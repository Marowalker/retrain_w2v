Bangle (Zingiber purpureum Rosc.)
rhizome extract (BRE) contains phenylbutenoid dimers (banglenes),
which exert neurotrophic effects and possess the potential capability
to regenerate hippocampal neurons in mice. The acute and chronic oral
toxicities of BRE powder were evaluated in Sprague–Dawley rats.
A dose of BRE powder was estimated to be higher than 2000 mg/kg containing
BRE 534 mg/kg as minimum lethal dose in a single-dose oral toxicity
study. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level for the BRE powder was
1000 mg/kg/day (BRE 267 mg/kg) in the 90 day oral toxicity study.
Four week clinical studies of BRE tablets in humans suggested that
the ingestion of BRE tablets within 850 mg/man/day (BRE 227 mg/man/day)
was safe for at least 1 month and in a usual manner. The Cmax, tmax, and AUC of cis- and trans-(E)-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-enes (c- and t-banglenes) were calculated after the ingestion
of BRE tablets (BRE 227 mg) and were 17.73 and 22.61 ng/mL, 1.8 and
1.8 h, and 71.47 and 95.53 ng/mL/h, respectively.

1 Introduction
Bangle
(Indonesian name), whose species name is Zingiber purpureum Rosc., belongs to Zingiberaceae
and is a tropical ginger that is widely distributed in Southeast Asia.
This ginger is described by the synonyms of Zingiber
cassumunar Roxb. and Zingiber montaum (Koenig) Dietrich in World Spice Plants.1 Bangle not only has been used as a spice but also has been applied
in the traditional Indonesian medicine known as “Jamu”
for treatment of fever, headaches, stomach pain, rheumatism, and obesity,
and it serves as an ingredient in postpartum herbal medicine.2 Previous studies on the rhizomes of Z. cassumunar, which is a synonym of Z. purpureum, reported the isolation of various types
of phenylbutenoids, curcuminoids, and terpennoids.3 In addition, they showed a number of biological activities
such as anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities,4−8 ovicidal9−11 and insecticidal activites,12,13 and cytotoxic14−17 and antibacterial activites18,19 as well as some enzyme
inhibition properties.20−22 Recently, clinical effects and safety evaluations
of the Z. cassumunar Roxb. rhizome
showed that it was useful for the treatment of pain reduction23,24 and estimated an oral no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for Z. cassumunar EtOH extract to be 1125 mg/kg body
weight/day for rats.25 On the other hand,
bangle rhizome contains chemical components similar to those of Z. cassumunar, and some compounds were found to have
neurotrophin-like activities. Among them, cis- and trans-3-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-4-[(E)-3,4-dimethoxystyryl]cyclohex-1-enes
(1) and (2) (named c- and t-banglenes), dimers of (E)-1-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)butadiene,
were identified as neurotrophic principles in the MeOH extract of
the rhizomes of bangle, which exhibited neuritogenic activity in PC12
cells at 25 μg/mL.26 Banglenes 1 and 2 were found not only to significantly
induce neurogenesis of PC12 cells but also to show protective activity
against cell death caused by deprivation of serum in primary cultured
mouse cortical neurons.26 Additionally,
we found that new curcuminoid 3 had an effect on accelerating
the prevention of Aβ42 aggregation.27 With regard to the in vivo studies, chronic treatment with banglenes 1 and 2 was able to enhance hippocampal neurogenesis
in dementia model olfactory bulbectomy mice.26 Moreover, chronic treatment of bangle EtOH extract was shown to
improve the spatial learning and memory deficits by enhancing hippocampal
neurogenesis in senescence-accelerated prone-8 (SAMP8) mice, which
are a model for the early stage of Alzheimer’s disease.28 Thus, t- and c-banglenes (1, 2) and curcuminoid 3 have been pharmaceutically verified as active principles
that are responsible for the promising improvement of cognitive impairment
affected by bangle rhizome EtOH extract (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structures of c-banglene (1), t-banglene (2), and curcuminoid
(3).

Although bangle has long
been utilized as an edible spice and medicinal
supplement in Indonesia and may be developed into a functional food,
which has neurotrophic effects on protecting cognitive impairment,
there is no documented toxicological study of bangle. Thus, safety
assessments are needed to ascertain the degree of safety of bangle
preparation. In this paper, we report safety assessment of bangle
rhizome extract ( abbreviated to BRE ) on rats and humans, and pharmacokinetics
study of c-and t-banglenes (1, 2), neurotrophic principles in BRE tablets
by measurement of their plasma concentration in humans.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Single-Dose Oral Toxicity
Study
No
deaths occurred in either sex in any dose group during the 14 day
observation period. Therefore, the minimum lethal dose of the BRE
powder was estimated to be higher than 2000 mg/kg body weight (BRE
534 mg/kg, c- and t-banglenes 118
mg/kg) for both males and females. There were no abnormal clinical
signs in any animal in either sex in the control group or in any dose
group during the observation period. The body weights of males and
females in each dose group were comparable to those of the control
group during the observation period, and there were no significant
differences in either sex from those of the control group during the
observation period (Table 1). There were no abnormalities in the external appearance
or the cranial, thoracic, or abdominal organs or tissues in any animal
in either sex in the control group or in any dose group.

As Matsui et al. report that c- and t-banglenes were detected in the brains of mice at 0.5 h
after oral
administration,26 clinical signs such as
abnormalities in external appearance, nutritional condition, posture,
behavior, and excrement of the rats were checked at 5, 15, 30 min,
1, 2, 4, and 6 h after the administration of 2000 mg/kg body weight
of the BRE powder. However, there were no abnormalities.

As
described above, the nontoxic dose level of BRE powder by single
oral administration to rats was 2000 mg/kg, and thus it was suggested
that its acute toxicity is extremely weak. This result is similar
to that reported by Koontongkaew25 for
the Z. cassumunar extract.

2.2 Ninety Day Oral Gavage Toxicity Study
A 90 day repeated-dose
oral toxicity study of the BRE powder was
conducted in the rats. Dose levels were set at 0 (vehicle: water for
injection), 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day, and the test formulations were
administered orally by gavage once every day using flexible stomach
tubes for 91 days.

No deaths occurred, and there were no animals
that showed clinical abnormalities caused by administration. In the
control group, one male transiently showed fracture of the incisor
from week 9 to 10 of administration. In addition, one female showed
subcutaneous mass in the perineal area from week 11 of administration.

There were no changes in the detailed clinical observation that
were caused by administration of the BRE powder in either sex. Furthermore,
the manipulative test, grip strength, and motor activity at week 12
of administration showed no significant differences in either sex
from those of the control group during the observation period (Tables 2 and 3).

There were no ophthalmological changes that were related
to the
administration of the BRE powder in either sex. The changes that were
observed are frequently encountered in rats of this strain and are
spontaneous changes. Urinalysis and water intake showed no test-article-related
changes in either sex (Table 5).

group was recorded, but this change was within the range of physiological
fluctuation since it was within the range of the historical background
data in the test facility.

However, these values were thought to be within the range of physiological
variations since they are largely within the range of the historical
background data of the test facility.

The results of the organ weight
measurements are shown in Tables 8 and 9 (relative organ weights).
For the liver, significantly high
values or a tendency toward a high value in the absolute weight and
a significantly high value in the relative weight were recorded in
the males in the 500 and 1000 mg/kg groups, respectively, and in the
females in the 1000 mg/kg group. For the kidneys, a significantly
high value in the absolute weight and a tendency toward high value
in the relative weight were recorded in the males in the 1000 mg/kg
group. However, these changes were thought to be within the range
of the physiological variations since there were no changes related
to the administration of the test article in any parameter of the
blood chemistry examination, there were no changes in the liver or
the kidneys that were related to the administration of the test article
in the histopathological examination, and the changes were largely
within the range of the historical background data of the test facility
for untreated animals. Otherwise, the absolute kidney weight in the
males in the 500 mg/kg group was significantly high, but it was not
thought to be a significant change since the relative weight was comparable
to that of the control group.

There were no necropsy-related changes
in any organ or tissue in
either sex, although incidental changes were noticed based on their
incidence. There were no histopathology-related changes in any organ
or tissue in either sex, although incidental changes in the animals
of this strain were observed at each time point.

Accordingly,
the no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) of BRE
powder was judged to be 1000 mg/kg/day (BRE 267 mg/kg/day, c- and t-banglenes 59 mg/kg/day) for both
males and females in this study. BRE gave the same result as Koontongkaew
et al.25 reported for Z.
cassumunar extract, although the dose was lower.

2.3 Clinical Study of Bangle Extract for 4 Weeks
There were no significant differences in the blood pressure and
pulse rate of the quintuple group compared to the usual group (Table 10). Variations within
the normal limits were noticed for mean corpuscular volume, and mean
corpuscular hemoglobin concentration in the blood count, and hemogram
(Table 10). No significant
differences between the groups in white blood cells, red blood cells,
platelet, hemoglobin, or hematocrit were noted.

There were no significant differences
in the blood biochemical
tests between the quintuple group and the usual group (Table 10). Differences were noted in
PT and APTT, but the variations were within the normal limits.

The blood triglyceride values of two subjects in the quintuple
group before ingestion were over reference. However, it was determined
that ingestion did not influence this value since their blood triglyceride
was still over the reference value after 4 weeks. The urinalysis did
not show abnormal results although the urine protein of one subject
in the quintuple group was 1+ before ingestion.

Consequently,
it was concluded that the ingestion of up to 850
mg/day BRE powder (BRE dose of 227 mg/day) is safe in a usual manner
for at least 1 month.

2.4 Concentrations of c- and t-Banglenes in Plasma
The
plasma of subjects was
analyzed with ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
spectrometer (UPLC-MS/MS) in order to confirm the transfer of banglene
into the body after the ingestion of 10 BRE tablets (BRE 227 mg, 50
mg of t- and c-banglenes). Peaks
at 3.6 and 3.9 min on the UPLC-MS/MS chromatogram (Figure 2) of the plasma at 1 h after
ingestion were due to t- and c-banglenes
(1 and 2), of which the concentrations were
13.93 ± 8.13 and 12.51 ± 7.03 ng/mL (mean ± SD), respectively.
The plasma concentration–time profiles of t- and c-banglenes after the ingestion showed a maximum
at 1.5 h (20.87 ± 8.62 and 16.46 ± 6.67 ng/mL) and decreased
at 2 h (16.98 ± 11.01 and 12.92 ± 7.99 ng/mL) and 6 h (2.89
± 1.00 and 1.91 ± 0.54 ng/mL), finally reaching 0.52 ±
0.30 and 0.42 ± 0.24 ng/mL at 24 h, respectively (Figure 3). The maximum concentrations
(Cmax), the times at maximum concentration
(tmax), the areas under the plasma concentration–time
curve (AUC), and the mean residence times (MRTs) calculated by no
compartment analysis are indicated in Table 11.

of BRE tablets (BRE 227 mg). The retention times at 2.15 and 2.30
min are assigned to t- and c-banglenes
(1 and 2), respectively.

a Subject: four males (32–54
years) and a female (50 years).

Both banglenes were promptly absorbed after ingestion of the BRE
powder, and their tmax value was 1.8 ±
0.3 h (mean ± SD). Further, the MRTs of c- and t-banglenes were 4.36 ± 1.17 and 4.45 ± 1.24 h,
so it is clear that the pharmacokinetics of both banglenes are not
different, nor do they show retentively. This result is analogous
to the pharmacokinetic evaluation in the plasma of mice that was reported
by Matsui et al. (Matsui, 2012).26 Accordingly,
it has been suggested that both banglenes can move from the blood
to the brain. The Cmax of c- and t-banglenes reached 17.73 ± 5.61 and
22.61 ± 6.70 ng/mL and their AUCs were 71.47 ± 26.17 and
95.53 ± 36.89 ng·h/mL (mean ± SD), respectively. These
differences in the values for c- and t-banglenes (Cmax: t/c = 1.27; AUC: t/c = 1.34)
are determined by the ratio of c- and t-ones (1.24) in the tablet.

3 Conclusions
In this study, a safety assessment of the acute and chronic oral
toxicities of BRE for SD rats was conducted, and clinical trials in
humans were evaluated. In the 90 day oral toxicity test, no deaths
occurred, and there were no animals that showed clinical abnormalities,
which were thought to be caused by administration. In addition, a
4 week clinical study of BRE tablets in humans suggested that the
ingestion of BRE tablets within BRE powder 850 mg/person/day (BRE
227 mg/person/day) is safe in the usual way in at least 1 month. These
studies suggest that BRE tablets are tolerable for single- and long-term
administrations. According to our assessment, BRE contains c- and t-banglenes, which exert neurotrophic
effects, enhance hippocampal neurogenesis, and improve spatial learning
and memory deficits and therefore has the potential to be considered
as a useful food for cognitive deficits as long as its intake does
not exceed 227 mg/person/day.

4.4 Powder and Tablets of Bangle
Rhizome Extract
as Test Substance
The sliced bangle rhizomes, which were
cultivated at Ponrogo in Indonesia, were heated and immersed in ethanol
for 3 days. The mixture was filtered and concentrated in NHI (Bandon,
Indonesia). To the concentrate imported from Indonesia, ethanol, sucrose
fatty acid ester (Mitsubisi-chemical Foods Corporation, Tokyo, Japan),
high branched cyclodextrin (Glico Nutrition Co., Ltd. Osaka, Japan),
and water were added. The mixture was distilled off ethanol under
reduced pressure and lyophilized to produce BRE powder. This powder
contained 26.7% BRE and 5.9% c- and t-banglenes (t/c = 1.24) on the
chromatogram by HPLC analysis.

BRE tablets (200 mg/tablet) containing
85 mg/tablet of BRE powder (22.7 mg/tablet of BRE containing 5 mg/tablet
of c- and t-banglenes), sucrose
fatty acid ester, and dextrin were made from powder, pregelatinized
starch (Asahi Kasei Chemicals, Tokyo, Japan), Xantan gum (Ina Food
Industry, Nagano, Japan), silicon dioxide (CDSL. Japan, Tokyo), and
shellac (Gifu Shellac Manufacturing, Gifu, Japan).

4.5 Preparation of c- and t-Banglenes
(1) and (2)
1-(3,4-Dimethoxyphenyl)buta-1,3-diene
was heated in the presence
of hydroquinone in toluene and separated by silica gel column chromatography
to yield c- and t-banglenes according
to the modified method of Tuntiwachwuttikul et al.29

4.6 Test Animals
For
single-dose and
90 day oral gavage toxicity studies, Sprague–Dawley strain
SPF rats (Crl:CD(SD)) (Atsugi Breeding Center, Charles River Laboratories
Japan, Inc.) were purchased and quarantined/acclimated to the test
environment.

4.7 Husbandry Conditions
The single-dose
and 90 day oral toxicity studies were conducted at BoZo Research Center
Inc. (Tokyo, Japan) in compliance with Good Laboratory Standard Regulations
(Ordinance No. 21 of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan)30−32 in accordance with OECD test guidelines33 and with acts/guidelines relating to animal welfare in Japan. In
addition, the studies were conducted under the approval of the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of the test facility (Approved No. G150068),
and the test facility has been authorized by the AAALAC International.

The animals were housed in an animal room and individually in the
area, and this housing was created by inserting a divider plate into
the plastic cages (Hanyu Seimitsu Co. Ltd., Saitama, Japan). For each
area, bedding (ALPHA-dri, Shepherd Specialty Papers, Inc.) was provided,
and enrichment (Harlan Laboratories Japan Co. Ltd.) was given once
a week during the period of animal use. Animals were allowed free
access to pelleted diet CR-LPF (irradiation-sterilized, Oriental Yeast
Co., Ltd. Tokyo Japan) using stainless steel feeders and tap water
(Gotemba City Water, via an automatic water-supply system).

4.8 Single-Dose Oral Toxicity Study
The
test animals (6 weeks old; n = 5/sex/group) were
administered a single oral dose of BRE powder at 0, 250, 700, and
2000 mg/kg body weight (20 mL/kg body weight of 0, 12.5, 35, and 100
mg/mL in water for injection, respectively) by gavage. The animals
were observed frequently on clinical signs such as abnormalities in
external appearance, nutritional condition, posture, behavior, and
excrement for the first 6 h after administration (preadministration,
immediately, and 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 4, and 6 h after administration),
and thereafter once a day for 14 days (day 0: the day of administration).
Body weight was measured in the morning on the day of administration
and days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 after administration. All animals
were sacrificed by exsanguination (via the abdominal aorta) under
isoflurane anesthesia after the 14 day observation period. External
appearance and organs/tissues in the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal
cavities were observed macroscopically.

4.9 Lethal
Dose and Statistical Analyses
The approximate lethal dose
(the minimum lethal dose) was estimated
on the basis of the cumulative mortality for 14 days after administration.
Body weight was analyzed by multiple comparison. First, analysis of
variance was conducted by the Bartlett test (level of significance:
1%). If variances were homogeneous, data were analyzed by the Dunnett
test, whereas heterogeneous data were analyzed by the Steel test between
the control group and each dose group (levels of significance: 5 and
1%, two-tailed).34−36 Analysis was done using SAS Release 9.1.3 (SAS Institute
Inc.).

4.10 Ninety Day Oral Gavage Toxicity Study
The oral administration period to the test animals (6 weeks old; n = 10/sex/group) was set at 13 weeks (91 days). The frequency
of administration was once a day (7 times per week). The dose volume
was set at 10 mL/kg body weight, and test formulations were administered
by gavage using flexible stomach tubes. For animals in the control
group, the vehicle (water for injection) was administered in the same
manner. The dose was set at 0, 500, or 1000 mg/kg (0, 50, or 100 mg/mL;
dose volume: 10 mL/kg), and a total of three groups including a control
group were provided.

All animals were observed for clinical
signs including external appearance, nutritional condition, posture,
behavior, and excrement three times a day before dosing, immediately
after, and 1–3 h after dosing during the administration period:
animals were observed twice a day, before dosing and immediately after
dosing, on the days for detailed clinical observation.

The detailed
clinical observation, manipulative test, and measurements
of grip strength were conducted on all animals in week 12. All animals
were weighed three times on days 1, 4, and 7 in week 1 and twice a
week thereafter every 3 or 4 days. Food consumption was measured on
days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70, 77, 84, and 91. The
ophthalmology examination with an indirect ophthalmoscope (Omega 200,
HEINE Optotechnik GmbH & Co, Germany) was done for all animals
on day 0 and for 6 animals (with animal numbers 01–06 in each
group) in each group on day 90.

On week 13 (days 85–86),
after dosing on the day of examination,
all animals were individually placed in a wire mesh cage with a urine
collector, and 4 h urine was collected under deprivation of feed but
with free access to water, and then 20 h urine was collected with
free access to feed and water. The urinalysis was carried out with
Multistix (Urinary Automatic Analyzer CLINITEK 500, Siemens Healthcare
Diagnostics Inc, Germany). Urinary sediments on the 4 h urine samples
were examined with a microscope. Osmotic pressure was measured on
the 20 h urine samples. One day excretions of sodium, potassium, and
chloride were calculated from the 24 h urine volume, and the concentrations
were measured.

At the scheduled necropsy on the day following
the end of the administration
period, all animals were subjected to laparotomy under isoflurane
anesthesia after fasting overnight (for approximately 16–21
h) from the previous day, and blood was collected and used for measurement
of hematology, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin
time, fibrinogen, and blood chemistry.

After collecting blood
samples, all the organs and tissues of all
animals were carefully necropsied. Then, the organs and tissues of
all animals were weighed, and organ weight per 100 g body weight (relative
weight) was calculated based on the body weight at the time of necropsy
and absolute organ weight. All of the organs and tissues of all animals
were fixed and preserved in phosphate buffer containing 10% formalin
(v/v), embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E).

4.11 Statistical Analyses
Quantitative
data of open field observation, quantitative data of manipulative
tests, measurements of grip strength and motor activity, body weight,
food consumption, water intake, quantitative data of urinalyses, hematology,
blood chemistry, and organ weights were analyzed by multiple comparison.
First, analysis of variance was conducted by the Bartlett test (level
of significance: 1%).34−36 If variances were homogeneous, data were analyzed
by the foregoing method.

4.12 Clinical Study of Bangle
Extract: Study Design
The present study was performed by
open trial from July to September
2015. The protocol of this study was approved by the institutional
ethics committee and conducted according to the guidelines in the
Declaration of Helsinki. All procedures involving subjects were approved
by the Science Research Center Alternative Medicine Nonprofit Organization.

4.13 Subjects
Sixteen healthy adults,
who were judged suitable by the doctor and handed in written consent,
were selected as subjects and divided into two groups in this study.
The usual ingestion group was five females (21–24 years) and
three males (21−23 years). The quintuple group was six males
(32–67 years) and two females (43, 50 years).

4.14 Test Schedule
Measurements were
taken for blood pressure, pulse rate, blood count, hemogram, biochemical
blood tests, and urinalysis from each subject before and after the
ingestion. The usual ingestion group ingested one BRE tablet every
morning and evening (45.4 mg of BRE and 10 mg of t- and c-banglenes per day) for 4 weeks. The quintuple
group ingested five BRE tablets every morning and evening (227 mg
of BRE and 50 mg of t- and c-banglenes
per day) for 4 weeks. All subjects refrained from ingesting a new
health food during the test period. To measure plasma concentrations,
blood from each of the five subjects (32–54 years; four males
and a female) in the quintuple group was collected in tubes containing
EDTA-2K (VENOJec T II glass tube, TERUMO, Japan) at 1, 2, 4, and 24
h after the ingestion of ten BRE tablets on the 28th day, centrifuged
to obtain plasma, and maintained at 80 °C.

4.15 Safety Evaluation
Safety was evaluated
according to National Cancer Institute CTAE v4.0-Japanese JOCG. Subjective
symptoms, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood count, hemogram, biochemical
test of blood, and urinalysis were evaluated. Adverse events were
defined as all undesirable events including subjective symptoms, abnormal
objective findings, and abnormal changes in this test and vital signs.

4.16 Statistical Analyses
Statistical
analysis was performed using paired t-tests, and
differences with p-value <0.05 were considered
as statistically significant.

4.17 Sample
Preparation of Plasma for UPLC-MS/MS
Analysis
To 0.2 mL of the subject plasma, 0.2 mL of 2-propanol
was added, mixed, and centrifuged for 2 min. The supernatant was passed
through an Oasis PRiMe HLB Extraction Cartridge after addition of
10 μL of ultrapure water. This cartridge was washed two times
with 0.5 mL of 5% methanol, and then swept two times with 0.5 mL of
acetonitrile each time. After evaporation of the acetonitrile eluate
with a Conbinievapo, the residue was dissolved in 0.2 mL of acetonitrile
and centrifugally filtered through a 0.2 μm filter. Next, 1
μL of the filtrate was injected into the UPLC-MS/MS.

4.18 UPLC-MS/MS Analysis
The obtained
filtrate was analyzed by a UPLC system. The cis-
and trans-banglenes of the filtrate were separated
from the other peaks by using the C18 column at 35 °C. Injection
was achieved with an autosampler kept at 10 °C. The mobile phase
consisting of acetonitrile and an ultrapure aqueous solution of 0.01%
ammonium acetate was used. The gradient system was as follows: 70–98%
acetonitrile (0–6 min) and 98% acetonitrile (5 min) at a flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min. To re-equilibrate, 70% acetonitrile was flowed
through the system for 5 min.

MS/MS was carried out using a
Quadrupole Time of Flight mass spectrometer (Waters) with an Electrospray
Ionization (ESI) interface. The ESI source was set at the positive
ionization mode. The daughter ion (C16H19O2)+m/z 243, which
liberated from (M + H)+m/z 381, for the dimethoxyphenylbutadien dimer, banglene (C24H28O4), was selected as the detecting ion under
the collision energy of 15 eV. Data analysis was performed by MassLynx
software (Waters, Tokyo).

4.19 Standard and Quality Control
Samples
Stock solutions were prepared as standard solutions
prepared by diluting
the original methanol solution that contained concentrations of c- and t-banglenes of 0.5 mg/mL each to
concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 ng/mL with the addition of
methanol. These stock solutions were kept at −40 °C. Sample
solutions containing concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ng/mL
each were prepared by adding the original solution to human plasma.
Recovery of these sample solutions was 80–120%. Accordingly,
the assay was carried out by the absolute calibration method.
