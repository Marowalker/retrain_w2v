Thorough understandings on the real-time
kinetics involved in DNA
adsorption on a solid surface is essential in various fields, such
as in DNA hybridization studies, DNA extraction and purification,
DNA-based biosensing, and gene-based medicine discovery. Herein, the
real-time properties of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) adsorption onto
functional silica surfaces under various conditions were investigated
using an evanescent wave optical biosensing platform. Results demonstrated
that the driving force and adsorption mechanism of DNA were closely
related to the kind of functional groups on the silica surfaces. The
main driving forces of DNA adsorption onto hydroxyl- and protein-modified
solid surfaces were the hydrophobic interaction, hydrogen bonding,
and the interaction between DNA phosphate and functional groups on
the silica surface, which strengthened with increased ionic strength.
However, the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge
of DNA and positive charge of the amino silica surface was likely
the most important factor influencing DNA adsorption onto the amino
surface. This influence can be reduced by increasing the ionic strength.
Although low-ionic-strength Mg2+ provided a greater adsorption
efficiency than high-ionic-strength Na+, the balance of
ssDNA adsorption onto hydroxyl- and ovalbumin (OVA)-modified silica
surfaces was achieved faster in the presence of Na+ than
in the presence of Mg2+. DNA adsorption was also influenced
significantly by pH, and the hydroxyl- and OVA-modified surfaces exhibited
the strongest adsorption at pH 3.0, whereas DNA adsorption onto the
amino surface increased with increased pH. DNA adsorption onto various
functional surfaces could be perfectly fitted by second-order Langmuir
models, indicating that the process was a single-molecular-layer adsorption.

Introduction
The kinetics of DNA
adsorption onto various solid substrates has
attracted great scientific attention because of its widespread bioapplications,
such as nucleic acid isolation and purification,1,2 clinical
genetic analysis,3,4 gene delivery,5,6 and
biosensor design.7,8 Silica (i.e., amorphous silicon
dioxide, SiO2) is an ideal substrate for DNA adsorption
because of the material’s advantages such as smooth surface,
stable chemical properties, low toxicity, cost-effectiveness, and
easy application in micro/nanoscale devices.9,10 The
driving forces of DNA adsorption onto a silica surface include hydrophobic
interactions, electrostatic interaction, and hydrogen bonding between
DNA and the silicon dioxide surface.4,9,10 The interaction between DNA phosphate and silanol
groups on the silica surface was also regarded as a principle mechanism
for DNA adsorption.10 Although electrostatic
repulsion exists between negatively charged DNA and a negatively charged
silica surface above its isoelectric point (IEP), the phosphate silanol
and hydrophobic interactions are sufficiently strong to overcome DNA/silica
electrostatic repulsion, thus leading to DNA binding to the silica
surface. Several investigators proposed that DNA adsorption occurs
through hydrogen bonding between unwound nucleotides and the silica
surface.4,10−12 By changing solution
pH, DNA can be adsorbed when the surface is positively charged and
desorbed almost completely when the surface is tuned to be negatively
charged.10−12 Cations, such as sodium (Na+) and magnesium
(Mg2+) ions, can be added to neutralize the negative charge
for shielding electrostatic interaction and compressing the electrostatic
double layer surrounding the DNA and the silica surface, which facilitates
DNA adsorption onto silicon dioxide.

To date, DNA adsorption
onto an acid-treated silica surface have
been widely studied. Acid treatment can hydrolyze the silica surface
and increase its silanol group concentration. As such, the treatment
adds benefits to DNA adsorption.10 The
physical or chemical modification of a silica surface is another approach
to effectively adsorb DNA. For example, the silica surface modified
with amino groups can increase the DNA adsorption amount by introducing
direct electrostatic interactions. By contrast, DNA desorption is
limited because of the lack of repulsive force. DNA could also be
adsorbed effectively onto the nanoparticle surface modified by protein
as a natural ampholyte with specified IEP. Meanwhile, the amount of
DNA that binds to a silica surface depends on solution pH,12−14 ionic type, and strength,4,10−14 as well as DNA conformation.14,15 Numerous techniques,
including equilibrium bulk depletion assay technologies, evanescent
wave-induced fluorescent spectroscopy,16 atomic force microscopy,17 microscopy
using intercalating fluorescent dyes,17,18 and dual polarization
interferometry,19,20 have been employed to investigate
the adsorption mechanism and enumerate the attractive forces between
DNA and the silica surface. However, most of these techniques do not
allow real-time monitoring of DNA adsorption kinetics. As a result,
some key information is lost.12 Recently,
a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring was used
to measure the kinetics of DNA adsorption onto a piezoelectric quartz
crystal.12

In this study, we investigated
the adsorption kinetics of single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) onto a silicon dioxide (quartz) optic fiber probe by monitoring
the real-time fluorescence changes using an evanescent wave all-fiber
optical biosensor (EWAB). Previous studies suggested that both double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) and ssDNA can be absorbed by the silicon dioxide surface.21 For analytical and biomedical applications,
attaching ssDNA with well-defined sequences, such as aptamers, is
more desirable. The ssDNA can bind to silicon dioxide more strongly
than dsDNA when solution pH is above the IEP of silicon dioxide up
to neutral pH.13,18 This condition increases the
opportunity for hydrophobic interaction between the unpaired bases
of ssDNA and the silicon dioxide surface.13,18 Herein, a 20 bp random ssDNA sequence was regarded as a model for
investigating DNA adsorption kinetics. Several functional optic fiber
probes, including bare, hydroxyl, amino, and protein-modified optic
fibers, were prepared to investigate ssDNA adsorption kinetics. The
effects of pH and ionic species and strength on ssDNA adsorption onto
the silicon dioxide surface were studied. To our best knowledge, few
studies have compared the DNA adsorption kinetics onto various functional
surfaces. Our experiments confirmed some previously proposed adsorption
mechanisms of ssDNA onto the solid surface. Moreover, our results
also provided additional important ssDNA adsorption kinetics information
by real-time fluorescence trace. These results help us increase understanding
of the basic principles underlying the interactions between solid
surfaces and nucleic acids.

Results
Characteristics of Functional
Optic Fiber Probes
Starting
from an etched optic fiber probe, we assembled a covalently bonded
molecular monolayer through a multistep chemical process (Figure 1).21,22

optic fiber probe; fiber B, hydroxyl optic fiber probe; fiber C, amino
optic fiber probe; and fiber D, OVA-modified optic fiber probe.

To characterize the functional
optic fiber probes, the results
of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were shown in Table 1 and Figure S2. After etched by HF and washed by water, the tapered probe
surface mainly contained carbon, oxygen, and silicon. Then, the elemental
composition is basically not changed after acid treatment. However,
after 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) was coupled onto the fiber
optic probe, the XPS spectra showed nitrogen (1.24%) because the APTS
contained nitrogen, which showed that the APTS successfully cross-linked
to the optic fiber probe through conjugation of the hydroxyl case
on the probe surface and the silane group of APTS. Finally, ovalbumin
(OVA) was covalently conjugated onto the probe surface using the glutaraldehyde
solution. The amount of nitrogen on the probe surface increased from
0.46 to 2.25% because of protein coupling.

Hydrophobic/hydrophilic property is essential in DNA adsorption.
Hence, the hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of the silica-based
surface were characterized after modification by different functional
groups. The optic fiber probe is cylindrical; hence, its contact angle
cannot be obtained. The contact angle of the silicon dioxide plate
was determined using the above-mentioned methods. In this case, the
plate functioned as the optic fiber probe. The bare plate was highly
hydrophilic (<10°) as in previous research.25 After the plate was treated by acid, the hydroxyl silicon
dioxide surface attained a large contact angle (24.8°) (Figure S3). Specially, the hydrophobic property
of the silica-based surface increased when hydroxylated. Furthermore,
after modification by APTS, the amino group was conjugated on the
silica surface, and the silica surface became the most hydrophobic
at a contact angle of 72.3°. Therefore, the amino fiber C was
likely hydrophobic after covalent bonding with APTS. Finally, the
OVA was covalently bound to the amino silica surface at a contact
angle of 25.3°. The OVA-modified surface became hydrophobic as
did the hydroxyl surface owing to protein properties.

Kinetics of
ssDNA Adsorption onto Functional Optic Fiber Probes
under Monovalent Cation
To obtain information about the adsorption
kinetics in real time and to investigate the adsorption behavior of
ssDNA adsorbed onto the surface, we studied ssDNA adsorption to the
optic fiber probe surface using EWAB under different ionic species
and strengths. To study the effect of ionic strength on ssDNA adsorption
onto optic fiber probes, we used the ultrapure water but not the phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) to prepare ssDNA solution. In this section, different
concentrations of Na+ were added to the ssDNA solution
and were introduced into the optofluidic cell. Concurrently, the real-time
fluorescence signal was recorded by EWAB.

In these experiments,
we found that the functionalization of the probe surface obviously
affected the adsorption kinetics and the amount of DNA adsorbed. Hence,
different shaped fluorescence response curves were obtained. First,
scarce DNA amount was adsorbed on the optic fiber probe surface unless
the etched optic fiber probes were functionally pretreated (Figure 2a), as in previous
reports.25 When Cy5.5-labeled DNA was delivered
over the probe surface, a weak fluorescence signal was detected. Then,
balance was rapidly reached once the Cy5.5-labeled DNA solution filled
the optofluidic cell. No adsorption process was observed, and the
fluorescence signal rapidly reached the baseline after washing with
water. In general, the DNA–silica interaction is electrostatically
unfavorable because DNA and the silica surface are both negatively
charged under most experimental conditions.25 Adding electrolytes shields electrostatic repulsion. However, despite
the high Na+ concentration employed, fiber A only exhibited
a slight response to the addition of the Cy5.5-labeled DNA (Figure 2e). Thus, the electrostatic
repulsion was not the response in this case. Silica surfaces can display
one or two OH groups per surface silica atom (called isolated or geminal
hydroxyls) besides bridging ethereal oxygens between silica surface
atoms.26 Even so, perfect SiO2 (quartz) exists mainly in the bridging ethereal oxygen conformation
and possesses no free surface hydroxyl groups, thus producing a highly
hydrophilic surface (contact angle <10°). The high hydrophilicity
of the probe is likely a main factor why DNA did not adsorb onto the
probe surface. Furthermore, the effective distance of the evanescent
wave was less than 100 nm and only Cy5.5 in this range can be excited.
Thus, we can assume that the fluorescence signal to be detected may
originate from the free Cy5.5-labeled DNA in solution near the probe
surface. This notion suggests that the free fluorescence-labeled DNA
only slightly contributes to the detected fluorescence signal detected
by EWAB.

measurements.

When the optic fiber
probe was treated using piranha solution,
a typical adsorption process was observed when Cy5.5-labeled ssDNA
was introduced over the probe surface (Figure 2b). Acid treatment of silica hydrolyzes the
surface and increases the silanol groups of the probe surface. The
amount of ssDNA adsorbed initially increased rapidly in the presence
of Na+ (Figure 2b). With continuous adsorption, the adsorbed ssDNA increased
less rapidly for about 100 s until a plateau was reached. The adsorption
of ssDNA onto the probe surface may be attributed to the hydrophobic
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and the interaction between DNA phosphate
and the probe surface silanol groups. Moreover, the fluorescence intensified
with increased Na+ concentration (Figure 2b,e). This phenomenon may be ascribed to
the shielding against electrostatic repulsion and compression of the
electrostatic double layer surrounding the DNA and the silica surface
derived from electrolyte addition. Then, these effects facilitate
DNA adsorption onto silica. Previous studies demonstrated that hydrated
Na+ can interact with the oxygen atoms of DNA phosphate
groups directly or through hydrogen bonds with metal-coordinated water
molecules.27,28 The electrostatic neutralization
of cations by the DNA phosphate backbone could reduce the thickness
of the effective DNA diameter and compact the DNA onto the probe surface.
This occurrence increases fluorescence-labeled DNA adsorption onto
the probe surface and consequently intensifies the detected fluorescence
signal.

Then, the probe surfaces were further functionalized
by aminosilane-coupling
reagents. The amount of ssDNA adsorbed initially increased because
of the strong electrostatic attraction between the negatively charged
DNA phosphate groups and the positively charged amino groups on the
amino probe surface (Figure 2c), especially at low cation concentrations. The hydrophobic
interaction between the DNA and the amino probe surface may also serve
as another important reason. The adsorbed ssDNA gradually increased,
and a plateau was reached at longer time than that with the hydroxyl
probes. Moreover, the fluorescence signal change differs from that
of the hydroxyl probes (Figure 2c). The adsorption capacity decreased with increased Na+ concentration because the fluorescence signal decreased with
increased cation strength (Figure 2e). When Na+ was 2.0 M, few DNA adsorbed
onto the probe surface, which was different from previous results.25 This appearance may be attributed to the use
of different buffer solutions, and our solution only contained Na+. Hydrated Na+ can interact with the oxygen atoms
of DNA phosphate groups;27 hence, the electrostatic
neutralization of cations with the DNA phosphate backbone could reduce
the electrostatic interaction between DNA and the silica surface with
increased Na+ concentration. Therefore, DNA may even be
positively charged at high Na+ concentration, which resulted
in the electrostatic repulsion between DNA and the positively charged
amino probe surface. Thus, a low amount of DNA adsorbed onto the probes
surface.

When the probe surfaces were covalently coupled by
OVA, the resultant
DNA adsorption performance was similar to that of the hydroxyl probes.
The amount of ssDNA adsorbed initially increased when Cy5.5-labeled
DNA was introduced into the sample cell. With continuous adsorption,
the adsorbed ssDNA increased less rapidly for about 50 s until a plateau
was reached. Moreover, the adsorption capacity increased with cation
strength linearly at low cation concentration and reached a plateau
when the Na+ concentration exceeded 0.5 M. The OVA-modified
probes achieved a slightly higher adsorbed amount of DNA than that
by the hydroxyl probes in the presence of Na+. As a result,
both probes became negatively charged with similar contact angles.
However, the OVA-modified probes were more sensitive to cation strength
than hydroxyl probes because the adsorption slope of the former was
higher than that of the latter (Figure 2e). When the Na+ concentration was 0.25
M, the fluorescence signal was about 70% of the maximum fluorescence
signal value.

Kinetics of ssDNA Adsorption onto Functional
Optic Fiber Probes
under Divalent Cation
In this section, the effect of divalent
cation strength (Mg2+) on DNA adsorption onto the probe
surface was investigated. Similar to observations under the use of
monovalent cation, very small DNA amount adsorbed onto the bare optic
fiber surface when Cy5.5-labeled DNA was delivered over the probe
surface (Figure 3a).
Moreover, regardless of the increase in Mg2+ concentration,
fiber A had shown a weak response for the Cy5.5-labeled DNA (Figure 3e).

Figure 3 Kinetics of ssDNA adsorption
onto functional optic fiber probes
at different Mg2+ concentrations. (a) Fiber A; (b) fiber
B with hydroxyl groups; (c) fiber C with amino groups; (d) fiber D
covered with OVA; and (e) fluorescence signal of different functional
optic fiber probes at equilibrium adsorption, in which the ssDNA concentration
was 20 nM. The error bars represent standard deviation from three
measurements.

When Cy5.5-labeled DNA
was introduced over the hydroxyl probe surface,
a typical adsorption process was observed in the presence of Mg2+ (Figure 3b). However, although the DNA adsorption amount increased over time
when the Mg2+ concentration exceeded 50 mM, the adsorption
curves obviously differed as the Mg2+ concentration varied
from 10 to 50 mM. In the latter case, the fluorescence signal detected
by EWAB initially increased rapidly and then decreased with continuous
adsorption. This trend is difficult to be observed unless a real-time
adsorption kinetic curve is recorded. According to previous studies,
DNA and divalent cation could form DNA/cation complexes and be adsorbed
onto the solid surface.29 At low ion concentration,
adsorbed DNA film is viscoelastic.29 Specially,
DNA initially adsorbs in a relatively flat conformation and interacts
with the silica surface through many binding sites. As the DNA surface
coverage increases, the adsorbed DNA rearranges, extending further
into solution while interacting with the silica surface through fewer
binding contacts, thus leading to a decrease in the fluorescence signal.
At high ion concentration, the adsorbed DNA layer is rigid, the adsorbed
DNA did not rearrange, and the detected fluorescence signal increases
with the process of DNA adsorption. However, these results appeared
only when the hydroxyl probe was used.

When Cy5.5-labeled ssDNA
was introduced over the amino probe surface,
the amount of ssDNA adsorbed initially increased, especially in the
absence of or in low Mg2+ concentrations (Figure 3c). These effects should contribute
to the strong electrostatic and hydrophobic interaction between the
negatively charged DNA phosphate groups and the positively charged
amino groups on the functional probe. With continuous adsorption,
the adsorbed ssDNA increased less rapidly and a plateau was reached.
Adsorption capacity decreased following the increase of Mg2+ concentration as that observed in the presence of Na+. This effect was due to the decreased fluorescence signal with increased
cation strength (Figure 3e). DNA and Mg2+ can form DNA/Mg2+ complexes;
hence, the electrostatic neutralization of cations with DNA could
reduce electrostatic attraction between the DNA and silica surface
with increased Mg2+ concentration. This phenomenon results
in diminished DNA adsorption onto the silica surface and a weak fluorescence
signal. We assumed that with increased cation strength, the charges
of the amino surfaces and DNA phosphate groups were screened by the
high salt concentration, leading to decreased DNA adsorption onto
the probe surface. However, part of the DNA may still adsorb onto
the probe surface, unlike that in presence of Na+. The
amount of DNA adsorption did not decrease with increased Mg2+ concentration even when the Mg2+ concentration exceeded
50 mM. This observation showed that the interaction of DNA with Mg2+ differed from that with Na+. DNA/Mg2+ complexes only partially neutralized the DNA charges and did not
induce a conversion to positive charge.

The amount of ssDNA
adsorbed initially increased when Cy5.5-labeled
ssDNA was introduced over the OVA-modified fiber optic probe (Figure 3d) similar to that
in the hydroxyl probes. The efficiency of DNA adsorption onto the
probe surface increased over time. The absorption efficiency augmented
with raised Mg2+ concentration because of the suppressed
electrostatic attraction between the positively charged particle surface
and the DNA phosphate groups. The OVA-modified probes attained a slightly
lower adsorbed DNA amount than that obtained through hydroxylation
probes. Moreover, the adsorption capacity linearly increased with
cation strength at low cation concentration and reached a plateau
when the Mg2+ concentration exceeded 50 mM.

Kinetics of
ssDNA Adsorption under Different pH Conditions
Besides cation
species, DNA adsorption and the corresponding conformation
are also influenced significantly by pH.10,14 The behaviors of DNA adsorption onto various functional optic fiber
probes under different pH values (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) were also investigated
(Figure 4). For the
bare optic fiber probe, very small DNA amount adsorbed onto the probe
surfaces at all pH conditions (Figure 4a). Hence, DNA adsorption onto bare optic fiber probe
was also not affected by pH.

Figure 4 Kinetics of ssDNA adsorption onto functional
optic fiber probes
under different pH values. (a) Fiber A; (b) fiber B with hydroxyl
groups; (c) fiber C with amino groups; (d) fiber D with OVA protein;
and (e) fluorescence signal of different functional optic fiber probes
at equilibrium adsorption, in which the ssDNA concentration was 20
nM. The error bars represent standard deviation from three measurements.

For the acid-treatment probe,
the amount of DNA adsorbed increased
over time at pH < 3.0 (Figure 4b). However, the amount of DNA adsorption initially
increased over time and then slightly decreased at pH > 3.0. This
observation may be related to the interaction strength between the
DNA and the silica surface similar to that in the presence of Mg2+. The DNA adsorption efficiency onto the probe surface was
maximum at pH 3.0 and decreased sharply when solution pH was less
than 3.0 or higher than 5.0 (Figure 4b,e). These results were qualitatively similar to those
in previous studies.12,30 Increasing pH increases the electrostatic
repulsion between the DNA and silica, which is likely a major factor
contributing to the decreased quantity of adsorbed DNA.

pH effects
on DNA adsorption onto the aminosilane-modified optic
fiber probe were observed between pH 1 and 9 (Figure 4c). Efficient DNA adsorption increased with
increased pH, and the maximum DNA adsorption occurred at pH 9.0, indicating
the correlation of DNA adsorption with surface positive charges. Amino
groups present at pH 9.0 are expected to be deprotonated because the
pKa of aminosilane is estimated at 9–10.14,29 By contrast, the protonation of amino groups on the aminosilane-modified
probes is expected at pH less than 9. Generally, low pH and high salt
concentration are beneficial to DNA adsorption. However, DNA adsorption
at different pH values and salt concentrations depended on the existing
functional group and hydrophobic property of the solid surface in
our experimental results.

The kinetics of ssDNA adsorption onto
the OVA-modified probes under
different pH was also investigated. The DNA absorption efficiency
onto the probe surface was highest at pH 3.0 and decreased sharply
to 20% when the solution pH was risen to 5.0 (Figure 4d). At pH > 5.0, almost no DNA absorption
onto the probe surface was detected. The absorption efficiency decreased
with increased pH because of the suppressed electrostatic attraction
between the positively charged particle surface and the phosphate
group of DNA (pK1 = 2.1). At pH > 5.0,
DNA absorption was blocked almost completely by the electrostatic
repulsion because both DNA and the probe surface were negatively charged
in this pH region. The OVA-modified probe attained a higher DNA adsorption
amount than the hydroxyl probe because the former probe was positively
charged at pH lower than the IEP and negatively charged at pH higher
than IEP. Meanwhile, DNA was adsorbed onto the probe surface at low
pH by direct electrostatic attraction.

Kinetic Analysis of DNA
Adsorption onto the Silica Surface
Before the discussion
of the DNA adsorption kinetics, we focus
on the total fluorescence signal detected by EWAB, which is composed
of the following two components 1  where It is the
total fluorescence intensity, I0 is the
background baseline intensity, and Ih is
the contribution from ssDNA adsorption onto the surface. As above
mentioned, the contribution of the fluorescence signal from free ssDNA
in solution could be negligible. Given that the fluorescence signal
(I) is proportional to the coverage Γ, the eqs 5–7 can be changed as following

Langmuir adsorption 2  

Langmuir adsorption with first-order 3  

Second-order Langmuir adsorption 4  where Imax is
the maximum fluorescence signal when the DNA probe of the sensor surface
is saturated by a target DNA sequence.

To simplify, we reduced
the background baseline intensity (I0)
of the real-time kinetic curves, and the
initial time was calculated from the sampling. Figure 5 revealed that a part of the ssDNA adsorption
kinetic curves determined by EWAB was fitted to various Langmuir models.
The fitted Langmuir models depend on the correlation coefficient (R2 value), which indicates the relationship between
the adsorption data and the theoretical models. The parameter R2 calculated from various Langmuir models are
listed in Table S1. The second-order Langmuir R2 values for the hydroxyl probe, amino probe,
and OVA-modified probe in monovalent ion solution were 0.9949, 0.9976,
and 0.9971, respectively. These values were higher than those fitted
by the other two models. Similarly, the Langmuir R2 values for hydroxyl probe, amino probe, and OVA-modified
probe in divalent ion solution were 0.9969, 0.9955, and 0.9970, respectively.
These values were also higher than those fitted by the other two models.
These findings signified that the second-order Langmuir sorption model
provides better fitting than the Langmuir model and Langmuir model
with first-order desorption to describe the DNA adsorption onto the
silica samples. Hence, the DNA adsorption was homogeneously applied
across the probe surface. To further validate this notion, we employed
the Freundlich model to fit the adsorption kinetics model of ssDNA
(Figure S4), which was the multilayer adsorption
model. The Freundlich R2 values were much
lower (Table S2), indicating that the Freundlich
model did not fit the adsorption kinetic curves of ssDNA. These results
suggested that DNA adsorption onto these surfaces was achieved by
monolayer adsorption.

Discussion and Conclusions
One chief conclusion from our work is the close relation of the
mechanism of DNA adsorption onto solid surfaces with the surface’s
functional group. Despite the breadth of prior research, the driving
force and binding mechanism of DNA adsorption onto the solid surface
remain relatively controversial. The hydrophobic interactions and
hydrogen bonding of unpaired bases were regarded as the main driving
force of such DNA adsorption.4 Several
studies concluded that the phosphate–silanol interaction is
an important factor in the interaction between DNA and various types
of silica surfaces.10 Balladur et al. found
that electrostatic interactions between the negatively charged DNA
and the amino silica wafers played a major role in the adsorption
process.25 However, Melzak et al. assumed
that intermolecular hydrogen bond formation in the DNA–silica
contact layer was responsible for the DNA adsorption.14 These controversial conclusions may be contributed to the
following reasons. On one hand, the different solid surface pretreatment
methods formed various functional surfaces and generated various adsorption
mechanisms. On the other hand, most previous studies were performed
by bulk depletion methods. Under such strategy, some important dynamic
information on the DNA adsorption process is ignored or undetectable
and may achieve misleading results.

In our study, real-time
kinetic detection provides highly intuitive
understanding of DNA adsorption onto the solid surface. Actually,
the driving force and binding mechanism of DNA adsorption differ among
various functional solid surfaces. First, the adsorption kinetics
of DNA is closely related to the hydrophobilic/hydrophobic properties
of the solid surface. A bare fiber optic probe is highly hydrophobic
because it exists mainly in the bridging ethereal oxygen conformation
and possesses no free surface hydroxyl groups.25 In this case, very small DNA amounts are adsorbed onto
the surface at any salt concentration and pH condition. However, after
the solid surface was modified by hydroxyl and amino groups and protein,
the hydrophobic property of the solid surface obviously increased,
and adsorption amount of DNA changed with variations in salt concentration
and pH. Second, the main driving force of DNA adsorption onto hydroxyl-
and protein-modified solid surfaces originate from the hydrophobic
interactions, hydrogen bonding, and the interaction between DNA phosphate
and functional groups on the silica surface. The electrostatic repulsion
stems from the negative charges of DNA and the silica surface, which
can be screened by increasing the ionic strength. Finally, the electrostatic
attraction between the negative charge of DNA and positive charge
of the amino silica surface is likely the most important factor in
DNA adsorption onto the amino solid surface. This electrostatic attraction
can be reduced by raising the ionic strength.

Another main result
is discrepancy in the effects of monovalent
and divalent cation on DNA adsorption. Similar to previous studies,
low-ionic-strength divalent cations provide greater attachment efficiencies
than high-ionic-strength solutions containing monovalent cations.
The balance of ssDNA adsorption onto the hydroxyl- and OVA-modified
silica surface is achieved faster in the presence of Na+ than in the presence of Mg2+. This difference may be
related to the adsorption mechanism of DNA in the presence of Na+ or Mg2+. The phosphate diesters on the DNA backbone
are strong acids and render DNA a strong polyelectrolyte carrying
negative charges at most solution pH. Although monovalent cations
(e.g., Na+) do not directly interact with the DNA backbone,
these cations tend to shield and stabilize the negatively charged
phosphate groups by forming weak ionic or electrostatic bonds. In
our experimental results, when a certain monovalent cation is present,
the DNA can be effectively neutralized or even converted from negative
to positive. This occurrence results in increased DNA adsorption onto
the negative surface (e.g., hydroxyl- and OVA-modified surfaces) and
decreased DNA adsorption onto the amino surface. Moreover, a small
amount of DNA adsorbs onto the amino surface in the presence of high
Na+ concentration. Meanwhile, the divalent electrolyte
can compensate for the large negative surface charge density of DNA.
Mg2+, which is usually associated with water molecules,
tend to link adjacent anions and generally neutralize the negatively
charged DNA surface by counterion condensation instead of binding
to specific sites.29 The dynamic nature
of counterion condensation results in the partial occupancy of specific
sites at regions of high electrostatic potential, with the level of
occupancy being a function of ionic strength. Divalent cations, however,
form both indirect and/or direct covalent bonds with either the negatively
charged DNA backbone or silanol groups present on the silica scaffold
surface.29 These points explain why the
divalent cations were more effective in driving DNA adsorption than
monovalent cations. The kinetics of DNA adsorption onto the amino
surface under Na+ and Mg2+ were similar. However,
the action of Mg2+ was not as effective as that of Na2+ on DNA adsorption onto the amino sensor surface. The part
of the DNA remained adsorbed onto the amino surface even at high Mg2+ concentration.

In summary, we presented a quantitative
study of ssDNA adsorption
onto various functional surfaces. We also discussed mechanism behind
this ssDNA adsorption in the presence of monovalent or divalent ions
and under various pH conditions. The mechanisms of ssDNA adsorption
onto solid surfaces were greatly dependent on the solid surface properties
and the solution characteristics (e.g., ionic strength and pH). The
DNA adsorption onto various functional surfaces can be perfectly fitted
by second-order Langmuir models, indicating that the process is a
single-molecular-layer adsorption. The results helped increase understanding
on the real-time processes involved in DNA adsorption onto silica
and can facilitate the future optimization of biosensors, DNA purification,
and genetic analysis and delivery.

Experiments
Chemicals and
Materials
OVA, APTS, glutaraldehyde,
and sodium dodecyl sulfate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). All other reagents, unless otherwise specified were purchased
from the Beijing Chemical Agents Co. Ltd. (Beijing, China).

The fluorescence-labeled high-performance liquid chromatography-grade
oligonucleotide was purchased from Sangon Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). The random sequence of DNA was: 5′-Cy5.5-AGTCA ACTTGA
AATGT CCGAT GCTC-3′. DNA oligonucleotide was dissolved in ultrapure
water (pH 7.0) and kept frozen at −20 °C for storage.

Surface Functionalization of Optic Fiber Probes
The
probes consist of a 5 cm length of 600 μm diameter, plastic-clad
step-index quartz optical fiber (Chunhui Science & Technology
Industrial Co., China) with cladding removed from 3.0 cm along the
distal end to form the sensing region (Figure S1). First, this region is tapered using immersion into hydrofluoric
acid based on tube etching.21 The length
of the tapered section and the sensing region are about 0.3 and 3.0
cm (Φ 225 μm), respectively. The etched optic fiber probe
was washed by ultrapure water and regarded as fiber A. Second, the
etched probe was placed in piranha solution (concentrated H2SO4/H2O2 2:1) to hydrolyze the probe
surface, which increased the silanol group concentration of the probe
surface. After acid treatment, the probe was rinsed with ultrapure
water and regarded as fiber B. Third, the hydroxyl probe was placed
in 2% APTS in toluene to obtain the amino surface for 1 h after drying
in N2. Excess APTS was eliminated with dry toluene to assure
the order and uniformity of the self-assembled monolayer.22 After washing by ultrapure water, the amino
probe was regarded as fiber C. Next, the amino probe was immersed
in a 5.0% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 1 h at 37 °C and
completely washed with ultrapure water. Finally, OVA was covalently
coupled to the probe surface through the optic fiber probe and was
immersed overnight in 2 mg/mL OVA in PBS solution (pH 7.4) at 4 °C,
which was regarded as fiber D after washing with ultrapure water.

Instrument: EWAB
The EWAB, which was previously developed
by our group, was applied to detect the real-time fluorescence signal
(Figure S1).21

Adsorption of ssDNA Detected by EWAB
In each sample
detection process, 300 μL of 20 nM Cy5.5-labeled ssDNA was delivered
into the sample cell by a peristaltic pump. The ssDNA adsorbed the
functional optic fiber probes for a certain time at room temperature,
and the fluorescence signal was detected in real time by EWAB.

To investigate effects of ionic species and strength, the DNA was
prepared using ultrapure water with various concentrations of NaCl
(0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 M) or MgCl2 (0, 1.0, 5.0,
10.0, 50.0, and 100.0 mM), respectively. To study the effect of pH,
the DNA solution was prepared using 0.01 M PBS with different pH (pH
= 1, 3, 5, 7, 9), which were adjusted by 1 M KOH or concentrated HCl.

Analysis of ssDNA Adsorption Kinetics Data
In theory,
each existing kinetic model representing adsorption kinetics at solid/liquid
interfaces yields a characteristic unique adsorption curve.23 However, various kinetic models are practically
difficult to test, and reliable kinetic parameters are challenging
to extract. Real-time data are needed over a wide range of surface
adsorption coverage and time scale. Despite the emergence of a number
of powerful surface analytical techniques, quantitation of absolute
surface adsorption coverage at solid/solution interfaces remains a
challenge. In this section, the resulting time-dependent surface coverage
Γ was compared with various Langmuir adsorption models as follows:

Langmuir adsorption 5  

Langmuir adsorption
with first-order desorption 6  

Second-order Langmuir adsorption 7  where C0 is the
ssDNA initial concentration, ka is the
adsorption constant, kd is the desorption
constant, and Γmax is the maximum surface coverage.
The Langmuir model assumes that all binding sites are equivalent and
already occupied sites do not influence the binding reaction in adjacent
places. The model also assumes that the surface is homogenously covered
by monolayers.24
