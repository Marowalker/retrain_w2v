The application of a domino radical bicyclization for
the synthesis
of compounds containing the 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane skeleton in 11–67%
yields as a mixture of diastereomers is described (trans configuration preference). This process involved formation and capture
of alkoxyaminyl radicals. For this purpose, O-benzyl
oxime ethers with a brominated or iodinated aromatic ring or a terminal
alkynyl group and an alkenyl moiety were employed as starting materials.
The bicyclization was initiated by 2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile
or triethylborane and promoted by Bu3SnH. The best results
were obtained with O-benzyl oxime ethers containing
an alkenyl moiety tethered to electron withdrawing groups or aryl
substituents, whereas oxime radical precursor attached to methyl-substituted
olefin precluded the capture of alkoxyaminyl radical, giving rise
mainly to monocyclized product.

Introduction
Cephalotaxine represents the parent polycyclic
core of a series
of Cephalotaxus alkaloids, which are characterized
for containing the 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane ring system. These alkaloids
exhibited potent antiproliferative activities against cancer cells.1a−1c Particularly, homoharringtonine, an ester derivative of cephalotaxine,
has been approved for treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia.1a,1b In fact, 1-azaspiro[4.4] nonane derivatives are present in several
compounds that exhibit marked biological activity, including inhibition
of hepatitis C virus1d and as agonists
of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR).1e,1f From an ionic reactions approach, countless synthetic strategies
have been described to build these spirane compounds, some of them
compiled in the review of Tietze et al.2 published in 2004. Others have been reported until the end of 2018;3 among these, only one research group reports
the construction of the aforementioned spirocycle in a single step,
using a tandem intramolecular hydroamination/semipinacol rearrangement.4 On the other hand, in the field of radicals chemistry,
there are only four synthetic methodologies reported in the literature:
Bowman et al.5 used a domino bicyclization
involving neutral aminyl radicals (Scheme 1), while Simpkins et al.,6 Renaud et al.,7a and Taniguchi
and Ishisbashi7b carried out a synthetic
route with alkyl radicals as intermediaries, starting from a pre-existing
ring.

Scheme 1 First Approach via Radicals toward the Construction of 1-Azaspiro[4.4]nonane
Derivatives
Our research group has been interested in the
development of C–N
bond-forming methodologies based on nitrogen-centered radical intermediaries
using domino strategies to obtain heterocyclic compounds with biological
potential. In that sense, we had previously reported a cascade radical
bicyclization process involving oxime ethers, where aryl radicals
were generated and immediately added onto a C=N bond in order
to produce neutral alkoxyaminyl8 or alkyl-oxyaminyl9 radicals, which were then subsequently captured
by a double bond activated with groups: Ph, CN, or CO2Me.
This process afforded heterocyclic compounds 5 exhibiting
a pyrrolidine nucleus fused to the indene skeleton (Scheme 2),9 whereas 1,5 hydrogen transfer and 6-exo-trig cyclization occurred to produce the side products 6 and 7.

Scheme 2 Domino Radical Bicyclization of Oxime
Ethers 4 To Produce
Heterotricyclic Fused Compounds 5 as Main Products
On the basis of our research work, Landais et
al.10 in 2008 attempted to obtain 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane
derivatives
through the sequential formation and capture of neutral alkoxyaminyl
radicals onto double bonds, but only monocyclized products were observed
because nitrogen-centered radical intermediates underwent a recombination
reaction with other carbon-centered radicals generated in the reaction
media.

In order to exploit the synthetic potential of this methodology
that allowed us to incorporate the nitrogen atom to fused ring systems
with biological potential and also to avoid the above-mentioned side
reactions, another class of precursors was designed. Thus, we preliminarily
synthesized the oxime ether 8 and when radical conditions
were applied, the spiro[indene-1,2′-pyrrolidine] 9 was obtained as a diastereomeric mixture (Scheme 3).11 In this case,
during the domino bicyclization process, two rings were formed, connected
by a single C atom (quaternary center) to generate the 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane
nucleus in a single stage reaction.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of the
1-Azaspiro[4.4]nonane Derivative 9 via
a Domino Radical Bicyclization
Therefore, on the basis of our previous research
work, and taking
into account that the synthetic potential of the alkoxyaminyl radicals
has been far less explored, herein, we present a new methodology for
the synthesis of 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane-based compounds 19 through a domino radical bicyclization from functionalized oxime
ethers involving the formation and capture of alkoxyaminyl radicals.

Results and Discussion
The radical precursors (oxime
ethers) were synthetized in a four-stage
route. Initially, the alkylation of methyl 3-oxobutanoate (methyl
acetoacetate) was carried out on its most basic carbon through a dianion
intermediate generating the β-ketoesters 11–15,12 which were alkylated on the activated
methylene. The carbomethoxy group (−CO2Me) of the
esters 16a–c was removed by dealkoxycarbonylation
using the Krapcho reaction.13 Whereas the
β-ketoesters 16d–j reacted under a novel
modification14 to the aforementioned reaction
affording ketones 17d–j (Table 1). Finally, the ester 16k was
dealkoxycarbonylated using the Curran method15 and lithium chloride (entry 11, Table 1). Then, the 17a–k compounds
were treated with O-benzyl hydroxylamine hydrochloride,
generating the corresponding O-benzyl oxime ethers 8 and 18a–j, as a mixture of geometric
isomers.

°C, SiO2/LiCl/DMF/MW or LiCl/H2O/DMF/MW
(c) BnONH3Cl/Py/CHCl3 or MeOH/reflux.

Subsequently, the oxime ethers with brominated aromatic
rings 18a–b (entries 1–3, Table 2) were subjected to radical
conditions under
inert atmosphere, with Bu3SnH/2,2′-azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) (Method A) in cyclohexane at reflux between 6 and 8 h. The
reaction proceeded affording the spirocycles 19a (66%)
and 19b (64%) as a pair of diastereomers, which were
isolated by column chromatography.

In contrast, for the precursor 18c bearing
the double
bond with two methyl groups (electron-releasing nature) (entry 3, Table 2), the reduction of
the intermediate alkoxyaminyl radical predominated affording the monocyclized
product 23c (50%) (Scheme 4), with respect to the spirane compound 19c (11%). This percentage was estimated by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) of the crude sample because it was not possible to carry out
an effective separation of the expected product. Such behavior demonstrates
one more time the nucleophilic nature of such radicals,9 and then attempting to increase the yield of
the desired compound 19c, MgBr2·Et2O was used in order to reverse the polarity of the alkoxyaminyl
radical and confer it electrophilicity via a complexation reaction
with the electron lone pair of the nitrogen atom.5 Nevertheless, the reaction did not proceed.

Scheme 4 Feasible
Stages for the Domino Radical Bicyclization of the Oxime
Ethers 18a–g
On the other hand, oxime ethers 8 and 18d,e containing an iodinated aromatic ring were
reacted via radicals
in cyclohexane, using AIBN at reflux (Method A) and BEt3 at room temperature (Method B), with reaction times decreased to
3 h and similar yields in both methods to afford the expected diastereomeric
mixture of spirocyclic products (entries 4, 5, 6, 8, Table 2). In all cases (of the double
cyclization by radicals) oxime ethers (10 y 20a–e) E and Z were obtained as minor
products (9–28%) due to the premature reduction of the aryl
radical with Bu3SnH (Table 2). It is remarkable that the diastereoselectivity of
this reaction increased when triethylborane (Et3B) was
used, especially in compound 19a bearing the substituent
carboethoxy (CO2Et). It is suggested that oxygen atoms
could act as Lewis bases forming a voluminous complex with boron and
generating greater steric hindrance, which prevents the formation
of the cis diastereomer.

The trans/cis configuration assignment
of spyrocyclic compounds was carried out on the basis of NOESY-2D
experiments, where the couplings of protons showed in Figure 1 allowed to assign the trans configuration of one of the diastereomers of 19b (Supporting Information). In
turn, one of the diastereomers 9 was characterized with
the trans configuration by X-ray diffraction.11

Figure 1 NOESY-2D couplings of the trans diastereomer 19b (one
enantiomer is shown).

The cis and trans diastereomers
displayed marked differences in the chemical shift of the CH at the pyrrolidinic ring and the OCH2Ph
group in the 1H NMR spectra. As a general rule, trans diastereomers showed these signals at lower field
compared to cis diastereomers. On the other hand,
diastereotopic methylene protons of the benzyloxy groups appeared
as two doublets, separated by approximately ∼0.06 and ∼0.38
ppm in the trans and cis diastereomers,
respectively. As shown in Table 2, the trans spiranes were always observed
as the major products.

In addition, the radical bicyclization
of precursor 18g showed complete diastereoselectivity
for the product, spyrocyclic 19e again in trans configuration (entry 7, Table 2), established by
the NOESY-1D experiment. Thus, when selective irradiation was applied
on Hβ proton, a spatial coupling with the protons
of the benzyloxy group was noticeable and by selectively irradiating
the hydrogens of that group, other coupling was observed with the
hydrogens of the cyclopentane (Figure 2 and the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 NOESY-1D couplings of protons of the trans diastereomer 19e (one enantiomer is shown).

Finally, the spirocycle trans-19d substituted with 4-ClC6H4 group
was isolated
at the lowest yield, although the 1H NMR spectrum of the
crude product showed significant presence of the expected compound
as a mixture of cis and trans diastereomers.
The above suggests a decomposition event during the purification process
by chromatography (entry 7, Table 2). With respect to precursor 18h containing
the aryl group substituted with a NO2 at position 4, the
domino cyclization reaction did not proceed.

Based on the above
results, as well as previous studies,9 we
reasoned a chain transfer radical for the
domino bicyclization reaction, where the halogen atom is abstracted
by tributylstannyl radicals from the oxime ethers 8 and 18a–h to afford aryl radicals 21. These
last underwent an intramolecular 5-exo-trig closure on the imino function to generate alkoxyaminyl radicals 22, which were captured intramolecularly by the double bond
of the alkenyl moiety to obtain the compounds 19 exhibiting
the azaspiro[4.4]nonane core (Scheme 4). Formation of side products 20 and in
one case, the monocyclized product 23c (Table 2), corroborates the mediation
of aryl and alkoxyaminyl radicals 21 and 22, respectively, in the domino radical bicyclization process.

As shown in Table 2, the domino radical bicyclization led to diastereomeric mixtures
of the spirocyclics 19a, b, e, and 9 with a predominance of the trans-stereoisomer. These results are in agreement with the “Beckwith–Houk ET model,”16 which predicts
that the major product arises when the substituent occupies an equatorial
position in the pseudo-chair conformation for cyclizations 5-exo of 2-substituted 5-hexenyl radicals to give predominantly trans-1,3-disubstituted cyclopentanes. Based on this model,
in Scheme 5A, equatorial
and axial pseudo-chair conformations of alkoxyaminyl radicals 22b allow to observe the preference of chair-equatorial conformation
before the second cyclization gives rise to trans diastereomer 19b.

Equatorial and Axial Pseudo-Chairs
for the Alkoxyaminyl Radicals 22b (A) and 22e (B), To Afford the Corresponding Diastereomeric Spirocyclics trans and cis-19b (A) and trans-19e (B) (One Enantiomer is Showed)
On the other hand, the bicyclization of compound 18g with two phenyl substituents at the end of the olefin
part gave
rise exclusively to trans stereoisomer 19e. In this case,
the pseudo-chair axial conformation is less stable than the pseudo-chair
equatorial. Additionally, the steric hindrance between the phenyl
groups and the indenic nucleus preclude the second cyclization. See Scheme 5B.

In addition,
considering the excellent reactivity of vinyl radicals
for addition onto the imine function in oxime ethers,17,18 two new precursors 18i,j (entries 9–10, Table 1) were designed including
an alkynyl moiety, instead of the 2-halophenyl groups. When the radical
conditions were applied to these precursors, only spirocyclic products 25i,j (Table 3) were obtained without evidence of reduction products. This behavior
either suggests that the rate of the first cyclization could be faster
in comparison with aryl radicals and/or that the stannylvinyls radicals
are reduced slower than the aryl radical intermediates.

2	Ph	Ph	25j (64)	100/0	25j (49)	100/0	
A hypothetical pathway could be described by the intermolecular
addition of tri-n-butylstannyl radicals on the triple
bond to afford stannylvinyl radicals 26i,j, which are
added to the oxime function via a 5-exo-trig closure, generating alkoxyaminyl radicals 27i,j. These,
in turn, are captured by the double bond of the alkenyl moiety in
another 5-exo-trig closure to obtain
stannylated spirocycles, 28i,j (Scheme 6).

Scheme 6 Suggested Mechanism for the Domino
Radical Bicyclization of the Oxime
Ethers, 18i,j
After removal of cyclohexane, a mixture of silica
gel/AcOH/DCM
was added to eliminate the tri-n-butylstannyl group
(dehydrostannylation), achieving the expected spirocyclic products 25i,j (Table 3). The diastereomeric pair configuration for the spirocycles 25i was assigned in the same way as it was done for compounds 19a, b , d, e (differentiation of doublets between methylenic
protons of the benzyloxy group: trans = 0.05 ppm
and cis = 0.2 ppm).

Domino radical bicyclization
reaction of O-benzyl
oxime ether 18i with AIBN in boiling cyclohexane proceeded
with no diastereoselectivity, probably due to the comparable stabilities
of both equatorial and axial pseudosilla conformations 27i, along with the absence of steric hindrance which makes the addition
of the alkoxyaminyl radical to the C=C bond in both conformations
difficult (Scheme 7). However, it is worth mentioning that these compounds showed a
predominance of the trans stereoisomer when Et3B was used as an initiator (Method B) at room temperature.

Scheme 7 Conformational Equilibrium of the Equatorial and Axial pseudo-chairs
for the Alkoxyaminyl Radical, 27i and Their Capture by
the Olefinic Appendix
Finally, the domino radical bicyclization from
oxime ether 18j resulted in a sole product, which was
assigned a trans configuration by comparison with
the cyclization of
the analogous oxime ether 18e [Scheme 5B].

Unfortunately, it was not possible
to differentiate the methylenic
hydrogens of the cyclopentane and those of the pyrrolidinic nucleus
to achieve a selective irradiation of protons in a NOESY experiment.
Here, the high diastereocontrol observed for the stannilated spirocyclic 28j (R1 = R2 = Ph) could be explained
as described for 28i (Scheme 7). With 28j the free movement
of the n-butyl groups around the tin atom in the
transition state would generate steric hindrance with any of the phenyl
groups linked to the double bond.

It is noteworthy that this
research work, focused on the construction
of 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane derivatives, constitutes the second documented
approach toward these target compounds via tandem radical bicyclization
with better yields than the pioneering work of Bowman et al.5 Besides, this is the third example in the literature
that considers the simultaneous formation of two rings, accounting
for both ionic and radical reactions. Another relevant aspect to point
out is that the use of Et3B as the radical initiator allowed
us to perform the synthesis under mild reaction conditions and improved
diasteroselectivity.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed
a synthetic methodology
to obtain 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane derivatives by a domino radical bicyclization
involving aryl/stannylvinyl and alkoxyaminyl radicals. The new spirocyclic
compounds 19 and 25 were synthesized in
moderate yields as a mixture of diastereomers (in most cases) with
predominance of trans configuration starting from O-benzyl oxime ethers containing a brominated or iodinated
aromatic ring or terminal alkynyl group and an alkenyl moiety. Two
radical initiators were used: AIBN at reflux and Et3B at
room temperature. Their comparison shows that the reaction times (3
h) with the Et3B initiator are shorter versus 6 h for reactions
with AIBN, while diastereoselectivity increases remarkably.

On the other hand, when aryl radicals were present, domino radical
bicyclization displayed side products due to their premature reduction.
In contrast, in those compounds exhibiting the terminal alkynyl group
and generating stannylvinyl radicals, no side products were observed.
Furthermore, O-benzyl oxime ethers with two phenyl
groups linked to the alkenyl moiety displayed complete diastereoselectivity
in the domino bicyclization process. Last, but not less important,
the obtained compounds with this synthetic methodology are alkoxyamines,
which could generate nitroxides (or aminoxyl radicals).23 Currently, our research group is making efforts
to optimize the design and synthesis of other structurally modified
alkoxyamines that can be used in nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
Melting points were determined in open
capillary tubes on Stuart SMP10. Reactions were monitored by thin
layer chromatography (TLC) on 0.2 mm silica gel F254 plates
(Merck); the spots were visualized under UV light (254 nm). Column
chromatography and flash column chromatography were conducted under
silica gel (Merck, 70–230 or 230–400 mesh). The chemical
structures of intermediate and final products were elucidated by nuclear
magnetic resonance spectra (1H NMR, 13C NMR)
which were determined on a Mercury 400 and 500 MHz, Gemini 300, VXR
300, and a Bruker AVANCE II 400 MHz spectrometer; 13C NMR
spectra are fully decoupled. The 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded in CDCl3 solution using a chloroform peak (7.24 ppm for 1H and
77.0 ppm for 13C) as a reference. Elemental analysis was
determined on a Thermo FlashEA 1112 series with a CHN analyzer, and
high resolution mass spectra (HRMS) was recorded on a Finnigan 4021
with GC coupled Kratos MS-80 and MS-50 using electronic impact, chemistry
ionization, or electrospray ionization (ESI). Reagents as potassium tert-butoxide, tri-n-nubutyltin hydride,
azobisisobutironitrile (AIBN), triethylborane (Et3B), 1-bromo-2-(bromomethyl)benzene,
1-iodo-2-methylbenzene, 3-bromoprop-1-yne, methyl acetoacetate, 4-iodobut-1-yne,
4-chlorobenzaldehyde, benzylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, cesium fluoride,
potassium fluoride, magnesium sulphate, lithium chloride, and the
solvents: dichlorometane (DCM), dimethylformamide (DMF), pyridine,
toluene, cyclohexane, methanol, chloroform, ethyl acetate, and so
forth, were purchased from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical
Co. or Alpha Aesar). The solvent tetrahydrofuran (THF) was distilled
under N2 from Na-benzophenone.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Spirocycles 19a–e; 9
Method (A): AIBN as initiator. A round
bottom flask was charged with the corresponding oxime ethers (1.0
mmol), tributyltin hydride (1.2 mmol), and AIBN (0.25 mmol) with cyclohexane
to reach a 0.02 M solution. The flask was stoppered with a rubber
septum, purged with N2 or Ar for 30 min, and the contents
were placed into a mineral oil bath heated at 90 °C. The reaction
mixture was stirred until the substrate was consumed (monitored by
TLC). Method (B): Triethylborane as initiator. A round bottom flask
was charged with the corresponding oxime ether (1.0 mmol), tributyltin
hydride (1.2 mmol), and triethylborane 1.0 M (2.5 mmol) in cyclohexane
to reach a 0.02 M solution. The flask was stoppered with a rubber
septum and the contents stirred at room temperature until the substrate
was consumed (monitored by TLC). After removal of cyclohexane, the
residue (in both methods) was dissolved in ethyl acetate (∼3
mL), mixed with ∼2 mL of an aqueous solution of KF or CsF (10%),
and stirred overnight. The white solid was filtered, the liquid phase
extracted with ethyl acetate, and the combined organic extracts dried
with anhydrous magnesium sulphate. Finally, the solvent was removed
under reduced pressure and the crude product filtered on a short column
charged with a silica gel 70–230 mesh and eluted initially
with hexane, then with a solution of toluene/hexane (15%) to remove
organotin impurities. After evaporation of the solvent, this crude
prepurified was passed over flash column chromatography filled with
a silica gel 230–400 mesh or preparative plate to obtain the
corresponding spirocyclic compounds 19 and the byproducts 20.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Spirocycles 25
Conditions described earlier as Methods (A) and (B) were
also used for this case. But after removal of cyclohexane, dehydrostannylation
was carried out; ∼14 mL of dichloromethane, ∼2.5 g of
silica gel 70–230 mesh, and ∼5 drops of acetic acid
were added, the mixture was stirred for 12 h, filtered, washed with
chloroform, and finally concentrated under reduced pressure. Finally,
the solvent was removed and the crude product filtered on a short
column charged with a silica gel 70–230 mesh and eluted initially
with hexane, then with a solution of toluene/hexane (15%) to remove
organotin impurities. After evaporation of the solvent, this crude
prepurified was passed over flash column chromatography filled with
a silica gel 230–400 mesh to obtain the corresponding spirocyclic
compounds 25.
