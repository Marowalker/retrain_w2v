Two-dimensional boron
(borophene) is a promising, newly synthesized
monolayer metal with promising electronic and optical properties.
Borophene has only been recently synthesized on silver substrates,
and displays a variety of crystal structures and substrate-induced
strains depending on the growth conditions and surface orientation.
Here, we present an extensive first-principles study of the structural
and optoelectronic properties of the two proposed structures of borophene,
β12 and δ6, under strain. With a
density functional theory analysis, we determine that the optical
absorbance and electronic band structure are continuously tunable
upon application of few percent of strain. Although both structures
remain metallic with moderate strains of up to 6% applied, key features
of the band structure, as well as the inplane anisotropy of the complex
dielectric function and optical absorption, can be significantly modified.

I Introduction
Nanoscale
conductors such as graphene and carbon nanotubes are
the key functional elements in several next-generation nanotechnologies.
In particular, ultrathin carbon-based films have been recently utilized
in next-generation touchscreen technologies,1,2 flexible
electronics,3 transparent conductive electrodes
in solar cells,4−6 and low-power electronics.7,8 These
materials have low production costs and scalable processing methods;
however, in sub-10 nm devices, with atomically controlled interfaces,
it is particularly desirable to have a defect-free atomically thin
monolayer that can serve as an electrode. Although exfoliated graphene
is highly promising for this application, there are remaining challenges
for large-scale production. Chemical vapor deposition-grown graphene
samples have micron-sized grains9 and reduced
graphene oxide has residual defects,10,11 which degrade
the conductivity of the sheet. As an alternative, two-dimensional
(2D) boron or borophene is a recently proposed monolayer material
that has been predicted to display metallic properties,12−15 and form Ohmic contacts to 2D semiconductors, greatly enhancing
the performance of electronic devices.16

Borophene has only been recently synthesized on silver substrates,17−20 with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images providing evidence
of the 2D nature of the films, though the crystal structure is still
undetermined due the many possible low-energy structures. Boron exists
in numerous allotropes: there are four bulk boron structures,21 and as the dimensions are reduced to two,12,14,15,22−30 one,14,31−35 or zero,36−40 multiple low-energy structures have been observed and predicted.
To date, the true ground state structure of the monolayer is not known.22,25,27,41−44 It is predicted that planar boron sheets form a triangular bonding
configuration, which is unstable due to an excess of electrons that
occupy the antibonding orbitals;12,13 this structure
can be stabilized by the introduction of vacancies, an example of
which is shown for the β12 structure in Figure 1a, or out-of-plane
buckling as shown for the δ6 structure in Figure 1b. Additionally,
when borophene is grown on the substrates, the lattice mismatch between
the substrate lattice constant and the periodicity of the boron sheet,
as well as charge transfer between boron and substrate, favor the
certain atomic configurations of boron atoms (boron allotropes) and
rotation angles between boron and substrate (Moire patterns). There
are several experimentally observed structures for borophene grown
on Ag(111) based on scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements
and calculations. The δ6 structure, a hexagonal lattice
with out-of-plane rumpling of the central atom, was initially proposed
as being consistent with the STM measurements.17 The β12 structure, with one out of six
boron atoms replaced by a vacancy, is expected to be the most abundantly
grown on Ag(111) substrate,18,20,45 whereas at a higher growth temperatures, there is evidence for the
χ3 structure,20 which
has one out of five atoms missing and also forms a network of connected
vacancies. Another structure, labeled α-boron (one out of nine
boron atoms missing),13 was predicted to
be the lowest-energy structure in two dimensions, but has been experimentally
observed as only a minor phase on Ag(111) substrates.20 Additionally, recent studies of borophene synthesized on
Ag(110) substrates have demonstrated several new allotropes of borophene
in striped phase, with varying widths of stripes.19

Figure 1 Atomic structure of the (a) β12 and (b) δ6 borophene allotropes. The unit cell for each is shown by
an orange box. The β12 and δ6 phases
have five and two boron atoms per unit cell, respectively, with the
δ6 phase displaying an out-of-plane rippling of 0.88
Å, as shown at the bottom of (b).

To date, freestanding borophene has not yet been isolated
and the
optoelectronic properties of the monolayer have not yet been measured.
The impact of Ag(111) substrate on the electronic structure of borophene
is more complex than in the case of graphene;46 however, experimental measurements have confirmed the metallic character
of borophene adsorbed on silver substrates.17,47 Numerous ab initio calculations of freestanding borophene allotropes
predict 2D metals with a rich set of electronic properties. Density
functional theory (DFT) simulations, in particular, have demonstrated
very different electronic band structures of the different borophene
allotropes.12−14,22,44,48−52 Although all of the 2D allotropes are metallic, the
band structure near the Fermi energy can take either a quadratic form
as a traditional metal (e.g., for δ6 sheets), or
display both quadratic and crossing linear bands, resulting in Dirac
points (e.g., β12 and χ3). The Dirac
point is above the Fermi level in β12 sheet and below
the Fermi level in χ3 sheet.52 Additionally, phonon-mediated superconductivity53−58 and low thermal conductivity59 have been
predicted for certain allotropes. Such diverse electronic properties
of borophene allotropes, as well as their light weight, metallicity,
and mechanical stability, suggest that it is a promising material
for future applications as a monolayer conductor, a high-capacity
electrode for electrochemical applications,60−65 and a catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction.66,67

This variety of experimentally synthesized borophene allotropes
realized by change in substrate, the substrate crystallographic orientation,
and growth conditions results in a diverse class of 2D metals. Additionally,
small strains, induced by the adjustment of borophene to the substrate,
can be utilized to tune the properties of borophene. Strain engineering
has been extensively investigated for other 2D material systems such
as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. As an example, homogeneous
strain in graphene enhances the electron–phonon coupling68 and nonuniform strain generates extremely high
pseudomagnetic fields.69,70 In monolayer molybdenum disulfide,
small compressive (tensile) strains enhance (decrease) the fluorescence
intensity,71,72 and 10% tensile strain induces
a semiconductor-to-metal transition.71 Similar
to that of these materials, mechanical strength of borophene is outstanding
and the monolayer is expected to withstand high strains without the
reduction in structural integrity.52,73−79 However, a systematic study of strain engineering in this system
has not been performed previously.

Here, we utilize the first-principle
density functional theory
(DFT) to understand the inplane strain dependence of electronic and
optical properties of two possible boron allotropes shown in Figure 1. We demonstrate
that strain engineering in borophene allows for a continuous tuning
of electronic and optical properties without the structural disintegration.
We predict that both borophene structures are resilient to compressive
and tensile strains up to 6%, with deformation energies of less than
100 meV; and that their band structures can be significantly modified
at these strains while retaining their metallic nature. Moreover,
we show that both boron allotropes are weakly absorbing, with an anisotropy
in the dielectric response to X- and Y-polarized light. Our study demonstrates that strain enhances the
functionality of this promising 2D conductor via tuning of electronic
and optical properties.

II Results
II.I Structural
Properties
We study the
strain within two crystal structures of borophene, β12 and δ6, as depicted in Figure 1. These structures have been predicted as
candidates for borophene grown on Ag(111) based on the symmetry of
scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images. Although the β12 structure has been theoretically predicted to be the most
favorable geometry on noble metal substrates,80 the δ6 structure is close in energy22 and its 1 × 3 supercell displays a close
lattice match to Ag(111) 1 × √3 supercell. Here, we predict
that the formation energy of the β12 structure on
Ag(111) is 0.155 eV more favorable than that of the δ6 structure, in agreement with previous DFT-based predictions.80

Figure 2 illustrates the change in total energy of borophene
as a function of strain along the x- and y-axes, εx,y, with 1% strain increments. The application of strain results
in an energy penalty due to deformation (deformation energy) that
we separate in three regimes—weak, moderate, or strong—based
on the magnitude. We classify the deformation as weak if the energy
penalty is below 50 meV/atom; moderate if the energy penalty is between
50 and 100 meV per boron atom; and strong if the deformation energies
are greater than 100 meV/atom.

Figure 2 Deformation energy per atom (eV) as a
function of strain εx,y in the (a) β12 and (b) δ6 borophene allotropes. One pixel
corresponds to a 1% increment in value of strain, and white circles
mark the values of strain in 3% increments that were studied in more
detail.

The β12 structure
(Figure 1a) contains
five atoms per unit cell with
alternating rows of empty and filled hexagons along the x-direction (forming stripes of vacancies along x-direction) and columns of continuous line of atoms alternating with
incomplete hexagons along the y-direction. Evaluation
of the computed charge density indicates that the boron atoms are
sp-bonded with delocalized charge density along x-direction and a slightly weaker delocalization along y-direction due to the different bond lengths in each direction (see
the Supporting Information Figures S1 and S2). Because the sp-type bonding in this structure is highly sensitive
to the atomic orbital overlap, the density localizes upon bond stretching
(for tensile strain) and results in a less free-electron-like system
for states near the Fermi energy. Similarly, compressive strains result
in stronger density delocalization.

The deformation energy upon
application of strain, shown in Figure 2a, does not reflect
this anisotropy; the deformation energy has a relatively uniform behavior
along the x- and y-directions. Here,
small (1–2%) tensile or compressive strain results in a small
energy penalty of about kBT (25 meV/atom); therefore, this material may easily slightly adjust
its lattice constant to that of the underlying substrate. This weak
deformation lasts up to strains of (εx, εy) = (±3, ±3)%,
with an energy penalty of about 50 meV/atom. Uniaxial strains of (±6,
0)% and (0, ±6)% result in moderate deformations of about 100
meV/atom, whereas biaxial (6, 6)% tensile and (−6, −6)%
compressive strains result in greater than 150 meV/atom energy penalty,
indicating a strong deformation. Beyond this region, the deformation
energies are greater than 150 meV/atom.

By contrast, the δ6 structure, shown in Figure 1b, contains two atoms
in the hexagonal unit cell, with an out-of-plane rumpling of the central
atom and no vacancy or stripe formation. Along the x-direction, the structure contains zigzag rows with boron atoms of
alternating heights, whereas along the y-direction,
there are continuous columns of atoms. Here, an analysis of the computed
charge density suggests that the atoms bond via π-bonding of
pz orbitals. Due to the zigzag structure
along the x-direction, the pz orbital bonding is significantly weaker along this direction than
along the y-direction, as can be seen in the charge
density distribution for states near the Fermi energy (see Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

This anisotropy is reflected in the deformation energies shown
in Figure 2b: the δ6 allotrope is soft toward deformations along the x-axis, as is expected based on the periodically buckled atomic configuration,
and more difficult to deform along the y-axis. For
example, with 10% strain, the deformation energy is ∼100 meV/atom
for both tensile and compressive strains along x-axis
and 200 and 500 meV/atom for tensile and compressive strains along y-axis, respectively. Such large differences in the compression
energies are to be expected because compression along the y-axis changes the bond lengths significantly. We predict
that ±3% strain results in a weak deformation and ±6% strain
along the x-axis and y-axis results
in moderate and strong deformations, respectively.

Figure 2 indicates
that ±3% (weak) and ±6% (moderate) strain, with few exceptions,
do not result in a large deformation energy, and thus will not compromise
the structural integrity of the boron monolayers. Therefore, we focus
on strains up to ±6% for further analysis. White circles in Figure 2 mark the values
of strains for which we simulate the electronic and optical properties.

II.II Optoelectronic Properties of Unstrained
Borophene
Figure 3 shows the calculated band structure for both unstrained structures.
We predict that both allotropes are metals with several bands crossing
the Fermi energy (EF), in agreement with
previous calculations.17,18,52,53,81,47 The β12 allotrope contains three
bands near the top of the valence band (Figure 3a) and a Dirac cone, i.e., linearly crossing
bands, located near the S-point at about 0.5 eV above EF.47 The δ6 allotrope shows a different character to the band structure,
with two partially occupied bands, which cross EF, as shown in Figure 3b. In the vicinity of the Γ-point (k = 0), there is a 4.1 eV gap in the band structure. Our calculations
for the band structure of both borophene allotropes are in agreement
published works that used similar DFT methodology.17,18,52,53,81,47 However, the discrepancy
between our calculations and those presented by Peng et al. (ref (51)) is likely due to the
use of different DFT functionals (HSE0682 versus Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)83).

Figure 3 Calculated band structure, absorbance, and the real (ϵ1) and imaginary (ϵ2) components of dielectric
function for unstrained β12 (a) and δ6 (b). For the band structure, the plots are shifted such that the
Fermi energy (dotted line) is at zero. For the lower panels, the response
to X, Y, and Z polarized
light are depicted in black, red, and blue, respectively.

The optical properties of the two boron allotropes
are presented
in the lower panels of Figure 3. Here, we consider only the interband transitions for optical
absorption and ignore the intraband transitions that would result
in modification of the spectrum at very low energies (<0.1 eV).
The real (ϵ1(ω)) and imaginary (ϵ2(ω)) components of the dielectric function display anisotropy
in response to light polarized along the x- and y-axes for both β12 and δ6 allotropes. We quantify this anisotropy by the calculated bulk plasma
frequency (ωp) in each direction (Table 1). ϵ1, a measure
of the strength of the dynamical screening effects arising from charge
excitations, shows a strong response at ωp, which
is predicted to be 2.9 eV (2.4 eV) and 2.1 eV (4.4 eV) for X- (Y-) polarized light within the β12 and δ6 allotropes, respectively. We note
here that the 2D surface plasmon will have a much smaller value than
ωp in Table 1; considering a free electron gas in 2D, the plasma frequency , where L is the length
of the unit cell and q is the wavevector of light.84 Considering the visible range of light, ωp2D is 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than
ωp. Interestingly, a recent study85 of 8̅Pmmn borophene, a structure
somewhat similar to δ6, has suggested that the anisotropy
in the plasma frequency of borophene may be used for plasma-wave nanodevices.86 As we will show in Section II.IV, strain enhances anisotropy and therefore
makes this application more feasible.

ϵ2, a measure of light absorption as a consequence
of neutral and plasmonic charge excitations, also shows a polarization
dependence. For the β12 allotrope, ϵ2(ω) shows an onset of ∼0.2 eV and contains a pronounced
peak at ω ∼ 0.8 eV for X-polarized light,
whereas for Y-polarized light, ϵ2(ω) slowly rises at 1 eV. For the δ6 allotrope,
ϵ2(ω) rises from 0 at 2.5 eV due to excitations
from the middle of Γ–Y and Γ–S regions of the Brillouin zone and increases in strength
at 4 eV due to the addition of excitations at the gap at Γ.
For Y-polarized light, the onset of ϵ2 is at 4.0 eV, with a negligibly small strength up to 6.8 eV. The Z-component of the imaginary part of the dielectric functions
of both boron structures is very small, as expected for a 2D material.

The onset of absorption corresponds to the onset of ϵ2(ω) and is negligible (<0.2 eV) for β12 (Figure 3a) and 3.0
eV for δ6 (Figure 3b), consistent with the lowest direct transition energies
in the band structure. Both allotropes are predicted to be weakly
absorbing: in the visible range, the absorbance is under 1%. For comparison,
within the same region of light, graphene absorbs 2.3%.87 We note that Peng et al.51 predicted a different absorption spectrum, which can again
be attributed to the use of different functionals.

II.III Band structure of Strained Borophene
II.III.I Strained β12 Borophene
Figure 4 plots the
band structure of the strained β12 allotrope, shown
for ±6% strains to highlight the most important trends, which
are observed to a lesser degree with ±3% strains. The most relevant
features are highlighted in red circles (the Dirac point near S) and green ovals (the valence bands in the vicinity of
the Γ-point). In general, strain along the x-axis does not significantly alter the former but does strongly influence
the latter, whereas strain along the y-axis strongly
influences both.

Figure 4 Band structure of β12 borophene at selected
values
of strain. Red circles highlight the changes in the position of the
Dirac point and green ovals accentuate the alteration of band structure
in the vicinity of the Γ-point.

Strain along y-axis results in shifting
of the
Dirac point closer to EF for compressive
and farther away from EF for tensile strains.
This trend is most apparent when starting from an x-strained structure (panel (6, 0)) and straining along y-axis. Upon stretching by 6% along y-axis (panel
(6, 6)), the Dirac point decreases to 0.1 eV above EF, whereas 6% compression along y-axis
(panel (6, −6)) results in the Dirac point increasing to 0.9
eV above EF. This suggests that tensile
strength can lead to the presence of massless fermions at EF as exist in graphene, though in this case
there are parabolic bands resulting in massive electrons present at EF as well.

The gap near Γ is influenced
by both x-
and y-strain, with a greater influence of x-strain. The gap can open up from 0.1 eV with no strain
to 0.8 eV with 6% tensile strain along x-direction.
As discussed in the next section, the value of this gap influences
the nature and energy of the optical absorption onset. Additionally,
the influence of strain along x- and y-axes is to some extent coupled, as both strain directions affect
the highlighted electronic bands to some degree. Six percent homogeneous
tensile strain shifts the Dirac point to 0.1 eV above EF and opens a 1 eV band gap at Γ, whereas 6% compressive
strain shifts the Dirac point to about 0.3 eV above EF and results in closing of the band gap in the vicinity
of EF near Γ.

II.III.II Strained δ6 Borophene
For the strained
δ6 allotrope, the two most relevant
features are highlighted in Figure 5 by the blue arrow (gap at Γ) and red circle
(unoccupied bands above the Fermi energy along Y–Γ
line). As discussed in the next section, these bands contribute to
optical absorption in the visible range. In general, the band gap
at Γ is increased with compressive and decreased with tensile
strains. Due to the anisotropic nature of the structure, there is
anisotropy in this effect. Notably, a few percent deformation along
the x-axis induces changes in the gap by up to 2
eV for 6% strain ((±6, 0)), whereas strain along y-axis does not appreciably modify the gap (by about 0.5 eV in (0,
±6)). Based on the small deformation energies for strain along x-axis, the strong response of the gap to strain in this
direction may be unexpected, but can be explained based on its π-bonded
nature and zigzag structure along x-axis. The pz orbitals are either pushed more out-of-plane
with those of the neighboring atoms as borophene becomes more buckled
under compression or pushed inplane upon tensile x-directed strain resulting in stronger interactions among the nearest
neighbors.

Figure 5 Band structure of δ6 borophene at selected values
of strain. Red circles and blue arrows highlight the important changes
in the band structure along Γ–Y and
at the Γ-point, respectively.

The unoccupied bands along the Y–Γ
line are strongly responsive to strain along both x- and y-directions. The shape of the bands, as well
as their position with respect to EF,
changes with strain. For example, a 6% isotropic stretch ((6, 6) panel)
moves these bands by ∼1.5 eV down toward EF, whereas a 6% isotropic compression ((−6, −6)
panel) pushes these bands up by ∼2 eV away from EF. As these bands are lowered in energy below the gap
at Γ, they begin to dominate optical absorption at low energies.

This analysis of the band structure indicates that both borophene
allotropes remain metallic under weak and moderate strains. The strain-related
changes in band shape, as well as band position with respect to the
Fermi energy, will affect the conductivity of the monolayer metal,
and will also affect the energies and intensities of optical transitions,
as described in the next Section II.IV.

II.IV Optical Properties of
Strained Borophene
With the application of strain, the weak
absorbance and anisotropy
of response to X-/Y-light polarization
described in Section II.III are maintained. However, there are two features that can
be manipulated by strain: (i) the anisotropy in response to X- and Y-polarized light; and (ii) the
onset of optical absorption. As explained below, these strain-dependent
trends can be related to changes in the band structure and the charge
density delocalization.

II.IV.I Strained β12 Borophene
The application of strain allows the
tuning of both the real component
of the dielectric function, as demonstrated by the change in calculated
ωp shown in Table 1. For X-polarized light, the ωp ranges from 2.15 to 3.71 eV, whereas for Y-polarized light, it can vary from 0.64 to 3.44 eV. Importantly,
the X-/Y-anisotropy in response
can be tuned via strain as demonstrated from the change in ωp (Table S3). This value is 1 eV
for the unstrained structure. The application of tensile strain along x-axis increases the anisotropy, whereas compressive strain
decreases it. Conversely, the application of tensile strain along y-axis decreases anisotropy, whereas the compressive strain
decreases it. Homogeneous strain, either compressive or tensile, decreases
anisotropy. These trends can be understood as due to change in anisotropy
of the atomic structure; for example, with homogeneous tensile strain,
the bond lengths shift such that the bond length connecting the hexagonal
rows is closer to the length of the hexagon edges, resulting in a
more isotropic charge density for states near the Fermi energy (see
calculated local density of states (LDOS’s) in Figures S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information).

For this structure, the application of a few percent strain does
not result in a significant shift in the onset of absorption (which
is close to zero) or change in absorption strength (<1% absorptivity
in the UV–vis region), as shown in Figure S5a. It does, however, influence the strength of the imaginary
part of dielectric function ϵ2 for X-polarized light. For example, the peak at 0.8 eV (Figure 6) is enhanced for tensile strain
along the y-axis and compressive strain along the x-axis. The enhanced ϵ2 correlates with
decreased delocalization of the electron density along the y-axis (see Figure S1). For the
same reason, homogeneous strain, both compressive and tensile, results
in decrease in the ϵ2 peak intensity and suppresses X/Y anisotropy (see Tables 1 and S3 and Figure 6a).

Figure 6 Imaginary component of
the dielectric function ϵ2 for strained (a) β12 and (b) δ6 borophene. The response to X-, Y-, and Z-polarized
light are depicted in black,
red, and blue, respectively.

II.IV.II Strained δ6 Borophene
Analogous to the β12, ωp for
the δ6 allotrope can vary by a few electron volts
with applied strain (0.85–3.4 eV for X-polarized
light and 2.4–6.7 eV for Y-polarized light),
and strains significantly alter the X-/Y-anisotropy, as shown in Tables 2 and S3. The trend in strain-dependent X-/Y-anisotropy is not as clear for this
structure because of the larger deformation energy at high (6%) strain
and because of the nonplanar atomic structure. In general, compressive
(tensile) strains along y-axis increase (decrease)
anisotropy, which can be explained as due to the decreased (increased)
bond lengths and, therefore, increased (decreased) delocalization
along y-axis. For strains along x-axis, there is a competition between change in buckling, which leads
to increased delocalization as the buckling is reduced and the sheet
becomes more planar (for tensile strain), and change in bond lengths,
which separates pz orbitals and reduces
delocalization. This is shown in the evolution of the charge density
for states near EF in Figures S3 and S4. As shown in Table S3, the anisotropy can be minimized with a strain of (−6, 3)
to 0.5 eV difference or maximized at a strain of (−3, −6)
to 4.4 eV.

The imaginary component of the dielectric function ϵ2 in δ6 borophene displays a weaker response
to strain than in β12. The application of strain
does however strongly influence the onset of the rise in ϵ2 and, therefore, absorption (shown in Figure S5b). This strain dependence is to be expected based
on the changes in the gap at Γ and the position of the lowest
energy of fully unoccupied band in the band structure, as shown in Figure 5. We predict that
compressive strains along x, y,
or xy (homogeneous strain) directions increase the
onset of absorption, whereas tensile strains in the same directions
decrease it. For the unstrained structure (0, 0), the onset of absorption
is at 2.5 and 4.0 eV and the absorption peak is at 3.5 and 6.8 eV,
for X- and Y-polarized light, respectively.
The most dramatic shift in the onset is seen with the application
of homogeneous strain 6% strain; tensile strain (panel (6, 6)) reduces
the onsets of absorption to 1 and 3 eV (2 and 5 eV peak), whereas
compression (panel (−6, −6)) increases the onsets to
3 and 4.5 eV (4 and 8 eV peak) for X- and Y-light polarizations, respectively.

Interestingly,
at a value of strain of (−3, 6)%, there is
a qualitatively different behavior of ϵ2 and absorbance
(Figures 6b and S5b, respectively), which can be related to the
charge density. The local density of states shows a weak overlap of
pz orbitals along the y-axis and consequently stronger bonding along the x-axis, whereas the density of states in the vicinity of EF is larger than that in the unstrained case, as shown
in Figures S4 and S6. This results in larger
number of states available for excitations in the vicinity of Fermi
energy, therefore enhancing ϵ2 at low energies. This
demonstrates the sensitivity of absorption strength to modifications
in charge density.

III Conclusions
In
summary, we have investigated the electronic and optical properties
of two proposed allotropes of freestanding monolayer boron (borophene)
upon application of tensile and compressive strains to simulate the
influence of its underlying substrate and assess the tunability of
its optoelectronic properties. We predict that the application of
few percent strain changes the total energy by <50 meV/atom, which
we expect will not compromise its structural integrity. Our DFT-based
calculations reveal that although borophene remains metallic under
up to 6% strain, the features of the band structure can be significantly
modified, and that the optical properties of borophene strongly respond
to small strains, a feature that is correlated with enhancement of
or decrease in charge delocalization along different crystallographic
directions by the modification of bond lengths. Additionally, we demonstrate
that the response of borophene to light is highly dependent on the
polarization direction of incoming light, an anisotropy that can be
tuned via strain. The ability to tune this anisotropy may be utilized
in optoelectronic applications such as plasma-wave nanodetectors.88 This study demonstrates that strain can be utilized
to tune the optoelectronic properties of borophene, increasing the
applicability of borophene in 2D device architectures.

IV Methods
DFT and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations
on the strained
β12 and δ6 borophene structures
were performed to simulate the electronic and optical properties of
borophene, respectively. We utilized Quantum Espresso simulation suite,89 with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) approximation83 and Troullier–Martins90 norm-conserving pseudopotentials to describe
the core and nuclei of boron. To account for the aperiodicity of the
isolated monolayer, we include 12 Å of vacuum between periodic
images along the direction perpendicular to borophene. Convergence
of the total energy was found to be better than 1 meV/atom for a plane
wave cutoff 100 Ry and k-point mesh of 36 ×
20 × 1 and 36 × 60 × 1 for the β12 and δ6 structures, respectively, which corresponds
to a k-point density of 2π × 0.01 Å–1.

The structure of the β12 and
δ6 unit cells was optimized within the periodic directions
(xy-plane) to the accuracy of 0.01 meV/atom in energy
and
1 meV/Å in force tolerance. The optimized unit cells were determined
to be (a0, b0) = (2.936 Å, 5.087 Å), where a and b are the lattice vectors in x- and y-directions, respectively, for the β12 structure and (a0, b0) = (2.892 Å, 1.615 Å) for the δ6 structure. Strained unit cells were constructed with 1% strain
increments, with atomic positions reoptimized. We label strain in x- and y-directions using such notations: , with a negative strain indicating a compression
and a positive indicating a tensile. The values of these lattice constants
are given in Supporting Table S1. The deformation
energy was computed with ±1% strain increments as Edef(εx, εy) = Etot(εx, εy) – Etot(0, 0). Figure 2 shows a heat map of the deformation energies
for 440 values of strain for each boron allotrope.

A detailed
analysis of the electronic structure of strained borophene
was performed for ±3 and ±6% of strain. For band structure
calculations, the coordinate of high-symmetry points in (kx, ky) space were as follows:
Γ = (0.0, 0.0), X = (π/a, 0.0), Y = (0.0, π/b), S = (π/a, π/b). The density of k-points along chosen high-symmetry
directions was 2π × 0.005 Å–1. The
work function for each strained structure is shown in Table S2. In a separate study,91 we have carefully analyzed the optoelectronic properties
of unstrained freestanding β12 and δ6 borophene and the accuracy of DFT within the local density approximation
(LDA) for describing these properties. We found, by comparison to
many-body perturbation theory calculations within the G0W0/Bethe–Salpeter equation approximation, that
DFT-LDA and RPA can accurately describe the band structure and optical
absorption properties of borophene, respectively. These studies predict
that the many-body interactions are negligible, possibly due to the
free-electron-like nature of electrons in this system. Accordingly,
we expect that accounting for many-body interactions will not qualitatively
change our conclusions on strain dependence of optoelectronic properties
of borophene.

We employ the RPA to calculate the complex dielectric
function
ϵ1 + iϵ2 of strained boron allotropes.
Intraband transitions are neglected in this work. We compute the optical
absorbance92 as  for 25 strained geometries ranging from
−6 to 6% strain. Here, L is the thickness
of the simulation cell in the z-direction, i.e.,
perpendicular to borophene, ω is the energy of light, and c is the speed of light. To simulate the broadening of the
dielectric function due to finite temperature, we used a Gaussian
smearing of width 0.2 eV. For the 25 strained structures, the k-point mesh was kept at 36 × 20 × 1 and 36 ×
60 × 1 for the β12 and δ6 boron
allotropes, respectively. Although this k-point mesh
is sufficient for capturing strain-dependent trends in optoelectronic
properties, a higher-density k-point mesh of 180
× 100 × 1 and 180 × 300 × 1 for β12 and δ6 systems, respectively, was required to eliminate
noise. Due to the high computational cost, we only used this dense k-point mesh to study the unstrained structures, with the
results shown in Figure 3. Strain-dependent changes in ϵ2 and absorbance
are shown in Figures 6 and S5. Within the Quantum Espresso package,89 the bulk plasma frequency is evaluated as an
integral , where α and β indicate the
directions x, y, or z. At this resonance frequency, the electron loss function, which
is proportional to ϵ22/(ϵ12 + ϵ22), is maximized. The computed plasma frequencies
for strained borophene are summarized in Tables 1 and 2.

To better
understand the enhanced anisotropy of ϵ2 in selected
strained geometries of β12 borophene,
we calculated the local density of states (LDOS’s) near the
Fermi energy by summing the square of the wave functions for all of
the states with eigenvalues between energies (EF, EF + 100 meV) and (EF – 100 meV, EF) for
all k-points. The results are plotted in Figure S1. The slices of LDOS at 0.8 Å above
the atomic plane are shown in Figure S2. LDOS plots for selected values of strain in δ6 borophene are shown in Figures S3 and S4.
