Post-translational
modification of substrate proteins plays crucial
roles in the regulation of their activity, cellular localization,
and ability to be recognized by other proteins. One of those modifications
involves the installment of adenosine-diphosphate-ribose (ADPr) onto
nucleophilic side-chain groups of amino acid residues. This highly
dynamic process is regulated by ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTs) that
install the ADPr-molecules on selected proteins and poly(ADP-ribosyl)
glycohydrolases (PARGs) and (ADP-ribosyl)hydrolases (ARHs) that trim
down and remove ADPr-chains. In this mini-review, the most recent
advances in the chemical synthesis of ADPr-conjugates, poly-ADP-ribose,
ADPr-peptides, and -proteins, and other tools to investigate ADPr-biology
are discussed.

1 Introduction
Among the spectrum of post-translational modifications (PTMs),
the attachment of adenosine-diphosphate-ribose (ADPr) to protein substrates
in either its monomeric form, mono-ADP-ribose (MAR), or polymeric
form, poly-ADP-ribose (PAR), has gained relatively little attention
when compared to, e.g., phosphorylation or glycosylation events. ADP-ribosylation
plays crucial roles in DNA-repair pathways and maintenance of genomic
stability but is also implicated in cell differentiation, immunity,
transcription regulation, and stress responses.1

The field of ADPr-research has grown over the past
two decades
due to, among others, the evolvement of highly sensitive mass spectrometric
techniques and sophisticated chemical methodologies. The identification
of ADP-ribosylation sites on protein substrates and enzymes involved
in installing and removing this PTM has led to new insights into biochemical
pathways that ADP-ribosylation is involved in. The FDA approval of olaparib, the first poly-ADPr-polymerase inhibitor in the
treatment of BRCA1/2-mutated ovarian cancers, highlights the importance
of gaining an understanding of this dynamic modification and the enzymes
involved.

The enzymes that catalyze the transfer of ADPr from
nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to a nucleophilic amino acid
side-chain functionality, while expelling nicotinamide, are collectively
classified as ADP-ribosyl transferases (ARTs) (see Figure 1).2,3 ARTs
can be
clustered into two distinct groups based on their active site architecture.
The first group is known as ADP-ribosyltransferase diphteria-toxin
like (ARTD), sharing a similar active site histidine-tyrosine-glutamate
(HYE) motif as their bacterial ancestor diphteria toxin. The second
group is known as ADP-ribosyltransferase cholera-toxin like (ARTC)
that share the same arginine-serine-glutamate (RSE) motif
as the cholera toxin founding enzyme. The 17 known human enzymes catalyzing
ADP-ribosylation collectively are called poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerases
(PARPs). Although the name implies this family is able to form PAR,
only 4 of the family members are validated to indeed produce PAR,
while most others produce MAR.2 As in most
post-translational modifications, ADP-ribosylation is a dynamic
process in which the polymeric chains can be trimmed down by poly(ADP-ribosyl)glycohydrolases
(PARGs) that cleave the glycoside bonds in PAR, and monomeric ADPr
is removed by (ADP-ribosyl)hydrolases (ARHs), terminal ADP-ribose
protein glycohydrolases (TARGs), or MacroDomain enzymes that cleave
the amino acid ribose bond.4,5 Targeted substrate proteins
have been found to be ADP-ribosylated at arginine, lysine, aspartic
acid, glutamic acid, asparagine, glutamine, serine, threonine, and
cysteine, leading to O-glycosidic, N-glycosidic, or S-glycosidic linkages,
all with subtle differences in intrinsic stabilities and dedicated
transferases and hydrolases responsible for their attachment and removal,
respectively.3 One example is the recent
identification of serine-ADP-ribosylation sites on histone proteins
during DNA damage,6,7 in which histone PARylation Factor
1 (HPF1) switches PARylation by PARP1 and PARP2 from aspartate/glutamate
residues to serine residues specifically.8 Counteracting HPF1/PARP action is hydrolase ARH3 that is found to
be the main enzyme responsible for reversing serine-ADP-ribosylation.9 Another example is the opposing actions of PARP10
that install MAR on acidic amino acid residues (aspartate/glutamate)
in kinase
substrates and MacroD1 and MacroD2 that are able to remove MAR from
these PARP10 substrates.10 In addition
to the variety of transferases and hydrolases, over 800 “reader”
proteins have been identified to have an ADPr-binding domain, showing
the broad impact of ADP-ribosylation and ADPr-dependent signaling.3

in regulating
ADP-ribosylation.

2 Chemical
Synthesis
Several methodologies facilitating the chemical
synthesis of model
peptides carrying MAR and PAR have been developed in order to create
well-defined model substrates that can be used to measure the affinity
between ADPr “reader”-enzymes and ADPr-substrates or
study the cleavage preference of hydrolases. The main challenges in
chemically preparing such ADPr-materials are the construction of the
α-glycosidic bond between the amino acid and ribose parts, the
efficient formation of the pyrophosphate linkage, and finding protecting
group schemes compatible with maintaining the integrity of the delicate
modification.11

2.1 α-Ribosyl
Amino Acids
ART-mediated
displacement of nicotinamide from β-oriented NAD+ by a nucleophilic heteroatom in the side chain of the incoming amino
acid leads to an α-oriented linkage between the amino acid and
ribose moiety (see Figure 2A). A variety of orthogonally α-ribosylated amino acids
have been prepared chemically in order to allow incorporation into
peptides, followed by the installment of the adenosine-diphosphate
moiety afterward. Orthogonally protected ribosyl-asparagine and -glutamine
were the first to be prepared, making use of an anomeric ribosyl azide
that was reduced using a heterogeneous catalyst to yield the anomeric
amine in situ, that was subsequently coupled to the
side-chain carboxylic acid functionality of aspartic or glutamic acid
(see Figure 2B).12,13 The reduction of anomeric azides leads to a mixture of α-
and β- configured amines due to the occurrence of epimerization
in the hemiaminal stage, which on one hand is essential for obtaining
the desired α-configuration but on the other hand leads to a
drop in yield as the nondesired β-product will also be formed.
When using traceless Staudinger-ligation methodology on similar ribosyl
azides, the reaction can be directed to result in the α-configuration
selectively, giving an improved yield.14 An alternative methodology relying on glycosylation chemistry using
ribosyl N-phenyl trifluoroacetimidates allowed the
preparation of not only ribosylated asparagine and glutamine but also
serine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, and citrulline, as an arginine
isoster (see Figure 2C).15,16

the anomeric
configuration. (B) Retrosynthesis of α-ribosyl glutamine from

retrosynthesis of all ribosyl amino acids obtained using imidate glycosylations.

2.2 (Pyro)phosphate Formation
The chemical
formation of the pyrophosphate bond in synthetic PAR- or MAR-peptides
relies on the coupling of a phospho-monoester (phosphate) to an activated
phosphorus species. The Filippov group employs the coupling of adenosine
monophosphate to the in situ prepared phosphorimidazolidate
of the ribosylated peptide on solid support, as the first chemical
synthesis of ADPr-peptides (see Figure 3A).13 Although ADPr-peptide
was formed, the installment of the reactive phosphorimidazolidate
on the immobilized peptide was prone to side reactions, reducing overall
efficiency. Reversing the chemical reactions in this approach by coupling
of the phosphorimidazolidate of adenosine to a ribosyl peptide that
was in situ phosphorylated proved more efficient
(see Figure 3A). This
method was further optimized by introducing a ribosylated amino acid
in the peptide sequence that already carries a protected phosphate
group, which in turn could be easily deprotected and subsequently
reacted with the phosphoramidite of adenosine followed by oxidation
to yield ADPr-peptides (see Figure 3B).15 The Hergenrother group
shows a slightly deviating approach in constructing the pyrophosphate
linkage in a solution-based approach toward ADPr-dimers. In this method,
phosphitylation of suitably protected ribose is followed by hydrolysis
toward the H-phosphonate, which in turn can be activated using N-chloro-succinimide to give a phosphochloridate in situ, that can be condensed with adenosine phosphate
to yield the desired pyrophosphate linkage (see Figure 3C).17 Although
not compared side by side on the same substrates, the authors mention
that in constructing the pyrophosphate linkage in dimeric ADPr the
H-phosphonate methodology is faster and better yielding then the more
conventional phosphomorpholidate or phosphorimidazolide methods used
to form generic pyrophosphates.

coupling protocol on solid support linked peptide, (B) phosphate–phosphoramidite
coupling protocol on solid support linked peptide, and (C) phosphate–H-phosphonate
coupling protocol on ribosyl adenosine in a solution-based method.

3 ADP-Ribosylated Peptides
and Analogues Thereof
In classical Fmoc/Boc-based peptide
synthesis, strong acidic conditions
are used to liberate peptides from the resin and remove protecting
groups at the same time. Such harsh conditions are incompatible with
maintaining ADPr integrity and hence protecting groups, and solid
support linkers that can be cleaved under alkaline conditions need
to be used when constructing ADPr-peptides. Alternatively, the ADPr-moiety
can be introduced post peptide
synthesis, in order to conduct the strong acidic treatment
of the peptide prior to installment of the ADPr-moiety.

The
Filippov lab relies on constructing ADP-ribosylated peptides
on resin equipped with a base-labile linker and base-labile protecting
groups, preventing exposure of the ADPr-peptides to acidic conditions.
Using this methodology, ADPr-peptides carrying the relevant serine-ADPr
linkage and glutamine-, asparagine-, or citrulline-ADPr linkage, as
stable isosters of glutamic acid-, aspartic acid-, or arginine-ADPr,
respectively, can be prepared. Although only relatively short ADPr-peptides
can be constructed using this approach, such peptides were applied
to investigate the binding affinity to macroD2 or TARG1.15 Furthermore, they prepared a biotinylated histone
H2B peptide carrying ADPr on glutamine, as a stabile isostere of the
native glutamate site, that was used to pulldown recombinant ARH3
and PARG in an in vitro experiment under conditions
limiting hydrolytic activity of these enzymes. This pulldown showed
only an interaction between the ADPr-peptide and ARH3 but not PARG,
revealing that of the two hydrolases only ARH3 was able to recognize
MARylated peptides.18 The mutagenesis of
several residues in ARH3 followed by comparing the interaction with
this H2B-ADPr peptide disclosed six residues in ARH3 to be crucial
for MAR binding. A mass spectrometry approach, used to identify the
true ADPr-acceptor sites that could be demodified by ARH3, identified
mostly serine-ADP-ribosylation on the lysine-serine consensus sequence6,7 to be recognized by ARH3.18 Chemical
preparation using the Filippov protocol of the reported physiologically
relevant substrate, Histone H2B ADP-ribosylated at serine-10, gave
acces to the native α-glycosidic ADPr linkage and its non-native
β-isomer.19 Both peptides were incubated
with ARH3 in a study to reveal that ARH3 hydrolase activity is selective
for the α-ADPr-linkage.

The Muir lab uses a post peptide
synthesis approach to install ADPr-groups on short peptides
by introducing amino-oxy-containing amino acids into the peptide and
subsequently performing oxime ligation on ADP-ribose (see Figure 4A).20 This strategy leads to ring-opened furanose conjugates,
but also ring-closed isomers can be generated using N-methyl amino-oxy-containing peptides, although this last reaction
is slow and low yielding. Such ADPr-peptide conjugates interacted
with macrodomains on histone proteins, and these interactions, being
in the micromolar affinity range, were strong enough to facilitate
pulldown of the histone macrodomain. When introducing a benzophenone
photo-cross-linking group to these ADPr–peptide conjugates,
covalent capture of interacting proteins with the ADPr-peptide and
pulldown from cell lysates was shown to be feasible. Using such an
oxime-linked ADPr-peptide in a high-throughput screen on human macrodomain
proteins, a highly selective allosteric inhibitor able to modulate
macrodomain 2 activity of PARP14 was identified.21 This inhibitor prevents PARP14 to localize on sites of
DNA damage and hence might be an interesting drug lead, as PARP14
is associated with inflammatory diseases and different types of cancer.

and (B) CuAAC ligation.

Another approach uses
a copper-catalyzed azide alkyne cycloaddition
reaction (CuAAC or commonly called “click chemistry”),
where an alkyne-modified ADPr-synthon is conjugated to azide-modified
peptides (see Figure 4B). Similar to oxime ligation, this allows for the post-peptide synthesis
introduction of ADPr.22 Not only can peptides
be ADP-ribosylated using this method but also small proteins can be
conjugated, as was shown by the introduction of ADPr on azides substituting
Arg42- or Gly76-sites in the 8.5 kDa ubiquitin protein. Although this
conjugation chemistry leads to an artificial triazole linkage between
ADPr and the protein, autoubiquitination assays using the Legionella
effector SdeA enzyme show significant autoubiquitinating occurring,
although at a reduced rate compared to the wild-type native ADPr-Ub.
These results however show the adaptability of this click approach
to ADPribosylate, not only peptides but also full-length proteins,
and use them in assaying enzymatic reactions in vitro.

4 Poly-ADP-Ribose Chains
The synthesis of poly-ADPr
brings a distinct challenge, as
an α-oriented ribosyl linkage to adenosine needs to be constructed
rather than an α-oriented ribosyl linkage to an amino acid.
The crucial repeating unit in poly-ADPr is ribosyl-adenosine (see Figure 5B) which has been
synthesized using different routes.23,24 Analogues
of this repeating unit have been shown to have an inhibitory effect
on PARP-1.25 The pioneering attempts were
followed by syntheses introducing orthogonally protected phosphorus
species at both ends of the ribosyl-adenosine, allowing the preparation
of pyrophosphate linkages and the formation of ADPr-dimers.17 The authors showed that these synthetically
prepared ADPr-dimers were hydrolyzed by active PARG and not by the
catalytically inactive glycohydrolase. The authors also report the
crystal structure of inactive human PARG with the dimeric ADPr-substrate
at a resolution of 1.9 Å, representing the first structure of
the human PARG-enzyme and its substrate. By introducing an alkyne
moiety on the anomeric position of the ADPr-dimer, a fluorescent label
(Cy3) or affinity tag (biotin) could be introduced using copper-catalyzed
click chemistry. The fluorescently labeled ADPr-dimer was applied
in a general fluorescence polarization-based PAR–protein binding
assay to determine the dissociation constants between an inactive
(E756N or E755N) human PARG mutant with Kd values of 83 nM and 208 nM, respectively.17

Figure 5 (A)

linear poly-ADPr, and (C) repeating unit for branched poly-ADPr.

The embracement of solid-support-based synthesis
in an automated
fashion has led to the construction of larger ADPr-oligomers in a
straightforward manner (see Figure 5A).26 In this approach,
a phosphoramidite-equipped ribosyl-adenosine building block, carrying
a protected phosphate, is coupled to a phosphate riboside attached
to a resin. After coupling and oxidation, a pyrophosphate bond is
formed giving rise to mono-ADPr. Subsequent deprotection of the terminal
phosphate is the start of the next cycle of elongation to yield a
dimeric ADPr, which in turn can be elongated to yield trimeric ADPr.
The thus-prepared PAR fragments were applied in studying the chromatin
remodeler ALC1 in vitro.(27) The affinity for the ADP-ribose monomer, dimer, and trimer with
the macrodomain of ALC1 was determined using isothermal titration
calorimetry (ITC). The intramolecular ALC1 ATPase-macrodomain shows
an increase in affinity from micromolar (dimer) to nanomolar (trimer),
whereas the monomer hardly shows interaction at all. A thermal shift
assay also reveals significant stabilization of the macrodomain upon
binding to the apparent minimal signal, tri-ADPr. The interaction
of the trimer with the macrodomain was found to be an allosteric trigger
to the conformational change of ALC1 that releases the autoinhibitory
effect and switches on its enzymatic chromatin relaxation activity.
The access to such synthetically prepared ADPr-oligomers was indispensable
in the mechanistic studies of the oncogenic ALC1-protein.

In
addition, the synthesis of the core motif found in branched
ADPr-chains, ribosyl-ribosyl-adenosine28 and its triple monophosphate29 will without
doubt lead to more complex branched poly-ADPr-chains in the near future,
when applied in a similar automated solid-phase procedure (see Figure 5C).

5 Fluorescence-Based Assays
ADPr-based substrates carrying
fluorogenic 4-(trifluoromethyl)umbelliferone
on the anomeric position of ribose allows for determination of kinetic
parameters of PARGs and ARHs.30 This substrate
is not fluorescent until enzymatic actions hydrolyze the glycosidic
bond upon which an increase in fluorescence can be observed as a direct
measure of enzyme activity (see Figure 6A). Neither reactions with β-oriented substrates
nor catalytic inactive mutants of the enzymes gave an increase of
fluorescent signal, validating the mode of action of these enzymes.
Another assay relies on the chemical reaction of NAD+ with
benzamidine to create a fluorophore in situ. The
fluorescence, therefore, is a direct measure of nonconsumed NAD+, which can be directly correlated to PARP activity and inhibition
thereof (see Figure 6B).31 Although this last assay does not
monitor the formation of ADPr, but rather focuses on the presence
(and consumption) of NAD+, its utility in a high-throughput
format to identify PARP inhibitors makes it a very useful technique
in the ADPr-toolbox.

NAD+ to a fluorescent NAD analogue.

6 Tools to Target ADP-Ribosylation in a Cellular
Context
Most of the tools described above are applied in vitro, on recombinantly expressed and purified proteins,
without the broader
context of protein–protein interactions or the dynamic environment
of the cell. Approaches to study ADPr-dynamics and localization as
well as an unbiased identification of substrate proteins modified
by this PTM are of added value to the in vitro tools.
Severals methods have been devised to use small-molecule probes that
utilize the native ADP-ribosylation machinery inside cells. One such
an example is the development of the amino-oxy probes by Cohen and
co-workers that allow trapping of ADPr-proteins with a glutamate or
aspartate site of conjugation. ADPr-peptide ester linkages can undergo
ADPr transfer from the 1′- to 2′-hydroxyl moiety, resulting
in an equilibrium state of the ribose between a closed 1′-hydroxyl
and opened 1′-aldehyde stage (see Figure 7A). This aldehyde can react with the amino-oxy
probe at acidic pH (4.0–4.5) to generate a stable oxime linkage.
The alkyne on the amino-oxy reagent can subsequently be used in click
conjugation of a fluorophore. This approach was used to visualize
cellular ADPr-proteins effected by PARPs during oxidative stress conditions.32

Figure 7 (A) Amino-oxy probes for use in oxime labeling of ester-linked
ADPr-proteins. (B) Two alkyne-modified NAD analogues to be incorporated
in ADPr-chains in cellular applications.

Another approach relies on chemically prepared NAD+ analogues
carrying alkynes, cyclopropene, or cyclooctyne as a bio-orthogonal
handle that can also be applied in cellular systems, allowing the
formation of labeled ADPr-chains, that can be visualized after conjugation
of fluorescent dyes onto the bio-orthogonal functionality in real
time (see Figure 7B).33−36 Conjugation of a biotin tag to such alkyne-modified ADPr-proteins
followed by MS–MS proteomics gives insight into the ADPribosylome.36 This method resembles the earlier reported approach
where biotin-NAD is used to mark ADPr-chains with the affinity tag,
with the difference that in the two-step labeling approach modification
of the NAD structure by the handle is minimal and hence reduces interference
of the handle when incorporated into ADPr-chains.37 A chemo-enzymatic approach or fully chemical synthesis
of 3′-azido-modified NAD+ is recently reported.38 This NAD+ analogue has high activity
and specificity for PARylation mediated by PARP1. The modified PAR
polymers are found to be less efficiently degraded by PARG than the
native polymers, allowing these tools to be used to visualize PARylation
in cells and label PARylated proteins in the cell lysate.

A
recent report by the Leung group introduces the enzymatic labeling
of a terminal ADP-ribose (ELTA) technique in which the enzyme 2′-5′-oligoadenylate
synthetase 1 (OAS1) uses a modified dATP analogue to label a protein
conjugated to ADPr.39 Using dATP-analogues
carrying a radioactive, fluorescent, or affinity label, this technique
can be applied to investigate a MAR- or PARylated proteome.

The group of Cohen reports a different approach using alkyne carrying
NAD+ analogues by finding combinations of genetically engineered
mARTs that utilize chemically modified NAD+-alkyne analogues.
In this approach, the modified NAD+ can only be used by
the genetically engineered mART to ADPribosylate its targets.40,41 Subsequent click chemistry on the alkyne and MS–MS analysis
reveals the substrates modified by the engineered mART. Using this
methodology, ADPr-substrates can be identified and simultaneously
linked to the transferase that performed the action.42

7 Conclusion and Outlook
Due to its delicate
nature and instability during acidic chemical
treatments, ADP-ribosylation gained relatively little attention when
compared to other post-translational modifications such as, for instance,
glycosylation. ADP-ribosylation, however, is a prevalent PTM, and
ADPr-chains are even considered to be the third type of nucleic acid,
after DNA and RNA. To study the
broad impact this modification has on a variety of cellular (signaling)
processes, tools to visualize and modulate the activity of the conjugating
and deconjugating enzymes have been under development. The development
of chemical methodology to create ADPr-based material
avoiding strong acidic conditions by making use of protecting groups
that can be removed using alkaline treatment allowed the construction
of native ADPr-peptides and ADPr-chains. Such peptides and chains
were shown to be very useful in studying the details and preferences
of ARH and PARG enzymes. Translating these chemistries to solid-phase
approaches led to more advanced constructs and will expand the scope
and complexity of chemically prepared ADPr-material even further in
the near future. The adaptation of commonly known ligation methodology,
such as oxime ligation and copper-mediated azide alkyne cycloaddition
reactions, has also proven to be of value in terms of making ADPr-protein
conjugates. This method can be further applied in the near future
by using expression-based systems to include azides into native proteins
that can be ADPribosylated using CuAAC chemistry. The preparation
of both ADPr-peptides carrying the native linkage and those joined
together via bio-orthogonal reactions resulted in the controlled synthesis
of well-defined ADPr-materials. Equipping such molecules with fluorescent
dyes, affinity tags such as biotin or photo-cross-linking groups makes
them useful tools in chemical biology approaches, casting a light
on enzymatic properties such as substrate preference, affinity, and
structural details that could not have been obtained through enzymatic
preparation of (nonmodified) ADPr-chains. The development of modified
NAD+ analogues and their incorporation into ADPr-chains
using the ADPr-machinery in cellular settings, combined with the development
of more sensitive mass spectrometry methods, opens up a new field
of research, in which the ADPribosylome can be studied. In addition,
the development of assays facilitating high-throughput screening of
modulators of ADPr-metabolism is essential for the future development
of, e.g., inhibitors of ART-activity. Furthermore, new substrates
are being identified showing ADP-ribosylation on: (1) the phosphorylated
ends of RNA by PARP10,43 (2) thymidine
residues in single-stranded DNA by Mycobacterium tuberculosis ADPr-transferase DarT,44 and (3) the
phosphate ends of DNA duplexes or single-stranded oligonucleotides
by PARP1/2.45 The biological role of such
hybrid oligonucleotides remains largely speculative, but their identification
shows that there is still a lot to be unveiled in the realm of ADPr-biology,
a quest that will benefit from the preparation of specific assay reagents
and probes.
