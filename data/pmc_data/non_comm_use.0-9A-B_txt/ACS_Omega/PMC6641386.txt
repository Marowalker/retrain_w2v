In this paper, the synergistic effect
of porosity and gradient
of Mo doping in BiVO4 photoanodes for improving charge
separation and solar water oxidation performance is reported. A simple
solution-based, three-step fabrication route was adopted using a layer-by-layer
assembling technique. A water oxidation photocurrent of ∼1.73
mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode
in neutral pH was achieved without using any sacrificial agent or
electrocatalyst. The gradient Mo doping was found to enhance charge
separation efficiency, which was verified through a shift in the water
oxidation onset potential cathodically to ∼200 mV. In addition,
these results were further confirmed by a higher open-circuit photovoltage
and flat band potential investigations. This was attributed to the
surface energetics played by gradient Mo doping that served as the
driving force in reducing the onset potential for water oxidation.
The coupled effect of enhanced light absorption and charge separation
was revealed by monitoring the difference in decoupling the water
oxidation efficiencies of porous and planar Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes.
This study demonstrated an improvement in the catalytic and charge
separation efficiency of Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes due to the
introduction of porous structured homojunctions in a gradient manner.
The simple synthesis approach adopted in the present study can be
utilized and scaled up in making efficient photoanodes for competent
solar water oxidation cells.

Introduction
Growing concerns over
the environmental pollution due to the burning
of nonrenewable energy resources have driven scientists to explore
the development of efficient energy-conversion system, where solar
energy and water-based renewable energy resources are utilized. The
photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell is one promising system, where solar
energy is utilized by semiconductors to split water into hydrogen
and oxygen.1,2 However, for this to be commercially viable,
further improvement in its efficiency must be achieved. BiVO4 is known to be one of the promising candidates, used as photoanode
for O2 evolution in PEC water-splitting device3−6 owing to its suitable band edge positioning for water oxidation,
visible light absorption, low cost, and availability in large amounts.
Theoretically, the maximum photocurrent for BiVO4 that
is achievable with a band gap of ∼2.4 eV, is ∼7.5 mA
cm–2.5,75,7 But, the poor
water oxidation kinetics, high electron–hole recombination
rate, and low conductivity are challenges in achieving this photocurrent
value.8,9 Recently, theoretical10,11 and experimental studies7,11−13 have shown that tungsten (W) and molybdenum (Mo) can improve the
conductivity and minimize charge recombination in BiVO4. Because the minority carrier diffusion length of BiVO4 varies from 60 to 200 nm and the light absorption depth is ∼250
nm at 420 nm,8,12−15 making nanostructures and introducing
porosity are the effective ways to tackle the low efficiency of this
photoactive semiconductor due to a low charge diffusion length and
a limited light absorption depth. Porosity can enhance the number
of catalytic sites and improve the light absorption in the BiVO4 matrix.15 An improved light absorption
was achieved by creating scattering centers inside the porous structures.16−18 In addition, it was reported that nanostructuring can also improve
the electronic properties and achieve a higher photocurrent under
front illuminated conditions (BiVO4 side).15,19,20 An enhanced charge separation
is reported by introducing (040) facet into BiVO4 photoanodes,
which efficiently improve the charge accumulation at the interface
junction and, thereby, lead to improved water oxidation efficiency.21,22 However, one drawback of nanostructuring is the increased interfacial
recombination due to an increase in surface area, thus affecting the
charge separation and transfer efficiency. Because gradient doping
of W:BiVO4 has been reported to improve charge separation
by increasing the band bending due to the formation of homojunctions,23 we used gradient Mo-doped nanoporous BiVO4 to enhance both charge separation and charge transport.

The production of nanoporous Mo:BiVO4 is produced by
a layer-by-layer assembly technique. A systematic investigation of
the effect of sacrificial polymer content, number of layers, and gradient
of Mo-doping was assayed by water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanodes by optimizing for the best photocurrents. A gradient
effect in the PEC performance was demonstrated and compared with the
planar Mo-doped BiVO4 and obtained a a higher photocurrent
of ∼1.7 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE). A shift in water oxidation potential toward cathodic
region was observed for gradient Mo:BiVO4, which makes
this material suitable for combination with a photocathode or a solar
cell. The present study demonstrates a simple but effective route
to fabricate BiVO4 based photoanodes and provides an insight
into the role of porosity and graded Mo-doping for improving the efficiency
and charge separation for photoelectrochemical water oxidation.

Results
and Discussion
Photoelectrochemical Performance of Layer-by-Layer
Assembled
Porous Structures
Porous graded Mo:BiVO4 films
with different amounts of porosity and Mo doping (2 atomic %) were
fabricated with a layer-by-layer assembly technique using spin-coating
and successive annealing. The detailed fabrication procedure and the
naming of the photoanodes are discussed in the Supporting Information (cf. Experimental
Section). Poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) was used as the sacrificial
polymer to introduce porosity into BiVO4. The schematic
representation of BiVO4 photoanodes with varying porosities
are shown in Figure S1a. To assess the
optimum thickness of the photoanode for maximum light absorption,
the number of layers was varied from one to four. The schematic representation
of BiVO4 photoanodes with varying number of layers is shown
in Figure S1b. The samples were labeled
as P25, P75, P100, P150, and P175 based on the amount of polymer content
and the number of layers are labeled as 1, 2, 3, and 4. The photocurrent
densities at 1.23 V vs RHE were extracted from the linear sweep voltammogram
(LSV) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte for the photoanodes
(Figure 1a,b). It can
be seen from Figure 1a,b that the maximum photocurrent was produced for P100 samples (∼1.7
mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs RHE) fabricated in three layers
with 0.1 g mL–1 PVP incorporated in a solvent mixture.
In all of the cases, the photocurrent increased up to three layers
and decreased when the fourth layer was introduced (Figure 1b,c). It can be seen that light
absorption increased with increasing sacrificial polymer content (Figure S2a) to reach a maximum when the sacrificial
polymer content was ∼0.1 g mL–1 (P100), and
then remained constant with any further increase in the polymer content.
This is consistent with increasing light harvesting efficiency by
increasing the optical path length at the wavelength that corresponds
to the band edge.24,25 At a higher polymer content,
the thickness of the film was increased (>600 nm, Figure S3), which restricted the ability of photogenerated
electrons to diffuse to reaching the back contact. The increase in
porosity with increasing sacrificial polymer content was revealed
in the field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images
(Figure S4a–e). It was also evident
from UV–vis absorption spectra and FESEM images that the light
absorption as well as porosity increased with increased layering (Figures S2b and S5a–h), and the improved
performance for P100 was attributed to the optimization of light absorption
and diffusion length.12,13 However beyond a depth of 400
nm, the light absorption cannot be enhanced further by increasing
the thickness or porosity of the film.15

gradient Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes in which the amount of sacrificial
polymer was varied from 0.025 to 0.175 g mL–1. (b)
The photocurrent densities shown were at 1.23 V vs RHE for photoanodes
fabricated with different polymer content and different thickness
and (c) comparison of LSV of P100 samples fabricated in different
thickness. The measurements were carried out in 0.5 M Na2SO4 under front-side illumination conditions.

Individual annealing after each spin-coating was
crucial for building
a porous structure as revealed from the comparative LSV plot of the
layer-by-layer assembled photoanode and the sample constructed using
a three-step spin-coating with annealing (Figure S6). The result clearly showed that the proposed technique
played a critical role in producing porous structures that enhanced
light absorption and an effective surface area to create more catalytically
active water oxidation sites. The crystal structure and band gap of
all pristine and Mo-doped BiVO4 were found to be consistent
with the values for scheelite monoclinic structure (cf. Figure S7a,b).5,26

Water Oxidation
Performance Evaluation and Comparison of Porous
and Planar Gradient Mo:BiVO4 Films
The optimized
synthesis condition used for fabricating P100 photoanodes was adopted
for the study of gradient Mo-doped BiVO4. To evaluate the
effect of creating homojunctions in a gradient manner, we fabricated
porous pristine and Mo-doped BiVO4 samples, which were
designated as 000P, 012P, 222P, and 210P, as represented in Figure 2b. The fabrication
procedure for porous BiVO4 photoanode is schematically
shown in Figure S8. The digits 0, 1, and
2 represented the atomic percentage of Mo incorporated in each layer
and “P” indicated its porosity. LSVs were recorded under
dark and illuminated (1 Sun) conditions in 0.5 M Na2SO4 electrolyte (pH = 6.8) and are shown in Figure 2c. We observed similar photocurrent
for samples 012P and 210P (1.7 ± 0.1 mA cm–2), whereas 222P showed a slightly lower performance of ∼1.4
± 0.03 mA cm–2. The photocurrent at 1.23 V
vs RHE for the entire Mo-doped BiVO4 samples were higher
than the BiVO4-based photoanodes reported in the literature
(cf. Table S1). Moreover, the photocurrent
of 210P sample was found to be 2.8 times higher than that of the 000P
photoanode. This was also revealed from the photocurrent stability
plots as shown in Figure 2d. Though the porous structure imparted improved photocurrent,
the porosity also had an adverse effect on having trap states that
prevented photogenerated holes for further reactions due to surface
recombination.24 This surface recombination
resulted in photocurrent transients as shown in the stability plot
(Figure 2d). To further
elucidate the gradient effect in porous structure, we avoided the
poor water oxidation kinetics by performing LSVs in the presence of
a hole scavenger (0.5 M Na2SO3).27−29 When the hole scavenger like Na2SO3 or H2O2 is used, the catalytic efficiency (ηcatalysis) equals 1 and the photocurrent can be attributed
to the effect of charge separation. Thus, using a hole scavenger in
the present study enables one to deconvolute the effect of gradient
doping from the synergistic effect of porosity and gradient doping.
The photocurrent densities observed in the current density–time
transients (Figure 2e) under illuminated conditions at 1 V vs RHE were higher for 210P
and the effect of gradient doping was evident. The present results
confirm the presence of enhanced charge separation by gradient doping.

plot for the porous pristine and Mo-doped BiVO4 samples
in 0.5 M Na2SO4 + 0.5 M Na2SO3 electrolyte at 1 V vs RHE.

Comparing the photocurrent densities under front-side (BiVO4 side) and back-side illumination (fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) side), a higher water oxidation performance of ∼0.6 mA
cm–2 at 1.23 V RHE for pristine sample (000P) was
observed under back-side illumination (from FTO side) (Figure 3a). This showed that the water
oxidation performance of pristine BiVO4 was limited mainly
by electron transport.9,30,31 In contrast, we achieved a higher photocurrent for Mo:BiVO4 under front-side illumination condition. The difference in photocurrent
under front-side and back-side illumination was monitored by conducting
the LSV in 0.5 M Na2SO4. All of the porous Mo-doped
photoanodes (012P, 222P, and 210P) showed an enhanced photocurrent
under front-side illumination and the comparison of photocurrents
under front-side and back-side illumination are shown in Figure 3b–d. The studies
indicated that under front-side illumination, holes can be efficiently
extracted for water oxidation and an increase in the electron transport
can be achieved due to the combined effect of Mo doping and porosity,
where Mo doping has a dominant role in improving the photocurrent
under the front-side illumination. The effect was also demonstrated
in our previous work, where porous Mo-doped BiVO4 fabricated
by electrospinning technique showed a higher photocurrent under front-side
illumination.15 A comparison of the photocurrent
under back-side illumination condition (FTO side) for 000P, 012P,
222P, and 210P, viz, 0.66, 0.97, 1.02, and 1.35 mA cm–2, respectively, showed a higher charge separation for the 210P samples.

Further investigations
were carried out to deconvolute the effect
of porosity and graded doping by making a set of photoanodes without
incorporating PVP (sacrificial polymer that is responsible for the
porous structure) and comparing its water oxidation performance with
porous gradient doped samples. The fabricated planar photoanodes were
then labeled as 000, 012, 222, and 210 and are schematically shown
in Figure S9. According to the presumed
charge separation, as a result of homojunction formation, enhanced
charged separation was clearly observed for the 210 samples from the
LSVs of the planar BiVO4 photoanodes (Figure 4a) with the photocurrent of
∼0.89 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. This value
was similar to the one reported for graded W:BiVO4 (∼1
mA cm–2) at 1.23 V vs RHE.23 However, in the case of photoanodes fabricated in 000, 012, and
222 fashion, the photocurrent values are smaller, compared to 210.
The improvement in the photocurrent by gradient effect was 4 times
higher for 210 compared to that for 000. We attributed this effect
to the inadequate charge separation and associated recombination effect
for 000, 222, and 012 samples. The gradient effects in the case of
planar samples were further supported by the stability test (Figure S10a) at 1.23 V vs RHE in 0.5 M Na2SO4. The lack of formation of porosity in this
case was also revealed from the surface morphology, as shown in Figure S10b. A comparative photocurrent performance
of porous and planar photoanodes (LSV under illumination of 000 vs
000P and 210 vs 210P, Figure 4b) confirmed that the incorporation of porosity improved the
water oxidation performance significantly. Thus, the dominant role
of porosity is supported by the stability plot and incident photon-to-current
conversion efficiency (IPCE) graph as shown in Figure 4c,d. From the present results, it was evident
that in the case of porous gradient Mo:BiVO4 samples, there
was a synergy between the porosity and gradient doping, where the
introduction of porosity enhanced light absorption, whereas gradient
doping improved charge separation. Thus, this coupling effect was
responsible for the improvement in the photocurrent efficiency of
the layer-by-layer assembled Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes. In addition,
because the configurations other than 210P (222P and 012P) showed
similar photocurrent performances, it can be assumed that the porosity
effect is dominant over the gradient doping.

conditions for the planar BiVO4 photoanodes. (b) Comparison

vs 210P in 0.5 M Na2SO4, where significant increase
in the photocurrent observed for porous samples.

IPCE of porous and planar photoanodes agreed well with enhanced
water oxidation performance of porous photoanodes compared to the
planar system (cf. Figure S11a,b). An enhanced
IPCE up to 40% at 380 nm was observed for Mo-doped porous samples,
which was 10 times higher than that of the pristine BiVO4. The gradient behavior for the planar BiVO4 samples was
further evident from the IPCE spectra of the planar BiVO4 samples (Figure S11b). The photon conversion
efficiency was higher for the 210 sample compared to other planar
samples, clearly indicating a better charge separation due to gradient
doping. The IPCE for all of the samples appeared with a tail extending
to 525 nm, indicating the band gap of ∼2.4 eV. It can be seen
from Figure S11a that the IPCE spectra
of samples 012P, 222P, and 210P showed similar behavior, again ascribed
to the dominant effect of porosity. Even though the charge separation
was enhanced, the major reasons for the enhanced photocurrent were
attributed to the increase in light absorption and catalytic sites
due to enhanced porosity achieved by layer-by-layer assembly.

Water oxidation onset potential is an important parameter in PEC-based
solar energy conversion technology, where proper overlapping of the
onset potentials for water oxidation and reduction currents are essential
to operate under zero bias or lower applied bias conditions.32 A shift in cathodic onset potential is also
a qualitative evidence of gradient nature, where a negative shifting
of the Fermi level and hence a better charge separation can be achieved
for water oxidation.23 Additionally, the
more cathodic the onset potential, better will be the efficiency for
the photoanode when used in tandem devices, thus increasing the overall
efficiency of the PEC cells. We investigated the water oxidation onset
potential for the porous and planar photoanodes by a fast chopping
illumination method, from which we could trace the correct region
of photocurrent initiation (Figure 5a,b). It is evident from the plots that both porous
and planar samples have similar trend in the water oxidation onset
potential, and 210P and 210 samples have a more cathodic onset potential
shift (0.42 and 0.447 V vs RHE, respectively) compared to other samples.
These values were ∼150 mV more anodic than the flat band potential
of BiVO4.15 Nevertheless, the
onset potentials observed for pristine BiVO4 (000P and
000) photoanodes was ∼0.6 V vs RHE, which was in agreement
with our previous results.15,31 Thus, these results
were indicative of effective band bending due to gradient doping,
thereby acquiring a better charge separation. This study confirmed
that the gradient behavior was present in the porous photoanode as
well. The charge transfer efficiencies of the porous and planar BiVO4 photoanodes were further compared using electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) studies and the Nyquist plots recorded at 1.23
V (Figure 5c,d). It
can be inferred from Figure 5c that the diameter of the Nyquist plot corresponding to 210P
among porous samples was the lowest, indicating an efficient charge
transfer at the semiconductor–electrolyte interface. A similar
case was observed for 210 samples among other systems in planar photoanodes
(Figure 5d). A comparison
of samples 210P and 210 showed that the former exhibited the least
charge transport resistance, revealing the better efficiency in water
oxidation. The study further supports the finding that a combined
effect of porosity and gradient nature in 210P samples facilitated
a better charge transfer kinetics for water oxidation.

and (d) planar BiVO4 samples at 1.23 V vs RHE revealing
a better charge transfer resistance for water oxidation in the case
of porous gradient Mo:BiVO4.

To asess the improved charge separation due to gradient doping,
we conducted the Mott–Schottky (MS) analysis of the porous
samples (000P, 012P, 222P, and 210P) in 0.5 M Na2SO4 under dark conditions. The flat band potential (Vfb) and carrier density (Nd) are extracted from the MS plot (Figure S12) and tabulated in Table S1. Figure S12 and Table S1 show that a cathodic
shift in the flat band potential (−0.3 V vs RHE) is evident
for 210P sample compared to other samples. This shows a better charge
separation for gradient Mo-doped photoanode, and the trend corroborates
the onset potential measurements (Figure 5b). It is also noted that the carrier density
of 210P sample increased to 1 order of magnitude higher (1.7 ×
1021 cm–3), indicating that more charge
carriers are available at the electrode–electrolyte interface
for water oxidation reaction. It should be noted here that the Nd values extracted from the MS plot do not represent
the absolute concentration because we used the model corresponding
to the planar system. However, this study could show a qualitative
trend in the change in carrier concentration and Vfb values when a gradient effect is introduced. The improved
charge separation due to gradient doping was further correlated for
both porous and planar samples by open-circuit photovoltage (OCPV)
measurements under AM 1.5 illumination. The details of the technique
and the experimental procedure are given in the Supporting Information. The change in OCPV upon illumination
followed the charge separation efficiency and band bending at the
semiconductor–electrolyte interface. The OCPV under dark and
illuminated conditions were monitored for pristine and Mo:BiVO4 samples (both porous and planar) and shown in Figure S13a,b. Enhanced OCPV was observed in
the case of 210P and 210 samples compared to other porous/planar photoanodes,
indicating efficient charge separation by gradient Mo doping. The
degree of band bending can be qualitatively visualized by the change
in OCPV, which was dependent on both built-in potential and extent
of recombination.33,34 The OCPV values calculated from
the difference in open-circuit potential under dark and illuminated
conditions for all of the samples are graphically represented in Figure 6a. The numerical
values of ΔOCPV (−0.214 and −0.187 V for 210P
and 210 photoanodes, respectively) were more or less similar in both
porous and planar gradient samples, indicating a similar mechanism
behind charge separation in both cases. When the photoelectrodes were
modified with gradient Mo doping, the degree of band bending was altered
and the surface energetics improved. It was clear from the photovoltage
measurement that change in surface energetics due to graded Mo doping
served as the driving force for reducing the onset potential for water
oxidation.7,34 Based on the two approaches (photocurrent
onset and photovoltage measurements) employed for visualizing the
gradient effect, we proposed the possible band structures for best
charge separation in the case of pristine and graded Mo:BiVO4 samples, as shown in Figure 6b,c. The long-term stability of the 210P photoanodes is evaluated
(Figure S14), where we applied 1 V vs RHE
and measured the current density under static mode and ∼18%
decrease in the photocurrent was observed after 2.5 h of stability
test.

(red) on porous and planar BiVO4 samples. Schematic illustration

of (b) pristine and (c) gradient Mo:BiVO4. ηong is lesser than ηon due
the gradient doping effect.

The catalytic efficiency (ηcatalysis) and
charge
separation (ηseparation) were calculated35 and compared for the 210P and 210 samples, and
are shown in Figure 7a,b. JH2O and JH2O2 were the photocurrent densities
in Na2SO4 and Na2SO3,
respectively, as shown in Figure 7c. From Figure 7a, the ηcatalysis was found to be better
for the porous samples (∼32% at 1 V vs RHE), owing to the presence
of more catalytic sites compared to the planar sample (∼15%
at 1 V vs RHE). Nevertheless, the ηseparation at
lower potentials (Figure 7b) was more or less similar for both porous and planar samples
and it increased for the porous samples (∼85% for porous and
∼75% for planar at 1 V vs RHE) when shifting to more positive
potentials. This indicates that the charge separation improved in
both cases and was facilitated by gradient doping in both porous and
planar photoelectrodes. This also indicated that approximately 10–20%
photogenerated charge carriers are lost due to recombination before
water oxidation process. The calculated Jabs values were found to be 4.49 and 3.71 mA cm–2 for
210P and 210 photoanodes, respectively, revealing a better light absorption
capability of porous photoanode (210P), and is graphically shown in Figure 7d. Thus, the present
study provides a facile technique to fabricate efficient photoanodes,
where the bulk and surface recombination issues were addressed by
gradient doping and porosity. A systematic investigation of the correlation
of the amount of sacrificial polymer, the number of layers, and the
gradient doping with the solar water oxidation performance of BiVO4 photoanodes have been extensively carried out to optimize
the photocurrent. However, the present system faces the problem of
surface recombination, which was inferred by the photocurrent–time
transient. This issue can be addressed by introducing a co-catalyst,
which can improve the charge-transfer processes at the electrode–electrolyte
interface. Thus, the future work in this field should focus on further
improvement in photocurrent and onset potential by employing an O2 evolution electrocatalyst to realize a high-performance stable
photoanode.

Conclusions
A simple fabrication strategy was adopted
to develop Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes having excellent charge
separation and high photocurrent.
A better electron mobility was visualized as a higher photocurrent
under the front-side illumination condition for porous gradient Mo:BiVO4 without applying any co-catalyst or using costly fabrication
techniques. Under optimized conditions, the photocurrent of ∼1.73
mA cm–2 was achieved at 1.23 V for gradient porous
Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes. The enhanced effect is credited to
an increase in the amount of scattering centers, thus enhancing light
absorption and catalytic sites. Better charge separations for porous
samples were achieved by creating homojunctions by gradient Mo doping,
which was further confirmed by cathodic shift of water oxidation onset
potential and Mott–Schottky studies. The open-circuit photovoltage
and EIS studies further supported the enhanced band bending, improved
surface energetics, and charge transfer efficiency at the electrode–electrolyte
interface of the porous gradient Mo:BiVO4 photoanodes.
The studies showed that the porosity has a dominant effect in improving
the water oxidation current for porous graded Mo:BiVO4 structure.
Thus, the simple fabrication approach reported in this paper can be
adopted for making efficient photoanodes without compromising their
other beneficial aspects for future competent solar water oxidation
cells.

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Photoanodes
In a typical
synthesis procedure,
bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich), and vanadium acetyl acetonate (V(OAcAc)2, 98%, Sigma-Aldrich) were mixed in 1:1 molar ratio in 0.3
mmol and added into 1 mL of acetic acid (Sigma-Aldrich), 2 mL of absolute
ethanol (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1.25 mL of N,N-dimethyl formamide (Sigma-Aldrich) to form a homogeneous
solution followed by the addition of 0.4 g poly(vinyl pyrollidone)
(PVP, Mw 130 000, Sigma-Aldrich).
The effect of sacrificial polymer content for optimizing the best-performing
photoanode is studied by varying the concentration of PVP as 0.025,
0.075, 0.1, 0.15, and 0.175 g mL–1 of the solvent
mixture used. The samples prepared are represented as P25, P75, P100,
P150, and P175, where the numbers represent the amount of PVP used
in g mL–1. Mo doping is achieved by adding ammonium
molybdate tetra hydrate ((NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O) (99.98% trace metal basis, Sigma-Aldrich)
at 1 and 2 mol %, resulting in a mixture containing Bi/(V + Mo) in
1:1 ratio to replace V positions in the BiVO4 crystal lattice.
To understand the gradient doping effect alone, a set of Mo:BiVO4 samples are fabricated without introducing PVP and referred
as planar samples. The precursor mixtures are magnetically stirred
at room temperature for 6 h to form viscous solution. Before the deposition,
the FTO glass are cleaned by ultrasonicating in distilled water, ethanol,
and acetone successively and finally dried in N2 stream.
For a single-layer coating of each BiVO4 film, about 100
μL of precursor solution is spin-coated (speed 2000 rpm, time
45 s) onto 1 × 2 cm2 FTO glass, which is then annealed
in air at 500 °C for 2 h to ensure the complete decomposition
of PVP and improve the crystallinity of BiVO4. The spin-coating
and annealing steps are repeated 3 times to obtain crystalline films
and the schematic of the fabrication is shown in Figure S1. Four different types of photoanodes are fabricated
by the above-mentioned method for comparing the PEC performance. For
the first type of photoanode, all of the three layers are composed
of pristine BiVO4, which is named as 000P. In the case
of second type, BiVO4 is the bottom layer, BiV0.99Mo0.01O4 the middle layer, and BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 the top layer (012P). All of the layers
are BiV0.98Mo0.02O4 (222P) in the
third type of photoanode. In fourth case, the first layer is BiV0.98Mo0.02O4, the middle layer is composed
of BiV0.99Mo0.01O4, and the top layer
is pristine BiVO4 (210P). The 012P configuration is used
in the present study to check the effect of hindering the charge separation
in photocurrent. The samples prepared without PVP under the similar
conditions mentioned above are labeled as 000, 012, 222, and 210.
All of the photoanodes after the final step of annealing are taken
for morphological and structural characterizations and finally photoelectrochemical
performance studies.

Characterization
The morphology
of the photoanodes
is characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM,
JEOL-6340F). The crystal structure of the samples is obtained by X-ray
diffraction (XRD) measurements using a Shimadzu thin-film X-ray diffractometer.
Grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) with an incidence angle of 3 on the
detector scan mode is performed to obtain the diffractogram from the
thin-film BiVO4 on FTO. The scan rate is 2 per minute in
0.2 increments of 2θ from 10 to 70°. The UV–vis
absorption studies are carried out by diffuse reflectance mode of
the photoanodes (Perkin Elmer).

Photoelectrochemical Characterization
Photoelectrochemical
(PEC) performances for pristine and doped BiVO4 samples
are carried out using a CHI 660D working station (CH Instruments,
Inc.) in a three-electrode configuration in which BiVO4 is used as the anode, Pt as the counter electrode, Ag/AgCl (3 M)
as the reference electrode, and 0.5 M Na2SO4 (pH = 6.8) as the electrolyte for the PEC measurements. The potential
vs 3 M Ag/AgCl is converted to RHE using the equation below 1  where 2  The working electrode surface area fixed for
the PEC measurements is 0.12 cm2. The PEC measurements
are also done in the presence of Na2SO3, which
serves as hole scavenger. The oxidation of Na2SO3 is thermodynamically and kinetically more facile and favorable than
water,27,36,37 which enables
the independent investigation of water oxidation performance of Mo-doped
BiVO4, as it rules out the poor water oxidation kinetics
of BiVO4 photoanodes. Before all of the PEC measurements,
the electrolyte is degassed by nitrogen gas for 30 min. Linear sweep
voltammograms are recorded at a scan rate 20 mV s–1 under dark and illuminated conditions. The light source used is
a 150 W xenon solar simulator (67005, Newport Corp.) equipped with
a solar filter (KG 3), with a measured intensity equivalent to the
standard AM 1.5G sunlight (100 mW cm–2) on the sample
surface. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) characteristics
are measured with a xenon light source (MAX-302, Asahi Spectra Co.
Ltd.) coupled with a monochromator (CMS-100, Asahi Spectra Co. Ltd.)
from 350 to 650 nm at a potential of 1.23 V versus RHE. A Si photodiode
(Bentham, DH-Si) with known IPCE is used to calculate the IPCE of
the pristine and doped photoanodes. A source meter (Keithley Instruments
Inc., model no. 2400) is used to measure the photocurrent of the Si
diode. An electrochemical work station (CHI 660D, CH Instruments,
Inc.) is used to measure the photocurrent of the samples. The IPCE
at each wavelength are calculated using the equation shown as 3  Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
measurements are carried out using an automated potentiostat (Metrohm-Autolab,
AUT 83285) in a three-electrode electrochemical system. The reference
and counter electrodes are the same as those used for the PEC measurements.
The EIS data under dark and illuminated conditions are extracted from
10 KHz to 0.1 1 Hz with a sinusoidal voltage perturbation of 10 mV
in amplitude at 1.23 V vs RHE to estimate the difference in charge
transfer kinetics at the metal oxide–electrolyte interface
of the pristine and doped samples. A typical Mott–Schottky
plot was extracted at a frequency of 1 kHz in 0.5 M Na2SO4.

Water-splitting photocurrent density that can
be produced by a photoanode can be represented as 4  where Jabs is
the maximum current density possible by the photoanode using the light
absorbed with a band gap of 2.2–2.4 eV. ηseparation is the photogenerated charge separation efficiency and ηcatalysis catalytic efficiency of the photoanode at the semiconductor
electrolyte interface, which provides a rough estimation of the bulk
recombination and surface recombination, respectively. When a hole
scavenger (H2O2 or Na2SO3) is used in the electrolyte, 100% catalytic efficiency is achieved,
and ηcatalysis is equal to 1.23,35,38 There fore, eq 4 becomes 5  ηseparation and ηcatalysis can be calculated by eqs 6 and 7, respectively.
The value of Jabs can be determined by
multiplying the AM 1.5G spectrum and the absorption spectra of the
samples followed by integrating over the wavelength. 6   7
