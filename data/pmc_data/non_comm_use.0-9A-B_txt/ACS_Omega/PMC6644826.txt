The
first synthesis, isolation, and characterization of permidin-2-ylidene

direct reaction with isolable six-membered N-heterocyclic carbene
or from the enetetramine, arising from dimerization of the carbene.
Furthermore, a simplified method to prepare N,N′-disubstituted
perimidinium bromide salts, precursors to 1,3-disubstituted perimidin-2-ylidene,
was achieved using ammonium bromide as a source of weak acid. Through
synthesis and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopic analysis of
a carbene-phosphinidine adduct, an interrogation of the fundamental
π-bonding ability of 1,3-diisopropylperimidin-2-ylidene revealed
this interaction to be weak and of a similar order to unsaturated
imidazol-2-ylidenes.

Introduction
N-Heterocyclic carbenes
(NHCs) are well-established supporting
ligands for metal complexes that span the periodic table. The strong
σ donation and reduced tendency to dissociate along with the
tunable steric protection provided by these ligands have resulted
in their development as important tools in organometallic chemistry
and particularly as ancillary ligands in catalyst design.1−7 In this respect, the design of NHC frameworks is a significant endeavor
because, through changes to donor properties, they affect the electronic
environment of the transition metal center and, by modification of
their structural features, they can alter the steric environment of
a metal complex. The most common NHCs in the literature have five-membered
ring architectures represented by the unsaturated 1,3-disubstituted
imidazol-2-ylidenes and the saturated analogues, 1,3-disubstituted
imidazolin-2-ylidenes. Variation and investigation of steric and electronic
features of these species have been extensively explored.8−12 Recent efforts have focused on understanding and modulating the
relative σ-and π-bondings in the M–NHC interaction.13−19

By contrast, stable versions of the six-membered heterocyclic
perimidine-based
carbenes (perimidin-2-ylidene) have been isolated for more than a
decade, yet this alternative framework is almost unexplored and only
a handful of metal complexes of Ru,20,21 Os,20 Rh,7,22−26 and Ir27,28 have been isolated and characterized. Although
no Pd complexes of these carbenes have been isolated, there are some
reports of catalytic activity from such complexes.29,30 Both experimental7,22,23,27,29,30 and computationally derived data31,32 have been used to examine the interaction of these particular carbene
scaffolds with metal centers.

The limited number of isolated
perimidin-2-ylidene metal complexes
in combination with the promise in applications in catalysis encouraged
our effort to isolate and characterize new Pd(II) complexes stabilized
by six-membered perimidine-based carbenes. As an entry point to this
chemistry, we report a simple method to prepare N,N′-disubstituted
perimidinium bromide salts, which serve as either precursors to a
persistent 1,3-disubstituted perimidin-2-ylidene or the related enetetramine,
the formal C–C bonded dimer of a carbene. Either of these species
could be employed for direct access to Pd(II) complexes of the targeted
perimidin-2-ylidene ligands and the first isolation and spectroscopic
and structural analyses of such species. Furthermore, we report on
computational analysis indicating thermodynamic favorability of dimerization
of these permidin-2-ylidenes and experimental confirmation of the
weak π-acceptor ability using spectroscopic analysis of a carbene-phosphinidine
adduct.

Results and Discussion
The original reports for the
isolation of 1,3-disubstituted perimidin-2-ylidenes
employed the deprotonation of the cationic perimidinium species such
as 1 and 2.22,23 A key complication
of this approach was that many of the perimidinium cations were obtained
with formate or tosylate counterions, and clean deprotonation first
required an anion exchange for chloride. In an effort to simplify
the preparation of perimidinium halide, we explored the replacement
of organic acids in the cyclization step with ammonium bromide, as
shown in Scheme 1.
This improved approach successfully yielded N,N′-diisopropylperimidinium bromide, C10H6(iPrN)2CH+Br–, in 77% yield. Preparation of the previously
reported benzyl-substituted perimidinium bromide, C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)CH+Br–2, was achieved by the reaction of N-isopropyl perimidine with benzyl bromide (Scheme 1).23 Synthetic details and characterization of 1 and 2 including spectroscopic analyses and single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analyses are provided in the Supporting Information. The central positively charged HCN2 moieties in 1 and 2 gave characteristic
downfield 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals at
δ 9.7 or 10.2 with associated 13C NMR signals at
δ 149.9 or 150.9, respectively. The remaining signals for the
cations appear at appropriate chemical shifts and have integration
values consistent with their formulations.

Scheme 1 Preparation of Benzyl-Substituted
Perimidinium Bromide, C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)CH+Br–2 Achieved by the Reaction of N-Isopropyl Perimidine
with Benzyl Bromide
In our hands, the deprotonation of bromide salts 1 and 2 was best achieved using KN(SiMe3)2 as a strong non-nucleophilic base (Scheme 2). As anticipated, the deprotonation
of 1 proceeded smoothly to yield the reported carbene 3.22,23 The key NMR observations for
this deprotonation
are the disappearance of the C–H signal of the central HCN2 unit in 1H NMR with concomitant loss of the associated 13C signal at δ 149.9 and appearance of a new downfield
Ccarbene signal at δ 241.7. Somewhat surprisingly,
the deprotonation of 2 was not as straightforward as
anticipated. This compound has been reported to yield 1-isopropyl-3-benzyl-perimidin-2-ylidene,
C10H6(iPrN) (C6H4CH2N)C, based on initial spectroscopic
signatures.23 However, like the related
{C10H6(cyclo-C7H13N)(p-MeC6H4CH2N)C}2, which was formed by dimerization of the
initially formed perimidin-2-ylidenes,23 the NMR spectra of the products from deprotonation of 2 suggested dimerization to form the corresponding enetetramine, {C10H6(iPrN)(C6H4CH2N)C}24. Specifically,
in the 1H NMR spectra, the original single resonance for
the benzyl CH2 group was replaced with eight doublets,
consistent with the formation of cis and trans isomers of the enetetramine
with diastereotopic protons for the CH2 moieties.

Scheme 2 Deprotonation
of Bromide Salts 1 and 2 Achieved
Using KN(SiMe3)2 as a Strong Non-Nucleophilic
Base
Fortunately, crystals of one
of the isomers of compound 4 were obtained, and single-crystal
X-ray analysis established the
proposed dimerization. A structural diagram of the transisomer for
{C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C}24 is presented in Figure 1 with selected crystallographic data provided
in Table 1. These results
revealed a molecule with a central C=C bond located on an inversion
center, with a C11–C11′ linkage that displayed a bond
length of 1.333(3) Å, a value similar to the reported analogue trans-{C10H6(cyclo-C7H13N)(p-MeC6H4CH2N)C}2 with a C=C distance
of 1.348(4) Å.23 The two halves of
the molecule are slightly twisted along this C=C axis with
an N1–C11–C11′–N2′ angle of 6.47°.
Furthermore, the six-membered heterocycles are not planar. The N1
and N2 centers displayed different geometries with N1 being planar
(∑ angles 358°), whereas N2 is pyramidal (∑ angles
337°). As a result the iPr substituents
on N2 centers project out of the central C2N4 plane. The C11–N1 and C11–N2 bond lengths [1.419(2)
and 1.432(2) Å] are increased compared to those of the perimidinium
starting material 2 [1.318(3) and 1.316(3) Å], indicating
that the formation of the C11–C11′ π bond has
led to a reduced degree of C–N π-bonding compared to
the starting material C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)CH+Br 2.

The dimerization of N-stabilized carbenes has been
reviewed and
rationalized in terms of thermodynamic values for the C=C bond
formation and steric protection provided by the N-substituents. A
simple comparison of the computed singlet-triplet energy gap (ES/T) with an estimated value for the C=C
bond energy provides a thermodynamic model that can be used to rationalize
the dimerization of the carbene.33−38 Essentially, if the value of ES/T for
two carbenes is less than the energy released from the formation of
the C=C double bond, estimated at 172 kcal/mol, the dimerization
product is favored. In the case of perimidin-2-ylidene C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C, a density
functional optimization optimization of both the singlet and triplet
model species was computed using the B3LYP functional and the TZVP
basis set, and this calculation yielded an ES/T of 57.7 kcal/mol. Thus, the energy released on C=C
bond formation minus the ES/T for two
carbene units yields approximately 56.6 kcal/mol as the energy that
could be gained by forming the dimer, {C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C}24. The more subtle role of steric protection in this dimerization
is shown by the comparison of the structures of free carbene 3 and enetetramine 4. In spite of a smaller computed
ES/T for monomeric 3 (B3LYP, TZVP) of 54.8
kcal/mol, simply replacing a benzyl substituent with an isopropyl
group favors isolation of the free monomeric carbene. These observations
are closely parallel to the reported result for related carbene/enetetramine
species.23

In addition to knowledge
of ES/T, the
σ-donor/π-acceptor ability of NHCs is a fundamental feature
that is key for their application in organometallic chemistry and
catalysis. A common method for accessing the donor ability of a ligand,
and a carbene specifically, is through the Tolman electronic parameter
(TEP),39 and the donor abilities of perimidin-2-ylidenes
have been analyzed using the TEP.7,23,26 Two recent reports have proposed a means of assessing
the π-acceptor ability of NHCs through NMR-based analysis of
either C–P or C–Se bonding.40,41 For example, 31P NMR chemical shifts of easily synthesized
carbene-phenylphosphinidene adducts provided a correlation of relative
π-acceptor properties of NHCs. The π-acceptor ability
of perimidine-2-ylidenes has not been investigated by this method,
and therefore, we carried out the synthesis of phenylphosphinidene
species 5, as depicted in Scheme 3. Compound 5 gave a 31P NMR shift of −53.5 ppm, and this high field shift was typical
of reported phosphinidenes formed from unsaturated imidazol-2-ylidenes,
indicative of an electron-rich phosphorus center and a low degree
of P–C π-bonding. Furthermore, the room-temperature 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 5 displayed
sharp symmetrical features that suggested that the P–Ph group
was freely rotating relative to the CN2 plane of the carbene
fragment and providing additional evidence of rather weak P–C
π-bonding.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Phenylphosphinidene Species 5
Given the limited application
of perimidine-based carbenes as ligands,
the broad application of Pd(II) complexes in catalysis, and the preliminary
reports of in situ generated permidine-2-ylidene/Pd(II) catalysts,29,30 we explored the organometallic chemistry of Pd(OAc)2 complexes
bearing carbene ligands derived from 1 and 2. With ready access to carbene 3 via simple deprotonation,
the direct reaction of 2 equivalents of 3 with Pd(OAc)2 (Scheme 4)
was used to successfully obtain the bis(carbene) Pd(II) species [C10H6(iPrN)2C]2Pd(OAc)26. Both 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies as well as high-resolution
mass spectroscopy (HRMS) provided convincing evidence for our formulation
of 6. The NMR spectra indicated a symmetrical structure
with a 1:1 ratio of carbene and acetate ligands. Additionally, the 13C NMR spectra gave a resonance assigned to the carbene carbon
center at δ 197.3, which was shifted downfield from the free
carbene 3, as evidence of successful ligand coordination.
An additional key indication for coordinated carbene came from the
observation in the 1H NMR spectrum of a large change in
the chemical shift for the C–H septet of the iPr groups from 4.08 ppm in free 3 to 8.34 ppm
in 6. Similar changes in the chemical shift have been
noted for perimidine-based carbenes coordinated to Rh(I) complexes.22,23 The observation of a downfield 1H NMR shift for CH protons
experiencing axial M···H–C contacts with square-planar
transition-metal d8 complexes was first reported in 1967
for a Ni(II) complex and has remained an active area of investigation.42 The observation that the iPr methyne protons display a deshielding of 4.26 ppm is consistent
with the exceptional downfield shifts for analogous interactions appearing
in recent reports and strongly suggest that these protons are positioned
above and below the PdL4 plane.43−47 Recently, an elegant combination of experimental
and computational analysis has been used to reveal the more intimate
details of such interactions.48,49

Scheme 4 Direct Reactions
of either Carbene 3 or Enetetramine 4 with Pd(OAc)2 to Successfully Obtain the Bis(carbene)
Pd(II) Species, [C10H6(iPrN)2C]2Pd(OAc)26
Single crystals of 6 were obtained from toluene and
provided, through X-ray analysis, definite confirmation for the connectivity
of 6. The results of this analysis are presented in Figure 2 with a summary of
selected bonding parameters in Table 2. These results showed that 6 displayed
a pseudo-square planar, divalent palladium center, Pd1, with transcoordinated
acetate and carbene ligands. As expected for a planar metal coordination
geometry, the interligand angles sum to 360°. The Pd–Ccarbene distance of 2.064(2) Å is similar to literature
values found for square planar Pd(II)–NHC complexes.50,51 Within the coordinated carbene ligand, the average N–Ccarbene bond length became slightly shorter compared
to the free carbene species.22 This feature
is consistent with the concept that the carbene does not participate
in significant Pd–Ccarbene π-bonding. The
two coordinated carbene ligands are coplanar, with these planes approximately
perpendicular to the Pd pseudo-square planar coordination (dihedral
angle of PdO2C2 and N1–C11–N2
= 85.7°). This carbene ligand arrangement positions the isopropyl
CH moieties directly above and below the planar Pd(II) center, which
is entirely consistent with the observed strong deshielding of these
protons in the 1H NMR spectra of 6.

Because our attempts to generate a free carbene ligand
via deprotonation
of 2 led only to isolation of enetetramine 4, we chose to investigate the viability of using 4 as
the precursor for a Pd-coordinated 1-isopropyl-3-benzyl-perimidin-2-ylidene,
C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C
ligand. The use of enetetramines in the synthesis of metal–carbene
complexes has been reviewed,52,53 and we have previously
employed this approach to prepare a Rh(I) complex of perimidin-2-ylidene
C[N(3,5-Me)C6H3]2C10H6 with 3,5-dimethyl phenyl substituents.54 Fortunately, the analogous synthetic procedure employing
direct reaction of 4 and Pd(OAc)2 provided
the successful isolation of [C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C]2Pd(OAc)27.

The NMR data for 7 was analogous to 6, which provided a clear indication for the formation of
the trans-diacetatobis(carbene)Pd(II) complex, [C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C]2Pd(OAc)2. Perhaps the clearest indication of success in isolation
of this
species was the observation that the septet resonance for the isopropyl
CH proton was deshielded by 4.32 ppm compared to the enetetramine
starting material 2 and appeared at δ 7.82. Additionally,
the benzyl CH2 resonance of 7 also exhibited
a similar deshielding effect and was observed at δ 7.45.

Single crystals of 7 were obtained, and their X-ray
analysis confirmed the identity and connectivity of 7, as shown in Figure 3. Structural features including the metal coordination geometry and
the relative orientation of the coordinated ligands were analogous
to 6 (Table 2). For example, the Pd–Ccarbene (C11) bond
distance was 2.061(2) Å, the carbene ligands were coplanar, and
the sum of the four interligand angles around the Pd center was 360°,
consistent with a square planar coordination geometry.

For clarity, only selected atoms are shown as thermal ellipsoids and
labelled. The remaining carbon and oxygen atoms are rendered in wire
frame. Hydrogen atoms have been omitted.

This first successful synthesis, isolation, and characterization
of permidin-2-ylidene complexes of Pd(II) complexes is a significant
addition to the coordination chemistry of these ligands and encourages
further exploration and application of these carbenes, which are captured
in a unique molecular architecture. We documented that both direct
reaction with the isolated carbene and cleavage of enetetramine, the
dimer of permidin-2-ylidene, presented routes to the Pd complex synthesis.
The accessibility and use of this family of carbenes is further strengthened
by the report of using ammonium ion as a weak acid in the generation
of the carbene precursor because this avoids issues that previously
arose from the use of organic acids. Additional fundamental characteristics
of permidin-2-ylidines such as the critical role of steric protection,
provided by the N-R substituents, in prohibiting the thermodynamically
favored carbene dimerization and the weak π-acceptor nature
of these ligands supported through structural and spectroscopic analyses
have also been provided. With all of these features in mind and the
extensive literature on the use of Pd–NHCs in catalytic reactions,
our future studies will explore the catalytic potential of these complexes.

Experimental
Section
Unless otherwise noted, all manipulations are carried
out in either
a nitrogen-filled glovebox or under nitrogen using standard Schlenk
techniques. Reaction solvents were sparged with nitrogen and then
dried by passage through a column of activated alumina using an apparatus
purchased from Anhydrous Engineering. Deuterated benzene and chloroform
and toluene were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company. Acetone,
benzyl bromide, 1,8-diaminonaphthalene, formic acid, LiAlH4, MeLi, KN(SiMe3)2, triethylorthoformate, and
Pd(OAc)2 were purchased from Aldrich Chemical Company and
used without further purification. 1-Isopropylperimidine, C10H6N(iPrN)CH, 1-isopropyl-3-benzylperimidinium
bromide, 2, and 1,3-isopropylperimidine-2-ylidene, 3, were prepared by literature methods.22,54

1H spectra were run on either a Bruker 300, 400,
or
600 MHz spectrometer, and 13C{1H} NMR spectra
were run on either a Bruker 75, 100, or 150 MHz spectrometer using
the residual protons of the deuterated solvent for reference. Elemental
analyses were performed by Midwest Micro lab in Indianapolis, IN,
USA. High-resolution lock mass accuracy mass spectrometry was conducted
on an electrospray global quadrupole time-of-flight spectrometer at
the John L Holmes Mass Spectrometry Facility at the University of
Ottawa.

Crystallographic Analysis
Crystals were mounted on
thin glass fibers using Parabar 10312 cryoprotectant. Prior to data
collection, the crystals were cooled to 200(2) K. The data were collected
on a Bruker AXS single-crystal diffractometer equipped with a sealed
Mo tube (wavelength 0.71073 Å) and an APEX II CCD detector. The
raw data collection and reduction were done with the Bruker APEX II
software package.55 Semiempirical absorption
corrections based on equivalent reflections were applied using TWINABS56 for 1 and SADABS57 for other datasets. Systematic absences in the diffraction
dataset and unit-cell parameter were consistent with the assigned
space groups. The structures were solved by direct methods and refined
with full-matrix least-squares procedures based on F2, using SHELXL58 and WinGX.59 All non-H atoms were refined anisotropically.
All hydrogen atoms were placed in idealized positions.

The crystal
of 1 was twinned and the refinement was done over two
domains using HKLF5 data. The ratio of the domains is 0.68:0.32. The
sum of the occupancies for Br anions was constrained to two and after
refinement gave 0.895(3), 0.877(4), 0.149(4), and 0.080(4) for Br(1),
Br(2), Br(3), and Br(4), respectively. Enhanced rigid-bond restraints
(RIGU) were applied to all atoms. Other restraints were not used.
No additional restraints or constraints were used for 2 and 7.

In 4, all molecules are lying
on inversion centers
with the asymmetric unit consisting of two half molecules. One of
the isopropyl groups C(41)–C(40)–C(42) is disordered
over two positions with 0.60(1):0.40(1) occupancy ratio. It was refined
using bond length and angle restraints (SADI and SAME) and restraints
on the atomic displacement parameters (SIMU and RIGU).

Structure 6 shows substitutional disorder of acetate
and bromide anions with 0.917(3):0.083(3) occupancy ratio. The compound
crystallized with two tetrahydrofuran (THF) solvate molecules per
one complex. The THF molecule is disordered over two positions with
0.725(7):0.275(7) occupancy ratio. The resulting formula corresponded
to (C17H20N2)2(CH3COO)1.84Br0.16Pd (C4H8O)2.

Preparation of Enetetramine 4, {C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C}2
Compound 2 (0.50 g, 1.3 mmol) was dissolved
in 15 mL
of 1:1 chlorobenzene/THF in a glovebox. To this solution was added
K[N(SiMe3)2] (0.26 g, 1.3 mmol) dissolved in
5 mL of 1:1 chlorobenzene/THF. The reaction mixture was stirred for
1 h, and the solvent was removed under vacuum. The resulting pale
brown viscous liquid was extracted with toluene, followed by solvent
removal under vacuum to yield 4 (0.35 g, 0.58 mmol, 45%).

Preparation of Phenylphosphinidene C10H6(iPrN)2C=PC6H5 (5)
Dichlorophenylphosphine (0.179
g, 1.00 mmol) was added to a solution of carbene 3 (0.252
g, 1.00 mmol) in pentane (10 mL) at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled
glovebox. A yellow solid precipitated immediately. The mixture was
stirred overnight and filtered in the glovebox. The solids were washed
with diethyl ether and dried under reduced pressure. In a glovebox,
the solids were combined in a reaction flask with magnesium (0.048
g, 2.00 mmol) and 10 mL of THF. The mixture was then stirred at room
temperature overnight, and the volatiles were removed. The product
was extracted with benzene, filtered, and the volatiles were removed
under reduced pressure. The final compound was obtained as an orange
solid; yield 69% (0.248 g, 0.69 mmol).

Preparation of {C10H6(iPrN)2C}2Pd(OAc)2 (6)
In a nitrogen-filled
glovebox, a vial was charged with
Pd(OAc)2 (0.090 g, 0.4 mmol), 10 mL of THF, and a stir
bar. To this solution, carbene 3 (0.099 g, 0.4 mmol)
predissolved in 10 mL of toluene was added dropwise. During the addition,
the reaction solution turned into brown color. The reaction was stirred
overnight at room temperature; then, the volume of the solvent was
removed under vacuum and cooled to −25 °C to give colorless
crystals of 6 (0.140 g, 48% yield).

Preparation of {C10H6(iPrN)(BnN)C}2Pd(OAc)2 (7)
In a nitrogen-filled glovebox, a vial was charged with Pd(OAc)2 (0.056 g, 0.25 mmol), 10 mL of THF, and a stir bar. To this
solution, enetetramine 4 (0.076 g, 0.25 mmol) predissolved
in 10 mL of toluene was added dropwise. During the addition, the solution
turned into dark brown color. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight
at room temperature; then, the solvent was removed under vacuum and
cooled to −25 °C to give colorless crystals of 7 (0.129 g, 68% yield).

1H NMR (C6D6, 300 MHz): δ 7.82 (sept, 2H, CHMe2, J = 7.0 Hz), 7.45 (d, 4H, CH2, J = 7.3 Hz), 6.73–7.07 (m,
