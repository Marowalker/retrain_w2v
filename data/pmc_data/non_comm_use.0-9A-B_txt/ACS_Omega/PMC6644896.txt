Quinalizarin
(THAQ), a hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone analogue of the
family of anthracycline anticancer drugs and an inhibitor of protein
kinase, was observed for its anticancer activity. Because apart from
showing anticancer activity, anthracyclines and their analogues also
show cardiotoxic side effects, believed to be addressed through metal
complex formation; an effort was made to realize this by preparing
a CoII complex of THAQ. The aim of this study was to find
out if complex formation leads to a decrease in the generation of
intermediates that are responsible for toxic side effects. However,
because this also meant that efficacy on cancer cells would be compromised,
studies were undertaken on two cancer cell lines, namely, acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (ALL) MOLT-4 and HCT116 cells. The complex decreases the
flow of electrons from NADH to molecular oxygen (O2) in
the presence of NADH dehydrogenase forming less semiquinone than THAQ.
It showed increased affinity toward DNA with binding constant values
remaining constant over the physiological pH range unlike THAQ (for
which decrease in binding constant values with increase in pH was
observed). The complex is probably a human DNA topoisomerase I and
human DNA topoisomerase II poison acting by stabilizing the covalent
topoisomerase-cleaved DNA adduct, a phenomenon not observed for THAQ.
Activity of the compounds on cancer cells suggests that THAQ was more
effective on ALL MOLT-4 cells, whereas the complex performed better
on HCT116 cells. Results suggest that the formation of semiquinone
probably dominates the action because of THAQ, whereas the performance
of the complex is attributed to increased DNA binding, inhibition
of topoisomerase, and so forth. Inspite of a decrease in the generation
of superoxide by the complex, it did not hamper efficacy on either
cell line, probably compensated by improved DNA binding and inhibition
of topoisomerase enzymes which are positive attributes of complex
formation. A decrease in superoxide formation suggests that the complex
could be less cardiotoxic, thus increasing its therapeutic index.

Introduction
Anthracyclines disrupt
complex biological processes in their effort
to be effective anticancer agents.1−3 An important attribute
of the molecules is their ability to interfere with human DNA topoisomerase
I and human DNA topoisomerase II; enzymes that are intricately involved
with DNA replication. Because anthracyclines are known to bind DNA
through intercalation, it is important to understand the interactions
that occur within cells.4−11 The planar hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone aglycon intercalates base
pairs of DNA, whereas the amino sugar interacts with negatively charged
phosphates in DNA major groove.3,11 Intercalation brings
about a change in the DNA double helix, affecting crucial cellular
processes.1−3,11 Efficacy of anthracyclines
is also attributed to their ability to generate reactive free radicals.
Growing evidence shows in vivo formation of semiquinone by one-electron
reduction of the quinone that leads to a sequence of events important
from a therapeutic point of view.12−15 The formation of reactive intermediates
is also responsible for dose-related cardiotoxicity.3,11−15 Therefore, it is necessary to strike a balance between therapeutic
efficacy and toxic side effects with regard to the generation of these
reactive intermediates.16,17 Research has revealed
that metal complexes of anthracyclines modulate the formation of semiquinone
that helps to control cardiotoxicity.18−20 However, in controlling
the formation of semiquinone through complex formation in an attempt
to check cardiotoxicity, efficacy of the molecule is often compromised.

Two most popular drugs of the anthracycline family are daunomycin
and adriamycin, natural products isolated from Streptomyces
peucetius var. caesius that are in use for over five
decades.2,21 They are potent pharmaceutical ingredients
requiring special care during production, isolation, and purification,
making them very costly.22,23 Hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones
present at the core of anthracyclines and essential for drug action
would therefore be worth trying, to see if a hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone
on its own or as a metal complex shows efficacy comparable to anthracyclines.1−3,12−15,22−27 Because slight variations in the location of hydroxy groups on an
anthraquinone moiety of an anthracycline manifest in different ways
in drug action, hence if different hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones were
investigated, they could help to identify and correlate a possible
role for different hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone units in these drug
molecules.28 This would enable us to achieve
similar objectives using simpler molecules that are also less costly
than anthracyclines.22−30

Carminomycin (Top) and Nogalamycin
We chose quinalizarin
(THAQ) for its close similarity to anthracyclines
such as carminomycin and nogalamycin. Besides, it has an ability to
inhibit protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase 2);31,32 CK2 exerts an antiapoptotic role by protecting regulatory proteins
from caspase-mediated degradation, essential for cell viability.33 Hence, we thought that THAQ could be an interesting
starting point for investigating the role of hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones
because it already possesses certain attributes that are established
with the help of biological investigations.32−34 A CoII complex was prepared to see the extent to which the activity of
THAQ improved when bound to CoII in the complex and the
extent to which it resembles similar complexes of anthracyclines.35

Results and Discussion
Physicochemical Studies
on the Interaction of CoII with THAQ
Stoichiometry of Complex
Formation by Mole Ratio and Job’s
Method
The composition of the complex was determined by mixing
different volumes of equimolar CoII and THAQ. In the mole
ratio method (Figure 1a), the concentration of CoII was fixed, whereas that
of THAQ was varied. Absorbance at 550 nm was plotted against (TL/TM)TM, and TM and TL are the concentrations of CoII and
THAQ, respectively. Intersection of two lines indicates the ratio
at which THAQ binds CoII. In Job’s method of continuous
variation (Figure 1b), complementary mixtures were prepared and the absorbance was recorded
at 550 nm. This was plotted against volumes of THAQ or CoII. Stoichiometry of CoII to THAQ was found to be 1:2.

Figure 1 Plots
showing gradual variation in absorbance at 550 nm for (a)
change in [THAQ]/[CoII] at a fixed concentration of CoII = 10 μM and (b) continuous variation of THAQ and CoII at physiological pH (∼7.4). For (b), strength of
stock solutions of CoII and THAQ was 100 μM; each
taken in a specific amount and diluted; [NaCl] = 10 mM, Temp. = 298
K.

Proton Dissociation of
THAQ In the Presence of CoII
THAQ and CoII were mixed in the ratio determined
by mole ratio and Job’s method. A spectrophotometric titration
was performed in the pH range 3.0–11.0 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Change in absorbance
of THAQ at 560 nm in the presence of CoII was fitted to eq 1 (Figure 2). 1  pK1 and pK2 were 4.77 ±
0.15 and 10.25 ± 0.05,
respectively. Stability constant was determined using eqs S1–S5
(Supporting Information) and found to be
3.3 × 1019 (log β = 19.52).

= 10 mM, T = 301 K.

Characterization of CoII(THAQ)2
UV–Vis
Spectra of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2
The
spectrum of the complex was recorded in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO), showing a peak at 554 nm. A slight red shift was
observed in comparison to THAQ (taken in the aqueous medium, Figure
S2, Supporting Information). λmax for the complex appeared in the same range of wavelength
as that used for physicochemical experiments involving CoII and THAQ, suggesting that the prepared complex was similar to species
that were formed during experiments performed in connection with the
determination of stoichiometry.

IR of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2
Infrared
(IR) spectrum of THAQ revealed a sharp peak because of the stretching
of phenolic-OH at 3379 cm–1 (Figure S3, Supporting Information) that changed to a broad
band at 3434 cm–1 in the complex (Figure S4, Supporting Information).36 Carbonyl stretching frequencies for THAQ at 1615 and 1581 cm–1 transformed to a broad peak at 1632 cm–1 in the complex. Peaks in the region from 1458 to 1093 cm–1 in the IR spectrum of THAQ (−OH and −CH bending) also
underwent significant changes in the complex.

Mass Spectrum
of the Complex
Mass spectra (MS) of the
complex were recorded using two independent techniques (ESI+ and EI+). Combination of the two (Figure S5a,b, Supporting Information) helped to identify the
molecular ion peak at m/z = 601.35.
The peak at m/z = 553.36 was assigned
to a fragment formed from the molecular ion, following loss of three
−OH groups.

Magnetic Moment of CoII(THAQ)2
Magnetic susceptibility was measured by the Gouy
method, and μeff was found to be 3.46 BM.

Electron
Paramagnetic Resonance Spectroscopy
Electron
paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy measurement of the complex
was done both in the solid state and in the DMF–ethanol mixture.
The spectrum (Figure S6, Supporting Information) was assigned to high-spin (S = 3/2) CoII. The line width broadening observed in the spectrum was the result
of an interaction with neighboring CoII ions as well as
the outcome of recording the spectrum at room temperature.37−39 An idea regarding a possible coordination around the metal center
was obtained by comparing our spectrum with those reported earlier
for similar CoII complexes of adriamycin containing the
hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone unit or that of 1,4-dihydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone
(quinizarin).35−39 The EPR spectrum of the CoII complex of quinizarin served
as an important reference for our purpose.37

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) suggests that the complex is stable up to 300 °C (Figure
S7, Supporting Information).

On the Structure
of the Complex
Single crystals of
metal complexes of hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones are rare with only
one structure reported so far from single-crystal data.40 Through previous work, we reported three structures
of metal complexes of hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones (purpurin and emodin)
from powder diffraction data.10,41,42 Attempts were made to obtain single crystals of the CoII complex as well but we were not successful. We tried obtaining the
structure from powder diffraction data but failed. Although the substance
showed a reasonably clean powder diffraction data with distinctly
different peaks for the complex, compared to that of the ligand, lack
of peaks at low angles prevented us from arriving at a structure like
we did earlier. Attempted calculations were not converging. Hence,
we tried to arrive at the structure of the complex from the information
obtained from other techniques, either in solid state or in solution.
Emphasis was given to the analysis of mass spectrum data, information
obtained from EPR and TGA. Using some of the instrument-based evidence,
data obtained from physicochemical experiments such as pKa and so forth and considering previous reports, a geometry optimization
was attempted to arrive at a probable structure of the CoII–THAQ complex.35−39 Similar to that reported earlier for CoII complexes of
the drug adriamycin and CoII complexes of quinizarin (another
hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone), our complex was believed to have tetragonal
coordination because EPR characteristics obtained were similar to
those reported earlier.37−39 Spectral features with broad
signals resemble those for complexes with tetragonal coordination
for CoII complexes of 3-formylsalicylic acid-R(NH2)2 Schiff bases.43 The broad
signals could be due to the complex having a tetragonal coordination
structure as observed in DMF–ethanol.

THAQ has a planar
geometry. The thermal analysis plot (TGA pattern) does not indicate
the presence of any coordinated or even guest water molecules. Therefore,
the possibility of the CoII complex having an octahedral
geometry is ruled out. Hence, two possibilities that remain based
on the experimental evidence are either tetrahedral or square planar
coordination. Literature survey suggests when a metal ion has d7 configuration and binds to strong field ligands, it forms
a square planar architecture but when coordinated to weak field ligands
shows tetrahedral coordination. CobaltII in a THAQ complex
has a d7 configuration. When THAQ binds CoII, one attachment is through the C=O group having vacant π*
orbitals capable of participating in back donation at the site of
coordination. Hence, it might act as a mildly strong field ligand
and probably not too strong either. We considered two model structures
for CoII(THAQ)2. In the first, CoII was considered to be coordinated by two THAQs in a tetrahedral arrangement
and in another (the second model), coordination environment was considered
square planar. We then performed geometry optimization in the gaseous
state using Gaussian 09 package and the very basic semiempirical method
with unrestricted PM6 basis set to investigate which one of the two
structures was lower in energy in their respective ground states,
assuming that the lower energy configuration tends to give the more
favored structure.44 The first model failed
to converge even after running a sufficiently large number of cycles.
It could not generate any output. However, the second model provided
an optimized geometry with energy −15.2075 eV for the ground
state with no imaginary frequencies. The optimized geometry is presented
in Figure 3 with a
few selected bond lengths and bond angles listed in Table 1. The optimized geometry shows
the metal center coordinated in a square planar fashion.

C14–O16	1.299	C26–O32–Co17	125.33	
Although two THAQ ligands
are parallel to each other, they are
however not in the same plane (geometry optimized structure in the Supporting Information). It may be seen in the
geometry optimized structure (Supporting Information) that the angles made by the ligating O atoms of THAQ with CoII are not perfectly 90°. While two of them are ∼93°
and 94°, the other two are ∼88°. Therefore, a slight
distortion is present even in square planar geometry. Keeping in mind
the aspect of vacant π* orbitals of the coordinating C=O
group and a possibility for back donation at the site of coordination,
there is developed a tendency to form a square planar configuration
rather than tetrahedral or a structure in between the two; hence,
a distortion was obtained in square planar geometry as well.

Similar calculations were performed for geometry computed in DMSO
solvent simulated by a conductor-like polarizable continuum model
(CPCM). The UV–vis transition of the complex was computed by
a single-point calculation carried out using a time-dependent density
functional theory method starting with the ground state geometry optimized
in DMSO media. Unrestricted Becke’s three-parameter hybrid
functional and Lee–Yang–Parr’s gradient-corrected
correlation functional (UB3LYP) along with 6-311+G(d,p) basis set
were adopted for C, H, and O. For Co, we chose the LanL2DZ basis set.
Excitation energies computed in the DMSO solvent simulated by the
CPCM were determined by using the nonequilibrium approach that was
designed for the study of the absorption processes. Only singlet–singlet
transitions, that are spin-allowed transitions, were taken into account.
The theoretical UV–vis spectrum of the complex obtained in
DMSO is shown in Figure S8. It has very
close similarity to the experimentally obtained UV–vis spectrum
of the complex in DMSO (Figure S2) and
with the spectra obtained in aqueous solution when pH metric titration
of THAQ was attempted in the presence of Co(II) (Figure S1). This information further supports that the geometry
of the complex is square planar with minor distortions.

Interaction
of CoII(THAQ)2 with Calf Thymus
DNA
Using UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The complex (50 μM)
was titrated with calf thymus DNA to saturation. A decrease in absorbance
at 550 nm at pH 7.4 was attributed to intercalation between base pairs
of DNA (Figure 4).25−29 Similar titrations were performed at pH 6.8 and 8.2. Figure S9 is a typical double reciprocal plot
obeying eq 3. Figure 5 is a plot of ΔA/ΔAmax against concentration
of DNA fitted by nonlinear square fit analysis (eqs 4 and 5) for a titration
performed at pH 6.8. Similar nonlinear fitting was done for titrations
performed at other pH values. Values for Kapp are summarized in Table 2. The inset of Figure 5 shows determination of nb (Table 2). Overall binding
constant values (K′) were obtained by multiplying Kapp with nb for
all titrations performed at different pHs (Table 2).

Data
from the titrations at three different pHs were also analyzed
according to the modified form of the Scatchard equation (eq 6), providing values for
overall binding constant (K′) and n (=nb–1).45 A typical Scatchard plot for the complex at
pH 8.2 is shown in Figure 6. Results of similar plots at other pH are summarized in Table 2. An interesting observation
made from the study on DNA binding with regard to evaluation of site
size (nb) for CoII(THAQ)2 binding to calf thymus DNA was that the value was almost
double that obtained for THAQ itself binding to DNA. This serves as
yet another evidence that two molecules of THAQ are bound to CoII in the complex.26−28

Figure 6 Scatchard plot for the interaction of
CoII(THAQ)2 with calf thymus DNA. [CoII(THAQ)2]
= 50 μM, [NaCl] = 120 mM, pH = 8.2, temperature = 301 K.

Data obtained at all three pHs
were analyzed using eq 7. Apparent and overall binding constants
were evaluated (Table 2). Figure S10 is a typical plot obtained
by fitting the titration data to eq 7 at pH 8.2. Binding constant and site size of interaction
(nb) for the complex interacting with
DNA evaluated from different approaches not only corroborate each
other but also indicate that they are higher than THAQ.25 Unlike THAQ, binding constant values for the
complex did not decrease with the increase in the pH of the medium.29 This is significant for it indicates that complex
formation is able to prevent the generation of anionic species on
THAQ at physiological pH which was responsible for the decrease in
binding constant values for THAQ interacting with DNA at high pH.29 The result is significant from a biological
point of view as well because cancer patients show fluctuation of
pH in body fluids, a matter of concern regarding the application of
several drugs.46 Therefore, if this complex
is ever developed into a drug, it may be expected that its activity
based on DNA interaction would remain more or less same over a considerable
range of pH, an improvement over THAQ.

Figure 7 relates
the ratio of input drug/DNA (ri) to the
ratio of bound drug/DNA (rb) as derived
from Scatchard calculations.45,47 For such a plot, a
45° line suggests that the entire compound present was bound
to DNA.47 Plots obtained at all three pHs
were close to each other, suggesting once again that binding of CoII(THAQ)2 to calf thymus DNA is not much influenced
by pH.

in absorbance, following interaction of CoII(THAQ)2 with calf thymus DNA at pH 7.4 in a medium having 120 mM
NaCl.

Using Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Binding constant and
site size of interaction of the complex were also determined using
fluorescence spectroscopy (Figure 8) at pH 7.4. The data was analyzed using eqs 2–6. A double reciprocal
plot (Figure S11) yields values for Kapp and ΔFmax. Nonlinear square fit analysis (Figure S12) provides another value for Kapp (Table 2). The data were analyzed
according to the modified Scatchard equation [eq 6] and Figure S13 (Supporting Information) and fitted to eq 7 (Figure S14). Overall binding
constant (K′) and site size (n) were determined (Table 2).

= 7.4, T = 298 K.

NADH Dehydrogenase Assay
Formation
of superoxide radical
anion catalyzed by THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 was
measured from reduction of cytochrome c inhibited
by superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the presence of NADH and NADH dehydrogenase
(Figure 9).19,24,48−50 In such enzyme-assisted
reactions, superoxide radical anions are produced when semiquinone
radical anions are oxidized by molecular oxygen. Owing to complex
formation, because one of the carbonyls of THAQ is engaged in coordinating
CoII, it is only at the other carbonyl that a semiquinone
can form explaining why a decrease is observed following complex formation.
This gets manifested as decreased superoxide formation (Figure 9). Even when the semiquinone
radical anion forms at the free carbonyl of one of the two bound THAQ
molecules, the metal ion present in the complex is quick to withdraw
the electron toward itself by more than one mechanism further decreasing
the possibility of CoII(THAQ)2 existing as CoII(THAQ) (THAQ•–).51

Figure 9 Effect of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 on superoxide
formation by NADH dehydrogenase. Superoxide formation was determined
with the help of a spectrophotometer as rate of SOD-inhibitable cytochrome c reduction. The reaction mixture contained 100 mM (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid) (HEPES) buffer (pH 7.2), 80.0 μM cytochrome c, 157.5 μM NADH, 3 U L–1 NADH dehydrogenase,
0 or 40.0 μg mL–1 SOD, and the indicated amount
of compound [▲, THAQ; ●, CoII(THAQ)2].

Hence, there is substantial decrease
in the possibility of interaction
of a semiquinone formed on the complex with molecular oxygen justifying
low yields of superoxide (Figure 9). Information available in the literature suggests
when anthracyclines are complexed with metal ions, they decrease semiquinone
formation and that most complexes have reduced cardiotoxic side effects.4,19,20,52,53 Working with hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones
and their complexes with 3d transition-metal ions, we too observed
a substantial decrease in semiquinone formation.42,54 In the case of some iron complexes, however, or for situations of
iron overload, there is an increase in semiquinone formation for which
the reason is completely different.53−55 Because THAQ closely
resembles the core of anthracyclines that are responsible for the
generation of semiquinone or superoxide, hence like that reported
for complexes of anthracyclines, complexes of hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinones,
say THAQ, should also show decreased cardiotoxic side effects if tried
in cancer chemotherapy.3,12−15,18−20 Metal ions such as Fe(III) and Cu(II) having a stable
lower oxidation state, complexes are both an efficient O2•– quencher and effective cytotoxic agents
owing to their ability to form •OH [details in the Supporting Information].53−57 However, for the CoII complex of THAQ,
CoI not being that much stable, mechanism leading to the
generation of •OH is unlikely. Therefore, the probability
of the CoII complex acting as a cytotoxic agent making
use of the redox mechanism is not very high.

In Vitro
Activity of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 on Human DNA
Topoisomerase Enzymes
The inhibitory effect
of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 was studied with the
help of a DNA relaxation assay on recombinant human DNA topoisomerase
enzymes in the absence and presence of the compounds. A relaxation
assay such as this is based on the fact that supercoiled DNA molecules
are relaxed by active topoisomerases, leading to the formation of
topoisomers of relaxed DNA. These topoisomers migrate slowly compared
to supercoiled plasmid DNA in agarose gel. Hence, the activity of
topoisomerase may be checked by observing gel bands for relaxed topoisomers.
When the topoisomerase is somehow inhibited, bands for relaxed topoisomers
do not appear on the gel. In our case, we found that at concentrations
of 10 or 20 μM, both THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 were unable to influence or inhibit the action of either human DNA
topoisomerase I or human DNA topoisomerase II as realized from their
relaxation activities. However, at a concentration of 30 μM,
inhibition due to CoII(THAQ)2 sets in, whereas
no inhibition was observed for THAQ. At 40 μM, CoII(THAQ)2 completely inhibits human DNA topoisomerase I
and human DNA topoisomerase II relaxation activities with THAQ still
not showing any effect (Figure 10a,b). Role of aqueous CoII taken in the
form of CoCl2 was also checked to find out if it might
be responsible for inhibiting either human DNA topoisomerase I or
human DNA topoisomerase II. Experiments reveal neither aqueous CoII nor THAQ had any inhibitory effect on the topoisomerase
enzymes up to 40 μM (Figure 10a,b). It may therefore be said with a lot of certainty
that the complex poisons the enzymes by stabilizing a covalent enzyme-DNA
adduct, trapping the enzyme in a DNA-linked condition, being an attribute
of complex formation.

Inhibitory effects were also checked for migration of substrate
DNA using standard compounds such as CPT (a control for topoisomerase
I inhibition) and DOX (a control for topoisomerase II inhibition)
at two different concentrations (Figure 10a,b). These showed no DNA migration, indicating
complete inhibition of the respective topoisomerase enzymes. kDNA
decatenation assay for DNA topoisomerase II in the presence and absence
of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 showed that the complex
inhibits decatenation activity of human DNA topoisomerase II at 40
μM, whereas THAQ had no effect. Although the active concentration
for CoII(THAQ)2 was much higher than CPT and
DOX, experimental evidence suggest that CoII(THAQ)2 is a potent dual inhibitor of human DNA topoisomerase I and
human DNA topoisomerase II enzymes in vitro.

Effect of
THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 on Two
Different Cancer Cells
An 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay was performed using THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 on acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) MOLT-4 cells and HCT116
cells. Results suggest that THAQ (IC50 = 28.0 μM)
was slightly better in performance than CoII(THAQ)2 (IC50 = 33.0 μM) on ALL MOLT-4 cells (Figure 11a), whereas CoII(THAQ)2 (IC50 = 27.0 μM) was
better than THAQ (IC50 = 31.5 μM) on HCT116 cells
(Figure 11b). In a
previous study, we showed cell killing by the CuII complex
of purpurin where it was thought to be a consequence of inhibition
of human DNA topoisomerase I and human DNA topoisomerase II present
in the nucleus of MOLT-4 cells.10 In that
report, efficacy shown by the CuII complex on inhibition
of topoisomerase over that of purpurin had the same trend as the performance
of the compounds on ALL MOLT-4 cells.10 However, in the present study, although CoII(THAQ)2 was more effective than THAQ in inhibiting human DNA topoisomerase
I and human DNA topoisomerase II and also better with respect to binding
DNA, results on MOLT-4 cells suggest that the performance of the complex
was somewhat weaker than THAQ [according to obtained IC50 values (Figure 11a)] which is not unusual as reports exist in the literature showing
metal anthracyclines as less efficient than the parent compound.20,58

Figure 11 Plots showing dose response curves for the effect of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 on (a) ALL MOLT-4 cells and (b) HCT 116
cells treated with each compound for 72 h and thereafter MTT assay
performed.

This is possible if
cell killing by THAQ due to reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation more than outweighs the ability of the complex
to affect cells due to topoisomerase inhibition, keeping in mind the
fact that the complex is unlikely to succeed by the radical formation
mechanism because ROS generation by it is much less (Figure 9, Table 3). Although the difference in IC50 values is small, the result may be believed as it is the outcome
of four independent experiments. At this stage, it would be important
to remember THAQ has another attribute apart from ROS generation;
it possesses an inhibitory action on protein kinase CK2 which could
well affect cell viability in ALL MOLT-4 cells. Hence, THAQ with two
attributes (protein kinase CK2 inhibition and ROS generation) could
just be better than the complex on ALL MOLT-4 cells.29,30,58 Performance of the compounds
on HCT116 cells was however in line with our previous results obtained
for purpurin and its CuIIcomplex, that is, CoII(THAQ)2 more effective than THAQ (Figure 11b).10 This indicates
that for HCT116 cells, inhibition due to human DNA topoisomerase I
and human DNA topoisomerase II probably dominates over the ROS generation
mechanism that keeps the complex ahead. Compounds CPT, etoposide (ETO),
and DOX were used as controls for the experiment. IC50 values
for CPT was 1.5 μM, and for ETO, it was 1.0 μM and for
DOX, 1.0 μM. Results were also compared with the performance
of cisplatin on the same cell lines.59−62

Conclusions
CoII(THAQ)2 shows enhanced binding with calf
thymus DNA compared to THAQ. An important outcome of the study on
the binding of the complex with DNA was that unlike THAQ, binding
constant values for the complex did not decrease with an increase
in the pH of the medium. This can be considered a marked improvement
over THAQ and was possible because CoII(THAQ)2, unlike THAQ, does not form anionic species in solution at physiological
pH that affects binding with DNA. Hence, the complex could be effective
on cancer patients whose body fluids show fluctuation in pH. Because
cancer cells are reported to thrive at low pH and are uncomfortable
under alkaline conditions, increasing the pH of body fluids of cancer
patients is a form of treatment. CoII(THAQ)2 could be important as a drug for treatment at high pH where many
have problems. Therefore, with decreased superoxide formation, increased
affinity toward DNA, and the capability to inhibit the action of topoisomerase
enzymes, CoII(THAQ)2 could just be an important
candidate for anticancer activity having lesser possibility for toxic
side effects. Results on topoisomerase inhibition enable the complex
to be an effective anticancer agent, supported by its performance
on ALL MOLT-4 and HCT 116 cells adding to an emerging field of trying
inorganic complexes as anticancer drugs.35,62 Our results are also in agreement with a recent report on the participation
of different metal ions in doxorubicin complexes found to be active
on MCF-7 breast cancer cells.35

Experimental
Procedures
Materials and Preparation of Solutions
THAQ was purchased
from BDH, England, and purified by re-crystallization from the alcohol–water
mixture. Hydroxy-9,10-anthraquinone, which is sensitive to light and
oxygen, solutions were prepared just before use or stored in dark
bottles under deaerated condition. CoCl2·6H2O [Merck, India] was dissolved in deionized triple-distilled water.
Calf thymus DNA, purchased from Sisco Research Laboratories, India,
was dissolved in phosphate buffer and kept for a minimum of 24 h.
Its concentration was determined in terms of nucleotide at 260 nm
considering ε260 to be 6600 M–1 cm–1. Absorbance at 260 and 280 nm was used to
calculate the ratio [1.8 < A260/A280 > 1.9] that indicates DNA to be sufficiently
free of protein. Quality of the calf thymus DNA used was also checked
from the characteristic circular dichroism band at 260 nm. Phosphate
buffer containing 120 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2,
and 0.5 mM MgCl2 was prepared to maintain pH in the physiological
pH range (6.8–8.2) during titration of the complex with DNA.
Recombinant human DNA topoisomerase I and human DNA topoisomerase
II alpha were purchased from TopoGENInc (Port Orange, Florida, USA).

Methods
Instrumental Techniques
Absorption spectra related
to complex formation and DNA titration were recorded on a JASCO V-630
spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy of the
solid complex was recorded on a PerkinElmer RX-I spectrophotometer
using KBr pellets. Mass spectrum was recorded on Micromass Q-Tof micro,
Waters Corporation. Elemental analysis was done on a PerkinElmer 2400
Series-II CHN analyzer. EPR spectrum was recorded on a JEOL JES-FA
200 ESR spectrophotometer. DNA binding studies using fluorescence
were done on a RF-530 IPC spectrofluorophotometer, Shimadzu. Enzyme
assay was performed on a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer using the kinetics
software of the instrument.

Preparation of CoII(THAQ)2
A
solution of THAQ (0.0054 g) in methanol (100 mL) was added to a solution
of CoCl2 (0.0024 g) in 0.2 M aqueous NaNO3 (100
mL). pH was adjusted to 5.5, and the mixture was warmed under reflux
for 4 h. After two weeks, a compound having a reddish violet color
appeared following slow evaporation of the solvent. It was filtered
and recrystallized.

2.35. Molecular ion peak (M) at 601.35; [M – 3(OH)]+ = 553.36; λmax = 554 nm in DMSO.

DNA Binding
Interaction of the complex with calf thymus
DNA was followed considering the following equilibrium (eq 2). 2  L represents the complex,
and Kd is the dissociation constant25−27,29 whose reciprocal is the apparent
binding constant
(Kapp). Equation 3 was obtained from eq 2 where reciprocal of the change in absorbance
or fluorescence was plotted against reciprocal of (CD – C0). CD refers to the concentration of calf thymus DNA, and C0 is the concentration of the complex. For fluorescence
experiments, the complex was excited at 560 nm and emission recorded
at 650 nm. Using eq 3, ΔAmax and Kapp (Kd–1) were determined from the intercept and slope, respectively. 3  ΔA represents
the change
in absorbance of the complex following interaction with DNA. ΔAmax is the maximum change in absorbance for
each titration. For fluorescence experiments, ΔA and ΔAmax of eq 3 were ΔF and ΔFmax, respectively. 4   5  ΔA/ΔAmax or ΔF/ΔFmax was plotted against CD. Equations 4 and 5 were used to fit the data
according to nonlinear
square fit analysis providing another value for apparent binding constant.25−27,29 Titration of the complex with
DNA was analyzed according to a modified form of the Scatchard equation
[eq 6]. Overall binding
constant (K′) and site size (n) were determined.45 6  r = Cb/CD; Cb is the concentration of the bound form of
the complex, and Cf is the free form.
“n” provides binding stoichiometry
in terms of bound complex
per nucleotide, whereas “nb”
reciprocal of “n” provides binding
site size in terms of the number of nucleotides bound to the complex.
“nb” was obtained by plotting
ΔA/ΔAmax or
ΔF/ΔFmax against CD/[complex]. K′ was
obtained by multiplying Kapp with “nb”. Values of K′
obtained in this manner from UV–vis and fluorescence spectroscopy
were compared with that obtained directly from Scatchard plots. The
titrimetric data were fitted to another form of a double reciprocal
plot having intercept on y axis = 1 (eq 7) 7  

This equation provides another value
for the apparent binding constant (Kapp) for interaction of the complex with DNA which when multiplied by nb provides overall binding constant (K′).

NADH Dehydrogenase Assay
An enzyme
assay was performed
at 298 K with cytochrome c as an electron acceptor.48 Both THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 were tried in NADH-cytochrome c reductase activity
where reduction of cytochrome c was followed at 550
nm. In the assay, performed at pH 7.4 (0.05 M HEPES buffer), the concentration
of THAQ and CoII(THAQ)2 was varied from 0 to
50.0 μM. Activity of NADH dehydrogenase was expressed in units
where one unit of activity reduces 1.0 μmol oxidized cytochrome c per minute at pH 7.4 at 298 K.

DNA Relaxation Assays for
Topoisomerase I and Topoisomerase
II
DNA relaxation assays for recombinant human DNA topoisomerase
I and human DNA topoisomerase II were performed in the absence and
presence of THAQ and the complex by briefly incubating 100 fmol supercoiled
pBS SK (+) DNA with 50 fmol enzyme in buffer, provided with the enzymes.
The reaction buffer contained 5 mM dithiothreitol as the reducing
agent. DMSO concentration was maintained at 0.5% (vehicle control).
Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and loaded on 1%
agarose gel. It was thereafter electrophoresed overnight at 20 V.
On completion of electrophoresis, gels were stained with 0.5 μg
mL–1 ethidium bromide and viewed by Gel Doc 2000
(BioRad) under UV illumination. Relaxation was realized by monitoring
the decreased electrophoretic mobility of relaxed topoisomers of pBS
SK (+) DNA.

Cell Culture
HCT 116 and MOLT-4
cells were cultured
in McCoy’s 5A media (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US) and
RPMI-1640 media (GIBCO, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, US), respectively.
Media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (GIBCO), antibiotic
mixture 1× penicillin–streptomycin–neomycin (GIBCO),
and gentamicin reagent solution (GIBCO). Cells were incubated in a
humidified CO2 incubator at 37 °C.

Cell Viability
Assay
Cells were seeded on a 96-well
plate one day prior to compound addition. They were treated with compounds
dissolved in DMSO. DMSO concentration was less than 0.5%. After 48
h of incubation, cells were washed with 1× phosphate-buffered
saline and treated with MTT for 4 h at 37 °C. Precipitates were
dissolved in DMSO, and plates were analyzed on a Thermo MULTISKAN
EX plate reader at 595 nm to determine IC50; IC50 is the concentration required to kill 50% of the cell population.
