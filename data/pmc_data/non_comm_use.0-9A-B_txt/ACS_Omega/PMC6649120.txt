The
peroxidation of luminol yields bright luminescence when the
reaction is catalyzed by heme proteins. However, an excess of peroxide
leads to less light and altered luminescence kinetics, an effect commonly
referred to as “suicide inactivation”. The aim of this
study is to present the molecular processes causing this effect. A
comprehensive set of data reported here demonstrates that suicide
inactivation is due to a peroxide-induced liberation of iron from
its coordinating porphyrin. Liberated iron launches catalysis of the
reaction at much lower efficiency. The light-yielding efficiencies
of different organic and inorganic catalysts are precisely quantified
and compared. It is shown that the catalysis by free iron involves
superoxide. This is explained by the formation of a ferryl-oxo-iron
complex. In this context, a complete reaction mechanism involving
a modified Fenton–Haber–Weiss cycle is proposed for
the first time. The switch from the highly efficient biogenically
catalyzed luminescence to a less efficient inorganically catalyzed
reaction is accompanied by a transition from “flash-type”
to “glow-type” luminescence kinetics. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid-mediated chelation of iron is used to demonstrate this effect
and to separate both kinetics. The explanation of kinetic heterodyning
is underpinned by mathematical modeling. The results are able to explain
the as yet unexplained phenomena discussed in the less recent literature
and to settle disputes about them. It is concluded that peroxide concentrations
exceeding the level tolerated by the catalyzing heme protein negatively
impact performance and precision of luminol-based assays, where the
light yield is used as a quantitative measure for analyte concentrations.

Introduction
Chemiluminescence assays
are among the most sensitive quantification
methods allowing the detection of diverse analytes in concentrations
as low as picomolar or even attomolar. In particular, assays based
on luminol, one of the most important chemiluminescent compounds,1 are used for a broad variety of analytes (ref (2) and more refs in ref (3)), and even forensic investigators
take advantage of the luminol-based detection of blood.4 However, circumspection is necessary with assay
design when the luminol reaction is employed, and the light yield
(photon counts) is used to determine analyte concentrations. The systematic
experimental survey reported here investigates the molecular causes
of the so-called “suicide inactivation” and the changes
in luminescence yield and kinetics linked with it. The focus is on
the liberation of iron from its porphyrin coordination during luminol
reactions catalyzed by heme-based catalysts. In a complementary study,
the effects of enhancers, inhibitors, and additives able to partially
repress the undesired iron liberation are analyzed and discussed in
detail.3

The Luminol Reaction
5-Amino-2,3-dihydro-1,4-phthalazinedione
also known as luminol (LH2) emits blue light when oxidized
in an alkaline environment in the presence of a strong oxidizing agent
such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The oxidizing
peroxide donates the oxygen needed for the reaction and converts luminol
into aminophthalate (AP*), which is the light-emitting product.

The luminol reaction is complex because a catalyst is indispensable
for detectable light emission. Biogenic porphyrins carrying a central
iron (heme) typically serve as catalysts. The oxidation state switching
of the central iron is between III (ferric state) and IV (ferryl state)
and traverses through a three stage cycle, the so-called peroxidative
cycle, when a hydrogen donor (AH) and a peroxide (H2O2) are present (details are given in the Supporting Information of Plieth 20183).

Peroxidases are widely used for luminol-based applications.
In
this context, luminescence catalyzed by peroxidases is called enzyme-catalyzed
chemiluminescence (eCL). Apart from genuine peroxidases, there are
many other heme proteins which also exhibit a peroxidase activity.
For the luminol reaction, free iron porphyrin, without a protein shell
(i.e., hemin), is also sufficient to catalyze the luminescent reaction.5−8

Even dissolved free iron ions, not coordinated by a porphyrin
system,
and also many other transition metals are able to catalyze the luminol–H2O2-reaction and thereby produce some detectable
light.9−11 This is called inorganically catalyzed chemiluminescence
(iCL) to distinguish it from organic catalysts. Both the light yield
efficiency of iCL and its catalytic mechanism are different from those
of the peroxidative cycle. Here, the light-yield efficiencies of diverse
catalysts are calculated and compared, and a mechanism is proposed,
describing how the iCL-yielding luminol reaction is catalyzed by non-porphyrin
iron.

The intricate dependency of the reaction on peroxide concentration,
pH, and the presence of various catalysts is investigated. It is demonstrated
that the light yield from luminol reactions driven by heme compounds
is severely impaired when the reducing substrate (luminol) is not
properly balanced with the oxidizing substrate (H2O2). Several lines of evidence are provided that this impairment
is due to liberation of catalytically active iron ions from their
porphyrin coordination. This liberation is accompanied by a switch
from highly efficient eCL to less efficient iCL. Thus, often and unintentionally,
both iCL and eCL occur within the same reaction and reveal mixed (i.e.,
heterodyned) chemiluminescence kinetics. It is experimentally demonstrated
by diverse means how the distinct kinetic components of eCL and iCL
can be separated, analyzed, and mathematically modeled.

Results
Catalysis
of Luminol eCL by Horseradish Peroxidase Is Hampered
by H2O2-Induced Peroxidase Inhibition
H2O2 dilution series were prepared under different
pH conditions, and luminescence was recorded several minutes for each
dilution to demonstrate the peroxidase inhibition at high [H2O2]. The integrated light yield plotted against the H2O2 concentration (Figure 1) shows that light yield does not strictly
increase with increasing [H2O2]. There is rather
a maximum around 1 mM of H2O2 above which less
light is produced because of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) inactivation
by excess peroxide.

Figure 1 Dependence of luminol eCL on hydrogen peroxide concentration
and
pH with HRP as the catalyst. Luminol luminescence was recorded at
various peroxide concentrations and different pH values. Luminescence,
integrated over the first 10 min of the reaction, is plotted against
[H2O2]. Reactions were started by injecting
a mix of catalyst and luminol into a H2O2 solution
to give the following assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl; pH as indicated
in the inset; 1 μg/mL of HRP, which corresponds to a concentration
of 23 nM Fe (pFe = 7.6); [LH–] = 250 μM; [H2O2] as given on the abscissa; (A) 1 mM CaCl2 was allowed because the HRP is a Ca2+-sensitive
peroxidase. (B) Same experiments were performed in the absence of
Ca2+ [i.e., in the presence of 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)]. Data are averages of four technical replicates. Error
bars represent the standard deviation (SD). The SD is below symbol
size, where no error bar can be seen. These data are presented in
the Supporting Information (Figure S1.1)
on a log–log scale for more details.

This has been observed earlier with other peroxidase indicator
substrates, and the effect is referred to as “suicide inactivation”.12−16 It is remarkable that the suicide inactivation shifts toward higher
[H2O2] (Table S1 in the Supporting Information) when the reaction is performed at
higher proton concentrations (i.e., pH ≤ 9). Qualitatively,
the suicide inactivation is largely independent of the presence of
Ca2+ ions (Figures 1 and S1.1). Quantitatively, however,
the luminescence intensity decreases to a third when Ca2+ is sequestered by EDTA (Figure 1B). This is in accordance with other findings, demonstrating
that plant peroxidases are calcium-dependent (e.g., refs17−20).

Other Iron Porphyrin Proteins Catalyzing the Luminol Reaction
Are Also Inhibited by H2O2
There are
many other iron-porphyrin proteins which also exhibit peroxidase activity,21−29 and there was expectation that they are less sensitive to high [H2O2] than the HRP. Consequently, some of these proteins,
namely, cytochrome c (Cyt c) and
hemoglobin (Hb), were also tested for peroxide inactivation and were
found to behave in a similar manner as HRP (Figure 2A,B). This is in line with previous studies.22,30

Figure 2 Dependence
of luminol eCL on hydrogen peroxide concentration, pH,
and the type of catalyst. Luminescence, integrated over the first
10 min of the reaction, is plotted against [H2O2] at different pH values. (A) Luminol reaction with Hb 4 μg/mL
corresponding to 0.25 μM iron (pFe = 6.6) as the catalyst; (B)
luminol luminescence with 10 μg/mL Cyt c corresponding
to 0.81 μM Fe (pFe = 6.1); and (C) luminol luminescence with
hemin (2.5 μM; pFe = 5.6) as the catalyst in the assay medium.
Reactions were started by injecting a mix of catalyst and luminol
into an H2O2 solution to give the following
assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl; pH as indicated in the insets;
[LH–] = 250 μM; [H2O2] as given on the abscissa. Data are averages of four technical replicates.
Error bars represent the SD. The SD is below symbol size, where no
error bar can be seen. These data are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1.2) on a log–log
scale for more details.

It is also known from previous studies5−8 that iron porphyrin itself (hemin),
without a protein shell, can produce light in the presence of luminol.
Surprisingly, the catalytic activity of hemin is also inhibited by
high [H2O2] (Figure 2C). This is the first evidence that the suicide
inactivation is not the result of protein oxidation by H2O2 but rather is due to the disintegration of porphyrin
and the liberation of its central iron. However, it could be argued
that the inhibition of eCL at [H2O2] > 1
mM
may be an intrinsic property of luminol or its oxidation products
and possibly not caused by iron depletion of porphyrin. To shed light
on this, experiments were performed as above but with free iron ions
as catalysts (=iCL).

Catalytic Activity of Free Iron Is Enhanced
by Increasing pH
and [H2O2]
When iCL was screened for
light productivity, it turned out that the light yield increased with
higher [H2O2] and at more alkaline pH values
(Figure 3). There is
no specific [H2O2] at which an inhibition of
the catalytic activity was seen. The result is the same, no matter
which inorganic iron salt was used as a source of free iron ions (Supporting Information Figure S2.1).

catalyzed luminol luminescence and its dependence
on the hydrogen peroxide concentration and pH with ionic iron (25
μM FeSO4; pFe = 4.6) as the catalyst. The luminescence
integrated over the first 10 min of the reaction is plotted against
[H2O2]. Reactions were started by injecting
a mix of catalyst and luminol into a H2O2 solution
to give the following assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl; pH as indicated
in the inset; [LH–] = 250 μM. Data are averages
of four technical replicates. Error bars represent the SD. The SD
is below symbol size, where no error bar can be seen. These data are
presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S2.1B) on a log–log scale for more details.

Mechanism of Non-porphyrin
Iron Catalysis Is Still Obscure
The main unknown here (Figure 3) is the catalytic
mechanism driving the iCL reaction.
A peroxidase cycle as presented by Plieth (2018)3 can be excluded because there is no porphyrin coordinating
the iron. The classical Fenton–Haber–Weiss cycle (cFHW, Supporting Information Figure S2.3) involving
a production of hydroxyl radicals (OH•; Supporting Information eq S2.3) could be invoked
as a basis for a possible mechanism yielding luminol radicals (L•–). However, there are data and arguments against
it. If the cFHW reaction was the driving mechanism, it would imply
that the reaction could be inhibited by the OH•-scavengers
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and mannitol.25,31 However, data
obtained in the course of this study (Supporting Information Figure S2.4) clearly indicate that both scavengers
do not inhibit the luminol reaction. Thus, with the assay conditions
used (pH = 9; [H2O2] > 1 mM), a cFHW-driven
catalysis can be ruled out and a modified FHW mechanism is proposed
instead (see the Discussion section below
and Supporting Information 2.5).

The FHW mechanism, however, involves superoxide (Supporting Information eqs S2.4 and S2.5). This can be demonstrated
by the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) to the reaction. At
high activities, this enzyme effectively neutralizes superoxide and
reduces iCL (Figure 4). No such inhibiting effect is seen with eCL. Rather, the biogenic
luminescence increases at high [SOD] (Figure 4). This effect is explained and discussed
below (see the Discussion section).

Figure 4 Luminol luminescence
in the presence of SOD with different catalysts
as indicated in the inset. Luminescence data represent light yield
(ILY) integrated over the first 15 min
of the reaction. A decrease of light yield is seen with iCL (free
iron as catalysts) but not with eCL (iron-porphyrin compounds as catalysts).
The reactions were started by injecting H2O2 to a mix of catalyst and luminol to give the following assay conditions:
Tris/HCl 100 mM; [H2O2] = 1.1 mM; [LH–] = 750 μM; [HRP] = 0.5 μg/mL; [Cyt c] = 10 μg/mL; [Hb] = 30 μg/mL; [hemin] = 1 μM;
[FeSO4] = 200 μM; [FeEDDHA] = 100 μM; pH =
9. Data are normalized by the luminescence obtained without SOD. Data
are means of n = 3 technical replicates. Error bars
represent the SD. The SD is below symbol size, where no error bar
can be seen.

There Are Significant Differences in Relative Light-Yield Efficiency
between iCL and eCL
If the relative efficiency of light production
(light-yield efficiency ELY) is to be
compared for the different catalysts tested so far, then the catalyst
concentration used is critical. ELY is
defined here as the logarithm of the ratio of integrated light measured
(ILY = integrated light yield) and the
catalytic iron concentration [Fe] used (eq 1) 1  ELY thus represents
the amount of light each iron atom in the assay is able to produce,
regardless of being porphyrin-coordinated or free (more details are
given in Supporting Information 3; eqs
S3.1–S3.3).

Standard conditions were chosen to measure ELY for diverse catalysts (Figure 5). Therefore, dilution series of the catalysts
were prepared, and the emitted light was recorded for each dilution.28 The five dilutions giving the best linear correlation
(i.e., maximum correlation coefficient r2) on a log–log plot (Figure 5A) were used to calculate ELY. These five ELY values were averaged
and plotted as a bar diagram (Figure 5B).

Figure 5 Light-yield efficiencies of iCL and eCL catalysts under
mild conditions.
(A) Five different concentrations of catalysts were used to produce
light under controlled mild assay conditions (100 mM Tris/HCl pH =
9; [H2O2] = 1.1 mM; [LH–]
= 750 μM; catalysts as indicated in the inset). The reactions
were started by injecting H2O2 into a mix of
catalyst and luminol. The log of integrated light yield (ILY) of each reaction is plotted against the total iron
concentration, given as pFe, in the assay. For FeEDDHA, Fe(NO3)3, and hemin, the total iron concentration equals
the molarity of the respective substance. For proteins, the Fe molarities
were calculated as follows according to the molecular weight of the
protein and the number of Fe bound to each protein molecule: 1 μg/mL
of Hb = 0.0625 μM of Fe; 1 μg/mL of Cyt c = 0.081 μM of Fe; and 1 μg/mL of HRP = 0.023 μM
of Fe. (B) Efficiencies ELY for each reaction
calculated according to eq 1 were averaged for each catalyst (n = 5)
and plotted as a bar chart. Error bars represent SDs.

Marked differences in light-yield efficiency between
the different
catalysts were observed. The light yield efficiency of hemin is around ELY = 12 and thus about two orders of magnitude
greater than ELY obtained from free iron.
This means that each iron atom can produce about 100 times more light
when it is coordinated by porphyrin. When the catalyzing iron porphyrin
has a protein shell as is the case with Hb and Cyt c, its ELY is another order of magnitude
greater and emits 1000 times more light compared with free Fe. Finally,
when the porphyrin-coordinated iron (heme) constitutes the central
core of a genuine peroxidase as is the case with HRP, its efficiency ELY is another two orders of magnitudes higher
(ELY = 15). Thus, iron embedded in HRP
can produce 100 000 times more photons during the first minutes
of the luminol reaction than free iron.

This experiment (Figure 5) was repeated several
times and with different pH values
(Supporting Information Figure S3) as light
yields were found to be pH-dependent (Figures 1–3). Hb, hemin,
and free Fe clearly show that ELY is pH-dependent
(Figure S3). The more alkaline the medium,
the better is ELY. This is in accordance
with what has been observed previously (Figures 2A,C and 3). HRP and
Cyt c do not show such strict correlation of pH and ELY, which is also in line with prior observations
(Figures 1 and 2B).

Chelators Help To Distinguish between iCL
and eCL
When
the luminol reaction is catalyzed by free iron dissolved from an iron
salt (FeSO4, FeCl2, or FeNO3), EDTA
is able to abolish the reaction as soon as the total chelator concentration
[EDTA] is above the total iron concentration [Fe] (Figure 6; orange symbols). This is
because all free iron ions are sequestered away by EDTA and are thus
unable to catalyze the luminol reaction because they cannot form a
ferryl-oxo-iron complex (for details see the Discussion section).

Figure 6 Luminol luminescence in the presence of a metal chelator (EDTA)
with different catalysts as indicated in the inset. Normalized luminescence
data represent light yield (ILY) integrated
over the first 15 min of the reaction. Data are normalized by the
luminescence obtained without EDTA. A decrease of light yield is seen
with iCL (free iron as catalysts) but not with eCL (heme protein as
the catalyst). Assay conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM; pH = 9; no added
Ca2+; [LH–] = 750 μM; [H2O2] = 1.1 mM; catalysts as indicated in the inset: [HRP]
= 0.5 μg/mL; [Hb] = 20 μg/mL; [FeSO4] = 200
μM; [FeEDDHA] = 100 μM; [Cyt c] = 20
μg/mL. The reactions were started by injecting H2O2 to a mix of catalyst and luminol. Data are normalized
by the luminescence obtained without EDTA. Data are means of n = 3 technical replicates. Error bars represent the SD.
The SD is below symbol size, where no error bar can be seen.

The situation is different when
iron is dissolved as FeEDDHA (brown
symbols in Figure 6). EDTA (pKFe = 25) is unable to sequester
all the catalysts because EDDHA, which is the stronger chelator (pKFe = 3532−34), competes with it and is thereby
able to keep a certain amount of Fe free in solution. Generally, the
amount of free iron available to catalyze the iCL reaction is dependent
on the assay conditions (pH, ionic strength, presence of divalent
cations, and temperature) and the stability constants of the two competing
chelates FeEDTA and FeEDDHA.32−34

Enzymatically catalyzed
luminescence produced by HRP is clearly
reduced by EDTA (green symbols in Figure 6), although not totally quenched, because
HRP is a Ca2+-dependent protein.18,20,35 This agrees with data shown previously (Figure 1). In contrast, Hb
and Cyt c (red and pink symbols, respectively, in Figure 6) appear less Ca2+-dependent and thus show negligible reduction of light yield
by high [EDTA].

The EDTA effect on free iron (orange symbols
in Figure 6) was used
to investigate the
peroxide-induced suicide inactivation of eCL in more detail. When
the suicide inactivation is recorded in the presence of EDTA (Figure 7; red symbols), there
is less luminescence at high [H2O2], whereas
without EDTA or with extra divalent cations, there is increased luminescence.
This indicates that the luminescence seen without the chelator at
high [H2O2] is due to catalysis by free iron
liberated from its porphyrin coordination by H2O2, as shown in Figure 3. In the presence of EDTA, the liberated iron is sequestered and
does not yield light at high [H2O2]. Equivalent
results were obtained with Cyt c and hemin (see Figure
S4 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 7 Dependence
of luminol eCL catalyzed by Hb on the presence of EDTA
or divalent cations. At high [H2O2] (red shaded
area), luminescence progressively originates from modified Fenton–Haber–Weiss
cycle (mFHW) catalysis by free iron released from heme. This is inhibited
in the presence of EDTA. Luminescence data represent light yield (ILY) integrated over the first 15 min of the
reaction. Assay conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM; pH = 9; [LH–] = 750 μM; [Hb] = 50 μg/mL; and extra Ca2+, Mg2+, or EDTA as indicated in the inset. The reactions
were started by injecting a mix of catalyst and luminol into the buffer
volume containing H2O2 so that the [H2O2] indicated by the abscissa was reached.

Kinetic Analyses Reveal iCL and eCL Running
in Parallel and
Provide More Details about the Peroxidase Suicide Inactivation and
Iron Liberation
Luminescence kinetics produced by redox reactions
are usually characterized as being of either glow-type or flash-type.
A precise definition of how these two terms are used in the context
here is given in the Supporting Information (SI5; Figures S5.1–S5.5; eqs S5.1–S5.5).

The
kinetics of the light output are of the glow-type luminescence when
the luminol reaction is catalyzed by free iron ions (Figure 8). iCL reaches a certain level
when the reaction is started by mixing luminol and iron ions with
H2O2, and light output continues for many minutes
without decay. eCL kinetics, in contrast, are mainly of the flash-type
(Figure 9). This implies
that the luminescence catalyzed by heme-coordinated iron is transient
and decays after it has reached a maximum amplitude. At [H2O2] below 0.5 mM, the transients are slow, although always
with a continuous decay after a maximum. With higher [H2O2], above 0.5 mM H2O2, the transient
amplitude is high and the kinetics are fast (i.e., the exponential
decay has a short time constant). At [H2O2]
above 10 mM, the eCL “flash” amplitudes are reduced.

Figure 8 Glow-type
kinetics of luminol luminescence catalyzed by free iron.
The reactions were started at t = 134 s by injecting
a mixture of luminol and FeSO4 into assay buffer with H2O2. Assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl pH = 9; [LH–] = 250 μM; [Fe] = 25 μM (pFe = 4.6). [H2O2] (μM) as indicated in the insets. (A)
Kinetics given on a semi-log plot. (B) Data shown in A were normalized
by the area under the curve and plotted on linear coordinates to ease
direct comparison of the kinetics. This shows that there is no decrease
in the luminescence within the recording period (i.e., glow-type luminescence).

Figure 9 Flash-type kinetics of luminol luminescence
catalyzed by hemin
and HRP. The reactions were started at t = 134 s
by injecting a mixture of luminol and catalyst into assay buffer with
H2O2. Assay conditions: [LH–] = 250 μM; pH = 9; [H2O2], as indicated
in the insets. (A) eCL kinetics obtained with hemin (2.5 μM)
on a semilog plot. (C) eCL kinetics obtained with HRP (1 μg/mL,
which corresponds to 0.023 μM of iron or pFe = 7.6) on a semilog
plot. (B,D) Data shown in A and B were normalized by the area under
the curve and plotted on linear coordinates to ease direct comparison.
This shows that there is a flash-type luminescence at all H2O2 concentrations tested. However, all kinetics also have
a glow-type component incorporated, which becomes more pronounced
at high [H2O2] and indicates the liberation
of iron from heme and the transition from eCL to iCL. The inset in
B gives a magnification of the ordinate.

On closer scrutiny, it becomes evident that with high [H2O2], the flash is always followed by a glow (Figure 9B,D), which resembles
the iCL luminescence caused by free iron (Figure 8). This indicates that there is a transition
from flash-type to glow-type kinetics during the course of the reaction.
The cause for this is highly likely to be the liberation of iron from
its porphyrin coordination. Similar data obtained with Hb and Cyt c as catalysts are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S6).

The statement that
the glow component in the kinetics of eCL originates
from liberated iron can easily be verified when the kinetics are compared
with kinetics recorded in the presence of a chelator (Figure 10). Without EDTA, eCL always
occurs along with biphasic flash-glow kinetics (Supporting Information eq S5.4; Figure S5.5) when [H2O2] is high. However, in the presence of EDTA, only monophasic
flash-type kinetics can be seen, ending in darkness. Divalent cations
seem to assist the liberation of iron from its porphyrin coordination
(Figure 10 blue and
green curves). Similar data obtained with Cyt c and
hemin as catalysts are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S6) and confirm that EDTA degenerates biphasic
to monophasic kinetics.

Figure 10 Kinetics of luminol eCL with Hb as the catalyst
in the presence
of EDTA or divalent cations. (A) At [H2O2] =
100 mM, free iron is liberated from heme. The liberated iron catalyzes
the chemiluminescence reaction via the mFHW mechanism and produces
glow-type kinetics. In the presence of EDTA (red curve), the glow-type
component in the kinetics is abolished and only the flash component
remains. (B) Data from A presented on a log–log plot. Assay
conditions: Tris/HCl 100 mM; pH = 9; 750 μM luminol; [Hb] =
50 μg/mL; and extra Ca2+, Mg2+, or EDTA,
as indicated in the insets. The reactions were started by injection
of H2O2 to a final concentration of [H2O2] = 100 mM. Kinetics are from the data set already presented
in Figure 7. Data are
normalized by the peak value.

It has been shown previously3 that
luminol
at high concentrations prevents the suicide inactivation to some extent
and exerts a protective effect on the heme group. This is also reflected
in the kinetics (Supporting Information Figure S8) and provides another indication that H2O2 induces liberation of iron and an eCL-to-iCL transition.
The lower the luminol concentration in the assay, the more pronounced
are luminescence kinetics, revealing catalysis by free iron when [H2O2] is high (Supporting Information Figure S8D).

Soret Band Monitoring Verifies the Peroxide-Induced
Destruction
of Porphyrin
Heme compounds typically absorb light in the
range between 390 and 450 nm. Each compound has a characteristic so-called
Soret peak in this range.36−38 The Soret peak can be used to
monitor the intactness of the respective porphyrin group. Here (Figure 11A), it is demonstrated
that the Soret peak of Hb disappears with increasing concentrations
of peroxide, indicating the destruction of the iron-coordinating system.

Figure 11 Absorbance
of Hb depending on [H2O2]. (A)
Absorbance was scanned around the typical Soret band of Hb (i.e.,
λ = 412 nm) in the presence of H2O2 at
concentrations (μM) as indicated by the inset. (B) A (412 nm
± 10) plotted against the respective [H2O2]. The EC50 was obtained by four-parametric logistic curve
fitting. Data in B represent averages of n = 5; error
bars indicate the SD. Assay conditions: 100 mM Tris/HCl pH = 9 at
28 °C; [Hb] = 1.25 mg/mL; [H2O2] in (μM)
as indicated by the abscissa; 1 h preincubation at 28 °C before
spectral recording.

The Soret-peak absorbance
(λabs = 412 nm for Hb)
plotted against [H2O2] (Figure 11B) indicates an EC50 in the range
of 1 mM < [H2O2] < 10 mM. Similar data
were obtained with Cyt c and hemin (Supporting Information Figures S9.1 and S9.2). The EC50 values of the Soret-peak reduction (Figure 11B, Supporting Information Figures S9.1B and S9.2B) roughly coincide with the suicide inactivation
reaction (Supporting Information Figures
S1.1 and S1.2B; Table S1) observed before. This coincidence is another
indication that the suicide inactivation of luminescence is caused
by disintegration of porphyrin and the liberation of iron from it.

A H2O2-induced liberation of the whole intact
iron porphyrin complex from the heme proteins is unlikely because
in this case, the absorbance would not vanish with increasing [H2O2] but rather display a Soret band broadening
to become the spectrum seen with hemin (Figure S9.2).

Summary
of Results
The data presented here highlight the intertwined
processes that
occur during the luminol reaction: the reduction of eCL (i.e., the
so-called suicide inactivation; Figures 1 and 2, and Supporting Information Figures S1.1 and S1.2)
observed with high peroxide concentrations ([H2O2] > 1 mM) is due to H2O2-induced disintegration
of the heme catalyst, as demonstrated by Soret band extinction (Figure 11; Supporting Information Figures S9.1 and S9.2) and the concomitant
liberation of free iron. Free iron, when liberated from heme, launches
iCL of glow-type kinetics and with low light-yield efficiency (Figure 5; Supporting Information Figure S3). Thus, suicide inactivation
leads to a transition from eCL to iCL (Figures 8–10, and Supporting Information Figures S6 and S7) during
the running reaction and to a heterodyning of flash-type and glow-type
luminescence kinetics (Figure 9; Supporting Information Figure
S6). The glow component in these mixed kinetics can be either reduced
by sufficiently high luminol concentrations (Supporting Information Figure S8) or completely abolished by EDTA-mediated
iron chelation (Figure 10; Supporting Information Figure
S7).

Discussion
Genuine Peroxidases and “Pseudo-Peroxidases”
The most prominent catalysts of the luminol reaction are heme peroxidases,
which evolved in nature to reduce peroxides with the help of reducing
organic substrates. Other heme compounds such as Hbs, cytochromes,
and even hemin also have peroxidase activities (Figures 1 and 2). They have
been referred to as “pseudo-peroxidases” to distinguish
them from genuine peroxidases.39 Their
pH dependencies can be used to display this distinction experimentally.
The HRP-driven luminol reaction exhibited a maximum light yield at
pH ≈ 8 (Figure 1). However, with other heme compounds, more light is produced at
pH > 9 and much less when pH < 9 (Figure 2). This can be explained by the chemistry
of the luminol reaction (details in ref (3)), which prefers high pH with an apparent pK at 8.2.40 The maximum activity
of HRP at pH ≈ 8 detected here (Figure 1) indicates that a genuine peroxidase has
a protein shell which shields the central catalytic heme core from
the conditions of the bulk buffer and provides it with the specific
local environment necessary for its specific enzymatic activity. Such
a local environment is needed by the HRP for the oxidation of a broad
spectrum of substrates. Pseudo-peroxidases like Hb and Cyt c evolved in nature to perform different tasks. Consequently,
they have no protein shell to shield the heme for peroxidation of
diverse substrates, and their pseudo-peroxidase activities (Figure 2A,B) reflect a pH
and peroxide dependency similar to that seen with hemin (Figure 2C). In terms of peroxidase
activity, it can be concluded that pseudo-peroxidases fulfill no more
than just an “eggcup function” to hold the catalytic
heme in place and have neither optimized nor specific peroxidase function
as is the case of genuine peroxidases like HRP.

Another property
of HRP that makes it distinct from pseudo-peroxidases is the calcium
dependency of its catalytic efficiency (compare Figure 1A,B), which is not observed with Cyt c and Hb (Figures 6 and 7; Supporting Information Figure S4).

As a control, non-heme iron proteins
like ferritin and ferredoxin
were tested for their ability to catalyze the luminol reaction (Supporting Information Figure S2.2). In comparison
with the light production catalyzed by free iron ions (Figure 3; Supporting Information Figure S2.1), these proteins have no activity beyond
that of the iron ions they harbor.

Peroxidase Suicide Inactivation
Usually, the reaction
rate of enzyme-catalyzed reactions saturates with increasing substrate
concentrations, according to the Michaelis–Menten–Henri
model.41 This is different with heme peroxidase-catalyzed
reactions. With increasing [H2O2], the reaction
rate reaches a maximum and is inactivated by higher [H2O2] (Figures 1 and 2). This suicide inactivation
is typical for heme peroxidases and has already been investigated
photometrically with various indicator substrates.12,14−16,42 Diverse inactivation
mechanisms have been proposed.43 The most
likely one is liberation of iron, as substantiated by spectroscopic
data.12,13,44 This view
is supported by the luminometric approach reported here (Figures 1–3, and Supporting Information Figures S1.1, S1.3, and S2.1) and validated by experiments which
involve the chelator EDTA (Figures 6, 7, and 10, and Supporting Information Figures S4
and S7) and Soret peak monitoring (Figure 11; and Supporting Information Figures S9.1 and S9.2). These data also confirm the peroxide-induced
iron release from Hb demonstrated earlier.45

Hemin is able to catalyze the eCL reaction (Figure 2C) and exhibits a similar inhibition
pattern at high [H2O2], like the (pseudo-)peroxidases
(Figures 1 and 2A,B). The light maximum obtained at around 1 mM
H2O2 (Figures 1, 2, and 7; and Supporting Information Figures S1.1,
S1.2, and S4) is hence a feature of heme and less a feature of the
protein to which it is bound.

Apart from the peroxidative cycle
(ref (3) suppl.), HRP
and possibly other heme-based catalysts
may also operate an oxygenation cycle with compound III as an intermediate.16,46 This has been proposed for plant peroxidases by Kimura et al. (2014),46 particularly for the presence of free ferrous
iron ions and dissolved oxygen, at high [H2O2] and under alkaline conditions. For the suicide inactivation as
shown here (Figures 1, 2, and 7; and Supporting Information Figures S1.1, S1.2, and
S4), the latter two conditions are given and free iron is produced
during suicide inactivation, as demonstrated. Hence, an involvement
of compound III is likely.

When HRP, immobilized on a collagen
fibril membrane, was removed
during the luminol reaction, no cessation of the luminescence was
seen. Instead, a continuing glow-type luminescence was observed.47 This finding can now be easily explained by
the suicide inactivation experiments reported here: iron was liberated
from membrane-bound HRP by H2O2 and remained
in the reaction as a catalyst after the membrane together with the
attached HRP apoprotein was removed.

Light-Yield Efficiency
and Kinetics Allow a Differentiation
between eCL and iCL
The data presented here allow a clear
differentiation between eCL and iCL. Maximum light yields of iCL and
eCL can only be obtained under specific conditions (Figures 1, 2, and 3; and Supporting Information Figures S1.1, S1.2, and S2.1) and the reactions
exhibit different kinetics (Figures 8 and 9; and Supporting Information Figure S6). iCL requires harsh conditions
([H2O2] > 10 mM and pH > 10; Figure 3) and is of low efficiency
under mild conditions (Figure 5; Supporting Information Figure
S3). iCL kinetics are of the glow type (Figure 8) because a reaction steady state is reached
before one of the substrates (luminol or H2O2) is consumed.

eCL, in contrast, produces a maximum quantum
yield under mild conditions ([H2O2] ≤
1 mM and pH ≤ 9). eCL kinetics are mainly of the flash type
(Figure 9; and Supporting Information Figure S6) because the
heme-catalyzed reaction is of high efficiency (Figure 5; and Supporting Information Figure S3). Flash-type kinetics always suggest that at least one
essential reaction component is consumed before a reaction equilibrium
is reached. In the case of the luminol reaction, this is either H2O2 or luminol. However, with eCL, the catalyst
can also become inactivated when [H2O2] is too
high. Taken together, three different effects can cause the decay
of light emission, resulting in flash-type kinetics of eCL.

The comparison of the eCL catalysts’ efficiencies (Figure 5; and Supporting Information Figure S3) reveals that
hemin is by an order of magnitude less efficient than the heme proteins
Hb and Cyt c. This difference is largely independent
of the pH (Supporting Information Figure
S3). A possible explanation of this effect may be the dimerization
of free hemin which occurs in aqueous solutions.48 Such dimerization can alter the local electronic structure
at the Fe center and hence inhibit its catalytic efficiency.49 This, in consequence, causes less light when
luminol is the substrate of the catalyzed reaction.

Proposal: a
Modified FHW-Cycle (mFHW) Drives iCL
Although
the efficiency of free iron catalysis (iCL) is several orders of magnitude
lower at pH = 9, when compared with porphyrin-coordinated iron (Figure 5), the luminol reaction
can be used to assay trace amounts of iron or other transition metals.10,50−52 However, the precise mechanism of the iron-catalyzed
luminol–H2O2 reaction has not yet been
elucidated. An attempt to fill this gap is summarized in Figure 12. Its deduction,
all relevant reaction equations, and references are provided in the Supporting Information (SI 2.3; eqs S2.1–S2.5;
SI2.5; eqs S2.6–S2.8).

Figure 12 Possible mechanisms explaining how the
iCL luminol reaction is
catalyzed by free iron through an mFHW. (A) Free iron in aqueous solution
is able to catalyze the luminol reaction. At high pH, an oxo-ferryl
iron complex (FeIV) is formed in the presence of H2O2. FeIV has the oxidation power to
abstract electrons from luminol (LH–). The resulting
ferric iron (FeIII) is recycled, either by H2O2 producing superoxide (O2•–) or by superoxide producing molecular oxygen (Haber–Weiss
path in pink). (B) Alternatively, superoxide can possibly react with
the luminol radical (L•–) (yellow path),
directly leading to the light donor (AP*) without an azaquinone (AQ)
intermediate.

The two mechanisms (Figure 12A,B) just differ
in the final steps of the light-yielding
reaction, and they may run alternatively or even in parallel. Luminol
radicals can exchange electrons with each other (Figure 12A) to produce AQ, which reacts
with peroxide anion to AP* to yield light, and they can react with
superoxide (Figure 12B) to directly form AP* without the loop way via AQ.

Role of Superoxide
in iCL
The proposed mechanism depicted
in Figure 12B, however,
favors the interaction of the luminol radical (L•−) with superoxides (O2•–).40,53−56 The short-lived endoperoxide (details in ref (3)) is thus necessary to form
the excited AP* directly, with no AQ intermediate (Figure 12B; refs (51) and (57)) according to eq 2 2  

Scavenging of superoxide has a negative
effect on iCL (Figure 4), suggesting that superoxide is indeed involved in iCL. There are
three possible ways to explain this inhibiting effect of SOD:(1) SOD abrogates
the second route of
ferric iron (FeIII) reduction (Haber–Weiss path
in pink; Figure 12), thus limiting the pool of ferrous iron (FeII) and in
consequence, lowering the amount of active ferryl oxo-iron (FeIV).

(2) When there
is no second route of FeIII → FeII reduction
(pink in Figure 12), FeIII accumulates
and can precipitate as insoluble FeIII hydroxide, a process
which is promoted by the alkaline and aerobic molecular environment.58,59 Thus, the reaction suffers from catalyst depletion when SOD is present.
Such depletion is reduced in the presence of EDDHA (brown symbols
in Figure 4) as this
iron chelator partially prevents FeIII hydroxide precipitation.

(3) With no superoxide, luminescence
can
only be produced by L•– via the AQ intermediate
(Figure 12A). The
alternative reaction (yellow in Figure 12B), that is, the interaction of superoxide
with L•− which shortcuts the loop via AQ,
is blocked by SOD.



Role of Superoxide in eCL
The eCL reactions catalyzed
by HRP, Cyt c, and hemin show the opposite effect
when SOD is involved. The light yield increases by up to 40% in the
presence of SOD (Figure 4). This is probably an effect caused by dissolved molecular oxygen
(O2) in the assay, which is present at a concentration
of about 245 μM under equilibrium conditions, at 28 °C
and at normal atmospheric pressure (http://water.usgs.gov/software/DOTABLES/) and thus at a concentration in the same order of [H2O2] and [LH–]. Peroxidases are also
able to drive an oxygenation cycle,46,60 as already
mentioned above. Thereby, superoxide (O2•–) is produced at the price of a reduced peroxidase cycle turnover
and reduced L•– formation. In the presence
of SOD, however, the O2•– produced
is converted into H2O2 which promotes the peroxidase
cycle and thus increases L•– production and
generates more light.

Kinetic Analyses of Luminol Luminescence
Reveal Heterodyning
of iCL and eCL
The definition and distinction between glow-type
and flash-type luminescence and their kinetic modeling by mixed exponentials
is explained in the Supporting Information (SI 5; Figures S5.1–S5.5; eqs S5.2–S5.5). The kinetics
of glow-type luminescence can be modeled with a single exponential
(Supporting Information eq S5.2) leveling
off when t → ∞. The glow kinetics produced
with free iron ions (Figure 8) are well-represented by this single-exponential model (Supporting Information Figure S5.2).

Usually,
pure flash-type kinetics can be described by a single exponential
decay (Supporting Information eq S5.3;
Figure S5.3). Here, however, the flash-type kinetics are biphasic
(Figure 9; and Supporting Information Figure S6) and consequently
require at least two exponentials (Supporting Information eq S5.5; Figure S5.5). The flash kinetics of hemin,
HRP, and Hb are to some extent reflected by such a dual-exponential
function (Supporting Information Figure
S5.5). Heme-catalyzed luminescence ceases within the first minute
of the reaction with a time constant of τ ≈ 30 s (Figure 9; and Supporting Information Figure S6). This is followed
by a glow-type luminescence which may last many minutes. This strongly
suggests that iCL and eCL occur in parallel. eCL proceeds with flash
kinetics, and during this process, heme is destroyed by H2O2, liberating iron ions and so launching iCL with glow
kinetics. This view is substantiated by the results depicted in Figure 10 and in Supporting Information Figure S7, where reactions
performed at high [H2O2] and in the presence
or absence of a strong iron chelator (EDTA; pKFe = 25) are compared. In the presence of EDTA, a second exponential
in the kinetics representing the glow is missing (Figure 10; and Supporting Information Figure S7); consequently, there is
less luminescence at high [H2O2] (Figure 7; and Supporting Information Figure S4).

With a double-mixing stopped
flow system, Saha et al. (2003) showed
that flash kinetics occurred when an iron porphyrin catalyst was mixed
with luminol prior to the addition of H2O2,
whereas glow kinetics were obtained when H2O2 and the catalyst were mixed before the reaction was started with
luminol.61 A probable explanation for this
result is that the latter course of action allowed iron to be liberated
from the catalyst to produce a glow, whereas the former injection
sequence started the luminescent reaction with intact peroxidase before
iron liberation. Similar experiments were performed in the course
of this study with a plate reader-based assay. The Supporting Information (Figure S10) verifies the findings
of Saha et al. (2003)61 and underpins the
conclusions about iron liberation drawn above.

Destruction of Heme by
H2O2 as Monitored
by Soret Band Absorbance
The destruction of the iron porphyrin
complex by high [H2O2] mentioned above is directly
monitored here by the Soret peaks absorbance. The Soret peaks of all
investigated heme compounds disappear with effective peroxide concentrations
(EC50) in the range between 1 and 10 mM, giving 50% absorbance
reduction (Figure 11 and Supporting Information Figures S9.1
and S9.2). This effect is in agreement with the range of the IC50 values (Table S1) found for the
suicide inactivation effect of luminescence (Figures 1 and 2, and Supporting Information Figures S1.1 and S1.2)
and provides further evidence that heme-based catalysis of the luminol
reaction is transformed into a free iron-based catalysis when [H2O2] > 1 mM.

Conclusions
Two
different catalytic mechanisms can occur simultaneously during
a luminol reaction set up with a heme compound as the catalyst. The
first is catalysis with high light-yield efficiency and flash-type
kinetics based on the heme compound and a peroxidative cycle (eCL).
The other is catalysis based on a ferryl-oxo-iron complex with low
efficiency and glow-type kinetics (iCL). When [H2O2] is above [luminol] at pH = 9, iron is liberated from its
porphyrin coordination during the reaction. This may occur unintentionally
in quantitative luminol-based assays and thus impair their reproducibility
and precision. Thus, the design of quantitative assays based on the
luminol reaction requires careful considerations of disturbing side
effects and has to comply with a delicate balance between luminol
and H2O2 in order to avoid iron liberation from
heme and to obtain a long-lasting luminescence suitable for quantitative
intensity recording.

Impurities in the matrix of the samples
to be assayed may also
influence the reliability of luminol-based assays. In particular,
the presence of reducing agents has a pronounced effect on light yield
and kinetics, as has been demonstrated previously.3

μL of H2O2 starter solution.

For
absorbance measurements (Soret peak monitoring), transparent
MTPs were prefilled with H2O2 dilution series
