Fellutamide B is
reported to have cytotoxic and proteasome inhibitory activity. Interestingly,
fellutamide
B and its simplified analogues have also been observed for the neurotrophic
activity by stimulating the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophins.
Owing to the interesting structural and potent neurotrophic role of
fellutamide B (a lipopeptide aldehyde), we have assessed the synthetic
path intermediates (compounds A–D) of fellutamide B for their
neuroactive potential (in vitro and in vivo). We have observed few
compounds (comp #A–D) to have potential neurite outgrowth activity
in Neuro2a cells with no observable negative effect on the cell viability.
In addition, most compounds (comp #A, C, and D) have shown neurogenic
activity ex vivo in hippocampal neurosphere culture, with increased
acetyl H3 and acetyl H4 induction ability (comp #C). Furthermore,
the intermediate product comp #C has shown anxiolytic and antidepressant-like
activity in novel tank test and social interaction test, in the chronic
unpredictable stress model of zebrafish mood disorder, inducing BDNF
gene expression in the telencephalon region of the fish brain. Our
results thus demonstrate that the fellutamide B synthetic path intermediates
have potential neurotrophic, neurogenic, and mood-elevating effects
and thus good prospect to be developed as potential therapeutics to
treat psychiatric disorders.

Introduction
Neurodegenerative and
psychiatric disorders are characterized by
severe changes in brain circuitry, and recent evidences show compromised
neurotrophic milieu.1 Manipulation of brain
neurotrophicity with an endogenous or exogenous supply of neurotrophins
has shown a potential therapeutic effect in most of these cerebral
disorders.2 The exogenous administration
of neurotrophins has mitigated the maladaptive changes of the brain
by regulating neurite connections and neuroprotective3 as well as neurogenic4,5 properties. However,
therapeutic use of exogenously supplied neurotrophins has failed to
gain prominence, as it is limited by compromised pharmacokinetic properties.6 Interestingly, neurotrophic small molecules from
natural or synthetic sources are successful over the exogenous neurotrophins
and show good neuropharmacological efficacy in most brain disorders.7−9 Furthermore, small molecules are found to induce mood-elevating
(antidepressant and anxiolytic-like) effect in rodent10−12 and zebrafish models.13−15 In this direction, we and others
have focused on the exploration of novel small molecules based on
diverse natural product scaffolds and their simplified analogues for
neuroactive functions.16,17 This study is based on our effort
in evaluating fellutamide B synthetic path intermediates for their
in vitro and in vivo neuroactive properties.

Fellutamide B (a
lipopeptide aldehyde) was originally isolated
from Penicillium fellutanum,18 with reports of cytotoxicity18 and potent proteasome inhibitor activity.19,20 Subsequently, fellutamide B was also found to induce the secretion
of nerve growth factor (NGF) from fibroblasts and glioma cells. The
same conditioned media has also been shown to induce neurite outgrowth
activity in PC12 cells.20,21 Considering the suggestive
therapeutic potential of fellutamide B, our group and others have
been successful in its total synthesis22,23 (synthetic
approach) and also its simplified analogues.24 The simplified analogues of fellutamide B have proven equally effective
in NGF induction and neurite outgrowth activity in PC12 cells.24 Owing to its interesting structural features
and biological activities, we got interested in this and reported
its total synthesis23 in 2015. Initially,
it was proposed to have a 1-dodecanol long chain with benzyl protection
path (in Scheme 1),
but many challenges were encountered in the process. Interestingly,
our attempts were rewarded with the successful synthesis of key intermediates
A–D (Figure 1). Inspired by the neuroactive role of fellutamide B simplified analogues,
we initiated the evaluation of these fellutamide B synthetic path
intermediates for their in vitro (neuritogenic), ex vivo (neurogenic),
and in vivo (zebrafish behavior for antidepressant and anxiolytic-like)
neuroactive functions. The study was undertaken to develop few potential
neuroactive drugs based on the natural product scaffold.

Figure 1 Compound structures.

Scheme 1 Retrosynthetic Analysis
Results
Chemistry
The retrosynthetic approach (Scheme 1) for the target compound was
planned from two key advanced intermediates, fragment 3 and tripeptide fragment 2.

Retro Synthesis
The initial route starting from natural
amino acids 4, 5, 5a, and 6 and benzyl protected long chain of 1-decanol were engaged
as depicted below.

In the synthesis, fragment 3 was taken up (Scheme 2) using asymmetric allylation of 1-decanal in the presence of allyltributyltin
under the influence of in situ generation of (S,S)-bis-Ti(IV)-oxide in dichloromethane at 0 °C for
12 h, affording the homoallylic secondary alcohol 7 in
79% yield.25 Then, treatment of 7 with NaH and BnBr-mediated protection in tetrahydrofuran (THF) produced
the corresponding protected alcohol 8 in 92% yield. Further
oxidative cleavage26 of 8 terminal
olefin in the presence of NaIO4 and RuCl3·H2O in CCl4/MeCN/H2O (2:2:3) furnished
the required acid fragment 3 in 70% yield, which was
immediately used for coupling reaction without further identification.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Fragment 3
Synthesis of Fragment 3
On the other hand,
to synthesize compound D (Scheme 3), S-leucinol 6 was subjected
to TBSCl, Et3N-mediated protection in CH2Cl2, furnishing the corresponding protected amino alcohol 9 in 88% yield. Compound 9 was directly subjected
to N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride, 1-hydroxybenzotriazole,
and i-Pr2NEt-mediated peptide coupling27,28 with Cbz-protected L-glutamine 10a and Boc-protected glutamine 5 in CH2Cl2 to obtain compound 10 in 79% and 10a in 86% yield, respectively. Hydrogenation of 10 with
10% Pd/C in EtOH gave compound 11 in 85% yield, opening
the handle for the next attachment.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Fragments
A–D
After purification,
compound 11 was directly used
for second peptide coupling with Cbz-protected L-asparagine 4 in dimethylformamide and furnished the awaited compound
C in 82% yield. Subsequent hydrogenation of C using 10%
Pd/C in EtOH produced the desired fragment 12 in 65%
yield, which was directly coupled with fragment 3 to
obtain compound D in 75% yield.

Finally, with compound D, debenzylation
followed by oxidation of
primary alcohol to aldehyde, or oxidation of primary alcohol to aldehyde
followed by debenzylation, was unsuccessful to achieve target compound
fellutamide B (1) in their route.

(Comp #A–D)-Induced Neurite Outgrowth
Activity in Neuro2a Cells
Fellutamide B synthetic route intermediates
(comp #A–D)
(Figure 1) at different
concentrations (100–1 μM) were tested for neurite outgrowth
activity in differentiated (serum-deprived) Neuro2a cells. Compounds
(comp #A–D) at respective optimum neuritogenic concentrations
(50 μM) induced significantly more neurite outgrowth (comp #A—158.3
μm, #B—149.92 μm, #C—159.38 μm, and
#D—153.48 μm) (p < 0.001) than vehicle
(1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)) (76.13 μm)-treated cells (Figure 2A,B). Furthermore,
the optimum neurite outgrowth of (comp #A–D) is significantly
higher compared to vehicle treatment, similar to the levels observed
in positive control groups: nerve growth factor (NGF) (165.98 μm)
and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (128.33 μm) (p < 0.001) (Figure 3A,B).

Effect of Compounds (Comp #A–D) on the Viability of Neuro2a
Cells
For the potential therapeutic value, the novel compounds
studied should have no toxicity. For this, the effect of compounds
was assessed on the cell viability using Neuro2a cells, at the optimum
neurite outgrowth concentration (50 μM). The results showed
no significant cytotoxicity compared to the vehicle (1% DMSO) treatment
(Figure 4).

Neurogenic Potential of
Compounds (Comp #A–D) in ex Vivo
Neurosphere Assay
The neurogenesis potential has been shown
to be affected in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, including
chronic stress models,29−32 and this potential is assessed using ex vivo neurosphere culture
assay.33 Therefore, to evaluate the neurogenic
ability of compounds (comp #A–D), the hippocampi were removed
from neonatal mice, and the hippocampal neural stem and/or progenitor
cells (NSCs/NPCs) collected therefrom were grown in the culture medium
as neurospheres. The effects of all of the compounds (comp #A–D)
were studied at various concentrations (1.0–0.01 μM)
for induction of neurosphere formation in NSCs/NPCs, resulting in
moderately sized neurospheres (>100 μm). Treatment with comp
#A, C, and D, but not #B, at the lowest concentration tested (0.01 μM)
resulted in a significantly greater number of neurospheres compared
to the vehicle-treated cells (p < 0.05) (Figure 5A,B).

Anxiolytic and Antidepressant
Efficacy of Comp #C in Chronic
Stress-Induced Zebrafish Model
Since anxiety, depression,
and related stress-induced mood disorders are characterized by attenuation
in neurotrophic and neurogenic milieu,34−38 one of these highly neurotrophic and proneurogenic
compounds (which induces bigger neurosphere formation), comp #C, was
tested in vivo in zebrafish mood disorder model. To assess the anxiolytic
and antidepressant-like effect of comp #C, novel tank test (NTT) and
social interaction test were performed using chronic unpredictable
stress (CUS)-induced zebrafish anxiety and related mood disorder model,39 as described in detail in the Experimental section. Before treatment
with the compound, the animals were exposed to CUS paradigm, and the
data from NTT and social interaction test were analyzed to see whether
CUS induces a phenotypic response (i.e., anxiety- and depression-like
condition). Anxiety-like phenotype was observed as assessed in NTT,
such as significantly higher latency to reach upper zone, less amount
of time spent in the upper zone, decreased number of crosses by animals,
and high freezing duration (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 1A–D). Depression-like
phenotype was clearly observed after assessing the animals in the
social interaction test; zebrafish subjected to CUS exhibited remarkably
less time in interaction with the target fish (p <
0.05) (Supplementary Figure 2A) and showed
increase in total freezing duration, too, another hallmark of depressed
fish (p < 0.05) (Supplementary Figure 2B). Once the fish started showing mood disorder phenotype,
the animals were divided into different groups and treated with vehicle,
comp #C, and the antidepressant fluoxetine, the positive control,
as described below.

Novel Tank Test
Zebrafish were subjected
to CUS, followed
by treatment with vehicle, comp #C at 5 and 50 mg/kg dose, and the
antidepressant fluoxetine, positive control, and the behavior data
from the NTT were analyzed. CUS resulted in higher latency to the
upper zone (Figure 6A), indicating anxiety-like condition. The high latency to upper
zone in the CUS group was restored to the level observed in control
unstressed animals upon treatment with the lower dose of comp #C (5
mg/kg) and fluoxetine (p < 0.05); the vehicle
treatment group still had higher latency as in CUS group (Figure 6A).

group (Student’s t-test), #p < 0.05 compared to CUS + vehicle group (one-way ANOVA
using GraphPad Prism software).

On analyzing another parameter in the NTT, i.e., the total
time
spent in the upper zone of the novel tank, CUS led to significantly
less time spent in the upper zone (Figure 6B), indicating anxiety. This feature was
restored back to control level upon treatment with comp #C (at 5 mg/kg
dose and not 50 mg) as well as fluoxetine, i.e., increase in time
spent in the upper zone (Figure 6B). The same trend was observed when another parameter,
i.e., number of crosses, was analyzed (Figure 6C). Previous studies have shown freezing
during the NTT in stressed zebrafish, indicating mood disorder.39,40 Our analysis along similar lines in total freezing duration in all
of the groups does not show a significant difference between the groups,
rather suggesting a trend in the same direction as seen in the anxiety
parameter, latency to upper zone, described above (Figure 6D).

Social Interaction Test
Comp #C was administered at
5 and 50 mg/kg dose to CUS-subjected fish, and the efficacy on depression-like
behavior was assessed through the social interaction test. Compound-induced
changes in the total time spent in the interaction zone and in freezing
behavior were recorded. The group treated with comp #C at 5 mg/kg,
but not 50 g/kg dose, showed remarkably more time spent in the interaction
zone like the fluoxetine-treated group compared to the vehicle-treated
group (p < 0.05) (Figure 7A). Furthermore, comp #C (5 mg/kg, but not
50 g/kg)-treated group has shown a decreased trend in the freezing
duration (not statistically significant), similar to that observed
in the fluoxetine (15 mg/kg)-treated group (Figure 7B).

and 50 mg/kg)- and

Efficacy of Comp #C on
Gene Expression of an Important Neurotrophin
Brain (BDNF)-Derived Neurotrophic Factor
From the neurotrophin
or neurotrophic factor family, BDNF has been shown to play a critical
role in maintaining proper neural functions.38,41,42 An attenuation in its level in brain circuitry
is observed in animal models of neuropsychiatric disorders, including
depression, anxiety, and related mood disorders.43−45 The treatment
of animal models with antidepressants and anxiolytics has been shown
to increase its level in the affected circuitry.46,47 Therefore, the change in the level of BDNF gene expression in the
telencephalon of stress-exposed zebrafish was assessed after the treatment
with comp #C (5 and 50 mg/kg doses) and the positive control fluoxetine
(15 mg/kg), the most prescribed antidepressant. Interestingly, only
at low doses (compared to vehicle group) comp #C increased the level
of BDNF gene expression (p < 0.05) in the brain
area investigated, similar to the fluoxetine-treated group (Figure 8).

chain reaction (PCR) data. Induction of mRNA

ANOVA using GraphPad Prism software) compared to CUS + vehicle group.

Compound-Induced Histone
H3 and H4 Acetylation Changes in Neuro2a
Cells
Recent studies show the involvement of histone acetylation-based
epigenetic mechanisms in brain circuitry that gets affected in animal
models of chronic stress-induced depression, anxiety, and related
disorders.10,48 Attenuation of histone H3 and/or
H4 acetylation is associated with compromised neurotrophic and neurogenic
features, including BDNF downregulation in animal models of neuropsychiatric
disorders, where increasing acetylation levels has shown amelioration
in the condition.49−52 Keeping this in mind, we assessed the change in H3 and H4 acetylation
levels in differentiated mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a after
the comp #C treatment. Treatment of cells with neuritogenic concentrations
of comp #C (100, 50, and 10 μM) resulted in an increased level
of acetyl H3 (Figure 9A,C). In addition, comp #C (50 and 10 μM) significantly induced
the acetylated H4 level in Neuro2a cells compared to vehicle (DMSO)
treatment (Figure 9A,B). We have also observed increased acetylation levels of H3 and
H4 at neurogenic concentrations of comp #C in undifferentiated IMR32
cells (Supplementary Figure 3).

Discussion
Most
of the neuropsychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety,
and related mood disorders, are associated with attenuation in neurotrophic
and neurogenic activity.53−56 Therefore, laboratories across the world are trying
to develop small molecules of natural and synthetic origin with the
ability to promote neurite outgrowth and neurogenesis for developing
therapeutics to treat these brain and behavioral disorders. In this
direction, we too have focused on developing repertoires of neuroactive
simplified small molecules based on natural product scaffolds. Fellutamide
B is one such promising molecule that gained prominence owing to its
neurotrophic activity,20,21 in addition to its other bioactive
properties.18,19 Other groups have recently synthesized
fellutamide B and its simplified analogues and showed their neurite
growth-enhancing activity.19 These reports
led us to synthesize fellutamide B, and in this process, we got rewarded
with four intermediate products, compounds A–D (shown in Figure 1), which interestingly
showed good neurotrophic or neurite growth-promoting activity in Neuro2a
cells, at levels similar to those reported by others for fellutamide
B and its analogues. Thereafter, these compounds were tested for neurogenic
potential in ex vivo neurosphere assay. Except for comp #B, most of
these small molecules showed potent neurogenic activity in mouse hippocampal
neural stem/progenitor cells (Figure 5A,B), as much as was shown by few diverse naturally
derived small molecules57,58 and their scaffolds8 that have been recently reported by us.

Finally, using zebrafish CUS model for depression and related mood
disorders,39,59−61 where both
neurotrophic and neurogenic activities are compromised, one of these
potent intermediate compounds, comp #C, showed potent mood-elevating
role as an anxiolytic and antidepressant. To our knowledge, we are
the first to report small molecules sharing structure similarity with
fellutamide B that have remarkable therapeutic potential in depression
and related mood disorders. This in vivo effect of comp #C appears
to be in part due to BDNF induction in the zebrafish telencephalon.
Since comp #C also acts epigenetically (as shown by its enhancing
effect on H3 and H4 acetylation in mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a),
we suggest that the mood-elevating effects of this novel compound
could partly be attributed to its epigenetic action, too.

In
conclusion, we have demonstrated that novel small-molecule pathway
intermediates of fellutamide B are interesting compounds with potent
neurotrophic and neurogenic actions. One of these, i.e., comp #C,
also showed robust mood-elevating effects in a zebrafish CUS mood
disorder model by enhancing the levels of the critical neurotrophin
BDNF, owing to which it can be taken up for the next level of preclinical
drug discovery. In future, designing of analogues around the comp
#C structural framework might lead us to identify more potential novel
small molecules for developing therapeutics to treat depression and
related mood disorders.

Experimental Section
Chemistry
All
of the chemicals were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and were directly used without further purification;
anhydrous reactions were performed in oven-dried round-bottom flasks
under a dry argon atmosphere. Air and moisture-sensitive compounds
were introduced via syringes or cannulae using standard inert atmosphere
techniques. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) using E. Merck silica gel plates, and components were visualized
by illumination with short-wavelength UV light and/or staining (ninhydrin, p-anisaldehyde, or basic KMnO4). All reagents
were used as they were received from commercial suppliers, unless
otherwise noted. Technical-grade ethyl acetate, hexanes, chloroform,
and methanol used for column chromatography were distilled prior to
use. THF and Et2O were dried in the presence of sodium
metal using benzophenone as an indicator and distilled prior to use.
Anhydrous CH2Cl2 was prepared by refluxing in
the presence of CaH2 and distilled right before use. Optical
rotations were measured with a digital polarimeter using a 2 mL cell
with a 1 dm path length. Fourier transform infrared spectra were recorded
as KBr disks or neat. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded in CDCl3 or DMSO-d6 on 300 and 500 MHz spectrometers. The residual peak of CHCl3 was set at 7.26 ppm for 1H NMR spectroscopy, and
the central peak of CDCl3 was set at 77.0 ppm for 13C NMR spectroscopy. All products were purified by flash column
chromatography on silica gel (60–120 mesh and 100–200
mesh).

Cell Culture Maintenance
Neuro2a (mouse neuroblastoma)
and IMR32 (human neuroblastoma) cell lines were procured from the
American Type Culture Collection. These cell lines (Neuro2a and IMR32)
were maintained in complete media containing Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) (Gibco), penicillin/streptomycin (1%), sodium pyruvate (1×),
and nonessential amino acids solution (1×), at 37 °C in
a humidified atmosphere supplemented with 5% CO2. For differentiation
experiments, cells were grown in culture media with reduced serum
(DMEM + 1% FBS).

Neurite Outgrowth Assay
Neurite
outgrowth activity
assay was performed as reported.62 Briefly,
Neuro2a cells were seeded at low density (8000 cells/cm2) in six-well plates. After 24 h, the cells were allowed to differentiate
in culture media containing reduced serum levels (DMEM + 1% FBS).
After 6 h, the cells were incubated with different concentrations
of compounds (100–1 μM) and were observed for neurite
outgrowth activity. Bright-field images of Neuro2a cells treated with
different concentrations of compounds were used to measure the neurite
outgrowth activity. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde
in 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and used for immunocytochemical
studies. To evaluate the compound-induced neurite growth changes,
the average neurite length for each treatment was measured (using
ImageJ software) considering 60 neurons from six microscopic fields
that randomly captured two images per well from three independent
experiments.

Cell Viability Assay
The cell viability
assay was performed
as previously reported62 to assess the
effects of compounds on cell viability in Neuro2a cells.

Neurosphere
Assay
The neurosphere assay was performed
as published previously16 to evaluate the
neurogenic potential of compounds.

Immunocytochemistry
Neuro2a and IMR32 cells, incubated
with different concentrations of compounds, were processed for the
immunostaining following our earlier protocol.38,62 Briefly, fixation of the cells after incubation with different treatments
has been done with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 15
min. It is followed by permeabilization with 0.5% Triton X-100 and
0.05% Tween 20 in 1× PBS, then incubation for 2 h at room temperature
in blocking buffer (2% bovine serum albumin + 0.1% Triton X-100 in
1× PBS). Primary antibodies against β III tubulin (1:200,
Millipore), H3 acetylation (1:100), and H4 acetylation (1:100) were
used. The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C with primary
antibody in the blocking buffer. The samples were washed with PBST
(PBS with 0.1% Tween 20) and incubated with goat antimouse IgG conjugated
to AlexaFlour 488 (1:400, Molecular Probes) and anti-rabbit Cy3 (1:1000).
A Motic AE31 microscope was used for capturing the cell images.

Immunoblot
Neuro2a cells were treated with different
concentrations of compounds and vehicle. The cells incubated with
different treatments were washed with 1× PBS and harvested in
1× laemmli sample buffer. The cell lysate total protein relative
concentration estimated with amido black method and an equal amount
of protein was loaded onto 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis gel. Blocking was done for 1 h at room temperature,
followed by incubation with primary antibodies H3 acetyl (1:1000),
H4 acetyl (1:2000), and H3 PAN (1:3000) overnight at 4 °C. The
blots were washed with 1× PBST, and incubation in secondary antibody
anti-rabbit (1:5000) was done at room temperature for 1 h. The blots
were again washed with 1× PBST and then developed with the Bio-Rad
ChemiDoc instrument using WesternBright ECL solution (advansta). The
band intensities of Western blots were measured using ImageJ software.

RNA Isolation and Gene Expression Analysis by Real-Time Quantitative
PCR (qPCR)
Total RNA was isolated from telencephalon brain
regions pooled from four zebrafish brain and stored at −80
°C. Total RNA isolation, deoxyribonuclease I enzyme treatment,
cDNA synthesis, and qPCR were performed according to the previously
published protocol.63 The expression levels
of BDNF and the house-keeping or reference gene GAPDH were measured
using qPCR. After normalization with the transcript levels of GAPDH,
the fold change in the BDNF transcript was calculated using the ΔΔCt
methods. The GAPDH Ct values were stable in all of the conditions
and experiments. The primers used for qPCR analysis were (BDNF F-ATAGGGGAAAATGTTCCAACAGG,
R-CCCGGGATCTCTCTCATGG) (GAPDH F-GAGGCTTCTCACAAACGAGGA, R-TGGCCACGATCTCCACTTTC).

Animals and Housing
Adult zebrafish (Danio
rerio) bred and raised in captivity were used
for the behavioral and molecular experiments. The zebrafish used for
the experiments were raised in large tanks with a natural day light/dark
cycle and two feedings, until they arrived in the laboratory. In the
fish facility of the lab, zebrafish procured were acclimatized to
the experimental room conditions by maintaining them at 28 ±
2 °C, 14/10 h light/dark cycle, three feedings, and constant
aeration. After the habituation period, the fish were separated into
two groups as control and test sets and the test animals were subjected
to two different stressors per day for a period of 7 days. Fish that
exhibited stress-induced phenotypic changes, assessed by novel tank
test and social interaction test, were treated intraperitoneally for
4 days with the indicated dose: comp #C 5, 50 mg/kg, and fluoxetine,
15 mg/kg. Following the behavioral testing (before and after the compound
and positive control fluoxetine treatment), all fish were euthanized
and the telencephalon regions were immediately dissected out and stored
at −84 °C for further studies. All animal procedures were
done according to the protocol approved by the Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee (IAEC/IICT/Protocol No.26/2016).

Chronic Unpredictable
Stress (CUS) Paradigm in Zebrafish
CUS paradigm to induced
depression, anxiety, and related mood disorder
phenotype was performed with small modifications to the previously
published protocol.39 For a period of 7
days, the fish were subjected to a variety of chronic stressors with
two stressors per day (forenoon and afternoon), such as restrain stress
(RS), heat stress (HS), cold stress (CS), social isolation (SI), overcrowding
(OC), predator stress (PS), dorsal body exposure (DBE), tank change
(TC), chasing (C), and alarm pheromone stress (APS). Restrain stress
(RS): each animal was restrained for 1 h in a 2 mL microcentrifuge
tube with perforations at both the ends for free water flow; heat
stress (HS) and cold stress (CS): animals were transferred to new
tanks maintained at 33 and 23 °C, respectively, for 30 min; social
isolation (SI): in separate beakers for 60 min; overcrowding (OC):
10 animals in a 250 mL beaker containing only 150 mL of water, for
60 min; predator stress (PS): test animals exposed to predators’
(cichlid fish) encounters (chases and attacks) for 1 min; dorsal body
exposure (DBE): animals in housing tanks with low water level to expose
the animal dorsal body for 2 min; tank change (TC): transferred from
one tank to another about six consecutive times; chasing (C): chased
with a net for 8 min; and alarm pheromone stress (APS): the test fish
was exposed for about 30 min to water containing the washing of epidermal
cells from the euthanized/sliced zebrafish. To avoid habituation to
stressors, unpredictability was maintained by changing the time and
sequence of stressors daily, during 7 days of the stress paradigm.
Aeration and temperature were controlled during the presentation of
each stressor, except during heating and cooling stress. The nonstressed
control group was maintained in the same room during the 7 day stress
period.

Behavior Test
Novel Tank Test (NTT)
NTT was performed
as previously
reported.39 Briefly, zebrafish were placed
individually in a narrow 15 × 12 × 25 cm3 tank
with a water depth of 18 cm, which is divided into three equal horizontal
sections (bottom, middle, and upper zones) with virtual lines. In
the 2 min novel tank test, the time spent by the fish in different
levels of the tank (bottom, middle, or upper level) was measured to
assess the level of anxiety. A preference for the tank bottom and
less frequent venturing in and time spent in the middle and upper
levels of the tank is suggestive of increased anxiety. Similarly,
longer latency to enter the middle and upper levels of the tank, less
number of crosses (measure of exploratory drive), and high freezing
duration are indicative of anxiety and related behavior phenotype.

Social Interaction Test
It is well reported that depression
affects the social behavior of the animals exposed to chronic stressful
conditions.64 The social avoidance behavior
of the stressed zebrafish, indicative of depression-like phenotype,
was assessed by the social interaction test based on the approach
and interaction behavior toward an unfamiliar conspecific target (pink-colored
zebrafish) as reported.33 Briefly, experimental
zebrafish were introduced into the tank with the target in the interaction
box for 120 s, a conspecific pink-colored zebrafish served as a target
animal in the interaction zone. The entire test was video-recorded
with a Sony Handycam Camcorder 200E in HD mode, and the data were
scored manually. The depression-like phenotype was assessed by evaluating
the duration of interaction and also the freezing duration.

Statistical Analysis
The results were expressed as
mean ± standard error of the mean from three independent experiments.
Data were appropriately subjected to either two-tailed paired Student’s t-test or ANOVA, followed by Tukey’s post hoc analysis,
using GraphPad Prism software. A value of p <
0.05 was considered statistically significant.
