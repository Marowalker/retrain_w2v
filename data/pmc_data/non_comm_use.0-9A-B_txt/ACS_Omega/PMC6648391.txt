The racemization process of various
1,1′-binaphthyl derivatives
is studied by quantum calculations. The preferred racemization pathway
passes through a transition state belonging to the Ci symmetry group. The energy barrier for this process is
independent of solvation, the electron-withdrawing/releasing power
of substituents, or their ability to engage in H-bonds within the
molecule. The primary factor is instead the substituent size. The
barrier is thus reduced when the −OH groups of 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol
are replaced by H. There is a drop in the barrier also when the substituents
are moved from the 2,2′ positions to 6,6′, where they
will not come close to one another in the transition state. Upon removal
of the peripheral aromatic rings of the binaphthyl system, the biphenyl
system undergoes a facile racemization. It is concluded that the optimal
means of improving optical stability of 1,1′-binaphthyl systems
is the substitution of large bulky groups in the 2,2′ positions.

Introduction
Due to its high optical
stability, molecules containing the 1,1′-binaphthyl
skeleton (Figure 1)
have found wide applications in various enantioselective processes
for several decades. In particular, 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol (or
BINOL) is widely used for asymmetric catalysis,1,2 for
chiral recognition processes,3 and as a
progenitor of chiral binaphthyl polymers.4 Over the past half century, a huge number of effective methods have
been developed to obtain optically pure BINOL isomers, including those
utilizing chemical5−7 and enzymatic resolution of racemic BINOLs,8−10 as well as various catalytic procedures implementing Cu-,11−13 V-,14−16 Ru-,17 and Fe-based18,19 catalysts for direct asymmetric oxidative coupling of 2-naphthols.

The high optical stability of these molecules revolves
around the
high energy barrier for their racemization. However, despite the wide
use of binaphthyl derivatives, the racemization process of these compounds
has not been fully explored. There have been some computational efforts
in this direction.20−26 In 1963, Cooke and Harris suggested two possible anti pathways of
the racemization process of 1,1′-binaphthyl derivatives.35 Later, Carter and Liljefors
introduced two possible syn pathways.24 However, these racemization routes were investigated only via very
approximate molecular mechanics and semiempirical methods. The computationally
predicted value of the racemization barrier for the anti-Ci TS of 1,1′-binaphthalene lies in the 18.3–24.8
kcal/mol interval, depending upon the level of theory. The most recent
and accurate result (23.0 kcal/mol) was obtained using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p)
level of theory.22 Previous theoretical
analyses agree that the anti-Ci pathway
is preferred. Schleyer and co-workers made the assumption that the
distortion of the aromatic rings makes the greatest contribution to
the activation energy of the process,21 which was echoed later by Havlas et al.22 Experimental measurements of the optical stability of 1,1′-binaphthyl22,27−30 in different solvents suggest only slight sensitivity of the racemization
energy barrier to the particular solvent, varying in the narrow range
between 23.5 and 24.1 kcal/mol. For the −OH-substituted 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol,
the activation free energy of the racemization process in naphthalene
and diphenyl ether is a bit higher, at 37.2 and 37.8 kcal/mol, respectively.

There remain some interesting and fundamental question as to why
this barrier is so high. Is this an electronic effect or is it related
to the steric interactions during racemization? Are there present
any noncovalent interactions that impede or facilitate the conversion
from one optical isomer to another? What is the precise path of molecular
arrangement that accompanies the racemization? What sorts of substituents
might compromise the optical stability by lowering the barrier, or
might add to it via raising the barrier even higher?

The current
work describes a quantum chemical investigation of
these questions. A thorough examination of the entire potential energy
surface leads to the likely racemization pathway and elucidates the
structure of the transition state along this reaction profile. Various
substituents are added that allow identification of the components
that contribute to the racemization barrier and suggest modifications
of the molecular skeleton that would add to or subtract from the optical
stability.

Methods
Full geometry optimizations were performed
at various levels of
theory. For 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol geometry optimization and frequency
calculations (harmonic approximation), three density functional theory
(DFT) methods were used (PBE0,32 B3LYP,33−35 and TPSSh36) with Pople augmented basis
set 6-311+G*. For a more accurate accounting of electron correlation,
the MP4/cc-pVDZ//B3LYP/6-311+G* level of theory was implemented. Transition
state structures were identified using a synchronous transit-guided
quasi-Newton method.31 Optimization of
displaced geometry along the reaction coordinate ensured that each
transition state truly refers to the racemization process. For investigating
substituent effects, the B3LYP/6-311+G* level of theory was applied.
All energies in this work are presented with the zero-point energy
(ZPE) corrections included. (Coordinates of optimized geometries are
contained in the Supporting Information (SI) as well as energetics without ZPE correction and free energies.)
All calculations utilized the Gaussian-0937 and Gaussian-1638 programs. The ChemCraft
1.8 program was used for structure visualization. Charge transfer
between individual orbitals was measured by the natural bond orbital
(NBO) protocol.39,40 Atoms in molecules (AIM) procedures41,42 as implemented in the MultiWFN code were used for the elucidation
of bonding paths between atoms and for the quantification of the electron
density at bond critical points.

Results and Discussion
To facilitate discussion of the results, the following notation
is adopted. The peripheral six-membered rings are those not engaged
in a covalent bond between the two naphthyl systems, containing C5–C8
and C5′–C8′ (Figure 1). When these two peripheral rings lie on
the same side of the C1–C1′ bond, as they do in Figure 1, this sort of geometry
is designated as syn. A 180° rotation around the C1–C1′
bond results in an antistructure. In addition to this general distinction,
there is also the precise symmetry adopted by the transition state
along the pathway. The four transition state geometries for the BINOL
molecule are displayed in Figure 2, along with their designations, which include the
TS point group. (The same notation was used in a previous study of
binaphthyl racemization pathways.22) It
should be added that in some cases the presence of substituents will
remove the strict symmetry described above, but this notation will
be applied nonetheless for purposes of consistency.

racemization pathways of BINOL.

Given the freedom of rotation around the −OH bonds
of BINOL,
the three most likely isomers of this molecule are illustrated in Figure 3 for the (R)-enantiomer.43 One would anticipate that isomer A ought to be the most stable, containing as it does the possibility
of two internal OH···O
H-bonds. Indeed, calculations confirm A to be more stable
than B, with its single such H-bond by 3.8, and C by 6.9 kcal/mol since the latter contains no such bond.
Transformation between the isomers in Figure 3 is facile. The energy barrier for B collapsing to A is only 1.7 kcal/mol, whereas
there is no effective barrier for the transition from C to B.

Figure 3 Isomers of (R)-1,1′-bi-2-naphthol.

Even though C is
unlikely to exist in any large proportion,
and the transition from B to A requires
surmounting only a small barrier, in the interest of thoroughness,
the barriers to racemization were calculated for all three isomers
and are listed in Table 1. A first observation concerns the insensitivity of the data to the
level of theory. The barrier to conversion of the A isomer
through the anti-Ci transition state,
for example, lies in the narrow range between 37.0 and 39.7 kcal/mol
regardless of the DFT functional or the incorporation of electron
correlation via any level of Møller–Plesset perturbation
(MPn) theory.

a All energies are indicated relative

with geometries optimized at noted levels.

It may be noted that not all of the starting isomers
pass through
each of the four possible transition states. Isomer A, for example, pass through only the anti-Ci and syn-C2 transition states. However,
in any case, the overall conclusion is that the preferred pathway
lies through the anti-Ci structure, with
a barrier of just under 40 kcal/mol. This finding conforms to an earlier
hypothesis.22 It is noteworthy that energy
barriers of each of the different isomers are roughly the same. One
may presume that, given the low energy barrier separating B from A, the most likely racemization process of the
former would take it through A and its anti-Ci transition state.

These energetics of the
various conversion routes are presented
graphically in Figure 4, in which the energies of the various pathways can be directly compared.
The energy of the anti-Ci transition state
for the A isomer lies lower by 7.1 kcal/mol as compared
to that of the same symmetry transition state for the C structure. To probe the reasons for this energy advantage, both
AIM and NBO were applied to the two structures. Figure 5 indicates the position of a pair of bond
paths connecting the OH proton with the C atom of the phenyl ring
of A. These paths are replaced in C by a
similar pair in which it is the hydroxyl O atom that connects with
the phenyl C atom. The AIM analysis might term these interactions
a OH···C H-bond and a O···C tetrel bond,
respectively. The electron densities for the bond critical points
in the A TS are equal to 0.0241 and 0.0195, which compared to 0.0217
for both of the C bond paths are quite similar. The NBO
analysis suggests a significant degree of charge transfer (with E(2)=1.97 kcal/mol) from a π(CC) bonding orbital of
the phenyl ring to the σ*(OH) bond in the A TS,
indicative of a OH···π H-bond. For the C isomer, a charge transfer (E(2)=1.63 kcal/mol)
occurs from the O lone pair to the π*(CC) of the phenyl ring,
which is likely attributable to a tetrel bond. These results suggest
that the difference in energy between the A and C transition states is not due to these intramolecular contacts
but due to some other factors, as described below.

isomers and transition states, calculated

It is important to consider the
optical stability of BINOL not
just in vacuo but also in a solvent environment. Accordingly, the
energies of the two transition states of the A isomer
were assessed in two different solvents. The dielectric constants
of diphenyl ether and N,N-dimethylformamide
are equal to 3.73 ad 37.22, respectively, thus representing a fairly
wide range of this parameter. Within the context of the former solvent,
the energies of the anti-Ci and syn-C2 transition states, relative to the optimized A isomer, are 39.6 and 43.3 kcal/mol, respectively, quite
similar to the gas phase values of 39.3 and 43.2 kcal/mol. Increasing
the dielectric constant to 37.2 also has a little effect, with activation
barriers of 39.8 and 43.3 kcal/mol. The insensitivity of this quantity
to solvation suggests that there is little differentiation between
the equilibrium and transition state structures in terms of charge
separation, adding to the argument that electronic effects are not
a primary factor in the barrier to racemization.

Substituents
To
probe this issue more deeply, the next
question arises with regard to the effect of the −OH groups
of the BINOL molecule upon its optical stability. By removing these
groups, one can obtain a pure representation of the rotational profile
of the basic 1,1′-binaphthyl skeleton. Similarly, by replacing
−OH with a number of other groups, it would be possible to
learn about how both electronic and steric effects might enter into
the picture. As the calculations of BINOL at various levels described
above have shown little sensitivity to the level of theory, the following
results were extracted from application of B3LYP/6-311+G*, which nicely
reproduces the data from more complete calculations.

The nature
of the potential energy surface is such that the search for transition
states is not always successful. It was only possible to identify
such geometries for certain substituents for the anti-C2 structure, whereas none could be found for syn-Cs. However, even with the incomplete set of
data presented in Table 2, it is nonetheless possible to extract key features of the sensitivity
of the activation energy to the nature of the substituent. Considering
the anti-Ci data in the first row of the
table, the removal of the −OH substituent, replacing it by
H, drops the barrier to roughly half its value. On the other hand,
all of the substituents are associated with barriers in the surprisingly
narrow range of 36.5–43.5 kcal/mol. There is little correlation
between the barrier and electron-withdrawing or -releasing character
of R. For example, the strongly electron-releasing −NH2 shows nearly the identical barrier as the electron-withdrawing
−NO2. It would appear, then, that the dominating
characteristic is the size of the substituent. Previous theoretical
results obtained for large substituents are consistent with this assumption
(computed rotational barriers for 2,2′-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1′-binaphthyl
and 2-amino-2′-hydroxy-1,1′-binaphthyl are 49.444 and 40.445 kcal/mol,
respectively). The barrier for H is by far the lowest, whereas the
highest barrier occurs for the bulky phenyl group. The relatively
small size of the monatomic F leads to the lowest barrier (with the
exception of H of course). Very similar trends are observed in the
case of the syn-C2 transition states.
Qualitatively, such behavior is consistent with the B parameter proposed by Schlosser.46 The
main idea of this approach is to rank substituents as a function of
steric congestion. Following this concept, one could predict the relative
energy of rotational barrier for 2,2′ disubstituted 1,1′-binaphthyls.

By placing
the substituent on the peripheral pair of rings, the
ones that do not form covalent attachment between the two naphthyl
systems, it is possible to examine electronic effects without the
strong influence of steric factors. The effects of 6,6′ substitution
upon the racemization barriers are reported in Table 3. Again, the identification of transition
states for the syn-C2 geometry was difficult,
leading to second-order stationary points. However, the data for the
anti-Ci and syn-C2 are unambiguous. As above for the 2,2′ substitution,
the barriers for R=H are the smallest, but by less of a margin,
only by 5 kcal/mol or so. Within the other substituents, the sensitivity
to either electron-withdrawing power or even substituent size has
all but disappeared. The barrier for the bulky Ph group is in fact
even slightly smaller than that for the other R. In fact, what small
differences that do occur are due not to the electronic energies but
rather to zero-point vibrations. When the latter are removed, and
it is only the electronic energies that are considered, the activation
energies are virtually identical, even including R=H. Placement
of the F substituent pair into the 3,3′ and 7,7′ positions
leads to data quite similar to values in Table 3 for 6.6′.

Given what
is apparently a dominating influence of steric repulsions
on the racemization process, it is tempting to consider how this process
would be affected if the peripheral rings were removed entirely, leaving
only the 2,2′-biphenyl system. As one interesting difference,
the transition states to the racemization of the smaller bisphenol
system contain a pair of completely flat rings. That is, the ring
nonplanarity, that is characteristic of the binaphthyl transition
states, vanishes along with the peripheral rings. Second, and perhaps
more importantly, the barriers to racemization are dramatically lowered.
The barriers drop from 19.5 and 39.3 kcal/mol for binaphthyl and 1,1′-bi-2-naphthol,
respectively, down to 2.4 and 11.2 kcal/mol for the corresponding
biphenyl and 2,2′-biphenol. The removal of the peripheral rings,
and the steric hindrance that they bring, thus reduces the optical
stability of this system.

Since the major deformation of the
aromatic system occurs in the
phenyl rings that are directly attached to one another, the dihedral
angle θ(1–9–4–3), shown in Figure 6, was taken as a measure of
this nonplanarity. This angle would be 0° for a completely planar
system. The dihedral angle φ(2–1–1′–2′)
characterizes the relative orientations of the two aromatic systems.

Figure 6 Dihedral
angles θ, shown by green dotted lines, and φ
representing the relative orientation of two aromatic systems.

The values of these angles are
displayed in Table 4 for the anti-Ci and syn-C2 transition state structures
with various substituents. φ is equal to 180° for the anti-Ci pathway for all cases except −OH(2,2′)
and −NH2(2,2′) substituents. This approximately
8–9° deviation suggests some involvement of H-bonds. This
same angle is equal to roughly 30° for most of the syn-C2 transition states, with the exception of the
−NO2 and −CN substituents, where it is closer
to planar. An intriguing correlation is observed between the nonplanarity
angle θ and the transition state energy. As illustrated in Figure 7, the energy rises
as nonplanarity is introduced into this aromatic system. There is
one outlier, in that the −Ph(2,2′) substituent falls
off this linear relationship (and excluded from the linear approximation
sample), which is attributed to the close proximity of the two phenyl
groups along the syn-C2 pathway, which
is in turn accompanied by additional repulsive interactions.

Conclusions
The racemization of BINOL and its variations with a 1,1′-binaphthyl
skeleton passes through a preferred anti-Ci transition state. Replacement of H at the 2,2′ positions
with any substituent, whether −OH as in BINOL or any other
group, raises the barriers to racemization up to about 40 kcal/mol,
leading to the optical stability of this series of molecules. This
barrier is insensitive to the electron-withdrawing power of the substituents
but depends to some extent on their bulkiness. Placing the substituents
in the 6,6′ positions, where there are less steric repulsions
between them, reduces the racemization barrier to only about 25 kcal/mol.
Removal of the peripheral rings of the naphthyl systems, leaving only
a biphenyl skeleton, reduces the barrier still further to 11 kcal/mol
or less. It would appear that 2,2′ substitution, especially
of large bulky groups, offers the optimal means of improvements in
optical stability of the 1,1′-binaphthyl system.
