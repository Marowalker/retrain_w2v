Herein, we report the preparation
of graphene oxide dots (GO dots)
by fine-tuning the carbonization degree of citric acid. The structure
of GO dots was characterized by absorption spectroscopy, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, as well as high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
analyses. The typical particle size of the GO dots was 42 nm. The
fluorescent characteristics of the GO dots were analyzed by fluorescence
spectroscopy. Once excited at 360 nm, the GO dots were fluorescent
in the range of 450–550 nm, which was dependent on the excitation
wavelength. Further, GO dots were effectively utilized for multifarious
applications such as photoinduced electron transfer and detection
of explosives and biomolecules. The emission property of GO dots was
competently quenched by viologens, picric acid (PA), and bilirubin
(BR). The mechanism of quenching by viologens and explosives/biomolecules
was found to be due to photoinduced electron transfer and the internal
filter effect, respectively. Intriguingly, the detection minimum of
PA is in the nanomolar level. Toward commercialization, the economic
test strips have also been introduced for the identification of PA.
Furthermore, the GO dots have been applied as an efficient luminescent
bioprobe for a selective and perceptive finding of BR.

Introduction
Starting from tooth
paste to satellite and water purification to
medicine, the use of nanomaterials has dramatically increased in recent
years. Hence, it is necessary to have a basic knowledge of nanotechnology
at all levels.1 By a text book explanation,
nanomaterials are in the size range of 1–100 nm at least in
one dimension and small in size, which results in distinctive chemical
and physical properties.2 Recently, two
emerging carbon-based nanomaterials,3−6 such as graphene oxide (GO)7 and graphene
quantum dots (GQDs),8 were introduced into
the carbon-based nanomaterial family, which are fascinating to many
researchers. GO is an atomically thin sheet of graphite covalently
bonded with oxygen-containing functional groups, either on the basal
plane or at the edges.9 GQDs are a few
graphene layers connected together in a quasispherical shape in the
size of 1–10 nm,10 which exhibit
exclusive characteristics owing to their quantum confinement effects.
It is previously reported that GQDs show an excellent fluorescent
nature when compared to GO; however, later it was described that GQDs
and GO have the similar luminescence properties,8 which are highly utilized in several emerging fields, such
as solar devices,11 biocellular imaging,12 and drug release.13 GQDs and GO were generally prepared via both top-down (carving graphite
crystallites via high-resolution electron beam lithography,14 cutting of GO hydrothermally,15,16 repeated oxidation,17 electrochemical
methods,18 chemical oxidation treatment
of carbon precursors,19,20 and cage opening of the C60 on a ruthenium exterior21) and
bottom-up methods. However, the former one has some limitations, such
as special types of equipment being required, less product yield,
complex synthetic conditions, and poor control of the size. At the
same time, the bottom-up methods such as the hydrothermal method,
direct pyrolysis, and so forth are simple and economic for the preparation
of graphene-based nanomaterials from special organic precursors.22 The bottom-up method has some specific benefits
such as defined control over the morphology and the particle size
allocation of the products derived.

In recent times, fluorescent
carbon nanomaterials prepared from
citric acid (CA) via the thermal pyrolysis route with a high fluorescence
quantum yield were reported.9,23 Behrmann and Hofmann
used CA precursors with ammonia and described the formation of a blue
emissive molecule, citrazinic acid, for the first time.24 Later, Sell and Easterfield prepared the same
by reacting CA and urea at 130 °C.25 In recent times, Yang’s group explored the generation of
a fluorescent citrazinic acid-derived compound by the hydrothermal
method from CA with the combination of ethylenediamine.26 Three different amine precursors were used to
produce carbon dots via hydrothermal treatment by Rogach et al.27 In recent times, blue luminescent GQDs and GO
were prepared from CA simply by tuning the carbonization degree under
similar reaction conditions.9 It is understood
that the multiple oxygen-based functional groups present in GQDs and
GO impart a negative charge on the surface, which interacts noncovalently
with certain materials. For example, the Purkayastha research group
offered the preparation of CA-based CDs and the use of surface-encapsulated
derivatives of α-cyclodextrin-functionalized carbon dots with
methyl viologen (MV2+) to study the prominent photoinduced
electron transfer (PET) by aggregated nanostructures.28

In another upcoming field of research, the perceptive and careful detection of explosives
that have been paid more attention is contemporary because of the
inferences in motherland safety, worldwide demining, and ecological
protection.29−31 2,4,6-Trinitrophenol (TNP), a chemical compound commercially
known as picric acid (PA), is a dynamic explosive compared to the
well-known trinitrotoluene.32 It has been
broadly utilized in the manufacture of lethal weapons, preparation
of rocket fuels, coloring agents, crackers, and light matches.33 In addition, a large amount of used PA is continuously
left over in the debris remains as a major environmental pollutant.34 Hence, in the current scenario, there is a high
demand for the invention of a novel and facile route for the selective
finding of PA. The fluorescence quenching method has diverse benefits, such as it can be easily
used, it is sensitive and economic, and it has quick response time,35−38 which makes it a facile method for the detection of explosives.
A range of fluorescent materials such as organic dyes and polymers,39 metal–organic frameworks,43 quantum dots,40 assembled
monolayers,41 and fluorescent carbon dots
were used as high-performance fluorescence sensors.42 Among them, there are limited reports available on graphene-based
fluorescent materials for quantitative identification of nitro explosives;
however, unfortunately, they are a step behind in selectivity.43−46

The fluorescence quenching method has also been used for the
detection
of various biomolecules. Bilirubin (BR, Scheme S3) is one such important biomolecule whose level in the blood
plasma acts as a marker for the detection of certain diseases; elevated
levels of BR in the human body create a situation called hyperbilirubinemia.
The limited range of BR in blood serum is 19.80 mg mL–1 in a newborn and 1.19 × 10–2 mg mL–1 in adults.47 Excess BR in the human body
may be due to the heme catabolism and is excreted via bile, a symptom
of jaundice. The high level of BR accumulation can be identified by
a yellow tint of the skin and sclera in connection with jaundice.48 Moreover, an excess level of BR may cause neurotoxicity
in newborns, which leads to abnormalities in neurodevelopment. Different
procedures are in practice to detect BR, such as diazo, peroxidase,
and separation-based methods. Along with these methods, fluorometric
analysis is an easy, quick procedure and simple to detect BR using
nanoclusters, quantum dots, and fluorescent carbon dots.49,50 However, the requirement of expensive precursors and heavy metal
toxicity of chalcogenide quantum dots hampers the usage of metal nanoclusters
and quantum dots, which provide a pathway to use luminescent carbon
dots for the efficient quantification of BR.

In this study,
we present GO dots, a mixture of GQDs and GO, synthesized
by fine-tuning the carbonization extent of a common organic precursor,
such as CA, via direct pyrolysis using a simple bottom-up approach.
The prepared GO dots were successfully used for PET studies with structurally
similar viologen derivatives (Scheme S1) such as ethyl viologen (EV), dimeric ethyl viologen (EDV) and trimeric
ethyl viologen (ETV).51 Moreover, the bright
fluorescent nature of the GO dots has been used as a chemical sensor
toward sensitive and selective finding of an explosive such as PA
at a nanomolar scale via luminescence quenching analysis. Further,
a biologically important molecule such as BR has also been detected
using GO dots as a fluorescent sensor.

Results and Discussion
Material
Characterization
It was reported earlier that
different structured carbon nanomaterials can be acquired just by
fine-tuning the degree of carbonization duration. For instance, GQDs
and GO sheets were derived from CA by altering the degree of carbonization
time by 1/2 and 2 h, respectively.9 In
this work, an effort has been made in view of checking the characteristics
of carbon nanomaterials in the case of the carbonization time fixed
to 1 h. Therefore, we have done the pyrolysis of CA for a period of
1 h. Further, it is necessary to confirm the structure of the carbon
nanomaterial synthesized under this experimental condition, whether
the prepared material is GQDs or GO sheets. The one processed in this
study is readily soluble in H2O, brownish in color, and
exhibited high storage stability of more than 3 months without agglomeration.
The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis is done to find out
the surface functional groups and reactive sites of the carbon nanomaterial
(Figure S1a), which exhibited the O–H
and N–H stretching vibration of the carboxylic acid and amine
groups at 3327 cm–1 as a wide peak. The carbonyl
stretching frequency was found at 1729 cm–1, confirming
the existence of the carboxylic group. At 1544 and 1382 cm–1, the peaks were assigned to the carbonyl stretching and the asymmetric
stretching of the C–O–C band, respectively. In the spectrum
of CA, the C–H stretching is observed in the range of 1350
cm–1, and the absence of this peak in the prepared
nanomaterial and the decrease in the percentage of transmittance are
indicative of the fact that CA has been carbonized. The appearance
of negatively charged hydroxyl and carboxy functional groups on the
carbon surface was confirmed by zeta potential analysis, which explored
the value of −15.3 mV (Figure S2). The combined results from both the FT-IR and zeta potential data
validate the presence of various reactive sites on the surface of
the prepared nanomaterial, and possibly they impart hydrophilicity.
The functional groups were further analyzed by the NMR analysis. From
the 1H NMR data (Figure S3),
signals were observed in three regions, such as sp3 C–H
protons at 1–2 ppm; ether, carbonyl, and hydroxyl protons at
3–5 ppm; and aromatic sp2 and aldehydic protons
at 7–8.5 ppm. The existence of aliphatic, aromatic, and carbonyl
carbons was further confirmed by the 13C NMR analysis,
which shows a signal from 30 to 45 ppm corresponding to aliphatic
(sp3) carbons, 100–180 ppm corresponding to aromatic
or sp2 carbon, and 212 ppm corresponding to carbonyl carbon,
respectively. The discussed NMR results clearly demonstrate the ranges
of functional groups present on the prepared carbon nanomaterial surface.

Figures S1b and S4 show the high-resolution
scanning electron microscopy (HR-SEM) images of the prepared carbon
nanomaterial, which clearly indicate the existence of a layered structure
and quasispherical particles. The energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDAX) analysis (Figure S5) indicates the
presence of 41.31% carbon and 28.83% oxygen. This clearly proves that
the prepared nanomaterial is oxygenous carbon and that the existence
of other elements such as Na and Cl in the range of 25.88 and 3.98%,
respectively, is due to the addition of NaOH and HCl during the separation
and purification processes (neutralization). The high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image reveals that the nanomaterial consists
of sheets and most of the particles are quasispherical in shape (Figure 1a) with the typical
particle size in the range of 42 nm derived from the histogram plot
(Figure 1b). The selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern (Figure 1c) in which the spherical and bright spots
are exposed indicated the existence of both amorphous and crystalline
particles. Raman spectroscopy measurement is an essential tool especially
for the characterization of nanocarbon, which is used to prove the
surface structure, crystallinity, disorder/defects, stability, dispersibility,
and so forth. The Raman spectrum (Figure S6) revealed a broad D-band and a G-band at 1371 and 1610 cm–1, respectively. It is known that the sp3-hybridized orbital
of a carbon atom is represented by the D band and the sp2 carbon atom by the G band. Further, the D band looks wider than
the G band. Moreover, the intensity of the G band is higher than that
of the D band. The calculated ratio of relative intensity of ID/IG is around 0.30, which clearly illustrates
that a good quality carbon material is prepared and that the atoms
are arranged in a regular fashion. This result is in good agreement
with the reported Raman spectrum for GQDs; at the same time, it is
also noticed that there is a shift of 30 cm–1 in
the position of the G band that is endorsed to the oxygenation of
some percentage of carbon, which is in line with GO.52 Therefore, from the above characterizations, we consider
that the prepared carbon material exhibits the mixed behavior of both
GQDs and GO. Hence, we assigned the prepared nanomaterial as GO dots.
The combined behaviors of GO dots were further confirmed by optical
characterizations.

from HR-TEM
image details, and (c) SAED patterns of GO dots.

Optical Characterization
The UV–vis absorption
spectrum of GO dots (Figure 2a) shows a broad shoulder in the range of 250–500 nm
arising from the π–π* (raised from the aromatic
sp2 graphitic carbon) and n−π* transitions
(raised from the carbonyl group), which are similar to GO. It exhibits
a strong fluorescence emission at 464 nm at the excitation of 360
nm. Further, the emission spectra were verified at the different excitation
range from 280 to 480 nm in an interval of 20 nm (Figure 2b), which explored the excitation-dependent
wavelength emission. The different energy levels created by the various
emissive sites and fewer defects on the surface of GO dots may be
the reason behind the excitation-dependent emission nature.53Figure 2c shows that the fluorescence decay of the GO dots is fitted
with the triexponential function [F(t) = A1 exp(−t/τ1) + A2 exp(−t/τ2) + A3 exp(−t/τ3)], and the lifetimes of τ1 = 0.59 ns (19%), τ2 = 2.57 ns (66%), and
τ3 = 7.44 ns (15%) were obtained. The average lifetime
is calculated as τ = 2.89 ns. The several lifetimes imply the
existence of a mixture of emissive states on the surface of the GO
dots. The above discussions are not enough to confirm the structure
of GO dots as both GQDs and GO may exist together and both of them
show a similar behavior. In order to get a clear picture of the structure
of GO dots, we have adopted the spectral analysis in the presence
of a strong reducing agent such as NaBH4. As described
in the literature,9 the optical characteristics
of GQDs are not affected by NaBH4, but the properties such
as absorption wavelength, absorbance, and emission intensity of GO
could be altered by NaBH4. Therefore, we have analyzed
the consequence of NaBH4 addition on the absorption and
emission spectrum of GO dots, which is shown in Figure S7a,b. The results specified that the addition of a
reducing agent leads to a reduction in the optical density and an
increase in the emission intensity. These changes are due to the addition
of NaBH4, which has the capability to remove some of the
oxygen atoms from the sp3 C–O environment (including
C–OH, C–O–C, and COOH) to form an sp2 domain. The formed sp2 domain consists of new repeating
units, similar size allocation, and surface states, which leads to
an increase in the emission intensity. These results demonstrate that
the prepared GO dots have a GO structure. From these results, we conclude
that the prepared GO dots contain the properties of both GQDs and
GO, which will improve the effective utilization of the material for
a wide range of applications.

emission spectrum, and (c) fluorescence decay of GO dots (λexi: 370 nm).

PET Studies of GO Dots
Both functionalized and nonfunctionalized
carbon dots have been utilized for electron-transfer studies and other
applications.54,55 Here, we have utilized the luminescent
properties of GO dots for the photoinduced electron-transfer analysis
in view of using the GO dots in the energy field. GO dots have been
used as an electron donor in the excited state, and three structurally
related viologen derivatives such as EV, EDV, and ETV with varying
positive charges were used as electron acceptors.56,57 The UV–vis absorption analysis was conducted to study the
presence of a ground-state interaction between the GO dots and the
viologen derivatives. It is observed that the absorption band of the
GO dots has not altered in the presence of ETV (Figure S8). The presence of other two viologens also resulted
in a similar spectral behavior, which clearly points out that there
is no significant ground-state interaction between the GO dots and
viologen derivatives.

The excited-state interaction between
the GO dots and viologen derivatives has also been examined via fluorescence
analysis. The GO dots in solution exhibited a strong emission at 464
nm during the excitation at 360 nm. Here, the acceptor molecules (viologen)
do not absorb at 360 nm, so one can selectively excite the GO dots.
The emission spectrum of the GO dots was recorded in the absence and
presence of ETV and is displayed in Figure 3. The emission intensity of the GO dots was
regularly diminished with an increase in the concentration of ETV,
revealing the quenching. A similar type of quenching behavior was
observed for other viologen derivatives such as EV and EDV, and the
spectra are displayed in Figure S9a,b.
The extent of luminescent quenching is described by the Stern–Volmer
(S–V) eq 1 1  where I0 and I are the fluorescence intensities
of the GO dots in the
absence and presence of viologens, respectively. KSV is the S–V constant and [Q]
is the concentration of the respective quencher. The plot between I0/I and [Q] for all three viologens resulted in a linear straight line (Figure S10). From this linear plot, the quenching
constants and rate constants were calculated and are listed in Table 1. The calculated kq values are close to the diffusion-controlled
rate constant limit,58 which is 1010 M–1 s–1. Therefore,
it is indicated that dynamic quenching plays the most important role
in the quenching of GO dots by viologens. On the other hand, the quenching
efficiency of ETV is much higher compared to that of EDV and EV because
of the increased viologen units, which are known to enhance the PET.
If the quenching is purely due to electron transfer, the photoproducts
(cation and anion radicals) must be detected by the transient absorption
(TA) technique. Moreover, it is known that the TA signal of the cation
radical of viologen can be detected at 600 nm.59 Hence, we have employed the nanosecond TA spectroscopic
technique to probe the cation radical of viologen. Figure 4 shows the TA spectra of GO
dots with EV at various time delays. The samples were excited at 355
nm. From this figure, it is clear that GO dots alone do not show any
transient prominent signals. However, in the presence of EV, the transient
signal was observed at 610 nm. We assigned this signal as the cation
radical of EV, which is due to the PET reactions between the GO dots
and the EV. Hence, we unanimously believed that the observed quenching
is due to electron transfer.

Detection of Explosives
The finding of explosives is
another interesting and significant area of research.60−65 Herein, we have used the fluorescent nature of GO dots for sensing
the nitro aromatic chemicals,66 such as
TNP or PA, o-nitrophenol, p-nitrophenol,
2,4-dinitrophenol, nitrobenzene, dinitrobenzene, 2,4-dinitrophenyl
hydrazine, and phenol. The fluorescence titration method was performed
to analyze the quenching efficiency of nitro compounds. Interestingly,
PA showed 80% of quenching efficiency compared with other nitro compounds.
These observations reveal that the GO dots are much more perceptive
to PA than to the other nitro compounds (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Comparison of fluorescence quenching efficiency
of different nitro
aromatics (10 μM) on GO dots (λexi: 360 nm
and λemi: 464 nm) in a water medium.

Further, to determine the limit of detection by
GO dots for the
identification of PA, the fluorescence spectra were recorded at different
concentrations of PA from 1 to 10 μM (Figure 6a). The quenching of GO dots by PA is quantitatively
analyzed by using the S–V equation, I0/I = 1 + KSV [Q]. The S–V plot (Figure S11a) shows a linear curve at lower concentrations and a downward bending
curve for higher concentrations (0–10 μM) of PA. A similar
type of plot has been reported in the literature.67,68 The S–V constant is calculated directly from the slope by
using a linear fitted S–V plot. The nonlinear S–V plots
possibly due to both the self-absorption and the energy transfer mechanism69,70 and the S–V constant for the nonlinear plot were calculated
by using an exponential equation 2  where a, b, and k are constants. The S–V plot is fitted
perfectly with I0/I =
3.38 exp(0.0053[Q]) – 3.43, and the value
of the correlation coefficient (R2) is
0.9968, as displayed in Figure S11b. By
using the product constants a and k, the S–V constant value for PA was calculated as 1.79 ×
104 M–1, and the limit of detection of
92 nM is determined by using 3σ/k, in which
σ is the standard deviation and k is the slope.
The detection limit comparison of GO dots and other photoluminescent
sensors is compiled in Table S1. The lower
detection limit explored the practicability of GO dots for the selective
detection of PA.71−79 The selective quenching
of GO dots by PA is due to the inner filter effect as there is an
overlap between the absorption spectra of both GO dots and PA (Figure S12). The test strip-based detection of
PA using a thin-layer chromatography plate in view of demonstrating
the practical use of GO dots as a chemosensor is also observed. Figure 6b shows the test
strip with a drop of GO dots, which is highly emissive in nature under
longer ultraviolet light (top); after adding PA, the emission was
completely diminished (bottom). The test strip results for the GO
dots in the presence of other nitro compounds have also been displayed
in Figure S13, which inferred the selective
reduction of GO dot emission by PA compared to others. These remarks
made it clear that the TLC-based test strip can be successfully used
for the visual detection of PA in real samples.

of PA (0–10 μM) and (b) GO dot-based test strip, top:
drop of GO dots (5 mg/5 mL) and bottom: GO dots with PA (10 μM).

Detection of Biomolecules
Detection of biomolecules
is a fascinating area among the emerging research fields. Various
biomolecules with different structures including glucose, sucrose,
tryptophan, glycine, glutathione, alanine, BR, and urea were chosen
as a typical target material. Fluorescence analysis of GO dots in
the presence of the above-mentioned biomolecules was performed individually
to find out the quenching efficiency of different biomolecules to
GO dot emission. Among them, BR showed 50% quenching efficiency. This
observation clearly revealed that the GO dots are more sensitive to
BR than the other biomolecules (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Comparison of fluorescence quenching efficiency of different
biomolecules
(10 μM) on GO dots (λexi: 360 nm and λemi: 464 nm) in a phosphate buffer medium.

Consequently, in order to find out the detection limit, the
fluorescence
quenching measurement was carried out with different concentrations
of BR as projected in Figure S14a, which
clearly indicates the linear quenching of GO dots by BR in the concentration
range of 0–10 μM. The linear dynamic type of quenching
was determined by the S–V plot as shown in Figure S14b, and the inner filter effect is suggested for
the mechanism of quenching, which was due to the absorption spectral
overlap between the GO dots and BR (Figure S15). Further, the limit of detection of BR was calculated to be 0.52
μg/mL, according to a signal-to-noise ratio of S/N = 3. Moreover,
the value of limit of detection was much lesser than the limit of
BR in blood plasma (19.80 mg/mL in a newborn and 1.19 × 10–2 mg/mL in adults).47 The
detection limit comparison for BR by other photoluminescent sensors
is compiled in Table S2. Hence, these experimental
results clearly illustrate that the GO dots could be applied as an
efficient fluorescent bioprobe for the selective and sensitive detection
of BR.

Conclusions
In summary, a successful
synthesis of GO dots by fine-tuning the
carbonization extent of CA via a facile as well as a single-step pyrolysis
method is reported. The prepared GO dots exhibited the mixed properties
of GQDs as well as GO, and it was thoroughly characterized by pivotal
techniques. PET studies of GO dots with viologens explored the effective
utilization of GO dots in the energy field as a shuttling mediator.
The excellent luminescent properties of GO dots were used for choosy
and quantitative detection of PA in a nanomolar range and have also
been demonstrated via the test strip method. Furthermore, GO dots
have been used as a biosensor for the selective detection of BR at
the microgram level. Overall, the mixed behavior of GQDs and GO renders
GO dots an effective usage in diverse applications such as in the
environmental-related fields.

Materials and Methods
Materials
CA was
procured from Fisher Scientific. Other
reagents were of analytical grade and bought from LOBA Chemicals (India).
Nitro compounds and biomolecules were purchased from Merck. Milli-Q
water was used as a medium in spectral analysis.

Characterization
Techniques
HR-SEM measurement was
done for the dried GO dot sample with the use of Nova NanoSEM 600
from FEI Company, Netherlands, and elemental analysis was done using
an EDAX system. The average size of the particles was probed by HRTEM
(JEOL JEM-2100) with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The specimen
for the TEM analysis was prepared by drop-coating a GQD solution on
the carbon-coated copper grid, which was further completely dried
by slow evaporation of the solvent. The hydrodynamic size of the particles
in medium, dispersibility, and surface charge were observed by the
dynamic light scattering method by using a Malvern DLS instrument.
FT-IR spectral analysis was done with the help of a JASCO FT-IR ATR
6300 spectrometer at ambient temperature in the spectral range of
4000–400 cm–1. Raman spectrum was recorded
using a high-resolution Renishaw Raman microscope using a He–Ne
laser of 18 mW at 633 nm. NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker instrument
operating at 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C, and the details were collected at ambient temperature and the
spectral data were calibrated to an internal tetramethylsilane standard.
UV–vis absorption spectral measurements were obtained using
a PerkinElmer Lamda 25 spectrophotometer. The emission nature and
steady-state fluorescence quenching analysis were done using a PerkinElmer
LS 45 spectrofluorometer. The slit width for both excitation and emission
was fixed as 5 nm, and the rate of scanning was fixed as 200 nm min–1. Excited-state decays were measured in a time-correlated
single-photon counting system using a fluorocube fluorescence lifetime
spectrometer (JOBIN-VYON), and the sample was initially excited at
370 nm. Data analysis was carried out by the software provided by
IBH (DAS-6), based on the deconvolution procedure using a nonlinear
least-squares technique, and the excellence of the fit was determined
with the value of χ2 < 1.2.

Synthetic Procedure
The GO dots were derived from CA
via direct pyrolysis, a facile, low-cost, and bottom-up method based
on the reported protocol9 with some modifications.
The typical procedure followed is as follows: 5 g of the precursor
was taken in a dried beaker and heated at 200 °C. It is noteworthy
to mention that when the heating was initiated, exactly at the melting
point of CA, we obtained a colorless solution, which changed to an
orange solution beyond its melting point. Further, continued heating
for 1 h resulted in the conversion of the orange solution to a dark
brownish colloid, indicating the formation of a carbon-based material.
Further, 1 M NaOH was added dropwise into the solution under continuous
stirring. Subsequently, the resulted solution was neutralized by dropwise
addition of dilute HCl, which turned the solution color into orange.
Finally, the reaction products were centrifuged for 30 min at 3000
rpm in order to eliminate the black insoluble carbonaceous materials,
and the transparent orange supernatant was separated out. Further,
the orange solution was passed through a disposable cellulose membrane
filter with a pore size of 0.2 μm followed by extensive dialysis
done against Millipore water using a dialysis tube (15 000
molecular weight cutoff) for 48 h to remove the small fluorescent
molecules (dialysis water was changed at 8 h intervals). After dialysis,
the clear orange solution containing fluorescent carbon dots was concentrated
by distillation under reduced pressure and dried out in a vacuum oven.
The obtained solid product exhibited high photostability (Figure S16a), and it is water-dispersible in
nature. The storage stability of the GO dots has also been ensured
by storing the solution at 4 °C, which is stable for more than
3 months (Figures S16b and S17). A product
yield of 65% is obtained from the above procedure. The images of CA
and synthesized GO dots are shown in Scheme S2. It is observed that the precursor (CA) is a colorless and crystalline
solid compound, and after pyrolysis, it turned to a brown-colored
crystalline solid product. The proposed mechanism for the formation
of GO dots from CA is the carbonization of CA during pyrolysis to
some extent, which leads to the generation of graphite structures
via removal of water molecules as well as hydrogen bonding between
the carbonyl and OH groups. The extended carbonization of CA leads
to the formation of both GO sheets and GQDs, which are together called
as GO dots (Scheme S4).
