Class I α-mannosidases (MNSs)
play important roles in protein
N-glycosylation. However, no data are currently available about MNSs
in cassava (Manihot esculenta), of
which the functions are therefore not known, particularly in relevance
to postharvest physiological deterioration (PPD). A total of seven
genes were identified from the cassava genome in the present study.
Two (MeMNS2 and MeMNS6) of the seven
genes may be pseudogenes, as indicated by sequence alignment and exon–intron
organizations. Five MNSs could be classified into three subfamilies.
Tissue-specific expression analysis revealed that MNS genes have distinct expression patterns in different tissues between
sugar cassava and cultivated cassava varieties, indicating their functional
diversity. A PPD response and defense model was proposed based on
the transcription data of MNSs and genes involved
in reactive oxygen species, signal transduction, and cell wall remodeling.
The findings help in the understanding of PPD responses in cassava.

==== Body
Introduction
N-glycosylation is
a major posttranslational modification of proteins
in all eukaryotic cells. It affects many important biological processes
such as protein folding,1−3 enzyme activity,4,5 intracellular trafficking,6,7 and cell–cell
communications.8

Class I α-mannosidases
(MNSs; glycosyl hydrolase family 47)
are involved in early N-glycan-processing reactions and in N-glycan-dependent
quality control in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).9 Structural Ca2+ is required for catalysis, and
MNSs are sensitive to the inhibitor kifunensine.10 The mammalian and Arabidopsis class I
α-mannosidase family consists of three protein subgroups: ER
α 1,2-mannosidases I (ER-MNSIs), Golgi-α-mannosidases
I (Golgi-MNSIs), and ER degradation-enhancing α-mannosidase
(EDEM)-like proteins.9 These characteristics
and classifications have been highly conserved throughout eukaryotic
evolution. Five MNS proteins were characterized in Arabidopsis. MNS1, MNS2, and MNS3 played a role in root development and cell
wall biosynthesis,9 while MNS4 and MNS5
were required for endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation of
misfolded glycoproteins.11

Cassava
is a major food crop in the tropics and subtropics as well
as a potential biofuel crop due to its high starch production.12 Roots are the main storage organs in cassava.
Cassava has a fibrous root system consisting of the adventitious roots
that arise from the base of the stem cuttings and their attendant
lateral roots that successively develop.13 The rapid development of both adventitious and lateral roots may
last 8 or 10 weeks after planting and can reach a maximum weight in
60 days after planting.14 Only a few fibrous
roots become tuberous and most of the others continue their function
of nutrient absorption.15 The tuberous
root is the organ that is harvested. However, rapid postharvest physiological
deterioration (PPD), a unique phenomenon in harvesting storage roots,
has become a major constraint for extending cassava shelf life in
comparison with the roots of the other crops.16 PPD is a complex physiological and biochemical process, which involves
many regulatory networks linked with specific proteins and signaling
pathways.17 PPD, which occurs 24–48
h after harvest, is initiated by an oxidative burst,18 followed by the accumulation of secondary metabolites.19,20 Recent data suggested the crosstalk between reactive oxygen species
(ROS), calcium signal transduction, and programmed cell death (PCD)
during PPD in cassava.21 The most important
limiting factors for studying PPD were the lack of PPD-tolerant varieties
and the absence of accurate regulating factors known to alleviate
cassava PPD.16 Functional studies are therefore
needed to better understand the PPD response and provide a worthwhile
approach to control it.

Due to the importance of MNSs in stress tolerance22 and root development
of Arabidopsis, we were interested in exploring its
functions in relevance to cassava
roots and PPD. It is reported that the suppression of the N-glycan-processing
enzyme α-mannosidase can enhance the shelf life of fruits.23 Therefore, the identification and expression
analysis of MNSs were conducted in the present study. The putative
relationship between PPD and MeMNSs was also explored. The results
will be helpful for further understanding of the possible roles of
MNSs and build a foundation for future studies on cassava PPD.

Results
Identification
and Phylogenetic Analysis of MNSs in Cassava
The amino acid
sequences of five Arabidopsis thaliana MNSs (AtMNS1 to AtMNS5) were used to search the cassava genome for
candidate MNS proteins. Seven cassava (Manihot esculenta) enzymes with significant amino acid sequence similarity to AtMNSs
were identified and named as MeMNS1-6, including MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2.
Five cassava MNS enzymes contain a conserved α-1,2-mannosidase
sequence domain (PfamPF01532) and are members of glycosyl hydrolase
47 family (carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) database). However, MeMNS2
and MeMNS6 contained only a partial glycosyl hydrolase 47 domain.

To determine the evolutionary relationship among the MNS enzymes,
sequences of 20 MNS family members from M. esculenta, A. thaliana, Brachypodium
distachyon, and Oryza sativa were analyzed using neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree analysis.
These MNS enzymes were classified into three subgroups (Figure 1). MeMNS1 was classified as
Golgi-MNSI. MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2 were classified as ER-MNSIs. MeMNS4
and MeMNS5 were classified as EDEMs. However, MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 were
far away from AtMNS1 and AtMNS2 (Supporting Information Figure S1). In the ER-MNSI group, MeMNS3-1 and
MeMNS3-2 showed a close relationship, with 89.0% amino acid identity,
making them likely functionally redundant proteins. MeMNS4 shared
with 49.0% amino acid similarity with MeMNS5.

the MNSs from M. esculenta. Blue circles
show the three subgroups of MNSs.

Characterization of MeMNS Genes and Enzymes
Most of the full-length coding sequences of the MeMNS genes ranged from 1725 bp (MeMNS1) to 1890 bp (MeMNS3), whereas MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 were 969 bp and 687 bp, respectively. The size of most deduced MeMNS
enzymes varied between 502 amino acids (aa) and 629 aa, except MeMNS2
(322 aa) and MeMNS6 (228 aa). The molecular weights (MW) of most MeMNS
enzymes varied from 56.95 to 70.52 kDa, and the theoretical isoelectric
points (pI) of the proteins encoded by these genes ranged from 5.21
to 7.00 (Table 1).
All seven MeMNS sequences were aligned with AtMNS1, which showed that
MeMNSs contain multiple conserved residues and relatively variable
N-terminal and C-terminal domains (Supporting Information Figure S1). Interestingly, MeMNS2 contains the
first half of the MeMNS1, while MeMNS6 contains the second half; consequently,
both MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 would not be a functional MNSI.

MeMNS6	Manes.06G018400	OAY46677	687	228	5.56	26.28	
The five MeMNSs were
aligned with all AtMNSs (Supporting Information Figure S2). The structure of each MNS is shown
in Figure 2 according
to the subgroup. The similarity to AtMNS, except MeMNS2 and MeMNS6,
suggested that all of the enzymes have four active site residues and
one Ca2+ binding residue. Those active site residues are
conserved. Taking MeMNS1 as an example, four active site residue numbers
are 187, 319, 430, and 452, and one Ca2+ binding residue
number is 536. However, MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 have only a partial GH47
domain. MeMNS2 has two active site residues, whereas MeMNS6 has two
active site residues and one Ca2+ binding residue.

the transmembrane domain, silver box solid shows the GH47 domain.
The number means four active site residues (from left) and Ca2+ binding residue (the last).

Structure Analysis and Chromosomal Distribution of MeMNS Genes
To gain further insight into the evolutionary relationships
of MeMNSs, the exon–intron structure for each
member was analyzed. The number of exons in MeMNS genes ranged from 5 to 17 (Figure 3A). MeMNS1 had 14 exons. Among the
ER-MNSI group, MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2 had six exons, and the exon–intron structures were similar. MeMNS4 and MeMNS5 had 17 and 15 exons,
respectively. MeMNS2 had eight exons, while MeMNS6 had only five exons.

of the seven MeMNS genes. Introns and exons are shown
in blue lines and
green boxes, respectively. (B) Chromosome localization of MeMNS genes. The position of the MeMNS genes
is shown in red lines with the orientation indicated in blue arrows.

The chromosomal distribution and
orientation of MeMNS genes were also identified.
The results showed that the seven genes
can be mapped to four chromosomes (Figure 3B). No tandem duplication of the cassava MeMNS genes was found. MeMNS1, MeMNS3-1, MeMNS3-2, and MeMNS5 had the same orientation and are present on chromosomes 3, 15,
17, and 6, respectively. MeMNS4 was found to be present
on chromosome 3, while MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 were mapped to chromosome 6, with the opposite orientation as MeMNS1.

Expression Analysis of MeMNSs in Different
Tissues and Root Developmental Stages
The cassava cultivars M. esculenta cv. SC no. 205 (SC205, with a high starch
content approximately at 28%) and M. esculenta cv. CAS36.12 (sugar cassava, a low starch content approximately
at 3%) were selected and assayed for the expression of MeMNSs in different tissues and at different root development stages. In
SC205, MeMNS1, MeMNS3-1, and MeMNS3-2 were highly expressed in leaves, stem, and tuberous
roots, respectively (Supporting Information Figure S3A). MeMNS4 and MeMNS5 were
highly expressed in leaves. However, in CAS36.12, MeMNS1 was highly expressed in petioles, and the other four genes were
highly expressed in tuberous roots (Supporting Information Figure S3B).

The expression level of MeMNSs was measured during root development 4, 6, 8, and
10 months after planting (Supporting Information Figure S3C,D). In SC205, The expression level of MeMNS1 was similar in months 4 and 6 but dropped by 90% in months 8 and
10. On the contrary, in Cas36.12, the level of MeMNS1 expression dropped only by 50% in months 6, 8, and 10, relative
to month 4. In SC205, MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2 expressions were considerably lower in month 8 and increased
again to 50 and 100% of month 4 for MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2, respectively. In CAS36.12, MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2 expressions were low in months
6 and 8 and the same in months 4 and 10, respectively. Interestingly,
the EDEMs MeMNS4 and MeMNS5 showed
the same expression pattern within each cultivar.

N-Glycoprotein
Detection and Transcriptome Analysis of MeMNSs and
Related Genes After Harvest
The cassava
cultivars M. esculenta cv. SC no. 14
(SC14) (with high PPD resistance) and M. esculenta cv. SC no. 9 (SC9) (PPD sensitivity) were selected and examined
for differences in glycoprotein expression and transcriptome analysis.
The original images of sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) and Western blot are shown in Figure 4A. The results showed that the number of
N-glycoproteins in SC9 tuberous roots at 48 h was fewer than that
in SC14.

To better understand the expression
patterns of MeMNS genes in response to PPD, RNAs
from tuberous roots in different
times were extracted for subsequent RNA-seq analysis. Transcripts
of five MeMNSs and other related genes were captured
in a transcriptional data search. The differential expressions of
these genes in SC14 and SC9 at 48 h were compared to those at 0 h.
The analyses revealed some upregulation of genes that are associated
with ROS, signal transduction, and cell wall remodeling in SC9 and
SC14 tuberous roots (Figure 4B). It showed upregulation of genes at 48 h that encode antioxidation
enzymes in SC14 tuberous roots, such as superoxide dismutase (SOD),
peroxidase (POD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX). Moreover, the
expressions at 0 and 48 h in SC9 varied notably larger than those
in SC14. Calmodulin (CaM) and 14-3-3 showed a similar pattern as SOD.
The expression of ethylene biosynthesis gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine synthase (SAMS) was downregulated at 48 h, whereas
the jasmonic acid biosynthesis gene encoding alleneoxidecyclase (AOC)
was upregulated.

The RNA-seq data also showed changes in genes
that encode certain
cell-wall-degrading enzymes, such as pectin methylesterase (PME) and
glucan endo-1,3-β-d-glucosidase (TomQb). Therefore,
PPD not only caused ROS formation but also affected pectin and cellulose
degradation. Moreover, most MeMNSs were downregulated
48 h after harvest, whereas MeMNS3-1 expression was
upregulated in SC14 but downregulated in SC9. MeMNS3-1 is suspected to be the main factor gene in PPD resistance process.
A PPD response and defense model presented in Figure 5 illustrates the regulation of ROS, signal
transduction, programmed cell death (PCD), N-glycosylation, and cell
wall remodeling in cassava PPD processes.

Discussion
MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 May Be Pseudogenes
The ORF
lengths of MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 are
969 bp and 687 bp, respectively, and the corresponding enzymes
have 322 aa and 228 aa. An apparent insertion of some nucleotides
makes it two different genes, which is supported by the structure
distribution (Figure 2) and the location in chromosome 6 (Figure 3B). Interestingly, MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 reside very close in the chromosome.
If MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 were linked together, it would closely resemble
MeMNS1. Although both of them had a partial sequence of GH47 family
and expressed in the transcript level, it may not produce a functional,
full-length protein. According to the definition of pseudogenes,24MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 may be pseudogenes in this family, while the final confirmation
of this assignment has to await the demonstration of the appropriate
enzymatic activity.

Potential Role of MeMNSs in PPD
The PPD phenomenon
is a global challenge for cassava breeders, farmers, and factories.
It can cause cassava root spoilage and reduce the shelf life during
storage.25 Wounding during harvest rapidly
leads to increased ROS in cassava tuberous roots. Inefficient endogenous
ROS scavenging thus results in excess ROS, which triggers rapid PPD
responses.26 Therefore, increasing the
production of ROS scavenges is a key regulator of PPD. The expression
of SOD and CAT,26 mitochondrial alternative
oxidase (AOX),12 glutathione reductases,27 and GPX28 during
PPD lead to timely scavenging of excess ROS, thereby maintaining the
ROS homeostasis balanced and delaying PPD occurrence (Figure 5).

Calcium (Ca2+) plays an important role in signal transduction and activates a
collection of target proteins leading to a physiological response.
Ca2+ is also necessary for the integrity of the cell wall
and the membrane systems.29 In previous
studies, Ca2+ was linked with regulating PPD onset. Following
root wounding, calcium changes preceded a burst in ROS.30 In the present study, MeMNS genes were downregulated at 48 h (Figure 4). This may cause more Ca2+ signatures
being recognized by several types of Ca2+-sensor proteins,
such as calmodulins (CaMs)31,32 (Figure 5). The Ca2+–CaM complex
may activate target proteins to resist PPD. Further elucidation of
roles of MNSs binding with Ca2+ specifically with PPD would
advance the understanding of the molecular machinery controlling PPD
onset.

The cell wall undergoes significant remodeling during
PPD.29 PME contributes to cell wall loosening
and degradation
by promoting the activity of cell wall hydrolases.33 In the present study, PME increased in SC14, the PPD-resistant
variety, from 0 to 48 h (Figure 4B), whereas PME in SC9 decreased. N-glycoproteins are
a constituent of the cell wall.34 The data
showed that suppressing N-glycan-processing enzymes can enhance the
fruit shelf life, such as α-mannosidase and β-d-N-acetylhexosaminidase, which are involved in degrading
cell wall N-glycoproteins.23 Transcriptomic
analysis showed that PPD affects MeMNS genes that
are responsible for protein N-glycosylation. The ER and Golgi-MNSs
genes were expressed higher in the PPD-tolerant variety SC14 than
those in the PPD-sensitive variety SC9. It appears that the modification
of N-glycan-processing ability would be a potential strategy to extend
the cassava root shelf life.

On the basis of the data described
above, we would propose a mechanism
of PPD response and defense in cassava (Figure 5). All impact factors associated with PPD
were used to generate the model. Mechanical damage caused by wounding
induces oxidative burst and stimulates a Ca2+ influx. This
flux is sensed by Ca2+-binding proteins such as CaM. Such
signaling was essential for regulating ROS homeostasis and cell wall
remodeling. Interestingly, ethylene and jasmonic acid pathways were
also induced by signal transduction during PPD. Moreover, cell wall
integrity needs more N-glycosylated proteins, which are processed
in the ER and Golgi. Cassava PPD is a complex process of crosstalk
among signaling, ROS, PCD, N-glycosylation, and cell wall remodeling.

Conclusions
A total of seven class I α-mannosidase
genes (MNSs) were identified from the cassava genome.
Two (MeMNS2 and MeMNS6) of the seven
genes may be pseudogenes.
Five MNS enzymes could be classified into the three enzyme subfamilies
Golgi-MNSI, ER-MNSIs, and EDEMs. MeMNS1 was classified as Golgi-MNSI;
MeMNS3-1 and MeMNS3-2 as ER-MNSIs; and MeMNS4 and MeMNS5 were classified
as EDEMs. However, MeMNS2 and MeMNS6 were far away from AtMNS1 and
AtMNS2. The MNS genes showed distinct expression
profiles in different tissues. A PPD response and defense model was
proposed on the basis of the transcription data of MNSs and genes involved in ROS formation, signal transduction, and cell
wall remodeling. Class I α-mannosidases are putatively relevant
to cassava postharvest physiological deterioration.

Materials and
Methods
Plant Materials
Cassava cultivars with high starch
content (∼28%) (M. esculenta cv. SC no. 205 (SC205)), low starch content germplasm (∼3%)
(sugar cassava, M. esculenta cv. CAS36.12),
high PPD resistance variety (M. esculenta cv. SC no. 14 (SC14)), and PPD-sensitive variety (M. esculenta cv. SC no. 9 (SC9)) were selected in
the present study. SC14, SC9, and SC205 were obtained from the Tropical
Crops Genetic Resources Institute (TCGRI) and the Chinese Academy
of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS), and CAS36.12 originated
from Brazil (Embrapa) and was currently being planted in the Cassava
Germplasm Bank (CGB), TCGRI, CATAS. For the analysis of gene differential
expression in tissues and organs, the plant materials from SC205 and
CAS36.12 were collected as follows. The leaves (L), petioles (P),
stems (S), tuberous roots (T), and fibrous roots (F) were collected
60 days after planting. For differential expression analysis of these
genes during tuber root development, the roots were collected at 120
(4 months), 180 (6 months), 240 (8 months), and 300 days (10 months)
after planting. Biological samples were collected in triplicate for
analyses. All materials were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen
and stored at −80 °C for RNA isolation.

Identification
of MNS Gene Family in Cassava
The sequences
of five A. thaliana MNS proteins were
downloaded from the TAIR10 database (http://www.arabidopsis.org). BLASTP searches were performed in the cassava genome database
(http://www.phytozome.net/cassava) with the Arabidopsis MNS proteins as queries.
First, all corresponding protein sequences of the putative MeMNS family
members that satisfied E < 10–10 were downloaded. All candidate proteins were then tested with the
Pfam database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam/search.shtml).35 The full-length cDNA sequences of MeMNS genes were downloaded from the cassava-sequencing
database.

Multiple Sequence Alignment and Phylogenetic Analysis of MNS
Proteins
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using
ClustalW with gap open and gap extension penalties of 10 and 0.1,
respectively.36 Amino acid sequences of
20 proteins from M. esculenta, A. thaliana, B. distachyon, and O. sativa were aligned using
ClustalX2.0,37 and the unrooted phylogenetic
tree was generated using MEGA 4.0 software, with the neighbor-joining
method and bootstrap values from 1000 replicates at each branch.38

Protein Properties and Sequence Analyses
The MW and
pI of presumed MeMNS proteins were predicted with the Prot Param online
tool.39 The protein structures were drawn
using the protein information on Uniprot.

Exon–Intron Structure
Analysis and Chromosomal Mapping
The exon–intron structure
of each MeMNS gene was determined by aligning the
cDNA sequence of MNS with the genomic sequence in
the cassava genome database. The gene
schematic structure was drawn by the gene structure display server.40 The genomic position of the MeMNS genes and the total length of each chromosome were obtained from
the cassava genome database. Subsequently, the MeMNS genes were manually mapped onto chromosomes.

Cloning of Five MeMNS Genes
MeMNS1, MeMNS3-1, MeMNS3-2, MeMNS4, and MeMNS5 were cloned
in the present study. The total RNA was extracted from cassava leaves
using RNA Plant plus Reagent (TianGen, Beijing, China). Full-length
cDNAs of the MeMNS genes were isolated by reverse
transcription PCR using gene-specific primers (Supporting Information Table S1). All PCR products were separately cloned
into the pEASY Blunt vector (TransGen) and were sequenced by Sangon
Biological Engineering Technology and Services (Shanghai, China).

Quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) Analyses
RNA samples
were extracted with an RNAprep Pure Plant plus Kit according to the
manufacturer’s protocol (Tiangen). The RNA quality was determined
by running an agarose gel with GelStain (TransGen) staining. The RNA
concentration was determined with NanoVue Plus ultramicro spectrophotometer
(GE Healthcare). Reverse transcription was performed according to
the manufacturer’s protocol (TransGen). The primers are listed
in Supporting Information Table S2. The
qRT-PCR reactions were performed in 10 μL volume in a Piko REAL
thermocycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Göteborg, Sweden).
The formula 2–ΔΔCt was used to calculate the relative fold change between the
treatment stages.41 The experiments were
performed in triplicate.

Western Blot Analyses
The roots
of the cassava genotypes
SC14 and SC9 were carefully harvested 10 months after planting. The
halved roots in uniform size were randomly stored at 26–28
°C and 70–80% relative humidity. After 0 and 48 h, the
total proteins were extracted from injured tuberous roots according
to An et al.42 Proteins were detected by
immunostaining with anti-HRP antibody (Gtxot-096-D) from ImmunoReagents,
Inc. (Raleigh, NC). Western blots were developed according to the
method of NBT/BCIP from Roche (11681451001). The signals on the nitrocellulose
were scanned immediately by Image Scanner III (GE healthcare), and
the data were quantified with ChemiImager 4400 software.

Transcriptome
Analysis
The total RNA from tuberous
roots was extracted at 0 and 48 h. RNA-seq technique was employed
to measure the global expression of cassava genes. Clean reads were
mapped to the cassava reference genome (version 6.1), derived from
the Phytozome12 website, using TopHat v.2.0.10 (http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/).43 The resulting alignment files were
provided as input for Cufflinks to generate transcriptome assemblies.44 DEGseq was applied to identify differentially
expressed genes with a random sampling model based on the read counts
for each gene.45
