The accuracy and reliability of 17
commonly used density functionals
in conjunction with Poisson–Boltzmann finite solvation model
were gauged for predicting the free energy of Rh(I)- and Rh(III)-mediated
chemical transformations such as ligand exchange, hydride elimination,
dihydrogen elimination, chloride affinity, and silyl hydride bond
activation reactions. In total, six Rh-mediated reactions were examined,
and the computed density functional theory results were then subjected
to comparison with the experimentally reported values. For reaction
A, involving replacement of N2 with η2-H2 over Rh(I), MPWB1K-D3, B3PW91, B3LYP, and BHandHYLP
emerged to be the best functionals of all the tested methods in terms
of their deviations ≤2 kcal mol–1 from experimental
data. For reaction B, in which exchange of η2-C2H4 with N2 over Rh(I) takes place, MPWB1K-D3
and M06-2X-D3 functionals performed the best, while as for reaction
C (hydride elimination reaction in Rh(III) complex), it is PBE functional
that showed impressive performance. Similarly, for reaction D (H2 elimination reaction in Rh(III) complex), PBE0-D3 and PBE-D3
showed exceptional results compared to other functionals. For reaction
E (H2O/Cl– exchange), the PBE0 again
shows impressive performance as compared to other functionals. For
reaction F (Si–H activation), M06-2X-D3, PBE0-D3, and MPWB1K-D3
functionals are undoubtedly the best functionals. Overall, PBE0-D3
and MPWB1K-D3 functionals were impressive in all cases with lowest
mean unsigned errors (3.2 and 3.4 kcal mol–1, respectively)
with respect to experimental Gibbs free energies. Thus, these two
functionals are recommended for studying Rh-mediated chemical transformations.

Introduction
Rhodium is used in
homogeneous catalysis for carrying a wide variety
of chemical transformations.1−11 Very often, these catalytic chemical processes involve transfer
hydrogenation from the metal hydride bond to unsaturated substrates,4,9,12−17 dehydrogenation of H2 from the metal center,18 or interaction of alkenes with the metal center
of the catalyst.19 Moreover, the interaction
of small molecules such as H2 and ethene with Rh complexes
is very significant in CO2 hydrogenation and C–C
coupling reactions, respectively.7,9,20 In order to understand these transition-metal-mediated
catalytic processes, density functional theory (DFT) has been extensively
used over the last 20 years,21−29 and it has revolutionized this field not only by predicting the
reaction mechanism but also by paving a way for catalyst designing
as well.30−33 However, the evidence of accuracy of DFT methods remains less because
of limited benchmarking studies for every elementary step of a transition-metal-mediated
chemical reaction.34 Thus, prior to applying
DFT model to any catalytic process, its accuracy should be evaluated.
Therefore, understanding the accuracy of commonly used DFT methods
for predicting thermochemistry involving interactions with such small
molecules will immensely help in better understanding of these catalytic
processes.

Several benchmarking DFT studies of transition-metal-mediated
chemical
transformations have been proposed, which provide in-depth insights,22,35−44 but in the case of Rh complexes, only small benchmarking studies
are available in the literature. Of these, Hu and Boyd examined the
free energy of CO dissociation from the Rh(CO)2(Cl2)− complex using the B3LYP density functional
and was found to be within the 1–2 kcal mol–1 accuracy limit when compared with CCSD(T) results.45 Wilson and Laury studied the performance of various density
functionals for predicting gas-phase enthalpies for formation of small
4d transition-metal complexes.46 The results
were compared with relativistic pseudopotential correlation-consistent
composite approach (rp-ccCA), and of the various DFT functionals used,
the double-hybrid functionals, B2GP-PLYP and mPW2-PLYP, were found
to be accurate with mean absolute deviations of 4.25 and 5.19 kcal
mol–1, respectively, from the experimental values.
Moreover, Chen et al. studied the H–H and C–H σ-bond
activation coordinated with the Ru and Rh metals.47 The good functionals for both Ru and Rh for predicting
activation energies were reported to be MN12SX < CAM-B3LYP <
M06-L < MN12L < M06 < ωB97X < B3LYP < LC-ωPBE
based on their increasing mean unsigned deviations of less than 2
kcal/mol. However, for computing reaction energies, the PBE0 functional
was proposed to be the best functional. Furthermore, Gusev also examined
the accuracy of M06-L functional for predicting thermochemistry of
ligand dissociation, ligand replacement, and cleavage in 4d and 5d
metal complexes.48 They concluded that
the difference between the theory and experiment is ≤1 kcal
mol–1 in several cases.

Despite all these
studies, the detailed benchmarking studies assessing
the accuracy of various density functionals for Rh-mediated catalytic
reactions are limited, particularly those in which different reactions
of a same metal complex are considered. Moreover, there may not be
a single answer to every Rh-mediated transformation, and for every
reaction, there must be a best functional which must be searched through
benchmarking studies. Owing to the importance of Rh in homogeneous
catalysis, we examined the accuracy of commonly used DFT methods for
predicting free energy of binding small molecules such as η2-H2 and η2-C2H4, hydride elimination, H2 elimination, chloride
affinity, and Si–H activation of Rh-mediated reactions as shown
in Scheme 1. Both dispersion-corrected
and dispersion-uncorrected functionals were employed comprising a
total of 17 functionals, namely, B3LYP, B3LYP-D3, BHandHYLP, PBE,
PBE-D3, PBE0-D3, PBE0, M06, M06-D3, M06-L, M06-2X-D3, MPW1K, MPWB1K-D3,
B3PW91, B3PW91-D3, B97-D, and B97-D3. In order to assess the accuracy
of these DFT methods for the above said reactions, we compared our
computed results with their experimental values as reported in the
literature.49−52 The free-energy values for reactions A, B, C, and D are −0.71
± 0.03, +1.08 ± 0.01, +50.4, and +0.44 kcal mol–1, respectively.49,50 The values of standard-state
reaction Gibbs free energy for reactions E and F were computed form
the experimentally reported equilibrium constant values using the
equation ΔG = −RT ln K.51,52 The free energy of reactions
A and B were also computed by Milstein and co-workers, but instead
of using the Rh[tBu2PCH2(C6H3)CH2PtBu2] pincer catalyst, they used the Rh[tBu2P(CH2)2(CH)(CH2)2PtBu2]
complex for their studies.53 They reported
the value of free energy for reactions A and B at the same temperature
and pressure equal to −1.24 ± 0.04 and +1.57 ± 0.01,
respectively, which is almost similar to the values reported by Fujita
and co-workers.49 Thus, these values of
experimental free energies are reliable at the reported conditions
of temperature and pressure. The values of reactions C and D have
been computed at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C. Similarly,
for computing the equilibrium constant of reaction E[log K(H2O/Cl–) values],
Enyedy et al. tested the number of Rh complexes by replacing various
ligands around the metal center and obtained results within the range
1.5–3.0.51 For reaction F, Sadow
et al. determined the equilibrium constant at 297 K from four independent
measurements with the value equal to 2.8 ± 0.3.52 They also reported the standard-state enthalpy and entropy
of the reaction with their values equal to −5.5 ± 0.2
kcal mol–1 and −16 ± 1 cal mol–1 K–1, respectively.52

Free Energies
Results and Discussion
Energetics
and Structural Consideration of Complexes
The optimized geometrical
parameters of Rh(I) and Rh(III) complexes
between the metal and various ligands do not vary much from method
to method. In Rh(I) PCP complex, the Rh–C and Rh–P bond
distances computed with B3LYP-D3 method are 2.068 and 2.326 Å,
respectively, while the same respective bond distances computed at
M06-2X-D3 are 2.047 and 2.331 Å. For Rh(III) complex (cis-form
complex, reaction D), the Rh–P and Rh–H distances computed
at B3LYP-D3 are 2.347 and 1.597 Å, respectively. The same bond
distances computed at M06-2X-D3 are 2.323 and 1.569 Å, respectively.

The transition-metal complexes containing phosphines with either
iso-propyl (iPr), tert-butyl (tBu), or other types of groups can have a number of conformational
and rotational isomers by the rotation of these groups with respect
to each other. Neglecting these conformational changes can have huge
impact on the accuracy of computed results in such complexes. Therefore,
care must be taken while choosing the true ground-state structure
before computing the free energy of these complexes. After carrying
conformational analysis of Rh(I) PCP–pincer complex, the rotation
of tBu groups of the phosphines does have many conformers.
However, there are four major conformers represented as Form I, Form
II, Form III, and Form IV shown in Scheme 2 based on the position of one tBu group with respect to the other (Sym or Asym). Out of these four
conformers, Form III is the most stable conformation which involves
agostic interactions between the Rh and the two tBu groups instead of four, as predicted by Fujita and co-workers.49 The minimum energy structure is close to Form
III and it is used as a ground-state structure in our calculations,
which was further confirmed from DFT as well as an X-ray crystallographic
structure.54 Moreover, the binding of small
molecules such as H2, N2, C2H4, and so forth, with the metal center does not affect the
structure of the complex upon binding. Likewise, the structure of
[(H)2Rh(dmpe)2]+ for reactions C
and D has to be trans-octahedral and distorted cis-octahedral
in nature, respectively.50 The geometry
of [Rh(dmpe)2]+ is square-planar in nature;
however, when dmpe (dimethyl phosphine ethyl) is replaced with dmpp
(dimethyl phosphine propyl) groups, the geometry of the complex changes
from square-planar to a distorted tetrahedral geometry.55 The structure of Rh complexes for reactions
E and F was directly taken from the X-ray crystallographic structures.51,52

Scheme 2 Conformational Isomers in Rh-Based PCP–Pincer Complex
Computed Free Energy of Reactions
Inspired by the use
of Rh complexes in homogeneous catalysis, we examined the accuracy
of 17 functionals for predicting the thermochemistry of reactions
shown in Scheme 1.
The experimentally reported reaction-free energy of these reactions
was taken from the literature, determined by NMR and spectrophotometric
equilibrium studies at 25 °C.49−52 All these values are listed below
each reaction in Scheme 1 along with their reference. Reactions A and B are ligand-exchange
reactions involving binding of η2-H2 and
η2-C2H4 to the PCP–Rh
pincer complex by replacing N2 in cyclohexane. Reaction
C is a hydride elimination reaction in which the solvent molecule,
CH3CN, binds itself to the Rh complex by eliminating the
hydride ion, while reaction D is a dihydrogen elimination reaction.
Reaction E is an exchange reaction between the coordinated H2O with chloride ion in aqueous media, while reaction F is Si–H
activation reaction in benzene in which simultaneous loss of CO ligand
from the complex takes place. The computed energetics and optimized
geometrical coordinates of all the chemical species involved in these
reactions are given in detail in the Supporting Information.

The computed TR/BS1 and TR/BS1/BS2 reaction
free-energy values for reaction A are shown in Figure 1 and their mean unsigned and signed errors
(MUE and MSE) are listed in Table 1. As it is apparent from the TR/BS1 results, the best
performance is shown by the hybrid-meta-GGA, MPWB1K-D3 functional
with 44% HF exchange having minimum deviation (ΔGcal – ΔGexpt)
from the experiment equal to +0.8 kcal mol–1 (the
deviations of computed Gibbs free-energy values from experimental
reported values are given in detail in Table S1 of the Supporting Information). This functional is best
suited for thermochemical calculations as suggested by Truhlar.68 The other hybrid-meta-GGA functional such as
M06 (27% HF exchange) and M06-2X-D3 (54% HF exchange) also provide
reasonably good results with their deviations (+2.3 and +1.8 kcal
mol–1, respectively) from experimental value. It
is noteworthy to mention here that the hybrid-meta-GGA functionals
with high HF exchange percentage show better results than functionals
with relatively low HF exchange percentage. Like other hybrid-meta-GGA
functionals, the meta-GGA functional, M06-L, also gives satisfactory
results and is deviating by +1.8 kcal mol–1 from
the experiment. The hybrid functionals such as B3PW91 and B3LYP (20%
HF exchange) also reproduce good results with deviations +1.4 and
+1.5 kcal mol–1, respectively, which are close to
that of the MPWB1K-D3 functional. The PBE0 hybrid functional, which
contains 25% Fock exchange, also performs better with deviation equal
to +0.8 kcal mol–1. The hybrid GGA, MPW1K, is the
second best functional after MPWB1K-D3 with deviation equal to −1.3
kcal mol–1. The GGA functional such as PBE do not
furnish good results either and the result deviates by +4.8 kcal mol–1 from the experiment. The B97-D3 functional produced
inferior results deviating by +7.9 kcal mol–1 from
the experiment and is not recommended for studying such kind of Rh(I)-mediated
chemical transformations. The second protocol (TR/BS1/BS2) do not
procreate good results except for BHandHYLP and MPW1K functionals,
and such computational schemes are also discouraged for studying such
reactions. This reaction is highly sensitive to dispersion correction
and inclusion of it does not improve the accuracy of the results;
instead, they reproduce poor results compared to uncorrected functionals.
The probable reason for such poor performance might be due to the
σ-complexation between the metal and H2. These effects
of “D3” dispersion correction on the accuracy of results
are more pronounced in hybrid functionals (B3LYP and B3PW91) than
hybrid-meta-GGA functionals such as M06, which is understandable because
of some inbuilt dispersion correction in the latter ones.

are shown in bold.

Reaction
B is similar to reaction A, which involves addition of
η2-C2H4 to Rh(I) PCP–pincer
complex instead of η2-H2. In this case,
M06-2X-D3 is unimpeachably the best functional with +0.5 kcal mol–1 deviation from the experiment when TR/BS1 computational
scheme is considered (Figure 1). The hybrid-meta-GGA functional, MPWB1K-D3, also performs
well for this type of reaction deviating by −1.7 kcal mol–1 from the experimentally reported value. It is noteworthy
to mention here that among the hybrid-meta-GGA functionals, good results
are shown by those functionals with higher HF exchange (e.g., M06-2X-D3
has 54% HF exchange, while as MPWB1K-D3 functional has 44% HF exchange).
However, the hybrid functional, M06, overestimates the free energy
by +5.2 kcal mol–1 from the experiment with just
27% HF exchange. The M06-L functional also produced reasonable results
for reaction B as well with deviation equal to +4.0 kcal mol–1. Unlike reaction A, PBE and the hybrid DFT methods B3PW91 and B3LYP
overwhelmingly deviate from the experiment (+8.6, +7.3, and +9.1 kcal
mol–1, respectively). The BHandHYLP functional performs
reasonably well compared to other hybrid functionals (+3.1 kcal mol–1). The PBE0 functional also like other hybrid functionals
do not reproduce good results, and it deviates from the experiment
by +4.9 kcal mol–1. The results are very sensitive
to dispersion corrections for this type of reaction, and introducing
“D3” dispersion correction significantly improves the
results of all DFT methods except for the B97-D functional. For example,
the PBE0-D3 functional deviates by just +2.4 kcal mol–1, which is a significant improvement from +4.9 kcal mol–1 without dispersion. It is noteworthy to mention here that the TR/BS1/BS2
protocol also improves the results.

For reaction C, out of all
the functionals tested, the best performance
is given by PBE (−1.5 kcal mol–1), while
M06-L gives worse results as shown in Figure 1, and this method deviates by −16.2
kcal mol–1 from the experiment. The inclusion of
“D3” dispersion correction does not improve the results;
instead, its use decreases the accuracy of the results. The accuracy
of the results heavily relies on the accuracy of computed electronic
energy of hydride ion. The more the accurate the electronic energy
is, the more is the accuracy of free energy of hydride ion and thus
more is the accuracy of the results. Therefore, using TR/BS1/BS2 protocol
enhances the improvement in results except for BHandHYLP. However,
this improvement is small in the case of PBE and PBE-D3 functionals.

Reaction D involves the elimination of H2 from the distorted cis-octahedral complex and the computation of free energy
of such type of reaction is difficult. Several key factors need to
keep in mind before computing free energy of such type of reactions.
First, such reactions involve the increase in number of molecules
and thus total free energy is added by a factor of 1.89 kcal mol–1, considering the standard-state conversion from 1
atm to 1 mol. Second, because of the dissociation of one molecule
to two, the significant errors can arise in the calculations, particularly
basis set superposition errors, errors due to overestimation of entropic
term, and the solvation errors of separate molecules formed during
the reaction. As far as this reaction is concerned, the best functional
is PBE0-D3 because of its minimum deviation (−0.3 kcal mol–1, TR/BS1 protocol) from the experiment. The PBE functional
with and without “D3” dispersion correction also give
good performance (−0.4 and −2.3 kcal mol–1, respectively) and is second best of all the functionals examined
in this study. The MPWB1K-D3 functional again shows much better performance
(+0.5 kcal mol–1) followed by MPW1K (−1.1
kcal mol–1). All the hybrid functionals performed
reasonably well, particularly the D3-corrected functionals such as
B3PW91-D3 (−1.9 kcal mol–1). However, B3LYP
with and without dispersion reproduces worse results as shown in Figure 1. Notably, the M06-L
functional does not provide satisfactory results (−4.7 kcal
mol–1); however, it gives much better performance
than M06 and M06-2X-D3 (−11.5 and −9.3 kcal mol–1, respectively). The interesting observation here
is that increasing the HF exchange percentage in the hybrid functionals
enhances the accuracy of results. For example, B3LYP and B3PW91 with
20% HF exchange are having deviations equal to −8.6 and −5.4
kcal mol–1, respectively. In contrast to this, BHandHYLP
and PBE0 with 50 and 25% HF exchange are much closer to the experimental
values with deviation equal to +1.4 and −2.5, respectively.
The inclusion of D3 dispersion correction has a huge impact on the
accuracy of results and its inclusion improves the results. The TR/BS1/BS2
protocol does not improve the accuracy of functionals used except
for BHandHLYP and MPWB1K-D3 whose deviation decreases from +1.4 to
+0.6 and +0.5 to −0.3 kcal mol–1, respectively.

In reaction E, Cl– replaces the H2O coordinated with the Rh(III) center, and among all the DFT methods
tested, the PBE0 functional shows impressive performance (TR/BS1 protocol)
with and without D3 dispersion correction having −0.3 kcal
mol–1 deviation from the experiment. After PBE0,
it is B3LYP and M06-L functionals which procreate good results with
their respective deviations equal to −0.7 and 1.7 kcal mol–1 from the experiment. The BHandHYLP functional with
50% Hartree–Fock exchange is the worst functional of all the
DFT methods tested (−11.5 kcal mol–1 deviation).
The second computational protocol TR/BS1/BS2 enhances the accuracy
of DFT results. Finally, including dispersion correction in DFT functionals
makes the results worse as displayed in Figure 1.

For reaction F, the performance of
hybrid functionals B3PW91, M06,
and PBE0 is almost similar with their respective deviations +16.2,
+15.4, and +10.6 kcal mol–1 (TR/BS1 protocol). The
hybrid B3LYP functional is slightly on the higher side with deviation
equal to +24.3 kcal mol–1. The M06-2X-D3 functional
is impressive of all the functionals tested with lowest value of deviation
(+0.4 kcal mol–1). The PBE0-D3 functional is the
second best functional after M06-2X-D3 deviating by +1.1 kcal mol–1 from the experiment. The B97-D functional also produces
good results with its low deviation from the experimental value (+2.0
kcal mol–1). The M06-L functional also do not reproduce
good results and deviates by +8.8 kcal mol–1. Moreover,
the MPWB1K-D3 functional again reproduces good results with deviation
−2.5 kcal mol–1. It is interestingly notable
that dispersion correction plays a crucial role in the performance
of DFT functionals. The dispersion correction functionals are exceptionally
best compared to the uncorrected ones, and the performance dramatically
enhances after adding dispersion correction in the functionals with
large effects in some cases as portrayed in Figure 1. Of all the functionals, the highest influence
of introducing dispersion correction has been found in the case of
B3LYP functional (difference of ∼15 kcal mol–1). The TR/BS1/BS2 computational protocol reduces the accuracy of
functionals.

The experimental enthalpy ΔH° = −5.5
± 0.2 kcal mol–1 and entropy ΔS° = −16 ± 1 cal mol–1 K–1 are also reported for reaction F.52 Thus, we calculated errors in our computed enthalpy
and entropy and their total contribution toward the overall free-energy
error of the reaction. As listed in Table 2, the errors in enthalpy computed by functionals
without dispersion correction are significantly higher compared to
their entropy errors while the opposite is the case for functionals
with dispersion correction. For example, the errors in enthalpy and
entropy for B3LYP functional are +19.0 kcal mol–1 and −3.5 cal mol–1 K–1 while the same values for B3LYP-D3 functional are +4.3 kcal mol–1 and −16.4 cal mol–1 K–1, respectively. While studying the mechanism of alcohol-mediated
Morita Baylis–Hillman reaction, Singleton and Plata predicted
that entropy is not a major contributor to the large computational
errors.56 However, in our case, such statement
is correct only for functionals without D3 dispersion correction except
for PBE-D3 and M06-D3. The importance of using dispersion-corrected
functionals for studying reaction F is depicted by the small cancellation
of errors in best performing functionals such as B3PW91-D3, B97-D3,
M06-2X-D3, MPWB1K-D3, and PBE0-D3. For example, the M06-2X-D3 functional
is having enthalpy error equal to +0.5 kcal mol–1, while the entropy error is −5.4 cal mol–1 K–1, which becomes +2.1 kcal mol–1 at 297 K. Thus, the good performance of this functional (with deviation
+0.4 kcal mol–1) and other dispersion-corrected
functionals is mainly due to inclusion of dispersion correction and
not only because of cancellation of errors.

Comparison of Results with Literature
There are limited
studies available in the literature regarding Rh(I) complexes. Thus,
it would be appropriate to compare the results with some related studies.
Of these, recent study by Chen and co-workers assessed the accuracy
of DFT methods for H–H σ-bond heterolytic cleavage over
Rh(III) complexes and they reported that M06-L, M06, B3LYP, and PBE0
are the best functionals for studying such reactions.47 However, in our present case, the η2-H2 addition over Rh(I) PCP pincer complex is considered (reaction
A) and the common finding in both the studies is that PBE0, B3LYP,
and M06 perform reasonably well. It would be slightly more appropriate
to compare their results with reaction D in which the homolytic cleavage
of H–H over Rh(III) complex takes place (reverse reaction).
According to their findings, the best performing functionals for reaction
energy are PBE0 and B3LYP, especially the dispersion-corrected ones,
which is similar to our computed results. Moreover, as per Chen et
al., inclusion of dispersion correction is beneficial for most DFT
functionals, which is again in accordance with our results. Concerning
H–H σ-bond homolytic cleavage over Rh(I) complex, Neese
and co-workers reported B3LYP to be the best functional, which is
also in accordance with our computed results.57

Conclusions
In this study, we tested the accuracy of
various density functionals
with and without dispersion correction for predicting the free energy
of η2-H2, η2-C2H4, and Cl– ligand-exchange reactions,
hydride elimination reaction, H2 elimination reaction,
and Si–H activation reaction mediated by Rh complexes, comprising
total six reactions. In total, 17 density functionals and two computational
schemes were employed, represented as TR/BS1 and TR/BS1/BS2. The computed
results of all the functionals were compared with the free-energy
values already available in the literature.

For reaction A,
of all the density functionals tested, MPWB1K-D3
and PBE0 are outstanding best deviating from experimental data by
+0.8 kcal mol–1. The hybrid functionals such as
B3LYP, B3PW91, and BHandHYLP were also good with deviations lesser
than 2 kcal mol–1. The hybrid-GGA, MPW1K, and the
dispersion-corrected global-hybrid meta-GGA, M06-2X-D3, functionals
also performed well (−1.3 and +1.8 kcal mol–1, respectively). For reaction B, the MPWB1K-D3 functional was impressive
followed by M06-2X-D3, while it is the PBE functional that is most
suited for reaction C. Similarly, for reaction D, PBE0-D3 and PBE
(with and without dispersion correction) are outstanding functionals
for studying Rh-mediated catalytic reactions with their deviations
less than 1 kcal mol–1 when compared with experiment.
For reaction E, PBE0, M06-L, and B3LYP showed impressive performance
with deviation less than 2 kcal mol–1. Likewise,
for reaction F, the M06-2X-D3, PBE0-D3, and MPWB1K functionals again
reproduced undoubtedly the best results.

The inclusion of dispersion
correction has huge impact on the accuracy
of results and the functionals with dispersion correction increasing
the accuracy of results for reactions B and D. However, for reaction
A, significant errors arise and thus use of dispersion-corrected functionals
should be avoided for studying Rh(I)-mediated reactions in which exchange
of N2 with η2-H2 takes place.
For reaction F, the accuracy of the results heavily relies on the
dispersion correction of the functional used. Moreover, employing
TR/BS1/BS2 computational scheme does not improve the accuracy of results
either except for reaction C and thus the use of such schemes is also
discouraged.

In all the reactions, the PBE0-D3 and MPWB1K-D3
functionals are
undoubtedly the best based on their minimum MUE values (3.2 and 3.4
kcal mol–1, respectively). The other functionals
are good in one reaction but perform badly in another, and thus, it
is concluded here that MPWB1K-D3 and PBE0-D3 functionals and TR/BS1
computational scheme are preferred as far as Rh-mediated chemical
transformations are concerned.

Computational Details
The geometry
optimizations of
all the complexes without any truncations were carried out by employing
all 17 density functionals, namely, B3LYP,58,59 B3LYP-D3,58−61 BHandHYLP,58−62 PBE,63 PBE-D3,63 PBE0-D3,64 PBE0,64 M06,65 M06-D3,65 M06-L,66 M06-2X-D3,67 MPW1K,68 MPWB1K-D3,69 B3PW91,59,70 B3PW91-D3,59,70 B97-D,71 and B97-D3,71 in conjunction with the 6-31+G(d,p)72 basis set for all nonmetallic atoms and LACVP**+73,74 pseudopotential and basis set for Rh (BS1). All the optimizations
were carried out first in gas phase and then solvent effects were
incorporated employing Poisson–Boltzmann finite element solvation
model.75,76 No significant geometry change was observed
during such optimization scheme. The optimizations of all the complexes
were carried out in cyclohexane (reactions A and B), acetonitrile
(reactions C and D), water (reaction E), and benzene (reaction F)
as reported in the literature. The ground-state structures were confirmed
by analyzing the harmonic frequency data with no imaginary frequency
computed on the above said optimized geometries. The reaction-free
energies calculated by the above said method (without using any scaling
factor) are termed as TR/BS1. The single-point energy of all the complexes
was also computed using the 6–311++G(d,p) basis set for all
nonmetallic atoms and LACVP**++ for Rh atom (BS2). The BS2 single-point
energies of the complexes were calculated using maximum grid density
and ultrafine SCF. The BS1 single-point energies in TR/BS1 were replaced
by the BS2 single-point energies as per the equation, namely, GBS2 = GBS1 – EBS1 + EBS2 and such
results are designated as TR/BS1/BS2.

The equation ΔGgas→sol = kTln(24.5)
= 1.89 kcal mol–1 corresponds to a change in free
energy on going from standard gas-phase (1 atm) to liquid-state (1
M) conversion. The total free energy of reaction D was corrected (added)
by the same factor (1.89 kcal mol–1) as the increase
in the number of moles during the course of reaction.77 All the above said calculations were carried out in experimentally
reported conditions using Jaguar program as implemented in the Schrodinger
Suite of program.78
