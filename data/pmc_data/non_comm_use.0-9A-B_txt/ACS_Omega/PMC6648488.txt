Catalytic hydrolysis
of carbonyl sulfide (COS) over metal frameworks
derived MgAlCe composite oxides catalyst is investigated under N2 and CO atmosphere. A combination of experimental and theoretical
methods, including in situ IR, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and
density functional theory calculations, is used to explain the difference
of catalytic activity. Research results indicate that M–OH
groups play the most important role in COS hydrolysis, but the distribution
of the M–OH groups is affected by CO. There is no competitive
adsorption effect between N2 and COS on the surface of
catalyst but CO and COS. Meanwhile, the hydrolysis reaction of COS
is an instantaneous reaction and a noninstantaneous reaction under
N2 and CO atmosphere, respectively. In general, under N2 atmosphere, COS is directly adsorbed on the surface of the
catalyst and most of the −OH groups are adsorbed as M–OH
formation. Under CO atmosphere, most of the active sites occur as
CO due to the competitive adsorption effect.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Carbonyl sulfide (COS)
is one of the main organic sulfur compounds
in industrial tail gases, such as closed carbide furnace tail gas,
coke oven gas, and yellow phosphorus tail gas.1−3 In these industrial
tail gases, CO (>75%) is an important resource for C1 chemical
industry.
However, the existence of COS is not conducive to the purification
of CO, which leads to environmental pollution and equipment corrosion.4−6 Therefore, it is important to remove COS from these industrial tail
gases. So far, catalytic hydrolysis method is regarded as the suitable
way for the removal of COS because of high removal efficiency, low
operation cost, and mild reaction condition.7−11 The hydrolysis products of COS are CO2 and H2S.12−16 H2S can be removed more easily than COS. In our previous
study, hydrotalcite-like compounds-derived MgAlCe composite oxides
(MgAlCeOx) show 100% COS removal efficiency
under N2 atmosphere condition.17 However, the main component in industrial gas is CO. The carrier
gas condition can change the removal efficiency and process. Therefore,
it is necessary to investigate the effect of carrier gas for COS removal
process.

In this work, MgAlCeOx is
prepared
for catalytic hydrolysis of COS. The influence of carrier gases (CO
and N2) is investigated by experiment and density functional
theory (DFT) calculation. In situ IR and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analyses are used to further explain and carry out the removal
process of COS over MgAlCeOx under different
carrier gas conditions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of N2 and CO Atmosphere
on Catalytic Activity
The catalytic activity of MgAlCeOx under CO and N2 is shown in Figure 1. H2S
can be detected at the outlet of the reactor, which indicates that
the removal of COS is a catalytic hydrolysis process. As seen in Figure 1, COS conversion
rate keeps 100% for 60 min and then decreased over time under N2 atmosphere. However, COS conversion rate first increases
from 83 to 88% (at 40 min) and then decreases over time under CO atmosphere.
It indicates that carrier gas affects the removal process of COS.
The difference is attributed to the interaction of the catalyst and
COS/N2/CO, and the competitive adsorption among COS/N2/CO. Furthermore, COS conversion rate under N2 atmosphere
is still higher than that under CO atmosphere. It shows that MgAlCeOx has lower catalytic activity in the industrial
gas than that in the N2 atmosphere. To find out the detailed
effect of carrier gas, in situ IR, XPS analyses, and DFT calculation
are carried out.

Figure 1 Removal of COS over MgAlCeOx under
N2 and CO atmosphere (reaction condition: 470 ppm COS,
2.67% relative humidity (RH), 5000 h–1 gas hourly
space velocity (GHSV), reaction temperature = 50 °C).

2.2 In Situ IR Analysis
To investigate
the change of surface functional groups on the catalysts under CO
and N2, in situ IR is carried out and is shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2, these peaks located at 3600–3700
cm–1 are attributed to the vibration of −OH
groups, including linear −OH groups M–OH (at 3697 cm–1), bridged bonded −OH groups M–(OH)–M
(at 3664 cm–1), and triply bonded −OH groups
M–(M–OH)–M (at 3631 cm–1).
The peak located at 1726 cm–1 is attributed to the
vibration of the=C=O groups.

Figure 2 In situ IR experiments
of COS removal over MgAlCeOx under (a)
N2 and (b) CO atmosphere (reaction
condition: 470 ppm COS, 2.67% RH, 5000 h–1 GHSV,
reaction temperature = 50 °C).

From Figure 2a,
linear −OH groups M–OH are the main −OH groups
under N2 atmosphere. From Figure 2b, bridged bonded −OH groups M–(OH)–M
and triply bonded −OH groups M–(M–OH)–M
are the main −OH groups under CO atmosphere. It indicates that
the species of −OH groups is affected by N2 and
CO, which might be attributed to the competitive adsorption effect
between −OH groups and N2/CO. Under N2 atmosphere (in Figure 2a), the peak intensity of the M–OH and =C=O
groups decreases over time, indicating that the M–OH and =C=O
groups participate in the hydrolysis reaction. Under CO atmosphere
(in Figure 2b), the
peak of M–OH is weakened over time, but there is no obvious
change for M–(OH)–M, M–(M–OH)–M,
and =C=O groups. It indicates that M–(OH)–M
and M–(M–OH)–M groups have less promotional effect
on COS hydrolysis. Coupled with the catalytic activity results shown
in Figure 1, M–OH
groups play the most important role in COS hydrolysis.

CO is
a polar molecule, and it might be adsorbed on the surface
of the catalyst. Under CO atmosphere, the amount of M–(OH)–M
and M–(M–OH)–M groups are higher than that of
M–OH groups, which indicates that CO has a competitive adsorption
effect on −OH groups. It leads to the fact that most −OH
groups appear on the surface of the catalyst in the formation of M–(OH)–M
and M–(M–OH)–M. As a result, less M–OH
groups provide less catalytic activity. Furthermore, the amount of
CO is higher than COS, which leads to a competitive adsorption effect
between COS and CO. Because the dipole moment value of COS is bigger
than CO, COS would adsorb on the surface of the catalyst after CO.
Therefore, COS removal rate is lower under the industrial atmosphere
(CO) than under N2 atmosphere. The in situ IR results are
in agreement with the experimental results. According to the above
in situ IR results and the experimental results, the distribution
of different −OH groups on the surface of catalyst is shown
in Figure 3.

of −OH groups on the surface of catalyst.

2.3 XPS Analysis
To further investigate
the difference of catalytic activity under CO and N2 atmosphere.
XPS characterization is carried out and used to examine the composition
of different metals on the surface of catalyst.18 It provides a basis for constructing a computational model.
As shown in Figure 4, Mg–O (49.6 eV), Al–O (74.3 eV), and Ce–O (882.1
eV) are the principal formations for Mg 2p, Al 2p, and Ce 3d, respectively.
Based on the C content, the relative contents of Mg, Al, and Ce are
calculated, and the relative proportions of Mg, Al, and Ce are shown
in Table 1. From Table 1, Al content is highest
and Ce content is lowest. However, in the preparation of catalyst,
Mg content is higher than the Al content. It is attributed to that
part Mg adsorbs on the inner surface of crystal. According to above
XPS results, the structure of MgAlCeOx crystalline is built and shown in Figure 5a. Meanwhile, MgAlCeOx(110) surface (in Figure 5b) is used in the following calculation study.

Ce 3d).

2.4 Competitive
Adsorption of CO and COS on the
Surface of Catalyst
According to the in situ IR results in Figure 2, CO has a competitive
adsorption effect with −OH groups and COS. To further investigate
the competitive adsorption effect between CO and COS, the adsorption
energy is calculated and adsorptive site is investigated. From Table 2, there is no competitive
adsorption effect between N2 and COS because the adsorption
energy between N2 and catalyst is positive. Furthermore,
the adsorption energy (absolute value) between CO and catalyst (34.39
kJ/mol) is higher than that between COS and catalyst (18.27 kJ/mol).
It indicates that CO is more easily adsorbed on the surface of catalyst
than COS. The adsorption site of CO and COS on the surface of MgAlCeOx(110) is shown in Figure 6. As shown in Figure 6a, the adsorption site of CO on the surface
of catalyst is C···O (C from CO and O from MgAlCeOx(110)), and the bond length value of C···O
is 1.412 Å. From Figure 6b, the adsorption site of COS on the surface of catalyst is
C···O (C from COS and O from MgAlCeOx(110)), and the bond length value of C···O
is 1.607 Å. It indicates that CO is more stable than COS when
they are adsorbed on the surface of catalyst. Therefore, the hydrolysis
reaction of COS is an instantaneous reaction under N2 atmosphere,
and it is a noninstantaneous reaction under CO atmosphere.

Depending upon the
above in situ IR and calculation results, the
difference of catalytic activity under CO and N2 atmosphere
is shown in Figure 7. As shown in Figure 7, under N2 atmosphere, COS is directly adsorbed on the
surface of the catalyst. Meanwhile, most of the −OH groups
are adsorbed as M–OH formation, which could directly react
with COS. Under CO atmosphere, most of the active sites occurred as
CO, and few COS molecules are adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst.
It is attributed to the competitive adsorption effect by COS and CO.
Therefore, the noninstantaneous reaction is generated in CO atmosphere.
Quantum chemistry calculations corroborate the in situ IR results
and provide complementary information concerning the hydrolysis mechanism.

of catalytic activity under CO and N2 atmosphere.

3 Conclusions
This work systematically investigates the influence of different
carrier gases on COS catalytic hydrolysis over MgAlCeOx, including N2 and CO atmosphere. Experimental
results indicate that MgAlCeOx has lower
catalytic activity in the industrial gas than that in the N2 atmosphere. In situ IR results indicate that linear −OH groups
M–OH are the principal −OH groups under N2 atmosphere. Bridged bonded −OH groups M–(OH)–M
and triply bonded −OH groups M–(M–OH)–M
are the main −OH groups under CO atmosphere. The M–OH
groups play the most important role in COS hydrolysis. CO affects
the distribution of different −OH groups on the surface of
the catalyst due to the competitive adsorption effect between CO and
M–OH. The XPS results show that Mg–O, Al–O, and
Ce–O are the main formations for Mg 2p, Al 2p, and Ce 3d, respectively,
which provides the surface element proportion for building the crystal
structure. The calculation results indicate that CO is more easily
and stably adsorbed on the surface of catalyst than COS. Meanwhile,
the hydrolysis reaction of COS is an instantaneous reaction under
N2 atmosphere, and it is a noninstantaneous reaction under
CO atmosphere. In general, under N2 atmosphere, COS is
directly adsorbed on the surface of the catalyst and most of the −OH
groups are adsorbed as M–OH formation. Under CO atmosphere,
most of the active sites occurred as CO due to the competitive adsorption
effect.

4 Experimental and Theoretical Methods
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
MgAlCeOx is synthesized through our previous method.17 The preparation conditions are reproduced below.
The atomic ratio of Mg/Al/Ce is 34:16:1, and the mole ratio of NaOH/Na2CO3 is 1:1. The pH of the mixed metal salt solution
is adjusted by adding mixed alkaline solution until pH = 8. The hydrothermal
temperature is 140 °C. The calcination temperature is 600 °C
and calcination time is 3 h.

4.2 Characterization
XPS (ESCALAB 250)
analysis is performed at a base pressure in the analysis chamber of
5 × 10–10 mbar using Al Kα X-ray source
with excitation energies of 1486.6 eV. With the total instrumental
resolution of 1.18 eV for Al Kα excitation sources spectra is
recorded. The energy scale is calibrated by normalizing the C 1s line
of adsorbed adventitious hydrocarbons to 285.0 eV. In situ IR spectroscopy
is collected using a Nicolet iS50 FTIR spectrometer equipped with
a smart collector. The IR spectra are recorded by operating at accumulating
100 scans at a resolution of 4 cm–1.

4.3 Catalytic Activity Measurements
Desulfurization
tests are performed in a fixed-bed quartz reactor under atmospheric
pressure. The catalytic activity test system is same as our previous
system.17 In this study, the reaction conditions
are as follows: 470 ppm COS; 2.67% relative humidity (RH); 5000 h–1 gas hourly space velocity (GHSV); and 50 °C
reaction temperature. COS and H2S concentrations of the
gas feed and effluent from the reactor are analyzed using a FULI 9790II
gas chromatography. COS removal rate is obtained by calculating the
inlet and the outlet COS concentrations  

4.4 Computational Methods
All calculations
in this work are performed using Dmol3 program in the Material
Studio 2017 software package.19,20 The molecular geometry
(MgAlCeOx(110), COS, N2, and
CO) and the adsorption energy of COS/CO/N2 on MgAlCeOx(110) surface are calculated and optimized using
the GGA/PBE method with DNP basis.21 The
cell structure of MgAlCeOx is set based
on MgAlOx. The tolerance of the SCF, energy,
gradient, and displacement convergence are 1.0 × 10–6 hartree (Ha), 1.0 × 10–5 Ha, 2.0 × 10–3 Ha/Å, and 5.0 × 10–3 Å,
respectively. K value is 3 × 2 × 1. The
calculations are set to spin unrestricted. Ramírez-Dámaso
et al. found that the (110) surface is more reactive than other surface.22 Therefore, the (110) surface is considered in
this work. After cleaving the surface, the three-dimensional structure
is built with a vacuum slab of 150 nm.
