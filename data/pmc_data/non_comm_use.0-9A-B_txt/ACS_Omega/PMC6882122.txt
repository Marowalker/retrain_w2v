Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a highly infectious
prion disease of cervids. Accumulation of prions, the disease-specific
structural conformers of the cellular prion protein (PrPC), in the central nervous system, is the key pathological event of
the disorder. The analysis of cervid PrPC sequences revealed
the existence of polymorphism at position 226, in which deer PrP contains
glutamine (Q), whereas elk PrP contains glutamate (E). The effects
of this polymorphism on CWD are still unknown. We determined the high-resolution
nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the mule deer prion protein
that was compared to previously published PrP structures of elk and
white-tailed deer. We found that the polymorphism Q226E could influence
the long-range intramolecular interactions and packing of the β2−α2
loop and the C-terminus of the α3 helix of cervid PrP structures.
This solvent-accessible epitope is believed to be involved in prion
conversion. Additional differences were observed at the beginning
of the well-defined C-terminus domain, in the α2−α3
region, and in its interactions with the α1 helix. Here, we
highlight the importance of the PrP structure in prion susceptibility
and how single amino acid differences might influence the overall
protein folding.

Introduction
Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is an infectious
prion disease of free-ranging cervids. It has been reported in both
captive and wild cervid species, including elk (Cervus
canadensis), mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus
virginianus), red deer (Cervus elaphus), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and
moose (Alces alces).1−7 The disease has now been reported in 26 states of the United States,
three provinces of Canada, South Korea, Norway, Finland, and Sweden.7−12

Prion
diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies
(TSEs), are rapid, progressive, and devastating neurodegenerative
disorders, caused by misfolding events of the main α-helical
cellular prion protein (PrPC) to a β-sheet-enriched,
partially protease-resistant, and infectious isoform (PrPSc or prion).13,14 Although there is a lack of high-resolution
three-dimensional (3D) structural data for PrPSc (mostly
because of its insolubility and propensity to aggregate),15 the PrPC structure has been solved
by solution-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and crystallographic
methods. PrPC consists of a highly flexible N-terminal
segment (residues 23–124) and a folded C-terminus domain (residues
125–231).15,16 The C-terminus domain contains
three α-helices, spanning residues 144–154 (α1),
173–194 (α2), and 200–228 (α3), and two
short antiparallel β-strands comprising residues 128–131
(β1) and 161–164 (β2). The PrP expressed by mammalian
species exhibits a similar fold, with the local sequence and structure
variations most prominently localized at the interface of the β2−α2
loop and in the C-terminus part of the α3 helix.17

Among the mammalian prion diseases, CWD
is the most infectious form. Free-ranging cervids are at the highest
risk of exposure to CWD prions through direct horizontal transmission
via infectious agents such as saliva, urine, and feces or through
an indirect transmission occurring by environmental exposure to contaminated
and infectious material.18,19 The ability of PrPSc to selectively infect some mammalian species rather than
others is known as species barriers.20,21 The primary
structural identity between PrPC and PrPSc facilitates
prion transmission, thus influencing resistance or susceptibility
to prion conversion.22,23 Naturally occurring PrP polymorphisms
that alter prion disease susceptibility have been documented in many
species.24 In humans, the polymorphic residue
at codon 129 (M129V) influences the susceptibility to prion diseases,25 where the presence of valine induces the formation
of unstable intermolecular β-sheets, conflicting with the spatially
adjacent residues.26,27

Polymorphisms and few allelic
variations in the well-conserved Prnp gene within
the family Cervidae may influence the different susceptibility of
CWD progression and PrPSc infection.28,29 Polymorphisms
M132L and S225F in elk and mule deer are related to increased resistance
to CWD.28,30,31 Additionally,
a single difference in primary structure exists between elk and deer
PrP; elk PrP contains glutamic acid (E) at position 226, whereas deer
PrP contains glutamine (Q) at this position28,32 (Figure 1). Polymorphism Q226E
is related to the identification of biologically distinct prion strains
on the basis of different disease progressions in deer and elk.33,34 Recently, it was shown that amino acid variation at residue 226
of deer and elk PrP controls the disease onset and conformational
features of the resulting prions, thus confirming the presence of
different cervid strains.35 Moreover, replacement
of the coding sequence of mouse PrP with the deer or elk sequence
renders the mice highly susceptible to CWD prions. Therefore, the
analysis of structural features of PrP is of outstanding importance
for a better understanding of the pathogenesis and transmission of
TSEs.

CWD. Amino acid variants are marked with orange color. Residue numbering
is based on the mdPrP amino acid sequence. Secondary structural elements
are summarized based on the mdPrP structural model presented in this
article, with the α-helices of mdPrP denoted by green rectangles,
310-helices by light green rectangles, β-strands
by magenta arrows, flexible N-terminal tail by a curved line, and
linkers between the secondary structure elements by straight lines,
both lines colored champagne pink.

In the current study, we have determined a high-resolution
structure of the truncated recombinant mule deer PrP (from residues
94 to 233, hereafter indicated as mdPrP) with the use of NMR spectroscopy.
A comparison to previously determined PrP structures from the white-tailed
deer and Rocky Mountain elk36,37 provides insights that
may contribute to our understanding of how the single polymorphism
Q226E between deer and elk can alter the structure and help to explain
the substantial differences in biochemical properties, pathogenesis,
and formation of different strains of CWD prions among cervids.38 We hypothesized that the presence of polymorphism
Q226E, as the most critical for CWD among the six identified differences
in amino acid sequences, could influence the long-range intramolecular
interactions including the packing of the β2−α2
loop and the C-terminus of the α3 helix. This solvent-accessible
epitope has been studied greatly in view of its role in prion conversion.39,40 Additionally, the changes from the neutral to negatively charged
side chain at position 226 will influence the electrostatic surface
potential in this region, which is of great relevance for the intermolecular
interactions between PrPC and PrPSc among cervids.

Results and Discussion
Amino Acid Alignment and mdPrP Construct
The amino
acid sequences of PrPs from various cervid subspecies related to CWD
are highly evolutionary-conserved. The alignment of amino acid sequences
of mdPrP, white-tailed deer (wtdPrP), elk (ePrP), red deer PrP (reddPrP),
American moose PrP (amPrP), Eurasian moose PrP (emPrP), and reindeer
PrP (rdPrP) showed differences in the amino acid residues at positions
109, 123, 138, 176, 209, and 226 (Figure 1; numbering is based on the amino acid sequence
of the mdPrP construct used herein for structure determination). A
simple perusal of the differences shows that the three of them are
positioned within the well-defined secondary structural elements.
Truncated recombinant mdPrP from residues 94 to 233 with serine at
position 138 and glutamine at position 226 was used for structural
characterization and comparison with previously resolved wtdPrP and
ePrP structures.

Resonance Assignment and Structure Calculation
The 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum
of 13C, 15N doubly labeled mdPrP presents a
favorable dispersion of cross-peaks, indicating a high potential for
in-depth structural determination (Figure 2). Standard two-dimensional and 3D NMR experiments
were used for the assignment of backbone and side-chain resonances
of mdPrP. In short, the sequence-specific assignment of the backbone 1H, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonances for mdPrP
was obtained using the 15N-HSQC spectrum and triple-resonance
HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA, CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB experiments.41 The 1H and 13C resonances
of aliphatic and aromatic side chains were assigned using 13C-HSQC in combination with HAHB(CO)NH, CC(CO)NH, (H)CCH- total correlation
spectroscopy (TOCSY), and 13C-edited nuclear Overhauser
enhancement spectroscopy (NOESY)-HSQC experiments.42 NOE contacts were determined in 3D 15N and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments. The overall completeness
of chemical shift assignment was 99.1%. Noteworthily, the side-chain
resonances including CHε of His99, His114, and Tyr152 and CHζ of Phe178 and Phe201 could not be unambiguously assigned;
however, this agrees very well with the final structure and properties
of the studied protein. We have considered the use of residual dipolar
couplings for structure improvement, especially interhelical orientations.
However, the use of aligning media was showed to induce sample precipitation
of PrPs.

assignment. Cross-peaks of the side chains of Asn, Gln, and Trp are
not marked.

The high-resolution structure of mdPrP was calculated
using 545 intraresidual, 618 sequential, 482 medium-range, and 559
long-range distance restraints complemented with 168 backbone torsion
angle restraints (Table 1). The calculated structure of mdPrP (PDB ID: 6FNV) is composed of
two distinct domains. The highly disordered N-terminal domain consists
of residues from Gly94 to Gly122, whereas the
well-defined C-terminus domain is composed of residues from Ala123 to Ala233 and exhibits a backbone root-mean-square
deviation (rmsd) of 0.42 Å (Figure 3A and Table 1).

The C-terminus domain of mdPrP is characterized
by a compact set of three α-helices and a short antiparallel
β-sheet. The α1 helix is composed of residues from Asp147 to Asn156 and is followed by the 310-helix turn from Met157 to Arg159. The geometry
of α1 helix is classified as kinked according to the HELANAL
web server.46,47 The α2 and α3 helices
are longer than the α1 helix and are composed of residues from
Gln175 to Lys197 and from Glu203 to
Gln230, respectively. The geometries of α2 and α3
helices are linear and of curved type, respectively. The helices α2
and α3 form a twisted V-shaped skeleton that serves as a platform
for anchoring the α1 helix and β-sheet. The antiparallel
β-sheet is formed at the beginning of the C-terminus domain
and consists of two β strands, β1 and β2, that are
composed of residues from Met132 to Leu133 and
from Tyr165 to Tyr166, respectively. The structure
of mdPrP is stabilized by a disulfide bond between Cys182 and Cys217 that is located in the middle of α2
and α3 helices.

Unique Structural Features of the mdPrP Protein
We
observed the structuring of the region at the beginning of the C-terminus
domain of mdPrP. This region consists of nine residues from Ala123 to Tyr131 and adopts a well-defined structure
with the backbone rmsd of 0.22 Å (Figure 3B). It is characterized by an α-helical
turn and a γ-turn that are stabilized by three hydrogen bonds
(Figure 3C). The carbonyl
group of Val125 is involved in a bifurcated hydrogen bond
with the amide protons of Leu128 and Gly129 in
the α-helical turn. In addition, a hydrogen bond is formed between
the carbonyl group of Leu128 and the amide proton of Gly130 in the γ-turn. An hydrophobic pocket in this region
is formed by Val125, Leu128, and Tyr131 (Figure 3B,C).

Additionally, the β2−α2 loop of the mdPrP structure
is well defined with one turn of 310-helix from the residues
Val169 to Gln171 (Figure 3D) held together by the Gln171HN–Pro168O and Tyr172HN–Val169O hydrogen bonds (Figure 3E). The β2−α2
loop is further stabilized by hydrophobic and aromatic interactions
with the nearby amino acid residues at the C-terminus of the α3
helix. The hydrophobic pocket defined by the β2−α2
loop and the C-terminus of the α3 helix is composed of residues
Tyr166, Val169, Tyr172, Phe178, Tyr221, and Tyr228 (Figure 3D).

The above structuring of the region
before the well-defined C-terminus domain and the β2−α2
loop is supported further with the study of backbone dynamics. We
analyzed 118 resolved amide resonances of mdPrP on a fast (picoseconds
to nanoseconds) timescale with the use of 15N relaxation
time measurements at two magnetic fields (14.1 and 18.8 T). The resulting 15N longitudinal (R1), transverse
(R2), and rotating frame (R1ρ) relaxation rates combined with {1H}–15N heteronuclear NOE (hNOE) conform to the
flexible N-terminal tail and a well-structured C-terminus domain of
the mdPrP structure (Figure 4).

Figure 4 15N amide backbone relaxation rates and hNOE
of mdPrP. (A) 15N longitudinal (R1 = 1/T1), (B) transverse (R2 = 1/T2), (C) spin–lattice
relaxation rates in the rotation frame (R1ρ = 1/T1ρ), and (D) hNOE at 298
K at a magnetic field of 14.1 (magenta) and 18.8 T (blue). A schematic
presentation of the secondary structure elements of mdPrP is at the
top of the figure. For clarity, error bars are not shown here as they
are within the size of the data points in the above graphics but are
presented in the Supporting Information in Figure S1.

Furthermore, 15N relaxation data indicate
structuring for residues from Ala123 to Tyr131 at the beginning of the C-terminus domain and for the β2−α2
loop. On the other hand, 15N relaxation data show an increased
mobility for residues from Lys197 to Phe201 that
connect α2 and α3 helices and for residues from Tyr229 to Ala233 at the C-terminus of the mdPrP structure.
However, the relative lower values of R2 and R1ρ relaxation rates for residues
around Ile142 and Gln189 are not indicative
of a well-defined secondary structure and suggest more complex dynamics
coupled to their intricate tertiary interaction. Few amino acid residues
could not be analyzed because of the cross-peak overlap (for details,
see Methods).

Comparison of Structures of mdPrP and Other Cervids
Cervid prion proteins exhibit a well-conserved amino acid sequence,
which may suggest similarity of their 3D structures. We compared our
mdPrP structure with the structures of previously determined PrPs
from white-tailed deer and Rocky mountain elk and observed several
differences. For easier comparison of cervids’ PrP structures,
we unified the residue numbering based on the mdPrP amino acid sequence.
Here, we have to mention that the wtdPrP structure was determined
in complex with an antibody fragment POM1 at pH 6.8; however, the
PDB entry for wtdPrP includes residues from 128 to 228 (PDB ID: 4YXH).36 The ePrP structure consists of residues from 124 to 234
(PDB ID: 1XYW) and was determined at pH 4.5.37 We used
pH of 5.5 for structure determination because the lower pH prevents
aggregation and enables longevity of the prion protein samples that
is necessary for structure determination by NMR spectroscopy. Additionally,
it has been suggested that misfolding of PrPs in prion disease occurs
in endosomes that exhibit a low pH (pH ≈ 5).48 In general, the fold of mdPrP is grossly similar to wtdPrP
and ePrP structures (Figure 5A), even though the structures were determined under different
sample conditions.

We compared the chemical shifts (δ)
of amide proton (HN), Cα, and Cβ atoms of amino
acids from 124 to 233 between the mdPrP and ePrP structures determined
by NMR spectroscopy (Figure S2). The chemical
shifts of HN, Cα, and Cβ atoms of mdPrP and
ePrP showed good agreement along the sequence. Slight, if not negligible,
differences have been observed for δ(HN) and δ(Cα)
for the amino acid residues in the α2−α3 loop,
which could indicate different long-range interactions among amino
acids in this region. The calculated rmsd for the protein backbone
of the three compared structures (residues 128–228) is 1.2
Å. The local backbone rmsd values per residue are in good agreement
with the observed differences among the examined structures (Table S1, Figures 5 and 6). The main differences
in backbone rmsd values between the mdPrP and ePrP structures have
been detected at the N-terminal of the α1 helix and at the α2−α3
loop (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Local rmsd values for backbone atoms per residue (from
128 to 228) of mdPrP (green) and ePrP (magenta) with respect to the
wtdPrP structure that was determined by X-ray. Standard deviations
are reported for the ensemble of 20 lowest energy structures of mdPrP
and ePrP.

However, despite a very high level
of numerical similarity, structural differences are observed at the
beginning of the C-terminus domains, β2−α2 loops
and their interactions with α3 helices, at the beginning of
α1 helices and their interactions with α2 and α3
helices, and α2−α3 loops (Figures 5 and S3).

Residues from Val124 to Gly130 in ePrP exhibit
an extended backbone conformation. Similarly, the residues from Leu128 to Gly130 in the wtdPrP structure have no observed
structuring. Both regions of ePrP and wtdPrP structures exhibit no
hydrogen bonds in contrast to mdPrP, where we observed three hydrogen
bonds (Figures 3C, 5A and S3). No hydrophobic
pocket was observed in this region of ePrP or wtdPrP structures, whereas
mdPrP exhibits a well-defined hydrophobic pocket composed by the residues
Val125, Leu128, Tyr131, and Ile185. The backbone structures of the three proteins exhibit
similar conformations after the residue Gly130. Interestingly,
within the examined structures, Tyr131 exhibits a diverse
side-chain orientation and distinct stacking with Tyr166 and Ile185. The relative position of Tyr131 side chain and its interactions with the residues in proximity might
have an impact on the formation of the α-helical turn and γ-turn
in mdPrP in contrast to wtdPrP and ePrP. Solvent accessibility analysis
with the GETAREA program49,50 showed that the Tyr131 residue is protected from exchange with solvents in all
three structures (Figure S4). However,
the distance between Tyr131 and Ile185 in the
α2 helix is 2 times longer in mdPrP and ePrP structures in comparison
to the wtdPrP structure (Table S2). In
contrast, the distance between Leu128 and Ile185 is shorter in the mdPrP structure with respect to the distances
in ePrP and wtdPrP structures (Table S2). These observations indicate differences in interactions between
the β1−α1−β2 and α2−α3
subdomains of the compared structures. It was previously proposed
that different side-chain orientations of Tyr131 play an
important role in the interactions between these subdomains and furthermore
could also affect the flexibility of the β2−α2
loop region.36,55 In this way, the region from
the residues Ala123 to Tyr131 could additionally
stabilize the mdPrP structure through its interactions with the antiparallel
β-sheet and α2 helix and in this way prevent PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion.

The β2−α2
loop of mdPrP comprising residues 168–178 is well-defined,
composed of 310-helix, and stabilized with aromatic and
hydrophobic interactions with the nearby residues. The backbone orientations
of β2−α2 loops of the three examined structures
are similar, whereas small differences are notable in the side-chain
orientations of Val169 and Asp170 (Figure 5B). Moreover, different
orientations of glutamine and asparagine side chains in the β2−α2
loops (residues Gln171, Asn173, Asn174, and Asn176) are observed and might be related to the
long-range interactions and orientations of the aromatic moiety of
Tyr131 in the three compared structures (Figure S3). The structural features of β2−α2
loop have been extensively discussed in the literature.22,56−60 The presence
of Asn/Gln residues in the β2−α2 loop can be a
strong determinant for prion conversion that overrides the differences
in the sequence and has influence on the appearance of prions according
to the zipper model between the cervid and human PrP.22 Moreover, insertion of additional Gln residues into the
β2−α2 loop of mouse PrP promotes prion protein
conversion,61−63 whereas
several substitutions (at positions 169, 171, 173, and 177; residues
numbering based on the mdPrP sequence) in the β2−α2
loop of PrPC are believed to prevent the spontaneous prion
formation by influencing the structural stability of the β2−α2
loop.56−59,64

Additionally,
the structures and interactions of side chains in the β2−α2
loops are influenced by the orientations of side chains in the C-terminus
of the α3 helix including the residue at position 226. The α3
helix of wtdPrP is shorter and ends with Ser225, possibly
because of the shorter amino acid sequence36 with respect to the mdPrP structure. The C-terminus of ePrP protein
is unstructured after Tyr228 (Figure 5B). Tyr228 and Tyr229 have different side-chain orientations in mdPrP in comparison to
the ePrP structure, as a result of their distinct relative orientation,
that lead to hydrophobic interactions with the residues Val169, Asp170, and Ser225 and additionally stabilize
the end of the C-terminus part in mdPrP (Figure 5B and Table S2). Tyr228 of the wtdPrP structure is involved in stacking
interactions with Asp170 in the β2−α2
loop. However, the interactions between the residues at the end of
the α3 helix and Gln226 are not observed in wtdPrP,
resulting in higher solvent accessibility of Ser225 and
Gln226 in comparison to mdPrP and ePrP (Figures 5B and S3). Importantly, beside the polymorphism Q226E, mule deer
exhibits serine-to-asparagine polymorphism at position 138, which
is processed as a pseudogene,69,70 and serine-to-phenylalanine
polymorphism at codon 225.30 Allele Phe225 in mule deer could contribute to CWD resistance in view
of the reported prolonged incubation period with respect to the Ser225 mule deer homozygote.30 Interestingly,
it has been shown that polymorphisms at residues 225 and 226 affect
the interactions between the β2−α2 loop and α3
helix and therefore prion propagation within deer and elk.40,71 Our results showed that Ser225 is protected from solvents
as it is involved in the interaction with Tyr228 in mdPrP.
Additionally, Tyr228 in mdPrP is protected from solvents
by the stacking interaction with Val169. These data contribute
to the understanding at the molecular level and are in agreement with
the structural and molecular dynamics studies of inter- and intraspecies
PrP transmission related to cervids that pointed out a critical role
of residues 225 and 226 in PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion
and strain propagation.40

In the
three structures, α2 and α3 helices form a V-shaped skeleton
that slightly differs in the spatial orientation of the helices. The
interhelical angle between the α2 and α3 helices of mdPrP
is 44.5°, whereas its value in wtdPrP and ePrP is 49.8 and 52.2°,
respectively. The hydrophobic and aromatic residues of α2 and
α3 helices have preserved architectures that are stabilized
by a disulfide bond in the three structures. However, significant
differences are observed for the side-chain orientations of His190 and Thr194 in the α2 helix and Ile206, Met209, and Glu210 in the α3
helix (Figures 5C and S1). These residues are spatially close to the
loop that connects α2 and α3 helices. Surprisingly, the
α2−α3 loop of mdPrP exhibits a unique backbone
conformation with different orientations of the side chains of Glu199, Asn200, and Phe201 with respect
to wtdPrP and ePrP. However, the hydrophobic interactions of Phe201 and Tyr160 are preserved in the three structures.
Major differences are observed for distances Tyr160Cα–Val201Cβ and Glu199Cβ–Phe201Cζ that are up to 2 Å longer in mdPrP with respect to wtdPrP and
ePrP (Table 2). The
opposite is observed for distances Thr194Cγ2–Asn200Cβ, Asn200Cβ–Phe201Cζ, and Ile206Cγ2–Met209Cγ that are shorter in mdPrP with respect to the other two cervid structures
(Figure 5C and Table 2). The residue Glu199 is more exposed to the solvents, whereas residue Asn200 is less solvent-exposed in mdPrP in comparison to wtdPrP
and ePrP (Figure 7).
Different side-chain orientations in the α2−α3
loop could influence the interactions of residues in helices that
are spatially close to this region. In early events of oligomerization,
it is believed that the α1 helix moves away from the α2−α3
V-shaped skeleton. This is responsible for
the increased local structural dynamics that is reflected in greater
exposure of the amide hydrogen atoms in the α1 helix of mouse
PrP.65−68 Importantly, the stabilization of interactions or
covalent linkage by a disulfide bond between the subdomains β1−α1−β2
and α2−α3 is supposed to prevent the oligomerization.65

Figure 7 Solvent accessibility of selected residues that belong
to the α2 and α3 helices. Hatched and dotted lines at
20 and 50% indicate the limits of amino acid residue accessibility
to solvents (>50%) or burial in solvent-inaccessible regions (<20%).
Standard deviations are reported for the ensemble of 20 lowest energy
structures of mdPrP and ePrP that have been determined by NMR.

b Letters specify the position of distances
in Figure 5C.

Structure variations were also observed
in the orientations of the three helices and at the end of the α1
helix and its interactions with the α2−α3 loop.
The aromatic interactions between Tyr148 and Tyr152 differ among the three structures (Figure 5D). Furthermore, 2 times shorter distances
of Tyr148 with Thr202 and Thr204 are
observed in mdPrP and ePrP structures compared to wtdPrP (Table S2). A similar trend in distances was observed
between Tyr152 and Thr202. In contrast, the
distances between Tyr152 and Thr204 are similar
for all the three structures. Thr202 and Thr204 are more solvent-exposed in the ePrP structure with respect to mdPrP
and wtdPrP structures (Figure 7). We observed a closer anchoring of the α1 helix to
α2 and α3 helices in the mdPrP structure with respect
to ePrP and wtdPrP.

Effect of Polymorphism Q226E on Electrostatic Surface Potential
MdPrP, wtdPrP, and ePrP are known for their polymorphisms at positions
138 and 226. S138N and Q226E polymorphisms have a major impact on
the electrostatic surface potential of the examined structures (Figure 8).

and negative charges are depicted from blue to red according to the
presented charge legend. Orientation of structures is preserved in
all panels. The lower set of structures is rotated by 135°.

Our results
show that variations in the electrostatic surface potential among
the three proteins are mostly clustered at the β1−α1
loop, at the beginning of the α2 helix, at the V-shaped skeleton
where the antiparallel β sheet is in proximity to the α2
and α3 helices, and at the C-terminus of the α3 helix
(Figure 8).

In
contrast to the wtdPrP and ePrP structures, a large contiguous area
of positive electrostatic potential is observed on the surface of
the mdPrP structure. The region around residue 138 is positively charged
in mdPrP, whereas the corresponding region in wtdPrP and ePrP proteins
is neutral. Additional variations of positive charge in the mdPrP
and wtdPrP structures to a predominantly neutral state in the ePrP
structure are observed in the middle of α2 and α3 helices.
Polymorphism Q226E is reflected in the charge of preferentially positive
surface areas in the β2−α2 loop and the C-terminus
of the α3-helix in mdPrP and wtdPrP in comparison to the negative
electrostatic potential in ePrP. However, the C-terminus of wtdPrP
is negatively charged to mdPrP and ePrP. Residues 225 and 226 are
located in a distal region of the α3 helix that participates
in interactions with the β2−α2 loop to form a solvent-accessible
contiguous epitope.72 Our data suggest
that different distributions of electrostatic potential between mdPrP
and ePrP proteins may facilitate intramolecular interactions between
two allelic variants in deer subspecies in case of S225F and Q226E
polymorphisms and influence the early stages of prion conversion and
neuropathology of CWD among cervids.

Conclusions
The spread of CWD in North America and
the most recent cases of CWD-infected cervid subspecies in Europe
have raised concerns for public health and perceived risks for possible
CWD transmission to humans through the consumption of CWD-infected
venison.8,51−53 The possible spontaneous spread of the disease among
cervid subspecies in Eurasia represents a global threat.54 Structural studies on mdPrP at the molecular
level are important for understanding the still unknown reasons for
the appearance of the detected and confirmed cases of CWD in captive
mule deer3 and the progressive spread and
identification of the disease in other cervids.

Previous findings
suggest that the primary structural differences at residue 226 identify
biologically distinct prion strains on the basis of different disease
progressions in deer and elk33 and have
a role in dictating the selection of different CWD prion strains in
gene-targeted mice.35 These findings suggest
that the observed differences are related to an altered structure
of PrPC caused by the Q226E polymorphism, highlighting
the importance of amino acid sequence variations affecting the local
changes of 3D structures, whereas the globular fold remains similar.
A detailed comparative structural analysis of the examined PrP of
cervids could provide insights into pathogenesis suggesting that the
structures of deer and elk prion proteins may determine prion strain
mutation in these cervids.

Our comparative analysis uncovered
the structural determinants of mdPrP that are manifested in diverse
structural rearrangements and distinct electrostatic surface potentials
with respect to the wtdPrP and ePrP structures. The region at the
beginning of the C-terminus domain could protect the β-sheet
from solvents, force the closer packing of β1−α1−β2
to α2−α3 subdomains and raise the structural stability
of mdPrP. These structural features could have a major effect on the
prion conversion. In our previous studies, we have found that amino
acid substitution at position 226 has dramatic effects on CWD prion
replication, pathogenesis, and biochemical properties.73 Tg(DeerPrP) has a longer incubation time compared
with Tg(ElkPrP) mice after inoculation with CWD prions. On the other
hand, Tg(DeerPrP) mice were susceptible to SSBP/1,74 whereas Tg(ElkPrP) mice were completely resistant.71 In addition, Q226 CWD prions display more resistance
to guanidine denaturation than the E226 CWD prions.35 Our current findings suggest that the long-range interactions
in the mdPrP protein might stabilize the overall structure, thus impacting
the PrPC-to-PrPSc conversion. The distribution
of electrostatic surface potential on the mdPrP protein may lead to
different intermolecular interactions between PrPC and
PrPSc and in this way may represent a step toward understanding
the underlining mechanism of CWD prion transmission.

Methods
Plasmid Construction for NMR Sample Preparation
The
recombinant dePrP (94–233) was obtained using the QuikChange
kit (Stratagene) utilizing primers 5′-CAGAGAGAATCCCAGGCTTATTACCAAAGA-3′
and 5′-TCTTTGGTAATAAGCCTGGGATTCTCTCTG-3′ and ePrP(94–234)
as templates. The DNA product was then inserted into pProExHTa (Invitrogen),
containing the cleavage site between the His6 tag and the
protein fragment. The cloned DNA sequences were verified by sequencing.

Prion Protein Expression and Purification
A freshly
transformed overnight culture of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene) was added at 37 °C to 2 L of
the minimal medium plus ampicillin (100 mg/mL). For isotope labeling,
4 g/L [13C6] glucose and 1 g/L [15N] ammonium chloride were added. At 0.8 OD600, expression
was induced with isopropyl β-d-galactopyranoside to
a final concentration of 0.8 mM. Cells were grown in a Biostat B plus
2 L vessel (Sartorius) and harvested 18 h after inoculation. The bacterial
paste was resuspended in 25 mM Tris-HCl, 0.8% Triton X-100, and 1
mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0, and lysed
by a Panda homogenizer. A crude extract was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap
column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in a binding buffer [2 M GndHCl,
500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, and 20 mM imidazole (pH 8.0)] and eluted
with 500 mM imidazole. The purified protein was lyophilized and dissolved
in 8 M GndHCl. The protein was diluted to a final concentration of
0.5 mg/mL in a tobacco etch virus (TEV) reaction buffer (50 mM Tris
base, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and 5 mM dithiothreitol),
and TEV protease was added to the final concentration of 75 μg/mL.
The reaction was incubated at 22 °C overnight. The cleaved sample
was loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated
with a binding buffer [500 mM NaCl and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)], and
the flow-through containing only the cleaved protein was collected.
The purified protein was lyophilized and redissolved in 8 M GndHCl.
Refolding was performed by dialysis against a refolding buffer [20
mM sodium acetate and 0.005% NaN3 (pH 5.5)] using a Spectra/Por
membrane (molecular weight, 3000). The purified protein was analyzed
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under
reducing conditions, western blot, and electrospray mass spectrometry.
The purification and expression of TEV protease were obtained as described
earlier.75

NMR Spectroscopy and Structure Calculation
All NMR
experiments used for structure determination were performed on a 13C, 15N isotopically labeled mdPrP sample on a
Varian VNMRS 800 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple 1H/13C/15N resonance cryogenic probe head operating
at 25 K with inverse detection. The sample temperature was calibrated
using the methanol-d3 standard sample
to ensure consistent sample temperature. The sample temperature for
all experiments was 298 K. The sample contained 0.48 mM of mdPrP in
a 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 5.5. NMR experiments for NH and
HC detection were performed in 90%/10% H2O/D2O and in a 100% deuterated buffer, respectively. The sequence-specific
assignment of the backbone 1H, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13CO resonances for mdPrP was obtained using the 15N-HSQC
spectrum and triple-resonance NMR experiments HNCO, HN(CO)CA, HNCA,
CBCA(CO)NH, and HNCACB.41 The 1H and 13C resonances of aliphatic and aromatic side chains
were assigned using 13C-HSQC in combination with HAHB(CO)NH,
CC(CO)NH, (H)CCH-TOCSY, and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments.42 NOE contacts were determined in 3D 15N and 13C-edited NOESY-HSQC experiments. Structure modeling
of mdPrP was performed using the program CYANA 3.1.76 Structure refinement using the explicit solvent model was
performed by the YASARA program.77 An ensemble
of 20 lowest energy structures of mdPrP was validated by the web server
software ICING44 and PSVS.45

Backbone amide relaxation measurements including 15N longitudinal (R1), transverse
(R2), rotating frame (R1ρ) relaxation rates, and {1H}–15N heteronuclear NOE were obtained at two different magnetic
fields (14.1 and 18.8 T) at 298 K.78 Residues
Gln95, Thr98, Ser100, Asn103, Ser106, Met137, His143, Tyr165, Asp170, Gln171, Asn174, Asn176, His180, Cys182, Val187, Met216, and Ile218 could not be
analyzed because of the cross-peak overlap.

All recorded spectra
were processed with NMRPipe software79 and
analyzed with CARA80 and SPARKY software.81 The prediction of backbone dihedral angles was
made by the TALOS+ program.82 Alignment
was prepared using ClustalO.83 An analysis
was performed by the web server GETAREA.49,50 The
potentials were calculated at an experimental pH of 5.5 of mdPrP using
PDB2PQR server,84 APBS,85 and PROPKA.86,87
