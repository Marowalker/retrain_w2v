Sensitizing titania
with semiconducting quantum dots (QDs) is an
important field for the development of third-generation photovoltaics.
Many methods have been developed to effectively incorporate QDs over
the surface of mesoporous titania, assembled from the 20–25
nm titania nanoparticles. Here, we introduce a molten-salt-assisted
self-assembly (MASA) method to fabricate CdSe-modified mesoporous
titania photoanodes. A mixture of ethanol, two surfactants (cetyltrimethylammonium
bromide and 10-lauryl ether), silica (tetramethyl orthosilicate) or
titania source (Ti(OC4H9)4, acid
(HNO3), and cadmium nitrate solution was infiltrated into
the pores of mesoporous titania (assembled using Degussa 25, P25)
and immediately calcined at 450 °C to obtain mesoporous cadmium
oxide–silica–titania (meso-CdO–SiO2–P25) or cadmium titanate–titania (meso-CdTiO3–P25) films. The MASA process is a simple method to smoothly
coat or fill the pores of titania with mesoporous CdO–SiO2 or CdTiO3 that can be reacted under an H2Se atmosphere to convert cadmium species to CdSe at 100 °C.
Etching of the silica films with a very dilute hydrogen fluoride solution
produces mesoporous CdSe–titania (meso-CdSe–P25) electrodes.
The method is flexible to adjust the CdSe/TiO2 mole ratio
over a very broad range in the films. The films were characterized
at every stage of the preparation to demonstrate the effectiveness
of the method. The electrodes were also tested in a simple two-electrode
solar cell to demonstrate the performance of the electrodes that have
a power conversion efficiency of 3.35%.

Introduction
The third-generation
photovoltaic cells consisting of hybrid materials
used for harvesting solar energy are a current topic of interest in
the literature with a focus on meeting future energy demands.1−3 Quantum-dot-sensitized solar cells (QDSSCs) that consist of two
different semiconductor nanoparticles are one of the promising low-cost
next-generation solar cells.1−20 These cells consist of three components: the photoanode–electrode
(quantum nanoparticles, such as CdS-, CdSe-, CdTe-, and PbS-sensitized
mesoporous TiO2), an electrolyte (S2–/Sn2–),12−14 and a counter electrode (CE) (usually Cu2S nanoparticles
formed over the brass plates). However, the power conversion efficiency
of QDSSCs is around 4–5%, which is low compared to that of
dye-sensitized solar cells.21−24 The reasons for the lower power conversion efficiencies
include slow hole-transfer rate, back electron transfer to electrolyte,
low fill factors (FFs) due to poor CE performance, limited absorption
of the incident light, and so forth. Some of these issues may be addressed
by properly designing the active electrode materials, sensitizer–titania,
by using new synthetic approaches.

Several methods have been
developed for the modification of titania
by QDs, including in situ growth of quantum particles (QPs) by chemical
bath deposition (CBD)6 or successive ionic
layer adsorption and reaction (SILAR),7 inclusion of presynthesized QPs into the mesoscopic titania film
by direct adsorption (DA),8 electrophoretic
deposition (EPD),9 or using organic linkers.10 In the CBD and SILAR methods, the surface coverage
of the titania nanoparticles is high compared to other methods. High
coverage reduces the back electron transfer to the electrolyte. However,
the synthesis of quantum nanoparticles (QPs) in a confined space (mesopores
of titania films) has limitations on controlling the morphology and
size of the QPs. Preparation of a decent solar-light-absorbing photoanode
requires multiple loading/selenium reaction steps. During these steps,
it is likely to block the mesopores that may cause a poor QP–electrolyte
(redox couple) contact. The inclusion of presynthesized QPs into the
mesoscopic titania film is a time-consuming process and results in
a nonuniform distribution of QPs over the titania particles. Usually,
the major problem with this method is the inhomogeneous distribution
of the QPs, with most being located on the solution side of the electrodes
and almost none on the back of the electrode, which is the most important
part of the electrode for harvesting light. The back side of the electrode
has the first and most effective contact with the incoming light for
the efficient conversion of light to electrical energy. EPD has also
been adopted to improve the uptake of the QPs into the mesoscopic
titania film. On the other hand, the surface coverage of the QPs in
the DA, EPD, and organic linker is less than that of the CBD and SILAR
methods.

Recently, we have developed a new self-assembly process
(molten-salt-assisted
self-assembly, MASA) that uses metal salts as a nonvolatile solvent
and metal-ion source to incorporate a desired amount of metal oxide
into mesoporous silica and metal titanate.25−27 The method
is similar to evaporation-induced self-assembly,28 where the solvent evaporates during the process, and the
nonvolatile salt species and hydrolyzing/polymerizing species assemble
into mesostructures as thin films, which can be calcined into mesoporous
thin films. Moreover, in the MASA approach, the metal salt has dual
properties: it remains as a secondary solvent to assemble hydrolyzing/polymerizing
species into mesostructures by remaining a liquid between the surfactant
and solidified pore walls, and later, upon calcination, it can be
deposited as a thin layer of metal oxide over the silica wall or as
a metal titanate pore wall. This is a very effective way of incorporating
metal ions into the mesopores as a reactive metal oxide with a very
high density, over a 100% metal oxide/silica mole ratio.26 The MASA process also eliminates the formation
of acids of the counter anion (usually nitrate or chloride) of the
salt, used as a metal-ion source, in the H2S or H2Se reactions to convert the metal ions into metal sulfide or metal
selenide QPs.29

Here, we introduce
a new method of modifying mesoporous titania
with QPs, which can be synthesized inside mesopores. The 20–25
nm titania particles (Degussa 25, P25) are first dispersed into ethanol
and coated over a glass or fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate.
The ingredients of the silica–metal oxide or metal titanate
precursors are then spin-coated over this film, which can be calcined
to obtain mesoporous silica–cadmium oxide or metal titanate
incorporated into the mesoporous titania films. Exposing these films
to an H2Se atmosphere produces CdSe-sensitized mesoporous
films.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of the meso-CdO–SiO2–P25
and meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 Films
The
titania (P25) film (meso-P25) that provides mesopores (5–50
nm) for the infiltration of the silica precursor solution was prepared
as described in the Experimental Section.
Then, a clear ethanol solution of cadmium nitrate tetrahydrate ([Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2), tetramethyl
orthosilicate (TMOS), 10-lauryl ether (C12E10), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and nitric acid is infiltrated
into the pores by dropping, followed by spin coating to remove any
unfiltered solution from the top of the film. It is also likely that
upon evaporation of the volatile solvent (ethanol) and further condensation
of the silica species, its volume shrinks and causes further sucking
of this upper gel-like layer into the pores through capillary forces.
Therefore, under certain conditions, there is no CdO–SiO2 film formation over the meso-P25 films upon calcination.
The infiltrated solution slowly goes into the gel phase and then solidifies
over time (see ref (22) for details) in the mesopores, Scheme 1. The calcination of this film produces a
CdO–silica-filled mesoporous titania, denoted as meso-CdO–SiO2–P25.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of Step 1, Loading
of meso-P25 with Silica–Cd(II)
Precursors, Followed by Calcination to Obtain meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 and Step 2, upon H2Se Reaction
The Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) spectra of the calcined samples
display peak(s) because of υ-Si–O–Cd stretching
mode at around 990 cm–1, as shown in Figure 1a. No CdSiO3 formation
was observed in the samples, indicating that the silica species are
acting as a blocking layer (see later in the titania system) over
the titania surface; infrared spectra of CdSiO3 display
sharp characteristic peaks at 603, 707, 834, and 929 cm–1.26,30 Also, 29Si MAS-NMR spectra, in Figure 1b, support the above-proposed
structure that one can observe Q4 sites (Si(OSi)4, at −115 ppm) and Si(OSi)4–x(OCd)x sites (where x is 1 and 2, observed at −96 and −83 ppm, respectively).31 The reaction between the meso-CdO–SiO2 and H2Se produces CdSe–SiO2 over
the surface of P25. Both FTIR and 29Si MAS-NMR spectra
display only pure silica-related peaks (peak at 1082 and shoulder
at 1190 cm–1) in the FTIR spectra and Q2, Q3, and Q4 peaks31 in the 29Si MAS-NMR spectra; the Q2 and Q3 sites form upon the reaction of H2Se with the
Si(OSi)3(OCd) and Si(OSi)2(OCd)2 interfaces,
respectively, see Figure 1b, indicating that all Cd(II) species are reacted to form
CdSe. This is an important observation in understanding the formation
process. Figures 1c
and S1 show the FTIR spectra of the sample
upon a consecutive loading and loading using different amounts of
ethanol solutions, respectively. However, both sets of samples have
very similar spectral changes with increasing loading (multiple loading
is a consecutive process of loading/calcination) or single loading
using less viscous ethanol solution (the same ingredient composition
in 1, 3, 5, and 10 mL of ethanol). Gradual increase of the υ-Si–O–Cd
peak at 990 cm–1 shows that loading is quantitative
and can be controlled either by multiple loading or by using concentrated
MASA solutions (see Figures 1 and S1). Further analysis is needed
to differentiate between these two sets of samples because the samples
display very low solar efficiency upon loading using less viscous
solutions; on the other hand, multiple loading enhances the efficiency
(see later).

and (c) FTIR spectra of meso-CdO–SiO2–P25
with different number of coatings.

To elucidate the nature of meso-CdO–SiO2 over
the surface of meso-P25, the samples prepared using 1, 3, 5, and 10
mL of ethanol solutions were investigated using the scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) imaging, sorption, and spectroscopic techniques. Figure 2 shows a set of SEM
images displaying a thin layer of meso-CdO–SiO2 formation,
when the ethanol amount in the clear solution is less than 3 mL. However,
the meso-CdO–SiO2 film over the electrode surface
diminishes with an increasing ethanol amount in the precursor mixture
and completely disappears at around 5 mL of ethanol (see Figure 2). Also note that
the ethanol amount is relative, and if one doubles the ingredients
(salt and surfactant species) in the solution, the ethanol amount
should be doubled to get a similar viscosity. Both solutions prepared
using 1 and 3 mL of ethanol show meso-CdO–SiO2 film
layers over the titania films (meso-P25), as marked on the images
(Figure 2). However,
when the ethanol amount is increased to 5 mL and above, no meso-CdO–SiO2 film formation was observed over the electrodes. However,
infiltration of the dilute solutions results a low CdO–SiO2 loading; therefore, it may be necessary to load the films
multiple times to reach to a desired sensitizer concentration.

Figure 2 SEM images
of the meso-CdO–SiO2–P25, prepared
using solutions with different amounts of ethanol (1, 3, and 5 mL
of ethanol single coatings) and four-layer coating (4L) using the
solution prepared in 5 mL of ethanol, as marked over the images.

Notice also that the evaporation
of ethanol from the coated mixture
leaves the nonvolatile species, as a gel, in the mesopores of meso-P25;
therefore, the salt/silica and salt/surfactant mole ratios are preserved;
the only difference among the samples, prepared using different amounts
of ethanol, is the total amount of gel formed upon the evaporation
of ethanol in and over the titania films. There is a distinct morphology
difference among the electrodes that have meso-CdO–SiO2 film coverage; the formation of a meso-CdO–SiO2 film over the electrode surface is detrimental for the solar
cell performance due to no solar performance of the meso-CdSe–SiO2 film. Only meso-CdO–SiO2 species, useful
in solar cell activity, are the ones in the pores of meso-P25, where
the titania nanoparticles are uniformly coated with a very thin layer
of CdO–SiO2. We also checked the SEM images of the
samples, prepared using dilute precursor solutions over multiple steps
(see Figure S2). Each loading step involves
infiltration followed by calcination at 450 °C for 1 h. The samples
loaded two, three, and four times were analyzed, and after four times
loading, meso-CdO–SiO2 film layers over the titania
films were observed (see Figure S2). One
can make multiple loading for a desired amount of meso-CdO–SiO2 coating over the titania particles without any film formation.
We also collected energy-dispersive system (EDS) data along the thickness
axis of two different samples, loaded using 1 and 5 mL of ethanol
solutions and calcined at 450 °C, to show the homogeneous coating
of the internal surface of the meso-P25 film. Figure S3 shows the cross-sectional SEM images and the elemental
(Si, Cd, and Ti) analysis along the cross section (line scan along
the thickness axis of the films). The film formation over the meso-P25
film is clearly visible in both SEM image and EDS data (Figure S3) in the case of 1 mL of ethanol. The
meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 film, obtained from 5 mL
of ethanol solutions, contains homogeneous elemental (Si, Cd, and
Ti) distribution throughout the film.

The N2 sorption
isotherms of the films show type IV
isotherms with a hysteresis, showing that they are all mesoporous
before and after loading (see Figure 3). The samples, loaded using concentrated solutions
(1–3 mL of ethanol) or four times loaded using dilute solutions
(in 5 mL of ethanol), display a much narrower pore size distribution
at around the 2–3 nm region in the pore size distribution plots
(Figure S4). Notice that the smaller pores,
due to the meso-CdO–SiO2 film layer, increase with
increased loading. However, the samples prepared using dilute solutions
and multiple loadings display a gradual diminishing of the pores in
the titania film domains without smaller pores (see isotherms and
pore size distribution plots in Figure S4) also indicating no film formation over the meso-P25 film.

Barrett–Joyner–Halenda pore size distribution plot of
TiO2 nanoparticles before loading with ethanol (black line),
loading with less ethanol (red line), and four times loading with
ethanol (blue line).

We also collected the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of
the above
samples and observed that the CdO–SiO2 domains are
mesoporous with low or no crystallinity (see Figure 4). The broad feature at around 30°,
2θ, gradually increases with reducing ethanol in the clear solution
and with multiple coatings. This feature arises from the (110) and
(111) planes of the ultrathin CdO (around 1.6 nm) layer over the silica
(see ref (26) for details).
The sharp lines originated from P25 titania32 nanoparticles, consisting of 80% anatase and 20% rutile phase. However,
upon reaction under an H2Se gas, stronger and broad lines
due to (111), (220), and (311) planes of the nanocrystalline zinc-blended
CdSe appear at 25.4°, 41.9°, and 49.5°, 2θ, respectively.33 The CdSe nanoparticles are on average 3–4
nm, calculated using the Scherrer equation. Notice also that with
decreasing ethanol, the only change is in the intensity of the CdSe
diffraction lines that gradually increases with a decreasing ethanol
amount in the original solution. Therefore, it can be concluded that
the CdSe nanoparticles in pores (meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25)
and in the meso-CdSe–SiO2 film over titania have
a similar origin. Figure 4 also shows the XRD pattern of meso-CdSe–SiO2 for comparison purpose and meso-P25 as a reference.

Figure 4 XRD pattern of meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 prepared
using different amounts of ethanol solutions (a) before H2Se reaction and (b) after H2Se reaction (indexes correspond
to the CdSe nanoparticles). Samples were prepared from (I) 1, (II)
2.5, (III) 5, (IV) 10 mL of ethanol solutions, (V) meso-P25, and (VI)
meso-CdSe–SiO2 film.

The meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 and meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 films were further analyzed using transmittance
electron microscopy (TEM) imaging. Figures 5 and S5 display
the TEM images of meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 and meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 films. Clearly, one can distinguish both mesoporous
CdO–SiO2 domains over the spherical nanocrystalline
titania (P25) and 3–4 nm CdSe nanocrystals (consistent with
the XRD and N2 sorption data) in the films before and after
H2Se reaction, respectively. A detailed analysis of the
high-resolution TEM image of meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25
by fast Fourier transform (FFT) and inverse FFT of the selected area
reveals lattice fringes with a spacing of around 0.352 nm that originate
from the (111) plane of the CdSe particle (see Figure 5). From the high-resolution image, the distinguished
specific lattice planes of the titania, cadmium oxide, and cadmium
selenide accord with the results, obtained from the XRD data.

Synthesis of meso-CdTiO3–P25 and meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25
Films
The MASA process has also been
employed to coat the films of the titania nanoparticle (meso-P25)
by CdTiO3, by replacing the silica source with a titania
source. The clear solution that contains two surfactants (C12EO10 and CTAB), two solvents (ethanol and [Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2), acid, and titanium
tetrabutoxide is infiltered into the pores of a prefabricated titania
film and calcined immediately at 450 °C to convert the precursors
into mesoporous CdTiO3.25 The
H2Se reaction of meso-CdTiO3 has produced CdSe
and TiO2 nanoparticles over the films of titania (P25)
nanoparticles.25 Because the CdTiO3-coated meso-P25 (meso-CdTiO3–P25) produces
bared TiO2 upon reaction under an H2Se atmosphere,
it is important to control the reaction atmosphere.25 In the presence of oxygen/water, a bared titania surface
promotes Se(0) formation and results a dark red color (due to Se particles),
which may be misleading. The selenium formation can be monitored using
Raman spectroscopy. The Raman spectra (Figure 6) display a peak at 250 cm–1 because of the Se metal,34 in addition
to a peak at around 200 cm–1 and its overtone at
around 400 cm–1 (overlap with the titania peak)
because of CdSe nanoparticles.35 The other
intense peaks at 150, 196, 393, 511, and 632 cm–1 are due to the anatase phase of titania (P25 particles).36 Also notice that the CdSe signals are much more
intense in the silica samples, compared to those in the titania samples,
indicating a lower reactivity of CdTiO3. However, the reactions
carried under vacuum conditions or N2 atmosphere reduce
the selenium formation to below the Raman detection limits.

and (b) meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25 over laser exposure
time and intensity ratio of (c) (CdSe)t/(CdSe)0 and (d) (CdSe)t/TiO2 over time.

Moreover, the H2Se reaction of meso-CdTiO3–P25 is less reactive
compared to that of meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 samples.
To demonstrate this, we also prepared
thin films of both meso-CdO–SiO2 and meso-CdTiO3 without P25 nanoparticles, and both reactions were monitored
using Raman spectroscopy. The CdSe signals are much more intense in
the silica samples without a selenium signal (Figure 6a,b). For a complete reaction between meso-CdTiO3 and H2Se, the samples must be kept under an H2Se atmosphere at higher temperatures and longer durations,
which may cause other problems. The presence of air in the H2Se reaction media enhances the selenium formation in the meso-CdTiO3–P25 system. To elucidate the origin of the side reaction,
the H2Se reaction over a Cd(II) free sample (bared titania
film) was also carried out, and it was discovered that the only product
is Se(0) (Figure S6). Therefore, it is
reasonable to conclude that the bared titania surface promotes the
Se(0) formation through converting O2 to water. Also note
that the meso-CdTiO3 produces bared titania25 and water during the H2Se reaction
as side products and therefore promotes the Se(0) formation. However,
the Se(0) species can be effectively removed by washing the samples
using a Na2S solution before or during solar cell measurements,
where the solar cell measurements are carried out using a Na2S/S8 solution and also by sublimation under vacuum at
around 200 °C.

Response of meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 and
meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25 Samples to Green Laser
and Solar Cell Performance
We discovered that the final products
are very sensitive to green laser exposure under the Raman spectroscopy;
both meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 and meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25 samples undergo slow decomposition that can be
monitored using the CdSe Raman signal. Both silica and titania samples,
coated over an FTO substrate or any conducting substrate, give the
same response. However, the decomposition is not observed if the substrate
is a nonconducting material such as glass. This behavior is important
to demonstrate the response of the photoanode (meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 and meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25)
to the light. The excited CdSe loses its electrons to titania and
then to the conducting substrate; therefore, it undergoes oxidation
and as a result decomposition. The decomposition product is currently
unknown, but the CdSe Raman signal at around 200 cm–1 decays over time and does not recover upon removing the laser beam,
indicating an irreversible process (see Figure 6). The Raman intensity of both samples was
normalized to titania signal36 at around
150 cm–1 to evaluate both the decay behavior and
the relative amount of CdSe produced in both silica and titania samples. Figure 6c,d shows the normalized
decay plots of intensity ratios of I(CdSe)t/I(CdSe)0 (t any time, 0 at time zero) and I(CdSe)t/I(TiO2) over time. Both
meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 and meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25 show similar decay curves, but the normalized
decay curves show that the silica sample decays more quickly. This
indicates that the silica layer over the titania does not affect the
electron flow from the excited CdSe to titania through a silica layer.
Note also that the CdSe nanoparticles are flakelike in the silica26 and spherical in the titania25 systems. Therefore, the fast decay may be due to the amount
of CdSe and its flakelike morphology in the silica system.

To
measure the solar performances of both types of anode electrodes,
the QDSSC was assembled by sandwiching a standard S2–/S8 electrolyte between the anode constructed as described
above and the Cu2S cathode electrode, produced by activating
the brass plate in acid and Na2S solution. Typical I–V curves under 1 sun condition
of silica-based cells are shown in Figure 7, and the cell characteristics of the electrodes
fabricated under different preparation conditions are tabulated in Table 1. Most investigations
have been carried out using thin photoanodes that are prepared by
coating a dispersed slurry of P25 in excess ethanol. This ensures
to produce uniform and thin films (typical film thickness of 1 μm)
with relatively lower cell efficiencies. However, when increasing
the meso-P25 film thickness using the doctor blade method, the efficiencies
of the cells could be increased. We have found out that both silica-
and titania-based anodes show similar cell characteristics with a
percent FF of 50–60 and open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 0.5–0.6 V. However, the maximum efficiency
was detected from the silica samples with a % FF of 60 and Voc of 0.6 V, and a short current (Jsc) of 10 mA has been recorded using relatively thicker
films with a double loading. Further treatments, such as removing
silica layer by dilute hydrogen fluoride (HF), can effectively remove
silica,26 but the resulting sample does
not have a better solar cell performance. It is likely that removing
the silica layer between the titania domains and CdSe nanoparticles
breaks the contact between the titania and the sensitizers and creates
more bared titania surfaces. Therefore, further treatments are necessary
to overcome the damage of HF treatment to improve the cell performance.

The efficiencies of the cells can be further optimized by introducing
Mn(II) into the CdSe sensitizer using the MASA process. The MASA process
is a quite flexible method to introduce Mn(II) and other metals into
the media that may also boost the solar performance of the cells.10 We observed that the cell performance can be
improved by 40% upon modifying the samples by introducing about 13%
Mn(II) into the CdTiO3 samples (see Table 1). However, the improvement in the silica
samples was limited to around 13% for the same Mn(II)/Cd(II) ratio.
Note that the oxides in the titania systems are metal titanates,25,27 in which both CdTiO3 and MnTiO3 form the same
structure; therefore, the titania system is likely to form a solid
solution of Cd1–xMnxTiO3, where the H2Se reaction
can effectively produce a solid solution of Cd1–xMnxSe as a sensitizer.
However, in the silica system, it is not possible to form Cd1–xMnxO because both oxides
have different crystal structures and do not form a solid solution.
Therefore, the H2Se reaction produces a solid solution
with smaller Mn(II)/Cd(II) ratio in the Cd1–xMnxSe nanoparticles, and the major
products are likely to be individual metal selenides, CdSe and MnSe.
As a result, the addition of Mn(II) in the titania system enhances
the cell performance more than that in the silica system. Even though,
this is the case, the Mn(II) produced through the MASA process improves
the solar cell performances of both systems and the cells produced
by our method should be further investigated by introducing current
improvements in the cathode side.

Conclusions
The
MASA process has been used for the assembly of the CdSe-sensitized
titania-based photoanode for QDSSCs. The process starts as a clear
solution of a polymerizing agent (silica, TMOS, or titania, Ti(OBu)4), surfactants (C12E10 and CTAB), acid,
and salt. The polymerizing agent ensures the formation of nano-CdO
or nano-CdTiO3 for the formation of nano-CdSe in the pores
of meso-P25 upon H2Se reaction. The MASA is an effective
process to uniformly coat the internal surface of the titania films
(prepared using P25) to produce meso-CdO–SiO2–P25
and meso-CdTiO3–P25 films that can be converted
into CdSe–SiO2–P25 and CdSe–TiO2–P25 under an N2/H2Se atmosphere.
The viscosity of the clear MASA solution has a critical importance
in the effective coating of the internal surface of the titania films;
with an incorrect viscosity, the process may instead produce a blocking
thin layer of mesoporous CdO–SiO2 or CdTiO3 over the titania film. The H2Se and meso-CdO–SiO2–P25 reaction is a complete and clean process, compared
to the same reaction of meso-CdTiO3–TiO2–P25.

A typical cell can be fabricated with a solar
cell efficiency of
around 3.3% but can be further improved by introducing Mn(II) into
the sensitizer. Incorporation of Mn(II) is more effective in the titania
system than the silica system because of the formation of a solid-solution-type
precursor in the titania system, rather than individual oxides of
Mn(II) and Cd(II) in silica. However, the cells, prepared using silica
and titania precursors, display similar solar cell performances; even
though silica is an insulating material, its high reactivity and morphology
difference provide a slightly better performance as an anode in the
solar cell. Further improvements can be achieved by further modifying
the anode by multiple coatings and doping. The MASA process, used
in this work, is a very flexible method and can be used to add different
metal impurities to the photoanode films and to the QDSSCs.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of Mesoporous Titania Films (meso-P25)
P25 (1.5 g, titania, Aldrich grade) was dispersed into a 5 mL of
ethanol by stirring, and then the mixture was sonicated for 30 min.
Titanium tetrabutoxide (Ti(BuO)4, 0.25 mL) and concentrated
nitric acid (0.5 g, 65%) were added into the dispersion and stirred
for another 5 min. Half of the FTO glass was isolated by using a scotch
tape. Then, the FTO glass was spin-coated using the above solution
at 2000 rpm. The tape was removed, and then the sample was calcined
at 450 °C for 15 min and was denoted as meso-P25.

The thicker
films were obtained by using a thicker dispersion. The dispersion
was prepared by using a paste: 0.2 g of P25 was mixed with 12 drops
of acetic acid, 0.6 mL of ethanol, 0.6 mL of water, and 1 drop of
Triton-100 in a mortar and grounded well until it becomes a paste.
Then, the paste was spread over half of the FTO glass, and then the
sample was annealed at 450 °C for 1 h and was denoted as meso-P25.

Synthesis of Mesoporous Cadmium Oxide–silica–titania
Films (meso-CdO–SiO2–P25)
C12EO10 (0.500 g, 0.8 mmol) and CTAB (0.291 g, 0.8
mmol) were dissolved in a 5 mL of ethanol (the same compositions were
also prepared in 1, 3, and 10 mL of ethanol). Then, [Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2 (1.970 g, 6.4 mmol) and
TMOS (0.85 g, 5.6 mmol) were added to the above solution, and the
solution was stirred for 5 min. The meso-P25 film was located over
the spin coater, and the above solution was put as drops (to ensure
that the solution is really soaked into the film) and was spin-coated
at 1000 rpm for 30 s. Immediately after spin coating, the film was
placed in an oven at 65 °C and the sample was calcined up to
450 °C with a 1°/min increments.

Synthesis of Mesoporous
Mn(II)-Doped Cadmium Oxide–Silica–Titania
Films
The above procedure was used for the synthesis of Mn(II)-doped
films with some modifications. [Mn(H2O)4](NO3)2 (0.21 g, 0.83 mmol) and [Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2 (1.715 g, 5.57 mmol) were used
as salts for 13% Mn(II) doping. For lower dopings, Mn(II) in the clear
solutions was reduced accordingly.

Synthesis of Mesoporous
Cadmium Titanate–Titania Films
(meso-CdTiO3–P25)
C12EO10 (0.500 g, 0.8 mmol) and CTAB (0.291 g, 0.8 mmol) were dissolved
in a 5 mL of ethanol. Then, [Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2 (1.970 g, 6.4 mmol) and Ti(BuO)4 (1.91
g, 5.6 mmol) were added to the above solution, and the solution was
stirred for 5 min. The meso-P25 film was located over the spin coater,
and the above solution was put as drops (to ensure that the solution
is really soaked into the film) and was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for
30 s. Immediately after spin coating, the film was placed in an oven
at 65 °C and the sample was calcined up to 450 °C with a
1°/min increments.

Synthesis of Mesoporous Mn(II)-Doped Cadmium
Titanate–Titania
Films
The above procedure was used for the synthesis of Mn(II)-doped
films with some modifications. [Mn(H2O)4](NO3)2 (0.21 g, 0.83 mmol) and [Cd(H2O)4](NO3)2 (1.715 g, 5.57 mmol) were used
as salts for 13% Mn(II) doping. For lower dopings, Mn(II) in the clear
solutions was reduced accordingly.

Synthesis of Mesoporous
Cadmium Selenide–Silica–Titania
(meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25) Films and Mesoporous
Cadmium Selenide–Titania (meso-CdSe–TiO2–P25)
Films
The calcined meso-CdO–SiO2–P25
or meso-CdTiO3–P25 was inserted into a vacuum chamber
designed for an H2Se reaction, and the chamber was evacuated
for a few minutes before exposing the sample to the H2Se
atmosphere. About 100 Torr of H2Se was added, and the reaction
was carried out for 30 min at 100 °C. The chamber was evacuated
by pumping the unreacted H2Se and water (side product)
first over CdO-loaded silica and then into the atmosphere through
the fume hood, and the films were removed for analysis and further
treatments.

Preparation of the CE
The CE and
the electrolyte solution
were prepared as in the literature.12 The
electrolyte solution containing 2 M Na2S·9H2O and 2 M S was prepared in 10 mL of water. The CE was prepared by
etching brass with 1 M HCl for 5 min at 70 °C and reacted with
0.1 M Na2S·9H2O solution.

ZnS Treatments
Prior to Solar Performance Measurement of the
Electrode
The photoanode electrode was dipped into 0.1 M
Zn(II) solution (prepared by [Zn(H2O)6](NO3)2) for 30 s, rinsed with ethanol, and then dipped
into 0.1 M S2– solution (prepared by Na2S·9H2O) for 30 s. This step was repeated three times
to ensure that all the pore surfaces are covered with ZnS nanoparticles.

Installation of the QDSSC
The above two electrodes
(meso-CdSe–SiO2–P25 or meso-CdSe–P25
as photoanode working electrode) and modified brass (CE) were sandwiched
using a spacer (Parafilm) and the above Na2S/S8 aqueous solution as the electrolyte in between and clamped with
a paper clip.

Instrumentation
The FTIR spectra
were recorded using
a Bruker TENSOR 27 model FTIR spectrometer. A Digi Tech TM DLATGS
detector with a resolution of 4.0 cm–1 in the 400–4000
cm–1 range was used. The spectra were recorded using
the samples coated on silicon wafers or using dry KBr pallets. The
micro-Raman spectra were recorded on a LabRAM confocal Raman microscope
with a 300 mm focal length. The spectrometer was equipped with a Ventus
LP 532 at 50 mW, diode-pumped solid-state laser operator at 20 mW,
with a polarization ratio of 100:1, a wavelength of 532.1 nm, and
a 1024 × 256 element charge coupled device camera. The signal
collected was transmitted via a fiber optic cable into a spectrometer
with 600 g/mm grating. The Raman spectra were collected by manually
placing the probe tip on the desired point of the sample over the
glass or silicon wafer. The XRD patterns were recorded on a Rigaku
MiniFlex diffractometer using a high-power Cu Kα source operating
at 30 kV/15 mA. The SEM images and the EDS data were obtained using
a FEI Quanta 200 FEG ESEM instrument and a Zeiss EVO-40 SEM instrument
operating at 15 kV, respectively, and a Bruker AXS XFlash detector
4010 attached to the same microscope using the same samples. TEM images
were recorded on FEI Tecnai G2 F30 and JEOL JEM 2100F instruments
at an operating voltage of 200 kV. The calcined film samples were
scraped and grounded in a mortar with 5 mL of ethanol and dispersed
using sonication for 5 min. One drop of the dispersed ethanol solution
was put on a TEM grid and dried under a powerful lamp. The N2 (77.4 K) sorption measurements were performed with a TriStar 3000
automated gas adsorption analyzer (MicroMetrics) in a relative pressure
range, P/P0, from 0.01
to 0.99. To provide high accuracy and precision in the determination
of P/P0, the saturation
pressure P0 was measured over 120 min
intervals. The powder samples of the films, obtained by scraping a
few glass slides, were dehydrated under a (∼10–2 Torr) vacuum for 3 h at 250 °C before measuring to remove adsorbed
water and volatile species in the pores. A Bruker Superconducting
FT-NMR spectrometer Advance TM 300 MHz WB spectrometer with a 7 mm
double-channel Bruker probehead was used at room temperature for 29Si MAS-NMR spectra. The solar performance measurements were
made by using an AM 1.5 solar simulator equipped with a 300 W xenon
lamp (model no. 81172, Oriel). The light intensity was set to 1000
W/m2 by using a reference Si photodiode. The I–V curves were obtained by applying an external
bias to the cell and measuring the generated photocurrent using a
Keithley model 2400 digital source meter.
