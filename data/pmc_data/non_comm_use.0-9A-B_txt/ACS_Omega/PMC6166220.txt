A rapid, transition metal-free, high-yielding,
tetrabutylammonium
bromide-promoted method of N-arylation is reported within. The optimized
conditions tolerated a wide range of secondary amines and was equally
effective with bromo- and chlorobenzene-including substituted aryl
halides. The developed method is found to be effective for N-arylation
when compared to earlier methods which involve harsh conditions, transition
metals, lack of scalability, and long reaction times. Our method utilizes
conventional heating only; it is readily scalable; and the products
are facile to purify.

Introduction
Recent advancements
in N-aryl bond formation have motivated medicinal
chemists to synthesize biologically important N-arylated compounds,
which earlier proved difficult to prepare.1 Because of the abundance of natural products, drugs of pharmaceutical
importance, pesticides, and color pigments containing N-arylated amines,
efficient methods have been developed, including Buchwald–Hartwig
and Ullmann couplings, among others.2 Copper
or palladium metals, with or without other ligands, are generally
required for the synthesis of C–N bonds in these well-known
reactions.2

Though these reactions
are widely used for the synthesis of aryl
amines, some suffer several drawbacks as they require the use of a
metal, harsh reaction conditions, and costly reagents. Because contamination
of the product with the transition metal is of concern, much effort
has been devoted toward the development of metal-free N-arylation
reactions.3 Recently, Huang et al. reported
the metal-free synthesis of N-aryl tertiary amines in which they reacted
methyl and ethyl-derivatized tertiary amines with various aryl halides
with excess potassium tert-butoxide to obtain the
N-arylated product.4 Fang and co-workers
also used aliphatic tertiary amines for the synthesis of arylated
amines by using potassium hydroxide as a base.5 Shi et al. developed a rapid microwave-assisted synthesis of secondary
and tertiary aryl amines in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and excess potassium tert-butoxide in good yields.6 Although the above methods were effective in generating the N-arylated
products, the method of Fang et al. required 24 h to obtain moderate
yields. Shi’s method requires the use of a microwave reactor,
making scalability a challenge. In an attempt to identify a simple,
efficient, and scalable method for the synthesis of N-aryl amines,
we report rapid, metal-free tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB)-promoted
arylation of secondary amines using bromo- and chlorobenzene.

Results
and Discussion
Bromobenzene (0.20 mL, 2 mmol) and morpholine
(0.26 mL, 3 mmol)
were chosen as substrates for reaction optimization (Scheme 1) with potassium tertiary butoxide
(KOtBu) as the base in DMSO (2 mL). We
first studied the protocol of Shi et al. for large-scale synthesis
by simply heating for 12 h with no microwave (Scheme 1).6 The method
was successful in generating the N-arylated product, but only in 65%
yield. Prolonged reaction time (greater than 12 h), increasing the
temperature, or increasing the amount of base failed to increase the
yields. After reviewing the literature, we found that TBAB has been
successfully used in several carbon–heteroatom and carbon–carbon
bond formation reactions, halogenation, and oxidation reactions. Johnson
et al. utilized TBAB to efficiently alkylate sulfoximines;7 Wang et al. employed TBAB to rapidly alkylate
acridone in a high yield;8 Majumdar et
al. reported a TBAB-promoted S-alkylation of 4-mercapto-6-methyl-2-pyrone
with allyl and propargyl halides under mild conditions with moderate
to high yields;9 and Lebel et al. reported
the synthesis of a complex polydentate phosphane ligand by utilizing
TBAB-catalyzed P-alkylation of phosphane borane in excellent yields.10

Scheme 1 Optimized Conditions for the Reaction
Encouraged by the successful
alkylations noted above under phase-transfer
conditions, we also searched the literature for examples of TBAB being
used under nonphase transfer conditions. Li et al. and Tang
et al. noted that TBAB could serve as an activator/additive to promote
both substitution and cross-coupling reactions, respectively.11 On the basis of these findings, we attempted
to utilize TBAB under nonphase transfer conditions. We were encouraged
to see that complete consumption of the starting material occurred
after 30 min with an isolated yield of 85% when 50 mol % (161 mg)
TBAB was used. Hoping to further optimize the reaction conditions,
we increased the loading of TBAB but were met with decreased yields.
TBAB loading was then lowered systematically until it was found that
5 mol % was optimal (Figure 1). Using these conditions, N-phenylmorpholine
(Table 1, entry 9)
was obtained in 95% yield in only 8 min. When the reaction was conducted
at 100 °C, the reaction furnished the N-arylated product in excellent
yield but required greater than double the time interval for completion.
Below 100 °C, the reaction was sluggish and required several
hours to complete.

We then screened
different solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, EtOH,
dimethylformamide, and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP)
to assess if further optimization was possible. NMP proved to be the
only other suitable solvent for our reaction conditions, but produced
lower yield than that obtained from DMSO. After the solvent, time,
and TBAB loading conditions were established, we carried out multiple
N-arylation reactions with several different secondary amines. This
method was equally effective with all secondary amines tested, and
the products were furnished in good to excellent yields (Table 1). Bromobenzenes substituted
with electron-donating or -withdrawing groups were also found to be
as effective as unsubstituted bromobenzene, yielding the mixture of
isomers in their expected ratios5,6 (Table 1). To test the scalability, three secondary
amines, dibutyl amine, piperidine, and morpholine, were selected for
reaction with bromobenzene (Table 1 entries 24, 25, and 26) on a 3 g scale. All reactions
were completed within 20 min in excellent yield (Table 1).

To further investigate
the scope and limitation of the reaction,
chlorobenzene was also chosen as a substrate. The reaction was completed
in equal time and a comparable yield to furnish 1-phenylmorpholine.
N-Arylated product with these optimized conditions showed either better
or comparable performance with earlier reported reactions in which
metal catalysts were used.1−3,11 On
further application to various alkyl amines, we found that that the
N-arylation of indole (Table 1, entry 10, yield 76%), 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (Table 1, entry 11, yield
86%), tetrahydroisoquinoline (Table 1, entry 12, yield 91%), even the sterically crowded
dicyclohexylamine (Table 1, entry 6, yield 82%), and diphenylamine (Table 1, entry 14, yield 79%) all proceeded
in good to excellent yields in short reaction times.

It is accepted
that the reaction proceeds mechanistically through
the generation of a benzyne intermediate (slow) followed by its rapid
quenching via the desired nucleophile (fast), as explained by the
mixture of isomers obtained from 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene, 4-bromotoluene,
and 4-bromoanisole with morpholine (entries 21, 22, and 23).5,6 The reactions were completed within 15 min, and isomers of the products
were formed in a 1:1 ratio, as indicated by nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) spectroscopy (see the Supporting Information).

Conclusions
C–N-aryl bond formation is one of the
most challenging tasks
in medicinal chemistry, with scalability and metal contamination being
major concerns with the current approaches. Herein, we have detailed
a scalable, high-yielding, and efficient TBAB-promoted N-arylation
of several secondary amines. Future studies will focus on determining
the mechanism through which TBAB promotes this reaction.

Experimental
Section
General Information
Reagents and solvents were of ACS
grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich or Alfa Aesar. Inert atmosphere
(N2 or argon) is not required. Anhydrous solvents were
used as provided without further purification. Reactions were monitored
by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), visualizing with an ultraviolet
lamp and I2. Flash column chromatography was performed
on RediSep Rf Gold columns with a Whatman Purisil 60A silica gel (230–400
mesh) loading column on a Teledyne Isco CombiFlash Rf. 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA 400 MHz NMR spectrometer
at 25 °C. All synthesized compounds were characterized by 1H NMR and electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry
analysis (in the case of 1-bromo-4-fluorobenzene). Chemical shifts
are reported in parts per million. The residual solvent peak was used
as the internal reference: CDCl3. Mass spectra were obtained
on an ESI time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Bruker amaZon X).

General
Procedure for the Synthesis of Tertiary Amines
To a dry round-bottom
flask (or pressure vial for low boiling amines)
was added bromobenzene/chlorobenzene (2.0 mmol) and secondary amine
(3.0 mmol) in 3 mL of DMSO, followed by TBAB (32.0 mg, 5 mol %) and
1.5 equiv potassium tert-butoxide (337.0 mg, 3.0
mmol). The reaction was heated at 130 °C and monitored by TLC
at frequent time intervals. The reaction mixture was allowed to cool,
diluted with water, and extracted with ethyl acetate (4×). The
organic layers were combined, washed with brine, dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The crude reaction
mixture was purified by column chromatography (0–20% ethyl
acetate/hexanes) to provide the desired tertiary amines. All resulting
products were verified by NMR (directly compared with the result from
previously published literature).
