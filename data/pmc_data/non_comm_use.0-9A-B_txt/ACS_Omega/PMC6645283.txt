Addressing
the direct control of surface wettability has been a
significant challenge for a variety of applications from self-cleaning
surfaces to phase-change applications. Surface wettability has been
traditionally modulated by installing surface nanostructures or changing
their chemistry. Among numerous nanofabrication efforts, the chemical
oxidation method is considered a promising approach because it allows
cost-effective, quick, and direct control of the morphologies and
chemical compositions of the grown nanofeatures. Despite the wide
applicability of the surface oxidation method, the precise control
of wetting behaviors through the growth of nanostructures has yet
to be addressed. Here, we investigate the wetting characteristics
of heterogeneous surfaces that contain two-level features (i.e., nanograsses
and nanoflowers) with different petal shapes and structural chemistry.
The difference in growth rates between nanograsses and nanoflowers
creates a time-evolving morphology that can be classified by grass-dominated
or flower-dominated regimes, which induces a wide range of water contact
angles from 120 to 20°. The following study systematically quantifies
the structural details and chemistry of nanostructures associated
with their wetting characteristics. This investigation of heterogeneous
surfaces will pave the way for selective growth of copper nanostructures
and thus a direct control of surface wetting properties for use in
future copper-based thermal applications.

Introduction
In recent years, controlling
the wettability of solid surfaces
has drawn significant attention for a variety of emerging interfacial
physics applications ranging from phase-change applications1,2 to self-cleaning surfaces3−5 and membrane surfaces.6 A rational design of the wetting behavior will
provide the unique interfacial physics control for performance breakthroughs
in the presented applications. In particular, the design of copper
surfaces’ wetting properties will be promising in phase-change
applications as copper is widely used in the industry. Various efforts
to control the wettability of copper-based surfaces have been pursued
through structural engineering methods,7,8 chemical modification
techniques,9−15 or a combination of the two methods.16 Of the listed nanostructuring techniques, chemical oxidation through
solution immersion proves to be an effective and low-cost method to
install nanostructures on two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
(3D) surfaces over a large area. By modulating the processing parameters
of chemical oxidation methods, such as process temperature, solution
immersion time, and chemical composition, different morphologies of
nanoscale copper oxide (CuO) can be created on copper surfaces. Examples
of CuO-based features in previous studies include different forms
of spheres,17 cylinders,18−21 flowers,22−24 and crystals.25 Despite the significant interest in the surface
engineering to modify surface properties, the majority of others work
has been limited to the manufacturing process itself. A comprehensive
understanding of wetting properties related to surface morphology
and chemistry is not well understood. Although the creation of heterogeneous
nanostructures has a potential to possess a wide range of wetting
properties26 because of multilevel hierarchy,
the control of their wetting behaviors has yet to be addressed. Although
typical chemical solutions yield a single level of random nanostructures,
the combination of chemical solutions used in our process can be designed
to create two-level features containing nanograsses and nanoflowers.
In such heterogeneous surfaces containing two-level features, the
different growth rates between nanograss and nanoflower exhibit time-evolving
morphologies that can be categorized by grass- and flower-dominated
regimes with immersion time. The presented chemical oxidation method
in this study enables a direct control of nanostructure morphologies
by modifying process parameters, including chemical composition and
immersion time, to modulate their surface wettability.

In this
study, we investigate the wetting properties of CuO nanofeatures
through (1) identifying two-level features such as nanograsses and
nanoflowers, (2) modifying the petal shapes (i.e., round or spiky
shapes) of nanograsses and nanoflowers by changing chemical concentrations,
and (3) defining time-evolving regimes from grass- to flower-dominated
regimes. For this, we fabricate various heterogeneous nanostructured
surfaces through the use of the chemical oxidation method to study
their surface morphology and chemistry. In brief, the fabricated CuO
nanograsses show water contact angles (WCAs) of 70–120°,
whereas CuO nanoflowers consistently show lower WCAs of 20–50°.
This study suggests the selective nanostructuring through a combination
of nanograsses and nanoflowers will enable a wide range of wettability
for use in various applications involving copper surface modification.

Results
and Discussion
We systemically modulate copper oxide nanostructures’
morphologies
by using different combinations of chemical solution composition as
well as immersion time (see the Method section
for the details). The combination of chemical solutions of NaOH and
K2S2O8 creates heterogeneous surfaces
possessing two-level features, such as nanograsses and nanoflowers.
During the oxidation process, nanograsses and nanoflowers exhibit
different nucleation densities and rates, creating time-dependent
nanostructure morphologies. In detail, nanograsses initially start
growing on the substrate within the “grass-dominated regime”
until the critical time tc, whereas the transition between morphological regimes occurs
at the flower area ratio ϕNF = 0.5. After t > tc, the nanoflowers keep
increasing their sizes with immersion time by the Ostwald ripening
mechanism24 and occasionally agglomerate
to form short chains and piles in the “flower-dominated regime”.

The different chemical compositions in the oxidation process affect
the morphology of nanograsses and nanoflowers due to their level of
alkalinity in the solutions.27 Solution
1 produces round-shaped features and thin, long nanowires, defined
as “round nanoflower” and “round nanograss”,
as indicated in the scanning electron microscope (SEM) images in Figures 1a–d and 2i. The lower NaOH concentration in solution 2 yields
spike-shaped features and wide, short nanowires, defined as “spiky
nanoflower” and “spiky nanograss” (see SEM images
in Figure 1e–h
and analysis in Figure 2i). The preferential growth of nanograsses occurs at surface defects
(i.e., impurities, scratches, and grain boundaries) that determine
the number of nanograsses, quickly leading to saturation. The tightly
packed nanograsses on such limited spaces of surface defects are prone
to depart from the surface and begin to agglomerate, forming clusterlike
nanoflowers to reduce their surface energy.28 The differences in the nanoflowers’ petal shapes are expected
to be contributed by the amount of nanograss agglomeration that occurs.
That is because a highly basic solution (solution 1) causes a more
active nanograss agglomeration, rounding the nanofeatures to produce
round nanoflowers, whereas the low agglomeration level of spiky nanograsses
causes rough-edged petals to form.

Figure 1 Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images
of time-evolving nanostructures
using different combinations of chemical solutions. Round nanograsses
and nanoflowers are prepared at immersion time of (a) t = 3, (b) t = 10, and (c–d) t = 15 min. Using different chemical concentrations, spiky nanograsses
and nanoflowers at (e) t = 3, (f) t = 10, and (g–h) t = 15 min are observed.
Close-up views show (d) round- and (h) spiky-shaped flower petals,
respectively. Insets illustrate the evolution of nanograsses and nanoflowers
with immersion time. All scale bars are 5 μm.

Figure 2 Effects of chemical immersion time on nanostructure morphologies.
Representative SEM images of round nanostructures from (a) top and
(b) side-angled view at t = 15 min. (c) The top and
side views enable the reconstruction of the three-dimensional topography
to calculate the nanostructures’ roughness. Image analysis
is followed to investigate the morphological details of nanoflowers,
including nanoflowers’ (d) diameters dNF, (e) maximum height hNF, (f)
number density nNF, (g) roughness r, and (h) the area ratio ϕNF. (i) Structural
information including length lNG, width wNG, and area ratio ϕNG of nanograss is plotted.

The image quantification of nanofeatures is conducted by
investigating
both top and side view SEM images (Figure 2a,b). The top view SEM images are used to
quantify the morphological details of nanograsses and nanoflowers
(i.e., the area ratio ϕ, diameter d, number
density n, length l, and width w), where the subscripts NG and NF denote nanograss and
nanoflower, respectively. The side view images are obtained using
the focus ion beam (FIB) technique, which mills the structure to enable
a top-angled view. The side view images through the FIB SEM technique
allow us to calculate nanoflower heights hNF and maximum peak height hNF,max. On
the basis of those top and side view 2D images, 3D topographical images
can be reconstructed to allow us to compute the roughness r by using a commercial software (MountainsMap, see Supporting Information). This postimage processing
analyzes the difference in contrast and brightness of an image of
interest to construct a relative topographical map with the estimation
of hNF,max. As a result, a representative
3D topography image of round nanoflowers is shown in Figure 2c.

The plot in Figure 2h showing the nanoflower
area ratio ϕNF confirms
that the nanofeature growth can be classified into two distinguishable
regimes: nanograsses-dominated (t < tc) and nanoflowers-dominated (t > tc) regimes, where ϕNF is the
ratio of the sum of individual flower area to the total area. The
transition between two-level morphologies occurs due to the different
growth rates of nanograss and nanoflowers and is shown to approximately
occur at tc = 7 min in this study. In
addition to the area fraction calculation, the nanoflowers’
diameter dNF and maximum height hNF,max with varying immersion times are plotted
in Figure 2d,e. The dNF and hNF,max are
directly measured from 2D SEM images from top and side view. The details
of hNF,max calculation is explained in
the Supporting Information. Over the entire
time, the round nanoflowers’ diameter is consistently 10–30%
larger than that of spiky nanoflowers. Larger diameters of round nanoflowers
result in smaller number density once the regime is stabilized at t = 15 min (Figure 2f). At this saturation point, both dNF and hNF,max remain constant
at 3–4 and 5–7 μm, respectively, whereas the ϕNF continues to increase up to ∼0.6 (Figure 2h).

Another important
structural parameter that affects surface wettability
is the roughness r, defined as the ratio of the interfacial
surface to projected surface; thus, a flat surface will have r = 1. The r values with varying morphologies
are computed using 3D images, as shown in Figure 2g. The r of the round nanostructure
is 75% larger than that of the spiky nanostructure in the grass-dominated
regime (t < tc) due
to its larger nucleation density. In the flower-dominated regime (t > tc), the r of round nanoflowers is 25–50% smaller than that of spiky
nanoflowers. Such a noticeable increase in the r of
spiky nanoflowers is contributed by the spiky nanoflowers’
sharp-edged petals as well as larger number density n in the flower-dominated regime.

We perform a point-by-point
energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS)
analysis to understand how the chemical composition of individual
nanofeatures affects their wetting properties. The ratio of the surface
copper to oxygen Cu/O for both round and spiky nanofeatures is plotted
as a function of immersion time in Figure 3a,b. In Figure 3a, round nanograsses in the grass-dominated
regime show a larger ratio of surface content (Cu/O = 0.3–0.4
at t < tc) than
round nanoflowers (Cu/O = 0.1–0.2), where the surface is mostly
covered by grasses instead of flower. Thereby, the resulting wetting
properties of round nanostructures (t < tc) will be determined by the greater presence
of copper, as indicated in Figure 4a. In Figure 3b, spiky nanograsses in the grass-dominated regime show a
much larger ratio of surface content (Cu/O = 0.6 at t < tc), whereas spiky nanoflowers
show a lower ratio of surface content (Cu/O = 0.1–0.2). However,
the nucleation density of spiky nanograss is smaller than that of
round nanograss. The resulting nanograss area ratio ϕNG = ∼0.2 (Figure 2i) at t = 3 min minimizes the impact of copper-containing
spiky nanograsses on the wetting properties (Figure 4a). As time evolves in the flower-dominated
regime, the ratio of surface content for all four entities gradually
reduces (i.e., the level of oxide increases) to generate hydrophilic
surfaces. On the basis of the morphologies and chemistry of nanofeatures,
the phase diagram in Figure 4a shows the governing surface chemistry (copper vs oxide)
depending on the structural evolving stages (grass-dominated regime
vs flower-dominated regime) for both morphologies (round and spiky
features). In this phase diagram, round and spiky nanograsses (t < tc) possessing more copper
suggest relative hydrophobicity, whereas nanoflowers show more oxide
components.

Figure 3 Nanostructure chemistry details using energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS) analysis. The ratio of surface copper to oxygen is presented
for (a) round and (b) spiky nanofeatures with varying immersion times.
The highlighted regime indicates a higher copper content in nanograsses
at t < tc.

Figure 4 (a) Phase diagram shows the dependency of surface chemistry
(copper
regime vs oxide regime) on morphology (grass-dominated regime vs flower-dominated
regime). (b) Wettability measured for both round and spiky nanofeatures
with varying immersion times shows decreasing water contact angles
with immersion time. (c) Variation in cos θ* as a function
of cos θ for round and spiky nanostructures demonstrates
that surface roughness governs the wetting behavior in the flower-dominated
regime, whereas surface chemistry dominates the grass-dominated regime.
(d) Temperature-dependent water contact angles for round and spiky
nanostructures (t = 25 min).

In addition to the EDS analysis about the surface oxide,
we conduct
grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GI-XRD, Rigaku Smartlab X-ray
Diffractometer) to confirm the average surface composition of nanostructures
up to 0.6 μm in depth.29,30 The relative-intensity-ratio
(RIR) method quantifies the surface phase percentage (Figure S6) from the XRD pattern (Figure S5), which shows a drastic increase in
the weight percent of CuO, whereas a decrease in the weight percent
of Cu with increasing immersion time for all the nanofeatures is observed.
This indicates that the formation of nanoflowers is accompanied by
the breaking of H-bonds at the edges of Cu(OH)2 layers
(see the Supporting Information for details).
Despite the changes in morphologies and chemical content ratios in
different features, all XRD patterns show the peaks at Cu, CuO, and
Cu(OH)2, validating our structures studied in this work
are all polymorphs.

After observing the changes in surface morphology
and chemistry,
we evaluate the wetting characteristics of the fabricated surfaces
by measuring their contact angles. For this, we use a contact angle
meter (MCA-3, Kyowa Interface Science) that dispenses nanoliter-sized
droplets. A high-speed camera at 100 000 fps captures transient
and temperature-dependent liquid films on structured surfaces. The
contact angle measurements are taken at 10 different locations on
each sample to account for spatial variation. The measured WCAs are
plotted as a function of the immersion time in Figure 4b. In the grass-dominated regime, round nanograsses
exhibit relatively hydrophobic wettability, showing the WCAs of 110–70°.
This might be attributed to the dominance of surface copper in nanograsses,
as illustrated by the phase diagram in Figure 4a. Because the regimes are predominantly
covered by nanoflowers as t increases, both round
and spiky nanoflowers contain more surface oxide and show hydrophilicity.
Spiky nanoflowers consistently show lower WCAs because of the combination
of surface chemistry and sharp morphology.

The role of structural
information and chemistry related to surface
wettability can be explained by Wenzel’s31 or Cassie’s model.32 In
Wenzel’s model, a liquid is assumed to completely fill the
grooves of a rough surface, whereas vapor pockets are assumed to be
trapped underneath a liquid drop, creating a composite surface in
Cassie’s model. Because most surfaces reported in this study
are hydrophilic, we employ the Wenzel’s analysis to explain
the correlation between surface chemistry and its wettability. The
Wenzel’s model is expressed as cos θ* = r cos θ where θ* is the apparent
contact angle on a rough surface, θ is the contact angle on
a flat surface with identical chemical composition,31 and r is the roughness. In this analysis,
θ (∼75–90°) is calculated using θ*
(WCAs on nanostructured surfaces) and r from image
analysis on the basis of Wenzel’s equation. The data sets are
placed in the Wenzel quadrant, as plotted in Figure 4c. Both round and spiky nanofeatures show
a relatively noticeable difference (dθ ∼15°)
between the regimes, confirming the difference in structural chemistry
from grasses to flowers. Again, both round and spiky nanostructures
show a small deviation (dθ ∼5°
at t > tc), revealing
that r governs the wettability. The use of Wenzel’s
equation is valid in this study because the droplet diameter (300–400
μm) is 2 orders of magnitude larger than the characteristic
length of the nanostructures (∼5–8 μm),33,34 whereas the gravity effect is negligible.

In addition to the
modulation of WCAs via tuning the nanofeature
morphology, it is important to investigate the temperature-dependent
wetting properties of such nanofeatures because of their potential
use in heat transfer devices. In particular, it is of interest to
investigate our most hydrophilic samples (i.e., fabricated at t = 25 min) for the use in heat pipe applications at elevated
temperature.1,11 Here, we vary the substrate temperatures
ranging from 25 to 90 °C using a thermal stage attached to the
substrate to measure the temperature-dependent WCAs, as plotted in Figure 4d. In this process,
temperatures are confirmed with a thermocouple taped to the thermoelectric
modules and the sample surface. Spiky nanoflowers show a gradual increase
in WCAs with increasing temperatures, whereas round nanoflowers show
constant WCAs. This phenomenon might be attributed to the formation
of local vapor blankets below the highly rough spiky nanoflowers.
In general, this measurement confirms the creation of stable and hydrophilic
nanostructured surfaces at higher temperatures.

Conclusions
In
this work, we report the wetting behaviors of heterogeneous
surfaces containing two-level features of nanograsses and nanoflowers
that are fabricated using a chemical oxidation method. The variation
in chemical solutions creates round- or spiky-shaped flower petals,
providing different structural roughness over the nanostructures.
The difference in nucleation rates of grass and flower related to
the immersion time dictates the presence of a grass-dominated regime
(t < tc) and flower-dominated
regime (t > tc), which
is separated by a transition time (tc =
7 min). With these structures, grass-dominated regimes show larger
water contact angles due to the presence of surface copper, whereas
flower-dominated regimes consistently show smaller water contact angles.
In the flower-dominated regime, the surface roughness is a dominating
factor in determining the surface wettability, as demonstrated with
the Wenzel equation. In addition to this, the temperature-dependent
wettability of hydrophilic nanostructured surfaces is reported for
their potential use in thermofluidic applications. The new knowledge
gained in this study will help us to understand the design parameters
of heterogeneous surfaces containing multilevel nanofeatures to directly
control their wetting characteristics.

Method
The copper
substrate samples with a size of 1 cm x 1 cm and thickness
of 0.15 cm (McMaster-Carr, purity 99.9%) are polished with grits of
220, 320, 400, 600, 800, 1000, and 1200 and rinsed with acetone, methanol,
and isopropanol for 30 s, followed by additional deionized water.
The samples are cleaned using 2 M HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) to remove the
nascent copper oxide film and then immersed in either (1) solution
1: 2 M NaOH and 0.1 M K2S2O8 (Sigma-Aldrich)
or (2) solution 2: 1 M NaOH and 0.1 M K2S2O8 at room temperature. The solution immersion techniques have
been very useful, as most allow scalable, simple, and direct control
of engineered features’ morphologies and chemical compositions
over a large area.
