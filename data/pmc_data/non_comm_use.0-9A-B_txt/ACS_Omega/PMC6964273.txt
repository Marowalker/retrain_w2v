A library of hybrid and dimer compounds based on the
natural scaffold
of artemisinin was synthesized. These derivatives were obtained by
coupling of artemisinin derivatives, artesunate, and dihydroartemisinin
with a panel of phytochemical compounds. The novel artemisinin-based
hybrids and dimers were evaluated for their anticancer activity on
a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa) and on three complementary metastatic
melanoma cancer cell lines (SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24, and RPMI-7951). Two
hybrid compounds obtained by coupling of artesunate with eugenol and
tyrosol, and one of the dimer compounds containing curcumin, emerged
as the most active and cancer-selective derivatives.

==== Body
Introduction
Artemisinin (1) is a sesquiterpene
from Artemisia annua L. (sweet wormwood)1 characterized by a reactive 1,2,4-trioxane ring
(endoperoxide
bridge) and a lactone moiety as pharmacophores (Figure 1).2 This compound
is applied in the treatment of different types of malaria.3 Semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin 2, artesunate 3, and artemether 4, have been developed with the aim of increasing the pharmacological
activity and the pharmacokinetic profile of the parent drug (Figure 1).4 In addition, artemisinin and artemisinin derivatives showed
remarkable activity against cancer cell lines,5 including leukemia, melanoma, breast, ovarian, prostate, colon,
and renal cancers, without inducing cytotoxicity in normal cells.6 This selectivity is due to the iron-mediated
cleavage of the endoperoxide bridge in tumor cells containing a higher
concentration of this metal with respect to their normal cell counterpart.7 Moreover, tumor cells usually show a diminished
expression of antioxidant enzymes able to scavenge radical species.8 Iron catalyzes the ring opening of the endoperoxide
bridge of artemisinin, with subsequent generation of free-radical
reactive oxygen and carbon-centered species,9 followed by oxidative DNA damage. The mechanism is also responsible
for the antimalarial effect of artemisinin, in which case the radical
cascade is triggered by iron atoms delivered during the metabolic
breakdown of hemoglobin in the vacuole of the parasite.10

Figure 1 Artemisinin and semisynthetic derivatives of artemisinin
and phytochemicals.

Recently, the synthesis of hybrid and dimer derivatives
of bioactive
natural substances turned out to be a useful strategy to increase
both biological activity and pharmacokinetic profiles, avoiding drug-resistance
phenomena with respect to the individual starting compounds.11 Dimers and hybrids of artemisinin and artemisinin
derivatives in association with bioactive phytochemicals, such as
thymoquinone, showed increased antileukemia and antimalarial activity.12 Different dimers and hybrids of artemisinin
derivatives containing natural phenol and catechol residues, such
as 2-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethanol and 3-hydroxytyrosol, have also been
patented.13

We report here the synthesis
of a novel library of artemisinin-based
hybrid and dimer derivatives obtained by chemical coupling of dihydroartemisinin 2 and artesunate 3 with chemopreventive phytochemicals,
including curcumin 5, eugenol 6, perillyl
alcohol 7, tyrosol 8, α-tocopherol 9, and δ-tocopherol 10, respectively (Figure 1).14 The products were evaluated on melanoma, the main cause
of skin-cancer-related death and one of the most aggressive and lethal
pathology in human.15 In this context,
phytochemicals 5–10 showed antimelanoma activity
as isolated compounds or components of natural extracts.16−19

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Artemisinin-Based Hybrid and Dimer Derivatives
The hybrid derivatives of artemisinin, 11i–vi, were synthesized by a procedure involving the reaction
between artesunate 3 (1.0 mmol) and the appropriate phytochemical, 5–10 (1.1 mmol), in the presence of N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)
(1.2 mmol) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) (catalytic amount) as
coupling agents (Scheme 1). Compounds 11i–vi were obtained,
as the only recovered products, besides the unreacted substrate, from
acceptable to high yield (Table 1).

Reaction between Artesunate 3 and Phytochemicals 5–10a,b
a The reactions were performed by
treating artesunate 3 (1.0 mmol) with DCC (1.2 mmol),
DMAP (catalytic amount), and the appropriate phytochemical, 5–10 (1.1 mmol), at 25 °C for 18h.

b Experiments were conducted
in triplicate.

In addition, dimeric derivatives of artemisinin 11vii and 11viii were synthesized using phytochemicals
bearing
two reactive functional groups, such as curcumin 5 (two
OH phenol moieties) and tyrosol 8 (OH phenol and primary
alcohol moieties). In these latter cases, an excess of artesunate 3 (2.2 mmol) was required to optimize the yield of the desired
product (Chart 1).
Note that compound 11viii was characterized by a C-2
internal symmetry property.

Chart 1 Structures of Dimeric Derivatives 11vii and 11viii
Finally, 4-hydroxyphenethyl bromide 12 was used as
an electrophilic alkylating agent to obtain hybrid derivatives 11ix and 11x from artesunate 3 and
dihydroartemisinin 2, respectively (Scheme 2). The reactions were performed
under general basic catalysis conditions (K2CO3) in dimethylformamide (DMF, 10 mL) at 90 °C.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Hybrid
Derivatives 11ix (46%) and 11x (53%) from
Artesunate 3 and Dihydroartemisinin 2, respectively
In terms of structure relationships, compounds 11iv and 11ix were characterized by a different
regioselectivity
in the linkage of the tyrosol moiety to the artesunate scaffold, that
is phenolic (11iv) versus primary alcohol (11ix) coupling site, respectively. The tyrosol moiety was linked to artesunate
and dihydroartemisinin only by the primary alcoholic function in compounds 11ix and 11x.

Biological Activity
Artemisinin derivatives can inhibit
metastasis20 and angiogenesis processes,21 influencing some cancer-related signaling pathways.22 We evaluated the anticancer activity of artemisinin 1, dihydroartemisinin 2, artesunate 3, and artemisinin derivatives 11i–x by cell survival [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium
bromide] (MTT) assay on a drug-resistant cervical cancer cell line
(HeLa) and three complementary metastatic melanoma cancer cell lines,
SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24, and RPMI-7951, respectively. The genetic characteristics
of the SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24, and RPMI-7951 cell lines are summarized
in Table 2. A normal
human primary fibroblast cell line (C3PV) was used as a reference.

d Mutation
protein sequencing.

All three melanoma cell lines show the mutation of
the B-RAF gene,
which is involved in the regulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway, controlling
cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and apoptosis. The
B-RAF gene mutation is highly frequent in both primary and metastatic
melanoma cells, accounting for 50.9 and 66.3% of the total observed
mutations, respectively.23 Two cell lines,
SK-MEL-3 and RPMI-7951, are mutated on the TP53 gene, which controls
the synthesis of the p53 protein, involved in cell division and prevention
of cancer formation.24 Finally, the RPMI-7951
and SK-MEL24 cell lines were characterized by the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)25 and phosphatase
and tensin homolog (PTEN)26 gene mutations,
controlling the production of tumor suppressor proteins.

Phytochemicals 5–10, and the well-known
anticancer drug, paclitaxel (Taxol), were used as references. Table 3 reports the IC50 values (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) of the tested
compounds. The stability of compound 11iv in the cell
culture medium has been evaluated by thin-layer chromatographic (TLC)
and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses as a selected
example. No traces of tyrosol were observed during 48 h, confirming
the stability of the ester bond under the reported experimental conditions
(see the Supporting Information SI #1–2 and Figures S1–S3).

In the case of the HeLa cell line, artemisinin derivatives
were
less active than paclitaxel, with an antiproliferative effect comparable
to that of artemisinin. The dimer, 11vii, containing
the tyrosol scaffold, showed a remarkable anticancer activity against
both SK-MEL24 and RPMI-7951 melanoma cell lines, with IC50 values (0.24 and 0.49 μM, respectively) lower than, or comparable
to, those of artemisinin and paclitaxel, respectively. Unfortunately, 11vii was also characterized by a significant activity against
the C3PV cell line. The dimer, 11viii, containing the
curcumin scaffold, was active against all melanoma cell lines studied,
without any appreciable effect on the C3PV cell.

Note that perillyl
alcohol 7 and tyrosol 8 showed higher activity
and lower toxicity when incorporated into
the artemisinin scaffold, as in the case of hybrids 11iii (Table 3, entry 6
versus entry 16) and 11ix (Table 3, entry 12 versus entry 17) against the SK-MEL24
and RPMI-7951 cell lines, respectively.

Compounds 11iv and 11ix showed antiproliferative
activity against all studied melanoma cell lines, with acceptable
tolerability toward the C3PV cell line. They were characterized by
a toxicity higher than that of tyrosol 8, highlighting
a different effect of the artemisinin scaffold on the toxicity of
the hybrid, depending on the nature of the associated phytochemical.

Artemisinin 1 and the novel artemisinin derivatives, 11iii–iv, 11viii, and 11ix, were found to be cancer-selective, being not cytotoxic
on normal cell line C3PV. Moreover, compound 11iv possessed
a melanoma-specific cancer selectivity (inactive against HeLa).

As a general trend, curcumin 5 was the most effective
phytochemical in the dimer-type derivatives, whereas perillyl alcohol 7 and tyrosol 8 were the most effective in the
hybrid-type compounds. Moreover, artesunate appeared to be the most
active artemisinin derivative. To obtain information about the mechanism
of action of compounds 11iii–iv, 11viii, and 11ix, we repeated the cellular assays
on the cancer lines in the presence of the iron chelating agent, deferoxamine
(DFO),27,28 able to inhibit the redox activation of
the endoperoxide ring.

As reported in Table 4, the presence of DFO significantly lowered
the efficacy of artemisinin 1, confirming the beneficial
role of iron in triggering the
radical cascade mechanism responsible for the anticancer activity.
A similar pathway was observed for compounds 11iv and 11ix containing the tyrosol scaffold. Instead, the anticancer
activity of perillyl alcohol and curcumin in 11iii and 11viii was found to be independent from the presence of iron,
suggesting the possibility of an alternative mechanism. Regarding
the SK-MEL24 line, the activity of the four synthetic compounds seems
to be not influenced by the iron chelation mediated by DFO.

Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) analysis was
further performed
to characterize the radical species formed during the endoperoxide
ring opening in the presence of Fe(II)SO4 as a catalyst
(for the general procedure see SI #3). Figure 2 shows the EPR spectra
of 2-methyl-nitrosopropane (MNP) adducts of artesunate derivatives 11iii, 11iv, 11ix, and 11viii, recorded as representative
active samples (25 °C, t = 0), in comparison
with the appropriate reference [that is, the compound and MNP without
the Fe(II) salt].

Figure 2 Room-temperature CW-EPR spectra of (a) 11iv, (b) 11iii, (c) 11ix, and (d) blank, all
recorded
at t = 0 in the presence of the spin trap MNP. Experimental
conditions: ν = 9.86GHz, 0.1 mT modulation amplitude, and 0.63
mW microwave power.

The EPR spectra of hybrid derivatives 11iv and 11iii (Figure 2, lines a and b, respectively) show the same line shape
with giso = 2.006 ± 0.0001, AN = 1.49 ± 0.1mT, and AH = 0.3±0.01mT. In accordance with the EPR results
previously
reported for artemisinin,29 the magnetic
parameters of artesunate derivatives 11iv and 11iii clearly identified the formation of a secondary C-centered radical.30 The EPR signal decreased over time (Figures S4 and S5, respectively). For hybrid
derivative 11ix (line c), the C-centered radical is present
with a low intensity at t = 0, being stable during
all recorded times (see Figure S6). Unexpectedly,
in the case of dimer derivative 11viii (Figure S8), no radical formation was detected (only at t = 90 min a very weak signal appeared, but it was no more
present at t = 150 min). Note that artesunate alone
showed a different behavior with respect to hybrids 11iv and 11iii (Figure S7).

Even though a direct correlation between the in vitro EPR analysis
of artemisinin derivatives and the in-cell anticancer activity cannot
be made, in the case of compound 11iv, the formation
of a secondary C-centered radical was in accordance with the role
suggested for this type of intermediate in the biological activity
of artemisinin.29 Moreover, the biological
activity of 11iv dropped after treatment with DFO, whereas
that of compound 11viii, deprived of an EPR signal, was
unaffected by the DFO treatment.

Conclusions
A library of novel derivatives with hybrid
and dimer structures
were synthesized by coupling between artesunate and dihydroartemisinin,
with six phytochemicals, curcumin, eugenol, perillyl alcohol, tyrosol,
and α- and δ-tocopherol. Among the novel derivatives, 11iii–iv, 11viii, and 11ix showed a significant and selective anticancer activity.
Moreover, the hybrid derivative, 11iv, was characterized
by a specific melanoma selectivity, being inactive against HeLa cells.
This compound showed the formation of a secondary C-centered radical
in the EPR analysis. DFO studies on the role of endoperoxide ring
opening in the antimelanoma activity of 11iv confirmed
the relevant role of the formation of radical intermediates in the
biological effect. Surprisingly, the anticancer activity of dimer 11viii was not dependent on the formation of radical species,
leaving open the possibility for other mechanisms to be operative.
Further studies aimed at the determination of topoisomerase I as a
possible target for the activity of these novel derivatives, as well
as transcriptome comparison with other efficient antimelanoma drugs
are still ongoing.

Experimental Section
Chemistry: General Part
All reactions were performed
in flame-dried glassware under a nitrogen atmosphere. Reagents were
obtained from commercial suppliers (Sigma-Aldrich Srl, Milan, Italy)
and used without further purification. TLC chromatography was performed
on precoated aluminum silica gel SIL G/UV254 plates (Macherey-Nagel
& Co.). The detection occurred via fluorescence quenching or development
in a molybdato phosphate solution (10% in EtOH). Merck silica gel
60 was used for flash chromatography (23–400 mesh). All products
were dried in high vacuum (10-3 mbar). 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker Avance
DRX400 (400 MHz/100 MHz) and on a Bruker Avance DPX200 (200 MHz/50
MHz) spectrometers. Chemical shifts for protons are reported in parts
per million (δ scale) and internally referenced to the CD3OD or CDCl3 signal at δ 3.33 and 7.28 ppm,
respectively. Mass spectral (MS) data were obtained using an Agilent
1100 LC/MSD VL system (G1946C) with a 0.4 mL/min flow rate using a
binary solvent system of 95:5 methyl alcohol/water. UV detection was
monitored at 254 nm. Mass spectra were acquired in positive and negative
mode scanning over the mass range. Elemental analyses (C, H, N) were
performed in house. Artemisinin, dihydroartemisinin, and artesunate
were obtained from Lachifarma s.r.l. (Zollino (LE), Italy).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Derivatives 11i–vii
To a solution of artesunate (0.52
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in dry CH2Cl2 (3.0 mL), DCC
(0.52 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and DMAP (0.16 mmol, 30 mol %) were added at
room temperature. After the addition of the opportune phytochemical
(0.52 mmol, 1.0 equiv), the reaction mixture was slowly stirred overnight
(18 h) under a N2 atmosphere. The precipitated dicyclohexylurea
was removed by filtration, and the solvent was removed under reduced
pressure. The residue was purified by gradient column chromatography
(hexane/EtOAc 1:1, 1:2).

Biological Part
Cell Culture Condition
The C3PV cell line is a primary
human fibroblast grown according to Botta et al.31 SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24 and RPMI-7951 are three different metastatic
melanoma cancer cell lines. SK-MEL3 was grown in McCoy’s medium
supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/mL),
and streptomycin (1 mg/mL). SK-MEL24 and RPMI-7951 were grown in Eagle’s
minimum essential medium containing 15 and 10% FBS, respectively,
penicillin (100 U/mL), and streptomycin (1 mg/mL). All cell lines
were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere (95%) and
5% CO2.

Treatment Protocol: General Procedure
To study the
effect of artemisinin and its derivatives on cell viability, the C3PV,
SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24, and RPMI-7951 cell lines were seeded in 96-well
plates (6000 cells/well in 100 μL of medium) and incubated overnight
to allow cell adherence. Afterward, the medium was replaced with fresh
medium containing the appropriate dose of compounds. Artemisinin and
its derivatives were used in a range of 0.01 to 1 μM for 24
h. The analyses of cell viability were done at the end of treatment.
The assays were performed in quadruplicate for both treatments.

Treatment Protocol for DFO Assay
To study the mechanism
of action of artemisinin and compounds 11iii, 11iv, 11viii, and 11ix, the SK-MEL3, SK-MEL24
and RPMI-7951 cell lines were seeded in 96-well plates (6000 cells/well
in 100 μL of medium) and incubated overnight to allow cell adherence.
Afterward, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing DFO
(20 μM) for 1 h. Then the appropriate dose of artemisinin and
its compounds 11iii, 11iv, and 11viii were added for 24 h. The analyses of cell viability were done at
the end of treatment. The assays were performed in quadruplicate for
both treatments.

Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability was evaluated using
MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide]
cell proliferation assay. Briefly, after incubation for 3 h at 37
°C with MTT (0.5 mg/mL), the supernatant was replaced with 100
μL of analysis solution containing 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate
and 0.6% acetic acid in dimethyl sulfoxide to dissolve the formazan
crystals. Optical density measurements were performed with a scanning
spectrophotometer DTX880 Multimode Detector (Beckman Coulter) using
a 630 nm (background) and a 570 nm filter.

Statistical Analysis
The IC50 values were
determined by nonlinear regression using the program, graphpad prism
6. The SI values were calculated using the formula
