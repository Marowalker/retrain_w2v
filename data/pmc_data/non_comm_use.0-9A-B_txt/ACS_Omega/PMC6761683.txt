In the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture industry, gaping (the separation
of muscle bundles
from the connective tissue) is a major quality problem. This study
characterized chondroitin sulfate (CS) and heparan sulfate (HS) in
the connective tissue of intact and gaping salmon fillets from 30
salmon by mass spectrometry. Statistical difference was detected between
gaping and intact tissues only when comparing pairwise samples from
the same individual (n = 10). The gaping tissue had
a lower content of monosulfated CS disaccharides (p = 0.027), and the relative distribution of CS disaccharides was
significantly different (p < 0.05). The HS chains
were short (average = 14.09, SD = 4.91), and the intact tissue seemed
to have a more uniform HS chain structure compared to the gaping tissue.
Time-series samples from the same individuals are recommended for
future research to improve the understanding of reasons and implications
of these differences.

Introduction
The fish muscle myotomes
are arranged as folded sheets that are
joined together in layers along the longitudinal axis of the fish
by connective tissue, the myocommata. Gaping is defined as the phenomenon
in which the connective tissue of fish fillets is weakened and fails
to hold the muscle myotomes together, resulting in holes and slits
in the fillet. Gaping poses a major problem for the aquaculture and
fisheries industries due to the unappealing appearance and limitations
in specialized food production of the fillets, which causes down-rating
of the quality classification and hence affects pricing.1

The location of tearing has been found
to be in the sarcolemma
(the cell membrane of the muscle cells), which connects the muscle
fibers to the myocommatal sheets of the extracellular matrix (ECM)
and, in the innermost layer of the myocommata, the basement membrane.2,3 The myocommata–muscle fiber interface has a lower degree
of connection as gaping increases.4,5 Both in the
ECM and in the sarcolemma, the components collagen, proteoglycans
(PGs), and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) interact to form a structural
network, which is known to influence strongly the textural properties
of various tissue types including connective tissue.6,7 The main structural component of the ECM is collagen, and the solubility
of major collagen types (I and V) has long been suspected to be higher
in gaping tissue.8−10 However, collagen is not the only factor affecting
the strength of the ECM. Research in many different fields have revealed
that GAG chains of PGs contribute significantly to the formation of
a functional collagen network and thus to the structural integrity
of connective tissue.11−14

There are four main groups of GAGs: chondroitin sulfate (CS)/dermatan
sulfate (DS), heparin/heparan sulfate (HS), keratan sulfate (KS),
and hyaluronan. They are linear polysaccharides whose disaccharide
building blocks consist of an amino sugar (N-acetylglucosamine
or N-acetylgalactosamine) and an uronic acid (glucuronic
acid or iduronic acid) or galactose. PGs are glycoproteins covalently
modified with heparin, HS, CS/DS, and/or KS chains (see study of Iozzo
and Schaefer7 for the nomenclature). The
GAG chains are much larger than other types of glycans typically found
on PGs, and they therefore tend to dominate the chemical properties
of the PGs.6,15 Many PGs also exhibit differences
in the number of GAG chains, their lengths, and the arrangement of
sulfated residues along the chains depending on the PG’s tissue
location and function.16,17 A study examining the effect
of GAGs on matrix production, distribution, and functionality by inhibiting
GAG incorporation18 showed that an incomplete
proteoglycan network resulted in a decrease in collagen deposition
and less cross-linked collagen. This work suggested that the GAG incorporation
in PGs contributes to the formation of a functional collagen network.
In addition, a major function of PGs is binding collagen fibers together
and anchoring cells to collagen or basement membranes.7,13,19−22 Some researchers claim that the
degradation of the myocommata is caused mainly by the degradation
of the PGs.23 The content of sulfated GAGs
has been shown to differ between fish species, which are differently
prone to gaping.24 Also, content of various
PGs known to interact with collagen were shown to vary among these
species,21 and the degradation of the intramuscular
connective tissue in Pacific rockfish (Sebastes sp.)
has also been related to both increased solubility of collagen and
degradation of the GAGs.11 However, most
published studies that analyzed the PG and GAG content in connection
with fillet quality in other fish species and salmon fillets (e.g.,
refs (25) and (26)) have not focused on gaping.

The aim of this study was to examine the content and structure
of GAGs in gaping and intact salmon fillets in detail. Although all
GAG types are of importance, CS and HS were of most interest in this
instance as they are parts of PGs and they were estimated to be present
in the tissue in adequate amounts for MS measurements. Liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS) methods are capable of providing detailed
knowledge of the structural diversities of GAGs in tissue.27 These methods provide insight into variations
in phenotypic distribution of GAGs in tissue of different origin,
developmental stage, or disease stage.27−35 The research presented here reveals the content and distribution
of structural phenotypes of the two GAGs, chondroitin sulfate (CS)
and heparan sulfate (HS), as well as comparisons between gaping and
intact connective tissues in farmed salmon (Salmo salar) fish fillets.

Results and Discussion
Chondroitin Sulfate
When digested with chondroitinase
ABC, the average amount of CS disaccharides detected was 0.9147 μg/mg
(SD = 0.4559) dried tissue. By comparison, extraction from fish heads,
bones, or other organs containing a higher content of GAGs than muscle
tissue generally resulted in higher amounts of extracted CS.36,37 The amounts of CS recovered from various diamond squid tissue types
were between 0.021 and 3.482 μg/mg defatted tissue,38 while another study39 detected 0.11 μg/mg sulfated CS disaccharides in rat muscle.
Therefore, the amounts recovered from salmon muscle tissue in this
study were at levels comparable with those found in similar tissue
of other animal species. In addition to disaccharides, the digestion
of CS resulted in a variety of mono- and oligosaccharides. In-source
dimer formation of nonsulfated and singly sulfated CS disaccharides
during ionization was also registered and included in the analysis.
The dimers were identified by having the same size exclusion chromatography
(SEC) retention times as the respective disaccharides but with m/z values corresponding to dimers (Table 1). To our knowledge,
there have not been any previous reports on in-source dimer formation
of glycosaminoglycans. However, multimer formation in MS analyses
of various compounds is not uncommon.40,41 All chondroitin
sulfates detected and included in the comparative analysis are listed
in Table 1, with m/z values, retention time, description of composition by
shorthand (adapted from ref (42)), and ion species detected.

The total ion chromatograms (TICs)
showed a considerable amount
of noise when samples were examined by SEC-HPLC, as illustrated by
a representative CS TIC in Figure 1a. An attempt to reduce the noise by precipitating
CS in chilled ethanol prior to chondroitinase digestion proved unsuccessful.
However, the base peak chromatograms (Figure 1b) show that relevant MS peaks could be analyzed
without any problems. A representative MS spectrum with various peaks
labeled is illustrated in Figure 1c. Representative extracted ion chromatograms (EICs)
of the most abundant dp1, dp3, and dp4 ion species are illustrated
in Figure 1d–f.

EICs of every ion species listed in Table 1 were measured for all samples, and comparisons
were made between gaping and intact tissue samples. No significant

the CS chain length, or the relative dp2 distribution when comparing
all gaping and intact samples. All measurements and statistical values
for the comparison between intact and gaping tissues are listed in Table 2.

a Welch’s t-test was used
to test for differences between intact (n = 14) and
gaping (n = 18) samples. The chain length
was estimated by dividing the total CS saccharide measurements adjusted
to disaccharide units with the amount detected of saturated dp1, dp3,
and dp5, which originate from the nonreducing end.

Chondroitin sulfate has a normal
chain length ranging from 40 to
120 disaccharide units, depending on tissue context,43 although shorter chains also have been reported.30 Therefore, the average CS chain length of 99.8
disaccharide units estimated in this study is within the expected
range. The length of the CS chain and molecular weight distribution
have been reported to have a considerable effect on CS function and
interaction with other molecules.44 The
average CS chain length of intact tissue was higher than that of gaping
tissue, but the difference was not significant (Table 2).

The dp3 composition [1,1,1,1,1]
(see Table 1) accounted
for between 93.3 and 99.8% of
the various mono- and oligosaccharides, excluding the dp2s. An earlier
study45 reported the presence of CS trisaccharides
resistant to chondroitinase digestion and concluded that they originated
from the reducing terminal end of CS chain and their release caused
by either alkaline treatment of the PG or presence of tissue endo-β-d-glucuronidases. Another study46 also detected these trisaccharides in shark cartilage and suggested
that they were generated by breakdown of the CS chain or during commercial
processing. Because sampling for this study took place 7 days postmortem,
some degradation might well have occurred, although it is difficult
to estimate to what degree since no such analysis has been made of
fresh salmon muscle and connective tissues for comparison. The cause
of such a high concentration of these trisaccharides does not appear
to be related to the connective tissue degradation causing gaping
as no significant difference was detected between their content in
intact and gaping tissues.

To our knowledge, no comparable quantitative
analysis of GAGs in
fish muscle has been reported. However, the relative CS dp2 distribution
detected in this study was considerably different from that detected
in other studies analyzing the CS content in various fish species,37,47−50 although these studies focused on other tissues such as bone, whole
embryo or adult, fins, swim bladder, and cartilage. The present CS
sulfation degree was much lower as nearly 40% of the CS disaccharides
were nonsulfated, while these other studies reported from undetectable
amounts to ∼33% at the most of nonsulfated CS disaccharides.
On the other hand, the relative content of disulfated CS disaccharides
was at a more comparable level to these other studies at around 8
to 10% (Table 2). There
were no significant differences detected in the relative distribution
of the three dp2 ion species when comparing all gaping and intact
samples (Table 2).

Pairwise Comparisons of Intra-Individual Gaping and Intact Tissue
Samples
Comparisons of the intact and gaping sample pairs
taken from the same individuals (n = 10) showed a
significant difference in the relative distribution of the dp2 phenotypes
(Table 3). Each dp2
phenotype was tested for discrimination between the two sample types
by the paired t-test and by the paired Wilcoxon test
(not shown). Both tests showed significant difference between intact
samples and gaping samples for all three dp2 phenotypes.

Comparisons of the measured CS amounts
showed significant difference
in the monosulfated dp2 [1,0,1,1,1] only (Table 3). Representative EICs of the dp2 phenotypes
for intact (Figure 2a) and gaping (Figure 2b) samples illustrate the relation between the peak sizes.

Figure 2 Representative
combined EICs of the three major CS disaccharide
compositions from (a) intact and (b) gaping tissues. Peak 1, disulfated
CS dp2 [1,0,1,2,1]; peak 2, monosulfated CS dp2 [1,0,1,1,1]; peak
2′, in source loss of SO3 from monosulfated CS;
peak 3, nonsulfated CS dp2 [1,0,1,0,1].

The comparisons of the relative dp2 values of the intact and gaping
sample pairs from each individual were illustrated in a dot plot showing
connections between the samples taken from the same individual (Figure 3). Intact samples
nearly always had lower relative content of nonsulfated CS dp2s compared
to gaping samples from the same individual and a higher relative content
of both mono- and disulfated CS dp2s.

Figure 3 Dot plot comparing the relative distribution
of the three CS disaccharide
compositions in intact (n = 10) and gaping (n = 10) sample pairs from the same individuals. The sample
pairs are illustrated with connecting lines.

This means that a difference was found in the CS sulfation degree
between intact and gaping samples from the same fillet, while no difference
was seen in total dp2 content or any CS saccharide other than the
monosulfated disaccharide. This indicates that CS in gaping tissue
has been more subject to desulfation. A higher degree of desulfation
but not degradation might suggest the action of endosulfatases. Although
the endogenous CS catabolism has not been fully established, the most
recognized path of CS degradation in vertebrates is by fragmentation
of the CS chain into oligosaccharides followed by sequential degradation
from the nonreducing end by exoglycosidases and sulfatases working
in tandem.51 A study showed that both total
CS content and CS4 were significantly reduced by higher galactosamine-4-sulfatase
levels in humans.52 Therefore, it might
be possible that the different degradation pattern in gaping tissue
is caused by bacterial endosulfatase activity.53 Many bacteria in the human intestines are capable of digesting
GAGs,54 and chondroitin sulfate 4-O-endosulfatases from marine bacteria have also been identified.55 These bacterial enzymes might potentially display
a higher activity or a wider range of CS-degrading pathways. To our
knowledge, no eukaryotic CS endosulfatases have yet been reported.
The bacterial CS 4-O endosulfatases can remove 4-O-sulfate from CS polysaccharide chains but are inhibited
by the 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc.55 This corresponds well with the findings in this study showing
that the differences between the singly sulfated and nonsulfated forms
in gaping and intact tissues are highly significant, while the difference
in relative content of the doubly sulfated CS disaccharides is less
significant (Table 3). An earlier study showed a correlation between intestinal fluids
and/or blood left in the abdominal cavity post-slaughter and a higher
degree of gaping.56 Potentially, bacteria
present in salmon intestines are capable of producing endosulfatases
acting on chondroitin sulfate. On the other hand, the desulfation
of CS polysaccharides by bacterial sulfatases might also promote the
digestion of CS by bacterial lyases, which could cause a difference
in CS content.

Alternatively, there could be some inherent variation
in the sulfation
degree in the connective tissue of the salmon fillets, leaving the
integrity of some areas more vulnerable to disintegration by the action
of sulfatases from the blood and/or intestinal fluids. Further research
into the CS desulfation potential of fish blood and intestinal bacteria
is needed to clarify any potential effect of these substances on the
connective tissue and chondroitin sulfate composition. Comparisons
to fresh tissue are also recommended.

Another implication of
these findings is that future research might
benefit from comparing samples from the same individuals over a time
period postmortem instead of comparing different individuals. The
results from this study imply that the total content and relative
distribution of CS dp2 in the tissue vary from individual to individual
and it might be difficult to find a specific threshold amount or dp2
distribution indicative of gaping tissue. On the other hand, the results
indicate that changes within the same individual are more informative.

Heparan Sulfate
The TICs of the HS samples showed some
noise (Figure 4a),
but as with CS, the BPC was better resolved (Figure 4b) and it was possible to quantify disaccharides
using the SEC-MS data. In addition, Figure 4 illustrates representative EICs of relatively
abundant HS Δ-unsaturated disaccharides (Figure 4c,d) and saturated disaccharides (Figure 4e,f).

(e) U2A0/U0A6 and (f) U0S0.

The amount of HS disaccharides measured after GAG extraction and
digestion by heparanase I, II, and III was, on average, 0.209 μg/mg
dried tissue. A similar amount of HS, 0.2 μg/mg dried tissue,
was detected in swim bladders of groupers (subfamily Epinephelinae).49 For comparison, there was 0.34 μg/mg sulfated
HS detected in rat muscle,39 while the
amounts detected in various defatted and dried murine tissue types
were between 0.120 and 3.30 μg/mg.57 As with the CS analysis, the HS values were compared between all
intact and gaping samples as well as between intact and gaping sample
pairs from the same individual (n = 10). An overview
of all HS dp2 compositions and ion species measured with m/z values and retention times can be found in Table S1. There was no difference detected in
the total amount of HS disaccharides recovered from intact and gaping
tissues by either comparison method (Table 4). In this study, the amount of CS dp2s detected
(Table 2) was 4.7 times
more abundant than that of HS dp2s (Table 4). A study of cod and wolffish, the first
prone to gaping and the other not,23 reported
that the sulfated CS/HS ratios in the fillets were 0.58 and 4.14,
respectively.24 However, these measurements
were performed using different techniques than applied in this study.

b Significant at p < 0.05.

The HS chain
length, which was calculated by dividing the total
amount of disaccharides with the saturated amount, was 14.09 dp2s
on average (Table 4), which is short compared to the 25–200 disaccharides considered
to be the common range.58 In comparison,
various tissue types in rat contained an HS chain length between ∼30
and 60 disaccharide units.27 It is difficult
to estimate to what extent the relatively short chain length is caused
by postmortem degradation as there are no data of this kind from live
or newly slaughtered fish. However, as the salmon was in storage for
7 days postmortem before sampling, it is likely that some degradation
has taken place. In addition, no significant differences were detected
in the HS chain length between intact and gaping tissues (Table 4). This indicates
that gaping is not caused by a difference in rate of the usual form
of degradation where HS chains are first cleaved into smaller fragments
by endo-β-glucuronidase followed by a well-ordered sequential
degradation including several enzymes. Endolytic heparanase activity
can cause shorter HS chains59 as they seem
to have larger affinity for cleaving glycosidic bonds closest to the
nonreducing end.60

The short chain
length was most likely also the reason that the
HS dp2 distribution detected in this study, as illustrated in Figure 5 using shorthand
description,61 was different and that the
HS sulfation degree (Table 4) was lower than that detected in other species and organs.27,42,47 HS chains are arranged in domains
of high sulfation, low sulfation, and mixed regions. The specific
arrangement of domains seems to be important for the function of HS.62 Salmon muscle might contain less sulfated HS
chains, or the comparatively low sulfation degree might be a reflection
of postmortem desulfation or loss of more densely sulfated regions
due to postmortem degradation. However, rat skeletal muscle has also
been demonstrated to have a relatively low sulfation degree of HS,
both internally in the chain and at the nonreducing end, compared
to various other organs.27 No significant
difference was detected in the overall sulfation degree of the HS
chains between gaping and intact tissues in our samples. However,
a significant difference was found in the Δ-unsaturated N-sulfation degree between intact and gaping tissues (p = 0.034) sampled from the same individual (n = 10). The gaping samples generally had a higher Δ-unsaturated N-sulfation degree. No difference was detected when comparing
all samples (Table 4).

Figure 5 Relative distribution of (a) Δ-unsaturated and (b) saturated
HS disaccharides in intact and gaping tissues. The HS dp2s are abbreviated
using the nomenclature described previously.63

Consistent with the findings of
others,42 there was a clear difference
in the sulfation pattern of the internal
chain and nonreducing end (Figure 5). The unsaturated HS disaccharides had a low level
of O-sulfation (Figure 5) as they were mainly nonsulfated (∼59.5%)
or just N-sulfated (∼26.5%), while the saturated
disaccharides had a much higher sulfation degree with only ∼19%
nonsulfated dp2s. Whether this is a reflection of the original chain
structure or it is due to postmortem degradation of the HS chains
is difficult to estimate. A comparison with fresh salmon tissue samples
is needed to clarify that issue.

From the saturated and unsaturated
dp2 distribution (Figure 5), it is also possible to estimate
the probability of where the various disaccharide phenotypes are positioned.
U2A6 dp2s are much more likely to be at the NRE than internally in
the chain. This is in stark contrast to various bovine and murine
organs,42 while some rat organs also show
this tendency, albeit to a lesser degree.27 In humans, the HS nonreducing end seems to be very important for
binding affinity of HS to fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), which
regulates, among other things, cell adhesion.63

Comparisons between NRE dp2 distribution and chain length
showed
a gradual change in the composition as the chain length increased
or decreased (Figure 6). The proportion of N-sulfated disaccharides at
the nonreducing end increases with increasing chain length, consistent
with findings of others.42 The three NRE
dp2 phenotypes, U0A0, U2A0/U0A2, and U2S0/U0S2, seem to have a correlated
pattern, while the other dp2 phenotypes do not seem to have a structured
pattern (data not shown). Interestingly, there is a difference between
intact and gaping samples in the stringency of this structure. While
the intact samples can be regressed to a trend line with R2 values between 0.44 and 0.77 (Figure 6a), the gaping samples are less uniform,
and the trend lines are less valid with R2 values between 0.05 and 0.56 (Figure 6b). Whether a larger variation in the HS chain structure
means a less organized and weaker connective tissue is uncertain but
might be worth the attention.

Figure 6 Distribution of HS disaccharides at the NRE
compared to chain length
for (a) intact and (b) gaping samples. Linear regression values for
(a) intact tissue were as follows: U0A0, R2 = 0.73, p < 0.0001; U2A0/U0A2, R2 = 0.44, p = 0.0094; U2S0/U0S2, R2 = 0.77, p < 0.0001. Linear
regression values for (b) gaping tissue were as follows: U0A0, R2 = 0.56, p < 0.0005; U2A0/U0A2, R2 = 0.05, p = 0.4103; U2S0/U0S2, R2 = 0.35, p < 0.0128.

Conclusions
There were significant
differences detected in the relative content
of CS dp2 phenotypes in gaping and intact tissue samples when comparing
samples taken from the same individual. The CS dp2s in gaping tissue
had a lower sulfation degree. In addition, the amount of singly sulfated
CS dp2 was significantly lower in gaping tissue. This difference in
CS sulfation degree could be due either to an inherent difference
in the tissue or endosulfatases in which bacteria are known to produce
because there was no difference in degradation of CS otherwise. The
HS analysis revealed overall short chain lengths potentially caused
by the action of endogenous heparanases. The only significant difference
in the HS structure between intact and gaping samples was that gaping
samples had a higher Δ-N-sulfation degree in
terms of the internal chain. Gaping samples also had a less uniform
chain structure. Further elucidation of reasons and implications of
these differences requires additional research including samples of
fresh tissue for comparison. Differences in the GAG structure between
intact and gaping tissues were mainly detected when comparing intact
and gaping samples taken from the same individuals. Potential threshold
values for GAG function failure in relation to gaping might thus be
difficult to ascertain for a species in general. Instead, it might
be beneficial for future research to compare postmortem time series
of samples from the same individuals.

Experimental Section
Samples
Thirty farmed Atlantic salmon were kindly provided
by the farming company Luna (Faroe Islands). The salmon, taken at
an aquaculture facility during normal slaughtering procedures, were
∼2.5 years of age and had an average weight of 4.2 kg. All
salmon were from the same net pen and had experienced the same conditions
from fry to slaughter. None of the salmon had reached maturity. The
30 salmon were used in a postmortem experimental setup (detailed in
ref (64)) for analyzing
the effect of cleaning of the abdomen and initial storage temperature
in the presence of gaping. After 7 days in cold storage, all 30 salmon
were evaluated for the presence of gaping. At the same time, one gaping
and/or one intact tissue sample was taken from each of the 30 salmon
(n = 43). The samples consisted of connective tissue,
myocommata, and the adjacent muscle tissue. Illustrations of intact
and gaping fillets as well as sampling area are provided in Figure S1. The samples were stored at −18
°C and later homogenized into powder while frozen by sterile
mortar and pestle. The samples were subsequently lyophilized.

Reagents
Heparin lyases I, II, and III from Flavobacterium
heparinum were purchased from Ibex
Pharmaceuticals (Montreal, Canada). Chondroitinase ABC from Proteus vulgaris and benzonase were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Pronase was purchased from Roche
Applied Science.

GAG Extraction
GAGs were extracted
from dry tissue
(∼60 mg) of the 43 samples by a slightly modified version of
the extraction procedure previously described.27 The tissue was suspended in 0.75 mL of protein digest buffer
(50 mM Tris/HCl (pH ≈ 8), 1 mM CaCl2, 1% Triton
X-100) and incubated with end-over-end mixing for 48 h at 55 °C.
Pronase (1 mg/sample) was added initially and again after 24 h. Following
heat inactivation of pronase by suspending the sample tubes into boiling
water for 5 min, the buffer was adjusted to 2 mM MgCl2.
Benzonase (400 mg/sample) was added, and samples were incubated at
37 °C for 3 h. Then, the samples were adjusted to 0.5 M NaOH
and incubated overnight with end-over-end mixing at 4 °C. Thereafter,
the samples were acidified with acetic acid to pH ≈ 5.5 and
centrifuged at 15.000g for 15 min. The supernatants
were transferred to new tubes, and 3 mL of MilliQ water was added.
DEAE-Sephacel columns were prepared for GAG purification by adding
2.0 mL of slurry (Sigma-Aldrich) to the 10 mL columns (Bio-Rad) with
frits only at the bottom. The resins were flushed with 10 mL of 0.1
M NaCl and 20 mM NaOAc (pH = 6.0) and eluted by gravity. The samples
were added and washed with 25 mL of the same solution. The samples
were since eluted, and GAGs were recovered by eluting with 2.5 mL
of 1 M NaCl and 29 mM NaOAc (pH = 6.0). For desalting, PD-10 (GE Healthcare)
columns and buffer reservoirs were washed with 30 mL of MilliQ water
before the samples were added and eluted by gravity with 3.5 mL of
MilliQ water. Each of the eluted samples was divided into two tubes
and freeze-dried overnight for further analysis.

GAG Digestion
CS and HS were chosen for MS analysis
as these are the most abundant GAGs in the muscle connective tissue
that otherwise has a low concentration of GAGs. Forty percent of the
total extracted GAG pool was digested with heparin lyases I, II, and
III, targeting heparan sulfate, while 15% was digested with chondroitinase
ABC, targeting chondroitin sulfate. Each of the two tubes with extracted
and dried GAG pool samples was rehydrated with 5.0 μL of H2O. For HS digestion, 4.0 μL of GAG pool was incubated
at 37 °C for 24 h with 0.5 μL of 100 mM Ca(OAc)2, 2.0 μL of 100 mM Tris/HCl (pH = 7.4), and 7.0 μL of
a mixture of HS lyases I, II, and III. For CS digestion, 1.5 μL
of GAG pool was incubated at 37 °C for 24 h with 1.0 μL
of 100 mM NH4OAc, 3.0 μL of 100 mM Tris/HCl (pH =
8.0), and 6.5 μL of CH ABC. Because digested GAGs can be separated
from GAG polysaccharides with size exclusion chromatography used in
connection with LC–MS, no further treatment was needed. A simplified
overview of GAG extraction and digestion is provided in Figure S2. For optimal use of laboratory facilities,
some of the extracted GAG samples were pooled in equivalent amounts,
resulting in a final sample size of n = 32 for SEC-LC/MS
analysis (Table 5).
Pooled samples were of either gaping or intact tissue and from fish
within the same experimental group and with the same gaping classification.64 Pooling of samples was performed without interfering
with the possibility of comparing intact and gaping tissue samples
from the same individual.

Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry
Analysis
For the disaccharide analysis of HS and CS, the
technical design
of the SEC-LC/MS system used was the same as reported by Shi and Zaia.27 The mobile phase (12.5 mM formic acid, pH adjusted
to 4.4 by ammonia, in 10% acetonitrile) was delivered isocratically
at 0.015 mL/min. Disaccharides and oligosaccharides eluting from the
SEC column were analyzed using the Applied Biosystems QSTAR Pulsar-I
(Q-ToF) mass spectrometer operating in negative polarity using the
enhanced mode. The MS analyses were performed with an internal standard
(ΔHexA2S-GlcNS6S), making quantification possible. HS and CS
saccharides were identified according to m/z values and retention times, as described.27 Throughout the HS and CS analyses, 10 randomly chosen samples
were run in triplicate to confirm consistent technical performance.

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were
performed using R (http://www.r-project.org). The significance level was set at p-values below
0.05. Welch’s t-test65 was used when comparing all gaping and intact tissue samples (n = 32). The paired t-test66 and paired Wilcoxon test,67 a
distribution-free method that replaces the data with corresponding
order statistics, were applied to all pairwise comparisons of HS and
CS measurements from gaping (n = 10) and intact (n = 10) sample pairs taken from the same 10 individuals.
