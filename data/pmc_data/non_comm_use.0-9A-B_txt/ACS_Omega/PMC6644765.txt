A thin
film of poly(o-aminophenol), POAP, has been used
as a sensor for various types of toxic and nontoxic gases: a gateway
between the digital and physical worlds. We have carried out a systematic
mechanistic investigation of POAP as a humidity sensor; how does it
sense different gases? POAP has several convenient features such as
flexibility, transparency, and suitability for large-scale manufacturing.
With an appropriate theoretical method, molecular oligomers of POAP,
NH and O functional groups and the perpendicular side of the polymeric
body, are considered as attacking sites for humidity sensing. It is
found that the NH position of the polymer acts as an electrophilic
center: able to accept electronic cloud density and energetically
more favorable compared to the O site. The O site acts as a nucleophilic
center and donates electronic cloud density toward H2Ovap.
In conclusion, only these two sites are involved in the sensing process
which leads to strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, having a 1.96
Å bond distance and ΔE ∼ −35
kcal mol–1. The results suggest that the sensitivity
of the sensor improved with the oxidization state of POAP.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Conducting polymers (CPs)
are becoming an active field of research which has brought a dynamic
revolution in the field of chemistry, physics, and engineering in
the last several decades.1 Electrical conductance
along the tailorable structure of CPs, followed by optical and electronic
properties, has proven their potential application in a large number
of organic electronics such as batteries,2 fuel cells,3,4 solar cells,5 light emitting diodes,6 supercapacitors,7 and optical displays.8,9 The
most widely used CPs are polyaniline (PANI),10 polypyrrole (PPy),11 polythiophene (PT),12 poly(o-phenylenediamine)
(POPD),13 and poly(o-aminophenol)
(POAP).14

Besides these technological
applications, CPs are getting a valuable position in the design of
gas sensing devices. Humidity control is a grand challenge in various
sensitive industries such as packed food, storage of drugs, preventing
different antiques and paintings, agricultural uses, and in environmental
control.15−17 Although humidity sensors are available in the market,
based on dew point,18 catalysis,19,20 infrared,21 and inorganic semiconductor
(Ti, Zn) sensors,19,22 most of them require high operation
temperature, show deviation from the linear response, and create problems
in reversibility. Cost maintenance and high power consumption restrict
their viability and versatility.23 Lots
of research is in progress to overcome these drawbacks and develop
an effective material for humidity sensing.

One of the best
options is to replace other inorganic materials with flexible CPs.
CPs are stable and cheap, require low operational temperature, have
low weight, and are easily synthesizable with good reversibility and
tailorable properties; this make them prominent compared to other
inorganic materials.1,24−27 Some of the most commonly used
CPs in the field of humidity sensing are PANI,28−30 POPD,31,32 and PPy,33−35 which have been used in different oxidation states.
Furthermore, they are either employed in pure, blended, or in composites
form with other inorganic materials to enhance their sensitivity,
flexibility, and selectivity.36 Scientists
are investigating varieties of CPs to be the best humidity sensing
materials, but they are facing numerous issues such as formation of
a nonuniform, unstable, and adhesive film on the electrode.17 POAP is a redox conducting polymer with the
unique ability to have a uniform, stable, and adhesive film formation
besides its other electroactive properties.37 POAP is a substituted derivative of PANI, where the structure has
two potentially active sites (NH and O positions) for the interaction
of H2Ovap and other related gases. It is recently reported
that a modified POAP film has improved sensing properties, compared
to other CPs.38−40 Although POAP has been experimentally reported as
a sensor, no one has paid attention to its mechanistic study; which
functional group is more sensitive and how does it attract gas particles?

In this work, we employed density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent
(TD) DFT simulations at various level of theories to find out the
best method for precise correlation of theory with the already experimental
evidence of POAP. Molecular oligomers of POAP, both reduced and oxidized,
with different chain lengths are considered where the NH and O functional
groups and perpendicular sides of the polymeric body are considered
as attacking sites toward humidity sensing. The sensing phenomenon
is investigated from structural distortion (change in geometric parameters),
intermolecular interaction energies, natural bonding orbital analysis
(NBO), and electronic property simulations such as HOMO, LUMO, density
of states, band gap, electrostatic potential, and UV–vis spectral
analysis. Moreover, the current theoretical investigation of POAP,
combined with the already reported behavior of POAP, will lead to
the fabrication of a proficient and competent humidity and other related
gas sensor.

2 Results and Discussions
a Selection
of Level of Theory
DFT analysis at various levels of theory
is carried on the symmetrical 3PAOP (Figure 1) to find the best, inexpensive method for
precisely correlating the theory with experiment. Results of ten different
levels of theory on the symmetrical 3POAP are listed in Table 1, which led us to conclude that
B3LYP/6-31G(d) is the best regarding both the computational time and
accuracy points of view.

a Using 3POAP as a model at fixed memory of 10 GB and 4 processors.

DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory not only reproduces the experimental band gap41,42 but is very fast and cheap regarding the computational point of
view. The difference of 0.28 eV between the experimental and simulated
band gap is due to the fact that the observed one was from the thin
film while the calculation is that of the gas phase.

b Selection of Proper Interacting System(s)
i Optimized
Geometric Parameters
Geometry optimization of all these species
has been performed using DFT at the 6-31G (d) level of theory. The
sensing potential of nPOAP toward water vapors (H2Ovap) is estimated from the geometrical distortion
of the polymeric backbone, interacting with water vapor(s). These
parameters include intermolecular distance, intermolecular bond length,
bond angles, and dihedral angles of POAP. Optimized geometries of
4POAP and their complexes with H2O at different sides have
been shown in Figures 2 and S1–3, while their different
geometric parameters are listed in Table 2. We have selected different models to find
the best interaction between H2O and 4POAP, where the H2O either interacts at NH (Figure 1), O (Figure S1), perpendicular to the backbone (Figure S2), or considering both the NH and O sides of 4POAP (Figure S3). Results and discussion of the latter two interacting
systems show that instead of interaction with the polymeric body of
4POAP, water molecules hydrogen bond among themselves, as can be seen
from Figures S2 and S3 of the Supporting Information. So, the overall interaction in these species is comparatively low
as that of H2O attached at NH or O functional groups. In
case of the 4POAP_NH@H2O system, one, two, and three NH
sites of 4POAP were alternatively covered with H2O and
it was found that the O of H2O makes an intermolecular
bond of about 1.95 Å with the H of NH in all these complexes.

9	4POAP@6H2O	–59.05	–0.050	3.73	3.58 (0.30)	
A similar but less pronounced intermolecular hydrogen bonding
is observed in 4POAP_O@H2O systems (Figure S1), where the H-bonding is because of the H of H2O and O of the O site of 4POAP backbone. In summary, both
the NH and O sites of 4POAP has a strong interaction with water vapor
as can be seen from the strong H-bonding and its distorted geometric
structure (Figures 1 and S1).

ii Interaction
Energy, NBO Charge, and Electronic Properties
As a universal
solvent, water act as either a proton donor or a proton acceptor which
directly depends on the other reactant. In acids/bases, the proton
is that of the H+ ion so, water acts as a proton donor
when it reacts with a base; however, it accepts proton when it reacts
with an acid. A similar situation is observed, on considering NH and
O sites of POAP for water vapor. In the case of H···O,
where the H of H2O react with O of POAP oligomer which
withdraw the electronic cloud density of 0.012 e– from its backbone. On considering two H2O molecules for
the O site of 4POAP, water vapor withdraws about 0.014 e– of charge, and 0.025 e– in the case of three H2O. When water vapor was reacted at the NH sites of 4POAP,
it donates electronic cloud density toward the polymer as can be seen
from Table 2. 4POAP
has withdrawn a charge about 3-fold greater than the NBO charge compared
to the O site of POAP. On considering the perpendicular attachment
of water vapors, a less pronounced situation is observed where H2O withdraws electronic cloud density of 0.008 e–. In this interaction, water molecules circulate around the polymeric
body and search for either O or NH groups and forms intermolecular
H-bonding through self-interaction. Finally, both NH and O sites of
4POAP were covered with H2O, where water vapors accept
electronic cloud density from polymer. This intermolecular charge
transfer is inbetween those of the individual O and NH interacting
systems but is still a very good interaction. The reason behind this
is that one group acts as an electron donator while the other accepts
as electronic cloud densities which minimize the net charge exchange.

As discussed
earlier, H2O vapor reacts with POAP backbone via either
NH or O sites with strong hydrogen bonding. In the case of 4POAP_O@1H2O, this intermolecular hydrogen bond distance is −8.22
kcal mol–1, which increases upon increasing the
number of water vapors, −14.93 kcal mol–1 in @2H2O, and −21.96 kcal mol–1 in the case of the 4POAP_O@3H2O system (Table 2). So, a linear response in
interaction energy is observed with number of water vapors. A very
similar intermolecular interaction energy is observed in the case
of 4POAP_NH@nH2O systems (Table 2), but here the intermolecular interaction
is due to O of H2O and H of the NH side of the polymer.
A −9.03 kcal mol–1 interaction energy is
simulated for one water vapor, −16.44 kcal mol–1, for two, and −24.03 kcal mol–1, for three,
attached to 4POAP. In contrast to the small charge transfer, a good
interaction energy of −32 kcal mol–1 is simulated
between the perpendicularly attached water vapors at a backbone of
4POAP (4POAP_|@3H2O). On covering all the functional groups
(both O and NH) of 4POAP with water vapors, a comparatively higher
intermolecular interaction energy of −59.05 kcal mol–1 is observed as can be seen from Table 2. But again, the charge transfer is low and
the net behavior is an average of O and NH interacting systems. This
comparatively higher interaction energy is because of high number
of water vapors while the lower charge exchange (−0.05 e–) is due to the self-interaction and intermolecular
hydrogen bonding among H2O vapors. As explained earlier,
the perpendicularly attached H2O vapors tend to minimize
themselves near the O and NH functional groups of 4POAP. So, both
the O and NH are responsible for the sensing of H2O vapors.
Furthermore, an electrostatic potential map of these four different
interacting systems is given in Figure 3, where the electrophilic and nucleophilic sites can
be seen as red and blue region, respectively.

Figure 3 Electrostatic potential
map of 4POAP_O@H2O (a), 4POAP_NH@H2O (b), 4POAP_|@H2O (c), and 4POAP@6H2O (d).

We
have also carried out UV–vis absorption spectroscopy for all
these four-interacting species, which is given in Figure 4 along with the parent 4POAP
as a reference. Three distinct absorption band peaks are simulated
in the hydrogen terminated 4POAP; at ca. 427, 361, and 251 nm. The
broad absorption band peak at ca. 251 nm has a strong correlation
with experimentally reported λ = 258 nm43,44 which can be assigned to the π → π* transition
of the aromatic benzene unit. On interacting water vapor(s) with 4POAP,
all these prominent band peaks are blue-shifted as can be seen from Figure 4 and Table 2. So, water vapor act as a reducing
agent which can be seen from the hypsochromic shift in the UV–vis
spectra of 4POAP. The HOMO–LUMO band gap of hydrogen terminated
4POAP is 3.54 eV while its first allowed electronic excitation energy
is 3.42 eV, as listed in Table 2. The later can be regarded as an optical band gap while the
first one is known as electrical band gap. Upon interaction of H2O vapor at the O side of 4POAP, the band gap elongates and
a blue-shifting occurred in the first allowed excitation energy (Table 2). A similar but less
pronounced behavior is simulated in case of 4POAP_NH@nH2O systems, where n is the number of
H2O vapors. In these four-interaction systems, the trend
of band gap elongation and blue shifting of first allowed electronic
excitation energy is because of H2O vapor(s). So, water
vapor(s) cause a hpsochromic shift in POAP; attached either at O,
NH, |, or all sides of POAP. So, UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
will be the best tool in investigating the humidity sensing behavior
of POAP and its oligomers.

Figure 4 Electronic
excitation spectra of 4POAP, where H2O molecules interact
at different sites.

As reported by Jeffery
et al. 2.2–2.5 Å of hydrogen bonding will be “strong
or mostly covalent”, 2.5–3.2 Å will be “moderate,
mostly electrostatic”, while 3.2–4.0 Å is described
as “weak, mostly electrostatic”. The bonding energy
for the strong one should be in the range of −40 to −14
kcal mol–1, for the moderate, −15 to −4
kcal mol–1, and for the weak, <− 4 kcal
mol–1.45

In summary,
POAP senses or reacts to water vapor either at O, NH, or both sites
by establishing strong hydrogen (mostly covalent) bonding, although
both functional groups have opposite (in term of electron/proton transferring
phenomena) but systematic effects. So, the sensing efficiency of the
experimentally prepared thin film of POAP and its oligomer will strongly
depend on the free availability of O and NH functional groups. Whether
the H2O vapors are in line or perpendicular to its backbone,
the reacting sites will be O, NH, or both.

c Noncovalent Interaction of Water Vapors at the O Site of nPOAP
After predicting the proper orientation of
humidity sensing, different oligomeric chain length of POAP (both
reduced and oxidized states) are opted for further simulations. In
case of nPOAP_O@H2O (where n = 2, 4, ..., 10), all available O sites were covered with water
vapors. Interaction energy, NBO charge, band gap, and first allowed
excitation energy of the respective nPOAP_O@H2O systems are listed in Table 3. Analysis of the data of Table 3 led us to conclude that water vapor interaction
energy with nPOAP is about −7 kcal mol–1 per water, where the O of nPOAP
donates electronic cloud density toward H2O. Upon interaction
of H2O vapor with nPOAP, band gap and
first allowed excitation energy of the resulted complexes increase
which is a direct consequence of H2O adsorption (vide supra).

Table 3 Interaction Energy
(kcal mol–1), NBO Charge (e–),
Band Gap (eV), and First Allowed Excitation Energy of nPOAP_O@H2O Systems

3	4POAP	 	 	3.76	3.52

8	8POAP_O@H2O	–48.65	0.08	3.28	3.28	
9	10POAP	 	 	3.22	3.19	
10	10POAP_O@H2O	–61.99	0.10	3.23	3.23	
So, along with chain length elongation
of POAP, intermolecular interaction energy, NBO charge, band gap,
and first allowed electronic excitation energy changes/increases linearly.
The HOMO and LUMO energy levels of parent nPOAP and nPOAP_O@H2O are simulated from the density of
state (DOS) plots, which are comparatively given in Figure 5. Water vapors change the position
of HOMO and LUMO levels of all nPOAP.

Figure 5 DOS of nPOAP along with nPOAP_O@H2O.

To confirm and elaborate the humidity sensing nature
of nPOAP, UV–vis absorption spectra in the
range of 100–600 nm were simulated at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory. As explained earlier, nPOAP gives rise
to three distinct absorption band peaks. With increasing oligomeric
chain length, the third shoulder peak disappears and broadens and
shifts the high-energy absorption band peak (∼250 nm) toward
the visible range (low energy region). UV–vis absorption spectra
of the reduced nPOAP are given in Figure 6 along with nPOAP_O@H2O systems.

Figure 6 UV–vis absorption spectra of nPOAP (top) and nPOAP_O@H2O
(bottom).

Analysis of the results of Figure 6 and Table 3 led us to conclude that all
the absorption band peaks of parent nPOAP are sufficiently
blue-shifted upon interaction of water vapors which confirm the strong
sensing behavior of POAP. This is further supported by the interaction
energy, NBO charge, and band gap alteration.

Generally, COPs are positively charged when experimentally
synthesized and the cationic form is more reactive than their counterpart
neutral state. So, we considered a monocationic nPOAP without doping agent using UB3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory.
As expected, nPOAP+ has stronger intermolecular
interaction energy with H2O compared to that of their reduced nPOAP. The simulated interaction energy is almost double
while a similar trend in band gap and first allowed electronic excitation
energy is observed. Alteration in band gap and HOMO/LUMO levels of
both parent and interacting systems are simulated from DOS, which
are given in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information. Interestingly, the charge transferring phenomena is in the opposite
direction to that of its reduced form of nPOAP_O@H2O systems. All nPOAP+ has withdrawn
electronic cloud density from water molecules as can be seen from Figure 7 and Table 4. In Figure 7, an electrostatic potential map (ESP) of
the reduced and cationic form of nPOAP along with
water vapors is given. Different colors are used as a symbol for different
values of electrostatic potential; red and blue colors show electron
rich and electron deficient (high positivity) regions of the species
whereas the green color shows the region of zero potential. A neutral
electrostatic potential map for nPOAP, a nucleophilic
one for nPOAP_O@H2O, and a slightly electrophilic
one for nPOAP+_O@H2O can be
clearly seen from the electrostatic potential map (Figure 7). On interacting H2O vapors with nPOAP, its backbone becomes more electropositive
due to the acceptance of proton from H2O and the corner
(especially H2O attached sides) turned dark yellow (more
electronegative).

(both neutral and cationic) along with nPOAP_NH@H2O and nPOAP_O@H2O systems.

The proton acceptance/donating
ability of water from nPOAP and nPOAP+ can also be confirmed from their ESP plots. Both
electrostatic potential map and NBO charge analysis strongly corroborate
each other (vide supra). The UV–vis and UV–vis-near
IR spectra of the cationic species along with water vapors are simulated
at TD-DFT with UB3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. Comparative UV–vis-near
IR absorption spectra of nPOAP+_O@H2O systems are given in Figure 8, along with that of parent nPOAP+. Oxidized nPOAP has strong UV–vis
absorption band peaks in the visible and near IR regions, compared
to that of reduced ones. This band shifting to the red or near IR
region is because of the formation of a polaronic state, responsible
for the high electroactivity. All the absorption band peaks of nPOAP+ blue shift on interacting with water vapors,
which are clearly described in Table 4. As discussed in earlier sections, this blue shifting
in the absorption band peaks of nPOAP+ is due to the interaction of H2O.

spectra of nPOAP+ (top) and nPOAP+_O@H2O (bottom).

d Noncovalent Interaction of Water Vapors at the
NH Site of nPOAP
In order to analyze the
sensing behavior of the NH site in nPOAP (both reduced
and oxidized), different oligomers are opted for interaction energy,
NBO charge, band gap, ESP, and UV–vis spectral characteristics.
A comparatively higher intermolecular interaction energy is estimated
in case of nPOAP_NH@H2O to that of nPOAP_O@H2O systems as can be seen from Table 5. The simulated interaction
energy for 2POAP_NH@H2O is −7.65 kcal mol–1, −23.03 kcal mol–1 for 4POAP_NH@H2O, 38.34 kcal mol–1 for 6POAP_NH@H2O,
−50.46 kcal mol–1 for 8POAP_NH@H2O, and 68.58 kcal mol–1 for 10POAP_NH@H2O systems. In contrast to the O@H2O interaction, the nature
of NH@H2O is totally different in the case of proton/electron
transferring phenomena. Here the NH side of nPOAP
acts as a proton donor, which means the electronic cloud density moves
to nPOAP and results an anionic state. This high
interaction energy and charge transferring are responsible for strong
hydrogen bonding (H–O) between H of NH and O of H2O in all nPOAP_NH@H2O systems. Compared
to nPOAP_O@H2O systems, here the amount
of charge transfer is 3-fold which make the nPOAP
backbone more nucleophilic and H2O vapor more electrophilic.
This phenomenon can be clearly seen from the ESP plots (Figure 7) where the yellowish region
depicts the electronegative nature and the bluish is that of electropositive
character (H2O sides). This time, the band gap and first
allowed electronic excitation energy decrease upon interaction with
H2O vapors as can be seen from Table 5. So, here water act as an oxidizing agent
which finally validate the acid/base chemistry of water in different
reagents (vide supra).

The band gap of 2POAP decreases
from 4.45 to 4.34 eV, a decrease of 0.13 eV in 4POAP, 0.08 eV in 6POAP,
0.12 eV in 8POAP, and again a decrease of 0.12 eV in 10POAP is observed
upon sensing H2O vapors. The shifting of HOMO and LUMO
energy levels in nPOAP after interacting with H2O are also very prominent as can be seen from the DOS plot,
given in Figure 9.
These band shiftings are clear evidence toward the high sensitivity
of nPOAP for H2O vapors. Moreover, UV–vis
absorption spectra of all these interacting species are simulated
which are comparatively given in Figure 10 along with isolated nPOAP.
Absorption band peaks of all nPOAP are red-shifted
upon interaction with H2O, as can be seen from Table 5 and Figure 10. Water vapor has increased
the visible light absorption capability of all POAP oligomers (shift
the λmax to lower energy region) which further supports
and confirms POAP as the best sensor for humidity.

Figure 9 DOS of nPOAP along with nPOAP_NH@H2O.

Figure 10 UV–vis absorption spectra of nPOAP (top) and nPOAP_NH@H2O (bottom).

Again, comparatively higher intermolecular
interaction energies are observed in all nPOAP+_NH@H2O systems, which are listed in Table 6. In contrast to the reduced
state, here water vapors have caused a blue-shifting in all the oxidized
oligomers of POAP. This behavior in all POAP+ oligomers
can be analyzed from the blue shifting of UV–vis and UV–vis-near
IR absorption band peaks (Figure 11). Being a universal species, water interacts with
POAP either in reduced or oxidized state. For clarity reasons, the
first allowed electronic excitation band peaks of all these isolated
and H2O interacting nPOAP+ systems
are listed in Table 6. However, the charge transferring phenomena is in the same direction
as that of nPOAP_NH@H2O systems but more
prominent. In the case of a reduced state (nPOAP),
the electronic cloud density was moved to nPOAP due
to NH functional groups (electrophilic nature). Here the proton donating
nature of nPOAP+ toward H2O
vapors is because of the oxidized state (cationic form). So, upon
interaction with H2O vapors, the oxidized states are reduced
as can be visualized from the ESP plot (Figure 7), band gap enlargement, and shifting of
HOMO/LUMO levels (Figure S5).

The opposite interacting nature of O and NH functional
groups with H2O vapors can be precisely seen from Figure 12, where the red
and blue-shifting of λmax is shown. So, water vapor
can be detected at either site (O, NH, or both) of POAP. The strong
humidity sensing ability of POAP is stem to the free availability
of these two functional groups which simultaneously act as a proton
donor/acceptor agents, followed by redox chemistry of H2O.

3 Conclusion
The prominent nature of poly(o-aminophenol) (PAOP)
among all CPs is because of its redox conducting nature, ladderlike
molecular structure, and availability of more reactive sites such
as O and NH functional groups on its polymeric backbone. Due to the
free availability of these functional groups, POAP can be used as
a best candidate for gas sensing. We have carried out a systematic
theoretical study for a POAP gas sensor; considering its O and NH
functional groups as attacking sites for H2O vapors. For
theoretical simulations, DFT and time-dependent DFT simulations are
performed at the various level of theories. DFT at the B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory is found to be the best method for theoretical study
of PAOP and its interacting systems with different analytes. In summary,
POAP both in reduced and oxidized states has strong sensing ability
toward H2O vapors which is estimated from good interaction
energy, as a consequence the strong hydrogen bonding is more likely
covalent. Furthermore, structural distortion (change in geometric
parameters), charge exchange, shifting of HOMO and LUMO levels, band
gap alteration, and perturbation in UV–vis spectra absorption
band peaks of POAP upon interacting with H2O validate its
sensing ability. Finally, if one side of POAP acts as a proton donor
then the other will act as a proton acceptor, which further strengthens
its intermolecular interaction; however, the NH position of the polymer
is energetically favorable compared to the O site toward H2Ovap. It is concluded that H2O is responsible
for blue-shifting in λmax of POAP UV–vis spectra,
so color change in the thin film of POAP may be a direct method for
detection.

4 Computational Methods
The ground-state
geometries of nPOAP oligomers (where n = 2, 4, ..., 10) were simulated using hybrid DFT at the B3LYP functional
(Becke three parameter, Lee, Yang, and Parr)46 with the 6-31G(d) basis set. B3LYP and its unrestricted formulism,
such as UB3LYP, are used for the reduced (POAP) and oxidized (POAP+) form of POAP, respectively.47 From the last two decades, this level of theory has been proven
to accurately describe π-conjugated systems such as CPs and
other conjugated materials.48−50 All calculations were performed
using Gaussian 09,51 while the results
are analyzed through Gabedit52 and Gauss
view.53 Prior to sensor study of nPOAP, its symmetrical trimer (hydrogen terminated) is employed
for the testing of an appropriate level of theory. Molecular gas phase
H2O is considered as water vapors. Water vapors are interacted
at the NH and O sites and perpendicular to the polymeric backbone
of 4POAP, considering both reduced and oxidized states. After the
systematic study, nPOAP (nPOAP and nPOAP+) is interacted with water vapors. POAP+ oligomers either isolated or in complex state (nPOAP+@H2O) are positively charged with doublet
spin, and the simulations were performed at the UB3LYP/6-31G(d) level
of theory. No symmetry constraint was applied during geometry optimization.54 Harmonic frequency calculations were performed
to confirm the optimized structures with no negative frequencies.
Intermolecular interaction energies were also simulated to study the
interaction behavior of polymer with H2O. This was further
confirmed by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis. Frontier molecular
orbitals such as highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), and their respective band gap
calculations were also carried out at the mentioned level of theory.
UV–vis absorption spectra are also simulated to understand
the sensing behavior of polymers. Both the gas phase and solvent media
of acetonitrile using polarized continuum model (PCM) are employed.
In case of POAP oligomers, both solvent and gas phase UV–vis
spectra were almost similar (see Figure S6), so, in order to reduce the computational cost, the gas phase simulations
are considered. Finally, the oligomeric properties were extrapolated
to obtain polymeric properties through a second-order polynomial fit
equation.55
