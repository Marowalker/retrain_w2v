A triazole-derivatized, spiro-indoline-linked,
1,3-di-derivative
of calix[4]arene (L) has been synthesized to take advantage
of its ion-binding capability in the ring-open form. Indeed, the spiro-indoline
moiety is well known for its photochromic, acidochromic, and metallochromic
properties. Therefore, the L has been explored for Cu2+ binding, cell imaging, and anticancer activity of the corresponding
complex since Cu2+ complexes are known for such activity.
The conversion from the closed to open form of L is expedited
by light or proton, while the metal ion can open as well as stabilize
it. The open form of L showed binding of Cu2+ ratiometrically as demonstrated by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy.
This leads to the formation of 1:1 complex with a binding constant
of (6.9 ± 2.3) × 105 M–1, with
the lowest detection limit being 1.9 nM. In the complex, the Cu2+ is bound by two triazole-N and two phenolic-O groups resulting
in a distorted tetrahedral coordination core of CuN2O2 as demonstrated based on density functional theory studies.
To form such coordination core, the arms underwent considerable changes
in some of the dihedral angles. The binding of Cu2+ to L induces self-assembly of L by varying from
simple particles to rodlike structures when bound to Cu2+. The on–off fluorescence intensity of L and
its Cu2+-bound species are responsible for imaging cancer
cells. The L shows red fluorescence in MDA-MB-231 cancer
cells by targeting mitochondria as proved based on the colocalization
study carried out using MitoTracker Green. While the L alone is nontoxic to cancer cells, the presence of Cu2+ brings cell death to an extent of 90% with an IC50 value
of 165 nM by bringing a substantial quench in the fluorescence of L. A shift of population from G0/G1 and
G2M phases to the Sub-G1 phase was observed
as the concentration of the complex was increased, indicating cell
death as studied by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Thus, the
present work clearly proved that a calix[4]arene functionalized at
the lower rim with spiro-indoline moieities when complexed with Cu2+ acts as an efficient anticancer agent and is capable of
imaging cancer cells.

Introduction
Calix[4]arene platform
is well known in the literature for its
ease of functionalization at its upper and lower rims.1,2 The resulting derivatives of calix[4]arene have been developed for
various applications, such as host–guest interactions,3−7 metal-ion8−11 and anion sensing,12 and drug delivery.13,14 Spiro-indoline-based systems are known for their acido-, solvato-,
thermo-, and photochromic behaviors.15−17 Derivatives possessing
spiro-indoline moieties were reported to have anticancer properties.18 Although the pyridinium moieties are known for
their mitochondrial targeting ability,19 the quaternary nitrogen-containing spiro-indoline derivatives have
not been explored in this direction. It is interesting to understand
the anticancer activity of such groups when anchored onto the calix[4]arene
platform, in particular when the same is bound to Cu2+ since
copper complexes are well proven to be anticancer agents as reported
in the literature.20−22 Therefore, a lower-rim di-spiro-indoline-derivatized
calix[4]arene has been synthesized (L), characterized,
and explored for its Cu2+-ion binding, followed by isolation,
characterization, cell imaging, and anticancer activities of the Cu2+ complex. In L, the spiro-indoline ring acts
as the fluorescent probe and also binds to Cu2+ in its
open form and the resultant complex further exhibits anticancer activity.

Results
and Discussion
The L was synthesized by the
condensation reaction
of P3 with P4, while P3 is obtained from the click reaction carried out between the di-alkyne
derivative, P1, with the azide
derivative, P2, according to Scheme 1. All of the products,
including the precursors, were characterized by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry
(ESI-MS) (Figures S01–S05).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Precursors and the Final Molecule, L
(a) CuSO4·5H2O, sodium ascorbate, t-butanol/CH2Cl2/H2O (1:1:2), room temperature (RT), 1.5
days; (b) ethanol, piperidine, reflux, 1 day; (c) methyl iodide, acetonitrile,
inert atmosphere, reflux, 0.5 days.

Closed and
Open Forms of L in Solution
The L exhibits three major absorption bands centered
at 202, 292, and 379 nm in acetonitrile and a major emission band
at 475 nm with a strong shoulder at 570 nm when excited at 379 nm
(excitation spectrum of L given in Figure S09). The spiro-indoline system is known to undergo
ring opening,16 which is further expected
to be stabilized by a transition-metal ion. Addition of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) to L leads to the transformation of the closed
ring form to that of the ring-open form, which was evident from the
observed increase in the absorbance at 420 nm. The open form also
exhibits increase in the emission intensity at 570 nm band in fluorescence
spectra at the cost of the band at 475 nm, and the changes follow
ratiometrically (Figure 1a,b). Similar results were seen in the literature for coumarin- and
quinoline-conjugated spiro-pyran derivatives, wherein the ring opening
was induced by TFA and metal ions, respectively.15−17

Cu2+ Binding to L in Solution
The binding of Cu2+ to L in acetonitrile
was explored by measuring the absorption spectra during the titration
of the open form of L using Cu2+, which resulted
in increasing the absorbance of 420 nm band at the expense of the
band at 290 nm, and all of this results in an isosbestic point at
333 nm (Figure 2a,b,
insets) supporting the formation of the complex between L and Cu2+ as expected. The Job plot executed using these
data yielded 1:1 complex between Cu2+ and L (Figure S10). These data yielded an association
constant, Ka = (6.9 ± 2.3) ×
105 M–1, as deduced using the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation (Figure S11), and the limit of
detection (LOD) for Cu2+ by L was evaluated
to be 2.5 nM (0.925 ppb) (Figure S12).
The 1:1 complex formed was further confirmed by observing a peak at m/z = 1564.75 corresponding to the {L + Cu2+-H+} in ESI-MS (Figure 2c). The assignment of this
peak to the copper complex was further confirmed by comparing the
experimentally observed isotopic peak pattern to that of the calculated
one.

point. (b) Plot of absorbance ratio of 420 nm band over 290 nm band
as a function of mole ratio of [Cu2+]/[L].
(c) ESI-MS image of the Cu2+ complex of L.
The inset shows the isotopic peak pattern for the molecular ion peak
obtained from experiment (black) and that from the simulated (red).

The changes observed in the fluorescence
spectra of L during the titration of Cu2+ were
ratiometric (Figure 3b), wherein the intensity
of the 570 nm band decreases and that of the 475 nm band increases,
resulting in an isoemissive point at 507 nm (Figure 3a). The plot of the intensity ratio of these
two bands w.r.t. the [Cu2+]/[L] mole ratio
is sigmoidal. Thus, both the absorption and fluorescence titrations
exhibited evidence for the formation of the complex between L and Cu2+. The limit of detection (LOD) was derived
based on the emission intensity, and this has been 1.9 nM (0.7 ppb)
(Figure S13). The thermodynamics of the
binding between L and Cu2+ has been studied
by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) titration (Figure 3c). The binding was observed
as exothermic with a change in the enthalpy being −4.17 ×
104 cal/mol. The titration data fit well with one site
binding with a Ka value of 1.61 ×
104 M–1 in the case of Cu2+. The negative ΔS value (−131.6 cal/mol/deg)
observed is suggestive of the complex formation between L and Cu2+ (Figure 3c). In effect, the ITC data support 1:1 complexation between L and Cu2+, as already shown based on ESI-MS.

1H NMR titrations
were carried out to study the binding
of L by Cu2+, and the corresponding spectra
are shown in Figures 4 and S15. A comparison of the spectrum
of L to those observed in the presence of Cu2+ clearly reveals both broadening and shifting substantially in different
peaks. In the presence of TFA, the spiro-indoline moiety of L opens up, leading to the formation of a mixture of both
the closed and open forms, as noted in Figures 4ii and S14a,b,
whereas in the presence of Cu2+, the ring not only opens
but also stabilizes by binding, as can be noted from Figures 4iii–vi and S14c. The alkenyl peaks appearing at 5.7 and
6.9 ppm in the closed form shift
to downfield, and the corresponding peaks appeared at 7.55 and 8.6
ppm upon ring opening followed by Cu2+ binding (Figure 4ii–vi) in
its trans-form (inside the boxes).17 With
incremental addition of Cu2+, the peak for the closed form
disappears, while the peaks for the open form gain in intensity and
further broaden. Thus, the aromatic peaks from the indoline moiety
appearing at 6.45, 6.80, 7.05, and 7.15 ppm shift downfield to the
7.5–8.0 ppm region. At higher mole ratios of Cu2+ addition, two of the singlets observed in the aromatic region of
7.0–7.2 ppm increase in the peak area besides being marginally
shifted by 0.05 ppm (Figure 4ii–vi).

structure. The inset shows expanded region of the spectrum for L (blue) and {L + 0.2 equiv Cu2+}

Characterization of the
Isolated Cu2+ Complex of L
The broad
nature of the peaks in the 1H NMR spectrum and the comparison
of the spectrum to that of L (Figure 4) confirm that the L is complexed
by Cu2+ (Figure S16). The spectrum
obtained for
the isolated Cu2+ complex of L (Figure S16 and Figure 4vi) agrees well with that obtained when Cu2+ was added in situ to L. The presence of vibrational
bands corresponding to L, such as those from the carbonyl
group, triazole moiety, and the hydroxy group in the Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of the complex in comparison to the spectrum
of L alone, supports the formation of the complex (Figure 5a). The diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS) data obtained for the solids of L and
its Cu2+ complex are similar to those observed for their
solutions, supporting that the complex is retained even in the solution
(Figure 5b). For the
isolated complex, one would expect the fluorescence of L to be quenched due to the presence of paramagnetic Cu2+ ion, and the same has been observed (Figure 5c) as well. The presence of paramagnetic
copper center in the complex was confirmed by electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectrum, which shows the presence of characteristic
peaks for Cu(II). The EPR spectrum showed 2.44 and 2.12 for the g∥ and g⊥ values, respectively, wherein g∥ > g⊥ (Figure 5d). In the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) image, the L alone (Figure 5e) shows particles of irregular shape, while
the isolated complex exhibits nanorods with size ranging from 150
to 250 nm (Figure 5f). Although the L alone shows discrete particles, an
extensive aggregation of these particles was observed in the presence
of Cu2+. From the high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) images and
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern, the crystalline
nature of the complex has been established with an interplanar distance
of 0.27 nm (Figure 5g,h).

Induced Self-Assembly in L by
Cu2+ by
Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
In the literature, the
calix[4]arene derivatives are known to exhibit self-assembly, and
such aggregational features are generally altered when an ion or a
molecule interacts with and/or binds to them.23,24 SEM studies of L showed particles with sizes in the
range of 19–32 nm (Figure 6a), which are mostly spherical in nature. In the presence
of Cu2+, such particles are joined together to form rods
with length ranging from 150 to 300 nm, supporting that the aggregation
of the particles is induced by Cu2+ (Figures 6b and S17). A
similar rod-shaped morphology of ∼300 nm was also observed
in the case of the isolated complex of Cu2+ with L (Figure 6c).

Complexation of L with Cu2+ by Density
Functional Theory (DFT) Computations
The structure of L was optimized according to the details given in Experimental Section, and the corresponding optimized
structure is shown in Figure 7a. The optimized structure for L possesses two
O–H···O-type intramolecular hydrogen bonds at
lower rim and stabilizes the cone conformation for the calix[4]arene
platform. The time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) studies
are able to predict the two absorption bands (429 and 507 nm), which
were observed in the visible region (420 and 540 nm) of the spectrum
for L correctly (Figure S18).

The spiro-indoline functionality
present at the lower rim of L is well suited for metal-ion
binding. As the spectral titration
data reported in this paper clearly showed the formation of 1:1 complex
between L and Cu2+, the structural features
of such complex were addressed by DFT computations. Several conjecture
structures for the complex were generated by carefully placing the
metal ion at all of the possible binding regions available at L (Figure S08). The optimized structure
for the complex is show in Figure 7b along with its geometrical features. The two O–H···O
types of hydrogen bonds observed in L at the lower rim
continue to be present even in the complex, suggesting that the conformation
of the calix[4]arene platform does not change upon complexation (Table S1). The structure of the complex exhibits
tetracoordinated Cu2+ center. Each arm of the lower rim
of L contributes one phenolic-O and one triazole-N for
coordination. Such coordination features were also noted for Mg2+ complex of triazole-linked nitro-functionalized spiro-pyran-derivatized
calix[4]arene in the literature.25 The
complexation energy for the formation of the complex of Cu2+ of L is −518 kcal/mol. In the case of this complex,
the Cu2+−O1/−O2 bond
distances are 1.897 and 1.887 Å and the Cu2+−N1/−N2 bond distances are 2.124 and 2.087
Å, respectively. The bond angles in the primary coordination
sphere range from 99 to 142° supporting that the geometry about
Cu2+ is highly distorted tetrahedral. The coordinates of
the optimized structures of L and its Cu2+ complex are given in Table S3. On going
from L to its complex, substantial arm conformational
changes occur to orient the ligating centers in a manner to accommodate
Cu2+ coordinatively in the core. The dihedral angle of
5-6-7-8 shifts from 152 to 83° in one arm and 98–306°
in the other arm. The dihedral angle of 6-7-8-9 (Figure 7c) shifts from 200 to 84°
in one arm, while the other shows only minimal shift (Figure S19). Thus, the Cu2+-induced
conformational changes are evident from these dihedral angles in both
the arms to form a binding core.

To understand the binding strength,
the corresponding molecular
orbitals and their energies (Figure 7) were computed using DFT since the HOMO and LUMO gap
(ΔEgap) accounts for the stability
of the complex. In L, ΔEgap is 3.90 eV and the HOMO is exclusively localized on the spiro-indoline
group, and a similar observation is seen in the case of LUMO (Figure 7d). However, upon
the complexation of L with Cu2+ ion, ΔEgap is reduced to 1.63 eV, indicating that the
complexation stabilizes L. The HOMO is localized on the
atoms present in the proximity to Cu2+ ion, while the LUMO
is localized on the spiro-indoline groups of L. Based
on the TDDFT computational studies, the complex exhibits vertical
excitation energy at 435 nm. This is in agreement with the experimentally
observed absorption spectrum showing a band at 420 nm. The optimized
structure of the L clearly shows an all-trans geometry
for the open form (encircled in Figure 7a), which is referred as merocyanine in the literature.17

Complex of L with Cu2+ by X-ray Photoelectron
Spectroscopy (XPS) Data
The complex formed between L and Cu2+ was also supported by XPS studies (Figures 8 and S20), and the results obtained for the isolated
complex are similar to those of in situ generated 1:1 complex. The
computational study supported the formation of an N2O2 primary coordination core with respect to Cu2+. This is expected to shift the XPS peaks of copper, nitrogen, and
oxygen, and the same is observed supporting that the Cu2+ complex of L is formed. The 1s XPS spectra of C, N,
and O showed shifts in the peaks of the complex compared to the L alone (Figure 8a–c). The C 1s spectrum of L showed a shift in
the peak observed at 282.4–283.8 eV upon complexation with
Cu2+ (Figure 8a). The N 1s spectra exhibited a shift in the peak by 1.08 eV on
going from L to its Cu2+ complex that is observed
at 399.18 eV (Figure 8b). In O 1s spectra, the peak observed at 530.4 eV for L was shifted to 531.25 eV in its complex (Figure 8c). The presence of copper was validated
through Cu 2p XPS image of the complex, whereas such peak was absent
in the uncomplexed L (Figure 8d). All of this reveals the binding of L by Cu2+ and thus supports the conclusions obtained
from other experimental and computational studies.

1s, (b) N 1s, (c) O 1s, and (d) Cu 2p for L (black) and

Cell Viability Study by Methyl Thiazolyl Tetrazolium (MTT) Assay
The spiro-indoline-based molecular systems are known to exhibit
anticancer properties,18 but similar moieties
anchored on to the calix[4]arene platform have not been reported for
such activity. In the present study, L and its Cu2+ complex have been demonstrated for imaging cancer cells
and also for their cancer cell-killing abilities using MDA-MB-231
cells. The MTT assay was carried out with these cells by both L and its Cu2+ complex at different concentrations.
The cell viability data given in Figure 9a showed that L alone does not
exhibit much cell death (cell viability being ∼95%) even at
higher concentrations. However, the complex exhibited effective cancer
cell-killing ability with an IC50 value of 165 nM as derived
from the plot of concentration vs percent live cells shown in Figure 9b. The complex exhibited
higher cell death potency compared to simple Cu2+ salt
at an equivalent concentration (Figure S21), and the comparative data clearly show that the presence of L augments the cell death supporting that the complex is essential.

24 h at varying concentrations of L (black bar) and its
Cu2+ complex (red bar). (b) Plot of % live cells vs concentration
of the complex for the determination of the IC50 value.

Mechanism of Cell Death
by Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting
(FACS) Analysis
To study the mechanism of cell death, cell
cycle analysis was performed by FACS with 230 nM L and
its complex treated with MDA-MB-231 cells, while the untreated cells
were used as control. From Figure 10a, it is observed that the population of G0/G1 phase was high in the control studies (only cells
and L-treated cells). Upon addition of the complex from
0 to 255 nM concentrations to these cells, a shift of population from
G0/G1 and G2M phases toward Sub-G1 phase was observed (Figures 10b and S22). All of these
studies suggest cell death as demonstrated using MDA-MB231 cells by
the FACS studies. These data support MTT assay results by suggesting
that the treatment with higher concentration of the complex increases
the cell death potency.

cells untreated

with increasing concentrations of the complex for 6 h (0–255
nM). In both the cases: (i) SubG1, (ii) G0/G1, (iii) S, and (iv) G2M.

Cell Imaging Studies
The spiro-indoline derivatives
are reported for their red fluorescence due to the extended conjugation.15 Cancer cell imaging studies carried out with L and its complex showed red fluorescence in MDA-MB-231 cells
(Figure 11). Colocalization
studies carried out with MitoTracker Green show merging of red and
green to form yellow color, which showed the accumulation of L as well as the complex in the mitochondrial region of the
cells. So, L can be utilized as cancer cell imaging agent,
whereas its Cu2+ complex can be used for cancer cell theranostics.
Colocalization studies carried out in comparison to MitoTracker Green
showed an overlap integral of 0.9 (Figure S23 and Table S2), which confirms that the L goes
to the mitochondria. Other than this, the quenching of the red fluorescence
intensity for the complex confirms the quenching of fluorescence of L by Cu2+ ions.

untreated (control) and
treated with L and the Cu2+ complex according
to the labels given.

Cell Internalization Study
The MDA-MB-231 cells treated
with different concentrations of the complex were analyzed for the
cell-incorporated copper by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry
(ICP-MS), and the corresponding data are given in Figure 12. These data supported the
presence of increasing amount of copper in the cells with increase
in the concentration of the complex used for treating the cells. The
copper present inside the cell is substantially higher than the intrinsic
copper of the cells, and hence all of this supports the internalization.
The presence of L inside the cells is viewed through
its fluorescence emission as studied by fluorescence imaging. Thus,
the internalization of the complex by these cells was established
by a combination of ICP-MS and fluorescence microscopy.

Conclusions and Comparisons
A triazole-linked lower-rim bis-spiro-indoline-functionalized calix[4]arene
conjugate (L) has been synthesized and characterized.
The L can exist either in the ring-closed (spiropyan)
or in the open (merocyanine) form due to the presence of spiro-indoline
ring at its lower rim. It has been experimentally verified by us as
well as others in the literature15−17 that the transformation
from closed to open form can be achieved by (i) UV irradiation and
(ii) adding acids such as trifluroacetic acid (Figures 1 and S24). This
transformation is noted by observing an increase in the absorbance
at 420 nm band and emission intensity at 570 nm in the fluorescence
spectra. The titration of L with Cu2+ showed
ratiometric changes in the absorption as well as fluorescence spectra
by exhibiting isosbestic and isoemmisive points at 333 and 507 nm,
respectively, supporting the formation of the complex of L. The binding constant of L by Cu2+ is (6.9
± 2.3) × 105 M–1 as obtained
from the absorption spectral data, and this supports rather strong
binding interaction between the ligand and Cu2+. While
the Job plot yielded 1:1 complex, the ITC data confirmed the same.
The 1:1 complex has been further established by observing a peak in
ESI MS at m/z = 1564.757, and the
isotopic peak pattern supported the presence of the copper ion in
that. The binding of Cu2+ to L was further
supported by carrying out 1H NMR titration, wherein the
binding of this ion by the open form of the spiro-indoline moiety
as well as the paramagnetic broadening were evident from the spectral
changes.

The copper complex of L was isolated,
and the 1H NMR spectrum of this complex has been noted
to have features
similar to that obtained when the L was titrated in situ
with Cu2+ salt (Figures 4iii–vi and Figure S16). The presence of 4.1 and 3.2 ppm peaks in 1H NMR spectrum
supported that the cone conformation is maintained for the calix[4]arene
platform even in the complex. The paramagnetic nature of the complex
was also deduced from the EPR spectrum. The fluorescence spectrum
obtained for the solid of the isolated complex also showed quenching
of the fluorescence compared to simple L as expected.
The quenching of fluorescence intensity of L was observed
even during the in situ titration by Cu2+ salt. Even DRS
spectra supported the presence of L in the complex. Irregular
shaped particles of ∼25 nm size observed for L were joined together to form rodlike particles in the presence of
Cu2+. The length of these rods ranges from 300 to 400 nm,
suggesting that the formation of these rods is due to the induced
aggregation of L and Cu2+. Similar rods were
observed even when the microscopy study was performed using the isolated
complex. All of this supports that the microscopic features observed
for the isolated complex exists even in the solution. From the TEM
studies it was observed that L alone exhibits nonuniform
particles and these are further aggregated to rodlike shape in the
presence of Cu2+. Thus, both SEM and TEM support Cu2+-induced aggregation in L.

The HOMO–LUMO
gap decreases from 3.9 eV in L to 1.63 eV in its Cu2+ complex, which supports the stabilization
of L upon binding of Cu2+ as already demonstrated
by the experimental studies. The DFT computational studies showed
N2O2 binding core of L for Cu2+ with distorted tetrahedral coordination geometry about the
metal ion. These studies also showed that the binding of Cu2+ induces conformational changes in the lower rim of L, as evident from the dihedral angles. The complexation of Cu2+ did not alter the cone conformation of the calix[4]arene
platform, as evident from the observed hydrogen-bonding interaction
at lower rim, similar to that observed for L alone. The
binding of L by Cu2+ is supported by the changes
observed in the binding energies of N 1s and O 1s by 1.08 and 0.85
eV, respectively, from the XPS spectra.

The L alone
does not kill cancer cells (MDA-MB-231
cells) (Scheme 2),
but it shows red fluorescence when incubated with MDA-MB-231 cells
due to the targeting ability of L toward mitochondria,
which is strongly supported by the observed overlap coefficient of
0.9 from the colocalization study. The presence of Cu2+ in the incubated cells has been verified quantitatively by ICP-MS
studies. The copper complex of L exhibited an IC50 value of 165 nM, suggesting that the complex is an efficient
anticancer agent. The cell cycle analysis showed the arrest of SubG1
population for the cells incubated with the complex. The major outcome
of this study has been figuratively summarized in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Figurative Representation
of Different Facets of L and
Its Complex as Reported in This Paper
Although there are a number of spiro-indoline derivatives
being
reported in the literature for sensing Zn2+ and Cu2+ by both fluorescence enhancement and quenching, none of
these is based on the calixarene platform.26−35 All of these non-calixarene-based ones showed micro- to submicromolar
level of detection, and few of these were used for cell imaging. However,
to our knowledge, there are only two spiro-indoline-linked 1,3-derivatized
calix[4]arenes known in the literature, one of which is involved in
sensing Mg2+ and the other is involved in selective sensing
of Eu3+.25,36,37 The sensing features of all such molecular systems are listed in Table S4 in the Supporting Information. The importance
of the current probe is due to (i) the derivatization being on the
calix[4]arene platform, which is scarce in the literature, (ii) its
nanomolar sensing for Cu2+, (iii) its mitochondrial targeting
ability, and (iv) its nanomolar IC50 value (165 nM) for
MDA-MB231 cancer cells. All of this leads to the fact that the Cu2+ complex of L is a potential anticancer agent.

Therefore, a spiro-indoline-based calix[4]arene derivative can
be transformed from the closed- to open-ring form in a stimuli-responsive
manner (irradiation, metal ion, and acid); the open form is further
stabilized by complexation with Cu2+, and the corresponding
complex is an efficient anticancer theranostic agent.

Synthesis and Characterization of L
The
precursor P4 was dissolved in
5–10 mL of ethanol, and the solution was heated to reflux.
After 30 min, piperidine (0.1 mL) was added to this. A solution of P3 (0.2 g) in ethanol (20 mL) was
added to the reaction mixture and refluxed for 24 h. Completion of
the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography. After completion
of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated to dryness and the crude
product was purified by silica gel chromatography using petroleum
ether/ethyl acetate (2:3) as elution medium to get a light pink solid L (Figure S05). Yield: 0.1 g (64%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ = 6.97–7.16

Found., 78.21; H, 7.82; N, 7.48.

Synthesis of [CuL] Complex
A mixture of L (0.05 g) and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O (0.012 g) was taken in a flask, and
10 mL of acetonitrile was added
and the resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature. An excess
amount of Et3N was added and stirring was continued for
1 day. A brownish yellow precipitate was found, which was filtered,
washed with acetonitrile, and dried. Yield: 0.025 g. FTIR (KBr, cm–1): 3622, 2988, 2245, 1624, 1393 and 1028. XPS (Cu
2p, eV): 931 and 950.

Spectral Titration Studies
Stock
solutions of L (0.6 mM) were incubated with 0.02 M trifluoroacetic
acid
(TFA) for 1 day and used for the studies. The 0.6 mM copper perchlorate
solution was prepared in acetonitrile. The L was titrated
with 0–5 equiv of Cu2+, and accordingly, the absorption
and fluorescence spectra were measured. Fluorescence spectra were
measured at λex = 379 nm in the range of 400–700
nm in a 10 mm cuvette containing 3 mL of analyte solution. 1H NMR titrations of L and TFA (0.02 equiv for 0–60
min) and Cu2+ (0–2 equiv) were carried out in CD3CN.

Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) Experiments
Calorimetric titration was carried out at 25 °C using a MicroCal
ITC20 isothermal titration calorimeter (Northampton, MA). The 15 mM
Cu2+ solution (40 μL) was taken in a syringe and
titrated into 1 mM (270 μL) solution of ligand L in the cell through 20 injections. The one site binding model was
used to fit the obtained data after appropriate subtraction of the
solvent interaction with metal ion as control study.

SEM, TEM,
and XPS Analyses
For SEM studies, 50 μM
solution of L and the solution containing 1:1 mole ratio
of L:Cu2+ and [CuL] in acetonitrile
were drop-cast onto Al foil after ultrasonication for 15 min. For
TEM and XPS analyses, the solutions of L and [CuL] were drop-cast onto carbon-coated copper grid and Al foil,
respectively. The samples were dried in a vacuum desiccator before
performing the measurements.

DRS Study
The diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy (DRS)
data of the isolated complex and L were measured in barium
sulfate matrix using Shimadzu-UV-3600.

IR and EPR Measurements
IR spectra of L and its Cu2+ complex were
measured using KBr pellet in
the 400–4000 cm–1 region. The X-band EPR
spectrum of [CuL] was recorded on a JES-FA200 ESR spectrometer
in solid state at room temperature.

DFT Studies
All
of the calculations were carried out
by using Gaussian 16, Revision B.01 software packages.41 The open structural form of L was
generated, optimized, and subjected to TDDFT to generate the possible
electronic transitions. The initial structure has been prepared from
the reported crystal structure42 followed
by certain modifications as given in Figures S06–S08. The optimized structure for the open form of L has
been used for the complexation by Cu2+ ions by DFT and
TDDFT in the gas phase as well as in acetonitrile solvent. The DFT
computations adopted here are in unrestricted formalism since the
metal ion is paramagnetic. During the geometry optimization, the B3LYP
functional with SDD was used for Cu2+ ion and the 6-31G(d,p)
basis set was used for the rest of the atoms. The vertical excitation
energies were studied in acetonitrile solvent using the polarized
continuum method using the self-consistent reaction field tool available
in the Gaussian16 software package.

Cell Viability Assay
The anticancer property of the
samples of L and its Cu2+ complex was tested
on MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells using 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The cells were seeded in 96-well
plate with ∼15 000 cells per well in a Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penstrep (antibiotic and antimycotic). After incubation
for 24 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere, the cells
were incubated for 24 h with various concentrations of L and its complex (0, 66, 132, 198, 330, 528, and 660 nM). After 24
h treatment, each well was treated with 0.5 mg/mL methyl thiazolyl
tetrazolium (MTT) reagent and incubated for 4 h. The medium was removed
and 200 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added into each
well to dissolve the crystals formed. The absorbance at λmax = 570 nm was measured using a plate reader.

Confocal Microscopy
MDA-MB-231 cells were seeded in
60 mm culture dishes containing glass coverslip with a seeding density
of 0.5 × 106 cells in DMEM and incubated for 24 h
at 37 °C. The cells were treated with 333 nM concentration of
each L and the complex separately and were incubated
for another 24 h. After removing the medium, the cells were washed
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times to remove excess
of the compound and stained with 100 nM MitoTracker Green (M7514)
in a fresh complete medium and incubated for 0.5 h. After that, the
cells were washed again with PBS three times and the coverslips were
placed on a glass slide with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
and observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope. The untreated
cells were used as control.

Cell Cycle and Fluorescence-Activated Cell
Sorting (FACS) Analyses
MDA-MB-231 cells (0.5 × 106 cells) were incubated
for 24 h in 60 mm dishes, treated with varying concentrations of L and its Cu2+ complex, and incubated again. After
removing the medium and fixing the cells with ethanol, the cells were
stained with 10 μL of propidium iodide (from a stock solution
of 1 mg/mL) in 1 mL of complete medium cells observed using red filter
in FACS.

Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry Analysis (ICP-MS)
MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured in 60 mm dishes with complete DMEM
for 24 h. The cells were treated with varying concentrations of L and its Cu2+ complex separately for 24 h at 37
°C followed by harvesting through centrifugation at 1000 rpm
for 3 min and vortexed to rupture the cell membrane. These samples
were further used for ICP-MS analysis. The untreated cells were used
as control.
