The local structure of a series of
homologous protic ionic liquids (PILs) is investigated using ab initio
computations and ab initio-based molecular dynamics. The purpose of
this work is to show that in PILs the network of hydrogen bonds may
promote like-charge clustering between anionic species. We correlate
the theoretical evidence of this possibility with viscosity experimental
data. The homologous series of liquids is obtained by coupling choline
with amino acid anions and varying the side chain. We find that the
frictional properties of the liquids are clearly connected to the
ability of the side chain to establish additional hydrogen bonds (other
than the trivial cation–anion interaction). We also show that
the large variation of bulk properties along the series of compounds
can be explained by assuming that one of the sources of friction in
the bulk liquid is the like-charge interaction between anions.

1 Introduction
Protic
ionic liquids (PILs)1−4 are among the most interesting members of the rather vast class
of materials known as ionic liquids (ILs). PILs can be formally thought
(and often practically synthesized) as the result of an acid–base
reaction. If the complexity of the molecular constituents is sufficient,
lattice formation is frustrated by entropic effects and occurs only
at low temperatures, so that the resulting material is liquid under
room conditions. In practice, lattice formation at room temperature
can be prevented rather easily using molecular ions with delocalized
charge distributions (weakening of electrostatic interactions) or
with a sufficient difference in their volumetric dimensions and shapes
(disorder induced by steric mismatch).

It is well known that
only a large difference in the pKa’s
of the reagents (>6) in the acid–base reaction guarantees
the ensuing liquid to be completely ionized.5 If the difference in pKa is small (<4),6 the liquid may turn out to be a mixture of ions
and polar molecules, where phase separation and evaporation of the
volatile component may occur to various degrees.

Despite their
synthetic simplicity, PILs show unexpectedly complex structural patterns
and even some intriguing chemical activity, which are due to a series
of interrelated phenomena, such as nanosegregation7,8 and
hydrogen bonding features,9,10 and due to the possibility
of having tautomerization reactions involving secondary protic functions
on the molecular structure.11,12

Due to the possibility
of changing the substituent on either the cation (base) or the anion
(acid), the number of possible PILs is practically infinite, and it
should be possible to tune their physical and chemical properties
by engineering the desired cation–anion structures. Particularly
attractive is the possibility of creating a homologous series of materials
to rationalize the relation between the molecular structure and the
ensuing bulk properties.13 In this work,
we will use such a series of compounds where the same choline cation
[Ch] is coupled to a (singly) deprotonated amino acid anion [AA],
whose variety is obtained by changing the side chain (for a complete
list of the liquids under investigation see Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

Incidentally, it turns
out that these compounds (which have been actually synthesized)14 are fully biocompatible15−17 and might be
appealing for applications in pharmacological and biomedical research.18−23 In addition, these PILs, often possessing relatively mobile protons
on the side chain, have been a target of intensive research in electrochemical
applications.24−27

The aim of this work is to elucidate the short-range structure
of the bulk fluids by using both newly computed ab initio data and
the results of previously performed ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMDs)
simulations. One of the most intriguing features that we have been
noticing by analyzing the results of MD simulations is that the bulk
phase of these materials shows evidence for aggregation phenomena
due to the formation of clusters made by like-charge ions (specifically
anions). This evidence transforms the common concept that ILs can
be thought as constituted by a disordered array of alternating charges.
The existence of like-charge molecular interactions in ILs has already
been noticed in other ILs,28−32 where the presence of H-bond-driven, cationic complexes has been
detected.33

In the series of compounds
that we shall present here, the clustering seems to take place between
anions where, as we shall see, the cooperative effect of hydrogen
bonds is sufficient to overcome the Coulomb repulsion. Here, we try
to unravel the basic physics behind this surprising organization pattern
that we have already proven to exist for some of the cholinium amino
acid-based PILs (e.g., ref (11)).

2 Relative Stability of Anion–Cation
Couples
The series of compounds made by choline and a deprotonated
amino acid anion show a clear homogeneity at the microscopic level.
One of the most striking results is that by computing the properties
of the isolated, gas-phase anion–cation ionic couples, all
of the resulting structures look very similar. We have already elucidated
this result in ref (35), where we have analyzed the behavior and the stability trend of
the ionic couples obtained with eight different amino acid anions.
We found that the binding energies were almost constant along the
series and between 102 and 106 kcal/mol. An exception was represented
by [His] that had a lower binding energy of 93 kcal/mol. The binding
pattern of the ionic couples was found to be very similar along the
series of amino acids and due to a strong hydrogen bonding between
the hydroxyl of the cation and the carboxylate of the anion. This
homogeneity of behavior in the cation–anion interaction was
further confirmed by bulk simulations where the average (atomic pair)
radial distance between the two oxygens partaking in the H-bond was
substantially constant throughout the series, and its value turned
out to range between 2.68 and 2.74 Å.

Despite the homogeneity
at the microscopic level, the bulk properties of the ensuing liquids
are very different (see refs (14) and (34)). Viscosities range from 1.6 Pa s for [Ala] to more than 20 Pa s
for [Glu] and [Asp]. Conductivities vary by 2 orders of magnitude
along the series, and some compounds were liquid only above 90 °C.

It is therefore clear that cooperative, many-body effects are extremely
important in these compounds and that the understanding of their properties
cannot rely on the description of the isolated ionic couples. In this
study, we extend our previous works to other amino acids, and we try
to find an explanation for the variety of behaviors spotted by the
experimental bulk measurements. We begin by presenting the association
enthalpies for the ionic couples (cation–anion) examined in
this work. The data are reported in Table 1. In this table we present the results obtained
with three different functionals: plain B3LYP, dispersion-corrected
B3LYP (D3-B3LYP), and a quite accurate functional based on MP2 correlation
(D3-B2PLYP). For each functional, the computation of the optimal geometry
has been repeated in a polarizable continuum solvent model (PCM, see Section 6 for further details).

Binding enthalpies are very large
in the gas phase where they substantially reproduce our old data of
ref (35). The data
obtained with D3-B3LYP and D3-B2PLYP are very similar with only a
few tenths of kcal variation. It is worth noting that without dispersion
correction these enthalpies turn out to be about 5–10 kcal
less negative.

Obviously, these numbers are greatly reduced
in a model continuum solvent because of the screening due to the presence
of the dielectric and due to the solvation energies of the dissociated
fragments. As we can see, the [His] and [Asp] and [Glu] ionic couples
are the least bound among all.

All of the above ionic couples
are characterized by essentially the same structure. Apart from the
obvious electrostatic interaction, the general binding motif sees
a strong H-bonding feature between the cation OH and the carboxylate
O–. The O–O distances are very similar along
the series, ranging from 2.64 to 2.70 Å. We clearly see that
the main binding features in the ionic couples are extremely homogeneous
along the series and that the substantially different behavior of
the resulting bulk phase must derive from collective effects.

3 Relative stability of Anion–Anion Aggregates
One of the possible explanations for the different bulk behavior
relies on the, rather obvious, assumption that it must derive from
the anion structure that represents the “tunable” moiety
in the fluid. As we have already pointed out in ref (11), we have discovered that
the local microscopic structure of these liquids can be very complex.
This complexity is due to a series of inter-related features:

the amino acid anions can bind to
each other through H-bonding features whose stability is much less
than the cation–anion H-bond mentioned above but, nevertheless,
can still be a relevant source of cohesive energy in the bulk;

the anionic amino acid partner can undergo
a tautomerization reaction and become an anionic zwitterion,37 whose charge distribution is rather different
from the plain anionic form; this tautomerization takes place for
those amino acid anions that possess an additional, second protic
function on the side chain (for example, another carboxyl or an −SH
group), whose proton can be internally transferred to the amino group;

amino acid anions, when interacting through
H-bonds, can undergo intermolecular proton transfer, altering the
local charge distribution of the bulk.

To
quantify the importance of these phenomena, we have decided to evaluate
the relative stability of the dimeric anionic clusters using ab initio
techniques. This is by no means an obvious task, as the anionic pairs
naturally tend to dissociate in vacuum. We have, therefore, performed
the computations using a dielectric continuum solvent medium to screen
the Coulomb repulsion and provide a more realistic modeling of the
real bulk environment. Dielectric constants in PILs range from 20
to 80 depending on the number of electron-rich atoms in the molecular
structures. We have exploited this fact and we have chosen a model
solvent (acetonitrile) that has a dielectric constant of 35.7 that
represents a value in line with available measurements, but that was
not so high as to provide a testing ground only for highly oxygenated
compounds.

The results obtained in a similar fashion to the
ones presented for the cation–anion couples are in Table 2. Most of the amino
acids do not show the presence of a minimum for the two interacting
anions in the gas phase. It might sound surprising, but, despite the
inherent instability of the gas-phase, like-charge dimers, we see
that a few amino acids (specifically [Thr], [His], [Asp], [Glu], and
[Cys]) were able to form metastable complexes, whose structures are
actual high-energy minima on the potential energy surface, even without
a dielectric (Table 2, first column). In particular, the [His] and [Glu] amino acid anions
seem to be rather striking examples of the stability of such unlikely
structures, providing a hint that anionic, like-charge clustering
in these systems can be more common than one might surmise.

b Obtained with 6-31+G**. The last column
on the right contains the ratio between the anion–anion B2PLYP/PCM
binding energy and the anion–cation one of Table 1.

Almost all of the examined amino acid anion dimers
(at the D3-B3LYP and D3-B2PLYP levels) are stable (of a few kcal)
with respect to dissociation when immersed in a sufficiently screening
dielectric. Only for [Pro] have we been unable to find a structure
with a negative association energy. For all compounds, dispersion
forces do play a crucial role in allowing the stabilization of such
elusive complexes.

As we can see from Table 2, a particularly large stabilization energy
is obtained for [His], [Thr], and [Glu], where the anion–anion
binding energy turns out to be a substantial amount of the anion–cation
one (last column in Table 2). For all other amino acid anions, the anion–anion
binding energy is significantly smaller than the cation–anion
one, even though for some systems the former could account for one-fourth
of the total cohesive energy.

As anion–anion dimers seem
to be likely to occur, we can assume that it is precisely this additional
cohesive mechanism that differentiates the bulk behavior along the
series. To strengthen this conclusion, we show in Figure 1 (left panel) a plot in which
we have reported the anion–anion binding energies as determined
by us (x-axis) and the experimental viscosities (y-axis). There is a correlation between the binding energy
of the dianions and the bulk friction for most of the amino acids
(beware that the relation between viscosity and energy is logarithmic),
whereas the [Asp], [Glu], and [Ala] cases seem to provide an interesting
exception. In Figure 1, we have also reported the same viscosity data as a function of
the “ratio” column of Table 2, i.e., the ratio between the anion–anion
binding energy and the cation–anion one. In this case, we see
a better correlation between the relative importance of the anion–anion
cohesive energy and a greater friction in the fluid. Although the
fact that the ability of a component of the fluid to establish H-bonds
provides additional friction might sound as an obvious statement,
much less obvious is the fact that the additional cohesive energy
might come from like-charge clustering.

binding energies vs measured viscosity values for selected PILs. (Right)
Ratio of the anion–anion and anion–cation binding energies
vs measured viscosities. An exponential regression (dashed line) is
also shown.

The stabilization of
these anion–anion structures is due mainly to H-bonding features,
depending on the side chain nature and functional groups. As a first
example, we report in Figure 2a the optimized structures of the [Ile] dimer, which is representative
of the amino acids with an aliphatic side chain. Aliphatic amino acid
anions bind each other via two weak H-bonds, whose acceptor–donor
distances are larger than 3 Å. These H-bonding features come
in pairs, except for [Nle] for which we have found a low-energy structure
with only one H-bond. The connections are established between the
carboxylate and the amino group. As is obvious, such a double H-bond
arrangement can exist in the liquid only if the carboxylate function
is not already bound to the choline hydroxyl. Therefore, we deem that
such H-bonds are only seldom formed in the bulk liquid, although it
is certainly possible that an arrangement with a single H-bond may
exist as a transient feature owing to the bidentate nature of the
carboxylate group.

Figure 2 Optimized structures at the D3-B3LYP/PCM level for [Ile]
(a) and [His] (b) anionic dimers. Acceptor–donor distances
in H-bonds are also shown.

The [His] compound (shown in Figure 2b) is a more interesting case, where one
of the H-bonds between anions is established between the aliphatic
amino group and the imidazole ring, therefore without requiring the
intervention of a carboxylate. Such an H-bond in our optimized structure
has an acceptor–donor distance of 2.83 Å, which points
to a stronger binding with respect to what we have seen for the aliphatic
amino acids. As we see in Table 2, the binding energy between two anions in their most
favorable geometry amounts to 75% of the anion–cation binding
energy. This makes the [His][Ch] IL certainly an interesting case,
where anionic clustering can be an additional source of cohesive energy
that can represent the reason for its high viscosity.

The [Thr]
anion (Figure 3a) has
a hydroxyl group at the end of the side chain that binds strongly
to one of the carboxylate oxygens. Its binding energy is, however,
rather small and comparable to other aliphatic or aromatic side chains
(e.g., [Phe]). Nevertheless, the peculiar presence of the hydroxyl,
as we shall see later, provides a bulk nanostructure which is quite
unique in the series.

Figure 3 Optimized structures at the D3-B3LYP/PCM level for [Thr]
(a) and [Asp] (b) anionic dimers. Acceptor–donor distances
in H-bonds are also shown.

The [Asp] and [Glu] cases are similar to each other (see Figure 3b). These anions
bind through a “salt-bridge” double bond, which is known
to be particularly stable, hence the rather high binding energy that
is a significant fraction of the anion–cation one. At difference
with previous cases, the anion–anion binding pattern involves
only non-negatively charged functional groups. The two negative carboxylates
point outside the dimer to minimize their Coulomb repulsive interaction.
These geometrical features, as we shall see below, indicate that the
structure of the corresponding liquids cannot be that of an alternating
pattern of anions and cations but is certainly more complex with a
high degree of anionic association.

4 Connection
with Bulk Short-Range Structure
All of the above ILs have
been simulated in their bulk state by us using AIMD in the past few
years (e.g., see ref (12) and the Supporting Information, Table S1 for further details on the simulation protocols). Different paradigms
and different functionals have been used, and therefore, we should
compare the results with caution. Nevertheless, many of the simulations
have been carefully validated using experimental structural and spectroscopic
data, and we believe that the quality of the computations is sufficient
to interpret the bulk nanoscopic structure (e.g., see refs10−12). Finally, we remark that all data extracted from
the bulk simulations come from calculations where the forces have
been evaluated through ab initio density functional theory (DFT) computations
of the electronic structure. Despite few well-known shortcomings of
the DFT method, it is generally accepted that molecular dynamics simulations
based on such ab initio paradigm are quite accurate in reproducing
the short-range structure of the fluid and generally, in this respect,
show a superior accuracy compared to force field-based approaches.

We begin by reporting the radial distribution function (RDF in
the following) of the O–O pairs involved in the cation–anion
ionic couples, as extracted by the AIMD bulk simulations. As we have
shown above, the anion–cation O–O H-bond is, apart from
being electrostatic, the main structuring feature of the bulk fluids.
The data are reported in Figure 4 and their purpose is to show, once again, how the
anion–cation binding motif is the same along the series of
amino acid liquids. The average O–O distance is substantially
a constant throughout the amino acid series with a small difference
for [Asp] and [Glu], where it turns out to be slightly larger, indicating
a somewhat reduced interaction (in accord with the data of Table 1). In Table 3, the O–O RDF maximum
distances are compared to those obtained from the ab initio optimization
of the anion–cation pair seen above.

Figure 4 Cation–anion oxygen–oxygen
RDFs from AIMD bulk simulations of several amino acid liquids. The
atoms involved are the oxygen of the hydroxyl on choline and the oxygen
on the (deprotonated) carboxylate of the amino acid.

His	2.71	2.60	
Asp	2.70	2.68	
Glu	2.66	2.68	
Cys	2.66	2.62	
By looking at these data alone, the
great difference in internal friction and viscosities is completely
unexplained. The reduced interaction in the [Glu] and [Asp] ionic
couples should even point to a reduced friction in these systems which,
instead, show the highest viscosities and the highest melting temperatures.14 The differentiation in bulk properties should
therefore arise from somewhere else.

To understand the extent
to which anion–anion interactions can play a role in this additional
stabilization, we shall discuss in the following the RDF between the
anionic centers-of-mass as extracted from the molecular dynamics simulations.
These RDFs are a rough measure of how far the anions find themselves
in the liquid with respect to each other. We begin by showing in Figure 5 the anion–anion
RDF for the amino acids with an aliphatic side chain. As we are dealing
with bulky anions, all distances are large, but we can clearly see
that in the case of [Val], the RDF shows a profile with a peak just
above 5 Å. This peak exists also, albeit to a lesser extent,
for [Nva] and [Nle]. [Pro], [Ile], and [Leu], instead, have a RDF
profile that seems to imply a purely repulsive interaction between
anions. [Ala] represents a kind of special case, where the presence
of anion–anion distances below 5 Å might be a peculiar
consequence of its small size. To further elucidate the situation,
we can safely assume that the only possible interanionic contact comes
from H-bonds between two amino groups or between an amino group and
a carboxylate. We report in Figure 6 the N–N and N–O RDFs between the anions
for three different amino acid representatives of the behavior seen
above. The sharp peak at about 3 Å (red line) in [Val] and [Ala]
points to the presence of a N–O (amino-carboxylate) H-bond,
which in turn shows that anions (even in the case of the less bulky
[Ala] compound) can interact directly without the mediation of a cation.
In these two liquids, the amino group shows hints of an interaction
with the same group of another anion (black curves/points). [Pro][Ch],
on the other hand, does not show such interactions in accord with
the positive anion–anion binding energy reported in Table 2. The viscosity of
the [Pro][Ch] liquid with respect to [Ala][Ch], therefore, seems to
be due to other mechanisms of interactions, probably involving dispersion
forces.

for several amino acid-based liquids.

Figure 6 N–N and N–O interanionic RDFs for [Ala] (left), [Pro]
(center), and [Val], right.

A second set of anion–anion RDF is reported in Figure 7, where we can see
the behavior of the amino acid with nonaliphatic side chains. A compact
arrangement of anions can be noted for [His], where the average anion–anion
distance is only slightly above 5 Å, as in [Ala], despite the
much bigger size of the molecular ions. The anionic clustering in
these fluids takes place via H-bond formation, as in the previous
cases. In particular, in Figure 8 (on the left), we show the [His] interanionic N–O
and N–N RDFs, where we see the clear imprints of the presence
of interanionic interactions between the imidazole group and the heteroatoms
of another anion. For [His], the interaction is mainly with the carboxylate
(red curve/dots), where the acceptor–donor distance is 2.6
Å, thereby pointing to a rather strong H-bond. This interanionic
coupling mechanism between the ionic moieties in the [His][Ch] fluid
can be easily put in relation with the high viscosity of the liquid,
as shown in Figure 1. It is interesting to note that the H-bond donor ability of the
imidazole NH group is almost completely expressed toward the carboxylate,
whereas the N–N H-bonding between two imidazoles (blue dots)
is suppressed. An example of the anionic aggregation of two [His]
anions is provided in Figure 9 using a dimer as extracted from one frame of our AIMD simulation.

side chain hydroxyl are also shown.

simulation connected through an imidazole–carboxylate H-bond.

In the middle panel of Figure 8, we report a set
of data pertaining to the [Ch][Thr] liquid, where the additional hydroxyl
on the side chain allows for a total of three different H-bonding
features between anions. The hydroxyl groups can establish connections
toward the amino group (black), the carboxylate (red), and among themselves
(blue). Also in the [Thr] case, all of these H-bonds are quite strong
with an acceptor–donor distance ranging from of 2.6–2.8
Å. This network of H-bonds gives rise to a very complex structure
where chains of molecular anions are bound together. The peculiar
structure of [Thr][Ch] is shown pictorially in Figure 10 by means of a surface representation of
three snapshots of the simulation box taken at different times. The
surface enclosing the anions (red) clearly shows aggregation phenomena
on the nanoscopic scale, whereas the surface enclosing cations (blue)
show that almost all molecular cations are isolated from each other.

three snapshots of the AIMD simulation: anion density in red, cation
density in blue. (Bottom) One of the anionic trimers identified in
the simulation box with its H-bonds.

The [Phe][Ch] liquid (Figure 8, right panel), instead, provides an example where
both N–N and the N–O interanionic H-bonds play a role,
albeit the latter is predominant in strength and coordination ability,
as shown by the sharpness of the relative peak (red dots in Figure 8).

To conclude
this section, we now move to the analysis of the last group of amino
acid anions, i.e., those reported in the right panel of Figure 7. [Cys], [Asp], and [Glu] possess
an additional acidic function on the side chain (whose acidity in
terms of pKa’s is very weak for
[Cys], weak for [Asp] and [Glu]). The structure of these compounds
is therefore complicated by the fact that the proton on these acidic
functions is not stable but can move to other anions.37

In [Cys][Ch], the main anionic aggregation is due
to a weak (and quite elongated) S–S interaction, as shown in Figure 11 where we also
see that the S–O and S–N interactions have only a limited
extent in the fluid. This S–S interaction coupled to the one
between amino groups and carboxylates (right panel in Figure 11) induces the presence of
large anionic aggregates. Within these aggregates, proton transfer
is possible, as shown by the two snapshots reported in Figure 12, where two of the S–H
protons have moved onto a nearby amino group (one within the same
molecule). The proton transfers have created two positively charged
−NH3+ groups, whose H-bond has shortened
increasing its strength.

Figure 11 [Cys][Ch] interanionic RDFs.

Figure 12 Anionic clustering in [Cys][Ch]: two snapshots of an anionic
cluster (four [Cys] anions) as detected in the AIMD simulation, where
all other molecules have been removed from the representation for
clarity. Two proton transfers have taken place between the two snapshots
in going from left to right (one intermolecular and one intramolecular).

Finally, we observe the peculiar
structure of the liquids containing [Asp] and [Glu]. They are similar
in properties, as they both have an acidic proton on the side chain.
Both compounds are very viscous even at 80 °C,14 and both have high melting points. In the simulations,
we have implicitly assumed that only one of the carboxylate protons
has been removed because a complete deprotonation leads to solid compounds.14

The elusive proton transfer noted in the
[Cys] case, here turns out to be an important chemical process that
alters the structure and dielectric properties of the bulk. From the
point of view of a short-range structure, we see in Figure 13 that the [Asp] anions (left
panel) are in contact through mainly H-bonds that involve the OH (on
the nondeprotonated side chain) and the carboxylate of the amino group
(compare also Figure 3). It turns out that N–N and the O(carboxylate)–N contacts
are much less important. A density representation of the AIMD trajectory
(reported in Figure 14) clearly shows the nanoscopic anionic organization (in red) and
the corresponding lack of cation–cation interactions in much
the same way we have already found for the [Thr]-based liquid. An
example of a cluster of anions is also reported in Figure 14. In the [Glu] liquid, the
situation is not completely dissimilar, but we have found that the
presence of H-bonds between OH and the amino group is reduced.

5 Conclusions
The
aim of this work is to describe from a general point of view the microscopic
structure of complex ILs using a homologous series of compounds. Although
most of the traditional, aprotic ionic liquids are characterized by
a local structure that resembles a dynamical version of a crystalline
salt, the existence of hydrogen bonds makes a PIL a more complex environment.
It was rather surprising that a set of ILs, all synthesized using
the same cation and slight variation of a substituent on the anion
(the amino acid side chain), provided a remarkable variety of bulk
behaviors in terms of fluid states and frictional properties. Obviously,
this huge difference in the bulk state/properties had to come from
the variation of the anionic molecular constituents.

In particular,
we have seen (and reported here) that the main binding motif between
anions and cations is rather similar for all different amino acids
involved. This motif involves a strong OH–O hydrogen bond between
the cation hydroxyl and the negatively charged carboxylate on the
anions. The anion–cation dimer binding energies are almost
the same for all amino acids, thereby leading us to conclude that
the above differences must stem from somewhere else.

In the
last few years we have been accumulating evidence that the PILs under
investigations might present an unusual behavior in many respects:
(i) amino acid anions do interact through hydrogen bonds; (i) these
anions can undergo tautomerization, as neutral amino acid molecules
do, creating a sort of anionic–zwitterionic molecular species;
(ii) amino acid anions when interacting may also undergo intermolecular
proton transfer. We have, therefore, devoted this work to the quantification
and description of the interanionic interactions. This has been achieved
by means of an accurate evaluation of the binding energies of the
anionic dimers and through a novel analysis of several MD simulations,
which we had performed (and sometimes already illustrated) previously.
We have presented computational evidence that the frictional properties
of this class of liquids could be linked to their ability to form
additional H-bonding features. We have also shown that, remarkably,
these H-bonding features tend to cluster the anionic moieties, giving
rise to a variety of interanionic interactions, whose strength and
properties depend strongly on the side chain chemical properties.
It, therefore, follows that one must be aware of the existence of
strong interanionic interactions when dealing with such fluids (or
at least a subset of them) and that an understanding of their local
structure cannot be simply obtained by ionic couple modeling or other
over-simplified (two-body) models. In addition, we suggest that the
interpretation of anomalous or unexpected experimental data pertaining
to this class of materials should not be conducted under the assumption
that the ionic moieties live in separated domains but that the spatial
contiguity of interacting anions could provide the driving forces
for the formation of a nonobvious structural and chemical organization.

6 Computational Methods
Ab initio static calculations
have been performed on the isolated (anion–cation) ionic couples
made by an amino acid anion (13 variants) and a choline cation (see
ref (35) for analogous
computations) and on the anionic dimer made by 2 identical deprotonated
amino acids. For each combination, the calculations have been performed
both in the gas phase and in a polarizable continuum solvent model
(PCM). As the dielectric permittivity of these compounds has not been
reported in the literature so far, acetonitrile has been employed
as a model solvent, given that its dielectric constant has the typical
value of PILs.36 We have shown previously37 that the actual value of the dielectric constant
is a rather insensitive parameter, given that the relative stability
of the amino acid anion isomers does not appear to change upon its
significant variation in a rather large range from 20 to 80. For each
dimer, we have optimized the structure and evaluated the harmonic
frequencies using three functionals: B3LYP, D3-B3LYP,38 and D3-B2PLYP39 all with the
6-311+G** basis set (except for [Phe] where the smaller 6-31+G** was
used to perform the rather intensive B2PLYP frequency computations).
The Gaussian1640 package has been used
for all calculations. The 13 amino acid structures and their conventional
names are reported in Figure S1.

Several papers by us10−12 have appeared recently in the literature where we
have presented AIMD results on various compounds. These data will
be used in this paper as an additional source of information that
allows drawing a connection between the static calculations and the
bulk phase. The AIMD bulk simulation on the [Glu][Ch] anion, which
have not been presented before, has been done using the Car–Parrinello
molecular dynamic41 code using a cell with
a side length of 20.5 Å containing 24 ionic pairs. Car–Parrinello
molecular dynamics has been performed employing the BLYP functional
and Troullier–Martins42 pseudopotentials.
The production time was 33 ps at 300 K with a constant density of
1.14 gr/cm3. For comparison, the simulation parameters
and protocols of all other systems are reported in Table S1.
