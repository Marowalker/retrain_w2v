Photocatalytic oxidation treatment is an emerging and
fast developed
eco-friendly, energy-saving, and efficient advanced oxidation technology
for degrading hazardous pesticides. The conventional chemical detection
to evaluate the effects for this process depends on the broken chemical
structure, only giving residual content and product chemical composition.
However, it misses direct visual detection on the toxicity and the
quantitative analysis of pesticide detoxification. Here, we develop
a novel strategy to combine photocatalytic oxidation with a zebrafish
biological model to provide a direct visual detection on the environmental
detoxification. The mortality or deformity of zebrafish embryos (ZEs)
acts as an indicator. Over the irradiation duration threshold, the
mortality of ZEs decreases to 23.3% for pure chlorothalonil (CTL-P)
after photocatalytic oxidation treatment for 1 h, and the deformity
reduces to 13.3% for commercial CTL (CTL-C) after 30 min and to 3.33%
for tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD) after 20 min. The toxicity
of CTL-C and TMTD could be completely removed by photocatalytic oxidation
treatment and causes no damage to the ZE developmental morphology.
Chemical analyses demonstrate the degradation of CTL into inorganic
compounds and TMTD into small organic molecules. Among these highlighted
heterogeneous photocatalysts (g-C3N4, BiVO4, Ag3PO4, and P25), g-C3N4 exhibits the highest photocatalytic detoxification for CTL-P,
CTL-C, and TMTD.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Chlorothalonil (2,4,5,6-tetrachloro-1,3-benzenedicarbo-nitrile,
CTL), a broad-spectrum organochlorine pesticide, is extensively used
in agriculture, horticulture, and other applications as a protectant,
bactericide, and mildewcide.1−3 However, it is known as an acute
and chronic toxic carcinogen and teratogen according to World Health
Organization classification of hazards.2,4,5a,5b In China, the production
of CTL reaches 8.0 × 106 kg/year, whereas in the United
States, it is approximately 5.0 × 106 kg/year and
growing year by year.1,5a,6 The
half-life of CTL ranges from several days to 1 year in soil3 and 8 to 220 days under different concentrations
in water and seasonal conditions.5 Upon
degradation, it produces a series of metabolites such as 2,4,5-trichloroisophthalonitrile,
2,5,6-trichloro-4-methoxyisophthalonitrile, 4-hydroxychlorothalonil,
1-carbamoyl-3-cyano-4-hydroxy-2,5,6-trichlorobenzene, and 1,3-dicarbamoyl-2,4,5,6-tetrachlorobenzene.1,7−9 It is considered that the displacement of chlorine
into the hydroxyl group (−OH)1 and
the oxidation/hydration of the cyano group (−CN)10 produce 4-hydroxychlorothalonil, which is more
stable and more toxic than its parent compound.9,11

Thiram (tetramethylthiuram disulfide, TMTD), a dimethyl dithiocarbamate
compound, is widely used as a pesticide in crop protection. It is
also used as an animal repellent to protect ornamental plants and
fruit trees from animal foraging. In the rubber industry, TMTD is
used as a vulcanizing agent and an accelerator for rubber. It is also
used in cosmetics and biomedical fields. It can be slightly soluble
in water and strongly adsorb on soil particles with a certain durability.
The acidity of the soil has a great influence on the degradation of
TMTD. TMTD can be completely decomposed within 14–15 weeks
at pH 7, and at pH 3.5, it takes 4–5 weeks. The final decomposition
products in soil are copper dimethyldithiocarbamate, dimethylamine,
and carbon disulfide. Under acidic condition, TMTD can be degraded
completely in water through photolysis. Simultaneously, the formation
of CS2 causes toxicity in liver and damages skin, eyes,
and respiratory tract, although CS2 is not carcinogenic.
TMTD is highly toxic to fishes.12 Therefore,
it is of great importance to develop eco-friendly and efficient methods
to eliminate these hazardous pesticide residues.

Several methods,
such as microbial degradation, photocatalysis,
photolysis, Fenton reaction, ultrasonic irradiation, and hydrolysis,
have been developed and evaluated.3,8 Bahnemann and
Kaneco et al. utilized the traditional P25 to degrade pesticides and
detect the products by liquid chromatograms (liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry, LC/MS).13,14 The TiO2–PVA
polymer composite was used as a photocatalyst to degrade thiram, which
was completely eliminated within 150 min under visible light.15 ZnO and Ag3PO4 were used
as photocatalysts to degrade TMTD, and 0.01 g L–1 of TMTD was completely degraded by 0.25 g L–1 of
ZnO nanoparticles within 6 h under sunlight irradiation.16 Moreover, over 90.0% of fungicide sodium o-phenyl phenolate were decomposed by 1.6 g L–1 of Ag3PO4 within 2 h under sunlight.17 Wu et al. found a biological photocatalytic
cooperative treatment with pseudomonas and TiO2 for CTL
removal, eliminating over 90% of CTL after 7 days.8 Fe3+/H2O2 has been shown
to remove 71.7% of CTL (2 mg L–1) within 60 min
in a Fenton reaction.18 Ozonation,19 FeGAC/H2O2,20 and TiO2/H2O221 are effective advanced oxidation techniques
in the mineralization of CTL into CO2, H2O,
and NH3.19,22,23 Singh et al. controlled the release of TMTD by synthesizing supramolecular
beads containing a certain proportion of kaolin and bentonite, which
can be used for the safe handling of thiram.24 Additionally, Jiang et al. summarized many kinds of microbes with
functions of degrading various pesticides.25Stenotrophomonas acidaminiphila BJ1,
epigallocatechin gallate, Bacillus subtilis WB800, and procyanidolic oligomers were also applied to reduce CTL
residues.3,10,26,27

Presently, as one of the most convenient vertebrate
developmental
biology models, zebrafish (Danio rerio) shows great advantages in detecting environmental and pathological
toxicology.28,29 Zebrafish is a small tropical
fish with the following characteristics: (1) large amount of spawning
throughout a year, (2) early embryonic development and incubation
time being approximately 2–3 days, (3) transparent embryo body
making it easy to be observed directly under a microscope, and (4)
a common method to identify the genes and the genome project.1,2,30,31

Zhu et al. used the zebrafish to examine the developmental
toxicity
of metal oxide nanoparticles released into the aquatic environment.
The toxicological effects of nanoscale ZnO, TiO2, and Al2O3 aqueous suspensions on zebrafish embryos (ZEs)
and larvae were compared, and the developmental toxicity of the bulk
counterparts was also considered. The results are as follows: ZnO
is the most toxic substance in ZEs and larvae.32 Bai et al. demonstrated that nano-ZnO killed ZEs (50 and
100 mg L–1), retarded the embryo hatching (1–25
mg L–1), reduced the body length of larvae, and
caused tail malformation after the 96 hpf exposure. Comparative experiments
showed that nano-ZnO at high concentrations of 10–100 mg L–1 led to a more severe inhibition of embryonic development
than the corresponding concentrations of Zn2+ (>3.63
mg
L–1), suggesting that dissolved Zn species only
partially contributed to the toxicity of nano-ZnO.33 In contrast to visual toxicity detection by zebrafish,
and the conventional chemical detection to evaluate the effects for
the degradation process depends on the chemical structure broken of
pesticides. It can only detect the residual content and chemical composition
of products after pesticide degradation. However, it misses a direct
visual detection on the toxicity of the photocatalyst and the extent
of detoxification for pesticides, especially the degree of biological
response and damage to directly show the toxicity to the organism.

Here, we develop a novel strategy to combine photocatalytic oxidation
with a zebrafish biological model to provide a direct visual detection
on the environmental detoxification for different photocatalysts (g-C3N4, BiVO4, Ag3PO4, and P25). The spine of zebrafish is normally straight, whereas
low toxic pesticides malformed the embryo development, resulting in
a curved spine, and high toxic pesticides directly cause the death
of ZEs. The mortality and deformity of ZE can be visually identified
by optical microscopy. Together with gas chromatography/MS (GC/MS)
or high-performance liquid chromatography/MS (HPLC/MS), the residual
concentrations and degradation products of pesticides were analyzed.
The results show that over the irradiation duration threshold, the
mortality of ZE decreased to 23.3% for pure CTL (CTL-P) after photocatalytic
oxidation treatment for 1 h, and the deformity reduced to 13.3% for
commercial CTL (CTL-C) after 30 min and to 3.33% for TMTD after 20
min. The toxicity of CTL-C and TMTD could be completely removed by
photocatalytic oxidation treatment and causes no damage to the ZE
developmental morphology. Chemical analyses demonstrate the degradation
of CTL into inorganic compounds and TMTD into small organic molecules.
Among these highlighted heterogeneous photocatalysts, g-C3N4 exhibits the highest photocatalytic oxidation activity
for the detoxification of CTL-P, CTL-C, and TMTD.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Direct Zebrafish Visual Detection on Environmental
Toxicity of Pesticides
Scheme 1 gives a straightforward illustration depicting the
idea of combining photocatalytic oxidation treatment with the zebrafish
biological model to provide a direct visual detection on the environmental
detoxification. In principle, the highly active oxygen-containing
radicals could oxidize the pesticides into CO2 and soluble
salts during the photocatalytic oxidation process. The spine of zebrafish
is normally straight, whereas low toxic pesticides malformed the embryo
development, resulting in a curved spine. Highly toxic pesticides
directly cause the death of ZEs. The mortality and deformity of the
ZE can be visually identified.

Scheme 1 Schematic Illustration of Photocatalytic
Detoxification for Hazardous
Pesticides and Biological Visual Detection by Deformity and Morality
of ZEs.
The environmental toxicity of CTL and TMTD was
first investigated
using zebrafish as a biological model. The lethal process of CTL-P
(0.01 mg mL–1) on ZEs occurs within 28 hpf, where
they all have died without hatching, indicating the high toxicity
of CTL-P to the organism. The biological response and visual indicators
are the malformation of the ZE tail end, the damage of the outer membrane
causing the cells or yolk sac to overflow, and the black dead cells
(Figure 1). After exposure
to 0.01 mg mL–1 of CTL-P for 16 hpf, we directly
observed a corroded outer membrane, leading to the overflow of cells
or yolk sac. In contrast, we observed the developmental tail and head
in the control embryos (Figure 1c). Further extending the postfertilization to 28 hpf, we
also observed that CTL-P faded these embryonic cells until the color
disappeared into black, denoting the final death of ZE cells, whereas
the control grew into a baby zebrafish.

2.2 Quantitative Evaluation on the Photocatalytic
Detoxification for CTL-P Using Mortality Rate versus Conventional
GC/MS Analysis
Observing the ZE death as a biological visual
indicator for the toxicity of CTL-P, we make a quantitative evaluation
on the detoxification of photocatalytic oxidation treatments for CTL-P
by comparing the mortality rate (%). To accurately present the statistic
results, 20 well-developed ZEs and 8 experimental groups including
one control were set up, and three parallel experiments were carried
out for each pesticide concentration, numbered deaths after ZE exposure
to pesticides for 72 h, and averaged for SPSS analysis, where P was considered to be statistically significant for P value < 0.05 and marked as “*” for unobvious
differences for P ≥ 0.05. The ZE mortality
rate was 11.67% in the control group [solution only contains dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO)], while it reached higher than 91.6% after exposure
to 0.01 mg mL–1 of CTL-P (Figure 2a). Regarding different photocatalysts, a
one-way ANOVA with a post-hoc Dunn’s test as independent variables
was conducted. The photocatalytic detoxification kinetics were evaluated
every 10 min by irradiating for 1 h. The CTL-P dispersion was taken
from the photocatalytic system, followed by centrifugation, and then
mixed with the ZE culture fluid for visual detection. After the addition
of g-C3N4 and UV–vis light irradiation,
the mortality rate still remains high above 90.0% in the early 30
min. Prolonging the irradiation time to 40 min, it decreases to almost
70.0%. When the irradiation is prolonged more, the mortality rate
becomes less, reducing to 23.3% after 60 min illumination (Figure 2b). Similar detoxification
kinetics occur for g-C3N4, BiVO4,
P25, and Ag3PO4; the mortality rate remains
high in the early stage of photocatalytic oxidation treatment (Figure 2c–e). After
an irradiation duration threshold (40 min), the mortality rate reduces
fast, indicating a concentration limit for the toxicity of CTL-P.
Below this toxicity concentration limit through photocatalytic oxidation
treatment, the mortality rate will obviously decrease until complete
detoxification under irradiation. Because of the distinct dispersion
attribute in solution (Table S1) and optical
absorption capability in the UV–vis spectrum, the photocatalysts
exhibit different detoxification effects, with a mortality rate of
48.3% for Ag3PO4, 53.3% for BiVO4, and 83.3% for P25 under the same irradiation conditions (Figure 2f).

The conventional GC/MS analysis was also used to
probe the concentration
change and degradation production of the CTL-P solution after photocatalytic
oxidation treatment for 1 h with an intention to verify the conclusions
from biological visual detection. Figure 3 shows a retention time of CTL at 8.66 min
and the corresponding MS data. The response value of CTL-P is approximately
3.61 × 108, which corresponds to the 5.40 × 108 peak area and a strong abundance CTL ratio of about 4.51
× 107 at 265.8 m/z (mass-to-charge ratio). In comparison, the abundance ratio gives
a 16.89 times reduction after irradiation solely under UV–vis
(Xe lamp) light. A 1119.11 times reduction was further observed after
photocatalytic oxidation treatment by g-C3N4 under UV–vis light irradiation, indicating the effective
decomposition of CTL-P (Figure 3b). The degradation products of CTL after photocatalytic oxidation
treatment are inorganic compounds (m/z of 44.1). For different photocatalysts, the abundance ratio gives
an order of g-C3N4 > Ag3PO4 > BiVO4 > P25 according to the lowering
extent with 738.13
times for Ag3PO4, 255.71 times for BiVO4, and 111.91 times for P25 (Figure S3b–d). Obviously, the conventional GC/MS gives an assessment result for
different photocatalysts after photocatalytic oxidation treatment,
which is completely similar to the one by the visual ZE death. In
addition, the significance of biological visual detection is the more
efficiently and conveniently evaluation on the detoxification effects
and identify the detoxification capability for various photocatalysts
as well.

the peak retention time of CTL.

2.3 Quantitative Evaluation on the Photocatalytic
Detoxification for CTL-C and TMTD Using Deformity Rate versus Conventional
GC/MS and HPLC/MS Analyses
To further demonstrate the wide
applicability of zebrafish as a direct visual detection for photocatalytic
detoxification, we examined another two available commercial CTL (CTL-C)
and TMTD pesticides. Figure 4 shows the representative process of ZE from an initial normal
state to the embryonic spine deformity and finally to the larva fish
curved spine after exposure to CTL-C for 52 hpf. The observing ZE
growth to larva fish indicates the low toxicity of CTL-C in comparison
to that of CTL-P. However, CTL-C and TMTD still lead to the teratogenesis
of the zebrafish with a curved spine, indicating that the toxicity
is strongly dependent on the kind and concentration of the hazardous
pesticides.

Figure 4 Representative images of lifetime of the ZE (4–52 hpf) exposure
to CTL-C (6.25 μg mL–1) (a–c). Control
embryos: (d–f).

For the evaluation of photocatalytic detoxification
for CTL-C,
observing malformed zebrafish with a curved spine and tail as the
biological visual indicators for the toxicity of CTL-C, we make a
quantitative assessment on the photocatalytic detoxification for CTL-C
by comparing the deformity rate (%). Similarly, the malformed zebrafish
deformity rate is less than 10% in the control group, while it is
almost 100% after exposure to 6.25 μg mL–1 of CTL-C (Figure 5a). The photocatalytic detoxification kinetics for g-C3N4 indicate that the deformity rate still remains high
(nearly 100.0%) in the early 20 min. Prolonging the irradiation time
to 30 min, it begins to descend to 13.33%. When the irradiation is
prolonged more, the deformity rate becomes less, which reduces to
0 after 60 min (Figure 5b). The irradiation duration threshold for decreasing the deformity
rate depends on the photocatalysts, with 20 min for g-C3N4, 30 min for Ag3PO4, and 50 min
for BiVO4 and P25. The photocatalytic detoxification effects
for these highlighted photocatalysts give a deformity rate of 0 for
g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4, 11.67%
for BiVO4, and 30.0% for P25 under the same irradiation
for 60 min (Figure 5c–f). More visual lines of evidence are shown by the cartilage
staining, where the straight spine is recovered after exposure to
CTL-C detoxification by g-C3N4, in comparison
with the curved spine after exposure to CTL-C (Figure 7a–c).

rate of the ZE exposure to CTL-C solutions after photocatalytic oxidation
treatment. (a) CTL-C (6.25 μg mL–1), (b) g-C3N4, (c) BiVO4, (d) P25, (e) Ag3PO4, and (f) photocatalytic detoxification effects of
typical photocatalysts under Xe lamp irradiation for 60 min, where
DMSO is the control, * represents significant differences (P < 0.05).

For TMTD, the malformed zebrafish deformity rate
is less than 10%
in the control group, while it is almost 100% after exposure to 0.121
mg mL–1 of TMTD (Figure 6a). The photocatalytic detoxification kinetics
for g-C3N4 indicate that the deformity rate
still remains high (nearly 100.0%) in the early 10 min. Prolonging
the irradiation time to 20 min, it begins to descend to 3.33%. When
the irradiation is prolonged more, it reduces to 0 after 60 min (Figure 6b). The irradiation
duration threshold for decreasing the deformity rate is 10 min for
g-C3N4, 30 min for Ag3PO4, and 50 min for BiVO4 and P25. The photocatalytic detoxification
effects for these highlighted photocatalysts give a deformity rate
of 0 for g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4, 18.33% for BiVO4, and 45.0% for P25 under the same irradiation
for 60 min (Figure 6c–f). For more clear comparison of the photocatalytic detoxification,
we present the typical zebrafish morphology (76 hpf) exposure to TMTD
after photocatalytic oxidation treatment for 20 min. For g-C3N4, the morphology of zebrafish exhibits no difference
compared to the control (Figure 7d–f). However, the zebrafishes
with the curved spine were observed for Ag3PO4, BiVO4, and P25. This result indicates that the toxicity
of TMTD could be completely removed by photocatalytic oxidation treatment
and causes no damage to the developmental morphology of ZEs (Figure 8a–e).

of CTL-C (f) and TMTD (g) for different photocatalysts.

As mentioned above, conventional GC/MS analysis
was also used to
examine the residual concentration after photocatalytic oxidation
treatment for 1 h. CTL-C solution was pretreated by diluting 100 times
before the GC/MS test. The results show the retention time of CTL
at 8.66 min and the actual concentration of CTL-C of 6.25 μg
mL–1. After 60 min irradiation, the concentration
of CTL-C changes to 0.98 μg mL–1 for g-C3N4, 1.04 μg mL–1 for Ag3PO4, 1.59 μg mL–1 for BiVO4, 2.27 μg mL–1 for P25, and 4.39 μg
mL–1 without a photocatalyst (Figure S4 and Table S2). The C/Co plot also clearly presents
the contribution from different photocatalysts to degrade CTL-C. Because
of the different boiling point of TMTD, HPLC/MS was utilized to separate
and detect TMTD. Similarly, the TMTD solution was pretreated by diluting
100 times for the measurement. The initial actual concentration is
121.12 μg mL–1 and changes to 0.01 μg
mL–1 for g-C3N4, 0.03 μg
mL–1 for Ag3PO4, 0.71 μg
mL–1 for BiVO4, 12.98 μg mL–1 for P25, and 39.22 μg mL–1 without a photocatalyst (Table S2). The C/Co plot gives the photocatalyst
activity for degrading TMTD. These results provide strong lines of
evidence to support the fact that the toxicity depends on the pesticide
concentration, and the detoxification effect appears only over this
concentration threshold. In this perspective, it is a big advantage
of biological visual detection over the conventional chemical analysis
with the complicate pretreatment process to indicate the toxicity
intension and evaluate the detoxification efficiency.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we develop
a biological visual detection with ZEs to
evaluate pesticide detoxification during photocatalytic oxidation
treatment. The mortality and deformity of ZEs act as quantitative
indicators for analyzing the photocatalytic detoxification. Over the
irradiation duration threshold, the mortality and deformity rate reduce
fast, and the toxicity of pesticides can be completely removed by
photocatalytic oxidation treatment. Compared to the conventional chemical
analysis, it provides more efficient and convenient evaluation techniques
for the photocatalytic detoxification toward hazardous pesticides.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Reagents
All reagents
were of analytical grade and used as received. Sodium phosphate dibasic
anhydrous (Na2HPO4, 99.0%) and urea (99.0%)
were provided by Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. CTL-P (98.0%),
CTL-C (75%), TMTD (97%), DMSO, titanium dioxide (P25, 99.0%), bismuth
vanadium oxide (BiVO4, 99.0%), and silver nitrate (AgNO3, 99.8%) were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.
Ltd.

4.2 Preparation of g-C3N4 and Ag3PO4
Urea (20 g) was ground
into powder and dried at 80 °C. The powder was then heated at
550 °C for 1 h to obtain a yellow powder, which was then rinsed
with nitric acid and deionized water, filtered, and dried to obtain
g-C3N4. Ag3PO4 was synthesized
by an ultrasonic method.34 AgNO3 (0.20 g) and 0.42 g of Na2HPO4 were dissolved
into 100 mL of deionized water, assisted by an ultrasonic treatment
for 15 min, centrifuged, and then dried at 80 °C in a vacuum
oven.

4.3 Experiment Methods
CTL-P (0.01 mg
mL–1) in DMSO solution was first prepared. In a
typical photocatalytic oxidation experiment, 10 mg of powder photocatalyst
was dispersed in 20 mL of 0.01 mg mL–1 CTL-P solution
by sonication. The suspension was irradiated by a 300 W Xe lamp under
magnetic stirring. CTL-P dispersion (1 mL) was taken out at every
10 min from the reaction systems, followed by centrifugation at 15 000
rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was exposed to ZEs as described below.
After 60 min, both CTL-C and CTL-P centrifuged after photocatalytic
oxidation treatment was detected by GC/MS and HPLC/MS for TMTD (0.121
mg mL–1).

4.4 Zebrafish Experiment
The zebrafish
(D. rerio, AB strain) was reared at
28.5 °C at a light/dark ratio of 14 h:10 h with a ratio of 2
males to 1 female and fed with general fish food. Embryos were collected
on the next day, and only well-developed embryos were selected under
a microscope.

After 4 h of post-fertilization (4 hpf), about
20 well-developed embryos in 3 cm Petri dishes with 5 mL of culture
fluid were treated with 5 μL of either CTL-C (0.00625 mg mL–1) and CTL-P (0.01 mg mL–1) or TMTD
(0.121 mg mL–1), mixed, and cultured in a 28.5 °C
incubator until observation. The morphological observation was performed
under the microscope. Eight experimental groups including one control
group were set up, and three parallel experiments were carried out
for each exposure concentration and averaged for analysis.

In
order to stain the cartilage, ZEs were first fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde
solution for no more than 24 h and washed twice with phosphate-buffered
solution for 1 h. The embryos were stained with Alican blue 8 GR at
room temperature for 6 h and then washed once with 95, 90, 80, 70,
50, and 20% ethanol and distilled water for 1 h each time. Next, after
adding 1.5 mg mL–1 protease K for 30–60 min,
the embryos were dipped in 0.5% KOH for 1 h and then washed with distilled
water. Finally, the embryos were fixed in 10–20% glycerol,
observed, and photographed.

4.5 Determination of Embryo Mortality and Deformity
Early-stage embryos were visually opaque and coagulated. End-stage
embryos without heartbeat and ceasing development were assumed to
be dead. The control group exhibited the normal development morphology
with a straight spine, whereas malformed zebrafish exhibited a curved
spine and tail.    

4.6 Characterization
The phase structures
of the prepared samples were determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
on a SmartLab 9 kW (Rigaku, Cu Kα, λ = 1.5406 Å).
Optical properties were determined by a UV–vis diffuse reflectance
spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 300) with BaSO4 as a reference.
The morphological observations of embryos were conducted via a MDG41
optical microscope. Agilent 7000D GC/MS was used to acquire gas chromatograms
and mass spectra of CTL. Agilent 1260/6420 HPLC/MS was used to acquire
liquid chromatograms and mass spectra of TMTD.
