Neural tissue engineering approaches
show increasing promise for
the treatment of neural diseases including spinal cord injury, for
which an efficient therapy is still missing. Encouraged by both positive
findings on the interaction of carbon nanomaterials such as graphene
with neural components and the necessity of more efficient guidance
structures for neural repair, we herein study the potential of reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) microfibers as substrates for neural growth in
the injured central neural tissue. Compact, bendable, and conductive
fibers are obtained. When coated with neural adhesive molecules (poly-l-lysine and N-cadherin), these microfibers behave as supportive
substrates of highly interconnected cultures composed of neurons and
glial cells for up to 21 days. Synaptic contacts close to rGO are
identified. Interestingly, the colonization by meningeal fibroblasts
is dramatically hindered by N-cadherin coating. Finally, in vivo studies
reveal the feasible implantation of these rGO microfibers as a guidance
platform in the injured rat spinal cord, without evident signs of
subacute local toxicity. These positive findings boost further investigation
at longer implantation times to prove the utility of these substrates
as components of advanced therapies for enhancing repair in the damaged
central neural tissue including the injured spinal cord.

1 Introduction
Reduced
graphene oxide (rGO) is characterized by the presence of
a variable amount of oxygen-containing functional groups (mainly hydroxyls
and epoxies) in the closely packed honeycomb lattice of sp2-bonded carbon atoms.1 These groups significantly
enhance its hydrophilicity and adsorptive properties, thus boosting
its utility in diverse biomedical applications, such as drug/gene
delivery, bioimaging, biosensing, stem cell differentiation, and photothermal
therapy, to cite a few.2−4 More recently, increasing work is noting its attractive
potential for the design of neural interfaces for recording/stimulating5 and, more rarely, regenerative medicine including
neural tissue engineering.6,7 In these lines, advances
in the development of more efficient neural interfaces would significantly
impact society,8 as the incidence of lesions
affecting the nervous tissue (e.g., spinal cord injury, peripheral
nerve loss, and Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases)
is increasing. Although the toxicity of graphene-derived materials
is still an open debate,9 most studies
support the existence of a safe range of concentrations for their
use in biological scenarios.10 When evaluated
with neural cells in vitro, positive findings from hybrid structures
with silica nanoparticles11 and nanogrids,12 among others, prompt further investigation of
these materials. In the nervous tissue in vivo, graphene behaves as
a permissive material not only for neuron and astrocyte growth but
also for neurogenesis.13 Recent studies
by our group have also demonstrated the ability of rGO in the shape
of porous 3D scaffolds to mediating immunomodulatory and angiogenic
responses, along with axonal growth, in the injured rat spinal cord
after chronic implantation.14

The
configuration of graphene-derived materials in the shape of
fibers is being the focus of extensive research mainly because of
their practical relevance for applications such as conducting wires,
energy-related devices, actuators, and field emitters.15 Fabrication methodologies under investigation
are varied and generally comprise wet-spinning, dry-spinning, dry-jet
wet-spinning, electrophoretic self-assembly, and film conversion.16 In the context of neural repair, a few attempts
have been described. Recent work by Guo et al. pioneered the exploration
of rGO microfibers fabricated using a capillary hydrothermal methodology
for self-powered stimulation of mesenchymal stem cells toward neural
phenotypes when functionalized with poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiopthene)
(PEDOT)17 and for neural differentiation
of neural stem cells.18 Similarly, graphene-coated
electrospun poly(vinyl chloride) nanofibers demonstrated usefulness
as substrates for electrical stimulation of the growth of primary
motor neurons.19 Other studies regarding
electrical stimulation for neural differentiation include the exploration
of rolled GO foams.20 In a different work,
GO promoted the growth and alignment of PC-12 cells and Schwann cells
when used as a coating for aligned poly-l-lactide nanofibrous
scaffolds.21 Additional biomedical uses
of GO fibers include their interest as constituents of sensors.22

Current approaches for neural repair at
the central nervous system
include delivery of neurotrophic factors, drug and cell therapies,
and implantable biomaterials.23 At the
injured spinal cord, materials such as agarose,24 gelatin,25 and chitosan26 are under investigation as promising candidates,
although effective strategies are still missing. On the basis of biologically
positive responses of neural cells and tissues when in contact with
carbon nanomaterials,27 we herein investigated
the potential of rGO in the shape of microfibers as selective substrates
for neural tissue engineering with superior guidance performance due
to their 3D fibrillary architecture. First, the physicochemical properties
of the microfibers were carefully characterized, including morphology,
topography, surface chemical composition, conductivity, and flexibility.
After biological functionalization with poly-l-lysine and
N-cadherin, the in vitro behavior of cortical neural progenitor cells
and meningeal fibroblasts in culture on the microfibers was thoroughly
investigated by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy studies.
Finally, in vivo studies in the injured rat spinal cord were carried
out to both prove their feasible implantation and explore the subacute
tissue responses induced in vivo.

2 Results
and Discussion
GO sheets were obtained by chemical oxidation
of commercial graphite
powder as previously described.28 The resulting
GO sheets were then dispersed in distilled water (5 mg mL–1) and used for the fabrication of rGO microfibers by a one-step dimensionally
confined hydrothermal strategy.29 This
thermal process also allowed for the reduction of highly reactive
oxygen-containing groups in GO, which are thought to mediate cell
toxicity.30 In an attempt to achieving
significantly distinct redox states of the GO sheets, two dramatically
different temperatures (220 and 800 °C) were selected on the
basis of previous findings on thermal effects in graphite oxide.31 The morphology of the resulting free-standing
rGO microfibers was then characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) (Figure 1). As
can be observed, modifications in the heating time and temperature
used for the hydrothermal process resulted in microfibers with diverse
diameters and surface topographies. At 220 °C, all of the microfibers
obtained were compact, with diameters of 130.1 ± 0.02 μm
(220 °C, 15 min), 121.1 ± 4.99 μm (220 °C, 2
h), and 128.7 ± 3.59 μm (220 °C, 7 h), which displayed
no statistically significant differences (ANOVA-post hoc: p > 0.05). However, posterior thermal treatment at 800
°C
for 4 h significantly reduced the microfiber diameter (54.2 ±
3.51 μm, ANOVA-post hoc: p < 0.000***).
Microfibers formed at 220 °C for 7 h displayed more evident surface
holes, which conferred a more irregular topography and, necessarily,
a more fragile mechanical performance. The general trend of diameter
decrease observed in GO microfibers exposed to higher temperatures
and heating times could be related to the progressive reduction of
GO sheets and their subsequent more largely confined packing. Specifically,
GO sheets go from experiencing strong hydrophilicity and electrostatic
repulsion when randomly dispersed in water to become regionally hydrophobic
by exposure to the hydrothermal treatment. Hydrophobic and π–π
interactions lead then to 3D random stacking of flexible graphene
sheets.32 Slight nonsignificant differences
in microfiber diameter outside of this trend might be ascribed to
the critical microfiber drying process.

Figure 1 Morphological characterization
by SEM of rGO microfibers prepared
at different time and temperature conditions. Left image: microfiber
prepared at 220 °C for 2 h. Scale bars: 50 μm (left image),
100 μm (top), and 10 μm (bottom).

The electrical properties of these microfibers were then
explored
as the thermal treatment used for the coagulation of the GO sheets
in the pipeline was expected to increase their reduction state. Chronoamperometric
studies demonstrated a linear relation between intensity and voltage
(Figure 2A), with conductivity
values of 4.64 ± 0.90 S cm–1 (220 °C,
2 h). Interestingly, these values are in agreement with those previously
reported for rGO microfibers fabricated by similar methods on glass
pipelines.17,18,29,33 Although not explored in this work, this
finding paves the way for future benefits in the application of these
microfibers in electrostimulation protocols both in vitro20,34 and in vivo.35 As predicted, microfibers
obtained by a shorter thermal treatment (220 °C, 15 min) displayed
a slightly smaller conductivity (2.64 ± 0.47 S cm–1; t-test: p = 0.007**), whereas
those additionally exposed to a more severe thermal treatment (800
°C, 4 h) had significantly higher values (85.23 ± 8.54 S
cm–1; t-test: p < 0.000***) due to a significantly larger reduction degree achieved.31 To corroborate that this increase in conductivity
was related to GO reduction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
studies were performed (Figure 2B, Table S1, and Figure S2). A
progressive loss of oxygenated groups (−C–OH, O–C–O,
and O–C=O) was demonstrated as the thermal treatment
increased according to the following trend: pristine GO > rGO fiber
220 °C 15 min > rGO fiber 220 °C 2 h. Similarly, the
percentages
of Csp2 and Csp3 increased as well as the C/O
ratios. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies were then used to explore
the surface topography of the microfibers (Figure 2C,D). Specifically, root-mean-square (rms)
values of 45.23 ± 13.19 nm were obtained for those microfibers
prepared at 220 °C for 2 h. Finally, rGO microfiber flexibility
was explored using a semiquantitative bending test (Figure S3). Microfibers fabricated at 220 °C for 2 h
were able to sustain deformations without rupture for at least 105°
of bending, rarely achieved by any microfibers obtained using the
rest of preparation conditions tested in this study.

(C) Surface plot and (D) roughness profile by AFM.

For the subsequent biological studies in vitro
and in vivo, rGO
microfibers prepared at 220 °C for 2 h were selected due to their
more favorable properties including reproducibility (over 150 microfibers
prepared), rather than those fabricated at either longer heating times
(irregular in their surface morphology) or at a higher temperature
(too fragile). Initial studies demonstrated that bare microfibers
(devoid of any biological coating) were unable to support the growth
of embryonic neural progenitor cells (ENPCs) in vitro (Figure S4), even when previous work by others
proved the capacity of this type of microfibers to allow the growth
of mesenchymal stem cells and neural stem cells.17,18 Therefore, as a necessary step to mediate adhesion of these neural
cells, rGO microfibers were coated with either poly-l-lysine
(PLL) (adsorbed), conventionally used to favor neural-like cell adhesion,
or N-cadherin (either adsorbed, ADS, or covalently bond, COV), an
adhesion receptor able to enhance neural cell growth and survival
and involved in synapse formation and neuronal physiology.36 Modifications of the microfiber surface topography
induced by the biological coating were measured by AFM (Figure S5). Specifically, rms values of 7.01
± 2.92 and 10.72 ± 3.32 nm were measured for PLL- and N-cadherin-coated
microfibers, respectively. This result evidenced a significant smoothening
effect caused by the biofunctionalization in both cases (t-tests: p < 0.000***), as also observed in 2D
rGO films.28 The presence of these biomolecules
on the microfiber surface was further confirmed by XPS (Figure S5 and Table S1). Specifically, a significant
increase in both oxygen- and nitrogen-containing groups was detected.
Neither roughness profiles by AFM nor XPS spectra revealed significant
differences between ADS and COV microfibers. This finding is not surprising
as the most superficial layer was expected to be constituted by N-cadherin
molecules in both cases and both techniques provide information from
the material surface. Finally, the homogeneity of the biological coatings
was corroborated by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) (Figure S6).

We next explored the ability
of these biofunctionalized rGO microfibers
to support the formation of neural cultures in vitro both on their
surface and at their periphery. To maximize microfiber colonization
by cells without introducing additional materials of unknown response
with ENPCs, rGO microfibers were glued at their edges to glass coverslips
(conventionally used for cell culture), as illustrated in Figure S1. This glass substrate adjacent to the
microfibers worked as a necessary control of well-known behavior with
ENPCs for comparisons.28 ENPCs were seeded
on these substrates, and the cultures were maintained for up to 21
days to discard any deleterious effects caused by the substrates at
long culture times. SEM studies were then carried out to observe the
morphology of the cultures on the microfibers (Figure 3). The formation of highly interconnected
cultures was also corroborated on all of the coated microfibers (PLL,
ADS, and COV), with easily identifiable cell somas, neurites, and
extracellular matrix components. This supportive behavior of rGO microfibers
for neural cell growth is in agreement with previous results on the
use of micro- and nanofibers containing either rGO17,18 or graphene, even when simply used as a dopant37 or coating.19,21 For instance, GO-coated and aligned
poly(l-lactic acid) nanofibrous scaffolds significantly
improved the proliferation of rat pheochromocytoma 12 (PC-12) cells
and promoted their neural differentiation and neurite growth along
the nanofibers.21 These substrates also
enhanced Schwann cell proliferation and alignment in the presence
of nerve growth factor.21 In a different
approach, hybrid GO nanofibrous scaffolds were able to guide neural
stem cell differentiation toward oligodendrocytes,37 key players in myelination in the central neural tissue.
On the basis of the culture conditions used, we hypothesized that
a majority of the cells colonizing the microfibers likely migrated
from glass coverslip areas in close contact with the microfibers,
first reaching the lateral sides of the cylindrical microfibers and
then the very top areas, which typically appeared a bit less populated.
Although care was taken to preferentially seed the cells on top of
the microfibers, their curvature possibly prevented most of the cells
to adhere but roll over the fibers and first attach to the fiber lateral
sides and glass coverslip areas nearby instead. This hypothesis was
proven from cultures in which microfibers remained curved away from
the glass substrate and showed poor cell colonization (data not shown).

Figure 3 Representative
SEM micrographs illustrating ENPC cultures on rGO
microfibers coated with poly-l-lysine (PLL), adsorbed N-cadherin
(ADS), and covalently bond N-cadherin (COV) for 14 days. Scale bars:
100 μm (top), 20 μm (ADS and COV, bottom), and 10 μm
(PLL, bottom).

To further characterize
these ENPC cultures, immunofluorescence
studies of specific markers were carried out by CLSM. Figure 4A illustrates representative
images of ENPCs cultured on coated microfibers (PLL for 21 days; ADS
and COV for 14 days). Three-dimensional reconstructions of the z-stacks
of these microfibers are provided in the Supporting Information for facilitating the appreciation of the 3D colonization
of the substrates by the cells (Movies 1–3). As can be appreciated, both neurons (map-2+) and non-neuronal
cells including glial cells (vimentin+) were present on
the fibers, although PLL microfibers needed longer culture times (21
vs 14 days) to reach at least 50% of the microfiber surface covered
by neural cells under these culture conditions. After 21 days, neurons
covered 52 ± 13% of the PLL-coated microfiber surface, whereas
glial cells reached 62 ± 16%. In N-cadherin-coated microfibers,
values from 14-day cultures were 38 ± 12 and 35 ± 7% for
neurons and 41 ± 20 and 22 ± 2% for non-neuronal cells (ADS
and COV, respectively) (Figure 4B). Percentages overpassing 100% were the result of the high
confluence achieved in the cultures. Interestingly, in both PLL and
ADS microfibers, there was a higher prevalence of non-neuronal cells
(vimentin+) versus neurons, referred as covered area. In
all cases, axons extensively grew on the microfiber surface, reaching
percentages as high as 88% at day 14 (Figure S7). The positive charge conferred to the microfiber surface by the
amine groups of PLL (confirmed by XPS studies) is likely responsible
for this enhanced neural adhesion and branching, as previously reported
for functionalized GO films with hippocampal neurons.38 In the case of ADS and COV, the supportive effect on neural
cell growth found likely relies on the double beneficial role played
by N-cadherin, an adhesion molecule that links cytoskeleton components
across cell membranes and plays as a ligand-activated receptor capable
of initiating intracellular signaling cascades.36 Although both types of N-cadherin coatings supported ENPC
growth on the microfibers, a higher tendency to the fasciculation
of neurites (i.e., neurites gathered together as condensed bundles)
and cell clustering (i.e., concentration of cell bodies in groups)
was noticed in ADS microfibers, along with an enrichment in non-neuronal
cells. These phenomena, typically induced by nonpermissive substrates,
might be ascribed to the less stable binding of N-cadherin when adsorbed
to the surface rather than when covalently bond. Similar stability
issues were observed with several types of biodegradable nanoparticles
coated with lysosomal hydrolase arylsulfatase A (ASA).39 Three different binding procedures were compared:
adsorption, high-affinity binding via the streptavidin–biotin
system, and covalent binding. Interestingly, although adsorption allowed
higher amounts of ASA binding, rapid and complete desorption occurred
in the presence of phosphate buffer or serum as this binding involves
weak chemical forces such as electrostatics, hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic
interactions, and van der Waals forces. In contrast, stable immobilization
with negligible dissociation was achieved by high-affinity and covalent
binding, thus becoming more efficient for biomedical applications.
Interestingly, ENPCs cultured on PLL-coated glass coverslips evolved
to glial-like cell-enriched cultures after 21 days, faster than those
on PLL-coated rGO microfibers under the same culture conditions (4
± 1% of coverage by neurons and 26 ± 7% by non-neuronal
cells; t-tests: p < 0.000***)
(Figures 4B and S8, first column). On the basis of these findings,
parameters such as the 3D configuration and physicochemical properties
of the microfiber surface itself, besides their biological coating,
could be playing an additional role in the equilibrium between neurons
and non-neuronal cells at longer culture times. Additionally, a significant
influence of the electrical properties of rGO on these phenomena cannot
be discarded as the conductivity of graphene-derived materials has
been recently pointed out as a modulator of neural stem cell maturation,
with significant influence on membrane electrical parameters, spine
density, and synaptic activity.40 In these
lines, further studies of these microfibers in contact with neural
components including electrical stimulation procedures both in vitro
and in vivo will be the focus of future work. In all immunofluorescence
studies, any interference of the rGO microfiber on the fluorescence
signals detected was neglected by simultaneous immunofluorescence
controls (Figure S9).

microfibers by CLSM. (A) Left column, neurons are labeled for map-2
(green) and non-neuronal cells including glial cells for vimentin

(red) and synapses for synaptophysin (green). Zoom-in images of the
microfibers (white squares) are also included. Cultures correspond

(t-tests, p ≤ 0.05).

Since early times, in neuroscience,
synapses have been recognized
as functional entities in neural connectivity by means of the establishment
of dendritic spines.41 Encouraged by recent
findings on the ability of graphene to increase spine density, synapse
protein expression, and synaptic activity,40 we next investigated the presence of synaptic contact components
in the ENPC cultures grown on the biologically coated rGO microfibers. Figure 4A (and Movies 4–6 in the Supporting Information)
also illustrates representative immunofluorescence images (and 3D
reconstructions) of the specific labeling of synaptophysin, a protein
related to the regulation of the kinetics of synaptic vesicle endocytosis
in central neurons.42 As can be appreciated,
highly numerous synaptic contacts showing a typical dotlike morphology
covered neuronal dendrites and somas (stained in red by simultaneous
labeling of map-2) on microfibers, without noticeable differences
among biological coatings. Further studies by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) aimed the characterization of the ultrastructure
of these neural cultures (Figure 5). Individual neural cells directly adhered to the
rGO microfiber surface were frequently identified (white asterisks),
as well as highly numerous cell processes. Importantly, direct contacts
with rGO were recurrently evidenced not only for cells but also for
their processes (yellow crosses). Structures with the appearance of
synaptic bottoms were also appreciated in close interaction with the
underlying rGO microfiber (red arrows). In line with these results,
recent findings have proven the ability of magnetic-force-driven GO
hybrid patterns containing magnetic nanoparticles to control the accumulation
and expression of synaptophysin in human neural cell cultures.43 As some recent findings have revealed certain
degree of biodegradability for GO,44 we
also focused on looking for ultrastructural cues of microfiber degradation.
Interestingly, neither signs of microfiber structure disassembly nor
degradation of the rGO sheets composing it was observed during the
21-day culture. Longer times are likely necessary for the observation
of such degradative features, according to a previous work with other
carbon-based materials such as carbon nanotubes.45

of ENPC cultures on rGO microfibers coated with biological molecules
(PLL, top; COV, bottom). Cells in contact with rGO (white asterisks),
direct contacts between cellular membranes and rGO (yellow crosses),
and synapses in close interaction with rGO (red arrows) are shown.
Zoom-in details of structures resembling synaptic bottoms are included
in the last column.

One of the first events
taking place at the injured central nervous
tissue is the rapid formation of inhibitory fibroglial scars that
withdraw reparative initiatives, both internal and external.46 To anticipate some insights into the tissue
response of these rGO microfibers when implanted in the injured nervous
tissue, we investigated in vitro their interaction with primary rat
meningeal fibroblasts, cells typically implicated in scar formation
and therefore detrimental for neural regeneration when present at
the injury site. As evidenced by SEM and CLSM, these cells were able
to attach to both bare and PLL-coated microfibers and grow at their
periphery without significant differences with control samples (Figure S10). On the contrary, N-cadherin significantly
hampered fibroblast cell growth. Importantly, similar effects were
found on the peripheral glass areas, thus pointing out N-cadherin
as the major factor responsible for this finding. Specifically, substrate
coverage reached values of 1.0 ± 1.6% on ADS and 1.4 ± 1.6%
on COV (5.6 ± 3.9 and 4.0 ± 3.4 for respective glass areas; t-tests between microfibers and glass substrates: nonsignificant).
Bare and PLL-coated rGO microfibers attained percentages of 34 ±18
and 25 ± 10%, respectively (57 ± 11 and 24 ± 15% for
respective glass coverslips; t-tests between microfibers
and glass substrates: nonsignificant) (comparisons among coatings
in rGO microfibers, ANOVA-post hoc: p = 0.001***).
This finding is not surprising given the specific role of N-cadherin
as an adhesion receptor able to enhance neural cell growth and survival
and involved in synapse morphogenesis and neuronal physiology.47 In line with our findings, Gao and colleagues
used neural cell adhesion molecule peptides to functionalize zwitterionic
polymer brushes to selectively control directional migration of Schwann
cells over fibroblasts.48 In a different
study, polar polymers bearing cationic charges favored adhesion of
glial cells and spiral ganglion neurons over fibroblasts.49

Boosted by the attractive physicochemical
properties of rGO microfibers
(facile fabrication, reproducibility, guidance architecture, flexibility,
and conductivity) and the positive findings in vitro with both ENPCs
and meningeal fibroblasts, we next explored the feasibility of implanting
these rGO microfibers as a guidance substrate in the injured rat spinal
cord. The model of selection for these studies was a lateral hemisection
(incomplete lesion at the right side of the spinal cord at C6), which
was intendedly selected mainly because it has been proved to provide
fair and accurate information about neural tissue responses while
hemisected animals retain a much better general condition after injury,
can deal with their handicaps more easily, and are maintained free
of the typical chronic complications of this type of lesion. To facilitate
implantation, bare rGO microfibers (without either biological coatings
or cultured cells) were embedded into a 3D gelatin hydrogel with the
dimensions of the injury site (Figure 6A). Typically, a total of 20 microfibers were embedded
inside each hydrogel. Prior to implantation, these hybrid scaffolds
were cross-linked by exposure to paraformaldehyde vapors to confer
mechanical stability to the gelatin polymer. Ex vivo, the resulting
scaffolds were stable in PBS at 37 °C for over 2 months (data
not shown). The bendable nature of these microfibers and the soft
consistence of the hydrogel were clear advantages that permitted an
adequate location in the injury site (Figure 6B). After 10 days of implantation, animals
were sacrificed to evaluate the early responses of the neural tissue
in close contact with the implant (subacute stage). Figure 6C shows representative immunofluorescence
images of specific markers at three locations: perilesional areas
at 1–2 mm from the injury, the interface tissue at the border
between structured neural tissue and the injury itself, and microfibers
at the very injury site. Respective quantitative data are included
in Figure 6D and compared
to those of control groups previously published in a similar experimental
model.6 Panoramic views of tissue sections
for all of these markers can be found in the Supporting Information
(Figure S11). As can be appreciated, perilesional
areas displayed abundant staining for conventional markers of neurons
(map-2 and tau) and astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP),
some positive labeling for vimentin+ and PDGFRβ+ cells (mainly associated with vascular structures and likely
representing pericytes), and an almost negligible presence of macrophages
(ED1+ cells) (differences not statistically significant
with respect to control neural tissue except for map-2, ANOVA-post
hoc: p < 0.000***). At the interface, conventional
markers of neurons were still present and coexisted with a slightly
higher but not significant abundance of those of reactive cells including
astrocytes, connective tissue cells, pericytes, and macrophages (GFAP,
PDGFRβ, and ED1, respectively; ANOVA-post hoc: p > 0.05 with respect to control and perilesional area in all cases).
In close contact with the rGO microfibers in the injury site, a majority
of cells stained positively for vimentin and PDGFRβ (ANOVA-post
hoc: p < 0.000*** and p = 0.125
with respect to control, respectively). Macrophages, although contacting
the microfiber surface, were less abundant than at the interface but
not significantly (ANOVA-post hoc: p = 0.723). Some
neuronal axons (tau+) were able to reach the proximities
of the microfibers, in some cases even spreading on the rGO surface.
Map-2+ and GFAP+ cells were rarely found in
the immediate periphery of the microfibers (ANOVA-post hoc: p < 0.000*** with respect to control and perilesional
areas for both markers). These results are in agreement with previous
findings on the subacute implantation of 3D rGO scaffolds,6 in which rGO sheets appeared also mainly colonized
by cells positive for vimentin, PDGFRβ, and ED1. Interestingly,
the implantation of rGO in the configuration of 3D microfibers embedded
in a gelatin hydrogel seemed to promote a more protective tissue response
than the injury alone, as demonstrated by lower percentages of cells
positive for vimentin, PDGFRβ, and ED1 and a higher presence
of those positive for tau (ANOVA-post hoc: p <
0.000***, p = 0.008**, and p <
0.000***, respectively). It is worth mentioning that graphene nanosheets
have demonstrated also biocompatible and permissive behaviors for
neurogenesis when implanted in the mouse olfactory bulb.13 In line with these findings, Collazos-Castro
et al. recently demonstrated the utility of carbon microfibers (7
μm in diameter) coated with PEDOT and biofunctionalized (by
using a multimolecular complex of PLL, heparin, basic fibroblast growth
factor, and fibronectin) for promoting tissue healing and enhancing
angiogenesis and axonal regeneration, without increasing inflammation,
in the injured rat spinal cord.50 Further
studies at longer implantation times (chronic state) will be necessary
to demonstrate the ability of rGO microfibers to enhancing neural
repair in the injured spinal cord and to identifying the origin of
the cells chronically invading the microfibers. Specifically, current
studies in our laboratory are focused on the implementation of the
implantation design by modifying the composition and degradation rate
of the supportive hydrogel and the functionalization of the microfibers
to better favor guidance effects.

To summarize, we have explored the usefulness of bendable
microfibers
exclusively composed of rGO as supportive guidance substrates for
neural growth both in vitro (by neural progenitor cell culture) and
in vivo (by implantation in the injured rat spinal cord). Highly interconnected
cultures of central neural cells were formed on the microfiber surface
when coated with adhesive biological molecules, such as poly-l-lysine and N-cadherin, but not in their absence. Additionally, by
coating with N-cadherin, the colonization of the microfibers by meningeal
fibroblasts was dramatically hindered. Finally, in vivo studies revealed
the feasible implantation of these rGO microfibers in the injured
rat spinal cord and their capacity to be colonized by cells without
evidencing signs of subacute local toxicity. These findings encourage
further investigation of these graphene-based microfibers at longer
implantation times as part of novel neuroregenerative biomaterials
for the treatment of lesions at the central nervous tissue including
spinal cord injury.

3 Methods
All materials
and biological samples in this study were manipulated
according to standard regulations, so no safety concerns arise.

3.1 Material
Chemical reagents and antibodies were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received, unless otherwise indicated.
Neurobasal media and B-27 supplement were purchased from Life Technologies.
All additional cell culture media supplements and reagents were obtained
from Lonza.

3.2 GO Synthesis and rGO Microfiber
Preparation and Characterization
GO sheets were obtained
by chemical oxidation of commercial graphite
powder as previously described.28 These
sheets were then dispersed in distilled water to a final concentration
of 5 mg mL–1. rGO microfibers were prepared as described
elsewhere29 and allowed to dry in air overnight.
Briefly, the GO suspension (0.5 wt %) was collected into standard
Hirschmann capillary tubes (of 1.35 mm inner diameter and 120 mm length),
which were thereafter sealed up at their ends. Different heating temperatures
and time conditions were investigated for the hydrothermal microfiber
preparation. Specifically, thermal treatments at 220 °C for 15
min, 2 h, and 7 h were compared. Some microfibers prepared at 220
°C for 2 h were additionally exposed to 800 °C for 4 h under
controlled N2 atmosphere conditions. Those microfibers
obtained at 220 °C for 2 h were selected for further biological
studies based on their more favorable physicochemical properties,
including reproducibility, flexibility, and homogeneity. The conductivity
of the microfibers was measured using a four-point probe methodology
with a 34401A Agilent 61/2 digit Multimeter (n ≥
5 per treatment group). Chronoamperometric measurements were performed
on dry microfibers glued to a four-point holder with colloidal graphite
using an Autolab Potentiostat/Galvanostat. The electrical current
passing through the microfibers was then monitored for fixed voltages
from 0.1 to 0.8 V (steps: 0.1 V, 100 ms), and measurements were taken
every 10 ms. In both cases, the current was introduced and collected
through the outer probes, whereas the voltage was measured and fixed
between the two inner probes (measurement distance: 0.23 cm). XPS
studies were performed using a K-Alpha (Thermo Scientific) electron
spectrometer equipped with an Al Kα (hυ = 1486.68 eV)
Watts X-ray source (12 KV and 6 mA) (n = 40 scans
for complete spectra, n = 75 for C 1s and O 1s and n = 300 for N 1s). The flood gun option was active during
the analyses for charge compensation, and the pressure in the analysis
chamber was maintained at 2.4 × 10–7 mbar.
The pass energy of the analyzer was set at 200 eV for complete spectra
and 40 eV for zone spectra. The binding energies were referenced to
the binding energy of the C 1s core-level spectrum at 285 eV. Data
processing was performed with the XPS peak-fit program in Advantage
4.87 software. Spectra were decomposed with the least-squares fitting
routine provided by the software with the Gaussian/Lorentzian (90/10)
product function and after subtracting a Shirley background. Atomic
fractions were calculated using peak areas normalized on the basis
of sensitivity factors provided by the manufacturer. Surface roughness
of the microfibers was studied by AFM (Bruker multimode Nanoscope
III A) (n ≥ 15 measurements per group). A
semiquantitative bending test was carried out by fixing rGO microfibers
to a stereotaxic device through their edges (n =
3). To drive deformation, a round-tip rod was pressed against the
center of the microfiber in a controlled manner.

3.3 rGO Microfiber Functionalization
rGO microfibers were
glued at their edges to conventional glass coverslips (12 mm in diameter)
using a medical-grade silicone elastomer (Nusil) and thereafter sterilized
by exposure to UV radiation for 30 min. Typically, a total of three
microfibers were glued to each coverslip with a separation distance
between microfibers of ∼2 mm (Figure S1). Then, substrates (glass coverslips + glued rGO microfibers) were
functionalized with either poly-l-lysine (PLL; adsorption,
45 μg mL–1) or N-cadherin (by either adsorption
or covalent bonding, ADS and COV, respectively). COV functionalization
was carried out using a protocol previously described for other type
of substrates.51 Briefly, substrates were
reacted with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (EDC, 45 mg mL–1) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS, 45 mg mL–1)
in distilled water for 1 h at 24 °C. After three rinses, substrates
were incubated in triethanolamine buffer solution for 1 h (50 mM,
pH 8.0) containing an IgG antibody against the Fc fragment of the
human IgG (100 mg mL–1). This antibody was dialyzed
through cellulose ester membranes prior to use. Next, substrates were
incubated with recombinant human N-cadherin (R&D Systems) at 10
mg mL–1 in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4)
for 1 h. After conjugation, substrates were carefully rinsed. Alternatively,
N-cadherin was directly adsorbed to rGO microfibers without EDC/NHS
chemistry by means of the preadsorbed IgG antibody (ADS). The homogeneity
of the microfiber coating was confirmed by immunofluorescence (using
either PLL-FITC or a primary antibody α-N-cadherin followed
by a secondary antibody Alexa 633). Control glass substrates were
functionalized following the same protocol as that used for rGO microfibers.

3.4 Cell Isolation and Culture
ENPCs were obtained
from
cerebral cortices of E18 Wistar rat embryos as previously described.52 All of the experimental protocols for cell collection
adhered to the regulations of the European Commission (directives
2010/63/EU and 86/609/EEC) and the Spanish government (RD53/2013 and
ECC/566/2015) for the protection of animals used for scientific purposes.
Adult female Wistar rats were provided by a commercial supplier (Harlan
Ibérica, Spain) and were sacrificed when gestation reached
18 days. A total of five independent cell cultures from five different
animals with a minimum of three replicates per condition in each culture
were carried out (≥ 45 microfibers per condition). The viability
of the so-isolated cells was 90 ± 4% in all cases. To guarantee
microfiber colonization, a total of 2.5 × 104 cells
contained in a small fraction of media (typically 10 μL) were
seeded on the top part of each one and allowed to attach for 10 min.
Immediately after, samples were completely covered with 500 μL
of complete Neurobasal media containing B-27 supplement (2%), streptomycin
(100 UI mL–1), penicillin (100 UI mL–1), and l-glutamine (1 mM). After 2 h of adhesion in a sterile
incubator at 37 °C in a CO2 atmosphere (5%), culture
media were replaced and cultures maintained were for up to 21 days.
Culture media were half-replaced every 4 days and fully replaced every
7 days. The cell culture was monitored in the periphery of the microfibers
using an Axiovert CFL-40 optical microscope with a coupled Axiocam
ICC-1 digital camera (Zeiss).

Meningeal fibroblasts were isolated
from the cerebral meninges of the rat E18 embryos used for the isolation
of ENPCs (n = 3). Cells were expanded in vitro to
achieve confluent cultures (typically ca. 14 days) in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum, streptomycin (100 UI mL–1), penicillin
(100 UI mL–1), and l-glutamine (1 mM).
Culture conditions on rGO microfibers were similar to those described
for ENPCs, with a cell density of 104 cells per microfiber.
The high cell seeding density used with both cell types intended to
aid microfiber colonization in a shorter period of time, overcoming
their cylindrical shape.

3.5 Surgical Procedure and
Tissue Processing
Adult male
Wistar rats were used at the age of ca. 21 weeks (n = 3, ca. 400 g in weight). The lesion model of choice was a right
lateral hemisection of approximately 8 mm3 (incomplete
lesion) at C6, rostral to the bulk of triceps brachii motoneurons. All experimental procedures in animals were approved
by the Animal Research and well-being committee of the Hospital
Nacional de Parapléjicos and carried out in accordance
with the national and European regulations as indicated above. Specific
details on the surgical procedure carried out can be found elsewhere.6,14 To facilitate their stable implantation in the injured spinal cord,
rGO microfibers were assembled into a 3D gelatin hydrogel scaffold
(7.5 wt % in distilled water) with the dimensions of the lesion site
(∼8 mm3; ∼20 microfibers per hydrogel). Prior
to implantation at the injured rat spinal cord, these hybrid scaffolds
were cross-linked by exposure to paraformaldehyde vapors at 4 °C
for 7 days. After implantation, an exhaustive postoperatory animal
care protocol was applied with major attention placed into signs of
pain, distress, dehydration, intestinal obstruction, and respiratory
failure. After 10 days post-injury, rats were sacrificed using a standard
perfusion-fixation protocol, and the spinal cords were extracted.
Perfused spinal cords were placed in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C
overnight and then 3 days in sucrose (30% in PBS) at 4 °C for
cryoprotection. C5–C7 spinal cord fragments were mounted on
plastic containers, quick-frozen in Optimal Cutting Temperature compound
(Tissue Tek, Hatfield, PA), and cut in sagittal sections of 10 μm
from right to left sides using a Microm HM550 cryostat with an angle
of 10°.

3.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) Studies
rGO microfibers
were rinsed in PBS twice and fixed with glutaraldehyde (2.5% in PBS)
for 45 min, which is a conventional fixation method for examination
by SEM (n = 3 for each type of bare microfibers,
and n ≥ 3 for each type of cell-cultured ones).
After washing in distilled water, dehydration was performed using
a series of ethanol solutions for 15 min (two washes) and a final
dehydration in absolute ethanol for 30 min. Samples were then dried
at room temperature for at least 24 h. After mounting in stubs and
gold coating under vacuum, the morphology of the samples was characterized
using a Hitachi S-4700 SEM microscope.

3.7 Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Studies
ENPC
cultures on the rGO microfibers were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%
in PBS) at room temperature for 12 min and then incubated with the
following primary antibodies: (1) map-2 for somas and dendrites in
neurons, (2) tau for axons in neurons, (3) vimentin for non-neuron
cells, including glial cells and connective tissue cells as fibroblasts,
(4) GFAP for astrocytes, and (5) synaptophysin for synapses. The secondary
antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 goat α-mouse IgG (H + L)
and Alexa Fluor 594 goat α-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Life technologies).
Both primary and secondary antibodies were dissolved in PBS containing
saponin (0.25%) and fetal goat serum (2%) to guarantee cell permeability
and to block any nonspecific bindings, respectively. Each antibody
was incubated for 1 h at room temperature in darkness. Cell nuclei
were labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 3 μM,
5 min).

Spinal cord tissue samples were examined for the presence
of the following markers: (1) map-2 for somas and dendrites in neurons,
(2) tau for axons in neurons, (3) vimentin for non-neuron cells including
glial and connective tissue cells, (4) GFAP for astrocytes, (5) ED1
for macrophages, and (6) platelet-derived growth factor receptor β
(PDGFRβ for pericytes, precursors of oligodendrocytes, and connective
tissue cells such as fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells). Secondary
antibodies were similar to those described above. Cell nuclei were
labeled with Hoechst (1 mg mL–1).

After immunostaining,
samples were visualized using a Leica TCS
SP5 microscope. The fluorescence of the different fluorochromes was
excited and measured as follows: Alexa Fluor 488 excitation at 488
nm with an argon laser and detection in the range 507–576 nm,
Alexa Fluor 594 excitation at 594 nm with a helium–neon laser
and detection in the range 625–689 nm, and DAPI/Hoechst excitation
at 405 nm with a diode UV laser and detection in the range 423–476
nm. Capture conditions in each case were established using appropriate
positive and negative controls and maintained during the acquisition
of all of the images. For each marker, an average of 3 nonoverlapped
images was captured per microfiber and coverslip (in vitro studies,
0.3 mm2 per field, n ≥ 15 images
in total) and five independent fields per animal and region (in vivo
studies, 0.2 mm2 per field, n ≥
10 images in total). The procedure used for the quantification of
the immunofluorescence images was based on an automatized protocol
created using Fiji software in which the observer
must only define a threshold of positive staining for each marker
established from the negative controls. To minimize bias effects,
quantifications were carried out blind by two independent observers.
The area positively stained for each particular marker was expressed
as a percentage of the total image area. Additional bright field images
were taken to properly define the location of the microfibers in all
cases. Panoramic views of cultures and tissue sections were obtained
by building mosaics from adjacent micrographs of the entire sample
surfaces.

3.8 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) Studies
Following
a conventional procedure, in vitro culture samples were first fixed
with a mixture of paraformaldehyde (4%) and glutaraldehyde (1%) in
phosphate buffer for 1 h and then postfixed in osmic tetroxide (1%
in distilled water) for an additional hour. Dehydration was then carried
out by immersion in successive solutions of ethanol at increasing
concentrations (30, 50, 70, 95, and 100%), with a final step in pure
acetone. Samples were included in the resin Durcupán by consecutive
immersion steps at increasing concentrations (1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 in
acetone). The final samples in pure resin were then polymerized at
60 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections (ca. 60 nm) were obtained
and subsequently stained with uracil acetate and lead citrate. The
visualization was carried out using a Jeol JEM 1010 microscope (Tokyo,
Japan) at 80 kV with a coupled camera (Gatan SC200, Pleasanton, CA)
for image acquisition (n = 5 microfibers, n ≥ 30 images).

3.9 Statistics
Quantified parameters were expressed as
the mean ± standard deviation (in all cases, n ≥ 3). When necessary, statistical analyses were performed
using Statistical Package for Social Sciences software (SPSS, version
17.0). Comparisons between groups were carried out using Student’s t-test. When more than two experimental groups were compared,
analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by either Scheffé or
Games-Howell post hoc tests (homogeneous and heterogeneous variances,
respectively) was used. The statistical significance levels were defined
as follows: p < 0.05*, p <
0.01**, and p < 0.005***.
