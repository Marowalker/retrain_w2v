A potent dopamine
(D2) receptor agonist (±)-quinagolide,
which is used for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia, was synthesized
using the ring closing metathesis (RCM) approach from meta-hydroxybenzaldehyde as the starting material. The key features of
this synthesis are pyrolytic elimination, late-stage expedient synthesis
of functionalized trans-fused tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylates from
olefin 6, via conjugate addition–elimination upon
acetate 11, followed by RCM and phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate)
(PIFA)-mediated Hofmann rearrangement of piperidine-3-carboxamide,
which enables the synthesis of 3-aminopiperidine skeleton of quinagolide.
For the total synthesis of natural products such as ergot alkaloids,
late-stage synthesis of functionalized trans-fused tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylates
using RCM and PIFA-mediated Hofmann rearrangement of piperidine-3-carboxamide,
which allows quick access to the synthetically challenging 3-aminopiperidine
skeleton, are the main achievements of the present work.

Introduction
Prolactinoma is a benign
tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland,
which produces hormone prolactin, and a condition that arises because
of elevated prolactin levels in blood is defined as hyperprolactinemia.
Pharmacological causes such as use of certain medications for the
treatment of various diseases and physiological causes such as pregnancy
and stress are the main factors behind the elevated level of prolactin.
Hyperprolactinemia may also be the result of disease of other organs
such as the liver, kidneys, ovaries, and thyroid. The most common
symptoms of hyperprolactinemia are hypogonadism, infertility, and
erectile dysfunction in men and galactorrhea and disruptions in the
normal menstrual period in women. Although hyperprolactinemia is not
considered as a life-threatening disease, it causes severe effects
on the life of patients and often leads to multiple life-threatening
diseases.1 For the treatment of hyperprolactinemia,
drugs such as bromocriptine (1), cabergoline (2), and quinagolide (3) are used as medications (see Figure 1).2

Figure 1 Available hyperprolactinemia medications bromocriptine (1), cabergoline (2), and quinagolide (3).

Out of these medications available
in the market, bromocriptine
(1) and cabergoline (2) have serious side
effects, whereas quinagolide (3) which is newly introduced
by Ferring Pharmaceuticals under the trade name NORPROLAC is considered
as a first-line therapy in the treatment of hyperprolactinemia.1b

The potent dopamine (D2) receptor
agonist quinagolide
is developed by combining structural features of both ergot and apomorphine
alkaloids.3 Quinagolide was first synthesized
in racemic form, and subsequently, its biological activity was reported
by Nordmann et al.3 Later in the year 2000,
scalable synthesis of quinagolide intermediate was reported by Bänziger
et al.4 Though the dopaminomimetic activity
is completely associated with the (−) enantiomer of quinagolide,3b in the present days, it is sold in its racemic
form as hydrochloride salt.

With the aim of developing a practical
route to this potent dopamine
agonist, synthetic studies toward quinagolide were initiated in our
group. Toward this, recently (2018), we reported an efficient synthesis
of quinagolide, which features a Claisen rearrangement, PPTS-catalyzed
one-pot acetal deprotection and intramolecular diastereoselective
Henry reaction, and ceric ammonium nitrate-mediated regioselective
azidoalkoxylation of enol ether as the key steps.5 In that context, our group effectively utilized ring closing
metathesis (RCM) as an important synthetic tool in the total synthesis
of natural products.6 Herein, we report
our alternative synthetic approach for the total synthesis of quinagolide
using RCM as the key reaction for the construction of 3-aminopiperidine
skeleton of quinagolide.

Over the last 3 decades, RCM is found
to be an important tool for
the synthesis of numerous piperidine and pyrrolidine alkaloids.7 The synthesis of alkaloids using RCM generally
requires either N-protecting groups (especially electron withdrawing)
or Lewis acid, so that lone pair of basic amine does not adversely
interfere in the reaction through chelating with the catalyst. Furthermore,
synthesis of functionalized 3-substituted tetrahydropyridine scaffolds
which are an integral part of many biologically active natural products
such as ergot alkaloids using RCM is considered as a challenging task.8,9

To the best of our knowledge, in literature, there are only
a few
reports in which late-stage synthesis of functionalized tetracyclic
3-substituted tetrahydropyridine scaffolds using RCM is documented
(Figure 2).10,11

Figure 2 Late-stage
synthesis of functionalized tri or tetracyclic 3-substituted
tetrahydropyridines using RCM approach.

After the seminal work by Martin and co-workers for the synthesis
of functionalized tetracyclic tetrahydropyridine scaffolds using RCM,12 the late-stage synthesis of tetracyclic 3-substituted
tetrahydropyridine for the total synthesis of (+)-isolysergol was
reported by the same group in the year 2010 (eq 1 in Figure 2).10 Also, recently (2017), Jia and co-workers reported late-stage synthesis
of tetracyclic 3-substituted tetrahydropyridine for the total synthesis
of (−)-agroclavine and (−)-elymoclavine using RCM (eq
2 in Figure 2).11 Here, in the case of first synthesis, preparation
of functionalized tetrahydropyridine scaffolds using RCM of a basic
amine containing electron-rich olefins was done using Schrock’s
catalyst, whereas in the later synthesis, Zhan 1-B catalyst was used
for the construction of functionalized tetrahydropyridine scaffolds
using RCM of an electron-deficient amine containing electron-rich
olefins. Reportedly, in both of these elegant syntheses, Grubbs I,
II and Grubbs–Hoveyda catalysts did not work. In that context,
late-stage synthesis of tricyclic trans-fused tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylates
using RCM could be more challenging, as the basic amine and the electron-deficient
olefin are the main deciding factors.7 Here,
we thought that construction of tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate using
RCM can fulfill the requirements for the rapid assembly of 3-aminopiperidine
core of quinagolide.

Accordingly, retrosynthetic plan for (±)-quinagolide
is shown
in Scheme 1. It was
thought that quinagolide could be accessed from an inexpensive and
commercially available starting material meta-hydroxybenzaldehyde.

Scheme 1 Key Retrosynthetic Disconnections for Quinagolide
As per the retrosynthetic plan, quinagolide 3 could
be obtained from tricyclic tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate 5 using phenyliodine bis(trifluoroacetate) (PIFA)-mediated
Hofmann rearrangement on the corresponding carboxamide 4 followed by sulfonation and demethylation. Tricyclic trans-fused
tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate 5 could be obtained
from olefin 6 upon conjugate addition–elimination
with required acetate followed by RCM. Olefin 6 could
be obtained from ester 7 by reduction to alcohol, corresponding
sulfoxide synthesis and pyrolytic elimination as key steps. Ester 7 in turn could be accessed from meta-hydroxybenzaldehyde
using PPTS-catalyzed one-pot acetal deprotection followed by diastereoselective
Henry reaction as a key step, which was reported earlier by our group.5

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
commenced with the goal of conversion of ester functionality
in compound 7 into corresponding olefin 6 through pyrolytic elimination (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Olefin 6 from Ester 7 by Pyrolytic
Elimination
To this end, ester 7 was reduced to the corresponding
alcohol 8 using NaBH4–LiCl in tetrahydrofuran
(THF)–EtOH (1:1) under reflux condition in 68% yield. Alcohol 8 was then converted into sulfide 9 by the combined
action of diphenyl disulfide and tributyl phosphine in 95% yield.13 Oxidation of the sulfide 9 to the
corresponding sulfoxide 10 was performed using NaIO4 in 95% yield.14 Pyrolytic elimination
of sulfoxide 10 under refluxing xylene condition afforded
olefin 6 in 98% yield.15 Here,
pyrolytic elimination was found to be a clean and high yielding reaction,
and it is a good alternative reaction sequence for the construction
of a vinyl group over other reduction–elimination sequence
in terms of overall yield and cost effectiveness of the process.

After successful synthesis of olefin 6, the next task
was the synthesis of diene for RCM (Scheme 3). At this stage, few conditions for the
N-alkylation using methyl 2-(bromomethyl)acrylate and acetate 11 were attempted, but all of them failed to provide the desired
product. In most of the cases, the starting material was recovered.
Therefore, it was decided to remove the N-Boc protecting
group and then attempt alkylation. Accordingly, olefin 6 was treated with TFA (10 equiv) in CH2Cl2 for
5 h and the corresponding amine was treated with acetate 11 in CH2Cl2 at room temperature by applying
the protocol described by Ramachandran et al.16 To our delight, our crude amine upon conjugate addition–elimination
with acetate 11 smoothly provided the desired N-alkylated
product 12 in 80% yield over two steps. Here, it was
observed that the concentration of the reaction mixture affects the
rate of the reaction and 0.05 M concentration gives the optimum yield.
In the next step, N-propylation was carried out using propyl iodide
and K2CO3 in acetonitrile under reflux condition
for 15 h to afford the corresponding diene 13 in 70%
yield.

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Tricyclic Core of Quinagolide Using RCM
With the diene 13 in hand, we were in comfortable
position to evaluate the crucial RCM reaction for the synthesis of
trans-fused tricyclic skeleton. Though it is reported in the literature
that, for the synthesis of tetracyclic skeleton using RCM, Grubbs
catalysts did not work,10,11 to our delight, the
RCM reaction of diene 13 using Grubbs’ II generation
catalyst and p-toluenesulfonic acid (PTSA) (1.1 equiv) in toluene
at 80 °C for 14 h smoothly provided the required tricyclic core 5 of the quinagolide in 93% yield. It is worth mentioning
that the solvent has great influence on the rate of reaction. When
the reaction was carried out in CH2Cl2 as the
solvent under reflux condition for 24 h, less than 30% conversion
was observed along with the recovery of the starting material, while
toluene turned out to be the best solvent for metathesis. Also, it
was observed that the reaction was completely homogeneous in toluene
at 80 °C and precipitation of ammonium salt was not observed
when formed.

After the crucial intermediate in hand, the next
aim was the synthesis
of amino side chain of quinagolide. To this end, reduction of the
double bond of 5 was performed using Pd/C under hydrogenation
condition to afford the compound 14 in 87% yield. The
stereochemistry of newly generated center was confirmed by comparison
of the spectrum of compound 14 prepared by a different
route.4,17 Furthermore, epimerization at ester center
of 14 was performed using a known protocol to afford
piperidine-3-carboxylate 15 in 85% yield.4 Compound 15 showed identical 1H
and 13C NMR spectra, which were consistent with the data
reported by Bänziger et al.4

Toward the completion of the total synthesis of quinagolide, the
next aim was the construction of the side chain. To this end, ester 15 was converted into the corresponding carboxamide 4 using NH3/MeOH and CaCl2 in 90% yield
(Scheme 4).18 Carboxamide 4 was subjected for
PIFA-mediated Hofmann rearrangement to obtain the corresponding amine 16 in 82% yield.19 Amine 16 was then sulfonated using diethylsulfamoyl chloride to
obtain the compound 17 in 71% yield. In the last step,
demethylation was performed using AlCl3–EtSH in
66% yield to complete the total synthesis of quinagolide 3.20 All the spectral data of quinagolide 3 were in complete agreement with the reported data.3a,5

Scheme 4 Completion of the Total Synthesis
Conclusions
To conclude, total synthesis of (±)-quinagolide
was performed
using the RCM approach. Pyrolytic elimination, late-stage synthesis
of functionalized trans-fused tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylate from
olefin 6 upon conjugate addition–elimination with
acetate 11 followed by RCM and PIFA-mediated Hofmann
rearrangement of piperidine-3-carboxamide, which enables the synthesis
of 3-aminopiperidine skeleton of quinagolide, are key features of
this synthesis. The present synthetic route allows late-stage synthesis
of trans-fused tetrahydropyridine-3-carboxylates using RCM reaction,
which could serve as an important example in the context of the total
synthesis of natural products having this structural motif such as
ergot alkaloids, and PIFA-mediated Hofmann rearrangement of piperidine-3-carboxamide
allowing quick access to the 3-aminopiperidine skeleton, which poses
a challenge to synthetic chemists, are the main achievements of the
present work. Our efforts are currently directed toward the enantioselective
total synthesis of quinagolide and will be reported in due course.

Experimental
Procedures
General
All reactions were carried out in oven-dried
glassware under a positive pressure of argon or nitrogen unless otherwise
mentioned with magnetic stirring. Air-sensitive reagents and solutions
were transferred via syringe or cannula and introduced to the apparatus
via rubber septa. All reagents, starting materials, and solvents were
obtained from commercial suppliers and used as such without further
purification. Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography
with 0.25 mm precoated silica gel plates (60 F254). Visualization
was accomplished with either UV light, iodine adsorbed on silica gel,
or by immersion in ethanolic solution of phosphomolybdic acid, p-anisaldehyde, 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine, KMnO4, or ninhydrin solution followed by heating with a heat gun for ∼15
s. Melting points are uncorrected. The 1H NMR spectra were
recorded on Bruker AV 200, 400, and 500 MHz NMR spectrometers using
the solvent residue signal as an internal standard [1H
NMR: CDCl3 (7.27), DMSO-d6 (2.50); 13C NMR: CDCl3 (77.00), DMSO-d6 (39.51)]. The 13C NMR spectra were recorded on
200 NMR (50 MHz), 400 NMR (100 MHz), and 500 NMR (125 MHz) spectrometers.
High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) [electrospray ionization
(ESI)] spectra were recorded on an Orbitrap (quadrupole plus ion trap)
and time-of-flight mass analyzer. The IR spectra were recorded on
a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Column chromatographic
separations were carried out on silica gel (60–120 mesh and
230–400 mesh).
