The use of copper
complexes for redox and oxidative-based mechanisms
in therapeutic strategies is an important field of multidisciplinary
research. Here, a novel Cu(II) complex [Cu(TPMA)(Phen)](ClO4)2 (Cu-TPMA-Phen, where TPMA = tris-(2-pyridylmethyl)amine
and Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) was studied using both the free and
encapsulated forms. A hollow pH-sensitive drug-delivery system was
synthesized, characterized, and used to encapsulate and release the
copper complex, thus allowing for the comparison with the free drug.
The human neuroblastoma-derived cell line NB100 was treated with
5 μM Cu-PMA-Phen for 24 h, pointing to the consequences on mono-
and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and PUFA) present in the membrane
lipidome, coupled with cell viability and death pathways (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium viability assay, flow cytometry, microscopy,
caspase activation). In parallel, the Cu-TPMA-Phen reactivity with
the fatty acid moieties of phospholipids was studied using the liposome
model to work in a biomimetic environment. The main results concerned:
(i) the membrane lipidome in treated cells, involving remodeling with
a specific increase of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and a decrease
of MUFA, but not PUFA; (ii) cytotoxic events and lipidome changes
did not occur for the encapsulated Cu-TPMA-Phen, showing the influence
of such nanocarriers on drug activity; and (iii) the liposome behavior
confirmed that MUFA and PUFA fatty acid moieties in membranes are
not affected by oxidative and isomerization reactions, proving the
different reactivities of thiyl radicals generated from amphiphilic
and hydrophilic thiols and Cu-TPMA-Phen. This study gives preliminary
but important elements of copper(II) complex reactivity in cellular
and biomimetic models, pointing mainly to the effects on membrane
reactivity and remodeling based on the balance between SFA and MUFA
in cell membranes that are subjects of strong interest for chemotherapeutic
activities as well as connected to nutritional strategies.

1 Introduction
Among
antitumoral active metallodrugs, copper(II) complexes are
particularly interesting due to the fact that they can undergo redox
activity upon in vivo reduction to Cu(I) and, together with DNA binding
properties, cause genome damage by mediating DNA strand cleavage.1−7 The increased requirement of copper in cancer cells for redox metabolism
and its catalytical properties to generate reactive oxygen species
(ROS) are the biological and chemical basis, respectively, for the
anticancer activity of these drugs, which act as artificial metallonucleases
(AMNs) for the sequence-specific disruption of gene function.1,8,9

One of the first discovered
antitumoral drugs of this kind was
bleomycin (BLM). Its capabilities to both chelate redox-active metal
centers (i.e. Fe(III) or Cu(II)) and subsequently bind to DNA endow
metallobleomycin with AMN activity, whereby strand cleavage is mediated
in the presence of O2 and a reductant by a metal-centered
BLM oxidant.10 This drug has been recently
investigated by some of us highlighting that: (i) the bleomycin–iron
complex can interact not only with DNA but also with the membrane
lipids due to the ligand lipophilic characteristics and (ii) the presence
of thiols, as biologically relevant reducing agent, leads to the generation
of thiyl radicals under aerobic conditions.11,12 These two events were found to induce a profound membrane remodeling
of fatty acids, with saturated fatty acid (SFA) content increased
at the expense of mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids (MUFA and
PUFA). Together with the process of lipid peroxidation induced by
ROS production, the cis–trans interconversion of the geometry
of unsaturated fatty acids in membranes occurred catalyzed by thiyl
radicals generated endogenously under condition of stress.13,14 The biomimetic model of liposomes, made of SFA-, MUFA-, and PUFA-containing
phospholipids, was also reported to model the behavior of lipid isomerization,
as well as the PUFA consumption, under biologically related free-radical
and oxidative conditions. The reactivity information helped for the
mechanistic interpretation of experiments carried out in cell cultures.11

Lipid metabolism is of crucial importance
for cancer cells due
to their active proliferation, and a large amount of lipids made of
SFA, MUFA, and PUFA for the synthesis of new membranes is needed.
The biosynthesis of SFA, such as palmitic acid (16:0) (produced by
fatty acid synthase) or stearic acid (18:0), and their subsequent
desaturation to MUFA (palmitoleic acid (Δ-9 16:1) and oleic
acid (Δ-9 18:1)) are now highlighted for their influence on
the biophysical nature of the tumor cell membrane and on cancer cell
signaling in proliferation and survival.15−19 With SFA, MUFA, and PUFA being present as dietary
intakes, the fatty acid balance can also influence drug effects and
interactions. Under these aspects, lipidomic studies provide important
information for new discoveries with practical consequences in cancer
treatments.20 In such aspects of fatty
acid metabolism, the influence of copper complexes is not known.

On the basis of these premises, the biomimetic and biological effects
of the synthetic chemical nuclease [Cu(TPMA)(Phen)](ClO4)2 (Cu-TPMA-Phen, where TPMA = tris-(2-pyridylmethyl)amine
and Phen = 1,10-phenanthroline) were examined (Figure 1). We have recently reported the synthesis
and potent DNA cleavage properties of Cu-TPMA-Phen,21 which was rationally designed to combine the catalytic
stabilizing effect of TPMA22−24 with the DNA oxidation properties
of copper(II) phenanthroline.24−27 As the Cu-TPMA-Phen molecule belongs to a series
of metal-containing reagents that induce chemical DNA scission, it
may well fall into the group of AMNs with cytotoxic properties against
human cancer cells.1,2,28,29

Figure 1 Molecular structure of Cu-TPMA-Phen.

The cell model used in our biological and cytotoxicity
evaluation
of Cu-TPMA-Phen was the human neuroblastoma-derived NB100 cell line.
Cell death pathway (apoptosis vs necrosis) triggered by Cu-TPMA-Phen
was investigated. In parallel to cytotoxicity experiments, membrane
fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography (GC), to obtain (i)
the membrane profiles related to the drug administration and (ii)
an insight into the fatty acid pathways that are influenced by the
drug.

As means of comparison with the in vitro effects, a biomimetic
model of liposomes treated with the copper complex was also used,
as previously described for bleomycin.11 The radical and oxidative processes were followed up using a variety
of reaction conditions, thereby providing a molecular basis to observe
these processes.

Finally, the use of this complex was carried
out in nanoscale drug-delivery
systems, capable of releasing drugs in both retarded and protected
ways. In recent research, drug encapsulation systems were successful
at releasing the therapy directly into cancer cells, providing a valuable
strategy to overcome the lack of selectivity in conventional chemotherapeutics.30,31 The properties of these systems are crucial for cancer targeting32−34 as much as the biological environment characteristics, which influence
the accumulation of the delivery system and the drug effects.35 The capability of responding to a number of
specific stimuli, related to particular tumor characteristics, such
as acidic pH, different temperature, or reductive environment, is
an important advancement in this field and can be utilized to achieve
a specific drug delivery.36,37 Indeed, one of the
major features of tumor tissues is the acidic extracellular pH that
is due to lactate secretion from anaerobic glycolysis. To date, many
polymeric pH-responsive delivery systems such as nanoparticles38,39 and micelles40,41 have been developed to take advantage
of the pH values related to pathological conditions. These systems
present physical properties such as swelling/deswelling, particle
disruption and aggregation, and protonation/deprotonation of the main
functional groups that change in response to different environmental
conditions. By choosing the most appropriate components for their
synthesis, properties can be fine-tuned to achieve the release of
the loaded drug only under the pH condition of interest.37 Here, a hollow pH-sensitive drug-delivery system
was synthesized, characterized, and used to encapsulate and release
Cu-TPMA-Phen. Cell experiments were carried out comparing free and
encapsulated Cu-TPMA-Phen formulations.

The interesting potentialities
of copper complexes are delineated
below by a multidisciplinary approach using chemical, biological,
and pharmacological knowledge and the know-how to extend the boundary
of this fast-growing research field.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Hollow P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA) Nanocontainers (NCs)
The
hollow pH-sensitive NCs were synthesized by a three-step process (Figure 2A). First, the poly(methacrylic
acid) (PMAA) cores were obtained with the distillation–precipitation
polymerization method. These cores were sacrificial templates synthesized
with no cross-linking agent, to be easily removed at the end of the
synthetic pathway.42,43 The second step was the synthesis
of the pH-sensitive shell with the distillation–precipitation
polymerization method, giving a core–shell structure.44,45 Finally, the cores were removed to obtain the hollow pH-sensitive
NCs. The NCs owe the pH sensitivity to methacrylic acid (MAA), used
as the main monomer for the synthesis of the shell: its polymer presents
carboxylic groups that can be protonated or deprotonated depending
on the pH of the medium (pKa ca. 4.5)
and thus differently interact with the surrounding environment.46 Other components were used in the synthetic
process for the stability of the final system. N,N′-Methylenebisacrylamide (MBA) was used as a cross-linking
agent, to maintain the structure of the hollow NCs in water; poly(ethylene
glycol)methyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA) was used as a hydrophilic,
nontoxic component, which is known to show resistance against nonspecific
protein adsorption and prolong in vivo circulation time of drug-delivery
systems.47

NCs: (i) distillation–precipitation

each synthesis step: (I) PMAA cores; (II) PMAA@P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA); and (III) hollow P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA) NCs.

SEM was used to investigate the size, shape, and the degree
of
polydispersity of the samples. Figure 2B depicts the nanoparticles as spherical and monodisperse.
In particular, the diameters of the cores and PMAA@P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA) were 190 ± 15 and 350 ±
15 nm, respectively, and the size of the hollow P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA) was approximately 350 ± 15 nm.
The successful coating of the PMAA cores was confirmed by the increase
in size between the NPs in I and II (from roughly 190 to 350 nm),
whereas the central cavity of the NCs in III proved the success of
the core removal procedure. We noted that the hollow NCs in Figure 2III appeared flattened;
therefore, the measurements of their diameter were taken as an approximation.
Finally, the synthesis of the pH-sensitive shell and the removal of
the cores were also confirmed with Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
(Figure S1 in the Supporting Information).

2.2 Loading and Release Behavior
The
loading process depends on the capability of the drug to interact
with the hollow NCs, specifically via electrostatic interactions and
hydrogen-bonding interactions involving the pendant functional groups
of the NCs and the solubilized drug.48,49 Cu-TPMA-Phen
is a water-insoluble molecule, and, to run the encapsulation experiments,
it was necessary to find the adequate aqueous conditions that could
both properly suspend the NCs and completely solubilize the drug.
Cu-TPMA-Phen was therefore solubilized in the smallest possible volume
of ACN before mixing it with the NCs suspension in buffer. To solubilize
2 mg of Cu-TPMA-Phen needed for the experiment, 50 μL of ACN
was used and this solution was then added to a previously prepared
suspension of 1 mg of NCs in 950 μL of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS). The final encapsulation conditions were: 2 mg of Cu-TPMA-Phen
and 1 mg of NCs in 1 mL of a mixture of PBS/ACN (19:1). The encapsulation
process resulted in encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and loading capacity
(LC%) to be, respectively, 36.4 ± 5.2 and 42.0 ± 3.3. This
corresponds to the encapsulation of 0.724 mg (0.988 μmol) of
Cu-TPMA-Phen/mg of NCs. The main interaction involved in the encapsulation
of Cu-TPMA-Phen is probably the electrostatic interaction between
the negatively charged carboxylate anions of PMAA and the 2+ positive
charge, which the complex assumes upon dissolution of the perchlorate
counterions. In addition, considering the electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) spectra and X-ray analysis previously reported,21 a distal pyridine nitrogen donor atom of TMPA was identified
within the coordination complex and may therefore interact with the
NCs through hydrogen bonding. In terms of loading, the large central
cavity of the NCs plays a fundamental role in accommodating the drug,48 which explains the overall impressive results
of the encapsulation process. The Cu-TPMA-Phen release profile from
the hollow NCs was studied in both acidic and slightly basic environments
to prove the pH-sensitive drug-delivery system. To release and detect
the Cu-TPMA-Phen with no interference owing to its solubility, two
mixtures of buffer and ACN were used. In particular, the release in
acidic pH was studied in a mixture of 0.1 M citrate buffer of pH 4
and ACN (19:1, v/v), whereas the slightly basic release medium was
a mixture of PBS and ACN (19:1, v/v). After 24 h, the amount of released
drug was, respectively, 50 and 32%, as shown in Figure 3. To investigate whether the amount of ACN
used for preparing the media affects the drug-release profile, the
same experiment was carried out by increasing the amount of ACN in
the mixtures up to 9:1. The drug-release profiles obtained in these
conditions were identical. The carboxylic groups of PMAA are the key
for the interpretation of these results. Indeed, they are mostly protonated
at pH 4 (pKa ∼ 4.5); therefore,
they cannot interact with the positively charged Cu-TPMA-Phen complex,
causing the release. In addition, it is known that at pH 4, the hydrogen-bonding
interactions are weaker than in neutral conditions,44 facilitating the release.

Figure 3 Cu-TPMA-Phen release profile of the pH-sensitive
NCs.

2.3 EPR Study
of Released Cu-TPMA-Phen
The EPR technique was used to investigate
the structure of the free
and released compounds and highlight possible modifications occurring
during the encapsulation/release processes.21 Once Cu-TPMA-Phen is released from the hollow NCs, it is necessary
to verify whether its starting conformation is kept, to exert the
biological activity. Figure 4A,C shows the spectra of free Cu-TPMA-Phen dissolved in the
release media in ACN/PBS (1:19) and ACN/0.1 M citrate buffer at pH
4 (1:19), respectively. In these conditions, Cu-TPMA-Phen shows a
clear trigonal bipyramidal conformation, with five atoms coordinating
the Cu(II) center. This structure is due to interactions between water
and the distal nitrogen atom outlined above. As such, when this nitrogen
donor does not coordinate the Cu(II) center, its lone pair is available
to form a hydrogen bond with a vicinal water molecule. In this condition,
the N is ligated outside the first coordination sphere, which results
in a five-coordination structure and a clear trigonal bipyramidal
spectrum.50−52Figure 4B,D shows the EPR spectra of released Cu-TPMA-Phen in ACN/PBS (1:19)
and ACN/0.1 M citrate buffer pH 4 (1:19), respectively. The spectra
are almost identical to the free complex, which is a strong indication
that the encapsulation and release processes do not affect the structure
of the complex.

of pH 4 (1:19); and (D) released Cu-TPMA-Phen in ACN/0.1 M citrate
buffer pH 4 (1:19).

2.4 Intracellular
Distribution of Cu-TPMA-Phen-Loaded
Nanocontainers
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM)
was used to investigate the drug release and the effect of the encapsulation
on the intra- and subcellular localization of Cu-TPMA-Phen by taking
advantage of its intrinsic fluorescence signal, which was successfully
applied in related studies involving daunorubicin.53 As shown in Figure 5, after 2 h treatment, both free Cu-TPMA-Phen and Cu-TPMA-Phen
released from the pH-sensitive NCs were localized mostly in the nuclei
of MCF7 cancer cells. Considering the intensities, the signal belonging
to the encapsulated Cu-TPMA-Phen is less intense than that belonging
to free drug. These observations suggest that the pH-sensitive NCs
do not affect the intracellular localization of the drug, and NC is
a drug delivery system that transports and delivers the drug without
affecting its activity.54 On the other
hand, the difference in intensity was expected: after 2 h in acidic
environment (such as endosomes–lysosomes, by virtue of which
the NCs are most likely internalized), the NCs release was roughly
35% of the encapsulated drug.

images of MCF7 cells
for 2 h treated with: (a–c) free Cu-TPMA-Phen (concentration
10 μM) and (d–f) Cu-TPMA-Phen-loaded NCs (drug concentration
10 μM).

2.5 Cytotoxicity
of Cu-TPMA-Phen, Free or Encapsulated
in pH-Sensitive Nanocontainers
Cell viability assays were
performed to assess the toxicity effect of Cu-TPMA-Phen, when the
latter is encapsulated in pH-sensitive nanocarriers. The encapsulation
of this complex in nanocontainers was carried out as described above.
The resulting viability curves were compared to those obtained after
treatment with free Cu-TPMA-Phen at the same concentration range,
0.1–30 μM, as shown in Figure 6. Incubation with 3, 10, and 30 μM
Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h results in significantly different viabilities
between cells treated with free and encapsulated complexes (p < 0.0001, 3 and 10 μM and p <
0.01, 30 μM) (Figure S4 in the Supporting
Information for the analogous experiments at 48 h). However, it should
be considered that these differences do not indicate a lower activity
of the NCs because the maximum release is at pH 4.0, which is a condition
easily obtainable in the lysosomal compartment of the tumoral cells,
but quite far from cell culture conditions.37,55 These differences in cytotoxicity can be attributed to the less
amount of bioavailable drug. In fact, as shown in Figure 3, only one-third of Cu-TPMA-Phen
is released from nanocontainers at the physiologic pH 7.4, which is
similar to cell culture conditions.

Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h. The results are presented as mean ± standard
deviation (SD) of three independent experiments performed in triplicate,
representing the percentage of control values obtained from cultures
grown in the absence of the complex. Statistical analysis was performed
with unpaired t test. ** p <
0.01, **** p < 0.0001.

2.6 Effects of Cu-TPMA-Phen on Cell Viability
Neuroblastoma cells (NB100) were exposed to different concentrations
of Cu-TPMA-Phen (0.1–30 μM) for 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell
toxicity of free Cu-TPMA-Phen was determined using an 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) cell viability assay.56,57 Dose-dependent curves were derived (Figure 7A), and the half-maximal effective concentration
(EC50) values were calculated. The EC50 was
4.2 μM (R2 = 0.97) after 24 h of
continuous incubation with the complex. Cell viability was also evaluated
in a pulse and chase experiment, in which NB100 cells were treated
for 2 h with various concentrations of Cu-TPMA-Phen (1–100
μM) and then washed and incubated with complete medium for 24,
48, and 72 h (Figure 7B). The concentrations effective to reduce cell viability of 50%
are reported in Figure 7C. It should be noted that 2 h of exposure to the complex can be
enough to ensure a strong cytotoxicity. In fact, the comparison of
EC50 calculated for continuous and pulse and chase experiments
shows only one log difference.

cells. (A) Cell viability
curves for NB100 cells continuously exposed to different doses of
Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24, 48, and 72 h. (B) Cell viability pulse and chase
curves of NB100 cells exposed at various doses of Cu-TPMA-Phen for

of untreated cells. The results in (A) and (B) are presented as mean
± SD of three independent experiments performed in triplicate.
(C) Half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) values
were calculated by nonlinear regression with standard slope analysis.
(D) The cell death pathway triggered by 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen was
evaluated on NB100 cells after 24 h of treatment by Annexin V/propidium
iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry analysis. Fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-A channel is used for the detection of Annexin V–enhanced
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fluorescence. Phycoerythrin (PE)-A
channel is used for the detection of PI fluorescence. Representative
plots of Annexin V/PI staining are shown; apoptotic (Q4, Annexin V+/PI−),
necrotic (Q1, Annexin V–/PI+), and late-stage apoptotic cells
(Q2, Annexin V+/PI+). (E) Caspase 3/7 activation in NB100 cells exposed
to 5 and 10 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h. The expression of activated
caspases is reported as a percentage of untreated cell values. Mean
± SD of three independent experiments, each in triplicate, are
given. Statistical significance was determined by unpaired t test (**** p < 0.0001). (F) Morphological
analysis of NB100 cells treated with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24
h, using phase contrast microscopy (400×).

To further study the cell death pathway, cytofluorimetric
analysis
of Annexin V/PI double staining of NB100 cells treated with Cu-TPMA-Phen
was carried out. This analysis indicated that NB100 cells treated
for 24 h with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen underwent apoptotic cell death.
Treated and untreated cells were stained with Annexin V–FITC
and PI to differentiate apoptosis versus necrosis. After treatment
with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h, 59% of the copper complex,
two-thirds of cell population, was in apoptosis and 5% of cells underwent
necrotic death (Figure 7D). The low amount of necrotic cells measured in our experiments
can represent an advantage for a possible therapeutic use of this
complex. In fact, necrosis, contrary to apoptosis, causes inflammation
that can be responsible for unwanted toxicity toward surrounding normal
tissue. In parallel, to confirm the apoptotic cell death pathway,
the caspase 3/7 activity was assessed in NB100 cells treated with
5 and 10 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h in comparison with untreated
(control) cells (Figure 7E). At both concentrations, caspases 3/7 were strongly activated
in Cu-TPMA-Phen-treated cells, reaching values higher than 300% that
of control cells. Finally, cell morphology was analyzed by phase contrast
microscopy on NB100 cells incubated with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for
24 h. Treated cells showed typical apoptotic morphological features
(Figure 7F).

2.7 Effects of Cu-TPMA-Phen on Membrane Lipidome
Using
the cytotoxicity parameters identified above, NB100 cells
were treated with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24 h (N = 6) and underwent fatty acid-based membrane lipidomic analyses.
Membrane fatty acids were isolated, derivatized, and analyzed by gas
chromatography (see Table S1 for details).
Membrane fatty acid-based lipidomics analysis on NB100 after 24 h
treatment revealed a significant increase of saturated fatty acids
(SFAs) (p < 0.0001) accompanied by a parallel
decrease of their monounsaturated (MUFA) counterparts (p < 0.0001) (Figure 8A). The family of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) did not show
significant alterations between treated and untreated cells. In particular,
the main members of SFA family, palmitic and stearic acids, are significantly
increased (Figure 8B), whereas the members of MUFA family, palmitoleic (9c-16:1), vaccenic (11c-18:1), and oleic (9c-18:1) acids, showed significantly decreased levels in
NB100 cells exposed to Cu-TPMA-Phen (Figure 8C). The enzymatic activity of stearoyl-coA
desaturase, which catalyzes the conversion of saturated fatty acids
to monounsaturated fatty acids, calculated by the product-to-precursor
fatty acid ratio, was estimated to be 2-fold decreased (p < 0.0001) (Figure 8D).58,59 Membrane lipidomics analysis was also performed
on NB100 cells treated with 5 μM of pH-sensitive nanocarriers
encapsulated Cu-TPMA-Phen. In this case, the impact on membrane lipidome
presents no significant difference between untreated and treated cells
(Figure 8A–D).
The membrane lipidomic experiments were carried out also in the breast
cancer-derived MCF7 cell line. The aim of this was to ascertain that
the above-described membrane remodeling is not specific for the neuroblastoma
cell line NB100, but can be extended to other cancer models. MCF7
cells were exposed to 10 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen, followed by membrane
fatty acid analysis. Interestingly, Cu-TPMA-Phen shows a similar effect
on cell membrane for both cell lines, although MCF7 and NB100 are
cells of different origins, carcinoma and neuroblastoma, respectively
(Figure S3 in the Supporting Information).

The results obtained from the
viability and apoptosis experiments
together with the results obtained from membrane fatty acid-based
lipidomics suggest an interesting behavior arising from oxidative
conditions typically associated with copper complex exposure.1,60 In fact, cell membranes exposed for 24 h to the free Cu-TPMA-Phen
do not show diminution of the PUFA residues of phospholipids, thus
suggesting that no interaction of these oxidizing molecules occurs.
Instead, the increase of SFA was associated with MUFA diminution,
which is not the most oxidizable lipid. Therefore, such decreases
may be attributed to a “metabolic” rather than a “chemical”
oxidative effect of Cu-TPMA-Phen. The increase of SFA can change membrane
properties toward less permeability and fluidity.61 The changes of membrane properties can trigger several
signals that lead to apoptosis, as demonstrated by supplementation
of palmitic acid to NB100 cells.43

The inhibition of desaturase is known to induce cancer cell death
and is indeed inspiring new pharmacological strategies in anticancer
therapy.62 In the case of Cu-TPMA-Phen
complex, more work is needed to understand the molecular basis of
such membrane remodeling, its possible involvement in desaturase inhibition,
and the association of this remodeling with the apoptotic fate here
observed.

In this work, we observed the absence of effects of
copper complex
when encapsulated in pH-sensitive nanocarriers, which do not release
sufficient drug doses for membrane remodeling, but suggest further
studies on the control of oxidative effects by drug delivery in the
sense of enhanced tumor targeting.63

2.8 Role of Cu-TPMA-Phen in the Geometrical Isomerization
of 1-Palmitoyl 2-oleoyl Phosphatidylcholine (POPC) in Large Unilamellar
Vesicles Obtained with the Extrusion Technique (LUVETs)
It
has been recently established that the well-known bleomycin–iron
complex does not generate oxidative damage only to target DNA, but
it also induces a profound membrane remodeling at the level of the
fatty acid constituents.11,12 The reaction of metal
complexes with thiols, which are active biomolecules, can lead to
the generation of thiyl radicals that either catalyze a cis–trans
isomerization of double bonds and/or initiate a lipid peroxidation.64 The biomimetic model of liposomes—made
of phospholipids—was designed and used to follow the fatty
acid fate.11 In this section, we applied
this biomimetic model to study the reaction of Cu-TPMA-Phen with thiols
in vesicle suspensions made of l-α-phosphatidylcholine
derivatives (Figure 9).

acid residues are attached, whereas in the sn-3 position, the polar
head group is connected. (B) A large unilamellar vesicle (LUV) and

(C) Reaction mechanism for the cis–trans isomerization catalyzed
by thiyl radicals. (D) Trans isomer (elaidate) formation in POPC vesicles
treated with 0.15 mM Cu-TPMA-Phen and different concentrations of
2-mercaptoethanol under aerobic or anaerobic conditions. (E) Trans
isomer (elaidate) formation in POPC vesicles treated with 10 mM concentration
of different thiols, 0.15 mM Cu-TPMA-Phen, and incubated at 37 °C
under aerobic conditions. In the case of 2-mercaptoethanol, after
120 min, another 10 mM thiol was added.

As far as the membrane biomimetic model is concerned, large
unilamellar
vesicles were obtained by the extrusion technique (LUVETs).65 The vesicles were suspended in an aqueous medium
containing Cu-TPMA-Phen and 2-mercaptoethanol or biothiol, like l-cysteine (CySH) and glutathione (GSH), applying anaerobic
or aerobic conditions. The fatty acid content of the vesicles was
SFA and MUFA in the form of oleic acid, when POPC was the phospholipid
used for vesicle formation. In the liposomes composed of soybean lecithin,
different percentages of SFA, MUFA, and PUFA fatty acid residues were
evaluated.66

By mixing Cu-TPMA-Phen
with 2-mercaptoethanol in aqueous solution,
the formation of an adduct is instantaneous, as evidenced by UV–vis
spectral features. In fact, the absorption band of Cu(II) complex
with a maximum at 626 nm decreased, and at the same time, a new absorbance
at 412 nm due to Cu(I) complex arose with the formation of the corresponding
disulfide (Figures 9B and S4 in the Supporting Information),
in analogy with the reaction of ascorbic acid. It is important to
underline that, in the LUVET suspensions made of POPC, when the thiol
solution was added at once to the solution in the presence of Cu-TPMA-Phen,
the trans isomer of the oleic moiety (i.e., 9-trans-18:1 as a result of the cis–trans isomerization) was observed
only in traces, even after prolonged incubation (4 h at 37 °C)
(Figure 9C). However,
adding the thiol dropwise (by a syringe pump, 0.5 mM/min), a substantial
increase of the trans isomer was detected.

Different ratios
of Cu-TPMA-Phen and 2-mercaptoethanol were then
used as reagents in LUVET suspensions. Figure 9D shows the outcome of the reaction between
0.15 mM Cu-TPMA-Phen and 2.5, 5, and 10 mM of thiol under aerobic
or anaerobic conditions, where as much as 19% of trans isomer formation
was reached. The yield from the initial fatty acid composition to
the final mixture was quantitatively determined by GC analysis. The
progressive increase in the amount of Cu-TPMA-Phen up to 1 mM showed
a parallel decrease in trans isomer formation (Figure S5 in the Supporting Information).

Next, we considered
the effect of biothiols, such as l-cysteine and glutathione,
in the same system. These two compounds
differ from 2-mercaptoethanol since they have a hydrophilic nature. Figure 9E shows the time
profiles of 2-mercaptoethanol, CySH, and GSH in LUVETs under identical
conditions. Comparison of the three different thiols suggests that
the isomerization rate follows the lipophilicity order of the three
compounds (i.e., 2-mercaptoethanol > GSH > CySH) and indicates
that
the CyS• radical is unable to migrate into the lipid
compartment.67,68Figure 9E also shows that further addition of 2-mercaptoethanol
after 2 h with the remaining Cu(II) produced more thiyl radicals and,
consequently, more of the trans isomers. After replacing POPC with
soybean lecithin (SFA 18%, MUFA 13%, and PUFA 69%) in the biomimetic
model described above, it was observed that (i) up to 120 min, the
trans isomers of MUFA and PUFA are below 0.6 and 4%, respectively,
independently from the presence or absence of oxygen and (ii) there
is a consumption of 4 and 6% of PUFA moieties in aerobic and anaerobic
conditions, respectively. These results concerning the oxidative and
cis–trans lipid isomerization processes, obtained in the biomimetic
model of POPC vesicles, are informative of the molecular reactivity
of the complex, thereby explaining at least, in part, the absence
of trans isomers.

3 Conclusions
An integrated
approach was used to examine the biological reactivity
of a novel artificial nuclease [Cu(TPMA)(Phen)](ClO4)2 using free and encapsulated drug forms within liposome and
cellular models. A nanoscale hollow pH-sensitive drug-delivery system
was successfully used to encapsulate and release, without changing
the copper complex structure as identified by EPR experiments. Membrane
fatty acid reactivity and the fatty acid remodeling were observed
in these models, respectively, analyzing SFA, MUFA, and PUFA moieties.
The lipidome analysis of NB100 cells indicated the involvement of
SFA and MUFA only in the free drug supplementation, whereas no changes
were observed when the drug release was controlled by the nanocontainer
delivery system. The parallelism between cellular and liposome models
was expedient to determine that MUFA and PUFA fatty acid moieties
are not affected by oxidative and isomerization reactions in the presence
of this copper(II) complex. More work is needed to understand the
molecular basis of the observed membrane remodeling, its possible
involvement in desaturase inhibition, and the association of this
remodeling with the cell death pathways. Our results can contribute
to the understanding of the behavior of metal complexes, in particular
indicating the interactions of metallome with membrane lipidomics.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Methacrylic
acid (MAA,
99%) was obtained from Acros Organics and used after purification
by distillation under vacuum. Poly(ethylene glycol)methyl ether methacrylate
(PEGMA; Mn = 475) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and used without further purification. 2,2′-Azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN, 98%) and N,N′-methylenebisacrylamide
(MBA, 96%) were purchased from Acros Organics and used as received.
Acetonitrile (ACN) was used as received from Sigma-Aldrich. Cu-TPMA-Phen
was prepared according to published procedure.21

Caspase activity was evaluated using the luminescent
kit Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay (Promega Corporation, Fitchburg, WI). Morphological
membrane changes were detected using Annexin V–EGFP/PI detection
kit (BioVision, Mt. View, CA). Viability was measured using the colorimetric
CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay (Promega).
The CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent contains the tetrazolium
compound 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS) and an electron-coupling reagent (1-methoxy
phenazine methosulfate). 1-Palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine
(POPC) and soybean lecithin were commercially available from Larodan
(Sweden). Other reagents used were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany),
Carlo Erba (Milano, Italy), and Sigma-Aldrich. Roswell Park Memorial
Institute (RPMI) 1640, fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine,
antibiotics, trypan blue, n-hexane, chloroform, and
methanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Flasks
and plates were from Falcon, BD Biosciences, NJ. Trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was from BioWhittaker Europe, Verviers, Belgium. CellTiter
96 Aqueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay and Caspase Luminescent
Assay were from Promega Corporation, Madison, WI. Viability was evaluated
by measuring absorbance at 492 nm by a microtiter plate reader Multiskan
EX (Thermo LabSystems, Basingstoke, U.K.). Phase contrast microscopy
was carried out with a Wilovert Standard PH 20 (HUND, Wetzlar, Germany)
and a digital camera from Motic Microscopes, China.

4.2 Synthesis and Characterization of Nanocontainers
The
synthesis of the PMAA cores was achieved via distillation–precipitation
polymerization. In particular, MAA (2.1 g; 24.4 mmol) was dissolved
in 200 mL of ACN and stirred at 75 °C for 30 min under nitrogen
atmosphere. AIBN (0.3 g; 1.8 mmol) was then added, and the flask content
turned into a milky suspension. Afterward, distillation was started
at a temperature of 95–100 °C. Once 20 mL of distilled
ACN was collected, the reaction was stopped. The final product was
obtained after three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension in
ACN (5 min × 8000 rpm). A second distillation–precipitation
polymerization process was used for the synthesis of the core–shell
system. The PMAA cores (0.15 g) were suspended in 200 mL of ACN and
stirred at 75 °C for 30 min under nitrogen atmosphere. MAA (0.53
g; 6.1 mmol) was added, and, after 10 min, PEGMA (0.16 g; 0.3 mmol;
5 mol % of MAA) and MBA (0.15 g; 0.97 mmol; 16 mol % of MAA) were
added as well. After 30 min, AIBN (0.09 g; 0.5 mmol; 8 mol % of MAA)
was then added. After 10 min, the temperature was raised to 95–100
°C to start the distillation. Once 30 mL of distilled ACN was
collected, the reaction was stopped. The final product was obtained
after three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension in ACN (5 min
× 5000 rpm). Regarding the core removal procedure, 250 mg of
PMAA@P(MAA-co-PEGMA-co-MBA) was
suspended in 200 mL of a mixture of 1:1 (v/v) EtOH/H2O
and stirred at room temperature overnight. The product was purified
by three cycles of centrifugation and resuspension (5 min × 5000
rpm). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) pictures were taken using
an FEI Inspect nanoscope with tungsten filament operating at 25 kV.
FT-IR spectra were recorded with a PerkinElmer Precisely Spectrum
100 spectrometer. The hydrodynamic diameter and the ζ potential
of the NCs in distilled water were measured with dynamic light scattering
(DLS) (Malvern Instruments Series, nano-ZS with multipurpose titrator).
The concentration of the sample was 0.1 mg/mL, and the given results
were the average value of 10 measurements, with 20 s integration time.
Sonication was performed with an ultrasonic bath (Elmasonic S 30H).

4.3 Drug Loading
Typically, 1 mg of NCs
was suspended in 950 μL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS).
Then, 2 mg of Cu-TPMA-Phen previously solubilized in 50 μL of
ACN was added. The final suspension, containing 1 mg of NCs and 2
mg of Cu-TPMA-Phen in 1 mL of mixture of 19:1 (v/v) PBS/ACN, was kept
under gentle magnetic stirring (ca. 300 rpm) for 24 h. At the end
of the process, the nonencapsulated portion of Cu-TPMA-Phen was removed
with five cycles of centrifugations and resuspensions in a fresh mixture
PBS/ACN (5 min × 11 000 rpm). The amount of encapsulated
Cu-TPMA-Phen was determined by UV spectroscopy (Helios Thermo Electron
Corporation) and calculated by the difference of Cu-TPMA-Phen concentration
between the original Cu-TPMA-Phen solution and the supernatants containing
the nonencapsulated drug. The calculations were based on a calibration
curve of Cu-TPMA-Phen obtained in the same solvent mixture (λmax 262 nm). Encapsulation efficiency (EE%) and loading capacity
(LC%) were the parameters used to evaluate the process (eqs 1 and 2) 1   2  

4.4 In Vitro
Release Study
The drug release
profile of Cu-TPMA-Phen-loaded NCs was studied with the dialysis bag
method (dialysis tube molecular weight cutoff 140 kDa). The release
experiments were carried out in acidic conditions (mixture of citrate
buffer pH 4.0, 0.1 M and ACN—19:1) and in slightly basic conditions
(mixture of PBS and ACN—19:1) to prove the pH sensitivity of
the system. Generally, 1 mg of loaded NCs was suspended in distilled
water, split into two dialysis bags, and incubated in 25 mL of each
release medium. At different time points (30 min, 1 h, 2 h, 5 h, 8
h, 10 h, and 24 h), 1 mL was collected from each solution and the
concentration of the samples was measured using UV–vis spectroscopy.
The calculations were made upon a calibration curve of Cu-TPMA-Phen
recorded in each buffer (λmax 262 nm).

4.5 EPR Study of Drug Released
Continuous-wave
(cw) EPR measurements at X-band were performed on a Bruker ESP 380E
spectrometer equipped with an EN 4118X-MD4 Bruker resonator. Experimental
conditions: microwave (mw) frequency, 9.715 GHz; mw power incident
to the cavity, 20 μW; modulation frequency, 100 kHz; modulation
amplitude, 0.1 mT; temperature, 70 K. Measurements at cryogenic temperatures
were performed using a helium cryostat from Oxford Inc. The microwave
frequency was measured using an HP 5350B microwave frequency counter,
and the temperature was stabilized using an Oxford ITC4 temperature
controller. The cw EPR spectra were recorded in frozen solutions at
70 K, and the samples were in a concentration range between 1 and
5 mM. Glycerol was added as a glassing agent, whose ratio with the
solutions was 1:4. The standard release procedure described above
was modified to obtain the required concentration (1–5 mM)
of the released complex in the media. In particular, 0.5 mg of loaded
NCs was suspended in distilled water, put into a dialysis bag, and
incubated in 0.3 mL of each release medium. After 24 h, the resulting
media were collected, glycerol was added, and the resulting samples
were then analyzed.

4.6 Confocal Laser Scanning
Microscopy
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) was
used to evaluate the
uptake of the pH-sensitive NCs and the subsequent release and localization
of Cu-TPMA-Phen. MCF7 cells were inoculated on 22 mm coverslips placed
into six-well culture plates (5 × 106 cells/well)
and grown for 24 h in 1.5 mL of complete growth medium. Free Cu-TPMA-Phen
(10 μM) or Cu-TPMA-Phen-loaded NCs (drug concentration 10 μM)
were then added. After 2 h incubation, the medium was removed and
the coverslips were washed twice with PBS, 1 mL of 4% paraformaldehyde
for 8 min in PBS, and PBS again, before placing them onto microscope
slides. The instrument used for the experiment was a Leica TCS SP8
MP, an inverted confocal microscope with Acousto-Optical Beam Splitter;
for the excitation and multiband spectral detector Argon—excitation
at 458, 476, 488, 496, and 514 nm DPSS 561—excitation at 561
nm (RED). Multiphoton IR laser Mai Tai DeepSee obtained from Spectral
Physics, with excitation at 780 nm, was used.

4.7 Cell
Cultures
The activity of Cu-TPMA-Phen
was assayed on NB100 cells that were derived from a human primary
neuroblastoma.56,57 Cells were cultured as a monolayer
at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2 in complete
medium (RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/mL penicillin, and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin).
Cultures were maintained in the log phase of growth with a viability
of >95% and checked for the absence of Mycoplasma infection. The
viability
was checked before each experiment by trypan blue (BioWhittaker, Verviers,
Belgium) dye exclusion. Before any treatment, cells were incubated
for 24 h. Flasks and plates were from Falcon (Franklin Lakes, NJ).
All of the other cell culture reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich. RPMI
1640 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Trypsin–EDTA, l-glutamine, penicillin–streptomycin solution, and heat-inactivated
fetal bovine serum (FBS) were obtained from Biochrom KG.

4.8 Cell Viability Assay
Cell viability
was evaluated using the colorimetric CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution
Cell Proliferation Assay. Cells (2 × 104/well) were
seeded in 96-well microtiter plates in 100 μL of complete medium.
After 24 h, the cells were incubated in the absence or presence of
Cu-TPMA-Phen at various concentrations in complete medium. After the
indicated times, 20 μL/well of kit solution was added. After
1–2 h of incubation at 37 °C, the absorbance at 492 nm
was measured by a microtiter plate reader Multiskan EX (Thermo LabSystems,
Helsinki, Finland). In continuous incubation experiments, the cells
were exposed to Cu-TPMA-Phen for 24, 48, and 72 h at concentration
ranging from 0.1 to 30 μM. In pulse and chase experiments, the
cells were treated with Cu-TPMA-Phen for 2 h at concentration ranging
from 0.1 to 100 μM and then incubated in complete medium for
total time of 24 and 48 h. Half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) was determined by standard slope analysis without normalization.

4.9 Evaluation of Apoptosis
The cell
death pathway (apoptotic vs necrotic) was assessed using a flow cytometry
Annexin V/PI detection kit and by a luminescent reagent detecting
caspase activity.56 For flow cytometry
experiments, cells (2 × 105/3 mL) were seeded in 25
cm2 flasks and, after 24 h incubation with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen,
the cellsPhen were treated with Annexin V–EGFP and PI and analyzed
by flow cytometry.56 The apoptotic (Annexin
V+/PI−), necrotic (Annexin V–/PI+), and late-stage apoptotic
cells (Annexin V+/PI+) were counted by the instrument and reported
on scatter plots. The caspase-3/7 activity was assessed by the luminescent
Caspase-Glo 3/7 Assay.56 Briefly, cells
(2 × 103/well) were seeded in 96-well microtiter plates
in 100 μL of complete medium. After 24 h, the cells were treated
with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen. After further 24 h incubation, 100 μL/well
of caspase kit reagent was added. After 20 min, the luminescence was
measured by a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo LabSystems), and the values
were normalized to cell viability. The morphological features of the
treated cells were analyzed through phase contrast microscopy, directly
in a 96-well plate, using an inverted microscope Nikon Eclipse TS100
(Nikon, Melville, NY).

4.10 Phospholipid Extraction
and Fatty Acid Analysis
To analyze the effect of Cu-TPMA-Phen
treatment on membrane fatty
acids, 0.8 × 106 cells were seeded in 25 cm2 flasks in 5 mL of complete medium. After 24 h of incubation, medium
supplemented with 5 μM Cu-TPMA-Phen was added. The cells were
harvested and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellet was resuspended
in 1 mL of Milli-Q H2O and centrifuged at 14 000
rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. Membrane pellet was dissolved in 2:1
chloroform/methanol, followed by the Folch extraction method. Lipid
extract was examined by thin-layer chromatography (n-hexane/diethyl ether/acetic acid 70/30/1) to determine the purity
of the phospholipid fraction. The phospholipid extract was then treated
with 0.5 M KOH/MeOH for 10 min at room temperature under stirring
for the derivatization of fatty acid residues of the phospholipids
into their corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs). After transesterification,
FAMEs were extracted with n-hexane; n-hexane phase was dehydrated with anhydrous Na2SO4, evaporated, and analyzed by gas chromatography (Agilent
6850, Milan) equipped with a 60 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm
(50% cyanopropyl)-methylpolysiloxane column (DB23, Agilent) and a
flame ionization detector, with an injector temperature of 230 °C
and a split injection of 50:1. Oven temperature started from 165 °C,
held for 3 min, followed by an increase of 1 °C/min up to 195
°C, held for 40 min, followed by a second increase of 10 °C/min
up to 240 °C, and held for 10 min. A constant pressure mode (29
psi) with helium as carrier gas was used. Methyl esters were identified
by comparison with the retention times of commercially available standards
or trans fatty acid references, obtained as described elsewhere. The
list of the examined FAME (corresponding to chromatographic peak areas
>97%) in membrane PL is reported in Table S1 as % relative percentages ± standard deviation (SD).

4.11 LUVET Preparation
Phosphatidylcholine
(PC) chloroform solution (53 mg dissolved in 3 mL) was evaporated
to a thin film in a test tube under a stream of argon and then kept
under high vacuum for 30 min at room temperature. To obtain a final
concentration of 70 mM phospholipid content, 1 mL of tridistilled
water was added. As a result, multilamellar vesicles were formed by
vortex stirring for 7 min under an argon atmosphere. Large unilamellar
vesicles (LUVs) with a mean diameter of 156–158 nm were prepared
by extrusion technique using LiposoFast and a 200 nm polycarbonate
membrane filter as described previously. The size of the liposomes
was measured using dynamic light scattering (DLS) methodology. The
LUVET stock suspensions were transferred into a vial and stored at
4 °C for a maximum of 2 weeks.

4.12 Isomerization
of PC in LUVET
The
total volume for every reaction was 1 mL of LUVET stock (phospholipid
concentration of 1 mM). More specifically, an aliquot of 14.5 μL
fatty acid content from the stock solution was added to tridistilled
water in the reaction vessel. To the liposome suspension, the copper
complex was transferred (0.15 mM) and the reaction remained under
stirring for 2 min. From stock solutions in tridistilled water and
final concentration in the reaction 10 mM, the thiol, 2-mercaptoethanol, l-cysteine (CySH), or reduced glutathione (GSH), was added to
the reaction dropwise (0.5 mM/min) using a syringe pump. Each reaction
vessel was incubated at 37 °C, and, to follow the formation of
trans fatty acid residues, the samples were analyzed at different
times. The workup of the vesicles was made with 2:1 chloroform/methanol,
extracting and collecting the organic phases dried over anhydrous
sodium sulfate and evaporating the solvent under vacuum at room temperature.
The phospholipids extracts were treated with 0.5 M KOH/MeOH, in a
transesterification type of reaction for 10 min at ambient temperature.
The reaction was quenched with the addition of tridistilled water,
followed by an extraction with n-hexane. The organic
layer containing the corresponding fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs)
was analyzed by GC for the determination of the cis–trans isomer
content. For the experiments under anaerobic conditions, all of the
solutions were degassed with argon for 15 min and the addition of
all reagents took place under a stream of argon. The anaerobic conditions
were maintained during the incubation period by creating pressure
of argon inside the reaction vial.

4.13 Statistical
Analysis
Fatty acid
values represent the mean ± SD. Statistical analysis was conducted
using GraphPad Prism 7.02 software for Windows, GraphPad Software,
La Jolla, CA. The data were analyzed with unpaired t test. Statistical significance was based on 95% confidence intervals
(p ≤ 0.05).
