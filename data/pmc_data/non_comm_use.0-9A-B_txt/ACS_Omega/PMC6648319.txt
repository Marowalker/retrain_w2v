Accurate
recognition and speciation analysis of heavy-metal ions
in complex hydrological environments is always a serious challenge.
In this work, we proposed a small-molecule-based ultrasensitive colorimetric
detection strategy and successfully applied it to the accurate detection
of Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ in groundwater through the specific recognition of multiple ligands
of different metal ions. The detection limits for Hg2+,
Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ are calculated
to be 6.51, 0.34, 0.49, and 1.01 ppb, respectively, which are far
below the drinking water standards and superior to most of the reported
colorimetric sensors. Remarkably, the speciation analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+ also has been successfully realized by a
one-step method without complex pretreatment. The speciation and concentration
of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in actual water samples can
be accurately identified and monitored. In addition, as an attempt
of visual onsite detection, we have developed a simple test strip,
which has been applied to visual monitoring of four metal ions with
the detection limit estimated by the naked eye to be as low as ppb
level. This proposed colorimetric method realizes the rapid, sensitive,
and portable multiple metal ions recognition and Fe2+/Fe3+ speciation analysis, displaying great potential for onsite
rapid water quality analysis.

1 Introduction
Large
amounts of toxic and carcinogenic heavy metal ions have been
released into the environment in recent years due to the accelerated
industrial and agricultural development.1−3 The cross-contamination
of heavy metals, which contains multiple or even different speciations
of toxic heavy metal ions, is also increasingly common in the hydrological
environments,4,5 posing a serious threat to ecological
environments and organisms.6,7 Therefore, accurate
identification and determination of heavy metal ions and their speciations
are crucial. However, the complex hydrological environment makes it
a big challenge to accurately detect and assess the contamination
of groundwater.8,9

The existing analysis techniques
such as atomic absorption, emission,
and mass spectroscopies are based on field sampling and laboratory
testing modes,10−12 which are complicated and time consuming, and impose
strict demands on the preservation and transportation of sensitive
water samples. Moreover, most of the detection techniques can only
realize the measurement of the total content of metal ions, whereas
speciation analysis requires verbose pretreatments such as oxidation,
reduction, or addition of additives.13−16 To develop a novel detection
technology for rapid, simple, and portable onsite multiple metal ions
recognition and polyvalent metal speciation analysis is urgently needed.
In this context, colorimetric methods have emerged as an alternative
to spectroscopy-based methods because of the convenient operation,
low cost, and quick responses.17−20 The colorimetric detection of metal ions can be clearly
observed by naked eyes or monitored using a portable UV–vis
spectrophotometer, without resorting to cumbersome instrumental analysis.21−23 In particular, the colorimetric probe of small molecules aroused
more interest because it contains multiple recognition sites and has
the potential to recognize multimetal ions simultaneously.

Herein,
we proposed a small-molecule-based ultrasensitive colorimetric
detection strategy and successfully realized the accurate detection
of Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ in groundwater through the specific recognition of multiple ligands
for different metal ions. The obtained chemosensors showed excellent
stability in 100% aqueous solution and displayed different absorption
spectral signals and significant color differences for four hard-to-distinguish
metal ions. The detection limits for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ are calculated to be 6.51,
0.34, 0.49, and 1.01 ppb, respectively, which are far below the standards
in drinking water recommended by World Health Organization (WHO)24−27 and superior to most of the reported colorimetric sensors. Remarkably,
the colorimetric sensors have been successfully applied to the speciation
analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+ through a one-step method
without complex pretreatment, which can accurately identify and monitor
the speciation and concentration of Fe2+ and Fe3+ in actual water samples. In addition, as an attempt of visual field
detection, we have developed a simple test strip, which has been successfully
applied to visual monitoring of four metal ions with the detection
limit estimated by the naked eye to be as low as ppb level. This proposed
colorimetric method realizes the rapid, sensitive, and portable multiple
metal ions recognition and Fe2+/Fe3+ speciation
analysis, displaying great potential for onsite rapid water quality
analysis.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis
of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ
Efficient
detection of multiple metal ions means that efficient ligands are
required. Terpyridine (Tpy) is considered as a good candidate because
it contains three strongly chelating N elements. In addition, terpyridine
possesses a typical conjugated system that has great potential to
cause fluorescence or absorption spectrum changes and even induce
significant color changes when coupling with metal ions, which is
of great significance for visual monitoring. However, the unsatisfactory
water solubility limits its further application. We herein introduce
hydrophilic groups quinolinium iodide (QL) and benzothiazolium iodide
(BZ) to terpyridine backbone to improve hydrophilicity. The synthesize
procedures of terpyridine derivatives Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ are outlined
in Scheme 1. All products
were purified by column chromatography and then characterized by NMR
and high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS), from which satisfactory
data were obtained corresponding to their molecular structures.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ
2.2 Colorimetric Detection of Multimetal Ions
As expected, the introduction of quinolinium iodide and benzothiazolium
iodide endow Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ with excellent hydrophilicity, which
means that they can be completely dissolved in 100% aqueous solution.
Subsequently, we carefully investigated the binding ability of Tpy-QL
and Tpy-BZ toward different metal ions by UV–vis spectra in
water solution. As shown in Figure 1, the free Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ in water displayed two
characteristic absorption bands at 282 and 354 nm and 280 and 360
nm, which were assignable to π → π* intramolecular
charge-transfer transitions. This absorption spectrum was almost unchanged
when 5 equiv of metal ions (Cd2+, Mn2+, Cr3+, Pb2+, Cu2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, Ag+) were added. However, remarkable
spectrum changes along with distinct color transformation could be
observed upon the addition of Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, or Fe3+. Moreover, the spectral changes caused
by these four metal ions were completely different, so were the color
changes.

Figure 1 Absorption spectra of (a) Tpy-QL and (b) Tpy-BZ (10 μM) in
100% water solution (phosphate buffer solution (PBS) buffer, 10 mM,
pH = 7.0) in the presence of different metal ions (3 equiv). Inset:
(up) color patterns of the solutions using (a) Tpy-QL and (b) Tpy-BZ
for different metal ions and (below) digitalized color pattern corresponding
to above.

Next, we focused on the changes
in absorption spectra of Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ after
binding to Tpy-BZ and Tpy-QL. As depicted in Figure 2a, the bands at 282 and 354 nm gradually
decreased and finally the band at 282 nm vanished with the addition
of Hg2+. Meanwhile, the decrease of band at 354 nm was
accompanied by a significant red shift from 354 to 409 nm. Accordingly,
an obvious color change from colorless to pale yellow was observed.
For the titration of Co2+, the band at 282 nm was almost
unchanged and the band at 354 nm was slightly enhanced, whereas a
new band at 520 nm formed and developed, which led to significant
color change from colorless to pink. Unlike Co2+, this
newly emerging absorption band was transferred to 607 nm when Fe2+ ions were added and sharply enhanced as the concentration
of Fe2+ increased. Furthermore, the color quickly turned
into blue. Interestingly, when Fe3+ was introduced into
Tpy-QL solution, the phenomenon was also different from that of Fe2+. As shown in Figure 2d, in the presence of Fe3+, the band at 607 nm
was slightly blue-shifted to 598 nm and the intensity was reduced
to half. Meanwhile, an inconspicuous band gradually appeared at 488
nm as the Fe3+ concentration increased. Undoubtedly, such
a phenomenon that one chemosensor exhibits completely different spectral
change and colors than multiple metal ions is extremely rare, which
can be used for colorimetric detection of multiple metal ions. Moreover,
similar results that exhibited completely different absorption bands
and color changes for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ could be observed when investigating Tpy-BZ
(Figure S1). We also carefully studied
the stability of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ after the addition of excess metal
ion. As shown in Figure S2, the absorption
intensities of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ were quite stable and almost no changes
were observed within 150 min. This result indicated that Tpy-QL and
Tpy-BZ had good stability in aqueous solution and met the detection
requirements.

in water
(PBS buffer, 10 mM, pH = 7.0) in the presence of various concentrations
of (a) Hg2+, (b) Co2+, (c) Fe2+,
and (d) Fe3+. The red line represents the spectrum of free
Tpy-QL in water and blue line represents the spectrum after reaction
saturation. The inset photographs were taken after the Tpy-QL and
metal ions were completely reacted.

To assess the sensitivity, different concentrations of Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were
added
to the Tpy-QL solution (10 μM). As shown in Figure S3, good linear relationships between the absorbance
intensity and the specified concentration range were obtained. The
corresponding detection limits (LOD = 3σ/s)
were also calculated to be 32.56 nM (Hg2+), 5.89 nM (Co2+), 8.75 nM (Fe2+), and 17.89 nM (Fe3+), which were much lower than the majority of the reported colorimetric
sensor (Tables S1–S4). The detection
performance of Tpy-BZ was also analyzed (Figure S4), and the detection limits calculated by the same method
were 27.69 nM (Hg2+), 4.81 nM (Co2+), 5.58 nM
(Fe2+), and 24.73 nM (Fe3+), which were basically
consistent with that for Tpy-QL. Such low detection limits and distinct
color changes promise their practical application for detecting Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ in
water.

The colorimetric sensors not only exhibited excellent
sensitivity
to Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ but also displayed good selectivity. Take Tpy-QL as an example,
as shown in Figure 3, it only showed distinct differential absorption signal for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ but
no change for other metal ions, showing good selectivity. The interference
tests were subsequently operated by adding corresponding ions to the
probe solution containing the interference cations. The results indicated
that signal recovery of Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, or Fe3+ was not affected by the coexisting metal ions
or anions.

ions (collected at 520 nm for Co2+, 280 nm for Hg2+, 607 nm for Fe2+, and 598 nm for Fe3+). (1)

The Job’s plot analysis
was executed to investigate the
reaction ratio between sensors and metal ions. The measured absorbance
intensity reached a maximum when the molar fraction of ([Mn+]/[[Mn+] + [Tpy-QL]])
was approximately 0.33, suggesting that Tpy-QL reacted with Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ in
2:1 stoichiometry (Figure S5). Further,
the binding affinity of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ was estimated from
the Benesi–Hildebrand28 plots. By
using the linear fitting of absorbance titration data with 1:2 binding
model (Figure S6), the association constants
(Ka) of Tpy-QL for four metal ions were
estimated to be 2.89 × 102 M–1/2 (Hg2+), 3.12 × 102 M–1/2 (Co2+), 3.31 × 102 M–1/2 (Fe2+), and 3.70 × 102 M–1/2 (Fe3+). Using the same method, the Ka of Tpy-BZ for four metal ions were estimated to be 2.71
× 102 M–1/2 (Hg2+), 3.03
× 102 M–1/2 (Co2+), 3.05
× 102 M–1/2 (Fe2+), and
3.26 × 102 M–1/2 (Fe3+). Obviously, there is no significant difference in the binding ability
of Tpy-BZ and Tpy-QL to four metal ions.

2.3 Speciation
Analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+
In view of the
critical role of different speciation
of iron ions in the redox process in environmental systems, accurate
detection of iron ions with different oxidation states and corresponding
concentrations is of great significance. However, methods for simultaneously
detecting Fe2+ and Fe3+ in samples are rarely
reported and only total concentration or specific oxidation state
for iron ions can be measured. Here, both Tpy-BZ and Tpy-QL exhibit
different absorption signals for Fe2+ and Fe3+, demonstrating the potential for simultaneous identification and
detection of Fe2+ and Fe3+. Figure 4a shows the absorption spectra
of Tpy-QL for different molar ratios of Fe2+/Fe3+. With the increase of Fe3+ molar ratio, the characteristic
absorption band of Fe3+ at 488 nm was gradually enhanced,
whereas the absorption band of Fe2+ at 607 nm was gradually
weakened and blue-shifted to 598 nm. By calculating the absorption
peak area at 488 nm (S488) and 598 nm
(S598) (Figure S7), we found that the peak area sum of S598 + S488 was a constant value at a specific
total iron concentration and was not affected by the ratio of Fe2+ (Figure 4b). Interestingly, S598 + S488 was proportional to the total iron concentration and
showed a good linear relationship in the concentration range of 0–8
μM (Figure 5a).
Moreover, the ratio of peak area (S598/S488) was closely related to the molar
ratio of Fe2+, with a correlation coefficient of 0.998
(Figure 5b). Therefore,
the total Fe concentration can be quantitatively analyzed using S598 + S488, and
the molar ratio of Fe2+ and Fe3+ can be ascertained
by S598/S488, thus realizing the speciation analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+.

2.4 Mechanism
Studies
We monitored the
reactions of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ with metal ions by 1H NMR
titration experiments in DMSO-d6. However,
we failed to obtain the 1H NMR spectra of Tpy-QL-Fe2+, Tpy-QL-Fe3+, and Tpy-QL-Co2+ due
to the strong interference of lone electron in Fe2+, Fe3+, and Co2+ compounds, and only the 1H NMR spectra of Tpy-QL-Hg2+ was available. As shown in Figure 6, all pyridine protons
on Tpy-CHO, Tpy-BZ, and Tpy-QL exhibited varying degrees of up-shift
after reaction with 5 equiv of Hg2+, whereas the aldehyde
proton or quinoline ring protons remained unchanged. This result indicated
the electron density on the pyridine rings was reduced after reaction,
implying all pyridine rings were involved in the reaction and the
electrons may flow to the metal moiety.

Figure 6 1H NMR spectra
of Tpy-CHO, Tpy-BZ, and Tpy-QL in DMSO-d6 before (a, c, e) and after (b, d, f) the
addition of 5 equiv of Hg2+.

To get a deep insight into the binding mode, the geometry
optimizations
and electronic calculations for several possible complex structures
of Tpy-QL and metal ions with a 2:1 stoichiometry were performed using
the B3LYP functional and Gaussian 09 package. The calculated optimized
structures indicated that the binding sites of Tpy-QL with metal ions
were the pyridine nitrogen. As depicted in Figure 7a, each Hg2+ ion chelated with
six pyridine nitrogen of two Tpy-QL molecules to form a stable six-coordinate
structure. The two Tpy-QL molecules were almost perpendicular to each
other, with an angle of 91.28°, the length of the Hg–N
bonds was 1.97 Å, and the angle of the coordinate bond was 81.55°.
Similar calculated results could be obtained from Tpy-QL-Fe2+, Tpy-QL-Fe3+, and Tpy-QL-Co2+ (Figure S8), and the structural parameters were
all within the reasonable range of stable structures (Table S5). These results implied the difference
in absorption spectra root in diverse chemical properties of the metal
ions, rather than the differences in the chelating mode.

calculated optimization Tpy-QL-Hg2+ structure. (b) Corresponding
electron density changes before and after the reaction of Tpy-QL with
Hg2+. The blue area indicates decrease in electron density
after the reaction, whereas the purple area indicates increase in
electron density.

The electron transformations
of Tpy-QL before and after reaction
with Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were investigated using Multiwfn package. As displayed in Figure 7b, the blue region
indicated a decrease in electron density after the reaction, meaning
that electrons were contributed. The purple area indicated an increase
in electron density, implying an inflow of electrons. Obviously, the
electrons on the pyridine ring, especially on the N atom, significantly
flowed to the metal center during the reaction, whereas the electron
density on the quinoline moiety was almost unchanged, being highly
consistent with the 1H NMR experimental phenomenon. In
addition, the two-dimensional electron density color-filled maps of
Tpy-QL-Hg2+ could provide more evidence that the electron
density of terpyridine moiety decreased significantly after binding
to mercury ions (Figure 8).

optimum partial structure.

2.5 Analytical Applications in Real Water Samples
Considering the excellent stability, selectivity, and sensitivity
of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ to Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+, their detection performances in the natural
water samples are expected. Herein, the analysis of natural water
samples and standard addition recovery experiments were carried out
to verify the practicability of the proposed method. As depicted in Table 1, the found values
of four metal ions were consistent with the spiked values and agreed
with the inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) results, demonstrating the validity of the sensors to the
natural water samples. Next, we carefully investigated the feasibility
of the sensors for the speciation analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+ by adding different molar ratios of Fe2+ and
Fe3+ (total concentration was 100 ppb) into different natural
water samples. As shown in Table 2, the found values were all consistent with the added
values in tap water, Yangtze River water, and Jianghan Plain groundwater
samples. The sum of Fe2+ and Fe3+ concentrations
measured by the proposed colorimetric method was in good agreement
with the ICP-AES results, and the standard deviation was within the
error tolerance. This result showed that the presented method had
the ability to simultaneously recognize Fe2+ and Fe3+ in Fe2+/Fe3+ mixtures, displaying
the potential for speciation analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+ in actual samples.

Onsite
visual monitoring is of great significance for water quality
analysis. Here, as an attempt, we developed a simple test strip for
visual detection of metal ions by immersing ordinary filter paper
into the water mixtures of poly(vinyl alcohol) and Tpy-QL. As shown
in Figure 9, the test
strips displayed different colors for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+, and the color deepened as
the concentration increases. It should be noted that this test strip
is very stable and can be stable for at least 2 weeks. The detection
limits observed by the naked eye were estimated to be 10, 25, 10,
and 200 ppb for Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+,
and Hg2+, respectively, which were attractive for onsite
visual inspection. However, we should be soberly aware that this strip
still has a long way to go before it can be accurately applied to
complex actual samples.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully developed two small-molecule-based
ultrasensitive colorimetric method for Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ detection in groundwater.
Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ had the ability to specifically chelate with Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ with
a stoichiometric ratio of 2:1, exhibiting different absorption responses
and color changes. The detection limits for Hg2+, Co2+, Fe2+, and Fe3+ were calculated to
be 6.51, 0.34, 0.49, and 1.01 ppb, respectively, which were superior
to that of most of the reported chemosensors. Moreover, the sensors
have been successfully applied to speciation analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+. The recovery test of the actual water sample indicated
that the measurement results by sensors were well consistent with
the added values and matched with the ICP-AES results, demonstrating
the feasibility of the proposed method for multitarget recognition
and speciation analysis. In addition, as an attempt of visual field
detection, the simple test strips have been successfully developed
and applied to visual monitoring of four metal ions with the detection
limit estimated by the naked eye to be as low as ppb level.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Reagents and Instruments
2-Melthylchinolin,
2-methyl-benzothiazol, and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Tripyridine-4-carbaldehyde
were obtained from Alpha Chemical Co. Ltd. All reagents were used
directly without purification. All the aqueous solutions used in this
experiment were ultrapure water with a resistivity of 18.25 MΩ
cm. Metal ion solution was preferably prepared using chloride, followed
by nitrate. Ferrous-ion solution was unstable in aqueous solution
and must be used immediately after preparation.

The structure
of obtained organic products was characterized by HRMS (GCT premier
CAB048 mass spectrometer) and 1H NMR (Bruker Avance 400
MHz NMR spectrometer). The absorbance spectra of Tpy-QL and Tpy-BZ
were collected from Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 spectrophotometer.

4.2 Synthesis of Terpyridyl-Based Colorimetric
Sensors
The Tpy-BZ was prepared according to the procedures
provided in the literature.29 2-Methylbenzothiazole
was first ethylated to hydrophilic benzothiazolium iodide. Briefly,
150 mg (1 mmol) of 2-methyl-benzothiazol and 156 mg (1 mmol) of iodoethane
were added into 20 mL of acetonitrile and then refluxed for 6 h. After
reaction, 150 mL of diethyl ether was introduced to precipitate the
solid and then the desired N-ethyl-2-methyl-benzothiazolium
iodide salt was collected by filtration under reduced pressure and
washed several times with diethyl ether. For the synthesis of Tpy-BZ,
0.2 mmol of obtained iodide salt and 0.2 mmol of tripyridine-4-carbaldehyde
were condensed in 5 mL of absolute ethanol at reflux for 12 h in the
dark under N2 atmosphere. After reaction, the mixtures
were concentrated under reduced pressure and purified by silica gel
column chromatography to get faint yellow Tpy-BZ (66.8 mg, yield 61%).
Tpy-QL was obtained by a similar synthetic procedure with a yield
of 56% (60.7 mg). The characterization data are provided in Figures S9–S16.

4.3 Spectral
Measurements
The stock solution
of probes and metal ions were prepared in 100% water solution with
the concentration of 0.2 mM. For Fe2+, Fe3+,
Co2+, and Hg2+ detection, 50 μL of probe
solution was first added into the quartz cuvette, followed by 50 μL
of PBS buffer solution (pH = 7.0, 10 mM) and 1.9 mL of water. Then,
different volumes of metal ions stock solution (0.2 mM) were successively
added into the sensor solution, the absorbance signal was collected
30 s after each addition. The responses of probe for other metal ions
were carried out using the same procedure.

4.4 Application
in Natural Water Samples
The detection effect of the proposed
colorimetric method for Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ were
carefully investigated in natural water by spiked different amounts
of standard sample. The natural water samples were collected from
tap water, Yangtze River water, and Jianghan Plain groundwater. The
obtained samples were first filtered to remove solid impurities and
then neutralized with PBS buffer solvent (pH = 7.0). For analysis,
the blank natural water samples were first analyzed by the proposed
colorimetric method. Then, different amounts of Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ were added into three
natural water samples, making the metal ion concentration in the water
samples to be 30, 100, and 300 ppb, respectively. The prepared samples
were tested immediately at room temperature using the proposed colorimetric
method, and each concentration was done in triplicate. The obtained
results were compared with the ICP-AES results.

The speciation
analysis of Fe2+/Fe3+ was operated in natural
water samples. For analysis, different concentrations of Fe2+ and Fe3+ (20/80, 50/50, 80/20 ppb) were first added to
the actual water samples, the total concentration of Fe2+ + Fe3+ was kept at 100 ppb, and then tested by the proposed
method. Each concentration was measured in triplicate and verified
by ICP-AES.

4.5 Preparation of Test Strips
for Visual Detection
The test strips for Fe2+,
Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ were prepared
based on the reported method
with minor modifications.30 One gram of
PVA was first introduced into 20 mL of water and then stirred vigorously
under heating until completely dissolved. After cooling to room temperature,
1 mL of Tpy-QL water solution (5 mM) was added into 5 mL of PVA solution
and stirred until it a clear solution was obtained. Finally, the mixtures
of Tpy-QL and PVA were evenly smeared on the surface of the common
filter paper and dried at room temperature. For the visual detection
of metal ions, different concentrations of Fe2+, Fe3+, Co2+, and Hg2+ were prepared in 10
mL beaker and then the obtained strips were immersed in different
metal ion solutions for 30 seconds.

4.6 Theoretical
Calculation
All of the
theoretical calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.31 The C, N, and H atoms were described by the
hybrid exchange–correlation functional B3LYP. 6-31G* basis
sets, and the metal atoms were described by Lanl2dz basis sets. All
of the electron density analyses were performed using the Multiwfn
package.32
