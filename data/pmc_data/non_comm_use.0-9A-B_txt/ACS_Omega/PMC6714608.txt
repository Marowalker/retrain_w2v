This work reports the development
of a fast and simple route for
the synthesis of ZnO sea urchin (SU) nanostructures by the formation
and assembly of ZnO nanorods under favorable growth conditions in
an aqueous solution. The thermal treatment of a basic zinc acetate
solution in ethanol results in the formation of aggregated seed clusters
consisting of small ZnO nanorods, which were then grown in a precursor
solution containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and hexamethylenetetramine to assemble the SU structures from the
anisotropic ZnO nanorods on the surface of the seed clusters. Each
ZnO nanoparticle in the aggregated seed clusters grew sequentially
into a ZnO nanorod, and the nanorods were concentric to the core of
the clusters yielding the unique SU-like shape. In the presence of
a capping agent such as cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), the
aggregated seed clusters were not formed, and the growth of the CTAB-capped
ZnO nanorods resulted in separated rods with average aspect ratios
of ∼10. The SU ZnO nanostructures exhibit a hexagonal wurtzite
crystal structure and higher specific surface area (26.9 m2/g) than the CTAB-capped nanorods (17.7 m2/g). The SU
ZnO nanostructures show superior photocatalytic efficiency for the
degradation of three common organic dyes compared to the ZnO nanorods.
The removal efficiencies of indigo carmine, methylene blue, and rhodamine
B by the SU nanostructures were 99, 86, and 96%, respectively, after
1 h of UV irradiation. Therefore, the ZnO SU structures have the potential
to be a versatile photocatalyst for the photodegradation of organic
dyes in industrial wastewater.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, 3-dimensional (3D) semiconductor metal oxide nanostructures
have gained considerable attention due to their wide range of applications
in numerous fields.1−4 However, very few semiconductors possess the attention that ZnO
has received mainly due to its unique chemical and physical properties.1−5 ZnO exhibits a wide bandgap (3.37 eV), high intrinsic electron mobility
(∼300 cm2 V–1 s–1), and high exciton binding energy (60 meV).5 ZnO is an n-type semiconductor, which can be converted to a p-type
by doping elements such as N and Na.6−8 ZnO is also well renowned
for its long-term stability under extreme conditions in addition to
its biocompatibility and biosafety.9,10 Due to these
unique properties, inexpensive material cost, and high abundance with
properly manipulated synthetic strategies and device engineering,
ZnO has been successfully used as a cost-effective material in a number
of diverse applications including photocatalysis, photovoltaics, sensors,
active antibacterial surfaces, optoelectronics, and batteries.11−20

It has always been a challenging task to obtain well-defined
3D
architectures of ZnO with a proper understanding of the crystal growth.
Over the years, a significant amount of research efforts has been
dedicated to developing facile synthetic routes to obtain different
3D nanostructures of ZnO.1−5,21−24 Compared to one-dimensional structures
such as rods and wires and two-dimensional structures such as thin
films and disks, 3D nanostructures exhibit unique features such as
high surface area, low aggregation, and superior carrier mobility,
which can serve well in photocatalysis and sensing applications. Common
3D nanostructures studied in the literature include tetrapods,25,26 hollow27,28 and nonhollow spheres,29 and flower-like structures,14,23,30−32 which are synthesized using different
strategies such as hydrothermal, template-assisted aging, and chemical
vapor deposition.25−32

General approaches to obtain 3D architectures include the
utilization
of template directional growth29 or selective
manipulation of growth rates of specific crystal facets using surfactants.33−35 For example, Sun et al. developed a hydrothermal route where a zinc
amino complex is autoclaved at 180 °C for 12 h to obtain a sea
urchin-like 3D architecture for gas sensing applications.36 However, a detailed mechanistic understanding
of the growth of these nanostructures can be limited by the growth
technique. For instance, it can be laborious to track the sequential
growth of a nanostructure if the hydrothermal technique is used.

Based on the World Bank estimation, 17–20% of contributors
for the water pollution is related to the textile industry.37 Annual production of textile dyes is almost
a million tons, and around 15% of it is generally released to natural
water bodies with minimal or no treatment.37,38 Photodegradation of organic dyes is one of the most widely studied
and important areas of photocatalysis, which has the advantages of
the usage of costless, inexhaustible, and clean solar energy.39 Semiconductor metal oxides, such as ZnO, an
efficient photocatalyst, can be used as a cost-effective tool for
pollution control due to the unique chemical and physical properties
mentioned earlier. In this work, we present a simple two-step aqueous
phase synthetic route to obtain 3D sea urchin (SU)-shaped ZnO nanostructures.
Compared to the reported techniques, this synthetic strategy does
not involve harsh growth conditions or expensive instruments and only
requires 2 h to be completed.40 More importantly,
a mechanistic study of the sequential formation and growth processes
of the SU nanostructures is reported. Furthermore, the photocatalytic
activity of the SU ZnO nanostructures is evaluated based on the photodegradation
of three organic dyes, indigo carmine (IC), rhodamine B (Rh B), and
methylene blue (MB). The results provide evidence for the superior
photocatalytic efficiency of the SU ZnO nanostructures.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images
of the synthesized ZnO seeds are shown in Figure 1. The TEM images (Figure 1a,b) suggest that the ZnO seeds are clusters
of small rod-shaped ZnO nanoparticles. The small ZnO nanoparticles
in the size range of 4–6 nm are aggregated to form spherical
seed clusters, which are around 80 nm in size, as shown in Figure 1c,d.

Figure 1 TEM (a, b) and SEM (c,
d) images of ZnO seeds.

To gain insight on the
mechanism of the formation of the ZnO seeds,
TEM images of the growing seeds were recorded at different time intervals
(5, 15, 30, 60 min), as shown in Figure 2a–d. After adding the base to zinc
acetate, the solution became cloudy in about 5 min indicating the
formation of the ZnO seeds, as shown in the TEM image in Figure 2a. In the absence
of a capping agent in the solution, the ZnO nanoparticles started
to aggregate under the constant heating at 60 °C, as shown in
the TEM image in Figure 2b recorded after 15 min from adding the base. The aggregation of
the individual nanoparticles continues, and a large number of small
individual nanoparticles started to be replaced by a smaller number
of larger aggregated clusters, as shown in TEM image in Figure 2c recorded after 30 min from
adding the base. Finally, the growth process of the seed aggregates
appeared to be terminated after 60 min as shown in the TEM image in Figure 2d where the small
individual ZnO nanoparticles were totally replaced by a few aggregated
clusters in the size range of 80–100 nm. The disappearance
of the initially formed small ZnO nanocrystals and the formation of
the larger aggregated clusters are a direct consequence of the Ostwald
ripening mechanism where the small nanocrystals attain a lower-energy
state by transformation into large aggregated clusters with reduced
surface to volume ratios.41

Figure 2 TEM images (a–d)
showing the sequential growth of ZnO nanoparticles
to form seed clusters at different time intervals of 5, 15, 30, and
60 min, respectively, from adding the base to the zinc acetate solution
at 60 °C. (e) UV–vis spectra corresponding to the solutions
used for images (a–d).

The growth of the seed clusters was also studied by recording the
UV–vis absorption spectra at different times, as shown in Figure 2e. The absorption
edge at 334 nm due to electronic transitions between the valence and
conduction bands in the initially formed nanocrystals (5 min) is significantly
blue-shifted from the absorption of bulk ZnO, which absorbs at approximately
385 nm (3.2 eV).5 The absorption edge is
red-shifted from 334 nm (3.71 eV) to 350 nm (3.54 eV) after the complete
growth of the aggregated clusters (60 min) indicating a decrease in
bandgap due to increasing particle size. The increase in the bandgap
of the small seed clusters is attributed to the quantum confinement
mechanism and the seed clusters grow to larger sizes, the bandgap
decreases toward the bulk bandgap. These aggregated seed clusters
are stable as a suspension in ethanol as confirmed by the TEM images
(similar to the image shown in Figure 2d) taken after being suspended in ethanol for 1 week.

The main hypothesis in the present synthesis approach is that the
formation of ZnO-aggregated seed clusters (Figure 2d) is the key requirement for the secondary
growth process to form the unique “sea urchin”-shaped
ZnO nanostructures. To test this hypothesis, a capping agent cetyl
trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) was added to the zinc acetate solution
to prevent the aggregation of the initially formed ZnO nanocrystals
into the aggregated seed clusters. As expected, the very small ZnO
nanocrystals remained separated and only exhibited a small degree
of growth after 1 h of heat treatment at 60 °C (Figure S1). Without CTAB, the absorption edge of the ZnO-aggregated
clusters increased to 350 nm after 1 h of heating at 60 °C, as
shown in Figure 2e.
However, in the presence of CTAB, the absorption edge of the ZnO seeds
increased only to 336 nm from the original value of 321 nm (Figure S1e) indicating a minimal aggregation
of the nanocrystal seeds and a small increase in particles’
size.

To compare the growth patterns of the ZnO seeds in the
absence
and presence of CTAB, both types of seeds were incubated at 90 °C
in a solution containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and HMTA. After the thermal hydrolysis of HMTA, NH3 is slowly released to the solution which then hydrolyzes in the
presence of water to form NH4(OH).42 As the solution becomes basic, Zn2+ ions react with OH– to form ZnO, as shown in eqs 1–3. 1   2   3  In the case of
uncapped ZnO seeds (no CTAB),
the growth of the aggregated clusters results in the formation of
ZnO rods, which grow along the [0001] direction in a pattern where
all of the rods are concentric to the core of the seed cluster yielding
the sea urchin-like shape, as shown in the TEM images in Figure 3 recorded at different
time intervals of the growth process at 90 °C. Due to the polar
nature of the ZnO lattice structure, the surface can be either negatively
or positively charged depending on the crystal structure of the terminated
plane. Zn-terminated planes will be positively charged, whereas O-terminated
planes will be negatively charged. Depending on the charge, the surface
will attract counterions in the medium (OH– or Zn2+) and form a layer of alternating charges on the surface
resulting in an ordered ZnO lattice.42 This
sequence will continue to form an ordered ZnO lattice in the [0001]
direction until the concentration of the precursor ions in the solution
is depleted. Each nanoparticle on the surface of the seed clusters
shown in Figure 3a
has the potential to grow into a rod, and this is shown clearly in Figure 3b,c where the rods
are grown on the surface of the seed cluster. At a longer growth time,
the grown rods become longer and sharper before the growth is terminated
by the depletion of the ions in the growth solution as shown in the
TEM image in Figure 3d recorded after 60 min during the growth process. The absorption
edge of the developed SU ZnO nanostructures exhibits a small red shift
to 370 nm compared to the original value of 355 nm of the seed clusters,
as shown in Figure 3e.

stages, 0 min (a), 15 min (b), 30 min (c), 60 min (d), and UV/vis
spectra of the SU ZnO at different growth time intervals, as shown
in (e).

Figure 4 displays
TEM and SEM images of the full-grown SU ZnO nanostructures. The size
distribution of the SU nanostructures ranges from 0.5 to 1.5 μm
most likely due to the stagnant growth in the absence of stirring.
Interestingly, the growth of the CTAB-capped ZnO seeds did not result
in the formation of SU structures but only separated rods with average
aspects ratios of ∼10, as shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information). This result supports the hypothesis
that the formation of the aggregated seed clusters shown in Figure 3a is necessary for
the growth of the SU structures. It appears that these aggregated
seed clusters act as efficient heterogeneous nuclei for the addition
of ZnO units to develop the 3D sea urchin structures.

SEM images (c, d) of the SU ZnO nanostructures.

Figure 5a,b displays
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the grown SU nanostructures
and the seed clusters of ZnO, respectively. In both cases, the crystal
structure belongs to the hexagonal wurtzite structure of bulk ZnO
with the space group P63mc. However,
the ZnO seed clusters (Figure 5b) show broader XRD peaks compared to the SU ZnO (Figure 5a) due to the smaller
particle size. Also, the peak intensity representing the (002) plane
is relatively small in the seeds, and it increases significantly in
the SU structures, which confirms the suggested mechanism for the
growth of the SU structures.

Figure 5 XRD patterns of SU ZnO (a), ZnO seeds (b) and
TEM images showing
how the seeds transformed into SU-shaped ZnO.

To further confirm the hexagonal wurtzite structure of the SU ZnO
nanostructures, the Raman spectra of the SU ZnO and the ZnO rods (formed
in the presence of CTAB) are shown in Figure 6. In both cases, the prominent peak at 437
cm–1 corresponds to the nonpolar E2 (high)
optical phonon mode, and the 378 and 580 cm–1 are
attributed to the polar transverse optical (TO) A1 and
longitudinal optical (LO) E1 phonon modes, respectively.7 The peak at 332 cm–1 corresponds
to the 2E2 mode. According to the selection rules, Raman
active phonon resonance modes for the ZnO wurtzite structure are A1
+ 2E2 + E2.43 Therefore, the Raman data
shown in Figure 6 confirm
that the SU ZnO nanostructures have the hexagonal wurtzite crystal
structures.

2.2 Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
activity of the SU ZnO nanostructures was evaluated based on the photodegradation
efficiency of three organic dyes IC, MB, and Rh B under UV irradiation.
The results are shown in Figure 7, which displays the UV–visible spectra of Rh
B, IC, and MB recorded at different time intervals during the photodegradation
experiments. The degradation percentages of the Rh B, IC, and MB dyes
after UV irradiation for 1 h were determined as 96, 99, and 86%, respectively.
The photodegradation reactions for all of the three dyes follow pseudo-first-order
kinetics (Figure 7d),
and the degradation of IC shows the fastest kinetics with a rate constant
of 0.076 min–1. According to the data, MB exhibits
a slight resistance to photodegradation by the SU ZnO nanostructures
compared to the other two dyes. MB is the only anionic dye among the
three dyes, and SU ZnO surfaces are expected to possess a slightly
negative charge in aqueous solutions due to the surface hydrolysis.44 On account of the electrostatic repulsion, MB
showed a little drop in the absorption peak after the initial adsorption–desorption
equilibrium for 1 h, which is evident at the 0 min mark of Figure 7c. Weak electrostatic
adsorption of MB could shorten its retention time on the surface of
the SU ZnO catalyst, which would decrease its photodegradation efficiency.
On the other hand, a significant drop in the absorption peak intensity
was observed for the Rh B and IC dyes after the initial dark reaction
as shown in Figure 7a,b indicating strong electrostatic adsorption on the catalyst surface,
and, therefore, a rapid photodegradation was observed within 1 h irradiation
in both cases.

dyes (a)

of Rh B, IC, and MB.

Finally, the photocatalytic
activities of the SU ZnO nanostructures
and the ZnO rods in the photodegradation of the Rh B dye were compared.
As shown in Figure 8a,b, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO rods is significantly lower
than that of the SU nanostructures. As shown in Figure 8c,d, after 1 h of UV irradiation, ZnO rods
only degraded 34% of the dye (10 ppm), whereas the SU nanostructures
degraded 96% of the dye. The increased activity of the SU nanostructures
could be attributed to the BET specific surface area of 26.9 m2/g, which is significantly larger than that of ZnO rods (17.7
m2/g).45,46 The relevant N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms of the SU ZnO nanostructures and the ZnO rods are shown
in Figure S3 (Supporting Information).
The enhanced photocatalytic activity could also be attributed to the
porous structure of the SU ZnO nanostructures, which would enhance
the adsorption and probably the trapping of the organic dyes within
the assembly of the short rods for efficient photodegradation.

3 Conclusions
In summary, a simple approach
has been developed for the synthesis
of sea urchin nanostructures by the formation and assembly of ZnO
nanorods under favorable growth conditions in an aqueous solution.
The thermal treatment of a basic zinc acetate solution in ethanol
results in the formation of aggregated seed clusters consisting of
small ZnO nanorods, which were then grown in a precursor solution
containing Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and
hexamethylenetetramine to assemble the SU structures from the anisotropic
ZnO nanorods on the surface of the seed clusters. Each ZnO nanoparticle
in the aggregated seed clusters grew sequentially into a ZnO nanorod,
and the nanorods were concentric to the core of the clusters yielding
the unique SU-like shape. In the presence of a capping agent such
as CTAB, the aggregated seed clusters were not formed, and the growth
of the CTAB-capped ZnO nanorods resulted in separated rods with average
aspect ratios of ∼10. The SU ZnO nanostructures exhibit a hexagonal
wurtzite crystal structure and higher specific surface area (26.9
m2/g) than the CTAB-capped nanorods (17.7 m2/g). The SU ZnO nanostructures show superior photocatalytic efficiency
for the degradation of three common organic dyes compared to the ZnO
nanorods. The removal efficiencies of indigo carmine, methylene blue,
and rhodamine B by the SU nanostructures were 99, 86, and 96%, respectively,
after 1 h of UV irradiation. Therefore, the ZnO SU structures have
the potential to be a versatile photocatalyst for the photodegradation
of organic dyes in industrial wastewater.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Preparation and Characterization of Sea Urchin-Shaped
ZnO Nanorod Clusters
Zinc oxide seeds were prepared in a
colloidal solution using ethanol as the solvent according to the method
described in ref (39). In a typical synthesis, 2 mM zinc acetate [Zn(Ac)2,
Alfa Aesar] in ethanol was heat-treated for 30 min at 70 °C under
stirring in a water bath. Then, 4 mM potassium hydroxide [KOH, Sigma]
in ethanol was added dropwise. The molar ratio between Zn(Ac)2 and KOH was maintained at 1:1. Then, the temperature was
reduced to 60 °C with continued heating for 1 h under constant
stirring. The reaction solution started to become cloudy with time
indicating the formation of the ZnO seeds.

To synthesize sea
urchin-shaped ZnO nanorod clusters, an equimolar aqueous solution
of zinc nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, Sigma-Aldrich] and hexamethylenetetramine [HMTA, Sigma]
(20 mM) was used as the growth solution. First, 25 mL of the ZnO seed
solution and 100 mL of the growth solution were mixed together and
sonicated for 15 min to disperse the seeds well in the solution. Then,
the mixture was incubated in a water bath at 90 °C for 1 h without
stirring. Finally, the nanorod clusters were formed and separated
from the growth solution and washed with deionized water and ethanol
separately to remove the growth solution. The white powder of the
sea urchin-shaped ZnO was then oven-dried at 70 °C overnight.

The prepared zinc oxide samples were characterized using the following
techniques. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were obtained
using a Jeol JEM-1230 TEM with the Gatan Orius SC1000 side mount CCD
camera at 120 kV. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images were obtained
with a Hitachi SU-70 FE-SEM. UV–visible absorbance spectra
were obtained using an HP-8453 spectrophotometer. Powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns were acquired with the PANalytical MPD X’Pert
Pro with a copper filter (Cu Kα, λ = 1.5405 Å) at
45 kV and 40 mA with a scan speed of 0.5 2θ/min. Raman spectra
were obtained from Thermo Scientific DXR SmartRaman (532 nm). A micromeritics
3Flex surface characterization analyzer was used for the surface area
measurements. Samples were activated overnight at 100 °C, and
the nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were obtained
at 77 K to determine the BET surface area.

4.2 Photocatalytic
Experiments
Photocatalytic
activities of the prepared ZnO samples were evaluated based on the
photodegradation of three organic dyes, MB, Rh B, and IC, and the
photocatalytic experiment is briefly described as follows. A 4 W,
365 nm UV lamp was used as the source of irradiation, and a Petri
dish (diameter of 3.5 in.) was used as the reaction container. The
UV lamp was placed above the Petri dish irradiated with the UV light
at 365 nm. Before the irradiation experiment, 50 mL of the aqueous
solution containing dispersed ZnO nanostructures (0.25 mg/mL) and
the dye (10 ppm) was added into the container. Then, the solution
was kept in the dark for 1 h to achieve adsorption–desorption
equilibrium. Finally, the lamp was turned on, and the photocatalytic
reaction was started. Samples were taken at different time intervals
to analyze the concentration variation of the dyes. The photodegradation
efficiencies were calculated based on the UV–vis absorption
of the dyes at different irradiation times.

4.3 Analytical
Methods
The concentrations
of the dyes were determined by absorbance measurements due to their
strong absorption bands in the visible region and the linear correlation
between the dye concentration and the absorbance. The absorption peaks
of the samples were recorded by a UV–vis spectrophotometer
and each measurement was repeated at least three times, and the averaged
absorbance values are used to calculate the dye concentrations.
