The glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs) support the survival and functioning
of various neuronal populations. Thus, they could be attractive therapeutic
agents against a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases caused by
progressive death of GFLs responsive neurons. Small-molecule ligands
BT13 and BT18 show an effect on GDNF family receptor GFRα1 and
RET receptor tyrosine kinase RetA function. Thus, their potential
binding sites and interactions were explored in the GDNF–GFRα1–RetA
complex using molecular docking calculations as well as molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations. Three possible regions were examined: the
interface between GDNF and GFRα1 (region A), the RetA interface
with GFRα1 (region B), and a possible allosteric site in GFRα1
(region C). The results obtained by the docking calculations and the
MD simulations indicate that the preferable binding occurs at the
allosteric site. A less preferable binding site was detected on the
RetA surface interfacing GFRα1. In the membrane-bound state
of RetA this can enable compounds BT13 and BT18 to act as direct RetA
agonists. The analysis of the MD simulations shows hydrogen bonds
for BT13 and significant hydrophobic interactions with GFRα1
for BT13 and BT18 at the allosteric site.

==== Body
Introduction
The glial cell line-derived
neurotrophic factor (GDNF) family ligands (GFLs), which consist of
GDNF, neurturin (NRTN), artemin (ARTN), and persephin (PSPN), regulate
the development and maintenance of the nervous system.1 It has been shown that GDNF protects and repairs brain
dopamine-producing neurons, which degenerate in Parkinson’s
disease, and motoneurons, which die in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
In addition, GDNF, NRTN, and ARTN support the survival and regulate
the differentiation of many peripheral neurons, including sympathetic,
parasympathetic, sensory, and enteric neurons.2

The GFLs could therefore be attractive therapeutic agents
against a multitude of neurodegenerative diseases caused by the extensive
death of GFLs dependent neurons. Unfortunately, the systemic delivery
of GFLs into the central nervous system neurons is complicated because
of their poor pharmacokinetic properties and bioavailability that
are common to large proteins. The delivery to the brain through invasive
approaches such as neurosurgery, viral vectors, or by the use of encapsulated
cells is also associated with multiple obstacles. Consequently, small
molecules that specifically activate GFL receptors and that can be
easily delivered to the target neuronal populations would overcome
most of these problems.3

The first
small molecules that mimic the effects of the different GFLs have
been recently reported.4−7 The high-throughput screening of a library consisting of 18 400
drug-like compounds had enabled identifying compound code-named BT13
(N,N-diethyl-3-[4-[4-fluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)benzoyl]piperazin-1-yl]-4-methoxybenzenesulfonamide)
as a compound that selectively targeted GFL receptor RET to activate
downstream signaling cascades.4,5 It was found that BT13
activated luciferase in reporter-gene based systems in GFRα1/RET,
GFRα3/RET, and RET reporter cell lines with comparable potency
and efficacy at micromolar concentrations. The further rational design
lead to a compound BT18 ([4-[5-[(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydro-1H-isoquinolin-2-yl)sulfonyl]-2-methoxyphenyl]piperazin-1-yl]-[4-fluoro-2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]methanone)
with similar properties.6 Both compounds
demonstrated efficacy in rat model of experimental neuropathy.5,6 However, the molecular mechanism of the RET activation by the small-molecule
ligands BT13 and BT18 remained unclear.

Therefore, to elucidate
this question and to enable a rational design of more potent mimetics
of GDNF, it would be highly interesting to examine the possible interaction
between these known compounds with GDNF receptor complex consisting
of ligand-binding subunit GFRα1 and signal transducing module
transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase RetA.

The aim of this
study is therefore to explore the possible binding sites and interactions
of a small-molecule ligand BT135 and its
derivative BT186 (Figure 1) with protein GFRα1 and GFRα1–RetA
interface. These compounds are known to have an effect on GFRα1
and RetA functions.5,6 Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations8−10 may help to elucidate the binding site and time dynamics of interacting
amino acid residues and to extend the information obtained from previous
docking studies.

BT18.

Results and Discussion
Molecular Docking
Three possible regions in the receptor GFRα1 and RetA were
examined to find the potential binding poses of compounds BT13 and
BT18, using subunits of the protein structure from the GDNF–GFRα1–RetA
complex (PDB code: 4UX8;11 see Computational
Methods). These included the
interface between GDNF and GFRα1 (region A in Figure 2), the RetA interface with
GFRα1 (region B in Figure 2), and a possible allosteric site in GFRα1 (region
C in Figure 2). In
region A, the small-molecule ligands would directly mimic the effect
by binding GDNF to the receptor GFRα1. In region B that is located
in the surface of RetA, the effect of small compounds would be similar
to GDNF-activated GFRα1. Finally, there can be allosteric conformational
changes in GFRα1 due to the binding of small-molecule ligands
and leading to the activation of the complex (region C). Results from
molecular docking indicate that the preferable binding occurs at the
allosteric site for both ligands (see Figure 3). The docking score to region C is −7.9
kcal/mol for compound BT13, being 1.9 and 1.2 kcal/mol lower compared
to the binding score for regions A and B, respectively; and −9.8
kcal/mol for compound BT18 to region C, being 3.4 and 2.3 kcal/mol
lower than for the binding at other two regions.

complexes: (a) GFRα1–BT13 at the GDNF–GFRα1
interface, region A (ΔGbind = −6.0
kcal/mol); (b) GFRα1-BT18 at the GDNF–GFRα1 interface,

(c) RetA–BT13 at the RetA–GFRα1 interface, region
B (ΔGbind = −6.7 kcal/mol);
(d) RetA-BT18 at the RetA–GFRα1 interface, region B (ΔGbind = −7.5 kcal/mol); (e) GFRα1–BT13
at the allosteric site, region C (ΔGbind = −7.9 kcal/mol); and (f) GFRα1–BT18 at the
allosteric site, region C (ΔGbind = −9.8 kcal/mol). The amino acid residues of protein (PDB
code: 4UX8)
are colored as gray (carbon), blue (nitrogen), red (oxygen), and white
(hydrogen). Intermolecular hydrogen bonds are shown by dashed lines.

It has been noted5,6 that both BT13 and BT18 also act as RetA direct agonists. While
the present calculations indicate the preferable binding to the allosteric
site at region C, the binding site at RetA interface with GFRα1
(region B) may become preferential in membrane-bound state of RetA,
with altered conformation as compared to the protein structure in
single-particle state used in the measuring of structure (PDB code: 4UX8). The binding mode
at the RetA interface with GFRα1 (region B) involves hydrophobic
interactions between compound BT13 and residues of Thr120, Tyr122,
and Tyr146 as well as stacking (π–π) interactions
between the aromatic rings of BT13 and Trp37 (Figure 3c). BT18 also makes hydrophobic contacts
to Tyr146 and Thr170 and π–π interactions with
Trp37 (Figure 3d).

The binding mode at the allosteric site (region C) involves hydrogen
bonding between the sulfonyl group of the ligand BT13 and the ammonium
group of Lys327 of the receptor GFRα1, in addition to hydrophobic
contacts with Asn40, Phe41, Gln247, Lys251, Leu260, Ala261, and Phe328
(Figure 3e). The ligand
BT18 is hydrogen bonded by a methoxy group to the amine group of Asn40
of GFRα1 and has additional hydrophobic interactions with residues
of Phe41, Gln247, Lys251, Leu260, Ala261, Phe264, Asp324, Lys327,
and Phe328 (Figure 3f).

To verify our results obtained by using protein structure
of GDNF–GFRα1–RetA complex (PDB code: 4UX8), calculations using
crystal structure of the GDNF–GFRα1 complex (PDB code: 3FUB;12 see Computational Methods) were
carried out as a control. The GFRα1 parts of both structures
overlap very well (Figure 4a). The binding modes of ligands BT13 and BT18 are almost
identical at the GDNF–GFRα1 interface (Figure 4b,c) but somewhat different
at the allosteric site (Figure 4d,e), although the interacting residues of GFRα1 are
mostly the same. A possible reason is discussed below, in the next
section. All results of molecular docking for BT13 and BT18 are presented
in the Supporting Information in Table
S1.

MD with Desmond Simulation Package
The docking calculations were followed by MD simulations using Desmond
package on the three potential binding sites at regions A, B, and
C, respectively. The root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the atomic
positions behavior is notably large for the regions corresponding
to the GDNF–GFRα1 interface (region A) and RetA (region
B) (see Figure S1a–d). Smaller rmsd
variations show the stability of the ligand binding. Notably, in the
simulation of compounds BT13 and BT18 binding to the region C that
corresponds to the allosteric site on the receptor GFRα1, there
is no large variation of this parameter (Figure S1e,f). Thus, in accordance with the molecular docking results,
this binding site is preferable.

The location of the binding
modes of compounds BT13 and BT18 were also confirmed by the counterpart
MD modeling. The results at the allosteric site are however somewhat
different from that obtained in molecular docking calculations. There
is significant hydrophobic interaction between the ligand BT13 and
the receptor GFRα1 around protein residues Lys251 to Phe264
(see the protein–ligand contacts diagram in Figure 5a). Hydrogen bonding is involved
in interactions with the residues Phe41 and Thr265. Notably, the interactions
over the water molecule bridges are rather significant, for example,
the water-assisted ionic contact to Lys327, which was also shown by
the docking results. The ligand BT18 shows a very strong hydrophobic
interaction with the residue Phe41 (being in hydrophobic contact almost
100% of MD simulation time) besides other hydrophobic interactions
around protein residues Leu244 to Phe264 (see the protein–ligand
contacts diagram in Figure 5b). The water-assisted bindings are also represented. The
binding modes of the ligands at the regions A and B are quite similar
to the docking calculations and are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S2 and S3, respectively).

MD calculated protein–ligand contacts at the allosteric site,
region C: (a) GFRα1–BT13; (b) GFRα1–BT18.
Protein code: 4UX8.

MD simulations were also repeated
with the crystal structure of GDNF–GFRα1 complex (3FUB12) for BT13 and BT18 (see the corresponding rmsd of the atomic
positions for ligands and protein in Figure S4, protein–ligand contacts at the GDNF–GFRα1 interface
in Figure S5, and at the allosteric site
in Figure 6). The results
obtained for binding at the GDNF–GFRα1 interface are
similar, however, somewhat different at the allosteric site for two
protein structures used in this study (4UX8 and 3FUB). In fact, GFRα1 consists of domains
D1, D2, and D3, whereas D1 is not needed for GDNF binding,12 it binds to RetA in the full structure in 4UX8.11 According to our calculations, D1 has an effect on protein–ligand
interactions at the allosteric site as well as it would be significant
in determining the signaling-related conformational changes. Anyway,
no interaction between RET and GDNF or GFRα1 co-receptor individually
was detectable.11

protein–ligand contacts at the allosteric site, region C: (a)
GFRα1–BT13; (b) GFRα1–BT18. Protein code: 3FUB.

To specify the nature of the protein–ligand
interactions, the molecular mechanics/Poisson–Boltzmann surface
area (MM/PBSA)13 binding energy calculations
were carried out using data from MD simulations. In MM/PBSA, the free
energy of a state (ligand, protein, or complex) is estimated from
the following sum: 1  where the first three terms
are standard MM energy terms from bonded (bond, angle, and dihedral),
electrostatic, and van der Waals interactions, respectively. Gpol and Gnp are
the polar and nonpolar contributions to the solvation free energies,
respectively. Gpol is typically obtained
by solving the Poisson–Boltzmann equation or by using the generalized
Born (GB) model (giving the MM/GBSA approach), whereas the nonpolar
term is estimated from a linear relation to the solvent accessible
surface area. The last term in the above equation is the absolute
temperature, T, multiplied by the entropy, S, estimated by a normal-mode analysis of the vibrational
frequencies. The results for binding energy states14 at different sites are given in Table 1. The allosteric site on the receptor GFRα1
is predicted to be notably more preferable for binding the small-molecule
ligands. The corresponding binding free energy is −50.9 kcal/mol
for ligand BT13, being 3.4 and 2.4 kcal/mol lower compared with the
binding energy for regions A and B, respectively; −55.7 kcal/mol
for ligand BT18, being 5.0 and 5.9 kcal/mol lower than that for the
other potential binding regions.

MD with AMBER Package
To check if the binding of BT13
was stable at site C with a different program and force field, additional
AMBER simulations on compound BT13 were carried out at the allosteric
site of GFRα1, using the crystal structure of domain 3 of GFRα1
(PDB code: 1Q8D(15)). The simulations were stable throughout
the whole trajectories, as shown by small variation of energy, volume,
and pressure through time. The rmsd of the ligand seen in Figure S6 shows a stable binding interaction
with small deviations from the initial position. The rmsd of the alpha
carbons of the protein also shows stability in the protein structure
shown in Figure S7. In this respect, simulation
with AMBER reproduced the stable binding and complex formation at
site C.

Analysis of the trajectories showed that the loop of
residues Pro32 to Cys40 was the most mobile part of the protein, with
the loop closing in on top of ligand BT13. Among the most mobile residues
in this loop were Arg35 (Arg272 in the full structure in 4UX8) with an rmsd per
residue of 7.9 Å as shown in Table S2, Figure 7, and Figure S8, along with the edge residue Tyr17
(Tyr254 in the full structure in 4UX8) of 9.3 Å, as compared to the average
value of 6.4 Å for all protein residues and the ligand. Important
to notice is that Arg272 and Tyr254 are precisely the residues that
make contact between GFRα1 and RetA in structure 4UX8 that contains these
proteins in addition to GDNF in a ternary complex. Also important
to note is that residue 105 corresponding to ligand BT13, had a below
average rmsd of 5.9 Å, which again shows stability in the binding
interaction. Residues 106 and 107 also had high rmsd’s as is
to be expected because they are free sodium ions in solution.

(shown in red quadrate) and contacts with RetA.

The closure of the loop brings into contact protein groups
Arg272 and the ligand sulfonamide and aromatic atoms, as seen in Figure 8 and Table 2. In addition, the fluorine
and amide carbonyl groups of the ligand make stable hydrogen bonds
with Gln10 (Gln247 in 4UX8) in the protein, as shown in Figure 8 and Table 2. The AMBER MD results are in agreement with the Desmond
MD results, as these residues are also the most important contributors
to the binding of BT13 in the Desmond MD simulations.

Conclusions
The binding pose of
compounds BT13 and BT18 to the allosteric site of GFRα1 seems
to be stable throughout several long enough MD simulation times, maintaining
complexation and hydrogen bonding for BT13 as well as hydrophobic
contacts with preferred partners on the protein for BT13 and BT18.
Given that the loop in GFRα1 has strong interactions with the
ligand BT13 and is also in close contact to its partner RetA (Arg272
in GFRα1; Tyr76, Tyr122, and Tyr146 in RetA) as well as the
GFRα1 edge residue Tyr254 being in close contact to Lys75 and
Glu77 in RetA, the conformational changes seen in the protein in the
GFRα1–BT13 complex may affect binding to RetA, and in
turn, induce conformational changes in RetA, which may lead to its
activation.

However, as noted above, both ligands also act as
RetA direct agonists. Thus, apparently the binding site at RetA interface
with GFRα1 (region B) becomes preferential in membrane-bound
state of RetA like that has different conformation as compared to
the protein structure in single-particle state used in this modeling
work. This enables compounds BT13 and BT18 to act as direct agonists
of RetA.

However, the binding of the studied compounds to either
component of GDNF receptor complex (co-receptor or RetA) is predominantly
originating from the rather loose and nonspecific hydrophobic and
van der Waals interactions and the favored binding site is rather
flat. Thus, it might not be easy to increase the binding efficiency
of the ligands and minor modifications in the ligand structure can
lead to substantial changes in their binding mode and inactivation.
Nevertheless, the present elucidation of the detailed mechanism of
interaction between the known active compounds and the GFRα1
and RetA receptor complex enables further rational design of highly
effective GDNF mimicking small molecules.

Computational Methods
Small-Molecule
Ligands and Target
The structure of ligand BT13 had been
obtained through a high-throughput screening procedure;5 compound BT18 is a further development of this
structure.6 We proceeded from a protein
and two crystal structures on the GDNF–GFRα1 complex
downloaded from Protein Data Bank (PDB).16 The hybrid structural model of reconstituted mammalian GDNF–GFRα1–RetA
complex (PDB code: 4UX8) had been derived from electron microscopy (EM) and low-angle X-ray
scattering (SAXS) data with a resolution 24.0 Å.11 Combination of cryo-EM and SAXS can be a suitable method
to study such kind of big protein complexes. This protein structure
was previously also exploited for homology modeling, MD simulations,
and molecular docking studies.17 The complex
consists of chain A and chain B (RetA extracellular domain; residues
29–508), chain C and chain E (GFRα1 with domains D1–D3;
residues 6–348), and chain D and chain F (GDNF; residues
42–134). The crystal structure of GDNF–GFRα1 complex
(PDB code: 3FUB) contains two chains of GFRα1 (chain A, residues 150–348; chain C, residues 150–348) and two chains of GDNF (chain B, residues 40–134; chain D, residues 32–134) as measured
by X-ray diffraction with a resolution 2.35 Å.12 Another crystal structure (PDB code: 1Q8D) containing the
GDNF family co-receptor alpha 1 domain 3 has been reported as measured
by X-ray diffraction with a resolution 1.80 Å15 and consists of chain A (GFRα1; residues 239–346). Protein structures were
prepared (including energy minimization) and hydrogen atoms were added
using the Protein Preparation Wizard18 in
the Schrödinger Maestro19 software,
assuming a pH of 7.4. Possible hydrogen bond interactions, the solvent
exposure, and the local surroundings of the histidine residues by
visual inspection were also analyzed. All water molecules were kept
in the calculations of MD simulation. Water molecules were removed
from the protein structure of GDNF–GFRα1–RetA
complex and the crystal structure of GDNF–GFRα1 complex
for the docking study.

Molecular Docking
The binding poses
of BT13 and BT18 on the GDNF–GFRα1–RetA complex
(PDB code: 4UX8) were obtained by docking calculations using AutoDock Vina 1.1.2.20 The ligands were optimized before molecular
docking by the Ligand Preparation21 (OPLS_2005
force field) in the Schrödinger Maestro19 software. The active binding site on GFRα1 (selected
residues of domain D2 in chain C), named region A, was obtained by the removal of GDNF (chain D). The active binding site on RetA
(selected residues of cadherin-like domains 1 and 2 in chain A), named region B, was obtained by
the removal of GFRα1 (chain C). Both regions were surrounded with a grid box sized 20 × 20
× 20 points with a spacing of 1.000 Å. The allosteric binding
site in the middle of GFRα1 (selected residues of domains D1–D3
in chain C), named region C, was
surrounded with a grid box sized 30 × 40 × 20 points with
a spacing of 1.000 Å. The settings used for the iterated local
search global optimizer based on mutation and local optimization steps
accepted or rejected with a Metropolis criterion in Vina were nine
modes, one central processing unit, and an energy range of 1 kcal/mol.
Other settings were used as default. AutoDockTools (ADT)22 1.5.6 was used to identify the binding sites
as well as to analyze interactions between protein and ligands. The
same procedure and the same parameters, that is, coordinates and size
of grid box, were also used in case of the GDNF–GFRα1
complex (PDB code: 3FUB).

Molecular Dynamics
The MD simulations were carried
out using Desmond simulation package of Schrödinger LLC.23 The NPT ensemble with the temperature
300 K and a pressure 1 bar was applied in all runs. The simulation
length was 50 ns with a relaxation time 1 ps for the ligands BT13
and BT18. The OPLS_2005 force field parameters were used in all simulations.24 The long-range electrostatic interactions were
calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method.25 The cutoff radius in Coulomb interactions was 9.0 Å.
The water molecules were explicitly described using the simple point
charge model.26 The Martyna–Tuckerman–Klein
chain coupling scheme27 with a coupling
constant of 2.0 ps was used for the pressure control and the Nosé–Hoover
chain coupling scheme27 for the temperature
control. Nonbonded forces were calculated using an r-RESPA integrator
where the short-range forces were updated every step and the long-range
forces were updated every three steps. The trajectories were saved
at 4.8 ps intervals for analysis. The behavior and interactions between
the ligands and protein were analyzed using the Simulation Interaction
Diagram tool implemented in Desmond MD package. The stability of MD
simulations was monitored by looking on the rmsd of the ligand and
protein atom positions in time.

The AMBER 14 package28 with AMBER force field ff9929 was also used to minimize, add counterions, solvate, equilibrate,
and run periodic box, explicit water (TIP4P) MD simulations for ligand
BT13. The structure of molecule BT13 was optimized using the density
functional theory B3LYP method30 with 6-31G
basis set and parameters set to the GAFF force field. The protein–ligand–water
system was allowed to move freely. Simulations were 10 independent
runs with different random initial velocities, each of them 10 ns
long, using a 0.001 ps (1 fs) timestep. These are multiple molecular
dynamics simulations, which are widely accepted9,31 and
can sample enough conformational space as longer, single trajectory
simulations. The data analysis was carried out with the cpptraj program
(AMBER Tools distribution).28
