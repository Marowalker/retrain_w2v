Adoptive cell therapy,
i.e., the extraction, manipulation, and
administration of ex vivo generated autologous T cells to patients,
is an emerging alternative to regular procedures in cancer treatment.
Nevertheless, these personalized treatments require laborious and
expensive laboratory procedures that should be alleviated to enable
their incorporation into the clinics. With the objective to improve
the ex vivo expansion of large amount of specific T cells, we propose
the use of three-dimensional (3D) structures during their activation
with artificial antigen-presenting cells, thus resembling the natural
environment of the secondary lymphoid organs. Thus, the activation,
proliferation, and differentiation of T cells have been analyzed when
cultured in the presence of two 3D systems, Matrigel and a 3D polystyrene
scaffold, showing an increase in cell proliferation compared to standard
suspension systems.

1 Introduction
The
immune system is prepared to distinguish self from nonself
entities, to be able to protect the organism from the invasion of
threatening pathogens.1 Nevertheless, the
self origin of cancer cells can result in immune evasion, which is
considered as one of the hallmarks of cancer cells.2 Encouragingly, genetic engineering techniques are showing
promising results in the production of engineered T cells with high
specificity and efficiency toward tumor recognition and elimination.
Indeed, the use of engineered T cells in adoptive cell therapy (ACT),
resulted in partial or total remissions in patients with relapsed
or refractory hematological malignancies, in clinical trials.3 However, ACT still faces challenges to overcome
to accelerate its broad adoption, such as a more efficient expansion
of T cells ex vivo of relevant phenotypes.3

Cells are able to sense and respond to chemical and mechanical
properties of their environment,4−9 causing for example, Tyr phosphorylation or dephosphorylation, binding
of specific lipids, or morphological changes.10 Although two-dimensional (2D) cultures provide very valuable information
about cellular biology,11−13 these techniques can introduce
artifacts to the natural cell behavior, due to the adaptation of cells
to flat surfaces,9 which differ from their
three-dimensional (3D) in vivo environment. Thus, the development
of suitable 3D environments for cell culture is highly desired, which
not only would benefit cell culture techniques, but also tissue engineering,
which aims at regenerating tissues or creating study models through
cell–material interactions. T cell activation occurs in the
secondary lymphoid organs after the interaction of antigen-presenting
cells with T cells. These organs have a highly complex and densely
packed structure with specific mechanical and chemical characteristics14 that allow cellular densities that are 3 orders
of magnitude higher than standard cell cultures. Among the various
technologies available for scaffold-based 3D cell culture, which would
allow an immediate benefit given their potentially fast and low-cost
transfer to the clinics, hydrogels stand as a popular option due to
their biocompatibility, stiffness, porosity, and ability to be functionalized
to mimic the extracellular matrix (ECM).9 Matrigel (Corning) is a well-defined gelatinous protein mixture
extract prepared from the Engelbreth–Holm–Swarm mouse
sarcoma, a tumor with an abundant ECM that resembles basement membranes.15 The major components of Matrigel are laminin,
collagen IV, heparan sulfate proteoglycans, nidogen, and growth factors,
which provide both structural and signal transduction functions.16 It has pores of 25–300 nm and a stiffness
of 443 Pa,17 similar to other ECM-based
hydrogels, such as mixtures of collagen-1 and laminin (60:40),18 but softer than typical synthetic hydrogels,
such as poly(ethylene glycol) dimethacrylate.19 Matrigel has been used in various 3D cell culture studies, mainly
involving cancer cell types, such as mammary carcinoma,20 tongue carcinoma,21 and prostate carcinoma.22 However, to
the best of our knowledge, these studies are limited to the analysis
of the invasiveness and migration capacity of the cells. These assays
showed that T cell migration depends on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)
secretion, through the correlation of MMP inhibitors and migration
blocking in a dose-dependent manner.23 Similarly,
T lymphoblastoma cell migration was also shown to be dependent on
MMP secretion.24 Specifically, the IL-2
secretion resulted in an increased MMP production, which enabled the
activation of cells, which were then able to traverse the dense Matrigel
matrix. Alternatively, polymer scaffolds are interesting for 3D cell
cultures due to their diverse fabrication techniques available, such
as emulsion polymerization,25 foaming,26 phase separation,27 electrospinning,28 or 3D printing.29 These techniques enable the production of scaffolds
with controlled dimensions and a porous structure, important characteristics
for a suitable cell culture system. Given that plasma-treated polystyrene
is a ubiquitous material for standard 2D cell culture, it is not surprising
that polystyrene scaffolds have been developed to serve as 3D cell
culture systems.25−27 The 3D polystyrene scaffold (3D Biotek) consists
of layers of parallel fibers with a stiffness of ∼3GPa and
a diameter of 300 μm, arranged at 90° and offset to each
other. The resulting pore size of this structure is 400 μm.
Such 3D polystyrene scaffold was tested for the amplification of lymphoma
cancer cells, incubating mantle cell lymphoma cells in the presence
of neighboring stroma cells achieving a remarkable proliferation efficiency.30 Thus, commercial 3D systems hold great potential
for the culture of various cell types, not only as therapeutic agents,
e.g., as prosthesis to be implanted to patients, but also as model
systems to study physiological and pathogenic behaviors. Here, we
analyzed the effect of adding a 3D environment to activate primary
human CD4+ T cells, with the objective of enhancing the
T cell expansion of relevant phenotypes in short periods of time to
contribute to the improvement of ACT. For that two remarkably different
biomaterials were chosen, Matrigel and a 3D polystyrene scaffold,
to contemplate the broad spectrum of structural and physicochemical
properties that current commercial materials can offer and assure
that the effects observed are caused by the 3D environment and not
by a particular characteristic of the scaffold.

2 Results
and Discussion
Primary human CD4+ T cells purified
from peripheral
blood (purity CD3+CD4+ T cells > 90%) were
polyclonally
activated using Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific), which are magnetic
beads of 4.5 μm in size coated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 that
act as artificial antigen-presenting cells. Specifically, anti-CD3
interacts with the CD3ε chain of the T cell receptor (TCR)–CD3
complex, resulting in T cell activation, whereas anti-CD28 provides
a costimulatory signal needed to avoid anergy. Three different environments
were used, which consisted of a static suspension, Matrigel, and a
3D polystyrene scaffold. To evaluate T cell activation, the secretion
of the cytokine IL-2 was analyzed. IL-2 is rapidly secreted by activated
T cells and is known to support T cell proliferation and differentiation.31 Consequently, IL-2 is used in clinics to evaluate
lymphocyte function and was used here to evaluate the performance
of the 3D structures through an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) 1 day after seeding (Figure 1). CD4+ T cells activated in suspension
(positive control), i.e., without any 3D platform, showed a median
value of 44.6 ng/mL, with most measured values falling into the range
between 36.3 and 51.0 ng/mL (percentiles Q-25 and Q-75), due to the
intrinsic variability of primary samples. These values are significantly
higher than those obtained in both the 3D polystyrene scaffolds, with
a median value of 23.5 ng/mL, and Matrigel, which shows negligible
IL-2 results in the majority of samples. Although a diminished secretion
cannot be discarded, obstructed diffusion or even retention of IL-2
to the matrices could also explain the observed results. More specifically,
this phenomenon could be caused by proteoglycans in Matrigel, whereas
in the 3D polystyrene scaffold, it would be rather unspecific.32

Figure 1 IL-2 secretion of CD4+ T cells seeded in suspension
(positive control), a 3D polystyrene scaffold, and Matrigel on day
1. All cultures were stimulated with Dynabeads for activation. The
results shown were obtained from Ndonors = 9 and statistical significance was determined by the Mann–Whitney U test (***p < 0.001).

In addition to the quantification of IL-2, the
activation of T
cells was also assessed by changes on cell morphology. Figure 2 shows that prior to activation,
cells exhibit a round morphology, whereas activated T cells show larger
sizes and elongated shapes, compatible with the ameboid migration
mode, as previously reported.33 To quantify
these changes, the area, perimeter, aspect ratio (AR), and circularity
of cells were analyzed. The median area of resting cells was of 43.4
μm2 (negative control), whereas cells activated in
suspension and in the 3D polystyrene scaffold exhibited significantly
larger areas with median values of 114.8 and 109.2 μm2, respectively. The median area of activated cells using Matrigel
was of 41.3 μm2 (Figure 2E). Similarly, the perimeter and AR followed
the tendencies observed for cell area (Figure 2F,G). The median value of the cell perimeter
of resting cells and cells seeded in Matrigel was of 23.3 μm,
whereas the ones in suspension and 3D polystyrene scaffold increased
to 40.2 and 37.9 μm, respectively. The AR of resting cells was
7.3, which grew to 11.2 for cells activated in suspension and in the
3D polystyrene scaffold. Cells activated on Matrigel showed an AR
of 6.7. Alternatively, the circularity of cells, which is proportional
to the area divided by the square of the perimeter, showed statistical
changes in all activated cells in comparison to the negative control.
Although the median values were similar (1.03 for the negative control
and 1.05 for the rest of the cases), the variability of shapes was
higher in the samples with activated cells, as represented by the
larger box charts (Figure 2H). As expected, when T cells are activated, they express
cell adhesion receptors that allow their spreading and adhesion, especially
to available two-dimensional (2D) substrates, such as the endothelium
lining, resulting in different shapes and sizes in comparison to the
completely spherical shape of the resting form.34

and (D) using Matrigel cells with supply of Dynabeads (dark spheres

Analysis of cell morphometric parameters: (E) area, (F) perimeter,
(G) aspect ratio (AR), and (H) circularity were analyzed on day 2.
The results shown were obtained from Ndonors/condition = 3, with a minimum of Ncells/donor =
20. Statistical significance was determined by the Mann–Whitney U test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

The morphological differences
observed in Matrigel compared to
cells obtained in suspension or seeded in the 3D polystyrene scaffold
could be explained by the dimensionality of the material.35−37 The T cells seeded in suspension but analyzed under the optical
microscope, tend to be those attached to the bottom of the culture
well, thus responding to a flat substrate. Similarly, the large pore
size of the 3D polystyrene scaffold, might also promote some 2D interactions.
In contrast, Matrigel offers a truly 3D structure, which promotes
spherical shapes with blebs as protrusions characteristic of the ameboid
migration.34 Although such migration mode
usually results in low adhesion, the dense mesh of Matrigel consisting
of ECM proteins and growth factors, could also play a role through
modifications on the phenotype obtained after proliferation.

In the next step, T cell proliferation was assessed through the
expansion, replication, and proliferation indexes (Figure 3). The expansion and replication
indexes determine the fold-expansion of the whole population and of
responding cells, respectively. A higher value in these parameters
correlates with a higher quantity of cells after the proliferative
process. The proliferation index is the number of divisions that cells
from the original population have undergone divided by the number
of divided cells. Thus, this parameter considers the number of responsive
cells, i.e., a higher value correlates with a higher response to a
proliferative stimulus. These three parameters are therefore relevant
for cell therapy, showing how responsive the cells are to the proliferative
stimulus, how much they divide after sensing this stimulus, and how
many cells can finally be obtained. After 5 days of culture, Matrigel
samples showed a median expansion index of 11.2, whereas the suspension
exhibited an 8.9 and the 3D polystyrene scaffold an 11.1. In other
words, for each million of cells seeded, Matrigel samples reached
11.2 million cells, the 3D polystyrene scaffold achieved 11.1 million
cells, whereas in suspension, 8.9 million cells were obtained.

Although the median value of the 3D polystyrene
scaffold is similar
to Matrigel, it does not show significant differences in comparison
with the positive control, as it does Matrigel. The replication index,
which measures culture expansion of the responding cells, was of 19.1
for Matrigel, 12.6  for the positive control and 15.1 for the
3D polystyrene scaffold. These results indicate that the response
of activated T cells was more effective in Matrigel samples than in
the 3D polystyrene scaffold and the positive control. Similarly, Matrigel
showed a median proliferation index value of 3.1 compared to the 2.6
and the 2.9 of suspension cells and the 3D polystyrene scaffold, respectively.
Thus, the total number of divisions performed by the responding cells
was significantly higher in Matrigel than in suspension. Additionally,
the 3D polystyrene scaffold exhibited the same tendency, although
for this system, the difference was not statistically different until
day 6, when the median value of the expansion index rose from 14.2
of the positive control to 22.1, the replication index median increased
from 19.8 to 29.8, and the proliferation index ascended from 3.1 to
3.4. These results show the efficacy of these 3D environments given
by the scaffolds in increasing proliferation compared to the standard
culture in suspension and therefore suggest that the lack of IL-2
measured through ELISA was not due to an inefficient activation, but
rather due to adhesion of IL-2 in the 3D matrices.

To determine
the phenotype of the CD4+ T cells after
proliferation, differentiation assays were performed 5 days after
seeding (Figures 4 and S1). Two cell receptors were separately stained,
CD45RA and CD45RO, given that following mitogenic stimulation, naive
T cells gradually lose CD45RA and gain the CD45RO isoform, which is
a marker of T cell memory.38 The percentage
of T cells that express CD45RA and CD45RO prior to stimulation (negative
control) is submitted to the intrinsic donor variability. Specifically,
they showed a low percentage of the double positive population with
a median value of 14.3%, whereas the percentage of CD45RA+ ranged from 26.5 to 67.8 (percentiles Q-25 and Q-75) with a median
of 53.6%, similar to CD45RO+ cells, which varied from 20.3
to 56.2%, but in this case, exhibited a median value of 28.6%.

(D) negative control, (E) 3D polystyrene scaffold and (F) Matrigel

by the Mann–Whitney U test (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001).

After stimulation, the median value of CD45RA+ cells
decreased to 8.9 and 7.5% in suspension and when using the 3D polystyrene
scaffold, respectively, indicating that CD4+ T cells successfully
differentiated into phenotypes other than naive. A further lower decrease
was observed for cells activated in Matrigel, which showed a percentage
of CD45RA+ cells of 33%. On the other hand, the percentage
of double positive populations increased from the 14.3% of the negative
control to 50.8% in the positive control, 41.2% in the 3D polystyrene
scaffold, and 42.2% in Matrigel. Thus, the percentage of T cells showing
both markers is significantly higher for all conditions compared to
the negative control. The CD45RO+ population remained constant
with median values of 33.7 and 41.7% in the positive control and the
3D polystyrene scaffold, respectively, whereas it was reduced to 12.5%
in Matrigel. The differences observed in the latter could be attributed
to its chemical stimulation,39 absent in
the other two platforms, which may promote the conservation of the
CD45RA phenotype. Nevertheless, this finding could also be explained
by variations of the T cell stimulation given by the specific 3D structure
and mechanical properties of Matrigel. Finally, representative dot
plots of the negative control (Figure 4D), 3D polystyrene scaffold (Figure 4E), which is similar to the one obtained
with the positive control (Figure S1),
and Matrigel (Figure 4F) are shown. In the case of the 3D polystyrene scaffold and the
positive control, the memory marker CD45RO appeared, increasing the
double positive population, and drastically reducing the CD45RA phenotype.
Nevertheless, cells expressed higher percentages of the CD45RA marker
in Matrigel, thus probably conserving the higher capacity to proliferate
of naive cells.

3 Conclusions
The
3D polystyrene scaffold significantly improved the proliferation
rates, suggesting a clear benefit for substituting standard 2D culture
systems by novel 3D platforms. Moreover, Matrigel, which has a truly
3D structure and additionally introduces a chemical input, showed
promising results with significantly higher proliferation rates than
the positive control with interesting phenotypes. However, Matrigel
suffers from a high variability, which can be explained by its natural
origin and the associated batch-to-batch variability. Thus, there
is an underexplored area of investigation to be pursued consisting
of designing 3D platforms specific for T cell culture to improve the
current T cell expansion systems to introduce new in vitro models
and facilitate the broad use of ACT in the clinics.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Matrigel
basement membrane
matrix was acquired from Corning and 3D polystyrene scaffold from
3D Biotek. The CD4+ T cell isolation kit was purchased
from Miltenyi Biotec S. L. (Germany), and the human IL-2 Quantikine
ELISA kit was obtained from R&D. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin/streptomycin
(P/S), CellTrace CFSE cell proliferation kit, and the positive control
Dynabeads were provided by Thermo Fisher Scientific. The antihuman
antibodies CD3 FITC, CD4 PE, CD69 PE, CD45RA PE, CD45RO FITC, and
their controls used for flow cytometry were acquired from Immunotools
GmbH (Germany). The rest of the products were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Instrumentation
Optical microscopy
was performed in a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E (Nikon, Japan). A BD FACSCanto
flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) was used for flow cytometry analysis.

4.3 Software
The flow cytometry data
were analyzed using the software FlowJo (FlowJo LLC), the microscope
images were treated with FiJi (ImageJ), and the graphs (the boxes
correspond to the interquartile ranges defined by the 25th and 75th
percentiles, the central line is the median, the whiskers show 1 standard
deviation, × defines 1st and 99th percentiles, – represents
the maximum and minimum, and □ is the average) and statistical
tests were performed in Origin (OriginLab Corporation).

4.4 CD4+ T Cell Purification
Primary human CD4+ T cells were obtained through a purification
process of buffy coats of healthy adult donors obtained from “Banc
de Sang i Teixits” (Barcelona, Spain) after the approval of
the “Ethics Committee on Animal and Human Experimentation”
of the Autonomous University of Barcelona (No. 3511). Briefly, peripheral
blood mononuclear cells were separated by density gradient centrifugation
using Ficoll and CD4+ T cells were further purified using
a CD4+ T cell isolation kit following the instructions
of the manufacturer. To determine their purity, cell suspensions were
prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) + 0.1% FBS and stained
with antihuman CD3 FITC, antihuman CD4 PE, and the negative controls
for 30 min at 0 °C. After washing, cells were analyzed by flow
cytometry. Only samples that were at least 90% positive for both CD3+ and CD4+ by flow cytometry (usually CD3+CD4+ T cells > 95%) were used for experiments. Viability
was constantly above 80% (usually viability > 90%).

4.5 Cell Culture and Seeding
CD4+ T cells were
seeded on 96-well plates 1 day after purification
in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) medium with 10% FBS and
1% P/S. Cells were seeded at a concentration of 106 cells/mL
and supplied with Dynabeads in a 1:1 ratio, as suggested by the manufacturer.
For Matrigel, cells were seeded with Dynabeads on top of a previously
formed hydrogel, following the manufacturer instructions, given their
capacity to penetrate and migrate through it upon activation, as previously
shown.23,24 For the 3D polystyrene scaffold, a 15 μL
drop of a concentrated cell suspension was seeded on top of the scaffold.
After 3 h at 37 °C, the medium was added. Positive controls were
done by seeding the cells in suspension, as well as negative controls,
which did not include Dynabeads.

4.6 CD4+ T Cell Activation
Cultures were evaluated 1 day
after seeding by measuring secreted
IL-2. The supernatant of the cell cultures was recovered and the IL-2
concentration was determined by ELISA following the instructions of
the manufacturer. Additionally, activation was also qualitatively
assessed through cell morphology using optical microscopy.

4.7 CD4+ T Cell Differentiation
Cultures were
tested 5–6 days after seeding by flow cytometry.
Cell suspensions were prepared in PBS + 0.1% FBS and stained with
antihuman CD45RA PE, antihuman CD45RO FITC, and the corresponding
negative controls for 30 min at 0 °C. Afterward, they were washed
and analyzed by flow cytometry.

4.8 CD4+ T Cell Proliferation
CD4+ T cells were
stained before seeding with a CFSE cell
proliferation kit. Briefly, a 1 μL of CFSE stock solution was
diluted in 99 μL of PBS + 5% FBS. Cells were diluted in PBS
up to a final volume of 900 μL and put in contact with 100 μL
of the diluted CFSE solution through rapid agitation and incubated
for 5 min at room temperature in the dark. After the incubation, 10
mL of ice cold PBS + 5% FBS were added to quench the staining. Then,
the medium was extracted and cells were resuspended in RPMI + 10%
FBS to achieve a concentration of 106 stained cells/mL.
5–6 days after seeding, cells were tested by flow cytometry.
The results obtained on day 5 (Figure 3A–C) were performed with the same set of donors,
whereas a different one was employed for the experiments of day 6
(Figure 3D–F).
