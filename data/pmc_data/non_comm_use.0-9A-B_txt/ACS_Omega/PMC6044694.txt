The demand for responsive dyes in
optical imaging is high to achieve
a better signal-to-noise ratio and, more specifically, to visualize
acidic compartments of the endocytic pathway. Herein, we present a
new synthetic route, with a step-by-step synthesis of water-soluble
pH-sensitive cyanine dyes exhibiting pKa values in the region of physiological pH, as confirmed by absorption
and fluorescence spectra. Moreover, modification of pKa values was achieved by two different substitution patterns,
creating tunable pH-sensitive dyes. We demonstrated the functionality
of the pH-sensitive dyes and their suitability as contrast agents
for cellular uptake studies by preparing dye-labeled cetuximab and
transferrin conjugates. Sulfonated head chains increased water solubility
and prevented the formation of dimers, even in the context of dye-labeled
bioconjugates. Confocal microscopy images of living cells revealed
their pH-responsiveness, as specific fluorescence signal enhancements
were observed in acidic compartments of the endocytic pathway (endosomes
and lysosomes), although the background signal was low in a pH-neutral
environment. Using mixtures of conjugates labeled with either a pH-sensitive
or non-pH-sensitive dye for the uptake studies, we could follow the
receptor binding and distinguish it from the endocytic uptake process
of the conjugates in a simultaneous manner. Moreover, we used flow
cytometry to quantify the fluorescence and observed a 3-fold signal
enhancement for the pH-sensitive dye conjugates over a period of 3
h.

Introduction
Intracellular pH has
been a focus in molecular biology studies,
as it plays an important role in many cellular processes, such as
signal transduction,1 ion transport,2 and enzyme activity,3 as well as in a cell’s lifecycle;44 for example, cell proliferation and
apoptosis is regulated by pH gradients. Moreover, abnormal pH values
can be found in diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease5 or cancer,6−9 in which extracellular pH is decreased compared to
that in healthy tissue. Furthermore, cellular uptake mechanisms such
as phagocytosis, endocytosis, and ligand–receptor complex internalization
are known pathways that involve pH decrease during uptake and intracellular
processing.10−13 Endocytosis is an active transport process that enables the uptake
of large polar molecules that are unable to pass through the cell
membrane. Compounds undergoing endocytosis are typically enclosed
in membrane vesicles of different shapes and coatings. These bodies
fuse with early endosomes, in which they are sorted and subsequently
forwarded either to cellular compartments, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi apparatus, or to late endosomes and then lysosomes
for degradation.4,14 Whereas the extracellular medium
and cytosol exhibit a neutral pH (7.4), upon endocytosis, the intravesicular
pH decreases from neutral to pH 6 in endosomes and reaches a minimum
in lysosomes (pH 5).15 In the past few
years, many substances have been investigated for their cellular uptake
characteristics. Among them is the monoclonal antibody cetuximab (ctx),
which is known to bind to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
and subsequently internalize by endocytosis.16−18 Because EGFR
is highly expressed on tumor cells, ctx has broad utility for cancer
treatment,19,20 and it was approved by the Food
and Drug Administration in 2004. However, there is still broad interest
in studying cellular uptake in more detail.

Over the past few
years, optical imaging has become a key tool
for the investigation of biological processes by the use of various
fluorophores. The application of near-infrared (NIR) dyes enables
the use of low concentrations and nonionizing radiation, which makes
them suitable for live-cell and in vivo imaging.21 However, the NIR dye indocyanine green is the only cyanine
dye that has been clinically approved.22 Yet, its application is hampered by its performance as an always-on
probe that generates a high background signal versus barely detectable
peak intensities at sites of activity. Therefore, there is a strong
demand for responsive probes that exhibit fluorescence solely where
they are active in a cell. Responsive probes are characterized by
signal amplification caused by environmental triggers, including pH
change, enzymatic modifications, or the detection of oxygen radicals.23 pH-responsive dyes specifically allow us to
follow pH changes during cellular uptake due to the modulation of
the emission spectrum upon acidification. Recently, a variety of responsive
dyes have been developed, such as carboxyfluorescein24 and boron-dipyrromethene,25,26 which are
also used for staining cell compartments, for example, LysoTracker
Green DND-26.27 Among these are polymethine
cyanine dyes, which are broadly applied because of their good photostability.
In addition, polymethine dyes exhibit a flexible structure, which
offers the opportunity to tune water solubility and spectroscopic
properties through a variety of pre- and post-synthetic modifications.
To date, only a small set of pH-sensitive cyanine dyes based on trimethines,
pentamethines, or heptamethines have been developed.28−35 CypHer5E (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) is the only commercially
available responsive cyanine dye that exhibits pKa values in the range of physiological pH. Intensive studies
revealed the pH dependence of the fluorophore and confirmed the suitability
of the sensor for in vitro and in vivo applications.36−44 However, CypHer5E has a low solubility in aqueous media and requires
the use of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for optimal solubilization. Organic
solvents are usually toxic to cells, although, depending on the cell
line, a low percentage of DMSO is still tolerated in vitro.45,46 Therefore, an unmet need exists for water-soluble dyes with pH-tunable
fluorescence. Herein, we report a tunable set of pH-sensitive cyanine
dyes incorporating three sulfonate groups to increase water solubility
and prevent aggregation. Furthermore, a carboxy functionality enables
conjugation to carriers or target molecules. Because of an additional
benzene moiety, a bathochromic shift allows for optimized fluorescence
imaging of living cells close to the optical window. Moreover, we
prepared pH-sensitive dyes with different pKa values by modifying the meso-position of the conjugated polymethine
chain. Applying qualitative and quantitative measurements through
confocal laser scanning microscopy (cLSM) images and flow cytometry,
we characterized the novel pH-sensitive dyes as fluorescent labels
that are highly suitable to monitor cellular binding and study uptake processes
(Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
Dye Synthesis
We synthesized a new set of water-soluble
pentamethine dyes that consist of sulfonated benzindolenine 1 and unalkylated or methylated carboxy indolenine precursors.
The synthesis was carried out using 2-chloromalondianil 2 and 3-anilinoacrolein anil 3 to afford chloro-substituted
derivatives 6 and 7 and nonsubstituted dyes 8 and 9, respectively. Fluorophores 7 and 9 form a pair of non-pH-sensitive dyes that are
structurally similar to the pH-dependent dyes but insensitive to pH
changes due to the methyl-blocked nitrogen atom. Through the introduction
of an additional benzene moiety using benzindolenine 1 as a precursor in the cyanine synthesis, a bathochromic shift of
nearly 20 nm compared to CypHer5E was achieved, allowing for optimized
optical imaging. The benzindolenine precursor is also equipped with
three sulfonic acid groups, yielding highly hydrophilic fluorophores
due to negative charges that are known to prevent dimerization. Furthermore,
functionalizing the other indolenine enables conjugation of the dyes
to targeting moieties, for example, biomolecules.

The first
step of the synthesis was carried out in a microwave system using
the less-reactive sulfonated benzindoleine, 1, and acroleine
derivative 2 or 3 dissolved in acetic acid
to form an intermediate, which was separated from the unreacted starting
material by precipitation in diethyl ether. Chromatographic purification
could not be performed because of fast decomposition on silica gel.
In the next step, unalkylated 4 or methylated carboxy
indolenine 5 was added along with sodium acetate, and
the reaction was carried out in methanol at 90 °C overnight (see Scheme 1). After purification
by reversed phase (RP) high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
the hydrophilic pentamethine dyes were obtained in yields ranging
from 7 to 42%, and the purity was confirmed by NMR and analytical
HPLC (see the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S10). Moreover, we designed four chromophores
based on a benzindole moiety providing three sulfate groups, enabling
similar degrees of hydrophilicity, as proven by HPLC retention in
comparison to that for CypHer5E (see Figures S7–S11).

(NHS) Esters 10–13

°C, 2 h; (2) sodium acetate, methanol, 90 °C, overnight.

For cellular uptake studies, the newly synthesized
fluorophores
were conjugated to biomolecules to follow the emission signal and
evaluate the new dyes as pH sensors in vitro. As model molecules,
we chose the iron-binding plasma protein transferrin (tf) and ctx,
a monoclonal IgG antibody. Both ligand molecules are known to enter
the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. In contrast to tf, which
is recycled and transported back to the extracellular environment
after release of bound iron in early endosomes, ctx binds to the EGF
receptor and ends up in lysosomes.4,47,48 Therefore, lysosomal accumulation of ctx dye conjugates
should lead to an increase in the fluorescent signal. For bioconjugation,
the carboxy functionalities of dyes 6–9 were converted into the more reactive NHS esters using HSTU or dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC)/NHS, yielding the respective esters (10–13) in 64–99% yield. Subsequently, the NHS esters were
reacted with tf or ctx overnight in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
(pH = 7.4), without the requirement of any organic co-solvents, and
yielded conjugates with similar dye-to-protein (D/P) ratios, ranging
from 0.7 to 1.4 (see Table 1). In addition to the newly synthesized fluorophores, we also
prepared conjugates with indocarbocyanine (ICC)49 for spectroscopic comparison. The absence of free dye in
ctx conjugates as well as covalent coupling of the dyes to the heavy
and light chains of ctx was confirmed by gel electrophoresis. Moreover,
surface plasmon resonance (SPR) measurements revealed retained functionality
upon labeling. EGF receptor recognition of ctx and the dye conjugates
gave comparable affinity constants (see Figures S14–S16 and Table S1).

Spectroscopic Characterization
The newly synthesized
dyes showed excellent water solubility and therefore the spectroscopic
characterization could be performed in aqueous media, which is required
for the evaluation of pH dependency. Absorption and fluorescence spectra
were recorded in different phosphate buffer solutions, ranging in
pH from 5.0 to 10.0 (shown in Figure 2). In buffer solution (pH = 5.5–6.0), pH-sensitive
dyes 6 and 8 reveal absorption maxima at
662 nm, which decrease with rising pH. A remarkable drop to 30% fluorescence
intensity between pH’s 5.0 and 7.5 is obvious, and coincidentally,
a new peak at 520 nm arises at pH > 6.0, originating from the nonfluorescent
base form. Although chloro-substituted dye 8 shows similar
results to dye 6, the absorption maximum of the protonated
form was detected up to pH 7.5, whereas that of the base form is detectable
from pH 7.0 onwards. We observed a decrease in fluorescence intensity
up to pH 8.0. The pH dependency of dyes conjugated to ctx or tf revealed
a similar peak pattern as that for free dyes, which is illustrated
in the Supporting Information (see Figure S12). Additionally, aggregation was not observed for free dyes, and
only minimal dimerization was detected in bioconjugates. By comparing
fluorescence maxima at different pH values, we determined pKa values of 7.1 and 7.8 for dyes 6 and 8, respectively (see Figure 2c,d), from fluorescence spectra, whereas
absorption spectra revealed pKa values
of 6.9 and 7.5 (see Figure S13). These
values are similar to the pKa of 7.3 that
was reported for CypHer5E by GE Healthcare Life Sciences. Moreover,
the pKa of the newly synthesized chloro-derivative 6 even falls below the value for CypHer5E. To conclude, the
pH dependency was influenced by different residues at the meso-position
of the conjugated chain, as the chloro atom in dye 6 most
likely withdraws electron density from the conjugated system. In contrast,
non-pH-sensitive dyes 7 and 9 revealed constant
absorption maxima in buffer solutions.

and 8 (b) in phosphate buffer solution. Graphs (c) and
(d) show the pH dependence of the fluorescence maxima at 684 and 685
nm of dyes 6 and 8, respectively. pKa values displayed in graphs (c) and (d) were
determined by a fitting curve from triplicate measurements.

Spectroscopic data of dyes 6–9 are summarized in Table 1 and are in good accordance
with those for known pentamethine
dyes,50−52 revealing molar absorption coefficients of ∼140 000
for pH-sensitive dyes 6 and 8 and larger
coefficients for non-pH-sensitive dyes 7 and 9. Fluorescence quantum yields are also comparable to those of other
pentamethine dyes, whereas chloro-substituted dyes 6 and 7 exhibit lower Φf values (0.12) than those
of nonsubstituted dyes 8 and 9, for which
we determined Φf to be ∼0.23. The substitution
of the polymethine chain influences Φf, leading to
a decrease when an electron-withdrawing group is introduced, which
was also observed by Mader et al.51 Moreover,
each pH-sensitive dye reveals the same Φf as that
of its structurally similar reference dye. Additionally, all dyes
reveal bathochromic-shifted absorption maxima at 662 nm, caused by
the additional benzene ring on the indolenine moiety.

Cellular Uptake
Studies
Biological evaluation of the
new fluorophores was conducted by cellular uptake studies using cLSM
and flow cytometry. tf and ctx are prominent molecules referenced
in the literature due to their well-known cellular uptake pathways
via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Moreover, ctx binds to the EGFR,
which is highly expressed on the A431 epidermoid cancer cell line,
whereas low-EGFR-expressing A549 lung cancer cells can be used as
the control cell line. In theory, dye-labeled conjugates are internalized
after receptor binding, and pH-sensitive dyes are supposed to reveal
an enhanced emission signal during intracellular processing in endosomes
and lysosomes. tf is known to be shuttled back to the neutral extracellular
environment after iron release due to acidification in the early endosomes.48 In contrast, EGFR-binding proteins, such as
ctx, accumulate in lysosomes.47 Therefore,
cells incubated with ctx conjugates labeled with pH-sensitive dyes
should show an intracellular increase in the fluorescence signal over
time. In contrast, no signal enhancement is expected for pH-sensitive
tf conjugates. In the present study, cLSM was used to image living
(nonfixed) cells because pH changes might occur during cell fixation.
In all experiments, we used concentrations of 1 μM on the basis
of the dye’s absorption maximum, and because of similar D/P
ratios, they were even comparable to the ctx or tf concentration (see Table 1). A431 cells were
incubated with dye-labeled tf and ctx conjugates for 2.5 and 4.5 h,
respectively, without a washing step. As shown in Figure 3, conjugates 10–ctx (a) and 12–ctx (f), which contain pH-sensitive dyes, revealed a very low background
signal, which is in the range of autofluorescence of cells, but strong
emission was observed inside acidic cellular compartments. Comparing
both pH-sensitive dyes, the nonsubstituted derivative, 12–ctx, revealed a slightly higher background signal,
which can be associated with the increased pKa value of the respective free dye, 8. In contrast,
the non-pH-sensitive dye-labeled conjugates, 11–ctx (b) and 13–ctx (g), revealed a strong background
signal as well as accumulation inside cellular compartments, whereas
conjugate 13–ctx shows enhanced fluorescence
intensity, most likely due to the higher Φf of the
corresponding free dye, 9. Moreover, all dye-labeled
ctx conjugates show the characteristic cytoplasmic membrane staining
of EGFR on A431 cells before internalization, with the exception of
pH-sensitive dye conjugate 10–ctx, due to the smaller pKa value of the
respective free dye, 6, which is caused by the chloro
atom in the conjugated chain. Accordingly, conjugate 10–ctx is more selective for intracellular detection
in acidic vesicles and exhibits only a low background signal under
physiological conditions. Even though fluorescence is still present
at physiological pH, as we reported in the fluorescence spectra of
the free dyes (see Figure 2a,b), we could observe only a very weak signal, which was
below the detection limit of the microscope. In our experiments, the
lasers were set to allow sensitive detection above autofluorescence
of cells and therefore the background signal is negligible, particularly
when compared to that of reference dyes. Images of tf conjugates showed
similar results and are displayed in Figures S18 and S19); in addition, images obtained for A549 cells incubated
with tf and ctx conjugates are shown in Figures S21 and S22.

Figure 3 Live-cell images of A431 cells incubated for 4.5 h with
conjugates 10–ctx (a), 11–ctx (b), 12–ctx (f), and 13–ctx (g). Images (c)–(e)
and
(h)–(j) show living cells incubated with previously mixed conjugates
consisting of ICC–tf ((d) or (i))
and 10–tf (c) or 12–tf (h) containing pH-sensitive dyes. Images (d) and (i) represent
channels for ICC–ctx, whereas (e)
and (j) show the overlay of both channels. Scale bars equal 30 μm.

To further strengthen our results,
we utilized ICC-labeled conjugates ICC–tf and ICC–ctx, which are insensitive
to pH changes and additionally
enabled simultaneous measurements of both dyes in equal environments
due to a blue-shifted emission in the Cy3 spectral range, with negligible
crosstalk to the spectral range of the pH-sensitive dyes. Prior to
incubation, conjugate ICC–ctx was
mixed with conjugate 10–ctx or 12–ctx, containing pH-sensitive dyes,
and the cellular uptake was followed by cLSM of living cells. After
4.5 h, an accumulated signal was observed inside the cells for the
ICC channel (see Figure 3d,e) and for red-shifted pH-sensitive dye conjugates 10–ctx (3c) and 12–ctx (3h). Whereas the pH-sensitive dyes revealed a weak signal in extracellular
medium, the ICC conjugates showed strong background signals as well
as characteristic receptor binding on membranes. Moreover, overlaid
channels revealed co-localization inside the cells. Furthermore, we
also incubated the cells with LysoTracker Green DND-26, which stains
acidic compartments inside the cells. For all conjugates, we could
see a good correlation among the dyes (see Figure S20).

For quantitative assessment of the new fluorophores,
we also used
flow cytometry and investigated the amount of fluorescent cells. Because
of the rapid cellular uptake of tf and its fast recycling back to
the cell surface,4,48 no signal increase could be observed
(see Figure S17). Therefore, further studies
were conducted with ctx conjugates. EGFR-positive A431 cells were
incubated with ctx conjugates for 10 min, followed by a washing step.
Fluorescence of the cells was analyzed over a period of 8 h and normalized
to the starting point (0 h after the washing step) to follow the signal
enhancement caused by cellular uptake in a comparable manner. Figure 4e,f illustrates a
strong increase in the fluorescence intensity up to 3 h for pH-sensitive
conjugates and a signal decrease after 5 h, whereas the non-pH-sensitive
dyes revealed a nearly constant signal. Whereas nonsubstituted dye
conjugate 12–ctx exhibited a 2.5-fold
signal increase, Cl-substituted dye conjugate 10–ctx demonstrated a 3.5-fold signal enhancement. These results
are consistent with our previous observations and underline the potential
of chloro-substituted pH-sensitive dye 6 in cellular
uptake studies, given its lower pKa value
of 7.1 compared to that of nonsubstituted dye 8. To interpret
the results obtained from flow cytometry analysis, we followed the
cellular uptake of ctx conjugates over a period of 8 h by cLSM of
living cells. The procedure was similar to flow cytometry measurements
and included a washing step after 10 min of incubation. Figure 4 shows the time-resolved cellular
uptake of conjugates 10–ctx (a), 11–ctx (b), 12–ctx (c), and 13–ctx (d).
A strong signal enhancement inside the cells is observed at 3 h and
maintained up to 8 h, strengthening the results from flow cytometry
analysis. Moreover, characteristic membrane EGFR binding was observed
for all conjugates, with the exception of pH-sensitive dye conjugate 10–ctx, which exhibits the lowest background
signal at physiological pH. In contrast, membrane binding was observed
up to 8 h for non-pH-sensitive dyes and contributes to the emission
signal that was detected by flow cytometry and therefore has to be
considered for the interpretation of quantitative results. Only the
pH-sensitive conjugate 10–ctx produced
fluorescence, mostly from inside the cell. These findings are supported
by accompanying spectroscopic studies of nonconjugated pH-sensitive
dye 6, with a pKa value of
7.1, that can be used for monitoring cellular uptake without exhibiting
strong fluorescence emission in the cell medium. In contrast, pH-sensitive
dye 8 revealed a higher pKa value and therefore in the context of conjugate 12–ctx demonstrates fluorescence emission at the cell membrane,
while showing a low background signal in cell culture medium.

Conclusions
In summary, we successfully provided a
new synthetic route to new
pH-sensitive cyanine dyes and also structurally similar reference
dyes. For the first time, we describe a step-by-step synthesis of
CypHer5E analogues with similar structural patterns. Moreover, we synthesized
dyes with different substitution patterns at the meso-position of
the conjugated chain, bearing a Cl or H atom, therefore resulting
in a tunable pH dependence. The incorporation of three sulfonate groups
resulted in excellent water solubility and low aggregation in aqueous
solution. Successful functionalization with reactive NHS esters and
subsequent conjugation to the biomolecules tf and ctx was conducted.
pKa values of 7.1 fell below the value
for CypHer5E, whereas similar polarities were achieved. Additionally,
the pH-sensitivity was not
only confirmed by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy but the
sensor properties were also evaluated by labeling of living cells.
Flow cytometry measurements revealed an approximately 3-fold increase
in the emission signal after a 3 h incubation and a decrease in the
signal at 8 h. We also confirmed that the emission signal inside living
cells can be tracked over time using confocal microscopy. In doing
so, we showed that receptor-mediated binding and uptake can be visualized
precisely as a fluorophore converts from low fluorescence emission
at physiological pH to stronger emission in acidic compartments. Hence,
our results demonstrate how the chemistry of pH-sensitive cyanine
dyes can be used to customize sensor properties using well-chosen
structural substitution patterns and therefore allow, for the first
time, insights into rational design of pH properties. Such dyes can
be applied as contrast agents for various applications, for example,
monitoring cellular uptake, as pKa value
differences can be used to accentuate membrane binding and suppress
background in the cell culture medium.

Methods
Synthesis
All solvents and chemicals were commercially
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, VWR, Merck, and Acros Organics and used
as received, unless otherwise stated. HSTU was bought from Carbolution,
and compound 1 was purchased from Syntharo Fine Chemicals
GmbH. 2-Chloromalondianil 2 and anilinoacrolein anil 3 were acquired from Organica. Indolenines 4 and 5 and ICC NHS were provided by Epiios Therapeutics GmbH. LysoTracker
Green DND-26 was bought from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Erbitux was
purchased from Merck Serono, and ctx was isolated by ultracentrifugation
and lyophilization. Synthesized pentamethine dyes were purified by
preparative HPLC on a high-pressure gradient system (stainless steel),
equipped with dual Shimadzu LC-8A pumps, a Shimadzu CBM-20A controller,
a variable wavelength UV detector from Knauer, and a Rheodyne injector
with a 10 mL sample loop. The stationary phase was a prepacked RP-18
column (RSC-Gel, 5 μm, 20 × 250 mm2) from RSC.
HPLC runs were performed with a total flow rate of 20 mL min–1, applying a gradient from 10 to 100% MeOH, with UV detection at
650 nm. Pure dyes were dried on a Virtis Benchtop K 20 K XL, and the
purification of biomolecule conjugates was conducted on Sephadex columns
(NAP-25, Sephadex G-25 DNA) with PBS as a solvent. Sensitive substances
were shaken on
BioShake iQ, and centrifugation was conducted on Universal 32 from
Hettich. All samples were weighed on Precisa XB120A, and for thin-layer
chromatography (TLC), silica gel 60 RP-18 F254S plates
were used for RP analysis. 1H NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Avance III spectrometer (700 MHz), and mass spectra were
obtained via electrospray on an Agilent 6210 ESI-TOF spectrometer.

Absorption and Fluorescence Measurements
Samples for
absorption and fluorescence measurements were dissolved in Millipore
water or PBS solution (3 mM KCl, 140 mM NaCl, 0.01 M Na2HPO4·7H2O in 500 mL distilled water) or
previously prepared phosphate buffers (67 mM, containing Na2HPO4·2H2O and KH2PO4 in distilled water). All absorption spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer
LAMBDA 950 UV/vis/NIR spectrometer, using disposable cuvettes from
Brand, and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Quantamaster 400
fluorometer. Absolute fluorescence quantum yields were calculated
from previously recorded fluorescence spectra using a Fluorolog 3
fluorometer (Horiba Jobin Yvon) with an integrating sphere (80 mm
diameter, handmade). The light intensity was reduced by a neutral
density filter (10% transmission). Slit widths were set to 2.5 nm
(excitation) and 1 nm (emission). All samples were excited at 640
nm, and the integration time was set to 2 s. For the determination
of Φf, the integrated fluorescence values of the
sample and solvent were determined to achieve the number of photons
emitted (645–840 nm, step size: 2 nm) and absorbed (636–644
nm, step size: 0.2 nm).

Synthesis of Dye Labels

A mixture of 1-(4-sulfonatobutyl)5,7-disulfo-TMBI sodium
salt (0.182 mmol), acroleine 2 or 3 (0.218
mmol), and 1 mL of acetic acid was added to a 0.5–2 mL reaction
vial and heated in a microwave system to 110 °C for 2 h. The
solution was concentrated in vacuum, precipitated in ethyl ether,
and centrifuged. To the residue, indolenine 4 or 5 (0.273 or 1.092 mmol), sodium acetate (0.546 mmol) and 5
mL of methanol were added, and the mixture was heated to 90 °C
overnight. The dye was precipitated in diethyl ether and centrifuged,

Preparation
of NHS Esters 10–14
A solution of dye 6 (15 mg, 0.018 mmol), HSTU (9.7 mg,
0.027 mmol), and DIPEA (3.5 mg, 4–6 μmol, 0.027 mmol)
in DMF (555 μL) was stirred at room temperature (rt) for 1 day.
The dye was precipitated in diethyl ether and centrifuged. The residue
was dried in vacuum, and product 10 was afforded as a
blue solid (11.9 mg, 72%): MS m/z 896.1011 (C38H36ClN3NaO13S3– calcd 896.1002).

Dye 7 (15
mg, 0.018 mmol) was reacted according to the above-described procedure
to obtain 16.7 mg (99%) of dye 11: MS m/z 910.1097 (C39H38ClN3NaO13S3– calcd 910.1158).

A mixture
of dye 8 (15 mg, 0.019 mmol), DCC (11.8
mg, 0.057 mmol), and NHS (6.6 mg, 0.057 mmol) in DMF (555 μL)
was stirred at rt for 1 day. After precipitation with diethyl ether
and centrifugation, dye 12 (16.7 mg, 99%) was afforded
as a blue solid: MS m/z 862.1380 (C38H37N3NaO13S3– calcd 862.1392).

Dye 9 (5.3 mg, 0.007 mmol) was
reacted according to
the previously described procedure to afford 3.8 mg (64%) of dye 13: MS m/z 922.1353 (C39H39N3Na3O13S3+ calcd
922.1333).

Preparation of Bioconjugates
To
a solution of holo–tf
or ctx (6.7 μM) in PBS (pH 7.4) was added the NHS ester (10–13 or ICC) from a stock solution of
the respective dye in PBS (1–3 mg mL–1),
using a molar excess of the reactive dye (2–5 molecular equiv).
The reaction mixture was gently shaken overnight at rt, and purification
was performed with Sephadex columns (NAP25; Amersham) and PBS as the
eluent. TLC (RP-C18) was used to confirm the absence of unbound dye.
The D/P ratios of dye–tf conjugates and dye–ctx conjugates
were calculated using the absorption maximum method.53,54 Protein concentrations were calculated by measuring the absorbance
at 280 nm using extinction coefficients estimated by the Expasy Protparam
tool for ctx, and a molar absorption coefficient of 87 000
L  mol–1 cm–1 was
used for tf.55 The purity of antibody conjugates
and coupling to ctx were analyzed under nonreducing and reducing conditions
using 13% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis visualized by coomassie
staining and recording the fluorescence signal on VersaDoc 4000 MP
(BioRad, Munich, Germany; setup for Cy3 detection: illumination with
green LED, filter: 605 nm bandpass; Cy5 detection: illumination with
red LED, filter: 695 nm bandpass). The PageRuler Prestained Protein
Ladder (10–180 kDa) was purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific.

SPR Binding Studies
Experiments were carried out on
a Biacore X100 device (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany). A carboxymethylated
dextran chip (CM5-Chip; GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) was fully
coupled on Fc2 with EGFR Fc-chimera (R&D Systems, Wiesbaden-Nordenstadt,
Germany), using the amine coupling strategy (EDC/NHS), HBS-EP (10
mM HEPES, pH 7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 3 mM EDTA; and 0.005% v/v surfactant
P20) as a running buffer, and acetate (pH 4.5) as a sample buffer
for the ligand. The response level reached ∼5500 RU for Fc2.
Bevacizumab (Avastin; Roche/Genentech) was coupled as a nonbinding
control to Fc1, reaching ∼27 000 RU. Affinities were
measured using a
kinetic titration series (single-cycle kinetics) at 25 °C, in
which five ascending concentrations of conjugates 19–23 were injected consecutively for 120 s at 30 μL min–1, followed by a dissociation time of 600 s and two
short pulses of 20 s 10 mM glycin HCl pH 2.5 to regenerate the sensor
surface. Therefore,
the conjugates (19–23) were diluted
in running buffer (HBS-EP) at concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, 1,
and 0.1 nM, respectively. The signal of the Bevacizumab-treated flow
cell was subtracted from the binding signal. Additionally, blank injects
of running buffer only were also subtracted (double referencing) for
each run. Measurements were performed in triplicate. Sensorgrams were
analyzed by plotting the analyte concentration against the binding
signal at the end of injection. The resulting isotherm was fitted
to obtain the KD values using the steady
state model.

Cell Studies
For cLSM, epithelial
human cancer cell
line A431 (DSMZ No. ACC 91) and human lung carcinoma epithelial cell
line A549 (DSMZ No. ACC 107) were routinely propagated in DMEM medium
with 2% glutamine (Gibco BRL, Eggenstein, Germany), penicillin/streptomycin
(Gibco BRL), and 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom AG, Berlin, Germany)
at 37 °C with 5% CO2 and subcultured twice a week.
For confocal microscopy,
27 000 cells were seeded in each well of a μ-Slides 8
Well (ibidi GmbH, Martinsried, Germany) and cultured at 37 °C
for 24 h. Thereafter, dye-labeled test substances were added to the
cells at a final concentration of 1 μM. Confocal images were
taken with an inverted confocal laser scanning microscope, Leica DMI6000CSB
SP8 (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany), with a 63×/1.4 HC PL APO CS2 oil
immersion objective, at 37 °C, using the LAS X software provided
by the manufacturer. Images of different groups were acquired with
the same laser and detector settings, using the Leica LAS AF software.
Fluorescence detection was performed sequentially for each channel
set with the acousto-optical beam splitter between 570 and 648 nm
for the ICC dye and between 650 and 749 nm for the pentamethine dyes.
ICC was excited using the 561 nm diode-pumped solid-state laser line,
whereas the pentamethine dyes were excited with a 633 nm HeNe laser.
For flow cytometric analysis, the A431 cell line was used and routinely
propagated as described. The cells (100 000 cells per well)
were cultured in 24-well-plates at 37 °C for 24 h. Thereafter,
test substances were added for 10 min at a final concentration of
1 μM. After 10 min of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was
removed and the cells were washed three times with PBS. For postincubation
times, colorless cell culture medium was added and the cells were
incubated at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, 3, 5, and 8 h. Afterwards, the
cells were detached by trypsin, transferred to an Eppendorf tube,
and centrifuged at 140g and 4 °C for 4 min.
The fluorescence of the cells was measured on BD Accuri C6 (Becton
Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), and analysis was carried out using
the BD Accuri C6 Software.
