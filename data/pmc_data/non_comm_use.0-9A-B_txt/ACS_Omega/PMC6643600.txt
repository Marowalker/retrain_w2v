Electrospinning
of polymers typically requires high solution concentrations
necessitated by the requirement of sufficient chain overlaps to achieve
the required viscoelastic properties. Here, we report on a novel supramolecular
approach, involving polymer/surfactant complexes, which allows for
a significant reduction in the solution concentration of polymer for
electrospinning. The approach involved supramolecular complexation
of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) with a surfactant, dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (DBSA), via ionic interactions. The supramolecular complexation
of P4VP with DBSA led to a significant increase in the solution viscosity
even at a DBSA/4VP molar ratio as low as 0.05. Furthermore, the solution
viscosity of the P4VP/DBSA complex increased significantly with the
DBSA/4VP molar ratio. The increase in the viscosity for the P4VP/DBSA
complexes was plausibly due to the formation of physical cross-links
between P4VP chains driven by hydrophobic interactions between the
surfactant tails. The formation of such physical cross-links led to
a significant decrease in the solution concentration needed for the
onset of semidilute entangled regime. Thus, the P4VP/DBSA complexes
could be electrospun at a much lower concentration. The critical solution
concentration to obtain bead-free uniform nanofibers of P4VP/DBSA
complexes in dimethylformamide was reduced to 12% (w/v), which was
not possible for neat P4VP solution even up to approximately 35% (w/v).
Furthermore, small-angle X-ray scattering and polarized optical microscopy
results revealed that the electrospun nanofibers of P4VP/DBSA complexes
self-assembled in lamellar mesomorphic structures similar to that
observed in bulk. However, the electrospun nanofibers exhibited significantly
improved lamellar order, which was plausibly facilitated by the preferred
orientation of P4VP chains along the fiber axis.

Introduction
Electrospinning is
a relatively simple and versatile method to
produce fibrous materials in the nano- and micrometer dimensions.1−3 In a typical electrospinning process, a polymer solution or melt
is ejected from a small nozzle under the influence of a strong electric
field. The buildup of electrostatic charges on the surface of a liquid
droplet induces the formation of a jet, which is subsequently stretched
to form a continuous ultrathin fiber.4 The
electrospun nanofibers possess remarkable features, such as desirable
fiber length, well-controlled diameter, and large surface area-to-volume
ratio. As a result, the electrospun nanofibers have potential applications
in many fields, including reinforced composites, tissue engineering,
drug delivery, filtration industry, supports for enzymes and catalysts,
sensing materials, optoelectronic devices, etc.5−8 Solution properties (viz. viscosity,
conductivity, surface tension) and process parameters (viz. applied
voltage, tip-to-collector distance, and flow rate) are the two major
groups of factors that govern the morphology and mechanical properties
of electrospun fibers.8,9 The past studies have shown that
one of the most important factors influencing the formation of continuous
electrospun fibers is the formation of effective topological entanglements
between polymer chains in the solution. The entanglements between
polymer chains act as physical cross-links, which resist the deformation
imposed by the electrostatic stretching forces during electrospinning
and, hence, maintain the chain connectivity crucial for the formation
of continuous fibers. Hence, the molecular weight of the polymer and
solution concentration play an important role in governing the elctrospinnability
of the polymers. Increasing either or both of them results in an effective
increase in the entanglement density of the chains in solution, which
has been used as one of the most effective tools for making the polymer
electrospinnable. The fundamental studies done on the electrospinning
process have shown that for a polymer solution to be electrospinnable,
the polymer molecular weight and solution concentration need to be
well above the critical molecular weight for entanglement (Me) and critical solution concentration for onset
of semidilute entangled regime (Ce), respectively,
to facilitate sufficient topological constraints in solution during
electrospinning.10−15

The requirement of either high molecular weight or high solution
concentration, however, limits the applicability of electrospinning
as a general tool for the spinning of polymer nanofibers especially
for the case of polymers such as polyelectrolytes, biopolymers, or
rigid polymers, which do not entangle easily. Hence, several strategies
have been used in the past to improve the electrospinnability of such
polymers. The most common approach has been to blend the nonelectrospinnable
polymer with a secondary electrospinnable polymer for improving adequate
entanglements.16−18 The entanglement density could also be increased
by tuning the chain conformation in solution.19−21 Khan et al.
showed that alginate, having a rigid conformation in water, could
be made electrospinnable by the use of glycerol as a polar co-solvent.
The use of glycerol as a co-solvent was shown to increase the chain
flexibility and, hence, effective chain entanglements between the
polymer chains.19 Similarly, Pellerin et
al. showed that poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) chain conformation, in
dimethylformamide (DMF), could be tuned by adding a poor nonsolvent
such as nitromethane. In this case, the presence of nonsolvent induces
chain coiling, which was responsible for increase in chain entanglements
and hence improved electrospinnability.20 Georgiadou et al. also found that electrospinnability of polylactides
could be improved by taking a combination of good solvent (acetone)
and poor solvent (DMF). The reduction of surface tension of polymer
solutions has also been found to improve electrospinnability. In this
case, either a combination of solvents of low and high surface tensions
could be used or a surface active agent could be added in the polymer
solution to reduce the droplet formation during electrospinning.21

Recently, supramolecular interactions
such as hydrogen-bonding,
ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions have also been used
to decrease the overlap concentration for polymer solutions to improve
the polymer elctrospinnability.18,22−25 The supramolecular interactions basically produce physical cross-links
between polymer chains such that the entanglement density increases
leading to electrospinnability at lower solution concentrations. Pellerin
and co-workers used bifunctional small organic molecules and divalent
metal ions to produce physical cross-links between polymer chains
via hydrogen-bonding or coordination interactions. They demonstrated
that the solution concentration for spinning poly(4-vinylpyridine)
(P4VP) in DMF could be reduced by a factor of two using their approach.20,23 Similarly, Khan and co-workers used a polymeric additive having
long pendant hydrophobic groups to reduce the electrospunnable concentration
of poly(ethylene oxide).18,22

In addition to
the above, few works have been reported in the past
showing that even small molecules could also be electrospun without
the addition of polymer, proving that supramolecular interactions
could be strong enough to allow electrospinning without breaking of
the electrospun jet. For example, electrospinning of nonpolymeric
species like phospholipids, gemini surfactant, cyclodextrins, small
peptide, and recently tannic acid has been demonstrated, which involved
supramolecular interactions.26−31

The use of supramolecular interactions, apart from improving
polymer
electrospinnability, potentially could also be used to develop nanostructured
and functional nanofibers. Such an approach has been used extensively
in the past to prepare bulk materials or thin films having ordered
and hierarchical nanostructures.32,33 In this case,
amphiphilic molecules with long alkyl tails such as dodecylbenzenesulfonic
acid (DBSA) or pentadecylphenol were used to form supramolecular complexes
with polymers such as P4VP, resulting in the formation of comb polymers.
These so-called comb polymers exhibit interesting properties and could
be used to impart functionalities to the otherwise nonfunctional polymers.
One of the interesting aspects of such comblike supramolecular polymers
is that they can undergo microphase separation to form well-ordered
nanostructures at room temperature. The self-organization of the supramolecular
complexes in this case is basically driven by a balance between the
attractive and repulsive interactions between the polymer and surfactant.34−36 Such supramolecular comblike polymers have several potentially interesting
applications in optoelectronics, molecular electronics, photonic band
gap materials, porous materials for filtration, and controlled release
and absorption.37−40

In the present work, we demonstrate that the supramolecular
binding
of an amphiphilic molecule, i.e., DBSA could be used as a novel method
to enhance interchain interactions in stiff polymers such as P4VP
via hydrophobic interactions. It will be shown that the supramolecular
approach adopted in the present study enabled the reduction in solution
concentration, for effective electrospinning of P4VP, by a factor
of more than 2. The improved electrospinnability could be achieved
even at a DBSA/4VP molar ratio as low as 0.05. The improved electrospinnability
was further corroborated using rheological measurements, which demonstrated
a significant increase in solution viscosity as well as the elasticity
after supramolecular complexation. Furthermore, the electrospun nanofibers
prepared from P4VP/DBSA comb polymers self-assembled in lamellar mesomorphic
structures with improved order compared to that in bulk.

Results and Discussion
Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Study of P4VP(DBSA)x Complexes
The interaction between
P4VP and DBSA during complex formation involves the protonation of
pyridinic nitrogen of P4VP by the acidic sulfonic groups (−SO3H) and the subsequent association of the positive pyridinium
ions and the negative sulfonate ions (−SO3–). This ionic association between the two is shown in Figure 1a.

Figure 1 (a) General molecular
structure of the ionic complexation between
P4VP and DBSA. Infrared spectra for DBSA, P4VP(DBSA)x (x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00),
and neat P4VP in regions (b) 900–1100 cm–1 and (c) 1500–1800 cm–1.

The chemical association of DBSA molecules to P4VP
was ascertained
by FTIR, as shown in Figure 1b,c. As per the past studies on similar complexes, the most
affected bands of P4VP are the stretching bands at 1597, 1570, and
993 cm–1.32,41,42Figure 1b,c shows
the spectrum of P4VP(DBSA)x complexes
with x = 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 1.00 as
well as neat P4VP. Figure 1b,c represents the detailed spectrum insight of P4VP(DBSA)
complexes and neat P4VP, in ranges of 900–1100 and 1500–1800
cm–1, respectively. Figure 1b depicts that the pure P4VP absorption band
at 993 cm–1 vanished on complete protonation and
gets replaced by two new bands of almost similar strength at 1008
and 1033 cm–1. Figure 1c demonstrates the characteristic band of
pure P4VP at 1570 and 1597 cm–1 due to the pyridine
ring stretching. On protonation, the bands are replaced by an extra
band at 1637 cm–1, which can be attributed to the
hydrogen-bonded pyridinium ring. On complete protonation, the band
at 1570 cm–1 fully vanished and the band at 1637
cm–1 gains maximum intensity. Thus, the FTIR spectrum
attested the successful complexation of DBSA with P4VP.

Solution Properties
Conductivity
Solution conductivity is a crucial parameter
in the process of electrospinning as the viscoelastic solution undergoes
deformation due to the repulsion of charges present on spinning jet
surface to produce fibers with reduced diameters. Hence, the conductivities
of neat P4VP and P4VP(DBSA)x complex solutions
were measured to evaluate the influence of surfactant added to the
solution. The conductivity of the DMF, used in this work, was also
measured for a systematic comparison of all of the prepared solutions. Figure 2 shows the conductivities
of neat P4VP and P4VP(DBSA)x complex solutions
at different molar ratios. The conductivity measurements were done
at 1% (w/v) of P4VP in DMF. The conductivity showed significant increase
after the addition of DBSA and was found to increase with increase
in the molar ratio, x. The conductivity increased
from 3.1 μS/cm, for P4VP solution without DBSA, to 336 μS/cm,
when the DBSA/4VP molar ratio was 1. This significant increase in
the conductivity mostly was due to the ionic interaction between the
pyridinic nitrogen of P4VP and sulfonate head of DBSA, as shown in Figure 1a. The increase in
the solution conductivities were expected to favor the electrospinning
process. In this case, the increase in the accumulated charge density
on the spinning jet would facilitate the stretching of the viscous
jet and should yield fibers with reduced diameter. However, as will
be shown later, at increased content of DBSA in the solution, the
fiber diameters were found to increase, which suggested that conductivity
was not the primary reason for the improvement in electrospinnability
as reported in this work and that the viscoelastic properties of the
solution had more significant impact.

molar ratio at 1 wt % P4VP.

Surface Tension
It is well known that fiber formation
in electrospinning process is facilitated by lower surface tension
of the solution. In the present study, the solvent used, i.e., DMF,
had a surface tension of 37 mN/m. As shown in Figure 3, the addition of P4VP in DMF had a negligible
influence on the surface tension. The addition of DBSA, which is a
surfactant, was expected to lower the surface tension especially at
a very high content of DBSA. As shown in the figure, the complexation
of P4VP with DBSA does result in some decrease in the surface tension.
However, the decrease was very small up to the DBSA/4VP molar ratio
of 0.25. A further increase in the molar ratio resulted in a slight
decrease in the surface tension of the solution. The surface tension
data showed that the change in surface tension of the solution, on
addition of DBSA, was not significant enough to be considered as the
primary factor influencing the electrospinnability of the solution.

Rheological Results
The rheological studies were carried
out in both steady shear and dynamic mode to ascertain the detailed
viscoelastic properties of the P4VP(DBSA) complexes at different solution
concentrations.

Steady Shear Rheological Measurements
Steady-state
rheological measurements of the P4VP(DBSA)x complexes, dissolved in DMF, were done in the solution concentration
range of 4–30% (w/v). The detailed viscosity versus shear rate
plots for complexes, at each molar ratio and different solution concentrations,
are provided in the Supporting Information (Figure 1S). The results revealed that the neat P4VP solution exhibited
Newtonian behavior in the shear rates used in the experiments (0.1–1000
s–1) at all investigated solution concentrations.
The solutions exhibited almost Newtonian behavior even for the P4VP(DBSA)
supramolecular complexes at molar ratios between 0.05 and 0.25. However,
as will be discussed later, the shear viscosities were found to increase
significantly as the DBSA content in the solution was increased. As
the molar ratio was further increased to 0.5, the solution started
to exhibit shear thinning behavior at high shear rates when the concentration
was more than 16%. Furthermore, as the molar ratio was further increased
up to 1.0, the shear thinning behavior was observed to occur at comparatively
much lower shear rates. The zero shear viscosities of the P4VP(DBSA)
complex solutions at four different concentrations are shown in Figure 4. The figure shows
that the zero shear viscosity of the P4VP(DBSA) complexes increased
as the molar ratio of the complexation increased. Furthermore, at
high solution concentrations, where the increase in the zero shear
viscosity up to a molar ratio of 0.1 was modest, the increase was
more substantial at molar ratio of 0.25 and higher. Hence, a higher
density of the DBSA bound to the P4VP chains led to a significant
increase in the solution viscosity.

Figure 4 Zero shear viscosity at 4, 10, 16, and
30% (w/v) as a function
of different molar ratios of DBSA/4VP.

The significant increase in the viscosity of P4VP(DBSA) complexes
as well as the non-Newtonian behavior observed in solutions, at high
molar ratios, strongly indicated the presence of increased entanglement
and/or physical interactions between polymer chains in the solvent.
The shear thinning behavior is generally attributed to the structural
transitions of temporary three-dimensional (3D) networks taking place
at high shear rates. Increased entanglement density and/or physical
interactions are known to result in the formation of such 3D network
structures of polymer chains. In Figure 5, the increase of the zero shear viscosity
with x is more significant for the highest P4VP concentration.
At higher solution concentrations, the hydrophobic alkyl tails were
expected to be in close proximity with each other resulting in increased
hydrophobic interactions, which were likely to result in much higher
P4VP chain entanglements leading to additional contribution toward
rise in solution viscosity. As shown in the figure, the hydrophobic
associations of the long alkyl tails work as alternate entanglement
regions, which then are responsible for increase in viscosity as well
as viscoelastic properties. The model also highlights the importance
of the increased DBSA density bound to the P4VP chains on the rise
in viscosity. The higher binding fraction is necessary for effective
hydrophobic associations of the alkyl tails.

two interactions at low and high concentrations:

Specific Viscosity versus
Concentration Plots
The steady
shear rheological data were further analyzed by plotting the specific
viscosity of the P4VP(DBSA) complexes as a function of solution concentration
from where the different concentration regimes were determined. Figure 6 shows the double
logarithmic plots of specific viscosity versus solution concentration
at each DBSA/4VP molar ratio investigated in this work. According
to the past studies, the different regimes are basically separated
by three critical concentrations (C): C* (onset of semidilute unentangled regime), Ce (onset of semidilute entangled regime), and CD (onset of concentrated regime).43−45 The viscosity
exhibits an exponential rise with concentration, and each regime follows
power-law relationship 1  where n is
the scaling exponent. For polymer solution in a good solvent, it has
been found that ηsp ∼ C1.0 in the dilute regime and ηsp ∼ C1.25–2 in the semidilute unentangled
regime, whereas ηsp ∼ C3.7–4.8 in the semidilute entangled regime. The actual
value of the power-law exponent was found to depend on the solvent
nature, i.e., theta or good solvent.44,46 The semidilute
entanglement regime is known to play a crucial role in predicting
electrospinnabilty as well as directs the microstructure of nanofibers
electrospun from a polymer solution. It has been reported that Ce is the critical concentration at which beaded
fiber formation starts and, in general, uniform bead-free nanofibers
are produced at solution concentrations which are 2–2.5 times
that of Ce.22,47,48 In the concentrated regime, the dimensions of chains
do not have any dependence on concentration and also do not follow
the polymer solution thermodynamics since the effect of polymer–solvent
interactions on chain dimensions is negligible in highly concentrated
solutions.43

Figure 6 Specific viscosity as
a function of P4VP concentration at different
DBSA/4VP molar ratios.

Specific viscosity scaling factors
for the experimental solutions
in the semidilute unentangled, semidilute entangled, and concentrated
regimes were determined from the linear slopes in the log–log
plots of specific viscosity versus concentration as shown in Figure 6. The values of slope
along with the critical concentrations of each regime are reported
in Table 1. Since the
rheology was performed on solutions with concentration greater than
4 wt %, the dilute regime for most of the complexes was not accessible.
From Figure 6, it could
be ascertained that for complexes with molar ratio from 0 to 0.5,
the semidilute unentangled and entangled regimes were accessible within
the concentration range in which solutions were investigated. The
neat P4VP solution in DMF showed a scaling relationship of ηsp ∼ C1.99 for the semidilute
unentangled regime and ηsp ∼ C3.54 for semidilute entangled regime. The exponents were
in close agreement with those reported in the past for different concentration
regimes.23,44,46 The two discrete
regimes were found to meet at approximately 12 wt %, which corresponded
to the transition from semidilute unentangled to semidilute entangled
regime. Hence, in this case, 12 wt % was the critical entanglement
concentration (Ce) from which the electrospinnable
solution concentration could be ascertained.

On addition of DBSA in different
stoichiometric ratios in P4VP(DBSA)x complexes
(0.05 ≤ x ≤ 0.50), the scaling relationships
for the two distinct concentration
regimes were found to be ηsp ∼ C1.78–2.20 and ηsp ∼ C3.06–3.54, respectively. The scaling
exponents, n, were again in agreement with the theoretical
predictions. More significantly, a gradual decrease of Ce was observed from 12 to 8 wt % as the molar ratio was
increased up to 0.50. This was attributed to the increased junction
points created in the solution, due to the hydrophobic interactions
between the DBSA tails anchored to the P4VP, which induced more entanglement
between the polymer chains, as shown schematically in Figure 5. The decrease in Ce was expected to favor electrospinning at lower solution
concentrations.

The supramolecular complexes at higher molar
ratios, i.e., P4VP(DBSA)0.75 and P4VP(DBSA)1.00, also revealed two distinct
concentration regimes in the specific viscosity vs concentration plots.
However, in this case, the value of the scaling exponent, n, revealed that the semidilute unentangled concentrated
regime was plausibly lower than the lowest concentration used in the
present study. The value of the scaling exponent, n, suggested that the two concentration regimes observed corresponded
to semidilute entangled and concentrated regimes. The concentrated
regime was not observed for the complexes until molar ratio of 0.5
even at the highest solution concentration studied. The concentrated
regime started emerging only from P4VP(DBSA)0.75 molar
ratio as evidenced by the drastic change in viscosity magnitude. This
transition from semidilute entangled to concentrated regime in both
P4VP(DBSA)0.75 and P4VP(DBSA)1.00 took place
at 25 wt % solution concentration, and the intersection point was
denoted by CD (onset of concentrated regime).
There are two major driving factors for the appearance of this regime:
first one is the electrostatic interactions of the P4VP chains with
the sulfonate head group of the surfactant and hydrophobic interactions
between the alkyl tails of the DBSA molecules anchored to different
P4VP chains at multiple locations and the second one is the P4VP chain
entanglements, which bring about the formation of dynamic 3D network
in solution.

Dynamic Rheological Measurements
The rheological behavior
of P4VP(DBSA) complex solutions was further analyzed by carrying out
the frequency sweep measurements. The temporary entanglements formed
by ionic and hydrophobic interactions of P4VP and DBSA in DMF behave
similarly to the chemical cross-links. However, unlike the case for
chemical cross-links, here, under deformation, the chains can move
past each other influencing the viscoelastic properties of the formulations.
These properties can be evaluated by oscillatory mode of the rheometer.
The detailed viscoelastic behavior of neat P4VP and its complexes
with DBSA in DMF solutions, at different concentrations, under dynamic
mode of rheometer by frequency sweep analysis is shown in the Supporting
Information (Figure 2S). The magnitude
of the elastic moduli (G′) and viscous moduli
(G″) was found to increase as the solution
concentration increased. The cross-over between the two dynamic moduli
was not observed within the studied frequency range; however, it appeared
to shift toward lower frequency with increasing solution concentration.
The addition of DBSA resulted in a progressive increase of both the
dynamic moduli at each solution concentration. This behavior was more
explicit from Figure 7, which compares the dynamic moduli of the P4VP(DBSA) complexes at
three different concentrations. The figure clearly shows the increase
in the elastic and loss moduli as the molar ratio was increased. Furthermore,
cross-over frequencies were also observed to shift to lower frequency
with increase in the DBSA molar ratio, suggesting an increase in the
characteristic relaxation time of the system.22 Most interestingly, a sudden increase in the elastic modulus was
observed at much lower solution concentrations as the molar ratio
of the DBSA was increased in the complexes as shown in Figure 8, where storage moduli of different
solution concentrations are given at 10 rad/s as a function of different
molar ratios of DBSA/4VP. For x = 1.0, the critical
concentration after which the enhanced elasticity was observed was
found to be 16 wt %. This clearly revealed an enhanced elastic behavior
of the solutions at higher molar ratios of DBSA. These results further
provided strong evidence for the formation of higher degree of chain
entanglements driven by hydrophobic interactions between the DBSA
alkyl chains bounded to the P4VP chains. The enhanced elasticity of
the polymer solutions was expected to favor the electrospinning process
at lower concentrations.

(G′, closed symbols) and loss (G″, open
symbols) depicted for P4VP at (a) 10%, (b) 16%, and (c) 30% (w/v)

Electrospinnability and Its Correlation to
Solution Properties
The electrospinnability of the neat P4VP
and its complexes with
DBSA was ascertained by carrying out the electrospinning experiments
under similar conditions. The morphologies of the electrospun fibers
showed transition from droplets, beaded fibers to almost bead-free
fibers. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the electrospun
fibers of neat P4VP at different solution concentrations are shown
in Figure 9. The figure
shows that transition from droplets to beaded fibers (Cbf) occurred at 12 wt %. This corresponded well with the
rheological results, which revealed the start of semidilute entangled
regime (Ce) at the same solution concentration
for neat P4VP. Interestingly, even though the density of beads decreased
as the solution concentrations increased, completely bead-free fibers
were not obtained even up to 35 wt % concentration (∼3Ce) under the used spinning conditions. It is
well known that the P4VP chains are semiflexible in nature and has
a very high critical entanglement molecular weight (Me ∼ 30–40 kg/mol).23 Hence, high solution concentrations are necessary for sufficient
entanglements to buildup for attaining the required viscoelastic behavior
necessary to obtain bead-free nanofibers.

Figure 9 SEM images of electrospun
fibers of neat P4VP solutions in DMF
at different concentrations, 8–30% (w/v).

The addition of DBSA, however, resulted in a remarkable improvement
in electrospinnability of the P4VP solutions even at very low molar
ratios. Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 show the SEM images of the electrospun fibers
obtained at different solution concentrations as the molar ratio of
DBSA was varied from 0.05 to 0.5. The critical concentrations corresponding
to the onset of beaded and bead-free fibers are summarized in Table 2. At the lowest molar
ratio of 0.05, the critical concentration at which beaded fibers formed
was found to be 12%, whereas the onset of bead-free fibers was observed
at a solution concentration of 25 wt %, which was significantly lesser
than that for neat P4VP. It was remarkable that even though the rise
in viscosity and elasticity of polymer solutions composed of P4VP(DBSA)0.05 complexes were not significant, the decrease in the effective
solution concentration needed to obtain bead-free fibers was substantial.
Hence, it is plausible that at such low molar ratios, the improvement
in the electrospinnability result from a combined favorable effect
of increase in viscoelastic properties as well as conductivity of
the solution. However, as the molar ratio was further increased, the
effect of change in the viscoelastic properties became more pronounced.
In the case of P4VP(DBSA)0.1 complex, where the Ce was observed at 10% solution concentration,
the transition from droplets to beaded fibers (Cbf) was also observed at 10%. Moreover, the solution concentration
corresponding to the onset of bead-free fibers (Cf) further reduced to 20%. The hydrophobic interactions
now were sufficiently high to increase the interchain contact points,
which facilitated electrospinning of bead-free fibers. Further increase
in the molar ratio of DBSA to 0.25 and 0.5 led to the reduction in
the Cf to 16 and 12%, respectively. This
was 1.7 and 1.5 times of Ce observed for
respective complex solution and corresponded reasonably well with
the electrospinnability correlation with the Ce as observed in some other systems.47 Hence, at a molar ratio of 0.5, bead-free electrospun nanofibers
could be obtained at solution concentrations almost more than 3 times
lower compared to that needed for neat P4VP. This could be attributed
to the formation of a well-developed network of topological entanglements,
driven by hydrophobic interactions of surfactant tails, which leads
to a highly viscous system with an increased contribution of the elastic
forces. The significant increase in viscosity strongly resists the
electrical stretching as well as surface tension forces that favor
bead or droplet formation during the electrospinning process.

Interestingly, even though further
increase in DBSA molar ratio
to 0.75 and 1.0 led to a dramatic increase in the solution viscosities
and the electrospinnability of these solutions could be visually observed
at comparatively lower concentrations, the SEM analysis did not show
the presence of fibrous structures on the surface. As already discussed, Ce values at these molar ratios were lower than
the studied minimum solution concentration (4%) studied, whereas the
concentrated regime, which was not observed at lower molar ratios,
could be observed at 25% signifying a highly entangled polymer solution.
Hence, the absence of fibers, as ascertained from microscopy tools,
was surprising. However, it must be noted that DBSA is highly hygroscopic
and it is plausible that, at higher molar ratios, the P4VP(DBSA) complex
takes up a lot of moisture such that the fiber morphology is destroyed.
This was indeed found to be the case since a quick morphology observation,
immediately after electrospinning, under an optical microscope indeed
revealed the fibrous morphology. Hence, at higher molar ratios, the
present approach has a limitation of fiber instability due to high
moisture absorption. However, in future, we plan to carry out more
studies on such complexes at higher molar ratios to understand the
effect of moisture on fiber stability. We would also like to note
that DBSA could be removed by treatment with an aqueous alkali solution
such that neat P4VP fibers could be obtained. Our future work will
focus on this aspect as it also provides a pathway to produce porous
fibers.

Effect of Complexation on Fiber Diameter
The relative
contribution of different factors on the electrospinnability could
also be understood by observing the variation of fiber diameters with
respect to different parameters such as solution concentration, molar
ratio, and viscosity. Figure 14 shows the variation of fiber diameters as a function of molar
ratio at two different solution concentrations, i.e., 20 and 30%.
The figure shows an increase in fiber diameter as the DBSA/4VP molar
ratio increases at the same solution concentration. These results
are significant as they provide good information about the dominating
factor influencing electrospinnability as the DBSA concentration was
increased in the complex. The three major factors that could be considered
influencing the fiber formation here are the conductivity, surface
tension, and viscoelastic forces. As shown earlier, the surface tension
was not found to change much in the complexes relative to that of
neat P4VP and, hence, its effect could be neglected. The conductivity
increased significantly, as well as viscosity and elasticity of the
solution as the DBSA content was increased. The increase in conductivity
was expected to decrease the fiber diameter due to enhanced electrical
stretching of the spinning jet. The fact that the fiber diameter actually
increased suggested that the increased viscosity as well as elasticity
of the solution had a dominating influence on the formation of fibers.
The fiber diameter was found to increase almost linearly with the
increase in the DBSA/4VP molar ratio. This was indeed due to the formation
of well-developed network of physical entanglements, as molar ratio
increased, leading to a significant rise in the viscosity and elasticity
of the polymer solution. The influence of conductivity on electrospinnability,
at higher molar ratios, was expected to be negligible.

Figure 14 Diameter
of electrospun fibers of 20 and 30% (w/v) neat P4VP and
P4VP(DBSA) complexes as a function of various molar ratios of DBSA/4VP.

The fiber diameter was further
correlated with the solution concentration
as well as zero shear viscosity of the P4VP(DBSA) complexes. Figures 15 and 16 show the variation in fiber diameter with respect
to solution concentration and zero shear viscosity, respectively.
As expected, the fiber diameter increased with solution concentration.
The increase in chain entanglements at higher concentration resists
the jet stretching induced by the electric field forces and, hence,
thicker fibers are formed. In general, the correlation between fiber
diameter (D) and solution concentration (C) followed a power-law relation, which could be expressed
as D α Cn. The
scaling exponent, n, was found to be between 1.4
and 1.8 for neat P4VP as well as for most of the complexes. The exponent
values were found to be nearly similar to those reported elsewhere.20 It must be mentioned that the scaling exponent
for P4VP(DBSA)0.1 complexes were found to be slightly lesser
than other samples. This could plausibly be due to the combined contribution
of rheological and conductivity effects, which had opposite effect
on the fiber diameter.

and P4VP(DBSA) complexes

the scaling factor (n) according to the correlation D α Cn.

P4VP(DBSA)x complexes as a function of

The numbers in parentheses depict the scaling factor (n) according to the correlation D α (ηo)n.

The fiber diameter was also found to correlate with the zero
shear
viscosity (ηo) through a similar scaling law, which
could be expressed as D α (ηo)n. It is well known that viscosity increase
has a direct influence on the increase of electrospun fiber diameter.13,14,49,50 To corroborate the influence of viscoelastic properties, the dependence
of the electrospun fiber diameter on zero shear viscosities was ascertained
as shown in Figure 16. Most of the earlier studies have shown the scaling exponent to
be around 0.8.13,48 However, recently, Hashimoto
et al. have shown that the scaling exponent may have a value in the
range of 0.41–0.80.46 In the current
study too, the scaling exponents were found to be in the range of
0.44–0.51, which corroborates well with the findings of Hashimoto
et al. Here also, the lower value of scaling exponent in the case
of P4VP(DBSA)0.10 complexes may be attributed to the combined
contribution of rheological and conductivity effects.

Superstructure
of P4VP/DBSA Electrospun Nanofibers
It has been shown in
the past that P4VP(DBSA) and similar other comb-shaped
complexes display propensity to self-organize due to repulsion between
the polymer–polymer backbone and nonpolar alkyl tail.32−36,41 The self-organization results
in the formation of dominantly lamellar structure composed of a layer
composed of polymer backbone together with DBSA head group and another
layer consisting of alkyl tails. It was expected that similar self-organized
structure may also form in the electrospun nanofibers of P4VP(DBSA)
complex. This was ascertained using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
analysis shown in Figure 17. The SAXS intensity profile shows an intense scattering peak
at q ∼ 2 nm–1 and a higher
order peak at 4 nm–1. The 1:2 ratio of the two peaks
suggested that the scattering peaks could be attributed to the diffraction
from the self-organized lamellar structures formed by the P4VP(DBSA)
complexes. The interlamellar distance (d) corresponding
to this scattering peak was found to be ∼3 nm (d = 2π/qmax) and is similar to that
reported for P4VP(DBSA) self-assembled structure in bulk. Interestingly,
the higher order peak was much more intense for the nanofiber samples,
suggesting plausibly a higher degree of lamellar order. This could
be attributed to the chain orientation, which results during elongational
flow facilitating the formation of lamellar structures, as shown schematically
in Figure 17 for complexes
in bulk and electrospun fibers. The formation of self-organized lamellar
structure was further corroborated by the observed birefringence in
the electrospun nanofibers using a polarized optical microscope, as
shown in Figure 4S in the Supporting Information.

Conclusions
The rheology and electrospinnability
of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP)
complexed with dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA), at different DBSA/4VP
molar ratios, were investigated. The complexation resulted in a comblike
polymer with P4VP forming the hydrophilic main chain, whereas the
alkyl chains of DBSA constituted the hydrophobic brushes tethered
to the main chain. The solution viscosities of these comblike polymers
were found to increase significantly as the DBSA/4VP molar ratio of
the complex was increased from 0 to 1. The increase in viscosity was
attributed to the formation of higher degree of topological entanglements
driven by the hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl tails of
DBSA. The increase in topological entanglements was also corroborated
by the fact that the critical concentration, for transition from semidilute
unentangled regime to semidilute entangled regime, decreased from
12 wt % for neat P4VP to less than 4 wt % for P4VP(DBSA) complexes
with stoichiometric DBSA/4VP molar ratios. Furthermore, the dynamic
rheological experiments showed that the storage modulus and, hence,
elasticity of the solutions also increased significantly as the molar
ratio of complexation increased. The increase in the elasticity of
the P4VP(DBSA) complexes further provided solid evidence for the increase
in entanglements with increased DBSA fraction in the complexes. The
resultant increase in the viscosity and elasticity of the solution
led to a dramatic improvement in the electrospinnability of P4VP.
The critical solution concentration to obtain bead-free uniform nanofibers
of P4VP(DBSA) complexes was reduced to 12 wt %, which was not possible
for neat P4VP solution even up to approximately 35 wt %. Hence, the
present study provides a novel and simple approach for improving the
electrospinnability of stiff polymers, which generally requires very
high solution concentrations for bead-free nanofibers formation. Furthermore,
small-angle X-ray scattering and polarized optical microscopy results
revealed that the electrospun nanofibers of P4VP(DBSA) complexes self-assembled
in lamellar mesomorphic structures similar to those observed in bulk.
However, the electrospun nanofibers exhibited significantly improved
lamellar order which, might have been facilitated by the preferred
orientation of P4VP chains along the fiber axis.

Experimental Section
Materials
Poly(4-vinylpyridine) (P4VP) with a weight-average
molecular weight (Mw) of 160 000
g/mol and dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid (DBSA) with 95% purity were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Both the polymer and surfactant were
used without further purification. The solvent used for electrospinning,
i.e., dimethylformamide (DMF), was supplied by Fisher Scientific and
used as provided. The pKa values of P4VP,
DBSA, and DMF are 5, −1.8, and −0.3, respectively.51,52

Sample Preparation
P4VP(DBSA)x complexes were prepared in DMF solutions, where the molar ratio, x, indicates the number of surfactant molecules per 4-vinylpyridine
(4VP) repeat unit in P4VP and was varied from x =
0.05 to x = 1.00. The polymer concentration was varied
from 4 to 30% (w/v) at each of the aforesaid x values
of DBSA/4VP, to investigate the concentration and stoichiometric effects
on the solution properties as well as the morphology of the electrospun
fibers. In the first step, P4VP and DBSA solutions were prepared separately
in DMF and then magnetically stirred at room temperature (25–27
°C) until both the solutions give a clear appearance. In the
second step, DBSA solution is transferred dropwise into the P4VP solution.
The solutions then were allowed for further magnetic stirring at ambient
temperature (25–27 °C) for 2–4 days or more until
a clear homogenous solution is observed.

Electrospinning
To prepare electrospun fibers, each
of the solutions of P4VP/DMF and P4VP–DBSA/DMF complexes were
taken into a syringe and mounted on a syringe pump of an electrospinning
machine (E-Spin Nano). A high-voltage DC power supply of 20 kV was
applied to the needle. The working distance between syringe tip and
the collector plate was kept approximately at 20 cm and a flow rate
of 0.5 mL/h was used.

Characterization
FTIR Study
Chemical
and compositional characteristics
of the pure and prepared complexes were evaluated by infrared spectra
by using an FTIR spectrophotometer (Nicolet IS 50 FTIR, Thermo Fischer
Scientific) with an attenuated total reflection unit attached. Samples
were placed on a diamond crystal surface and measured in the range
of 4000–400 cm–1. An average of 64 scans
was taken for each measurement.

Conductivity Measurements
The electrical conductivities
of the samples were measured using a digital conductivity meter (Labtronics
Microprocessor) with a dip-type conductivity electrode having double-walled
glass jacket and a cell constant of 1 cm–1. The
temperatures of the solutions were maintained using a water bath.
The conductivity electrode was first calibrated with a freshly prepared
solution of 0.01 KCl with known conductivity at 25 °C. The reproducibility
of the conductivity measurement was within ±0.5 μS/cm.

Surface Tension Measurements
Surface tension measurements
of solutions were conducted using Wilhelmy plate method using a tensiometer
(Data Physics) at room temperature. Before each experiment, the plate
was cleaned using burner flame and ethanol to avoid any probable contamination
of solutions due to plate. Instrument was calibrated with double-distilled
water, which has a known surface tension of 72 mN/m. The precision
of the measurements of surface tension with the tensiometer was within
±0.03 mN/m.

Rheological Measurements
The rheological
behavior of
prepared P4VP/DBSA complex solutions were evaluated with an Anton
Paar MCR702 (single drive) stress-controlled rheometer using cone-plate
measuring systems (cone radii, 50 and 75 mm; cone angle, 1°)
with 0.150 and 0.05 mm truncations, respectively. Rheology of each
of the solutions was measured in both steady shear as well as dynamic
modes of the rheometer at 25 °C. The steady shear mode was used
to determine solution viscosities in zero shear and various shear
regimes as a function of shear rate ranging from 0.1 to 1000 s–1. The specific viscosity (ηsp) was
determined by the following formula 2  where ηs is the solvent viscosity
and ηo represents the zero shear viscosity. The viscosity
of DMF was calculated as 0.771 mPa s at 25 °C. The dynamic mode
of the rheometer was used to determine viscoelastic regime of each
solution. All of the dynamic studies were carried out at a constant
strain falling in linear viscoelastic regime with varying angular
frequencies ranging from 0.1 to 100 rad/s.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
The morphology of the
obtained electrospun fibers was observed by using a ZEISS EVO 18 scanning
electron microscope. Samples were mounted on a holder and gold-sputtered
to enable the conduction of electrons on the sample surface. The fiber
diameter was determined using ImageJ.

Small-Angle X-ray Scattering
Small-angle X-ray scattering
experiment was performed on SAXSess mc2 (Anton Paar Gmbh,
Graz, Austria). The X-ray source used was a sealed copper tube (40
kV/50 mA; wavelength, 0.1542 nm), and the detector was an imaging
plate. Exposure time allotted was 30 min per scan.

Polarized
Optical Microscopy
A Leica DM 2500P optical
microscope was used to detect the presence of mesomorphic order in
the nanofibers of complexes under crossed polarizers.
