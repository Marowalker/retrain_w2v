We developed a novel fabrication method for nanochannels
that are
easily scaled up to mass production by selectively growing zinc oxide
(ZnO) nanostructures and covering using a flat PDMS surface to make
hollow nanochannels. Nanochannels are used in the biotechnological
and environmental fields, being employed for DNA analysis and water
purification, due to their unique features of capillary-induced negative
pressure and an electrical double-layer overlap. However, existing
nanochannel fabrication methods are complicated, costly, and not amenable
to mass production. Here, we developed a novel nanochannel fabrication
method. The pillar-like dense ZnO nanostructures were grown in a solution
process, which is easily applicable to mass production. The size of
the fabricated ZnO nanostructures has a thickness of 30–300
nm and a diameter on the order of 102 nm, which are easily
adjusted by synthesis times. The ZnO nanostructures were covered by
the flat polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surface, and then the cracks
between ZnO nanostructures served as hollow nanochannels. Because
the suggested fabrication process has no thermal shrinkage, the process
has higher production efficiency than existing nanochannel mass production
methods based on the thermal/pressure process. The mechanical strength
of the fabricated ZnO nanostructures was tested with repetitive tape
peeling tests. Finally, we briefly verified the nanochannel performance
by applying the nanochannel to the micro/nanofluidic system, whose
performance is easily evaluated and visualized by current–voltage
relation.

Introduction
A nanochannel is a nanometer-sized (1–100
nm) hollow channel
exhibiting unique nanofluidic phenomena, including capillary-induced
negative pressure caused by the high surface-to-volume ratio and an
electrical double-layer overlap. Nanochannels have been used for DNA
analysis,1 virus detection,2,3 water purification,4 protein research,5,6 assessing molecule concentration,7,8 particle separation,9 and environmental monitoring.10 The current fabrication methods use conventional lithography
and include reactive ion etching,11 high-energy
beam processing,12 and interference lithography.13 However, nanochannels fabricated using conventional
lithography are not amenable to mass production; the high-energy beam
process has relatively low production speed, and reactive ion etching
and interference lithography have relatively smaller patternable areas.
Therefore, conventional lithography-based nanochannel fabrication
systems are hard to scale up to mass production.14,15 To overcome these limitations, hot embossing,16 thin-film deposition,17,18 and nanoimprinting19,20 have been studied; one- and two-dimensional nanochannels, as well
as array-type nanochannels, can be fabricated easily at a low cost.21,22 Although nanochannel fabrication techniques amenable to mass production
have been developed, deformation caused by thermal expansion remains
problematic; thermal shrinkage compromises nanochannel precision and
greatly reduces production efficiency. A highly efficient fabrication
technique ensuring nanochannel integrity is required.23 Here, we fabricated nanochannels via the selective growth
of a zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructure, followed by soft lithography
employing a mask pattern. Using hydrothermal synthesis, pillar-like
dense ZnO nanostructures were fabricated on silicon and glass wafers
to any height desired between 30 and 300 nm by adjusting the synthesis
time, and the structures were easily patterned on the surface with
conventional lithography mask patterns. The fabricated nanostructures
on a glass substrate are covered by a flat polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
block to make hollow nanochannels by plasma bonding. The mechanical
strength of the ZnO nanostructures was briefly tested with repetitive
3M tape peeling tests. The performance of the nanochannels is briefly
evaluated by applying them to a micro/nanofluidic system, whose performance
is easily evaluated and visualized by current–voltage relation.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows a
schematic of ZnO nanostructure fabrication using a mask pattern, PDMS
surface covering, for the formation of ZnO nanochannels and integration
to micro/nanofluidic devices. The experimental setups of nanofluidic
visualization and particle separation experiments are described in Figure 4. As shown in Figure 1, nanostructured
patterns were fabricated by coating of a seed layer, UV pattern lithography,
and hydrothermal synthesis on a bare glass substrate. In Figure 1, the patterned ZnO
nanostructure was bonded to a prepatterned PDMS microchannel replica
for the fabrication of nanochannels and integration to the micro/nanofluidic
system at once. For evaluating the fabricated nanochannel performance,
we applied an electric field to the micro/nanofluidic system to induce
a common nanofluidic, electrohydrodynamic phenomenon called “ion
concentration polarization (ICP)” (Figure 4A). To explore future application to biotechnology,
the micro/nanofluidic device was used to continuously separate microparticles
with the ICP phenomenon (Figure 4B). As shown in Figure 1, the device features two microchannels (main and buffer
channels) connected by ZnO nanochannels. As shown in Figures 3B and 4A, the fabricated nanochannels are marked with red dashed rectangles
between the two microchannels. Unmarked nanostructures exist only
for the convenience of fabrication and have little impact on the experiments.
The main channel has two inlet reservoirs (two cylinder-type reservoirs
at the left side of the main channel) that are connected to a syringe
pump system for applying a pressure-driven flow to the micro/nanofluidic
device. The other three reservoirs (three cylinder-type reservoirs
at the right side of the main channel) are exposed to air to act as
outlets. The buffer channel also has two reservoirs that are connected
to syringes filled with an electrolyte solution, but these syringes
are locked at certain reservoir levels to prevent solution flow in
the buffer channel. In the nanofluidic visualization experiment setup
(Figure 4A), there
is also no solution flow in the main channel, so only two reservoirs
are connected to locked syringes and the other reservoirs (gray-colored
reservoirs) are blocked by a commercial epoxy before injection of
the electrolyte solution. The anodes are inserted at each side of
the main channel reservoirs, and the cathodes are inserted at each
side of the buffer channel reservoirs, as shown in Figure 4A. In the continuous particle
separation experiment, all the reservoirs are used as inlets or outlets.
In the main channel, two types of microparticles are continuously
injected from the inlet reservoir located above. At the same time,
a sheath flow is injected from the other inlet reservoir that merges
in front of the nanochannel and flows to the outlet. The sheath flow
pushes the particle flow, keeping the particles located at the side
wall before they are spatially separated by the ICP phenomenon. Details
about particle separation are explained in Figure 6.

Figure 2 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the ZnO nanostructure pattern.
As shown in Figure 2A, a linear ZnO nanostructure pattern (width, ∼200 μm)
was fabricated on a glass substrate, consistent with the UV lithography
pattern. Figure 2B
shows an enlargement of the nanostructure pattern; a flower-shaped
ZnO structure was densely synthesized on the surface. As shown in Figure 2C, the height differences
of the nanostructures were ∼100 nm, and the cracks created
between the sharp tips of the ZnO nanopillars act as nanochannels
after PDMS bonding.24 A previous study
found that the density and height of ZnO nanostructures could be controlled
by specifying the distribution of the seed layer and the duration
of hydrothermal synthesis.25

3M Scotch tape 10 times on the synthesized zinc oxide nanostructures,
the surface was observed by SEM (Figure 3B). Comparing SEM images before and after
the experiment, the morphology of the zinc oxide nanostructures did
not change. Based on the experiment, it was confirmed that the adhesion
between the zinc oxide nanostructure and the substrate is very strong
and that the mechanical rigidity of the nanostructure surface is excellent.

Although it is generally meaningful to evaluate
the performance
according to the cross-sectional size of hollow nanochannels fabricated
through PDMS bonding, the size of many nanochannels fabricated through
the bonding process is not constant and it is not practical to measure
it directly. Also, from the standpoint of making a system connecting
nanochannels and microchannels, the unique phenomenon of nanochannels
such as the ICP phenomenon is almost impossible to use when nanochannels
exist alone. To access fluids or apply electric fields to nanochannels,
fusion with microchannels is absolutely necessary. Therefore, we conducted
a characterization experiment using a micro/nanofluidic device, deciding
that the evaluation of the characteristics of the micro/nanofluidic
device was as meaningful as that of the nanochannel alone. We fabricated
the nanochannel between the two microchannels to check whether the
nanochannels are connected to the desired position without disconnection
and indirectly confirmed the connection whether or not the ICP phenomenon
occurs. In addition, it was confirmed that the performance of the
fabricated nanochannels can be controlled by varying the total number
of nanochannels by adjusting the width of the ZnO nanostructure pattern.

ICP is a fundamental electrochemical phenomenon developing around
ion-selective membranes when an electric field is applied across the
ion-selective membranes. When a microchannel is filled with an electrolyte
solution, the surfaces of the microchannels have certain net charges
based on their material property. To compensate the net charges, counterions
near the surface adhere to the surfaces, forming an “electric
double layer”. Generally, the thickness of the electric double
layer is on a scale of nanometers; there are a few effects of the
double layer when the width of each microchannel surface is much larger
than that of the electric double layer. However, when the channel
distances are reduced to a nanometer scale, the effect of the electric
double layer is increased, resulting in an unbalanced ion concentration
around the surface. Therefore, the nanosized channel passes only cations
or anions, thus generating ion mismatches on both sides when an electric
field is applied to the electrolyte solution. Thus, an ion depletion
region develops on one side of the membrane and an ion enrichment
region on the other side. Cells and charged particles become depleted
or enriched around the ion depletion region; concentration and desalination
can thus be achieved.

As the behavior of charged particles changes
in the ion depletion
region, nanochannel performance can be easily visualized using fluorescent
dyes. We found that the operating voltage at which ICP developed varied
by the width of the ZnO nanostructure pattern. The details are shown
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 shows an
experimental result where ICP can be induced with the fabricated ZnO
nanochannel pattern. These figures are the magnified view of Figure 4A, where the nanochannel is located. As shown in Figure 5A, the two microchannels (main channel on the top and buffer
channel at the bottom) were filled with green fluorescent dyes in
1 mM DSP solution. It was hard to observe ZnO nanostructures and bonded
nanochannels with a fluorescence microscope because the ZnO patterns
were thin and had no fluorescence. Therefore, we performed the visualization
experiment using the fluorescence filter after confirming the position
of the nanochannel through the white light mode. When no electric
field is applied, the concentrations of ions and fluorescent particles
are identical over the entire microchannel (Figure 5A). When an electric field above a certain
level is applied, ion depletion commences near the nanochannel at
the anodal side. Because the fluorescent dyes have net charges in
the electrolyte solution, the green fluorescent particles are also
depleted rapidly around the nanochannel (Figure 5B). Because the ICP phenomenon is a kind
of dynamic equilibrium, the depletion region cannot be distributed
evenly in all directions. The width of the nanochannel pattern in
the figure is 200 μm; ICP is observed when a voltage of 140
V is applied. The relationship between the ZnO nanopattern width and
the ICP operation voltage is shown in Figure 5C. The nanochannel pattern width was varied
over 100, 200, and 400 μm; both limiting and overlimiting current
regions are observed at different voltage sections, which means that
the electrical property of a ZnO nanochannel is controllable by adjusting
the pattern width. In general, the ICP phenomenon shows three phases
of current response depending on the voltage increase. When the voltage
is lower than the certain voltage required for the ICP phenomenon
to occur, the current–voltage curve follows Ohm’s law.
If the electric field around the nanochannel is sufficiently strong
to trigger ICP, the limiting period commences; the low ion concentration
of the ion depletion region limits ion transport through the nanochannels,
so there was almost no current rise accompanying the voltage rise
and this situation persists until the overlimiting period commences.
When the voltage becomes higher than that of the overlimiting region,
the depletion region is disturbed by a vortex caused by the excessive
electric field, and the current rises as ions pass through the depletion
region.26,27 As shown in Figure 5C, the results show that the smaller the
width of the pattern, the higher the voltage when the limiting period
commences. This is because when the pattern is small, the number of
effective nanochannels that can pass ions is fewer than the number
of wide nanochannels so that ion movement at the same voltage is reduced.
Therefore, a higher voltage is required to move ions sufficiently
rapidly to generate a depletion region.

ICP was applied. (C) Current–voltage response of the nanochannels
with three different nanostructure pattern widths. The colored voltage
sections indicate the section when an ICP phenomenon occurs without
the overlimiting current.

Figure 6 shows that microparticles are continuously
separated
in the fabricated nanochannels. As the ion depletion region has a
higher electrical resistance than the surrounding region, the electric
field becomes concentrated in the former region. A previous study
showed that charged particles were more efficiently separated under
such circumstances.28 Particles in the
electric field are subject to electrophoretic forces applied in the
direction of that field, imparting electrophoretic mobility, a characteristic
of the particles in a certain electrolyte solution. Previous results
have shown that the electrophoretic force that changes the particle’s
path is more affected by the electrophoretic force of the particle
than the particle size. In this experiment, particles of similar size
were selected to consider only the effects of electrophoretic forces. Figure 4B shows an enlarged
view of the main channel near a nanochannel. Figure 6A shows that when no electric field is applied,
two microsized particles flow together downward from the microchannel
without any distortion of trajectory. When ICP develops, the trajectories
of particles in the depletion region are shifted from the bottom (Figure 6B). The two particles
are now separated spatially; the trajectories of particles of greater
electrophoretic mobility are shifted more. Incomplete flow, nanochannels,
and particle conditions can cause some particles to deviate too much
from the path. However, most of the particles move in a similar path,
and additional experiments under the same conditions show that most
of the particles, after passing through the nanochannel, are spatially
separated and directed in a constant path.

Particles that have similar sizes but different electrophoretic mobilities
are selected for electrical force-based continuous separation (1.0
μm-diameter particle with a relatively large electrophoretic
mobility (μep,1.0μm = −8.6 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1) and 1.1 μm-diameter particle with a relatively low electrophoretic
mobility (μep,1.1μm = −6.5 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1)).

Conclusions
We developed a new and simple method of
nanochannel fabrication,
which is easily scaled up to mass production through a solution-based
fabrication process. The pillar-like dense ZnO nanostructures were
hydrothermally synthesized on a glass substrate and covered by a PDMS
surface to make hollow nanochannels. The cracks between the sharp
ZnO nanopillars acted as the walls and floor of the nanochannels,
and the PDMS surface became the ceiling of the nanochannels. The suggested
fabrication does not require expensive equipment or a complicated
process such as conventional lithography; moreover, our method affords
a much more stable pattern than conventional mass production via heat
deformation employing hot embossing or nanoimprinting. The fabricated
nanochannels were evaluated by a fundamental nanofluidic phenomenon
called ion concentration polarization, which is easily evaluated by
the current–voltage response and visualized by fluorescent
dyes. We proved that the performance of the fabricated nanochannel
could be controlled by adjusting the ZnO nanochannel pattern width.
The pattern widths of ZnO nanostructures were fabricated differently
in the same type of micro/nanofluidic device as 200–400 μm,
thereby varying the approximate number of nanochannels. Then, the
current–voltage response confirmed that the ICP phenomenon
easily occurs as the number of nanochannels increases. Finally, we
confirmed the possibility of the nanochannels for biotechnological
applications by performing continuous separation of two kinds of microparticles
using the fabricated micro/nanofluidic device. The experiments resulted
in the successive separation of two types of particles with different
electrical properties, and in the future, it is expected to be useful
for the treatment of proteins, DNAs, and cellular materials with different
electrical properties in solution. The ZnO nanochannels could be fabricated
on any surface on which a seed layer can be grown, including flexible
films or polymer membranes. In the future, the synthesis times of
ZnO nanostructures, seed layer formation method, substrate, and so
on will be adjusted in various ways to check the performance according
to the dimension difference of individual nanochannels and to confirm
the possibility of large-area nanochannel fabrication. We expect that
our novel nanochannel fabrication method will contribute to nanotechnological
applications in biotechnology and environmental science.

Experimental Section
Materials
Polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP, analytical reagent
(AR), MW: 1,300,000] powder, ammonia solution [NH4OH, AR,
28.0–30.0% (m/m)], and HCl (AR) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO, USA). Zinc chloride (ZnCl2, AR) and zinc
nitrate hexahydrate [Zn(NO3)2, AR] were purchased
from Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). The PDMS (AR) was purchased
from Dow Corning (Midland, MI, USA). All reagents were used as received
without further purification.

ZnO Nanostructure Fabrication
We spin-coated a uniform
seed layer onto a glass substrate. A polymer solution containing Zn
ions was prepared by adding 500 mM Zn(NO3)2 and
0.1 g/mL PVP (final concentrations) to deionized water, followed by
stirring at 600 rpm with a magnetic stirrer for 2 h. The polymer solution
was spin-coated at 5000 rpm to deposit a seed layer onto a glass substrate;
the polymer film was then decomposed and calcinated in air at 500
°C to form a ZnO seed layer.29 Hydrothermal
growth was used to fabricate nanostructures on this seed layer. The
growth solution was prepared by adding 10 mM ZnCl2 and
5 μL/mL NH4OH (final concentrations) to deionized
water at 40–80 °C to initiate the reaction. NH4OH was used to raise the pH via generation of OH– species. ZnO nanostructure formation is influenced by pH, the concentration
of Zn2+ ions, and the solution temperature; it is important
to keep these conditions constant. In particular, maintenance of a
constant temperature (here, 60 °C) is very important; even a
small increase in temperature changes the response rate.25

Patterning of ZnO Nanostructures
We used a lithographic
method to pattern bulk ZnO nanostructures on the substrate when fabricating
nanochannels at a desired position. Masking tape or a standard microelectromechanical
system (MEMS) lithographic technique was used. Masking tape was cut
using a paper cutter (CAMEO; Silhouette America, Inc., Orem, UT, USA)
to obtain the desired patterns. We also used UV lithography. AZ 5214
photoresist was spin-coated onto glass at 3000 rpm for 30 s and then
soft-baked in an oven at 100 °C for 1 min; the surface was exposed
to 150 W of UV light for 7.5 s and then developed with a 2.38% (w/v)
tetramethylammonium hydroxide solution. The seed layer and the ZnO
nanostructures can be selectively modified/removed using dilute HCl
(0.5 mM). We fabricated ZnO nanostructural patterns with widths of
100, 200, and 400 μm.

3M Scotch Tape Peeling Test for Confirming Mechanical Strength
of the ZnO Nanostructures
ASTM (American Society for Testing
and Materials) certified tests were performed to verify the mechanical
stability of the zinc oxide nanostructures. ASTM D3359-02 is a test
that verifies mechanical stability by attaching a commercial 3M Scotch
tape to a target device and then removing it repeatedly. We performed
repetitive 3M tape attachment and peeling to ZnO nanostructures that
are fabricated on a glass substrate without lithographic patterns.
A total of six ZnO nanostructure samples were prepared: three samples
without the taping test and three other samples with 10 tape peeling
tests. SEM images were used to confirm the results before and after
the taping test.

Fabrication of the Micro/Nanofluidic Device
Nanostructured
ZnO was used to create a nanofluidic device via a PDMS-to-glass plasma
bonding method.30 As can be seen in Figure 1, the ZnO nanostructures
are patterned in strips on a glass substrate to connect two parallel
microchannels. The two PDMS microchannel patterns are fabricated by
soft lithography, with SU-8 inverse pattern molds and a PDMS replica
(main and buffer channels; length, 2 cm; width, 100 μm; height,
35 μm; between-channel gap, 200 μm). When the two microchannels
are bonded on the top of the glass substrate, the ZnO nanostructures
at the gaps between the two microchannels are bonded to the flat PDMS
surface. Because the ZnO nanostructures are rough (Figure 2C), the PDMS surface does not
completely fill the cracks between the nanostructures and these cracks
continue, eventually acting as a hollow nanochannel connecting two
microchannels.

In this paper, the fabricated micro/nanofluidic
device was used for two types of experiments: the visualization experiment
of nanochannel phenomena to evaluate the nanochannel performance (Figure 5) and continuous
particle separation experiment for future biotechnological application
(Figure 6). In the
nanofluidic visualization experiment, microchannel outlets that are
not used for electrolyte injection were blocked with commercial epoxy
before electrolyte injection (Figure 1).

Microfluidic Device Measurements
In the two experiments,
1 mM dibasic sodium phosphate (DSP) dissolved in distilled water was
used as the electrolyte solution. In the visualization experiment,
fluorescein sodium salt was diluted in the buffer to allow observation
of the nanofluidic phenomenon near the fabricated nanochannel. As
can be seen in Figure 4A,B, anodes and cathodes consisting of a platinum rod were connected
to the reservoirs of both microchannels and used to apply electric
fields by a source measurement unit (B2902A; Keysight Technologies,
Inc., Santa Rosa, CA, USA). An inverted fluorescence microscope (IX71;
Olympus Co., Tokyo, Japan) and a charge-coupled device camera (DP72;
Olympus) were used to observe the behavior of fluorescent dyes and
to collect images. In the particle separation experiment, two types
of fluorescent polystyrene particles (Thermo Scientific Corp., Waltham,
MA, USA) differing in terms of diameter (1.0 and 1.1 μm) and
electrophoretic mobility (μep) (μep,1.0μm = −8.6 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1 and μep,1.1μm = −6.5 × 10–4 cm2 V–1 s–1) were separated. Particle mobility
was measured using a zeta potential analyzer (Zetasizer Nano Z; Malvern
Instruments, Malvern, U.K.); particles were diluted in a 1 mM DSP
buffer.
