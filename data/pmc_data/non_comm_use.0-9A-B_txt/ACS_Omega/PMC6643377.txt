We
have performed a systematic investigation of the nature of the
nontrivial interface states in topological/normal insulator (TI/NI)
heterostructures. On the basis of first principles and a recently
developed scheme to construct ab initio effective Hamiltonian matrices
from density functional theory calculations, we studied systems of
realistic sizes with high accuracy and control over the relevant parameters
such as TI and NI band alignment, NI gap, and spin–orbit coupling
strength. Our results for IV–VI compounds show the interface
gap tunability by appropriately controlling the NI thickness, which
can be explored for device design. Also, we verified the preservation
of an in-plane spin texture in the interface-gaped topological states.

1 Introduction
In
1970, Esaki and Tsu published a seminal paper in which they
proposed a solid-state artificial structure, the superlattice (SL).1 This material is engineered as a periodic modulation
of the composition of an alloy, with a period much larger than the
host material lattice parameter (see Figure 1a). This new class of synthetic semiconductor
structures allowed a profusion of new technological applications to
appear.2 Nowadays, SLs are not restricted
to the realm of semiconductors but are ubiquitous throughout solid-state
physics. Such heterostructures are well controlled experimentally,
where different techniques are used in their synthesis, e.g., molecular
beam epitaxy and metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy deposition. Furthermore,
SLs are fabricated from a wide range of materials, such as magnetic
and nonmagnetic metals, insulators, and superconductors.3,4

semiconductor heterostructure. (b) Topological/normal insulator heterostructure

than the critical value (LC). The topologically
protected Dirac states (TPDS) are strongly hybridizing originating
the Δhyb gap. (c) TI/NI heterostructure where LNI > LC and the
TPBS are decoupled.

More recently, topological
insulators (TIs)5−7 were added to
the previous list.8,9 TIs form a class of materials
that present an insulating bulk with robust conducting states on their
boundary. A question that arises naturally is how the TI properties
are affected by interfacing with trivial materials, in a sequential
way forming a SL. It is well known that on a TI surface the metallic
topological states are Dirac-like with a spin texture that gives rise
to a spin current protected from backscattering by time-reversal symmetry.
Nevertheless, TIs interfaced with a regular or normal insulator (NI)
are poorly understood. Some recent studies show unequivocally the
appearance of Dirac cones at the TI/NI interface.10−18 Existing calculations19−21 and recent experiments22 predict that states at the interface, located
predominantly within the normal material, could acquire spin texture
because of their proximity to the topological interface states. Now,
let us consider a system composed of layers of TI and NI stacked in
an alternating fashion, forming a one-dimensional superlattice. Such
a system can bring novel technological applications, especially considering
the sequence of interfacial nontrivial states and their spin orientation.

Our findings show a direct relationship between the normal insulator
thickness (LNI) and the appearance of
topologically protected Dirac states (TPDS) at the SL interfaces.
For a LNI smaller than the critical thickness
(LC), the band structure will have the
features of Figure 1b, with a hybridization gap (Δhyb) that is the result
of TPDS interaction of adjacent interfaces. The linear dispersion
Dirac states shown in Figure 1c will be present only for large LNI (greater than LC). On the other hand,
a metallic Dirac crossing is always present at the TI in contact with
the vacuum (surface), independent of the inner LNI width. Also, our calculations point out an inverse relationship
between the NI gap and the critical thickness LC.

The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we give a brief description
of the methodology
used to construct the effective Hamiltonians and how the spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) is included; we also compare these results to fully
relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations for validation.
The computational details are described in Section 3. In Section 4, the effective Hamiltonian results are discussed and
compared to DFT calculations.

2 Methodology
This
section briefly describes the methodology used to construct
the effective Hamiltonians and the inclusion of the spin–orbit
coupling (SOC) effect. The central idea is to map the plane waves
(PWs) Hilbert space, in general composed of several thousand of PWs,
onto the compact subspace spanned by the pseudoatomic orbitals (PAOs)
|ϕμ⟩ used to construct the atomic pseudopotentials.
The Hamiltonians are constructed from the Kohn–Sham (KS) Bloch
states (|ΨKS⟩) projection onto the PAO basis
set localized at the atomic sites. Considering the PAO basis set incompleteness,
some KS states are not accurately described. These manifest themselves
as unphysical eigenvalues and hybridizations. The solution is to apply
a filtering procedure to shift these states outside the energy window
of interest. The filtering procedure is based on the so-called projectability
number (pn), which is
defined as pn = ⟨Ψn|P̂|Ψn⟩ and the operator P̂ projects the KS states onto the PAO basis set. The interpretation
of pn is straightforward;
KS states with pn ≈
1 (≈0) represent states that are well (poor) described by the
given PAO basis set. In this work, the pn threshold is set to 0.95. This methodology has been
successfully applied to different materials to compute many properties;
for a full description, see refs (23−27). Since the PAO Hamiltonian resembles the traditional tight-binding
(TB) Hamiltonians, we will refer to it as TB Hamiltonian.

Spin–orbit
coupling effect is essential to describe the
topological quantum states in TI. In our calculations, the SOC is
introduced in two different ways: standard fully relativistic self-consistent
DFT calculations28 and an effective approximation
in the TB Hamiltonian.27,29 The effective SOC included in
the TB Hamiltonian can be written as 1  where λ is the, orbital- and element-dependent,
spin–orbit coupling strength, and L and S are the orbital and spin angular momentum operators, respectively. Figure 2 shows a comparison
between DFT with SOC (solid black line) and the TB + SOC (open red
circles) in Bi2Se3 hexagonal bulk band structure.
The Bi and Se p-orbitals’ SOC parameters used are λBi = 1.475 eV and λSe = 0.265 eV. These values
are in good agreement with the literature30 and were obtained via a fitting procedure of the Bi and Se body-centered
cubic DFT-SOC band structure. The agreement between the DFT and TB
is excellent. Same degree of agreement is observed for a Bi2Se3 surface with four quintuple-layers (Qls), see Figure 3a,b, and in TI/NI
heterostructures: to this end, we considered a heterostructure composed
of two NI Qls between four TI Qls; see the inset in Figure 3c. In the TB Hamiltonian, such
a heterostructure is constructed by setting Bi and Se SOC parameters
to zero in the NI region, i.e., λBi = λSe = 0. The DFT calculation was performed with a Bi and Se
nonrelativistic pseudopotential in the NI region to mimic the SOC
absence. The DFT with SOC and TB + SOC heterostructure band structure
are shown in Figure 3c,d, respectively. In the bulk and surface cases, the agreement is
outstanding. The bulk TB Hamiltonian is available in the Supporting Information along with the Bi2Se3 crystal unit cell.

The ideas described above are used to construct
the heterostructures
calculated in this work. From the Hamiltonian matrix of the (1 ×
1 × 1) Bi2Se3 hexagonal supercell (details
of the supercell are given in the next section), we can construct
massive bulk supercells, up to 400 Å in thickness (1 × 1
× 16), with and without surfaces. These massive supercells preserve
the exceptional agreement demonstrated previously.

3 Computational Details
We performed density functional theory
(DFT)31,32 calculations using the plane wave package
Quantum Espresso33,34 and Vienna ab initio simulation
package code.35,36 The generalized gradient approximation37 was employed to treat the correlation among
electrons with the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
parametrization.37 The Bi and Se ionic
potentials are described using projector augmented wave pseudopotentials38 with s, p, and d as valences. The Bi2Se3 is a rhombohedral crystal with space group D3d5 (R3̅m) and a five-atoms unit cell. To facilitate the interface construction
and results’ interpretation, a Bi2Se3 hexagonal cell composed of 15 atoms was used; see Figure 2a. This cell contains three
Qls where the intra (inter) Ql chemical bonding is of ionic/covalent
(van der Waals) character. The experimental lattice parameter is adopted
with a = 4.134 Å and c = 28.63
Å. The reciprocal space sampling uses the Monkhorst–Pack
scheme with k-meshes of 19 × 19 × 3 and
19 × 19 × 1 for bulk and surface calculations, respectively.
We also performed a fully relativistic calculation for a heterostructure
of Bi2Se3 and a real trivial system Sb2Se3. Since both systems present similar lattice parameters,
we used the average lattice parameter for the hexagonal plane (a = 4.107 Å) and the vertical c =
30.90 Å for Sb2Se3. At the interface, the
average of both structures was used, c = 29.765 Å.
The calculated topological invariant using these parameters gives Z2 = 1 for Bi2Se3 and Z2 = 0 for Sb2Se3.

4 Results and Discussion
4.1 Bulk TI/NI Superlattices
Using the
TB method, where the NI region is described by suppressing the SOC,
in this section we construct an infinite periodically bulk TI/NI superlattice
(without any surface). In Figure 4, the Bi2Se3 bulk band structure
is shown (a) without SOC and (b) with SOC; the SOC increases the gap
from 0.16 eV (direct gap) to 0.33 eV (indirect gap), which is in agreement
with previous calculations.30 In panel
(c), we show the band structure for a 4/8 (TI/NI) infinite heterostructure
where the topological states at the interface become massive and a
hybridization gap (Δhyb) of 42 meV appears at the
Γ̅ point. The Δhyb gap originates from
the TPDS hybridization through the NI material. Its value is reduced
by increasing the NI thickness, and the TPDS re-emerge above a critical
thickness (LC) around 200 Å (≈21
Qls); see panel (d). These superlattices are chemically and structurally
perfect; as a consequence, there is no Rashba splitting, which would
appear because of inversion symmetry breaking, as reported in ref (39). In a real heterostructure,
the NI region is formed by different materials; thus, it is important
to understand the relationship between the NI gap (ΔNI) and LC. To simulate a variation on
the ΔNI gap within the TB model, a local potential
is applied to Bi and Se p-states. As shown in Figure 4e, there is an inverse relationship between
ΔNI and LC. By increasing
ΔNI to 0.5 eV, the LC is reduced to 75 Å (≈8 Qls). This finding is important
to guide the experimental search for suitable constituent materials
of heterostructures with desired properties.

meV hybridization gap (Δhyb) is obtained. (d) Δhyb evolution as the NI thickness is increased. (e) Relation
between the NI gap (ΔNl) and the critical thickness
(LC) is shown.

4.2 TI/NI Heterostructure Terminated in TI or
NI
In this section, we investigate heterostructures with
vacuum terminations. Two different constructions will be explored:
one NI between two TI regions (TI/NI/TI) and one TI between two NI
(NI/TI/NI) regions as building blocks for realistic TI/NI superlattices.
In Figure 5, we show
the band structure for the 4/8/4 (TI/NI/TI) sandwich, projected on
the interfaces. The plot shows states with high (above 60%) spectral
weight at the indicated regions (the insets of panels (a) and (b)).
In Figure 5a,b, the
NI region gap is 0.16 eV (no SOC potential is applied and λBi = λSe = 0.0), and the TI and NI bands are
perfectly aligned, as indicated in panel (c). The TPDS are observed
at the surface, and their dispersions are consistent with the four-Qls
Bi2Se3 surface. However, the TPDS at the TI/NI
interface are replaced by states with parabolic dispersions and a
42 meV hybridization gap. This is in perfect agreement with the situation
in the 4/8 infinite superlattice, including the size of the hybridization
gap. In panels (d) and (e), we investigate the effect of increasing
the NI band gap on the TPDS. For a gap of 0.5 eV, no significant change
is observed at the surface. At the NI interfaces, however, the TPDS
are restored, with an increased dispersion and an upward energy shift.
This result strongly suggests that large NI band gaps effectively
decouple the two TI/NI interfaces. Similar to that in ref (40), we explore the relation
between band alignment and the TPDS formation. As in the previous
cases, the surface TPDS are not significantly affected by the band
misalignment (panel (g)), while the ones at the NI/TI interface are
dramatically shifted downward in energy (panel (h)).

Figure 5 Spatial projected band
structure for a 4/8/4 (TI/NI/TI) finite
heterostructure. Projection onto the outermost two TI Qls at the surface:
(a) ΔNI = 0.16 eV (bands aligned), (d) ΔNI = 0.50 eV (bands aligned), and (g) ΔNI =
0.50 eV (bands not aligned). In (b), (e), and (h), the projection
is calculated at TI/NI interface for the respective heterostructures.
The shaded areas of the insets of panels (a) and (b) show the projected
regions. In (c), (f), and (i), a schematic representation of the band
alignment for the respective heterostructure is shown.

The next heterostructure is composed of a TI between
two NI (NI/TI/NI)
with equal thicknesses. With such construction, the dispersion of
TPDS acquires a parabolic shape, as seen in Figure 6a. This larger dispersion results in the
reduction of the Fermi velocity when compared with the four-Qls surface
linear dispersion; see Figure 3b. Another important feature is the localization, in energy,
of the bulk states between Γ̅ and M̅. For the four-Qls surface, this state is located 90 meV below the
Dirac point (DP). Once the TI is placed in between two NI layers,
these states shift down to 240 meV below the DP. This effect is due
to the absence of SOC at the surface since λBi =
λSe = 0.0. As an exercise to understand this behavior,
the Se SOC is restored (λSe = 0.265 eV) and the Bi
SOC is increased to 1.10 eV in the NI region. The bulk states are
150 meV below DP and move toward the surface value as λBi → 100%. This energy shift contributes to the reduction
of the influence of these bulk states on the Bi2Se3 transport properties.41,42 This has been observed
for (BixSb1–x)2Se3 alloys,43 where Sb reduces the overall SOC. Moreover, panels (c) and (d) show
the spatial localization of the TPDS; a significant penetration of
these states in the NI region is observed. This can be exploited to
establish contacts for transport measurements or attain functionalization,
for example.

eV and (d) λBi = 1.10 eV. Dark red (dark blue) represents
high (low) spectral weight at the projected regions. The inset of
panel (c), shaded region, highlights the projected region.

4.3 Multilayers of TI/NI Superlattice
Terminated
in TI
We also investigate a superlattice composed of multilayers
of topological and trivial insulators. The modulation is performed
by controlling the spin–orbit coupling, similar to the control
of topological phase by doping, as reported in ref (8). At the TI surface, the
TPDS are always present. Nevertheless, at the TI/NI interface, these
states are absent because of a strong hybridization between subsequent
interfaces. Figure 7, left panel, shows the schematic representation for a 4/2 (TI/NI)
heterostructure composed of 22 Qls (≈200 Å). In the TI
region (red), full Bi and Se SOC are adopted. In the NI region (blue),
the Se SOC is kept fixed at its full value and the Bi SOC is varied
from 50 to 0% of its full value. The Dirac-like states come from the
TI in the surface (red in panels (a)–(c)), and no contributions
come from the internal TI region (see panels (d)–(f)). We can
understand this by thinking about the 4/2 (TI/NI) structure as a unit
cell of a “new” or “meta” material. This
metamaterial is indeed a topological insulator with Z2 = 1, since there is only one band inversion in the first
Brillouin zone at the Γ point. In this way, for such thin films
of the TI/NI metamaterial, we predict surface metallic topological
states and a gapped bulk, exactly as shown in Figure 7. Naturally, by increasing the NI region
greater than the critical thickness, as shown above, gapless interface
TPDS will be restored. It is important to note that the Dirac crossing
at the interfaces will only succeed for a large NI region, when the
topological states of adjacent interfaces are effectively decoupled
from each other by the intervening NI layers.

Figure 7 Band structure for a
topological/normal insulator (TI/NI) finite
heterostructure. The left panel shows the heterostructure schematic
representation with four TI Qls (red) and two NI Qls (blue). In the
NI region, the Bi SOC strength is varied from 50% of its full value
to 0. The eigenvalues spatial projection onto the outermost four TI
Qls, at the surface, is shown in (a) 50%, (b) 25%, and (c) 0% of the
full Bi SOC. In (d), (e), and (f), the projection is onto the middle
region (TI and NI) of the slab. Dark red (dark blue) represents high
(low) spectral weight at the projected region; see the colorbar.

4.4 Bi2Se3/Sb2Se3/Bi2Se3 Heterostructure
To complement our discussion
above, fully relativistic first-principles
calculations of the Bi2Se3 (TI) interfaced with
Sb2Se3 (NI) were performed. Since both materials
are lattice matched, the heterostructure preserves the bulk topological
properties. For a periodic supercell composed of 4/2 (TI/NI), a gap
is formed (see Figure 8). There are topological surface bands at the interfaces that come
mostly from the TI side; however, the global gap is preserved. By
cutting our TI/NI supercell to produce top and bottom surfaces, a
different picture is observed, confirming our TB results above. As
shown in Figure 9,
the TPDS re-emerge at the surface and a gap is present at the Sb2Se3 interface. The whole system behaves as a unique
TI material, gapped inside but metallic at the surfaces. As shown
in Figure 9g, the TPDS
are Rashba-like states, due to the coupling between opposite interface
TPBS, as observed for surface states in thin films.44 The asymmetric distributions of the top and bottom surface
states (Figure 9f)
arise because of a symmetry breaking induced by the NI material. This
breaks the Bi2Se3 symmetry since the unit cell
demands three Qls, similar to stacking faults close to the surface.45

(c), and (d) show the spatial eigenvalue projections of a one-Ql from
the TI center region, TI, and NI at the interface, respectively.

show spin projections
on 1st, 4th, 7th, and 10th Qls, respectively. Blue and red are projections
of opposite in-plane spin textures. The Fermi level is at zero energy.

5 Conclusions
In conclusion, our calculations determine the topological state
properties in heterostructures composed of TI/NI materials. Depending
on the TI/NI heterostructure composition, topological states at adjacent
interfaces hybridize, through the intervening NI material, opening
a band gap at the Dirac crossing. We show that for NI layers thicker
than the critical value (LC), the hybridization
is suppressed and the bulk TPDS are restored. The topological states
are spatially localized at the TI/NI interface with a significant
penetration in the NI region because of the proximity effect. Our
calculations also indicate an inverse relationship between LC and the NI gap (ΔNI), demonstrating
that one should use a large-gap trivial material to obtain interface
metallic Dirac states for thin Ni layers; otherwise, massive gaped
topological states will be settled at the interfaces. Moreover, we
also verified that TI and NI band alignment plays an important role
in the stability of the TPDS. Even though the topological interface
states are massive, they preserve mostly the in-plane spin texture.
We have demonstrated that the gap of TI/NI heterostructure (or superlattice)
can be fine-tuned by controlling the NI region chemical composition
(which we mimic by varying the SOC strength) or its thickness. With
these results, we expect to contribute to the understanding of the
TI/NI heterostructure, which is important for the construction of
devices using topological insulator materials.
