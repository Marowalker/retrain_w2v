Large-scale
commercial synthesis of bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar
cell materials is very challenging and both time and energy consuming.
Synthesis of π-conjugated polymers (CPs) with uniform batch-to-batch
molecular weight and low dispersity is a key requirement for better
reproducibility of high-efficiency polymer solar cells. Herein, a
conjugated polymer (CP) PTB7-Th, well known for its high performance,
has been synthesized with high molecular weight and low dispersity
in a closed microwave reactor. The microwave reaction procedure is
known to be more controlled and consumes less energy. The precursors
were strategically reacted for different reaction time durations to
obtain the optimum molecular weight. All different CPs were well characterized
using 1H NMR, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), UV–vis,
photoluminescence (PL), electron spin resonance (ESR), and Raman spectroscopy,
whereas the film morphology was extensively studied via atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) techniques.
The effect of molecular weight on a conventional BHJ solar cell with
PC71BM acceptor was investigated to derive systematic structure–property
relationships. The CP obtained after 35 min of reaction time and integrated
into BHJ devices under ambient conditions provided the best performance
with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 8.09%, which was quite
similar to the results of CPs synthesized via a thermal route. An
enhanced PCE of 8.47% was obtained for the optimized polymer (35 min
microwave reaction product) when device fabrication was carried out
inside a glovebox. The organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) device
with the microwave-synthesized CP displayed better hole mobility (0.137
cm2 V–1 s–1) as compared
to that with the thermally synthesized CP. This study also proved
that the device stability and reproducibility of the microwave-synthesized
CP were much better and more consistent than those of the thermally
developed CP.

Introduction
Polymer solar cells
(PSCs) have gained great attention recently
as one of the leading fields within photovoltaic research because
of their unique advantages such as light weight, flexibility, easy
fabrication, low cost, quick energy payback time, and ease of device
fabrication scale-up.1−9 The most established and widely studied device concept among all
PSCs is a bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) system, where an acceptor and
a donor molecule having complementary optical absorption behavior
and well-matched energy levels are blended together to provide a distinct
active layer.10 A power conversion efficiency
(PCE) of >13% has been reported by designing and developing new
molecules
and applying different device engineering strategies.11−14

Quite a few molecular designing strategies have been established
over the past few years to optimize the optical properties and band
gap of donor materials.15 Donor (D)–acceptor
(A) copolymerized conjugated polymers (CPs) with low band gaps are
widely used as the most successful donors in the active layer of BHJs
for improved performance. The optoelectronic properties of the CPs
can also be tuned by structure variation of D and A, side chain modulation,
and modification of functional groups.15,16 Commonly,
these π-conjugated copolymers are synthesized by Pd(Ph3)4-catalyzed Stille polycondensation.17 For several D–A CPs, it has been reported that the
molecular weight (Mw) and polydispersity
index (Đ) of the CPs largely affect the hole
mobility, molecular orientation and crystallinity, optoelectronic
properties, thin-film morphology, and device performance.18−22 Generally, higher molecular weight CPs demonstrate a better PCE
due to enhanced charge carrier mobility, better optical absorption,
and superior intermixed film morphology.21−23 Yet, CPs with
much higher Mw have solubility problems,
leading to poor BHJ morphology as well as lower PCE. Recently, it
has also been established that with increasing Đ values of the CPs, the PCE drops gradually.24 Therefore, CPs with optimum Mw and lower Đ are needed for better device performances. However,
CPs synthesized from metal-catalyzed polycondensation reactions lead
to inconsistent device performances from one synthetic batch to another
batch. This batch-to-batch variation is due to the differences in Mw, Đ, and residual palladium
contamination in various batches.25−27 It is also challenging
to synthesize these CPs on a large scale for commercialization. Hence,
various methodologies have been carefully investigated for the improvement
of the Stille coupling reaction protocol. A recent article has discussed
the comparison between CPs achieved from Pd2(dba)3/P(o-tol)3- and Pd(PPh3)4-catalyzed Stille polycondensation.28 Another report disclosed almost negligible batch-to-batch variations
in organic photovoltaic (OPV) performance acquired from stepwise heating
in the Stille coupling reaction.29 Nowadays,
microwave (MW)-assisted Stille copolymerization is also being used
at times to synthesize higher Mw CPs with
lower Đ.30,31 The MW reactions in
a closed (pressurized) reactor is much more advantageous in terms
of ultrafast and homogeneous heating and use of a smaller amount of
solvent that decrease the side reactions and improve the reaction
yields to provide a ultrahigh-quality product. This MW process is
also more energy-efficient than conventional heating as well as open-vessel
microwave reactions.32,33

Herein, we present the
strategic synthesis of a well-known high-performance
donor CP (PTB7-Th) through Stille polycondensation in a closed MW
reactor. PTB7-Th CPs with different molecular weights have been synthesized
by varying the MW reaction time from 25 to 45 min through single-step
heating. All CPs have been characterized by 1H NMR, gel
permeation chromatography (GPC), UV–vis, photoluminescence
(PL), Raman, and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy, atomic
force microscopy (AFM), and grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD)
to reveal the structural differences in terms of D–A ratios
and backbone purity. Conventional BHJ devices (Figure 1a) were fabricated with these MW CPs in combination
with PC71BM, where the active layer was spin-coated under
ambient conditions.34 The photovoltaic
results of these MW CPs were extensively correlated with the properties
of CPs. Multistep heating reactions were also performed, but they
resulted in poor device performance and stability. Organic thin-film
transistor (OTFT) devices were also fabricated (Figure 1b) with microwave- and thermally synthesized
CPs to determine the charge carrier transport behavior of the CPs,
where the microwave-synthesized CP showed a better hole mobility of
0.137 cm2 V–1 s–1.

Results
and Discussion
Optical and Electrochemical Characterization
The optical
absorption of the microwave (MW)- and thermally synthesized CPs is
depicted in Figure 2a. All CPs exhibit almost similar absorption behavior with a predominant
absorption peak at ∼705 nm along with an additional peak at
∼635 nm. The lower wavelength shoulder peaks appear with equal
intensity for MW25m, MW35m, and Thermal CPs, while this is largely
increased for the MW45m CP. Moreover, the absorption spectrum becomes
more broadened for MW45m compared with those of the other CPs with
a blue shift of almost 6 nm (Table 1). These absorption behaviors suggest that MW45m contains
higher proportion of homocoupled units, such as (4,8-bis(5-(2-ethylhexyl)thiophen-2-yl)-benzo[1,2-b:4,5-b′]dithiophene-2,6-diyl)bis(trimethylstannane)
(BDTT)–BDTT and 2-ethylhexyl-4,6-dibromo-3-fluorothieno[3,4-b]thiophene-2-carboxylate (FTT)–FTT, in the CP backbone.24,35 The optical absorption in blend films (Figure 2b) revealed that the light-harvesting property
initially increases with increasing molecular weight but decreases
for very high molecular weight. This is because of reduced solubility
and deprived film quality of the CP. This can be well correlated with
the GPC data (Figures S3–S4). Lower
molecular weight CPs (MW25m and MW35m) exhibit unimodal distribution
in their molecular weight, whereas MW45m shows a trimodal distribution.
This trimodal behavior indicates that the polymer quality is modified
in the case of MW45m since the longer time of radiation, although
helps to further increase the molecular weight, might lead to the
degradation or scission of polymer chains. The electrochemical behavior
of the CPs was studied with cyclic voltammetry (see Figure S5).

and Electronic Energy Levels of the Synthesized Polymers

Thermal	49.5	149.3	3.01	706	779	1.59	–5.29	–3.70	
The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of all CPs were also calculated
(Table 1). MW45m exhibits
a lower lying HOMO as compared to other CPs (Figure S6).

The backbone irregularities of the CPs were well
examined by Raman
spectroscopy (Figure 2c). The vibrational modes of thiophenes, existing in the CPs, are
Raman-active because of their prominent coupling with the delocalized
π-electrons. All CPs disclose five significant Raman peaks.28 Thermal, MW25m, and MW35m exhibit similar spectra,
whereas MW45m shows a significant change in Raman vibrational modes.
The coupled vibration of the stretching mode (C=C) of fused
thiophenes (present in the BDTT unit) to the non-fluorinated thiophenes
of the FTT unit (peak 3) and the coupled vibration of the stretching
mode (C=C) of the non-fluorinated thiophene to the quadrant
stretching mode (peak 4) of MW45m illustrate a much broader and higher
intensity spectrum. Also, stretching modes (C=C) of the side
chain thiophenes in the BDTT unit (peak 1) of this CP are observed
with a higher intensity along with a shift of ∼3 cm–1 to higher wavenumbers. This enhanced intensity of the vibrational
modes in the Raman spectrum is evidence for the presence of homocoupled
units in the CP main chain. Hence, Thermal, MW25m, and MW35m have
a much lower quantity of defective units as compared to MW45m. These
defective units in the CP backbone can act as deep traps in photovoltaic
devices and might hamper device performance. Photoluminescence (PL) study (Figure 2d) was performed to estimate
the emission strength of the CPs having different molecular weights.
MW35m has an improved emission compared with MW25m due to its higher
molecular weight. The Thermal CP also reveals slightly lower emission
in comparison to MW35m. However, MW45m shows a lower emission in spite
of having a higher molecular weight. This can be described by considering
the structural defects and, hence, self-quenching caused by photoinduced
charge transfer from the regular repeating units of the CP to the
homocoupled defect units.

ESR Spectroscopy
Considering the
information about
the synthesis and physical characteristics of the synthesized CPs,
it can be assumed that the molecular framework of the CPs does not
introduce any spin-active species. Therefore, the ESR spectra of the
studied CPs should not display any type of ESR signal. Nevertheless,
they reveal a prominent ESR signal, which evidences the existence
of radical species (Figure 3). It is believed that the presence of ESR signal is due to
some structural defects of the CP backbone or some unpaired electrons
coming from chemical impurities. These radical species may act as
deep traps for mobile charge carriers and greatly affect the solar
cell device performance of the CP.36 ESR
spectra of all CPs showed a similar polycrystalline pattern with a g factor of 1.998 ± 0.001. The signal intensity is
proportional to the concentration of radical species. MW25m and MW35m
demonstrate almost comparable signal intensity, which implies equivalent
radical concentration. The Thermal CP shows a higher signal intensity
in comparison to MW35m. However, MW45m has a much higher radical concentration
as indicated by its enhanced signal intensity. Hence, MW45m has more
trap states than MW25m and MW35m, which could hinder the charge transport
in the solar cell device. From this result, we can expect that the
MW45m CP will give a lower photocurrent (Jsc) and mobility.

Solar Cell Device Characterization
OPV devices with
a conventional architecture were fabricated for the assessment of
photovoltaic properties of the donor CP along with PC71BM as the acceptor. During device fabrication, the active layer was
spin-coated under ambient conditions (outside the glovebox in the
presence of air). The current density–voltage (J–V) characteristics of the air-processed
devices for the four CPs are shown in Figure 4a (the data are summarized in Table 2). The data indicate that with
increasing molecular weight of the CPs (from 64.1 to 167.2 kDa) the
PCE is enhanced significantly from 5.97 to 8.09%. However, a further
increase in molecular weight results in a reduction of the PCE. A
comparable trend in PCE with the molecular weight of thermally synthesized
PTB7-Th along with non-fullerene acceptors has already been reported.22 The maximum performance is achieved for MW35m
with an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of
0.826 V, fill factor (FF) of 64%, short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 15.30 mA cm–2, and
a PCE of 8.09% for the best device. This is one of the highest efficiencies
reported for air-processed organic solar cells (OSCs) with PTB7-Th
as the donor in the conventional device configuration.34 A comparable PCE of 7.91% is achieved with the
Thermal CP. The observed increment in PCE with increasing molecular
weight is mainly because of the significant improvement in Jsc, which, in turn, is caused by the enhanced
light-harvesting ability and better hole mobility. The hole mobility
of the CPs follows a similar trend to Jsc (Figure S7 and Table S1). A high FF of
above 60% is witnessed for CP samples of up to 167.2 kDa, while a
drop in FF of almost up to 50% is seen with a further increase in
the molecular weight. There are solubility issues and differences
in intermixed film morphology and crystallinity for very high molecular
weight CPs, which reduce the FF. Yet, MW45m shows a relatively higher Voc than the other two CPs mainly because of
the lower lying HOMO. Therefore, an optimal molecular weight is essential
for better solar cell performance. Moreover, the CPs synthesized from
different batches of microwave reaction show outstanding reproducibility
by suppressing the batch-to-batch variation in solar cell device performance
(Figure S8). To further increase the device
performance of the optimized CP, MW35m, devices are fabricated inside
a glovebox to observe an enhanced PCE of 8.47% (Table S2 and Figure S9).

External
quantum efficiency (EQE) spectra of all solar cell devices
demonstrate a strong photoresponse in the broad spectral region from
300 to 800 nm (Figure 4b). The considerable variations of the Jsc values, obtained from J–V measurements, are well reflected in their EQE spectra. The integrated Jsc values calculated from EQE spectra are 14.27,
11.81, 14.36, and 6.95 mA cm–2 for Thermal, MW25m,
MW35m, and MW45m, respectively, with a discrepancy of ∼7% compared
to the Jsc values obtained from the J–V curve. This mismatch may be
attributed to the different measurement conditions. The J–V characterization was carried out inside
a glovebox under an argon atmosphere, whereas the EQE measurements
were executed outside the glovebox.

OTFT Device Characterization
OTFT devices with top-contact/bottom-gate
geometry were fabricated with MW35m and Thermal CPs to evaluate the
charge transport in two CPs. The devices were fabricated under ambient
conditions with two organic dielectric layers (poly(vinyl alcohol)
(PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)) and CPs as the active
layer. The OTFT device parameters are presented in Table 3, and the output and transfer
characteristics are shown in Figure 5. The device with the Thermal CP shows a current on/off
ratio of 6 × 102 and a high hole mobility of 0.024
cm2 V–1 s–1 in the
linear region, whereas MW35m demonstrates a better device performance
with a higher hole mobility of 0.137 cm2 V–1 s–1 and a current on/off ratio of 2 × 104. Both the CPs exhibit almost similar root-mean-square (rms)
roughness of ∼1.1 nm in the AFM study (Figure S10). Therefore, the higher hole mobility and lower
off-current of MW35m in comparison to those of the Thermal CP can
explain its enhanced emission intensity. Also, MW35m exhibits a lower
ESR signal intensity, which implies lower radical concentration and
lower trap density.

Morphological Characterization
The morphology of the
blend films was extensively studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM)
to reveal the effect of molecular weight of the MW-synthesized CPs
(Figure 6a–d).
The topographic images of the blend films did not display any difference
in microstructures with a comparable rms roughness of ∼1.4
nm for all films. Therefore, the morphology of the donor–acceptor
blends was evaluated through a grazing incidence X-ray diffraction
(GIXRD) study to obtain clear insight into the crystallinity and molecular
packing of different films. The (100) lamellar peaks are observed
in the in-plane profile at qxy = 2.78,
2.71, 2.86, and 2.64 nm–1 and the calculated lamellar
spacings are 2.26, 2.32, 2.20, and 2.38 nm for blends of Thermal,
MW25m, MW35m, and MW45m, respectively (Figure S11 and Table S3). Hence, MW45m exhibits the highest lamellar
spacing among all, and hence, transport of charge becomes difficult.
Similarly, the π–π stacking peaks are calculated
from the one-dimensional (1D) line-cut profile obtained at qz = 13.31, 13.31, 13.31, and 13.46 nm–1 for blends of Thermal, MW25m, MW35m, and MW45m, respectively, and
the calculated π–π spacing is ∼0.47 nm.
The lamellar peak intensity of MW35m is much higher in comparison
to those of other CPs in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions.
A similar trend is also observed for the π–π stacking
peak intensity. These data indicate that MW35m exhibits a more preferential
face-on orientation than other CPs. The face-on orientation in the
donor–acceptor blend is favorable for better vertical charge
transport, which improves the PSC performance. Figure 6e–h shows the two-dimensional (2D) q-plot of the blend films of the three samples. All four
blends show unique characteristics of concentric circles in their
films. No prominent concentric circles are found in any of the samples.
But looking at the 2D q-plot, it can be confirmed
that the film of the MW35m blend is the most crystalline having one
discrete circle and the film of the MW45m blend is found to be the
most amorphous having diffused circles in the 2D q-plot. The crystallinity of the film of Thermal and MW25m blends
is in between those of the MW35m and MW45m samples. This result can
be well compared with the device result, i.e., the MW35m blend displays
the highest PCE (also Jsc) and the MW45m
blend displays the lowest PCE.

Stability Study
Stability is a very
important parameter
for any type of solar cell for real-life applications. The thermal
stability of the best device was studied for unencapsulated devices
stored in an argon atmosphere. For this study, the device was heated
at 70 °C and thermally synthesized PTB7-Th devices were taken
as controls. It could be clearly seen that the MW-synthesized CP showed
better thermal stability compared to the Thermal CP (Figure 7). Both the CPs revealed a
sharp decay in their PCE within the first 250 min. After that, the
efficiency of MW35m entered into a stable zone and remained almost
unchanged, whereas for Thermal, the PCE kept on decreasing. After
1500 min of heating, MW35m degraded up to 56% but Thermal retained
only 16% of its original PCE. A comparison of the device efficiency
and stability achieved in this work with those in recent reports is
given in Table S4. This illustrates that
the microwave reaction method is a very promising technology for the
development of high-performance and stable solar cell devices.

Conclusions
In this work, controlled synthesis of PTB7-Th
in a closed-vessel
microwave reactor has been successfully achieved. This reaction protocol
is very convenient to synthesize CPs with higher Mw and comparatively lower Đ, consuming
much lower energy. Importantly, this method offers much better quality
materials for devices with very low batch-to-batch variation, which
is very important for large-scale commercial synthesis of donor CPs
through Stille polycondensation. As a remarkable development, the
device fabrication was carried out under ambient conditions unlike
most cases, where a purely inert atmosphere is followed. MW35m (with
a higher Mw of 167.2 kDa and a lower Đ value of 2.67) shows an efficiency of 8.09%, with
a FF of 64%, a VOC of 0.826 V, and a Jsc of 15.30 mA cm–2, which
is very consistent and better than that of the CP synthesized through
a thermal route, and the PCE is further improved to ∼8.5% in
devices fabricated inside the glovebox. These PCE values are among
the highest efficiency for PTB7-Th in air/ambient-processed and inert-condition
devices. Additionally, the OTFT devices fabricated using MW35m exhibit
a better hole mobility of 0.137 cm2 V–1 s–1.

[BDTT], were obtained from Derthon Optoelectronic Materials Science
Technology Co. Ltd. and directly used. Indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates
(15 Ω sq–1) and PC71BM (>99.5%)
were obtained from LUMTEC, and poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene
sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) (PVP AI4083) was obtained from Clevios. All
other chemicals were used as received.

Synthesis and Characterization
of CPs
Monomers BDTT
(100 mg, 0.11 mmol) and FTT (52 mg, 0.11 mmol) were introduced into
the microwave reactor vessel (closed). A solvent mixture of toluene–dimethylformamide
(DMF) (3:1, 2 mL) was added to it. After that, argon was purged for
20 min; the Pd(PPh3)4 catalyst was then added
to the reaction mixture and again argon was purged for 20 min. Finally,
the reactor vessel was refluxed at 150 °C under microwave conditions
(microwave power 150 W and pressure 20 psi) for different time durations
(25, 30, 35, 40, and 45 min) strategically to prepare CPs with varying
molecular weights. After completion, the resulting CP solution was
precipitated in 200 mL of methanol. The precipitate was then further
purified through Soxhlet extraction sequentially with 300 mL each
of methanol, hexane, acetone, and chloroform. Again the solution was
passed through a Celite bed. The CP was further precipitated in methanol
and finally the pure CP was dried in a vacuum. This CP was also synthesized
by a conventional heating method (thermal heating on a hot plate)
according to a literature process.37 All
CPs were characterized via 1H NMR spectroscopy and GPC
(Figures S1–S4).

Device Fabrication
Solar Cells
PSC
devices were fabricated with the conventional
architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/donor polymer:PC71BM/Ca/Al.
Each device had a cell area of 0.06 cm2. The donor–acceptor
blend solution (for the active layer) was prepared using chlorobenzene
(CB) as a processing solvent at a concentration of 35 mg mL–1 (D/A ratio 1:1.5). Then, it was kept at 50 °C and constantly
stirred for 6 h for proper dissolution, and a small amount (3%, volume)
of 1,8-diiodooctane (DIO) was also added to it 15 min before spin
coating. Patterned ITO glass substrates were cleaned sequentially
using deionized (DI) water, acetone, and isopropanol. Then, they were
dried using dry N2 gas, and UV–ozone treatment was
carried out for 20 min. Next, PEDOT:PSS (AI4083) was spin-coated on
the ITO substrate at 4000 rpm and then annealed at 140 °C for
10 min. After cooling, the blend solution was spin-coated at 3000
rpm followed by methanol treatment for the removal of DIO.38 Lastly, calcium (∼20 nm) and aluminum
(∼100 nm) were thermally deposited (ca. 5 × 10–6 Pa) onto the MeOH-treated active layer. Except for metal deposition,
the entire device was fabricated under ambient conditions.

OTFTs were fabricated on glass substrates. An
aluminum gate electrode of thickness 100 nm (width 1 mm) was thermally
deposited on the glass substrate using a shadow mask. On it, 10% w/v
PVA solution in DI water was spin-coated at 1000 rpm for 40 s and
annealed for 30 min at 100 °C to give a layer of 1 μm thickness.
Then 3% w/v PMMA solution in anisole was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for
60 s and annealing was performed at 100 °C for 90 min. The thickness
of the PMMA layer was determined to be 100 nm. The CP solution (10
mg mL–1) in CB was used as the active layer, and
1% DIO was added to it 15 min before coating. The polymeric active
layer was spin-coated on the PMMA surface at 2000 rpm for 60 s and
then annealed at 70 °C for 10 min. All device fabrication procedures
were carried under ambient conditions. For source–drain electrodes,
a buffer layer of ∼5 nm MoO3 and ∼60 nm copper
was thermally deposited. The devices were fabricated with a channel
length (L) of 40 μm and channel width (W) of 800 μm through a shadow mask.
