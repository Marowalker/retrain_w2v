We report the synthesis of nitrogen-doped
carbon nanotube sponges
(N-CNSs) by pyrolysis of solutions of benzylamine, ferrocene, thiophene,
and isopropanol-based mixture at 1020 °C for 4 h using an aerosol-assisted
chemical vapor deposition system. The precursors were transported
through a quartz tube using a dynamic flow of H2/Ar. We
characterized the N-CNSs by scanning electron microscopy, transmission
electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric
analysis. We found that isopropanol, isopropanol–ethanol, and
isopropanol–acetone as precursors promote the formation of
complex-entangled carbon fibers making knots and junctions. The N-CNSs
displayed an outstanding oxygen concentration reaching a value of
9.2% for those synthesized with only isopropanol. We identified oxygen
and nitrogen functional groups; in particular, the carbon fibers produced
using only isopropanol exhibited a high concentration of ether groups
(C–O bonds). This fact suggests the presence of phenols, carboxyl,
methoxy, ethoxy, epoxy, and more complex functional groups. Usually,
the functionalization of graphitic materials is carried out through
aggressive acid treatments; here, we offer an alternative route to
produce a superoxygenated surface. The understanding of the chemical
surface of these novel materials represents a huge challenge and offers
an opportunity to study complex oxygen functional groups different
from the conventional quinone, carboxyl, phenols, carbonyl, methoxy,
ethoxy, among others. The cyclic voltammetry measurements confirmed
the importance of oxygen in N-CNSs, showing that with high oxygen
concentration, the highest anodic and cathodic currents are displayed.
N-CNSs displayed ferromagnetic behavior with an outstanding saturation
magnetization. We envisage that our sponges are promising for anodes
in lithium-ion batteries and magnetic sensor devices.

1 Introduction
Carbon
nanotube sponges (CNSs) are three-dimensional networks of
interconnected carbon nanotubes with outstanding physical and chemical
properties such as superhydrophobicity,1 surface chemical functionalization,2 porosity,3 elasticity,4−6 electrical conductivity,7 low thermal conductivity,8 and high energy dissipation.9 CNSs have
also been used as filter nanoparticles,10 absorb oils,1,11−14 transport nanoparticles,15 supercapacitors,16−18 fuel cells,19 electrodes,20,21 deionize water,22 and as scaffolds for cell seeding in biological
applications.23

The chemical vapor
deposition (CVD) method has been the most common
method to produce CNSs.24,25 Gui et al.1 reported using the CVD method, the production
of CNSs. They used a solution containing 1,2-dichlorobenzene and ferrocene
as precursors. Their CNSs showed flexibility and capacity for oil
absorption reaching up to ∼170 times its weight. They also
reported in other investigation using a similar experimental approach
the production of sponges formed by carbon nanotubes with Fe inside.26 Shan et al.7 synthesized
three-dimensional CNSs using ferrocene, thiophene, and pyridine by
the CVD method. Their carbon sponge exhibited welded junctions and
elbows formed by the presence of nitrogen that boosted a three-dimensional
growth. They demonstrated that sulfur concentration plays a role in
tuning the diameters of carbon nanotubes. Camilli et al.14 fabricated three-dimensional CNSs using ferrocene,
thiophene, and ethanol by the CVD method; their sponges were superlight
and superhydrophobic with outstanding electrical conductivity and
reversible compressibility.

Zhao et al.27 synthesized CNSs by the
CVD method using ferrocene, toluene, triethylborane, thiophene, and
pyridine as precursors. They produced nitrogen- and boron-doped carbon
sponges and found that the concentration of thiophene controlled the
average diameter of carbon nanotubes. Hashim et al.28 produced boron-doped CNSs using toluene, ferrocene, and
triethylborane by the CVD method. Carbon sponges can also be fabricated
using gas precursors. For instance, Erbay et al.19 synthesized CNSs using ethylene gas and ferrocene. They
used the CNSs as an anode in microbial fuel cells, generating a high
power density of ∼2100 Wm–3 per anode volume.

It has already been proved that alcohols are excellent precursors
for the synthesis of single-walled and multiwalled carbon nanotubes
by the CVD method: methanol,29,30 ethanol,31−36 methanol/ethanol mixtures,34 isopropanol,35 and hexanol.35 Recently,
alcohols have also been used to produce CNSs, for example, ethanol2,36 and ethanol–acetone solutions.37 The chemical species arising by the thermal decomposition of alcohols
provide possible routes for the growth of N-CNSs in an aerosol-assisted
chemical vapor deposition (AACVD) experiment.37 In this work, we focus our investigation on the use of isopropanol
as a carbon precursor. The chemical species arising during its particular
thermal decomposition (propylene and water)38 offers insights into the formation of novel carbon nanostructures
with interesting physical–chemical properties. Furthermore,
the thermal decomposition of propylene produces ethylene and methylene.39 Ethylene is an excellent precursor for the synthesis
of carbon nanotubes in conjunction with water,40−42 and methylene
is a very reactive chemical species, which could favor the size increment
of carbon chains or rings.43

In this
article, we report the use of isopropanol-based mixture
and benzylamine as precursors to produce nitrogen-doped CNSs (N-CNSs)
by the AACVD method. We demonstrated that isopropanol yields entangled
carbon nanotubes with nitrogen and oxygen functional groups on their
surface. We have also investigated the role of other alcohols (solutions
containing isopropanol–ethanol and isopropanol–acetone)
on the morphology, chemical surface, and absorption properties of
carbon sponges. We discuss the magnetic properties and electrochemical
activity of carbon sponges. Our results demonstrated that N-CNSs synthesized
with isopropanol have high oxygen concentration at their surface with
outstanding anodic and cathodic currents with potential applications
in energy storage devices.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 displays
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images for samples S1, S2, and
S3. The sponges contain complex entangled carbon fibers making knots
and junctions (see yellow arrows). The carbon fibers showed straight
and curly morphologies indicated by white arrows. Predominantly, the
straight fibers were thinner than curly fibers. Sample S3 displayed
the thinnest straight fibers (Figure 1e) with a diameter of up to 80 nm. Backscattered electrons
and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) images of S1, S2, and S3
are displayed in Figure SI-1, revealing
that all samples contain mainly C, O, and Fe. Figure SI-2 shows the diameter distribution plots for S1,
S2, and S3. Sample S2 displayed the largest average diameter (514.2
nm), followed by S1 (443.8 nm), and finally S3 with two modal curves
with a smaller mean diameter (160.96 and 284.06 nm). Concerning yield
production, we collected 8.80, 5.88, and 15.71 g for S1, S2, and S3,
respectively. Therefore, the solution S-IA (isopropanol–acetone
1:1) is an efficient precursor to increase the yield production. Recently,
we reported that the ethanol–acetone 1:1 solution as a precursor
in an AACVD experiment also increases the yield production.37 The chemical species released during the thermal
decomposition of isopropanol, ethanol, and acetone could give insights
into the growth mechanism of carbon fibers that constitute the N-CNS.
The thermal decomposition of isopropanol releases propylene and water,38 ethanol releases ethylene and water,44 and acetone releases methyls and carbon monoxide.45 The thermal decomposition of propylene releases
ethylene and methylene.39 Previous studies
have reported that water-assisted CVD favors the activity and lifetime
of the catalysts,42 while carbon monoxide
promotes an increase in the yield production of carbon nanotubes.46 Ethylene is also an efficient precursor to fabricate
carbon nanotubes.40,41 The considerable resemblance
between carbon fibers of S1 and S2 is observed because isopropanol
and ethanol molecules release ethylene and water during their thermal
decomposition. The increment in the yield production in S3 could be
due to the carbon monoxide released by the acetone. Besides, we observe
that N-CNSs displayed hydrophobicity. A drop of water on the surface
of S1 showed a quasi-spherical shape (see Figure SI-3). The real origin of the hydrophobicity of carbon sponge
materials is a subject far from being clear, but the surface roughness
and surface chemistry could be the keys to explain the hydrophobicity
of carbon sponges. The interface between the drop of water and sponge
could contain air bubbles because of the roughness of the sponge’s
surface,47 and on the other hand, nonpolar
functional groups anchored on the sponge’s surface may repel
water.48 Therefore, the surface chemistry
characterizations by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) could give us some insights
into the nature of chemical species hosted on the surface of N-CNSs.
We quantify the oxygen and nitrogen functional groups anchored on
the surface of N-CNS. Functional groups with a hydrophobic feature
such as ether groups (epoxy, methoxy, ethoxy, among others) could
be the key to elucidate the possible scenarios of the hydrophobic
property of N-CNSs, results are shown later.

Figures 2–4 depict
the transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) images for S1, S2, and S3. Figure 2a shows the straight and curved carbon fiber,
and a close-up image revealed clearly the curved fiber with bamboo
segments and Fe-based nanoparticles inside (Figure 2b). Figure 2c depicts the HTERM image of multilayered straight
carbon nanotubes with an interlayer distance of 0.341 nm. The interlayer
distance reported for carbon fiber with a turbostratic-type structure
is 0.344 nm.49 The core material of carbon
nanotube showed well-aligned graphitic layers, whereas the outer more
layers exhibited defected graphitic materials. Figure 3a,b depicts carbon fibers with different
diameters in the absence of bamboo-shaped morphology. Figure 3c displays Fe-based nanoparticles
inside the carbon fiber. An HRTEM image from S2 revealed an interlayer
distance of 3.41 Å (Figure 3d). The carbon fiber showed a bamboo-shaped morphology,
see Figure 4a,b. The
interlayer distance depended strongly on the carbon fiber zone, the
two zones analyzed yielded 3.35 and 3.47 Å, see Figure 4c,d.

nanotube showing the graphitic layers in different zones.

Figure 5a–c
displays the X-ray diffraction (XRD) plots showing the C(002) peaks,
characteristic of graphitic materials. These peaks showed an asymmetry
shape, which could be attributed to the existence of an expanded graphitic
material (EGM). The asymmetric peaks were deconvoluted in two pseudo-Voigt
curves and labeled γ- and π-curves, and Table SI-1 (Supporting Information) displays the details
about the deconvolution analysis. The γ- and π-peak centers
provide dγ and dπ interlayer distances, respectively,
where dγ is attributed to the EGM while dπ refers to a
well-ordered graphitic material. From this deconvolution analysis,
the amount of EGM in N-CNSs exceeded 67%, reaching 81% for sample
S1. Figure 5d depicts
the XRD plot for 2θ = 31–90°, revealing the presence
of peaks around 2θ = 44 and 54°; however, these are not
well defined. The presence of these unclear peaks is related to the
small Fe-based nanoparticles. Figure 6 shows the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements
for samples S1, S2, and S3. The TGA curves displayed two oxidative
temperatures (T1 and T2), indicating the presence of two different carbon materials
as also confirmed by the XRD characterizations. From TGA, it is clear
that the three types of synthesized N-CNSs display different thermal
stabilities, and those synthesized with isopropanol–acetone
were the least thermally stable. In all cases, the remaining or residual
materials were less than 0.5%.

deconvolution analysis. (d) XRD plots for 2θ = 31–90°,
revealing the presence of iron-based nanoparticles, mainly Fe3C (PDF 00-034-0001) and graphite (PDF 03-065-6212).

(isopropanol–ethanol), and S3 (isopropanol–acetone).
Sample S1 showed the lowest oxidation temperature likely because of
the small diameter of the carbon fiber.

Figure 7a displays
the Raman spectroscopy analysis for N-CNSs. Here, the vertical lines
correspond to the D- and G-peak bands, typical vibrational modes of
graphite (D = 1350 cm–1 and G = 1580 cm–1).50,51 The carbon sponges showed downshifts of
∼7 cm–1 and ∼23 cm–1 for D- and G-bands, respectively. Notice that the ratio between
the intensities of D- and G-peaks (ID/IG) provides information on the graphitization
degree, and higher values of ID/IG indicate poor graphitization. We found that ID/IG is 0.80, 0.88,
and 0.86 for samples S1, S2, S3, respectively. Therefore, samples
synthesized with isopropanol–acetone or isopropanol–ethanol
are less graphitic than those synthesized using only isopropanol.
Deconvolution analysis of D- and G-peaks allows us to elucidate the
different carbon species involved in the carbon sponges. We used four
Lorentzian curves to fit the profile peaks. Figure 7b–d displays the fitting of the peak
profile for the D- and G-peaks. The Lorentzian curves were labeled
D1-, D-, D2-, and G-peaks, and the results of the deconvolution are
summarized in Table SI-2 (Supporting Information). The D1-peak is a signal attributed to graphite edges.52,53 The D-peak corresponds to defects inside the carbon network, such
as vacancies, doping, or nonhexagonal carbon rings.54 The presence of the D2-peak could be assigned to C–C
vibration modes of olefinic sp2 groups, centered at ∼1510
cm–1, as was reported by Ferrari and Robertson.55

(D1, D, D2, and G). Table SI-2 displays
the data from the deconvolution analysis.

The N-CNSs were characterized by XPS, revealing the presence C,
N, O, and Si (see Figure SI-4). Interesting
trends on the concentration of the involved chemical element were
identified. The presence of silicon in the samples is attributed to
the quartz tube where N-CNSs were grown. Usually, the N-CNSs displayed
a high oxygen concentration above 5.4%. The N-CNSs synthesized with
only isopropanol (sample S1) exhibited the highest oxygen concentration
(9.2%). It is worth mentioning that oxygen abundance could be advantageous
for many chemical applications.56,57Figures 8–10 display the deconvoluted high-resolution C 1s, N 1s, and
O 1s peaks. The percentage of a chemical species can be estimated
from the area under its corresponding curve in the deconvolution analysis.
However, a pondered area (relative atomic ratio) by the atomic concentration
derived from XPS survey provides a better estimation of the chemical
groups involved in the entire sample. Tables SI-3–5 show the data on each curve, such as center, full width at half-maximum,
area, and relative atomic ratio. For C 1s peaks, chemical species
such as C–C, C=C, Fe–C, Si–C, C=O,
and O–C=O were identified, see Figure 8a–c. Figure 8d displays the relative atomic ratios of
carbon species for S1, S2, and S3. This estimation revealed that the
surface chemistry is mainly dominated by C–C and C=C
bonds, which are related to sp3- and sp2-hybridized
carbons, respectively. The highest percentage of sp3 has
been found for sample S3, which is related to carbon atoms linked
to different chemical species, maybe due to the functional groups
attached to carbon atoms placed at graphite edges or the defected
graphitic material. Raman characterizations revealed a well-defined
D1 peak assigned to the defected graphitic material in sample S3 (edges,
vacancies, and doping). Figure 9 displays the results for the high-resolution O 1s peaks.
It has been found that C–O, O–C=O, C=O,
and COOH species dominate the surface chemistry, which is assigned
to ether, ester, quinone, and carboxylic functional groups, respectively.
Because the N-CNSs are hydrophobic, the C–O bond could be attributed
to epoxy, methoxy, and ethoxy functional groups, whereas O–C=O
is related to ethyl–ester functional group. The N-CNS surface
rich in these functional groups would promote a hydrophobic surface
as a result of a steric impediment. Notice that all these groups containing
methyl groups in their tail are hydrophobic. However, more investigation
is needed to elucidate the chemical functional groups involved at
the surface of N-CNSs. The relative atomic ratio (%) of these functional
groups is displayed in Figure 9d. High-resolution deconvoluted N 1s peaks are shown in Figure 10. The relative
atomic ratio of different nitrogen species can be seen in Figure 10d. In all samples,
we found N-pyridinic, N-pyrrolic, N-quaternary, and pyridinic N-oxide
species. Sample S3 showed the highest values for almost all nitrogen
species. We also performed FTIR characterizations of N-CNSs (Figure 11). The vibration
modes corresponding to C=C sp2 ≈ 1650 cm–1 (graphitic material) were detected. The aliphatic
CH2 ∼1450 cm–1 and CH3 ∼1390 cm–1 were also present. The vibrational
modes of C=O bonds related to ester functional groups appeared
at ∼1749 cm–1. The nitrogen bond signals
for C=N at 2055 cm–1 and N=O 2313
cm–1 were also identified, besides the fact that
the vibrational modes of N–H of amine groups are present at
3750 cm–1. Table SI-6 displays the vibrational models for the different bonds illustrated
in FTIR spectra.

with only isopropanol showed a high percentage of ether group, which
could be assigned to epoxy, methoxy, and ethoxy functional groups.
Also, sample S1 exhibited the highest values of C=O and COOH
attributed to quinone and carboxylic groups.

ratio for N-pyridinic, N-pyrrolic, and N-quaternary doping.

The signal of C–O–C at 1055 cm–1 is
identified only for S1 and S2 samples.

The absorption properties were measured for gasoline, methanol,
diesel, vacuum oil, vegetable oil, ethylene glycol, and dichlorobenzene.
For each solvent and type of N-CNSs, a piece of ∼1 cm length
(Figure 12a) was selected,
which was immersed for 5 min, see Figure 12b,c. Subsequently, the N-CNS was taken out
from the solvent and immediately weighed. Finally, the N-CNS was burnt
to remove the organic solvent (see Figure 12d). The weight after burning was compared
with the initial weight (before the immersion); it was found that
these values were similar. Then, the same sponge was reused, yielding
similar values of the absorption capacity for that obtained for the
pristine sponge. Figure 12e–g displays the absorption capacity (Q) for S1, S2, and S3. The highest values of Q were
obtained for S1, followed by S2 and S3. This trend could be explained
in terms of surface chemistry.49 From XPS
characterizations, S1 showed the highest oxygen concentration with
a significant contribution of methoxy, ethoxy, and ester functional
groups. The high concentration of these groups with a methyl tail
makes sample S1 efficient for the absorption of organic solvents.
Because S2 and S3 revealed a similar oxygen concentration according
to XPS characterizations, one would expect similar absorption properties;
however, S2 was better than S3. This fact could be likely due to the
higher presence of ester functional groups in S2 (see Figure 9d). The values of Q obtained for our sponges are competitive with other CNSs synthesized
using other alcohol precursors in a CVD experiment.2,36,37 However, these are an order of magnitude
less than those CNSs produced using dichlorobenzene as a precursor.1

for
5 min and is subsequently burnt to remove the solvent. The burnt sponge
is reusable. The absorption capacity (Q) was obtained from Q = Qf/Q0. (e–g) Values of Q as a function
of solvent density.

Figure 13a–c
shows the results of cyclic voltammetry for N-CNSs, revealing a well-defined
redox process. The peak position, peak shape, and peak intensity of
the anodic and cathodic currents depended on the type of N-CNSs, see Table 2. The anodic and cathodic current intensities were higher for S1
than for S3 and S2 regardless of the scan rate (Figure SI-5). This fact could be related to the high quinone,
carboxylic, and ester functional group concentrations displayed by
sample S1. In Figure 14, we proposed a possible mechanism in the redox process involving
the quinone, carboxylic, and ethyl–ester functional groups. Table 2 displays the potential
difference between the anodic and cathodic peaks (ΔEp). As it is expected, ΔEp increases as the scan rate increases, and it was observed that ΔEp(S1) > ΔEp(S3) > ΔEp(S2). Similarly, the
intensity of the anodic current shows the following behavior Ia(S1)
> Ia(S3) > Ia(S2). The different behavior observed for ΔEp and Ia could be qualitatively understood in
terms of the percentage estimation of functional groups involved in
the surface of N-CNSs. The high concentration of quinone and carboxylic
groups in S1 could be responsible for the high value of Ia where the
redox process could be carried out via quinone, carboxylic, and ethyl–ester
groups. Notice that a low relative atomic ratio of quinone and carboxylic
groups in S2 originated low Ia values. Furthermore, the low values
of ΔEp in S2 could be correlated
with the high concentration of pyridinic N-oxide. From electrochemical
measurements, it is clear that the surface chemistry is different
in all N-CNSs as also demonstrated by XPS characterizations.

Figure 15 depicts
the magnetic hysteresis loops for N-CNSs at room temperature (300
K). Results showed that the N-CNSs exhibit a ferromagnetic behavior
because of the iron-based catalytic particle inside the graphitic
material. The magnetization measurements were carried out in a field
range of ±20 kOe. Magnetic hysteresis loops are shown in the
range of ±8 kOe for better visualization. The corresponding saturation
magnetization (Ms), coercive field (Hc), and remanence (Mr) are indicated. Ms was sensitive to
the type of N-CNSs, and their values were below 6 × 10–4 emu. Sample S1 revealed the most significant values of Ms, followed by sample S3. Hc reached values up to ∼0.29 kOe slightly higher than those
found for α-Fe or Fe3C nanoparticles inside multiwalled
carbon nanotubes.58−60 Previous results on the magnetic properties of carbon
nanotubes with Fe2O3 (maghemite) and Fe3C (cementite) inside reported an Ms of 5 emu/g and an Hc of ∼500
Oe.61 The ferromagnetism displayed by N-CNSs
could be useful for several applications such as magnetic sensor devices,
stem cell transplantation, and magnetic fluid hyperthermia.

3 Conclusions
We have
fabricated N-CNSs by AACVD method using isopropanol-based
mixture, benzylamine, ferrocene, and thiophene as precursors. We used
isopropanol-based mixture as precursors: isopropanol, isopropanol–ethanol
(1:1), and isopropanol–acetone (1:1). On the basis of our investigations,
we remark five crucial points: (1) According to the XPS characterizations,
the N-CNSs synthesized using only isopropanol displayed a superoxygenated
sponge. (2) The N-CNSs produced with isopropanol revealed a high concentration
of ether groups (C–O), which could be attributed to methoxy,
ethoxy, phenols, epoxy, and possibly to complex oxygenated large carbon
chains anchored on the surface of carbon sponge. (3) The N-CNSs produced
using only isopropanol displayed the highest anodic and cathodic currents,
confirming the importance of oxygen functionalization in the electroactivity
of graphitic materials. (4) The surface chemistry of our sponges was
explored and correlated with the chemical–physical properties
such as hydrophobicity, electroactivity, and absorption capacity.
(5) Our work provides an alternative route to synthesize in situ functionalized
graphitic materials. In most cases, the oxygen functionalization of
carbon material requires aggressive acid treatments per hour and tedious
and long-time consumer methods to remove the acidity. Magnetic measurements
at room temperature revealed that N-CNSs are ferromagnetic with high
coercive fields. In summary, we have synthesized multifunctional materials
with outstanding superhydrophobic, oil-absorbent, electroactive, and
ferromagnetic properties. We envisage that our N-CNSs could be applied
in lithium-ion batteries, oil removal in spills, magnetic sensors,
among others. However, more surface chemistry and applications of
N-CNSs deserve to be more deeply investigated.

4 Experimental
Details
The N-CNSs were produced using a modified AACVD method,
as was
used elsewhere.36,37Figure SI-6 (Supporting Information) displays a schematic representation
of the experimental setup. Briefly, the AACVD system consists of two
independent sprayers (sprayer-A and sprayer-B) connected by a Y-glass
adapter to a quartz tube (length: 90 cm; diameter: 2.5 cm) placed
inside a tubular furnace (Barnstead Thermolyne Mod. F21135). The quartz
tube is connected to a condenser and an acetone trap for residuals.
A solution made of benzylamine (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.00%), ferrocene
(Sigma-Aldrich, 98.00%), and thiophene (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.00%) is
fixed in sprayer-A, whereas another solution containing isopropanol-based
mixture, ferrocene, and thiophene is set in sprayer-B. In this case,
three different solutions were considered: (i) isopropanol only (CTR
Scientific, 99.50%), (ii) isopropanol–ethanol 1:1 (CTR Scientific,
96.50%), and (iii) isopropanol–acetone 1:1 (CTR Scientific,
99.95%). The solution in sprayer-A was named S-BFT. The solutions
used in sprayer-B were named S-I (containing only isopropanol), S-IE
(containing isopropanol and ethanol), and S-IA (containing isopropanol
and acetone). Table 1 summarizes the chemical precursors and concentrations used in each
experiment. Thus, N-CNSs labeled S1, S2, and S3 were produced using
S-I, S-IE, and S-IA, respectively. The nebulized precursors formed
inside the sprayers were transported to the quartz tube reactor by
two different gas flows. In sprayer-A, a mixture of Ar/H2 (Infra, 95/5%) at 1.0 L/min was employed. In sprayer-B, the gas
used was Ar (Infra, 99.999%) at 0.8 L/min. The temperature of synthesis
was 1020 °C for 4 h. The CNS-type nanomaterial obtained was collected
inside the quartz tube using a stained steel rod. Samples grown in
the central part of the tubular furnace were characterized by SEM
(FEI-Helios NanoLab DualBeam 600 Microscopy), HRTEM (FEI Tecnai F30),
Raman spectroscopy (Micro-Raman Renishaw) using a power laser beam
of 532 nm (2.33 eV), TGA (STA 6000 PerkinElmer), XRD (SmartLab X-ray
Diffractometer, Rigaku, Co.) using a power source of Cu (Kα
= 1.54 Å), and XPS (PHI 5000 VersaProbe II). For FTIR characterizations,
the samples were prepared with KBr (Sigma-Aldrich, FT-IR grade ≥99%).
An equivalent weight of 0.2% of N-CNSs deposited in an agate mortar
was milled, and then an equivalent weight of 99.8% of KBr was added
and incorporated using the agate pestle. The FTIR spectra were collected
by Thermo-Fisher Nicolet 6700 equipment at 128 scan with an attenuated
total reflection tip. The adsorption test of oil and organic solvents
was realized by weighing an N-CNS (S = 1–3) sample (Q0), the sample was immersed in oil or organic
solvent for 5 min, then the sample was put in a wax paper for few
seconds to clean the excess of solvent, and then the sponge was weighed
again (Qf). The absorption capacity was
defined using the next relation Q = Qf/Q0, where Q is the capacity of absorption expressed as a dimensionless quantity.
Cycles of voltammetry of N-CNSs were measured with varying scan rates
(10, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 600 mV/s) with a potential window of −0.8–1.2
V using VSP 300 multichannel potentiostat (BioLogic Science Instrument).
An Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl reference electrode (Mod RE 1-CP) and the
counter electrode of platinum were used. The working electrode was
prepared using a 904L stainless steel wire mesh (50 mesh, Hebei Hao
Cheng Metal Wire Mesh). A sample of CNS with ∼1.0 cm2 of the area was held using the wire mesh. Finally, the reference,
counter, and working electrodes were immersed in sulfuric acid (0.5
M) as electrolyte (pH = 0.5) at room temperature. Magnetic characterization
of the CNSs was done using a physical property measurement system
(DynaCool, Quantum Design). The magnetic hysteresis loops were measured
at room temperature (300 K), and the magnetic fields were in the range
of ±20 kOe.
