The
structural changes in the guest
platinum(II)tetraammine complex due to the steric and electronic interactions
with the host zeolite frameworks LTL, MWW, and Y have been investigated
using density functional theory calculations. It is observed that
the square planar geometry of platinum(II)tetraammine complex has
been distorted to nonplanar geometry when encapsulated in supercages
of zeolite framework. The distortion is found to be higher in LTL
than that in Y and MWW frameworks, without affecting the nature of
the zeolite framework. Geometrical parameters, highest occupied molecular
orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energies, global hardness,
and softness were calculated to understand the distortion in the pores
of the zeolite matrix. The most plausible active site of the complex
was identified using the Fukui functions.

Introduction
Zeolite-encapsulated
transition-metal complexes are interesting
candidates for catalysis as their features are analogous to homogeneous
and heterogeneous catalytic systems. They create a unique environment
by posing steric and electrostatic constraints on voids and walls.
These constraints determine the changes in the structural, electronic,
redox, and magnetic properties of the encapsulated complexes, thereby
contributing to the reactivity of the encapsulated complex.1−12 Zeolite framework has a porous structure that can accommodate a
wide range of cations, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and others. These cations can readily
be exchanged by the incoming cations. Exchanged cation plays a major
role in compensating the negative charge and increasing electropositivity
thereby strengthening the zeolite framework. It controls the space
availability and offers various reactive sites for the guest molecules
to interact.13,14

Bulk transition-metal oxides
or on nonacid support were utilized
as the first-generation catalysts, which were developed for the alkanes
aromatization. Among metal oxides, Cr2O3-based
materials show interesting catalytic properties. In spite of their
high selectivity, low activity, and fast deactivation, transition-metal
oxides have paved the way for discovery of catalysts based on supported
noble metals, which comprise second-generation catalyst. Generally,
noble metal-supported catalysts are highly active for dehydrogenation
of alkanes and hydrogenolysis reactions. However, the drawback of
noble metal-supported acidic supports favors the formation of aliphatic
hydrocarbons (light alkanes, isoparaffins, alkyl cyclopentanes, and
alkyl benzenes) than aromatic hydrocarbon. The selectivity toward
aromatic hydrocarbon strongly depends on metal dispersion, alloying,
passivation of metals due to carbon and/or sulfur deposition, acidic
properties of the support, temperature, and pressure (hydrogen and
alkane). Among the noble metals, Pt has been found to be the best
candidate as it possesses excellent catalytic behavior adaptable/stable
with solid support.15

Pt clusters
(5–12 atoms) supported on basic zeolite (LTL)
are found to be highly selective toward dehydrocyclization of alkanes.
The reason for higher selectivity is still an unsolved mystery. It
could be due to alternating of the redox potential because of confinement
or due to the creation of active centers for the adsorption of substrates
undergoing reactions. There are few speculations over the selectivity
such as nonacidic nature of the support and monofunctional catalyst
with platinum, which can provide catalytic sites.16,17 Miller et al. have proposed that cluster size plays an important
role along with the presence of a nonacidic support. Furthermore,
they reported that the geometry of the LTL zeolite pores is mainly
responsible for the adsorption of n-hexane such that
they are aligned inside the pore in a special manner, which favors
1–6 ring closure in the alkane.18,19 To resolve
the mystery, the present work describes the theoretical investigation
of tetraammineplatinum(II) complex encapsulated in various zeolites,
such as zeolite Y, MWW, and LTL, and their catalytic activities were
reasoned using density functional theory (DFT) studies.

Results and Discussion
Ground
State Geometries
The optimized geometries of
the neat and zeolite-encapsulated platinum(II)tetraammine complex
are shown in Figure 1. The selected geometric parameters of the optimized neat complex
and the zeolite-encapsulated complex from B3LYP/LANL2DZ level calculations
are tabulated in Table 1.

Figure 1 Optimized geometries of the neat (a) [Pt(NH3)4]2+ and encapsulated (b) [Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL, (c) [Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW, and (d) [Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y complexes.

The geometrical parameters of the neat complex have been compared
with the encapsulated complexes. The optimized geometry of the neat
complex has equal Pt–N bond length. The bond angles of N1–Pt–N3,
N1–Pt–N2, N2–Pt–N4, and N3–Pt–N4
strongly confirm the square planar geometry. After encapsulating in
LTL, MWW, and Y zeolites, Pt–N bond lengths and bond angles
vary. Among the three encapsulated complexes, the LTL zeolite experienced
more deviation due to the pore size. These observations support the
experimental results reported by Miller et al.18

Table 1 reports
the differences in bond length and bond angles of the neat and encapsulated
complexes. The covalent character is proven by quantum chemical calculations
of Si–O bonds in zeolites.28 Partially
delocalized electronic clouds, which are contributed by valence electrons,
are seen all over the framework of the zeolite. At short distances,
the electron–electron repulsions will be operative between
the complex molecule and the walls of cavities present in the zeolite,
resulting in deviations in bond lengths.

Frontier Molecular Orbital
Analysis
The highest occupied
molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO)
energies of the neat and encapsulated complexes are represented in Figure 2. The HOMO energies
are in the order of [Pt(NH3)4]2+ <
[Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y < [Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL < [Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW and those of LUMOs are in
the order of [Pt(NH3)4]2+ < [Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y < [Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW < [Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL. It can be observed from Figure 2 that the HOMO and
LUMO energies of encapsulated complexes become destabilized. The energies
of the frontier orbital of the metal complexes get changed upon encapsulation,
leading to a small HOMO–LUMO gap. These changes may be due
to (i) the effect of the counterion (two Al atoms in zeolite) and
(ii) the steric constraint imparted by the zeolite matrix. When a
guest molecule is confined inside zeolite, few types of interaction
are considered, such as Coulombic effects, coordination effects, van
der Waals interactions, and double-layer effects.29,30 These effects alter the energy levels including the metal complex
chemical behavior.

Figure 2 Pictorial representation of the HOMO and LUMO levels of
the neat
and encapsulated complexes.

The percentages of orbital contribution to each atomic orbital,
viz., HOMO and LUMO are given in Table S1. The main contribution to HOMO is from s (15%) and d (85%) orbitals
of platinum and to LUMO is only from d orbital of platinum. After
encapsulation, the main contribution to HOMO is from s and p orbitals
of aluminum and p and s orbitals of oxygen, which are present in the
zeolite matrix. The contribution to LUMO is mainly from d orbital
of platinum, and a small quantity is contributed by the p orbital
of nitrogen; but in the case of zeolite Y-encapsulated complex, the
LUMO is coming only from the d orbital of platinum. This shows that
the metal complex molecular orbital cannot extend over the entire
space and restricts within the dimension of the zeolite cage. Upon
substitution of aluminum in zeolite matrix, both HOMO and LUMO levels
of platinum(II)tetraammine are stabilized. The electrostatic potential
generated inside the cage changed by the presence of Brønsted
sites.

The compositions of HOMO and LUMO considering the metal
complex
and zeolite as two segments are calculated and listed in Table S2. As apparent from the MO diagram of
[Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL, the contributions
of the [Pt(NH3)4]2+ and LTL group
are around 1.58 and 98.42%, respectively, toward HOMO, whereas LUMO
is mainly constituted by metal complex (87%) and zeolite (13%). The
HOMO of [Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW and
[Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y is composed
largely of zeolite, and LUMO is stabilized with the contributions
from metal complex.

Ionization Potential (IP), Electron Affinity
(EA), and Binding
Energy
The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity
(EA) values for all of the complexes are calculated and tabulated
in Table 2. The values
of the ionization potential (IP) of the encapsulated complexes are
less than those of the neat complex. This indicates that the encapsulated
complexes will act as a better oxidizing agent. This study reports
the calculated interaction energy of the encapsulated complexes as
the energy differences between the optimized encapsulated complexes
and the corresponding fragments (the neat complex and the zeolite).
The calculated interaction energies can be ordered as [Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL (−22.87 eV) > [Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y (−22.23 eV) >
[Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW (−21.27
eV), which indicates that the LTL complex interacts more strongly
and is stable than the other two complexes. This interaction energy
differences can be attributed to changes in the geometrical parameters.

Global and Local Descriptors
The
global and local descriptor’s
calculations have been performed as reported by Deka et al.1,2 Deka et al.2 have done calculations on
the neat complexes, such as [Fe(Phen)3]2+, [Cu(Phen)3]2+, and [Zn(Phen)3]2+, and
their corresponding encapsulated complexes defined as Fe–PhenY,
Cu–PhenY, and Zn–PhenY, and their results are given
in Table 3. Table 3 reports the chemical
hardness (η), the chemical potential (μ), and the electrophilicity
index (ω) values computed using B3LYP/LANL2DZ for the neat and
encapsulated complexes. The global hardness of [Pt(NH3)4]2+–LTL is lower in comparison to [Pt(NH3)4]2+–MWW and [Pt(NH3)4]2+–Y, whereas it has higher global
softness (S) than the other two encapsulated complexes.
The maximum hardness and the minimum polarizability principle31−36 state that “hardness measures the stability and softness
(polarizability) measures the reactivity”. Following the stated
principle, [Pt(NH3)4]2+ encapsulated
in LTL zeolite shows higher reactivity with maximum softness and minimum
hardness, which makes this complex a better catalyst in comparison
with other complexes reported in this article.

Tables S3–S5 present the Fukui
functions (FFs, fk+ and fk–), local softness (Sk+ and Sk–), and electrophilicity index (ωk+ and ωk+) of the selected atoms calculated using Hirshfeld
population analysis scheme. The fk–, Sk–, and ωk– values are analyzed
in the context of an electrophilic attack, and the larger values of fk–, Sk–, and
ωk– correspond to the most evident reaction site available
for receiving an electrophile. It is observed from Tables S3–S5, upon encapsulation, the values of the
FFs at the metal centers decrease. Reported calculations37−39 have shown that a minimum Fukui function site is preferred for hard–hard
interactions and maximum for soft–soft interactions. However,
upon encapsulation, the value of fk– is changed
with the metal ion having the most +ve value of fk–. The values of fk–, Sk–, and ωk– suggest that
encapsulation alters the reaction site.

Natural Population Analysis
(NPA)
The results of the
NPA analysis are given in Table 4. The NPA charge of Pt in the neat complex is +0.604,
whereas it has decreased in the zeolite system. The charge of nitrogen
atoms in the neat complex is −1.029, which shows the compensation
between the complex and surrounding zeolite matrix. The interaction
energies between the complex and zeolite were found to be −22.87,
−21.27, and −22.23 kcal/mol for LTL-, MWW-, and Y-encapsulated
complexes, respectively. It is noteworthy that the interaction energies
with the amount of charge transfer between M+ and the zeolite
framework were revealed by the charge reduction of the metal cation.

Conclusions
Density
functional theory (B3LYP/LANLD2Z) studies report the influence
of different zeolites on platinum(II)tetraammine complex. Three different
frameworks, such as LTL, MWW, and Y zeolites, were studied. The framework
of the LTL zeolite can stabilize the adsorption between the complex
and the cage. The interaction energy for LTL zeolite is −22.87
kcal/mol, which is higher than that for MWW (21.27 kcal/mol) and Y
(22.23 kcal/mol). Theoretical studies confirmed that the zeolite framework
walls enforce space constrain to the metal complexes, which modifies
their geometrical and catalytic behavior. The encapsulation changes
the value of redox potential, which in turn causes altered catalytic
behavior. Supporting Information is drawn
from DFT calculations, which shows the reduced distance between the
HOMO and LUMO levels that is influenced by space constraint and Coulombic
electrostatic field forced by the zeolite framework. On the whole,
DFT calculations report that encapsulation (i) reduces the global
hardness, (ii) increases the softness and (ii) the Fukui function
values of the complexes, leading to higher catalytic activity. Taking
the Fukui functions into account and evaluating the reactivity indexes,
we conclude that the platinum atom is the most prone site for the
attack of both nucleophile and electrophile.

Computational Details
All of the calculations were carried out using Gaussian 09 program
with B3LYP correlation functional using LANL2DZ basis set.20,21 Three different zeolite frameworks (zeolite Y, MWW, and Linde type
L) were created by taking 40 tetrahedral units (40T), where the supercage
was saturated with hydrogens. First, crystallographic positions of
Si and O atoms of the clusters were fixed and the positions of terminal
H atoms were optimized. Following Lowenstein’s rule, two aluminum
atoms were replaced in the position of two silicon atoms in the six-member
ring to compensate two +ve charges of the complexes. The gas-phase-optimized
Pt complex is then encapsulated inside the supercage. All geometric
optimizations were performed without point group constraints.

The chemical potential (μ) and global hardness (η)
can be expressed by Koopman’s theorem22 as 1   2  where ELUMO is
the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital and EHOMO is the energy of the highest occupied molecular
orbital.

The ionization potential (IP) and electron affinity
(EA) of the
system defined by the finite difference approximation are as follows.23 3   4  where EN, EN–1, and EN+1 are the energies of the N, N – 1, and N + 1 electron
systems, respectively.

The global electrophilicity defined by
Parr et al.24 is given as 5  The global softness S is
defined as 6  The condensed Fukui function25 of an atom, k, in a molecule with N electrons is defined
by a finite difference approximation
as 7   8   9  where qk(N), qk(N +
1), and qk(N –
1) are the charges of the kth atom for the N, N + 1, and N –
1 electron systems, respectively.

Equations 1–6 were used
to calculate the global and local reactivity
descriptors. eqs 7 and 8 were used to calculate the Fukui functions (FFs, fk+ and fk–). The
local softness value of an atom k can be defined
as the product of the Fukui function, and the global softness and
the local softness values of selected atoms were calculated using eqs 10–12. 10   11   12  A generalized concept of philicity associated
with a site k in a molecule was defined by Chattaraj
et al.26 as below 13  where α = +, −, and 0 represent
nucleophilic, electrophilic, and radical attacks, respectively.

The charge distribution in the complexes has been analyzed via
the natural population analysis (NPA).27
