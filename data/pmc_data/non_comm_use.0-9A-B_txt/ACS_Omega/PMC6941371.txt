The Zr-, Ce-, Sr-, and Sn-promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts
were prepared by the incipient wetness impregnation method, then characterized
by N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, H2-TPR, CO2-TPD, UV–vis,
high-angle annular dark-field imaging–scanning transmission
electron microscopy—energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy elemental
mapping, Raman, and thermogravimetric techniques to study the structural
evolution under the preparation/reaction conditions, and applied to
catalyze ethane oxidative dehydrogenation with CO2. The
results suggested that the Cr6+ species were indispensable
for activating the dehydrogenation reaction thanks to the oxidation–reduction
cycle between Cr6+ and Cr3+. The type of the
promotor also affected significantly the ability of replenishing the
lattice oxygen through the disassociation of CO2, leading
to the different catalytic performances. The Zr-promoted sample had
the best performance in converting the reactants as well as the catalytic
stability.

1 Introduction
With the increase of population
in the world, the consumption of
fossil-based resources increases sharply. The emission of CO2 is accumulated in the atmosphere, and further enhances the “greenhouse
effect”.1,2 Therefore, a large number of endeavors
are paid to technologies including carbon dioxide capture, utilization,
and storage.3−6 On the other hand, the large-scale exploitation of shale gas, together
with the other unconventional natural gas sources, offers abundant
but cheap light alkanes mainly methane and ethane.7,8 Dry
reforming of methane is widely studied in recent years as it could
convert the two major greenhouse gases simultaneously into syngas
which could be subsequently applied to the Fischer–Tropsch
synthesis as raw materials. In the case of ethane, it supplies another
choice besides the dry reforming of ethane—oxidative dehydrogenation
of ethane for the production of ethylene using CO2 as a
soft oxidant. The oxidation process consumes greenhouse gas CO2 and produces the value-added ethylene from ethane. Ethylene
as a chemical building block could be used to synthesize various downstream
products such as polyethylene, polyvinylchloride, ethylene glycol,
styrene, acetic acid, vinyl acetate, ethanol, and so forth which are
applied to manufacture plastics, synthetic fibers, surfactants, paints,
solvents, and other fine chemicals.9

Both catalytic oxidative dehydrogenation and noncatalytic thermal
dehydrogenation could convert ethane to ethylene, and oxygen/air,
CO2, SO2, and N2O can act as oxidants
for the former process.10 However, the
use of oxygen/air leads to deep oxidation of ethane to give COx and water because of their strong oxidative
ability. SO2 and N2O are not as strong as oxygen/air
in their oxidative ability, but they may bring safety risks when operating.
CO2 seems to be a good candidate that has appropriate oxidative
ability and chemical inertness under ambient conditions. Moreover,
the reaction in the presence of CO2 takes place easily
compared to the noncatalytic thermal dehydrogenation process (eqs 1 and 2). In addition, it is helpful to remove the deposited coke through
reacting with CO2. 1   2  

Cr-based catalysts are widely applied
to catalyze oxidative dehydrogenation
of ethane with CO2 because the Cr element has a multioxidative
state, which is favorable to form the oxidation–reduction cycle
between the high and low chemical valents.11−14 Deng15 et al. synthesized the Cr/ZrO2 catalysts and introduced
Ni, Fe, Co, and Mn as promotors. It was found that the addition of
Fe, Co, and Mn could enhance the selectivity of ethylene, while the
sample modified by Ni promoted the side reaction like the reforming
reaction; as a result, CO was preferred to generate. Such a product
distribution was probably related to the strong ability of Ni in cleaving
C–C and C–H bonds. Similar results could be also observed
in the other Ni-contained catalysts such as PtNi-16,17 and FeNi-9,18,19 systems. The silica-based materials are most commonly used as supports.
The experimental results from Wang20 and
Baiker21 further confirmed that the support
SiO2 performed better than Al2O3,
ZrO2, TiO2, and even their composites with SiO2. The reported silica-based material-supported Cr catalysts
included Cr/MCM-41,22,23 (Cr-) Cr/MSU-x,24 Cr/ZSM-5,23,25 Cr/Zr-ZSM-5,14 and Cr/SAPO-34.26 Obviously, the research on the support effect
is very active for the Cr family catalysts, and the silica-based materials
attract most attention just because the appropriate properties of
the catalyst such as the dispersion of Cr species, redox and acid–base
which are favorable for ethane dehydrogenation with CO2 could be obtained. However, the publications on the promotor effect
of Cr-based catalysts are limited.

Therefore, the present work
would focus on the promotor effect
of the Cr-based catalyst where a commercial SiO2 is chosen
as the support, and the metal elements including Zr, Ce, Sr, and Sn
would be introduced into the base sample Cr/SiO2 as promotors
because: (i) the introduction of ZrO2 can improve the acid–base
and redox properties, generate abundant oxygen vacancies;14,15,27 (ii) CeO2 shows very
strong capacity in oxygen storage, release, and transport;28−30 (iii) Sr could be incorporated into the catalyst matrix and thus
modify the acid–base property. The deep oxidation of ethane
is expected to be limited;31,32 (iv) the existence
of Sn can restrict the side reactions, and improve the coke resistance.32−34 This series of promoted catalysts is prepared by the conventional
incipient wetness impregnation (ICI) method, and characterized by
various techniques to obtain the physicochemical properties which
are further correlated with catalytic performances in dehydrogenation
of ethane in the presence of CO2.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Porosity
The textural properties
including the specific surface area, pore volume, and average pore
diameter were measured by N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms
which were depicted in Figure 1(l). All the samples showing the similar adsorption/desorption
behaviors as the type IV isotherms were obtained according to the
IUPAC classification,35 which was the characteristic
of mesoporous materials. The capillary condensation occurred between
0.65 and 0.95 of relative pressure, and therefore gave the type H2
hysteresis loop which was directly linked to the uniformity of the
pores. The pore size distribution also showed similar results (centered
at around 12 nm) as seen from Figure 1(r), suggesting that the microstructure was similarly
affected after loading 12 wt % metals on the support.

Figure 1 (l) N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms and (r) pore
size distribution of the catalysts (a) ZrCr/SiO2, (b) SrCr/SiO2, (c) SnCr/SiO2, (d) CeCr/SiO2, and
(e) Cr/SiO2.

More precise information could be obtained from
the quantified
results that were listed in Table 1. Comparing with the pristine SiO2 support,
the surface areas of supported catalysts decreased by from 25.8% for
CeCr/SiO2 to 33.7% for ZrCr/SiO2, both the values
were much bigger than the metal loading of 12 wt %, indicating that
pores were partially plugged by the metal species, which could be
further evidenced by the loss of the pore volume. On the other hand,
the average diameters of Zr-, Sr-, and Sn-promoted samples were identical
to ∼12.7 nm which was even bigger than that of the support.
Such a result was probably caused by plugging the pore with a smaller
diameter because a wide distribution between 3 and 30 nm could be
found for the support. The smaller average diameters of CeCr/SiO2 and Cr/SiO2 (∼9.9 nm for the both) may
imply better dispersion of metal species on the support.

2.2 Crystalline Phase
The X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results of the calcined samples are reported in Figure 2(l), the broad diffraction
peak at ∼22° was assigned to the amorphous SiO2 support. The evident diffractions from Cr2O3 could be found at 24.6, 33.6, 36.3, 41.5, 50.3, 54.9, 63.5, 65.2,
and 73.1° for all the samples. It was interesting to note that
the diffractions from the second metal species were hard to detect,
which may be caused by their quite low content and/or by well-dispersed
nanoparticles. The XRD patterns for the spent catalysts are depicted
in Figure 2(r), and
no obvious change was found except for the ZrCr/SiO2 sample
over which the quartz phase was detected, which was probably caused
by the residual quartz sand.

2.3 Surface Analysis
The chemical state
of surface elements was measured on both calcined and spent catalysts
by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) technique to explore
the possible evolution during the reaction, the Cr 2p3/2 XPS spectra are reported in Figure 3. Two isolated peaks were observed, corresponding to
the Cr species centered at ∼576.5 eV and its satellite peak
which usually appeared at the 9.3 eV higher binding energy side, centered
at ∼585.8 eV. The Cr species involved at least two types of
chemical states according to the deconvolution treatment, the peaks
at a binding energy of ∼576 and ∼580 eV were assigned
to Cr3+ and Cr6+,36 respectively. Besides these, another peak appeared at the lower
binding energy side (∼573 eV) for all the samples except ZrCr/SiO2, but its origin was really unclear, and the unknown Cr species
were denoted as Crx.

spectra for different samples BR and AR
(a) ZrCr/SiO2, (b) SrCr/SiO2, (c) SnCr/SiO2, (d) CeCr/SiO2, and (e) Cr/SiO2.

According to the quantification of surface composition
that was
listed in Table 2,
it could be found that the surface content of Cr was different, and
showed a decreasing order as: SnCr/SiO2 (1.3%) > Cr/SiO2 (1.1%) > CeCr/SiO2 (1.0%) > ZrCr/SiO2 (0.7%) > SrCr/SiO2 (0.6%). While for the promotor,
the
surface contents of Zr and Ce had the same values as that of the surface
Cr in corresponding samples, the surface content of Sn was about one-fourth
time as high as that of surface Cr. It was interesting to note that
no Sr was detected on the catalyst surface by XPS. As far as the chemical
state of the Cr species was concerned, the sample ZrCr/SiO2 showed the maximum proportion of Cr6+ (64.0%), and SrCr/SiO2 showed the minimum value of 1.3%. Compared to the unpromoted
Cr/SiO2, the content of Cr6+ species was higher
for Zr- and Sn-promoted catalysts, meaning that the Cr6+ species were easier to form during the calcination process. On the
contrary, the addition of Sr and Ce could stabilize the Cr3+ species.

Cr/SiO2	580.0	576.4	573.6	—/1.1/22.7/76.2	11.5/79.0/9.5	
The Cr 2p3/2 spectra had obvious changes,
the Cr3+ species became the majority in each sample because
of the
reduction by alkane during the reaction. Only quite small peaks assigned
to Cr6+ species could be seen for Cr/SiO2 and
CeCr/SiO2, and it disappeared completely for SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 samples, and a new shoulder at around
582 eV appeared instead, which could be also found for CeCr/SiO2. The quantified results in Table 3 exhibited that all Cr species existed as
Cr3+ (100%) in catalysts SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2. The Cr6+ species took up only 2.9 and 0.09% in
CeCr/SiO2 and Cr/SiO2, respectively. The Zr-promoted
ZrCr/SiO2 catalyst still involved the maximum of Cr6+ after the catalytic reaction, although a part of them was
converted into the ill-defined Crx species.
Another evident change was from the surface composition, the increase
of the Cr surface content indicated that the Cr species was enriched
under the reaction conditions, while the surface content of the promotors
did not show any specific trend. The Sr species that were found on
the surface of the calcined sample were detected in the spent one.
These results suggested that a dynamic surface existed during the
reaction which may be driven by the redox process.

The O 1s spectra for the catalysts before reaction
(BR) are shown
in Figure 4, and it
involved three types of oxygen species for all the samples as three
peaks could be obtained through deconvolution treatment. The one at
a lower binding energy of 531.5 eV was from the surface lattice oxygen
(OI), the one at a binding energy of ∼532.3 eV was
attributed to hydroxyl oxygen (OII), while the one at a
higher binding energy of ∼533.6 eV was assigned to the adsorbed
water species (OIII).37,38 It has been
reported that hydrogen could react with lattice oxygen to generate
M–OH and oxygen vacancies. Moreover, the charge balance was
kept by bonding the metal cations with OH groups.37 Obviously, the number of surface hydroxyl oxygen (OII) could reflect directly the quantity of oxygen vacancies.
The quantitative results in Table 4 show that the percentage of surface hydroxyl oxygen
followed the decreasing trend like: ZrCr/SiO2 (47.5%) >
CeCr/SiO2 (42.9%) > SnCr/SiO2 (38.3%) >
Cr/SiO2 (34.1%) > SrCr/SiO2 (33.9%). It suggested
that
a larger number of oxygen vacancies could be created when Cr was partially
substituted by Sn, Ce, and Zr.

The three types of oxygen still coexisted from the
O 1s spectra
for the catalysts after reaction (AR), while their proportions changed
according to the results in Table 5. The percentage of surface lattice oxygen decreased
by different extents except for ZrCr/SiO2 which showed
an increasing trend. The percentage of hydroxyl oxygen decreased for
all the catalysts; the extent followed the increasing order: SnCr/SiO2 (1.3%) < ZrCr/SiO2 (4.8%) < SrCr/SiO2 (11.2%) < Cr/SiO2 (24.9%) < CeCr/SiO2 (36.8%), meaning that the oxygen vacancies were lost during
the reaction, and different metal performed variously in retaining
the oxygen vacancies.

2.4 UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The chemical
state of Cr species in the calcined samples was further characterized
UV–vis spectroscopy, and the collected spectra were depicted
in Figure 5. Four bands
at around 270, 370, 460, and 600 nm could be observed for the all
samples. The bands at about 270 and 370 nm were attributed to the
O2– → Cr6+ charge transfer transition
of chromate species in tetrahedral coordination. While the presence
of bands at 460 and 600 nm confirmed the existence of Cr3+ species in Cr2O3 or CrOx cluster that was in octahedral coordination [13]. These results
were coincident with the findings by XPS, evidencing the coexistence
of Cr3+ and Cr6+ species in the calcined catalysts.
However, the latter one was not detected by XRD, which was probably
caused by its good dispersion.

catalysts (a) ZrCr/SiO2, (b) SrCr/SiO2, (c)
SnCr/SiO2, (d)
CeCr/SiO2, and (e) Cr/SiO2.

2.5 Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectra
for the calcined catalysts are reported in Figure 6(l), the bands at 300, 350, 395, 550, 600,
850, and 987 cm–1 could be found for all the samples,
they were assigned to the bending vibration mode of Cr–O–Cr,
Cr6+ species, the bending vibration mode of Cr6+–O in monochromate, Cr3+ species, stretching mode
of Cr–O–Cr, bridging mode of Cr–O–Cr,
and symmetric stretching mode of Cr=O in poly-chromates,39,40 respectively. The broad band centered at 987 cm–1 was probably related to the symmetric stretching mode of Cr=O
in some kind of chromates with a lower polymerization degree because
the Raman shifts of that in mono- and poly-chromates were 980 and
1010 cm–1,41,42 respectively. In addition,
an isolated band at 890 cm–1 could be observed for
the sample SrCr/SiO2, and it was overlapped for the rest.
The presence of it was resulted from the embedment of Cr mono–oxo
species into the defect sites of the catalyst framework.43 These Raman features not only confirmed that
the Cr6+ and Cr3+ species existed on the catalysts,
but also suggested that the oligomerization degree of chromium species
was at a relatively lower level.

Figure 6 Raman spectra for (l) calcined and (r)
spent catalysts (a) ZrCr/SiO2, (b) SrCr/SiO2, (c) SnCr/SiO2, (d)
CeCr/SiO2, and (e) Cr/SiO2.

The Raman spectra for the spent catalysts are shown
in Figure 6(r), some
changes
could be seen by comparing them with those for the calcined samples,
implying the changes in the structure that took place. Precisely speaking,
the broad band centered at 850 cm–1 shifted a little
to the lower side of 840 cm–1. At the same time,
the band at 987 cm–1 diminished and a new band at
1030 cm–1 appeared instead, which might be caused
by the increase of oligomerization of chromium species under the reaction
conditions.

Besides these, two distinct Raman bands centered
at 1580 and 1360
cm–1 were detected for all the samples, originating
from the stretching vibration mode of C=C and the bending vibration
mode of C–H, respectively. Such results indicated that the
coke deposition occurred during the reaction. More precisely, the
band at 1580 cm–1 was attributed to the G band which
was linked to the stretching vibration of the sp2 hybridized
carbon atom in the graphite lattice, whereas the band at 1360 cm–1 was assigned to the D band which was caused by the
vibration of the sp3 hybridized carbon atom in disordered
carbonaceous species.44,45

The degree of order of
the carbonaceous materials was usually evaluated
by the intensity ratio ID/IG for D and G bands which reflected the defect number
in graphitic materials.46,47 The ID/IG ratio (see Table 6) for our cases followed the
decreasing order as: SnCr/SiO2 (1.45) > Cr/SiO2 (1.35) > CeCr/SiO2 (1.28) > ZrCr/SiO2 (1.22)
> SrCr/SiO2 (1.18), which implied that the deposited
coke
was mainly in a disorder form.

2.6 Reducibility by H2-TPR
The redox ability of the Cr species was measured by H2-TPR, and the profiles are shown in Figure 7. It was obvious that the continuous hydrogen
consumption took place between 250 and 600 °C for each catalyst,
corresponding to the reduction of Cr6+ to Cr3+,24 the broad and overlapped reduction
peaks may suggest one or more transition states, for example, Cr5+ existed in the reduction process. The hydrogen consumption
could be roughly divided into three stages: (i) the low temperature
range between 250 and 350 °C, corresponding to the reduction
of Cr6+ species located in the vacancy defect sites or
in the corner, edge, and vertex of the lattice; (ii) the medium temperature
range between 350 and 440 °C, corresponding to the Cr6+ species on the lattice surface; and (iii) the high temperature range
from 440 to 600 °C, corresponding to the reduction of bulk Cr6+ species.

Figure 7 TPR profiles for different catalysts (a) ZrCr/SiO2,
(b) SrCr/SiO2, (c) SnCr/SiO2, (d) CeCr/SiO2, and (e) Cr/SiO2.

Although the reduction of each catalyst took place
in the same
temperature zone, the reduction behaviors were dependent on the type
of the promotor. The quantity of consumed hydrogen listed Table 6 shows that the ZrCr/SiO2 sample had a maximum value of 1.36 mmol/gcat.,
which was a little bit more than that for the SrCr/SiO2 sample (1.35 mmol/gcat.). The promotor-free sample Cr/SiO2 had the least hydrogen consumption (0.75 mmol/gcat.). Moreover, the hydrogen consumption distribution was also different.
ZrCr/SiO2 and CeCr/SiO2 exhibited the main hydrogen
consumption in a low temperature range, SrCr/SiO2 and Cr/SiO2 showed larger hydrogen consumption in a high temperature
range, while the sample SnCr/SiO2 had the similar values
in low and high temperature ranges. The results demonstrated that
the introduction of promotors could efficiently enhance the reduction
of Cr6+ species, but it also made the reduction of bulk
Cr6+ species more difficult as a higher temperature was
needed. The addition of Zr and Ce improved significantly the reduction
of Cr6+ species on the lattice surface.

2.7 Basicity by CO2-TPD
The
basicity of catalysts was analyzed by the temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD) method using CO2 as a probing molecule, and the desorption
profiles are recorded as shown in Figure 8. Similar CO2 desorption behaviors
could be found for all the samples, showing two desorption zones,
the one below 400 °C represented the CO2 desorbed
from weak basic sites, while the other one occurring at a higher temperature
could be considered as the desorption of CO2 from strong
basic ones. The desorption behaviors did not change significantly,
which was probably related to the low loading of promotors. On the
other hand, the introduction of promotors had a profound effect the
number of basic sites. According to the quantification results shown
in Table 6, CO2 uptake increased by 18.4% to 1.14 mmol/gcat. for
sample ZrCr/SiO2 compared with that for the promotor-free
Cr/SiO2 sample (0.93 mmol/gcat.). The introduction
of Ce had increased it slightly to 0.94 mmol/gcat., while
the addition of Sr and Sn played negative effects on the number of
basic sites, resulting in 0.89 mmol/gcat. for SrCr/SiO2 and 0.73 mmol/gcat. for SnCr/SiO2.
It was clear that the introduction of Zr was favored to enhance the
adsorption of CO2 on the catalyst surface, which would
be further activated and afterward compensate the consumed lattice
oxygen by linking it with the XPS findings.

CeCr/SiO2, and (e) Cr/SiO2.

2.8 Coke Deposition by TG
The coke deposition
took place under the reaction conditions, which has been proved by
the Raman measurements, and the disordered carbon was the majority.
The quantification of coke was proceeded by running the thermogravimetric
(TG) test in diluted oxygen on the spent catalysts, and the TG curves
are presented in Figure 9, showing a continuous weight loss process for all the samples. The
main weight loss due to the combustion of coke occurred between 450
and 600 °C, and no isolated peak could be found from derivative
TG curves for the SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 samples,
meaning that the quantity of coke was rather small. The calculated
quantity of coke in Table 6 shows that the additives could efficiently suppress the coke
formation during the reaction compared with that for the Cr/SiO2 catalyst (67.9 mgC/gcat.). SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 showed less quantity of coke among
the promoted catalysts as only 22.2 and 15.9 mgC/gcat. was formed, respectively. On the other hand, the bigger
pore diameter may play a positive role in restricting the coke deposition,
just because the larger space offered enough carbon capacity and promoted
the coke elimination reaction (CO2 + C → 2CO).

2.9 Morphology
The dispersion of different
elements was checked by performing the high-angle annular dark-field
imaging (HAADF)–scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
integrated with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) element
mapping measurements, and the images are depicted in Figure 10. It could be seen that the
Cr species were well dispersed in the calcined catalysts (a,c), and
no evident aggregation was found from the spent ones (b,d). The carbonaceous
substance was detected for both the spent catalysts, indicating the
occurrence of coke deposition during the reaction.

2.10 Catalytic Dehydrogenation of Ethane with
CO2
The various metal-promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts were applied to catalyze ethane dehydrogenation with CO2, and the reaction data are listed in Table 7. Compared with the promotor-free sample
Cr/SiO2, the Zr- and Ce-promoted catalysts showed the increasing
of ethane conversion (38.3% for ZrCr/SiO2 and 32.3% for
CeCr/SiO2), whereas the introduction of Sr and Sn had negative
influences on it, leading to a decrease in ethane conversion to 26.6
and 25.0% for SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 catalysts,
respectively. As far as the product distribution was concerned, the
desired product ethylene together with CO was the major parts for
all the catalysts. Methane was also found in the product, but the
proportion of it was quite small (<2.0%).

a Reaction conditions: mass of the
catalyst = 300 mg, atmospheric pressure, temperature = 700 °C,
flowrate of reactants = 30 mL·min–1, time on
stream = 8 h.

b The TOF was
calculated on the basis
of total Cr.

The calculation of turnover frequency (TOF) allowed
us to understand
deeply the influence of the promotor on Cr species and further on
catalytic conversion of ethane in the presence of CO2.
The TOF values calculated on the basis of total Cr is reported in Table 7, exhibiting a medium
value of 0.20 s–1 for the Cr/SiO2 sample.
It increased by 20% to 0.24 s–1 when Cr was partially
substituted by Ce, and reached the maximum of 0.32 s–1 for ZrCr/SiO2, which was at least 2 times as high as
those for SrCr/SiO2 (0.16 s–1) and SnCr/SiO2 (0.15 s–1). These results indicated that
the addition of Ce and Zr was favored to form more active Cr species
to improve the catalytic activity, while the Sn and Sr additives acted
in opposite roles.

The long-term stability was investigated
by running the 100 h time
on stream catalytic reactions, the performances including the initial
conversions (X0,i), final
conversions (Xf,i) of
reactants, and the selectivity of the desired product ethylene (Sf C2H4) are shown
in Table 8 and the
tracks of them are shown in Figure 11. The initial conversions of ethane on ZrCr/SiO2 and CeCr/SiO2 were 57.1 and 52.6%, respectively,
both of which were higher than that on Cr/SiO2 (48.5%),
confirming again the promotion of Zr and Ce in activation of ethane.
As abovementioned, the Sr and Sn additives could limit the conversion
activation of ethane, and the ethane conversion consequently dropped
down. All the catalysts showed a similar selectivity of ethylene with
the exception of Sn, like the 8 h time on stream reaction results
presented in Table 7, suggesting that ethylene was more selective on the SnCr/SiO2 sample. The catalysts showed a similar ability to activate
the oxidant CO2.

Cr/SiO2	48.5	25.4	47.6	41.2	22.5	45.4	73.8	
Concerning the stability, SrCr/SiO2 and
SnCr/SiO2 deactivated in the first 10 h and then remained
nearly unchanged,
and the conversion of ethane lost around 26.8 and 6.4%, respectively.
Over the sample ZrCr/SiO2, the conversion of ethane decreased
sharply by ∼37% from 57.1 to 36.0% in the first 20 h, and then
continued decreasing gently to 32.1% at the end of the reaction. The
analogue experiences could be also found over CeCr/SiO2 and Cr/SiO2, and it lost more than 40% in the test range.
It took less time to get the steady state for conversion of CO2 compared with that of ethane although fast deactivation was
observed as well. SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 reached
the steady state after reacting for 10 h which was prolonged to 20
h for the rest. Ethylene selectivity climbed up in the first 10 h
for all the samples and then kept nearly constant.

2.11 Discussion
The introduction of the
promotors like Ce, Zr, Sr, and Sn into the Cr/SiO2 system
had significant influences on the catalyst microstructure and surface
property, which further determined the catalytic performance and catalytic
stability. The key properties of catalysts including the proportion
of Cr6+ species, lattice oxygen (OI) and hydroxyl
oxygen (OII), and the initial activity are correlated in Figure 12. The samples SrCr/SiO2 and SnCr/SiO2 showed even lower initial conversions
of both ethane and CO2 reactants, the Cr6+ species
were absent AR although they could be found in the calcined catalysts,
meaning that the Cr6+ species underwent the irreversible
reduction to lower and less active Cr3+ species. On the
other hand, both lattice oxygen (OI) and hydroxyl oxygen
(OII) increased for CeCr/SiO2 and ZrCr/SiO2 samples compared with the pristine Cr/SiO2. During
the reaction, the ethane molecule was adsorbed on Cr6+ species
and oxidized by lattice oxygen, leaving the oxygen vacancy defect
and generating hydroxyl oxygen (OII) simultaneously. Therefore,
higher catalytic activity was obtained over the CeCr/SiO2 and ZrCr/SiO2 samples which involved more active Cr6+ species and lattice oxygen (OI). The reduced
Cr3+ species was reoxidized to Cr6+ species
by CO2 and the oxygen vacancy was thus refilled. As a consequence,
the CO2 conversion increased with the increasing of hydroxyl
oxygen (OII) which was directly linked to the oxygen vacancy
as mentioned in the XPS part. This result was in good agreement to
the experimental data. Obviously, the Cr6+ species were
indispensable to improve the catalytic activity, and it ensured that
the redox cycle of Cr species works smoothly. The type and number
of oxygen species were related to the redox and ability of CO2 activation, resulting in the difference in conversions of
ethane and CO2. Based on these results, a possible reaction
route was proposed as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 12 Correlations between the catalytic activity
and key properties
of the catalyst (red bars represent the proportion of Cr6+ species by XPS, orange bars represent the fraction of lattice oxygen,
blue bars represent that of hydroxyl oxygen, and cycles and triangles
represent the initial conversion of ethane and CO2, respectively).

Figure 13 Possible reaction route of ethane dehydrogenation with
CO2 on promoted Cr/SiO2 catalysts.

Concerning the catalytic stability for dehydrogenation
of ethane
in the presence of CO2, all the catalysts showed a fast
deactivation process during the initial stage although different promotors
had different effects on the conversions of the reactants. It was
mainly caused by the deposited coke because the aggregation of Cr
species was not evidently observed from the HAADF–STEM analysis.
The quantity of deposited coke determined by TG and the variation
in conversions of ethane and CO2 are plotted in Figure 14. Overall, the
conversions of both ethane and CO2 lost less catalysts
with less quantity of coke. The additives Zr and Ce were good to improve
the conversion of reactants, meanwhile to enhance the resistance to
coke. The Sr- and Sn-promoted samples showed a lower level of coke,
the lower reaction extent including coke formation reactions may also
contribute to it.

Figure 14 Deposited coke as a key factor for catalytic deactivation.

3 Conclusions
Cr in pristine Cr/SiO2 was partially substituted by
Zr, Sr, Sn, and Ce to give metal-promoted catalysts. Such a modification
did not bring considerable changes in porosity. The Cr6+ species were not detected by XRD because of the good dispersion,
whereas they could be found from XPS, UV–vis, and Raman measurements.
The surface composition as well as the chemical states of Cr and O
were significantly affected, and the Cr6+ species was irreversibly
reduced to Cr3+ which was less active for dehydrogenation
of ethane with CO2 when Sr and Sn were introduced, restricting
the conversion of ethane. The addition of Zr and Ce enhanced the reduction
of Cr6+ species on the lattice surface according to TPR
and generated more active oxygen species including the lattice oxygen
and hydroxyl oxygen, which promoted the conversions of ethane with
CO2. The catalytic deactivation was caused by deposited
coke regardless of the aggregation of Cr species through combining
the morphology, Raman, and TG studies. The TOF calculation showed
that the Zr promotor performed the best among the promoted catalysts,
and finally the highest initial conversion ethane (∼57%) was
obtained. At the same time, it also showed better catalytic stability
during 100 h time on the stream reaction among the catalysts with
the “promotion effect”.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Catalyst Preparation
The catalysts
were prepared by the ICI method. SiO2 was activated at
500 °C for 4 h to remove the adsorbed water and impurities prior
to use. The precursor of the promotor (Zr(NO3)4·5H2O, Sr(NO3)2, SnCl2, and Ce(NO3)3·6H2O as Zr,
Sr, Sn, and Ce sources, respectively.) and Cr source (Cr(NO3)3·9H2O) were dissolved in a certain amount
of deionized water to get the impregnation solution. The solids were
dried at 70 °C overnight after the ICI process, and then calcined
at 600 °C for 4 h in static air. The samples were denoted as
MCr/SiO2 (M = Zr, Sr, Sn, and Ce) where the contents of
promotor M and Cr were 2 and 10 wt %, respectively. The sample Cr/SiO2 with 12 wt % of Cr was also prepared by the same procedure
as a reference.

4.2 Catalyst Characterization
The porosity
of catalysts was analyzed on a Quantachrome Nova 1000e apparatus by
measuring the nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms at liquid nitrogen
temperature (77 K). The specific surface area, pore volume, and average
pore diameter were calculated by the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) method and by the Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH)
method, respectively. The catalysts were degassed at 200 °C for
3 h prior to analysis.

The crystalline phase analysis was performed
on a Bruker AXS D8 Advance diffractometer (Cu Kα, 40 kV, 40
mA, λ = 1.5406 Å). The diffraction patterns were recorded
in the range from 10 to 80° with steps of 0.02°/s and an
acquisition time of 2 s.

XPS was performed on a XSAM 800 spectrometer
using Al Kα
radiation (1486.6 eV) to obtain the surface chemical state and the
atomic composition. The C 1s peak of adventitious carbon was fixed
to 284.5 eV as a reference.

A UV2100 UV–visible spectrophotometer
was used to measure
the state of Cr species, and UV–vis diffuse reflectance spectra
were scanned from 200 to 800 nm using BaSO4 as a sample
holder.

The reducibility of the catalyst was studied on a TP-5080
apparatus
equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD). Typically, 50
mg sample was first pretreated in N2 flow (30 mL/min) at
300 °C for 3 h to remove the impurity, and then heated to 800
°C with a ramp of 10 °C/min in a H2–Ar
mixture (5.0 vol % H2 in Ar).

CO2-TPD
was used to analyze the basicity of the catalyst
on a Micromeritics AutoChem II 2920 system equipped with a U-type
reactor and a TCD. In a typical test, the sample was pretreated in
He flow (50 mL/min) at 200 °C for 2 h, and then cooled down to
50 °C. The sample was exposed in diluted CO2 flow
(50 mL/min, 10 vol % CO2 in He) until saturation which
was determined by TCD. The desorption process was proceeded from 100
to 900 °C in He flow (50 mL/min) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
after purging the sample at 100 °C.

HAADF in a STEM mode
was measured on an FEI Titan G2 60-300 (AC-TEM)
apparatus combined with a Bruker Esprit Super X detector, operating
at 300 kV accelerating voltage.

TG analysis (NETZSCH STA 449
C) was employed to quantify the deposited
coke on the spent catalyst, the combustion of coke was carried out
from 100 to 700 °C in diluted oxygen flow (O2/N2: 10/90 vol) with a ramp of 5 °C/min.

4.3 Catalytic Evaluation
The catalytic
oxidative dehydrogenation of ethane with carbon dioxide was carried
out in a fixed-bed quartz reactor (i.d.: 8 mm, length: 200 mm) under
atmospheric pressure. Usually, 300 mg of the catalyst mixed with 1.7
g quartz sand (40–60 mesh) was loaded in the middle of the
reactor. The catalyst bed was heated to 700 °C in N2 flow (30 mL/min), and then switched to the reactants (C2H6/CO2/N2/Ar = 20:20:4:56, 30 mL/min).
The gaseous products were analyzed by an online GC equipped with packed
Porapak Q (3 mm o.d., 3 m length) and molecular sieve (3 mm o.d.,
3 m length) columns in series and TCD. The conversion of reactants
and the selectivity of products were calculated by 3   4  

The TOF was calculated by the following eq 5, where y represented the concentration of ethylene in the products, ftotal was the flow rate of the reactants in
mol/s, and nCr was the amount of Cr in
mole. 5
