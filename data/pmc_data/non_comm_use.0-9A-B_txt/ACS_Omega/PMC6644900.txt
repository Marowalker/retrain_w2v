The interaction between cellulose
and hemicelluloses is of fundamental
importance for understanding the molecular architecture of plant cell
walls. Adsorption of xyloglucan (XG) onto regenerated cellulose (RC),
sulfated cellulose nanocrystal (s-CNC), and desulfated cellulose nanocrystal
(d-CNC) films was studied by quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
monitoring, surface plasmon resonance, and atomic force microscopy.
The amount of XG adsorbed onto different cellulose substrates increased
in the order RC < s-CNC < d-CNC. The adsorption of XG onto RC
films was independent of film thickness (d), whereas
XG adsorption was weakly dependent on d for s-CNC
films and strongly dependent on d for d-CNC films.
However, approximately the same amount of XG adsorbed onto “monolayer-thin”
films of RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC. These results suggest that the morphology
and surface charge of the cellulose substrate played a limited role
in XG adsorption and highlight the importance of film thickness of
cellulose nanocrystalline films to XG adsorption.

Introduction
Understanding the structure
and synthesis of natural systems is
of fundamental interest, particularly for those seeking renewable
sources of energy and functional materials.1 Resources from plants, such as cellulose and, to a lesser extent,
xyloglucan (XG), have already found widespread use in the paper, textile,
and food industries.2,3 A deeper comprehension of the
primary cell wall of plants, to include the interactions of cellulose
with other cell wall polysaccharides such as XG, could facilitate
the extraction and use of these renewable resources.1,4

The primary cell wall of wood and flowering plants is a thin
layer
(50–200 nm) composed of cellulose, hemicelluloses, and pectin.
Cellulose, constituting 20–30% of the solid mass of the cell
wall, is arranged as crystalline microfibrils with diameters of ∼4
nm and degrees of polymerization ranging from 200 to 4500, although
amorphous cellulose domains are also present. Hemicelluloses, which
account for 20–30% of the solid cell wall mass, network the
cellulose microfibrils through either direct or indirect linkages.
XG is typically the most abundant hemicellulose in the primary cell
wall, converting the cellulose network into a more elastomeric system.
Pectins cross-link with other pectins or Ca2+ ions to form
a separate network, with the degree of acetylation along the pectin
chains affecting the water content and porosity of the wall. Additionally,
primary cell walls of these plants contain at least 70% water by mass,
as well as soluble salts and oftentimes glycoproteins.5,6

Although XG significantly alters the mechanical properties
of the
cellulose network of wood and flowering plants, the nature of the
interactions between XG and cellulose is not fully understood.7 In brief, XG has been proposed to cross-link
cellulose microfibrils, either via physical entrapment of a XG chain
end within a cellulose microfibril and noncovalent (e.g., hydrogen-bonding)
interactions with the surface of an adjacent microfibril, or via purely
noncovalent interactions between XG and multiple microfibril surfaces.8,9 An alternative model suggests that XG does not link cellulose microfibrils
together, but rather links the cellulose microfibrils to the pectic
network. In this model, one XG chain end noncovalently interacts with
a microfibril, whereas the rest of the chain interacts with pectin,
either via covalent or noncovalent linkages.10,11 A more recent model proposed on the basis of NMR studies suggests
that pectin forms noncovalent cross-links with cellulose microfibrils,
XG intercalates between adjacent microfibrils, and pectin covalently
cross-links with XG.12 Regardless of the
means of interaction, the binding of XG to cellulose is a principle
feature of the primary cell wall of wood and flowering plants.

Due to the complexity of the cell wall and the difficulty in studying
XG-cellulose interactions in situ, several groups have extracted cellulose
and XG from various sources to examine the binding and adsorption
behavior between these materials.8,13−20 It should be noted that many studies in the literature, including
that of this work, use XG from tamarind seeds. This XG source is a
storage hemicellulose that differs in sugar side-chain composition,
acetylation, and size from XG found in the primary cell wall of woods
and flowering plants.21,22 Further, the source and material
processing of cellulose can alter the physical properties of the surface
(e.g., hydrophobicity), also affecting hemicellulose interaction with
cellulose.21,23 Collectively, studies haves shown
that differences in XG composition and structure, as well as the model
cellulose surface, can significantly influence hemicellulose–cellulose
adsorption.21 Regardless, adsorption studies
of model hemicelluloses to model cellulose thin films remains an important
area of research in understanding both plant cell walls and uses of
these materials.

The reported XG adsorption onto cellulose of
varied mesostructures
ranged from 0.4–27 mg·m–2.13,16,18 This disparity in the reported
values may stem from differences in accessible cellulose surface area,
as stated by several works.13−15,20 Further, the kinetics of XG adsorption can result in variable XG
adsorption based on the experimental conditions.24,25 The surface charge of the cellulose may also play a role in XG adsorption,
though the literature shows somewhat conflicting results as to whether
charge limits, enhances, or does not affect the XG adsorption to a
charged cellulose surface.16−18 Although the different molecular
weights of the various XG samples used in these studies likely contributes
to the significant discrepancy between the reported values for XG
adsorption to cellulose,19 lingering questions
remain regarding how cellulose morphology, accessible surface area,
and charge affect XG adsorption.

The aim of this work was to
further investigate the role of model
cellulose mesostructure, charge effects, and thin film thickness on
the adsorption of XG. The cellulose substrates used in this work were
thin films of amorphous regenerated cellulose (RC),26,27 sulfated cellulose nanocrystals (s-CNC) containing an anionic surface
charge,28,29 and desulfated cellulose nanocrystals (d-CNC)
containing no charge on the cellulose surface.30 Previous studies of RC thin films have determined that
spin-coated RC films are essentially amorphous and, while these films
swell considerably in water, adsorbates with a radius of gyration
(Rg) as small as 4 nm were confined to
the surface and did not penetrate into the film.27,31,32 Previous studies of cellulose nanocrystalline
thin films spin-coated from aqueous suspensions have shown than s-CNC
and d-CNC are essentially cellulose I (e.g., native crystalline cellulose)
with a crystallinity of ∼87%.29,33,34 As opposed to RC films, s-CNC and d-CNC films are
quite porous to both water and small adsorbates (Rg ∼ 4 nm) and the accessible cellulose surface
area is proportional to the thickness of the film for small adsorbates.32

Because RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC films have
varied morphology, surface
charge, and accessible surface area, these cellulose substrates are
ideally suited for studying how these parameters affect XG adsorption.
Consequently, adsorption isotherms for XG from tamarind onto amorphous
RC, sulfated nanocrystalline s-CNC, and desulfated nanocrystalline
d-CNC were measured using quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation
monitoring (QCM-D) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR). These two
complimentary techniques also permit the estimation of the water content
of the adsorbed XG layer while allowing inferences about how the various
cellulose substrates affect the conformation of the adsorbed XG. Additionally,
the effect of accessible surface area of XG adsorption was probed
by generating cellulose films of varied thickness (d). Even though specific values of surface area are only known for
RC, it is known that the accessible surface areas of s-CNC and d-CNC
are directly proportional to the film thickness.32 Collectively, this information is expected to aid in selecting
appropriate cellulose substrates for studies aimed at investigating
interactions between cellulose and other biopolymers, as well as identifying
materials for candidates in biomimetic cell wall composites.

Results
and Discussion
Before determining the maximum XG adsorption
onto the RC, s-CNC,
and d-CNC model cellulose surfaces via QCM-D and SPR adsorption isotherms,
the effect of increasing cellulose film thickness on the quantity
of XG adsorbed was first investigated. As previously noted, there
is significant disparity in the literature regarding how much XG adsorbs
to cellulose and to what extent cellulose morphology, surface charge,
and accessible surface area influence XG adsorption.13−20 Whereas traditional bulk measurements of porosity in the gas phase
would have little relevance to ultrathin films of hydrophilic polymers
in aqueous media, changing the thickness of a porous thin film is
a viable strategy for observing the effect of increasing surface area
on adsorption.32 Thus, by examining the
adsorption of XG from a single-concentration solution (100 mg·L–1) onto three different model cellulose surfaces, each
with varied crystallinity and surface charge, at a range of film thicknesses,
the effects of cellulose morphology, surface charge, and surface area
on XG adsorption were determined.

As shown in Figure 1, the XG surface excess for
RC films was independent of film thickness
and equal to 0.63 ± 0.05 mg·m–2. This
result indicates that XG was confined to the RC surface, similar to
a previous study of cellulose adsorption to RC.32 For s-CNC and d-CNC films, the data indicated two regimes,
a film-thickness-dependent and a film-thickness-independent regime.
For both s-CNC and d-CNC films in the thickness-dependent regime,
a linear fit of the data had a slope of 0.19 ± 0.03 mg·m–2·nm–1. In the thickness-independent
regime, s-CNC and d-CNC had XG surface excess values of 1.9 ±
0.2 and 4.8 ± 0.1 mg·m–2, respectively.
Note, however, that as the film thickness approached a cellulose “monolayer”
(d → 0), the XG adsorption onto RC, s-CNC,
and d-CNC all approached a similar value (ΓSPR ∼
0.7 mg·m–2). Control data for XG adsorbed onto
gold and onto the self-assembled monolayer-coated gold substrates
yielded ΓSPR of 0.37 ± 0.06 and 0.28 ±
0.06 mg·m–2, respectively. Collectively, the
data from Figure 1 suggests
that cellulose surface charge and morphology play a limited role in
XG adsorption, whereas accessible surface area of the thin film significantly
affects the measured XG adsorption, in line with other studies.

Figure 1 Surface excess
(ΓSPR) of XG versus cellulose film
thickness (d) for XG adsorbed onto RC (■,
——), s-CNC (▲, — · ·), and d-CNC
(●, ---) films after 2 h of exposure to a 100 mg·L–1 XG solution. Average-value trend lines are provided
as a guide to the eye.

Regarding surface charge effects, the result of a single
slope
in the thickness-dependent regime for s-CNC and d-CNC indicates that
the surface charge on s-CNC has an insignificant effect on adsorption
affinity of XG for the cellulose surface. That XG adsorption onto
each model cellulose surface all approach the same surface excess
value as the film thickness approaches a nonporous monolayer further
supports the conclusion that the anionic surface of s-CNC must not
significantly inhibit or promote XG adsorption. This conclusion is
similar to a previous colorimetry study of XG binding onto s-CNC that
observed that the presence of s-CNC sulfate groups had no detectable
effect on XG binding.17

Likewise,
the morphology of the cellulose substrate does not seem
to significantly contribute to the observed differences in maximum
XG adsorbed onto RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC films. As is evident from Figure 1, XG adsorption onto
amorphous RC films and crystalline s-CNC and d-CNC films both approach
the same value (∼0.7 mg·m–2) as the
thickness of the cellulose substrate approaches a monolayer. This
lack of preferential binding of XG onto different cellulose morphologies
has been proposed in the literature and is not so surprising when
considering that at the crystal surface, cellulose chains have disrupted
hydrogen-bonding pairs and a structure that deviates from that of
cellulose chains in the middle of the crystal lattice.17,20,35,36 In fact, surface chains of crystalline cellulose have been considered
essentially amorphous.37

However,
as shown in other studies, the accessible surface area
of cellulose thin films significantly affected the measured XG adsorption
and should be quantified to ensure the measurement of adsorption isotherms
in the thickness-independent regime for the cellulose surface used.13−15 As expected, the XG adsorption to the RC films did not depend on
film thickness, indicating XG was confined to the surface. However,
for the porous, crystalline s-CNC and d-CNC films, the film-thickness-dependent
regime for XG adsorption suggests that XG entered the s-CNC and d-CNC
films, increasing the available surface area for binding interactions
and consistent with similar work with cellulose nanocrystals.20,32,38 Though XG adsorption onto d-CNC
surfaces was greater than that onto s-CNC surfaces by nearly a factor
of 2, this observation likely stems from differences in pore size
between d-CNC and s-CNC films rather than a difference in XG/cellulose
interaction caused by electrostatic effects.29,32 The porosity of cellulose nanocrystalline thin films is well established.
A previous study of cellulase adsorption to d-CNC and s-CNC films
noted nearly identical adsorption of cellulase to these substrates.32 The radius of gyration of XG in solution has
been measured to be ∼120 nm (∼800 kDa), whereas that
of cellulase is ∼4 nm.39,40 Coupled with the result
of similar XG adsorption onto a cellulose monolayer for s-CNC and
d-CNC, it is likely that s-CNC films have smaller pores than d-CNC
films and that these larger XG molecules (relative to cellulase) are
not able to enter as deeply into the s-CNC film. Smaller pore sizes
for s-CNC films relative to d-CNC films are expected, as d-CNC colloidal
suspensions are known to form larger aggregates in suspension and
form thicker, rougher films than s-CNC when spin-coated under identical
conditions.30,32

To further investigate
the differences in accessible surface area
between the three cellulose model substrates, the viscoelasticity
of the XG/cellulose substrate was measured via QCM-D. As an acoustic
technique, the QCM-D is sensitive to changes in density and viscosity
of the surrounding medium.41 An indication
of the viscous nature of an adsorbed layer is provided by changes
in dissipation (D) 1  where Estored is
the energy stored in the sensor crystal and Edissipated is the energy dissipated by the viscous nature of
the surrounding medium. An increase in ΔD indicates
the addition of a more viscous medium (e.g., swelling), whereas a
decrease indicates a change to a more rigid environment (e.g., from
networking or release of solvent).41−44

As shown in Figure 2A, ΔD increased slightly for both low and
high concentrations when XG adsorbed onto RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC, the
exception being when XG adsorbed onto d-CNC films from low-concentration
solutions. For XG adsorption onto d-CNC films, a crossover from negative
to positive ΔD occurs at ∼250 mg·L–1 (Figure 2B). Thus, for RC and s-CNC films, the dissipation increased
with XG adsorption, consistent with adsorption of a floppy, swollen
film at the surface.41 However, the dissipation
initially decreased at low concentrations of XG adsorption onto the
d-CNC films. A dissipation decrease is indicative of a decrease in
the viscoelasticity of the system (e.g., the system becomes more rigid).41 The crossover from negative to positive dissipation
upon increasing adsorption has previously been attributed to the removal
of water from the system.42−44

as a reference (---).

As discussed in greater detail later in this work, the average
water content for XG films adsorbed onto the three cellulose substrates
increased in the order of d-CNC (38 ± 6%) < s-CNC (54 ±
9%) < RC (81 ± 3%). This trend is reasonable for XG penetrating
into the porous s-CNC and d-CNC films. Unlike XG adsorbed at the surface
where each XG molecule added to the surface brings new coupled water
to the film, XG penetrating into the film must displace water already
coupled to the film (80% by volume), leading to smaller apparent water
contents.32 In fact, a recent study shows
that the driving mechanism for XG adsorption onto cellulose is the
entropic release of water caused by XG displacement.20

Considering that before XG adsorption, the porous
d-CNC films contain
significant water content between the rodlike nanocrystals of the
thin film and that Figure 1 clearly illustrates that d-CNC films are porous to XG,32 it is reasonable to suggest that at low XG concentrations,
the XG enters the d-CNC film, displacing water and resulting in the
observed dissipation decrease. As the XG concentration increases and
the d-CNC film saturates, the XG adsorbs to the surface, forming a
floppy swollen film (similar to the case for RC and s-CNC) and leading
to a dissipation increase. This dissipation increase for XG adsorption
at higher concentrations onto d-CNC films may also be a function of
swelling within the d-CNC film caused by flexible tethering of nanocrystals
by the XG, similar to observations made by Cerclier et al.18 Although these effects might also be expected
for XG adsorption to the porous s-CNC films, it should be noted that
the thickness dependence of XG adsorption occurred over a smaller
range of film thicknesses and the total amount of XG adsorbed onto
s-CNC was much lower than that for the case of d-CNC.

After
determining the film thickness of the independent regime
for each model cellulose substrate, adsorption isotherms for XG onto
RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC were measured in this thickness-independent regime
via both QCM-D and SPR (Figure 3). Representative data for each isotherm data point is provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Details of the conversion of the measured QCM-D and SPR data into
ΓQCM and ΓSPR, respectively, are
also provided in the Supporting Information (Table S1). In brief, the Sauerbrey equation was used to convert the
scaled frequency change (Δf/n) measured by QCM-D into ΓQCM,45 whereas the equation of de Feijter et al. was used to convert
the irreversible change in surface plasmon angle (θsp) into ΓSPR, similar to previous reports.46,47 Values of ΓQCM and ΓSPR for XG
adsorption onto RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC films were fit by both the Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherms, though Figure 3 shows only the model that best fit the data.
Parameters for this models are provided in the Supporting Information
(Table S2).

s-CNC, and (●) d-CNC films via SPR. Solid lines represent fits
with Freundlich isotherms, whereas dashed lines indicate fits with
Langmuir isotherms.

As is evident from Figure 3, the amount of XG
adsorbed onto cellulose substrates increased
in the order RC < s-CNC < d-CNC for both measurement techniques.
Additionally, for each of the three different cellulose substrates,
ΓQCM was greater than ΓSPR. This
is expected, as QCM-D is sensitive to both the adsorbed film, its
viscoelastic properties (e.g., rigid or soft), and any water entrapped
within the film,48 whereas SPR is sensitive
only to the adsorbed film.32 QCM-D results
showed that the maximum Γ for XG adsorption onto the three cellulose
substrates increased in the order of RC (3.8 ± 0.3 mg·m–2) < s-CNC (4.8 ± 0.2 mg·m–2) < d-CNC (11 ± 2 mg·m–2). Likewise,
SPR results showed that maximum Γ for XG adsorbed onto the three
cellulose substrates increased in the order of RC (0.9 ± 0.2
mg·m–2) < s-CNC (2.2 ± 0.3 mg·m–2) < d-CNC (5.7 ± 0.5 mg·m–2). The maximum surface concentrations (Γ) as determined by
SPR compare favorably with previous studies of XG adsorption onto
cellulose. Literature values for Γ range from 0.4–2.2
mg·m–2, which agree within about an order of
magnitude of the values determined in this work.13,14,16,20 Because the
surface area of some cellulose samples from the literature was not
studied, direct comparison of XG adsorption data from several previous
studies with this work is not possible, especially as this work infers
surface area affects from film thickness and morphology rather than
via direct measurement.8,17,19 Again, as noted, differences in Γ stem from variation in cellulose
accessibility,13−15,32 although variation
in molecular weight of the particular XG samples used throughout the
literature, as well as the experimentally variable kinetics of adsorption,
also contribute to these differences.19,24,25

It should also be noted that care must be taken
in selecting the
appropriate technique to measure adsorption. For example, QCM-D measurements
of XG adsorption onto cellulose give significantly higher Γ
than other methods, as swelling and viscous effects contribute to
the response of the instrument. Several QCM-D studies have noted that
XG adsorption onto cellulose continually increases for over 12 h,16,18 although the SPR data of this work indicated that 2 h was sufficient
to reach maximum irreversible adsorption after rinsing (Figure S1). As noted in the literature, the appearance
of long-term XG adsorption via QCM-D may instead be a response driven
by a constantly changing conformation of XG on the surface, highlighting
the need for a complimentary technique such as SPR.

The water
content associated with XG adsorbed onto the different
cellulose substrates was calculated from the difference in Γ
as determined by QCM-D and SPR49 2  ΓQCM and ΓSPR for each concentration greater than 2 mg·L–1 of each cellulose substrate were used to calculate an average water
content for the adsorbed XG layer specific to that cellulose substrate.
Using this technique, the average water content for XG films adsorbed
onto the three cellulose substrates increased in the order of d-CNC
(38 ± 6%) < s-CNC (54 ± 9%) < RC (81 ± 3%). The
type of polymer adsorbed to thin cellulose films (e.g., polyelectrolyte
versus XG) strongly affects coupled water, as does the type of cellulose
surface (e.g., regenerated cellulose versus CNC). For example, polyelectrolyte
adsorption onto regenerated cellulose has shown significant coupled
water because the polymer is confined to the surface.50 Conversely, polyelectrolyte adsorption onto CNC has shown
stiffening and water release.16 Again,
this trend is reasonable for XG penetrating into the porous s-CNC
and d-CNC films, where XG penetrates into the film and displaces water
already coupled to the film (80% by volume) in an entropically favored
process, leading to smaller apparent water contents.20,32

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images did not show significant
differences
at the surface after XG adsorption and subsequent drying. Initially,
the cellulose films had root mean square (RMS) roughness values of
1.56 ± 0.01, 2.3 ± 0.3, and 3.04 ± 0.04 nm for RC,
s-CNC, and d-CNC films, respectively. These values indicate the films
are relatively smooth, in agreement with several other studies.14,50,52 As shown in Figure 4, some XG appears to adsorb
to the cellulose surfaces as aggregates, with a greater amount of
aggregation present after exposure to higher XG concentration, especially
for RC films. The size of the aggregates did not change significantly
from low to high concentration, nor did the RMS roughness of the films
change significantly after XG adsorption (Figure S2 and Table S3). Thus, these data suggest that the binding
mechanism of XG to amorphous and crystalline regions of cellulose
are similar and morphology plays a limited role in adsorption.17,35−37

Figure 4 Representative AFM images for bare RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC
films exposed
to 10 and 500 mg·L–1 XG. The scans are 10 ×
10 μm2 with a 20 nm z-scale.

Collectively, the accessible cellulose
surface area (e.g., film
thickness), the QCM-D dissipation data, the adsorption isotherms,
the water content of adsorbed XG films, and the AFM images suggest
a model of XG adsorption onto RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC as depicted in Figure 5. For RC films, XG
is confined to the surface via nonspecific hydrogen bonding between
XG and cellulose.17,36 The large water content (>80%
by mass) of XG films adsorbed onto RC substrates is consistent with
a three-dimensional XG conformation in the form of a floppy, loop-and-train-like
structure on the RC surface.51 This model
is consistent with recent work that suggests that as little as 10–15%
XG directly interacts with surface hydroxyl groups.12 For s-CNC films, some XG chains are able to penetrate into
the porous film. The result is limited sorption of XG into the film
and XG adsorption onto the surface. XG sorbed into s-CNC substrates
displaces water from the system. Additionally, XG chains within the
interior of the porous s-CNC substrate likely bind to multiple nanocrystals,
resulting in a more rigid attachment to the cellulose relative to
XG chains on the surface only.20 Thus,
the total water added to the film for XG adsorption onto s-CNC substrates
was lower (∼50% by mass) than that for XG adsorbed onto RC
films. For d-CNC films, XG adsorption was qualitatively similar to
adsorption onto s-CNC films. Quantitatively, XG was able to penetrate
more deeply into the d-CNC films. As discussed above, the d-CNC pores
are likely to be larger than those of the s-CNC film, leading to greater
sorption. As QCM-D data indicated a negative change in dissipation
for XG adsorption onto d-CNC at low XG concentrations, the presence
of XG within the d-CNC substrate led to a significant decrease in
the viscous nature of the total system (d-CNC plus adsorbed XG). However,
it is not clear whether this decrease is due to removal of water from
the porous d-CNC film, enhanced tethering of various nanocrystals
via XG, or both. However, it is likely that the XG primarily acts
as a filler between the nanocrystals, rather than a tether, as again,
studies have shown that relatively little XG directly contacts the
hydroxyl groups of the cellulose surface.12 At high XG concentration, limited sorption of XG into the d-CNC
film continued, followed by XG adsorption onto the surface. The total
water content for XG adsorbed onto d-CNC substrates (∼40%)
was slightly smaller than for XG adsorbed onto s-CNC substrates, again
suggesting that the charge of the cellulose substrate played a limited
role on the adsorption process other than to restrict access to the
film interior through smaller effective pore sizes.

depicting XG adsorption onto (A) RC films,
(B) s-CNC films, and (C) d-CNC films. XG is confined to the surface
of RC films, whereas limited sorption occurs in s-CNC and d-CNC films.

Conclusions
We have shown in this
study that cellulose morphology and surface
charge have limited effects on the adsorption of XG onto thin films
of cellulose, whereas film thickness affects the measured XG adsorption
for thinner films of cellulose nanocrystals. Clearly, the accessible
surface area (as assessed by varying the film thickness of the porous
substrates) of a film plays a significant role in adsorption and must
be addressed for future studies between cellulose and other polysaccharides.
As XG binding to model cellulose thin films appears nonspecific and
uninfluenced by crystallinity of the cellulose sample, RC films have
significant advantages over nanocrystalline films in competitive adsorption
studies because the adsorbates are confined to the smooth surface
of the RC substrate and adsorption onto RC is thus thickness independent.
Additionally, the fact that XG penetrates more deeply into the thin
d-CNC films has important implications in building nanoscale models
of the cell wall and biomimetic composites. One envisions using porous
d-CNC substrates along with XG, other hemicelluloses, and pectins
as a construct for multicomponent primary cell wall models.

Methods
Materials
XG from tamarind seeds was purchased from
Megazyme, Inc. (202 kDa [lot 00401b]; 31% xylose, 49% glucose, 17%
galactose, 2% arabinose, and 1% other sugars). Trimethylsilyl cellulose
(TMSC) with a degree of substitution of 2.71 was synthesized according
to a previous report.53 s-CNC was prepared
by sulfuric acid hydrolysis of dissolving-grade softwood pulp (Temalfa
93-A-A, Tembec, Inc.), whereas d-CNC was prepared by pyridine-based
desulfation of s-CNC.31 Both s-CNC and
d-CNC had heights and lengths of 3 ± 2 and 125 ± 36 nm,
respectively. The charge density of s-CNC was 0.340 mequiv·g–1 as determined by conductometric titration, whereas
that of d-CNC was 0.000 mequiv·g–1. 11-Amino-1-undecanethiol,
NH4OH (28% w/w), and H2O2 (30% w/w)
were purchased from VWR International, Fisher Scientific, and EM Science,
respectively. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q Gradient A-10, Milli-Q, 18.2
MΩ·cm, <5 ppb organic impurities) was used in all experiments.

Substrate Cleaning
Gold QCM-D (Q-Sense AB, gold, 5
MHz) and SPR (Reichert, gold) sensors were cleaned by first exposing
the surface to UV/ozone for 20 min, followed by immersion into a 1:1:5
v/v of NH4OH/H2O2/H2O
solution at 80 °C for 1 h. Following another UV/ozone treatment,
the substrates were rinsed with water and dried with N2.

Film Deposition
Regenerated Cellulose
RC films were
formed on cleaned
sensors from a solution of TMSC in toluene spin-coated at 2000 rpm
for 60 s. Films of different thickness were obtained by variation
of the TMSC solution concentration between 0.2 and 1.0% by mass. Exposure
of the TMSC film to the vapor of an aqueous 10% by mass solution of
hydrochloric acid for 2 min yielded a smooth RC film.28 Previous studies have shown that these thin RC films contain
35% water by mass.32

Cellulose
Nanocrystals
An amine-terminated alkanethiol
self-assembled monolayer (SAM-NH2) was formed on the cleaned
gold QCM-D sensor crystals after immersion in a 1 mM solution of 11-amino-1-undecanol
in ethanol for 24 h. Films of different thickness were spin-coated
at 4000 rpm for 60 s from aqueous s-CNC and d-CNC suspensions with
concentrations that ranged from 0.2 to 1.0% by mass. Films were subsequently
heat treated overnight at 80 °C before thicknesses were determined.
Previous studies have shown that these thin CNC films contain 76%
water by mass.32

Ellipsometry
Measurements
The film thickness of the
prepared cellulose substrates was determined with a multiangle of
incidence ellipsometer (Picometer Ellipsometer, Beaglehole Instruments)
equipped with a single wavelength (633 nm) laser light source. The
angle of incidence was varied between 60 and 80° with 1°
steps. The film thickness was modeled with TFCompanion software (Semiconsoft)
assuming a refractive index of 1.51 for RC, s-CNC, and d-CNC films.
Further details on the selection of this value for the refractive
index for all three types of cellulose films despite variations in
their morphology can be found in the literature.33,54 Each substrate was measured three times, and reported values are
average film thicknesses ± one standard deviation.

Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM) Measurements
Cellulose
surfaces were imaged in tapping mode with an Asylum Research AFM (MFP-3D-BIO,
Asylum Research). Height images were collected under ambient conditions
with a silicon tip (OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus Corp.). The reported root
mean square (RMS) roughnesses were determined from 2 × 2 μm2 scan areas. Line scan analysis of aggregates visible on the
AFM height images were conducted by obtaining a height profile in
the z-dimension for ten aggregates. Reported aggregate
heights represent the average ± one standard deviation.

Refractive
Index Increment Measurements
The refractive
index increment (dn/dc) of XG solutions
in water was determined with a refractive index detector (Optilab
rEX, Wyatt Technology Corp.) equipped with a laser light source (690
nm). Measurements were conducted at 25 °C on XG concentrations
ranging from 0 to 500 mg·L–1. The (dn/dc) was determined from the slope of
a plot of refractive index versus concentration.

SPR Measurements
XG adsorption onto cellulose thin
films was followed by SPR (SR7000, Reichert Inc.). After the thickness
of the cellulose film had been determined by ellipsometry, the sensor
slide was immediately placed into the SPR flow cell. Water was introduced
into the flow cell at a rate of 0.200 mL·min–1 at 25 °C for several hours until a stable baseline was obtained.
Degassed XG solution at the same temperature and flow rate as water
was then pumped into the flow cell via a switch value, thereby limiting
air bubbles in the system. Separate SPR experiments were run for each
XG concentration and each cellulose film was exposed to XG for 2 h.
Experiments were run in triplicate, and reported values are means
± one standard deviation. Changes in surface plasmon angle (θsp) were converted to surface concentration (ΓSPR, mg·m–2) with the equation of de Feijter
et al.46 Further information on this equation,
as well as details for the calculation of ΓSPR from
SPR data, is provided in the Supporting Information.

QCM-D Measurements
An E4 QCM-D (Q-Sense AB) was used
to determine XG adsorption onto cellulose thin films. After the thickness
of the cellulose film had been determined by ellipsometry, the sensor
crystal was immediately placed into the QCM-D flow cell. Water was
introduced into the flow cell at a rate of 0.200 mL·min–1 at 25 °C for several hours until a stable baseline was obtained.
XG solution was then introduced into the flow cell at the same rate
and temperature as water and the change in frequency and dissipation
was recorded. Separate QCM-D experiments were run for each XG concentration
and each cellulose film was exposed to XG for 2 h. Experiments were
run in triplicate, and reported values are means ± one standard
deviation. Changes in measured scaled frequency (Δf/n) were converted to surface concentration (ΓQCM, mg·m–2) with the Sauerbrey equation.45 The fifth overtone was used in analyzing all
the QCM-D data. Further information on the validity of this equation,
as well as details for the calculation of ΓQCM from
QCM-D data, is provided in the Supporting Information. In comparing ΓQCM to ΓSPR data,
differences arising from flow cell geometry were neglected.52,55
