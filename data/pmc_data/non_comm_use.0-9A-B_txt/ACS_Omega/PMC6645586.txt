A novel, efficient, and simple method
for the resolution of racemic
mixtures is presented in which PEGylated resolving agents are subjected
to diastereomeric complex formation in alcohols. The resulting complexes
then undergo temperature-assisted phase transition, affording a precipitate
that is enriched in one enantiomer and separable by filtration. In
an aqueous solution, phase transition can be caused by the methods
used in the precipitation of poly(ethylene glycol) (e.g., addition
of ammonium sulfate). A number of racemic amines have been successfully
resolved using this method. The first cycle of resolution affords
the amines with an optical purity of 72–85% from their corresponding
racemic mixture in good yields (78–90%). An additional cycle
improved the optical purity to 87–95%. The PEGylated resolving
agents can be recovered and reutilized without the loss of resolution
efficiency.

1 Introduction
Chirality
is a trademark of complexity and elegance of biological
systems. Amino acids, proteins, carbohydrates, nucleosides, most alkaloids,
and hormones are chiral compounds. The broad utility of chiral molecules
in an optically pure form as biologically active compounds (pharmaceuticals
and agrochemicals), additives for modification of polymer properties,
and their application in electronic and optical devices is due to
the importance of stereochemistry1 the
endeavors in which have afforded an impressive number of Nobel prizes
in chemistry.2 In medicine, an ever-growing
number of therapeutic agents in optically pure form and superior efficacy
than their racemic mixtures are becoming available (e.g., esomeprazole, S-citalopram, etc.).3,4 Accordingly, market
approvals of enantiopure drugs are increasing with concomitant decrease
in approvals for racemic mixture of drugs.5 In 2016, 58% of the drugs on the market were enantiopure compared
to 8% racemic, with the remainder of 34% as achiral molecules.3−6 Also, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recommended the
assessment of stereoisomers of drug candidates during the course of
new drug development.7,8

In light of the above findings,
the synthesis of enantiopure compounds
has been a continuing challenge to chemists9−11 and has resulted
in tremendous advances in asymmetric synthesis.1,7,12−15 Nonetheless, the preparation
of a racemic mixtures followed by their resolution remains a straightforward
alternative that is used extensively in the chemical industry, especially
when a stereospecific synthesis is not available; both enantiomers
are required or the unwanted enantiomer can be converted to the desired
one by simple chemical processing.16,17

Since
the first separation of enantiomers by Louis Pasteur in 1848,18 a continuous search for new and efficient resolution
procedures has been carried out,19 and
many ingenious methods have been reported.20−25 To name a few, this includes the use of optically active resolving
agents such as α-phenylethanesulfonic acid,26d- or l-phenyl glycine,27R-mandelic acid,28,29 cinchona, and other alkaloids,30 polymers
with chiral moieties such as poly-(N-methacryloyl-d-lysine),31 poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N-R or S-sec-butylacrylamide),32 polymer with chiral selector d-(−)-ditoluoyl
tartaric acid,33 and lysine-bearing vinyl
monomer (S)-2-(tert-butoxycarbonylamino)-6-(4′-vinylbenzamido)hexanoic
acid.34 All of the reported methods are
based on the formation of salt pair complexes between a resolving
agent (itself a chiral molecule) and both enantiomers.20−34 Such complexes are endowed with two or more chiral centers and can
therefore be thought of as diastereomers, which are known to have
different physical properties and are therefore separable from one
another by precipitation in a suitable solvent under appropriate conditions.
The preference for crystallization of one salt pair over the other
one is based on a lower free energy of formation.35−39 This is followed by separation from the solution
and subsequent liberation of the enantiomer from the isolated complex.

The two determining factors in a successful resolution of enantiomers
are the choice of the proper resolving agent and a suitable solvent
for crystallization. Chiral acids are valuable tools for the resolution
of racemic amines and chiral amines are used for the resolution of
enantiomeric acids. Salt formation per se does not result in resolution,
which depends on the secondary parameters such as van der Waals and
Coulombic interactions, H-bonding, and covalent derivative formation.19,35 However, most of the reported resolution methods are cumbersome
and require multistage and complicated operations with limitations
for industrial-scale resolution. Furthermore, the purified product
usually requires further cycles of resolution to obtain the desirable
optical purity. Consequently, besides the traditional well-known acid
and amine resolving agents, the quest for new useful compounds with
chiral moieties incorporated in their structures continues40 and it is desirable to have an efficient and
simple process for the resolution of racemic mixtures that is easily
scalable to industrial production.

PEGylation is the process
of attaching strands of the poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG) to various molecules to endow them with new physicochemical
properties. It has been applied successfully to peptides, proteins,
and antibody fragments to improve the safety and efficiency of biopharmaceuticals
by causing changes in conformation, electrostatic binding, hydrophobicity,
etc.41 PEGylation of therapeutic agent
can increase their systemic retention, influence their binding affinity
to cell receptors, and alter their absorption and distribution patterns.42 PEG has been also used extensively for protein
precipitation in the production of various biopharmaceuticals such
as monoclonal antibodies.43 However, the
use of PEG-assisted resolution of racemic mixtures has not been reported.

2 Results and Discussion
The most fundamental aspect
of classical resolution is the salt
formation between an amine and an acid. For example, when (l)-phenylalanine methyl ester was used as the resolving agent for
the resolution of a racemic mixture of mandelic acid in diethyl ether,
both diastereomeric salt pairs (R)-mandelic acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester and (S)-mandelic
acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester precipitated immediately
in equal quantities (Section 3.10). This is due to the fact that both precipitates are
kinetic products with little or no difference in their free energies
of formation.35−37 On the other hand, when the above experiment was
carried out in ethanol, only (R)-mandelic acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester was reported to precipitate after
24 h at 0 °C.44 This demonstrates
the importance of the solvent in obtaining the thermodynamic product,
the formation of which involves a number of factors other than simple
salt formation. These include van der Waals and Coulombic interactions
as well as H-bonding, ultimately resulting in more densely packed
crystals with a lower lattice free energy and a higher thermodynamic
stability.35−37 Therefore, ethanol is a “suitable”
solvent in the above example because it allows for these interactions
to come into play, affording the lower energy complex as the desired
precipitate.35−39

It is clear from the above discussion that traditional resolution
is achieved by free energy-dependent preferential crystallization
of one diastereomeric salt pair over the other. This is time consuming
and cumbersome because the suitable solvent as well as appropriate
conditions for crystallization must be identified to afford the thermodynamic
product. It would therefore be very desirable to expedite the process
of precipitation of the desired enantiomer without affecting the enantiomeric
recognition of the resolving agent. The present work is the result
of endowment of known resolving agents with the physicochemical properties
of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), which has afforded a new class of
resolving agents with the retention of the original enantiomer recognition
property as well as phase-transition properties unique to PEG. The
properties of PEG imparted to the PEGylated resolving agents include
phase transition of the complex from solution to solid by reducing
the temperature in alcohols or by the addition of salt in water. The
new resolving agents greatly facilitate the process of resolution
of enantiomers. Their synthesis and utilization is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Racemic resolution of dl-amino acid methyl ester by PEGylated-(α)-hydroxy
or amino acids.

Poly(ethylene glycol)-10 000
(I) (PEG-10 000) is
activated with thionyl chloride, and the activated PEG (II) is condensed
with an optically pure resolving agent such as (α)-hydroxy-
or -amino acid (III) through the hydroxy or the amine function of
the resolving agent to afford optically pure PEGylated-(α)-hydroxy
acid or PEGylated-(α)-amino acid (IV). In the general procedure
for resolution, the optically pure PEGylated resolving agent (IV)
is dissolved in methanol and racemic mixture of an amine such as dl-phenylalanine methyl ester (V) is added. The mixture is stirred
for 4 h at room temperature and then cooled to 0–5 °C
for 1 h, resulting in temperature-assisted phase transition of the
desired diastereomeric salt pair in a few minutes (Section 3.5). The precipitate is isolated
by filtration and the product is acidified with concentrated hydrochloric
acid to liberate the desired phenylalanine methyl ester in good yields
and good optical purity (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). The use of three different amines demonstrated
the general applicability and scope of the method. Data on the resolution
of the amines tested by this process are presented in the table below.
The products can be subjected to another resolution cycle to increase
their optical purity (vide infra).

6	PEGylated-(l)-valine	(rac)-1-phenylethylamine	MeOH	–19.1	80	76	 	(47)	
The above table demonstrates that the racemic mixtures
of phenylalanine
methyl ester, 2-amino-1-butanol, and 1-phenylethylamine are resolved
with PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid and PEGylated-l-valine in good yields and with high enantiomeric excess in
methanol. Also, improvement in % ee of resolved phenylalanine methyl
ester, 2-amino-1-butanol and 1-phenylethylamine were achieved by an
additional cycle of resolution with PEGylated-(R)-mandelic
acid (Table 1). Furthermore,
other investigators have reported improvement of % ee of amines from
96 to >99% by simple salt formation.48

It is interesting to note that the classical resolution of
a racemic
mixture of phenylalanine methyl ester with (R)-mandelic
acid in methanol did not result in the precipitate formation even
after standing at −15 °C for 24 h. However, the use of
PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid as the resolving agent
in methanol afforded PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester after cooling for a few minutes
(Section 3.5). Water
may also be used as a solvent. However, in contrast to methanol, the
phase transition of the PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester salt pair could not be achieved
by cooling and required the addition of ammonium sulfate (Section 3.7), which is
known to result in the precipitation of PEG.49,50

As indicated above, there are numerous interactions that come
into
play during the process of diastereomeric salt formation and precipitation.
This is further complicated by the nature of the solvent used.51 Moreover, it has been reported that the functionalization
of resolving agents increases their rigidity, which in turn affords
a higher enantiomeric excess of the product.48 It should be noted that PEGylation, which can be considered as macromolecular
functionalization of the resolving agent, does not affect the resolution
characteristic of the resolving agent. It simply simplifies and expedites
the process of precipitation. As indicated above, Wong44 has reported the formation of (R)-mandelic acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester diastereomeric
salt in ethanol after 24 h at 0 °C. The same diastereomeic salt
is also formed when PEGylated (R)-mandelic acid was
used (Section 3.5). Furthermore, in the latter case, salt formation occurred in a
few minutes at 0 °C.

It should also be emphasized that
the resolution efficiency of
various resolving agents is conveyed to their PEGylated analogues.
For example, (R)-mandelic acid is known to be a better
resolving agent for the resolution of amino acid esters than valine52 and this was also observed in terms of a better
resolution efficiency of PEGylated mandelic acid over PEGylated valine.
The (l)-phenylalanine methyl ester liberated from the above
PEGylated complexes by acid treatment had optical purities of 85%
using PEGylated (R)-mandelic acid and 75% using PEGylated l-valine (Table 1 and Sections 3.5 and 3.6).

Excellent mass balance
corresponding to optical rotation of the
enantiomers was observed in all of the cases discussed above in that
the filtrate in each case contained the other diastereomeric salt
pair. For example, acid treatment of the filtrate in entries 1 and
2 of the table liberated (d)-phenylalanine methyl ester hydrochloride
with an optical purity of 85 and 75%, demonstrating equal and opposite
optical rotation to the optical purity of the product obtained from
precipitation.

Our results demonstrate that imparting the unique
characteristics
of PEG to various resolving agents expedites the process of crystallization
of the desired enantiomer. For example, when classic resolution of
a racemic mixture of phenylalanine methyl ester was carried out with
(R)-mandelic acid in methanol, no precipitate was
formed even after 1 week at −15 °C (Section 3.9). However, the use of PEGylated
(R)-mandelic acid expedites the crystallization process
as shown in Section 3.5 (methanol: 0–5 °C, 5 min). In the aqueous medium, immediate
precipitation of the desired salt pair was observed upon the addition
of ammonium sulfate (Section 3.7).

The use of acetonitrile, tetrahydrofuran,
ethyl acetate, dioxane,
halogenated solvents, or water did not result in the precipitation
of the PEGylated diastereomeric complex by cooling of the mixture.
However, methanol or ethanol afforded the complex as a precipitate
at 0–5 °C. Aqueous solutions of PEG are known to precipitate
by the addition of salts,49,50 a property imparted
to the PEGylated resolving agent (vide supra). The underlying principle
for slat-assisted phase transition of PEG from solution to solid in
the aqueous solution has been proposed to be the interference of the
added salt in the H-bond formation between the numerous oxygens of
the polyether and the water molecules surrounding PEG. It has been
suggested that such interference results in an increase in the local
concentration of PEG and this in turn causes its precipitation in
the aqueous medium.51

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Material and Methods
PEG was obtained
from Kimiagaran Emrouz Ltd., Arak, Iran. All of the reagents were
obtained from commercially available sources such as Sigma-Aldrich
or Merck and were used without further purification. Thin-layer chromatography
was performed using E. Merck silica gel 60 F254 precoated plates (0.25
mm). 1H NMR spectra were measured in CDCl3 with
a Bruker DRX-500 Avance spectrometer at 500.13 MHz. Mass spectra were
recorded on a Finnigan-Matt 8430 mass spectrometer operating at an
ionization potential of 70 eV, and the Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectra were recorded on Avatar 360 FT-IR spectrometer. Specific
optical rotation was performed with Antonpar model MCP 200 using sodium
lamp D-line wavelength.

3.2 Preparation of Activated
PEG (Chlorination
of PEG)
PEG (10 000) (50 g, 5 mmol) was dissolved
in 500 mL of toluene, followed by the distillation of 100 mL of the
solvent to remove traces of moisture. After cooling to 35 °C,
freshly distilled anhydrous triethylamine (3.75 mL, 27 mmol) was added.
Freshly distilled thionyl chloride (1.5 mL, 21 mmol), dissolved in
20 mL of dry toluene, was then added dropwise over 1 h at 35 °C
under a dry nitrogen atmosphere with continuous stirring. The mixture
was refluxed for 1 h and triethylammonium hydrochloride was removed
by passing the hot solution through a bed of Celite. The solution
was treated with 5 g of decolorizing carbon at 50 °C and filtrated
over Celite. The filtrate was stored at 4 °C overnight, affording
activated PEG, which was filtered at 4 °C. The solid product
was further purified by dissolving in 2.5 L of absolute ethanol at
60 °C and treating with 30 g of decolorizing carbon, followed
by filtration over Celite. The ethanolic filtrate was stored overnight
at 4 °C. The solid material was separated by filtration and washed
with cold ethanol and then ether. After drying in a vacuum desiccator,
49 g of a pale yellow product was obtained (97%).

3.3 Preparation of PEGylated-(R)-Mandelic Acid
(R)-Mandelic acid (0.6
g, 4 mmol) was dissolved in 200 mL of acetonitrile, followed by the
addition of potassium carbonate (1.1 g, 8 mmol). Activated PEG (10 000)
(20 g, 2 mmol), prepared in Section 3.2 was dissolved in 50 mL of acetonitrile
and added dropwise over 30 min with continuous stirring at 25 °C.
Thereafter, the resulting pale yellow solution was stirred at reflux
for 24 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled to ambient temperature
and adjusted to pH 2–3 using concentrated hydrochloric acid.
This solution was treated with decolorizing charcoal and filtered
over a layer of Celite. The filtrate was evaporated under reduced
pressure to obtain a solid that dissolved in methanol and stored at
4 °C overnight. The solid material was separated by filtration
and washed with cold methanol and then ether. After drying in a vacuum
desiccator, 18 g of a pale yellow product was obtained (88%). The
product was characterized by NMR and mass spectra. 1H NMR
(500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 3.57 (s, nCH2), 7.21–7.40 (m, 10H of Ar), 9.22 (bs, OH), 5.12 (s,
CH). MS (EI) m/z: 152 (15), 107
(80), 79 (100).

3.4 Preparation of PEGylated-(l)-Valine
l-Valine (0.469 g, 4 mmol) was dissolved
in 200 mL of
acetonitrile. Triethylamine (1.11 mL, 8 mmol) was added to the reaction
mixture. Activated PEG (10 000) (20 g, 2 mmol), prepared in Section 3.2, was dissolved
in 50 mL of acetonitrile and added dropwise to the reaction mixture
with continuous stirring at 30 °C. The resulting yellow solution
was stirred at room temperature for 24 h and then treated with decolorizing
charcoal and filtered over a layer of Celite. The filtrate was evaporated
under reduced pressure to obtain a solid, which was dissolved in methanol
and the solution was stored at 4 °C. The solid material was separated
by filtration and washed with cold methanol and then ether. After
drying in a vacuum desiccator, 18.5 g of a pale yellow product was
obtained (90%). The product was characterized by NMR and mass spectra. 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 0.98 (m, 2CH3), 2.63 (m, CH(CH3)2), 3.59 (s, nCH2), 3.59 (m, CH(NH)). MS (EI) m/z: 116 (15), 72
(100), 55 (76), 43 (62).

3.5 General Procedure for the
Resolution of Racemic
Amines with PEGylated-(R)-Mandelic Acid
PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid (10 g, 1 mmol) was dissolved
in 50 mL methanol followed by the addition of racemic mixture of the
amine (2 mmol) and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for
12 h. It was then cooled to 0–5 °C and stirred for 1 h.
A voluminous precipitate of white solids was formed, followed by the
addition of 20 mL cold methanol. The slurry was filtered and the cake
was washed with 10 mL cold methanol to afford a white solid consisting
of optically impure PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid–(R or S)-amine. The cake was then dissolved
in 50 mL methanol and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid
and cooled to 0–5 °C. The resulting white solid was filtered
and washed with 10 mL cold methanol. The filtrate was evaporated under
reduced pressure to dryness at 50 °C to afford (R or S)-amine hydrochloride. Yields and optical purities
are shown in Table 1.

3.6 General Procedure for the Resolution of Racemic
Amines with PEGylated-(l)-Valine
Using the method
of Section 3.5, PEGylated-(l)-valine was used for resolving of racemic amines. Yields and
optical purities are shown in Table 1.

3.7 Ammonium Sulfate-Assisted
Resolution of Racemic
Phenylalanine Methyl Ester with PEGylated-(l)-Mandelic Acid
in Water
PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid (10
g, 1 mmol) and racemic phenylalanine methyl ester (0.36 g, 2 mmol)
were added to 50 mL water and the mixture was stirred at room temperature
for 12 h. The resulting mixture was cooled to 0–5 °C and
stirred for 1 h. Unlike Section 3.5, no precipitation occurred. Solid ammonium sulfate
(34.85 g, 0.26 mol) was added to the mixture. After 1 h, a voluminous
precipitate of a white solid occurred. The slurry was filtered and
the cake was washed with 10 mL saturated ammonium sulfate. The cake,
which consisted of optically impure PEGylated-(R)-mandelic
acid–(l)-phenylalanine methyl ester, was dissolved
in 50 mL water and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid and
stirred for 1 h to liberate (l)-phenylalanine methyl ester
hydrochloride. Dry ammonium sulfate was then added to the resulting
solution to precipitate PEGylated (R)-mandelic acid,
which was filtered and the cake washed with 10 mL saturated ammonium
sulfate. The filtrate was adjusted to pH 7 using sodium bicarbonate
(1 M) to neutralize (l)-phenylalanine methyl ester. The resulting
white precipitate was filtered, washed with 5 mL water, and dried
to afford 0.20 g of optically impure (d)-phenylalanine methyl
ester (yield: 93%). Specific optical rotation of +24 (EtOH, c = 2) was obtained, corresponding to 75% of theory.

3.8 Improvement of Optical Purity by an Additional
Cycle of Resolution
A mixture of PEGylated-(R)-mandelic acid (5 g, 0.5 mmol), optically impure (R or S)-amine (Table 1, 1.0 mmol), and 25 mL methanol was stirred at room
temperature for 12 h and then cooled to 0–5 °C with stirring
for 1 h. A voluminous white precipitate was formed, followed by the
addition of 20 mL cold methanol. The slurry was filtered and washed
with 10 mL cold methanol. The resulting white solid was dissolved
in 50 mL methanol and acidified with concentrated hydrochloric acid
to pH = 2–3 and cooled to 0–5 °C. The white solid
was filtered and washed with 10 mL cold methanol. The filtrate was
evaporated to dryness at 50 °C under vacuum to afford (R or S)-amine hydrochloride with improved
% ee (87, 91, and 95% for 2-amino-1-butanol, 1-phenylethylamine, and
phenylalanine methyl ester, respectively).

3.9 Indiscriminate
Precipitation of l- and d-Phenylalanine Methyl Ester–(R)-Mandelic
Acid Salt Pairs in Diethyl Ether
To a solution of racemic
mixture of phenylalanine methyl ester (0.72 g, 4 mmol) in diethyl
ether (10 mL) was added (R)-mandelic acid (0.6 g,
4 mmol). A white precipitate formed immediately and the mixture was
stirred at room temperature for an hour. The mixture was then adjusted
to pH 8 using 1 M solution of sodium bicarbonate to afford a biphasic
mixture. The organic phase was washed with 5 mL water and dried over
MgSO4. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure to
afford 0.72 g racemic phenylalanine methyl. This is equal to the quantity
of racemic mixture of phenylalanine methyl ester used, indicating
indiscriminate precipitation of l- and d-phenylalanine
methyl ester–(R)-mandelic acid complexes in
diethyl ether.

3.10 Indiscriminate Precipitation
of R- and S-Mandelic Acid–(l)-Phenylalanine
Methyl Ester Complexes in Diethyl Ether
The procedure of Section 3.9 was followed
using (0.6 g, 4 mmol) a racemic mixture of mandelic acid, which afforded
0.6 g racemic mandelic acid. Again, this is equal to the quantity
of racemic mixture of mandelic acid used, indicating indiscriminate
precipitation of l- and d-phenylalanine methyl ester–(R)-mandelic acid complexes in diethyl ether.
