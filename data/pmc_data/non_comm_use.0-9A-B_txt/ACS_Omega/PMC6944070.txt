This study is performed to characterize moderate or intense low-oxygen dilution (MILD)
combustion (MC) versus conventional combustion (CC) of a premixed CH4/air jet
flame in a hot coflow under identical inlet and ambient conditions. The present CC and
MC correspond to the cases using a bluff-body (BB) and a no bluff-body (NBB),
respectively. It is demonstrated that the NBB combustion develops by entraining ambient
hot low-oxygen gas so as to dilute the reactant mixture and simultaneously heat up
beyond the minimum autoignition temperature (Tai), leading
to the MC. By contrast, in the BB case, the conventional flame is established and
stabilized by a steady heat source of the recirculation zone (RZ) behind the BB with
highly intense mixing and rapid ignition. A large reaction zone with uniform temperature
distribution (i.e., low temperature rise) is found in the MC mode, while the CC has a
much smaller size of the intense reaction zone with the concentrated high temperature
and species distributions. Significantly, it has been first revealed that, in the BB
case, there is a secondary combustion in the MC mode formed far downstream from the BB
flame under the environmental condition of a high-temperature hot coflow.

1 Introduction
Conventional combustion (CC) of fossil fuels has been continuously emitting carbon dioxide
(CO2), nitric oxides (NOx), and fine particles
(PM), causing a serious threat to human life.1 This calls for an urgent
action to take for avoiding or reducing such a threat! Moderate or intense low-oxygen
dilution (MILD) combustion2 (MC) has been found to be one of the most
promising technologies to support this action. This mode of combustion can achieve high
thermal efficiency of combustion systems and simultaneously low pollutant emissions. Of
note, the like of MC may be named flameless oxidation (FLOX)3 or
high-temperature air combustion (HiTAC).4 Despite being differently
named, they are all similarly realized by re-circulating combustion products into the
incoming fresh air and fuel efficiently. Relative to the conventional combustion (CC), a
strong mixing between reactants and flue gases slows down various combustion reactions, thus
substantially dropping local peak temperatures of combustion, thereby reducing
NOx emissions.3,4 Other distinct characteristics, such as no visible flame and
enhanced radiation efficiency, are also found in this mode of combustion.4

To differentiate MC and CC in the flame establishment, combustion characteristics, and
pollution emissions clearly, a number of previous investigations have been carried out
experimentally3,5−13 and
numerically2,14−21 since the
discovery of MC. Wünning et al.3 defined MC as a low
NOx emission technology by experiment. They also
distinguished MC and CC by the exhaust gas recirculation rate Kv
and furnace temperature Tfur (or combustion system temperature),
where Kv is defined
as 1  Here,
mr, ma, and
mf are the mass fluxes of the recirculated exhaust gas,
oxidant, and fuel, respectively. Wünning et al.3 found that, for
the methane combustion, MC can be established only when two conditions are satisfied: (i)
Kv > 3.5 and (ii) Tfur > 850
°C. By contrast, CC is for Kv < 0.75. It followed that
Plessing et al.5 realized MC in a combustion chamber with highly
preheated air and strong exhaust gas recirculation. Using ambient air (≈300 K) at
high recirculation rates, Kumar et al.6,7 achieved MC at high heat release rate up to 10 MW/m3 in a 3
kW furnace. They also proposed a new scaling criterion for the burners operated in MC mode
based on the heat release rate and reactant mixing time. Dally et al.8
studied MC in a CH4/H2 jet in hot coflow (JHC) burner and found that
the MC could be established with a low-oxygen hot coflow. Then, Dally et al.9 and Szegö et al.10,11 investigated MC in lab-scale furnaces under different fuel
dilution, air preheating, and heat extraction conditions. They found that dilution of the
fuel jet with inert gas (CO2 or N2) could help achieve MC and reduce
NOx emissions due to the high scalar dissipation near the
fuel jet. Besides, the fuel jet momentum was found to be dominant for the MC establishment
in their experiments. Mi et al.12 then achieved the premixed MC by
increasing the momentum rate of the fully/partially premixed reactant jet in the same
furnace as in Szegö et al.10,11 They discovered that there was a critical inlet jet momentum rate for
the geometry used by them, below which MC cannot be achieved. Recently, Cheong et al.13 found through experiments that the distance between fuel and air jet nozzles
is also crucial for realizing MC in the furnace. The separation controls both the mixing of
the fuel and oxidant jets themselves and their mixing with the flue gas, thus influencing
combustion reaction rates.

In a separate study, Cavaliere et al.2 compared MC and CC in a
well-stirred reactor (WSR) by varying the inflow temperature
(Tin). They defined the MC mode as a combustion process where
Tin > Tai>
ΔTmax, in which Tai is the
autoignition temperature and ΔTmax =
Tmax – Tin is the maximum
temperature rise due to combustion. Wang et al.14 developed this
definition to classify the combustion of a CH4/O2/N2
mixture in a WSR into several regimes [CC, MC, high-temperature combustion (HTC), etc.]
based on a three-dimensional plot of Tin, N2 mole
fraction (XN2), and equivalence ratio (Φ).
They15 also used this method to identify MC and TC in the JHC burner of
Dally et al.8 based on the coflow temperature
(TC) and oxygen mole fraction
(XO2,C). Mei et al.16,17 investigated the reaction zone
dimensions of MC and TC in the same JHC burner by varying TC,
XO2,C, coflow velocity
(VC), and coflow diluent (N2 and CO2).
They pointed out that MC is characterized by a large reaction zone and weak chemical
reactions and the oxy-fuel (CO2-diluted) reaction zone is much larger than the
air-fuel (N2-diluted) counterpart. More recently, large eddy simulation
(LES)18,19 and direct
numerical simulation (DNS)20,21 were also utilized to differentiate the small-scale characteristics of
MC and TC by varying the dilution level, and it was found that MC is characterized by
autoignition, a small scalar gradient, and distributed reactions, while TC has a larger
scalar gradient and thin flame sheets.

The previous studies2−21 mainly focused on how external conditions, such as jet
conditions (e.g., fuel type, oxygen mole fraction, temperature, inlet momentum rate, nozzle
separation, etc.) and outer boundary wall conditions (e.g., temperature, heat transfer
rate), would influence the combustion. It may lead to the misconception that these two modes
of combustion are so distinct that they cannot be achieved under the same inlet and
environmental conditions. This stimulates this work to study whether a change of internal
flow structure individually, without changing inlet and boundary conditions, can cause
differences in the flame mode. Previously, the internal flow structure was always treated as
a dependent variable that changes with varying jet and coflow
conditions.5−21 In this sense, the effect
of the flow structure on the establishment of two combustion modes under identical
conditions deserves a study. Moreover, in the past studies,5−21 CC was realized by reducing the jet momentum rate or
reducing the diluent or even eliminating it. However, in practical applications, CC is
commonly achieved by flame stabilizers such as a bluff-body (BB) or
swirler.22−27 In addition, previous works were focused mainly
on nonpremixed MC,5−11,15−19
while a few works have been performed on premixed MC in hot (flue gas) coflow. Note that the
premixed combustion is very important in fundamental research and applications. Therefore,
in this work, MC and CC in a premixed JHC burner are investigated together. Specifically, a
bluff-body (BB) is placed downstream near the nozzle exit to vary the internal flow
structure to realize CC, while it is taken away to develop MC, both under identical inlet
and ambient conditions.

When the BB is set near the nozzle exit, the premixed reactant jet will rapidly slow down
and a recirculation zone (RZ) with negative velocity will develop behind the BB. In this
situation, when the mixture in the RZ is ignited with an external heat source (e.g., spark
electrode), the strong mixing between the RZ and the oncoming premixed reactants in the
shear layer will be continuously ignited, finally developing a conventional BB
flame.22−24 Without BB, the mixture
jet will directly flow downstream and be gradually diluted and heated by entraining the
surrounding exhaust gas with low oxygen, finally establishing MC.8,15−17

In this context, this work investigates these two modes of combustion (MC and CC) with the
same inlet and outer surrounding conditions. Specifically, the aim of the investigation is
to distinguish the two modes in the flow field, combustion establishment process, and
spatial distributions of the mean temperature and various species concentrations.

2 Computational Details
2.1 Numerical Conditions
Present numerical calculations are partly validated using the experimental results of
Cabra et al.,28 who measured the temperature and various species
(O2, CH4, N2, H2, CO, OH, etc.) of a
premixed CH4/air jet flame in a hot vitiated coflow. Their combustion was not
in the MC mode but developed through autoignition,29 whose ignition
mechanism is very similar to that of MC. Therefore, this configuration is suitable not
only for the validation of the present modeling but also for the comparison between
turbulent premixed MC and CC of a jet flame. The Cabra burner28
consisted of a central jet nozzle of inner diameter d = 4.57 mm
surrounded by a hot vitiated coflow, which initially flowed in an annular tube of diameter
210 mm. The jet exit velocity was 100 m/s, corresponding to a Reynolds number
(Re) of about 28 000. The vitiated coflow, with temperature 1350
K and velocity 5.4 m/s, was the combustion product of 2200 lean premixed H2/air
flames generated from a perforated plate in the annular tube. Thus, it was a mixture of
O2, N2, and H2O.

Moreover, to examine the applicability of the present numerical models to BB flames, the
premixed BB flame experiments conducted by Kariuki et al.26 are also
considered. In this configuration, the premixed jet nozzle has a diameter of 35 mm and a
45° half-angle BB (diameter dk = 25 mm) at the nozzle
exit and was put in static ambient air at room temperature (300 K). The bulk velocity at
the nozzle exit was 21.6 m/s and the corresponding Reynolds number was about
34 000, comparable with that of the Cabra experiments.28

The Cabra burner28 is chosen for numerical simulations of this work
for comparing MC and CC, while a conical BB is set at 1.0d behind the jet
exit to create a RZ and realize the CC in the BB case. The velocities of the central jet
and the hot coflow are reduced to 50 and 1 m/s, to avoid blowing off. Moreover, the coflow
oxygen concentration is decreased to 6% to establish MC in the no bluff-body (NBB) case.
Table 1 shows all of the detailed conditions of
the central premixed jet and the hot coflow for the present calculations and those
experiments.26,28

Due to the symmetry of the combustion systems, a two-dimensional computational domain,
shown in Figure 1, is selected for the present
calculations to save the cost of computation. The radial length of the computational
domain is 200 mm, and the axial length is 1000 mm downstream from the jet inlet. The
zero-shear stress wall boundary is set at the sides, and the pressure boundary of 1 atm is
set at the outlet. After verifying the grid independency, a structured mesh with about
14 000 cells is chosen for the model validation of the Cabra experiments28 and the NBB case, and a mesh with about 20 000 cells is chosen for
the BB case. Note that the grid number of the latter is comparable with that for the
validation of the Kariuki experiments,26 indicating that 20000 cells
are sufficient for modeling the flow and combustion in such unconfined BB flames. The
minimum mesh scale in the BB case is 0.033 mm × 0.044 mm and 0.285 mm × 0.42 mm
in the NBB case.

et al.28 and the NBB case and (b) BB case and (c) experimental
validation of Kariuki et al.26 The unit is millimeter.

2.2 Computational Models
To predict the turbulence, reaction, and their interactions correctly in the two
combustion regimes, we require appropriate models for turbulence, species transport,
radiation, and chemical reactions. Based on the past studies,15−17,28−42 the models chosen presently are shown
below.

In consideration of the accuracy and cost of calculations, one of the two-equation
turbulent models, i.e., the k–ε model,30
is commonly used in numerical simulations. However, previous studies15−17 found that the standard k–ε model cannot
achieve ideal results for turbulent round jets. Thus, this study adjusts the constant
Cε1 from 1.44 to 1.6, which has been proved feasible
for a better prediction for such turbulent round jet flows.31

The compositional probability density function (PDF) model is used as the combustion
model, which can well describe the interactions between turbulence and chemical reactions
in both MC34,35 and
CC.36,37 In this
model, the joint PDF is applied to the Reynolds-averaged species and energy equations. The
PDF equations derived from the N–S equations are shown
below 2  where P is the Favre joint PDF
composition, ρ is the fluid density, Vi is the mean
fluid velocity along the i direction, Sk is
the reaction rate for species k, ψ is the composition space vector,
vi′ is the velocity fluctuation vector
along the i direction, and
Ji,k is the vector for
molecular diffusion flux. In eq 2, the three terms
on the left-hand side are closed, while the terms on the right-hand side are not and
require modeling. The turbulent scalar flux (first term on the right) is closed by the
gradient-diffusion
assumption 3  where μt and
Sct are turbulent viscosity and Schmidt number,
respectively. The second term on the right-hand side of eq 2 is the molecular mixing term, which also needs to be closed. Compared with the
interaction by exchange with the mean (IEM)38 and the Euclidean minimum
spanning tree (EMST)38 models, modified curl (M-Curl)39 mixing model was found to be a better choice for modeling the molecular
mixing for turbulent combustion.28,29 This is also confirmed by the present calculations in Section 3. To reduce the computational cost, the in situ
adaptive tabulation (ISAT) model40 is used, and the ISAT error
tolerance is set at 10–6 to ensure the accuracy of the calculations.
Besides, the number of particles in each cell is set to 30. For the M-Curl model, some of
the particle pairs are selected randomly from all of the particles in a cell, and its
Favre-mean composition φ is changed
as 4   5  where φi and
φj are compositional vectors, m is
the mass for each particle, and ξ is a number selected randomly.

This study applies DRM-22, a chemical kinetic mechanism41 simplified
from GRI-Mech 1.2, a detailed mechanism;42 note that DRM-22 contains 22
species and 104 reversible reactions. This simplified mechanism was found41 to predict adiabatic flame propagation velocity and ignition delay well.
In addition, the discrete ordinate (DO) radiation model with the weighted sum of the gray
gas model (WSGGM) is utilized to consider the influence of radiation.

The commercial CFD package Fluent is used to solve the transport equations. The
second-order upwind scheme is taken to improve the accuracy of calculation. The SIMPLE
algorithm method is utilized to solve the coupling of pressure and velocity. Two criteria
are used to determine whether the convergence is obtained. The first one is that the
numerical residuals are less than 10–6 for energy and radiation and
10–5 for other variables. The second is to ensure that the
surface-averaged temperature and velocity at the downstream outlet vary within 1.0 K and
0.1 m/s, respectively.

3 Validation of the Computational Models
Figure 2 displays the numerical predictions of the
centerline temperatures and concentrations of some typical species using the M-Curl, EMST,
and IEM models against the experimental results of Cabra et al.28
Presented on the plots are the results of the Favre-averaged temperature
(T) and its root-mean-square (rms) value (T′),
mixture fraction (f), and species concentrations
(Ym, where m = CH4, O2, CO,
CO2, OH, and H2) along the jet centerline. Note that the mixture
fraction was defined by Bilger et al.43
as 6  where
M stands for the elemental mass and Y represents the
mass fraction of these elements (carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen). The subscripts 1 and 2
denote those quantities related to the central jet and annular coflow, respectively.

Figure 2 Centerline Favre-averaged and fluctuating temperatures and Favre-averaged mixture
fraction and concentrations of CH4, O2, CO, CO2, OH,
and H2 predicted using the M-Curl, EMST, and IEM mixing models versus the
measurements of Cabra et al.28 (black triangular).

Evidently, in Figure 2, the use of the M-Curl
model predicts better than the other two mixing models, with respect to the measurements.
Specifically, in the EMST and IEM models, the earlier occurrence of combustion reactions is
predicted, hence leading to earlier growths of the centerline temperature, CO,
CO2, and H2. Perhaps, due to the overestimation of the mixing rate,
the simulated temperatures from the EMST and IEM models are higher in the mixing layer,
hence causing early ignition. In this context, the M-Curl model is chosen as the mixing
model for this study, whose results are presented below and in the next section.

Using the M-Curl model, the predictions of the centerline T,
T′, and Ym (where m = CH4,
O2, CO, CO2, OH, and H2) can act to validate the
modeling. To enhance the validation, Figure 3
presents the radial profiles of the predicted and measured T,
T′, and f at
x/d = 15, 30, 40, 50, and 70. In general, the
simulations agree reasonably well with the measurements. Specifically, the predictions of
the centerline T, f,
YCO2, YCH4,
and YO2 nearly perfectly match their measured values
at x/d ≤ 80. By comparison, the centerline profiles
of T′, YCO,
YH2, and YOH are not
predicted so well. Overestimations of YCO,
YH2, and YOH occur at
x/d > 60. At x/d
> 80, due to the coflow velocity decay, outer cold air can enter the inner combustion
region,28 thus causing a lower measured temperature and higher values
of YO2. The dilution effect of outer air would also
reduce the measured concentrations of minor species.

Figure 3 Present predictions of T, T′, and
f versus the experimental data of Cabra et al.28
along the radial direction at x/d = 15, 30, 40, 50,
and 70.

In addition, the present model is also validated by the premixed BB flame of Kariuki et
al.26Figure 4 presents the radial profiles of the
calculated and measured axial velocity Vx and progress
variable44 defined by C =
YCO2/YCO2,p,
where YCO2,p is the mass fraction of CO2
in the complete combustion products. Apparently, the present model slightly underestimates
Vx at 0 ≤
r/dk ≤ 0.4 and
x/dk = 0.4 and 0.8, while C
is also underestimated at x/dk < 1.6,
relative to the measurements. Despite the above, the calculations of
Vx and C overall agree reasonably well with
their experimental data. Thus, the Reynolds average Navier Stokes (RANS)-PDF model is also
applicable for premixed BB flames.

Figure 4 Present predictions of axial velocity (Vx) and progress
variable (C) versus the experimental data of Kariuki et al.26 along the radial direction at
x/dk = 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, and 1.6.

To conclude, the computational models of RANS-PDF (with the M-Curl mixing model) work
appropriately in simulating the premixed JHC flame and premixed bluff-body flame, so they
are adequate for use in this study.

4 Results and Discussion
Figure 5 shows the contour distributions of the
Favre-averaged temperatures (T) for the NBB and BB cases under identical
inlet and coflow conditions. The maximum temperature Tmax is
1604 K in the NBB case, corresponding to a temperature rise
ΔTmax = Tmax –
TC = 354 K (<Tai = 813 K, see
ref (45)). For the BB case,
ΔTmax = 1247 K (>Tai =
813 K). Besides, the coflow temperature (TC = 1250 K) is higher
than Tai for both cases. From the MC
definition,2,15 the
combustion regime for the NBB case is of MC, while that for BB case is of CC.

Figure 5 Contour distributions of the Favre-averaged temperature (T) in the (a)
NBB and (b) BB cases.

In addition, the temperature distributions in Figure 5 show that the CC flame is established immediately downstream from the BB, with
very high local temperature peaks around the boundary of the RZ. In contrast, the MC
develops far downstream and distributes volumetrically with a quasiuniform temperature
distribution of no obvious temperature peaks. Overall, these two modes of combustion are
greatly distinct. The specific differences between the NBB and BB cases in the flow field,
flame establishment, and combustion characteristics are presented below.

4.1 Difference between the NBB and BB Cases in the Flow Field
Figure 6 shows the axial velocity
(Vx) fields of the NBB and BB cases
together with the lateral profiles of Vx at
x/d = 4, 12, 20, and 60 and a few streamlines.
Evidently, in the NBB case, the central jet flow gradually develops downstream, with the
velocity decreasing slowly as x increases. By contrast, the flow field
changes dramatically once a bluff-body is placed near the nozzle exit to make the BB case.
The central premixed reactant mixture flows around the BB, being first divided and then
merged together. A large recirculation zone (RZ; about 5.69d long) is
formed behind the BB, thus changing the flow direction and velocity distribution
significantly. Downstream from the RZ, the central jet velocity first recovers until its
local maximum returns back to locate on the centerline at
x/d ≥ 20 and then turns to decay farther
downstream. To quantitatively show the fundamental difference in the velocity field, Figure 7 presents the centerline axial velocity
variations for the NBB and BB cases. It is evident that the two jets are totally different
at x/d < 30 and appear to become similar at
x/d > 50 gradually. At
x/d > 80, the centerline axial velocity is nearly
equal for the two cases. Similar results can be found in previous
studies.46,47
Esquiva-Dano et al.46 also concluded that under different jet
velocities and BB shapes, the centerline axial velocity (normalized by the jet exit
velocity) in the far downstream area is almost the same. This can be explained. For an
ideal fluid flow around a BB, the flow field can be decomposed to a free flow without BB
and a potential flow caused by the BB (e.g., for cylinder BB, the potential flow is a
dipole flow).48 The potential flow affects only the flow near the BB
and thus the downstream flow is dominated by the free flow. It can be inferred that for
the actual viscous premixed jet, the effect of BB should also be reasonably weak in the
far downstream area; thus, the centerline axial velocity is very similar for the cases of
NBB and BB with different shapes and jet velocities. The results here and in refs (46) and (47)
confirm this point.

(Vx) in the (a) NBB and (b) BB cases.
The solid black lines mark streamlines. The red lines represent lateral distributions
of the axial velocity at x/d = 4, 12, 20, and
60.

Figure 7 Centerline axial velocity (Vx) in the
NBB and BB cases.

Figure 8 shows contours of the dimensionless
gradient of velocity G ≡
|∇·V⃗|d/V (upper
half) and those of turbulence intensity I ≡
v′/V (lower half). Large velocity gradients
occur in the shear layers between the central jet and outer coflow and between the jet and
the RZ. Careful inspections indicate that, in the CC case, G and
I near the RZ boundary are both much larger than those between the
central jet and coflow. In other words, the maxima of G and
I are much greater in the CC case than in the MC case where no BB
exists. Higher velocity gradients are usually supposed to cause a higher turbulent shear
rate and thus stronger molecular-level mixing.49 The mixing intensity
may be reflected by the turbulence intensity I. In the CC case, the
mixing between the reactant mixture and combustion product mixture from the RZ is more
intense (Imax ≈ 12.0) than that between the central jet
and hot coflow (Imax ≈ 7.0) in the MC case. Namely,
relative to the CC case, the mixing occurring between the “cold” premixed
reactants and co-flowing hot flue gases is far weaker in the MC case.

Figure 8 Contour distributions of the nondimensional velocity gradient G
≡
|∇·V⃗|d/V
(upper half) and turbulent intensity I ≡
v′/V (lower half) in the (a) NBB and (b) BB
cases.

Figure 9 shows the contours of the mixture
fraction (f) for the NBB and BB cases. The mixture fraction, as defined
in eq 6, describes the mixing between the central
jet and the coflow. In general, the lower the mixture fraction is, the more the premixed
reactant mixture is diluted by the coflow. In the NBB or MC case, f is
quite low (<0.3) in the reaction zone, which means that the reactant mixture is highly
diluted. This also indicates that the mixedness between the jet and low-oxygen coflow is
the main factor for the MC “flame”.

Figure 9 Contour distributions of the mixture fraction (f) in the (a) NBB and
(b) BB cases. Note that the zone surrounded by the white line is the reaction zone
defined as YCO/YCO,max
≥ 5%.

By comparison, in the BB or CC case, the mixture fraction is substantially higher
(>0.5) in the reaction zone, especially, f > 0.7 in the RZ,
revealing that the CC flame has little to do with the mixing process between the central
jet and the hot coflow. The CC flame depends almost solely on the mixing between the
premixed reactants and the combustion products in the RZ. The reasons for the above
differences will be explained in the next section.

Overall, the presence of a bluff-body changes the flow field considerably, particularly
forming a strong recirculation and thus the reverse flow region. The strong turbulence
mixing between the upcoming reactant mixture, which slows down due to the BB, and the
burning product mixture in the RZ enables both the flame stabilization and rapid
combustion.22−24 Nevertheless, the lifted
MC flame results merely from the reactants being mixed and heated by the hot coflow.

4.2 Difference between the NBB and BB Cases in the Establishment of Combustion
To identify the difference between the MC and CC in their combustion establishment, we
first examined their ignition processes. As one of the most important quantities for the
combustion process, the ignition delay (τig) of the
reactant mixture in each case is investigated. Similar to what has been done by Cabra et
al.,28 the mixture temperatures (Tmix)
and concentrations of the premixed jet (f = 1 and T =
300 K) with the hot coflow (f = 0 and TC =
1250 K) or with the combustion products in the RZ (f = 0.745 and
T = 2280 K) are first obtained for the NBB and BB cases, respectively,
without any chemical reaction. Those temperatures and concentrations are then used to
calculate the ignition delay time (τig) for each case
from the well-stirred reactor (WSR). The calculated results of
Tmix and τig are presented
in Figure 10. As demonstrated clearly,
f and Tmix in the BB case are significantly
higher than those in the NBB case because the mixing process in the former takes place
just behind the BB.

Figure 10 (a) Mixing temperature Tmix and (b) ignition delay
τig for the NBB and BB cases calculated for a
well-stirred reactor (WSR).

In the BB case, an extremely short ignition delay is observed, with the minimum of 9
× 10–5 s. Such a rapid ignition results not only from high mixture
temperatures (≈2300 K) but also from very rapid mixing due to the presence of BB.
However, for the NBB case, the minimum of τig is much
longer (≈2 × 10–2 s) since autoignition is needed for
combustion to sustain. The delay time from the WSR is found close to the ignition time
calculated in the unsteady RANS-PDF calculation shown later in Figure
12.

To further distinguish the MC and CC in their combustion establishment, Figure 11 shows the difference between the turbulent flame
speed (ST) and local axial velocity
(Vx), i.e., (ST –
Vx), in the reaction zone. The turbulent flame can be
stabilized by the balance of its propagation or autoignition. For the flame propagation,
the flame is stabilized in the region where (ST –
Vx) ≈ 0 or ST ≈
Vx. Otherwise, it will propagate upstream or downstream.
For autoignition, the reactant temperature should be higher than
Tai. In the NBB case, the turbulent flame speed is never
larger than the local velocity (ST ≤
Vx). The flame front (if any) propagates only downstream
or “blows out” and is never stabilized. Therefore, the lifted flame can be
stabilized only by autoignition far downstream from the nozzle. In the BB case, the flame
speed behind the BB is much larger than the local speed (ST
≫ Vx). The flame propagates upstream to ignite the
upcoming reactant mixture. Note that the reactant temperature is below
Tai upstream of the flame front (see Figure
5). Thus, the flame is stabilized by flame propagation. There
are two reasons for the differences in flame stabilization between the two cases. First,
the flame temperature in the BB case is much higher than that in the NBB case, which leads
to a larger flame speed (ST) for the CC.1
Second, as is described in Section 4.1, the central velocity decays much more rapidly in the BB case due to
the BB.

Figure 11 Contour distributions of (ST –
Vx) in the reaction zone defined by
YCO/YCO,max ≥ 5% for
the (a) NBB and (b) BB cases, where ST is the turbulent
flame speed and Vx is the local axial velocity.

To differentiate the flame establishments of the two cases, we carried out the unsteady
RANS-PDF calculations for the NBB and BB cases (Figure 12 shows some of the results). The time step
of the calculation is set as 1 × 10–4 s, with other numerical
settings being identical to the steady RANS calculations. In each case, a small region
(1.5 < x/d < 3, 0 <
r/d < 1) is initialized with 1700 K at
t = 0 s, the same as for the steady RANS-PDF calculations of the BB
case. This external “spark” is necessary to establish the BB
combustion50 but unnecessary for the NBB case or MC. It is found that
both cases have nearly reached their statistical steady state at t = 0.1
s.

Figure 12 Instantaneous temperature distributions at t = 0–0.3 s for
the (a) NBB and (b) BB cases. The zones bounded by black lines are regions where
(T – TC) ≥ 10 K.

Figure 12 shows the instantaneous temperature
distributions at several consecutive time instants in the two cases. In the NBB case
(Figure 12a), a temperature increment for
(T – TC) ≥ 10 K does not
appear, and no combustion is supposed to occur, at t ≤ 0.01 s. The
initial heat patched in the tiny region at t = 0 quickly spreads out and
downstream, causing a rapid drop in temperature to TC = 1250
K. No ignition occurs due to the initial spark anywhere in the computational domain. As
time goes on, combustion develops and takes place solely due to autoignition at
x/d ≈ 50–60 or the time
t < 0.02 s, which is the minimum
τig calculated from WSR (see Figure
10). In the WSR system, where reactants are perfectly mixed,
only chemical reactions are simulated, in contrast to the present BB and NBB cases where
the mixing and reaction processes happen simultaneously. Once the autoignition has
occurred, the combustion zone spreads downstream instead of propagating upstream, as shown
at t = 0.02 and 0.03 s, and gradually reaches its steady state. The
initial patch of a tiny high-temperature (1700 K) area has no impact on the final
establishment of a stable MILD combustion (MC).

However, in the BB case, see Figure 12b, a
visible combustion zone or flame is established in a different way. After initializing a
small region with a high temperature of 1700 K or “sparking” behind the BB,
a flame develops gradually downstream of the BB. Then, the upcoming reactant mixture is
ignited rapidly and continuously. It is interesting to find that, at t =
0.0001 s, the high-temperature region behind the BB is very tiny but sufficient to
establish the combustion process. That is, sparking with some heat greater than the
minimum ignition energy can successfully ignite the reactant mixture when there is a BB.
In other words, the key reason for the establishment of this conventional combustion (CC)
is the presence of the BB, behind which a recirculation zone (RZ) is formed, acting as a
heat source for continuous ignition and a flame stabilizer to avoid the flame being blown
off.

Moreover, Figure 12b demonstrates that at
t = 0.025 and 0.03 s some temperature rise takes place in the mixing
layer between the jet and coflow at x/d ≈ 80.
That is, in the BB case, there is also a secondary combustion developing far downstream
due to autoignition, which is similar to that in the NBB case. However, it takes longer
for this ignition because the upstream CC flame consumes most of the reactants.
Presumably, if the CC flame is blown off, the MC should develop quite far downstream as
stable as in the NBB case. It seems that a balance between these two combustion processes
would control the flame characteristics of the BB case. If the conventional flame behind
the BB cannot consume most reactants, the remainder would be consumed by the downstream
MC. When the CC can no longer be stabilized due to some reasons (e.g., a sufficiently high
jet momentum to blow off the flame), the entire combustion would take place downstream in
the MC mode, like the NBB case. Nevertheless, despite its interestingness, this issue is
out of the scope of this work.

To summarize, in the NBB case, the central high-velocity cold reactant mixture entrains
and mixes with the ambient hot flue-gas mixture (coflow). The reactant mixture is thus
gradually heated beyond its autoignition temperature (Tai)
sufficiently downstream, and consequently, the stable MILD combustion is established
slowly and sustains due to autoignition. In contrast, in the BB case, where an ignition is
forced initially, highly strong mixing between the cold reactant mixture and very hot
species in the RZ is the key factor for establishing a stable CC flame. Combustion takes
place rapidly behind the BB due to extremely fast ignition by the recirculated
high-temperature combustion products. Besides, the CC flame has to be integrated with the
downstream secondary combustion of the MC mode. The finding of the secondary combustion in
the MC mode has never been reported in the literature before for the BB case. With this
finding, the use of a BB nozzle is expected to be able to produce the MC by adding some
diluents (exhaust gas) to increase the reactant momentum so that the BB flame is blown
off. In other words, the BB nozzle may achieve both combustion modes by varying the
premixed reactant momentum.

4.3 Difference between the NBB and BB Cases in the Combustion Characteristics
The Favre-averaged temperature distributions for both MC and CC are shown in Figure 5. Evidently, the high-temperature reaction
zone for the CC is concentrated in the RZ behind the BB, while the temperature over the
reaction zone is more uniform for the MC. In particular, the maximum temperature for the
CC is 2497 K, which is about 900 K higher than that for the MC. The rapid ignition process
along with fast reactions and rapid heat release behind the BB is the reason for the
concentrated high-temperature distribution for the CC. In comparison for the MC or NBB
case, the process of establishing combustion is slow due to slow mixing and sufficient
dilution of reactants before combustion takes place, leading to low reaction rates. The
decreased reaction rates bring about a low heat release rate per volume, which is the
reason for more uniform temperature distribution.

The Favre-averaged mass fractions (YOH,
YCH2O, and YCO) of
the species OH, CH2O, and CO are shown in Figure 13. Evidently, high values of YOH,
YCH2O, and YCO are
more concentrated in the BB case. Moreover, the maximum values for
YOH and YCO in the BB case are
about 40 times larger than those for the NBB case. As discussed above, those intermediate
species are produced and destroyed at low rates for the MC due to the dilution effect and
slow ignition process, while, for the CC, chemical reactions take place violently behind
the BB, leading to more intermediate species per unit volume.

Figure 13 Contour distributions of Favre-averaged mass fractions of OH, CH2O, and CO
in the (a) NBB and (b) BB cases. The reaction zone is bounded with the contour (black
line) of YCO/YCOmax = 5%.

Comparison of Figures 5 and 14
suggests that the high OH and high-temperature regions are overlapped. That is, the
generation of OH is strongly correlated with high temperature. The generation and
consumption of OH are mainly controlled by these reactions: (I) H + O2 →
OH + O and (II) CO + OH → CO2 + H. Moreover, reaction I has a high
activation energy (60.2 kJ/mol) and therefore requires a high temperature to ensue.
Besides, the distributions of CH2O and OH are almost in a complementary
relationship, signifying that the two species hardly coexist, whatever the mode of
combustion is. For consumption of CH2O, the most important reaction is
CH2O + OH → CHO + H2O, whose activation energy is very low
(about 1.9 kJ/mol) or the reaction temperature is low. In the MC, because of the low
temperature rise, the maximum OH value is reduced largely, and especially CH2O
is distributed widely, versus a highly concentrated CH2O region in the CC.
These differences characterize the two combustion modes, as demonstrated in Figure 14. This figure shows the contours of the
species mass fractions of 5% of their maxima (i.e.,
Y/Ymax ≥ 5%), which represent the
regions of significant intermediate species CH3, CH2O, CHO, CO, OH,
and CH4.

Figure 14 Comparisons of different regions of main species CH4, CH3,
CH2O, CHO, CO, and OH in the (a) NBB and (b) BB cases.

Distinct distributions of CH4 and the other five intermediate species are
obvious for the NBB and BB cases. The regions of
Y/Ymax ≥ 5% of the intermediate
species (CH3, CH2O, CHO, and CO) for the MC are much larger than
those for the CC. This means that the oxidation of MC is much slower than that of CC.
Because of a strong dilution of the hot coflow, various reactions for MC are greatly
restrained, causing both low reaction rates and a large reaction zone simultaneously.
Although the length of the reaction zone (the same definition as above) of the MC is about
2 times greater than that of the CC, the former is much larger than the latter in volume
by 10–20 times. Note that, in the CC, only CO and OH distribute over significant
downstream distances. That is, the related reactions of OH and CO are slower or occur
later than those of other species shown in Figure 14. In fact, the reaction CO + OH → CO2 + H is one of the
latest reactions for CH4 oxidation.1 Besides, this reaction
is the most important one to determine the oxidation rate of CC. However, in the MC, all
intermediate carbon-related species appear to distribute similarly or not much
differently; see Figure 14. That is, the
reactions associated with those species are all important for the oxidation of MC.
Moreover, in the MC, the distribution regions of CO and OH are much different and
especially the OH-related reactions seem to continue even at the end of the computational
domain (200d).

5 Concluding Remarks
This study has been carried out to address the lack of comparison, in the literature,
between the MILD combustion (MC) and typical conventional combustion (CC) of the bluff-body
(BB) flame of a premixed CH4/air jet in a hot coflow (simulating the furnace gas)
under identical inlet and ambient conditions. This work is distinct from the previous work,
comparing the establishment conditions and reaction characteristics of MC and CC through
differing inlet and ambient conditions, i.e., nozzle size and ejection angle, inlet
temperature and velocity, fuel type, fuel/oxidant diluting type and dilution level, coflow
oxygen level and temperature, etc. In this study, a BB is placed near the nozzle exit as a
flame stabilizer to differentiate MC and CC of a practical BB flame. The MC and CC have been
characterized in terms of their flow fields, combustion establishments, mean temperatures,
and species concentrations in Section 4,
from which the main conclusions can be drawn below:(1) The MC and CC modes are fundamentally distinct. In
the CC case, the conventional flame is established and stabilized by a steady heat
source of the recirculation zone (RZ) behind the BB with highly intense mixing and
rapid burning. By contrast, the MC is a slow combustion mode that develops (and
sustains) by entraining and mixing the hot “flue gas” so as to heat the
premixed reactant mixture gradually beyond the autoignition temperature
(Tai). In other words, relative to the CC, the MC
depresses nearly all combustion-related chemical reactions and thus reduces local
burning peak temperatures and mass fractions of main intermediate species. As a
consequence, a large reaction zone with uniform temperature distribution (i.e., low
temperature rise) is found in the MC mode, while the CC has a much smaller reaction
zone with concentrated high temperature and species
distributions.

(2) Under the same inlet and
boundary conditions, MC and CC may be switched only by changing the inner flow
structure through a BB. This proves that the BB has a great impact on changing the
combustion mode without varying the ambient oxygen level and temperature or
others.

(3) In the CC case, a secondary
combustion zone is formed far downstream under the ambient condition of
high-temperature (above autoignition) hot coflow. This observation has never been
reported in the literature before and therefore is a new finding. With this finding,
it is postulated that the use of a BB nozzle can also produce the MC mode. In other
words, the BB nozzle may achieve both combustion modes by varying the premixed
reactant momentum. This interesting issue will be left for another study in the near
future.
