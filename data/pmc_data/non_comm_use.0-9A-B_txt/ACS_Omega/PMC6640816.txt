Vanadium
dioxide (VO2), with reversible metal–semiconductor
transition near room temperature, is a compelling candidate for thermochromic
windows. Nanocomposite
coatings derived from VO2 nanoparticles are particularly
superior to VO2 films due to their advantages in large-scale
preparation, flexible shaping, and regulation of optical properties.
In this work, we developed a novel method for one-step hydrothermal
synthesis of W-doped VO2 (M) nanorods and studied their
application in large-scale infrared smart windows. On introducing
tartaric acid as a new reductant, VO2 underwent a two-stage
phase evolution from the pure phase comprising VO2 (A)
nanobelts to VO2 (M) nanorods, instead of the conventional
three-stage B–A–M phase evolution during hydrothermal
synthesis. This transition is very favorable for the large-scale hydrothermal
synthesis of VO2 (M). The phase-transition temperature
of VO2 (M) nanoparticles can be regulated systematically
by W doping, with a reduction efficiency of about 24.52 °C/atom
% W. Moreover, VO2 (M) composite films were fabricated
using a convenient roller coating method, which exhibited significant
midinfrared transmission switching up to 31%, with a phase-transition
temperature of about 37.3 °C. This work demonstrates the significant
progress in the one-step hydrothermal synthesis of VO2 (M)
nanorods and provides significant insights into their applications
in infrared smart windows.

1 Introduction
Vanadium dioxide (VO2) is an excellent tunable functional
material with complex polymorphs. Until now, more than 10 kinds of
crystalline phases of VO2 (phases B, M, R, A, C, and so
on) have been reported.1 However, among
all of these polymorphs, VO2 (M) is the most meaningful
one because only VO2 (M) undergoes a fully reversible first-order
metal–semiconductor transition (MST) near room temperature
(RT) (Tc = 68 °C).2 This transition is accompanied by dramatic changes in the
electrical and optical properties from a low-temperature monoclinic
semiconductor phase (M phase) to a high-temperature tetragonal rutile
metallic phase (R-phase).3 Meanwhile, the Tc of VO2 (M) can be regulated by
doping or stress.4 As a consequence, VO2 (M) has been attracting increasing attention for its potential
applications in infrared smart windows, switches, sensors, data storage
devices, field-effect transitions, and so forth.5−9 Because of these attractive properties and applications,
various kinds of approaches were explored to fabricate VO2 (M). However, it should be noted that most of the reported methods
are focused on the preparation of VO2 films. By contrast,
VO2 (M) nanoparticles can significantly lessen the stress
for phase transformation, satisfy the need for a large area, flexible
and special shape substrates coating by adding appropriate organics,
and improve both ΔTlum and ΔTsol by dispersing in a dielectric host.10 Therefore, seeking a suitable method to prepare
VO2 (M) nanoparticles is highly desired and urgently needed.

Nowadays, several approaches have been developed for preparing
VO2 (M) nanoparticles, such as pyrolysis of vanadium-containing
precursors, microemulsion-based methods, the solution combustion process,
the vapor transport approach, hydrothermal synthesis, and so forth.11−16 Among all of the above methods, the hydrothermal synthetic process
is the most commonly used method to synthesize VO2 (M)
nanoparticles due to its simple route of synthesis, low cost, lower
required temperature, and comparatively environmentally friendly reaction
conditions. Normally, the metastable phase, VO2 (B), acts
as the final product in the hydrothermal reaction, which can then
be transformed to VO2 (M) by the postheating treatment.7,15,16 However, postheating annealing
might lead to serious aggregation; thus, the corresponding thermochromic
properties were seriously deteriorated. Encouragingly, there have
been several reports on synthesizing VO2 (M) through a
one-step hydrothermal reaction. For instance, Son et al. synthesized
asterisk-shaped VO2 (M) nanocrystals using VOSO4, hydrazine, and NaOH, but the secondary phase, VO2 (B),
always exists.17 Cao et al. fabricated
W-doped VO2 (R) snowflakes by hydrothermal treatment with
V2O5 and oxalic acid at 240 °C over a reaction
time of 7 days.1 Hollow microspheres of
VO2 (M) were also obtained by the reaction of V2O5, PVP, and oxalic acid at 300 °C for 6 h.18 It is obvious that the high temperature and
long reaction time will result in energy consumption. Furthermore,
some researchers have confirmed that introducing doping additives,
such as W, Mo, Sb atoms, would promote the generation of pure phase
of VO2 (M) through the hydrothermal reduction of V2O5 by oxalic acid.1,19−21 Unfortunately, as far as we know, the synthesized pure VO2 (M) particles easily develop a snowflake morphology and the amount
of product formed is always small, which limits their dispersion and
transparency and makes them unsuitable for large-scale production.19 Recently, Li et al. fabricated
asterisk-shaped Mo-doped VO2 (M), with a Mo doping concentration
higher than 5.62 atom % and a change in the infrared transmittance
of Mo-doped VO2 (M) of only about 10%.20 Chen et al. reported a one-step hydrothermal method for
the growth of VO2 (M/R) nanorods, using V2O5, oxalic acid, and ammonium tungstate as raw materials. They
indicated that the W dopant was a crucial parameter for the shape-controlled
hydrothermal synthesis of VO2 (M/R), but it was noted that
most of the products were still in the shape of a snowflake at a low
doping concentration.21

Another metastable
polymorph, VO2 (A), was reported
as an intermediate phase during the transformation from VO2 (B) to VO2 (M) by Théobald.22 This polymorph also exhibited a similar reversible phase-transition
property from low-temperature tetragonal VO2 (A) to high-temperature
body-centered tetragonal VO2 (AH) at 162 °C.23 VO2 (A) is a thermodynamically stable
phase compared with VO2 (B), which may be beneficial in
the generation of VO2 (M). However, this metastable phase
has not been studied widely until now because the growth conditions
of VO2 (A) are so harsh that this metastable phase is usually
missed during the preparation of the VO2 polymorph.24−27

In this study, we introduced a new reductant, tartaric acid
(TA),
instead of the conventional reductant, oxalic acid, in the hydrothermal
synthesis of VO2 nanoparticles. TA is a typical α-hydroxycarboxylic
acid, which has been successfully applied to the hydrothermal synthesis
of TiO2, Fe3O4, In2O3, Sb2S3, WO3, Bi2S3, and so forth.28−33 The hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in TA endow it with suitable hydrophilic
characteristics and can promote the reduction of vanadium oxides and
formation of VO2 eventually during the hydrothermal process
in the present system. In our study, we developed a novel one-step
TA-assisted hydrothermal synthesis method to prepare VO2 (A) nanobelts and then transformed them to VO2 (M) nanorods
through W doping. It was inspiring to discover that the VO2 (M) nanoparticles possessed high purity, good crystallinity, and
a stable morphology, and the Tc of VO2 (M) could be simply tuned to a comfortable
temperature by adjusting the doping concentrations of ammonium tungstate.
Composite films
obtained by mixing these nanoparticles with a polymer matrix and then
roller coating this mixture onto a polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
substrate exhibited significant midinfrared transmission switching
properties and demonstrated great application potential in infrared
smart windows.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-prepared products with
different amounts of TA in the absence of ammonium tungstate. For
V2O5/TA molar
ratios of 20:1 and 10:1, the products are mixtures of V2O5 and V3O7·H2O,
V3O7·H2O, and VO2 (A), respectively. As the molar ratio increases to 5:1, all of the
diffraction peaks match well with the standard XRD pattern of the
metastable VO2 (A) (JCPDS no. 42-0876, space group P42/ncm, a = b = 8.450 Å, c = 7.678 Å). The
absence of any other phase or impurities illustrates that the as-obtained
VO2 (A) has a high purity. Upon further increasing the
amount of TA, V2O5 is further reduced to V5O9. This indicates that there is a reduction process:
V2O5 → V3O7·H2O → VO2 (A) → V5O9 → V2O3, with TA as the reducing
reagent during this reaction. According to the above results, a V2O5/TA molar ratio of 5:1 is optimal for the synthesis
of pure-phase VO2 (A). The morphology of pure-phase VO2 (A) was studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (inset of Figure 1d). Obviously, it can be seen
from Figure 1c,d that
the product exhibits a clear beltlike morphology, with a width of
200–300 nm and a length of up to several tens of micrometers.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis of the VO2 (A) nanobelts clearly shows a noticeable endothermic peak at 169
°C, as shown in Figure 1b, which can be assigned to the phase transition of low-temperature
tetragonal VO2 (A) to high-temperature body-centered tetragonal
VO2 (AH).23

V2O5/TA molar ratios; (b) DSC curve of VO2 (A); (c, d) SEM images of VO2 (A) at low and high
magnifications, respectively; the inset is the TEM image.

Generally, hydrothermal reduction of V2O5 to VO2 follows the following phase evolution:
VO2 (B) → VO2 (A) → VO2 (M/R).22,34 The formation energy of the VO2 (A) phase has been demonstrated
to be higher than that of VO2 (B).34,35 This indicates that VO2 (A) is a more thermodynamically
stable phase compared with metastable VO2 (B). In this
regard, VO2 (A) is more beneficial for the generation of
VO2 (M) than VO2 (B) during hydrothermal synthesis.
To analyze the relative stabilities of VO2 (B) and VO2 (A) more visually, the crystal structures of VO2 (B) and VO2 (A) were compared. As displayed in Figure 2, both of them are
layered structures and are composed of VO6 octahedra basic units.
In the structure of VO2 (B), vanadium atoms are no longer
in the center of the VO6 octahedra, causing the VO6 octahedra to get
slightly distorted. For VO2 (A), the VO6 octahedra are
less deformed.36 In addition, the V–O–V
bond angle in the structure of VO2 (B) is nearly vertical,
which leads to the generation of intense structural tension and electronic
repulsion. By contrast, the structure
of VO2 (A) shows less electronic repulsion, thus reducing
the structural tension.34 Overall, it can
be indicated that VO2 (A) has a more thermodynamically
stable structure than VO2 (B). In this work, TA was employed
to be the reductant instead of the conventionally used oxalic acid,
and VO2 (A) but not VO2 (B) was formed indirectly.21 So, the VO2 (B) → VO2 (A) → VO2 (M/R) phase evolution could be avoided,
which is very favorable for the transformation into VO2 (M). This change would realize large-scale hydrothermal synthesis
of pure-phase VO2 (M). In our experiments,
0.996 g of VO2 (M) was obtained using a 100 mL Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave, with the introduction of TA as the reducing
agent. By contrast, the yields of VO2 (M) from the other
groups are much smaller. For example, Chen et al., Shen et al., and
Dai et al. fabricated 0.114 g of VO2 (M) using a 50 mL
Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave.37−40 So, we state that the yield of
VO2 (M) was 4 times higher than that obtained by the other
research groups.

(a) and VO2 (A) (b). The red and gray balls represent vanadium
and oxygen atoms, respectively.

It has been reported that introducing doping additives could
promote
the generation of VO2 (M). In this work, we choose ammonium
tungstate to support the synthesis of VO2 (M). Figure 3a shows the XRD patterns
of W-doped VO2 nanoparticles, with a doping content from
0.5 to 2 atom %. It is worth noting that W doping has a significant
influence on the preparation of pure-phase VO2 (M). For
the sample with the addition of 0.5 and 1 atom % W, the product is
a mixture of VO2 (A) and the main phase, monoclinic VO2 (M) (JCPDS no. 43-1051, space group P21/c, a = 5.752 Å, b = 4.538 Å, c = 5.383 Å). On increasing the amount of W to 1.5
atom %, the diffraction peaks of VO2 (A) vanish and all
peaks can be indexed to VO2 (M), illustrating that pure-phase
VO2 (M) (Tc ∼ RT) is
successfully synthesized. However, Cao et al. reported that pure-phase
W-doped VO2 (M) could only be obtained when the reaction
time reached 7 days and the W-doping content was 4 atom %.1 Upon continuously increasing the W-doping content
to 2 atom %, pure-phase VO2 (R) (JCPDS no. 76-0675, space
group P42/mnm, a = 4.556 Å, b = 4.556 Å, c = 2.860 Å) is obtained at RT (Tc ⩽ RT). No peaks of any other phase are observed, revealing
that the products are well crystallized, with high purities. In addition,
there are no peaks related to ammonium tungstate or its derivatives,
suggesting that the W atoms are incorporated into the crystal lattice
of VO2 (M), forming a substitutional solid solution. Magnifications
of the (011) peak for VO2 (M) and (110) peak for VO2 (R) are displayed in Figure 3b. Significant shifting of the M (011) peaks to smaller
angles is detected, which indicates a slight increase in the interplanar
spacing. This can be attributed to the substitution of V atoms with
W atoms of a larger atomic radius. Moreover, more V atoms would be
substituted on increasing the W-doping content. This result could
further confirm that W was successfully captured into the crystal
lattice of VO2 (M). In addition, it could be concluded
that W doping can promote the transformation from VO2 (A)
to VO2 (M). As we know, VO2 (M) is more thermodynamically
stable than VO2 (A), which makes the synthesis of VO2 (M) require more energy. On doping with W,
the VO6 octahedron is distorted by the partial substitution of V atoms
with W atoms, which makes the interconnections between different VO6
octahedra break more easily, as the atomic radius of W atoms is larger
than that of V atoms. This mechanism offers not only oxygen vacancies
but also the energy required for the formation of pure-phase VO2 (M). Therefore, VO2 (A) transforms to VO2 (M) completely when the W-doping content reaches a certain value.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was performed to investigate
the composition and chemical state of the W-doped VO2 sample. Figure 4a shows a wide-range
survey spectrum of 2 atom % W-doped VO2 (M). It reveals
that the sample
consists of vanadium, oxygen, carbon, and tungsten, where the peak
of carbon is attributed to the hydrocarbon contamination on the sample
surface. In Figure 4b, the O1s and V2p peaks were fitted with a Shirley function. The
peak located at 530.3 eV can be assigned to O2– in
V–O, which is in good accordance with the structural information
on the VO2 (M) structure.41 Additionally,
the V2p3/2 peak is separated into two peaks, meaning two
valence states of vanadium (+4 valence and +5 valence) exist in the
sample. The binding energy of 516.5 eV corresponds to V4+, which is slightly higher than 515.8 eV for pure VO2 but
is consistent with the value for W-doped VO2 (M) obtained
in previous reports, suggesting that the binding energy of the +4
valence state of V2p3/2 increases slightly after W-dopant
introduction.42,43 In addition, the binding energy
of 517.7 eV is assigned to V5+ due to oxidation at the
surface of the sample when exposed to air. The difference between
the binding energies of O1s and V2p3/2 is 13.8 eV, consistent
with the value of 14.2 eV reported in the literature.44Figure 4c shows binding energies of 35.22 and 37.38 eV for W 4f7/2 and W 4f5/2, respectively, revealing that the existing
form of W ions in this sample is W6+ instead of the other
valence form.45 This result confirmed that
the W atom was actually doped into the VO2 nanoparticles.

for W 4f.

Typical SEM and TEM images of
VO2 powders with different
W-doping contents are presented in Figure 5. Both beltlike and rodlike morphologies
are observed for 0.5 atom % doping in this work (Figure 5a). With 1 atom % doping (Figure 5b), the nanorod particles
in the sample increase obviously. For the sample with 1.5 atom % W
doping (Figure 5c),
the former belt crystals disappear and all of the particles show a
rodlike shape, with a typical width of 100–200 nm and an uneven
length. Subsequently, as the W-doping content is increased to 2 atom
% (Figure 5d and its
inset), the powders exhibit uniform nanorods and the length increases
up to several micrometers. The aspect ratio of the nanorods increases
noticeably. This result suggests that increasing the W-doping content
could promote not only the generation of VO2 (M) but also
the growth of nanorods.

atom %; the inset is the TEM image.

As far as we know,
VO2 (M) particles synthesized by a one-step hydrothermal
reaction with oxalic acid as a reductant always show a snowflake shape.1,19,21 By contrast, one-dimensional
(1D) nanostructures, such as nanorods, nanobelts, and nanowires, have
raised great interest because they present novel characteristics,
owing to their small radial dimensions, while retaining their longitudinal
connectivity. As a kind of 1D nanostructure,
nanorods can be used for investigating specialized applications and
in fundamental research, such as assessment of the phase-transition
temperature and phase-transition mechanism of VO2 (M).46 Normally, W-doped VO2 (M) nanorods
were fabricated through a two-step hydrothermal method. There are
a few studies on the preparation of W-doped VO2 (M) nanorods
via a one-step hydrothermal method.21,47,48 For instance, Chen et al. reported that W doping
plays a crucial role in the growth of W-doped VO2 (M) nanorods.21 In our study, TA is not only a reductant but
also a kind of alternative template reagent. The presence of TA was
crucial in obtaining nanorods, owing to the capping effect.33,49 A probable mechanism for the evolution of nanorods is presented
in Figure 6. The VO2 grains grow, with the reaction proceeding continuously. Simultaneously,
TA may play a certain role as a capping agent, which is adsorbed onto
the surface of VO2 and controls the overall growth kinetics.
The lateral growth of VO2 is restricted due to hindrance
of the capping agent. These result
in the growth of the products only to specific facets and in obtaining
nanorods eventually.

Figure 6 Schematic illustration of the effect of TA on the morphology
evolution
of VO2 nanorods.

Figure 7 shows
the
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of the as-synthesized VO2 powders. The characteristic broad absorption
bands that appeared in all samples at 3436 and 1631 cm–1 are assigned to the stretching and bending vibrations of the hydroxyl
group (−OH), respectively, resulting from the absorbed H2O molecules on the surface of VO2. The absorption
band at 2380 cm–1 is due to the asymmetric stretching
vibrations of CO2. In particular, we can clearly
see differences among the three phases of VO2, with a range
of 400–1000 cm–1, which can be ascribed to
the different vibration modes of the V–O type. For VO2 (A), the band at 941
cm–1 is assigned to the stretching of short V=O
bands and the two peaks at 594 and 557 cm–1 are
attributed to the delocalization of the electrons involved in V4+–V4+ bonds between VO6 octahedra, which
are characteristic of VO2(A).24,33 In the typical FTIR spectrum of a monoclinic VO2 (M)
sample, the absorption band at 530 cm–1 could be
attributed to the bending vibrations of V–O–V bridges
and the broad band at 684 cm–1 is characteristic
of the first “rutile packing” of VO6 octahedra.26 Additionally, there is no vibrational absorption
peak corresponding to rutile VO2 (R). For VO2 (M), the electrons involved in the V–V bonds between VO6
octahedra are localized. However, these electrons are delocalized
for VO2 (R); this delocalization involves a screening effect
for the incident photons.50,51 Under this circumstance,
no vibration absorption band for VO2 (R) can be observed,
which implies a drastic decrease in the transmittance. Therefore,
FTIR can be used as a characterization method to distinguish the three
phases of vanadium dioxide.

Figure 7 FTIR spectra of the prepared VO2 powders
with different
W-doping contents.

The Tc’s of VO2 nanoparticles
with different doping contents were characterized by DSC, as shown
in Figure 8a. It can
be seen that the Tc of VO2 (M)
decreases with an increase in the W-doping content. An increase in
the W content from 0.5 to 2 atom % significantly reduces Tc from 60.6 to 21.3 °C, which is lower than RT, providing
auxiliary evidence for the formation of pure-phase VO2 (R)
at RT with 2 atom % W doping. Moreover, the intensity of the DSC peaks
decreases with an increase in the W-doping content. The explanation
could be as follows: The low-temperature monoclinic structure of VO2 (M) demonstrates alternative V–V intervals (2.65 and
3.12 Å), whereas the high-temperature rutile structure of VO2 (R) has a very symmetric structure, with equidistant V–V
intervals (2.87 Å).4 Partial substitution
of the V atoms with large W atoms causes the V–V interval to
shrink, leading to a decrease in the structural differences between
VO2 (M) and VO2 (R) and reducing the MST activation
energy accordingly.20Figure 8b shows the linear relationship
between Tc and W concentration (from 0.5
to 2 atom %). The least-squares approximation gives a Tc reduction efficiency of 24.52 °C/atom %, which
is slightly higher than that obtained by other research groups that
synthesized VO2 (M) by a one-step hydrothermal method but
is consistent with that previously reported, revealing that the Tc of VO2 (M) could be easily tuned
by adjusting the W-doping content.43,47,48,52−56 These results suggest effective W doping in VO2 and also
further confirm the formation of VO2 (M), which is in accordance
with the XRD results.

with linear fitting of the
obtained
VO2 powders with different W-doping contents.

The 1.5 atom % W-doped VO2 (M) nanorods
were mixed with
a polymer matrix and then processed to form a composite film on the
PET substrate using a convenient roller coating method, as shown in Figure 9. The film is highly
transparent, flexible, homogeneous, smooth, and light gray-blue in
color. Although the infrared spectrum extends across a wide range
(0.77–1000 μm), there are only two wavelength ranges
that show high infrared transmittance in the atmosphere (3–5
and 8–12 μm).57 So, we study
the phase-transition properties of VO2 films in the infrared
region. The optical properties of the VO2 composite film
were investigated from variable-temperature infrared spectra (Figure 10). Figure 10a represents the infrared
transmittance of the VO2 composite film during the heating
process. It can be seen that the transmittance decreases significantly
with an increase in temperature, corresponding to the semiconductor–metal
phase transition of VO2. Figure 10b displays the hysteresis
loop of the normalized transmittance–temperature plot at a
fixed wavelength of 9 μm. A significant change in the transmittance
up to 31% across the phase transition is observed, suggesting that
1D W-doped VO2 (M) has a good infrared-switching property.
The corresponding first-order derivative curves are shown in the inset
of Figure 10b. It
is worth noting that the phase-transition temperatures of the heating
transition and cooling transition are 45.2 °C (T1) and 29.4 °C (T2),
respectively. According to the calculated results, the Tc of the film is 37.3 °C (Tc = (T1 + T2)/2); this result is in agreement with that of the DSC analysis
shown in Figure 8,
and the hysteresis width (ΔT) of the film is
15.8 °C (ΔT = T1 – T2).

VO2 (M).

I, 3.5–5.5 μm; (d) window II, 8.5–12.5 μm;
and (e) window III, 14.5–25 μm.

Figure 10c–e
shows that
the VO2 composite film displays three switching windows
in the middle-infrared region: window I, 3.5–5.5 μm;
window II, 8.5–12.5 μm; and window III, 14.5–25
μm. This means that the VO2 hybrid film can achieve
middle-infrared switching in multiple regions, and the switching region
could be regulated by choosing different polymer matrixes. It is worth
noting that
infrared switching of the composite film at around 37.3 °C is
useful for limiting the infrared thermal radiation and thus can be
used to regulate RT. Moreover, the employed roller coating method
is useful for large-scale fabrication of VO2 composite
films. So, we believe that the present work is significant for the
practical application of VO2 (M) in infrared smart windows.

3 Experimental Section
3.1 Synthesis of W-Doped VO2 (M)
A certain amount of TA (C4H6O6; purchased from Pangang Group Steel Vanadium &
Titanium Co.,
Ltd.) was dissolved in 80 mL of deionized water. Then, 1.092 g of
vanadium pentoxide and the requisite quantity of ammonium tungstate
were added to the solution, with constant magnetic stirring for 1
h. Thereafter, the mixture was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined
stainless steel autoclave, sealed, maintained at 240 °C for 48
h, and cooled to RT naturally. The resulting black precipitate was
collected by centrifugation and washed two times with deionized water
and ethanol, respectively, before drying in a thermostatic drying
oven at 60 °C for 12 h.

3.2 Fabrication of VO2 (M) Composite
Films
As-prepared W-doped VO2 (M) (5 wt %) was
dispersed in tetraethyl orthosilicate with continuous stirring. Then,
2 wt % silane coupling agent and 2 wt % dispersant were added, with
constant magnetic stirring for 10 min. Thereafter, an appropriate
quantity of poly(ethyl methacrylate) was added gradually into the
above solution, which was stirred for another 10 min. Finally, the
slurry was uniformly cast onto a PET substrate using a stainless steel
coating bar and dried at 80 °C for 1 min.

3.3 Characterization
The crystalline
structures of the products were determined by DX2000 X-ray powder
diffraction with Cu Kα1, 2 radiation (λ = 0.154056 nm).
The morphologies of products were investigated by SEM (S-4800; Hitachi)
and TEM (Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN; FEI), with an accelerating voltage
of 200 kV. The vanadium valence states and chemical composition of
W-doped VO2 were detected by XPS (Kratos, England) using
an Al Kα (hν = 1486.6 eV) exciting source.
The FTIR spectrum from 400–4000 cm–1 was
measured on a Tensor 27 (Bruker, Germany) spectrometer, using pressed
KBr tablets. The phase-transition behavior of the products was analyzed
by DSC (DSC1; Mettler toledo) in the temperature range from 0 to 100
or 200 °C, at a heating rate of 10 °C/min using a liquid-nitrogen
cooling unit. The optical properties of the films
were also investigated by FTIR attached an adapted heating controlled
unit, and then the hysteresis loops of W-doped VO2 film
was received by collecting the transmittance of films at a fixed wavelength
(9 μm).

4 Conclusions
In summary,
the A, M,
and R controlled phases of VO2 were prepared for the first
time by the one-step hydrothermal synthesis method. TA was used as
a new reductant, and W doping was performed to facilitate the formation
of VO2 (M) and regulate its phase-transition temperature.
The VO2 underwent a two-stage phase evolution from pure-phase
VO2 (A) nanobelts to VO2 (M) nanorods, instead
of the conventional three-stage B–A–M phase evolution.
Furthermore, the Tc’s of the VO2 (M) nanorods were regulated systematically, with a reduction
efficiency of about 24.52 °C/atom % W. A flexible W-doped VO2 (M) composite film on PET was fabricated using the convenient
roller coating method. This composite film exhibited significant middle-infrared
transmission switching of up to 31%, with a phase-transition temperature
of about 37.3 °C. Moreover, the VO2 composite film
can achieve middle-infrared switching in multiple regions. In this
work, we developed a one-step hydrothermal method for the synthesis
of VO2 (M) nanorods and provided significant insights into
their applications in large-scale infrared smart windows.
