The simple and reversible control of the degree of polymerization,
and thereby the bulk material properties, of a supramolecular polymer
is reported. Noncovalent capping agents (chain stoppers) modulate
the length of supramolecular polymers by stacking on the surfaces
of the polymer’s ends. Methylene blue (MB) is
a positively charged, planar polycyclic dye that acts as a chain stopper.
It can be reversibly switched between its colored, planar, cationic
state and a colorless, nonplanar, neutral state (leucomethylene blue, LMB) by reduction with ascorbic acid and then reoxidized to MB by O2. LMB does not act as a chain
stopper. This behavior was utilized to reversibly trigger the gel
to sol transformation of supramolecular polymers formed by the self-assembly
of hexameric rosettes comprising 2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine and a hexanoic
acid-substituted cyanuric acid (CyCo6) in aqueous media.
The results of our experiments highlight the ability of this approach
to reversibly switch between the gel and solution states of materials
formed from supramolecular polymers and thereby control their bulk
properties.

Introduction
Supramolecular polymers are highly responsive
to environmental
stimuli as a result of reversible—and dynamic—noncovalent
interactions between their monomers.1−5 Materials formed from supramolecular polymers, in particular hydrogels,
that can be switched between their solution and gel phases are of
interest for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and cellular
growth scaffolding.6−9 A number of controlling factors have been exploited to modulate
the structure and assembly of supramolecular polymers including changes
in temperature, pH, ion binding, and the presence of enzymes.10−17,36 Practical applications of these
switchable materials typically require specially designed and chemically
complex monomers that, for example, incorporate ligand-binding sites.6,11,14,18 We report herein that the gels formed by supramolecular polymers
in aqueous solution from 2,4,6-triaminopyridine (TAP)
and a hexanoic acid-substituted cyanuric acid (CyCo6)
(Figure 1A) can be
easily and reversibly switched by coupling with redox reactions of
methylene blue (MB).

of theory; omega was kept at the default value of 0.2. All calculations
were performed in the Gaussian09.D01 package.

TAP and CyCo6 assemble
to form hydrogen-bonded
hexad structures (rosettes) that stack into linear, noncovalent hydrogel-forming
supramolecular polymers (Figure 1A).10,19,20 We previously reported that positively charged planar heterocyclic
molecules can act as noncovalent chain stoppers. These molecules can
be used to control the length of TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular
polymers and thus the bulk properties of their hydrogels.21 The chain stoppers previously examined could
not be reversibly switched by external chemical or physical means.22−25

It is well known that MB exists in two stable
oxidation
states: a colored, planar cationic dye (MB) and a colorless,
electrically neutral, bent structure, leucomethylene blue (LMB)26−28 (Figure 1B). The
reversible reduction of MB has previously been used to
switch stimuli responsive materials.29,30 This application
takes advantage of the relatively slow reduction of MB to LMB by organic reductants and its much faster reversal
by O2.31 We utilized a large
excess of ascorbic acid (AA) to reduce MB to LMB.26 This reaction
is readily reversed by exposure of LMB solutions to air
as O2 rapidly oxidizes LMB to MB and in the absence of a metal catalyst, the oxidation of AA by O2 proceeds at an immeasurably slow rate.32

Results and Discussion
Noncovalent Chain Termination Using MB
At concentrations
above 15 mM, the minimum assembly concentration (MAC), in 200 mM phosphate
buffer solution, equimolar mixtures of TAP and CyCo6 form gels of very long supramolecular polymers (>10
μm). Detailed analyses of the stability of TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular hydrogels and the role of various chain stopper molecules
in controlling the length and viscoelastic properties of these hydrogels
were previously reported.10,21 The effect of MB on these TAP–CyCo6 gels (30 mM TAP–CyCo6) was investigated by the vial inversion test,
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy
(AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques. The vial inversion
test is a simple way to observe sol–gel transitions. A gel
does not flow when the vial containing it is inverted, whereas a solution
does. Addition of MB to gelled solutions of TAP–CyCo6 results in gradual loss of elastic strength and fluidizing of the
system as the concentration of MB is increased to ca.
1 mM (Figure 2A). AFM
imaging was used to confirm the chain termination of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies with MB. In the absence of MB, AFM images reveal micron length linear fibers of TAP–CyCo6 with heights of approximately 2 nm (Figure 2B). The addition of MB results
in a concentration-dependent reduction of the length of these supramolecular
polymers (Figure 2C).

the bulk viscoelastic properties of a solution of 30 mM TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular assemblies. (B,C) AFM images
of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies without and with 0.25
mM MB, respectively. All samples were prepared in 200
mM phosphate buffer at pH 7.

1H NMR spectroscopy was used to determine
the MAC of
the TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular assemblies in the
absence and presence of MB. The 1H NMR resonances
of unassembled monomers are present in the spectra, but monomers incorporated
into the supramolecular polymers are “invisible” because
their slow tumbling results in their resonances being broadened to
baseline.20,21,331H NMR measurements of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies in
the absence and presence of MB indicate that the MAC
(15 mM for each TAP and CyCo6 monomers at
20 °C in this case) is unchanged by the addition of MB (Figure S1, Supporting Information).
This shows that the number of assembled TAP and CyCo6 monomers is not affected by the presence of MB, indicating that MB shortens the length of TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular polymers without affecting the total number of assembled
monomers.

DLS reveals the effect of MB on the dynamic
viscosity
of TAP–CyCo6 polymers. The square electric field
autocorrelation was measured at 20 °C as a function of the correlation
time for solutions containing 20 mM TAP–CyCo6 at
various concentrations of MB. At MB concentrations
up to 0.25 mM, the autocorrelation function was found to change from
a clear two-step function that indicates two well-defined dynamic
time scales to a single-step function and faster decay (Figure 3). These results show that
the supramolecular polymers are shortened by addition of MB in a concentration dependent manner and suggest that MB binds to and reduces the length of TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular polymers in accord with the mechanism that was previously
reported for noncovalent chain stoppers.21

concentrations of MB (0–0.25 mM).

The interaction of MB with TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular polymers was investigated by absorption spectroscopy. Figure 4A shows the absorption
spectra of 0.25 mM of MB in buffer solution and in a
solution containing 30 mM TAP–CyCo6 (15 mM free
monomers). The absorption spectrum of MB in phosphate
buffer (distinct peaks at 606, 662 nm) and in the presence of TAP–CyCo6 assembly (peaks at 619, 650 nm) differ and
neither corresponds to its spectrum in methanol (Figure S2, Supporting Information), which shows a single
peak at 654 nm corresponding to monomeric MB. MB is known to aggregate in aqueous solution, which accounts for the
observed changes in the absorption spectra.34 When the concentration of MB in the phosphate buffer
is increased from 0.062 to 3.75 mM (Figure 4B), the amount of absorption attributed to
aggregates with respect to the monomer increases gradually and then
reaches a plateau at ca. 1 mM (Figure 4D). Significantly, the absorption spectrum of MB in the presence of TAP–CyCo6 shows
only negligible changes in the relative intensity of aggregates to
the monomer as the MB concentration is increased (Figure 4C,D), which is consistent
with the proposed dynamic equilibrium between MB-capped TAP–CyCo6 rosettes and free monomeric TAP and CyCo6 in solution. Increasing the concentration
of MB in the presence of TAP–CyCo6 leads to the formation of a greater number of shorter fibers as
a result of MB binding to the surface of TAP–CyCo6 rosettes and thus competing with the self-aggregation of MB.

of MB monomers by TAP–CyCo6 assembly.
All solutions are buffered with phosphate at pH 7.

The inhibition of MB aggregation by TAP–CyCo6 was confirmed by temperature-dependent absorption
studies. The absorption
spectrum of a 0.25 mM solution of MB in 200 mM phosphate
buffer shows an increase in the monomer peak at 650 nm as the temperature
is increased (Figure 5A). In contrast, increasing the temperature of a sample containing
0.25 mM of MB and 30 mM of TAP–CyCo6 results in no change to the MB spectrum up to 25 °C.
Above 25 °C, the MB absorption band at 650 nm corresponding
to the monomer begins to increase with an accompanying bathochromic
shift to 666 nm. The monomer band continues to grow in intensity up
to 35 °C, beyond which there is no change in the spectrum (Figure 5B). The relative
changes in intensity of the MB aggregate peak at 664
nm is shown in Figure 5C. These results indicate that at elevated temperature, where the
gel is unstable, MB is released into the solution. This
finding supports the conclusion that MB aggregation is
inhibited by association with TAP–CyCo6 monomers
and supramolecular polymers.

changes in absorbance

buffer (black) and in the presence of 30 mM TAP–CyCo6 assembly (red).

Reversible Reduction of MB to LMB
MB behaves as a noncovalent chain stopper, in part,
because it is positively charged and planar. LMB is nonplanar
and neutral, and for these reasons, it is not expected to behave as
a noncovalent chain stopper. We examined the redox reactions of AA and O2 in the presence of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies on MB and LMB. Addition of
50 mM of AA to a solution containing 0.25 mM MB (a 200-fold excess of AA compared to MB) and 30 mM of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies results in
the nearly complete loss of the MB absorption signal
(Figure 6A). The MB spectrum reappears at almost its previous intensity when
the solution is purged with O2 for 5 min.

Gel to Sol Transformation of Supramolecular Polymer by Redox
Switching of MB and LMB
The reversible
conversion of MB to LMB causes the reversible
transition of the TAP–CyCo6 gel to a solution.
The vial inversion test was used to observe sol–gel transitions
(Figure 6C). This test
was performed on vials containing solutions of 30 mM TAP–CyCo6 alone, those containing TAP–CyCo6 and 0.25 mM MB before and after the addition 50 mM AA, and
finally after purging the AA-containing vials with O2 for 5 min. The results are shown in Figure 6. Addition of MB to the gel
results in its conversion to a solution. This transition is reversed
by the addition of AA, and then purging the solution
with O2 regenerates the MB and converts the
gel into a free-flowing solution. Deoxygenation enables the competitive
reduction of MB to LMB by AA and regenerates the gel. This was accomplished either by heating
the solution of TAP–CyCo6 and LMB to 60 °C, which rapidly consumes all of the O2,
or by flowing N2 through the mixture.

The sol–gel
transition of TAP–CyCo6 is pH dependent.10TAP and CyCo6 form
their most stable supramolecular assemblies and thereby the hydrogels
when the pH of the solution equals their pKa (ca. 7); however, the hydrogel dissolves at pH 6 and pH 8. Consequently,
it was necessary to separate the effect of pH change from the reduction
of MB that is caused by addition of AA to
solutions of TAP–CyCo6 (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The gradual addition
of various concentrations of AA (0–100 mM) to
200 mM phosphate buffer lowers the pH from ca. 7 to ca. 5.7. The pH
of a sample containing 20 mM of TAP–CyCo6 in the
phosphate buffer solution was measured before and after the addition
of 50 mM of AA. The addition of AA results
in a change in pH from 7.0 to 6.5. This change causes a ca. 30% decrease in the amount of assembled monomers compared with
that at pH 7. In contrast to the effect of lowered pH alone, the addition
of AA to solutions of 0.25 mM MB and TAP–CyCo6 assemblies lowers the pH, forms LMB, and increases the length of the assemblies, eventually
reforming the gel (Figure 6C). The effects of AA on pH and on LMB formation operate on the gel in opposite directions. Thus, the reformation
of TAP–CyCo6 assemblies is a direct consequence
of MB reduction to LMB by AA.

Reversibility of MB-Mediated Redox Switching
We examined
reversibility of the MB- to LMB-induced
sol–gel transition of TAP–CyCo6 polymers.
We compared the rates of reduction of 0.25 mM solutions of MB and AA in a solution containing only 200 mM phosphate
buffer and in a solution that also contained 20 mM of TAP–CyCo6 assembly. The rate of the reduction of MB to LMB is reduced by the supramolecular polymer (Figure S4, Supporting Information). This decreased rate
of reduction complicates the bleaching of MB because
diffusion of O2 from the air interface competitively reoxidizes
the LMB to MB. To eliminate this problem,
the reduction of MB by AA was carried out
at 60 °C, where it is rapid because the TAP–CyCo6 assemblies are not stable under these conditions. The gel is reformed
when the solution is cooled to room temperature.

The reversibility
of the redox-coupled sol–gel transition was examined. A sample
containing 0.25 mM of MB and of 30 mM TAP–CyCo6 assembly was reduced with 25 mM AA at 60 °C, allowed
to cool to room temperature, and then purged for 5 min with O2. This constitutes one cycle that included conversion of the MB-containing solution to a LMB-containing gel
and then back to a MB-containing solution. The process
was monitored by absorption spectroscopy and repeated for 11 cycles
(Figure 6B). The results
demonstrate that the reversible redox cycling of MB to LMB is robust and in the presence of a large excess of AA, it can be used to repeatedly control the gel to sol transition.
There is an initial reduction in the amount of MB in
solution caused by the precipitation of LMB, which is
less soluble than MB, but the system stabilizes after
three cycles. The reversible gel to sol transformation of TAP–CyCo6 assembly and the difference in viscoelastic properties of the solutions
containing MB and shorter fibers, and the decolorized
gel containing LMB and longer fibers was recorded in
a video that is included in the Supporting Information (Video S1).

The reversible gel to solution
transformation of TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular assemblies
by the reduction of MB to LMB was further
investigated by AFM (Figure 7A,B). Micron length linear fibers of untreated TAP–CyCo6 assemblies show a concentration-dependent
decrease in their length in the presence of MB. The reduction
of MB to LMB by AA results
in the reformation of the micron length polymers (Figure 7B).

after adding AA (long fibers).
All samples contain phosphate buffer, pH 7 (200 mM).

Conclusions
In summary, TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular polymers
interact with MB. The spectroscopic and physical data
are all consistent with MB acting as a noncovalent chain
stopper that binds electrostatically to polymer ends leading to shorter
fibers and the concomitant loss of gelation. The reduction of MB by AA to LMB, which does not
act as a noncovalent chain stopper for TAP–CyCo6 polymers because it is uncharged and nonplanar, results in the reformation
of the gel phase. The reoxidation of LMB to MB by O2 regenerates the solution phase. This reversible
redox coupled sol–gel transition can be repeated at least a
dozen times. Notably, this switchable hydrogel system does not require
synthetic modification of the monomers. This finding provides a simple,
noninvasive approach to control the assembly of these and related
supramolecular polymers, which may aid in the development of gel-based
materials.

Experimental Details
Sample Preparation
Supramolecular polymers for this
work were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of CyCo6 and TAP in 200 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7. MB was added to a preformed TAP–CyCo6 supramolecular
assembly, and the mixture was heated to 60 °C and cooled to ensure
complete mixing of MB with TAP–CyCo6 hexads. Unless otherwise noted, the preparation of assemblies and
all experiments were carried out at 20 °C. CyCo6 was synthesized according to the previously reported method and
its purity was determined by NMR spectroscopy and liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LCMS). pH was measured with a VWR 8100 pH meter equipped
with an InLab semimicro combination electrode.

NMR and UV Absorption Analyses
NMR analyses were performed
in D2O on a Bruker DRX-500 NMR spectrometer. The
spectra were summed over 32 transients. UV–vis analyses were
carried out on an Agilent 8453 spectrophotometer equipped with an
89090A temperature controller. Cells of 1 mm path length were used
for absorption measurements. Assembly solutions investigated by NMR
spectroscopy contained 90% H2O and 10% D2O and
were observed using the WATERGATE pulse sequence. 3-(Trimethylsilyl)propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt was used as an internal standard,
which did not show any indication of interacting with or being incorporated
within the assemblies.

AFM Imaging
AFM imaging was performed on freshly cleaved
mica. The mica substrate was rinsed with water and dried under N2. A 3 μL sample of the assembly solution was spread
over the mica using N2 flow and was dried with N2 gas. AFM imaging was performed with a Nanoscope IIIa (Digital Instruments)
in the tapping mode, using Si tips (Vistaprobes, 48 N/m).

Dynamic Light Scattering
DLS experiments were carried
out using a DynaPro MS/X dynamic light scattering instrument (Proterion,
Piscataway, NJ) with a laser wavelength of 830 nm and a constant scattering
collection angle of 90° at room temperature. Each measurement
reported is the average of 20 s scattering intensity accumulations.
