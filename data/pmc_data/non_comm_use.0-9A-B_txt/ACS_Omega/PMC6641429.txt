Y2O3 was in situ deposited on a freshly grown
molecular beam epitaxy GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface by atomic layer
deposition (ALD). In situ synchrotron radiation photoemission was
used to study the mechanism of the tris(ethylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium
[Y(CpEt)3] and H2O process. The exponential
attenuation of Ga 3d photoelectrons confirmed the laminar growth of
ALD-Y2O3. In the embryo stage of the first ALD
half-cycle with only Y(CpEt)3, the precursors reside on
the faulted As atoms and undergo a charge transfer to the bonded As
atoms. The subsequent ALD half-cycle of H2O molecules removes
the bonded As atoms, and the oxygen atoms bond with the underneath
Ga atoms. The product of a line of Ga–O–Y bonds stabilizes
the Y2O3 films on the GaAs substrate. The resulting
coordinatively unsaturated Y–O pairs of Y2O3 open the next ALD series. The absence of Ga2O3, As2O3, and As2O5 states may play an important role in the attainment of low interfacial
trap densities (Dit) of <1012 cm–2 eV–1 in our established
reports.

1 Introduction
Atomic layer deposition
(ALD) is a technique that uses chemical
vapor depositions for the sequential use of self-terminating gas–solid
reactions. High-quality ALD high-κ dielectric films, which are
effectively deposited on semiconductors with the thickness from sub-monolayer
(ML) to a thick film and a conformal coverage, have greatly improved
the device performances of complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor
field-effect transistors.1,2 The scaling-down oxide
layers with nanometer thicknesses are essential to achieve high-performance
microelectronic devices. A thin high-quality oxide film demands a
high-quality oxide–semiconductor interface. The high-κ/metal
gate technology, which is key to the success of Si complementary MOS
devices since the 45 nm node, has a thin ALD-HfO2-based
dielectric on silicates (∼0.4 nm thick) but not directly on
Si. In fact, high-κ materials that are directly grown on an
HF-dipped Si surface result in retardation nucleation and rough surfaces.3 A more two-dimensional (2D) growth and better
dielectric properties for ALD oxides require a Si surface with more
functional groups such as OH– for the high reactivity
of the metal precursors.4

We may
obtain precise knowledge of the interfacial electronic structure
and crystallography on an atomic level, with a semiconductor surface
with a long-range order and atomic cleanliness. The literature contains
many studies on ALD-oxide films, but few studies mention the growth
mode of the oxide in the embryo stage at the oxide–semiconductor
interface. Thus, the present investigation is motivated to reach the
fine region of a single precursor molecule in contact with the single
surface atom of a semiconductor substrate.

We specifically selected
the system of ALD-Y2O3 on freshly molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown pristine GaAs(001)-4
× 6 because the oxide film orients itself along the surface normal
(110), which shows a single-domain single-crystalline cubic phase.5,6 Moreover, the interfacial trap density (Dit) is low (<1012 cm–2 eV–1), and the Dit distribution within the
GaAs band gap is flat without a peak bulge in the midgap.7 A similar 3+ oxide, such as Al2O3, fails to return with such excellent electric
performances.8−13 In situ synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES)
was used to study the interfacial electronic structure of the film
in sub-ML thickness to bulk. Note that the pristine GaAs(001)-4 ×
6 has no functional OH– group to react with the
metal precursors and does not react with pure H2O. We explore
how Y2O3 grows on GaAs on an atomic level under
ALD.

We have found that the tris(ethylcyclopentadienyl)yttrium,
Y(CpEt)3, precursors selectively adsorb onto the faulted
terrace of
the GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface. The H2O precursors remove
the As atoms bonded with Y(CpEt)3 and consequently bond
with the underneath Ga atoms. A line of Ga–O–Y bonds
is generated, which stabilizes the Y2O3 films
on the GaAs substrate. As a result, the coordinatively unsaturated
Y–O pairs open the next cycle of the alternated Y(CpEt)3 and H2O process. A complete growth model of a
series of sequential self-termination gas–solid reactions for
the ALD-Y2O3/GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface is
presented.

2 Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
As 3d, Ga 3d, and Y 4s core level spectra taken with 120 eV photon
energy in various Y2O3 coverages in unit of
angstroms on an atomically clean p-type GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface.
We have normalized the photoelectron intensity to the background height
to observe the spectral evolution. The binding energy (BE) is related
to the Fermi level (EF), which is determined
by a freshly deposited silver film in flush and in the ground with
the sample holder. As shown in Figure 1, the intensity of the Y 4s peak gradually increases
with a simultaneous decrease in the intensity of the As 3d and Ga
3d peaks. Clearly, the Y2O3 dielectric oxide
can be successfully grown on the GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface by ALD
without being precovered with a functional group as OH–. The core levels show a decrease in the intensity, and the line
shape has also dissimilarly revolved from the clean surface. The former
behavior indicates the growth mode of the oxide, and the latter indicates
the atom-to-atom interaction at the oxide/GaAs interface.

Figure 1 Evolution of
the As 3d, Ga 3d, and Y 4s core level spectra taken
with photon energy of 120 eV for ALD-Y2O3 on
a p-GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface.

First, let us discuss the growth mode. The summed areas of
both
As 3d and Ga 3d lines in a given energy window with various Y2O3 coverages are plotted in Figure 2. The attenuation curve (black solid line)
of an ideal layer-by-layer (laminar) growth is included for comparison.
Our previous study demonstrated that the ALD-Y2O3 film was epitaxially grown on GaAs(001)-4 × 6 along the (110)
direction,5,6 which is identical to MBE-Gd2O3 on GaAs(001).14 One ML is
defined to be 3.75 Å, which is one-half of the lattice constant
of Y2O3(110). λAs and λGa are the inelastic mean free paths (IMFPs) of As and Ga 3d
photoelectrons through the Y2O3 overlayer, respectively.
Because the IMFP is a function of the element and kinetic energy,
the used photon energy makes the values of λAs and
λGa 15.99 and 17.41 Å, respectively.15 As displayed in Figure 2a, the Ga 3d signal almost follows the expected
characteristics for a laminar Y2O3 film growth,
which is consistent with previous reflection high-energy electron
diffraction (RHEED) results.5,6 By contrast, the intensity
of As 3d decreases below the referenced 2D growth curve (Figure 2b). This behavior
is abnormal for the ordered laminar Y2O3 film
and warrants further investigation. Argument on the diffusion of the
As atoms to the Y2O3 overlayer fails to explain
the attenuation data under the 2D growth curve because the intensity
in the highly surface sensitive scan would be enhanced, and the slower
attenuation rate should make the data above the 2D growth curve. One
possible explanation is that the surface As atoms have been removed
during the ALD process.

Figure 2 Attenuation of the relative signal area at various
Y2O3 coverages for the (a) Ga 3d and (b) As
3d core level
spectra. The exponentially decayed curves for an ideal laminar growth
are plotted in black solid lines.

For a layer-wise film as the present Y2O3, the intensity I of the core level photoelectron
emission from the GaAs substrate attenuates with coverage θ
as follows 1  where λ is the IMFP of photoelectrons
through the Y2O3 overlayer and Io is the intensity of the photoelectrons for a clean GaAs
surface, which is determined as 2  

In eq 2, Is is the intensity of the photoelectrons emitted from
the surface atoms; do is the one-ML thickness
of GaAs(001), which is defined to be 2.83 Å and one-half of the
lattice constant of GaAs(001); and λo is the IMFP
of photoelectrons through the GaAs sample. We assume that the x percentage of the surface atoms is removed, and eq 1 becomes 3  

The intensity IAs over IGa in a given thickness
is calculated as 4  

The As–Ga
signal ratio was measured in a scan that simultaneously
covered the As 3d and Ga 3d core levels to avoid the fluctuated photon
flux in different measurements of I and Io. The As–Ga intensity ratios for the clean and
23 Å covered surfaces are 0.53 and 0.45, respectively. A thick
film is selected to bypass the interfacial reaction. The values of
λo,As, λAs, and λGa are 10.41, 15.99, and 17.41 Å, respectively.15 The insertion of these values to eqs 2 and 4 returns the value
of x, which
is approximately 18%.

Ohtake et al. proposed a model for the
GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface
(Figure 3a).16 There are 24 As atoms per unit cell above the
almost undisturbed Ga layer, which amounts to 1 atomic layer of As
atoms. Twelve of these As atoms have four Ga neighbors and properties
similar to those of the bulk As. The remaining 12 As atoms have 3
Ga neighbors and exist in 4 different environments (3 environments
if a minor difference is ignored), which correspond to populations
of 2, 4, and 6 and are marked as As(3), As(1), and As(2), respectively.
In the established reports, we have demonstrated that the As(1), As(2),
and As(3) atoms are parts of the As 3d core level spectrum with the
bulk component.17,18 The detailed energy positions
of the surface As atoms are shown in Figure 3b. The As(1) component predominates the emission
on the high BE side and is shifted by 0.14 eV, whereas both As(2)
and As(3) components are on the low BE side and are shifted by 0.19
and 0.59 eV, respectively. The x value of 18% is
the occupancy of the faulted terrace As(1) atoms in the surface unit
cell. In other words, the As(1) atoms are subjected to be totally
removed upon deposition of one ML of ALD-Y2O3.

Figure 3 (a) Unit cell of the GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface; (b) fit to the
corresponding As 3d core level spectrum.

Now, we discuss the change in the line shape. An analysis
of the
line shape of the As 3d and Ga 3d core level spectra in the embryo
stage will justify the aforementioned proposal. Figure 4a displays the half-cycle Y(CpEt)3-only spectra plotted on top of the clean surface counterparts (black
curves) for close comparisons. The BE calibration maintains the same
precision as in Figure 1. As displayed in Figure 4a, the Y(CpEt)3 precursors have different effects
on the Ga and As surface atoms. They simply bypass the Ga atoms and
leave the energy position and line shape of the Ga 3d core level spectrum
virtually unaltered. However, the precursors introduce a tail to the
As 3d core level spectrum mainly in the high-energy region but not
in the low-energy region. Clearly, the Y(CpEt)3 precursors
tend to affiliate to the As(1) atoms instead of As(2) and As(3) atoms.
Furthermore, the inset of Figure 4a shows the spectral cutoff region, where the Y(CpEt)3/GaAs(001) system distinctly marks the cutoff shift from the
GaAs(001) surface. Because the band-bending effect is absent in the
Ga 3d states induced by the Y(CpEt)3 precursors, the 0.35
eV downward movement indicates that the local vacuum level drops because
of the presence of the surface dipoles with the direction pointing
outward.19,20 The surface dipoles are generated between
the Y(CpEt)3 and As(1) atoms. Because Y(CpEt)3 is not a polar molecule, the surface dipole likely results from
the charge-transfer effect. Recently, we have illustrated a unique
surface characteristic of GaAs(001), which exhibits high surface electronegativity.21 With this characteristic and the direction of
the surface dipole, a bonding state will appear at a lower energy
position than the As(1) component. Indeed, a fit to the Y(CpEt)3-covered As 3d core level spectrum would resolve an induced
As–Y component at a few tenth million electronvolts from the
As(1) component (Figure 4b). The strength of the As–Y component grows with the expense
of the As(1) component. Note that neither As(2) nor As(3) components
in Figure 4b show any
intensity decrease in a fit. The As* component must be included in
the model function for a proper fit (see below). The interfacial reaction
schematic is drawn in Figure 4c.

(b) fit to the As 3d core level spectrum for half cycle; (c) schematic
drawing for the reaction between Y(CpEt)3 and the GaAs(001)-4
× 6 surface.

Figure 5a shows
the acquired core level spectra of a complete ALD cycle, which includes
the H2O precursors with representations of one and three
cycles of depositions. The growth rate of Y2O3 is 0.4 Å per cycle in the sub-ML region. The plot is normalized
to a constant peak height in reference to a zero background. Here,
we discuss the a priori evolution of the Ga 3d core level spectra. Figure 5a shows that the
H2O purge affects the Ga 3d line shape to show an induced
state (Ga*) at a high BE tail, which gradually increases in strength
with increasing cycles of deposition. The line shape with a fit is
analyzed in Figure 5b. Three surface-related Ga(1), Ga(2), and Ga(3) components are found
at −0.19, +0.22, and +0.44 eV, respectively, relative to the
bulk component Ga(B). Upon the growth of the ALD-Y2O3 oxide, the Ga* component grows at the expense of the Ga(1)
component. According to the resolved energy position at 20.10 eV,
the Ga* component is likely associated with Ga2O (Ga+).22 In other words, the Ga(1)
atoms begin to bond with oxygen, that is, the oxygen atom in H2O has replaced the bonding role of Y(CpEt)3 to
bond with the Ga atoms. Because the Ga(1) atoms are beneath the As(1)
atoms in the faulted terrace, the As(1) atoms become stripped off
in the exchange reaction. The removed As atoms appear as the As* component
on the high-energy tail of the 3d spectrum (left panel of Figure 5b). The increased
cycles of deposition gradually decrease the intensity of the As(1)
component and enhance the strength of the As* region. Note that the
As–Y component in the half-cycle spectrum is no longer present.
The bonding role of Ga is not unreasonable because the bonded As(1)
atom with extra charge from Y(CpEt)3 in it has weakened
the original As–Ga bonds because of charge redistribution.
Consequently, the following N2 purge and high pressure
of the H2O vapor in the ALD processes easily remove the
bonded As(1) atoms. The 41.5 eV BE of As* suggests that it is neither
from As2O3 (44.3 eV) nor from As2O5 (45.3 eV), but instead from pure As.22 In a separate experiment on an annealed ALD-Y2O3 (8 cycles)/GaAs(001)-4 × 6, as shown in Figure 6, heat immediately
wipes off the As* component, suggesting that it could not be associated
with the interfacial bonding state, but rather with the freed As in
the oxide overlayer. It is noted that the Ga2O (Ga+)-like state, Ga*, does not result in the gap state.23−26 The absence of the interface defect state from the Ga2O3 (Ga3+)-like gap state (20.70 eV)22 explains well the low Dit (<1012 cm–2 eV–1) in our previous study (ref (7)).24,25

as-grown sample, and the
hollow red line presents the annealed sample.

Figure 7 shows
the
development of the Y 3d core level spectra at a photon energy of 190
eV from sub-ML to a thick Y2O3 film. The BE
of the Y 3d5/2 state below 4.6 Å of thickness appears
at approximately 158.20 eV, which suggests that the stoichiometric
Y2O3 oxide has already formed at this sub-ML
coverage.27 Nevertheless, the energy position
is 0.68 eV higher than that of a thick Y2O3 film.
The behavior is not unusual but reflects a change of the Y chemical
environment. A similar phenomenon occurs at the Y2O3/Si interface, where Y shows a transition from yttrium silicate
at the interface to pure Y2O3 when the film
grows.28,29 Presently, the Y atom has the Ga atom as
the second nearest neighbor for the Y–O–Ga bonding configuration
at the interface, which is in contrast to Y in Y2O3 in the Y–O–Y configuration. The differences
in the electronegativity of Ga, O, and Y further cause the observed
energy shift. Note that the shift occurs after one ML of coverage.

of 190 eV for ALD-Y2O3 on a p-GaAs(001)-4 ×
6 surface.

The development of the O 1s core
level spectra acquired by in situ
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is shown in Figure 8. Two peaks appear in every
Y2O3 coverage. Components O–Y and O*
appear at approximately 529.8 and 531.8 eV, respectively. O in the
O–Y component is emitted from the stoichiometric Y2O3 film,27−31 whereas O in the O* component is emitted from the Ga–O–Y
bonding configuration at the interfacial layer and O–H on the
surface originates from water absorption.29−31 The Ga–O–Y
bond dominates the O* component in the sub-ML coverage, which is replaced
by O–H in a thick Y2O3 film.

the O 1s core level spectra measured by in situ XPS
for ALD-Y2O3 on a p-GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface.

The schematic drawing of the interfacial
reaction in the embryo
stage is plotted in Figure 9. First, the Y(CpEt)3 precursors bond with the
surface As(1) atoms, and the listed reaction is written as 5  where the symbol ∥ denotes the surface
group and (g) denotes the molecule in the gas phase. The next water
vapor deposition activates the ligand-exchange reaction to remove
the As(1) atom. Y2O3 is produced and bonds with
Ga via oxygen as follows 6  

Figure 9 Schematic drawing of Y(CpEt)3 precursors (a) deposited
on GaAs(001)-4 × 6, (b) with subsequent H2O deposition.

Gaseous C7H10 and most freed As atoms are
readily purged off by nitrogen in the ALD processes. Note that Ga–O
bonds provide a strong bonding strength to stabilize the Y2O3 layer bonded with GaAs. However, the size of the Y2O3 unit is 5.3 Å,32 which is close to the lattice constant of 5.65 Å of GaAs(001).
The steric hindrance effects caused by the ligands promote the growth
of Y2O3 films, which tilt into the (110) direction5,6 to relax in a spacious region.

After the GaAs surface is completely
covered with Y2O3, the growth of the Y2O3 film
can be referred to that of the Al2O3 film using
trimethylaluminum and water as the precursors.33 In other words, the Y(CpEt)3 precursor in the
next cycle dissociatively reacts with coordinatively unsaturated Y–O
pairs and becomes 7  

The H2O deposition to complete the ALD cycle becomes 8  and 9  

Again, the
gaseous products are removed from the ALD chamber by
the nitrogen purges. Equations 8 and 9 show that the Y2O3 film surface is always terminated with an OH– functional group, which is gradually stacked by the sequential use
of self-termination gas–solid reactions.

3 Conclusions
We have investigated the embryo stage of ALD precursor adsorption
on GaAs(001)-4 × 6 using Y(CpEt)3 and H2O as the cycling agents. The intensity evolution and line shape change
of Ga 3d, As 3d, Y 3d, and O 1s states are coherently followed in
the study. We have found that the Y(CpEt)3 precursors mainly
reside on the faulted terrace in the embryo stage. The footed As atoms
are readily removed upon H2O deposition and N2 purge. The oxygen atom in H2O takes over the bonding
role with the Ga atom. In the present system, the faulted As atoms
are removed, and the Y2O3/GaAs(001) interface
forms with the Ga2O (Ga+)-like bonds along the
terrace. The attainment of low Dit of
<1012 cm–2 eV–1 in
our previous study may be attributed to the absence of Ga2O3, As2O3, and As2O5 states. In contrast to the high-κ oxides on Si, the
ALD-Y2O3 oxide was successfully grown on the
GaAs(001)-4 × 6 surface without being precovered with a functional
group OH–; thus, the thickness of the high-κ
oxide layer is significantly reduced in practical applications. After
one-ML Y2O3 is formed, the coordinately unsaturated
Y–O pairs open the next cycle of the alternated Y(CpEt)3 and H2O process.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 ALD-Y2O3 Growth
The MBE chamber, ALD reactor, and analysis chamber of XPS were in
a multichamber ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) growth/analysis system. All
chambers were connected via transfer modules, which were maintained
at 10–10 Torr to ensure that the sample surfaces
are free of contamination in the entire process. GaAs epi-layers (Be-doped,
1 × 1017 cm–3) were grown on 2in.
diameter p-type GaAs(001) substrates using a solid-source GaAs-based
MBE.34 A 4 × 6 reconstructed GaAs
surface was obtained by annealing the samples to 550 °C, as examined
by RHEED. The freshly MBE-grown GaAs(001)-4 × 6 sample was in
situ transferred to the ALD reactor under UHV. The ALD-Y2O3 process was performed with the precursors, Y(CpEt)3 and H2O.6,35 Y(CpEt)3 was injected into the reactor with a pulse time of 2.1 s; then,
high-purity N2 (99.9999%) purge was performed for 10 s.
To increase the dosage of Y(CpEt)3 precursors in an ALD
cycle, the aforementioned sequence was repeated three times before
introducing H2O vapor to complete the ALD cycle. The dosage
of H2O vapor per ALD cycle was maintained once with a pulse
time of 2.1 s; however, the subsequent N2 purge time was
reduced to 8 s. The ambient temperature of growth was set at 270 °C.

4.2 Transfer
The SRPES experiments were
performed at the National Synchrotron Radiation Research Center in
Taiwan, which is approximately 7 km from the film growth laboratory.
Thus, the Y2O3/GaAs(001)-4 × 6 sample was
transferred to the SRPES end station via a portable UHV chamber, in
which a pressure below 5 × 10–10 Torr was maintained
to retain the contamination-free surface.36

4.3 Characterization
The SRPES photoelectrons
were collected and analyzed using a 150 mm hemispherical analyzer
(SPECS) in a UHV chamber, in which the base pressure was less than
5.0 × 10–10 Torr. Monochromatic radiation was
provided via a low-energy spherical grating monochromator with photon
energies of 20–200 eV. The energy resolution was estimated
by the full width at half-maximum of a Gaussian function, which was
fitted with the Fermi edge slope of the valence band spectrum of the
Ag reference film mounted on the metal sample holder. Here, the resolution
of approximately 70 meV for a photon energy of 120 eV was obtained.

The O 1s core level spectra were analyzed using in situ high-resolution
XPS with an Al Kα (1486.7 eV) monochromatic X-ray source. An
energy resolution of approximately 0.25 eV was obtained by fitting
the Fermi edge of the Au reference film. The atomic ratio of Y–O
in the Y2O3 film was deduced from a comparison
of the relative signal area of the Y 3d and O 1s states in the survey
XPS data. The sensitivity factors for a photon energy of 1486.7 eV
were obtained from the tabulated cross-sections and had values of
0.082 for Y 3d and 0.04 for O 1s.37 As
a result, the atomic ratio of Y–O is 0.65 ± 0.02 for the
Y2O3 thickness of above 9 Å, which is identical
to that of stoichiometric Y2O3.
