For a strategic incorporation
of both π-electron-rich moieties
and Lewis basic moieties acting as hydrogen bonding recognition sites
in the same molecule, two new fluorescent sensors, N,N′-bis(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine
(banthbpbn, 1) and N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine (bnaphbpbn, 2), have been developed for the selective
detection of highly explosive 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP) in water.
Each of the two identical ends of these sensors that are linked with
a flexible tetra-methylene spacer contains a mixed aromatic bicyclic
fused ring (anthracene or naphthalene) and a pyridyl group. These
are synthesized via the simple reduced Schiff base chemistry, followed
by the nucleophilic substitution reaction under basic conditions in
high yields. Both 1 and 2 were characterized
by Fourier transform infrared, UV–vis, and NMR (1H and 13C) spectroscopy, and high-resolution mass spectrometry.
The bulk phase purity of 1 and 2 and their
stability in water were confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).
Utilizing the effect of solvents on their emission spectra as determined
by fluorescence spectroscopy, spectral responses for 1 and 2 toward various nitro explosives were recorded
to determine a detection limit of 0.6 and 1.6 ppm, respectively, for
TNP in water via the “turn-off” quenching response.
Also, the detailed mechanistic investigation for their mode of action
through spectral overlap, lifetime measurements, Stern–Volmer
plots, and density functional theory calculations reveals that resonance
energy transfer and photoinduced electron transfer processes, and
electrostatic interactions are the key aspects for the turn-off response
toward TNP by 1 and 2. In addition, the
selectivity for TNP has been found to be more in 1 compared
to 2. Both exhibit good recyclability and stability after
sensing experiments, which is confirmed by PXRD and field-emission
scanning electron microscopy.

Introduction
Design and development
of fluorescent sensors for the highly selective
and sensitive detection of hazardous nitro explosives (NEs) are one
of the essential concerns from the viewpoint of national/international
security and safety because of unpredicted terrorist attacks and industrial
disasters.1,2 These NEs are also used in fireworks, dyes,
and landmines, posing threat to the humankind and environment owing
to their detonation properties.3 Among
the various NEs, such as 2,4,6-trinitrophenol (TNP), 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene
(TNT), 2,6-dinitrotoluene (2,6-DNT), 1,3,5-trinitro-1,3,5-triazacyclohexane,
and nitrobenzene (NB), TNP being highly acidic and soluble in water
gets easily accumulated in the soil and agricultural land, causing
contamination and health hazards.4 Thus,
highly selective and prompt detection of TNP in aqueous medium is
significantly important. Diverse analytical techniques such as electrochemical,
mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and fluorescence spectroscopy
have been utilized for the detection of NEs, but the detection based
on fluorescence emission is the most advantageous one because of its
high sensitivity, quick response time, and real-time monitoring.5

Till date, many fluorescent materials such
as metal–organic
frameworks,6 covalent organic frameworks,7 conjugated polymers,8 carbon dots,9 and cages10 have been developed for the detection of TNP. However,
their preparation requires high temperature conditions and multistep
synthesis. Thus, there is still demand for the design of sensors with
easy synthetic methods. Although many chemosensors have been developed
for sensing of TNP in dimethylformamide (DMF), dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), and other organic solvents,6a−6f,7,10−12 for practical purposes, selective sensing of TNP
in water is desired.6g−6m,8b,13 However, in many cases, it is not suitable because of aggregation-caused
quenching (ACQ) in the presence of water and also because of the tendency
of water to form hydrogen bonding with TNP.13a As a consequence, for developing sensors devoid of such limitations,
it is still a challenging task. The essential criteria for designing
suitable sensors for the detection of electron-deficient NEs are as
follows: (i) π-electron-rich cloud in the molecule which can
provide effective π–π interactions with the electron-poor
NEs, (ii) the presence of Lewis basic sites that can further form
noncovalent interactions like H-bonding with the nitrophenol derivatives,
and (iii) the presence of some bulky substituents at the periphery
that can prevent any self-aggregation which can lead to the formation
of intermolecular excimers (causing ACQ).14 Herein, considering these criteria, we have designed and synthesized
two organic fluorescent sensors, N,N′-bis(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl) butane-1,4-diamine (banthbpbn, 1) and N,N′-bis(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine
(bnaphbpbn, 2), with two different hydrophobic
pendant moieties, namely, aromatic bicyclic fused rings (anthracene
or naphthalene, respectively) and Lewis basic pyridyl groups. In our
design, the fluorescent tags (anthracene or naphthalene) provide effective
π–π stacking with the NEs while the pyridyl groups
play dual roles: (i) act as the Lewis basic recognition sites for
the acidic NEs via the hydrogen bonding interactions (H-bonding) and
(ii) act as the bulky group to restrict the generation of any self-aggregation
(see Figure 1). Thus,
we have envisaged that an interplay of the abovementioned criteria
can be made possible with the strategic incorporation of both the
fluorescent tags and the Lewis basic sites in these sensors. In fact,
the fluorescent sensors 1 and 2 have been
found to show solid-mediated selective detection of TNP in water through
a turn-off response with a detection limit of 0.6 and 1.6 ppm, respectively.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
For
the synthesis of 1 and 2, a general two-step
method has been developed
with excellent yields of 85 and 92%, respectively, as illustrated
in Scheme 1. In the
first step, a Schiff base reaction between anthracene or naphthalene
carboxaldehyde and 1,4-diaminobutane (in a 2:1 ratio) followed by
the reduction of the respective imine produces the intermediate H2banthbn or H2bnaphbn, respectively. The
second step involves the introduction of a methylpyridyl group at
each alkyl nitrogen atom via the nucleophilic substitution under strongly
basic conditions. Both 1 and 2 were extensively
characterized by 1H and 13C NMR, Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR), and UV–vis spectroscopy and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS) (see Figures S1–S13). In the 1H NMR spectra, the presence of two singlets
at 3.68 and 4.48 ppm in 1 and 3.75 and 4.04 ppm in 2 are attributed to the CH2 groups attached to
2-picolyl and anthracene or naphthalene, respectively. As expected,
in their FTIR spectra, there were no peak at around 1700 and 3200
cm–1 for CHO and NH groups, confirming the formation
of pure products. The HRMS data showing the presence of the parent
ion peaks of 1 and 2 further confirmed their
purity. Their phase purity and crystallinity of the bulk were confirmed
by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD).

of 1 and 2
Solvent Effect on Emission Spectra
Both 1 and 2 were soluble in DMF and chloroform (CHCl3), partially soluble in dimethylsulfoxide, and insoluble in
water (H2O), methanol (CH3OH), and NB. Having
high solubility in DMF and CHCl3, the emission intensities
of 1 and 2 were fully quenched because of
ACQ. In the case of NB, the presence of an electron-deficient nitro
group led to the turn-off response via electron transfer from electron-rich
sensors 1 and 2. On the other hand, the
maximum emission intensity of 1 and 2 was
observed in H2O followed by CH3OH and CH3CN, attributing to aggregation-induced enhanced emission (see Figure S14). To get better insight into the effect
of solvents on their emission spectra, solid-state emission spectra
of 1 and 2 were recorded upon excitation
at the same wavelength of the aqueous suspension. A broad peak at
467 nm for 1 and a very broad peak at 427 nm for 2 are observed, with significantly lower intensity for 2 (see Figure S15). Comparing their
emission peaks in aqueous solution, it is clear that an excimer formation
takes place in 1 because of self-aggregation, which is
much more pronounced in 2 because of less bulky naphthalene
moiety. These observations confirm that H2O, CH3OH, and CH3CN solvents play an important role to prevent
quenching due to self-aggregation and enhance the emission intensities
of 1 and 2 in solution.

Emission Spectral
Response toward NEs
The high luminescent
property of 1 and 2 due to the presence
of both π-conjugated cores and Lewis basic pyridyl sites has
been utilized for sensing different electron-deficient NEs such as
TNP, 2,4-dinitrophenol (2,4-DNP), 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), 2,6-DNT, TNT,
1,3-dinitrobenzene (1,3-DNB), and NB. Inspired from the aforementioned
results of the solvent effect on emission spectra, H2O
has been selected as the solvent medium. To investigate the sensing
ability of 1 and 2 toward various NEs, their
dispersed solutions in water (1 mg in 2 mL H2O) were prepared
to facilitate close contact between the sensors and the NEs. The fluorescence
intensities were monitored at 420 and 450 nm for 1 and 2, respectively, upon the incremental addition of aqueous
solutions (0–200 μL of a 1 mM stock solution) of different
NEs (see Figures 2 and S16–S27). As anticipated, fluorescence
spectra of both sensors upon the addition of TNP displayed turn-off
responses. Also, the fluorescence quenching of 1 is higher
than that of 2. This can be correlated to the decrease
in the π-conjugation from anthracene to naphthalene, which may
lead to less π–π interactions between the aromatic
rings of the sensor and those of the NEs in 2 compared
to 1.

Figure 2 Change in emission spectra of (a) 1 and (b) 2 dispersed in water upon the incremental addition of TNP
solution (1 mM) in water.

The quenching efficiency percentage was calculated using
the formula
(I0 – I)/I0 × 100%, where I0 and I are the luminescent intensities of
the sensors before and after the addition of the nitroanalytes, respectively
(see Figure 3). The
quenching efficiency for 1 and 2 with 200
μL TNP is 98 and 90%, respectively. Also, 1 shows
more selectivity toward TNP among all NEs with respect to quenching
% compared to 2. Moreover, the detection limits of TNP
calculated using the formula 3σ/m were found to be 0.6 and 1.6
ppm for 1 and 2, respectively (see Figures S28,S29).

Figure 3 Comparison of quenching
% of different NEs in water for 1 and 2.

Mechanistic Studies
To gain better insight into the
quenching mechanism for TNP, Stern–Volmer (SV) quenching constants
were calculated using the SV equation I0/I = 1 + KSV[A], where, I0 and I are fluorescence intensities
before and after the addition of NEs, respectively, [A] is the molar
concentration of the nitroanalyte, and KSV is the quenching constant (M–1), as depicted in Figure 4. The KSV values were found to be 5.78 × 104 and
3.26 × 104 for 1 and 2,
respectively (see Figures S30,S31). As
evident from these values, the interaction with TNP is much stronger
in 1 compared to 2. These KSV values are comparable or better than those reported
in the literature (see Table S1). The Ksv values of 1 and 2 are greater
than those of sensors containing fluorescein (3.94 × 104 and 2.10 × 104 M–1)13a and naphthalene (2.69 × 104 and 3.43 × 103 M–1),10a,13b whereas they are comparable to those of anthracene-tagged sensors
(8.08 × 104 and 7 × 104 M–1).10a,13c Also, the detection limit is greater than
those with pyrene (2.98 ppm)12- and naphthalene
(3.48 ppm)13b-based sensors, respectively.
The SV plots for TNP in both cases exhibit linearity at lower concentrations
and an upward bent curve at higher concentrations. The nonlinearity
observed can be attributed either to self-absorption or resonance
energy transfer processes.6e,6g,15 To further validate the mechanism relevant for this turn-off quenching,
the spectral overlap between the absorption spectra of various NEs
and emission spectra of the sensors was examined. It was observed
that the extent of overlap is more between the emission spectrum of 1 and 2 with the absorption band of TNP compared
to other NEs, as shown in Figure 5. It is noteworthy to observe a larger extent of overlap
for 1 than 2. This was further proved by
calculating the overlap integral J(λ) values
by using the equation given below  where FD(λ)
= corrected fluorescence intensity of the donor in the range of λ
to λ + Δλ with the total intensity normalized to
unity and εA = extinction coefficient of the acceptor
at λ in M–1 cm–1.6e,16 For the TNP analyte, the overlap integral values were calculated
(based on the area from an overlap between the start of an emission
curve of the sensor and the end of the absorption curve of TNP) to
be 2.30 × 1014 (1) and 1.24 × 1014 (2). This confirms that more resonance energy
transfer takes place in 1 compared to 2.
This is also reflected in the SV plot where a stronger interaction
is observed for 1.

NEs in (a) 1 and (b) 2. Insets: Cuvette
images of 1 and 2 before and after the addition

TNP upon UV light illumination (λ = 365 nm).

spectra of 1 and 2.

Furthermore, the effective quenching response was more prompted
in case of nitrophenol derivatives, which is in accordance with the
acidity of the phenolic protons: TNP > 2,4-DNP > 4-NP. A decrease
in the quenching efficiency with the reduction in the acidity can
also be ascribed to the presence of Lewis basic pyridyl moieties where
the pyridyl nitrogen can form H-bonding interactions with the phenolic
protons of the nitrophenol derivatives, which are absent in the other
NE analytes.13b A probable mechanism for
the selective sensing of TNP from these observations has been illustrated
in Scheme 2, where
an energy transfer via π–π interactions between
TNP and anthracene or naphthalene moieties and the abovementioned
H-bonding with the more acidic phenolic proton of TNP play important
roles.

Scheme 2 Probable Mechanism for TNP Sensing by 1 and 2
In addition to these,
highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO–LUMO) energies of the sensors
and NEs were calculated using density functional theory with the basis
set B3LYP/6-31G+(dp) and the Gaussian 09 package program.17 The energy-optimized structures obtained for 1 and 2 are shown in Figure 6. The length of the methylene chain is 6.028
and 6.361 Å in 1 and 2, respectively,
which shows that because of more rigid and π-conjugated anthracene
moieties compared to naphthalene moieties, the chain gets squeezed
to stabilize the structure. On the other hand, the angles between
the anthracene moiety and the pyridyl group in 1 and
the naphthalene moiety and the pyridyl group in 2 (see Figure S32) are determined. On the basis of this
analysis, it is clear that the angle on one side is very similar (51.83°
and 52.72°, respectively) while the angle on the other side is
much different (71.99° and 88.54°, respectively) in 1 and 2. With this difference in angle between
the groups, there appears to be an impact of electronic and steric
effects on the interaction between 1 or 2 and TNP (and other analytes). With a wider angle in 2, it can be assumed that the access to both the naphthalene moiety
and the pyridyl group by the nitroanalytes is more than the corresponding
situation in 1. This affected the quenching % of 1 and 2 by the analytes. In general, the LUMO
of the nitroanalytes lie in between the conduction and valence band
of the sensor, resulting in photoinduced electron transfer (PET) to
the electron-deficient analytes. From these HOMO–LUMO energy
gaps (see Figure S33 and Table S2), it is inferred that PET takes place from the HOMO
of the sensor to the LUMO of electron-deficient TNP compared to other
NEs. This corroborates well with the observed maximum quenching efficiency
for TNP. However, when the quenching efficiency of other nitroanalytes
was compared with the corresponding spectral overlap integral values
(wherever possible) and LUMO energies, a similar trend was not observed.
This suggests that both PET and resonance energy transfer processes
interplay together for the observed quenching response.

structures of (a) 1 and (b) 2; (color code:
carbon, gray, but the carbon atoms of anthracene
and naphthalene are shown in orange and green colors, respectively
for clarity; nitrogen, blue; hydrogen, purple).

Also, the selectivity of TNP in the presence of other nitroanalyte
congeners was studied to analyze the competing effect of NEs. In such
an experiment, the fluorescence intensity of sensors (1 mg dispersed
in 2 mL of water) was recorded, followed by the 100 μL addition
of a particular nitroanalyte and then the 100 μL addition of
TNP (1 mM, water). This result vividly depicts insignificant change
in the intensity for other NEs while tremendous decrease in intensity
for TNP in the case of 1 (see Figure 7a), whereas for 2, in the presence
of 2,4-DNP and 4-NP, significant decrease was observed followed by
moderate change after the TNP addition. Thus, selectivity for TNP
is more in 1 than in 2 (see Figure 7a,b).

and after the addition of nitroanalytes

water, red bars represent the addition of various nitroanalytes to

(v) 1,3-DNB, and (vi) NB.

Both 1 and 2 were recovered for
the recyclability
test by centrifugation and washed several times with water after quenching
experiments. These were then utilized for quenching experiments of
TNP for up to five recycles to exhibit their quenching ability (see Figure S34). To study the hydrolytic and chemical
stability of 1 and 2, 12 mg of each sample
was soaked in 2 mL of water or aqueous solution of TNP (1 mM) for
3 days, filtered, and washed thoroughly with water for PXRD studies.
Comparing the PXRD patterns of the pristine and treated samples of 1 and 2, it is confirmed that their crystallinity
is intact because of such exposure (see Figure 8a,b). Furthermore, an analysis of surface
morphologies of both 1 and 2 by field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) indicates that there is no change
between before and after immersing in a 1 mM aqueous solution of TNP
(see Figure 8c). Thus, 1 and 2 can be used for the long term in-field
detection of highly explosive TNP.

and after immersing in water and aqueous TNP solution. (c) FESEM images
of 1 (i,ii) and 2 (iii,iv) before and after
soaking in 1 mM aqueous TNP solution, respectively.

Lifetime Measurements
On the basis
of the abovementioned
observation of deviation from linearity in the SV plot, which suggests
that there is an amalgamation of both static and dynamic quenching,
time-resolved lifetime measurements were recorded for 1 (Figure 9a) and 2 (Figure 9b) for further justification. In general, if the lifetime of the
sensor remains unchanged with the change in the concentration of the
analyte, the process is termed as static quenching.16 From the lifetime decay curves, the average lifetime for
both the sensors was calculated before and after the addition of TNP
(Table S3). For 1, average
lifetimes were 10.36 ns (before the TNP addition), 10.38 ns (after
the 20 μL TNP addition), 10.23 ns (after the 60 μL TNP
addition), and 10.11 ns (after the 200 μL TNP addition). On
the other hand, for 2, average lifetimes were found to
be 6.97 ns (before the TNP addition), 6.75 ns (after the 20 μL
TNP addition), 6.50 ns (after the 60 μL TNP addition), and 6.42
ns (after the 200 μL TNP addition). This corroborates well with
the aforementioned results, signifying that resonance energy transfer
is more dominant at higher concentrations of the analyte. The quenching
rate constant (Kq) values were also calculated
to be 5.58 × 1012 and 4.68 × 1012 M–1 s–1, respectively, for 1 and 2 using the following equation: Kq = KSV/τavg, where KSV is the quenching constant
and τavg is the average lifetime of the sensor.

after the TNP addition.

In-Field Detection of TNP
For fast and effective detection
of TNP, test strips were prepared using Whatman filter papers immersed
in aqueous suspensions of 1 and 2. These
coated paper strips showed blue emission under UV light at 365 nm.
Also, after adding a small quantity of an aqueous solution of each
NE as a spot, these paper strips displayed a distinguishable dark
color change for TNP only, as shown in Figure 10a,b. In the case of 1, more
darkened spots were depicted for TNP compared to those for 2. In 2, moderate darkening was also observed for 2,4-DNP
and 4-NP, further confirming more selectivity in 1. Furthermore,
a negligible change was observed for the rest of the NEs in both cases.
In addition to these, different concentrations of TNP were also added
(10 μL each, 10–8 to 10–3 M) to 1 and 2 (see Figure 10c,d), leading to a darkened color change
with an increase in the concentration of TNP after illumination with
UV light at 365 nm for visual and facile detection of TNP with naked
eye.

Conclusions
In conclusion, two new sensors 1 and 2 based on mixed bicyclic fused rings (anthracene
or naphthalene)
with pendant Lewis basic pyridyl groups have been designed and synthesized
via simple reduced Schiff base condensation reaction. Their bulk phase
purity and crystallinity were confirmed by PXRD. These sensors are
capable of detecting highly explosive TNP in water with detection
limits of 0.6 and 1.6 ppm, respectively. On the basis of the spectral
overlap between the absorption spectrum of TNP and the emission spectrum
of 1 or 2, resonance energy transfer plays
a dominant role in both cases with more overlap integral value in 1, resulting in more selectivity toward TNP compared to 2. Also, the competitive test demonstrated that 1 has more selectivity than 2 in the presence of different
commonly interfering NEs. The resonance energy transfer, PET, and
electrostatic interactions play key roles for the turn-off quenching
response for TNP in 1 and 2. Both were recyclable
for up to five recycles without much loss in sensitivity. Their stability
after sensing experiments was confirmed by PXRD and FESEM. For an
in-field detection, handy test paper strips coated with 1 or 2 also confirmed that these can be used for visual
detection of TNP for environmental monitoring. The present results
could provide a pathway for the development of different fluorescent
sensors with the incorporation of various recognition sites to end
up with increased sensing capabilities.

Experimental Section
Materials
and Methods
All chemicals for synthesis were
purchased commercially and used as received without further purification.
All reactions were carried out under aerobic conditions.

Caution! TNP and TNT are highly explosive in nature and
should be handled carefully and in small amounts. The explosives should
be handled as dilute solutions and with safety measures to avoid an
explosion.

Physical Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of the 1 and 2 ligands were
obtained in CDCl3 solution at 25 °C on a Bruker ARX-400
spectrometer. Chemical shifts are reported relative to the residual
solvent signals. FTIR spectra were measured in the 4000–400
cm–1 range on a PerkinElmer spectrum I spectrometer
with samples prepared as KBr pellets. The UV–vis spectra were
recorded using 1 mM solution on an Agilent Cary 6000 spectrometer.
Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was performed using
a Thermo Scientific LTQ XL LC–MS instrument for the 50–2000
amu range. PXRD data were recorded on a Rigaku Ultima IV diffractometer
equipped with 3 kW sealed-tube Cu Kα X-ray radiation (generator
power settings: 40 kV and 40 mA) and a D/tex Ultra detector using
the BB geometry over the angle range 5–50° with a scanning
speed of 2°/min with 0.02° step. (2.5° primary and
secondary solar slits and 0.5° divergence slit with 10 mm height
limit slit). The surface morphology of the as-prepared samples was
examined using FESEM (JEOL, 8 or 15 kV). Fluorescence spectra were
recorded using a HORIBA Jobin-Yvon fluorescence spectrophotometer
with stirring attachment. Lifetime measurements of 1 and 2 were carried out using the time-resolved HORIBA scientific
single photon counting controller.

(206 mg, 2 mmol) in a mixture of CH2Cl2/CH3OH (1:2 v/v, 6 mL) placed in a 10 mL RB flask, a methanolic
solution of 1,4-diaminobutane (0.1 mL, 1 mmol in 1 mL methanol) was
added dropwise with continuous stirring. The reaction mixture was
refluxed at 50 °C for 6 h, leading to the formation of a yellow
precipitate. An excess of NaBH4 (3 equiv, 114 mg) was added
portion-wise at 0 °C and stirred for 24 h at 30 °C to obtain
a clear yellow solution. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure,
washed with water, and extracted into a chloroform layer. To the organic
layer, anhydrous Na2SO4 was added and filtered,

Synthesis of N,N′-Bis(anthracen-9-ylmethyl)-N,N′-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine
(banthbpbn, 1)
In a 25 mL round-bottom
(RB) flask, 384.3 mg (0.82 mmol) of H2banthbn was added to 3 mL of water. To this solution,
269 mg (1.64 mmol) of 2-picolyl chloride dissolved in 2 mL of water
was added dropwise, followed
by the addition of 4 equiv NaOH (132 mg in 2 mL water) to maintain
the pH = 12. The resulting mixture was stirred for 24 h at 30 °C.
The desired product was extracted in the chloroform layer and obtained
as light yellow oily liquid by evaporating the solvent under reduced
pressure. The liquid was washed with diethyl ether to form a yellow

Synthesis of N,N′-Bis(naphthalen-1-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine
(H2bnaphbn)
This was prepared with a little modification reported in the literature
procedure.19 To a solution of 1-naphthalene
carboxaldehyde (0.303 mL, 2.2 mmol) dissolved in 6 mL CH2Cl2 placed in a 25 mL RB flask, 1,4-diaminobutane (0.11
mL, 1.1 mmol in 1 mL methanol) was added dropwise with continuous
stirring at 30 °C for 2 h. The solvent was evaporated to obtain
yellow oily liquid and suspended in 8 mL CH3OH. To this
abovementioned solution, an excess of NaBH4 (3 equiv, 125.4
mg) (acting as the reducing agent) was added portionwise at 0 °C
and stirred for 20 h at 30 °C. The solvent was evaporated under
reduced pressure and washed with water, and the product was extracted
into the chloroform layer. To the organic layer, anhydrous Na2SO4 was added and filtered, and the reduced Schiff
base was obtained in the oily form by evaporating the solvent under
reduced pressure. Yield: 375.7 mg (90%). 1H NMR (400 MHz,
CDCl3): δ 1.63 (t, 4H), 2.77 (t, 4H), 4.24 (s, 4H),

(bnaphbpbn, 2)
In a 25 mL RB flask,
375.7 mg (1.02 mmol) of H2bnaphbn was added to 3 mL of water. To this, 334.6 mg (2.04
mmol) of 2-picolyl chloride was added dropwise and dissolved in 2
mL water, followed by the addition of 4 equiv NaOH (164 mg in 2 mL
water) to maintain the pH = 12. The resulting mixture was stirred
for 24 h at 30 °C. The desired product was extracted in the chloroform
layer and obtained as an off-white solid by evaporating the solvent
under reduced pressure. Yield: 517 mg (92%). mp 143–145 °C. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.55 (t, 4H), 2.50

Fluorescence
Study for NEs
One milligram of finely
ground samples of 1 and 2 were weighed and
added to a fluorescence cuvette (path length of 1 cm) containing 2
mL of Milli-Q water under constant stirring. To the abovementioned
dispersed solution of the samples in water, NEs were added incrementally
from 1 mM stock solution (stock solutions of those without a phenolic
group were prepared in 9.5 mL water and 0.5 mL methanol), and the
corresponding photoluminescence spectral responses were monitored.

Preparation of the Test Paper Strip
A test paper strip
was prepared by coating the fluorescent samples on a Whatman filter
paper by immersing them into an aqueous suspension of the respective
samples and drying in air. These strips were used to detect nitroanalytes
by dropcasting a small volume of an aqueous solution of each of the
nitroanalytes (10 μL, 1 mM in water) onto the dried filter paper
strips coated with the samples.
