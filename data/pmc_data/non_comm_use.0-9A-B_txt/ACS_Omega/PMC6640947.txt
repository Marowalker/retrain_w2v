We present the physics
of sequential dewetting phenomenon and continuous
fabrication of a polymeric microstencil using dewetting phenomenon
with roll-to-roll imprinting equipment. To realize dewetting-assisted
residual-free imprinting, mold material, polymer resin, and substrate
were selected via interfacial surface energy analysis. In addition,
optimal parameters of the continuous process were also studied by
experimentally comparing the resultant shape of the microstencil depending
on the process speed, aspect ratio of the mold, and applied pressure.
As a result, the polymeric microstencil was produced continuously
in very high yields, and its maximum resolution reached 20 μm
in diameter. For an easy, continuous demolding during the roll-to-roll
process, the material chosen for the substrate film was paraffin-coated
film, which has the surface energy low enough for dewetting while
having a higher adhesion value than polydimethylsiloxane mold. This
versatile, high-throughput microstencil fabrication process can be
used in many applications requiring flexibility, scalability, and
specific material, and high productivity.

1 Introduction
Inspired
by the traditional stenciling, which prints letters or
images by applying pigment through a surface having designed cuts,
a microscale stencil process has been capitalized in diverse microfabrication
works ranging from patterned evaporation or etching to selective cell
culturing, mainly by using a thin membrane perforated with desired
micropatterns as a shadow mask.1−7 Preparation of such a microstencil has commonly relied on the photolithography
on a rigid Si wafer, accompanied by spin-coating of photoresist and
later through etching of Si.1,2 However, this conventional
wafer-by-wafer process is often unsuitable in broader and more practical
applications because of its limitations in area, fabrication speed,
and use of flexible substrates.

Alternatively, a soft lithography
in which a flexible mold directly
imprints a pattern on a UV-curable resin-coated substrate such as
polyurethane acrylate (PUA) under a conformal contact can be applied
to produce a desired microstencil pattern onto either flexible or
rigid substrates at high speed. PUA is the most appropriate UV-curable
material because of its small curing-induced shrinkage, mechanical
rigidity at high resolutions, flexibility for conformal contact, and
high light transmittance for UV curability.8 Although this imprinting-based approach is effective and potentially
more scalable, there usually remains a residual layer in the as-imprinted
resin pattern, which should be removed by additional etching process
to complete a perforated microstencil membrane. For that reason, minimizing
the thickness of the residual layer is highly desired. Studies on
the efforts to minimize the thickness were attempted by increasing
the imprinting pressure, yet this cannot be an eventual solution because
of the unwanted crumpling of the soft mold at excessive pressure.9,10

In particular, Kim et al. fabricated a new type of free-standing,
yet flexible polymeric membrane as a shadow mask for thermal evaporation
using PUA. PUA was drop-dispensed on a patterned polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) mold and covered with another flat PDMS mold. Pressure was
applied from the end of the flat PDMS mold to the other end using
a roller that squeezed out PUA between the two PDMS molds. Then, PUA
was cured by UV light through transparent PDMS molds for several minutes.
The PUA stencil was fabricated by detaching from the two PDMS molds.7 Also, Cho et al. reported a simple replication
method to fabricate a flexible free-standing polymeric membrane. They
used the fabrication method that involves spontaneous dewetting phenomenon
of a hydrophilic (hydrophobic), UV-curable resin against a hydrophobic
(hydrophilic) mold. Hydrophilic resins (PUA301, PUA311, and NOA73)
were used as a lower patterned mold and a flat upper mold to replicate
the hydrophobic perfluoropolyether resins. Each material can be exchanged
to obtain a free-standing polymeric membrane.11 Fabrication of a polymeric stencil with UV-curable materials is
relatively inexpensive and faster than that utilizing silicon wafer
or PDMS as the stencil material. These stencil fabrication methods,
however, have a limit on production efficiency because of manual fabrication.
Therefore, continuous fabrication studies for stencils made of UV-curable
materials are essential to utilize stencils in various fields. In
addition, it is required to develop a scalable, high-throughput methodology
to create flexible microstencils without applying high pressure and
additional etching process.

Addressing these issues in this
work, we ingeniously utilized the
dewetting phenomenon to change a thin liquid resin layer to a residual
layer-free perforated structure upon a conformal contact with a micropatterned
mold using the roll-to-roll process, realizing the direct stamping
of flexible perforated membranes at a moderate pressure without additional
etching procedure. The overall process is integrated in a continuous
roll-to-roll imprinting system to further improve the scalability
and throughput. Importantly, we analytically confirm that a successful
process can be conducted by controlling the substrate surface energy
to be low enough to result in good resin dewetting but higher than
that of a mold to ease demolding. Parametric effects of the roll-to-roll
stamping speed, stamping pressure, and the mold pattern geometry (i.e.,
pillar diameter and height) are systematically investigated to better
understand the principle and optimize the process for many application-specific
uses.

2 Results and Discussion
To derive dewetting
phenomenon from specific mold, substrate, and
resin materials, a thin layer of resin needs to be created between
the mold and the substrate. In this work, PDMS, paraffin-coated film
(PPF), and PUA were used as the mold, substrate, and UV-curable resin,
respectively. Specifically, for the fabrication of perforated microstencil,
the PUA resin between the top of each pillar of PDMS mold and underneath
the PPF substrate needs to be thin as shown in Figure 1a. The required thickness of resin can be
calculated by 1  where Aeff is
the effective Hamaker constant for the molecular-level interaction
of the thin resin layer with the contacted surfaces, γ is the
surface energy of the resin, and λ is the wavelength of the
thin layer. In this case, micropillars of PDMS mold act as a physical
barrier to express the half-cycle of waves, and λ can be considered
to be the pitch of the micropillars in mold. The effective Hamaker
constant for the PDMS/PUA/PPF combination is given by the mixing rule
combining individual Hamaker constants as follows12 2

microstencil when the resin is thin enough for dewetting.

From the literature, APPF = 0.93 ×
10–20 (J),13APDMS = 5.2 × 10–20 (J),14 and Aair = 0, such
that Aeff = 3.01 × 10–20 (J). The surface energy of uncured PUA is approximately 40 mJ/m2.11 Using eq 1 and the acquired variables, the required
thickness of the PUA resin for dewetting is estimated by t (nm) = 7.4 × λ1/2 (μm) and expressed
in Figure 1b in relation
to the pitch of the pillar in the mold. For instance, in the case
of the 100 μm periodic mold shown in Figure 3c, the PUA resin layer needs to be thinner
than 74 nm for the initiation of dewetting phenomenon. As shown in Figure 1b,c, very thin resin
layers can be fabricated continuously through sequential contact of
pillars by the roll-type patterning system. To fabricate thin resin
layers continuously, roll-to-roll patterning system is expected to
be a suitable candidate because the curvature of the roll mold leads
the line contact between mold and substrate. This gradual contact propagation
can produce very thin layers of resin continuously.

Figure 2 schematically
shows the overall process to continuously fabricate the flexible microstencils
through the roll-to-roll UV imprint lithography system. Here, a flexible
mold with a designed pillar array is fabricated using simple molding
(Figure 2a) and wrapped
around the roll that is used for continuous stamping of the counterprofiled
hole pattern on the UV-curable resin-coated flexible substrate as
rolling proceeds under a conformal contact (Figure 2b). By controlling the interfacial surface
energies at the mold–resin–substrate interfaces, the
dewetting of a liquid resin coating can be induced at the substrate
surface and can locally lead to the perforation of a resin layer where
it becomes particularly thin by contacting to the mold’s pillar
tips (Figure 1). In
other words, the liquid region engaged by the mold’s pillar tips becomes
thin enough to expose the underlying substrate surface by dewetting.
Additionally, this perforated resin structure can be smoothly demolded
from the mold after the UV curing and can be peeled off the substrate
to complete the microstencil fabrication.

Figure 2 Schematic illustration
of the roll-to-roll equipment for the fabrication
of microstencil. (a) Scheme for PDMS mold fabrication. (b) Scheme
for roll-to-roll equipment setup.

Figure 3 demonstrates the exemplary experimental
result of
the fabrication of the microstencil by following the above-described
procedure, where 133 μm-diameter holes are clearly perforated
on a 190 μm-thick resin film. The pillar mold successfully creates
perforated holes in the resin layer coated on the flexible substrate
in a continuous and high-speed manner in the roll-to-roll imprinting
system. Even relatively small size holes (20 μm in diameter)
have been fabricated as shown in Figure S1. Notably, the perforated resin layer cured by the UV light remains
on the substrate after it was released from the mold contact zone.
Here, we used PDMS, PUA, and a plastic PPF (i.e., Parafilm M, Bemis
Company, Inc.) for the mold, resin, and substrate materials, respectively.
The choice of these materials is essentially based on their surface
energies, which is essential to induce proper resin dewetting and
demolding at the mold–resin–substrate interfaces.

free-standing microstencil. (c) SEM image of the PDMS pillar mold.
(d) SEM image of the fabricated microstencil on PPF by continuous
process.

Such a proper choice of materials
can be analytically dictated
by calculating the spreading coefficient of a liquid resin at the
mold–resin–substrate interfaces, which can be determined
by the interfacial surface energies at mold–resin–substrate
interfaces based on the contact angle of the liquid resin for each
interface.15

We begin with an equilibrium
spreading coefficient S, given as16 3  where γij is the interfacial surface
energy between i and j, and the
subscripts S, M, and L refer to the substrate,
mold, and liquid (resin), respectively. If the spreading coefficient S is negative, the liquid will undergo dewetting between
the mold and the film.17 The interfacial
energy between two surfaces, for instance, γSM in
the case of the substrate–mold interface, can be obtained from
the geometric mean equation given as18,19 4  where
γS and γM are the surface energies
of the substrate and the mold, respectively,
which are the sum of the dispersion term γid and the polar
term γip for each surface. Here, after measuring the
contact angles (θ) of deionized water and methylene iodide for
each i, γid and γip can be obtained
from an equilibrium Owens–Wendt term given as20 5  

Table 1 shows the
measured contact angles at each surface. Putting these values to eq 5 and solving the simultaneous
equations, we can obtain γid, γip, and γi for the micropatterned PDMS mold and PPF substrate
as summarized in Table 2 along with the known values reported elsewhere.11,18,19 Putting these to eq 4 and calculating eq 3, we finally get the spreading coefficient
of −58.5 mJ/m2, confirming that our material system
generates adequate dewetting for perforating the PUA resin layer between
the PDMS mold and the PPF substrate.

PUA (cured)14	21.6	11.2	32.8	
Another important issue is that the cured PUA stencil should be
easily demolded from the PDMS mold but must remain well-attached to
the PPF substrate. This can also be analytically verified by comparing
the work of adhesion between the PDMS mold and the cured PUA and that
of the cured PUA and PPF. A work of adhesion can be calculated as
the harmonic mean equation given as18−20 6  

Putting the above-obtained surface energy values to eq 6, the work of adhesion
values for
the mold–resin and resin–substrate interfaces are calculated
to be 28.8 and 50.9 mJ/m2, respectively. These work of
adhesion values confirm that the UV-cured PUA microstencil structure
could remain on the PPF with stronger adhesion while released from
the PDMS mold during the roll-to-roll imprinting process.

Exploring the effects
of the imprinting (rolling) speed, imprinting
pressure, and mold geometry (pillar size and depth) on the dewetting-assisted
microstencil fabrication is crucial to further refine the principle
and optimize the process for diverse applications. We first investigate
how the rolling speed influences the process by conducting the fabrication
at different rolling speeds using the same mold under identical pressure. Figure 4 compares the two
experiments carried out at the different film moving speeds of 13.5
cm/min (Figure 4a,b)
and 22.5 cm/min (Figure 4c,d) under the imprinting pressure of 15 bar and using the same PDMS
pillar mold (50 μm diameter and 20 μm height). The scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images taken from these two cases evidently
disclose that a microstencil structure with well-penetrated holes
is fabricated at 13.5 cm/min while the holes are not fully perforated
at 22.5 cm/min. This demonstrates that a scalable microstencil fabrication
can be continuously conducted at a very high speed in a roll-to-roll
fashion compared with typical wafer-to-wafer processes, of cource,
but a sufficient time for contact before curing can allow to better
occur the dewetting of viscous liquid during the continuous imprinting.

(FE-SEM) images of the fabricated microstencil when the substrate
moving speed was 13.5 cm/min. (c,d) Top and tilted view FE-SEM images
of the fabricated microstencil when substrate moving speed was 22.5
cm/min.

Understanding the change in imprinted
resin layer thickness due
to varied imprinting pressures may lead to finding out the appropriate
condition for making perforated microstencil structures for the mold
used. In addition, we work on the systematic development of microstencils
having various hole sizes by applying different molds. Figure 5 shows the dewetting-assisted
imprinting results along with the resin layer thickness plot depending
on the imprinting pressure and aspect ratios. Here, we use the PDMS
micropillar mold with the aspect ratio in the range of 0–2,
and the feeding speed of the PPF is fixed to be 13.5 cm/min. The imprinting pressure denotes additionally applied pressure to
the ground condition where a mold-wrapped roll and a PPF make a conformal
contact by the tensioned film feeding. As the imprinting pressure
increases, the imprinted resin thickness reduces; at 10 bar, it reaches
125 μm, which is thinner than the 150 μm pillar height,
resulting in successful microstencil fabrication. It is worthy to
note that the pressure regime in this experimental space is much lower
than that in conventional imprinting processes especially aiming for
residual layer-free output,21 suggesting
that our process saves excessive pressure and thus undesirable mold
deformation attributed to the dewetting-assisted mechanism. Interestingly,
the relation between imprinting pressure and resin thickness is revealed
to be nonlinear as indicated in Figure 5; we believe that this is because in the thinner film
emerging at increased imprinting pressure, the dewetting effect becomes
more dominant to accelerate further thinning of the film. As the pillar
diameter decreases, the area of the pillar-contacting, thinned region
in the liquid resin layer becomes smaller, which may slightly confine
the dewetting phenomenon toward full perforation under identical processing
conditions. Also, the increased aspect ratio of pillars for the smaller
diameter cases may cause imperfect stamping because of bending, which
may be improved by tuning the process conditions and initial pillar
height.

The range of 0–2 for the aspect ratio and 2–10 bar shows
the imprint pressure for fabrication.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have presented
a continuous process method for fabricating
a microscale stencil pattern by a continuous roll-to-roll UV imprint
system using dewetting phenomenon. In addition, we analytically presented
that a successful process can be conducted by controlling the substrate
surface energy. PPF is used in this process as its surface area is
low enough to secure good resin dewetting while its adhesion value
is higher than that of a mold to ease demolding. Also, we demonstrate
parametric effects of the imprinting speed, imprinting pressure, and
aspect ratios of the pillar to better understand the principle and
optimize the process. Moreover, if a photomask pattern and UV-curable
resin are changed, various microstencils can be fabricated by this
method. The continuous roll-to-roll UV imprint system using dewetting
phenomenon can allow continuous, rapid, and cost-effective fabrication
of various microstencils. Therefore, it is expected that this fabrication
process can be extensively applied to various fields such as electronic
products and cell culturing.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Setup and Operation of the Roll-To-Roll Fabrication
System for Microstencil
Aluminum profiles are used in the
horizontal and vertical axes for fixing the imprint roll and rails
(SMR-18, Namiru optical apparatus) that can adjust the position of
the imprint roll. PPF is passed through the lower part of the central
imprinting roll with a diameter of 100 mm from the drive roll with
motor to a roll covered with PPF. Two idler rolls with a diameter
of 60 mm (RORMCS40-15-L100, Misumi Korea) are fixed to the same height
in the coating part for maintaining a tight tension of PPF when PPF
is wound by driving roller, and then it makes possible to coat the
UV-curable resin on a PPF uniformly. The linear UV LED (SUV-L125016A,
UVSMT) that is capable of adjusting the intensity at the maximum value
of 1600 mW/cm2 at a 365 nm wavelength is equipped under
the imprint roll. The linear UV LED of this roll-to-roll process has
a short time to irradiate the imprint part because the film is moved
at a constant speed. The UV intensity is fixed at 480 mW/cm2. In the demolding part, the drive roll on the left side is mounted
at the stepping motor with a minimum rotation speed of 6 rpm (PKE543AC-TS20,
Oriental motor). The decelerator with a 1:20 reduction gear for the
regulation of relatively low driving speed is attached to the stepping
motor.

4.2 Fabrication of Master Mold Using Photolithography
We fabricated the master mold using two methods. First, to apply
the SU-8 (2050) that had a thickness of 40 μm on a silicon wafer,
a thin layer of photoresist is spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s, followed
by soft baking at 65 °C for 3 min and then 95 °C for 6 min
on a hot plate because of removal a solvent of photoresist. An
FCG (film covered glass) mask of dotted pattern with diameters of
25 and 50 μm is equipped in the UV exposure machine (Mask aligner,
CA60TS); a thin layer of photoresist is exposed to an ultraviolet
radiation with 155 mJ/cm2. To make a strong bond between cross-linking polymer in the photoresist,
a post baking was performed at 65 °C for 1 min and 95 °C
for 6 min on a hot plate. After the post-exposure bake, the wafer is developed in an SU-8
developer for 5 min, followed by rinsing with isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
for approximately 10 s and then drying with nitrogen gas. Second,
to apply a photoresist having a thickness of 150 μm on a silicon
wafer, we changed the process condition appropriately. Finally, master
molds having the thickness of 40 and 150 μm with microholes
were fabricated. The patterned master mold is silanized by fluorinated
silane to facilitate the demolding of PDMS from the mold. The fluorinated
silane is sprayed on the patterned master mold and then vaporized
at 120 °C for 40 min. The fluorinated silane involves antiadhesive
properties that can control the surface energy between PDMS and the
master mold.22

4.3 Fabrication
of Soft Mold Using PDMS
The soft mold with the micropillar
should be equipped on the imprint
roll with a curved surface and should not be deformed easily because
of the imprint force between imprint roll and substrate. In this study,
soft mold is fabricated by PDMS (Sylgard 184 kit, Dow Corning), is
chemically stable, durable, and flexible. PDMS prepolymer made of
a mixture of a silicone elastomer base and a curing agent at a 10:1
ratio is coated on silicone master mold thinly and uniformly, followed
by degassing to remove bubbles generated during the inflow of air
while mixing PDMS prepolymer in a vacuum desiccator for 30 min. Then, it is cured by heat at 70 °C for 60 min in an oven,
and finally, the cured PDMS mold is released from the master mold.

4.4 Fabrication of PUA Microstencil
PUA
as a UV-curable resin is composed of oligomer, monomer, and photoinitiator.
Oligomer influences the physical property of the resin, and it forms
a thin cured membrane through the polymerization reaction. Oligomer is component of a cured membrane and forms polymer bonds
by the polymerization reaction in influencing components of the physical
properties of the resin. Monomer, the cross-linking agent of reactive
oligomer, is a raw material in the formation of a cured film through
polymerization. A photoinitiator that absorbs ultraviolet to generate
a radical or cation is a raw material to initiate polymerization.
When UV curable resin is exposed to UV light, a photo-initiator in
resin is excited by UV energy. The excited photoinitiator photopolymerizes
an oligomer in a short time; it completes the polymerization reaction
that is photopolymerized continuously to monomer and oligomer as the
main component of UV-curable resin. Di- or triacyrlated cycloaliphatic
urethane oligomer is used as the prepolymer for PUA. In addition,
1-hydroxy-cyclohexyl-phenyl-ketone or 2-hydro-2-methyl-1-phenyl-1-propane
is used as the photoinitiator.8,23 In this study, PUA
(MINS-311RM, Minuta Tech), which has high curing speed and excellent
physical properties, is used as the UV-curable resin for the fabrication
of polymeric microstencil. Also, PUA is capable of self-replicating
each other and shows a smooth demolding and pattern transfer below
a height of scores of micrometers. PUA is coated between PPF (Parafilm
M, Bemis Company, Inc.) as a substrate and a patterned PDMS mold and
will generate dewetting phenomenon when sufficient pressure is applied.
Then, PUA resin between a tip of the PDMS pillar and the flat mold
flows to side wall part of pillars by dewetting phenomenon, and a
residual layer free area can be induced. As previously stated, the
fabrication of a polymeric microstencil with UV-curable resin using
dewetting phenomenon is the process in which UV-curable resin is pressurized
for approximately 1 min between the patterned mold and a substrate
such as a flat PDMS mold. However, these conventional fabrication
methods have the practical limitation that the substrate cannot be
supplied consecutively. To utilize the polymeric microstencil fabricated
by continuous roll process easily, polymeric microstencil must be
demolded off the substrate film. PPF can be used in roll-to-roll continuous
fabrication process as a substrate film.
