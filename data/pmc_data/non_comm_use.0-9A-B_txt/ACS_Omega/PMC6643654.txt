A simple
yet effective methodology to obtain high-quality reduced
graphene oxide (RGO) using a tetrahydrofuran suspension of GO under
hydrogen at moderate pressure has been demonstrated. The extent of
reduction as a function of the pressure of hydrogen gas, temperature,
and time was studied, where the abstraction of oxygen is achievable
with least mutilation of C-sp2 bonds, hence upholding the
integrity of the graphene sheet. Herein, the formation of a short-lived
species is proposed, which is possibly responsible for such reduction.
A detailed theoretical calculation along with in situ UV–visible
experiments reveals the existence of a transient solvated electron
species in the reaction medium. The hydrogen RGO (HRGO) achieved a
C/O atomic ratio of 11.3. The conductivity measurements show that
HRGO reached as high as 934 S/m, which indicates a high quality of
RGO. The process is hassle-free, environmentally benign, and can be
scaled up effortlessly without compromising the quality of the material.

1 Introduction
Reduced
graphene oxide (RGO) is one of the most intensively studied
derivatives of graphene.1−3 Ever since the extraordinary properties
of graphene (e.g., mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical properties
as well as their high specific surface areas) were discovered, graphene
and its derivatives have been at the forefront of material research
till today.4,5 RGO is one of the most promising materials
used instead of graphene. The most common route used for the mass
production of graphene is to reduce GO chemically into RGO. The process
is well suited to versatile chemical functionalization and involves
low material cost. Simplicity and suitability for large-scale production
are among the few strong reasons for extensive use of this method.6,7 The challenges associated with the chemical route were inadequate
reduction, nonreproducibility, and formation of undesired defects.
Till date, the chemical reduction of GO has been performed with several
reducing agents such as NaBH4,8 hydrazine and its derivatives,9,10 hydroquinone,11 hydriodic acid (HI),12,13 sulfur-containing compounds,14 metal
powders,15 and so forth. Among them, metal
powders are the most powerful reducing agents achieving a high C/O
atomic ratio of RGO. Nascent hydrogen, which is considered to be especially
reactive and produced from the reaction of metals, such as Mg, Al,
Fe, and Zn, with an acid or amphoteric metals (Al and Zn) and their
alloys with the alkali solution, has been used by many groups for
the reduction of GO.16−19 However, achieving a high C/O ratio does not ensure a better quality
RGO.20

Herein, we have explored a
new synthetic methodology and its mechanistic
insights, which can reroute the procedure for the bulk production
of RGO. Instances of mere diatomic hydrogen for the reduction of GO
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) without a metal catalyst would be a new addition
to the literature. Herein, we report a simple methodology to synthesize
RGO under hydrogen in THF, which can be scaled up effortlessly without
compromising the quality of the product. The procedure involves exposure
of GO suspension in THF, to diatomic hydrogen at a moderate pressure
and temperature. The extent of reduction reaches a maximum at a pressure
of 40 bars at 180 °C. The reaction is carried out in a stainless
steel pressure vessel, resulting in excellent quality RGO. The method
of extraction is very facile and imparts zero impurity, and hence,
no purification is needed after reduction. The hydrogen RGO (HRGO)
using hydrogen achieves a C/O atomic ratio higher than 11.3 and the ID/IG ratio obtained
higher than 1.6. It should be noted that a controlled experiment was
carried out in the presence of argon keeping other reaction parameters
intact. GO used in the reaction was not reduced under argon, confirming
the role of hydrogen in such reduction (see Supporting Information S1). A detailed theoretical calculation reveals
the possibility of formation of solvated electrons in such reaction,
which is shown for the first time.

2 Results
and Discussion
The progress of reduction of GO using diatomic
hydrogen was monitored
using UV–visible absorption, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR),
and Raman measurements (Figure 1) as a function of time. GO shows an absorption maximum at
230 nm owing to the π–π* transitions of the aromatic
C=C bonds along with a weak shoulder at 303 nm due to n−π*
transitions of C=O bonds. A red shift of the characteristic
peak at 270 nm was observed for C=C, once the reduction is
over.21 During the process of reduction,
the optical absorption of RGO should have had increased as the intensity
of UV–visible spectra is directly proportional to the concentration
of the solute. However, owing to the hydrophobic nature of RGO, the
intensity decreases as it shows minimum amount which can form a stable
dispersion of RGO in water (Figure 1A).

Figure 1 (A) “a” shows the UV–vis spectrum
of GO, whereas
and “b, c, and d” correspond to RGO at 30 min, RGO at
60 min, and RGO at 120 min formed in the reaction, respectively. (B)

of the reaction. (C) Raman spectra of GO and RGO at 60 min reduction
and RGO at 120 min reduction, respectively. (D) TGA profile of GO,
RGO@20 bar of H2 (HRGO_1), and RGO @ 40 bar of H2 (HRGO_2).

For all the FTIR and
Raman measurements, shown in Figure 1B,C, reduction of GO was performed
at 40 bar of H2 pressure. The peak (Figure 1B) showing oxygen functionality almost vanishes
with time and a new peak generates at around 1578 cm–1 for the formation of C=C bonds. The degree of removal of
oxygen functionalities of GO at different intervals of time can be
observed in the plots shown below (Figure 1B). The peak intensities corresponding to
O–H stretching (3400 cm–1) and the vibrations
for O–H deformation (1410 cm–1) were decreased
gradually. The peak intensities corresponding to the stretching of
oxygen functionalities such as >C=O (1720 cm–1), epoxy >C–O (1226 cm–1), carboxylic
>C–O
(1320–1210 cm–1), and alkoxy C–O (1050
cm–1) were also observed to decrease during the
progress of the reaction, whereas C=C stretching vibration
peaks for pristine GO were detected at ca. 1600 cm–1, which is shifted to 1578 cm–1 for RGOs as reported
by Fang et al.

The Raman spectra showing the D band and G band
of GO were shifted
to 1336 cm–1 and 1571 cm–1, respectively,
after the reduction. The intensity ratio of the D and G bands, ID/IG, increases
with time as depicted in Figure 1C. Such enhancement in the intensity ratio is attributed
to the increased sp2 domains in the system.22

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Figure 1D) did not show any
significant weight loss
for GO and RGO near 100 °C, as the samples were dried before
measurements to eliminate the influence of absorbed moisture on the
results. GO unveils a two-step downdrift; the first step starting
at 175 °C owing to the loss of hydroxyl, epoxy functional groups,
and remaining H2O molecules. The second step involves a
decline in the range of 450–550 °C, which involves the
pyrolysis of the remaining oxygen-containing groups and the burning
of ring carbon. RGO shows a weight loss of only about 7–9 wt%
at 250 °C, which is much lower than that of GO, indicating a
significant decrease in the amount of oxygenated functional groups.21 The height profile of RGO using atomic force
microscopy (AFM) (Figure 2A) shows the thickness of the RGO sheet to be 1.05 nm, revealing
that the sheet has a single layer of RGO and is consistent with the
previous literature reports. The conductivity for GO was found to
be 0.04 S/m and the same for RGO was 934 S/m, which validate the claim
regarding the quality of HRGO obtained using the aforementioned technique
(Figure 2B).

showing the height profile of HRGO. (B) IV plots
of (----) GO and (----) HRGO samples. XPS
spectra of (C) GO and (D) HRGO.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was carried
out
to provide direct evidence of reduction through the removal of oxygen
functionality in GO. The C/O ratio of GO was calculated by taking
the ratio of peak areas of C 1s to O 1s in XPS spectra (see Supporting Information S.8.) increased from 2.5
to 11.3 after the reduction. The raw data of carbon 1s XPS spectrum
of GO was deconvoluted into four peaks, which were assigned to four
types of carbon (as shown in Figure 2C), with different chemical valences, including nonoxygenated
ring carbon, C–C (284.8 eV), carbon in C–OH (286.5 eV),
C–O–C (287.4 eV), and O–C=O (288.9 eV),
respectively. After reduction, the decrease in the intensity of all
C 1s peaks corresponding to the oxygenated carbon and the corresponding
increase in the intensity of sp2 carbon reconfirm the efficacy
of this methodology in restoring the conjugated graphene network and
removal of functional groups (Figure 2D).

Capacitive behavior of as-synthesized HRGO
samples was evaluated
using several electrochemical measurements. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
measurements were done in the potential window of 0–1 V, at
various scan rates as shown in Figure 3A. Capacitive performance was indicated by an increase
in current response with increasing scan rate. The galvanostatic charge–discharge
(GCD) curve at various current densities is shown in Figure 3B. Charge–discharge
curves are almost symmetrical in nature, indicating the contribution
of both double-layer capacitance and pseudocapacitance. At a current
density of 0.5 A/g, HRGO showed a capacitance of 179 F/g. As the current
density increases to 6 A/g, the HRGO retains only 48% of initial capacitance
(Figure 3B inset),
which is due to low penetration of ions in the inner pore induced
by the fast potential changes.23 In general,
the capacitance is primarily proportional to the surface area of the
electrode materials. Graphene has a very high electrical conductivity
and an exceptionally large specific surface area (theoretical value,
∼2650 m2/g).24 It was
reported that such a high theoretical surface area can provide a gravimetric
capacitance of a supercapacitor (SC) as high as 550 F/g.25 Despite this promising interpretation, when
prepared in the form of RGO using established solution processes (via
Hummer’s method), typical graphene SCs exhibit only 100 to
120 F/g in organic electrolytes26 and around
135 F/g with aqueous electrolytes.27 These
smaller specific capacitances are attributed to irreversible restacking
of the individual RGO sheets during the reduction and drying processes.28 Graphene SCs are largely dependent on the detailed
characteristics of graphene such as its functional groups, size, pore
structure, and surface accessibility.29 Lack of porosity in RGO makes substantial surfaces unavailable for
charge storage. Nyquist plots at various amplitudes are shown in Figure 3C. The plot exhibited
two distinct regions, that is, a semicircle in the high-frequency
region and a slope line in the low-frequency region. Appropriate fitting of the obtained electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
spectra with the equivalent circuit diagram is shown in the inset,
and the charge transfer resistance appears to be 7 Ω, which
reveals superior quality of HRGO. Furthermore, the cyclic rate performance
of specific capacitance from charge–discharge measurements
was evaluated. At a current density of 6 A/g, HRGO retained 93% of
capacitance after 2000 cycles as shown in Figure 3D. The GCD curves are almost symmetrical
in shape even after prolonged cycling as depicted in the inset (Figure 3D).

scan rates and (B) GCD curves at various
charge densities, inset showing the variation of specific capacitance

part and equivalent circuit diagram used for fitting EIS. (D) Cyclic
stability of HRGO at a current density of 6 A/g, inset showing corresponding

A two-way approach was attempted to understand and detect
the reactive
intermediate responsible for such GO to RGO reduction. The first approach
involved the use of a probe substrate in the same reaction condition.
The second approach was to monitor the reaction
mixture during the progress of the reaction using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer connected to the reactor (experimental details are
shown in Supporting Information S2) (see Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Formation of Solvated
Electrons in THF under the Reaction Conditions
Resulting from the Reduction of GO to HRGO
In the first study, styrene oxide was used as the probe
substrate
in the same reaction condition to see the fate of the epoxide functionality
that actually exists in the graphitic lattice of GO. Interestingly,
peaks of all the products are clearly visible in the spectra obtained
from gas chromatography (GC) and GC–mass spectrometry and are
very much aligned with the products formed using traditional reducing
agents reported in the previous literature30 (see Supporting Information S3). This
evidence strongly supports the possibility of the formation of a transient
reducing species responsible for such reaction. A possible mechanism
for such reduction is shown in Scheme 2. Kindly note that the reactive intermediate proposed
in the reaction involving the probe substrate is purely based on the
products obtained, and no claim has been made on the proof of formation
of the organic reactive intermediate.

Scheme 2 Proposed Mechanism
Using a Probe Substrate (Styrene Oxide) Revealing
the Possibility of the Formation of an Intermediate Species Generated
during the Reaction
The reduction of THF-suspended GO at high (H2) pressure
indicates the formation of H+ + e– from
H2, which might lead to the formation of solvated electron
in THF. The role of THF in
these reactions is extremely significant. An important structural
aspect of THF is that it is a polar molecule which, we believe, may
induce polarity in hydrogen molecules at that temperature and pressure.

Apprehending the possibilities of the formation of such species,
a DFT calculation directly correlating with the experimental results
were performed to evaluate the electronic structure and properties
of solvated electrons for anionic, solvated, and neutral form of THF.
We hypothesized that the transient species is the solvated
electron in THF. In the presence of suspended GO in THF at
high pressure, H2 generates H+ and e–. The generated e– undergoes through a different
nonequilibrium relaxation process. It could reduce neutral THF to
[THF]−. The other possibility is that the generated
electron could be solvated by THF solvent molecules. Here, we would
like to emphasize that the electron is a fundamental quantum particle
and thus any classical picture of solvation (e.g., ions solvated in
water) will certainly not hold. Rather, it is an additional electron
that loosely bounds with multiple THF molecules and none of these
solvent (THF) molecules that form the solvation shell can have exclusive
access to that additional electron. Such special sharing of an electron
between the THF molecules provides additional stability to be detected
as the transient species. We speculate that over the time period,
such a solvation picture starts to diminish as the one that THF molecules
start to get the exclusive access of the electron and turns into [THF]− (anion) from the solvated electron [e–]·[THF]n picture.

As a proof
of concept, we have investigated the single anionic
dimer, that is, [e–]·[THF]2, that
clearly indicated that the additional electron gets trapped between
the two [THF] species as the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
is localized in between the spatial region (see Figure 4). The time-dependent (TD)-DFT spectra also
confirm a prominent peak at 262 nm that is originated from HOMO to
lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) + 16 (52%) electronic transition
(shown in the Supporting Information, Table S3). This commensurate with the transient peak observed in the experiments.
We further observed that the neutral THF and anionic [THF]− have dipole moments opposite to each other (see Figure 4). Thus, the solvent dynamics
will play a crucial role in stabilizing the “solvated electron”;
however, the detailed studies of dynamics are in the process and will
be communicated soon.

Figure 4 Calculated dipole moments for THF and [THF]− that
orient opposite to each other are shown in the left panel along with
the corresponding HOMOs. In the right panel, the HOMO for [e–]·[THF]2 indicates that the additional electrons
do not reside within the molecules itself. However, it localizes in
a space enclosed by the two THF species. This entrapment of the electron
in the space could be visualized as the solvation of electron rather
than the anionic form in cases of THF.

3 Conclusions
Herein, we have developed a new
environment-friendly synthetic
methodology to effectively reduce GO using molecular hydrogen at a
moderate pressure and temperature. Mechanistic studies with a two-way
approach, along with theoretical analysis, reveal the possibility
of the formation of a transient species, hypothesized as “solvated
electron”. The RGO so formed has achieved a C/O atomic ratio
greater than 11.3 and a bulk electrical conductivity of as high as
934 S m–1. The combination of XPS and TGA analyses
suggested that most of the labile oxygen functional groups were removed
during hydrogen reduction. Compared to other methods using reducing
agents, such as hydrazine, NaBH4, HI, and so forth, this
process is less time consuming and hassle free as postpurification
of the product is not required. There is a huge possibility to explore
and optimize the procedure for industrial applications.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Major
chemicals such as
THF, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), potassium permanganate
(KMnO4), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and
hydrochloric acid were purchased from Merck Chemicals unless mentioned
otherwise and used as received without further purification. Graphite
powder (<20 μm) was purchased from Sigma Aldrich.

4.2 GO Synthesis
GO was synthesized using
an improved method as reported in the previous literature.31 Reduction of GO was carried out in a pressure
reactor autoclave using hydrogen gas under various pressures and temperatures
to optimize the reaction condition. In brief, 50 mg of GO was dispersed
in 35 mL of THF. The above dispersion was then transferred to a 50
mL reactor vessel equipped with pressure and temperature sensors and
heated to 180 °C under H2 (40 bar) for 2 h. The obtained
reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 7000 rpm and washed with
distilled water and acetone. The dispersion was then filtered using
0.47 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene) membrane, and the resulting
solid was vacuum dried for 24 h and characterized further.

4.3 Characterization
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) of the resulting GO and RGO was carried out with Bruker Eco
D8 advance with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056 Å; see Supporting Information S5); morphological studies
and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area analysis
are shown in Supporting Information S6 and S7, respectively; UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded using
a UV-2600 spectrophotometer (Shimadzu); TGA (Figure 1D) was carried using STA-8000 (Perkin Elmer)
under nitrogen atmosphere at a scan rate of 5 °C/min. AFM was
performed with a Bruker Multimode 8 AFM using taping mode; XPS (EscaLab:
220-IXL) measurements were performed with a Mg-Kα nonmonochromated
X-ray beam having a photon energy of 1253.6 eV (chamber pressure 6
5 · 10 10 torr, Supporting Information S8). The progress of reactions was monitored using a Carry 660 FTIR
spectrometer and a WITEC Raman spectrometer with a 532 nm laser.

4.4 Measurements
Electrochemical measurements
were carried out with an Autolab multichannel PGSTAT 204M electrochemical
workstation using a three-electrode configuration involving platinum
and Ag/AgCl as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. A glassy
carbon electrode (3 mm diameter) coated with HRGO ink was used as
a working electrode. A homogeneous ink was prepared by dispersing
HRGO in dimethylformamide (1 mg/mL) by ultrasonication for 2 hours
and 10 μL of the above ink was drop cast on the glassy carbon
electrode. It was vacuum dried and 5 μL of 5% Nafion solution
was drop cast on the electrode surface, followed by further drying
for 12 h. CV measurements were done in the potential window of (0
to 1 V) at various scan rates. GCD tests were also done in a similar
potential window at various current densities ranging from 0.5, 1,
2, 4, and 6 A/g. All the measurements were done in an Argon purged
system containing 1 M Na2SO4 as an electrolyte.
The specific capacitance, C (F g–1), of the electrode material was calculated from the following equation:  where I (A) is the
discharge
current, Δt is the discharge time, ΔV is the potential window, and m (g) is
the active mass. EIS was performed over a frequency range from 0.01
Hz to 100 kHz at an open-circuit potential with an ac perturbation
of 5 mV.

4.5 Computation Details
DFT-based AIMD
simulations were performed at a finite pressure and temperature (1
atm & 400 K), and a 1 ps AIMD trajectory was generated to investigate
the formation of the transient species. The molecular geometries were
optimized using a hybrid B3LYP functional and def2-TZVP basis sets.
The TD-DFT calculations were performed to obtain electronic spectra
by applying a long-range correlation including a hybrid exchange–correlation
functional using the Coulomb-attenuating (CAM-B3LYP) method.32 An implicit solvation model such as the conductor-like
polarizable continuum model was also adopted to incorporate the solvation
effect in electronic spectra calculations (see Supporting Information S4). All the calculations were performed
using VASP and ORCA quantum chemical codes.33
