A highly exothermic nitrogen generation system (NGS)
can be achieved
by mixing solutions of sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride, a process
used by the oil and gas industry to dissolve paraffin wax and gas
hydrates. Although its main products are nitrogen gas and a sodium
chloride brine, the NGS has a side reaction that produces nitrogen
oxides. To optimize this process to ensure the greatest and fastest
heat generation with the lowest oxide production, this reaction was
checked by infrared spectroscopy and calorimetry. The factors temperature,
pH, and initial concentration of nitrite and ammonium were evaluated,
and the optimal conditions of the NGS were determined by the constructed
models to predict heat and NOx generation.
These conditions were a ratio of ammonium/nitrite equal to 1 and a
catalyst concentration of 0.07 mol·L–1 (for
a case in which the temperature is 5 °C).

==== Body
1 Introduction
The reaction of ammonium
and nitrite ions produces a highly exothermic
in situ nitrogen generation system (NGS).1−3 When ammonium
chloride and sodium nitrite are used, this reaction is considered
“green” because nitrogen and sodium chloride are the
main products of the reaction (eq 1). 1  

Because of the high heat generation,
this reaction has been successfully
used as a method of fluidization of low melting point deposits in
the oil and gas industry.3−8 These deposits may cause a decrease in the oil flow or even blockage
of production lines.9,10

In wells in the Gulf of
Mexico, which produce oil with a high paraffin
content, it was possible to increase productivity by up to 10 times
with this method, a result that was not achieved with other remediation
methods, such as the use of solvents.1 In
Brazil, the technique has also been used several times, such as in
dewaxing operations in the Campos Basin,11 melting gas hydrates,7 or even dispersion
and fluidizing different types of organic deposits present in crude
oil storage tanks.8,12

One application of the
NGS was to eliminate a hydrate plug formed
in a subsea equipment that prevented it from functioning properly.
The heat generated around the body of this equipment was able to increase
its temperature and eliminate the hydrate.12−14 Because NGS
fluids were discharged to the seabed and to the atmosphere, it is
essential to assess the environmental aspects associated with the
use of this technique.

The NGS reaction begins as soon as the
solutions of sodium nitrite
and ammonium chloride are mixed. However, it is possible to control
the reaction rate by manipulating the pH of the medium: a solution
at pH 8.0 reacts very slowly compared to the other at pH 5.0.1 For several reasons, a rapid increase in the
temperature is desirable, so the pH decrease is mandatory.

The
reduction of pH, aimed at accelerating the NGS reaction, increases
the occurrence of an undesirable side reaction, which is the production
of nitrogen oxide, NOx = NO2 + NO (eqs 2 and 3). Nitrite solutions can produce NOx at pH values below 6.0, and the kinetic of NOx becomes even faster when the pH drops.15 2   3  

NOx has
numerous negative impacts on
human health and environmental balance (air quality, climate, and
ecosystem health).16 Although NO is less
harmful than NO2, nitrogen monoxide is unstable and reacts
readily with oxygen to form NO2 (eq 4), which is dangerous even at low concentrations.17 Exposure to nitrogen dioxide causes irritation
and may cause a predisposition to respiratory disease, weakening bronchopulmonary
structures and triggering acute lung injury.17,18 4  

Because of the possibility of conversion
to acids (eqs 5 and 6),
NOx is capable of greatly disrupting aquatic
ecosystems and may cause the biological death of water bodies, which
can also undergo eutrophication because of increased availability
of nitrogen.19 In turn, when these oxides
reach the atmosphere, they cause, directly or indirectly, environmental
problems such as photochemical smog, acid rain, and even global warming.20−25 5   6  

By considering the environmental issues
related to NOx and the lack of studies
on the balance between heat
and NOx production by the NGS process,
this work aims to perform a quantitative analysis of the NOx production and evaluate the most appropriate conditions
to ensure the greatest heat generation with the lowest oxide production.

The real-time monitoring of the NGS reaction,26 performed by measuring the nitrite and ammonium consumptions
using attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(ATR–FTIR), was used to evaluate the NOx generation. If no side reaction occurs, the ammonium concentration
should decrease at the same rate as the nitrite consumption. Therefore,
the comparison of the in-line monitoring of the reaction progress
by evaluating both nitrite and ammonium ions could shed light on the
understanding of how nitrogen oxide generation can be lowered in the
NGS process.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Materials
Solutions of sodium nitrite
and ammonium chloride were used in the concentrations of 8 and 4 mol
L–1, respectively, prepared with ultrapure water
(type I) of a Milli-Q apparatus (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).
Glacial acetic acid was used as a catalyst, and ammonium hydroxide
was used as the NOx absorbing solution.
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA)
and had an analytical grade.

2.2 Equipment
The experiments were carried
out in a Mettler Toledo RC1e calorimeter. The reactor connected to
the calorimeter was an HP60 double-walled vessel with a 1.8 L volume,
in which the temperature of the reactor contents was controlled by
varying the temperature of the fluid circulating in the vessel jacket.
Several accessories were attached in the reactor cover: a stirrer
shaft with a propeller stirrer, a Pt100 temperature sensor, and a
15 W calibration heater. The reaction vessel and all components were
produced in Hastelloy C22.

The real-time FTIR monitoring was
performed by a Mettler Toledo ReactIR 45m spectrometer, whose base
unit contained the Fourier transform mid-infrared source and a mercuric
cadmium telluride detector. A K6 (16 mm diameter) conduit contained
the optics that transfer the infrared light source from the base unit
to the probe in contact with the reaction mass. Measurements were
taken optically using a diamond sensor as the ATR element, where the
IR-beam is attenuated if there are regions of the IR spectrum where
the sample absorbs energy.

2.3 Method
Specific volumes of the standard
solutions of sodium nitrite and ammonium chloride were mixed in the
HP60 vessel so that the ratio between the final concentrations of
these species, [NH4+]/[NO2–], was as defined for each experiment, always totaling 0.6 L final
volume (Table 1). Thereafter,
the temperature of the medium and stirring (350 rpm) was maintained
at a constant level throughout the experiments.

Table 1 Volumes of the Standard Solutions
Employed in the Preparation of the NGS Reactions
[NH4+]/[NO2–]	ammonium chloride
(mL)	sodium nitrite (mL)	
0.50	300	300	
0.75	360	240	
1.00	400	200	
1.25	429	171	
1.50	450	150	
The ATR–FTIR spectra were collected in the
range of 4000–650
cm–1 with 8 cm–1 resolution during
all the reactions. The beginning of the reaction was considered the
moment when the catalyst was added. Finally, a specific volume of
the catalyst was added to the medium so that its final concentration
was as defined for each experiment. Data were collected for 11 h after
the catalyst addition.

In the direct quantification of NOx, these oxides were absorbed in 100 mL of
a 6 mol L–1 ammonium hydroxide solution during the
NGS reaction. Afterward,
excess of sodium hydroxide was added to this solution, which was heated
until the generation of ammonia vapors ended. Next, the acidity of
the solution was adjusted to pH ≈ 7, and its volume was adjusted
to 250 mL. This final solution was used as the titrant of a standard
solution of potassium permanganate to quantify the nitrogen oxides
absorbed.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Analytical Curves for Nitrite and Ammonium
Determination by ATR–FTIR
To follow ammonium and nitrite
consumption during NGS reactions, the mid-infrared spectra of these
ions in water at different concentrations of both ions were acquired.
A univariate calibration model that associates the area of the selected
peaks with their respective concentrations was performed. Figure 1 shows the wavenumber
ranges in which water, ammonium, and nitrite presented their main
absorption in the mid-infrared region.

Figure 1 Infrared absorption peaks
in water solvent. The peak areas of ammonium
and nitrite are highlighted.

To construct the analytical curves, the peak areas
in the region
of 1300–1100 cm–1 for nitrite and 1500–1410
cm–1 for ammonium were measured. Both absorption
ranges were normalized in relationship to the water absorption maximum
at 1641 cm–1. These curves were prepared from 17
solutions of each ion, as shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively. Both ions presented a
very good correlation between the FTIR absorption peak area and the
corresponding concentration.

Figure 2 Analytical curves for (a) ammonium and (b) nitrite
solutions obtained
at 5 °C by measuring the peak areas highlighted in Figure 1.

3.2 Real-Time Monitoring of the NGS Reaction with
ATR–FTIR and Calorimetry
The good fit between the
peak area and concentration expressed in the calibration curves allows
real-time following of the consumption of ammonium and nitrite in
the NGS reaction. If the reaction follows a stoichiometric ratio of
1:1 (eq 1), the decrease
of both concentrations should occur at the same rate.

However,
because there is a possibility of nitrite consumption by a side reaction
producing NOx (eqs 2 and 3), the observation
of a higher rate for the nitrite consumption in relationship to ammonium
may indicate this occurrence. Figure 3 shows an example of an NGS reaction in which this
behavior was observed.

Figure 3 Real-time ATR–FTIR monitoring of the NGS reaction
for the
following experimental conditions: temperature, 8.75 °C; [NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations,
2.67 mol L–1; catalyst [HAcO] concentration, 0.13
mol L–1. (a) 3D plot of the ATR–FTIR real-time
monitoring; (b) ammonium and nitrite concentration.

As expected, the water absorption was constant
during the entire
experiment, and the concentrations of ammonium and nitrite started
decreasing as soon as the catalyst, acetic acid, was added. It is
easy to see in the graph that the nitrite concentration decreased
faster than the ammonium, indicating the formation of NOx. The concentration of NOx produced in the NGS reaction, that is, the amount of gas produced
per volume of solution, was calculated using eq 7, in which the variation of the concentrations
of both ions was obtained from the data presented in Figure 3b. 7  

Figure 4 shows the
production of NOx and the consumption
of ammonium and nitrite from this experiment.

Figure 4 Production of NOx and ammonium and
nitrite consumption during the NGS reaction for the following conditions:
temperature, 8.75 °C; [NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations, 2.67 mol L–1; catalyst [HAcO] concentration, 0.13 mol L–1.

According to the data in Figure 4, the NOx production
reached
6.5% of the initial concentration of nitrite. This quantity of such
a harmful product should not be neglected for applications of the
NGS reaction in the topside and subsea environments, indicating the
need for a deeper evaluation of the reaction conditions that will
minimize NOx production.

Aiming
at validating the results presented in this work, the amount
of NOx produced in the NGS reactions was
also determined by absorbing the formed gas in an ammonium hydroxide
solution according to a methodology described in the literature.15 The method is based on the conversion of nitrogen
oxides to ammonium nitrite (eq 8). 8  

The amount of ammonium nitrite is proportional
to the nitrogen
oxides and can be quantitatively determined using the standard potassium
permanganate titration procedure.27 To
check if there was a significant difference between the NOx values obtained by titration and those obtained
by infrared spectroscopy, a paired t-test was carried
out in which the null hypothesis that there was no difference between
the experimental means obtained from the different techniques was
evaluated.

According to the results, there is an equivalence
between the two
techniques. Therefore, the hypothesis that there is no difference
between the NOx measurements for ATR–FTIR
and titration is valid. From now on, the amount of NOx produced will be accepted as equal to the difference
in nitrite and ammonium consumption measured by ATR–FTIR. Section
S1 of the Supporting Information presents
the experimental conditions (Table S1),
the NOx values obtained by titration and
ATR–FTIR, and statistical results of the t-test (Table S2).

By considering
that the heat released in the reaction is proportional
to the conversion of the reagents into products, the monitoring of
the heat flow by a reaction calorimeter should also reflect the yield
of the NGS reaction. Figure 5 presents the comparison of the heat measurement with the
consumption of the NGS reagents using FTIR. It should be noted that
the evaluation of the reaction yield by using nitrite consumption
showed a higher value than what was measured for ammonium or heat
flow, and this difference corresponds to the NOx formation.

Figure 5 Yield of the NGS reaction determined by heat flow calorimetry
and
ATR–FTIR. The experimental conditions of this experiment were
temperature, 8.75 °C; [NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations, 2.67 mol L–1; catalyst [HAcO] concentration, 0.13 mol L–1.

3.3 Preliminary Evaluation of the Reaction Conditions
in the Heat Generation and Nitrogen Oxide Production
3.3.1 Catalyst Concentration
The reaction
of ammonium and nitrite ions is acid-catalyzed, so the pH should exert
an influence on the release of heat in NGS reactions. Figure 6 shows the evaluation of the
effect of acetic acid concentration in the reaction yield measured
by calorimetry.

Figure 6 Effect of catalyst concentration in the (a) pH and (b)
reaction
kinetics. The experimental conditions of this experiment were temperature,
8.75 °C; [NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations, 2.67 mol L–1.

Prior to the addition of the catalyst (where pH
≈ 6.60),
the reaction does not occur. However, with its addition, the pH of
the medium drops abruptly, and the reaction begins. As expected, the
increase of catalyst concentration led to an increase in the kinetics
of heat release that, in turn, is proportional to the reaction yield.

As was already emphasized, a drawback of the NGS reaction is NOx production. Figure 7 presents the NOx formation for the same experiments presented in Figure 6. The increase in catalyst
amount led to an increase in the production of heat (Figure 6b), but this greatest heat
release caused an enormous increase in the production of NOx (Figure 7). Similar to what is observed for the reaction of ammonium
and nitrite ions, NOx generation is also
dependent on the acidity of the medium, which influences the concentration
of nitrous acid.

Figure 7 NOx production as a function
of catalyst
concentration. Experimental conditions: temperature, 8.75 °C;
[NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations, 2.67 mol L–1.

By manipulating only the pH of the medium through
adjustment of
the acetic acid concentration, it is possible to obtain a variety
of profiles of heat release and generation of oxides. The results
shown in Figures 6b
and 7 clearly indicate that the higher the
catalyst concentration (lower pH values), the higher the rate of heat
release and nitrogen oxide generation. Additions of lower amounts
of catalyst, in turn, decrease NOx generation,
while the release of heat also drops significantly, somewhat undesirably.

An alternative to achieve good calorimetric yields with lower NOx production is the addition of the catalyst
over time, a situation illustrated in Figure 8. When the catalyst is divided into two aliquots,
in which the second is added 2 h after the first, there is a greater
control of the pH of the medium: the second aliquot is added at a
point when the nitrite concentration is lower than the initial one,
which limits NOx generation.

Figure 8 Effect of the
distribution of the catalyst over time in the (a)
pH, (b) reaction kinetics, and (c) NOx production. The experimental conditions of these experiments were
temperature, 8.75 °C; [NH4+] and [NO2–] concentrations, 2.67 mol L–1; final catalyst [HAcO] concentration, 0.10 mol L–1. The orange experiment corresponds to the total addition of the
catalyst, while the purple experiment corresponds to the addition
of the same amount but in two different aliquots (the second half
was added 2 h after the first).

Conversely, the literal addition of the catalyst
sharply reduces
the pH in a condition in which the nitrite concentration is maximal,
which increases the production of nitrogen oxides. However, by adding
the catalyst stepwise, the generation of heat is delayed.

3.3.2 Initial Concentrations of Ammonium and Nitrite
The ratio between ammonium and nitrite concentrations (R = [NH4+]/[NO2–]) was evaluated on three different levels. Figure 9 presents the results.

Figure 9 (a) NGS yield curves
based on ammonium consumption and (b) NOx production. The experimental conditions
of these experiments were temperature, 5 °C; catalyst [HAcO]
concentration, 0.13 mol L–1.

A preliminary analysis of these curves indicates
that the nitrite
concentration has a greater influence on the heat generation than
the ammonium concentration. Thus, the experimental condition in which
the [NH4+]/[NO2–] ratio is 0.25 is the one in which the greatest and fastest heat
release occurs. However, because of the larger excess of nitrite,
the nitrogen oxide production reaches its highest percentage (Figure 9b).

On the
other hand, because the catalyst concentration was the same
for these experiments, it can be assumed that the lower generation
of oxides in the case [NH4+]/[NO2–] = 1.00 is due to the smallest amount of nitrite
in the medium and its faster consumption by the NGS, which limits
the availability of nitrous acid to decompose (see eq 3).

3.4 Design of Experiments (DoEs): Evaluating the
Effect of Different Reaction Conditions on the Production of Heat
and Nitrogen Oxides
Knowing that the catalyst amount and
[NH4+]/[NO2–] ratio
influence heat generation as well as production of nitrogen oxides,
it is advisable to investigate experimental conditions that favor
the production of nitrogen in detriment to the decomposition of nitrous
acid.

Essentially, the following must be emphasized:(a) The decrease of the [NH4+]/[NO2–] ratio increases
the rate of heat generation, but very small ratios limit heat production
and significantly increase NOx production.

(b) Increasing the catalyst
concentration
increases the rate of heat generation but significantly increases
NOx production. In contrast, the stepwise
addition of the catalyst can minimize NOx production, although retarding the generation of heat.

(c) Raising the temperature leads to speeding
up of the reaction kinetics. Would that cause an increase in NOx production?



Aiming to evaluate heat and NOx simultaneously,
a central composite experimental design28 was performed, whose factors and their levels are presented in Table 2. Regarding the factors,
the “partition” corresponds to the division of the total
catalyst amount into two aliquots, where the second half is added P hours after the first (this time is defined by the value
of this variable). This factor was included to evaluate the catalyst
distribution over time, which avoids a sharp drop in pH under conditions
of higher nitrite concentration.

Table 2 Factors, Their Levels, and the Responses
of the DoE Performed
factors	–2	–1	0	+1	+2	
R: [NH4+]/[NO2–]	0.50	0.75	1.00	1.25	1.50	
C: [HAcO] (mol L–1)	0.01	0.04	0.07	0.10	0.13	
T: temperature (°C)	1.25	5.00	8.75	12.50	16.25	
P: partition (h)	0.0	1.0	2.0	3.0	4.0	
responses	y1 = yield after 11 h	y2 = yield after 1.5 h	y3 = % NOx after 11 h	
The response y1 was measured
at the
end of 11 h of reaction, enough time to ensure that the reaction had
already ceased, allowing the maximum potential of heat generation
of the NGS (maximum yield) to be evaluated. It is also possible to
evaluate the rate of heat generation through the response y2: high values indicate a large release of heat
in short times.

The models were evaluated by multiple multivariate
linear regression,
in which a model was obtained for each of the three responses. The
models initially contained first- and second-order terms, with interactions
between variables and quadratic terms of each factor individually.
ANOVA was performed to analyze the generated models, and the least
contributing variables were eliminated by backward elimination with
α = 0.05. Section S2 of the Supporting Information presents details of the results. The final models for each response
are presented in eqs 9–11. 9   10   11  

For all responses, the influence of
temperature was complex; it
depends on the catalyst concentration and the ammonium/nitrite ratio
for the NOx generation (terms +0.92RT and +0.31CT in eq 11) and on the ammonium/nitrite ratio for the
reaction yield (terms −1.92RT in eq 9 and −0.93RT in eq 10). As for
the effect of the catalyst partition on the reaction yield, the absence
of this variable in the final model of y1 was observed (eq 9),
while it appeared in the final model of y2 (eq 10). This indicates
that by adding the catalyst at different times, there is a delay in
the release of heat, but the potential of heat generation is independent
of this factor and is achieved in sufficiently long periods. The partitioning
of the catalyst also seems to influence the NOx generation, in which the addition of the catalyst at different
times controls this side reaction.

A common condition of application
of NGS is that in which the temperature
is about 5 °C and the catalyst is added completely at the beginning
of the reaction. This scenario simulates conditions found in ultradeep
subsea applications, in which the NGS is used by the oil industries
to fluidize low melting point solids formed in equipment related to
subsea wells. For this scenario, Figure 10 indicates the response surfaces obtained
by the constructed models.

Figure 10 Response surfaces for (a) yield after 11 h,
(b) yield after 1.5
h, and (c) NOx generation for the case
in which the temperature is 5 °C and the catalyst is added fully
at the start of the reaction.

The reaction conditions that converge for a rapid
and large heat
release (e.g., R = ±2 and C = +2) also lead to a higher generation of nitrogen oxides. Thus,
each response has a combination of factor levels that optimizes its
value. Table 3 lists
these combinations.

Table 3 Combinations of Factor Levels That
Optimize Each Response
effects	R	C	T	P	y1 (%)	y2 (%)	y3 (%)	
maximizes y1	2	1	–1	–2	85.2	38.3	12.3	
maximizes y2	2	2	–1	–2	81.9	40.6	12.7	
minimizes y3	0	–2	–1	–2	16.5	–2.6	1.32	
To maximize the overall reaction yield, using an excess
of the
reagents can lead to a yield of over 80% but with a NOx generation of over 10%. It should be noted that
even though the model’s global maximum is for R = +2 (excess of NH4+), using R = −2 (excess of NO2−) achieves
basically the same results. This can be seen in Figure 10a by the symmetry of the surface
curve over the R variable.

Minimizing NOx generation, on the other
hand, requires the minimum amount of the catalyst added to solution,
with an equivalent concentration of ammonium and nitrite. This condition
can decrease the amount of NOx generated
in around 90%, with a final NOx yield
of 1.32%. However, the overall NGS reaction also has a decrease in
its yield, going from 84.6 to 16.5%. This means that decreasing the
amount of generated NOx also leads to
less generated heat. Because the level of one factor can improve one
response and worsen another, the optimization of the NGS process can
be made by choosing levels that make heat generation much larger than
NOx generation. Thus, an optimization
can be made to maximize a different function that takes into account,
simultaneously, y1 and y3.

This objective function, f,
can be written as f = y1/y3, and the optimization for fixed y1 values leads to the minimization of y3 for the maximum set y1. This can be
thought of as the estimation of how much heat can be generated with
the least amount of NOx produced as a
side reaction. It should be noted that the maximum possible NGS yield
is presented in Table 3 and is 85.2%, with a NOx yield of 12.3%.
In the same sense, the NOx generated can
be reduced to a minimum yield of 1.32%, leading to a maximum overall
NGS yield of 16.5%. These two points are the limit of the function f, representing the set of maximum and minimum yields that
can be achieved for the subsea conditions. Optimizing the function
for different set values of y1 leads to Figure 11a.

Figure 11 (a) Optimization of
the objective function f for
different set values of y1 and (b) values
of the variables R and C.

It can be seen that decreasing the amount of generated
NOx leads to a decrease in the NGS yield,
which indicates
that less heat should be used in the application. However, it can
be noted that there are two regions with different slopes, indicating
that different phenomena control the system’s behavior. Evaluating
how the R and C variables change
for this function leads to Figure 11b.

Initially, going from the maximum to the minimum
NGS yield in the
gray region of Figure 11b, it can be seen that to decrease the NOx generation, the only variable that needs to be changed is the reagent
ratio because only this factor changes, while the factor [HAcO] remains
approximately constant (∼0.09 mol·L–1). This means that changing the catalyst concentration does not increase
the y1/y3 ratio,
which means losing heat at a cost of not reducing most of the NOx generated. This first region can be considered
a “reagent ratio controlled” and goes up to an overall
yield of around 50%. At this point, the reagent ratio is 1, indicating
that ammonium and nitrite concentrations are the same.

To decrease
even further the NOx generation,
the catalyst concentration must be reduced up to its smallest value
of 0.01 mol·L–1. This region can hence be considered
“catalyst controlled”. However, reducing NOx until this limit is not the ideal scenario because
reducing it leads to a bigger loss in the generated heat, which means
that more solution must be added to the system to achieve the same
amount of heat. Increasing the amount of solution increases the amount
of NOx that can be generated, which is
not ideal.

Because the minimum amount of NOx is
in the catalyst-controlled region, a plot of the function f against C shows how much concentration
needs to be decreased to maximize f. Results are
presented in Section S3 of the Supporting Information. It is seen that decreasing from C = 0 to C = −2 does not increase much the function f, which does not bring much gain to avoid the NOx problem. Hence, using a set of R = 0 and C = 0 leads to the highest y1/y3 ratio, in which the most
NOx is reduced in relationship to the
reduction in the amount of heat generated.

For this configuration,
the overall NGS yield is 40.9%, and the
NOx yield is 4.14%. For this combination,
by changing the partition value to P = 2, the NOx generation drops by about 47%, while the
heat generation is delayed (y2 drops about
20%). As discussed, the yield at the end of 11 h does not change once
the overall reaction yield is not changed by the partitioning of the
catalyst.

4 Conclusions
Minimizing NOx production in the NGS
requires careful control of ammonium/nitrite ratio and catalyst concentration
in order to ensure the lowest environmental impact in the application
of this technique, without prejudice to heat generation. Because these
factors exert opposite influences on heat and NOx generation, a balance between them is essential to achieve
the greatest and fastest heat release with the lowest NOx production. These conditions correspond to a ratio
of ammonium/nitrite equal to 1 and a catalyst concentration of 0.07
mol·L–1, for a case in which the temperature
is 5 °C (seafloor level). Still, the addition of the catalyst
over time is a good strategy to decrease NOx generation without affecting the maximum potential of heat
generation of the NGS.
