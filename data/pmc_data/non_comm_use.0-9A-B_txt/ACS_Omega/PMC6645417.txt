The
study presented in this paper investigates form changes of
propagating waves generated through precipitation reactions in a gel
matrix that possesses an inhomogeneous microstructure. The waves demonstrate
form changes from a single ring-like pattern to multiple target-like
waves. Subsequently, the waves take up a spiral form and ultimately
manifest themselves in the form of a turbulence pattern that intensifies
with increasing fluctuations within the gel structure. An investigation
into the dynamics of the precipitation waves reveals the existence
of an anomalous diffusion. The effective diffusion coefficients are
found to increase linearly with the quenching temperature. Further,
it is revealed through the analysis of the anomalous diffusion dynamics
that precipitation patterns could be adequately controlled by adjusting
the permeability fluctuations within the gel structure. The findings
of this study lead to a greater understanding of the spontaneous creation
of precipitation patterns by a system driven by disorder.

Introduction
Particle transport
in porous media or disordered systems does not
follow the classical laws that describe motion in ordered media. Transport
of particles in porous media, thus, exhibits many anomalous physical
properties. Precipitation reactions that occur in a gel matrix may
result in the creation of a range of patterns for particle transport.
These include static patterns with spatial regularities, such as the
Liesegang pattern1−4 and tree-like patterns,5,6 and dynamic patterns
that involve propagating waves, such as those generated by the Belousov–Zhabotinsky
(BZ) reaction.7,8 The creation of these patterns
is an important phenomenon that can be exploited for implementation
in diverse applications that include determination of the onset of
patterning in reaction–diffusion systems,3,9−11 material synthesis through the use of the self-organization
approach,12−14 diagnosis of Japanese encephalitis, microscopic examination
of mucocutaneous lesions, calcification of epithelial odontogenic
tumors, and fine-needle aspiration of breast cysts.15−18

In contrast to the familiar
BZ reactions that result in the formation
of reaction–diffusion waves, precipitation reactions that result
in pattern formation do not exhibit the apparent autocatalytic reactions.
The primary cause of the formation of various patterns, therefore,
remains unknown. It was previously believed that the gel matrix merely
acts to prevent the convection of current from disturbing the formation
of the spatiotemporal patterns. However, studies performed over the
last decade have provided a deeper insight into the role of the gel
matrix. For example, modifying the gel concentration or adding other
gels to the configuration and changing the precipitation reaction
temperature leads to thinning of the Liesegang bands4 and changes the precipitation pattern from the Liesegang-type
to a tree-like one.5,6 It has been proposed that variations
in the diffusion coefficient, supersaturation, and pore size of the
gel are probable causes of the above pattern transition phenomenon.
However, changes in the gel concentration and type as well as precipitation
reaction temperature lead to changes in multiple physicochemical properties
of the gel matrix. These undesirable changes, which occur simultaneously,
represent a significant obstacle in elucidating the exact properties
of the gel that play a crucial role in pattern formation. This prevents
us from fully exploiting the benefits of this phenomenon for use in
technical applications. As such, the study proposed in this paper
evaluates the effect of only a specific property—gel microstructure—on
the formation of precipitation patterns in the absence of changes
in other properties of the gel matrix.

Results and Discussion
The method based on quenching of an agar solution was used in this
study to prepare gels. The magnitude of compositional fluctuations
in the structure was altered by controlling the quenching temperature, Tq, while maintaining a constant agar concentration.
Agar was specifically used as the gel matrix because agarose is a
major component of agar and its solution undergoes phase separation
at temperatures below 45 °C.19 The
correlation length of compositional fluctuations in the agarose gel
increases from 0.5 to 1.5 μm corresponding to an increase in Tq.19 The diffusion
coefficient of the outer electrolyte in the gel, shear modulus, and
compressive strength of the gel were monitored as functions of Tq (as depicted in Figures S1 and S2). The resulting gel structure exhibited an increase
of 20.3% in the diffusion coefficient and respective decrements of
29.6 and 32.8% in the shear modulus and compressive strength corresponding
to an increase in Tq from 10 to 40 °C.
Although the macroscopic properties demonstrated an increase by only
20–30% corresponding to the above increase in Tq, the correlation length of compositional fluctuations
was found to have increased by a factor of 3. The quenching method
allows for significant changes caused exclusively to the gel microstructure,
while the macroscopic properties remain largely unaffected.

The precipitation system used in this study consisted of AlCl3/NaOH. The precipitation and complex formations that occur
can be explained by the following reactions:      When AlCl3 and
NaOH are used as
inner and outer electrolytes, respectively, a single traveling precipitation
band appears when the gel is viewed from the side. The band is seen
to propagate downward in accordance with the diffusion law.20 However, when the gel is viewed from a point
directly above the setup, precipitation waves in the form of a single
ring-like wave, counter-rotating spiral wave, and turbulence wave
are observed. These waves are found to travel at a rate much higher
than that suggested by the diffusion law. The measured time scale
of the traveling precipitation waves (10–1000 s) is much smaller
than that of the single traveling precipitation band (1–100
h). While patterns of the traveling precipitation waves are known
to depend upon the AlCl3 concentration, the effect of the
gel matrix remains unknown. We investigated the effect of changes
in Tq on the patterns of the traveling
precipitation waves. In these investigations, the precipitation temperature
(T = 25 °C) and the gel and outer electrolyte
concentrations (Cgel = 4 w/w % and COH = 2.5 M) were maintained constant.

Typical patterns corresponding to the precipitation reaction are
shown in Figure 1,
which corresponds to the case wherein AlCl3 is homogeneously
distributed at various concentrations (CAl) in the agar solution. During the initial phase of the precipitation
reaction, a light region forms over the entire image, corresponding
to a precipitation band. Subsequently, the thinning region of the
precipitation band appears in the form of a dark region that covers
the light region. The thinning phenomenon transforms the precipitation
band into a diagonal precipitation feature owing to redissolution
of the precipitate.8 The dark region creates
various patterns. Corresponding to AlCl3 concentrations
below 0.23 M, no pattern is observed. With the increase in CAl, the precipitation patterns are seen to change
from an initial single ring-like wave to a target-type waveform. Subsequently,
the waves take up a spiral form, which later evolves into a collapsing
pattern. Finally, the precipitation waves manifest themselves in the
form of a turbulence pattern (see Movies S1–S5). The complexity of the precipitation
patterns increases with the increase in CAl.

Figure 1 Typical precipitation waves in 4 w/w % agar gel at Tq = 25 °C. (a) Single ring-like wave at CAl = 0.24 M, (b) target-like waves at CAl = 0.28 M, (c) spiral-like waves at CAl = 0.30 M, (d) collapsing pattern at CAl = 0.32 M, and (e) turbulence pattern at CAl = 0.40 M. T = 25 °C, Cgel = 4 w/w %, and COH = 2.5 M. Scale bars are 2 mm.

The formation mechanism of target-like waves observed during
precipitation
reactions is different from that of similar waves observed during
BZ reactions.21−23Figure S3 depicts the
formation process of target-like waves and their subsequent transition
into the spiral form (see Movie S3). The
target-like waves observed during precipitation reactions originate
owing to collisions between two counter-rotating arms of precipitation
waves (see the Supporting Information).
The experimental results indicate that in contrast to BZ reaction
mechanisms, the gel matrix in a precipitation system does not behave
like an oscillatory medium. The spiral-like waves are generated from
collisions that occur between asymmetric curled arms (see Movie S4 and the Supporting Information).

With CAl >
0.3 M, a collapsing pattern
appears. At this point, the traveling spiral or target-like waves
break spontaneously, and many defects are generated. This process
continues until the entire system is filled with defects and becomes
darker. With further increase in CAl,
a turbulence pattern is formed. The turbulence pattern develops following
an inverse sequence when compared to the collapsing pattern. This
implies that during the development of the turbulence pattern, the
entire system is first filled with a dark region, and subsequently,
a light region, which continues to increase in size, is generated
randomly. Volford et al. demonstrated that the turbulence pattern
increases in size in a self-similar manner, and its characteristic
length scale increases in proportion to the square root of the elapsed
time (t1/2).24

The precipitation pattern, as a function of Tq and CAl, was evaluated five
times
for each measurement. Table 1 lists the phase diagram of the precipitation pattern in the Tq–CAl space.
In the case where two or more patterns coexist in the same vessel,
the more dominant of the two was defined as the typical pattern. The
dominant pattern existing at 60 min from the start of the precipitation
reaction for the five measurements is included in Table 1. Interestingly, the patterns
demonstrate a change from simple to complex forms with an increase
in Tq, although CAl is maintained constant. For example, at Tq = 10 °C and CAl = 0.28
M, a single expanding ring-like wave is observed. Upon increasing Tq, the target-like waveform becomes dominant,
and upon further increasing Tq, the spiral
wave and collapsing patterns are observed. We observed that with the
increase in Tq, the symmetry of the precipitation
pattern is broken, and the pattern becomes complex at different concentrations.
It must be noted here that the precipitation reaction temperature
has no bearing on the pattern formation at constant quenching temperature
(see Table S1).

The tendency of
the complexity of precipitation patterns to increase
with the increase in CAl is consistent
with the study reported by Ayass et al.25 They have demonstrated that the wavelength of precipitation waves
decreases monotonically with the increase in CAl regardless of the dominant precipitation patterns. The effect
of CAl on the pattern formation is discussed
later in this paper, and an in-depth quantitative analysis of the
effect of quenching temperature on pattern formation is discussed
in the following passages.

The dynamics of the single ring-like
and target-like waves were
evaluated corresponding to an increase in Tq. The dynamics of the single ring-like wave follow the laws of the
diffusion process, that is, , where r(t) and Dr are, respectively,
the radius
and effective diffusion coefficient of the single ring-like wave (see Figure S4). The effective diffusion coefficient
is found to increase by a factor of 3 corresponding to an increase
in Tq when the precipitation reaction
temperature and the gel and outer electrolyte concentrations are maintained
constant (Figure 2a).
On the other hand, as Tq increases, the
dynamics of the target-like waves deviate from the laws of the diffusion
process, and an anomalous diffusion is found to occur according to
the relationship, r ∝ tα (see Figure S5). The exponent
α in this relation increases from 0.5 to approximately 0.75
with an increase in Tq. In addition, we
investigated the dispersion relationship between the angular frequency,
ω, and the wavenumber, k, for target-like waves
with CAl = 0.28 M. Because a simple polynomial
form (ω = a0 + a1k + a2k2 + a3k3...) cannot be used, we propose the following empirical
expression to evaluate the above dispersion relationship (see the Supporting Information). 1  Here, Deff and k0 refer to fitting
parameters having dimensions
of the diffusion coefficient and the wavenumber, respectively. Corresponding
to each value of Tq, a linear relationship
was obtained allowing for the calculation of Deff and k0 from eq 1 (see Figure S6). Figure 2b,c demonstrates the relationship between the two fitting parameters
and Tq. Deff increases linearly by a factor of 3.3 with an increase in Tq from 10 to 35 °C, whereas k0, by-and-large, remains constant (k0–2 = 0.13 ± 0.03 mm2).

diffusion coefficient and wavenumber of the target-like waves calculated

There exist many different reasons, which could lead to anomalous
diffusion in porous media.26,27 The anomalous diffusion
observed in the gel may be related to its geometrical factors. Matheron
and de Marsily28 proposed a model of a
two-dimensional stratified porous medium, wherein the transport of
particles in the vertical direction follows the diffusion law; the
transverse velocity V(z), however,
is constant at the layer and is a function of the elevation z of the layer, thereby realizing a non-Fickian type of
transport. Permeability fluctuations cause the local flow velocity
to exhibit a random distribution in each layer. The velocity distribution,
considered to be white noise, can be described in terms of the relationship—⟨V(z)⟩ = 0,⟨V(z)V(z′)⟩
= σVδ(z – z′)—where σV represents the variance
of the velocity distribution related to the permeability fluctuations
and δ is the Dirac delta function. The average-squared displacement
of the particles along the horizontal direction can be expressed as
follows:26,28 2  Here, D⊥ represents the vertical diffusion coefficient.
The precipitation
system investigated in this study resembles the model proposed by
Matheron and de Marsily because transport of the precipitate in the
vertical direction occurs through a diffusion process;20 on the other hand, the precipitation wave in
the horizontal direction propagates in the form of a chemical wave.7,8 Thus, ⟨X2⟩ in the above
model corresponds to r(t)2 in the precipitation system. The value for σV can
be determined from eq 2 using the value of D⊥ determined
in a previous study.20Figure 3 shows the relationship between
σV and Tq, in which the
value of σV increases by 3.7 times corresponding
to an increase in Tq from 10 to 35 °C.

Figure 3 Relationship
between the variance of velocity distribution σV and Tq at CAl = 0.28
M. σV was calculated from eq 2 . For Tq = 10
°C, even though the value of α was approximately
0.5, we calculated σV using eq 1.

Localized impacts on the surface of excitable media or defects
formed in the media can initiate chemical waves.29,30 It was confirmed during the experiments that scratching of the gel
matrix with tweezers during the precipitation reaction and insertion
of a polytetrafluoroethylene plate prior to the precipitation reaction
demonstrated no effect on the pattern formation of precipitation waves.

As previously described, the increase in Tq increases the complexity of the precipitation patterns. Because
macroscopic properties increase by only 20–30% with an increase
in Tq, the corresponding increase in the
effective diffusion coefficients of the single ring-like and target-like
waves reflects a change in the gel microstructure. The increase in Tq leads to an increase in the correlation length
of compositional fluctuations,19 which
in turn alters the permeability of the gel and leads to an improvement
in the mobility of precipitation reaction waves. The correlation length
of compositional fluctuations in the agarose gel was found to have
increased from 0.5 to 1.5 μm with an increase in Tq.19 The particle size of the
precipitate was measured using an electron microscope (see Figure S7). The imaging results revealed that
the particles grew up to 1–5 μm, and their size was comparable
to the correlation length of compositional fluctuations in the agarose
gel. The effective diffusion coefficients of the single ring-like
and target-like patterns were found to have increased by a factor
of 3. At the same time, the increase in Tq was accompanied by a coarsening of the gel matrix and an increase
in the correlation length of compositional fluctuations. The rate
of increase of σV was found to coincide with that
of the effective diffusion coefficients of the single ring-like and
target-like patterns.

From the above observations, it could
be inferred that a change
in the microstructure of the gel results in changes in the pattern
dynamics of precipitation waves. For low values of Tq, the precipitation waves grow symmetrically because
the variance in permeability fluctuations is small. This leads to
the formation of highly symmetric precipitation patterns, such as
the observed single ring-like and target-like waves. With increase
in Tq, precipitation waves pass through
an inhomogeneous gel microstructure, and each arm of these precipitation
waves undergoes a different degree of hysteresis in terms of permeability
fluctuations. This causes an asymmetric development of each arm of
the precipitation waves. As a result, the symmetric precipitation
patterns are broken spontaneously, thereby leading to asymmetrical
patterns. Correspondingly, the single ring-like and target-like waves
transform to the spiral-like waveform. On the basis of reaction–diffusion
equations, Tinsley et al.31 demonstrated
that the occurrence of spiral waves is based on the assumption of
the existence of the second precipitate that exhibits directional
growth at the wave front. It is also assumed that further formation
of spiral waves ceases when the concentration of the second precipitate
exceeds a certain threshold value. The study claimed that the directional
growth plays an essential role in the dynamics of propagating waves.
Changes in the microstructure of the gel may also cause suppression
of the formation of the second precipitate. However, the phenomenon
of anomalous diffusion requires the existence of disordered media.
Therefore, theoretical models of propagating precipitation waves must
account for the effect of the gel matrix.

An increase in CAl results in an increase
in the value of the exponent α, as shown in Figure S5, and the complexity of the precipitation patterns.
For CAl = 0.25 M, the single ring-like
wave follows the diffusion law, whereas for CAl = 0.28 M the target-like waves exhibit anomalous diffusion.
Ayass et al. reported that for the HgCl2/KI system, the
exponent α was found to have increased with an increase in the
concentration of Hg2+ ions.32,33 The results
indicate that an increase in the concentration of the internal electrolyte
serves to alter the gel microstructure, thereby leading to increased
compositional fluctuations. This increase in compositional fluctuations
may manifest itself as noise. As shown in Figure 1, the number density of precipitation patterns
increases with an increase in CAl. This
increase in number density corresponds to an increase in the number
of nucleation. When the noise becomes large in excitable media, breakup
and spontaneous nucleation of spirals are found to occur; simultaneously,
a pattern curvature is also found to have increased.34 The higher the pattern curvature, the shorter is the wavelength.
This tendency is consistent with the findings reported by Ayass et
al.25 The increase in noise caused by changes
in the gel microstructure may result in more complex precipitation
patterns, such as collapsing and turbulence patterns.

Conclusions
The effects of compositional inhomogeneity of the gel matrix on
morphological changes in the precipitation wave pattern have been
experimentally demonstrated in this study by using a gel prepared
by the quenching method. Because even a gel quenched to 25 °C
exhibits phase separation, the inhomogeneous gel used here is not
specific. Many researchers in the past may have subconsciously carried
out experiments concerning precipitation waves using inhomogeneous
gel matrices. This could perhaps be attributed to the fact that heated
gel solutions require to be allowed to set and return to room temperature
for gelation. In this study, we have made an effective use of an inhomogeneous
gel to elucidate the quantitative relationship between its microstructure
and the dynamics of pattern formation of precipitation waves based
on an analysis of anomalous diffusion dynamics. It has been inferred
that an increase in permeability fluctuations of the gel induces superdiffusion
of precipitation waves, thereby increasing the complexity of precipitation
patterns. The inhomogeneous gel reported in this study could be prepared
with ease and is expected to be useful for studying the pattern formation
of precipitation waves induced by other electrolytes as well as that
of chemical waves in gel media.35−37 Adjusting permeability fluctuations
of the gel may enable users to exercise control over precipitation
patterns.

Experimental Section
Preparation Method of Agar Gel
Agar
(Wako, guaranteed
grade) was added to pure water at 4 w/w % on a hot plate maintained
at 80 °C under gentle stirring to prevent bubble generation.
The solution was removed from the hot plate, and a predetermined amount
of AlCl3·6H2O (Wako, guaranteed grade)
was added to the solution and completely dissolved by stirring for
5 min. This mixture (20 mL) was transferred to a Petri dish, covered
with a lid, sealed, and left in a thermostatic bath at different quenching
temperatures (10–40 °C) for 24 h. After gelation, the
Petri dish was removed from the bath. A 2.5 M NaOH solution (20 mL)
was poured into the formed gel, and the reaction was observed at room
temperature (25 °C). The pattern formation of the propagating
precipitation band was recorded by a digital camera (PENTAX, Optio
WG-2) at 1 min intervals for 1.5 h or by a digital video camera (Panasonic,
HDC-TM30) with a main light source positioned above the dish. A light
region in images corresponds to a precipitation band because this
illumination configuration is opposed to that of the Tinsley’s
experiment.8 The recorded movies were analyzed
by an image processing software (ImageJ).
