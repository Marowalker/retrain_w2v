Computer-assisted drug design (CADD)
methods have greatly contributed
to the development of new drugs. Among CADD methodologies, virtual
screening (VS) can enrich the compound collection with molecules that
have the desired physicochemical and pharmacophoric characteristics
that are needed to become drugs. Many free tools are available for
this purpose, but they are difficult to use and do not have a graphical
user interface. Furthermore, several free tools must be used to carry
out the entire VS process, requiring the user to process the results
of one software program so that they can be used in another program,
adding a potential source of human error. Moreover, some software
programs require knowledge of advanced computational skills, such
as programming languages. This context has motivated us to develop
Molecular Architect (MolAr). MolAr is a workflow with a simple and
intuitive interface that acts in an integrated and automated form
to perform the entire VS process, from protein preparation (homology
modeling and protonation state) to virtual screening. MolAr carries
out VS through AutoDock Vina, DOCK 6, or a consensus of the two. Two
case studies were conducted to demonstrate the performance of MolAr.
In the first study, the feasibility of using MolAr for DNA–ligand
systems was assessed. Both AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 showed good results
in performing VS in DNA–ligand systems. However, the use of
consensus virtual screening was able to enrich the results. According
to the area under the ROC curve and the enrichment factors, consensus
VS was better able to predict the positions of the active ligands.
The second case study was performed on 8 targets from the DUD-E database
and 10 active ligands for each target. The results demonstrated that
using the final ligand conformation provided by AutoDock Vina as an
input for DOCK 6 improved the DOCK 6 ROC curves by up to 42% in VS.
These case studies demonstrated that MolAr is capable conducting the
VS process and is an easy-to-use and effective tool. MolAr is available
for download free of charge at http: //www.drugdiscovery.com.br/software/.

==== Body
Introduction
The drug design process aims to identify
bioactive compounds to
assist in the treatment of diseases. The development of a new drug
has an average cost of $2.6 billion1 and
can take 12–14 years.2Figure 1 shows a summary
of the developmental process of a new drug, which starts with the
identification of molecular targets for a given compound and is followed
by their validation. Next, virtual screening (VS) can be used to identify
active drug candidates (hit identification), and biologically active
compounds are transformed into appropriate drugs by improving their
physicochemical compositions (lead optimization). Finally, optimized
leads undergo preclinical and clinical trials before they are approved
for use by regulatory bodies.3

Figure 1 Drug design
process.

One way to minimize costs and
time in the drug development process
is making use of computer-aided drug design (CADD) methodologies.4 CADD is a fast and valid methodology that is
used for researching new compounds with pharmacological potential.5,6 CADD allows many molecules to be analyzed in a short time and enables
the simulation and prediction of several essential factors, such as
toxicity, activity, bioavailability, and efficacy, even before the
compound is submitted to in vitro testing.5

In this context, VS is used to identify new hits in large
compound
libraries. VS uses computational methods to identify promising bioactive
substances.7

The use of virtual screening
in drug development, however, has
some drawbacks. There are several advantages and disadvantages to
be considered:1 Advantagesa. Virtual screening of millions of small
compounds can be performed computationally in a short amount of time,
minimizing the timeline and the total cost of developing new drugs.

b. The ligand molecules used
in VS do
not need to exist physically. Thus, a molecule can be screened before
it is synthesized. If VS demonstrates that a molecule is not a good
candidate, there is no need to synthesize it.

c. There are several free and proprietary
tools available to assist in VS.



2. Disadvantagesa. Some VS tools work best in specific
cases.8 Thus, the result may be different,
depending on the tool used.

b. It is difficult to set the parameters
of the ligand–receptor binding interactions. Therefore, it
is challenging to predict the correct binding position of the compounds.

c. VS can generate false positives
and
false negatives; thus, it can discard promising ligands or indicate
a compound as an active ligand that will prove to be inactive in a
subsequent stage of development.





Despite its disadvantages, VS is a widely used tool
in drug design
and has been used extensively in recent years,7,9−14 which indicates that although there are disadvantages, the reduced
time and cost enabled by VS is useful and promising for the development
of new drugs.

One of the most widely used VS techniques is structure-based
drug
design (SBDD).15 SBDD attempts to predict
the best binding orientation with the best binding affinity and/or
free energy of two molecules to form a stable complex, but it requires
knowledge of the 3D structure of the target to predict the interactions
between the target and the ligand.16

The availability of a 3D structure of a molecular target is essential
for performing VS, but these structures are difficult to obtain experimentally.
Additionally, the atomic coordinates of highly flexible loops in available
structures are often poorly described by experimental methods. As
a result, there are often gaps in the structure, and these may be
near the binding site. Predicting the 3D structure of a protein from
its amino acid sequence can be accomplished by homology modeling (HM).
HM predicts a protein structure based on the general observation that
proteins with similar sequences have similar structures.17 Consequently, minor changes in the sequence
will result in only small changes in the 3D structure.18

VS would be more effective if it took
the different protonation
states of the ligand and the molecular target into consideration since
the proteins around the active site may influence the local pH.19 However, the position of hydrogen atoms cannot
be determined experimentally by X-ray crystallography.20 Most ligand–receptor interactions are
pH-dependent, and the protonation states of the molecules must be
appropriately assigned.21 Adjusting the
protonation state of ligands and targets can be done manually, but
since structure databases contain thousands of compounds, this preparation
should be done automatically.

After performing virtual screening,
the next challenge of this
method is to differentiate compounds that are active against the target
from those that are inactive (false positives).22 Thus, VS tools must have ways to assist their users to
distinguish false positives from true positives. The ROC curve and
the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC)23 are widely used for this purpose. The AUC value can vary between
0 and 1; if the AUC is above 0.70, then the software program used
is satisfactorily separating active from inactive ligands.24

Consensus virtual screening (CVS) has
been used to increase the
accuracy of VS studies and reduce the number of false positives obtained
in virtual screening.25−31 The main idea of this technique is that the combination of two different
approaches in VS is better than the application of a single approach
alone.30 CVS is a relatively recent technique,
and although it has not yet been widely applied in the literature,27 it has presented some promising results.25,28,30,31 However, CVS is difficult to apply as the use of more than one approach
involves handling entries in different formats and using various software
programs. Hence, if CVS could be performed automatically, this technique
could be more widely applied.

Due to the importance of CADD
in modern drug development, many
software programs have been developed to perform particular operations
throughout the VS process.2,32−34 In general, the existing free software programs do not perform the
whole VS process in an automated way, making it necessary to combine
several free software programs, such as Pymol,35 MGLTools,36 MODELLER,37 PROPKA,38 Chimera,39 AutoDock Vina,40 and
DOCK 6.41 Thus, a large effort is required
from researchers, which makes VS more prone to human errors. Another
problem of using free software is the complexity of their interfaces.
Sometimes, the software has no graphical interface, and it must be
used by entering command lines (e.g., AutoDock Vina40 and DOCK 642), making it very
difficult to use for those who are not comfortable with command-line
programs. In some cases, such as MODELLER,37 the program is even more difficult to use because the user needs
prior knowledge in computer programming languages.

Therefore,
developing an easy-to-use software program would have
a great value for the VS process since automated procedures ensure
that the methods can be easily reproduced, excluding the variability
of a manual process performed by a human. This type of program would
allow the results of VS to be evaluated and compared with greater
reliability and accuracy.

This paper presents Molecular Architect
(MolAr), a workflow composed
of a set of integrated tools that carries out the VS process. MolAr
does not require the researcher to have advanced computational skills
(e.g., installation of tools and libraries, need for prior knowledge
in computer programming languages), thus facilitating the execution
of VS simulations through simplifying and automating the process.
The application of MolAr is expected to decrease human error in VS
and execute the procedures at a greater speed due to the simplified,
integrated, and automated VS process. In addition, MolAr implements
a consensus virtual screening approach between AutoDock Vina and DOCK
6, and it was evaluated in two case studies demonstrating that it
was able to achieve satisfactory results when performing in silico
simulations. MolAr represents promising VS software. MolAr has an
easy-to-use interface and does not require multiple software programs
to be run from the command line to perform the VS process.

Methods
MolAr is a workflow composed of a set of tools that act in an integrated
manner to carry out the entire virtual screening process, from protein
preparation (homology modeling, necessary asymmetry, protonation)
to virtual screening. MolAr was developed using the high-level programming
languages Java and Python.

MolAr has intuitive interfaces that
negate the need for advanced
computing knowledge, making it accessible to a wider range of people. Figure 2 shows the virtual
screening workflow using MolAr. First, after MolAr initialization,
if it is necessary to perform homology modeling, then MolAr uses MODELLER
to perform this task. The protonation state of the protein can then
be adjusted using PROPKA38 (targets) and
Open Babel43 (ligands), in which the pH
can be defined by the user. Finally, VS can be performed. MolAr can
be applied in three different ways: using AutoDock Vina,40 DOCK 6,42 or through
a consensus virtual screening (CVS) that uses a combination of the
AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 results.

Figure 2 MolAr workflow.

MolAr was evaluated and validated at the pharmaceutical chemistry
laboratory of the Federal University of São João del-Rei.
In the first stage of the tests, only researchers from the pharmaceutical
chemistry laboratory used the program. In this way, the execution
was carried out in a more controlled environment. Problems that arose
during the execution were solved and served as an opportunity to improve
the platform. Next, two case studies were performed using MolAr; these
will be discussed in this paper. The first case study investigated
the feasibility of using MolAr for DNA–ligand systems. In this
case study, both AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 presented good reliability
when considering the AUC-ROC values, but the use of consensus virtual
screening was able to enrich these results. The second case study
demonstrated that applying DOCK 6 using the final ligand conformation
provided by AutoDock Vina improved DOCK 6 performance during VS and
consequently improved the VS results. The simulations using the amber
score were performed in 3000 steps and 100 energy minimization cycles,
and the ligand conformational searching was enabled. In the simulations,
the ligand was allowed to move during scoring. In the AutoDock Vina
simulations, the dimensions of the box was 20 on the x, y, and z axes, and the exhaustiveness
parameter was set to 24 to provide a better docking result.44 MolAr refined the ligands through MOPAC201645 using the Parametric Method 7 (PM7) and EF routine
to search for the structure of local minimum. The configuration files
used in the simulations, containing all the applied parameters, can
be accessed in the supporting materials. There are Windows and Linux
versions of MolAr, and it is freely available for download at http://www.drugdiscovery.com.br/.

Results and Discussion
It is necessary to install several
software programs to perform
VS when using free software, and many of them are difficult to install
and/or configure. MolAr automates the installation and configuration
process of all software programs it requires to execute VS. These
are Open JDK, which contains the necessary infrastructure to develop
and run Java applications, Python, MOPAC2016,45 MODELLER,37 Procheck,46 Pymol,35 Jmol,47 Pdb2pqr,38 MPI,48 AutoDock Vina 1.1.2,40 DOCK
6,42 Sphgen (available for download at http://dock.compbio.ucsf.edu/Contributed_Code/sphgen_cpp.htm), AutoDocktools,36 Chimera,39 AmberTools,49 Open
Babel,43 MGLTools,36 and some software installed by DOCK 6 (DMS, Grid, and Showbox).
Thus, MolAr can facilitate VS experiments by automating the process.

There are software packages similar to MolAr. However, they have
limitations that MolAr does not have, such as lack of support in the
free version (PyRx50), an inability to
perform consensus virtual screening (EasyVS51 and Raccoon244), and limits on the number
of ligands (DockThor52,53 limits guest users to 100 structures
and approved project users are limited to 1000 structures). Moreover,
none of these software packages can perform homology modeling, whereas
MolAr uses MODELLER54 for this step.

MolAr has three main menus: target builder, docking, and tools.

Target
Builder Menu
The target builder (TB) menu contains
features related to predicting the 3D structure of a protein from
its amino acid sequence (homology modeling). MolAr uses MODELLER55 to perform homology modeling. Although MODELLER
is quite complete, it is necessary for one to know the Python programming
language to perform the modeling. Moreover, because it is necessary
to know the 3D structure of a protein to realize VS, it would be beneficial
if homology modeling could be performed by the same tool used to perform
VS. In this way, the user could build the target protein from its
amino acid sequence or build gap regions of a target protein whose
3D structure already exists prior to performing VS.

MolAr renders
MODELLER easier to use and eliminates the need for knowing Python.

Other software also facilitates the use of MODELLER, such as the
Modweb webserver.55 However, this software
specializes in homology modeling, while MolAr allows the user to perform
several virtual screening steps in a single tool.

MolAr carries
out the homology modeling process in 15 steps (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Target builder workflow.

After initiating the homology modeling process (step 1 in Figure 3), MolAr checks which
data type the researcher has provided. If the user entered the PDB
code, MolAr will download the FASTA file corresponding to that code.
If the user entered the PDB file, MolAr will convert the PDB file
to a FASTA file. If the system performed steps 2 or 3 or if the user
entered the FASTA sequence, MolAr will convert the FASTA file to a
file in the alignment format used by MODELLER. MolAr identifies the
templates to be used in the homology modeling process (if the user
has not specified them) and automatically downloads the PDB files
corresponding to the selected templates. MolAr then identifies the
similarities between the selected templates to perform multiple alignments
of them. Next, the protein is aligned to the multiple templates selected,
and models are built by MODELLER in parallel. The DOPE score and the
RMSD between the generated model and the templates are then calculated.
MolAr generates the Ramachandran plot for each model using Procheck;46 finally, a window with the results is shown
to the user.

In the homology modeling process, it is important
to know whether
the developed model is of sufficient quality. Thus, for each model
built, MolAr displays the value of the RMSD relative to the target
template and allows the visualization of the Ramachandran plot (generated
using Procheck46). In this way, the user
can decide which model is the best. The results screen also allows
the results to be ordered in ascending or descending order.

Occasionally, an available 3D structure contains gaps. These residues
are documented in the PDB file, but during X-ray crystallography,
it was not possible to determine their atomic coordinates. The MolAr
missing residues option was created to address this problem by applying
homology modeling. If there are gaps in the target protein’s
PDB file, MolAr can still try to fill them in by making changes only
in the gap region, which causes fewer changes in the pre-existing
3D structure than if homology modeling was applied for the entire
protein.

Docking Menu
The docking menu has features that execute
the molecular docking and virtual screening procedures. The developed
platform allows the realization of virtual screening through AutoDock
Vina,40 DOCK 641 or a consensus between them.

AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 were
chosen to integrate MolAr because both tools are free and effective.
Several recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AutoDock
Vina and DOCK 6 in the development of new drugs. Among them, Lagarde
et al.56 validated the use of AutoDock
Vina in the development of cancer drugs, Shukla et al.57 used AutoDock Vina to identify a potential anti-fasciolid
compound, and Kondratyev and Zakharova58 used AutoDock Vina to simulate and analyze the interactions of peroxiredoxin
6 with captopril, unithiol, succimer, cystamine, and three cysteine-containing
peptides, ECECE, KCKCK, and ACC. DOCK 641 is an enhanced version of DOCK 5 with additional sampling, scoring,
and optimization features, fixed bugs, and the ability to conduct
RNA compatibility testing. Holden et al.59 employed DOCK 6.5 in the successful discovery of novel HIVgp41 inhibitors.
Nunes et al.12 used DOCK 6 to select a
compound that was active and selective against Plasmodium
falciparum. These results were later confirmed by
in vitro assays, indicating that DOCK 6 correctly identified the compound.
In addition, DOCK 6 has been integrated with AmberTools and is one
of the few free software packages with graphics processing unit (GPU)
implementation for AMBER scoring and PBSA/GBSA calculations for target–ligand60 complexes, which allows for faster calculation
of the AMBER scoring function. MolAr allows the user to apply these
features during docking. Allen et al.41 described additional cases of the successful use of DOCK, such as
in the discovery of a new amidohydrolase,61 thiamine synthase phosphate.62

MolAr has two integrated databases: the Our Own Molecular Target
(OOMT)7 and the Brazilian Malaria Molecular
Target (BRAMMT) databases.12 The OOMT database
comprises various receptors from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) and includes
specific targets for cancer, dengue, and malaria. The BRAMMT database
comprises receptors for P. falciparum. The MolAr docking menu contains three submenus: Octopus, DOCK 6,
and consensus virtual screening.

Octopus Submenu
The Octopus submenu63 performs VS using
AutoDock Vina.40 Octopus carries out the
VS process using AutoDock Vina in two different
forms depending on which menu option is chosen: with previous execution
of MOPAC201645 (a semi-empirical quantum
chemistry program) or without running MOPAC2016. By implementing MOPAC2016,
the net atomic charge for each atom in each molecule is calculated,
avoiding massive work by the user. Next, the ligands, in PDB file
format, are refined through MOPAC2016 using Parametric Method 7 (PM7)64 and the EF routine65 to search for the structure of the local minimum. An overview of
the Octopus workflow can be seen in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Octopus workflow.

First, directories of the ligands and targets are chosen. The ligands
must be in the PDB format, and files in the target directory must
be in the AutoDock Vina format. If the user chooses to refine the
ligands, MolAr will perform the refinement using MOPAC2016.45 Next, ligands are converted from PDB to PDBQT
file format while assigning the rotatable bonds and the Gasteiger–Marsili
net atomic charges.66 Only those hydrogens
on polar atoms (oxygen and nitrogen) are kept, while other hydrogens
atoms are removed. A visual inspection of the geometries of the ligands
can then be performed through PyMOL.35 In
the next step, docking is carried out using AutoDock Vina, which runs
until all the ligands have been docked to a set of targets. Finally,
the target–ligand binding energies for the complex are generated.
The standard crystallographic values for the binding energies between
the ligand and target are also displayed.

Database Manager Option
of Octopus Submenu
The Database
Manager option of the Octopus submenu is used to manage the Octopus
database. This functionality allows the user to create a new database
and verify that the target databases used by Octopus are correct.
Target databases are constantly changing as new molecules are inserted
or targets are modified. If the database updates do not follow a standard,
VS can fail, and precious time is spent trying to identify and correct
the problem. To solve this, the Database Manager was developed. This
feature corrects the format and any inconsistences in the databases
to be used by Octopus. The Database Manager tool has three basic functions:
creation of a new database, fixing problems in an existing database,
and editing the data stored in an existing database. If there are
any missing or incorrect data in the database, it is possible to alter
this manually.

Dock 6 Submenu
The DOCK 6 program
was created in the
1980s by Irwin and Kuntz’s group at the Pharmaceutical Chemistry
Laboratory of the University of California and was the first docking
program.41,67 In our method, a graphical interface was
developed to enable VS using DOCK 6 with a minimal amount of user
effort. The user does not have to intervene much in the process, and
it is expected that fewer human errors will be committed because the
workflow is automatic. Figure 5 illustrates the execution of the DOCK 6 workflow performed
by MolAr.

Figure 5 DOCK 6 workflow.

In the workflow presented
in Figure 5, the user
initiates re-docking or VS with DOCK 6.
It is necessary to first prepare the molecular target and the ligand
(add hydrogens and calculate charges). MolAr performs this task automatically
using Chimera.39 Thereafter, the binding
site is prepared using the DMS program to calculate the target surface
to which the solvent will have access. Next, spheres representing
the binding site are created using the sphgen_cpp program. This program
defines the volume or space within the binding site where the drug
will interact. Its purpose is to generate a grid of sphere centers
that reflects the shape of the active site. Next, the box (which is
the cubic region where DOCK 6 will perform the docking) is generated
using the Showbox program. After box generation, the grid energies
are calculated using the grid program. Next, docking is conducted
by DOCK 6. If the user is performing VS and if there are additional
ligands, docking will be performed again with all ligands. If VS is
not required or if there are no more targets, then the result screen
will be shown. Finally, the user can save the results and close the
DOCK 6 results screen.

Consensus Virtual Screening (CVS)
MolAr implements
CVS between DOCK 6 and AutoDock Vina. Figure 6 shows the workflow of the CVS approach implemented
by MolAr. First, VS using AutoDock Vina is performed as described
in Figure 4. The AutoDock
Vina output (pdbqt file) is then converted to the DOCK 6 format by
MolAr and the Open Babel43 program. Next,
VS is performed using DOCK 6, as described in Figure 5. During the consensus, AutoDock Vina is
executed first followed by DOCK 6. This is because DOCK 6 allows docking
using the amber score. If DOCK 6 were executed before AutoDock Vina
during the consensus, the gains obtained from the molecular dynamics
performed by DOCK 6 with the amber score would be lost. Before displaying
the results, the AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 results are merged. Finally,
the CVS score is calculated and displayed to the user.

Figure 6 Consensus virtual screening
workflow.

The scoring function results displayed
by AutoDock Vina and DOCK
6 are normalized to values between 0 and 10. The CVS score calculated
by MolAr corresponds to the average between these two values. Thus,
the CVS scoring function is calculated according to the following
equation:  

In the consensus approach, as an input to DOCK 6, MolAr uses the
resulting ligand conformation after performing docking with AutoDock
Vina, thus aiming to achieve better results with DOCK 6 since it starts
from a conformation already optimized by AutoDock Vina. The final
ligand pose selected by consensus virtual screening is the pose defined
by DOCK 6.

Tools Menu
MolAr is integrated with
a set of tools
to support the realization of the entire VS process. With these tools,
it is possible to visualize the 3D structure of a molecule (using
Jmol47 and PyMol35), to analyze the quality of a structure (through the RMSD calculation
and the Ramachandran plot generated by Procheck46), and to adjust the protonation state (using PROPKA38). MolAr can generate the ROC curve and the AUC-ROC
of a given VS result to verify whether VS can separate two potential
compounds by pressing the ROC curve command from the Tools Menu.

Case Studies
The software described herein was evaluated
in two case studies developed in the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Laboratory
of the Federal University of São João del-Rei:I. Investigation of
the best in silico
model for DNA–ligand systems.

II. Evaluation of the CVS approach implemented
by MolAr.



In the following subsections,
we describe the above
case studies.

Investigation of the Best In Silico Model for DNA–Ligand
Systems
DNA is a common target in the treatment of several
genetic diseases, most notably cancer, due to its importance in the
cell cycle.68 However, drugs that interact
with DNA are often highly toxic due to the low selectivity between
the DNA of normal and abnormal cells; therefore, this strategy is
used a last resort, motivating the development of new drugs targeting
DNA.69

Molecular docking is widely
validated for protein–ligand systems, and despite recent works
that have used the method to model DNA–ligand complexes, there
is not yet a consensus regarding the best in silico model for nucleic
acids. DNA has several unique properties, such as a high charge density
and high flexibility.68 Holt et al.70 showed that molecular docking techniques can
be successfully extended to include nucleic acid targets. Other docking
studies have also been carried out on this topic. Evans and Neidle63 showed the utility of using DOCK and AutoDock software to
predict poses in DNA–ligand complexes. Ricci and Netz71 used AutoDock 4.0 to perform a docking study
using two ligands and four distinct DNA receptors. The authors demonstrated
that this approach could be used in DNA–ligand complexes because
the predicted binding mode corresponded to the experimentally suggested
mode. Fong and Wong72 evaluated four different
scoring functions (AutoDock, ASP@GOLD, ChemScore@GOLD, and GoldScore@GOLD)
for DNA–ligand complexes and concluded that DNA–ligand
complex evaluation using docking can obtain good results. Moreover,
they demonstrated that the use of more than one scoring function improves
the results. Srivastava et al.73 validated
the use of docking approaches and molecular dynamics in DNA–ligand
complexes. They presented a systematic computational analysis of 57
DNA ligands using four popular docking protocols (GOLD, Glide, CDOCKER,
and AutoDock) and concluded that the GOLD and Glide protocols were
very reliable when modeling nucleic acid–ligand complexes.

To compare recent in silico models of DNA–ligand systems,
MolAr was used to evaluate the different approaches used by AutoDock
Vina40 and DOCK 642 as well as the combination of these two (i.e., consensus virtual
screening, which intends to improve the reliability of VS results
by using a combination of results of different VS approaches). ROC
curve analysis was used to compare and validate these approaches.
The active compounds were selected from the research of Srivastava
et al.73 They were used to compare several
molecular docking approaches using 57 crystal structures of DNA–ligand
complexes with known minor groove binders as ligands.73 To perform our study, we selected the four most active
ligands from Srivastava et al.,73 the DNA
model related to them, and 50 decoys for each ligand that were obtained
using the DUD-E service.99 VS was performed
for 204 ligands (four active ligands and 200 decoys). The target was
1VZK (a thiophene-based diamidine that strongly binds the minor groove
at AT sites), which was the same as that used by Srivastava et al.73Figure 7 presents the 3D structure of the target 1VZK and the interaction
in 2D with its crystallographic ligand (D1B).

Figure 7 1VZK: (a) 3D structure
view. (b) Interactions in 2D.

Three virtual screenings were carried out: (1) Minimization of
the ligands with the MOPAC program followed by virtual screening with
AutoDock Vina, (2) virtual screening with DOCK 6, and (3) CVS between
approaches (1) and (2). The AUC-ROC was used to assess whether CVS
(DOCK 6 plus AutoDock Vina) could increase the reliability of the
docking.

Results of the Case Study to Find the Best In Silico Model for
DNA–Ligand Systems
All configurations resulted in
excellent AUC-ROC values (Figure 8), showing that AutoDock Vina, DOCK 6, and the consensus
docking approach proposed by MolAr were able to differentiate active
compounds from inactive compounds. An AUC-ROC greater than 0.7 means
that the software program was able to differentiate active ligands
from inactive ligands.24 In this case study,
the AUC-ROC values were 0.98, 0.88, and 0.99 for AutoDock Vina, DOCK
6, and CVS, respectively (Figure 8).

Figure 8 ROC curves obtained after performing VS with (a) AutoDock
Vina,
(b) DOCK 6, and (c) CVS.

The AUC values remained
consistent in all ROC curves. AutoDock
Vina (Figure 8a) showed
better results than DOCK 6 (Figure 8b), probably due to differences in the search algorithms
and scoring functions. The AutoDock Vina search algorithm relies on
random changes of conformation and is able to search outside of local
sites of minimum energy, while DOCK 6 uses an anchor-and-grow search
algorithm. In addition, AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6 use different scoring
functions. Scoring functions are the main reason for the failure or
success of docking tools because they are responsible for predicting
the binding affinity between a target and its candidate ligand.20 AutoDock Vina uses empirical scoring functions
to classify ligands, while DOCK 6 uses scoring functions based on
the force field to classify the compounds. These differences in scoring
function are probably the main reason for the best result being obtained
by AutoDock Vina.

CVS carries out VS using AutoDock Vina first
and then performs
a second VS using DOCK 6 as a refining step. The resulting ROC curve
of the CVS approach (Figure 8c) showed even better results for the AUC-ROC.

In addition
to the AUC-ROC, the enrichment factor (EF) was calculated
to verify the VS performance. Lätti, Niinivehmas, and Pentikäinen23 stated that using the AUC-ROC along with the
EF provide a good idea of the quality of the approach used to separate
true positives from false positives. The enrichment factor (EF) consists
of the number of active compounds found in relation to the number
of active compounds that would be found after a random search.74 EFs are often calculated against a given percentage
of the database. For example, EF10% represents the value obtained
when 10% of the database is screened. EFs can be defined by the following
formula:  

The EF results are
summarized in Table 1. DOCK 6 achieved EF1% = 25, EF2% = 12.5,
and EF5% = 15, while AutoDock Vina achieved 25, 25, and 15, and consensus
VS achieved 50, 25, and 20, respectively. These results show that
consensus VS has a clear advantage compared to DOCK 6 and AutoDock
Vina.

Table 1 Enrichment Factors for DOCK 6, AutoDock
Vina, and the Consensus between Them
EF	DOCK 6	AutoDock Vina	Consensus	
1%	25	25	50	
2%	12.5	25	25	
5%	15	15	20	
10%	7.5	7.5	10	
Finally, it is important to note that even
though DOCK 6 had, in
general, worse results than AutoDock Vina when considering the AUC-ROC,
this program contributed to improving the results (Table 2). For example, the position
of active ligands between all molecules in virtual screening can be
checked using DOCK 6, AutoDock Vina, and Consensus.

127d	–27.77	71th	–11.5	2th	2.76	7th	
In Table 2, the
active ligand with the highest energy according to DOCK 6 (127d) was
in position 71. In Octopus, the active ligand with the highest energy
was in position 21 (2dnd). In the consensus between them, the active
ligand with the highest energy was identified in position 8. The result
was improved with CVS because the active ligand with the highest energy
identified by DOCK 6 (127d) was the one with the lowest energy in
AutoDock Vina. The same was true for AutoDock Vina’s worst
active ligand (2dnd). In DOCK 6, it had the 10th lowest energy among
all ligands. Thus, when MolAr calculated the CVS between DOCK 6 and
AutoDock Vina, the result was improved.

It can be concluded
that even with DOCK 6 and AutoDock Vina showing
different results, the combination of these results may, in principle,
be closer to the true answer than that of only one of these programs
alone. When analyzing the AUC-ROC curves resulting from the CVS, the
result reliability was increased, giving a better prediction of the
active ligand positions.

Evaluation of the Consensus
Virtual Screening Approach Implemented
by MolAr
In CVS, MolAr uses the resulting ligand conformation
after docking with AutoDock Vina as input for DOCK 6. Thus, it is
expected that when starting from a ligand conformation already evaluated
and optimized by AutoDock Vina, DOCK 6 will achieve better results
still.

It was necessary to verify whether this approach would
have the opposite effect. Therefore, eight targets from the DUD database
were used, and 10 active ligands were selected for each target. The
DUD database contains a set of 102 targets and 22,886 active compounds
for these targets, with an average of 224 active ligands per target.
In the consensus setting, in addition to AutoDock Vina VS, a VS was
performed using DOCK 6 with Grid Score using amber. This choice promises
better results, as it performs some molecular dynamics simulations
during docking using DOCK 6; however, it leads to a much longer execution
time than GridScore flex without amber. In addition to performing
VS of the active ligands, it was necessary to generate decoys for
the chosen ligands to carry out VS and plot the ROC curves.

Thus, a subset of the DUD38 targets was selected. DUD38 is a subset
of DUD that can be subdivided into six target families: metalloenzymes
(4), nuclear hormone receptors (8), kinases (9), folate enzymes (2),
serine proteases (2), and a diverse family called other enzymes (13).
We used a total of eight targets to perform the evaluation. For each
target, we selected 10 active ligands, and we used DUD to generate
50 decoys for each ligand. The VS was performed for 510 ligands for
each one of the eight targets (10 active ligands and 500 decoys).
The ligands were different for each target and were taken from DUD-E.
The targets were chosen primarily by considering their resolution
in the PDB. Homology modeling was performed to reconstruct gap regions
(such as loop regions) for all chosen targets. Table 3 lists the chosen targets, and Chart 1 shows the interactions of crystallographic
ligands with the targets used in this case study.

other	1XL2 (HIV-1 protease in complex with pyrrolidinmethanamine)	
After choosing the
targets, it was necessary to choose which active
ligands would be used for each target. We then used MolAr to perform
virtual screening using AutoDock Vina for each of the chosen targets
and for all DUD active ligands for each target. The 10 active ligands
with the best energy were chosen for each target. This preselection
of active ligands was necessary because it is impracticable to perform
VS in the chosen configuration for all active ligands of each target
and their respective decoys to generate the ROC curve since we performed
molecular dynamics simulations (3000 steps) using the amber score
scoring function in the consensus experiments. The results were improved
by considering the ligand movement in molecular dynamics steps during
the docking process. Consequently, the computational cost of execution
was much longer than when using a scoring function that does not perform
the dynamics, such as the grid score. Because AutoDock Vina had a
shorter runtime than DOCK 6, it was chosen to perform these tests
(in general, for the selected targets, this step required approximately
1 day for each).

CVS was performed for all targets, and another
VS using only DOCK
6 was carried out to compare the influence of using the AutoDock Vina
output as input for DOCK 6; the results obtained by DOCK 6 used the
original ligands and their decoys. On average, due to the configuration
chosen for the tests, the CVS for each target required 2 weeks to
be performed. Some targets, such as metalloenzymes, VS took up to
30 days for VS of a single target.

Results of the Case Study Evaluating the
CVS Approach Implemented
by MolAr
In this experiment, we performed CVS and VS using
only DOCK 6 to compare the performance of DOCK 6 using the final ligand
conformations defined by AutoDock Vina with the performance of DOCK
6 using the original conformations.

There was an improvement
in the ROC curve of up to 42% (3BKL protein) when using the CVS approach,
which demonstrates that it can lead to significant gains. The table
above shows the results of the experiments performed, and except for
the 3KBA protein, there was an improvement in the ROC curve when executing
DOCK 6 based on the final ligand conformation defined by AutoDock
Vina compared to the execution of DOCK 6 using the original ligand
conformation. The 3KBA protein showed the same AUC-ROC in both scenarios. Table 4 summarizes the results.

folate enzyme	3NX0	0.63	0.80	27	
serine protease	2AYW	0.90	0.95	6	
other enzymes	1XL2	0.63	0.76	21	
These data show that the CVS approach increases the
reliability
of the tests performed by DOCK 6; according to the value of the AUC-ROC,
this approach tends to decrease the number of false negatives identified
by DOCK 6.

The EF results are summarized in Table 5. Regarding the targets 2QD9,
2AM9, and 3KBA,
the AUC-ROC in the best case (DOCK 6 after AutoDock Vina) was less
than 0.7, and the EF values were 0. An AUC-ROC of less than 0.7 means
that the software program was not able to differentiate active ligands
from inactive ligands.24 The AUC-ROC and
EF values of these proteins are consistent as they indicate that there
was no improvement over a random choice of elements. In the experiments
of the other five targets (1H00, 3BKL, 3NX0, 2AYW, and 1XL2), the
EF values indicated that the consensus approach in which DOCK 6 uses
the selected conformations provided by AutoDock Vina improved the
DOCK 6 performance for four of them (1H00, 3BKL, 3NX0, and 2AYW).
For target 1XL2, the consensus approach gave the same EF values as
was obtained by DOCK 6. Interestingly, the 3BKL protein is a metalloprotein,
and the metal (zinc) is in the binding site. A recent study demonstrated
that DOCK 6 failed in these situations.75 However, in the study by Çınaroǧlu and Timuçin,75 the scoring function used was the grid score.
In the current paper, the AMBER scoring function was used in consensus
docking between AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6. The force field FF09 used
by the AMBER scoring function was parameterized for zinc ions.76 We were able to achieve good results (AUC-ROC
of 0.81), which could be a starting point for further studies to verify
whether this improvement can be reproduced for other metalloproteins.

Conclusions
This paper presents MolAr, a new software program that aims to
assist in the VS process. One of the main contributions of our work
is the development of software that is composed of several integrated
tools to facilitate the VS process. MolAr automates the VS process,
minimizing the need for human interference and thereby reducing the
chances of error. MolAr allows researchers to perform docking, and
the program is easy to use and does not require advanced computing
knowledge. A new consensus virtual screening approach between DOCK
6 and AutoDock Vina has been developed, allowing the user to easily
perform this task. The software programs used by MolAr to perform
VS are all free for academic use.

Finally, two case studies
were performed with MolAr. The first
case investigated the use of virtual screening in DNA–ligand
systems. The results demonstrated that both AutoDock Vina and DOCK
6 presented good reliability when considering the AUC-ROC values.
Furthermore, although the results were excellent, the CVS approach
further increased the reliability of VS. The combined approach increased
the reliability of the AUC-ROC values compared with applying the VS
tools separately. The identification of active ligands was also improved.
AutoDock Vina, which identified active ligands better than DOCK 6
when performing VS, identified all active ligands in the top 22, while
in the CVS approach used by MolAr, all active ligands were identified
in the top 8. Notably, using MolAr to perform CVS has the advantage
that MolAr carries out the CVS process automatically. Thus, the user
does not have to worry about the various steps required to perform
CVS between AutoDock Vina and DOCK 6, such as preparing the ligands,
converting the output generated by AutoDock Vina to the DOCK 6 format,
and comparing the results generated by the two tools (which can be
difficult because they are in different units). The final case study
validated the CVS strategy implemented by MolAr, where AutoDock Vina
is executed first, and the resulting ligand conformations are used
as input for the VS carried out by DOCK 6. This strategy improved
the AUC values by up to 42%. Thus, the use of the final conformation
determined by AutoDock Vina as input for the virtual screening performed
by DOCK 6 is a good strategy to improve the reliability of the screening
performed by DOCK 6.

This study demonstrated that MolAr was
able to not only perform
in silico simulations correctly but also could achieve satisfactory
results. MolAr automates the installation of the many software programs
required in the virtual screening process, contributing to the reduction
of time and errors that may occur. MolAr represents a promising framework,
with easy-to-use interfaces, and eliminates the need to use multiple
command-line programs. MolAr has Linux and Windows versions, and it
is freely available for download at http://www.drugdiscovery.com.br/.

Additional features will be added to MolAr in the future,
including
the implementation of artificial intelligence techniques; binding
site prediction; ab initio prediction methods for use in homology
modeling; molecular dynamics simulations; automation of other validation
methods, such as enrichment factors and BedROC;77 generation of ligand tautomers for use in VS simulations;
and the addition of other open-source virtual screening tools.
