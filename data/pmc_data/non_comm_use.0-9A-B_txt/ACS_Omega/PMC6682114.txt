We report the site-specific
and covalent bioconjugation of fluorescent
polymer chains to proteins in live cells using the HaloTag technology.
Polymer chains bearing a Halo-ligand precisely located at their α-chain-end
were synthesized in a controlled manner owing to the RAFT polymerization
process. They were labeled in lateral position by several organic
fluorophores such as AlexaFluor 647. The resulting Halo-ligand polymer
probe was finally shown to selectively recognize and label HaloTag
proteins present at the membrane of live cells using confocal fluorescence
microscopy. Such a polymer bioconjugation approach holds great promises
for various applications ranging from cell imaging to cell surface
functionalization.

Introduction
Fluorescence microscopy
is a powerful technique that is widely
used to image living organisms and better understand cell functions
and the associated biomolecular processes. This requires engineered
fluorescent probes able to specifically label biomolecules such as
proteins in their natural environment. Of particular interest is the
study of protein dynamics and interactions at the membrane of live
cells that often relies on exogenous probes.1 Several parameters have to be taken into account considering that
the constraints of live cell imaging differ from those of in vitro
studies.2 Techniques relying on the labeling
of isolated proteins are indeed hardly transposable as they require
the fluorescently labeled protein to be injected after re-purification
using methods such as microinjection or electroporation.3 For live cell imaging, less invasive methods
are usually preferred, but the challenge is to obtain a selective
labeling of the target proteins.

The fluorescent probe needs
to adequately fulfill a fine compromise
between physicochemical, photophysical, and biological properties.
First, it should be water-soluble, should show adequate diffusion
properties, and should not be toxic. Moreover, it should be highly
bright in the selected wavelength range together with a rather small
size and exhibit good photostability (e.g., resistance to photobleaching).
In addition, in live cell conditions, the fluorescent probe should
promote a very efficient and specific labeling of the target protein.

Recently, we have developed a new family of tunable fluorescent
polymer probes that presents many interesting properties.4 These probes are highly water-soluble and biocompatible,
highly bright, and resistant to photobleaching.4c The polymer chain size can be controlled owing to the RAFT
polymerization process. In addition, we have already shown that such
polymer chains can be functionalized at their chain end to promote
an oriented conjugation onto native proteins5 or histidine-tagged proteins in vitro via a nitrilotriacetic acid
(NTA) ligand.6

Considering these
properties, the objective of the present study
was to design new fluorescent polymer probes that covalently and selectively
label proteins in live cell conditions. We chose the HaloTag technology,7 which is particularly well suited for in vivo
labeling.8 Based on the use of a modified
haloalkane dehalogenase protein tag (HaloTag), this strategy allows
the covalent and site-specific conjugation of synthetic haloalkane
ligands (Halo-ligands) onto the protein of interest (fused with the
HaloTag). This irreversible and specific coupling has recently drawn
much attention for the purification of proteins with high yield and
efficiency,9 for the grafting of proteins
onto various surfaces,7a,10 and for protein labeling with
small-molecule ligands.7a,11 During the preparation
of this manuscript, Liu et al. reported on this strategy to engineer
cancer cells with glycopolymers for immunotherapy.12 To the best of our knowledge, no fluorescent polymer probes
have been developed for the direct observation of HaloTag proteins
in live cells by fluorescence microscopy. Our aim was thus to functionalize
fluorescent polymer chains with the Halo-ligand and evaluate their
ability to specifically and selectively label HaloTag proteins in
live cell conditions (Figure 1).

polymer probe (Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647) with a HaloTag protein

Results and Discussion
Halo-ligand-terminated polymer chains
were synthesized by RAFT
controlled radical polymerization via a new RAFT chain transfer agent
(CTA) functionalized with the Halo-ligand (Halo-CTA; Figure 2A). Indeed, we already showed
that the use of functionalized CTAs is a highly efficient strategy
to introduce entities of interest at the α-chain-end of polymer
chains.6,13 An amino-modified Halo-ligand with a tetra(oligoethylene
glycol) spacer was first reacted with a precursor RAFT agent (bearing
an activated ester function) developed in our laboratory.13b We chose this spacer to better separate the
polymer chain bearing the fluorophores and the haloalkane moiety that
should efficiently enter and react inside the HaloTag binding pocket
of the recombinant protein. The expected Halo-CTA (Figure 2A) was successfully obtained
(75% yield after purification) as confirmed by 1H NMR and
high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 2 Structures of the (A) Halo-ligand-functionalized
RAFT chain transfer
agent (Halo-CTA) and the Halo-ligand chain-end-functionalized (B)
homopolymer and (C) reactive copolymer synthesized in this study.

The Halo-CTA was then used to
control radical homo- and copolymerizations
via the RAFT process. Homopolymerization of N-acryloylmorpholine
(NAM) was first performed following a previously optimized procedure.14 A low-molecular-weight poly(N-acryloylmorpholine) (PNAM; Figure 2B) sample was purposely synthesized to precisely investigate
chain-end functionalization by 1H NMR and matrix-assisted
laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
MS) analyses (after efficient purification of the polymer sample by
precipitation in diethyl ether).

The 1H NMR spectrum
(Figure 3, left) exhibited
the broad peaks corresponding
to NAM repeating units and the expected chains ends. Dithiobenzoate
(DB) ω-end-group protons gave three characteristic peaks between
7.3 and 8 ppm and a −CH–S peak at 5.1 ppm (denoted a′).
Protons of the Halo-ligand α-end-group were superimposed to
the polymer peaks but distinguishable. Oligoethylene glycol and haloalkane
protons were superimposed with morpholine protons between 3 and 4
ppm and backbone methylene protons between 1 and 2 ppm. Integration
of DB chain-end protons could be used to determine the number-average
molecular weight (Mn) of the polymer sample.
The NMR Mn value (3700 g mol–1) was in good agreement with the expected one (3560 g mol–1) calculated from eq 1.

conversion, Mn,NMR = 3700 g·mol–1). (Left) 1NMR spectrum in CDCl3. (Right) MALDI-TOF mass spectrum in the positive reflectron mode.
(A) Full spectrum. (B) Enlargement showing monoisotopic peaks (inset:
theoretical isotopic pattern).

These results were further confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS analysis
of
the same sample (Figure 3, right). The polymer distribution centered on 3500 m/z and spanning from ca. 1500 to 7000 m/z was composed
of a series of peaks spaced by one NAM repetitive unit (ca. 141 m/z).
Positive reflectron mode analysis revealed the presence of the expected
Halo-ligand-PNAM-DB chains. For instance, for DP = 15, theoretical
monoisotopic mass for [C17H33O5NCl(C7H11NO2)15C7H5S2 + Na+], C129H203S2N16O35ClNa: 2658.4 m/z; found: 2658.6 m/z. The isotopic distribution (impacted by the presence of sulfur and
chlorine atoms) is in good agreement with the expected one (inset
in Figure 3B, right).
The additional major populations corresponded to the K+ cationization of the expected product and the usual side products
formed inside the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer during the analysis
of dithiobenzoate-terminated chains.15 Indeed,
we showed, in a previous study, that fragmentation of the dithiobenzoate
ω-chain-end occurs due to the weakness of the carbon–dithiobenzoate
C–S bond.16 The main side product
was clearly identified as Halo-ligand-PNAM-H chains terminated by
a proton. Theoretical monoisotopic mass for [C17H33O5NCl(C7H11NO2)16H + Na+], C129H210N17O37ClNa: 2647.5 m/z;
found: 2647.6 m/z.

Altogether,
NMR and MALDI-TOF MS analyses demonstrated that the
RAFT homopolymerization of NAM with the new Halo-CTA is characterized
by good control over molecular weights and chain-end functionalization.
Importantly, MALDI-TOF MS analyses demonstrated that the Halo-ligand
moiety at the polymer α-chain-end is retained intact after polymerization
(and purification).

The Halo-CTA was then used to control the
copolymerization of NAM
with N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS) at a 60:40 molar
ratio (Figure 2C).
We indeed showed that this is an azeotropic composition for this particular
co-monomer pair, leading to poly(NAM-stat-NAS) copolymers with regularly
distributed activated ester groups along the polymer backbone.17

Polymerization kinetics was followed by 1H NMR (see Methods). A 90% monomer
conversion was obtained
in less than 2 h (Figure 4, left) with an induction period shorter than 15 min.18 These results were fully consistent with previous
copolymerizations performed with other RAFT control agents such as tert-butyl dithiobenzoate.17 NAM
and NAS individual conversions were identical at all time points,
confirming the azeotropic conditions.

the presence of the Halo-CTA.
(Left) Monomer consumption kinetics. (Right) Evolution of experimental Mn and dispersity (Đ)
values with conversion.

Experimental Mn values determined
by
both 1H NMR and SEC/MALLS analyses of purified polymer
samples were in good agreement and also correlated with the calculated Mn values from eq 1 (Figure 4, right). Dispersity remained very low (Đ <
1.1), as expected for well-controlled RAFT polymerization.

In
a last synthetic step, fluorescent labeling of polymer chains
bearing the Halo-ligand at the α-chain-end (Figure 5D) could be carried out following
our previously reported procedure.5 We
chose AlexaFluor 647 fluorophore (AF647), which is a very convenient
far-red dye for in cellulo studies and especially well adapted to
dSTORM super-resolution microscopy.19 A
Halo-ligand-poly(NAM-stat-NAS) copolymer sample (Mn = 10 600 g mol–1; Đ = 1.04) was first reacted with amino-modified AF647. The average
number of AF647 fluorophores per polymer chain, nf, was controlled by stoichiometry, such coupling reaction
leading to a very high yield (>95%) at room temperature. Here,
we
aimed at four AF647 fluorophores per polymer chain, and the actual
value determined experimentally by SEC/UV4a was nf = 4.0, confirming that dye coupling
onto the lateral activated esters of the polymer backbone is much
faster than the concurrent aminolysis of the dithiobenzoate ω-chain-end.13b After capping the residual activated ester
functions of the copolymer with aminoethylmorpholine (AEM), the resulting
fluorescent polymer probe (Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647) was purified
by dialysis and lyophilized (Mn = 14,400
g mol–1). It is worth noting that this capping procedure
also leads to the aminolysis of the polymer dithiobenzoate ω-chain-end
that may represent a source of nonspecific interaction in live cells
and cytotoxicity.20

Figure 5 Synthesis of  (D)
the Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647 fluorescent
polymer probe from (C) the well-defined reactive copolymer precursor.

The Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647
probe was finally assessed
for its ability to efficiently label HaloTag fusion proteins in live
cell conditions. Our objective was to investigate whether our polymer
probe leads to (i) a selective labeling of HaloTag proteins (Figure 1) and (ii) the absence
of nonspecific cell labeling. As our polymer probe is fluorescent,
this study could be performed in a straightforward manner using confocal
fluorescence microscopy after a simple incubation of the probe with
cells.

As we previously reported that such polymer probes bearing
AF647
fluorophores (but without the Halo-ligand) were not cell permeant,5 this study was conducted with HeLa S3 cells engineered21 to express the HaloTag at the cell surface with
a GPI-anchor (Halo-GPI cells) (see Methods). Expression of the HaloTag transgene in the Halo-GPI cells was
either induced with 50 nM doxycycline (Dox) for 48 h or not induced
(negative control) followed by incubation with two types of fluorescent
probes. Our Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647 probe was compared with
a commercial non-cell permeant Halo-ligand labeled with a molecular
dye (HaloTag AlexaFluor 488, Promega; Figure S5).

When the HaloTag expression was Dox-induced, confocal microscopy
images showed that the two fluorescent probes nicely labeled the cell
surface, however with a much brighter signal for the polymer probe
(Figure 6, middle and
bottom panels). In addition, still in the presence of the fluorescent
polymer probe, the absence of a fluorescent signal when HaloTag expression
was not induced (Figure 6, top panels) highlighted the specificity of the interaction. Similar
to the commercial probe, the fluorescent polymer probe did not cause
a significant background signal in the absence of HaloTag. The probe
did not label the cell membrane or other cell compartments in a nonspecific
manner.

Figure 6 Confocal fluorescence microscopy: HeLa S3 cells were incubated
for 2 h with the Halo-ligand probes, HaloTag AlexaFluor 488 (0.05
μM), or Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647 probe (0.5 μM),
as indicated. HeLa S3 cells were not induced (without doxycycline)
(top panels) or induced (with doxycycline) (middle panels) to express
the Halo-GPI transgene. Scale bars = 10 μm. Lower panels are
zoom-in images of the middle panels.

This study thus shows that the synthesized fluorescent polymer
probe bearing a Halo-ligand chain-end very selectively and efficiently
recognizes the HaloTag in live cells. A very bright labeling of proteins
expressing the HaloTag at the cell membrane was observed by confocal
fluorescence microscopy, while there was no nonspecific labeling in
the absence of the HaloTag. Such polymer–protein conjugation
is covalent and site-specific and ensures that only one polymer chain
is bound per protein. This attractive approach thus holds great promise
in applications ranging from cell surface functionalization to cell
imaging. In particular, Halo-ligand–polymer fluorescent probes
may be especially useful in the field of super-resolution light microscopy.

Methods
Materials
N-Acryloyl morpholine (NAM)
(Aldrich, 97%) was distilled under reduced pressure (120 °C;
10 mm Hg) to remove the inhibitor. N-Acryloxysuccinimide
(NAS) was synthesized as previously described.22 2,2′-Azobis(isobutyronitrile) (AIBN) (Fluka, 98%)
was purified by recrystallization from ethanol. 1,4-Dioxane (Acros,
99%) was distilled over LiAlH4 (110 °C). Succinimidoxycarbonylethyl
dithiobenzoate (SEDB) was synthesized and purified according to a
previously published protocol.13a Trioxane
(Acros, 99%), diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA; Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.5%),
4-(2-aminoethyl)morpholine (AEM; Aldrich, 99%), AlexaFluor 647 cadaverine
(AF647, Life Technologies), HaloTag amine (O4) ligand (Halo-ligand-NH2, Promega, France), HaloTag AlexaFluor 488 (Promega), anhydrous
dimethylformamide (DMF, Fisher Scientific, 99.99%), pentane (Fisher
Scientific), ethyl acetate (Fisher Scientific), silica gel (Sigma-Aldrich),
MgSO4 (Sigma-Aldrich), and chloroform (Fisher Scientific)
were used as received.

Analytical Techniques
SEC/MALLS
Size
exclusion chromatography with multi-angle
laser light scattering detection (SEC/MALLS) was performed with a
Mixed-C PLgel column (5 μm pore size) and an LC-6A Shimadzu
liquid pump (1 mL min–1). Online double detection
was provided by a differential refractometer (Waters DRI 410) and
a MiniDAWN TREOS three-angle (46°, 90°, 133°) light
scattering detector (Wyatt Technologies) operating at 658 nm. Analyses
were run by injection of chloroform polymer solutions (3 g L–1, 70 μL). The specific refractive index increment (dn/dc) of the polymers in chloroform (0.130
mL g–1) was previously determined with an NFT-ScanRef
interferometer operating at 633 nm. The molecular weight distribution
data were obtained via the Wyatt ASTRA SEC/LS software package.

1H NMR
Spectra were acquired at 300 K on
a Bruker Ultrashield spectrometer operating at 300.13 MHz.

Matrix-Assisted
Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS)
Mass spectra were acquired in
the reflectron mode using a Voyager-DE PRO (AB Sciex, Framingham,
MA) equipped with a nitrogen laser emitting at 337 nm. Ions were accelerated
to a 20 kV final potential. Positive ions were detected, and mass
spectra were a sum of 300 shots. External mass calibration was provided
by a mixture of peptides (Sequazyme standards kit, AB Sciex). Samples
were prepared by dissolving polymers in THF at a 10 g L–1concentration. The matrix, 3-indoleacrylic acid (IAA; Sigma-Aldrich,
used without further purification), was dissolved in THF at 0.25 M.
Matrix and polymer solutions were mixed at a 9:1 (v/v) ratio, and
then 1 μL of the mixture was deposited and dried onto the MALDI
sample plate.

Synthesis of the Halo-Ligand-Functionalized
CTA (Halo-CTA)
To a chloroform solution (0.8 mL) of SEDB
(35.2 mg, purity of >93%,
103 μmol, 1.2 equiv), a chloroform solution (1.4 mL) of Halo-ligand-NH2 (86 μmol, 1 equiv) and then DIPEA (30.2 μL, 172
μmol, 2 equiv) was added. The mixture was placed under magnetic
stirring at room temperature for 4 h. The orange reaction medium was
then diluted with 10 mL of chloroform and the product adsorbed on
6 g of silica gel. After three washes with 20 mL of chloroform and
three washes with 20 mL of pentane, the product was recovered with
3 × 50 mL of ethyl acetate. The organic solution was washed with
2 × 250 mL of water, 250 mL of a pH 10 NaOH aqueous solution,
and 250 mL of a saturated NaCl aqueous solution, with 2 × 250
mL of deionized water, dried over MgSO4, and evaporated.
The final product (red oil) was finally dried under vacuum (yield,
75%).

RAFT Polymerizations
RAFT polymerization protocols
were adapted from previously optimized procedures.14,17

Halo-Ligand-PNAM-DB Homopolymers
NAM (1.50 mmol), Halo-CTA
(16.3 μmol), AIBN (2.8 μmol), trioxane (0.13 mmol) (internal
reference determination of monomer conversion), and dioxane (0.56
mL) were mixed in a Schlenk tube equipped with a magnetic stirrer.
The solution was degassed by five freeze–evacuate–thaw
cycles before heating at 80 °C under nitrogen in a thermostated
oil bath.

Halo-Ligand-P(NAM-stat-NAS)
Copolymers
Statistical copolymerization of NAM and NAS monomers
followed the
same procedure, starting with NAM (2.17 mmol), NAS (1.45 mmol), Halo-CTA
(27.8 μmol), AIBN (9.61 μmol), trioxane (0.18 mmol), and
dioxane (1.54 mL). Samples were occasionally withdrawn from the polymerization
medium via a cannula for analyses.

In both cases, individual
monomer conversions were determined by 1H NMR following
the decrease in the NAM and NAS vinyl protons in comparison with the
trioxane singlet.22 The spectrum acquired
at t0 before heating up the reaction mixture
allowed us to precisely quantify the monomer/RAFT agent ratio and
thus calculate the expected molecular weight of the polymer sample
at 100% conversion using eq 1.17 1  where [NAM]0 and MNAM (141.17 g mol–1) are the
initial
molar concentration and the molecular weight of the NAM monomer, respectively,
[NAS]0 and MNAS (169.13 g mol–1) are the initial molar concentration and the molecular weight of
the NAS monomer, respectively, ConvNAM and ConvNAS are the NAM and NAS conversions at time t, respectively,
and [CTA]0 and MCTA (520.15 g mol–1) are the initial molar concentration and the molecular weight of
the Halo-CTA, respectively.

After the synthesis, polymers were
purified by precipitation in
diethyl ether and dried under vacuum up to a constant weight.

Synthesis of the Fluorescent Polymer Probe (Halo-Ligand–Polymer-AF647)
Halo-ligand-P(NAM-stat-NAS)-DB (Mn = 10 600 g mol–1, Đ = 1.04; 0.47 μmol, 1 equiv) and AF647 (1.89 μmol, 4
equiv) were dissolved in DMF (0.25 mL). DIPEA (3.77 μmol, 8
equiv) was subsequently added, and the blue solution was stirred for
2 h at room temperature. AEM (56.6 μmol, 3 equiv per NAS unit)
was then added, and the reaction was left for another 2 h under stirring
at room temperature. The resulting polymer Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647
was purified by dialysis (2 kDa MWCO, SpectraPor) and finally dried
by lyophilization.

HaloTag Expressing Cells
A reverse
tetracycline (Tet)-dependent
transactivator (rtTA) cassette,23 under
the control of a bidirectional promoter with ΔLNGFR in the reverse
orientation for selection purposes,21a in
a lentiviral vector was employed to render cells Tet (and thus Dox)-responsive.
Transgene cassettes were genomically integrated in a subsequent manner
into HeLa S3 cells by lentiviral delivery, essentially as described.21a Cells with genomic integrations of transgenes,
of which the genotype was confirmed by PCR single-locus technology,
were cloned by limiting dilution, as described,21b to yield the cell lines used in this study, inducibly expressing
HALO-GPI.

The HALO-GPI cassette was created by replacing GFP
with the HaloTag in a previously described24 construct with the vitronectin signal sequence at the N-terminus
and the C-terminus, the C-terminal portion of human uPAR, which, upon
expression, is removed from the protein construct to be replaced by
a GPI anchor.

Cell Culture
Hela S3 cells were
cultured in DMEM (Thermo
Fischer Scientific, Monza, Italy) containing glutamax (1 mM), 5% Tet-System-approved
fetal bovine serum (FBS, Takara, Jesi, Italy), 100 U mL–1 penicillin, and 100 mg mL–1 streptomycin. Cells
were routinely tested (on a monthly basis) and found to be mycoplasm-free
by the use of a standard diagnostic PCR. Expression of transgenes
was induced with Dox at the indicated concentrations.

Confocal Fluorescence
Microscopy
After incubation with
the Halo-ligand probes, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for
10 min at room temperature and washed in PBS. Nuclei were stained
with Hoechst diluted in PBS for 10 min at room temperature in the
dark. After washing in PBS, coverslips were mounted on microscope
glass slides with Mowiol. Light microscopy images were acquired at
the UltraView spinning disk confocal microscope operated by Volocity
software (PerkinElmer), essentially as described.21b A ×63 objective was used. HaloTag AlexaFluor 488 and
Halo-ligand–polymer-AF647 were excited with the 488 and 640
nm laser lines, respectively.
