Oxides containing Ga have been studied
by various research communities
due to their stability under harsh conditions as well as conductivity
and luminescence properties. Nanostructured forms of such oxides can
be fabricated by a variety of methods. Advances in synthesis approaches
have focused on control over size and shape that can permit adaptation
in applied interfaces related to medicine, energy, and the environment.
Chemical functionalization can enhance the stability of nanostructured
oxides containing Ga in aqueous solutions. In this prospective, we
summarize progress in making these materials as well as functionalizing
them in water solutions. The prospective also identifies future opportunities

I Introduction
Prior to this decade, Ga containing materials have been predominantly
used in microelectronics. For instance, the optoelectronics community
is currently addressing the need to produce single crystal Ga2O3 with specific characteristics (i.e., p-type
doping and improved thermal conductivity) that are essential for fabricating
devices for power electronics.1 However,
advances in the synthesis of nanostructured Ga-based oxide materials
has expanded their utility.2,3 Currently, there is
an emphasis on understanding their properties in the context of catalysis,4 sensors,5 and biomedical
modalities,6 such as targeted drug delivery,
chemo/thermal/photodynamic therapy, and in vivo imaging. Properties
of particular interest include unique conductivity7 and photoluminescence.8 Additionally,
these nanostructured oxides are often incorporated into specific processing
where cost-effective, large scale production is essential along with
chemical and thermal stabilities over broad ranges and conditions9 as well as high transparency and tunable luminescence.

The potential applications of these materials have prompted a number
of efforts to improve the materials’ synthesis using several
general routes, Table 1. Ga-based oxides have been primarily studied in two forms: Ga2O3 and GaOOH. Recent work has focused on controlling
their size, aspect ratio, as well as processing-based parameters,
such as the use or elimination of surfactant during synthesis in the
solution. The prospective will focus on the challenges and opportunities
associated with not only making these materials but also further modifying
them via chemical functionalization.10 Additional
surface chemistry on Ga2O3 and GaOOH can improve
their stability in aqueous solutions.11 However, surface passivation is not the only motivation for the
development of surface chemistry routes to alter them. Additional
optical properties that can change include photoluminescence12 and persistent photoluminescence.13

There are unique materials chemistry
aspects that one needs to
consider in tailoring the properties of Ga2O3 and GaOOH in aqueous-based applications. For example, as-synthesized
Ga2O3 and GaOOH are negatively charged, and
their surface can readily be coronated by proteins when introduced
into the conditions associated with in vitro or in vivo studies. Furthermore,
already modified Ga2O3 and GaOOH nanostructured
particles can experience dissociation of weakly bound ligands in aqueous
solutions under different temperatures and pHs. This dissociation
can lead to agglomeration, alter desired properties, and lead to irreproducibility
during processing procedures. Combined computational and experimental
studies have highlighted the importance of surface structure and reactivity
of the oxide surface with respect to stability of specific ligand
attachment in water.14 This prospective
will appeal to a wide audience due to the emerging use in Ga2O3 and GaOOH in many fields where low inorganic materials’
toxicity and preparation in environmentally friendly solvents such
as water is desired. We summarize current efforts to improve the utility
of Ga containing oxides in aqueous solutions to achieve desired stability
as well as optical characteristics that are needed in areas ranging
from environmental monitoring in extremely harsh environments to solution-based
biochemical sensors.

II Synthesis of Ga Containing
Oxides
Table 1 summarizes
representative examples of Ga containing oxides that have been reported
in the literature. In several instances, these oxides are subsequently
converted to other products (i.e., GaN). A few of the synthesis methods
offer specific advantages when adapting Ga containing oxides for aqueous-based
applications. A number of reports describe solution-based techniques
resulting in Ga containing nanostructured materials. Examples include
microemulsion, sol–gel, hydrothermal, and ultrasonic-assisted
fabrication. Furthermore, researchers have performed the hydrothermal
synthesis under microwave radiation in an effort to improve final
yield while reducing reaction times. Column 2 of Table 1 identifies metal nitrate salts
as one of the more commonly used precursors to make these materials.
The formation of the final materials proceeds in two steps where a
hydrolysis of the salt results in the formation of a metal hydroxide.
Subsequently, the hydroxide is dehydrated, a precipitate is observed,
and further drying yields the metal oxide. The two reactions are summarized,
as described by Hayashi et al.15 1   2  Surfactant molecules have also been utilized
during the synthesis of these materials. During this process, the
surfactant is used together with a stabilizer often referred to as
an emulsifier. The molecule chosen as a stabilizer has a polar head
group and nonpolar tail. During the synthesis of the Ga containing
oxides, the surfactant, and emulsifier are mixed together with the
metal salt precursors. As the mixture is formed, the emulsifier is
using its nonpolar tail to face toward the surfactant, whereas its
polar head group orients toward the aqueous solution containing the
precursor materials. During this process, the size and shape of the
Ga containing oxide are controlled by the emulsifier which is around
the reaction solution where the product crystallizes.

Another
methodology used to control the size of Ga containing particles
is via a sol–gel where a polymerization reaction takes place.
The chosen precursor materials identified in Table 1 form gels through a hydrolysis reaction.
One can tune the size of the particles by controlling the rate of
the hydrolysis reaction in addition to any condensation that might
take place. A draw-back of this methodology is the need to remove
solvents by calcination which requires elevated temperatures. A methodology
that does not require any additional heat or pressure is the sonochemical
route where chemical reactions are initiated by ultrasonic radiation.
The use of ultrasound promotes the formation of bubbles in the solution
which continue to grow until they collapse. These bubbles are thought
to produce extremely high temperatures during the process of their
collapse which are then rapidly cooled back to the ambient solution
temperature.

By far, the most widely used route to make Ga containing
oxides
in a number of papers is the traditional hydrothermal synthesis technique
where a solution of precursors is sealed and placed into an autoclave.
The reaction can take up to 24 h. However, if one replaces the autoclave
with a microwave, these reactions can be done in less than an hour.
Additional advantages include is the elimination of the need for a
surfactant and the use of deionized water as a solvent. Literature
sources cite the reduced reaction time as the key advantage of the
microwave synthesis.

Many of the summarized synthetic methods
have focused on controlling
shape and size. Table 2 lists the ranges of sizes and examples of shapes reported in the
literature. The use of general terms such as “base”
or “weak base” is intended to denote that a wide range
of chemicals can be used to perform the synthesis. The Ga containing
oxide particles dimensions and geometrical variations have been linked
to specific properties quantified by a wealth of analytical techniques
listed in the last column of the table. In addition to control the
over surface to volume ratios, size and shape have been linked to
a number of anisotropy-dependent properties. Ga containing oxides
can adapt different shapes during the different synthesis steps and
show shape-dependent stability in aqueous solutions. Differences in
stability are particularly noteworthy in complex biological solutions
where release of Ga ions can lead to variable physiological responses
of cells.16 In addition to stability, the
thermal, spectral, and photocatalytic properties of Ga containing
nanostructure are also size and shape dependent.17 β-Ga2O3 nanobelts obtained
via mechanical exfoliation under room temperature and humidity conditions
have been incorporated into devices that show remarkable radiation
tolerance.18 Many of the spectroscopic
studies summarized in Table 2 have examined the role of water hydrogen bonded to the Ga2O3- and GaOOH-nanostructured materials. Infrared
bands associated with bonding to hydroxyl units are reported to be
sensitive to synthesis conditions.19 Additional
spectroscopic studies have concluded that the luminescence of these
materials is nanocrystalline size dependent, and the location of the
emission peak is in the blue-green region.20 The intensity and the broadness of the emission peak of Ga containing
oxides are not altered in aqueous solutions, and its after-glow or
persistent luminescent properties are showing promise in preclinical
in vitro and in vivo imaging studies.21

III Chemical Functionalization of Ga Containing
Oxides in Aqueous Solutions
Chemical functionalization not
only improves the stability of Ga
containing oxides in aqueous solutions but can also add to their functionality
by tailoring properties such as emission and chemical recognition.22 Certain surface planes have been shown to be
more stable than others as is the case for β-Ga2O3(100)-B which can lead to difficulties in the development
of successful functionalization routes.14 In many instances, the hydroxide groups present on the surface have
proven effective moieties for the covalent modification of the surface
with a number of moieties. Typical adsorbates considered in the literature
include thiols, alcohols, carboxylic acid, and phosphonic acid derivatives.
Some of these adsorbates can engage in various modes of binding to
the Ga oxide containing surface, Figure 1. The desired chemisorption can be accomplished
ex situ by taking the already made nanostructured Ga containing oxide
and exposing it to the chosen adsorbate.23 Procedures can focus on tuning incubation times, temperature, and
ligand concentration. The mode of binding of each type of adsorbate
is dependent on what type of surface structure is energetically more
favorable, though experimental results report observations of multiple
modes of binding with specific ligands.24

Figure 1 Possible
binding modes of thiol (1), carboxylic acid (2), and phosphonic
acid adsorbates (3: monodentate; 4, 6: bidentate; 5: tridentate) to
surfaces terminated on Ga containing oxides.

With respect to functionalization, recent work has focused
on a
different approach to modify the nanostructured Ga containing oxides.
The so-called in situ procedure modifies the material during the synthesis.
Several advantages are cited including ease of preparation, shorter
time needed to prepare the final product, and the use of water as
a solvent when the Ga salt precursor is mixed with a solution containing
water soluble adsorbates with functional groups that have an affinity
for the oxide. During the in situ protocol, it is important to consider
the Pourbaix diagram for Ga.25 This element
is passivated in small pH windows, and during the in situ procedure
varying pH values can result in leaching of Ga.

During the in
situ procedure, as the Ga2O3 or GaOOH is formed,
the inherent presence of oxides eliminates the
need for an etchant which is required for the in situ modification
of other Ga containing materials, such as GaN.26 This process represents a highly scalable and environmentally
friendly technique for forming organic/inorganic hybrids with long
term interface stability. Representative literature reports have used
cyclodextrin,27 phosphonic acid,22 and carboxylic acid28 derivatives for in situ functionalization of Ga-containing oxides.
In the cases of phosphonic acid derivatives, the passivation achieved
via the in situ procedure resulted in exceptional ligand stability
compared to passivation done ex situ.22 Water soluble dye molecules with carboxylic acid moieties have been
also utilized to modify GaOOH in situ and ex situ. In contrast to
other organic acid derivates the ones containing carboxylic acids
showed excellent stability in water regardless of what method was
used for their preparation.28 These results
support the notion that carboxylic acid derivatives have greater affinity
for Ga containing oxides surfaces compared to other ligands with other
functional groups.

It is important to note in the context of
in situ functionalization
of Ga containing oxides the recent interest in understanding of how
to control the complex oxides that include gallium when nanostructured
materials are formed from liquid metals.29 Representative ligands used to control the synthesis of these materials
and to modify the nanostructured Ga containing oxide shell of these
materials include: thiols, cetrimonium bromide, poly(4-vinyl-1-methyl-pyridinium
bromide), lysozyme, oleic acid, and dodecylamine.30−32 Not all studies
have focused on understanding the nature of the bonding between the
oxide and the chosen ligand, but they have all demonstrated that the
ligands do control the desired shape and size.

IV Applied
Interfaces Based on Ga Containing Oxides
in Aqueous Solutions
We highlight three recent examples published
in the last 20 months
of incorporating Ga containing oxides in interfaces that benefit from
preparation or use in aqueous solutions. The chosen examples are representative
of the unique properties associated with the oxides. We have specifically
chosen examples that derive the materials through methods other than
liquid metal approaches because these have been the subject of other
recent extensive reviews in the literature.

The synthesis of
metal oxides is often motivated by their potential
to perform better in photocatalytic applications. Ismail et al. have
prepared mesoporous Ga2O3–TiO2 nanocomposites and have demonstrated its efficient photodecomposition
of a herbicide.33 The method used to make
the Ga containing oxide is based on the sol–gel in the presence
of copolymer. The amount of Ga2O3 was tuned
during the synthesis by controlling the starting amount of Ga salt
used. The unique structure and composition of the composite contributed
to its mechanism of action, Figure 2A. Specifically, the increased amounts of defects associated
with a large content of Ga2O3 is attributed
to superior ability to trap holes and prevent recombination. The authors
concluded that the improved photocatalytic performance can be traced
to the greater number of acceptor states with respect to Ga2O3 present in the amorphous phase. This conclusion was
supported by luminescence measurements. Additional attributes of the
Ga containing oxide composite are fabrication reproducibility and
stability of the water, as well as the fact that it can be recycled
in multiple cycle while maintaining high efficiency.

Figure 2 Recent applied studies
with Ga containing oxides: (A) mesoporous
Ga2O3–TiO2 nanocomposite for
efficient photodecomposition of herbicide imazapyr (copyright 2018

Society); (C) persistent luminous nanoparticles containing Ga oxides
that can be used in cancer theranostic applications after chemical
functionalization (copyright 2018 American Chemical Society).

Nanostructured Ga containing oxides
have recently shown promise
in lithium-ion batteries. The methodology is depicted in Figure 2B.34 We summarize key features associated with the use of Ga
oxides in this example. The particles are prepared via a hydrothermal
carbonization method that controls their size to 2.6 nm and ensures
the formation of a carbon shell around each particle. The key feature
is that during the lithiation process the carbon shell prevents the
particles from aggregation. Because lithium-ion batteries are intended
to be re-chargeable, stability and lack of aggregates is key during
the cycling evaluation of anode and cathode materials. The reported
Ga2O3 based anode showed superior characteristics
due to its ability to prevent the formation of surface aggregates
while still forming Ga0 during the lithiation process.

In biomedical applications ability to control the optical properties
of nanostructured materials is valuable in designing imaging and targeting
applications. Nanostructured Ga containing oxides show particularly
noteworthy promise for these applications due to their persistent
luminescence properties. A recent advance in particle design showed
that nanostructured particles with hollow cavities that are decorated
with Ga oxides show an afterglow effect due to their persistent photoluminescence, Figure 2C.21 These Ga oxide-containing particles are amenable to other
aqueous solution processing that can enhance their chemo and photodynamic
attributes, in addition to the promise they show in imaging. Most
importantly for these types of applications the particle stability
was verified in vitro and in vivo. This observation along with ability
to accommodate higher drug loading renders the material very promising
for multi-modality biomedical procedures.

V Conclusions
and Outlook
Variety of methods exist to synthesize Ga containing
oxides and
many methods have developed reliable strategies to control the size
and the shape of these materials. Because of their favorable properties
with respect to robustness in different environments, tunability of
excitation and emission properties, and photoconductivity a number
of efforts have demonstrated the promise of the material in applications
that include a wide range spanning the energy and catalysis fields
and extending all the way to pre-clinical biomedical studies. There
are many opportunities that still exist with respect to fundamental
materials chemistry and surface chemistry research on Ga containing
oxides. There is a need to increase the number of variable geometries
associated with these materials as well as compositional mixtures
with other elements. These types of materials have the potential to
exhibit interesting plasmonic properties. Further research is needed
to elucidate the surface bonding modes with different adsorbates and
develop methods to control the adsorption of ligands on Ga containing
oxides. A relatively unexplored surface chemistry on these materials
exists with respect to utilization of ligand exchange reactions as
well as the usage of ligands with variable functional groups. Taken
together current and future advances in the field of Ga containing
oxides are projected to increase their potential for practical applications.
