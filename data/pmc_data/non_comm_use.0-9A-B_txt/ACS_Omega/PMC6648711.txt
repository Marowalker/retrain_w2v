RNA G-quadruplexes are RNA secondary
structures that are implicated
in many cellular processes. Although conventional biophysical techniques
are widely used for their in vitro characterization, more advanced
methods are needed to study complex equilibria and the kinetics of
their folding. We have developed a new Förster resonance energy-transfer-based
method to detect the folding of RNA G-quadruplexes, which is enabled
by labeling the 2′-positions of participating guanosines with
fluorophores. Importantly, this does not interfere with the required anti conformation of the nucleobase in a quadruplex with
parallel topology. Sequential click reactions on the solid phase and
in solution using a stop-and-go strategy circumvented the issue of
unselective cross-labeling. We exemplified the method on a series
of sequences under different assay conditions. In contrast to the
commonly used end-labeling approach, our internal labeling strategy
would also allow the study of G-quadruplex formation in long functional
RNAs.

Introduction
G-quadruplexes are
formed in DNA and RNA sequences bearing repetitive
G-tracts.1,2 The quadruplex core consists of at least
two stacked planar G-quartets which are stabilized by hydrogen bonds
on their Watson–Crick and Hoogsteen faces and π–π
interactions between the planes of the quartets (Figure 1a).3,4 Cations,
particularly potassium, are coordinated by the O6 oxygens
of the guanines and contribute strongly to the overall stability of
the structure.5 G-quadruplexes can adopt
antiparallel or parallel topologies that are determined by the connectivity
of their loops.6 RNA quadruplexes generally
adopt parallel topologies because of the favored anti conformation of the nucleotide.7

RNA G-quadruplexes play roles
in many cellular processes. When
present in mRNA untranslated regions (UTRs), they can alter rates
of translation,8−11 splicing,12,13 polyadenylation,14,15 transcription,16,17 mRNA localization,18 and polyamine homeostasis.19 In specific sequences, G-quadruplexes equilibrate with
stem-loop structures. This can affect, for example, the expression
of disease-related genes19−21 and the processing of precursor
microRNAs (pre-miRNAs).22−24

Conventional biophysical
techniques for the characterization of
G-quadruplexes in vitro are UV melting at 295 nm, circular dichroism
(CD) spectroscopy, and staining with Thioflavin-T after gel electrophoresis.
However, these methods alone are insufficient to prove the existence
of a quadruplex, and new techniques are needed to enable the study
of their sometimes-complex equilibria and the kinetics of their folding.
Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a method to measure
distances between donor and acceptor fluorophores in macromolecules
or macromolecular complexes.25 FRET is
often used to study the dynamics of G-quadruplexes;26−29 typically, donor and acceptor
fluorophores are conjugated to the 5′ and 3′ ends of
an oligoribonucleotide comprising G-tracts of a putative quadruplex.
The fluorophores are most easily introduced in the form of commercially
available phosphoramidites or via coupling of activated esters to
amino linkers after solid-phase synthesis. Folding of the sequence
into a compact quadruplex, mediated by increased concentrations of
cations, brings the acceptor and donor into proximity and allows FRET
between them. Although the terminal labeling of oligoribonucleotides
with fluorophores is relatively straightforward, it offers little
flexibility in structural design and can even confound FRET data as
dyes may stabilize or destabilize the nucleic acid under study.27,30−32 Site-specific (internal) labeling of structured RNAs
is synthetically challenging but has provided important insights on
RNA function.33 Fluorophore labeling at
internal positions of oligoribonucleotides offers much greater flexibility
for an optimal distal positioning of the fluorophores; it allows the
study of quadruplex folding and structural equilibrations in longer
RNAs. An internal labeling of guanosines in G-quartets was described
for DNA quadruplexes where modified nucleobases served as donor and
acceptor groups.34 However, these fluorescent
8-aryl dG probes force a syn conformation of the
guanosines and an antiparallel arrangement that may not represent
the natural structure of RNA quadruplexes.

There are three ways
by which functionalities can be incorporated
site-specifically into oligoribonucleotides, depending on the chemical
stability and reactivity of the conjugate: (i) use of modified phosphoramidites
during solid-phase synthesis, (ii) post-synthetic addition on a solid
support using classical biocompatible reactions, and (iii) solution-phase
conjugations after oligonucleotide synthesis/deprotection and purification.
Where it is required to incorporate two distinct groups (i.e., donor
and acceptor fluorophores) into one sequence without cross-reaction
at reactive sites, a combination of these methods can be employed.35 For instance, to incorporate a psoralen cross-linker
and a biotin handle into pre-miRNAs, we used a combination of (i)
and (ii).36 To label miRNAs with Cy3 and
a black hole quencher, we used a variant of method (ii) with two click
reactions and an interruption of the solid-phase protocol.37 The instability of Cy5 groups to the harsh conditions
of oligonucleotide deprotection means that it is best coupled in solution,
for example, employing a “click-reverse-click” protocol
which we recently developed.38

The
analysis of a crystal structure of a canonical RNA G-quadruplex
indicated that an optimal FRET labeling of guanosines involved in
a quadruplex could be achieved via their 2′-hydroxyl groups
(Figure 1b–d).
Importantly, this labeling strategy does not disturb the anti conformation of the guanosine, thus rendering it compatible with
the formation of a canonical parallel RNA G-quadruplex. Here, we describe
a combination of solid- and solution-phase synthesis to conjugate
site-specifically Cy3 and Cy5 fluorophores to selected guanosines
of proximal G-tracts using copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition
(“click chemistry”). To the best of our knowledge, this
work represents the first internal labeling strategy to study RNA
G-quadruplexes using FRET measurements from participating guanosines.

Results
and Discussion
As RNA G-quadruplexes predominantly form with
parallel topology,
we reasoned that structural insights from the crystal structure of
the human telomeric RNA (TERRA) quadruplex7 might extend to quadruplexes formed from different RNAs. We therefore
analyzed the structure of TERRA for potential sites for fluorophore
labeling, that is, that are outward facing, which are in close proximity
when folded but are separated in differently folded or unfolded structures.
Indeed, the 2′-hydroxyl groups of the guanosines G3 and G12 in proximal G3 tracts at the 3′-terminal
G-quartet of the quadruplex fulfilled these requirements (Figure 1b–d). We chose
a medium linker length (∼12 Å) that is close to the recommended
length (∼14 Å) for cyanine dyes internally attached to
RNA duplexes.39 To reduce possible RNA–fluorophore
interactions, we used sulfonated variants of the cyanine dyes Cy3
and Cy5.40 Using the geometrical search
algorithm FPS,41 we modeled Cy3/Cy5 bis-labeling
at these guanosines in a quadruplex, taking into account the dimensions
of the dyes and the linker (Figures S1 and 1b,d). This gave a calculated distance of 17.4 Å
between the mean fluorophore positions and a calculated FRET efficiency E = 99.9% assuming a Förster radius R0 ≈ 60 Å for the Cy3/Cy5 FRET pair.42 The estimated distance between the mean fluorophore
positions in our internally labeled RNA structures (∼17 Å)
is less than that typically used for single-molecule FRET (R ≈ 0.58 R0) to distinguish
highly polymorphic G-quadruplexes (e.g., telomeric DNA G-quadruplexes).28 We then selected two well-characterized G-quadruplexes
HpG4-243,44 and HpQd45 (hereafter
designated QA and QB, respectively). Both have
been found to equilibrate with alternative hairpin structures.

We expanded the number of sequences in the investigation by exchanging
three nucleotides in QA and QB to give QA1 and QB1, respectively (Figure 2a,b). These exchanges prevented the Watson–Crick
base pairing needed for equilibration to hairpins in QA and QB (Figure S2) and constrained
the conformations of QA1 and QB1 to quadruplexes.

variants. (a) Representation of the G-quadruplex formation

curves at 295 nm in the presence of 1 mM KCl and the calculated Tm’s of QA and QA1. (d) Representative UV-melting curves at 295 nm in 20 mM KCl and
the calculated Tm’s of QB and QB1.

An invariable property of RNA quadruplexes is a hypochromic
shift
at 295 nm upon thermal melting. Indeed, QA1 and QB1 yielded Tm’s of 67 and 78 °C,
respectively, with small increases in Tm compared to those of QA and QB (Figure 2c,d). QA1 and QB1 showed no melting at 260 nm (data not shown). The modeling
studies pointed to the 2′-hydroxyl groups of G3 and
G12 as optimal sites for fluorophore conjugations, respectively.

A synthesis strategy to these target molecules is needed to circumvent
two potential issues: cross-labeling in which incomplete conjugation
reactions lead to inseparable mixtures of fluorophore modifications
and the instability of Cy5 to conditions of oligonucleotide deprotection.
The high G-content of the sequences is added to the challenge of synthesizing
these RNAs. We decided to employ two copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
cycloaddition (“click chemistry”) reactions, the first
with a (“stop-go”) conjugation of Cy3 during interrupted
solid-phase synthesis and the second with a solution-phase addition
of Cy5.35

In the stop-go process,
solid-phase couplings were carried out
with standard phosphoramidites and the first 2′-O-propargyl-bearing guanosine phosphoramidite (1, see
the Supporting Information), until the
penultimate site for the second modification in the sequence was reached
(Figure 3a). The controlled-pore
glass (CPG) support was then removed from the synthesizer and used
for the reaction with Cy3-azide (2).37 After the reaction, CPG was washed liberally with acetonitrile
(ACN) and dried overnight. Automated synthesis was then resumed with
coupling of the second modified guanosine. Upon completion of machine
synthesis, CPG was treated with ammonia/methylamine and fluoride solutions
under standard conditions. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) purification in the DMT-on mode removed truncated sequences
and yielded pure Cy3-modified oligoribonucleotides. After DMT
cleavage, the second click reaction with (3) was performed
as described previously.38 The highly lipophilic
Cy5 group facilitates the second HPLC purification in which mono-labeled
starting material was separated from the desired bis-conjugated products.
The mass and purity of the bis-labeled oligoribonucleotides were verified
by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) (Table 1; Figure 3b). Following this approach,
a small library of Cy3- and/or Cy5-labeled analogues of QA and QB (Table 1) was produced for FRET-based assays. Mono-labeled oligoribonucleotides
Cy3 and Cy5 analogues were prepared as controls using the standard
click reactions on the CPG and in solution, respectively, according
to our published protocols.37,38

CD spectra of QA and QA1 and their bis-labeled
variants QA-c53 and QA1-c53 were recorded to
examine potential effects of the fluorophores on the native fold of
these RNA G-quadruplexes. The CD profiles of all four sequences were
consistent with a parallel G-quadruplex structure characterized by
a peak at ∼264 nm and a trough at ∼240 nm.46 The unfolded negative control QA2, a variant of QA1 where the third G-tract was mutated
to adenosines to prevent any G-quadruplex formation, showed a shift
toward a higher wavelength (∼267 nm) and an additional trough
∼207 nm consistent with the absence of a G-quadruplex structure
(Figure 4a).19,46,47 Canonical RNA G-quadruplexes
show a preference for binding potassium cations.5 Hence, we measured the emission spectra after excitation
(515 nm) of QA-c53 in the presence or absence of 100 mM
KCl (Figure 4b). The
emission spectra are normalized to the maximum of the donor peaks
(∼567 nm), thus the magnitude of the acceptor peak (∼675
nm) reflects a measure of FRET, as reported by Maleki et al.28 We obtained a potassium-dependent increase in
FRET indicated by an increased acceptor peak (∼675 nm) consistent
with the quadruplex-promoting effect of K+.

mM KCl. Emission spectra of the K+-dependent studies (b,e,g,h)
are normalized to the maximum of the donor peaks at 567 nm according
to the FRET representation of Maleki et al.28

To add further support that the
FRET signal of QA-c53
is derived from its quadruplex conformation, we performed two treatments
on QA. Nucleases are expected to disrupt RNA G-quadruplexes1 and are frequently used in RNA footprinting experiments.48 Indeed, addition of RNase T1 to QA-c53 caused an approximate threefold decrease in Erel, displayed by a loss of the acceptor peak (∼675
nm) and an increase of the donor peak (∼567 nm), consistent
with loss of FRET and disruption of the structure (Figure 4c). It was previously reported
that the presence of tRNAs shifted the G-quadruplex-hairpin
equilibrium of QA toward a hairpin conformer.43 The authors postulated that this was due to
a C-tract in the exposed anticodon forming Watson–Crick bonds
to the G-tracts in QA. Therefore, we also performed FRET
measurements on QA-c53 before and after addition of bacterial tRNA (Figure 4d). Indeed, added tRNA caused an approximate 20% decrease
in Erel, indicated by a decrease of the acceptor peak (∼675
nm) and a small increase of the donor peak (∼567 nm), in line
with the earlier published account.43 Additionally,
we tested the quadruplex QA1-c53 for its response to potassium
over a range from 0 to 1000 mM KCl. As expected, quadruplex QA1-c53 showed similar behavior to that of QA-c53
with a quadruplex-promoting effect of K+ (Figure 4b,e,f). During these measurements,
we noted a relatively strong quenching of the donor but a comparatively
low sensitization of the acceptor (Figure S3a). This was attributed to a loss of acceptor efficiency in the G-quadruplex
state (Figure S3b) due possibly to quenching
effects, for example, fluorescence quenching of the G-quartet, dye-dye
contact quenching, or possibly effects from K+.49−51

To demonstrate that this new approach of labeling/detecting
participating
guanosines in RNA G-quadruplexes is applicable to other sequences,
we conducted FRET experiments on the second pair of structures, QB and QB1. This time, we investigated labels introduced
at the guanosines of the 5′-terminal quartet (Figure 2b). To this end, we measured
the emission spectra after excitation (515 nm) of QB-c53
and QB1-c53 in the presence or absence of 100 mM KCl (Figure 4g,h). Both sequences
showed the G-quadruplex-promoting effect of KCl through an increase
of the acceptor peak (∼675 nm). Of note, we observed an increase
in Erel of ∼0.1 for the second
pair of structures QB-c53/QB1-c53 compared to
QA-c53/QA1-c53 in both 0 and 100 mM KCl (Figure 4b,e,g,h). This can
be attributed to sequence-specific structural differences and/or the
different positioning of the fluorophores (Figure 2a,b).

To confirm that the emission
peak at ∼ 675 nm of QA, QB, and their
variants indeed originated from acceptor
(Cy5) emission, we measured the emission spectra after excitation
at 515 nm of the mono-labeled (Cy3) sequences QA-c3, QA1-c3, QB-c3, and QB1-c3 (Figure S4). For all sequences, the peak at ∼675
nm was absent, and the spectral bleed-through of donor emission into
the region of expected Cy5 emission (∼675 nm) was relatively
low.

In summary, we describe here a novel FRET-based strategy
to detect
RNA G-quadruplexes, which differs from current methods26−29 by internal site-specific fluorophore labeling of participating
guanosines. Our synthetic strategy employed two click reactions, with
interruption of the solid-phase synthesis to avoid cross-reactions.
We exemplified our method on a series of sequences under different
assay conditions. We expect this method to find applications in the
rapidly expanding field of RNA G-quadruplexes, for example, in the
study of noncanonical quadruplexes or for structural equilibria involving
quadruplex folding. In contrast to terminal labeling strategies, our
method is not limited to short oligoribonucleotides and would also
allow the study of G-quadruplex formation in long functional RNAs,
possibly in cellular media. The results of these studies will be reported
in due course.

column chromatography was carried out on silica gel, 60 Å (Fluka).
Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (ppm), J values are given in hertz (Hz), and NMR spectra were referenced

2′-O-Propargyl-2-aminoadenosine 5
The synthesis of 5 was performed with
small changes according to the published procedure.53

2-Aminoadenosine 4 (10.0 g, 35.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was dissolved in dimethylformamide
(150 mL) at 100 °C. The mixture was cooled down to 0 °C,
and sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil; 1.4 g, 35.5 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
was added slowly. After 1 h, tetrabutylammonium iodide (2.6 g, 7.1
mmol, 0.2 equiv) and propargyl bromide (80% in toluene; 4.4 mL, 39.1
mmol, 1.1 equiv) were added slowly at room temperature. The reaction
mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. An additional amount
of propargyl bromide (80% in toluene; 2.0 mL, 17.8 mmol, 0.5 equiv)
and sodium hydride (60% in mineral oil; 1.14 g, 28.4 mmol, 0.8 equiv)
was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred for additional 2 h.
Then, the reaction mixture was concentrated. The residue was purified
by flash column chromatography with a gradient 1–8% of MeOH
in CH2Cl2 to give a mixture of 2′-O-propargyl-2-aminoadenosine 5 and 3′-O-propargyl-2-aminoadenosine as a yellow foam.

The
mixture of the two isomers was separated by recrystallization
from EtOH. The 3′-isomer remained in the solution, and the
desired 2′-isomer was precipitated. After filtration, the precipitate
was dried to give 2′-O-propargyl-2-aminoadenosine 5 as a yellow foam (7.0 g, 62%). 1H NMR (400 MHz,

Triethylamine (Et3N) (1.1 mL, 8.1 mmol, 5.0 equiv) and
2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite
(0.54 mL, 2.4 mmol, 1.5 equiv) were then added. The reaction mixture
was stirred at room temperature. After 1.5 h, another 1.5 equiv of
2-cyanoethyl-N,N-diisopropylchlorophosphoramidite
was added. After 2 h, the reaction was complete. THF was evaporated,
and the residue was dissolved in EtOAc. The organic layer was washed
with 5% NaHCO3, brine, dried over the sodium sulfate, and
evaporated. The crude was purified by flash column chromatography
with a gradient 0–1% of MeOH in CH2Cl2 with 2% of Et3N to give compound 1 as a

Oligonucleotide Synthesis,
Deprotection, and Purification
Chemicals were purchased from
Biosolve and Aldrich. Phosphoramidites
were purchased from Thermo Fisher. The activator 5-benzylthio-1H-tetrazole was purchased from Carbosynth. All oligonucleotides
used in this work were synthesized on a 50 nmol scale with the MM12
synthesizer (Bio Automation Inc.) using 500 Å UnyLinker CPG (ChemGenes).

The coupling time for 2′-O-TBDMS phosphoramidites
was 2 × 150 s and that for the 2′-O-propargyl
guanosine phosphoramidite was 2 × 240 s.

For deprotection,
CPG was treated with gaseous methylamine for
1.5 h at 70 °C (unmodified oligoribonucleotides) or with a mixture
of 200 μL of ammonia (25% in H2O) and 200 μL
of methylamine (40% in H2O) for 6 h at 35 °C (modified
oligoribonucleotides). After basic deprotection and cleavage from
the solid support, CPG was washed with 3 × 200 μL of H2O/EtOH (1:1) mixture. To the solution, 20 μL of 1 N
Tris-base was added, and it was evaporated to dryness in a SpeedVac.
Desilylation was carried out by treatment with 130 μL of a mixture
of N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (60 μL), triethylamine
(30 μL), and triethylamine trihydrofluoride (40 μL) at
70 °C for 2 h. The reaction was quenched by adding trimethylethoxysilane
(200 μL, 3 min, room temperature). Diethyl ether was added (200
μL, 5 min, room temperature), and the mixture was vortexed and
centrifuged.

The precipitate was dissolved in 200 μL of
H2O
and purified on an Agilent 1200 series preparative RP-HPLC on an XBridge
OST C-18 column (10 × 50 mm, 2.5 μm; Waters) at 65 °C
with a flow rate 5 mL/min. Buffer A: 0.1 M aqueous triethylamine/acetic
acid, pH 8.0; buffer B: 100% MeOH; gradient 20–60% B in 5 min.

Fractions containing the DMT-on product were collected, dried in
a SpeedVac, and treated with 40% aqueous acetic acid for 15 min at
room temperature. Samples were concentrated in a SpeedVac, dissolved
in 200 μL of H2O, and purified in the DMT-off mode
by RP-HPLC on an XBridge OST C-18 column (10 × 50 mm, 2.5 μm;
Waters) at 65 °C with a flow rate 5 mL/min. Buffer A: 0.1 M aqueous
triethylamine/acetic acid, pH 8.0; buffer B1: 100% MeOH;
buffer B2: 100% ACN; gradient 5–30% B1 in 5 min (QA, QA-c3, QA1, QA1-c3, QB, QB1), 5–40% B1 in 5 min (QB-c5, QB-c3, QB1-c3),
5–50% B1 in 7 min (QA-c5, QA-c53, QA1-c53, QB-c53, QB1-c53),
or 2–20% B2 in 3 min (QA2).

Fractions
containing the desired product were collected and dried
in a SpeedVac, and oligonucleotides were analyzed by the LC–MS
(Agilent 1200/6130 system) on an Acquity OST C-18 column (2.1 ×
50 mm; Waters). The column oven was set to 65 °C, flow-rate:
0.3 mL/min. Solvent C: H2O containing 0.4 M hexafluoroisopropanol,
15 mM triethylamine; solvent B: MeOH; gradient 5–35% B in 14
min (QB, QB1, QB-c3), 5–40%
B in 14 min (QB-c5, QA, QA1), 5–45%
B in 14 min (QA-c5, QA-c3, QB1-c3,
QA1-c3), 5–30% B in 11 min (QA2) or 5–50%
B in 14 min (QA-c53, QA1-c53, QB-c53,
QB1-c53).

UV absorption of the final products was
measured in duplicate or
triplicate on a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer (Fisher Scientific).
Concentrations were calculated based on the nearest-neighbor model
with in-house programmed software.

Synthesis of Cy3- and/or
Cy5-Labeled Oligoribonucleotides
The Cy3 and Cy5 mono-labeled
oligoribonucleotides were prepared
by the post-synthetic copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition
reaction between alkyne-bearing oligoribonucleotide and Cy3-azide 2 or Cy5-azide 3 performed on the solid support
(before the first deprotection step) or in solution (on fully deprotected
oligoribonucleotides), respectively, following the published protocols.37,38

Synthesis of Bis-Labeled Oligoribonucleotides
After
the incorporation of the first propargyl-bearing guanosine (Y; Figure 3a, Table 1), the synthesis was continued
until the penultimate site for the second modification was reached.
Subsequently, the first click reaction between the alkyne-modified
oligoribonucleotide and Cy3 azide 2 was performed, as
described before.37,38 After the post-click washing,
CPG was washed additionally with 5 mL of dry ACN, transferred back
to the column, and dried overnight. Then, the synthesis was resumed
starting from the coupling of the second 2′-O-propargyl-modified guanosine (position X in the sequences; Figure 3a, Table 1). Upon completion of the automated
solid-phase synthesis, oligoribonucleotides were cleaved from the
solid support and deprotected with aqueous ammonia/methylamine solution,
followed by standard desilylation protocol. After HPLC purification
in the DMT-on mode and removal of the DMT group, the click reaction
in solution with Cy5 azide 3 was performed as described,52 followed by the HPLC purification in the DMT-off
mode.

Fluorescence Spectroscopy
Oligoribonucleotides were
prepared at a concentration of 0.5 μM in a buffer containing
50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid–LiOH,
2 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween-20 adjusted to pH 7.0. KCl was
added at the indicated final concentration. After incubation for 5
min at 95 °C, samples were progressively cooled down to 4 °C
for 90 min and measured at room temperature in 384-well microplates
(Corning; low volume, flat bottom, black polystyrene). Emission spectra
were recorded from 530 to 775 nm (increments: 1 nm) with excitation
at 515 nm in a microplate reader (Tecan Spark 20M). The relative FRET
efficiency (Erel) was calculated after
buffer subtraction and smoothing (Savitzky–Golay, convolution
width 25) according to eq 1. For the representation of FRET, the emission spectra at different
concentrations of KCl were normalized to the maximum of the donor
peaks (∼567 nm), as reported by Maleki et al.28 To determine the relative acceptor efficiency (rel. AE),
fluorescence emission at 675 nm was collected with excitation at 640
nm and normalized to a comparative sample (0 mM KCl; Figure S3b). The emission/excitation bandwidth was set to
5 nm.

tRNA from Escherichia coli MRE 600 (Merck, TRNAMRE-RO) was added to a final concentration of
20 μM, and the emission spectra were recorded after 1 h of incubation
at room temperature.

For the enzymatic digestion, the sample
was incubated for 1 h at
37 °C with 20 U/μL RNase T1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
EN0541). 1  

UV Melting
Thermal melting was performed
using a Varian
Cary 300 spectrophotometer. Oligoribonucleotides at a concentration
of 4 μM were prepared in 10 mM lithium cacodylate, pH 7.2 at
the indicated concentration of KCl. The samples were heated for 5
min at 90 °C, then cooled down to 20 °C, and heated again
to 90 °C (0.2 °C min–1). The absorbance
at a wavelength of 295 nm was recorded every 0.2 °C, and the
melting temperature (Tm) was calculated
as described previously.19 Representative
melting curves are shown in Figure 2c,d. The mean Tm of ≥2
scans is given.

CD Spectroscopy
CD spectra were
recorded between 200
and 320 nm at 20 °C on a Jasco J-10 spectropolarimeter. The buffer
subtracted average of more than three consecutive CD scans (20 nm
min–1, 4 s response time, 0.5 nm data pitch, 2 nm
bandwidth, light path 1 mm) is given. The RNAs were prepared at a
concentration between 0.5 and 4.0 μM in 10 mM lithium cacodylate,
10 mM KCl, pH 7.2, heated for 5 min at 95 °C, and then progressively
cooled down to room temperature for 60 min before to be equilibrated
at 4 °C for >1 h. The data were smoothed using a Savitzky–Golay
filter (convolution width 25).
