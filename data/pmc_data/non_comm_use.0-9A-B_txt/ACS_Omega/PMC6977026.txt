Previous studies
have demonstrated that allergenic feed proteins
from peanuts in the diets of layer hens are not detected in the eggs
produced. Hence, in this study, we aimed to determine if soy and/or
peanut proteins in poultry feed rations of broiler chickens or layer
hens would be transferred or detectable in the meat or eggs produced.
To meet this objective, 99 layer hens and 300 broiler chickens were
equally divided into treatment groups and fed one of three experimental
diets: control soybean meal and corn diet, whole unblanched high-oleic
peanut and corn diet (HO PN), or a control diet spiked supplemented
with oleic acid (OA) oil. At termination, broiler chickens were processed,
and chicken breast samples of the left pectoralis muscle were collected,
and eggs were collected from layers. Total protein extracts from pooled
egg samples and chicken breast samples were subjected to enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods and immunoblotting analysis with
rabbit antipeanut agglutinin antibodies and rabbit antisoy antibodies
for the detection of peanut and soy proteins. Peanut and soy proteins
were undetected in all pooled egg samples and individual chicken breast
meat samples using immunoblotting techniques with rabbit antipeanut
agglutinin and rabbit antisoy antibodies. Moreover, quantitative ELISA
allergen detection methods determined all pooled egg samples and individual
meat samples as “not containing” peanut or soy allergens.
Therefore, this study helps to evaluate the risk associated with the
potential transfer of allergenic proteins from animal feed to the
products produced for human consumption.

Introduction
Studies have estimated that more than
26 million American adults1 and approximately
8% of children2,3 within the United States suffer
from food allergies.4 In the United States,
approximately 200 000 Americans
annually require urgent medical care due to food allergies, correlating
to emergency medical care every 3 min due to food hypersensitivity
responses.5 Without proven treatment and/or
prevention strategies, consumers with hypersensitivity responses to
foods must refrain from all potentially offending foods to minimize
the risk of systemic anaphylaxis. Therefore, consumers must rely upon
the accuracy of food ingredient labeling and the avoidance of hidden
ingredients that appear in packaged food, due to cross-contact with
food allergens during the manufacturing process. Thus, strict adherence
within food manufacturing facilities to food allergen sanitation methods
defined in an effective Allergen Control program6−8 is an extremely
important public health concern to the food-allergic consumer.

However, studies conducted by Fæste et al. (2014)9 suggested that dietary avoidance of food allergens
with stringent food labeling might not be adequate to identify all
potential allergenic proteins in foods. This study suggests that allergic
responses to food may be possible when consuming meat products produced
from animals fed diets containing allergens.9 In this study, zebrafish were fed a parasitic nematode found within
fish and marine animals, Anisakis simplex, which cause food-allergic symptoms in humans when consumed.10,11 Fæste et al. (2014) demonstrated that the flesh of the zebrafish
contained A. simplex nematode proteins
after 14 days of feeding fishmeal spiked with A. simplex, and upon consumption, it elicited an allergenic response in a sensitized
consumer.9 Moreover, Armentia et al. (2006)
reported the detection of A. simplex
allergenic peptides in chicken meat produced from poultry fed fishmeal
containing A. simplex and A. simplex Ig-E responses in sensitized consumers
of these chicken meat products.12

Fishmeal is normally prepared using processed and cooked fish remnants
directly on factory
ships.13,14 However, studies have shown allergenic peptides
isolated from A. simplex to be highly
protease and thermally stable.15 Consequently,
we aimed to detect peanut and/or soy peptides in the meat or eggs
produced from broiler chickens or layer hens fed diets containing
soy (soybean meal) or high-oleic peanuts. Soybean meal, which contains
soy allergens, is commonly used as a conventional poultry ration in
poultry meat and egg production and therefore might transfer to the
meat and/or eggs produced. Previous studies within our lab have demonstrated
the effective use of high-oleic peanuts as an alternative poultry
feed ingredient to effectively enrich the meat or eggs produced.16 Subsequently, in this study, we aimed to determine
if allergenic peptides found in poultry feed are detectable in the
eggs or meat produced from broiler chickens and laying hens fed diets
containing high-oleic peanuts.

Results and Discussion
For the detection
of peanut or soy peptides in the eggs or meat
produced from poultry fed diets containing soybean meal or high-oleic
peanuts, total protein extracts from pooled egg and individual chicken
breast samples were analyzed by immunoblotting methods. Total protein
extracts from pooled egg samples were not detected using rabbit antipeanut
agglutinin antibodies, while reactive with total proteins extracted
from peanut flour (Figure 1), thus implying that peanut proteins cannot be detected in
the eggs produced from egg-producing hens fed a high-oleic peanut-containing
diet for 8 weeks. Moreover, total protein extracts from breast samples
from broilers fed a high-oleic peanut diet for 6 weeks were also nonreactive
with rabbit antipeanut agglutinin antibodies, while total proteins
extracted from the positive control, peanut flour were detected (Figure 2). Hence, allergenic
peanut proteins from the broiler diet were not detected in the meat
produced.

Figure 1 Immunoreactivity of protein extracts from eggs produced from layer
hens fed a high-oleic peanut diet. Total proteins were extracted from
pooled egg samples (three replicates per treatment, with 10 eggs pooled
per replicate) and electrophoretically ran on a 10% polyacrylamide
gel with 75 μg of total protein per lane. Resolved proteins
were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with
rabbit IgG antipeanut agglutinin antibodies (1:1000), and detection
was determined with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) activity. Positive
control = peanut flour extracted proteins (75 μg). Negative
control = soybean flour extracted proteins (75 μg).

Figure 2 Immunoreactivity of protein extracts from chicken breast samples
collected from broiler chickens fed a high-oleic peanut diet. Total
protein extracts from chicken breast samples (eight samples per treatment)
were ran using 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) with 75 μg of total protein per lane. Resolved proteins
were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane and immunoblotted with
rabbit IgG antipeanut agglutinin antibodies (1:1000); detection was
determined using chromogenic peroxidase substrate with HRP. Positive
control = peanut flour extracted proteins (75 μg).

Subsequently, total protein extracts were immunoblotted with
rabbit
antisoy primary antibodies to determine the presence of soy peptides
in the eggs or meat produced from layer hens and broilers, respectively,
fed diets containing soybean meal. All egg (Figure 3) and chicken breast total protein samples
(Figure 4) were nonreactive
with rabbit antisoy primary antibodies, while reactive with soybean
flour total protein extracts, thus suggesting that soy proteins cannot
be detected in the eggs and/or meat produced by egg-producing layers
or broiler chickens fed soy diets. In parallel, other studies have
also demonstrated that peptide allergens such as peanuts are not detected
in the eggs produced from layer hens fed experimental peanut diets
for 10 weeks.16

Figure 3 Immunoreactivity of protein
extracts from pooled egg samples produced
from layer hens fed a high-oleic peanut-containing diet for 8 weeks.
Protein extracts from pooled egg samples (three replicates per treatment,
with 10 eggs pooled per replicate) were run by SDS-PAGE on a 10% polyacrylamide
gel with 75 μg of total protein per lane. Immunoreactivity of
resolved proteins was determined by immunoblotting with nitrocellulose
membrane and rabbit IgG antisoy antibodies (1:1000) and detection
using chromogenic peroxidase substrate with HRP activity. Soybean
flour extracted proteins (75 μg) = positive control.

Figure 4 Immunoreactivity of protein extracts from chicken breast samples
produced from broilers fed a high-oleic peanut-containing diet for
6 weeks. Protein extracts from chicken breast samples (eight samples
per treatment) were run on a 10% SDS-PAGE l with 75 μg of total
protein per lane. Resolved proteins were immunoblotted using nitrocellulose
membrane and rabbit IgG antisoy antibodies (1:1000) and detection
with chromogenic peroxidase substrate and HRP activity. Soybean flour
extracts (75 μg) = positive control.

Notwithstanding, previous studies (Armentia et al., 2006) reported
hypersensitivity responses in A. simplex-sensitized patients by allergens found in meat consumed from chickens
fed fishmeal diets containing A. simplex allergenic peptides.12 While Armentia
et al. (2006) focused on the transfer of A. simplex larval peptides from poultry diets to the meat produced, we aimed
to investigate the transfer of immunoreactive proteins found in feedstock
rations of poultry to the meat or eggs produced. Moreover, we aimed
to address the safety concerns of food-allergic consumers regarding
the potential transfer of allergenic peptides from animal feed to
the food produced for human consumption using immunoblotting techniques
with antigen-specific antibodies for detection.

While the United
States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA)
has not established allergen reference doses for precautionary food
labeling within manufacturing facilities, the Allergen Bureau, a nonprofit
international industry-based organization, started by food industry
within Australia and New Zealand issued the voluntary incidental trace
allergen labeling (VITAL) initiative.17 The VITAL initiative provided food manufacturers’ with (1)
defined allergen reference doses, (2) manufacturing allergen sanitation
methods and risk management strategies, and (3) consistent precautionary
labeling of food allergens of packaged food products.18,19 In March 2006 (U.S. FDA, 2006), The Allergen Threshold Working Group
at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition posted a report
regarding food allergen thresholds and that “The Food Allergen
Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004 (FALCPA), requiring the
label of a food product that “is” or “contains”
an ingredient of the eight major known food allergens, declare the
presence of that allergen within the product labeling”.20 The report posted summarized the scientific
knowledge of food allergen research in a dose–response relationship
and highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of each study. However,
no conclusive allergen reference doses were identified in this summary
report, and any decisions for establishing thresholds for food allergens
would require additional factors not covered to date (July 16, 2018),
and therefore The Allergen Threshold Working Group has yet to make
a decision on the establishment of food allergen thresholds until
present.20

In the VITAL initiative,
food products containing less than 2 ppm
of peanut proteins or less than 10 ppm of soy proteins do not require
declaration of allergens in food labeling; however, food products
containing 2–20 ppm of peanut proteins or 10–100 ppm
of soy proteins must be labeled declaring “trace” amounts
or “may be present” of these allergens within the food
labeling.17 Therefore, in this study, we
aimed to define the number of allergens detected in pooled egg samples
and individual meat samples based upon the VITAL reference doses,17 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
methods and to also validate the immunoblotting results of this study.

This study determined that pooled egg and individual meat samples
had less than an average of 2 ppm (mg/kg) of peanut proteins and per
the VITAL reference doses defined as not containing peanut allergens,
which validates the immunoblotting results of this study (Table 4). Interestingly,
pooled egg samples from layers fed the control diet contained an average
of 0.1 ppm of peanut proteins, in contrast to 0 ppm of peanut protein
in eggs produced from layer hens fed the high-oleic peanut and oleic
acid (OA) diet, suggesting that pooled egg samples from hens fed the
control diet may have contained minute amounts of peanut proteins
due to laboratory cross-contamination during assay methods or handling
(Table 4). Pooled egg
and individual meat samples were determined by ELISA to have less
than an average of 4 ppm of soy proteins and per the VITAL reference
doses defined as not containing soy allergens, which also validate
the immunoblotting results of this study (Table 4). In summary, this study demonstrates that
allergenic proteins in the feed of broiler chickens and layer hens
are not detected in the meat and/or eggs produced, which parallels
previous high-oleic peanut-feeding studies with egg-producing layer
hens.16 Therefore, this study helps to
evaluate the associated health risk to the food-allergic consumer
of meat or eggs produced from poultry fed diets containing allergenic
food proteins.

Conclusions
In summary, these results
imply that peanut proteins found in peanut
poultry diets were not detected in the eggs or meat produced from
layers or broilers and therefore would not be expected to elicit an
allergic response in peanut-sensitized individuals. Other work has
revealed that a substantial portion of incoming dietary proteins in
the diets of monogastric animals (piglets and humans) are digested
during metabolism within the gut mucosa, with the aid of digestive
enzymes secreted from chief cells, pancreas, and intestinal cells,21,22 and thus do not remain intact as polypeptide chains upon transport
from the intestine to the use within the tissues for reproduction,
growth, development, repair, or maintenance.22 Regardless, it is common knowledge that many allergenic food proteins
are stable to digestive proteases and acid denaturation and have an
increased likelihood of reaching the intestinal mucosa unchanged where
absorption might occur, and these allergenic proteins could potentially
be incorporated intact within the tissues or found within the products
of production animals fed diets with allergenic proteins. Nonetheless,
this study indicates that allergenic proteins found in the diets of
production animals were not detected in the products produced using
immunoblotting or ELISA detection methods. As a consequence, feeding high-oleic
peanuts as a poultry feed ingredient to egg-producing hens and meat-type
chickens does not appear to pose a public health issue for the peanut-sensitized
consumer (Table 1).

Materials and Methods
Layer
Hen-Experimental Design, Animal Husbandry, and Dietary
Treatments
With 57 week-old Leghorn hens, we compared three
isonitrogenous (18% protein), isocaloric (3080 kcal/kg metabolizable
energy) dietary treatments (Table 2) prepared 2 weeks prior to the onset of the study
and maintained in feed storage bins in NCSU Feed Mill in a cool dry
location. The control diet layer diet was a conventional mash soybean
meal + corn diet (control) composed predominately of yellow corn,
corn gluten, soybean meal, wheat bran, and vegetable oil, with NCSU
vitamin, mineral, and selenium premix (Table 2). Treatment 2 was a high-oleic peanut +
corn diet prepared using aflatoxin-free whole nonroasted unblanched
shelled high-oleic peanuts. Prior to inclusion within the diet, whole
raw high-oleic peanuts were crushed using a Roller Mill. The high-oleic
peanut + corn diet (HO PN) was composed predominately of yellow corn,
corn gluten, raw whole high-oleic peanuts, and wheat bran, supplemented
with amino acids l-lysine, dl-methionine, l-tryptophan, and l-threonine along with NCSU vitamin, mineral,
and selenium premix. The oleic fatty oil diet (OA) was prepared using
the control diet supplemented with 2.64% (% by weight) food-grade
oleic fatty acid oil (Millipore Sigma, Burlington, MA). Experimental
diets were analyzed and determined to be free of aflatoxin and microbiological
contaminants by the North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services, Food and Drug Protection Division Laboratory (Raleigh, NC).

Ninety-nine 57 week-old Brown Leghorn
layer hens (NCSU-University-maintained
poultry flock) were randomly assigned to 33 animals per treatment
group with three replicates/treatment of 11 animals per replicate.
Animals were housed individually in conventional layer batter cages
in one room. Animals were provided experimental feed and water ad
libitum and provided with 14 h of light daily for 8 weeks. The Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee at North Carolina State University (Raleigh,
NC) approved all experimental animal protocols (approved protocol
17-001-A) prior to the onset of this study. Egg samples were collected
and pooled per replicate at termination (week 8) of the study and
subsequently used for protein extraction. Egg samples were pooled
in a sterile Whirl-pak bag (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL)
and homogeneously mixed using a Stomacher Lab Blender.

Broiler Meat-Type
Chicken-Experimental Design, Animal Husbandry,
and Dietary Treatments
On the day of hatch, male broiler
chicks (Ross 708) were randomly placed into 30 wire battery cages
with 10 birds per cage (N = 100). Broiler chicks
were randomly assigned and fed ad libitum one of three isocaloric,
isonitrogenous dietary treatments with a starter diet (3120 kcal/kg,
23% protein) from days 0 to 14 and a grower diet (3190 kcal/kg, 21%
protein) from days 15 to 42 (Table 3, starter diet; Table 4, grower diet). Antioxidant,
santoquin (Novus International, Saint Charles, MO), was added (1%)
to the diets to prevent rancidity. Broilers were fed a conventional
soybean meal and corn control diet, or a high-oleic peanut and corn
diet (HO PN) or a control diet spiked with oleic fatty acid oil (OA)
for 6 weeks.

The HO PN diet was prepared using
peanut crumbles prepared from
aflatoxin-free whole nonroasted unblanched high-oleic peanuts. The
oleic-fatty-acid-oil-supplemented (6%) diet (OA) was prepared by supplementing
the control diet with 6% food-grade oleic fatty acid oil (Millipore
Sigma, Burlington, MA). Experimental diets were analyzed and determined
to be free of aflatoxin and microbiological contaminants by the North
Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, Food and
Drug Protection Division Laboratory (Raleigh, NC).

At termination,
one bird from each of 10 pens for each treatment
group was selected for processing (N = 30). Broilers
with an individual body weight within one-half standard deviation
from the experimental mean body weight were selected for processing.
Birds were removed from feed only 10 h prior to termination and processing.
The left pectoralis major sections were removed from each bird and
chilled in an ice bath for 4 h and subsequently sealed and stored
at −80 °C until protein extraction.

Protein Extraction,
SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting Analysis
A 1 mg section of the
left pectoralis major breast muscle from
eight broiler chickens and a 1 mL sample of pooled shell egg samples
were utilized for protein extraction. Total protein extraction, SDS-PAGE
analysis, immunoblotting, and detection techniques were followed using
methods described by Toomer et al. (2019) with a rabbit IgG antipeanut
agglutinin primary antibody 1:1000 dilution (Lifespan Biosciences,
Seattle, WA) or rabbit antisoy primary antibody 1:1000 dilution (Sigma-Aldrich,
St. Louis, MO) and donkey antirabbit IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
Dallas, TX).16

Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent
Assay (ELISA) Food Allergen Detection
ELISA assays were performed
for the detection of peanut and soy
allergens using total protein extracts from chicken breast and pooled
egg samples in triplicate with the RIDASCREEN FAST Peanut and RIDASCREEN
FAST Soya allergen detection kits per the manufacturer’s instructions
(R-Biopharm, Darmstadt, Germany).
