Bismuth
metallic nanoparticles have evoked considerable interest
in catalysis owing to their small size, high surface area-to-volume
ratio, and low toxicity. However, the need for toxic reductants and
organic solvents in their synthesis often limits their desirability
for application development. Here, we describe a green strategy to
synthesize bismuth nanodots via the redox reactions between bismuth
nitrate and d-glucose, in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
in the basic aqueous phase. Both reagents play a crucial role in the
formation of monodisperse bismuth nanodots acting as mild reducing
and capping agents, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
catalytic activity of these dots via the successful reduction of the
environmental contaminant 4-nitrophenol to its useful 4-aminophenol
analogue requiring only 36 μg/mL nanocatalyst for 20 mM of the
substrate. Moreover, they can be recovered and recycled in multiple
reactions before the onset of an appreciable loss of catalytic activity.
The proposed facile synthetic route and inexpensive matrix materials
lead the way to access bismuth nanodots for both the fundamental study
of reactions and their industrial catalysis applications.

Introduction
Nanosized metallic
materials have been the subject of intense research
during the past decades due to their remarkable properties including
tunable size and shape, large surface area-to-volume ratios, and highly
active surfaces with potential applications in catalysis, optics,
sensing, detection, and biotechnology.1 Among these metallic nanostructures, bismuth has recently attracted
particular interest because its transition from a semi-metal to a
semiconductor could occur when the crystalline size of bismuth is
small enough according to the quantum confinement effect.2 More importantly, based on its low toxicity profile,3 bismuth nanomaterials have recently been investigated
for applications such as multifunctional theranostic agents and in
X-ray computed tomography/photoacoustic imaging-guided photothermal
therapy.4 This stems from the ability to
strongly attenuate X-rays, and their strong near-infrared absorbance
and high photothermal conversion efficiency.4,5 Additionally,
bismuth-containing materials also have promising implications in many
advanced applications ranging from photodetectors to thermoelectricity
and photocatalysis.6 For example, in the
last few years, bismuth nanomaterials have been integrated with typical
photocatalysts (e.g., TiO2,7 g-C3N4,8 Bi2WO69), as plasmonic
metal nanostructures, to effectively improve the photocatalytic performance
for the degradation of environmental pollutants in water.

To
date, several strategies have been developed for the synthesis
of pure bismuth nanomaterials since it is a well-known “green
element” that is inexpensive and relatively nontoxic among
the heavy metals.10 These commonly employed
methods are mainly divided into the following four categories: (i)
thermal decomposition,11 (ii) mechanochemical
processing,6a,12 (iii) photochemical,13 and (iv) solution-phase chemical reduction methods.2,4,6c,14 Generally, the thermal decomposition method could be used to obtain
high-quality monodisperse elemental bismuth nanoparticles. Buhro and
co-workers made significant contributions to the synthesis of near
monodisperse, size- and shape-controlled Bi nanoparticles using thermal
decomposition of organometallic precursors.11b,11c However, this method requires harsh preparation conditions, expensive
organometallic precursors, high temperatures, and long reaction times,
which limit its broad application. The mechanochemical processing
technique, including laser ablation and sonication exfoliation methods,
usually employs inexpensive and nontoxic bulk bismuth pellets as precursors;
however, the synthesis process is demanding with respect to energy-consumption
along with the need for costly instrumentation (e.g., high-powered
lasers). The photochemical reaction was used for the synthesis of
bismuth nanoparticles by Wiesner and co-workers who reported the preparation
of nanoparticles via a photochemical polythiol process under ambient
light,13a requiring 24 h or even longer
reaction times. Feldmann and co-workers reported the synthesis of
bismuth particles via photochemical synthesis but did not achieve
high product yield.13b In recent years,
the simple solution-phase chemical reduction method (e.g., solvothermal
and microwave methods) has garnered significant attention as an alternative.
This approach often involves the reduction of bismuth metal salts
in the presence of a surfactant that acts as a stabilizer.15 However, the experimental process is not easy
to control, and organic solvents are typically required, resulting
in bismuth nanomaterials with poor morphological purity. Another attractive
approach in developing nanocatalysts is through the fabrication of
nanohybrids that aim to achieve high catalytic activity as shown by
Li et al., who designed Bi nanoparticles supported by N-doped graphene.16 Although some of the current research studies
have investigated the fabrication of nanoscale bismuth through simpler
approaches,5b,14g,17 the use of toxic reductants and/or organic solvent are still inevitable
during synthesis. Therefore, it remains desirable to develop a facile
and green method for the synthesis of high-quality bismuth nanoparticles
in aqueous solution. To the best of our knowledge, there are few reports
concerned with the direct aqueous-phase synthesis of high-quality
pure bismuth nanoparticles with dimensions on the order of and less
than 5 nm.

In this work, we develop a direct aqueous-phase synthesis
strategy
to fabricate ultrasmall bismuth-containing nanodots in water by reducing
Bi3+ ions with d-glucose in the presence of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
(PVP). The entire experimental process follows the concept of green
chemistry using inexpensive raw materials, water as the solvent, and
mild reaction conditions. The nanodots are extensively characterized
using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to confirm the size, phase,
and chemical states. In a proof concept, we evaluate the catalytic
activity and stability of the obtained bismuth nanodots in the reduction
of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP), which is usually catalyzed by noble metal
nanoparticles such as gold, silver, and platinum. The recovery and
reusability of the bismuth nanodot catalyst are also investigated
in multiple reaction cycles.

Results and Discussion
Following
the synthesis and purification, powder XRD was used to
characterize the crystal phase of the bismuth nanodots. Figure 1a depicts the XRD pattern of
the bismuth nanodots prepared by direct aqueous-phase chemical synthesis.
All of the diffraction peaks can be well indexed to the pure rhombohedral
phase of Bi (JCPDS no. 44-1246), revealing that the obtained product,
under the current synthetic conditions, is elemental bismuth. The
reflections at 27.2, 37.9, 39.6, 48.7, and 64.5° 2θ can
be indexed to the (012), (104), (110), (202), and (122) planes of
rhombohedral bismuth, respectively. No trace of the Bi2O3 phase was detected in the bismuth nanodot sample evidenced
by the absence of prominent Bi2O3 reflections
(JCPDS no. 65-2366) typically noted at 27.4, 33.1, and 33.3°
2θ. It should be noted that d-glucose and PVP molecules
play a crucial role in the formation of Bi nanodots in this aqueous-phase
synthesis with d-glucose acting as a mild reducing agent
for the reduction of metal salts, and PVP as a stabilizer to protect
the nanoparticles from aggregation. In the absence of d-glucose,
Bi3+ ions could not be reduced to elemental Bi and instead,
a pure α-Bi2O3 sample was obtained (Supporting
Information (SI), Figure S1). Additionally,
when PVP was excluded from the reaction, bulk bismuth pellets formed
(SI, Figure S2).

(d) particle size distribution analysis of the Bi nanodots showing
an average of 3.7 ± 0.6 nm; (e) EDS analysis of the Bi nanodots
revealing the presence of Bi as the dominant element.

The isolated bismuth nanodots can be easily dispersed in
water
forming a black colloidal dispersion (Figure 1b inset), which was analyzed using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) as shown in Figure 1b,c. The nanodots show a quasi-spherical
morphology with a Gaussian size distribution ranging from 2 to 5.5
nm and a mean particle size of 3.7 ± 0.6 nm (Figure 1d). It is interesting to note
that when ammonium bismuth citrate was used as the bismuth source,
ultrasmall bismuth nanoparticles can also be successfully prepared
but the particle size distribution is polydisperse (SI, Figure S3).

The high-resolution TEM image
(Figure 1c inset) reveals
the crystalline nature of
the obtained nanodots and lattice fringes with a measured interplanar d spacing of 0.33 nm, which is in good agreement with the
(012) plane of rhombohedral Bi.4 Energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis shown in Figure 1e demonstrates that the bismuth nanodots contain bismuth (Bi),
carbon (C), and oxygen (O) elements. The strong bismuth peaks indicate
the successful synthesis of bismuth nanodots, while the weak O peak
may arise from PVP molecules on the surface of particles and surface
oxidation of bismuth nanodots (vide infra), which is responsible for
its overall catalytic activity. We also investigated the hydrodynamic
diameter for a freshly prepared colloidal dispersion of bismuth nanodots
using dynamic light scattering (DLS) (SI, Figure S4). A significant difference between the crystallite size
observed by TEM (3.7 nm) and the hydrodynamic size (68.8 nm) as measured
by DLS may be attributed to the surrounding hydration layer and the
PVP molecules attached to the surface of nanodots, which confer good
colloidal stability to the dots and minimize instances of aggregation.
The colloidal dispersion of the dots shows a broad absorbance profile
ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared spectral regions.
The absorbance features located around 400 and 550 nm (Figure 5S) may arise from surface plasmon resonance
and light scattering phenomena, which are also observed in bismuth
nanospheres prepared by high-temperature thermolysis of bismuth acetate
in oleylamine.11e

To further confirm
the nature of the chemical states at the surface
of the nanodots, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was performed. Figure 2a presents the XPS
survey spectrum of the Bi nanodot powder, and we note the binding
energy positions (along with their respective % composition) assigned
to Bi (18.25%), O (35.22%), and C (46.53%), confirming the chemical
composition of the obtained bismuth nanodots. The binding energies
for the spin–orbit splitting of the two characteristic Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 peaks are observed at 164 and 159
eV, respectively. The binding energy corresponding to the characteristic
Bi 5d peak of metallic bismuth is also observed at 26 eV, which coincides
with the reported literature value.18 The
binding energy recorded at 531 eV corresponds to the characteristic
peak of O 1s, evidence of the existence of oxide species on the surface
of Bi nanodots. The high-resolution XPS spectrum of the Bi 4f level
is presented in Figure 2b. The binding energy values obtained at 159.1 and 164.5 eV are assigned
to the core levels of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2,
respectively, which can be ascribed to Bi–O in Bi2O3,19 indicating the formation
of amorphous oxide species on the surface of bismuth nanodots. Two
weak peaks of metallic bismuth appear at binding energies of 157.6
and 162.2 eV. As shown in Figure 2c, the O 1s peaks can be deconvoluted into three peaks
at 532.7, 530.9, and 529.7 eV, which can be assigned to O–H,
O–C, and O–Bi, respectively. The XPS results here reveal
that the Bi nanodots are indeed surface oxidized, which could not
be verified by powder X-ray analysis as this technique is not sufficiently
sensitive to provide such information.

spectrum of Bi 4f7/2 and Bi 4f5/2 states. (c)

(FTIR) spectra of Bi nanodots and PVP molecules.

Additional characterization was carried out using FTIR spectra
to further study the chemical composition of the bismuth nanodot surface.
The spectrum in Figure 2d depicts the FTIR spectrum of the Bi nanodots, which show a vibration
at 3220 cm–1 ascribed to O–H asymmetric stretching
noting that this would be observed for pure PVP molecules at 3440
cm–1. This shift is attributed to the interaction
of PVP with the nanodot surface, which has also been observed in other
PVP-decorated nanoparticles.4 Moreover,
the absorption bands assigned to the C–H asymmetric stretching
at 2850 cm–1, C=O stretching at 1650 cm–1, and C–N vibrations at 1285 and 1035 cm–1 are identified and found to be consistent with the
characteristic peaks of PVP molecules.20 These observations confirm that PVP molecules are indeed decorating
the surface of the bismuth nanodots adsorbed on the nanodot surface
conferring colloidal stability and dispersibility.

Having demonstrated
the successful formation of the Bi nanodots
provided the impetus to investigate their catalytic performance in
the reduction of nitroaromatic compounds. The reduction of nitroaromatic
compounds to amines is an important reduction reaction in synthetic
organic chemistry and the production of industrially relevant chemicals.
The reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) over metal nanoparticles, especially
noble metal nanoparticles in the presence of NaBH4, is
an efficient strategy to produce 4-aminophenol (4-AP).21 Metal nanoparticles enable the catalytic reduction
of 4-NP by relaying the electrons from BH4– to 4-NP when both reactants are adsorbed on the surface of the nanocatalyst.22 In contrast to noble metal nanoparticles, there
are few reports on the catalytic reduction of 4-NP by inexpensive
bismuth nanoparticles, especially ultrasmall bismuth nanodots. Herein,
to investigate the catalytic performance of our non-noble Bi nanodots,
the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by NaBH4 at room temperature
was used as a model reaction, and the reduction progress was monitored
by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy on the reaction mixture following
the addition of bismuth nanodots. It should be noted that the color
of the 4-NP aqueous solution changed from light to bright yellow immediately
upon mixing with NaBH4 and an intense UV–vis absorption
peak appeared at 400 nm rather than the original absorption peak at
317 nm (SI, Figure S6). This is ascribed
to the formation of the 4-nitrophenolate compound under basic conditions
following the addition of NaBH4. In the absence of the
nanocatalyst, the solution color remains bright yellow and the absorption
spectra shape and peak intensity remain essentially unchanged even
after 12 h, indicating that the reduction of 4-NP is kinetically restricted
(SI, Figure S7). On the other hand, with
the addition of Bi nanodots, the catalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP
is greatly accelerated. Figure 3a shows the time-resolved UV–vis absorption spectra
of 4-NP by NaBH4 in the presence of Bi nanodots. The characteristic
absorption peak at 400 nm of 4-NP gradually decreases after the introduction
of Bi nanocatalyst and is accompanied by the increase of new bands
at ∼230 and 300 nm ascribed to 4-AP. The presence of an isosbestic
point at ∼275 and 314 nm confirms that only 4-AP is obtained
from catalytic reduction without the occurrence of any side reactions.
In a control experiment, we also investigated bulk bismuth pellets
obtained through nanodot synthesis, in the absence of PVP, and we
noted that they do not show any catalytic activity for the reduction
of 4-NP to 4-AP (SI, Figure S8). This can
be attributed to the smaller percentage of the available Bi atom sites
at the surface. This renders the bulk form less reactive than its
nanoscale counterpart.

Figure 3 (a) Time-dependent UV–vis absorption spectra during
the
reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) by NaBH4 in the presence
of Bi nanodots at room temperature over 150 min. The top inset shows
a digital photograph of 4-NP before and after the reduction reaction
catalyzed by Bi nanodots; (b) relationship between ln(C/C0) and the reaction time during the
course of catalytic reduction of 4-NP over bismuth nanodots in the
presence of NaBH4; (c) reusability of bismuth nanodots
as nanocatalysts for the reduction of 4-NP during the three cycles
of use. The nanodots were isolated and reused in 3 separate reactions
over a 30 min time frame.

The time evolution of the reduction process can be conveniently
assessed using time-resolved UV–vis spectroscopy of the reaction
mixture. Under pseudo-first-order conditions ([4-NP] = 0.22 mM, [NaBH4] = 22 mM, [Bi nanodots] = 36 μg/mL) a plot of ln(A/A0) vs time displays an initial
nonlinear behavior followed by a linear decay of absorbance band at
400 nm (Figure 3b).
This behavior is in agreement with the previously proposed mechanism,
where at the initial stages of the reaction, the nanoparticle undergoes
surface modifications thereby activating the surface for catalytic
reduction.23 This initial slow induction
period is followed by linear decay as is expected from the pseudo-first-order
reaction. The rate constant was determined to be 6.033 s–1 g–1, which is comparable—if more efficient—to
other reported metallic-based catalyst.24 It is also noted that some reported hybrid or noble metal-based
systems are more efficient, but are not as cost-effective as our system.16,25 The reusability of the Bi nanocatalyst for the reduction of 4-NP
by NaBH4 was investigated. The Bi nanodots were recycled
and used repeatedly up to three cycles, showing its practicality for
4-NP reduction. The catalytic performance decreases in part with the
increase of cycles, but still exhibits good catalytic performance
(Figure 3). TEM images
of the nanodots show aggregation after cycling uses (SI, Figure S9a), and EDS analysis reveals a similar
elemental composition profile to that prior to the reduction reactions
(SI, Figure S9b). In addition, it is noted
that the recycled nanodots possess a similar diffraction pattern when
compared to the pattern prior to the cycling experiments suggesting
that they are still primarily composed of Bi (SI, Figure S10). The decrease in the catalytic activity is ascribed
to the loss of Bi nanocatalysts during centrifugation and recovery,
as well as aggregation and the adsorption of the reaction product
on the nanodot surface that reduces the number of catalytically active
sites for the reaction.

In conclusion, we have synthesized ultrasmall
and size uniform
bismuth nanodots through a direct aqueous-phase synthesis for the
first time. The synthetic route here follows the concept of green
chemistry, involving the reduction of a bismuth nitrate precursor
by an aqueous d-glucose solution in the presence of PVP as
a stabilizer. The reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP by NaBH4 as
a model reaction shows that the bismuth nanodots can effectively promote
catalytic reduction reactions while retaining their stability. The
high catalytic activity, simple synthetic process, and low production
cost render these inexpensive and nontoxic bismuth nanodots ideal
candidates for use in the degradation of organic pollutants. Further
investigations for incorporating the nanodots in porous inorganic
materials such as mesoporous SiO2 and TiO2 for
facile recovery and recycling are currently underway. It is expected
that the immobilization of the catalyst will optimize the recovery
process and avoid aggregation of nanodots during catalytic reduction.

Materials
and Methods
Materials
Bismuth nitrate pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O) and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Mw = 40 000) were purchased from Alfa
Aesar. d-Glucose and 4-nitrophenol were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
Sodium borohydride (NaBH4) was purchased from Fluka. All
of the reagents were of analytical grade and were used directly without
further purification.

Synthesis of Bismuth Nanodots
In
a typical procedure,
1 mmol of Bi(NO3)3 was added to a solution of d-glucose and PVP in 50 mL Millipore water. The mixture was
stirred in a water bath at 70 °C, and 10 mM of 5 M aqueous NaOH,
preheated to 70 °C, was added dropwise, upon which black bismuth
particles began to form. The mixture was kept stirring at 70 °C
for 2.5 h and then left standing at 25 °C for 10 h. The resulting
product, a black powder, was collected from the supernatant via centrifugation.
Purification was achieved by washing with ethanol and water three
times. The product was freeze-dried for 24 h and stored at 25 °C
thereafter.

Powder X-ray Diffraction Analysis
X-ray diffraction
patterns were measured on a Bruker D2 Phaser diffractometer using
Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15405 nm). Analysis of the powder
was carried out over the range of 2θ = 10–80° with
a step size of 0.02° and a 0.5 s count time. Analysis was carried
out using MDI Jade software.

Transmission Electron Microscopy Analysis
The size
and morphology of the bismuth nanodots were obtained using a Philips
Tecnai G2 F20 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with a field
emission gun operating at 200 kV. The TEM samples were prepared by
depositing 20 μL droplets of nanodots in ethanol on 300 mesh
Carbon Type-B Formvar film-coated Cu grids (Ted Pella) and drying
for several hours. Nanoparticle size distribution was determined by
manual measurement using ImageJ software. A minimum of 100 individual
nanoparticles were used to calculate the mean and standard deviation.

X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Analysis
X-ray photoelectron
spectra (XPS) were measured on a Thermo Scientific K-Alpha spectrometer.
The obtained binding energies were calibrated with that of the adventitious
carbon (C 1s) core level peak at 284.8 eV. Each analysis was performed
in triplicate with 10 runs for each scan. The average of the triplicates
was plotted for both the survey and the high-resolution scans.

UV–Vis–NIR
Absorbance Analysis
The UV–vis–NIR
absorption spectra were performed on a Cary 5000 UV–vis–NIR
spectrophotometer from 300 to 1200 nm. A 1 cm quartz cuvette was used
for analysis. The instrument was set to a 2 nm bandwidth for analysis
coupled with a wavelength changeover at 800 nm. The data was processed
using Cary Eclipse software.

Hydrodynamic Diameter Measurements
The hydrodynamic
diameters were measured using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano-S. All experiments
were carried out using a disposable folded capillary cell (Malvern).
For each experiment, 10 measurements comprising 20 runs were recorded.
For each sample, experiments were repeated three times. The concentration
of the samples was ∼0.5 mg/mL in Millipore water. Measurements
were carried out using 0.7 mL of the solution.

Fourier-Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FTIR)
FTIR
spectra were collected using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS5 equipped
with an iD5 ATR accessory. Spectra were collected over the range of
525–4000 cm–1 using 64 scans, with a resolution
of 0.4 cm–1, a gain of 1, an optical velocity of
0.4747, and an aperture setting of 100. The data were processed using
the Omnic 9 software package.

Catalytic Reduction of
4-Nitophenol
A freshly prepared
aqueous solution of NaBH4 (30 mM, 1 mL) was added to 0.3
mL 4-NP aqueous solution (2 mM) and 1.4 mL of water. The color of
the solution quickly changed from light to deep yellow following the
addition of NaBH4. The bismuth nanodot suspension in water
(0.75 mg/mL) was then added to the mixture until the deep yellow solution
gradually became colorless. During the course of the catalytic reduction
reaction, UV–vis absorption spectra were recorded to monitor
reaction progress over time, from 250 to 550 nm, at 25 °C. The
bismuth nanodots were separated, freeze-dried, and reused for 3 successive
repeated cycles to investigate the reusability of bismuth nanodot
catalysts for the same reaction procedure.
