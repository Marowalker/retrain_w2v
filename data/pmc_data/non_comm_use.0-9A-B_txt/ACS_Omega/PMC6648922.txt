FexOyHz nanostructures
were incorporated into commercially
available and highly porous alumina using the temperature-regulated
chemical vapor deposition method with ferrocene as an Fe precursor
and subsequent annealing. All processes were conducted under ambient
pressure conditions without using any high-vacuum equipment. The entire
internal micro- and mesopores of the Al2O3 substrate
with a bead diameter of ∼2 mm were evenly decorated with FexOyHz nanoparticles. The FexOyHz/Al2O3 structures showed substantially high activity
for acetaldehyde oxidation. Most importantly, FexOyHz/Al2O3 with a high surface area (∼200
m2/g) and abundant mesopores was found to uptake a large
amount of acetaldehyde at room temperature, and subsequent thermal
regeneration of FexOyHz/Al2O3 in air resulted in the emission of CO2 with only a negligibly
small amount of acetaldehyde because FexOyHz nanoparticles
can catalyze total oxidation of adsorbed acetaldehyde during the thermal
treatment. Increase in the humidity of the atmosphere decreased the
amount of acetaldehyde adsorbed on the surface due to the competitive
adsorption of acetaldehyde and water molecules, although the adsorptive
removal of acetaldehyde and total oxidative regeneration were verified
under a broad range of humidity conditions (0–70%). Combinatory
use of room-temperature adsorption and catalytic oxidation of adsorbed
volatile organic compounds using FexOyHz/Al2O3 can be of potential application in indoor and outdoor
pollution treatments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Volatile
organic compounds exist in indoor and outdoor environments.
Indoor atmospheres contain materials used for interior construction
such as paints and adhesives that consist of organic solvents, which
are volatile and known to cause “sick-building syndrome”.1−5 In the outdoor atmosphere, volatile organic compounds are emitted
from vehicles, power plants, and anything using fossil fuels. In these
cases, incomplete combustion of fuel and subsequent emission of volatile
organic compounds are unavoidable.1,2,6−9 Volatile organic compounds in outdoor environments
are recently of more concern because these molecules act as seeds
for secondary organic aerogels under atmospheric conditions by interacting
with light and nitrogen-containing compounds.10,11 Toxicity of the volatile organic compounds themselves and that of
the secondary organic aerogels induced by volatile organic compounds
have been widely reported in the literature.1−5,10,11 Therefore, removal of volatile organic compounds has become more
and more important in environmental science and engineering.

Adsorbents with very high surface area materials are one of the
most widely used methods for removing volatile organic compounds.
Activated carbon is the most widely used adsorbent for pollutants
in air, and more recently, novel materials with high surface areas
and porosities such as metal–organic frameworks have shown
potential for applications as adsorbents.12−16 Adsorbents are one of the most efficient ways for
removing volatile organic compounds, and they also have the advantage
that the energy consumption for operation of an adsorbent-based filtering
system seems to be quite low. However, once all the surface adsorption
sites are occupied by molecules, the adsorbent should be replaced
by a new one, and the used adsorbents should be regenerated (e.g.,
by thermal treatment). During the thermal regeneration process, adsorbed
species can be re-emitted into the air, causing a secondary pollution
problem.12,17

An alternative way of removing volatile
organic compounds is heterogeneous
catalysis. Here, volatile organic compounds consisting of C, H, and
O and oxygen gas (or water vapor) can adsorb on the surface of catalysts
and react to form CO2 and H2O. Ideally, heterogeneous
catalysts can be permanently used because the reaction products (CO2 and H2O) desorb from the surface of the catalyst,
thus always providing free adsorption sites to the next volatile organic
compound.17 Generally, nanoparticles of
Pt-group metals supported by mesoporous alumina or silica are widely
used for the catalytic oxidation of volatile organic compounds.2,18,19 Catalytic converters are widely
used for exhaust gas treatments in vehicles. In this case, emitted
gas is at a relatively high temperature (<150 °C) at which
Pt-group catalysts can work properly. However, the use of such catalysts
for indoor pollution treatment is limited due to the energy cost needed
for heating the catalysts to their operating temperatures. Another
hurdle for the use of Pt-group catalysts is the high prices of these
materials and their low natural abundance.

Alternative materials
to Pt-group metals such as Ni, Co, Cu, and
Au have been widely considered as candidates of the key components
of catalytic converters for polluted atmospheres.20−28 Some of these cost-effective materials (in the form of nanoparticles
less than ∼5 nm in diameter) can be as efficient as Pt group-based
catalysts for the total oxidation of volatile organic compounds.20,21,29−33 However, these catalytically active nanoparticles
exhibit lower thermal stability and therefore easily agglomerate into
larger particles, losing the effective surface area and catalytic
activity within a short time.

One of the promising methods for
increasing the thermal stability
and catalytic activity of nanoparticles is incorporating them into
mesoporous media. There have been many works devoted to fabricating
mesoporous substrates in which catalyst nanoparticles are highly dispersed.
Many works related to this issue are based on the synthesis of mesoporous
materials and incorporation of catalytically active species during
the synthesis process of the mesoporous structures.24,26,28,34 Alternatively,
one can consider the use of already commercially available and cost-effective
mesoporous alumina or silica as substrates and post-incorporation
of catalytically active nanoparticles into the mesoporous templates.20,21,35−42 However, wet-chemical processes based on the capillary force of
the solvent often hinder diffusion of metal salt ions or metal nanoparticles
into the deeper part of mesoporous templates. Vapor deposition methods
such as atomic layer deposition (ALD) can effectively incorporate
catalytically active nanoparticles into mesoporous media.20,35−42 We have recently reported that temperature-regulated chemical vapor
deposition (TR-CVD), which does not require complex equipment like
ALD, can efficiently incorporate NiO and FexOyHz nanoparticles
at the internal structure of bead-type substrate of mesoporous alumina
and silica substrates.21,43

In this work, FexOyHz was incorporated into a very
cost-effective commercially available alumina bead with not only mesopores
but also micropores using TR-CVD. The resulting structures were used
as catalysts for acetaldehyde oxidation. Our results suggest the possibility
of fabricating more cost-effective FexOyHz/Al2O3 catalysts, which are efficient for total oxidation
of volatile organic compounds. It is worth mentioning that the Al2O3 sample we used is currently as cost-effective
as activated carbon, which is a widely used adsorbent for air purification.
The most crucial result of this work is that our FexOyHz/Al2O3 can operate as an effective adsorbent
of volatile organic compounds at room temperature, and thermal regeneration
of the used adsorbent results in dominant emission of CO2 with only negligibly small amounts of volatile organic compounds
due to the total catalytic oxidation of adsorbed volatile organic
compounds molecules into CO2 by FexOyHz nanoparticles
evenly dispersed within the mesoporous Al2O3 beads. The cycle of adsorption of volatile organic compounds on
FexOyHz/Al2O3 and its regeneration
without pollutant emission can work under a broad range of humidity
and be repeated many times.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Bulk and FexOyHz-Decorated
Al2O3 Beads
Table 1 summarizes the specific
surface areas and mean pore sizes of alumina substrates before and
after FexOyHz deposition and subsequent postannealing.
Before FexOyHz deposition, Al2O3 shows a relatively high surface area (305.1 m2/g) and
a small mean pore size (5.5 nm). For all characterizations of FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3, the sample
with Fe loading of 10 wt % was used. After FexOyHz deposition
using TR-CVD and subsequent postannealing at 450 °C under ambient
conditions, the surface area of the sample significantly decreased
(from 305.1 to 204.3 m2/g), and the mean pore size slightly
increased (from 5.5 to 5.8 nm). This result can be interpreted in
two ways: the pores smaller than ∼3–4 nm existing in
Al2O3 ruptured during the TR-CVD and postannealing
process, or those pores were blocked by FexOyHz nanoparticles.
In fact, the pore size distribution of these samples displayed in Figure 1 clearly shows that
the number of pores smaller than ∼3–4 nm existing in
fresh Al2O3 disappeared upon FexOyHz deposition and postannealing. For further shedding light
on the structure of FexOyHz overlayer deposited in Al2O3, TEM was used. Even though the use of high-resolution
TEM and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging was not successful
in obtaining information about the structure of FexOyHz, Fe elemental mapping image clearly showed that nanoparticles smaller
than 3–4 nm in lateral size of the Fe-containing structure
were finely distributed on the surface of Al2O3 (Figure 2). One can
therefore suggest that FexOyHz nanoparticles with
a mean size of ∼3–4 nm could fill the pores of Al2O3, reducing the specific surface area and increasing
the mean pore size of the substrate. However, the possibility that
the pores ruptured during TR-CVD and postannealing cannot be ruled
out.

To shed
light on the distribution of FexOyHz within
the porous Al2O3 bead after deposition of Fe
using TR-CVD, cross sections of FexOyHz/Al2O3 were monitored using EDS elemental mapping of the sides
of the mechanically fractured samples (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3a,b, both Al and Fe were evenly distributed
over the entire plane of the side of the mechanically fractured FexOyHz/Al2O3, indicating that FexOyHz was deposited on the surface of the alumina bead
and evenly distributed in the entire internal structure of the alumina
bead. We have previously shown that such even decoration of the internal
structure of γ-Al2O3 with larger pores
with Fe could be realized using the TR-CVD method.21 Note that the Al2O3 substrate used
in the present work consists of a higher portion of micropores, and
therefore, diffusion of the Fe precursor into deeper layers of the
Al2O3 bead during the TR-CVD process could be
much more kinetically hindered. As shown in Figure 3a,b, however, an even distribution of Al
and Fe was observed in the entire internal structure of FexOyHz/Al2O3 in the present work.
Thus, our TR-CVD technique allows efficient incorporation of FexOyHz nanoparticles in the core part of the alumina beads,
consisting of both meso- and micropores in size.

and the cross-sectional plane of each sample was analyzed.

Figure 4 shows XRD
patterns of bulk and FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3. For the bulk Al2O3, the appearance
of a pronounced peak at 67° was accompanied by multiple broad
peaks in the 2θ range from 20° to 50°. This pattern
can be attributed to the χ-phase of Al2O3, even though we cannot exclude the existence of other phases of
Al2O3 such as γ-Al2O3.45 After deposition of FexOyHz, no additional feature could be clearly seen, most likely
due to the small particle size of FexOyHz and its poor
crystallinity.

Figure 5 shows
XPS
Fe 2p3/2 spectra of FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3. Fe 2p3/2 spectra of Fe2O3 show multiple features, which can be attributed to
surface and bulk components of Fe2O3 and many
other states related to final state relaxation effects.46,47 In the literature, different phases of Fe oxide such as α-Fe2O3, γ-Fe2O3, and Fe3O4 exhibited different shapes of Fe 2p spectra.
The Fe 2p3/2 spectrum in Figure 5 was deconvoluted into five different components
based on the information from the literature; however, considering
the ratio between areas of five different components used for fitting
the Fe 2p3/2 spectrum in Figure 5, one cannot attribute our Fe 2p3/2 spectra to a specific phase of Fe oxide, even though the binding
energy of the peaks can be mostly attributed to Fe(III) (∼709–712
eV) with some minor contribution of Fe(II) (∼706–709
eV). UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy also does not
provide a clear clue to the crystalline structure of the FexOyHz (Figure S1).

XRD, XPS, and UV–Vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
failed
to provide a deep insight into the structure of FexOyHz. To shed light on the detailed structure of FexOyHz nanoparticles on Al2O3, we employed Mössbauer
spectroscopy. The spectrum obtained at −268.95 °C together
with the results of fitting of the spectrum is shown in Figure 6. It is notable that there
is a strong doublet structure centered at ∼0 mm/s of the velocity,
and this feature can be attributed to the ferrihydrite structure (Fe5O7(OH)·4H2O).48 The ferrihydrite structure is known to be very defective
and exists only in the form of nanostructures.49 For completely fitting the experimentally obtained Mössbauer
spectra, A and B sites of Fe3O4 as well as α-Fe2O3 should be included, each of which can be represented
by a sextet feature with different shifts and splittings (Figure S2). It is worth noting that Fe3O4 consists of a mixture of Fe(II) and Fe(III), and therefore,
two different sites for Fe3O4 should be included
in the fitting process. As summarized in Figure 6, our FexOyHz structure can
be attributed to a complex mixture of ferrihydrite, Fe3O4, and α-Fe2O3.

spectrum of FexOyHz/Al2O3 taken
at −268.95 °C together with the fitting
results. The parameters used for fitting the spectrum are summarized
in the table below the spectrum.

2.2 Catalytic Oxidation of Acetaldehyde
Figure 7 shows the
results of the light-off experiments using FexOyHz/Al2O3 samples with three different Fe loadings (3,
6, and 10 wt %). Starting from 450 °C, the reactor temperature
was decreased with a constant cooling rate under a constant feed of
acetaldehyde vapor with dry air, and at the same time, the gases in
the outlet of the reactor were analyzed using GC. For the sample with
10 wt % Fe, the CO2 evolution rate is close to the corresponding
value of the total oxidation of the acetaldehyde fed into the reactor
at above 300 °C (Figure 6). When the reactor temperature became lower than 300 °C,
the CO2 evolution rate drastically decreased with decreasing
temperature; however, the acetaldehyde consumption rate shown in Figure 7b remained nearly
constant within the temperature range of 50–450 °C, and
most of the acetaldehyde molecules introduced into the reactor were
consumed inside the reactor. Acetaldehyde is removed mostly by total
oxidation to CO2 and H2O above 300 °C.
Below this temperature, partial oxidation of acetaldehyde and adsorption
of the partially oxidized species take place on the surface of FexOyHz/Al2O3. Molecular chemisorption
of acetaldehyde is most likely the removal path of acetaldehyde in
the lower temperature range, where the acetaldehyde consumption rate
is close to 100%, yet almost no CO2 was observed. With
deceasing Fe loading from 10 wt % to 6 and 3 wt %, the CO2 evolution rate slightly decreased; decrease in the CO2 evolution rate with decreasing Fe loading was pronounced in the
temperature range above 300 °C. On the other hand, the sample
with 6 wt % Fe loading showed nearly complete consumption of acetaldehyde
from 450 to 50 °C, whereas 3 and 10 wt % samples showed very
slight decrease in the acetaldehyde consumption below 300 °C.
The total oxidation rate of acetaldehyde correlates with the amount
of Fe, implying that FexOyHz should be an active
species for acetaldehyde total oxidation. Regarding acetaldehyde adsorption
and partial oxidation activity, which do not correlate with the amount
of Fe, not only FexOyHz but also FexOyHz/Al2O3 interface sites and Al2O3 can come into play.

°C. (e) TPD results after the acetaldehyde oxidation for 24 h
at 250 °C using FexOyHz/Al2O3 (10 wt% Fe).

To shed light on the stability of the catalytic activity
of FexOyHz/Al2O3 with 10 wt % Fe
loading,
acetaldehyde was fed into the reactor with the catalyst at a temperature
of 250 °C, and the reaction products were measured using a GC
connected to the outlet of the reactor. As shown in Figure 7c, a nearly constant acetaldehyde
consumption rate was shown for 1440 min, indicating high stability
of the catalyst structures. The CO2 evolution was not observed
at the initial stage of each experiment (Figure 7d) because acetaldehyde is most likely consumed
by partial oxidation and molecular chemisorption on the Al2O3 surface. This chemisorption was a different case from
the physisorption mentioned in Figure 9c. As the Al2O3 surface is saturated
by acetaldehyde and its partial oxidation products, further incoming
acetaldehyde can diffuse more efficiently to FexOyHz/Al2O3 catalysts in the form of an extrinsic
precursor, and CO2 evolution was then observed.43 After the catalytic activity experiment, a temperature
programmed desorption (TPD) experiment was subsequently performed,
and the only desorption species detected by GC was CO2 (Figure 7e). Residual carbon
from chemisorbed acetaldehyde or partially oxidized species of acetaldehyde,
which was not totally oxidized at the initial stage of the long-term
catalytic activity experiment, remained on the catalyst surface, resulting
in a large amount of CO2 desorption in the subsequently
performed TPD experiment. Most of CO2 in the TPD experiment
was desorbed below 400 °C.

The greatest advantage of using
FexOyHz/Al2O3 could be addressed
via TPD experiments, which
shows how the adsorbed acetaldehyde molecules are desorbed from the
surface (Figure 8).
The TPD experiment was subsequently performed after the adsorption
of acetaldehyde for 60 h, and the results are shown in Figure 8. It is worth noting that the
TPD experiments can imitate the oxygen-limited situations when instant
and intensive heat is treated as in the practical regeneration process
of catalysts. One can see that a much larger amount of CO2 was generated when FexOyHz was deposited on the
Al2O3 structure, which implies higher incomplete
oxidation of acetaldehyde in the case of bulk Al2O3. Moreover, in the chromatogram of the gases passed through
the reactor at 350 °C (Figure S3),
various toxic organic molecules (e.g., CO, CH4, Cx) were additionally produced in the case of
bulk Al2O3, while only CO2 was generated
in FexOyHz/Al2O3. Unlike bulk Al2O3, FexOyHz/Al2O3 did not emit any secondary pollutants during the regeneration
process.

acetaldehyde adsorption was carried out for 60 h under dry condition.

2.3 Adsorption
of Acetaldehyde on FexOyHz/Al2O3 at Room-Temperature and Thermal
Oxidative Regeneration of Adsorbents
The porous Al2O3 substrate used in the present work is well known for
its cost effectiveness, and the TR-CVD process for FexOyHz deposition based on thermal evaporation with ferrocene
as an Fe precursor under ambient conditions also shows the potential
for cost-effective fabrication of catalysts in a larger scale. Our
FexOyHz/Al2O3 samples should
be potential candidates of adsorbents of various volatile organic
compounds. FexOyHz nanoparticles incorporated within
porous alumina substrate can also efficiently catalyze total oxidation
of volatile organic compounds, yielding CO2 and H2O. FexOyHz/Al2O3 can capture volatile
organic compounds at lower temperatures, and along with thermal regeneration
of the saturated adsorbents, FexOyHz can catalyze
the conversion of volatile organic compounds to CO2. Assuming
that this scenario can be realized, it can overcome problems of conventional
adsorbents and catalysts. For example, widely used adsorbents such
as activated carbon emit volatile organic compounds upon thermal regeneration
of the saturated adsorbents. In addition, thermal catalysts require
high temperature, and therefore, energy cost for constantly operating
thermal catalysts is of concern.

Our attempt reveals that FexOyHz/Al2O3 shows the high adsorption
capacity of acetaldehyde near room temperature. On the other hand,
most of the adsorbed acetaldehyde is converted into CO2 upon thermal regeneration of the adsorbents under atmospheric conditions.
As shown in Figure 9a, the acetaldehyde molecules fed into the
reactor (concentration of acetaldehyde at the inlet of the reactor
was 160 mol ppm) with 1 g of FexOyHz/Al2O3 were almost completely removed by FexOyHz/Al2O3 under dry air conditions for 12 h. When
FexOyHz/Al2O3 exposed to acetaldehyde-containing
dry air for 12 h was subsequently heated with a constant heating rate
under dry air flow, a large amount of CO2 was desorbed
from FexOyHz/Al2O3 in the
reactor temperature range of 100–450 °C with a pronounced
desorption peak at 270 °C (Figure 9b). The amount of acetaldehyde desorbed during this
thermal treatment of FexOyHz/Al2O3 exposed to acetaldehyde-containing dry air is negligibly
small with respect to the CO2 desorption (Figure 9c) This acetaldehyde adsorption/oxidative
regeneration of FexOyHz/Al2O3 can be repeated many times (Figure S4).

Figure 9 (a) Acetaldehyde flow rates at the outlet of the reactor with FexOyHz/Al2O3 during acetaldehyde
adsorption experiment as a function of time with four different humidity
levels (0, 30, 50, and 70% RH). (b) CO2 evolution rates
and (c) acetaldehyde desorption rates during TPO of FexOyHz/Al2O3 after acetaldehyde adsorption
for 12 h under various humidity level conditions. (d) Percentages
of the amount of molecularly desorbed acetaldehyde and emitted CO2 during TPO from FexOyHz/Al2O3 acetaldehyde adsorption for 12 h under various humidity level
conditions.

We also studied the influence
of the humidity of the atmosphere
to the adsorption capacity of FexOyHz/Al2O3 toward acetaldehyde as well as thermal oxidative regeneration
of acetaldehyde-saturated surfaces. With increasing humidity of the
air with acetaldehyde, acetaldehyde adsorption capacity of the surface
decreased; for dry conditions, no acetaldehyde could be seen in the
outlet of the reactor during 12 h by complete adsorption of all incoming
acetaldehyde molecules into the reactor at FexOyHz/Al2O3; however, with increasing humidity of the atmosphere
from 0 to 30%, increase in the acetaldehyde concentration at the outlet
of the reactor could be found. With further increase in the humidity
level, increase in the acetaldehyde concentration at the outlet of
the reactor with time became more pronounced, indicating that humidity
decreases the adsorption capacity of acetaldehyde due to the competitive
adsorption. This result can suggest that the surface of our FexOyHz catalyst is quite hydrophilic, probably due to the
existence of hydroxyl groups from the ferrihydrite phase on the surface
of FexOyHz particles. As an attempt to increase resistance
against humidity, one can possibly consider coating a hydrophobic
silicon-based polymer layer on the surface of porous materials. However,
this hydrophobic silicon layer lacks thermal stability; this hydrophobic
layer starts to decompose at 250 °C.50 Formation of thermally stable and humidity-resistant surface warrants
further studies, yet the highlight of the present work is the complete
oxidation of acetaldehyde of FexOyHz/Al2O3.

In the subsequently performed thermal regeneration
experiment using
air flow with the humidity used for the respective adsorption experiments
near the room temperature, CO2 desorption could be found
at 300–450 °C with the maximum desorption rate at ∼400
°C, which is much higher that the CO2 maximum desorption
temperature of dry condition experiments. Water vapor shows a blocking
effect not only for the adsorption of acetaldehyde near the room temperature
but also for total oxidation of acetaldehyde to CO2 at
∼300 °C.

We have calculated the amount of acetaldehyde
taken from the FexOyHz/Al2O3 surface under conditions
of various humidity levels and how much adsorbed acetaldehyde was
either desorbed as an acetaldehyde molecule or converted into CO2 in each experiment (Figure 9d), and the details of the calculations are given in Figure S5. Even though increase in the humidity
in this experiment decreased acetaldehyde uptake, nearly all adsorbed
acetaldehyde near room temperature was converted into CO2 in the subsequently performed TPO experiments. Therefore, we can
conclude that our FexOyHz/Al2O3 can be used as adsorbents of acetaldehyde, which can be regularly
thermally regenerated, thereby emitting almost no acetaldehyde but
only CO2 under a wide range of humidity levels of atmosphere.

3 Conclusions
FexOyHz nanoparticles
smaller than ∼3–4
nm were incorporated into commercially available and highly porous
alumina using TR-CVD and subsequent annealing. We showed that FexOyHz nanoparticles were evenly spread throughout the
substrates, even for Al2O3 beads with a diameter
exceeding 1–2 mm consisting of micro- and mesopores. This indicates
that that the whole structure of mesoporous bead-type substrates can
serve as supports for FexOyHz catalysts. FexOyHz-decorated Al2O3 shows high
catalytic activity for acetaldehyde total oxidation at ∼250
°C or above. It is worth noting that the porous alumina used
in the present work is nearly as economical as activated carbon, which
is a widely used adsorbent in commercial air-purifying systems. Most
importantly, we found that FexOyHz-decorated Al2O3 can adsorb a large amount of acetaldehyde at
room temperature, and subsequent thermal regeneration of the FexOyHz/Al2O3 adsorbent resulted in
emission of CO2 with only a negligible amount of acetaldehyde
because Fe2O3 nanoparticles can catalyze the
total oxidation of acetaldehyde adsorbed on the surface during the
thermal treatment of FexOyHz/Al2O3. The adsorption of acetaldehyde and oxidative regeneration
of the FexOyHz/Al2O3 adsorbents
can be repeated several times. The room-temperature adsorption of
acetaldehyde and subsequent thermal oxidative regeneration for FexOyHz/Al2O3 were verified under
a wide range of humidity levels of the atmosphere. Conventional adsorbents
such as activated carbon generally emit volatile organic compounds
adsorbed on the surface into the air during regeneration, causing
a secondary pollution problem. On the other hand, current thermal
catalysts for oxidation of volatile organic compounds should constantly
operate at high temperature, requiring high energy cost for operation.
Room-temperature adsorption and catalytic oxidation of adsorbed volatile
organic compounds with the FexOyHz/Al2O3 can be used in indoor and outdoor pollution treatments
in the future due to the fact that secondary pollutant emission during
regeneration can be avoided, and thermal energy need not be constantly
supplied (but only be provided at regular intervals) using FexOyHz/Al2O3. This saves energy costs
as compared to the thermal catalysts.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The highly porous spherical
Al2O3 substrate (particle size: 2.0 mm (7 ×
14 Tyler mesh), total pore volume: 0.5 mL/g) was purchased from BASF
(Germany). Bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron (Fe(Cp)2) was purchased
from Sigma Aldrich (USA). Acetaldehyde (200 ppm) diluted with N2 was purchased from JC Gas (Korea).

4.2 Preparation
of FexOyHz-Incorporated
Mesoporous Al2O3
The FexOyHz/Al2O3 catalysts were prepared by
the TR-CVD method.21,43 Bis(cyclopentadienyl)iron (Fe(Cp)2) was used as a metal precursor, and water vapor or oxygen
gas in the reaction chamber was used as the oxidizing agent. Fe(Cp)2 (10, 21, or 67.5 g) in a foil container was located at the
bottom of the box-type stainless-steel chamber (size: 56 × 37
× 9 cm3), and 100 g of Al2O3 loaded in a mesh container was placed in the middle of the chamber.
Different amounts of Fe(Cp)2 resulted in various Fe loadings
on Al2O3. The chamber was equipped with a heating
band, k-type thermocouple, temperature controller, and power supply.
For the TR-CVD process, the chamber was closed with a lid and space
between the chamber body, and the lid was sealed with a polyimide
(PI) tape. First, the chamber was heated to 60 °C for evaporation
of the iron precursor (Fe(Cp)2), and this temperature was
maintained for 2 h. After 2 h, the temperature of the chamber was
further raised to 200 °C, and this temperature was then maintained
for 12 h to deposit FexOyHz nanoparticles on the internal
surface of porous Al2O3 substrates. After the
TR-CVD process, the FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3 sample was preannealed at 450 °C for 8 h under a dry
air flow of 30 mL/min to remove carbon impurities on the surface of
the sample. The preannealing time for the sample was adjusted on the
basis of the level of carbon impurities on the surface of the sample;
that is, annealing was carried out at this temperature and under dry
air until no CO2 desorption could be identified.

4.3 Characterization of Materials
The
surface area and average pore diameter of the samples were analyzed
by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) methods based on N2 isotherms (3Flex, Micromeritics).
The FexOyHz/Al2O3 sample was analyzed
by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM, JEOL, JEM-ARM200F)
equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) to confirm the
dispersion of FexOyHz nanoparticles on the Al2O3 substrate. XRD spectra were obtained using an
X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Ultima IV) using Cu Kα radiation
(40 kV, 30 mA, λ = 1.54 A) with a scanning rate of 4°/min.21 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM-7100F)
equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) was used to analyze
the elemental distribution of cross-sectional planes of FexOyHz/Al2O3. Fe loading was analyzed
by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES, Varian). Also, the chemical states of elements of the FexOyHz/Al2O3 were analyzed by X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). For the XPS analysis, the FexOyHz/Al2O3 sample prior to preannealing
was located in a furnace inside a glove box filled with Ar, and it
was annealed at 450 °C under a dry air flow of 30 mL/min for
8 h. After the annealing process, the sample was transferred from
the glove box to an ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) system using a magnetic
transfer system without exposing the sample to the air. XPS analysis
proceeded under UHV conditions with a base pressure of 3 × 10–10 Torr.20,21,44 The Mg Kα X-ray line (1253.6 eV) was used as the photon source
for XPS. XPS spectra were collected at a pass energy of 30 eV by a
concentric hemisphere analyzer (CHA, PHOIBOS-HAS 3500, SPECS).

The hyperfine interaction and site occupancy of magnetic ions of
the FexOyHz/Al2O3 sample were investigated
by 57Fe Mössbauer spectroscopy at −268.95
°C and room temperature. Mössbauer spectra were recorded
by using a conventional spectrometer of the electromechanical type
with a single 57Co γ-ray source in an Rh matrix,
which was calibrated by using an α-Fe foil. The source was accelerated
through a range of velocities from −12 to 12 mm/s using a driving
unit to produce a Doppler effect and scanned the γ-ray energy.
Mössbauer spectra were analyzed by a least-squares fitting
procedure, and we obtained the relative area ratio of various Fe sites,
magnetic hyperfine field (Hhf), isomer
shift (δ), and electric quadrupole splitting (EQ).

4.4 Catalytic Activity Test
The catalytic
activity of FexOyHz/Al2O3 for acetaldehyde
oxidation was tested with a flow-type system consisting of a quartz
tube (internal diameter of 21 mm, length of 300 mm) reactor, temperature
controller, mass flow controller (MFC), and gas chromatograph (GC,
Hewlett Packard, HP 6890) equipped with a capillary column (Agilent
Technologies, HP-PLOT/Q, 30 m × 0.53 mm), methanizer, and flame
ionization detector. Here, 1.0 g of FexOyHz-deposited
Al2O3 was used as catalysts for the acetaldehyde
oxidation experiment. The catalyst was in a quartz boat (internal
size: 70 × 20 × 8 mm3) placed in the center of
the quartz tube.

Before the acetaldehyde oxidation experiments,
each FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3 sample was preannealed at 450 °C for 8 h under a dry air flow
condition of 30 mL/min until the removal of all carbon impurities
on the surface of the catalyst was achieved. After the preannealing
step, the catalytic activities of the samples as a function of reaction
temperature were analyzed.

The temperature of the reactor was
maintained at 450 °C, and
then the reagent gas, that is, 160 ppm acetaldehyde gas diluted by
dry air with a total flow rate of 20 mL/min (200 ppm acetaldehyde
gas diluted with N2 with 16 mL/min + O2 gas
of 4 mL/min; flow rate of each gas was regulated by MFC), was fed
into the reactor. After the acetaldehyde flow was stabilized, the
reactor temperature decreased from 450 to 50 °C at a rate of
1 °C/min. The concentrations of acetaldehyde and CO2 in the outlet of the reactor with catalysts were analyzed using
an online GC. For these experiments, samples with Fe loadings of 3,
6, and 10 wt % were used.

The catalytic activity of the sample
with Fe loading of 10 wt %
was also measured at a constant reaction temperature of 250 °C
as a function of time for 24 h. After the preannealing process, the
temperature of the reactor was maintained at 250 °C, and the
reagent gas was fed into the reactor with the previously mentioned
flow rate. After the experiment, 30 mL/min N2 gas was used
for purging the reactor for 1 h at 250 °C, and temperature programmed
oxidation (TPO) experiments over used catalysts were subsequently
conducted to determine the amount of remaining carbon species on the
surface of catalysts. For TPO, the temperature of the reactor was
raised from 250 to 450 °C at a ramping rate of 1 °C/min
under a dry air flow of 30 mL/min.

4.5 Temperature
Programmed Desorption
To elucidate the effects of FexOyHz on the catalytic
activity of acetaldehyde oxidation, temperature programmed desorption
(TPD) experiments of acetaldehyde from bulk Al2O3 and FexOyHz/Al2O3 were performed.
To the reactor, 1.0 g of Al2O3 and 1.0 g of
FexOyHz/Al2O3 were added and
annealed at 450 °C for 2 h under a dry air flow of 30 mL/min
to remove surface impurities. After this preannealing step, the reactor
temperature was cooled to 30 °C, and 200 mol ppm acetaldehyde
diluted with balanced N2 gas with a flow rate 10 mL/min
for 60 h was applied to allow acetaldehyde adsorption on the surface.
Subsequently, acetaldehyde in the reactor was purged by a N2 flow of 30 mL/min. Then, the reactor temperature was increased from
30 to 450 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/min under N2 flow. The gas mixture that had passed through the reactor during
TPD experiments was analyzed by an identical GC system as was used
for the aforementioned catalytic activity experiments.

4.6 Adsorption of Acetaldehyde at Room-Temperature
and Thermal Oxidative Regeneration
The potential use of FexOyHz/Al2O3 as a recyclable adsorbent
for acetaldehyde was tested using experiments consisting of near-room-temperature
adsorption of acetaldehyde on FexOyHz/Al2O3 and its thermal oxidative regeneration at various humidity
conditions. The experiments were tested with a stainless-steel reactor
(inner diameter of 1/2 in., length of 5 cm).
The gas preparation stage comprised three mass flow controllers (MFCs)
and a bottle filled with distilled water (Figure S6). Humidity of the reagent gas was controlled by the temperature
of the distilled water bottle sealed with heating band (24 °C
(30% RH), 58.5 °C (50% RH), and 69.5 °C (70% RH)). Before
the acetaldehyde oxidation experiments, 1 g of FexOyHz-deposited Al2O3, which has 10 wt % Fe loading,
was preannealed at 450 °C for 8 h under a dry air flow condition
of 30 mL/min. After the preannealing process, the temperature of the
reactor containing the sample was cooled down to 30 °C, and this
temperature was maintained. Then, the reagent gas, that is, 107 ppm
acetaldehyde gas diluted by either dry air or air with various humidity
levels with a total flow rate of 30 mL/min (200 ppm acetaldehyde gas
diluted with N2 with 16 mL/min + O2 gas of 4
mL/min + air with humidity of 10 mL/min; flow rate of each gas was
regulated by MFC), was fed into the reactor for 12 h at 30 °C.
Subsequently, purging gas (N2, 30 mL/min) was fed into
the reactor for 1 h to remove any weakly bound acetaldehyde from the
surface of the sample. After the purging process, TPO over the FexOyHz/Al2O3 was performed. The reactor
temperature was increased from 30 to 450 °C at a rate of 1 °C/min
under air, with the humidity used for the respective adsorption experiment
with a total flow of 30 mL/min (N2 gas of 16 mL/min + O2 gas of 4 mL/min + air with humidity of 10 mL/min) during
the TPO.
