Humidity-control
materials have attracted increasing attention
because of energy savings and smart regulation of indoor comforts.
The current research is a successive work to face challenges, such
as poor performance, limitations for large-scale production, and surface
contamination. Here, we report a smart humidity-control wall-brick
manufactured from sepiolite using CaCl2 as an additive.
Low-temperature sintering generated a super hygroscopic interior structure,
and further silane modification produced bricks with superhydrophobic
surfaces. These superhydrophobic surfaces can promote the moisture
storage and prevent the CaCl2 solution from leaking even
after the surface is wiped 100 times. Meanwhile, the superhydrophobic
surfaces make the wall-bricks easy to clean; also, these materials
possess antifouling and antifungal properties. The 24 h and saturated
moisture adsorption–desorption contents reached 630 and 1700
g·m–2, respectively. Furthermore, a test was
performed using model houses in a real environment, which indicates
that the wall-bricks can narrow the daily indoor humidity fluctuations
by more than 20% in both wet and dry seasons. The white wall-brick
can also be dyed with different colors and thus shows promise for
applications in interior decorations of houses.

1 Introduction
In nature, creatures have the capability to construct and exist
in a comfortable living environment. For example, ants build a porous
nest for temperature and humidity regulation.1,2 For
mankind, indoor comfort has always been a pursuit that has been achieved
by controlling the temperature, humidity, air quality, etc.3−5 Among these comforts, the relative humidity (RH, where the preferable
range is 40–70%) of indoor air has attracted increasing concerns
because it relates to long-term health.

Humidity-control materials
(HCMs) can save energy by regulating
the air humidity intelligently. Recently, metal–organic frameworks,6,7 porous organic polymers,8,9 hydrogels,10 and natural inorganic porous materials (NPMs)11−14 have been developed to fabricate a variety of HCMs. Among these
materials, NPMs have aroused widespread interest because they are
durable and inexpensive and can be used in large-scale applications
in buildings.

However, the ability of NPMs to control humidity
is usually limited
and incomparable with the above-mentioned synthetic materials. In
general, the moisture adsorption–desorption content of NPM-based
materials is only approximately 2–10% of their own weight,13−15 which is much lower than that of the Y-shp-MOF59 (30–40%) and Zn–O hydrogels (230%).10

We recently demonstrated that CaCl2 could improve the
ability of an NPM to control humidity by enhancing the capillary condensation
in mesopores.16 However, excessive CaCl2 leaks when the NPM is exposed to moist environments for long periods restricts
our ability to further enhance the moisture adsorption–desorption
contents of the HCM. In addition, particulate matter pollution has
become a serious problem in some developing countries.17−19 The particulates may reduce the ability of a material to control
humidity and contaminate the HCM surface by blocking pores with floating
dust. Because HCMs are porous, determining how to clean HCMs is another
key issue of their long-term use.

Antiwetting can prevent liquid
permeation; thus, an antiwetting
surface is easy to clean, as dirt can be removed by running water
droplets.20−23 Antiwetting surface treatments are a promising technology for solving
the problem of CaCl2 leakage and can be used to clean the
HCM surfaces; as a result, these HCMs with antiwetting surfaces have
excellent ability to control humidity and have a long service life.
However, the breathability of this kind of materials was less of a
priority. The in situ preparation of the surface texture provides
a perfect solution for achieving hydrophobic materials that are both
breathable and durable.24

Herein,
we present the preparation of a wall-brick with superhydrophobic
surfaces via a common sintering process and facile fluoride silane
decoration. The mesopores and CaCl2 in the brick can automatically
absorb or desorb moisture by responding to changes in the environmental
humidity, while macropores store moisture in wet seasons and act as
diffusion channels in dry seasons. The 24 h moisture adsorption–desorption
content and the maximum moisture storage content reach 630 and 1700
g·m–2, representing an increase of 15 and 90%
compared to our previous study, respectively.16 The superhydrophobic surfaces also make the wall-brick an easy-to-clean,
antifouling, and antifungal material. The wall-brick possesses an
excessive 90% whiteness and can be dyed to be colorful. Thus, this
wall-brick has promise for application as a functional interior decoration
in houses.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structural
Features and Chemical Composition
Figure 1A shows
the scheme used to fabricate the humidity-control wall-brick containing
sepiolite, a kind of NPM (Figure S1), where
CaCl2 was used as an additive. The hierarchical porous
and micro/nanosized rough-surface structures were constructed using
a common sintering process. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images reveal a hierarchical structure and confirm that adding CaCl2 changes the morphology from flat (Figure 1B) to rod-shaped sepiolite crystals25,26 (Figure 1C,D). Two
endothermic peaks are present in the DSC curves (Figure 1E) and are attributed to two
weight-loss events: the event occurring below 200 °C corresponds
to the adsorbed water and some crystallized water in CaCl2·6H2O and CaCl2·2H2O,
while the event occurring between 500 and 800 °C corresponds
to the decomposition of slaked lime and volatilization of CaCl2 (8.23% weight loss; Figure S2, Table S1). The alkali activation and volatilization weaken the sintering
effect of the sepiolite fibers, giving rise to the previously mentioned
developed rod-shaped nanostructure.27 After
sintering, CaCl2 remained in the brick, as shown in the
XRD results. The elemental mappings (Figure 1F) show that Ca and Cl do not segregate and
are instead homogeneously distributed in the interfiber mesopores
or on the surface of the sepiolite fibers.

curves are denoted by solid lines and TG curves are denoted by dash
lines. (F) TEM image and the EDS mappings results.

The pore size distributions and pore volume are directly
correlated
to the capillary condensation and the influence of the moisture adsorption–desorption
content of the material.28−30Table 1 shows that the mesopore volume and specific
surface area decreased by adding CaCl2. Further measurements
(Figure S3) show that the number of mesopores
with diameters less than 15 nm decreased, which is possibly caused
by CaCl2 occupying the mesopores (Figure 1F). Although the nitrogen-adsorption capacity
is weakened, once moisture is absorbed, CaCl2 can deliquesce,
forming a CaCl2 solution that exists in the mesopores.
Thus, the moisture adsorption–desorption content increases
because of the enhanced capillary condensation in the pores and the
inherent physisorption capacity of the material.16,31,32 The porosity and median macropore diameter
are 36.6% and 402 nm, respectively.

2.2 Superhydrophobic and Antileakage Property
The surface micro/nanostructures on the wall-brick surface were
constructed in situ during sintering; thus, the liquid on the surface
of the wall-brick may exist in the Cassie–Baxter state. Stable
air pockets may exist in the rough interstices between the droplets
and the surfaces, leading to a composite liquid–vapor–solid
interface. A superhydrophobic surface can be obtained facilely by
spraying the surface with hydrolytic PFOTS. In the high-resolution
XPS patterns (Figure S4), the peaks attributed
to F, −CF2, and −CF3 groups were
detected, meaning that the brick surface was successfully coated with
PFOTS.33,34 The CA is 155°, which agrees well with
the value calculated using the Cassie–Baxter model, as shown
in Figure S5. It is an obvious enhancement
compared to the flat surface (without CaCl2; Table 1). The sliding angle (SA) decreases
as the density decreases because the surface roughness is strongly
affected by the density of the wall-brick (Figure S6). Nevertheless, the wall-brick must be mechanically robust
for practical applications. A suitable density of wall-brick is approximately
1.5 g·cm–3, and the flexural strength is in
excess of 10 MPa. The corresponding sliding angle is less than 10°.
The dynamic antiwetting behavior of the wall-brick against water droplets
can be further observed in the movies presented in the Supporting
Information (Movies S1 and S2).

Indeed,
to achieve a long service life, the durability of the hydrophobic
layer is a critical issue. Hence, nonwoven fabrics were used to wipe
the brick surface 100 times (Figure 2B). Figure 2A shows that the water/oil droplets maintained their spherical
shape on the surface of the wall-brick, and the surface morphologies
observed using SEM showed that they maintained their micro/nanostructures
(Figure S7). The water contact angles of
the treated surface are somewhat decreased; meanwhile, the sliding
angles increased to approximately 65° (Figure 2B). Thanks to the in situ generated, rough,
hierarchical microstructure constructed by sintering, the wall-brick
retained its hydrophobicity even after 100 wipes. Regarding the low-surface-tension
oil (Figure 2Aa–c),
we observed that the treated wall-brick exhibited much slower impregnation
dynamics than the pristine hydrophilic wall-brick. Thus, sufficient
interval was provided for cleaning to occur (Figure S8).

wipes. The photos shown in (a–c) were taken 2 min after the

(C) Digital images of the high-humidity leakage test used to characterize
the superhydrophobic character of the wall-brick. (D) Schematic diagram
illustrating high-humidity leakage, where the top row shows a superhydrophobic
material (green coating) and the bottom row shows a superhydrophilic
material.

Superhydrophobic surfaces allow
the CaCl2 solution to
be held inside the wall-brick because of the Laplace pressure.35,36 The CaCl2 solution has a larger surface tension than
that of pure water, generating a greater force between the gas–liquid
interfaces (Table S2). A leakage test shows
that, in contrast to pristine hydrophilic surface (Figure S9), hardly any leakage appeared in the superhydrophobic
specimen even after 100 wipes (Figure 2C). Figure 2D reveals a schematic diagram depicting the ability of the
superhydrophobic surface to prevent the CaCl2 solution
from leaking and to promote moisture storage. Moisture can be alternatively
adsorbed or desorbed on the wall-brick depending on the changes in
the environmental humidity, and the macropores work as accelerated
channels for moisture diffusion. When the wall-brick is exposed to
moist environments for long periods, the adsorption contents exceed
the carrying capacity of the mesopores in the brick. The CaCl2 solution leakage occurred for the pristine hydrophilic specimen.
In contrast, the superhydrophobic layer can prevent the excess CaCl2 solution from leaking outside and instead stores this excess
CaCl2 solution in the macropores.

2.3 Humidity-Control
Property
The wall-brick
prepared in this study has an excellent ability to control humidity
owing to the synergy of the hierarchical porous structure and CaCl2 in the wall-brick. Since PFOTS was graft directly to the
superficial rod-shaped crystals, the initial breathability of the
wall-brick was maintained. Using 9 wt % CaCl2 as an additive,
the 24 h moisture adsorption–desorption content reached 630
g·m–2 at RH of 92–33%, which is almost
equal to that of the pristine hydrophilic specimen (Figure 3A, S9). Figure 3B shows
steady moisture adsorption/desorption cycles, and the wall-brick is
shown to maintain its working capacity in a moisture content in the
range of 280–320 g·m–2 every 8 h with
a contact angle (CA) of ≥150°. When the wall-brick was
exposed to abundant moisture (4 days in an environment with RH of
92%), the moisture adsorption–desorption content was nearly
saturated and reached 1700 g·m–2 (Figure 3C), and was maintained
at that level even after 9 cycles (Figure S10). This means that the macropores were completely used to store moisture.
In contrast, a leakage occurred for the pristine hydrophilic specimen,
which is denoted by a dash-dotted circle in Figure 3C, and only 150 g·m–2 was observed for the specimen prepared without CaCl2.

test result. The left of the axis break shows the RH fluctuations
of the two model houses, in which the RHs differ by approximately
2%. To the right of the axis break is the RH records. The dotted lines
indicate the temperature variations in the two houses.

With a high moisture adsorption–desorption content,
the
practical humidity-control property of the wall-brick was investigated.
For a wall-brick (50 mm × 20 mm × 4.5 mm) in a closed space
(1 L), the RH was nearly constant at both low and high temperatures
(Figure S11). Furthermore, a simulation
test was performed using two model houses (Figure 3D), which were placed outdoors at the Shanghai
University. The wall-bricks (with total area = 0.12 m2)
were put into the test house (0.45 m3 volume), and the
other house was kept empty and used as a control. The tests were performed
from October 14 to November 15, 2018 (wet season) and from February
26 to March 22, 2019 (dry season). In Figure 3E, the temperature variation of the two model
houses was almost the same. Therefore, we believe that the difference
in the “indoor humidity” between the two model houses
mainly resulted from the ability of the wall-bricks to control humidity.
The daily humidity in the test house did not fluctuate as much as
it did in the control house, and the daily humidity fluctuation was
narrowed by more than 20% RH. The wall-bricks work well in both wet
and dry seasons, which is compelling for practical applications in
humidity control.

2.4 Ease of Cleaning and Antifouling
Property
The superhydrophobic surface of the wall-brick prevents
the inside
CaCl2 solution from leaking outside; meanwhile, the wall-brick
surface can resist foreign dirt. Figure 4A,B shows the wall-bricks treated to perform
dirt removal and antifouling tests, where half of the surface was
treated with superhydrophobic modification (Movies S3 and S4). The superhydrophobic side can be cleaned by removing
dirt (MnO2) with water droplets, while the pristine hydrophilic
side is still dirty. The superhydrophobic surface can also protect
the wall-brick against potential daily exposure to contaminants including
water-based dyes, coffee, soy sauce, and cooking oils.

where water was used to clean the brick.
(B) A water-based dye, coffee, and soy sauce were used in the antifouling
test. (C) Antifungal activity test: the top specimen is the control
filter paper, the bottom specimen is the wall-brick prepared without
CaCl2, the right specimen is the pristine hydrophilic wall-brick
prepared with 9% CaCl2, and the left specimen is the superhydrophobic
wall-brick prepared with 9% CaCl2. The magnified images
of the specimens on the left, right, and bottom after 14 days are
shown in (a), (b), and (c), respectively.

Aspergillus niger, a common fungus
present on moist walls, was used to assess the antifungal activity
of the wall-brick. Figure 4C shows photographs of the cultivating fungi. After 14 days
at an RH of 85%, the culture medium and the control filter paper were
covered with black fungi. Hardly any fungus was observed on the wall-brick
prepared with CaCl2 (Figure 4Ca,b). However, the CaCl2 solution leaked
from the pristine hydrophilic wall-brick and led to a sterile area,
as depicted by the red dashed line. In contrast, nearly 30% of the
surface of the brick prepared without CaCl2 was colonized
by Aspergillus niger. The hierarchical
structures trap air into the nanoscale interstices of the superhydrophobic
surfaces; as a result, only a small interaction area exists between
the spore liquid and the substrate,37,38 which restricts
spore growth. In addition, the antifungal activity of the CaCl2 solution39 can further dehydrate
the few spores that contact the substrate; thus, the spores die because
of the high concentration (approximately 23 wt %; Table S2) at a 85% RH. The dual effects make the wall-brick
a perfect antifungal material.

It is highly desirable that superhydrophobic
wall-bricks capable
of humidity control be processed into various colors and patterns
for interior decoration in houses. Basic white bricks were obtained
after sintering, and the reflectance spectrum in the visible-light
region was obtained for the white bricks, as shown in Figure 5A. The whiteness of the wall-brick
was in excess of 90%. Correspondingly, Figure 5B shows the whiteness of the wall-brick.
By spraying commercial dyes on the surface before hydrophobic modification,
wall-bricks with different colors, such as pink, orange, yellow, green,
blue, and purple, can be fabricated (Figure 5C). Additionally, colorful patterns can be
easily drawn on the humidity-control wall-bricks by spraying or using
other commercial printing methods (Figure 5D).

3 Conclusions
We prepared a wall-brick that
can achieve indoor humidity control
without consuming energy. A hierarchical structure was generated in
situ during sintering. CaCl2 was added to the wall-brick
material to enhance the ability of the resulting material to control
humidity. The daily adsorption–desorption content of the wall-brick
reached 450 and 630 g·m–2 at RH of 33–75
and 33–92%, respectively. A superhydrophobic surface prevents
the CaCl2 solution from leaking during long-term exposure
to high-humidity environments and ensures that the material achieves
great humidity control. Meanwhile, these superhydrophobic surfaces
endow the wall-bricks with antifouling and antifungal properties and
make the wall-bricks easy to clean. The flexural strength is in excess
of 10 MPa. Therefore, these wall-bricks are promising for use as functional
interior decorations in houses.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
Sepiolite
was obtained from Henan Province (China). 1H,1H,2H,2H-Perfluorooctyltrimethoxysilane
(PFOTS) was purchased from Weng Jiang Reagent Co., Ltd., (China).
All other chemicals used in this experiment were of analytical grade
and used without further purification.

4.2 Fabrication
of the Wall-Brick
The
pristine hydrophilic wall-brick was fabricated by a common procedure
reported in the literature.16 In short,
sepiolite was activated by HCl (3 mol·L–1).
Subsequently, CaCl2 and 20 wt % low-melting point glass
powder (the compositions are shown in Table S1) were added to the activated sepiolite. The mixture was adjusted
to a pH of 10 using a NaOH solution (5 mol·L–1) and separated by filtering. The precursor powders were dried and
pressed at a pressure of 8 MPa, and then the pressed powders were
sintered at 700 °C for 40 min in a common electric-heated furnace.
The thickness of the specimen was approximately 4.5 mm. The CaCl2 contents in the specimen were estimated from the XRF data,
and are shown in Table S1.

4.3 Superhydrophobic Modification
PFOTS,
0.5 g, was dissolved in 20 g of alcohol. Then, 0.1 g of acetic acid
(30% aqueous solution) was added to the above-mentioned mixture. After
stirring for 30 min at 30 °C, the hydrolytic PFOTS was sprayed
directly onto the surface of the specimen using compressed air.

4.4 Dyeing of the Wall-Brick
After sintering,
the wall-brick was dyed by repeatedly spraying commercial dyes (rose
bengal, methyl orange, brilliant yellow, brilliant green, methyl blue,
and crystal violet) on the brick surface and maintaining the brick
at 80 °C for 3 days.

4.5 Moisture Adsorption–Desorption
and
Simulation Test
The moisture adsorption–desorption
properties of the wall-brick were measured by a humidity response
apparatus according to Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS A1470-1,
2008). The specimens were covered with aluminum foil so that the moisture
could only exit through the top surface. During the test process,
the specimen was placed in a homothermal bottle and weighed every
10 min. A hygrothermograph (TH12R-EX, Miao xin Co., Ltd, China) was
used to monitor the RH in the bottle. Two model houses with 0.45 m3 of space were used for a simulation test. The variations
of the temperature and relative humidity inside the two model houses
were recorded every 20 min.

4.6 CaCl2 Solution
Leakage Test
The wall-brick was put on alkaline litmus papers
(Φ = 70 mm)
and placed in an airtight vessel. At 25 °C, an environment with
RH of 92% was constructed by a saturated KNO3 solution.
After 4 days and appearance of a leakage, the CaCl2 solution
(pH 5–6) touched the litmus paper, whose color then changed
from blue to red.

4.7 Antifouling Test
The antifouling
test was carried out according to China’s Nation Standard (GB/T
1741-2007). The wall-bricks were placed in a potato-agar culture medium
at 28 °C and RH of 85%. Aspergillus niger spore liquid was sprayed on the surface and allowed to cultivate
for 14 days.

4.8 Characterization of the
Samples and Instruments
The crystal structures and compositions
were characterized by X-ray
diffraction (3kw-D/MAX2500V, Rigaku) using a Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 1.5406 Å), where the data were collected at a scanning
rate of 4°/min, and X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF-1800,
Shimadzu). TG-DSC measurements were performed using a NETZSCH thermal
analyzer, where the samples were heated at 5 °C/min in air. X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were performed using
a Thermo ESCALAB 250XI equipped with a monochromatic Al Kα X-ray
source. The microstructure and surface morphology were examined by
scanning electron microscopy (using an FEI JFM-7500F scanning electron
microscope) and an optical profiler (Contour GT-K, Bruker). The surface
area and mesopore analyses were performed using a nitrogen gas sorption
porosity analyzer (Autosorb-IQ2, Quantachrome). The porosity and macropore
size distribution were obtained by mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP,
AutoPore Iv 9510, Micromeritics). The CA and SA were measured with
water droplets at room temperature using a JCY-2 instrument (Fangrui,
China). The three-point flexural strengths of the sintered samples
were measured with a strength testing machine at a loading rate of
2 N/s (Instron-5566, 10 kN).
