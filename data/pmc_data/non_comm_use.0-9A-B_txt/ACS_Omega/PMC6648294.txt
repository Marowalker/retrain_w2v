We report the synthesis of a structurally
diverse amphiphilic dendrimer
with oxidation and ultraviolet light-sensitive groups incorporated
in the dendrimer interior. Convergent synthesis is utilized by reacting
branched repeating units with a nonbranched functional molecule by
two synthetic strategies, Passerini multicomponent reaction and azide–alkyne
cycloaddition reaction. The periphery of dendrimer was functionalized
by methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) to obtain a dendrimer with a hydrophobic
core and hydrophilic peripheral chains. The G2-PEG dendrimer characterized
by NMR, GPC, and MALDI-TOF MS for structural integrity and oxidation-
and photo-triggered degradations of the G2-PEG dendrimer was investigated.
The self-assembled morphology of the dendrimer in the presence of
organic dye was also investigated by TEM and DLS analyses, together
with dissipative particle dynamics simulation. The encapsulation of
dye molecules in self-assembled nanospheres of the dendrimer and their
responsive releases, triggered by the efficient disassembly of a dendrimer,
have been demonstrated.

Introduction
Dendrimers are the
class of synthetic polymers with a globular,
well-defined branched structure with properties such as monodispersion,
nanosize with a high density of surface functionality, internal cavities
for guest encapsulation, and low intrinsic viscosity in solution.1,2 These properties of dendrimers make them an excellent choice for
biomedical applications with suitable type and generation.3−5 Vögtle and co-workers6 first synthesized
a dendrimer termed as cascade molecules in 1978; later on, Denkewalter,
Tomalia, Newkome, Frechet, and co-workers independently carried out
pioneering works for further development with a high order of complexity
of these branched molecules and termed as dendrimers.7−10 Despite the progress of a dendrimer with improved features, the
currently used dendrimers are nondegradable under physiological conditions,
causing accumulation in cells and tissues, which induces cytotoxicity.11−13 The development of new synthetic methods such as orthogonal click
chemistry, Michael reaction, multicomponent reactions, etc. in combination
with convergent and divergent approaches provides excellent flexibility
for construction of heterofunctional dendrimers14−21 with structural sophistication to meet current and future needs
for therapeutic applications as well as drug and gene delivery.

Nanocarriers with more than one stimuli-responsive group are of
great importance toward targeted, programmed, and controlled drug
delivery by imparting into them the ability to respond to different
environmental conditions to enhance their efficacy toward drug delivery.22−27 Among others, the nanocarriers responsive to reactive oxygen species
(ROS)28−30 and ultraviolet (UV) light31,32 can act as promising theranostic agents for targeted delivery. The
ROS-cleavable groups incorporated in the polymer backbone in response
to stimuli degrade the bulk polymer into small molecules or change
the amphiphilicity of the nanocarrier, resulting in disassembly with
the release of encapsulate. In the literature, the polymer nanocarriers
with oxidation-sensitive groups such as aryl boronic ester, thioether
groups, polysulfides, and polyselenides reported disassembly either
by degradation or solubility change.33 Most
recently, aryl boronic ester sensitive to H2O2 oxidation was demonstrated with cleavage of the ester linkage.34 Along with this, light has gained attention
as a stimulus since it can be applied with spatiotemporal precision
without the use of reagents.35 The degradation
of assembly is directly proportional to irradiation time and light
intensity; hence, incorporated a wide range of light-responsive moieties
in the polymer architectures.31,32 For drug delivery applications,
the stimuli-responsive groups in suitable polymer architecture capable
of forming self-assembled nanoparticles with low polydispersity and
high payload capacity are crucial.36−40 The nanocarriers formed by dendritic amphiphiles
are superior in terms of morphology and properties over micelles of
linear surfactants.41,42

Passerini multicomponent
reaction (P-MCR) is getting the attention
of scientists working in the field of polymer chemistry because of
catalyst-free ambient reaction conditions with high yields and simple
purification methods. This P-MCR allows the easy way to incorporate
environment-sensitive functional groups in the polymer backbone. A
range of functional polymers are synthesized by P-MCR with structural
diversity by a combination of monomers. Polymer architectures such
as linear copolymers,34,43,44 hyperbranched polymers,45 and dendrimers20 are successfully synthesized with a controlled
molecular weight (MW). However, there are very few reports published
for dendrimers with functional groups placed in the interior46,47 due to synthetic challenges to work on two fronts: (1) growing dendrimer
generations by incorporation of branching units and, at the same time,
(2) introducing stimuli-responsive groups. P-MCR and click chemistry
inspired us to design a synthetic methodology for a stimuli-responsive
degradable dendrimer. We incorporated a chemically distinct ROS-responsive
aryl boronic ester and UV-responsive o-nitrobenzyl
groups in each generation of dendrimer so that, upon application of
one stimulus, the other should remain intact to achieve stepwise degradation
of the dendrimer. The dendrimer was confirmed by NMR and MALDI-TOF
characterization for structural integrity. The degradation of the
dendrimer at the aryl boronic ester position was achieved upon application
of H2O2 as stimuli and, at the o-nitrobenzyl ester position, by UV irradiation. The degradation products
were characterized by GPC, 1H NMR, and UV–Vis spectroscopy.

Results
and Discussion
Dendrimer synthesis consists of hydrophobic
repeating units with
peripheral hydrophilic methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) (MPEG; MW = 600)
chains to impart amphiphilicity in the macromolecule (Scheme 1). The stimuli-responsive groups
such as o-nitrobenzyl (ONB), which is sensitive to
UV light, and phenylboronic acid, which is responsive to oxidation,
were incorporated, considering the significant difference in their
cleavage rate to get control over degradation kinetics. The synthesis
was achieved by stepwise manner, starting from P-MCR between a pinacol
ester of 4-formylphenylboronic acid, 2-methyl-3-(prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)-2-((prop-2-yn-1-yloxy)methyl)propanoic
acid (bis-MPA-dialkyne), and 1,6-diisocyanohexane in chloroform at
30 °C following the reported reaction conditions.34 This results in the formation of a G0.5 dendrimer
by ester–amide linkage with four terminal alkyne groups with
an 80% isolated yield. The G-1 ONB–aldehyde dendrimer was formed
by copper-catalyzed azide–alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) between
the G0.5 alkyne functional dendrimer and 5-(2-azidoethoxy)-2-nitrobenzaldehyde
using tris[(1-benzyl-1H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methyl]amine
(TBTA) and Cu(I)I as a catalytic system. The pure G1 aldehyde dendrimer
with four terminal formyl groups was obtained by silica gel column
chromatography (78% yield). The second P-MCR between G1 aldehyde,
2,2-bis-MPA-dialkyne, and t-butyl isocyanide was
performed in CH2Cl2 at 25 °C to get UV-responsive
ONB moiety incorporated in the G-1.5 alkyne dendrimer with eight terminal
alkyne groups (68% yield). Finally, a CuAAC click reaction between
the G-1.5 dendrimer and MPEG–N3 was conducted using
TBTA and Cu(I)I as a catalytic system in DMF at 25 °C for 18
h to get the amphiphilic G2-PEG dendrimer (62% yield). The dendrimer
composed of 60% by weight of hydrophilic peripheral ethylene glycol
chains and 40% hydrophobic part by weight as the core of the dendrimer. 1H NMR and 13C NMR characterized all dendrimer intermediate
generations, and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization–time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (Figures S1–S18 in the Supporting Information) and FT-IR (Figure S19 in the Supporting Information).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of G2-PEG
Dendrimer by a Series of Passerini Multicomponent
Reactions and Click Reactions
The dendrimer is composed of interior heterofunctional
stimuli-responsive
groups and hydrophilic peripheral MPEG chains. 1H NMR spectrum
(Figure S10 in the Supporting Information)
and MALDI-TOF MS analysis (Figure 1) shows the structural integrity and purity of the
G2-PEG dendrimer. In the 1H NMR spectrum, the integration
of PEG chains and all other peaks such as newly formed methylene proton
peaks are precisely matching with expected integrations. The MALDI-TOF
MS analyses of all dendrimer generations show lines for a fragmentation
product along with molecular ion peaks. The dendrimer generations
show fragmentation at phenylboronic ester–amide linkage with
breakage of the bond between benzylic carbon and oxygen (PhCH–O)
and cleavage of benzylic (PhCH–O) bond from the ONB group.
Here, we explicitly mention that, in the presence of H2O2 and upon UV irradiation, the ester bonds, not PhCH–O
bonds, were cleaved (Figure 1). For an explanation, the G1.5 alkyne dendrimer MALDI-TOF
MS spectrum is shown in Figure 1 with fragmentation peaks. The first fragmentation peak appears
at 1869.96 g/mol by a cleavage bond between benzylic carbon atoms
corresponding to the phenylboronic acid group, resulting in a cationic
fragment that was detected by the MALDI-TOF MS spectrum. Another major
fragmentation peak appears at 1098.60 g/mol by cleavage at the ONB
group. The MALDI-TOF MS spectra for other dendrimer generations are
included in Figures S20–S22 (Supporting
Information).

Figure 1 MALDI-TOF MS spectrum for G 1.5 alkyne.

For the final G2 dendrimer, we also observed fragmentation
peaks
in linear-mode MALDI TOF MS analysis due to cleavage of the dendrimer
with the difference between cleaved populations around 1700 g/mol.
In the case of inefficient click reaction, the difference would be
625 g/mol, indicating that the disintegration of the dendrimer extensively
occurs. Lopp, So, and co-workers reported similar observations for
the PAMAM dendrimer.48−50 The G2-PEG structural purity is also confirmed by
gel permeation chromatography (GPC) (Mn = 8000 g mol–1; polydispersity index (PDI) = 1.01).
The G2-PEG dendrimer is directly soluble in water and many common
organic solvents such as methylene chloride, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran
(THF), dimethylformamide, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

Initially,
we studied the H2O2-triggered
degradation of the dendrimer by 1H NMR spectral analysis.
The dendrimer was dissolved in a mixture of deuterated phosphate buffer
solution (pH 7.4) and DMSO-d6 (10:1).
DMSO-d6 was added for improved solubility
of the dendrimer to detect hydrophobic protons. The excess of H2O2 solution (100 mM) was added and investigated
with time by 1H NMR analysis (Figure 2). In the presence of H2O2, the phenylboronic pinacol ester was hydrolyzed by oxidation
into a phenolic intermediate. As shown in Figure 2B, the 1H NMR spectrum shows an
apparent shift in aromatic protons a and b to upfield regions 1a and
1b. The similar shift is also noted for a benzylic proton at the para
position from phenylboronic acid c at δ 5.8 ppm to 1c at δ
5.65 ppm. The oxidative degradation of the boronic group initiates
the self-immolation process from the phenolic intermediate, resulting
in cleavage of the ester bond from ester–amide linkage into
carboxylic acid and quinone methide. The quinone methide is highly
reactive and is hydrolyzed into a benzyl alcohol derivative.

cleavage mechanism by H2O2 (100
mM) oxidation recorded in D2O and DMSO-d6 (10/2, v/v) at 25 °C. (B) Time-dependent H2O2-responsive degradation of dendrimer followed
by 400 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy.

Further, to confirm dendrimer degradation, G2-PEG in pH 7.4
phosphate
buffer solution was treated with 100 mM H2O2 for 120 min, and the solvents were removed under vacuum. The residual
solid was dissolved in THF and analyzed by GPC (Figure 3A). The GPC curves show degradation of the
dendrimer into half-MW fractions with a shift in a peak at a higher
retention time than the pure dendrimer (Mn = 4000; PDI = 1.05) and are precisely matching with expected MW
by cleavage of two ester linkages in the dendrimer. In this process,
the other ester linkages corresponding to the o-nitrobenzyl
group remain intact with no shift in a peak in the 1H NMR
spectrum corresponding to a benzylic proton at δ 6.5 ppm. The
GPC curve also shows a peak shift to half the MW of the pure dendrimer
instead of many fragmented peaks. These observations strongly suggest
the degradation of the dendrimer by H2O2-triggered
oxidation of phenylboronic moiety, which initiates the self-immolative
process, not direct ester hydrolysis.

for 0.05 wt % G2-PEG after irradiation at different time intervals
by 365 nm light.

Similarly, we studied
the UV response of the o-nitrobenzyl group by UV–Vis
spectroscopy, 1H NMR
spectral analysis, and GPC. To study UV-triggered degradation, an
aqueous solution of G2-PEG dendrimer (0.05 wt %) was irradiated at
365 nm light (100 W lamp) with monitoring over time by UV–Vis
spectroscopy. The decrease in absorption intensity at 277 nm and the
increase at 370 nm is due to the conversion of the nitrobenzyl group
to the corresponding carbonyl group (Figure 3B). To further confirm the degradation of
the dendrimer by GPC, 5 mg of G2-PEG dendrimer in 2 mL of pH 7.4 phosphate
buffer solution was irradiated at 365 nm by UV light for 60 min. In
the GPC curve of the irradiated sample, the peak corresponding to
the pure dendrimer disappears entirely, and new peaks appear at low
MW, indicating degradation of the dendrimer by cleavage of ester linkages
corresponding to ONB groups (Figure 3A).

The photo-triggered degradation of the ester
bond was also followed
by 1H NMR spectroscopy with time (Figure S24). The decrease in the peak area of the benzylic proton
corresponding to the o-nitrobenzyl group was observed
due to the transfer of the proton by a radical mechanism with cleavage
of ester linkage, as shown in the proposed mechanism (Figure S24). In this process, the peak corresponding
to the benzylic proton para to phenylboronic acid remain intact, suggesting
cleavage of ester linkages only corresponding to ONB groups by photoinitiated
radical generation.

After structural characterization and responsive
degradation of
the dendrimer, we studied solution assemblies in aqueous solution,
encapsulation, and responsive release of the model dye Nile red. The
amphiphilic G2-PEG dendrimer with hydrophilic peripheral PEG chains
and internal hydrophobic groups is expected to be self-assembled in
aqueous solution. The 0.5 wt % G2 PEG dendrimer initially was prepared
in water/DMF (9/1, v/v) by stirring at room temperature for 2 h; DLS
analysis showed a particle size in the range of 100 nm and 1–2
μm, suggesting that annealing at higher temperature is needed
to get a uniform morphology (Figure S23, sample a). A 0.5 wt % solution of the dendrimer was prepared by
dissolving the dendrimer in water/DMF (9/1, v/v) solution with constant
stirring at 80 °C for 2 h. The dendrimer solution was slowly
cooled to room temperature and then subjected to dynamic light scattering
(DLS) measurements; it shows solution morphologies with a hydrodynamic
size (Dh) of 100 nm (Figure 5a). Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) revealed G2-PEG self-assembly into spherical micelles in a size
range higher than as seen in DLS analysis, probably due to aggregation
of nanoparticles in the drying process of TEM sample preparation.
The effect of solvent proportion of water/DMF on solution morphology
was studied by following the above sample preparation procedure. The
self-assembled morphologies showed an increase in size with water/DMF
(7/3, v/v) and water/DMF (5/5, v/v), whereas no self-assembly occurred
in pure DMF solution (Figure S23, samples
b–d).

To understand the formation of micelles in the
absence and presence
of a sample hydrophobic drug, Nile red, dissipative particle dynamics
(DPD) simulations were conducted for the system consisting of the
dendrimer, Nile red, and mixed solvents of water and DMF. The mass
and volume of each bead is 108 amu and 180 Å3, respectively,
and the cutoff radius rc between two beads
is 8.14 Å. In the DPD method, a set of soft interacting beads
that is large on the atomistic scale but is still macroscopically
small is used to simulate a fluid system. The underlying principle
of DPD theory is well-described in previous reports.51−53 The DPD bead-spring model is parameterized by setting up the interactions
between all different species. The DPD interaction parameters are
obtained in two steps: a determination of the Flory–Huggins
interaction parameters, followed by a conversion to DPD parameters.
Here, the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter (χij) was calculated from the solubility parameters 1  where R is
the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature,
and v is the volume per mole beads. The DPD repulsion
parameters aij can be related to the Flory–Huggins
solubility parameter for a density value, in reduced units, of 3 as
follows49,50 2  where the aij values are in reduced units. As illustrated
in Figure 4a, the eight-arm
polymer consists of nine types of beads (A to I), and Nile red consists
of three types of beads (K, L, and M); also, the solubility parameter
of each bead is derived by using Synthia or cohesive energy density
calculations using Forcite Plus, COMPASS, and Amorphous Cell in Materials
Studio 5.0 (Accelrys). The interaction parameters aij are calculated according to eq 2 and illustrated in Table 1. The diagonal elements used by Groot and
Rabone are chosen such that a bead fluid has the compressibility of
water.49 A cubic simulation box with periodic
boundary condition was applied in all directions. A box of 30 ×
30 × 30 rc3 is enough
to avoid the finite size effects, and the integration time step of
0.05 was small enough for our system to get thermodynamic equilibrium.
The simulation steps of 200,000 were used. All simulations were carried
out using the DPD method in Mesocite module of the commercial software
package Materials Studio.

It is known that amphiphilic polymers self-assemble
to form micelles
in aqueous solution when the concentration is higher than its critical
micelle concentration. Several morphologies of micelles consist of
a polymer, water, and DMF with different volume ratios. All beads
distributed randomly at the beginning of the simulation aggregate
to form small clusters first and then turn into larger aggregates,
depending on the water-to-DMF ratio. At 5 and 10% volumes of the G2-PEG
dendrimer in the absence of Nile red, the dendrimer beads tend to
aggregate to form spherical micelles at the low volume ratios of DMF
(Figure 4b). The hydrophobic
centers of the dendrimer are distributed inside the micelle-forming
hydrophobic core, and hydrophilic PEG spreads around the surface,
forming a protective shell. As the DMF-to-water ratio increases, the
spherical aggregates change to ring- and sheet-like structures. No
specific morphologies were formed at the volume ratio of DMF >
water.
From the DPD simulation results in the absence of Nile red, we found
that the dendrimer aggregates to stable spherical micelles at the
volume ratio of water/DMF > 9.

The similar morphological
developments of the dendrimer were observed
in the DPD simulations in the presence of 1% Nile red (Figure 4b(ix)–(xii)). When the
volume ratio of dendrimer/water/DMF/Nile red is 5.0:86.0:8.0:1.0,
spherical micelles with a stable structure with PEG shell are formed
at the early period of simulation with less than 20,000 steps. Extra
simulation steps to 200,000 gave no significant changes in the aggregate
morphology. This is in good agreement with the experimental results
(see TEM image in Figure 5a). The Nile red beads gradually diffuse
into the micelles and finally are distributed in the core of micelle
formed by the dendrimer beads (see the cross-sectional view in Figure 4b(ix)), indicating
that the micelle formed by the dendrimer is a reasonable carrier for
a hydrophobic drug such as Nile red. Due to the increase in dendrimer
content from 5 to 10% at the similar DMF-to-water ratio, the stable
spherical micelles collapse to smaller micelles. The increase of the
relative amount of DMF yields a fibril shape. It is interesting to
note that no specific configurations of aggregates are observed and
that the Nile red beads are not stably distributed inside of aggregates
when DMF is a primary solvent (see the morphology obtained at P/W/D/N
= 5.0:8.0:88.0:1.0).

and (b)
Nile red release in the presence of 0.0, 0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 mM H2O2 in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution.

For dye encapsulation and release studies, 1 mg
of Nile red solution
in DMF was added to 0.5 wt % G2-PEG in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer solution
and DMF mixture in 9:1 (v/v) ratio and stirred at 80 °C for 2
h. After slowly cooling the solution temperature to room temperature,
the Nile red encapsulation in dendrimer was studied by UV–visible
spectroscopy. The drug loading capacity of the micelles was determined
as 12%, and the drug loading efficiency was 41% by UV–visible
spectroscopy. The size and shape of the self-assembled morphology
were similar to those self-assembled in the absence of Nile red (Figure 5a). The Nile red
molecules are surrounded by the hydrophobic block located in the core
of the micelles, which might lead to improved hydrophobic Nile red
encapsulation capacity and efficiency via inter- and intramolecular
hydrophobic interactions.

A H2O2-triggered
dye release by the disintegration
of micelles is studied by fluorescence spectroscopy, and the Nile
red encapsulated micellar solution is treated with different concentrations
(0–10 mM) of H2O2 solution. The controlled
experiment performed without adding H2O2 showed
a constant Nile red intensity, whereas a decrease in Nile red fluorescence
intensity was observed in the presence of H2O2 as an indication for dye release with the disintegration of micelles
(Figure 5b). At 10
mM H2O2, a faster decrease in Nile red intensity
was observed compared to 1 mM and 0.1 mM H2O2 due to faster degradation of micelles. About 58% decrease in Nile
red intensity was observed in 2 h at 10 mM H2O2, while 28 and 10% decreases were recorded at 1 and 0.1 mM, respectively,
at same time scale. In 24 h, the Nile red release reached 80% for
both 10 and 1 mM H2O2, whereas for 0.1 mM, the
release reached only 40%. The experimental data show a slow degradation
of micelles in the presence of H2O2 (24 h) compared
to the disintegration of micelles by UV irradiation (60 min).

Conclusions
In conclusion, we designed and prepared a stimuli-responsive heterofunctional
degradable G2-PEG dendrimer in straightforward steps utilizing a series
of P-MCR and click chemistry. The degradability of the resulting amphiphilic
dendrimer can be tuned by H2O2 concentration
and UV irradiation time. A fast degradation was observed under UV
light irradiation, whereas slow degradation was observed in the presence
of H2O2. Since the degradation kinetics can
be controlled by UV irradiation and oxidation condition, the dendrimer
can be a good encapsulant for the controlled release of encapsulate.

Synthesis
of G2-PEG by Click Reaction
In a Schlenk
tube, G2 alkyne (0.5 g, 0.16 mmol) and MPEG-azide (0.99 g, 1.59 mmol)
were dissolved in DMF. The solution was purged with nitrogen for 30
min. In another vial TBTA (0.0085 g, 0.016 mmol) was dissolved in
1 mL of DMF and purged with nitrogen for 15 min; then, Cu(I)I (0.003
g, 0.016 mmol) was added and further purged for additional 10 min.
This catalytic solution was added to the above reaction mixture and
stirred for 18 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched by
precipitation in diethyl ether. The crude product was passed through
a short plug of silica using 10% methanol in dichloromethane as an
eluent to get pure G2-PEG as a colorless viscous liquid. Yield = 0.8
g (62%).
