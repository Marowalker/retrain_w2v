Endotoxin
is a highly toxic stimulator originated from the outer
membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which should be monitored sensitively
and selectively for human health concerns. Traditional detection methods
mainly rely on limulus amoebocyte lysate assay. However, it suffers
drawbacks like the narrow detection range, and the results may be
environment-dependent. In this work, we have developed a sensitive
electrochemical biosensor for endotoxin assay. Peptide is first designed
as specific recognition element toward endotoxin. Graphene oxide and
DNA-modified gold nanoparticles are then used to enhance the electrochemical
signal. The analytical performances are excellent with the limit of
detection as low as 0.001 EU mL–1. This method has
also been successfully applied in endotoxin assay in complex biological
samples, which may have great potential use.

==== Body
Introduction
Endotoxin is the main ingredient of the
outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria.1 It acts as an extremely strong
stimulator of innate immunity. Although it is beneficial at low concentrations,
higher levels of endotoxin may cause symptoms like diarrhea, fever,
multi organism failure, septic shock, and even death.2 Exposure to endotoxin may occur through injection, dialysis,
and polluted drinking water.3−5 For example, dialysis patients
are typically exposed to an annual 20 000 to 30 000
L of dialysis fluid, and the opportunity to experience an inflammation
due to endotoxin contamination is significantly increased.6 Considering the health risks of endotoxin, sensitive
and convenient methods for endotoxin assay is critical and have attracted
much attention.7,8

Although there have been
well-established methods for the determination
of endotoxin like the limulus amoebocyte lysate (LAL) assay as the
golden method, many drawbacks should be overcome.9 For instance, the linear range of LAL assay is narrow and
the detection result is highly pH and temperature dependent. The detection
of endotoxin can also be interfered by beta-glucan. Therefore, the
development of enzyme-free assays should be emphasized. Different
affinity molecules have been explored including aptamer,10 peptide,11 protein,12 polymycin B,13 and
so on. In addition, many nanomaterials have also been employed for
the generation and amplification of obtained signals.14,15 For example, An and Jang immobilized a specific aptamer on glass
for optical sensing and separation of endotoxin.16 Lim et al. employed peptide-assembled graphene oxide in
a fluorescent sensing system for sensitive detection of endotoxin.17 Brosel-Oliu et al. fabricated a label-free impedimetric
sensor for endotoxin assay based on concanavalin A recognition.18 However, because of the increasing demands for
endotoxin assay, there still exists an urgent need for more convenient,
sensitive, and reliable methods for the practical detection of endotoxin.

In this work, we have integrated peptide-assembled graphene oxide
and DNA modified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in an electrochemical
sensing system for endotoxin assay. The thiol group of the peptide
is able to bind to gold, localizing AuNPs on the electrode surface.
The labeled ferrocene (Fc) molecules offer intense electrochemical
responses. However, in the presence of endotoxin, specific interaction
between endotoxin and peptide releases the thiol-containing peptide
away from the electrode and the recorded signal of Fc is decreased.
This novel method achieves a wide linear range from 0.005 to 1 EU
mL–1 with a quite low limit of detection (LOD) of
0.001 EU mL–1.

Results and Discussion
Detailed sensing principle is illustrated in Scheme 1. Generally, a glassy carbon electrode is
first modified with negatively charged graphene oxide. The positively
charged endotoxin binding peptide (pI = 2) is able to be absorbed
on the electrode via electrostatic interactions. The specific recognition
overcomes the potential interference like beta-glucan, nanoparticles,
and so on. The thiol group of cysteine at the C-terminal of the peptide
allows the attachment of AuNPs on the electrode surface via gold–sulfur
chemistry. Because Fc-labeled DNA probe is previously modified on
the surface of AuNPs, significant Fc response could be recorded. Nevertheless,
the peptide can be released from the graphene oxide by interacting
with target endotoxin, negatively charged AuNPs cannot be facilely
localized on the electrode, and the electrochemical signal is reduced.
By analyzing the peak current of the electrochemical system, the initial
endotoxin level can be evaluated. The proposed method has several
merits including high selectivity and high sensitivity. The applied
peptide not only allows specific recognition but also helps recruit
numerous electrochemical species. The high sensitivity is attributed
to two aspects. First, the good electric-conductivity of graphene
oxide and AuNPs promise the electrochemical response with high intensity;
second, because of the large specific area of AuNPs, a huge number
of DNA molecules which are labeled with Fc are loaded on each AuNP,
which assist the improvement of the sensitivity.19

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Electrochemical Biosensor for
the Detection of
Endotoxin
The adsorption of AuNPs on
graphene oxide can be intuitively determined
by transmission electron microscopic (TEM) images. Sphere AuNPs can
be observed with the diameter about 13 nm (Figure 1A). Without the assembled peptide, nearly
no AuNPs can be decorated on the surface of graphene oxide because
of electrostatic repulsion (Figure 1B). On the contrary, the added peptide provides abundant
thiols for specific gold–sulfur interaction and a large number
of AuNPs can thus be located on the graphene oxide nanosheets (Figure 1C). These results
demonstrate that the peptide in this work not only functions as the
recognition element but also helps the localization of AuNPs with
electrochemical species.

Figure 1 TEM images of (A) bare AuNPs, graphene oxide
mixed with AuNPs in
the (B) absence and (C) presence of peptide.

We have further studied the effect of endotoxin on the electrochemical
system. As depicted in Figure 2, the square wave voltammetry (SWV) curves of graphene oxide
modified electrode before and after the assembly of peptide show no
current peaks of Fc. After the capture of AuNPs, a strong peak is
observed. However, if endotoxin exists in the sensing system, the
disassociation of the peptide makes the immobilization of AuNPs impossible
and the Fc signal disappears. The SWV responses demonstrate the feasibility
of the system for endotoxin assay.

electrode, (b) peptide
modified electrode, after incubation with DNA modified AuNPs in the
(c) absence and (d) presence of endotoxin. Modulation amplitude: 25
mV, the frequency: 70 Hz, step potential: 4 mV.

To achieve the best analytical performances, we have optimized
the reaction times. Longer incubation of AuNPs with the electrode
and longer incubation time of endotoxin with the peptide contributes
to more adequate localization of Fc and release of the peptide. Also,
the peak currents reach saturation after 90 and 10 min, respectively
(Figure 3). Therefore,
we have chosen the reaction times in the following quantitative experiments.
As shown in Figure 4a, with larger amount of endotoxin, the SWV peak intends to be decreased.
Detailed relationship between the variation of peak current and the
endotoxin concentration is summarized in Figure 4b. A linear range is found to be 0.005 to 1 EU mL–1 with the equation of y = 22.04 +
8.71x, in which x is the logarithmic
endotoxin concentration and y is the decreased SWV
peak current. LOD is calculated as low as 0.001 EU mL–1 based on 3 standard deviation (SD)/slope of calibration. The average
relative SD is less than 10%, which is satisfactory. The analytical
performances of this method are also excellent after compared with
some representative reports (Table 1).

The selectivity of this assay is then evaluated by

The results shown in Table 2 imply that after employing bovine serum albumin (BSA), ligase,
phi29 DNA polymerase, glucose, random peptide, immunoglobulin G (IgG),
glutathione (GSH), some cations, and AuNPs, the electrochemical responses
are similar with the blank case. After being spiked with a certain
amount of endotoxin, the peak decreases significantly, demonstrating
the specific interaction between the released peptide and target endotoxin.
To test the practical utility of this method, we have further spiked
standard endotoxin into Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM)
and serum samples. The detected values are listed in Table 3, which indicate that the complicated
samples do not interfere accurate detection of endotoxin. The recoveries
are from 94.0 to 110.0% and all relative errors are no larger than
5%.

Conclusions
In summary, we have fabricated a sensitive
and selective electrochemical
method for endotoxin assay combining peptide-modified graphene oxide
and DNA-modified AuNPs. Because of excellent electric-conductivity
of graphene oxide and AuNPs, significant electrochemical response
can be obtained. The specificity of this method relies on the peptide-based
recognition. The method achieves high sensitivity and it can be practically
utilized for endotoxin assay in complicated biological samples, which
has potential use for endotoxin monitoring in near future.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instruments
Endotoxin was obtained from
Chinese Horseshoe Crab Reagent Manufactory (Xiamen) Co., Ltd. (China).
BSA, glucose, GSH, gold(III) chloride trihydrate (HAuCl4·3H2O), tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride,
and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(USA). Ligase and phi29 DNA polymerase were from New England Biolabs
Ltd. (Beijing, China). IgG was purchased from Sino Biological Inc.
(China). DMEM was purchased from Gibco (Gaithersburg, USA). Graphene
oxide was purchased from Nanjing XF-NANO Materials Tech. Co., Ltd.
(Nanjing, China). The specific endotoxin binding peptide with the
sequence of KKNYSSSISSIHC and random peptide (QPVEISRGDH) were synthesized
and purified by China Peptides Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The endotoxin
binding peptide was chosen according to a previous report, in which
Suzuki et al. selected the peptide using the phage-display method.28 The oligonucleotide was synthesized and purified
by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The specific sequence
was 5′-ferrocene-TCCATGTACCTT-3′ SH. Human serum samples
were obtained from local hospital (Suzhou, China). The other chemicals
or reagents were of analytical grade as received.

Preparation
of DNA Modified AuNPs
Bare AuNPs were synthesized
by means of citrate reduction of HAuCl4 according to a
previous report.29 First, 100 mL of HAuCl4 solution (0.01%, w/v) and 3.5 mL of trisodium citrate solution
(1%, w/v) were prepared. Second, trisodium citrate was added to HAuCl4 refluxing solution under stirring and boiling for 15 min.
Third, the mixture was stirred for another 30 min before cooled down
to room temperature. Next, 30 μM DNA probe was prepared in 10
mM phosphate buffer with 0.25 M NaCl (pH 7.4). DNA was then blended
with AuNPs with the ratio of 1:9. After 1 min, the solution was adjusted
to pH 3.0 using citrate buffer. Excess reagents were then removed
by centrifuging at 12 000 rpm for 30 min. After that, the precipitate
was redispersed.

Preparation of Peptide-Modified Electrode
The substrate
glassy carbon electrode (3 mm) was pretreated with piranha solution
(98% H2SO4/30% H2O2 =
3:1) for about 5 min (Caution: highly corrosive). Next, the electrode
was carefully rinsed and polished on P5000 silicon carbide paper to
a mirror-like surface. After sonicated in ethanol and distilled water,
respectively, the electrode was incubated with 10 μL of graphene
oxide (500 mg L–1) and then dried overnight at room
temperature. The modified electrode was further treated with 2 μM
peptide for 15 min in order to achieve the assembly of the peptide
on the electrode surface.

Quantification of Endotoxin
Standard
endotoxin with
a series of concentrations was prepared and the peptide modified electrode
was immersed in the solution for 10 min. Subsequently, the electrode
was rinsed and then incubated with DNA-modified AuNPs for 90 min.

Electrochemical Measurement
We applied an electrochemical
analyzer (CHI660D, CH Instruments) for all electrochemical experiments.
A three-electrode system was employed, which was consisted of the
peptide-modified electrode as the working electrode, a platinum auxiliary
electrode, and a saturated calomel reference electrode. SWV was carried
out in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 140 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2.
