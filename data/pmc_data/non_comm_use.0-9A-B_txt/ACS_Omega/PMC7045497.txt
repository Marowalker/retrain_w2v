The highly efficient removal of tetracycline
(TC) from an aqueous
solution was accomplished by using the raw shrimp shell waste (SSW)
as an environmentally friendly adsorbent. The SSW without any treatment
removed TC more efficiently than the SSW after being treated with
HCl and NaOH solutions. The SSW was characterized using nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms, scanning electron microscopy alongside energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, a thermogravimetric-derivative
thermogravimetry analyzer, and a ζ-potential analyzer. The maximum
adsorption capacity of 400 mg/L SSW was 229.98 mg/g for 36 h at 55
°C. Both the Langmuir isotherm model and the pseudo-second-order
kinetic model well described the experimental data. According to the
values of the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy changes, the TC adsorption
by SSW proved to be spontaneous and endothermic. The TC adsorption
process was controlled by intraparticle diffusion and liquid film
diffusion.

1 Introduction
Tetracycline
(TC) is a common, low-cost antibiotic with broad-spectrum
antimicrobial activity and is therefore widely used for treating infections
in both human and veterinary medicine.1 It has been reported that TC cannot be completely metabolized in
the bodies of humans or animals with around 90% of the consumed TC
being released into the environment’s water and soil through
urine.2 The discharge of TC into the natural
environment not only increases the probability of triggering antimicrobial
resistance but also expands the risk of transmitting antimicrobial-resistant
bacteria through the food chain. In 2009, TC was detected in urban
rivers of Shanghai, China with maximum concentrations of 113.89 ng/L,
which is slightly higher than that of the urban rivers of eastern
Australia.3,4 Thus, it is necessary to develop a cost-effective
TC removal method for the treatment of wastewater.

Several TC
removal methods have been extensively studied, including
advanced oxidation,5 adsorption,6 and biological treatment.7 Among these methods, the adsorption method is the most attractive
due to features such as high efficiency, low cost, environmental nontoxicity,
and simple operation requirements for the treatment process.8,9 Several adsorbents have been employed to remove TC from wastewater,
such as activated carbons,11,12 silicon materials,10 and polymers.13 However,
the large-scale applications of the adsorbents listed above are restricted
due to complex preparation requirements and high cost.

Currently,
shell waste produced by the seafood industry is a growing
problem with significant environmental and health hazards. Unlike
fish, less than 40 wt % of crustaceans are edible, resulting in a
large amount of crab, shrimp, and lobster shells being discarded and
dumped in landfills. Shrimp is a typical class of the marine crustacean,
and 5.16 million tonnes were produced in 2016 in China, with the amount
continuing to increase over recent years.14 Considering SSW accounts for 40–66% of the shrimp body by
weight, the annual production of SSW is over 2.6 million tonnes.15 The main components of SSW are chitin protein
and calcium carbonate,15 and the uses of
SSW as an adsorbent for dyes, such as Congo red15 and acid blue,16 and toxic elements,
such as arsenic,17 uranium,18 and fluorine19 had
been reported. As an adsorbent, SSW has shown several advantages,
such as low cost, simple preparation, and favorable adsorption capacity,
amongst others.20,21 As far as we know, there are
no published works investigating the potential for adsorption of tetracycline
using SSW. This study focused on the application of SSW as an adsorbent
for removing TC from aqueous solutions. The surface areas, porosities,
and chemical surface groups of the SSW adsorbent were analyzed. Its
adsorption performance was extensively tested by varying different
experimental conditions, including the pH value, the initial TC concentration,
and the contact time. The adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and mechanism
of the adsorption process were investigated in detail.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Adsorbent
2.1.1 Chemical Composition and Surface Morphology
The morphologies
of SSW before TC adsorption were characterized
by SEM images. Furthermore, the compositions and distributions of
various major elements in SSW were identified with EDX mapping. As
seen in Figure 1, the
surface of SSW was rough and some elliptic cylinder channels were
dispersed on the surfaces. As seen in Figure 2 and Table S1,
the EDX analysis indicated that SSW consisted mainly of the elements
C, N, O, Ca, and P. The mass ratio of Ca to P in SSW was 1.69, which
is similar to 1.67, the mass ratio of Ca to P in the hydroxyapatite
(Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2), suggesting
that SSW contains the hydroxyapatite. After the TC adsorption, the
mass ratio of Ca to P was determined to be 1.70, nearly identical
to that of the SSW before adsorption, demonstrating that negligible
hydroxyapatite leaching occurred during the adsorption at a pH value
of 7 for the TC solution.22 The EDX results
also showed that the N content after the adsorption was considerably
higher than that before the adsorption. Considering that the element
of N was only present in TC, it can be inferred that a large amount
of TC was adsorbed by SSW.

Figure 2 EDX elemental mapping images of SSW.

The pore textural properties of SSW adsorbents are displayed in Figure 3. The N2 adsorption–desorption profile of SSW was assigned as a type
IV isotherm, which was characteristic of mesoporous material. On the
basis of the IUPAC classification, the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
profile curve of SSW was assigned as a type IV isotherm with a type
H4 hysteresis loop, indicating the existence of mesopores in the SSW.
These characteristics proved that SSW was a mesoporous material with
an SBET of 8.90 m2/g and an
average pore diameter of 4.47 nm. Since the maximum diameter of TC
is 12.7 Å, the TC molecules were able to pass through the pores
of the SSW structure.23

and desorption isotherms at 77 K and
(b) pore size distribution of SSW.

2.1.2 FT-IR Analysis
The FT-IR spectra
of the SSW before and after the adsorption of TC are shown in Figure 4. The wide peak at
3437 cm–1 was ascribed to the mixed stretching vibrations
of many O–H groups in the chitin of SSW.24,25 The peaks at 1653, 1556, 1241, and 1030 cm–1 were
ascribed to the stretching vibration of C=O groups in amide
I,24 the bending vibration of N–H
groups in amide II,24,26 the stretching vibration of C–N
in amide III,22 and the P–O antisymmetric
stretching vibration in the phosphates of SSW,15,26 respectively. There were two characteristic C–O vibration
peaks for the carbonate, and the peaks were around 1417 and 872 cm–1, respectively.22,26,27 The presence of amide I, amide II, and amide III illustrated that
the SSW contained collagen,22 while the
presence of phosphate and carbonate indicated that hydroxylapatite
or carbonate apatite was contained in SSW. However, a few peaks underwent
notable changes after TC adsorption. The characteristic peak of amide
I shifted from 1653 to 1626 cm–1, while the characteristic
peak of amide II moved from 1558 to 1503 cm–1, and
both peak strengths increased significantly. It was determined that
the secondary structure of the collagen changed after the adsorption,
suggesting that a portion of the collagen in SSW interacted with the
TC. In addition, the peak at 3437 cm–1 changed to
3424 cm–1, showing that the hydroxyl group was involved
in the adsorption reaction, which resulted in the formation of hydrogen
bonds between SSW and TC. The intensity of the peaks at 1417 and 872
cm–1 decreased after the TC adsorption, demonstrating
that interactions between carbonate and TC molecules occurred during
the adsorption as well. Moreover, the peaks at 1450 and 697 cm–1 were attributed to the stretching vibration of the
C=C bond in the aromatic skeletal24,26 and the out-of-plane bending vibration of C–H groups in the
aromatic ring of TC,26,28 respectively. These characteristic
peaks also appeared on the curves of the SSW after TC adsorption,
showing that TC was successfully physically adsorbed onto SSW.

of SSW before and after the adsorption of TC and
TC molecule.

2.1.3 TGA
Analysis
As shown in Figure 5, TGA was conducted
to investigate the composition of SSW. An initial weight loss of 10%
occurred in the temperature range of 90–260 °C, which
was caused by the evaporation of water.29 A more substantial weight loss of around 36% was observed in the
temperature range of 260–480 °C, which resulted from the
decomposition of collagen.30 The third
weight loss of 13% occurred between 480 and 710 °C, which is
likely related to the formation of conjugated molecules by the elimination
of water and other components of the chitin molecule.31 The final weight loss between 710 and 830 °C was approximately
14% and was assigned to the release of volatile compounds from SSW.30

2.1.4 Fluorescence Spectroscopy
The reaction
between the carbonates and TC was verified by fluorescence measurements.
The fluorescence emission spectra of TC, the SSW adsorbents after
treatment using NaOH solution, and the adsorption products of TC by
the NaOH-treated SSW are shown in Figure 6. The aim of the treatment with NaOH solution
was to remove the protein in SSW, and thus the major component contained
in the residual SSW was the calcium carbonate (CaCO3).
As shown in Figure 6, the characteristic peak of TC and the residual SSW was around 560
and 480 nm, respectively. However, the characteristic peak for the
adsorption products of the residual SSW moved to 535 nm and its fluorescence
intensity became higher significantly. This was because the calcium
carbonate in the SSW formed a complex with TC, indicating that TC
interacted with the SSW adsorbent during the adsorption process.

treatment using NaOH solution, and the adsorption products of TC by

2.1.5 ζ-Potential
of SSW at Different pH
Values
Figure 7 presents the ζ potential of SSW in aqueous solutions with
different pH values. The pH value at which the SSW surface has a net
neutral charge is referred to as the pH value at the point of zero
charges (pHpzc). The pHpzc value of SSW was
determined to be 7.35. It was noted that the surface of SSW was positively
charged when the pH value was lower than 7.35 and the surface of SSW
was negatively charged when the pH value was higher than 7.35.

2.2 TC Adsorption Performance
2.2.1 Pretreatment of SSW
It was reported
in some previous researches that pretreatment using acid or alkali
was able to improve the adsorption capacity of some solid wastes,
such as sawdust,12 cassava,32 and crab shell.33 The effect of the pretreatment time using either HCl solution or
NaOH solution on the adsorption capacity of SSW was investigated.
As illustrated in Figure S1, the TC adsorption
capacity of SSW lowered gradually with the increase of the pretreatment
time. This was due to the HCl and NaOH solutions’ continuous
consumption of certain components of SSW, resulting in the collapse
of some pores in the SSW particles. It is shown in Figures 4 and 6 that both proteins and carbonates, both components of SSW, were
capable of reacting with TC. However, if an excessive amount of the
carbonates and proteins were consumed by HCl or NaOH solutions during
a lengthy pretreatment, the adsorption capacity of SSW would be severely
reduced. Consequently, SSW that did not undergo any pretreatment with
HCl or NaOH solutions was utilized as the adsorbent for TC. Table S2 gives a comparison of the prepared adsorbent
with some other adsorbents using some wastes as the raw materials,
such as spent coffee wastes,34 cow manure,6 and human hair.23 It
was displayed that the performance of the SSW adsorbent was favorable
in this comparison.

2.2.2 Effect of the Initial
pH Value
Figure S2 demonstrates
the effects of
the initial pH value of the TC aqueous solutions on the adsorption
capacity of SSW. As the initial pH value increased from 2 to 12, the
adsorption capacity of the adsorbents first increased and then decreased,
which agreed well with results from previous studies.12,34 At various pH values, TC could exist in the form of different species
in solution because of its classification as an amphoteric molecule
with many ionizable functional groups.35 As shown in Figure S3, the TC molecule
was hydrophilic and existed as TC+ when the pH value was
lower than 3.3, TC0, when the pH value was within the range
of 3.3–7.7, TC–, when the pH value was between
7.7 and 9.7, and TC2–, when the pH value was higher
than 9.7.36,37 As shown in Figure S7, the surfaces of the SSW particles were positively charged at pH
values below 7.35. Therefore, a strong electrostatic repulsion between
TC+ and SSW inhibited the adsorption of TC when the pH
value was lower than 3.3. In this case, both the hydrogen bonds and
the π bonds formed between TC and SSW were the two major forces
during adsorption at low pH values.12,38 When the pH
value rose above 3.3, the adsorption capacity was boosted, with the
highest value of 161.68 mg/g observed at a pH value of 7.0. During
the growth of the pH value from 3.3 to 7.0, the dominant ions of TC
in the solution changed from TC+ to TC0, while
there were scarcely any positively charged or negatively charged ions
on the SSW surface. Thus, the electrostatic repulsion was the lowest
in this range and it was favorable for TC to adsorb onto SSW, resulting
in the highest adsorption capacity when the pH value was 7.0. When
the pH value continued to increase beyond 7.0, the dominant ions converted
into TC– and TC2– and the SSW
surface became negatively charged. Consequently, a strong electrostatic
repulsion reappeared, and the adsorption of TC by SSW was prevented.
Therefore, the following adsorption experiments were performed at
pH = 7.0.

2.3 Adsorption Kinetics
The adsorption
kinetics describe the effects of contact time and adsorption temperature
on the TC adsorption rate. Kinetic studies were carried out by adding
0.01 g of adsorbent into 25 mL of TC solution with a concentration
of 100 mg/L at different temperatures from 25 to 55 °C. In addition,
three frequently used kinetic models, including pseudo-first-order,
pseudo-second-order, and the Elovich model, were utilized to fit the
adsorption data. The kinetic models are listed in Table S3, the related nonlinear curves are displayed in Figure 8, and the kinetic
parameters are calculated and shown in Table 1.

model of TC onto SSW (adsorbent dosage = 0.4 g/L, initial TC concentration
= 100 mg/L, pH = 7, time = 36 h).

 	R2	0.9639	0.9801	0.9862	0.9892	
For both the pseudo-first-order and the Elovich models,
the values R2 were notably lower than
1, while the values
Δqe were higher than zero. It was
concluded that both models were unable to fit the experimental data
well. Nevertheless, the pseudo-second-order kinetic model displayed
a high value of R2 (0.9985–0.9987)
and a low value of Δqe (1.05–3.96%).
The value qe,cal was calculated according
to the pseudo-second-order model and was very close to qe,exp, implying that the pseudo-second-order kinetic model
fit well with the adsorption data. In fact, the pseudo-second-order
model is typically used to describe chemisorption processes rather
than physisorption. Therefore, the exchange of electrons or valency
between the TC and SSW adsorbent during the adsorption process was
not negligible.39,40

The adsorption of TC onto
SSW was also analyzed by the two-compartment
first-order model, which regarded the adsorption as a two-domain process.
As listed in Table 1, the values R2 were high (0.9991–0.9995)
and the values Δqe were low (0.95–1.56%),
indicating that the two-compartment model agreed well with the experimental
data. The values of ffast and kfast were larger than fslow and kslow, respectively. The
ratio of ffast to fslow was higher than 1, suggesting that the fast adsorption
stage played a predominant role in the overall adsorption process.
It is commonly accepted that the hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl
groups in TC molecules and the oxygen-containing groups on the SSW
surface, as well as the π–π electron-donor–acceptor
interactions, were responsible for the fast sorption of TC.12

2.4 Adsorption Isotherm
Adsorption isotherms
were used to reveal the relationship between the adsorption capacity
of SSW and the TC concentration in the residual solutions at adsorption
equilibrium. Three adsorption isotherms, including the Langmuir, Freundlich,
and Temkin isotherm models, were used to fit the experimental data
when the adsorption equilibrium was reached. The isotherm models are
listed in Table S3. To identify the model
that best describes the adsorption isotherms and the adsorption curves,
both the determination coefficient, R2, and the normalized standard deviation, Δqe, of every model were calculated and used as bases for
comparison. R2 and Δqe were calculated as shown in eqs 1 and 2. 1   2  where qe,exp and qe,cal are the experimental
adsorption capacity
(mg/g) and the calculated adsorption capacity (mg/g), respectively,
and N is the number of experimental data points.

In the fitting process, the initial TC concentration ranged from
0 to 800 mg/g while the adsorption temperature was varied between
25 and 55 °C. Plots of the nonlinear fittings corresponding to
the above three isotherms were drawn in Figure 9, and the related parameter values are listed
in Table 2. For the
Freundlich isotherms, R2 values were in
the range of 0.9306–0.9636 and the values Δqe were in the range of 5.07–37.52%. Since the values R2 were consistently lower than 1, and the values
Δqe were higher than zero, the Freundlich
isotherm proved difficult in describing the TC adsorption behavior.

The Langmuir isotherms
depict adsorption occurring on a homogeneous
surface with adsorbates dispersed in monolayers on the surfaces of
the adsorbents.41 The values R2 were in the range of 0.9914–0.9996, while the
values Δqe were in the range of
1.30–6.96%. This indicated that the Langmuir isotherm was capable
of describing the adsorption behavior. In the Langmuir isotherm, KL is an important evaluation parameter related
to the affinity of the binding sites. If the range KL is between 0–1 and increases with increasing
temperature, adsorption of TC onto the SSW adsorbent is deemed favorable,
especially at high temperatures. As observed in Table 2, KL increased
from 0.0209 to 0.1726 with an increase in temperature. The results
showed that SSW had a high capacity for TC adsorption, especially
at high temperatures.9

The Temkin
model illustrates that the heat of adsorption is inversely
proportional to the surface area covered by the adsorbate molecules,
which is due to adsorbent–adsorbate interactions.42BT is Temkin constant
related to the heat of adsorption, where a positive value of BT indicates an endothermic adsorption process.
The values BT were between 35.1690 and
57.7383 J/mol for TC adsorption from the aqueous solution, which indicated
that the adsorption of TC by SSW was endothermic.43 The equilibrium binding constant AT is a parameter that corresponds to the maximum binding energy.
The values of AT increase with increasing
temperature, indicating the adsorption process is endothermic. With
the increase of the adsorption temperature from 25 to 55 °C,
the values of AT increased from 0.3105
to 16.7206 L/mg, indicating that the adsorption of TC by SSW was endothermic.

In the adsorption process, the standard
Gibbs free-energy change
ΔG0, the standard molar adsorption
enthalpy ΔH0, and the standard entropy
change ΔS0 were calculated according
to the Van’t Hoff equation shown by eqs 3 and 4. Their results
are available in Table 3. 3   4  where R is the gas constant
equaling 8.314 J/(mol·K), T is the adsorption
temperature (K), K is the equilibrium constant of
adsorption (L/mol),44−47KL is the equilibrium constant in the
Langmuir equation (L/mg), and MCO2 is the molecular weight of CO2 (g/mol).

The
absolute values of ΔG0 increased
as the adsorption temperature rose, showing that the adsorption was
favorable at high temperatures.48 Furthermore,
ΔH0 was 54.80 kJ/mol, and the positive
value indicated an endothermic characteristic of the adsorption process.
ΔS0 was calculated to be 258.47
J/(mol·K), where the resulting positive value revealed an increase
in the degree of randomness at the solid–liquid interface during
the adsorption.49 Similar results have
also been reported in the adsorption of amoxicillin by guava seeds.50

2.5 Adsorption Mechanisms
Both the intraparticle
diffusion model and the liquid film diffusion model were employed
to determine the mechanism and rate-limiting steps of the TC adsorption.
During this process, the transfer of TC molecules was affected by
either the liquid film diffusion, or the intraparticle diffusion,
or a combination of both. Figure 10 depicts the multilinear plots qt verses t1/2 at
adsorption temperatures of 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C. Table 1 lists the values of the parameters
required for the intraparticle diffusion model, including kpi, Ci, and R2. The intraparticle diffusion constant, kpi, corresponds to the slope of the straight
line, and Ci is related to the boundary
layer thickness.42 As shown in Figure 10, each adsorption
process carried out at the various temperatures is divided into three
periods based on the three sequential straight lines resulting from
the successful fitting of adsorption models to the data. The first
stage describes the region where the adsorption is liquid film diffusion-controlled
as the TC molecules transfer from the solution to the surface of the
SSW. The adsorption in this stage proceeded more quickly than in the
other two stages. The fittings plotted in the first stage for adsorption
temperatures of 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C, did not pass through the
coordinate origin, indicating that intraparticle diffusion was not
the only rate-limiting step in the adsorption process.9 During the second slower stage, TC molecules were transported
into the pores of the SSW particles, resulting in an intraparticle
diffusion rate-limiting step. The third and final step was the slowest
due to the low TC concentration in the remaining solution, and it
was assumed to exist in approximate adsorption equilibrium. Both values kpi for the second and the third stages were
lower than that of the first stage, which was due to the slowing of
intraparticle diffusion as the concentration of TC in the solution
decreased.51,52 Additionally, the liquid film
diffusion model was also employed for determining the rate-limiting
step in the adsorption process. The model is presented in Table S3, and the corresponding plot of ln(1
– qt/qe) versus t is shown in Figure 6. It is proposed that the liquid
film diffusion is the rate-limiting step of the adsorption when the
plot of ln(1 – qt/qe) versus t shows
a straight line passing through the coordinate origin. In other situations,
such as when the plot is nonlinear or linear without passing through
the coordinate origin, the adsorption process is controlled by liquid
film diffusion or a combination of liquid film diffusion and intraparticle
diffusion. As observed in Figure 6, all plots of the data fitting were approximately
linear and none of them pass through the coordinate origin. So, the
liquid film diffusion was not just one of the rate-limiting steps
in the adsorption of TC by SSW. Thus, the rate-limiting steps of the
adsorption involved both intraparticle diffusion and liquid film diffusion.
Similar results were also obtained for the adsorption of TC by macadamia
nutshells.53

and (b) liquid film diffusion plots
for TC adsorption onto SSW at 25, 35, 45, and 55 °C (adsorbent
dosage = 0.4 g/L, initial TC concentration = 100 mg/L, pH = 7).

3 Conclusions
The
raw SSW without any pretreatment was proven to be a cost-effective
adsorbent for TC adsorption in aqueous solutions. The TC adsorption
performance of SSW was the best when the pH value of the solution
was in the range of 6.0–8.0. The maximum TC adsorption capacity
of 400 mg/L of the SSW in aqueous solutions was 229.98 mg/g for 36
h at 55 °C. For the adsorption, the Langmuir model fits best
with the adsorption isotherms data, while the pseudo-second-order
model best described the adsorption kinetics data. The values of the
Gibbs free-energy changes ranged from −1.50 to −6.66
kJ/mol, and the enthalpy change was determined to be 47.61 kJ/mol,
indicating that the adsorption of TC by SSW was spontaneous and endothermic.
Both the intraparticle diffusion and the liquid film diffusion were
identified as the rate-limiting steps in the TC adsorption.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Preparation of TC Solutions
TC (C22H25ClN2O8; purity,
90%)
was purchased from Aladdin Biochemical Co., Ltd., China. Hydrochloric
acid (HCl, purity, 36%) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH, purity, 99%) were
purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd, China. All reagents
used in this work were of analytical grade, and all were used as purchased
without further purification. One gram of TC was dissolved in 1 L
of deionized water to prepare the standard TC stock solution with
a TC mass concentration of 1000 mg/L and was then diluted to prepare
additional solutions with the required TC concentrations. The pH of
the TC solutions was adjusted to the required values using either
0.1 mol/L of NaOH or 0.1 mol/L of HCl.

4.2 Preparation
of Adsorbent
SSW were
collected from a local seafood processing plant in Qingdao, China.
First, they were repeatedly washed with deionized water to remove
dirt from the surface, then, the cleaned samples were dried in a drying
oven at 80 °C for 48 h. Some of the SSW samples were not treated
any further, while others underwent additional treatment steps using
an HCl solution, NaOH solution, or both solutions in sequence.

During treatment, the dried SSW were first added into the HCl solution
(3 wt %) under stirring at 25 °C for 2, 3, 6, and 12 h to remove
calcium carbonate. After being washed with deionized water repeatedly
until the pH stabilized at 7, the samples were added to the NaOH solution
(8 wt %) at 25 °C for 2, 3, and 4 h to remove protein. Next,
the samples were washed and dried. The dried samples were mechanically
ground in a grinder for 20 min and sieved to collect each of the different
samples with particle sizes between 150 and 250 μm. All of the
samples were then stored in a desiccator until required for the subsequent
experiments. To determine the optimal adsorbent for TC, differently
treated adsorbents were employed.

4.3 Adsorption
Experiments
The adsorption
experiments were carried out in a conical flask containing 25 mL of
TC solution. First, 0.01 g of SSW adsorbent was poured into the TC
solution and the conical flask was placed in a gas bath thermostatic
oscillator with an agitation speed of 120 rpm at 25 °C. The agitation
duration would last until the adsorption reached the equilibrium.
Then, the suspensions were filtered using a microporous membrane with
an average pore size of 0.45 μm to collect the supernatants.
The TC concentration of the supernatant was measured by a UV–vis
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-1800, Japan) with a maximum wavelength
of 357 nm. To determine the optimum adsorption conditions of SSW,
TC adsorption experiments were carried out by adjusting the initial
pH value from 2 to 12, the initial TC concentration from 25 to 800
mg/L, and the contact time from 0 to 48 h. The adsorption capacity
at a certain time, t, was referred to as qt (mg/g) and was calculated
using eq 5. 5  where C0 and Ct were the TC concentration
in the solution before adsorption and the TC concentration of the
suspensions when the adsorption proceeded at a certain time t (mg/L), respectively. qt is the adsorption capacity at t time (mg/g). V is the TC solution volume (L), and W is
the mass of SSW (g). When the reaction time is enough and the adsorption
reaches the equilibrium, Ct and qt equal
to Ce and qe, respectively. The TC removal efficiency was calculated using eq 6. 6  where C0 and Ct have the same definition
as those in eq 5.

4.4 Characterization of the Adsorbent
The structure and
morphology of the SSW adsorbents were determined
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL7500F, Japan). Energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy performed alongside SEM was used to estimate
the surface elemental composition of SSW adsorbents. The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms were tested at a temperature
of 77 K to obtain the surface characteristics of SSW using an automated
specific surface area and porosity analyzer (Micromeritics ASAP 2020).
The surface areas and the pore size distributions were determined
using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) method and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) method, respectively. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FT-IR, Bruker TENSOR-27, Germany) was employed to evaluate the surface
functional groups of SSW. The samples were scanned within the wavenumber
region of 4000–600 cm–1. Thermogravimetric-derivative
thermogravimetry analysis (TG-DTG, NETZSCH STA 409PC/PG, Germany)
was used to investigate the thermal stability of the SSW adsorbents
under a nitrogen atmosphere with a flow rate of 100 mL/min and a heating
rate of 10 K/min from room temperature to 1173 K. The fluorescence
properties of the samples were analyzed by fluorescence spectroscopy
(Hitachi F-7000, Japan), and ζ potential was measured using
an electroacoustic spectrometer (MALVERN NanoZS90, U.K.) with pH values
recorded between 2.0 and 12.0.
