Two
trimellitic anhydride-functionalized, thermally reduced graphenes
with different aspect ratios, Af, and
the same C/O ratio (8:1) were prepared and melt-mixed into poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET), and the mechanical properties of the resulting
nanocomposites were studied with a focus on plastic deformation behavior.
A slight increase in the G′ of the melt was
observed for the surface-modified low-Af graphene composites (Af = 20) below
the percolation threshold, whereas a significant enhancement in G′ was observed for higher-Af graphene composites (Af = 80)
at all graphene loadings, both below and above the percolation concentration.
Furthermore, the use of modified low-Af graphene caused an improvement both in Young’s modulus and
elongation at break of the resulting PET nanocomposites because of
enhancement of interfacial adhesion between filler and matrix which
resulted in the formation of a coupled network via covalent bonding
and the suppression both of strain-induced orientation and strain-induced
crystallization. By contrast, the use of modified higher-Af surface graphene in nanocomposites caused a drastic
improvement in Young’s modulus but lower elongation-at-break
than with the unmodified counterpart; the former effect is due to
the formation of denser coupled networks and stronger interfacial
adhesion as a result of graphene surface modification and the latter
is due to the added geometrical restriction in unentangling chains
from the PET matrix in the presence of higher-Af graphene. The preceding observations demonstrate the potential
impacts of tuning both surface chemistry and aspect ratio of graphene
in the fabrication of PET/graphene composites.

Introduction
The fabrication of
polymer nanocomposites via the inclusion of
nanoparticles into the polymeric matrix has become a standard practice
to improve the properties of the resulting composites compared with
those of the parent polymers. Two-dimensional (2D) disc-shaped nanoparticles
perform better than spherical nanoparticles in terms of improving
mechanical properties, gas-barrier properties, and dimensional stability
of the resulting nanocomposites.1,2 Modified clay3−15 and graphene16−26 are commonly relied on disc-shaped nanofillers. Graphene has attracted
considerable attention on account of its large modulus (25027,28–1000 GPa29), high electrical conductivity,19,21,23,26,30−33 and high thermal conductivity.34

Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is
a high-performing semicrystalline
thermoplastic with elevated glass transition temperature (Tg), mechanical properties, chemical resistance,
and moldability, making it a good candidate for commercial usage in
bottles, cartridge, textile fibers, and films.35,36 The processing for PET pellets typically involves extrusion as sheets,
after which tentering, post-Tg annealing,
and other processing techniques are carried out.36−41 Finally, depending on the application of interest, the processed
polymer may be postprocessed into the desired shape via automated
techniques such as cutting, coating, laminating, and molding.

The property enhancement of PET/graphene nanocomposites compared
to that of pristine PET has already been reported elsewhere in the
literature.21−25,34,42−46 For instance, it has been demonstrated that (1) graphene is more
effective than graphite at improving the electrical conductivity of
PET composites,21 (2) in situ polymerization
yields composites of higher conductivity than melt-blending,22 and (3) graphene inclusion causes enhancement
in the mechanical properties,23,24,43 gas-barrier properties,42,44, and thermal
conductivity of PET.34 These advantages
of PET/graphene nanocomposites mean that it has the potential for
usage in various applications, including, but not limited to, molded
structural parts, textiles, cartridges, and films with antistatic,
electromagnetic-shielding, gas-barrier, and/or heat-dissipation properties.
These materials find usage in clothing, vehicles, electrical devices,
and packaging materials. The drawback of classical PET/graphene nanocomposite
fabrication techniques is that usually one or more of the mechanical
properties (flexibility and elongation at break) are compromised as
more graphene is loaded into the nanocomposite samples. This severely
limits the potential of PET/graphene composites for commercial usage
because of concerns over industrial-scale fabrication and quality
assurance. Shim et al.45 were able to overcome
the aforementioned issue by chemically functionalizing graphene oxide
(GO) prior to preparing the PET-based nanocomposites, a compatibilization
step which helped ensure that all the major mechanical properties
were enhanced in the resulting nanocomposites (including elongation
at break). The problem with this approach is its reliance on solution-processing
rather than melt-blending for the fabrication of the composites to
avoid elevated temperatures which could end up thermally reducing
GO.47 The simplicity of melt-processing
makes it desirable in the industry as a fabrication method for such
composites, so it is useful to modify graphene while still using melt-blending
to prepare the nanocomposites.

Our previous study addressed
this problem, reporting on the functionalization
of graphene with trimellitic anhydride groups and its effect on melt-mixing
graphene with PET in composites.46 This
functionalized graphene, Modi-G1, dispersed in PET without a noticeable
change in dispersion levels compared to unmodified graphene, G1, but
still succeeded at creating a physically cross-linked system between
the polymer and graphene filler during the blending stage, producing
melt-mixed PET/graphene nanocomposites which were less brittle than
their unmodified graphene counterparts because of a combination of
stronger interface adhesion and the restriction of chain mobility
which occurs during deformation as a result of strain-induced orientation
and strain-induced crystallization.46

The purpose of the current work is to expand trimellitic anhydride
functionalization to graphenes with different aspect ratios and to
study the difference in effects of said functionalization on the properties
of the resulting melt-mixed PET/graphene nanocomposites. In this work,
we selected two graphenes of different aspect ratios, Af, and surface-functionalized each with trimellitic anhydride.
The modified graphenes were then melt-mixed into PET, and the internal
structure (dispersion level and interface) of the resulting PET/graphene
nanocomposites was investigated using transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) and by measuring their electrical resistance and melt rheology.

Results
and Discussion
Surface Modification of Graphene
The typically low
C/O ratio of graphene confers a hydrophobicity which results in poor
adhesion with polyester.48 For this reason,
functionalization of graphene was first conducted to enhance the interfacial
adhesion between the polymer and filler, as depicted in Scheme 1, and demonstrated in a prior
work.46 Graphene produced via chemical/thermal
reduction of GO typically contains a variety of oxygen-containing
groups including C=O, C–OH, C–O–C, COOR,
anhydride, lactone, COOH, and chemisorbed water and oxygen.49−53 The most chemically reactive of these surface groups for functionalization
are the carboxylic acid, hydroxyl, and epoxy group; the former two
in particular can be reacted with by acid chlorides.54,55 For this reason, an acid chloride carrying the trimellitic anhydride
was used to functionalize the graphene surface groups (in the presence
of pyridine to catalyze the reaction), the acid chloride reacting
with the surface and leaving behind a surface-tethered trimellitic
anhydride group.

Scheme 1 Surface Modification Reaction of Graphene with Trimellitic
Anhydride
Figure S1 demonstrates the Fourier-transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectra for graphene before and after functionalization.
Because graphene contains a lower percent of chemically bonded oxygen,
some specific peaks are hidden by the strong absorption of the graphite
structure and carbonyl groups of graphene.56 In particular, TRG2 and Modi-TRG2 showed stronger absorption than
G1 and Modi-G1, rendering it difficult to completely remove the background
for the former spectra and making it necessary to greatly enlarge
the spectra to find specific peaks, as a result of which the spectra
of TRG2 and Modi-TRG2 are far less-resolved than those of G1 and Modi-G1.
In spite of the abovementioned measurement challenges, both the modified
graphenes demonstrated aromatic C–C stretching peaks in the
benzenoid region (wavenumber around 1470 cm–1 as
shown in Figure S1).57−59 Moreover, the
absorption at 1200 cm–1 was assigned to C–OH
while the one at 1580 cm–1 was assigned to aromatic
(quinoid) C=C stretching.57 It is
noted that the ratio of C–OH to C=C peak intensity drops
post-treatment with acid chloride, indicating esterification of the
surface OH groups.46

X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) was performed on the samples
to identify and quantify functional groups, as done in our previous
studies.46 Both survey and high-resolution
scans of C 1s and O 1s for the graphenes (unfunctionalized/functionalized)
are depicted in Figures 1, S2, and 2. The
peak integrations for the O1s peak are summarized in Table 1.

All
graphenes are observed to consist only of carbon and oxygen
(Figure 1), with survey
scans showing no observable peaks of N 1s and Cl 2s in G1, Modi-G1,
TRG-2, and Modi-TRG2 as a result of using pyridine/N,N-dimethyl formamide (DMF) and acid chloride, respectively.
Additionally, the C/O ratio of all four graphenes is measured to be
8:1. Moreover, the unfunctionalized and functionalized graphenes both
show similar high-resolution scans for the C 1s peak (Figure S2), while high-resolution scans of O
1s show some difference in peaks between the two sets of materials
(Figure 2). Deconvolution
of the O 1s peak revealed five bonding environments: C=O (531.1
eV); C–OH, C–O–C (532.3 eV); COOR, anhydride,
and lactone (533.3 eV); COOH (534.2 eV); and chemisorbed water and
oxygen (536.1 eV).49−51 The most frequently occurring bonding environment
in any unmodified graphene is the (C–OH, C–O–C)
environment, as demonstrated by the prominent peak at 532.3 eV for
G1 and TRG2 (Figure 2a). Surface functionalization results in most of the C–OH
groups reacting with their acid chloride groups by alkoxy dehalogenation
as demonstrated in our former work,46 forming
COOR grafting sites for the trimellitic anhydride groups on the graphene
surface, as indicated by the sharp increase in intensity of the COOR,
anhydride, and lactone peak (Figure 2c,d and Table 1) in Modi-G1 and Modi-TRG2. Moreover, it may be noted that
the distribution of O 1s bonding environments is quantitatively similar
in G1 and TRG2, with G1 containing slightly more alcohol and carboxyl
groups, and chemisorbed (hydrogen-bonded) water, while TRG2 contains
more lactone groups.46,49−51 Finally, Modi-G1
and Modi-TRG2 are also similar in terms of O 1s bonding environments.
Because the C/O ratio is the same in G1 and TRG2 with similar functional
group surface distribution, this leads to the modified graphenes also
having the same C/O ratio and surface group distribution. In other
words, G1 and TRG2 can be compared head-to-head in terms of the aspect
ratio while safely assuming them to have the same C/O ratio and chemical
surface functionality and the same can be argued for Modi-G1 versus
Mod-TRG2. This simplifies the analysis because it means there is one
parameter to compare the two graphene systems: aspect ratio.

Figure 3 depicts
the TGA thermograms of the unfunctionalized and functionalized graphenes.
First, the weight of unmodified graphene decreased gradually at temperatures
above 200 °C. This phenomenon is due to the desorption of chemically
absorbed water and decomposition of functional groups on the graphene
surface. The weight loss experienced by G1 and TRG2 at 600 °C
is 11 and 14%, respectively. The fact that the weight loss is 3% greater
in the case of TRG2 can be attributed to two reasons: (1) TRG2 having
higher aspect and surface area-to-volume ratios, which means that
it might have more water adsorbed to it via hydrogen bonds than G1
and (2) TRG2 having higher COOR, lactone, and anhydride content than
G1. The amount of grafting was calculated based on the weight difference
in the residue at 600 °C between the unfunctionalized (G1 and
TRG2) and functionalized (Modi-G1 and Modi-TRG2) graphenes. In Figure 3, it is seen that
Modi-G1 and Modi-TRG2 experienced 4 and 6% more weight loss than G1
and TRG2, respectively, which may be explained by (1) a general rise
in the amount of trimellitic anhydride tethered to the graphene surface
postfunctionalization and (2) Modi-TRG2 containing more trimellitic
anhydride groups than Modi-G1. Scheme 1 shows that trimellitic anhydride groups occur in the
functionalized graphenes at the rates of 1 group/340 carbon atoms
in Modi-G1 and 1 group/240 carbon atoms in Modi-TRG2.

Dispersibility and Interface Morphology of
the PET/Graphene
Nanocomposites
The morphology of the melt-mixed PET/graphene
composites was analyzed using TEM and used to compare dispersibility
for the functionalized graphenes (Modi-G1 and Modi-TRG2) versus the
unfunctionalized graphenes (G1 and TRG2). The TEM images of PET/graphene
nanocomposites are shown in Figure 4. Both G1 and Modi-G1 seem well-dispersed in PET, although
some aggregates were observed. On the other hand, there appears to
be significant differences in dispersibility between TRG2 and Modi-TRG2
(Figure 4c–e).
The dispersion of TRG2 in the PET matrix is inhomogeneous; there are
visible variations in concentration of graphene in PET/TRG2 (Figure 4c,d), whereas Modi-TRG2
is well-dispersed in its PET matrix (Figure 4e,f). PET/Modi-TRG2 nanocomposites are dispersed
to a few-layer thickness, indicating that Modi-TRG2 has an enhanced
dispersibility in PET compared with TRG2 but with graphene sheet edges
that are wrinkled and twisted in the case of the former.

collected for (a) PET/G1, (b) PET/Modi-G1,46 (c) PET/TRG2 (higher concentration area), (d)
PET/TRG2 (lower concentration area), (e) PET/Modi-TRG2, and (f) PET/Modi-TRG2
[different areas from (e)] nanocomposites with 2 wt % nanofillers.

The electrical resistances of the nanocomposites
are depicted in Figure 5. As expected, all
the PET/graphene nanocomposites experience significant reductions
in electrical surface resistance compared with the pure PET. However,
the different graphenes vary greatly in percolation onset, about 4
wt % loading for G1 and Modi-G1 (Figure 5a) and 1 wt % for TRG2 and Modi-TRG2 (Figure 5b). Additionally,
the surface resistance of PET/Modi-TRG2 at 1 wt % is slightly lower
than that at 0.5 wt %, whereas that of PET/TRG2 remains the same even
as the TRG2 loading increases from 0.5 to 1 wt %. The TEM results
shown in Figure 4c–f
support the notion that PET/Modi-TRG2 can conduct electricity better
than PET/TRG2 composites around the percolation concentration, by
virtue of the more homogeneous dispersion of graphene in PET in the
case of the former. For circular disks oriented randomly within a
polymer matrix, the percolation onset limit,48 Φper, varies inversely with the aspect ratio, Af (defined as the ratio between diameter D and thickness h), as shown in eq 1(48) 1  where Φ is the volume fraction
of the
filler, Φspher (=0.29) is the percolation threshold
for randomly packed spheres, and Φper is the percolation
threshold for circular discs.60

resistance of (a) PET/G1 and PET/Modi-G146 and (b) PET/TRG2 and PET/Modi-TRG2 nanocomposites.
Dashed lines are exponential approximation lines.

In calculating the volume fraction for the graphene filler, the
values of densities used were 2.28 g/cm3 for graphene19,20 and 1.335 g/cm3 for amorphous PET [crystallinity by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) was below 5% for all samples, as shown
in Figure S3 of the Supporting Information].25,46 The calculated value of Af is 20 for G1 and Modi-G1 and around 80 for both TRG2
and Modi-TRG2. Thus, TRG2 is estimated to have an aspect ratio four
times that of G1 (and the same applies for Modi-TRG2 vs Modi-G1).

Nanocomposite Melt Rheology
Melt rheology was measured
for all nanocomposite samples to better understand the graphene dispersion
levels20,61 and the degree of molecular networking62 within each system. Figure 6 shows dynamic strain sweeps conducted at
1 rad/s for all samples, demonstrating an increase in elasticity as
a function of graphene volume fraction typical of such systems of
graphene nanocomposites.20,63 It is observed that
the G′ for the PET/functionalized graphene
nanocomposites increases more at lower graphene loadings than for
the corresponding unfunctionalized nanocomposites. All nanocomposite
systems demonstrate yield behavior at high values of strain, with G′ dropping sharply at strains above the critical
strain, γcrit. Moreover, it is noticed that γcrit shifts to lower values as the graphene loading increases,
a characteristic of fragile filler network formation.20Figure 7 depicts how γcrit varies as a function of filler
loading.

PET/Modi-TRG2 samples at 270 °C. γcrit values,
selected as the strains at which G′/G0′ = 0.9, are indicated by ∇ symbols.

strain of (a) PET/G1 and PET/Modi-G146 and
(b) PET/TRG2 and PET/Modi-TRG2 melt at 270 °C.
Measurements were conducted at 1 rad/s.

γcrit experiences a sharp drop when the volume
fraction of graphene becomes approximately 0.025 (4 wt %) for G1,
0.049 (8 wt %) for Modi-G1, between 0.006 (1.0 wt %) and 0.012 (2.0
wt %) for TRG2, and between 0.003 (0.5 wt %) and 0.006 (1.0 wt %)
for Modi-TRG2. These volume fractions imply the percolation of a graphene
network. Both dispersion uniformity and fragility of the graphene
network are similar for the G1 and Modi-G1 composites based on the
melt rheology evidence. On the other hand, γcrit of
Modi-TRG2 occurs at a lower concentration than that of TRG2, indicating
that Modi-TRG2 is better dispersed in its PET matrix than TRG2, which
is consistent with the observations based on the TEM images and the
electrical conductivity results.

Figure 8 shows the
results of dynamic frequency sweeps conducted on the nanocomposite
samples, demonstrating an initial increase in G′
at lower frequencies ω as a function of filler loading across
all samples, until the loading reaches a critical value, following
which the response becomes independent of ω. This observed trend
is a solid-like behavior normally displayed by nanosheet-laden polymer
nanocomposite melts (e.g., polymer/graphene)20,48,58,64−66 as it is a signature of the formation of networks of filler–filler
contacts. It is also observed that the rise in G′
of PET/Modi-G1 over the low frequency range is marginally higher than
with the PET/G1 system, while that for PET/Modi-TRG2 at low frequencies
is much bigger than that for PET/G2. Figure 9 depicts the behavior of G′ at a frequency ω = 0.1 rad/s for all nanocomposite
samples as a function of graphene loading. It may be observed that
the PET/Modi-G1 system displays a greater G′
than PET/G1 for graphene loadings below the percolation limit Φper (Φ < 0.025, <4 wt %). At the same time, Modi-TRG2
was observed to display greater G′ than TRG2
at all graphene loadings from 0.003 (0.5 wt %; under Φper) to 0.012 (2 wt %; above Φper), so the enhancement
achieved via graphene loading is more pronounced with TRG2 than for
Modi-TRG2. This preceding observation may be explained as follows:
Modi-G1 and Modi-TRG2 are both surface-functionalized with trimellitic
anhydride, which provides potential esterification sites for the hydroxyl
and carboxy groups on PET chains and can lead to chemical network
formation and cross-linking during the melt processing (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S2, reaction I
and II).55 In particular, this coupling
of PET is known to confer a stronger elastic character and greater
values of G′ compared with linear PET.46 Here, the number of functional groups in Modi-TRG2
is more than that in Modi-G1, meaning that the coupled network in
PET/Modi-TRG2 is denser than that in PET/Modi-G1. As a result, PET
chains in PET/Modi-TRG2 composites are more geometrically restricted
in terms of mobility than in PET/Modi-G1 composites, and thus, the
composite melts of the former show lower liquidity as a result of
functionalization (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Reaction between Modified Graphene and PET
Mechanical Properties of PET-Based Nanocomposites
Figure 10 depicts
both Young’s
modulus and elongation at break of the nanocomposites. As expected,
an enhancement effect is observed in Young’s modulus across
nanocomposite systems compared with the pure PET (Figure 10a,b): for the G1 systems,
4 wt % of filler loading leads to a Young’s modulus increase
of 4% for PET/G1 and 12% for PET/Modi-G1, while for the TRG2 systems,
2 wt % loading causes 13% modulus increase for TRG2 and 18% for Modi-TRG2.
It is thus generally observed that the inclusion of functionalized
graphene causes approximately 5% incremental rise in Young’s
modulus of the nanocomposites compared with the nonfunctionalized
graphenes. The elongation at break for all nanocomposite systems dropped
as a function of graphene loading. Elongation at break of PET/TRG2
and PET/Modi-TRG2 was similar with concentrations from 0.5 to 2.0
wt %, whereas PET/Modi-G1 displayed greater elongation at break than
PET/G1 at loadings 1.0–4.0 wt %. Figure 11 depicts the dependence between Young’s
modulus and elongation at break across nanocomposites.

modulus and elongation at break measured at 0.5
mm/s stretching rate and room temperature for (a,c) PET/G1 and PET/Modi-G146 and (b,d) PET/TRG2 and PET/Modi-TRG2.

Figure 11 Relation between Young’s modulus and elongation
at break
for the four graphenes (circles: G1 samples, squares: TRG2 samples,
white: unmodified, and red: modified).

It is observed from the figure that PET/G1 experiences a sharp
drop in the elongation at break, followed by a small increase in Young’s
modulus, which was already demonstrated in a prior work.46 PET/TRG2 showed lower elongation than PET/G1
at lower graphene loadings but increased Young’s modulus with
an increase in graphene loading. By comparison, Modi-G1 is observed
to cause a suppression of the drop in elongation at break in its PET
nanocomposites, while Modi-TRG2 was found to enhance Young’s
modulus in PET/Modi-TRG2 composites. The preceding observations indicate
that the modified graphenes have a marked effect on improving Young’s
modulus of composites in the case of the higher-aspect ratio Modi-TRG2,
while they suppress the decrease of elongation in the case of the
lower-aspect ratio Modi-G1.

Enhancement Mechanism of Mechanical Properties
The
preceding set of observations leads us to propose an explanatory model
for the mechanical property enhancement of the functionalized graphenes
on the PET/graphene nanocomposites. As described in our previous study,46 PET/low Af graphene
nanocomposites can be plastically deformed, with the grafted PET chains
on Modi-G1 enhancing interfacial adhesion with the polymer matrix
during melt-processing and forming a coupled network while maintaining
a similar overall level of dispersibility. Stronger interfacial adhesion
results in high stress transfer efficiency from the PET matrix to
the graphenes,67−71 and the coupled network which is formed suppresses both strain-induced
orientation and strain-induced crystallization during deformation
of the nanocomposites, resulting in additional enhancement both of
Young’s modulus and elongation at break over nanocomposite
samples prepared using unmodified G1. The same functionalization conducted
on a higher-aspect ratio graphene revealed a different trend: the
higher aspect ratio and specific surface area of TRG2 cause it to
disperse inhomogeneously in the PET matrix with lower interfacial
adhesion prior to functionalization, resulting in a minor improvement
effect of mechanical properties of the PET-based nanocomposites. On
the other hand, Modi-TRG2 enhances dispersion homogeneity via enhancement
of graphene wettability and dispersibility in the PET matrix by grafted
PET chains. Additionally, PET/Modi-TRG2 forms stronger interfaces
and a denser network. The stronger interfacial adhesion in functionalized
graphenes (especially, Modi-TRG2) stabilizes the interface formed
between the PET matrix and graphene while improving stress transfer
efficiency between the two,72 leading to
an additional enhancement in Young’s modulus of the nanocomposites
as a result of using the functionalized high-Af graphene. The reason that PET/Modi-TRG2 did not improve the
elongation at break is thought to be the difference in filler size
(aspect ratio) and mobility of PET chains. The PET chains in nanocomposites
with higher-aspect ratio graphenes are more geometrically restricted
than chains in composites of the lower-aspect ratio graphenes.25,73 These PET chains can be normally pulled off from an entanglement
of PET chains during deformation and the deformation energy is absorbed
during the unentanglement process, resulting in plastic deformation.
However, this is not allowed in the cases of the TRG2 and Modi-TRG2
composites because of stronger restrictions of the molecular chain
by the higher-aspect ratio graphenes via chain confinement effects,25 which hinders PET chains from unentanglement
during deformation, resulting in lower capacity to absorb deformation
energy and thus brittle fracture. However, the denser coupled network
and stronger interface adhesion in PET/Modi-TRG2 composites compared
with PET/TRG2 lead to more effective stress transfer efficiency between
PET and graphene. Therefore, the increase in the amount of surface
modification is thought to be responsible for the drastic improvement
in Young’s modulus of PET/Modi-TRG2 compared with PET/TRG2.

Conclusions
Trimellitic anhydride functionalization was
conducted on two thermally
reduced graphenes of different aspect ratios, Af, and the same C/O ratio (8:1). The impact of this functionalization
was studied on improving the dispersion quality of melt-mixed nanocomposites
of graphene and PET. Nanocomposites with low-Af graphene (PET/G1 and PET/Modi-G1) showed similar dispersion
as shown both by melt rheology and electrical resistance. In this
case, the grafted PET chains on Modi-G1 during melt-processing enhanced
the interfacial adhesion and formed a coupled network, as a result
of which strain-induced orientation and strain-induced crystallization
were suppressed because of the presence of functionalized graphene,
resulting to enhance Young’s modulus and higher elongation
as reported in our previous study.46 On
the other hand, the nanocomposites with higher Af graphene (PET/TRG2 and PET/Modi-TRG2) showed a different
tendency, displaying a lower elongation at break than in composites
of the lower-Af graphenes because of the
difficulty in pulling off molecular chains in the case of the former.
The PET/Modi-TRG2 composites formed a more homogeneous dispersion,
stronger interfacial adhesion, and denser coupled networks than those
of PET/TRG2 composites because of denser coupled network and stronger
interface adhesion in PET/Modi-TRG2 composites which lead to effective
stress transfer efficiency between the PET and graphene, resulting
in a drastic improvement in Young’s modulus. This was, however,
not accompanied with a corresponding improvement in the elongation
at break because of the higher geometrical chain restriction in the
presence of the high-aspect ratio TRG2 graphene. The preceding observations
demonstrate the potential impacts of tuning both surface chemistry
and aspect ratio of graphene in the fabrication of PET/graphene composites.

viscosity 0.61 dL/g (in ortho-chlorophenol), used
in our previous work46) was produced by
grinding the pellets [obtained from Toray Plastics America (North
Kingstown, RI)] using PolyVision (Manchester, PA). Multilayered graphene
was used as nanofillers. The thermally reduced graphenes, G1 (XG Science,
xGnP-C750, thickness 2 nm, diameter < 2 μm, surface area
∼700 m2/g, used in our previous work46), and TRG2 (Vorbeck Materials, produced by thermal
exfoliation of GO produced via the Staudenmaier method,74 with a specific surface area of ∼800
m2/g). Anhydrous DMF (EMD Chemicals Inc.), anhydrous pyridine
(Sigma-Aldrich), and 1,2,4-benzenetricarboxylic anhydride acid chloride
(trimellitic anhydride acid chloride, AK Scientific, Inc.) were all
used as received as per our previous work.46

Surface Modification of Graphene
The surface functionalization
of the graphene (Modi-G1 from G1 and Modi-TRG2 from TRG2, respectively)
was conducted following the same method published on our previous
work.46

Preparation of Nanocomposites
with PET
The PET/unmodified
or modified graphene nanocomposites were prepared by melt-blending,
and thin samples for performing TEM and measuring electrical resistance
and mechanical properties were prepared by melt-pressing following
the method used in our previous study.46 PET powder, unmodified or modified graphene, and the obtained nanocomposites
were vacuum-dried at 120 °C for more than 12 h prior to melt-pressing.

Characterization
Characterization of samples was conducted
using following equipment. Detailed procedure and measurement parameters
are reported elsewhere.46

FT-IR spectra
of graphene and modified graphene were collected using a Magna IR-750
spectrometer (Nicolet Instrument, Madison WI) with the attenuated
total reflection method49−53

XPS of all graphenes (unfunctionalized/functionalized) were
acquired
via a Surface Science 555 instrument with Mg Kα radiation to
understand the different bonding environments within the graphenes.49−53

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) of the graphenes was conducted
via a PerkinElmer Pyris Diamond TG/DTA 6300 instrument.

Dispersion,
intercalation, and exfoliation of graphene were all
visualized via TEM using an FEI Tecnai T12 instrument with 120 kV
as the accelerating voltage.

Surface resistance of nanocomposite
films was measured using an
11-probe dc resistance meter (Prostat-801).

The rheology of
the nanocomposite samples was measured using a
strain-controlled rotational rheometer (ARES, TA Instruments) at 270
°C under an inert N2 blanket.

DSC measurements
were performed using a TA Instruments Q1000 to
investigate the crystallinity of nanocomposite films. All measurements
were carried out in a N2 atmosphere.

The mechanical
properties of the nanocomposite samples were measured
using a rheometrics solid analyzer, RSA-G2 (TA Instruments, New Castle,
DE).
