In this work, novel three-dimensional
nitrocellulose/glycidyl azide polymer/submicron-2,2′, 4,4′,
6,6′-hexanitro-stilbene (NC/GAP/submicron-HNS) composite fibers
were prepared by the electrospinning method. As-prepared NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
fibers were continuous and possessed a large specific surface area.
The structure of fibers was characterized by energy-dispersive X-ray,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (IR). The results showed that HNS submicron
particles were uniformly loaded on the surface of NC/GAP fibers and
incorporated with it. Thermal analyses were performed. Such NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
fibers showed a low activation energy of 204 kJ·mol–1 and large rate constant of 1.74 s–1, indicating
high reactivity and fast reaction rate. The result of TG-IR analysis
revealed that the main decomposition products of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
were CO2, CO, H2O, N2O, few NO, and
fragments such as −CH2O– and −CH–,
which were low-signature gases. An evaluation on the energy performance
disclosed that the standard specific impulse (Isp) of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fibers was 2032 N·s·kg–1, which was higher than 2014 N·s·kg–1 of NC/GAP. This meant the addition of HNS submicron
particles to the NC/GAP fiber was favorable to the improvement of
energy performance. Additionally, introduction of submicron-HNS made
the energetic fibers becoming very insensitive to impact action. It
was expected that as-prepared NC/GAP/submicron-HNS membranes were
promising materials applied for solid rocket propellant.

1 Introduction
2,2′,4,4′,6,6′-Hexanitrostilbene
(HNS) is one of the most excellent explosives owing to its superior
thermostability, low sensitivity, high density, and high specific
impulse.1−3 HNS is usually
used in pyrotechnics and plays an important role in the aerospace
field.4−6 Especially,
the development of aerospace technology puts forward higher requirements
on energetic materials.7−9 Submicron-HNS
show a more wonderful performance than traditional HNS.10,11 However, HNS submicron particles is prone to aggregation because
of the high surface energy of submicron materials.12−14 Thus, it is very much desired that submicron-HNS
particles can load on the surface of a kind of carrier with a high
performance, by which the dispersion of submicron-HNS particles are
improved remarkably.

Electrospinning is a multipurpose technology
applied for fabricating 3D fiber films.15−20 Explosive submicron particles
are introduced into fiber matrix through electrospinning technology
to prepare composite fibers. It can not only alleviate the agglomeration
but also improve the combustion performance. There are few reports
on the preparation of energetic composite fibers. Yan prepared nitrocellulose/aluminum–cupric
oxide (NC/Al–CuO) fiber via electrospinning, which has a very
high burning rate.21 Li realized the incorporation
of nanoboron and NC fiber via electrospinning.22 Li found that the activation energy for decomposition of
NC/2,4,6,8,10,12-hexanitro-2,4,6,8,10,12-hexaazaisowurtzitane (NC/CL-20)
fibers were significantly reduced compared with raw CL-20.23 All of these researchers have focused on the
use of single NC as the substrate for electrospun. However, there
will be a major matter with the single NC as the precursor solution,
that is, the viscosity is too high. In fact, the harm of high viscosity
mainly includes two aspects. First, it makes the electrospun process
difficult. Second, it leads to a serious decrease in the load of submicron
particles. Thus, in the electrospun process, a polymer, which is of
low viscosity and high performance, is desired to incorporate with
NC. For this, glycidyl azidepolymer (GAP) catches our attention, owing
to its high-energy performance, high burning rate, and low viscosity.24−26 Therefore, herein, we employ
NC/GAP composites as the matrix to load submicron-HNS via electrospun.
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fibers are expected to have excellent energetic
properties.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Morphology
and Structure
Scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of
milled HNS are shown in Figure 1a,b. It is obvious that HNS submicron particles are of spheroid
shape. The particle diameter distribution of HNS is calculated by
measuring the diameter of ∼100 HNS particles. Figure 1c,d shows that the mean size
of the milled HNS is d50 = 0.154 μm.
The volume curve is obtained by integrating the frequency curve. Please
note that the d90 of the milled HNS is
0.199 μm, which implies that 90 vol % the particles are with
the size less than 0.199 μm. Thus, the milled sample is called
as “submicron-HNS”. The SEM images of NC/GAP and NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
fibers are displayed in Figure 2. It is obvious that a 3D network structure forms. The NC/GAP
fiber presented in Figure 2a,c appears consecutive and uniform, and its surface is quite
smooth. In Figure 3b,d, the submicron-HNS particles are closely fixed on the surface
of NC/GAP fiber and incorporate with NC/GAP. Hence, the surface of
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is very rough in comparison with surface of NC/GAP.
The introduction of submicron-HNS makes the precursor solution heterogeneous.
Thus, the aggregation of HNS submicron particles exists during electrospinning,
which is displayed in Figure 2b,d. The Fiber diameter distribution is calculated by measuring
the diameter of ∼100 fibers, and the results are shown in Figure 2e–h. For NC/GAP,
the mean diameter calculated from the frequency curve is 0.469 μm
which is similar to the median diameter (d50 = 0.478 μm). The mean diameters of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS are
1.074 and 1.042 μm, respectively. It is clear that the diameter
of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is larger than diameter of NC/GAP. This is
because HNS submicron particles are closely coated on the surface
of NC/GAP.

The results of EDS analysis are displayed in Figure 3. Figure 3a,b confirms that there are
(C, N, and O) three elements existing on the surface of both NC/GAP
fibers, demonstrating that the impurity has not been introduced in
the process of ball milling and electrospinning, and NC/GAP/submicron-HNS. Figure 3c–h shows
the EDS maps of the C, N, and O elements, and the specific element
contents are listed in Table 1. It is clear that after coating with submicron-HNS, the N
content is significantly reduced, and the contents of O and C increase
appreciably. This consists with the element distribution in molecules
of HNS, NC, and GAP.

IR analysis is conducted and the spectra
are shown in Figure 4a. For NC/GAP/submicron-HNS, the peak at 1083 cm–1 indicates the out-of-plane bending vibration of C–H; the
peak at 2101 cm–1 reflects the stretching vibration
of −N3 in present GAP;25 the peak at 1279 and 1646 cm–1 relate to symmetric
and antisymmetric stretching vibrations of −ONO2, respectively; the peaks at 1339 and 1532 cm–1 correspond to the symmetric and antisymmetric stretching vibrations
of −NO2; and the peak at 3100 cm–1 is ascribed to the stretching vibrations of −C–H in
CH=; the peak located at 1602 cm–1 corresponds
to the stretching vibrations of the C=C skeleton in the benzene
ring. These peaks match with the molecular structure of HNS,13 confirming the existence of submicron-HNS on
the surface of the NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fiber. The high-voltage electrostatic
force during electrospinning does not bring about the molecular structure
change of submicron-HNS and NC/GAP. No chemical reaction occurs among
NC, GAP, and HNS, hence, there are no new chemical bonds produced.
The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of submicron-HNS, NC/GAP, and
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS are shown in Figure 4b. Submicron-HNS is a kind of crystal, and
many diffraction peaks appear in its pattern. The NC/GAP fiber is
a kind of polymer, and there is no diffraction peak in its pattern.
The XRD pattern of the composite fiber shows that some HNS crystal
incorporates with the NC/GAP polymer. The crystal phase of HNS does
not transform during the process of electrospinning. It has been shown
in the literature that for nitramine explosives such as HNIW crystal
transformation will occur during recrystallization. For example, Song
prepared nano-HNIW using sol–gel, supercritical desiccation,
etching, and the crystal phase of HNIW transformed from ε-HNIW
into α-HNIW.27 Herein, HNS is insoluble
in acetone. We select acetone to prepare the precursor solution, avoiding
recrystal of HNS.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis
is conducted to further characterize the surface elements of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS,
and the result is displayed in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the peaks at 285.2, 407, and 534 eV are assigned to the
binding energy of C 1s, N 1s, and O 1s, respectively. Figure 5b displays the C1s spectrum.
Three peaks at 284.5, 286.5, and 288.1 eV relates to C–C, C–N,
and C–O, respectively. Figure 5c illustrates the N 1s spectrum, in which four types
of nitrogen atoms with different chemical states were detected.28 The peak at 400.2 eV is assigned to the −N3 group in GAP molecules. The peaks at 400.6 and 404.2 eV correspond
to the −NO2 and C–N in HNS molecules. The
peak at 407.8 eV attributes to the presence of −ONO2 in NC molecules. Figure 5d shows the O 1s spectrum. The O 1s spectrum comprises four
peaks located at 531.8, 532.6, 533.6, and 534.4 eV, which is ascribed
to C–O, −NO2, −O*–NO2, and −O–NO2* groups, respectively.29 Upon these, we deduce that HNS exists at the surface of the composite
fiber.

Figure 6 shows the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms of
NC/GAP and NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fibers. The specific surface area,
pore volume, and pore size of samples are exhibited in Table 2. The curve is typical IV adsorption
isotherms with H3-type hysteresis loop.30 It possesses the feature of the mesoporous material. Single-molecule
adsorption exists in the low specific pressure zone, but there is
no obvious boundary between single-molecule adsorption and subsequent
multilayer adsorption. Capillary condensation occurs when the adsorbed
layer on the pore walls reaches a sufficient thickness during the
adsorption process, and when desorption is carried out at the same p/po as adsorption, only the
molecules on the surface of the capillary are desorbed. Hence, it
does not desorb the molecules adsorbed under p/po. To desorb it, a smaller p/po is required, so the hysteresis of
desorption arises. The specific surface area of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
was somewhat larger than that of NC/GAP, probably attributed to the
rough surface of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS. Electrospun fibers have larger
specific surface area than energetic composite fabricated by other
methods. The specific surface area of NC/GAP/CL-20 prepared by sol–gel
is lower than that NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fibers.31

2.2 Thermal
Analysis
Differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) traces of
samples collected at different heating rates are shown in Figure 7a–c. The kinetic
and thermodynamic parameters for thermal decomposition of samples
are calculated with their DSC data, and the results are listed in Table 3. For all samples,
the peak temperature increases as the heating rate increases. For
submicron-HNS, there is a slight endothermic peak just before decomposition,
corresponding to melting of submicron-HNS. For NC/GAP/submicron-HNS,
there is only one exothermic peak, indicating that the NC and GAP
decompose simultaneously. Furthermore, the exothermic peak temperature
of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is lower than those of NC/GAP and submicron-HNS.
Please note that for NC/GAP/submicron-HNS, there is also only one
exothermic peak existing in the DSC trace. This means that NC, GAP,
and submicron-HNS decompose simultaneously. Meanwhile, the peak temperature
for NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is somewhat lower than that of NC/GAP and
is substantially lower than that of submicron-NHS. Thus, we propose
that decompositions of NC, GAP, and submicron-HNS induce each other.
NC and GAP have a strong induction and catalysis for the thermal decomposition
of HNS, which causes HNS to decompose in advance. Meanwhile, the heat
released by HNS benefits to the thermal decomposition of NC and GAP.
Overall, the thermolysis of NC, HNS submicron particles, and GAP cooperates
with each other. What counts is that the specific surface area of
the fibers obtained by electrospinning is relatively large and the
submicron-HNS is closely dispersed in the NC/GAP fibers. Hence, the
thermal conductivity is high, the heat-mass transfer process is easier,
and the thermal decomposition temperature is lower.32 The apparent activation energy (Ek), pre-exponential factor (Ak),
and rate constant (k) are calculated by Kissinger
equation (eq 1) and Arrhenius
equation (eq 2).33 The Ek for NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
is 204 kJ·mol–1, which is higher than Ek for NC/GAP and is lower than Ek for submicron-HNS. The k value for
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is higher than the other two. These mean that
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is of a high decomposition rate. The thermal
decomposition of energetic molecules begins at the activation and
rupture of the weakest bond, which are quite significant to the decomposition
process. As the temperature elevates, thermal motion of molecules
becomes violent. When the temperature attained the critical point,
the weakest bond is stretched and then the rupture occurs. The activation
course could be depicted by the parameters such as activation enthalpy
(ΔH≠), activation free energy
(ΔG≠), and activation entropy
(ΔS≠), which are calculated
by eqs 3–5. ΔG≠ means
the chemical potential of the explosive molecule in the activation
reaction, whose values are positive numbers, implying that all activation
processes are nonspontaneous. ΔH≠ represents the energy required for molecular activation. Compared
with submicron-HNS, the activation process of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
need less energy. Figure 7e shows kinetic compensation effect among decomposition of
the three samples. It indicates that the three points do not locate
in a straight line. This means that in kinetics, the decomposition
mechanisms of the three samples are different. 1   2   3   4   5

To further investigate
the decomposition mechanism of the samples, TG-IR analysis is employed
to reveal the gas products for thermolysis of NC/GAP and NC/GAP/submicron-HNS.
The TG and DTG curves are shown in Figure 8a,b, and the IR spectra extracted at different
temperatures are presented in Figure 8c,d. Figure 8a indicates that the decomposition of NC/GAP initiates at
177 °C and its decomposition rate reaches the highest value at
197 °C; the decomposition ends at 199 °C. For NC/GAP/submicron-HNS,
the onset temperature increases to 188 °C; the highest value
is at 194 °C; the decomposition ends at 200 °C. This means
that the decomposition process of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is more concentrated.
In IR spectra, the peaks located at 2308–2360 cm–1 relate to the existence of CO2. The weak peak at 2240
cm–1 indicates the existence of few N2O gas. The existence of NO accounts for the peak located at 1908–1920
cm–1. The peaks located at 3264–3345 and
1667–1780 cm–1 correspond to the existence
of −CH and CH2O fragments, respectively. The peak
in 2096–2177 cm–1 represents the existence
of CO. The −N3 group, which is an energetic group
of GAP, should decompose to N2. However, N2 is
a kind of nonpolar molecule and cannot be detected by IR spectrometer.
The decomposition products of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS are almost same
as that of NC/GAP. The only difference lies in the existence of −C–O–C–
fragments in the case of NC/GAP, that is, there are no −C–O–C–
fragments existing in decomposition products of NC/GAP/submicron-NHS.
Additionally, for NC/GAP/submicron-HNS, the peak intensity of −CH2O fragments is obviously lower than that for NC/GAP. These
imply that more −C–O–C– and CH2O fragments are oxidized to CO2, CO, and H2O in the case of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS because the introduction of
submicron-HNS improves the oxygen balance of the fiber. The signal
of CO2 is stronger than others for both samples. CO2 is a ideal product gas.10 This
is because more CO2 in decomposition products benefits
to heat liberation of the decomposition, owing to the lowest formation
enthalpy of CO2 compared with other gas products such as
CO, N2O, and NO.

2.3 Energetic Properties
It is important to test the sensitivity
and evaluate the energy performance of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS because
these two aspects exhibit their energetic properties. The standard
specific impulse (Isp), characteristic
velocity (C*), combustion chamber temperature (Tc), and average molecular weight of combustion
products (Mc) are calculated and the results
are listed in Table 4. Meanwhile, the impact sensitivity of submicron-HNS, NC/GAP, and
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS are tested and the results are also tabulated
in Table 4. Moreover,
the combustion products and their molar ratio are calculated and the
results are shown in Figure 10. In the sensitivity test, the special height (H50) of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is obviously higher than H50 of NC/GAP and is slightly lower than H50 of submicron-HNS. This means that the impact
sensitivity of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS is clearly lower than that of
NC/GAP and is somewhat higher than that of submicron-HNS, that is,
introduction of submicron-HNS benefits to the decrease of impact sensitivity.
For energy performance, it is distinct that Isp of NC/GAP/HNS is higher than Isp of NC/GAP. However, this does not mean that HNS is a kind of high-energy
explosive, and the real reason should be ascribed to the higher formation
enthalpy (ΔHf) and higher C/H mass
ratio of HNS compared with those of NC/GAP.31,34 Especially,
the ΔHf of HNS is up to +128.03
kJ·kg–1, but the ΔHf of NC (50%)/GAP (50%) is low to −1188.8 kJ·kg–1. Hence, the introduction of HNS to NC/GAP is quite
beneficial to the improvement of the energy performance in thermodynamics.
In addition, the C/H mass ratio of HNS is 28.03, but that of NC (50%)/GAP
(50%) is mere 8.36. Please note that the value of oxygen balance (OBCO2) is also important for evaluating the energy
performance. For different samples, their values of the C/H mass ratio
are of comparability only under the condition that the samples are
of closed OBCO2 values. OBCO2 of HNS is −67.5% which is close to the OBCO2 of NC (50%)/GAP (50%) (−78.1%). Upon this, we
conclude that obviously the higher C/H mass ratio results in a remarkable
increase in combustion temperature (Tc), which accounts for the result listed in Table 4. The value of Tc is determined by the heat release from the combustion of propellants,
which represents the chemical energy storage of an energetic formulation. Figure 9c reveals that the
value of Tc increases linearly with increasing
of weight percent of HNS. This indicates that chemical energy storage
of HNS is higher than that of NC/GAP. Of course, for energy performance,
the discrepancy cannot be fully explained only on the aspect of chemical
energy storage. The work done by the gas products is also very important.
Heat released from the combustion of propellant must be converted
to work as much as possible. This is called “energy conversion
efficiency”. The hydrogen content in the molecules of energetic
materials is responsible for this. The decrease of hydrogen content
leads to an increase of average molecular weight (Mc), which is adverse to energy conversion efficiency of
the combustion. Higher hydrogen content in energetic molecules will
result in higher H2 percent in the combustion products. Figure 10a,b indicates that the H2 percent for combustion
of NC (50%)/GAP (50%) reaches 28% and the H2 percent for
combustion of HNS is only 14%. This accounts for the high Mc value of HNS compared with low Mc value of NC/GAP. Thus, Figure 9d shows that Mc increases with increasing of weight percent of HNS. Lower Mc value means that the same heat, released from
combustion of propellants, does less work. However, herein, despite
the lower Mc value, NC/GAP also possesses
an obviously lower Isp than HNS. This
is because for NC/GAP, its rich hydrogen content cannot compensate
its poor C/H mass ratio, that is, the storage of chemical energy dominates
the energy performance. Of course, besides the C/H mass ratio, high
formation enthalpy of HNS also contributes its high chemical energy
storage. Therefore, introduction of HNS to the NC/GAP fiber is favorable
to the improvement of energy performance.

3 Conclusions
The NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
fiber membrane is successfully prepared by the electrospinning method,
in which HNS submicron particles incorporate with NC/GAP fibers. With
the submicron-HNS being assembled in the NC/GAP matrix, the decomposition
temperature as well as activation energy could be significantly decreased,
and decomposition rate should be remarkably improved. This suggests
that the NC/GAP/submicron-HNS fibers decompose comparatively easily
and rapidly. Thermal decomposition of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS occurs
at relatively low-temperature range of 174–185 °C. The
decomposition products of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS are similar to that
of NC/GAP. The quite clean products enable NC/GAP/submicron-HNS to
be a prospective candidate material in low-signature propellants.

Both energy performance and safety are pivotal properties of energetic
materials. The introduction of submicron-HNS to NC/GAP fiber leads
to increases of Tc and Isp, which means addition of HNS is propitious to the enhancement
of energy performance. The impact sensitivity of NC/GAP/submicron-HNS
is obviously lower than that of NC/GAP, illustrating that as-spun
NC/GAP/submicron-HNS possesses observable safety. Therefore, the composite
fiber shows a potential application in solid propellants. It is believed
that this operable technology is universal and could be used to fabricate
other energetic composite fibers.

4.1 Materials
Raw 2,2′,4,4′,6,6′-hexanitro-stilbene
(HNS) was obtained from Gansu Yinguang Chemical Co., Ltd (Baiyin city,
Gansu province, P. R. China). NC (12.6% N, industrial grade) was purchased
from Foshan Junyuan Chemical Co., Ltd (Foshan city, Guangdong province,
P. R. China). GAP (Mn = 4000, hydroxyl
value of 0.49 mmol·g–1) was purchased from
the 42nd Institute of the Fourth Academy of China Aerospace Science
and Technology Corporation. Ethanol (EtOH) and acetone were purchased
from Tianjin Guangfu Chemical Co., Ltd (Tianjin city, China).

4.2 Preparation of NC/GAP/Submicron-HNS
Composite Fiber
First, submicron-HNS was obtained by the
mechanical milling method. The ingredients, including 200 g balls,
6 g HNS, 60 mL deionized water, and 60 mL etOH, were added into a
mill jar. Four jars were sealed and fixed on the ball mill. The mill
rotated at 350 rpm for 6 h. The HNS submicron particles were separated
from the suspension and dried by freeze drying. The 0.3 g submicron-HNS
was added into 4.4 g acetone to obtain suspension solution (a). 0.45
g NC and 0.45 g GAP were dissolved into 4.4 g acetone to obtain solution
(b). Suspension solution (a) was slowly introduced into solution (b)
to form the precursor solution (12 wt %), in which the mass ratio
of NC, GAP, and submicron-HNS was set to 3:3:2. For comparison, NC/GAP
precursor solution (12 wt %) was also prepared by dissolving 0.6 g
NC and 0.6 g GAP into 8.8 g acetone, in which the mass ratio of NC
and GAP was set to 1:1. In both electrospinning processes, the inner
diameter of the needle is 0.8 mm; the flow rate was set as 3–5
mL·h–1, and the applied voltage was fixed at
12–18 kV; the collection distance was kept at 12 cm; the humidity
was controlled at 40–50%. The obtained electrospun fibers were
collected on an aluminum foil. The preparation scheme is described
in Figure 11.

The morphology of fiber is observed by a SEM (Hitachi SU8010). energy-dispersive
X-ray, XRD, XPS, and IR analyses were conducted to characterize the
structure of fibers. The diameter of particles and fibers are measured
by the software Nano Measurer 1.2.5. The XRD analysis is performed
on a DX-2700 X-ray diffractometer (Haoyuan) with Cu Kα radiation.
The IR spectrum is obtained on an infrared spectrometer (American
Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet 6700). XPS is conducted with XPS
and a PHI5000 Versa-Probe (ULVAC-PHI). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) measurements are performed utilizing the nitrogen adsorption
with the Micromeritics ASAP 2010 instrument. Thermal analysis is conducted
on a DSC (TA Model Q600) at heating rates of 5, 10, 15, and 20 °C/min.
TG-IR analysis is performed on a thermal analyzer system (TG/DSC,
Mettler Toledo) coupled with a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
in the nitrogen atmosphere. The impact sensitivity of samples is tested
by using an HGZ-1 impact equipment.
