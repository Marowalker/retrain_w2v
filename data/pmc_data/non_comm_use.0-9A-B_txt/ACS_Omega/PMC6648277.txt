Herein,
we describe the production of poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) [P(HB-HV)]-based microspheres containing
coumarin-6 (C6) or pyrene (Py) fluorophores as additives and models
for hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug encapsulation. Their photophysical
and morphological properties, as well as encapsulation efficiencies,
are studied as this work aims to describe the influence of additive
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity on microparticle formation. These properties
were studied by scanning electron microscopy, fluorescence confocal
laser scanning microscopy (FCLSM), and steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy.
The results show that the surfactant concentration, polymer molar
mass, emulsification stirring rate, and the presence of the fluorophore
and its nature are determinants of the P(HB-HV) microsphere properties.
Also, encapsulation efficiency is shown to be governed by synergic
effects of these parameters on the formation of microspheres. Moreover,
size distribution is proved to be strongly influenced by the surfactant
poly(vinyl alcohol) content. FCLSM showed that the fluorophores were
efficiently encapsulated in P(HB-HV) microspheres at distinct distributions
within the copolymer matrix. Surprisingly, nanospheres were observed
in the microsphere surface, suggesting that microspheres are formed
from nanosphere coalescence.

1 Introduction
Biodegradable
polymer microspheres have been extensively investigated
as potential carriers for drugs,1−4 cosmetic products,5−7 delivery systems, and
for diagnostic purposes because of their biocompatibility, biodegradability,
stability, and sustained-release properties.8,9 Among
the most studied materials for encapsulation are derivatives of poly(d,l-lactide), poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA), and poly-ε-caprolactones,10 and the most widespread mechanism for encapsulation
with them is the total enfold of the molecule of interest by the polymeric
thin film to generate a spherical microparticle.

Among the polymers
that can produce microspheres, poly(hydroxybutyrate)
(PHB) and its copolymer with hydroxyvalerate (P(HB-HV)) have attracted
the scientific interest, especially in biomedical field, because of
its unique tunable mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability.11,12 These polymers, obtained from natural raw materials,13,14 are considered green polymers, as they belong to the family of bacterial
storage polyesters, which is another reason for their growing application.15−17

Drug delivery efficiency of these polymers can be controlled
by
tuning the polymer properties upon structure modification, for instance.
With this regard, sulfamethizole-containing P(HB-HV) microparticles
have presented slower drug release rates than PHB homopolymer-based
microparticles18 and distinct profiles,
upon microparticles produced from P(HB-HV) of distinct HV contents.19−21

Delivery systems consisting of biodegradable polymer spheres22−31 are interesting because they present several special characteristics,
such as high surface-to-volume ratio, low density, and low coefficient
of thermal expansion, which enable an efficient encapsulation and
time-controlled drug release.32 With this
respect, it is important to ensure the internal and external morphology
control of the microspheres, as they can influence the interaction
with both the encapsulated drug and the microenvironment after the
drug delivery. For this purpose, particles can be prepared by several
methods, including oil/water emulsion and drying by solvent evaporation.14,33−35 Although not new, emulsion techniques are very convenient
to prepare microspheres, when a single emulsion is employed, or microcapsules,
when double emulsions are employed. Both can encapsulate hydrophobic
compounds, therefore, most drugs and chemical compounds.36−40 Poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is the most common emulsion stabilizer
to achieve polymeric nano- and microparticles of PLGA, PHB, and P(HB-HV),
allowing the preparation of small-sized particles with uniform diameter
distribution.41 Emulsifier identity and
concentration play important roles in the physical–chemical
and pharmaceutical properties of polymeric microspheres, including
encapsulation efficiency, size and morphology, size distribution,
surface chemistry and hydrophobicity, capture efficiency of the microparticles
by macrophages, zeta-potential (ζ-potential), and release profile.42 Changes in the surface properties have also
been used as a strategy to obtain a controlled and sustained release
of fluorescent probes.43−46

Regarding the release kinetics and efficiency, the control
over
the polydispersity in the size and morphology of the nano-/microsphere
is indispensable to optimize the rates of particle degradation, drug
stability, and release kinetics.47,48 It has been
demonstrated that smaller particles present higher release rates because
of the shorter diffusion paths promoted by the higher surface/volume
ratio.45,49

Nevertheless, for some applications,
biocompatible and biodegradable
nanoparticles are needed.50−53 For instance, Eke et al.54 conducted a study in which they compared the in vitro and transdermal
penetration of PHB biodegradable micro-/nanoparticles. They showed
that the size distribution of nanospheres is more uniform and that
skin penetration and cellular uptake efficiency are the best for nanoparticles
up to 500 nm,54 whereas microspheres were
not able to penetrate cell membranes. The spheres were produced by
the oil-in-water method, which is similar to our approach, and the
stirring rates were also controlled to obtain spheres of distinct
sizes.54 Mekala & Rajendran55 also synthesized PHB nanospheres containing
the drug ampicillin by the method of interfacial deposition, in which
the drug in a water-miscible organic solvent is mixed with an aqueous
solution of an emulsifier, leading to nucleation and growth of drug
particles stabilized by the emulsifier.52

Among the techniques employed by researchers to characterize
microparticles,
fluorescence confocal laser scanning microscopy (FCLSM) has been widely
applied to identify several structures as it enables to explore distinctively
the surface and the inner portion of a particle.56−63

In this work, to attain more reliable microsphere formulation
parameters
and to comprehend the effect additives of distinct hydrophobicity
may have on the microsphere formation, we prepared poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) P(HB-HV) microspheres by the water–oil
emulsion technique64 and, by steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy and by FCLSM, we determined the encapsulation
efficiencies of the selected fluorophores, the polar coumarin-6 (C6)
and the nonpolar pyrene (Py), which were used in this work as models
for hydrophobic and hydrophilic drug encapsulation. Particle sizes,
size distribution, and the effect of the use of these fluorophores
as additives on the microsphere structures were evaluated by steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and
ζ-potential measurements. Also, the controlled release of the
fluorophores from the microspheres produced via distinct protocols
was studied by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, and FCLSM was
applied as a tool to evaluate fluorophore entrapment within microspheres.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Microsphere Production
and Characterization
P(HB-HV) microspheres containing fluorophores
and microspheres
without fluorophores were produced by mixing P(HB-HV) of two distinct
molar masses (130 and 450 kg mol–1) to a PVA emulsifier
in a 1.0% w/v content, and the role of the P(HB-HV) copolymer molar
mass on the size and size distribution of the produced microspheres
was evaluated.

Regarding morphology, Figure 1 presents the X-ray diffraction plots obtained
for P(HB-HV)-casted films and microspheres obtained from copolymers
with distinct molar masses. It is noteworthy that they are all semicrystalline
and that the microspheres present lower degrees of crystallinity than
the pure polymer, being 29% for microspheres produced from P(HB-HV)
of M̅w = 450 kg mol–1 and 32% for microspheres formed from P(HB-HV) of M̅w = 130 kg mol–1, whereas
films produced with both polymers are 41% crystalline. Figure 2 shows that P(HB-HV) microspheres
prepared with the polymers of both molar masses presented a high degree
of coalescence and porous surface; moreover, those prepared with P(HB-HV)
of M̅w = 130 kg mol–1 presented a broad size distribution (from 30 to 400 μm), whereas
those prepared with P(HB-HV) of M̅w = 450 kg mol–1 presented a very narrow size distribution.

Figure 1 P(HB-HV)
X-ray diffraction plots obtained for the casted film of
P(HB-HV), Mw = 130 kg mol–1 (light diamonds––straight line); casted film of P(HB-HV), Mw = 450 kg mol–1 (dark squares––straight
line); microspheres of P(HB-HV) of Mw =
130 kg mol–1 (straight line); and microspheres of
P(HB-HV) of Mw = 450 kg mol–1 (open circles––straight line).

Figure 2 SEM images of 1.0% w/v P(HB-HV) microspheres produced with 1.0%
w/v PVA, 300 rpm: (A) M̅w(P(HB-HV))
= 130 kg mol–1and (B) its size distribution; (C) M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 450 kg mol–1 and (D) its size distribution.

To avoid coalescence, distinct contents of the surfactant
PVA were
added (2.0 and 3.0% w/v), resulting in remarkably reduced average
diameters and sharper size distribution for both molar masses with
PVA content increase, as evidenced by Figure 3. Larger microspheres with irregular shapes
were obtained from P(HB-HV) of M̅w = 450 kg mol–1 and 2.0% w/v PVA, whereas the microspheres
resulting from the mixture of higher M̅w P(HB-HV) with 3.0% w/v PVA were smaller, with narrower size
distribution and more uniform shapes.

Figure 3 SEM images of 1.0% w/v P(HB-HV) microspheres
with 2.0% w/v PVA,
300 rpm: (A) M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 130
kg mol–1 and (B) its size distribution; (C) M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 450 kg mol–1 and (D) its size distribution. Microspheres with 3% w/v PVA, 300
rpm: (E) M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 130 kg
mol–1 and (F) its size distribution; (G) M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 450 kg mol–1 and (H) its size distribution.

From Figure 3 it
can be observed that the increase of PVA content from 2.0 to 3.0%
w/v caused some changes in the average particle diameters or resulted
in a sharper size distribution. When the PVA content increase is evaluated
in the samples of M̅w(P(HB-HV))
= 130 kg mol–1 (images in Figure 3A,E), the particle size distribution became
sharper, with the size of particles of 3–8 μm; when using
the PVA content of 3% (Figure 3B,F), no particles with diameter higher than 21 μm were
observed, whereas in samples containing 2% of PVA, the size distribution
is wider and particles of 22–30 μm were found. In samples
prepared with M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 450
kg mol–1, the effect is more pronounced. The size
distribution is sharper when the content of PVA is 3% and they presented
diameter from >1000 to 11 μm (Figure 3H), whereas samples prepared with 2% of PVA
presented diameters in the range of 2–31 μm (Figure 3D). Yet, particle
sizes are concentrated in diameters less than 5 μm (Figure 3H) in samples containing
3% of PVA, whereas microspheres of >1000 nm to 2 μm were
not
found in samples using 2% of PVA, which presented particle sizes concentrated
in diameters of 10–15 μm (Figure 3D). Moreover, it affected the shape and homogeneity
of the obtained microspheres: when the PVA content is increased to
3.0% w/v, smaller and regular microspheres were obtained.

With
respect to the effect of employing distinct encapsulation
stirring rate regimes to particle size, in their work, Martin et al.65 showed that rough and larger PHB microparticles
were produced at a low stirring rate regime, whereas at a high stirring
rate regime, smaller, but rougher and wrinkled, microparticles were
produced. They related this roughness to PHB polymer crystallinity,
as, in their samples, even the obtained microparticles presented certain
degree of crystallinity. As showed in earlier studies,66−69 the P(HB-HV) copolymer is semicrystalline and, therefore, it is
susceptible to phase separation and its unstable crystals may melt
upon heating.70 Our results, as showed
by X-ray diffraction presented in Figure 1, also evidenced some degree of crystallinity
of the starting polymer, which led to semicrystalline P(HB-HV) microparticles,
when both polymers with distinct molar masses were used in the formulation.
Distinct crystallinity, as will be further discussed, influences the
microsphere surface characteristics and properties.

The role
of encapsulation stirring rates on particle size distribution
was evaluated. As shown in Figures 4 and 5, higher stirring rates
produced smaller droplets and promoted disruption of larger droplets
during solution emulsification, which led to smaller particles of
narrow size distribution (Figure 5B,D). Nevertheless, the smallest microparticles (in
the range of >1000 nm to 5 μm) were obtained at lower stirring
rates. In these conditions, they were produced in an expressive amount,
being 15% in samples produced with Py and more than 44% in samples
produced with C6 (Figure 4B,D).

w/v PVA, M̅w(P(HB-HV)) = 130 kg
mol–1: (A) with C6, produced via protocol 2, stirred
at 300 rpm (B) and
its size distribution; (C) with Py, produced via protocol 5, stirred
at 300 rpm and (D) its size distribution. Bars correspond to 100 μm.

Figure 5 SEM images of 1.0% w/v P(HB-HV) microspheres
with 2.0% w/v PVA, M̅w(P(HB-HV))
= 130 kg mol–1: (A) containing C6, produced via
protocol 2, stirred at 900 rpm
and (B) its size distribution; (C) containing Py, produced via protocol
8, stirred at 900 rpm and (D) its size distribution. Bars correspond
to 100 μm.

The role of the fluorescent
dyes (C6 and Py), at a concentration
of approximately 200 μg mL–1 in formulations,
on the particle size and size distribution was studied in protocols
using 1.0% w/v P(HB-HV) and 2.0% w/v PVA. As observed by comparing Figures 2A–D to 3E–H, there is a remarkable decrease in size
and size distribution when the PVA content is increased from 1.0 to
3.0% w/v, but there is an important size variation when coumarin-6
or pyrene is added to the formulation, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. Microparticles were, initially, smaller upon Py addition, as Figures 3, 5, and 6 show, with nanospheres of 150–180
nm (Figure 6) being
formed. Nevertheless, these nanoparticles coalesce to give a wider
size distribution than that observed for C6. Although, in these conditions,
samples produced with C6 did not present any nanospheres, particles
presented smaller sizes, ranging from 2 to 16 μm, presenting
more than 30% of particles of 6 μm, whereas for samples prepared
with Py as an additive, the size distribution is in the range from
2 to 20 μm, with 25% of particles of 6 μm and 0.5% of
particles presenting diameters of 25 μm (Figure 5D). This is evidence of the average particle
size reduction because of the fluorophore-specific interactions with
the particle constituents. In fact, as the P(HB-HV) microsphere surface
is polar, it may present stronger interactions with C6 than with Py,
leading to the observed smaller particles with Py. It is expected
that, with the polar C6, P(HB-HV) particles interact specially via
electrostatic interactions, which are strong interaction forces, or
through Debye forces, as C6 is a permanent dipole. With Py, van der
Waals interactions are expected, especially London dispersion forces
are also expected, as this compound can present an instantaneous induced
dipole in such systems.71

Figure 6 SEM images registered
for P(HB-HV) nanospheres at the Py-loaded
microsphere surface.

As showed by Maia et al.,10 P(HB-HV)
microspheres are also obtained in preparations in the absence of encapsulating
compounds. Furthermore, Muramaki et al.72 showed that highly hydrolyzed PVA, when used as an emulsion stabilizer,
led to local gelatinization of the emulsion droplet surfaces and enabled
nanoparticle aggregation, resulting in larger particles. In this work,
P(HB-HV) nanospheres (150–180 nm) were observed as microspheres’
precursors in the presence of Py (Figures 4 and 6). In fact,
the emulsion stabilizer PVA used in the solvent evaporation method
for microparticle preparation tends to bind to the produced microparticles,
affecting some properties of the microsphere, such as its hydrophobicity
and degradation parameters, and therefore its erosion rate. Also,
the PVA content per weight of the microparticle is expected to change
as the particle size decreases because of the specific surface area
increase in smaller microparticles.73−75 PVA binds irreversibly
to polymer microparticles, causing a PVA surface density increase
as the microparticle size decreases. Nevertheless, this effect is
independent of the residual PVA concentration,73 being virtually the same at the concentration studied (from
0.1 to 10% w/v). In fact, Mu et al.73 stated
that PVA recovers the nanoparticle surface and forms an interconnected
network with the polymer at the interface, which hinders its removal
after emulsification. This effect herein is referred to as PVA gelatinization.

The effect observed in our work suggests that the nonpolar fluorophore
(Py) inhibits surface stabilization by means of repulsion forces.
As Py-loaded microspheres are expected to present weaker probe–microsphere–surfactant
interaction than those containing C6, the amount of residual PVA is
smaller (Table 1).
Consequently, surface charge is expected to change and nanometric
droplets are formed and initially stabilized, but further aggregation
cannot be avoided. Pyrene sorption on the surface of the inner nanometric
particles prevented the hydrophilic PVA molecules to coalesce; nevertheless,
Py repulsion forces were overcome by hydrophobic forces among P(HB-HV)
chains, which enabled droplet aggregation, resulting in nanoparticles
coalescence. It suggests that the Py and C6 polarity characteristics
changed the surface nanoparticle properties, but in different ways.
In fact, nanoparticles based on PHB and its derivatives are only reported
in composite preparation.76−80

Table 1 also presented
the residual PVA contents in all preparations. The reason for the
higher PVA residual content when C6 is used, compared to the residual
PVA in Py-containing formulations, is related to the nature and magnitude
of interactions between the carbonyl groups on C6 lactone and the
hydroxyl groups of the residual PVA sorbed on the P(HB-HV) surface.
Py does not present such an evident influence on the amount of residual
PVA, even when changes in the experimental protocol were implemented,
whereas samples containing C6 were sensible to protocol changes and
resulted in distinct residual PVA contents, which evidences a remarkable
change in surface properties.

The obtained values of ζ-potential
presented in Table 1 lead to the conclusion
that the greater the probe–polymer interaction, the greater
is the PVA deposition and infeasibility of forming nanoparticles (because
of the balance of fluorophore nature and polymer hydrophobicity),
but higher particle stabilization levels were reached, smaller microparticles
were obtained, and the surface charge was enhanced. However, dipolar
and hydrogen-bonding interactions between the carbonyl and amino groups
of C6 and the carbonyl groups of P(HB-HV) are more effective than
the induced dipole–dipole interactions between P(HB-HV) and
Py. Once again, the fluorophore characteristics were determinants
in the microsphere formation, evidenced by the capture and encapsulation
efficiencies. The decrease of the total surface charge because of
weaker hydrophobic interactions between the copolymer and Py facilitates
interparticle attraction and surface adherence, enabling the nanospheres
to coalesce and give rise to large sphere-like particles.

2.2 Microsphere Surface Properties
From
the SEM images presented in Figures 3–5, it is evident that
surface roughness is modulated by the additive contents and chain
lengths of P(HB-HV) copolymers. From these images, longer P(HB-HV)
chains lead to rougher surfaces, fluorophore-containing microspheres
are smoother than the microspheres without fluorophores, and those
formed upon protocols with less PVA content are rougher than those
formed upon higher PVA contents in the formulation. To infer on the
particle surface morphology and the reasons of such diversity, chemical
analyses of the residual PVA and C6 or Py sorbed on the particles’
surface were performed. PVA polymeric chains present a hydrophilic
portion with a higher volume than the hydrophobic portion; therefore,
it is expected that they would be able to form very stable oil/water
emulsions, as micelles are formed. It leads to the assumption of a
denser coverage of the hydrophobic portion of several PVA molecules,
forming droplets with increased superficial density until reaching
the point of saturation, at the size limit of the drops, which generates
a residual content of the surfactant.73,81 Partially
hydrolyzed PVA (around 70%) presents more hydrophilic portions than
a highly hydrolyzed one, such that used in this work. Nevertheless,
at lower degrees of hydrolysis, the polymer solubility is highly affected,
limiting its use as a stabilizer. Along with the superficial density,
the so-called “blockiness”82−84 of the PVA
hydrophobic portion influences its emulsifying ability. Although partially
hydrolyzed PVAs are excellent stabilizers for aqueous and flat systems,
PVAs with higher degrees of hydrolysis are very efficient to stabilize
oil/water emulsions,76 such that employed
here and also by Tian et al.85 This surfactant
residue can be determined by UV/vis absorption, once it can form complexes
with in situ generated iodine and the absorbance variation is measured
at 690 nm; the complexes are with the maximum absorption wavelength.
It was found that the residual PVA content depends on the presence
of the fluorophores. In these terms, the residual PVA content in the
control sample of 2.0% w/v PVA + 1.0% w/v P(HB-HV) 130 kg mol–1 was 3.5%. Table 1 shows the residual PVA contents of all samples. C6-containing
microspheres showed the highest residual PVA content of 9.3% w/w,
on average, which is almost twice the content found for Py-containing
microspheres (4.7% w/w, on average). In addition, the ζ-potential
data showed that particle surfaces containing C6 are more negative
than the particles with no fluorophore added, and those containing
Py are the less negative particles. Data are shown in Table 1.

Microspheres obtained
in this work presented rougher surface and smaller structures as the
encapsulation stirring rate is increased. Nevertheless, our findings
show that the surfactant content is a determinant to microsphere size
control and plays an important role in the surface roughness. This
was also found by Maia et al.10 In addition,
Panith et al.11 showed that an increase
in the HV content in the P(HB-HV) polymer leads to more spherical
particles with smoother and less porous surface morphology. This is
attributed to the lower crystallinity of the copolymer compared to
the PHB homopolymer microspheres. In this work, the HV % is very low,
being higher in P(HB-HV) of Mw = 130 kg
mol–1, which is 2.7% for this copolymer, and yet
it seems to influence the dispersion of the organic phase in the aqueous
media, acting as a surfactant, as mentioned before. From Figure 3, on the other hand,
P(HB-HV) of Mw = 450 kg mol–1, with less HV % (0.7%), produced a highly rough and porous surface,
which evidenced the effect as being due to the polymer chain lengths
than due to HV %, at such low contents.

The surfactant PVA also
acted as a cryoprotector during the lyophilization
process in the substitution of trehalose and as an agglutination preventive,
as it prevents the freeze-drying powdered microsphere aggregation,
which is expected to occur with no trehalose addition to the mixture.86 Initially, the sample is immersed in N2(liquid), at 77 K, to eliminate water in excess through sublimation of the
small ice crystals formed at this step. Then, the maximum drying temperature
must be kept below the microsphere glass transition temperature (Tg) to avoid fusion and agglutination. As PVA Tg (approx. 350 K) is higher than P(HB-HV) Tg (approx. 273 K), during lyophilization at
283 K, the surfactant remained in its glassy state, whereas the P(HB-HV)
microspheres became fluid, which maintained the particles apart and
stable, avoiding aggregation. After redispersion, the particles showed
the same physical characteristics with and without trehalose,87 which showed that trehalose is dispensable to
the proposed formulations.

2.3 C6 and Py Encapsulation
Efficiencies
The lyophilized microspheres were analyzed with
respect to three
encapsulation aspects: (1) recovered percentage (% rec) upon lyophilization,
(2) fluorophore capture efficiency (% ads), and (3) fluorophore encapsulation
efficiency (% EE). They were determined by eqs 1–3, described
in the Experimental Section. The calculated
efficiencies are presented in Table 2.

Table 2 Microsphere Properties of 1.0% w/v
P(HB-HV) 130 kg mol–1 + 2.0% w/v PVA with C6 and
Py: Recovered Percentage, % rec (Eq 1), Fluorophore Capture Efficiency, % ads (Eq 2), Fluorophore Encapsulation Efficiency,
% EE (Eq 3)
sample	formulations	% rec	% ads	% EE	
2	+C6 (300 rpm)	61	14	96	
3	+C6 (900 rpm)	54	14	98	
4	+C6 + trehalose (300 rpm)	65	8	100

6	+Py (900 rpm)	52	3	19	
7	+Py + trehalose (300 rpm)	57	2	17	
As Py weakly interacts with
PVA and P(HB-HV) polymers, microspheres
produced in the presence of this fluorophore are expected to present
a reduced capture efficiency and, indeed, it was four to eight times
less effective than the capture efficiency determined for samples
containing C6 (Table 2), even though P(HB-HV) conversion into microspheres, in the presence
of any of these fluorophores, occurred at the same proportion (approximately
60%, see Table 2).

2.4 Fluorescence Confocal Laser Microscopy
Figures 7 and 8 present fluorescence confocal laser micrographs
registered for microspheres containing C6 or Py. They show distinct
fluorescent regions along the equatorial exploitation of the samples,
which evidenced the presence of C6 and Py inside the microspheres,
as expected, because of fluorophore encapsulation. Notably, fluorophores
are distinctly distributed in the copolymer matrix.

microspheres containing C6. (A) At the
surface section of a selected microsphere and (B) at its center section.
Inner scales are micrometers.

Figure 8 FCLSM images of P(HB-HV) microspheres containing Py. (A) At the
surface section of a selected microsphere and (B) at its center section.
Inner scales are micrometers.

Figure 7 shows
equatorially
cut micrographs of C6-containing microspheres at the center section
and at the surface of the microsphere. Distinct colors are due to
the distinct moieties emitting at the surface and at the interior
of the particles. Image in Figure 7A shows fluorescence predominantly green, which corresponds
to emission at the range of 522–535 nm (fluorescence spectra
were not shown), which are due to the presence of C6 monomers preferably
located at the outermost layers of the microsphere. Figure 7B, however, presents a predominantly
yellow-red fluorescence, at the range of 580–632 nm, which
is due to the C6 aggregates located at the inner section of the microsphere.
The red-shift effect of the fluorescence spectra occurs when fluorophores
interact to emit from the relaxed excited states, and this is the
effect frequently caused by aggregation. This aggregation occurs more
efficiently in the interior of the microsphere because the fluorophore
moieties are closer to each other, resulting in effective interactions
and revealing that a considerable amount of fluorophore was encapsulated.

In Figure 8, Py-containing
microspheres showed a distinct distribution compared to the C6-containing
ones. Figure 8A presents
a microsphere with fluorescence predominantly green, which indicates
greater amounts of Py in the regions closer to the surface as aggregates
(excimer fluorescence in the green region, between 522 and 535 nm;
fluorescence spectra not shown). From Figure 8B, which corresponds to the image taken from
the equatorial section at the center of the microsphere, it is possible
to observe “dark” sites inside the microsphere, attributed
to the absence of fluorophore or to the fluorescence typically emitted
by the monomers of Py, at the UV region, between 372 and 394 nm (similar
to the spectra shown in Figure 11).

2.5 Controlled Release Kinetics
By steady-state
fluorescence spectroscopy, the kinetics of fluorophore release from
the microspheres were determined. In Figure 9 are presented fluorescence spectra recorded
for microspheres produced via protocols 2 and 3, that is, containing
C6, as a function of time. The spectral characteristics of C6 are
obtained, and it is observed that their intensity increase with time.

Figure 9 Steady-state
fluorescence spectra recorded for microspheres containing
C6, formed with 2% m/v of PVA + 1% m/v of P(HB-HV) + coumarin-6: (A)
300 rpm, seven washing cycles and (B) 900 rpm, seven washing cycles.

Fluorescence intensity of C6 over
time was used to determine the
concentration of free C6 ([C6]free) in the solution (Figure 10A), which informs
about the release rate. [C6]free is lower in microspheres
produced via protocol 2 (Table 1) and, to avoid deviations, the release rate is determined
in a plot of percentage of released C6 (% C6) over time, which is
presented in Figure 10B.

Figure 10 Curves of (A) [C6]free vs time; (B) % of free C6 vs
time for microspheres produced via protocols 2 (●) and 3 (■);
(C) [Py]free vs time and (D) % of free Py vs time for microspheres
produced via protocols 5 (●) and 6 (■).

Steady-state fluorescence spectra recorded for
microspheres containing
pyrene, prepared via distinct protocols (5 and 6, Table 1), are presented in Figure 11. They show the characteristic fluorescence of pyrene, and
there is no evidence of excimers or dimers in these samples.

Figure 11 Steady-state
fluorescence spectra recorded for microspheres containing
Py, formed with 2% m/v of PVA + 1% m/v of P(HB-HV) + pyrene: (A) 300
rpm, seven washing cycles and (B) 900 rpm, seven washing cycles.

As pyrene is well-known as a polarity-sensitive
compound, the intensity
ratio of vibronic peaks in the fluorescence spectra at 374 nm and
at 394 nm (I374/I394) was determined over time, for both preparations. The results
are presented in Table S2 in the Supporting Information.

The intensity change of fluorescence over time was also used
to
determine the concentration of pyrene that is released ([Py]free), and the plots of [Py]free versus time and percentage
of pyrene (% Py) released over time are presented in Figure 10C,D.

This above-mentioned
polarity sensitivity of pyrene is characterized
by changes in the fluorescence spectra, and it is due to the self-absorption
effect that is stronger in nonpolar environments, leading to a reduced
relative intensity of fluorescence peaks (I374/I394). By analyzing I374/I394 values, obtained
for the pyrene fluorescence spectra recorded at distinct times, during
the controlled release determination, from the microspheres produced
by both protocols 5 and 6, it is evident that pyrene is in a polar
environment in both samples; nevertheless, it shows that the local
polarity of microspheres produced via protocol 6 is slightly higher
than that of the microspheres produced via protocol 5. It can be related
to an effect of the PVA moieties, which are hydrophilic and maybe
distinctly spread over microspheres produced at stirring rates imposed
to each protocol. Also, as showed by Sahoo et al.,88 it can form a hydrogel over the microspheres, generating
a diffusional barrier to the release of both pyrene and coumarin-6,
which could lead to a distinct release of fluorophores in microspheres
produced by the adopted stirring rates. In fact, for an oil-in-water
emulsion, Py is the dominant component in lowering surface tension
in the initial nanoparticles and, therefore, accumulates at the oil–water
interface.89

Regarding the controlled
release kinetics of fluorophores, Figure 10 showed that samples
produced with both fluorophores, in both stirring conditions, present
a fast initial release phase, with a release of approximately 60%
of the fluorophores at the first 100 min. This effect is independent
of the identity of the fluorophore, but it is faster for those samples
that resulted in microspheres of smaller size distributions, such
as those prepared via protocols 3 and 6 (Table 1). This may be because of a higher superficial
area in these samples and of the release of fluorophores that are
not in the interior of the microspheres. Nevertheless, from 100 min,
there are differences in the release rates. Samples containing pyrene
present virtually the same release kinetics, whereas for samples containing
C6, the release from the smaller microspheres (those prepared via
protocol 3) is faster than the release from larger microspheres. This
distinct behavior between the microspheres of Py and C6 may be because
of the differences in polarity of these fluorophores and, thus, of
the distinct interaction nature between the fluorophore and polymeric
matrices. As pyrene is a nonpolar compound, it weakly interacts with
the polymeric chains, whereas C6 interacts with them by strong electrostatic
interactions and hydrogen bonds. In all cases, all encapsulated fluorophores
are released at times of approximately 450 min; the initial release
occurred by diffusional mechanisms, followed by an erosion of the
microspheres that lad to the fluorophore release.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we showed that, although the use
of fluorophores
in the P(PH-HV) microsphere production does not significantly influence
their morphological characteristics, fluorophore characteristics presented
a role in particle properties assignment, including size, size distribution,
surface charge, and entrapment efficiency. By comparing the microspheres
produced under distinct conditions, such as polymer molar mass, stirring
rates, and surfactant and fluorophore contents, it was clear that
the P(HB-HV) molar mass exerted a high influence on the size and surface
morphology. Fluorophore capture and fluorophore encapsulation efficiencies
were modulated by the interaction balance between P(HB-HV) and fluorophores,
showing stronger effects in C6-containing microspheres than in Py-containing
ones.

The final sizes of microspheres are driven by the PVA
concentration
because of its ability to avoid coalescence of the droplets formed
during stirring. As nanospheres were observed in this work, in samples
produced with the fluorophore Py, and as they are expected to give
rise to microspheres, it is evidences that PVA gelatinization onto
nanosphere surfaces influenced the balance between the aggregation
forces of polymeric chains and the repulsion forces exerted by the
Py molecules. It evidences that the nonpolar Py avoids gelatinization
in the first-obtained nanoparticles by repulsion forces, but, at some
point, polymeric aggregation is strong enough to enable microsphere
formation. C6-specific interactions with P(HB-HV) and PVA moieties
are stronger than those with Py and contribute to gelatinization in
first cores, inhibiting nanoparticle formation. Also, residual PVA
in the particle surface avoided the aggregation of the microparticles.
Such results showed that trehalose was dispensable in the formulation
as a cryoprotector during lyophilization, and PVA acts also as an
efficient cryoprotector.

By FCLSM, it was shown that C6 is distributed
throughout the inner
core of the microparticle, whereas Py was concentrated at its surface.

The controlled release kinetics of both fluorophores presented
a similar initial phase driven by diffusion, which is independent
of fluorophore identity, but determined by the microsphere size distribution.
Further release phases are strictly dependent on the fluorophore properties
and the nature of their interaction with the P(HB-HV) and PVA moieties,
which are highly hydrophilic and can distinctly influence the diffusion
of C6 and Py. Nevertheless, the total release of both fluorophores
was reached at a similar time, of approximately 450 min.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Microsphere Preparation
Poly(hydroxybutyrate-co-hydroxyvalerate) [P(HB-HV)] M̅w = 130 kg mol–1 (96.9%
PHB/2.70% PHV)
and 450 kg mol–1 (98.8% PHB/0.70% PHV) were purchased
from Usina da Pedra—Irmãos Biagi S.A. (Brazil). PVA
(M̅w = 124–186 kg mol–1, 98–99% hydrolyzed) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.
Chloroform P.A. was purchased from Tedia (Brazil) and was previously
purified. Coumarin-6 (C6) 99% and pyrene (Py) 99% were supplied by
Sigma-Aldrich. Their chemical structures are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Microspheres
containing fluorophores C6 or Py and microspheres without fluorophores
were prepared by distinct protocols that used distinct quantities
of P(HB-HV) copolymer, PVA, in the presence and absence of trehalose.
They consisted of the dissolution of an amount (1.0% w/v) of the P(HB-HV)
copolymer in a 0.1% w/v C6 or Py chloroform solution, at room temperature
(298 K). A 30 mL of this resulting solution was added to 120 mL of
1.0, 2.0, or 3.0% w/v PVA aqueous solution. The obtained emulsion
was homogenized by mechanical stirring at 300 rpm or 900 rpm, continuously,
for 24 h, in an open flask to enable solvent evaporation. The microspheres
were then centrifuged in a Beckman centrifuge J2-21 at 10 000
rpm and washed twice with deionized water, freeze-dried in a Thermo
Savant MicroModulyo-115 lyophilizer, and stored in vacuum desiccators
at room temperature (298 K). Other protocols consisted of the addition
of 180 mg of trehalose as a cryoprotector after emulsion preparation,
in the proportion of 0.12% w/v.

The amounts of C6 and Py incorporated
in the microspheres were
determined by UV/vis absorption spectroscopy in a HP 8453 diode array
spectrophotometer. For this determination, the fluorescent molecules
were desorbed from the microspheres, powdering 5 mg of the produced
microspheres, and dispersing this powder in 10 mL of chloroform under
stirring for 20 min to dissolve the polymer and to extract the fluorophore.
A 200 μL of this supernatant containing C6 or Py was diluted
in 2.5 mL of purified chloroform. Its concentration was determined
by applying the obtained absorbance data to a calibration curve constructed
in the fluorophore concentration range from 1.0 × 10–5 to 1.0 × 10–6 mol L–1,
at wavelengths of 446 and 338 nm, which are the maximum absorption
wavelengths for C6 and Py, respectively. On the basis of these data,
the recovered percentage (% rec), the fluorophore capture efficiency
(% ads), and the fluorophore encapsulation efficiency (% EE)90 were calculated, as follows 1   2   3  where CC6,Py is
the C6 or Py concentration in chloroform after microsphere extraction; Vi is the chloroform volume
used in microsphere dissolution; ml is
the lyophilized microsphere mass; mp is
the initial polymer mass; mf is the fluorophore
mass; mf,l is the fluorophore mass into
lyophilized microspheres; mm is the microsphere
mass used in the analysis; mf is the C6
or Py mass, mp is the P(HB-HV) mass, mPVA,Tls is the PVA or trehalose mass used in
the microsphere preparation.

Because of the experimental evidence
that smaller particles with
sharper size distribution are obtained when using the PVA content
of 2.0% w/v in microspheres without fluorophores or containing fluorophores,
this PVA concentration was selected to be employed at all further
protocols of formulations. These variables of composition were elected
according to a25 degrees of freedom factorial planning
of the experiments, as summarized in Table S1. The variables of the adopted procedure were the presence or absence
of a fluorophore (C6 or Py), which is variable 1, the presence represented
by a (+) signal and absence by a (−) signal; variable 2 being
P(HB-HV) of M̅w = 130 kg mol–1, represented by a (−) signal or P(HB-HV) M̅w = 450 kg mol–1, represented
by a (+) signal; variable 3 being the double quantity of PVA, represented
by (−) or triple quantity of PVA, represented by (+); variable
4 being the presence (+) or absence (−) of trehalose as a cryoprotector;
and variable 5 being the stirring rate with 300 rpm represented by
(−) signal and 900 rpm represented by (+). It is noteworthy
that, as two distinct fluorophores were used in these protocols, the
total number of experiments performed for procedure optimization was
48. They were performed as indicated in Table S1. The quantity of PVA was varied because the PVA used was
98–99% hydrolyzed, which is a highly hydrolyzed emulsifier
and its effect on the P(HB-HV) particle formation should be characterized.

The results for all the samples produced according to Table S1 were compared to those obtained by the
procedure employing 1% of PVA content to understand the benefits of
changing the PVA content as well as the effects of using a fluorophore
to monitor the particles formed and to be encapsulated as models for
drugs with distinct hydrophilicity.

4.2 Particle
Characterization
The morphologies
and physical–chemical properties of the obtained microspheres
were characterized, and the experimental details are presented as
follows.

4.2.1 SEM Images
The morphology and particle
size distribution of lyophilized microspheres were examined by a JEOL
JSM-6360-LV scanning electron microscope, operating in the secondary
electron image mode with an accelerated voltage of 5 keV. The microspheres
were placed in a copper sample holder and metallization was carried
out in a Bal-Tec MED 020 sputtering chamber. Magnifications are presented
in the respective images.

The diameter of the dried particles
was SEM image-analyzed, employing Image Tool 3.0 software,91 counting 350–600 particles per image.
The dimensions of each microsphere were evaluated after a calibration,
and each value was statistically treated, determining the average
diameter (d̅), the standard deviation (σ),
and variation coefficient (VC, %). A system is considered monodisperse
if VC is less than 10%. Data are presented in Table 1.

4.2.2 Zeta Potentials
The ζ-potentials
of the microspheres were determined by electrophoresis of the deionized
water suspended particles, after sonication for 5 min, using a ZetaPals
Brookhaven, Inst. Corp. apparatus. An acrylic cell was used and inserted
with its integral gold electrodes close to the lid.

4.2.3 PVA Residual Content Determination
Microsphere residual
PVA contents were determined by the UV/vis absorbance
spectra of their complexes with iodine moieties. Complex formation
between the alcohol end groups of hydrolyzed PVA and iodine was performed
by treating 2 mg of microspheres with 2 mL of 2 mol L–1 aqueous NaOH solution for 30 min, at 373 K. Then, the sample was
neutralized by adding 1 mL of 4 mol L–1 aqueous
HCl solution. Then, 3 mL of 0.65 mol L–1 boric acid,
1.5 mL of deionized water, and 0.5 mL of I2/KI (0.05 mol
L–1/0.15 mol L–1) were added to
the solutions. The absorbance of each sample was measured at λ
= 690 nm after 15 min incubation in the dark. The residual PVA contents
were determined in a calibration curve of PVA submitted to the same
reaction conditions.92

4.2.4 FCLSM Images
FCLSM was performed
using a Karl Zeiss inverted microscope model MRC 1024 UV, equipped
with an argon–krypton laser, an acquisition and analysis system,
and a Focus Graphics photographic system. Resuspended microspheres
in deionized water were excited at 476, 488, 568, and 647 nm.

4.3 Fluorophore Controlled Release Kinetics
The controlled release kinetics of coumarin-6 (C6) and pyrene (Py)
encapsulated in microspheres produced by protocols 2, 3, 5, and 6
(see Table 1) were
determined by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy in an ISS-PC1
spectrophotometer. The samples were placed in a 1 cm optical path
quartz cuvette. Microspheres were suspended in a phosphate buffer
at pH = 7.4 and Pluronic F-65% m/v, at 310 K, with the spectra recorded
at intervals of 30 min for 12 h.
