A facile method has been developed
for the rapid and efficient
enrichment of DNAs from different media including synthetic single-strand
DNAs (ssDNAs) from buffer solutions and cell-free DNAs (cfDNAs) from
blood plasma through electric field-driven adsorption and desorption
of DNAs by a polyacrylamide/phytic acid/polydopamine (PAAM/PA/PDA)
hydrogel. The as-prepared PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel possesses regular porosity
with a large surface area, strong electric field responsiveness/good
conductivity, and a rich aromatic structure, which can be used as
an ideal adsorbent for DNA enrichment under a positive electric field.
The enriched DNAs can be released efficiently when the positive electric
field is converted to a negative electric field. The PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel-based
electrochemical method enables the completion of the process of DNA
adsorption and release within 5 min and exhibits reasonable enrichment
efficiencies and recovery rates of various DNAs. For instance, the
high enrichment sensitivity (0.1 pmol L–1) together
with the excellent recovery (>75%) of an ssDNA with 78 nucleotides
is obtained. Combined with the PCR amplification technique, the practicability
of the as-proposed method is demonstrated by the screening of circulating
tumor DNAs (ctDNAs) with a BRAFV600E mutation in cfDNAs
from the blood plasma samples of patients with papillary thyroid cancer
or thyroid nodule and random patients from a clinical laboratory.

==== Body
Introduction
The ability to analyze
and explore circulating tumor biomarkers
in peripheral blood is highly desirable for early cancer diagnosis,
progression prediction, therapeutic strategy establishment, and prognosis
evaluation.1−13 Among them, circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNAs) are tumor-derived cell-free
DNAs (cfDNAs) in blood plasma, which possess the hallmark genomic
characteristics of a tumor.1−5,7−11 Therefore, the ctDNA-based liquid biopsy in the blood
draw form has attracted great attention because the method offers
the possibility of minimizing invasiveness to characterize the genetic
information on the tumor and monitor the progression of cancer through
real-time dynamic monitoring. Although ctDNA has great potential to
become a liquid biopsy substitute for tissue biopsies to monitor genetic
and epigenetic alterations of carcinogenesis, it is a challenge to
directly detect the mutated ctDNAs in the blood sample of cancer patients
because the concentration of ctDNA is too low to be extracted and
purified by conventional methods for separation and enrichment of
genomic DNA.1,3,8,9,13 Due to the
extremely trace amount and highly fragmented nature (<200 bp) of
ctDNA in blood plasma, there is an urgent demand for the development
of a new technique that can enrich short DNA fragments in different
media to satisfy the requirement of further clinical applications.
Recently, a few strategies including nanoparticle-coupling approach,
electrochemical sensing chip, and counter electrophoresis-based assay
have been established for isolation and analysis of ctDNA.8,9,13−28 In particular, electrochemical methods exhibit high attraction for
ctDNA detection/enrichment because they are rapid, convenient, low-cost,
and highly sensitive.21−28

Conductive polymers have been extensively adopted in electrochemical
platforms for bioanalytical and biomedical applications.21,29−34 For instance, Cho and colleagues have constructed a polypyrrole
(Ppy) electrochemical chip for electric field-mediated extraction
of cfDNAs from the blood plasma samples of lung cancer patients.21 Polyacrylamide (PAAM) is a kind of material
used in gel electrophoresis to separate biomolecules including nucleic
acids. Polydopamine (PDA) has been demonstrated as a good DNA carrier
under physiological conditions, which can efficiently adsorb DNA on
its surface and inhibit nuclease digestion of the absorbed DNA.35−40 Using phytic acid (PA) as a cross-linker, we have synthesized a
kind of PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel under mild ambient conditions, which
has a three-dimensional (3D) network nanostructure, excellent physicochemical
stability, and good conductivity.41,42 Especially,
the highly 3D porous nanostructure of the PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel provides
a large active surface area for adsorption of ions and molecules.

As a member of the rapidly accelerated fibrosarcoma (RAF) family
of kinases, BRAF is the most potent activator of the MAP/ERK kinase
(MEK), which regulates the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway.43−51 Various mutations of the BRAF gene (>40) have been identified
in
approximately 7% of all human cancers. More than 90% of the oncogenic
mutation in the BRAF gene involves a thymidine (T) to adenosine (A)
transversion at nucleotide 1799 of exon 15. The mutation is known
as BRAFV600E due to the substitution of valine (V) with
glutamic acid (E) at amino acid residue 600. The missense BRAFV600E mutation leads to the upregulation of the MAPK/ERK activities
in tumor cells significantly. Three prevalent cancer types, such as
melanoma, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and colorectal cancer (CRC),
have been shown to have a high incidence of BRAFV600E mutation.44−51 Therefore, the BRAFV600E mutation is an attractive target
for the diagnosis and therapy of cancers.

Herein, we introduce
a PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel-based electrochemical
method for efficient DNA enrichment through electric field-mediated
adsorption/desorption of DNA on a PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel-modified glassy
carbon electrode (GCE). The integration of the 3D porous PAAM/PA/PDA
hydrogel and the electric potential regulation endows the method with
great enhanced enrichment efficiencies and recovery rates of various
DNAs. The mutational status of BRAFV600E in PTC patients
was successfully addressed when the enriched ctDNAs from as low as
20 μL of blood plasma were used as a template for PCR amplification,
which demonstrated the clinical relevance of the PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel-based
electrochemical method.

Results and Discussion
Experimental Condition
Optimization of DNA Enrichment
As displayed in Scheme 1, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA was fabricated
by the in situ gelation reaction
of AAM, PA, and DA on the GCE surface using KPS as the initiator and
TEMED as the accelerator. The DNAs in different media were adsorbed
on the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA through electrostatic attraction while a positive
electrode potential (e.g., 1.0 V) was applied. The adsorbed DNAs were
then released into the solution through electrostatic exclusion while
a negative electrode potential (e.g., −1.0 V) was applied.
The DNA adsorption–releasing process can be measured by the
electron transfer resistance change of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA (i.e.,
ΔRet and/or ΔR′et) because DNAs can obstruct electron exchange
on the electrode surface.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of the Electric
Field-Driven Strategy for
Enriching DNAs from Different Media by the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
The illustration is not drawn
to scale.

In order to obtain optimized DNA
enrichment conditions, the effect
of the PDA amount in the PAAM/PA/PDA on the DNA enrichment was first
investigated because the PDA can not only affect the 3D porous nanostructure
of the PAAM/PA/PDA41 but also interact
with the DNAs through π–π interactions.35−40 In this case, a synthetic ssDNA (TM) with 78 NTs from
the known oncogene, BRAFV600E, was used as the DNA target.
As shown in Figure S1a, the ΔRet was increased by increasing the concentration
of dopamine (DA) in the reaction mixture from 3.5 to 6.5 mmol/L and
began to saturate above 6.5 mmol/L, while the concentration of TM was kept constant. Therefore, 6.5 mmol/L was used as the
optimized concentration of DA for fabricating GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA. Under
this condition, the surface of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA has a porous structure,
which can facilitate electron transport and enhance the DNA adsorption
capability (as shown in Figure S2). In
addition, the ΔRet also increased
with the increasing incubation time of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA with the
DNA-containing solution, electrode potential, and standing time of
the electrode potential, respectively, while the concentration of
TM remained unchanged (as shown in Figure S1b–d). The saturation values of ΔRet were obtained at 45 min (incubation time),
1.0 V (electrode potential), and 2 min (standing time). In the following
study, the DNA adsorption was carried out with the optimized condition,
that is, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA was firstly incubated in the DNA-containing
solution for 45 min and kept at 1.0 V for 2 min. During the DNA desorption,
the ΔR′et decreased with
the decreasing electrode potential and the increasing standing time
of the electrode potential (as shown in Figure S3). Considering the potential window of the GCE and the redox
of water, the DNAs were released from the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA/DNA at −1.0
V for 2 min.

Under the optimized experimental conditions, the
DNA recovery efficiency
was evaluated using TM- and/or TW (wild type
of TM)-spiked solutions. The recovered ssDNAs were measured
by a well-established DNA microarray-based RLS assay.52,53 The TM and/or TW standard solutions were employed
to calibrate the RLS assay response to the corresponding ssDNAs concentrations.
The recovery yield of the ssDNA (YssDNA) is calculated by the following equation: YssDNA = (C1V1)/ (C0V0) × 100%; herein, C0 and V0 are the concentration and volume of the original
ssDNA solution, while C1 and V1 are the concentration and volume of the recovered ssDNA
solution, respectively. The C1 was evaluated
from the calibration curve of the DNA microarray-based RLS assay (as
shown in Figures S4 and S5). As shown in Figure 1, the YssDNA slightly increased by increasing the concentration
of the ssDNA from 0.1 to 50 pmol/L. In particular, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
was sensitive enough to extract 0.1 pmol/L of ssDNA with a high YssDNA (>80% of the ssDNA in Tris buffer and
> 75% of the ssDNA in Tris buffer plus 10% (v/v) blood plasma),
suggesting
that the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA exhibits excellent recovery efficiencies
of the ssDNA in different matrixes. In addition, we investigated the
effect of the ssDNA strand length on the recovery efficiency of the
ssDNA. As shown in Figure 2, the YssDNA was gradually reduced
by changing the ssDNA strand length from 78 to 28 NTs. Nonetheless,
the data suggested that the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA can be used to enrich
the small fragmented DNA (i.e., 28 NTs) with a relatively high YssDNA (>55% of the ssDNA in Tris buffer and
>50% of the ssDNA in Tris buffer plus 10% (v/v) blood plasma).
Efficient
enrichment of the small fragmented DNA from blood plasma may offer
an enhanced opportunity for identifying tumor type-related DNA mutations
in bloodstreams because tumor-derived cfDNAs (i.e., ctDNAs) are normally
presented as highly fragmented forms. Taken together, the experimental
results demonstrate that the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA has great potential for
extraction of ctDNA in the clinical blood samples.

(YssDNA) as
a function of ssDNA concentration in ssDNA (TM or TW)-spiked (a) Tris buffer or (b) Tris buffer plus 10% (v/v)
blood plasma.

Figure 2 Recovery yield of ssDNA (YssDNA) as
a function of the ssDNA strand length. The ssDNAs were enriched from
0.1 pmol/L ssDNA-spiked Tris buffer (Tris) or Tris buffer plus 10%
(v/v) blood plasma (plasma).

To evaluate the batch variation, GCEs modified with the PAAM/PA/PDA
in three batches were used to enrich 1 nmol/L of ssDNA (Tw)-spiked solutions. The CV value of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA is calculated
as 7.74%, which shows that the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA has good reproducibility.
After 7 days of storage at room temperature, the stability was investigated
by the same assay, as shown in Figure S7, and the result indicated that the as-prepared GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA has
good stability. Furthermore, the actual electrode area of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
has been calculated by the peak area of it before and after gel modifying.
The actual electrode area can be calculated as 3.822 mm2 (Figure S8).

Enrichment of ctDNA from
Plasma Samples of Clinical Patients
For demonstrating its
clinical utility, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA was
employed to enrich the cfDNAs from blood plasma samples of PTC and
TN patients. A 73 bp-amplicon flanking the nucleotide 1799 of exon
15 (BRAFV600 site) fragments was produced by the PCR amplification,
while the enriched cfDNAs were used as templates. As shown in Figure 3a, the PCR products
of enriched cfDNAs showed gel bands located in parallel alignment
with a DNA ladder under 100 bp. Although cfDNAs were enriched from
the same volume of blood plasma, the amounts of PCR products showed
strongly individual dependence. The result indicates that the amount
of cfDNA in blood plasma varies from patient to patient. A set of
experiments were designed to determine the sensitivity of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA.
As a typical example, the PCR products of enriched cfDNAs from various
volumes of blood plasma were analyzed by gel electrophoresis (as shown
in Figure 3b). The
yield of the PCR gradually increased as the blood plasma concentration
decreased, reached a maximum at 20% (v/v) blood plasma, and then decreased
with the decreasing blood plasma concentration.

Figure 3 (a) Gel electrophoresis
of PCR products of enriched cfDNAs from
100% (v/v) blood plasma of PTC (lanes 1–5) and TN (lanes 6–10)
patients. Lane 0 shows 20–500 bp DNA markers. (b) Effect of
blood plasma volume on the yield of PCR product; lanes 1– 7
represent the templates enriched from 1 mL (100% (v/v)), 500 μL
(50% (v/v)), 200 μL (20% (v/v)), 100 μL (10% (v/v)), 50
μL (5% (v/v)), 20 μL (2% (v/v)), and 10 μL (1% (v/v))
of blood plasma, respectively. The blood plasma from patient 3 was
diluted by Tris buffer.

The phenomenon suggests
that other components of blood plasma (e.g.,
negative-charged proteins) may affect the enrichment of cfDNA. In
addition, the DNA fragments containing the BRAFV600 site
could be clearly observed at as low as 20 μL of blood plasma
in 980 μL of Tris buffer. This means that the detection of tumor-related
genetic aberrations can be achieved by using 100 μL of peripheral
blood, increasing its attractivity for dynamic monitoring at different
time points throughout the treatment regimen.

The levels of
BRAFV600E mutation in cfDNAs of patients
were analyzed by the Sanger sequencing method, which were further
compared with the BRAFV600E mutation statuses in genomic
DNAs of the correspondent tumor tissues. According to the facts that
the short BRAFV600E amplicon (73 bp) and the high accuracy
for the back in the middle of the Sanger sequencing method, reverse
sequencing was chosen to obtain accurate results (as shown in Figure 4). Currently, the
analysis of genetic aberrations in tumor tissues is considered the
golden standard for addressing tumor-related genetic mutations. In
this case, the identification of the BRAFV600E mutation
was assessed using blood plasma samples and the correspondent tumor
tissues from five PTC patients and five TN patients (as shown in the Figure 5). As expected, the
PTC patients showed a higher incidence of the BRAFV600E mutation than those of the TN patients (4/5 vs 1/5 of the genomic
DNA). The genetic aberration analysis of PCR products from the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA-enriched
cfDNA identified a BRAFV600E mutation in 6 out of 10 cases,
while the genetic aberration analysis of PCR products from genomic
DNAs of PTC tissues identified a BRAFV600E mutation in
5 out of 10 cases.

bp amplicon.
The positions and nucleotide sequences for the SNP are depicted on
two different strands.

Figure 5 Details of the sequencing
analysis of the PCR products from enriched
cfDNAs and corresponding genomic DNAs of (a) PTC patients and (b)
TN patients. In this case, the black, red, blue, and green curves
represent G (guanosine), T (thymidine), C (cytidine), and A (adenosine),
respectively. A represents the wild genotype, while T represents the
mutant genotype. The detailed information of patients is shown in Table S2.

The ctDNAs (cfDNAs with a BRAFV600E mutation) were matched
well with the BRAFV600E mutation statuses of genomic DNA,
except one TN sample. The result indicates that the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA-enriched
ctDNA test exhibits a slightly higher sensitivity than those of the
genomic DNA test extracted from PTC tissues (6/10 vs 5/10). Furthermore,
we evaluated the capability of the PAAM/PA/PDA-based electrochemical
enrichment strategy by detecting BRAFV600E mutants in 10
blood plasma samples from randomly selected patients. Three of the
10 tested samples (30%) were detected positive of the BRAFV600E mutation (as shown in Table S3 and Figure S6). The phenomenon also suggests that the PAAM/PA/PDA-based electrochemical
enrichment of the ctDNA strategy has great promising potential for
the noninvasive and cost-effective detection of oncogenic mutations.
In comparison with genomic DNAs, an additional mutation was detected
in cfDNAs with a very high apparent frequency (approximately 75%,
as shown in Figure 5 and Figure S6). This mutation was manifested
by a T1799C (shows a G (guanine) mutation in the template strand),
which caused the substitution of valine (V) with alanine (A) at amino
acid residue 600.54 This BRAFV600A mutation was found in the cfDNAs from both cancer patients and noncancer
patients. Because the available data is limited, we still could not
figure out the correlation of the specific disease with the BRAFV600A mutation; further studies are expected for answering
the important question.

Conclusions
In summary, the PAAM/PA/PDA
hydrogel-modified GCE electrode, that
is, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA has been successfully developed for the enrichment
of cfDNA from blood plasma through electric field-mediated transition
of the surface charges of the PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel. Under optimal
conditions, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA shows excellent enrichment efficiencies
and recovery rates of various DNAs and can isolate and enrich ctDNA
from as low as 20 μL of blood plasma. Although we focus on the
BRAFV600E mutations in PTC at present, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
could be applied to detect different oncogenes in other types of malignant
tumors, which is expected to accelerate the applications of ctDNA
in clinical practices such as early diagnosis of cancer, guidance
of patients’ treatment plans through routing analysis, and
tumor prognosis.

Experimental Section
Fabrication of the PAAM/PA/PDA
Hydrogel-Modified Glassy Carbon
Electrode
The PAAM/PA/PDA hydrogel-modified GCE (GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA)
was fabricated by our previously reported strategy (see the Supporting Information for details).41,42 Generally, the GCE (3 mm in diameter) with a mirror-like surface
was activated by glutaraldehyde (GA, 0.5% wt/v). Five microliters
of the mixture of acrylamide (AAM), phytic acid (PA), dopamine (DA), N,N′-methylenebis-acrylamide (MBA),
potassium peroxodisulfate (KPS), and N,N,N′, N′-tetramethyldiamine
(TEMED) were then pipetted onto the GA-modified electrode, placed
at room temperature for 45 min, and gently rinsed by 5 mL of water
(3 times). The surface of the as-prepared GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA was characterized
by an XL30 ESEM-FEG scanning electronic microscope (SEM) at an acceleration
voltage of 20.0 kV (FEI Co., USA). The effects of PAAM/PA/PDA components,
the incubation time of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA with the DNA-containing
solution, and the electrode potential on the DNA enrichment were optimized
through measuring the electron transfer resistance change of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
(ΔRet = RetDNAadsorption – Ret, and ΔR′et = RetDNAdesorption – Ret; herein, Ret, RetDNAadsorption, and RetDNAdesorption are the electron transfer resistances
of the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA, GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA after DNA adsorption, and
GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA/DNA after DNA desorption, respectively) by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS, see the Supporting Information for details).

Patient Characteristics
Ten blood plasma and 10 thyroid
tissue samples were obtained from 10 patients who underwent thyroid
surgery in the Department of Thyroid in the First Hospital of Jilin
University, and patients’ informed consents were obtained before
the surgery. Five patients underwent routine surgery for PTC, while
five patients underwent subtotal thyroidectomy for benign thyroid
nodules (TN). The tumors were diagnosed based on the latest classification
of endocrine tumors of the World Health Organization (WHO). Other
10 blood plasma samples of random patients were obtained from the
clinical laboratory of the First Hospital of Jilin University, and
patients’ informed consents were obtained.

Patient Blood
Plasma and Tissue Sample Collection
Patients’
blood samples (4 mL in volume) were collected in EDTA·K2 tubes and were processed within 30 min. The blood samples were treated
by two-step centrifugation for removing all blood cells. After centrifugation
(4000 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatants of the blood
samples were collected and then centrifuged (12,000 rpm) at 4 °C
for 10 min. The final supernatants were transferred into 1.5 mL Eppendorf
tubes and treated by 50 μL of proteinase K (20 mg/mL), respectively.
After incubation at 55 °C for 2 h, the mixtures were centrifuged
(12,000 rpm) at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatants were carefully
collected and stored at −80 °C until further processing.
The thyroid tissue samples were collected from surgical resection.
After rinsing thoroughly by a physiological saline (0.9 wt% NaCl solution),
the thyroid tissue specimens were cut into small pieces (approximately
1 mm3). Subsequently, the genomic DNA of the thyroid tissue
specimens was extracted by commercial tissue genomic DNA extraction
kits (Biotek Inc., Beijing, China) according to the manufacturer’s
instruction.

Enrichment of DNA by the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA
For enriching
the DNA, the GCE-PAAM/PA/PDA was immersed in 1 mL of Tris buffer (10
mmol/L, pH 7.5) containing different amounts of synthetic ssDNAs or
blood plasma samples of patients under stirring for 45 min, exposed
to 1.0 V for 2 min, washed by 1 mL of Tris buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 7.5),
transferred into 100 μL of a hybridization buffer (0.67 ×
SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) or Tris buffer (10 mmol/L, pH 7.5), and exposed
to −1.0 V for 2 min. For the mimic samples (TM,
TW, 50 NT, and 28 NT in the buffer or blood plasma, see Table S1 for details), the recovered DNAs were
quantified by our previously established DNA microarray-based resonance
light scattering (RLS) assay (see the Supporting Information for details). The recovered DNAs from low concentrations
(0.1 and 0.5 pmol/L) of mimic samples were concentrated to 20 μL
before quantitative measurement. For the blood plasma samples of patients,
the enriched cfDNAs were used as templates for the PCR experiments
(see the Supporting Information for details).
The raw PCR products were directly analyzed by gel electrophoresis
and sequenced by the traditional Sanger sequencing method in Sangon
Ltd. Co. (Shanghai, China).
