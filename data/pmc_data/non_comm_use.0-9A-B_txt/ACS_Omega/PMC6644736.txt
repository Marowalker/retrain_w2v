Pt-based
nanostructured electrocatalysts supported on carbon black
have been widely studied for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
which occurs at the cathode in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Because
sluggish ORR kinetics are known to govern the cell performance, there
is a need to develop highly active and durable electrocatalysts. The
ORR activity of Pt-based electrocatalysts can be improved by controlling
their morphology and alloying Pt with transition metals such as Ni.
Improving the catalyst durability remains challenging and there is
a lack of catalyst design concepts and synthetic strategies. We report
the enhancement of the ORR activity and durability of a nanostructured
Pt–Ni electrocatalyst by strong metal/support interactions
with a nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) support. Pt–Ni rhombic dodecahedral
nanoframes (NFs) were immobilized on the NC support and showed higher
ORR electrocatalytic activity and durability in acidic media than
that supported on a nondoped carbon black. Durability tests demonstrated
that NF/NC showed almost no activity loss even after 50 000
potential cycles under catalytic conditions, and the Ni dissolution
from the NFs was suppressed at the NC support, as confirmed by energy
dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis. Physicochemical measurements
including surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy of surface-adsorbed
CO revealed that the strong metal/support interactions of the NF with
the NC support caused the downshift of the d-band center position
of the surface Pt. Our findings demonstrate that tuning the electronic
structure of nanostructured Pt alloy electrocatalysts via the strong
metal/support interactions with heteroatom-doped carbon supports will
allow the development of highly active and robust electrocatalysts.

Introduction
Heterogeneous noble
metal electrocatalysts are widely used in energy
conversion and storage devices; however, noble-metal catalysts degrade
under harsh device operating conditions. The poor durability and short
lifetimes of electrocatalysts have limited their practical applications.
For example, platinum group metal (PGM) electrocatalysts are used
in the state-of-the-art polymer electrolyte fuel cells to drive the
hydrogen oxidation reaction at the anode and the oxygen reduction
reaction (ORR) at the cathode under acidic conditions. Because slow
ORR kinetics are known to govern the cell performance, there is a
need to develop ORR electrocatalysts with high activity and durability.
Owing to extensive research efforts over the past several decades,
the ORR activity of PGM-based electrocatalysts has been improved by
tuning the surface electronic structure of Pt, including structural
engineering of the Pt morphology and alloying of Pt with transition
metals such as Ni.1 However, there is a
need for a clear strategy to develop new catalysts and improve catalyst
durability.

Engineering of catalyst/support interfaces is a
promising approach
to improving not only the electrocatalytic activity but also durability.
Shape-controlled Pt–M alloys have been immobilized on conductive
support materials and used as electrocatalysts for the ORR. Degradation
mechanisms are known to involve many processes including metal dissolution,
particle detachment, agglomeration, and Oswald ripening under electrocatalytic
conditions.2 These phenomena can be suppressed
by increased metal/support interactions. Carbon black is typically
used as the catalyst support and chemically modified by heteroatom-doping
(N, O, and S) to increase metal/support interactions. Although there
have been some reports on the enhancement of the catalytic activity
(and occasionally on the durability) of Pt, Pt–M alloy nanoparticles,
and 1D nanowires,3,4 it remains unclear whether such
an enhancement can be observed for relatively large 3D nanostructured
Pt–M alloy electrocatalysts (>20 nm) on heteroatom-doped
carbon
supports.

Herein, we report the enhancement of electrocatalytic
ORR activity
and durability of Pt3Ni alloy rhombic dodecahedral nanoframes
(NFs) by immobilization on nitrogen-doped carbon (NC) supports. NFs
show high catalytic activity for the ORR in liquid half-cells and
fuel cells.5,6 Moreover, the ORR catalytic activity of
Pt and Pt–Ni alloy nanoparticles is enhanced by the immobilization
on NC materials.4,7−19 Theoretical studies have also suggested that nitrogen-doping of
carbon nanosheets increases the total metal/support interactions,
including dispersive and covalent interactions with Pt nanoparticles
(>1 nm); however, this is not the case for oxygen- and sulfur-doping.20 These results motivated us to choose NC supports
in this work. To understand the effects of the supports on the catalytic
activity and durability of the NFs, NC supports with different nitrogen
contents (NCT, where T indicates the final heating temperature: 1073, 1173, 1223, and 1273
K) were synthesized from a mixture of melamine and d-glucose
in a multistep heating treatment. Electrochemical measurements of
the NF supported on NCT (NF/NCT) were performed in acidic media under oxygen. Physicochemical
measurements including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), electrochemical
CO-stripping, and surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy
of CO adsorbed on the Pt surface allowed us to investigate modifications
to the electronic structure of the surface Pt, induced by its immobilization
on the NC supports.

Results and Discussion
NFs were
prepared according to the literature methods.5,21,22 Transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images show the successful preparation of a rhombic dodecahedron
morphology with a size of ca. 25 nm (Figure 1a). High-angle annular dark field scanning
TEM (HAADF–STEM) images and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(EDS) mapping revealed that Pt and Ni were homogeneously distributed
in the NF structure (Figure 1b), and the atomic ratio of Pt to Ni was determined to be
3:1.

The nitrogen content of the NCT depended
on the final heating temperature: a higher heating temperature gave
a lower nitrogen content. The nitrogen contents for NC1073, NC1173, NC1223, and NC1273 were
determined by elemental analysis to be 25.3, 11.9, 9.3, and 6.7, respectively
(Table 1). Peak fitting
of the N 1s XPS results for NCT showed
four characteristic peaks for pyridinic N at 398.6 eV, pyrrolic N
at 400.5 eV, graphitic N at 401.3 eV, and oxygenated nitrogen species
at 402 eV (Figure 2 and Table 1).23 The content of pyrrolic nitrogen species decreased
as the heating temperature was increased because pyrrolic nitrogen
is unstable at ≥1173 K.24,25 The content of pyridinic
nitrogen species decreased and the content of graphitic nitrogen species
increased as the heating temperature was increased. Pyridinic N was
the main N species for NC1073 (approximately 56% of the
total N content); however, graphitic N content accounted for the contents
of NC1173, NC1223, and NC1273 (approximately
40%). Similar N contents have been previously reported for N-doped
graphene.23

To understand
the influence of the NCT supports on the
ORR activity of NF, linear sweep voltammograms (LSVs)
of NF/NCT were recorded in an oxygen-saturated
0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution. Reductive currents were observed
for NF/NC1173, NF/NC1223, and NF/NC1273 but not for NF/NC1073 (Figure 3a), indicating that the NFs were electrochemically
active to the ORR on NCT except for NC1073. NF/NC1223 showed the most positive onset potential
in NF/NCT. Thus, the electrocatalytic
activity of the NF for the ORR was maximized by the immobilization
on NC1223, which had a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
specific surface area of 455 m2 g–1 (Figure S1).

Figure 3 (a) LSVs of NF/NCT (T = 1073, 1173, 1223, and 1273 K) and (b)
LSVs of NF/NC1223 (the solid line in red), Pt/C (the solid
line in gray), NF/C (the
solid line in black), and NC1223 without NFs (the broken
line in red). All LSVs were recorded at 10 mV s–1 in a 0.1 M HClO4 aqueous solution under O2 using a rotating disk electrode at 1600 rpm.

The suppression of the ORR activity of the NF on NC1073 can be explained by the aggregation of NFs on NC1073 and
its low electrical conductivity. TEM images of NF/NCT showed that NFs were uniformly dispersed over NCT except for NC1073 (Figure 1c–f). This shows that the NFs were
densely immobilized on the NC1073. The electrical resistivity
of NC1073 at 301 K was determined by a two-probe dc resistivity
measurement to be 8.16 × 103 Ω cm. This resistivity
was approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of NC1173 (9.56 Ω cm), NC1223 (21.3 Ω cm),
and NC1273 (11.1 Ω cm), which were comparable to
that of a commercial nondoped carbon of Vulcan XC-72 (18.5 Ω
cm) (Table 1). The
electrical conductivity of NC materials is known to depend on the
content and/or type of nitrogen present:26−28 pyridinic N
atoms serve as the sites for dipole scattering, decreasing the defect-free-length
of N-doped carbon materials26,29 and providing stable
Pt adsorption sites.16,30,31 Thus, higher nitrogen-doping particularly of pyridinic N content
in N may be associated with the high electrical resistivity of NC1073, together with high loading amounts of NFs, resulting
in the suppression of the ORR activity for the NF on NC1073. Unfortunately, TEM images and electrical resistivity measurements
gave no clear indication as to why the NF showed the highest ORR activity
for NC1223. The support effects on the catalytic activity
appeared to be sensitive to nitrogen-doping content in the range from
5 to 15 wt % and/or the balance of nitrogen species from pyridinic
and graphitic nitrogen atoms.3

The
ORR activity of the NF was enhanced by the immobilization on
NC1223, compared with the use of Vulcan. The LSVs of NF/NC1223 and the NF supported on Vulcan (NF/C, Figure S2) were recorded under oxygen (Figure 3b). The onset potential of NF/NC1223 was more positive than that of NF/C, indicating that the ORR activity
of NF/NC1223 was higher than that of NF/C. Our study indicates
that the optimized NC support enhanced the catalytic activity of the
relatively large 3D nanostructured Pt–Ni alloys, including
the Pt–Ni NF. The specific activity and the mass activity of
NF/NC1223 at +0.95 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode
(RHE) were determined to be 5.6 ± 0.1 A mPt–2 and (3.5 ± 0.2) × 102 A gPt–1, respectively. Note that NC1223 itself
showed almost no catalytic activity for the ORR under the same electrochemical
conditions (Figure 3b), indicating almost no contribution of the catalytic
activity from NC1223 to the results for NF/NC1223 under our experimental conditions.

To understand the origin
of the catalytic activity enhancement
of NF/NC1223, the Pt 4f XPS results for the NF/NC1223 and NF/C were measured and analyzed. Two peaks were observed
in the Pt 4f region for Pt5/2 at ca. 75 eV and Pt7/2 at ca. 72 eV. Each peak was fitted by two peaks, corresponding to
Pt2+ and metallic Pt0 (Figure 4a,b). A comparison of the peak positions
between NF/NC1223 and NF/C allowed us to confirm a positive
shift in binding energy by ca. 0.2 eV (Table S1). This positive shift indicated electron transfer from Pt to NC1223,7−10 implying that strong metal/support interactions (SMSIs) of the NF
with NC1223 modified the electronic structure of Pt.

gray show the second cycle. Potential-dependent SEIRA spectra of CO-adsorbed
(e) NF/NC1223 and (f) NF/C. Bias potentials were stepped
from 0 to 1.0 V vs RHE under Ar. As the reference spectrum, the corresponding
SEIRA spectrum in the absence of CO was used.

The modification of the electronic structure of Pt was confirmed
by electrochemical CO-stripping. Electrochemical CO stripping is extremely sensitive
to the surface composition and defect density, and CO-stripping peak
potentials of Pt-based electrocatalysts are correlated directly with
the Pt d-band center and binding energy.32,33 Electrochemical CO stripping measurements for NF/NC1223 and NF/C produced sharp oxidation peaks at 0.73 V for NF/NC1223 and 0.82 V for NF/C (Figure 4c,d). NF/NC1223 exhibited the
more negative CO-stripping peak potential than NF/C, indicating that
CO was removed more easily from the surface. This potential shift
also indicated a downshift of the d-band center of the surface Pt,
caused by the SMSIs with NC1223. Our findings are supported
by theoretical calculations of Pt clusters supported on N-doped carbon,
where the downshift of the d-band center leads to a decrease of the
adsorption energies of the O species.14,30 Note that
a shoulder peak was also observed at more negative potentials. This
may be associated with CO interparticle oxidation on NFs.34,35

Electrochemically active surface areas were determined based
on
electrochemical CO oxidation charges (ECSACO) and hydrogen
desorption charges (ECSAHupd). The ratio of ECSACO/ECSAHupd was calculated to be 1.39 for NF/C. This ECSACO/ECSAHupd value is greater than 1.0, which was
observed for commercially available Pt/C, suggesting that the Pt–Ni
NF we prepared had the Pt-skin surface.5,22,36 Interestingly, the ECSACO/ECSAHupd ratio of NF/NC1223 was determined to be 0.88, which was
much lower than expected. The lower value may originate from hydrogen
spillover to NC1223. N-doped carbon materials are known
to have a higher hydrogen storage capacity than nondoped carbon, and
the capacity of N-doped carbon materials can be enhanced by the deposition
of Pt nanoparticles via spillover.37 Because
the contribution of the spillover of hydrogen and/or oxygen-containing
species to the ORR activity of Pt nanoparticles has also been discussed,38 spillover effects can also be associated with
the ORR activity enhancement of the NF by NC1223.

The downshift of the d-band center of the surface Pt in the NF
caused by NC1223 was also confirmed by SEIRA spectroscopy
of CO adsorbed on the Pt surface of NF/NC1223 and NF/C
under potential control. Potential-dependent SEIRA spectra of CO-adsorbed
NF/NC1223 and NF/C showed two νCO bands in the range
from 1800 to 2100 cm–1 (Figure 4e,f). The band located in the range from
2000 to 2100 cm–1 is associated with the linearly
bonded CO (COL), whereas the other band in the range from
1800 to 1900 cm–1 is assigned to the bridged CO
(COB).39,40 The peak of the COL can be fitted by two components, which at higher and lower wavenumbers
are assigned to terrace and edge sites, respectively.39−41 Plots of the band position of COL on NF/NC1223 and NF/C as a function of the applied potential showed a linear
relationship (Figure S3). The wavenumber
of the COL band increased with increasing the applied potential.
Such a band shift can be caused by charge transfer of Pt–CO
with the balance between the 5σ donation and the 2π back-donation
of CO.33 The observed wavenumber shift
with an applied potential (ca. 50 cm–1 V–1) was higher than those reported previously for COL on
Pt (ca. 30 cm–1 V–1).42 These higher values may originate from a complex
contribution of the Stark effect and a blue-shift in the COL peak with increasing surface coverage.43,44 The intercept of NF/NC1223 was slightly higher than that
of NF/C, suggesting that the C–O bonding energy of the adsorbed
CO on the Pt surface was higher on NC1223 than that on
the carbon black Vulcan. In general, stronger CO surface chemisorption
energies lead to a lower C–O bonding energy for CO adsorbed
on the surface and a lower C–O stretching wavenumber.35 Furthermore, CO chemisorption energy correlates
with the d band center position of Pt.33 Thus, the CO chemisorption energy to Pt for NF/NC1223 may be lower than that for NF/C, which is in good agreement with
the CO-stripping results.

Both the catalytic activity and the
durability of the NF were enhanced
via SMSIs with NC1223. Figure 5a,b shows LSVs of NF/NC1223 and
NF/C before and after 50 000 potential cycles in the potential
ranges from 0.05 to 1.10 V versus RHE at 10 mV s–1 under oxygen. The half-wave potential shift (ΔE1/2) before and after the potential cycles for NF/NC1223 was ca. 10 mV, which was smaller than that for NF/C (ca.
30 mV). This result clearly indicates that NF/NC1223 was
more robust than NF/C under acidic and oxidative conditions.

NF/NC1223 and (b) NF/C recorded at 10 mV
s–1 in 0.1 M HClO4 under oxygen before
(in black) and after (in red) 50 000 potential cycles. The
potential cycles were performed at 100 mV s–1 under
oxygen. The shifts in half-wave potential before and after the potential
cycles (ΔE1/2) are also shown. HAADF–STEM

TEM observations and EDS analysis on the NF before and after
the
durability tests revealed that the higher durability of NF/NC1223 may originate from the suppression of dealloying by the
support. TEM images of NF/C and NF/NC1223 before and after
the durability test showed no obvious changes in the morphology of
the NF (Figure 5c,d),
allowing us to exclude degradation mechanisms based on the morphological
changes of the NF. EDS analysis after the durability test indicated
the Pt/Ni ratio of 6.0 for NF/NC1223, which was less than
the value of 7.7 for NF/C. Because the Pt/Ni ratio of the original
Pt–Ni NF was approximately 3, as mentioned above, Pt was enriched
after the durability test in each case. Thus, it is most likely that
dealloying was suppressed by the SMSIs, leading to the high electrocatalytic
durability. Similar results have been reported for Pt-based electrocatalysts
supported on NC supports experimentally9,12,13,15,17 and theoretically.45

Conclusions
Both the ORR catalytic activity and durability of the relatively
large 3D nanostructured Pt–Ni alloy NF were enhanced by its
immobilization on the NC support. The immobilization modified the
electronic structure of the Pt surface of the NF via SMSIs, as confirmed
by XPS, electrochemical CO-stripping, and SEIRA spectroscopy of CO
adsorbed on the Pt surface of the NF. Our approach to fine-tuning
of the d-band center position of 3D nanostructured Pt-alloy electrocatalyst
via SMSIs is simpler than conventional approaches such as alloying
of Pt with other metal(s) with different compositions and/or shape-controlling
synthesis of Pt–M alloy nanostructures. Design and fabrication
of metal/support interfaces using heteroatom-doped carbon supports
will be important catalytic development strategies to improving the
catalytic activity and durability of nanostructured metal electrocatalysts
for the ORR and other (electro)chemical reactions,4,46 including
the hydrogen evolution reaction,47 the
formic acid dehydrogenation reaction,48,49 and alcohol
oxidation reactions.50

Experimental
Section
Materials
Ethanol, hexane, chloroform, 2-propanol,
perchloric acid, hexadecane, oleylamine, H2PtCl6·6H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, melamine, and 5% Nafion DE520 were purchased from Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. d-Glucose was purchased from
Junsei Chemical Co. Ltd. Pt/C (TEC10V30E) was purchased from Tanaka
Kikinzoku Kogyo. Pt/C contains 30 wt % of platinum nanoparticles supported
on a carbon black of Vulcan XC-72.

Preparation of NFs
NFs were prepared according to the
literature method.5,21 H2PtCl6·6H2O (100 mg, 0.193 mmol) and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (87.5 mg, 0.301 mmol) were dissolved
in 2 mL of Milli-Q water to give a pale-yellow solution. Oleylamine
(50 mL) was added to the solution. The reaction mixture was heated
at 433 K under N2 for approximately 1 h, heated at 543
K for ca. 10 min to obtain the slurry in black, and then further heated
for ca. 15 min. After that, the reaction flask was put in an ice bath
to quench the reaction. A Pt–Ni bimetallic precursor was isolated
from the reaction mixture and rinsed with ethanol, followed by hexane
under centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min at each step using a Micro
Refrigerated Centrifuge 3700 equipped with an angle rotor AF-5004CA
(Kubota Co.).

The precursor (ca. 3 mg) was dispersed in the
mixture of 0.2 mL oleylamine and 3 mL chloroform. The dispersion was
diluted with hexadecane (10 mL), sonicated for 20 min, and then heated
at 393 K for 8 h under the air. The product was isolated from the
reaction mixture under centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min and rinsed
with ethanol and hexane under centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 10 min
to obtain the Pt–Ni NF. The NF was kept in ethanol to prevent
aggregation.

Preparation of NCT Supports
NCT supports were
prepared based on the
literature procedure.23 The precursors
of melamine (15 g, 0.12 mol) and d-glucose (0.75 g, 4.2 mmol)
were grinded uniformly with a mortar and a pestle, put in a crucible
covered with a lid, heated in a furnace (FP22, Yamato Scientific Co.,
LTD.) at 823 K for 3 h under the air, and then cooled naturally to
the room temperature. The sample was transferred into a tube furnace
(ARF-30KC, Asahi-rika) equipped with a temperature controller (AGC-N,
Asahi-rika) and pre-heated at 373 K for 1 h under an argon flow of
200 sccm, followed by further heating at high temperatures (T = 1073, 1173, 1223, and 1273 K) for 3 h under an argon
flow of 200 sccm.

Preparation of NF/NCT or NF/C
The dispersion of NFs in ethanol was mixed
with the dispersion
of a support, a carbon black of Vulcan XC-72 or NCT, in chloroform. The weight ratio of the NFs to the support
was kept being 3:7. The dispersion was ultrasonicated for at least
30 min. After that, the dispersion was heated at 473 K under the air
for at least 12 h.

Physical Measurements
The elemental
analysis of NCT was performed using CHN
analyzers (CE440,
Exeter Analytical, Inc. and JM10, J-SCIENCE LAB Co., Ltd.) at the
Global Facility Center, Hokkaido University, Japan. For specific surface
area measurements of NC1223, the sample was pretreated
at 373 K under vacuum for 6 h, and then, the measurements were carried
out at 77 K using Belsorp-mini II (MicrotracBEL). Nitrogen was used
as the adsorptive gas. XPS data were collected at a pass energy of
10 eV using an Al X-ray source on a photoelectron spectrometer JPS-9200
(JEOL). The peak of C=C in the C 1s region was used as an internal
standard (284.7 eV) to calibrate the binding energies of the elements.
TEM images were taken by using JEM-2000FX (JEOL). HAADF–STEM
and EDS elemental mapping images were obtained using a JEOL JEM-ARM200F
instrument at 200 kV.

dc Two-Probe Electrical Resistivity Measurements
The
electrical resistivity of NCT and carbon
black was measured by a dc two-probe method with a Keithley 6487 Picoammeter/Voltage
Source. A sample was sandwiched by the copper plates with Kapton as
the spacer. Voltages were applied at 10 mV for NC1073 and
1 mV for the others. Temperatures were controlled by using an Anton
Paar TTK 450 low temperature chamber and a Lake Shore model 331 temperature
controller.

Electrochemical Measurements
A glassy
carbon (GC) disk
(5 mm φ, GC-20SS, Tokai Carbon Co., Ltd.) was polished with
alumina slurry (0.3 μm), followed by alumina slurry (0.05 μm)
before drop-casting a catalytic ink. To prepare the catalyst ink,
0.70 mg of a catalyst (NF/NCT, NF/C, or
Pt/C), 0.30 mL of 2-propanol, 0.95 mL of Milli-Q water, and 5.0 μL
of 5% Nafion DE520 were mixed under ultrasonication in an ice bath
for at least 30 min. The catalyst ink (10 μL) was drop-cast
on the GC disk that was rotating at 700 rpm using an AFMSRX Analytical
Rotator and a MSRX Speed Controller (PINE Research Instrumentation).
The catalyst ink was dried at room temperature and then heated at
418 K for 5 min in a furnace (FP22, Yamato Scientific). The catalyst-modified
GC disk was used as the working electrode.

Electrochemical measurements
were performed using a conventional three-electrode setup. A potentiostat
of Compactstat (Ivium) was used to perform cyclic voltammetry and
linear sweep voltammetry. Cyclic voltammograms (CVs) and LSVs were
recorded in an aqueous solution containing 0.1 M HClO4 under
argon or oxygen. The electrolyte solution was purged with argon or
oxygen for at least 30 min before electrochemical measurements. A
rotating disk electrode was used as the working electrode. An Ag|AgCl
(sat. KCl) electrode with a double junction holder (International
chemistry Co., Ltd) and platinum foil were used as the reference electrode
and the counter electrode, respectively. All LSVs under oxygen are
shown in positive going sweep and corrected by the subtraction of
the current densities of the corresponding working electrode recorded
under argon. All potentials are shown against the RHE.

For durability
tests, LSVs under oxygen were recorded in a 0.1
M HClO4 aqueous solution up to 50 000 potential cycles
in the potential range from 0.6 to 1.0 V versus RHE at a sweep rate
of 100 mV s–1 under oxygen. During the potential
cycling, a doubly junctioned Ag|AgCl (sat. KCl) electrode and a porous
carbon electrode (BAS Inc.) were used as the reference and the counter
electrode, respectively.

ECSAs were determined based on charges
on the H desorption (ECSAHupd) and electrochemical CO-stripping
(ECSACO)
from the Pt surface, where it was assumed that the H desorption and
CO-stripping require 0.21 and 0.42 mC cm–2, respectively.
The specific activity of NF/NC1223 was determined based
on the ECSACO. To determine ECSAHupd, electrochemical
measurements were performed in 0.1 M HClO4 solution under
Ar at room temperature. For CO-stripping measurements, the electrolyte
solution was purged with CO for 10 min and then with Ar for 60 min,
where a bias potential of 0.05 V versus RHE was applied to a sample
electrode during purging.

Preparation of SEIRAS-Active Au Thin-Film
Electrodes
The Au thin-film was prepared on a half cylindrical
Si prism (Pier
Optics Co., Ltd.) by a “double-deposition” method.51,52 The prism surface was polished on a polishing pad (BAS) with alumina
powder (1 μm, Baikalox), suspended in water, and then polished
with tissue paper (Kimwipes, Nippon Paper Crecia Co., Ltd.) in running
tap water until the surface became hydrophilic. The prism was rinsed
under ultrasonication in Milli-Q water twice, acetone, and then Milli-Q
water for 5 min each to remove the alumina powder completely from
the Si surface. The surface was contacted with 40% NH4F
aqueous solution for 90 s to remove surface oxide and then rinsed
with Milli-Q water. The Si prism was heated on a hot plate at 343
K until the electroless deposition of Au. For the preparation of a
plating solution, 1 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.03 M NaAuCl4 was added to 1 mL of an aqueous solution containing 0.3 M
Na2SO3, 0.1 M Na2S2O3, and 0.1 M NH4Cl, followed by the addition of
1 mL of 2 vol % HF aqueous solution, and then the obtained plating
solution was heated at 343 K. After ca. 15 min, ca. 1.5 mL of the
plating solution was drop-cast onto the Si prism surface and kept
for ca. 1 min to obtain a gold film. The Au film was dissolved with
ca. 200 μL of aqua regia, and then, the Si surface was rinsed
with Milli-Q water. Subsequently, Au was re-deposited on the Si prism
in the same manner until the Au film on the Si prism showed resistances
of 10 to 20 Ω, checked by using a multimeter. A roughness factor
of the Au film was determined to be 2.5 to 3.5 based on a reduction
wave for a gold oxide film in a CV recorded in a potential range between
0 and 1.4 V versus Ag|AgCl (sat. KCl) at a sweep rate of 0.05 V s–1 in 0.1 M H2SO4 aqueous solution
under Ar.

SEIRA Spectroscopy Measurements
SEIRA spectra were
recorded on a Varian 7000 FT-IR spectrometer equipped with a mercury–cadmium–telluride
detector cooled with liquid nitrogen. We use two infrared polarizers
(Sankei Technics LLC) in front of the sample to obtain s- and p-polarized
light beams. The polarization-modulated spectra in absorbance were
defined as A = −log(Ip/Is), where Ip and Is are the single-beam
intensities of the reflected p- and s-polarized infrared radiation,
respectively.53 The differential spectra
were calculated as Asample – Aref, where Asample and Aref are the sample and reference
absorbance, respectively. In this work, Asample and Aref were collected for CO-adsorbed
Pt–Ni NFs and bare Pt–Ni NFs at the same bias potential,
respectively. The spectral resolution was set to 4 cm–1, and 256 interferograms were collected and averaged for each spectrum.

For the sample preparation, catalyst ink (100 μL) was drop-cast
on the Au/Si prism and then heated at 418 K for 5 min. The prepared
sample as the working electrode was fixed with a custom-made glass
electrochemical cell. A platinum foil was used as the counter electrode
and an Ag|AgCl (sat. KCl) electrode was used as the reference electrode.
Before SEIRA spectral measurements, potential cycles in the potential
range between 0.26 and 1.26 V versus RHE were performed in a 0.1 M
HClO4 aqueous solution at a sweep rate of 200 mV s–1 under Ar for cleaning of the Pt surface. For backgrounds,
SEIRA spectra of the sample were collected under Ar from 0 to 1.0
V versus RHE. After that, the electrolyte solution was purged with
CO for 10 min and then with Ar for 60 min, where a bias potential
of 0.05 V versus RHE was applied to the electrode during purging.
SEIRA spectra of the CO-adsorbed sample were collected in the potential
range from 0 to 1.0 V versus RHE under Ar.
