From
a series of competition experiments, we have explored the
degree to which various para-substituents (CN, Br, H, OMe, pyrrolidino)
of a 2-O-benzoyl functionalized glucosyl donor of
the thioglycoside type affect the rate of glycosylation under N-iodosuccinimide/triflic acid activation. As expected,
electron-withdrawing groups were found to decrease the rate of glycosylation,
whereas electron-donating groups resulted in the opposite outcome,
underscoring the influence on the reaction rate exerted by a participating
group. On this basis, a Hammett linear free-energy relationship was
established (R2 = 0.979, ρ = 0.6),
offering fundamental insight into the magnitude of anchimeric assistance
in glycosylation chemistry.

Introduction
It is well established
that the inductive effect exerted by an
ether group is smaller compared to an ester group.1 This makes it intuitive to understand the difference in
reactivity between the classically armed and disarmed donors (being
perbenzylated and peracylated, respectively) given the nature of the
high-energy electron-deficient oxacarbenium ion-like transition state.2 Upon construction of glycosyl donors with mixed
protecting groups, e.g., of both ether and ester type,3 the level of reactivity is no longer so clear.

Earlier
results by Fraser-Reid,2 Ley,4a Wong,4b and their
respective co-workers have demonstrated that knowing the precise order
of reactivity as a function of protecting groups can be a valuable
tool for streamlining saccharide assembly in that it allows one-pot
multistep reactions.

We have elaborated on Wong’s work
by fine-tuning the reactivity
of armed donors by using electron-rich p-methoxybenzyl
ethers and electron-poor p-chloro and p-cyanobenzyl ethers as protective groups, which enabled us to perform
the first armed–disarmed couplings among benzylated glycosyl
donors.5

The presence of a participating
ester group, e.g., 2-O-benzoyl, can have both an
arming effect originating from anchimeric
assistance, if the C-1-leaving group is trans to the C-2 substituent,
but also an opposing disarming effect due to the strong electron-withdrawing
nature of an ester.6 We have confirmed
reports by the Demchenko group7 that a
significantly higher level of reactivity (superarmament)8 can be achieved for an S-benzoxazolyl
glucosyl donor carrying a 2-O-benzoyl group under
dimethyl(methylthio)sulfonium triflate activation (Figure 1A). We, however, also found
that this is not general because both the same and analogous building
blocks bearing SPh and SEt donor functionalities were less reactive
than their traditionally armed tetra-O-benzylated
counterparts with N-iodosuccinimide/triflic acid
(NIS/TfOH) activation (Figure 1B). These results have demonstrated that two opposing effects
operate (anchimeric and electron-withdrawing) and contribute in varying
degrees to the overall reactivity depending on the donor and promoter
systems.9

Figure 1 Current study (C) in relation to previous
findings (A and B).

This article describes
our attempts to control and fine-tune the
reactivity of a SPh-functionalized glucosyl donor by changing the
para-substituent of a 2-O-benzoyl-protecting group
(Figure 1C). This would
provide insight into the sensitivity to anchimeric assistance and
possibly lead to a superarmed glucosyl donor with NIS/TfOH activation.

We anticipate that electron-donating groups like methoxy (OMe)
would be accelerating in terms of both being better equipped for performing
anchimeric assistance than with H in place of OMe, but also possess
a reduced deactivating effect due to a decreased electron-withdrawing
influence.

Results and Discussion
To systematically investigate
the influence of a 2-O-benzoyl para-substituent on
the glycosyl donor reactivity, we set
out to synthesize a range of donors with varying substituents being
both electron-withdrawing (CN, Br) and electron-donating (OMe, pyrrolidino).

The target glycosyl donors 3–6 (Scheme 1) were
prepared from 2-OH thioglucoside 7 by first synthesizing
the target molecule 3 via reaction with p-bromobenzoyl chloride using our method for easy removal of excess
acylating reagent with 3-(dimethylamino)-1-propylamine (DMAPA).10 Cyano- and methoxybenzoyl-protected donors 4 and 5 were synthesized from 3 by
a procedure similar to those previously described by us for the conversion
of 4-chlorobenzyl ethers to 4-methoxybenzyl11,12 and 4-cyanobenzyl ethers13 using a commercially
available palladium precatalyst system and ligands developed by the
Buchwald group.14 For the amination with
pyrrolidine, the palladium precatalyst RuPhos Pd G3 was chosen and
successfully yielded aniline 6 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis
of Glycosyl Donors Using Palladium-Catalyzed Reactions
After having prepared the range of target glycosyl
donors with
different 2-O-protection, their performance in glycosylation
reactions with l-menthol under NIS/TfOH promotion was investigated.
All the donors (1–6) were found to
easily activate under the reaction conditions and good and reproducible
yields were obtained (see the Supporting Information). Next, to evaluate the reactivity of the glycosyl donors, each
of the 2-O-benzoylated thioglucosides (3–6) were set to compete against tetra-O-benzylated thioglucoside (1) for a limiting
amount of NIS. More specifically, the experiments were performed by
mixing the two competing donors (1 equiv. of each) and checking that
their molar ratio was 1.0:1.0 by 13C-NMR spectroscopy by
comparing C-1 resonances.15 Next, excess
acceptor (l-menthol, 5 equiv.) and promoter (NIS, 1 equiv.)
were added to the donor mixture. The reaction was initiated at −78
°C by the addition of a catalytic amount of triflic acid (TfOH,
0.1 equiv.) and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm to 0 °C
over 3 h. After reaction completion and work-up, another 13C-NMR spectrum of the crude reaction mixture was recorded and the
anomeric signals again compared. The postreaction ratio of unreacted
donors is a direct result of the reactivity difference between the
competing donors because a smaller amount of the less reactive donor
will be consumed and vice versa. The reactions were carried out several
times and, as previously established, found to give highly reproducible
results.5

The results from the conducted
competition experiments can be seen
in Table 1. The nature
of the 2-O-benzoyl para-substituents were found to
have a measureable impact on the reactivity of the glycosyl donors,
as also previously observed for the analogous para-substituted benzyl
ethers.5 The order of reactivity was as
expected according to the electron-withdrawing/donating power of the
substituents. Under the NIS/TfOH activation used in this study, not
even the more reactive p-methoxybenzoylated donor
was as reactive as the tetra-O-benzylated donor 6 (entry 4).

Donors (Conditions: 1 Equiv. NIS, 0.1 Equiv. TfOH, 5 Equiv. l-Menthol, −78 to 0 °C, 3 h)
The most reactive donor was found to be the p-pyrrolidino
donor 5, which was inspired by the hypernucleophilic
acylation catalyst 4-pyrrolidinopyridine.16 Despite the presence of a basic aniline, which potentially could
inhibit thioglycoside activation, this donor (6) could
still be activated under the applied conditions and was found to be
the only one studied that was more reactive than the tetra-O-benzylated donor 1. Finally, as a confirmation
of our method, a competition experiment between the 2-O-benzoylated donor 2 and the p-methoxybenzoylated
donor 5 was performed (entry 6).

Given the variations
in reactivity adhering to the expected order
according to Hammett constants (σp), it was decided
to see how well the measured data would appear in a Hammett-type plot.
The reactivity of the listed donors was all evaluated identically
in comparison to the same tetra-O-benzylated donor
(1). The numbers (reactivity ratio, RR) listed in Table 1 are naturally not
a ratio of rate constants because there is a “catching up effect”
of the slower-reacting donor. As the difference in reactivity overall
is small (within an order of magnitude), we will make the assumption
that the following is a good approximation to be used for a linear
free energy relationship because imperfections in rate constant determination
would cancel out  σp values were taken from
a review by Taft and co-workers17 and NMe2 was used as an approximate value for the pyrrolidino group.

A good correlation was established (R2 = 0.979, N = 5), with a slope of ρ = 0.6
(Figure 2). The obtained
straight line suggests a conserved reaction mechanism across the tested
range of donors.

The reactivity difference measured between
donor 5 and 2 fits to that calculated based
on the values obtained
from the Hammett plot.

In a previous study by Huang and co-workers,
where the para-substituent
of phenyl thioglucosyl donors were studied,18 a slope of ρ = 3.4 (R2 = 0.99,
acceptor: MeOH) was found, which shows a much larger sensitivity to
substituent variations compared to the present situation.

During
a previous study, we separated the effects of anchimeric
assistance, anomeric stereochemistry, and electron-withdrawing power
of a 2-OBz compared to a 2-OBn under NIS/TfOH activation.8,9 Here, we found that the neighboring group acceleration (anchimeric
effect) from a 2-OBz substituent is inferior to the oppositely directed
electron-withdrawing effect with respect to phenyl thioglucosides
reactivity under NIS/TfOH activation. Still, given the significance
of the anchimeric effect, it would be expected to be the major contributor
to the reactivity variations found in the present study. Another possible
cause of the observed variations in rate could simply be based on
the differences in the inductive effects of the C-2 substituent.

To gain an insight into this, p-cyano- and p-methoxy-benzoylated donors (3 and 4, respectively) were competed against one another in both α-
and β-series. A much greater difference in reactivity was measured
for the β-anomers in accordance with the expected accelerating
achimeric effect. The smaller difference, found for the analogous
α-configured donors (12 and 13), is
a measure of the inductive difference between the two (Table 2).Table 2 Competition

Conclusions
We have studied the effect on the reactivity
of para-substituted
2-O-benzoyls in glucosylation reactions with phenyl
thioglucosides under NIS/TfOH activation and established the level
of sensitivity to the electronic nature of the substituent. The study
has given rise to a linear free-energy relationship, where Hammett
σp constants were found to correlate well to the
reactivity of the tested glucosyl donors.

The most reactive
glycosyl donor explored in this study was found
to have a 2-O-(p-pyrrolidino)-benzoyl
substituent. This was prepared from the less reactive 2-O-(p-bromo)-benzoylated donor via Pd catalysis. Although
the reactivity difference most likely is too small for chemoselective
activation of the former donor type, the chemistry presented in the
present study could possibly be used in combination with other effects
for fine-tuning the reactivity, which would allow for rapid oligosaccharide
assembly.

Experimental Section
General Methods
All the reagents
were used as purchased
without further purification. Dry solvents were taken from a solvent
purification system. Importantly, high-quality NIS was used (Chempur
(004499), N-iodosuccinimide/98%+). Glassware used
for water-sensitive reactions were dried for 12 h at 120 °C before
use. Columns for chromatography were packed with silica gel 60 (230–400
mesh) as the stationary phase. The thin-layer chromatography plates
were visualized by 10% H2SO4 in EtOH and heating
until spots appeared. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a 400 MHz spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm relative to the residual solvent signal. High-resolution
mass spectral (HRMS) data were obtained on an electrospray (ES) mass
spectrometer analyzing time of flight.

General Procedure for Glycosylations
Glycosyl donor
(0.10 mmol) and glycosyl acceptor (0.15 mmol) were dissolved in CH2Cl2 (2 mL) before freshly activated molecular sieves
(3 Å, 100 mg) were added. The mixture was stirred under argon
for 1 h at ambient temperature and then cooled to −78 °C
using a dry ice/acetone bath. At this temperature, first NIS (0.11
mmol) and then TfOH (0.1 mL of a 0.1 M solution of TfOH in CH2Cl2) were added. The pieces of dry ice were then
removed from the cold bath, allowing the reaction vessel to reach
0 °C over approximately 3 h. At this temperature, the solids
were filtered off and the filtrate was washed with 10% Na2S2O3 in water. The organic phase was separated,
dried over MgSO4, and concentrated under reduced pressure,
and the residue purified by flash column chromatography on a silica
gel to afford the corresponding glycoside. Anomeric ratios were measured
by comparing the integral intensities of H-1 and C-1 from 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra of crude reaction mixtures.

Competition Experiments
The competing glycosyl donors
(0.10 mmol each) were first dissolved in CDCl3 (1 mL) and
their ratio checked to be 1.0:1.0 by 1H NMR and 13C NMR. Then, the solvent was removed in reduced pressure and the
mixture redissolved in dry CH2Cl2 (2 mL) before l-menthol (0.5 mmol) and freshly activated molecular sieves
(3 Å, 100 mg) were added. The mixture was stirred at ambient
temperature under an atmosphere of argon for 1 h before cooling to
−78 °C in an dry ice/acetone bath. At this temperature,
first NIS (0.10 mmol) and then TfOH (0.1 mL of a 0.1 M solution of
TfOH in CH2Cl2) were added. The pieces of dry
ice were then removed, allowing the temperature to reach 0 °C
(approximately 3 h). At this time, all the solids were filtered off
and the filtrate washed with aqueous Na2S2O2 solution (10%). The organic phase was then separated, dried
over MgSO4, and concentrated. Next, the crude mixture was
dissolved in CDCl3 (1 mL) and 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded. The ratio of unreacted donors
were measured by comparing the integral intensities of anomeric protons
and anomeric carbons from 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectra of crude reaction mixtures.

Phenyl 3,4,6-Tri-O-benzyl-2-O-(p-bromobenzoyl)-1-thio-β-d-glucopyranoside
(3)
A suspension of phenyl 3,4,6-tri-O-benzyl-2-O-acetyl-1-thio-β-d-glucopyranoside8 (1.29 g, 2.15
mmol) in MeOH was heated to 40 °C to improve the solubility and
sodium methoxide solution (25 wt % in MeOH) was added until a pH value
of approximately 10 was reached. The reaction mixture was stirred
for 5 h and then neutralized with DOWEX acidic ion exchanger. The
solid was filtered off and filtrate concentrated in vacuo, leaving
the crude 2-hydroxyl glycoside 7.

The 2-hydroxyl
glycoside 1 was dissolved in anhydrous CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and DMAP (132 mg, 1.07 mmol, 0.5 equiv.),
Et3N (1.49 mL, 10.7 mmol, 5 equiv.), and 4-bromobenzoyl
chloride (1.89 g, 8.59 mmol, 4 equiv.) were added. The orange slurry
was stirred at room temperature (rt) for 18 h under N2 atmosphere
before being quenched by the addition of DMAPA10 (1.08 mL, 8.54 mmol, 4 equiv.). The reaction mixture was
stirred with DMAPA for 10 min before washing with aq. 1 M aq. HCl
(three times), sat. aq. NaHCO3, and brine. The organic
phase was dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated
in vacuo. Recrystallization of the resulting residue from EtOAc/pentane
yielded the product (1.33 g, 1.83 mmol) as a white flocculent solid
in 85% yield over two steps. Rf (EtOAc/pentane

screw-cap septum, the vessel was evacuated and backfilled with argon
(this process was repeated for a total of three times). Dioxane (0.3
mL) and 0.05 M KOAc in degassed water (0.3 mL) were added to the reaction
vial via a syringe. The vial was placed in an oil bath preheated to
100 °C and stirred for 1.5 h at maximum stirring (1500 rpm).
The reaction mixture was then cooled to rt and transferred to a separatory
funnel using EtOAc and brine. The blue aqueous layer was further extracted
with EtOAc (twice). The combined organic layers were dried over MgSO4, filtered, and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was purified
