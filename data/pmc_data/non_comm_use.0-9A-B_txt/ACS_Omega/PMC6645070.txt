In
our previous work, it was shown that the separation performance
of the fixed-site-carrier polyvinylamine (PVAm) composite membrane
increases exponentially with increasing relative humidity content
in the gas. Through these efforts, it has been important to develop
a greater understanding of the relationship between the water, structural,
and interfacial properties of the PVAm surface. The degree of hydrophilicity
of a given surface plays a crucial role in the separation performance
of the membrane when exposed to a humidified gas. Therefore, in the
current work, the wettability properties of PVAm at different pHs
have been studied by experimental measurements and molecular dynamic
simulations. It was confirmed that the intramolecular interactions
are not linearly dependent on pH. As well as the H-bonding between protonated and unprotonated amine
groups, the conformation polymer chain and the distribution charge
density play a crucial role in the surface stability and wettability
properties.

1 Introduction
Polyvinylamine
(PVAm) is a linear polyelectrolyte type of polymer,
which is water-soluble with high contents of primary amine and thereby
high ion content. Measurements have revealed contents as high as 19
meq/g polymer.1 The amine groups in the
polymer are flexible and may function as reaction sites, thus the
polymer becomes very attractive as a functional polymer having a variety
of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties at the macroscopic surface/interface.2 Furthermore, PVAm is highly pH sensitive, which
enables the polymer to be stimuli-responsive.3−5 PVAm has been
synthesized following different routes.6,7 However, from
polyacrylamide by the Hofmann reaction8 is the most used route. High molecular weight PVAm can also be obtained
commercially.

PVAm is an attractive polymer to use in different
fields, including
biomedical applications,9 encapsulation,10,11 oil recovery,12 and especially, it has
been extensively studied as a fixed-site-carrier polyvinylamine membrane
for carbon dioxide capture where a thin selective layer of PVAm is
deposited on a polysulfone support. These membranes13−25 have been reported both as composite flat sheets and hollow fiber
membranes.26,27 One of the reasons for its success
is because the PVAm coating on the membrane acts as the transport
medium for the CO2 in humidified gas. The amine group performs
as the carrier of the CO2, increasing the transport performance
of the membrane by facilitating the reaction taking place in addition
to the conventional solution-diffusion mechanism. PVAm composite membranes
in dry conditions will separate according to a solution-diffusion
mechanism only. It was documented by Kim et al. in 20048 that by allowing the membrane to be exposed to
gas with high relative humidity, the separation performance increased
exponentially.8,22,26 It is, however, important to develop a more comprehensive understanding
of the relationships between the structure and the interfacial properties
of the PVAm–water surface. The degree of hydrophilicity of
a given surface requires an understanding of the microscale principles
that, in turn, control the macroscale surface-wetting behavior. Moreover,
all of these applications are possible because of the adsorbing potential
of the PVAm surface with water and the pH-dependent polycationic nature
of PVAm.28 Hence, to use PVAm as a membrane
for separation of selected gas components, the amine groups in the
polymer must preferably be unprotonated for them to be available to
promote the facilitated transport of selected gas components (i.e.,
CO2). It is therefore of vital importance to understand
the impact of water and pH on the separation performance.

Studies
based on molecular modeling should, in principle, offer
help on an atomistic level for understanding these interactions and
therefore establish a theoretical tool to predict the relevant technological
parameter values. In the current work, these PVAm–water interactions
were studied at the nanoscale level, both by experimental measurements
and molecular modeling. The molecular dynamic simulations contribute
to an understanding of the inter–intramolecular interactions
and moreover of the transport mechanism giving the possibility to
estimate the related technological parameter values.

2 Experimental Work
2.1 Membrane Preparation
The membrane
was prepared by casting a pH-adjusted 3 wt % PVAm solution onto a
Teflon plate.8,26 Casting solutions of pHs 4, 10,
and 12 were used. The desired thickness of PVAm was controlled by
pouring a known volume of solution into a confined circular Teflon
mold with known surface area. The resulting PVAm thickness was 20
μm on a dry basis for all membranes. The membranes were dried
at 45 °C and kept at room temperature for 24 h, they were then
deep dried at 90 °C for 1 h, and finally cooled down in the oven
for 1 h. The thickness of the dry membranes was confirmed by several
measurements randomly distributed across the membrane using a micrometer
Digitrisk II NSK (0.001–25 mm).

Because of the low mechanical
strength of the PVAm membrane when cast as a stand-alone selective
layer, defects may appear during the preparation. For this reason,
performing permeation tests in dry and wet (relative humidity RH%)
conditions was very challenging.

2.2 Swelling
Test
The swelling performance
of the PVAm membrane under different humid conditions at room temperature
was measured. The samples of PVAm of pHs 4, 10, and 12, which were
cast into films on the Teflon plate, were placed in a hydrophobic
plastic Petri dish and mounted into a closed humidity chamber. Beneath
the polymer film, different saturated salt solutions were added but
not in direct contact with the polymer, see Figure 1; the solutions used were all saturated solutions
at room temperature. Here, the solutions are stated with equilibrium
relative humidity at 25 °C in brackets: K2SO4 (97% RH), NaCl (75% RH), and MgCl2 (33% RH). The water
uptake of the membrane exposed to 33, 75, and 97% RH humidity in air,
as explained and illustrated in Figure 1, was investigated.

Figure 1 Polymeric film sample in humidity chamber
with saturated salt solution
for swelling test.

The samples were removed
from the chamber and weighed at regular
intervals to determine the membrane water uptake from the gas phase
in equilibrium with the saturated salt solution. After each weighing,
the membrane was remounted into the chamber as quickly as possible
and the lid of the chamber was kept loosely fit on the chamber during
the weighing to minimize the disturbance to the system. This procedure
was repeated until the film reached a constant weight (equilibrium
water uptake). The water swelling degree (SD) of the membrane was
calculated according to the following equation: 1  where Ws and Wd are the masses of the swollen
and dry membranes,
respectively.

2.3 Contact Angle Measurement
A CAM 200
optical contact angle meter (KSV Instruments, Finland) with sessile
drop method was used for the determination of the contact angle. A
droplet of distilled water (3 μL) was carefully placed on the
top surface of the membrane and the contact angles were determined
using the high-speed optimum video analysis system. This unit is equipped
with a FireWire camera module for measuring 100 images/s based on
geniometry. A CAM 200 uses drop shape analysis for determining static
contact angle, where the contact angle can be assessed by fitting
the Young–Laplace equation to the drop profile. Using eq 2, each reported contact
angle measurement is the average of 30 individual measurements. 2  where ΔP is Laplace
pressure, γ is surface tension, and R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature.

2.4 Surface
Tension
The pendant drop
method was used to determine the surface tension of the different
PVAm membranes in solution (gas/liquid interface). The shape of the
liquid drop hanging on the needle is determined from the balance forces,
which include the surface tension of the liquid. The surface tension
was determined by analyzing the drop shape of the following equation. 3  where γ is surface
tension, Δρ
is density difference between fluids, g is gravitational
constant, R0 is radius of drop curvature
at apex, and β is a shape factor that can be defined through
the Young–Laplace equation expressed as three dimensionless
first order equations (see SI for full
details).

3 Computational Models
3.1 Computational Details for Surface Properties
In this
work, the computational protocols proposed in our previous
work were applied for analyzing the wettability properties of the
polymers and surface,29 and gas transport
properties through the membrane polymers based on molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation.30 All MD simulations were
performed using (BIOVIA Materials Studio, v. 8.0, San Diego, 2017)
commercial software. To obtain an accurate surface properties prediction at an atomistic
scale, it is necessary to consider the force fields (FFs) employed,
the cutoff for the nonbonded interactions, fractional free volume
(FFV), density and conformation of the polymers, and FFs suitable
for reproducing structural, thermodynamic, and dynamical properties
of the polymer under conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium. The
model of the polymer chain must be as accurate as possible. The condensed-phase
optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation studies31 (COMPASS) class II ab initio force field was
used to describe the potential of the systems. COMPASS has been demonstrated
to be able to predict, with high accuracy, the densities of a number
of liquids at different state points.32,33 Moreover,
the accuracy of COMPASS to treat polymers has already been demonstrated
in other works34 and has been extensively
parameterized for gases, including He, H2, O2, N2, and CO2.35 The COMPASS FF is the total potential energy of a molecular system,
which in general terms is expressed as the sum of the following equations. 4   5   6   7  The Unonbond interactions,
which include a Lennard-Jones 9-6 function for the van
der Waals (vdW) term and a coulomb function for electrostatic interactions,
see eq 8, are used for
interactions between pairs of atoms that are separated by two or more
intervening atoms or those that belong to different molecules. The
Lj-9-6 parameters (ε and r0) are
given for like atom pairs. 8  The electrostatic interaction is represented
using atomic partial charges, qi, applied
to each atomic species and derived from ab initio calculations. To
make the charge parameters transferable, bond increments, δij, which represent the charge separation
between two valence-bonded atoms i and j, are used as parameters in the COMPASS FF. For atom i, the partial charge is the sum of all charge bond increments δij. 9  where j represents all atoms
that are valence-bonded to atom i.

3.2 Contact Angle Determination and Modeling Details
To
achieve a good compromise between accuracy and computational
time, the water model extended simple point charge model (SPC/E)36 and 500 SPC/E water molecules were employed
in the construction of the water droplet model.37−40 The initial water cluster, corresponding
to a cubic liquid water configuration with side length 2.46 nm and
density ρ = 1 g/cm3 (see SI for full details), was energetically optimized using the COMPASS
FF.

This was done via a combination of conjugate gradient/Newton–Raphson
iterations using a convergence criterion of 10–3 kcal/(mol Å), The particle mesh Ewald (PME) method41 and an atom-based cutoff of 12.5 Å were
used to treat electrostatic and Van der Waals interactions, respectively.
This model is described in detail in our previous work.29

The generation of an accurate model of
the amorphous polymer surface
was conducted as follows: First, for the PVAm polymer, 6 chains with
a degree of polymerization set to 12 were generated and subjected
to energy relaxation using COMPASS. It is important to note here that
although such small oligomers would hardly capture a genuine response
to the behavior of a real polymer chain, it has been shown that all
typical features of the fast segmental dynamics of interfacial polymer
chains can indeed be explored using much shorter molecules.42

The conformational search was carried
out using the combined molecular
mechanics/molecular dynamics simulated annealing (MDSA) protocol.43 According to this, the relaxed structure was
subjected to five repeated temperature cycles (from 298 to 600 K and
vice versa) using a canonical thermodynamic ensemble. In this protocol,
the number of particles N, volume V, and temperature T, NVT, remain
fixed in MD conditions. At the end of each annealing cycle, each structure
was again energy minimized to converge below 10–4 kcal/(mol Å), and only those structures corresponding to the
minimum energy were used for further modeling. The next step was to
generate a cubic box starting with the optimized polymer chain and
using the Theodorou and Suter version44 of the rotational isomeric state method45 at T = 298 K and applying the density of the polymer
obtained from experiments. Table 1 displays these density values.

The model equilibration was conducted as follows:
from the fully
relaxed models of the corresponding polymeric chains, isothermal–isochoric
(NVT) MD simulations were run at 298 K to equilibrate
the systems and to ensure that their minimized total energy remains
constant with respect to the timescale used in the simulation. To
get the equilibrated bulk model polymer, the approach originally proposed
by Rigby34 was adopted. Thus, a cubic periodic
cell of the polymer with a density close to the literature value at T = 298 K, after an initial energy minimization, was subjected
to 0.01 ns of NVT MD simulation using velocity scaling,
to quickly establish the temperature, followed by 0.04 ns using the
Andersen thermostat.46 Density equilibration
is then achieved by performing a further 1 ns of constant pressure
constant temperature (NPT) MD simulations again using
the Andersen thermostat and the Berendsen barostat.47 The atom-based method with a cutoff of 9.5 Å was used
to treat both electrostatic and van der Waals interactions.

To generate a large enough surface in the XY plane
to prevent the droplet water molecules from interacting with each
other in the periodic image, the periodic cells were replicated in x and y directions to yield final cell
dimensions of PVAm as reported in Table 1. The modeling of individual components and
the overall systems (i.e., water droplet on PVAm surface) was thus
built. As a first step, to avoid interference of neighboring images
in the vertical direction, the z dimension of the
polymer cell was extended to 15 nm. Then, the equilibrated water droplet
was placed and centered on the top of the polymeric surface at an
initial distance of about 3 Å. The resulting system was relaxed
and subsequently subjected to 1250 ps of NVT MD simulations
at T = 298 K, keeping the polymeric surface fixed.
The Ewald method41,48 was applied for treating all
nonbonded interactions. The Berendsen thermostat with a decay constant
of 0.1 ps, as discussed in Manias and Kuppa,42 was adadopted for temperature control, and 1 fs was chosen as the
Verlet integration time step. The first 750 ps of the MD simulation
was required to reach the equilibrium state, monitored by the large
and rapid decay of the average internal energy of the system followed
by a steady plateau. The remaining 500 ps of equilibrated MD trajectory
was used for data harvesting and analysis. To determine the contact
angle (CA), the computational protocols proposed in our previous work29 were employed, in which the θ value of
a spherical liquid droplet on a given (e.g., polymeric) surface was
obtained from the relevant equilibrated MD trajectories.

3.3 Contact Angle Analysis
The relationship
between contraction force (surface tension) and attraction force (surface
free energy) was integrated in the contact angle measurement. There
are two different modes of contact angle: (1) static or equilibrium
CA is when the water droplet reaches equilibrium and thus will not
change over time, and (2) dynamic or hysteresis CA is when the water
droplet will change continuously as a function of time. The dynamic
wetting (contact angle), liquid penetration (volume), and spreading
are all measured as a function of time.

The strength of the
attractive or repellent force is closely related to the contact angle
between the water droplet and the surface. Characterizing the water
contact angle on a PVAm surface is very challenging due to its hydrophilicity
and water absorption potential. Macroscopic determination of hysteresis
contact angle was therefore performed in the wettability analysis:
The experimentally obtained contact angle of a drop placed on a PVAm
surface has a value ranging between the so-called advancing (maximum)
at the three-phase contact advancing angle, θA, to
the so-called receding (minimum) contact angle, θR at the contact line. When the receding angle is subtracted from
the advancing angle, the result is called the contact angle hysteresis,
θA – θR = Δθhyst. The Young equilibrium contact angle is somewhere between
those values, however, the microscopic behavior of contact angle from
the MD simulations may well represent the equilibrium contact angle,
hence the measurement-determined Δθhyst is
expected to be comparable with θSim.

3.4 Attraction Forces
A traditional way
to interpret the forces of the liquid–solid interface is to
apply Young’s law as a force balance of surface tensions. However,
to properly reach the equilibrium of the forces,49−51 it has been
demonstrated in the literature that the complete interpretation of
three forces exerted on the system is needed. (Consult the SI for further discussion on this force balance.)
Two forces are added: attractive force γliq sin θ,
which is called the reaction of the surface Rs, and the net repulsive force NetRF= γpol – γint, which also
acts in the contact line.

For a better understanding of the
wetting behavior of the PVAm surfaces, the microscopic interpretations
of wetting were taken into consideration. This can be modeled as two
parallel forces acting in the contact line52 liquid on solid γliq (1 + cos θ) and
solid on liquid γliq sin θ (see SI for full details).

3.4.1 Liquid
on Solid—Work of Adhesion
(Wadh)
The contact angle θ
values obtained for polymer–water systems were then used to
obtain the corresponding values of work of adhesion by means of the
Young–Dupré equation,53 see eq 10. 10  where γliq = 73 (mJ/m2) is the surface tension of water
from the literature.54

3.4.2 Solid on Liquid—The Net Normal Force
The main
reason for the existence of this force is the unbalanced
forces in the solid–liquid outside the droplet interface (see SI for full details). It originates from the
differences of the repulsive forces inside γpol +
γliq – γint and outside NetRF = γpol – γint of
the droplet, the unbalance of these forces is equal to γLV sin θ. This resulting net normal force
of the unbalance is called the reaction of the surface (Rs).52

3.5 Repulsive Forces
3.5.1 Liquid–Solid Interface
Surface Tension
(γint)
The Duprè equation was used
to calculate γint, as shown in eqs 11 and 12. The solid–liquid
surface tension represents the free energy needed to create a solid–liquid
interface. According to eq 2, the attraction of the solid–liquid interface reduces
the surface energy due to Wadh. 11   12  where Wadh is
work adhesion, γliq is surface tension of the liquid,
γpol is surface tension of the surface polymer, and
γint is the interfacial tension between them.

3.5.2 Net Repulsive Force
The repulsive
force γpol + γliq – γint is continuous along the surface and zero outside the droplet
(see SI for full details). To calculate
the net repulsive force between the subsystems, the attractive force
γliq was subtracted from the repulsive force γpol + γliq – γint yielding 13  

4 Results
and Discussion
The degree of hydrophilicity manipulation
of a given surface requires
understanding the microscale principles that, in turn, control the
macroscale surface-wetting behavior. Hence, understanding the structure
and performance of a common fluid such as water at the interface with
PVAm is of great and practical importance when, for instance, this
polymer is being used for separation of gas components present in
a humid flue gas.

4.1 Physical Properties
Intramolecular
interaction of PVAm at different pH values was studied by cohesive
energy density (ecoh), solubility parameter
(δ), and the chain packing density with the fractional free
volume (FFV). As is well known, thermophysical and mechanical properties
are directly related to the cohesive energy, and therefore they become
the first step of study.

Atomistic simulations were conducted
to calculate intramolecular forces within solid (PVAm) and liquid
(water) interfaces: polar interactions (van der Waals), ion–ion
(+ −), ion–dipole (H-bond), dipole–dipole, dipole-induced
dipole, and a-polar interactions (hydrophobic dispersion, coulomb
forces (Q)). The background theory for these simulations
is explained in paragraph 3.

The physical properties of PVAm
are given in Table 1. The fully protonated form of PVAm at pH
4 shows the lowest dispersive (vdW) and electrostatic (Q) intramolecular interactions, whilst the unprotonated form of PVAm
at pH 12 yields an almost two times increase in the vdW and Q interactions.
In the intermediate state, PVAm at pH 10 presents the largest interactions,
and hence highest values of ecoh, δ,
and FFV. Figure 2 shows
the pH response of different conformations of PVAm: the entangled
polymer chains at pH 4 are very tight and contracted due to the high
electrostatic repulsion of the H-bonding. Hence, at this pH, it is
a more fragile and more brittle polymer. In the case of pH 12, the
repulsions are low, yielding increased mobility and FFV. This leads
to an increased amorphous polymer structure. At the intermediate condition,
pH 10, the polymer chains are less entangled due to the balance between
the electrostatic forces and dispersion forces (ion–dipole,
H-bond). This consequently generates free space between the chains.
The repulsive interaction between PVAm protonated (pH = 4) and unprotonated
(pH = 12) thus turned out to be largely influenced by steric hindrance
of the protonated amine group.55

Figure 2 Snapshots of
the chains conformation of PVAm equilibrated from
MD simulations at pHs 4, 10 and 12. Orange atoms correspond to the
amine protonation.

This behavior of pH 10
PVAm could be explained due to the orientation
and the conformation packing density of the chain polymer, which allows
a very high strength of attractive and repulsive forces to form between
the protonated and unprotonated amine groups. There is a balance of
intermolecular forces at this pH that allows the strength and stability
of the polymer chain to increase. The steric hindrance, force balance,
and hydrogen bonding are the key factors for the PVAm microgel formation
and therefore the main factors for polymer stability.

Because
of the polyelectrolyte effect, as is well known, PVAm is
a highly cationic polyelectrolyte, which means that the oppositely
charged polymer sites attract one another and bind together. The intramolecular
interactions such as the cohesive energy density and solubility parameters
of PVAm are not linearly dependent on pH. However, the hydrogen bonding
is strongly dependent on the protonation state of the amine group.55 The intramolecular interactions of PVAm are
strongly influenced by the steric hindrance of the amine protonation
and the chain packing density caused by the attraction and repulsion
force balance of the protonated and unprotonated neighboring amine
groups.

To gain more information on the conformation of the
polymer chains,
the diameter sizes were quantified by considering the values of the
radius of gyration of the polymer structure; where the radius of gyration Rg is defined as the root mean square (RMS) distance
of the collection of atoms from their common center of gravity. Radius
of gyration of a polymer coil was calculated using the following equation. 14  where N is the number of atoms and x, y, and z are the atomic coordinates
relative to the center of mass.

It can thus be concluded that
the greater stability of PVAm at
pH 10 is due to the morphology blend of the partial amorphous region
and partial crystalline region, moreover, also to the steric hindrance
caused by the protonated state of PVAm and the chain packing density
caused by the attraction and repulsion force balance among the protonated
and unprotonated neighboring amine groups. These reasons play a critical
role in the morphology of the polymeric structure and consequently
in the stability and wetting behavior of PVAm.

Figure 4 shows X-ray
diffraction patterns obtained by molecular dynamic simulations. The
measurable scattering reflects the pattern of interference between
the scatterings from all of the atomic centers. At pH 10, the crystallinity
zones with very intensive diffraction peaks are arranged in a periodic
array, and the amorphous zone has a wide range curve. At pH 12, no
distinct diffraction peak can be detected, and the polymer conformation
is judged as amorphous. pH 4 shows a diffraction peak and narrow curve,
thus indicating crystalline and amorphous zones.

Figure 3 shows the
probability of polymeric chain distribution as a function of the radius
of gyration Rg based on molecular dynamic
simulations. For PVAm at pH 4, it is in the range of 11–17
Å with a very broad probability distribution. This indicates
that the polymeric chain has a wide range of polymeric conformations.
In the case of pH 10, a sharp localized peak is found with very high
probability at 15 Å, suggesting that there is one preferred polymer
chain conformation and therefore a more stable system. This could
be due to the steric hindrance for the partial amine protonated sites,
which has a high impact on the morphology of the PVAm chain and potentially
increases the degree of crystallinity. At pH 12, there is again a
broad probability distribution with different chain conformations
from 18.7 to 21 Å. This indicates a high degree of amorphous
region and low degree of crystallinity.

chain distribution in function of radii
of gyration—Rg.

4.2 Surface Properties
Intermolecular
interactions of PVAm at different pHs were studied by contact angle
θ, attraction forces (surface tension γliq and
γpol, work adhesion Wadh, and reaction from the surface Rs) and
repulsion forces (interface surface tension γint and
net repulsive force). PVAm exhibited three-stage wettability switching
from pH 4 (fully protonated), pH 10 (partial protonated), and pH 12 (unprotonated) (Figure 4).

Figure 4 X-ray diffraction structure
from MD simulations.

4.2.1 Fully Protonated PVAm Wettability
As
seen in Figure 5a,
the macroscopic behavior of water contact angle on the PVAm surface
at pH 4 shows high adsorption in a short time span, where the experimental
contact angle (CA) goes from θA = 70° to θR = 0° in 5 s. Therefore, there is no Δθhyst or swelling behavior at pH 4. It is also evident from Figure 5d that the baseline
remains constant over the time, which means that the surface of the
water droplet is not changing. This indicates that there is no water
spread on the polymeric surface, i.e., the water molecules are holding
together. The drop volume decreasing over the time, as seen in Figure 5g, means the attraction
forces as shown in Table 2 (Wadh = 106 mJ/m2 and Rs = 65 mJ/m2) are weaker than the
repulsive forces (γint = 37 mJ/m2 and
NetRF = 33 mJ/m2) at low pH. When the liquid
is on the solid, the adhesion is low (Wadh = 106 mJ/m2), and the main interaction is the unbalanced
force in the solid–liquid outside the droplet interface, where
the reaction of the surface at Rs = 65
mJ/m2 is very high. This can be explained because the water
molecules are attracted by the charge density of the surface and can
be absorbed easily on the surface.

forms very thin adsorbed layers. The main reason for the PVAm–water
adsorption at low pH 4 is due to the excess positive charge of the
polymer at this pH; hence, this causes a strong electrostatic interaction
with the negatively charged end of water (the oxygen atom). There
are weaker equilibrium forces, and the polymeric protonated state
at pH 4 provides a very high interfacial surface energy, γint = 37 mJ/m2. In this way, the high water adsorption
at low pH is due to excessive repulsive charge on the surface and
the high inter/intramolecular H-bonding between fully protonated groups.

The surface tension of PVAm at low pH (see Table 2, γpol = 70 mJ/m2) is close to the surface tension of water (γliq = 73 mJ/m2), and therefore the surface cannot break the
surface tension of the liquid and spread the water molecules. This
can be observed more clearly at a microscopic level in the equilibrium
contact angle from the MD simulations, as shown in Figure 6.

(top and side views) of the dynamics course

side, detailed view of PVAm at pH 10, orange atoms correspond to the
conformation of amine protonation.

4.2.2 Partial Protonation of PVAm Wettability
In the case of wettability, partial protonated PVAm shows a higher
resistance and therefore a decrease in hydrophilic behavior, as seen
in Figure 5b. For the
macroscopic level contact angle of PVAm at pH 10, it shows high stability.
The contact angle stays constant during the first 40 s, and then drops
to 67° as the swelling of the surface starts from 40 to 100 s,
before returning to 120°. The surface is showing contact angle
hysteresis, with an advancing angle θA = 112°,
retracting angle θR = 67°, and yielding Δθhyst = 45°. The partial protonated surface of PVAm shows
a high stability even in the swollen state.

In Figure 5e, the baseline increases with
time from 40 s, which means that the water droplet spreads on the
surface after 40 s, and the surface tension of water molecules was
overcome by the surface energy of PVAm (the droplet volume in Figure 5h, the first contact
shows stability, no water absorption up to 40 s). Then, water starts
absorbing and at the same time swelling the surface until 100 s. Table 2 shows the behavior
of water absorption on the PVAm surface, the high stability could
be explained by the balance of attraction forces γpol = 62 mJ/m2, Wadh = 122 mJ/m2, and Rs = 54 mJ/m2 and repulsive forces γint = 22 mJ/m2 and NetRF = 40 mJ/m2. Water is less attracted
by the charge density of the surface, even though there is adsorption
of water molecules on the surface. The equilibrium and the stability
in the contact line give the potential of swelling the polymer without
damaging the polymeric chain conformation. This indicates that the
high inter/intramolecular H-bonding between protonated and unprotonated
amine groups plays a critical role in the wettability of the PVAm
surface.

The partial protonated form of PVAm at pH 10 provides
a low interface
surface energy, γint = 22 mJ/m2. Hence,
lower water adsorption at high pH is due to the balance of attractive
forces and repulsive charge on the surface. The surface tension of
the polymer is lower, γpol = 62 mJ/m2,
than that of water, γliq = 73 mJ/m2, see Table 2, and the PVAm surface
can break the water surface tension, and therefore it can spread the
water molecules on the surface due to the partial charge density at
pH 10.

This behavior can also be seen in Figure 6 in the pictures of the dynamics of PVAm
at pH 10, showing how water is spreading on the PVAm surface in a
detailed view (top and side view). The distribution of the water molecules
and the charge density of the polymer chain stick together, forming
patterns as holes in structures on the surface. However, where the
surface has no charge, water can easily penetrate the chains of polymer
and fill the free volume and swell the polymer.

Water can penetrate
the polymer and untangle the polymer chains
due to the holding physical forces, and transform them from a static
solid state to a more viscous liquid state. The electrostatic interaction
is predominant, causing full dissociation of amine groups. The H-bonding
between protonated and unprotonated amine groups, the conformation
polymer chain, and the distribution charge density all play a crucial
role in the surface stability and wettability properties.

4.2.3 Unprotonated PVAm Wettability
The
wettability of unprotonated PVAm decreases the hydrophilic behavior,
as can be seen in Figure 5c where the macroscopic level contact angle of PVAm at pH
12 shows a lower stability up to 10 s. The hysteresis contact angle
of unprotonated PVAm at pH 12 varies from θA = 140°
down to θR = 98°, thus Δθhyst = 42°. In Figure 5f, the baseline increases as a function of time, meaning that the
water droplet is spreading on the surface within 10 s. The drop volume
in Figure 5i decreases,
indicating that the water absorption is fast, and starts to swell
the polymer.

Table 2 shows the attraction forces γpol = 60 mJ/m2, Wadh = 128 mJ/m2,
and Rs = 48 mJ/m2 and repulsive
forces γint = 5 mJ/m2 and NetRF = 55 mJ/m2. These forces are not in equilibrium, because
the attraction forces are higher at lower pH. This is due to the low
interface surface energy γint = 5 mJ/m2 and very low intermolecular interaction on the contact line. In
this case, PVAm is probably capable of interacting with water molecules
through hydrogen bonding, and at these conditions, this promotes water
spread. For PVAm at high pH, there are no electrostatic interactions;
the attraction contribution is from the dispersive vdW interactions. Figure 6 shows snapshots
of the dynamic simulations, a remarkable homogeneity of the water
molecules on the PVAm forms a flat surface of water molecules.

Up to this point, the horizontal attraction, Wadh, forces have been considered, however as discussed, Wadh forces are functions of the charge density
of the protonation of the amine groups. For high charge density and
low Wadh, it is, however, important to
consider the vertical attraction, as the reaction surface, Rs, goes down. At high charge density and high Rs, the attraction and repulsion forces of PVAm
at pH 10 are in equilibrium and hence more stable.

As can be
seen in Figure 7, another
factor, which helps to analyze the stability of
PVAm at different pH, is the time needed to identify the contact angle
equilibrium by molecular dynamic simulations. The equilibrium for
the contact angle at pH 4 and pH 12 takes longer, around 1100 ps to
reach equilibrium, whereas in the case of pH 10, it reaches equilibrium
faster after ca. 650 ps and remains constant.

12 by molecular dynamic simulations.

4.3 Structural Analysis—RDFs
As
already discussed, the formation of hydrogen bonds plays an important
role in the wettability properties of water on the PVAm surface. To
quantify intermolecular interactions and their contribution to the
structural properties of water, analysis of the radial distribution
function (RDF) is helpful to understand the microscopic behavior of
molecules for these interface systems. A series of RDFs are shown
in Figure 8. The appearance
of peaks in the radial distribution function is due to intermolecular
collisions or the repulsive forces arising inside.

Figure 8 RDFs of (a) pairwise
N(amine), H(amine) O(water), and H(water),
(b) N(amine), H(amine) O(water), H(water), and N(amine+), and (c) pairwise of N(amine), H(amine) O(water), and H(water).

Attractive forces are responsible
for a significant high density.
Moreover, as can be seen in the case of water, the existence of strong
and directional attractive forces (such as hydrogen bonding) can significantly
modify the structure of the peaks.

Figure 8a shows
the fully protonated amine (pH 4), where the attraction forces between
gN(amine)–O(water)(r) and hydrogen
bonding between amine–water have equal contributions in the
intermolecular interaction at short range. However, at long range,
the dispersive forces increase significantly. Figure 9 shows that the H(water)-bond acts as a donor
and the H(amine)-bond acts as an acceptor.

Figure 9 Hydrogen bond acceptor
and donor from amine protonated and unprotonated
with water.

In the case of partial
protonation, PVAm has three options for
hydrogen bonding, two from the protonated state and one from the unprotonated
state. In Figure 8b
the very large peak at 3 Å is due to the hydrogen bond between
gH(amine)–O(water)(r), corresponding
to the unprotonated state, where the H(water)-bond acts as electron
acceptor and the H(amine)-bond acts as electron donor. The high interaction
density of this hydrogen bond and the high intensity of interaction
are the main contributions to the stability of PVAm at pH 10.

The second peak at 3 Å at low intensity corresponds to the
attraction between gN(amine)–O(water)(r), whereas the third peak at 3.20 Å corresponds to the second
hydrogen bond from the unprotonated state gN(amine)–H(water)(r). In this unprotonated case, the H(water)-bond
acts as electron donor and the H(amine)-bond acts as electron acceptor,
see Figure 9.

The small peak at 3.5 Å corresponds to the third hydrogen
bond in the protonated state, likely in the crystalline region of
the linear polymer chains, which are structurally oriented in a uniform
three-dimensional matrix, gN(amine+)–H(water)(r). This shows very low interaction at short range (Q) but very high contribution in the long range (vdW). This
is due to the H(water)-bond acting as an electron donor and N(amine)-bond
acting as electron acceptor.

The high stability of PVAm at pH
10 occurs because the hydrogen
bond becomes collectively stronger due to the many molecules bounded,
and the great solubility corresponds to the hydrogen bond between
gH(amine)–O(water)(r) from the
unprotonated state and to the overall stiffness of the structure.
The interchain hydrogen bonding between the amine–water could
also enhance the stiffness. The PVAm molecules align themselves side
by side into hydrocarbons that are stabilized by interchain hydrogen
bonding with water.

Moreover, the gH(water)–N(amine +) bond
likely acts as a physical crosslink through the interchain polymer
conformation at the protonation state, see Figure 10; this H-bonding gH(water)–N(amine +) enhances the crystallinity and increases dramatically the inter-laminar
space of the crystalline zone, thus reducing the interchain free space
and increasing the interaction between amorphous and crystalline interchains.
This makes the polymer more mechanically resistant and therefore more
stable; moreover, the strong inter/intramolecular forces in the short
(electrostatic forces) and large range (dispersion forces) also play
an important role in the interactions.

Figure 10 (a) Sketch of crystalline
and amorphous polymer states at different
pHs, (b) sketch of inter/intramolecules of crystalline and amorphous
PVAm with water molecules, and (c) hydrogen bond between water–amine
protonated acts as physical crosslink.

The unprotonated state of PVAm in Figure 8c shows less interaction with water molecules.
Both hydrogen bonds are in the same low range of interaction, the
peak at 3 Å corresponds to the attraction between gN(amine)–O(water)(r), the second peak at 3 Å corresponds to
the gH(amine)–O(water)(r), wherein
the H(water)-bond acts as acceptor and the H(amine)-bond acts as donor.
The third peak at 2.2 Å corresponds to the second hydrogen bonding
gN(amine)–H(water)(r), but in this
case, the H(water)-bond acts as donor and the H(amine)-bond acts as
acceptor.

4.4 Binding Energies
To analyze the intermolecular
interactions between PVAm/water, binding energy simulations were performed
by molecular dynamic simulations in the canonical (NVT) ensemble and were run at T = 298 K. From the equilibrated
part of the MD trajectory of each PVAm system, the interaction energies
among all system components were extracted according to a well-validated
procedure.59 Because, by definition, the
binding energy (Ebind) between each generic
pair of PVAm system components (PVAm) and water is the negative of
the corresponding interaction energy, each Ebind term can simply be obtained from the corresponding interaction
energies as shown in eq 15(59) 15  Interaction energy terms between the polymer
and water, Ebind(PVAm/H2O),
increase when protonation decreases. Generally, water molecules preferably
interact more when the amine is unprotonated, by virtue of strong
Coulombic attraction between the water dipoles and amine group. The
more protonated form of the PVAm surface possesses the potential to
realize larger segment/PVAm surface contacts, which favors surface
adsorption and, ultimately, results in the highest level of polymer
interaction with water.

As can be seen in Table 3, pH 4 presents the lowest interaction; the
Coulombic forces are predominant due to the charge density of PVAm.
The conformation of the protonated polymer and the rigidity of the
chain polymer reduce the interaction space between amine groups and
water.

Table 3 Binding
Energies from Water on PVAm (Ebind(PVAm/H2O)) at Different pHs: 4,10, and 12a
energy	pH 4	pH 10	pH 12	
potential	–994	–2615	–2323	
vdW	–215	–78	–150	
coulomb	–779	–2537	–2173	
a All energies are in kcal/mol.

For pH 10 and pH 12, the potential energies are almost
three times
higher due to the free space formed in untangled polymer conformation.
However, pH 10 presents the highest interaction energy, due to the
high FFV of the chain polymer conformation and the mobility of the
unprotonated amine groups. Thermodynamic arguments can be invoked
to account for this trend. Indeed, it can be argued that PVAm would
generally adopt a conformation that allows for maximum segment-surface
interactions.

H-bonding between gH(water)–N(amine +)(r) acts as a physical crosslinker between the polymer
chains,
giving greater rigidity and strength to the polymer matrix.

4.5 Swelling Properties
Figure 11 shows the swelling kinetics
of PVAm samples a, b, and c at room temperature, over different saturated
salt solutions (yielding a defined and constant relativity humidity
RH%). Figure 11d–f
shows the samples with different pHs. Generally, the swelling degree
(SD%) behavior increases when the RH% increases; this effect is governed
by the effect of intra-chain hydrogen bonding on crystallinity zone
of PVAm. At pH 4, there is full protonation (high content of crystalline
zone), and at pH 10 and partial protonation (crystalline and amorphous
zones), there is a high capacity for swelling the polymer chain, whereas
at pH 12, there is the lowest capacity. Another interesting point
of the swelling kinetics is the time to reach the equilibrium. At
pH 4 and 12, it takes about 100 h before the equilibrium at different
RH% is reached.

Figure 11 Swelling kinetics of PVAm samples a, b, and c at room
temperature
in different salt solutions (relativity humidity RH%). d, e, and f
samples with different pHs.

However, at pH 10, a plateau is reached after about 100 h
followed
by a slow almost linear increase before reaching the equilibrium at
850 h. This reflects the greater stability of the polymer due to the
effect of intra-chain hydrogen bonding on the crystallinity zone of
PVAm and the physical crosslinked effect of H-bond (water) and given
amine protonation.

The 37% swelling degree at pH 10 reflects
the ability of the polar
groups to interact with water molecules in this conformation of the
polymer matrix. This is due to the physicochemical affinity of the
polymer group to water, the free space available in the vicinity of
the sites, as well as the local elastic resistance of the chains to
swelling deformation stress.60

Water
penetration is different in the three pH levels of PVAm measured,
and it depends on the hydrogen bond formation. The PVAm conformation
is pH driven, from amorphous to crystalline state.

At pH 4,
the polymer matrix presents more crystalline regions that
cannot arrange themselves as freely as those of pH 10 and 12, which
present more amorphous regions. The principal factor affecting the
crystallization is the polarity of the molecules, which increases
the attraction between adjacent chains, and hence induces the crystallization.

As seen in Figure 12, PVAm surface properties are a function of the protonation state;
at high protonation degree: much hydrogen bonding and large vdW forces
are increasing the intramolecular interactions between PVAm and water.
The wettability behavior of the PVAm surface is hence also a function
of pH.

of PVAm at different protonation: contact angle “CA”
(deg), surface tension “ST” (mJ/m2), hydrophilicity
“HF”, and swollen “SW” for water in contact
with a PVAm surface at different pHs.

5 Conclusions
In the current work, the
wettability properties of PVAm cast from
solutions of different pHs have been documented, both by experimental
and molecular dynamic simulations, confirming that the intramolecular
interactions such as the cohesive energy density (echo) and solubility
parameters of PVAm are pH-dependent.

It was found that the high
stability of pH 10 polymer is due to
the orientation and the conformation of the packing density of the
polymer chain, which allow a very high strength of attractive and
repulsion forces to be formed between the protonated and unprotonated
amine groups. There exists a balance of intermolecular forces that
allows the strength and stability of the polymer chains to be increased.
The steric hindrance, force balance, and hydrogen bonding are all
key factors with respect to the PVAm microgel formation, and therefore,
they are the main factors for polymer stability. This work confirms
by structural analysis of RDFs that the high stability of PVAm at
pH 10 is because the hydrogen bond becomes very strong because many
molecules are bound, inducing stiffness to the overall polymeric matrix.
The high water solubility corresponds to the hydrogen bond between
gH(amine)–O(water)(r) from the
unprotonated state.

The intramolecular interactions of PVAm
(for any investigated pH)
are strongly influenced by the steric hindrance of the amine protonation
and the chain packing density caused by the attraction and repulsion
force balance of the protonated and unprotonated neighboring amine
groups.

The high inter/intramolecular H-bonding between protonated
and
unprotonated amine groups, the conformation polymer chain, and the
distribution charge density play a crucial role in the surface stability
and wettability properties.

PVAm in a charged state is not surface
active, as it reduces the
mobility of the amine groups. When the surface is unprotonated, it
is more surface active, experiencing more mobility of the amine groups.
In the case of the partial charge state, both features combine giving
enough strength and mobility to swell the polymer and the capability
of being more stable.

This work confirms that PVAm is pH dependent
of the surface tension,
reflecting the dissociation behavior of the amine group exploiting
the concomitant swelling (charged state) and partial collapse (neutral
state). PVAm at pH 4 and 12 shows the typical behavior of a linear
polymer, whereas at pH 10, it behaves as a microgel. A balance occurring
at pH 10 of PVAm between the attraction and repulsion forces of water
on PVAm surfaces helps to maintain the stability of the membrane for
CO2 transport.

Moreover, the gH(water)–N(amine +) bond
likely acts as a physical crosslinker through the interchain polymer
conformation in the protonated state. These H-bonds enhance the crystallinity
and dramatically increase the inter-laminar space of the crystalline
zone, reducing the interchain free space and increasing the interaction
between amorphous and crystalline regions, making it more mechanically
resistive and therefore more stable. Moreover, the strong inter/intramolecular
forces in the short range (electrostatic forces) and large range (dispersion
forces) also play an important role in the interactions. The surface
properties and the degree of swelling can therefore all be tuned via
the adjustment of the pH.
