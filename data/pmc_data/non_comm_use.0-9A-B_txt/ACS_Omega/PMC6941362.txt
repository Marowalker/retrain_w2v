Contamination of honey with toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids
(PAs)
and their N-oxides (PANOs) was assessed by dilution with acidic methanol
and analysis through liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem
mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in three different modes. The hybrid linear
trap/triple quadrupole (LC-QTRAP) instrument was used in precursor
ion scan (PIS), enhanced product ion scan (EPI), and multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode. The parent ions from ions at m/z 120 or 138 amus, characteristic of all the toxic
PAs and PANOs in the sample were first scanned by PIS. Then, the presence
of each contaminant at specific retention times through its MS2 spectrum was confirmed by EPI. Finally, they were quantified
in the MRM mode. The method was validated: recoveries 86–111%,
relative standard deviation (RSD) <20%, at 20 and 40 μg/kg,
except retrorsine, which showed a RSD of 30% at 20 μg/kg. Honey
samples were analyzed and five of them showed levels of 40 μg/kg
for the sum (PAs + PANOs). This approach allows the simultaneous determination
of PAs and PANOs in honey, even if their chemical standards are not
available.

==== Body
Introduction
Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are a large
group of secondary metabolites
occurring in Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Boraginaceae species. Their
basic cores are the necines platynecine, heliotridine, retronecine,
and otonecine. They are esters that occur in nature in two forms:
the tertiary form and its corresponding N-oxides (PANOs). PAs bearing
a 1,2 unsaturation in the necine are hepatotoxic, carcinogenic, genotoxic,
teratogenic, and sometimes pneumotoxic.1 The toxicity of unsaturated necines follows the following sequence:
macrocyclic, diesters, and monoesters.2

The increasing reports on PA contamination of foods such as
grain,
milk, meat, eggs, or honey, stress the importance of performing a
risk assessment on these alkaloids.3 The
main drawback to gather enough data for this study is the lack of
appropriate analytical methods to determine them in the different
food matrices. This issue has been acknowledged by the Joint FAO/WHO
for food standards program of the Codex Alimentarius Commission.3 Simultaneously, the Panel on Contaminants in
the Food Chain (CONTAM Panel) from the European Food Safety Authority
(EFSA) stressed the need to generate knowledge about exposure to PAs,
in particular due to honey consumption.4 Honey has shown to be a considerable source of PA exposure. The
contamination may be due to nectar and plant pollen rich in PAs collected
by bees and transferred to honey.5

There is no legal requirement of maximum levels for these natural
toxins occurring in honey, bee pollen, and other foodstuffs. Nevertheless,
some European countries have introduced acceptable tolerance levels
for PAs in herbal preparations and extracts, and these have been applied
to the commerce of honey. Germany has introduced a limit of 1 μg
of PAs per day for phytopharmaceuticals when consumed during less
than 6 weeks and 0.1 μg of PAs per day if the 6-week period
of application is exceeded.6

In 2017,
the Federal Institute of Risk Assessment (Bundesinstitut
für Risikobewertung, BfR, Germany) and the UK Committee on
Toxicity (COT) has recommended an exposure limit from different foods
of 0.007 μg of PAs/kg body weight per day, which corresponds
to 0.49 μg per day of PAs for an average 70 kg person.7,8 Then, the CONTAM Panel established a revised value of 237 μg/kg
body weight per day that has been adopted by the BfR.9

Several methods have been developed for the determination
of PAs
in honey. In 2008, Kempf et al developed a method by gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry (GC-MS) that quantifies PAs as a sum parameter after
reducing the esters to retronecine.10 This
method was applied to the determination of PAs in honeys used for
medicinal purposes;11 in 2018, Kowalczyk
et al employed the same strategy and a clean up by solid phase extraction
(SPE) where different sorbents and eluents were tested, achieving
a very low limit of quantification.12

PAs determination evolved from GC-MS to LC-MS methods. This happened
because GC methods are applicable only to free bases given that the
N-oxides are not stable at the temperatures required for volatilization.
On the other hand, LC methods have the advantage that both, bases
and PANOs, can be analyzed simultaneously. Liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (LC-MS) prevents the thermal decomposition of N-oxides
and offers important structural information, as PAs are more toxic
than PANOs. Most of the LC methods developed for PA determination
in honey rely on SPE employing a strong cation exchange resin as sample
treatment.13−21 The recoveries of PAs from samples are highly dependent on the types
of cartridges, sample loading amount, and eluents used during the
extraction procedures. Other methods for the determination of trace
contaminants have been assayed such as Quick Easy Cheap Effective
Rugged Safe (QuEChERS) template.22 However,
a robust method for the simultaneous determination of PAs and PANOs
in honey is lacking. QuEChERS is a method originally developed for
the multiresidue analysis of pesticides in a wide range of matrices.
When it was applied for PA determination, the N-oxides had to be reduced
with zinc dust and allowed to react for 1 h and 30 min.23

The variant of QuEChERS, Quick Polar Pesticides
(QuPPe) is a method
developed to determine highly polar pesticides that are not amenable
QuEChERS. Up to now, it had not been assayed for the simultaneous
determination of PAs and PANOs. The procedure simply involves addition
of acidified methanol–water mixture and isotopically labeled
standards. The compounds are extracted from the test portion via shaking.
After centrifugation, an aliquot of the raw extract could be further
cleaned up or analyzed as such by LC-MS/MS.

Tandem hybrid mass
spectrometers like Q-traps can work in several
operating modes where each of them gives specific structural information,
including precursor ion scan (PIS), enhanced product ion (EPI), and
multireaction monitoring (MRM) mode. During PIS, all the ions that
give rise to a daughter ion of a specific m/z are selected and registered. When using EPI, the ions
of specific m/z are selected, fragmented,
and driven to the detector focused at the desired mass range, giving
the MS2 spectra. The MRM approach allows monitoring several
transitions of parent ions to daughter ions; this is the golden standard
for trace quantification purposes (Table 1).

The present work introduces a protocol for the determination
of
PAs and PANOs in honey. For most of these compounds, standards are
not commercially available yet, so the goal of this protocol is to
identify and quantify the most toxic PAs, even when analytical standards
are not available.

Results and Discussion
Selection of Sample Treatment
Sample treatment is generally
a laborious and time-consuming step that contributes mostly to analytical
errors. To simplify PA analysis in honey, two strategies that have
proven to be efficient for trace analysis of organic contaminants
were considered, QuEChERS and QuPPe.

The recoveries obtained
through QuEChERS procedure with a spiked honey were around 100% for
the bases but 50% for echimidine N-oxide. In an attempt to improve
the N-oxide recovery, 2 g of NaCl was used to increase the salting
out effect, but recoveries were not affected. Hence, to recover N-oxides
a reduction step is needed, which is troublesome, and therefore the
QuEChERS approach was discarded.

QuPPe was tested because it
was designed for the determination
of polar pesticides residues. Sample dilution with MeOH in acidic
media succeeded in recovering both free bases and N-oxides with high
percentages and low dispersion. MeOH precipitates the sugars but keeps
the target compounds in solution. In its protocol, QuPPe stresses
the relevance of using isotopically labeled standards for quantification.
In this case, as labeled standards were not available, the conventional
approach in the trace analysis of matrix-matched calibration was employed
to identify and determine the studied compounds during method evaluation.
The uncertainty added by the impossibility of use was evaluated as
tolerable for this particular case. Due to the precision and accuracy
that QuPPE showed in the trial assays, it was selected as the sample
treatment technique. In a single step, it allows the total analysis
of the molecular species of PAs present in the sample in trace amounts.
The method’s performance characteristics are shown below.

LC-MS/MS Workflow
Precursor ion scan (PIS) and enhanced
product ion scan modes were executed to identify the compounds. Scheduled
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode was applied to quantify them.

Precursor ion scanmode can be used to detect all ions that give
rise to a daughter ion of a specific m/z. Toxic and consequently relevant for health, alkaloids contain a
1,2 unsaturated pyrrolizidine nucleus, which yields a characteristic
ion at m/z 120 in the case of open-chain
mono- and diesters, cyclic diesters, open-chain diester, and cyclic
diester N-oxides, and a characteristic ion at m/z 138 in the case of open-chain monoester N-oxides.24 Monitoring all the parent ions that have a daughter
ion at m/z 120 or 138 allows detecting
all PAs contained in a sample whether their standards are available
or not. Figure 1 shows
the precursor ion spectrum of a honey sample for the daughter ion
of m/z 138.

Figure 1 PIS spectrum of m/z 138.

Once this experiment reveals possible parent ions,
it is necessary
to confirm if they are PAs. At this step, an enhanced product ion
(EPI) experiment is performed. The ions of specific m/z are selected at Q1 and collected in the collision
cell where they are fragmented and driven to the detector, giving
a MS2 spectrum that provides the structural information
needed to unequivocally identify the compound (Figure 2).

Figure 2 EPI obtained for the compound of m/z 300.4.

The presence of the ions of m/z 120, 138, 156, 172, and 220 reveals the presence of lycopsamine.

Afterward, the compounds are quantified by multireaction monitoring
protocol using two ions, a qualifier that corresponds to the daughter
ion giving the less intense signal and the most intense one, the quantifier
(Figure 3).25

Figure 3 MRM transitions employed for lycopsamine N-oxide quantification m/z 138 qualifier (red) and m/z 120 quantifier (blue).

The results are expressed as acetyllycopsamine
for the open esters,
retrorsine for the cyclic esters, and echimidine N-oxide for the N-oxides,
using a five-point matrix-matched calibration curve of acetyllycopsamine,
retrorsine, and echimidine N-oxide, respectively.

Since there
are more than 300 PAs reported and only a few standards
are commercially available, this approach is of utmost relevance.

Method’s Performance Characteristics
The following
performance characteristics were evaluated:

Linearity was evaluated
through a matrix-matched five-point calibration curve in the range
of 3.8–20 μg/L for acetyllycopsamine, 18–126 μg/L
for retrorsine, and 5.6–29.8 μg/L for echimidine N-oxide.
A linear calibration function, a = 12819995C-8172, R2 = 0.993; a = 1260294C-8580, R2 = 0.9949; and a = 7898688C-24203, R2 = 0.9934, where “a” is area and “C” the concentration
in μg/L was found to fit the experimental data for acetyllycopsamine,
retrorsine, and echimidine N-oxide, respectively.

Precision
(repeatability) was evaluated at two levels by repeating
five times the entire procedure in a honey sample with no detectable
amounts of PAs, so it was spiked at the 20 and 40 μg/kg of honey
level. The relative standard deviations are shown in Table 2. A standardized alkaloid extract
of Echium plantagineum(26) was employed to spike the sample to evaluate the repeatability
for echiumine and echimidine. The values of sr (%) were
5.8 and 6.1, respectively (the amount of echiumine and echimidine
added was 21.8 and 21.4 μg/kg of honey, respectively).

Table 2 Precision (repeatability) Estimated
as sr (%)
compound	sr (%)	μg/kg of added to honey	
Low Level	
acetyllicopsamine	5.4	16.5	
echimidine N-oxide	6.3	23.0	
retrorsine	31	21.9	
senecionine	11	20.0	
seneciphylline	3.3	16.5	
Mid-Level	
acetyllicopsamine	20	33.0	
echimidine N
oxide	15	46.0	
retrorsine	18	43.8	
senecionine	6.7	40.0	
seneciphylline	7.8	33.0	
Quantification limits were assessed according the
Eurachem criteria27 employing the standard
deviation of the results
obtained for each compound (n = 5) at the low concentration
level. The LOQs were 8.6, 13.0, and 18.4 μg/kg in honey for
acetyllicopsamine, echimidine N-oxide, and retrorsine, respectively.

Evaluation of Matrix Effect
Matrix effects for the
specific standards used for quantitation were evaluated comparing
the response from standards in MeOH with that from the standards in
the extract.25 An open-chain diester (acetillicopsamine)
a macrocyclic diester (retrorsine) and an N-oxide (echimidine N-oxide)
were employed. The matrix effects calculated as the relative difference
in percentage between the slopes of the curves obtained in the extract
and in MeOH were 213, 438, and 108%; hence, matrix-matched calibrations
were performed.

Trueness
Trueness was assessed by spike recoveries
(n = 5) at 20 and 40 μg/kg of honey levels.

The average recovery percentage for each compound is presented
in Table 3.

Table 3 Trueness Evaluated as Recovery Percentage
compound	average recovery (%)	
Low Level	
acetyllicopsamine	95.8	
echimidine N-oxide	90.7	
retrorsine	86.4

Mid-level	
acetyllicopsamine	96.4	
echimidine N-oxide	111	
retrorsine	103	
senecionine	88.7	
seneciphylline	89.9	
The recoveries obtained for echimidine and echiumine
were 86.3
and 92.5%, respectively.

PA Determination in Commercial Honey Samples
Five honey
samples were analyzed in duplicates, and the results are presented
in Table 4.

a Echiu: echiumine, Echim: echimidine,
Lyc: lycopsamine, Lyc N-ox, lycopsamine N-oxide, and AcLyc: acetyllycopsamine.

Senecionine was detected in samples 1 and 5, but it
was below its
limit of quantification.

The combination of different strategies
and operational modes of
LC-MS/MS allowed the determination of several PAs and PANOs in honey
without employing individual standards. An “in house”
standard can be built up with this protocol, which is useful for further
analysis and method development.

The LC-MS/MS proposed protocol
is generally applicable for the
characterization of families of compounds in extracts that bear common
structural features such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids. The PIS mode
available on hybrid linear trap/ triple quadrupole (QTRAP) LC-MS/MS
configurations allowed detecting every compound that has an m/z 120 or 138 daughter ion. Then, the
presence of PAs was confirmed through their MS2 spectrum
obtained by enhanced product ion scan using the linear trap. Finally,
compound quantitation was performed with high sensibility and selectivity
through target analysis acquired in the MRM mode.

The method
may seem laborious at first glance, but the possibility
of expanding it to new PA findings in honey is one of its major features
and advantages. Its target is not a closed list of compounds but an
open one. In the absence of a PA standard, the MS2 spectrum
is the definitive tool to identify the unknown. Nevertheless, careful
inspection has to be done to not inform false positives. The very
low LOQs reached allow accomplishing the concepts of consumers′
food safety.

Materials and Methods
All Chemicals Employed Were High-Performance Liquid Chromatography
(HPLC) orP.A. Grade
PA standards (acetyllycopsamine, echimidine
N-oxide, senecionine, and seneciphylline) were purchased from Phytolab
GMBH (Vestenbergsgreuth, Germany), and retrorsine was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim, Germany). Echiumine and echimidine were
obtained from a characterized (LC–(electrospray ionization
(ESI))MS/MS) extract of Echium plantagineum L. prepared as described before.26

Stock solutions of the pure standards of 500–5000 mg/L were
prepared in acetonitrile. The solutions were stored at −18
°C, and the working standards were prepared daily.

Samples
of raw honey were taken directly from the producer and
stored at ambient temperature.

Equipment
A 1200 Infinity (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara) high-pressure liquid chromatograph fitted with a ZORBAX Eclipse
XDB C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm2, 5 μm) and coupled
to a 4000 QTRAP system (AB Sciex, Ontario, Canada) equipped with an
electrospray (ESI) source was employed to perform LC/MS-MS analysis.

Sample Preparation
QuEChERS
Ten milliliters of water and 10 mL of acetonitrile
were added to 5 g of sample and shaken by hand. Then, 4 g of MgSO4 and 1 g of NaCl were added under vigorous shaking (1 min).
After centrifugation (5 min, 3500 rpm) and filtration, an aliquot
was analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

QuPPe
Five grams of honey was dissolved in 10 mL of
water under vigorous manual shaking for 1 min. Ten milliters of 1%
(v/v) formic acid in MeOH was added, and the mixture was shaken vigorously
for another min. Following centrifugation (5 min, 3500 rpm), the supernatant
was filtered and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.

LC Analysis
The mobile phase was composed of (A) 0.1%
formic acid in water and (B) acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min.
The LC conditions were same as those described previously based on
the protocol from Avula et al.28 with some
modifications. The elution gradient was 0 min, 87% A/13% B isocratic
for 1 min, in next 7 min to 50% A/50% B, and in next 7 min to 100%
B. Each run was followed by a 3 min equilibration period with 87%
A/13% B. The injection volume was 10 μL.

MS/MS
The ESI source was operated in a positive-ion
mode with a capillary voltage of 3500 V and air as the nebulizer gas
(70 psi), as well as the drying gas (dry air at 350 °C/50 psi).
The curtain gas was N2 (30 psi). The operating conditions
were optimized with pure standards and with characterized extract.

PIS was performed employing a declustering potential (DP) ramp
from 50 to 120 V and a collision energy (CE) ramp from 13 to 60 KeV.

The optimized conditions for EPI experiment and MRM of the known
compounds are shown in Table 1.

For others compounds identified as possible PAs, DP
and CE employed
for tertiary bases either for EPI experiment or for their quantification
by MRM was 60 V and 35 keV, respectively (average of DP and CE of
the known compounds). DP employed for N-oxides was 80 V.
