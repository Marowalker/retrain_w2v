Binding effect and interaction of N,N′-dialkyl cystine based gemini surfactant (GS);
2(C12Cys) with human serum albumin (HSA) were systematically
investigated
by the techniques such as surface tension measurement, UV−visible
spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy,
and molecular docking studies. The surface tension measurement exhibited
that HSA shifted the critical micelle concentration of the 2(C12Cys) GS to the higher side that confirms the complex formation
among 2(C12Cys) GS and HSA which was also verified by UV–visible,
fluorescence, and CD spectroscopy. Increase in the concentration of
2(C12Cys) GS increases the absorption of the HSA protein
but has a reverse effect on the fluorescence intensity. The analysis
of UV–visible study with the help of a static quenching method
showed that the value acquired for the bimolecular quenching constant
(kq) quenches the intrinsic fluorescence
of the HSA protein. Synchronous fluorescence spectrometry declared
that the induced-binding conformational changes in HSA and CD results
explained the variations in the secondary arrangement of the protein
in presence of 2(C12Cys) GS. The present study revealed
that the interaction between 2(C12Cys) GS and HSA is important
for the preparation and properties of medicines. Molecular docking
study provides insight into the specific binding site of 2(C12Cys) GS into the sites of HSA.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Proteins are most critical
constituents of life that plays an important
role in living species and have a tendency to combine with inorganic/organic
moieties, for example, fatty acids, hematin, bilirubin, surfactants,
metal ions, and drugs.1−7 The interaction of protein–surfactant played a vital role
in a broad variety of industrial aspects, for example, biotechnological
and biosciences processes, gene delivery, drug delivery, coatings,
cosmetics, food industry, and production of pharmaceutical materials
such as blood serum, a blend of human serum albumin (HSA) with an
integer of compounds, comprising small molecular surface-active molecules.
The surface tension of such biological fluids is used as a diagnostic
and therapeutic device.8

Proteins
are the active components in the area of medicine because
they have an affinity to bind various molecules along with the ability
to catalyze various biochemical reactions, viz., superoxide dismutase.9 They also form protein–surfactant complexes
by adhering to various surfactant molecules, in which the hydrophobic
parts of the surfactant molecules tend to bind with the interior of
the hydrophobic residues of proteins.10,11 Therefore,
an understanding of such phenomena could be helpful in evaluating
the effect of surfactants on protein denaturation, solubilization,
and renaturation processes.12−14 On the other hand, protein aggregation
considered as an important phenomenon, which can be responsible for
various human diseases and often viewed as an undesired effect in
the field of pharmacy.15−19 The molecular mechanism of protein aggregation is still not interpreted,
posing a challenge to researchers.20

Literature reports reveal that there are relatively few scientific
reports concerning the interaction of proteins with a novel class
of dicationic amphiphilic compounds. They are termed as gemini surfactants
(GSs) consisting of two polar groups and two hydrophobic chains. They
display higher surface activity, better solubility, and capability
of foaming in comparison to conventional surfactants.21−23 The properties of various structural forms of GSs can be adjusted
depending on the length of the hydrophobic chains and the distance
between the polar groups, in addition to their overall chemical structure.
Typically, much lower concentrations of GSs are required to perform
the desired function, concluding to their limited impact on the environment.24 In water, GSs form structures similar to the
structure of the biological membrane, additionally diminishing the
possible toxicity on the human body in medicinal applications.25,26 Hence, these GSs are considered as a motivating group of surfactants
because of their other unusual properties, as compared to their conventional
surfactant homologs.27,28

HSA consists of 585 amino
acid units (in a particular polypeptide
chain) and large cysteine content. HSA is a moving protein, having
a molecular weight of ∼66 kDa available in blood plasma, playing
an important role in binding with several exogenous and endogenous
compounds in the human body.29,30 HSA, having a single
amino acid unit (tryptophan; Trp 214), was investigated by intrinsic
fluorescence. Three α-helical domains (I, II, and III) are present
in the HSA structure31 that supports to
maintain the colloidal blood pressure and pH of the plasma.32 Numerous ligands bind to serum albumins and
therefore, act as model proteins to investigate biophysical and biochemical
properties.33

Many researchers report
that serum albumins have a similarity to
various biologically energetic compounds such as drugs, metabolites,
and so forth, which control their metabolism in blood.34,35 The folding and unfolding determines the interaction and binding
of HSA with amphiphilic molecules by its concentration and the surfactant
concentration that has been used.36,37 It is significant
to investigate the binding procedure carefully to find out the binding
parameters, number of binding sites and the energetics involved for
evaluating the sharing and efficiency of the ligand.

The aim
of our work was to find out the substantial molecular interaction
between an amino acid-based GS derived from cystine, N,N′-dialkyl cystine 2(C12Cys)
GS with HSA, which form protein–surfactant complexes. This
particular HSA protein was chosen because of its pharmaceutical and
physiological properties. Based on the surveys undertaken, the present
study is an endeavor to describe the effect of hydrophobicity on the
protein conformation and stability.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 cmc and Interfacial Adsorption
Surface
tensiometry is considered an easy and effectual measurement to expose
the macromolecule/surfactant interactions. The representative surface
tension versus log surfactant concentration plotted for 2(C12Cys) GS in the absence and presence of HSA are shown in Figure 1. At small concentrations,
the molecules of the surfactant adsorb at the air/liquid interface
until the liquid surface is fully occupied. Additionally, when the
excess molecules tend to self-associate in the solution to form micelles,
the surface tension becomes constant. In the presence of phosphate
buffer, the critical micelle concentration (cmc) value of 2(C12Cys) GS is smaller than the cmc (0.00109 mM) value acquired
in the aqueous medium38 and is because
of the high ionic environment exerted by the phosphate buffer. It
has been found (Figure 1) that in the presence of HSA, the smaller value of cmc of 2(C12Cys) GS specify the interaction among HSA and 2(C12Cys) GS. It may be because of the presence of overall negative charge
on the HSA protein at a particular pH of 7.4 and this negative charge
controls the electrostatic repulsions between the head groups of 2(C12Cys) monomers, which in turn support aggregation of surfactant
molecules. Furthermore, cation−π interactions (among
protein aromatic parts and head groups of surfactants) and hydrophilic/hydrophobic
contributions have also been reported for cmc decrease.39

Figure 1 Surface tension profile of 2(C12Cys) GS in
the absence
and presence of 4 μM HSA in buffer solution (pH 7.4).

To give more insights into 2(C12Cys)
GS + HSA interaction,
interfacial parameters at the air/liquid interface and the resulted
parameters are given in Table 1. ∏cmc (surface pressure) were calculated
by employing the equation 1  where γ0 and γcmc stand for the solvent and the mixture surface tension at
the cmc, respectively.

HSA (Aqueous Solution, pH 7.4) at 25 °C
sample	cmc (mM)	γcmc (mN/m−1)	∏cmc (mN/m−1)	Γmax (107 × mol/m−2)	Amin (Å2)	ΔGmic° (kJ/mol−1)	ΔGads° (kJ/mol−1)	
2(C12Cys)	0.0011	35.14	35.86	18.01	92.18	–27.28	–29.27	
2(C12Cys) + HSA	0.00087	41.08	29.92	20.26	81.93	–27.87	–29.35	
The reducing and rising values of γcmc and ∏cmc in mixed systems specify that the efficacy
of the system
rises as shown in Table 1. The Γmax (Gibbs surface excess concentration)
was evaluated by applying the equation40 2  where R and T are the universal gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) and temperature in kelvin, respectively. The prefactor n is the species number at the air/liquid interface and n = 1 (because of swamping quantity of the electrolyte).41,42 It is found from Table 1 that in the presence of HSA, the concentration of surface
excess is enhanced. This means that many 2(C12Cys) molecules
get adsorbed at the surface interface. The minimum values of the surface
area per molecule (Amin) calculated by
employing the equation 3  where NA is the
Avogadro’s number (6.023 × 1023 mol–1) were established to reduce in the presence of HSA, which supports
the concept that sites of negatively charged or negatively charged
amino acid residues on HSA possess more electrostatic repulsions between
the head groups. This implies the efficiency and denseness of 2(C12Cys) monomers to occupy the interface. The micellization
and adsorption Gibbs free energy change were calculated by using equations.43,44 4   5  where Xcmc is
the cmc of the mixture of the two components at a given mole fraction.

The standard free energies (ΔGmic° and ΔGads°) are commonly used to examine whether the adsorption at the air/liquid
interface and the micellization in solution is enhanced. The ΔGmic° and ΔGads° values for 2(C12Cys) GS +
HSA and alone 2(C12Cys) GS are given in Table 1. The negative values of both
ΔGmic° and ΔGads° indicate
that the absolute values for 2(C12Cys) GS + HSA are higher
than those for 2(C12Cys) GS alone. In both the cases, the
values for adsorption are also significantly higher than those for
micellization (Table 1). It could be inferred that adsorption at the air/liquid interface
is more than the micellization in solution and 2(C12Cys)
GS + HSA adsorb more efficiently than 2(C12Cys) GS alone.
The negative value of both ΔGmic° and ΔGads° indicates
that both processes are spontaneous in the medium. The intermolecular
or intramolecular hydrophobic interactions of 2(C12Cys)
GS and HSA are significantly favored, possibly owing to the protein
unfolding and complex formation of surfactant–protein, therefore
resulting in the adsorption at the interface before micelle formation
in solution.

2.2 Steady-State Fluorescence Measurements
Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy is a useful method to investigate
the microenvironment differences in the area of the fluorophore and
to examine the protein tertiary structure. Figure 2a reveals the HSA fluorescence spectra with
and without 2(C12Cys) GS concentration (0.1–1 μM),
which exhibits quenching fluorescence intensity of HSA. This behavior
may be attributed to HSA–2(C12Cys) GS complex formation
and burial residues of aromatic amino acids, namely, Trp (tryptophan),
Tyr (tyrosine), and Phe (phenylalanine) to a nonpolar environment.
The deviations in the fluorescence spectra acquired by protein excitation
at 295 nm have been ascribed to the existence of Trp residues while
the variations that result from protein excitation at 280 nm are connected
with Trp and Tyr residues.45 As the intensity
of fluorescence and λmax (emission maximum) changes,
protein conformation occurs. Such parameters become essential tools
in examining protein folding or unfolding methods.46−48 The quantum
yield of tryptophan residues was much higher than tyrosine, and in
proteins where both Tyr and Trp residues are present; Tyr is generally
quenched by Trp residues. The deviations that were shown at 280 and
295 nm were found to be similar and were not revealed.

Figure 2 Fluorescence quenching
results of the HSA/2(C12Cys)
GS system: (a) quenching profiles with varying concentrations of the
surfactant, (b) Stern–Volmer plot, and (c) modified Stern–Volmer
plot.

Fluorescence quenching mechanisms are explained
by the two ways;
static and dynamic. The static mechanism involves the arrangement
of ground state complex formation among the fluorophore and quencher,
whereas dynamic quenching proceeds through the excited state complex
formation. The improved fluorescence quenching mechanisms were obtained
from the analysis of quantitative results. The quenching process was
calculated via the Stern–Volmer equation.49 6  where F0 and F stand for the fluorescence intensities without and with
the quencher, and [Q] and KSV specify the quencher concentration and the Stern–Volmer
quenching constant, respectively.

The value of KSV (4.41 × 105 L mol–1) found from the slope of Figure 2b, gives substantial
quenching of the HSA emission spectra by 2(C12Cys) GS.
The value of KSV was then used to calculate
the Kq (quenching rate constant) from
the following eq 7 7  where, τ0 is the average
fluorophore life time and is 10–8 s for biomolecules.

From Table 2, it
is fairly evident that the quenching rate constant values were in
the order of 1013 L mol–1 s–1, whereas scatter collision quenching constants with biopolymers
were in the order of 1010 L mol–1 s–1. The greater magnitude of the quenching rate constant
value reveals that quenching occurs through a static mechanism rather
than the dynamic procedure and consists of the ground state complex
formation among 2(C12Cys) GS and HSA.50−52

2(C12Cys) + HSA	4.41	4.41	0.989	3.11	1.19	–25.63	
The modified
Stern–Volmer eq 8 was used to calculate
the Kb (binding constant) and n (binding sites number). Log Kb (antilog of the intercept) and n (slope) of Figure 2c were used to estimate
the Kb and the n, respectively. 8  where Kb represents
the apparent binding constant of 2(C12Cys) GS and n is the number of binding sites. The intercept and slope
shown in Figure 2c
were utilized to determine Kb and n, respectively. In Table 2 the n value exhibits only one binding
class for 2(C12Cys) GS. The binding Gibbs free energy upon
surfactant combination was determined by the equation53 9  

The negative value of Gibbs free energy
indicates that the combination
of 2(C12Cys) GS and HSA was spontaneous and thermodynamically
favored.

2.3 Synchronous Fluorescence Measurements
The fluctuation of the microenvironment near fluorophores (Tyr/Trp)
was also examined via the synchronous fluorescence measurement. As
compared to conventional fluorescence, the measurement of synchronous
fluorescence was appropriate owing to its specificity toward aromatic
residues. It also diminishes spectral overlaps via weakening spectral
bands and simplifies the spectra by using a suitable wavelength.54 Observance of the Δλ among the excitation
and emission wavelengths at 15 and 60 nm, respectively, and the deviations
of the microenvironment around tyrosine and tryptophan residues were
probed.55,56 The related synchronous fluorescence spectra
(Figure 3a,b) depicts
that addition of 2(C12Cys) GS creates quenching around
the fluorophores (Tyr or Trp), showing the interaction and binding
of 2(C12Cys) GS with HSA. This quenching in fluorescence
is due to an exposure of an aromatic residue to hydrophobic tail of
2(C12Cys) GS. The interactions are more successfully apparent
in Figure 3a than in Figure 3b; the cause was
due to the greater affinity of 2(C12Cys) GS molecules toward
tryptophan (Trp) than that of the tyrosine (Tyr) residue. This statement
is in coherence with the results found in steady-state fluorescence.

spectra of HSA in the presence of varying concentrations
of 2(C12Cys) GS at 298 K (a) Δλ = 15 nm (represents
contributions due to tyrosine), and (b) Δλ = 60 nm (represents
contributions due to tryptophan).

2.4 UV–Visible Absorption Spectra
UV–visible absorption spectroscopy is a valuable tool to examine
the complex formation of ligand–protein.57,58 The transitions from highest occupied molecular orbital to lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital include σ → σ*, π
→ π*, n → σ*, and n → π*, which
are allowed transitions. In proteins, the essential amino acids and
binding cofactors usually have conjugated π systems which can
absorb the light. The HSA absorption spectra without and with the
increasing concentrations of 2(C12Cys) GS are shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 UV–vis absorption
spectra of HSA (4 μM) in the absence
and presence of various concentrations of 2(C12Cys) GS.

The typical absorption maximum at 280 nm can be
ascribed to the
occurrence of chromophores in the protein. A hyperchromic effect is
detected in the absorption spectra of HSA with rising concentration
of 2(C12Cys) GS from Figure 4. However, there was no significant change in the absorption
maxima. Such variations in the intensity of absorption show that there
was no effect on the chromophore microenvironment as a result of complex
formation (i.e., static quenching) in the ground state among chromophores
of HSA and 2(C12Cys) GS.

2.5 Far-UV CD Analysis
The results of
far-UV circular dichroism (CD) experiments can provide the evidence
regarding the secondary configuration of proteins.59 The CD spectra for HSA without and with the 2(C12Cys) GS are given in Figure 5. The two-negative double humped peaks at 208 nm (arise due
to π → π* transition) and 222 nm (arise due to
n → π* transition) in the ultraviolet region can be seen
in CD spectra of HSA which is a distinguishing feature of the α-helical
content of protein. At small concentrations of 2(C12Cys)
GS (0.1 mm), there was small variation in the helicity, signifying
that the secondary construction of HSA was probably balanced via 2(C12Cys) GS. In accordance with the literature60 the secondary structure of HSA was stabilized using a cross-linking
purpose at small concentration of 2(C12Cys) GS. Because
2(C12Cys) GS has binary tails, it may form a link between
specific nonpolar and negatively charged residues situated on dissimilar
loops of HSA. The liberated micelles start to form after the saturation
binding of HSA with 2(C12Cys) GS at high concentration,
which indicates that HSA has a prolonged structure with exposed hydrophobic
residues. The significant decrease in α-helix content for HSA
in the presence of 2(C12Cys) GS clearly revealed the more
hydrophobic nature. On the basis of the above results, it has been
concluded that the binding of 2(C12Cys) GS with HSA leads
to its unfolding. The results also pronounced more unfolding of HSA
in the presence of 2(C12Cys) GS because of the fact that
the electrostatic and hydrophobic forces that control this phenomenon
are more significant in the case of 2(C12Cys) GS.

of HSA (4 μM) in the absence and presence
of various concentrations of 2(C12Cys) GS.

2.6 Molecular Docking
The molecular docking
studies are useful in exploring the details related to interaction
and the binding sites of a ligand on protein and binding energies
of small molecules with proteins.61 Therefore,
the results of HEX 8.0 calculations illustrated hydrophobic interactions
between drug site I and II of HSA and the 2(C12Cys) GS
(Figure 6). Figure 6a,b displays binding
sites of HSA and the binding patches of 2(C12Cys) GS fitted
into the hydrophobic pockets of HSA, respectively.62 Further Figure 6c shows the detailed hydrogen bonded interactions with the
HSA residues viz., Asn 429, Asn 458, Val 455, Val 424, Ser 454, Glu
425, Tyr 411, and Lys 205 which play a critical role for GS interaction
to HSA. The binding free energy of the 2(C12Cys) GS with
the HSA was found to be −9.23 kcal/mol. From the docking results,
it was found that the 2(C12Cys) GS binds to HSA via hydrophobic
interactions into the binding pockets of HSA.

HSA, (b) docked pose of the compound into
the binding sites of HSA, (compound is shown in colored spheres),
(c) zoomed-in view showing the interactions of the compound with the
residues of HSA (compound is shown in spheres).

3 Conclusions
The cmc value of the 2(C12Cys) GS was reduced in the
presence of HSA, which depicted that there were significant interaction
among the protein and the GS. The fluorescence results indicate that
2(C12Cys) GS binds with HSA. This result reflects that
2(C12Cys) GS is a better fit to alter the conformation
of proteins. Additionally, quenching in the fluorescence technique
ensures the static process. The negative ellipticity value has been
reduced upon the addition of the surfactant because of unfolding HSA,
which was confirmed by CD data. The shift in the UV spectral lines
signifies the change in the secondary construction of the protein.
Molecular docking reveals the accurate domain of residues into which
2(C12Cys) GS gets fixed and complements the spectroscopic
findings. Thus, we can conclude that 2(C12Cys) GS, interacts
surprisingly with HSA and is further enhanced by the ligand to modify
the HSA conformation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Cystine (98%), n-dodecyl bromide (98%), and HSA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
USA. Acetone (99%, Merck, India), methanol (99%, S D Fine-Chem Limited,
India), hexane (98%, Merck, India), thymolphthalein (Kemphasol 98%),
and NaOH (97% Merck, India) were used as received.

The 2(C12Cys) GS was prepared and purified by following the reported
literature method.38 The synthesis method
of the 2(C12Cys) GS (Scheme S1) and its characterizations
such as elemental analysis, 1H NMR (Figure S1), and FT-IR
(Figure S2) are given in Supporting Information.

All chemicals and buffer solution used were of pure analytical
grade. DDW (double distilled water) was used during the experiments.
Sodium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) was used to prepare the stock
solutions of 2(C12Cys) GS and HSA.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Surface Tension (γ) Measurements
The measurements of surface tension were carried out in the 2(C12Cys) GS in presence of HSA using a SD Hardson tensiometer
by a ring detachment method at 25 °C. The circulating water thermostat
was used to maintain the temperature. The Pt−Ir ring was rinsing
perfectly before use. Prior to the experiment, the surface tension
of DDW was calibrated in the range of 72.0 ± 0.3 mN/m. DDW was
also used to clean the glassware.

4.2.2 Steady-State Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence spectra were analyzed by a RF-5301 PC fluorescence
spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) equipped with a xenon flash lamp
using quartz cells (1.0 cm). Before the analysis, the tool parameters
were set as: excitation wavelength (295 nm), emission wavelength range
(300–400 nm), and slit width (5 nm) along with a path distance
of 1 cm. HSA concentration (4 μM) and increasing concentration
of 2(C12Cys) GS (0.1–1 μM) were used in the
experiment. The fluorescence experiment was performed at 25 °C.

4.2.3 UV–Visible Spectroscopy
UV–visible spectra were recorded on a UV-1800 Schimadzu UV
spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length at room
temperature. Absorption spectra of the HSA and 2(C12Cys)
GS complex were evaluated in the range of 240–320 nm.

4.2.4 CD Measurements
The spectra of
CD were observed on a spectropolarimeter (Jasco J-815 model) equipped
with a microcomputer. The apparatus was calibrated with (+)-10-camphorsulfonic
acid and the entire CD analysis was carried out at 25 °C with
a thermostatically controlled cell holder attached to a circulating
water bath (Neslab RTE-110) with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C.
Variation in the secondary configuration of the protein was recorded
in the far-UV region (200–250 nm) via a path length (1 mm)
cell. The signal from the reference sample containing the buffer and
the surfactant was subtracted from the CD signal for entire measurements.
The high-tension current for the spectra acquired was originated to
be less than 600 V. The spectra were composed with a scan rate of
20 nm/min and a reaction time of 1 s. Every spectrum was the average
of four scans. The results are indicated in conditions of mean residue
ellipticity (MRE) shown below10 10  where θobs = the ellipticity
in millidegrees, CP = the molar concentration
of the HSA, n = the number of amino acid residues
of protein, and l = the path length of the cell in
centimeters.

4.2.5 Molecular Docking Studies
The molecular
docking studies were carried out by using HEX 8.0 software63 which is a molecular graphics program for calculating
and exhibiting viable docking modes of proteins and nucleic acids.
The crystal arrangement of the HSA (PDB ID: 1H9Z) was taken from
the protein data bank (http://www.rcsb.org./pdb). Visualization of the docked pose was completed by using CHIMERA
(www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera), PyMol (http://pymol.sourceforge.net/), and the Discovery Studio molecular graphics program.
