After a large outbreak in Brazil,
novel drugs against Zika virus
became extremely necessary. Evaluation of virus-based pharmacological
strategies concerning essential host factors brought us to the idea
that targeting the Axl receptor by blocking its dimerization function
could be critical for virus entry. Starting from experimentally validated
compounds, such as RU-301, RU-302, warfarin, and R428, we identified
a novel compound 2′ (R428 derivative) to be the most potent
for this task amongst a number of alternative compounds and leads.
The improved affinity of compound 2′ was confirmed by molecular
docking as well as molecular dynamics simulation techniques using
implicit solvation models. The current study summarizes a new possibility
for inhibition of the Axl function as a potential target for future
antiviral therapies.

Introduction
Zika virus (ZIKV) belongs
to the family of flaviviruses, which
was first isolated in 1947 from rhesus monkeys in the Zika forest
of Uganda.1−4 The ZIKV epidemic has drawn global attention after a large outbreak
in Brazil in 2014, which spread to over 60 countries. Transmissions
to humans are usually mediated by mosquitoes. However, the virus can
also be transmitted through sexual contact5−8 as well as from mother to fetus.9−11 Clinical observations suggest that ZIKV, transmitted from an infected
woman to a fetus, mainly, targets human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs)
and impairs their development.4 There are
no established drugs or vaccines against ZIKV yet. However, there
are different approaches suggested regarding how to deal with ZIKV.
For example, Ekins12 and coworkers suggest
as a first screening step defining a cell or target-based ZIKV in
vitro assay for a high throughput compound screening and as a second
step to test these compounds. The third step is to investigate the
entire genome of ZIKV for already known drug targets that might show
some activity against ZIKV in vitro. As a fourth step Ekins et al.
suggest homology model development for ZIKV proteins similar to those
that are used against dengue virus (DENV) treatment.12 Later on, they proposed to understand the exact mechanism
of action to screen the compounds with higher target specificity and,
finally, to test them on animals.12

Another strategy to cease ZIKV replication was proposed by Mumtaz
and co-workers.13 In particular, antiviral
drugs such as 7-deaza-2′-C-methyladenosine (7DMA), 2′-C-methylcytidine,
ribavirin, favipiravir, and T-1105 were suggested as a potent NS5
polymerase inhibitors.13 Although ribavirin
and favipiravir have other indications, they were also tested against
ZIKV, providing less antiviral effect in vitro than 7DMA. In silico
drug screening against ZIKV NS2B-NS3 protease inhibitors has been
performed by Yuan et al.,14 which, ultimately,
yielded two potent drugs—novobiocin and lopinavir/ritonavir.
The potency of novobiocin has been confirmed by molecular dynamics
(MD) simulation, as it was forming a stable complex with a protease,14 as well as by in vivo studies, where it showed
a high survival rate in novobiocin-treated mice compared to untreated
ones.14 Other medications, such as emricasan
and niclosamide, were tested by Xu et al.,4 which also aimed to inhibit ZIKV replication. We follow here a new
promising and independent strategy to prevent ZIKV infection from
the start, blocking the entry via the host receptor.

As mentioned
above, ZIKV causes abnormalities in the developing
fetal nervous system.15 However, the exact
mechanism by which the virus enters and affects neural cells is poorly
investigated. Nowakowski15,16 in his work reported
that ZIKV entry into neural stem cells is mediated by the Axl receptor,
one of the members of TAM family receptors.17 The Axl receptor was found to be highly expressed in radial glia
cells,16,17 neural stem cells,18 as well as endothelial cells,18 and hence,
it was hypothesized to be susceptible for the ZIKV entry. It is worth
to note that Axl itself does not play a role of the entry factor for
the virus. The virus entry into the host cells occurs only when the
Axl receptor is dimerized with its ligand—the Gas6 protein.19,20 The dimerization mechanism serves as a bridge for binding to the
phosphatidylserine molecules surrounding the viral capsid. The whole
process triggers the fusion of the virus inside the host cell.19,20

Following this path, we propose blocking the Axl dimerization
with
its ligand (Gas6) to prevent the virus entry into the human neural
cells. This can be achieved via competitive binding of drug-like molecules
to the Axl–Gas6 dimerization site. In this study, we compared
already existing compounds such as warfarin,21 R428,22 RU-301,23 and RU-30223 to in silico designed novel
drug-like molecules to find lead candidates with higher affinity to
the Axl receptor dimerization site using molecular docking and MD
approaches with implicit solvation models.

Results and Discussion
The role of the Axl receptor for ZIKV entry is still under investigation.
Several labs reported that the Axl receptor may not play an important
role in ZIKV infection.24−27 Therefore, for instance, Wang et al.24 claim that the Axl-deficient mice show the same level of
replication of ZIKV as nondeficient ones. The findings of Wang were
previously supported by the work of Li et al.,25 in which they demonstrated in an Axl-knockout mouse model
that the Axl receptor was not the key entry receptor for the ZIKV
infection. Similar results were obtained by Hastings et al.,26 indicating that TAM receptors (Axl, Tyro3 and
Mertk) are not necessary for ZIKV entry in mice. They show this by
blocking the type I interferon receptor with a MAR1-5A3 antibody,
which did not have any impact on reducing the ZIKV infection in mice.26 Wells et al.27 reported
that the Axl deletion had no effect on ZIKV entry in nondifferentiated
hNPCs. In contrast, several in vitro studies in various differentiated
human cell types show that blocking of the Axl receptor stops ZIKV
infection.18,28−31

Taking into consideration
all these results above, we conclude
that the different observations relate to differences in the composition
of entry receptors in the mouse and human. For this reason, it is
well-possible that ZIKV entry is not Axl-sensitive in mice and, according
to one report, may even be in human nondifferentiated neuronal progenitor
cells, while in humans, the observations point to the Axl receptor
as an important entry route for ZIKV, at least, for all differentiated
human cell types tested.

Another caveat is that cells in vitro
are not able to express the
whole spectra of the entry receptors that they usually express in
vivo, and different types of tissue can also differ in the composition
of entry receptors.

Following our hypothesis, we used in silico
methods to design new
drug-like molecules for inhibition of the Axl receptor dimerization
and, hence, prevent ZIKV infection in human cells. Besides the Axl
protein as a drug target, there are other viral proteins and host
factors as potential candidates for inhibition (Table 1). For instance, vaccine strategies can target
surface epitopes,32−34 as these methods have been previously applied for
flavivirus glycoproteins (glycoprotein E, for example). On the other
hand, most viruses can acquire rapid drug resistance against viral
polymerase or protease inhibitors.35,36 This can be
also confirmed by multiple alignments of DEAD-like helicases, glycoprotein
E, and RNA-directed RNA polymerase performed for the ZIKV, West Nile
(WNV), dengue (DENV), and yellow fever (YFV) viruses. As the alignments
show, there are many conserved regions for RNA-directed RNA polymerase
shared among all considered strains of these flaviviruses. However,
less conserved regions can be observed for the DEAD-like helicases
and several for the E protein C terminal domains, which indicates
that the virus can undergo mutations easily. The conserved domains
in the above-mentioned alignments are labeled as an asterisk sign
(please refer to the separately attached .clw files for the DEAD-like
helicases superfamily, E protein C terminal domain, and RNA-directed
RNA polymerase in the Supporting Information). The references describing each sequence in the alignment are given
in the Supporting Information.

In this study,
we, therefore, concentrated on the Axl receptor,
a host protein required for virus entry, as a promising drug target
to treat the ZIKV infection. Using the molecular docking method, we
tested RU-301 and RU-302, the compounds designed by Kimani et al.23 specifically for targeting the Axl–Gas6
dimerization site to suppress cancer disease by Gas6-induced Axl signaling,
as well as warfarin and R428—known Axl blockers.21,22 Warfarin is an indirect Axl blocker, an anticoagulant drug known
for binding and inhibition of vitamin K epoxide reductase - an enzyme
responsible for carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in the binding
proteins, which are important for blood coagulation.37 In this case, inhibition of epoxide reductase by warfarin
would prevent carboxylation of glutamic acid residues in the epidermal
growth factor domain of Gas6 protein (ligand for the Axl receptor),
responsible for attachment to the membrane of the viral envelope and
facilitating fusion of the virus into the host cell.19 R428 is an anticancer drug that is intended to target the
kinase domain of the Axl receptor.22,38 However, most
of the anticancer kinase inhibitors are known to be promiscuous, that
is, they also target other kinases and/or have additional binding
modes.38 Therefore, the choice of the considered
compounds is based also on this logic.

To evaluate the binding
capabilities of these and our new derivatives,
we, first, tested the abovementioned designed compounds RU-301 and
RU-302 suggested by Kimani et al.23 In Figure 1 are shown these
compounds at the Axl-Gas6 dimerization site. Both compounds fit the
pocket in a similar binding mode. In particular, they are accommodated,
mainly, occupying the space between E 56 and E 59 residues and exposing
the pyrrolidine ring toward H 61. Slightly better binding is noticed
for RU-301 compared to RU-302 (please refer to Table 2), which is in agreement with experimental
data. According to the results obtained by Kimani and coworkers,23 both RU-301 and RU-302 show potent Axl–Gas6
inhibitory activity at 10 μM in oncogenic cells. RU-301 has
shown slightly higher inhibitory activity than RU-302. In particular,
the average percentage of Gas6 inhibition in H1299, U2-OS, and Calu-1
cells for RU-301 is 59, 52, and 44%, respectively, while the same
activity for RU-302 is 45, 50, and 43%, respectively.23 These data are in a good accordance with our docking results,
showing that RU-301 binds to the dimerization site with slightly higher
affinity (lower binding energy) than RU-302 (see Table 2 for clarity).

Next, to improve
the Axl inhibition possibilities, we modified
warfarin and R428, the pharmaceutically available drugs, using them
as chemical “scaffolds” according to the scheme described
in Figure 2. The summarized
docking results for these novel analogues are shown in Table 2, where compound 2′ (ΔG = −13.06 kcal/mol) is detected as a lead molecule
with the strongest affinity to Axl.

Figure 2 2D structures of warfarin and R428 (left)
as chemical “scaffolds”.
In silico design of novel analogues by structure modifications (right).
Compound 1 has been obtained by adding the C–C=O–C
group to warfarin that is indicated by X. Compound 2 was generated
by the addition of one more benzene ring at the position indicated
by Y. Compounds 3–5 were generated by adding methionine, phenylalanine,
and tryptophan to compound 1. Compound 1′ was constructed by
adding arginine to R428 at position indicated by X′ and compound
2′ was produced via the modification of compound 1′
through pyrrolidine ring extension at position indicated by Y′.

Figure 3 shows the
conformational changes of warfarin and its analogues in the Axl dimerization
site, indicating their structural misfit to the binding cavity due
to poor binding properties: a conformational shift inside the binding
pocket toward E 56 and E 59 residues was observed for the warfarin,
compounds 1 and 2 (Figure 3B,C). This change involves warfarin modification through the
C–C=O–C extension (compound 1) and cyclohexane
addition (compound 2). Eventually, these modifications contributed
to the slight improvement of warfarin-based compounds via additional
interactions of the C–C=O–C moiety with the Q
78 amino group of Axl (Figures 3B, C, S1 and S2 of the Supporting Information). On the other hand, compounds 3–5 are found to be more potent
inhibitors of Axl in terms of binding energies (see Table 2) compared to compounds 1 and
2 and the parental drug itself. They are more symmetrically oriented
with respect to the key amino acid residues (Figures 3D–F and S3–S5 of the Supporting Information), and this is, mainly,
due to the interactions they make with these residues. So, the amino
group of compound 3 interacts with the carboxyl group of E 56, while
the carbonyl group of the compound interacts with the amino group
of Q 78 (Figure S3). Similarly, the amino
group of the phenylalanine, which belongs to compound 4, interacts
with the carboxyl group of E 56 and the oxygen atom of the compound’s
aromatic ring interacts with one of the hydrogen atoms of the Q 78
amino group (Figures 3E and S4 of the Supporting Information). In the case of compound 5, there is a contact between the amino
group of the ligand and the carboxyl group of E 56 (Figures 3F and S5 of the Supporting Information). There are two contacts
observed with Q 78: one is between the oxygen atom of Q 78 and the
hydrogen atom from the NH group of tryptophan that belongs to compound
5; the other one is between the hydrogen atom of the amino group of
Q 78 and the oxygen atom of the aromatic ring of the compound. The
amino group of Q 76 interacts with the carbonyl group of compound
5 (Figures 3F and S5
of the Supporting Information).

while the residues that make additional contacts are shown in cornflower
blue. The compounds as well as the residues are shown in ball and
stick representation.

R428-based analogues provided even higher binding affinity
to the
Axl in comparison to warfarin-based ones. The R428 drug was slightly
shifted toward the E 56 and E 59 residues (Figures 4A and S6 of the Supporting Information). In particular, the amino group of R428 was likely
to create two additional contacts: one with the carboxyl group of
E 56 and the other with the carboxyl group of E 85 (Figures 4A and S6 of the Supporting Information). Any additional R428
modifications were introduced to enhance the structural fit to the
Axl pocket. The results of docking for the compound 1′ have
shown a higher affinity of binding compared to the original drug.
Besides the interactions with the carboxyl groups of E 56 and E 59
inside the pocket, an additional interaction with the amino group
of arginine, which is the part of the newly designed drug, with the
carboxyl group of E 85 and Q 78 of the receptor resulted in better
fit and stronger binding than that of the R428 (Figures 4B and S7 of Supporting Information). Compound 2′ has shown the best binding
affinity to the Axl receptor, probably, because of more symmetrical
occupancy of the receptor’s binding pocket (Figure 4C). The polycyclic modification
of compound 2′ allowed it to be accommodated in a pocket with
higher structural congruency, establishing a hydrophobic contact with
E 85. The arginine part of the compound interacts with a carboxyl
group of E 59. Furthermore, the CO group of Q78 makes contacts with
the amino group of arginine (Figure S7 of the Supporting Information), which, in turn, strengthens the binding
of compound 2′, expanding the possibilities to use the R428
derivatives as the Axl receptor inhibitors not only for ZIKV treatment,
but also in cancer therapy.

Validation Considerations and Data
First of all, we
started with known and validated Axl inhibitors: RU-301 and RU-302
were tested and validated in vitro to block the Axl receptor dimerization
site.23 To identify new compounds for Axl
receptor inhibition, we looked at warfarin and R428, which are the
Axl receptor inhibitors sufficiently validated in their action to
be used in clinical trials.21,22,39 In Table 3, the experimentally
available IC (IC50) values are reported. As can be noticed,
the calculated value of Kd and the experimentally
obtained inhibitory concentrations are in the similar range, which
shows the congruency of the simulation results with experimental data.
The calculated Kd value for the designed
compound 2′ has shown the lowest value. This means that compound
2′ would have quite a low inhibitory concentration and, hence,
a very strong inhibitory activity.

To further validate our results, the binding free energies (ΔGbind) based on the implicit solvation models
were estimated for the best binding compound (2′) to the Axl
receptor and warfarin as a reference molecule. The MM-GB/PBSA calculations
using the 50 ns MD trajectories confirmed the molecular docking results:
compound 2′ has much higher affinity to the Axl receptor in
comparison to the reference molecule (see Table 4).

To investigate
the structural movement of the studied systems,
the root mean square deviation (rmsd) of the warfarin and compound
2′, bound to the Axl receptor, with respect to the initial
conformation was plotted versus simulation time (see Figure S9 in
the Supporting Information). The complexes
stay well-stable, supporting good binding. Moreover, the root mean
square fluctuation (rmsf) parameter of Axl presented almost identical
atomic movements either in the complex with warfarin or compound 2′
(Figure S9 C and D of the Supporting Information), followed by the absence of significant secondary structure changes
(Figure S10A,B in the Supporting Information). In our study, we analyzed the protein–ligand interactions
but not the protein folding or stability using 50 ns MD simulation.
The 50 ns time scale is entirely sufficient for this investigation
as an optimum time (usually 50–100 ns) and has already been
confirmed by numerous publications.40−42

Finally, with
later application and preclinical or clinical tests
in mind, the toxicity potential of compound 2′ was assessed
using trained Bayesian models and a sub-structure similarity search
algorithm. This predicted only minor cytotoxic effects of the novel
lead in various in vitro assays compared to the reference molecule
(warfarin) (see Figure 5A and B).

using trained Bayesian models and sub-structure similarity search
algorithm. Color-coded diagrams represent the signatures with low
(blue), intermediate (white), or high toxic activity (red). The abbreviations
of these three different biological assay systems are reported in Table 5.

Conclusions
Our hypothesis is that targeting a host
factor—the Axl receptor—could
stop not only ZIKV infection, but also the spread of other flaviviruses,
as it uses this receptor as a medium to enter into the host cell.
Among the other suggested drugs, warfarin and R428, the known Axl
inhibitors, have not been considered yet as promising candidates to
tackle ZIKV. We propose here novel in silico designed compounds—warfarin-
and R428-based derivatives—to prevent ZIKV internalization
into the neural cells. Molecular docking simulations, performed for
the RU-301, RU-302, warfarin, R428, and the new derivatives, have
shown improved binding properties for the designed analogues compared
to the original drugs in favor of R428-based ones. In particular,
the new derivatives of R428, compound 1′ and compound 2′,
demonstrated the best binding capabilities to the Axl receptor amongst
all the studied compounds. The results of docking have been confirmed
by MD simulation analysis, showing the highest affinity for compound
2′ to the binding pocket. Additionally, the toxicity test has
predicted reduced toxicity for it. Therefore, after carefully looking
at a range of alternative strategies, we would suggest compound 2′
as a lead based on our computational analysis. Lead synthesis and
further preclinical tests are recommended regarding cytotoxicity and
teratogenicity for future biomedical applications including blocking
of the ZIKV infection as well as prevention of severe complications
of flaviviridae in general.

Methods
Sequence Analysis
Iterative sequence similarity searches,
domain analysis, and sequence alignment followed the standard protocols
as previously described.43,44

Structure Derivation
The 3D coordinates for the Axl–Gas6
complex have been retrieved from the protein data bank (PDB) under
the reference code 2C5D.45 In the current
docking study, an Axl receptor has been considered. The 3D structures
of the drugs warfarin and R428 were derived from the PubChem database
under the references CID 54678486 and CID 46215462, respectively.

The 3D structures of the drugs RU-301 and RU-302 have been constructed
according to the 2D scheme provided by Kimani et al.23

Design of the Compounds
The residue
composition and
the shape of the binding pocket were carefully analyzed. The design
of new compounds was mainly based on their affinity. We tried several
possibilities of building small molecules and filling up the binding
pocket by using warfarin and R428 as starting templates. After evaluation
of binding energies, we finally identified five high-affinity derivatives
for warfarin and two derivatives for R428. To obtain analogues, the
structures of the drugs have been modified with the help of the Avogadro
software46 (version 1.1.1, available at https://avogadro.cc/). Compound
1 has been designed by adding the C–C=O–C group
to the warfarin structure at the position indicated by X (please,
refer to the left side of Figure 2 for clarity). Compound 2 has been designed by adding
the cyclohexane group; the position is indicated by Y (see Figure 2, left side). Compounds
3–5, in turn, were designed by the addition of methionine,
phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively, to the structure of the
already existing compound 1 (see Figure 2). Compound 1′ has been designed by
structural modification of the existing drug R428. In particular,
the structure was derived by adding arginine at position X′.
The compound 1′ has been further modified by extending pyrrolidine
rings three more times at position, indicated by Y′; hence,
compound 2′ has been obtained (refer to Figure 2 for clarity). All the compounds prior to
docking were energy-minimized using the steepest descent algorithm
to relax the structures.

Molecular Docking
Molecular docking
has been performed
using the AutoDock software47 (version
4.2.6, available at http://autodock.scripps.edu). There is a lot of alternative docking software around, for instance,
BINDSURF,48 METADOCK,49 LeadFinder,50 the BLIND DOCKING
server (available at http://bio-hpc.ucam.edu/achilles/), FlexScreen,51,52 and Vina.53,54 All of these have specific advantages
and limitations and aficionados. However, we opted for AutoDock, as
experienced AutoDock users and also because it is free of charge.
In addition, it has the Lamarckian genetic algorithm implemented in
a software that describes well the conformation of the ligand inside
the pocket. Moreover, it is one of the most reliable and most widely
used protein–ligand docking software.55,56

The AutoDock tools were used to generate input parameter files
for docking. For the current study, the receptor was considered as
a rigid molecule, while ligands contained rotatable bonds. Only protein
molecules were used for the docking, while all nonprotein moieties
were discarded. Additional hydrogen atoms were added to the receptor,
and the new PDB coordinates were saved. The ligand PDB file was modified
by the addition of group of charges, the so-called Gasteiger charges.
The volume of the grid box was set as 60 × 60 × 60 with
a 0.375 Å spacing (default value). The default values for the
grid volume and spacing were used as in the AutoGrid calculation procedure,
the protein is placed in a three-dimensional grid, and at each grid
point a probe atom is placed. The energy of the interaction of this
single atom with the protein is assigned to the grid point. Typically,
grid point spacing is in the range of 0.2 to 1.0 Å, and the default
value, 0.375 Å, signifies roughly a quarter of the length of
the carbon–carbon single bond.

The center of the grid
box was centered so that it included the
important amino acids responsible for the ligand dimerization (E 56,
E 59, T 75, T 77, and V 79).45 A genetic
algorithm was selected to set the search parameters. The number of
docking runs was fixed to 50. The conformations with the lowest binding
energies have been selected for further analysis.

Molecular Dynamics
All MD simulations were performed
using the AMBER 16 package.57 These simulations
were performed by the AMBER 12 package using the FF99SB and general
Amber force field force-fields for the Axl receptor and ligand molecules.
The systems were solvated with the TIP3P water models and neutralized
with Na+ ions using the tLEaP input script available from
the AmberTools. Long-range electrostatic interactions were applied
via the particle-mesh Ewald method.58 The
SHAKE algorithm59 was used to constrain
the length of covalent bonds, including hydrogen atoms. The Langevin
thermostat was implemented to equilibrate the temperature of the systems
at 300 K. A 2.0 fs time step was used for all simulations. 10 000
steps and 1 ns time period were used for minimization and equilibration
with reference to all studied systems. Finally, 50 ns classical MD
simulations with no constraints were performed for each of the receptor–ligand
complexes using the molecular mechanics energies combined with the
Poisson–Boltzmann (MM-PBSA) or generalized Born (MM-GBSA) and
surface area continuum solvation approaches.42,60,61

According to the AMBER MM-PBSA/GBSA
protocol (Miller et al., 2012; http://ambermd.org/tutorials/advanced/tutorial3/),62 we used the explicit solvation model
for all MD simulations and later the implicit solvation (MM-PBSA/GBSA)
as a postprocessing end-state method to calculate free energies of
molecules in solution by means of the python script (MM-PBSA.py).

Toxicity Predictions
The PolyPharma software was used
to predict the ligand potential toxic effects using trained Bayesian
models and sub-structure similarity search algorithm based on the
experimental data from various in vitro assays (Table 5). The software implements the effective Bayesian variants,
which involved a Laplacian correlation to avoid any scale mismatches and floating point precision
issues.63
