Most array-based sensing platforms,
to date, utilize static response
patterns for discrimination of a wide variety of analytes, but only
a few studies have focused on the important task of quantitatively
resolving structural isomers, which are nowadays important because
of their broad usage in medicines and industries. A possible way of
accomplishing this feat is to combine kinetic (rather
than static) sensor response profiles with the chemical tongue strategy
to allow the development of array-based sensors for isomeric discrimination.
Here, by adding the time dimension, a simple and novel gold nanorod
(AuNR)-based chrono-colorimetric sensor array is proposed for chemical
discrimination applications. Because of their similar structure but
different redox potentials, dihydroxybenzene (DHB) structural isomers
have been chosen, as models, to evaluate the applicability of the
proposed array. The principle of the array relies on various growth
rates of silver shells on AuNRs at different silver ion/AuNR concentration
ratios owing to the different kinetic behaviors of DHBs, which can
be used as fingerprints to identify DHBs with the help of multivariate
analysis methods. The combinatorial colorimetric response of AuNRs
upon DHB addition has been analyzed by linear discriminant analysis
and hierarchical cluster analysis. Finally, identification of individual
DHBs or their mixtures in real samples confirms the potential application
of the proposed array.

Introduction
Catechol (2DHB), resorcinol
(3DHB), and hydroquinone (4DHB) are
the three isomers of dihydroxybenzene (DHB), which are widely used
in cosmetic, pharmaceutical, plastic, rubber, tanning, paint, and
dye industries. They are also present in effluents from oil refineries,
coal tar, steel, and pulp mill plants.1−3 Because of their low
degradability and high toxicity, they have been certified as the second
kind of toxic environmental pollutant by the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) and the European Union (EU).4 Furthermore, catechol has many important biological significances
such as antioxidation and regulation of some enzymatic activities,
occurring naturally in many plants such as fruits, teas, vegetables,
and traditional Chinese medicines.5 DHB
isomers usually coexist and interfere with each other owing to their
similar structures and physiochemical properties.6 Therefore, development of reliable, simple, sensitive,
rapid, and efficient methods for discrimination and determination
of DHB isomers is of great importance to environmental and food safety
as well as public health concerns.

Several electrochemical,7−9 chromatographic,10,11 chemiluminescence,12,13 capillary electrophoresis,14 phosphorescence,15 fluorescence,16 and
spectrophotometric17 methods have been
developed thus far for the
determination of DHB isomers. Despite the high sensitivity and low
cost of the widely explored electrochemical methods, electrode modification
is always required because of the electrochemical inactivity of resorcinol
and the broad overlapped peaks of catechol and hydroquinone.18,19 On the other hand, chromatographic methods are time-consuming and
costly and rely on sample preparation and complicated instrumentation
in spite of their minimal cross-interference. Hence, it is necessary
to develop rapid, sensitive, and cost-effective systems for simultaneous
detection and discrimination of DHB isomers.

Moving from specific
individual lock-and-key sensors toward cross-reactive
colorimetric sensor arrays enables the recognition and discrimination
of groups of target species such as explosives,20−22 toxic gases,23−25 beverages and foods,26,27 biomolecules,28−30 pathogenic
bacteria and fungi,31−33 and nanoparticles.34,35 This approach
employs semiselective sensing elements to generate composite response
patterns which are unique fingerprints of each analyte.36 However, static time responses have been employed
in colorimetric sensor arrays so far, which limits their application
in discrimination of structural isomers. Considering the limitations
involved in the simultaneous determination of DHB isomers owing to
their similar structures, array-based approaches based on the kinetic
electrochemical behavior of targets are the potential candidate for
this purpose.

In many other fields, plasmonic gold and silver
nanostructures
have recently gained immense interest as novel and efficient sensor
elements.37−40 This is fueled by fascinating unique photophysical properties of
plasmonic nanomaterials which are not accessible with conventional
chemically responsive sensing elements. In particular, gold nanorods
(AuNRs) are promising plasmonic nanostructures as the next generation
of sensing elements in the design of colorimetric arrays. This arises
from their intensive longitudinal surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
within the visible or near-IR regions, which is sensitive to their
aspect ratio (AR) and the local dielectric constant of the surrounding
environment.41−45 Overgrowth of silver nanoshells on the surface of AuNRs leads to
a sharp-contrast multicolor change, which has been utilized thus far
for colorimetric detection of ascorbic acid (AA),46 biogenic amines,47 perishable
products,48 viruses,49 immunoassay,50 and enzyme activity.51 However, the fascinating phenomenon of silver
metallization of AuNRs, to date, has not been employed in many array
sensors. Accordingly, there are great strides in terms of utilizing
AuNRs as simple sensing elements in the fabrication of colorimetric
sensor arrays.

In this study, contrary to previous reports,
by integrating time
to colorimetric sensor arrays, we have developed a promising chrono-colorimetric
sensor array (CSA) based on the growth of silver shells on AuNRs at
different silver ion/AuNR concentration ratios at different time intervals,
which is capable of identifying DHB structural isomers. Catechol and
hydroquinone can reduce silver ions (Ag+) to silver atoms
(Ag0) with different kinetics at neutral pHs, leading to
anisotropic silver nanoshell deposition on the surface of AuNRs. The
changes in the surface composition and AR of AuNRs cause a blue shift
of the LSPR peak, resulting in a rainbowlike multicolor change from
red to orange to yellow to green, providing a colorimetric method
for the discrimination of 2DHB and 4DHB. The kinetic behavior of target
analytes depends on the silver ion/AuNR concentration ratios. Moreover,
in situ formation of spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the
presence of catechol, resorcinol, and hydroquinone at basic conditions
with different growth kinetics and distribution sizes was employed
to enhance the discrimination ability of the proposed array. Discerning
response patterns, at time intervals of 5 min, can be used as fingerprints
to accurately differentiate the DHB isomers by standard statistical
methods, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and linear discriminant
analysis (LDA). It was found that the discrimination ability to DHBs
was significantly enhanced by the addition of the time dimension to
the proposed colorimetric array. Ultimately, the potential application
of the proposed chrono-CSA for the determination of catechol, resorcinol,
and hydroquinone in skin bleaching cream and tap water was studied.

Results
and Discussion
Principle and Fabrication of the Array
As schematically
illustrated in Scheme 1, the array sensing strategy mainly relies on the anisotropic growth
of ultrathin silver shells on AuNRs in the presence of catechol and
hydroquinone. Figure 1 shows the extinction spectra and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of the AuNRs before and after silver overgrowth on AuNRs
induced by 40 μM catechol. The as-prepared AuNRs with a high
AR of 6.5 ± 0.2 exhibit an LSPR peak at 970 nm. Target analyte-induced
reduction of silver ions (Ag+) to silver atoms (Ag0) results in transverse Ag deposition on AuNRs and thus a
decrease of the AR of the Au@Ag core–shell nanorods. The changes
of the surface composition and AR of AuNRs cause a blue shift of the
LSPR peak, resulting in a multicolor change of the nanorod solution
by increasing the time. In spite of the quite similar structures of
DHBs (Figure 2), the
considerable oxidation potential difference (100 mV) between 2DHB
and 4DHB on the gold surface causes them to have different kinetic
behaviors in inducing Ag overgrowth on AuNRs.54 This further leads to a distinct blue-shift profile of the LSPR
peak in time for 2DHB and 4DHB. Furthermore, the blue-shift extent
of the LSPR peak highly depends on the number of silver ions reduced
by DHBs in the presence of AuNRs. Higher concentration ratios of silver
ions to AuNRs are expected to accelerate the silver deposition rate.55,56 In the absence of the target analytes, insignificant spectral changes
of AuNRs were observed by the addition of AgNO3 at time
intervals of 5 min (Figure S1A–D). In addition, the AuNRs remain unchanged in the presence of resorcinol
(3DHB) because the oxidation potential of resorcinol (3DHB) is far
away from those of both 2DHB and 4DHB; hence, 3DHB is incapable of
reducing silver ions on AuNRs at neutral pHs. Therefore, the DHB-induced
formation of AgNPs in the basic medium was employed to improve the
discrimination ability of the proposed array. Phenolic groups of DHBs
are ionized under basic conditions and converted to phenolate anions
which are more reducible, which can facilitate the formation of AgNPs.57 However, silver ions can participate in a reaction
known as mirror reaction by the addition of NaOH. Consequently, sodium
citrate (5 × 10–3 M) together with NaOH was
used as the fifth sensor element. In the presence of citrate, silver
ions can exist in the complex form, which thus prevents the precipitation
of silver.58 There is no evidence of AgNP
formation by the addition of sodium citrate to the silver solution
in a basic medium in the absence of DHBs (Figure S1E). Finally, an array of five sensor elements was designed
for the discrimination of DHBs.

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Detection Principle
of the Proposed Array
Array Responses to DHBs
Catechol, hydroquinone, and
resorcinol with different concentrations (1–800 μM) were
added to the five sensor elements, and the UV–vis spectra were
recorded at 1, 5, and 10 min (Figure S2). A representative figure of the array response against 80 μM
different DHBs at different time intervals indicates that the spectral
change profiles of the array are the fingerprints for each DHB, as
shown in Figure 3.
In the presence of 2DHB and 4DHB, the AuNRs experience a larger blue
shift of their LSPR peak (Δλ) with a progressive increase
in the silver ion/AuNR concentration ratio at a particular time, whereas
no spectral changes occurred in the presence of 3DHB. The LSPR peak
shifts to a shorter wavelength with higher intensities in the presence
of 2DHB, indicating the formation of a thicker layer of silver nanoshells
and hence smaller ARs of AuNRs in comparison with 4DHB. Furthermore,
2DHB and 4DHB show different kinetic behaviors at a particular silver
ion/AuNR concentration ratio, which results in various blue shifts
of the AuNR LSPR peak at various times. It can be suggested that the
distinct chronochromic behaviors, which were observed during silver
deposition on the surface of AuNRs at different silver ion/AuNR concentration
ratios, originate from different oxidation potentials and kinetic
behaviors of the selected DHB isomers on the Au surface. Moreover,
distinctive kinetic behaviors of the AgNP formation and also different
properties of the AgNPs in terms of plasmon resonance peak, size distribution,
and concentration were observed with the selected DHBs (Figure 3M,N). As demonstrated in Figure 3O, the color change
profiles of the array against 80 μM selected DHBs provide a
robust fingerprint for each DHB and can be observed directly by the
naked eye. As shown in Figure 3, the spectral responses are different for a given sensor
element in the presence of different DHBs at different times and shows
different kinetic behaviors of the same DHB with different sensing
elements, confirming the cross-reactive property of this chrono-CSA.

of 80 μM). (O) Color change patterns of five sensor elements
at different times against different DHBs.

Discrimination of DHB Isomers
Standard pattern recognition
methods were employed to expose the potential of the chronochromic
sensor array more explicitly. As shown in Table S1, the absorbance intensity at several wavelengths, Δλ,
and Δarea of the response spectra at 1, 5, and 10 min corresponding
to each sensing element was chosen for quantitative comparison of
the spectral changes of the array. Accordingly, the data matrix (90-dimensional
vectors) based on ΔA (i.e., difference between
the absorbance after adding analytes and the absorbance of the LSPR
peak of AuNRs, as blank), Δλ (i.e., wavelength shift of
the LSPR peak of AuNRs after adding analytes), and Δarea (i.e.,
difference between UV–vis spectrum integral of AuNRs before
and after adding analytes) values was generated. HCA, which is a model-free
method based on the clustering of the analyte vectors according to
their Euclidean distances in their full vector space,59 was performed to analyze the data from the proposed array
for different DHBs at concentrations ranging from 10 to 250 μM.
As shown in Figure 4, the HCA dendrogram demonstrates that all of the three DHBs are
correctly assigned to their respective groups, and different concentrations
of each DHB are clustered together accurately without any misclassification
(in triplicate trials). The collected response profiles of the array
at a concentration range of 10–250 μM for the three DHBs
against five sensing elements at 1, 5, and 10 min are shown in Figure S3. The fingerprint barplot response patterns
for each DHB isomer (80 μM) demonstrate that the response profiles
are different for a given sensing element at a particular time in
the presence of different DHBs and distinct profiles for a given analyte
exposed to different sensing elements at different times, confirming
the feasibility of the array for the discrimination of the selected
DHBs (Figure 5). To
further evaluate the performance of the proposed array to discriminate
DHBs, LDA was utilized to quantitatively discriminate DHBs, according
to their linear combination of features. Chronochromic response patterns
of DHBs against sensing elements at different times were subjected
to LDA. As shown in Figure 6, a well-clustered two-dimensional plot with a classification
accuracy of 100% was obtained as a result of reduction and transformation
of the training matrix (5 sensing elements × 3 various times
× 3 DHBs × 7 concentrations × 3 replicates) to canonical
scores. Variations (61.6% and 34.5%) in the data for DHBs were obtained,
and the DHBs were successfully clustered into three distinct groups
and basically have no overlap in the canonical score plot, revealing
that the chrono-CSA is capable of discriminating DHBs at wide concentration
ranges.

for DHB isomers was observed. All of the experiments were performed
in triplicate. The concentration range of DHBs was 10–800 μM;
the concentrations of polyphenols were 5 and 800 μM.

and a control illustrating the ability of the array to discriminate
DHB isomers. All of the experiments were performed in triplicate.
The concentration range of DHB isomers was 10–800 μM;
the concentrations of other polyphenols were 5 and 800 μM.

Selectivity of the Array
In real indoor sample analysis,
DHBs often coexist with other phenolic compounds, such as gallic acid
(THBA) and pyrogallol (THB). Accordingly, the selectivity of the proposed
array was assessed by changing the above possible interfering species.
THBA and THB are known as reducing agents in the synthesis of silver
and gold nanoparticles.60,61 Therefore, the response
of the sensor in the presence of THBA and THB was recorded to evaluate
their capability of reducing silver ions on the AuNR surface. As shown
in Figure S4, the array response spectra
at 1 and 800 μM polyphenol compounds are totally different from
those of the DHBs. Furthermore, they are clustered in separate groups
in the HCA dendrogram (Figure 4) and LDA score plot (Figure 6). It seems that different redox potentials of these
polyphenols play a key role in their distinct kinetic behaviors; thereby,
they do not consider the interference in the proposed colorimetric
array.

Color Difference Maps
Color difference maps, as a useful
qualitative approach for visualization of the colorimetric sensor
array responses, were obtained by subtraction of the absorbance before
and after DHB exposure at three visible wavelengths (i.e., 700, 800,
and 900 nm for SE1–SE4 and 350, 450, and 550 for SE5). Difference
patterns presented in Figure 7 demonstrate the color change patterns as fingerprints for
each DHB at a wide concentration range from 10 to 800 μM. Collected
in triplicate trials, the color difference maps show distinctive sensor
response patterns that are unique to each DHB, which allows distinguishing
them qualitatively even without statistical techniques. As mentioned
earlier, the spectral changes observed against THB and THBA are different
from those observed for DHBs.

of 2DHB, 3DHB,
and 4DHB and pyrogallol and gallic acid as potential interferences.

DHB Calibration Curves
The correlation between overall
array responses was probed as a function of DHB concentration (Figure S5). The calculated calibration curves
based on the largest response among the five sensor elements for the
determination of each DHB show linear regimes of 10–800, 1–100,
and 1–800 μM for 2DHB, 3DHB, and 4DHB, respectively (Figure S6). The limits of detection (LODs) are
summarized in Table 1. On the basis of the results, not only are LODs comparable with
a variety of methods reported recently in the literature for the determination
of DHBs but they also meet the requirements for the detection of DHBs
in applications.

Five Sensor Elements
 	2DHB	3DHB	4DHB	
linear range (μM)	10–800	1–100	1–800	
LOD (μM)	9.2	0.7	0.9	
Discrimination
of DHB Mixtures
Discrimination of DHB
mixtures is far more challenging than pure DHBs yet essential because
of the fact that mixtures of DHBs are usually present in real samples.
To investigate the ability of the proposed array in this dimension,
the response of the sensor in the binary and ternary combinations
of DHBs was recorded. It was found that binary mixtures of 2DHB, 3DHB,
and 4DHB at 40 μM with a molar ratio of 1:1 and also the ternary
mixture of them with molar ratios of 1:1:1, 2:1:1, and 1:2:2 have
different responses compared with their pure forms (Figure S7). All DHB mixtures were located distinctly in independent
clusters in the canonical score plot, and the cross-validation accuracy
of identification was found to be 100% (Figure 8A,B). Moreover, the obtained scores of the
mixtures were located between the scores of their individual components
on the score plot. As shown in Figure 8C, these mixtures as well as pure DHBs were clearly
distinguished from each other in the color difference map, demonstrating
a 100% correct classification.

score plots,
illustrating the discrimination of individual DHBs from their binary
and ternary mixtures at DHB concentrations of 40 and 80 μM.

Detection of DHBs in Real
Samples
The performance of
our designed sensing array was further evaluated for the discrimination
of DHBs in skin bleaching cream and tap water. In this regard, various
sensor elements were applied to the cream and tap water spiked with
80 μM DHBs (Figure S8). As shown
in Figure 9, each of
the DHBs in water samples generates a distinct response and a 100%
identification accuracy was obtained for all DHBs. Moreover, the skin
bleaching cream sample containing hydroquinone is clustered in the
group of 4DHB. These findings reveal the high potential of the sensor
array to discriminate DHBs in real-world samples.

after combining the test set (real sample)
with the training set data. Tap water samples were spiked with DHBs
at concentrations of 60 and 80 μM, and the plot shows the cream
clustered in the 4DHB group, which is in agreement with its ingredient.

Conclusions
In
summary, a novel chrono-CSA is developed for kinetic discrimination
of DHB structural isomers at a concentration range of 1–800
μM. Four sensor elements at different AuNR-to-silver ion concentration
ratios were employed for the discrimination of DHBs. DHB isomers including
catechol and hydroquinone, as a reducing agent, are capable of reducing
silver ions (Ag+) to silver atoms (Ag0) with
different kinetics at neutral pHs, leading to anisotropic growth of
silver on the surface of AuNRs. The chronochromic behaviors of AuNRs
against DHBs are completely different, which seems to be due to the
distinct redox potentials of the target analytes. Furthermore, AgNP
formation strategy at a basic medium, as a fifth sensor element, was
employed to improve the discrimination capability of the colorimetric
sensor array. Moreover, the array could efficiently discriminate among
individual DHBs and their mixtures. Finally, the DHBs in real samples
were well-distinguished with a 100% discrimination accuracy, which
further validates the practical application of this chrono-CSA.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (HAuCl4·3H2O) (99.5%), trisodium citrate, sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), hydrochloric acid (HCl 37%), 2DHB, 3DHB, 4DHB, pyrogallol
(THB), gallic acid (THBA), sodium borohydride (NaBH4),
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), 5-bromosalicylic acid (5-Br-SA),
AA, and ethanol were purchased from Merck. Milli-Q grade water, with
a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ, was used in all experiments.

Instrumentation
Absorbance spectra were recorded using
a PerkinElmer (LAMBDA25) spectrophotometer with the use of a 1.0 cm
glass cell. Measurements of pH were performed with a Denver Instrument
model of 270 pH meter equipped with a Metrohm glass electrode. TEM
images were recorded with a Zeiss EM900 microscope (Germany) at an
accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

Synthesis of High-AR AuNRs
A stock solution of AuNRs
stabilized with CTAB was synthesized using the existing seed-mediated
growth method with minor modification.52 Briefly, seed solution was prepared by mixing 5.0 mL of 0.1 M CTAB
with a 0.05 mL solution of 2.5 × 10–2 M HAuCl4, followed by injection of 0.3 mL of 0.01 M freshly prepared
ice-cold NaBH4 under vigorous stirring. The resulted brownish-yellow
solution was aged for 2 h at room temperature before use. For growth
solution, 0.015 g of 5-Br-SA was added to 50 mL of 0.05 M CTAB under
gentle stirring. This was followed by the addition of 1.15 mL of 0.01
M AgNO3. Then, 1 mL of 2.5 × 10–2 M HAuCl4, 0.40 mL of HCl (37 wt % in water, 12.1 M),
and 0.30 mL of 0.10 M AA were successively added. Finally, 0.06 mL
of the seed solution was injected into the solution under gentle stirring.
The color of the solution gradually changed within 1 h, and the solution
was kept overnight at room temperature. The AuNRs were collected by
centrifugation (5000 rpm, 10 min) and redispersion in Milli-Q water
twice.

Fabrication of Chrono-CSA and Data Acquisition
Totally
five sensing elements (SE1–SE5), including silver nitrate (5
× 10–4 M) in the presence of four concentrations
of AuNRs (1.25 × 10–11, 6.25 × 10–12, 3.25 × 10–12, and 1.5 ×
10–12 M) and silver nitrate (5 × 10–4 M) in the presence of sodium citrate (5 × 10–3 M) and sodium hydroxide (10–3 M), were utilized
to fabricate the colorimetric sensor array for discrimination of DHBs.
Then, different concentrations of target analytes were added to each
sensor in a final volume of 1 mL, and UV–vis spectra were recorded
after 1, 5, and 10 min of incubation. All experiments were performed
in triplicate. The chemometric analyses were carried out using MATLAB
R2014b (version 8.4) and SYSTAT (version 13.0).

Real-Sample
Analysis
Identification of DHB isomers
in tap water and skin bleaching cream (2% 4DHB) samples was explored
to investigate the potential applicability of the proposed array.
Tap water samples were spiked with 80 μM 2DHB, 3DHB, and 4DHB.
The cream sample was prepared as follows:53 100 mg of cream was weighed and dissolved in methanol and diluted
to 9 mL with methanol in 10 mL centrifuge tubes. It was then extracted
by ultrasonication for 10 min, centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 10 min,
and then filtration through a 0.45 μm syringe filter. Stock
solution of the cream was obtained by diluting 500 μL of extracted
solutions with deionized water to 10 mL. Then, the aforementioned
analyses for DHB isomer detection were performed on tap water and
cream samples (in triplicate).
