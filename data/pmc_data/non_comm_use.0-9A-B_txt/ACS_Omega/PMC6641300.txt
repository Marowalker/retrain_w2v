Selective detection
of biothiols holds prime importance owing to
the role of varied concentrations of biothiols in various diseases,
thus demanding extensive research for developing materials toward
selective sensing. In this study, we targeted postsynthetic modification
(PSM) approach for imparting desired functionality to chemically stable
UiO-66-NH2 metal–organic framework, which exhibits
highly selective sensing toward biothiols. The appended dinitrobenzenesulfonyl
group reacts with biothiols via chemidosimetric approach. As a consequence,
the probe exhibits a turn on response, which holds immense importance
for facile biological studies.

Introduction
Cysteine and glutathione
among other biothiols play a vital role
in the human physiology and biological activities, and their deficiency
has been linked to various neurodegenerative disorders.1,2 These biothiols are known to serve in various cellular activities,
for example, cysteine serves as a precursor to glutathione that maintains
the redox activity within the cellular environment. This feature makes
it very important in the maintenance of cellular stress. Deficiency
in the cysteine content within the cells leads to retarded growth,
liver damage, impaired antioxidant defenses, depressed immune functions,
etc. On the other hand, glutathione maintains the levels of cysteine
(reduced form) by controlling the redox environment within the intracellular
compartments. Oxidative stress management is performed by glutathione
via radical ion-trapping mechanism. These biothiols are also involved
in internal cellular transduction and pose interference in molecular
recognition.3,4 Hence, it is crucial to develop
biocompatible materials for measuring their concentration within intracellular
environments. Cysteine concentrations are directly linked with various
diseases, making it significant to develop probes for detection of
such thiols via intracellular bioimaging.

Until now various
methods have been developed for sensing of biothiols
like capillary electrophoresis, high-performance liquid chromatography,
UV/vis spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, electrochemical methods, etc.5−7 These methods pose limitations such as high experimental costs,
complex sample processing, etc., making them difficult for use in
real-time cellular analysis. However, fluorescence-based methods have
gained significant attention owing to various advantages, including
highly sensitive and selective detection, facile experimentation technique,
high cost efficiency, and instant data procurement for rapid analysis
essential for real-time biological sample analysis.8,9 Luminescence-based
sensing involves two kinds of approach: (1) interaction-based, wherein
changes within the highest occupied molecular orbital–lowest
unoccupied molecular orbital band gap of the donor acceptor leads
to generation of signal in form of different photoluminescence emission
profiles and (2) reaction-based, wherein analyte selectively reacts
with the probe, leading to signal generation. To impart high selectivity
to the fluorescent probes, reaction-based approach, that is, “chemidosimetric
approach” offers a great deal of advantage in terms of selectivity
over other known methods due to the presence of functionalized receptors
mimicking lock and key model in the enzymatic reactions in the biological
systems.10,11 Thus, dual facet combining the facile measureable
technique and the highly selective reaction-based approach may offer
exciting results in the field of sensing of biothiols. Fluorescence-based
probes offer another significant advantage as being a noninvasive
technique; thus, development of such probes for real-time biothiols
sensing within the intracellular fluids should be explored.12 In the literature, various small molecule/organic
probes for biothiol sensing are available, but these probes offer
disadvantage as they tend to aggregate and are less soluble in water
medium, thus making organic-based probes difficult for its utilization
in real-time applications.13 Hence, there
is a need for development of novel materials for analyte recognition.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), evolved as a class of potentially
porous materials, have shown extensive applications in the fields
of sorption, sensing, catalysis, etc.14−16 MOFs are extended frameworks
constructed from organic linkers and metal ions, wherein the organic
linkers can be functionalized to impart specificity.17 MOFs have exhibited tremendous potential in the field of
sensing owing to the presence of nanocavities with highly aligned
recognition sites combined with the preconcentration effect, thus
leading to fast response mechanism.18−21 To tune the selectivity and sensitivity
of a probe, linker design strategy plays a vital role due to the facile
tunable nature.22 To assign specific functionality,
linkers can be functionalized via two approaches: presynthetic approach
and postsynthetic approach. The presynthetic approach involves functionalization
of linker with appended functionalities prior to MOF synthesis.23 Linker functionalization via postsynthetic modification
(PSM) was pioneered by Cohen and co-workers.24,25 Until now, numerous reports have shown the distinct advantage of
postsynthetic modification in MOFs that leads to superior performance
compared to the pristine MOF.26 The PSM
approach plays a pivotal role in sensing applications by imparting
selective recognition sites post MOF synthesis.27 Thus, MOFs can act as nanoluminescent cavity with appended
functionalities for photoluminescence-based studies in real-time applications.28 MOFs can be well dispersed in water and thus
pose an advantage for such analysis. For biothiol sensing, we sought
to incorporate functional sites specific for biothiols. Although there
are a few reports that have shown selective sensing of biothiols,
extensive developments are demanded.29,30 Existing literature
revealed various organic reaction-based probes, but we restricted
our search for probes that behave in a turn on fashion. It is well
known that probes that respond in a “turn on” fashion
can be studied with ease within the biological systems due to high
signal-to-noise ratio as measurement occurs against a dark background.
Enthused from this, we sought targeted attachment of highly electron-withdrawing
functional groups like 2,4-dinitrosulfonyl chloride (DNS), which is
known as a highly specific and selective probe for biothiols (Figure 1).31

Figure 1 Schematic representation showing mechanistic pathway followed by
UiO-66-DNS for biothiols sensing.

Results and Discussion
The proposed idea was to integrate
the specificity of the reaction
and immobilization of the functional group that may exhibit a faster
turn on response (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Scheme Depicting Selective Sensing of Biothiols in
Aqueous Phase
by Postsynthetically Modified MOF
Among other requirements, the nontoxic nature of probe
is essential
in real-time biological system; hence, we chose UiO-66-NH2, a highly robust Zr-MOF, known for its wide range of chemical stability,
as a template for postsynthetic modification.32 UiO-66-NH2 was synthesized via a solvothermal method
by a reported procedure.33 Initial characterization
by powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) revealed its bulk phase purity
(Figure 2A). The as-made
compound was desolvated following reported procedure for performing
the postsynthetic modification (Figure S3). As strategized, UiO-66-NH2 was postsynthetically modified
by reaction with dinitrosulfonyl chloride at room temperature to yield
UiO-66-DNS (Experimental Section, SI). To evaluate framework integrity post reaction,
characterization of UiO-66-DNS was performed using PXRD, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR),
energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry, elemental analysis, and
field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). PXRD analysis
revealed integrity of framework after PSM with retention of the highly
crystalline nature of the sample (Figure S1).

Figure 2 (A) Powder X-ray diffraction patterns and (B) photoluminescence
profiles of UiO-66-DNS after cysteine addition.

FT-IR spectra showed peaks around ∼1160 cm–1 for the stretching frequency of S–O bond and around ∼1350
cm–1 for N–O bond for the incorporation of
DNS (Figure 3A). Elemental
analysis showed sulfur content, which can be correlated to the successful
grafting of DNS group to amine sites. Thermogravimetric analysis exhibited
an initial weight loss of 12% owing to the presence of occluded solvent
molecules during the postsynthetic modification protocol. UiO-66-DNS
was activated at 120 °C, thus obtaining an activated phase of
the material (Figure S3). FESEM analysis
revealed that the morphology of the sample was maintained, and EDX
analysis revealed sulfur content as anticipated (Figure S4). Thus, successful fabrication of UiO-66-DNS was
characterized thoroughly by the above-mentioned techniques. UiO-66-DNS
was probed by UV–vis spectroscopy, which showed maximum absorbance
wavelength around (λmax ∼ 350 nm) (Figure 3B). For an initial
check regarding the performance of the probe for biothiol sensing,
UiO-66-DNS was dispersed in water and photoluminescence profile was
recorded upon excitation at ∼325 nm after addition of 20 μL
of cysteine solution with a buffer time of 2 min. Photoluminescence
profile showed emission spectra with the peak maximum (λmax) centered around ∼432 nm (Figure 2B). After consecutive addition of 200 μL
of cysteine, an overall ∼48-fold enhancement in intensity profile
was observed (Figure 2B).

Figure 3 (A) Fourier transform infrared patterns for as-synthesized and
postsynthetically modified MOF. (B) UV/vis absorption spectra of as-synthesized,
postsynthetically modified, and thiol-treated MOF.

This change may be attributed to the release of
highly electron-deficient
DNS moiety that quenches the fluorescence intensity of the initial
probe. (Figure 1).

Stability of the framework was examined after treatment of UiO-66-DNS
with cysteine and glutathione. PXRD analysis confirmed the retention
of the framework with the pattern showing highly crystalline nature
(Figure S2). TGA also showed a similar
pattern to UiO-66-NH2, from which it can be inferred that
the framework exhibits a similar thermal stability profile (Figure S3). Retention of morphology was also
confirmed by FESEM analysis, wherein UiO-66-DNS and cysteine-treated
UiO-66-DNS showed the similar hexagonal-shaped morphology (Figure S6). Inspired from the above results for
cysteine sensing, we sought to test the effect of other biothiols
like glutathione, which is large in size compared to cysteine (Figure S18). Photoluminescence studies were carried
out in water medium in dispersed phase. The photoluminescence profile
exhibited smooth emission at ∼432 nm (Figure S9). Upon successive addition of 20 μL of glutathione
and recording photoluminescence profile after an equilibration time
of 2 min, we observed an overall ∼26-fold enhancement in photoluminescence
due to the release of electron-deficient DNS group (Figure S9). The enhancement in luminescence was also visible
to the naked eye under UV light. In terms of kinetics of the probe,
UiO-66-DNS showed faster response toward cysteine compared to glutathione
in terms of the extent of enhancement. This observation can be explained
by comparing the analytes in terms of sterics (Figure S18). The less bulkier cysteine molecule may exhibit
facile diffusion and thus can interact easily with the reaction probe,
leading to considerably higher enhancement in photoluminescence intensity.
Glutathione being bulkier in size may have restricted diffusion and
consequently less interactions with the appended reaction sites, leading
to less enhancement in photoluminescence intensity. The sensitivity
of probe is an important criterion for analyzing the probe performance.
Hence, limit of detection (LOD) calculations were performed according
to reported protocols and the value was found to be around 9.8 μM
for cysteine sensing29 (Figure S17). This low detection limit can be attributed to
prealigned reaction centers present within the nanosized porous cavities
of the framework that may lead to a fast intramolecular charge-transfer
(ICT) process occurring between the linker and the DNS moiety. Upon
removal of strong electron-withdrawing DNS moiety (Figure 1), the ICT may get quenched,
thus leading to a significant enhancement in intensity profile. Both
sensitivity and selectivity play a vital role in the design of sensory
probe. To check the selectivity of the probe, we analyzed the photoluminescence
performance of the probe UiO-66-DNS in the presence of other amino
acids, keeping the concentration constant. As anticipated, other amino
acids like phenylalanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, tryptophan,
and glycine showed negligible enhancement in the fluorescence intensity
of UiO-66-DNS (Figures S9–S14).
The performance of other amino acids was recorded after adding 200
μL of various amino acid solution to 2 mg of UiO-66-DNS; thereafter,
photoluminescence profile was recorded after an equilibration time
of 2 min. No substantial enhancement in the luminescence intensity
was observed (Figure 4). The observed selectivity can be attributed to the presence of
prealigned highly reactive functional sites, i.e., dinitrobenzenesulfonyl
chloride moiety, which selectively reacts with the thiol functionality
of cysteine, thus exhibiting selectivity over other amino acids. From
this, we conclude the importance of the reaction-based approach in
MOFs for imparting high selectivity and sensitivity. Further, this
probe may be utilized for in vivo cell imaging for measuring cysteine
concentration as cysteine holds tremendous significance because its
concentration has been linked to various diseases.

various amino acids.

In summary, we have functionalized UiO-66-NH2 via
postsynthetic
modification for imparting selectivity for biothiol sensing. As anticipated,
the probe exhibited selective and specific sensing toward biothiols
over other amino acids. We believe that the organic functionalization
approach to impart selective sites of recognition within the nano
porous domains of MOF leads to an appreciable value of LOD ∼
1.18 ppm. We hope this report stimulates research within the field
of MOF for selective recognition of various biologically relevant
amino acids.

Experimental Section
Materials
2-Aminoterephthalic
acid and 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl
chloride were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. ZrCl4 was purchased
from Merck. All dry solvents and other chemicals were procured locally.
All of these chemicals were used without further purification.

Physical
Measurements
All fluorescence measurements
were done on a Jobin Yvon Fluoromax-4 spectrofluorometer. Powder X-ray
diffraction patterns were recorded on a Bruker D8 Advanced X-ray diffractometer
using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å) in the 5–40°
2θ range. The IR spectra were acquired using a NICOLET 6700
FT-IR spectrophotometer using KBr pellet in the 400–4000 cm–1 range. Solid-state UV–visible spectra were
recorded on a PerkinElmer UV–visible spectrometer. Gas adsorption
measurements were studied using a BELSORP-max instrument from Bel
Japan. The SEM images were obtained using an FEI Quanta three-dimensional
dual beam Fourier transform scanning electron microscope at 30 kV.

Synthesis of UiO-66-NH2 (1)
UiO-66-NH2 was synthesized according to a slightly modified
previously reported protocol.33 A mixture
of ZrCl4 (83 mg, 0.35 mmol) and 2-aminoterephthalic acid
(63 mg, 0.35 mmol) was dissolved in 4 mL of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and the resulting solution was
placed in a Teflon-lined Parr stainless steel vessel (17 mL) and sealed.
The sealed vessel was then placed in an oven and allowed to heat at
120 °C for 24 h. After slow cooling to room temperature, a pale
yellow crystalline powder (1) was isolated by filtration
and further washed with DMF and MeOH three times. Thereafter, 1 was dipped in MeOH for exchange. The MeOH-exchanged MOF
was filtered and heated at 100 °C under vacuum for 12 h to get
guest-free UiO-66-NH2 (1). The thus obtained 1 was used for all measurements.

Synthesis of Postsynthetically
Modified UiO-66-NH2-PSM (1-PSM)
UiO-66-DNSCl
was synthesized via
a slightly modified already reported protocol.34 UiO-66-NH2 (100 mg, 0.37 mmol), 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl
chloride (117.3 mg, 0.44 mmol), and dichloromethane (5 mL) were taken
in a 50 mL round-bottom flask. The above mixture was maintained at
0 °C, and pyridine (44 μL, 0.55 mmol) was added subsequently
under stirring conditions for 1 h. Further, the reaction mixture was
filtered and washed with water and acetone and activated at 120 °C
for 24 h.

Preparation of the Analytes
Cysteine, glutathione,
phenylalanine, leucine, valine, isoleucine, tryptophan, and glycine
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich were used as received.

For photoluminescence
studies, 1 mM stock solution of various amino acids was prepared in
distilled water, and 2 mg of MOF was used for all of the photoluminescence
and absorption studies.
