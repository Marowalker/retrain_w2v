An inorganic sol–gel polymerization
process was used as
a cross-linking reaction during three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting
of cell-containing hydrogel scaffolds. Hybrid hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose (HPMC), with a controlled ratio of silylation, was prepared
and isolated as a 3D-network precursor. When dissolved in a biological
buffer containing human mesenchymal stem cells, it yields a bioink
that can be printed during polymerization by extrusion. It is worth
noting that the sol–gel process proceeded at pH 7.4 using biocompatible
mode of catalysis (NaF and glycine). The printing window was determined
by rheology and viscosity measurements. The physicochemical properties
of hydrogels were studied. Covalent functionalization of the network
can be easily performed by adding a triethoxysilyl-containing molecule;
a fluorescent hybrid molecule was used as a proof of concept.

Introduction
Thanks to the affordability
of three-dimensional (3D) printers,
the simplicity of the process, and its compatibility with a large
number of biopolymers, extrusion-based printing has emerged as a method
of choice for rapid fabrication of hydrogel constructs.1 As a direct ink writing (DIW) technology, a continuous
filament of material is extruded out of a nozzle on a print head moved
in the x/y/z direction
to construct the desired shape, layer-by-layer. This automated technology
is the most common for the reproducible 3D printing of materials in
the biofabrication field. When printed with a biocompatible and cell-adherent
material, the surface of any scaffold can be easily seeded with cells.
However, the embedment of cells within the material is required for
most advanced tissue engineering applications.2−4 Indeed, the
culture of cells in three dimensions is required to mimic a natural
tissue and only hydrogels can be used as such extracellular matrix
(ECM) surrogates.5−7 Printer cartridges have to be filled with a cell-containing
buffer, hydrogel precursors, and any other additional components to
impart the desired physiochemical, mechanical, and biological properties
to the resulting 3D-printed scaffold.8 This
cell-containing printable mixture is named a bioink. Physical hydrogels
obtained from natural biopolymers (i.e., alginate9−13 and collagen14−17) dominate the field. However, when long-lasting scaffolds
have to be printed for more demanding tissue engineering applications,
covalent chemical hydrogels have to be considered. The establishment
of covalent bonds in a bioink has to go through biorthogonal reactions
with good control of the kinetics and increased viscosity. Michael
additions (i.e., radical thiol-ene and thiol maleimide addition) as
well as photopolymerization of acrylates are widely used. Numerous
3D printers are equipped with UV illumination devices, supporting
the popularity of photopolymerization even when organic catalysts
are required.

Herein, we propose an alternative approach based
on sol–gel
inorganic polymerization. Interestingly, we have already demonstrated
that sol–gel hydrolysis and polycondensation of trialkoxysilane
units linked to organic cores (e.g., peptides18 and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG))19,20 can be performed
at 37 °C, at pH 7 in an aqueous buffer, in the presence of cells
thanks to the use of nontoxic amounts of fluoride and glycine as catalysts.21 In this study, we designed a polysaccharide-based
bioink that was used for the extrusion-based 3D bioprinting of human
mesenchyme stromal cells (hMSCs). As a first model of a silylated
biopolymer, we chose hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC, Mn = 10 000 g/mol). Hybrid HPMC hydrogels
have already been described for cell encapsulation of rabbit chondrocytes.22 Nonetheless, the method used for the introduction
of silane groups and for the hydrogel formation did not allow the
prior preparation of a bioink at physiological pH. Indeed, functionalization
of the polymer, followed by hydrolysis, and condensation of alkoxysilanes
occurred at the same time in a noncontrolled way, resulting in an
insoluble precursor at physiological pH. Dissolving had to be performed
at basic pH (>12), and a neutralization step was necessary before
cell addition.

On the contrary, we looked toward establishing
a bottom-up, block-wise,
and modular-based strategy. Ideally, every single component of the
bioink (i.e., multifunctionalized network bricks, monosilylated peptide
ligands, fluorophores, and drugs) should be available as isolated
triethoxysilyl derivatives on the shelf, to be chosen in an appropriate
ratio, and finally mixed in a cell-containing buffer at physiological
pH to obtain the final hydrogel. Accordingly, we first synthesized
an HPMC bearing triethoxysilyl units (HPMC-Si). The silylation ratio
had to be determined precisely to reach an accurate reticulation control
and, consequently, to control the mechanical properties of the resulting
hydrogel network.

Experimental Section
Materials and Methods
All reagents and solvents were
purchased from Alfa Aesar, Acros, Sigma-Aldrich, or Merck and were
used without further purification.

HPMC-Si 2 Synthesis
Hydroxypropyl methyl
cellulose (HPMC) (10 000 g/mol, 10 g, 0.03 mol) was dried in
an oven overnight at 80 °C and dissolved in anhydrous dimethylformamide
(DMF) (100 mL) under argon. Triethylamine (1.66 mL, 12 mmol, 12 equiv)
and 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane (ICPTES) (16.75 mL, 0.12 mol,
4 equiv) were added. The mixture was heated at 70 °C for 48 h.
Progress of silylation was monitored by 1H NMR in DMF (Figure S1). Then, the solvents were removed under
reduced pressure and the reaction mixture was precipitated in diethyl
ether. The white solid was washed three times with diethyl ether and
vacuum-dried. Hybrid HPMC-Si 2 was then stored at 4 °C
under argon.

HPMC-Si 4 Synthesis
The synthesis of HPMC-Si 4 (Figure S5) was achieved following
a previously described procedure.23

Briefly, HPMC (10 000 g/mol, 10 g, 0.03 mol) was dried in
an oven overnight at 80 °C and suspended in heptane and propanol
(80:20 (v/v)) (75 and 19 mL, respectively). Sodium hydroxide was added
(0.48 g, 0.012 mol, 0.4 equiv), and the mixture was kept at room temperature
(RT) for 45 min under nitrogen bubbling. (3-Glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane
(GPTMS) was added dropwise under argon, and the temperature was increased
until 100 °C over 35 min. Boiling was continued for 3 h. Heating
was stopped, and the mixture was allowed to cool to 40 °C before
adding glacial acetic acid (1.2 mL, 0.02 mol, 0.7 equiv) for neutralization.
After 30 min, the mixture was filtered on a Buchner funnel and rinsed
two times with 200 mL of acetone. The white powder was dried at 50
°C in an oven for 1 h. The dried powder was washed successively
three times with 500 mL of an acetone/water mixture (80:20 (v/v))
and dried at 50 °C overnight.

Hybrid Hydrogel Synthesis
HPMC-Si was poured in Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) (pH 7.4, 150 g/L) and stirred for
12 h. Then, a solution of NaF and/or glycine (conditions A, B, or
C) was added to obtain a final HPMC-Si concentration of 135 g/L (13.5
wt %, 0.35 mM; a volume of 5–20 mL was commonly used). The
viscous solution was quickly centrifuged to eliminate air bubbles
formed during dissolution.

Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was performed on a PerkinElmer TGA6 instrument between
30 and 600 °C under air at a heating rate of 2 °C/min.

Rheology
All measurements were done on an HR-2 rheometer
from TA Instruments.

The gel point and viscoelastic behavior
were measured by Small-Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS) experiments.

A macroindentation experiment was performed on a formed HPMC-Si
hydrogel (5 mL) poured in a 33.5 mm well. The indentation test was
performed with a duralumin cylinder connected at one end to a stress-controlled
rheometer and presenting a circular flat surface on the other end
(diameter 10 mm). The speed of descent was set to 0.7 mm/s.

Viscosimetry
Viscosity measurements were performed
using an SV-10 sine-wave vibro viscometer (A&D) equipped with
a 10 mL sample beaker (polycarbonate). The sample cup was filled with
10 mL of the hydrogel and fitted with a water jacket connected to
a water tank. The temperature was set at 37 °C. Viscosity was
recorded automatically every 60 s. Full sets of data are presented
in Figure S15.

Mesh Size
Two
methods were used to determine the mesh
size (ξ): by rheology or by swelling studies (see details in
the Supporting Information).

Swelling Studies
HPMC-Si 2 hydrogels were
cut into 1 cm2 pieces and freeze-dried. The initial weight
(mdried) was measured. Then, dried hydrogels
were incubated in DPBS at room temperature overnight. Prior to being
weighed (mwet), rehydrated hydrogels were
quickly blotted with filter paper to remove excess surface water.
The mass swelling ratio (%) was calculated as described in eq 9 in the Supporting Information.

Eight
measurements were made and averaged. mdried = 41.1 ± 3.7 mg; mwet = 138.9 ±
16.9 mg

Cryo-SEM
The HPMC-Si 2 hydrogel (13.5
wt %) was analyzed by cryo-SEM. The sample was frozen in slush nitrogen,
fractured, sublimated for 5 min at −98 °C, coated with
palladium, and analyzed at 5 kV on an FEI Quanta 250 Scanning Electron
Microscope equipped with an Alto 2500 cryo-transfer system (GATAN).

3D Printing
All of the printing assays were performed
at RT on a BioBots 1 (Allevi 1) bioprinter (Allevi, Philadelphia,
PA). The bioink was placed in a clear 10 mL syringe barrel equipped
with a 27 G conical dispensing tip, and the temperature was maintained
at 37 °C. Scaffolds were printed on microscope glass slides at
10 mm/s with an applied pressure of 45 ± 5 psi. The script was
written and visualized with Slic3R. The printer was controlled using
Machine tool software.

Fluorescein Isothiocyanate (FITC) Silylation
The silylation
of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) (compound 5) was
achieved following a previously described procedure.24

FITC (25 mg, 0.064 mmol) was first dissolved in anhydrous
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (300 μL) under argon. (3-Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane
(APTES) (33.2 μL, 0.141 mmol, 2.2 equiv) was added, and the
reaction occurred at room temperature for 1 h. The reaction mixture
was then directly precipitated in diethyl ether. The yellow solid
was washed three times with diethyl ether and vacuum-dried.

Fluorescein
Release Study
HPMC-Si 2 was
dissolved in DPBS (3 mL) as described above. Catalysis condition C
(NaF 0.1 g/L + glycine 100 g/L) and compound 5 or fluorescein
(compound 6) were added (1.7 mM) and dissolved. Gelation
occurred at room temperature (RT) overnight. Then, the gel tablets
were placed in different flasks with 10 mL of DPBS and stored at room
temperature. DPBS was regularly removed and replaced by fresh DPBS.
The release of fluorescein was measured by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) from collected solutions of DPBS.

Results
and Discussion
We have performed the reaction of the secondary
alcohol functions
of HPMC with 3-isocyanatopropyl triethoxysilane (ICPTES) (Figure 1) in anhydrous DMF
in the presence of triethylamine at 70 °C. Silylation was completed
after 8 h (see the Supporting Information, Figure S1). HPMC-Si was precipitated by the addition of diethyl ether,
washed, and dried under vacuum.

(down) of hybrid silylated HPMC, an example for HPMC-Si 2. Anomeric protons are represented in blue (near to 4.5 ppm) and
α/β-methylene protons CH2CH2Si in
red (near to 0.62 and 1.45 ppm). Attributed protons (a–g) are
annotated on the structure.

Different silylation rates were obtained by varying the ICPTES
amount from 0.2 to 1 equiv (HPMC-Si 1, 2, and 3) depending on the HPMC repetition unit (332
g/mol). The silylation rate was measured from 1H and 13C quantitative NMR spectra (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2). Briefly, chemical shifts of anomeric
protons (in blue, close to 4.5 ppm) and α/β-methylene
protons CH2CH2Si (in red, between 0.75 and 1.6
ppm) were determined by two-dimensional (2D) NMR heteronuclear single-quantum
correlation (HSQC) experiments (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3). No other proton signal was detected
in these chemical shift ranges. The ratio of silylated chains was
calculated by quantitative one-dimensional (1D) NMR (Table 1). Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) performed on HPMC-Si precursors yielded silylation rates in
good agreement with those obtained from NMR spectra (see the Supporting
Information, Figure S10), ranging from
7 to 56% of silylation per repetition unit (Table 1). It is noteworthy that the reaction yield
was ∼50% whatever the equivalent of ICPTES used (e.g., compound 2 prepared with 0.4 equiv of ICPTES showed 21% of silylation
compared to a theoretical maximum of 40%). As a control, HPMC-Si 4 was synthesized as previously published23 using (3-glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GPTMS) as
a silylation agent in a heterogeneous medium (28% silylation rate)
(see the Supporting Information, Figures S6, S8, and S9). As expected, the resulting product was not soluble
(in contrast to compounds 1–3) and
had to be dissolved at an extremely basic pH (>12.5) and then neutralized
to allow the formation of a hydrogel. We suspected premature hydrolysis
and condensation of trimethoxysilane of HPMC-Si 4 that
occurred during the neutralization step. In addition, this one step
cannot guarantee that all GMTPS reacted with HPMC. Indeed, unreacted
and hydrolyzed GPTMS can take part in the Si–O–Si covalent
network during the sol–gel process.

b % = 100 × [area (c + d)/2]/[area
f].

To prove this hypothesis,
HPMC-Si 4 was dissolved
in NaOD/D2O and diffusion-ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) NMR
was performed (see the Supporting Information, Figure S7). The spectra clearly show the presence of two components:
high-molecular-weight HPMC-Si and a low-molecular-weight component
corresponding to hydrolyzed silylating reagent GPTMS, which did not
react with the HPMC backbone.

HPMC-Si 2 (∼21%
of silylation) was selected
as the bioink component. The new average molecular weight of the repetition
unit is 384 g/mol (332 × 0.79 + 579.4 × 0.21). This polymer
should be able to give one reticulation node of HPMC, each 7.4 nm.
This reticulation level was in the same range as the previously described
HPMC-Si used for cell encapsulation.18

1H NMR and 29Si NMR (see the Supporting Information, Figure S4) showed that HPMC-Si 2 was obtained as a nonhydrolyzed and uncondensed triethoxysilane
precursor (Figure 1, 1H NMR signals a and b, and a single peak in the 29Si NMR spectra at −41.5 ppm). The 29Si
NMR spectrum of HPMC-Si 4 also shows only one species
of silicon at −42.4 ppm (see the Supporting Information, Figure S9). This is because this HPMC-Si has
to be dissolved in basic conditions, giving only one silicon species:
silanolates. To achieve a more accurate determination of the alkoxysilane
state, 29Si solid-state NMR studies were performed on compounds 2 and 4. As expected, one single species of silicon
was detected for compound 2 (−45 ppm) and attributed
to T0 substructures [−Si(OEt)3]. The
absence of Tn (n = 1,
2, and 3) confirmed the absence of hydrolysis and condensation (Figure 2). In contrast, no
T0 substructure was detected, while T2 and T3 were predominant in HPMC-Si 4, highlighting
the lack of control in HPMC silylation, leading to a nonsoluble HPMC-Si
hybrid material.

Figure 2 Solid-state 29Si NMR of HPMC-Si 2 (blue
spectrum) and HPMC-Si 4 (red spectrum). Only T0 species are observed for HPMC-Si 2 (no Si–O–Si
species), while T1, T2, and T3 species
are observed for HPMC-Si 4.

Three different conditions were used to catalyze the sol–gel
formation of hydrogel from HPMC-Si (Table 2).

HPMC-Si 2 was poured in pH 7.4 Dulbecco’s
phosphate-buffered
saline (DPBS) and stirred for 12 h. Then, a solution of NaF and/or
glycine (conditions A, B, or C) was added to obtain a final HPMC-Si
concentration of 135 g/L (13.5 wt %, 0.35 M of RU; a volume of 5–20
mL was commonly used). The viscous solution was quickly centrifuged
to eliminate air bubbles trapped during dissolution.

In all
cases, hydrolysis and condensation allowed the formation
of Si–O–Si bridges and the formation of a translucent
hybrid hydrogel. Storage (or elastic shear) modulus G′ and loss modulus G″ were recorded
during gelation by Small-Amplitude Oscillatory Shear (SAOS) experiments
on an HR-2 rheometer. Two characteristic G′
values were pointed out: the “gel point”, which corresponded
to the intersection between G′ and G″ curves at which the solution still flowed, and
the “macroscopic gel point”, at G′
= 100 Pa, where the solution no longer flowed and the hydrogel was
formed.

The gel point was found to be nearly the same for the
three conditions
(see the Supporting Information, Figures S11–S13). This point can be explained by the formation of large colloidal
particles inducing an increase of the storage modulus. Otherwise,
the macroscopic gel point time was greatly impacted by varying the
NaF concentration: 206 min for condition A and 315 min for condition
B. More interestingly, glycine (condition C) acts as a cocatalyst
for the cross-linking between the colloids and speeds up gelation
(macroscopic gel point at 143 min) while keeping the NaF concentration
as low as 0.1 mg/mL.

To determine the optimal printing window,
extrusion-printing assays
were performed using a BioBots 3D device. Simultaneously, the evolution
of viscosity over time was recorded using an SV-10 sine-wave vibro
viscometer (see the Supporting Information, Figure S15). A continuous filament of HPMC-Si could be ideally extruded
between 160 and 260 min (i.e., just after reaching the macroscopic
gel point). Indeed, before 160 min, HPMC-Si flowed after extrusion.
On the other hand, after 260 min, the hydrogel was too stiff and led
to irregular, broken pieces of ribbons going out of the nozzle. This
“printing window” corresponded to viscosity values ranging
from 1500 to 7300 mPa s (Figure 3).

of time (down). Viscosity, red trace; storage modulus (G′), blue trace. The printing window is experimentally set
between 160 and 260 min.

Macroindentation was
performed on the HPMC-Si 2 hydrogel.
This method provides a way to characterize both the compression elastic
properties (compressive strain: ε) and the mechanical resistance
of the soft material (normal stress: σ). In the first moments
of deformation (below 5% deformation), the linear low-strain regime
provides a way to define an apparent elastic modulus (E* = δσ/δε) and, after calculation, Young’s
modulus E.25,26 This value gives information
about the rigidity of the hydrogel. Interestingly, HPMC-Si 2 Young’s modulus was found to be in the same range as that
for soft biological tissues (see the Supporting Information, Figure S14).27

The network mesh size (ξ), which monitors the physicochemical
properties of the hydrogel (rigidity, water displacement, etc.), was
calculated by rheological28 and swelling
studies,29 yielding values of 4.8 and 1.1
nm, respectively (Table 3).

Cryo-SEM analyses were also performed.
As shown in Figure 4, the network was homogeneous,
and the pore size was between 50 and 200 nm. When compared with the
mesh size calculated by rheology and swelling, cryo-SEM results displayed
a significant magnitude difference (Table 3).

Figure 4 Cryo-SEM images of the HPMC-Si 2 hydrogel (13.5 wt
%).

We assumed that the structure
observed in cryo-SEM analysis was
due to a macromolecular arrangement between HPMC chains, while cross-linking
between silanes (and then the mesh size) was at a nanometric scale,
nondetectable by this method. Thereby, we assumed that cells (up to
20 μm) could be entrapped in the hydrogel network but likely
could not proliferate.

One additional advantage of the sol–gel
process for bioink
design was the ease of further network covalent functionalization.
We already demonstrated that additional peptide ligands could be added
on PEG hydrogels to favor cell adhesion.19

As a proof of concept, we mixed triethoxysilyl fluorescein205 with HPMC-Si 2 to
prepare fluorescent hydrogels (HPMC-Si 2@5). As a control experiment, a hydrogel was prepared using the same
concentration (i.e., 1.7 mM) of fluorescein 6 but noncovalently entrapped
within the hydrogel network (HPMC-Si 2@6). The resulting hydrogels were then placed in phosphate buffer (10
mL), and the fluorescein release was monitored by HPLC. As expected,
almost no fluorescein release was observed on the hybrid fluorescein 5 that was covalently grafted on the network by Si–O–Si
bridges, even after 120 h (<1%). In contrast, all fluorescein from
material 6 was released after 48 h (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Multifunctional hybrid hydrogel: bioink and
fluorescein release
from hybrid hydrogels HPMC-Si 2@5 and HPMC-Si 2@6. Silylated fluorescein 5 (red
curve) and fluorescein 6 (blue curve) were added to HPMC-Si 2 solution from the start. All fluorescein 6 was
released after 48 h in PBS, while silylated fluorescein 5 remained in the hydrogel after 120 h.

Finally, a bioink containing hMSC (1.106 cells/mL), HPMC-Si 2 (13.5 wt %), and catalysts (condition C) in PBS was bioprinted.
It is noteworthy that at this concentration, the cells have not sedimented.
Briefly, the bioink was placed in a syringe and kept at 37 °C
for 160 min (i.e., according to the printing window) before writing
a 6-layer grid-patterned scaffold (Figure 6). As a control, the bioink was also casted
in a culture plate without going through the nozzle.

Figure 6 Grid-patterned scaffold
of the HPMC-Si 2 hydrogel
(13.5 wt %) containing cells. Resolution can be improved by printing
at a higher viscosity or at a lower pressure to extrude a thinner
filament.

Once printed, network reticulation
continues for 24 h at 37 °C.
The G′ increases from 0.16 kPa during printing
to 38 kPa after 24 h. The latest value was calculated from Young’s
modulus at 24 h: G′ = E/[2
× (1 + ν)]. To avoid drying of the hydrogel, PBS was added
in empty wells at the periphery of the culture plate, which contained
the cell-embedded hydrogels. The printing resolution was not optimal
but remained acceptable and comparable to other extruded scaffolds
obtained from photo-cross-linked hydrogels made with alginate or a
decellularized extracellular matrix with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG).30,31

After 24 h at 37 °C, the culture medium (αMEM with
10%
fetal calf serum, 100 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mM glutamine,
1 ng/mL basic fibroblast growth factor) was added to the cells. hMSCs
were cultured for 7 days with medium change after 3 days of culture.
At days 1 and 7, the viability of hMSC was evaluated using a live/dead
cell imaging kit (labeling for 15 min at room temperature) and confocal
microscopy.

One day after inclusion in the hydrogel, most of
the hMSCs were
alive, as indicated by the green color, and survived for at least
the follow-up 7 days (Figure 7A,C). It is worth noting that 3D printing did not alter hMSC
survival in the hydrogel since a majority of green living cells were
observed at day 1 and till day 7 (Figure 7B,D).

Figure 7 Viability of hMSCs in the HPMC-Si 2 hydrogel (13.5
wt %). hMSCs were labeled with live/dead staining at D1 (A, B) or
D7 (C, D) after pipetting (A, C) or 3D printing (B, D). Images show
the maximal projection of the z-axis, and scale bars
represent 100 μm.

Conclusions
This
study describes the first example of a cell-containing hydrogel
scaffold obtained by 3D bioprinting using the sol–gel process.
Beyond the example of HPMC, this strategy is generic enough to be
applied to any type of multisilylated biopolymer as a network precursor
polymerizable block. Advantageously, monosilylated organic molecules
such as peptide ligands, drugs, imaging probes, and cleavable linkers
could be added to the network precursors along with the cells to prepare
a wide range of different bioinks.
