We
analyzed the extracellular proteome of colistin-resistant Korean Acinetobacter baumannii (KAB) strains to identify
proteome profiles that can be used to characterize extensively drug-resistant
KAB strains. Four colistin-resistant KAB strains with colistin resistance
associated with point mutations in pmrB and pmrC genes were analyzed. Analysis of the extracellular
proteome of these strains revealed the presence of 506 induced common
proteins, which were hence considered as the core extracellular proteome.
Class C ADC-30 and class D OXA-23 β-lactamases were abundantly
induced in these strains. Porins (CarO and CarO-like porin), outer
membrane proteins (OmpH and BamABDE), transport protein (AdeK), receptor
(TonB), and several proteins of unknown function were among the specifically
induced proteins. Based on the sequence homology analysis of proteins
from the core proteome and those of other A. baumannii strains and pathogenic bacterial species as well as further in silico
screening, we propose that CarO-like porin is an A.
baumannii-specific protein and that two tryptic peptides
that originate from CarO-like porin detected by tandem mass spectrometry
are peptide makers of this protein.

Introduction
Acinetobacter
baumannii is one of
the most important opportunistic pathogens among ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus
aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, A. baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens.1 Currently, the majority
of A. baumannii strains that cause
nosocomial infections are multidrug resistant (MDR). Because of their
resistance, the bacteria easily colonize the respiratory tract, skin,
and wounds and cause pneumonia or sepsis.2 Therefore, infection with MDR A. baumannii threatens the survival of an immunocompromised patient in the intensive
care unit.3 Global isolation of colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains was recently reported. Frequent
outbreaks of these strains are a serious threat because colistin (polymyxin
E) is considered as a drug of last resort. Furthermore, most colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains have already acquired other
antibiotic resistance genes against useful antibiotics (β-lactams,
aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, etc.) and have become extensively
drug resistant (XDR).4,5

Consequently, -omics analyses
(genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomic
analyses) of MDR or XDR A. baumannii strains have been extensively performed to elucidate the resistance
mechanisms of these pathogens.6−9 Proteomic analysis of the membrane and cell wall
fraction of MDR A. baumannii DU202
revealed that stress associated with high concentrations of antibiotics
induces specific changes in the proteome. Specifically, imipenem exposure
notably increases the levels of various resistance-nodulation-division
transporters and penicillin-binding proteins (PonA) and decreases
the levels of outer membrane proteins (OmpW, OmpA, and CarO) to prevent
the import of antibiotics.6 Multi-omics
analysis of A. baumannii strain with
induced colistin resistance (ZJ06-200P5-1) revealed that loss of lipopolysaccharide
after mutation of the lpxC gene is the major cause
of the colistin resistance of this strain.7 Lipopolysaccharide loss also results in upregulation of resistance-related
protein sets.10 Genomic and proteomic analyses
of colistin-resistant XDR A. baumannii KAB03 revealed that β-lactamase class D blaoxa-23, β-lactamase class C ampC-20, AdeIJK, and PmrAB are the major
proteins of antibiotic resistance. Further, targeted mutagenesis demonstrated
that A138 and R263 of PmrB and R109 of PmrC are important residues for colistin resistance.4 The ultimate purpose of such studies is to characterize
the MDR or XDR pathogenic bacteria on the genomic or proteomic level
and to identify potential targets that might be useful for developing
new antibiotic drugs or diagnostic makers.11−13 In this context,
mining of specific protein(s) or proteome sets from clinically useful
XDR A. baumannii strains is important.

In the current study, we selected four colistin-resistant XDR Korean A. baumannii (KAB) strains and used proteomics to
analyze their extracellular fractions. We have specifically performed
proteomic analysis of secreted proteins (the extracellular protein
fraction) because this approach has several advantages for target
screening. The first advantage is the relatively low complexity of
the extracellular fraction. Therefore, the proteome sets can be relatively
easily characterized in search of useful targets. As a second advantage,
“real” proteomic information is obtained for the actual
secreted samples instead of an analysis involving theoretical bioinformatics
tools. In fact, multiple extracellular fractions or outer membrane
vesicles contain many cytosolic and membrane-related proteins, which
are theoretically irrelevant but have been experimentally identified.14−16 Finally, secretomic information can be used to predict candidate
proteins encountered by the host immune system upon bacterial infection.
We then used in silico analytical approaches (sequence homology analysis
and reverse vaccinology) to further characterize the identified proteome
sets. In conclusion, we propose that multi-omics approaches combined
with secretome analysis are a good tool for mining candidate protein
sets for diagnosing XDR A. baumannii strains.

Results and Discussion
Susceptibility Profiles of Colistin-Resistant
KAB Strains
We collected 36 carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) strains isolated from patients
from the intensive care units
of five hospitals in five cities of Korea in the years 2015–2016.
We selected four colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains from these 36 strains and designated them as A. baumannii KAB strains (KAB01, KAB03, KAB04, and
KAB08). A minimal inhibitory concentration test indicated that the
four strains were also resistant to β-lactams, cephalosporins,
carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones and were XDR (Table S1). Therefore, the four strains were colistin-resistant
CRAB. We also selected four colistin-sensitive CRAB strains (KAB02,
KAB05, KAB06, and KAB07) as reference strains for a comparative analysis.
All secreted CRAB strains showed variable resistance to tetracycline
and aminoglycosides.

Genomic Characterization of Colistin-Resistant
KAB Strains
Genome sequencing revealed that the genome size
of the four colistin-resistant
KAB strains ranged from 3.96 to 4.00 Mb, encoding 3919–4026
genes. All A. baumannii strains harbored
plasmids, with sizes ranging from 70.8 to 121.4 kb. Each plasmid contained
approximately 94–152 coding sequences. The data are summarized
in Table S2. Sequence types (STs) of the
colistin-resistant KAB strains were defined by using the multilocus
ST Oxford method. Multilocus ST analysis categorized the four colistin-resistant
KAB strains into three groups. KAB01 and KAB03 represented ST 451
(1-3-3-2-2-142-3); KAB04 represented ST 191 (1-3-3-2-2-94-3); and
KAB08 represented ST 208 (1-3-3-2-2-97-3). Antibiotic resistance genes
encoded by the KAB genomes were identified by using ResFinder 3.0.
A detailed list of antibiotic resistance genes and point-mutations
in the pmrBAC operon is presented in Table S3. In the current study, we used these
colistin-resistant KAB strains as sample strains to characterize the
secretome of colistin-resistant CRAB strains and to mine candidate
diagnostic protein sets.

Proteomic Analysis of the Extracellular Protein
Fraction of
Colistin-Resistant KAB Strains
We assumed that the secreted
or extracellular proteins are more useful targets for screening for
diagnostic marker proteins to identify XDR strains, including colistin-resistant
strains, than the soluble protein fraction. Because the colistin-resistant
KAB strains are XDR strains with respect to colistin, meropenem, and
amikacin, we cultured these strains in the presence of an antibiotic
mixture. We analyzed the extracellular fractions of the four colistin-resistant
KAB strains by one-dimensional (1D) liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and identified 665–768
proteins in each strain (Table S5-1). Although
the protein signature depends on the bacterial strain, we identified
506 common proteins that were present in the extracellular protein
fraction of the four colistin-resistant KAB strains (Figure 1A).

the extracellular proteome of four colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains. (A) Venn diagram of the data
for four colistin-resistant KAB strains (KAB01, 03, 04, and 08). (B)
COGs in the core proteome (506 proteins). Each protein was classified
by the definition of COG functional categories (A–V).27

Cluster of orthologous
group (COG) analysis of 506 core extracellular
proteins revealed that proteins belonging to post-translational modification,
protein turnover, and chaperone (O) groups and defense mechanism (V)
groups constituted a major portion of the extracellular proteins (Figure 1B). Representative
extracellular proteins are summarized according to the biological
function in Table S4. Two β-lactamases
amount to nearly 30% of the extracellular proteome, which are also
major proteins of defense mechanism (V) in the COG analysis. The secretion
of β-lactamase blaADC-30 by KAB strains was notable, and, amount-wise,
the protein comprised the highest proportion of the extracellular
fraction; blaOXA-23 was another major secreted β-lactamase,
but its abundance of protein was much smaller. We also detected various
outer membrane proteins (OmpW, OmpA, OmpH, OprD, and a putative porin)
in the extracellular fraction. Specifically, outer membrane proteins
encoded by the bam operon (BamABDE) were detected
in all KAB strains. One Bam protein, BamA, an outer membrane β-barrel
assembly protein, is highly immunogenic. It was suggested as a potential
vaccine against MDR A. baumannii because,
according to a previous study, BamA immunization results in 60% protection
from a lethal bacterial dose.28,29 In addition, among
the identified proteins, 95 proteins (approximately 18.7%) were identified
as pathogenic proteins (Table S5-2). We
also identified two porins (carbapenem susceptibility porin CarO and
CarO-like porin) among the secreted proteins. Other secreted proteins
of interest were lytic transglycosylases, which catalyze a nonhydrolytic
cleavage of peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. These proteins
are involved in the synthesis, remodeling, and degradation of the
cell wall. Because of their essential role in bacterial survival,
transglycosylases are considered to be potential drug targets.30 To further understand the proteomic differences
between strains in terms of their antibiotic resistance, we performed
a comparative analysis of colistin-resistant and colistin-sensitive
strains. The comparative analysis revealed that the extracellular
fractions of the colistin-resistant KAB strains (KAB01, KAB03, KAB04,
and KAB08) contained much more cytoplasmic proteins than those of
the colistin-sensitive strains (Figure S1). This suggested that various antibiotics (colistin, amikacin, and
meropenem) might facilitate the release of A. baumannii cytoplasmic proteins into the extracellular milieu. Heat map analysis
provided detailed data on the strain proteomes (Figure S1). We analyzed three nodes of the heat map (designated
as C1, C2, and C3) to characterize the signatures of the two KAB strain
groups. The major protein group categories in node C1 (proteins upregulated
in the colistin-resistant strains) were transport groups and metabolism
of amino acid and nucleotide (E and F) groups. By contrast, nodes
C2 and C3 (proteins upregulated in the colistin-sensitive strains)
were enriched for cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (M) proteins.

Screening of Specific A. baumannii Genes by Comparative Gene Analysis, in Silico Screening, and MS/MS
Analysis of Tryptic Peptides
The identified secreted proteins
potentially included vaccine or diagnostic markers. However, sequences
of many of these proteins were too similar to the same type of proteins
from other pathogenic Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria, preventing
their use as A. baumannii-specific
marker proteins. Examples include β-lactamases blaADC-30 and
blaOXA-23, which are frequently identified in K. pneumoniae strains and S. aureus, respectively.
Therefore, we used comparative gene homology analysis, in silico screening,
and MS/MS analysis in an attempt to select proteins specific for A. baumannii from among the core 506 proteins identified
by proteomics (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Selection procedure for candidate A. baumannii-specific proteins and tryptic peptides.

For the comparative analysis, we collated gene pools for 1048 strains
of six pathogenic bacteria [A. baumannii (123 strains), S. aureus (380 strains), K. pneumoniae (319 strains), Neisseria
meningitidis (94 strains), Streptococcus
pneumoniae (71 strains), and Haemophilus
influenzae (61 strains)] by downloading them from
the NCBI genome database. We performed the comparative analysis using
BLASTP with an e-value below 1e-20
as the cutoff. According to this criterion, we selected 132 proteins
that did not show significant sequence similarity with other pathogenic
bacteria as A. baumannii-specific (Figure 3 and Table S5-2).

Figure 3 Comparative genomic analysis of A. baumannii strains and other pathogenic bacteria.
Numbers in parenthesis indicate
the numbers of the genome database.

We next performed in silico screening by using antigenicity and
transmembrane helix indices to identify candidate proteins of high
antigenicity. We subsequently selected 73 proteins (Table S5-2). Finally, we applied the criterion of distinct
sequence count of over 5 in the MS/MS analysis to select putative
target proteins in real samples; this yielded 29 proteins (Tables 1 and S5-3). Because we performed the MS/MS analysis
on the tryptic peptide level, in a further analysis, we focused on
identifying accurate target peptides. From among tryptic peptides
of the selected 29 proteins, 18 were identified with a high frequency
of detection (more than 5 times) in all KAB strains. However, 16 peptides
were also identified in A. baumannii ATCC 19606 or did not have sufficient ion match values in the MS/MS
spectra. Finally, we selected two peptides (LVSSGSAVTTGDQSLEEAVNAEAR
and NWGVFGEVGAYY TGNPTVK) of a hypothetical protein (WP_000866524.1;
CarO-like porin) as the final putative target peptide (Figure 4 and Table S5-3).

Specific Induction of CarO-Like Porin in A. baumannii and Coculture Condition with A549 Cells
To confirm CarO-like
porin as a candidate diagnostic protein, we performed Western blotting
using secreted fractions and cell lysates of KAB strains. As a result,
the CarO-like porins were detected in secreted fractions and cell
lysates of all KAB strains but not detected in other pathogenic bacteria
(Figure 5A,B), suggesting
that CarO-like porin of KAB strains has unique antigenicity. Genome
analysis data revealed that A. baumannii ATCC 19606 has a homologous gene of 76% identity with CarO-like
porin. This explains the weak signal in A. baumannii ATCC 19606. Western blotting of cell lysate also showed that induction
of CarO-like porin in KAB strains was independent of antibiotic treatment
(meropenem) (Figure 5B). This result was consistent with previous proteomic analysis results.4 Finally, we performed coculture of A. baumannii KAB03 cells with A549 lung cells in
order to know whether CarO-like porin was secreted or not in this
culture condition.31,32 A positive signal was confirmed
after 4 h culture, and induction was increased according to the culture
time (Figure 5C).

Figure 5 CarO-like
porin secretion by A. baumannii KAB
strains and other pathogens. Polyclonal anti-CarO-like porin
antibody was used as the primary antibody (1:500; final concentration,
0.1 μg/μL) and anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody
(cell signaling, 1:1000). (A) CarO-like porins were detected in the
secreted fractions of A. baumannii cultured
in LB broth but not detected in other pathogenic bacteria. (B) CarO-like
porins were detected in the cell lysate of cultures under both conditions
of LB and LB with meropenem. (C) Positive signal was confirmed after
4 h of coculture of A. baumannii KAB03
cells with A549 lung cells.

Conclusions
In the current study, we prepared the extracellular
proteomes of
colistin-resistant KAB strains and identified the secreted proteins,
illustrating the types of proteins released by colistin-resistant
KAB strains into the extracellular milieu under antibiotic stress.
Cytosolic proteins constituted over 56.9% of all proteins of the extracellular
proteome. It is reasonable to expect that a cytosolic protein mixture
might have contaminated the extracellular proteome because of disruption
or aging of A. baumannii cells. Hence,
these proteins could not be fully removed from the extracellular proteome.
Nonetheless, these proteins are important because they are encountered
by the host immune system upon A. baumannii infection. Therefore, we used the secreted protein list as a basic
protein database for screening proteins specific to colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains, following the selection process
summarized in Figure 2. This approach yielded 29 candidate proteins, ultimately identifying
CarO-like porin as a candidate diagnostic protein marker with two
specific diagnostic peptide fragments. Further, we confirmed that
the candidate protein CarO-like porin was A. baumannii-specific and secreted into the culture medium when A549 cells were
cocultured with A. baumannii KAB03.
This suggests that CarO-like porin is a strong candidate diagnostic
protein marker. Originally, we used colistin-resistant KAB strains
to screen for specific markers of colistin-resistant strains. However,
CarO-like porin is included in the core genes (261 genes) of KAB strains,
regardless of the colistin resistance status of the strain (Figure S1D). Therefore, CarO-like porin can be
considered as one of the common CRAB markers, regardless of the colistin
resistance.

Experimental Procedures
Genomic DNA Preparation and Sequence Analysis
of Korean CRAB
Strains
Based on their multidrug–resistance profiles,
eight strains were selected for whole-genome sequencing from 36 A. baumannii strains isolated from pneumonia patients
at the intensive care units of five hospitals in five cities in Korea.
The isolates were designated KAB01–KAB03 (from Daejeon), KAB04
(from Busan), KAB05 and KAB06 (from Daegu), KAB07 (from Jeonju), and
KAB08 (from Gyeonggi). Genomic DNA of the KAB strains was extracted
using an MG genomic DNA purification kit (MG MED, Inc., Seoul, Korea).
The extracted DNA was used for the construction of SMRTbell libraries.
Whole-genome sequencing was performed using the PacBio RS II platform
(Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Raw sequence reads were assembled
using PacBio SMRT Analysis (v2.3.0) with the default option of the
Hierarchical Genome Assembly Process 3.

Gene Annotation and Bioinformatics
Prokka software
and RAST server were used for genome annotation of the reconstructed
KAB genomes.17,18 STs of A. baumannii KAB strains were determined by using a previously described method.4 Antibiotic resistant genes were identified by
using ResFinder 3.0.19 Pathogenic proteins
were identified by using PathogenFinder 1.1.20 In silico screening of putative antigen proteins was based on three
predictions: (i) the number of transmembrane helices; (ii) similarity
to host proteins (predictions i and ii were made by using Vaxign);21 and (iii) antigenicity score (calculated by
using VaxiJen v2.0).22 A proteome database
was constructed by using CD-HIT (sequence identity cutoff, 0.9) from
38,779 protein sequences of 10 A. baumannii strains, including KAB01–KAB08.23 The constructed database contains 4988 homologous protein sequences.
The protein database was then used for MS/MS proteomic analysis.

Antimicrobial Susceptibility Assay
The antimicrobial
susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates
was tested using the Vitek 2 system, as previously described.24 The susceptibility of A. baumannii isolates was determined by the agar dilution method, in accordance
with the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute
(CLSI document m100-s25).

Preparation of Extracellular Protein Fraction
A. baumannii KAB strains and A. baumannii ATCC 19606 were cultured under three
culture conditions: (i) strain
ATCC 19606 was cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) broth; (ii) strains
KAB02, KAB05, KAB06, and KAB07 were cultured in LB broth supplemented
with meropenem (16 μg/mL); (iii) strains KAB01, KA03, KAB04,
and KAB08 were cultured in LB broth supplemented with meropenem (16
μg/mL), amikacin (16 μg/mL), and colistin (2 μg/mL).
The cells were harvested at OD600 = 0.7–0.8. The
cultured media were then filtered through a 0.45 mm membrane filter
and precipitated in 90% ammonium sulfate solution. The supernatant
was centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min, and the pellets
were suspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The protein solution was
extensively dialyzed against 10 volumes of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)
using dialysis tubing with a molecular mass cutoff of 10,000 Da. The
protein concentration was calculated by using the bicinchoninic acid
method. Proteins were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) before protein identification.

In-Gel
Digestion and Proteomic Analysis Using LC–MS/MS
Silver-stained
gels were destained in a solution of 30 mM potassium
ferricyanide and 100 mM sodium thiosulfate. The gels were then rinsed
several times with distilled water to stop the destaining reaction.
For Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining, the gels were destained in
a destaining solution (50% acetonitrile and 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate).25 The destained gels were rinsed with distilled
water, followed by a rinse in 100% acetonitrile. After drying using
a speed vacuum concentrator, the gels were incubated in a solution
of 10 mM dithiothreitol and 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate at 56 °C,
followed by incubation in 100 nM iodoacetamide to reduce and alkylate
S–S bridges. The gels were then washed with two or three volumes
of distilled water by vortex-mixing and completely dried using a speed
vacuum concentrator. Tryptic digestion was performed in 50 mM ammonium
bicarbonate at 37 °C for 12–16 h. For optimal digestion,
the final trypsin concentration was adjusted to 10 ng/mL. Tryptic
peptides were obtained by two extraction steps in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate
and 50% acetonitrile containing 5% trifluoroacetic acid. The resulting
peptide extracts were pooled and lyophilized in a vacuum concentrator
and stored at 4 °C. Tryptic peptides were suspended in 0.5% trifluoroacetic
acid prior to further analysis. A 10 μL tryptic peptide sample
was loaded onto an MGU30-C18 trapping column (LC Packings) to enrich
peptides and remove chemical contaminants. Concentrated tryptic peptide
solutions were eluted from the column and directed onto a 10 cm ×
75 μm I.D. C18 reverse-phase column (PROXEON, Odense, Denmark)
at a flow rate of 300 nL/min. Peptides were eluted by a gradient of
0–65% acetonitrile for 80 min. All MS and MS/MS spectra were
acquired in a data-dependent mode using an LTQ-Velos ESI ion trap
mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). After each full
MS scan (m/z range, 400–2000), three MS/MS
scans of the most abundant precursor ions in the MS spectra were performed.
The MS/MS data were analyzed by using MASCOT 2.4, with a cutoff value
corresponding to a false discovery rate of 1%. Protein quantities
were calculated by using the exponentially modified protein abundance
index and are denoted as mol %. For each sample, three technical replicates
were performed, and the proteins identified at least two times in
each triplet were used for further analysis. The mass spectrometry
data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange consortium via the
PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier: PXD015959.

Coculture of A549 Cells with A. baumannii KAB03 and Preparation of Secreted Proteins
A549 cells purchased
from ATCC were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Hyclone) supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum containing penicillin (100 U/mL) and streptomycin
(100 μg/mL) at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A. baumannii KAB03 cells were cultured in LB medium
containing 4 μg/mL colistin at 37 °C. A549 cells were seeded
into a 100 mm culture dish at a density of 6.3 × 106/mL; approximately 4 × 106/mL of KAB03 was added
to the dish. The cells in the culture dishes were incubated for 2,
4, or 6 h in RPMI-1640 serum-free medium at 37 °C and 5% CO2. A549 cells and A. baumannii KAB03 cells were separated from the culture medium by centrifugation
at 5000g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the
secreted proteins was saturated with 80% ammonium sulfate at 4 °C
for 2 h and then precipitated at 150,000g for 1 h.
Ammonium sulfate was then removed from the precipitated protein samples
by dialysis (vivaspin 5000 MWCO; Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany)
by using over 10 volumes of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0).

Western Blotting
Western blotting was performed as
previously described.26 Briefly, about
30 μg of secreted proteins was separated by 12% SDS-PAGE. Polyclonal
anti-CarO-like porin antibody was used as the primary antibody (1:500;
final concentration, 0.1 μg/μL). After incubating with
the anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (cell signaling, 1:1000), the
blots were visualized using the Bio-Rad ChemiDoc system.
