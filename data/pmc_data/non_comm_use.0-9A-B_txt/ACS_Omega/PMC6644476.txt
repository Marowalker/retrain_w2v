This
paper describes lithium–tin alloys as a novel target
material to enhance the efficiency of 13.5 nm extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) light from generated laser-produced plasmas. Both lithium and
tin exhibit EUV emission with the same peak at 13.5 nm. We show that
lithium–tin (LiSn) alloys exhibit emission also at 13.5 nm
and a mixture of tin and lithium emission by illuminating Nd:YAG laser
(1 ns, 2.5 × 1010, 7.1 × 1010 W/cm2). The emission spectra and emission angular distribution
by using phosphor imaging plates were analyzed to obtain the conversion
efficiency from laser light to 13.5 nm light. The Li–Sn alloys
were slightly higher than planar tin and between tin and lithium.
It would be due to the suppression of self-absorption of 13.5 nm light
by the tin plasma.

Introduction
Extreme ultraviolet
(EUV) is a promising shorter wavelength light
source than the ArF laser (193 nm) in the present semiconductor-integrated
circuit manufacturing industry. EUV lithography is at the stage of
test for mass production manufacturing a feature size of sub-10 nm.1,2 The light source of 13.5 nm is one of the critical issues for practical
EUV lithography. The most promising EUV source is based on laser-produced
plasmas (LPPs) from tin droplets with double pulse laser illumination.3,4 The target choice of tin,3−29 especially low-density tin,19−29 is due to the highest conversion efficiency (CE) from laser light
to EUV.3−5 This is attributed to the unresolved transition array
(UTA) arising from Sn8+ to Sn21+ 4d–4f
transitions.6 The double pulse scheme controls
the plasma density to be 10–18 atom/cm3 and reduces the amount of debris. According to the theoretical study,5 the target is expanded to form quasi-steady state
within 100 ps, and laser is absorbed almost 100% at the Sn ion density
of 1010/cm3, which is 10 mm from the solid tin
surface.

On the other hand, lithium LPPs have a simple line
emission and
an intense line at 13.5 nm that is based on the 1s–2p Lyman
a transition in excited Li2+ ions, where the electron temperature
is 15–18 eV.30−36 The ionization energy of the lithium ion is much smaller than that
of tin. This means that the absorption energy is much less wasted
in the lithium LPP compared to Sn LPPs. To increase the lower CE of
Li LPP, a forced recombination method was invented,30−36 where Li3+ ions were cooled by low-temperature electrons from a reflector and converted
to excited Li+ ions. In view of the CE depending on different
LPP temperatures for Sn and Li, a combination of Sn and Li might serve
as an efficient target, that is, Sn should be heated by a laser and
Li is heated by the remnant thermal energy of the Sn ions. The hybrid
material of tin/lithium is interesting; however, lithium is air- and
moisture-sensitive to serve as a laser target.37 In this study, we introduce an electrochemically synthesized
alloy target and EUV generation from it. The search for such materials
is still important for a laboratory-scale and compact EUV source (10–100
Hz), because the present source for lithography becomes huge (>200
W, 100 kHz) and expensive for the laboratory use. For fundamental
research, a compact EUV source is still required by combining the
relatively small laser and new efficient target materials.

Tin/lithium
alloys have been investigated in the field of lithium-ion
battery anodes. Tin is of interest as a lithium-ion battery anode
material because of its high theoretical specific capacity (993 mA
h/g for Li22Sn5), nontoxicity, and low cost,
as with other group 14 elements.38,39 The alloying
and dealloying of tin with lithium is possible with the electrochemical
technique using thin-film tin electrodes. The composition of the tin/lithium
alloy is controlled by the potential of the cell using tin and lithium
as the electrode materials.

This paper demonstrates the character
of a lithium–tin alloy
for generation of EUV at 13.5 nm. Two different alloys were prepared
and examined from their EUV spectra and phosphor-imaging plate (IP)
data to obtain the CE values.

Experimental Section
The Sn thin
films were prepared on Cu foil (Nilaco Corp.) substrates
by pulsed laser deposition using fourth harmonics of Nd:YAG laser
(Quanta-Ray Lab-150-10, Spectra-Physics), where the substrate was
kept at room temperature under vacuum condition of 10–4 Pa. The thickness of the Sn films is 2 μm. The stainless-steel
electrochemical cell was used for alloying of the Sn with Li. The
electrochemical cell was prepared using a Li metal foil as a counter
electrode and 1 mol/L LiPF6 solution in 1:1 volume ratio
of ethylene carbonate and dimethyl carbonate as the electrolyte. The
electrochemical cell was cycled two times by constant current discharge/charge
(current density: 67 μA/cm2) using a potentiostat/galvanostat
(VMP3, Bio-Logic). The potential range is between 0.8 and 0.2 V versus
Li/Li+. After constant current measurement, the potential
was kept for 2.0 V to obtain the Li0.2Sn alloy (Li–Sn
43) and kept for 0.4 V to obtain the Li2.5Sn alloy (Li–Sn
44).

EUV generation was performed using the same instrumentation
setup
as shown in Figure 1. We used an Nd:YAG laser with 1 ns pulse duration, 2 mJ pulse power
(Hamamatsu L11038-01), and a spot size of either 100 or 60 μm,
full width half-maximum, to give an intensity of 2.5 × 1010 or 7.1 × 1010 W/cm2. BAS-TR (Fujifilm,
Japan) IPs fitted with a 100 nm thick Zr filter (NTT, Japan) were
used to obtain EUV angular distribution data (20°–90°).
The Li–Sn targets and reference metals [Li (Kanto Chemical
Co.), Japan] and [Sn (Nilaco, Japan)] were ablated as planar materials.
Furthermore, all EUV spectra were obtained using a charged couple
device set at 45° with respect to the target. An energy calorimeter
(Nova II, Ophir) was used to obtain the emission energy, and was set
at 45° with respect to target normal and 270 mm distance. Igor
Pro software was used for EUV spectra and data analysis.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram
of the experimental setup to obtain EUV and IP
data. A load-lock system was used to insert targets/IPs into the chamber
under vacuum conditions. This allowed for quick insertion and removal
of the IPs. The distance from the target to the IP was equidistant
at all observed angles. The GIS and entrance aperture were 45°
with respect to the target.

Results
The pulse laser deposition of tin on copper was
successfully done,
and the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern of the Sn film on the Cu substrate
is shown in Figure S1, indicating that
crystalline Sn is confirmed without any impurities.

Figure 2 shows the
constant current discharge/charge voltage profile of Sn film plotted
as a function of time. The discharge process from 0 to 1.7 h corresponds
the alloying process of Li–Sn. The alloying process of Sn with
Li occurs in the plateau region below 0.7 V. In the voltage between
1.5 and 1.2 V, there is a decomposition reaction of the electrolyte
due to the catalytic action of Sn. While the charge process from 1.7
to 1.9 h corresponds to the dealloying of Li–Sn. Reversible
reaction of Li–Sn alloying/dealloying is confirmed. After the
constant current cycles, the voltage is kept at the each voltage to
obtain the different Li–Sn alloy composition.

The EUV emission spectra of reference
Sn, reference Li, and Li–Sn
alloys can be seen in Figures 3–6, and the 2% band ratios at 13.5 nm per 10–20 nm emission
are shown in Table 1.

The tin EUV emission spectrum is
identical to the previously characterized
as an UTA consisting of a strong peak at around 13.5 nm arising from
Sn8+ to Sn21+ 4d–4f transitions5 for Nd:YAG lasers with intensities in the region
of 1010 W/cm.26 The EUV spectrum
from the lithium plasma has been characterized as line emission arising
from Li2+ 1s–2p (13.5 nm), Li2+ 1s–3p
(11.35 nm), and Li1+ 1s2–4p (17.5 nm).30 The remaining lines can be attributed to surface
impurities, consisting of carbon and oxygen, during sample preparation.
All of the Li–Sn EUV emission spectra can be described in the
following two manners for both the first and second shots (Table 2); tin-like (Sn-like)
emission or lithium-like (Li-like) emission, where the appearance
of the EUV emission spectrum was more characteristic of one of the
reference metals. Sn-like emission was characterized by a broad UTA
around 13.5 nm, and a Li-like emission was represented by line emissions
at 11.35 and 13.5 nm. For the first shot, emission from Li–Sn
44 contains more Sn contribution than Li–Sn 43. For the second
shot, both of the alloys exhibited stronger emission than those of
the first shot, and only a small difference between the two alloys.

The IP response for 10–20
nm EUV was detected after passing
through Zr filter. The angular distribution of emission is informative
for the absorption (opacity) effect by the plume plasma. Equation 1 is a conventional phenomenal
analysis of the angular distribution.7,8 1  where I(θ) is the intensity
at θ degree.

The angular distribution is required to obtain
CE from laser energy
as estimated by eq 2. 2  where E(45), I(45),
and LE, are energy at 45°, IP signal at 45°, and
irradiated laser energy, respectively. The E(45)
value was registered by the calorimeter to be 4.0 × 10–5 J/sr, according to the same condition as the previous research for
tin targets,40 where the ratio of inband
(10–20 nm) per out band (longer than 20 nm) emission was 1:1.8.10

The CE values for the reference metals
were 1.35 and 0.04% for
Sn and Li, respectively, for the second shots. For the alloys, the
CEs were 1.36 and 1.45% for Li–Sn 43 and Li–Sn 44, respectively,
for the second shots. For all of the materials, the first shot exhibited
a smaller CE than the second shot, mainly because of the surface contamination.

We measured 2.8 times focused laser illumination (7.1 × 1010 W/cm2) as shown in Figures S2 and S3, by the use of the same laser and just changing the
focus spot. The EUV intensity at 13.5 nm was slightly higher than
the case described above, meaning that the present laser intensity
is almost optimum to obtain the highest CE. In the case of smaller
laser spot size, the error range becomes higher than that for larger
spot size and more difficult to control target position.

Discussion
Before we discuss the material-dependent EUV emission, we will
summarize the first and the second shots. In the previous study for
Sn, the difference was observed mainly for the first and later shots,
the third and fourth shots gave almost the same data as the second,40 and then, we focus on the second shots in the
present study. As for the alloy sample, the thickness is only 2 μm,
and the third shot will reach to the Cu substrate. All of the first
shots exhibited weaker emission than those of the second shot and
include emissions at 12.9 and 17.3 nm, which are due to O5+ (2p–4d) and (2p–3d), respectively. The existence of
O atoms means the contamination on the surface by mainly oxidation
of the metal and adsorbed water. In the case of the alloy, the contribution
of tin was smaller than those of the second shot. It may consist of
oxygen impurity is mainly due to lithium oxidation. For the angular
distribution shown in Figure 7 and Table 1, we can indicate that the first shots tend to lower uniformity,
while the detailed discussion would be complicated because of the
surface contamination.

Figure 7 IP data of Sn, Li, and Li–Sn alloys. The data consist
of
a photoluminescence image (red) and corresponding fitted data (blue)
for the first (left) and second (right) shots for each material.

It was expected that a eutectic
alloy would show emission properties
from both atoms of tin and lithium. Actually, the alloys exhibited
emission spectrum of both tin and lithium. The angular distribution
parameter of x value in cosx θ is also between tin and lithium. However, the CE value
of the alloy is not middle and slightly higher than that of tin. When
we compare the peak of the spectrum at 13.5 nm, the alloy exhibited
a sharper peak than that of tin. Such a narrow and relatively monochromatic
Sn emission is typically observed for low-density tin targets. The
slightly higher CE value could be due to both line emission from lithium
and low-density tin effects.

The content of lithium and tin
in each alloy would have an effect
on the CE (the CE of both Li–Sn alloys: 1.68 and 1.79%). It
is interesting that the difference is small in comparison to the one-order
difference of lithium content to be Li0.2Sn and Li2.5Sn for Li–Sn 43 and Li–Sn 44, respectively.
According to the in situ XRD study of tin electrodes for lithium ion
batteries, Li0.2Sn has two phases of Sn and Li2Sn5 and Li2.5Sn has two phases of β-LiSn
and Li22Sn5. These alloys, Li2Sn5, β-LiSn, and Li22Sn5 phases,
that form as the white tin is lithiated have additional volume ratios
of 19, 50, and 280%.30 From these values,
the volume percentages for lithium can be estimated to be 9.5 and
179% per Sn for Li0.2Sn and Li2.5Sn, respectively.
The theoretical study showed the optimized tin density for highest
CE is 10–3 order to the solid tin density.3−5 The present two eutectic alloys have >10–1 density,
and then, the difference would not so large apparently, while a slight
increase in Li–Sn 44 was observed as lower tin density. In
the chemical synthesis, the ratio of Li2.5Sn is considerably
large, and the present electrochemical method is useful to obtain
a compound with such a ratio as theoretically high specific capacity.38,39 Actually, the previous synthesis based on the porous tin template
technique did not show EUV emission,37 may
be due to 100 nm scale heterogeneous mixture, not compound. Then,
the present electrochemical synthesis is the first example to exhibit
enhancement to combine lithium and tin.

The IP data of the alloys
provided an insight into the optical
thickness of the generated tin plasmas, because tin plasma shows more
re-absorption effect than lithium.41,42 Both Li–Sn
alloy IP data were fit with a cosx θ
value, were x = 0.36 and 0.46, which are more than
that for tin (0.62), implying the suppression of absorption by tin
plasma.

Recent photochemistry shows surface-selective carbon
oxidation
by the use of 13.5 nm light,43 and the
photoresist material is still under investigation.44 The present target would be a candidate as a compact light
source with 10–100 Hz laser for 13.5 nm by combining a conventional
millijoule-class laser.

Conclusions
In this paper, we showed
that an EUV light generation from LPP
for electrochemically synthesized Li–Sn alloy. It was enhanced
EUV light rather than pure Sn, not between of tin and lithium, while
the spectra were of those from tin and lithium. The eutectic Li–Sn
alloy had an angular distribution between that of tin and lithium,
which was indicated by the high-space-resolution IP data. The CE enhancement
could be a result of the alloy structure, with Li atoms mixed with
Sn to reduce the opacity of the plasma.
