Chiral-at-metal compounds (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 and (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6 were prepared using
anions 1O-2N– and 2O-1N– of the
Schiff bases, derived from the hydroxynaphthaldehydes and (S)-1-phenylethylamine. The pure (RRu,SC)-diastereomers were obtained
by crystallization. In the unit cell of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6, there are three independent molecules, which differ in the
propeller sense of the PPh3 ligand. Molecules [1] and [2]
have (MPPh3)-configuration
and molecule [3] has (PPPh3)-PPh3 configuration. PPh3 diastereoisomerism
is discussed including other pairs of compounds, differing only in
the PPh3 configuration. A conformational analysis reveals
an internal stabilization inside the PPh3 ligand by a system
of attractive CH/π interactions and a new bonding motif PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar, both characteristic features
of [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] compounds. The propeller
diastereomers interconvert via a low-energy pathway and a high-energy
pathway, corroborated by density functional theory calculations.

Introduction
In
half-sandwich compounds of type [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3], π-Ar = η6-C6H6, η5-C5H5, the triphenylphosphine
ligand accounts for about half of the molecule. Figure 1 shows a hypothetical staggered conformation A in a Newman projection looking along P-M, which differentiates
the phenyl rings into gauche and trans with respect to π-Ar.
In such a conformation, the inner ortho-hydrogen
atoms of the phenyl rings would approximate each other to unacceptably
short distances. The phenyl rings avoid this steric hindrance by rotation
around their P–Cipso bonds, adopting a propeller
structure B in Figure 1. When steric hindrance disappears, weak attractive
forces such as CH/π interactions in the internal PPh3 stabilization (see below) come into play.

[(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] looking
along P-M. Hypothetical staggered conformation (A). Propeller conformation

In a 1983 paper, we showed that
in half-sandwich compounds [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] there is an additional rotation about the P-M bond, differentiating
the gauche phenyl rings into close and distant to π-Ar (C in Figure 1).1 The phenyls close to π-Ar have
rotation angles |0 < ρ < 60°|, and the phenyls distant
to π-Ar have |60 < ρ < 120°|. Subsequently,
we will show that this rotation is part of bonding motif PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar.

In the present paper, we
describe the synthesis and characterization
of compounds (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 (Cy = cymene,
1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene, 1O-2N– = (S)-2-[[(1-phenylethyl)imino]methyl]-1-naphthalenolate) and (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6 (2O-1N– = (S)-1-[[(1-phenylethyl)imino]methyl]-2-naphthalenolate). In the crystal,
chiral-at-metal compound (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 forms diastereomers, which differ only in the configuration of the
triphenylphosphine propeller. In this context, we discuss eight pairs
of such propeller diastereomers, develop the PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar bonding concept, and reveal low- and high-energy
pathways of the interconversion of the PPh3 propeller.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis and X-ray Characterization
Diastereomerically
pure compounds (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 and (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6 (Scheme 1) were obtained in the following sequence of reactions.
Deprotonated ligands 1OH-2N and 2OH-1N2 were reacted with [CyRuCl]2Cl2 to give (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)Cl]
and (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)Cl], respectively. Treatment with PPh3 and
NH4PF6 afforded products (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 and (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6. In both cases, the pure (RRu,SC) diastereomers were obtained by crystallization
from CH2Cl2 as red crystals suitable for X-ray
analysis (Table S1 in the Supporting Information).
In the unit cell of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6, there are
two different molecules [1] and [2] with the (M,M,M)-configuration of the PPh3 ligand and one molecule [3] with the (P,P,P)-PPh3 configuration.

Scheme 1 (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6, 1O-2N– = (S)-2-[[(1-phenylethyl)imino]methyl]-1-naphthalenolate, and (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6, 2O-1N– = (S)-1-[[(1-phenylethyl)imino]methyl]-2-naphthalenolate

The molecular structures will be discussed
first for (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6 and then for
the diastereomers of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6. The π-stack
between the substituted
phenyl ring of the naphthyl system and one of the phenyl rings of
the PPh3 ligand is a striking feature in the structure
of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6 (Figure 2, left side). The distance between the carbon
atoms [(Np)C2-Ci(Ph) = 3.21 Å] is considerably shorter
than the distance between the layers in graphite (3.35 Å). The
distances (Np)C2-Co(Ph) and (Np)C1-Co(Ph) are
3.27 and 3.16 Å.

atoms omitted for clarity.

Two independent molecules [1] and [2] of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 with the same propeller sense show similar
π-stacks
with corresponding distances, e.g., (Np)C1-Ci(Ph) = 3.20
and 3.21 Å. On the other hand, there is no such π-stack
in the third independent molecule [3] of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6, having the opposite PPh3 propeller configuration
(Figure 2, right side).

Internal CH/π Stabilization within the PPh3 Propeller
The architecture of the PPh3 propeller
is determined by CH/π interactions of the type found in the
archetypal T-shaped benzene dimer.5−9 Contrary to those in the T-shaped benzene dimer, the CH/π
interactions in PPh3 are intramolecular and thus entropically
almost neutral. In the PPh3 ligand, there are six Co-H bonds, three inside the propeller (inCoH) and three outside (outCoH). It is the interaction
between the inCo-H bonds and Ci, inCo, and outCo atoms of neighboring
phenyl rings (i/o/p = ipso/ortho/para) that adds up to an appreciable
stabilization, as discussed in refs (10) and (11) (Figure 3).

Figure 3 CH/π interactions Ph3 → Ph1, Ph2 → Ph3, and
Ph1 → Ph2 looking along the P-M axis.

In the following discussion, the torsion angles |Co-Ci-P-M|< 90° of phenyls Ph1, Ph2, and Ph3 will
be called
propeller angles τ. Table 1 contains these τ angles and distances CoH-Ci and CoH-Co of the CH/π
interactions inside the PPh3 propeller. As in our former
analyses,10,11 we ordered the propeller angles according
to the smallest angle in the phenyl ring called Ph1. In addition to
the four new molecules of the present paper, we added the pair of
diastereomers of (RRu,SC)-[(π-C6H6)Ru(O-N)PPh3]PF6, O-N = anion of the Schiff base derived from
salicylaldehyde and (S)-1-phenylethylamine, for which
both diastereomers HEDYIY and HEDYOE differ only in the PPh3 propeller sense.12 (RRu,SC)-[(π-C6H6)Ru(O-N)PPh3]PF6 is the parent
benzene/phenyl compound of the cymene/naphthyl compounds of the present
paper.

Each of the three phenyls plays a specific role in
interactions
Ph3 → Ph1 = inCoH(3) → Ci/o(1), Ph2 → Ph3 = inCoH(2) → Ci/o(3), and Ph1 → Ph2 = inCoH(1)
→ Ci/o(2), represented by the arrows in Figure 3. The differentiation
into dashed and bold inCoH → Co interactions is relevant.10,11 All of the 18 inCoH-Ci distances are appreciably below
3.0 Å, the sum of the van der Waals radii of the hydrogen atom
and the sp2-hybridized carbon atom,10,11,13 and thus within the bonding range of CH/π
interactions. The same is true for 15 of the 18 inCoH-Co distances (Table 1). The approximation of the ortho-CH bonds to the ipso- and ortho-carbon atoms of neighboring phenyl rings to distances far below
the sum of the van der Waals radii shows the internal stabilization
in the PPh3 ligands. The Ph1 propeller angles in Table 1 span a broad range
from |6.4°| to |25.2°|. For all of these τ(Ph1) angles,
phenyls Ph2 and Ph3 find propeller angles to establish the necessary
CH/π interactions for the internal stabilization.10,11

Propeller Chirality
Each of the three M-P-Ph systems
in a PPh3 ligand is an independent element of chirality.10,11 The propeller angles Co-Ci-P-M < 90°
are measures of the chirality of the M-P-Ph entities. They define
(P)/(M) chirality of the M-P-Ph
blades of the PPh3 propeller according to the helicity
rule of the CIP system.14 Negative propeller
angles correspond to (P) chirality, and positive
propeller angles correspond to (M) chirality.

In (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6, the propeller angles
Co-Ci-P-M < 90° in the PPh3 ligand are +25.6, +86.2, and +44.3° (Table 1). As all torsion angles are positive, the
(M,M,M)-configuration
has to be assigned to the PPh3 ligand. In (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6, the unit cell contains three independent
molecules. Two of them, [1] and [2], have (M,M,M)-configuration due to positive torsion
angles +14.2, +82.6, and +44.0° and +6.4, +89.5 (−88.0),
and +44.7°. In the phenyl ring, with the highest torsion angle
of the (M,M,M)-diastereomers
of 2O-1N and 1O-2N, the two ortho positions are almost equivalent
(large thermal ellipsoids). Use of one or the other will interchange
the symbols (M) and (P). The torsion
angles of [1] and [2] are very similar to those of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6. However, the third molecule [3] in the unit
cell of (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 is very different. Its
PPh3 ligand has (P,P,P)-configuration due to its negative torsion angles −25.2,
−61.9, and −69.5° (Table 1).

Our recent analysis of 119 compounds
of type [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] had shown that propeller
configurations can be divided into
two subgroups (P,P,P)/(M,M,M) (∼90%
abundance) and (M,P,P)/(P,M,M) (∼10%
abundance).10,11 As all of the new cymene/naphthyl
compounds and their parent benzene/phenyl compounds HEDYOE and HEDYIY
belong to the (P,P,P) or (M,M,M) type,
we will subsequently use symbols (PPPh3) and (MPPh3) for the
propeller configuration of the PPh3 ligand.

Rotation Angles
ρ
In ref (1), we demonstrated that 11
[(π-Ar)LLMPPh3] compounds and 17 [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] compounds
adopted structures of type C, in Figure 1, with rotation angles far below 60°.
This rotation brings the gauche phenyl |0 < ρ < 60°|
close and face-on toward π-Ar, whereas the gauche phenyl |60
< ρ < 120°| becomes distant and edge-on toward π-Ar.
It was argued that the steric hindrance of the π-Ar ligand with
the ortho-CH bond of the edge-exposed phenyl is responsible
for the rotation,1 which is wrong (see
below).

Figure 4 shows Newman projections of the six salicylaldiminato compounds.
They clearly subdivide into two types, which have surprisingly similar
conformations, irrespective of their π-Ar and O-N substituents.
In all of the compounds, Ph3 is face-exposed to π-Ar with rotation
angles ρ below |60°|, whereas Ph1 is edge-exposed with
rotation angles ρ above |60°|. Taking into account the
+/– signs of the rotation angles, the entire configurational
symbols are (RRu,SC,MPPh3) for the compounds
on the left and (RRu,SC,PPPh3) for those
on the right of Figure 4. The rotation angles of Phface concentrate in the narrow
range from |28.7°| to |47.0°|. With |89.2°| to |76.7°|,
the rotation angles, ρ, of Phedge add up to 120°
(Table S2 in the Supporting Information).
The average of rotation angles ρ(Phface) is |40.0°|.

and HEDYOE looking along P-M.

In Table S2, we included another
five
pairs of diastereomers, which differ only in the propeller sense of
the PPh3 ligand: VOWTUW,15 GIRYIP,16 ZINXOJ,17 FOMZEN,18 and RCMXFE.19 These
compounds are of types [CpFe(CO)(R)PPh3] and [CpRe(NO)(R)PPh3]X. In the unit cell of these compounds, there are two independent
molecules with the same metal configuration and opposite PPh3 configurations. This is similar to the four cymene/naphthyl compounds
of the present paper, although they have an additional chiral center
in the chelate ligand. For diastereomers HEDYIY and HEDYOE of (RRu,SC)-[(π-C6H6)Ru(O-N)PPh3]PF6, however,
the situation is different. We could isolate the diastereomers of
this compound as separate single crystals.12 Thus, HEDYOE and HEDYIY are two different modifications of (RRu,SC)-[(π-C6H6)Ru(O-N)PPh3]PF6. We also
included SEPZUI in Table S2. Its two diastereomers
differ in the metal configuration, having the same PPh3 propeller sense (PPPh3).20

The rotation angles of Phface and Phedge of
the CpFe(CO) and CpRe(NO) compounds hook up with the salicyliminato
compounds, except for (MPPh3) diastereomer GIRYIP[1], which is not used for average calculations
(Table S2). The overall average of rotation
angles ρ(Phface) is −36.8° for the (PPPh3) diastereomers and 40.0°
for the (MPPh3) diastereomers.
The face-on approximation of Phface to π-Ar is an
indication of a bonding attraction, considered next.

Bonding Motif
PhPPh3 Face-On π-Ar
The bonding
system PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar
includes elements of the T-shape as well as of the π-stack benzene
dimer, and it contains the Ru and the P atom. In addition to rotation
angles ρ, angle φ between the planes of π-Ar and
Phface is a measure of the π-Ar/Phface interaction. Figure 5 shows the arrangement of π-Ar and PhPPh3 in HEDYIY (φ = 27.6°, left side) and HEDYOE (φ
=28.6°, right side). In HEDYIY, distances CAr-Ci 3.32 Å and CAr-Co 3.30 Å
are below the graphite distance of 3.35 Å, indicating a π-stack
interaction. T-shape benzene dimer interactions show up in distances
such as (π-Ar)CH-Co = 2.76 Å and (π-Ar)CH-Ci = 2.91 Å. The corresponding distances of propeller diastereomer
HEDYOE are similar. In HEDYIY and HEDYOE, rotation angles ρ
= 37.3 and −28.7° of the face-on phenyls enforce rotation
angles of ρ = −82.4 and 89.2° for the corresponding
edge-on phenyls.

Figure 5 Bonding system PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar
in HEDYIY, HEDYOE, and PIGJOG.

In Figure 6, rotation
angles ρ of the face-on and edge-on phenyls of the 18 diastereomers,
differing only in the propeller configuration of the PPh3 ligand, are shown as a function of π-Ar/Phface angles
φ. They crowd around the averages of ρ and φ, which
are ρav= −34.3° and φav = 23.6° for the (PPPh3) diastereomers and ρav = 40.0° and φav = 24.2° for the (MPPh3) diastereomers. The averages of ρ and φ of the
edge-on phenyls are ρav = −81.0°/φav = 55.3° for the (PPPh3) diastereomers and ρav = 81.8°/φav = 46.1° for the (MPPh3) diastereomers.

π-Ar. Bottom: Pathways a and b for diastereomer interconversion.

The turning of PhPPh3 face-on to π-Ar
is a general phenomenon. In the histogram of Figure 7, this is shown for 140 cases of 119 compounds
of type [(π-C6R6)RuLL′PPh3], obtained in a CSD search for [(π-C6R6)RuPPh3].21 The sample points
concentrate around averages ρav = −39.0°
and φav = 27.7° for the (PPPh3) diastereomers and ρav = 39.3°
and φav = 25.7° for the (MPPh3) diastereomers. This is surprising because
L and L′ and the substituents in the π-Ar ligand of the
(π-Ar)LL′Ru fragments vary considerably. In all of the
140 cases of Figure 7, there is no exception with ρ > 60° such as GIRYIP[1]
in Figure 6.

angle ρ versus angle φ plane Phface/edge/plane

states for the interconversion of HEDYIY and HEDYOE.

With a rotation angle of ρ = −5.1°,
PIGJOG22 is almost in the middle between
HEDYIY and HEDYOE
(Figure 5). PIGJOG
is even more perfectly stabilized than HEDYIY and HEDYOE, as apparent
from distances CAr-Ci = 3.28 and 3.31 Å
as well as (π-Ar)CH-Co = 2.68 and 2.75 Å and
(π-Ar)CH-Ci = 2.84 and 2.89 Å. When PIGJOG is
very highly stabilized, the question arises, why do the rotation angles
ρ of Phface concentrate around ±40° and
not around 0°? The reason is the eclipsing interaction of the
other two phenyls with substituents L and L′ in three-legged
sandwich fragment (π-Ar)LL′M. PIGJOG’s substituent
L = H2BHNMe3 is in a plane with Arcent, Ru, and P perpendicular to the plane of the paper, and the two
phenyls stagger L perfectly (Figure 5). Thus, ±40° is a compromise of Phface to establish PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar stabilization
and to avoid eclipsing of the other two phenyls with L and L′.

Interconversion of Propeller Diastereomers
The interconversion
of diastereomers HEDYIY and HEDYOE, differing only in the propeller
configuration, can occur by two different pathways: (a) Phface of HEDYIY is converted to Phface of HEDYOE via a transition
state about ρ = 0° and vice versa and (b) Phface of HEDYIY is converted to Phedge of HEDYOE via a transition
state about ρ = 60° and vice versa (Figures 6 and 7). Both pathways
require only small intramolecular rotations of ρ and τ,
far below full phenyl rotations.

Pathway a inverts the chirality
of Ru-Phface from (MPh) in
HEDYIY to (PPh) in HEDYOE and exchanges inCo/m of Phface to outCo/m. In addition, it brings Phtrans of HEDYIY up
into the position of Phedge of HEDYOE and it moves Phedge of HEDYIY down to the position of Phtrans of
HEDYOE. In pathway a, Phface passes through conformations
with rotation angles ρ around 0° similar to the conformation
of PIGJOG in Figure 5. Because these conformations are highly stabilized, pathway a would
be energetically favorable for Phface. However, as discussed
above, rotation angles of Phface around 0° imply the
eclipsing of the other two phenyls with substituents L and L′,
which makes the area of Phface around 0° a transition
state.

Pathway b, although interchanging diastereomers HEDYIY
and HEDYOE,
does not change the (MPh) chirality, and
it does not exchange inCo/m of Phface to outCo/m of the phenyl in question. In addition,
this rotation brings Phedge of HEDYIY into the position
of Phface of HEDYOE and it converts Phtrans of
HEDYIY to Phtrans of HEDYOE. Thus, Phtrans stays
Phtrans, but it inverts its chirality. Pathway b does not
involve the eclipsing situation of pathway a.

It is well known
that sample points of conformations, retrieved
from the Cambridge Crystallographic Data file, concentrate in low-energy
areas and thin out toward transition states.23 Therefore, the high population of the areas at about ρ = |40°|
in Figures 6 and 7 by sample points means that these structures are
favorable molecular conformations. On the other hand, the thinning
out of sample points on the two sides of the energy minimum ρ
= |40°| indicates the approximation to transition states. Furthermore,
the distribution of sample points in the areas of the two transition
states allows a differentiation between pathways a and b of the (PPh)/(MPh) interconversion
of Phface. At about ρ = 0°, sample points not
only thin out but disappear completely (Figures 6 and 7). That means,
rotation angles about ρ = 0° correspond to a high-lying
transition state. On the other hand, sample points of (MPh)-Phface and (PPh)-Phedge about ρ = 60° overlap, indicating
a low-lying transition state.

The process of diastereomer interconversion
along pathways a and
b is shown at the bottom of Figure 7 on the right side. In pathway b, starting with HEDYIY
at ρ = 37.3°, the transition state is reached at about
ρ = 60° to finally arrive at HEDYOE with ρ = 80°.
The process on the right side of Figure 6 would be similar. This low-energy pathway,
far below full rotations around the Ci-P and P-Ru axes,
is corroborated by the experimental sample points in Figure 7. The use of such experimental
data to find reaction pathways has been pioneered by Dunitz et al.23

Whereas in the crystal, the PPh3 propeller configurations
are fixed, in solution, they rapidly interconvert. For the 18 propeller
diastereomers, pathway b seems to be the easiest mechanism of interconversion.
This discussion concentrated on Phface and did not take
into account a detailed consideration of Phedge and Phtrans. In addition, it must be kept in mind that each of the
three phenyls has to carry out its duty in the internal stabilization
of the PPh3 propeller.

Density Functional Theory
(DFT) Calculations
We checked
the results, obtained in the analysis of CSD sample points, by DFT
calculations24 (RI25-B3LYP26/def2-TZVP25b,27). Using the cif files, we calculated the ground-state structures
of HEDYIY and HEDYOE. HEDYOE turned out to be more stable than HEDYIY
by 2.68 kJ/mol. The energy difference of 2.68 kJ/mol would account
for a ratio HEDYIY/HEDYOE = 1:3 at 20 °C. Going from the conformation
in the crystal to the conformation in the gas phase, the rotation
angle changes for HEDYIY from ρ = 37.3 to 47.4° and for
HEDYOE from ρ = −28.7 to −21.6°.

Our
sample point analysis had predicted a low-lying transition state for
the conversion of Phface of HEDYIY to Phedge of HEDYOE, resulting in the interconversion of the two diastereomers.
This low transition state was reached after a counter-clockwise rotation
of the PPh3 ligand in HEDYIY, which moved Phface from its position ρ = 37° in the crystal to 60°
(pathway b). We calculated the relative energies of HEDYIY with the
PPh3 ligand rotated from its gas phase ground state ρ
= 47.7 to 50.3° and 59.4°. The relative energies rose from
0 via 0.75 to 4.66 kJ/mol (Figure 8), supporting a low-lying transition state at 60°.

Figure 8 Relative
energies of HEDYIY in its ground state at rotation angle
ρ = 47.4° and on its way to the low transition state at
ρ = 60° and the high transition state at ρ = 0°.

In the sample point analysis,
we had assigned a high-lying transition
state to a clockwise rotation of Phface from ρ =
37.3 to 0°, which converts Phface of HEDYIY to Phface of HEDYOE (pathway a). The calculation of the relative
energies of HEDYIY with the PPh3 ligand rotated from ρ
= 47.7 to 21.9° and 1.1° gave relative energies from 0 via
13.50 to 24.31 kJ/mol (Figure 8). Thus, the transition state of pathway a is much higher
than that of pathway b and the results of sample point analysis and
DFT calculations are fully in accord. As expected, the relative energies
of the transition states are much higher than the ground state energies
of HEDYIY and HEDYOE.

α- and β-Effects
In
a recent paper, we
reported CH/π interactions between cyclopentadienyl and phenyl
rings in compounds of type CpM-L-E-Ph (Figure 9, left side), e.g., CpMo(CO)2-amidinato
and -thioamidato complexes.28 These compounds
were among the earliest examples, for which CH/π interactions
have been observed. The Cp/Ph attraction had been termed the β-phenyl
effect because of the β-position of Ph in the ligands.29 In comparison, the PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar system of the present paper is an α-phenyl
effect.

Figure 9 β-Phenyl effect in CpM-L-E-Ph compounds and α- and
β-phenyl effects in HEDYIY.

In new compounds (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)PPh3]PF6, (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 [1], [2], and [3] and
in HEDYIY and HEDYOE,
CH/π interactions are established between Ar and the phenyl
ring of the CHMePh substituent, resulting in short (π-Ar)CH-Ci and (π-Ar)CH-Co contacts far below the sum
of the van der Waals radii. The dashed lines in Figure 9, right side, show the C6H6/Ph interactions in HEDYIY. An analysis according to ref (26) is given in Table S4 (Supporting Information).

The
results in Table S4 reveal interesting
differences between the compounds with and without π-stack stabilization.
The two compounds (RRu,SC)-[CyRu(1O-2N)PPh3]PF6 [3] and
HEDYOE, lacking π-stacks, have appreciably shorter (π-Ar)CH-Ci and (π-Ar)CH-Co distances than those in
the four compounds containing π-stacks. Obviously, the π-stacks
prevent a perfect build-up of the β-CH/π interactions
and the better β-CH/π stabilization seems to be a compensation
for the absence of π-stack formation.

Conclusions
Chiral-at-metal half-sandwich compounds [(π-Ar)LL′MPPh3] form diastereomers, which differ in the propeller sense
of the triphenylphosphine ligand. The inside of the PPh3 ligand is stabilized by a system of attractive CH/π interactions,
in which each phenyl ring plays a specific role. One of the phenyl
rings orients face-on toward the π-arene ligand, establishing
a ubiquitous PhPPh3 face-on π-Ar bonding
motif. Interconversion of the propeller diastereomers occurs by a
low-energy pathway, which exchanges Phface and Phedge of the diastereomers.

Experimental Section
General Methods
For IR, JASCO FT/IR4100ST was used. For 1H/31P{1H} NMR, Bruker Avance 400 (400/162 MHz, T = 293 K) or Bruker Avance III 500 (500/202 MHz, T = 293 K) were used. Tetramethylsilane was used
as the internal standard, and H3PO4 was used
as the external standard. For MS, Finnigan MAT 95 (EI, 70 eV) or ThermoQuest
Finnigan TSQ 7000 was used. All manipulations were carried out in
purified nitrogen or argon. The Cambridge Structural Database ver.
5.38 (update May 31, 2017) for the 140 compounds of type [(π-C6R6)RuLL′PPh3] was used.21 The OLEX2,30 Mercury CSD ver. 3.9,31 and ConQuest ver. 1.1932 programs were
used for structural analyses.

To a solution of (S)-1-[[(1-phenylethyl)imino]methyl]-2-naphthalenol2 (200 mg, 0.73 mmol) in dichloromethane (20 mL) was added
potassium t-butoxide (98 mg, 0.88 mmol). The solution
was stirred for 1 h at room temperature and then cooled to −78
°C. [(η6-p-Cymene)RuCl]2Cl2 (250 mg, 0.36 mmol) was added to the cooled
solution. The mixture was slowly warmed up to room temperature, stirred
for 16 h, and then filtered on a short Celite column. After evaporation
of the solvent, the residue was chromatographed on silica gel using
EtOAc/hexane as an eluent. A reddish-brown band was collected and
evaporated to give (RRu,SC)/(SRu,SC)-[CyRu(2O-1N)Cl] 88:12 as a red powder in 70% yield
(280 mg). Mp 125 °C (color changed from red to brown) > 200
