Three
efficient and high-yielding procedures have been developed
for the conversion of primary amides into nitriles, mediated by hitherto
unexplored P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3. The reactions were conducted under operationally simple
and mild conditions and displayed broad substrate scope and good functional
group tolerance.

Introduction
Nitriles
are valuable structural motifs in organic chemistry. They
can be easily converted to many other functional groups such as carboxylic
acids, amines, and ketones and can be used as precursors of a large
number of molecules of commercial significance such as pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals, polymers, and other material molecules.1−3 Moreover, the cyano group itself is present in a large number of
biologically active molecules4,5 and in materials possessing
important electronic and mechanical properties.6,7 For
instance, many blockbuster nitrile-containing drugs, such as saxagliptin,8 anastrozole,9 and
cimetidine,10 are prescribed for a diverse
array of medical indications. The cyano group is also present in HIV
protease and 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors and many other medicinally
important molecules.11,12

Dehydration of primary
amides is one of the most used methods for
the preparation of nitriles.13 Traditionally,
the dehydration reaction was achieved using basic dehydrating agents
such as sodium hydroxide,14 lithium hydride,15n-butyl lithium,16 and silazanes.17 The
use of Lewis acids as dehydrating agents, such as P2O5,18 TiCl4,19 AlCl3/NaI,20 PdCl2,21 and ZnCl2,22 has been also documented. More recently,
other dehydrating systems giving higher yields have been introduced,
such as EtOP(O)Cl2/1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU),23 (EtO)2P(O)Cl,24 silanes/transition metal catalysts,25 silicotungstate [n-Bu4N]4[α-H4SiW11O39],26 [Et2NSF2]BF4 (XtalFluor-E),27 and (COCl)2/Et3N/Ph3PO.28

Herein, we report three convenient and efficient protocols for
the conversion of primary amides into nitriles mediated by P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3. These
new dehydration processes are facilitated by the ease of primary amides
to undergo coupling with the highly electrophilic phosphorus-III reagents,
tris(dimethylamino)phosphine, phosphorus trichloride, or triphenylphosphite,
followed by rapid elimination with diethylamine or DBU to form the
corresponding nitriles. While a wide variety of dehydrating agents
were used to effect this transformation, the mild, readily available,
and low-cost reagents, P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3, applied in these newly developed protocols,
to our knowledge, are unprecedented.

Results and Discussion
To establish the optimum conditions for the dehydration reaction,
we used benzamide (1a) as the model substrate. The reaction
was studied with three different commercially available and low-cost
phosphorus-III promoters, P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3, in combination with different bases,
under various conditions. The results of these comparative experiments
are summarized in Table 1. At the outset of the study, the reaction was performed in the absence
of any promoter or base, but no desired product 2a was
obtained in that case (Table 1, entries 1 and 2). When using P(NMe2)3 (2 equiv) as the promoter in the presence of triethylamine, pyridine,
benzylamine, or DBU as the base (3 equiv), the reaction furnished
the desired product in low to moderate yields (Table 1, entries 3–6). An improvement in
the yield of 2a to 88% was, however, observed when employing
diethylamine (3 equiv) as the base in refluxing CHCl3 (Table 1, entry 7). The promising
results obtained with P(NMe2)3/Et2NH as the dehydrating system prompted us to further investigate the
effect of solvents on the reaction yield. A variety of solvents including
CHCl3, toluene, EtOH, CH2Cl2, and
MeCN were tested (Table 1, entries 7–11). The best results were recorded with CHCl3 which gave an 88% yield of 2a after 6 h at reflux
temperature (Table 1, entry 7). Reducing the amounts of P(NMe2)3 and Et2NH to 1 and 2 molar equivalents, respectively,
led to a diminished yield (Table 1, entry 12). On the other hand, performing the reaction
under solvent-free conditions, with thermal heating or microwave irradiation,
could not improve the reactivity, and lower than 50% yield was obtained
in these cases (Table 1, entries 13 and 14).

were conducted with 2 equiv of promoter and 3 equiv of base as optimized
quantities.

monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC).

d One equivalent of P(NMe2)3 and 2 equiv of Et2NH were used.

e Entries
14, 17, 20, and 21 were
conducted under microwave irradiation (150 °C, 300 W).

When using PCl3 as the
promoter at the optimized conditions
obtained above [i.e., PCl3 (2 equiv), Et2NH
(3 equiv), and CHCl3 as the solvents at 62 °C], the
desired product 2a was obtained with a better yield of
92% after 40 min (Table 1, entry 15).

Switching to triphenylphosphite, at the same reaction
conditions,
brought no improvement and only provided a 40% yield of 2a (Table 1, entry 18).
However, performing the reaction under solvent-free conditions, with
microwave irradiation, in the presence of DBU as the base, allowed
the reaction to proceed efficiently and afforded 2a in
91% isolated yield after 4 min at 150 °C (Table 1, entry 21).

Accordingly, three efficient
and high-yielding methods could be
deduced for the conversion of primary amides into nitriles, mediated
by P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3: Method A [P(NMe2)3 (2 equiv), Et2NH (3 equiv), in refluxing CHCl3 for 6 h], Method B [PCl3 (2 equiv), Et2NH (3 equiv), in refluxing CHCl3 for 40 min], and Method C [P(OPh)3 (2 equiv), DBU (3 equiv), neat, microwave irradiation at
150 °C for 4 min].

We next investigate the scope and generality
of the three established
methods by using a variety of structurally diverse primary amides.29 The results indicated that the three methods
displayed wide substrate scope and good functional group compatibility,
affording the desired nitriles in good-to-excellent yields (Table 2). The reactions proceeded
efficiently with aliphatic, aromatic, and heteroaromatic carboxamides
bearing electron-withdrawing or electron-donating groups. In general,
aromatic amides bearing electron-donating groups gave slightly higher
yields than those containing electron-withdrawing groups on the aromatic
rings (Table 2, entries
1–4). This can be attributed to the substituent’s effects
on the nucleophilicity of the imidic acid-tautomer oxygen atom (Scheme 1). Electron-donating
groups on the aromatic ring would increase the nucleophilicity of
that oxygen atom and therefore enhance the nucleophilic substitution
rate between the phosphorus-III promoter and the imidic acid tautomer
form. Aliphatic amides were also used in these protocols, affording
the desired nitriles with good-to-high reaction yields (Table 2, entries 5 and 6). The three
protocols were also found to be tolerant toward β-cyanoamides,
malonamide, and α,β-unsaturated amides, allowing good
yields of the corresponding nitriles (Table 2, entries 7–11). To further extend
the scope and utility of these procedures, we examined the behavior
of 2-aminothiophene-3-carboxamides (Table 2, entries 12–15). In all these cases,
the reactions were compatible with the thiophene ring and the unprotected
amine functionality and furnished the corresponding 2-aminothiophene-3-carbonitriles
in moderate-to-good yields.

A, B, and C

a The progress of
the reactions was

b Isolated
yield after purification

By comparison of the three developed protocols, it could be concluded
from Table 2 that method
B, which uses PCl3 as the promoter, gave in general slightly
higher yields than methods A and C. This can be attributed to the
better reactivity of PCl3 compared to P(NMe2)3 and P(OPh)3. However, in the case of 2-aminothiophene-3-carboxamides
(Table 2, entries 12–15),
method C was found to be more suitable probably because of the fact
that the P(OPh)3 promoter used, which is less reactive
than PCl3 and P(NMe2)3, is more selective
toward nucleophilic substitution with the imidic acid-tautomer oxygen
atom (Scheme 1), therefore
minimizing any competitive substitution with the NH2 moiety
on the thiophene ring.

It should be mentioned that under microwave
conditions, the more
stable and less volatile P(OPh)3 promoter gave the best
results (Table 1, entries
14, 17, 20, and 21), allowing for method C which, performed under
microwave irradiation and in solvent-free conditions, offers significant
advantages such as short reaction times, easy work-up, and environmental
safety.

On the basis of our experimental results and the known
literature
precedents,23 a mechanistic rationalization
for protocols A, B, and C is provided in Scheme 1. First of all, the primary amide undergoes
a selective O-phosphinylation, through its imidic
acid tautomer, with the hard acid phosphorus-III promoter. The obtained
intermediate permits rapid elimination in the presence of diethylamine
or DBU as the base, to afford the final nitrile.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully developed three efficient and
simple methodologies for the conversion of primary amides into nitriles,
mediated by the mild, readily available, and low-cost phosphorus-III
reagents P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3. These synthetic strategies offer significant advantages,
such as good-to-excellent yields, wide substrate scope, good functional
group compatibility, mild reaction conditions, short reaction times,
easy work-up, and environmental safety, which make these protocols
more amenable for high throughput library synthesis.

Experimental
Section
General
Commercially available analytical grade reagents
and solvents were used without further purification. Melting points
were determined in open glass capillaries and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded with CDCl3 as the solvent, on a Bruker AC-300 spectrometer operating
at 300.1 MHz for 1H and 75.5 MHz for 13C. IR
spectra were recorded on a Nicolet IR200 spectrometer. The progress
of the reactions was monitored by TLC, using 5 × 20 cm plates
with a layer thickness of 0.25 mm (silica gel 60 F254) and a mixture
of ether and hexane (1:1) as the eluent. Purification of products
was performed by column chromatography using silica gel (70–230
mesh size).

General Procedures for the Conversion of
Primary Amides into
Nitriles Mediated by P(NMe2)3, PCl3, or P(OPh)3
Method A
A mixture of primary amide
(1 mmol), tris(dimethylamino)phosphine
(2 mmol), and diethylamine (3 mmol) in CHCl3 (5 mL) was
stirred at reflux temperature for 6–12 h (Table 2). The reaction mixture was
then cooled to room temperature and washed with a saturated NH4Cl solution (5 mL) and then with water (2 × 5 mL). The
organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated
under vacuum. The crude product obtained was purified by silica gel
column chromatography using a mixture of ether and hexane (1:1) as
the eluent.

Method B
To a mixture of primary
amide (1 mmol) and
diethylamine (3 mmol) in CHCl3 (5 mL), cooled at 0 °C,
phosphorus trichloride (2 mmol) was added dropwise with stirring within
15 min. The resulting mixture was then heated under reflux with constant
stirring for 0.5–5 h (Table 2). After cooling to room temperature, the reaction
mixture was washed with a saturated NH4Cl solution (5 mL)
and then with water (2 × 5 mL). The organic phase was dried over
Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The crude
product obtained was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using a mixture of ether and hexane (1:1) as the eluent.

Method C
The primary amide (1 mmol), triphenylphosphite
(2 mmol), and DBU (3 mmol) were placed in a 10 mL microwave reaction
tube. The mixture was subjected to microwave irradiation (CEM Discover,
150 °C, 300 W) for 3–7 min (Table 2). After cooling to room temperature, the
reaction mixture was diluted with CHCl3 (5 mL) and washed
with a saturated NH4Cl solution (5 mL) and then with water
(2 × 5 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under vacuum. The crude product obtained
was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a mixture of
ether and hexane (1:1) as the eluent.

All synthesized nitriles
are known compounds and showed physical and spectral properties identical
to those reported in the literature.
