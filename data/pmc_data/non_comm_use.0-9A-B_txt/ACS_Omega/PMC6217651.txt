Pure TiO2 and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
are synthesized by the biomediated green approach using the Bengal
gram bean extract. The extract containing biomolecules acts as capping
agent, which helps to control the size of nanoparticles and inhibit
the agglomeration of particles. Copper is doped in TiO2 to enhance the electronic conductivity of TiO2 and its
electrochemical performance. The Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticle-based
anode shows high specific capacitance, good cycling stability, and
rate capability performance for its envisaged application in lithium-ion
battery. Among pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2,
and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 anode, the latter shows the highest
capacity of 250 mAh g–1 (97.6% capacity retention)
after 100 cycles and more than 99% of coulombic efficiency at 0.5
A g–1 current density. The improved electrochemical
performance in the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 is attributed to the
synergetic effect between copper and titania. The results reveal that
Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles might be contributing to the
enhanced electronic conductivity, providing an efficient pathway for
fast electron transfer.

Introduction
Renewable energy sources such as solar,
wind, hydropower, and geothermal energies are among the green alternative
energy source options to the natural energy sources (coal, oil, natural
gas, etc.). Furthermore, these renewable energy sources are carbon-free
and contribute to decrease the global warming issues. However, these
energy sources suffer from the limitation of generating continuous
energy because these often rely on weather for generation of power.
So, in such conditions, energy-storage devices play an important role
to store the generated energy from the renewable energy sources when
available, and it can be used as per requirement. Besides this, storage
devices are used as a source of energy in portable devices and hybrid
electric vehicles, which contribute to reducing greenhouse (CO2) gases and environmental pollution. Considering the urgency
and need for preferably solid-state storage devices, researchers developed
different energy-storage devices such as lithium-ion battery (LIB),1 supercapacitor,2,3 Ni-MH battery,4 etc. Among these energy-storage devices, lithium-ion
battery (LIB) is a promising candidate due to its high power density,
long-term life, and environmentally benign nature.1,5−7 However, the
key factor affecting the performance of LIBs is the anode material.
Recent reports show that natural graphite is commonly used as the
anode material in commercial LIBs due to its credibility and low operating
voltage (<0.2 V vs Li+/Li). The diffusion rate of lithium
into carbon materials is between 10–12 and 10–6 cm2 s–1 at a low operating
voltage (<0.2 V vs Li+/Li) and hence the possibility
of formation of solid electrolyte interface (SEI) layer at low voltage
is more. Interestingly, for graphite, it is between 10–9 and 10–7 cm2 s–1 and
demonstrates high volume expansion (∼10%), which results in
batteries with low power density. Thus, there is dire need to develop
alternative high-operating-voltage electrode materials, which would
circumvent these limitations, particularly for large battery development.8,9 As a result, the researchers have focused their attention on the
development of different kinds of intercalation- and deintercalation-based
electrode materials, such as graphite, carbon, Li4TiO2, and TiO2.10−12 Several transition-metal oxide materials have been explored as alternative
anode material to graphitic carbon.13−15 Among them, TiO2 is an ideal anode material
for LIBs, due to its low cost, nontoxicity, high capacity, long cycle
life, and very low volume change (∼4%) during Li+ intercalation/deintercalation. Besides, another intriguing incentive
is the higher operating voltage of TiO2 (>1.5 V vs Li+/Li) than the graphite anode, which could effectively stop
the formation of Li dendrites and lithium electroplating.16 Even though TiO2-based materials
possess many advantages, they still encounter a big challenge of poor
reversibility during charge–discharge, poor rate capability,
poor electronic conductivity (10–12–10–7 S cm–1), and poor ionic conductivity,
which lead to poor electrochemical performance, thereby hampering
its practical applications.17−19

One of the most commonly used strategies is to design TiO2-based composites with conducting carbon materials (graphene,
CNTs, etc.); however, introducing a large quantity of carbon reduces
the capacity of electrode material. Thus, strategies to develop new
methodologies and materials to improve the electronic conductivity
are the need of time. Recent literature reports reveal that metal
doping exhibits considerable advantages to alter the intrinsic conductivity
and rate capability of anode material (metal oxides).20−25 It is reported
that the doping of metal ion can improve the conductivity of transition-metal
oxides (TiO2, Li4Ti5O12–TiO2, and MnO2). Zhang et al.18 synthesized Cu-doped TiO2 nanowires
demonstrating enhanced conductivity and electrochemical kinetic properties
via decreasing the band gap of TiO2 nanowires. Chen et
al.10 synthesized Cu-doped dual-phase Li4Ti5O12–TiO2 exhibiting
enhanced capacity, cycle performance, and rate capability. Li et al.26 synthesized Cu-doped MnO2 nanoparticles
with improved electronic conductivity and lithium diffusivity in electrodes.
Therefore, it is realized that Cu doping can improve the capacity,
cycle performance, and rate capability of transition-metal oxides,
which is attributed to the narrowing of the band gap and enhancing
electronic conductivity. With this motivation, in this work, we have
synthesized Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles by using our previously
reported biogreen method, which is simple, economic, and scalable.

In the typical process, Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
are synthesized by a facile, cost-effective, scalable, and eco-friendly
approach using remnant water (ideally kitchen waste) collected from
soaked Bengal gram beans (Cicer arietinum L.). The gram bean extract containing pectin biomolecules are responsible
for the synthesis of Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Pectin
is a complex polysaccharide that is present in most primary cell walls
and it acts as a capping agent and hinders the aggregation. Interestingly,
when a Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticle-based thin film is used
as an anode material for LIBs, it demonstrates the high capacity and
excellent rate capability compared to pure TiO2. This improvement
can be due to the decrease in the band gap, which helps to enhance
the electronic conductivity of TiO2. The effect of Cu doping
concentration (3 and 7 wt % Cu-doped TiO2) is also studied.
The results indicate that Cu-doped TiO2 is a promising
anode material for high-performance LIBs.

Results and Discussion
X-ray Diffraction
(XRD) Pattern
Confirmation of phase composition, crystal
structure, and crystallite size of the synthesized (a) pure TiO2, (b) 3 wt % Cu-doped TiO2, and (c) 7 wt % Cu-doped
TiO2 nanoparticles is carried out using powder XRD, and
the results are shown in Figure 1. The XRD spectra of the samples showed well-defined
diffraction peaks, which could be indexed to the anatase phase of
TiO2 (JCPDS card No. 71-1168) belonging to the tetragonal
structure with space group I41/amd (141).27 The peaks in pure
TiO2 are attributed to the reflection from (101), (004),
(200), (105), (211), (204), (116), (220), and (215) planes of the
anatase phase (Figure 1a). XRD spectra of Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are shown
in Figure 1b,c with
characteristic peaks originating from a pure TiO2 sample
representing the tetragonal anatase phase of TiO2. No obvious
peaks corresponding to Cu or any copper oxide phases are observed
in the diffraction spectra of Cu-doped TiO2. This does
not mean that Cu-associated phases in the system are absent, but probably
the diffraction from TiO2 surface is more intense compared
to the Cu-oxide reflected rays (covered by TiO2), resulting
in the Cu-oxide’s peak intensity ratio being less compared
to that of TiO2. The (200) diffraction peak shifts slightly
to lower 2θ values in the Cu-doped TiO2 (inset in Figure 1).28Figure 1 clearly shows that the intensity of Cu-doped TiO2 peaks
is higher compared to pure TiO2, which indicates that Cu-doping
enhances the crystallinity and improves the structural quality of
TiO2. The crystallite sizes of pure TiO2, 3%
Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 were calculated
with reference to (101) peak at 2θ = 24.9 and found to be ∼10,
14, and 11 nm, respectively.

diffraction pattern of biosynthesized (a) pure TiO2, (b)
3% Cu-doped TiO2, and (c) 7% Cu-doped TiO2.

Figure S1a–c shows the Rietveld refinement plot of pure and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. The lattice parameter (a, b, and c) values of Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles reveal a minor increase in the ″a″ lattice parameter and minor decrease in the ″c″ lattice parameters compared to the pure TiO2 (results tabulated in Table S1).29 The result indicates that the Cu
dopants are adequately incorporated in the TiO2 lattice
expanding the unit cell volume compared to the pure TiO2 cell volume (Table S1).

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectroscopy is
a simple and important technique for confirmation of structural phase
of pure and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles, and the results
are shown in Figure 2. For all of the samples, the Raman spectra show six Raman-active
modes (Eg, Eg, B1g, B1g + A1g, and Eg), which indicates that the anatase
phase of TiO2 is predominant.30,31 The
Raman peaks were observed at 146, 199, 397, 516, and 642 cm–1 for pure TiO2 and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles,
illustrating a similar Raman peak pattern to the anatase phase of
TiO2, and it is in agreement with the reported literature.32,33 Furthermore, no extra peak associated with copper oxide is observed
even at a higher concentration of Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles.
It means that Raman spectroscopy data is in good agreement with the
XRD results. Moreover, Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles retain
the anatase structure, which indicates that the Cu cations are incorporated
into the TiO2 framework. Interestingly, it has been observed
that the Raman peak at 146 cm–1 (inset in Figure 2) tends to shift
to a higher wavenumber with an increase in Cu dopant. Generally, it
has been accepted that the shifts in the Raman peak occur due to the
change in bond polarizability and strength of the Ti–O bond
upon Cu doping. These changes in bond strength are clearly observed
in the Rietveld refinement results (Figure S1).30

X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS is a crucial analysis
technique to determine the elemental composition of a substance and
their oxidation states.30,34Figure 3a shows XPS survey spectra of pure TiO2 and Cu-doped TiO2. In the survey spectra of pure
TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 spectra, four common XPS peaks at around 284–286,
258–260, 464–466, and 529–531 eV are observed,
which are characteristic of C 1s, Ti 2P3/2, Ti 2P3/1, and O 1s, respectively. However, in the case of Cu-doped TiO2 samples, the XPS images showed two extra peaks at around
931–953 eV (apart from the four common peaks), which are characteristic
of Cu 2P (Cu 2P3/2 and Cu 2P2/1) supporting
the fact that copper is successfully doped in TiO2.3535 XPS images revealing
the characteristic peaks of individual elements were also recorded
as shown in Figure 3. The XPS image characteristic of Ti shows two peaks (Figure 3b) at ∼459 (Ti 2p3/2) and 465 eV (Ti 2P1/2) (pure TiO2), which suggests that Ti exists in Ti(IV) state, which is in good
agreement with the literature report. But in the case of Cu-doped
TiO2 (Figure 3b), these peaks shift slightly downward at ∼458.5 and 464.6
eV, which suggest the substitution of Ti(IV) by Cu1+ ions.
The XPS image characteristic of O in pure TiO2 shows a
peak at 530.6 eV (O 1s) (Figure 3c), which is in good agreement with the literature
report. On the other hand, in the case of Cu-doped TiO2, it is observed to have shifted to 530 eV. This can be attributed
to the formation of oxygen vacancies after Cu doping in TiO2. Furthermore, in the case of Cu-doped TiO2, the XPS images
revealed two additional peaks at 932 and 952 eV, which could be assigned
to Cu 2P3/2 and Cu 2P2/1, respectively (Figure 3d), and could be
attributed to the characteristic peaks of Cu2O. This observation
was in good agreement with the literature report36,37 and
revealed that the doped Cu in TiO2 is in Cu(I) oxidation
state.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The surface morphology and elemental analysis of the
biosynthesized pure and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are
also examined by SEM and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) pattern, and
the results are shown in Figure 4. The micrographs of (a) pure TiO2, (b)
3% Cu-doped TiO2, and (c) 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
calcined at 400 °C are shown in Figure 4a–c, which demonstrate the uniform
spherical-shaped nanoparticles with narrow size distribution. No major
change in the morphology of the Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
is observed compared to pure TiO2. Furthermore, representative
EDX patterns of pure TiO2 and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were recorded to investigate the elemental composition,
and the results are shown in Figure 4d. The EDX pattern of pure TiO2 (Figure 4d) clearly shows
the exclusive presence of Ti and O element, which confirms the absence
of impurities in the pure TiO2 nanoparticles. Similarly,
the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 (Figure 4d) shows the presence of Cu, Ti, and O elements,
confirming the successful incorporation of copper ion in TiO2.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
(TEM)
TEM is an advanced analysis technique to determine
the morphology and crystallite size of the nanoparticles. TEM images
of pure and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Figure 5, which clearly show
the uniform distribution of spherical-shaped nanoparticles (Figure 5a,c). High-resolution
TEM (HR-TEM) images of pure and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
(Figure 5b,d) demonstrate
well-defined fringes, indicating the crystalline nature of the samples.
The interspacing distance between the fringes are 3.562 and 3.569
Å for pure TiO2 and 7% Cu-doped TiO2, respectively.
The interspacing distance is slightly higher in 7% Cu-doped TiO2 compared to pure TiO2, which is attributed to
the successful doping of Cu in TiO2. In addition, Figure 5e,f exhibits the
particle size distribution histogram of pure and 7% Cu-doped TiO2, which clearly shows that the average crystallite size of
Cu-doped TiO2 (∼11.9 nm) is greater than that of
pure TiO2 (∼9.5 nm) due to the large ionic radius
of copper. The role of gram bean extract in controlling the agglomeration
and particle size is elucidated from the TEM images and particle size
distribution histograms recorded from TiO2 nanoparticles
prepared without and with gram bean extract (Figure S2).

Electrochemical Characterization
Electrochemical performances were investigated to understand the
Cu-doping effects on the TiO2 structure by galvanostatic
analysis using TiO2/Li half-cell configuration in the voltage
window of 0.01–3 V at ambient temperature for LIB application.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) profiles of pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped
TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are
carried out at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s–1 in a potential
range of 0.01–3 V to explore the lithium insertion/extraction
behavior. The initial five successive CV curves of the pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles are shown in Figure 6a–c. Figure 6a–c displays the location of the first cathodic
CV peaks (∼1.66 V), which is different from those in the following
four cycles. Besides this, in the first discharge CV curve, two extra
peaks are observed in the potential range 0.5–1.5 V (vs Li/Li+) and these two extra peaks (∼0.62 V and in between
1.3 and 1.7 V) disappear in the next four CV curves. It means that
the specific current of the first CV curve is high compared to the
subsequent CV curves. It is attributed to the formation of solid electrolyte
interface (SEI) layer.38−40 In Figure 6a–c, a pair
of cathodic and anodic intense peaks remain after the first CV curve
at about 1.71 and 2.14 V versus Li/Li+. These two peaks
correspond to the Li-ion insertion into and extraction from the interstitial
octahedral site of TiO2, respectively. The sharp oxidation/reduction
peaks reveal the two-phase reaction process, showing the coexistence
of Li-poor Li0.01TiO2 (tetragonal) and Li-rich
Li0.55TiO2 (orthorhombic) phase. 1  The comparative CV curves of the
second cycles of all three anode materials are shown in Figure 6d. In the case of Cu-doped
TiO2 with sharp and intense oxidative and reductive peaks
along with two broad and less intense peaks also appear in subsequent
cycles. The cathodic peak at 0.73 V is attributed to the transformation
of Cu2O into Cu particles and Li2O, and the
anodic peak at 2.47 V is attributed to the formation of Cu2O.41−43 It is observed
that the peak intensity increases with the doping concentration of
copper. The overall electrochemical reaction for copper oxide can
be described as follows:43,44 2  Figure 6d shows the
comparison of second CV curves of all samples, which clearly show
that the intensity of oxidation (2.17 V) and reduction (1.71 V) peak
decreases with increase in Cu-doping concentration. This observation
indicates improved wetting and enhanced Li-ion insertion kinetics
with an increase in doping concentration of copper. Interestingly,
the shift is observed in 7% Cu-doped TiO2, which means
that the Li-ion insertion kinetics is higher in 7% Cu-doped TiO2 compared to the pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2.40,44,4540,44,45 The increase of Li-ion insertion
kinetics and wettability of copper-doped TiO2 electrode
material is due to the decrease in band gap with an increase in Cu-doping
concentration and the synergistic effect of copper and titania.46,47

cycle of each electrode material.

Figure 7 displays
the first six galvanostatic charge–discharge profiles of pure
TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 cell at the current rate of 0.05 A g–1 in
the potential window 0.01–3 V. With all of the three electrodes,
three potential plateaus are observed in the voltage regions of 1.6–1.8,
1.0–1.4, and 0.6–0.8 V for the first discharge cycle,
while the first charge cycle shows only one sloping line or potential
plateau at about ∼2.1 V. So, the charge–discharge profiles
of all sample are in good agreement with the first CV curves, as shown
in Figure 7a–c.

curves of the second cycle
for all nanopowder materials in the potential range of 0.01–3
V vs Li/Li+ for an applied scan rate of 0.05 A g–1.

Pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped
TiO2 show initial irreversible capacities of 514, 517,
and 748 mAh g–1, respectively. From the above results,
it is clear that the irreversible capacity values of the first discharge–charge
cycle increase with an increase in Cu concentration, which means that
the intercalated Li ions are not completely deintercalated, which
is attributed to the formation of SEI layer. This is commonly observed
for the first cycle in all electrode materials. The subsequent cycles
show low irreversible capacity, as shown in Figure 7a–c and Table S3. A comparison of the second charge–discharge cycle
of each electrode is shown in Figure 7d, which clearly shows that the second discharge capacities
for pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped
TiO2 are 296, 314, and 378 mAh g–1, respectively.
Interestingly, the second charge cycle of 7% Cu-doped TiO2 shows 353 mAh g–1 charge capacity, which is higher
than the theoretical capacity of TiO2 (335 mAh g–1). This may be attributed to increased conductivity of electrode
material by the Cu doping.41,48 From Figure 7 and Table S3, it is clear that the Cu-doped TiO2 shows better
electrochemical performance compared to the pure TiO2 nanoparticles,
revealing that copper contributes to the improved electronic conductivity
of TiO2 and synergetic effect of Cu and TiO2.

Influence of Cu-doping on electrochemical performance was
investigated by cycle stability and rate capability performance, and
the results are shown in Figure 8a,b, respectively. The cycling stability (Figure 8a) of each cell is
investigated up to 100 cycles at the current density of 0.5 A g–1 in the potential window 0.01–3 V. From the
cycle stability data, it is clear that the specific capacity value
of TiO2 increases with percentage increase of Cu doping.
Interestingly, the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 cell shows a high specific
capacity of 250 mAh g–1, which is higher than that
of pure TiO2 (180 mAh g–1) and 3% Cu-doped
(198 mAh g–1). After 100 cycles, it exhibits 97.6%
capacity retention because of the increase in the conductivity of
the electrode material due to the doping of Cu in TiO2.

TiO2 at 0.5 A g–1 current density. (b)
Rate performance of pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 at different current densities.

The rate performances of pure TiO2 and copper-doped
TiO2 at different current rates ranging from 0.05 to 2
A g–1 are investigated as shown in Figure 8b. It is observed that each
cell shows good rate capability, but exceptionally fading in initial
few cycles (at current rate 0.05 A g–1), which is
attributed to the loss of symmetry during phase transition accompanied
by a decrease in the unit cell along the c axis.
Furthermore, the subsequent increase of unit cell volume (∼4%)
along the b direction results in capacity fading.49 Among them, 7% Cu-doped TiO2 shows
high specific capacity at each current density compared to pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2. It delivers reversible specific
capacities of 378, 330, 279, 230, 186, and 157 mAh g–1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 A g–1 of current
density, respectively. It is clearly observed that even at the high
current density (2 A g–1) it shows 157 mAh g–1 of specific capacity, much higher than pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2 electrodes (119 and 134 mAh
g–1, respectively) (details of rate capability data
are given in Table S4). Interestingly,
when the current density returns after 2 A g–1 to
the current density of 0.1 A g–1, it shows a discharge
capacity of 299 mAh g–1 after 42 cycles and recovers
90% of capacity retention from the initial cycle at 0.1 A g–1, indicating very good rate capability of the material.

Furthermore,
to study the electrochemical kinetics of synthesized pure TiO2, 3% Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) study is performed.
It is used to examine the activity occurring at the electrode/electrolyte
interfaces and Li-ion intercalation/deintercalation within electrode
materials in the battery cells. Figure 9 shows the Nyquist plots of pure TiO2, 3%
Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2. Each Nyquist
plot is composed of the compressed semicircle (in the high- to medium-frequency
region) and a Warburg impedance (Zw) straight
line (in the low-frequency region) corresponding to the charge-transfer
resistance (Rct) between the electrolyte
and the electrode and Li+ ion diffusion in the electrode
material. From the Nyquist plot, the Rct values (diameters of the semicircle) for pure TiO2, 3%
Cu-doped TiO2, and 7% Cu-doped TiO2 are 117,
109, and 48.35 Ω, respectively. Among them, the 7% Cu-doped
TiO2 electrode material showed the lowest Rct value compared to the other electrode material, which
indicates that the electrode (7% Cu-doped TiO2) facilitates
easy and fast electronic transportation enhancing the conductivity.
The results indicate an enhancement in the Li+ ion diffusion
in the Cu-doped TiO2 electrode.

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized
the copper-doped TiO2 nanoparticles employing a biomediated
green approach using the Bengal gram bean extract. The synthesized
electrode materials are explored as an anode for lithium-ion battery
application. The Cu-doped TiO2 anodes show better charging–discharging
capacity than the pure TiO2 anode, which is due to the
enhanced conductivity and synergistic effect of the individual components
(Cu and TiO2). Interestingly, among the explored TiO2 electrode, the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 cell shows a higher
specific capacity compared to pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped
TiO2 cells. Besides, the 7% Cu-doped TiO2 anode
shows higher than 99% coulombic efficiency after 100 cycles compared
to pure TiO2 and 3% Cu-doped TiO2 at the 0.5
A g–1 current rate. Apart from this, the 7% Cu-doped
TiO2 anode shows better specific capacitance, cycling stability,
and rate capability performance, which is attributed to the contribution
of doped copper reducing the charge-transfer resistance (Rct) between the electrolyte and the electrode material
and enhancement in the Li-ion diffusion compared to pure TiO2 and the 3% Cu-doped TiO2. It is expected that this work
would pave new avenues for the scientific community to develop environmentally
benign metal-doped TiO2 nanoparticles using the Bengal
gram bean extract as a greener and economic approach. Furthermore,
metal doping is one of the best ways to enhance the electronic conductivity
of TiO2 nanoparticles and thus the study is underway to
understand the influence of other metal dopants and their varying
concentrations on the electrochemical performance for their application
in lithium-ion battery.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals
Titanium chloride
(TiCl4), copper(II) chloride dihydrate (CuCl2·2H2O), and ammonia (AR grade 28%) procured from
Merck were used as such without further purification for the synthesis
of Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles. Bengal gram beans (C. arietinum L.) were purchased from a local market
in Aurangabad, India.

Synthesis of
Gram Bean Extract
Dry Bengal gram beans (20 g, C. arietinum L.) were precleaned and soaked for 6
h in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water at room temperature (25 °C).
After 6 h, the soaked seeds were removed and the extract was subjected
to filtration using a glass fiber filter. The filtered solution was
used as gram bean extract for the synthesis of pure TiO2 and Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles.

Synthesis of Cu-Doped TiO2 Nanoparticles
In typical synthesis of 3 and 7 wt % Cu-doped TiO2 nanoparticles
using biosynthesis method, 6.9 mL of TiCl4 solution was
dropwise added into 10 mL of gram bean extract in two beakers separately
and further diluted to 50 mL. Copper chloride was used as a source
of copper and an appropriate amount of CuCl2·2H2O was added to this solution for having 3 wt % (0.40 g) and
7 wt % (0.94 g) Cu doping, respectively. Subsequently, the pH of the
solution was adjusted to 7 using ammonia solution to form titanium-hydroxide
pectin gel, which shrinks and inhibits the further growth of the nanoparticles.
The shrunk gel was washed with deionized water. The powder was dried
in an electric oven at 100 °C and subsequently calcined at 400
°C for 3 h to remove the organic contaminants. Pristine TiO2 was also prepared in the same way without doping copper ion
for better comparison. All Cu-doped TiO2 and pure TiO2 nanoparticles so produced were characterized for the confirmation
of their preliminary structural and morphological properties.

Material characterization
Bruker AXS
D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer equipped with Cu Kα1 radiation was used for powder X-ray diffraction measurement in the
range of 10–80°. Raman spectra were recorded using a UniG2D
Raman Spectroscope (UniNano Tech) with a 532 nm continuous-wave laser
as the light source. UV–visible diffuse reflectance spectra
of the samples were recorded using a UV–vis spectrophotometer
(LabIndia, UV 3092). The morphologies of the as-synthesized Cu-doped
TiO2 materials and calcined pure TiO2 were investigated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, JEOL, JSM 6500F microscope)
operating at 15 kV. Particle size and morphology of 7 wt % Cu-doped
TiO2 and pure TiO2 were recorded using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurement on an FEI Tecnai G2-F20 microscope
(Philips) with a field-emission gun operating at a 200 kV. Specimens
were prepared by ultrasonication of TiO2 nanoparticles
in ethanol, followed by dropping the suspension on a carbon-coated
copper grid.

Electrode and Coin Cell
Preparation for Electrochemical
The electrodes for the electrochemical
analysis were prepared by coating a composite slurry of 80 wt % of
active materials (Cu-doped TiO2), 15 wt % of conducting
carbon (super-P, timcal), and 5 wt % of poly(vinylidene difluoride)
binder prepared in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone on a carbon-coated
copper foil by using the doctor blade method, wherein the copper foil
act as a current collector. This composite-coated foil was then subsequently
dried at 60 °C for 24 h and then cut into a circular disk with
the help of a punching machine fitted with cutters suitable for coin
cells of CR2032. The material loadings in the range of 2.0–4.0
mg were achieved. The CR2032 cells for electrochemical testing were
assembled inside an argon-filled glovebox at an extremely low oxygen
level of less than 0.1 ppm. A metallic lithium (Li) disk was used
as both counter and reference electrodes in opposite sides. The two
electrodes were separated by a Whatman glass microfiber filter separator
soaked in the electrolyte solution. Lithium hexafluorophosphate (1
M, LiPF6) in 1:1 volume ratio of ethylene carbonate and
dimethyl carbonate mixture was used as the electrolyte. Cyclic voltammetry
(at a scan rate of 0.3 mV s–1) and impedance measurement
were carried out by an SP 300 Bio-Logic potentiostat. Galvanostatic
charge–discharge and cycling profile (at a constant current
density of 0.5 A g–1) measurements were carried
out using an MTI battery cycler in the potential window 0.01–3.0
V for half-cell configurations at ambient temperature conditions.
