Clean energy is the
main requirement for human life. Redox flow
battery may be an alternative to fossil fuels. An ion-exchange membrane
is the heart of the redox flow battery. In the present study, we synthesize
semi-interpenetrating cross-linked copolymer amphoteric ion-exchange
membranes (AIEMs) with a partially rigid backbone. The styrene sulfonate
and vinyl benzyl chloride monomers are used as the cationic and anionic
moieties into the AIEMs. Three different types of quaternizing agents
are used to convert a primary amine into a quaternary amine group.
Here, we avoid the use of the carcinogenic chemical CMME, commonly
used for the synthesis of anion-exchange membranes. The prepared membranes
exhibit good electrochemical and physicochemical properties with a
high acidic stability. The membranes also show moderate water uptake
and dimensional change. The ZWMO membrane shows better properties
among the AIEMs, with an ionic conductivity of 3.12 × 10–2 S cm–1 and 5.49 water molecules
per functional group. The anion and cation-exchange capacities of
the ZWMO membranes are calculated to be 1.11 and 0.62 mequiv/g. All
AIEMs show good thermal and mechanical stabilities, calculated by
differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, and
universal testing machine analysis. The membranes show low vanadium
ion permeability than the commercial membrane Nafion for their use
in vanadium redox flow batteries. Further, the AIEMs are applied in
redox flow batteries as separators and deliver good results with the
charging and discharging phenomena, with 87% voltage efficiency and
91% current efficiency.

Introduction
Vanadium redox flow
batteries (VRFBs) are considered to be a promising
system for energy storage because of their excellent features like
low cost, long life, easy operation, and deep discharge capability,
as well as high current efficiency.1−5 This pioneer work was done by Skyllas-Kazacos in 1985.6−8 However, increasing sustainable development of the world requires
huge amounts of energy.9,10 However, because of the instability in the supply
of electricity and intermittent nature, there is a demand for a large-scale
energy storage system. VRFBs are the prominent candidates that convert
chemical energy into electrical energy on a large scale for a long
time. In a redox flow battery, the four oxidation states formed by
the redox couples are separated by an ion-exchange membrane. So, an
ion-exchange membrane plays a key role in the operation of a redox
flow battery. This design mitigates the crossover contamination of
redox couples.11

Nafion is used as
a separator in VRFBs because of its good proton
conductivity and high chemical stability. However, the expensiveness
and VO2+ ion crossover limit its use.12 The cross-contamination of VO2+ ions between
the positive and electrolyte tanks would result in severe capacity
decay and voltage declination in an open circuit.9 Various other membranes are also available, but their uses
are limited because of the poor stability in the V+5 oxidation
state.13 Because of the high demand, researches
have been carried out to develop such kinds of ion-exchange membranes
which show good ionic conductivity (IC), bear good chemical stability,
as well as provide low VO2+ crossover across the membranes.
Different types of cation-exchange membranes have been developed containing
sulfonic acid groups such as sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) (SPEEK),
sulfonated poly(ether sulfone), and sulfonated polyimide for VRFBs
because of their extremely good proton conductivity and chemical and
mechanical stability.14−17 These sulfonated aromatic polymer-based IEMs are also being widely
used in direct methanol fuel cells because of their low methanol permeability.
However, as to attain high conductivity, a high degree of sulfonation
is desired, which may often result in their high swelling ratio and
reduced mechanical stability.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of different AIEMs.

Radiation grafting is also a method for the synthesis
of cost-effective
membranes by maintaining proper grafting conditions.18,19 Various kinds of anion-exchange membranes (AEM) have also been employed
as they show low vanadium ion permeability because of the Donnan exclusion/charge
repulsion phenomenon.20,21 Although AEMs show good resistance
toward vanadium ion permeation, they face the problem of lower mobility
of the SO42+/HSO4– ions through the membrane matrix than the H+ ions.21,22 Higher functional group-containing polymers also have inferior properties
like less mechanical stability because of the high degree of swelling
and more water uptake (WU). To synthesize a polymer electrolyte membrane
bearing improved characteristics, blending of acidic and basic polymers
is also a facile and easier way.23,24 By blending
both the groups, one can improve the mechanical, chemical, and electrochemical
stabilities by maintaining both the components in desired amounts.
Polyetherimide (PEI), which is a commercially available polymer, exhibits
good thermal, mechanical, and IC values.25 Blending of PEI with SPEEK would result in the synthesis of an acid–base
membrane in which the sulfonic group of SPEEK acts as an acidic site,
whereas the nitrogen-containing group acts as a basic site. One more
important thing observed is the hydrogen-bond formation between the
hydroxyl groups of SPEEK and the amine group of PEI, which results
in a cross-linking phenomenon, because of which swelling could be
controlled. Likewise, amphoteric ion-exchange membranes (AIEMs) containing
both cationic and anionic sites are generating huge attention toward
VRBFs.25 The controllability in the composition
of both anionic and cationic functional groups is possible in AIEMs,
which can be extended for wide applications.26,27

Herein, we have developed semi-interpenetrated network (SPIN)
type
of AIEMs based on the cationic site of sodium-p-styrene
sulfonate and anionic site in the form of vinyl benzyl chloride (VBC).
Quaternization of the synthesized membranes was achieved through the
reaction with three different kinds of aminating agents. The membranes
were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
to confirm their molecular structure and functional groups. Important
physicochemical characterizations like WU, ion-exchange capacity (IEC),
linear expansion ratio (LER), and IC were measured to evaluate their
performance toward electrochemical processes. Charging–discharging
cycles were performed to estimate their suitability for VRFBs, and
their performances were examined with respect to current, voltage,
and energy efficiency (EE).

Experimental Section
Synthesis of Semi-Interpenetrating
AIEMs
Semi-interpenetrating
(SPIN)-type AIEMs were synthesized by dissolving poly vinyl chloride
(PVC) into cyclohexenone. After obtaining the transparent mixture
of PVC, predetermined amounts of styrene, sodium-p-styrene sulfonate, and VBC were added into the solution. Free-radical
copolymerization was carried out with the help of azobisisobutyronitrile
initiator at 80 °C for 7 h, and the color of the solution turned
into pale yellow from being transparent. This solution was then casted
on a clean glass plate with a doctor’s blade. After complete
drying, the membranes were peeled off and then subjected to quaternization
in three different quaternizing agents, viz iodomethane, trimethyl
amine, and n-methyl morpholine, and denoted as ZWMI,
ZWA, and ZWMO, respectively, as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation for the Synthesis
of AIEM by Different Quartenizing
Agents
Physicochemical Characterization
of AIEMs
To evaluate
the performance of the synthesized AIEMs, the membranes were physicochemically
characterized by means their IEC, both cation- and anion-exchange
groups, IC, WU, number of water molecules per ionic site (λ),
and dimensional changes. The details are given in the Supporting Information.

Chemical, Thermal, and
Mechanical Characterization of AIEMs
The synthesized CEMs
and AEMs were characterized functionally,
thermally, and mechanically using FTIR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis, and universal testing machine (UTM). The FTIR spectra of
the membranes are recorded using the KBr pellet method with a spectrum
GX series 49387 spectrometer in the frequency range 4000–400
cm–1. The stress–strain property of the membrane
samples (2.5 cm long, 0.5 cm width, and 0.15 mm thick) is determined
using a Zwick Roell Z 2.5 tester. The test Xpert II-V3.5 software
was used for the data analysis. The details are given in the Supporting Information.

VO2+ Permeation
Measurements of VRFB Single-Cell
Performance
To conduct VO2+ permeability measurements,
the membrane pieces of an effective area (7.06 cm2) were
sandwiched between two half-cells, one cell filled with 1.5 mol L–1 VOSO4 in 3.0 mol L–1 H2SO4 (40 mL) and the other cell filled with
a solution of 1.5 mol L–1 MgSO4 in 3.0
mol L–1 H2SO4 (40 mL). MgSO4 is used to balance the ionic strength and minimize the osmotic
pressure between the two solutions. The VO2+ ion permeability
in the second compartment was checked periodically by UV–vis
analysis and calculated by the following equation of Fick’s law28 1  where VB is the
volume of VO2+, CB is the VO2+ concentration in MgSO4 solution, t is time, A is the effective area of the membrane, L is the thickness of the membrane, P is
VO2+ permeability, and CA is
the initial concentration of VO2+ in the first compartment.

The charging and discharging characteristics of the VRFB cells
were determined with the prepared AIEMs membranes. The charging of
the cell was done at a current density of 116 mA/cm2. During
the whole process, a piece of membrane is sandwiched between two graphite
electrodes clamped with a bare copper wire and connected to a power
source. The testing membrane acts as a solid electrolyte separator
between the anodic and cathodic compartments. A two-channel peristaltic
pump was used to maintain the turbulent flow at a fixed flow rate.
Both the chambers were filled with 40 mL of 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4 solution. The VRB single-cell
performance was evaluated in terms of current efficiency (CE), calculated
by using the following equation29 2  where Cdis (discharging
capacity) and Cch (charging capacity)
can be calculated as 3   4  where Idis is
the current recorded during the discharging process and tdis is the time taken for the discharging process. Similarly, ICh is the current recorded during the charging
process and tCh is the time taken for
the charging process.

For the performance evaluation of a redox
flow battery, energy
efficiency (EE) was evaluated from the current efficiency (CE) and
voltage efficiency (VE), and was calculated by the following eq 5.. 5  

Results and Discussion
The functional characterization of
the synthesized AIEMs was carried
out by FTIR spectroscopy as shown in Figure 1. The peaks at 1237, 1465, and 1667 cm–1 arise because of the −C=C– stretching
found in the benzene ring of styrene, VBC, and sodium-p-styrene sulfonate. The occurrence of these peaks confirms the interpenetration
of the monomers into the PVC matrix. Another peak that arises at a
frequency of 2958 cm–1 is due to the stretching
vibration of the −C–H– bond of the aromatic ring.
An absorption peak at 1108 cm–1 confirms the presence
of the sulfonate group, whereas an absorption peak at 1667 cm–1 indicates the presence of −N–H stretching.
Another absorption peak at 2239 cm–1 is associated
to the stretching vibration of the −C–N– groups
of amines. All the characteristic peaks are present in the membrane,
revealing the presence of both the functional groups within the membranes.
The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images at different magnifications
were also taken to demonstrate the dense nature of the membranes,
as shown in Figure 2A–C. The cross-sectional image of ZWMO was recorded showing
the nonporous nature of the formed membrane. The proper integrity
of the monomers used for the preparation of AIEM can be easily demonstrated
here by observing the compactness, which in result provides the dense
nature. Figure 2D shows
the cross-sectional view of the ZWMI membrane which confirms the dense
nature of the membrane. Figure 2E shows the mapping of different elements present in the membrane
matrix by different colors. The presence of nitrogen and sulfur in
the membrane is shown in Figure 2F by different colors. Later on, the occurrence of
both the acidic and basic groups was confirmed by energy-dispersive
X-ray analysis.

ZWMI membrane (F).

The thermal and mechanical
characterizations of AIEMs were performed
by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), differential scanning calorimetry
(DSC), and UTM analysis. Figure 3 shows the thermomechanical stability of different
AIEMs by DMA. The modulus values for all the membranes were found
to be comparable to the reported membranes, and the modulus value
for ZWMO was found to be maximum among the membranes, which is 14%
higher than that of the ZWA membrane and 21% higher than that of the
ZWMI membrane. The temperature of tan δ also increases from
the ZWA membrane to the ZWMO membrane, which confirms the higher thermomechanical
stability of the composite membranes (Figure 3).30 The DSC analysis
measured the glass transition temperature of the AIEMs, as shown in Figure S-1. The Tg value calculated for the ZWA membrane was found to be 81.92 °C,
whereas it was 81.24 °C in the case of ZWMI membrane, which is
higher than that of PVC because of the interpenetrating network with
VBC.31 It is clear from the data that the
membranes maintain their thermal stability after functionalization.
The mechanical stability of all the prepared membranes was tested
at room temperature in dry state by UTM, and the results are shown
in Figure 4 and the
corresponding values are presented in Table 1. The ZWMO membrane showed the maximum value
of Young’s modulus, 14.66 MPa, whereas the others showed 11.33
and 5.5 MPa, respectively. This result can also be justified by the
WU value. ZWMO shows higher amounts of WU when compared with the rest
of the two membranes, and we know that the water absorbed by the membrane
is responsible for membrane swelling, thus providing support to the
membrane when placed under an external force, that is, stress. ZWMO
also showed the maximum value for strain, that is, 3.60%, whereas
the lowest value is shown by ZWA, which is 2.26. This may be due to
the internal cross-linking between the functional groups and the polymer
matrix, which acts as a barrier for WU. Less WU and high degree of
cross-linking do not allow the membrane to elongate when force is
applied on it.32

The kinetics
of WU play an important role in ion-exchange membranes.
The WU of AIEM was measured gravimetrically by equilibrating the membranes
in water. The WU in AIEMs varied from 15 to 21%. The water molecule
per functional group (water content/hydration number) λ was
calculated using the following equation33 6  

The λ value for the ZWMI membrane is calculated to be
4.54,
which is enhanced by 7.4 and 20% for the ZWA and ZWMO membranes, respectively
(Table 2). The enhancement
of the hydration number in the ZWA and ZWMO membranes may be due to
the presence of a higher number of functional groups present in the
membrane. Transportation of ions in the membrane is carried out by
absorbed water.34,35 WU by a membrane up to an extent
is good for ion transport and stability, but high amounts will cause
diminishment in mechanical stability.36 The anion-exchange capacity (AEC) and cation-exchange capacity (CEC)
for the prepared AIEMs that were found to be maximum for the ZWMO
membrane are 1.11 and 0.62 mequiv/g, respectively, which slightly
differ from the theoretical IEC values, and can be explained by the
formation of ionic knots between both the acidic and basic groups.
The occurrence of intrinsic electrostatic force of attraction between
these two functional groups will provide no free exchangeable ion,
which results in slightly lower values of IEC. The difference must
be related to the effective degree of quaternization of the aminating
agent used. ZWMI and ZWO AIEMs also show good values for AEC and CEC,
as shown in Table 2. WU, LER, and IEC of the membrane are related with each other. IEC
is dependent upon the presence of the functional group in the membrane
matrix; as the functional group increases, IEC also increases with
WU. Table 2 shows the
WU and LER % in AIEMs, and it is clear from the data that as WU increases
LER also increases. The existence of both acidic and basic groups
within a common polymer chain shows a self-cross-linking behavior
because of the establishment of hydrogen bonding between two atoms
having different electronegativities. Because of this, one of the
functional groups, either acidic or basic, gets inhibited by the other.
In summary, we can say the protection of one by the other results
in a lower value of the ion-exchange capacity.

(λ), and Activation Energy of Membranes

ZWMO	1.11	0.62	21	19	3.12	5.49	22.94	
IC of AIEMs was measured for each membrane from 30
to 90 °C
by Nyquist plots to check their performance for high-temperature applications,
and the corresponding values are presented in Figure 5 and Table 2. The IC values for AIEMs were calculated to be from
1.84 × 10–2 to 3.12 × 10–2 S cm–1. The enhancement in IC was also recorded
for all the three membranes by enhancing the temperature from 30 to
80 °C. The enhancement in IC with temperature may be due to the
higher mobility of ions and proton and higher proton diffusion coefficient
at higher temperatures.37,38 The activation energy
for the conduction of proton/ions reveals the minimum energy required
for the proton/ion transport from a functional group to another and
is, therefore, an important parameter of IEM. Temperature-dependent
IC is used to determine the activation energy for proton/ion conduction.
The Arrhenius-type plots shown in Figure 5 are used to calculate the activation energies
for AIEMs.39,40Table 2 shows that among the activation energies
for AIEMs, the ZWMO membrane has the lowest value than the other membranes.

plots for different AIEMs.

The crossover of vanadium ions has become a very crucial
problem
for VRFB, as it causes several electrochemical energy losses and increases
the rate of self-discharge. Therefore, the vanadium ion crossover
resistance across the membrane has been measured. The diffusion of
vanadium ions is calculated by taking a sample from the model solution
of MgSO4 after a certain interval of time. It is clear
from Table 3 that the
vanadium crossover through the prepared AIEMs is very low as compared
to that through the Nafion 117 membrane. For ZWMO, the value of diffusion
coefficient is 4.97 × 10–8 cm2 s–1, which is about 15% of that of Nafion 117 (3.57 ×
10–7 cm2 s–1). The
reason behind this much lower value for the diffusion coefficient
for AIEMs could be the Donnan exclusion phenomenon.41,42 Because of this effect, the cationic functional groups which are
present within the polymer matrix prevent the VO2+ ion
permeation by static charge repulsion. However, for ZWA and ZWMI,
the VO2+ ion crossover value is slightly greater than that
of ZWMO; this may be due to the lower amount of WU, which in turn
makes AIEMs more favorable toward acid uptake, providing a medium
for VO2+ ion movement.

Nafion	87.78	89.43	
All the prepared AIEMs are chosen for VRFB application, and the
performances are compared with the benchmark Nafion 117 membrane.
The charging of all the prepared AIEMs is performed at a constant
current density of 116 mA/cm2 for 4 h. The discharging
voltage and current values were recorded manually by applying a constant
resistance of 1 kΩ for all AIEMs. The charging and discharging
characteristics of all the membranes are shown in Figures 6 and 7, respectively. However the charging voltage is slightly higher for
the Nafion membrane because of its excellent proton conduction and
lower area resistance, but the discharge capacity for AIEMs is greater
than that for Nafion, as shown in Figure 6. This could be due to the lower diffusion
coefficient of VO2+ ions across AIEMs compared to that
of the Nafion, as shown in Table 3. The VE values for all the membranes calculated during
the charging and discharging processes of VRFB are found to be 87.05,
86.62, 84.51, and 87.78% for the ZWA, ZWMI, ZWMO, and Nafion membranes,
respectively. The values of CE % for all the membranes calculated
during the charging and discharging processes of VRFB were found to
be 91.30, 90.50, 89.83, and 89.43% for the ZWA, ZWMI, ZWMO, and Nafion
117 membranes, respectively as shown in Table 4. Nafion 117 possesses good proton conductivity
and hence bears high VE (Figure 8). However, here, the reason for the low CE in the
charging phenomenon at high current density is the high polarization
of the cell at the high current density (Figure 8). The higher values of CE and VE in case
of AIEMs are due to the reduction in the cross-mixing of the redox
pairs in the anolyte and catholyte, respectively, because of the Donnan
exclusion phenomenon and lower WU.

different AIEMs at a constant current density.

Figure 8 EE vs number of cycles with different AIEMs.
Inset shows the CE
vs number of cycles and VE vs number of cycles with different AIEMs.

Further, the discharge capacity
retention of AIEMs was also tested
after 10 repeated cycles, and the performances were evaluated in terms
of EE, CE, and VE. It was observed that the decay rate for AIEMs is
slower than that for Nafion. This is also again attributed to the
resistance for the permeability of vanadium ions. ZWMO displays better
consistency, which is 91.51%, whereas it is 86.54% for Nafion 117
after 10 cycles (Figure S-3). This kind
of behavior of the prepared AIEMs delivers decisive capability toward
VRB to convert chemical energy into electrical energy. This low-cost
and ecofriendly method brings out a novel synthesis of AIEMs bearing
stable EE, VE, and CE, which, when applied in VRFBs, offers an alternate
of Nafion 117 substitution.43

The acid and VO2+ ion stabilities of the AIEMs
were
also tested for the application of membranes in VRFBs . To check the
acid stability of the synthesized AIEMs, the pieces of 2 × 2
cm2 area were soaked in 5 M H2SO4 solution for 10 days, and the physicochemical properties were compared
with that of the untreated membranes (Table 5). It is clear from Table 5 that a slight reduction in IC (2%), IEC
(2%), and weight of membranes is subjected to the degradation in the
functional groups (quaternary amine and sodium salt of sulfonic acid),
but no degradation in the main chain was observed. A loss in weight
of 1% was noted, which is smaller than that of the respective IC and
IEC values, which also reveals the sustainability of the polymer backbone.
An electrolytic solution of vanadium ions generally tries to degrade
the polymers which bear hydrocarbon chains because of its strong oxidizing
nature. It is better to check the stability of membranes by the conventional
cycling method. However, for this, a whole setup is required, which
is time-consuming. The second method to check the stability and durability
is the soaking test in which membranes are immersed for a long interval
of time into a predetermined concentration of the vanadium electrolytic
solution, that is, 1.5 M VOSO4 in 3 M H2SO4. The stability of the prepared membrane was tested for 10
days, in which no remarkable change either in the morphology or stability
was noticed. The physiochemical parameters show a minimal change with
no color change in the membranes (Table 5).

Conclusions
Cross-linked semi-interpenetrating (SPIN)-type
AIEMs were synthesized
successfully by inserting hydrophilic groups in the form of sodium-p-styrene sulfonate and VBC into a rigid PVC backbone. The
prepared AIEMs show relatively low IEC values than the theoretical
IEC values because of the formation of ionic knots between the acidic
and basic groups. The membranes exhibit good IC as well as mechanical
and chemical stabilities. The prepared membranes were applied in VRFBs
and compared with the state-of-the-art commercially available Nafion
117 membrane, whereas their performance was recorded in terms of VE
% and CE %. The ZWMO membrane shows 87.05% VE and 91.30% CE. It shows
the CR % value of 91.33%, which is higher than that of the Nafion
117 membrane. Methanol crossover resistance across the membrane was
also performed. The ZWMO membrane shows the lowest methanol permeability
value of 2.97 × 10–7 cm2 s–1 and selectivity of 2.43 × 105. The results suggest
that the SPIN-type AIEMs can be a good candidate for applications
in redox flow batteries and other energy devices.
