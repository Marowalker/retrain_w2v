Premature water production is an inevitable issue that
results
in loss of quantities of reserves in heterogeneous oilfields especially
with large permeability ratios. Hydrogel treatments, preferentially
plugging large channels, are efficient techniques to reduce excessive
water circulation. In this work, a moderate delayed polyacrylamide
hydrogel was fabricated applying in-depth plugging to promote oil
production. Suitability tests of delayed hydrogel in the presence
of quartz sand confirmed its mature delay over 10 days, providing
the low-viscosity gelant sufficient time for entering the deep layer.
Single sand-pack displacement tests demonstrated the excellent plugging
ability in differential permeability layers to strongly promote the
follow-up oil production. Aiming at heterogeneous reservoirs with
three different permeability ratios, conventional displacements and
hydrogel treatments were sequentially conducted. In comparison with
water- and polymer-flooding that mainly performed exploitation at
low-permeability-contrast layers (Khigh/Klow = 3), the delayed hydrogel technique
after polymer-flooding was capable of improving the oil recovery efficiency
of unswept zones at high-permeability-contrast zones (Khigh/Klow ≥ 10). Recovery
in heterogeneous layers with permeability ratios (Khigh/Klow) of 10 and 15 was
enhanced to 48 and 59%, respectively from 18 and 0%. In addition,
rheological behaviors and morphologies elucidated the delayed hydrogel
with extruding deformation and high yield strength, facilitating water
shutoff and improvement of oil production.

==== Body
Introduction
Excessive water production earlier in
heterogeneous reservoirs
often led to unproductive cycling of injected enhanced oil recovery
(EOR) chemicals, whereas large amounts of residual oil remained in
subterranean region.1−5 Long-term chase flooding always enters large permeability layers,
leaving otherwise low permeability zones unswept or poorly swept.6−8 Most oilfields were discovered in continental sedimentary basins,
which were characterized by complicated oilfield geologies having
high-permeability contrasts.9 To enlarge
the sweeping area, plugging agents were required to be injected into
the depth of the formation to block large channels so that the subsequent
fluids get diverted to the previously unswept oil-rich layers.10,11 Gel treatment is one of the most cost-effective techniques for water
shutoff and sweeping improvement.

Varieties of hydrogels have
been studied for oil recovery.12−22 Many studies enhanced recovery through particle gel16,18,19,21 or microgel20 technology corresponding
to the oilfield geometry. Surfactants combining with gels12,16 were utilized for improving the recovery efficiency. Even the porous
medium was controlled by promoting the sealant strength to reduce
heterogeneity13,14,17 or by treating special geological configurations.15 Among these technologies, polyacrylamide gels were extensively
used for managing the water yield.23−31 Nano particles such as clay,23 montmorillonite,24 and cellulose32 were
chosen to improve the strength of hydrogels for EOR. Particle gels,33,34 directly or through re-cross-linking, were injected into the large
channels acting as plugging agents. Active microorganisms were immobilized
into the polymer gels, which help to improve oil recovery through
metabolizing carbonate and bioactive components of surfactants or
ammonium.31,32 However, most of these hydrogels were hardly
applied in displacement practice or in oil recovery. Although a few
of them were evaluated in simple core-flooding operations,25,27−34 conventional gels always formed plugging in the immediate vicinity
of the wellbore, leading to chase water detouring to the far untreated
high permeability zones.35−37 Therefore, delayed hydrogel treatment
was further prompted for deep plugging. Delayed cross-linking can
be adjusted through cross-linkers, ligands that form complexes with
host cross-linkers, or slow-release synthesis. One possible way was
reported38 using strong ligands such as
malonate or glycolate to associate with Cr(III), and a delay occurred
till the binding construction of the ligand with the crosslinker.
Cordova et al.39 used polyethylenimine
(PEI) and dextran sulfate (DS) to entrap and control the release of
Cr(III) in polymer–Cr(III) fabrication, however, the delay
strongly relied on the pH, ionic strength, and temperature. As a primary
release-controlled agent, DS was too expensive to be widely used in
oilfields. Jayakumar and Lane40 chose 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane
sulfonic acid41 as a high-temperature delayed
source substituting DS to combine with PEI achieving several days
delay at 100 °C. However, the gelation at low temperature is
uncertain because PEI was mainly applied at medium and high temperatures.42−44 Xu45 designed a delayed gel based on
the slow release of methenamine, phenol, and citric acid cross-linkers
from the cavity of β-cyclodextrin, and the release highly depended
on the hydrophobicity of the competitive long-chain fatty alcohol
in hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) solutions. Thus, a cost-effective
and easily fabricated delayed hydrogel was extremely needed for deep
plugging.

In this study, partially hydrolyzed PAM (HPAM) with
a moderate
hydrolysis degree of 5% was utilized to form coordination cross-linking
with Cr(III) acetate through intermediate complexes46 to prolong gelation, and the resulting system exhibited
over 10 days delay, which is beneficial to function in-depth plugging.
The viscosity, yield stress, and morphology of the delayed hydrogel
were studied to examine the deformation, migration, and extruding
behaviors. Suitability and corresponding plugging performance in quartz
sand were verified through static gelling and single-sand-pack displacement
tests. Furthermore, double-core tests displayed how to increase the
sweeping efficiency of the delayed hydrogel and HPAM in heterogeneous
layers with low-, medium-, and high-permeability ratios (≥10).
The distinctions and advantages of the delayed hydrogel treatment
at differential heterogeneity were presented.

Results and Discussion
Rheological Behaviors of Polymer Hydrogels
The rheological
behaviors of HPAM and hydrogels were analyzed to inspect the viscoelastic
extrusion during oil extraction. For HPAM, both elastic (G′) and viscous moduli (G″) increased
with an increasing shear frequency, as shown in Figure 1a. G″ increased from
10–3 to 3.1 Pa as the shear frequency increased
to 10 Hz. G″ was always larger than G′, revealing a viscous shear-thickening fluid. Exhibiting
a low yield stress of 1.1 Pa (Figure 1b), HPAM was easily induced to flow once the external
stress was above 1.1 Pa, which would effectively decrease the mobility
ratio between oil and water for polymer-flooding because of its high
mobility. As a result, polymer-flooding enlarged the sweeping area
of the targeted reservoir after suffering from unproductive cycling
of water displacements. As for hydrogels, G′
and G″ were 103 to 105 times larger than those of HPAM, and G′
was always larger than G″, indicating an elastic
fluid of hydrogels, which showed distinct differences from HPAM (Figure 1a). As shear frequency
increased, G′ increased to 1100 Pa, demonstrating
the extraordinary elasticity of the hydrogel. While suffering from
shear, hydrogels sustained a high elastic deformation. Besides displaying
a high yield stress of 101.9 Pa, the hydrogel cannot be driven until
the stress was increased above 101.9 Pa (Figure 1b). Once the hydrogel is formed in the porous
channel, it is too difficult to be extruded out. The behaviors indicated
that the hydrogel is a reliable plugging agent for reducing excessive
water production.

Suitability of a PAM Hydrogel to a Heterogeneous Permeability
Layer
To evaluate suitability of the as-prepared gelant with
quartz sand, static gelation blending with 100 mesh quartz sand in
a ratio of 3:1 was conducted at 45 °C. Figure 2a compares the states of quartz sand before
and after gelling. Before that, all the quartz sand that dispersed
in the low-viscous gelant dropped off because of gravity once the
beaker was inverted (on the left in Figure 2a). After 10 days of gelling under 45 °C,
the gelant gelatinized. No quartz sand dropped but was suspended stably
at the bottom (on the right in Figure 2a). Unlike the complete dispersion initially, the sand
was binding together with the viscous hydrogel. Also, the gelation
time almost kept constant even though blending with sand, suggesting
little static adsorption quartz sand with the gelant. Additionally,
mixing with quartz sand, the hydrogel maintained thermal stability
at 45 °C for several months and even longer. The results illustrated
the excellent suitability of the hydrogel with quartz sand that constituted
the sand-pack models.

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of quartz sand before and after gelling
(left: no
gelling; right: gelling), (b) pressure curves of three different single
sand-pack model tests during the entire displacement phrase (A: first
water flooding, B: polymer flooding, C: second water flooding, D:
delayed hydrogel treatment, E: third water flooding; and F: fourth
water flooding).

Figure 2b compares
the displacement pressures of three different permeability sand-pack
models. After the first water-flooding for permeability measurement,
0.5 PV slug of 1000 mg/L polymer acting as a profile control agent
was injected. The injection pressures during polymer-flooding increased
and varied distinctly among the three sand packs. For a low permeability
model of 0.6 μm2, the pressure increased to 275 kPa
from 11.3 kPa. The pressure of the permeability model of 2 μm2 increased to 38 kPa. With regard to the high permeability
of 4 μm2, the pressure was merely 3.5 kPa during
the polymer injection of 0.5 PV slug. This comparison indicated that
the polymer performed an excellent profile modification in the low
permeability model. After the second water-flooding, a slug gelant
of 0.7 PV was injected, respectively. The third water-flooding was
run to drive the gelant to the depth of the models. Following that,
the models were under 45 °C for gelling. Until complete gelation,
the fourth water-flooding was conducted to investigate the plugging
effect in different permeability models. Figure 2b shows that three curves increased sharply
to maximum pressures, suggesting the block of large channels. Through
hydrogel treatment, as shown in Table 1, the residual resistance factor (RRF) of low, medium,
and high permeability models were 400, 80, and 32, respectively; this
is why the peak pressure of three different permeability models during
water-flooding achieved 1759, 1257, and 130 kPa. Obviously, the larger
the RRF, the higher the maximum displacement pressure. The chase water
was repelled to enter small unswept channels after high permeability
zones were plugged. Correspondingly, the permeability of the plugged
models decreased to 1.5, 25, and 125 μm2 from the
initial 600, 2000, and 4000, indicating favorable plugging. The single
sand-pack displacement results strongly supported that the gelant
can well-adapt to achieve efficient plugging in differential permeability
models.

Morphology of HPAM and Hydrogels
PAM polymer acting
as profile modification agent could increase the mobility ratio between
chase water and crude oil, thus to enlarge the sweeping area, but
it seldom exerts positive control in high permeability zone. Fortunately,
the robust delayed hydrogel could block large paths to improve sweeping
efficiency. These two distinct effects may be closely related to their
morphology. As shown in Figure 3, HPAM revealed a regular sparse framework which overlapped
layer by layer. It seems that the framework was interwoven by means
of the entangled polymer that was mainly responsible for the network.
A large amount of transparent pores appeared with sizes ranging between
10 and 20 μm. The pores were nearly filled with flowing water
together with a loose framework and may determine the polymer having
high mobility for migration during polymer displacement. Also, the
polymer would be propelled easily by the chase fluid. By contrast,
the morphology of hydrogels exhibited solid frameworks, and no apparent
pores appeared. The structure beneath the surface was invisible owing
to the dense network. It appeared that the pores (Figure 3b in black) were filled with
aggregated bundles, which formed a robust structure, resulting in
higher strength than the polymer. The hydrogel could still hold the
function of plugging in the reservoir, though the chase water-flooding
was continuously carried out.

Enhanced Oil Recovery in Double-Core Displacement Tests
To investigate oil recovery efficiency of delayed hydrogel treatment
after polymer-flooding in heterogeneous reservoirs, double-core experiments
with three different permeability contrasts of 1:3, 1:10, and 1:15
were conducted to study the flooding pressure, fractional flows, and
enhanced oil recovery during displacement. The parameters of core
samples and oil recoveries at different stages are summarized in Table 2.

Permeability Ratio of 1:3
Parallel cores with a permeability
ratio of 0.3:0.9 μm2 were saturated with oil, the
viscosity of which was 9.8 mPa·s, as simulated in Figure 4A. Initial oil saturation (So) values of high and low permeability cores
were 74.45 and 77.5%, respectively (Table 2). Displacement experiments underwent water-,
polymer-, second water-flooding, gelant-injection, and last water-flooding,
and the results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 5. The pressure curve fluctuated with various injecting fluids
and pore volumes, and it kept a low pressure of approximately 30 kPa
during the first water-flooding (Figure 5a). Fractional flow curves (black in Figure 5b) revealed that
over 95% water flowed into the high permeability core for sweeping
(Figure 4B), and the
oil recovery through water-flooding (Rw) was 52.42% (Table 2 and red in Figure 5c). Less than 5% of chase water entered the low permeability channel
(red in Figure 5b),
and the resulted Rw was merely 4%. As
a result, for heterogeneous reservoirs with a low permeability ratio,
sole water-flooding played a significant part in the high permeability
zone but resulted in extremely low Rw on
the low permeability layer because of high flowing resistance. Water
cut during the first water-flooding was up to 95% (red in Figure 5b). The 0.5 PV polymer
of 1000 mg/L was injected, followed by the second water-flooding.
Up to 40% polymer flowed into the low permeability core for displacing
the residual oil because of the increase in the mobility ratio. Therefore, Table 2 shows that Rpw in the low permeability core increased to
49.64%, compared to Rpw of 18.6% in the
high zone. The comparison indicated that polymer functioned excellent
as profile modification in heterogeneous reservoirs with a low contrast
coefficient of 1:3. Later, the chase water gradually detoured to the
high permeability zone. When the water cutting increased, a gelant
slug of 0.5 PV was injected. The parallel core was kept gelling under
45 °C for 12 days. Following this, third water-flooding was conducted
for oil recovery after hydrogel treatment (Figure 4C). Figure 5a shows that the pressure sharply increased to 2500
kPa during the process of gelant injection, and the subsequent sweeping
pressure also increased to 2300 kPa, suggesting the reasonable injection
of gelant and formation of the hydrogel. As shown in the fractional
flow curves, more than 90% of the chase water entered the low permeability
core (red in Figure 5b), confirming the plugging of the delayed hydrogel in the high permeability
zone. As a result, partial residual oil left in the low and high permeability
zones were further recovered, and RGw was
20.82 and 14.34%, respectively. Undoubtedly, owing to low resistance,
the injected gelant preferentially entered and plugged the high permeability
core, so that the chase water was able to displace the abundant residual
oil in low permeability (Figure 4D). The water cutting decreased by 35% because of the
hydrogel technique (Figure 5c).

water-flooding, D: gelant injection and gelation, and E: third water-flooding).

Permeability Contrast of 1:10
To further investigate
the plugging capacity of the hydrogel especially after polymer-flooding,
a parallel core with a medium permeability ratio of 0.3:3.0 μm2 was utilized for displacement tests. Oil recovery of the
first water-flooding (Rw) in the low permeability
core was 6.01% compared to high Rw of
48.91% in the high permeability core. Evidently, large amounts of
chase water entered large channels of 3.0 μm2 (Figure 6b). For the following
injection of the polymer, the pressure increased to 107 kPa (Figure 6a), much higher than
that of water-flooding, but lower than that of the same procedure
(378 kPa) in the low permeability ratio of 1:3 (Figure 5a). Fractional flowing improved little compared
to the initial water-flooding, and the chase water still kept flowing
into the large channels, which is significantly different from the
improvement after polymer injection in the low permeability ratio
layer of 1:3 where more water entered the low permeability layer (Figure 5b).

Figure 6 (a) Pressure curve as
the function of injection volume in the medium-permeability-ratio
double-core, (b) relationship between fractional flow and the injection
volume, (c) water cut and accumulative oil recovery vs the injection
volume. (A: first water-flooding, B: polymer-injection, C: second
water-flooding, D: gelant-injection and gelation, and E: third water-flooding).

As a result, Rpw in
the low permeability
core increased to 18.62% from 6.01% (Rw), which is much lower than the high efficiency of 49.64%, operated
in the low permeability ratio of 1:3. Contributing a higher oil recovery
than water-flooding, polymer-flooding functioned better at the low-permeability-ratio
layers of 1:3 over the medium of 1:10. To increase the recovery efficiency
in the low permeability core, hydrogel treatment was implemented.
A high water-flooding pressure of 2500 kPa after the hydrogel-treatment
is displayed in Figure 6a, and it is concluded that the hydrogel slug formed and plugged
the large channel. As observed from the fractional flow curve, 80%
chase water rapidly diverted the orientation to the low permeability
core (Figure 6b). Water
content significantly dropped to approximately 10% (Figure 6c), and oil recovery (RGw) in the low permeability core increased to
48.42%, compared to Rpw of 18.62%. Unlike
17.4% in the low permeability contrast of 1:3, the total EOR in the
medium permeability ratio of 1:10 was 33.19% (Table 2). The comparison distinctly indicated that
the delayed hydrogel technique conducted in the medium-permeability-ratio
heterogeneous layer had evident superiority over the zones with a
low-permeability-contrast, whereas polymer-flooding would improve
recovery efficiency at the low permeability ratio heterogeneous zone.

Permeability Contrast of 1:15
Parallel cores with a
large permeability ratio of 0.3:4.5 μm2 were utilized
to inspect the EOR efficiency of the delayed hydrogel treatment. Similar
to those at the low and medium permeability ratio cores, the pressure
in Figure 7a showed
an apparent increase in both processes of gelant injection and the
subsequent water-flooding. Clearly, 100% chase water entered into
the high permeability core before hydrogel-treatment (Figure 7b) with no chase fluid sweeping
the low permeability zone. Rw and Rpw in low permeability layers in Table 2 were both zero. Conventional
polymer-flooding was capable of improving the sweeping area, but it
did not function at all. Also, severe water circulation occurred,
and the water cut even reached 99% (Figure 7c). Because of the hydrogel treatment, the
fractional flow curve showed that over 90% chase water diverted to
the low permeability core, where the previously unswept residual oil
was displaced. Therefore, RGw in the low
permeability core increased to 59.9% (Table 2) compared to 10.9% in the high permeability
zone. Meanwhile, during the third water-flooding stage, the water
cut significantly decreased from 80 to 0% (Figure 7c), illustrating that the enriched oil left
in the low permeability zone was swept out. For the heterogeneous
zone with a large permeability ratio of 1:15, the oil recovery was
enhanced by 33.42% (Table 2) owing to the follow-up hydrogel treatment after polymer-flooding.

C: second water-flooding, D: gelant-injection and gelation, E: third

Further, RGw of the
low permeability
core with a ratio of 1:3 was much lower than that in both medium and
high contrasts of 1:10 and 1:15, confirming the outstanding profile
control and water shutoff of the delayed hydrogel in heterogeneous
reservoirs having medium and high permeability ratios.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the delayed cross-linked
PAM hydrogel technique
after polymer flooding displayed distinct advantages while applied
in heterogeneous reservoirs with large permeability ratios for EOR.
Based on the study, the major summaries can be drawn: (i) Cr(III)
established coordination cross-linking with HPAM resulting in delayed
gelation over 10 days, exhibiting excellent in-depth plugging to avoid
the detouring of the follow-up chase water. Suitability tests and
single sand-pack models proved the well-adaptation of the gelant to
achieve efficient profile modification for differential permeability
layers. (ii) PAM-delayed hydrogels possessed high viscoelasticity
and yield stress, being capable of sustaining shear and extrusion
deformation during migration for sweeping. Exhibiting a dense structural
framework, hydrogels provided a favorable elastic intensity for steady
plugging large channels. (iii) Parallel-core displacing tests supported
the fact that polymer-flooding functioned better as a profile modification
and oil-displacing agent for heterogeneous layers having low permeability
ratios, whereas for medium-permeability-contrast and large-permeability-contrast
(≥10) zones, delayed hydrogel treatment extracted far more
residual oil. The displacement models provided favorable guidance
for in situ industrial production in heterogeneous oilfields.

Experimental Section
Materials
Partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM)
AN905 with a molecular weight of 8 × 106 to 107 and a hydrolysis degree of 5% was purchased from SNF flocculant
(France), and chromium(III) acetate was purchased from Laize Chemicals
(China). Thiourea was provided from Oriental Chemicals (China). Crude
oil was obtained from Daqing Oilfield, China, with a viscosity of
9.8 mPa·s at 45 °C. The simulated aqueous solution with
a salinity of 5196.28 mg/L for gelant preparation was supplied from
Daqing Oilfield, and its general formula is given in Table 3.

Preparation of Polymer Hydrogel
PAM powder (0.5 g)
was slowly dissolved in the simulated aqueous solution under stirring
for 4 h to obtain a homogenous solution, and 0.5 mL of 10 wt % chromium(III)
acetate cross-linker and 0.4 mL of 5 wt % thiourea were added dropwise
into the previous suspension by stirring again for 30 min. The gelant
was well-prepared and further placed under 45 °C for gelling.
The polymer and cross-linker concentration was kept at 0.5 and 0.05
wt %, respectively.

Rheological Measurements
Rheological properties of
the hydrogels were performed using a German HAAKE RS600 rheometer.
Rheological behaviors of polymers and hydrogels were characterized
using a Z41-Ti coaxial cylinder and PP20 plate-to-plate geometry sensors,
respectively. The tests were first set in a stress oscillation scanning
model with a stress range of 1–100 Pa and a shear rate of 1
Hz to obtain a linear viscoelastic region, in which a fixed stress
of 4 Pa was ascertained. The subsequent viscoelasticity and yield
tests were executed as a function of frequency ranging from 0.01 to
10 Hz. The tests were all carried out at 45 °C.

Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy
Environmental
scanning electron microscopy was performed using a quanta 200F microscope
(American FEI) to observe morphologies of both HPAM and the hydrogel.
An annular gaseous secondary electron detector was subjected to a
vacuum degree of 267 Pa. Samples of 0.10 mL fluid or soybean-size
hydrogels were initially placed into the three cylindrical grooves
of a copper cylinder, which were further frozen to −60 °C
using liquid nitrogen. The copper cylinder loading samples were put
into the sample cell for vacuuming. Observations were performed along
with the slow sublimation of the icy samples.

Flow and Displacement Experiment
Single Sand-pack Plugging Tests
The single sand-pack
tests were conducted under a constant flow rate of 0.40 mL/min at
45 °C, while the water-flooding, polymer-flooding, and gelant
injection were operated in turns. During the entire operation, water-flooding
was initially completed to achieve a stable pressure, followed by
the injections of 0.5 PV polymer, the second chase water, 0.7 PV gelant,
and the third follow-up water. The final water injection was not performed
until the gelant completely gelatinized.

Double-Core Displacement Tests
Figure 8 shows the schematic device of the parallel
core flow tests as given in ref (9). The experiments were carried out at a constant flow rate
of 0.40 mL/min under 45 °C. Water-flooding was performed to measure
the permeability of the cores, and the cores were both saturated with
crude oil, followed by polymer, second water-flooding, gelant injection,
third water driven, and fourth water-flooding. The process of water
driven was run to impel the gelant to the depth of the cores. The
fourth water-flooding was conducted for oil recovery after hydrogel
treatment.
