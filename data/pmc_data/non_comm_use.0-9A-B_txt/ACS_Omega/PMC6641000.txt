Of the several electrochemical methods
for pollutant degradation,
the mediated electrooxidation (MEO) process is widely used. However,
the MEO process utilizes only one (anodic) compartment toward pollutant
degradation. To effectively utilize the full electrochemical cell,
an improved electrolytic cell producing both oxidant and reductant
mediators at their respective half-cells, which can be employed for
treating two pollutants simultaneously, was investigated. The cathodic
half-cell was studied first toward maximum [CoI(CN)5]4– (Co+) generation (21%) from
a [CoII(CN)6]3– precursor
by optimizing several experimental factors such as the electrolyte,
cathode material, and orientation of the Nafion324 membrane. The anodic
half-cell was optimized similarly for higher Co3(SO4)2 (Co3+) yields (41%) from a CoIISO4 precursor. The practical utility of the newly
developed full cell setup, combining the optimized cathodic half-cell
and optimized anodic half-cell, was demonstrated by electroscrubbing
experiments with simultaneous dichloromethane removal by Co+ via the mediated electroreduction process and phenol removal by
Co3+ via the MEO process, showing not only utilization
of the full electrochemical cell, but also degradation of two different
pollutants by the same applied current that was used in the conventional
cell to remove only one pollutant.

Introduction
Electrochemical mediators/electrocatalysts
play a pivotal role
in a variety of distinct fields, such as photoelectrocatalytic water-splitting
devices,1−3 fuel cells,4 aerobic redox
reactions,5,6 amperometric sensors and biosensors,7,8 and pollutant degradation.9−37 Electrochemical mediators/electrocatalysts operate by catalyzing
the desired electrochemical reaction by shuttling electrons between
the electrode and the substrate in solution, thereby exhibiting catalytic
onset at a comparatively low overpotential and, thus, improving the
energy efficiency. Ideally, the redox active mediators should be efficient,
long-lived, highly active, and inexpensive.

The degradation
of ubiquitous pollutants by mediated electrooxidation
(MEO) uses metal ion redox couples with a very high standard reduction
potential (e.g., Ag2+, Co3+, Ce4+, Mn3+) as mediators.9−29 The MEO is an outer-cell process in which the oxidized form of the
mediator is continuously fed into a pollutant-containing scrubber
column to effect the pollutant degradation, and the spent mediator
is electroregenerated again at the anode of a divided/undivided cell
in a closed cycle using paired electrolysis. The MEO has a wide range
of applications because the continuous regeneration of the active
component of the redox system in the electrochemical cell and its
recirculation through the scrubber column ensure its sustainable operation.
Indeed, the MEO is a United Nations Environmental Programme (UN-EP)-identified
process for the ambient temperature destruction of toxic organic pollutants
and waste streams, including persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
and dioxins, leading to their complete mineralization to CO2 and H2O in a shorter duration of time.9 Up to now, MEO-based processes have been used to successfully
accomplish complete mineralization of several hazardous organic industrial
wastes in water10−13 and also for the clean-up of noxious NOx and SO2 from flue gas mixtures.14−17 In our laboratory, we have tested
the MEO process for the last 10 years from small- to bench-scale and
later to pilot-scale stages with different metal ion mediators, such
as Ce4+, Ag2+, Co3+, etc., for the
complete mineralization of liquid organic wastes,18−21 destruction of noxious NOx and SO2 gases22−24 and H2S odor gas,25 and electrochemical incineration
of the gas phase volatile organic compounds (VOCs)26−29 in semibatch and continuous processes.

The cell for mediator generation in the MEO process is generally
a thin-layer flow-type electrochemical reactor with anode and cathode
compartments separated by a 0.15 mm thick proton conducting Nafion324
membrane. Mineral acids of high concentrations (5–10 M) are
used as the electrolyte, for example, HNO3 (for Ag2+/Ag+, Ce4+/Ce3+) or H2SO4 (for Co3+/Co2+). The
membrane is capable of allowing protons from the anodic to the cathodic
compartment to maintain the current flow but prevents anolyte and
catholyte mixing. In a Co3+/Co2+-based MEO system,
for example, with CoIISO4 present in the anolyte,
the Co3(SO4)2 (Co3+) mediator
is generated in the anode compartment, whereas proton reduction occurs
at the cathode. During these processes, one can see that the supplied
current for electrolysis is successfully utilized toward pollutant
degradation by way of mediator generation only in the anodic half-cell.
We believe that there exists a great scope for availing the benefit
of the full electrochemical cell if the cathodic reaction is tailor-made
toward the formation of a reductant mediator at the cathode in the
same cell, so that both the electrogenerated mediators can be used
to treat two pollutants at the same time with overall improved pollution
degradation efficiencies compared to those of the conventional cell
generating only one mediator for the degradation of only one pollutant
via the MEO process (see Figure 1). To the best of our searching efforts, we found no
published article addressing the production of two different mediators
effectively in the same divided electrolytic cell in a real flow-cell
operation for application toward pollutant abatement. Further, it
is surprising that there has been no published report on the mediated
electroreduction (MER)-based pollutant treatment in an external reactor
column integrated with the cathodic compartment of a direct electrolytic
cell for the regeneration of a reductant mediator, and, in a first
report on this aspect, we recently studied MER of gaseous CCl4 using a Ni+ mediator30 and MER of gaseous trichloroethylene by Co+ species.31

Figure 1 Conventional electrolytic cell upgraded to improve the
electrolytic
cell generating both Co+ and Co3+ mediators
for simultaneous degradation of two different organic pollutants via
MER and MEO processes, respectively.

Thus, the objective of the present work was to develop a
full cell
setup as outlined in Figure 1, with simultaneous generation of [CoI(CN)5]4– (Co+) from [CoII(CN)5]3– at the cathode and Co2(SO4)2 (Co3+) from CoIISO4 at the anode occurring in the divided cell, and to
demonstrate simultaneous degradation of two different pollutants utilizing
the electrogenerated Co+ and Co3+ mediators.
Cobalt precursors were chosen as model compounds due to their vast
applications in basic electrochemical studies31,36,37 and paired electrolysis processes.12,17,26,19 In the first phase of the work, the cathodic half-cell was studied
in detail to optimize the cathodic Co+ generation toward
its higher yield. This involved estimating the quantity of Co+ produced in the cathode chamber during constant current electrolysis
and investigating the influence of several experimental factors toward
maximizing its yield. The effect of different electrolytes and different
Co2+ precursors was studied, in addition to the effect
of different metal electrodes, such as Pt, Ag, Cu, Ti, as cathodes
because these metals are stable in an alkaline environment and are
good for reduction reaction.38,39 The orientation of
the Nafion membrane with its “+ marked” (SO3– groups exposed) side facing the anode or cathode
in the divided cell was also examined in improving the Co+ yield. Changes in the H3O+ ion concentration
in the electrolyzed catholyte and anolyte arising due to membrane
orientation were estimated from 1H NMR chemical shifts
as per the method reported by Murakhtina et al.40 Changes in the proton content of the electrolytes were
also confirmed by NIR spectral measurements.41 Subsequent to the efficient generation of the Co+ mediator
in the catholyte, the anodic half-cell was optimized toward maximum
generation of Co3+ from CoIISO4 oxidation
utilizing different anodes, such as Pt, mixed oxides RuO2/IrO2-coated Ti (DSA), and graphite. Following this, the
optimized cathodic and anodic half-cells were integrated into a full
cell to simultaneously produce Co+ and Co3+ at
their maximum rate at the cathode and anode, respectively, and flow-cell
experiments were conducted, in which electrogenerated Co+ was used to dechlorinate gaseous dichloromethane (DCM) via MER in
a scrubber column in a closed loop with the cathode compartment of
the cell, along with Co3+ used to mineralize gaseous phenol
via MEO in an another scrubber column integrated with the anode chamber
(electrolytes and mediators will not get exposed to the environments42). Through cyclic voltammetry, the electrocatalytic
activity of Co+ toward DCM reduction and that of Co3+ toward phenol oxidation were evaluated. The degradation
of DCM and phenol was monitored by gas chromatography (GC) analysis.

Results
and Discussion
Optimization of Cathodic Half-Cell toward
Higher Co+ Generation from Co2+ Reduction
In the most commonly
used Co3+ (Co2(SO4)2)
mediator-based MEO system with a divided cell for mediator generation,
CoIISO4 is used as the precursor (10 mM) in
the anolyte with aqueous H2SO4 acid (5 M) as
the electrolyte in both anodic and cathodic half-cells and Pt as the
anode and cathode. Co3+ is generated anodically from CoIISO4 (reaction 1), whereas the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs
from H2SO4 acid at the cathode (reaction 2). At the anode:
1   At the cathode:
2  In our first
attempt to produce a Co+ mediator at the cathode, the same
precursor salt, CoIISO4, was used in a 5 M H2SO4 catholyte,
and the electrolysis was carried out. Yet, H2 was evolved
and no Co+ was formed from CoIISO4. Although the HER is more facile when the proton concentration is
high, it occurs at more negative potentials in solutions of low H+ ion concentration as there is a shift of EH+/H2 by −60 mV per unit
increase of pH.43 With these considerations,
we speculated that a highly alkaline electrolyte as a catholyte could
provide the basis for CoIISO4 reduction to Co+ because by working in solutions of sufficiently high pH,
the CoIISO4 reduction generating Co+ species at the cathode should occur much before H2 evolution.
The results presented below validate this concept, and 10 M KOH was
used as the catholyte for further work. However, CoIISO4 could not be used as the precursor for Co+ generation
because of its low solubility in KOH due to the formation of a hydrated
CoII(OH)2 precipitate. From a thorough literature
survey, pentacyanocobalt(II) ([CoII(CN)5]3–) was chosen as the appropriate precursor for Co+ ([CoI(CN)5]4–) species
generation (reaction 3) because [CoI(CN)5]4– has
been reported44 to be soluble in KOH and
is a very strong reducing agent (E0 for
the [CoII(CN)5]3–/[CoI(CN)5]4– couple = −1.2
V (SCE) in 12 M KOH) with a pK of 18.44 3  Interestingly, using 10 mM [CoII(CN)5]3– in a 10 M KOH catholyte allowed
Co+ formation at the Pt cathode, and Figure 2 (dashed line) shows the amount of Co+ formed at different current densities (cd’s) as a
function of electrolysis time. Figure 2 (dashed line) shows that the Co+ yield
increased with the increase in the electrolyzing current; however,
measurable quantities of Co+ were formed at the Pt cathode
only at high cd’s (0.50 ± 0.03 mM after a 6 h electrolysis
at a cd of 50 mA cm–2). To check whether the Co+ yield could be enhanced, Ag was used as the cathode in the
next set of experiments. Interestingly, with the Ag cathode, the Co+ formation was significantly improved to 2.10 ± 0.11
mM after a 6 h electrolysis at 50 mA cm–2, as shown
in Figure 2 (solid
line).

rate = 100 mL min–1.

It is important to mention here that gas evolutions, although
of
less intensity, were observed at both the cathode (Ag) and the anode
(Pt) during electrolysis. These reactions could compete with the desired
electrode reactions and hence could cause power loss and reduce the
current efficiency (CE) of the mediator generation. The undesirable
gas evolution reaction at the cathode in KOH can be identified45,46 as water reduction releasing hydrogen gas and hydroxide ions (reaction 4). At the cathode:
4  In addition,
because the electrolytes contained
dissolved oxygen, two side reactions, that is, O2 reduction
to OH– (reaction 5) and/or H2O2 (HO2– in alkaline solutions) (reaction 6), could occur at the cathode in KOH as follows At the cathode:
5   6  At the anode,
the oxidation of H2O liberates oxygen gas and proton (reaction 7) At the anode:
7  The H+ ions so generated at the
anode would be driven to the catholyte electrostatically and also
due to the H3O+ ion concentration gradient between
the anolyte (5 M H2SO4) and catholyte (10 M
KOH). This facile, uninterrupted H3O+ ion transport
across the Nafion membrane, arranged as suggested by its manufacturer
with its “SO3– groups exposed”
side facing the anode (henceforth referred to as “NO”),
could drive and sustain the H2 and O2 evolution
reactions at the cathode (reaction 4) and the anode (reaction 7), respectively. An additional driving force for the
H2 and O2 evolution reactions was provided by
the fact that the high concentration of KOH in the cathodic part could
convert the exchanged H+ ions to water immediately. On
the basis of these considerations, we speculate that by arranging
the Nafion membrane such that its “SO3– groups exposed” side faces the cathode (intentionally reversed,
henceforth referred to as “RO”), the flow of H3O+ ions to the cathodic compartment could be diminished
to some extent so that fewer protons migrate to the cathodic chamber,
which, in turn, could slow down the gas evolution reactions, consequently
leading to an improved Co substance conversion efficiency. Indeed,
electrolysis data collected from the above cell arrangement with the
membrane in RO showed higher quantities of Co+ (2.64 ±
0.13 mM) compared with the smaller quantities of Co+ (2.10
± 0.11 mM) with the membrane in NO, as shown in Figure 3A, validating our above hypothesis.
Interestingly, matching with the above observation, changes in the
H3O+ ion concentration in the electrolyzed solutions
of the cathode and anode, arising due to the membrane orientation,
displayed a similar behavior, as shown below, and supported our suggestion
further.

[CoII(CN)5]3– containing a
10 M KOH catholyte at the Ag cathode with the Nafion membrane in different
arrangements, NO and RO. (B) Concentration of Co+ electrogenerated

Changes in the hydrogen ion concentration
in electrolyzed catholyte
and anolyte solutions with the Nafion membrane in two different orientations
were obtained from changes in 1H NMR chemical shifts of
H3O+ ions, as per the method reported by Murakhtina
et al.,40 which states that the 1H NMR chemical shift values are linearly correlated with the acid
concentration. The 1H NMR traces recorded for catholyte
and anolyte solutions before and after electrolysis with the Nafion
membrane in two different orientations are shown in Figure S1. The chemical shift values (δ), corrected
for the solvent water (δH2O = 4.778 ppm),
for different systems are summarized in Table 1. Change in the 1H NMR chemical
shift (Δδ) along with change in the hydrogen ion concentration
(ΔcH+), calculated from
(Δδ), are also included in Table 1. One can see from the ΔcH+ results that there was a small increase
in the H3O+ ion concentration after electrolysis
in the cathode chamber with the membrane in RO (ΔcH+ = +10.87 mM), compared with a large build-up
of H3O+ after electrolysis in the catholyte,
when the membrane was in NO (ΔcH+ = +57.97 mM), as expected. Expanding further, the accumulated
smaller proton concentration with the membrane in RO highlighted here
clearly indicates reduced flow of H3O+ from
the anolyte to the catholyte, resulting in enhanced mediator production,
as proposed earlier. For the accompanying proton concentration changes
in anolytes, see Table 1. In addition to 1H NMR studies, the NIR spectroscopic
technique was used for the identification of H3O+ ions (as H2O in KOH) because of its specificity to the
H2O concentration.41 The NIR
spectra obtained by subtracting spectral outputs before and after
electrolysis, monitored in the cathode compartment, for the membrane
in two different orientations are shown in Figure S2. The absorption peaks (Figure S2) close to the reported −O–H stretching and bending
vibrations (1456 and 1900 nm) indicate the presence −O–H
of hydronium ions,41 for the case of the
membrane in NO, suggesting facile migration of H3O+ ions to the cathodic compartment. In contrast, diminished
peak intensities (low H+ ion concentration) were found
for the membrane in RO, showing reduced migration of H3O+ ions into the cathode chamber.

It is important
to realize that the electrolytic cell with the
membrane in NO showed a cell voltage of 4.46 V, when operated at a
50 mA cm–2 current density. However, for the cell
with the membrane in RO, the cell voltage was higher at 4.92 V, under
similar operating conditions. Such an increase of the cell voltage
by 460 mV accompanying the membrane in RO could be a manifestation
of an increased ohmic drop across the membrane due to increased membrane
resistance arising due to decreased proton conduction from the anolyte
to catholyte. The Nafion324 resistance was analyzed by electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy under the galvanostatic mode, and the results
are presented in Figure S3. Through the
Nyquist diagram, the Nafion324 resistance at NO was found to be 88.9
Ω cm–2 (Figure S3, curve a), which is lower than 233.2 Ω cm–2 for Nafion324 in RO, clearly accounting for the proton diminution
to the catholyte.

Studies with Different Cathode Electrode
Materials for Co+ Generation
As the nature of
the electrode material
greatly influences the rates of redox reactions and often changes
the reaction path, product distribution, and the product yield in
several cases,45,46 we tested for the higher yields
of Co+ with various cathodes, such as, Ti and Cu. In all
of these measurements, the Nafion membrane was arranged in RO. Figure 3B shows that Ag appeared
to be the best cathode among the metals investigated in generating
higher quantities of Co+, with the Cu cathode showing the
least effect. Their ability increased in the order 8  The half-cell potentials (SCE) measured for
different cathodes were found to be −1.24 V for Ag, −1.05
V for Ti, and −0.28 V for Cu. Because of the fact that the
Cu cathode has a more positive potential than that required for reducing
the [CoII(CN)5]3– complex
(E0Co2+/Co+ = −1.2 V (SCE)), the Co+ formation could
be less than that by the Ag and Ti cathodes, as observed experimentally.
However, further detailed fundamental electrochemical studies are
needed to understand the electron transfer kinetics and mechanism,
and this is not the focus of the present work. As Ag was found to
generate higher quantities of the Co+ mediator ion, it
was used as the cathode of the optimized cathodic half-cell in the
integrated cell setup.

Optimization of Anodic Half-Cell toward Higher
Co3+ Yield from CoIISO4 Oxidation
Of the
four parameters that directly affect the Co3+ formation
at the anode, the effect of only two parameters, that is, membrane
orientation and type of anode material, was examined here because
the other two influencing factors, the electrolyte (H2SO4) and the Co2+ precursor (CoIISO4), were used as standard ones in several Co3+-based
MEO studies.17,26−29

Thus, the anodic half-cell
(10 mM CoIISO4 in a 5 M H2SO4 anolyte with a Pt anode) was studied for Co3+ generation
with the Nafion membrane in two different arrangements. Figure 4A shows that during a 6 h electrolysis
period the amount of Co3+ formed in the analyte of the
cell with the membrane in RO was significantly more compared to that
from the electrolytic cell with the membrane in NO. This particular
observation furnishes a strong and satisfactory evidence to support
our hypothesis that the membrane in RO could reduce the flow of H3O+ from the anolyte to the catholyte (Table 1), which in turn could
decrease the gas evolution reactions at both the electrodes and thus
could benefit the mediator production at the anode, as shown here
(Figure 4A), as well
as at the cathode, as illustrated previously (Figure 3A). Further, UV–visible analysis confirms
that the absence of migration of cobalt ions to the cathodic half-cell
during electrolysis with the membrane in NO (Figure S4, curve a) evidences that the decrease in the Co3+ concentration is not due to the crossover of cobalt ions.

RO arrangements. (B) Concentration of Co3+ electrogenerated
from 10 mM CoIISO4 containing a 5 M H2SO4 anolyte with the Nafion membrane in RO with different
anodes: (A) Pt; (B) DSA; (C) graphite. Current density = 50 mA cm–2.

Effect of Anode Electrode
Material on Co3+ Generation
Three different electrodes,
Pt, DSA, and graphite, were studied
as the anode to obtain higher quantities of Co3+ generated
at these electrodes. Figure 4B shows the electrolysis results: the IrO2 + RuO2-coated DSA (half-cell potential −0.01 V (SCE)) failed
to generate any Co3+, whereas both graphite (half-cell
potential 1.76 V (SCE)) and Pt (half-call potential 1.8 V (SCE)) anodes
produced net quantities of Co3+ with the Pt electrode showing
higher yields. The behavior of Pt evidences its well-known electrocatalytic
activity toward redox reactions.47 Marginal
Co3+ formation at graphite might be because of the electrode’s
poor stability because slow disintegration of graphite into the electrolyte
was observed during electrolysis. The lack of Co3+ generation-activity
of the oxide electrode is understandable because the electroactivity
of oxide electrodes is controlled by several factors such as specific
interaction of reactants with oxides, formation of higher oxidation
states of the central metal, composition of charged surface sites
governed by the coordination capacity of the metal present in the
lattice, and the solution pH.48 Because
of the higher quantities of Co3+ formation with Pt, it
was preferred and used as the anode of the optimized anodic half-cell
in the integrated cell setup.

Optimized Full Cell Setup
Finally, the optimized cathodic
half-cell (10 mM [CoII(CN)5]3– in 10 M KOH with a Ag cathode) and the optimized anodic half-cell
(10 mM CoIISO4 in a 5 M H2SO4 anolyte with a Pt anode) were combined into a full cell setup
with the Nafion membrane in the cell arranged in RO. Figure 5 illustrates the concentrations
of Co+ and Co3+ simultaneously produced at their
maximum rate at the cathode and anode, respectively, during continuous
electrolysis in such a combined cell.

Figure 5 Concentration of Co+ and Co3+ simultaneously

(10 mM CoIISO4 in a 5 M H2SO4 anolyte with a Pt anode). Nafion membrane in RO. Current
density = 50 mA cm–2.

The CE for the generation of reactive cobalt species was
estimated.
The CE for both Co+ and Co3+ formation decreased
with the electrolysis time during a 6 h electrolysis, as reported
for the formation of peroxomonophosphate at the BDD anode (1%)49 and ethane and ethene formation at the Ag cathode
(15%).50 The CE values for the formation
of both Co+ and Co3+ were higher, 21.5% (at
120 min), than around 1% reported for peroxomonophosphate formation
(Figure 3 of ref (49)). The energy consumption, calculated as energy spent (kWh) for 1
kg mediator production, showed: for the generating of 1 kg of Co+ at the cathode, more energy was required (ca. 154 kWh at
4 h) compared to 121 kWh for 1 kg of Co3+ at the anode
under the same experimental conditions.

Implications of the Present
Work in Pollutant Destruction: Coupled
MER and MEO Processes for Organic Pollutant Destruction in a Continuous
Process
Flow-cell experiments involving mediator generation
coupled with a scrubber column were conducted for pollutant degradation
using the optimized full cell setup described above. The experiments
involved simultaneous generation of Co+ at Ag and Co3+ at Pt for a certain amount of time, following which 75 ppm
of gaseous DCM to the cathode scrubber and 65 ppm of phenol to the
anode scrubber were injected at a gas flow rate of 0.5 L min–1, so that DCM was subjected to degradation by Co+ via
the MER process and phenol was subjected to simultaneous degradation
by Co3+ via the MEO process, with the electrolytic cell
continuously working for the sustained regeneration of mediator ions
Co+ and Co3+. During the entire course of electrolysis,
concentrations of Co+ and Co3+ were measured
continuously.

The electrogenerated Co+ mediator shows
99.25% removal of DCM (75 ppm) gas in 5 min, which was decreased to
70%, and then maintained up to 1 h studied (Figure 6, curve b). It should be noted that 40–50%
of gaseous DCM was removed in 5 min, which dropped to 0% removal efficiency
in 15 min when the solution was devoid of the electrogenerated mediator
(Figure 6, curve a)
or absorption, confirming that the DCM removal followed the MER process.
This is illustrated in Figure 6 (inset), which shows the concentration of Co+ in
the catholyte as a function of electrolysis time. When DCM (75 ppm)
was injected to the catholyte scrubber, it was spontaneously reduced
by the available electrogenerated Co+ species with a sudden
dip in the Co+ concentration from 1.8 to 0.3 mM, which
indicates that the MER process has occurred and the electrogenerated
Co+ has degraded the DCM. To evaluate the MER of DCM by
Co+, CV experiments were carried out and presented in Figure S5. DCM was not directly reduced on Ag
(curve b). Indeed, a strong adsorption of DCM on the Ag electrode
resulting in a decreased voltammetric charging current was displayed.
Note that 10 mM [CoII(CN)5]3– alone in KOH showed a peak at 0.92 V (Ag/AgCl) corresponding to
Co2+ reduction to Co+ (curve c). When DCM was
added to the [CoII(CN)5]3– containing KOH solution, there was a considerable increase in the
[CoII(CN)5]3– to Co+ reduction current (curve d) due to mediated45 reduction of DCM by the electrogenerated Co+, as shown
in Scheme 1. To identify
the reduction product, the electrolyte solution (before and after
DCM removal) was subjected to ATR–FTIR, and the subtracted
ATR–FTIR spectrum is depicted in Figure S6, wherein the resultant spectrum is well matched with ethanol
stretching frequencies C–O and OH and with the standard ethanol
spectrum from the instrument’s library. In addition, the electrochemical
reduction of DCM at the metal electrodes in aprotic solvents ended
up with higher molecular weight hydrocarbons such as propene, ethylene,
butane, etc., via carbene formation.51 At
the same time, DCM reduction in the aqueous medium produces methane.52 It is noteworthy that ethanol was identified
as the major product during the CCl4 reduction via MER
in a highly alkaline medium,30 and all
of these data highly support our results that the formed product is
ethanol (see Scheme 1).

M H2SO4; current density = 50 mA cm–2; electrolyte flow rate = 2 L min–1. Electroscrubbing
conditions: scrubbing solution flow rate = 3 L min–1; feed gas concentration = 75 ppm; gas flow rate = 0.5 L min–1. Inset figure shows Co+ concentration
variation when injecting DCM to the scrubber column.

Scheme 1 Possible Reaction Mechanism for the DCM Degradation
In the case of gaseous phenol
(65 ppm) oxidation by the electrogenerated
Co3+, the system showed 100% phenol removal immediately
and lasted for 1 h and beyond (Figure 7, curve b), which is additionally evidenced by the
associated Co3+ concentration variation, as shown in Figure 7 (inset). Upon injecting
65 ppm phenol, the Co3+ concentration decreased from 3.2
to 1.5 mM because most of the available Co3+ ions were
used up by the added phenol. The mechanism concerning phenol oxidation
by Co3+ is depicted in Scheme 2. The voltammogram for the corresponding
system (Pt anode at a 100 mV s–1 scan rate in a
5 M H2SO4 solution containing 50 ppm of phenol
and 10 mM CoIISO4 (Figure S7, curve d)) showed that the Co3+ electrogenerated
from CoIISO4 could effectively mediate45 phenol oxidation. On the basis of our previous
experience on solution-phase phenol oxidation,20,21 a separate study was carried out using a CO2 analyzer
to understand the product that was formed in phenol oxidation. Figure S8 (curve a) illustrates an increase in
the CO2 concentration (ppm) from 0 to 450 ppm instantaneously,
which is maintained for a while followed by a little increase after
1.5 h, confirming that the final product is CO2 (see Scheme 2). It is noteworthy
that the solution-phase phenol oxidation by electrogenerated Ce4+ and Ag2+ resulted in CO2 as the final
product. The reason for the mismatch in the exit CO2 concentration
and electrogenerated mediator Co3+ could be: slow mediation
kinetics at room temperature;20 higher
number of electrons (28) required for its complete mineralization;21 the reaction proceeding through several slowly
degrading intermediates,21 etc.

min–1; feed gas concentration = 65 ppm; gas flow
rate = 0.5 L min–1. Inset figure shows Co3+ concentration variation when injecting phenol to the scrubber column.

Scheme 2 Possible Reaction Mechanism for the
Phenol Degradation
Table 2 summarizes
the generation efficiencies of both Co+ and Co3+ mediators and the accompanying degradation efficiencies of both
DCM and phenol, achieved simultaneously from the above improved cell
setup. The table also includes the generation efficiency for the Co3+ mediator and the corresponding phenol degradation efficiency
from the conventional cell used in the MEO process (Figure 1). It is clear that with 25
mA/cm2 cd used for electrolysis, 35% Co3+ alone
was formed over a period of 200 min in the conventional cell. However,
interestingly, by integrating the active anolyte chamber with an active
catholyte chamber, as in the improved cell setup, 23% of the Co+ mediator was produced at the cathode in addition to the 35%
Co3+ at the anode with the same cd of 25 mA/cm2. This additional benefit is a key factor that indicates that unlike
the conventional cell, the improved electrolytic cell system utilizes
the maximum spent current for electrolysis (less that the quantity
used up by side reactions) toward pollutant degradation because this
later cell provides two mediators to treat two pollutants simultaneously. Table 2 also indicates that
the improved electrolytic cell ensured degradation of more than one
pollutant (DCM and phenol) with a removal efficiency of 70% for DCM
and 100% for phenol, which is a significant improvement over the conventional
cell used to generate only one mediator, which permitted removal of
one pollutant (phenol) by MEO with 100% degradation efficiency.

c In the conventional cell used in
the MEO process, the cathodic reaction at the Ag cathode in a 5 M

(see Figure 1).

Conclusions
In
summary, we have demonstrated that two mediators can be generated
in a single divided electrochemical cell by the same applied current
that is used to generate one mediator in a conventional cell. We have
shown that it is possible to generate high concentrations of scalable
mediators Co3+ (35%) and Co+ (23%) by employing
a highly acidic medium (5 M in anodic half-cell) and a basic medium
(10 M in cathodic half-cell), suitable mediator precursors (CoIISO4 in the anodic half-cell and [CoII(CN)5]3– in the cathodic half-cell),
suitable catalytic electrodes, along with the effect of proton transfer
by the Nafion membrane separator in a suitable configuration. Further,
the two electrochemically generated mediators were applied successfully
to remove two different gaseous pollutants, DCM (70%) and phenol (100%),
simultaneously via the MER and MEO processes. Pertinent issues, such
as screening of active mediators, especially for the MER process,
their stability under reaction conditions, the effect of the electrode
and electrolyte on the mediator generation reaction and mediator yields
of both the cathodic and anodic processes, and the mutual effect of
the cathode on the Co3+ yield at the anode and vice versa,
are to be investigated to promote the present process to a near-real
application level.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Cobalt Cyanide
Complex
The cobalt cyanide
complex ([CoII(CN)5]K3) was synthesized
as reported previously.53 Briefly, 161.3
g of potassium cyanide dissolved in 150 mL of water was added to a
cooled 160 mL solution of 120 g of CoII(NO3)2 under a nitrogen atmosphere (∼6.2 cyanides per cobalt)
and then an equal volume of chilled alcohol was added, and the resulting
mixture was slowly chilled until a mass of thin violet platelets appeared.
The obtained cobalt cyanide complex sample was filtered rapidly and
washed with cold alcohol and then dried in a vacuum desiccator and
stored in an air-tight brown bottle. Caution! Potassium cyanide
is highly toxic; proper care must be taken during handling.

Electrolytic Cell Setup
The electrolytic flow cell
used for the simultaneous generation of Co+ at the cathode
and Co3+ at the anode was of a plate-and-frame type, with
a narrow gap and divided configuration. A 0.2 L solution of CoIISO4 (10 mM) in 5 M sulfuric acid and 0.2 L of
[CoII(CN)5]3– (10 mM) in 10
M KOH were placed in separate anolyte and catholyte tanks, respectively.
The anolyte and catholyte solutions were continuously circulated through
the anode and cathode compartments of the electrochemical cell at
constant flow rates (100 mL min–1) using peristaltic
pumps (Masterflex - L/S, model No. 7524-45, Cole Parmer Instrument
Company) through a narrow gap of a divided cell (divided by the Nafion@324 membrane). The active Co+ and Co3+ mediators were generated galvanostatically by applying different
constant current densities between 10 and 50 mA cm–2 using a DC power supply (Korea Switching Instruments). The effective
surface area of each electrode exposed to the solution was 4 cm2. A mesh-type Cu and a perforated Ti plate were used as cathodes
in the cathodic half-cell optimization studies. Similarly, in the
anodic half-cell optimization, a mesh-type DSA and a perforated graphite
plate were used as anodes. The electrolysis setup is shown in Figure 1 as a schematic line
diagram with the major components mentioned. All of the measurements
were carried out in triplicate at 20 °C.

Electroscrubber Setup
A scrubber column, 40 cm high,
5.5 cm in internal diameter, and packed with 1 cm2 of Teflon
tubes as the packing material, was attached to the top of the each
electrolyte (anolyte and catholyte) tank for the phenol and DCM gas
degradation experiments.26,30 The gas samples were
collected from the scrubber outlet for GC analysis. The cell had cathode
and anode areas of 50 cm2 and an electrolyte volume of
500 mL. The electrolyte solutions were circulated continuously to
flow through the electrolytic cell at a constant flow rate of 2 L
min–1 using magnetic pumps. The scrubbing solution
(electrogenerated mediator-containing solution) was pumped separately
into the scrubber column at a flow rate of 3 L min–1. The phenol and DCM vapors were generated separately (used elsewhere)
in separate tanks by the N2 gas. The exit vapors were controlled
using mass flow controllers (MFCs; Line Tech., model M3030V R, Korea)
and then introduced to the bottom of the scrubber at a set gas flow
rate.

Estimation of Co+ and Co3+ Concentrations
Quantification of electrogenerated mediators was determined as
elsewhere.26,30 In brief, aliquots (5 mL) of
the catholyte containing Co+ were periodically drawn during
electrolysis, and the generated Co+ concentration was derived
by titrating it potentiometrically against a standard (FeIII)2(SO4)3 (1 mM) solution using an
oxidation reduction potential (ORP) electrode (model No. EMC 133 (6
mm of Pt with a Ag/AgCl reference electrode and a gel electrolyte,
Germany) with the help of a pH/ISE meter (iSTEK, pH-240L) to identify
the end point during the titration. During each titration, the addition
of (FeIII)2(SO4)3 was
stopped when the measured ORP, which shifted to negative values with
the increase in the Co+ concentration, was reverted back
to its initial value measured before electrolysis, −170 mV.
From the volume of Fe3+ consumed, the concentration of
Co+ was calculated. The concentrations were reproducible
to within ±5%.

In a similar manner, the Co3+ concentration from the anode compartment was obtained by titration
with FeIISO4 (1 mM). Here, the initial ORP of
the Co3+-containing solution, which was around 600 mV,
became increasingly positive with the increase in the Co3+ concentration. The concentration of Co3+ was calculated
from the FeIISO4 titrant volume.

Analyses
The catholyte and the anolyte samples from
the electrolytic cell were analyzed for their proton content, before
and after electrolysis, by 1H NMR and NIR spectroscopy.
The NMR analysis of the electrolyte samples was done using a high-resolution
NMR spectrometer (400 MHz, FT-NMR, Bruker, model: AVANCE 400, Germany)
without dilution. In all of the instrumental techniques, a similar
sampling procedure and analysis time was maintained. For NIR measurements,
3 mL of the sample solution was placed in a rotating cup (150 mm diameter)
with a Au lid covered, and the measurements were carried out in the
reflectance mode in a monochromator NIR instrument between 680 and
2500 nm at a 1 nm interval (Spectra Star, model: RTW-2240, Unity Scientific).
The solution-phase products ware analyzed by an attenuated total reflectance–FTIR
(ATR–FTIR, Thermo scientific, Nicolet iS5) using a 2 μL
drop of the reaction sample on the diamond prism.

The removal
efficiency was monitored by GC analysis using gas samples (0.5 μL)
that were withdrawn via a gas syringe (model 10R-GP-GT) from the exit
gas of the scrubber column after phenol oxidation or DCM reduction
and were analyzed by GC using an HP 6890. A porapak Q column (length
1.8 m × 2.1 mm diameter with 80–100 molecular sieve mesh
made by stainless steel tubing) was used for gas chromatographic separations
(Sigma-Aldrich). The GC oven temperature was set at 200 °C, and
the thermal conductivity detector temperature was fixed at 250 °C.
Helium was used as a carrier at a flow rate of 2 mL min–1. The migration of cobalt ions during electrolysis from the anodic
half-cell to the cathodic half-cell through Nafion324 was primarily
analyzed by UV–visible spectroscopy using a Scinco s-3100 spectrophotometer.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were carried out in a glass cell
furnished with two compartments separated by a membrane for working
and counter electrodes. A platinum mesh and a dip-type Ag/AgCl electrode
were used as counter and reference electrodes, respectively. Measurements
were done with a PARC VersaSTAT 3 instrument. A tailor-made Nafion
membrane divided cell was used for the impedance studies by using
the same PARC VersaSTAT 3 instrument. The galvanostatic mode with
an applied current of 1 mA (vs OCP) using a two-electrode configuration
was used with Pt as the counter and working electrodes (1 cm distance),
respectively, with the frequency range between 10 kHz and 0.01 Hz.
