Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
(PNIPAM) is an important
polymer with stimuli-responsive properties, making it suitable for
various uses. Phase behavior of the temperature-sensitive PNIPAM polymer
in the presence of four low-molecular weight additives tert-butylamine (t-BuAM), tert-butyl
alcohol (t-BuOH), tert-butyl methyl
ether (t-BuME), and tert-butyl methyl
ketone (t-BuMK) was studied in water (D2O) using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
and dynamic light scattering. Phase separation was thermodynamically
modeled as a two-state process which resulted in a simple curve which
can be used for fitting of NMR data and obtaining all important thermodynamic
parameters using simple formulas presented in this paper. The model
is based on a modified van’t Hoff equation. Phase separation
temperatures Tp and thermodynamic parameters
(enthalpy and entropy change) connected with the phase separation
of PNIPAM were obtained using this method. It was determined that Tp is dependent on additives in the following
order: Tp(t-BuAM) > Tp(t-BuOH) > Tp(t-BuME) > Tp(t-BuMK). Also, either increasing the additive
concentration
or increasing pKa of the additive leads
to depression of Tp. Time-resolved 1H NMR spin–spin relaxation experiments (T2) performed above the phase separation temperature of
PNIPAM revealed high colloidal stability of the phase-separated polymer
induced by the additives (relative to the neat PNIPAM/D2O system). Small quantities of selected suitable additives can be
used to optimize the properties of PNIPAM preparations including their
phase separation temperatures, colloidal stabilities, and morphologies,
thus improving the prospects for the application.

1 Introduction
Stimuli-responsive polymers,
also called “smart polymers”,
are a group of materials which are responsive to external stimuli
due to variations in their hydrophilic–hydrophobic characters.1−5 Temperature, solvents, salts, pH, electromagnetic radiation, chemical,
or biological agents are all potential stimuli which can trigger a
response,1,5−7 and there are also a
variety of responses, including conformational change, micelle formation,
dissolution/precipitation, or variations in optical or electrical
properties. Temperature-responsive polymers are well-known for their
unique property to undergo phase separation upon temperature decrease
(upper critical solution temperature behavior—UCST) or temperature
increase (lower critical solution temperature behavior—LCST).7−16 The phenomenon of phase separation is due to a coil–globule
transition, whereby the expanded coils of polymer chains undergo a
transition to compact polymer globules. At the molecular level, phase
separation in solutions is considered to be a macroscopic manifestation
of a coil–globule transition followed by further aggregation
and formation of colloidally stable mesoglobules.4,17,18 Phase separation is associated with variations
in the balance between several types of interactions, including hydrogen
bonds and hydrophobic interactions.4 Prolonging
the colloidal stability of phase-separated polymers is an important
issue in applications such as controlled release, drug delivery, bioseparation,
and diagnostics. It is still unclear, for some polymers, what is the
main driving force behind their high colloid stability in thermodynamically
unfavorable media.4

Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) is a well-known
temperature-responsive polymer with LCST at approximately 32 °C,19 close to human body temperature. This makes
PNIPAM-based systems interesting for various biomedical1,2,6,7,20−26 and technological8 applications. PNIPAM
and its copolymers have been widely studied by means of light-scattering
techniques,19,27 Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,3,28 refractometry,29 pressure perturbation
calorimetry,30 differential scanning calorimetry,31−33 isothermal titration calorimetry,34 and
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy.10,27,28,33,35,36 The presence of low-molecular
weight compounds such as salts37 or surfactants38 can shift the phase equilibrium of PNIPAM to
higher or lower temperatures. PNIPAM can also undergo phase separation
at a constant temperature by changing the ratio of two polar solvents
(e.g., water–methanol, water–ethanol, and water–tetrahydrofuran),
the so-called co-nonsolvency effect.15,39,40 These properties make PNIPAM attractive for various
applications.

In this work, we provide a comparative analysis
of the effects
of low-molecular weight hydrophobic additives on the phase separation
of PNIPAM. In particular, the behavior of PNIPAM in response to small
quantities of tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), tert-butylamine (t-BuAM), tert-butyl methyl ether (t-BuME), and tert-butyl methyl ketone (t-BuMK) additives
has been investigated (Figure 1). NMR spectroscopy was used as the main technique for the
analysis of the effects of additives on phase behavior with phase
separation being modeled as a two-state dynamical process. The NMR
data were rationalized in terms of a modified van’t Hoff equation
fitted to experimental data. This approach allows determination of
thermodynamic parameters such as the variations in enthalpy and entropy
associated with phase separation. 1H NMR spin–spin
relaxation experiments (T2) were used
to examine the molecular mobility of the additives and D2O solvent molecules. Spin–spin relaxation times T2 provide information about the colloidal stability of
phase-separated PNIPAM over time. The dynamic light scattering (DLS)
technique was used to determine the sizes of polymer globules formed
above the phase separation temperature.

Figure 1 Chemical structures of
temperature-sensitive PNIPAM and the additives
used in this study: tert-butylamine (t-BuAM), tert-butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), tert-butyl methyl ether (t-BuME), and tert-butyl methyl ketone (t-BuMK).

2 Results and Discussion
Examples of NMR spectra of PNIPAM (5 wt % in D2O) in
the presence of the additives studied (2 wt % in D2O) below
(22 °C) and above (∼41 °C) the phase separation temperature
are shown in Figure 2. The spectra clearly indicate that after phase separation, the resonances
due to PNIPAM (a, b, c, and d resonances in Figure 2) disappear. This effect is connected with
the low mobility of PNIPAM globular structures above phase separation.

Figure 2 1H NMR (600.2 MHz) of PNIPAM (wP = 5 wt
%, D2O) below (at 22 °C) and above
(at ca. 41 °C) the phase separation temperature in the presence
of wadditive = 2 wt % of additives: (a) t-BuAM, (b) t-BuOH, (c) t-BuME, and (d) t-BuMK. Resonance assignments of
PNIPAM and all additives are also shown for each case.

Figure 3a shows
the 1H NMR spectra measured during heating at small temperature
steps either side of the phase separation temperature. A gradual decrease
in the resonance intensity due to PNIPAM can be observed. To perform
the quantitative analyses of the phase separation, the value of the
phase-separated fraction of PNIPAM units p(T) was calculated using the following formula.10,41−43 1  where I0′(T0) is temperature-dependent integrated intensity of the NMR
resonance corresponding to polymers below the phase separation temperature
(usually determined at T0 = 20 °C).
The I′(T) is temperature-dependent
integrated intensity of the same resonance in the partly phase-separated
system (determined at T > 20 °C). The I0′(T0) and I′(T) values
are unaffected by the fundamental temperature dependence of integrated
intensities according to the Boltzmann equation. The Boltzmann equation
states that the integrated intensities are temperature-dependent and
decrease with absolute temperature as 1/T. This effect
is corrected in eq 1 using
the formulae I(T) = I′(T)/T and I0(T0) = I0′(T0)/T0,
where I(T) and I0(T0) are Boltzmann-uncorrected
integrated intensities as obtained from measurement of the partly
phase-separated system and prior to phase separation, respectively.
The “b” resonance corresponding to
the NCH group of PNIPAM (Figure 3a) was used for evaluation of the integrated intensities
and subsequent calculation of the phase-separated fraction. This yields
the right side of eq 1 used for data analysis at temperatures T ≥ T0, where T is the actual temperature
of measurement and T0 is the temperature
below phase separation of PNIPAM. The results obtained using this
method are plotted in Figure 3b (solid squares).

based on eq 6. Photos
of solutions below and above phase separation (irradiated by a green
laser pointer) are included.

To extract the thermodynamic parameters of the phase separation
of PNIPAM solutions from NMR data, we have used a simple model based
on two exchangeable states41 (Figure 4). State one consists
of polymer units in the coil form (a freely moving polymer chain).
The second consists of polymer units in the globular form (rather
compact rigid structures). The transition between these two states
(coil–globule transition) is described by an equilibrium constant K, which is defined as the ratio of separated Nseparated and separable (but not separated yet) Nseparable PNIPAM units. 2  

Figure 4 Schematic model
of phase separation of the PNIPAM polymer containing
three types of units used for the thermodynamic model.

This model also takes into account that some polymer
chains are
not separable and remain in a coil state even at high temperatures
(often attributed to the low molecular weight fractions of the polymer44), reflected by Ninseparable (i.e., number of inseparable PNIPAM units). The fraction of phase-separated
PNIPAM units p(T) is generally defined
in eq 3. 3  

The combination
of eqs 2 and 3 gives a formula for p(T) as a function of the equilibrium constant K 4  where pmax = (Nseparable + Nseparated)/(Nseparable + Ninseparable + Nseparated) is the
maximum fraction of PNIPAM phase separable units. The van’t
Hoff equation for the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant K is shown in eq 5. 5  where ΔH and ΔS are
the standard changes in enthalpy
and entropy, respectively, connected with phase separation of PNIPAM. R is the gas constant (8.314 J mol–1 K–1) and T is the absolute temperature.
Combining eqs 4 and 5 yields a final formula for p(T)41 6  Experimental data
for p(T) as shown in Figure 3b were fitted using eq 6 such that values of ΔH and
ΔS could be obtained. Another important parameter
is the temperature of the phase separation Tp, calculated as the onset temperature obtained from fitting
of the p(T) curve (see Figure 3b). The value of Tp is found at the intersection point of the
tangent at the inflexion point Ti of the p(T) curve and the x-axis.
The inflexion is at the point where the second derivative of p(T) is zero p″(T) = d2p(T)/dT2 = 0, resulting in the following eq 7 7  This
equation does not have analytical solution
in the closed form. Therefore, the numerical bisection method can
be used for the determination of the inflexion point Ti. However, a solution of excellent accuracy can be found
using an approximation. Equation 7 can be rearranged as eq 8. 8  where the term containing exponentials
corresponds
to the tanh function, subsequently approximated using the first term
of its Taylor expansion (i.e., tanh(x) ≈ x). This yields a quadratic equation for Ti, eq 9 9  whose solution has the form of eq 10. 10  

At this point, the Taylor expansion of the
square root up to the
second order term is used (i.e., ). After several rearrangements, a simple
formula for the temperature at the inflexion point Ti can be obtained. 11  

The condition for the intersection of the tangent line at
the inflexion
point and x-axis leads to an expression for the temperature
of phase separation Tp. 12  where p′(Ti)
denotes the first derivative of p(T) with respect to T evaluated at Ti. Using a similar approach, an equation for
the offset temperature Toff (Figure 3b) can be derived
from the intersection of the tangent line with line y = pmax. 13  

The offset temperature Toff indicates
the point at which phase separation is nearly complete. From Tp and Toff, the
width of the phase separation ΔTwidth (the difference between offset and onset temperatures; see Figure 3b) can be determined
using the following formula 14  

The fitting of experimental data using eq 6 yields values for ΔH, ΔS, and pmax. Thereafter, the parameters Tp and ΔTwidth can be determined
using eqs 12 and 14,
respectively. Error analysis indicates that these approximations introduce
only negligible errors into the values of Ti, Tp, Toff, and ΔTwidth obtained.a

Figure 5 shows p(T) as calculated
from NMR experimental
data for samples of PNIPAM (5 and 10 wt %) and all additives (5 wt
%). It can be seen that the phase separation temperature Tp decreases (for both PNIPAM concentrations), depending
on the additive, in the following order: no additive > t-BuAM > t-BuOH > t-BuME > t-BuMK.

Figure 5 Influence of additive types (wadditive = 5 wt %) on the phase-separated fraction p(T) of (a) wp = 5 wt % and (b) wp = 10 wt % of PNIPAM
as obtained from the NCH
resonance of PNIPAM. Key: Full/empty squares = experimental points,
full/dashed lines = fits according to eq 6.

Figure 6 shows plots
of the phase-separated fraction p(T) obtained from NMR data for all measured combinations of PNIPAM
(5 and 10 wt %) and additives (0, 2, 5, and 7 wt %). The data were
fitted using eq 6. All
relevant thermodynamic parameters (Tp,
ΔTwidth, pmax, ΔH, and ΔS) are graphically summarized in Figure 7. It can be seen that there are only small
differences in all studied parameters for 5 and 10 wt % of PNIPAM.
Increasing the content of any additive decreases the phase separation
temperature (Tp, Figure 7a,b), increases the width of phase separation
(ΔTwidth, Figure 7c,d), and decreases both enthalpy (ΔH, Figure 7g,h) and entropy change (ΔS, Figure 7i,j) connected with phase separation
of PNIPAM. The value of Tp depends on
the additive type and decreases in the following order (at constant wadditive): t-BuAM > t-BuOH > t-BuME > t-BuMK. t-BuMK has the greatest effect on Tp (decrease of ca. 10 °C), ΔTwidth, ΔH, and ΔS, which will be discussed in detail later. Values of pmax are close to 1 (within experimental error)
for all
additives (Figure 7e,f).

and (d) t-BuMK. Key: Full/empty squares = experimental

The additives can be ordered in
terms of relative hydrophobicity.
Using the values of partition coefficients, log P (given in brackets for each additive) estimated using HSPiP software45 gives the order from least to most hydrophobic
additives in the following sequence: t-BuAM (0.3)
> t-BuOH (0.5) > t-BuME (0.9)
> t-BuMK (1.2). From this perspective, the phase
separation
of PNIPAM is mostly affected by t-BuMK because of
its hydrophobic association with PNIPAM. This association leads to
the partial removal of water molecules from the vicinity of the polymer
chains. This effect lowers Tp and ΔH because less heat is required to break hydrogen bonds
between polymer chains and solvating water molecules.

Acidity/basicity
is another parameter characterizing these additives. Figure 8 is a plot of Tp as a function of pKa for
each additive and its weight fraction. It can be seen that higher
pKa (higher basicity) of the additive
lowers Tp. Also, larger content of the
same additive decreases the Tp value (vertical
gray arrows in Figure 8). This is again because of the higher basicity of the solution.
Therefore, pH of the aqueous solution significantly affects the phase
separation temperature of PNIPAM.

Figure 8 Plot of the phase separation temperature Tp (data from Figure 7a,b) as a function of pKa of additives
and its content (wadditive) for both 5
and 10 wt % of PNIPAM. The values of pKa correspond to nondeuterated additives: t-BuAM (pKa = 10.68),46t-BuOH (pKa = 16.54),47t-BuME (pKa = 16.89),48 and t-BuMK (pKa = 20.8).49 The value of pKa for neat D2O is set to 14 (same as H2O) for consistency with
additives. For clarity, there are slight offsets of additive pKa values for 5 and 10 wt % of PNIPAM. All values
of pKa (in H2O) can be converted
to pKa* (in D2O) using the approximate formula pKa* = 1.076 × pKa – 0.45.50 However, this corresponds practically to a ca.
+0.8 pKa unit shift (i.e., to more basic)
of the experimental points, and so it does not change the character
of the plot.

A series of time-resolved
spin–spin 1H NMR relaxation
experiments was performed in order to determine the mobilities of
water and additive molecules below and above the phase separation
temperature of PNIPAM (for wp = 5 wt %).
The values of spin–spin 1H NMR relaxation time T2 were acquired for residual HDO and also for
the t-butyl proton resonances of t-BuOH, t-BuME, and t-BuMK as shown
in Figure 9. T2 relaxation times above phase separation (T = 310 K = 37 °C) were significantly shorter than
those at the temperature (T = 286 K = 13 °C)
below separation for both HDO and t-butyl (CH3)3 groups. This shows that HDO molecules as well
as additive molecules exhibit a lower, spatially restricted mobility.
Contributions due to chemical exchange16 are also important because the mobility-restricted solvent molecules
are bound within mesoglobules and thus have a low T2 value. The overall T2 value
is the weighted harmonic mean of bound and free T2 values, resulting in low overall T2 above phase separation.51 The
sample was then kept in the NMR magnet at an elevated temperature
(T = 310 K = 37 °C), and the time dependence
of T2 was measured. After the value of T2 had reached a plateau, we observed no further
changes of T2 values over the course of
days (Figure 9a–f). T2 values remained relatively low (ca. 0.7 s
for HDO and ca. 0.2 s for t-butyl groups of additives),
indicating that the solvent molecules remain restricted in mobility
and bound in mesoglobular structures. This further indicates that
these systems are colloidally stable solutions, such that the phase-separated
particles do not aggregate and precipitate. This observation is in
contrast to the pristine PNIPAM/D2O system lacking any
additive in which the T2 relaxation time
after 130 h (5.5 days) recovers to its original value (Figure 9g).10 This corresponds to a state in which water, originally bound in
mesoglobules, is very slowly released from these structures, making
them more compact. Our observations indicate that the hydrophobic
association of PNIPAM and the studied additive molecules increases
the colloidal stability of phase-separated polymers sequestering the
solvent molecules (both D2O and the additive) within the
mesoglobular structure for extended periods (for at least 8 days in
the case of t-BuOH). It seems that after phase separation,
the additive (which hydrophobically associates with PNIPAM) acts as
a shell around the mesoglobules with effective steric stabilizing
properties,4 which prevents further aggregation
and precipitation.

DLS data provide information
about the size of PNIPAM globules
in the presence of additives (t-BuAM, t-BuOH, t-BuME, or t-BuMK). There
is no significant variation in the hydrodynamic diameters (∼230
nm) for t-BuAM, t-BuOH, and t-BuMK additives (Figure 10a). There is a relatively narrow distribution for t-BuAM, which might be caused by its Brønsted-type
base character (capability of accepting protons), resulting in a different
association mode with PNIPAM. For t-BuME additive,
it was found that the particle size was smaller at around 110 nm in
diameter (Figure 10b). This does not correlate with any additive property parameter
such as hydrophobicity (log P) or acidity (pKa) and is probably caused by some specific structure-related
intermolecular interactions between PNIPAM and t-BuME.

of hydrodynamic diameters.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have reported
the effect of low-molecular weight
additives, such as t-BuAM, t-BuOH, t-BuME, or t-BuMK, on the phase behavior
of the PNIPAM polymer in D2O solutions using NMR and DLS
methods. Phase separation was modeled as a two-state process. NMR
data were rationalized in terms of a modified van’t Hoff equation
fitted to the experimental data. This allowed us to obtain accurate
values of phase separation temperatures Tp and thermodynamic parameters, such as variations in enthalpy and
entropy connected with the phase separation of PNIPAM. We have found
that (depending on the additive type) the phase separation temperature Tp decreases (at a constant additive weight fraction)
in the following order: Tp(t-BuAM) > Tp(t-BuOH)
> Tp(t-BuME) > Tp(t-BuMK). Tp also decreases with an increasing concentration of additives.
This effect is strongest for t-BuMK with a Tp decrease of ca. 10 °C relative to the
pristine PNIPAM/D2O system. We found that the additives
hydrophobically associate with the PNIPAM chain, leading to the removal
of water molecules from the solvating shell of polymers, thus lowering
the enthalpy change of phase separation. An interesting correlation
between the pKa of additives and the phase
separation temperature Tp of PNIPAM, that
higher pKa (i.e., higher basicity) leads
to lower Tp, was also found. Time-resolved 1H NMR spin–spin relaxation experiments (T2) above the phase separation temperature revealed that
when PNIPAM is in a mesoglobular state, there is no change in the
restricted mobility of solvent molecules over the course of days.
This indicates the high colloidal stability of phase-separated polymers,
with trapping of the solvent molecules (both D2O and additives)
within its structure. This effect is in contrast to the PNIPAM/D2O system lacking additives in which the majority of water
is released from mesoglobules within 5 days. Therefore, a small quantity
of a suitable additive can be used for the tuning of PNIPAM properties,
such as phase separation temperature, colloidal stability, and morphology/dimensions
of formed mesoglobules. Improvements in the stabilities of colloidal
solutions of PNIPAM or similar polymers ought also to improve their
attractiveness for various applications either simply because of possibilities
for extending the stable shelf lives of preparations or because of
the tunability of phase separation properties within the physiologically
important temperature range.

4 Materials
and Methods
PNIPAM (Mw = 19 000–26 000
g/mol) (see Figure 1 for the structure) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. D2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.9% of deuterium) was used for sample preparation. tert-Butyl alcohol (t-BuOH), tert-butylamine (t-BuAM), tert-butyl
methyl ether (t-BuME), and tert-butyl
methyl ketone (t-BuMK) (see Figure 1 for the structures) were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All samples were sealed in 5 mm
NMR tubes. The weight fraction of PNIPAM in the binary solvent D2O/additive was calculated as wp = mp/(mp + mD2O + madditive) × 100% (in wt %), where mp, mD2O, and madditive are masses of the PNIPAM polymer, D2O, and additives, respectively. The composition of the binary
solvent D2O/additive was determined by the weight fraction
of an additive in D2O/additive solution as wadditive = madditive/(mD2O + madditive) × 100% (in wt %).

High-resolution 1H NMR
spectra were recorded using a
Bruker AVANCE III 600 spectrometer operating at 600.2 MHz. During
measurements at different temperatures, receiver gain was kept constant
to obtain comparable values of integrated intensities. The 1H spin–spin relaxation times T2 were measured using a CPMG pulse sequence of 90x° –
(td – 180y° – td)n—acquisition
with a half-echo time td = 5 ms. Each
experiment was performed over 4 scans with a relaxation delay between
scans of 120 s. The resulting T2 relaxation
curves are monoexponential. The fitting process made it possible to
determine consistently a single value of the relaxation time. The
relative error of T2 values of the HDO
and the additive (CH3)3 groups did not exceed
±8%. During measurement, temperature was maintained constant
within ±0.2 K using a BVT 3000 temperature unit. Prior to each
measurement, samples were equilibrated for about 15 min at the measurement
temperature.

The hydrodynamic diameter Dh (z-average) and size distribution of polymer
assemblies in
deuterated water (D2O) (wp =
0.015 wt %) were determined at 50 °C using a ZEN 3600 Zetasizer
Nano Instrument (Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). The data were
subsequently analyzed using the supplied Malvern Instruments software.
Prior to measurement, samples were filtered using a 0.22 μm
polyvinylidene fluoride filter to remove any interfering dust particles.
Each measurement consisted of an average of five scans.

a Comparison of exact numerical solution
of eq 7 (Tiexact) with approximate solution described by eq 11 (Tiapprox) shows
that for ΔH ≥ 105 J mol–1 and ΔS ≥ 200 J mol–1 K–1, the error is |Tiexact – Tiapprox| < 0.04 K. The
lower boundary of ΔH and ΔS is chosen as an extreme case far from experimentally obtained values.
For higher values of ΔH and ΔS, the error in determination of Ti using the approximate formula further decreases. Subsequently,
errors calculated (using exact and approximate values of Ti) for the phase separation temperature [Tp; eq 12] and the width of the phase separation [ΔTwidth; eq 14] are |Tpexact – Tpapprox| < 10–4 K and |ΔTwidthexact –
ΔTwidthapprox| < 10–4 K, respectively. Therefore, the approximations
used here introduce only negligible errors.
