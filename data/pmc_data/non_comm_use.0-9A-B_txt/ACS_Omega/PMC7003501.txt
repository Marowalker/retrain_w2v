Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill.
(S. chinensis) extract and its active
ingredient, schizandrin, have been used as a botanical medicine and
dietary supplement for the treatment of hepatitis. Lamivudine is an
antiretroviral drug and is used to treat hepatitis B viral infection.
The aim of this study was to develop an ultrahigh-performance liquid
chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC–MS/MS)
method for the measurement of lamivudine and to determine the pharmacokinetic
behaviors of an aqueous–ethanol extract of S.
chinensis in rats. The separation was performed on
a phenyl column maintained at 40 °C. The experimental animals
were distributed into three groups: (1) lamivudine alone (10 mg/kg,
i.v.); (2) lamivudine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) + pretreatment with S. chinensis (3 g/kg, p.o.); and (3) lamivudine (10
mg/kg, i.v.) + pretreatment with S. chinensis (10 g/kg, p.o.). The experimental results indicated that neither
treatment with lamivudine alone nor pretreatment with S. chinensis (3 or 10 g/kg) significantly changed
the pharmacokinetic parameters. In conclusion, based on the above
preclinical experimental model, the combination of lamivudine with
the herbal extract of S. chinensis did
not exhibit significant pharmacokinetic interactions. These data offer
useful information for assessing the preclinical safety of nutritional
supplementation with lamivudine.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The first reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nucleoside analog
(2′,3′-dideoxy-3′-thiacytidine, lamivudine) for
the therapy of hepatitis B viral infection was approved by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998; the next year,
the Department of Health in Taiwan approved the same drug for the
treatment of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection.1 A search of PubMed for botanical-derived drugs for the
treatment of chronic liver disease confirmed that single-herb medicines,
individual bioactive ingredients, and pharmaceutical preparations
of Schisandra chinensis,2 silymarin,3 and Salvia miltiorrhiza(4) are
often used by those suffering from chronic hepatitis. S. chinensis is a well-known traditional medicine
and supplement that has been widely used in Asia and Europe, due to
its hepatoprotective effects,5 for the
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus,6 and as an antioxidant.7 Recent research
has shown that dietary supplementation is commonly used for the promotion
of health or for disease prevention.8 Therefore,
dietary supplements containing S. chinensis extract are becoming increasingly popular in many Western cultures.
In the United States, extracts from S. chinensis and Schisandra sphenanthera are usually
incorporated into multicomponent dietary supplement preparations.
Therefore, it is important to explore the interactions between dietary
supplements containing S. chinensis and clinical medicines. Lamivudine and S. chinensis are commonly used for the treatment of hepatitis in Western and
Eastern medicines, respectively. However, few reports describe the
interactions of these two drugs from a pharmacokinetics perspective.

Several divergent analytical methods have been developed to measure
lamivudine in pharmaceutical products and biological samples. The
most widely used analytical techniques to assess lamivudine levels
are high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection
(HPLC–UV),9−11 tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS),12−15 high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC),16 capillary electrophoresis,17 and liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry
(LC–HRMS).18 In addition, several
analytical matrices have been studied, such as pharmaceutical tablets,16,18 human plasma, saliva, cerebrospinal fluid,10 human hair,15 human breast milk,12 dried blood spots,13 plasma, amniotic fluid, and rat tissues.19

To assess the novelty of this work, a search of the PubMed
database
was conducted, and it showed that no pharmacokinetic investigations
of the interaction between lamivudine and S. chinensis have been reported. In addition, based on the consumption of S. chinensis as a food product, we hypothesize that
the herbal extract of S. chinensis at
various doses would have only minor pharmacokinetic interactions.
To investigate this hypothesis, a UHPLC–MS/MS method for measuring
lamivudine was developed, validated, and used to assess herb–drug
pharmacokinetic interactions between lamivudine and S. chinensis in rats. The experimental rats were
divided into the following three groups: (1) lamivudine alone (10
mg/kg, i.v.); (2) lamivudine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) + pretreatment with S. chinensis (3 g/kg, p.o.; this dose is equivalent
to a dose of schizandrin of 5.2 mg/kg); and (3) lamivudine (10 mg/kg,
i.v.; this dose is equivalent to a dose of schizandrin of 17.3 mg/kg)
+ pretreatment with S. chinensis (10
g/kg, p.o.).

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Establishment of UHPLC–MS/MS Conditions
To assess
the mass spectral fragmentation pattern of lamivudine,
stock solutions of lamivudine (100 ng/mL) were analyzed by direct
injection into the spectrometer. The mass spectral peaks of lamivudine
and an internal standard at m/z 230.04
and 226.12 correspond to [M + H]+. The product ions, m/z 111.93 and 76.91, of these two analytes
were selected for quantification, as shown in Figure 1A,B.

Figure 1 Mass spectra of (A) lamivudine and (B) methyl
yellow (internal
standard).

Regarding the analytical conditions,
the positive mode was used
for analyte identification. To optimize the separation of the analytes,
reversed-phase C18 and C8 columns were considered.11,19 However, shoulders or tailing were seen in the chromatograms; therefore,
an end-capped phenyl column was selected, which may be more suitable
due to the hydrophilicity of the analyte.

Lamivudine and the
internal standard were detected in the positive
ion mode, and their retention times were approximately 2.5 and 2.3
min, respectively (Figure 2). Figure 2 shows the chromatogram of the extract of blank plasma obtained by
solid-phase extraction (SPE), and it indicated that the signal peaks
from the biological sample would not be affected by endogenous interferences.
With the exception of the analyte peaks, no chromatographic peaks
were detected in the plasma of untreated rats. Figure 2 also shows a chromatogram of blank plasma
spiked with lamivudine (10 ng/mL) and the internal standard (5 ng/mL).
These results revealed that the method offers acceptable selectivity
for the identification of lamivudine in biological samples.

was collected from the jugular vein at 120 min after lamivudine administration
(10 mg/kg, i.v.). 1: methyl yellow (internal standard); 2: lamivudine,
RT: 2.5 min.

The detection of analytes in the
positive ion mode via the monitoring
of the precursor–product association in the multiple reaction
monitoring (MRM) mode showed good sensitivity and intensity for analysis
of the target component. In this research, the selected reaction monitoring
transition was m/z 230.04 →
111.93 for lamivudine, which was consistent with previous research.20 The spectrometry conditions such as the analytical
column and the components and the ratio of the mobile phase were optimized
to achieve good peak shapes and intensities. Under the optimized conditions,
the retention times of lamivudine and methyl yellow were 2.5 and 2.3
min, respectively. The results showed that the peak shape in methanol
was better than in other solvents, and therefore, methanol was chosen
as the organic solvent. To optimize the intensity and peak shape and
avoid tailing, 0.1% aqueous formic acid was used as the aqueous component
of the mobile phase. Finally, a methanol–0.1% aqueous formic
acid solution was used as the mobile phase in this study.

In
our study, we developed an improved UHPLC–MS/MS method
for studying the effect of S. chinensis on the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine in rats. Previously, an HPLC–UV19 method was reported for the measurement of lamivudine
in rat plasma; however, this method requires a larger biological sample
volume and more time, and the sample preparation is laborious. In
addition, another reported HPLC–MS/MS method20 had a total run time of 8 min, while ours was no more than
5 min. In addition, the determination of the lamivudine concentration
in rat plasma is more accurate, facilitating pharmacokinetic studies.

2.2 Method Validation of Lamivudine in Rat Plasma
The standard profile was established by the peak–area ratios
of lamivudine to the internal standard. The standard curve for lamivudine
was y = 0.0023x + 0.001. The coefficient
of correlation for each standard profile was >0.995. The data indicated
that the linear concentration range of lamivudine was 5–1000
ng/mL. The results demonstrated good reproducibility. The limit of
detection (LOD) and lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) for lamivudine
were 1 and 5 ng/mL, respectively. The bias and the relative standard
deviation (RSD) were evaluated at concentrations of 5–500 ng/mL
for lamivudine. These data are shown in Table 1.

a Data are expressed as the mean ±
S.D. (n = 6).

The LLOQ and LOD are defined as the concentration at which the
signal/noise ratios of the analyte peak are 10 and 3, respectively.
Each RSD and bias value should be no more than ±15% (±20%
for LLOQ), which suggested an acceptable range. The data demonstrated
that this LC–MS/MS method is good for the quantitative analysis
of lamivudine in rat plasma. These outcomes demonstrated that the
method was appropriate for pharmacokinetics studied on lamivudine
in animal models.

Different lamivudine plasma concentrations
of 5, 50, and 500 ng/mL
were used to assess the matrix effects and recovery. The average recovery
and matrix effect values for lamivudine in biological samples were
105.7–119.6 and 88.9–94.8%, respectively, and these
values are presented in Table 2. The matrix effect data suggested that ion amplification
occurred. The results showed no significant differences within the
analytical range. After comparing the peak responses of the postextraction
and spiked samples, it was clear that the ratios of the peak responses
were within acceptable limits. The high reproducibility of the recovery
results demonstrated the reliability of the current method for bioanalysis.

Lamivudine
rat plasma concentrations of 5, 50, and 500 were used
to assess its stability. Stock solutions of lamivudine and the internal
standard were found to be stable for 30 days at −20 °C.
The data demonstrated that the lamivudine stored in plasma was not
significantly degraded after post-preparative storage for 8 h at 10
°C, after short-term storage for 8 h at ambient temperature,
after three freeze–thaw cycles at −20 °C and subsequent
thawing at ambient temperature, or after long-term storage for 1 month
at −80 °C, as presented in Table 3.

2.3 Sample Preparation
To optimize the
sample preparation procedure for rat plasma before UHPLC–MS/MS
analysis, solid-phase extraction (SPE), liquid–liquid extraction
(LLE), and protein precipitation (PPT) were examined. The recoveries
were less than 40% by the LLE and PPT methods. The SPE method provided
a recovery higher than 90%. Although the PPT method was used in a
previous report,20 the SPE column materials
are a hydrophilic N-vinylpyrrolidone and a lipophilic
divinylbenzene copolymer, which readily retain the analyte. In addition,
SPE is suitable for small sample volumes and consumes a small amount
of solvent.21 Our results are consistent
with a previous report that SPE provides high recovery, which may
be due to the hydrophilicity of lamivudine.22

2.4 Herbal–Drug Pharmacokinetic Interactions
of S. chinensis Extract and Lamivudine
The mean lamivudine concentration versus time curves for rat plasma
after the administration of lamivudine only (10 mg/kg) or lamivudine
(10 mg/kg) + pretreatment with S. chinensis (3 or 10 g/kg), with six rats in each group, are shown in Figure 3, and the pharmacokinetic
results are presented in Table 4. The pharmacokinetic models of the one- or two-compartment
model were compared with the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The
lowest AIC values best represented the concentration versus time data.
The data demonstrated that the AIC values for the one-compartmental
model at treatment with only lamivudine (10 mg/kg) and pretreatment
with oral S. chinensis (3 or 10 g/kg)
were −15.13, −11.95, and −10.48, respectively,
and the values with the two-compartmental model of the mean AIC values
were −52.93, −44.19, and −35.15, respectively.
Therefore, the two-compartmental model was selected for additional
pharmacokinetic analysis.

the administration of lamivudine alone (10 mg/kg, i.v.) and pretreatment
with different oral doses of S. chinensis (3 g/kg; this dose is equivalent to a schizandrin dose of 5.2 mg/kg)
and S. chinensis (10 g/kg; this dose
is equivalent to a schizandrin dose of 17.3 mg/kg). Data are expressed
as the mean ± S.D. (n = 6).

a Data are expressed

The concentration versus time
profiles of lamivudine in rat plasma
after the administration of lamivudine alone and pretreatment with
oral S. chinensis 3 and 10 g/kg are
shown in Figure 3.
The pharmacokinetic parameters of various groups are presented in Table 4. The pharmacokinetic
data demonstrated that the AUCs for the groups administered lamivudine
alone (10 mg/kg) and pretreatment with S. chinensis 3 and 10 g/kg for 5 days were 74.53 ± 11.30, 87.10 ± 3.51,
and 78.74 ± 4.79 min (μg/mL), respectively. The Cmax values were 7.02 ± 2.37, 7.83 ±
1.42, and 8.09 ± 2.39 μg/mL, respectively, and the elimination
half-lives (t1/2β) were 27.40 ±
2.60, 30.62 ± 5.43, and 21.49 ± 2.96 min, respectively.
These results demonstrated that there are no significant differences
between lamivudine only and S. chinensis pretreatment after lamivudine treatment (10 mg/kg). These results
indicated that there might not be a synergistic pharmacokinetic interaction
between S. chinensis and lamivudine
in animals (Table 4). These results are consistent with a previous lamivudine report
that the pharmacokinetic parameters were not significantly changed
by a Gentiana scabra preparation as
a herbal medicine.23 The results revealed
that the S. chinensis extract did not
significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.

According
to previous studies on drug metabolism, approximately
60% of clinically used drugs are related to cytochrome P450 (CYP).24 CYP3A4, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 are the primary enzyme
subtypes in the CYP450 system. CYP450 is the primary metabolic enzyme
in the human liver and intestine.25,26 The presence
of inhibitors of the CYP superfamily in herbs may cause botanical–drug
interactions and lead to serious side effects. Therefore, this is
a key clinical factor in the pharmacokinetics of potential herb–drug
interactions.27,28 Our pharmacokinetic results demonstrated
that the herb–drug coadministration of S. chinensis and lamivudine slightly increased lamivudine Cmax at the two tested dosage levels, but the increase was not
significant. The majority of oral lamivudine is unchanged by the kidneys
and excreted in urine (approximately 70%), and approximately 5–10%
is converted by hepatic metabolism into a trans-sulfoxide metabolite.29 Lamivudine is not significantly metabolized
by cytochrome P450 enzymes; nor does it inhibit or induce this enzyme
system. Previous studies have shown that S. chinensis extract had a significant inhibitory effect on the activities of
rat CYP1A2, 2C6, 2C11, 2D2, 2E1, and 3A1/2 in vitro. S. chinensis has been found to affect the pharmacokinetics
of several drugs.30,31 In addition, previous studies
have shown that some components of traditional Chinese medicine extracts
can inhibit or induce the activity of members of the CYP superfamily,
such as CYP 2E1, 1A2, and 3A4,32,33 which may cause significant
pharmacological interactions.

In our study, by applying our
improved methods for the detection
of lamivudine, we found that pretreatment with low and high doses
of S. chinensis did not significantly
influence the pharmacokinetics of lamivudine. Despite the increased Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of lamivudine,
significant differences in lamivudine pharmacokinetics after S. chinensis consumption were not observed. A possible
reason for the lack of interaction is that most of the components
of lamivudine are excreted through the kidneys and are not significantly
metabolized by cytochrome P450 enzymes. The dose of S. chinensis does not affect CYP expression. Therefore,
the possibility of drug interactions is low and there is also no significant
difference in pharmacokinetics. Because different components of the
herb may have their own biological characteristics, several factors,
such as the dosage regimen or the herbal formulation, may affect the
clinical applications.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
a UHPLC–MS/MS analytical method was developed
and precisely validated for the analysis of lamivudine in rat plasma.
This method also provides useful preclinical pharmacokinetic information
that, based on the above study, shows that S. chinensis and lamivudine may not have significant interactions. This study
provides safety information regarding the lack of significant herb–drug
pharmacokinetic interactions and should be very important as a reference
for additional clinical applications.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Reagents and Chemicals
Urethane, poly(ethylene
glycol) (PEG 400), and methyl yellow were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO). Lamivudine was obtained from the United States Pharmacopeia
(USP, Rockville, MD). S. chinensis was
obtained from Chia-Hui Inc., Taipei, Taiwan (product lot no. Q0606).
LC–MS grade methanol and formic acid were purchased from E.
Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Triply deionized water was used in these
experiments.

4.2 Preparation of the S. chinensisExtract
The extraction was performed
as follows: (1) the
dried fruits of S. chinensis (1.8 kg)
were soaked in 50% ethanol (24 L) in a stock pot for 120 min; (2)
the extracted liquid was condensed by rotary evaporation to remove
the solvent; and (3) water was removed using a freeze dryer. The resulting S. chinensis extract was stored at −80 °C.
The extraction yield from the herb was 330 g (18.3%). The active ingredient
in S. chinensis extract, schizandrin,
was quantified by analytical techniques. The LC–MS/MS results
are shown in Figure 4. The analytical method was performed on a Purospher STAR RP-18 end-capped
(100 mm × 2.1 mm, 2 μm, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany)
and the column oven was maintained at 40 °C. The mobile phase
consisted of methanol/0.1% aqueous formic acid (85:15, v/v) at a flow
rate of 0.2 mL/min, and the injection volume was 10 μL.

of schizandrin (345.44 μg/mL) in S. chinensis extract.

4.3 Experimental
Animals
All experimental
procedures were certified by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of National Yang-Ming University (IACUC number: 1060813r).
Urethane (1 g/kg) was used to anesthetize Sprague–Dawley rats
(240 ± 40 g, 6 weeks). The surgery was conducted with a razor
sterilized with a 75% alcohol solution, and polyethylene tubes were
placed into the femoral vein to administer the drug and into the right
jugular vein to gather rat plasma. The microtubes were rinsed with
heparinized saline (20 IU/mL). A 150 μL aliquot of rat blood
was withdrawn from the right jugular vein at 0.083, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75,
1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, and 4 h after administration. The rat blood was
centrifuged at 8000g for 5 min at 4 °C. The
supernatant was stored at −20 °C.

In clinical applications,
powdered S. chinensis extract is administered
at 7.5 g per dose34 for adult patients.
The S. chinensis dose conversion between
rats and humans was calculated based on the following formula: Human
equivalent dose (HED, mg/kg) = animal dose (mg/kg) × (animal
km/human km).35S. chinensisextract powder was suspended in triple deionized water at doses of
3 and 10 g/kg for oral administration. Lamivudine was dissolved in
triple deionized water and then administered via an i.v. injection
(10 mg/kg). All 18 animals were randomly separated into three groups,
each comprising six rats. The groups were as follows: (1) lamivudine
only (10 mg/kg, i.v.); (2) lamivudine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) + pretreatment
with S. chinensis (3 g/kg, p.o.); and
(3) lamivudine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) + pretreatment with S. chinensis (10 g/kg, p.o.). Group 1 was initially
anesthetized using urethane (1 g/kg) and was then given lamivudine
(10 mg/kg, i.v.) alone through the femoral vein. Groups 2 and 3 were
pretreated with different doses of S. chinensis for five consecutive days, and on the fifth day, 1 h after pretreatment
with S. chinensis, the rats were anesthetized
with urethane (1 g/kg) to perform surgery and after the animal experiment.
Finally, lamivudine (10 mg/kg, i.v.) was injected into the femoral
vein.

4.4 Sample Preparation of Lamivudine
A solid-phase extraction (SPE) method was applied to extract lamivudine
from biological samples. First, Oasis HLB extraction cartridges (Waters
Corp., Milford, MA) were equilibrated using methanol (2 mL) and triple
deionized water (2 mL). Then, 50 μL of a real sample was added
to the tube. Then, the SPE tube was washed using triple deionized
water (1 mL) and 5% methanol. Finally, the lamivudine was eluted from
the tube using acetonitrile. The eluent was gathered in 2 mL microcentrifuge
tubes and heated at 50 °C for 50 min to evaporate the solvent.
The dried samples were redissolved in 50% methanol (190 μL)
and an internal standard (10 μL), and then injected into the
analytical equipment.

4.5 LC–MS/MS
The liquid chromatography–tandem
mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) system consisted of a quaternary
pump, an autosampler, and a column oven (Waters ACQUITY UHPLC, Milford,
MA). An electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive-ionization
mode was used in the experiments. The separation was performed on
an ACQUITY UHPLC BEH Phenyl analytical column (100 mm × 2.1 mm,
1.7 μm, Waters, Dublin, Ireland) and maintained at 40 °C
with a column oven. The mobile phase consisted of methanol/0.1% aqueous
formic acid (85:15, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, and the injection
volume was 10 μL. The apparatus conditions were optimized to
the following: source temperature, 150 °C; desolvation gas, nitrogen;
cone voltage, 24 V; capillary voltage, 3.2 kV; desolvation gas flow
rate, 800 L/h; desolvation temperature 400 °C; and collision
energy, 14 V.

4.6 Method Validation
The method was
validated to confirm that it met the requirements for analytical methods
indicated by the FDA guidelines.36 The
method was validated in terms of precision, accuracy, recovery, matrix
effects, and stability.

4.6.1 Evaluation of Linearity,
Accuracy, and Precision
The calibration curve was prepared
in the range from 5 to 500 ng/mL.
The coefficient of variation for each standard profile was at least
>0.99. The intraday precision and accuracy were estimated by analyzing
three different quality control (QC) samples (low, middle, and high
concentrations) six times in a single day. In contrast, the interday
precision and accuracy were assessed by analyzing the QC samples on
six consecutive days. Accuracy refers to the closeness of the experimental
value to the real value based on the following formula: (bias %) =
[(Cobs – Cnom)/Cnom] × 100. The precision
is used to describe the reproducibility of the results as follows:
relative standard deviation (RSD %) = [standard deviation (SD)/Cobs] × 100. Except for the bias and coefficient
of variation of the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), which were
not permitted to exceed ±20%, others were kept within ±15%.

4.6.2 Matrix Effects and Recovery
The
matrix effects and recoveries of lamivudine in rat plasma samples
were evaluated at low, middle, and high QC concentrations (5, 50,
and 500 ng/mL, respectively). The internal standard concentration
was 5 ng/mL. Three extraction methods (sets 1–3) were used
to assess the matrix effects and recoveries in the validation of the
analytical method.

Set 1: Lamivudine stock solutions: Aliquots
(10 μL) of lamivudine solution (5, 50, and 500 ng/mL) and internal
standards (10 μL) were mixed with 180 μL of methanol in
microcentrifuge tubes. After mixing, the solutions were delivered
to an autosampler and injected into the analytical apparatus.

Set 2: Lamivudine solutions spiked after extraction. The rat plasma
was handled using SPE. First, the extraction cartridge (Oasis HLB
30 μm) was equilibrated using methanol (2 mL) and triple deionized
water (2 mL). Then, 50 μL of the sample was added to the tube.
The SPE tube was washed using triple deionized water (1 mL) and methanol
(5%). Finally, the lamivudine was eluted using acetonitrile. The eluent
was gathered in microcentrifuge tubes, and 10 μL of lamivudine
solution (5, 50, and 500 ng/mL) was added to these tubes. These mixtures
were heated at 50 °C for 50 min to evaporate the solvent. The
dried extract was redissolved in 50% methanol (190 μL), internal
standard (10 μL) was added, and the mixture was injected into
the analytical apparatus.

Set 3: Lamivudine liquids spiked pre-extraction.
All rat plasma
samples were processed using SPE. Blank plasma (50 μL) and 10
μL of lamivudine solution (5, 50, and 500 ng/mL) were placed
in microcentrifuge tubes and then mixed before extraction. Then, the
extraction cartridge (Oasis HLB 30 μm) was equilibrated with
methanol (2 mL) and triple deionized water (2 mL). Then, 50 μL
of the spiked samples was added to the tube. The SPE tube was washed
using triple deionized water (1 mL) and methanol (5%). Finally, lamivudine
was eluted using acetonitrile. The eluent was gathered in microcentrifuge
tubes and heated at 50 °C for 50 min to evaporate the solvent.
The dried extract was redissolved in 50% methanol (190 μL) and
internal standard (10 μL). Then, 10 μL of this mixture
was injected into the analytical system. The matrix effect (%) was
estimated using the following formula: sets 2/1. Recovery (%) was
estimated using the following formula: sets 3/2.

4.6.3 Stability
The following four conditions
were used to evaluate the stability of lamivudine in rat plasma: long-term,
short-term, post-preparative, and freeze–thaw conditions. Low,
medium, and high concentrations of lamivudine (5, 50, and 500 ng/mL)
were selected for assessing stability.(1) Short-term stability was evaluated
based on quality control samples and stored at ambient temperature
for 8 h.

(2) Post-preparative
stability was assessed
from quality control samples stored in an autosampler at 10 °C
for 8 h.

(3) Long-term
stability was assessed from
quality control samples stored at −20 °C for 30 days.

(4) Freeze–thaw stability
was assessed
from quality control samples maintained at −20 °C for
24 h and thawed under ambient conditions. The freeze–thaw cycle
was repeated for a total of three cycles. The stability (%) was evaluated
as follows: stability (%) = (Cobs/Cnom) × 100%.



4.7 Pharmacokinetic Analysis and Statistics
The pharmacokinetic program of WinNonlin Standard Edition software
version 1.1 with noncompartment and compartment models was used to
calculate the pharmacokinetic parameters for oral and intravenous
administration. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version
24.0 (SPSS, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Student’s t test was used to compare the differences between groups, and a value
of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
The Akaike information criterion (AIC) was utilized to evaluate the
compartment model used for data processing.37 The pharmacokinetic parameters are explained as follows: the area
under the curve (AUC) for concentration–time is defined as
the plot of concentration of lamivudine in plasma against time. Cmax is defined as the highest concentration
of lamivudine in blood after administration, and the time to reach
this concentration is Tmax. Clearance
(CL) is defined as the ability of the body to discharge drugs and
is given by the following formula: CL = Dose/AUC. The mean residence
time (MRT) of a drug molecule is the average time that it remains
in the body.
