This work aims at assessing the influence
of two different solvents,
bidistilled water and toluene, on dispersions of carbon-based engineered
nanomaterials, namely, fullerenes, and their self-assembly behavior.
The obtained self-assembled carbon-based materials were characterized
using UV–vis spectrophotometry and transmission electron microscopy
techniques. The results obtained were unexpected when toluene was
used for dispersing fullerene C60, with the formation of
two different types of self-assembled structures: fullerene C60 nanowhiskers (FNWs) and a type of quasispherical nanostructure.
The FNWs ranged between 1 and 6 μm in length, whereas the quasispherical
fullerene C60 nanoaggregates ranged between 10 and 50 nm
in diameter. Aggregates obtained in toluene showed a well-formed crystal
structure. When using water, the obtained aggregates were amorphous
and showed a no well-defined shape. Their sizes ranged between 20
and 40 nm for nanosized structures and between 0.4 and 4.8 μm
for micron-sized self-aggregates.

1 Introduction
Engineered carbon-based
nanomaterials are being used in a large
number of biomedical applications, such as drug-delivery systems,1 cancer therapy,2 and
theranostics, as well as in electronic devices. It is well known that
buckminsterfullerene or fullerene C60 is a truncated icosahedron
(Ih) formed by sp2-hybridized
atoms of carbon. Its peculiar external shape is due to a combination
of 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons.

Allotropic forms of carbon show significant properties,
such as optoelectrical, optoelectronic, and redox properties; effective
n-doping of organic semiconductors; and high conductivity,3 which make of them one of the most promising
elements in chemistry. Self-assembled nanostructures show electron-transfer
improvements when compared with planar electron acceptors. This property
allows the development of organic electron devices (e.g., field-effect
transistors and solar cells)4,5 and optoelectronic devices.

Different syntheses approaches of self-assembled fullerene derivatives
have been reported, such as supramolecular approaches,6,7 controlled precipitation,8−12 template methods,13 and photoassisted
growth.11 In this article, we report on
a method for obtaining of fullerene C60 self-assembled
nanostructures that avoids liquid–liquid interface precipitation
(LLIP) and several other issues associated with previously reported
preparation routes.14 Instead of using isopropyl alcohol
as a solvent in the LLIP method9 or modifications
for faster preparation, as reported by Jin et al.,15 we chose a simple method based on self-assembly. This new
method yielded a bimodal population of carbon-based materials and
finally enabled us to assess the aggregation behavior in two solvents.
Our aim in this work was to explore the self-assembly behavior as
a function of solvent redispersion nature (solubility) and the structural
implications in the final products.

Supramolecular assemblies
are defined as chemical structures organized
by means of noncovalent bonds, for instance, hydrogen bonds,16,17 π–π interactions,18−20 van der Waals interactions,21,22 and coordination bonds.23,24 Our supramolecular
self-aggregates involve quasispherical aggregates of fullerene C60 nanoparticles (FC60 NPs), with a diameter ranging
from 10 to 50 nm; on the other hand, we also found fullerene C60 nanowhiskers (FNWs),a with a length
ranging from 1 to 6 μm.

2 Results and Discussion
Typical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) low-magnification
images of the samples obtained by redispersing C60 in bidistilled
water are shown in Figure 1. It appears that in this dispersion medium C60 fullerenes form amorphous aggregates. Additionally, spontaneous
production of a slight brownish yellow coloration was observed in
the aqueous solution of fullerene C60.

Figure 1 TEM images of fullerene
C60 redispersed in bidistilled
water. Scale bar: (a) 1 μm, (b) 100 nm, and
(c) 50 nm.

A large variety of particles sizes
and shapes were identified.
The particles show irregular edges and differences in contrast due
to different thicknesses. Despite the small size of the fullerene
seeds (1–2 nm in diameter), a mixture of large (micron-sized)
and small (20–40 nm) structures was obtained. The internal
structure of the aggregates was investigated by electron diffraction,
and the obtained data showed a diffraction pattern that corresponds
to that of an amorphous structure. This result clearly points toward
aggregates that have a disordered internal structure.

Quite
a different rearrangement was observed when C60 fullerenes
were redispersed in toluene. This different behavior
was confirmed and characterized using UV–vis spectroscopy,
TEM, high-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM), and electron energy-loss
spectroscopy (EELS). In this case, the aggregates of fullerene
C60 showed a crystalline face-centered cubic (fcc)27 structure, forming two different types of aggregates,
namely, FC60 NPs and FNWs.

Figure 2 shows TEM
images of the self-assembled nano- and micro-structures obtained on
redispersing fullerene C60 in toluene. Clearly, the self-assembled
nanostructures, including FC60 NPs (20–40 nm) and
FNWs (0.4–4.8 μm), have a bimodal shape and size. FNWs
have often been obtained using the LLIP method; from now on, we will report on the
different behaviors as a function of solvent dispersion nature.28

Figure 2 TEM images of fullerene C60 redispersed in toluene forming (a) FC60 NPs and (b) FNWs, and (c) selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern obtained from a single nanowhisker.

UV–vis absorbance spectra of FNWs at several
concentrations
in toluene are shown in Figure 3. As can be seen, we found a small peak near λAbs = 407 nm, but the maximum absorbance intensity was observed at about
335–336 nm; this is different from previously reported data
on pure fullerene C60 redispersed in several solvents,
like hexane, wherein a maximum λAbs near 329 nm was
reported.29 The two peaks found in the
UV–vis absorption spectra were assigned to (a) the effects
exerted by the environment on fullerene C60 molecules (λAbs = 335–336 nm) and (b) the vibronic structure and
effects of the surrounding environment on fullerene C60 molecules (λAbs = 407 nm).30 The UV–vis spectra obtained with water as the solvent showed
maximum peaks at 265 and 345 nm, as previously reported by Scharff
et al.31 We associated this small shift in the spectra, when compared to those with toluene,
to the hydration of fullerene C60 by water molecules. The
heating caused by sonication in small areas of the initial fullerene
C60–toluene solution can induce a change in the
small amount of fullerene C60 seeds to a point at which
the polymerization process starts between neighboring molecules. Following
sonication at room temperature, enhanced by sunlight (UV–vis
radiation), the formation of crystalline FNWs and FC60 NPs
was confirmed by optical and transmission microscopy observations,
consistent with the findings of previous works.32 Aggregation of the fullerene C60 nanoparticles
continued, which finally rendered a nanowhisker structure; upon storing
the C60 nanoparticles for 2 weeks at 2 °C, we obtained
FNWs as large as 60.13 μm, as measured by electron microscopy.

aliquots in 2 mL of toluene). Inset: Enhanced image of the peak found
at 407 nm. Naked-eye observation of C60 redispersed in

HRTEM images showing a core–shell structure of FNWs are shown in Figure 4a. In this image,
the growth axis of the core (Figure 4b) was identified to be in the ⟨011⟩
crystalline direction; the corresponding Fourier-transform (FT) displaying
the [011] zone axis of the cubic fcc crystalline structure of the
FNW core is shown in Figure 4c.

Figure 4 (a) HRTEM image showing the core–shell structure of the
FNWs. (b) HRTEM lattice image showing the structure of the core obtained
from the area depicted in (a). (c) FT of (b) with the indexes of the
spots calculated on the basis of the fcc crystalline structure. (d,
e) Growth axes of the core and shell, respectively. (f) FT obtained
from (e), indexed on the basis of the body-centered tetragonal (bct)
crystalline structure.

However, analyses of the FT obtained from the shell area
confirmed
the [010] zone axis, which established the ⟨200⟩ crystalline
direction as the growth axis of the shell parallel to the larger axis
of the nanowhiskers and confirmed the presence of a bct tetragonal
structure on the shell. Coincidentally, as was previously reported
by Miyazawa et al.,33 the same growth axis,
⟨200⟩, was determined previously in the bct tetragonal
structure of the FNWs. In the present case, HRTEM images also show
clear differences between the inner structure (core cubic crystalline
structure) and shell (tetragonal crystalline structure). HRTEM images
and FT also confirmed a core@shell structure formed by two different
crystalline structures, with planes and growth axes different in both
the core and shell. These differences were also previously
observed in nanowhiskers by Miyazawa34 and
have been reported in the LLIP method of FNWs synthesis. We also found
a difference of 0.5% dhkl in the Miller
indices when compared to previously reported data on pristine fullerene
C60 crystals.35

The influence
of solvent36 on the redispersion
and coassembly of fullerene37 has been
previously reported, and its significance has also been underlined,38 but here, we intend to stress on the influence
of electronic interactions on the assembly process. EELS allowed us
to determine the nature of C–C bonds present in the internal
structure of C60 fullerenes found in both FC60 NPs and FNWs. As this bimodal population was formed as consequence
two different self-assembly pathways, it was important to be sure
that these two different types of particles had the same electronic
configuration, as evidenced by the indexing of SAED. Results are
shown in Figure 5,
and they suggest that the bonds established between C60 fullerenes as building units are responsible for the formation of
both aggregates.

Figure 5 Electron energy-loss spectra of self-aggregated FC60 NPs (black solid circles) and FNWs (blue solid circles).

Basically, the presence of shoulders
with the same shape in EELS
confirmed the existence of σ and π bonds in the internal
structure of the FC60 NPs and in the FNWs.39 In view of this, it is also clear that
the structure of individual fullerene molecules remained unchanged
within a nanowhisker.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, we studied the influence of solvent in a simple
one-step method to redisperse the fullerene C60 avoiding
the use of a polymeric stabilizer, by means of self-assembly of these
carbon-based nanomaterials. In toluene, we obtained two different
types of crystalline structures: FNWs, having a length of 1–6
μm, and FC60 NPs, with a diameter of 10–50
nm. In water, we obtained two amorphous populations, one with a size
of 20–40 nm and the second with a size of 0.4–4.8 μm,
which are larger than the former. Both optical and structural characterizations
confirmed the formation of these self-assembled structures. The formation
of these shape allotropes of carbon can be due to steric and electrostatic
rearrangements of the fullerene C60 involved in the redispersion
as a function of solvent nature. Previous work of Hughes et al. underlined that C60 shows very low solubility
in water, whereas the solubility of C60 in toluene is 2.8
mg/mL, which is an important factor to take into account in our experiments
and in further studies.40

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
C60 fullerene
was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich at the maximum commercially available
purity of 99.5% (Germany),41 with no further
treatment. Toluene was commercially obtained from Panreac (Spain)
(99.9%). Bidistilled water showing 0.10–0.50 μS cm–1 conductance was used for synthesis.

4.2 Carbon-Based Nanomaterial Redispersion: Synthesis
of FNWs
In a one-step simple ultrasound-assisted synthesis
method, we used bidistilled water and toluene to test the influence
of the nature of two solvents on the redispersion of carbon-based
nanomaterials.42,43 Briefly, different amounts of
C60 fullerene (0.5–40 mg mL–1/6.94
× 10–4–5.55 × 10–2 M) were redispersed as saturated solutions of engineered nanomaterials
in bidistilled water and toluene. We did not perform any further treatment;
no filtration of the stock solutions was carried out; and we did not
use any other polymer or surfactant to stabilize the suspension or
obtain pristine carbon nanomaterials. Using a Branson 3510 ultrasonic bath,
frequency 40 kHz, redispersion of the C60 fullerene was
carried out over 5 min at 298 K, and then, the solutions were stored
at room temperature until morphological observations were carried
out. First, all fullerene C60 samples in water and toluene
were exposed to ultrasonication at room temperature (298 K) under
sunlight (it is known that the crystalline structures of fullerene
C60 trend to grow under UV–vis radiation). These
samples were stored at room temperature until morphological measurements
by HRTEM were carried out (ca. 1 h). Then, the samples were stored
at 2 °C and light-protected for 3 weeks until morphological characterization
was carried out again. Samples for UV–vis absorbance spectroscopy
were freshly prepared using the same ultrasound bath. Characterization
was carried out in triplicate
for every measurement to confer reproducibility of the experiments.
TEM analyses were performed using a JEOL JEM1010 TEM operating at
an accelerating voltage of 100 kV, whereas HRTEM was performed using
a JEOL JEM2010F HRTEM operating at 200 kV. EEL spectra were recorded
following standard and well-known methods. In brief, measurements
were carried out at an operation voltage of 200 kV in the STEM mode
using a Gatan GIF Quantum spectrometer, with an energy resolution
of 1.75 eV (FWHM zero loss peak), 0.5 eV/channel energy dispersion,
and an EELS collection semiangle of 16 mrad. To avoid the contribution
of the grid carbon foil, the EELS spectra were collected from areas
of the sample situated over a hole. The background EEL spectra were
subtracted using standard routines of Digital Micrograph. Samples
for TEM and HRTEM were prepared by dropping and evaporating the obtained
colloid on top of a carbon-coated copper grid.

The authors emphasize
that the sonication time was selected on the basis of macroscopic
observations. The observation of a change in the turbidity and color
of the solution after sonication for 5 min suggested a change in the
optical properties of the solution; this was the reason behind exploring
the optical properties and morphology. Further experiments (either
kinetically or thermodynamically controlled) are necessary to clarify
and explain the formation process of the above-mentioned structures
in detail.
