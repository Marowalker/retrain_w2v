An
efficient two-step synthesis of symmetrical and unsymmetrical
tetrahydrospirobiquinolines from o-azidobenzaldehydes
is reported. A novel series of tetrahydrospirobiquinolines was prepared
by sequential double-aldol condensation with acetone, cyclopentanone,
and cyclohexanone to form the corresponding o,o′-diazido-dibenzylidene-acetone, -cyclopentanone,
and -cyclohexanone derivatives, respectively, and hydrogenation–spirocyclization.
The spirodiamines were further derivatized by electrophilic aromatic
bromination, Suzuki coupling, and N-alkylation, all
of which proceeded with preservation of the spirocyclic core.

Introduction
Access to a broad range
of structurally diverse nitrogen heterocycles
is important in probing and understanding biological functions and
may lead to the discovery of new medicines and agricultural chemicals.
Fused-ring nitrogen heterocycles are considered privileged scaffolds
in both medicinal chemistry and agrochemistry.1 There is a need to expand the structural classes of amines, especially
to those that are C-(sp3)-rich, to enhance the structural
complexity and for better interaction with biological targets.2 Whereas spiroketals, including benzannulated
systems,3−7 are common scaffolds in biologically active heterocyclic compounds
and spirocyclic compounds with a single oxygen and single aminonitrogen
attached to the spirane center are known,8,9 spirodiamines,
which contain two amino-groups at that center, are far less well studied.10−13 The spirodiamine core is known in several natural products, including
(−)-isochizogamine (1),14−16 isoschizogaline
(2),17 (+)-melodinine-E (3),18−20 and the immunosuppressant (±)-spiroreticulatine
(4) (Figure 1).21

Following earlier work,13 we reported
a concise synthesis method of spirodiamine 6 from the
crossed Claisen condensation of lactam 5 and decarboxylative
spirocyclization.10 In these studies, we
demonstrated that spirodiamine 6 underwent metal complexation
or a reaction with electrophiles, with either preservation of the
spirocyclic core or ring opening and derivatization of 4-aminobutyl-1-tetrahydropyridine
core 7 (Figure 2).10

In contrast, the synthesis and reactions of benzannulated
spirodiamines
have not been reported. Inspired by the ubiquitous biological activity
of tetrahydroisoquinoline derivatives, we considered that the tetrahydrospirobiquinoline
scaffold may provide access to novel pharmacophores and ligands for
metal complexation. Indeed, benzannulated spiroketals, 13, (Figure 3) have
been well studied and synthesized most notably by Ding, Wang, and
Zhou.22−25

Results and Discussion
By analogy
with benzannulated spiroketals, we envisaged that increasing the rigidity
of the diaza
scaffold of spirodiamine 6 would displace the spirodiamine 6 to aminoimine 7 equilibrium toward the spirane
tautomer. We therefore sought to synthesize a range of tetrahydrospirobiquinolines, 14, from the double-aldol condensation of o-azidobenzaldehydes with ketones to provide the corresponding diazido-dibenzylidene-ketones,
followed by reductive cyclization (Figure 3). Initial studies were directed toward the
synthesis of tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 14a. o-Azidobenzaldehyde 15a was allowed to react
with acetone in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide to afford
dienone 17a (94% yield). Subsequent hydrogenation over
palladium on carbon gave tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 14a (Scheme 1), the structure
of which was confirmed by two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy and X-ray
crystal structure determination.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 3,3′,4,4′-Tetrahydro-1H,1′H-2,2′-spirobi[quinoline] 14a
A two-step reaction
was used for the synthesis of a range of tetrahydrospirobiquinolines
from the corresponding aromatic aldehydes and acetones,26,27 including extended aromatic systems; electron-rich and electron-poor
systems; as well as ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted examples, 14b–g (Table 1). The yields show little deviation, with the exceptions of p-Cl (14g, entry 6), for which some dechlorination
was observed, and o-Me (14d, entry 4),
for which steric congestion is greater.

Furthermore,
cyclopentanone and cyclohexanone can readily replace
acetone to produce pentacyclic tetrahydrospirobiquinolines 18 and 19, both as single diastereoisomers, as determined
by both 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy (Scheme 2). These are consistent
with the symmetrical trans product for cyclopentanone derivative 18 and desymmetrized cis product 19. These relative
stereochemistries were confirmed in both cases by X-ray crystallography
after tetrabromination (see Supporting Information).

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Pentacyclic Tetrahydrospirobiquinolines 18 and 19
The origins of these diastereoselectivities were probed
using dispersion-corrected
density functional theory calculations (B3LYP+D3BJ/Def2-TZVPP/SCRF
= ethanol)28 of relative free energies
(ΔΔG298), with the assumption
of fast equilibria between amine–imine and spirodiamine. The
dipole moments computed for the former class were uniformly higher
(3.8–4.9 D) than those for the latter (1.1–1.7 D). The
equilibrium free energies did not provide sufficient support for the
observed diastereoselectivity. We speculate that the stabilities of
the two intermediate ketones are predominant factors in the overall
stereochemical control. On the basis of the known preferential formation
of cis-2,5-dibenzyl-cyclopentanone and cis-2,6-dibenzyl-cyclohexanone on the palladium-catalyzed hydrogenation
of the corresponding 2,5- or 2,6-benzylidene ketones and the facile
cis to trans isomerization of the former, equivalent cis to trans
isomerization took place prior to spirocyclization with spirane 18 but not with spirane 19.29,30 Alternatively, the opposite diastereoisomers do not spirocyclize
and exist as amine–imine isomers, which were not isolated chromatographically
due to their higher polarities. Attempts were made to isolate these
compounds as well as to cyclize them upon treatment with a variety
of Lewis and Brønsted acids;24 however,
this was unsuccessful. Further investigations into these systems are
ongoing in our laboratory.

To expand on the potential number
of derivatives accessible by
the method, unsymmetrical systems were also studied. Application of
the known sequential condensation reaction of acetone with two different o-azido-benzaldehyde derivatives, 20 and 22,31 hydrogenation, and spirocyclization
gave tetrahydrospirobiquinolines 24a and 24b (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis
of Unsymmetrical Tetrahydrospirobiquinolines 24a and 24b
Reaction of tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 14a with varying
equivalents of N-bromosuccinimide (NBS) gave brominated
products 25 and 26 in 56 and 74% yields,
respectively. Dibromination first occurs para to the nitrogen to yield
the dibromo analogue 25; then, it occurs ortho to the
nitrogen to yield the tetrabromo analogue 26 (Scheme 4), with both structures
being confirmed by X-ray crystal structure determinations.

Scheme 4 Bromination
of Tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 14a with NBS
Scheme 5 Suzuki–Miyuara Cross-Coupling
of Tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 26
Bromide 26 was converted to tetraphenyl-derivative 27 (67%) by Suzuki–Miyaura coupling with phenylboronic
acid (Scheme 5). Most
importantly, this demonstrates the robustness of the benzannulated
spirodiamine core, which tolerates palladium-mediated cross-coupling.
The structure of spirane-diamine 27 was confirmed by
X-ray crystal structure determination.

We also investigated
derivatization by substitution
at the nitrogen of the spirane center. Unsurprisingly, a combination
of electronics and steric congestion of the aniline nitrogens mandated
forcing conditions for alkylation reactions. Thus, alkylation of tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 14a with n-butyllithium in tetrahydrofuran
(THF) and hexamethylphosphoramide (HMPA) and iodomethane gave dimethyl
derivative 28a (90%), and allyl bromide afforded the
diallyl derivative 28b (81%), again with preservation
of the spirocyclic framework (Scheme 6). This is in contrast to allylation of spirodiamine 6, which results in reaction of the amino group of aminoimine
tautomer 7 (Figure 2).10 Diallyl tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 28b smoothly underwent ring-closing metathesis, giving pentacyclic
tetrahydrospirobiquinoline 29. The structure of spirane-diamine 29 was confirmed by X-ray crystal structure determination.

Conclusions
We have developed a chemically robust and
straightforward procedure
for the synthesis of tetrahydrospirobiquinoline derivatives, a class
of understudied heterocyclic compounds. Further syntheses and applications
of spirodiamines, including tetrahydrospirobiquinolines, will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
General Remarks
All reactions were carried out in oven-dried
glassware under atmospheric conditions using commercially supplied
solvents and reagents, unless otherwise stated. Large-scale hydrogenations
were carried out in a Parr hydrogenator. Column chromatography was
carried out on silica gel using flash chromatography techniques, unless
otherwise stated (eluents are given in parentheses). Analytical thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated silica gel F254 aluminum
plates, with visualization under UV light or by staining with an acidic
vanillin dip. Melting points were measured with a hot-stage apparatus
and are uncorrected. IR spectra were recorded on neat films. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded at 400
and 101 MHz, respectively, with chemical shifts (δ) quoted in
ppm, relative to CHCl3 (1H: 7.26 ppm, 13C: 77.16 ppm).

Safety Note
Although low-molecular-weight
azides are
potentially hazardous, we have had no issues with any of the intermediates
in terms of their thermal stability or uncontrolled decomposition.
However, it is advised that these compounds be handled carefully,
behind a blast shield. When carrying out SNAr reactions
with sodium azide, it is advised that the solutions be kept basic,
with the addition of 20 mol % Et3 N or an equivalent of
2,6-lutidine, with constant sparging with argon to clear the headspace,
as published by Zhou et al.35

was cooled to 0 °C under argon. NaN3 (1.80 g, 27.7
mmol, 2.0 equiv) was added in one portion, and the resultant solution
was heated to 60 °C with constant sparging with argon for 2 h.
Following this, the mixture was cooled to room temperature, diluted
with H2O (50 mL), and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50
mL). The combined organic extracts were washed sequentially with 5%
aqueous LiCl (3 × 50 mL) and brine (1 × 50 mL) and dried
(MgSO4). The solvent was rotary-evaporated to give azide 15b as a yellow crystalline solid, without the need for further
purification (2.42 g, 87%): melting point (mp) 50–51 °C

under an argon atmosphere and heated at 60 °C with sparging with
argon. After 1 h, the mixture was allowed to cool, diluted with H2O (50 mL), and extracted with EtOAc (3 × 50 mL). The
combined organic extracts were washed sequentially with 5% aqueous
LiCl (3 × 50 mL) and brine (1 × 50 mL) and dried (MgSO4). After rotary evaporation, the residue was chromatographed
(gradient; pentane/CH2Cl2 1:1 to 0:1) to give

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Tetrahydrospirobiquinolines
(14a–g)
o-Azido-benzaldehyde
(2.0 mmol, 2.0 equiv) in absolute EtOH (20 mL) was cooled in an ice
bath. Me2CO (73 μL, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) was added,
followed by the addition of 2 M NaOH (2.5 mL, 5.0 mmol, 5.0 equiv)
dropwise over 30 s, with stirring. The ice bath was removed, and after
4 h at room temperature, the resultant precipitate was collected by
filtration and washed with ice-cold absolute EtOH. The slurry was
resuspended in EtOH (20 mL) with 10% Pd/C (10 wt %) and stirred under
a hydrogen atmosphere (balloon) for 16 h. The catalyst was removed
by filtration, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.
The purification for each spirobiquinoline is given separately.
