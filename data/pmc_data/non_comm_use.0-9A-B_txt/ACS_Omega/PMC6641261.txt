This
paper reports the synthesis of two-dimensional, hierarchical,
porous, and (001)-faceted metal (Ag, Zn, and Al)-doped TiO2 nanostructures (TNSs) and the study of their photocatalytic activity.
Two-dimensional metal-doped TNSs were synthesized using the hydrolysis
of ammonium hexafluorotitanate in the presence of hexamethylenetetramine
and metal precursors. Typical morphology of metal-doped TNSs is a
hierarchical nanosheet that is composed of randomly stacked nanocubes
(dimensions of up to 5 μm and 200 nm in edge length and thickness,
respectively) and has dominant (001) facets exposed. Raman analysis
and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that the Ag
doping, compared to Zn and Al, much improves the crystallinity degree
and at the same time dramatically lowers the valence state binding
energy of the TNS and provides an additional dopant oxidation state
into the system for an enhanced electron-transfer process and surface
reaction. These are assumed to enhance the photocatalytic of the TNS.
In a model of photocatalytic reaction, that is, rhodamine B degradation,
the AgTNS demonstrates a high photocatalytic activity by converting
approximately 91% of rhodamine B within only 120 min, equivalent to
a rate constant of 0.018 m–1 and ToN and ToF of
94 and 1.57 min–1, respectively, or 91.1 mmol mg–1 W–1 degradation when normalized
to used light source intensity, which is approximately 2 times higher
than the pristine TNS and several order higher when compared to Zn-
and Al-doped TNSs. Improvement of the crystallinity degree, decrease
in the defect density and the photogenerated electron and hole recombination,
and increase of the oxygen vacancy in the AgTNS are found to be the
key factors for the enhancement of the photocatalytic properties.
This work provides a straightforward strategy for the preparation
of high-energy (001) faceted, two-dimensional, hierarchical, and porous
Ag-doped TNSs for potential use in photocatalysis and photoelectrochemical
application.

Introduction
Morphology, atomic
stoichiometry, and surface physicochemical properties
of catalyst systems determine the photocatalytic activity, charge
transfer, and other surface reactions.1−7 Catalysts with morphology containing high-energy facets and wide
surface areas are highly demanded as they could generate excellent
photochemical activity. For the anatase TiO2 nanocatalyst,
the (001) facet is the highest energy facet with an outstanding stability
and is the second in the surface energy among the lowest-index planes
following an order of (110) > (001) > (100) > (101) with
their corresponding
surface energy of 1.09, 0.90, 0.53, and 0.44 J m–2, respectively.8 In addition, because
the nanocatalyst has unique Ti and O atoms arrangements, with the
Ti–O bond being relatively longer than that in other facets,
and higher density of five-coordinated Ti(001) facet surface atoms,
compared to the typical surface of (101) faceted TiO2,
its electron distribution density is loosely bound to the atoms. This
will result in abundance of energetic electrons that may be available
for charge-transfer activity and surface reactions. Various fields
of applications, such as photocatalysts, photovoltaics, photoelectrochemical
cell applications, hydrogen generation, water splitting, and so forth,
have been reported to be multiplied in efficiency when utilizing the
(001)-faceted TiO2 nanomaterial.9−14 Therefore, any efforts should be continuously demonstrated to realize
the anatase TiO2 nanocatalyst with the wide-area (001)
facet.

The efforts of synthesizing TiO2 with (001)
facets has
started since 2008 as reported by the Yang research group.15 To date, a wide range of approaches for the
synthesis of anatase TiO2 with such characteristics have
been available with most of them being centered on using of the fluorination
effect in projecting the (001) facet in the TiO2 nanostructure
(TNS).16−19 For example, the hydrothermal technique involving the addition of
hydroflouric acid into the TiO2 precursor, such as TiCl4, has successfully produced (001)-faceted solid surface TiO2 with a lateral size of up to 1 μm.20 The solvothermal technique for decomposing TiOF2 in the presence of tetrabutyl titanate, hydroflouric acid, and acetic
acid was found to be capable of producing hollow box TiO2 with an edge length of 500 nm.21 Still,
there are several methods opting not to include the presence of hydroflouric
acid during the reaction, such as reported by Cheng et al., where
by decomposing the titanium butoxide in the presence of concentrated
hydrochloric acid, solid TiO2 nanosheets with an edge length
as high as 200 nm can be obtained.22 Even
though such reported techniques have successfully realized (001) faceted
TiO2, the samples were mostly characterized by solid structures
and wider dimensions, that is, in the range of 100 nm up to micrometers
in size.23,24 With such solid structure characteristics
and bulklike dimensions, the surface area could be low and the unique
properties resulting from the quantum effect would also be unavailable
in nanostructures with such micrometer dimensions. Therefore, preparation
of TNSs with higher surface areas but maintaining their quantum characteristics,
such as wide-area and ultra-thin nanosheets, has been highly demanded.

In an earlier study, we found that the porous anatase TiO2 nanoplates that were grown vertically on a substrate surface resembling
a nanowall structure25 exhibited excellent
photocatalytic properties in the photodegradation of methylene blue.
The photocatalytic performance becomes extremely enhanced when the
nanoplate was doped with Zn. Here, we report the synthesis of porous,
two-dimensional (2D), hierarchical TNSs and the study of the role
of metal doping of different oxidation states in their photocatalytic
properties. It has been well-known that the oxidation state of a metal
dopant has a profound effect on the modification of the electron density
of state via electron donating and accepting with the dopant, improving
the oxygen vacancy and refinement of crystallinity in the metal oxides
nanocrystals, as well as reducing the electron–hole recombination
or facilitating a facile electron–hole separation that is useful
for promoting the active electron-transfer process for the highly
efficient photocatalytic process.26−30 In addition, the unique optical properties of metal
nanoparticles, such as localized surface plasmon resonance, acoustogyration,
and non-linear optical effects, are expected to intensely modify the
optical properties of the metal-oxide nanocrystals when being doped
with them.31−36 In this work, we achieved a high photocatalytic performance in a
rhodamine B degradation by using the Ag-doped TNS (AgTNS), which is
several order higher compared to the TNS doped with Zn or Al. In the
typical process, the AgTNS can degrade rhodamine B up to 91% within
only 120 min, which is equivalent to ToN and ToF of 94 and 1.57 min–1, respectively. An expanded crystallinity refinement
in the TNS nanocrystal lattice, which at the same time dramatically
lowers the valence state binding energy of TNS and provides the additional
dopant oxidation state into the system for enhanced electron-transfer
process and surface reaction, is assumed as the key factor for the
high photocatalytic performance in the AgTNS system. The synthetic
process and the photocatalytic performance of metal-doped TNSs will
be discussed.

Results and Discussion
AgTNS Characterization
During the growth process of
the AgTNS, the initial solution is colorless. The solution immediately
shows a greyish color with time elapsing. At 5 h of growth time, the
solution becomes colorless and greyish-white precipitates were obtained.
The morphology and the structure of the sample were then analyzed
using field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). Figure 1 shows the characteristic of the AgTNS morphology
prepared using a reaction containing 5 mL of 0.5 ammonium hexafluorotitanate,
1 mL of 0.5 hexamethylenetetramine (HMT), and 1 mL of 100 mM AgNO3. As can be seen in Figure 1, the morphology of the samples is a square-shaped
nanosheet with an edge length and a thickness of up to 5 μm
and 200 nm, respectively. As also can be seen in the Figure 1A–C, the nanosheet exhibits
a porous hierarchical structure in nature, which is composed of oriented
stacking of small nanocuboids of TiO2 of dimensions approximately
50 and 100 nm in length and width, which is similar to the structure
of the TiO2 nanowall that has been previously reported.25 However, here we found that the AgTNS is much
porous, brittle, and thinner. This is probably due to the existence
of an unique combinative effect of Ag and nitric ions from AgNO3 salt in the reaction, which is well-known as a strong reducing
agent that may induce surface oxidation or Ostwald annealing, generating
thinner nanosheet structures. It is also assumed that both Ag and
nitric ions may play adhesive role so that the wide open pore structure
of nanocuboid stacking can be possibly retained. Using different nitric
salts, such as zinc nitrate, aluminum nitrate, and so forth, may not
produce such a thin and porous nanosheet structure.

and Raman spectra.

To obtain the crystallinity
of the nanosheets, we carried out HRTEM
analysis. The results are shown in Figure 1D–F. To our surprise, despite the
nanosheet nanostructures being composed of stacked nanocuboids, it
is found that the nanosheets are single crystalline in nature because
of the presence of clear lattice fringes without twinning and dislocation.
Such a single crystalline nature is further verified by the selected-area
electron diffraction (SAED) analysis results. We calculated the lattice
spacing and it was found to be 0.24 nm, which belongs to the (001)
facet of anatase TiO2. SAED also confirmed the nature of
the (001) facet because of the presence of a square-shaped electron
diffraction pattern (see Figure 1E).

Because of the existence of Ag ions in the
reaction, the AgTNS
is expected to be produced as confirmed by X-ray powder diffraction
(XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, which will be discussed later. Nevertheless,
interestingly, judging from the high-resolution FESEM image, no nanostructures
related to Ag are observed on the nanosheet reflecting that the Ag
doping follow the substitutional doping process. However, at high
concentration Ag doping, for example, 150 and 200 mM, Ag nanoparticles
are visible on the surface of the nanosheet (Figure S1, Supporting Information). This could be due to
the supersaturation of doping of Ag onto the TiO2 nanosheet
lattice.

To confirm the phase crystallinity of the as-synthesized
nanosheets,
we carried out XRD spectroscopy analysis. Figure 1G shows the corresponding XRD spectrum for
the sample. XRD samples followed the standard XRD pattern for anatase
TiO2 (JCPDS file number 21-1272). The main peaks of anatase
TiO2 are observed at 25.28, 36.50, 37.80, 38.58, 48.05,
53.89, and 55.06°, which are associated with the lattice planes
of (101), (103), (004), (112), (200), (105), and (211), respectively.
Surprisingly, no peaks related to fcc Ag crystal are observed in this
spectrum, inferring that Ag ions successfully substituted into the
anatase TiO2 lattice. The doping process on the TNS is
likely confirmed by the existence of shifting in the main peaks toward
a higher angle, reflecting an effective stressing in the TNS lattice
upon the Ag-ion substitution. The shifting increases with the increasing
Ag doping concentration and is optimum at the TNS sample doped with
100 mM of Ag doping (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The Raman analysis result also further validates the successfulness
of the Ag doping into the TNS. As can be seen from the Raman spectrum
in Figure 1H, there
has been a shifting in the position of the main Raman peaks for TiO2, that is, Eg(1), Eg(2), and B1g mode (the peak
related to bridge oscillation of O–Ti–O bending) and
Eg(3) and A1g (Ti–O strain oscillation), to the
higher frequency upon doping with the Ag.37−39 This indicates
that the Ag doping effectively distorts the stoichiometry of the lattice
chemical composition and enhances the surface oxidation state due
to the improvement of the oxygen vacancy density and the decrease
in the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes.40 These results reveal that the Ag doping should
enhance the surface reactivity of the TNS. Similar to the XRD result,
the shifting increase with the increasing Ag doping content (Figure
S3, Supporting Information). Additional
verification on the doping process has also been carried via elemental
analysis using the EDX technique. The result is shown in Figure S4
(Supporting Information). As can be seen
in the figure, the Ag element along with the TiO2 component
with the atomic concentration approximately 0.3% is observed in the
spectrum. Elemental mapping composition on the sample further indicates
that the Ag element is homogenously distributed throughout the nanocrystal
(Figure S4). Nevertheless, at lower Ag
concentrations, that is, 25–50 mM, the Ag element cannot be
detected presumably because of the low percentage of Ag ion in the
TNS lattice. However, Raman spectra as shown in Figure S3 show a significant shifting in the Eg bands toward
higher frequency, indicating a lattice symmetry modification of which
is associated with the Ag doping.40 In
addition, from the EDX elemental analysis as shown in Table 1, there has been a decrease
in the impurity content, particularly the F element, when the TNS
was being doped with Ag. This could only occur when different impurities
share the binding sites with the F element, a strong evidence of the
Ag substitution into the TNS lattice. On the basis of these analysis
results, it is worthwhile remarked that the AgTNS has been successfully
realized.

We then
carried out XPS analysis on the sample to understand its
surface chemistry properties. The results are shown in Figure 2. As can be seen from the wide-range
scan result in Figure S5 (Supporting Information), binding energies related to the AgTNS elements, that is, Ti, O,
and Ag, are also observed along with F binding energy, which is related
to surface fluorination. This result is in good agreement with the
EDX elemental analysis result as shown in Figure S4. Other elements from the indium tin oxide (ITO) substrate,
such as Sn and In, are also obtained. To further understand the nature
of chemical bonding on the sample surface, we carried out high-resolution
scan on each element. A carbon correction at 284.5 eV was performed
on each high-resolution scan. For the case of the Ti element (Figure 2A), the binding energy
is split into two spin orbits at the energy of 458.81 and 464.52 eV
that correspond to Ti4+ 2p3/2 and Ti4+ 2p1/2, respectively. When compared to the pristine TNS
samples, the Ti 2p lattice peaks actually shift to a higher binding
energy. It is due to the fact that the electron density of Ti is lowered
upon being doped with Ag, confirming the successful doping of Ag into
the TiO2 lattice. The decrease in the electron density
in the Ti site may cause the decrease in the optical band gap energy
of the TNS, which in turn enhances the photoactivity of the samples.
Thus, the photocatalytic performance is expected to be improved. This
high-resolution scan spectrum is well-fitted by two Gaussian (G) curves
with the energy centered at 458.81 and 459.18 eV, which are associated
with the lattice (Ti–O) and Ti3+ binding energy,
respectively. The Ti3+ peak is mainly associated with the
binding energy for impurity or doping. Thus, in this case, this peak
could be due to the Ti–Ag binding energy. The area ratio is
relatively high, that is, 12% (see the shaded region under the curve
in Figure 2A). Nevertheless,
the Ti3+ peaks are much higher in the pristine TNS with
the area ratio as high as 15%. This is due to the nature of facile
bonding of impurities, such as F and N, onto the TNS lattice. However,
in the presence of Ag ions in the reaction, a better immiscibility
of Ag ions in the TiO2 lattice41 may overcome the other impurities binding to the lattice. Because
of a relatively high ionic radius of Ag, the intensity of the binding
energy band related to Ti–Ag becomes lower than that of the
pristine TNS samples. This has also been confirmed by the EDX elemental
analysis results as shown in Table 1, which shows the decreasing atomic percentage of the
F element in the EDX spectra upon the increase of the Ag doping concentration.
Meanwhile, regarding the oxygen (Figure 2B), its high-resolution scanning spectrum
can be well-fitted by three G curves that are centered at 529.99,
530.54, and 531.82 eV, which are attributed to lattice (OL), bridging (OB), and hydroxyl (OH) species
binding energies. Binding energy related to bridging can be associated
with the binding energy impurities, such as Ag–O and surface
fluorination, which also confirmed in the high-resolution scan of
F 1s binding energy as shown in Figure 2C. Its area ratio is as high as 16.57%. Similar to
the Ti impurity binding energy, the OB area intensity in
the pristine TNS sample is also higher than in the AgTNS, that is,
36.21%, which is attributed to F or N impurities chemical binding
energies. For the case of Ag, similar to Ti, its high-resolution scan
also consists of two spin orbit splitting with energy centered at
367.73 and 373.73 eV (see Figure 2D). It (Ag d5/2) can be again well-fitted
by three G curves that correspond to binding energy of impurities
(367.09 and 367.70 eV) and lattice (368.01 eV) with area ratios of
59 and 41%, respectively. The high area ratio of binding energy related
to impurities indicating the effective substitutional doping of Ag
into the TNS lattice. Owing to the effective substitutional doping
of Ag into the TNS lattice, it is expected that the AgTNS should have
much better photocatalytic activity compared to the pristine anatase
TiO2.

of the chemical state.

The optical properties of the TNS samples (Figure 3) changed with the doping of
Ag into the
TNS by presenting a meaningful alteration of the optical energy gap
of the TNS upon doping, that is, they decreased with the increase
of the doping concentration and reached a minimum at a doping concentration
of 100 mM with an optical band gap value of 3.28 eV. The optical energy
band gap then increases when the doping concentration further increases
above this value. The results are summarized in Table 1. It can be attributed to the doping supersaturation
effect that makes the Ag interstitially grow on the surface of the
TNS, as judged by the FESEM analysis in Figure S1.

Photocatalytic Characterization
The photocatalytic
properties of the porous, hierarchical AgTNS was evaluated by rhodamine
B (RhB) degradation under solar simulator light irradiation. Typical
absorption spectra of RhB during a photocatalytic degradation over
AgTNS with an Ag concentration of 100 mM is shown in Figure 4. As can be seen in the figure,
the characteristic absorption band of RhB centered at 550 nm rapidly
decreased with the increasing of the reaction time. From the concentration
calibration curve in Figure S6 (Supporting Information), it can be understood that the RhB concentration is effectively
reduced with the increasing reaction time and reduces up to 91% from
10 ppm (initial concentration) to 0.89 ppm for a reaction time of
120 min. The kinetic rate of the reaction was calculated to be as
high as 0.018 min–1. From the reaction kinetic plot,
it is discovered that the change in the RhB concentration is in general
linear with the reaction time, which follows the first-order reaction
kinetics. However, it can be divided into two different reaction kinetic
conditions, that is, high rate (approximately 0.031 m–1) at the beginning of the reaction up to 30 min and lower rate (0.021
m–1) at the longer reaction time. This could be
related to the fact of active site poisoning at longer reaction time,
causing a decrease in the reaction kinetic rate. Nevertheless, the
difference between the high reaction rate and the lower reaction rate
regions is not large, indicating that the AgTNS has a highly dynamic
surface chemical process and high active site chemical stability properties.
By considering the amount of AgTNS molarity used in the reaction,
we then calculated the turn-over-number (ToN) and turn-over-frequency
(ToF) of the reaction and the values as high as 94 and 1.57 m–1 were recorded for ToN and ToF, respectively. These
values are several order higher compared to those of the pristine
TNS sample, confirming the high photocatalytic performance of the
AgTNS.

Absorption spectra of rhodamine B during the photocatalytic degradation.
(B) Reaction kinetic rate of the photocatalytic degradation of rhodamine
B showing two regions of reaction kinetics (shaded region), that is,
high- and low-kinetic conditions.

Because of the fact that the photocatalytic degradation not
only
depends on the molarity of the catalyst system but also on the intensity
of the solar light source used during the reaction, we calculated
the efficiency of the reaction by considering both the factors. We
then found that the present sample demonstrated extremely high photocatalytic
performance with efficiency as high as 91.1 mg–1 W–1, which is double from that of the most recently
reported result (see Table 2).

Figure 4A shows
a typical plot of the reaction kinetic rate over AgTNS samples with
different Ag doping concentrations during the RhB photocatalytic degradation
reaction. It can be observed from the figure that the reaction kinetic
rate remarkably increases upon doping and is optimum at the Ag doping
concentration of 100 mM. The kinetic rate changes from 0.0069 on pristine
TNS to 0.0180 min–1 on the optimum AgTNS sample.
However, the photocatalytic performance gradually decreased when the
Ag doping concentration further increased above the optimum value.

There are several factors that influence the photocatalytic properties,
including the modification of surface chemistry, optical band gap,
surface morphology of the samples, and so forth. In the present study,
we remark that the modification of the surface chemistry and the optical
properties of the samples are the main reasons for the improvement
of the photocatalytic performance upon being doped with the Ag ion.
Pristine TNS, because of its unique (001) faceted and hierarchical
structure, readily demonstrates high photocatalytic performance in
the degradation of RhB. In our current study, the kinetic rate as
high as 0.0069 min–1 has been recorded for this
pristine TNS sample. Introduction of doping has modified and enhanced
the surface chemistry properties of the TNS because of the modification
of lattice symmetry and the electronics system, leading to a highly
active chemical reaction on their surface. According to the XPS analysis
result, there has been a significant shifting toward the lower energy
of the electrons in the Ti p3/2 state upon the introduction
of Ag ions into the lattice, suggesting that there has been an improvement
in the reactivity nature of the surface. However, when the doping
process involves an interstitial growth of Ag nanoparticles on the
TNS lattice, especially at high Ag concentrations (e.g., higher than
150 mM), the photocatalytic performance reduces. This is associated
with the deterioration of the surface active site by the Ag nanoparticle
interstitial growth, limiting the adsorption of the RhB molecules
onto the AgTNS surface and the surface reaction, trapping the photogenerated
electron, and accordingly, affecting the photocatalytic degradation
of RhB. Thus, the photocatalytic performance decreases. The presence
of the Ag metal dopant in the AgTNS may also contribute to formation
of much more electron trapping sites in the nanocrystal. This phenomenon
may facilitate the separation of electrons and holes and assist in
the electron-transfer process at the interface, promoting an active
photocatalytic process. In addition, the presence of the moderately
lower weight percentage of F atom in the AgTNS sample also drives
energetic photocatalytic activity when compared to the pristine TNS
with a high concentration of surface fluorination, which is normally
obtained on (001)-faceted TiO2 nanocrystals. The presence
of F atoms in the samples causes surface poisoning, limiting the formation
of OH• radicals that is beneficial for RhB degradation.
Therefore, decreasing the concentration of surface fluorination, which
is achieved in the AgTNS, may lead to higher catalytic activity.

The lowering in the optical band gap of the TNS upon being doped
with Ag could also be the reason for the performance improvement.
It was found that the optical band gap of the TNS significantly reduced
upon being doped with Ag where the optical band gap reduction increases
with the increasing Ag doping concentration and reaches optimum at
the AgTNS sample with the Ag precursor concentration of 100 mM (Figure
S5, Supporting Information). This changes
from 3.31 eV for pristine TNS to 3.28 eV for the optimum AgTNS samples.
Actually, the sample that are doped with higher Ag concentrations
also shows an appreciably decrease in their optical band gap. However,
because of other surface chemistry effects, that is, the disruption
of the surface active site by interstitial Ag nanoparticles growth
(see Figure S1, Supporting Information),
the sample with the high Ag doping concentration is much low in the
photocatalytic performance. Although in many cases, such interstitially
grown metallic nanoparticles may enhance the optical properties of
the host materials via metal catalytic48 or plasmonic effects,32 in the present
study it may behave as a trap to the photoexcited carriers, decreasing
the photocatalytic performance of the AgTNS.

The modification
of the morphology upon doping is also assumed
to generate a profound effect on the photocatalytic performance. As
has been discussed earlier, the structure becomes more porous upon
being doped with Ag (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). The improvement of the AgTNS porosity enhances
the surface interaction between the catalyst and the analytes. Thus,
the photocatalytic degradation of RhB is improved.

It has been
well-known that the electrical, optical, and surface
physicochemical properties of the TiO2 nanocrystals are
also determined by the metal dopant properties, particularly its ionic
radius and oxidation state.49 The use of
metals with different ionic radii and oxidation states may modify
the surface chemistry of the nanostructure because of the alteration
of oxygen vacancy either in bulk or surface of the anatase TiO2, increasing the uncoordinated-species (dangling bond) density
on the surface and the surface atom reconstruction. We prepared the
TNS doped with Zn and Al, and their FESEM image and XRD spectra are
shown in Figures S7 and S8 (Supporting Information). We compared the photocatalytic properties of AgTNS with Zn- and
Al-doped TNS to understand the role of metal doping type in the photocatalytic
properties of anatase TNS. We found that the AgTNS that contains Ag
dopants demonstrates the highest photocatalytic efficiency and followed
by Zn and Al. The results are shown in Figure 5B. It has been acclaimed that the number
of oxidation states of the metal dopant may either stabilize or destabilize
the host material lattice via the lattice symmetry distortion, which
in turn modify the electron density of state of the host material.
Similar effect is assumed to be valid for the case of ionic radii
in the modification of the surface physicochemistry properties. The
larger the dopant ionic size, immense the lattice symmetry distortion
is, and thus, the greater the modification of the surface electronic
density of state. XPS analysis result verifies such phenomena as the
shifting in the chemical species state binding energy as well as the
modification of the chemical states in both Ti and O (Figure 6). For example, the shifting
to the higher energy in Ti chemical state binding energy is observed
in the AgTNS sample, whereas to the lower binding energy for ZnTNS
and AlTNS. A similar case is also observed in the O chemical state
binding energy, in the O species, the binding energy related to bridging
and hydroxyl chemical states also demonstrates shifting its energy
to the higher energy region when the TNS doped with Ag and otherwise
when being doped with Zn and Al. Different with the Ti site, the energy
shifting in the O bridging and hydroxyl chemical states are also high
in the metal dopant with low oxidation state (see Table S1, Supporting Information). However, for the case
of Al, energy shifting in the hydroxyl chemical state is the highest.
This infers that the Al has high tendency to form its own oxide, that
is, Al2O3, which may deteriorate the photocatalytic
performance of the TNS system. Raman analysis results further confirm
such a variation effect in the host properties when using metal dopants
with different oxidation states and the ionic radii. As the Raman
results reveal, the main peaks of the host lattice vibration shifted
to the higher frequency upon being doped with the metal with the highest
shift was shown by the Ag doping. The shifting to the higher frequency
domain indicates the improvement in the crystallinity by decreasing
the crystal defects. It is also related to the increase of the oxygen
vacancy on the material surface. In addition, for the case of Ag doping,
the band symmetry (see Eg(1) band) is strongly altered, which reveals
the existence of phonon confinement in the lattice presumably because
of an immense distortion in the crystal lattice symmetry modifying
the O–Ti–O or Ti–O vibration and bending nature.
Combination of the high crystallinity degree and immense lattice symmetry
distortion in Ag doping may lead to the decrease in the photoelectron
and hole recombination and the enhancement of the photogenerated carrier
formation, enhancing the photocatalytic performance of the TNS (Figure 7).

Conclusions
Hierarchical, porous, and high-energy faceted
AgTNS demonstrates
high photocatalytic performance in the degradation of the RhB dye
with ToN and ToF as high as 94 and 1.57 min–1, respectively,
and equivalent to the degradation of 91.1 mmol mg–1 W–1. The result also indicates that the AgTNS
performance is 2 times higher than the pristine TNS and several order
higher compared to Zn- and Al-doped TNS as well as compared to the
recently reported result. The main reason for the high photocatalytic
performance is due to (i) the improvement of the crystallinity degree
of the TNS, (ii) decrease of the defect density and the photogenerated
electron and hole recombination, and (iii) increase of the oxygen
vacancy upon being doped with the Ag ions. The hierarchical and porous
(001) faceted metal-doped TNS should find an extensive application
in a wide range of fields, such as dye-sensitized solar cells, photoelectrochemical
water splitting, sensors, and so forth, and its performance is predicted
to be upgradable by improving their bulk and surface chemistry properties,
such as crystallinity and surface refinement.

Materials and Method
Synthesis
of the Two-Dimensional AgTNS
Two-dimensional,
hierarchical, porous AgTNS or simply called as AgTNS nanosheets were
prepared using our previously reported method, namely, liquid phase
deposition method with a modification.25 In the normal process, AgTNS was prepared by mixing 1 mL of 100
mM AgNO3, 5 mL of aqueous solution of 0.5 M (NH4)2TiF6, and 1 mL of 0.5 M HMT altogether. The
solution was then ultrasonicated for 2 min for a better mixing the
solution. After that, the mixed solution was kept undisturbed for
5 h in a water bath at a temperature of 90 °C. A white precipitate
was obtained from this process and collected via centrifugation at
400 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was removed using a micropipette,
and the white powder precipitate was then transferred to an alumina
crucible. The sample was then transferred into the furnace for drying
and then annealed at 400 °C for 1 h in air. From this process,
anatase AgTNS will be obtained.

To obtain AgTNS with different
Ag contents, five different concentrations of Ag(NO3)2, that is, 25, 50, 100, 150, and 200 mM, were used. The effect
of the metal dopant on the photocatalytic performance of the TNS,
two more metal dopants, that is, Zn and Al, were used in this study.
For the preparation of ZnTNS and AlTNS, the ZnNO3·xH2O and Al2 (NO3)3·9H2O were introduced into the growth solution
instead of AgNO3.

AgTNS Characterization
The morphology
of AgTNS was
characterized using the FESEM technique (Zeiss MERLIN). The crystallinity
of the nanosheet sample was analyzed using a S/TEM FEI Tecnai G2 F20
operated at 200 kV acceleration voltage. The elemental composition
of AgTNS and its distribution was also analyzed using the same apparatus
via the electron energy dispersion technique using Aztech Instruments
with an acceleration voltage of 15 kV. The crystal structure and the
phase of the AgTNS were characterized using the XRD technique using
Bruker D8 with Cu Kα of 1.54 Å with a scan rate of as 2°/min.
While the optical properties and the surface chemistry of the samples
were characterized by the diffuse reflectance method using a Hitachi
U39000-H spectrophotometry system and a XPS Shimadzu XSAM-HS system
from Kratos, UK, with monoenergetic X-ray of Al Kα (1486.6 eV),
respectively. For these XPS and diffuse reflectance spectroscopy,
we used the samples grown on the ITO surface. Measurement of Raman
spectroscopy was also carried out on samples prepared on the ITO surface
using confocal micro-Raman imaging spectroscopy, Thermo Scientific
(model DX2Xi), with 532 nm laser line of Ar+ laser used
as an excitation source.

Photocatalytic Characterization
The photocatalytic
property of AgTNS was examined in the photodegradation of rhodamine
B under solar light illumination. Solar light simulation 1.5 AM 100
mW cm–1 was obtained from an LCT-100 Newport solar
simulator, USA. In the photocatalytic degradation study, 10 mL of
10 ppm rhodamine B in aqueous phase was used and prepared in a 30
mL glass vial. AgTNS (1 mg) was then added into the solution and briefly
ultrasonicated for 5 s. The solution that contained AgTNS was then
put under solar light simulator irradiation. The degradation kinetics
of rhodamine B was evaluated by analyzing its optical absorbance in
every 10 min of the reaction.
