Hydrogen can be produced by photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting
using a KOH solution as an electrolyte and TiO2 as a photoanode.
In this work, we fabricated anatase TiO2 nanoring/nanotube
arrays and TiO2 nanotube arrays using an anodic oxidation
method, confirmed by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM)
and X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and then conducted the photoelectrochemical
experiments with 1 M KOH and Na2SO4 solutions.
The bias voltage, small impedance, negative flat-band potential, large
capacitance, and depletion layer width in the anatase TiO2–KOH system were observed, leading to the stable and large
photocurrent density. To understand the effects of KOH on the interface
properties of TiO2/H2O, the electric double
layers of anatase TiO2(001), (100), (101)/KOH interfaces
were further investigated by calculating the ion–surface interaction
with molecular dynamics simulations. It is noted that the number density
of potassium ions has the same trend as that of oxygen atoms due to
the layering effect in liquids and the strongest ionic hydration of
K+ on anatase (101) is observed by analyzing the radial
distribution function and coordination number. In addition, the electrostatic
characteristics along the TiO2/KOH interfaces were analyzed
based on the Grahame double layer model. The potential drops in the
outer Helmholtz layer of anatase (001), (100), and (101) surfaces
are 1.08, 0.26, and 0.51 V, respectively. Compared with TiO2–H2O systems, the larger potential drops in the
TiO2–KOH system explain the phenomenon that KOH
solute contributes substantially to a chemical bias in PEC reactions.
At the same time, we estimated the depletion layer widths of anatase
TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces as 37.48, 173.25,
and 64.49 Å, respectively, which are of similar magnitude to
the experimental results. Anatase TiO2(100) with the widest
depletion layer is suggested in photocatalysis. These works provide
a clear understanding of interfacial behavior of KOH on anatase TiO2 from a microscale, which can be used to explain the promotion
effect of the KOH electrolyte and guide the design of TiO2 nanocrystals in the PEC system.

==== Body
1 Introduction
TiO2 is regarded
as one of the popular photoanode materials
for solar water splitting into hydrogen and oxygen. Apart from the
experimental studies,1−4 there are a few theoretical research works that shed light on the
electronic structures, thermodynamics of protonation and deprotonation,
photocatalytic mechanism, and electron transfer in the process.5−8 Moreover, more attention has been paid to the photoelectrode/electrolyte
interface. The semiconductor surfaces acquire charge in solution,
and then, the charge is balanced by oppositely charged counterions,
forming an electric double layer (EDL). Foissy and his colleagues9 determined the charge density of the double layer
at the TiO2–electrolyte interface using complementary
techniques, assuming that the double layer is represented by a series
of capacitors. Sumita et al.10 found that
water molecules around the interface between TiO2 and bulk
water can be described by a two-layer model, which well accounts for
the experimental results. Liu et al.11 reported
density functional theory simulations of liquid water on rutile (110)
that show that the aqueous film is layered, with slow-moving molecules
in the contact layer and fast-moving molecules in the second layer.
Futera and English12 investigated static/structural
and dynamic properties of anatase (101) and rutile (110) interfaces
with liquid bulk water. A layered, well-organized structure of water
in the interface region was clearly observed within 6.5 Å.

Within these contexts, several theoretical continuum models against
the solution side of the interface about potential distribution have
been developed. In the early time, a parallel plate capacitor model
was proposed by Helmholtz.13 Then, the
Gouy–Chapman model, Stern model, and Grahame double layer model
were developed by taking electrostatic interaction, particle size,
and ion-specific adsorption into account, respectively. In 2004, Předota
et al.14 studied the adsorption of Rb+, Na+, Sr2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ on the rutile (110) surface and found that part of ions
formed a diffuse Gouy–Chapman layer. In 2006, Köppen
and Langel15 simulated the interface of
the rutile (100) surface with the NaCl solution, which confirmed that
the Stern model is a rigid compact layer of the adsorbed counterions
on the charged TiO2 surface and a diffused Gouy–Chapman
layer. Furthermore, the measurement of the rutile (110)–RbOH
solution interface proved that the counterions are not a single layer
in the adsorptive state but a diffusion layer.16 In 2007, Ishimatsu et al.17 studied
the surface charge densities of the LiCl solution at different concentrations
within the framework of the Stern–Grahame model.

KOH
is commonly used as an electrolyte in the photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water splitting system.18,19 Cachet and Sutter found
that under UV light illumination the surface of TiO2 is
relatively stable at basic pH but strongly modified (hydroxylation)
at neutral pH.20 Camposeco et al.21 obtained a similar result that TiO2 nanotubes show notable photocatalytic activity at alkaline medium
(pH 9). Grinter et al.22 investigated the
behavior of ultralow coverages of potassium in the {K + H2O}/TiO2(110) systems and draw the conclusion that potassium
adatoms can facilitate the dissociation of water, forming (OH)–K
units with very low mobility on the TiO2(110) substrate.
On the other hand, the structural and dynamic properties of water
have significantly changed with the addition of hydroxide, preferring
the OH–(H2O)4 structure at
low concentrations of KOH.23 It is observed
that the research works about TiO2 with the KOH electrolyte
are mainly carried out through experiments. Herein, we use classical
molecular dynamics to simulate the dynamic process of K+ and OH– on the TiO2 surface, which
is more conducive to further understand the interfacial behavior from
a microscale. In addition, the electric double layer of KOH and the
depletion layer of TiO2 have received much less attention
from a molecular simulation point of view. Care must be taken since
this can be used to understand the enhanced photoelectrochemical performance
in alkali solution than neutral solution.

From the three main
polymorphs of titania occurring naturally (rutile,
anatase, and brookite), anatase is the most active one and used abundantly.
In our previous work,24,25 the interfaces of anatase (001),
(100), and (101) with pure water and anatase (001) with the KOH solution
were studied using classical molecular dynamics calculations. Based
on these works, the structure and electrostatic characteristics of
anatase (001), (100), and (101) in 1 M KOH solution have been discussed
in this paper. Toward the TiO2–H2O system,
the Gouy–Chapman model was suitable for analyzing the interface
energy at the solution side, while the Grahame model should be used
for the TiO2–KOH system due to the charged interface
in the alkaline medium.25,26 Then, the depletion
layer width was calculated. Before that, we prepared one-dimensional
TiO2 nanoring/nanotube (RT) arrays and TiO2 nanotube
(NT) arrays on Ti foils via an anodization process and their photocurrent,
capacitance, impedance, flat-band potential, interfacial donor density,
and depletion layer width were compared with those of 1 M KOH and
Na2SO4 as electrolytes to study the role of
KOH in photocatalytic water splitting. This investigation, obtained
by molecular dynamics simulations and PEC experiments of the strong
interactions between TiO2 and KOH, can provide suggestive
messages for the design of reactive photocatalytic TiO2 nanocrystals.

2 Computational Methods
The three-dimensional models of anatase (001), (100), (101)–KOH
were prepared and are described in Table 1. Bulk anatase TiO2 has lattice
vectors a0 = b0 = 3.776 Å, c0 = 9.486 Å and
symmetry group I41/amd, which is tetragonal. All surfaces were constructed by cleaving
the anatase TiO2 supercell. For the diluted KOH solution,
the initial configuration was generated from an equilibrated configuration
of 60 K+, 60 OH–, and 2400 H2O molecules. Water is assumed to be adequately represented by the
SPC model, which assigns partial charges to oxygen, qO = −0.82e, and hydrogen, qH = +0.41e (e being the elementary charge).27 The OH– ion was created by removing one hydrogen atom from
an H2O molecule. The z dimensions of the
supercells were chosen to accommodate 2400 H2O molecules
of bulk density 1 g/cm3, and the lengths were long enough
(>50 Å) to remove the effect of TiO2 on the bulk
solution.
The vacuum thicknesses against all slabs were set as 20 Å to
eliminate the interaction between the periodically replicated cells.

The classical molecular dynamics
simulations were performed in
the canonical ensemble (NVT) at 298 K in conjunction with a Nosé–Hoover
thermostat. Based on our previous confirmations, it is regarded that
the condensed-phase optimized molecular potentials for atomistic simulation
studies (COMPASS) force field can well describe the configurations
of the TiO2–H2O system, in which the
system energy can be written as eq 1 1  

The potential functions are divided into valence terms, including
the diagonal and off-diagonal cross-coupling terms and the nonbond
interaction terms. The valence terms include Eb, Eθ, E⌀, and Eφ for
bond, angle, torsion, and out-of-plane angle coordinates, respectively,
and Ebb′, Ebθ, Eb⌀, Eθθ′, and Eθθ′⌀ for cross-coupling terms between internal coordinates. Eelec is a Coulombic function for an electrostatic interaction,
and ELJ is an LJ-9-6 function of the van
der Waals.

To verify that the established KOH model and applied
force field
are rational, molecular dynamics simulation of the KOH solution was
conducted with a time step of 1 fs and a simulation time of 500 ps. Figure 1 displays the radial
distribution functions (RDFs) of K+–H2O and K+–Ow in the KOH solution. The
peak position of gion-H2O(r) is about 2.82 Å, which is in the range
of the standard value (2.65–2.92 Å).28 The effective ionic radius is the difference between the
first peak position of the radial distribution function of ion-oxygen
and the effective radius of H2O. The effective radius of
H2O is 1.38 Å. The first peak position of gK+–Ow(r), shown in Figure 1b, is 2.53 Å. Thus, the effective ionic radius of K+ was calculated as 1.15 Å, which is close to the Pauling radius
of 1.33 Å.29 In addition, the first
minimum of gK+–Ow(r) is shallow and the principal maximum shows
a distinct shoulder that delineates a second population of H2O molecules beyond the inner-most water molecules, explained in ref (30). Above all, it is regarded
that the COMPASS force field can well describe the TiO2–KOH system with the established KOH model.

(subscript w represents water).

The Ewald summation methods were used for long-range electrostatic
interactions with a cutoff distance of 18.5 Å. The total simulation
time was 2.4 ns with a 1.2 fs time step. All molecular dynamics simulations
were based on the periodic boundary in two dimensions. The structural
optimization of TiO2–KOH systems with the energy-minimum
structures and random initial velocities were determined by a steepest
descent method and a conjugate gradient method. In the process, the
lowest trilayers of TiO2 were kept frozen, while the rest
of the atoms were allowed to relax their atomic positions fully. Afterward,
the dynamical properties were statistically analyzed on the basis
of the trajectories built from configurations separated by 0.6 ps
and collected during the equilibration time. All calculations presented
in this work were performed using the Forcite program package in Materials
Studio 7.0.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Role of the KOH Electrolyte
in PEC Water Splitting
3.1.1 Surface Morphologies,
Crystalline Phases,
and Optical Properties of RT and NT Electrodes
Figure 2a shows the images of the as-synthesized
TiO2 nanoring/nanotube arrays (left) and TiO2 nanotube arrays (right). The hierarchical structure RT consists
of a ring-shaped top and a tubular bottom. The nanotubes with an average
diameter of 30 nm are randomly distributed inside every nanoring with
a diameter of 100 nm. NT has a highly ordered one-dimensional nanotube
structure whose tube diameter is approximately 80 nm. During the preparation,
calcination at 450 °C can crystallize the film on Ti foil. X-ray
diffractometry (XRD) patterns of RT and NT confirm the existence of
anatase TiO2 (JCPDS 21-1272) and titanium (JCPDS 44-1294).
To obtain the optical properties of the resulting samples, the UV–vis
diffusion reflectance spectra were measured and are shown in Figure 2b. The major absorption
region of them at wavelengths lower than 380 nm is ascribed to the
intrinsic band gap absorption of TiO2. The absorption intensity
of NT is almost higher than that of RT in the whole scope. Additionally,
it is notable that RT presents oscillating peaks with a certain frequency
and amplitude in the visible light region due to its special structure.

electron microscopy and X-ray diffractometry images
and (b) absorption spectra of TiO2 nanoring/nanotube (RT)
arrays/TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays.

3.1.2 Photocurrent Densities of RT and NT Electrodes
in KOH and Na2SO4 Solutions
Figure 3 depicts the photocurrent
density–time curves (I–t) of RT and NT electrodes under AM 1.5 illumination (100 mW/cm2) in 1 M KOH and Na2SO4 aqueous solutions.
At 0 V vs Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent densities of RT-KOH, RT-Na2SO4, NT-KOH, and NT-Na2SO4 are 0.42, 0.24, 0.21, and 0.12 mA/cm2, respectively.
Whether in KOH or Na2SO4, the RT electrode exhibits
larger photocurrent density. The photocurrent densities corresponding
to the KOH solution are almost 2 times those of Na2SO4. In 1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte with 1 V
vs Ag/AgCl, the photocurrent densities of RT and NT are 0.40 and 0.22
mA/cm2, respectively, which are in accordance with the
results of KOH. Also, the I–t curves with applied bias at the moment of “light on”
get smoother and steadier. Therefore, K+ and OH– ions not only provide bias voltage for the photoelectrochemical
reaction but also stabilize the reaction on the TiO2 electrode
at the same time.

(RT) arrays and (b) TiO2 nanotube (NT) arrays in 1 M KOH
and Na2SO4 electrolytes with or without a bias
of 1 V.

3.1.3 Electrochemical
Impedance
Figure 4 shows the Nyquist
plots of imaginary impedance versus real impedance recorded at 10–1–104 Hz. Generally, a smaller radius
corresponds to a lower charge-transfer resistance. An equivalent circuit
(inset of Figure 4)
is used to fit the data, wherein Rs serves
as the solution resistance, CPE is the constant-phase element, and Rct represents the charge-transfer resistance.
The electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)-fitted parameters
extracted from Nyquist plots of RT-KOH, RT-Na2SO4, NT-KOH, and NT-Na2SO4 are shown in Table 2. The Rs of RT-KOH (NT-KOH) is smaller than that of RT-Na2SO4 (NT-Na2SO4), yielding
faster charge transfer. Furthermore, the small arc radii of RT and
NT in KOH correspond to the low Rct values,
indicating the fast charge transport at the TiO2/KOH interface.

(RT) arrays and TiO2 nanotube (NT)

3.1.4 Flat-Band Potential, Interfacial Donor Density,
and Depletion Layer Width
The flat-band potential, Ufb, is the potential that is imposed over the
electrode/electrolyte interface to make the energy band flat, which
has an important effect on the interfacial electron transfer.3 Here, Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were used
to probe the flat-band potential at 3000 Hz, as shown in Figure 5. In the plots, the
flat-band potential approximately equals the voltage obtained at the
intersection of the tangents of the Mott–Schottky curves with
the horizontal potential axis. In KOH, the flat-band potentials of
RT and NT are −0.58 and −0.66 V, respectively; in Na2SO4, the flat-band potentials of RT and NT are
−0.50 and −0.57 V, respectively. The samples in KOH
exhibit more negative flat-band potentials, indicating lower energy
barriers for interfacial electron transfer.

Figure 5 Mott–Schottky
plots showing the flat-band potential of TiO2 nanoring/nanotube
(RT) arrays and TiO2 nanotube
(NT) arrays with 3000 Hz test frequency in 1 M KOH and Na2SO4 electrolytes.

In the case of an n-type semiconductor, the electrons are depleted
in the depletion layer of TiO2. Its width is inversely
proportional to the reverse square of the carrier concentration, which
is calculated as 2  where ε0 is the
vacuum permittivity
(8.854 × 10–12 F/m), εr is
the relative dielectric constant of pure anatase TiO2 (83.6),31U is the applied external potential, UFB is the flat-band potential, and ND is the donor density. The donor density at room temperature
of a flat oxide layer can be estimated from the Mott–Schottky
plots using eq 3 3  where Csc is the
capacitance of the depletion layer and k and T represent the Boltzmann constant (1.38 × 10–23 J/K) and temperature, respectively. At room temperature, the value
of kT/e is negligible. As shown
in Figure 5, the slopes k for RT-KOH, RT-Na2SO4, NT-KOH, and
NT-Na2SO4 are 1.29 × 1010, 8.8
× 108, 5.26 × 1010, and 3.35 ×
109 F–2·cm4·V–1, respectively. Applying the slope k (=2/(εrε0eND)), the interfacial donor densities of RT-KOH, RT-Na2SO4, NT-KOH, and NT-Na2SO4 were
calculated as 1.31 × 1020, 1.92 × 1021, 3.21 × 1019, and 5.04 × 1020 cm–3, respectively. Once ND is known, the depletion layer widths were estimated as 63.47 Å
for RT-KOH, 15.42 Å for RT-Na2SO4, 136.96
Å for NT-KOH, and 32.11 Å for NT-Na2SO4. The wider depletion layer of anatase TiO2 in KOH results
in the longer lifetime of the charge carriers and bigger capacitance
in the depletion layer, causing greater photocatalytic activity. It
is notable that the photoelectric properties of the systems with different
electrodes are codetermined by the light absorption and interfacial
properties in the electrolyte–electrode region. Therefore,
the depletion layer widths of RT and NT have a different order from
that of their photocurrent densities (Figure 3). To deeply analyze the effect of the interaction
between KOH and TiO2 on the photocatalytic reaction, we
further completed the molecular dynamics simulations of anatase (001),
(100), (101)–KOH systems from a microscale.

3.2 State of K+ on the Anatase (001),
(100), and (101) Surfaces
3.2.1 Ionic Hydration and Ionic
Radius
The radial distribution functions (RDFs) of K+–H2O, shown in Figure 6a, exhibit a similar tendency for anatase
(001), (100), and
(101) surfaces, and their first peaks are located at 3.39, 3.42, and
3.37 Å, respectively. All of them are larger than 2.82 Å,
shown in Figure 1a,
due to the electrostatic force between K+/OH– ions and TiO2. The smallest value of the (101) surface
means that the distance of K+–H2O is
the shortest, i.e., potassium ionic hydration on the (101) surface
is the strongest, followed by that on (001) and (100). In addition,
the high and pointed peak of the RDF diagram of anatase (101) indicates
that the arrangement of water molecules around potassium atoms is
relatively regular. The ionic hydration in the solution not only affects
the ions’ short-range structure but also changes the diffusivity.29 If the ionic hydration is strong, the diffusion
of ions is limited due to the inhibition of surrounding water molecules.
Thus, the diffusion coefficient of K+ ions on the anatase
(101) surface is the smallest. There are second peaks at about 6.5
Å, which originate from the two hydrogen atoms of H2O molecules, which are corresponding to the smaller peaks in Figure 1a. The radial distribution
functions of K+–Ow on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces are shown in Figure 6b. The first peaks are located
at 3.06, 3.11, and 3.10 Å, respectively. They are slightly higher
than the internuclear distances of K–O (2.79 ± 0.08 Å),28 caused by the difference of potential function
and force field applied in simulations.

Figure 6 Radial distribution functions
of (a) K+–H2O and (b) K+–Ow on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces.

3.2.2 Coordination Number of
K+
The coordination number, nij(r), defined as the number of ions that
are close to a contrary
sign ion, was calculated by integrating the radial distribution function, gij(r), as shown in eq 4 4  where i and j represent different
particles and ρ is the number density
of j in the bulk. The formula gives the relationship
between the distance and the coordination numbers of i and j.

The coordination numbers of K+ on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces
in the first coordination layer are calculated according to the first
peak position in Figure 6a and displayed in Figure 7, which are 0.85, 0.80, and 0.94, respectively. The largest
coordination number of K+ on the anatase (101) surface
means more water molecules around K+ ions, and the result
is consistent with the above analysis on ionic hydration (Figure 6a).

Figure 7 Coordination numbers
of K+ on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101)
surfaces.

3.2.3 Adsorption
Sites of K+
Understanding the structure and thermodynamics
of K+ is
crucial in dissecting its role in interface properties. Figure 8 shows the snapshots of the
computational KOH solution on anatase (001), (100), and (101) surfaces
at 1500 ps. As seen from the vertical view, we can get the structure
of the three surfaces. The anatase (001) surface has a flat plane
connected by alternating rows of undercoordinated fivefold-coordinated
titanium atoms Ti5c and twofold-coordinated O2c atoms. O2c atoms and threefold-coordinated O3c atoms are presented on the anatase (100) surface. Moreover, O3c atoms with fully coordinated Ti6c atoms, which
lie at the bottom of the grooves along the x-direction,
are exposed. The anatase (101) surface exhibits a zigzag-like structure
formed by O3c bonded to Ti6c and O2c bonded to Ti5c.

Figure 8 Snapshots of the computational H2O molecules and K+ and OH– ions on anatase
TiO2(001), (100), and (101) at 1500 ps in top view (left)
and vertical
view (right) and K+ adsorbed at different sites (A1, A2,
and A3). Oxygen, red balls; potassium, purple balls; and titanium,
gray balls.

The chemical adsorption structures
of K+ are sensitive
to the oxygen atoms at TiO2 surfaces. For example, Calzado
et al. demonstrated that the most stabilized status of K+ on the rutile TiO2(110) surface is bound to two bridge
oxygen atoms.32 There are three adsorption
sites of K+ on the anatase (001) surface. Most of the potassium
ions are adsorbed between two bridging oxygen atoms (A1), forming
two bonds. A few are adsorbed directly on bridging oxygen atom or
around it (A2/A3). Two types of adsorbed K+ can be recognized
on the anatase (100) facet. One is between three-coordinated oxygen
atoms and the bridging oxygen atom at the top of the grooves (A1)
with four bonds. The other (A2) is closer to one bridging oxygen atom,
forming three bonds with two surrounding bridging oxygen atoms. Three
adsorption types of K+ are recognized on the anatase (101)
facet. First is the K+ interacting with two bridging oxygen
atoms (A1) by two bonds. The second is K+ absorbed on terminal
oxygen atoms (A2) bonding with another bridging oxygen atom. The last
one is directly adsorbed on bridging oxygen atoms (A3). These adsorption
sites of K+ are similar to those of the other cations.
At pH 8, Zn2+ is found to adsorb at two different sites,
i.e., monodentate above the bridging O site and bidentate between
two neighboring terminal O sites.33 Rb+, Na+, Sr2+, and Ca2+ occupy
the tetradentate site and come into contact with two terminal and
two bridging oxygen atoms. With a comprehensive picture of the interface
between aqueous solutions and anatase TiO2 surface, cations
are bonded directly to surface oxygen atoms, while the specific binding
geometry and reaction stoichiometry are dependent on the ionic radius
and external conditions.14,34

3.2.4 Number Density of Oxygen Atoms and Potassium
and Hydroxyl Ions
The number density distributions of oxygen
atoms (Ow) and potassium/hydroxyl ions (K+/OH–) are shown in Figure 9. Předota et al. confirmed that the structural
and dynamic properties at the interfaces recovered within about 15
Å from the surface.35,36 Therefore, the results
in the range of 0–16 Å are displayed. The first peaks
of oxygen atoms on anatase (001), (100), and (101) surfaces are about
2.35, 2.70, and 1.76 Å, respectively. With the increase in distance,
the number densities gradually converge to 30 nm–3 in the bulk region.

Figure 9 Number density distribution of Ow and K+/OH– on anatase TiO2(001), (100),
and (101)
surfaces with the enlarged drawings of K+  and OH– ions shown in the inset. The distance is measured
from the average position of the topmost Ti atom layer on the surface.

The dynamics of the potassium ions are strongly
dominated by the
layered structure of water and the oxygen atoms at TiO2 surfaces.37 Thus, the number densities
of K+ have the same trends with oxygen atoms, ascribing
to the layering effect. The first peaks of K+ on anatase
TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces are located at about
2.27, 1.28, and 1.76 Å, respectively. In the bulk region, the
number densities of K+ tend to be zero because the cations
are mostly located at the surface, which is also observed in the literature.38 During K+ and H2O coadsorption,
a potassium hydroxide film grows, inducing a reduction of the work
function, which was recorded by Irkha.39 However, OH– does not form a surface characteristic
adsorption layer shown in the inset. It is explained that TiO2 is an n-type semiconductor and the surface states are available
for electron trapping, causing a negatively charged surface.40 Accordingly, K+ cations are mostly
found in the interface location, while OH– ions
are asymmetrically distributed in the bulk, controlled by repulsive
force.

3.3 Electrostatic Properties
of Anatase TiO2/KOH Interfaces
3.3.1 Charge
and Electric Field Distributions
Given that the water molecules
and potassium and hydroxyls ions
are redistributed in the dynamics process, the charge repartition
has happened. The electron density at the anatase TiO2 surface
was reversibly tuned by alkali-based adsorbates, affecting the charge-transfer
processes and chemical reactions induced by the K 4s electrons.32 Here, the profiles of charge distribution σ(z) across the molecule layer are calculated according to
hydrogen, oxygen, and potassium atomic densities and illustrated in Figure 10a. The charge distribution
profiles exhibit pronounced oscillation in the near-surface and then
gradually decay to 0 e/Å3 at 6 Å away from the
interfaces.

Figure 10 (a) Charge (σ(z)) and (b) electric
field
(E(z)) distributions of KOH solutions
on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces.

The electric field, E(z), in
the direction perpendicular to the surface is usually calculated by
using the following Poisson equation 5  

The integration was done numerically
from the middle of the bulk
water region (zbulk) to the TiO2 surface with the boundary condition E(zbulk) = 0.

In Figure 10b,
the electric fields near anatase (001), (100), and (101) surfaces
change from −0.35 to 1 V/Å. The order of the maximum electric
field intensity is 0.92 V/Å for (001), 0.78 V/Å for (101),
and 0.60 V/Å for (100). As for the second peak, the values for
(001) and (101) are obviously larger than that for (100) surface (0
V/m). The extraordinary strong field is an indicator of strong adsorption
on the TiO2 surface and large charge changes occurring
in this region.

3.3.2 Electrostatic Potential
Drop and Grahame
Double Layer Model of TiO2/KOH Interfaces
The
electrostatic potential distribution of the semiconductor/electrolyte
interface is essential for understanding the photoelectric behavior
of the semiconductor electrodes and electrolytes.38 Therefore, we further calculated the electrostatic potential,
φ(z), by eq 6 6  

Figure 11 shows the electrostatic potential distribution
of KOH solutions on anatase (001), (100), and (101) surfaces. With
the increase in distance, the potential on anatase (101) reaches a
stable value at 6.5 Å, which is quite consistent with the results
calculated by reactive force fields in ref (12). Thus, the structures and methods in the simulation
are proved to be reasonable once again. Well, an interesting phenomenon
is that the potential on the anatase (001) surface decreases continuously
until it reaches 0 V, while the potential on anatase (100) first decreases
and then rebounds to 0 V. Similar great variations of surface potential
can be found in ref (41).

Figure 11 Electrostatic potential distribution (φ(z))
of KOH solutions on anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101)
surfaces and the Grahame model. IHL (OHL) represents the inter (outer)
Helmholtz layer. d and VH are the width and potential drop of the outer Helmholtz layer, respectively.

For the TiO2–H2O system,
the Gouy–Chapman
model is used to satisfy the electronic double layer and the ions
controlled by the electrostatic attraction and heat movement are distributed
around surfaces by the Boltzmann formula. Here, the specific adsorption
of K+ has greatly changed the potential distribution in
the interface region, thus affecting the rate of chemical reaction
on the TiO2 surface. To make a reasonable analysis, a new
interpretation of these results was proposed. Taking ref (42) as a reference, the simulation
results are captured with the Grahame model by dividing the interface
region into three zones (Figure 11): the inner Helmholtz layer (IHL) in which the K+ ions population is dependent on the TiO2 surface
and almost no OH– ions in there, the outer Helmholtz
layer (OHL) that hosts a population of K+ plus a handful
of OH– whose population is described by a Langmuir
adsorption model,41 and the diffuse layer
where the ion distribution is well described using the Poisson–Boltzmann
theory. From Figure 11, the potential drops, VH, in the Helmholtz
layer of anatase TiO2(001), (100), and (101) are 1.08,
0.26, and 0.51 V, respectively, corresponding to the Helmholtz layer
widths of 3.63, 4.04, and 2.95 Å. Compared with that of the pure
water system (0.14 V of anatase (001)–H2O, 0.28
V of anatase (100)–H2O, and 0.62 V of anatase (101)–H2O),25 the larger potential drop
can explain the phenomenon that KOH solute contributes substantially
to a chemical bias in experiments (Figure 3).

3.3.3 Calculation
of the Depletion Layer Width
With the potential drop in the
Helmholtz layer, the depletion layer
width, dSC, is calculated as follows 7  where εKOH and εr are the relative dielectric constants of the KOH solution
and anatase TiO2 (83.6), respectively, and Vs is the surface potential barrier of anatase TiO2 (0.2 V).43

Because the H2O molecules adsorbed on the TiO2 surface cannot
be easily rotated, εH2O was set as 5 in
ref (25). Further considering
the addition of K+ and OH–, the relative
dielectric constant εKOH was set as 3. Finally, the
surface depletion layer widths of anatase (001), (100), and (101)
surfaces were estimated as 37.48, 173.25, and 64.49 Å, respectively,
and they are of similar magnitude to the experimental results, i.e.,
tens of Å. The surface depletion layer width order of magnitude
is (100) > (101) > (001). By examining the trapping energies
and trapping
sites of simulated photogenerated holes and electrons based on density
functional theory, Ma et al.44 present
that the order of the relative photooxidation and photoreduction activities
of anatase TiO2 is (100) > (101) > (001). Thus, KOH
has
improved the reactivity of all three surfaces without changing their
relative relation. It also reminds us that anatase (100) should be
increased in the KOH solution for improving the efficiency of PEC
water splitting.

4 Conclusions
In this
work, TiO2 nanoring/nanotube arrays and TiO2 nanotube arrays were prepared and the subsequent PEC experiments
were conducted. It is indicated that the KOH electrolyte provides
1 V bias voltage for the chemical reaction as opposed to Na2SO4 and K+ and OH– ions can
stabilize the photoelectrochemical reaction on TiO2 electrodes
at the same time. In addition, more negative flat-band potential,
larger depletion layer width, and larger capacitance indicate a lower
energy barrier for interfacial electron transfer and a greater photocatalytic
activity in KOH. To better understand the effect of KOH on the interface
properties, molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to investigate
the dynamic structures and properties of 1 M KOH solution on anatase
TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces. K+ ions
prefer to adsorb onto the TiO2 surface and bond to O2c. Therefore, the dynamics of the potassium ions are strongly
dominated by the layered structure of water and the oxygen atoms on
TiO2 surfaces. The coordination numbers of K+ on TiO2(001), (100), and (101) surfaces are 0.85, 0.80,
and 0.94, respectively, and the largest value of (101) surface means
more water molecules accessing to its first coordination layer than
(001) and (100) surfaces.

Based on the density of K, O, and
H atoms, the electrostatic characteristics
along the TiO2/KOH interfaces were analyzed. The charge
distribution in the three interface regions quickly decays to the
bulk value beyond 6 Å from the TiO2 surface. The electric
fields of anatase (001), (100), and (101) change from −0.35
to 1 V/Å near the surface, and anatase (001) has the strongest
electric field, followed by (101) and (100). The potential of anatase
(101) quickly converges to 0 V, while that of anatase (001) keeps
decreasing until it reaches 0 V and that of anatase (100) first decreases
and then rebounds to 0 V. The significant differences are attributed
to the specific adsorption of K+ on TiO2 surfaces,
while OH– asymmetrically distribute in bulk controlled
by repulsive force. Corresponding to the Grahame double layer model,
the resulting depletion layer widths of anatase (001), (100), and
(101) surfaces were calculated as 37.48, 173.25, and 64.49 Å,
respectively. It is suggested that anatase (100) has the largest activity
in the KOH solution, followed by (101) and (001).

All of the
above results clearly illustrate the improvement in
our quantitative understanding of the molecular-scale structure of
K+ and electrostatic characteristics at TiO2/KOH interfaces, in combination with the continuum-based Grahame
model of the electric double layer. Considering that the dielectric
properties of TiO2 are affected by surface conditions such
as defects and impurity doping, more amendments are needed in future
research.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
Ti foils (0.25 mm thick,
99.5% purity) were supplied by Alfa-Aesar. Aluminum oxide (Al2O3) was purchased from Gaona Powder Company (Shanghai,
China). Ethanol (C2H6O), acetone (CH3COCH3), ethylene glycol (EG), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), phosphate acid (H3PO4), sodium fluoride
(NaF), potassium hydroxide (KOH), and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4) were purchased from Beijing Chemical Works. All solutions
were prepared without further purification using deionized water.

5.2 Preparation of TiO2 Nanoring/Nanotube
(RT) Arrays and TiO2 Nanotube (NT) Arrays
First,
Ti foils were cut into pieces of 20 mm × 30 mm and then sonicated
sequentially in acetone, ethanol, and high-purity deionized water,
followed by drying in air. RT was prepared by a two-step anodization
method in ethylene glycol solution with NH4F (0.25 wt %)
and water (2 vol %) in a conventional two-electrode configuration
with Ti foil as the anode and Pt mesh (20 mm × 30 mm) as the
cathode. In first-step anodization, the Ti foil was anodized at 60
V for 60 min and then the as-grown nanotube layer was ultrasonically
removed in deionized water. After drying at 50 °C, the pretreated
Ti foil was used as the anode again for second-step anodization with
20 V for 60 min. A vertically aligned NT electrode was prepared by
one-step anodic oxidation in an aqueous solution of 0.5 M H3PO4 and 0.14 M NaF with consecutive ultrasonication (Kunshan
Ultrasonic Instrument Co. Ltd., KQ-100DE). DC voltage of 20 V was
supplied at room temperature for 60 min. After anodization, the two
samples were thoroughly washed with deionized water immediately to
remove the absorbed ions and annealed in air at 450 °C for 4
h at a heating rate of 2 °C/min. Finally, the samples were connected
to copper wires using silver conductive paste and dried overnight.
Both the substrates and the wires were then covered with an insulating
epoxy resin, leaving only the desired surface area exposed.

5.3 Characterizations
The morphologies
of TiO2 arrays were characterized by a field-emission scanning
electron microscope (FESEM; Hitachi, Japan, S4800). The crystal phases
of the samples were determined using an X-ray diffractometer (XRD;
D8 Advance Bruker/AXS) with Co (30 mA) radiation. The optical absorption
spectra were obtained by employing a Fiber Spectral Instrument (AVANTES,
Netherlands) with compressed BaSO4 powder as a reflectance
standard.

5.4 Photoelectrochemical Measurements
The PEC performances were measured in the three-electrode system
with TiO2, a Ag/AgCl electrode, and a Pt mesh as the working,
reference, and counter electrodes, respectively. A single-compartment
quartz cell filled with 1 M KOH or Na2SO4 electrolyte
was used as the reactor. The samples were illuminated by a solar simulator
(91160, Newport) equipped with an AM 1.5 filter, and the intensity
was calibrated to 100 mW/cm2. The photocurrent density–time
(I–t), electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) and Mott–Schottky (MS) data were collected
at an electrochemical workstation (AUTOLAB PGSTAT302N).
