In this paper, the
mechanistic studies on the isomerization of
hydroxyl and silyl derivatives of bicyclic cyclopropanes under the
catalytic action of Zeise’s salt have been reported. The catalytic
activity of both the monomeric and the dimeric forms of Zeise’s
salt has been studied by applying the high-level quantum mechanical
method. Results from this investigation reveal that the reaction goes
favorably under the catalysis of the dimeric form of Zeise’s
salt. The calculated activation barrier for the catalytic process
using Zeise’s dimer reveals that the rearrangement occurs with
an activation barrier of 19–25 kcal mol–1. Depending on the nature of substituents present on the substrate,
formation of various products has been explained. This study also
includes the heteronuclear counter part of Zeise’s dimer where
one of the Pt-metals is replaced by palladium (Pd) and nickel (Ni)
successively. The calculated activation barrier using these heteronuclear
catalysts is found to be close enough to that calculated for the catalytic
pathway using Zeise’s dimer.

Introduction
The reactions of cyclopropane
derivatives under the transition-metal
catalytic conditions have got considerable attention in various fields
of chemistry.1 In many organic reactions,
the cyclopropane ring system behaves like an unsaturated olefin moiety
because of the similarities in their electronic structures.2 As a result, the tendency of the cyclopropane
system to form coordinate bonds with other transition-metal ions resembles
with the property of the unsaturated compounds that acts as the π-ligand
in many complex molecules for organic synthesis.3,4

The literature survey reveals that the cyclopropane derivative
when coordinated to a platinum atom, invariably undergoes an oxidative
insertion reaction to produce a platinacyclobutane derivative.5

Under several circumstances, the
formation of this four-membered
ring was detected by spectroscopic measurement, yet the instability
of the ring is quite evident by its reactivity with other groups or
reagents present within the substrate or environment that leads to
a variety of rearranged products. In the past few decades, several
instances were noticed where the substrates are found to be mostly
bicyclic in nature.6 In particular, if
the substrate contains an oxy substituent, the ring opening and rearrangement
reactions are quite facile.7 Thus, reports
from Jennings et al. reveal the effective utilization of Zeise’s
salt for the ring opening reactions in conversion of several hydroxy-
and alkoxy-substituted cyclopropane derivatives to methyl ketones8 (Scheme 1a,b). Another report by Sonoda et al. shows an efficient catalytic
isomerization of the cyclopropane derivative to allyl silyl ether
at ambient temperature when the siloxy group is present on the ring
junction9 (Scheme 1c). Madsen et al. extends such ring-opening
reaction in a derivative of the natural product for the synthesis
of 2-C-branched carbohydrates. Such reaction can be performed by using
a variety of O-nucleophiles including alcohols, phenols, and water.10

Scheme 1 Rearrangement Reactions of Bicyclic Derivatives
of Cyclopropane under
the Catalysis of Zeise’s Salt
While proposing the mechanism of these reactions, all
authors assumed
the involvement of a mononuclear Pt-complex for catalyzing the reaction
(Scheme 2). At the
very first step of the mechanisms, the Pt-metal gets inserted into
the cyclopropane moiety by oxidative addition reaction to generate
a four-membered platinacyclobutane ring as an intermediate.

Scheme 2 Reported
Mechanism of the Conversion of the Bicyclic Substrate to
the Monocyclic One under Metal Complex-Catalyzed Condition
Depending on the nature of
various substituents present on the
ring junction, the generated platinacyclobutane intermediate rearranges
to different products. In particular, the presence of the hydroxy
group at the bridge head of the bicyclic skeleton promotes the formation
of keto compounds by cleavage of the Pt–C bond. During such
process, the mandatory transfer of the proton from the hydroxy group
at the ring junction to cyclopropane carbon was further confirmed
by the deuterium labeling experiment and other NMR spectroscopy. When
the silyl group is present at the ring junction of the substrate,
an exocyclic double bond is formed in the product; such formation
could be explained by a [1,2]-hydrogen shift between two adjacent
carbon atoms present on the ring. All mechanisms proposed here utilize
a single Pt-metal ion for the catalytic process; however, the experimental
method reveals clearly the utilization of dimeric Zeise’s salt
to carry out the reaction. Our previous density functional theory
(DFT) study revealed that the involvement of Zeise’s dimer
with the substrate provides a more favorable pathway than that observed
using a single platinum atom for the rearrangement of oxaspirohexane
to 3-methylenetetrahydrofuran.11 Here,
depending on the nature of various substituents in the bicyclic skeleton,
we report our investigation on the mechanism of the reactions by using
the monomeric and dimeric form of the metal catalyst and show the
importance of the dimeric form (Zeise’s salt) in reducing the
activation barrier.

Results and Discussion
To perform
our mechanistic study, we have selected the bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane
derivatives with hydroxy or siloxy substituents at the ring junction
(1 and 2 in Scheme 3) that were previously reported in the experiment. The overview of
the studied pathways is shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Overview of Plausible Mechanisms Involving
the Monomeric and Dimeric
Forms of the Pt-Catalyst Condition
Though a single Pt atom is shown as a catalyzing element,
we have
studied the effect of both the monomeric and dimeric form of Zeise’s
salt involved in catalyzing the reaction to compare the effectiveness
of the catalytic activity of monometallic and dimetallic complexes.
However, representing the single and double activation process, we
have used the letter “M” and “D” attached
to the name of the pathways or stationary points; for example, the
single activation process of pathway-1 is represented as pathway-1M,
whereas the corresponding double activation process is designated
as pathway-1D.

The hydroxyl derivative of the bicyclic compound
(R=H in Scheme 3) furnishes 2-methylcyclopentanone
(designated as pathway-1), whereas the silyl derivative of the same
bicyclic structure results 2-methylene-1-siloxycyclopentane as the
final product (designated as pathway-2). The first step involves the
coordination of the substrate (1 or 2) to the metal center of the
catalyst to form the intermediate complex MI1/DI1. This step is followed by the oxidative addition of a Pt-metal ion
into the cyclopropane moiety to generate four-membered platinacyclobutane
intermediate MI2/DI2. Opening of the platinacyclobutane
ring takes place through the cleavage of the Pt–C bond to produce
intermediate MI3/DI3 (R=SiH3) or MI4/DI4 (R =H). For the hydroxyl
derivative, protodeplatination takes place in intermediate MI4 or DI4 by transferring a proton from the hydroxyl
group to generate methylcyclopentanone as the final product (pathway-1).
However, the silyl derivative MI3 or DI3 promotes
a 1,2-hydride shift which ultimately undergoes a deplatination process
to form the cyclopentane derivative with an exocyclic double bond
(pathway-2).

As the starting reactant may exist in several conformational
isomers,
we have selected the most favorable one by constructing it from cyclopentane
geometry. While constructing the bicyclic structure, we have chosen
the envelope geometry of the cyclopentane ring and utilized its two
adjacent eclipsed carbons to insert the cyclopropane ring for generating
the bicyclic structure (Scheme 4).

Scheme 4 Construction of an Endo and Exo Bicyclic Structure
from Envelope
Conformation of the Cyclopentane Ring
Out of the two possible orientations of the cyclopropane
structure
relative to the cyclopentane ring system (exo and endo in Scheme 4), the exo orientation
is found to be more stable than the endo isomer by 3.8 kcal mol–1. With this exo isomer, the initial complex is generated
by forming a Pt–O coordinate bond between monomeric or dimeric
Zeise’s salt and the oxygen atom of the substrate molecule.
Our investigations on the energy and topology of molecular orbitals
of the substrates have given us a clue about the number and orientation
of metal centers that can be employed to bind with the geometry of
the substrates (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structure and the outermost molecular orbitals of the bicyclic
compounds.

The outermost two filled molecular
orbitals [highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO) and HOMO – 1] have almost the same energies
and are suitable for making the coordinate bond with a metal center.
The next molecular orbital (HOMO – 2) is situated well below
of these two orbitals and may be assumed to be inert for making a
coordinate bond with a metal center. Scrutiny of the topology of the
outermost two molecular orbitals (Figure 1) clearly reveals that the lobes of the wave
functions are largely associated with the edges of the cyclopropane
moiety and with the substituent oxygen atom as well. We surmised that
the electrons associated to these molecular orbitals and suitable
to coordinate with maximum two metal atoms are present at the vicinity
of the substrate.

Study on the Mechanism of Rearrangement of
1-Hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane
The potential energy surface
indicating the transition states and
intermediates involved in all the proposed mechanisms of pathway-1M
and pathway-1D (Scheme 3) are shown in Figure 2. Pathway-1Ma (red color) is an alternative pathway diverged
from pathway-1M (brown color) that shows a variation of mechanism
for the transformation of the bicyclic derivative 1-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane
to 2-methylcyclopentanone under the catalytic action of the monomeric
form of Pt-salt. Similarly, pathway-1Da (magenta color)
is another alternative pathway diverged from pathway-1D (blue color)
that progress under the catalysis of the dimeric form of Zeise’s
salt.

stationary points of pathway-1M (brown color), pathway-1Ma (red color), pathway-1D (blue color), and pathway-1Da (magenta color) under the catalytic condition of the monomeric and
dimeric form of Pt-salt. Energy values that not enclosed in brackets
are calculated using M06-2X functional. Values indicated in the round
bracket are calculated using M06 functional.

Catalysis by Activation of the Substrate with One Metal Atom
The pathway-1M and pathway-1Ma (Figure 2) in which single Pt-metal is used as a catalyst
follow three major steps: the first step is the formation of the four-membered
platinacyclobutane intermediate, the second step is the opening of
the four-membered platinacyclobutane intermediate, and the third step
that is the final step involves with the protodeplatination process.
The initial complex (1MI1), in which the Pt-metal is coordinated
to the hydroxyl oxygen of the substrate, undergoes an oxidative insertion
reaction by crossing an activation barrier of 18.99 kcal mol–1 through the transition-state 1MTS1, and the four-membered
platinacyclobutane intermediate (1MI2) is formed as a product.
The ball and stick models (Figure 3) of the initial complex 1MI1 reveals that
the distance between the hydroxyl oxygen of the substrate and the
coordinated Pt-metal is 2.17 c.

Figure 3 Ball and stick models of the stationary
points during the formation
of the platinacyclobutane intermediate under the catalytic condition
of the monomeric form of Pt-salt.

While forming the transition structure (1MTS1)
in the
oxidative insertion process, the shorter bond length between C3 and
Pt (2.22 Å) in comparison to that of C1–Pt (2.95 Å)
clearly indicates that the bond formation between C3 and the Pt-metal
atom takes place at the early stage of the reaction. While forming
the intermediate from the transition-state 1MTS1, the C1
atom gets the bonding electron mostly from the Pt atom and reduces
its positive charge to some extent (+0.526 to +0.423). It has also
been observed that C1–C3 distance of the cyclopropane moiety
in the initial substrate 1MI1 (1.48 Å) increases to
generate the four-membered platinacyclobutane intermediate 1MI2 (2.34 Å) through the distance 1.88 Å in 1MTS1. Intermediate 1MI2 then undergoes a conformational
change for the formation of the H bond and intermediate 1MI3 is formed through transition-state 1MTS2 with an activation
barrier of 5.30 kcal mol–1.

Opening of the
platinacyclobutane ring then takes place by the
cleavage of one Pt–C1 bond of intermediate 1MI3 to
form intermediate 1MI4 by increasing the C1–Pt distance
from 2.19 Å (in 1MI3, Figure 4) to 3.52–352 Å (in 1MI4, Figure 5). This
cleavage occurs by crossing a very low activation barrier of 3.10
kcal mol–1 through the transition-state 1MTS3. NBO analysis shows that during this cleavage, the C1 atom
acquires more positive charge (+0.459 in 1MI3 to +0.729
in 1MI4 through +0.665 in transition-state 1MTS3), whereas Pt and C3 atoms progressively get negative charge (−0.535
to −0.687 on C3 and +0.365 to +0.270 on Pt). This indicates
that the opening of the platinacyclobutane ring by the cleavage of
the C1–Pt bond is mostly heterolytic in nature. After the opening
of the platinacyclobutane ring, the intermediate 1MI4 undergoes
the protodeplatination process. A direct proton transfer from hydroxyl
oxygen to C3 carbon atom (through 1MTS5) of pathway-1M
results in the detachment of the metal atom to generate the product
(1MI6). This step requires 13.62 kcal mol–1 energy to overcome the activation barrier and the relative energy
of this transition state is 23.16 kcal mol–1 for
the formation of the end product 1MI6 (C2–C1 = 1.51
Å, Figure 5).
However, intermediate 1MI5, from which the proton transferring
reaction starts, differs from intermediate 1MI4 by a small
conformational orientation of the metal atom with respect to the rest
of the structure. Several trials to find out the transition structure
between these two conformers failed, indicating a very low energy
barrier between them. Replacement of the Pt-metal by the migration
of protons results in the reduction of electron density on the Pt-metal
as apparent from the change of NBO charge (+0.270 to +0.429). It reveals
that the delocalization of the bonding electron between the Pt and
C3 atom to the C3 and H atom takes place during the protodeplatination
process. Global activation barrier of pathway-1M is 26.09 kcal mol–1. In an alternative pathway of protodeplatination
(pathway-1Ma), the metal atom is replaced by the proton
from the reactant 1MI7a through the SN2 type
process (with an activation barrier of 26.41 kcal mol–1 through transition-state 1MTS7a) to form intermediate
1MI8a. To continue such pathway, a conformational change
of the intermediate (1MI4) is required through some steps,
out of which one has been detected through transition-state 1MTS5a (activation barrier 8.05 kcal mol–1),
resulting in intermediate 1MI6a. Global activation barrier
of pathway-1Ma is 35.95 kcal mol–1. However,
this pathway requires more activation energy with respect to the previous
pathway-1M and thus is not favorable. The proton transfer, as shown
here, in an intramolecular fashion was already confirmed by the labeling
experiment in the previous report.

points during the conformational
change and cleavage of the platinacyclobutane intermediate under the

Catalysis by Activation of the Substrate with Two Metal Centers
Rearrangement of 1-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane has also been studied
under the catalytic activity of Zeise’s dimer and is shown
in Figure 2 (blue and
magenta in color). The blue-colored pathway, pathway-1D, has been
diverged to pathway-1Da, whereas deplatination reaction
takes place by the migration of a proton. In most of the steps, the
rearrangement follows a similar sequence as that of pathway-1M or
pathway-1Ma. As evident of the Figure 2, the initial oxidative addition of the Pt
metal of the cyclopropane ring to generate platinacyclobutane intermediate
1DI2 (C1–C3 = 2.33 Å
in Figure 6) occurs
by crossing a very low activation barrier (1.69 kcal mol–1) through transition structure 1DTS1 (C1–C3 = 1.82 Å in Figure 6).

Figure 6 Ball and stick models of the stationary points associated
to the
pathway of formation of the platinacyclobutane intermediate under
the catalysis of the dimeric form of Pt-salt.

Comparison of the geometries of the transition states of
oxidative
addition under both monomeric and dimeric metal catalytic conditions
clearly reveals that the geometry of the monometallic transition state
is considerably distorted.

Normally the plane of the square
planar geometry of the Pt-complex
is nearly perpendicular to the plane of the cyclopropane ring in the
transition structure of the oxidative addition of the metal atom that
generates platinacyclobutane (Figure 7a). However, a distorted geometry is identified in
the transition state of the oxidative addition in the bicyclic derivative
of cyclopropane (Figure 7b). The hydrogen bond between the hydroxyl group and the chlorine
atom makes an acute angle between the two planes that distorts the
geometry from its normal one. However, under dimeric conditions, such
distortion in geometry of the transition structure has not been observed
in 1DTS1 (Figure 7c) as the hydroxyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the chlorine
ligand of the second metal atom leaving the chlorine ligand associated
to the first metal atom engaged in the oxidative addition process.
The conformational change of the hydroxyl group converts 1DI2 to 1DI3 through the transition structure 1DTS2 (activation barrier 5.62 kcal mol–1). Cleavage
of the C1–Pt bond in 1DI3 (C1–Pt = 2.35 Å, Figure 8) occurs through
the transition-state 1DTS3 (C1–Pt = 2.47
Å, Figure 8) to
generate 1DI4 (activation barrier 1.05 kcal mol–1) by increasing the C1–Pt bond distance from 2.35 Å (1DI3) to 2.98 Å (1DI4).

substrate when the hydroxyl group is present at the ring junction
under dimeric catalytic conditions.

for the cleavage of the C1–Pt bond under the catalytic condition

The final step of protodemetallation occurs from the intermediate
1DI4 through the transition structure 1DTS4 (activation
barrier 11.12 kcal mol–1) resulting in the final
product 1DI5 (methyl-cyclopentane and Zeise’s dimer).
Both the attachment of proton and the detachment of the metal center
in 1DTS4 (O–H = 1.36 Å, H–C3 = 1.48
Å, Figure 9) occur
from the same face of the C3 atom (Figure 9). We have envisioned another possible way
of protodeplatination such that the incoming proton and the eliminating
Pt-metal should orient in the opposite face of the C3 atom. Such study
results the divergent pathway-1Da that starts by a conformational
reorganization of the cyclopentane ring through the transition structure
1DTS4a (activation barrier 1.43 kcal mol–1), resulting in the intermediate 1DI5a. Another conformation
change of 1DI5a results in 1DI6a, which is necessary
for the final SN2 type mechanism for protodeplatination.
Final protodeplatination occurs through transition-state 1DTS6a (O–H = 1.34 Å, H–C3 = 1.36 Å, Figure 9) with an activation
barrier of 16.08 kcal mol–1. However, this SN2 type protodemetallation makes the global activation barrier
of pathway-1Da, 22.61 kcal mol–1, which
is larger than the global activation barrier of pathway-1D (19.58
kcal mol–1). This double activation process of pathway-1D
is also more favorable than the previously discussed pathway-1M as
revealed from Table 1, thus suggesting the involvement of two Pt metals in catalyzing
the reaction.

Study on the Mechanism of Rearrangement of 1-Siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane
The mechanism of the rearrangement of the silyl derivative of the
bicyclic compound may also be considered as the composite of three
separate steps. The first two steps, that is the oxidative addition
of the metal atom and the cleavage of the platinacyclobutane ring
are similar to that of the rearrangement of 1-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane.
However, the last step, that is the concerted 1,2-shift of hydrogen
and the demetallation of this rearrangement differs from the step
of protodemetallation of the previous path (Scheme 3). The catalysis under the monometallic and
dimetallic condition of this reaction was studied, and photoelectron
spectroscopy (PES) of both of them is presented in Figure 10. The mechanistic pathway
under the single activation of the Pt-metal is designated here as
pathway-2M (violet color in Figure 10), whereas the catalysis under double activation is
designated as pathway-2D (orange color in Figure 10).

stationary points of pathway-2M (violet color) and pathway-2D (orange

form of Pt-salt. Energy values not enclosed in brackets are calculated
using M06-2X functional. Values indicated in the round bracket are
calculated using M06 functional.

Catalytic Activity of Monometallic Complex
The initial
oxidative addition of pathway-2M occurs through the transition-state
2MTS1 (activation barrier 18.85 kcal mol–1) from the intermediate 2MI1, resulting in platinacyclobutane
intermediate 2MI2. It has been revealed from the mechanistic
pathway that this step is endergonic in nature. The distance between
the oxygen atom of the siloxy group (−OSiH3) and
coordinated Pt-metal is 2.19 Å in 2MI1 (Figure 11), and the C1–C3
bond of the cyclopropane moiety increases from 1.48 Å in 2MI1 to 2.32 Å in 2MI2 (through C1–C3 bond
distance 1.96 Å in 2MTS1) during the insertion of
the Pt-metal in the cyclopropane moiety.

of the stationary points during the formation
of the platinacyclobutane intermediate (of the substrate 1-siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane)
under the catalytic condition of the monomeric form of Pt-salt.

In the following step of C1–Pt
bond cleavage, the carbon
atom attached to the siloxy group (−OSiH3) decreases
the electron density around the oxygen atom and facilitates the breaking
of the C1–Pt bond of the four-membered platinacyclobutane intermediate
(2MI2) to generate η1-complex 2MI3 (through transition-state 2MTS2 with an activation
barrier of 3.81 kcal mol–1). This heterolytic cleavage
of the C1–Pt bond gives the zwitter ionic intermediate, 2MI3, the formation of which is followed by a conformational rearrangement
of the siloxy group for the formation of intermediate 2MI4 (transition structure, 2MTS3 with an activation barrier
of 5.68 kcal mol–1). There is another conformational
change of the cyclopentane ring of intermediates 2MI4 through
transition structure 2MTS4 (activation barrier 4.43 kcal
mol–1) to generate intermediate 2MI5.
1,2-hydrogen shift from C2 to C1(Figure 12) of intermediate 2MI5 followed
by a reductive elimination generates the final product 2MI6 (transition structure 2MTS5 with an activation barrier
of 11.83 kcal mol–1). The global activation barrier
of pathway-2M under the catalytic condition of the monomeric form
of Pt-metal is 28.71 kcal mol–1.

step (of the substrate 1-siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) under the catalytic
condition of the monomeric form of Pt-salt.

Catalytic Activity of Dimetallic Complex
Pathway-2D
(Figure 10), which
consists of three major steps, also follows the mechanism similar
to that of pathway-2M under the catalysis of Zeise’s salt.
In the first step of the mechanism, oxidative addition reaction takes
place to form the platinacyclobutane intermediate (2DI2) from the initial substrate complex, 2DI1, by crossing
an activation barrier of 18.61 kcal mol–1(transition
structure 2DTS1 in which C1–Pt = 2.95 Å, C3–Pt
= 2.18 Å, and C1–C3 = 1.89 Å, Figure 13). The next step is the heterolytic cleavage
of the C1–Pt bond of the intermediate 2DI2 to generate
the intermediate 2DI3 through transition structure 2DTS2 (C1–Pt distance 2.55 Å, Figure 13) with an activation barrier of 3.09 kcal
mol–1. For initiating the proton shift and demetallation
process, two necessary successive conformational changes have been
occurred through the transition structures 2DTS3 and 2DTS4 and the associated intermediate 2DI4 in between
them. The first conformational change is responsible for altering
the orientation of the −OSiH3 group from the syn-
to antiposition (transition structure 2DTS3 with an activation
barrier of 5.08 kcal mol–1) for the formation of
intermediate 2DI4. The next one flips the envelope structure
of the cyclopentane ring from one conformation to other generating
the intermediate 2DI5 (through transition-state 2DTS4, with an activation barrier of 1.44 kcal mol–1). The last mandatory step consists of two nuclear movements in which
the 1,2-hydrogen shift occurs from C2 to C1 and the detachment of
the catalytic metal center from C3 to generate intermediate 2DI6. The activation barrier associated to the last step is 12.05
kcal mol–1 through the transition structure 2DTS5. The global activation barrier of pathway-2D is 25.71 kcal
mol–1. However, the overall comparison between pathway-2M
and pathway-2D shows that the global activation barrier of the latter
pathway (25.71 kcal mol–1) is more favorable than
the former one (28.71 kcal mol–1, Table 1).

of the stationary points of the substrate
(1-siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane) under the catalytic condition of the
dimeric form of Pt-salt.

From the previous discussion, it is clear that one of the
two Pt
atoms of Zeise’s dimer is actively involved in the catalytic
process. It participates in oxidative addition with the cyclopropane
ring, consequently involved in the bond-making and bond-breaking process
throughout the course of the rearrangement reaction. The second Pt
provides some secondary support by coordination with various substituents
having the donor atom present in the substrate. To study the role
of other transition metals of the same group, we replaced second Pt
by Pd and Ni in Zeise’s dimer and recalculated the global activation
barrier of the most favorable pathway. The calculated global activation
barrier suggests that heteronuclear Zeise’s dimer bearing one
Pt-atom replaced by Pd or Ni may generate processes which have a comparable
catalytic activity such as homonuclear Zeise’s dimer.

Conclusions
In summary, our DFT study reveals that the formation
of monocyclic
derivatives from the substrate 1-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and
1-siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane takes place in three major steps under
catalytic conditions of monomeric and dimeric forms of Pt-salt. The
first step undergoes the oxidative addition process for the formation
of the platinacyclobutane intermediate which is followed by the cleavage
of the Pt–C bond to open up platinacyclobutane as a second
step. The final step is protodeplatination to generate the end products.
Comparison of the energy barriers associated to different pathways
reveals that double activation by the two Pt metal atoms leads to
the energetically more favorable mechanism to form the products. The
energy barriers associated to the pathway-1D and 2D (19.58 and 25.71
kcal mol–1) are quite reasonable to explain the
room temperature conditions required for the rearrangement. Outcome
of our study on the catalytic activity of heteronuclear Zeise’s
dimer where one of the Pt atoms is replaced by Pd or Ni may provide
importantly to the synthetic chemist to develop a new catalytic system
with multimetallic complexes.

Computational Methods
All calculations
were carried out with the Gaussian 09 computational
program package.12 Geometry optimization
of all species13 was performed using M06-2X
functional14 in the DFT method. The 6-31G(d,p)
basis set15 was employed for all nonmetal
atoms and the LANL2DZ basis set16 was employed
for the Pt atom. The computational method has been found reliable
to study this ring-opening reaction and rearrangement reactions.17 Frequency calculations at the same level of
theory were performed to obtain the gas phase free energies and to
confirm each stationary point to be either a minimum (no imaginary
frequency) or a transition structure (only one imaginary frequency).
Intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were carried out to confirm
the connection of each transition state to its corresponding reactants
and products.18 Single-point self-consistent
reaction field calculations based on the polarizable continuum model
were used for examining the solvation effect in gas-phase optimized
structures.19 To obtain more accurate energies
of the stationary points, single-point calculations were performed
using the LANL2TZ basis set and effective core potential (ECP) with
f polarization function for the metal center.20 Diethylether for 1-hydroxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane and dichloromethane
for 1-siloxy-bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane were used as the solvent. The natural
bond order (NBO) analysis was carried out using the NBO program, where
the basis set is 6-31G(d,p) for nonmetal atoms and LANL2DZ (ECP) for
metals are employed.21 All energies, reported
in the Results and Discussion section, are
relative free energies (ΔG#) at
298.15 K. The global activation barrier was recalculated by optimizing
the relevant stationary points using M06 functional.22
