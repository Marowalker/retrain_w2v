Catalytic cross-coupling of ketones
and secondary alcohols with
primary alcohols is reported. An abundant manganese-based pincer catalyst
catalyzes the reactions. Low loading of catalyst (2 mol %) and catalytic
use of a mild base (5–10 mol %) are sufficient for efficient
cross-coupling. Various aryl and heteroaryl ketones are catalytically
cross-coupled with primary alcohols to provide the selective α-alkylated
products. Challenging α-ethylation of ketones is also attained
using ethanol as an alkylating reagent. Further, direct use of secondary
alcohols in the reaction results in in situ oxidation to provide the
ketone intermediates, which undergo selective α-alkylation.
The reaction proceeds via the borrowing hydrogen pathway. The catalyst
oxidizes the primary alcohols to aldehydes, which undergo subsequent
aldol condensation with ketones, promoted by catalytic amount of Cs2CO3, to provide the α,β-unsaturated
ketone intermediates. The hydrogen liberated from oxidation of alcohols
is used for hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated ketone intermediates.
Notably either water or water and dihydrogen are the only byproducts
in these environmentally benign catalytic processes. Mechanistic studies
allowed inferring all of the intermediates involved. Dearomatization–aromatization
metal–ligand cooperation in the catalyst facilitates the facile
O–H bond activation of both primary and secondary alcohols,
and the resultant manganese alkoxide complexes produce corresponding
carbonyl compounds, perhaps via β-hydride elimination. The manganese(I)
hydride intermediate plays dual role as it hydrogenates α,β-unsaturated
ketones and liberates molecular hydrogen to regenerate the catalytically
active dearomatized intermediate. Metal–ligand cooperation
allows all of the manganese intermediates to exist in same oxidation
state (+1) and plays an important role in these catalytic cross-coupling
reactions.

1 Introduction
Efficient
and catalytic construction of C–C bond is an important
transformation in organic synthesis. Among C–C bond formation
methods, α-alkylation of ketones is one of the pivotal routes
for the synthesis of several biologically active, heterocyclic compounds
and natural product building blocks.1 Conventional
methods involved use of reactive alkyl halides as alkylating reagents
in the presence of stoichiometric amount of base that resulted in
generation of toxic waste, which limited their sustainable applications.2 Advancement in catalysis, in particular introduction
of “borrowing hydrogen” or “hydrogen autotransfer”
methods, allowed to overcome these drawbacks. In recent years, borrowing
hydrogen strategy for C–C bond formation has received significant
attention for the construction of functionalized organic molecules.3 Typical borrowing hydrogen method involves catalytic
dehydrogenation of alcohol to aldehyde and ketones, followed by base-mediated
aldol reaction, which generates the corresponding α,β-unsaturated
ketone intermediate with elimination of water. Further, catalytic
and selective transfer hydrogenation of the enone intermediates using
the hydrogen obtained from the oxidation of alcohols affords α-alkylated
ketones with high atom efficiency. Liberated molecular hydrogen and
water are the only byproducts from this transformation (Scheme 1).4

Scheme 1 Selective Catalytic Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling of Ketones and
Secondary Alcohols with Primary Alcohols Enabled by Borrowing Hydrogen
Concept
In general, this catalytic
alkylation of ketones using alcohols
is implemented using noble metals such as ruthenium,5 palladium,6 osmium,7 iridium,8 etc. Accordingly
nonprecious first-row transition metals9 have drawn much attention. Recently, Beller and co-workers have
reported an aliphatic electron-rich PNP tridentate manganese(I) catalyst
for alkylation of ketones.10 More recently,
α-alkylated ketones have been synthesized by direct dehydrogenative
coupling of readily available and cheap secondary alcohols with primary
alcohols.10b,10c Dehydrogenative cross-coupling
of secondary alcohols and primary alcohols using Rh, Ru, and Ir catalysts
has been reported.5,8b,11 Thus, earth-abundant, inexpensive, more eco-friendly base metals
like Mn-, Fe-, and Co-catalyzed cross-coupling of primary and secondary
alcohols to α-alkylated ketones is desirable. In this direction,
recently, Lang and co-workers have reported ligand-controlled copper(I)-catalyzed
cross-coupling of secondary and primary alcohols.11b

Eminent research groups have designed and developed
various manganese
pincer catalysts, which catalyzed an assortment of organic transformations.12−19 Manganese pincer-based catalysis has become more attractive because
of new selectivity patterns in known reactions; different products
are obtained just by altering the base.20 Recently, Yu and co-workers21 have reported
manganese-catalyzed cross-coupling of secondary alcohols with primary
alcohols, which provided the Guerbet β-alkylated secondary alcohol
products in good yields. Kempe and co-workers14c reported the multicomponent synthesis of pyrimidines from
alcohols and amidines that proceeded via β-alkylation of alcohols.
Using ruthenium pincer catalyst, we have reported the cross-coupling
of secondary alcohols.22a Selective α-alkylation
and α-olefination of nitrile compounds with primary alcohols
and secondary alcohols, respectively, were also reported using ruthenium
catalyst.22b,22c Very recently, we have also
reported manganese-catalyzed selective α-alkenylation of ketones
using primary alcohols.22d In continuation
of our quest to devise and develop atom-economical and sustainable
catalytic transformations, herein, we report the selective cross-coupling
of ketones and secondary alcohols with primary alcohols, which provided
the α-alkylated ketone products in good to excellent yields.
These dehydrogenative and dehydrative cross-coupling reactions are
catalyzed by the manganese(I) pincer-based Kempe catalyst [(PN5P)Mn(CO)2Br] (1) together with catalytic
amount of a mild base.

2 Results and Discussion
During the development of selective α-alkenylation of ketones
using primary alcohols, we have found that catalyst 1 with phenyl substituent in the catalyst backbone favorably produced
the α-alkylated ketone products, while similar catalyst with
4-methyl substitution promoted the selective α-olefination reaction.22d Thus, catalytic α-alkylation of ketones
by primary alcohols using manganese pincer catalyst 1 was investigated. At the outset of our studies, acetophenone and
benzyl alcohol were chosen as benchmark substrates to find the optimal
reaction conditions for the PN5P triazine-based manganese
catalyst 1, and the results are presented in Table 1. Reaction of acetophenone
and benzyl alcohol (each 0.5 mmol) was performed in the presence of
2 mol % catalyst 1 and 5 mol % Cs2CO3 as base in tert-amyl alcohol solvent, which delivered
the desired alkylated product in 63% yield (entry 1, Table 1). Upon increase of base load
to 10 mol %, alkylated product 2a was isolated in 75%
yield (entry 2, Table 1). When the amount of alcohol was increased from 1 to 1.2 equiv,
the outcome was optimal, where the desired 2a was isolated
in 86% yield with more than 99% conversion of acetophenone (entry
3, Table 1). Further,
lowering the catalyst load to 1 mol % resulted in diminished yield
of the product (entry 4, Table 1). Use of different solvents like 1,4-dioxane and toluene
provided the alkylated product 2a in 84 and 51% yield,
respectively (entries 5 and 6, Table 1). Reactions were tested with different bases. Upon
use of sodium carbonate, product 2a was isolated in 11%
yield (entry 7, Table 1). Although use of potassium carbonate as a base provided 97% conversion
of acetophenone, the desired product 2a was isolated
in 47% yield (entry 8, Table 1). Further, use of strong base sodium tert-butoxide provided the moderate conversion (80%) and yield (71%,
entry 9, Table 1).
When the reaction was carried out in the absence of catalyst 1 and in the presence of base alone, the product was obtained
in 20% yield along with other undesired side products (entry 10, Table 1). When alkylation
reactions were carried out with catalyst 1 in the absence
of base and in the absence of both catalyst and base (entries 11 and
12, Table 1), no product
was observed, implying that catalyst and base are essential for the
alkylation of ketones using alcohols.

a Reaction
conditions: acetophenone
(0.5 mmol), benzyl alcohol, catalyst 1 (0.015 mmol),
and the base in tert-amyl alcohol were heated at
140 °C for 24 h.

b Dioxane
was used as solvent.

c Toluene
was used as solvent.

Following
the optimized experimental conditions, a wide range of
alcohols was subjected to manganese-catalyzed α-alkylation reaction
of acetophenone, which offered moderate to excellent yields of alkylated
ketones (Table 2).
In general, complete conversion of acetophenone was observed in all
reactions. Upon using 4-methylbenzyl alcohol, the corresponding alkylated
product 2b was isolated in 91% yield. While 4-fluorobenzyl
alcohol provided the corresponding alkylated product 2c in 83% yield, 4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl alcohol gave 2d only in 56% yield. A heteroaryl alcohol, 2-furanylmethanol, provided
84% of the alkylated product 2e. Further, a series of
aliphatic primary alcohols such as 1-butanol, 1-octanol, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanol,
and 2-cyclohexylethanol were investigated as alkylating partners,
and in all of these experiments, excellent yields (91–97%)
were obtained (2f, 2g, 2i, 2j). However, 2-ethyl-butanol provided 75% of the alkylated
product 2h, perhaps due to steric hindrance in proximity
to alcohol functionality.

Table 2 Manganese-Catalyzed
α-Alkylation
of Acetophenone Using Primary Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: ketone (0.5
mmol), alcohol (0.6 mmol), tert-amyl alcohol (2 mL),
catalyst 1 (2 mol %), and Cs2CO3 (10 mol %) were heated at 140 °C under open condition with
an argon flow. Yields were calculated for isolated products after
column chromatography. Conversion of ketones was determined by gas
chromatography (GC) analysis using toluene as an internal standard
and given within parentheses.

Then, we explored the scope of different aryl ketones in the catalytic
α-alkylation reactions using various primary alcohols (Table 3). Initially, different
acetophenone derivatives bearing electron-withdrawing and electron-donating
substituents were subjected to alkylation with benzyl alcohol. 4-Methylacetophenone
provided the desired alkylated product 3a in 94% isolated
yield. In general, aryl ketones having poor electron-aryl motifs provided
the corresponding alkylated products in lower yields (3b–e) than electron-rich aryl ketones. Gratifyingly,
heteroaryl ketone, 2-acetylthiophene, was transformed to the desired
alkylated product. Upon reaction with benzyl alcohol, 65% of the alkylated
product 3e was isolated. Despite 3-(pyridin-2-yl)propan-1-ol
provided good conversion, its catalytic α-alkylation with 4-methylacetophenone
resulted in 45% of 3f. With piperonyl alcohol as alkylating
partner, 4-methoxyacetophenone yielded 62% of the corresponding alkylated
product 3g. 1-Tetralone and 4-methyl-1-tetralone were
converted quantitatively to the α-alkylated products 3h and 3i in 78 and 88% yields, respectively. Remarkably,
this manganese-catalyzed α-alkylation reaction is highly chemoselective.
Even in the presence of amine functionality, alkylation occurred exclusively
on a carbon α to carbonyl group. Upon catalytic α-alkylation
of 2′-aminoacetophenone with 1-hexanol and 1-heptanol, the
corresponding alkylated products were obtained in 53 and 46% yields
(3j and 3k). Notably, the N-alkylated product
was not observed in this condition, which indicates the chemoselective
C-alkylation over N-alkylation.

conditions: same as in
footnote of Table 2.

To further explore the
scope of manganese-catalyzed α-alkylation
of ketones with primary alcohols, alkylation using ethanol is demonstrated
(Table 4). Acetophenone
and ethanol under the optimized catalytic conditions yielded 58% of
the ethylated product 4a. 4′-Methylacetophenone
and 4′-chloroacetophenone provided 65 and 63% yields of the
corresponding ethylated product 4b and 4c. β-Napthyl methyl ketone provided the ethylated product 4d in 66% yield. However, when 3-acetyl quinoline was examined
under standard experimental conditions, only 23% of the ethylated
product 4e was isolated. Similar catalytic results were
obtained by previously reported manganese-, iron-, and cobalt-catalyzed
α-alkylation of ketones using primary alcohols.9,10a

of Ketones Using Ethanola
a Reaction
conditions: ketone (0.5
mmol), ethanol (1 mL), tert-amyl alcohol (1 mL),
catalyst 1 (2 mol %), and Cs2CO3 (10 mol %) were heated at 140 °C in a sealed tube. Yields were
calculated for isolated products after column chromatography. Conversion
of ketones was determined by GC analysis using toluene as an internal
standard and given within parentheses.

Exclusive chemoselectivity of primary alcohols over
secondary alcohols
on alkylation of ketone was investigated. Acetophenone (1 equiv) with
cyclohexanol and 1-hexanol (each 1.2 equiv) was quantitatively converted
to the α-alkylated product in the presence of catalyst 1 (2 mol %) and Cs2CO3 (10 mol %) to
form 1-phenyloctan-1-one (2k, 86% isolated yield, Scheme 2a). A similar experiment
using 3-pentanol also provided almost identical result (2k, 88% isolated yield Scheme 2b). Reaction of diols such as 1,5-hexanediol with acetophenone
in the presence of catalyst 1 provided a mixture of products
(Scheme 2c). Remarkably,
when acetophenone (1 equiv) was reacted with 1-hexanol (1.2 equiv)
and aniline (1 equiv) in the presence of catalyst 1 (2
mol %) and Cs2CO3 (10 mol %), quantitative conversion
of ketone was observed to provide 1-phenyloctan-1-one (2k, 82% isolated yield, Scheme 2d).

of Acetophenone
In situ monitoring
of the reaction progress by GC on the catalytic
α-alkylation reaction of acetophenone using 4-methylbenzyl alcohol
catalyzed by 1 allowed to infer the intermediates involved.
As reaction proceeded, decrease in concentration of acetophenone (black
line) can be corroborated with increasing concentration of product 2b (blue line). Notably, upon oxidation of 4-methylbenzyl
alcohol, the in situ formed intermediate 4-methylbenzyl aldehyde (green
line) was only short-lived as it undergoes rapid condensation with
acetophenone to provide intermediate A (α,β-unsaturated
ketones, red line). Reaction kinetics also indicated that hydrogenation
of α,β-unsaturated ketone intermediate A to
the corresponding alkylated product was rapid at the outset of the
reaction and became slower over time (Figure 1).

In an attempt to further develop these benign catalytic alkylation
reactions, cross-coupling of secondary alcohols with primary alcohols,
which can result in selective β-alkylation of secondary alcohols
leading to the exclusive formation of α-alkylated ketones, was
envisaged. Thus, using catalyst 1, the cross-coupling
reaction between 1-phenyl-1-ethanol and benzyl alcohol was subjected
to optimization studies, and the results are presented in Table 5. Initial experiments
with different loads of catalyst 1 (3–1 mol %)
and base (Cs2CO3, 10 mol %) provided moderate
to complete conversions (entries 1–3, Table 5). Spectral analyses of the isolated product
clearly indicated the formation of α-alkylated ketone product,
1,3-diphenylpropan-1-one (2a). Upon performing the experiment
using 2 mol % catalyst 1 and 5 mol % Cs2CO3, quantitative conversion of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol was observed
and the alkylated product 2a was isolated in 90% yield
(entry 4, Table 5).
Further decrease of the catalyst and base loads turned out to be detrimental
to the progress of the reaction as incomplete conversions were observed
after 20 h (entries 5–6, Table 5). Control experiments using only catalyst 1, base (Cs2CO3) alone, and an experiment without
catalyst and base (entries 7–9, Table 5) proved that this alkylation requires a
catalyst and a base. Further, under similar reaction conditions, the
effect of different bases was also explored. K2CO3 and KOH provided moderate yields of product (83 and 40%, respectively).
However, use of bases such as NaH, NaOH, Na2CO3, and KOtBu resulted in poor conversion
of secondary alcohols. Surprisingly, the in situ generation of ketones
from the oxidation of secondary alcohols provided facile α-alkylation
reactions by primary alcohols. Using only 5 mol % base, the reaction
was completed in 20 h compared to the requirement of higher load of
base, higher temperature, and longer reaction time required for the
direct ketone alkylation by primary alcohols (see Table 1).

As shown in Table 6, a wide range of primary alcohols was subjected
to manganese-catalyzed
β-alkylation of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol, which provided α-alkylated
ketones in moderate to excellent yields. Reaction of different benzyl
alcohols with 2 mol % catalyst 1 and 5 mol % Cs2CO3 resulted in good conversion of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol,
and the β-alkylated products (2a–c and 2l–n) were isolated in 73–90%
yields. Further, a series of primary aliphatic alcohols (nonbenzylic)
such as 4-phenyl-1-butanol, 3-(pyridin-2-yl)propan-1-ol, 1-hexanol,
1-octanol, 3,5,5-trimethylhexanol, and 2-cyclohexylethanol were investigated
as alkylating partners and, in general, excellent conversions as well
as yields were obtained (2o, 2p, 2g, 2i, and 2j; Table 6). Manganese-catalyzed cross-coupling of
1-phenyl-1-ethanol with benzyl alcohols was reported using strong
base KOtBu.10b

Table 6 Manganese-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling

a Reaction conditions: 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
(0.5 mmol), primary alcohol (0.6 mmol), tert-amyl
alcohol (2 mL), catalyst 1 (0.01 mmol), and Cs2CO3 (0.025 mmol) were heated at 135 °C in open condition
under an argon flow. Yield of the products corresponds to isolated
pure compounds after column chromatography. Conversion of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
was determined by GC using toluene as an internal standard and given
within parentheses.

Next,
substrate scope of structurally diverse secondary alcohols
was investigated in the catalytic cross-coupling reactions with various
primary alcohols. Initially, different secondary alcohol derivatives
bearing electron-donating and electron-withdrawing substituents were
subjected to coupling with benzylic and aliphatic alcohol (Table 7). In general, nonactivated
primary aliphatic alcohols provided the corresponding alkylated products 3m–p in higher yields than aryl alcohols.
Notably, electron-withdrawing halogen-containing secondary alcohols
underwent facile β-alkylation reaction and provided the corresponding
alkylated products 3q–s and 3c in 66–95% yields. Remarkably, as observed in ketone
alkylation reactions, the amine functionality is tolerated in the
catalytic alkylation reactions. When (4-bromophenyl)-1-ethanol was
reacted with (4-aminophenyl)methanol, the desired alkylated product 3t was obtained in 61% yield. Notably, the N-alkylated product
was not observed in this condition, which indicates the chemoselective
C-alkylation over N-alkylation. Heteroaryl secondary alcohols were
also successfully alkylated using this manganese catalysis and alkylated
heteroaryl ketones 3u, 3v, and 3e were isolated in moderate to good yields (Table 7). Nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of secondary
alcohols with primary alcohols is reported, which required the use
of higher load of base (KOH, 50 mol %).10c

Cross-Coupling of Secondary Alcohols with Primary Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions:
same as in
footnote of Table 6, except that different secondary alcohols were used.

Further, the substrate scope was
extended to cyclic secondary alcohols
(Table 8). Thus, the
reactions of 1-indanol with 1-hexanol and 1-octanol resulted in the
corresponding alkylated products 5a and 5b in 98 and 97% isolated yields. Gratifyingly, 1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-1-ol
and its derivatives efficiently reacted with 1-hexanol and 4-phenyl-1-butanol
and afforded the alkylated products 5c, 3h, and 3i in 85–95% isolated yields, respectively
(Table 8).

Table 8 Manganese-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling
of Cyclic Secondary Alcohol with Primary Alcoholsa
a Reaction conditions: same as in
footnote of Table 1, except that different secondary alcohols were used.

The reaction progress on β-alkylation
reaction of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
with 3-phenyl-1-propanol catalyzed by 1 was monitored
using GC, which indicated zero-order kinetics for the conversion of
secondary alcohols as well for the formation of β-alkylated
ketone product 2o (Figure 2). Notably, upon oxidation of 3-phenyl-1-propanol,
the in situ formed intermediate hydrocinnamaldehyde was observed in
a trace amount. Further, the rapid condensation of aldehyde with in
situ generated acetophenone from 1-phenyl-1-ethanol provides α,β-unsaturated
ketone intermediate. However, ketone and α,β-unsaturated
ketone intermediates were not observed in the reaction; perhaps they
undergo concomitant condensation and hydrogenation reactions, respectively.

Figure 2 Monitoring the manganese-catalyzed β-alkylation of secondary
alcohols by primary alcohols using GC; concentrations of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
(black line), product 2o (blue line), and hydrocinnamaldehyde
(green line).

In a further attempt
to identify the intermediates involved in
this transformation, the catalytic reaction of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
with benzyl alcohol was intervened and the reaction mixture was subjected
to 1H NMR analysis, which resonated a characteristic singlet
at δ 10.05 ppm and a distinct doublet at δ 7.85 ppm with
a coupling constant J = 16 Hz that corresponds to
aldehyde proton of benzaldehyde and olefin protons of (E)-chalcone, respectively.23

Moreover, a mercury poisoning experiment
was performed to examine
the involvement of any metal nanoparticles formed from complex 1. When the dehydrogenative and dehydrative coupling of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
with benzyl alcohol was carried out in the presence of mercury (2
equiv, relative to substrate), nearly 93% conversion of 1-phenyl-1-ethanol
was observed and the alkylated ketone 2a was obtained
in 87% (see Scheme 3), indicating the involvement of molecular intermediates. Further,
when 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanol independently reacted with catalyst 1 under optimized experimental conditions, exclusive formation
of 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)ethanone was observed in 74% yield, confirming
the catalytic oxidation of secondary alcohols to ketones.

Scheme 3 Mercury
Poisoning Test and Observation of Ketone Intermediate
On the basis of these observations and the experimental
studies
involving catalyst 1 in recent reports,14b,22d the plausible catalytic cycle is proposed in Scheme 4. In the presence of catalytic amount of
base, the dearomatized coordinatively unsaturated intermediate I is generated from catalyst 1 upon amine deprotonation
and debromination from the metal center. O–H activation of
the primary and secondary alcohols by intermediate I via
proton transfer to the dearomatized imine nitrogen results in the
formation of alkoxo intermediate II, which undergoes
β-hydride elimination to release the aldehyde and ketone, and
generates a saturated monohydrido manganese complex III. Notably, Liu24a and Milstein24b have previously isolated similar manganese
alkoxo monohydrido complexes. Deprotonation of the α-acidic
protons of carbonyl compound by base possibly generates the carbon
nucleophile. Nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated methyl or methylene
group of the ketone on the in situ formed aldehyde intermediate leads
to an aldol condensation, resulting in the formation of α,β-unsaturated
ketone intermediate (observed experimentally) and water. Interestingly,
deprotonation of the methyl or methylene groups requires only catalytic
amount of a mild base. The manganese hydride complex III concomitantly hydrogenates α,β-unsaturated ketone intermediates
to afford the redox neutral alkylated product along with the regeneration
of catalytically active intermediate I. The dearomatization–aromatization
metal–ligand cooperation operative in manganese intermediates
maintains the same oxidation state (+1) at all intermediate complexes
and plays an important role in this selective catalytic coupling of
ketones and secondary alcohols with primary alcohols.

Alcohols
3 Conclusions
In summary, manganese pincer 1 catalyzed cross-coupling
of ketones and secondary alcohols with primary alcohols leading to
the selective α-alkylation of ketones. Primary alcohols serve
as alkylating reagents. Remarkably, using a minimal catalyst load
(2 mol %) and base (5–10 mol %), various ketones and secondary
alcohols can be efficiently alkylated with an assortment of linear
primary alcohols in excellent yields. Ethylation of ketones using
ethanol is also demonstrated. Chemoselective α-alkylation of
ketones is observed with primary alcohol in the presence of nonbenzylic
secondary alcohol. Moreover, chemoselective catalytic C-alkylations
of ketone and secondary alcohols over N-alkylation of aryl amine are
achieved. Mechanistic studies confirm the formation of aldehyde, ketone,
and α,β-unsaturated ketone intermediates. Accordingly,
a catalytic cycle incorporating the formation of these intermediates
eventually leading to the α-alkylated ketones is proposed. One
equivalent of hydrogen liberated from oxidation of primary and secondary
alcohols is utilized by the catalyst for the hydrogenation of α,β-unsaturated
ketones to deliver the β-alkylated ketones. Overall, the catalytic
coupling of ketones with alcohol releases 1 equiv of water, while
the cross-coupling of secondary and primary alcohols produces 1 equiv
of water and molecular hydrogen from the reactions as the only byproducts.

4.3 General
Procedure for α-Alkylation of
Acetophenone Using Alcohols
Inside a nitrogen atmosphere
glovebox, a 25 mL Schlenk tube was charged with a stir bar, catalyst 1 (0.01 mmol), base (0.05 mmol), acetophenone (0.5 mmol),
solvent (2 mL), and alcohol (0.6 mmol) in the same order. The reaction
flask was taken out of the glovebox and then refluxed (oil bath temperature,
140 °C) with stirring in an open system under argon flow for
24 h. The reaction mixture was then cooled down to room temperature.
The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and 0.5 mmol internal
standard (toluene) was added into the reaction mixture and then diluted
with 0.8 mL of acetone. An aliquot of the solution was passed through
a small Celite plug and analyzed by GC. The solvent was evaporated
under reduced pressure and the crude reaction mixture was purified
by column chromatography over silica gel (60–120 mesh) using
ethyl acetate/pet ether mixture as an eluent. The conversion of acetophenone
was calculated using GC analysis, and yields of pure products were
determined after column chromatography.

4.4 General
Procedure for Dehydrogenative Cross-Coupling
of Alcohols
Inside a nitrogen atmosphere glovebox, a 25 mL
Schlenk tube was charged with a stir bar, catalyst 1 (0.01
mmol), Cs2CO3 (0.025 mmol), secondary alcohol
(0.5 mmol), tert-amyl alcohol (2 mL), and primary
alcohol (0.6 mmol) in the same order. The reaction flask was taken
out of the glovebox and refluxed (oil bath temperature 135 °C)
with stirring in an open system under argon flow for 24 h. The reaction
mixture was then cooled down to room temperature. The solvent was
evaporated under reduced pressure and 0.5 mmol internal standard (toluene)
was added into the reaction mixture and then diluted with 0.8 mL of
acetone. An aliquot of the solution was passed through a small Celite
plug and analyzed by GC. The solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure, and the crude reaction mixture was purified by column chromatography
over silica gel (60–120 mesh) using ethyl acetate/pet ether
mixture as an eluent. The conversion of secondary alcohol was calculated
using GC analysis, and yields of pure products were determined after
column chromatography.
