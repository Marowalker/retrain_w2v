Monitoring the β-lactam antibiotic level has been
an important
task in food industry and clinical practice. Here, we report the development
of a fluorescent PenP β-lactamase, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q, for efficient β-lactam
antibiotic detection. It was constructed by covalently attaching fluorescein
onto the active-site entrance of a thermostable E166Cf/N170Q mutant
of a Bacillus licheniformis PenP β-lactamase.
It gave a fluorescence turn-on signal toward various β-lactam
antibiotics, where the fluorescence enhancement was attributed to
the acyl–enzyme complex formed between PenP-E166Cf/N170Q and
the β-lactam antibiotic. It demonstrated enhanced signal stability
over its parental PenP-E166Cf because of the suppressed hydrolytic
activity by the N170Q mutation. Compared with our previously constructed
PenPC-E166Cf biosensor, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q was more thermostable and
advanced in detecting β-lactams in terms of response time, signal
stability, and detection limit. Positive fluorescence signals generated
by E166Cf/N170Q in response to the penicillin-containing milk and
mouse serum illustrated the feasibility of the biosensor for antibiotic
detection in real samples. Taken together, our findings suggest the
potential application of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q in biosensing β-lactam
antibiotics.

==== Body
1 Introduction
β-Lactam antibiotics,
including penicillins and cephalosporins,
are nowadays the most consumed antibiotics worldwide and have been
extensively used in human and veterinary medicine.1−3 Surveillance
of their level in food and biological samples has posed significant
implications in food industry and clinical practice. Presence of β-lactam
antibiotic residues in edible products from animal origin (e.g., milk
and poultry meat), which has often been attributed to improper use
and overuse of the antibiotics, can lead to adverse consequences including
difficulties in fermentation in food industry, potential public health
threats of antibiotic allergy in hypersensitive individuals, and emergence
of antibiotic-resistant superbugs.4−8 Thus, it is necessary to stringently monitor the residual level
of β-lactam antibiotics for food safety control. In addition,
quantification of the antibiotic level in clinical samples (e.g.,
human plasma) can help evaluate the pharmacokinetics of the therapeutics,
which is important information for the determination of effective
dosing regimens in the infection treatment.9,10

Presently, numerous methods have been devised for detection of
various types of antibiotics in food and biological samples. In general,
they fall into three major categories: microbial inhibition tests,
rapid tests, and analytical methods. Microbial inhibitory assays rely
on the susceptibility of bacteria to the residual antibiotics in the
samples.11−14 They are simple and cost-effective, but lengthy and lack of selectivity.
Rapid tests (e.g., ELISA and surface plasmon resonance biosensor)
are screening methods based on the recognition between antibiotics
or receptor proteins specific to a particular type of antibiotics.11,15−20 They allow fast and sensitive but usually semi-quantitative determination
for the antibiotic level. Analytical methods, including high-performance
liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (MS), provide a confirmatory
assessment of the antibiotic’s authenticity and a precise qualitative
measurement of the antibiotic level.21−25 However, these methods are usually laborious, requiring
sophisticated equipment and tedious sample preparation steps. All
these three categorical approaches have often been employed for practical
β-lactam antibiotic detection.11,14,17−20 Microbial inhibition tests provide a nondiscriminatory
detection of β-lactam antibiotics, whereas analytical analyses
offer a discriminatory examination of the drug level. In parallel
to these two approaches, rapid tests specific to β-lactam antibiotics,
for example, Charm test and Parallux, are often adopted for fast screening.17,26−28 Furthermore, there has been a growing trend in developing
innovative biosensors for simple, speedy, reliable, and efficient
screening of antibiotic residues in food and clinical specimens.19,29−32

In the face of the growing demands for reliable, sensitive,
and
rapid detection system for β-lactam antibiotics, we previously
developed a fluorescent β-lactamase-based biosensor, PenPC-E166Cf,
as a reagentless platform for screening β-lactam antibiotics.29 β-lactamase is a bacterial enzyme that
can hydrolyze the β-lactam ring of the antibiotics, conferring
bacterial resistance to these drugs.33 Taking
the advantage of the substrate specificity of β-lactamase to
a broad spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics, in our previous study,
a PenPC β-lactamase from Bacillus cereus was engineered into a biosensor by replacing the catalytically important
glutamate residue at position 166 (E166) with a cysteine, followed
by a conjugation of a fluorescein molecule at that site. Although
PenPC-E166Cf demonstrated a dramatically reduced hydrolytic activity
than the wild-type PenPC β-lactamase, its binding ability with
β-lactams was greatly restored.29 For antibiotic detection, the active-site pocket of PenPC-E166Cf
served as the recognition element of the biosensor by allowing specific
binding of the antibiotic substrate to the biosensor. Upon substrate
binding, fluorescein located in close proximity to the active site
flipped out from a buried hydrophobic region to a more solvent-exposed
environment.29 In this way, fluorescein
participated as a signal transducer in which its movement away from
the active-site cavity triggered a fluorescence enhancement of PenPC-E166Cf,
thereby reporting the presence of antibiotics in the tested sample.34 This hypothesis of the biosensing mechanism
of fluorescein-modified β-lactamase was confirmed by crystallographic
analysis using an E166Cf derived from a thermostable PenP β-lactamase
from Bacillus licheniforms.35 PenP β-lactamase shares 52% identity in
the amino acid sequence with the PenPC enzyme.36,37 Both PenP and PenPC enzymes belong to class A β-lactamase,
possessing conserved structural and functional elements essential
for the same mechanistic action for hydrolyzing β-lactam antibiotics
via the transient formation of an acyl–enzyme complex (Scheme 1).38,39 PenP-E166Cf was prepared by the same active-site-selective labeling
approach as PenPC-E166Cf, and it exhibited a similar fluorescence
profile for antibiotic detection as its PenPC counterpart.35 From our previous studies, both PenPC- and PenP-E166Cf
biosensors were shown to enable a reliable and specific fluorescence
detection of the β-lactam antibiotics in human plasma with low
signal interference by the biological fluid.40,41

Scheme 1 Hydrolytic Reaction of β-Lactam Antibiotics by a Class A β-Lactamase
Binding of β-lactamase
(E) with the antibiotic substrate (S) leads to the formation of the
Michaelis complex (ES). ES then undergoes an irreversible step of
acylation to form an acyl–enzyme complex (ES*). Deacylation
of ES* eventually takes place, leading to a release of the hydrolyzed
product (P) from the active site of the enzyme.

With an aim of improving the biosensor performance of E166Cf, in
this study, we have established a new PenP-E166Cf/N170Q system for
β-lactam antibiotic detection. This biosensor is derived from
PenP-E166Cf, in which an N170Q mutation was incorporated into the
protein core to lower its rate of deacylation. We have postulated
that PenP-E166Cf/N170Q would show more advanced biosensor features
compared to PenPC- and PenP-E166Cf biosensors. First, it would exhibit
enhanced protein stability than PenPC-E166Cf because of its thermostable
PenP β-lactamase scaffold. Second, it would give a more stable
fluorescence signal than the E166Cf biosensors because the degradation
rate of the fluorescence signal contributing the acyl–enzyme
complex would be reduced owing to its impaired catalytic activity
by the N170Q mutation. Here, we report the development of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
as an improved version of the E166Cf sensor. Its thermostability and
performance in β-lactam antibiotic detection were assessed and
compared with those of the E166Cf biosensors.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalytic Impairment in E166C and E166C/N170Q
Mutants
E166 is a catalytically important residue playing
an indispensable role in deacylation of the β-lactamase hydrolysis.42 According to the kinetic results (Table 1), mutation of E166 caused a
∼600-fold decrease and a ∼40 000-fold decrease
in the catalytic efficiency of PenP β-lactamase for CENTA and
nitrocefin, respectively. When compared with the wild-type PenP enzyme,
the E166C mutant displayed a ∼200-fold decrease in the kcat value and a 3-fold increase in the Km value for CENTA, whereas it showed a 4 ×
105-fold reduction in kcat with
a ∼10-fold drop in Km for nitrocefin.
These data implied that E166C mutation posed a severe effect on the
hydrolytic rate without significantly affecting the enzyme’s
binding affinity with the substrate. In our study, we introduced an
N170Q mutation onto the E166C mutant to further suppress the catalytic
activity of that mutant. N170, a conserved residue among class A β-lactamases,
is important for deacylation. It has been reported that N170Q mutation
can render the enzyme defective in deacylation by eliminating the
hydrolytic water molecule in the active site.42,43 According to our data, N170Q mutation in the E166C mutant resulted
in a profound reduction in the catalytic efficiency of PenP β-lactamase.
Catalytic efficiencies of E166C/N170Q were ∼1000-fold lower
for CENTA and ∼1.3 × 105-fold lower for nitrocefin
than those of the wild type. Compared with E166C, the E166C/N170Q
mutant exhibited a 1.1-fold decrease in Km and a 1.9-fold decrease in kcat in the
hydrolysis of CENTA, whereas it gave a 1.7-fold lower Km value and a 5-fold lower kcat value in the hydrolysis of nitrocefin. These findings reveal that
N170Q mutation caused a slight increase in substrate-binding affinity
and a further impairment in the catalytic activity of the E166C mutant.

2.2 Active-Site Labeling Approach for the Construction
of PenP Biosensors
In this study, PenP β-lactamase
mutants, which served as the biosensor scaffolds, were produced as
a fusion protein with a maltose binding protein (MBP). To construct
the fluorescent PenP β-lactamase-based biosensors, we adopted
an active-site labeling approach to conjugate a fluorescent probe
to MBP-PenP enzymes. Residue E166 of a wild-type PenP β-lactamase
was first mutated to be a unique cysteine in the active-site pocket,
and then a fluorescein molecule was specifically tethered to that
location covalently via a thiol reaction between fluorescein-5-maleimide
and the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine. Labeled β-lactamase
E166C and E166C/N170Q mutants showed fluorescent bands on the protein
gel under UV illumination (Figure S2).
This indicates the successful labeling of these mutants. As evaluated
by MS, these mutants were site-specifically conjugated with fluorescein
in a 1:1 ratio to give PenP-E166Cf and PenP-E166Cf/N170Q, respectively,
with a more than 90% labeling efficiency (Figure S3). CD analysis revealed that neither mutations nor modification
with fluorescein-5-maleimide imposed a significant distortion on the
overall secondary structure of the PenP enzyme (Figure S4).

2.3 Fluorescence Biosensing Mechanism of PenP
Biosensors
In our previous study, fluorescence signal generation
of PenP-E166Cf was examined by fluorometric studies, mass spectrometric
analysis, and crystallographic study.35 In PenP-E166Cf, fluorescein at position 166 is located at the entrance
of the active-site cavity and situated on a flexible Ω-loop
of PenP β-lactamase. In the apo structure, the rigid planar
core of fluorescein protruded toward the active site, partially occupying
the active-site pocket.35 In the presence
of the β-lactam substrate, the entry of the substrate to the
β-lactamase’s active site induced a change in the local
environment of the fluorescein. Flexibility of the Ω-loop allowed
a displacement of fluorescein from a buried hydrophobic region to
a more solvent-exposed environment so as to provide space for the
accommodation of the substrate in the active-site pocket. This drove
a fluorescence enhancement of PenP-E166Cf, reporting the occupancy
of the active site. With substrate hydrolysis by E166Cf, the release
of the degraded products from the active site allowed the fluorescein
to restore its original orientation, thereby leading to a recovery
of the fluorescence signal to its basal level. In the current study,
PenP-E166Cf/N170Q was shown to employ a similar biosensing mechanism
as PenP-E166Cf. Upon the addition of penicillin G, the fluorescence
intensity of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q was rapidly enhanced and became level-off
in the first 40 s (Figure 1a). This fluorescence turn-on signal was characterized by
a mass spectrometric analysis under the same experimental condition.
From the mass spectra obtained within the initial 30 s of the reaction
between PenP-E166Cf/N170Q and penicillin G, the disappearance of the
enzyme (E) was accompanied by a progressive formation and accumulation
of the acyl–enzyme complex (ES*) (Figure 1b). This indicated that ES* predominantly
contributed to the fluorescence enhancement upon the addition of the
β-lactam antibiotic.

and penicillin G was monitored by (a) stopped-flow fluorescence measurement
and (b) MS. (a) Initial fluorescence change of the PenP-E166Cf/N170Q

PenP-E166Cf/N170Q and penicillin G (ES*).

2.4 PenP-E166Cf/N170Q Displayed an Improved Biosensing
Performance Over the E166Cf Biosensors
To evaluate the performance
of the fluorescent biosensors for β-lactam detection, fluorescence
measurements of PenP-E166Cf and PenP-E166Cf/N170Q were conducted with
the addition of three penicillins (ampicillin, penicillin G, and penicillin
V) (Figure 2) and three
cephalosporins (cefotaxime, cefoxitin, and moxalactam) (Figure 3). In general, the two biosensors
gave an enhanced fluorescence signal in an antibiotic concentration-dependent
manner toward these β-lactam antibiotics. The rising phase of
the fluorescence signal resulted from the binding of the biosensor
with the antibiotic substrate. When the active site of a biosensor
was saturated with the antibiotics, the signal reached its plateau
level. With the substrate hydrolysis by the biosensor, the signal
declined and returned to its basal level. The calibration curve for
the detection of each antibiotic was prepared by plotting the maximum
change of the fluorescence intensity against the concentration of
the antibiotic (Figure S6). Parameters
relating to the biosensor performance of PenP-E166Cf and PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
are compared together with those of the previously reported PenPC-E166Cf
and summarized in Table 2.

b Response time: time taken by the
biosensor to give a signal reaching a stable maximal level after the
addition of a minimal saturating concentration of antibiotics. The

the PenPC biosensor were 1 and 10 μM, respectively.

is determined in the presence of antibiotics at a saturating concentration.

(for PenP biosensors: 1 μM and for PenPC biosensor: 10 μM)
and indicated by the time at which a stable maximal level of the fluorescence
signal starts to decline.

e Limit of detection: the lowest antibiotic
level that can be detected by the biosensor.

f Tm (oC):
temperature at the relative ellipticity at 222 nm of a
protein is dropped to 50% as observed by CD spectroscopy.

g ND: not detectable.

h NM: not measured.

i values obtained by analyzing the
results obtained from Chan et al.29

j NA: not available.

At the saturating concentration of the β-lactam
antibiotics,
the maximum intensity change of PenP-based biosensors and PenPC-E166Cf
was ∼25–36% and ∼24–60%, respectively
(Table 2 and Figure S6). Thus, the amplitude of the signal
given by the two PenP biosensors was similar, but lower than that
generated by PenPC-E166Cf.

For the detection of penicillins,
all the PenP and PenPC biosensors
showed a rapid fluorescence enhancement (Figures 2, S5 and Table 2). Because the initiation
of the fluorescence turn-on upon the addition of the penicillin-type
antibiotic was too fast to be detected, the recorded fluorescence
intensity had already reached the maximal level and differences in
the response time were not detectable among the three biosensors.
In contrast, for the detection of cephalosporins, the two PenP biosensors
displayed a faster response than PenPC-E166Cf (Figures 3, S5 and Table 2).

Signal stability
of the β-lactamase-based biosensors correlated
to the susceptibility of the β-lactam analytes toward the hydrolysis
by the biosensors and the stability of the acyl–enzyme complex.
Therefore, it was envisaged that biosensors with inefficient deacylation
can give rise to a stable fluorescence signal owing to the accumulation
of the acyl–enzyme adduct. Mutation of the catalytic residue
E166 significantly lowered the deacylation rate of the E166Cf biosensors.
From our results, fluorescence signals attributed to PenP-based E166Cf
biosensors were steadier than those from PenPC-E166Cf (Figures 2 and S5). In particular, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q showed a longer duration of signal
than PenP-E166Cf (Table 2). This implied that a further impairment in deacylation of PenP-E166Cf
by the introduction of N170Q mutation improved the stability of the
PenP biosensors.

For the three tested antibiotics, PenP-E166Cf
and PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
offered a lower detection limit than PenPC-E166Cf. From our data,
the lowest detection level for PenP-E166Cf and PenP-E166Cf/N170Q was
0.01 μM, whereas that for PenPC-E166Cf was 0.1 μM (Table 2 and Figure S6).

Overall, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q showed a similar
biosensor performance
as PenP-E166Cf in terms of the response time, maximum fluorescence
change, and limit of detection, but it demonstrated higher signal
stability than PenP-E166Cf. In addition, both PenP biosensors showed
superiority over their PenPC counterpart with respect to the signal
stability, response time, and detection limit.

2.5 PenP Biosensors Were More Thermostable than
PenPC-E166Cf
Thermostability of the PenP and PenPC biosensors
was compared in terms of the secondary structure and catalytic activity
(Table 2). To assess
the structural stability against thermal stress, the thermal denaturation
curve of the proteins was determined by plotting the ellipticity change
of the proteins at 222 nm as a function of temperature using circular
dichroism (Figure 4a). The mid-point of the thermal denaturation curve corresponds to
the temperature at which a protein denatures (melting temperature, Tm). MBP-PenP β-lactamase exhibited a Tm of 64 °C which was consistent with the
reported Tm of PenP (63 °C),45 revealing that the MBP demonstrated no effect
on the thermostability of the enzyme. PenP-E166C and PenP-E166C/N170Q
showed the same Tm of 59 °C. Fluorescein-labeled
mutants, PenP-E166Cf and PenPC-E166Cf/N170Q, displayed a similar value
of Tm, which was lower than those of the
unlabeled mutants, revealing that fluorescein labeling slightly destabilized
the structure of the cysteine mutants. No matter the cysteine mutants
were native or labeled, PenP mutants demonstrated a higher Tm than the PenPC-E166C mutant, illustrating
a higher thermostability of the PenP enzyme than the PenPC β-lactamase.

Figure 4 Thermostability
of the PenP and PenPC biosensors. (a) Thermal denaturation
curves of the biosensors determined by CD. Temperature at which the
relative ellipticity at 222 nm is reduced to 50% is regarded as the
melting temperature (Tm) of the protein.
(b) Residual activities of PenP- and PenPC-based biosensors at 50
°C.

To examine the effect of heat stress on the activity
of the β-lactamase-based
biosensors, a heat inactivation study was performed by determining
the residual activity of β-lactamase for hydrolyzing nitrocefin
after 50 °C incubation at different time intervals (Figure 4b). Upon 1 h incubation
at 50 °C, unlabeled and fluorescein-labeled PenP mutants showed
no reduction in enzyme activity. This observation was in good agreement
that the PenP enzymes had Tm higher than
50 °C, and thus these proteins can preserve their structural
conformation and maintain their proper function in hydrolyzing the
β-lactam substrate at 50 °C. Conversely, activities of
the PenPC counterparts, which possessed a Tm value lower than 50 °C, dropped gradually with time and eventually
ceased in 1 h. Taken together, PenP biosensors were more thermally
stable than PenPC-E166Cf. Moreover, higher tolerance toward thermal
stress probably facilitates the storage and durability during detection
of these fluorescent biosensors.

2.6 Potential Applications of PenP-Based Biosensors
In our previous studies, PenPC-E166Cf and PenP-E166Cf have shown
their applications in monitoring the pharmacokinetics of meropenem
(a β-lactam antibiotic used in the current clinical setting)
in human and animal plasma.40,41 In this study, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
gave fluorescence turn-on signals in the penicillin G containing mouse
serum (Figure 5a).
The change in its fluorescence intensity was in an antibiotic concentration-dependent
fashion. This finding reveals its capability in determining the antibiotic
level of the biological samples in clinical practice.

traces of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q with mouse serum or milk containing various
concentrations of penicillin G: 0 (orange); 0.01 μM (red); 0.1

point of the trace was the average value collected from three independent
measurements. Lower panels: The corresponding calibration curve for
the detection of penicillin G. Each point shows the mean ± S.E.M.

Apart from this, our current study also shows that
PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
allowed antibiotic detection in milk. PenP-E166Cf/N170Q displayed
a fluorescence enhancement with the addition of the penicillin G-containing
milk sample (Figure 5b). Such a fluorescence profile in milk is similar to those observed
in potassium buffer (Figure 2b, right panel) and animal serum (Figure 5a), although there are some variations in
parameters, for example, signal duration, which may be due to the
batch variation of the biosensor and/or effect of the different compositions
of the testing sample medium. Here, it is the first time we demonstrate
the potential application of the β-lactamase-based biosensors
for sensing antibiotics in milk.

Furthermore, PenP biosensors
may become tools for investigating
the structure–function relationship of β-lactamase. Nowadays,
class A β-lactamases are the most prevalent β-lactamases
worldwide,39 and understanding of their
interaction with different substrates provides valuable information
for the development of effective and potent therapeutics for combating
these clinically problematic enzymes. As pointed out by our previous
and current studies, fluorescence enhancement in the antibiotic detection
of the E166C-based biosensors is mainly resulted from the accumulation
of the acyl–enzyme complex (ES*).34,35 The fluorescence traces of these biosensors provide a real-time
monitoring of ES*, thereby reflecting the enzymatic reactions occurred
in the β-lactamases’ active site. Our current study showed
that an incorporation of N170Q mutation onto E166Cf has led to changes
in the fluorescence signal pattern in accordance to the mutational
effects (e.g., an increased signal duration due to a reduction in
the deacylation rate of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q). Therefore, we envision
that via the introduction of various mutations of interest onto E166Cf
and a comparison of the fluorescence signals between E166Cf and these
derivatives, a fast screening of the mutations for their influences
on catalytic function and substrate specificity might be easily achieved.

3 Conclusions
In this present study,
a fluorescent biosensing molecule, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q,
has been prepared by conjugating fluorescein onto the active site’s
entrance of a thermostable and catalytically defective β-lactamase
mutant. In the β-lactam antibiotic detection, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
demonstrated similar biosensing performance as its parental PenP-E166Cf,
but with further impairment in deacylation, it gave a more stable
signal than its E166Cf counterpart. Compared with our previously developed
PenPC-E166Cf, this new biosensor showed higher stability against heat
stress and also better detection performance in terms of response
time, signal stability, and detection limit. In conclusion, PenP-E166Cf/N170Q
illustrates a great potential to be a versatile tool for antibiotic
detection in clinical practice and food industry, and its parental
PenP-E166Cf may find its application as a screening platform for β-lactamase
mutants’ functions.

4 Experimental Procedures
4.1 Chemicals
Ampicillin, cefotaxime,
cefoxitin, CENTA, moxalactam, penicillin G, penicillin V, and kanamycin
were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). Nitrocefin was from
Becton Dickinson Company (Cockeysville, Md). Fluorescein-5-maleimide
was purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR, USA). The chemical
structures of the fluorescein-5-maleimide and antibiotics used in
this study are shown in Figure S1.

4.2 Overexpression and Purification of PenP β-Lactamase
The PenP β-lactamase wild type and mutants were produced
in Escherichia coli with a fusion partner
of an MBP at their N-terminus. Briefly, the PenP β-lactamase
gene (encoding amino acid residue 29–293) from Bacillus licheniformis was subcloned into pMAL-c2X
(New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA, USA). To avoid contamination with
TEM-1 β-lactamase encoded by the ampicillin resistance marker
of pMAL-c2X, the ampicillin resistance gene was replaced with a kanamycin
resistance marker by PCR mutagenesis. The resultant MBP-PenP construct
was then used as a template for the construction of PenP-E166C and
PenP-E166C/N170Q mutants. These mutants were prepared by site-directed
mutagenesis using the QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene,
La Jolla, CA, USA). The mutagenic primers were as follows: for E166C
mutation: forward: 5′–CGA TTC TGC CCA GAG TTA AAT GAA
GTG AAT CCG GGT GAA–3′ and reverse: 5′–TTC
ACC CGG ATT CAC TTC ATT TAA CTC TGG GCA GAA TCG–3′;
and for E166C/N170Q double mutation: forward: 5′–CGA
TTC TGC CCA GAG TTA CAG GAA GTG AAT CCG GGT GAA–3′ and
reverse: 5′–TTC ACC CGG ATT CAC TTC CTG TAA CTC TGG
GCA GAA TCG–3′. The authenticity of the MBP-fusion constructs
was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The MBP-fusion constructs of the
PenP wild type and mutants were transformed into E.
coli BL21(DE3) for protein expression. The detailed
procedure for the overexpression and purification of the PenP enzymes
is mentioned in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Fluorescence Labeling
Approximately
2 mg of the β-lactamase cysteine mutant was reconstituted in
4 mL of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride. The protein solution was then
incubated at room temperature for 30 min to unfold the mutant. The
pH of the solution was then adjusted to 7.5 with 0.2 M sodium hydroxide.
In parallel, a 20 mM stock solution of fluorescein-5-maleimide was
prepared by dissolving it in dimethylformamide. A 10-fold molar excess
of fluorescein-5-maleimide from the stock solution was then added
into the protein solution. This mixture was then stirred at room temperature
for 2–4 h in the dark to allow labeling of the mutant. Following
the labeling reaction, excess label was then removed by dialyzing
the labeling mixture against 1 L of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 7.0) at 4 °C with a dialysis tubing of 12 kDa cut-off size.
Upon the removal of guanidine hydrochloride from the reaction mixture
by dialysis, enzymes were allowed to refold into their native structures.
The refolded fluorophore-conjugated protein was stored at −20
°C.

4.4 β-Lactamase Activity Assay
The activity of the β-lactamase wild type and mutants was measured
by the spectrophotometric method using a PerkinElmer Lambda Bio 20
UV/visible spectrometer. All assays were performed at 20 °C in
50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). Initial velocities of substrate
hydrolysis were monitored by an increase in absorbance at 405 nm for
CENTA and 500 nm for nitrocefin for the first 5 min. The extinction
coefficients of CENTA and nitrocefin are 6400 and 15 900 M–1 cm–1, respectively. Kinetic parameters
(Km and kcat) were determined by fitting the initial rates of substrate hydrolysis
to the Michaelis–Menten equation with nonlinear regression
(Enzyme Kinetics, Trinity software).

4.5 Thermal Denaturation Study
Thermal
denaturation of the MBP-β-lactamase was studied by monitoring
the far-UV molar ellipticity at 222 nm at a scan rate of 50 nm/min
in 5 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Data were recorded as a function
of increasing temperature with a rate of 1 °C/min over the temperature
range of 20–85 °C. The protein concentration of the samples
was in the range of 150–200 μg/mL.

4.6 Thermal Inactivation Study
β-Lactamases
were incubated at 50 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0).
Samples were withdrawn at different time intervals and immediately
cooled on ice. The residual activities of the enzymes in hydrolyzing
nitrocefin at 20 °C were then measured in duplicate.

4.7 Fluorescence Measurements
Fluorescence
measurements were performed on a PerkinElmer LS50B spectrofluorimeter
at 20 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0). Excitation and
emission wavelengths were at 494 and 515 nm, respectively. Both excitation
and emission slit widths were 5 nm and scan speed was 250 nm/min.

4.8 Detection of Antibiotics in Serum
Penicillin G was first dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)
and then serially diluted to give stock solutions at different concentrations.
After that, antibiotic-containing mouse serum samples were prepared
by mixing an aliquot of 5 μL of penicillin G from the stock
solution. For the control with the omission of antibiotics, PBS was
added to the serum to substitute penicillin G. For the fluorescence
detection of antibiotics, 1 μL of the serum sample was added
to 0.1 μM of PenP-E166Cf/N170Q in 50 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.0) in a quartz cuvette. The reaction mixture was mixed
manually, and its fluorescence signal was acquired by using a Cary
Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrometer (Agilent, US). Excitation and emission
wavelengths were 494 and 515 nm, respectively. Both excitation and
emission slits were set at 5 nm. All measurements were conducted in
triplicate at room temperature.

4.9 Detection of Antibiotics in Milk
The milk sample was purchased from the local supermarket in Hong
Kong. To prepare antibiotic-containing milk, penicillin G was first dissolved
in the fresh milk and then serially diluted with milk to give stock
solution at various concentrations. Milk with the omission of penicillin
G was served as the negative control for the detection. Prior to the
analysis, 5 mL of the milk sample was added with 0.4 mL of 10% trichloroacetic
acid (TCA; Sigma) in a sterilized centrifuge tube. The solution was
vortexed briefly for 5 min. Then, it was subjected to centrifugation
at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The clear supernatant was collected and filtered
by using a 0.22 μm-syringe filter (PALL; acrodisc; hydrophilic
polyethersulfone PES). Five microliters of the filtrate was subjected
to the fluorescence assay. The condition and settings for the fluorescence
measurement were the same as the aforementioned for fluorescence detection
in mouse serum. All measurements were performed in triplicate.
