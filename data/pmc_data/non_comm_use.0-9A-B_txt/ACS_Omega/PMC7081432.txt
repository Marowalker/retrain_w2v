Methyl palmitate (or triglyceride)
was converted into C15 olefin with remarkable selectivity
using nickel–molybdenum
oxides on the mesoporous titanosilicate support. The olefin has one
carbon atom less than the acid portion of the ester. A new catalyst
NiMoK/TS-1 was synthesized in which the effect of acidity of supports
and molybdenum loading on the decarboxylation conversion along with
product selectivity was investigated in methyl palmitate conversion
into C15 olefin. The prepared catalysts were analyzed using
ammonia-temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, scanning electron
microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) techniques. The reaction was carried out using a vapor-phase
fixed-bed downflow reactor system at atmospheric pressure. The NiMoK/TS-1
catalyst at a weight hourly space velocity (WHSV) of 5.6/h was found
to be selective toward C15 olefin. The catalyst was stable
up to 15 h, and it can be regenerated with no considerable decrease
in the activity even after fourth reuse. Beyond 653 K, the conversion
of methyl palmitate increased but the selectivity for C15 products and C15 olefin was decreased.

1 Introduction
The
use of biomass to produce fuels is required to fulfill the
energy demands of the world today, due to the high industrialization
and urbanization and the rapid depletion of nonrenewable resources.
The major part of the world’s energy is consumed by the transportation
sector due to the high amount of fuel requirements, which is nearly
unavoidable. Recent studies are therefore directed toward the synthesis
of biofuels from renewable resources. Naturally occurring oils and
fats composed of C12–C24 saturated/unsaturated
fatty acid esters can readily reduce the energy crisis and maintain
the ecological carbon balance. Biofuels are categorized as first-,
second-, third-, or fourth-generation fuels depending on the feedstock
from which they are produced. Biofuels made from food crops and manufactured
from various biomass derived from different inedible plants and animal
materials fall under the first- and second-generation categories.1 Fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) biodiesels, which
are also called as first-generation biofuels, help in decreasing greenhouse
gas emissions, decreasing the dependence on fossil fuels, and improving
rural agricultural economies. On the other hand, FAME biofuels manufactured
from vegetable oils have disadvantages like high freezing point, high
cloud point, high viscosity, high oxygen content, and low calorific
value.2 C15–C18 hydrocarbons produced from saturated/unsaturated fatty acid esters
can be divided into first- or second-generation biofuels depending
on edible or inedible feedstock used to produce them. These hydrocarbons
with high cetane values are used as additives for blending with biodiesels
to improve their properties.3 The naturally
occurring triglycerides or fatty acids or fatty acid methyl esters
undergo the following catalytic deoxygenation reactions: (1) hydrodeoxygenation
(HDO) exothermic reaction with removal of oxygen in the form of water,
leaving behind n-alkane with the same carbon number
as the corresponding fatty acid, (2) decarbonylation (DCO) and decarboxylation
(DCO2) endothermic reactions with elimination of oxygen
in the form of CO and water or CO2, respectively, to give
hydrocarbons with one carbon atom less compared to the original fatty
acid (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Schematic Representation of HDO, DCO, and DCO2 Reactions
For the past few decades, various heterogeneous
catalysts are being
studied for this deoxygenation, where all HDO, DCO, and DCO2 reactions occur simultaneously in the presence of hydrogen to yield
paraffins and olefins. Temperature, pressure, and H2/substrate
ratio affect these reaction pathways. High pressure, H2/substrate ratio, and low temperatures are favorable for HDO product
selectivity.4 Sulfided NiMo/γ-alumina
is a widely studied catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation, which resulted
in around 40% selectivity of HDO products.4−7 DCO2 and DCO products
were obtained parallelly with 10% olefin selectivity.8 Ni or NiMo supported on other more acidic supports such
as AlSBA-15 and SAPO-11 were studied to yield iso-alkanes.9−11 CoMo over alumina and MCM-42 were reported to convert rapeseed oil
into hydrocarbons by hydrodeoxygenation and hydrodecarboxylation mechanisms.12,13 Ni/ZrO2, Ni/ZnO–Al2O3, and
NiAl2O4 spinels have shown good conversion of
fatty acids into straight-chain alkanes with different alkane selectivities.14−16 Precious metals like Pt, Pd, and Ru were studied to improve the
selectivity and produce identical alkanes. Platinum supported over
alumina or SAPO-11 was reported for deoxygenation of oleic acid with
a maximum 35% selectivity of n-heptadecane.17 Ru/ZSM-5 was used for hydrodeoxygenation of
methyl stearate giving 64.3% of n-C17 and
13% of n-C18 alkanes.18 5% Pd/C is reported to give the highest conversion of around
100% and selectivity of around 97% for n-heptadecane
from stearic acid and n-pentadecane from palmitic
acid in the presence of hydrogen.19−21 In all of these studies,
a huge amount of hydrogen (around 3 moles per mole of feedstock) is
used for deoxygenation.

Though HDO has many advantages, this
high-pressure H2 operation seems to be undesirable because
it requires high H2 consumption and expensive facilities
to make the process
explosive-free and safe. DCO2, on the other hand, can be
produced without hydrogen, and unlike hydrodeoxygenation, it does
not produce water, which may deactivate the catalyst. Some of the
research works by Murzin et al.19,20,22,23 studied decarboxylation of stearic
acid, oleic acid, or methyl oleate in an inert atmosphere without
H2, which ended up in an increased amount of olefins in
the product stream. Na et al.24 introduced
hydrotalcites as decarboxylation catalyst, where almost 98% of oleic
acid was converted into C17 products, but the selectivity
toward n-heptadecene was not focused. Mäki-Arvela
et al.22 yielded heptadecene with 51% selectivity
during the decarboxylation of methyl stearate. Chiappero et al.25 thoroughly studied the decarboxylation reaction
of methyl octanoate and other triglycerides with the PtSnK/SiO2 catalyst, without H2 flow, in the He atmosphere
yielding almost 70–80% olefin products. Stern et al.26 patented a catalyst consisting of nickel and
a metal selected from tin, germanium, and/or lead resulting in 71%
selectivity of α-pentadecene obtained from decarboxylation of
palmitic acid.

Selective conversion of fatty acid methyl esters
or triglycerides
to hydrocarbons, particularly α-olefins, is valuable because
of their applications, not only as biofuels but also in producing
specialty chemicals like polymers and surfactants. Therefore, in the
present work, we have focused on the production of identical long-chain
hydrocarbons from methyl esters and/or triglycerides via decarboxylation
without the use of hydrogen using different supported NiMo catalysts
to achieve high selectivity of olefins in particular. The Ni–Mo–O
catalyst is selected as it can operate at a low conversion but with
a high selectivity in oxidative dehydrogenation reactions (ODH) of
alkanes.27 Titanosilicate (TS-1) is explored
as support material due to its optimum acidic and basic properties,
which helped to control the cracking side products and hence to improve
the selectivity of products.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
2.1.1 Ammonia-Temperature-Programmed
Desorption
(NH3-TPD)
The acidity of support plays an important
role in the selectivity of product as acidity is prone to yield more
cracking products. Ammonia TPD of all supports and catalysts, which
are studied for this conversion were carried out (Figure 1). γ-Alumina has the
highest acidity of 0.79 mmol/g, followed by TS (1:10) and TS-1. TS-1
has the least acidity of 0.121 mmol/g. Nickel and molybdenum oxides
over TS-1 have an acidity of 0.202 mmol/g (Table S1). As doping of potassium decreases the acidic sites of the
catalyst, the acidity is further reduced to 0.176 mmol/g.

Figure 1 NH3-TPD curves for different supports and catalysts
studied.

2.1.2 X-ray
Diffraction (XRD) Analysis
Figure 2 shows the
XRD patterns of TS-1, NiMoK/TS-1, as well as regenerated NiMoK/TS-1.
The XRD pattern of TS-1 showed diffraction peaks resembling the MFI
topology with 2θ values of 7.9, 8.8, 23.0, 23.9, and 24.4 (Figure 2A).28,29 Impregnation of nickel, molybdenum, and potassium has not changed
the topology of the TS-1 (Figure 2B). No extra peaks of Ni or Mo oxides were observed
though they were present in significant quantity. Little shifts in
the peak positions as well as increase in peak intensities were observed
in NiMoK/TS-1. The Ni and Mo oxide species are thus said to be well
dispersed inside the pores of TS-1, which can be also supported by
the transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image provided (Figure 8). Average crystallite sizes of TS-1 as well as NiMoK/TS-1
were calculated using the Scherrer formula to be 19.89 and 23.38 nm,
respectively. The regenerated catalyst also retains its original phase
with the said 2θ values as well as an average crystallite size
of 23.32 nm.

NiMoK/TS-1 (C).

2.1.3 Fourier
Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy
FTIR spectra of TS-1
and NiMoK/TS-1 were recorded (Figure 3). The Si–O bending
mode and the stretching vibration of the structural double five-membered
ring in the TS-1 framework are identified by bands at wavenumbers
of 450 and 550 cm–1, respectively. These two bands
confirm the formation of the MFI topology in all samples, which matches
with the XRD results. The band at 968 cm–1 can possibly
be assigned to stretching of Si–O–Ti, which can be considered
as evidence of the presence of titanium in the TS-1 framework. Metal-oxide-loaded
TS-1 does not have any extra peak but differs in intensities of peaks
at 801 and 968 cm–1. The relative intensities of
the bands at 968 and 801 cm–1 (I968/801) were used to compare the relative contents of
framework titanium in different catalyst samples.29,30I968/801 is higher (1.04) for TS-1 than
for NiMoK/TS-1 (0.70).

2.1.4 Surface
Area Analysis
The N2 adsorption–desorption
method was used to find the
textural properties of TS-1, NiMoK/TS-1, as well as regenerated NiMoK/TS-1
(Figure 4). The adoption
curve obtained was elongated S-type and convex to the x-axis. This is type V isotherm indicating mesoporous materials produced
by the unrestricted multilayer formation process with weak interactions
between adsorbate and adsorbent. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of TS-1 was 381.5 m2/g with a pore volume
of 0.42 cm3/g and pore size of 10.5 nm, whereas NiMoK/TS-1
exhibited a BET surface area of 419.2 m2/g, a pore volume
of 0.34 cm3/g, and a pore size of 6.9 nm. An increase in
surface area can be attributed to the additional surfaces of Ni and
Mo oxide particles. Similarly, the decrease in pore volume and pore
size was due to the adsorption of Mo and Ni oxides into the pores.

and Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 (B).

2.1.5 X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS)
XPS analysis was performed to ensure the elemental composition,
chemical state, and electronic state of the elements existing from
the surface of the catalyst material.The high-resolution spectra of
Si 2p in TS-1 had a binding energy of 102.4 eV before the impregnation
of Ni and Mo oxides, but after the impregnation, the peak was shifted
to 100.6 eV (Figure 5I). Similarly, the core spectra of Ti 2p in TS-1 (Figure 5II) showed the binding energies
for Ti 2p3/2 and Ti 2p1/2 (457.7 and 463.4 eV,
respectively). While after loading of Mo and Ni oxides, the curves
moved slightly to lower binding energies of 455.9 and 462.2 eV, respectively.
This confirmed that the bond strengths of Si–O and Ti–O
were changed slightly due to the incorporation of metal oxides. The
wide spectra of NiMoK/TS-1 (1:30) are shown in Figure 6. Mo 3d (Mo 3d5/2) had the highest
binding energies at 233 and 229.7 eV, respectively, corresponding
to the oxidation states Mo+6 and Mo+4. The peaks
between of 850 and 880 eV were attributed to Ni 2p, with multiplate
splits at 853 and 871.2 eV for Ni 2p3/2 of Ni+2 with a satellite peak at 859.5 eV. A satellite peak of Ni 2p1/2 at 878.7 eV was also observed. High-resolution spectra
of Mo 3d and Ni 2p are provided in the Supporting Information (Figures S1 and S2). As potassium was added at
a very low concentration, it could not be seen in the XPS spectra.
Elemental quantification of Si, Ti, Mo, and Ni provided by the area
under the curve method was found to be 27.72, 1.18, 3.05, and 1.55%
respectively.

2.1.6 Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Transmission
Electron Microscopy (TEM) Analysis
SEM images of TS-1 and
NiMoK/TS-1 are shown in Figure 7. The surface morphology of TS-1 (1:30) was seen to be retained
after loading of nickel, molybdenum, and potassium. This indicates
that the metal oxides were not present on the surface of the support
TS-1 but present inside the pores of support. The fact is also concluded
from the XRD patterns and TEM images provided. Figure 8i,ii shows the TEM images of TS-1 and Ni5Mo10K/TS-1, where we can clearly see the loaded nickel and molybdenum
oxide particles onto the support TS-1. The images show that the diffraction
fringes of the zeolite lattice can be distinguished, which denotes
that the reorganized TS-1 materials keep the high crystallinity degree
after metal-oxide loading, confirming the results obtained by XRD.
The particle size of TS-1 was confirmed by TEM images. It was found
to have approximately uniform spheroidal morphology with a particle
size of around 150–200 nm. The average particle size of Ni
and Mo oxides was 10–20 nm. As lattice fringes of these metal
oxides were also observable, they can be said to be present inside
the pores of TS-1 supporting the fact that no extra peaks due to crystalline
Ni and Mo oxides were observed in XRD.

and NiMoK/TS-1 (B).

2.1.7 Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)
Thermal
stabilities of catalysts were analyzed by thermogravimetric
analysis (Figure 9).
TS-1 and NiMoK/TS-1 were calcined at 600 °C before TG analysis.
After an initial weight loss of ≤8% below 100 °C, the
catalyst was found to be stable up to 600 °C. The initial weight
loss might be due to the removal of water.

2.2 Catalytic
Conversion of Methyl Palmitate
2.2.1 Catalyst
Screening
MoK/alumina,
Ni5Mo5/TS (1:10), Ni5Mo5/TS-1, Ni5Mo10/TS-1, and Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 catalysts were synthesized and screened for methyl
palmitate conversion. All reactions were carried out at 380 °C,
with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, catalyst loading of 1.5 g, and initial
feed of 0.2 M. It has been found that as the acidity of the catalyst
was decreased, the conversion of methyl palmitate was reduced, but
the selectivity toward C15 hydrocarbons, including paraffins
and specifically olefins, was increased (Table 1). This was inferred due to the formation
of more cracking products when acidic catalysts were used. When MoK/alumina
and Ni5Mo5/TS (1:10) having comparatively higher
acidity were used as catalysts, the selectivity for C15 products was found to be less due to the formation cracking products.
The catalysts Ni5Mo5/TS-1, Ni5Mo10/TS-1, and Ni5Mo10-K/TS-1 had a good
selectivity of 88.3, 92.0, and 95.0%, respectively, toward C15 compounds. The selectivities of the α-olefinic C15 compound were 67.7, 82.2, and 87.1%, respectively. It can be seen
that doping of base potassium on Ni5Mo10/TS-1
decreased the conversion from 38.7 to 28.2% but increased the selectivity
of C15 products as well as the selectivity of C15 olefin. According to this study, Ni5Mo10K/TS-1
was found to give the maximum selectivity of 87.1% toward the C15 olefinic compound because of its lowest acidity.

Conversion of Methyl Palmitate and Selectivity of C15 Products

2.2.2 Effect of Catalyst Loading
Different
amounts of catalyst in the range of 1–2.5 g were studied (Figure 10). All reactions
were carried out at 380 °C, with a flow rate of 0.2 mL/min and
an initial feed of 0.2 M concentration. As the catalyst loading increases,
the number of active sites increases, and so the conversion of methyl
palmitate increases. To study the effect of catalyst loading, the
fixed-bed reactor was packed with 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 g of catalyst,
and the conversions of methyl palmitate were 23.2, 28.2, 31.6, and
33.5%, respectively. But the selectivities of C15 compounds
were decreased as 95.2, 95, 92.4, and 90.7%, respectively. This can
be attributed to the formation of cracking products due to the increase
in acidic sites present on the catalyst as well as due to the higher
residence time of methyl palmitate because of increased catalyst bed
height. Consequently, the selectivity of C15 olefinic product
was decreased as the catalyst loading was increased and found to be
almost similar to 1 and 1.5 g of catalyst loading with a marginal
difference. Thus, a catalyst loading of 1.5 g was optimized for further
reactions giving the maximum yield of C15 olefinic product.

Figure 10 Effect
of catalyst loading on conversion and selectivity. The reaction
is carried out in a fixed-bed reactor using Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 as catalyst with a fixed flow rate of 0.2 mL/min at 380 °C
and hexane as the solvent, where the concentration of methyl palmitate
is 0.2 M.

2.2.3 Effect
of Weight Hourly Space Velocity (WHSV)
The effect of WHSV
(h–1) was studied by changing
the feed flow rates in mL/min (Figure 11). An increase in flow rate decreases the
residence time of reactant on the catalyst surface, which results
in the decreased conversion of reactant. Different feed flow rates
such as 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, and 0.3 mL/min were studied so as to get
the maximum selectivity of olefinic C15 products. All reactions
were carried out at 380 °C, with the same catalyst loading of
1.5 g and initial feed of 0.2 M concentration. The WHSVs for the said
flow rates were 4.2, 5.6, 7.0, and 8.4 h–1, respectively.
With an increase in WHSV, the conversion of methyl palmitate was decreased
by 30.4, 28.2, 26.5, and 25.5%. But the C15 selectivity
was found to be less at 4.2 h–1 because of the formation
of more cracking products due to the high residence time of methyl
palmitate over the catalyst surface. An increase in WHSV to 5.6 h–1 increased the C15 selectivity to 95% and
remained almost constant for all further WHSVs. As a result, the selectivity
of the C15 α-olefin product was highest at the WHSV
of 5.6 h–1, and therefore this WHSV was used to
carry out further experiments.

Figure 11 Effect of WHSV (h–1) on conversion and selectivity.
The reaction is carried out using a fixed-bed reactor, using Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 as catalyst, with a catalyst loading
of 1.5 g at 380 °C, using hexane as solvent, where the concentration
of methyl palmitate is 0.2 M.

2.2.4 Effect of Feed Concentration
The
concentration of methyl palmitate in feed was an important parameter
to affect the conversion. The feed concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.3,
and 0.4 M were studied at 5.6 h–1 WHSV, resulting
into conversions of 30.7, 28.2, 15.4, and 8.9%, respectively (Figure 12). As the feed
concentration increased, with a catalyst loading of 1.5 g at 380 °C,
the conversion of methyl palmitate was decreased. At 0.2 M concentration,
the selectivity of C15 olefin was found to be maximum,
i.e., 87.1%, at higher concentrations, the selectivity remains unaffected.
This due to the limited number of active sites present for increasing
moles of methyl palmitate. Though increase in concentration has shown
a decrease in concentration, it does not conclude that the rate of
the reaction also decreased. The rate of reaction remained almost
constant for all of the concentrations. Thus, the concentration of
0.2 mol/L in hexane was selected for further study.

Figure 12 Effect of feed concentration
(M) on conversion and selectivity.
The reaction is conducted in a fixed-bed reactor using Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 as catalyst, with a WHSV of 5.6 h–1 and catalyst loading of 1.5 g at 380 °C, using hexane as solvent.

2.2.5 Effect of Temperature
The temperature
was found to be the most important parameter for this reaction so
as to result in good selectivity. Temperatures ranging from 340 to
420 °C were studied for better conversion and selectivity (Figure 13). This was due
to the formation of cracking products obtained by thermal cracking.
All reactions were carried out with a catalyst loading of 1.5 g, feed
flow rate of 0.2 mL/min, and initial feed of 0.2 M concentration.
As the temperature was increased, thermal cracking of methyl palmitate
took place to lower the selectivity of C15 and so the final
selectivity of the C15 olefinic compound. Beyond 380 °C,
at 400 and 420 °C, the conversion of methyl palmitate was increased
from 28.2 to 33.35 and 39.4%, respectively, but the selectivity of
C15 products was decreased from 87.1 to 81.6 and 69.8%,
respectively. Therefore, 380 °C was considered as the optimum
temperature.

Figure 13 Effect of temperature on conversion and selectivity. The
reaction
is conducted in a fixed-bed reactor, using Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 as catalyst, with a WHSV of 5.6 h–1 using
hexane as solvent, where the concentration of methyl palmitate is
0.2 M.

2.2.6 Effect
of Hydrogen
An experiment
using the same Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 catalyst with a
WHSV of 5.6 h–1, feed concentration of 0.2 M, and
temperature of 380 °C was carried out in the presence of hydrogen
with a H2/feed molar ratio of 5, to give C15 as well as C16 paraffins and olefins. The C15 paraffin and olefin selectivities were 58.2 and 10.7%, respectively,
and the C16 paraffin and olefin selectivities were 26.9
and 4.2%, respectively. This concludes that the presence of hydrogen
facilitates both deoxygenation and decarboxylation reactions simultaneously.

2.2.7 Time on Stream Study
The activity
and stability of the Ni5Mo10K/TS catalyst were
studied by carrying out the reaction till 40 h, with the same catalyst
bed throughout (Figure 14). The catalyst was found to be stable and active up to the
first 15 h and resulted in 27.3% conversion at the 15th hour. After
that, the conversion started to reduce at the 40th hour, and the conversion
was found to be only 10.5%. The reduction in conversion after a certain
time was because of the deactivation of catalyst due to coking and
sintering. Due to deactivation, very few active sites were available
for the reactants to adsorb, resulting in very less conversion. The
selectivity of C15 products also started to reduce after
15–20 h. Due to the deposition of coke on the catalyst surface,
cracking was favored forming Cn (n < 15) products, and also the product composition contains
more of paraffins than olefins. Overall, the selectivity of the C15 olefinic product was 86.5% at 15 h, and after that it started
reducing; at the 40th hour, it was only 48.2%.

using Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 as catalyst, with a WHSV
of 5.6 h–1, catalyst loading of 1.5 g at 380 °C,
using hexane as solvent, where the concentration of methyl palmitate
is 0.2 M.

2.2.8 Regeneration
and Reusability of the Catalyst
For regeneration of the catalyst,
the spent catalyst was first
washed with N2 gas with a flow rate of 100 mL/min for 1
h at 200 °C. The dry catalyst thus obtained was washed with isopropyl
alcohol to wash out the adsorbed material from the catalyst. Then,
it was calcined at 600 °C for 4 h. The loss of catalyst during
this regeneration process was calculated and made up with fresh catalyst
so as to get the same catalyst loading. The catalyst can also be regenerated
simply by calcining at 600 °C inside the reactor. In this manner,
the catalyst reusability study was done four times (Figure 15). It was found that there
was no considerable difference in the conversion of methyl palmitate
and the selectivity of the C15 olefinic product. Hence,
Ni5Mo10K/TS-1 was a robust and reusable catalyst.

of 5.6 h–1, catalyst loading of 1.5 g at 380 °C,
using hexane as solvent, where the concentration of methyl palmitate
is 0.2 M.

2.3 Kinetic
Model
The possible mechanism
of conversion of methyl palmitate over metal-oxide surface to α-pentadecene
is shown in Scheme 2. In this mechanism, Mn+ denotes metal
M with oxidation state n+. According to the stated
mechanism, methyl palmitate first gets adsorbed on the active metal
M of catalyst, thus increasing the oxidation state of metal to n + 1. Oxygen from metal oxide then abstracts proton from
the 14th carbon of methyl palmitate to yield CO2 and olefinic
product. This decarboxylation process leaves the methyl group on M.
On further desorption of methane, metal M retains its original oxidation
state (i.e., n+). Figure S4 shows the gas chromatograph of gaseous products obtained, which
supports the proposed mechanism.

Scheme 2 Possible Mechanism of Methyl Palmitate
to C15 α-Olefin
Conversion
The conversion of methyl palmitate
to C15 products is
a parallel reaction with paraffin and olefin as products. It contains
methyl palmitate (M) as a reactant and C15 paraffin (P)
and C15 olefin (O) as products. Gaseous co-products (G)
can be neglected.    The chemisorption of methyl palmitate on vacant
catalytic site (S) is the first step followed by other reactions. 1  The chemisorbed methyl palmitate (MS) then
undergoes two parallel reactions to produce C15 paraffin
(P) and olefin (O) as depicted below 2   3  The final rate of reaction of methyl
palmitate
M (mol/h·g-cat) assuming both of the parallel reactions 2 and 3 as rate-controlling is given by 4  where CS is the
concentration of vacant sites (S) calculated from the concentration
of total site (Ct), adsorption equilibrium
constants (Ki), and concentrations of
relevant species (Ci) 5   6  According
to eqs 5 and 6, eq 4 becomes 7  Considering all species are weakly
adsorbed
and if ∑KiCi ≪ 1, the above reaction rate equation becomes 8   9  where the overall rate constant was 10  When eq 9 is integrated, we get the following equation for a fixed-bed
vapor-phase catalytic reactor 11  A plot of −ln (1 – XM) vs W/FMo was made
as a function of temperature to get a very good
fit (Figure 16). This
confirms the first order of the reaction.

Figure 16 First-order fixed-bed
reactor plot −ln (1 – XM) vs W/FMo for
the conversion of methyl palmitate.

Rate constants at different temperatures, 613, 633, 653, and 673
K, were calculated. The Arrhenius plot was made to calculate the activation
energy of the reaction (Figure 17). The value of the apparent energy of activation was
10.11 kcal/mol. It can be concluded that this reaction was essentially
kinetically controlled.

Figure 17 Arrhenius plot of ln k vs 1/T for the conversion of methyl palmitate.

To find k1 and k2 individually, we have assumed that only one
reaction occurs
at a time. The rate equations for the synthesis of paraffin and olefin
separately using a fixed-bed vapor-phase catalytic reactor are derived
from eqs 2 and 3, respectively 12   13  Plots of −ln (1 – XM) vs W/FMo were made as a function of temperature to find out k1 and k2 at different
temperatures (Figure 18). The values of k′ obtained in Figure 16 were found to
be almost matching with k1 + k2. The marginal difference obtained may be attributed
to the formation of other side products.

Figure 18 First-order fixed-bed
reactor plot −ln (1 – XM) vs W/FMo for
the conversion of methyl palmitate to C15 paraffin (A)
and olefin (B).

The Arrhenius plots
(Figure 19) were made
to calculate the activation energies of
paraffin as well as olefin formation. The activation energy of paraffin
production from methyl palmitate is 10.31 kcal/mol, and the activation
energy of olefin production from methyl palmitate is 9.46 kcal/mol.
Thus, both the reactions can be said to be kinetically controlled.
The activation energy analysis suggested that the production of the
C15 olefinic product from methyl palmitate is more temperature-sensitive
than the production of the C15 paraffin from methyl palmitate.

plot of ln k1 and
ln k2 vs 1/T for
the conversion of methyl palmitate to C15 paraffin (A)

3 Conclusions
Catalytic decarboxylation of fatty acid methyl esters and triglycerides
is a promising route to produce “green” diesel fuel
or hydrocarbons, which can substitute for petrochemical feedstock
or specialty chemicals. The reported catalyst NiMoK/TS-1 is found
to be efficient to selectively produce decarboxylated products, especially
α-olefins without the use of hydrogen. WHSV of 5.6 h–1 and temperature of 380 °C were found to be optimum for this
reaction when the feed concentration is 0.2 M. Cyclic and aromatic
as well as cracking products were eliminated to selectively get 95%
C15 hydrocarbons with 87% of 1-pentadecene (i.e., C15 α-olefin). Though the single-pass conversion is less,
reactive distillation enables easy removal of products from the unreacted
feed, which can be recirculated through the reactor.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Methyl
palmitate (97% pure)
and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) were obtained from Alfa Aesar,
India. Titanium isopropoxide 98% (TTIP), tetrapropylammonuim hydroxide
solution 1.0 M (TPAOH), and nickel (II) nitrate hexahydrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) were obtained from Avra
Chemicals, India. Ammonium heptamolybdate ((NH4)6Mo7O24) was purchased from Thomas Baker Chemicals,
India.

4.2 Catalyst Preparation
TS-1 represents
TS (1:30) with a 1:30 (w/w) ratio of TiO2/SiO2, which also means a 1:23.5 (w/w) ratio of Ti/Si in the gel. Similarly,
TS (1:10) represents a 1:10 (w/w) ratio of TiO2/SiO2 and a 1:7.35 (w/w) ratio of Ti/Si in the gel. The procedure
of synthesizing crystalline support TS-1 is given below.

Tetraethyl
orthosilicate (TEOS) (49 g) was added with 60 mL of aqueous tetrapropylammonium
hydroxide (1 M TPAOH) for hydrolysis of the TEOS, resulting in a pH
of 12.5. To this mixture, 1.67 g of titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) solution
prepared in dry isopropyl alcohol was added dropwise with vigorous
stirring. The clear liquid obtained was then stirred for 1 h to hydrolyze
TEOS and TTIP completely. Finally, the remaining 20 mL of TPAOH solution
was slowly added to the above mixture. This mixture was then stirred
for about 3 h at 348–353 K to remove the alcohol. The chemical
composition of the initial gel was  The final mixture
was transferred into a 250
mL Teflon flask and placed into a stainless steel autoclave. Crystallization
was carried out under static hydrothermal conditions at 443 K for
1 day. After crystallization, solids were separated by centrifugation
and dried at 373 K for 5 h.

Nickel nitrate hexahydrate and ammonium
heptamolybdate were simultaneously
impregnated onto TS-1 by the incipient wetness impregnation method
in appropriate amounts. The materials were then calcined at 600 °C
for 5 h to get catalysts Ni5Mo5/TS-1 and Ni5Mo10/TS-1. During the synthesis of Ni5Mo10K/TS-1, KNO3 is impregnated after metallic
precursors so as to get 0.5% (w/w) loading of potassium. TS (1:30)
is henceforth denoted by TS-1.

4.3 Decarboxylation
Reaction
The decarboxylation
reactions are carried out in a fixed-bed vapor-phase reactor. A detailed
description of the reactor is provided in the Supporting Information. Single-pass experiments were carried
out for studying the effects of different parameters such as concentration,
catalyst loading, temperature, WHSV, etc. N2 was used as
a carrier gas. Hexane was used as a solvent for methyl palmitate.
The used catalyst was regenerated by calcining it at 600 °C for
4 h.

4.4 Analysis of Products and Characterization
of Catalysts
Catalyst characterizations were done using different
techniques, namely, temperature-programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
Detailed specifications of these instruments are provided in the Supporting Information.

The product samples
of decarboxylation reactions were analyzed using GC with a TG5MS capillary
column with dimensions of 0.25 mm × 30 m (Thermo 1110 model).
The product identification was done using GCMS (Thermo Scientific
ISQLT 1300; capillary column TG5MS; 0.25 mm × 30 m). The methods
used for calculating % concentration and % selectivity are also provided
in the Supporting Information.
