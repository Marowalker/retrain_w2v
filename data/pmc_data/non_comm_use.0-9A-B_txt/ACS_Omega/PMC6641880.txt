Electrical conductivity
is one of the properties required for an
active material, and it is extremely essential to exert its potential.
In the present study, the strategy of coating a metal at a single
particle level by an electroless deposition method was applied to
enhance the cycling performance of phosphorus-based negative electrodes
for Na-ion batteries. The deposition morphology and composition of
the Ni coating layer were characterized by field-emission scanning
electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy, and
X-ray diffraction. In the 5 wt % Ni coating, an amorphous Ni layer
of several nanometers thickness was homogeneously formed on the phosphorus
surface, whereas a shell layer having a 200 nm thickness was formed
in the order of Ni12P5, NiP2, NiP3, and metallic Ni from the surface toward the center in the
30 wt % Ni coating. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopic measurements
clarified that the good electron transport proceeded throughout the
developed conduction pathway to promote the phase transition to trisodium
phosphide (Na3P), leading to a high reversible capacity
for phosphorus; the as-prepared black phosphorus showed only a reversible
capacity of 140 mA h g–1 at the 60th cycle, whereas
the 30 wt % Ni-coated composite delivered a relatively high capacity
of 780 mA h g(P)–1. In addition, the expansion ratio
of the electrode after the 30th desodiation was the lowest among the
three kinds of electrodes. By contrast, cracks and exfoliation of
the active material layer from the current collector were confirmed
in the as-prepared black phosphorus. These results demonstrate that
the upgraded performance accomplished using the 30 wt % Ni-coated
composite with the Ni/Ni–P layer is due to the synergetic effects
of the electron conduction channel and a buffer matrix against a large
volumetric change (∼400%) in phosphorus during the charge–discharge
reactions.

Introduction
Toward the realization
of a low-carbon society, Li-ion batteries
(LIBs) have been not only used as power supplies for electric vehicles
but also connected to smart grids. The worldwide popularization and
rising demand for LIBs, however, require serious situations to be
solved, such as the depletion of Li resources.1,2 As
one answer to the problem, the development of new rechargeable batteries
is eagerly anticipated. Na-ion batteries are in the spotlight because
of their low cost and the high natural abundance of Na, and these
batteries utilize the same system as LIBs from the viewpoint that
the host materials absorb/release monovalent alkali-metal ions. To
handle the rapidly growing demand for applications in large-scale
systems, advanced performances, such as high capacity and long cycle
life, are required in host materials. With regard to the negative
electrode materials, the development is focused on group 14 and group
15 elements, with the exception of nitrogen (N) and arsenic (As).3−11 In particular, tin (Sn)12−15 and phosphorus (P)16−26 have attracted much attention as alternatives to carbon-based materials,27−30 which show a reversible capacity of ∼300 mA h g–1. Among the allotropes of phosphorus, red and black phosphorus can
electrochemically react with Na to form a binary alloy.16,31 The formation of the most Na-rich phase, that is, the transformation
of phosphorus to trisodium phosphide (Na3P), leads to a
high theoretical capacity of 2596 mA h g–1, which
is 10 times greater than the reversible capacity obtained from hard
carbon.28,32 There is, however, a critical issue concerning
the poor cycling performance. Because of the large size of the Na-ion
(Shannon’s ionic radius: 1.02 Å), the volume of phosphorus
expands and contracts by ca. 400% during the sodiation and desodiation
reactions,16 which causes electrical isolation
that is involved in the pulverization and peeling of the active material
layer from the current collector. This is the remaining barrier to
achieving a high electrode performance in phosphorus-based materials.
In addition, phosphorus has an insufficient conductivity, which decreases
the utilization of an active material. The use of a metal phosphide
(MxPy) is
effective to improve the cycling performance of phosphorus-based electrodes
by the synergetic effect.33 For instance,
Sn4P3 undergoes a phase separation in the first
cycle to form metallic Sn and phosphorus, in which Sn complements
the poor electronic conductivity of phosphorus and the electrochemically
formed Na–P acts as a shielding matrix against the aggregation
of Sn.34−37 On the other hand, Li et al. reported that a favorable cycling performance
was achieved in mechanically prepared CuP2.38 They demonstrated that CuP2 undergoes
a phase separation to form elemental phosphorus and metallic Cu, and
that, the resulting dispersed Cu nanoparticles serve as highly conductive
electronic channels to enable fast electrochemical sodiation of phosphorus.
In addition, Monconduit et al. clarified that the charge–discharge
of NiP3 proceeds together with a conversion reaction to
show an initial reversible capacity of 1022 mA h g–1 and a good cycling performance with negligible capacity fading over
15 cycles (loss of 15%).39 This is also
probably because of the enhanced electrical conductivity granted by
the transition metal and even the buffer effect to the stress induced
by the significantly large phosphorus volume change during the sodiation/desodiation
reactions. Thus, the electrical conductivity of the active materials
is a pre-eminent important key factor to improve the electrode performance.
In fact, when electrons move from a current collector to an active
material on the side close to a counter electrode, they are following
electron transfers at the interfaces (Figure S1, Supporting Information): (i) between a current collector and
an active material, (ii) between the active materials, and (iii) between
a conductive additive and an active material. These transfer paths
inevitably include the conduction in the active materials, that is,
the electrical conductivity strongly affects the electrode performance.
However, the application of such a transition metal phosphide imposes
a limitation on the substantive capacity because the phosphorus content
becomes relatively low. In the present study, we therefore attempted
to coat the phosphorus powder with Ni on a single particle level by
electroless deposition as a method of imparting electrical conductivity
to enhance the cycling performance of phosphorus-based electrodes.
Herein, we discuss the influence of the composition and deposition
morphology on the electrochemical Na-insertion/extraction properties.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis
Black phosphorus was prepared by the mechanical
milling (MM) method using a high-energy planetary ball mill (Classic
Line P-6, FRITSCH) in an argon atmosphere. Red phosphorus powder (Sigma-Aldrich,
97%) was used as the starting material and was placed in a stainless
steel pot with five stainless steel balls (diameter: 15 mm). The weight
ratio of the balls to the red phosphorus powder was set to 30:1. The
MM time and rotation speed were 30 h and 380 rpm (6.33 Hz), respectively.
Ni-coated phosphorus was synthesized by electroless deposition according
to the following steps, including pretreatments. (1) Sensitization:
black phosphorus powder (5 g L–1) was immersed in
4.4 × 10–4 mol dm–3 (M) SnCl2·2H2O + 0.12 M HCl solution to adsorb Sn2+ on the particles. (2) Activation: Sn-adsorbed phosphorus
was added to a solution of 5.6 × 10–4 M PdCl2 + 0.12 M HCl, where Pd catalytic nuclei were formed on the
particle by the displacement of Sn. In both the pretreatments, the
solution temperature and processing time were 25 °C and 30 min,
respectively. (3) Metallization (electroless deposition of Ni): 4.8
× 10–3 M hydrazine monohydrate (N2H4·H2O) as the reducing agent was dripped
into an aqueous solution containing 5.6 × 10–4 M Ni(OOCCH3)2·4H2O as the
Ni source, 1.6 × 10–4 M ethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EDTA·2Na), 4.8 × 10–3 M lactic acid [CH3CH(OH)COOH] as the complexing
agent, and Pd-activated phosphorus powder (1.0 g L–1) under agitation using a magnetic stirrer. After stirring at 80
°C for 60 min, the suspension was filtered and washed with deionized
water. The washed precipitate was dried under vacuum at 80 °C
for 1 h to obtain Ni-coated black phosphorus as the final product.
The above conditions correspond to 5 wt % Ni deposition; therefore,
the concentration of the respective reagents must be increased with
respect to the amount of Ni.

Characterization
The Ni content
was determined by wavelength-dispersive
X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (WDS-XRF; ZSX Primus II, Rigaku).
X-ray diffraction (XRD; SmartLab, Rigaku) with Cu Kα radiation
and Raman microscopy system (T64000; HORIBA, Ltd.) using the 532 nm
line of a Nd:YAG laser were applied to identify the crystal structures
of the samples. Elemental analysis was conducted by X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS; PHI Quantera II, ULVAC-PHI, Inc.) with an X-ray
(monochromatic radiation Al Kα) beam diameter of 100 μm
operated at 25 W. XPS spectra were calibrated using the binding energy
of hydrocarbon (C–C, C–H groups) at 284.6 eV. The Ni-deposition
morphology on black phosphorus was observed by field emission scanning
electron microscopy (FE-SEM; JSM-7000F, JEOL Co., Ltd.) accompanied
by energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and scanning transmission
electron microscopy (STEM; HD2300A, Hitachi).

Electrochemical Measurements
The Ni-coated phosphorus
powder (50 wt %) as the active material was mixed with acetylene black
(AB, 30 wt %), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC, 15 wt %, Mw: 90 000), and styrene butadiene rubber (SBR,
5 wt %). The resulting slurry was uniformly cast onto a Cu foil (18
μm thickness) using a doctor blade and then dried at 80 °C
for 3 h under vacuum. The mass loading of the active material was
approximately 0.5–0.8 mg cm–2. 2032-Type
coin cells consisting of the as-prepared electrode, Na foil (99.90%;
Rare Metallic) as the counter electrode, an electrolyte, and a glass
fiber filter (Whatman GF/A) as the separator were assembled in an
argon-filled glovebox (dew point below −85 °C). The electrolyte
solution consisted of 1.0 M sodium hexafluorophosphate (NaPF6) dissolved in ethylene carbonate (EC) and diethyl carbonate (DEC)
with a volume ratio of 50/50, with or without 5 vol % fluoroethylene
carbonate (FEC; Kanto Denka Kogyo Co., Ltd.). Galvanostatic charge–discharge
tests were carried out in the voltage range of 0.005–1.500
V (vs Na/Na+) at 25 °C, and the current density was
set to 260 mA g–1 (0.1 C). Electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurement was performed using an [electrode|electrolyte|electrode]
symmetric cell in the frequency range of 100 kHz–10 mHz with
an amplitude of 5 mV at 25 °C.40 First,
in separate cells, two identical electrodes including an active material
with the same loading mass were charged (sodiated) up to 0.005 V (vs
Na/Na+) at 0.1 C and were then removed from the cells with
the separators. The two negative electrode sheets were placed face-to-face
in a fresh cell where the voltage was maintained within ±10 μV.

Results and Discussion
Black phosphorus as a base material
was prepared from red phosphorus
by mechanical milling. Among the allotropes of phosphorus, black phosphorus
is nonflammable compared with red phosphorus and is insoluble in solvents.
In addition, black phosphorus has better electrical conductivity than
red phosphorus. Thus, we employed phosphorus as the base material.20 The XRD patterns of the samples reveal that
red phosphorus with a polymeric structure in which P4 tetrahedra41 are joined to each other by covalent bonds is
completely transformed to black phosphorus with a layered two-dimensional
structure20 after the MM process for 10
h (Figure S2, Supporting Information).
The Raman spectra of red phosphorus milled for 10 h show bands that
originate from one out-of-plane mode (A1g) and two in-plane
modes (B2g and A2g)42 of black phosphorus at 360, 431, and 460 cm–1,
which is in agreement with the XRD results (Figure S3, Supporting Information). As far as the condition
(rotation speed: 380 rpm) is concerned, the black phosphorus phase
is formed after 10 h; there is no significant change in the crystallinity,
and only the grain size changed after the subsequent treatment. We
selected the 30 h-milled phosphorus as the raw material and covered
the phosphorus with Ni to the amount of 5, 10, 20, and 30 wt % by
electroless deposition. In general, the amount of deposited metal
is controlled by the treatment time. In this work, the content of
Ni in the composite samples is the same as the amount of Ni(OOCCH3)2·4H2O (Ni sources) in the electroless
deposition bath. That is, we added the Ni source by the required amount.
After the addition of the reducing agent, the treatment time was set
to 60 min so as to completely deposit. The actual contents of Ni determined
by WDS analysis are 8, 14, 25, and 32 wt %. Figure 1 compares the Raman spectra and XRD patterns
collected from the synthesized active materials with Ni amounts ranging
from 0 to 30 wt %. The intensities of black phosphorus Raman bands
are reduced with increasing Ni amounts. In other words, the coating
layer formed on the phosphorus likely grew thicker while maintaining
the core structure. No peaks were observed in the XRD patterns, with
the exception of phosphorus up to a Ni coating of 10 wt %, which suggests
that amorphous Ni was deposited onto the phosphorus surface. Meanwhile,
with coatings of 20 wt % or more, peaks assigned to NiP3, NiP2, and Ni12P5 appeared, and
the peak intensities for the compounds became strong with increasing
Ni contents. The Ni–P atomic ratio of NiP3, NiP2, and Ni12P5 are 0.33, 0.5, and 2.4,
respectively. In view of these results, we inferred that Ni diffuses
through the surface inside of phosphorus to form Ni–P compounds
in the order of Ni12P5, NiP2, and
NiP3 from the surface toward the center. That is, a Ni-rich
phase should be present at the outermost surface. The chemical species
near the particle surface was analyzed using XPS with a monochromatic
Al Kα X-ray source. Figure 2 shows the P 2p and Ni 2p core level spectra obtained
from the Ni-coated phosphorus composite. The P 2p spectra consist
of three main components and an additional shoulder. Clear peaks are
confirmed at 129.2 and 129.9 eV regardless of the electroless deposition
treatment, and the peaks correspond to elemental phosphorus (P0). The Ni–P layer, as a shell, likely became thicker
because the signal intensity of phosphorus gradually diminished with
increasing Ni content. The peak centered at 134.4 eV in the spectra
of pristine phosphorus comes from a pentoxide such as P4O10 (P5+). Phosphorus has various valencies
in its intermediate oxides;43 signals from
131 to 136 eV indicate the existence of phosphorus oxides, and the
valence (x) can change from P3+ to Px+ (x < 5).43,44 The binding energy of 133.8 eV is attributed to the O–P=O
bond with an oxidation state of P4+ (i.e., P4O8). The weak peak observed at the lower binding energy
is due to the P–O–P bond (P3+) of P4O6.43,44 The shoulder at around 130 eV45,46 that appears for 20 and 30 wt % Ni-coated samples indicates the
presence of Ni12P5, which is expected to be
a component positioned at the surface of the Ni–P shell layer.
The signature of Ni12P5 is shown not only in
the P 2p spectra but also in the Ni 2p spectra. We can clearly confirm
a peak at 853 eV associated with metallic Ni (Ni0), although
no diffraction pattern derived from it was detected, which means that
the deposited Ni on the phosphorus surface is in an amorphous state
and has a thickness of several angstroms to several nanometers. Also
in the 5 and 10 wt % Ni-coated composites, a slight signal associated
with metallic Ni was observed. The appearance of a Ni-rich phase,
such as Ni12P5 and metallic Ni, supports the
above inference. However, the strong peak at 856.5 eV only appears
with satellite peaks located at approximately 862 eV, with the electroless
deposition of Ni. The signals originate from the Ni2+ species,
such as NiO and Ni–P compounds,45,46 and NiO was
probably formed owing to the reduction of P4O10 by the deposited metallic Ni. The decreasing oxygen concentration
of phosphorus oxide as the amount of Ni coating increases also provides
evidence for this. Given the results obtained from the XRD and XPS
studies, the shell layers surrounding the core phosphorus are considered
to be composed of amorphous Ni with some oxide, as far as Ni content
is 10 wt %; however, the shell is composed of Ni12P5, NiP2, and NiP3 layers from the surface
toward the center for coatings of 20 wt % or more. The results of
the XPS depth profile of P 2p and Ni 2p regions obtained after different
Ar-ion sputtering times strongly support the core–shell structure
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). Part
of the metallic Ni remained, which as it is and partially resulted
in NiO by the reduction of phosphorus oxide at the outermost surface.

spectra and (b) XRD patterns of Ni-coated phosphorus
powder synthesized by the electroless deposition method. In the Raman
spectroscopic measurements, the composite sample was placed into a
quartz cell, and the spectra were collected at room temperature.

for various Ni-coated
phosphorus composites. The incident X-ray source is monochromatic
radiation (Al Kα, 1486.6 eV) and was operated at 25 W (X-ray
beam diameter: 100 mm, source analyzer angle: 45.0°).

Figure 3 displays
the FE-SEM images and the corresponding EDS mapping results of the
composite particles with Ni amounts of 5 and 30 wt %. The EDS mapping
image of Ni Kα overlaps with that of P Kα, and the intensity
of the X-ray fluorescence is homogeneously distributed; thus, α-Ni
and Ni/Ni–P layers uniformly cover the phosphorus. At 10 and
20 wt % Ni deposition, uniform coatings are also successfully accomplished
by electroless deposition, including sensitization and activation
treatments (Figure S5, Supporting Information). STEM observations were conducted to examine the crystallinity
and thickness of the shell layers in detail. Clear lattice fringes
(with a d-spacing of 3.36 Å) which are attributed
to the (021) lattice plane of black phosphorus with an orthorhombic
system (space group: Cmca/ICSD no. 01-073-1358) are
confirmed in the highly magnified image for the 5 wt % Ni-coated sample
(Figure 4a). The STEM
and TEM analyses of the amorphous samples show a bright-field image
that generally darkens when the product thickness and density increase.
No lattice fringes are identified in the STEM images of 5 wt % Ni-coated
phosphorus, which shows that the layer is still amorphous and is in
good agreement with the XRD results. Considering these results, the
shell layer is shown in the white parts, and the thickness is about
2 nm. By contrast, the thickness appears to be at least 60 nm for
the 30 wt % Ni-coated sample; however, it is difficult to distinguish
the contrasting density (Figure 4b). A focused ion beam (FIB) was applied to fabricate
the cross-sectional surface of the composite particles. The particles
were buried under a colloidal graphite powder in advance to protect
against damage induced by the Ga ion of the FIB. Figure 4c shows a cross-sectional backscattered
electron image of the 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus particle. The brightness
of the image depends on the average atomic number and is useful to
obtain compositional information. We can confirm that the shell layer
has a coating thickness of 100–200 nm, as indicated by the
bright region. Thus, from the STEM and FIB-SEM analyses (Figure S6, Supporting Information), the thickness of the
Ni/Ni–P layer with the mixed phase is consequently revealed
to include α-Ni, Ni12P5, NiP2, and NiP3, which is at least 40 nm but less than 200
nm. The shells are expected to act as an electron conduction channel
to bring out the inherently high theoretical capacity of phosphorus.

In treatments, so as to make Ni amounts of 5 and 30 wt %, the actual
weight ratio of Ni determined by WDS measurements were 8 and 32 wt
%, respectively.

structure of the composite particle prepared by electroless deposition

The electrochemical behaviors
of the Ni-coated phosphorus composites
as a negative electrode for Na-ion batteries are presented in Figure 5a. The specific capacity
was calculated on the basis of the weight of an entire active material,
including a shell layer. For the 5 wt % Ni coating, the electrode
showed an initial discharge capacity of 1760 mA h g–1 with a Coulombic efficiency of 74%. The initial efficiency is equal
to that of the black phosphorus electrode, and the overvoltage at
0.63–0.42 V observed only in the black phosphorus electrode
was suppressed, which indicates that the α-Ni shell layer functions
as an electron conduction channel but not as an inactivator of Na-insertion
into phosphorus. We can distinguish four main electrochemical reactions
in the differential capacity versus voltage (dQ/dV) curves for all electrodes (Figure 5b). In each electrode, the broad peak that
appears between 0.25 and 0.70 V is due to the formation of a surface
layer caused by the reduction of an electrolyte and FEC additive and
is thereby responsible for the irreversible capacity.16,17 A peak observed at 0.65 V is probably associated with the primary
sodiation involved in the intercalation of the Na ion into interlayers
consisting of phosphorene.24 Han et al.
studied the atomistic sodiation mechanism of black phosphorus using
the first-principles calculation.22 They
found that the P–P bond in phosphorus does not break at Na
concentrations below Na0.25P, in which only the intercalation
reaction occurs. The formation of Na0.25P delivers a capacity
of ∼220 mA h g–1, and that derived at approximately
0.65 V is comparable. Sharp peaks at 0.41 and 0.20 V and voltage plateaus
shown in the regions between 0.42–0.22 and 0.22–0.18
V are considered to be due to the formation of Na2P and
Na3P, respectively.16,17 For the 30 wt % Ni-coated
phosphorus, the electrode exhibited a discharge capacity of 1230 mA
h g–1, which is more than quadruple the reversible
capacity obtained from carbon-based electrodes,27−30 whereas the peak in the dQ/dV profile slightly shifted to the low
voltage side. This is because Na-inactive Ni was precipitated on the
phosphorus surface even though it is amorphous and relatively thin.
There is no remarkable difference on the discharge (Na-extraction)
side (Figure S7, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 (a) Initial charge–discharge (Na-insertion/extraction) profiles
of Ni-coated phosphorus electrodes at a rate of 260 mA g–1 (0.1 C) in the voltage range of 0.005–1.500 V (vs Na/Na+). (b) Differential charge capacity vs voltage (dQ/dV) curve of the composite electrode consisting
of the as-prepared black phosphorus and 5 and 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus.

Figure 6 shows the
ex situ XRD patterns of 5 and 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus electrodes
in the fully sodiated state of 0.005 V and desodiated at 1.5 V under
the galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) condition.
At the cutoff voltage of 0.005 V, obvious XRD peaks were observed,
which can be attributed to Na3P with a hexagonal structure
(P63/mmc (194)/ICSD:
01-073-3917). On the other hand, the peak derived from black phosphorus
disappeared at 1.5 V during the discharge state. Sodiation beyond
a Na concentration of Na0.28P with a large volume change
leads to P–P bond cleavage.22 Silicon
(Si) as the negative electrode for LIBs can absorb 3.75 Li by itself
to show a high theoretical capacity of 3580 mA h g–1; however, in this case, Si is forced to undergo amorphization by
breaking Si–Si bonds induced by the alloying reactions with
Li.47,48 For the phosphorus-based electrodes, the
same explanation as for the Si electrode would apply, which is responsible
for the disappearance of the black phosphorus peak. In addition to
phosphorus, the Ni–P alloy detected before the charge also
disappeared at the desodiated state of 1.5 V. Possible reasons are
as follows: (i) formation of nanostructured elemental Ni and P by
its phase separation39 and (ii) crystallinity
deterioration or amorphous transformation.25 However, as much as 30 wt % Ni is contained within the active material.
Ni should be detected as a single body if the phase separation progresses
because as much as 30 wt % Ni is incorporated. We therefore consider
that the Ni–P alloy undergoes amorphization rather than the
phase separation during the sodiation reaction. Even if it is separated,
it is expected to be a composite material in which the conductive
fine particles are dispersed within the active material. Elucidating
the crystallinity and involvement of the shell layer in electrochemical
reactions will be studied in the future. Nonetheless, the phase transformation
from phosphorus to trisodium phosphide (Na3P) via three-electron
reaction was demonstrated.

Figure 6 (a) GITT curves of Ni-coated phosphorus electrodes
during the first
cycle. The electrodes were charged or discharged at a constant current
density of 260 mA g–1 (C/10) for 1 h, and the relaxation
process at the open circuit was monitored for 2 h. The process was
repeated up to the cutoff voltage. (b) Ex situ XRD patterns of the
Ni-coated phosphorus electrodes during the charge–discharge
(reduction/oxidation) reactions during the first cycle.

Cycling tests were conducted to reveal the influence
of the shell
layer on the electrode performance for phosphorus-based electrodes
(Figure 7). The as-prepared
phosphorus resulted in a poor electrode performance. Although a discharge
capacity of 1770 mA h g–1 was achieved at the first
cycle, the capacity gradually decreased and then rapid-fading suddenly
occurred at the 20th cycle, which indicates the electrical isolation
of the active material from the current collector. The temporary decline
of the Coulombic efficiency around the 23rd cycle is due to the reconstruction
of a surface layer through the reductive decomposition of the electrolyte
in spite of the use of an FEC additive. A volume expansion/contraction
close to 400% occurs in the electrochemical reactions between phosphorus
and trisodium phosphide (Na3P)16 and thereby pulverizes the active material, followed by the breakup
of the surface layer. These are the main reasons for the unfavorable
events. It is noteworthy that the capacity fading was effectively
suppressed with an increase in the Ni concentration of the shell layer.
Although the initial capacity appears to be small as the layer becomes
thicker, there is no noticeable difference between the layers based
on the capacity per phosphorus, excluding Ni. The 5 wt % Ni-coated
composite achieved a higher initial discharge capacity per phosphorus
than that of the as-prepared phosphorus, indicating that smooth electron
transport occurs inside the active material layer. After the 60th
cycle, however, only a capacity of 170 mA h g(P)–1 remained. By contrast, the 30 wt % Ni-coated composite achieved
the best electrode performance; a capacity of 780 mA h g(P)–1 was maintained even after the 60th cycle (Figures S8 and S9, Supporting Information). On the other hand, when
the capacities are calculated over the entire electrode (30 wt % Ni-coated
phosphorus), including conductive additive, binder, and Ni, the discharge
capacities at the first and the 60th cycles are 620 and 300 mA h g–1, respectively. Although the relatively good capacity
retention was obtained by coating Ni with 30 wt %, the large Ni loading
is one of the reasons for the decrease in the effective capacity in
batteries. While imparting conductivity with less Ni amount, the achievement
of high cycling performance by improvement using other components
such as binders and electrolytes is a future study.

capacity (open circles), discharge capacity
(closed circle), and Coulombic efficiency vs cycle number for the
Ni-coated phosphorus electrodes in 1 M NaPF6/EC–DEC
(50:50 vol %) with 5 vol % FEC at a rate of 260 mA g–1 (0.1 C). The reversible capacity was calculated based on the weight
of the active material including Ni.

We investigated the reaction resistances of the elemental
steps
during the electrochemical sodiation by EIS measurements using an
[electrode|electrolyte|electrode] symmetric cell with two identical
negative electrodes charged (Na-inserted) at 0.005 V. The impedance
spectra monitored at the first and 30th cycles are depicted in Figure 8. Under these conditions,
the Nyquist plots are understandably composed of only the resistances
that originate from the negative electrodes because Na metal as the
counter electrode was not used,40 which
enables us to discuss the influence of the Ni content in the layer
on the electrochemical Na-insertion reactions. In the first cycle,
the Nyquist plots show two obvious semicircles and a straight line
with a slope of approximately 45°. The first semicircle observed
in the high-frequency region denotes interfacial Na-ion conduction
through an FEC-derived surface layer (interfacial resistance: Rif). The FEC additive electrochemically decomposes
before the EC and DEC solvents to form a protective layer that suppresses
further electrolyte decomposition.2 Each
size of semicircles corresponding to resistance values is same degree
(∼5 Ω), which supports the effect of FEC addition. The
second semicircle in the middle frequency region is interpreted as
the charge transfer resistance (Rct) involved
in the sodiation reaction.19 The as-prepared
black phosphorus caused a large charge transfer resistance (25 Ω),
which is responsible for the original low electrical conductivity.
On the other hand, the resistance values for the 5 and 30 wt % Ni-coated
composites became less than half of that for the as-prepared black
phosphorus. For the 5 wt % Ni coating, the thickness of the shell
layer surrounding the phosphorus is only about 2 nm, whereas the 30
wt % Ni-coated composite has approximately a 200 nm thick layer with
Ni inside the core structure in the form of a solid solution. The
developed electrical conduction network probably allows for a smooth
charge transfer. This is the reason why the Ni-coated composite exhibited
a much smaller reaction resistance. After the 30th cycle, no increase
in the charge resistance was recognized in the 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus
(Figure S10, Supporting Information), suggesting
the high structural stability of the shell layer as the electrical
conduction channel. The favorable effect is reflected in the changes
in the electrode thickness after the 30th desodiation, as shown in
the cross-sectional FE-SEM images (Figure 9); the electrode is dense compared to the
other electrodes, although the electrode thickness before cycling
is at the same level. In the black phosphorus electrode, cracks and
great porosities were locally generated. The cause of the significant
deformation is the inhomogeneous electrochemical reactions. Reversibility
of desodiation reactions for the respective active materials is revealed
from the surface FE-SEM images of the cycled phosphorus-based electrodes;
in the black phosphorus electrode, phosphorus remained expanded after
cycling, which indicates that desodiation from nonconductive Na3P formed during the charge reactions did not proceed completely.
By contrast, for the Ni-coated composite, irreversible electrochemical
reactions were effectively suppressed with an increase in the Ni content
(Figure S11, Supporting Information). In
the FE-SEM observation and EDS mapping analysis for 30 wt % Ni-coated
phosphorus powder peeled off from the electrodes after the first cycle,
we can confirm that the mapping image of Ni Kα overlaps with
that of P Kα, which indicates the structural integrity of the
coating layer on the phosphorus particle. Even after the 10th cycle,
Ni element was detected, although the intensity of the X-ray fluorescence
was slightly decreased (Figure S12, Supporting Information). The obtained results make it clear that the Ni-based
coating layer was held on the phosphorus particle even after charge–discharge
processes were involved in volume changes, and that the core–shell
structure has high durability. As for the black phosphorus electrode,
the active material layer is detached from the current collector,
which leads to rapid capacity fading (Figure S13, Supporting Information). Porosities were still confirmed in
the 5 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus electrode; however, the degree of
porosity is decreased compared with that of black phosphorus. Furthermore,
such a change in the electrode structure was suppressed in the 30
wt % Ni-coated composite. It was demonstrated that the Ni/Ni–P
shell layer with a conducting pathway also acts as a buffer against
the stress induced by the large volumetric change in phosphorus during
the sodiation and desodiation reactions.

Figure 8 Impedance spectra of
[electrode|electrolyte|electrode] symmetric
cells at 25 °C. Before the analysis, two identical electrodes
were cycled and charged up to 0.005 V. The Randles circuit used in
the present study for the analysis of cell impedance is shown in the
inset. The black, blue, and red symbols are the as-prepared black
phosphorus and 5 and 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus, respectively.

Figure 9 Cross-sectional FE-SEM images of phosphorus-based
electrodes before
(top) and after (bottom) the 30th desodiation.

Finally, the rapid discharge property was evaluated at various
current densities (Figure 10). With respect to the black phosphorus electrode, the capacities
were substantially decreased with increasing current density, and
only a capacity of 370 mA g–1 remained at 5.0 C.
By contrast, the composite electrode showed improved rate capabilities.
In particular, 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus exhibited a remarkably
high performance; a capacity of 940 mA g–1 with
a capacity retention of 80% was attained even at a high rate of 5.0
C. Considering the capacity per phosphorus (1340 mA g(P)–1), the value corresponds to 52% of the theoretical capacity of black
phosphorus. What these examples make clear is that the conductive
network granted by the Ni/Ni–P shell layer enables a good electron
transfer inside the electrode to bring out an inherently high theoretical
capacity of phosphorus. Therefore, the effectiveness of the conductivity
was improved at a single particle level. The type of coated metal
and the dependence of the phase transition on the treatment temperature
will be studied in the future.

Figure 10 (a) Rate capability of the composite
electrodes. The electrodes
were charged at a constant rate of 0.1 C (1 C = 2600 mA g–1) and then were discharged under various current densities (0.1,
0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 5.0 C). (b) Capacity retention of the discharge
capacities.

Conclusions
For
achieving high energy density Na-ion batteries, Ni-coated phosphorus
was prepared by an electroless deposition technique using milled black
phosphorus. The XRD results revealed that Ni was deposited as an amorphous
layer on the surface with 10 wt % Ni content. Coating with 20 wt %
Ni or more produced a shell with a thickness of ∼200 nm in
the order of Ni12P5, NiP2, and NiP3 from the surface toward the center. In addition, metallic
Ni formed at the outermost surface. The 30 wt % Ni-coated phosphorus
composite exhibited a superior cycling performance to that of the
other electrodes; a reversible capacity of 780 mA h g(P)–1 corresponding to twice or more of that of the hard carbon electrodes
was maintained, even after the 60th cycle. The EIS analysis and cross-sectional
FE-SEM observation demonstrated that the Ni/Ni–P shell played
a key role in buffering the large volumetric change in phosphorus
during sodiation/desodiation rather than in the enhancement of utilization
of active materials. As a matter of course, one of the factors is
that the good conducting pathway granted by the shell layer also activates
the reversible Na storage reaction of nonconductive Na3P. Furthermore, the layer on phosphorus allowed the smooth charge
transfer to upgrade the rapid charge–discharge property; a
desodiation capacity of 1340 mA g(P)–1 was achieved
even at a high rate of 5.0 C. Metal coating by electroless deposition
at a single particle level should be a powerful yet simple process
to improve the reversibility of the electrochemical reactions and
the cycling performance of phosphorus-based electrodes.
