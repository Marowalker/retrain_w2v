Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) are well-established model systems for studying membrane structure and
dynamics. Electroformation, also referred to as electroswelling, is
one of the most prevalent methods for producing GUVs, as it enables
modulation of the lipid hydration process to form relatively monodisperse,
defect-free vesicles. Currently, however, it is expensive and time-consuming
compared with other methods. In this study, we demonstrate that 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine GUVs can be prepared readily
at a fraction of the cost on stainless steel electrodes, such as commercially
available syringe needles, without any evidence of lipid oxidation
or hydrolysis.

Introduction
Giant unilamellar vesicles
(GUVs), often referred to as giant liposomes,
are fluid-filled membranes that offer a useful basic model of a biological
cell. GUVs have been widely used as models to study the fluid–fluid
and gel–fluid phase coexistence of membrane lipids,1−6 membrane transport phenomena,7−12 the behavior of native membranes,13−16 the structure of early cells
and protocells,17 and more recently, cells’
biological activity.10 In its simplest
form, a GUV consists of a single amphiphilic lipid bilayer that encloses
an aqueous solution.

Among the multitude of production methods
developed over several
decades,18−20 lipid-film hydration,21 electroformation,22 lipid emulsification,23,24 and microfluidic-based methods, such as fluid jetting25 and hydrodynamic flow focusing,26 are the most widely used. While the literature on vesicle
formation is rich with established formation protocols, each technique
has its own inherent drawbacks and trade-offs according to the application.
The factors affecting the choice of a specific protocol are technical
expertise, the need for specialist equipment, and the degree to which
vesicle characteristics need to be tuned. Of the methods mentioned
above, electroformation is one of the most widespread.18

Figure 1 Schematic of vesicle electroformation from a dry lipid bilayer
deposited on a substrate. Vesicles are formed upon hydration and the
application of an alternating electric field, Ẽ (not to scale).

Electroformation of GUVs
was pioneered by Angelova and Dimitrov
in 1986.22 It involves modulating the spontaneous
swelling of lipids within an aqueous solution using an externally
applied electric field (Figure 1). Typically, a solution of lipids dissolved in an
organic solvent is deposited on two electrodes of indium tin oxide
(ITO)-coated glass or platinum. Following solvent evaporation, the
electrodes are placed in contact with an aqueous solution. Subsequently,
an alternating potential difference is applied across the electrodes,
stimulating the swelling process of the hydrated lipid layer. The
main advantages of electroformation are that it requires comparatively
little technical expertise to implement and that it yields spherical,
relatively monodisperse and unilamellar lipid vesicles. Set against
this, however, is the cost of the electrodes, which limits the scalability
of the technique.

In this article, we present and validate a
simple electrode modification
in the standard electroformation protocol that reduces the cost and
time of chamber preparation while improving scalability. 1,2-Dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) was chosen as a
representative unsaturated phospholipid, which is more prone to oxidation
than saturated phospholipids, such as 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DSPC), 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC), and 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), to prove that stainless steel does
not affect its structural integrity.

Stainless steel electrodes,
such as injection needles, provide
a significantly lower-cost alternative to platinum and ITO electrodes,
which are the established electrode materials reported in the electroformation
literature. Other studies have also reported electroformation of vesicles
on interdigitated and nonconductive substrates,27 albeit with limited adoption rates.

Stainless steel
electrodes provide numerous advantages. First,
the rigidity of stainless steel compared to that of platinum reduces
the risk of bending, improving control over the electrode-separation
distance, thus leading to a more uniform electric field. In addition,
disposable needles do not require cleaning in an ultrasound bath,28 are readily available, and do not require the
modification of current chambers.

The wide cost disparity between
stainless steel and platinum enables
two secondary modifications to the electroformation protocol: the
use of longer electrodes and chamber parallelization.29 These lead, in turn, to an increase in the overall vesicle
production, concurrent electroformation, and multiparametric testing
at high throughput.

While a direct comparison between electroformation
methods is complex, Table 1 provides an overview
of the merits and drawbacks of different electrode materials used
in the electroformation of vesicles. To populate the table, the electrode
surface area was fixed across all methods. The cost comparison was
carried out on the face value of the electrodes, without taking into
account the cost of the purpose-built polyoxymethylene electroformation
chamber. A full cost breakdown of the electroformation chamber is
provided in Table S1. It is noteworthy
that, if the stainless steel electrodes were disposed of after every
electroformation experiment, it would take approximately 292 experiments
to match the cost of the platinum electrodes—ignoring overheads,
such as the time and cost of cleaning.

for five pairs of 40
mm cylindrical electrodes with a diameter of 0.8 mm or an ITO surface
of equivalent area (10 cm2).

In the experiments reported here, these features are
exploited
using a purpose-built electroformation device, which consists of a
polyoxymethylene base containing five electroformation chambers and
a lid to hold the electrodes in position.

To validate the proposed
technique, vesicles were characterized
in terms of their size distribution, lipid packing and unilamellarity
of their membranes. In addition, the constituents of the aqueous electroformation
solution were analyzed using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
spectroscopy (ICP-OES) to test whether any ions are released from
the electrodes during electroformation. Lipid degradation was assessed
by NMR.

Results and Discussion
GUV Production and Imaging
Electroformation
visualization
chambers have been used to monitor and verify the effective production
of vesicles.30 To assess the formation
of vesicles on stainless steel electrodes, swelling was visualized
in situ (Figure 2a)
using a second specially designed electroformation chamber with optical
access using the protocol described in the Materials
and Methods section.
Vesicle formation was observed across most of the electrode surface,
even before the application of the electric field (Figure 2a). Upon switching on the signal
generator, the swelling was accelerated, and the vesicles reached
a moderate size (see video in the Supporting
Information). Swelling and detachment of DOPC vesicles from an electrode
were also observed (Figure 2b,c).

Figure 2 Vesicles swelling from electroformation electrodes: (a)
hydrated
lipid layer commencing the swelling process, (b) DiI-labeled single-vesicle
swelling while attached to the electroformation electrodes, and (c)
vesicles forming, swelling, and detaching along the electrode.

Following the visualization, vesicles were produced inside the device depicted in Figure 2a using the electroformation protocol described in the Materials and Methods section. The electrode material did
not produce significant differences in the size distributions of the
vesicles (Figure 3)
which were within the ranges reported in the literature (10–30
μm for DOPC vesicles).27,31,32

Figure 3 (a)
Size distribution of DOPC vesicles as a function of electrode
material. The white bars represent vesicles formed using platinum
wires as electrodes, whereas the gray bars represent vesicles formed
using stainless steel electrodes. (b) Comparison of average vesicle
diameters (±standard deviation) of platinum and stainless steel
electrodes. Three independent experiments were conducted, and over
1500 vesicles were analyzed for each electrode material.

The yield of a single electroformation chamber
was estimated by
suspending 100 μL of a GUV-rich solution in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) and counting the number of vesicles at the bottom of
a visualization plate after sedimentation. The vesicles were counted
using a purpose-built algorithm for both electrode materials. On average,
electroformation of the stainless steel electrode yielded 2256 vesicles
(22 560 vesicles/mL) against the 3114 (31 140 vesicles/mL)
yielded by the platinum wire electrodes. The difference, however,
was not statistically significant.

It should be noted, however,
that a comparison between GUV studies
is problematic because of the differences in experimental parameters,
such as osmotic pressure, electrode size and separation, electroformation
solution, lipid species, electric field strength, imaging plane, and
vesicle manipulation technique.

Lipid Order and Size of
Vesicles Composed of Binary Lipid Mixtures
To test the parallelization
potential, vesicles with different
compositions were produced simultaneously by varying the DOPC/cholesterol
(DOPC/Chol) molar ratio in the multichamber device (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Simultaneous electroformation
of vesicles with dissimilar membrane
properties. (a) Generalized polarization (GP) of the vesicles as a
function of initial lipid-film formulation. (b) Representative GP
false-colored images of four vesicles with different GP values.

The results depicted in Figure 5 were obtained by
performing four concurrent electroformation
experiments, coating the wires in each chamber with a different lipid
composition. Figure 5a displays the average GPs and the standard deviations of the vesicles
for each initial lipid composition. The packing of the membrane increases
with increasing cholesterol volume fraction, as cholesterol intercalates
between the DOPC lipids.33−35 The electroformation cycle lasted
2.5 h, required limited setup time, and was performed using four pairs
of new injection needles (SS304), at a total electrode cost of approximately
£2.00. The equivalent cost of Pt wire electrodes would have been
approximately £584 and would have required electrode cleaning
and straightening.

Figure 5 (a) Vesicle diameters as a function of lipid composition
(b) Lipid
packing of DOPC vesicles as a function of electrode material.

The consistency in vesicle diameter
was determined as a function
of lipid composition. The vesicle size was not affected significantly
by the molar fraction of cholesterol compared with the 1:0 DOPC/Chol
composition (Figure 6a). The electrode material did not have an effect on the lipid packing
of GUV electrodes (Figure 6b). A higher osmolarity of the extravesicular environment
yields vesicles with a higher membrane order and thus a higher degree
of lipid packing.36

GUVs (top trace) and large multilamellar vesicles (LMVs) (bottom trace).
The residual solvent peaks of chloroform (7.26 ppm) and methanol (3.49
ppm) were removed for clarity. The inset shows a magnified view of
the olefinic and head group protons.

Leaching of Metals from the Electrodes
Leaching of
transition metals from the electrodes can be a concern in the electroformation
of GUVs. Metal ions can bind to membranes37 and alter their bilayer structure,38 phase
behavior,39 and stability against vesicle
fusion.40 Unwanted chemical reactions can
also be catalyzed by trace metals: chromium, iron, and nickel can
initiate and, in some cases, propagate lipid peroxidation.41

The possibility of leaching of metals
from stainless steel electrodes under electroformation conditions
was assessed by comparing the concentrations of their constituents
(Fe, Cr, Ni, and Mn) in GUV samples (Table 2) prepared using stainless steel and platinum
electrodes. No increase in metal concentration compared to that of
platinum electrodes was detected by ICP-OES. While no evidence of
ion leaching was detected when the electroformation was carried out
in 200 mM sucrose, this may not be the case in conductive electroformation
solutions. On the contrary, platinum electrodes are routinely used
to electroform vesicles in solutions of physiological ionic strength.
A similar argument holds true for temperature, as the electroformation
of vesicles with higher transition temperatures requires a heated
chamber.

and stainless steel electrodes are shown.

Lipid Oxidation and Hydrolysis
The products of lipid
oxidation and hydrolysis, which can be generated at the electrode
during the electroformation process,42 are
also known to affect the physical properties of phospholipid membranes.
Even small amounts of the degradation products can cause structural
and dynamic changes, such as the formation of lipid rafts42 or changes in permeability43 and mechanical stability.441H NMR and 31P NMR spectroscopies are among the
fastest and most informative analytical methods that have been used
to characterize the chemical structure of phospholipids extracted
from biological membranes and their degradation products.45−48 The structural integrity of electroformed GUVs was assessed by comparing
the NMR spectra of the combined lipid extracts from nine electroformed
GUV samples with a control obtained from LMVs prepared by lipid hydration.
The 1H NMR spectra of lipids extracted from electroformed
GUVs and LMVs are compared in Figure 6. The spectra were identical and consistent with pure
DOPC. No degradation products were detected within a limit of detection
of 1 mol %. Although trace impurities can be seen in the electroformed
sample, the same impurities are found in the control. Their concentration
remains constant when the concentration of DOPC in the control sample
is increased from 0.34 to 3.4 mM, suggesting that they could be due
to trace contamination rather than lipid degradation.

The absence
of hydrolysis products was confirmed by the 31P NMR spectrum,
which shows only one signal in both samples. All isomers of lyso-PC
would resonate downfield, where no signal was detected.

Unilamellarity
of Electroformed Vesicles
Vesicle unilamellarity
was tested using a fluorescence quenching assay on the basis of the
measurement of the ratio of inner to outer layers of fluorescently
labeled GUVs.49,50 DOPC vesicles symmetrically labeled
with the fluorescent lipid, N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)-1,2-dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, triethylammonium salt
(NBD-PE), were electroformed, and a time course of their fluorescence
was measured in a plate reader. Sodium dithionite, a membrane-impermeable
quencher, was added to the sample to quench the fluorophores on the
outer layer of the vesicles. The vesicles were then lysed by addition
of Triton X-100, to expose all lipids to the quencher. The ratio of
the emission drop caused by the addition of detergent (Iinterior) to the total emission drop (Itotal = Iinterior + Iexterior) is used as a measure of the fraction
of leaflets that are not exposed to the solvent (unilamellarity index)
(Figure 7). We measured
a ratio of 51 ± 2.8%, which is consistent with unilamellarity.
The measurements for all three samples are provided in the Supporting Information.

Figure 7 Fluorescence intensity
measurements of DOPC/NBD-PE vesicles. The
fluorescence of intact vesicles is represented from time = 0 to arrow
1. At arrow 1, the quencher is added to the suspension, and the intensity
is recorded until a stable value is reached. The emission drop is
a measure of the number of fluorophores in outer leaflets. At arrow
2, Triton X-100 is added to lyse the vesicles, and fluorescence is
recorded until a new stable value is reached. The corresponding emission
drop is a measure of the number of fluorophores in inner leaflets.
After each addition, the plate was removed from the plate reader and
shaken for several minutes (the time axis is correspondingly cut for
clarity).

Conclusions
In
summary, in this article, giant vesicle electroformation using
an alternative electrode material was proposed and validated. We demonstrate
that electroswelling of unilamellar vesicles occurs efficiently on
stainless steel electrodes without any significant difference in vesicle
size distribution, lipid degradation, or leaching of metals in the
electroformation chamber from those of platinum electrodes. By using
readily available stainless steel electrodes, we show that rapid,
low-cost, and scalable electroformation can be achieved. We believe
this platform will find application in biophysical investigations
of the membrane, particularly in studies where multiplexing is crucial,
such as large-scale screening of bioactive compounds.

Materials and
Methods
Electroformation Chamber
The electroformation chamber
(Figure 8a) is composed
of two parts: the electroformation base and the chamber lid. The electroformation
base (150 mm × 40 mm × 50 mm) was designed to accommodate
five equidistant electroformation chambers with a length of 50 mm
and a diameter of 10 mm. The extremities of the chambers were tapered
to increase vesicle concentration and facilitate the collection of
the produced GUVs. The electroformation lid (150 mm × 40 mm ×
5 mm) consists of five pairs of through holes (⌀ 1 mm), each
aligned with an electroformation chamber, that are used to host the
electrodes. On the side of the lid, 3 mm brass screws were positioned
in correspondence to each electroformation chamber, to hold the electrodes
in place once fully screwed. A copper bar (165 mm × 10 mm) ensures
an electrical connection between corresponding electrodes. The chamber
base and the lid were held together with four 4 mm screws at each
corner of the device. The cost of the electroformation device with
five electroformation chambers was calculated to be ∼£14.00.
The full cost breakdown is provided in the Supporting Information.

and
formation visualization. (a) Scalable device with five electroformation
chambers and needles held by brass screws. (b) Monitoring device with
six chambers, brass screws, and stainless steel sheets for electrical
connection between common electrodes.

A similar device (Figure 8b) was designed with the aim of visualizing the vesicle
electroswelling
process. The device was designed to be dimensionally compatible with
a microscope stage and the working distance of a 40× objective.
In this device, the electroformation electrodes were placed horizontally
to allow imaging of the entire electrode surface area. A 170 μm
thick
glass slide was coupled with the bottom of the chamber with silicone
gel. The electrodes were connected using two sheets of stainless steel,
to provide a common electrical connection.

The electroformation
chamber was cut from a solid piece of polyoxymethylene
purchased from RS Components, U.K., brass screws were also supplied
by RS Components, and 0.8 mm 21G 50 mm needles were purchased from
Becton, Dickinson and Company. DOPC was sourced from Avanti Polar
Lipids, Inc.. Cholesterol, sucrose, 2-[4-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
NBD-PE was purchased from ThermoFisher, U.K. All reagents were used
as received without further purification. The electrodes were connected
to an Agilent 33220A signal generator set to high-impedance load.
GUVs were imaged in a μ-Slide eight-well multiwell plate purchased
from ibidi GmbH, Germany. Ultrapure water (MilliQ) from a Millipore
filtration system (resistivity, >18.2 MΩ cm) was used throughout
all experiments.

Electroformation Protocol
The electroformation
protocol
consisted in preparing solutions of DOPC (1 mg/mL in chloroform) and
cholesterol (10 mg/mL in chloroform) at varying molar ratios (1:0–1:3).
The electrodes were rinsed in toluene and wiped using Kimwipes (Kimberly-Clark
Professional) to remove any traces of silicon lubricant. The desired
solution was then pipetted vertically onto the electrodes (50 μL
per electrode pair) using a glass syringe, carefully coating the entire
surface. After a drying phase of approximately 1 h, the electroformation
chamber was filled with a sucrose solution (∼3 mL, 200 mM sucrose
in deionized (DI) water at room temperature), the electrodes were
submerged, and the signal generator was connected via the brass screws
on the sides of the chamber.

A 5 Vpp, 10 Hz sinusoidal excitation
was applied for 2 h to induce repetitive stress on the hydrated lipid
bilayer, leading to vesicle swelling. The effective voltage on the
electroformation chamber was recorded using a high-voltage probe and
oscilloscope as 4.87 Vpp, indicating a 0.13 V voltage difference due
to an unmatched load of the signal generator. Subsequently, the frequency
of the excitation was lowered to 5 Hz for 30 min to facilitate vesicle
detachment. The electroformation parameters used in the protocol are
summarized in Table 3. At the end of the electroformation process, the lid of the chamber
was removed and the vesicles were slowly pipetted into a visualization
well using a 100–1000 μL pipette tip. To minimize the
shear stress at the orifice, the end of the pipette tip was cut by
2 mm using a pair of scissors. The same protocol was used for both
SS304 and platinum electrodes.

GUV Detection and Sizing
The GUVs were imaged by phase-contrast
microscopy using a Nikon ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope (Nikon Corporation,
Japan), and the images were then processed using a purpose-built MATLAB
routine. The algorithm detects the GUVs on the basis of the imfindcircles
built-in MATLAB function, calculates their diameter, and plots a vesicle-size
histogram for all of the vesicles detected.

To quantify the
concentration of DOPC GUVs, a finite volume (100 μL) of the
electroformation solution was placed in an 8-well imaging dish (ibidi,
U.K.) with 400 μL of PBS. The dish was coated with BSA by letting
a 1 mg/mL BSA solution in DI water stand for 2 h. The BSA solution
was then rinsed gently with DI water. After allowing the GUVs to sediment
for an additional 2 h, the glass surface of the dish was imaged to
cover the full area of the dish. A bounding grid that consisted of
39 × 45 tiles with 10% overlap was used for stitching.

Lipid
Order Measurements
The lateral organization of
the membrane lipids, also referred to as lipid packing, was quantified
using a microscope-based spectral imaging technique.33,51 For this purpose, an aliquot (100 μL) of GUV-rich solution
was placed in an imaging well. The vesicles were then fluorescently
labeled with a final concentration of 400 nM c-Laurdan, an environment-sensitive
molecular probe. The solution was then diluted with 100 μL of
PBS. In the case of the experiment relating lipid packing to electrode
material, 400 μL of PBS was added to the solution.

The
emission spectrum of c-Laurdan shifts as a function of the dipolar
water relaxation and thus the level of hydration within its surrounding
microenvironment, indicating lipid packing in membranes. GP52 was employed as a relative measure of lipid
packing on a scale of −1 to 1, where −1 represents the
least-packed membrane and 1 represents the most-packed membrane. Equation 1 describes the GP
relative to the intensities at two specific wavelengths: 440 (I440) and 490 nm (I490). 1  Spectral imaging was performed
using a Zeiss
LSM780 confocal microscope equipped with a 32-channel GaAsP detector
array. The vesicles were excited at 405 nm, and the spectral intensity
of the signal was recorded in the 415–691 nm range.

ICP-OES
Experiments
The concentration of metal ions
in the electroformed samples was measured by ICP-OES with a Varian
Vista-MPX spectrometer, for both electrode materials.

Lipid Extraction
and NMR Experiments
The samples for
NMR analysis were prepared from nine simultaneous electroformation
experiments. The content of each electroformation chamber (3 mL) was
diluted with an equal volume of PBS in a 50 mL Falcon tube, which
was then left to stand overnight at room temperature. The GUV-enriched
layers (500 μL each) were then withdrawn from the bottom of
each Falcon tube, combined, and freeze-dried. The lipids were then
extracted from the dried GUV samples by the Bligh and Dyer method.53 Briefly, the sample was dispersed in water (0.8
mL), and then methanol (2 mL) and chloroform (1 mL) were added with
mixing after each addition. The sample was vortexed at 2500 rpm for
15 s and allowed to stand for 30 min. Chloroform (1 mL) and water
(1 mL) were added, and the sample was centrifuged at 1000g for 5 min to achieve a complete phase separation. The bottom organic
layer was withdrawn using a glass syringe, dried under a nitrogen
stream, and redissolved in CDCl3 (600 μL) for analysis.

LMV control samples with different lipid concentrations were prepared
using the lipid hydration method. A solution of DOPC in chloroform
was added to a glass vial and dried under a nitrogen stream. The lipid
film was then hydrated by adding the same sucrose solution used for
electroformation and vortexed for 2 min at 2500 rpm. After adding
an equal volume of PBS, the sample was left to stand at room temperature
for 18 h. The lipids were then extracted with the same protocol used
for the electroformed sample.

1H NMR spectra were
acquired on a Bruker Ascend 400
spectrometer (at 400 MHz for 1H and at 162 MHz for 31P) with 30° pulses (Bruker zg30 sequence) and a 3 s
relaxation delay on a spectral width of 8000 Hz, whereas 31P NMR spectra were acquired with proton decoupling and a 3 s relaxation
delay on a spectral width of 64 103 Hz. The spectra were apodized
by multiplication with an exponential decay equivalent to 0.5 Hz line
broadening and a Gaussian function equivalent to 1 Hz line broadening. 1H NMR spectra were referenced to residual nondeuterated chloroform,
whereas 31P NMR spectra were externally referenced to triphenylphosphine
oxide.

Vesicle Unilamellarity
Three independent suspensions
of fluorescently labeled vesicles were prepared using the electroformation
protocol outlined previously, by depositing a mixture of DOPC and
NBD-PE (1 mol %) in chloroform on the electrodes. The GUV suspension
(2.7 mL) was then mixed with 300 μL of a HEPES buffer at pH
7 (0.1 M HEPES and 1 M NaCl) to obtain final concentrations of 10
mM HEPES and 100 mM NaCl. Three wells of a 96-well plate were filled
with 200 μL of the buffered GUV suspension. Stable values of
fluorescence intensity were measured at 520 nm on a FLUOstar Omega
plate reader (BMG Labtech) before and after adding 4 μL of a
freshly prepared solution of 1 M Na2S2O4 in 1 M Tris buffer at pH 10, with excitation at 485 nm. Subsequently,
20 μL of a 10% v/v solution of Triton X-100 was added to the
solution to cause vesicle lysis and expose all lipid structures to
the quencher. A final stable value of fluorescence was recorded after
the addition of the detergent. The unilamellarity index, defined as
the fraction of leaflets that are not exposed to the solvent, was
calculated as the ratio of the emission drop caused by the addition
of detergent (Iinterior) to the total
emission drop (Itotal = Iinterior + Iexterior).

Statistical
Analyses
Statistical testing was performed
using one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparison analyses,
whereas a Student’s t-test was employed for
direct comparison between two data sets. All data were expressed in
terms of mean ± standard deviation, and the number of independent
replicates was expressed in the figure captions. The following conventions
for statistical significance are used throughout the paper: ns, p > 0.05; *, p ≤ 0.05, **, p ≤ 0.01; ***, p ≤ 0.001;
****, p ≤ 0.0001.
