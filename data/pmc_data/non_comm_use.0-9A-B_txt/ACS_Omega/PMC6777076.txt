Trichomoniasis is caused by the parasitic
protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. The
increasing prevalence
of strains resistant to the current 5-nitroimidazole treatments creates
the need for novel therapies. T. vaginalis cannot synthesize purine and pyrimidine rings and requires salvage
pathway enzymes to obtain them from host nucleosides. The uridine
nucleoside ribohydrolase was screened using an 19F NMR-based
activity assay against a 2000-compound fragment diversity library.
Several series of inhibitors were identified including scaffolds based
on acetamides, cyclic ureas or ureas, pyridines, and pyrrolidines.
A number of potent singleton compounds were identified, as well. Eighteen
compounds with IC50 values of 20 μM or lower were
identified, including some with ligand efficiency values of 0.5 or
greater. Detergent and jump-dilution counter screens validated all
scaffold classes as target-specific, reversible inhibitors. Identified
scaffolds differ substantially from 5-nitroimidazoles. Medicinal chemistry
using the structure–activity relationship emerging from the
fragment hits is being pursued to discover nanomolar inhibitors.

Introduction
Trichomoniasis is the
most common sexually transmitted nonviral
infection worldwide.1 The World Health
Organization estimated that there were 276.4 million cases in 2008
with 90% of these cases occurring in resource-limited areas.1 In the United States, an estimated 3.7 million
cases were reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.2 Once infected, a person is more likely to become
infected with chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes simplex viruses type-1
and type-2, HIV, syphilis, and other sexually transmitted diseases.2−4 Infections also increase the risk of developing bacterial vaginosis,
candidiasis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and cervical and prostate
cancer; pregnant women infected with trichomoniasis have an increased
risk for low birth weight and preterm delivery.2,3 Trichomonas
is caused by the parasite Trichomonas vaginalis, a flagellated protozoan that is pyriform in shape. The majority
of the time, T. vaginalis inhabits
the squamous epithelium of the genital tract, performing fermentation
using carbohydrates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions.3

The current treatments for T. vaginalis infection are 5-nitroimidazoles.5,6 This class
of compounds, including metronidazole and tinidazole, is activated
in the parasite’s hydrogenosomes; the nitro group is reduced
by pyruvate–ferredoxin oxidoreductase creating toxic nitro
radical anions, which damage thymine and adenine residues in the parasite’s
DNA, causing the DNA to be cleaved and subsequent parasitic death.5,6 Infections resulting from 5-nitroimidazole-resistant strains of T. vaginalis, however, are becoming more widespread,
accounting for 5–17% of infections depending on the country.7 New antitrichomonal agents with a mechanism of
action distinct from existing drugs would provide a second line of
therapy and would improve outcomes for the increasing number of patients
with drug-resistant T. vaginalis infections.

Potential antitrichomonal drug targets include purine and pyrimidine
salvage pathway enzymes. T. vaginalis lacks de novo biosynthetic pathways for purine and pyrimidine rings
and relies on salvage pathway enzymes to metabolize nucleosides harvested
from host cells.8−10 The first step in these salvage pathways is the hydrolysis
of nucleosides into their nucleobase and ribose components. The responsible
enzymes belong to a superfamily of structurally related calcium-containing
nucleoside ribohydrolases (NHs).11 Previous
studies have shown that all NHs have an active site highly specific
to ribose, while specificity for the nucleobases is highly variable.11 Despite the variability in substrate specificity
of NHs, all enzymes of this class contain a Ca2+ cation
deep within their active site coordinated by several conserved aspartic
acid residues. The ribose portion of the nucleoside coordinates the
Ca2+ cation via its 2′- and 3′-hydroxyl groups
positioning the glycosidic bond for hydrolysis. A water molecule is
also coordinated by the Ca2+ cation activating it for base-catalyzed
hydrolysis of the N-glycosidic bond.11

While the ribose pockets of NH structures are highly
conserved,
the nucleobase pocket is more variable. The T. vaginalis genome12 contains three confirmed NHs
that we have cloned and characterized. Two are specific for purines,
adenosine/guanosine nucleoside hydrolase (AGNH)13 and guanosine/adenosine/cytidine nucleoside hydrolase (GACNH),14 while the third is specific for pyrimidines,
uridine nucleoside hydrolase (UNH).15 Expressed
sequence tags have been reported for all three T. vaginalis NHs.16 The transcriptome of T. vaginalis under anaerobic conditions has been
compared to that after exposure to oxygen and to vaginal epithelial
cells17 and has also been studied in response
to glucose restriction.18 Interestingly,
transcripts for UNH were found to be up to 50-fold greater in number
than those for either AGNH or GACNH depending on growth conditions.
This might indicate the unique role played by this pyrimidine nucleoside
ribohydrolase. Pyrimidine metabolism has been extensively studied
in the related parasite Trypanosoma bruceibrucei, which, in contrast to T. vaginalis, is capable of both de novo biosynthesis
and salvage of pyrimidines.19 However, T. brucei brucei genetically modified to lack de
novo pyrimidine biosynthesis capability was found to be completely
dependent on salvage pathways, with the absence of pyrimidines in
growth media rapidly lethal.20 The addition
of uracil returned growth rates to normal, while the addition of uridine
only partially restored growth rates. This provides strong evidence
that inhibiting the pyrimidine salvage pathway in T.
vaginalis will be lethal to the parasite since this
pathway represents its sole pyrimidine source.

We previously
determined that UNH is a druggable target by developing
an 19F NMR-based activity assay and then using it to screen
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Compound Collection
for inhibitors.15 Although the compounds
in this collection have relatively large molar masses and lack chemical
diversity, several benzimidazole-containing proton–pump inhibitors
were identified as low micromolar inhibitors including omeprazole
shown in Figure 1.
Omeprazole has an IC50 value of 2.3 μM, but its relatively
large molar mass of 345 g/mol combined with only modest ligand efficiency
(LE)21,22 of 0.36 (heavy atom count of 24) makes it
a poor starting point for drug design.23 A small hit deconstruction effort identified the fragment 2-methylthiobenzimidazole
shown in Figure 1 that
has a molar mass of 164 g/mol and a much higher LE of 0.53 (heavy
atom count of 11). These metrics suggest that 2-methylthiobenzimidazole
could potentially be developed into a nanomolar inhibitor with a final
molar mass less than 500 Da.23,24 The relatively easy
hit deconstruction of a modestly potent compound identified from a
sampling of limited chemical diversity suggested that screening a
large and diverse fragment library might identify multiple structure
classes with better prospects for medicinal chemistry efforts.

Results
and Discussion
The 19F NMR-based activity assay
monitors the conversion
of 5-fluorouridine to 5-fluorouracil and ribose.15 While the reaction could also be monitored using 1H NMR of uridine/uracil, 19F NMR is advantageous because
of the lack of possible overlaps with signals from the fragments themselves
and its comparable sensitivity to 1H NMR.25 Further, since the same two substrate and product 19F NMR signals are observed in every reaction, the effects
of relaxation and chemical shift anisotropy that can complicate ligand-based 19F NMR screening methods are not a concern here.26 The 50 μM concentration of 5-fluorouridine
in the assay is three times its Km value
of 15 μM creating assay conditions optimized for detecting inhibitors
with competitive, noncompetitive, or uncompetitive mechanisms.26 At the 333 μM fragment concentrations
screened, a competitive fragment inhibitor would need to have a KI of only 77 μM to result in 50% inhibition.

Mixtures of six fragments were initially screened, with mixtures
that exhibited at least 75% inhibition subsequently deconvoluted to
determine the individual inhibitory fragments. Figure 2 shows typical spectra for six mixtures along
with the 0 and 30 min control spectra. Only the substrate signal at
−165.8 ppm is observed in the 0 min control spectrum, while
both the substrate signal and a new product signal at −169.2
ppm are observed in the 30 min control spectrum. The product peak
is also present in all mixture spectra except that for mixture 5, suggesting that at least one compound in mixture 5 is an inhibitor of UNH. Figure 3 shows the spectra for the deconvolution
of mixture 5 using its six individual components. The
product peak is present in all compounds tested with the exception
of fragment G7. The absence of the product peak at −169.2 ppm
indicates that fragment G7 fully inhibits UNH at 333 μM. The
observation of residual substrate signals for fragments C8 and D8
indicates that these fragments are also inhibitors but much weaker.
Fragments demonstrating 75% or greater inhibition in the deconvolution
assays were assayed in five-point serial dilutions down to 1.3 μM.
Fragment IC50 values or percent inhibition at 333 μM
were then determined. A total of 33 fragments selected to represent
the various chemical classes of inhibitors were obtained as solid
samples to confirm activity. These compounds were dissolved in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) and retested from 1.33 mM to 0.33 μM, as shown
in Figure 4 for fragment
G7. The IC50 value for fragment G7 (subsequently referred
to as fragment 7) calculated from this data is 45 μM.

Figure 2 19F NMR reaction spectra for the 0 and 30 min controls
and six mixtures. The maximum intensities of the substrate (−165.8
ppm) and product (−169.2 ppm) signals are observed in the 0
and 30 min controls, respectively.

A total of 97 fragments exhibited inhibition against
UNH (4.9%
hit rate). Several series of inhibitors with emerging structure–activity
relationship (SAR) were identified including scaffolds based on acetamides,
cyclic ureas or ureas, pyridines, and pyrrolidines. A number of potent
singleton compounds were identified, as well. A singleton was defined
as having no other closely related fragments in the screen, based
on substructure searching of the core scaffold. Among the active fragments
were 18 compounds with IC50 values of 20 μM or lower,
including some with ligand efficiency values of 0.5 or greater. The
structures, IC50 values, and LE values for nine fragments
representative of the most common scaffolds are shown in Table 1. A total of 55 structural
analogs of the most potent fragments were also obtained and tested.
The emerging SAR from these fragments and the original screening hits
are discussed below.

and LE Values of the Most Common Fragment Scaffoldsa
a Values are the average of n = 2.

Interestingly, several of the fragment
classes contain moieties
that are components of active compounds identified in our previous
screen of the NIH Clinical Compound Collection. For instance, the
2,3-substituted pyridine ring of fragments 4 and 5 is one component of the prazole class of compounds represented
by omeprazole in Figure 1. The phenylpyridine component of fragment 7 is also
very nearly the core 4-phenyl-1,4-dihydropyridine scaffold of the
dipine compounds, such as nifedipine and nicardipine, which were the
largest class of hits in the previous screen. Thus, the SAR from the
previous NIH Clinical Compound Collection can be integrated in some
circumstances in the context of the SAR from this emerging work to
advance selected hit series.

All compound structural classes
were validated as reversible, target-specific
inhibitors based on four criteria.27 First,
the fragment library was designed to exclude PAINS chemotypes,28 and this was verified for the fragments shown
in Table 1 using ZINC.29 Further, the fragments shown in Table 1 were analyzed by the program
Badapple, an algorithm that detects likely patterns of promiscuity
in molecular scaffolds.30 High scores were
indicated only for fragments containing biphenyl, phenylpyrrolidine,
and pyridine chemotypes. Second, the lack of reporter enzymes in the
NMR-based activity assays eliminates the possibility of false positives
acting by this interference mechanism. Third, detergent counter screens
were carried out to reduce the incidence of false positives arising
from colloidal aggregates that can mimic inhibition by blocking the
enzyme’s active site.31 The Shoichet
protocol was used to test for aggregation-based inhibition, where
the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 will prevent aggregates from interacting
with the enzyme nonspecifically.31 If activity
diminishes markedly with detergent, the compound is most likely an
aggregator. Figure 5 demonstrates the effect of detergent on the inhibition observed
for fragment 7. Both control reactions have approximately
50% conversion of substrate to product, while reactions with 100 μM
fragment 7 in the absence and presence of 0.01% Triton
X-100 detergent show close to complete inhibition. Lack of significant
change in potency with or without detergent indicates that the inhibition
observed for fragment 7 is likely not aggregation-based.
Similar results were obtained for all other fragments tested, indicating
that all classes are target-specific inhibitors. In these experiments, 19F NMR is actually disadvantageous compared to 1H NMR. When using the latter, resonances from the fragments themselves
are often simultaneously indicative of well-behaved, soluble compounds.32,33 Fourth, jump-dilution assays were carried out to confirm that the
fragment hits are noncovalent, reversible inhibitors.34 Jump-dilution assays include a parallel incubation of the
enzyme and compound at 200 μM before initiating normal reaction
assays at 200 and 20 μM (10-fold dilution). Fragment 7 completely inhibited UNH at 200 μM, as shown in Figure 6. Full inhibition is expected
since the fragment concentration is 4-fold higher than its IC50 value of 45 μM. However, upon rapid dilution to 20
μM before initiating the reaction, UNH inhibition dropped to
54%, as shown in Figure 6. Loss of activity indicates dissociation of the compound from the
active site. Similar results were obtained for all other fragments
tested, indicating that all classes are noncovalent, reversible inhibitors.
Fragment SAR and dose–response curve shapes also suggest that
the identified fragments are suitable for follow-up studies.

μM fragment 7 (A, C) in the absence or presence

concentrations are indicated.

The impetus to screen a fragment diversity library came from the
observation that fragments with high LE values could be identified
from larger-molecular-weight inhibitors, as shown in Figure 1. Screening a large set of
diverse fragments might then lead to the identification of one or
more scaffolds more optimal for medicinal chemistry elaboration. Identification
of scaffold classes with more than five representatives indicates
the success of the fragment approach and provides excellent starting
points for ongoing work. Further, the scaffold classes identified
are markedly different from those identified in our previous fragment
screen of the same library against the purine-specific AGNH enzyme.
Of the 60 fragments with IC50 values <100 μM for
UNH, only nine also had IC50 values <100 μM for
AGNH. This suggests that while the ribose binding pockets of the AGNH
and UNH active sites are likely very similar, the nucleobase binding
pockets possess markedly different molecular complementarities.

Several scaffold classes contain fragments with LE values greater
than 0.5, indicating that the majority of the atoms make favorable
interactions in the active site. It is important to start out with
high LE values since during the optimization process, the efficiency
will only remain the same or decrease as the size of the molecule
is increased.23 For instance, the molar
masses and LE values for all of the fragments in Table 1 with the exception of fragment 6 suggest that they can each be developed into nanomolar inhibitors
with final molar masses less than 500 Da provided that LE remains
constant as molar mass increases. Thus, the fragment screening output
provides at least four chemical scaffolds that are attractive starting
points for a chemical optimization program. Some fragments and fragment
classes also appear to have overlapping structural features that may
suggest fragment merging strategies, as well.

The 3-hydroxypyrrolidine
fragment 9 is compelling
for its combination of potency, LE, and emerging SAR. Figure 7 compares the structure of
fragment 9 with that of uridine. Interestingly, the inhibitor
has almost one-third greater LE than the enzyme’s natural substrate.
The lower LE for the substrate results from some of the binding energy
being used to lower the activation energy for the reaction, thus reducing
binding affinity. Inhibitors (nonsubstrates) do not have this limitation
and thus can have higher LE values. There are, at present, no reported
structures of pyrimidine-specific nucleoside hydrolases with a bound
heterocyclic nucleobase in the active site. However, modeling studies
on the pyrimidine-specific enzymes from Escherichia
coli and Sulfolobus solfataricus indicate that both contain hydrophilic residues lining the active
site that could potentially hydrogen-bond with the polar regions of
fragment 9 and the substrate.35,36 In addition, both fragment 9 and uridine have 6-membered
aromatic/heteroaromatic rings that have a hydrophobic face that may
make similar interactions in the active site. Both structures also
contain 5-membered, saturated rings with attached hydroxyl groups.
The pyrrolidine moiety of fragment 9 likely interacts
with the ribose pocket of the active site. As previously discussed,
nucleoside hydrolases have a highly conserved Ca2+ cation
within their active sites.11 Fragment 9 has a hydroxyl group in a similar position as uridine. It
is highly probable that this hydroxyl group is interacting with the
Ca2+ cation in the same manner as the 2′ hydroxyl
group in uridine. Modeling and X-ray crystallography studies to validate
these interactions and to guide inhibitor design are in progress.

IC50 or Km value,
and LE values for fragment 9 and uridine.

A total of six 3-hydroxypyrrolidines were identified as inhibitors
including fragments 8 and 9 from the original
fragment library and fragments 10–13 shown in Table 2 from
the fragment hit structural analogs tested. Replacement of the methylamino
group in fragment 9 with a nitrile group in fragment 10 improved potency, with fragment 10 having
an IC50 value of 13 μM. By contrast, the addition
of two meta methyl groups as in fragment 11, a para ethyl
group as in fragment 8, and an ethoxy group as in fragment 12 resulted in a steady decrease in potency compared to that
in fragment 9. This suggests either a steric hindrance
or a limit to the hydrophobic character in this region of the active
site and that the nonpolar edge of the uracil-like ring is a poor
vector for picking up new interactions. Further, the pyridine ring
fragment 13 had only barely detectable activity suggesting
that the ring nitrogen is in the wrong position to pick up similar
interactions in the active site that are responsible for substrate
specificity. Adding hydrogen-bonding groups that mimic those of the
uracil ring may improve activity.

Conclusions
Fragment hits identified here provide ideal
starting points to
synthesize the tool compounds required to demonstrate that UNH inhibition
is correlated with antitrichomonal activity. This will require improvements
in UNH potency by several orders of magnitude, down into the 10 nM
range. In addition to having small molecular weight and favorable
aqueous solubility, the diverse compounds in the fragment library
were selected for their potential to be elaborated on using medicinal
chemistry protocols. Thus, the scaffolds identified with high ligand
efficiencies can be chemically expanded using known synthetic organic
chemistry approaches. This process will enable the development of
larger compounds with improved UNH activity that meet the criteria
for in vitro testing. Inhibitors active against T.
vaginalis may also be broadly applicable to other
neglected parasites that require nucleoside hydrolase enzymes for
their survival such as Leishmania donovani.37

Experimental Section
NMR data sets were acquired on a Bruker AvanceIII 500 MHz spectrometer
using a BBFO probe. 19F{1H} NMR spectra were
acquired using inverse-gated decoupling with WALTZ-16.38 Spectra were the average of 256 scans and included
acquisition and relaxation delay times of 0.872 s and 4.0 s, respectively. 19F chemical shifts were referenced to external 50 μM
trifluoroethanol at −76.7 ppm. The physical properties of the
1963 fragments screened, a diversity-based subset of the AstraZeneca
fragment library, have been described previously.33

Sequentially, 3 μL of 10 mM 5-fluorouridine
and 2 μL
of each fragment to be tested were added to microfuge tubes. Reactions
were then initiated using a stock solution consisting of 50 mM potassium
phosphate and 0.3 M KCl at pH 6.5, 10% 2H2O,
and 80 nM UNH to give a final volume of 600 μL. Reactions were
quenched after 30 min with 10 μL of 1.5 M HCl. The highest DMSO
concentrations used were 2%, which did not measurably affect enzyme
activity. In all cases, control reactions were also run by quenching
at 0 and 30 min in the presence of the same DMSO concentration but
the absence of fragments. Serial dilution assays were carried out
in duplicate and analyzed as previously described, maintaining a constant
DMSO concentration for each dilution.33

Jump-dilution and detergent counter screens were carried out
as
previously described.32,33 The IC50 values of
the fragments used in these experiments were well suited to the 200
and 20 μM fragment concentrations used in the jump-dilution
assays, as well as the 100 and 50 μM fragment concentrations
used in the detergent assays.
