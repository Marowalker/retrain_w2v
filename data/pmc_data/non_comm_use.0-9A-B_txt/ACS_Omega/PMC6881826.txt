Mesoporous layered magnetic hybrid
GFP2 composed of C3N3S3 polymers,
Fe3O4 nanoparticles
(Fe3O4 NPs), and graphene oxide with a mesoporous
layered “sandwich”-like structure was successfully explored
by in situ simple polymerization tactic for rapid removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+ from water. It shows good selectivity
and high adsorption capacity (277.78 and 49.75 mg/g) for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. It exhibits the fast adsorption
kinetics (>80% elimination efficiency in less than 30 min). The
Langmuir isotherm model based on typical monomolecular layer adsorption
fits better with the data of adsorption than the Freundlich isotherm
model. The adsorption process of GFP2 for Pb2+ and Cd2+ can be explained well with the pseudo-second-order kinetics
model. GFP2 is a kind of recyclable solid absorbent, which is an excellent
candidate in the heavy metal wastewater treatment. More importantly,
GFP2 was set with Fe3O4 NPs which makes it easily
separable from wastewater with an extra magnet.

Introduction
With the
rapid development of urbanization and industrialization,
lots of toxic pollutants (organic waste and heavy metal ions) release
into the environment.1 Unlike organic waste,
heavy metal ions once released into the environment cannot be biodegraded.
They usually enter water from air or soil in a variety of ways because
of their solubility.2 The heavy metal pollution
of water not only affects millions of people worldwide and is a leading
global risk factor for illness and death but also affects organisms
and plants living in rivers, lakes, oceans, and ground water.3−7 Inorganic lead and cadmium are among the
most highly toxic water pollutants, which originate from metal smelting,
plating, tanneries, battery manufacture, pigment manufacture, petroleum
refining, etc.8−10 Lead
(Pb) is harmful to the human organ system most notably the nervous,
renal, and reproductive systems, and, more importantly, children are
particularly sensitive to lead exposure as it causes mental retardation
at lower lead levels.11,12 Cadmium (Cd) is a well-known
toxic heavy metal with a destructive impact on most organ systems
in the aquatic environment. It can cause liver damage, renal dysfunction,
lung insufficiency, bone degeneration, and hypertension in humans.13,14 Therefore, a lot of researchers have made enormous contribution
for the removal of lead and cadmium from polluted water. Traditional
sewage treatment technology which includes solvent extraction, aggregation,
ion exchange, and membrane separation cannot separate the dissolved
heavy metal ions completely from contaminated water.15,16 Artificial adsorbents offer a promising way to overcome current
difficulties and show outstanding performances on lead and cadmium
separation from contaminated water, especially nanomaterial-based
adsorbents. Up to now, a lot of artificial nanoadsorbents for the
elimination of lead and cadmium have been developed. Such as, nanometal
oxide,17 silicon-based nanomaterials,18 titanosilicate zeolites,19,20 polymers,21,22 nanocarbon materials,23−25 biochar,26,27 and others.28−30 However, most
of these adsorbents are either complicated
to produce or too costly for large-scale industrial production. Thus,
the development of new nanoadsorbents and evaluating their adsorption
properties are key factors for applying artificial adsorbent technology.

Trimercaptos-triazine-trisodium salt (Na3C3N3S3, TMT-15), which is a widely used homogeneous
aqueous solution adsorbent in the wastewater treatment, has excellent
chelation ability with almost all of the heavy metal ions.31,32 However, TMT-15 is used in the form of aqueous solution so it is
difficult to regenerate and recycle. Graphene oxide (GO), which has
a large theoretical surface area and rich oxygen functional groups,
is an ideal candidate to develop a new promising nanoadsorbent for
heavy metal removal.33,34 In particular, magnetic GO-based
nanoadsorbents have attracted much attention because of their high
adsorption capacities and simple magnetic separation.35−37 Thus, anchoring Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) onto
the large surface area of GO and in situ polymerization with Na3C3N3S3 might be a promising
method to overcome the above difficulties.

In this paper, mesoporous
layered GO/C3N3S3 polymer hybrids
(GP) and GO /Fe3O4/C3N3S3 polymer hybrids (GFP) are first prepared for highly
efficient and rapid removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+ from contaminated water through in situ polymerization and interface-induced
co-assembly methods. GFP nanocomposites were prepared by anchoring
Fe3O4 NPs onto the surface of GO and in situ
polymerization with Na3C3N3S3. In comparison with that, GP nanocomposites were prepared
in a similar way except without Fe3O4 NPs. The
physical and chemical characterization of the prepared adsorbents
was conducted to analyze their composition and structure, such as
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction
(XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Moreover, a series of
small batch experiments are carried out to investigate the adsorption
property.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of GP and GFP
The
structure and morphology of the as-obtained adsorbents were first
characterized by SEM. Figures 1 and S1 are typical SEM photos
of the P, GP, and GFP, respectively. Figure S1 displays many granules of irregular shape (200 nm to 10 μm),
which are made up of a mass of nanoparticles. The pure polymer P particles
accumulate in a random way, whereas the GP and GFP hybrids pack in
a“sandwich”-like layered way (Figure 1). The layered structure formed by the ordered
stacking of the C3N3S3 polymer and
GO is clearly discernible for the six hybrids. In Figure 2, TEM images of GP and GFP
hybrids show the porous network morphology. For GFP, it was observed
that magnetite Fe3O4NPs sized about 8–12
nm and a part of their clusters were dispersed and embedded in the
backbone of the GFP network. The morphology of GO was also investigated
by TEM. As seen from Figure 2, the copper grid substrates are covered with a lot of thin
films with many wrinkles, indicating the existence of GO.

The
XRD patterns of P, GP, and GFP are shown in Figure 3. No obvious sharp diffraction peaks were
observed for P and GP except for a steamed bread peak, which may be
attributed to the amorphous status of P. For Fe3O4 and GFP, there are seven diffraction peaks appeared at 30.2°,
35.6°, 43.3°, 53.7°, 57.3°, 62.8°, and 74.9°,
which could be assigned to the (220), (311), (400), (422), (511),
(440), and (533) planes of the cubic spinel crystal structure of Fe3O4 with the cell constant a =
8.39 Å (JCPDS card no. 19-0629).38,39 The characteristic
peak of GO at 10.4°40 was not observed
in GP and GFP, which might be covered up by the amorphous polymer
matrices.

of P, GP, and GFP.

XPS was used to further
study the detailed surface
elemental composition information of P, GP, and GFP (Figures 4 and 5). Figure 4a shows
that the spectrum of P and GP had five peaks (S 2p, S 2s, C 1s, N
1s, and O 1s) while GFP had six sharp peaks (S 2p, S 2s, C 1s, N 1s,
O 1s, and Fe 2p) in the survey scan spectrum. Higher-resolution XPS
spectra were also determined to further study the electronic states
of S, C, N, and Fe. Peaks located at 724.3 and 711.3 eV appeared in
the Fe 2p spectrum (Figure 4b), consistent with Fe 2p1/2 and Fe 2p3/2, indicating the appearance of Fe3O4 NPs in
hybrid GFP.41 The relative integral ratio
of the Fe element for GFP evidently became bigger from GFP1 to GFP3,
which are corresponding to content of Fe3O4 NPs.
In the S 2p spectrum (Figure 5), peaks for S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 were
observed at 168.9, 165.8, 165.0, and 164.3 eV, respectively, which
are higher than those in the precursor H3C3N3S3.42 It showed that
C3N3S3 has been successfully grafted
on GO. Four different peaks centered at 284.7, 285.4, 287.9, and 290.4
eV were observed in the C 1s deconvolution spectrum of GP and GFP,
corresponding to C=C/C–C/C–H in aromatic rings,
C–O, C=O, and O–C=O groups, respectively,
signifying the existence of GO in the composites.34 In Figure 5, the results of high-resolution of N 1s scan were fitted with three
components at 399.4, 400.2, and 404.0 eV, signifying the formation
of nitrogen-containing aromatic polymers in the composites.43 From the XPS spectra, we can conclude that GP
and GFP were successfully obtained.

and GFP: (a) survey scan,

and GFP: S 2p spectra,

FTIR, a useful technique
for identifying the detailed structure of the matter at a molecular
scale, was used to certify the formation of the GP and GFP hybrids.
As is shown in Figure 6, four different strong bands displayed at 1723, 1476, 1233, and
824 cm–1, which are assigned to the stretching vibration
of the C=N bond, the six-membered ring of symmetrical triazines,
the C–N group, and the out-of-plane bending vibration of symmetrical
triazines, which indicates the formation of polymerization.44 The absorption bands near 1636 and 1124 cm–1, are assigned to the stretching vibration of C–N
and C=S bonds, corresponding to the formation of thione, which
is one kind of terminal group in the polymerization (C3N3S3) chain.32 FTIR
analysis showed the characteristic peaks of O–H (3382 cm–1), C=O (1733 cm–1), C=C
(1615 cm–1), and C–O (1274 and 1052 cm–1) for GO.57 Obviously,
most of the characteristic peaks appeared in GP and GFP hybrids, while
some of them overlapped with other peaks. The broad and weak band
at 565 cm–1, corresponds to the Fe–O bond,
which certifies the existence of Fe3O4 NPs in
the GFP hybrids.45 Moreover, the absorption
bands near 1637 and 3440 cm–1 referred to the H–O–H
bending mode and O–H stretching mode, respectively, showing
the existence of interstitial water in the hybrids.

Figure 6 FTIR profiles
of P, GP, and GFP.

As is shown
in Figure S2, further information for the
preparation of GFP is provided by the TGA curves in the oxygen atmosphere.
From 200 to 600 °C, GP and GFP both showed an obvious mass loss,
which corresponded to the combustion of GO and P. It was certain that
Fe3O4 was oxidized to Fe2O3 during the whole process. So, with the degradation of Fe3O4NP content, the last hybrid weight degraded.

In
order to research the adsorption process and the specific surface
area of the magnetic adsorbent GFP, the pore size distribution and
BET specific surface area of the GFP samples (Figure S3) were determined by the N2 adsorption
and desorption experiments. From the N2 sorption isotherm
at 77.3 K, we found that GFP1, GFP2, and GFP3 all showed classic IUPAC-IV
adsorption behavior with a BET specific surface area of 133.3, 123.8,
and 103.3 m2/g, individually. The Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
sorption average pore width (4V/A) are 12.3 nm (GFP1), 11.6 nm (GFP2), and 10.3 nm (GFP3), respectively.
The aperture distribution of hybrids showed that all kinds of particles
have a narrow dimensional range (2–50 nm). It can be declared
that the adsorbents we prepared are all mesoporous materials.

Effects
of pH and Adsorption Isotherms
During the simple adsorption
experiment, the adsorbent GFP1 showed
so weak magnetic force that it became difficult to separate from water
by an extra magnet after adsorption. It also indicated that their
removal capacity to Pb2+ (or Cd2+) are as follow:
GFP1 > GFP2 > GFP3. Thus, we use GFP2 to do further experiment
research. The pH value is one of the most important parameters affecting
the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent to the heavy metal ions.
In order to study the dependences of the adsorption capacity for Pb2+ (or Cd2+) on the pH value (2.0–7.0) over
GFP2. In Figure 7,
it showed the mass of Pb2+ (or Cd2+) adsorbed
per unit mass of GFP2 (qt, mg/g) at different pH. Obviously, the qt increased when the pH values changed from 2.0 to
6.0, and it reduced obviously as the pH further increased. Notably,
the adsorption maximal value appeared at pH = 6.0. It is consistent
with the zeta potential value of bulk C3N3S3 polymer (−33.5 mV at pH = 6.7) in the literature.46

Figure 7 Influence of
pH.

The adsorption equilibrium isotherms
provide
rich information about surface properties, adsorption mechanisms,
and the affinity of the adsorbent to the adsorbate.47 It dictates the quantity of adsorbents needed when they
are used in heavy metal pollution of water. In the paper, the adsorption
of Pb2+ (or Cd2+) with different initial concentrations
(25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 mg/L) was researched
for 24 h at room temperature and pH = 6.0. To determine the mechanistic
parameters associated with Pb2+ (or Cd2+) adsorption,
we analyzed the experimental data using the commonly applied Langmuir
and Freundlich isotherm models (Figures 8 and S4).48,49 The Langmuir and Freundlich equations are given as 1   2  where Ce is the final
equilibrium concentration of adsorbate
solution (mg/L), qe is the mass of the
adsorbate which are adsorbed by per unit heft of the adsorbent (mg/g), Qmax is the maximum theoretical monolayer adsorption
capacity (mg/g), b (L/mg) and KF are the Langmuir and Freundlich constant, and n is the indicators of the adsorption intensity. Fitting of the isotherm
data and the Pb2+ and Cd2+ sorption constants
obtained with the Langmuir and Freundlich models for GFP2 are showed
in Table 1. The data
indicate that the correlation coefficients R2 of Langmuir is much bigger than those of Freundlich. It demonstrates
that the Langmuir model is well in agreement with the observation
data, showing that the nanoadsorbent surface is the monolayer occupied
by Pb2+ (Cd2+). However, the R2 of Freundlich was 0.954 (Pb2+) and 0.947
(Cd2+), indicating that the multilayer sorption of Pb2+ (Cd2+) onto GFP2 also appeared during the adsorption
process. The Qmax value from the adsorption
of GFP2 for Pb2+ and Cd2+ are 277.78 and 49.75
mg/g, respectively, at 298 K. Table 2 presents the adsorption capacities for Pb2+ and Cd2+ in water on various solid adsorbents. The maximum
adsorption capacity to Pb2+ is much smaller than the high-efficiency
Pb2+ adsorbents (e.g., flowerlike MgO nanostructures and
PTMT exhibiting capacities of 1980.0 and 375.9 mg/g),17,32 and is much higher than a lot of reported adsorbents (e.g., TMU-5,
modified cellulose, and Fe2O3@AlO(OH) exhibit
capacities of 29.6–251.0 mg/g).50−52 The maximum adsorption
capacity to Cd2+ is much smaller than the high-efficiency
Cd2+ adsorbents
(e.g., flowerlike MgO nanostructures and PEI-grafted gelatin sponge
exhibiting capacities of 1500.0 and 65.0 mg/g),17,53 and
is more than those of the gelatin sponge (9.35 mg/g).53 The n value is small which indicates that
the chemical adsorption strength between them are high, which was
in accordance with KF and shows that Pb2+ is easier to be fixed on to GFP2 than Cd2+.

Adsorption Process and Adsorption Kinetics
In order to estimate
the equilibrium time and determine the adsorption
rate, dependence of the amount adsorbed for Pb2+ (Cd2+) on the contact time is shown in Figure 9. We set the initial concentration of Pb2+ (Cd2+) at 100 mg/L, and conducted the experiments
at pH = 6 and room temperature. The large BET surface area and the
mesoporous structure in GFP2 are specially reflected in the fast kinetics
of Pb2+ (Cd2+) adsorption by GFP2, which showed
that >80% elimination efficiency within only 30 min of Pb2+ (Cd2+)/GFP2 contact. It also showed that the initial
rapid adsorption takes place in the first stage (0–30 min)
and then gradually increases to reach an equilibrium value in approximately
2 h (Pb2+) and 3 h (Cd2+), respectively.

Figure 9 Adsorption
process of GFP2 to Pb2+(Cd2+).

In order to better understand the adsorption process, the
adsorption
kinetic plots were analyzed using a pseudo-second-order kinetics model,47 based on the assumption that chemisorption is
the rate-determining step. The equation is given below 3  where qt is the quantity of the adsorbate
adsorbed per unit mass of
the adsorbent (mg/g) at given time t (min). qe is the amount of the adsorbate adsorbed per
unit weight of the adsorbent (mg/g) when adsorption is up to equilibrium. k2 (g/(mg·min)) is the rate constant of
the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. k2 and qe can be obtained by the intercept
and slope of the linear equation of t/qt versus t. Moreover,
the beginning sorption rate V0 (mg/(g·min))
can be calculated from the following equation 4  

Figure 10 displays the kinetic
plots of t/qt versus t, and Table 3 shows the correlation coefficients and rate
constants of the pseudo-second-order kinetic. From the experimental
results, we can find that the linear plot fits well with the relation
of t/qt versus t, and both R2 have large values (R2 > 0.99), which
indicate that the experimental adsorption data accord well with the
pseudo-second-order kinetics model.

Adsorbent Selectivity, Stability, and Mechanism
Heavy
metals
usually coexist with many other salt ions (e.g. K+, Na+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) in natural waters,
and they often enter water from air or soil through lots of ways.
Surface water, ground water, and sea water are three kinds of common
challenging environment natural waters because of the highest ionic
strength. In the text, the selectivity of adsorbent GFP2 for Pb2+ (Cd2+) are researched in simulated water environments
with the starting Pb2+ (Cd2+) concentrations
of 5, 10, and 25 mg/L, respectively. The affinity of GFP2 for Pb2+ (Cd2+) can be evaluated in terms of the distribution
coefficient (Kd) eq 5(54) 5  where M (g) is the quantity of the adsorbent, and V (mL) is the volume of the experimental solution. Kd conveys the chemical binding affinity of the
adsorbate to the adsorbent, which is very significant at dilute adsorbate
concentrations. In general, a Kd value
of 5000 and above is evaluated good, and 50 000 could be judged
as an excellent level.55Tables 4 and 5 show that the Kd is high, which changed
from 2.551 × 104 to 2.582 × 105 for
Pb2+, while from 4.362 × 104 to 6.842 ×
105 for Cd2+. The results show that the strong
affinity existing between Pb2+ (Cd2+) and GFP2
indicates that usual cations (e.g. K+, Ca2+,
Na+, and Mg2+) do not affect the binding of
Pb2+ (Cd2+) onto the adsorbent of GFP2. It also
shows us that the Kd for Cd2+ is a little higher than the Kd for Pb2+. The high adsorption capacity for Pb2+ (Cd2+) in GFP2 might be reasonably related to the high concentration
of thiol groups in the adsorbent, which is very useful for the coordination
between the thiols and Pb2+ (Cd2+) in the framework
of the material.56 According to the theory
of hard and soft acids and bases (HSAB principle), Cd2+ is classified as a soft acid which tends to have strongest affinity
to S, N, and O functional groups in GFP2, and Pb2+ as an
intermediate acid has medium affinity. In contrast, alkali and alkaline
earth metal ions (e.g. K+, Na+, Ca2+, and Mg2+) identify as hard acids and have the weakest
affinity to GFP2. Thus, the experimental results agreed well with
the HSAB principle.

The secondary pollution
resulting from the
leakage of adsorbent constituents is a common problem during the pollution
treatment process. After each adsorption experiment, the iron concentration
measured in solution is less than 0.001 mmol L–1, which means that the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
do not come off from GFP2 during the adsorption process. Therefore,GFP2
is stabilized under the given environment.

After each sorption
experiment, iron concentration measured in solution is lower than
0.001 mmol L–1, which means that no dissolution
of the nanoparticles occurs during the immersion of these microbeads
in solution. Overall, GFP2 can be directly used for the treatment
of natural waters polluted by Pb2+ (Cd2+).

Desorption and Recycling Research studies
Recycling performance
of the adsorbent, which could make the price
of environmental remediation, is a key factor for their large-scale
application. To research Pb2+ (Cd2+) recycling
usage and desorption of GFP2, EDTA (2.0 mol/L) is used for the elution
of adsorbed Pb2+ (Cd2+) onto GFP2 in the experiment.
The adsorption–desorption cycle data are displayed in Figure S5. It shows that the adsorption capacities
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ after five cycles decreased
by approximately 6.4 and 11.6%, respectively, which may be attributed
to the deactivation of adsorption centers during the desorption process.
Overall, the experimental results indicate that GFP2 is an excellent
candidate in heavy metal-contaminated water remediation.

Conclusions
In the text, mesoporous
layered magnetic hybrid GFP2 composed of GO, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs), and C3N3S3 polymers with a mesoporous layered “sandwich”
structure were successfully explored by an in situ simple polymerization
strategy for rapid removal of Pb2+ and Cd2+ from
water. The adsorbent (GFP2) shows high adsorption capacity (277.78
and 49.75 mg/g) and good selectivity for Pb2+ and Cd2+, respectively. Owing to its large BET surface area (123.8
m2/g) and mesoporous structure, it exhibits the fast adsorption
kinetics (>80% elimination efficiency within only 30 min). The
Langmuir isotherm model based on typical monomolecular layer adsorption
fits well with the adsorption data. The adsorption process of GFP2
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ can be explained well with
the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The adsorption capacities
for Pb2+ and Cd2+ after five cycles decreased
by approximately only 6.4 and 11.6%, respectively, indicating that
GFP2 is a kind of recyclable solid absorbent, which is an excellent
candidate in the heavy -metal wastewater treatment. More importantly,
GFP2 was set with Fe3O4NPs and it can be simply
separated from wastewater using an extra magnet (Figure S6). Obviously, GFP2 with a simple preparation method,
excellent recyclability, good selectivity for capturing Pb2+ and Cd2+, and stability has a good opportunity to be
applied in the heavy metal wastewater treatment in the future.

Experimental
Section
Preparation of GP
Graphite oxide
was prepared by chemical exfoliation of graphite powder based on a
modified Hummer’s method.57 The
specific procedure for the preparation of GP were as follows: first,
a certain amount of GO was dispersed in 300 mL of water by ultrasound,
named suspension A. Second, 0.04 mol NaOH was dissolved in 50 mL of
water and 0.02 mol Na3C3N3S3 monomer was dissolved in the alkaline solution by stirring to get
a bright yellow solution B. Then A and B were mixed together and stirred
vigorously for 0.5 h, named suspension C. Third, 0.03 mol iodine in
a concentrated aqueous solution of KI was dropped slowly into suspension
C at 0 °C under stirring and continued to stir for 12 h at room
temperature. The mixture color progressively changed from brown to
blue-gray, and then the precipitate was separated by centrifugation.
Next, the precipitate was washed with water for five times and dried
at 50 °C. The same method
was used to prepare composites P, GP1, GP2, and GP3 with GO using
0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g, respectively.

Preparation of GFP (Scheme 1)
A modified
Massart method58 was used to prepare magnetite
Fe3O4NPs (8–12
nm). The process is as follows: first, 0.5 g of GO was dispersed in
300 mL of water by ultrasound, named suspension A. Second, 0.04 mol
NaOH was dissolved in 50 mL of water and 0.02 mol Na3C3N3S3 monomer was dissolved in alkaline
solution by stirring to get a bright yellow solution B. Then A and
B were mixed together and stirred vigorously for 0.5 h, named suspension
C. Third, a certain amount of Fe3O4NPs was dispersed
in 150 mL of 0.01 mol/L nitric acid solution by using an ultrasonic
cleaner, and recover them by a magnetic field. Subsequently, the Fe3O4NPs were redispersed in 150 mL of water, named
suspension D. Fourth, suspension D was added into suspension C slowly
under mechanical stirring, then countinued stirring for 0.5 h. Finally,
0.03 mol iodine in a concentrated aqueous solution of KI was dropped
slowly into the above suspension at 0 °C under stirring, and
continued to stir for 12 h at room temperature. The mixture color
progressively changed from brown to black, and then the precipitate
was separated by a magnet. Then the precipitate was washed with water
several times and was dried at 50 °C. The same method was
used to prepare composites GFP1, GFP2, and GFP3 with Fe3O4NPs using 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 g, respectively (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of GFP
Adsorption Experiments
In the
adsorption experiments, Pb(NO3)2 and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O were used to research the
adsorption properties. The adsorption isotherm experiment for the
GP (GP1, GP2, and GP3) and GFP (GFP1, GFP2, and GFP3) adsorbents is
carried out in a typical process: the adsorbents (0.03 g) were added
into 30 mL of heavy metal salt solution (in range of 25–500
mg/L) in a plastic tube. Then they were vibrated at 200 rpm for 12
h on a constant temperature shaking bed. The residual Pb2+ (Cd2+) concentration in adsorption liquid was determined
with inductively coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometry
(Optima8000, PerkinElmer). Three replicates were set for each sample,
and the mean values were used to measure the absorption characteristics.
The adsorption capacity (qe) and elimination
efficiency (E %) of Pb2+ (or Cd2+) were determined using formulas 6 and 7, respectively.59,60 6   7  where Ce
and C0 are the equilibrium and initial
concentrations of Pb2+ (or Cd2+) (mg/L) in the
aqueous solution, individually; m is the dry-weight
of the adsorbent (g), qe is the weight
of the adsorbate adsorbed per unit dry mass of the adsorbent (mg/g)
and V is the solution volume (L). The experiments
of adsorption kinetics and environmental effect factors were carried
out using 30 mg of adsorbent in 30 mL of Pb2+ (or Cd2+) solution (100 mg L–1).
