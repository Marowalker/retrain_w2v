Phototoxicity response of synthesized vitamin–chlorin
conjugates
and their zinc and indium complexes was determined in the human PC-3
prostate cancer cell line, which was previously demonstrated to overexpress
vitamin receptors on the cell surface. Pantothenic acid (Vit B5) and
lipoic acid (or thioctic acid) were covalently linked to methyl pheophorbide
(a chlorophyll derivative) and subsequently metallated with zinc and
indium. Cell survival assay indicated that the vitamin–chlorin
conjugates have better photodynamic activity against the PC-3 prostate
cancer line at the nanomolar concentration range than the commercially
available starting precursor methyl pheophorbide. Fluorescence and
transmission electron microscopy studies indicated some formation
of apoptotic cells and cytoplasmic vacuoles of photosensitized prostatic
cells. Targeting vitamin receptors in prostatic cancer cells can be
utilized to enhance specificity of photosensitizers for photodynamic
therapy applications.

Introduction
Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading
cause of cancer deaths
in men next to lung cancer, and accounts for 20% of estimated new
cases in the US in 2019.1 Current treatments
for early-stage and advanced PC include radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy
(radioactive seed implants), hormone (medical castration or androgen
deprivation), cryosurgery, vaccination, and chemotherapy. These treatments
can cause mild to severe side effects, complications, and fatal adverse
reactions which include menopausal-like symptoms (hot flashes, night
sweats and loss of libido), irritability, headache, fatigue, nausea,
back pain, osteoporosis, scarring, urinary incontinence, erectile
dysfunction, infection, risk of diabetes, obesity, renal failure,
and stroke.2 For less aggressive prostatic
tumors especially for older men, active surveillance rather than immediate
treatment is the recommended approach.3

Focal therapy (FT) is now an emerging treatment for localized
PC.4 Some FTs including high-intensity
focused ultrasound,
cryotherapy, and radiofrequency have been used for patients with low-risk
and localized PC. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered an FT which
aims to reduce morbidity associated with radical surgery and radiotherapy,
while maintaining oncologic control.5 PDT
is a minimally invasive treatment for cancer of the esophagus, bronchi,
gastric, cervix, skin, head, and neck.6,7 PDT treatment
includes delivery of a fluorophore, known as a photosensitizer (PS),
to tumor tissues upon systemic administration and irradiation with
harmless visible light (600–800 nm) in the presence of endogenous
oxygen. Excitation of PS with light in the red or near infrared (NIR)
region generates cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), including
singlet oxygen (1O2) causing irreversible damage
to tumor cells. PDT for low-risk localized PC can be considered a
safe and effective treatment and a tissue-preserving option for men
to prevent radical therapy.

From 2002 to 2017, several studies
indicated the application of
transrectal or abdominal ultrasound-guided PDT for PC. PSs used for
PDT consisted of temeporfin,8,9 5-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA),10 motexafin lutetium,11 and padaporfin.12 The Gleason score of PC ranged from 6 (3 + 3) to 9 (4 + 5), while
the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) prior to PDT ranged from 3.3 to
22.4 ng/mL. Results from a randomized clinical trial indicated that
55% of the patients considered having low-risk localized PC in the
study showed negative biopsy post-PDT with a Gleason score of less
than 6, and 35% showed a decreased PSA level (<4.0 ng/mL).13 Compared to cryotherapy, brachytherapy, and
high-intensity focused ultrasound, PDT for PC seems to show a low
rate of side effects.14 Serious adverse
side-effects consisted of hematuria, erectile dysfunction, dysuria,
prostatic pain, urinary tract infection, and urinary retention being
the most common. Even though these studies have demonstrated the efficacy
of PDT for PC,15 this treatment approved
30 years ago remains underutilized in clinical practice and has not
received wide acceptance because of necrosis of the entire prostate
during clinical trials accompanied by severe inflammation causing
extreme pain to the patient as a result of nonselective tissue targeting
of the FDA-approved PSs (Photofrin and Foscan).16,17

Ideal PSs are typically characterized by high selectivity
for tumor
over normal tissues, a high quantum yield of light-induced triplet
state oxygen formation, low dark toxicity, and rapid clearance from
the body.18,19 The major drawback for the widespread application
of PDT in the clinics is mainly due to PS selectivity, and must be
improved to optimize anticancer treatment with reduced toxicity.20,21

Cancer treatment utilizing ligands for selective targeted
delivery
of pharmaceuticals to malignant cells can improve anticancer drugs
for treatment and imaging.22,23 Drug conjugates or
hybrid ligands represent a promising class of anticancer agents to
overcome treatment failures because of nonspecific tissue targeting,
drug toxicity, and development of resistance.24 To maintain a high proliferative status, cancer cells demand a variety
of nutrient transporters. Utilizing these influx transporters to deliver
anticancer drugs into the cells via a transporter-mediated cellular
accumulation pathway offers a promising mechanistic route. A sodium-dependent
multivitamin transporter (SMVT) translocates biotin (BTN; Vit B7),
as well as lipoic acid (LA; coenzyme), pantothenic acid (PA; Vit B5),
and desthiobiotin (BTN structural analogue) across biological membranes.25 This transport system, which is upregulated
and amplified in malignant tissues as a means to compete with normal
healthy cells for survival and propagation, has been utilized for
delivering drugs to target cancer cells. Previous studies revealed
that the conjugation of BTN to acyclovir, ganciclovir, camptothecin,
and doxorubicin caused a significant increase in the accumulation
of drug into tumor cells compared to unmodified drug without BTN conjugation.26−28

Several PSs developed for prostate PDT treatment are based
on chlorophyll a derivatives or chlorins, which have
been shown to exhibit
low dark toxicity and generate singlet oxygen species upon light activation.29,30 In the present study, the synthesis of new vitamin–chlorin
conjugates including their corresponding zinc(II) and indium(III)
metal complexes and evaluation of their photodynamic activity against
the human PC-3 PC cell line are described. The PC-3 PC cell line was
observed to overexpress vitamin receptors by other investigators.26 New chlorin derivatives conjugated to PA and
LA will aim to target vitamin receptors overexpressed in PC cells.
This research will provide an opportunity to improve PSs for PDT for
cancer by exploiting the vitamin–receptor transport system
in order to enhance the advancement of cancer research and treatment.

Results and Discussion
Chemistry
As a continuation of our effort to evaluate
the photodynamic cellular activity of vitamin–chlorin conjugates
for their potential application in cancer research, a series of PSs
composed of methyl pheophorbide a derivatives linked
to vitamins or vitamin analogues have been prepared in our research
group. Methyl pheophorbide a (1), a
commercially available starting material, was conjugated to LA and
PA using a hexyl diamine linker to produce the target chlorin derivatives
(5 and 8) in good yield, using a published
peptide coupling procedure.31 The corresponding
zinc and indium complexes (6–7 and 9–10) were also prepared following established metallation protocols.
Synthesized PSs as illustrated in Scheme 1 were purified by preparative silica gel
thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plate and the molecular structures
were characterized by 1H-, 13C-, COSY, HSQC
NMR, and mass spectrometry spectral data.

Chlorin Derivatives
Reaction conditions:
(i) H2N(CH2)6NHBoc, CH2Cl2; (ii) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA); (iii) LA, DMTMM;
(iv) PA, EDC,
HBTU, DIPEA, and DMF.

Figure 1 shows the
UV–vis absorption spectra of the target chlorin–lipoic
acid (CLA, 5) and chlorin–pantothenic acid (CPA, 8) conjugates including their zinc (6 and 9) and indium (7 and 10) complexes.
Typical red shift of the Soret band and blue shift of the fourth Q
band were observed upon metalation.32,33 Characteristic 1H NMR peaks for CPA are the presence of 2 unique methyl groups
attached to a quaternary carbon at 0.542 and 0.506 ppm, which were
observed to shift upfield with a difference, Δδ, of 0.8
ppm in the zinc complex. Additionally, zinc complexes (ZnCLA and ZnCPA)
showed considerable broadening of 1H NMR signals primarily
because of stacking interaction of the chlorin macrocyclic ring.

Conjugation of the PS to the vitamins involved
in the linkage of
a hexyl six-carbon spacer arm, which provides the length between the
macrocyclic chlorin ring and the vitamin ligand for enhanced binding
ability to the vitamin receptors expressed over the cancer cell surface.34 Other vitamin–chlorin conjugates previously
synthesized in our laboratory including chlorin–biotin (CBTN)
and chlorin–bexarotene (CBX) with their zinc and indium metallated
counterparts, as shown in Scheme 2, were previously synthesized and tested in vitro against
mouse colon cancer, triple-negative breast, and triple-positive breast
cancer cell lines. Results are already published elsewhere.35,36 The vitamins (BTN and PA), coenzyme LA, and bexarotene (BX; Vit
A analogue) were covalently appended to the 131 position
of the chlorin macrocycle via a hexyl diamine linker.

Cellular Biological Activity of Vitamins in the PC-3 PC Cell
Line
Vitamins are generally characterized as poorly immunogenic,
cost-effective, and for some can be chemically modified fairly easily.
These compounds are considered essential constituents in the proper
functioning of a mammalian organism. PA (Vit B5) is a water-soluble
vitamin which is a precursor for the synthesis of coenzyme A, an important
component in numerous biochemical reactions that sustain life. It
is ubiquitously found in foods of both plant and animal origin, and
dietary deficiency is a rare occurrence. LA, also present in almost
all foods, is abundant in spinach, broccoli, yeast extract, kidney,
heart, and liver. Its naturally occurring form is the R-enantiomer. LA, though closely associated with the vitamin B complexes,
is not considered a vitamin by most researchers now. Its biochemical
activity is linked with its function as a cofactor in several enzymatic
mechanisms, in particular, the citric acid cycle, including the enzymes
α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes
that both require the lipoyl group for acyl group transfer reactions.37 Aside from its role in metabolic as well as
cellular signaling pathways, the therapeutic potential of LA has been
extended to its neuroprotective properties in the hippocampal neurons
of mouse models of Alzheimer’s disease,38 to its reduction of serum glucose levels in diabetic rabbits,39 and to its capability to provoke cellular apoptosis
in lung cancer cells.40,41 BTN (Vit B7), a water-soluble
micronutrient, plays an essential role in a wide array of metabolic
processes in humans related to the consumption of fats, carbohydrates,
and amino acids, and, thus, is needed in normal mammalian cell growth,
function, and development. Intracellularly, the vast majority of BTN
is found to localize in mitochondria and the cytoplasm which is consistent
with its role as a coenzyme for carboxylases in these cellular compartments.
Additionally, BTN is also abundant in the cell nucleus because of
its propensity to biotinylate via amide linkage lysine residues of
histones in the maintenance of gene expression and DNA repair to promote
genomic stability during cell proliferation.42 BX is a Vit A analogue classified as a rexinoid and widely used
for treating visual and dermatological diseases, and their effect
on cancer treatment and prevention has attracted attention.43,44 Vit A mimics are indicated to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation,
and apoptosis.45,46 BX (Targretin) is a selective
modulator of retinoid X receptors (RXRs) and approved for treating
advanced-stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Several preclinical studies
and phase I/II clinical trials showed that BX exhibits tumor prevention
activity against breast cancer, renal carcinoma, and lung cancer.47,48

Vitamins such as BTN and PA, and the coenzyme LA are internalized
by receptor-mediated endocytosis, and demonstrated to be uptaken by
human PC-3 prostatic cells via a specialized carrier-mediated transport
system.26 The PC-3 cell line is a widely
used in vitro cell culture model for PC derived from prostatic adenocarcinoma
metastasized to the bone. Human PC-3 cell line has very aggressive
characteristics and represents 90% of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Other
PC cell lines such as LNCaP and DU-145, which are less aggressive
types, have been used as in vitro models.49,50 BTN and LA are shown to be taken up by the cells in almost equal
amounts, but PA is internalized into the cells and 23% less than BTN
and LA.26Figure 2 shows the biological activity of PC-3 cells
after 24 h treatment with vitamins without light exposure and with
a light irradiation of 4.8 J cm–2 which is the highest
intensity used in this study. PA is observed to promote cellular proliferation
by about 26% in the dark. No cellular damage was apparent upon treatment
with vitamins alone, except for a 15% decreased cell survival for
BX-treated cells in the dark and a slight decrease of 8% cell survival
upon 5 min light irradiation. This is due to the fact that BX alone
has anticancer properties.

human PC-3 PC cell
line (A) after 24 h treatment with BTN, BX, LA, and PA in the dark;
and then (B) after 5 min 650 nm light exposure (power of 16 mW/cm2 and fluence rate of 4.8 J/cm2).

Photodynamic Activity of Vitamin–Chlorin Conjugates in
the PC-3 PC Cell Line
Selective localization of chlorins51 into tumor cells is primarily due to decreased
pH of cancerous tissues,52 enhanced penetration
of tumor vasculature impairing blood supply to the area,53,54 presence of heme carrier protein,55 overexpression
of low-density lipoprotein (LDL; apoB/E) receptors,56 impaired lymphatic drainage or the enhanced permeability
and retention (EPR) effect,57 and large
amounts of collagen.58 Mitochondrial accumulation
of chlorophyll derivatives is also believed to be mediated by the
peripheral benzodiazepine receptor, now referred to as the translocator
protein (TSPO), usually located in the outer mitochondrial membrane
and characterized by its ability to bind a variety of benzodiazepine-like
drugs and the tetrapyrrole intermediates of the heme biosynthetic
pathway.59,60 TSPO ligands can then be useful as anti-cancer
agents because it has been observed that increased TSPO expression
is associated with an advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in human
astrocytoma, colorectal, and breast cancers.61 Conjugating a vitamin ligand to chlorins targeting the vitamin receptors
also upregulated on the cancer cell surface will provide additional
enhancement of PS internalization into tumor cells.

Free-Base Vitamin–Chlorin Conjugates
The unmetallated
vitamin–chlorin conjugates including the starting precursor
methyl pheophorbide 1 caused no dark cytotoxicity against
PC-3 PC cells, except for CPA which showed 25% dark toxicity at a
higher concentration of 10 μM as shown in Figure 3. Findings in this study indicated that three
of the vitamin–chlorin conjugates (CBTN, CLA, and CPA) showed
better photocytotoxicity than the starting methyl pheophorbide a.
CPA caused the most phototoxicity by about 31% reduction in cell proliferation
at 200 nM and lowest light dose (0.96 J/cm2 fluence rate)
compared to MePheo 1. The order of phototoxicity against
PC-3 prostatic cells in this study is CPA > CBTN > CLA >
MePheo >
CBX. CPA has hydrophilic PA with primary and secondary hydroxyl groups
providing the desired amphiphilic components for enhanced tumor localization
and better photodynamic effect more than BTN and LA. The presence
of the Vit A analogue BX in the vitamin–chlorin conjugate CBX
did not generate enhanced internal accumulation of the PS in the cells
for better photodynamic activity, due to the greater hydrophobic nature
of its molecular architecture decreasing amphiphilicity as a necessary
parameter for PS cellular internalization. DMSO, used as the vehicle
to dissolve the PSs, caused no cell damage at the concentration used
corresponding to ≤0.08% (see Figure 3).

PC cells treated with
unmetallated chlorin–vitamin conjugates and their corresponding
indium complexes. (A) After 24 h treatment with 200 nM to 10 μM
PSs (MePheo 1, CBTN 11, InCBTN-Cl 13, CBX 14, InCBX-Cl 16, CLA 5, InCLA-Cl 7, CPA 8, and InCPA-Cl 10), with no light irradiation; and (B) after 24 h treatment
with 100 nM to 5 μM PSs followed by 1 min 650 nm light exposure
(power of 16 mW/cm2 and fluence rate of 0.96 J/cm2). Vehicle used is dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; at ≤0.08%).

Metallated Vitamin–Chlorin Conjugates
Previous
studies demonstrated that metal coordination with zinc62,63 and indium64,65 to chlorins enhances in vitro
oxidative cell damage and greater singlet oxygen production, respectively.
Thus, the corresponding zinc and indium complexes of the chlorin–vitamin
conjugates were also prepared using published metallation protocols.32,65

From the results of the cell viability assay as shown in Figure 3B, only InCLA exhibited
the highest dark cytotoxicity, while InCBX has dark toxicity only
at a higher concentration of 10 μM. Upon cellular photosensitization,
InCLA also caused the most cytotoxicity, and the photocytotoxicity
order for the indium complexes is InCLA > InCBX ≫ InCPA
≫>
InCBTN. From this trend and based on the molecular nature of the vitamin
appended, PA appears to inhibit the photodynamic efficacy of InCPA,
possibly due to an interaction of the hydroxyl groups with indium.
The presence of a carbonyl functionality in BTN could also cause an
intermolecular indium–carbonyl interaction also affecting the
ability of indium in increasing singlet oxygen production upon photosensitization.
Because BX only contains nonpolar molecular functionality, no intermolecular
interaction with indium can be expected, and thus, the phototoxic
behavior of InCBX is next to InCLA, wherein the disulfide entity in
LA did not block the photodynamic effect of indium probably because
of the cyclic nature of the disulfide linkage in the lipoate moiety
which might be too bulky and sterically constrained to interact with
indium.

For the zinc complexes in Figure 4A–D, the photodynamic activity in
PC-3 cells
is similar to the free-base vitamin–chlorin conjugates. There
is a slight 22% dark cytotoxicity at 10 μM of ZnCPA, while the
rest of the zinc complexes exhibited no cell inhibition in the dark.
The trend ZnCLA ≥ ZnCPA > ZnCBTN ≫> ZnCBX seems
to be
comparable with that of the unmetallated complexes indicating that
zinc metal has a minor effect in improving the phototodynamic nature
of the vitamin–chlorin conjugates by increasing its in vitro
oxidative cell damage. Additionally, the zinc complexes are observed
to undergo a stacking interaction of the chlorin macrocyclic ring
as manifested by the broadening of the proton NMR signals. Increased
lipophilicity of the zinc complex in other studies resulted in a higher
vesicle and cellular uptake allowing for more efficient membrane photo-oxidation.60 However, significant photodynamic enhancement
with zinc chelation to chlorin was not observed in this study.

the cell survival assay of PC-3 PC cells treated with
zinc complexes of chlorin–vitamin conjugates. After 24 h treatment
with 1–10 μM PSs (ZnCBTN 12, ZnCBX 15, ZnCLA 6, and ZnCPA 9), with
no light irradiation (A); and, followed by 1 (B), 2 (C), and 5 min
(D) 650 nm light exposure (power of 16 mW/cm2 and fluence
rate of 0.96, 1.92, and 4.8 J/cm2, respectively).

Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy
PDT can lead to
various forms of cell death pathways, either apoptosis, necrosis and/or
autophagy. Apoptosis,66 referred to as
programmed cell death pathway, is a complex multistep highly controlled
process characterized by several biochemical and morphological changes
associated with the demise of a living cell. It is the preferred cell
death mechanism because of the absence of inflammation causing less
pain to the patients compared to necrosis (accidental and unprogrammed
cell death mechanism characterized by acute tissue injury, cytoplasmic
cell swelling, and disintegration of cellular membranes), or autophagy
(autodegradation characterized by the presence of vesicles and double-membrane
structures called autophagosomes surrounding the target region).50 Recently, paraptosis, which is a term to describe
extensive single-membrane bounded vacuole formation because of misfolded
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, has been implicated as a response
to PDT damage.67 Morphological examination
using fluorescence microscopy has provided detailed structural features
characterizing apoptotic cell death which are mainly cell shrinkage,
rounding, membrane blebbing, and apoptotic bodies. DNA fragmentation
has been observed to be present in both apoptotic and necrotic cells
and, therefore, is not an entirely definitive indication to unambiguously
identify apoptosis alone. PDT response is dependent on the cell type,
types of PSs utilized, subcellular localization of the PS, and light
dose for activation. It is now accepted that a high PS concentration
or high fluence rate of light introduced typically will cause necrotic
cell death, while the administration of low doses of PS and light
predispose tumor cells to undergo apoptosis.66 However, PDT has the ability to activate multiple cell death pathways.68 Results in our study from fluorescence light
microscopy experiments revealed only cell shrinkage and rounding,
but the presence of apoptotic bodies, nuclear margination, and DNA
fragmentation were not evident to a large extent. At 500 nM concentration
and a light dose of 1.92 J/cm2, only CBX-sensitized PC-3
cells indicated a few apoptotic cells (Figure 5F). Significant reduction of cell density
after photosensitization was apparent for the unmetallated vitamin–chlorin
conjugates CBTN, CLA, and CPA as compared to precursor MePheo as shown
in Figure 5D,H,J,L,
and this observation is consistent with the cell survival assay depicted
in Figure 3 in which
CPA, CBTN, and CLA (at 500 nM and 0.96 J/cm2) reduced cell
survival by about 58, 50, and 30%, respectively, more than precursor
MePheo.

of 16 mW/cm2 and fluence rate of 1.92 J/cm2).
Shrunk cells and sparse cell density (D,F,J,H,L) are observed without
significant apoptosis characterized by nuclear fragmentation, except
for a few in CBX-treated cells (F). Insets are enlarged views.

For the In complexes at 500 nM concentration and
a light dose of
1.92 J/cm2, InCBTN and InCBX showed intact cells with very
little cellular damage (Figure 6A,B). InCLA revealed evidence of apoptosis with the appearance
of chromatin fragments and reduction of cell density (Figure 6C), while the InCPA indicated
combination of necrosis due to cell swelling and apoptosis due to
some nuclear condensation (Figure 6D). Fluorescence microscopy results matched the cell
viability assay data shown in Figure 3B in which InCLA exhibited the most phototoxic effect.
For the zinc complexes at the same concentration and light dose, only
intact cells were observed (Figure 6F–H) consistent with the results from the cell
proliferation assay in which cell damage was apparent starting at
the micromolar range (5 μM). For PC-3 cells treated with vitamins
alone and photo-irradiated, no cellular damage was detected (Figure 5M–P), and,
in fact, vitamins promoted cell growth.

fixed human PC-3 PC cells after 24 h treatment

and reduced cell density (D,F,H) are observed without substantial
apoptosis except for InCLA (C) showing few chromatin fragments. Insets
are enlarged views.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed
ultrastructural
images of PC-3 cells before and after treatment with PS and light. Figure 7A,B shows images
of control cells with round and well-preserved cytoplasm and plasma
membrane. Similarly, when cells (Figure 7C) were treated with 500 nM CLA in the dark,
a large nucleolus and well-defined plasma membrane with the cell adhering
to its neighbor is observed. Upon 24 h treatment with CLA and after
photosensitization with 1.92 J/cm2, cells as shown in Figure 7D–F started
to retract, and degeneration of nuclear and cytoplasmic structures,
ruffling, blebbing, budding, and vacuole formation were indicative
of cellular injury caused by irradiation. Degradation of intracellular
components as a response to insults seem to be taking place in discrete
steps including sequestration of cytoplasmic structures. Aside from
the appearance of shrunk and irregularly shaped cells, a striking
feature in Figure 7F is the formation of vacuoles which can be described as an example
of autophagic vesicles whereby the intracellular components are completely
unrecognizable with the cell compartments enclosed into a somewhat
thicker or perhaps a double-membrane structure characteristic of autophagosomes.
From the TEM results, CLA-induced photosensitization appears to promote
autophagy as one of its mechanistic route for cellular degradation.

of human PC-3 PC cells showing untreated unirradiated
control samples (A,B) with the cytoplasm containing a number of functional
organelles. After 24 h treatment with 500 nM of CLA in the dark (C),
cells still showed preserved nucleolus and plasma membrane. CLA-treated
cells followed by 2 min 650 nm light (power of 16 mW/cm2 and fluence rate of 1.92 J/cm2) exposure (D–F)
indicated that the nuclear structure started to collapse with apparent
extracellular debris (D), blebbing along the periphery (E), and appearance
of cytoplasmic vacuoles (E,F).

Conclusions
Vitamin transporters upregulated in cancer
cells are targets for
improving cellular accumulation of poorly permeable highly potent
anticancer drugs including the delivery of PSs for PDT applications.
Findings in our study demonstrated that BTN, LA, and PA in the vitamin–chlorin
conjugates provided a means for increased photodynamic activity at
the nanomolar range to disrupt cancer cell proliferation of human
PC-3 prostatic cells. The presence of indium provided additional PDT
efficacy in vitro compared to the unmetallated chlorin–vitamin
conjugate and the zinc complexes. BX, a Vit A analogue, did not enhance
photodynamic activity of the synthesized PS in the PC-3 PC cell line.
Further research is required to determine if the vitamin-conjugated
PSs synthesized in this study will provide selectivity in vivo to
internalize PSs in specific types of cancer that exhibit overexpression
of vitamin receptors including ovarian, breast, renal, lung, and leukemia
cell lines. PDT is slowly being used as a viable option in the treatment
of cancer, specifically, the aggressive type. More work is needed
to create PSs that would be more specific to the tumor, thereby inhibiting
toxicity to normal healthy cells.

Experimental Section
Chemical Synthesis
General
Solvents and reagents were purchased mainly
from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co. (St. Louis MO, USA). All air and moisture
sensitive reactions were performed in anhydrous solvents under a nitrogen
atmosphere. Chromatographic purifications were performed in the normal
phase preparative TLC plate (Analtech). Reactions were monitored spectrophotometrically
or by TLC using a polyester-backed normal phase analytical plate (Merck,
Silica gel 60 F254 precoated 200 μm) and detected
with UV light (λ = 254 nm). Visible spectra were recorded with
a ThermoScientific Genesys 150 UV–visible spectrophotometer.
NMR spectra were acquired with a Bruker AVANCE NMR spectrometer (400
MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C). Chemical shifts
are reported in δ ppm referenced according to the deuterated
solvent used as the internal standard: CDCl3 7.24 ppm (1H), 77.23 ppm (13C). High-resolution mass spectroscopy
(HRMS) data were obtained on a Bruker microTOF-II ESI mass spectrometer.
All compounds synthesized were isolated and purified in ≥94%
purity as confirmed by 1H, 13C, 2D COSY (correlated
spectroscopy), DEPT 90/135 (distortion-less enhancement by polarization
transfer), HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) NMR spectra.
Sample purity was also checked using ThermoScientific Ultimate 3000
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) equipped with a diode-array
four channel variable UV–visible detector, an autosampler,
and a fraction collector using a reverse-phase column (C-18, 4.6 ×
50 mm2, 3.5 μm) in the isocratic mobile phase (100%
acetonitrile or 100% methanol) visualizing at λ = 405 and 665
nm with a flow rate of 1 mL min–1.

Synthesis of 131 Hexamethylenediaminyl-lipoylchlorin
e6 Dimethyl Ester, CLA, 5
In a dry
round-bottom flask containing a mixture of 131 hexamethylenediaminylchlorin
e6 DME 2 (40 mg, 0.055 mmol), LA 3 (30 mg, 0.15 mmol), and 4-(4,6-dimethoxy-1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)-4-methylmorpholinium
chloride (DMTMM, 40 mg, 0.145 mmol) was stirred in dry CH2Cl2 (8 mL) under nitrogen overnight for 12 h. The reaction
was monitored by TLC (5% methanol in CH2Cl2)
until the reaction showed disappearance of the starting amine. The

Photocytotoxicity Assay
General
The human PC-3 PC cell line was purchased from
the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC CRL-1435). PC-3 cells were
cultured in F-12 medium (ATCC 30-2006) supplemented with 10% fetal
bovine serum and were grown to 80–90% confluence in 75 cm2 culture flasks (Corning) for about a week (5–6 days)
in a humidified incubator (Fisher Scientific Isotemp) with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Culturing and subculturing procedures were
followed according to the ATCC Protocol available online for the PC-3
PC cell line.69

Cell Survival Assay
Cells were grown to confluence
in a 96-well plate (4 × 104 cells/well) and treated
for 24 h with compounds or PSs (0.02, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10 μM)
in growth media from a stock solution of 10 mM in DMSO (Fisher). After
24 h treatment, cells were gently replaced with fresh media and positioned
below a noncoherent LumaCare LC-122650 nm light source and subsequently
irradiated for 1, 2, and 5 min at an energy fluence rate of 16 mW/cm2 (measured using a Newport optical power meter model 840).
Untreated cells served as control samples. Cells were gently washed
with prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the next day, and MTT
(3-[4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl]-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide, Sigma,
0.3 mg/mL) in PBS was added to each well. Samples were incubated for
2 h. DMSO was added to each well and plates were shaken at room temperature
for 1 h to dissolve the purplish-blue formazan crystals. Absorbance
values at 490 nm were measured on a microplate reader (BioRad 550).
Absorbance readings were calculated based on the absorbance of the
untreated cells alone (as control) and were directly proportional
to the number of viable cells in culture. Triplicate measurements
were done.

Fluorescence Microscopy
Cells (1 mL aliquots) obtained
from a diluted cell suspension were seeded into each well (1.7 cm2, ∼1000 cells/well) of a 4-well culture slide (BD Biosciences)
and grown to confluence in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After
aspirating the old media, 1 mL of the compound or PS (0.5 μM)
in fresh prewarmed media at 37 °C was added to each well. After
PS treatment for 24 h, cells were washed with 1 mL fresh growth media,
and then irradiated with light using LumaCare LC-122 as described
above. Cells were stained in the dark with 1 mL of 0.1 mg/mL Hoechst
33258 (Molecular Probes) in prewarmed media for 15 min at 37 °C,
washed twice with 1 mL filtered PBS, then fixed with 1 mL filtered
prewarmed 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min in the incubator. Wells were
removed after liquid aspiration and slides were allowed to air dry
in the dark for 1 h. Slides were then protected with coverslips, sealed
with nail polish, and allowed to dry in the dark for another 30 min.
Images were recorded by fluorescence microscopy [4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole
(DAPI) for Hoechst 350–390 nm excitation and 460–490
nm emission filters] using an upright fluorescence microscope with
a Retiga imaging 2000R (Nikon Optiphot-2, 20× and 40×) and
image processing Nikon NIS-Elements V4.0 Qimaging software.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
PC-3 prostatic cells
were cultured to confluence in a Petri dish (50 cm in diameter), treated
for 24 h with 500 nM of PS, and then irradiated for 2 min as above.
After photosensitization 24 h later, cells were scraped gently in
the dark, fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate
buffer, then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (containing 0.8% ferricyanide),
treated with 2% aqueous uranyl acetate, and subsequently dehydrated
in gradient concentrations (50–100%) of varying ethanol/water
mixtures. The resulting pellets were embedded in resin and consequently
cut with an ultramicrotome to a 70 nm thickness, and then viewed using
a Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope.
