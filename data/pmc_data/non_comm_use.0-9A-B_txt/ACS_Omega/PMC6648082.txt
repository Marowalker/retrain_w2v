The proposed continuous folding structure
units are fundamental
to analyze protein structure. Here, we could elucidate for the first
time two types of hydrophobic core networks in apomyoglobin using
continuous folding structure units. In myoglobin, two autonomous sequences
emerged clearly. We could thus characterize the autonomous sequences
using well-defined hydrophobic core networks within respective semifolds.
A hydrophobic core is defined as a pair of topology-local hydrophobic
amino acids in different folding structures. Hydrophobic core formation
is indispensable to stabilize the different folding structures via
an efficient hydrophobic interaction. Autonomous sequences in myoglobin
encode tertiary structure information for semifolds. These sequences
fold autonomously into small sets of continuous folding structure
units to grow separate semifolds on each separate framework. The autonomous
sequence can be defined as the local sequence assigned to the small
set of continuous folding structure units. They create the discrete
hydrophobic region in a semifold by assembly of their hydrophobic
regions. Semifolds were characterized by discrete hydrophobic regions
stabilized by respective type I hydrophobic core networks, which were
present within each semifold. The discrete hydrophobic region of a
semifold propagated itself with that of a different semifold by hydrophobic
interactions in type II hydrophobic core network, which was present
between different semifolds, as observed by the X-ray structures of
semifolds. The most significant feature of semifolds in apomyoglobin
was that they could be verified by the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin
regardless of the instability of folds characteristic to autonomous
sequence fragments. This work presents the first description of autonomous
sequences.

1 Introduction
Protein-folding
information is axiomatically encoded in the amino
acid sequence of proteins.1−6 It can be elucidated by analyzing the structure of well-established
proteins as a structural analysis based on normalized structure information
requires experimental evidence. Levinthal inferred that protein sequences
are folded into native structures via specific folding pathways as
there are too many possible conformations for determining native structures
by random searching.7,8 Originally, the tertiary structure
of a protein can be derived by simple accumulation of the conformation
of each amino acid, and the continuous secondary structures of the
protein are the entire framework of a protein fold.9 Thus, secondary structures were utilized as specific folding
pathways for protein-folding analysis.10−12 In general, 50–60%
of amino acids in globular proteins are in α-helix and/or β-strand
structures.13,14 However, amino acid sequences
have not been assigned secondary structure information, because many
types of secondary structures are still undefined.

To cover
all protein chains with defined-local structures, we introduced
protein-folding structures instead of secondary structures because
normalized secondary structure information could not be analyzed statistically.5 Folding structure units were defined by using
folding elements based on the observation of two-dimensional representations
of the dihedral angles of each amino acid and the amino acid sequences
of native protein structures.9,15 Each folding structure
unit was defined so that both the terminal di- and tripeptide sequences
shared common sequences with the two adjacent folding structure units.5 Thus, folding structures of protein folds are
composed of continuous folding structure units with suitable overlapping
regions. N-Terminal and C-terminal folding structures are always partial
structures of folding structure units. Folding structure units are
characterized by one-dimensional combinations of folding elements
assigned to each amino acid in local sequences. Statistical analysis
of folding structures instead of secondary structures led to a general
solution for the formation of normalized folding structures in proteins
based on the normalized folding structure information and probability
theory.5 Description of protein structure
in terms of folding structure units with suitable overlapping regions
enabled us to understand protein folding in well-established protein
structures at a residue-specific level.

Overlapping regions
determined the connection of folding structure
units, which were assigned to the amino acid sequence. Continuous
folding structure units covered the entire framework of a protein
fold.5 The entire framework of protein
fold was formed by simple accumulation of folding elements to each
amino acid in the protein sequence, based on the amino acid sequence
by means of probability theory using the normalized folding structure
information.5 Thus, protein folding was
considered to proceed by folding events mediated by hydrophobic interactions
throughout the entire framework. Protein folding on the entire framework
at the amino acid level distinctly differs from the specific pathway
model and the energy landscape and folding funnel model.4,6−8,10−12,16−23

Recently, Dyson and Wright reviewed the myoglobin folding
information,
delineating the folding pathway at a residue-specific level.6 The amino acid sequence of myoglobin can stabilize
apomyoglobin as well as discrete folded native-like intermediates,
referred to as “semifolds”. Apomyoglobin is the native
structure of myoglobin. At pH 6, apomyoglobin folds into the same
topology as holomyoglobin, except that the F helix is incompletely
folded.24 The semifold can be recognized
by using continuous folding structure units assigned to the myoglobin
sequence and is a minimum unit to analyze the tertiary structure information
of an autonomous sequence. Autonomous sequences of globular proteins
may certainly fold into semifolds. They separately fold into cooperative
native local structures based on their tertiary structure information,
even though fragment structures of protein chains are, in general,
predominantly nonnative.25,26 Given that autonomous
sequences are identified in a protein chain, protein-folding information
is clearly understood because it forms minimum tertiary structures
as semifolds.

The autonomous sequence corresponds to an autonomously
folding
peptide segment and creates the discrete hydrophobic region of a semifold
by assembly of hydrophobic regions in continuous folding structure
units. Thus, the small set of continuous folding structure units is
a defining characteristic to the autonomous sequence. We believe that
the semifold can be derived from the amino acid sequence by means
of probability theory using the normalized folding structure information.
We also propose the autonomous sequences of the well-established protein
structure fold into semifolds, which can be verified by X-ray structure
regardless of their instability. We consider that the identification
of autonomous sequences is the most important for understanding protein-folding
information.

Autonomous sequences in globular proteins have
not been recognized
because these fragment structures are, in general, nonnative.26 However, we noticed the existence of autonomous
sequences in the immunoglobulin-binding B1 domain of protein G (GB1).
The C-terminal 16-residue sequence is autonomous because the peptide
fragment G41–E56 can fold into a β-hairpin
in GB1,27,28 and the N-terminal 40-residue sequence is
also autonomous because the unstable fold of the M1–D40 peptide fragment can be stabilized by addition of the G41–E56 peptide fragment, forming a native-like
quaternary structure.28 These results imply
that the amino acid sequence of GB1 can be divided into an N-terminal
40-residue autonomous sequence (M1–D40) and a C-terminal 16-residue autonomous sequence (G41–E56) based on its X-ray structure,29 which showed that the autonomous sequences formed
native-like separate semifolds containing discrete hydrophobic regions.
Thus, the entire framework of GB1 is divided into separate frameworks
of semifolds. The X-ray structure of GB1 strongly supports that any
globular protein should have one or more autonomous sequences folding
into semifolds. However, no aggressive trial has been conducted to
determine the autonomous sequences from protein sequence.

Here,
to clarify and specify the autonomous sequences in any globular
protein, we conduct the identification of two autonomous sequences
in myoglobin and show that autonomous sequences in myoglobin can be
characterized for the first time using a defining set of the proposed
continuous folding structure units because myoglobin folding information
is most precisely investigated. We first dissect the entire framework
of apomyoglobin statistically by means of probability theory based
on the normalized folding structure information, using the X-ray structure
of holomyoglobin.30 Second, we reveal that
hydrophobic cores in apomyoglobin are dissected into two types of
hydrophobic core networks (type I and II) using the continuous folding
structure units. Third, we show that hydrophobic core networks decisively
characterize the autonomous sequences in myoglobin. Finally, we emphasize
that X-ray structures of semifolds formed by the autonomous sequences
can be confirmed experimentally regardless of the instability of folds
characteristic to the autonomous sequence fragments.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Dissection of the Entire
Framework of Apomyoglobin
Myoglobin folding proceeds along
the entire framework comprised
of continuous folding structure units. Apomyoglobin is the native
structure of myoglobin and can be dissected into continuous folding
structure units by referring to a two-dimensional representation of
the amino acid sequence in myoglobin and the dihedral angles of each
amino acid of holomyoglobin. The two-dimensional representation (sequence
vs dihedral angles) provided the relationship between the amino acid
sequence and continuous folding structure units. As a result, the
myoglobin sequence was annotated for corresponding folding structure
units. The normalized folding structure information provided relative
formation ability (RFA) values of local sequences for respective folding
structure units based on probability theory.

Figure 1 shows the sequential combinations
of folding elements assigned to each amino acid in local sequences
of myoglobin. Each of the folding structure units was assigned to
the myoglobin sequence based on the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin
using our proposed strategy.5 The continuous
folding structure units of holomyoglobin were as follows: NH3 (V1–S3) (RFA of local sequence = 1.9), H20
(L2–V21) (29) (A helix), H19 (A19–P37) (14) (B helix), H10 (S35–D44) (45) (C helix), H9 (K42–K50) (1.0) (C′ helix), HH3 (L49–T51) (1.6), H10 (K50–E59) (10) (D helix),
H24 (A57–G80) (6.1) (E helix), HH3 (K79–H81) (1.2), H20 (G80–I99) (3.0) (F helix), HH3 (K98–P100) (1.3), H22 (I99–P120) (35) (G helix),
T7 (R118–G124) (2.8) (α-turn),
H29 (F123–Y151) (380) (H helix), and
HC4 (G150–G153) (5.3). The N-terminal
and C-terminal folding structures are partial folding structure units.
The RFA of any local sequence for a folding structure is the product
of normalized formation probability (NFP) values of each amino acid
in the local sequence for respective folding elements,5 and describes the relative rate of formation of the folding
structure at the beginning of the folding process.

Figure 1 Folding structure units
in myoglobin.

Flexibility in the F
helix led HH3 (K79–H81), H20 (G80–I99), and HH3 (K98–P100) to HH22 (K79–P100) and would allow
insertion of the bulky heme.24 NH3 (V1–S3), HH3
(L49–T51), HH22 (K79–P100), and HC4 (G150–G153) in apomyoglobin
were N-terminal, interconnecting, and C-terminal folding structures,
respectively, and were disordered.5 Overlapping
sequences such as A19–V21 for two different
kinds of structure elements hii′ and a′ab in Figure 1 determine
the connection of folding structure units, which is a decisive feature
for the composition of the entire framework of apomyoglobin.

The overlapping regions observed in apomyoglobin were derived from
larger RFA values of local sequences for continuous folding structure
units except for respective local sequences around H9 (K42–K50) and HH22 (K79–P100). The overlapping regions derived from larger RFA values strongly
support that the entire framework of apomyoglobin is constructed at
the beginning of the folding process. The entire framework of apomyoglobin
was composed of continuous folding structure units, which were assigned
to the myoglobin sequence. The normalized continuous folding structure
units of apomyoglobin were formed statistically by simple accumulation
of folding elements encoded in each amino acid along respective local
sequences.

The exceptionally low RFA value (1.0) for H9 (K42–K50) strongly suggested that tertiary
interactions of folding
events were transferred from the D44 cap residue of H8
(F43–K50) to the F43 cap residue
of C′ helix. The RFA value for H8 (F43–K50) was 6.8. Another RFA value (0.41) for HH22 (K79–P100) was also lower (3.0) than that for H20 (G80–I99). These RFAs suggested instability
of the F helix. Thus, myoglobin folding proceeded along well-defined
folding events throughout the entire framework. The entire framework
of apomyoglobin comprised the normalized continuous folding structure
units assigned to the myoglobin sequence based on those observed in
holomyoglobin except for F helix (Figure 1).

2.2 Well-Defined Hydrophobic
Core Networks of
Apomyoglobin
Hydrophobic core formation throughout the entire
framework is undoubtedly the well-defined folding event of apomyoglobin.
This is the most intuitive understanding of the folding event for
apomyoglobin. The hydrophobic cores were defined as pairs of topology-local
hydrophobic amino acids, which were present in entirely different
folding structures and stabilized them via efficient hydrophobic interactions.
They always originated from different folding structure units. It
is the most important for the determination of hydrophobic cores to
differentiate those from simple hydrophobic contacts in identical
folding structures. The simple hydrophobic contacts were defined as
pairs of sequence-local hydrophobic amino acids in identical folding
structures in globular proteins. A folding structure unit is inherently
unstable regardless of the existence of pairs of hydrophobic amino
acids. Thus, continuous folding structure units in Figure 1 play a pivotal role in the
determination of hydrophobic cores in apomyoglobin. Hydrophobic amino
acids for hydrophobic core formation were taken based on X-ray structures
of proteins. They were as follows: A, C, F, I, L, M, P, V, W, and
Y.31−35

In actual fact, hydrophobic amino acids in different β-strand
folding structure units of the C-terminal 16-residue autonomous sequence
of GB1 form hydrophobic cores to stabilize a β-hairpin dramatically.27,28 However, simple hydrophobic contacts in an identical β-strand
folding structure cannot stabilize the β-strand folding structure
entirely in any globular protein because of the reduction of conformational
entropy.35 Here, we defined a hydrophobic
core of apomyoglobin using the distance between α-carbon coordinates
of hydrophobic amino acids. We determined 8.5 Å (1 Å = 0.1
nm) as the limit distance to form a stable hydrophobic core under
consideration of hydrophobic cores of GB1 fold and apomyoglobin. Hydrophobic
cores in GB1 fold and apomyoglobin strongly support that the limit
distance of 8.5 Å is adequate for GB1 and myoglobin sequences
to fold into GB1 fold and apomyoglobin, respectively. For example,
simple hydrophobic contacts below 8.5 Å of the distance between
α-carbon coordinates in identical folding structures of GB1
could be observed in the X-ray structure of GB15,29 and
were as follows: M1–Y3 (6.5), Y3–L5 (6.9), L5–L7 (6.3),
A23–A24 (3.8), A23–A26 (5.2), A24–A26 (5.5), A26–V29 (5.3), A26–F30 (6.2), V29–F30 (3.9), V29–Y33 (6.1), F30–Y33 (5.0), F30–A34 (6.0), Y33–A34 (3.9), W43–Y45 (7.0), F52–V54 (6.9). The numbers
in parentheses were the distances between α-carbon coordinates
in Å.

Given that the distance between α-carbon coordinates
of a
hydrophobic core was below 8.5 Å, the hydrophobic cores in apomyoglobin
were those shown in Figures 2 and 3. These figures show the hydrophobic
amino acids in myoglobin except for the region G80–I99, pairs of hydrophobic amino acids in hydrophobic cores,
and the distances in Å between the α-carbon coordinates
of the hydrophobic cores. The 63 hydrophobic cores in Figures 2 and 3 were clearly observed in the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin.30 Formation of nonlocal contacts reduces configurational
entropy in protein chains to promote protein folding.36 The hydrophobic zipper hypothesis was also proposed as
cooperativity in hydrophobic core formation.34 The hydrophobic core stabilized each folding structure remarkably
via hydrophobic interactions. However, simple hydrophobic contacts
in identical folding structures did not stabilize the folding structures.
The instability of simple hydrophobic contacts promotes protein folding
with adequate rapidity.37

Figure 2 Type I hydrophobic core
networks in myoglobin.

Figure 3 Type II hydrophobic core network in myoglobin.

The autonomous sequence in GB1 chain is a sequence corresponding
to an autonomously folding peptide segment, and the semifold is a
folding intermediate encoded by the autonomous sequence to create
a discrete hydrophobic region. Myoglobin sequence as well as GB1 sequence
revealed two discrete hydrophobic regions of semifolds, which were
assigned to two separate frameworks.29,30 Each of the
two separate frameworks of apomyoglobin was composed of a set of α-helix
folding structure units. The corresponding two autonomous sequences
of myoglobin could be characterized as autonomously folded peptide
segments that assigned those small sets of α-helix folding structure
units to the myoglobin sequence (Figure 1).

The 63 hydrophobic cores on the
entire framework produced two types
of hydrophobic core networks. The hydrophobic cores in apomyoglobin
were classified into type I hydrophobic core networks within respective
semifolds (blue and purple lines in Figure 2) and type II hydrophobic core network between
different semifolds (red lines in Figure 3) based on the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin
using continuous folding structure units in Figure 1. Autonomous sequences encoded the tertiary
structure information for semifolds and folded autonomously into semifolds
that created discrete hydrophobic regions.

The type I and type
II hydrophobic core networks of apomyoglobin
were formed based on the tertiary structure information of autonomous
sequences and that of myoglobin sequence, respectively.

Similarly,
the 25 hydrophobic cores of GB1 fold are observed in
the X-ray structure of GB1.29 The 25 hydrophobic
cores on the entire framework of GB1 fold produce two types of hydrophobic
core networks. Type I hydrophobic cores in GB1 fold were as follows:
M1–A20 (5.5), M1–V21 (6.1), Y3–A20 (7.3), Y3–A23 (7.8), Y3–A26 (6.8), L5–F30 (7.2), A7–A34 (8.4), L7–V39 (8.5), L12–V39 (7.5), A20–V21 (3.7), A20–A23 (7.3), A20–A26 (5.5), V21–A23 (7.3), V21–A26 (7.8), A34–V39 (5.1) W43–F52 (7.0), W43–V54 (4.5), Y45–F52 (4.4). The numbers in parentheses
were the distances between α-carbon coordinates (Å). Type
II hydrophobic cores in GB1 fold were as follows: Y3–F52 (7.6), L5–F52 (4.7), L5–V54 (7.6), L7–V54 (5.4), F30–F52 (8.4), A34–V54 (8.3), V39–V54 (8.1). The numbers in parentheses were the distances between α-carbon
coordinates (Å). GB1 sequence was divided into two autonomous
sequences, M1–E42 and G41–E56, based on the X-ray structure of GB1 using continuous folding
structure units. These sequences fold autonomously into separate semifolds
independently. Type I hydrophobic core networks are present within
respective semifolds, and type II hydrophobic core networks are present
between different semifolds. Hydrophobic interactions in type I and
type II hydrophobic core networks based on the limit distance (8.5
Å) are the most intuitive understanding of the folding event
for GB1 fold.

Folding of autonomous sequences commenced on multiple
defined folding
pathways synchronously by hydrophobic interactions in type I networks.
In fact, type I hydrophobic core networks of a 16-residue autonomous
sequence fragment of GB1 stabilized a β-hairpin dramatically
via hydrophobic cores between different folding structures,27,28 whereas type II hydrophobic core networks assembled semifolds to
yield GB1 fold based on the tertiary structure information of GB1.
Similarly, type I hydrophobic core networks of apomyoglobin stabilized
respective semifolds independently, whereas type II hydrophobic core
networks of apomyoglobin conducted cooperative stabilization of both
the semifolds dramatically by another level of organization in semifolds,
that is, assembly. Those of different levels of organization in semifolds,
folding and assembly, are fundamental concepts in protein structure
construction. This organization in semifolds supports the jigsaw puzzle
model and foldon-based defined pathway model.16,23

2.3 Two Autonomous Sequences in Myoglobin Characterized
by Type I Hydrophobic Core Networks
Each autonomous sequence
in myoglobin was defined by a small set of continuous folding structure
units forming a semifold, in which α-helix folding structure
units of apomyoglobin were connected by hydrophobic cores within respective
semifolds. Figure 2 shows the full view of type I hydrophobic core networks of apomyoglobin
and two autonomous sequences. Type I hydrophobic core networks within
respective semifolds were the decisive feature for characterizing
the autonomous sequences. The small set of continuous folding structure
units in Figure 1 were
assigned to the corresponding autonomous sequence. Two autonomous
sequences in myoglobin fold into the corresponding two semifolds.
Similarly, two sets of continuous folding structure units in GB1 assembled
into the corresponding two semifolds. Apomyoglobin and GB1 fold are
composed of one domain, and these domains are comprised of two respective
semifolds.

The N-terminal and C-terminal α-helix folding
structure units of each autonomous sequence have no hydrophobic core
with the adjacent autonomous sequences. In case of apomyoglobin, E
helix was not connected with G helix via a hydrophobic core. As a
result, the myoglobin sequence was divided into two autonomous sequences, 1 and 2, using hydrophobic cores and continuous
α-helix folding structure units, shown in Figure 1.

Autonomous sequence 1 and 2 folded autonomously
into respective separate semifold 1′ and 2′ based on the tertiary structure information for
semifolds. Blue lines in Figure 2 represent a hydrophobic core network I-1 [L2–W7 (6.3), W7–L76 (8.4), V10–L76 (8.0), L11–L76 (7.4), W14–L76 (8.5), V17–V21 (5.8), A19–V21 (6.3), V21–L69 (6.8), V21–V66 (5.9), A22–L69 (8.4), A22–V66 (5.2), L29–L61 (8.1), I30–M55 (6.7), L32–P37 (7.7), L32–L40 (8.2), F33–P37 (5.0), F33–L40(5.3), L40–F46 (6.8), F46–M55 (8.3), F46–L61 (7.0), L49–M55 (6.0), M55–L61 (7.1), A57–L61 (8.1)]. The numbers in parentheses are distances between
α-carbon coordinates of hydrophobic cores (Å). The hydrophobic
core network was formed within autonomous sequence 1 of
80 amino acid residues V1–G80 to stabilize
the discrete hydrophobic region in semifold 1′.

Hydrophobic regions of A, B, C, C′, D, and E helices
were
stabilized by hydrophobic cores in the network I-1. The
hydrophobic cores in the network I-1 were pairs of topology-local
hydrophobic amino acids in different folding structure units. The
terminal hydrophobic amino acids of folding structures, such as L2, A19, V21, P37, and A57 in Figure 1, formed hydrophobic cores as the cap (L2) or internal
(A19, V21, P37, and A57) residues of adjacent folding structures. Helix bends A/B, B/C,
and D/E created hydrophobic cores in the network I-1.
The C′ helix was a distorted 310-helix, and the
hexapeptide sequence L49–E54 formed a
π-turn, which was an overlapping secondary structure. The distance
between the N-terminal and C-terminal α-carbon coordinates of
the π-turn was 5.8 Å.

Hydrophobic core network I-2 [P100–Y151 (8.0), I101–I142 (8.0), I101–A143 (6.7), I101–Y146 (8.4), I112–M131 (7.4), L115–P120 (7.7), L115–F123 (6.9), F123–A125 (6.7), F123–A127 (5.2), Y146–Y151 (4.9), L149–Y151 (5.8)] (purple
lines in Figure 2)
was formed within autonomous sequence 2 of 55 amino acid
residues I99–G153, and the hydrophobic
regions of G and H helices were stabilized by hydrophobic cores in
the network I-2. The numbers in parentheses are distances
between α-carbon coordinates of hydrophobic cores (Å).
Semifold 2′ was a folding intermediate. Practically,
it was an unstable α-hairpin forming the hydrophobic cores between
hydrophobic amino acids in the N-terminal sequence of G helix and
those in the C-terminal sequence of H helix.26 The C-terminal amino acid Y151 of H29 (F123–Y151) formed hydrophobic cores as the cap residue
of HC4 (G150–G153). The hexapeptide sequence
Y146–Y151 formed the π-turn of
Schellman motif.38

The hydrophobic
region of a semifold is always observed in the
X-ray structure of holomyoglobin regardless of the stability of the
semifold characteristic to the autonomous sequence fragment. The stability
of semifolds strongly depends on hydrophobic cores in respective semifolds.
Autonomous sequences encoding tertiary structure information for semifolds
are pivotal probes of protein-folding information.

2.4 Discrete Hydrophobic Regions of Separate Semifolds
Characterized by Respective Autonomous Sequences
A semifold
of apomyoglobin creates the discrete hydrophobic region by assembly
of hydrophobic regions in the corresponding continuous folding structure
units. Thus, the autonomous sequence was also defined by the tertiary
structure information for the semifold using hydrophobic regions in
continuous folding structure units. To characterize the hydrophobic
region of the semifold decisively, precise definitions of hydrophobic
and hydrophilic regions in apomyoglobin were required. We characterized
the hydrophobic region of apomyoglobin using hydrophobic regions of
amphiphilic helices and hydrophobic cores. Necessarily, discrete hydrophobic
regions of separate semifolds of apomyoglobin were characterized by
using respective autonomous sequences decisively.

Each amino
acid in an α-helix can be numbered according to a heptad repeat
sequence (1234567). Seven successive amino acids proceed two turns
of the α-helix.39 To define the hydrophobic
and hydrophilic regions of amphiphilic α-helices, hydrophobic
amino acids in the hydrophobic region were numbered to maximize the
number of hydrophobic amino acids in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.
When amino acids at positions 2 and 7 were hydrophobic, the hydrophobic
region was defined as positions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7, whereas the hydrophilic
region was defined as positions 3 and 6. The positions 1, 4, and 5
as well as 3 and 6 are always hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions,
respectively, regardless of the amino acids.

Most hydrophobic
amino acids of the A, B, C, C′, D, E, G,
and H helices of apomyoglobin grew respective hydrophobic regions,
and residual ones distributed in hydrophilic regions. The residual
ones were as follows: L9 (6) and V13 (3) in
A helix, V66 (6) in E helix, I112 (6) in G helix,
A130 (3), L137 (3), and Y146 (6)
in H helix. The numbers in parentheses are the position numbers of
wheel description of each helix. The C′ helix was a distorted
310-helix, and F43, F46, and L49 were hydrophobic amino acids in the hydrophobic region.

However, all the hydrophobic amino acids in hydrophilic regions
formed hydrophobic cores to stabilize the hydrophobic regions of semifolds
within respective autonomous sequences. L9 and V13 residues in A helix
formed hydrophobic cores with (F123, A127, A130, and M131) and (L115, F123, and A127), respectively, in type II network (Figure 3); V66 (E helix) and I12 (G helix) residues with (V21 and A22) and M131, respectively, in type I
networks (Figure 2);
A130 and L137 residues in H helix with L2 and V1, respectively, in type II network (Figure 3); and Y146 residue in H helix with Y151 in type I network (Figure 2). Thus, parts of
hydrophobic amino acids in hydrophilic regions of amphiphilic α-helices
were classified into those of hydrophobic regions in respective semifolds
by hydrophobic core formation with a different semifold. As a result,
all hydrophobic amino acids in the helices were those in the hydrophobic
regions of each semifold. The hydrophobic amino acids of respective
discrete hydrophobic regions in semifolds 1′ and 2′ were as follows. Semifold 1′: V1, L2, W7, L9, V10, L11, V13, W14, A15, V17, A19, V21, A22,
I28, L29, I30, L32, F33, P37, L40, F43, F46, L49, A53, M55, A57,
L61, V66, V68, L69, A71, L72, A74, I75, and L76; semifold 2′: P100, I101, Y103, L104, F106, I107, A110, I111, I112, V114, L115, P120, F123, A125, A12p7, A130, M131, A134, L135, L137, F138, I142, A143, A144, Y146, L149, and Y151.

Put in a concrete form (e.g.,
L9, V13, A130, and L137) above, all the hydrophobic amino
acids in each semifold were stabilized by hydrophobic interactions
in type I and type II hydrophobic core networks (Figures 2 and 3) within each autonomous sequence. V1 and L2, P120 and F123, and Y151 were hydrophobic
amino acids in the N-terminal folding structure, α-turn, and
C-terminal folding structure, respectively. The discrete hydrophobic
regions of separate semifolds were characterized decisively by respective
autonomous sequences. Finally, all the hydrophobic amino acids in
myoglobin except for the sequence H81–I99 were those in the hydrophobic region of apomyoglobin.

2.5 Type II Hydrophobic Core Network Assembles
Semifolds To Yield Apomyoglobin
The tertiary structure information
in autonomous sequences was characterized by preferential formation
of discrete hydrophobic regions of respective semifolds within each
autonomous sequence. They were independently stabilized by hydrophobic
interactions in type I hydrophobic core networks. On the contrary,
type II hydrophobic core network was formed between the discrete hydrophobic
regions of different semifolds. Thus, it assembled semifolds to yield
apomyoglobin based on the tertiary structure information of myoglobin.

The type II hydrophobic core network of apomyoglobin was as follows.
Hydrophobic core network II-1′, 2′ (V1–L137, L2–A130, L2–A134, W7–A130, W7–M131, W7–A134, L9–F123, L9–A127, L9–A130, L9–M131, V10–A127, V10–A130, V10–M131, V10–A134, V13–L115, V13–F123, V13–A127, V17–L115, I28–I107, I28–A110, I28–I111, I28–V114, L29–I107, L29–A110, L32–F106, L32–I107, L32–A110, I75–F138 and L76–A134) (red lines in Figure 3) was formed between
semifolds 1′ and 2′. The hydrophobic
region of apomyoglobin propagated between those of semifolds 1′ and 2′ via hydrophobic interactions
in type II hydrophobic core network, to dramatically stabilize both
the semifolds. The semifolds assembled to yield apomyoglobin.

Myoglobin forms the most thermodynamically stable structure based
on its amino acid sequence. This is Anfinsen’s tenet of protein
folding.1,2 Thus, the assembly of semifolds by hydrophobic
interactions in type II hydrophobic core network strongly supports
that autonomous sequences of myoglobin take up the most thermodynamically
stable state (semifolds) as folding intermediates at the beginning
of the folding process, based on the amino acid sequence. For example,
the autonomous sequence V1–G80 formed
semifold 1′ autonomously at the beginning of the
folding process of the autonomous sequence, and semifold 1′ was fixed at the end of the assembly process of semifolds.

Hydrophobic interactions in type II hydrophobic core network differentiate
the stability of semifolds in apomyoglobin from the instability of
folds characteristic to autonomous sequence fragments because of the
absence of type II network. This differentiation leads to the general
observation that fragment structures of protein chains are predominantly
nonnative.25,26 Semifolds were always observed
in the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin. Thus, the most significant
feature of semifolds in apomyoglobin was that they could be verified
by the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin regardless of the instability
of folds characteristic to autonomous sequence fragments.

3 Conclusions
Myoglobin folding proceeded along normalized
folding structure
formation together with hydrophobic core formation throughout the
myoglobin sequence, which was composed of continuous folding structure
units of apomyoglobin. It is the most important for the determination
of hydrophobic cores to differentiate those from simple hydrophobic
contacts in identical folding structure units using continuous folding
structure units in Figure 1. The hydrophobic cores in apomyoglobin were classified into
type I hydrophobic core networks within respective semifolds and type
II hydrophobic core networks between different semifolds using continuous
folding structure units. Each autonomous sequence in myoglobin was
defined by a small set of continuous folding structure units forming
a semifold. Each of the separate semifolds was stabilized by hydrophobic
interactions in type I hydrophobic core networks. Autonomous sequence 1 and 2 in myoglobin were characterized by respective
type I hydrophobic core networks to fold autonomously into separate
semifolds 1′ and 2′ on each
separate framework. The entire framework assigned to the myoglobin
sequence was divided into two separate frameworks, and the defined
characteristic of the autonomous sequences was small sets of continuous
α-helix folding structure units connected by hydrophobic cores.
The autonomous sequence was also defined by the tertiary structure
information for a semifold. The tertiary structure information was
characterized by preferential formation of the discrete hydrophobic
region of the semifold by assembly of hydrophobic regions in continuous
folding structure units. Necessarily, the discrete hydrophobic regions
of each separate semifold were characterized decisively by using respective
autonomous sequences. The discrete hydrophobic region of a semifold
propagated itself by hydrophobic interactions in type II hydrophobic
core network between different semifolds. Hydrophobic interactions
in type II hydrophobic core network differentiate the instability
of folds characteristic to autonomous sequence fragments from the
stability of semifolds in apomyoglobin. This differentiation leads
to the general observation that fragment structures of protein chains
are predominantly nonnative.25,26 The most significant
feature of semifolds in apomyoglobin was that they could be verified
by the X-ray structure of holomyoglobin regardless of the instability
of folds characteristic to autonomous sequence fragments.

4 Methods
4.1 Dissection of the X-ray Structure of Holomyoglobin
into Continuous Folding Structure Units
The X-ray structure
of holomyoglobin was dissected into continuous folding structure units
using a two-dimensional structural representation as described precisely
in ref (5). Folding
structure units were determined based on the continuity of backbone
dihedral angles (ϕ and φ) in α-regions (−130
≤ ϕ ≤ −30, −80 ≤ φ
≤ +30). Dihedral angles of the cap residues of α-helix
and turn folding structure units are outside the α-region. Interconnecting
folding structure units were located between the α-region sequences.
Continuous folding structure units in Figure 1 play a pivotal role in determination of
hydrophobic cores.

4.2 Calculation of RFA Values
RFA values
of local sequences for respective folding structure units were calculated
using the table of NFP in ref (5), as mentioned in the text. For example, RFA value of C
helix (S35–D44) in myoglobin was calculated
as follows: RFA (C helix) = (NFP of S35 for a′) × (NFP of H36 for a) × (NFP of
P37 for b) × (NFP of E38 for c) × (NFP of T39 for d) ×
(NFP of L40 for f) × (NFP of E41 for g) × (NFP of K42 for h) × (NFP of F43 for i) × (NFP of
D44 for i′) = 45.

4.3 Selection of Hydrophobic Cores
Hydrophobic
cores were selected from a table of distances of the α-carbon
coordinates of hydrophobic contacts. The table is available in the Supporting Information. They were determined
using the α-carbon coordinates of holomyoglobin and GB1 (Protein
Data Bank accession: 1MBC and 1PGB). α-Carbon coordinates were obtained from DSSP
files for 1MBC and 1PGB. It is the most important for selection of hydrophobic cores to
differentiate those from simple hydrophobic contacts in identical
folding structure units using continuous folding structure units in Figure 1. For example, W7–L9 (5.3), W7–V10 (4.8), and W7–L11 (6.0) are simple
hydrophobic contacts in α-helix folding structure unit. They
do not form hydrophobic core. They were excluded from hydrophobic
core selection according to the definition of simple hydrophobic contacts.
