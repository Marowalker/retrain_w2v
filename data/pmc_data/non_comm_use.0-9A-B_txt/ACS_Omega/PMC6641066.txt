As an anode material
for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), hard carbon
(HC) presents high specific capacity and favorable cycling performance.
However, high cost and low initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) of HC
seriously limit its future commercialization for SIBs. A typical biowaste,
mangosteen shell was selected as a precursor to prepare low-cost and
high-performance HC via a facile one-step carbonization method, and
the influence of different heat treatments on the morphologies, microstructures,
and electrochemical performances was investigated systematically. The microstructure evolution studied using X-ray diffraction, Raman,
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller, and high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, along with electrochemical measurements, reveals
the optimal carbonization condition of the mangosteen shell: HC carbonized
at 1500 °C for 2 h delivers the highest reversible capacity of
∼330 mA h g–1 at a current density of 20
mA g–1, a capacity retention of ∼98% after
100 cycles, and an ICE of ∼83%. Additionally, the sodium-ion
storage behavior of HC is deeply analyzed using galvanostatic intermittent
titration and cyclic voltammetry technologies.

Introduction
Currently, sodium-ion
batteries (SIBs) have attracted considerable
attention for large-scale energy storage because of the abundance
of sodium resources throughout the world.1−3 However, the
development of low-cost and high-performance electrode materials is
the key to commercializing sodium-based batteries. Fortunately, a
series of high-performance cathode materials for SIBs have been discovered,4,5 including layered oxides (P2- and O3-type layered oxides),6−11 tunnel-type oxides,12 phosphates,13−16 and sulfates.17 In particular, Prussian
blue analogues with a high reversible capacity (RC) of ∼160
mA g–1 are ideal for commercial applications because
of their simple preparation and low cost.18−22 Recently, high-capacity P2-type Na0.67[Fe0.5Mn0.5]O29 and high-voltage polyanionic Na3V2(PO4)2F323 have been studied as novel cathode materials for SIBs, which show
specific capacities comparable with the current commercial cathodes
in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) currently used for commercial small-scale
applications, including hand-held devices like phones and tablets.

In addition, anode materials for SIBs have also been widely studied,
including alloys,24−28 oxides,29−31 organic compounds,32−34 and carbon materials.35−48 The big volume expansion of alloy anodes during sodium insertion
results in the loss of electric contact and fast capacity fading.
The capacities of oxide anodes are very small. Organic compounds,
for example disodium terephthalate (Na2C8H4O4), suffer from poor cycling stability, low initial
Coulombic efficiency (ICE), and insufficient electronic conductivity.

As we know, graphite is the most widely used anode material in
LIBs because of its abundant resource, excellent electronic conductivity,
low average potential, and outstanding cycling stability. Unfortunately,
graphite shows poor electrochemical performance as an anode material
for SIBs using traditional carbonate electrolytes.39,44,49 Recently, carbonate electrolytes have been
substituted by ether-based electrolytes to obtain a RC of ∼150
mA h g–1 in SIBs using a graphite anode,50,51 but the capacity is still far from satisfying the practical needs.

To date, hard carbon (HC) is one of the most promising anode materials
for SIBs because of its low average potential and high RC. Thus, HCs
prepared from glucose,42 PAN fibers,52,53 phenolic resin (PF),54 resorcinol formaldehyde
(RF) resin,55−57 and other polymers48,58 have attracted
much research interests; especially, PF is one kind of flexible precursor
leading to high-purity HC and allowing the production of carbon materials
with controllable microstructures and morphologies. As reported, HCs
derived from PF has a perfect spherule shape, large interlayer distance,
and disordered microstructure, which bring about sodium-ion intercalation
and storage with a capacity of ∼310 mA h g–1 and long-cycle electrochemical stability.54

For developing low-cost HC anode for SIBs, many biomass sources—such
as silk,38 banana peels,36 peat moss,35 pomelo peels,59 lignin,60,61 sucrose,42 and cellulose nanofiber62—have been used as precursors, and their derived carbons demonstrate
suitable performance as anodes for SIBs.

However, for now, there
are still two keys to facilitate industrialized
processing of biomass-based HCs: (1) a general carbonization technology
leading to the best performance and high yields from various biomass
sources with the lowest energy consumption and (2) a comprehensive
understanding of sodium-ion storage behaviors in the different biomass-based
HCs.

In most of the preceding studies, carbonization temperature
has
been extensively investigated, but carbonization time—a key
factor for using less energy—has been always ignored. In this
work, mangosteen shell, a typical biowaste, was carbonized through
a systemic heat treatment process. The as-prepared HCs at different
heating temperatures and times reveal discrepant sodium-ion storage
behaviors. The sodium-ion storage behavior varies from chemi-/physisorption
on surface functional groups and heteroatoms to the insertion process
resulting in disordered carbon nanovoids, which display different
potentials and capacities, respectively. A possible sodium-ion storage
mechanism in HC is proposed.

Results and Discussion
Figure S1 shows the digital photograph
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image (after mechanical crushing)
of the mangosteen shell precursor. The reddish-brown mangosteen shell
turns into brown powder after being dried and smashed. The as-prepared
powder turns black after pyrolysis, and the carbon yields under different
carbonization conditions are listed in Table S1. SEM images of HCs carbonized at different temperature and time
are shown in Figures S2 and S3, respectively,
and all of the HC particles maintain irregular shapes with smooth
surfaces, which means that the different carbonization process has
little effect on the particle size and surface morphology.

Figure 1a,c shows
X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of HC-Ts carbonized at different
temperatures and HC-hs carbonized for different times. All XRD patterns
exhibit two broad peaks at ∼24° and ∼43°,
which are assigned to the crystallographic planes of (002) and (101)
in the carbon structure, respectively. Obviously, with increasing
carbonization temperature, the (002) peak of HC-Ts becomes sharper
and shifts right significantly, which indicates not only an increase
in long-range order degree but also a decrease in HC-Ts interplanar
spacing (d002). Differently, with increasing
carbonization time from 0.5 to 5 h at 1500 °C, the (002) peak
of HC-hs roughly maintains the shape. Only its position is altered,
which shifts to a higher angle; this suggests that the change in interplanar
spacing is more obvious than that on the order degree in HC-hs with
prolonged sintering time.

patterns and (b) Raman spectra normalized by the peak height of G-band

for 2 h. (c) XRD patterns and (d) Raman spectra normalized by the
peak height of G-band of HC carbonized at 1500 °C for 0.5–5
h.

On the basis of the Bragg equation
2d sin θ
= nλ, the d002 values
of HC-Ts are shown in Table 1. With increasing carbonization temperature, the d002 value shrinks gradually from 3.84 to 3.66 Å,
but this is still much larger than that of graphite (∼3.4 Å)
and ensures facile sodium-ion insertion/extraction between the graphene
layers. The average thicknesses of graphitic domains (Lc) were obtained using the Scherrer equation with the
peak positions and full width at half-maximum (FWHM) values of (002)
peak. Lc increases slightly with increasing
carbonization temperature. According to the d002 value and Lc, the number of
interlayers stocked in the graphitic domains can be roughly estimated.
For instance, the Lc and d002 of HC1500C2h are 1.64 nm and 3.67 Å, respectively,
indicating that the graphitic domain of HC1500C2h is made up of 5–6
stacked graphene layers (n = 1.64/0.367 + 1). The
number of the stocked interlayers in graphitic domains increases slowly
from 4–5 to 5–6 as the carbonization temperature increases
from 800 to 1600 °C.

Figure 1b,d displays
the Raman spectra of HCs normalized by the peak height of G-band.
All of them show two bands located at ∼1350 and ∼1600
cm–1 corresponding to the defect induced D band
and the crystalline graphite G band of carbon,63,64 respectively. The comparative intensity ratio of the G band and
D band (IG/ID) is used to quantify the disorder degree of carbon materials.36,63,64Figure S4 shows the fitting Raman curves of HC-Ts, and the calculated value
of IG/ID is
shown in Table 1. Interestingly,
with increasing carbonization temperature, the intensity of D band
increases, but its FWHM gradually decreases, and the value of IG/ID keeps increasing,
which shows a change in the structure from amorphous to planar graphite
microlites. In addition, Figure 1d shows the Raman spectra of HC-hs. With increasing
carbonization time, the peak intensity of D band decreases, and the
value of IG/ID increases continuously (see Table S2),
indicating the promoted graphitization degree. The results comport
with the XRD results.

The high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) images
of HC-Ts are displayed in Figure 2a–d [inset selected area electron diffraction
(SAED)]. The disordered structure observed shows a degree of amorphous
of HC-Ts. The results suggest that the local ordered structures, which
represent nanographite domains, become more distinct at a higher carbonization
temperature. All SAED patterns exhibit dispersive diffraction rings,
which further confirm the disordered microstructure of HC-Ts. The
diffraction ring becomes sharper with increasing carbonization temperature,
which demonstrates a tendency toward ordered structure. In addition,
some graphitic domains arise in the local ordered structure of HC800C2h.
With increasing carbonization temperature, the graphitic domains become
more apparent in HC1300C2h combined with an appearance of nanovoids
surrounded by some parallel carbon hexagonal layers. The maximum amount
of nanovoids with a size of ∼1 nm is achieved in HC1500C2h
(see Figure 2c) and
a minimum amount at 1100 °C, which is due to the random packing
and agglomerations of carbon layers at a higher temperature. Subsequently,
both increasing temperature and extending time, the amount of such nanovoids will drop,
as shown in Figure 2d–f.

Figure S6a–e displays the
cyclic
voltammetry (CV) curves at a scan rate of 0.2 mV s–1 in a voltage range of 0–2 V. A small reduction peak located
at ∼0.5 V is observed in the first scan and disappears in the
subsequent cycles, which is attributed to an irreversible reaction
of the electrolyte with surface functional groups of the active material
and formation of the solid–electrolyte interface (SEI) layer.
As we know, the formation of the SEI layer and other irreversible
reactions directly result in a low ICE. Table 1 shows that the ICE of HC-Ts improves remarkably
with increasing carbonization temperature. The results show that the
larger specific surface area (see Table 1 and Figure S7) and higher amount of functional groups remained at a lower carbonization
temperature, thus leading to a lower ICE.

Figure 3a shows
the typical initial galvanostatic charge/discharge profiles of HC-Ts
at a current density of 20 mA g–1 in a voltage range
of 0–2 V. The specific capacities of HC-Ts are ∼70,
220, 280, 330, and 270 mA h g–1. All charge/discharge
profiles except for HC800C2h show a flat plateau region at a potential
∼0.2 V and a sloping region in the range of 0.2–1 V
(see Figure S8). The effect of carbonization
temperature on the plateau region capacity (PRC) and sloping region
capacity (SRC) is summed up in Figure 3b. With increasing carbonization temperature, the SRC
decreases slowly and the PRC significantly increases with the highest
value obtained at 1500 °C. On the basis of the results of XRD,
Raman, and HR-TEM, HC-Ts have less defect, more nanographite, and
nanovoids at higher carbonization temperature. Therefore, the results
suggest that the SRC comes from sodium-ion storage in the defects,
edges, and surface of HC-Ts, whereas the PRC is produced by sodium-ion
storage in the interlayer of nanographite and nanovoids formed by
nanographite. At a lower carbonization temperature, HC-Ts contain
larger specific surface area, as well as a higher number of surface
functional groups, heteroatoms, and defects. Thus, an absorption/desorption
behavior of sodium-ion storage is displayed in HC800C2h.

Summarized PRC and SRC in the first charge at 20 mA g–1. (c) Cycling performance at 20 mA g–1. (d) Charge
capacity at various current densities.

However, there are few nanographite domains and nanovoids,
both
of which contribute greatly to sodium storage capacity. Undoubtedly,
HC800C2h shows a much lower capacity compared with HC pyrolyzed at
higher temperatures.

Figure 3c shows
the cycling performance of HC-Ts at a constant current density of
20 mA g–1. All of the HC-Ts anodes deliver excellent
cycling stability. The highest specific capacity of ∼330 mA
h g–1 is obtained in HC1500C2h with a capacity retention
of ∼98% after 100 cycles. The superior cycling performance
of HC-Ts is attributed to their unique stable 3D disordered structures
formed at high carbonization temperatures. A comparison of the electrochemical
performances between our mangosteen shell based HCs and some reported
biomass-based HCs is listed in Table S3, in which our HC delivers preferable ICE and RC.

Figure 3d shows
the rate capability of HC-Ts anodes tested at various current densities
from 20 to 200 mA g–1. All HC-Ts anodes deliver
good rate performance, and HC1500C2h delivers the highest specific
capacity at low current densities, whereas HC1300C2h exhibits the
best rate capability. Importantly, all HC-Ts anodes retain their high
reversible capacities when the current density decreases from 200
to 20 mA g–1, which indicates that the high-rate
cycling does not perpetually destroy the microstructures of HC-Ts
and their capacity can restore to the original structure at a small
current density.

Figure 4a displays
the charge/discharge profiles of HC-hs at a current density of 20
mA g–1 in the voltage range of 0–2 V. HC1500C2h
delivers the highest RC of ∼330 mA h g–1 with
the highest PRC ≈ 250 mA h g–1 and ICE ≈
83% in the electrochemical curves (see Figure 4b and Table S1, respectively). This is due to the most number of sodium-ion storage
sites in the HC1500C2h anode material, which is well-supported by
all characterizations in particular from HR-TEM. As shown in Figure 4c, all HC-hs anodes deliver excellent cycling performance with capacity
retention over 92% after 100 cycles at the current density of 20 mA
g–1 and a high ICE ≈ 80%.

V. (b) Summarized PRC and SRC in the first charge at 20 mA g–1. (c) Cycling performance at 20 mA g–1. (d) Charge
capacity at various current densities.

Figure 4d
shows
the rate performance of the HC-hs at various current densities from
20 to 200 mA g–1. Interestingly, HC1500C2h shows
not only the highest specific capacity at a low-current density of
20 mA g–1 but also the best rate performance among
the HC-hs anodes. This point is very important for the future commercialization
of anodes for SIBs. Specifically, Figure S10 shows the change in rules on the influence of carbonization temperature
and time on the PRC and SRC, respectively, under various current densities.
Interestingly, Figure S10a,c shows a linear
relationship between PRC and the current density when the current
is less than 120 mA g–1. However, the impact of
the current density on SRC is less than PRC (see Figure S10b), which is attributed to the different sodium-ion
storage mechanisms in these two voltage regions and the severe polarization
at high current rates.

For insight into sodium-ion storage mechanisms
of HCs, galvanostatic
intermittent titration (GITT) was used to measure sodium-ion diffusion
coefficient. Figure 5a shows the GITT curves of HC1500C2h anode at the second cycle from
0 to 2.0 V. During the GITT tests, the sodiation and desodiation were
carried out at a constant current density of 20 mA g–1 for 10 min, followed by an open-circuit stand for value (Es). The sodium-ion diffusion coefficient of
HC1500C2h is determined by solving Fick’s second law of diffusion
using the following equation through a series of assumptions and simplifications65−68 1  where MB and mB are the molecular weight and
mass of the electrode
material, L is the thickness of the electrode, S is the surface area of the active material estimated from
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) data, VB is the molar volume of the electrode material, and τ
is the current duration time. When there is a good linear relationship
between cell voltage and τ1/2 during titration (see Figure S11), eq 1 can be simplified as 2  

Figure 5 GITT
test for HC1500C2h. (a) GITT charge/discharge profiles at
the second cycle. (b) Potential profile before, during, and after
a constant current pulse with schematic labeling of different parameters.
Na+ ion ADCs estimated from the GITT charge/discharge profiles
for (c) sodiation and (d) desodiation processes at the second cycle.

To simplify the calculation, VM is
assumed to be a constant throughout the electrochemical process. ΔEs and ΔEτ are obtained from the GITT curves following the method provided
by the current step diagram shown in Figure 5b. As shown in Figure 5c,d, the sodium-ion apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) of HC1500C2h is on the order of 10–9 cm2 s–1 during the sodiation and desodiation
processes. The inset of Figure 5c is the data in a low-voltage region of ∼0.1 V. During
the sodiation process, sodium-ion ADC undergoes a slow decrease to
the demarcation point at ∼0.1 V followed by a sharp decrease.
When the cell voltage reaches ∼0.06 V, the electrode delivers
the minimum sodium-ion ADC on the order of 10–13 cm2 s–1 until the voltage of ∼0.04
V, at which point sodium-ion ADC increases largely and then decreases
until the cutoff voltage. For the desodiation process, sodium-ion
ADC first decreases dramatically and then increases sharply to ∼0.1
V, followed by a relatively slow decrease until the cutoff voltage
(see Figure 5d). The
low- and high-voltage sides of the first inflection point appearing
at ∼0.1 V in Figure 5c,d correspond to the plateau region and sloping region on
the charge/discharge profiles, respectively, indicating that the emergence
of an inflection suggests a new starting electrochemical process.

It could be concluded that the lowest sodium-ion ADC mainly concentrates
at the plateau region of charge/discharge profiles. The extremely
low diffusion coefficient in the plateau region indicates that the
electrochemical reactions in this section are severely sluggish. This
phenomenon could be ascribed to the high kinetic barriers related
to the concurrent insertion/extraction of sodium-ions and structural
development, which offers a reasonable interpretation of the severe
capacity fading in the plateau region at high current densities. During
the sodiation process, there is a sudden increase in sodium-ion ADC
at ∼0.04 V, which suggests a new electrochemical behavior,
sodium metal-nanovoids filling,67,69 arising at this point.
Similarly, sodium metal-nanovoids filling is located at ∼0.01
V and holds lower kinetic barriers relative to insertion/extraction.53,70,71

To summarize, physical
and microstructure characterizations, electrochemical
tests, and GITT results of HC reveal that the SRC comes from sodium-ion
storage in the defects, edges, and surface, whereas the PRC is produced
by sodium-ion storage in interlayer of nanographite and nanovoids
formed by nanographite.

Conclusions
HC materials have been
successfully synthesized from biowaste mangosteen
shell via a simple, one-step carbonization process. The precursors
were carbonized at different temperatures from 800 to 1600 °C
for 2 h and at different times from 0.5 to 5 h at 1500 °C. The
as-prepared HCs exhibit different microstructure characteristics and
electrochemical performances. Structural evolution studied using XRD,
Raman, BET, and HR-TEM, along with electrochemical measurements, together
obtain an optimal carbonization condition of 1500 °C for 2 h.
HC1500C2h delivers the highest RC of ∼330 mA h g–1 (consisting of SRC ≈ 80 mA h g–1 and PRC
≈ 250 mA h g–1) at a current density of 20
mA g–1, the capacity retention of ∼98% after
100 cycles, and the ICE of ∼83%. In addition, the different
sodium-ion storage mechanisms related to SRC and PRC were deeply analyzed
using GITT and CV technologies to understand the sodium-ion storage
behaviors in the biomass-based HC anodes. This work is beneficial
to discover an optimal carbonization technology for various biomass
precursors as anodes for SIBs and to deepen the understanding of a
universal sodium-ion storage behavior in carbon-based materials.

Experimental
Section
Materials Synthesis
The collected mangosteen shell
was cut into small pieces, dried, and grounded with a micromill. The
obtained powder was loaded into a tubular furnace and carbonized at
a given temperature for a certain time at a heating rate of 3 °C
min–1 under an argon flow. More specifically, the
powder was pyrolyzed at a temperature range of 800–1600 °C
(interval of 100 °C) for 2 h (noted as HC-Ts) and at 1500 °C
for times of 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5 h (noted as HC-hs). The as-synthesized
HC-Ts and HC-hs are uniformly named by HCxCyh, where x represents sintering temperature
and y represents sintering time.

Materials Characterization
The morphology of the as-synthesized
HCs was observed using a VGA-3-SBH scanning electron microscope. The
specific surface area and pore structure of the HCs were characterized
using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 analyzer. HR-TEM and SAED observations
were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F TEM instrument. XRD patterns
were recorded using a PANalytical X’Pert instrument equipped
with Cu Kα radiation. Raman spectra were recorded using a Renishaw
Invia spectrometer with an Ar laser of 514.5 nm.

Electrochemical
Measurements
A slurry containing 80%
active material, 10% carbon black (Super-P), and 10% polyacrylic acid
sodium (binder) was dispersed in H2O. The obtained slurry
was coated onto a Cu foil and then dried at 120 °C overnight
in a vacuum oven. The active material mass loading of the electrodes
was ∼2.50 mg cm–2. 2032-type coin cells were
assembled with the working electrode, sodium counter electrode, glass
fiber separator, and sufficient electrolyte in an argon-filled glovebox.
The electrolyte was 1 M NaClO4 in ethylene carbonate (EC)
and propylene carbonate (PC) (1:1 by volume). The charge/discharge
measurements were taken using a Land BT2000 system (Wuhan, China).
CV was carried out using a PMC-500 instrument at a scan rate of 0.2
mV s–1 within a voltage range of 0–2 V. GITT
measurements were also taken using a Land BT2000 system under a 20
mA g–1 current pulse with 10 min duration and 40
min rest interval.
