We report the structural
analysis of highly drug-resistant human
immunodeficiency virus protease (PR) variant PRS17, rationally
selected by machine learning, in complex with substrate analogues.
Crystal structures were solved of inhibitor-free inactive PRS17-D25N, wild-type PR/CA-p2 complex, and PRS17 in complex
with substrate analogues, CA-p2 and p2-NC. Peptide analogues p2-NC
and CA-p2 exhibit inhibition constants of 514 and 22 nM, respectively,
for PRS17 or approximately 3-fold better than for PR. CA-p2
is a better inhibitor of PRS17 than are clinical inhibitors
(Ki = 50–8390 nM) except for amprenavir
(Ki = 11 nM). G48V resistance mutation
induces curled flap tips in PRS17-D25N structure. The inner
P2–P2′ residues of substrate analogues in PRS17 complexes maintain similar conformations to those of wild-type complex,
while significant conformational changes are observed in the peripheral
residues P3, P4′ of CA-p2 and P3, P4, and P3′ of p2-NC.
The loss of β-branched side chain by V82S mutation initiates
a shift in 80’s loop and reshapes the S3/S3′ subsite,
which enhances substrate binding with new hydrogen bonds and van der
Waals interactions that are absent in the wild-type structures. The
steric hindrance caused by G48V mutation in the flap of PRS17 contributes to altered binding interactions of P3 Arg, P4′
norleucine of CA-p2, and P4 and P3′ of p2-NC with the addition
of new hydrogen bonds and van der Waals contacts. The enhanced interaction
of PRS17 with substrate analogues agrees with their relative
inhibition, suggesting that this mutant improves substrate binding
while decreasing affinity for clinical inhibitors.

Introduction
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) currently
infects approximately
36.7 million people worldwide. At present, there is no cure for HIV
infection or AIDS.1 However, the advent
of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in the late 1990s using
a combination of reverse transcriptase and protease (PR) inhibitors
(PIs) dramatically suppressed the viral loads and increased CD4+ T-cell counts among infected patients.2,3 In
addition to viral fusion to host cell, reverse transcriptase, and
integrase, HIV protease (PR) is a critical antiretroviral drug target
due to its pivotal role in the processing of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins
during viral maturation. HIV PR is a homodimeric aspartic protease,
in which each 99 amino acid monomer contributes one of the two catalytic
triads (Asp25–Thr26–Gly27) required for catalytic function.4 The Gag and Gag-pol polyproteins are processed
by HIV PR at 10 sites by recognizing specific sequences of seven to
eight residues at the cleavage site. The substrate residues at the
cleavage site are numbered P4–P3–P2–P1–P1′–P2′–P3′–P4′
with the scissile peptide bond between P1 and P1′ residues. 18O exchange mass spectrometry studies have shown that the
peptide hydrolysis by HIV PR occurs through the formation of a reversible
and metastable gem–diol reaction intermediate.5 Several intermediates in the reaction pathway have been
identified in X-ray crystal structures.6 Inhibition of HIV PR leads to the disruption of the virus life cycle
at a vital stage.7 Currently, there are
nine Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved PR inhibitors (PIs)
that are available for cART. However, due to the rapid turnover rate
of HIV and the low fidelity of reverse transcriptase (∼2 ×
10–5 errors/nucleotide per replication cycle), mutations
in PR associated with resistance to each of the nine FDA-approved
PIs have decreased the efficacy of current treatment options.8,9 Accumulation of 10–20 mutations in PR may be required to
evolve high levels of resistance.10 Patients
with multidrug-resistant HIV PR were shown to have convergently evolved
patterns of accumulated resistance mutations.11

The recently studied HIV PR variant PRS17 has 17
mutations
compared to the wild-type PR and was selected by mean-shift clustering
on genotype–phenotype data using a new algorithm for predicting
drug resistance with a unified encoding of the sequence and three-dimensional
structure.12,13 PRS17 was predicted
to exhibit high-level resistance to six inhibitors: atazanavir, nelfinavir,
ritonavir, indinavir, lopinavir, and saquinavir, and was subsequently
confirmed to have resistance to eight of the nine currently available
clinical inhibitors except for tipranavir, which could not be measured
due to solubility limitations.14,15 Structural studies
using X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy have shown that PRS17 exhibits an open-flap conformation in the absence of inhibitor
in both crystal structure and in solution unlike the wild-type PR,
which is present in the closed-flap conformation without the inhibitor
in NMR studies.16 In spite of different
mutational profiles, correlated clusters of mutations in other multidrug-resistant
variants of HIV PR (PR20 and MDR 769) cause them to also favor an
open-flap conformation like PRS17 that lowers the binding
affinity of inhibitors.17,18 Altered dynamics of
the flap due to mutations is likely to increase dissociation rates
and, hence, decrease the potency of inhibitors.19 Clusters of mutations at the hinge loop in PRS17 and PR20 are associated with increased flap dynamics and enhanced
inhibitor dissociation of the two multidrug-resistant PRs.16,17 These mutational clusters that function synergistically to produce
conformational changes in the PR suggest convergent evolution by combinations
of single mutations. Variant PRS17 is about 10-fold less
efficient than the wild-type PR in processing the Gag polyprotein
while maintaining the same order of substrate cleavage.15 PRS17 is also 2-fold less efficient
than PR20 in Gag polyprotein processing and forms an excellent prototype
for structural studies on substrate binding to multidrug-resistant
PR.

HIV PR hydrolyzes several sites with markedly different
sequences
on the nascent polyprotein substrate. In order for PR to evolve resistance
to multiple drugs while maintaining catalytic efficiency for viral
replication, mutations that destabilize inhibitor binding must combine
with mutations that contribute to a new or altered form of substrate
binding. This perspective shifts the focus of structure-guided drug
design from point-based mutations to mutation clusters. Studying the
mechanism by which multidrug-resistant variants like PRS17 bind and cleave substrates may elucidate conserved methods of binding
across other mutant PRs with similar mutational clusters and give
insights for improved structure-guided drug design. In the current
study, we use structural and kinetic studies on PR, PRS17-D25N, and PRS17 with substrate analogues CA-p2 (R-V-L-r-F-E-A-Nle)
and p2-NC (Ace-T-I-Nle-r-Nle-Q-R) to evaluate differences in substrate
recognition between PRS17 and wild-type PR. The reduced
peptide analogues are suitable for structural studies with active
PR variants since they cannot be hydrolyzed. Ace and the isosteric
amino acid norleucine (Nle) in which the sulfur of the Met side chain
is replaced by a methylene group were used to simplify the synthesis.

Results
Substrate
Analogue Inhibition of PRS17
Gag
cleavage sites p2-NC and CA-p2 are the first and last proteolytic
sites to be processed in the Gag precursor.20 Mutations accumulating near the p2-NC cleavage site have been shown
to improve the processing fitness of a highly mutated HIV PR sequence
isolated from a patient failing antiviral therapy.21 Reduced peptide analogues corresponding to the amino acid
sequence of Gag cleavage sites act as competitive inhibitors of HIV
PR catalytic activity.22−24 In the present study, reduced peptide analogues for
p2-NC and CA-p2 cleavage sites inhibited the proteolytic activity
of the drug-resistant HIV-1 PR mutant PRS17. The kcat and Km values
measured for PRS17 are 69.7 ± 14.4 min–1 and 143 ± 33.0 μM, respectively. The kcat/Km of PRS17 is 0.49 ± 0.05 min–1 μM–1. Inhibition constants (Ki) measured
for PRS17 were 514 nM for p2-NC and 22 nM for CA-p2. The
inhibition constants (Ki) of substrate
analogues for PRS17 are compared with the values for PR
and PRV82A determined previously in Table 1. Interestingly, reduced peptide analogue
CA-p2 displays better inhibition values for PRS17 than
those of clinical inhibitors (Ki = 50–8390
nM) except for amprenavir (APV) (Ki =
11 nM), as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry.15 CA-p2 and p2-NC substrate analogues are 3.4
and 4.2-fold better inhibitors for PRS17, respectively,
when compared to PR whose Ki values are
75 nM and 2.17 μM. The major effect appears to be the mutation
to a smaller side chain at Val82, since PR bearing single mutation
V82A (PRV82A) displays almost identical inhibition kinetics
for CA-p2 (Ki = 24 nM) and p2-NC (Ki = 530 nM) as those measured for PRS17.24 PRS17 has a serine at this
position, which is the only mutation in the active-site cavity apart
from those in flaps.

Overall Structure
Crystal structures of inhibitor-free
PRS17-D25N and wild-type PR in complex with CA-p2 substrate
analogue were determined in the P3221
and P21212 space groups at
1.21 and 1.46 Å resolutions, respectively. PRS17 complex
with CA-p2 crystallized in the monoclinic space group P21 and was refined to 1.7 Å, while PRS17 in complex with p2-NC was determined in two different space groups P41 and P61 at 1.71
and 1.67 Å resolutions, respectively. The five structures were
refined to R-factors of 14.8–19.8%, as shown
in the crystallographic statistics of Table 2. The inhibitor-free PRS17-D25N
structure has one monomer in the asymmetric unit with residues numbered
1–99, while PR/CA-p2, PRS17-P41/p2-NC, and
PRS17-P61/p2-NC complexes contain a dimer of subunits
numbered 1–99 and 1′–99′ in the asymmetric
unit. The PRS17/CA-p2 complex has two dimers per asymmetric
unit. The substrate analogues bound at the active site in a single
conformation in all PR and PRS17 complexes. All 17 mutations
in the PRS17 (Figure 1A) and substrate analogues were unambiguously modeled
in the electron density maps (Figure 1B,C). The reorganization of the hinge loop by mutations
E35D, M36I, and S37D that breaks the ion pair anchoring the flaps
and thereby increases the flap flexibility as described in the previously
determined complex of PRS17 with darunavir (DRV)16 is also observed in the current substrate analogue
complexes.

Curling of
Flaps in PRS17-D25N
The current
crystal structure of PRS17-D25N at 1.21 Å is the highest-resolution
HIV PR structure in the open conformation available to date. Comparison
of inhibitor-free PRS17-D25N with the wild-type PR open
form without inhibitor (2PC0) shows that the two structures superpose with a root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) of 1.4 Å for the 99 topologically equivalent
Cα atoms. The maximum deviation of 6.9 Å between the two
structures occurs at Ile50 at the tip of the flap. Similar to the
wild-type PR, the flaps of PRS17-D25N are in an open conformation.
The three mutations M46L, G48V, and I54V in PRS17 flaps
act to curl the tip of flaps (Figure 2A). The twist in the flap starts at G48V of PRS17-D25N with a drastic change in ϕ angle by ∼172°
in comparison with Gly48 of the wild-type PR. The introduction of
Val48 side chain in PRS17-D25N results in ∼1.1 Å
shift of Phe53 side chain’s benzene ring when compared to that
of the wild-type PR. This shift results in the loss of van der Waals
contacts observed in the wild-type PR between the side chain of Phe53
and Gly48. In addition to the shift in Phe53, the mutation of Met46
to shorter Leu46 in PRS17-D25N also eliminates van der
Waals contacts observed in the wild-type PR between Phe53 and Met46.
This curling of flap tips propagates from G48V up to Gly52 in PRS17-D25N. As a result, the tip of the flap of PRS17-D25N moves ∼4.4 Å closer to 80’s loop, as measured
by the distance between the Cα atoms of Ile50 and Thr80. This
distance is 14.5 Å for the wild-type PR, while it is 10.1 Å
for the PRS17-D25N structure. The residues in 80’s
loop play an important role in the binding of both substrate and inhibitors
to PR. Conformational changes and shifts in the 80’s loop due
to resistant mutations can eliminate interactions with inhibitors
in both single mutants of PR and variants with multiple mutations.4,17,25 On the other hand, the flap curling
also increases by ∼1.4 Å, the distance between the flap
tip of PRS17-D25N and the active site, since the distance
between the Cα atoms of Asp25 and Ile50 increased from 17.6
Å in the wild-type structure to 19.0 Å in PRS17-D25N. Nearly identical curled flap conformation was seen in the
recently reported inhibitor-free PRS17 structure.16 The overall structure of PRS17-D25N
is very similar to the inhibitor-free PRS17 structure with
an RMSD of 0.18 Å for 99 equivalent Cα atoms. The maximum
deviation between the two structures occurs for residue Ile50 at the
flap tip with an RMSD of 1.1 Å. Similar to PRS17-D25N,
the flap curling in PRS17 starts with ∼176°
change in φ angle of G48V and ends at Gly52. However, the peptide
bond between Ile50 and Gly51 is flipped in PRS17 structure
in comparison to PRS17-D25N (Figure 2B). This flipped peptide bond enables residue
Ile50 at the flap tip of PRS17 to move closer to the 80’s
loop residue Thr81 (∼8.8 Å) than in PRS17-D25N
(10.1 Å), while the distance between catalytic Asp25/Asn25 and
the flap tip Ile50 remains more or less the same between the two structures
(18.7 Å for PRS17 and 19.0 Å for PRS17-D25N). Both conformations of the peptide bond between Ile50 and
Gly51 are observed in other PR structures, which suggest that it can
exist in either conformation. Also, PR with individual mutations of
M46L, G48V, and I54V in the flaps showed worse inhibition constants
(Ki) for DRV and saquinavir relative to
the wild-type PR.26,27 Thus, identical curling of flaps
in two independently determined structures of PRS17-D25N
and PRS17 strongly implies that the conformational changes
are due to the three mutations M46L, G48V, and I54V in the flaps of
PRS17 and contribute to the altered kinetic characteristics
of PRS17.

PRS17 Recognition
of the P2, P1′–P3′
Groups of CA-p2 Is Unaffected by the Resistance Mutations
The PRS17/CA-p2 structure has two PR dimers in the asymmetric
unit. The two dimers agree well and can be superposed with an RMSD
of 0.78 Å for the 198 canonically equivalent Cα atoms.
Comparison of the two dimers in PRS17/CA-p2 structure with
the wild-type PR/CA-p2 complex with one dimer in the asymmetric unit
shows RMSDs of 1.05 and 0.71 Å, respectively, for each dimer.
The maximum deviation of 4.4 Å occurs between residues Glu35′
of PR/CA-p2 and PRS17/CA-p2 in dimer 1, while 4.3 Å
deviation is observed between Glu35 positions in dimer 2. PR forms
a series of hydrogen bond interactions with the main-chain amide and
carbonyl of the substrate that are important for the recognition of
peptides.24 Similar hydrogen bonds between
the main chains of PR and substrate analogue were observed in both
the PR/CA-p2 and PRS17/CA-p2 complexes (Figure 3A), except for a new longer
hydrogen bond between the main-chain amide of P4′ Nle and the
side chain of Asp29′ or Asp30′ in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex, which will be discussed in a later section. The conformations
of P2 Val, P1′ Phe, P2′ Glu, and P3′ Ala of CA-p2
and their interactions with the wild-type PR and PRS17 are
similar in both complexes. However, conformational differences in
P1 Leu, P3 Arg, and P4′ Nle of CA-p2 and variations in their
interaction with PR residues are observed between the PR/CA-p2 and
PRS17/CA-p2 complexes.

PRS17 (green

are shown as red spheres in this and subsequent figures. Hydrogen
bonds are shown in black dotted lines, and the new hydrogen bond observed
between PRS17 and CA-p2 is shown in red dotted line. (B)

carbon) and PR/CA-p2 (gray carbon). The van der Waals contacts are
represented by (− · – · −)
lines in green in PRS17/CA-p2 and in black in the PR/CA-p2
complex.

The P1 Leu of PR/CA-p2 forms van
der Waals interactions with the
β-branched aliphatic side chain of Val82′. In the PRS17/CA-p2 complex, Val82 is mutated to polar Ser82, which alters
the size of the S1 pocket where P1 Leu binds. The P1 Leu side chain
in PRS17/CA-p2 is rotated by ∼46° about the
χ2 angle in comparison to its conformation in the
wild-type complex, thus enabling P1 Leu to retain its van der Waals
interaction with the side chain of V82′S in PRS17 (Figure 3B). The
conformational change in the side chain of P1 Leu also facilitates
the retention of van der Waals contacts with Leu23′, Gly27,
Ile50, Pro81′, and Ile84′ observed in the PR/CA-p2 complex
(Figure 3B). The P1
Leu of CA-p2 in the second dimer of the PRS17/CA-p2 complex
exhibits an identical conformation change with ∼46° rotation
about χ2 angle and retention of van der Waals contact
with V82′S side chain, which further confirms that the observed
change in P1 Leu of CA-p2 occurs in response to V82′S mutation
in PRS17.

Altered Recognition of CA-p2 P3 Arg Modulated
by V82S Mutation
The P3 Arg main chain of PR/CA-p2 is fixed
in position by the hydrogen
bond between the N-terminal group of P3 and the side chain of Asp29
and a second hydrogen bond between the main-chain carbonyl of P3 Arg
and the main-chain amide of Asp29. These two hydrogen bonds between
Asp29 and the main chain of P3 Arg are also present in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex (Figure 4A). The side chain of P3 Arg in the wild-type complex
extends over the Gly48 in the first strand of the flap and forms van
der Waals contacts with the Phe53 side chain in the second strand
of the flap. In PRS17, the Val side chain of G48V mutation
produces steric hindrance and prevents the formation of the interaction
between Phe53 and P3 Arg observed in the wild-type PR complex. The
tip of Phe53 benzene ring in PRS17/CA-p2 moves away by
more than 2 Å in comparison to the wild-type complex. In the
PRS17/CA-p2 complex, P3 Arg is observed in three different
conformations. Conformation 1 is in dimer 1 of the PRS17/CA-p2 complex, while conformations 2 and 3 of P3 Arg are present
as alternate conformations of 0.5 occupancy each in dimer 2 of the
PRS17/CA-p2 complex. Due to the steric hindrance caused
by G48V mutation, all three conformations of the side chain of P3
Arg in PRS17/CA-p2 dimers swing away from Val48 and interact
with Arg8′. The inter-subunit ion pair formed by Arg8′
and Asp29 is critical for the dimer stability of HIV PR.28 PRS17 utilizes both residues involved
in this conserved ion pair to recognize and position P3 residue of
CA-p2 substrate.

shown in black, while those of P4′ Nle are shown in magenta.
(F) Difference in the binding of P4′ Nle between PR/CA-p2 dimer

bond present only in PRS17/CA-p2 is colored in green, and
the hydrogen bond present in the PR/CA-p2 complex alone is shown in
black dotted lines.

The new conformation
of P3 Arg forms additional van der Waals contacts
with Arg8′, Val48, Pro81′, and Ser82′ in PRS17 relative to those observed in the wild-type complex (Figure 4A). Also, the new
orientation of P3 Arg guanidine head forms water-mediated hydrogen
bonds with the hydroxyl side chain of Ser82′, which stabilizes
the conformation of P3 Arg. Further, the guanidine head of P3 Arg
in PRS17/CA-p2 forms a double water-mediated hydrogen bond
with the carbonyl oxygen of catalytic triad residue Gly27 and Asp29.
These internal structural waters are highly conserved in most HIV
PR structures, including the wild-type PR/CA-p2 complex. Similar interactions
are also observed for conformations 2 and 3 of P3 Arg in the second
dimer of PRS17/CA-p2 (Figure 4B). In conformation 2, the guanidine of P3
Arg forms stacking interaction with Arg8′ (Figure 4C), while the guanidine of
P3 Arg in conformation 3 forms van der Waals interaction with Arg8′
and hydrogen bond interaction with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen
of Pro81′ (Figure 4D). The P3 Arg conformation 3 in dimer 2 forms fewer van der
Waals contacts to Arg8′ than seen for conformation 1 in dimer
1. The guanidine head of P3 Arg in conformation 2 is buried deep in
the pocket and forms additional van der Waals contacts with Leu23′
that are not present in conformation 1 or 3. This conformation is
further held in place by a single water-mediated hydrogen bond between
P3 Arg guanidine head and Asp29, as well as another one to the main-chain
carbonyl of catalytic triad residue Gly27 of PRS17. In
contrast, conformation 3 forms double water-mediated hydrogen bonds
with Gly27 and Asp29. The guanidine head of both conformations 2 and
3 of P3 Arg in dimer 2 has a water-mediated hydrogen bond to the hydroxyl
of Ser82′, which further anchors P3 Arg of substrate analogue.
The V82′S mutation in PRS17 facilitates the new
conformation of P3 Arg side chain, since Val82′ in the wild-type
complex would sterically interfere with P3 Arg in this location. Mutations
of Val82 to Ala, Thr, Phe, Ile, Ser, and Leu are associated with resistance
to clinical HIV PR inhibitors.9,29 Similar to V82S mutation
in PRS17, V82A mutation is also expected to expand the
binding site for P3 Arg, but other larger and β-branched mutations
may block the access to this site. The co-occurrence of flap mutations
like G48V that block P3 substrate-binding site and large substitutions
at residue 82 like V82F, V82L, and V82I that block the alternate P3
binding site are expected to be detrimental to PR activity. In the
previously solved crystal structure of PRV82A/CA-p2, the
substrate analogue is in two alternate conformations related by 180°
with 0.65/0.35 occupancies as opposed to a single conformation in
the current PR and PRS17 complexes. The major conformation
of P3 Arg in the PRV82A/CA-p2 complex forms van der Waals
contact with Phe53 in the second strand of the flaps similar to the
PR/CA-p2 complex, while the carbonyl of P4′ Nle of the minor
conformation related by 180° occupies the P3 Arg site observed
in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex (Figure 4E). Similar to V82S, V82A mutation opens
up the S3 site for substrate recognition. Thus, in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex, the G48V flap mutation in conjunction with the V82S
mutation facilitates the binding of the side chain of P3 Arg in the
new site. The effect of Val82 mutation appears to be two-fold; it
alters the resistance profile of PR inhibitors and regulates the access
to Arg8/8′ in the recognition of substrate P3 residue in response
to resistance flap mutations like G48V that hinder substrate recognition.

Effects of G48′V Mutation on Binding of CA-p2 P4′
Nle to Leu76′ Hydrophobic Pocket
Comparison of PR
and PRS17 complexes with CA-p2 reveals significant differences
in the binding of P4′ Nle. In the wild-type PR/CA-p2 complex,
the terminal P5′ NH2 group forms a hydrogen bond
interaction with the main-chain carbonyl of Leu46 and van der Waals
interactions with Phe53 in the second strand of the flap (Figure 4F). However, in the
mutant PRS17/CA-p2 complex, the introduction of G48V mutation
causes the Phe53 side chain to rotate out by more than 140° in
comparison to the wild-type complex. The G48V mutation further contributes
to more than 1.5 Å shift in the position of terminal P5′
NH2, which loses van der Waals contact with Phe53 but retains
the hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of Leu46. The main-chain amide
of P4′ Nle is moved by ∼0.8 Å in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex in comparison to that in the wild-type complex, which
results in a new long hydrogen bond (∼3.5 vs ∼4.1 Å
in the PR/CA-p2 complex) between the main-chain amide of P4′
Nle and the side chain of Asp29′ in dimer 1. P4′ Nle
amide in dimer 2 forms a water-mediated hydrogen bond with Asp29′
and a new long hydrogen bond with the side chain of Asp30′
(∼3.5 vs ∼3.8 Å). The Cα atom of P4′
Nle is also shifted by ∼1.2 and 0.5 Å in comparison to
its position in PR/CA-p2 in dimers 1 and 2, respectively. Along with
the shift in the main-chain atoms, the side chain of P4′ Nle
in dimer 1 swings into the hydrophobic pocket around Leu76′
and forms a hydrophobic interaction with the side chain of Leu76′.
The side chain of Lys45′, which occupies this pocket and has
van der Waals contacts with Asp30′ in the wild-type PR/CA-p2
structure, swings away to form a van der Waals interaction with the
Gln58′ side chain in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex, thereby
enabling P4′ Nle of CA-p2 to interact with Leu76′. P4′
Nle bound in this pocket also forms van der Waals interactions with
Asp30′, Lys45′, and Gln58′ in the mutant. In
contrast, the P4′ Nle side chain in wild-type complex shows
van der Waals contact with only one residue, Lys45′. The P4′
Nle side chain in the second dimer of PRS17/CA-p2 also
binds in the same pocket with similar interactions due to the G48′V
flap mutation in PRS17. Thus, the G48′V mutation
in the flap and the altered conformation of Phe53′ in the PRS17/CA-p2 complex induce a shift in P4′ Nle side chain
away from the flaps to form a new hydrogen bond with Asp29′
or Asp30′. Further, the side chain of P4′ Nle in the
new orientation binds in the hydrophobic pocket near Leu76′
with added van der Waals contacts. Overall, this new arrangement in
the mutant confers favorable interactions with P4′ Nle.

Mutation
V82S Mediates Enhanced Binding of P3′ Arg in
p2-NC
PRS17 in complex with p2-NC was crystallized
in two different space groups P41 and P61 and refined to resolutions of 1.71 and 1.67
Å, respectively. Both structures have one PRS17 dimer
per asymmetric unit and a single conformation of substrate analogue
bound at the active-site cavity. The two structures are very similar
with an RMSD of 0.5 Å for 198 equiv Cα atoms. The previously
solved PR/p2-NC complex can be superposed with the PRS17-P41/p2-NC and PRS17-P61/p2-NC complexes with RMSD
values of 0.99 and 0.96 Å, respectively, for the 198 equivalent
Cα atoms. Despite their different space groups, both structures
exhibit a maximum deviation of more than 4.3 Å at the same residue,
Asp35, in comparison to the wild-type structure. The conformation
of P2, P1, P1′, P2′, and P4′ residues of p2-NC
and their interactions with PRS17 residues are similar
for the PRS17/p2-NC complexes in the two space groups and
PR/p2-NC. However, noticeable differences occur at residues P3′,
P3, and P4 of PRS17-P41/p2-NC and PRS17-P61/p2-NC in comparison to PR/p2-NC.

Unlike the P3 Arg of the
PR/CA-p2 complex, the P3′ Arg of PR/p2-NC binds in the space
between Arg8 and Val82 (Figure 5A). The side chain of P3′ Arg forms van der Waals contacts
with Arg8 and the Cδ2 side-chain atom of Val82. In both PRS17-P41/p2-NC and PRS17-P61/p2-NC
complexes, the P3′ Arg binds in the same pocket albeit the
guanidine head of P3′ Arg is tilted toward V82S mutation due
to the lack of a β-branched Cδ atom in residue 82. The
Nε2 atom of the guanidine head of P3′ Arg in PRS17 complexes is shifted by 1.0 Å (PRS17-P41/p2-NC)
and 1.2 Å (PRS17-P61/p2-NC) toward V82S in
comparison to the PR/p2-NC complex. The loss of β-branched side
chain in V82S mutation results in a significant shift of 80’s
loop residues toward Arg8 in PRS17 complexes. The Cα
atoms of residues Thr80, Pro81, and V82S are shifted by 1.1, 1.3,
and 0.7 Å, respectively, for the PRS17-P41/p2-NC
complex and 1.3, 1.4, and 0.6 Å for the PRS17-P61/p2-NC complex from the corresponding Cα atoms in the PR/p2-NC
complex (Figure 5A).
This shift contracts the binding pocket for P3′ Arg of p2-NC
by 1.3 and 1.4 Å, as measured by the distance between the guanidine
head Nη1 of Arg8 and the Cα atom of Pro81, in PRS17-P41/p2-NC and PRS17-P61/p2-NC in comparison to the
wild-type complex. This narrowing of the pocket results in the enhanced
binding of P3′ Arg as it is able to form a new hydrogen bond
interaction with the main-chain carbonyl of Pro81 in addition to van
der Waals interactions with the side chain of Pro81 in the PRS17/p2-NC complexes. In contrast, P3′ Arg in the wild-type
PR/p2-NC complex has no interaction with Pro81. Both mutant PRS17/p2-NC complexes retain the extensive van der Waals contacts
between the Arg8 of PRS17 and P3′ Arg of substrate
analogue seen in the wild-type complex. Similar shifting of 80’s
loop residues is also observed in the P3 pocket of both dimers of
the PRS17/CA-p2 complex in comparison to the wild-type
structure, although the shifts are reduced by half ranging from 0.3
to 0.5 Å, likely due to the two alternate conformations of P3
Arg bound in this pocket. Thus, the analysis of the three PRS17 substrate analogue complexes indicates that the loss of β-branched
side chain by V82S mutation initiates the shifting of 80’s
loop and reshapes the S3/S3′ subsite for enhanced binding and
interactions with P3/P3′.

bond interactions between DRV and PRS17 are shown in dotted
lines. For the sake of clarity, water-mediated hydrogen bonds between
DRV and the flaps are omitted.

G48V Mutation of PRS17 Results in Altered Binding
Position of P3 and P4 Residues of p2-NC and Addition of Two New Hydrogen
Bonds
The P3 Thr in both PRS17-P41/p2-NC
and PRS17-P61/p2-NC complexes exhibits significant
structural changes in comparison to the wild-type complex. The p2-NC
main-chain carbonyl oxygen of P3 Thr occupies identical positions
in all three structures. The hydrogen bond observed between the P3
carbonyl and the main-chain amide of Asp29 in the PR/p2-NC complex,
as well as the conserved water-mediated hydrogen bonds between the
P3 carbonyl and Gly27 and Asp29, is preserved in both PRS17/p2-NC complexes. However, the larger G48V mutation in PRS17 complexes induces shifts in P3 Thr Cα and Cβ atoms by
∼0.7 and 1.8 Å in comparison to their corresponding positions
in the PR/p2-NC complex (Figure 5B). In this new conformation, the P3 Thr side chain
forms several van der Waals contacts with the side chains of G48V
mutation and Arg8′ in PRS17 complexes. It also forms
a hydrogen bond interaction with Arg8′ side chain in both the
complexes. In contrast, P3 Thr side chain in the wild-type PR/p2-NC
complex forms a lone van der Waals contact with Arg8′ side
chain but no hydrogen bonds. In comparison to the wild-type complex,
the main-chain amide nitrogen of P3 Thr in both PRS17/p2-NC
complexes is rotated about ∼160° along the main-chain
Cα–C bond. This results in a shift of the amide nitrogen
of P3 Thr in both mutant complexes by ∼2.8 Å from the
corresponding position in the PR/p2-NC complex. The amide nitrogen
of P3 Thr forms a hydrogen bond interaction with the carbonyl oxygen
of Gly48 in the wild-type PR/p2-NC complex, while it interacts with
the side chain of Asp29 in both PRS17/p2-NC complexes.

The terminal P4 Ace residue of p2-NC exhibits the maximum deviations
among the substrate analogue residues in both PRS17 complexes
in comparison to PR/p2-NC. The P4 residue in the PRS17 cannot
occupy the same pocket as in the wild-type structure due to steric
hindrance from G48V mutation and the loss of interaction with Val82′
as a result of V82′S mutation. The P4 Cα is shifted by
∼4.6 Å in both complexes from its position in the wild-type
complex. Due to G48V mutation inducing ∼160° of rotation
along the Cα–C bond of P3 residue, the P4 Ace residue
occupies a different binding pocket in PRS17 complexes
to that observed in the wild-type structure. The P4 residue in the
wild-type PR/p2-NC complex forms van der Waals contacts with Gly48,
Gly49, Pro81, and Val82. In contrast, the P4 residue in the PRS17/p2-NC complexes has van der Waals contacts with a different
set of residues: Val48, Asp29, Asp30, Lys45, and Ile47. In addition,
the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of the P4 residue in PRS17 complexes forms new hydrogen bond interaction with the main-chain
amide of Val48. Thus, despite large shifts in P3 and P4 residues induced
by the G48V mutation, PRS17 accommodates the substrate
residues in alternate sites and gains two hydrogen bond interactions.
The new hydrogen bonds observed in the PRS17/p2-NC complexes
likely contribute to the improved p2-NC substrate analogue inhibition
constant observed for PRS17 compared to those in PR.

PRS17 Binds Substrate Analogues CA-p2, p2-NC, and
Inhibitor DRV without Drastic Change in PR Conformation around the
Active Site
The two dimers of the PRS17/CA-p2
complex together with the PRS17-P41/p2-NC and PRS17-P61/p2-NC structures can be superposed with PRS17/DRV complex with an RMSD of 0.4–0.7 Å. No dramatic
changes are observed in the conformation of residues around the active-site
catalytic triad and the binding of substrate analogues and inhibitor
(Figure 5C). Most of
the conformational changes are seen in the flap residues. The serine
side chain of V82S mutation in both monomers of PRS17/DRV
has two alternate conformations mimicking the two β-branches
of valine, while in the substrate analogue complexes, it has a single
conformation that points away from Arg8 to accommodate the substrate
residues. Side-chain rotamer changes are observed in Phe53 and in
mutated side chains of Leu46 and Val48 in complexes with DRV and the
two substrate analogues. In addition, shifts are observed for flap
residues. A shift of 0.8 Å in M46L is observed in PRS17/CA-p2 in comparison to complex with DRV. Similarly, Val48 of PRS17 shifts by 0.6 Å when bound to p2-NC analogue in comparison
to its position in the complex with DRV. Flap mutations M46L, G48V,
and I54V in PRS17 are implicated in the curling of flaps
observed in the inhibitor-free structure.16 In PRS17/DRV complex, M46L and G48V mutations are shown
to synergistically alter the conformation of Phe53 by steric hindrance
underlying the relationship between the three residues.16 Through changes in the flap strands including
the position of M46L or G48V in combination with the change in rotamer
for side chains of Leu46, Val48, and Phe53, PRS17 binds
substrate analogues as tightly as it binds DRV (Ki = 50 nM). The larger side chain of the G48V mutation
in the S2 pocket may play an important role in the better inhibition
constant (Ki = 11 nM) of APV for PRS17. Thermodynamic integration and molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann
surface area studies have shown that the larger side chain introduced
by G48V mutation strengthens van der Waals interactions with APV.30 However, G48V together with M46L also alters
the conformation of other flap residues like Phe53 as seen in PRS17/DRV complex,16 which may affect
the inhibitor binding. Thus, minimal structural changes enable highly
drug-resistant PRS17 to bind substrate analogues with similar
affinity as for DRV and better than for the other clinical inhibitors,
contributing to both viral fitness and drug resistance.

Discussion
Our studies on PRS17 demonstrate the value of using
machine learning on genotype–phenotype data to select informative
mutants for further analysis. Among the 17 mutations in PRS17, G48V and V82S play critical roles in the binding of CA-p2 and p2-NC
substrate analogues. The active-site cavity around Val82 is important
for the binding of PR substrates, as well as clinical inhibitors.
Drug-resistant mutations of Val82 are reported for all clinical PR
inhibitors except for DRV.9 The side chains
of mutations vary in size from the smaller V82A to bulkier V82F in
addition to V82S, V82T, V82L, and V82I that are in between.9 V82A is one of the earlier PR mutations to occur
at the active site among patients undergoing antiviral therapy31 and has been the best-studied mutation at position
82. Kinetic studies have shown that PR bearing the single V82A mutation
has a significantly worse affinity for PR inhibitors indinavir, nelfinavir,
ritonavir, and DRV, while smaller effects were seen for the cleavage
of PR substrate.32−35 Structural studies on V82A mutant in complexes with nelfinavir,
indinavir, ritonavir, DRV, and saquinavir all reveal a small shift
in residues to accommodate the inhibitor, explaining the cross-resistance
profile of this mutation to all PR inhibitors.36,37 Resistance mutations like V82A at the active site of HIV PR interfere
with the binding of drugs; however, replication of the virus requires
successful binding and hydrolysis of Gag and Gag-Pol substrates by
resistant PR variants. Crystal structures of inactivated PR with active-site
D25N and V82A mutations in complex with substrates CA-p2, p1-p6, and
MA-CA show high structural similarity with inactivated PR-D25N/substrate
complexes,38 which indicates that V82A
mutation in conjunction with active-site D25N does not affect substrate
binding. However, mutations in the Gag substrate cleavage sites can
coevolve with resistance-associated mutations in HIV PR or mutations
that alter the fitness of HIV PR.39−42 NC-p1 cleavage site, which is
the rate-limiting step in Gag polyprotein processing,43 has been reported to coevolve with Ala to Val mutation
at the P2 position of the substrate in response to V82A-resistant
mutation.40,44,45

Mutations
in the flap region also alter the PR susceptibility to
inhibitors. In particular, flap mutation G48V confers a high level
of resistance to saquinavir.46 G48V mutation
is also selected by PR inhibitors atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir,
and nelfinavir.46−48 G48M has a similar resistance profile as G48V.46 Less prevalent resistance mutations G48A/S/T/Q
are less well studied and their clinical significance is not fully
understood.49 Most of the Gly48 mutations
occur in viruses with multiple PI-resistant sequences49 like PRS17. G48V is associated with V82A in
saquinavir resistance50,51 and this pair occurs as a mutational
cluster together with nonactive-site mutant C95F, which emphasizes
the importance of coevolution of mutations at 48 and 82 in drug resistance.
Mutations at 48 and 82 together with those at 30, 84, and 90 are considered
primary mutations that are necessary for inhibitor resistance.52 The present structural study reveals that PRS17, a multidrug-resistant PR harboring primary mutations at
48 and 82 in addition to others, recognizes substrate analogues CA-p2
and p2-NC in an altered fashion in comparison to wild-type structures.
The crystal structure of unliganded PRS17-D25N exhibits
curling of flap tips in comparison to unliganded wild-type structure.
This flap curling is initiated by G48V mutation with a ∼172°
change in ϕ angle in comparison to PR wild type and extends
up to Gly52′. In addition to G48V, other flap mutations M46L
and I54V may also contribute to curling in PRS17. Identical
flap curling was observed in the recent unliganded PRS17 crystal structure.16 Also, solution studies
of PRS17-D25N by NMR demonstrated that the inhibitor-free
PRS17-D25N adopts a flap conformation very similar to that
of the inhibitor-free active PRS17 crystal structure. The
current crystal structure of PRS17-D25N further confirms
that the conformation changes observed in the flaps of the two unliganded
structures of PRS17 are due to the mutations. Curling or
twisting of flaps in the PR structures due to mutations in the flaps
is implicated in the altered resistance profile of the mutant PR.
F53L single mutant, which exhibits curled flaps, was shown to possess
a 15% lower catalytic efficiency and a 20-fold weaker inhibition by
clinical drug indinavir.53 Twisting of
flaps observed in the recently reported PR with 22 mutations in addition
to inactivating D25N mutation has >175-fold resistance to DRV in
addition
to APV.54 The flap twisting initiated by
G48V mutation in PRS17 is implicated in the cross-resistance
of PRS17 to multiple clinical drugs including DRV even
though it lacks any major mutations associated with DRV resistance.16

Although the binding site for P3 Arg of
CA-p2 in the current PR/CA-p2
complex is partly exposed to solvent, P3 Arg interacts with flap residue
Phe53 in a manner similar to that seen in the CA-p2 complexes with
PR (4EP3), PRV82A (2AOE), and inactive PR-D25NV82A (1MT8). With P3 Arg bound at the preferred
wild-type flap-binding site, mutations at 82 with large side chains
like V82F, V82I, or V82L hinder the binding of PR inhibitors, thereby
altering PR susceptibility to PIs while retaining binding to substrates.
The G48V mutation in PRS17 also confers resistance to PR
inhibitors16 and blocks the flap-binding
site for P3 Arg of CA-p2 observed in the various wild-type PR complexes.
However, V82/82′S mutation in PRS17 results in ∼1
Å shift in the residues of the 80’s loop and rearrangement
of the S3/S3′ pocket between V82/82′S and the conserved
Arg8′/8. Both P3 Arg of CA-p2 and P3′ Arg of p2-NC bind
in this subsite of PRS17 with enhanced interactions including
a new direct hydrogen bond, water-mediated hydrogen bonds and van
der Waals contacts to the 80’s loop that are absent in the
corresponding wild-type structures. This alternate binding site for
P3/P3′ substrate residues is particularly critical for PR fitness
when resistance mutations like G48/48′V are present at the
flaps. The G48/48′V mutation also alters the binding of P4′
Nle of CA-p2, as well as P3 Thr and P4 Ace residues of p2-NC substrate
analogues.

The enhanced binding of CA-p2 and p2-NC substrate
analogues with
new hydrogen bond interactions observed in PRS17 complexes
in comparison to PR complexes agrees well with 3.4- and 4.2-fold better Ki values for PRS17 relative to those
for the wild-type enzyme. In addition, the comparison of PRS17 substrate analogue complexes with that of DRV reveals that highly
multiple drug-resistant PRS17 efficiently binds substrate
analogues and DRV with minimal conformational changes, thereby contributing
to both viral fitness and drug resistance. The current structural
studies of PRS17 strongly suggest that G48V mutation plays
an important role in the enhanced binding of substrate analogues CA-p2
and p2-NC. Further, the size of the mutated side chain selected at
residue 82 may be influenced by the presence of mutation at the flap
residue Gly48. In the absence of G48V mutation, Val82 mutations enhance
the resistance profile of PR through steric hindrance to inhibitors
at the binding site. However, in the presence of G48V flap mutation,
mutations of residue 82 to larger side chains like V82F, V82L, and
V82I may interfere with the binding of substrates, while smaller V82S
and V82A mutations might play a vital role in both enhanced binding
of substrate and increased resistance to PIs through the structural
shift of 80’s loop. The structural features identified in the
current studies reveal valuable information for the future design
of drugs targeting multidrug-resistant HIV PRs. Clearly, further studies
on substrate recognition by multidrug-resistant PR variants will bring
out new ways of targeting viral fitness and activity.

Materials and
Methods
Construction, Expression, and Purification of PRS17
Synthetic genes encoding the 99 amino acid protein named
PRS17 and its active-site mutant PRS17-D25N
(DNA2.0, Menlo Park, CA) were cloned in pJ414 vector flanked by Nde1
and BamHI sites and transformed into Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3, Stratagene). DNA sequencing
and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry were used to verify
the recombinant construct. Protein expression, purification, and refolding
were carried out as described previously.55,56 In brief, cells were expressed in Luria-Bertani medium and induced
with 2 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside. The
harvested cells were lysed by the addition of lysozyme (100 μg/mL)
and sonication at 4°C. The pelleted inclusion bodies were washed
and solubilized in 50 mM Tris–HCL, pH 8.0, 8 M guanidine hydrochloride,
5 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and 10 mM dithiothreitol.
The protein was purified over a Superdex-75 column (HiLoad 2.6 cm
× 60 cm, GE HealthCare) under denaturing conditions. The peak
fractions were further purified by reverse-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography on a SOURCE 15RPC ST 4.6/100 column using AKTA
pure chromatography system (GE HealthCare). The purified protein was
refolded by extensive dialysis against 30 mM formic acid and concentrated
to the desired level using Amicon Ultra concentrators.

Kinetic Inhibition
Measurements
Kinetic inhibition
values (Ki) of p2-NC and CA-p2 for PRS17 were measured using a spectroscopic fluorescence resonance
energy-transfer (FRET) substrate analogue of the p2-NC site (H-2992,
Bachem, Bubendorf, Switzerland). The peptide sequences of the two
substrate analogues are R-V-L-r-F-E-A-Nle for CA-p2 and Ace-T-I-Nle-r-Nle-Q-R
p2-NC. Enzyme kinetic parameters kcat and Km were determined for PRS17 using
the Michaelis–Menten analysis at 14–180 μM substrate
concentration [S]. The kcat and Km are 69.7 ± 14.4 min–1 and 143 ± 33.0 μM, respectively. The kcat/Km for PRS17 of 0.49 ± 0.05 min–1 μM–1 is comparable to the previously reported values, using a different
method (0.55 min–1 μM–1).15 Reactions were performed in a total volume of
100 μL at 37 °C in 50 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic
acid pH 5.6, 200 mM sodium chloride, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 2.5% glycerol.
Enzyme concentration [E] was 180–370 nM as measured by active-site
titration with APV. Inhibition assays used 60 μM [S]. The rate
of substrate cleavage under a range of substrate analogue concentrations
was measured continuously for 5 min by excitation at 340 nm and emission
at 420 nm using a POLARstar OPTIMA microplate reader. The Ki value was determined using the equation Ki = (IC50 – [E]/2)/(1 + [S]/Km). IC50 was determined from dose–response
curves. Km values of FRET substrate for
PRS17 were determined from the Michaelis–Menten
analysis at 14–180 μM [S]. All calculations were fitted
using Sigmaplot 12.0 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA).

Crystallization
PRS17 was complexed with
substrate analogues CA-p2 and p2-NC dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
at a 1:5 molar ratio and incubated on ice for 30 min. The complex
was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min, and the supernatant
was used for crystallization. The crystallization trials were performed
at room temperature with the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique.
The hanging drop in all crystallization trials was set up with 1 μL
of protein solution (5 mg/mL) and 1 μL of reservoir solution.
Crystals of inhibitor-free PRS17-D25N were obtained from
1.95 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M bis–Tris pH 7.5. Crystals
of PRS17/CA-p2 were grown from reservoir solution containing
2.1 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic
acid at pH 7.6. The PRS17 crystals in complex with substrate
analogue p2-NC were obtained in two different space groups P41 and P61. The
well solution used for growing PRS17-P41/p2-NC crystals
was 29.5% poly(ethylene glycol) 4000, 0.2 M ammonium acetate, and
0.1 M sodium acetate buffer at pH 4.6. The PRS17-P61/p2-NC crystals were grown from 35% Tacsimate, pH 7.0 (Hampton Research
Corp., Aliso Viejo, CA). Tacsimate contains 1.83 M malonic acid, 0.25
M ammonium citrate tribasic, 0.12 M succinic acid, 0.3 M dl-malic acid, 0.4 M sodium acetate trihydrate, 0.5 M sodium formate,
and 0.16 M ammonium tartrate dibasic. Crystals of the wild-type PR/CA-p2
were obtained from 1 M sodium chloride and 0.1 M sodium acetate at
pH 4.8. The crystals were cryo-cooled with cryoprotectant containing
the respective mother liquor together with 30% glycerol.

X-ray Data
Collection and Structure Determination
X-ray
diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline 22-ID of the
Southeast Regional Collaborative Access Team (SER-CAT) at the Advanced
Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. The data were integrated
and scaled with HKL2000.57 The crystal
structures of PRS17 active-site mutant PRS17-D25N and the substrate analogue complexes PR/CA-p2, PRS17/CA-p2, PRS17-P41/p2-NC, and PRS17-P61/p2-NC were solved by molecular replacement using PHASER.58,59 The previously solved crystal structure of active PRS17 (5T2E)16 was used as the starting model for PRS17 active-site mutant PRS17-D25N. For PR/CA-p2 substrate
analogue complex, the crystal structure of PR/p2-NC24 (2AOD) was used as the starting model. For PRS17/CA-p2 substrate
analogue complex, the crystal structure of PRS17 complex
with darunavir (DRV)16 (5T2Z) was used as the
initial model. Crystal structure of multiple mutants V6 in complex
with indinavir (1SGU)60 was used to solve both PRS17/p2-NC complexes. The PR/CA-p2 complex was refined with SHELX-1997.61 The PRS17/CA-p2 complex was refined
using REFMAC,62 while the PRS17-D25N and PRS17/p2-NC complexes were initially refined
by SHELX-201463 and switched to REFMAC
during later cycles of refinement. COOT64 was used for most model building except O65 was applied for PR/CA-p2. In the PRS17/p2-NC complexes,
mutations were added to the model based on the primary sequence and
difference density maps. The substrate analogues were fitted into
unambiguous electron density in the four complex structures. Solvent
molecules were inserted at stereochemically reasonable positions using
2Fo–Fc and Fo–Fc maps at 1σ and 3σ levels, respectively. Molecular
figures were prepared with PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org).
