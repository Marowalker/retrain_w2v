To
increase the biobased content of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET), up to 30 wt % poly(lactic acid) (PLA) was blended with PET
using twin-screw compounding and injection molding processes. Multifunctional
epoxide compatibilizers including a chain extender and an impact toughening
agent were used as blend modifiers to improve the poor mechanical
properties of PET/PLA blends. The mechanical and thermodynamic performances
were investigated along with the morphological features through scanning
electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and interfacial tension
determination. From rheological and differential scanning calorimetry
results, it was observed that the molecular weight of both PET and
PLA increased with compatibilizers because of epoxide reactions. The
toughening agent, poly(ethylene-n-butylene-acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (EBA–GMA), provided a 292%
increase in impact strength over the blend but reduced modulus by
25%. In contrast, 0.7 phr addition of the chain extender, poly(styrene-acrylic−co-glycidyl methacrylate) (SA−GMA), yielded comparable
performance to that of neat PET without sacrificing the tensile and
flexural properties. When both compatibilizers were present in the
blend, the mechanical properties remained relatively unaltered or
decreased with increasing EBA–GMA content. The differences
in mechanical performance observed were considered in relation to
the strengthening mechanism of the two differing compatibilizers and
their effects on the miscibility of the blend.

==== Body
Introduction
Biobased products are
of high importance when considering climate
change mitigation, greenhouse gas emission, and sequestration. This
is because carbon absorbed by plants is used to produce biobased products,
which is then released at the end of the product life cycle (so-called
“green carbon”) without increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. In contrast, fossil-based products use fossil
(“black”) carbon, which was previously stored underground
and releases additional CO2 into the atmosphere.1

Under this consensus, biobased polymers
have been a research hotspot
in recent years. Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the
most commercially used thermoplastics and is found in products such
as drink bottles, food packaging, automotive parts, household goods,
and electronics.2 PET is a clear thermoplastic
with good barrier, stiffness, strength, and chemical resistance.3 The complete worldwide use of PET has expanded
from 11.8 million metric tons in 1997 to 54 million tons in 2010.4 However, by 2013 only 0.6 million tons was bio-PET,
which contains 20% biobased carbon derived from biobased ethylene
glycol.5 Even though 100% bio-PET has been
produced under the “Plant PET Technology Collaborative”
launched by The Coca-Cola Company, it will still take time before
its production surpasses the production of conventional PET and its
adoption goes beyond the packaging sector.

Poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) is 100% biobased and the best-established
biobased thermoplastic polymer. In addition, PLA is available at comparable
prices to those of fossil-derived thermoplastics.5 To achieve good mechanical performance and high biocarbon
content, a large number of studies have been reported by blending
different polymers (e.g., natural rubber) with PLA.6−9 Similarly, blending PET with PLA
would be an easier way to significantly increase the biobased component
ratio and to have a competitive cost at the current technological
level. As there is only a small price difference between PET and PLA
($1.97 and $2.11 US per kg, respectively, in July 2017)10 and with the demand for biopolymers growing
and PLA being the most-prevalent biobased thermoplastic in the market,
the price point of this resin will soon be on par with PET as the
production costs reduce for the bulk synthesis of PLA. Previous studies
with PET have included up to 40 wt % PLA in melt compounding, with
most research focused on less than 20 wt %. However, these polymer
blends show inferior mechanical performances because of the high loading
of PLA in PET, making it unattractive to the industry due to reductions
of 80% in impact strength, 50% in tensile strength, and 60% in elongation
at both 20 and 40 wt % of PLA in a PET matrix.11−14 The main two reasons for these
reductions are as follows: (a) the processing temperature of PET (∼260–300
°C), which is well above the melting temperature of PLA (∼160
°C), triggering the PLA decomposition15−17 and chain scission13 during blend compounding and (b) the immiscibility
of the two polymers, which has been reported even for blends containing
only small amounts of PLA (5 wt %).12,13 Yuryev et
al. found that PLA was supertoughened using poly(ethylene-n-butylene-acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate)
(EBA–GMA) (Figure 1a) through reactive compatibilization in the presence of an
epoxy-based chain extender (Figure 1b) at temperatures greater than 250 °C.18 The authors noted that the epoxy groups in EBA–GMA
react with hydroxyl and carboxylic groups of PLA and form a micelle
structure as a nucleation center. Additionally, styrene-acrylic–GMA
(SA–GMA) aided in reducing the thermal degradation effects
of PLA by means of a similar epoxide reaction. The same theory was
applied in a propylene carbonate (PC)/PLA blend, and the impact strength
was increased more than 10 times compared with that of blends without
these epoxides.19 However, a PET/PLA blend
is quite a different case because PC has very limited reactivity with
epoxides,20 while PET and PLA (polyesters)
show higher reactivity and compete to react with both EBA–GMA
and SA–GMA, which leads to uncertainty in the performance and
the effect the compatibilizers have on the PET/PLA blend system.

In this study, up to 30 wt % PLA, considered a relatively
large
amount as it is higher than that of other reports except for some
specimens with very poor performance, was added into a PET matrix
to obtain a product with greater biobased carbon content than that
of PET alone. Both EBA–GMA and SA–GMA were employed
to improve the properties of PET/PLA blends at minimal levels to maintain
as much biobased content in the final formulations. Considering the
same functional groups (epoxy groups) with a possibility to generate
PET–EBA–GMA–PLA and PET–SA–GMA–PLA
(Figure 1c), both were
treated as compatibilizers. Comparison of their effects was also illustrated
from morphological observations as well as mechanical and thermodynamic
measurements.

Results and Discussion
Morphological Observations
Blending of two different
polymers tends to result in compatibility issues, and poor miscibility
between continuous and dispersed phases results in inferior mechanical
properties. Therefore, morphologies of PET/PLA blends were compared
using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The images of PET/PLA blends
without a compatibilizer are shown in Figure 2. Because of the ultrahigh processing temperature
for PLA, T90 displays small PLA droplets with an average diameter
of 1.5 μm and the size increases to 2.3 μm for T80. In
these formulations, the interface does not show a distinct boundary,
which relates to their sufficiently close values of Hansen solubility
parameters (21.5 and 22.6 for PLA and PET, respectively).25 In addition, the effects of transesterification
between PET and PLA chains cannot be ignored. The decomposed PLA during
processing exposed extra carboxyl and hydroxyl end groups, which can
react with the acyl oxygen of PET to generate PET–PLA chains
(Figure S1). Thus, the PET–PLA chains
improve their compatibility.26 When PLA
increased to 30%, the cross section shows a large average particle
size of 3.6 μm with a wide size distribution as the coalescence
opportunities of PLA droplets increase.

b) neat PET, (c, d) T90, (e, f) T80, (g,

Figures 3–5 show
the morphologies of PET/PLA
blends compatibilized with EBA–GMA, SA–GMA, and both,
respectively. The effects of different compatibilizers were easily
distinguished. With an increasing EBA–GMA amount, the cross-sectional
surfaces become rougher. These rough areas were occupied by the new
generated micelles from EBA–GMA, where the long ethylene chains
aggregated in the micelle center and the epoxy groups outside connected
to PET and/or PLA.18 In contrast to the
EBA–GMA system, the newly generated PET–SA–GMA–PLA
in PET/PLA/SA–GMA blends increased the compatibility between
PET and PLA. As a result, the increasing addition of SA–GMA
largely decreased the droplet sizes of incompatible PLA. It is worth
noting that the PET/PLA phases transfer to co-continuous phases when
the SA–GMA amount is greater than 0.7 phr, where the PLA phase
is etched by the electron beam. It indicates that PLA molecules were
all associated with PET–SA–GMA–PLA chains and
further connected to the PET phase. Thus, the PET and PLA regions
were continuously distributed along PET–SA–GMA–PLA
chains and formed co-continuous phases. In addition, this morphology
indicates that both components can enhance the mechanical properties
of the system.27 Therefore, the SA–GMA
amount was fixed at 0.7 phr and the introduction of different amounts
of EBA–GMA in PET/PLA blends was tested. However, the co-continuous
phases were disturbed by the EBA–GMA micelles because of the
reactions competition of epoxy groups in both compatibilizers with
hydroxyl/carboxylic groups in the polyesters.

To further evaluate the miscibility
of PET/PLA blends, contact
angles were measured and subsequent surface tensions and interfacial
tensions were calculated, as seen in Table 1. It was observed that the contact angle
for PET was the smallest when subjected to both water and diiodomethane.
Next, PLA was found to have a contact angle in the low 60° range
for both polar and nonpolar liquids showing slightly less affinity
than that of PET, while EBA–GMA had a hydrophobic characteristic
to it with regards to the water droplet contact angle and an organophilic
nature when diiodomethane was present on its surface. These differing
liquid affinities resulted in the calculated surface tensions for
the individual polymers that were extrapolated to the processing temperature.
The polar components are similar for both PET and PLA, while EBA–GMA
demonstrates almost no polar portion. For the dispersive components,
PET and EBA–GMA are comparable with values of 18 mN m–1 while the PLA is approximately half this value. For the polymers’
overall surface tensions, they had a descending magnitude starting
from PET to PLA with the lowest sum found for EBA–GMA, implying
that the two polyesters have a greater surface energy than that of
EBA–GMA. After computation of the interfacial tension between
the constituent polymers, PET and PLA have the smallest value referring
to preferential miscibility between them over EBA–GMA. This
infers that the PLA chains will tend to form droplets within the PET
matrix phase. On the contrary, EBA–GMA will remain immiscible
in the blends when present, though PET is expected to act as an intermediate
between EBA–GMA and PLA because of the slightly lower interfacial
tension compared to that of PLA/EBA–GMA. However, both polyesters
will still vie for epoxide reactivity during extrusion that may alter
the final morphology of the blend systems by providing more attraction
between the different constituents.

To provide morphological data of samples prior to a mechanical
test, atomic force microscopy (AFM) was conducted with four of the
blends, as depicted in Figure 6. From the initial image of the T70 blend, there are areas
of elongated and varying sized PLA regions within the PET matrix,
emphasizing nonuniformity of the minor phase and a lack of miscibility
(Figure 6a). Upon the
introduction of SA–GMA at 0.7 phr, the PLA regimes are more
strandlike and show signs of co-continuous features along with a reduction
in the size of the dispersed droplets (Figure 6b), as seen with SEM. As for the blend containing
EBA–GMA at 10.5 wt % (Figure 6c), there remain globular PLA zones throughout the
PET matrix, with EBA–GMA dispersed randomly throughout the
blend. For the combination of the two compatibilizers (Figure 6d), the observed architecture
resembles that of the SA–GMA sample with PLA close to co-continuity.
EBA–GMA in this blend is then situated at the boundaries of
PET and PLA as the reacted epoxide groups help with miscibility of
the base polymers causing EBA–GMA to preferentially situate
at interfacial sections, though these are still scattered haphazardly
throughout the blend.

Mechanical Properties
The tensile properties and impact
performances of several PET/PLA blends are shown in Figures 7 and 8, where all specimens were obtained at the processing temperature
of 270 °C, except neat PLA at 190 °C. The remainder of the
mechanical results for all samples along with the flexural properties
are reported in Table S1 in the Supporting
Information. Following the mixing rule, both the tensile and flexural
strength/modulus slowly increased with the addition of PLA, while
the notched impact strength and elongation at break dramatically decreased,
indicating a brittle performance of PET/PLA blends without a compatibilizer.
The impact strength of PET/PLA blends was improved using EBA–GMA,
but the elongation at break was still low even when compatibilized
with 14% EBA–GMA. Interestingly, the addition of a small amount
of SA–GMA was able to recover the impact strength and elongation
at break even at 0.3 phr and reach the highest values of 30.1 J m–1 impact strength and 125.4% elongation at break at
0.7 phr, which is similar to the performance of neat PET without sacrificing
the tensile and flexural properties. Furthermore, the blend properties
of PET/PLA/SA–GMA do not show notable improvement with the
assistance of EBA–GMA, indicating that SA–GMA is more
effective in PET/PLA blends.

Regarding the thermomechanical
performance of the blends, there
is an incremental decrease in the heat deflection temperature (HDT)
as PLA is added, as illustrated in Table 2, which is due to the glass transition temperature
of PLA. However, this loss in stiffness at elevated temperatures is
reduced as SA–GMA is incorporated up to 0.7 phr. Similarly,
EBA–GMA showed an enhancement in the HDT over the 70:30 PET/PLA
blend at low loadings, though this gradually reduced as the higher
content of the compatibilizer was present in the system because of
the rubbery phase present. The same trend was prevalent in the combined
blends with both SA–GMA and EBA–GMA.

Thermal Properties
Differential
scanning calorimetry
(DSC) characterization was carried out to further illustrate the effects
of compatibilizers on PET/PLA blends. As shown in Table 3, two separate glass transition
temperatures for PET and PLA were detected for all blend formulations
and these shifted to higher temperatures by the addition of compatibilizers
for both polymers. This indicates that the generated PET–SA–GMA–PLA
and PET–EBA–GMA–PLA by epoxide reactions induced
a molecular weight increase and these highly cross-linked molecules
further enhanced the entanglement of PET and PLA chains. Compared
with those of neat PET and PLA, Tg differences
of the two polymers become closer, which shows partial miscibility
with the help of compatibilizers.28 It
is noteworthy that the Tg positions are
closer when using SA–GMA, while they get larger with EBA–GMA,
when taking T70 as a reference: the addition of 0.7 phr of SA–GMA
resulted in Tg increases from 61.6 to
63.7 °C and from 50.6 to 54.8 °C for PET and PLA, respectively,
suggesting that the Tg gap was shortened
from 11.0 to 8.9 °C while the corresponding Tg gap was enlarged to 16.9 °C with 14% EBA–GMA
(T56-E14). In addition, SA–GMA shows larger effects on Tg shifts of PLA while EBA–GMA exhibits
larger effects on those of PET: up to 4.7% (PET) and 8.9% (PLA) increase
using SA–GMA; up to 15.6% (PET) and 7.8% (PLA) under the addition
of EBA–GMA. These findings reveal that the compatibility of
PET/PLA/SA–GMA is higher than that of the EBA–GMA system
by cross-linking more decomposed PLA while EBA–GMA has a relatively
high affinity to react with PET. This result is in accordance with
other reports that SA–GMA displays partial miscibility with
PLA and an array of other polyesters while EBA–GMA and PLA
are immiscible forming separate phases with weak adhesion.19

As shown in Table 3, the addition of
different compatibilizers leads to crystallinity
changes. The crystallinities of both PET and PLA are higher in the
EBA–GMA system than those in the SA–GMA system. This
can be explained by the micelle structure of PET–EBA–GMA–PET
acting as a nucleation center to accelerate crystallization, while
the highly branched structure of PLA–SA–GMA–PET
cannot be readily incorporated into the crystal lattice.29 Interestingly, the crystallinity of PET primarily
increased with the addition of the SA–GMA content and the crystallinity
of PLA decreased, whereas the opposite tendency was presented in the
EBA–GMA system. It might be caused by the following reasons:
for the SA–GMA scenario, PET will crystallize first during
cooling and will have more crystallinity from the increased molecular
weight with the help of SA–GMA. This will segregate the PLA
component, reducing the crystallization capability of PLA, which in
turn lowers the PLA crystallinity. For the alternative case with EBA–GMA,
the rubbery component impedes the crystallinity of PET during cooling
because of viscous characteristics that prevent PET to flow easily
together reducing the PET crystallinity. At the same time, PLA having
a low viscosity at the crystallization temperature of PET will be
able to form larger PLA regions that allow for increased crystallization.

Rheological Characterization
The angular-frequency-dependent
complex viscosity modulus for PET/PLA blends are shown in Figures 9a and 10a. It was detected that the complex viscosities
of all PET/PLA blends with EBA–GMA and/or SA–GMA more
than doubled, which further demonstrated that epoxide reactions caused
a molecular weight increase. Specifically, shear-thinning behaviors
were shown at all frequencies, and shear-thinning of the blends with
EBA–GMA exhibited this effect more significantly. It can be
explained by the following hypothesis. Although the epoxy group density
of SA–GMA is greater than that of EBA–GMA, the total
amount of epoxy groups in PET/PLA/EBA–GMA is close or even
higher than that in PET/PLA/SA–GMA. Therefore, there are more
polyester arms grafted on EBA–GMA chains, indicating a comb
architecture and greater degree of shear thinning.30,31

Figures 9b,c and 10b,c show evolutions of the
storage and loss modulus
at different angular frequencies. Significant increases of G′ can be observed with increasing concentrations
of SA–GMA and/or EBA–GMA. Gel-like behavior (tan δ
< 1, Figures 9d
and 10d) was seen only in blends with EBA–GMA.
In the case of T59.5-E10.5, T56-E14, and T56-E14-J0.7, the dependence
of G′ on frequency was weak and G″
was totally independent of the frequency at a low-frequency range,
revealing nonterminal low-frequency behaviors. It can be explained
by a large agglomeration of ethylene chains as well as fixed PET and
PLA chains in the samples, resulting in effectively restrained polymer
chains. These results illustrated different strengthening mechanisms.
The long ethylene-chain-based EBA–GMA was able to form a micelle
structure with hydrophobic ethylene chain inside and fixed PET/PLA
chains by epoxide reactions outside. This structure acts as an elastomeric
reinforced center that can absorb and dissipate impact energy to avoid
craze and crack propagation.18,19,32 However, the micelles show relatively poor adhesion with the PLA
phase. On the other hand, SA–GMA with a high density of glycidyl
methacrylate units cross-linked both PET and PLA into the same molecule,
which connected both PET and PLA phases and increased their compatibility.
Combined with their mechanical properties, the lower value of elongation
at break for EBA–GMA-reinforced samples was likely caused by
the low adhesion among micelle and PET/PLA phases.

Conclusions
Up to 30 wt % biobased PLA was successfully introduced into a PET
matrix, and two different compatibilizers, EBA–GMA and SA–GMA,
were used for improving the mechanical properties of the blends. Both
compatibilizers increased the impact strength as compared to that
of neat PET. Unlike the effects of EBA–GMA that resulted in
a decrease of modulus and elongation at break, blends with 0.7 phr
of SA–GMA showed a high impact strength of 30.1 J m–1, compared with the base 70:30 wt % PET/PLA blend, without sacrificing
the tensile and flexural properties. The use of both compatibilizers
together did not show substantial improvements, which can be explained
by their different strengthening mechanisms. SA–GMA cross-linked
PET and the decomposed PLA by elevated temperature processing and
increased their compatibility, resulting in co-continuous phases in
the blend, while the micelle in the EBA–GMA system showed relatively
poor adhesion to the PLA phases.

Overall, 0.7 phr of SA–GMA,
acting simultaneously as a chain
extender and a compatibilizer, was sufficient in overcoming all of
the challenges related to PET/PLA blends including PLA degradation
at high processing temperatures, the lack of miscibility between PET
and PLA, and minimal use of a compatibilizer to retain biobased carbon
content. It also provided a satisfactory mechanical performance on
par with or superior to neat PET. These findings were observed from
AFM and SEM morphologies, along with the interfacial tension calculations,
crystallinity and glass transition observations, and viscosity from
rheological analysis. Considering the cost–performance balance,
blending PET/PLA with SA–GMA is an attractive approach to replace
a portion of the PET and to increase the biobased carbon content simultaneously.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Two injection-grade polymers were used in
this study: PET (Laser+, B90A) was produced and supplied by DAK Americas
and PLA (Ingeo 3251D) was purchased from Nature Works LLC. Additionally,
poly(ethylene-n-butylene-acrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (EBA–GMA) was supplied by DuPont company
under the trade name Elvaloy PTW. This terpolymer chain consists of
66.75 wt % ethylene, 28 wt % butyl acrylate, and 5.25 wt % glycidyl
methacrylate.33 Another compatibilizer,
poly(styrene-acrylic−co-glycidyl methacrylate)
(SA–GMA) known as Joncryl ADR-4368C (flakes), was supplied
by BASF. It has an average molecular weight of 6800 g mol–1 with an epoxy equivalent weight of 285 g mol–1, indicating 49.8 wt % glycidyl methacrylate (Mw = 142.15 g mol–1) according to the equation34 1  The
chemical structures of EBA–GMA
and SA–GMA have significant similarities, but these terpolymers
have a large variation in reactivity on the account of the 10-fold
difference in epoxy groups due to the amount of glycidyl methacrylate.

Processing
PET and PLA pellets were dried for 16 h
at 80 °C to remove the moisture. EBA–GMA and SA–GMA
were kept under room-temperature conditions (23 °C, 50% relative
humidity), with the chain extender ground into a powder before utilization.
The processing materials based on different formulations were blend-compounded
and subsequently injection-molded using a lab-scale co-rotating twin-screw
extruder and an injection molding machine (DSM Xplore, Netherlands).
The processing conditions were as follows: a mixing temperature of
270 °C (except for neat PLA processed at 190 °C), a screw
speed of 100 rpm, a residence time of 2 min, a mold temperature of
30 °C, and an injection pressure of 6 bars with a holding pressure
of 8 bars and holding time of 10 s. Tensile, flexural, and impact
specimens were prepared for further analysis. Abbreviations of the
sample names are listed in Table 4.

Characterizations
A SEM (Phenom
Pro X, PhenomWorld,
Netherlands) was used for morphological observations. The observation
areas were directly collected from the cracked cross section parts
after notched impact test and followed by Au coating for 10 s.

An Instron Universal Testing Machine (model 3382) was used to perform
tensile (ASTM standard D638) and flexural tests (ASTM standard D790).
Crosshead speeds of 14 mm min–1 for the flexural
test and 50 mm min–1 for the tensile test were used.
A Testing Machine Inc. Instrument equipped with a 5 lbs per ft Izod
impact pendulum was used for notched Izod impact strength measurements
(ASTM standard D256).

A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
analysis was performed
in a TA Instruments Q200 setup under N2 flow (flow rate:
50 mL min–1). The heating and cooling rates were
10 and 5 °C min–1, respectively. Cold crystallization
temperature (Tcc), melting temperature
(Tm), cold crystallization enthalpy (ΔHcc), and melting enthalpy (ΔHm) of specimen were determined in the first heating scan.
The glass transition temperature (Tg)
values were obtained from the second heating scan. The degree of crystallinity
(χc) of PET and PLA were calculated according to
the following equation35,36 2  where ΔHm0 is the melting
enthalpy of the completely crystalline PET or PLA and ⌀ is
the weight fraction of PET or PLA in the individual specimens. Here,
the values of ΔHm0 of PET and PLA were 140 and 93.7 J g–1, respectively.37,38

The heat deflection
temperature was determined using a dynamic
mechanical analysis equipment Q800 from TA Instruments, using a three-point
bending test with a 0.455 MPa load and a heating rate of 2 °C
min–1, according to ASTM D648.

A strain-controlled
rheometer (Anton Paar, MCR 302) was used to
study the rheological properties. Tests were conducted using parallel-plate
geometry (diameter = 25 mm) with a gap of 1 mm between the plates.
A dynamic frequency sweep test was conducted using a fixed shear strain
of 1% with a frequency range of 0.01–100 Hz (from low to high
frequency). The rheological measurements were all performed at 255
°C under N2 atmosphere.

Contact angle analysis
was performed with a ramé-hart standard
goniometer 260-U1 (ramé-hart Instrument Co.) on neat samples
of PET, PLA, and EBA–GMA, while SA–GMA, being a powder,
could not be characterized following this method. Both deionized water
(polar) and diiodomethane (nonpolar) were used as the standard liquids
for sessile drop analysis with DROPimage software (version 2.8.05)
using the circle method. The Owens–Wendt–Rabel–Kaelble
model was used for surface tension calculations followed by extrapolation
to processing temperatures, which were taken for interfacial tension
determination with the geometric mean equation, as discussed in a
previous publication.39

Atomic force
microscopy (AFM) was conducted using a Multimode 8
(Bruker Nano Inc.) with a Nanoscope V controller and Nanoscope Software
(version 8.15) for capturing images. An RTESPA525 Si cantilever was
used as the probe, and scans were carried out in a tapping PeakForce
quantitative nanomechanical property mapping mode. Samples were ultramicrotomed
prior to imaging with a Leica Ultracut (Leica) to provide a smooth
surface plane for imaging. The images were then analyzed with Nanoscope
Analysis Software.
