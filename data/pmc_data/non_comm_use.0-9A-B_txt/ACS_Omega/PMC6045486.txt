Hispolon (HS), a
bioactive polyphenol, and its derivatives such
as hispolon monomethyl ether (HME), hispolon pyrazole (HP), and hispolon
monomethyl ether pyrazole (HMEP) were evaluated for comparative toxicity
and antigenotoxic effects. The stability of HS derivatives in biological
matrices followed the order HS < HP ≈ HME < HMEP. The
cytotoxicity analysis of HS derivatives indicated that HP and HMEP
were less toxic than HS and HME, respectively, in both normal and
tumor cell types. The mechanisms of toxicity of HS and HME involved
inhibition of thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) and/or induction of reductive
stress. From the enzyme kinetic and docking studies, it was established
that HS and HME interacted with the NADPH-binding domain of TrxR through
electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds, resulting in inhibition of the
catalytic activity. Subsequently, treatment with HS, HP, and HMEP
at a nontoxic concentration of 10 μM in Chinese Hamster Ovary
(CHO) cells showed significant protection against radiation (4 Gy)-induced
DNA damage as assessed by micronuclei and γ-H2AX assays. In
conclusion, the above results suggested the importance of phenolic
and diketo groups in controlling the stability and toxicity of HS
derivatives. The pyrazole derivatives, HP and HMEP, may gain significance
in the development of functional foods.

1 Introduction
A recent
focus of therapeutic research is to develop multifunctional
compounds exhibiting pharmacological activities such as antitumor,
anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antibacterial, among others. In
this context, natural products derived from the biological sources
have emerged as the first choice of researchers.1 Accordingly, several plant-/fungal-/bacterial-derived natural
products are in different stages of evaluation as new therapeutic
agents.2−4 There has been also a growing interest among the
researchers for exploring synthetic derivatives of natural products
as a novel class of drugs with multiple activities and target specificity.5−7

Hispolon (HS) is one such bioactive polyphenol found in several
medicinal mushrooms. It was isolated initially from Inonotus Hispidus and hence named HS.8 Subsequently, HS was isolated from other species of mushrooms
such as Phellinus Linteus and Phellinus Igniarius.9,10 There are
increasing lines of evidence in the literature to suggest that HS
exhibits a wide range of medicinal properties. For example, it has
been reported for antiviral,11 hepatoprotective,12 immunomodulatory,13 and antiproliferative activities14−16 in different models.
Of these, antitumor activity of HS has been studied in detail by different
groups and it was observed that HS inhibits growth of cancer cells
through induction of cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and suppression
of metastasis.15,17−19 However, the
underlying mechanisms responsible for these effects are not understood
completely. Considering the importance of HS as a pharmacological
agent, several of its new derivatives have been synthesized and evaluated
for antiproliferative and antitubercular effects.20,21 On similar lines, recently our group reported the abilities of HS
and its derivatives such as hispolon pyrazole (HP), hispolon monomethyl
ether (HME), and hispolon monomethyl ether pyrazole (HMEP) to scavenge
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to exhibit antioxidant activity
in cell-free systems.22 The exposure of
carcinogenic agents such as radiation, pollutants, and xenobiotics
are known to increase the intracellular levels of ROS, leading to
oxidative damages.23,24 Although DNA is a stable, well-protected
molecule, it is the most critical subcellular target of ROS-induced
oxidative damages and is believed to be responsible for the onset
of cell death, mutagenesis, and carcinogenesis.25 Therefore, any agent which can attenuate ROS (antioxidant
activity) and the subsequent DNA damage (antigenotoxic activity) can
help in reducing the initiation and progression of cancer.26 This prompted us to hypothesize that HS and
its derivatives may be explored for both chemotherapy and/or chemoprevention.
However, the main hurdle in developing natural products as therapeutic
agents is that they switch over from antioxidant to cytotoxic behavior
depending on the dosage and type of the target cell.27,28 It is therefore necessary to identify the conditions under which
such compounds show differential activities to take full advantage
of their therapeutic potential. With this background, in the present
study, HS and its three derivatives HME, HP, and HMEP were evaluated
for the following: (i) chemical stability in biological matrices such
as phosphate buffer and cell culture medium containing fetal bovine
serum (FBS); (ii) cytotoxic effect in normal and tumor cells; (iii)
mechanisms of antiproliferative effect in human breast cancer cell
line (MCF7); and (iv) antigenotoxic effect against radiation exposure
in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. The purpose of this study
is to provide scientific rationale for developing HS and its derivatives
as chemopreventive and/or chemotherapeutic agents. The chemical structures of HS and its
derivatives evaluated in the present study are shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures
of HS and Its Derivatives
2 Results
2.1 Assessment of Chemical
Stability of HS and
Its Derivatives
The chemical stabilities of HS, HP, HME,
and HMEP were investigated by monitoring their degradation kinetics
in physiological matrices such as phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and cell
culture medium containing 10% FBS. To address this, HS and its derivatives
were first characterized for absorption spectrum. For this, stock
solutions of HS and its derivatives were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) and then added to phosphate buffer to achieve a final concentration
of 10 μM of each compound and the DMSO concentration of 1%.
The absorption spectra of all solutions were recorded in the wavelength
range of 250–550 nm. The spectra shown in Figure 1A indicated that compounds
HS, HP, HME, and HMEP exhibit absorption maximum at 360, 316, 360,
and 316 nm, respectively. There was an additional shoulder observed
at 296 nm in the case of HP and HMEP. On the basis of this information,
the degradation kinetics of each of the above compounds was followed
by monitoring absorbance at their respective absorption maximum for
a period of 4.5 h with an interval of 30 min. The percent stability
as a function of time calculated from the absorbance values normalized
with respect to the absorbance at 0 min is shown in Figure 1B,C for phosphate buffer and
cell culture medium, respectively. The degradation kinetics of HS,
HP, HME, and HMEP initially decayed as a function of time and then
reached saturation in both the matrices. Notably, all the four compounds
were relatively more stable in cell culture medium (10% FBS) compared
to phosphate buffer (Figure 1B,C). For example HS, HP, HME, and HMEP degraded by 65, 30,
30, and 15%, respectively, within 1 h of their addition to phosphate
buffer. In contrast, degradation of HS, HP, HME, and HMEP in culture
medium (10% FBS) was slower with about only 30, 15, 30, and 20% degraded,
respectively, in 2.5 h (Figure 1B,C). The methoxy derivative, HME, was more stable compared
to HS, and the pyrazole derivatives, HP and HMEP, were more stable
compared to the respective parent compounds HS and HME in both the
matrices studied (Figure 1B,C). From the results, it is inferred that pyrazole substitution
at the diketo position and methoxy substitution in the phenolic group
enhance the stability of HS under physiological conditions.

blanks without HS derivatives were used. (B,C) Degradation of HS derivatives

at 37 °C for a period of 4.5 h. The final concentration of DMSO
in the reaction mixture was 1%. The absorbance was monitored at 360
nm for HS and HME and at 316 nm for HP and HMEP using a UV–visible
spectrophotometer with an interval of 30 min. The data are normalized
to a value of 100% at zero time. Each value represents the mean of
triplicate samples.

2.2 Cytotoxicity
Evaluation of HS and Its Derivatives
The toxicity of HS,
HP, HME, and HMEP was evaluated in CHO, splenic
lymphocytes, MCF7, and A549 cells. For this, cells were treated with
increasing concentrations (5–100 μM) of HS, HP, HME,
and HMEP for 48 h, and viability was determined using the MTT assay.
The results as shown in Figure 2A–D indicated that HS induced a concentration-dependent
toxicity in all the four cell types with relatively higher toxicity
in tumor cells such as MCF7 and A549 at each of the concentrations
tested (Figure 2).
The IC50 (half maximal concentration to inhibit proliferation
by 50%) of HS was estimated to be 42, 68, >100, and >100 μM,
respectively, for MCF7, A549, CHO, and lymphocytes. The methoxy derivative,
HME, was found to be significantly higher toxic than HS in all the
four cell types with an IC50 of 35, 25, 89, and 20 μM,
respectively, for MCF7, A549, CHO, and lymphocytes (Figure 2). Notably, pyrazole derivatives,
HP and HMEP, showed significantly lesser toxicity compared to HS and
HME, respectively, in all four cell types (Figure 2). The IC50 of HP in all the four
cell types was >100 μM, whereas HMEP exhibited an IC50 of 42 μM in MCF7 cells, 75 μM in lymphocytes
and >100
μM in other two cell types. These results clearly suggested
that pyrazole substitution at the diketo position reduced the toxicities
of HS and HME. Furthermore, to understand the mode of cell death,
MCF7 and A549 cells were treated with HS derivatives at 50 μM
(close to IC50 in these cell types) for 48 h and stained
with propidium iodide (PI) for cell cycle analysis through FACS. The
distribution of cells into different phases of cell cycle is presented
in Figures 3 and S1. It can be seen that treatment with HS and
HME led to increase in the pre-G1 peak indicative of apoptosis in
both MCF7 and A549 cells. Furthermore, pyrazole derivatives HP and
HMEP were found to be significantly less effective than HS and HME,
respectively, in inducing apoptosis (pre-G1) in above cell types,
supporting MTT results (Figures 3 and S1 of the Supporting Information). Notably, HMEP treatment in A549 cells showed increase in the number
of cells in the G2/M phase suggestive of cell cycle arrest (Figure
S1 of the Supporting Information).

2.3 Effects
of HS and Its Derivatives on the Intracellular
Redox State in MCF7 Cells
The effect of HS, HP, HME, and
HMEP on the cellular redox state was investigated in MCF7 cells at
a treatment concentration of 25 μM for 48 h. The ratio of glutathione
(GSH) and oxidized glutathione (GSSG) is considered to be the indicator
of the intracellular redox state. The effect of HS derivatives on
the ratio of GSH and GSSG is presented in Figure 4A. The results indicated that treatment with
HS did not cause any significant change in the basal GSH/GSSG in MCF7
cells. However, similar treatments with HP, HME, and HMEP led to ∼7
folds increase in GSH/GSSG. The effect of HS derivatives on the activity
levels of enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione
S-transferase (GST), and GR (known to be involved in regulation of
GSH and GSSH) are presented in Figure 4B–D, respectively. It can be seen that compounds
HS and HME did not cause any significant change in the basal activity
of GPx and GST; however, their corresponding pyrazole derivatives
HP and HMEP showed inhibition of GPx activity by 31 and 40%, respectively,
and of GST by 31 and 65%, respectively. Furthermore, HS and HMEP did
not affect the basal GR activity, whereas other two derivatives HP
and HME significantly increased the GR level by 52 and 85%, respectively.
To address the effect of HS derivatives on the de Novo synthesis of
GSH, the mRNA expression of γ-glutamyl-cysteine ligase (γ-GCL)
(enzyme catalyzing GSH biosynthesis) was monitored by real-time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results shown in Figure 5A indicated that HS led to a marginal increase
in mRNA expression of γ-GCL, whereas the other three derivatives
did not affect its expression compared to control cells. Taken together,
above results suggested that HP, HME, and HMEP induced reductive environment
within cells through affecting the utilization-recycling pathway of
GSH.29

2.4 Effect of HS and Its Derivatives on Thioredoxin
Reductase (TrxR) Activity in MCF7 Cells
Reduced form of thioredoxin
(Trx) is known to play an important role in maintaining the cellular
redox homeostasis.30 Therefore, HS and
its derivatives were investigated for their effects on the activity
level of TrxR in MCF7 cells, following treatment at 25 μM for
48 h. The activity level of TrxR under different treatment conditions
is presented in Figure 5B. It can be seen that all the four compounds HS, HP, HME, and HMEP
led to significant inhibition of TrxR; however, pyrazole derivatives
HP and HMEP were less inhibitory compared to parent compounds HS and
HME, respectively (Figure 5B). The percent inhibition in TrxR activity by HS, HP, HME,
and HMEP was observed to be 58, 27, 55, and 37%, respectively (Figure 5B).

2.5 Direct Inhibition of TrxR by HS and Its Derivatives
in Cell-Free Systems
Furthermore, to understand whether TrxR
is one of the direct targets of HS and its derivatives, HP, HME, and
HMEP, were evaluated for TrxR inhibition in a cell-free system. In
brief, purified TrxR was incubated with varying concentrations (5–100
μM) of HS, HP, HME, and HMEP and then followed for enzyme kinetics
using DTNB as the substrate and NADPH as the redox equivalent. The
rate of formation of TNB by TrxR in the presence and absence of HS,
HP, HME, and HMEP is presented in Figure 6. The percent TrxR activity calculated from
above kinetics at two different concentrations (10 and 100 μM)
of test compounds is shown in Figure S2 (of the Supporting Information). From these results, it is clear that
compounds HS and HME did not cause much (∼15–25%) inhibition
of TrxR up to a concentration of 50 μM. However, as the concentration
was increased to 100 μM, both the compounds led to almost complete
(∼85–95%) inhibition of TrxR. In comparison to HS and
HME, the pyrazole derivatives, HP and HMEP, respectively, showed lesser
inhibition of TrxR activity. Furthermore, to know whether inhibitions
by HS derivatives are reversible in nature, a competition experiment
was performed by varying NADPH concentration from 10–100 μM,
keeping the concentration of HS derivatives (HS and HME, potent ones)
fixed at 50 μM and monitoring the rate of formation of TNB.
The data were analyzed according to the Lineweaver–Burk plot
as shown in Figure S3 (of the Supporting Information). The Km (Michaelis–Menten constant)
and Vmax (maximum reaction velocity) values
calculated from the slope and intercept of above plots revealed that Km of NADPH increased from 8.9 μM in control
reaction to 10.4 and 20 μM in the presence of HS and HME, respectively.
On the other hand, the Vmax value of 1
nmole/min remained unaffected between the control reaction and those
treated with HS and HME. Taken together, these results indicated of
reversible inhibition of TrxR by HS ad HME. On the basis of these
results, molecular docking studies were performed to identify possible
binding sites of HS, HP, HME, and HMEP in the cytosolic TrxR. This
protein has three important domains, namely interface domain harboring
the active site, FAD-binding domain, and NADPH-binding domain, responsible
for catalytic activity. All these three domains were considered for
the computation of binding energy with all possible conformers (structure
shown in Figure S4 of the Supporting Information) taking into account of both hydrophobic and electrostatic mode
of interactions. From the calculated binding energy (ΔG value), it was observed that HS and its derivatives interacted
with both the interface domain and the NADPH-binding domain of TrxR.
However, the trend observed from the experimental results (on inhibition
of TrxR by HS derivatives in cellular and cell-free experiments) correlated
with the ΔG values of interactions with the
NADPH domain. The ΔG values of the interaction
of different conformers of HS, HME, HP, and HMEP with the NADPH domain
of TrxR are presented in Table S1 (of the Supporting Information). Among the different conformers, the keto form
of HS and HME and the inner desmotropic form of HP and HMEP due to
extended conjugation are expected to be the predominant forms in the
hydrophobic protein environment. Considering ΔG values of these stable conformers, their binding to the NADPH domain
of TrxR followed the order HME > HS ≈ HMEP > HP. As per
the
favored pose of the ligand on the protein shown in Figure 7, HS and HP experience a similar
amino acid environment during their binding to TrxR wherein amino
acid residues, such as Ser 222, lle 223, and Arg 226, are involved
in electrostatic interaction with the phenolic hydroxyl group, whereas
Gly 292, Ser 199, Ala 198, and Val 291 are involved in hydrophobic
interaction with aromatic and the α,β-unsaturated moieties.
Notably, methylated derivatives of HS and HP differed in their amino
acid environment involved in the binding. For example, amino acid
residues Ala 290, Ala 198, Val 291, Gly 292, and Ser 199 in case of
HMEP and Arg 221, Gly 197, and Ala 198 in case of HME were responsible
for hydrophobic interaction. On the other hand, the phenolic hydroxyl
group in HME and HMEP was bound to IIe 223 and Ser 222 via electrostatic
interaction. Additionally, electrostatic interactions were contributed
by Ala 290 and Arg 221 for HMEP and by Arg 166 and Arg 221 for HME.
Taken together, these results suggested that the inhibitory effect
of HS and HME on TrxR is due to their interaction with its NADPH-binding
domain.

presence of the increasing concentrations of HS derivatives (5–100
μM) in the cell-free system. The A412 was followed for 5 min
against identical blank without TrxR.

dotted line represents the electrostatic interaction.

2.6 Effect of HS and Its Derivatives
on the Radiation-Induced
Micronuclei Formation in CHO Cells
Because HS, HP, and HMEP
showed negligible toxicity (<10%) in cells up to a concentration
of 10 μM, these compounds were considered suitable for evaluating
the antigenotoxic effect against radiation exposure. For this, CHO
cells, being an ideal model cellular system for genotoxicity evaluation,31,32 were pretreated with test compounds (2.5–10 μM) for
2 h and irradiated at 4 Gy. The micronuclei frequency was determined
at 18 h postirradiation, and the results are presented in Figure 8A–C. It was
observed that exposure to radiation led to a significant increase
in micronuclei frequency. Pretreatment with HS did not affect the
radiation-induced micronuclei formation up to a concentration of 5
μM; however, at higher concentrations of 7.5 and 10 μM,
it showed reduction in micronuclei formation by 20 and 22%, respectively
(Figure 8A). In contrast,
pyrazole derivatives HP and HMEP showed reduction in radiation-induced
micronuclei formation by ∼25% at concentration as low as 2.5
μM (Figure 8B,C).
Increasing the concentration up to 10 μM did not show much change
in the protective effect of HP and HMEP (Figure 8B,C). The compound control groups did not
show any induction of micronucleus, suggesting them to be safe at
tested concentrations. Because all the three compounds showed the
saturation effect with respect to protection from micronuclei formation
at a concentration of 10 μM, all our subsequent studies were
carried out only at this concentration. Nuclear division index (NDI)
is a marker of cell proliferation. To determine this parameter, CHO
cells pretreated with HS, HP, and HMEP (10 μM for 2 h) were
exposed to γ-radiation at 4 Gy. As shown in Figure 8D, irradiation decreased the
NDI and pretreatment with HS did not affect this much. In contrast,
HP and HMEP showed increase in NDI as compared to radiation control
(Figure 8D). The compound
control groups showed NDI comparable to sham control (Figure 8D). The representative images
showing mononucleated, binucleated, and trinucleated cells are presented
Figure S5 (of the Supporting Information).

Figure 8 (A–C) Bar graphs show the effect of pretreatment with HS
and its derivatives (2.5–10 μM for 2 h) against radiation

treatment condition. (D) Effect of the pretreatment with HS and its
derivatives (10 μM for 2 h) on the NDI of irradiated (4 Gy)

group. CN—control, IR—Radiation.

2.7 Effect of HS and Its Derivatives on the Radiation-Induced
Early DNA Damage in CHO Cells by γ-H2AX Assay
The effect
of HS derivatives on radiation-induced acute DNA damage was studied
at 30 min postirradiation. For this, CHO cells, pretreated (10 μM
for 2 h) with HS, HP, and HMEP, and irradiated at 2 Gy, were examined
for γ-H2AX foci per cell. The result of this assay is presented
in Figure 9. It can
be seen that irradiation led to a significant increase in the number
of γ-H2AX foci by almost 10 folds. Pretreatment with all the
three compounds showed decrease in the number of γ-H2AX foci
compared to radiation control, suggesting protection from radiation
induced acute DNA damage (Figure 9). The compounds HS and HP were marginally better than
HMEP in this assay. The compound control groups did not show any induction
of γ-H2AX foci (Figure 9).

Figure 9 (A) Bar graphs show the average number of gamma γH2AX foci
per nucleus under different treatment conditions in CHO cells. The
cells were treated with HS and its derivatives at a concentration
of 10 μM and were exposed to 2 Gy of γ-radiation. (B)

condition. CN—control, IR—radiation.

2.8 Effect of HS and Its Derivatives
on the Radiation-Induced
DNA Repair
The effect of HS derivatives on DNA repair kinetics
was studied by comet assay. For this, CHO cells, pretreated (10 μM
for 2 h) with HS, HP, and HMEP, were irradiated at 4 Gy and evaluated
for DNA damage parameters like tail length (TL) and olive tail moment
(OTM) as a function of time starting from 0 to 60 min. The results
of these parameters and the representative images of SYBR Green-II
stained nuclei from different groups are presented in Figure 10. The exposure to radiation
led to a significant increase in DNA damage parameters, which reduced
with the progress of time suggesting the normal repair process (Figure 10). Pretreatment
with HS, HP, and HMP showed a significant decrease in DNA damage parameters
compared to the radiation control group at each of the time point
studied. Notably HS and its derivatives reduced DNA damage parameters
at 0 min itself compared to radiation control (Figure 10). This suggested that HS and its derivatives
prevented the radiation-induced initial DNA damage instead of augmenting
the DNA repair efficiency. The compounds HS and HP were more effective
than HMEP in reducing the radiation-induced initial DNA damage (Figure 10).

min postirradiation. Results are presented as mean ± SEM, n = 3. CN—control, IR—radiation. *p < 0.05 as compared to respective control groups. #p < 0.05 compared to radiation control
groups.

2.9 Effect
of HS and Its Derivatives on the Radiation
Induced ROS Generation in CHO Cells
The effect of pretreatment
(10 μM for 2 h) with HS, HP, and HMEP on the intracellular ROS
level was monitored at 30 min postirradiation. The results shown in Figure 11 indicated that
exposure to radiation (2 Gy) led to a significant increase in the
ROS generation compared to the sham control. Pretreatment with HS,
HP, and HMEP resulted in significant reduction in the ROS level by
40, 43, and 30%, respectively, as compared to radiation control (Figure 11). The compound
control groups did not show any significant change in basal ROS level
(Figure 11).

treatments are representative of the ROS levels. *p < 0.05 when compared to control; #p < 0.05 when compared to radiation control.

3 Discussion
HS, a natural product obtained
from mushroom, has attracted a lot
of interest among researchers for its multiple pharmacological activities
such as antioxidant, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and antibacterial,
among others.8,11−16 This has led researchers to synthesize new derivatives of HS and
to explore them for various pharmacological activities.20−22 In the present study, four compounds namely HS, HME, HP, and HMEP
have been evaluated for chemical stability, toxicities, and antigenotoxic
effects to identify a potential lead phytochemical for cancer chemotherapy
and chemoprevention.

The stability of HS and its derivatives
was studied under physiological
conditions (37 °C, pH = 7.4) in two different biological matrices
such as phosphate buffer and complete culture medium.33 Results clearly indicated that HS is least stable irrespective
of the biological medium. In contrast, HME having the hydroxyl group
replaced with the methoxy group in the ring structure showed higher
stability. Previously, in the case of curcumin, a structural analog
of HS, it has been shown that the phenolic hydroxyl group can undergo
auto-oxidation, and accordingly, the increased stability of HME over
HS can be attributed to the presence of the methoxy group in the ring
structure.34 Furthermore, the conjugated
diene structure of curcumin also contributes to instability through
hydrolysis under neutral–basic conditions.35 With a similar analogy, blocking the diketo group with
the pyrazole group further increased the stability of HS and HME in
biological matrices. In general, the presence of serum (10%) increased
the chemical stability of HS and its three derivatives, which is in
line with stability reports of curcumin.33 Having understood this, HS and its derivatives were screened for
toxicity in normal cells such as CHO and lymphocytes and in tumor
cells such as A549 and MCF7. The results indicated that HS induced
selective toxicity in tumor cells, whereas its methoxy derivative
(HME) was toxic in both normal and tumor cell types. Interestingly,
the compounds, HP and HMEP, wherein the diketo moiety is replaced
with the pyrazole group showed lesser toxicity compared to respective
parent compounds, HS and HME, in all the four cell types investigated.
The cell cycle analysis in the tumor cells such as MCF7 and A549 revealed
that HS and HME caused the pre-G1 peak indicative of apoptosis, whereas
HMEP treatment showed cell cycle arrest (G2/M). Furthermore, to understand
the mechanisms responsible for the differential toxicity of HS derivatives,
their effects on cellular redox state were studied in the most sensitive
cell type, MCF7. Redox state is considered to be the most critical
parameter controlling the fate of cells.29,36 The results indicated that HS did not affect the ratio of GSH and
GSSG, whereas the other three derivatives HME, HP, and HMEP significantly
increased this ratio, suggestive of reducing environment within cells.
Intracellular level of GSH is mainly regulated by its de Novo synthesis,
recycling, and utilization.29 For example;
endogenous synthesis of GSH is catalyzed by γ-GCL. Similarly,
enzymes such as GPx and GST are involved in the utilization of GSH,
whereas GR recycles GSSG into GSH. The results on the measurement
of these enzymes indicated that treatments with HME, HP, and HMEP
caused a significant increase in the level of GR with concurrent decrease
in the levels of GPx and GST. Notably HME, HP, and HMEP did not show
any significant change in the mRNA expression of γ-GCL. Taken
together, above results indicated that HP, HME, and HMEP induced reductive
environment within cells by affecting the utilization-recycling pathway
of GSH and not by inducing GSH biosynthesis.

There are growing
lines of evidence in the literature that alterations
in the ratio of GSH and GSSG toward a more reduced status lead to
cell cycle arrest and in turn cell death.37,38 However, toxicity results of HS derivatives were not in agreement
with the above assumption, suggesting the involvement of factors in
addition to just the redox state. Recently, Trotter and Grant reported
that the reduced form of Trx plays an important role in rescuing the
cells from reductive stress.30 Additionally,
Trx is required for DNA synthesis and subsequent progression of cell
cycle.39 The reduced form of Trx is maintained
by TrxR, and so, the inhibition or decrease in the activity of this
enzyme is known to cause antiproliferative effects and/or cytotoxicity.40,41 This prompted us to presume that HS derivatives might be targeting
TrxR to express their toxicity in cells. To address this, the effect
of HS, HP, HME, and HMEP on the activity of TrxR was investigated.
Notably, results from these studies indicated that both HS and HME
led to significantly higher inhibition of TrxR activity compared to
their pyrazole derivatives. From the docking studies, it was established
that HS and HME interacted with the NADPH-binding domain of TrxR by
involving electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds and thus justifying
their inhibitory effect on enzyme activity. The competition kinetics
indicated that the inhibitory effect of HS and HME on TrxR was reversible.
However, future studies are needed to validate these results through
mass spectroscopy to completely rule out the possibility of covalent
modification of TrxR through HS and HME at higher concentrations of
treatments. Additionally in the present study, docking analysis has
been restricted to probe the interactions of HS derivatives only in
the catalytic domains of TrxR, and therefore, it is of our interest
in future to explore additional interactions beyond catalytic domains
using other docking programme such as DogSite scorer. It is also worth
mentioning that curcumin and other plant-derived phenolic compounds
have been reported to inhibit TrxR, however through interactions with
the interface domain.42 Taken together,
these observations explained that even though HP and HMEP induced
reductive environment in the cells, they exhibited lesser toxicity
because of maintenance of TrxR. Similarly, the selective toxicity
of HS could be attributed to the inhibition of TrxR, which is known
to be overexpressed in tumor cells.43 On
contrary, the inhibition of TrxR coupled with reductive stress accounted
for the significantly higher toxicity of HME over other HS derivatives
in all the cell types investigated. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study reporting the involvement of reductive stress
and inhibition of TrxR as mechanisms responsible for the antiproliferative
effects of HS and its derivative such as HME in tumor cells.

Recently, HS, HME, HP, and HMEP were reported for their abilities
to scavenge ROS and to exhibit antioxidant activity in cell-free systems.22 Additionally, observations of the present study
that HP and HMEP maintain reductive environment within cells prompted
us to hypothesize that such compounds can also be explored to protect
cells from ROS-induced DNA damage, which is a prerequisite for developing
any chemopreventive agent.26,28 To address this issue,
we employed CHO cells of epithelial origin. These cells have been
widely used in genotoxicity-related research work.44 Irradiation is known to induce DNA damage in cells through
radiolytically generated ROS.45 If the
presence of HS compounds can prevent this process, they are expected
to reduce the predisposition of genetic instability and in turn the
oncogenic transformation of the cells by genotoxic agents. Of the
three HS derivatives, HME was not considered for this study as this
compound was toxic to normal cells even at low concentrations (<10
μM). HS and the other two derivatives, HP and HMEP, showed almost similar efficacy
in preventing the radiation-induced DNA damage as monitored by γ-H2AX
and micronuclei assays. Furthermore, it was observed that pretreatment
with HS, HP, and HMEP did not influence the repair kinetics but prevented
the radiation-induced initial DNA damage. In line with these results,
pretreatment with HS, HP, and HMEP showed decrease in the ROS level
following radiation exposure. Thus, the antigenotoxic effect of HS
derivatives is attributed to the scavenging of radiation-induced ROS
generation.

In conclusion, HS exhibited both cytotoxic and antigenotoxic
effects
depending on concentration and cell type. The chemical instability
of HS under physiological conditions may be a cause of concern in
its pharmacological application. Substitution of the hydroxyl group
with the methoxy group in the ring structure of HME improved its stability,
however increased the toxicity irrespective of cell type, making it
unsuitable for pharmacological application. The mechanisms of toxicity
of HS and HME involved inhibition of TrxR and concurrent induction
of reductive stress. The pyrazole derivatives HP and HMEP showed not
only improved stability but also potent antigenotoxic effect against
radiation exposure. Thus, HP and HMEP as derivatives of a natural
product (HS) may gain significance as dietary supplements for chemoprevention.

4.2 Cell Culture and Compound Treatment
Human lung carcinoma
(A549), MCF7, and CHO cells were maintained
in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and
100 μg/mL streptomycin. Splenic lymphocytes were freshly isolated
from BALB/c mice under aseptic conditions according to the method
described earlier46 and maintained in RPMI-1640
medium supplemented with FBS and antibiotics as described above. All
the cell types were grown in a humidified incubator (MCO-230AICUVH,
Panasonic) with 5% CO2 and atmospheric O2 (20%)
at 37 °C. The stock solution of HS and its derivatives was prepared
in DMSO and diluted with complete culture medium or phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) to achieve desired concentrations. The concentration
of DMSO in cellular studies was kept constant within permissible limits
of toxicity (0.1%).

4.3 MTT Assay
Cells
(∼2 ×
103) suspended in 200 μL of complete culture medium
were seeded in each well of 96-well plates. The cells were allowed
to attach and grow for 12 h, treated with desired concentrations of
HS and its derivatives for 48 h, and then processed for MTT as described
previously.47 The percentage (%) cytotoxicity
was calculated from the decrease in absorbance at 570 nm of treated
groups as compared to that of the control group.

4.4 Biochemical Assays
Intracellular
levels of reduced GSH, GSSG, GPx, GST, and TrxR were determined at
48 h after treatment with HS and its derivatives. In brief, cell lysate
was prepared using CelLytic M containing protease inhibitor cocktail
and around ∼100 μg of protein was used for the estimation
of TrxR activity using a commercially available kit as per the manufacturer’s
instructions and of other enzymes, according to methods reported previously.46,48 Protein content in the cell lysate was determined using Bradford
assay as per manufacturer’s instruction.

4.5 TrxR Inhibition Assay
The ability
of HS or its derivatives to act as the inhibitor of mammalian TrxR
was evaluated by setting up a reaction volume of 200 μL containing
assay buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4), 100 μM
NADPH, rat liver TrxR (50 nM), and the increasing concentrations of
HS or its derivatives.49 The reaction mixture
was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and following this, DTNB (6
mM) was added to initiate the reaction. The activities were determined
by monitoring the formation of TNB at 412 nm using the plate reader.
The blank comprised reaction mixture without TrxR. The compound blank
(HS derivatives in assay buffer) was also processed in a similar manner
to get the differential absorption of TNB at 412 nm. The positive
control comprised reaction mixture without HS or its derivatives.
The activity is expressed as the percentage (%) of the control. The
final concentration of DMSO was 4% (v/v), and the control had the
same amount of DMSO.

4.6 Cell Cycle Analysis by
PI Staining
PI staining was done at 48 h after treatment
with HS and its derivatives.
In brief, cells (1 × 106) were stained with a solution
containing 50 μg mL–1 PI, 0.1% sodium citrate,
and 0.1% Triton X-100 and kept overnight at 4 °C in the dark.
The labeled cells were acquired using a flow cytometer (Partec, Germany)
and characterized for cell cycle phases using FlowJo software. The
pre-G1 phase population represented the apoptotic cells.46

4.7 Molecular Docking Studies
The structures
of HS, HP, HME, and HMEP were docked on the crystal structure of cytosolic
TrxR (PDB file number 1H6V) using LeadIT 2.1.3-FlexX (BioSolveIT, GmbH, Germany)
docking software. As HS and HME are involved in keto–enol tautomerism,
both the forms were independently used for docking studies. In the
case of HP and HMPE, desmotropic forms were used for docking studies.
All the isomeric and tautomeric forms were drawn in Gaussview programme,
and the structures were cleaned for correct bond angle and bond length
before subjecting to docking analysis. Of the six chains present in
the structure of TrxR (1H6V), the dimer formed by chains E and F was considered
for docking studies primarily because of the higher number of solved
residues and the presence of catalytically active domains. To identify
the binding site, amino acid residues such a 1–163 and 297–367
from FAD-binding domain, 164–296 from NADPH-binding domain,
and 368–499 from interface domain (where the disulfides are
reduced) were docked with the ligands. The interaction between ligand
and amino acid residues was analyzed by combining both enthalpy- and
entropy-based approaches as mentioned in a previous report.50 The favored pose of the ligand on the protein
was evaluated by the scoring method followed by calculation of binding
free energy using the in-built HYDE program of the docking software.

4.8 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR
The expression of γ-GCL was monitored by performing RT-PCR.
In brief, total RNA was isolated from cells at 48 h after treatment
with HS or its derivatives using the TRI reagent. Approximately, 2
μg of the total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription
(cDNA synthesis kit, Thermo Scientific, USA), and real-time PCR was
carried out using the template (cDNA), SYBR green master mix (Roche
Applied Science, Germany), and gene-specific primers in a Rotor-Gene
Q (QIAGEN, Germany), according to the protocol standardized earlier.51 The threshold cycle (CT) values estimated from
the above runs for the target genes were normalized against a housekeeping
gene, b-actin, according to the method described earlier.52 The primers (forward and reverse) used for cDNA
amplification are γGCL (forward): 5′-GGGGTGACGAGGTGGAGTA-3′,
γGCL (reverse): 5′-GTTGGGGTTTGTCCTCTCCC-3′, βActin
(forward): 5′-GGCTGTATTCCCCTCCATCG-3′, and βActin
(reverse): 5′-CCAGTTGGTAACAATGCCATGT-3′.

4.9 Antigenotoxic Studies
For antigenotoxic
studies, CHO cells were incubated with HS or its derivatives for 2
h, washed with PBS (pH 7.4), supplemented with serum-free medium,
and irradiated using 60Co Blood Irradiator 2000 (BRIT,
India) at a dose rate of 1 Gy/min. Following this, 10% FBS was added
to the culture medium, and cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere
with 5% CO2 at 37 °C and processed for micronuclei
and γ-H2AX and comet assays at desired time points.

4.10 Micronuclei Assay
Micronuclei assay
was performed to determine the extent of residual DNA damage following
irradiation. For this, cells were incubated with cytochalasin B (4
μg/mL) for 18 h to block cytokinesis and processed for micronuclei
detection using acridine orange as reported previously.53 A total of 500 binucleated cells were analyzed
for the presence of micronuclei per treatment condition. The NDI was
calculated using the following formula: 1  where M1, M2, M3, and M4 are the number of
cells with 1, 2, 3, and 4 nuclei, respectively, and N is the total number of viable cells. For NDI estimation, at least
500 viable cells were analyzed.

4.11 γ-H2AX
Assay
The γ-H2AX
assay was performed to assess the extent of acute DNA damage at 30
min postirradiation by the immunofluorescence method described in
our previous report.53 The numbers of γH2AX
foci in the nucleus of at least 50 cells under each treatment condition
was counted using automated slide scanning and foci scoring Metacyte
software module of the Metafer 4 scanning system (MetaSystems, Altlussheim,
Germany).

4.12 Single-Cell Alkaline Gel
Electrophoresis
Single-cell alkaline gel electrophoresis
or comet assay was performed
as a function of time (0, 30, and 60 min) to assess the DNA repair
kinetics postirradiation. In brief, ∼15 000 cells (mixed
with 0.8% low melting point agarose) layered on a slide were lysed,
subjected to electrophoresis under alkaline conditions, and stained
with SYBR Green-II. The methods of slide preparation, lysis, and the
electrophoresis are mentioned in previous reports.54 The slides were imaged using a Carl Zeiss Axioplan fluorescent
microscope (Germany), and about, 50 cells per slide were grabbed.
The images were analyzed using CASP software version 1.2.0 (www.Casplab.com) to calculate
DNA damage parameters such as TL and OTM.

4.13 Measurement
of ROS
The intracellular
levels of ROS were monitored at 30 min postirradiation. For this,
cells (1 × 104) were labeled with a cell permeable
and oxidation sensitive fluorescence probe, DCFDA (5 μM), for
30 min at 37 °C.55 The ROS level is
represented as the fluorescence intensity of DCF detected by monitoring
the emission at 530 nm after excitation at 488 nm on a multimode plate
reader (Synergy H1, Biotek, Germany).

4.14 Statistical
Analysis
All the experiments
were carried out in triplicate and repeated at least two times. The
results are presented as mean ± (SEM), n = 3
from an independent experiment. The data were analyzed by one-way
ANOVA using Origin (version 6.1) software to confirm the variability
of the data. The p values < 0.05 were considered
as statistically significant.
