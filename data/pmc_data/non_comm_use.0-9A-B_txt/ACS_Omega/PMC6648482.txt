The
chiral molecular structures of four different substituted indans, namely,
(S)-1-methylindan, (R)-1-methylindan-1-d,
(R)-1-aminoindan, and (S)-1-indanol,
were investigated using experimental vibrational absorption and vibrational
circular dichroism spectra and corresponding spectra predicted using
quantum chemical (QC) calculations. All of these molecules possess
two ring puckering conformations, with ring puckering leading to the
pseudoequatorial substituent being approximately four times more abundant
over that leading to the pseudoaxial substituent. The amino group
in 1-aminoindan has three conformations arising from the rotation
of NH2 group, for each ring puckering conformation, resulting
in a total of six conformations. Whereas 1-indanol in the nonhydrogen-bonding
solvent CCl4 also has six conformations similar to those
of 1-aminoindan, 1-indanol in the hydrogen-bonding solvent DMSO-d6 adopts numerous conformations, of which 30
conformers are considered to have at least ∼1% or more population.
In DMSO solution, ring puckering leading to pseudoequatorial substituent
accounts for 77% population and 23% for pseudoaxial substituent. The
QC spectra predicted for the geometry optimized conformers are found
to be in excellent quantitative agreement with corresponding experimental
spectra in all of the molecules considered. The procedures suggested
in this work are hoped to provide successful pathways for future chiral
molecular structural analyses.

Introduction
Determining the molecular
structures of chiral molecules is often
a challenging task. X-ray crystallography offers the most direct approach
to establish molecular structures, but its utility is restricted due
to the difficulty in obtaining good quality single crystals for the
samples of interest. The second popular approach is the use of NMR,
where chiral shift reagents are needed for studying chiral molecules.
Furthermore, the NMR time scale limits the achievable information
to average molecular structures. Optical spectroscopy suitable for
studying chiral molecules is referred to as chiroptical spectroscopy1,2 and represents an important alternative to X-ray and NMR methods.
Four different methods, optical rotatory dispersion (ORD),1−3 electronic circular dichroism (ECD),1,2,4 vibrational circular dichroism (VCD),1,2,5,6 and
vibrational Raman optical activity (VROA),1,2,6,7 fall under
the umbrella of chiroptical spectroscopy. Since optical transitions
occur on a much faster time scale, chiroptical spectroscopy is more
appropriate for investigating the molecular conformers and is increasingly
becoming popular for probing the structures of chiral molecules. As
molecular vibrational transitions are expected to be sensitive to
minor structural changes, the vibrational transition-based VCD and
VROA methods offer greater promise for chiral molecular structure
determination. The electronic transition-based ECD and ORD methods
are also sensitive for certain structural changes.

Substituted
indans have attracted interest for their chiroptical
properties since early 1970s, mainly in terms of ECD associated with
n−σ*, σ–π*, π–-σ*,
and π–π* transitions.8,9 More recently,
various jet-cooled spectroscopies were undertaken for substituted
indans, where low-frequency ring puckering modes were investigated.10−15 In the early stages of VCD research, emphasis was placed on spectra–structure
correlations and qualitative interpretations. In this connection,
the methine-hydrogen bending mode has been suggested to generate a
VCD band with its sign correlating with the absolute configuration
(AC) in a series of related compounds. This observation was further
investigated16 for (S)-1-methylindan
and (R)-1-methylindan-1-d and (R)-1-aminoindan, by measuring the experimental vibrational absorption
(VA) and VCD spectra for neat liquid samples and identifying the VCD
associated with methine-hydrogen (or deuterium) bending mode. The
sign of VCD band associated with methine-hydrogen bending mode in
these three indans was also suggested16 to correlate with the AC.

In recent years, the advances in
VCD theory17−19 and quantum
chemical (QC) computational methods20,21 have shifted
the focus of VCD research to interpreting the experimental VCD spectra
using QC predictions of corresponding spectra and deducing the chiral
molecular structures therefrom. This approach has facilitated probing
not only the AC but also the molecular conformational space, in a
variety of systems, containing both small and large molecules. The
availability of faster computer processors with larger memory and
storage space has led to the use of molecular dynamics (MD) for generating
the geometries of solute–solvent clusters and simulating the
QC-predicted spectra for solvated species.22−24 Attempts to
analyze the experimental chiroptical spectra using corresponding QC-predicted
spectra have now become a routine practice.25 Recent works have also emphasized on quantitative comparisons between
experimental and calculated spectra using the similarity index26 and spectral similarity overlap (SSO) plots.27−29

The puckering of a five-membered ring common to substituted
indans
can shed light on the role of ring puckering conformation on VCD spectra.
The contributions to vibrational absorption (VA) and VCD spectra from
the ring puckering conformations have not been identified before,
and there is a need to identify conformer-specific VA and VCD bands.
Second, (R)-1-aminoindan has a freely rotatable amino
group whose influence on VCD spectra needs to be explored. A similar
situation, with a freely rotatable O–H group, exists for (S)-1-indanol whose experimental VA and VCD spectra in CCl4 and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvents were reported recently.30 In this manuscript, we identify the puckering
conformer-specific VA/VCD bands in 1-methylindans and the conformational
sensitivity of rotatable NH2/OH groups to VA/VCD spectra.
In addition, comparison of the experimental and QC-predicted VA and
VCD spectra of (S)-1-methylindan, (R)-1-methylindan-1-d, (R)-1-aminoindan, and (S)-1-indanol, using quantitative SSO measures, are carried
out.

Investigations presented here on four 1-substituted indans
lead
to consistent conclusions as follows: (a) the positive ring puckering
of a five-membered ring, leading to a pseudoequatorial substituent
at the 1-position, dominates the contributions to VCD spectra in all
molecules. Nevertheless, evidence for the signatures of negative ring
puckering, leading to a pseudoaxial substituent, is also present in
the experimental spectra. (b) Even though the rotatable NH2 and OH substituents at 1-position add additional conformational
complexity, the observed VA and VCD spectra are reproduced remarkably
well by QC predictions at the optimized geometries. (c) Hydrogen-bonding
DMSO solvent facilitates the formation of the 1-indanol/DMSO complex,
requiring exploration of numerous conformers. Even then, with proper
care in probing the conformational space, the experimental spectra
of 1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex are remarkably
well reproduced by QC predictions at the optimized geometries. (d)
The excellent correlation of experimental spectra with corresponding
QC-predicted spectra, obtained for all four substituted indans, including
for a complex with a hydrogen-bonding solvent, identifies successful
pathways for future chiral molecular structure determination.

Results
and Discussion
The details on the conformational analysis,
QC predictions of VA
and VCD spectra, and spectral similarity analysis are given in the Methods section.

(S)-1-Methylindan
Relaxed energy scan
(see the Supporting Information) for 1-methylindan
as a function of 9–4–3–2 dihedral angle (see Figure 1) using the B3LYP
functional31−33 and 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set,34 indicates two minima at +17 and −15°. Thus,
two conformers with opposite ring puckering angles are possible for
this molecule. The energies and populations of these conformers for
the isolated molecule are summarized in Table 1. These conformers, along with atom numbering
for identifying the ring puckering angle, are shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Two conformers of (S)-1-methylindan with opposite
puckering of the 5-membered ring. Positive 9–4–3–2
dihedral angle leads to methyl group in the pseudoequatorial position
and in pseudoaxial position for negative 9–4–3–2
dihedral angle.

The conformation with
a positive 9–4–3–2 dihedral
angle has the lowest Gibbs energy and is expected to be present with
∼75% population in vacuum. The experimental VA and VCD spectra
obtained for the neat liquid sample are compared to the population-weighted
QC-predicted spectra for the isolated molecule in Figure 2.

Figure 2 Comparison of experimental
and predicted VA (bottom panel), VCD
(middle panel), and vibrational dissymmetry factor (VDF, top panel)
spectra for (S)-1-methylindan. Although the experimental
VA spectra are shown until 1425 cm–1, the experimental
VCD was not displayed above 1320 cm–1 due to excessive
absorbance present in the 1325–1425 cm–1 region.
The left vertical panels display overlaid spectra after scaling the
calculated vibrational frequencies with 0.9785, whereas the right
vertical panels display stacked spectra with unscaled vibrational
frequencies and labeled band positions. Experimental VA and VCD spectra
are taken from ref (16).

In Figure 2, the
left vertical panels display predicted spectra with vibrational frequencies
scaled with 0.9785 (which corresponds to maximum SSO of VCD spectra)
as overlaid with experimental spectra whereas the right vertical panels
provide stacked display of predicted spectra with unscaled frequencies.
From the overlaid experimental and predicted spectra, it can be seen
that the predicted spectra faithfully reproduce the bands seen in
the experimental spectra and band-by-band correlation in experimental
and predicted spectra can be seen. The correlation of experimental
(and corresponding unscaled predicted) VA band positions (in cm−1 units) noted from the stacked spectra is as follows:
1372 (1412), 1326 (1349), 1299 (1330), 1263 (1293), 1211 (1235), 1154
(1183), 1077 (1100), 1020 (1044), 1012 (1029), 950 (969), and 928
(950). Similarly, the correlation of experimental (and corresponding
unscaled predicted) VCD band positions is as follows: 1301 (1329),
1275 (1302), 1262 (1293), 1212 (1236), 1166 (1194), 1157 (1174), 1075
(1100), 1065 (1082), 1019 (1045), 1013 (1026), 967 (976), and 900
(910). This comparison indicates that almost all experimental bands
are satisfactorily reproduced in the predicted spectra. The same type
of correlation can also be seen in VDF spectra, as is clearly apparent
from the overlaid spectra.

The agreement between experimental
and predicted spectra is quantified
using maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values (see SSO plots in Figure 3A), which are respectively, 0.87, 0.65, and
0.66 for (S)-1-methylindan. The SimVCD and SimVDF values obtained here are excellent,
because these higher magnitudes are not that routine, and for typical
cases, they can be as low as ∼0.4.35

plots (A–F) for investigated substituted indans.

Since there are two ring puckering conformers,
it is useful to
understand how the experimental spectra are influenced by the individual
conformers. The spectra predicted for individual conformers and their
Boltzmann population-weighted spectra are compared to the experimental
spectra in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Comparison of individual conformer and population-weighted predicted
VA (left panel), VCD (right panel) with corresponding experimental
spectra of (S)-1-methylindan. The predicted frequencies
are scaled as in Figure 2. Experimental VA and VCD spectra are taken from ref (16).

From this comparison, it can be seen that the major VA and
VCD
spectral features seen in the experimental spectra have counterparts
in those predicted for the conformation with a positive puckering
angle (#1 in Table 1). However, it is important to note that the presence of both conformers
is required for reproducing the experimental positive–negative
bisignate VCD couplet (positive at 1075 and negative at 1065 cm–1), with positive VCD mostly coming from conformer
1 and negative VCD mostly coming from conformer 2. Similarly, the
presence of both conformers is required for reproducing the experimental
weak negative–positive bisignate VCD couplet (negative at 1166
and positive at 1157 cm–1), with negative VCD mostly
coming from conformer 1 and positive VCD coming from conformer 2.
This information on conformer-specific VCD bands is useful for future
investigations on temperature-dependent conformer equilibrium and
associated thermodynamic parameters.

(R)-1-Methylindan-1-d
Note that the
substitution of hydrogen atom with deuterium does not alter the conformational
space or the optimized geometries. However, Gibbs energies and hence
populations of conformers can be different upon deuterium substitution.
The energies, populations, and ring puckering angles for the two conformers
are summarized in Table 2.

2	–388.2609	0.61	0.26	–15.2	
The deuterium substitution
has changed the populations of the two
conformers only slightly. The conformer with the positive 9–4–3–2
dihedral angle is now expected to be present with ∼74% population
(as opposed to 75% in 1-methylindan) in vacuum. The experimental VA
and VCD spectra obtained for the neat liquid sample are compared to
the population-weighted QC-predicted spectra for isolated molecules
in Figure 5. In the
left vertical panels of Figure 5, predicted spectra with vibrational frequencies scaled with
0.978 (which corresponds to the maximum SSO of VCD spectra) are overlaid
on experimental spectra. In the right vertical panels of Figure 5, predicted spectra
with unscaled vibrational frequencies are stacked above experimental
spectra and individual band peak positions are labeled. As with (S)-1-methylindan, it can be seen that the predicted spectra
faithfully reproduce the bands seen in the experimental spectra for
(R)-1-methylindan-1-d, and band-by-band correlation
in experimental and predicted spectra can be seen. The correlation
of experimental (and corresponding unscaled predicted) VA band positions
noted from the stacked spectra is as follows: 1375 (1413), 1307 (1340),
1259 (1291), 1196 (1220), 1155 (1179), 1083 (1105), 1020 (1042), 971
(979), and 942 (960). Similarly, the experimental (and the corresponding
unscaled predicted) VCD band positions are as follows: 1296 (1324),
1266 (1293), 1202 (1223), 1171 (1193), 1098 (1121), 1072 (1091), 1023
(1041), 971 (979), and 941 (960). This comparison indicates that almost
all of the experimental bands are satisfactorily reproduced in the
predicted spectra. The same type of correlation is apparent in the
overlaid VDF spectra.

Figure 5 Comparison of experimental and predicted VA (bottom panel),
VCD
(middle panel), and VDF (top panel) spectra for (R)-1-methylindan-1-d. Although the experimental VA spectra are shown
until 1425 cm–1, the experimental VCD was not displayed
above 1345 cm–1 due to excessive absorbance present
for the 1375 cm–1 band. The left vertical panels
display overlaid spectra after scaling the calculated vibrational
frequencies with 0.978, whereas the right vertical panels display
stacked spectra with unscaled vibrational frequencies and labeled
band positions. Experimental VA and VCD spectra are taken from ref (16).

The agreement between experimental and predicted spectra
is quantified
using maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values (see SSO plots in Figure 3B), which are, respectively, 0.92, 0.72,
and 0.66. These values are even better than those for (S)-1-methylindan (see the comparison in Table 3) and reflect the excellent agreement between
experimental and predicted spectra.

Baseline ε
tolerance used in obtaining VDF spectra are: 0.7, 0.5, 2, 1.4, and
0.5, respectively, for 1-methylindan, 1-methylindan-1-d, 1-aminoindan,
1-indanol in CCl4, and 1-indanol in DMSO-d6.

As with (S)-1-methylindan, the role of two individual
conformer contributions to the experimental spectra of (R)-1-methylindan-1-d can be analyzed. For this purpose, the predicted
spectra for two individual conformers and their population-weighted
average are compared to the experimental spectra in Figure 6. The dominant VCD features
seen in the experimental spectrum are clearly present in the predicted
spectrum of conformer with a positive puckering angle (#1 in Table 2). For example, the
dominant positive–negative bisignate VCD couplet with positive
VCD at 1098 cm–1 and negative VCD at 1072 cm–1 originates predominantly from conformer #1. It is
of interest to note that the signs of intense VCD bands of conformer
#2 are opposite to those of conformer #1. As a result, the experimental
intensities of bisignate VCD couplets (1296(−)/1266(+) and
1202(−)/1171(+)) of (R)-1-methylindan-1-d
can be seen to result from a significant reduction of the VCD band
intensities of conformer #1 by the opposing contributions from conformer
#2. As with (S)-1-methylindan, this information on
conformer-specific VCD bands is useful for future investigations on
temperature-dependent conformer equilibrium and associated thermodynamic
parameters.

VA (left panel), VCD (right panel) with corresponding experimental
spectra for (R)-1-methylindan-1-d. The predicted
frequencies were scaled as in Figure 5. Experimental VA and VCD spectra are taken from ref (16).

(R)-1-Aminoindan
The energies, populations,
and ring puckering angles for the six conformers of 1-aminoindan are
summarized in Table 4. The structures are displayed in Figure 7. Conformers 5, 3, and 1, with pseudoequatorial
orientation (positive ring puckering angle) contribute to 80% of the
population. Thus, as with 1-methylindans, the pseudoequatorial orientation
is predicted to be the dominant contributor to vibrational spectra.

1, 3, and 5 have positive 9–4–3–2 dihedral angles,
whereas the other three have negative dihedral angles. See Table 4 for relative energies
and populations of these conformers.

The experimental VA and VCD spectra obtained for the
neat liquid
sample are compared to the population-weighted QC-predicted spectra
for isolated molecules in Figure 8. The predicted VA and VCD spectra of individual conformers
are presented in the Supporting Information. In the left vertical panels of Figure 8, predicted spectra with vibrational frequencies
scaled with 0.977 (which corresponds to maximum SSO of VCD spectra)
are overlaid on experimental spectra. In the right vertical panels
of Figure 8, predicted
spectra with unscaled vibrational frequencies are stacked above experimental
spectra and individual band peak positions are labeled. As with (S)-1-methylindan and (R)-methylindan-1-d,
it can be seen that the predicted spectra faithfully reproduce the
vibrational bands seen in the experimental spectra.

Figure 8 Comparison of experimental
and predicted VA (bottom panel), VCD
(middle panel), and VDF (top panel) spectra for (R)-1-aminoindan. The experimental region above 1450 cm–1 is associated with excessive absorbance and not displayed. The left
vertical panels display overlaid spectra after scaling the calculated
vibrational frequencies with 0.977, whereas the right vertical panels
display stacked spectra with unscaled vibrational frequencies and
labeled band positions. Experimental VA and VCD spectra are taken
from ref (16).

The correlation of experimental
(and corresponding unscaled predicted)
VA band positions noted from the stacked spectra is as follows: 1377
(1413), 1317 (1349), 1296 (1327), 1259 (1293), 1215 (1240), 1184 (1204),
1153 (1175), 1121 (1141), 1101 (1120), 1070 (1080), 1019 (1044), 971
(985), and 953 (956). Similarly, the correlation of experimental (and
corresponding unscaled predicted) VCD band positions is as follows:
1378 (1413), 1274 (1303), 1259 (1288), 1223 (1243), 1179 (1207), 1121
(1144), and 948 (959). Quantification of the agreement between experimental
and predicted spectra can be gleaned from SSO plot (see Figure 3C and Table 3), where the maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values are,
respectively, 0.89, 0.60, and 0.47. The SimVCD and SimVDF magnitudes for 1-aminoindan are slightly smaller
than those for 1-methylindan and 1-methylindan-1-d, which is probably
because of the additional conformational degrees of freedom arising
from the NH2 group (each of the two puckered ring conformers
is associated with three different orientations of the NH2 group). Nevertheless, the agreement between experimental and predicted
VA and VCD spectra of 1-aminoindan is remarkably good.

It is
useful to note that the liquid-phase experimental spectra
are satisfactorily reproduced by gas-phase calculations for 1-methylindan,
1-methylindan-1-d, and 1-aminoindan. This observation raises the relevance
of solute–solute interactions in condensed media. Although
polarizable continuum model (PCM)36 calculations
might not be useful for shining light on this issue, liquid-phase
MD simulations might be able to.37

(S)-1-Indanol in Nonhydrogen-Bonding Solvent,
CCl4
Whereas six stable conformations were found
for 1-aminoindan, only four initial conformations of different energies
were generated by CONFLEX.38 To avoid missing
the remaining two conformations, we have manually recreated the six
conformations and optimized their geometries at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
level, followed by VA and VCD calculations at the same level of theory.
These six conformers are identical to those reported recently by Zehnacker
et al.30 The geometries of conformers for
(S)-1-indanol were also optimized, with PCM36 representing CCl4 solvent at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
level, followed by VA and VCD calculations at the same level of theory.
The use of PCM has only a minor influence on conformational populations
and predicted spectra, as already pointed out by Zehnacker et al.30 For this reason, the comparison of experimental
spectra is restricted to the QC-predicted spectra obtained with PCM
(see Table 5, Figures 9 and 3).

The experimental VA, VCD, and VDF spectra obtained for (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 are compared to the population-weighted

with unscaled vibrational frequencies are stacked above experimental
spectra and individual band peak positions are labeled. There is a

spectra is as follows: 1605 (1640), 1475 (1506), 1458 (1492), 1381

1465 (1508), 1384 (1422), 1303 (1337), 1270 (1303), 1246 (1275), 1212
(1224), 1181 (1205), 1134 (1155), 1088 (1106), 1055 (1072), 1024 (1040),
and 960 (966).

The overlaid VA and VCD spectra show an excellent
match in the
1350–900 cm–1 region of the experimental
spectrum. But neither VA nor VCD has a good match in the 1350–1450
cm–1 region of the experimental spectrum, mainly
because the predicted VA spectrum has very large intensity at ∼1420
cm–1 compared to that of the corresponding experimental
VA band at ∼1381 cm–1. The same discrepancy
appears between the corresponding predicted VCD at ∼1422 cm–1 and experimental VCD at 1384 cm–1. The maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values obtained, for the 900–1700 cm–1 region of the experimental spectrum (Figure 3D and Table 3), are 0.86, 0.43, and 0.36, respectively. Of these, SimVCD and SimVDF values are not as large
as those seen for (S)-1-methylindan, (R)-1-methylindan-1-d, or (R)-1-aminoindan. The reason
for lower SSO values for (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 is due to the mismatch of the large intensities associated
with the predicted band at ∼1420 cm–1. Both
absorption and VCD intensities predicted at ∼1420 cm–1 are significantly higher than the corresponding intensities observed
in the experiment. If the region of similarity analysis is restricted
to 900–1350 cm–1 region of the experimental
spectra, then the SimVA, SimVCD,
and SimVDF values increase to 0.94, 0.63, and 0.62,
respectively (see Figure 3E), which are better than those for 1-aminoindan and closer
to those of 1-methylindans (see Table 3). The higher VA and VCD intensities predicted at ∼1420
cm–1 originate from coupled O–H and C–H
bending motions at 1-position.

VA and VCD spectra of (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 have been analyzed previously
by Zehnacker et al.30 They reported predicted
spectra using the B3LYP
functional and 6-31++G(d,p) basis set and adopting two different approaches:
(1) conventional static optimized geometries, nuclear velocity perturbation
(NVP) theory39−41 for calculating VCD, and PCM for representing the
CCl4 solvent. This approach was referred to as static optimized
geometry method. (2) Ab initio molecular dynamics for capturing the
dynamical behavior of solute configurations, optimizing the geometries
of snapshots extracted from the MD trajectories and NVP theory for
predicting VCD. This approach was referred to as first-principle molecular
dynamics (FPMD) method. The analysis of Zehnacker et al.30 was limited to qualitative visual comparison
of selected VCD bands. Their focus was on large intensities predicted
for the ∼1420 cm–1 band and incorrect relative
intensities predicted for the negative doublet at ∼1200 cm–1. Although these discrepancies were considered to
have been corrected in their FPMD calculations,30 the following negative points in the FPMD predictions can
be noticed: the predicted spectrum in the FPMD approach did not show
bands corresponding to the experimental positive VCD doublet at ∼1088
and 1055 cm–1; the FPMD-predicted spectrum also
did not reproduce the experimental negative VCD band at 1465 cm–1 (instead the FPMD-predicted spectrum showed a negative
VCD couplet; positive on the higher frequency side and negative on
the lower frequency side) in the 1425–1475 cm–1 region. Thus, although FPMD calculations may have appeared to have
corrected the deficiencies associated with the predicted band intensities
at ∼1420 and 1200 cm–1, two other regions
(1000–1100 and 1400–1500 cm–1) of
the experimental spectra were negatively influenced. As a result,
the overall spectral similarity between FPMD-predicted and experimental
VCD spectra of (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 appears
less than desired.

The current simulated spectra at the B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
level,
using conventional static optimized geometries, match the experimental
spectra in the 1350–900 cm–1 region (see Table 3 and Figure 3E, and overlaid spectra in Figure 9) and also the 1450–1480
cm–1 region (see overlaid spectra in Figure 9) reasonably well. The discrepancy
associated with higher intensities predicted for the ∼1420
cm–1 band of (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 (compared with the corresponding experimental intensities),
however, remains to be resolved.

It appears then that, identifying
a method to correct for the overestimated
intensities predicted for ∼1420 cm–1 band
for 1-indanol in CCl4, without negatively influencing other
regions of the spectra, will be useful. We pursued different directions
for this purpose.

First, we followed the recent findings of
Nicu et al.,42 where the overestimated
intensities in the 1160–1380
cm–1 region for vibrations involving C–O–H
bending in 3-methyl-1-(methyldiphenylsilyl)-1-phenylbutan-1-ol could
be satisfactorily corrected by averaging over the spectra obtained
for thermal fluctuations in C–O–H angle. Taking cues
from this study, we changed the C–O–H angle in the fully
optimized geometries of 1-indanol conformers in three steps of +2°
increment each and three steps of −2° increment each and
performed constrained geometry optimizations. Some of the resulting
geometries with positive increments were found to have imaginary frequencies.
The Gibbs energy-derived Boltzmann population-weighted spectra, including
those of additional C–O–H angle variations that did
not have imaginary frequencies, are then compared to the experimental
spectra and similarity analyses performed. Unfortunately, these results
(SimVA = 0.80, SimVCD = 0.40, and SimVDF = 0.36 for the 900–1700 cm–1 region; see the SI) also did not provide
improvement over the spectra shown in Figure 9 and Table 3.

Second, individual conformer spectra (see the SI) indicate that out of the four lowest energy
conformers,
two of the conformers (C5 and C4) make dominant contributions to VA
intensity and three conformers (C5, C4, and C3) make dominant contributions
to VCD intensity at 1420 cm–1. The C6 conformer
does not contribute to this band. Assuming that Boltzmann populations
determined from Gibbs energies may not be reflecting the actual populations
in the experiment, we considered the following: (a) the populations
derived from electronic energies (see the footnote to Table 5); (b) equal populations for
all six conformers, and (c) the influence of increasing the population
of C6 and decreasing C4. With these altered populations, spectra were
simulated for each case and similarity analysis carried out. The spectra
derived from populations with electronic energies yielded slightly
inferior similarity values (SimVA = 0.84, SimVCD = 0.41, and SimVDF = 0.36) for the
900–1700 cm–1 region. The simulated spectra
with equal populations yielded lower intensities for the 1420 cm–1 band and improved overall quantitative similarity
for the 900–1700 cm–1 region in VA and VCD
spectra slightly (SimVA = 0.87 and SimVCD = 0.48), but simVDF has decreased from 0.36
to 0.28. When the population of C6 was increased and that of C4 decreased,
via the combination C5(0.29), C6(0.27), C3(0.14), C4(0.1), C2(0.1),
and C1(0.1), the predicted intensities of the 1420 cm–1 band were lowered and some improvement was found for the similarity
values for the 900–1700 cm–1 region (SimVA = 0.88, SimVCD = 0.46, and SimVDF = 0.40; see the SI) compared
to those in Table 3. It turned out to be difficult to improve the similarity values
further without negatively influencing the VCD doublet at ∼1088
and 1055 cm–1. Thus, a satisfactory procedure for
fully correcting the overestimated intensities of the 1420 cm–1 band of 1-indanol in CCl4, without negatively
influencing other regions of spectra, remained elusive. Even if a
different combination of populations happens to improve the similarity
values, the task of finding experimental proof for such hypothesized
populations remains to be undertaken.

(S)-1-Indanol
in a Hydrogen-Bonding Solvent,
DMSO-d6
To analyze the experimental
spectra of (S)-1-indanol obtained in DMSO-d6 solvent, two different calculations are undertaken:
(a) one set of calculations is carried out with PCM representing the
DMSO solvent. However, PCM cannot realistically represent the solute–solvent
interactions, especially when hydrogen bonding is involved.43 (b) DMSO solvent has very high propensity for
forming hydrogen bonds with solute molecules containing O–H
and N–H groups, and in such cases, successful reproduction
of experimental spectra by the predicted spectra without incorporating
explicit solvent molecules becomes a challenge. For this reason, an
explicit DMSO molecule is added in two different orientations to each
of the six conformations of (S)-1-indanol. These
complexes are optimized at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p) level with PCM representing
DMSO solvent environment. The complexed DMSO molecule in each of the
optimized structures is then rotated to 90, 180, and 270° around
the hydrogen bond to explore the conformational space of the 1-indanol/DMSO
complex. This process led to investigating a total of 48 conformers.
The optimized 30 lowest energy structures at B3LYP/6-311++G(2d,2p)
level, with PCM representing DMSO solvent environment, are used for
VA and VCD calculations on the 1-indianol/DMSO-d6 complex at the same level of theory, and none of these structures
had imaginary vibrational frequencies. The energies, populations,
and dihedral angles associated with these 30 conformers are presented
in Table 6 and conformer
structures displayed in Figure 10.

complexes. See Table 5 for relevant dihedral angles.

Table 6 lists some
conformers with nearly the same C9–C4–C3–C2 and
C9–C1–O–H dihedral angles. For example, the five
lowest energy conformers (#18, #14, #38, #16, and #12) have nearly
the same C9–C4–C3–C2 and C9–C1–O–H
dihedral angles, making one wonder if they are in fact distinctly
separate conformers. In this connection, it is useful to note that
the orientation of DMSO molecules can be different even for the same
C9–C4–C3–C2 and C9–C1–O–H
dihedral angles. For this reason, an additional dihedral angle C1–O···O=S,
relating the C1–O bond of the parent molecule to the S=O
bond of the solvent molecule is also included in Table 5. With the three dihedral angles
listed, one can identify the differences in conformers that have the
C9–C4–C3–C2 and C9–C1–O–H
dihedral angles. However, even with the use of these three dihedral
angles, the two higher energy structures #41 and #43 do not appear
to be significantly different. But they are in fact different in terms
of the inversion at S atom of the solvent molecule (see Figure 10).

It is
important to note that (S)-1-indanol/DMSO
complexes adopt both positive and negative ring puckering angles for
the five-membered ring, with 77% population contribution coming from
the conformers with positive ring puckering angle. Also, since O–H
group can have free rotation around C–O bond, the hydrogen-bonded
DMSO molecule is in a different relative orientation with respect
to the parent molecule. This should not be viewed as a hydrogen-bonded
DMSO molecule rotating with O–H group; instead, this could
be viewed as a different DMSO molecule from the solvent bath hydrogen
bonding to O–H in a different orientation.

The experimental
VA and VCD spectra of 1-indanol in DMSO-d6 solvent are compared to the population-weighted
QC-predicted spectra for 1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex in Figure 11, and SSO plots are displayed in Figure 3F. The excellent correlation between experimental
and predicted spectra features is surprising, given that modeling
hydrogen-bonding interactions with the solvent is often challenging.43 The correlation of experimental (and predicted)
spectra is as follows. In VA spectra: 1602 (1633), 1476 (1488), 1457
(1456), 1323 (1332), 1284 (1316), 1261 (1284), 1209 (1225), 1178 (1204),
1151 (1172), and 1101 (1109); in VCD spectra: 1479 (1509), 1466 (1491),
1418 (1453), 1300 (1356), 1289 (1319), 1266 (1283), 1212 (1227), 1182
(1204), 1136 (1160), and 1101 (1109). Of these, there are three places
where some differences are apparent: The weak positive VCD band at
1300 cm–1 seen in the experimental spectrum does
not match in sign with the predicted VCD at 1356 cm–1. The weak negative experimental VCD band at 1289 cm–1 is not as well developed as the corresponding predicted negative
VCD at 1319 cm–1. The weak positive VCD band seen
in the experimental spectrum at 1241 cm–1 is not
resolved in the predicted spectrum.

Figure 11 Comparison of experimental and predicted
VA (bottom panel), VCD
(middle panel), and VDF (top panel) spectra for (S)-1-indanol–DMSO-d6 complex. The
left vertical panels display overlaid spectra after scaling the calculated
vibrational frequencies with 0.9825, whereas the right vertical panels
display stacked spectra with unscaled vibrational frequencies and
labeled band positions. Experimental VA and VCD spectra are taken
from ref (30) with
permission from the Royal Society of Chemistry.

Except for the differences associated with weak bands mentioned
above, the overlaid VA and VCD spectra show good match in the entire
1700–1100 cm–1 region of the experimental
spectrum. The quantification of this match is reflected in a similarity
analysis (see Figure 3H and Table 3), which
yields 0.89, 0.61, and 0.66 for SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF, respectively. The SimVCD and SimVDF values obtained here are better than
those for 1-aminoindan and 1-indanol in CCl4. Also, the SimVDF value obtained for 1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex is larger than that for 1-aminoindan and as
high as that for 1-methylindan and 1-methylindan-1-d.

VA and
VCD spectra of (S)-1-indanol in DMSO-d6 have been analyzed previously by Zehnacker
et al.30 They reported predicted spectra
using NVP theory, B3LYP functional, and 6-31++G(d,p) basis set adopting
different approaches: (1) conventional static optimized geometries
and PCM representing the DMSO solvent continuum; (2) conventional
static optimized geometries for 1:1 indanol/DMSO complex and PCM representing
the DMSO solvent continuum; (3) conventional static optimized geometries
for 1:2 indanol/DMSO complex and PCM representing the DMSO solvent
continuum; and (4) FPMD for capturing the dynamical behavior of 1-indanol
in a box of DMSO solvent molecules, optimizing the geometries of snapshots
extracted from the MD trajectories. Optimization of snapshots from
FPMD trajectories resulted in both pseudoequatorial and pseudoaxial
conformers and provided improved comparison between predicted and
experimental VCD spectra, although disagreement (resulting from a
large negative doublet in the predicted spectrum) in the region around
1300 cm–1 still persisted.30

The main point leading to the differences in the previous
and present
results can be associated with the following aspect: in the previous
conventional static optimized geometry calculations,30 only four major geometries of the 1:1 indanol/DMSO complex,
all with pseudoequatorial orientation of O–H group, were considered
for VCD predictions on 1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex. This is different from the current finding that nearly
30 different static geometries (with 77% population coming from pseudoequatorial
conformers and 23% from pseudoaxial) are needed to describe the 1-indanol/DMSO
conformational space. The critical point to recognize here is that
rotating the O–H group around C–O bond and complexing
a DMSO molecule in each of the new O–H orientations is important
for exploring the conformational space of the 1-indanol/DMSO complex.
With these precautions, the present conventional static optimized
geometry calculations can be seen to be a successful (see Table 3, Figure 3 and overlaid spectra in Figure 11) alternative to
FPMD simulations in reproducing the experimental VCD spectra in the
1700–1100 cm–1 region of the 1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex. This observation should not be interpreted
as discouraging the general use of MD simulations, because the analyses
of solution-phase spectra using MD geometries have certainly helped
in many situations.22−24

Conclusions
(S)-1-Methylindan,
and (R)-1-methylindan-1-d
have just two conformations resulting from opposite ring puckering
angles. Ring puckering conformer populations that result in pseudoequatorial
vs pseudoaxial substituent are in the ratio of ∼80:20. Ring
puckering conformer-specific VCD bands could be clearly identified
in the experimental spectra of 1-methylindans, and pseudoaxial contribution
is important for reproducing the experimental spectra. (R)-1-Aminoindan and (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 have six conformations, resulting from the rotation of the NH2/OH substituent for each of the two ring puckering conformations.
On the contrary, (S)-1-indanol in DMSO has numerous
hydrogen-bonded conformations with ∼80% arising from ring puckering
that results in the pseudoequatorial substituent and ∼20% from
the pseudoaxial substituent. The QC-predicted spectra for the minimum
energy geometry optimized conformers of (S)-1-methylindan,
(R)-1-methylindan-1-d, (R)-1-aminoindan,
and (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 and (S)-1-indanol/DMSO-d6 complex
are found to be in excellent agreement with corresponding experimental
VA and VCD spectra. The methods to correct overestimated VA and VCD
intensities for the ∼1420 cm–1 band of 1-indanol
in CCl4, without negatively influencing other regions of
spectra, however, remain to be identified.

Methods
Conformational
Analysis and QC-Predicted Spectra
For
all molecules studied here, an initial conformational search was conducted
using CONFLEX,38 unless otherwise stated.
Final optimizations were carried out using B3LYP functional31−33 and 6-311++G(2d,2p) basis set,34 as implemented
in the Gaussian program,44 followed by
QC prediction of VA and VCD at the same level. VCD spectra were obtained
using magnetic field perturbation theory,17−19 as implemented
in the Gaussian 09 program.44 The QC-predicted
spectral intensities were Boltzmann population-weighted using Gibbs
free energies and spectra simulated using Lorentzian band profiles
with 10 cm–1 band width. For all four indan molecules
considered, calculations were done for the (S) configuration.
Since experimental spectra were reported for the (R)-enantiomers of 1-methylindan-1-d and 1-aminoindan, the corresponding
calculated VCD spectra were multiplied by −1 for comparison
to the experimental spectra. The comparisons between experimental
and QC-predicted spectra and similarity analysis were carried out
using CDSpecTech.28,29 SSO plots were also generated
using CDSpecTech.

Spectral Similarity Overlap (SSO) Plots
SSO was calculated
using the Sim function suggested by Shen et al.45 The Sim function is given as35 1  In eq 1, hXXX(x) represents the experimental spectrum as a function
of
the running index for x-axis values; subscript XXX represents the type of spectrum (XXX = VA, VCD, VDF); fXXX(σ:x) represents the simulated predicted spectrum
obtained after scaling the predicted transition frequencies/wavelengths
with a scale factor σ; SimXXX(σ) represents
the numerical measure of SSO between experimental and predicted spectra
as a function of σ, for the type of spectrum XXX; the integrals run over the spectral region of interest. The display
of SimXXX(σ) as a function of σ is referred
to as the SSO plot.27,29 For similarity analysis, VA,
VCD, and VDF spectra are normalized individually using square root
of the sum of squared intensities.

The range for SimVCD, as well as SimVDF, values is −1 to +1.
A value of +1 indicates perfect agreement of experimental spectra
with predicted spectra of correct AC. A value of −1 indicates
perfect agreement of experimental spectra with predicted spectra of
AC, opposite to that used for calculations. The range for SimVA values is 0–1 and does not relay information
on the AC.

We have previously advocated that the analysis of
VCD spectra,
without accompanying absorption spectra, is not appropriate. Furthermore,
although separate evaluations of QC predictions of VA and VCD spectral
intensities may appear satisfactory, the VDF (ratio of VCD to VA)
spectra are more challenging for QC predictions. For this purpose,
we have advocated the quantitative analysis of experimental and predicted
VDF spectra to verify the agreement between them.27−29,46−48 The agreement between experimental
and predicted spectra is quantified using maximum SimVA, SimVCD, and SimVDF values in
SSO plots. While SimVA value comes out to be generally
high and not very discriminatory, SimVCD and SimVDF values provide good measures of quantitative agreement
between experiment and QC predictions of VCD and VA. Achieving a SimVCD value of +0.4 or higher is recommended for an acceptable
agreement between experimental and calculated spectra for assigning
the correct molecular structures.35 Approximately
the same value of SimVDF is also recommended.

VDF has the advantage that it is not influenced by errors in concentration
and path length, when both VA and VCD spectra are measured simultaneously
for the same sample and using the same instrument. The influence of
baseline off-sets and of VCD magnitude calibration error is suppressed
during the calculation of SimVDF by normalizing the
intensities in VDF spectra. This process can only take care of the
situation where the experimental baseline offset is constant as a
function of the wavenumber and experimental VCD magnitudes are off
by a constant as a function of the wavenumber. If the VCD baseline
is not horizontal, then VDF will not appear normal and cannot be used.
That is why, it is important to have a good reliable experimental
VCD spectrum before proceeding to calculate VDF.

Two considerations
are taken into account in calculating VDF spectra:
(a) baseline tolerance for absorption spectra and (b) reliability
criterion for experimental VDF signals, which we previously referred
to as the robustness criterion based on experimental ΔA/A values. Baseline tolerance for absorption
spectra helps remove the amplification of noise in the regions where
absorbance is nearly zero and the associated VCD signal is only noise.
The choice for absorption baseline tolerance influences only small
regions of spectra for the molecules considered (for example, the
region around 1400 cm–1 for 1-aminoindan). The choice
for reliability criterion for experimental VDF signals can vary from
instrument to instrument and for individual research groups. In the
past, we have been using 40 ppm (i.e., ΔA/A = 4 × 10–5) as the threshold for
reliability, in which case spectral regions with VDF less than 40
ppm are blanked out, giving the appearance of spectral discontinuities
in VDF spectra. To avoid the appearance of such unpleasant spectral
discontinuities, the VDF spectral analysis presented in this manuscript
did not impose any reliability criterion for experimental VDF signals.
For the interested readers, VDF spectra with 40 ppm reliability criterion
are presented in the Supporting Information. The SimVDF values, in general, did not change
significantly with and without reliability criterion (compare Table 3 and Table S1 in the SI). For 1-indanol in CCl4, SimVDF has improved when the reliability criterion is not
imposed.

Experimental Spectra
The experimental
spectra of (S)-1-methylindan, (R)-1-methylindan-1-d,
and (R)-1-aminoindan were reported previously16 where all spectra were recorded for neat liquids
in absorbance units, but y-axis values cannot be
discerned with sufficient quantitative accuracy. The spectra for (S)-1-indanol in CCl4 and in DMSO-d6 solvents were reported by Zehnacker et al.,30 where y-axis values were not
available. These literature experimental VA and VCD spectra were digitized
using WebPlotDigitizer49 and normalized
for carrying out similarity analyses. The excessive level of absorbance
in some spectral regions restricted the analysis of experimental VCD
spectra to the following regions: 925–1320 cm–1 for 1-methylindan; 920–1345 cm–1 for methylindan-1-d;
950–1450 cm–1 for 1-aminoindan; 900–1700
cm–1 for 1-indanol in CCl4; and 1100–1700
cm–1 in DMSO-d6. The y-axes values in the displayed VA and VCD spectra are those
of predicted spectra in molar extinction units; VDF spectral intensities
are presented as ppm. The experimental spectral intensities were scaled
to be on the same scale as those for predicted spectra.
