Homogeneous Sc(OTf)3 used
in nitromethane showed excellent
catalytic activity for the direct allylation reactions of general
alcohols including benzylic, propargylic, allylic, and some aliphatic
alcohols with allyltrimethylsilane under mild and neutral reaction
conditions. Metal-free β-silyl-substituted carbocations are
intermediates generated by the highly oxophilic Sc(OTf)3-assisted rapid removal of a hydroxyl group in alcohols, which is
supported by the result that allylation of (R)-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethan-1-ol
with allytrimethylsilanes using the Sc(OTf)3 catalyst combined
with (R)- or (S)-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-diol
ligands gave only racemic 2-(pent-4-en-2-yl)naphthalene in quantitative
yield. The present study resolves the argument about the uncertain
catalytic activity of Sc(OTf)3.

Introduction
Rare-earth-metal triflates
are promising Lewis acids that promote
the fundamental and synthetically important carbon–carbon bond-forming
reactions, including the aldol reaction, Mannich-type reaction, Diels–Alder
reaction, Friedel–Crafts reaction, and 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition
reaction even in water1 and ionic liquid
solvents.2

The direct substitution
reaction of a hydroxyl group in alcohols
with allylsilanes is one of the most atom-efficient carbon–carbon
bond-forming reactions because it does not require the prior conversion
of a hydroxyl group in alcohols into a good leaving group such as
acetate, trifluoroacetate, carbonates, or ethers/acetals using catalysts
(Lewis acids (FeCl3, Fe(OTf)3, InCl3/I2, and B(C6F5)3), Brønsted
acids (2,4-dinitrobenzenesufonic acid and o-benzenedisulfonimide),
and late transition metals ([RhCl(η4-1,5-cyclooctadiene)]2)).3 Since Cella reported the first
direct allylation of benzylic and allylic alcohols with allylsilanes
in the presence of an excess amount of BF3·Et2O in 1982,4 [(Et2NSF2)BF4] (XtalFluor-E)-5 and TiCl46-mediated reactions
have been reported. The same reaction proceeded smoothly with the
use of a catalytic amount of HN(SO2F)27 and I2/XB donor.8 Besides, many Lewis acid-catalyzed direct allylation reactions
of mainly secondary and tertiary benzylic alcohols with allylsilanes
have been developed, in which InCl3,9 InCl3/Me3SiX,10 InBr3,11 ZrCl4,12 Ca(NTf2)2/Bu4NBF4,13 FeCl3·6H2O in water,14 BiCl3,15 Bi(OTf)3 in ionic liquid,16 and solid acids such
as H-montmorillonite,17 Sn-montmorillonite,18 and phosphomolybdic acid19 are used as a catalyst. However, some of the reported reactions
have several drawbacks such as variable yields, a prolonged reaction
time from minutes to hours, the need for cooling (−78 °C)
or heating (100 °C) under an inert atmosphere, difficult work
up, stoichiometric or excess amount of some Lewis acids and Brønsted
acids, and the formation of significant amounts of byproducts such
as ethers through the intermolecular dehydration of benzylic alcohols.
In this context, the development of more efficient catalysts for the
direct allylation of general alcohols with allylsilanes remains attractive.

De and Gibbs reported the low catalytic activities of both Sc(OTf)3 and ScCl3 for the direct allylation of benzhydrol
with allyltrimethylsilanes.15 Independently,
Yasuda and Baba also reported the low catalytic activity of Sc(OTf)3 for the same reaction,9 whereas
Yadav and co-workers reported that Sc(OTf)3 showed catalytic
activity for the related allylation of both secondary propargylic
and allylic alcohols with allylsilanes.20 On the other hand, we recently developed a novel synthesis of 4(3H)-quinazolinones by the Yb(OTf)3-catalyzed cyclo-condensation
of 2-aminobenzamides with carboxamides21 or 1,3-dicarbonyl compounds.22 As a continuation
of our study on the development of novel and unique rare-earth-metal
triflate-catalyzed synthetic organic transformations, we considered
that the low solubility and homogeneity of Yb(OTf)3 and
Sc(OTf)3 in CH2Cl2 may highly affect
their catalytic activity as well as the reproducibility of the reactions.
Because of the above uncertain catalytic activity of Sc(OTf)3, in the present study, we clarified the extremely high catalytic
activity of Sc(OTf)3 under the most suitable reaction conditions.

Results
and Discussion
We re-examined the catalytic activities of
general metal triflates
including rare-earth-metal triflates in several solvents in the model
allylation of 1-phenylethan-1-ol 1a with allyltrimethylsilane 2a to give pent-4-en-2-ylbenzene 3a at room temperature
for 3 h under an argon atmosphere. The results are summarized in Table 1, and among the catalysts
examined, Sc(OTf)3 gave the desired 3a in
86% yield (Table 1,
entry 1).

yield (isolated yield).

c No reaction occurred, and 1a was completely recovered.

d When the amount of 2a was reduced from 3.0 to 2.0 mmol, di(1-phenylethan-1-yl)ether from
dehydration of two molecules of 1a was obtained in ca.
30% yield as only byproduct. No formation of styrene, dehydrated product
of 1a, was confirmed by careful GC–MS analysis
(vide infra).

In sharp contrast,
no reaction occurred with Sc(OAc)3 or ScCl3 (entries
9 and 10) probably because of the weak
coordination ability as well as the lower electron-withdrawing effects
of chloro- and acetato-ligands compared to a triflato-ligand.21,22 Fe(OTf)3 also showed high catalytic activity to give 3a in 85% yield (entry 4), whereas less Lewis acidic metal
triflates including Fe(OTf)2 showed almost no catalytic
activity (entries 2, 3, 5–8).23 We
consider that the most important reason why previous studies concluded
that Sc(OTf)3 has low catalytic activity is the low solubility
of Sc(OTf)3 in CH2Cl2, leading to
low reproducibility. The effect of the solvent was examined (entries
12, and 14–19), and the results showed that nitromethane (CH3NO2) was the best solvent for Sc(OTf)3 catalyst to give 3a, quantitatively, with good reproducibility
and acceleration of the reaction (entry 12). Consequently, Sc(OTf)3 is the best catalyst for the direct allylation of 1a with 2a in a highly polar solvent, CH3NO2, to give 3a, quantitatively with good reproducibility.

Primary, secondary, and tertiary benzylic alcohols as well as 2-thiophenemethanol
were applicable to the present Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed direct
allylation reaction with allyltrimethylsilane 2a in CH3NO2 (Table 2).24 Under optimum and neutral
reaction conditions, the present allylation reactions of secondary
benzylic alcohols 1a–i with 2a went
to completion at room temperature within 10 min, and the desired products 3a–i were obtained in high yield without the formation
of byproducts such as α-methylstyrene, its dimers, or indans.4,25

Table 2 Sc(OTf)3-Catalyzed Direct
Allylation of Secondary Benzylic Alcohols with 2a in
CH3NO2
Direct allylation of tertiary benzylic alcohols with 2a gave (2-methylpent-4-en-2-yl)benzene 4a and
but-3-ene-1,1,1-triyltribenzene 4b bearing a quaternary
carbon center in respective yield
of 94%. Primary benzylic alcohols as well as thiophen-2-ylmethanol
were also allylated, smoothly, at 80 °C for 10 min to give 5a–f in high yield, where electron-donating substituents
(Me and MeO) on a phenyl ring had a positive effect (Table 3). This result suggests that
the present reaction proceeds via a benzylic cation intermediate (vide
infra).

Table 3 Sc(OTf)3-Catalyzed Direct
Allylation of Tertiary and Primary Benzylic Alcohols with 2a in CH3NO2
In addition, the direct allylation of primary, secondary,
and tertiary
propargylic alcohols with 2a proceeded to give the corresponding
hex-5-en-1-yn-1-ylbenzenes 6a–d in good to high
yield (Table 4). Diallylation
of two hydroxyl groups in 4-methyl-1-phenylpent-2-yne-1,4-diol with 2a also proceeded, successfully, and after the reaction at
room temperature for 24 h, the corresponding diallylated product,
(7,7-dimethyldeca-1,9-dien-5-yn-4-yl)benzene 6e, was
obtained in 78% yield (eq 1). 1,5-Dienes such as 3-allylcyclohex-1-ene 7a and (E)-hexa-1,5-diene-1,3-diyldibenzene 7b were
obtained in respective yields of 65 and 83% by the Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed direct allylation of cyclohex-2-en-1-ol and (E)-1,3-diphenylprop-2-en-1-ol with 2a, respectively. 1  

Table 4 Sc(OTf)3-Catalyzed Direct
Allylation of Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Propargylic Alcohols
with 2a
Surprisingly, aliphatic alcohols such as 1-adamantanol,
cyclohexanol,
and cyclopentanol were also allylated with 2a at 80 °C
for 3 h to give the corresponding allylated products 8a–c in moderate-to-high yield (Table 5). In addition, the present allylation of 2-phenylethan-1-ols
with 2a gave only linear products 8d–g in high yields with high selectivity (vide infra).

Table 5 Sc(OTf)3-Catalyzed Direct
Allylation of Aliphatic Alcohols with 2a
To investigate the mechanism, Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed allylation
of 1-phenylpropan-2-ol with 2a was examined, and a mixture
of (2-methylpent-4-en-1-yl)benzene 9a and hex-5-en-3-ylbenzene 3f was obtained in a total isolated yield of 47% (9a/3f = 55/45) (eq 2). 2  

The mechanism of
the reaction depicted in eq 2 is as follows (Scheme 1). The removal of a hydroxyl group in the
starting 1-phenylpropan-2-ol by Sc(OTf)3 catalyst occurs
to give 1-phenylpropan-2-yl cation, which may rapidly be captured
and highly stabilized by the neighboring phenyl group to form two
isomeric intermediates A and B.26 However, another possible carbocation intermediate C is not involved in the present reaction, because hex-5-en-2-ylbenzene
generated from the intermediate C was not obtained at
all (vide infra). At the lower reaction temperature such as room temperature,
the rate of the allylation of the intermediates A and/or B with 2a to 9a is faster than that
of the allylation of the open-chain 1-phenylpropan-1-yl cation, which
was formed by the rearrangement (1,2-hydride shift) of 1-phenylpropan-2-yl
cation, with 2a to 3f. This mechanism can
explain that the present reaction gave the mixture of 9a and 3f, and the yield of 9a was higher
than that of 3f (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Possible Mechanism of the Reaction Depicted in Eq 2
On the other hand, the Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed direct
allylation
of 2-arylethan-1-ols with 2a gave only linear allylated
products, 8d–8g. This reaction also starts from
the removal of a hydroxyl group in the starting 2-arylethan-1-ols
by Sc(OTf)3 catalyst occurs to give a 2-arylethan-1-yl
cation, which may rapidly be captured and highly stabilized by the
neighboring phenyl group to form three isomeric intermediates D, E, and D′ (D = D′). In sharp contrast to the phenonium ion
intermediate B in Scheme 1, the rapid Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed ring-opening
allylation of the cyclopropane in E with 2a from either site, prior to the formation of the open-chain 1-arylethan-1-yl
cation intermediate through the slow rearrangement (1,2-hydride shift)
of 2-arylethan-1-yl cation intermediate, would proceed to give the
linear allylated products 8d–8g without the formation
of the branched allylated products (vide supra) (Scheme 2).27

Scheme 2 Possible Mechanism for Selective Formation of the Linear Allylated
Products 8d–g from 2-Arylethan-1-ol
The reaction of 1-phenylethan-1-ol 1a with (1-chloroallyl)trimethylsilane 2b gave
(5-chloropent-4-en-2-yl)benzene 10 in
66% yield (E/Z = 69/31), in which
the reaction occurred at the sterically less hindered γ-allylic
carbon atom in 2b (eq 3).

In addition, Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed
allylation of (R)-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethan-1-ol (>99%
ee) with 2a in either the presence or the absence of
chiral ligands such as
(R)- or (S)-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-diol
and (R)- or (S)-[1,1′-binaphthalene]-2,2′-diyl
bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) gave only racemic product 3g, quantitatively, without a decrease in catalytic activity (eq 4).28 3   4  

These results indicate that the present reaction
proceeds via a
metal-free carbocation intermediate, generated from the starting (R)-1-(naphthalen-2-yl)ethan-1-ol and subsequent allylation
with 2a occurs according to an SN1-type mechanism.

As the control experiments, we examined the reaction of styrene
(1.0 mmol), with 2a (3.0 mmol) in the presence of Sc(OTf)3 catalyst (0.050 mmol) in CH3NO2 (2.0
mL) at rt for 30 min. However, no reaction occurred, and styrene was
completely recovered. In addition, the reaction of 1a (1.0 mmol) with Sc(OTf)3 catalyst (0.050 mmol) in CH3NO2 (2.0 mL) in the absence of 2a at
rt for 30 min gave a trace amount of di(1-phenylethan-1-yl)ether,
and no styrene was formed. These results clearly indicate that no
dehydration of the starting alcohols 1 to alkenes occurred
under the present catalytic reaction conditions, and the present reaction
does not involve an alkene intermediate.

On the basis of all
of the above results, the most plausible mechanism
for the present Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed direct allylation of 1a with 2a is illustrated in Scheme 3. First, a highly oxophilic
Sc(OTf)3 coordinates to an oxygen atom in 1a to promote the elimination of a hydroxyl group as –Sc(OTf)3(OH),29 which generates
a carbocation. Immediate nucleophilic attack of 2a to
the generated carbocation gives a β-silyl-substituted carbocation,
which is stabilized by the β-effect of silicon30,31 because of a favorable interaction between the cation vacant p-orbital
and the adjacent C–Si σ-bond. –Sc(OTf)3(OH) then returns to a catalytic cycle, and nucleophilic attack
of Si by –Sc(OTf)3(OH) occurs to give
the desired 3a and Me3SiOH as a byproduct,
with the regeneration of an active Sc(OTf)3 catalyst. A
careful gas chromatography (GC)–mass spectrometry (MS) analysis
revealed that the dehydrative dimerization of Me3SiOH occurred
rapidly under the present reaction conditions to give 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexamethyldisiloxane
((Me3Si)2O), quantitatively.

Scheme 3 Plausible Mechanism
Conclusions
In
conclusion, we have developed homogeneous Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed
practical direct allylation reactions of general alcohols
such as benzylic, allylic, and propargylic alcohols as
well as several aliphatic alcohols under extremely mild and neutral
reaction conditions, which proceed via a β-silyl group-stabilized
carbocation as an intermediate to give the desired allylated products
in high yield with high efficiency. Homogeneous Sc(OTf)3 catalyst dissolved completely in CH3NO2 and
showed excellent and stable catalytic activity with high reproducibility
in the present reaction. Consequently, this study resolves the argument
about the uncertain catalytic activity of Sc(OTf)3. Further
studies on the Sc(OTf)3-catalyzed direct functionalization
of alcohols with other silyl compounds bearing functional groups are
in progress in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
General Information
Alcohols, allylsilanes, and nitromethane
used in this study were dried and purified before use by standard
procedures. 4-Methyl-1-phenylpent-2-yne-1,4-diol32 and (1-chloroallyl)trimethylsilane 2b(33) were prepared as described in the literature.
Metal triflates including Sc(OTf)3 were purchased from
commercial sources and used as received without further purification,
unless otherwise noted. Dry CH2Cl2, toluene,
and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were obtained by passing them through activated
alumina columns of solvent-purification systems from Glass Contour
Inc. under an argon atmosphere.

NMR spectra were recorded on
a JEOL EX-400 spectrometer (400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz
for 13C NMR) or JEOL AL-300 spectrometer (300 MHz for 1H and 75 MHz for 13C NMR). Samples were analyzed
in CDCl3, and the chemical shift values were described
relative to tetramethylsilane. GC analysis was carried out on a gas
chromatograph equipped with a glass column (2.6 mm i.d. × 3.1
m) packed with SE-30 (5% on Uniport HP, 60–80 mesh), and GC
yield was determined by using naphthalene or biphenyl as an internal
standard. GC–MS analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Parvum2
mass spectrometer connected to a Shimadzu GC-2010 gas chromatograph
[column: J&W Scientific fused silica capillary column DB-1 (column
dimensions: 0.249 mm i.d. × 30 m, film thickness: 0.25 μm)].
High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured with a JEOL JMS-700
(EI) or Thermo Fischer Scientific Exactive spectrometer (APCI). Elemental
analysis was carried out at the Center for Organic Elemental Microanalysis,
Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Science, Kyoto University. Medium-pressure
column chromatography was performed with a Shoko Scientific Purif-α2k
equipped with a Moritex Purif-Pack (SI 60 μm and spherical)
using hexane/ethyl acetate as an eluent. High-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis was performed using a Shimadzu Prominence equipped
with a commercial chiral column at 25 °C with a UV detector at
254 nm. Hexane (HPLC grade) was used as an eluent.

mmol, 5.0 mol %), alcohol (1.0 mmol), allyltrimethylsilane
(342 mg, 3.0 mmol), and nitromethane (2.0–5.0 mL) was stirred
under the reaction conditions noted in the text. After the reaction
was complete, it was poured into dichloromethane or methanol (20 mL),
and the samples were analyzed by GC and GC–MS. All products
were purified by medium-pressure column chromatography and/or Kugelrohr
distillation.

In the present
reaction,
only Sc(OTf)3 showed high catalytic activity and no catalytic
activity was observed for other rare earth metal triflates including
Y(OTf)3 and Yb(OTf)3 in the present reaction
(Table 1). We now consider
that these results are highly depending on the characteristics of
the Sc3+ ion which is the smallest rare earth metal ion
with the highest Lewis acidity, see: Mikami K. ; Terada M. ; Matsuzawa H.
