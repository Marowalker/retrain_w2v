Several
studies have shown that the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) inhibitor; everolimus (EV) improves patient survival in several
types of cancer. However, the meaningful efficacy of EV as a single
agent for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC) has failed to be
proven in multiple clinical trials. Combination therapy is one of
the options that could increase the efficacy and decrease the toxicity
of the anticancer therapy. This study revealed that the β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD):FGF7 complex has the potential to improve the antiproliferative
effect of EV by preventing FGF receptor activation and by enhancing
EV cellular uptake and intracellular retention. Molecular docking
techniques were used to investigate the possible interaction between
EV, β-CD, and FGF7. Molecular docking insights revealed that
β-CD and EV are capable to form a stable inclusion complex with
FGF at the molecular level. The aqueous solubility of the inclusion
complex was increased (3.1 ± 0.23 μM) when compared to
the aqueous solubility of pure EV (1.7 ± 0.16 μM). In addition,
the in vitro cytotoxic activity of a FGF7:β-CD:EV complex on
Caco-2 cell line was investigated using real-time xCELLigence technology.
The FGF7:β-CD:EV complex has induced apoptosis of Caco-2 cells
and shown higher cytotoxic activity than the parent drug EV. With
the multitargets effect of β-CD:FGF7 and EV, the antiproliferative
effect of EV was remarkably improved as the IC50 value
of EV was reduced from 9.65 ± 1.42 to 1.87 ± 0.33 μM
when compared to FGF7:β-CD:EV complex activity. In conclusion,
the findings advance the understanding of the biological combinational
effects of the β-CD:FGF7 complex and EV as an effective treatment
to combat CRC.

==== Body
Introduction
The inhibition of mTOR-signaling
pathway is considered a key element
in the anticancer therapy of various tumors.1 Previously, we reported that PEGylated rapamycin in the form of
micelles exhibited a high in vitro cytotoxicity activity in human
gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines.2 Several
observations have suggested that EV could be effective against CRC
and carcinomatosis.3 However, the meaningful
efficacy of EV as a single agent for the treatment of CRC has failed
to be proven in multiple clinical trials.4,5 It
is important to note that stomatitis because of the mTOR-inhibitors
therapy occurs soon after the treatment starts. According to the National
Cancer Institute, stomatitis, mouth ulceration, and lip ulceration
are the most common serious adverse events (SAE) associated with the
EV treatment with an incidence of 44%.6 The combining effect of several strategies along with the chemotherapy
for different-level tumor targeting is a promising therapeutic technique
to combat the disease and to reduce associated SAE.7 Because cancer cell membrane acts as a barrier for most
anticancer agents, achieving both targeting and stealth features for
selective and effective tumor drug delivery is always a challenge.
However, various multitargeting approaches have the potential to overcome
this challenge. Several studies have reported that the tumor-selective
accumulation of antitumor agents is achievable through the use of
targeting molecules such as ligands, antibodies, nucleic acids, or
peptides by improving recognition, permeability, and internalization
of anticancer drugs by the target tissues.8

Inhibiting circulating angiogenic factors such as the vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)
leads to decrease cell survival, migration, and proliferation in cancer
cells.9 In particular, increased levels
of FGF are detectable in patients with colorectal cancer, which could
relate to the density of the tumor and recurrence after resection.10 The signaling molecule keratinocyte growth factor
(KGF), also known as FGF7, binds to fibroblast growth factor receptor
2b (FGFR2b) and involves in the tumor growth and tissue repair with
epithelial-cell specificity.11 Currently,
FGF7 is being used for its protective ability to epithelial cells
to prevent chemoradiotherapy-associated stomatitis.12 The protein kinase B, also known as Akt pathway, has been
shown to be activated by FGF7. Observations have revealed that the
FGF7 activation of the Akt pathway, along to its protective ability
from cell apoptosis in the majority of epithelial cells, could also
induce differentiation and/or cell cycle arrest in certain cell types.
Therefore, it can be postulated that the balance between different
signaling cascades of FGF7 leads to various and even opposite roles
of this growth factor on cell growth.13,14 In most normal
and cancerous colonic mucosa samples, FGF7 and its receptor were detected
with an overexpression of the receptor observed in the tumor cells.15 According to the Human Protein Atlas (HPA) database,
FGFR2b is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract with an
overexpression in Caco-2 cells.16 On the
other hand, HPA has reported that no FGF7 production was detected
at the protein level in Caco-2 cells.17 Furthermore, it has been reported that combining mTOR and FGFR inhibitors
successfully inhibited cell signaling and motility in hepatocellular
carcinoma cells and impaired tumor growth in vivo.10

Virtually all cancer patients initially respond to
antitumor drugs
such as antiangiogenics or mTOR-inhibitors, but within few months
of therapy initiation they become nonresponsive.18 In the event of the treatment-targeting VEGF pathway, treatment-induced
elevated tumor hypoxia often occurs, which leads to the production
of a different proangiogenic mediators such as FGFs at the tumor microenvironment
that lead to drug-related acquired resistance and poor prognosis.19 Observations suggested that the impermeability
of tumor cell membrane to most molecules diminishes the cellular uptake
of anticancer drugs. Previous studies reported that no difference
in EGFR-overexpressing tumor accumulation time or the biodistribution
of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies when compared
to nontargeted therapy.20,21 Thus, the difference
in tumor distribution between nontargeted and targeted therapies could
be evaluated by the efficient cellular uptake and retention of the
drug instead of tissue-specific targeting. In this sense, the function
of the targeting ligand is to prevent the potential drug clearance
by tumor cells rather than to enhance the recognition at the targeted
site. On that basis, several peptides and ligands-based delivery strategies
of anticancer agents have been investigated.22−24 These agents
bind directly to a receptor overexpressed in a tumor cell and consequently
improve the permeation, cellular uptake, and intracellular retention
of the anticancer drug.22

In the
present work, molecular-modelling tasks and in silico analysis
techniques were utilized to design a new class of a potential anticancer
complex to improve the efficacy of EV in CRC cells. Thereby, this
study has demonstrated the in vitro cytotoxic activity of the FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex on the Caco-2 cell line using real-time xCELLigence technology.

Molecular Modeling Studies
Prediction of β-CD:EV Inclusion Complex
Formation
Molecular modeling studies for β-CD and EV
interaction was
performed using AutoDock Vina1.1.2. Evidence from docking scores suggested
the best molecular docked conformation model of the β-CD:EV
inclusion complex with a binding affinity of −5.31 kcal mol–1, which indicates good binding between β-CD
(Figure 1A) and EV
(Figure 1B) as well
as good stability of the complex due to H-bonding (Figure 2).26,27

and EV:H116-β-CD:O10 with a distance of 2.57 Å.

Binding Ability of β-CD and EV to FGF
Molecular
docking was performed via the molecular-operating environment (MOE.2014)
software for β-CD and EV in the heparin binding site of a basic
fibroblast growth factor (1BFB.pdb)28 with
scoring affinity London dG and GBVI/WSA dG. The amino acids (Asn 28,
Lys 120, Arg 121, Lys 126, Lys 136) interact with the native ligand
(heparin tetramer fragment) in the binding site (Figure 3A). The docking free energy
score for EV in the bind pocket of IBFB is −4.4615 (95% CI
of mean = −4.795, −4.328) with RMSD = 1.772 (95% CI
of mean = 1.981, 3.682) kcal/mol. EV was able to interact with Lys
126-forming two H-bonds (Figure 3B). Additionally, β-CD was able to bind to the
1BFB binding site with a docking free energy score of −5.2439
(95% CI of mean = −4.572, −3.740) and RMSD = 1.978 (95%
CI of mean = 2.174, 3.258) kcal/mol. The visualization of the interaction
in the binding pocket indicated that Arg 121 formed four H-bonds with
the OH groups located in different sugar rings, although Lys 126 formed
a single H-bond with OH group (Figure 3C).

FGF Binding with β-CD:EV Inclusion
Complex
The
binding ability of FGF (1BFB.pdb) to the inclusion complex was assessed
also using Patchdock server, clustering RMSD was set at 4.0. Simulation
results have suggested that FGF tends to bind with the inclusion complex
(Figure 4A) through
van der Waals, electrostatic, H-bonds, and hydrophobic interactions
(Figure 4B) with a
binding affinity of −179.39 kcal mol–1 and
a binding score of 6864. Moreover, β-CD shows interaction with
Ala58, Glu60, Gly 62, Arg61, Leu99, and Glu97 amino-terminal residues
of FGF (Figure 4B).

Preparation of Water-Soluble FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex
Inclusion complex of β-CD:EV was prepared in the 2:1 M ratio
of β-CD and EV. The water solubility of the inclusion complex
was measured by UV–Vis spectrometer and λmax of the pure EV in ethanol was found to be 267 nm. The absorbance
of water-soluble β-CD:EV complex was recorded at 280 nm, because
the λmax shift of the UV–Vis absorption of
EV was observed after the formation of the inclusion complex.29 The aqueous solubility of the inclusion complex
was 3.1± 0.23 μM, whereas the aqueous solubility of pure
EV was 1.7± 0.16 μM. In addition, the FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex was prepared by a physical adsorption method, as a result
of hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interaction, by dissolving the
FGF7 and β-CD:EV complex in ultra-pure water followed by freeze-drying
to obtain the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex in powder form.

FTIR Characterization
of FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex
The FGF7:β-CD:EV complex
was characterized by a FTIR spectrophotometer.
FTIR spectrum of the complex was analyzed and compared with the spectra
of the pure compounds and their physical mixture. The FTIR spectrum
of EV shown characteristic peaks at 3410 cm–1 (OH)
and 2931 cm–1 (−CH3), 1642 cm–1 (C=O), and 1448 cm–1 (−C–O–C−)
(Figure 5A).30 On the other hand, The FTIR spectrum of β-CD
shown characteristic peaks at 3295.22 cm–1 (asymmetric
and symmetric stretching of OH), 2919.62 cm–1 (asymmetric
stretching from CH2) and 1333 cm–1 (coupled
in plane bending of CH2), Figure 5B.31 The physical
mixture spectrum of EV and β-CD has represented all the characteristic
peaks of both compounds (Figure 5D). The characteristic peaks of EV in the inclusion
complex were completely vanished, indicating that the EV molecule
was entirely inserted into the β-CD cavity (Figure 5E).32−34 The FTIR spectrum
of interaction of the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex shows the characteristic
peak 1334 cm–1 of β-CD along with the characteristic
peak 1532 cm–1 (strong N–O stretching) of
FGF7 (Figure 5F).

Assessment of FGF7:β-CD:EV
Complex Stability and EV Release
Profile
FGF7:β-CD:EV complex stability in Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (DMEM) culture media and the release of EV from
the complex were measured by utilizing size restricted dialysis tubing
procedure (Figure S1). Figure 6 represents the release profile
of EV from both the pure EV sample and FGF7:β-CD:EV complex
sample. The results revealed that after 15 min, around 27% of the
pure EV sample was detected in a receiver compartment (Figure 6). On the other hand, up to
30 min of experiment, there was no detection of free EV from the FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex sample in the receiver compartment, and about 35% of free
EV was detected after 1 h.

Dynamic Monitoring of Cytotoxic Activity Using RTCA DP Instrument
To evaluate the antiproliferative efficacy of different EV complexes
on Caco-2 cells, EV, FGF7:EV, β-CD:EV inclusion complex, and
FGF7:β-CD:EV complex with an EV concentrations of 3.26, 6.52,
and 13.04 μM were incubated with Caco-2 cells for 96 h, and
the cell viability was measured by an RTCA DP instrument. Figure 7 represents the concentration-dependent
cytotoxicity of EV on Caco-2 cells for over 96 h incubation time.
EV exhibited an IC50 value of 9.65 ± 1.42 μM
after 96 h incubation time.

be 3.81 ± 0.82 μM after 96 h incubation time.

The cytotoxicity of β-CD:EV
was lower than the parent drug

96 h incubation time (Figure 9).

time.

Target identification software
Swiss suggested that β-CD
could possess a cytotoxic effect. For this reason, β-CD and
β-CD-FGF were tested on Caco-2 cell line. As a result, β-CD
appeared to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cell line with IC50 (5.11
μM). Adding β-CD and FGF together decreased the IC50 value to 2.73 μM. Interestingly, the cytotoxicity
of EV was remarkably improved when combined with exogenous β-CD
and FGF7, P < 0.001 (Figure 10). Figure 11 represents the cytotoxic activity of EV for each respective
complex on Caco-2 cell line after 96 h incubation time.

Cytotoxicity of FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex on Normal Cells
In this study, the normal human fetal small intestinal (FHs 74
Int, ATCC CCL-241) cell line was used to investigate the cytotoxicity
of FGF7:β-CD:EV complex on normal human cells, and the cell
viability was measured by a RTCA DP instrument. Figure S2 represents the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity
of EV on FHs 74 Int cells. The Pure EV sample has exhibited an IC50 value of 19.25 ± 1.35 μM for over 72 h incubation
time. The cytotoxicity of FGF7:EV and β-CD:EV complexes on FHs
74 Int cells was found to be similar to pure EV with IC50 values of 15.9 ± 0.95 and 16.55 ± 1.05 μM, respectively
(Figures S3 and S4). On the other hand,
the cytotoxicity of the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex on FHs 74 Int cells
was found to be lower (IC50 = 34.11 ± 1.9 μM)
(Figure S5) when compare to the pure EV
sample, P < 0.0001, mainly due to the fact that
EV is less exposed to the cell because of its inclusion inside β-CD.

Assessment of FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex Retention in Caco-2
Cells
A 2D monolayer cell culture method was used to evaluate
the drug uptake and retention in Caco-2 cells. The first 30 min of
exposure was not considered because of the release time delay between
two applications of EV to the tumor cells. The observations from Figure S6 indicated that the penetration of EV
from both pure and complex samples was time-dependent, thus the intracellular
accumulation of EV was significantly increased with FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex application, P < 0.05, only ∼2.5%
of free EV from the complex sample and ∼6% of the pure EV sample
was detected extracellularly after 6 h. The retention of EV was enhanced
with the complex application also. After 24 h of exposure, ∼3.5%
of free drug was detected from cells treated with the complex sample,
and ∼7% from cells treated with the pure EV sample.

Discussion
The causes of the failure of mTOR inhibitor EV as a monotherapy
antitumor agent still remain unclear,35,36 but several
observations have linked it with cancer cell membrane barriers, P-gp
active efflux transporter or multidrug resistance-associated proteins.37 β-CD has been reported to increase the
retention and accumulation of mTOR inhibitors in Caco-2 cells by significant
decrease in the efflux ratio, suggesting the inhibition of P-gp-mediated
efflux transport.38−40 Besides, increasing the retentions of mTOR inhibitors,
we want to identify the molecular targets of β-CD. A Swiss target
identification analysis was used to identify β-CD molecular
targets. Swiss suggested that β-CD is capable to bind to FGF1
and FGF2. This could be supported by the strong affinity of a similar
structure (β-CD tetradecasulfate) toward FGF.41 Heparin is essential for FGF to generate a biological
response by binding to a FGF receptor. Heparin functions by binding
to several FGF molecules forming FGF oligomerization. Then the FGF-heparin
complex bind to couple of FGFRs, this leads to FGFR dimerization,
which activates tyrosine kinase pathway (Figure 12A). A study showed that synthetic heparin
analog, which can only bind to one FGF, blocks the dimerization of
FGFR, thus stop its activation. We propose that β-CD antagonizes
the action of heparin by binding to only one FGF; therefore, it cannot
induce FGF oligomerization thus preventing FGFR dimerization.42,43 This prevent FGFR activation and suppresses the intracellular cascades
of FGFR, leading to cell growth inhibition (Figure 12B).

Figure 12 (A) Heparin induced FGF oligomerization
and activate FGFR. (B)
β-CD or EV binds to only one FGF preventing FGFR dimerization.

In the current work, the influence
of exogenous FGF7 and β-CD
on the cytotoxic activity of the parent drug EV was investigated in
Caco-2 cell line. Molecular modeling studies were performed to predict
the binding affinity of the FGF:β-CD:EV complex. First as shown
in Figure 2, Ligand–ligand
docking was performed using Autodock vina. An EV molecule was successfully
docked into β-CD cavity with a binding affinity of −5.3
kcal mol–1. Because hydroxyl groups surround the
narrow opening of β-CD, EV binding with this narrow opening
of β-CD indicates possibility of H-bonding between EV oxygen
atoms and hydroxyl groups of β-CD near the narrow opening. In
addition, MOE was used to dock β-CD and EV (individually) in
the heparin binding site of FGF (IBFB) with docking free energy score
of −5.2439 and – 4.4615, respectively (Figure 3). FGF has shown a binding
affinity of −179.39 kcal mol–1 to the β-CD:EV
inclusion complex through van der Waals, electrostatic, H-bonds, and
hydrophobic interactions (Figure 4), suggested a good stability of FGF:β-CD:EV
complex.

In this study, β-CD was utilized to enhance the
aqueous solubility
of EV. Hence, the therapeutic application of the majority of anticancer
drugs is severely limited because of their poor water-solubility and
inadequate cancer cell penetration.44,45 β-CD
is capable to form a stable inclusion complex with EV at molecular
level based on hydrophobic interactions as the EV molecule inserts
into the β-CD cavity.45,46 The aqueous solubility
of the inclusion complex was increased by (3.1± 0.23 μM)
when compared to the aqueous solubility of pure EV (1.7 ± 0.16
μM). FTIR studies indicate that a new structure was formed,
and the EV molecule was entirely embedded into the β-CD cavity
(Figure 5E) as the
characteristic peaks of EV were completely vanished.32−34 Furthermore, the interaction of FGF7 with the β-CD:EV inclusion
complex was determined also. There was a shifting of the broad classic
band of β-CD from 3295.22 to 3287 cm–1, indicating
a possibility of H-bonding between FGF7 and the inclusion complex
as suggested by the molecular modeling scores (Figure 4). The FGF7:β-CD:EV complex stability
in a DMEM media and the release of EV were measured by dialysis tubing
procedure (Figure S1). Up to 30 min of
experiment, there was no detection of free EV from the FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex sample in a receiver compartment, and about 35% of free EV
was detected after 1 h time. This indicated that the complex is stable
in DMEM for at least 30 min and exhibits sustain release profile (up
to 4 h).

RTCA xCELLigence technology results revealed that when
cells are
treated with EV alone, the IC50 value was 9.65 ± 1.42
μM. Treating cells with FGF and EV resulted in increase in the
cytotoxicity significantly with IC50 (3.81 ± 0.82
μM) (P < 0.05) compare to EV alone. Considering
the molecular docking result, we believe that part of the EV molecules
binds to FGF and inhibiting FGF oligomerization, whereas the rest
goes inside the cells and act as mTOR inhibitor. This can be supported
by β-CD and β-CD:FGF cytotoxicity results. In our view
when cells are treated with β-CD alone (IC50 = 5.11
μM), β-CD tries to substitute heparin from the existing
FGF in the cells preventing FGF oligomerization; however, by adding
both β-CD and FGF together, they decreased the IC50 value to 2.73 μM by directly working as a complex to block
FGFR, preventing more receptors to be activated. The IC50 value of β-CD:EV was higher than that of EV, suggesting that
conjugation significantly affect EV efficacy (P <
0.01), possibly due to the slow release profile of EV from the inclusion
complex.47,48 Interestingly, the cytotoxicity of the β-CD:EV
inclusion complex was remarkably improved when combined with FGF7, P < 0.001 (Figure 10) with a dramatic decrease in the IC50 value
from 17.71 ± 1.42 to 1.87 ± 0.33 μM. Hence, FGF7 facilitated
the intracellular delivery of EV. Also, according to the molecular
docking result, both EV and β-CD are capable to bind in the
heparin binding site of FGF; however, β-CD has a higher binding
score and has more hydrogen bonds compare to EV. We assume that in
the presence of the β-CD and FGF, most of EV molecules are able
to enter the cells and act as an mTOR inhibitor, whereas β-CD
binds to FGF and inhibits its oligomerization. Therefore, the multitargets
effect of the complex facilitating the cellular uptake of EV, preventing
FGF receptors activation, and enhancing the intracellular retention
of EV. The antiproliferative effect of EV in Caco-2 cells was remarkably
improved as the least IC50 value was obtained with the
FGF7:β-CD:EV complex. Lastly, the concentration-dependent cytotoxicity
of pure EV and FGF7:β-CD:EV complex on FHs 74 Int normal cell
line was studied. A pure EV sample exhibited an IC50 value
of 19.25 ± 1.35 μM at over 72 h incubation time. The cytotoxicity
of the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex on FHs 74 Int cells was found to
be lower (IC50 = 34.11 ± 1.9 μM) when compare
to the pure EV sample, P < 0.0001, mainly due
to the fact that EV is less exposed to the cell because of its inclusion
inside β-CD.

Conclusions
Molecular modeling tasks
and in silico analysis techniques were
utilized to design a new class of a potential anticancer complex to
improve the efficacy of EV in the Caco-2 cell line. This study demonstrated
that a FGF7:β-CD complex dramatically improved the antiproliferative
effect of the mTOR inhibitor EV by enhancing its cellular uptake,
intracellular retention, and through preventing FGFR activation thus
preventing cell proliferation and possessed less toxicity in the FHs
74 Int normal human cell line. These findings advance the understanding
of the biological combinational effects of the β-CD:FGF7 complex
and EV as an effective therapeutic to combat CRC.

Materials and
Methods
Cell Culture and Reagents
Caco-2 HTB-37 (ATCC, USA),
FHs 74 Int (ATCC, USA), streptomycin/penicillin solution (Gibco, USA),
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, USA), and trypsin/EDTA (Gibco,
USA), β-Cyclodextrin (Sigma Aldrich, USA), Dulbecco’s
modified eagle medium (ATCC, USA), fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA),
and EV (Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada).

Target Identification of
β-CD and EV
Swiss predicts
the molecular targets of small molecules based on their 2D and 3D
similarity by comparing the query molecule to a library of 280 thousand
compounds. SMILES of β -CD and EV were obtained from PubChem
and were entered into Swiss target software to predict the molecular
targets of β-CD and EV.49

Molecular
Modeling Studies
Molecular modeling studies
were performed to predict the formation of β-CD:EV, FGF7:β-CD,
and FGF7:EV complexes and to measure their binding affinity by utilizing
AutoDock Vina 1.1.2,50 PatchDock server,51,52 and MOE.2014 software, which are available from the Chemical Computing
Group (CCG; www.chemcomp.com). The 3D structures of EV (PubChem CID: 6442177)53 and β-CD (PubChem CID: 444041)54 were obtained from NCBI PubChem compound database where
the structural complex of FGF7 (PDB ID: 1BFB)28 was retrieved from RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). All structures
of the selected compounds, served as molecules for modeling studies,
were optimized through MOE.2014 software before docking. Hydrogen
atoms and partial charges were added to the protein. Protein minimization
was performed in gas solvation with the side chains, keeping it rigid
and the ligand flexible.55 The selected
site was isolated and minimized, followed by protonating the protein.
The 3D ligands were minimized using MMFF94x with cutoffs of 10 to
12 Å. The hydrogens and charges were fixed, and the RMS gradient
was set to 0.001 kcal/mol.56 To perform
docking with AutoDock Vina software v1.1.2, the receptor and ligand
structures were transformed to the PDBQTt file format, which included
atomic charges, atom-type definitions, and for the ligands as well
as the topological information (rotatable bonds). A grid with dimensions
of 23 ×23× 23 points was centered to the co-crystallized
ligands to ensure the coverage of the binding site of the structure.
Default parameter PatchDock server was set as clustering root mean
square deviation (RMSD) at 4.0 and docked poses were analyzed by LigPlot
Plus for generating 2D schematic representations.57,58

Preparation of Water-Soluble FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex
The β-CD:EV inclusion complex was prepared in a 2:1 M ratio.
Briefly, 10 mg of EV and 20 mg of β-CD were completely dissolved
in (1:1 v/v) mixture of ethanol and 30% ammonium hydroxide. The solution
was filtered through a 0.45 μ membrane filter, and the filtrate
was evaporated under reduced pressure and dried in a vacuum oven.59,60 The water solubility of the inclusion complex was measured by double-beam
UV–Vis spectrometer (PerkinElmer, USA). Briefly, a five-point
calibration curve of EV was prepared in ethanol and absorbance was
recorded at 267 nm, λmax (n = 6).
Furthermore, a known amount of inclusion complex powder was dissolved
in distilled water, the absorbance was recorded at 280 nm,λmax of the inclusion complex, and EV concentration was determined
(n = 6) accordingly. Furthermore, the FGF7:β-CD:EV
complex was prepared by a physical adsorption method by dissolving
6 μg FGF7 and β-CD:EV complex in ultra-pure water followed
by freeze-drying for over 24 h (at −34 °C and gradual
ascent up to 20 °C), using a Labconco freeze dryer (Labconco,
USA) to obtain the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex in a powder form.

FTIR Characterization of FGF7-β-CD-EV Complex
For
the physical mixture of FGF7, β-CD, and EV, the FGF7:β-CD:EV
inclusion complex were characterized by FTIR. All spectra were obtained
by a Thermo Fisher Scientific Nicolet iS5 spectrophotometer (Wisconsin,
USA) using OMNIC Software from 1000 to 4000 cm–1 at a data acquisition rate of 2 cm–1 per point.

Assessment of FGF7:β-CD:EV Complex Stability and EV Release
Profile in DMEM
A size-restricted dialysis tubing procedure
was employed to measure the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex stability in
a culture media and the release of EV from the complex. Briefly, complex
stability and EV release from known amounts of complex (contains 6.52
μM of EV) were determined using a modified dissolution method.
The medium comprised of a 0.05 M phosphate buffer solution (PBS) pH
7.4. The dialysis bags (MWCO 2000 Da, Sigma, Germany) were filled
with known amount of complex along with cell culture media and placed
in 50 mL PBS (pH 7.4) at 37°C with slow magnetic stirring (50
rpm) under perfect sink conditions. One mL of aliquots was withdrawn
from the external solution and replaced with the same volume of fresh
PBS. The drug concentration was detected by HPLC (Flexar FX-20, PerkinElmer,
USA) at 278 nm. All experiments were carried out in triplicate and
performed as at least three independent experiments.

Cell Culture
Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37) and FHs 74 Int (ATCC
CCL-241) cells were maintained in ATCC–formulated DMEM supplemented
with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and cells
were incubated under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and
95% air at 37 °C.

Dynamic Monitoring of Cytotoxic Activity
Using RTCA DP System
Real-time cellular analysis (RTCA) xCELLigence
technology was used
for screening of cytotoxicity by monitoring the cellular events in
real-time during the entire time course of the experiment and to obtain
more reveals about when and the rate of cellular responses.61 Caco-2 cells were seeded in E-plates 16 at a
concentration of 5 ×103, grown overnight to reach
the log phase, then treated with EV, FGF7:EV, β-CD:EV, and FGF7:β-CD:EV
complexes (each complex contained 3.26, 6.52, and 13.04 μM EV)
or medium alone, and cell responses were monitored by taking xCELLigence
RTCA DP instrument (ACEA Biosciences Inc., USA) readings every 5 min
for 24 h and every 30 min for 96 h. The kinetic profile of the cellular
responses, the decrease in cell index, and IC50 values
as per each complex were obtained accordingly against their respective
concentrations.62

Assessment of FGF7:β-CD:EV
Complex Retention in Caco-2
Cells
Two-dimensional (2D) monolayer cell culture models
are the most common method used to investigate tumor cells in vitro.63 We used a 2D monolayer cell culture system to
identify the rate of EV penetration and the extent of drug accumulation
in cancer cells. The experimental model used was the human colorectal
cancer Caco-2 cells. Drug accumulation was determined by the extracellular
concentration gradient of free EV and the relationship between exposure
time and drug accumulation was investigated.64 Briefly, cells were seeded in 6-well plate at a concentration of
5 ×104 per well and allowed to grow for 24 h. Cells
were incubated at 37°C with the FGF7:β-CD:EV complex and
EV only, each contain 6.52 μM EV, and the extracellular concentration
of the free EV was measured at different time intervals by HPLC (PerkinElmer,
USA) (for chromatographic conditions see the Supporting Information).
All experiments were carried out in triplicate and performed as at
least three independent experiments.

Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as mean
± standard deviation (SD) (n = 6), and the statistical
analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Inc.,
La Jolla, CA, USA). The significance of any differences between experimental
groups was evaluated by the one-way ANOVA followed by a Turkey–Kramer
multiple comparisons test. The calculation of IC50 values
of EV as per each complex was obtained using xCELLigence RTCA DP software.
IC50 values were expressed as the mean (M) ± S.E.M.
(n = 6). The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the
binding affinity (according to their mean and standard errors) were
estimated with 2.5 and 97.5 percentile as the lower and upper bounds.
Error bars represent the standard error of the mean.
