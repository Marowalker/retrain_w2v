A novel
halogen-free highly cross-linked supramolecular poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyl diphenol) (PZS)-functionalized melamine
cyanurate (MCA) (MCA@PZS) hybrid nanosheet fire-retardant (FR) was
synthesized and thoroughly characterized using scanning electron microscopy,
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy analyses. The polyamide 6 (PA6) composites comprising
MCA, PZS, and the MCA@PZS hybrids were prepared via the melt-blending
technique. The thermogravimetric analysis combined with FTIR and mass
spectroscopy revealed that during thermal degradation, the PA6/MCA@PZS
composites released less toxic gases and small organic volatile compounds
than the neat PA6 and composites containing MCA or PZS solely. Moreover,
compared to neat PA6, the PA6 composite with a 5 wt % MCA@PZS hybrid
exhibited enhanced fire retardation properties, with a 29.4 and 32.1%
decrease in the peak heat and total heat release rates, respectively.
Besides, the PA6 composites with MCA@PZS-5% content achieved a V-0
rating in the UL-94 test. Finally, based on the obtained results from
gaseous and condensed phases, the possible mechanism responsible for
improved FR properties of the PA6/MCA@PZS composites was proposed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Polyamide 6 (PA6), a vital
engineering polymer, has attracted considerable
attention in many fields of applications because of its excellent
mechanical properties, abrasion resistance, self-lubrication ability,
electrical properties, chemical corrosion resistance, and oil-proof
performance.1,2 However, the inherent flammability
of PA6 has restricted its applications, particularly in electrical
and electronic products. To decrease its flammability PA6 is generally
compounded with halogenated fire-retardants (FRs). However, the use
of such FRs leads to the release of dense smoke and toxic gases. Thus,
because of environmental issues, there is a strong desire to replace
halogenated FRs with halogen-free alternatives that are currently
available in the FR market. The ecological problem has led to extensive
research on ways to increase the fire safety of PA6 polymers by introducing
halogen-free FRs such as melamine derivatives,3−5 phosphorous-based
compounds,6 polyphosphazenes,7,8 and a combination of P,N-based intumescent FRs.9,10

Melamine cyanurate (MCA) is another environmentally friendly nitrogen-based
FR that contains a planar network structure with hydrogen bonds between
the melamine and cyanuric acid.11 In this
direction, Hu et al.3 prepared PA6 composites
with different MCA contents and reported that a composite comprising
15 wt % MCA is required to achieve a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test.
Thus, to increase the efficiency of the FR activity and decrease the
loading percentage, surface functionalization with other FR compounds
must be performed. Tao and Li12 functionalized
various types of bases onto the MCA surface and used the products
in the PA6 composites. They observed that PA6 composites comprising
cytosine-functionalized MCA presented better FR activity because of
their high surface area, which accelerates PA6 degradation to form
cross-linked char. Wu et al.5 synthesized
PA6/MCA composites via in situ polymerization and observed that the
composite comprising 6.8 wt % MCA exhibited excellent mechanical and
flammability properties with a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test. The uniform
dispersion of the MCA nanoparticles in the polymer matrix was responsible
for excellent fire properties.13,14 Feng et al.15 prepared PA6 composites with melamine (M)/MoS2 and MCA/MoS2 and observed that MCA/MoS2 displayed better FR activity because of the synergetic effect between
the MCA and MoS2. The melamine derivatives and MCA were
as synergetic agents for phosphorous-based FR polymers, particularly
P–N-containing FR compounds, which exhibited promising improvement.16−18

Recently, cyclotriphosphazene derivatives showed excellent
reactivity
and high P- and N-contents, which play an essential role in the development
of the thermal and flammability properties of the polymers, such as
polyurethane,19 polylactide,19,20 and unsaturated polyester.21 Mainly,
poly(cyclotriphosphazene-co-4,4′-sulfonyl
diphenol) (PZS) was employed for the surface functionalization of
various nanomaterials through covalent and noncovalent bonds. The
resulting hybrid nanomaterials provided better structural controllability
with an alternate −P=N– units and improved the
flammability, thermal conductivity, and other required properties
of the composite.22−24 For example, boron nitride sheets coated with poly(phosphazene-co-bisphenol A) were synthesized and used in epoxy resins.
The resulting composites exhibited immediate improvement in both the
thermal stability and electrical conductivity.24 However, few papers on the use of polyphosphazene nanomaterials
as FRs and their combination with other FRs to further increase the
fire retardancy of polymer materials have been reported to date.25,26

Accordingly, this paper reports the synthesis of a PZS-functionalized
MCA (MCA@PZS) hybrid using planar MCA nanosheets as a template to
achieve adequate FR activity. The resulting novel supramolecular MCA@PZS
hybrid, which was highly cross-linked because of its high P-, N- and
S-contents, was then used to prepare PA6 composites with different
MCA@PZS hybrid weight percentages, including individual MCA and PZS.
The thermal stability of PA6 and various composites were studied using
a thermogravimetric analyzer, and the toxic gas evolution behavior
of the PA6 composites was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA)–Fourier-transform infrared (TG–FTIR)–mass
spectrometry (MS) and pyrolysis gas chromatography (Py–GC)–MS.
Subsequently, the FR activity of the resulting PA6 composites was
analyzed by cone colorimetry and UL-94 testing. Moreover, time-dependence
melt-state rheology was used to understand the cross-linking behavior
of PA6 and its composites. Finally, microscopic analysis of the char
residues completed the study of the FR activity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of the Supramolecular
MCA@PZS Hybrid Nanosheets
Scheme 1 presents the synthetic procedure and formation
mechanism of the supramolecular MCA@PZS hybrid. The high polar solvent
dimethyl sulfone (DMSO) was used to synthesize the MCA nanosheets.
This solvent favored the formation of extensive H-bonding between
melamine and cyanuric acid, thereby improving the supramolecular structure
during the self-assembly process (Scheme 1). For the synthesis of the supramolecular
MCA@PZS hybrid, the MCA nanosheets acted as a hard template for the
growth of the PZS nucleus on the substrate. The synthetic procedure
followed the absorption and polymerization mechanism previously reported
for oligomeric species.27−35 Thus, the polymerization between hexachlorocyclo-triphosphazenes
(HCCPs) and 4,4′-dihydroxydiphenyl sulfone (BPS) in the presence
of triethylamine (TEA) primarily proceeded via the generation of the
PZS nucleus on the surface of the MCA nanosheets along with the release
of HCl as a by-product. This by-product was then recaptured by TEA,
thereby accelerating the polymerization reaction until the polymerization
of HCCP and BPS was completed. In the initial stage of the reaction,
the formed PZS nuclei were unstable and could easily adhere onto the
surface of the MCA nanosheets. These nuclei then aggregated with each
other, possibly via H-bonding, to form stable particles. Subsequently,
adhesion polymerization was conducted sequentially to coat the P,N-containing
highly cross-linked PZS evenly across the whole surface of the MCA
nanosheet. Scheme 1 also presents the approaching method.

Scheme 1 Schematic Model for
the Formation of Highly Cross-Linked Supramolecular
PZS-Functionalized MCA (MCA@PZS) Hybrid Nanosheets
To confirm the morphology of the successfully
synthesized products,
the structure of the supramolecular MCA@PZS hybrid together with those
of MCA and PZS were investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Figure 1). The micrographs revealed that PZS formed
as microspheres [Figure 1a,b], whereas MCA displayed a nanosheet morphology [Figure 1c,d]. The SEM and TEM images
of the MCA@PZS hybrid [Figure 1e,f] clearly illustrated that after the PZS was functionalized
onto the surface of the MCA nanosheets, the surface became relatively
smooth. Moreover, the absence of separate PZS microspheres indicated
that the MCA nanosheets were uniformly functionalized by PZS. Finally,
FTIR, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) experiments were performed to further confirm the formation
and structure of the MCA@PZS hybrid.

and TEM images of (a,b)
the synthesized PZS, (c,d) MCA, and (e,f) MCA@PZS hybrid.

The FTIR spectra of MCA, PZS, and MCA@PZS [Figure 2a] confirmed the
formation of the supramolecular
MCA@PZS hybrid through condensed polymerization from the respective
monomers. The main characteristic peaks of the MCA spectrum, at 3239
and 3367 cm–1, were assigned to the symmetric and
asymmetric absorption of the −NH– and −NH2 groups,36 respectively, those
at 1778 and 1729 cm–1 corresponded to the −C=O
group, and the peak at 1668 cm–1 was assigned to
the −C=N group. The PZS-coated MCA nanosheets showed
some additional absorption peaks: the firm absorption peaks at 1152
and 883 cm–1, assigned to the P=N and P–N
groups, respectively,37 are the main characteristic
absorption peaks of cyclotriphosphazene. The characteristic absorption
peaks at 1291 and 1152 cm–1 were assigned to the
O=S=O group of BPS, whereas the peaks at 1490 and 1588
cm–1 were assigned to the phenyl group from BPS
absorption.38 Hence, these data indicated
that PZS was successfully functionalized over the entire surface of
the MCA nanosheets.

and (d)
XPS plots of MCA, PZS, and the MCA@PZS hybrid; high-resolution C 1s
spectra of (e) MCA and (f) the MCA@PZS hybrid.

XRD analysis of all the samples [Figure 2b] was also performed to support the above
results further. The MCA XRD pattern [Figure 2b] indicated crystallinity with 2θ
peaks at the lower angle side (10.67, 18.56, and 21.45°) corresponding
to the (100), (110), and (200) planes, respectively, thereby supporting
the in-plane hexagonal structure of the channels. Additionally, the
XRD peak at 27.90° was attributed to the presence of the assembled
individual 2D nanosheets and was similar to the data observed for
graphite. The amorphous nature of PZS was responsible for the broad
peak at 2θ ≈ 15°. Figure 2b reveals that the XRD pattern of the MCA@PZS
hybrid contains a broad amorphous peak at 2θ = 15°, together
with all the characteristic peaks of the MCA nanosheets, which corresponds
to the amorphous PZS phase and demonstrates the effective functionalization
of PZS on the surface of the MCA nanosheets.

TGA evaluated the
thermal stabilities of PZS, MCA, and the MCA@PZS
hybrid under nitrogen atmosphere [Figure 2c]. The two critical temperatures necessary
to analyze the thermal properties of a substance are the onset (Tonset) and maximum (Tmax) degradation temperatures, defined as the temperatures at 5% and
maximum weight loss, respectively. MCA displayed a maximum weight
loss in the temperature range 300–400 °C because of the
formation of the cross-linked melamine derivatives melam, melem, and
melon with the elimination of NH3; this is in good agreement
with previously reported data.39Figure 2c reveals that the Tonset value of MCA is approximately 370 °C
and that the char residue at 800 °C is 1.2%.

On the other
hand, the Tonset value
of PZS is 480 °C, whereas its char residue at 800 °C is
52%. These values revealed that PZS displays superior thermal stability
over MCA. However, PZS functionalization of the MCA surface improved
the thermal stability of MCA@PZS and the hybrid exhibited a combination
of the thermal behavior of MCA and PZS [Figure 2c]. The Tonset value of the MCA@PZS hybrid was lower than that of MCA because the
presence of PZS accelerated the degradation of MCA at an early stage
and improved its char residue (32%) over that of MCA by approximately
31%. From the TGA curve of the MCA@PZS hybrid [Figure 2c], 31% PZS was functionalized on the surface
of the MCA nanosheets. XPS provided diversified information on the
surface composition and chemical states of MCA and the MCA@PZS hybrid
and thus, clear information about their chemical structure and composition.
The XPS spectra of MCA and the MCA@PZS hybrid are displayed in Figure 2d, whereas the high-resolution
images of the C 1s XPS spectra of MCA and the MCA@PZS hybrid are presented
in Figure 2e,f, respectively.
The data revealed that the surface of the MCA nanosheets is composed
of C, N, and O. The data in Figure 2d also showed that along with these three elements,
the XPS spectra of the MCA@PZS hybrid also contained P and S peaks
obtained from PZS. Also, in the case of the MCA@PZS hybrid, the intensities
of C 1s and O 1s were increased, whereas the intensity of the N 1s
peak was decreased when compared to those of MCA. This changes in
relevant peak intensities and elemental composition confirmed that
the PZS functionalized onto the surface of the MCA nanosheets.40 The high-resolution C 1s spectrum of MCA [Figure 2e] confirms the presence
of C–C (284.6 eV), C–N (286.0 eV), C=N (288.1
eV), and C=O (289.6 eV) groups. After PZS functionalization
on the MCA surface, the C 1s spectrum of the MCA@PZS hybrid [Figure 2f] showed two additional
peaks, assigned to the C–O–P (286.5 eV) and C–S
(287.3 eV) groups, which correspond to the PZS peaks.41,42 These data also clearly indicated that the PZS functionalized onto
the surface of the MCA nanosheets.

2.2 Thermal
Stability of PA6 and Its Composites
TGA evaluated the thermal
stability of neat PA6 and its composites
under nitrogen and air atmospheres. Figure 3 presents the TGA results, and Table 1 summarizes the relevant data
calculated from TGA thermograms. In both atmospheric conditions, all
samples follow similar decomposition paths except early stage degradation.
In a nitrogen environment [Figure 3a], all the samples displayed typical single-stage
degradation in the temperature range of 380–515 °C, corresponding
to the degradation of neat PA6. On the other hand, in air atmosphere
[Figure 3c], all the
TGA plots displayed typical second-stage degradation (typical temperature
range: 480–540 °C), which might be linked with the oxidation
and aromatization of aliphatic carbons followed by the release of
CO and CO2 gases. In an air atmosphere, the first stage
degradation is more significant because of the oxidative degradation
of unstable char. The temperature at 5 wt % weight loss (Tonset), 80 wt % weight loss (Tmax), and the residual char percentages at 800 °C are also listed
in Table 1, to compare
the thermal degradation behavior of neat PA6 and various PA6 composites.
The Tonset and Tmax for PA6 are 411.06 and 465.53 °C, respectively. In
the case of composites in both atmospheres, compared to neat PA6,
the initial stability of all composites decreased, which is a common
observation for FR-containing polymer composites because FR accelerates
the polymer matrix degradation in an early stage to improve the residual
char formation.13 The Tonset for PA6/MCA-3% and PA6/PZS-3% composites are 372.95
and 365.62 °C, respectively. On the other hand, in the case of
PA6/MCA@PZS composites, the early stage thermal stability decreased,
and this trend becomes stronger with increasing MCA@PZS hybrid nanosheets’
loading in the composite; for example, for PA6/MCA@PZS-5%, the Tonset is 337.44 °C. For the derivate plots
[Figure 3b,d] shows
that the maximum weight loss rate is higher in PA6 composites than
in the neat PA6 and this is more prominent in the air atmosphere.
In the case of PA6/MCA@PZS composites with increasing MCA@PZS loading
in the PA6 matrix, the peak intensity decreased. Such an observation
supports that the MCA@PZS hybrid promotes PA6 matrix degradation in
the early stage to quickly form a thermally insulating char, which
provides strong protection to the underlying material again further
degradation at the high-temperature range. Furthermore, in the case
of PA6/MCA@PZS composites, the data calculated from TGA thermograms
(Table 1) show that
the residual char yield at 800 °C is higher in the nitrogen atmosphere
than in air, and this yield also increases with the increased loading
of MCA@PZS in the composites.

2.3 Volatile Gaseous Products
of PA6 and Various
PA6 Composites Analyzed by TG–FTIR–MS
When
a polymer material is associated with FR activity, it is important
to analyze the emitted volatile components during thermal degradation.
The TG–FTIR is an important technique which was used to evaluate
the effect of the FR compounds (MCA and PZS) and the MCA@PZS hybrid
on the released gas components of PA6 during thermal degradation. Figure 4 presents the resulting
FTIR spectra of the neat PA6 and its composites with different FR
contents at the maximum decomposition stage. The spectra indicated
that except for the small difference in the intensities of the released
pyrolytic components and toxic gases, the thermal degradation behavior
of PA6 and its composites with FR are near identical. On the basis
of the FTIR absorption bands, some of the released pyrolytic components
were identified as hydrocarbons (2960 cm–1), aromatic
compounds (1640 cm–1), carbonyl compounds (1730
cm–1), CO (2138 cm–1), CO2 (2346 cm–1), and NH3 (968 cm–1).43Figure 5 reports the Gram–Schmidt plots (a)
and plots of the released volatile components [(b) CO, (c) CO2, and (d) NH3] versus time. These plots revealed
that the absorbance intensity of the released volatile components
was relatively lower in the presence of an FR. Moreover, the absorbance
intensity of the MCA@PZS hybrid was significantly less than those
of MCA and PZS. The significantly decreased absorbance intensity was
attributed to the MCA@PZS hybrid nanosheets, which promote char formation
and strengthen the char structure because of the formation of highly
cross-linked components, thereby decreasing the thermal decomposition
and gas diffusion rates. The maximum absorbance intensities of the
released volatile components declined to approximately 60% of the
intensities of the volatile components released by pure PA6, which
indicated that the amount of volatiles released from the PA6/MCA@PZS-5%
composite was much lower than that released from pure PA6. Volatile
organic compounds generate smoke upon condensation. Hence, a decrease
in the amount of released volatiles would result in a decrease in
fire toxicity and smoke.

CO2, and (d) NH3.

To evaluate the pyrolysis mechanism of various samples, the
Py–GC–MS
spectra of PA6, PA6/MCA-3%, and PA6/MCA@PZS-5% were recorded, and
the results are reported in Figure 6. Figure 7 indicates the proposed possible pyrolysis mechanisms.44−46 The pyrolysis temperature was considered as the temperature at which
the samples were completely decomposed. Generally, the thermal degradation
of PA6 leads to many different products with caprolactam (m/z = 113) as the main degradation product.47,48 The apparent fragment peaks at m/z = 94 and 93 correspond to the phenol and phenoxyl groups, respectively.
Subsequently, the phenol decomposed and new fragmented peaks at m/z (m, mass; z, charge number of ions) = 80, 79, 66, 53, and 40 were
observed. Similarly, the released few pyrolysis components were identified
based on their m/z values, and Table 2 presents their chemical
structures. The degradation process that occurred in the presence
of MCA and the MCA@PZS hybrid was utterly different to that observed
for the neat PA6.

composite at the maximum degradation stage.

Figure 7 Proposed possible thermal degradation mechanism of the PA6/MCA@PZS
composite during combustion. At the high-temperature range, the MCA
and PZS interact with PA6 degraded components in different paths with
the release of nonflammable gases and various nitrogen-based small
volatile components. The PZS part mainly involves during dehydration
of polymer chains to form an insulating char through the formation
of phosphoric acids, pyro-phosphoric acids, etc. The MCA exhibits
the flame-retardant action through endothermic degradation and release
of nonflammable gases through the creation of condensed compounds
of melamine-derivatives.

Moreover, the PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composite
presented a significant
decrease in the peak intensities and eluted total small volatile organic
compounds over those seen for the PA6/MCA-3% composite (Figure 6). These results clearly indicate
that the presence of the MCA@PZS hybrid improved the FR activity of
PA6 because of the formation of highly cross-linked products during
thermal degradation (Figure 7) and significantly decreased the release of small volatile
organic compounds compared to those released by neat PA6. The data
in Table 2 clearly
illustrate that the released volatiles comprise benzene and its derivatives,
heteroatom-containing cyclic compounds, and various other small volatile
oligomeric organic compounds that are responsible for causing secondary
injury. Moreover, all these compounds form dense smoke upon condensation,
which can reduce visibility and increase the difficulty of fire rescue.49 Notably, the pyrolysis compounds released from
the PA6/MCA@PZS composites during thermal degradation did not include
phosphorous-containing compounds, indicating that cyclotriphosphazenes
are entirely involved in the cross-linked char residue formation.50 Hence, PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composites exhibited high
FR activity over the individual MCA and PZS.

To understand the
degradation and cross-linking characteristics,
the melt-state rheological experiments of neat PA6 and various composites
were carried out at 200 °C in air atmosphere.49Figure 8 reports the time-dependence storage modulus (G′),
loss modulus (G″), and complex viscosity (η*)
of various samples. The results clearly show that the presence of
the MCA@PZS hybrid improved the rheological properties (G′, G″, and η*) of PA6/MCA@PZS
composites over time as compared to individual MCA- or PZS-containing
composites. Moreover, increasing the MCA@PZS loading in the composite
further improves the rheological properties. Because of its combined
effect of MCA and PZS and it involved in different directions with
releasing of nonflammable gases and formed crosslinked compounds50,51 during combustion as shown in Figure 7. Hence, the composite containing MCA@PZS hybrid forms
cross-linked P–N-containing char during combustion, which provides
strong barrier properties to inhibit the evolution of heat and toxic
gases.

2.4 Fire Properties and Analysis of the Char Residue
of PA6 and Its Composites
The fire performance of PA6 and
its composites with various FR contents (MCA, PZS, and MCA@PZS hybrid)
was next analyzed by cone colorimetry. The heat release rate (HRR),
total heat release (THR), CO production (COP), and CO2 production
(CO2P) versus time curves are displayed in Figure 9, whereas some of the essential
parameter values [PHRR, THR, COP, CO2P, and
maximum average heat rate emission (MAHRE)] obtained from the flammability
test are listed in Table 3. During polymer combustion, the fire intensity and spread
rate mainly depend on the released HRR and thus, the most effective
FR system always displays the lowest HRR values.13,14 Notably, the pure PA6 burned rapidly, with HRR and THR values of
453.4 kW/m2 and 119.9 MJ/m2, respectively. When
3 wt % MCA was incorporated into the PA6 matrix, the HRR value slightly
increased to 471.5 kW/m2, whereas the THR value was reduced
to 99.1 MJ/m2. The higher HRR peak value may be due to
the formation of fractured (loosely bonded or un-cross-linked) char
formation during the early stage of combustion.

of PA6 and its composites with different
FRs indicated in the figure: (a) HRR, (b) THR rate, (c) CO2P, and (d) COP vs time.

On the other hand,
the introduction of 3 wt % PZS into PA6 decreased
both the HRR and THR values (397.8 kW/m2 and 92.3 MJ/m2, respectively). However, the data in Figure 9 and Table 3 reveal that the most significant decreases were observed
for the PA6 composites comprising the MCA@PZS hybrid, with the PA6/MCA@PZS-5%
composite exhibiting the lowest HRR and THR values (320.1 kW/m2 and 80.2 MJ/m2, respectively). This occurred because
in the presence of a hybrid FR, the polymer degrades faster and forms
a thermal insulating char with extensive P–N cross-linkage
that protects the material from further substrate degradation at higher
temperatures. CO is a very significant toxic gas that must be considered
because when it combines with other toxic gases such as HCN it becomes
highly toxic. Hence, the COP is also an essential factor to evaluate
the fire safety of polymers. It is also well known that cone colorimetry
is based on the oxygen consumption principle so that the HRR of the
burning polymer material is equivalent to oxygen consumption. Polymer
combustion instantaneously releases heat radiation and some of the
oxidized gases, including CO2. Therefore, the CO2P plots versus time exhibit similar trends to those observed in the
HRR plots [Figure 9c]. The CO2P and COP peaks for neat PA6 were determined
as 340 and 1.9 mg/s, respectively [Figure 9c,d]. After adding 3 wt % MCA and PZS to
PA6, a slight decrease in both values was observed.

On the other
hand, the CO2P and COP values for the PA6
composites comprising the MCA@PZS hybrid were significantly lower
and the PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composite produced CO2P and COP
values of 240 and 1.45 mg/s, respectively. This was attributed to
two main reasons: (i) the combined effect of MCA and PZS and (ii)
the formation of a more compact dense char during combustion, which
decreases the evolution of the small organic volatiles responsible
for CO and CO2P during further thermal oxidation. Table 3 illustrates that
the MAHRE values of the composites comprising the MCA@PZS hybrid are
significantly lower than those of the pure PA6; moreover, an increase
in the MCA@PZS hybrid content of the PA6 composites further reduced
the MAHRE values.

The complete analysis of the FR activity should
include the char
structure. Thus, the residual chars from the cone colorimetry tests
were collected and their relevant microstructure morphologies investigated
(Figure 10). When
the neat PA6 polymer was burned vigorously (fire test), breaking char
residues were observed [Figure 10a]. When 3 wt % MCA was added to PA6, the resulting
composite burning improved the char residue [Figure 10c]. However, the residual char skeleton
contained many cracks and voids caused by the release of nonflammable
gases from MCA degradation during combustion. The composite with the
MCA@PZS hybrid formed continuous and high compact intumescent char
[Figure 10e], indicating
the combination effect of the MCA@PZS hybrid, whereby PZS facilitated
the carbonization of the PA6 polymer chains, whereas MCA released
the nonflammable gases. Figure 10b,d,f illustrates the microstructural SEM images of
the external char residues from pure PA6 and the PA6/MCA-3% and PA6/MCA@PZS-5%
composites.

the cone
colorimetry test and FE-SEM images of the char residues: (a,b) PA6,
(c,d) PA6/MCA-3%, and (e,f) PA6/MCA@PZS-5%.

For the neat PA6, the observed fragile and thin char pieces
[Figure 10b] were
due to
the inferior quality of the char. Hence, in this case, strong char
could not form on the surface of the substrate to prevent further
degradation at the high-temperature conditions during combustion.
As a result, the neat polymer burnt vigorously with strong melt drippings. Figure 10d shows the structural
morphology of the residual char from PA6/MCA-3%. The image shows small
bubbles on the surface and a broken char layer, which occurred because
the char layers could not expand during combustion to inhibit the
evolution of the volatile components. On the other hand, the char
from the PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composite displayed a highly compact dense
morphology [Figure 10f], attributed to the higher N- and P-contents in the MCA@PZS hybrid.
Thus, during combustion, MCA and PZS interacted with the degraded
PA6 components in different ways to form dense char containing extensive
P–N cross-linkage. This form of char inhibits both mass and
heat transfer as well as the release of volatile components (TG–FTIR
and Py–GC–MS analysis sections). A more compact dense
char layer with a microporous structure was also observed on the surface
of the material. This type of char better blocks the gas and heat
exchange between the fire zone area and the polymer material. Figure 10f illustrates the
presence of bubbles on the surface of the char because of the inhibition
of the release of the degraded volatile components and toxic gases.
These results indicate that the MCA@PZS hybrid improved the fire safety
of the polymer materials.

2.5 Flammability Rating—UL-94
Test
The FR activities of PA6 and its composites with different
FRs were
evaluated by the UL-94 test and the results are also summarized in Table 3. The pure PA6 was
highly flammable with strong melt drippings (Figure 11) and did not achieve a UL-94 rating. With
the introduction of MCA into the PA6 matrix, a V-2 rating in the UL-94
test was attained.12 The PA6 composite
containing 3 wt % PZS decreased the burning time over that of neat
PA6 and achieved a V-2 rating in the UL-94 test (Table 3).49 On the other hand, the PA6 composites comprising the MCA@PZS hybrid
brought significant changes in the flammability and the PA6/MCA@PZS-5%
composite exhibited a UL-94 V-0 rating. Overall, the MCA@PZS hybrid
afforded a more substantial increase in the FR activity of the PA6
composites compared to those of the individual MCA and PZS. This may
be due to the presence of higher P- and N-contents in the MCA@PZS
hybrid as well as the combined effect of MCA and PZS, which maximize
the possible strong interactions between the PA6 matrix and the MCA@PZS
hybrid in the PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composite.

test: (a) PA6, (b) PA6/MCA-3%, (c) PA6/PZS-3%, (d) PA6/MCA@PZS-3%,
and (e) PA6/MCA@PZS-5%. The digital pictures reported in this figure
were taken by K.M. who is the first author of this work.

On the basis of the above discussion of condensed-phase
and gas-phase
FR activities, the suitable FR mechanism of the PA6/MCA@PZS composite
is schematically proposed in Figure 12. The MCA is functionalized with PZS to improve the
FR properties of MCA nanosheets when they are dispersed in the PA6
matrix. During combustion, the volatile flammable gases, such as hydrocarbons,
aromatic components, and other various small organic components escaped
from the volatile PA6 composite to the flame zone as shown in Figure 12, which supports
continuous combustion with the release of heat. However, the MCA@PZS
hybrid containing composite exhibited a more efficient FR activity
than the composites containing MCA or PZS solely. This is because
of two reasons: first, the gas-phase flame-retardant activity of MCA
improves the degradation process of MCA@PZS during combustion. The
N element of MCA releases nonflammable gases and dilutes the oxygen
concentration and it also absorbs  the heat with endothermic
degradation and cools the flame zone area. Second, the condensed phase
flame-retardant effect of PZS on the surface of MCA, which increases
the carbonaceous of polymer chains to form the thermally insulating
char and thereby high compact and rigid protective layer is formed.
This layer prevents the heat and mass transfer, and the escape of
pyrolytic components in between the PA6 matrix and flame zone area
results in decreasing both toxic smoke formation and heat release.
Moreover, the increased loading of the MCA@PZS hybrid in the composite
significantly improves the rheological property, which further supports
the formation of polyaromatic P–N-containing high cross-linked
components in the condensed phase and provides strong barrier properties.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the novel halogen-free supramolecular MCA@PZS hybrid
was synthesized via a condensation polymerization method with MCA
nanosheets as the template. This hybrid structure comprised high P-
and N-contents with extensive cross-linkage, which improved the FR
activity of the PA6 composites. Further, PA6 composites comprising
the hybrid FR MCA@PZS and individual FR MCA and PZS were also prepared
and their flammability properties compared. The cone colorimetry test
results revealed that the MCA@PZS hybrid containing composite improved
the FR activity of the PA6 polymer, with lower HRR, THR, COP, and
CO2P values and toxic gas evolution during combustion over
those afforded by individual MCA and PZS. The TG–FTIR and Py–GC–MS
data revealed that the PA6/MCA@PZS-5% composites strongly inhibited
the release of small organic volatile compounds, COP, and other toxicants,
thereby implying a decrease in the smoke toxicity. Moreover, during
thermal degradation, the combined effect of MCA and PZS allowed these
composites to interact with the PA6 degraded components in different
directions to form highly cross-linked dense char. This type of char
can prevent heat and toxicant evolution and hence decreases the fire
toxicity. The PA6 composites comprising the MCA@PZS hybrid achieved
a V-0 rating in the UL-94 test, with a decrease in burning time and
no melt drippings. Overall, this work illustrates that the synthesized
MCA@PZS hybrid shows excellent potential as an FR additive in PA6
polymers to further extend the applications of this polymer.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
PA6
(1034B) was supplied
by Ube Industries Ltd., Tokyo, Japan. HCCP, BPS, TEA, acetonitrile
98%, DMSO, melamine, and cyanuric acid were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Johannesburg, South Africa, and used as received without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis of MCA
MCA was synthesized
according to a previously reported procedure,36 with modification. Thus, equimolar ratios of melamine (1 g) and
cyanuric acid (1.02 g) were dissolved separately in 40 and 20 mL DMSO,
respectively, and then mixed together. The resultant white suspension,
which formed immediately after mixing, was stirred continuously at
70 °C for 24 h. The afforded MCA was then centrifuged, washed
twofold with distilled water and ethanol, and finally dried in a vacuum
oven at 80 °C for 24 h.

4.3 Synthesis of PZS
HCCP (1.8 g, 5.18
mmol) and BPS (4.8 g, 19.2 mmol) were dissolved separately in 150
mL acetonitrile, mixed, and subsequently sonicated for 30 min at 25
°C. TEA (4.32 g, 42 mmol) was then added to the reaction mixture
to immediately form a milky white suspension. The suspension was then
sonicated at 50 °C for a further 4 h. The resultant white suspension
was centrifuged, washed twofold with distilled water and ethanol,
and finally dried at 80 °C in a vacuum oven for 24 h.

4.4 Functionalization of the MCA@PZS Hybrid
The supramolecular
halogen-free FR MCA@PZS was synthesized by PZS
functionalization on the surface of planar MCA nanosheets via the
sol–gel method. First, 2 g of synthesized MCA nanosheets were
dispersed in 100 mL of acetonitrile and stirred for 30 min. Exactly
0.5 g of HCCP was then added and after complete dissolution, the mixture
was stirred for a further 30 min; 4 mL of TEA was then added under
continuous stirring. Next, the calculated weight of BPS dissolved
in acetonitrile was added slowly to the reaction mixture, under stirring,
across a period of 30 min and the mixture was stirred for a further
1 h. The resulting reaction mixture was further sonicated for 4 h
to obtain a white suspension, which was washed twofold with distilled
water and ethanol, and dried in a vacuum oven (80 °C for 24 h).

4.5 Preparation of the PA6 Composites
The PA6
composites were prepared by a melt blending method using
different weight percentages of the MCA@PZS hybrid as well as individual
MCA and PZS. Prior to extrusion, all the samples were dried in an
oven at 80 °C for 24 h. A twin-screw extruder (process 11, co-rotating
twin-screw extruder, L/D = 40, Thermo
Scientific, USA) was employed and the extruded samples were collected
via a water bath and subsequently pelletized. Different temperatures
were maintained (128, 240, 250, 260, 260, 260, and 260 °C) at
different zones during processing, whereas the dye temperature was
250 °C. The screw speed was maintained at 200 rpm, and the obtained
samples in the extruder were further melt-blended and compression
molded at 240 °C. All the samples were first melted at 240 °C
for 5 min and a pressure of 1 Mton was then applied for 1 min. Next,
the molded samples were cooled down to 24 °C using tap water,
and the pressure was then released. The afforded samples were used
for further characterization.

4.6 Characterization
and Property Measurements
The XRD patterns of all the synthesized
powder samples (MCA, PZS,
and MCA@PZS) were collected from the X-ray generator using a PANalytical
X’pert PRO diffractometer (The Netherlands) and Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 0.154 nm; current = 30 mA and voltage = 40 kV).
The diffractograms were collected at a scan rate of 0.6/min at the
2θ range 2–80°. TGA (model TGA Q800, TA Instruments,
USA) was performed in the temperature range 30–800 °C
at a heating rate of 20 °C/min under a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere.
The microstructures of the char residues were elucidated by SEM (AURIGA
Crossbeam Workstation, Carl Zeiss, Germany) at 3 kV. To evaluate the
degradable volatile components of PA6 and its composites with different
FR contents, TGA–FTIR–MS and Py–GC–MS
were carried out using a PerkinElmer (USA) Pyris 1 TGA thermogravimetric
analyzer connected to a Nicolet IS50 spectrometer in the temperature
range 50–800 °C, at a heating rate of 20 °C/min,
under nitrogen. The tested PA6 composite samples weighed approximately
20 mg. XPS measurements of MCA and the MCA@PZS hybrid were conducted
using a Kratos Axis Ultra device (Kratos, UK) with monochromatic (Al
Kα) excitation source. The flammability properties of PA6 and
its composites with different FR contents were studied by cone colorimetry
(Fire Testing Technology, East Grinstead, UK) according to ISO 5660.
The prepared test specimen samples (dimensions = 100 × 100 ×
3 mm3) were wrapped in aluminum foil with the top surface
open and exposed to the radiant cone at a heat flux of 25 kW/m2. The vertical burning test was carried out using an FTT (Fire
Testing Technology), model UL-94, Fire Testing Technology Limited,
U.K., according to the ASTM D5207 and the test specimen of 125 ×
13 × 3.2 mm3 were prepared by the melt-compression
method.
