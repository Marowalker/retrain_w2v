Multi-phase nanostructured polymer
electrolytes, where the one
phase conducts ions while the other imparts the desired mechanical
properties, are currently the most promising candidates for solid-state
electrolytes in high-density lithium metal batteries. In contrast
to homogeneous polymer electrolytes, where ion transport is coupled
with polymer segmental dynamics and any attempt to improve conductivity
via faster polymer motions results in a decrease in stiffness, nanostructured
materials efficiently decouple these two antagonistic parameters.
Nevertheless, for reasons discussed herein the synthesis of a polymer
electrolyte that simultaneously has a shear modulus of G′ ≈ GPa and an ion conductivity of σ > 10–4 S/cm (in the case dual ion conductor) or of σ
> 10–5 S/cm (in the case of single-ion conductor)
remains a challenge. This review focuses on recent designing strategies
for the synthesis of all-polymer nanostructured electrolytes, and
protocols for introducing a single-ion character in such materials.

1 Introduction
Climate change, pollution,
and declining fossil resources are overwhelming
challenges to humankind. Gaseous emissions from burning fossil fuels
and biomass are not only polluting the air over large modern cities
but are also creating alarming climate changes. Furthermore, it is
universally recognized that national vulnerabilities and social instabilities
can be created by a foreign dependence on fossil fuels. These concerns
lead to national initiatives to reconsider the use of alternative
energy sources such as solar radiation, wind, and waves. However,
the intermittence of these resources, since they are variable in time
and diffuse in space, requires high-efficiency energy storage systems.
If a future economy based on renewable energy sources is to become
reality, we will need to develop compact, safe, lightweight, high-capacity
rechargeable batteries with longer life/cycles.1,2 At
present, the definitive route to increase the energy density of the
currently used, commercial available, Li ion battery (LIB) is the
incorporation of metallic lithium as the anode material.3,4 For a given cathode material, metallic lithium maximizes the cell
voltage and has a specific anode capacity nearly ten times larger
than the currently used lithium-intercalating graphite anodes and
gives the maximum possible energy density of any anode material. Lithium
metal is the lightest (atomic mass of 7 g mol–1),
one of the most reducing of metals (electrochemical potential of
−3.04 V, measured against the standard hydrogen electrode)
and therefore holds the highest possible energy density for a negative
electrode.

Today, LIBs represent a multibillion-dollar industry
as the power
supply of cellular phones, tablets, laptops, and other hand-held electronic
devices. The currently used LIBs are composed of a liquid electrolyte,
which is a mixture of a lithium salt dissolved in an organic solvent,
sandwiched between two lithium-intercalating electrodes. Despite their
high ionic conductivity, liquid electrolytes are incompatible with
lithium metal with many safety issues. Presently the most difficult
challenge to the development of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) stems
from the uneven dendritic lithium electrodeposition on the negative
electrode.3,4 Once nucleated, the growing dendrites have
at least two harmful consequences on battery operation. First, the
high surface area structures continuously react with the electrolyte
solvent to form solid electrolyte interface, consuming the electrolyte
and eventually causing premature battery failure. Second, dendrites
eventually short circuit the battery cell, as they create an electron-conductive
connection between the two electrodes. When a flammable electrolyte
is used, the dendrite-induced short is both a potential fire and explosion
hazard, leading to catastrophic battery failure.5

After the theoretical prediction by Monroe and Newman6 that a mechanically robust electrolyte with a
shear modulus, G′, of order of GPa would
mechanically suppress/block macroscopic dendrite formation and growth,
significant research efforts have focused on the development of solid-state
electrolytes, capable of eliminating dendrite formation while exhibiting
high ionic conductivity at room temperature. Solid-state electrolytes
fall mainly into two categories: inorganic ceramic electrolytes and
solid polymer electrolytes. Despite the fact that inorganic ceramics
exhibit satisfactory ionic conductivity and mechanical properties
that range from tens to hundreds of GPa, the lack of good adhesion
to Li electrodes (high-modulus materials often do not afford good
adhesion) significantly increases interfacial resistance during cycling.7 Moreover, the electrochemical stability window
of ceramic electrolytes is very narrow.8

The use of solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs)
represents
the ultimate solution due to the chemical stability of these materials
toward Li metal electrodes and their mechanical resistance to dendrite
growth. SPEs have a much better adhesion with electrodes than ceramics,
which, along with their good flexibility and scalable fabrication,
makes them favorable for battery manufacturing. The first observation
of ionic conductivity in complexes of lithium salts within linear
poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) appeared in 1973 in Polymer, while its application in a battery cell was validated several years
later.9 Since then, PEO has been the subject
of extensive studies owing to its ability to solvate a wide variety
of lithium salts; the ethylene oxide (EO) units have a strong affinity
for Li+, while their high chain flexibility and low glass
transition temperature promotes
fast ion transport (Figure 1a). It is widely accepted that ion conduction occurs in the
amorphous PEO phase and that ion diffusion is coupled with the PEO
dynamics (Figure 1a,
top).10 At temperatures below the crystalline
melting temperature of PEO (Tm ≈
60 °C, for PEO molecular weight Mw > 1 kg/mol), the electrolyte is solid with G′
≈ 0.1 GPa (i.e., close to the required, Figure 1b), but ion conductivity at room temperature
is σ ≈ 10–6−10–8 S/cm, i.e., several orders of magnitude lower than what is required
for practical applications (Figure 1c). At temperatures T > Tm, the volume fraction of the amorphous, conductive
PEO
phase increases, Li+ may transport throughout the whole
material (Figure 1a,
bottom), and the ionic conductivity can be as high as 10–3 S/cm (Figure 1c);
nevertheless, the melting of PEO crystals results in a modulus of
1–10 MPa (Figure 1b) and does not meet the criterion for reduced dendrite formation.
Unfortunately, in homogeneous polymer materials, any attempt to improve
conductivity via faster polymer motions results in a decrease in stiffness.

segmental dynamics (dark blue squares, right axis), and salt concentration
(light blue triangles, right axes) vs salt molar ration (Reprinted
from the work of Hallinan et al.10 Copyright
2013. Annual Review).

At low molecular weights,
with unentangled linear PEO homopolymer
electrolytes, ion diffusion occurs via the diffusion of the entire
PEO chain with the coordinated ion. With increasing PEO molecular
weight, entanglements start to occur between polymer chains; ion diffusion
is primarily mediated by segmental dynamics and Li+ hopping
between adjacent ether oxygen atoms with the processes of breaking/forming
lithium–oxygen (Li–O) bonds (fluctuation driven diffusion).
Both mechanisms should occur in polymer systems with the relative
importance to depend on the molecular weight. As a result, at molecular
weight higher than 1–2 kg/mol, the ionic conductivity is independent
of the PEO chain length (Figure 1d). It is important to point out that ion conductivity
depends strongly on the lithium salt concentration and has a nonmonotonic
behavior with lithium salt weight fraction (orange data, left axis
in Figure 1e). This
is the result of two competing factors: on one hand, ionic conductivity
increases with lithium salt weight fraction as the free ion concentration
increases (light blue triangles, right axes in Figure 1e), and on the other hand, due to the polymer–ion
interactions, polymer dynamics decrease monotonically with increasing
salt concentration (dark blue squares, right axes in Figure 1e); that tends to decrease
ion conductivity (Figure 1e).

In homogeneous polymer materials, like pure PEO-based
electrolytes,
ion motion/transport is coupled with segmental dynamics, and any attempt
to improve conductivity via faster polymer motions and/or melting
of crystals results in a decrease in stiffness.10 The “state-of-the-art” approach
to decouple these two antagonistic parameters is the generation of multi-phase nanostructured polymer electrolytes, where one
phase conducts ions (that needs to be soft/mobile phase needed for
fast ion motion), while the insulating glassy phase imparts the desired
mechanical properties.12,13 It is important to point out
that the addition of inorganic particles (hybrid polymer nanocomposite
electrolytes) offers a facile route to imparting needed materials
characteristics and has attracted considerable interest for the synthesis
of high-performance solid polymer electrolytes.14,15 However, despite the developments reported across a rich breadth
of polymer electrolytes systems, the best performing electrolytes
with G′ ∼ GPa still have at least two orders of magnitude
lower ionic conductivities than what is required when their mechanical
properties are achieved.

2 Block Copolymer Electrolytes
A cost-effective, robust, and scalable way to generate complex
multidomain morphologies involves the self-assembly of block copolymers
(BCPs). The most basic version of a copolymer is a linear diblock
copolymer in which two chemically distinct chains, or blocks, are
linked end-to-end. The classic battle between entropy and enthalpy,
coupled with the geometric constraints on phase separation, cause
these materials to self-assemble into nanostructured morphologies
with length scales on the order of 5–100 nm controlled by their
molecular characteristics.16 These morphologies
include spheres arranged on a body-centered-cubic lattice, hexagonally
packed cylinders, bicontinuous gyroid networks, and stacked lamellae
depending on the composition of the block copolymer. At high enough
temperatures, entropy dominates, causing the two blocks to homogeneously
mix in a disordered phase; the nature of concentration fluctuations
in the disordered phase has been studied in considerable detail.16 The self-assembly behavior and resultant structure
is controlled by the volume fraction of one component f and the degree of segregation χN; χ
is the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter, which parametrizes
the thermodynamic compatibility between the two blocks, and N is the overall degree of polymerization. By tuning these
parameters appropriately, it is possible to obtain nanostructured
materials that combine the properties of the constituent blocks. This
has led researchers to use block copolymers as solid membranes for
selective transport of various species, typically with one transporting
block and one structural block.

Microsegregated PEO-based copolymer
electrolytes are currently
the most commonly studied nanostructured materials in all-polymer
nanostructured solid electrolytes. The earlier work on triblock copolymer
electrolytes was reported by Giles group in 1987. The triblock copolymer
was based on a styrene–butadiene-styrene ABA triblock copolymer
having pendant, short PEO chains grafted onto the B block. The PEO
volume fraction in the polymer was controlled by varying either the
number of pendant groups or their molecular weight. In the absence
of any morphological and mechanical analysis, an ion conductivity
of σ ≈ 10–6 S/cm was reported at room
temperature. In 1999, Mayes et al. proposed the use of comb diblock
copolymer, where the conducting block was composed of a poly(methacrylate)
backbone grafted with short PEO side chains (POEM). The idea was that
low-molecular weight PEO chains, grafted to synthetic backbone, would
have both fast dynamics and suppressed crystallization, favoring high
ionic conductivity.19 By synthesizing a
variety of different POEM-based diblock copolymers, where the second
block was either poly(lauryl methacrylate) (PLMA, Tg ≈ −35 °C), poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA, Tg ≈
−40 °C), or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA, Tg ≈ −100 °C), they showed that the
highest conductivity is obtained when the POEM block is attached to
the soft, rubbery PLMA block, rather than to a glassy PMMA block.
SPEs with σ ≈ 5 × 10–5 S/cm and G′ ≈ 0.5 MPa were reported for the POEM-b-PLMA block copolymer. On the basis of the same POEM conducting
block, Niitani et al. showed that the ionic conductivity and mechanical
strength vary in opposite way in polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene
glycol methacrylate)-b-polystyrene (PS-b-POEM-b-PS) comb triblock copolymers and depend
on the PEO weight fraction.20 At 30 °C,
when the PEO content exceeded 80%, an ionic conductivity of ∼10–4 S/cm was reported but with a very poor mechanical
strength as the soft, liquid-like, low molecular weight (Mw) PEO grafted chains dominated the average mechanical
response of the polymer electrolyte.

Balsara’s group21 has extensively
studied the linear PS–PEO diblock copolymer-based electrolytes.
Unexpectedly for what it was known for PEO-based electrolytes, in
PS-b-PEO electrolytes doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
imide (LiTFSI) the ion conductivity was shown to increase with the
molecular weight of the PEO block; something that was recently verified
and predicted also theoretically.22 Balsara’s
group explained this behavior in terms of the existence of a “dead
zone” for ion transport next to PS/PEO interface (Figure 2c).17 As the molecular weight of the PEO block increases, the
volume fraction of the “dead zone” decreases, and ion-conductivity
increases. A PS/PEO molar ratio around unity (i.e., in lamellar forming
electrolytes) provides the best balance between mechanical strength
and ionic conductivity (Figure 2a,b). At temperatures below the glass transition temperature
of the PS, that is, for T < 100 °C, G′ ≈ GPa (Figure 2b). Despite the good mechanical properties
of PS-b-PEO/LiTFSI electrolytes for a wide range
of temperatures, the ion conductivity at room temperature was ∼10–7 S/cm (Figure 2a), that is, 3 orders of magnitude lower than what is required
for any practical application. Only at temperatures higher than ∼80
°C, that is, at temperatures above the melting of the PEO crystals,
σ(T) ≈ 10–4 S/cm in
the best-performing linear BCP/Li salt electrolyte.

Park et al. showed that Li+ transport in PEO/PS copolymers
may be improved by employing a mikto-arm star architecture composed
of three PEO arms connected to one PS chain, that is, PS(PEO)3.18 A simultaneous enhancement
in both the ionic conductivity and mechanical strength was reported
in PS(PEO)3 when compared to their PS-b-PEO analogues (Figure 2d). Because of the star-shaped architecture of PS(PEO)3 and associated geometrical constrains, PEO crystallization was significantly
reduced giving rise to room-temperature conductivities an order of
magnitude higher compared to the corresponding PS-b-PEO. Geometrical constraints imposed by the star-shaped macromolecular
architecture of PS(PEO)3 showed the reduction of the segregation
strength of PS and PEO block giving rise to a notably smaller domain
spacing for PS(PEO)3 compared to the linear analogues.

3 Nanostructuring All-Polymer Electrolytes—Beyond
Block Copolymers
To further articulate the need for nanostructured
solid polymer
electrolytes with designing rules beyond the use of microsegregated
block copolymers, a short overview of the factors that affect the
ion conductivity in block copolymer materials and limit their realization
in solid polymer electrolytes is provided below.

Research in
the field has revealed that one of the main drawbacks
for the realization of block copolymer electrolytes is the formation
of grains across the thickness of an electrolyte’s membrane.
When Li+ diffuses between electrodes, the corresponding
ion conduction has two terms: the intragrain and intergrain transport.
Intragrain transport indicates conduction within grain boundaries,
while intergrain transport describes the connectivity of conducting
pathways across grain boundaries. For intragrain ion transport, domain
orientation and dimensionality of the conducting pathway are the key
factors. In BCP systems, the intragrain ionic conductivity σ(T) can be expressed as10 1  where a is the morphology
factor that accounts for grain boundary effects and the geometry and
interconnectivity of the conducting phase, ϕc is
the volume fraction of the conducting phase, and σcond(T) is the intrinsic conductivity of the conducting
phase. Theoretical work of Sax and Ottino on transport through heterogeneous
media enabled calculations of the dependence of a on electrolyte morphology.23 We refer
to these calculated values as aideal,
as they do not take into account grain boundaries effects. The values
of aideal for the typical morphologies
of copolymers are presented in Figure 2e. The conducting phase (shown in blue) is the minority
block, while the majority phase is the insulating hard block (shown
in red). For the sphere morphology, aideal = 0, since there is no effective conducting pathway, σx = σz =
σy = 0. For cylinders aideal = 1/3, and for lamellae aideal = 2/3, because on average only one- or two-thirds of the grains
will contribute to the ion transport in a specific direction, respectively.
For the biocontinuous morphology (like gyroid) aideal = 1 as intragrain ion conduction is isotropic and occurs
in all directions. Nevertheless, due to grain boundaries effects and
intergrain ion transport, the experimentally determined morphology
factors, a, of BCP-based electrolytes are significantly
less than aideal, that is, a < aideal (see Table 1 in ref (24)). Cylinders forming BCP
electrolytes are strongly affected by grain orientation angles and
discontinuities in the conducting domains, and a has
been estimated to be ∼0.03, that is, an order of magnitude
lower than the theoretical intragrain transport aideal = 0.33. Notably, the morphology factors obtained
for the gyroid (bicontinuous) morphologies are much smaller than unity
and comparable with lamellar-forming BCP electrolytes.

Phase
discontinuity across grains demonstrates the necessity for
the synthesis of copolymer domains with long-range order as well as
isotropic, highly interconnected three-dimensional (3D) conducting
pathways. Eq 1 dictates
that, for the highest possible σ(T) in linear
block copolymer electrolytes, the conducting block, ϕc, should be the majority block. This would also enable the sphere
morphology composed of the insulating block (minority block) (Figure 3), while it should
be a = aideal = 1 as
the conducting phase in an interconnecting 3D matrix with no grain
boundaries. Nevertheless, such polymeric nanostructured materials
have poor mechanical properties, as their mechanical behavior is dominated
by the soft/rubbery conducting phase,25 and they were abandoned many years ago. Nevertheless, in linear
block copolymers an increase of the volume fraction insulating stiff
block in an effort to increase the mechanical response of the system
would result to a morphology change from spheres to cylinders, aideal would decrease to 1/3, and grain boundaries
effect will be introduced, that is, a < aideal. As the diblock copolymer phase diagram
dictates, such a morphological transition would occur for a volume
fraction of the stiff/insulating phase larger than 0.15–0.2%. Hence, the need for continuous pathways with the conducting domain
being the majority, which is not feasible with linear copolymers,
where the grain boundary effects are eliminated hold the key for high
conductivities.

electrolyte blends. The lines were drawn as a guide (Reprinted from

Recently, in an effort to engineer all-polymer SPEs with a morphology
akin to sphere morphology of block copolymers and independent of the
volume fraction of the involved phases, that is, not accessible before
by linear block copolymers, counterparts we introduced the use of
stiff/rigid polymer poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), nanoparticles
(PMMA-NP), composed of high-functionality star-shaped PMMA molecules,
as additives to liquid polymer PEO/LiTFSI electrolytes.26 To this end, star-shaped polymers with a large
number of polymer chains grafted together to a core, can be considered
molecules with a colloid-, particle-like character.27 Notably, at temperatures below the Tg of PMMA (∼110 to 120 °C), the PMMA polymer nanoparticles
are glassy/stiff could be used as reinforcing agents that, compared
to the widely used inorganic nanoparticles in hybrid composite electrolytes,
offer the possibility of enhancing the specific energy of a battery
device, since much lighter electrolytes could be synthesized.

It was demonstrated that, when PMMA-NP was added to the liquid
polymer electrolyte, both the elastic modulus and the ionic conductivity
of the resulting SPE increased compared to the linear blend analogues.
In particular, the addition of 53 wt % PMMA nanoparticles resulted
in SPEs that exhibited two orders of magnitude higher conductivity
and one order of magnitude higher mechanical strength as compared
to their linear PMMA blend analogues (Figure 4). At room temperature PMMA-NP/PEO/LiTFSI
electrolytes have a σ > 10–4 S/cm and G′ ≈1 MPa, and they outperform the corresponding
nanocomposite electrolytes made with the addition of silica NPs.28,29 The key to this phenomenon is the morphology of the resulting SPEs:
for the linear PMMA/PEO blends a homogeneous, single-phase material
was obtained, whereas for the PMMA-nanoparticle/PEO blends, a nanostructured
composite material was formed with highly interconnected conducting
regions, pure in liquid PEO, as the result of PMMA nanoparticle dispersion
within the liquid electrolyte. These differences in morphology resulted
in a significant decoupling of conductivity from the mechanical strength
for the PMMA-NP/PEO blends, even when the electrolyte was in the solid
state.

Lodge, Hilmyer, and co-workers, using a facile single-pot strategy,
reported the synthesis of mechanically robust nanostructured SPEs
with bicontinuous morphology with high conductivity that significantly
outperformed the best-performing PS-b-PEO based electrolytes
(Figure 5).30 The synthetic protocol that was followed resulted
in bicontinuous, nanostructured solid polymer electrolytes with interconnected
and interpenetrating domains of cross-linked PS that provided a modulus
of ∼0.1 GPa, and an ion-conducting phase (PEO domains swollen
with IL and doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(LiTFSI)) that had a conductivity higher than 10–4 S/cm at room temperature. It is interesting to note that, because
of the presence of the high glass transition PS-cross-linked network,
the SPE could maintain its robustness at temperatures close to 100
°C with significantly higher conductivity.

Recently, we proposed a facile
new approach for the synthesis of
all-polymer nanostructured solid electrolytes that exhibit an unprecedented
combination of high modulus and ionic conductivity at room temperature.31 Novel nanostructured polymer particles, composed
of miktoarm stars with a very large number of arms (functionality)
of ion conducting poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) arms that complement
stiff insulating polystyrene arms, PS, ((PS)n(PEO)n, where n = 30 the number of arms), were synthesized and added to a low molecular
weight PEO doped with LiTFSI. The addition of 44 wt % (PS)30(PEO)30 in liquid PEO/LiTFSI electrolyte resulted in SPEs
with a shear modulus of G′ ≈ 0.1 GPa
and ion conductivity σ ≈ 10–4 S/cm,
at room temperature. The SPEs showed a strong decoupling between the
mechanical behavior and the ionic-conductivity as G′ remains fairly constant for temperatures up to the glass
transition temperature of the PS blocks, while the conductivity monotonically
increased to reach σ ≈ 10–2 S/cm at T = 100 °C. Key to their performance is their morphology
that stems from the ability of the (PS)30(PEO)30 nanoparticles to self-assemble in highly interconnected structures
within the liquid electrolytes host. Harmandaris and co-workers showed
that these (PS)n(PEO)n miktoarm star-shaped
polymers, due to the unfavorable interactions between the PS and PEO
arms, form internally nanostructured particles whose final morphology
and shape critically depend on the number and length of the arms;
while the miktoarm stars with functionalities lower than 16 nanosegregate
into two main regions, resembling a structure akin to Janus particles,
the 32-arm stars form multi-patchy nanoparticles.32 As a result of their intramolecular nanostructured morphology,
when such nanostructured particles are added to a liquid PEO electrolyte,
specific interactions with the liquid electrolyte are activated, directing
their self-assembly into highly interconnected structures and promoting
the decoupling of the antagonistic properties of conductivity and
mechanical strength.33

Conventional SPEs are formed by dissolving Li
salt in a polymer
host that solvates the lithium salt. Such systems are dual conductors
as both anions and cations are mobile. In PEO-based electrolytes,
the fraction of conductivity from the cations (Li+ transference
number, tLi+) is only a small
fraction of the overall conductivity (∼1/5). The low transference
number occurs due to the strong preferential solvation of Li+ over its counteranion, resulting in a bulky solvation shell around
Li+ compared to that of typical anions.34 The large contribution from the anions leads to a strong
concentration gradient as anions accumulate at the electrode, leading
to deleterious effects such as concentration polarization. This greatly
increases cell resistance, limits cell lifetime, and promotes fast
dendrite growth that ultimately limits power delivery.

As early
as 1994, Doyle, Fuller, and Newman demonstrated the importance
of one using single-ion electrolytes for batteries applications, that
is, the use of electrolytes with tLi+ close to unity. It was demonstrated that a single-ion electrolyte
could performed better when incorporated to a battery cell when compared
to a dual-ion electrolyte having an order of magnitude larger ionic
conductivity.35 Even a modest improvement
in tLi+, that is, from 0.3,
found in simple dry PEO-based electrolytes, to tLi+ ≈ 0.7, would allow much higher charge/discharge
rates, of paramount importance in electric vehicles applications.34 To this end, the most common strategy for the
synthesis of polymer electrolytes with tLi+ close to unity is the tethering and immobilization of
anions to the polymer backbone. Among the various systems that have
been developed, including acrylate-, sulfonate-, and borate-based
polymers, polymers containing anions of (trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide
(TFSI–) have attracted considerable attention over
the last years due to the binding affinity with Li+, possess
highly delocalized negative charge over large conjugate structure
(four oxygen and one nitrogen) and good plasticizing ability for the
polymer backbone.36−39

Armand and co-workers were the first to report the synthesis
of
polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide)-b-polystyrene triblock copolymer, wherein lithium bis(trifluoromethane)
sulfonamide (LiTFSI) was covalently linked to styrene units in the
PS block (PSLiTFSI), PSLiTFSI-b-PEO-b-PSLiTFSI.37 Different triblock copolymers
were synthesized; the Mw of PEO remained
constant at 35 kg/mol, while the Mw of
each of the two PSLiTFSI blocks was varied from 1.85 kg/mol (resulting
to a [EO]/[Li+] = 69] to 13.2 kg/mol ([EO]/[Li+] = 10). The polymer electrolytes with PSLiTFSI Mw of 4.75 and 16 kg/mol showed the maximum conductivity:
σ ≈ 10–5 S/cm at 60°C, with tLi+= 0.85 and fairly good mechanical
properties (10 MPa at 40 °C). Despite the good electrochemical
stability window (up to 5 V vs Li+/Li) and improved cycling
performance in lithium metal battery prototypes, due the PEO crystallization,
at room temperature the ionic conductivity was σ ≈ 10–7 S/cm, that is, several orders of magnitude lower
than that required for practical applications. Balsara and co-workers
synthesized various PEO-b-PSLiTFSI single-ion block
copolymers and showed that the crystallization PEO at low temperatures
(i.e., at T < Tc of
PEO) drives the formation of lamellar morphology, lowering the degree
of ion dissociation, as Li+ ions are trapped in the form
of ionic clusters with the PS domains, resulting in very low conductivity
(Figure 6a,b).38,39 At temperatures above PEO melting, the material goes to a disordered
phase, and Li+ ions are efficiently released and dissociated
from the clusters, accompanying a several orders of magnitude increase
in ion conductivity. Nevertheless, in the conductivity phase the material
transforms from a rigid solid to a disordered viscoelastic liquid.

at temperatures below PEO melting temperature (T < Tm, left part) and at T > Tm (right part). At T < Tm, ions are clustered and trapped within the
PEO, microphase separated region. At T > Tm the electrolyte is disordered, amorphous,
ions are dissolved, and the Li+ ion is mobile (Reprinted

In a recent work, Balsara’s group proposed an alternative
approach for the synthesis of single-ion nanostructured polymer materials
based on the addition of functionalized silsesquioxane nanoparticles
(salty nanoparticles) to microphase-separated PS-b-PEO copolymers.40 The POSS–PSLiTFSI
nanoparticles were mixed at different loadings with PS-b-PEO and SPEs with r = [Li]/[EO] = 0.02, 0.05, 0.085,
and 0.10 were synthesized. Because of the miscibility of the PSLiTFSI
ligands with PEO, the salty nano-particles were preferentially located
in the PEO-rich phase, as it was revealed by high-resolution dark-field
scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM)/energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) measurements (Figure 6d). Regardless of the temperature, the maximum
ion conductivity was measured for [Li]/[EO] = 0.085 (i.e., for 28.4
wt % of salty POSS–PSLiTFSI nanoparticles). At 60 °C,
σ = 1 × 10–6 S/cm, while at room temperature,
σ = 8 × 10–8 S/cm; that is, a factor
of 10 lower than PSLiTFSI-b-PEO-b-PSLiTFSI and PEO-b-PSLiTFSI.37−39 In contrast
to the single-ion PEO-b-PSLiTFSI electrolytes, POSS–PSLiTFSI/PS-b-PEO remained nanostructured and rigid solid even in the
conducting state, that is, at temperature above the melting temperature
of PEO. This was attributed to the increasing segregation strength
of PS and PEO domains with the addition of the salty nanoparticles.
Furthermore, the presence of POSS–PSLiTFSI particles in the
PEO-rich domain results in tLi+ = 0.98, that is, very close to unity and larger than the reported tLi+ = 0.85 for the PSLiTFSI-b-PEO-b-PSLiTFSI single-ion electrolytes.

5 Conclusions and Outlook
In conclusion, we reviewed
the recent progress in nanostructured
all-polymer electrolytes focusing on the solid polymer electrolytes
that could simultaneously have high ionic conductivity Li+ and transference number. As is highlighted in this Mini Review,
it is necessary to design novel polymer electrolytes using designed
rules beyond that of microphase-segregated PEO block copolymer-based
electrolytes. Great efforts are still needed to overcome these obstacles
and include the following:The
very low room-temperature ionic conductivity of
PEO-based electrolytes, several order of magnitudes lower than what
is required for practical application, is still an obstacle for their
application as room-temperature Li metal batteries. Novel polymer
materials with designing rules beyond the microphase-segregated PEO
block copolymer-based electrolytes should be systematically explored.
This need stems from the fact that, in such systems, the synthesis
of electrolytes with interconnected phase in the macroscale is very
challenging, and along with the PEO crystallization results in room-temperature
conductivities that are several orders of magnitude lower than what
is required for practical applications. The findings summarized in
the Mini Review suggest that there are a couple of very promising
pathways toward the synthesis of all-polymer solid polymer electrolytes
with ion conductivity and mechanical properties close to the requirements
based on nanostructured polymer nanoparticles as additives to liquid
polymer electrolytes (Figure 5) on polymerization-induced phase separation method (Figure 4). Systematic studies
toward macromolecular optimization of the aforementioned approaches
may hold the key for their realization in lithium metal batteries.

Improving the Li ion transference number
is an important
task, since it can simultaneously reduce polarization, suppress Li
dendrite growth, and extend the lifetime of lithium metal batteries.
We expect an increasing effort to chemically and structurally modify
existing polymer chemistries in dual-ion conductors to enhance negative
charge delocalization. By doing so, both room-temperature conductivities
will be enhanced, and single-ion electrolytes with σ > 10–5 S/cm could be efficiently incorporated in safe to
use lithium metal batteries.



Considering
the rapidly growing academic and industrial interests
in developing solid polymer electrolytes for solid-state lithium-based
batteries, it is reasonable to expect important breakthroughs in the
near future.
