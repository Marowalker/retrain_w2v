Layered
semiconductor gallium telluride (GaTe) undergoes a rapid
structural transition to a degraded phase in ambient conditions, limiting
its utility in devices such as optical switches. In this work, we
demonstrate that the degradation process in GaTe flakes can be slowed
down dramatically via encapsulation with graphene. Through examining
Raman signatures of degradation, we show that the choice of substrate
significantly impacts the degradation rate and that the process is
accelerated by the transfer of GaTe to hydrophilic substrates such
as SiO2/Si. We find that double encapsulation with both
top and bottom graphene layers can extend the lifetime of the material
for several weeks. The photoresponse of flakes encapsulated in this
way is only reduced by 17.6 ± 0.4% after 2 weeks, whereas unencapsulated
flakes display no response after this time. Our results demonstrate
the potential for alternative, van der Waals material-based passivation
strategies in unstable layered materials and highlight the need for
careful selection of substrates for 2D electronic devices.

Introduction
III–VI monochalcogenides
are a relatively unexplored part
of the layered semiconductor family with the intralayer structure
X–M–M–X, where M is a group III element (Ga,
In) and X is a chalcogen (S, Se, Te). Materials in this group are
mostly hexagonal, with the exception of Te-based compounds which crystallize
in a lower symmetry monoclinic form.1 GaSe
has gained popularity in recent years because of its strong optical
absorption and potential for applications in nonlinear optics.2−4 GaTe has recently begun to generate significant interest as a possible
alternative for optoelectronic devices because it displays much stronger
absorptivity than GaSe.5 Unlike other layered
materials such as the transition-metal dichalcogenides,6 the moderate bandgap of GaTe (1.65 eV)7 remains direct from the monolayer to bulk form,
allowing for greater flexibility in selecting the thickness of the
photoactive layer. GaTe photodetectors with high photoresponsivities
(104 A/W), fast photoresponse times (6 ms) and detectivities
(1012 jones) exceeding those of even commercial InGaAs
detectors8 have been demonstrated.9,10 More recently, scalable, low-residue solution-processed GaTe devices
have been fabricated with photoresponsivities as high as 2 ×
106 A/W.11 Additionally, unintentional
p-type doping12 in GaTe presents opportunities
for p–n heterojunction devices with n-type 2D materials such
as MoS2.13,14 GaTe also demonstrates very high
levels of in-plane anisotropy, reflected in its electronic and optical
properties.15−17 However, progress in GaTe-based devices has been
hindered by poor environmental stability.18,19

2D materials are especially prone to environmental instability
because of their high surface area to volume ratio. The most frequently
studied unstable 2D material to date is few-layered black phosphorus
(BP), desirable for its high hole mobility,20 moderate bandgap,21 and strong optical
and electrical anisotropy.22 Despite this,
degradation of BP-based devices remains a significant issue. The reaction
proceeds mainly via photooxidation, with a rate that is dependent
on flake thickness, oxygen concentration, and illumination power.23 Rate of degradation in BP has also previously
been shown to be impacted by substrate choice.24

Tellurium-based layered compounds such as GaTe degrade
via a more
complex oxidation reaction. O2 intercalates between the
layers and forms bonds with highly reactive Te atoms, leading to a
structural transition to an oxide phase, confirmed via Raman spectroscopy,
photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy.19,25 This reaction is catalyzed by water and does not occur in dry air.26 The transition to the oxide phase leads to the
loss of optical anisotropy and a reduction in bandgap from 1.65 eV
to approximately 0.8 eV. This process can be partially reversed by
annealing to drive out adsorbed O2 between GaTe layers.26 A number of strategies have been proposed to
slow the oxidation process, including surface functionalization with
diazonium molecules19 and encapsulation
with passivation layers such as Al2O3.25

Despite improvements to the environmental
stability of these materials
using conventional oxides such as Al2O3,25,27−29 there are several problems associated with the deposition
of these layers on 2D materials. The lack of dangling bonds at 2D
interfaces may necessitate the inclusion of a seeding layer or pretreatment29−31 to facilitate nucleation, while the deposition process itself has
been found to be a cause of increased degradation at the surface in
very thin samples.32 Additionally, because
of the extreme sensitivity of 2D materials to external perturbations,
these passivation layers can alter the intrinsic electronic properties
of the target materials significantly33 and prevent access to novel materials engineering capabilities via
surface modification.34,35 Al2O3 passivation
may also limit applications for 2D materials in optical electronics
and wearable devices by adversely impacting their mechanical flexibility
and optical transparency.36 As a result,
encapsulation with other van der Waals materials has emerged as a
possible alternative to conventional passivation layers. Interfaces
between 2D materials are atomically sharp and can be self-cleaning.37 Van der Waals passivation in this way also has
the advantage that the capping layer could be selected to enhance
the desirable qualities of the material while simultaneously acting
as a protective layer. This has previously been realized for BP and
graphene or hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN)-based devices.38 More recently, few-layer GaSe has been stabilized
under ambient conditions via capping with h-BN.39 To the best of our knowledge, this type of passivation
is yet to be demonstrated with GaTe.

Here, we demonstrate a
method for monitoring the degradation level
of GaTe flakes using Raman spectroscopy and present a strategy to
slow this reaction via van der Waals passivation with graphene. Additionally,
we show that deposition of GaTe flakes onto conventional dielectric
layers (SiO2) accelerates oxidation, likely due to the
hydrophilicity of the substrate. We show that as a result, the addition
of a hydrophobic buffer layer such as graphene at the bottom GaTe
surface is required for effective passivation. We find that sandwiching
GaTe with graphene extends the lifetime of the material greatly, with
only minimal oxidation occurring after 2 weeks. Because previous theoretical
studies have indicated that graphene/GaTe heterostructures have the
potential to combine high photoabsorption with ballistic electronic
transport in optoelectronic devices,40,41 this passivation
strategy presents an opportunity to employ graphene layers as both
a protective layer and active component of the heterostructure which
has important implications for future device fabrication.

Results and Discussion
GaTe flakes were exfoliated from a bulk crystal onto SiO2/Si substrates and characterized using micro-Raman spectroscopy,
PL, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Figure 1a shows the Raman spectrum of freshly cleaved
and degraded GaTe. The freshly cleaved sample shows prominent peaks
at 109, 115, 162, 176, 210, 270, and 283 cm–1 in
good agreement with previous reports.25,26,42 Aged flakes exhibit only two peaks at 129 and 144
cm–1. The origin of these modes is still the subject
of some controversy. Some previous first-principles calculations have
suggested that these modes can be attributed to first42 or second-order15 Raman-active
phonon modes, whereas other groups have claimed that they appear only
as the products of the GaTe oxidation process.19,25,26 In the latter case, the similarities to
both TeO2 and aged Raman spectra of other Te-containing
compounds have been noted,19 supporting
the idea that the 129 and 144 cm–1 peaks result
from the oxidation of Te atoms at the sample surface.26 In our work, we attribute these peaks to degradation products
because they are either totally absent or extremely weak in freshly
exfoliated samples and only emerge following prolonged exposure to
air.

GaTe (bottom) and fully degraded GaTe after 7 days (top). (b) Optical

sample after 7 days. Blue dotted line in (d) shows location of the
flake height profile shown in (f) and white dashed lines show the
position of roughness profiles in (g).

The evolution of pristine to aged GaTe is evident from the loss
of the PL signal over time (Figure 1c). Freshly exfoliated samples exhibit a strong photoresponse
centered at 1.66 eV, which is consistent with the reported bandgap
of GaTe.7 The peak intensity decreases
with longer ambient exposure times, leading to a complete loss of
the signal after around 2 weeks. This is reflective of a transition
from a direct gap material to the indirect gap oxide phase.26 AFM topography scans comparing a freshly exfoliated
and one week old GaTe are shown in Figure 1d,e. A small increase in root mean square
(rms) roughness from 0.4 to 0.6 nm is observed as a result of the
transition to the oxide phase. The optical appearance of the flakes
is unchanged. Our findings are consistent with previous reports and
suggest that unlike other unstable layered materials such as BP,38 surface roughness is not a good indicator of
the level of sample degradation in GaTe.

Because we found the
changes in the Raman spectrum of GaTe with
ambient exposure to be the most significant sign of degradation, we
used Raman spectroscopy to probe the degree of sample degradation
over time. Figure 2a shows the evolution of Raman spectra over time for a 183 nm thick
GaTe flake in air. After only a few hours, peaks attributed to the
oxide phase began to appear, of which the 129 cm–1 mode was the most pronounced. As the flake continued to oxidize,
a marked increase in the intensity of the 129 and 144 cm–1 oxide peaks was observed in addition to a reduction in intensity
of the GaTe-attributed modes. After 7 days, almost all GaTe peaks
had disappeared and only the oxide peaks remained, indicating a complete
transition to the degraded GaTe phase. We studied the integrated intensity
ratios of the Raman peaks attributed to GaTe and the oxide phase over
time to develop a metric for the degree of sample degradation. Figure 2b shows a comparison
of I115/I129, I162/I129, I115/I144, and I162/I144 intensity ratios as a function of ambient exposure time. Smaller
ratios indicate a greater degree of degradation. A rapid decrease
in all ratios was observed during the first few hours of ambient exposure,
followed by a slower progression to complete oxidization, indicated
by an intensity ratio of zero, after several days. This is suggestive
of saturation of the GaTe layers with chemisorbed O2 with
increasing ambient exposure. Although each ratio displayed the same
trend, we identified I115/I129 as the best metric for sample comparisons. The 115
cm–1 peak is the strongest and last GaTe mode to
disappear with degradation, while the 129 cm–1 oxide
peak emerges earlier in the oxidation process than the 144 cm–1 mode. The I115/I129 ratio is therefore a clearer indicator of
the levels of degradation over the full range of exposure times.

To improve the environmental stability of GaTe flakes via van der
Waals layer passivation, we tested two types of the GaTe/graphene
heterostructure to determine whether graphene is an effective encapsulation
layer for GaTe. Single encapsulated samples were capped by a single
graphene flake (7 nm) transferred on top of ∼175 nm GaTe so
that it was completely covered. Double encapsulated structures were
fabricated in the same way but with the addition of an extra graphene
layer (7 nm) underneath the GaTe flake. All samples were exfoliated
from bulk crystals and transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates
(see Experimental Section). Figure 3a shows the three assembly
steps used to fabricate graphene/GaTe/graphene sandwich structures.
Optical images, AFM topography, and height profiles for each layer
are shown in Figure 3b–d, e–g, and h–j for steps 1–3, respectively.
For single encapsulated flake fabrication, the same process was followed
starting from step 2, with the deposition of GaTe directly onto the
SiO2 surface. Sample degradation over time was monitored
using Raman spectroscopy, and we confirmed the evolution of optoelectronic
properties with ambient exposure using PL.

Blue dashed lines show locations of height scans of the most recently
added layer as shown in (d,g,j).

Optical images of the single and double encapsulated samples are
shown in Figure 4a,b,
respectively. Thicknesses of all layers were confirmed in each case
using AFM. Raman spectra for graphene layers (Figure 4c) in each case agree well with literature
reports for multilayer graphene44 and the
absence of the defect-activated D peak suggests high material quality.45 Raman spectra as a function of ambient exposure
time for single and double encapsulated samples are shown in Figure 4d,e. Both samples
showed reduced degradation compared with bare GaTe which was fully
oxidized after 7 days. By contrast, both graphene encapsulated samples
still exhibit GaTe Raman modes at 115 and 162 cm–1, suggesting that neither were fully degraded even after 2 weeks.
The single encapsulated sample showed a much higher level of oxidation
than the double encapsulated, with a mean I115/I129 ratio of 0.22 ± 0.06 after
2 weeks. However, the double encapsulated flake seemed relatively
unaffected even after this time, as only very small oxidation peaks
were observed. After 2 weeks, the mean I115/I129 ratio was measured as 1.71 ±
0.17, nearly 8 times larger than the single encapsulated flake. Compared
with unencapsulated flakes, this ratio was slightly larger than the
average measured for even freshly transferred samples (Figure 2b). We suggest that this was
a result of a small amount of oxidation on contact with SiO2/Si for the unencapsulated material.

and single encapsulated

week-old single and double encapsulated flakes with graphene. Double
and single encapsulation spectra have been normalized to the peak
intensity of the fresh samples for the purposes of comparison. Raman

double encapsulated with graphene.

The superior passivation properties of double versus single graphene
encapsulation of GaTe can also be seen from the PL spectra in Figure 4d. The photoresponse
of the single encapsulated flake was reduced by around 60.4 ±
0.6%, while the double encapsulated sample experienced only a 17.6
± 0.4% intensity loss after 2 weeks. This represents a significant
improvement over unencapsulated GaTe flakes which exhibit no photoresponse
after this time.

The origin of this effect is not immediately
clear. Because the
top interfaces of both the double and single encapsulated flakes are
identical, we suggest that it must be due to the difference between
the bottom GaTe interfaces with either graphene or SiO2, respectively. To investigate this further, we transferred ∼175
nm GaTe flakes onto various substrates to compare the resulting rates
of degradation. Bare SiO2/Si and Al-coated SiO2 were chosen as primary substrates, and chemical vapor deposition
(CVD) graphene monolayers were transferred onto both to determine
the impact of the addition of bottom graphene layers on the degradation
rate. Optical images of flakes on each of the substrates tested can
be found in the Supporting Information (S1).
SiO2/Si was chosen because of its popularity as a substrate
in 2D device fabrication, while the smoother Al-coated substrate was
used as a means of investigating potential roughness effects. The
rms roughness of SiO2/Si and Al-coated SiO2/Si
substrates were measured as 0.21 and 0.13 nm, respectively (Supporting Information, S2). It was thought that
the increased substrate roughness could lead to poor contact between
the GaTe flake and the substrate, allowing for increased diffusion
of O2 and moisture from air along this interface. In this
case, a faster degradation rate on substrates with higher surface
roughness would be expected. Figure 5a shows Raman spectra of monolayer graphene on SiO2/Si and Al-coated SiO2/Si substrates. The presence
of the D peak at ≈1375 cm–1 in both samples
indicates some degree of structural disorder in the graphene layers.
However, the small D to G
(≈1580 cm–1) peak intensity ratios indicate
that the defect level is still relatively low in both samples46 (ID/IG = 0.15 for SiO2/Si and ID/IG = 0.14 for Al). The monolayer
character of graphene transferred to both substrates was confirmed
by the single Lorentzian lineshape of the 2D Raman peak (≈2700
cm–1) and small G to 2D peak intensity ratios (IG/I2D = 0.21 for
SiO2/Si and IG/I2D = 0.29 for Al).44

of degradation rates on different substrates. (a) Raman
spectra of graphene monolayers on SiO2/Si and Al/SiO2/Si substrates showing D, G, and 2D peaks at ≈1375,

(e) Al-coated SiO2/Si (θ = 68.37 ± 0.35°),
and (f) graphene on Al-coated SiO2/Si (θ = 92.88
± 0.42°).

A comparison of the I115/I129 peak intensity
ratio for all substrates is shown in Figure 5b. We observed that
the degradation rate for SiO2/Si and Al substrates was
virtually identical, and GaTe flakes transferred onto these surfaces
were again fully degraded after 1 week. This suggests that substrate
roughness is not a significant factor in GaTe sample degradation.
Placing a graphene buffer layer between the substrate and GaTe led
to a slower transition to the oxide phase on both substrates. Again,
the rates for graphene/SiO2/Si and graphene/Al are not
significantly different. It was noted that the intensity ratios of
fresh flakes transferred to the bare substrates were significantly
lower than the fresh flakes on graphene, again suggesting that some
degree of oxidation had occurred upon contact with SiO2/Si or Al substrates. We observed that the 115 cm–1 peak was still visible for the graphene/SiO2/Si sample
even after 3 weeks, suggesting that the lifetime of a GaTe flake and
potential GaTe-based devices can be extended simply by a careful choice
of the substrate.

We also tested the use of mechanically exfoliated
multilayer graphene
flakes as a substrate for GaTe (see Supporting Information, S3). The exfoliated graphene substrate flakes
were found to provide superior protection to the GaTe compared with
the CVD monolayers shown here, possibly due to a lower level of structural
defects or the presence of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) residues
on the monolayer surfaces left over from the transfer process. To
test the influence of polymer residues on the degradation rate of
GaTe, flakes were transferred to monolayer graphene surfaces with
high and low levels of PMMA residue (Supporting Information, S4). We observed that higher residue levels led
to increased degradation in GaTe, possibly due to further decomposition
of residues into oxygen-containing products.47,48

Degradation in GaTe is thought to proceed by intercalation
of molecular
oxygen between layers in the presence of moist air.26 Because the top interface is identical for all samples
(GaTe/air), there must be some feature of the SiO2/Si and
Al substrates that encourages this process compared with graphene
substrates. It has already been established above that substrate roughness
is likely not a factor; therefore there must be some other origin
for this effect. One possibility is that the variation in degradation
rates is due to the differences in the wettability of the underlying
substrates. This effect has already been observed for BP flakes,24 although the degradation mechanism for BP is
not the same as that for GaTe. Figure 5c–f shows contact angle measurements for our
substrates both covered and uncovered with graphene. SiO2/Si and Al substrates are both hydrophilic (θSiO2 = 61.51° ± 0.19° and θAl =
68.37 ± 0.35° respectively) in agreement with previous literature
reports.49,50 It is well known that hydrophilic surfaces
lead to the formation of water adlayers under ambient conditions.51 We suggest that adsorbed water on the SiO2/Si and Al substrates is trapped at the interface after deposition
of GaTe, resulting in progressive degradation due to the presence
of dissolved O2. As we observed from direct transfer of
GaTe to these substrates, this can result in some level of immediate
oxidation on contact for fresh flakes. Diffusion of water adlayers
along 2D-material/SiO2 interfaces has been previously demonstrated
with graphene.52 The mechanism is such
that even if only a small amount of water is trapped initially, the
volume may increase after flake deposition due to capillary forces
attracting water molecules from surrounding areas. Over time, it is
therefore possible for additional adsorbed moisture and O2 to be drawn along the substrate surface under the GaTe flake, degrading
the sample even further.

We suggest that the addition of a graphene
buffer layer between
the GaTe and the substrate causes the water layer to instead be trapped
at the substrate–graphene interface, avoiding contact with
the GaTe flake. Our contact angle measurements show that deposition
of a graphene monolayer on the bare substrate surfaces renders them
both hydrophobic (Figure 5d,f). Although recent experiments have shown that it is possible
for water to be adsorbed on hydrophobic surfaces under ambient conditions,53 particularly at defect sites, the area of the
substrate covered by adsorbed water is significantly smaller than
that for a hydrophilic substrate. It therefore seems likely that a
smaller volume of adsorbed water may be trapped and drawn along a
hydrophobic substrate/GaTe boundary than a hydrophilic one, leading
to a reduction in the degradation rate on hydrophobic surfaces. This
suggests that in order to fully realize the potential of GaTe as an
alternative for electronic devices, hydrophobic substrates to the
common choice of SiO2/Si are required.

To further
test the role of substrate wettability on the degradation
rate of GaTe, we transferred fresh ∼175 nm flakes onto SiO2/Si cleaned using standard solvent cleaning methods and SiO2/Si treated with a plasma cleaning process. Details of both
treatments can be found in the Experimental Section. Plasma cleaning increases the substrate wettability significantly
due to more effective removal of organic contaminants.54 We found the substrate/water contact angle was
reduced to less than 30° following plasma treatment. Figure 6a,b shows the evolution
of Raman spectra of ∼175 nm GaTe flakes on solvent-cleaned
and plasma-cleaned SiO2/Si, respectively. Fresh GaTe transferred
to the plasma-cleaned substrate was clearly degraded on contact to
a greater extent than the flake transferred to the solvent-rinsed
sample, as can be seen from the much stronger 129 cm–1 peak. This is consistent with the presence of an increased volume
of adsorbed water on the substrate surface prior to transfer. Additionally,
the plasma-cleaned sample was almost fully degraded after just two
days, suggesting that oxidation occurs much more rapidly on the more
hydrophilic surface. This was confirmed via tracking the ratio of I115/I129 peaks over
time as shown in Figure 6c.

plasma-cleaned SiO2/Si. (a,b) Measured Raman measurements
of GaTe on (a) solvent-cleaned and (b) plasma-cleaned substrates over
time. (c) I115/I129 intensity ratio as a function of time.

The potential for applications of GaTe/graphene heterostructures
has been previously highlighted elsewhere,41 particularly for photodetector and radiation detector devices.40 Despite this, no such devices have yet been
realized. This work demonstrates that the fabrication of air-stable
GaTe/graphene-based devices may be possible without the need for direct
exposure of GaTe to complex and potentially damaging processes for
deposition of conventional encapsulation layers.29−32 Photodetectors employing sandwich-type
structures with graphene similar to those presented here have already
been demonstrated for MoS2.55 A similar device employing GaTe as the active layer may offer improved
photoresponsivity and faster response times,9−11 while the graphene
layers have the potential to both improve charge transport and protect
GaTe from environmental degradation. h-BN has also previously been
employed as a 2D-material-based passivation layer38,39 and is known to be hydrophobic.56 The
use of h-BN as an alternative dielectric, coupled with graphene as
a charge transport layer presents ample opportunities for stable GaTe-based
device fabrication, particularly in the field of flexible devices
where the limiting factor is often the failure of conventional dielectric
or encapsulation layers such as Al2O3.57,58

Conclusions
We investigated the potential for van der Waals
passivation of
GaTe using graphene and quantified the level of degradation using
Raman spectroscopy. Encapsulation with graphene slows oxidation significantly,
leading to only a minimal reduction in flake photoresponse even after
2 weeks. However, we found that capping GaTe on SiO2 with
only a top layer of graphene is only partially effective and an additional
buffer layer at the bottom interface is required to further slow oxidation.
We suggest that this effect is due to the hydrophilicity of the substrate,
observing that the degradation rate can be tuned via substrate wettability.
These results have important implications for improving the environmental
stability of GaTe-based devices and suggest a need for hydrophobic
alternatives to conventional SiO2 dielectric layers.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation and Characterization
Single-crystal
GaTe bulk ingot was grown via modified Bridgman method using high
purity gallium (99.9999%, Alfa Aesar) and tellurium (99.9999%, Alfa
Aesar) powders mixed in a 1:1 stoichiometry. GaTe flakes were mechanically
exfoliated from bulk single crystals onto a PDMS stamp (Sylgard 184
Elastomer kit, Sigma-Aldrich). The approximate thickness of the flakes
was estimated by optical contrast in order to identify candidates
for transfer of a suitable thickness (∼175 nm). Care was also
taken to select flakes of similar lateral dimensions (approximately
20 μm by 20 μm) for fair comparison between samples. Flakes
were transferred onto the target substrate via a viscoelastic stamping
process.43 Moderate heating (50 °C)
of the target substrate was necessary to facilitate the process. For
fresh samples, Raman measurements were carried out immediately post-transfer.
Graphene flakes were exfoliated and transferred using a method identical
to the above from bulk HOPG purchased from Alfa Aesar. The thickness
of transferred GaTe and graphene flakes were determined via AFM measurements
(Bruker Dimension Edge).

To study substrate-dependent degradation,
commercially available graphene monolayers precoated with PMMA (Graphenea)
grown via CVD were used. This was necessary to provide a sufficiently
large area of coverage for contact angle measurements. These samples
were transferred to target substrates via a wet etching method. Copper
foil substrates were etched using a 0.1 M ammonium persulfate (Sigma-Aldrich)
solution and the graphene/PMMA stack was transferred to a bath of
water for cleaning. After spreading the graphene sheet onto the target
substrate, samples were left to dry in a fume cupboard overnight.
The PMMA support was then removed by submerging in acetone for 12
h, followed by rinsing with isopropyl alcohol (IPA) and drying in
N2.

Raman Spectroscopy and PL Measurements
Raman and PL
measurements were carried out using a Renishaw InVia Raman spectrometer
using a 488 nm laser excitation. Error bars in all calculated intensity
ratios represent one standard deviation from the mean of at least
five different measurements. In all cases, the incident power was
kept below 0.5 mW to avoid laser-induced sample degradation.

Substrate
Contact Angle Measurements
SiO2 (300 nm)/Si and
Al-coated (80 nm) SiO2/Si substrates
were cleaned in a standard process by successive rinsing in acetone
and IPA, followed by drying in N2. Plasma-cleaning of SiO2/Si was performed on an Oxford Instruments PlasmaLab 100 System
for 60 s at 40 °C and a pressure of 30 mTorr using 20 sccm O2 and 100 W RF power. The chamber was then purged with 40 sccm
Ar gas for 2 min.

For contact angle measurements, a droplet
of H2O was deposited onto the substrate to be tested and
the solid–liquid interface was imaged with a digital camera.
The image was processed in ImageJ using the dropanalysis plugin59 (LBADSA technique) to extract the contact angle.
The contact angles extracted represent the mean of three trials for
each substrate.
