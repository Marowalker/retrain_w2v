In vivo NMR of small 13C-enriched aquatic organisms
is developing as a powerful tool to detect and explain toxic stress
at the biochemical level. Amino acids are a very important category
of metabolites for stress detection as they are involved in the vast
majority of stress response pathways. As such, they are a useful proxy
for stress detection in general, which could then be a trigger for
more in-depth analysis of the metabolome. 1H–13C heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) is commonly
used to provide additional spectral dispersion in vivo and permit
metabolite assignment. While some amino acids can be assigned from
HSQC, spectral overlap makes monitoring them in vivo challenging.
Here, an experiment typically used to study protein structures is
adapted for the selective detection of amino acids inside living Daphnia magna (water fleas). All 20 common amino
acids can be selectively detected in both extracts and in vivo. By
monitoring bisphenol-A exposure, the in vivo amino acid-only approach
identified larger fluxes in a greater number of amino acids when compared
to published works using extracts from whole organism homogenates.
This suggests that amino acid-only NMR of living organisms may be
a very sensitive tool in the detection of stress in vivo and is highly
complementary to more traditional metabolomics-based methods. The
ability of selective NMR experiments to help researchers to “look
inside” living organisms and only detect specific molecules
of interest is quite profound and paves the way for the future development
of additional targeted experiments for in vivo research and monitoring.

Introduction
Metabolomics has rapidly
evolved as a powerful tool for assessing
sublethal stress in organisms.1 Nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is commonly used for metabolite
screening2−4 due to its unique benefits including rapid sample
analysis,5 minimal sample perturbation,6 high reproducibility,7 and accurate quantification.8,9 In the medical field,
NMR-based metabolomics has served a crucial role in early disease
screening,10 while in an environmental
context, it is commonly applied to understand and explain environmental
stress.7,11Daphnia magna (water flea) is well recognized as a keystone species as it consumes
algae and becomes a key prey for invertebrates and fishes, thus linking
key trophic levels in the food web.12 Due
to its environmental significance, D. magna is one of the most commonly used organisms for aquatic toxicity
testing.13 Traditional toxicity studies
generally emphasize physiological end points such as reproduction
and mortality rate, but such studies provide little information of
sublethal toxicity or the toxic mode of action (i.e., the biochemical
pathways impacted).2 A review conducted
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency entitled Toxicity
Testing in the 21st Century: A Vision and a Strategy stated “a paradigm shift must be established moving forward
to aid in our understanding of toxicity towards the underlying cellular
processes associated with generating a toxic response”.14

To obtain the most in-depth understanding
of metabolic flux in
real time requires an organism to be living. Solution-state in vivo
NMR-based metabolomics is the only modern analytical technique that
can provide detailed molecular profiles in a non-invasive manner and
allows for the assessment of metabolic changes inside a living organism
under minimal stress conditions.2−4,15,16D. magna is
an excellent test species as its small size allows it to fit inside
standard high-field NMR systems.4 For in
vivo studies, a specially designed flow system that circulates oxygenated
water to D. magna was recently developed
by Tabatabaei Anaraki et al.3 and is utilized
in this study. Amino acids represent a major class of metabolites
and have shown to be intimately linked to the vast majority of biochemical
pathways related to stress.17−20

As such, if amino acid fluxes can be selectively
detected in vivo,
they represent a key proxy for stress detection in general, which
could then be a trigger for more in-depth analysis of the metabolome.
However, when D. magna is 13C isotopically enriched and studied using nonselective experiments
such as 1H-13C HSQC, while amino acids can be
detected, overlap from a wide range of other metabolites makes spectral
assignment challenging.2−4,16 Interestingly, a range
of multidimensional protein NMR experiments have previously been used
to extract information related to protein structure21,22 and protein dynamics.23

Many of
these sequences selectively transfer magnetization between
structural units specific to amino acids (for example, carbonyl group
in combination with α protons and side-chain protons).24−26 While such approaches were developed to highlight structural features
within proteins, they can be adapted to similarly select amino acids
within mixtures or even within a living organism. Here, a 2D projection
of a 3D NMR experiment,24 termed here as
a (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha experiment, was applied to extracts and living organisms.
Both proteins and free amino acids are selectively detected, but with
the application of simple apodization functions, the proteins can
be easily suppressed during processing to leave signals from only
amino acids. For each amino acid, proton and carbon chemical shifts
are correlated for the α–β fragment, providing
enough information for easy assignment of all 20 amino acids, both
in extracts and inside the living organisms. Furthermore, nonuniform
sampling (NUS) is explored to evaluate its potential to speed up data
acquisition.27−29 Finally, the approach is tested in vivo by exposing D. magna to a sublethal concentration of bisphenol-A
(BPA) for 12 h. The technique performs extremely well and suggests
that in vivo NMR will likely develop into a very powerful tool for
detecting stress inside living systems.

Results and Discussion
1D 1H NMR Spectrum of D. magna
Figure 1 depicts
a standard 1D 1H NMR spectrum of D. magna in vivo acquired with SPR-W5-WATERGATE.30 While the water suppression is quite effective
at inhibiting the large broad water signal resulting from both the
organism and the surrounding water, the 1H signals from
the organism itself are relatively broad due to the magnetic susceptibility
variations arising from the intact sample.31 Different components such as cell walls, cell contents, and physical
structures (for example egg sack, stomach) interact with the external
magnetic field slightly differently, giving rise to field distortions
across the sample. As such, metabolite signals at varying locations
within the sample experience slightly different magnetic fields, which
leads to broadening in the final spectrum. The result is that general
regions including lipids, sugars, and some amino acids in the aromatic
region can be discerned but in large part, exact assignment of individual
metabolites is not possible from the 1H NMR alone. While
approaches such as lipid suppression techniques32−34 and newly developed 1H NMR sequences to reduce susceptibility broadening31 hold great potential, combining isotopic labeling
of the living organisms with 2D 1H–13C NMR detection has proven to be the most robust approach.3,4,35−37

Selecting Amino Acids in 13C-Enriched D. magna
Figure 2A displays a standard in vivo 2D HSQC NMR
spectrum, which contains considerable overlap in the regions dominated
by lipids and carbohydrates.2,4 Both lipid and carbohydrate
signatures are important as they are both involved in energy metabolism,
which is impacted by various contaminant stressors.3,38,39 Lipids in D. magna are of great scientific interest as daphnids are unable to synthesize
lipids de novo, leading to a reliance on food sources for these molecules.4 As such, there is still a need to better understand
the molecular processes behind the transfer of carbon between trophic
levels and the assimilation of lipids by D. magna, which can be accessed using in vivo NMR approaches.

experiment. (C) Expansion showing the in vivo (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha amino
acid profile of 13C-enriched D. magna. Note that in panel (C), the post-processing filter to suppress
proteins (described later) has been applied.

Unfortunately, due to their abundance in vivo, lipid and
carbohydrate
signals tend to dominate in vivo HSQC data, masking signals from lower-concentration
components such as amino acids.2,4 Amino acids are of particular
importance as they are involved in the vast majority of biological
responses,17,19,40,41 making them a critically important indicator
for both detecting and monitoring environmental stress. Interestingly,
as the field of protein NMR is so well developed, many different NMR
pulse programs exist that exploit specific coherence pathways within
proteins and amino acids.42−44 These often involve selectively
exciting specific structural units and then passing the magnetization
through bonds to select a particular structural motif. Although they
were developed to highlight structural features within proteins, they
can at least, in theory, be applied to select the same structural
features within mixtures or even within a living organism. To our
knowledge, such an approach has not been adapted to target specific
subgroups within mixtures.

The goal here is both to assign and
to selectively detect amino
acid signatures in vivo. As such, the ideal sequence would be proton-detected
(rather than being carbon-detected) for sensitivity, would select
all amino acids while rejecting the majority of other structures,
and would provide an additional secondary correlation to permit the
amino acids to be easily assigned. Indeed, such a 3D experiment exists
and is commonly referred to as a (H)CbCaCO(Ca)Ha correlation.24 However, as the third dimension is not required
for selecting amino acids, it can be simply collected as a 2D experiment,
termed (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha. The experiment involves five transfer steps
as outlined in Figure 2B. These steps act as a spectral filter only selecting the structural
units that contain βHC—αHC—C=O
fragments that are labeled in all carbon positions. Note that αHC and C=O are selected by using shaped RF pulses
targeted on specific chemical shift regions where the α and
carbonyl groups in amino acids specifically resonate. The result is
a relatively strict filter that specifically targets amino acids in
mixtures. When applied in vivo, the sequence performs remarkably well
and cleanly selects amino acids (see Figure 2C).

Separating Protein and Amino Acid Signals
For each
amino acid (with the exception of glycine, which only has an α
resonance), two resonances appear, one describing the 1H–13C chemical shifts of the α position and
the second describing the relayed 13C chemical shifts of
the β (i.e., adjacent) position. However, as proteins and amino
acids all contain the same structural motif, both are selected by
the sequence. Fortunately, it is relatively easy to select just the
free amino acids by applying a post-processing filter that biases
the components with longer relaxation times. This is easiest to demonstrate
in an extract from the whole organisms, as the decreased spectral
overlap provides better separation of the protein and amino acids
signals, in turn making the action of the post-processing filter easier
to discern.

Figure 3A inset shows a free induction decay (FID) processed using
a 90°-shifted sine-squared window function, commonly applied
for the processing of 2D NMR data.45 At
the start of the FID, both protein and amino acids resonate; however,
proteins have a rapid T2* (time during which a signal contributes
to the FID).46 As such, later in the FID,
the proteins relax, while the signals from the more dynamic free amino
acids persist.47 As the decay of the 90°-shifted
sine-squared window function matches the decay of a standard FID (see Figure 3A inset), all components
in the mixture are well represented when this function is used. As
such, Figure 3A contains
signals from both the proteins and amino acids. However, when an unshifted
sine-squared function is used, the start of the FID (where proteins
signals are the strongest) is suppressed, and the tail of the FID
(where signals from free amino acids persist) is exaggerated. The
result is a filter that strongly suppresses the protein signals while
emphasizing the free amino acids. When applied to the extract data
(Figure 3B), the protein
signals are strongly suppressed, while signals from the free amino
acids remain. Theoretically, such a filter may also allow very dynamic
species such as disordered proteins or peptides to be detected. However,
as shown in the next section, all the major peaks can be assigned
to free amino acids due to their relatively high concentration. As
such, the low abundance of these other species with respect to free
amino acids is enough to make them invisible to the amino acid only
experiment. However, one major exception exists—that being
glutathione (a tripeptide of glutamic acid–cysteine–glycine).
Although they are slightly broader, the glycine peak and cysteine
peaks from glutathione are clearly visible with the glutamic acid
peak overlapping with the free amino acid. The detection of glutathione
is interesting as it is closely linked to oxidative stress,48,49 and thus represents an important biomarker for in vivo research.

sine-squared bell weighing in F2 and (B) unshifted sine-squared bell

Amino Acid Assignment
Once the proteins are removed,
it becomes relatively easy to assign all 20 amino acids in the D. magna extract. Figure 4 shows an expansion of the amino acids with
the α H–C unit and corresponding relay to the β
carbon assigned. Having both the α and β carbon chemical
shifts makes assignment easier (see experimental
section) and unambiguous. When both carbons are considered,
every amino acid is well resolved with the exception of glutamic acid
and glutamine, which show some overlap due to their very similar structures.
The only non-amino acid concentrated enough to appear is lactic acid,
which has a similar βHC—αHC—C=O motif to an amino acid. However, the lactic
acid resonances are well separated from the amino acid and do not
lead to an overlap (see Figure 4A). Lactic acid is an indicator of anoxic stress (anaerobic
glycolysis), and its presence could be advantageous in the detection
of anaerobic responses.50,51

Figure 4 (A) 2D (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha
NMR spectra of a buffer extract from 13C-enriched D. magna. All 20 standard amino
acids are assigned in the spectra.
(B) In vivo 2D (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR spectra of 13C-enriched D. magna. All 20 standard amino
acids are assigned in the spectra.

Interestingly, when applied in vivo, both the protein suppression
and selective amino acid detection are highly effective (see Figure 4B). With resolution
nearly on par with the extract, as such, all 20 amino acids can be
detected and assigned. Amino acids have a direct correlation with
multiple biochemically important pathways in D. magna. Lysine is among one of the amino acids that is stored as energy
reserves during the molting cycle for crustaceans.52 The branched amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine)
are essential in muscular protein and neurotransmitter synthesis by
governing the degree of mRNA translation.53,54 Phenylalanine is the precursor to tyrosine, which is in turn used
in the production of neurotransmitters such as octopamine and dopamine55 as well as pigment compounds such as melanin.
Poynton et al.18 deduced that when exposed
to cadmium, D. magna generated l-DOPA and dopamine as a function of metal stress. Furthermore,
in crustaceans, the amines octopamine, dopamine, and serotonin are
generally perceived as neuromodulators56as well as aggression regulators.56 Another
notable biomolecule is melanin, which is also a byproduct of l-DOPA (a tyrosine derivative). For D. magna in the environment, their melanin abundance is highly important
as it acts a shield against UV radiation, while also potentially providing
visibility to predators.57 Other amino
acids such as glutamic acid and alanine are readily found in the axoplasm
of the nervous system of marine organisms constituting more than 20%
of the dry weight of the nerves.58 Amino
acids including glycine, glutamic acid, and alanine have been connected
to other important chemicals for osmoregulation in marine crustaceans
such as D. magna.59

Reducing Experiment Time via Nonuniform Sampling
The
experiment time of NMR can be appreciably reduced by employing nonuniform
sampling (NUS) strategies.60−62 Unlike standard methods that
acquire data in a linear fashion in the indirect dimension, the NUS
approach samples in a randomized fashion that can permit a net reduction
in the total experiment time of the experiment.63 The data sets obtained via NUS can later be reconstructed
in the time domain, for example, with the multidimensional decomposition
method (MDD),64,65 or taken from the frequency domain
using maximum entropy (MER)-based approaches.66,67

While higher-ordered NMR experiments (i.e., 2D or 3D) provide
additional spectral dispersion, their application is often limited
due to their longer experimental times.68 With advancements in fast NMR data acquisition techniques, such
as NUS, metabolomic analysis of complex biological samples using multidimensional
NMR becomes more feasible.69−72 In order to monitor and delineate processes that
are taking place inside a living system via NMR spectroscopy, it is
important to optimize data acquisition in the shortest time possible.19,20,40,41,73 Here, the applicability of NUS is tested
to see if 2D metabolite profiles can be captured in an accelerated
fashion while still retaining spectral information.

There is
a correlation between the number of sampling points required
and the number of cross peaks in the NMR spectra.74 Based on the selective (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR sequence applied
here, at most 39 cross peaks are expected (2 per amino acid except
for glycine that only has one) as such NUS has considerable potential
to speed up data acquisition. Figure 5 shows a series of in vivo (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR spectra
of D. magna acquired under NUS conditions
with varying sampling densities relative to the conventional spectrum
acquired with 128 points. Unfortunately, due to the peak from histidine
being extremely weak in the original data (see red circle in Figure 5C), this resonance
is lost even with a relatively conservative sampling of 50%. However,
both 40 and 50% sampling methods (Figure 5B,C) retain signals from all the remaining
19 amino acids. Even when the sampling is dropped to just 20% (26
real points), the remaining 19 amino acids are still detected, and
the experimental time is lowered from 12 to 2.4 h. Given that in some
studies, it may not always be essential to see all the amino acids,
NUS holds considerable potential for many applications.

Figure 5 A series of
2D NUS in vivo (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR spectra of in vivo 13C-enriched D. magna reconstructed
with CS. Each spectrum was collected with a sampling density of (A)
20, (B) 40, (C) 50, and (D) 100% of the 128 real points. Each dashed
line in the spectra represents the connectivity pairing of the α
and β carbon for all amino acids detected.

It is well established in the literature that as a byproduct
of
NUS reconstruction, spectral artifacts can appear, which can complicate
NMR data interpretation.75−78 To examine this, a 3D oblique view of NMR data is
shown in Figure S2. In a conventional spectrum
without NUS (Figure S2A), few artifacts
are present, and the amino acids signals predominate even close to
the noise level. With the most aggressive implementation of NUS (only
20% sampling points, Figure S2B), artifacts
appear but fortunately largely appear as negative lobes, which do
not interfere with the detection of the positive amino acid only signals.

It should also be noted that D. magna represents one of the most challenging scenarios for NMR spectroscopy
as they contain >90% water. D. magna has a weight ranging from ∼10 (24 h old) to 170 μg
(largest adults) in terms of dry weight.79 The organisms in this study were ∼4 weeks old with a dry
weight of ∼100 μg per organism. In this study, all of
the NMR spectra were recorded using 20 fully 13C-enriched
adult D. magna samples leading to only
∼2 mg of total biomass. Many other species have much higher
biomass, which will reduce the number of scans required, in turn shortening
the time needed to collect in vivo (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR spectra, especially
when NUS is employed. For example, another typical species used routinely
in aquatic toxicity testing is Hyallela azteca (water shrimp), which has an even greater biomass than D. magna at a dry weight of 0.62 mg per organism.80 As the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) increases
with the square root of the number of scans, it can be extrapolated
that 6 times more biomass would allow the amino acid-only experiment
to be performed in ∼5 min using 20% of the 128 real points
under NUS sampling. This can potentially open up the possibility of
in vivo monitoring in close to “real- time” in other
species with the current technology or possibly in D. magna with further improvements in NMR sensitivity,
or with larger-diameter (for example, 10 mm) cryoprobes, which can
hold 4–6 times more amount of sample compared to a 5 mm probe.
Furthermore, it may be possible in the future to apply the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha
experiment using a “moving window”-type approach as
previously described.81 In this case, instead
of 2D spectra being collected as separate experiments (for example,
128 increments for each 2D spectrum), the data can be continuously
sampled in a nonuniform fashion after which any time window (with
a temporal resolution equal to the time required for one increment)
can be reconstructed using NUS. The advantage is that such an approach
allows faster kinetics changes to be detected that may be missed if
the data are collected in linear blocks required for conventional
Fourier transform.

Example Application: Monitoring Metabolic
Stress Due to BPA
Exposure
Understanding toxic impacts of contaminants in aquatic
model organisms such as D. magna is
critical for setting appropriate environmental policies.4,82 A wide range of compounds entering the aquatic environment are known
to have negative impacts on D. magna even at sublethal concentrations.3,16,31,83 As a proof of principle
and to demonstrate that the amino acid-only NMR experiment can be
used to monitor stress responses in vivo, bisphenol A (BPA) was selected
as an example contaminant. BPA used widely in the manufacturing of
plastics and epoxy resins is ubiquitous in many water bodies and exhibits
adverse toxic effects at sublethal concentrations toward D.
magna.20 Amino acid concentrations
are of particular significance as their levels are perturbed in the
vast majority of stress responses, and as such, they act as an excellent
proxy to gauge first-order stress.2−4,35,36

As the same organisms are
used for the control and exposed studies and are run back-to-back
to reduce natural variation,35 it is very
easy to gauge relative changes in metabolite quantities upon exposure
to BPA. However, it should be noted that the amino acid-only approach
does not provide absolute quantification in its current form. While
it has been recently shown that quantitative 2D NMR in vivo is possible
for basic 1H-13C HSQC,84 the situation with the amino acid-only approach is more complex.
First, the sequence contains multiple INEPT and COSY-type transfers,
the efficiency of which depends on the exact coupling constants involved
and will vary for each amino acid residue. Second, the approach employs
apodization, which acts as a relaxation filter to suppress proteins;
due to different relaxation times for each of the free amino acids,
this will also impact absolute quantification.

Generally speaking,
for NMR metabolomics research, samples are
usually quantified in a relative manner by representing the change
between a control group and exposed group as a percentage change.19,40,41 As such, the amino acid experiment
in its present form is well suited for studying metabolite changes
in response to external stressors. In the future, if absolute quantification
is required, the most feasible solution may be to apply the approach
of Lewis et al.85 In this approach, a quantification
“correction factor” is calculated based on the behavior
of standards, which can then be used to correct data collected under
nonquantitative conditions for complex mixtures. Such an approach
should also hold with the addition of NUS. While artifacts from reconstruction
and sampling have, in the past, impacted the accuracy of peak integrals,72,86 modern NUS reconstruction methods such as compression sensing (as
used here) have been able to yield high peak accuracy across a high
dynamic range.87,88 As such, highly quantitative
measurements on breast cell extracts using NUS of 2D NMR data have
been recently reported.89 Finally, the
use of 2D ERETIC-based approaches,90 already
proven to give excellent quantitation of metabolites under in vivo
conditions,84 would remove the need for
internal standards, which is especially important for in vivo stress
response studies where chemical additives would be highly problematic.

Figure 6 displays
the percentage change in amino acid concentrations that were statistically
significant (paired t test, p <
0.05) with BPA exposure relative to the control. In this case, the
NUS was not used such that all 20 amino acids were detected. BPA was
added at the start of the exposure experiment and data collection
performed over 12 h. As such, the amino acids detected represent the
averaged flux occurring during the first 12 h post-exposure. The changes
in amino acid concentrations are in strong agreement with a previously
published study conducted in vitro with D. magna(20) where free amino acids were also seen
to increase upon exposure. An increase in a wide range of amino acids
could result from toxicant-induced protein damage91 or protein degradation in response to increased energy
demands.92,93 In D. magna, an increase in concentration in free amino acids is a general indicator
for oxidative stress.3,19,40 Furthermore, the implications of oxidative stress can also be confirmed
not only through protein degradation, but also by DNA methylation
as illustrated in a genomics study by Asselman et al.94 and confirmed by genomic analysis.95,96

Figure 6 Plot
of relative concentration changes in amino acids that experienced
a statistically significant change after 12 h of BPA exposure vs non-exposed
controls using 13C–1H in vivo NMR spectroscopy.
The amino acid content in the controls is normalized to 100%, and
the change in the exposed group is shown relative to this. All bars
represent the average ± SD (replicates = 3, number of organisms
per replicate = 20). Note that a change in an amino acid concentration
was regarded significant when a p value of less than
0.05 was obtained in a paired t test between the
exposed vs control populations. Each amino acid in the plot is designated
with a three-letter code.

Nagato et al.20 performed in vitro
NMR
spectroscopy of D. magna exposed to
BPA. In their study, seven amino acids were reported to increase significantly
on the order of ∼8 to 20%. Interestingly, here, 14 amino acids
are seen to flux, with an approximately 1.5-fold increase in amino
acid concentrations relative to the non-exposed controls. The difference
can be explained by considering how the in vitro analysis is performed.
For the in vitro analysis, the organisms are flash-frozen, homogenized,
and then extracted with buffer.20 The homogenization
and freezing will cause cells to break and potentially undergo macromolecular
degradation; as such, the extract represents a snap shot averaged
across all components inside the organisms. As such, a small flux
in response to BPA may be “diluted” by the large background
of amino acids that are extracted from all parts of the organism not
in flux. Conversely, for in vivo studies, the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR
experiment introduced here strongly biases the dissolved components,
with protein and bound amino acid contributions filtered out (see Figure 3); as such, it targets
the most meaningful metabolite pool, that is, the specific flux released
during a stress response. Indeed, the relative increase of 150% detected
in vivo compared to ∼8 to 20% in vitro suggests that in vivo
NMR holds great potential for the sensitive detection of stress responses
directly and represents an important and complimentary approach to
in vitro metabolomics for understanding biological processes and responses.

Conclusions
In this study, we have demonstrated that it
is plausible to selectively
target free amino acids in vivo using 13C-enriched D. magna in combination with the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha
NMR pulse sequence. Amino acid concentrations are of particular significance
as their concentration levels are perturbed in the vast majority of
stress responses, and as such, they act as an excellent proxy to gauge
stress. All 20 amino acids could be detected and assigned in living 13C-enriched D. magna. Considering
that D. magna contains ∼90%
water and very low dry mass (∼100 μg per organism), the
detection is highly encouraging and bodes well for the study of other
small aquatic species important for toxicity testing such as H. azteca, which contains ∼6 times more biomass
per organism. Nonuniform sampling shows great potential in combination
with the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha experiment given the well-defined number
of peaks expected in the amino acids metabolite pool. Furthermore,
a preliminary application used to monitor the metabolic changes of D. magna in response to BPA exposure detected 14
amino acids that increased consistently with protein breakdown related
to altered energy dynamics as previously observed.20 Interestingly, the amount of amino acids was seen to increase
by ∼150%, much higher than that seen in in vitro homogenization/extraction-based
metabolomics that detected only ∼8 to 20% increases and fewer
amino acids. This suggests that specifically targeting the amino acid
flux in vivo provides a sensitive tool to detect stress responses
and represents a key complimentary approach to more traditional nonselective
in vivo NMR approaches as well as in vitro metabolomics. To extend
this application further, other biological systems could be monitored
in vivo such as living cells.97 Some of
the work in this area has utilized 1D NMR analysis, but due to spectral
overlap in such complex NMR data sets, metabolite identification can
be challenging.98 As such, utilizing heteronuclear
2D NMR experiments to increase spectral dispersion, thereby leading
to a more in-depth analysis of metabolic flux under in vivo conditions,
is beneficial.99 The (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha NMR
experiment discussed here could be highly complementary due to its
high resolution and specificity to amino acids, which are central
to in vivo cell processes.

Experimental Section
13C-Enriched D. magna
D. magna samples were fed
99% 13C algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ) as their sole carbon source for their entire life cycle. The algae
were grown in a small-scale closed loop system photobioreactor designed
and built by Silantes GmbH. Each fermentation was carried out autotrophically
with 13CO2 (99% 13C). The environmental
conditions for growth such as media, temperature, light intensity,
and pH were optimized for maximum growth of C. reinhardtii. Whole algae cells were then collected and freeze-dried for storage
at −20 °C prior to use. A more detailed description of

D. magna samples (original colony purchased from
Ward’s Scientific
and maintained in-house since 2008) were cultured at 20 ± 1 °C
in 4 L glass vessels filled with hard reconstituted water at pH 7.5–8.5
(tap water that had been dechlorinated using an API tap water conditioning
agent for a period of 2 weeks). The cultures were kept under a 16:8
light to dark photoperiod and were fed 13C enriched C. reinhardtii (∼20 mg per 100 daphnids per
day) as their only food source. The population density was 20 daphnids
per L of culture medium. On a weekly basis, the culture medium was
changed. The culture was fed unlabeled C. reinhardtii as a method to purge gut contents of 13C media for a
24 h period prior to use in NMR experiments.2,4

Extraction Procedure
A subset of Daphna samples were extracted using buffer to compliment the in vivo NMR
assignments. For the extraction procedure, D. magna was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen to halt enzymatic activity.20 Metabolites were extracted using an aqueous
buffer.19,20 The D2O buffer composed of 0.2
M sodium phosphate dihydrate (NaH2PO4·2H2O, 99.3%, Fisher Scientific Company, Toronto, ON, Canada),
10 mg/L 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS; 97% purity,
Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) to serve as an internal reference
standard, and 0.1% w/v sodium azide (99.5% purity, Sigma Aldrich)
added as a preservative100 dissolved in
D2O (99.9% purity, Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Andover,
MA, USA). For extraction of metabolites with the D2O buffer,
600 μL of the buffer solution was added to the homogenized daphnids,
vortexed for 30 s, and sonicated for 15 min. The mixture was then
centrifuged (Eppendorf 5804R, at 14 000 rpm for 20 min). The resulting
supernatant was transferred into a new 2 mL centrifuge tube and centrifuged
again (14 000 rpm for 20 min). The supernatant was then transferred
into a 5 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin, Billerica, MA, USA) for NMR
analysis.

In Vivo NMR Flow System
For each analysis, 20 4 week-old D. magna samples were maintained inside a flow system,
which was previously described.3 Briefly,
the flow system consisted of a 5 mm NMR tube with bottom and top plugs
to maintain the organisms in the coil region. A narrower inlet supplied
food and oxygenated water, while a wider sump pump that can handle
air/water/suspensions removes the excess liquid and maintains the
water height at 4 cm, which leads to improved shimming and water suppression.3 The use of the sump pump removes the need for
filters and allows food to be introduced into the system. During in
vivo exposure studies, it is essential that the organisms be fed35 so that the response from a toxin can be easily
discerned and not be complicated by additional stress from starvation.35 Aerated water (20 ± 1 °C) was circulated
from a water reservoir at a rate of 0.5 mL per min.

Exposure to
BPA
Based on the past literature, it was
determined that the concentration required for mortality of 50% of
the population (LC50 value) was approximately 14.4 mg/L
for BPA.20 Therefore, to establish a sublethal
concentration, D. magna samples were
exposed to 15% of the LC50 value (2.1 mg/L).20 The compound was added to the recirculating
oxygenated water reservoir. To eliminate the possibility of natural
variation in the D. magna metabolite
profile due to differences in age, only fully grown adults (∼4
weeks old) were used.4 The D. magna samples were fed 12C unlabeled C. reinhardtii (1 mg per 20 mL of water) for 12 h
before analysis (to purge gut contents of 13C algae)4 inside the flow system during the control and
exposed period3,35 to eliminate the effects of starvation.
The 12C unlabeled C. reinhardtii is not detectable in 2D HSQC NMR experiments as verified in a previous
study,4 and thus changes observed during
the in vivo experiments arise from the organism utilizing its own 13C-enriched biomass. The organisms were allowed to equilibrate
inside the NMR for 3 h before starting data collection. Water containing
BPA was purged and replaced between exposures to ensure that D. magna in each subsequent control group was maintained
in clean water. The unexposed group was identical with the exception
that BPA was not introduced into the NMR flow system. The unexposed
control groups (60 Daphnia in total, 20 × 3
replicates) functioned as a reference (60 Daphnia in total, 20 × 3 replicates) to which each exposed population
was then compared against.19,20,40 The exposed group was the same organisms as the control group, and
the control and exposure studies were performed back-to-back without
removing the organisms from the NMR. This procedure was recently introduced
and significantly reduces natural variation in in vivo NMR versus
using separate control populations.35

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR experiments were performed
on a Bruker Avance III-HD 500 MHz NMR spectrometer equipped with a
triple resonance TCI (1H,13C,15N)
Prodigy cryoprobe. All samples were controlled at a temperature of
20 °C during NMR data acquisition. A sealed D2O lock
capillary (5 μL) was used for all in vivo experiments in order
to separate the solvent from the organisms.2−4 For all NMR
experiments used in this study, a repetition time of 1 s was used
between successive scans. The 90° pulse was calibrated for each
sample in the study. The 1H 1D NMR spectra were acquired
with 256 scans and used shaped presaturation water suppression by
gradient-tailored excitation with W5 pulse trains (SPR-W5 WATERGATE)101 using a binomial delay of 125 μs in combination
with a train of 1000 2 ms rectangle-shaped pulses centered on the
water during the recycle delay.2−4 Both HSQC and 2D (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha
NMR experiments were collected in phase-sensitive mode using Echo/Antiecho-TPPI
gradient selection.3,35,36 The pulse sequence code for the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha experiment is provided
in Supporting Information, Section 3. HSQC spectra were collected
with 2112 time domain points (F2), a 1JCH coupling of 145 Hz, and 1030 scans for each of the
128 increments in the F1 dimension. F2 was processed using an exponential
function corresponding to line broadening of 8 Hz and F1 using sine-squared
functions with a π/2 phase shift. (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha spectra were
collected as 2D experiments. F3 (1H) was collected using
276 scans and 1926 data points for each of the 128 increments in the
F1 (13C). The F2 dimension was not incremented during data
collection such that the result was a 2D experiment. To suppress the
protein signals, an unshifted sine-squared function was applied to
the F3 dimension during processing. F1 was zero-filled to 512 points,
and a sine-squared functions shifted by 90° was applied during
processing. The HSQC experiment employed GARP-4 decoupling, and the
(H)CbCa(COCa)Ha experiment incorporated both GARP-4 (13C) and WALTZ-65 (1H) decoupling. All other parameters
for the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha experiments were set in accordance with the
original NMR pulse sequence.24 The NUS
spectra were acquired with 276 scans, and sampling densities of 20,
40, 50, and 100% of the 128 points in F1 were tested. Reconstruction
of the NUS spectra was executed with the compressed sensing (CS) algorithm88 available within the Bruker software TopSpin
3.5.

All of the 2D NMR spectra from the exposure analysis were
acquired with the (H)CbCa(COCa)Ha pulse sequence and manually calibrated
to the glycine peak (δ = 3.56 (1H ppm), 43.95 (13C ppm)). Data analysis was performed with Analysis of Mixtures
(AMIX, version 3.9.14, Bruker BioSpin). The peak volumes were measured
using the multi-integration function. The integration regions were
centered on the peak of interest, and their size was optimized in
a manner that allowed the entire peak to be integrated while minimizing
the overlap with neighboring peaks. Identical integration regions
were used for all spectra collected. To discern metabolic changes
between exposed individuals and the control, the change in peak volumes
in the exposed population is expressed as a relative percentage change
in comparison to the control.102 To assess
whether the changes in amino acid concentrations were statistically
important, a paired t test103−106 was applied on the control and exposed BPA NMR data. A p value below 0.05 was used as the cutoff for statistical importance
and is a widely approved criterion in metabolite analysis for aquatic
toxicity testing.19,20,40,107 A custom R-script (R Core Development Team,
2019) was written in-house for computing the paired t test on the BPA exposure data. The statistically important p values generated from the R-script are provided in Table S1.

Metabolite Identification
Spectra were calibrated against
amino acid chemical shifts in the Bruker biofluid reference compound
database (v.2.0.0-2.0.5) using a protocol developed earlier for complex
mixtures.108 For each amino acid, both
the HSQC data and COSY data from the biofluid reference compound database
were used. First, the α H-C unit was matched in HSQC. Afterward,
the COSY correlation from the α proton was used to identify
the 1H chemical shift of the neighboring β proton.
The β carbon chemical shift was then obtained via back reference
to the HSQC data. Due to the significant reduction of overlap afforded
by the amino acid selective pulse sequence, it was relatively easy
to assign all 20 common amino acids both in the extract and in the
living organisms. The chemical shifts of the identified compounds
were compared with the database values (r2 = 0.99, σ = 0.01) to gauge the quality of spectral assignments
(see Figure S1).
