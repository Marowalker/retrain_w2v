Taking
inspiration from natural photonic crystal architectures,
we report herein the successful fabrication of zirconia inverse opal
(ZrO2 IO) thin-film photonic crystals possessing striking
iridescence at visible wavelengths. Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)
colloidal crystal thin films (synthetic opals) were first deposited
on glass microscope slides, after which the interstitial voids in
the films were filled with a Zr(IV) sol. Controlled calcination of
the resulting composite films yielded iridescent ZrO2 IO
thin films with pseudo photonic band gaps (PBGs) along the surface
normal at visible wavelengths. The PBG position was dependent on the
macropore diameter (D) in the inverse opals (and
thus proportional to the diameter of the PMMA colloids in the sacrificial
templates), the incident angle of light with respect to the surface
normal (θ), and also the refractive index of the medium filling
the macropores, all of which were accurately described by a modified
Bragg’s law expression. Au/ZrO2 IO catalysts prepared
using the ZrO2 IO films demonstrated outstanding performance
for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the presence
of NaBH4, which can be attributed to the interconnected
macroporosity in the films, which afforded a high Au nanoparticle
dispersion and also facile diffusion of 4-nitrophenol to the catalytically
active Au sites.

1 Introduction
Intriguing,
ingenious, and diverse are the mechanisms by which
nature uses submicron-scale periodic architectures called photonic
crystals to create structural color.1−14 A characteristic feature of structurally colored materials is their
iridescence or color change with viewing angle with respect to a fixed
white light source (cf. pigment-based colored materials that generally
look the same color at all illumination and viewing angles). The striking
iridescence shown by photonic crystals arises from the selective diffraction
of certain wavelengths of white light on one-dimensional, two-dimensional
(2D), or three-dimensional (3D) periodic structures within the material,
where typically the periodicity is comparable to visible wavelengths
(400–700 nm). Figure S1 shows digital
photographs for some common naturally occurring structurally colored
objects, as well as scanning electron microscopy images of the periodic
dielectric structures responsible for the iridescent colors of these
objects. These examples serve to highlight key concepts exploited
here in our research aimed at the fabrication of ZrO2 inverse
opal thin-film photonic crystals. In Paua shell (Haliotis
iris), 400 nm-thick tiles of calcium carbonate add
mechanical strength to the molluscs shell, but also cause the shell
to diffract strongly at both near-infrared (first-order diffraction)
and visible (second-, third-, and fourth-order diffraction) wavelengths.12 The eye in the display feathers of the peacock
(Pavo cristatus) contains 2D arrays
of melanin rods, with the diameter of the rods depending on the location
in the eye (rods in the green part have a diameter of around 140 nm,
whereas rods in the orange part have a slightly larger diameter of
∼150 nm).13 Finally, precious opal
obtains its color from a face-centered cubic (fcc) (3D) arrangement
of monodisperse spherical silica (SiO2) colloids, with
colloid diameters typically in the range 200–300 nm.14 The diffracted wavelengths in opals increase
with colloid diameter (i.e., at normal incidence, opals made of 200
nm colloids reflect in the violet, those made from 250 nm colloids
in the green, and those made from 300 nm colloids in the red). Light
refraction and diffraction leading to color in opal-based photonic
crystals are depicted in Figure S2 and
have been discussed in depth below.15−24 In each of the examples in Figure S1,
a dark background provided by protein or a sandstone matrix enhances
the color play of the photonic crystal architecture, making the iridescence
more vivid. These are but a brief snapshot of the diverse architectures
used in nature to generate structural color. Physicists and engineers
are now using “top-down” approaches25−28 and chemists and biologists are
using “bottom-up” approaches29−69 to fabricate photonic crystals operating at near-infrared wavelengths
(for optical communications, especially waveguides, fiber-optic cables,
fast optic switches, etc.) and visible wavelengths (sensing, high-efficiency
laser cavities). Nature serves as a valuable teacher for technology
breakthroughs in these areas.

Among the methods used by chemists
for photonic crystal fabrication,
the colloidal crystal template approach is arguably the most popular
due to the diverse range of photonic crystals that can be obtained.42−69 The first step in this approach is the synthesis of monodisperse
polymer or silica colloids via surfactant-free emulsion polymerization
or the Stöber method,30−33,42,48 respectively, followed by the crystallization of these colloids
to form a colloidal crystal or synthetic opal (typically a face-centered
cubic array of colloids with a solid fraction of 74 vol %). Due to
the high interfacial surface free energies of submicron-sized spherical
colloids, polymer and silica colloids tend to spontaneously self-assemble
to form well-ordered colloidal crystals, which assists this fabrication
route. Strategies used to form colloidal crystals from aqueous or
ethanoic colloidal dispersions include gravitational sedimentation,
centrifugation, evaporation, and various “falling meniscus”
methods.33−42,70−74 The latter methods are especially amenable for colloidal
crystal thin-film deposition on planar substrates (this is preferable
if detailed optical analyses are going to be performed on the colloidal
crystals and their inverted replicas). In the subsequent stage of
the colloidal crystal templating strategy, the colloidal crystal (i.e.,
opal) is used as a sacrificial template to fabricate inverse opal
replicas, comprising a face-centered cubic array of air spheres (macropores)
in a solid matrix.42−69 To obtain the inverse opal, the interstitial voids in the colloidal
crystal template (26 vol % of the structure) are filled with a solid
material via sol–gel, electrochemical, or nanoparticle infiltration
methods, after which the original colloidal crystal template is selectively
removed by dissolution or calcination (heating in air). A multitude
of inverse opal-based photonic crystal materials have been synthesized
by this strategy, including metals, metal oxides, conducting polymers,
and carbon materials.29,42−69 The three-dimensionally ordered macroporous structure of inverse
opals, together with their inherent photonic crystal properties, creates
new opportunities in optical sensor development, separation, photocatalysis,
and catalysis, among others. Particularly valuable in this context
are inverse opal thin films suitable for “on chip” diagnostic
or sensing applications, though reliable design strategies toward
large-area inverse opal thin films are currently limited, prompting
further research in this area.

In response, our group has been
targeting new and approved approaches
toward inverse opal thin films, primarily metal oxides42,62−66 and conducting polymers.67−69 Zirconia (ZrO2) attracts
particular interest owing to its high thermal stability and chemical
inertness, leading to end applications in high-performance ceramics,
catalysis, sensing, and high-temperature fuel cell applications.48,49,75−80 Herein, we report the first successful fabrication and detailed
optical characterization of ZrO2 inverse opal thin films.
Evaluation of the performance of the zirconia inverse opal (ZrO2 IO) films for refractive index sensing and catalytic applications
was a further aim of the research. At this point, it should be mentioned
that most of the methodologies introduced here for the fabrication
and characterization of the ZrO2 IO thin films were developed
in undergraduate teaching labs in Advanced Physical Chemistry (CHEM
310) and Materials Chemistry (CHEM 380) at the University of Auckland.
Indeed, 4–12 weeks undergraduate research projects based on
photonic crystal fabrication by the colloidal crystal template method
have proved extremely popular with final year BSc students and honors
program students, offering a rich tapestry of open-ended learning
experiences that encompass, but are not limited to, emulsion polymerization
for polymer colloid synthesis, colloid crystallization techniques,
colloidal crystal templating strategies, sol–gel chemistry,
optical characterization techniques (UV–vis transmittance and
reflectance), computational modeling of photonic band-gap structures,
as well as hands-on exposure to advanced characterization techniques
not normally accessed by undergraduates (scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)/energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), transmission electron
microscopy (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS), N2 physisorption). Parallel research around natural
structurally colored materials such as iridescent beetles, bird feathers,
and so forth has allowed students to greatly extend their knowledge
of color and how it is generated (i.e., extending beyond the norms
such as pigment-based color, transition-metal complexes, charge-transfer
complexes, fluorescence and phosphorescence, chemiluminescence), culminating
in enhanced student interest in higher postgraduate programs. Methodologies
introduced here for inverse opal thin-film fabrication are designed
to be easily adopted elsewhere to enhance chemistry-based teaching
programs.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials
Methyl methacrylate (99%,
Aldrich), 2,2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride
(97%), zirconium(IV) propoxide (70 wt % in 1-propanol), concentrated
HCl (37 wt %), tetrachloroauric acid trihydrate (≥99.8%), urea
(99%), sodium borohydride (%), and 4-nitrophenol (%) were all obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification. Methanol
(99%), ethanol (99.4%), acetone (99%), n-heptane
(99.5%), benzene (99.7%), dichloromethane (99%), carbon tetrachloride
(99.5%), toluene (98%), and bromobenzene (95%) were obtained from
local suppliers. Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm resistivity) was
used in all experiments.

2.2 Synthesis of Monodisperse
Poly(methyl methacrylate)
(PMMA) Colloids
Three batches of monodisperse PMMA colloids
with diameters of 317, 360, and 441 nm (denoted PMMA #1, PMMA #2,
and PMMA #3, respectively, in the text below) were synthesized by
the surfactant-free emulsion polymerization of methyl methacrylate
at temperatures between 70 and 80 °C (Table S1, Figure S3), following procedures introduced by Schroden
et al. with a few modifications.48 Briefly,
a volume of methyl methacrylate (0.3 or 0.4 L depending on the batch)
and water (1.6 L) was heated under vigorous mechanical stirring and
a N2 atmosphere to the desired reaction temperature (70,
75, or 80 °C). Subsequently, 2′-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine)
dihydrochloride (1.5 g) was quickly added to initiate the polymerization
reaction, which was then continued for 3 h at the specified reaction
temperature. Finally, the PMMA colloid suspensions were quickly cooled
to room temperature, filtered through glass wool, and stored in glass
Schott bottles for later use.

2.3 Fabrication
of PMMA Colloidal Crystal Thin
Films
PMMA colloidal crystal (PMMA CC) thin films on glass
microscope slides were fabricated using the flow-controlled vertical
deposition (FCVD) method outlined in Figure S4a,b. Briefly, 20–25 mL of the PMMA colloid suspensions obtained
in Section 2.2 was
diluted with water to a volume of 500 mL, which was then poured into
a vertical-walled glass beaker. Glass microscope slides were then
immersed vertically in the diluted colloid suspension, after which
a peristaltic pump slowly removed the colloidal suspension (pump rate
about 0.3 mL min–1). As the meniscus of the colloid
suspension moved down the glass slide, colloidal crystals of thickness
5–7 μm (18–25 layers of colloids) were deposited.
In general, the FCVD method proved superior to an evaporation method
(Figure S4c) also trialed for colloidal
crystal fabrication.

2.4 Fabrication of Zirconia
Inverse Opal Thin
Films
ZrO2 IO thin films were prepared using the
colloidal crystal templates fabricated above. Briefly, a Zr(IV) sol
was first prepared by adding Zr(IV) propoxide in 1-propanol (5 mL)
to 5 mL of methanol under vigorous stirring, followed by the addition
of concentrated HCl (2 mL) and water (2 mL). The resulting mixture
was stirred for 30 min to give a clear and homogeneous sol, after
which it was diluted 5-fold with methanol. For the colloidal crystal
infiltration step, the coated glass slides were placed on a slight
incline (∼5°), after which 3–4 drops of the diluted
Zr(IV) sol were placed on the uppermost edge of the colloidal crystal
film. Gravity and capillary action then allowed the sol to infiltrate
all the interstitial spaces in the film. After hydrolyzing and drying
for 24 h at room temperature, the resulting ZrO2/PMMA CC
composites were then calcined using the following protocol: heating
from room temperature to 300 °C at 2 °C min–1, holding at 300 °C for 2 h, heating from 300 to 400 °C
at 2 °C min–1, then holding at 400 °C
for 2 h. Finally, the films were cooled to room temperature and then
subjected to detailed characterization.

2.5 Fabrication
of Au/ZrO2 IO Catalysts
Gold nanoparticles were
deposited on ZrO2 IO films at
nominal weight loadings of 5 and 18 wt % using a modified version
of the procedure described by Zanella.81 Briefly, the ZrO2 IO films were immersed in a 100 mL
aqueous solution containing a certain amount of HAuCl4·3H2O and urea (1 g) and then heated to 80 °C and kept at
this temperature for 4 h. By increasing the amount of HAuCl4·3H2O in the solution, the amount of gold deposited
on the films could be systematically increased. After reaction for
4 h, the films were rinsed with water, dried in air at 90 °C,
and then heated to 300 °C for 1 h to reduce adsorbed Au(OH)3 or Au2O3 to metallic Au0 nanoparticles.

2.6 Characterization
SEM micrographs
were taken using a Philips XL-30S Field Emission Gun scanning electron
microscope (FEGSEM) operated at an electron accelerating voltage of
5 kV in high vacuum. Prior to analysis, specimens were mounted on
black carbon tape and sputter coated with platinum for 60 s with a
Quorum Q150RS.

TEM images were collected on a Tecnai T12 transmission
electron microscope operating at an accelerating voltage of 120 kV,
equipped with a 4 megapixel camera. Specimens were dispersed in ethanol,
and then a drop of the resulting dispersion was placed on a holey
carbon-coated copper TEM grid. The ethanol was then allowed to evaporate
at room temperature for several hours before sample imaging.

X-ray powder diffraction patterns were obtained on a Siemens D5000
X-ray diffractometer equipped using a Cu Kα1 source
(λ = 1.5418 Å, 40 mA, 40 kV). Data were collected over
the 2θ range of 2–100°, with a step size of 0.02°
and a scan rate of 2° min–1. ZrO2 crystallite sizes (L) were estimated from the X-ray
powder diffraction data using peak line widths and the Scherrer equation.82

XPS data was collected on the soft X-ray
Beamline at the Australian
Synchrotron. The endstation was equipped with a hemispherical electron
energy analyzer and an analysis chamber of base pressure ∼1
× 10–10 Torr. Spectra were excited using monochromatic
Al Kα X-rays (1486.69 eV). Core-level scans were collected over
the Zr 3d and Au 4f regions with an analyzer pass energy of 20 eV.
The binding energy scale was calibrated against the C 1s signal at
285.0 eV from adventitious hydrocarbons.

N2 physisorption
isotherms for the ZrO2 inverse
opals were collected at 77 K on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000. Specific
surface areas and pore sizes were calculated from N2 physisorption
isotherms according to the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)83 and Barret–Joyner–Halenda84 methods. Prior to analysis, samples were heated
at 180 °C overnight in a vacuum oven.

UV–vis transmittance
spectra for the PMMA colloidal crystal
films and ZrO2 inverse opal films were recorded over the
wavelength range 300–1100 nm on a Shimadzu UV-1700 spectrometer,
equipped with a custom-built sample holder for UV–vis transmittance
measurements at different film angles to the sample beam path.

The photonic band-gap structure diagram for the ZrO2 IO
films was created using the MIT photonic-band package. Fully
vectoral eigenmodes of Maxwell’s equations with periodic boundary
conditions were computed by preconditioned conjugate-gradient minimization
of the block Rayleigh quotient in a planewave basis, along the high-symmetry
directions U-L-Γ-X-W-K for an fcc first Brilluoin zone.85 The additional parameters for ZrO2 calculations are as follows: rsphere = 1.06 and neff = 2.1.

2.7 Catalytic
Activity Tests
The reduction
of 4-nitrophenol at room temperature with sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as the reductant was used to test the activity of the ZrO2 IO and Au/ZrO2 IO catalysts. In a typical experiment,
catalyst (2 mg) was added to aqueous 4-nitrophenol (0.15 mM, 25 mL)
with stirring. Then, 2.75 mL of the resulting dispersion was added
to a standard quartz cuvette (path length 1 cm). To start the reaction,
0.25 mL of freshly prepared NaBH4 (0.1 mol L–1) was then added. The reaction progress was monitored by collecting
UV–vis absorption spectra every 30 s from 250 to 600 nm. The
absorbance at 400 nm was monitored as a function of time, and pseudo-first-order
rate constants (k′) for the reduction of 4-NP
were calculated from the slopes of plots of ln(At/A0) versus t.

3 Results
3.1 Structural and Optical
Characterization of
the PMMA Colloidal Crystal Films
The colloidal crystal template
technique relies heavily on the synthesis of monodisperse spherical
colloids and their subsequent self-assembly to form well-ordered colloidal
crystals. Accordingly, preliminary SEM and UV–vis characterization
studies were performed on PMMA CC #1, PMMA CC #2, and PMMA CC #3 thin
films to assess their suitability as templates for ZrO2 inverse opal fabrication. Figure 1 shows the SEM images along the [111] direction for
films fabricated from each PMMA colloid batch. In each case, the films
crystallized with their fcc (111) planes parallel to the underlying
glass substrate. Further, each batch was found to be highly monodisperse,
with all colloids in each batch having the same size resulting in
very sharp spots in the Fourier transforms performed on the SEM images
(see insets in Figure 1a,c,e). In the higher magnification images, small necks can be seen
between neighboring colloids, which likely formed during the drying
of the colloidal crystals. This necking adds a degree of mechanical
strength to the PMMA colloidal crystals, which is beneficial for colloidal
crystal templating (see below). The diameters of the colloids, calculated
as the center-to-center distance between adjacent colloids on the
(111) planes, were 317, 360, and 441 nm for PMMA CC #1, PMMA CC #2,
and PMMA CC #3, respectively (Table 1). The colloidal crystal films developed some cracks
during fabrication and SEM imaging (Figure S5a) but generally had very acceptable structural uniformity. Colloidal
crystal film thicknesses were typically in the range of 5–7
μm (Figures S4d and S5b).

The PMMA colloidal crystals
all showed structural color, especially
when viewed at grazing angles that shifted their photonic band gaps
(PBGs) along the [111] and [200] directions into the visible region.
UV–vis transmittance spectra for the PMMA colloidal crystal
films collected along the [111] direction, that is, normal to the
(111) planes, are shown in Figure 2. PMMA CC #1, PMMA CC #2, and PMMA CC #3 gave intense
PBGs along the [111] direction (θ = 0°) at 707, 802, and
983 nm, respectively (Table 1). Note that here we have collected transmittance spectra
rather than reflectance spectra, and as such the PBGs will appear
as sharp dips in transmittance (by convention we still use the term
λmax here to describe the PBG position). The shift
in the PBG position (λmax) to longer wavelengths
with increasing colloid diameter (D), and hence increasing
interlayer spacing along the [111] direction, is in perfect accord
with predictions of the modified Bragg’s law expressions below,48,63 which consider both refraction and diffraction of light in opal-based
photonic crystals (Figure S2). For first-order
diffraction on any fcc plane of an opal-based photonic crystal (including
inverse opals), the position of the PBG can be described by the following
equation 1  where λmax is the PBG position
(in nm), dhkl is the interlayer spacing
for a particular (hkl) plane, θ is the incident
angle of light with respect to the normal of the plane, and navg is the average refractive index of the photonic
crystal, typically calculated as navg =
[ϕnsolid + (1 – ϕ)nvoid], where ϕ is the solid volume fraction
and nsolid and nvoid are the refractive indices of the solid and void components,
respectively. Note for a PMMA colloidal crystal in air with an ideal
solid volume fraction of 0.74, navg =
(0.74 × 1.492 + 0.26 × 1.00) = 1.364. For first-order diffraction
on fcc (111) planes, eq 1 transforms to eq 2 since d111 = 0.8165D. 2  When θ = 0°, eq 2 reduces further to 3  Thus, the PBG position for first-order diffraction
along the [111] direction should be directly proportional to D (i.e., λmax = 2.23 × D), in excellent accord with the shift in the PBG position to longer
wavelengths seen on going from PMMA CC #1 to PMMA CC #3 (Figure 2 and Table 1). The normalized PBG bandwidths
(Δλ/λmax) and PBG angular frequencies
(a/λmax) were near identical for
all three different colloidal crystals, consistent with their identical
construction (differing only in the colloid diameter). As predicted
by eq 2, the PBGs along
the [111] direction blue-shifted as the incident angle of light with
respect to the [111] direction increased (Figure 2). Plots of λmax2 versus sin2 θ yielded straight lines (r2 > 0.995, Figure 2d). Values of D, navg, and ϕPMMA determined from
the slopes (−1.6332D2) and y-axis intercept (1.6332D2navg2) for the colloidal crystal films were in excellent accord with expectations
(Table 1, columns 4–6).

As the incident angle of light increased from 0 to 25°, the [111]
PBGs blue-shifted in accordance with eq 2. (d) Plot of λmax2 versus
sin2 θ for the PMMA CC films.

3.2 Structural and Optical
Characterization of
ZrO2 Inverse Opal Films
After the colloidal crystal
templating step, brightly colored films were obtained, indicating
the success of the inversion process. Whereas the PMMA colloidal crystals
(opals) were constructed from solid spheres with air in between, the
inverse opal replicas comprised a face-centered cubic array of air
spheres (macropores) in a ZrO2 matrix (Figure 3). When viewed along the [111]
direction, the ZrO2 IO #1, ZrO2 IO #2, and ZrO2 IO #3 films appeared purple, green, and orange, respectively.
UV–vis transmittance spectra collected along the [111] direction
(θ = 0°) revealed band gaps at 462, 526, and 635 nm (Figure 4), consistent with
the reflected color of each film. In agreement with eq 2, the PBG along the [111] direction
shifted to shorter wavelengths as the incident angle of light was
increased with respect to the [111] direction. Values of D, navg, and ϕZrO2 obtained from plots of λmax2 versus
sin2 θ (Figure 4d) are listed in Table 1. Figure 4e,f shows a ZrO2 IO #2 film illuminated and viewed along
the [111] direction and at an angle of 30° with respect to the
angle of illumination, respectively. Note the striking color change
with angle—graphic evidence for the successful realization
of structural color in the films.

films in air, illuminated and viewed along the [111] direction.

films. (e) Digital photograph of ZrO2 IO #2 illuminated
and viewed along the surface normal, and (f) the same film illuminated

with respect to the surface normal.

As with the PMMA colloidal crystal templates, the PBG position
along the [111] direction for the ZrO2 IOs shifted to longer
wavelengths as D increased (Table 1 and Figure 5a). The normalized PBG bandwidths (Δλ/λmax) and PBG angular frequencies (a/λmax) were also very similar for the three different samples,
consistent with expectations for ZrO2 IOs of comparable
solid volume fraction (0.12–0.16). The a/λmax value of 0.77 found for ZrO2 IO #2 and ZrO2 IO #3 agreed perfectly with the value predicted in the photonic
band-gap structure diagram for a ZrO2 IO with a solid volume
fraction of around 0.12 (Figure 5b). In the diagram, a pseudo photonic band gap opens
between the second and third bands along the L →
Γ or [111] direction at a/λmax = 0.77, as indicated by the blue shaded area.

opal, showing a pseudo photonic band gap at a/λ
= 0.77 (indicated by the blue shaded area) between the second and
third bands along the fcc L → Γ direction.

It should be noted here that on
transforming the PMMA colloidal
crystals to their inverse opal replicas, the center-to-center distances
between spheres on the fcc (111) planes decreased by ∼18–22%.
The theoretical maximum solid volume fraction for the inverse opals
is 0.26, but the actual values were approximately one half of this
(ϕZrO2 = 0.12–0.16). The data suggests
that the during the template removal process, the films cracked and
shrunk to form small islands on the glass microscope slides, though
clearly the islands retained the desirable (111) orientation of the
PMMA colloidal crystal templates (Figure 3). Further evidence in support of this theory
is found in the SEM images of Figure S5c–f, where an island of ZrO2 IO is seen (Figure S5e). In addition, some cracks and other defects can
be seen in film cross sections (Figure S5c,d), although these defects seem to have little detrimental effect
on the optical properties of the ZrO2 IO #2 film.

ZrO2 can exist in three different polymorphic forms,
monoclinic, tetragonal, and cubic, with the cubic form being the most
thermodynamically stable.86,87 Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns (Figure S6) for the ZrO2 IOs confirmed that all were composed of tetragonal ZrO2 (space group P42/nmc), consistent with the literature related to ZrO2 crystals
obtained by mild calcination of amorphous zirconia precursors.86,87 The broadness of the XRD peaks is evidence for the presence of nanocrystalline
ZrO2 in the walls of the inverse opals. Using the Scherrer
equation,82 ZrO2 crystallite
sizes were estimated to be 3–5 nm. The ring structures seen
in the selected area diffraction pattern for ZrO2 IO #2
(Figure 8a) validated
this size estimate.

3.3 Refractive Index Sensing
Using ZrO2 Inverse Opal Films
One of the most
fascinating and intriguing
features of the ZrO2 IO thin films was their dramatic color
change on being wetted by water or other liquids. As indicated in eqs 1–3, the photonic band-gap position (λmax) is
highly dependent on the average refractive index of the photonic crystal.
On filling the macropores in the ZrO2 IO films with liquids
of increasing refractive index, navg will
increase, and thus the PBG along the [111] direction is predicted
to shift progressively to longer wavelengths (i.e., red shift). Figure 6a,b shows UV–vis
transmittance spectra collected for ZrO2 IO #1 and ZrO2 IO #2 films, respectively, in air and then liquids of increasing
refractive index. Liquids used were methanol (n =
1.329), ethanol (n = 1.361), n-heptane
(n = 1.388), dichloromethane (n =
1.4241), carbon tetrachloride (n = 1.4601), benzene
(n = 1.501), and bromobenzene (1.558). As the refractive
index of the liquid increased, the PBG along the [111] direction shifted
progressively to longer wavelengths. The large change in the color
of the ZrO2 IO #1 and ZrO2 IO #2 films on going
from air to ethanol is apparent in the digital photos provided in Figure 6. ZrO2 IO #1 changed from purple to yellow, and ZrO2 IO #2 changed
from green to red. Once the ethanol evaporated from the films, the
original purple and green colors of the films returned.

Figure 6 (a, b) UV–vis
transmittance spectra collected along the
[111] direction for different ZrO2 inverse opal thin films
in air (n = 1.000) and solvents of increasing refractive
index (ranging from methanol, n = 1.329, to bromobenzene, n = 1.558). For both samples, the PBGs progressively red-shifted
as the refractive index of the solvent filling the macropores in the
films increased. Insets in (a) and (b) shows contact angle data for
a water droplet on each ZrO2 IO film. The digital photographs
below the spectra show each ZrO2 IO film in air and ethanol,
separately.

Surprisingly, the ZrO2 IO films were quite hydrophobic,
giving water droplet contact angles ranging from 120 to 124°
(Figure 6a,b, insets).
These values were independent of the macropore diameter in the ZrO2 IOs. By comparison, SiO2 IO and TiO2 IO samples prepared by the same colloidal crystal templating method
(discussed briefly below) were hydrophilic and easily wetted by water.
This result suggests that the combination of inverse opal structure
(i.e., very spherical and regularly sized macropores) and the unique
physical properties of the very small ZrO2 crystallites
in the walls of the inverse opals was responsible for the unexpected
hydrophobicity displayed by the ZrO2 IO films.88−90

Returning to the data in Figure 6a,b, we noted the PBG positions for each
ZrO2 IO in air and each liquid, which were then used to
create plots
of PBG position versus solvent refractive index (Figure 7). The plots for all three
ZrO2 IO samples were remarkably linear (r2 > 0.999). This linearity can be understood by substituting
[ϕnsolid + (1 – ϕ)nvoid] for navg in eq 3, which leads to the following
equation 4  Here, nvoid represents
the refractive index of the medium (i.e., solvent) filling the void
space in the inverse opals. In agreement with experimental observations,
a plot of λmax versus nsolvent is predicted to be linear, with slope = 1.633D(1
– ϕ) and y-axis intercept = 1.633Dϕ nZrO2. Using
the slopes and intercepts of the straight lines in Figure 7, we calculated values of D and ϕZrO2 for the ZrO2 IO #1, ZrO2 IO #2, and ZrO2 IO #3 films
using the following expressions48,63 5   6  Using nZrO2 = 2.1, the D values obtained were 251, 284,
and 331 nm, respectively, and the ϕZrO2 values obtained were 0.158, 0.122, and 0.115, respectively, all
in excellent accord with the values determined for the same parameters
using other methods (Table 1). The very strong linearity of the plots in Figure 7 suggested the ZrO2 IO films could be used in refractive index sensing. To determine
the refractive index of an unknown liquid, all that would be required
is to determine the PBG position along the [111] direction using one
of the ZrO2 IO films. Once the PBG position was determined,
the refractive index of the unknown liquid could be extrapolated from
the plot in Figure 7 for that same ZrO2 IO or alternatively calculated directly
using the linear regression equation.

Figure 7 Plot of the PBG position (λmax) along the [111]
direction versus the refractive index (nsolvent) of the solvent filling the macropores in the ZrO2 inverse
opal thin films. For all samples, a strong linear relationship was
observed (r2 > 0.999), in agreement
with eq 4.

To test the sensitivity of the ZrO2 IO
films for refractive
index sensing, we collected UV–vis spectra for the different
films in acetone (n = 1.3587) and ethanol (n = 1.3614), which differ by only 0.0027 refractive index
units. For the ZrO2 IO #1 film, a PBG shift to longer wavelengths
of 1.2 nm was detected on going from acetone to ethanol, with a slightly
large shift of 1.4 nm found for the ZrO2 IO #2 film. Based
on this result, we thus estimate that the ZrO2 IO films
should be able to discern two liquids with a refractive index difference
as small as 0.0005.

3.4 Optical Properties of Gold
Nanoparticle-Decorated
ZrO2 Inverse Opal Films
Fascinated by the optical
properties of the bare ZrO2 inverse opal films, we decided
to explore this aspect further by decorating the films with gold (Au)
nanoparticles. Unlike bulk gold, which is yellow, gold nanoparticles
display a range of size-dependent colors due to localized surface
plasmon resonances (LSPRs).63,91,92 The LSPRs are a collective oscillation of valence electrons on the
surface of the gold nanoparticles induced by the electric field of
light at the resonance frequency. For spherical gold nanoparticles
of size <20 nm in water, the LSPR absorption maximum is typically
observed around 520 nm (i.e., the nanoparticles absorb light strongly
in the green part of the visible spectrum), and we see the other reflected
wavelengths (especially the red part of the visible spectrum). For
this reason, a vial of small spherical Au NPs in water will look red
to the human eye. Similarly, stained glass windows containing Au nanoparticles
appear red to the observer. We were particularly interested in decorating
the ZrO2 IO #2 film with gold nanoparticles since that
film has a PBG along the [111] direction at 526 nm where the gold
nanoparticles were expected to absorb. This offered the opportunity
to study two competing optical phenomena (selective diffraction and
reflection by the ZrO2 IO #2 film and strong absorption
at comparable wavelengths by the Au nanoparticles).

Figure 8 shows transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images for the
ZrO2 IO #2 film (Figure 8a,b) and the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film (Figure 8c,d). In both cases,
the films were scraped off the underlying glass substrate for imaging,
which did not adversely affect the ordered structure of the films.
The selected area diffraction pattern for the ZrO2 IO #2
film showed a characteristic ring structure, which supported the earlier
XRD findings that the films were composed of very small nanocrystalline
tetragonal ZrO2 crystallites (<5 nm). After decoration
with Au nanoparticles at a loading of 5 wt %, small Au nanoparticles
of size 5–8 nm could be discerned in the TEM images. The small
size and excellent dispersion of the Au nanoparticles over the ZrO2 IO support are consistent with the known strong metal–support
interaction between Au and ZrO2. The XRD pattern for the
5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film (Figure S8) confirmed the successful deposition of Au nanoparticles, with new
broad peaks characteristic for small Au crystals appearing (especially
apparent in the XRD pattern of the 18 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2
film, Figure S8). XPS data in Figure S9 also confirmed the successful deposition
of metallic Au nanoparticles, with the Au 4f signal intensities increasing
in proportion to the nominal Au loadings. As expected, the Zr 3d signals
were attenuated slightly as the Au loading increased. When illuminated
and viewed along the [111] direction, the Au/ZrO2 IO #2
film appeared green in air (Figure 8e). Thus, the photonic crystal was rejecting wavelengths
of light typically used by the Au nanoparticles for absorption (i.e.,
the PBG properties of the ZrO2 IO film appeared to dominate
the perceived color along the [111] direction; note: a noninverse
opal Au/ZrO2 specimen would certainly appear purple under
the same illumination conditions). On adding a drop of ethanol to
the film, the PBG for the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film was
red-shifted considerably and decoupled from the Au LSPR, resulting
in a brightly red-colored film (Figure 8f) whose color is the sum of both PBG diffraction and
Au LSPR absorption.

Figure 8 (a, b) TEM images for ZrO2 IO #2 and (c, d)
5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2. The images in (c) and (d) reveal
well-dispersed Au
nanoparticles of size around 5–7 nm; (e, f) shows digital photographs
of the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film in air and after wetting
with ethanol. The inset in (a) shows a selected area diffraction pattern
(scale bar = 0.2 Å–1). The well-developed ring
structure confirms the presence of small nanocrystals of tetragonal
ZrO2 (P42/nmc).

The LSPRs of Au nanoparticles
are known to be sensitive to the
refractive index of the surrounding medium91,92 and have been used previously to develop refractive index sensors
for liquids. The data in Figures 6 and 7 revealed that the ZrO2 IO films were extremely effective for refractive index sensing.
Accordingly, it was of novelty to see if the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film could be used to get a double determination of liquid
refractive index from a single UV–vis spectrum. Figure 9a shows UV–vis transmittance
spectra for the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film in air (n = 1.000), methanol (n = 1.329), ethanol
(n = 1.362), n-heptane (n = 1.388), dichloromethane (n = 1.424),
carbon tetrachloride (n = 1.460), and benzene (n = 1.501). In air, the ZrO2 IO #2 PBG along
the [111] direction and the Au LSPR absorption were almost perfectly
overlapped, giving a broad feature centered at 532 nm (i.e., responsible
for the green reflected color seen in Figure 8e). On immersion in the various organic solvents,
the Au LSPR and ZrO2 IO PBG decoupled, giving two distinct
features. The Au LSPR feature was centered between 545 and 556 nm,
and the ZrO2 IO #2 PBG centered between 663 and 754 nm.
In both cases, these features shifted linearly to longer wavelengths
on increasing the refractive index of the liquid the film was immersed
in (Figure 9b). Accordingly,
it can be concluded that the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 film
allows two parallel determinations of the refractive index of a liquid
from a single UV–visible transmittance spectrum measurement.
Using the slope and intercept of the PBG regression line in Figure 9b, values of D = 288.4 nm and ϕZrO2 = 0.11
were calculated using eqs 5 and 6, respectively (nZrO2 = 2.1 was assumed). These values are in good
agreement with data for bare ZrO2 IO #2 (D = 287 nm, ϕZrO2 = 0.15, Table 1), indicating that gold Au nanoparticle
deposition did not really alter the geometric properties of the ZrO2 IO film significantly.

Figure 9 (a) UV–vis transmittance spectra
collected along the [111]
direction for a 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 thin film in air (n = 1.000) and solvents of increasing refractive index (ranging
from methanol, n = 1.329, to benzene, n = 1.501). Both the PBG and the Au LSPR progressively red-shifted
linearly as the refractive index of the solvent in the film increased,
as shown in (b). The inset in (b) shows how the hydrophobicity of
the ZrO2 IO #2 film decreased after Au nanoparticle deposition
(top = before Au deposition; bottom = after Au deposition).

3.5 Catalytic
Activity of the Gold Nanoparticle-Decorated
ZrO2 Inverse Opal Films for 4-Nitrophenol Reduction
As a further demonstration of the functionality of the Au/ZrO2 IO #2 films fabricated in this study, we decided to evaluate
the catalytic activity of the as-prepared films, as well as films
decorated with Au nanoparticles at two different loadings (5 and 18
wt %), for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol using NaBH4 at
the reducing agent.93,94 In the presence of a large excess
of NaBH4, the kinetics of this reaction, which is catalyzed
by metal nanoparticles, obeys pseudo-first-order kinetics, as described
by the following integrated rate law 7  where At is the
absorbance of the 4-nitrophenol solution in water at 400 nm at time t, A0 is the initial absorbance
of the 4-nitrophenol solution in water at 400 nm (i.e., at t = 0 min), k′ is the pseudo-first-order
rate constant (units min–1), and t is the reaction time (in min). The reaction commences as soon as
the reducing agent (NaBH4) is added to the 4-nitrophenol
solution containing the catalyst. Figure 10a shows the UV–vis absorption spectra
for an aqueous solution containing 4-nitrophenol, NaBH4, and ZrO2 IO. A gradual decrease in the absorbance of
the 4-nitrophenol peak at 400 nm is seen over time (24 min), which
can largely be attributed to 4-nitrophenol adsorption on the ZrO2 IO surface (rather than catalytic reduction). The rate constant
of 0.026 min–1 was understandably low. After decoration
with Au nanoparticles, known active catalysts for 4-nitrophenol reduction
in the presence of NaBH4, the rate constant jumped dramatically
to k′ = 0.740 min–1 for
the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 sample and then to k′ = 1.927 min–1 for the 18 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 sample. The evolution of the main reaction product,
4-aminophenol, during the reaction is evident by the development of
the peak at 295 nm in the spectra. In the case of the 18 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 sample, the reaction proceeded so rapidly that it was
almost impossible to follow by UV–vis spectroscopy (reaching
completion in 2 min). The rates reported here accord well with the
best literature data for 4-nitrophenol reduction over the supported
gold catalysts.94−97 This high activity can be understood in terms of the open macroporous
structure of the ZrO2 IO support that allows facile transport
of reagents to the Au active sites. The high gold nanoparticle dispersion
realized in the Au/ZrO2 IO system (Figure 8c,d) is also advantageous in this context.
Supported Au nanoparticle catalysts offer many advantages over unsupported
Au nanoparticles in catalytic applications, especially the stabilization
afforded against nanoparticle aggregation. After storage for 1 year
at room temperature in closed vials, the 5 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 and 18 wt % Au/ZrO2 IO #2 catalysts demonstrated
identical performance as the freshly prepared catalysts for 4-nitrophenol
reduction.

3.6 Author
Commentary on the Versatility of Colloidal
Crystal Template Strategy
The data above demonstrates the
wonderful structural color palette that is available by fabricating
a single type of inverse opal film. By varying the diameter of the
PMMA colloids in the colloidal crystal templates, it is possible to
controllably modify the position of PBGs along the [111] direction
in the ZrO2 IO films. By rotating the samples with respect
to the source of illumination, the PBG along the [111] direction can
be shifted to shorter wavelengths, and by filling the macropores in
the inverse opals with liquids of different refractive indices, it
is possible to redshift the PBG over a large range of wavelengths.
Through systematic manipulation of all of these parameters in the
current study, we have been able to recreate, via structural engineering,
all of the vivid colors exhibited by the natural photonic crystal
specimens in Figure S1. Importantly, all
of the optical phenomena we have reported relating to the ZrO2 IO films are accurately captured by the modified Bragg’s
law expressions described in eqs 1–3. Further, by simply substituting
the Zr(IV) propoxide precursor with tetraethylorthosilicate or titanium
(IV) propoxide and changing the solvent from methanol to ethanol,
keeping all other fabrication procedures the same, amorphous SiO2 IO or nanocrystalline TiO2 IO films, respectively,
can readily be accessed (Figure S10). All
of the aformentioned aspects make colloidal crystal templating a fascinating
topic for advanced-level research as well as undergraduate teaching
laboratories. We encourage others to enter this research space.

4 Conclusions
ZrO2 inverse opal
thin films with striking angle-dependent
structural color at visible wavelengths were successfully fabricated
by the colloidal crystal template technique. The optical properties
of the films were dominated by first-order diffraction on fcc (111)
planes, with excellent accord established between the optical properties
of the films and predictions based on a modified Bragg’s law
expression. Refractive index sensing with a sensitivity estimated
around ∼0.0005 units was demonstrated using the ZrO2 inverse opal thin films, based on the progressive linear shift in
the PBG position along the [111] direction with increasing solvent
refractive index. Further, by functionalizing the ZrO2 IO
films with gold nanoparticles, a novel refractive index sensing platform
was created that allowed parallel determinations of liquid refractive
index (one strategy used the small shift in the Au LSPR position,
and the other utilized the large shift in the PBG position as the
refractive index of the solvent in the Au/ZrO2 IO films
increased). Due to their inherent macroporosity, ZrO2 IOs
represent near-ideal supports for noble metal catalysts, which we
confirmed through the successful application of Au/ZrO2 IO films to the reduction of aqueous 4-nitrophenol in the presence
of NaBH4. Results of this study are expected to encourage
others to utilize the colloidal crystal template approach to fabricate
novel photonic crystal thin films for sensing and catalytic applications.
