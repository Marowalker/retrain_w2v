The
present study deals with the synthesis of SrTiO3 (STO)
nanocatalysts by conventional oxalate and microwave-assisted
hydrothermal methods. Thorough characterization of the nanocatalysts
synthesized has been done by using various techniques such as X-ray
diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, N2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy, total acidity
by pyridine adsorption method, and acidic strength by n-butylamine potentiometric titration, respectively. Structural parameters
were estimated by Rietveld refinement analysis from XRD data which
confirms cubic structure of SrTiO3. Traces of impurities
such as TiO2 and SrCO3 were found in conventional
catalysts, whereas these are absent in microwave catalyst. Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the microwave catalyst was enhanced 14-folds
compared to conventional catalyst. Increase in Lewis acid sites and
their strength were also observed in STO microwave catalyst. Catalytic
performance of the catalysts was evaluated for various reactions,
such as Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde, catalytic transfer
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene, and amination of benzaldehyde. Catalytic
results reveal that microwave-synthesized catalyst showed 100% conversion
and selectivity (>99% yield) for the chosen reactions than the
conventional
catalyst. Excellent catalytic activity of the STO microwave catalyst
was due to high BET surface area, pore volume, and acidity of the
catalyst, as compared to conventional catalyst. The present study
marks the first-time application of perovskite-based SrTiO3 as a potential multitasking cost-effective catalyst for the above
reactions and synthesized using environment friendly microwave synthesis
method.

==== Body
Introduction
The escalating demand for environmental
friendly products and process
leads to the development of nanocatalysts that provide high selectivity
and activity in various chemical reactions.1−3 Multitask catalysts
are catalysts which could be able to catalyze at least two consecutive
reactions.4 However, retention of their
selectivity and reusability after several reaction cycles is very
challenging.5 During the past few years,
various catalysts have been exploited for diverse chemical reactions
such as Lewis acids,6 amine-functionalized
solid supports,7 ionic liquids,8 zeolites,9,10 and metal organic frameworks.5,11 However, these catalysts offer several disadvantages such as utilization
of hazardous and carcinogenic solvents, large amount of catalysts,
long reaction time, nonrecoverable catalysts, and generation of secondary
products that hindered their large-scale industrial application.12,13 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop efficient recoverable
solid-phase catalyst that can overcome these problems and show high
activity as well as maximum reusability. Hence, in the present study,
we have explored an alternate perovskite as a catalyst for three different
types of catalytic reactions.

Structure of perovskites and their
physical and chemical properties
were discussed in our previous publication.14 Among various perovskites, much attention has been paid to SrTiO3 because of its structural, electrical, optical, and catalytic
properties, which can be tailored for practical applications. Many
methods have been reported for synthesizing titanates such as coprecipitation,15 solid-state reaction,18 liquid–solid reaction method,16 molten salt synthesis,17 sol–gel,18 and hydrothermal method.19 Recently, we have explored oxalate route20 and microwave-assisted hydrothermal (MH) method for the
synthesis of BaTiO3 and Cr-doped BaTiO3 nanocatalysts.14 The present work is in continuation of this
previous work to identify the most active catalyst than microwave-synthesized
BaTiO3, and its applicability for multitasking in various
reactions has been explored.

Microwave chemistry is emerging
as a viable alternative green chemistry
and provides a more sustainable method for the synthesis of nanomaterials
in the future. It has been considered green because the environmental-friendly
solvents (e.g., water and ionic liquids) have often been applied in
combination with microwave heating method. On the other hand, conventional
oxalate (CO) route offers advantages in terms of better structural
composition and ease of the process. However, microwave heating has
several advantages in comparison with conventional synthesis methods
such as less synthesis time, and limited use of solvents makes the
process clean; require less temperature for synthesis, uniform heating,
high heating rate, phase purity of products, less expensive, and high-energy
efficiency.10 Whereas conventional synthesis
method requires extended period of time and consumes lot of energy.
From an industrial point of view, such synthesis method is not environmentally
and economically viable.

Knoevenagel condensation of aldehydes
is widely used to synthesize
α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds which were used as
intermediates or end products in pharmaceuticals, perfumes, polymers,
and agrochemical industries.21,22 Several catalysts such
as organic bases, Lewis acids, ionic liquids, metal–organic
frameworks, and so forth, have been used for Knoevenagel condensation
reaction.23−26 The reduction of nitro compounds to the corresponding amines is
very important as nitroarenes and their derivatives cause pollution,
and these are mainly formed during the production of synthetic dyes,
pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides.27 Amination of aromatic aldehydes is one of the important route for
the synthesis of imines and their derivatives which are important
organic intermediates in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals.28 In the literature, several methods described
the synthesis of imines.28−30 However, most of the catalysts
used for these reactions have disadvantages such as not being environmentally
friendly, excess starting materials, scarcity of the metals, formation
of unavoidable byproducts, and most importantly narrow substrates
scope.

In the current article, we have employed SrTiO3 nanocatalyst
as the green catalyst for Knoevenagel condensation, catalytic transfer
hydrogenation, and amination reactions. The catalysts were synthesized
via microwave hydrothermal method and CO methods, and the effect of
synthesis method on the catalytic activity of the catalysts has been
investigated. The nanocatalysts synthesized were characterized by
various advanced analytical techniques. Further, SrTiO3 was used for the first time for a variety of reactions and recyclability
of the same in the chosen reactions.

Characterization Techniques
The nanocatalysts that
are synthesized were thoroughly characterized by using the following
techniques and their details are as follows: powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD) using PAN analytical X’pert PRO Powder Diffractometer
with Cu Kα (λ = 1.5418 Å) as the radiation source.

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured in the
wavenumber range of 4000–350 cm–1 at ambient
temperature by PerkinElmer FTIR-300 spectrometer using KBr pellet
method.

The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area measurements
were performed using Quantachrome Autosorb iQ2 automated
gas sorption analyzer. Samples are pretreated in N2 at
300 °C for 4 h, before adsorbing N2 at liquid nitrogen
temperature (−196 °C), and the BET surface area and pore
volume of the catalysts were obtained by N2 adsorption
and desorption isotherms. The particle size and morphology were studied
using a transmission electron microscope (Model JEM-2010, JEOL, Tokyo,
Japan).

Acidic strength of the catalyst powders was determined
by n-butylamine potentiometric titration method.
About 0.5
g of the solid was stirred in acetonitrile for 3 h, and the contents
were titrated with a solution of 0.01 N n-butylamine
in acetonitrile at a flow rate of 0.02 mL/min; the variation in the
electrode potential was measured with a potentiometric titrator using
a standard calomel electrode. This method allows the determination
of the total number of acidic sites and their strength. For interpretation
of the results, the initial electrode potential (Ei) is taken as the maximum acidic strength of the surface
sites and the range, where the plateau reached (mequiv/g) is considered
as the total number of acid sites.31 The
acidic strength of the surface sites can be assigned according to
the following ranges very strong site Ei > 100 mV; strong site 0 < Ei <
100 mV; weak site −100 < Ei <
0 mV; very weak site Ei < −100
mV.

Total acidity was determined using pyridine adsorption method,
and the changes were recorded by FT-IR spectroscopy. Prior to pyridine,
adsorption samples were degassed at 120 °C for 1 h and then saturated
with pyridine and then evacuated at 115 °C for 30 min to remove
any physisorbed pyridine. FT-IR spectra of the samples were then recorded
in the wavenumber range of 1200–1800 cm–1.

Catalytic Activity
The knoevenagel condensation reaction
of benzaldehyde with ethyl cyanoacetate to form ethyl trans-α-cyanocinnamate was carried out by taking 20 mmol of benzaldehyde
and 20 mmol of ethyl cyanoacetate and 10 mL of water as a solvent
in a 100 mL round-bottom flask. Then, 120 mg of catalyst was added
to the reaction mixture and stirred under reflux conditions at 80
°C for 30 min in a silicon oil bath.

Catalytic reduction
of nitrobenzene to aniline was carried out using hydrazine hydrate
as hydrogen donor in a two-necked 100 ml round-bottom flask fitted
with a reflux condenser. In a typical run, 80 mg of the catalyst was
placed in a solution containing 10 mmol of nitrobenzene, 10 mmol of
KOH pellets, 1.5 mL of hydrazine hydrate, and 10 mL of 2-propanol.
The mixture was continuously stirred and refluxed at 80 °C for
2–6 h in an oil bath.

Catalytic amination was conducted
under continuous stirring in
a two-necked 50 mL round-bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser.
The catalyst (120 mg) was dispersed in a solution containing 2 mmol
of benzaldehyde and 2 mmol of aniline in 2 mL of toluene, and the
contents of the flask were stirred and refluxed at 110 °C for
24 h in an oil bath. The analysis of the above three reaction samples
was done by withdrawing definite aliquots of the reaction sample at
regular intervals and analyzed them using GC-MS (Thermo Trace GC Ultra
(GC), Thermo DSQ II (MS); with DB5 MS column of 30 mL × 0.25
mm ID × 0.25 μm film thickness and with electron multiplier
detector).

Recycling of Catalysts
Catalysts
were recycled after
every catalytic reaction. The catalyst was separated by centrifugation,
washed with ethanol, and dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight
before using it in the next reaction.

Results and Discussion
Powder
XRD
The diffraction patterns of STO nanocatalysts
synthesized by both conventional (STO_C) and microwave (STO_M) methods
are shown in Figure 1. XRD patterns were indexed to SrTiO3 cubic perovskite
structure with Pm3̅m (no.
221) space group (JCPDS card no. 073-0661) in both STO_C and STO_M
catalysts. Secondary phases corresponding to TiO2 and SrCO3 are present in STO_C, whereas in STO_M, pure phase has been
observed without any traces of impurities. This study reveals that
a single pure phase should be obtained using the MH method. Further,
the peak broadening was observed in STO_M, which is the characteristic
feature of the small crystallite size compared to STO_C.

Figure 1 Powder XRD
patterns of STO nanocatalysts synthesized by the conventional
and microwave methods.

Average crystallite size (D) of the catalysts
was determined using Scherrer equation as follows 1  where λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.5418
Å), β is the full width at half maximum, and θ is
the Bragg angle. The average crystallite size evaluated from XRD patterns
was found to be 63.5 and 37.4 nm for STO_C and STO_M, respectively.
The average crystallite size of STO_M was found to be less and half
the crystallite size of STO_C. This was due to microwave heating as
it was reported that during microwave heating, the dipole change of
the polar molecules takes place which leads to molecular agitation
and friction and results in smaller particle size.32

Rietveld Refinement Analysis
Rietveld
refinement was
performed using powder XRD data to obtain the structural information.
The parameters that are refined are scale factor, background, profile
half-width parameters (u, v, and w), preferred orientation, isotropic displacement parameters,
lattice parameters, isothermal temperature factors (Biso), and atomic functional positions. Figure 2 illustrates the observed,
calculated, and the difference in XRD patterns of STO nanocatalysts.
Rietveld refinement analysis reveals that STO_C and STO_M have cubic
SrTiO3 phase.

Figure 2 Observed, calculated, and the difference XRD
patterns of (a) STO_C
and (b) STO_M.

The results obtained
by the Rietveld refinement analysis showed
good correlation between the observed/experimental XRD patterns and
the calculated XRD patterns. However, small differences were found
between the observed values (Yobs) and
calculated values (Ycalc) on the intensity
scale near zero, as illustrated by the (Yobs – Ycalc) line. The XRD data structure
refinement of STO nanocatalysts are shown in Table 1. The values of fit parameters, χ2 reveals the goodness-of-fit of refinement parameters, Rwp suggests the success of the refinement, and RBragg is the crystallographic model that was
used to fit the experimental data, suggesting that the refinement
results are very reliable. Further, it was observed that the STO_M
catalyst has χ2 less than STO_C, which confirms the
phase purity in STO_M.

FTIR Spectroscopy
The FTIR spectra of the STO nanocatalysts
measured at room temperature from 360 to 4000 cm–1 are shown in Figure 3a. The less intense band observed between 370 and 430 cm–1 in both of the catalysts was due to the TiOII bending
vibrations, and the absorption band in the range of about 500–800
cm–1 corresponds to the vibrations of Ti–O
bond within the TiOVI group.20

Determination of Total Acidity and Acidic Strength of the Catalysts
Total acidity of the catalysts was determined by pyridine adsorption
method by using FT-IR spectroscopy, and the corresponding FT-IR spectra
of the STO_C and STO_M catalysts are presented in Figure 3b, and the results are given
in Table 2. The two
bands that appeared at 1433 and 1635 cm–1 in the
FTIR spectra of the catalysts were assigned to pyridine chemisorbed
to Lewis acid sites on the surface. In addition, the amount of Lewis
acidity for STO_C (Table 2) was found to be 356 μmol/g and for STO_M, it was found
to be 363 μmol/g. The acidity results reveal that there is an
increase in the number of Lewis acid sites in the catalyst synthesized
by MH method compared to the CO method.

STO_C	208	356	
STO_M	241	363	
Acidic strength obtained
by n-butylamine titration
method is expressed as E (mV) and is given in Table 2. It was observed
that Ei values of both of the catalysts
were greater than 100 mV, which indicates the presence of strong or
very strong acid sites in the catalysts, and the acidic strength of
the STO_M catalysts was higher than that of STO_C catalyst. This clearly
indicates that microwave heating of the catalysts also enhanced the
strength of acid sites.

BET Surface Area Analysis
As it
was known that catalytic
activity is strongly influenced by the surface properties, the same
has been determined for the synthesized nanocatalysts by N2 physisorption, and adsorption–desorption isotherms are shown
in Figure 4. It was
observed that both STO_M and STO_C showed a type IV isotherm which
is a characteristic of mesoporous materials along with H3 type H3
hysteresis loop in the range of 0.7–0.9 P/P0. STO_M catalyst showed a sharp increase in
the N2 adsorption step at a higher P/P0 value (∼0.7) with a large hysteresis
loop compared to STO_C catalyst. Type H3 hysteresis loop indicates
the presence of aggregates of particles giving rise to slit-shaped
pores.33 The specific surface area, pore
volume, and pore diameter of the synthesized nanocatalysts are summarized
in Table 3, and it
was observed that BET surface area of the STO_M has 14 times high
surface area compared to that of STO_C catalyst. The pore volume and
pore diameter of the nanocatalysts also increased significantly in
the STO_M nanocatalyst. The pore size of the synthesized nanocatalysts
is greater than 2 nm, and it confirms the presence of mesopores in
the catalysts.

Transmission Electron Microscopic
Studies
Morphology
and particle size of the catalysts were studied using transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), and the images are displayed in Figure 5. It was observed
that STO_C contains large cubic particles and are highly agglomerated
having an average particle size of 102 nm (Table 3). Whereas STO_M showed uniformly dispersed
small spherical particles with an average particle size of 21.4 nm,
which was much less compared to STO_C catalyst. Small particle size
of the microwave catalyst was due to cavitation effect of microwave
heating that has been discussed
thoroughly in our previous paper.14 The
decrease in particle size of the catalysts is in agreement with the
XRD crystallite size (Table 3).

Figure 6 illustrates
the high-resolution TEM images of the STO_M catalysts. Clear lattice
fringes are observed, and the interlayer spacing calculated is 0.276
nm, as shown in Figure 6 (top) corresponding to the (110) crystal plane spacing of cubic
SrTiO3 (JCPDS card no. 073-0661, d110 = 0.276 nm). Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra of STO_M
catalysts are shown in Figure 6 (bottom). EDX analysis reveals the presence of Sr, Ti, and
O in STO_M catalysts.

Catalytic Activity Studies
Catalytic performance of
the STO_M and STO_C catalysts has been evaluated for various reactions
which are discussed in detail below. We have performed blank reactions
for all of the three reactions and observed no reactivity in the absence
of catalyst.

Knoevenagel Condensation
Catalytic
activity of the
synthesized catalysts was evaluated for Knoevenagel condensation reaction
using benzaldehyde and ethylcyanoacetate as reactants with ethyl α-cyanocinnamate
yielded as the major product. All of the products are identified using
GC-MS. The catalytic activities of the STO catalysts synthesized by
CO and MH methods are compared and is shown in Table 4. Both STO catalysts showed 100% conversion
as well as 100% selectivity toward the formation of ethyl α-cyanocinnamate.
In particular, STO_M catalyst showed conversion (100%) in less time
within 15 min. This was due to improved physical properties such as
surface area, pore diameter, and pore volume of STO_M catalysts (see Table 3) because of microwave
heating. Because the rate of condensation of benzaldehyde and ethyl
cyanoacetate was faster on STO_M, the study was extended further with
this catalyst on another active methylene compound, malononitrile
(Scheme 1). The STO_M
catalyst was also found to be highly effective for benzaldehyde condensation
with malononitrile and resulted in 100% yield of the product within
30 min reaction time (Table 5, entry 8). Good yields with ethyl cyanoacetate and malononitrile
in short time could be because of presence of the electron-withdrawing
group, which facilitates easy release of protons from active methylene
groups and stabilizes the negative charge through resonance (enolate
formation).34 The effect of the substitution
in the benzaldehyde was studied with both ethylcyanoacetate and malononitrile
with similar reaction conditions (Table 5). All of the substituted benzaldehyde compounds
having electron-withdrawing as well as electron-donating groups have
shown remarkable good yields for ethyl cyanoacetate and, in the case
of malononitrile, all substituted benzaldehyde compounds showed less
conversions (55–72%) in 3–6 h (Table 5, entry 9–13). This could be because
of the decrease in the electrophilicity on the active center of the
benzaldehyde.35Table 6 shows the comparison of the catalytic activity
of STO_M catalyst with other catalysts that are reported in the literature
for Knoevenagel condensation of benzaldehyde with active methylene
compounds. These studies reveal that STO_M catalyst in the present
study has showed 100% conversion and selectivity for condensation
of benzaldehyde with ethylcyanoacetate and malononitrile in less than
30 min compared to the reported systems. Moreover, STO is inexpensive
and economical compared to most of the catalysts given in Table 6.

Catalytic Transfer Hydrogenation
We have also investigated
the catalytic performance of the catalysts for catalytic transfer
hydrogenation of nitrobenzene to aniline in the presence of hydrazine
hydrate as the hydrogen donor. Scheme 2 depicts a typical catalytic transfer hydrogenation
of nitroarenes to the corresponding amines. In this reaction, aniline
was yielded as the major product. Table 4 shows the catalytic activity of the catalysts.
Compared with STO_C catalyst, STO_M catalyst showed 100% nitrobenzene
conversion with 100% aniline selectivity. Furthermore, catalytic activity
of STO_M for substituted nitrobenzene substrates has been studied
under similar reaction conditions (Table 7). It was observed that para-substituted
compounds gave very good yields, whereas for ortho-substituted compounds’
yields are very less, which could be attributed to steric hindrance
(Table 7, entry 2,
5, 7). Table 8 shows
the comparison of catalytic activity of STO_M catalyst with the reported
systems in literature for catalytic transfer hydrogenation of nitrobenzene
to aniline. Our catalyst performance is comparable with most of the
reported catalysts including our previous studies.14 The only difference observed is that few reported catalytic
systems are highly expensive, and scarcity of these metals makes the
process costly compared to our green, economical, and multitasking
STO catalyst.

Amination of Benzaldehyde
The catalytic activity of
the synthesized catalysts toward amination of benzaldehyde is also
discussed here. Scheme 3 depicts a typical amination of benzaldehyde using aniline on synthesized
catalysts. In this reaction, Schiff bases yielded as the major product.
Compared with STO_C catalyst, the STO_M catalyst showed 100% conversion
with 99.6% selectivity toward the formation of a Schiff base (Table 4). The effect of the
substitution at para, meta, and ortho positions of benzaldehyde on
amination reaction was studied with STO_M catalyst under similar reaction
conditions (Table 9). Interestingly, substituted benzaldehydes did not affect the yield
of Schiff bases much. Table 10 shows the comparison of catalytic activity of STO_M catalyst
with the reported catalysts in literature for amination of benzaldehyde
with aniline. Our catalyst has showed 100% yield, whereas the reported
catalysts showed less yields at variable reaction conditions. In the
present study, we have revealed STO_M catalyst as one of the prominent
multitasking catalyst, by its application for Knoevenagel condensation,
catalytic transfer hydrogenation, and amination reactions.

for testing the recyclability capability for the above three reactions
because this catalyst showed superior catalytic performance compared
to STO_C. It was found that it could be reused without significant
loss in the catalytic activity up to three reaction cycles.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have synthesized pure SrTiO3 nanocatalyst
by using microwave hydrothermal method, which exhibits good textural
and surface properties compared to conventionally synthesized catalyst
and has proven highly efficient for the synthesis of amines, imines,
and α, β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds via catalytic
transfer hydrogenation, amination, and Knoevenagel condensation reactions.
Rietveld analysis of the XRD data confirmed SrTiO3 crystallize
in cubic structure. Traces of carbonate and TiO2 impurities
are present in the XRD of conventional catalyst, whereas pure phase
without any impurities was obtained in microwave-synthesized catalyst.
Average particle size of the microwave catalyst determined from TEM
image was found to be 21.4 which is much less compared to conventional
catalyst particle size of 102 nm. Both the conventional and microwave-synthesized
SrTiO3 catalysts showed good reactivity for all of the
three reactions chosen in the present study. However, excellent catalytic
performance of the microwave SrTiO3 catalyst was due to
the high surface area, Lewis acidity, and high acidic strength of
the catalyst compared to a conventional one. Almost 100% conversion
with >99.6% selectivity has been observed on microwave SrTiO3 catalyst in all of the reactions, where it has been applied
except
in few cases of substituted substrates. In short, synthesis of SrTiO3 catalyst in pure form by microwave-hydrothermal method containing
excellent catalytic properties is achieved at low synthesis temperature
and in less time makes the process green, energy efficient, and environmentally
friendly compared to its counter high-temperature conventional catalyst.
The present study also marks the first-time application of SrTiO3 as an efficient multitask catalyst, which can be used potentially
as a cost-effective industrial catalyst.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of SrTiO3 Nanocatalysts
CO Method
SrTiO3 nanoparticles were synthesized
using titanium isopropoxide (Ti (OC3H7)4), strontium nitrate (Sr (NO3)2) as
precursors, oxalic acid (C2H2O4·2H2O) as a chelating agent, and 2-propanol (C3H7OH) as the solvent. The molar composition of the precursors
are as follows: Sr (NO3)2/Ti (OC3H7)4/C2H2O4·2H2O = 1:1:2. Aqueous solutions of strontium nitrate
and oxalic acid are added to titanium isopropoxide solution separately
dissolved in 50 mL of 2-propanol and water, and the mixture solution
was stirred at 60 °C for 1 h and the homogenous solution thus
obtained was evaporated to dryness at 100 °C. The solid precursor
thus obtained was dried at 120 °C overnight in the oven, and
the dried sample was ground to a fine powder and calcined at 900 °C
for 12 h in a static air furnace.

MH Method
SrCl2·2H2O and
titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) were chosen as starting
materials for the synthesis of SrTiO3. In a typical synthesis
of SrTiO3, TiCl4 was added to the distilled
water at 0 °C to this aqueous solution of SrCl2. 2H2O was added and stirred for some time and KOH was added while
stirring and a homogenous solution was obtained. The molar ratio of
the precursors maintained at TiCl4/SrCl2·2H2O/KOH/H2O is 1:2:30:300. The homogenous solution
thus obtained was transferred to Teflon-lined autoclave and placed
the same in the microwave instrument at 180 °C and treated for
30 min (Model: MW 5000, SINEO, maximum power of 1500 W). The autoclave
thus cooled to room temperature after treatment, and the solid product
obtained was washed with 0.1 M aqueous acetic acid solution and deionized
water. The solid product was recovered by centrifugation and dried
at 105 °C overnight.
