We
propose a new superhydrophobic surface that contains a carbon
nanotube (CNT)-implanted poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/adhesive multilayer.
The adhesive provides very strong adhesion between the CNT-implanted
PDMS layer and the substrate, and the CNTs on the surface exhibit
superhydrophobicity. Therefore, the CNT-implanted PDMS/adhesive (CIPA)
layer provides a highly reliable surface for superhydrophobicity.
The fabricated CIPA surface performs far better than previously reported
surfaces in terms of stability tests, such as contamination and solvent
tests, and physical contact, including thermal pressure, bending,
adhesion, and water jet tests. If a portion of the CIPA surface is
destroyed, the surface is immediately restored because the material
can regenerate the surface to its initial state. The surface can therefore
maintain its superhydrophobicity even when damaged in rough environments,
without self-healing or additional repair. Furthermore, because the
adhesive is sprayed and coated on the surface of the substrate, a
CIPA surface can be formed on three-dimensional shapes, including
curved surfaces, and on various substrates.

1 Introduction
Because Neinhuis and Barthlott
discovered the secret of the superhydrophobicity
of the lotus leaf,1 the implementation
of artificial superhydrophobic surfaces has been recognized as one
of the most successful cases in biomimetics.2−7 In the past, researchers simply attempted to imitate the lotus leaf,8 whereas in recent years, artificial superhydrophobic
surfaces have been applied to commercial products, such as solar cell
panels,9,10 glasses,11,12 paints,13 and oil/water separation.14−16 A superhydrophobic
surface is a surface that has a water contact angle of 150° or
larger and a water sliding angle of 10° or smaller.17,18 In general, two main technologies must be integrated to obtain an
artificial superhydrophobic surface: nanoscale or microscale papillae
should be formed on the surface of the substrate and a thin hydrophobic
film must coat the entire surface, including the papillae. To date,
the largest contact angle obtained from a hydrophobic solution coating
without papillae on the surface is 120°.14 With the presence of nanoscale/microscale papillae, the contact
area between a sample surface and water droplets decreases, reducing
the surface energy. The papillae structure is therefore the core component
in the fabrication of a superhydrophobic surface. However, because
these nano-/micropapillae bulge on the surface, they can be easily
damaged by physical contact.19−21

Superhydrophobic surfaces
have mostly been applied to surfaces
for which physical contact is not significant, such as paint for structures
and solar cell panels. Recently, however, they have been utilized
in areas that do receive significant physical contact, such as paint
for automobiles and clothes. It is thus important to be able to maintain
superhydrophobicity by preventing damage caused by physical contact.
When superhydrophobic surfaces are used on automobiles and clothing,
they are likely to be exposed to frequent physical contact and strong
hydraulic water pressure along with detergent during cleaning. Because
of such unfavorable conditions, a highly reliable superhydrophobic
surface structure that is physically robust and chemically stable
must be developed to prevent the hydrophobic coating layer from peeling
off and to keep the nano-/microstructures on the surface.

There
have been many attempts to implement highly reliable superhydrophobic
surfaces, including the use of hierarchical micro–nanostructures22−24 and repairable or self-healing surfaces. In the hierarchical method,
if physical contact occurs, a microstructure that is a relatively
large structure protects nanostructures, thereby maintaining superhydrophobicity25−27 In the repairable fabrication method, a nanomaterial is sprayed
onto the surface. This method can restore superhydrophobicity to the
surface by spraying the nanomaterial on the defects caused by physical
contact.28,29 Finally, in the self-healing method, when
the surface is damaged, either hydrophobic components rapidly move
to the destroyed area to restore the surface or the hydrophobic colloid
spontaneously self-organizes to maintain superhydrophobicity.30−32

In the hierarchical method, if the microstructure is broken
or
the surface is damaged by external contact, the surface loses superhydrophobicity.
In the repairable method, because the damaged area must be reworked
to restore the surface, the initially fabricated surface is not highly
reliable. This method thus requires continuous reworking, and the
surface may not be able to be restored if it is liquefied by chemicals
such as solvents. The self-healing method also requires reworking
the damaged area and therefore cannot produce a highly reliable initial
surface either. Moreover, because it takes time to restore the damaged
initial surface, the self-heating method cannot maintain a superhydrophobic
surface well. This problem can be solved by manufacturing a durable
superhydrophobic surface from the beginning so that it will not be
damaged by physical or chemical contact. Many studies on manufacturing
durable superhydrophobic surfaces have been performed.33,34 However, for the durable superhydrophobic structure, only poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) or plastic-type materials that already have hydrophobicity
can be used. As a result, it cannot be applied to various surfaces.
To overcome the aforementioned weaknesses of superhydrophobic surfaces,
stronger and more reliable papillae can be fabricated that are robust
to physical contact and not destroyed by solvents. To endure physical
contact, the papillae must be very strong and strongly attached to
the surface. Furthermore, the thin hydrophobic layer of the surface
should not peel off easily.

Herein, we propose a new highly
reliable superhydrophobic surface
on which carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are strongly fixed on a PDMS/adhesive
multilayer. Because of their strength and flexibility, CNTs are not
easily damaged by physical contact and do not react with solvents.
The strength of the adhesive between the substrate and CNT-implanted
PDMS layer ensures that the attached layer cannot be easily detached
from the surface of the substrate. Furthermore, because PDMS is hydrophobic
and less reactive to organic solvents, it is suitable for maintaining
a physically and chemically robust superhydrophobic surface. Because
both CNTs and PDMS, the exposed materials, are hydrophobic, there
is no need for additional hydrophobic coatings. When partial scratching
and peeling of the top surface occur, a new water-repellent surface
is revealed. This is consequently a suitable structure for maintaining
superhydrophobicity. The physical stability of the prepared CNT-implanted
PDMS/adhesive (CIPA) surface is evaluated by heat, pressure, hydraulic-pressure,
and bending tests, and the chemical stability is evaluated by organic-solvent
stability and cleaning ability tests. Tape tests reveal that the superhydrophobic
CIPA surface is very robust to damage caused by adhesive materials.
Finally, it is shown that the proposed CIPA surface can be applied
to various substrates, such as metals, glasses, fibers, and polymers.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 Materials and Methods
The CIPA surface
was composed of multiwall CNTs (MWCNTs, CM-250, Hanhwa Nanotech Corp.,
Korea), a Sylgard 184 PDMS prepolymer base (part A), a cross-linking
curing agent (part B) (Dow Corning), and a spray adhesive (Super 99,
3M). The wet etching of PDMS was performed at room temperature under
continuous stirring at a rotational speed of 500 rpm in a solution
of N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) (Alfa Aesar) and
tetra-butyl ammonium fluoride (TBAF) (75 wt % in H2O, Alfa
Aesar). The ratio of NMP to TBAF/water was 3:1. To evaluate the stability
of the organic solvents, acetone (99.98%, OCI Co., Korea), ethanol
(99.98%, OCI Co., Korea), and isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (99.98%, OCI
Co., Korea) were used. In addition, diesel (SK energy, Korea), vegetable
oil (Beksul, Korea), and crude oil (SOKOL, SGS, Russia) were used
to evaluate their stability to contamination. Doubly distilled and
deionized (DI) water with a specific resistance over 18 MΩ·cm
was used throughout the study.

A scanning electron microscope
(SEM, S-4800, Hitachi, Japan) was used to analyze the surface morphology.
The water contact angle was measured using a contact-angle meter (SEO,
Korea), and the water sliding angle was measured using a tilting microscope
(BXFM, Olympus, Japan). DI water was used to measure the contact and
sliding angles. The size of droplet used in these measurements was
4 μL. Three specimens were measured five times to determine
the contact and sliding angles. We examined the physical properties
of the CIPA surface by conducting heat, pressure, water jet, bending,
and adhesion tests and examined the chemical properties by evaluating
its stability to an organic solvent and contamination. For bending
tests to determine sufficient flexibility, a CIPA layer was formed
on the surface of cellulose-/polyester-based nonwoven fabrics (ww2109,
KM, Korea). For other tests, a CIPA layer was formed on the surface
of a copper sheet (99.9%, Kojundo, Japan).

2.2 Preparation
of the CIPA Surface
Figure 1 shows the manufacturing
process of the CIPA surface. First, a CNT-dispersed PDMS (CNT + PDMS)
sheet was fabricated, as shown in Figure 1a. The PDMS precursor was prepared by mixing
the PDMS prepolymer and the cross-linking agent at a ratio of 10:1
(w/w). CNTs of 5 wt % were then mixed with the PDMS precursor and
degassed to remove air bubbles from the mixture under a vacuum condition
(5 × 10–6 Torr) for 1 h. The CNT + PDMS mixture
was filled in two plates 3 mm apart and was cured on a hot plate at
90 °C for 3 h. The surfaces of the fabricated CNT + PDMS sheet
were etched in a PDMS wet etching solution at room temperature for
700 s and washed with DI water. Etching of the PDMS skin of the CNT
+ PDMS sheet exposed the CNTs, as shown in Figure 1a.

CIPA surface. While some parts of the CNTs extrude from the PDMS surface,
the other parts are implanted into the PDMS/adhesive multilayer. A
water droplet is fully lifted because of the CNTs exposed on the surface.

After the adhesive was thoroughly
sprayed onto the surface of the
substrate (Figure 1b), the PDMS sheet adhered to the surface of the substrate under
9.8 kPa pressure (Figure 1c). When a force was applied to detach the PDMS sheet from
the substrate, a crack appeared on the side of the CNT + PDMS sheet
(Figure 1d). After
continuing to apply the force, the crack opened and the CNT + PDMS
sheet was detached from the substrate (Figure 1e). As shown in Figure 1e, the CNTs were fixed to the PDMS and adhesive
layers and some of the fixed parts of the CNTs were exposed outside
of the PDMS surface. That is, the CIPA surface was covered with CNTs
that were exposed outside of the PDMS surface.

2.3 Test
Methods for Performance Evaluation of
the Fabricated CIPA Surfaces
2.3.1 Stability Test Against
Heat and Pressure
To test the stability of the CIPA surface
against heat, a CIPA-coated
specimen was placed on top of a copper plate and heated from 50 to
300 °C in increments of 50 °C. The specimen was heated for
1 h using a hot plate (MSH-20D, Wised, Korea). To compare the thermal
stability of the CIPA surface to that of a PDMS sheet, a pure PDMS
sheet was manufactured and heated in the same way as the CIPA-coated
specimen. After the heater was turned off, the specimens were left
at room temperature for 60 min before their contact and sliding angles
were measured. For the compression test, pressures of 0–10
000 kPa in 200 kPa increments were applied to the specimens. Compression
was applied using a universal testing machine (ADMET) for 1 h. The
contact and sliding angles of the specimens were measured 60 min after
the compression had stopped.

2.3.2 Bending
and Adhesion Tests
The
bending test was performed by folding the specimen with two fingers
in one direction and then folding it again in the opposite direction,
which was defined as one cycle. In this test, the two sides folded
inward were completely attached. Such bending creates very large tensile
and compression stresses on the folded part of the CIPA surface. After
100 bending cycles, the contact angle was measured and surface damage
was assessed using SEM. To test the adhesion of the CNTs to the CIPA
layer and the bonding strength of the CIPA layer to the substrate,
an adhesion test was conducted using scotch tape (Crystal Clear Tape,
3M). The tape was placed on the specimen, and then a force of 100
gf was applied for 10 min to the surface, after which the tape was
peeled off. After repeating the tape bonding and peeling up to 20
times, the contact angle was measured, and the degree of detachment
of the CNTs was assessed using SEM.

2.3.3 Water
Jet Test
Water jet testing
was conducted to examine the resistance of the CIPA surface to a high-pressure
water spray. Water pressures ranging from 0 to 500 kPa were applied
in 100 kPa increments. The nozzle and specimen were placed perpendicular
to each other, 5 cm apart. The inner diameter and length of the nozzle
were 5 and 10 mm, respectively. The water pressure was measured using
a pressure sensor immediately before the pumped water escaped through
the nozzle. The water jet was sprayed continuously for 10 min.

2.3.4 Stability Test for Organic Solvents and
Contamination
To evaluate the stability to organic solvents,
three types of solvents were used: acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl
alcohol. Prepared specimens were placed in each organic solvent for
6, 12, 18, and 24 h and then cleaned with water. The cleaned specimens
were dried at room temperature for 12 h, and then their contact angles
were measured. Additionally, three types of oil (i.e., diesel, vegetable
oil, and crude oil) were utilized as contaminants to assess the stability
of the specimens to contamination. A CIPA-coated specimen was contaminated
by dropping 30 μL of oil on its surface and leaving the oil
for 30 min. The contaminated surface was rinsed by flowing acetone
across its surface for 1 min and then by flowing water for 60 s. The
cleaned specimen was dried at room temperature for 12 h, and the contact
angle of the contaminated area was measured.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Surface Properties of the
CIPA Layer
Figure 2 shows photos
and SEM images of the CIPA-coated specimen. In Figure 2a, the black-colored surface is the CIPA-coated
area. The CNT content of the CIPA surface shown in Figure 2 was 5 wt %, and the contact
angle was larger than 160° on all of the manufactured surfaces.
As shown in Figure 2b, when the specimen was put in water, the water was fully lifted
off the surface by the CNTs, with air trapped between the CNTs. That
is, a plastron formed on the surface of the fabricated specimen, and
the surface of the submerged specimen was bright silver. When water
droplets are fully lifted by CNTs, they follow the Cassie–Baxter
wetting model and the contact angle can thus be calculated using the
Cassie–Baxter equation: cos θ = −1 + f(cos θo + 1). Here, f is the solid fraction, which is defined as the ratio of the wetting
area of the rough surface to the projected area, and θo is the contact angle of a water drop on a smooth surface. θo is determined by the chemical properties of the surface material,
and f is determined by the morphology of the surface.
Because CNTs are water-repellent and the contact area of a CNT with
water is extremely small (f ≪ 1), the CIPA
surface must have a very large contact angle. Figure 2c shows a cross-sectional SEM image of the
CIPA layer. The average thickness of the fabricated CIPA layer was
39 μm. Most of the CIPA layer consisted of CNT + PDMS layers,
whereas the adhesive layer was very thin. Figure 2d,e show SEM images of the top of the CIPA
surface. As shown in Figure 2d, the papillae of the CIPA surface have an irregular shape
resembling a tangled vine. Figure 2e provides an enlarged SEM image of the top part of
the papillae: densely entangled CNTs are exposed on the surface of
the CNT + PDMS layer. The length of the exposed CNTs was measured
to be 1.7 μm on average. The CNTs exposed on the CIPA-coated
surface have the superhydrophobic property, and the PDMS layer under
the CNTs is also water-repellent. Because water contacts only the
CNTs, which have an extremely small diameter (100 nm), the solid fraction
(f) is also extremely small, with the result that
the CIPA surface becomes superhydrophobic. Even if water directly
contacts the PDMS under very high pressure or when a water impact
is applied, the water is instantly repelled from the surface because
of the hydrophobic nature of the PDMS itself. Because of the hydrophobic
nature of the two materials (CNT and PDMS) composing the surface,
an additional coating of hydrophobic material is not necessary. Furthermore,
damaged areas can be immediately restored with newly appearing CNT
+ PDMS surfaces.

substrate.

surface of white silver. (c) SEM image of a cross section of the CIPA
layer. (d, e) SEM images at the surface of the CIPA layer.

The PDMS skin etching process, which is shown in Figure 1a, is very important
for attaching
a CNT + PDMS sheet to the substrate. When the adhesive was used without
first etching the surface of the PDMS sheet, the PDMS sheet did not
bond to the substrate. In contrast, when CNTs were exposed on the
surface of the PDMS sheet, it easily bonded to the substrate with
an adhesive (Figure 3d). The CNTs exposed by etching the PDMS skin are embedded into the
spray-coated adhesive during the bonding process shown in Figure 1c. After curing the
adhesive, the embedded CNTs grasp the solidified adhesive layer. Exposed
CNTs therefore play a key role in bonding the CNT + PDMS layer to
the substrate. In short, whereas CNTs exposed in the lower surface
of the CNT + PDMS layer contribute to the strong bonding between the
CNT + PDMS layer and the substrate, those exposed on the upper surface
contribute to superhydrophobicity. The level of hydrophobicity of
the CIPA surface depends on the CNT content. Figure 4 shows the changes in contact angle caused
by varying the CNT content. At CNT contents of less than 1 wt %, few
CNTs were transferred to the CIPA surface and, thus, the measured
contact angles on the CIPA surfaces were similar to those measured
from the surface of a pure PDMS sheet (∼115°). When the
CNT content is 1.5–2.5 wt %, the contact angles rapidly increased;
they increased more slowly above 2.5 wt %. All CIPA surfaces with
the CNT content exceeding 2.5 wt % demonstrated superhydrophobicity.

Table 1 compares
and summarizes various aspects of the physical and chemical performance
of the proposed CIPA surface and existing superhydrophobic surfaces.
While the CIPA surface performs similarly to those in other studies
on the thermal test, it performs far better on tests of physical impact,
such as pressure, bending, adhesion, and water jet, as well as on
chemical tests using contaminants and organic solvents. The results
and analysis of each test are described in detail below.

3.2 Stability for Heat and Pressure
Figure 5 presents the changes
in the contact and sliding angles of the CIPA surface with respect
to the temperature. For comparison, the change in the contact angle
of a pure PDMS sheet according to temperature is also shown. For the
CIPA surface, the contact angle was 163 ± 2° at the initial
room temperature (20 °C) and changed to 157 ± 3° at
300 °C. Even when the temperature was elevated to 300 °C,
the contact angle changed by only 6° compared to that at room
temperature; that is, the CIPA surface successfully maintained its
superhydrophobicity even at 300 °C. The sliding angle was maintained
below 2° up for temperatures up to 200 °C and reached 3.7
± 0.6° at 300 °C. This sliding angle is far smaller
than the 10° required for a superhydrophobic surface.

Figure 5 Stability test
results on heat and pressure. (a) Change of water
contact angles and sliding angles according to the temperature applied
to the CIPA layer and pure PDMS. (b) Change of contact angles and
sliding angles according to the applied pressure.

The pure PDMS sheet exhibited a contact angle of 116 ±
2°
at the initial temperature of 20 °C; at 250 °C, the angle
changed to 113°, which is not a significant change. However,
the angle rapidly decreased to 100 ± 6° at 300 °C.
In contrast, the CNT can operate at very high temperatures, 1200 °C
or higher, and its material property does not change at 300 °C.33 In the temperature range of 250–300 °C,
the change in contact angle of the CIPA surface was negligible but
the change in contact angle of the PDMS sheet was very large owing
to the CNTs.42−44 If a droplet is simultaneously in contact with the
CNTs and PDMS on the CIPA surface, the contact angle on the CIPA surface
will substantially decrease because surface degradation of the PDMS
occurs at 300 °C. Almost no change in contact angle on the CIPA
surface was observed, which implies that the water droplets were fully
lifted by the exposed CNTs on the CIPA surface. Therefore, even if
the properties of the PDMS that fix the CNTs change, the CIPA surface
can maintain superhydrophobicity.

Figure 5b illustrates
the changes in the contact and sliding angles on the CIPA surface
according to the applied pressure. When pressures of 0, 1000, and
10 000 kPa were applied to the surface, the measured contact
angles were 164 ± 3, 158 ± 3, and 156 ± 4°, respectively.
When the pressure was increased to 10 000 kPa, the contact
angle decreased by 8°; thus, the CIPA surface successfully maintained
its superhydrophobicity at a very high pressure. As the pressure was
increased, the sliding angle increased gradually, indicating that
the CIPA surface’s flatness increased with the pressure. Nevertheless,
the sliding angle was only ∼2° at 10 000 kPa. Because
the PDMS, which is an elastomer, and the CNT, which is 100 times as
strong as steel, were bonded together, even under high pressure, the
deformation was not large and the elastic resilience was excellent.
When the pressure source was removed, because of the elasticity of
the PDMS, the surface returned to its original structure and maintained
its superhydrophobicity.

3.3 Bending and Adhesion
Figure 6 shows the
results of the bending
test. After 100 bending cycles, cracks had developed in the CIPA layer
of folded region A–A′, as shown in Figure 6a. As shown in Figure 6b, the maximum crack width
was 50 μm. Figure 6c shows an enlarged SEM image of the bottom of the crack. New CNTs
that had been buried in the CNT + PDMS layer were exposed in the surface
of the cracked area. On the PDMS sheet, a crack began to form when
the sheet was bent back and forth, and the crack continued to the
end until the sheet was completely broken. In contrast, on the CNT
+ PDMS layer, the crack did not reach the end of the sheet because
of the binding force of the CNTs and their tangled morphology. Here,
we observe that a new CNT-implanted PDMS surface was created across
the entire surface, including both sides of the crack as well as the
bottom of the crack. The new CIPA surface is manufactured by initiation
of the crack and the separation of the CNT + PDMS layer, as shown
in Figure 1d,e. The
shape of the newly revealed cracked surface in the bending test is
the same as that of the original CIPA surface. The measured contact
angle on the cracked area was 160 ± 3°, which is similar
to that measured on the CIPA surface without cracks (Figure 6d). The proposed CIPA surface
therefore generates a new surface of the same structure as the original
surface even if part of the surface has been physically destroyed.
There is thus no significant change in the surface properties under
bending.

(b) SEM image of the crack in the folded region (the two dotted lines
demarcate the cracked region). (b) Enlarged SEM image of the inner
part of the crack. (d) Photo of the folded region after the 20 cycles
bending test.

Figure 7a shows
a photo with two water droplets on the CIPA surface before the adhesion
test (left) and after 20 cycles (right). The contact angle was 163
± 2° before the adhesion test and decreased to 158 ±
3° after 20 cycles. As shown in the water droplet images in Figure 7a, the superhydrophobicity
was maintained even after the test. SEM images of the adhesive side
of the tape were recorded after each cycle to determine the shape
and amount of material transferred to the tape’s surface during
the adhesion test. Figure 7b contains SEM images of the adhesive side of the tape after
one cycle. CNTs and pieces of PDMS from the CIPA surface were transferred
to the tape’s surface, such that the shape of the tape’s
surface resembled that of the CIPA surface. As shown in Figure 7c, as the number of cycles
increased, the amount of material transferred from the CIPA surface
to the tape’s surface was significantly reduced, until finally
no transfer was observed on the 15th cycle. Immobilized CNTs on the
CIPA surface with a bonding strength weaker than the adhesive strength
of the tape were removed from the CIPA surface via tape attachment
and detachment. This clearly shows that even after 20 cycles of the
adhesion test the remaining CNTs on the CIPA surface were fixed onto
the CIPA surface with a bonding strength greater than the adhesive
strength of the tape.

3.4 Water
Jet
Figure 8a shows the changes in the contact angle
with increasing water pressure. The contact angle exceeded 160°
for water pressure in the range 0–400 kPa and decreased to
158 ± 4° at 500 kPa. As shown in Table 1, the water pressure of 500 kPa is 11 times
higher than the strongest water pressure (45 kPa) applied to nanosurfaces
in previous studies.45 In the case of heavy
rain, water pressure can be as high as 100 kPa; the CIPA surface can
thus be used in an outdoor environment with heavy rain.46 When the water pressure was 400 kPa or less,
the CIPA layer maintained its adhesion to the substrate. However,
when the water pressure was above 500 kPa, the CIPA layer separated
from the substrate, as shown in Figure 8b. The wrinkle-shaped delamination area was located
at 3.3 mL away from the center of the water jet. As shown in Figure 8c, because of the
strong water pressure spreading from the center of the water jet in
a radial direction, a large shear stress (τ) was applied to
the elastic PDMS. The accumulated shear stress in the CIPA layer increased
with the distance from the center, and the separation began where
the shear stress exceeded the critical fracture shear stress between
the CIPA layer and the substrate. The shear stress inside the CIPA
layer was released by the permanent deformation in the form of wrinkles
rising above the separated CIPA layer. Figure 8d,e show top view SEM images of a specimen
tested under a water pressure of 500 kPa. As shown in Figure 8e, some areas that were directly
hit by the water jet were partially destroyed. This damage was observed
only in the central part of the CIPA surface, which received a strong
vertical water pressure from the water jet (region A of Figure 8c) but not in the regions where
the water flowed in the lateral direction (region B of Figure 8c). The average contact angle
measured in the area damaged by the water jet was 158 ± 4°,
which is still an excellent value for superhydrophobicity. This is
because, as analyzed in the previous bending test, new CNTs are exposed
on the damaged surface and they regenerate surfaces similar to the
initial CIPA surface, as shown in Figure 8e.

angles according

formed at a water pressure of 500 kPa. (c) Schematic illustration
of the mechanism of wrinkle formation. (d, e) SEM images of the CIPA
surface after the water jet test with a water pressure of 500 kPa.
The SEM images are of the center part of the CIPA surface (dotted
area in (c)). The inner part of the dotted line shown in figure (e)
was torn out by the strong water jet, thus forming a microsink.

3.5 Stability
to Organic Solvents and Oil Contamination
As shown in Table 2, even after the manufactured
specimens were submerged in three organic
solvents (acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol) for 6, 12, 18,
and 24 h, respectively, the changes in the contact angle were smaller
than 3°. Furthermore, no interfacial peeling between the CIPA
layer and the substrate was observed in any of the specimens. PDMS,
which accounts for most of the CIPA layer, is very stable in organic
solvents, and CNTs do not react with organic solvents.47,48 Because these two stable substances are bonded to the organic solvent,
the initial superhydrophobicity can be maintained even if they are
exposed to an organic solvent for a long time. As shown in Figure 9, the contact angles
measured on surfaces contaminated by diesel, vegetable oil, and crude
oil were 71 ± 4, 74 ± 3, and 83 ± 5°, respectively.
After the contaminants were removed, the measured contact angles were
changed to 161 ± 2, 159 ± 3, and 160 ± 3°, respectively,
all of which are very similar to those measured before the contaminants
were removed. On oil-contaminated surfaces, the chemical properties
of the oil are the key determinants of the water repellency of the
surface. After cleaning, the surface almost recovered its initial
chemical properties, regardless of the type of pollutant. This proves
that the CIPA surface is chemically very stable for the surfactants
used, i.e., oil-based contaminants and cleaners. Generally, superhydrophobic
surfaces formed by conventional coatings are vulnerable to chemicals
such as organic solvents, oils, and surfactants and thus the coated
surface can be damaged.

Figure 9 Stability test results of the CIPA surface for
oil contamination:
(a) diesel, (b) vegetable oil, and (c) crude oil. Whereas the photos
on the left show the contaminated states, those on the right show
the repaired surfaces with the cleaning process. The liquid dropped
on all surfaces is water. The size scale is the same.

ethanol	160 ± 4°	160 ± 2°	160 ± 2°	160 ± 2°	163 ± 1°	162 ± 3°	161 ± 4°	160 ± 2°	
isopropyl alcohol	160 ± 2°	162 ± 2°	160 ± 3°	161 ± 1°	163 ± 3°	161 ± 2°	160 ± 3°	160 ± 2°	
As shown in Table 1, the proposed CIPA surface has far better physical
and chemical
properties than those of other superhydrophobic surfaces that have
been developed to date. Even if part of the surface is physically
torn, a surface with almost the same properties as those of the initial
CIPA surface is regenerated automatically and immediately. When the
surface is chemically polluted by oils, it can recover its initial
state with simple cleaning. The superhydrophobicity of the proposed
CIPA surface is therefore continuously maintained, even in harsh physical
and chemical environments.

3.6 Applicability of CIPA Coating
on Various Substrates
To confirm the possibility of CIPA
layer formation on various substrate
materials other than copper and nonwoven fabric, CIPA layers were
formed on metal (SUS304, iNexus, Inc., Korea), glass (Microscope Slides,
Duran, Germany), and plastic (polystyrene Petri dish, SPL, Korea).
The substrates were washed with ethanol (99.98%, OCI Co., Ltd, Korea)
and DI water and dried. The CIPA layer formation process on these
substrates is identical to that shown in Figure 1. The CIPA surfaces formed on the four different
substrates are shown in Figure 10. All of the specimens exhibited contact angles larger
than 160°, and no CIPA layer was separated from the substrate
during the adhesion test using adhesive tape. This result verifies
that a CIPA surface can be formed on various substrates that can be
coated with an adhesive and can also be formed on surfaces of three-dimensional
objects with curved surfaces.

The left and right photos
are before and after coating, respectively.

4 Conclusions
We propose a new superhydrophobic
surface that is sustainable under
physically and chemically harsh conditions. Whereas some parts of
the CNTs are fixed to the PDMS and an adhesive multilayer bonded to
a substrate, the remaining parts are exposed on the outside of the
surface. Both the CNTs and PDMS exposed on the surface are hydrophobic,
and the surface is superhydrophobic because of the rough morphology
of the CNTs. The contact angles of the fabricated CIPA surfaces exceeded
160°, and the sliding angles were below 2°. The CIPA surfaces
exhibit excellent superhydrophobic characteristics with contact angles
higher than 154° and sliding angles lower than 4° in all
performance tests, including physical tests with heat, pressure, bending,
adhesion, and water jets and chemical tests with organic solvents
and surface contamination with oils. These results are due to the
excellent physical and chemical properties of the CNTs and PDMS in
the CIPA layer and the immediate regeneration ability of a damaged
CIPA surface. A unique property of the CIPA surface is that the surface
of a damaged area is immediately restored to the initial CIPA surface.
Moreover, CIPA layers are easily formed on various substrates, such
as metal, glass, and plastic, and the contact angle is higher than
160° on all of the CIPA surfaces. The proposed CIPA surface can
thus be directly applied to superhydrophobic surfaces that may be
exposed to harsh environments.
