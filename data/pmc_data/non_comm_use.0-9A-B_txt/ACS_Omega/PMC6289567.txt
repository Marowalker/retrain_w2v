Lead
release in a lead (Pb, anode)–iron oxide
(α-Fe2O3, cathode) galvanic system was
studied under the influence of synthetic extracellular polymeric substances
(sEPS). Sodium alginate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), and cytochrome
c represented extracellular polysaccharides, proteins, and electrochemically
active components, respectively. Microbiologically influenced corrosion
was investigated using sEPS and pelleted and resuspended Pseudomonas aeruginosa cells. Relative to the anaerobic
inorganic control, Pb release increased by 156, 202, and 198 μg/L
when sEPS was present on the cathode side at 200 mg/L (100 mg/L alginate
+ 100 mg/L BSA), 400 mg/L (200 mg/L alginate + 200 mg/L BSA), and
200 mg/L with 123.84 mg/L cytochrome c, respectively, under anaerobic
conditions. When the cathode was aerated, Pb release increased by
75, 260, and −71 μg/L under the aforementioned conditions,
all relative to the aerated inorganic control. When sEPS was instead
present on the anode side, sEPS caused localized corrosion on Pb and
resulted in higher Pb release than predicted by electric current. P. aeruginosa generally enhanced corrosion; when
cells were dosed in the anode side, part of the oxidized Pb was immobilized
by cells or organic compounds adhered to the electrodes.

Introduction
Environmental lead
exposure
is strongly linked to cognitive deficits in children1 and cardiovascular disease mortality in adults.2 While exposure has declined dramatically over
the past 50 years due to public health interventions,3 tap water remains an important mode of exposure.4 Significant sources of lead in this context include
legacy lead pipes, leaded solder, leaded brass, and galvanized steel
pipe.5

Lead release to drinking water
is a complex and dynamic process influenced by water chemistry variables,
such as disinfectant type,6 the availability
of orthophosphate or other corrosion inhibitors,7 the concentration of corrosive anions,8 and the composition of natural organic matter (NOM).7a Additionally, galvanic lead corrosion is a significant
cause of elevated lead levels in drinking water.8a,9 Galvanic
reactions between lead and other metals, including copper–brass
following partial lead service line replacement, have
been reported.10,117b,9,10 Corrosion products may also induce galvanic corrosion:
one possibility is galvanic interaction between colloidal/particulate
iron oxides and the surfaces of lead service lines. These reactions
might be prevalent in systems with both lead service lines and corroded
upstream iron mains.12

Microbiologically
influenced corrosion (MIC) is often an important corrosion pathway
of iron13 and copper14 pipelines, but biofilm has received comparatively little
attention as a driver of lead release from lead service lines.13,15 In one study of biofilm in lead service lines, bacteria from multiple
genera such as Massilia, Bacillus, Sphingomonas, Arthrobacter, Brevundimonas, Microbacterium, Paenibacillus, and Exiguobacterium were
detected, and these bacteria are either heavy metal tolerant or capable
of surviving in heavy-metal-rich environment;15b an earlier study of lead pipes recovered from the city
of Rochester in NY simply reported the detection of coliform bacteria
in the scales.16 Generally, biofilms in
drinking water distribution systems may induce biological corrosion
and harbor opportunistic human pathogens such as Legionella
pneumophila, Mycobacterium avium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.17 During the Flint water crisis, interruption
of corrosion control accompanied the occurrence of Legionella at points of use within the system.18 These observations suggest that corrosion may promote biofilm growth
by depleting disinfectant residuals, and biofilm can in turn influence
corrosion by altering the localized conditions at the metal–water
interface.

Conventional studies of MIC often focus on microbial
metabolisms such as [H] consumption and H2S generation
by sulfate-reducing bacteria.19 However,
biofilms are largely composed of extracellular polymeric substances
(EPS), including polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids.20 EPS can substantially exceed cell volume in
drinking water distribution systems.20a At the interface of metallic pipe/corrosion products and water,
polymeric substances act as the medium through which mass transfer
between the sessile microorganisms and their surroundings occurs.21 Previously, the functions of EPS have generally
been explored in the context of iron corrosion.21,22 With
regard to lead corrosion, EPS components may form complexes with lead.23 It is plausible that EPS components may also
be active in a colloidal dispersion of insoluble corrosion products
although this is relatively unknown. Since the role of EPS in the
corrosion of lead pipelines has not been extensively evaluated, this
study aimed to understand the effects of EPS in galvanic corrosion
of lead. The influence of model polymeric substances as synthetic
EPS (sEPS) and cells of a model opportunistic premises plumbing pathogen—P. aeruginosa—on the galvanic corrosion of
lead by hematite was investigated.

Results
and Discussion
In drinking water supply systems that contain
lead pipes, microbial corrosion on lead surfaces may cause breakdown
of the passive corrosion product layer, resulting in lead release.15a With active microbial metabolism, dissolved
oxygen (DO) may be gradually depleted at the biofilm and metal interface,
leaving a more anaerobic condition close to the lead metal surfaces
and a more aerobic condition at the biofilm surfaces. Deposition of
corrosion products, such as metal oxides, from the bulk water on or
near this corrosion site may lead to complicated galvanic corrosion
processes, which were simulated in this study.

Effects of Polymeric Substances
and Dissolved Oxygen
Polymeric Substances on the Cathode Side
In the absence of bacterial cells and cytochrome c (Cyto. c), sEPS
was a significant predictor of galvanic corrosion, based on a two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with DO and sEPS as predictors and theoretically
oxidized lead as the response (i.e., Pb2+ concentrations
equivalent to accumulated coulombs) (Figure S2-A1; sEPS on Fe2O3: F2,15 = 36.10, p < 0.0001). Compared to their respective
inorganic control conditions, sEPS1 on the cathode enhanced average
theoretically oxidized lead by 20 and 140% under aerobic and anaerobic
conditions, respectively (Figure 2A,C; sEPS on Fe2O3). sEPS2 increased
average theoretically oxidized lead by 9% under aerobic conditions
but decreased the same parameter by 41% under anaerobic conditions.
The same ANOVA showed significant interaction of sEPS and DO (Figure S2-A1; sEPS on Fe2O3: F2,15 = 20.00, p <
0.0001), whereas an analysis based on measured lead concentrations
showed insignificant interaction (Figure S2-A1; sEPS on Fe2O3: F2,14 = 0.42, p > 0.05). Thus, the selected levels
of sEPS may have affected oxygen diffusion, as described in the next
paragraph. Only a fraction of the oxidized lead was recovered from
the aqueous phase at pH 7.5–8.5 (Figure 2A,B: sEPS on Fe2O3),
presumably due to the formation of lead carbonate compounds on lead
coupon surfaces.7a For this reason, electric
current more accurately estimates total oxidized lead (blue rings
in Figure 2) as compared
with total detected aqueous lead (orange rings in Figure 2) in the absence of localized
corrosion at the anode.

Previous studies on the effect of EPS
on the corrosion of iron or steel often report divergent findings:
both corrosion induction and inhibition by EPS have been documented.24 Corrosion induced by EPS is usually attributed
to (1) the formation of a differential aeration cell caused by the
uneven distribution of EPS on metal surfaces and (2) encouraged anodic
reaction via complexation of oxidized iron. The passivation caused
by EPS is often explained by (1) the reduced diffusivity of DO in
a viscous
organic matrix and (2) stabilization of corrosion products.25 In this study, lead oxidation was not proportional
to the concentration of sEPS under aerobic conditions. This may be
explained by restricted diffusion of oxygen at the higher level of
sEPS. Observations under anaerobic conditions may be explained by
two other interacting processes: reduction of BSA and restricted diffusion
of reduced iron species. The measured potential of the cathode in
the presence of sEPS1 was between −0.47 and −0.73 V
(Figure S3). This overlaps with the potential
range for the reduction of disulfide bonds from BSA, −0.45
to −0.65 V,26 indicating possible
breakage of the disulfide bonds on the cathode. The negative current
upon contact of sEPS2 with iron oxide during a hematite–hematite
galvanic test supports this speculation (Figure 3): the side dosed with sEPS2 accepted electrons
from the other side. Although BSA is different from microbial extracellular
proteins, disulfide bonds may be prevalent in EPS. Proteins are known
to form disulfide bonds through the oxidation of cysteine thiols under
the oxidative stress of chlorine species,27 which are common in water distribution systems. In the presence
of sEPS2, the reduction of disulfide bonds was still likely, but binding
and accumulation of reduced iron on the cathode surfaces at higher
viscosity may have caused an early termination of the cathodic reaction.

Polymeric Substances on the Anode Side
sEPS on the anode
significantly affected theoretically oxidized
lead, but to a lesser extent than in the corresponding cathode experiments
(Figure S2-A1; sEPS on Pb: F2,14 = 7.14, p < 0.005). When the
average theoretically oxidized lead concentrations of the tested conditions
and the corresponding control conditions were compared, sEPS1 depressed
corrosion by 22 and 29% under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively;
sEPS2 had little effect (Figures 1A,C,E and 2A,C: sEPS on Pb). However, some of the measured aqueous lead
concentrations were higher than the theoretical values (Figure 2A,C: sEPS on Pb). For example,
the measured lead concentrations, 0.82–1.01 mg/L, were approximately
twice the theoretical lead level, 0.40–0.62 mg/L, when the
cathode was in an anaerobic condition and sEPS2 contacted the anode.
This discrepancy suggests the occurrence of localized or non-galvanic
corrosion. In a previous work, lead concentrations in excess of predictions
based on galvanic current were observed and attributed to localized
non-galvanic corrosion.28 In the presence
of free chlorine under continuous flow, the excess lead concentrations
that were observed by the authors may be attributed to redox reaction
between PbO2, a corrosion product, and lead metal. In another
study, extracellular polysaccharides from sulfate-reducing bacteria
were hypothesized to be responsible for the localized oxidation of
steel,22b although bacterial extracellular
polysaccharides are rarely reported as redox active unless they bind
redox-active ions, such as Fe3+ or U6+.29 Since the lead coupons in this study were acid-washed
and alginate is inert to common electron transfer reactions involving
metals and metal oxides,30 the much-higher
lead recovery indicates that a distinct non-galvanic corrosion occurred.
Size-exclusion chromatography and inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry (SEC ICP-MS) chromatograms (Figure 4) show that alginate was the major complexing
agent of lead in the sEPS mixture of alginate and BSA. Considering
the oxidative property of BSA, the observed non-galvanic reaction
could stem from the reduction of BSA and the complexation of ionized
lead by alginate. Whether the two reactions occurred simultaneously
or sequentially is unknown, but the lead–lead galvanic test
suggests that the sEPS demonstrate a strong ability to bind or withdraw
Pb2+ from the anode surfaces as opposed to accepting electrons
from the anode (Figure 3)—electrons flowed away from the lead
electrode that was in contact with sEPS2, indicating the generation
of excessive electrons on that electrode through complexation of lead.

Panel (B) shows the contrast of UV–vis absorption spectra from
cytochrome c before and after corrosion tests on the anode and cathode
in which anaerobic or aerobic states the condition on the cathode
side and those after the colon indicate the location of Cyto. c.

Effect of Dissolved Oxygen
When the corrosion under aerobic and anaerobic conditions is compared
in terms of the theoretically oxidized lead, the effect of DO was
positive and statistically significant (Figures 2A,C and S2: sEPS
on Fe2O3, F1,15 =
124.21, p < 0.0001 and sEPS on Pb, F1,14 = 156.60, p < 0.0001). An ANOVA
on measured aqueous lead concentrations reached the same conclusion.
For instance, when the sEPS contacted the cathode, the aerobic condition
yielded oxidized lead ranging from 0.36 to 0.74 mg/L, while the anaerobic
condition generated 0.27–0.40 mg/L lead. The measured potential
of the cathode was approximately −0.47 V with DO and declined
to approximately −0.66 V under anaerobic conditions, bringing
a dramatic drop, from 0.28 to 0.09 V, in the driving force of the
galvanic corrosion (Figure S3). Oxygen
is one of the main electron acceptors in the corrosion of metallic
piping materials.21 In this study, DO reduction
was expected on the cathode surfaces by electrons originating from
lead oxidation. The stepwise transfer of electrons from lead to iron
oxide and finally to oxygen is in line with the electron-conducting
activity of iron–sulfur compounds in sulfate-induced iron corrosion,
as both iron compounds are semiconductive.31

Galvanic Corrosion in the Presence
of P. aeruginosa
P. aeruginosa was employed to investigate corrosion
with cell adhesion on the electrodes. The duration of tests here allows
cell adhesion, which often requires 20–40 min,32 but is short enough that biofilm formation via the consumption
of sEPS was minimized.33 When bacterial
cells were dosed with sEPS (Figure 1B,D), the interaction between sEPS and DO was not significant
in ANOVA with either predicted or observed lead release as the response
(Figure S2-A2). The main effects of DO
and sEPS on lead corrosion were significant, except in the ANOVA with
measured lead concentrations and sEPS on the cathode (DO: F1,13 = 4.02, p > 0.05; sEPS: F2,13 = 1.82, p > 0.1). Here
as well, theoretically oxidized lead was considered a better metric
of galvanic reactions. Cell lysis occurred during the test: the optical
density at 600 nm (OD600) of the cell suspensions before and after
the tests showed decreased cell density at the end (average 2 ×
108 CFU/mL), while soluble chemical oxygen demand (sCOD)
measurement showed 51–119% increase in soluble organics. The
released intracellular compounds during cell lysis, an essential part
of natural EPS, may have affected the corrosion process.

Generally,
corrosion current in the presence of P. aeruginosa was slightly higher and more sustained as compared against tests
without the bacterium (Figure 1). When P. aeruginosa cells
were on the cathode, theoretical lead oxidation was significantly
increased in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions (10–220%
increase, Figure 2).
Hence, certain intracellular materials, including ions and small molecules,
might have facilitated (1) the transfer of electrons on the cathode
surfaces to DO or other oxidative compounds and/or (2) the diffusion
of reduced iron away from the cathode. When P. aeruginosa cells were on the anode, the corrosion current was similar to those
cases when there were no cells; however, the detected aqueous lead
concentrations were lower than those cases when cells were absent
(sEPS on Pb in Figure 2B,D compared with sEPS on Pb in Figure 2A,C). This was not expected because the pH
slightly shifted to the acidic range (7.2–7.6) at the end of
test runs, and the decreased pH encourages lead dissolution. This
discrepancy implies that more lead ions were immobilized on the anode
via complexation with organic compounds/cells adsorbed on the anode.
Nevertheless, a conclusion that sessile P. aeruginosa on lead surfaces is capable of impeding lead corrosion and release
may not be valid because the P. aeruginosa in this study was not expected to have formed a mature biofilm on
the anode. In an active biofilm-covered corrosion site, various other
proteins or enzyme cofactors can potentially affect the reaction,
and some of them are redox active around the potentials that are relevant
to corrosion. Some have been demonstrated to conduct electrons in
extracellular spaces, such as extracellular redox-active iron–sulfur
proteins34 and extracellular flavins/riboflavins.35 These observations warrant more studies on the
interaction between EPS and cells in lead corrosion.

Effects
of Electrochemically Active Small-Sized
Proteins
Microorganisms secrete electrochemically active
molecules during extracellular respiration on insoluble electron acceptors
such as iron oxides and manganese dioxide.36 These oxidized forms of metals are commonly found in the corrosion
scales inside lead service pipelines.37 Therefore, local biofilm-covered anaerobic spots on lead service
lines may encourage the growth of microorganisms that are actively
involved in the reductive dissolution of oxidized iron, manganese,
or even lead. Furthermore, direct oxidation of reduced metal–metal
ions by some lithoautotrophic and acetogenic microorganisms has been
reported,38 and these reactions may also
occur in drinking water distribution systems. Hence, it is worthwhile
to examine the roles of electrochemically active molecules during
corrosion processes. Cytochrome c, mobile in EPS or associated with
cytoplasmic membranes, is widely reported as the reducing/oxidizing
equivalent during microorganism–metal oxide redox reactions38,39 and was chosen here as a model molecule.

Effects of Cytochrome c
on the Cathode
With Cyto. c on the
cathode, three-way ANOVA of theoretically oxidized lead on DO, cytochrome
c, and cells showed that (1) the interaction between DO and cytochrome
c was significant (Figure S2-B1, F1,13 = 47.24, p < 0.0001)
and (2) the interaction between DO and cells was also significant
(Figure S2-B1, F1,13 = 10.82, p < 0.01). Except for DO (Figure S2-B1, F1,13 = 114.85, p < 0.0001), the main effects of the
two other factors were not significant, suggesting that in the presence
of cytochrome c, availability of oxygen to the cathode is crucial.
The effect of DO on current is noticeable: with the cathode aerated,
the current was high and sustained ranging from 10 to 12 μA;
with the cathode de-aerated, the current gradually diminished (Figure 1). The same ANOVA
with aqueous lead concentrations as the response showed that the interaction
between DO and cytochrome c was significant (F1,13 = 4.78, p < 0.05); the main effects
of DO and cytochrome c were also significant. In addition, a hematite–hematite
galvanic test showed that cytochrome c, without oxygen, cannot ennoble
iron oxide (Figure 3). The UV–vis absorption spectra show peaks near 520 and 550
nm emerging after the reaction of cytochrome c on the cathode (Figure 4B), implying the reduction of cytochrome c.40 This evidence leads to the conclusions that during these
corrosion tests (1) cytochrome c can be oxidized by DO and (2) cytochrome
c may have mediated electron transfer from a more reduced cathode
to DO and thus facilitated the oxidation of the cathode by DO. Moreover,
the SEC ICP-MS chromatograms (Figure 4A) indicate that cytochrome c dramatically alters the
apparent molecular weight distribution of lead. Although present at
a low level, cytochrome c may be better able to complex with lead
compared to alginate, perhaps due to its relatively small size (12 000
Daltons). Thus, it is reasonable to assume that cytochrome c may have
also complexed ferrous ions, assisting the cathode to revert to the
oxidized condition.

galvanic systems with sEPS and cytochrome c under anaerobic conditions.
Electric current usually deviates from the equilibrium value (i.e.,
zero) after the addition of organic compounds at the 3 h mark. All
organic compounds were dosed to the side connected to the common (COM)
port of a multimeter. The gray color line indicates zero current.
Positive current indicates the expulsion of electrons from the side
with organic compounds (behaves as an anode), while negative current
indicates the acceptance of electrons by the electrode contacting
organic compounds (behaves as a cathode).

Effects of Cytochrome
c on the Anode
With Cyto. c on the anode, a three-way ANOVA
of theoretically oxidized lead on DO, cytochrome c, and cells showed
that all the interactions were not significant and only the main effect
of DO (Figure S2-B2, F1,13 = 58.08, p < 0.0001) was significant.
In contrast, ANOVA with measured lead concentrations as the response
showed that the interaction between cytochrome c and cells was significant
(Figure S2-B2, F1,13 = 8.65, p < 0.05) and the main effects of cytochrome
c (F1,13 = 42.23, p <
0.0001) and cells (F1,13 = 12.99, p < 0.001) were also significant. When the cathode was
under anaerobic condition, the corrosion current in the presence of
cytochrome c generally fell in the low range, below 3 μA, as
evident from Figure 1 (sEPS on Pb, C&D). However, the detected aqueous lead levels
were high, in the range of 1–2.5 mg/L, and exceeded the predicted
levels from corrosion current. These observations indicate that (1)
galvanic current cannot reveal the effect of cytochrome c and its
interaction with DO/cells on the anode and (2) when cytochrome c is
in contact with lead, it encourages non-galvanic corrosion. The lead–lead
galvanic test with cytochrome c supports the idea that cytochrome
c can accept electrons from lead (Figure 3). Although an environmental biofilm actively
conducting dissimilatory metal oxide reduction usually contains a
fraction of oxidized cytochrome c,41 microorganisms
involved in a corrosion reaction may directly oxidize metal surfaces
with the assistance of oxidized cytochrome c.13b,31c,38,42 Together with
its lead-binding ability (Figure 4A), the current work suggests that electrochemically
active proteins, such as cytochrome c, may result in localized non-galvanic corrosion
of lead.42

While a system that is
composed of model compounds is less complex than natural biofilm matrices,
the results presented here nevertheless imply that biofilm EPS may
participate in the corrosion process of lead-based materials. This
can happen via complexation of metal ions as well as redox reactions
with corrosion products or metal surfaces. These implications, especially
the latter, accord with findings from recent microbial corrosion and
bioelectrochemical studies. Despite the well-accepted hypothesis of
cathodic depolarization or [H]/H2 utilization during the
sulfate-driven MIC, direct electron transfer from metal atoms to bacteria
through iron and iron–sulfur compounds may occur.31 These studies showed that sulfate-reducing and
methane-generating microorganisms directly extracted electrons from
the surfaces of metals or corrosion products. This direct electron
transfer might have relied on either cytoplasmic membrane-associated
or extracellular cytochrome c.39 In another
case, extracellular hydrogenase or formate dehydrogenase from Methanococcus maripaludis catalyzed the formation
of H2 or formate on iron surfaces in the absence of cells,
and the formation of these reducing equivalents was well correlated
to the corrosion process.13b Additionally,
biofilms may trap and accumulate trace amounts of NOM containing redox-active
functional groups that resemble quinones;43 some of these are still oxidative following disinfection44 and may act as an electron sink in a corrosion
reaction. Therefore, during MIC of lead pipelines, commonly observed
binding or complexing of metal ions21,24 probably takes
place in concert with redox reactions between redox-active molecules
in EPS and the solid surfaces, especially in a local anaerobic environment
away from the bulk liquid. These reactions are relatively independent
of traditionally reported galvanic reactions and may significantly
influence the dynamics of lead corrosion and release. Future studies
on the corrosion of lead pipes at pilot- or full-scale could be designed
to address some of the limitations of this study. In particular, the
role of biofilm under more representative drinking water conditions
that include elements related to a well-developed corrosion scale,
corrosion control agent, and a disinfectant residual should be examined.
In this way, the synergies observed here between EPS and lead release
can have greater application context.

Materials and
Methods
Experimental Design
Scanning electron microscopy images
from previous studies9,45 show that the corrosion scales
on lead service lines are often porous, especially when a phosphate
corrosion inhibitor is applied. The interstitial space covered by
biofilm in lead service line corrosion scales may develop oxygen-rich
and oxygen-depleted zones. Therefore, the corrosion of lead was examined
when the cathode side was in one of two extreme DO conditions, aerobic
or anaerobic, while the anode was always maintained in an anaerobic
condition. Sodium alginate and bovine serum albumin (BSA) were employed
as models for polysaccharides and proteins in EPS, respectively; cytochrome
c was used to represent electrochemically active small-sized proteins
in EPS.46 These model compounds were added
to either the anode chamber or the cathode chamber to study their
influence on the corrosion process. Two groups of tests with sEPS
were studied as shown in Table 1; the first group only involved sEPS, while the second group
incorporated planktonic bacterial cells in the system. Within each
group, three different sEPS conditions were examined: 100 mg/L alginate
+ 100 mg/L BSA (labeled sEPS1); 200 mg/L alginate + 200 mg/L BSA (labeled
sEPS2); and 100 mg/L alginate + 100 mg/L BSA + 123.84 mg/L cytochrome
c (C7752, Sigma-Aldrich) (labeled Cyto. c). These concentrations were
chosen to simulate the concentrations of
EPS in biofilm or at the biofilm and water interface.47 Since heavy-metal-resistant microorganisms mostly inhabit
copper and lead pipelines,15b,43,47 the lower end of a commonly studied EPS concentration range (a few
hundreds to 10 000 mg/L)13a,22b,22c was selected. The concentration of cytochrome c was
determined according to a previous study on Geobacter spp.48 Microorganisms have been shown
to occur both on top and beneath corrosion scales and to induce pitting
corrosion in copper and iron pipelines.13c,14b Since MIC in lead corrosion has rarely been reported,15b,16 MIC of copper was deemed analogous to MIC of lead. Therefore, bare
lead coupons were applied in this preliminary study of the effect
of sEPS on lead corrosion; corrosion scale was allowed to develop
over the 8 h test period. The control tests in the base electrolyte
with either aerobic cathode or anaerobic cathode were labeled sEPS0
(i.e., no sEPS), and the tests carried out with bacterial cells were
denoted XX + cells.

Two-way ANOVA was conducted to compare the
main effects of DO (anaerobic and aerobic) and sEPS (sEPS0, sEPS1,
and sEPS2) and the interaction effect between DO and sEPS on galvanic
corrosion. In the presence of cytochrome c and cells, three-way ANOVA
was applied to examine the main effects of DO (anaerobic and aerobic),
cytochrome c (sEPS1 and Cyto. c), and bacterial cells (with and without
cells) plus the interactions among these three factors; all tests
were conducted at a significance level of 0.05. Two sets of data were
analyzed by ANOVA: the measured total aqueous lead concentrations
and the theoretical lead release as predicted by Faraday’s
law from galvanic current (eq 1). Wolfram Mathematica 11.3 was used for comparisons and for
figure preparation. 1  where C is the equivalent (or theoretical total

Galvanic Cells
A double-chamber electrochemical reactor
(Figure S1) was used in this study. Spark
plasma sintered α-Fe2O3 disks7a and lead coupons (Ames Metal Products Co.) served
as the cathode and anode, respectively. For each test run, a pair
comprising one Fe2O3 disk and one lead coupon
was randomly selected from four identical Fe2O3 disks and three identical lead coupons. The half-cells (250 mL/side)
were each made from a media bottle, and they were connected via a
salt bridge (2.5% of agar and 3 mol/L KCl). The body of the salt bridge
was a 32.5 cm-long MasterFlex #16 silicone tube. The electrode and
the external measurement circuit were connected using an alligator
clip and titanium wires (0.051 in. diameter, McMaster Carr). The base
electrolyte (pH ≥ 7.5) was 60 mg/L sodium bicarbonate in ultrapure
water; the pH in the anode chamber increased after test runs but was
always below 8.5, while the pH in the cathode chamber varied little.
When cells were present in the electrolyte, the pH at the end of the
reactions was in the range of 7.2–7.6. Two extra lines made
of MasterFlex #14 pump tubing were added to allow gas exchange. Nitrogen
sparging (Air Liquide, 2 L/min, ≥30 min) was applied to create
the anaerobic condition. The corrosion current was recorded by a digital
multimeter (PeakMeter MS8236). Electrode potentials were measured
against Ag/AgCl electrodes (BME 8 W, BioMed Products Inc), and details
are available in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). Fresh stock solutions of sEPS (100× concentrated)
were prepared every 2 weeks and stored at 4 °C. Before a test
run, the sEPS were added by mixing the stock solutions with the base
electrolyte. Flakes of cytochrome c were dissolved in the base electrolyte
when needed. Thin films of polymeric substances were allowed to form
through the partitioning of sEPS components between the liquid and
solid phases. As a control, the effect of chloride on galvanic corrosion
was also evaluated (Figure S4).

To
oxidize the reduced portion of the Fe2O3 disks
after each test, the disks were thoroughly rinsed with water, dried
at 102 °C, and then baked at 750 °C for 3 h.49 Lead coupons were immersed in dilute nitric
acid for 10 min and then rinsed with ultrapure water before each test.
Lead is known not to form corrosion scales in dilute nitric acid.50 When necessary, the coupons were polished with
320-grit sandpaper. After each test, the electrodes were removed from
the solutions, and 4 mL of trace-metal-grade nitric acid was added
to desorb lead from the glass bottle surfaces; the bottles were sealed
and stored at 4 °C for at least 24 h before analysis. When sEPS
were present, nitric acid digestion (2 mL HNO3 + 2 mL 30%
H2O2 + 15 mL sample, 105 °C and 2 h) was
applied to disintegrate the alginate flocs. For electrolytes with
suspended cells, sCOD and OD600 were measured before and after the
test. For sCOD measurement (Hach, 3–150 mg/L), an aliquot (10
or 20 mL) of the suspension was vacuum filtered through a 0.45 μm
poly(ether sulfone) filter membrane (UltraSep, GVS Life Science);
the residual filtrate after sCOD measurement was added back to the
original suspension. The cell suspensions were also acid-digested
before metal analysis. To recover any adsorbed lead, the used filter
membrane was acid-digested (10 mL HNO3 + 10 mL HCl + 10
mL water, 150 °C for 30 min and topped with HNO3 and
another 30 min). The concentrations of lead were measured by ICP-MS.51 The complexation of dissolved lead and iron
by different sEPS components was examined by SEC with ICP-MS detection;
the detailed method can be found elsewhere.52 Information on peak identification is included in the Supporting
Information (Figure S5).

To study
localized corrosion in the presence of sEPS, galvanic tests were conducted
in the same double-chamber electrochemical cell with the same kind
of electrode at both ends. The experiment was run following these
steps: de-aeration, equilibrium current (i.e., zero current) collection
for 3 h, disconnection, injection of a specified amount of sEPS/cytochrome
c stock solution to the control side (connected to the COM port),
de-aeration of the control side, and current collection for another
3 h. A half level of cytochrome c was used (61.92 mg/L). All electrodes
were pretreated as described previously, and bicarbonate base electrolyte
was used.

Preparation of P. aeruginosa
P. aeruginosa was cultured for 10
h (until the cell density reached 108 CFU/mL) on a shaking
incubator (35 °C, 175 rpm) in tryptic
soy broth (3 g/100 mL, 100 mL) supplemented with yeast extract (1.25
g/L). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (3800 rpm, 10
min), and the EPS were removed following an established method.53 Details of EPS removal can be found in the Supporting Information. The cell numbers before
and after a test run were quantified by OD600. Average cell density
in the electrolyte at the beginning of the tests was 4 × 108 CFU/mL according to a correlation between the OD600 and the
heterotrophic plate count.
