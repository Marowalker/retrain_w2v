In this article, biodiesel was prepared using a novel
free liquid lipase A from Candida antarctica (CALA) as a catalyst in the presence of excess water. The methanol
tolerance of CALA was investigated. The effect of reaction conditions,
including the molar ratio of soybean oil to methanol, water load,
CALA load, reaction temperature, and reaction time, was evaluated.
Reaction thermodynamics and kinetics were also analyzed. Results showed
that free liquid lipase CALA showed excellent methanol tolerance in
the reaction system using one-step addition of methanol and can be
used to prepare biodiesel with water load of 12–14%. The influence
of three transesterification variables on biodiesel yield was water
load > temperature > time. The transesterification conditions
were optimized by response surface methodology as follows: CALA load
5%, substrate molar ratio (soybean oil/methanol) 1:7, water load 14%,
reaction time 26 h, and temperature 38 °C. The maximum biodiesel
yield (92.4 ± 0.8%) was obtained under optimal conditions. The
activation energy for biodiesel formation was 52.58 kJ/mol. Kinetic
parameters Km′ and Vmax were 4.84 × 10–1 mol/L and 6.85 × 10–2 mol/(L·min), respectively. The mechanism of
CALA-catalyzed transesterification was also proposed.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biodiesel, composed of
fatty acyl methyl esters or fatty acyl ethyl esters,1 is a clean, nontoxic, biodegradable, and renewable green
fuel, which was first proposed in the 1900s.2,3 However,
biodiesel did not attract much attention until the crisis of fossil
fuel in the early 1980s.4,5 Recently, with the gradual
exhaustion of fossil fuel and the significant enhancement of people’s
awareness of environmental protection, biodiesel has been used as
an alternative for fossil fuel in many countries. According to the
characteristic of raw materials, biodiesel can be prepared by the
transesterification of triglycerides (TGs) in vegetable oil with alcohol6−8 or the esterification of free fatty acids (FFAs) with alcohol.9−11 And the performance and emission values of biodiesels from vegetable
oils, for example, soybean oil, were nearly the same as those of diesel
fuels.8

Chemical catalysts and enzymes12,13 are often used to prepare biodiesel. Compared with chemical catalysts,
enzymes are used for biodiesel production due to their mild reaction
conditions, high selectivity, high specificity, and cleaner process.14−17 Among these enzymes, two forms (immobilized enzymes and free enzymes)
are often used for biodiesel production. Although the immobilized
enzymes can improve the stability of the enzyme, the high cost and
strong adsorption of the by-product glycerol make the large-scale
application of immobilized enzymes limited.18,19 Recently, due to the lower cost compared to that of the immobilized
enzymes, simple operation, low reaction temperature, and high catalytic
activities, free liquid enzymes have shown potential in transesterification.20,21

In the enzymatic reaction for biodiesel production, alcohol
has an inhibitory effect on lipase, which seriously affects the activity
of the enzyme. In order to solve this problem, organic solvents22 and stepwise addition method of methanol23 can be used. For example, Cerveró et
al.24 achieved 90% biodiesel yield using
a method of three-step addition of alcohol, which was 42% higher than
that obtained by the one-step addition method. However, these methods
drastically increased the complexity of experimental operations and
boosted the costs of operations in large scale and industry. Therefore,
the development of novel methanol-resistant lipase has become a new
focus.

Free liquid lipase A from the yeast Candida
antarctica (CALA) is a serine hydrolase that has a
typical catalytic triad composed of Ser184, His366, and Asp334. Recently,
CALA has shown excellent activities for large substrates, especially
for tertiary alcohols. CALA also has some unique activities, such
as trans fatty acid selectivity,25 enantio
selectivity,26,27 substrate specificity,28 hydrolysis characteristics,29 and thermostability.30 Recently,
CALA has been used to concentrate DHA and EPA from fish oil,31 prepare high-enantiomer β-amino esters,32 and synthesize monoglycerides (MGs).33 However, the information on the application
of free liquid CALA for biodiesel production was seldom available.

In this work, in order to decrease the cost of biodiesel preparation
and enhance reaction efficiency, free liquid CALA was used as a catalyst
to catalyze the transesterification of soybean oil with methanol.
The methanol tolerance of CALA was also investigated. The effects
of substrate ratio, water load, CALA load, temperature, and time on
the CALA-catalyzed transesterification were evaluated and optimized
using response surface methodology (RSM). The thermodynamics and kinetics
of the reactions were evacuated. The mechanism of the CALA-catalyzed
transesterification was also proposed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Reaction Progress on the CALA-Catalyzed
Transesterification for Biodiesel Production
Figure 1A shows that with reaction
progress, biodiesel yield rapidly increased in 8 h. The maximum biodiesel
yield (93.8 ± 1.6%) was obtained at 36 h. And the contents of
TG and diglyceride (DG) in the reaction product at 36 h were 5.2 ±
0.5% and 1.0 ± 0.1%, respectively. MG was not found in the reaction
production, which might be attributed to the fast reaction of MG and
methanol to form biodiesel. Only a small amount (<2%) of FFA formed
by the hydrolysis of TG (Figure 1C) was found in the reaction
system within the first 8 h. After that, FFA disappeared, which suggested
that liquid CALA had little catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of
oil in the reaction system.

transesterification (A); the mechanisms of transesterification (B)
and hydrolysis of TG (C). Conditions: temperature, 30 °C; CALA
load, 5 wt %; substrate molar ratio, 1:7 (oil/methanol); water load,
12 wt %.

2.2 Effect of Substrate Ratio on Biodiesel Production
Figure 2 shows that
the maximum biodiesel yield (88.1 ± 1.5%) was achieved when the
mole ratio of methanol was 7 times that of oil, which was due to the
increase of methanol, promoting the forward reaction for biodiesel
preparation. However, with further increase of the mole ratio of methanol,
biodiesel yield decreased from 88.1 ± 1.5% of 1:7 (oil/methanol)
to 49.0 ± 0.8% of 1:12, which was related to the presence of
excessive methanol in the reaction system, which can decrease enzymatic
activities. A similar inhibitory effect of methanol on the lipase
activity can also be found in previous reports.34,35

Figure 2 Effect
of substrate ratio on the biodiesel yield. Conditions: water load,
8 wt %; temperature, 30 °C; and CALA load, 5 wt %.

In order to overcome the deactivation of lipase
in the excess methanol, a two-step addition method of methanol (7
times methanol was first added into the reaction system, and the residual
methanol was added after 4 h) was studied. The result showed that
when the substrate molar ratio was 1:9, the maximum biodiesel yield
using the two-step addition method was 73.2 ± 0.3% at 48 h. Furthermore,
when the ratio of oil to methanol was 1:9, 75.1 ± 0.9% of biodiesel
yield was obtained at 48 h using the two-step addition method. However,
these biodiesel yields were all lower than that of 1:7 molar ratio
using the one-step addition method (88.1 ± 1.5% at 48 h). These
results showed that 1:7 molar ratio using the one-step addition method
was a good choice for the liquid CALA-catalyzed reaction.

Interestingly,
the optimal ratio of oil to methanol, 1:7 (mol/mol), was higher than that of previous reports
(oil-to-methanol, mol/mol), 1:323 and 1:4.36 Moreover, the methanol tolerance of liquid CALA
was also better than that of other lipases, such as lipase @ZIF-67
(oil-to-methanol molar ratio 1:6, biodiesel yield 80.6 ± 2.0%),37 lipase from Pseudomonas fluorescens(38) (oil-to-methanol molar ratio 1:3, biodiesel
yield 83.8%), recombinant lipase from Rhizomucor miehei (oil-to-methanol molar ratio 1:3, biodiesel yield 86.6%),5 and liquid recombinant lipase 2 from Candida rugosa(18) (oil-to-methanol
molar ratio 1:3, biodiesel yield 95.3%). Overall, free liquid CALA
had excellent tolerance to methanol for biodiesel production using
the one-step addition of methanol.

2.3 Effect of Water Load on Biodiesel Production
Figure 3 shows that
when the water load was less than 12% [water/(oil and methanol), w/w],
biodiesel yield gradually increased from 0 to 93.8 ± 1.5%, which
was ascribed to the fact that with the increase of water load, the
emulsification of the reaction system was enhanced and more activation
interfaces are formed. The maximum biodiesel yield (93.8 ± 1.5%)
was achieved when the water load was 12%. When the water load was
>12%, the biodiesel yield decreased, which was attributed to the
fact that excessive water can dilute the concentrations of CALA and
methanol. Meanwhile, the presence of water clusters in the CALA activity
center can change its structure and decrease its activity.39 Furthermore, the hydrolysis of oil was improved
in the presence of excessive water (Figure 1c), which resulted in the increase of by-products
and the decrease of biodiesel production. The optimal water load of
the liquid CALA-catalyzed transesterification reaction was 12%, which
was 0.5% (water/oil, w/w) higher than that catalyzed by the liquid
lipase Callera Trans L40 and 10% (water/oil,
w/w) higher than that catalyzed by liquid lipase NS81006.41 Besides, free liquid CALA also had better stability
at high water load than some immobilized enzymes. such as lipase @ZIF-67
(biodiesel yield 70% at the optimal water load of 10%),37 lipase PS (biodiesel yield 65% at the optimal
water load of 3.8%),42 lipozyme TL-IM (biodiesel
yield 69% at the optimal water load of 4%),43 and so forth. However, liquid lipase from Mucor miehei(44) showed high catalyst activity at a
high initial water load (25%).

Figure 3 Effect of water load on the biodiesel
yield. Conditions: temperature, 30 °C; substrate ratio, 1:7 (oil/methanol);
CALA load, 5 wt %.

2.4 Effect of CALA Load on Biodiesel Production
Figure 4 shows that
with enzyme load increasing from 1 to 7%, the maximum biodiesel yield
increased from 62.2 ± 0.8 to 93.0 ± 1.3% (Figure 4a). Likewise, the initial transesterification
rate also increased from 0.025 to 0.466 mol/(L·min) (Figure 4b). However, when
the CALA load was >7%, no significant changes in transesterification
rate and biodiesel yield were found (Figure 4a). A linear relationship (Y = 7.35x – 4.85, R2 = 0.936) of CALA load and the initial reaction rate was found (Figure 4b), which indicated
that the CALA-catalyzed transesterification was mainly controlled
by kinetics and the effect of external mass transfer can be negligible.
A similar external mass transfer effect can be minimized using agitation
in other enzymatic reactions.45

Figure 4 Effect of CALA
load on the biodiesel yield (a) and the initial reaction rate (b).
Conditions: temperature, 30 °C; substrate molar ratio, 1:7 (oil/methanol);
water load, 12 wt %.

2.5 Effect of Transesterification Temperature
on Biodiesel Production
Appropriate temperature can accelerate
the transesterification rate and increasing biodiesel yield. When
the temperature was ≤40 °C, biodiesel yield gradually
increased with the increase of temperature (Figure 5a). Meanwhile, the initial transesterification
rate increased significantly from 0.8 × 10–2 to 3.1 × 10–2 mol/(L·min), which was
mainly attributed to the fact that transesterification is endothermic
and mass transfer limitation can be reduced at high temperature. The
maximum biodiesel yield (84.0 ± 1.2%) was achieved at 40 °C.
However, when the temperature was >40 °C, biodiesel yield
decreased from 84.0 ± 1.2% at 40 °C to 18.2 ± 1.6%
at 60 °C, which was due to the inactivation of liquid CALA. A
linear relationship between the initial reaction rate [Ln V0, mol/(L·min)] with temperature (1/T, 1/K) (Y = 6.327x –
16.826, R2 = 0.970) was found (Figure 5b). Therefore, according
to Arrhenius equation (eq 1), the activation energy (Ea) of biodiesel
formation was calculated as 52.58 kJ/mol. 1

yield (a); the relationship between the initial reaction rate (ln V0) and the reaction temperature (1/T) (b). Conditions: substrate molar ratio, 1:7 (oil/methanol); CALA
load, 7 wt %; water load, 12 wt%.

In eq 1, V0, T, and A are the initial transesterification rate (mol/(L·min)),
reaction temperature (K), and pre-exponential factor, respectively.

2.6 Model Fitting and Response Surface Analysis
The above results of reaction variables (reaction time, substrate
ratio, water load, lipase load, and reaction temperature) show that
the effects of reaction time, water load, and reaction temperature
on biodiesel yield were significant. Therefore, the interaction effect
of these three reaction variables was evaluated and optimized by RSM
to achieve the highest possible biodiesel yield (Table 1).

Multiple regression fitting of experimental data in Table 1 was conducted by
RSM, and the quadratic multinomial regression equation of biodiesel
yield and independent variables X1 (reaction
time), X2 (water load), and X3 (reaction temperature) was obtained as eq 2. 2  

The regression equation variance analysis
and significance test in Table 2 suggested that the predicted value and the actual value were
highly consistent (R2 = 0.946). Meanwhile,
the model was significant (ρ < 0.05) and was proper for the
analysis of and prediction for biodiesel yield. In addition, the effect
of three variables on biodiesel yield decreased in the order of water
load > temperature > reaction time (Figure 6). According to the 3D surface plots, the
highest biodiesel yield (92.4 ± 0.8%) could be achieved under
optimized conditions: 38 °C, water load 14%, 26 h, CALA load
7 wt %, and substrate molar ratio 1:7.

2.7 Kinetic Constants of the CALA-Catalyzed Transesterification
for Biodiesel Production
According to a previous report,46 the kinetic mechanism of the CALA-catalyzed
transesterification corresponds to the Ping-Pong Bi–Bi mechanism.
The kinetic equation of bisubstrates competitive inhibition is as the eq 3. 3  

In eq 3, V0 and Vm are the initial transesterification rate and the maximum
transesterification rate (mol/(L·min)), respectively. [A] and
[B] are the concentrations of substrate A and substrate B (mol/L),
respectively. KAm and KBm are the Michaelis–Meton
constants. KiA is the inhibition constant
of substrate A. The relationship between methanol concentrations ([A])
with the initial rate (V0) is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 The relationship between
the initial transesterification rate (V0) and methanol concentration ([A]) at low methanol concentrations
(a); Lineweaver–Burk (b). Conditions: 40 °C; soybean oil,
3 mmol; water load, 15 wt %; CALA load, 5 wt %.

Figure 7a shows that when the concentration of methanol ([A]) was
>4.83 mol/L (i.e., when the molar ratio of oil to methanol was
<1:7), the initial transesterification rate (V0) decreased sharply due to the inhibition effect of methanol.
Therefore, the kinetic constants Vmax and Km′ of the transesterification were evaluated at low methanol concentrations
(<4.83 mol/L). Keeping the amount of soybean oil constant and varying
the concentration of methanol (from 1.66 to 4.83 mol/L), the transesterification
could be regarded as a pseudo-first-order reaction, as shown in eq 4. 4  

In eq 4, [A] and Km′ are the methanol concentration
(mol/L) and the apparent Michaelis constant, respectively. According
to the Lineweaver–Burk double reciprocal method, eq 5 was obtained from Figure 7b as follows. 5  

Consequently, Km′ and Vmax of free liquid CALA-catalyzed transesterification
were calculated as 0.484 mol/L and 6.85 × 10–2 mol/(L·min), respectively.

2.8 Transesterification Mechanism Catalyzed by
CALA for Biodiesel Production
The catalytic triad of CALA
consisted of serine (Ser184), aspartate (Asp334), and histidine (His366).47 According to the structure of CALA and the catalytic characteristic
of lipase, the mechanism of free liquid CALA-catalyzed transesterification
of soybean oil with methanol is proposed in Figure 8. TG first enters the active site of CALA,
where Ser184 is activated by His366. Meanwhile,
the Ser184 attacks the carbonyl carbon atom of TG (step
1). And the tetrahedral intermediate 1 is formed. Next, the intermediate
1 is dissociated. The rest of TG, at the same time, accepts the proton
from His366 and then leaves from the active site in the
form of DGs (step 2). Afterward, methanol enters the active site of
CALA, attacks the carbonyl carbon atom bound to Ser184,
and contributes one proton to His366 to form the intermediate
2 (step 3). Finally, with the collapse of intermediate 2, biodiesel
(FAME) is formed and CALA activity site is recovered (step 4). MG
and glycerol (Gl) are also formed in the same way.

Figure 8 The mechanism of CALA-catalyzed
transesterification for biodiesel production.

3 Conclusions
Free liquid CALA was successfully
used as the catalyst for biodiesel production. And liquid CALA showed
excellent methanol tolerance in the reaction system using the one-step
addition of methanol. CALA also showed good catalysis performance
in the presence of excess water (14%). The effect of transesterification
variables on biodiesel yield was water load > temperature >
time. The transesterification variables were optimized by RSM as CALA
load 5%, molar ratio of oil to methanol 1:7, water load 14% at 38 °C
for 26 h. Under these conditions, biodiesel yield was 92.4 ±
0.8%. Moreover, the activation energies (Ea) for biodiesel formation was 52.58 kJ/mol, and reaction kinetic
values Km′ and Vmax were 0.484 mol/L and 6.85 × 10–2 mol/(L·min),
respectively. These results provide a promising approach for biodiesel
production in green and renewable reaction systems.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Free liquid CALA was purchased
from Novozymes (Denmark). Soybean oil was provided by Yihai Jiali
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Methanol (analytical grade) was from
Fuyu Fine Chemical Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China). Standards, including
oleic acid, methyl oleate, MG, DG, and TG, were purchased from Sigma
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Hexane was chromatographic grade and
was from Kemiou Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (Tianjin, China).

4.2 Enzymatic Transesterification
Soybean
oil (oil-to-methanol, 1:3–1:12, mol/mol) and water (4 ≈
35 wt %, based on the total mass of soybean oil and methanol) were
weighed and preheated to 20–60 °C in a water bath with
a thermostatic magnetic stirrer (agitation speed 500 rpm). Then, free
liquid CALA (1 ≈ 10 wt %) and methanol were added into the
reaction mixture. Sample (20 μL) was withdrawn at regular intervals.
Hexane (2 mL) and anhydrous sodium sulfate (1 g) were used to dissolve
the sample and remove water, respectively. Finally, the sample was
centrifuged for 2 min, and the upper solution was used for gas chromatograph
(GC) analysis. The biodiesel yield was calculated from eq 6. 6  

In eq 6, mFAME, mTG, mDG, mMG, and mFA are the mass of
FAME, TG, DG, MG, and FA (g), respectively, from the GC results adopting
an external standard method.

4.3 GC Analysis
The biodiesel yield and
product composition were analyzed by GC (Agilent 7890B) with a flame
ionization detector (FID) equipped with a DB-1ht column (30 m ×
250 μm × 0.10 μm). The temperature of the oven was
first increased from 170 to 200
°C at 2 °C/min and then from 200 to 290 °C at 20 °C/min,
and then it was further increased from 290 to 320 °C at 6 °C/min
and remained at 320 °C for 1 min; finally, it was increased from
320 to 360 °C at 20 °C/min and remained at 360 °C for
7 min. The total run time was 34.5 min. A volume of 1 μL of
the solution was injected. The temperature of both the injector and
the FID was 350 °C. The flow rates of hydrogen, nitrogen, and
air were 30, 4, and 300 mL/min, respectively.

4.4 RSM Design
The effect of reaction
conditions (reaction time, water load, temperature) on the biodiesel
yield was designed and evaluated by Design Expert 8.0.5 (Table 1). The data were analyzed
using the regression equation obtained from the model as follows 7  where Y is the biodiesel
yield; Xi and Xj are reaction conditions;
β0 is the intercept; βi, βii, and βij are the coefficients of the model.

4.5 Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were conducted at least in triplicate, and the experimental data were
analyzed by SPSS 20.0. All results were expressed as average ±SD,
and P < 0.05 indicated that the difference between
the values was significant.
