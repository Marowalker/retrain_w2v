A new
method for producing a dispersed gold nanoparticle (Au NP)
array to anchor probe DNAs onto a DNA-sensing electrode has been developed.
A homogenous gold sulfide (Au2S) core (precursor of Au
NP) was biomineralized in the cavity of a mutant apoferritin (K98E)
with enhanced negative outer-surface charges. We employed a slow chemical
reaction system utilizing a stable cationic gold complex. K98E could
attract the gold complex, and Au2S NPs were synthesized.
K98E enabled dispersed placement of the synthesized Au2S core onto a cationic 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) layer
on a substrate. UV–ozone treatment eliminated the protein shells
and APTES layer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed that the
Au2S core was reduced to Au NPs under the same treatment.
Atomic force microscopy (AFM) clearly showed that the combination
of apoferritin versatility, chemical system design, and UV–ozone
treatment successfully produced a dispersed Au NP array on the substrate.

Introduction
In the field of genetic diagnostics based
on DNA hybridization,
a probe-DNA array with specific spatial regularity and controlled
density is ideal.1−3 An excessively dense probe-DNA array prevents hybridization
and results in a low detection efficiency. An appropriate distance
between the probe DNAs provides a high hybridization efficiency. Controlled
density leads to a reproducible signal-to-noise ratio (S/N), a low
error rate, and quantitative analysis of DNA in practical sensing
timelines. However, conventional approaches toward probe-DNA array
fabrication, such as DNA solution droplet spotting systems, fail to
regulate the number of probe DNAs on each spot.4 A new fabrication method for a probe-DNA array with specific
interdistance and density is needed.

Gold nanoparticle (Au NPs)
are widely used in the field of biological
detection due to their versatility and biological inertness. It was
also reported that Au NPs could anchor probe DNA through the formation
of sulfide bonds between Au and thiol-terminated DNA.5−7 Therefore, it is highly desirable to develop a new process to place
homogenous Au NPs on an electrode, with specific interdistances, to
anchor probe DNA. The Au NP size should be as small as possible to
control the number of attaching probe DNAs. A large electrostatic
repulsive force among the probe DNAs would limit the number of attaching
probe DNAs; ultimately, only one probe DNA attaches onto one Au NP.

In previous work, we produced a recombinant apoferritin (rFer),
K98E, with enhancing negative outer-surface charges.8 K98E was composed of 24 subunits of a deletion mutant,
which includes 9–175 amino acids of the L-chain apoferritin
subunit and the 98th positively charged lysine residue, that was genetically
replaced by negatively charged glutamic acid. We proved that K98E
could synthesize homogenous iron oxide NPs internally. Taking advantage
of the enhanced negative charges, we designed an elaborated electrostatic
interaction system between K98E and a lithographically patterned 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane
(APTES) nanodisk array on a SiO2 substrate, 45 nm in diameter,
with 200 nm intervals.8 Under specific
solution conditions and Debye lengths, each K98E with an iron oxide
NP was successfully placed one by one on the APTES nanodisk. Therefore,
if Au NPs can be synthesized in K98E, K98E could deliver its accommodating
homogenous Au NP to the APTES layer or nanodisk, as designed.

There are several works that report that native apoferritin (heterogeneous
supramolecule)9 and exterior- and interior-surface-modified
apoferritin10 produce Au NPs using anionic
chloroauric ions and Au coordinated by four Cls as a gold source.
However, it was hard for K98E, with enhanced negative charges, to
attract anionic gold complexes. A new chemical system is required
to realize Au NP synthesis.

In this work, we report an alternative
method to place independent
Au NPs less than 5 nm in diameter on the substrate. First, gold sulfide
(Au2S) NPs were synthesized in the K98E cavity using cationic
instead of anionic gold complexes. Second, the obtained K98Es with
Au2S NP cores were allowed to adsorb as a dispersed array
on an APTES-covered substrate. Finally, UV–ozone treatment
was conducted to eliminate the APTES layer and protein shell and extract
sulfur from Au2S NPs simultaneously. The new method successfully
produced a dispersed monolayer array of Au NPs.

Results and Discussion
Apoferritin biomineralizes excessive iron ions into an iron oxide
core inside the cavity and stores them until use, in vivo. Native
apoferritin surface charges are thus located to attract positive ions
around threefold channels connecting the outer solution and inner
cavity. Positive iron ions are introduced through the narrow threefold
channels, and the incorporated ions start crystallizing at collected
negatively charged residue sites on the inner surface. This elucidated
NP synthesis mechanism is generally accepted and the introduction
of positively charged ions is the first key process. We reported that
more than 20 kinds of NPs could be successfully formed in vitro by
mimicking native biomineralization.11 On
the contrary, preceding works on Au NP synthesis in native ferritin
used a negative gold complex, Au coordinated by four Cls. It was plausible
that the complex overcame local charge arrangement on the native ferritin
outer surface. However, it was considered difficult for the K98E with
enhancing negative outer-surface charges to attract the negative gold
complex.

In our previous work, we synthesized Au2S NPs in native
apoferritin in vitro,12 where a new reaction
system, the slow chemical reaction system (SCRY [CdS, CuS]), was introduced.13,14 In the SCRY, a stable cationic gold complex15 with the formula Au[CS(NH2)2]2+ was used to suppress nucleation outside apoferritin. AuCl4– ions and thiourea produces Au[CS(NH2)2]2+, which should be stable
enough to remain in a dissolved state during the NP synthesis. It
was expected that the negatively enhanced K98E would electrostatically
accumulate Au[CS(NH2)2]2+, slowly decomposing into Au2S or AuS.12,16 The decomposed gold–sulfur ions in the vicinity of the threefold
channels would have a chance to enter the cavity. Consequently, the
Au2S core would form inside the apoferritin.

The
Au complex formation rate is critical for Au2S NP
synthesis. The rate depends greatly on the solution pH. We first studied
the pH dependence. K98E (0.5 mg/mL), KAuCl4 (2 mM), and
thiourea (20 mM) in various buffer solutions at pH 6–9 were
incubated overnight. NP synthesis was inspected using 400 nm optical
absorbance because NPs show optical absorbance at 400 nm and the protein-shell
absorbance was negligible (Figure 1a). The absorbance should be proportional to NP growth.
The absorbance increased with higher pH and reached a maximum at pH
8.0 (Figure 1b). This
tendency was in good agreement with our previous work with native
ferritin.12 This is reasonable because
the rates had no relation with the ferritin surfaces.

(b) Absorbance at 400 nm of Au2S–K98E, which was
synthesized at (b) various pHs and (c) different molar ratios of the
Au ion source against thiourea. In (b), (i) pH 6.0, phosphate; (ii)
pH 7.0, phosphate; (iii) pH 7.5, TES; (iv) pH 8.0, TAPS; and (v) pH
9.0, TAPS were used, with a uniform mole ratio of 1:10 for Au–thiourea.
In (c), Au–thiourea molar ratios of (i)1:4, (ii) 1:10, (iii)
1:15, and (iv) 1:20 were used at pH 8.0. Absorption spectra were recorded
in a 1 cm cell.

Second, the other important
factor for the Au complex formation
rate, thiourea concentration, was investigated. Thiourea stabilized
the gold complex and slowed the decomposition rate. K98E (0.5 mg/mL
), KAuCl4 (2 mM), and thiourea (8–40 mM) in 50 or
100 mM TAPS, pH 8, were incubated overnight, and the core formation
was checked. The NP formation increased in proportion with the thiourea
concentration (Figure 1c) and saturated over 30 mM. A moderately excess amount of thiourea
stabilized the gold complex and suppressed nucleation in the bulk
solution, which led to an increase in NP formation. In the case of
a much higher concentration, the decomposition of the complex was
too slow to synthesize NPs overnight. From these results, we concluded
that the most appropriate synthetic conditions were 0.5 mg/mL K98E,
2 mM KAuCl4, and 30 mM thiourea in TAPS, pH 8.

Figure 2 shows transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images of the synthesized NPs inside K98E.
K98E stained with aurothioglucose shows dispersed black dots and surrounding
white rings, 10 nm in diameter. As aurothioglucose could not enter
the cavity, the black dots should be the synthesized inorganic NPs,
Au2S. The white ring diameter agreed well with the K98E
protein diameter (12 nm) and thus these white rings were considered
to be negatively stained K98E protein shells (Figure 2a). Bare Au2S NPs quickly aggregate
in aqueous solutions, but there were no NP aggregates, which assures
that the NPs are protected by a protein shell. Figure 2b shows the area in which ferritin was highly
condensed. Inorganic NPs were separated by the protein shell (invisible
because of no staining). This indicates that NPs would disperse even
in highly dense ferritin areas and that protein-shell elimination
would produce a dispersed two-dimensional NP array. A high-resolution
TEM image without staining shows that the NPs were generally spherical
but had various shapes (Figure 2c). Additionally, a clear lattice fringe at some regions of
the NPs was observed (Figure 2c). The lattice fringe did not appear across the whole area.
This strongly indicates that the NPs were a collection of single crystals
with some parts in an amorphous-like state. It is generally accepted
that there are many nucleation sites on the inner surface and nucleation
occurs simultaneously. Some of the nuclei grow into a core. Therefore,
it was plausible that the artificial Au2S synthesis had
multiple nucleation events. There were no NPs larger than 7 nm, and
the average diameter was determined from the nonstained TEM images
as roughly 6 nm. The same sample was used in the following X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements.

Figure 2 TEM images
of synthesized Au2S–K98E. Images were
obtained (a) with and (b, c) without staining with aurothioglucose.

XPS measurements were performed
to evaluate the elemental compositions
of the synthesized NPs. XPS analyzes the elemental composition and
chemical or ionic binding states of elements in a material. Because
XPS can detect a depth of only several nanometers, we fixed the K98E
with NPs in a monolayer manner on a cationic APTES-modified Si wafer.
From narrow binding energy range measurements (Figure 3), Au 4f and S 2p signals were clearly observed.
The binding energies (BEs) of Au 4f7/2 and 4f5/2 were 83.7 and 87.4 eV, respectively, at which the full width at
half-maximum (FWHM) was 1.1 eV. Although the BE and FWHM at the 4f7/2 peak are almost the same as those of Au0,17,18 it is uncertain whether the oxidation state of Au inside K98E is
assigned to typical Au0. According to a theoretical analysis
on the population of chemical states in Au2S NPs, gold
atoms in Au2S have mixed covalent/ionic bonding forms.19 XPS analyses in previous work have also shown
that the Au 4f peaks in gold sulfide compounds were positioned to
Au0.20 Therefore, the present
XPS results suggest that at least the Au in K98E does not include
multivalent cationic forms. The position at 162.1 eV was assigned
to the S 2p3/2 signal. The atomic ratio of Au–S,
estimated from the elemental analysis, was 7:3. Taking all of the
data into consideration, it could be concluded that the synthesized
core in K98E had a chemical composition of Au2S.

of Au2S–K98E deposited on an APTES-modified
Si wafer before/after UV–ozone treatment in the (a) Au 4f,
(b) S 2p, (c) C 1s, and (d) N 1s regions. The spectra represent (i)
as-prepared and (ii) UV–ozone-treated samples.

This study experimentally demonstrates that Au2S NPs
can be formed in the K98E by the SCRY. The next step was to convert
Au2S NPs to Au NPs and eliminate the protein shell, fundamental
in the realization of density-controlled probe-DNA placement on a
substrate. We applied UV–ozone treatment for the elimination
of the proteins shells and the APTES layer. We also reasonably anticipated
that activated oxygen can attack the Au2S, generate gaseous
SOx, and degrade the Au, as in our previous work PtS decomposed to
PtOx NPs on UV–ozone treatment.21

XPS spectra of the Au 4f, S 2p, C 1s, and N 1s regions after
UV–ozone
treatment for 1 h at 115 °C are shown in Figure 3. There is a small C 1s peak, which could
be due to adventitious carbon. The BE of Si 2p3/2 was 99.4
eV, and no charge upshift was observed without using an electron flood
gun. This result indicates that charge compensation can occur between
the thin insulating layer of SiO2 and the surface elements
by removing the protein shell and APTES layer from the sample. The
removal of the protein shell and APTES can also be confirmed by the
absence of the N 1s peak (Figure 3d), indicating that proteins accommodating NPs were
eliminated through the UV–ozone treatment.

The signal
from sulfur disappeared completely, indicating that
Au2S could be decomposed to Au. There was a slight upshift
in the Au signal from the initial state after UV–ozone treatments.
The Au 4f7/2 BE was positioned at 84.2 eV. One of the possible
reasons is due to the oxidation of Au. UV–ozone or O2 plasma treatment could oxidize Au clusters, NPs, and flat surfaces
and mostly caused the formation of Au2O3.22−27 Energy shifts in the oxidation of gold have been reported around
+1 to 2.4 eV in relation to zerovalent states, but these data were
not in agreement with our results, which were +0.5 eV after UV–ozone
treatment. Therefore, the slight shift in Au 4f spectra could not
be attributed to the production of oxidized Au. On the other hand,
it is known that the relative BE shift of Au depends on the type of
support substrates and particle size.24,28 Oxides such
as SiO2 and TiO2 cause positive shifts; for
instance, the BEs of Au0 and Au3+ in 6 nm Au
NPs placed on TiO2 were shifted by +0.35 and +0.97 eV,
respectively, in bulk metallic gold.28 For
the size effect, BE shifts of Au NPs from 1.5 to 6 nm in size on different
substrates were observed. In our study, the produced Au contacted
the SiO2 surface directly and the elimination of S atoms
by UV–ozone treatment reduced its size. Therefore, it is reasonable
to attribute the slight positive shift to surrounding circumstances
and size reduction.

The distribution of NPs after UV–ozone
treatment was studied
by AFM observation (Figure 4). Using the APTES layer for the placement of Au2S–K98E, ferritin was electrostatically adsorbed and high-density
adsorption was realized. The ferritins were isolated independently
on the substrate (Figure 4a). The AFM image height profile analysis showed the maximum
height difference was ca. 10 nm, which indicates that the ferritin
consisted of a monolayer without forming large agglomerates. After
UV–ozone treatment, the NPs remained independent and there
was no NP aggregate. The height profile showed that the particle size
was reduced to less than 5 nm (Figure 4b). The results clearly showed that a dispersed monolayer
array of Au NPs was produced.

an APTES-modified
Si wafer (a) before and (b) after UV–ozone treatment.

The obtained SiO2 substrate
with a Au NP array was used
to anchor single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). A thiol-terminated 19-mer ssDNA
solution was incubated overnight on the substrate. A SiO2 substrate without a Au NP array was also underwent the same procedure
as a control. After removing unreacted ssDNA, XPS measurements of
both substrates were performed to check DNA fixation. The XPS measurement
results are shown in Figure 5. In the P 2p region, it showed that there was a peak for
the substrate with the array at around 134 eV, and the substrate without
the array had a background noise level peak. The result suggested
that Au NP array anchored ssDNA, which has phosphate backbones. N
1s signals, which come from bases, showed a clear difference. The
substrate with the array showed a peak at around 400 eV, and the peak
from the substrate without the array is hard to distinguish. These
two results confirmed that the ssDNAs were fixed on the substrate
with a Au NP array. The results demonstrated that probe DNAs can be
fixed using the process described in this contribution.

Conclusions
For
applications in DNA sensing, precisely regulated placement
of Au NPs acting as anchorages for probe DNA is a key technique. The
rFer K98E could place an inner NP onto lithography-patterned cationic
nanodisks. However, the negatively charged K98E could not synthesize
Au NPs using a typical anionic gold complex. We employed the SCRY
and introduced a stable cationic gold complex with thiourea. The Au
complex gradually decomposed under the weak alkalic condition, and
Au2S NPs inside the K98E cavity was successfully achieved.
We also demonstrated, for the first time, that UV–ozone treatment
alone realized the elimination of protein shells and the APTES layer
and, simultaneously, the conversion of the Au2S core into
Au NPs. The resultant isolated Au NPs on the substrate were able to
anchor probe DNAs. This biological method has merits, that is, the
obtained nanoparticles are homogenous and small. The outer surface
of the protein shell can be genetically and chemically modified to
deliver NPs to designated modified positions on a substrate, which
has already been shown in our previous works.29−31 Taking the
performance of K98E and placement of a single K98E onto a cationic
APTES disk into consideration, this method will control the density
and distance of a Au NP array more precisely. The obtained dispersed
Au NPs will realize a highly efficient and low-error probe-DNA array.

Experimental
Section
Au2S Synthesis in the Apoferritin Cavity
The synthesis of Au2S NPs in K98E (Au2S–K98E)
was performed in a mixed solution of KAuCl4, as a gold-ion
source, and thiourea, SC(NH2)2, as a sulfur
ion source, which also acts as a ligand. The basic reaction conditions
were set as follows: 0.5 mg/mL K98E, 2 mM KAuCl4, and 30
mM thiourea in 50 or 100 mM TAPS buffer solution at pH 8. The effect
of solution pH on core formation was investigated using phosphate,
2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid, and Tris buffer
solutions. The solution mixture containing KAuCl4 and thiourea
was slowly added into the K98E buffer solution, and the resultant
homogenous solution was incubated overnight at room temperature. After
incubation, precipitates were discarded by centrifugation (15 000g, 15 min), and the supernatant was purified by size-exclusion
chromatography (SEC), with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) as an elution buffer.
After SEC, the fraction was further purified by density-gradient centrifugation
(DGC), with sucrose density gradients of 15, 30, and 60%. The samples
were stored at 4 °C.

After SEC, the solution pH and thiourea
concentration dependencies on core formation in K98E were investigated.
The concentrations of K98E after SEC were set at 0.4 mg/mL using the
Bradford assay method, and the optical absorbance at 400 nm (cell
length = 1 cm) was measured by UV–vis spectroscopy. For XPS
and AFM analyses, the ferritin (apoferritin with core) with the eluents
after DGC were used, for which the estimated absorbance at 400 nm
was over 4, as the concentration of K98E was 0.4 mg/ml. The second
core-formation reaction was also processed after SEC purification
of the first core reaction with about half the amount of reagents
compared to that in the first reaction. The samples after the first
and second core-formation reactions showed no obvious difference in
the absorbance at 400 nm.

The quality of NPs in K98E was studied
by TEM (JEOL JEM-2200FS
and JEM-3100FEF). The ferritin molecules were stained with aurothioglucose,
which cannot enter the cavity. This staining method can distinguish
ferritin with a Au2S core from apoferritin. High-resolution
measurements were also carried out to observe core lattice fringes.

Characterization of the Synthesized NPs
XPS (Shimadzu
Kratos Axis 165) was employed to analyze the elemental compositions
of the synthesized NP cores. Mono Al Kα X-rays at 120 W were
used to excite the photoelectrons. A hemispherical analyzer with a
pass energy of 40 eV was used. All spectra were calibrated using C
1s = 284.8 eV as a reference. For quantitative analysis of the peak
positions, line widths, and relative areas for the elements, the spectra
were fitted with Gaussian functions after linear background subtraction,
using original instrument software.

Ferritin Adsorption and
NP Array Production
An APTES
monolayer to fix Au2S–K98E was prepared by the vapor-deposition
process. A Si wafer with a thermally oxidized layer was cleaned by
UV–ozone treatment for 10 min at 115 °C (SAMCO UV-1) and
subsequently left in a container filled with APTES vapor with less
than 10% relative humidity for 5–6 h. APTES-deposited substrates
were rinsed with ethanol and milliQ water and then baked for 3 min
at 110 °C. Droplets of Au2S–K98E in Tris buffer
(pH 8) were deposited onto the APTES-modified substrates and left
for 20 min to complete the ferritin adsorption. The substrates were
then rinsed with milliQ water. NP placement was confirmed by AFM observation
(SII SPI3800N/SPA400).

Protein-shell removal from Au2S–K98E was performed by UV–ozone treatment. Au2S–K98E-dispersed APTES substrates were set in the ozone
generation chamber and exposed to UV–ozone for 60 min at 115
°C. For XPS analysis, the samples were promptly placed in the
XPS analysis chamber within 30 min after UV–ozone treatment.

DNA Immobilization onto Au NP Array
DNA immobilization
was carried out using 5′-thiol-modified 19-mer ssDNA with a
six-carbon linker. After the activation of the thiol group by tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine
at pH 7.5, the reaction solution was purified using Bio-spin 6 chromatography
columns (Bio-Rad). The resultant droplet (20 μL) in a buffer
(20 mM Tris, 0.4 M NaCl, pH 7.5) was placed on the SiO2 substrate with a Au NP array. The sample was incubated overnight
at room temperature in a small container to avoid solution evaporation.
After incubation, the substrate was immersed twice in the buffer solution
for 20 min each, followed by rinsing four times with pure water to
remove unreacted ssDNA completely. As a control, a substrate prepared
using apoferritin without Au2S NPs was also treated using
the same procedure. Sample characterization and DNA fixation were
performed by XPS measurements.
