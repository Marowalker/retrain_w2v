A decomposition mechanism of H2O2 by triphenylphosphine
oxide (TPPO) is presented. TPPO is often incorporated in proton-exchange
membrane electrolytes as a moiety to inhibit the H2O2-induced degradation of the membranes. However, it has not
been revealed how TPPO decreases the concentration of free H2O2 in the membranes. Following the experimental X-ray
structures, the TPPO dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules was used as the calculation model. The vibrational spectrum
calculations for various hydration numbers show that this model correctly
reproduces the spectral peaks of TPPO capturing H2O2. On the basis of this model, the H2O2 decomposition mechanism by the TPPO dimer was searched. It was consequently
found that this reaction proceeds through three steps: (1) Hydrogen
transfer from H2O2 to the P=O bond of
TPPO, (2) Hydrogen transfer from the −OOH group to the −OH
group, and (3) O–O bond formation between O2 groups.
The calculated vibrational spectra for the reactants and intermediates
indicated that the first and second steps are activated by vibrational
excitations. Moreover, the third step giving low barrier heights is
considered to proceed through two reaction paths: directly producing
the O2 molecule or going through an HOOOH intermediate.
Interestingly, this reaction mechanism was found to use the violation
of the octet rule for the P=O double bond, resulting in the
strong H2O2 binding of TPPO.

Introduction
Degradation of the
proton-exchange electrolyte membrane is a central
factor determining the durability of fuel cells.1,2 Proton-exchange
membranes are known to be deteriorated by hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, coming from the oxygen O2 crossover.3−5 That is, H2O2 is thought to cleave chemical
bonds in membranes. For many years, it has been accepted that the
H2O2-induced bond cleavage proceeds through
the production of hydroxyl OH radicals. Recent studies have, however,
reported that the OH radical-induced mechanism is inconsistent with
actual membrane degradations: the ratio of the decomposition fragment
products in the Fenton test, which is considered to produce OH radicals,
is significantly different from that in the actual degradation of
fuel cells.6,7 Very recently, we theoretically proposed
that a H2O2-induced decomposition mechanism
also causes the degradation of membranes under actual fuel cell operation
conditions.8 That is, we proposed an H2O2-induced degradation mechanism, in which the
H2O2 molecule, which is hydrated in the protonated
water cluster of the doubly hydrated sulfonic acid groups of the Nafion
membrane, directly attacks the ether bond of the membrane. What should
be noted is that despite the fact that H2O2 certainly
deteriorates proton-exchange membranes, only a few reliable methods
have been suggested to remove H2O2 from proton-exchange
membranes while maintaining the performance of the membranes.

The use of phosphine oxides, X3P=O (X is a group
such as phenyl group), is one of the available methods for decreasing
the amount of free H2O2 in proton-exchange membranes.9 Although phosphine oxides are produced as unavoidable
useless byproducts in some reactions such as the Wittig,10 Staudinger,11 and
Appel12 reactions, they are often used
to detect oxygen in the production of phosphines because of the strong
P=O bond. This P=O double bond has attracted attentions
from a theoretical standpoint due to the clear violation of the octet
rule, which establishes the tendency of atoms to prefer to have eight
electrons in the valence shells.13,14 For consistency
with this rule, the P=O bond had been interpreted as an ionic
bond for many years.15−19 Theoretical studies, however, have revealed that this P=O
double bond is not an ionic bond and is formed by the donation of
the lone electron pair of the oxygen atom to the X–P σ*
bond.14,20−22 This P=O bond
is also known to strongly bind to H2O2 molecules.
Thierbach et al. found that triphenylphosphine, Ph3P=O,
forms very short hydrogen bonds with the hydrogen of halogen acids23−25 and H2O2,26 indicating
the strong O–H bonds between the P=O and H groups. Hillard
et al. recently investigated the reactions of the tertiary phosphine
oxides, X3P=O, for X = methyl (Me), butyl (Bu),
octyl (Oct), cyclohexanyl (Cy), and phenyl (Ph) groups with H2O2 to produce X3P=O·(H2O2)x (0.5 ≤ x ≤ 1.0) to explore the purification of phosphine
oxides.27 By means of single-crystal X-ray
measurements, they found a cyclic dimeric structure, (Cy3P=O·H2O2)2 for the H2O2 adduct of tricyclohexanylphosphine oxide, Cy3P=O. They also found in the infrared (IR) spectra of
tributylphosphine oxide, Bu3P=O, that the bound
H2O2 is partially decomposed after 4 h in toluene
at 80 °C, and the produced H2O is efficiently and
quantitatively removed to yield clean phosphine oxides. This strongly
suggests that the phosphine oxides could reduce H2O2 in proton-exchange membranes.

Note that a phosphine
oxide moiety, triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO)
moiety, has already been introduced in proton-exchange membranes to
decrease the degradation of the membranes. Fu et al. first inserted
the TPPO moiety in the hydrophobic group of the sulfonated poly(arylene
ether sulfone) proton-exchange membrane to enhance its water uptake
and consequently found that this moiety leads to strong intermolecular
interactions and high oxidative stability.28 Miyake et al. used a sulfonated TPPO moiety in the hydrophilic group
of block copolymer proton-exchange membranes and succeeded to improve
their hydrophilic/hydrophobic phase separation and oxidative stability.29 The TPPO moiety is considered to bind and/or
decompose H2O2 in the proton-exchange membranes.
These results seem to indicate that phosphine oxides decompose H2O2 molecules even in the form of moiety of the
membranes. However, it has never been revealed how TPPO molecules
accelerate the decomposition of H2O2. H2O2 decomposition is known to significantly depend
on the presence or absence of catalysts. Although H2O2 is very slowly decomposed in supercritical water in the absence
of such catalysts, it is rapidly decomposed into water and O2 molecules in the presence of catalysts such as metal ions. Many
conventional decomposition mechanisms have assumed the initial production
of OH radicals in, for example, the following reactions30 1   2   3  

Since there are many
water molecules in the channels of proton-exchange
membranes, OH radicals are considered to be very unstable: the lifetime
of OH radicals is 100 ns in aquo. H2O2 also
requires 50.2 kcal/mol to dissociate into OH radicals.31,32 As mentioned above, the H2O2 decomposition
rapidly proceeds in the presence of metal ions. However, it needs
no TPPO to proceed. H2O2 is, therefore, thought
to be decomposed without producing OH radicals in membranes with TPPO
moieties, although the decomposition mechanism has not yet been revealed.

In this study, we theoretically propose a decomposition mechanism
of hydrated H2O2 molecules by TPPO. On the basis
of the past experimental studies, we assume that H2O2 is decomposed through the cyclic dimeric structure of TPPO,
(Ph3P=O·H2O2)2 (see Figure 2). After
detailing the computational methods, we first explore the optimized
hydration structures of the TPPO dimer capturing H2O2 and their vibrational spectra. Then, we calculate several
steps of the H2O2 decomposition reaction by
TPPO and the associated reactions. We finally investigate the overall
decomposition reaction mechanism focusing on why TPPO decomposes H2O2.

Computational
Details
All calculations have been performed using the long-range
correction33 of Becke 1988 exchange34 plus Lee–Yang–Parr correlation35 (LC-BLYP) functional (single parameter, μ
= 0.4736) with the cc-pVDZ basis set.37,38 On the basis of the experimental X-ray structure,27 we have adopted the TPPO dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules for the hydration numbers of λ = 0–3
as the calculation model (Figure 1). The small hydration numbers (λ = 0–3)
are selected to model the hydration condition near the anode of the
proton-exchange membrane fuel cell, where H2O2 molecules are produced and actively decompose the membranes under
the low humidity condition.8 Geometry optimizations
of the hydrated structures have been carried out for several initial
structures maximizing the number of hydrogen bonds. The optimum geometries
of the hydrated TPPO dimer with two H2O2 molecules
are illustrated in Figure 2. Using these optimum geometries as the initial
structures, we have optimized the geometries of the TPPO dimer + 2H2O2 models by varying the bond distance contributing
to each reaction step: O–H bond distance of H2O2 (step 1), P=O bond distance (step 2), and bridging
O–O bond distance (step 3). The Gaussian 09 suite of programs39 has been used to perform all of the LC-BLYP
calculations. All of the optimized structures have been checked to
ensure that they yield positive, real frequencies. Transition-state
calculations have been performed by the quadratic synchronous transition
method.40,41 The predictor–corrector integration
method42,43 was used to calculate the intrinsic reaction
coordinates (IRCs) of the reactions. The vibrational modes contributing
to the IR spectra and their assignments were analyzed using GaussView
5.0.8.44

Structures and Vibrational Spectra of TPPO Capturing H2O2
First, let us explore the hydration structures
of TPPO capturing H2O2 molecules for four hydration
numbers: λ = 0 through 3. As the calculation model of H2O2-adsorbed TPPO, we used an X-ray cyclic dimeric
structure, in which tricyclohexanylphosphine oxide, Cy3P=O, captures two H2O2 molecules.27Figure 2 illustrates the optimized structures of the hydration models:
TPPO dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules with
λ hydration water molecules. As shown in the figure, the H2O2 molecules make hydrogen bonds with hydrated
water molecules between the TPPO molecules. The cross-linked structure
using two H2O2 molecules is mediated by hydration
water molecules in the presence of water molecules. Note, however,
that the oxygen atoms of the phosphine oxides are attached to the
H2O2 molecules in all of these hydrated structures.
These findings suggest that the P=O group of the TPPO and hydration
water molecules may play a significant role in the decomposition of
H2O2.

Using these hydration structures,
we next calculated the vibrational spectra of the hydrated TPPO dimer
capturing the H2O2 molecules. Figure 3a displays the vibrational
spectra of the TPPO dimer before and after the binding of two H2O2 molecules with no hydration water molecule.
The figure clearly shows that the H2O2 binding
produces sharp peaks in the 3200–3500 cm–1 range. Table 1 summarizes
the peak energies and the corresponding vibrational modes of the TPPO
dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules for the hydration
numbers of λ = 0 and 3. As shown in the table, the peaks in
the 3200–3500 cm–1 range correspond to the
O–H stretching modes of the H2O2 molecules.
Note that similar broad, strong absorption peaks appear in the experimental
IR spectra of neat Bu3P=O (Bu is n-butyl group) before and after H2O2 binding
around 3217 cm–1, which are also assigned to the
O–H stretching modes.27 This indicates
that the O–H stretching modes of H2O2 molecules are activated by IR photoabsorption in the 3200–3500
cm–1 range. The source of IR photoabsorption may
be questioned. The main source of IR photoabsorption is molecular
collisions. The temperature increase heats materials. According to
classical statistical thermodynamics, a temperature upshift increases
the frequency of molecular collisions, and consequently the collisions
activate the vibrational motions of materials. In quantum mechanics,
molecular collision-induced vibrational excitations are interpreted
to transfer (IR) light (or in other words, corresponding energy) to
excite molecular vibrational eigenstates by a translation–vibration
coupling. The transition probability of the molecular collision-induced
vibrational excitations is proportional to that of the IR light-induced
excitations, that is, IR spectral peak strengths.45 Note also that there are other sources of IR light: for
example, the background photoradiation of materials and their reflections
and transmissions. Dependent only on the temperature, IR light is
known to be radiated in the range of 2.5–100 μm (100–4000
cm–1) at 300 K (room temperature). We consider that
molecular collisions and background IR photoradiation enhance the
H2O2 decomposition, as mentioned later.

Figure 3b depicts
the vibrational spectra of the TPPO dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules with zero (λ = 0) and three (λ
= 3) hydration water molecules. As shown in the figure, the hydration
of this system provides sharp peaks in the 1700–1800 and 3000–3800
cm–1 ranges. Table 1 indicates that these peaks are assigned to the scissoring
modes and antisymmetric stretching modes of hydrated water molecules,
respectively. These sharp peaks also appear after hydration in the
experimental IR spectra of neat Bu3P=O with predecomposed
H2O2 at 1647.2, 3219.2, and 3408.2 cm–1.27 This correspondence indicates that
the present model correctly reproduces the hydration structure of
this phosphine oxide, and therefore, it is appropriate to investigate
the H2O2 decomposition mechanism by TPPO.

H2O2 Decomposition Reaction Mechanism
Using
the authenticated calculation model, we next searched for the H2O2 decomposition reaction mechanism by the TPPO
dimer. As a result, we found that this reaction proceeds through the
following three steps:1 Hydrogen transfer from H2O2 to the P=O bond of TPPO: 2Ph3PO–H2O2 (MIN1) → 2Ph3P(OH)OOH (MIN2),

2 Hydrogen transfer from the
−OOH
group to the −OH group: 2Ph3P(OH)OOH (MIN2) →
2Ph3P(H2O)O2 (MIN3), and

3 O–O bond formation
between O2 groups: 2Ph3P(H2O)O2 (MIN3)
→ 2Ph3PO + O2 + 2H2O (MIN4).



Figure 4 illustrates four minima of this decomposition reaction
for the hydration
number of λ = 3. We adopted the most stable reaction paths in
the ones that were calculated, which are given in several geometry
optimizations, to specify this reaction mechanism. If OH radicals
are used as a substitute for H2O2, we will obtain
much different reaction mechanisms, with lower reaction barriers.
However, we chose reaction mechanisms, to which H2O2 directly contributes, because OH radicals require large energies
to be generated, as mentioned above. In this section, we explore the
reaction mechanisms in these three steps.

The dotted circles indicate the H2O2 molecules
and their decomposed fragments. The fixed bond distances in the optimization
of step 1 are shown in the structure of MIN1. LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ is used.

Step
1: Hydrogen Transfer from H2O2 to the P=O
Bond of TPPO
In the first step of the H2O2 decomposition reaction, that is, MIN1 → MIN2, the
oxygen atom of the P=O bond abstracts a hydrogen atom from
H2O2. Figure 5 compares the potential energy curves of the first
step for λ = 0 through 3. The horizontal axis indicates the
structural parameter ratio of MIN2. After mixing the structural parameters
of MIN1 and MIN2 at this rate, the geometries at each point on the
reaction coordinate were optimized by fixing the O–O and O–H
distances, which are shown in Figure 4. The figure shows that the dehydrated TPPO dimer provides
the lowest barrier (∼46 kcal/mol), whereas the hydrated ones
give high barriers, 56–60 kcal/mol. Note, however, that even
the barrier of the dehydrated TPPO dimer, ∼46 kcal/mol, is
too high for the decomposition reaction to proceed easily at room
temperature condition. It is interesting to compare this barrier to
that of the H2O2 decomposition reaction in water,
which is experimentally known to be 43–48 kcal/mol.30 Recently, we also calculated this barrier height
by the same method and found that it is evaluated to be 48–50
kcal/mol under hydration. The small difference between the barrier
heights seems to suggest that the contribution of the TPPO dimer to
the reactivity of the H2O2 decomposition is
not important. We should, however, note that the OH stretching modes
of H2O2 are considered to contribute to this
reaction step when attached to the TPPO dimer, whereas these modes
may be relaxed by other vibrational modes of water molecules when
hydrated in aqueous solution. As mentioned in the previous section,
this system provides sharp peaks corresponding to the O–H stretching
modes of H2O2 in the 3200–3500 cm–1 (9.2–10.0 kcal/mol) range. This indicates
that the stretching modes of the captured H2O2 molecules are activated by vibrational excitations in this region.
Note that the stretching mode of H2O2 proceeds
toward the direction of the reaction process in this step, and therefore,
enhances the reaction process through the vibrational excitations.
Although the stretching modes of H2O2 are also
activated in aquo, they are relaxed by the vibrational modes of water
molecules around H2O2. We, therefore, conclude
that this reaction step slowly proceeds by the assistance of the vibrational
excitations.

on the IRC from the reactant (MIN1) to MIN2. The dotted circles indicate
the fixed O–O and O–H bond distances. LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ
is used.

Step
2: Hydrogen Transfer from −OOH Group to the −OH Group
The second step of the H2O2 decomposition,
that is, MIN2 → MIN3, is the hydrogen transfer from the −O–OH
group to the −OH group, both of which bind to the P atom. Figure 6 plots the potential
energy curves of this step in terms of the P–O distance of
the P–OH bond for λ = 0 through 3. The geometry optimizations
were performed by fixing only the P–O distance. This figure
shows that the dehydrated TPPO dimer provides the lowest barrier with
∼27 kcal/mol, whereas the hydrated one gives a higher barrier,
30–33 kcal/mol. However, this step is not thought to be rate-determining
because of the lower barriers than those in the first step. We should
also note that this barrier estimate includes the barriers for two
molecules because this step is an intramolecular reaction. Interestingly,
this step is driven by the P–O stretching of the P–OH
group. In the vibrational spectrum of MIN2 for λ = 0 (see the Supplementary Information), a strong peak corresponding
to this stretching mode appears at 949 cm–1, with
a very strong peak corresponding to the O–H stretching of the
P–OH group at 2697 cm–1, which supports the
backward process toward MIN1 in step 1. This suggests that vibrational
excitations also induce this step to proceed, although it simultaneously
activates the backward process of step 1. Furthermore, the vibrational
spectrum of MIN3 for λ = 0 (see the Supplementary Information) gives a strong peak corresponding to the OH stretching
of H2O, which supports the backward process of step 2 at
3069, 3516, and 3810 cm–1. We, therefore, propose
that the vibrational excitations activate this step for both forward
and backward processes, as well as step 1.

→ 2Ph3P(H2O)OO, with respect to the P–O
distance of the P–OH bond. The dotted circles indicate the
fixed P–O bond distances. LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ is used.

Step
3: O–O Bond Formation between O2 Groups
In the third step, an O2 molecule is formed from two O2 molecules attached to the P atoms of MIN3 to regenerate the
TPPO dimer: MIN3 → MIN4. Note that the H2O2 decomposition can be interpreted to be terminated in step 2 because
oxygen and water molecules are already produced in this step. Although
this interpretation is surely acceptable, the H2O2 decomposition is not a catalytic reaction in this case because it
does not regenerate the TPPO dimer, probably in contradiction to the
experimental results. Since the O2 molecules attached to
the P atoms are radicals in MIN3, they are considered to form an O2 molecule rapidly when approaching each other. The reaction
barrier of this step is, therefore, the energy required to bring two
O2 molecules together. Figure 7 depicts the potential energy curves of step
3 with respect to the O–O distance between two O2 molecules attached to the P atoms of the TPPO dimer. As shown in
the figure, two reaction paths are obtained for this step: one path
directly produces an O2 molecule (path 1) and the other
path forms an HOOOH molecule before producing an O2 molecule
(path 2).

indicate the fixed O–O bond distances. LC-BLYP/cc-pVDZ is used.

For path 1, the systems of small
hydration numbers (λ = 0
and 1) provide lower barriers than those of large hydration numbers
(λ = 2 and 3): the barrier height energies are less than 15
kcal/mol for the former, whereas they are 25–30 kcal/mol for
the latter. Since the barrier heights of the former are much lower
than those in step 1 and 2, step 3 may naturally proceed under dehydrated
conditions. The reaction energies also tend to be large for the small
hydration numbers: they are 64.5, 56.1, 44.5, and 49.3 kcal/mol for
λ = 0 through 3, respectively. We, therefore, conclude that,
similar to step 1 and 2, step 3 rapidly proceeds under the dehydrated
condition, whereas it proceeds slowly under the hydrated condition.

The second path proceeds via the production of an HOOOH molecule.
The potential energy curves of this path intersect with those of path
1 in decreasing the O–O bond distance between two O2 molecules and have a minima at an O–O bond distance of about
2.2 Å. We consider that a significant proportion of this step
falls into the potential well of this path, producing an HOOOH molecule.
Therefore, we also explored the subsequent reaction process after
which the HOOOH production would proceed. Figure 8 illustrates the decomposition reaction potential
energy curve of HOOOH by two water molecules to O2 + H2O on the normalized IRC. The figure shows that this decomposition
reaction requires only less than 10 kcal/mol to proceed. This indicates
that HOOOH is easily decomposed under the hydrated condition. Being
different from steps 1 and 2, step 3 is not enhanced by vibrational
excitations because MIN3 provides no sharp peaks corresponding to
the O–O stretching modes. We therefore suppose that the HOOOH
production may be an alternative path for step 3 because it requires
a very small barrier to proceed.

set to be zero.

Overall
Mechanism of TPPO-Induced H2O2 Decomposition
Reaction
Finally, let us clarify the overall picture of the
H2O2 decomposition reaction mechanism for steps
1 through 3. Figure 9 integrates the reaction potential energy curves and schematic diagrams
of these steps. The figure shows high reaction barriers and small
(or negative) reaction energies as a whole. Actually, the reaction
barrier energies were evaluated to be about 71, 84, 78, and 79 kcal/mol,
and the reaction energies are given to be 1.0, −3.8, −4.7,
and −2.7 kcal/mol for λ = 0 through 3, respectively.
This seems to suggest that the TPPO-induced H2O2 decomposition reaction is very slow. However, the results also indicate
that the first and second steps are activated by vibrational excitations,
and the third step has two paths giving very low barrier heights,
as mentioned above. Moreover, even the highest barriers of step 1
in this reaction are lower than those of the H2O2 decomposition reaction in aquo without any catalyst such as a metal
ion. We therefore consider that this decomposition reaction proceeds
faster than it appears in the potential energy curves.

is used. The IRCs are normalized for each reaction step.

The present results also clarify some features
of TPPO. The reaction
mechanism shows that the H2O2 decomposition
uses the violation of the octet rule, that is, the P atom of TPPO
forms five bonds in the reaction process. As mentioned in the introduction,
it has been discussed whether the P=O double bond is an ionic
bond satisfying the octet rule or not. This reaction mechanism indicates
that the P atom of TPPO clearly violates the octet rule, and the P=O
bond is, therefore, not ionic. Furthermore, this result explains the
reason as to why H2O2 molecules strongly bind
to the P=O double bond. The H2O2 molecules
and the P=O bond exchange hydrogen atoms through the O–H
stretching modes that have high vibrational excitation probabilities.
Therefore, TPPO is useful as an inhibitor for chemical attack by H2O2 because of the strong adsorption ability, even
if the decomposition reaction would be slow.

Conclusions
In this study, we have theoretically investigated the decomposition
mechanism of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, by TPPO,
which is often incorporated in the proton-exchange membranes for fuel
cells. As a result, by reference to an experimental study, we found
a decomposition reaction mechanism, which uses the TPPO dimer and
is activated by the vibrational excitations in the initial processes.

On the basis of the experimental X-ray spectrum analysis,27 we first determined the hydration structures
of the TPPO dimer capturing two H2O2 molecules
for the hydration numbers of λ = 0 through 3. We calculated
the vibrational spectra of these hydrated systems and found that the
vibrational spectra accurately provide sharp peaks corresponding to
the vibrational modes of H2O2 and H2O attached to the TPPO dimer, and therefore, the calculational models
are considered to be correct.

We next explored the H2O2 decomposition reaction
mechanism of the TPPO dimer, using the authenticated models. Consequently,
we found that this decomposition reaction proceeds through three steps:
(1) hydrogen transfer from H2O2 to the P=O
bond of TPPO, (2) hydrogen transfer from the −OOH group to
the −OH group, and (3) O–O bond formation between O2 groups. For the first and second steps, we revealed that
the reactions are activated by vibrational excitations because of
the sharp peaks corresponding to the vibrational modes, enhancing
the reaction rates for these steps for both forward and backward processes.
The decomposition reaction was shown to proceed at a higher rate under
dehydrated condition than that under hydrated conditions. We also
found that the third step provides two reaction paths: one directly
produces an O2 molecule and the other forms HOOOH prior
to the O2 production. For both paths, we obtained low barrier
heights, indicating the smooth progress of the reactions.

In
conclusion, we proposed a TPPO-induced H2O2 decomposition
mechanism activated by vibrational excitations. This
reaction mechanism makes use of the violation of the octet rule and
the resulting strong H2O2 binding to the P=O
double bond. We expect that this study will lead to the development
of a new catalyst for H2O2 decomposition.
