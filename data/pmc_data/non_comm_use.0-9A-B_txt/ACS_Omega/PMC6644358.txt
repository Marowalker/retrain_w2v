Layered double hydroxides
(LDHs), a category of two-dimensional
nanostructured layered materials, can be employed widely as supports,
catalyst precursors, and actual catalysts in a variety of heterogeneous
catalytic reactions. In this work, we reported a series of Fe-containing
LDHs-supported Pt-based catalysts for base-free selective hydrogenation
of cinnamaldehyde into cinnamyl alcohol. It was revealed that their
catalytic performances were closely correlated to the compositions
of LDH supports. Especially, highly selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde
could be achieved over the Fe(II)–Fe(III)-LDH (green rust,
FeFe-LDH) supported Pt catalyst, with a high cinnamyl alcohol selectivity
of about 92% at a conversion of 90% after a reaction of 2 h, superior
to other Fe(III)-containing LDHs (e.g., NiFe-LDH, CoFe-LDH, and ZnFe-LDH)
supported Pt ones. It was demonstrated that the high catalytic efficiency
of Pt/FeFe-LDH mainly originated from highly electron-rich character
of metallic Pt species and the presence of surface reductive Fe2+ species, thereby being helpful for the chemisorption and
activation of carbonyl group in cinnamaldehyde. Moreover, strong interactions
between green rust matrix and metallic Pt species could stabilize
the surface Pt nanoparticles, thereby inhibiting the metal leaching
during the above reaction. The present study illustrates the validity
of support control in supported Pt catalysts via tuning the compositions
of LDHs, and thus the electronic structure of active metal sites and
catalytic performance in the selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde.

Introduction
As we know, layered double hydroxides
(LDHs, [M1–x2+Mx3+ (OH)2][An–]x/n·yH2O), a family of two-dimensional
(2D) layered anionic materials,1,2 are composed of brucite-type
octahedral hydroxide layers and various
interlayer charge-balancing anions.3 In
the structure of LDHs, divalent and trivalent metal cations uniformly
distribute on the brucite-like layers at an atomic level. Of late,
this kind of low-cost LDH materials have gained more and more attention
because their diverse compositions and flexible microstructures can
make them suitable catalyst precursors and actual catalysts in a wide
range of heterogeneous catalytic processes.4−6 At present,
there is increasing interest in developing NiFe-, CoFe-, and NiCo-LDHs
as high-performing electrocatalysts for water oxidation,7−12 thanks to unique redox properties of metal cations within the brucite-like
layers. More importantly, 2D LDH materials possess promising potentials
as excellent catalyst supports for the stabilization of metal nanoparticles
(NPs) by the virtue of several advantages of easy synthesis, favorable
surface basicity, high specific areas, and large adsorption capacity,13,14 as well as surface confinement effects of LDHs-derived catalysts.15,16 Correspondingly, via smart design of LDH supports in terms of compositions,
surface properties and structures, as well as the control over the
size of metal particles, resultant supported metal catalysts could
exhibit significantly enhanced catalytic performances.17−20 Furthermore, transition metal cations (e.g., Ni, Cr) on the brucite-like
layers are believed to be able to enhance the metal–support
synergy.21,22

Presently, as one of the most important
chemical processes, selective
hydrogenations of α,β-unsaturated aldehydes have attracted
tremendous concern because corresponding unsaturated allylic alcohols
(UAAs) can be widely utilized as industrially important intermediates
to produce various highly valuable perfumes, pharmaceuticals, food
additives, and so on.23−25 Due to the higher activation barrier for the reduction
of C=O bond than that for the reduction of conjugated C=C
bond,26−28 the production of UAAs still is challenging from
the point of view of thermodynamics. Therefore, various attempts have
been made to enhance both activity and selectivity toward the C=O
bond reduction. So far, numerous explorations have manifested that
noble-metal catalysts (i.e., Pd, Pt, Ru, and Au) presented certain
potential in the above reactions. Especially, noble metal Pt27,29−35 and bimetallic Pt–M (M = Cu, Co, Fe, or Sn)36−39 catalysts remarkably outperform the others, in some cases with the
aid of excess amounts of additional bases, like NaOH, because Pt has
large d-band with repulsive electrons, which results in strong interaction
with the C=O bond rather than the C=C bond. In most
cases, the simultaneous achievement of both high activity and high
selectivity to UAAs still is not satisfactory. Thus, more and more
researchers are focusing on the development of high-performing selective
catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity to UAAs.

On the
other hand, as we know, catalyst support also can greatly
affect the electronic and geometric structures of the surface active
sites and thus the catalytic performances of the catalysts, in addition
to catalytically active compositions. Recently, we and other research
group have found that for LDHs-supported Pt catalysts, delicately
turning metal particle sizes or adjusting compositions of LDH supports
could improve the selectivity toward UAAs in the hydrogenation of
cinnamaldehyde (CAL) with the carbonyl group and conjugated C=C
double bonds into cinnamyl alcohol (COL),29,30 despite moderate catalytic activities. Nevertheless, fundamental
insight and knowledge of the effect of metal species in LDHs on the
catalytic performance of the catalysts is not clear, which greatly
restricts the design and development of more highly active and selective
metal catalysts.

Herein, by combining the structural features
of Fe-containing LDHs
and favorable interactions of metallic Pt species and LDH supports,
a new Fe(II)–Fe(III)-LDH (namely green rust, FeFe-LDH) supported
Pt catalyst was synthesized and successfully employed in the base-free
highly selective CAL hydrogenation into COL. For comparison, several
other Fe(III)-containing LDHs (i.e., CoFe-LDH, ZnFe-LDH, and NiFe-LDH)
supported Pt ones also were synthesized and the related reactions
were examined. It was found that the as-formed Pt/FeFe-LDH was superior
to other Pt catalysts in terms of the selectivity to the C=O
reduction and afforded a high cinnamyl alcohol selectivity of about
92% at a conversion of 90.0% after a reaction of 2 h. Furthermore,
the effect of support compositions on the electronic state of Pt species
and the catalytic behaviors of catalysts were clearly demonstrated.
In the present work, the use of green rust as catalyst support was
shown to be crucial for the realization of high catalytic efficiency
of Pt-based catalysts in the CAL hydrogenation to produce COL. To
the best of our knowledge, the present effective and selective Pt/FeFe-LDH
catalyst has not yet been reported for the above reaction.

Results
and Discussion
Structural Analysis of Samples
Figure 1 presents the X-ray
diffraction (XRD) patterns
of different LDHs-supported Pt-based samples. In all the cases, typical
characteristic (003), (006), (110), and/or (113) planes of hydrotalcite-like
phase can be found.3 Noticeably, for Pt/FeFe-LDH
and Pt/ZnFe-LDH samples, two diffractions appearing at lower 2θ
angles of about 8.1 and 10.0° correspond to the basal spacings
of about 1.0 and 0.88 nm, respectively, reflecting the presence of
interlayer sulfate anions. Compared to that for Pt/FeFe-LDH, the decreased
basal spacing for Pt/ZnFe-LDH demonstrate that less crystal water
may coexist in the interlayer domains. However, the diffraction at
about 11.5° for Pt/NiFe-LDH and Pt/CoFe-LDH illustrates the formation
of carbonate-intercalated LDH phases. Interestingly, we do not find
any diffractions belonging to metallic platinum phase in all cases,
owing to the low content of small-sized and highly dispersive Pt particles
on the surface of the LDH supports.

(b), Pt/NiFe-LDH (c),
and Pt/CoFe-LDH (d) samples.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the SEM observations reveal a similar platelet-like
morphology
of four supported Pt samples. In two cases of Pt/FeFe-LDH and Pt/ZnFe-LDH
samples, especially, uniform and large LDH nanosheets with thickness
of about 20 nm interlace each other to generate a three-dimensional
honeycomb-like morphology, and no collapse and agglomeration of nanosheets
are observed. By contrast, both Pt/NiFe-LDH and Pt/CoFe-LDH are composed
of smaller hexagonal nanoplatelets, and the obvious agglomeration
of LDH platelets can be observed. N2 adsorption–desorption
experiments demonstrate that Pt/FeFe-LDH possesses a larger specific
surface area of 72 m2/g than other supported samples (Table 1) as the result of
its regular and small nanosheet-like structure without agglomeration.

The TEM and high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images of
the supported
Pt samples are presented in Figure 3. It may be clearly noted that large quantities of
tiny Pt NPs with the diameter size of about 3–4 nm are highly
dispersed on the surface of Pt/FeFe-LDH without any aggregates of
large particles. Further, a HRTEM image of single Pt particle over
the Pt/FeFe-LDH validates the clear lattice fringes, which correspond
to the interplanar spacing of about 0.226 nm for the (111) plane of
metallic Pt0 phase. Based on more than 200 NPs over the
Pt/FeFe-LDH, the average size of Pt NPs is measured to be about 3.4
nm (Table 1). However,
a few aggregates of large black NPs can be found in the cases of Pt/NiFe-LDH
and Pt/CoFe-LDH samples, probably implying the weakened interaction
between Pt species and LDH supports. As listed in Table 1, noticeably, Pt NPs on other
LDH supports have a similar size to that on the FeFe-LDH, regardless
of the presence of some agglomerates.

(b), Pt/NiFe-LDH (c),
and Pt/CoFe-LDH (d) samples. The inset in (a) shows the HRTEM image
of a single particle.

As for supported metal catalysts, the electronic structure
of active
metal species always plays an important role in governing the catalytic
performances of the catalysts. As shown in Figure 4, in the fine Pt 4f spectra, there are two
spin–orbit components of Pt 4f7/2 and Pt 4f5/2 core levels located in the ranges of about 69.8–70.6
and 73.0–73.6 eV, respectively, indicative of the presence
of metallic Pt0 species.41,42 Except for
Pt/CoFe-LDH, other supported Pt samples present another two pairs
of doublets at 71.3–71.7 and 74.5–74.9 eV, respectively,
indicative of the presence of Pt(II) species.42 As summarized in Table 1, the high proportions of metallic Pt0 species
on samples illustrate the reduction of most Pt(IV) species, and a
small part of Pt2+ species probably anchor with surface
oxygen of LDH supports through surface hydrogen vacancies on the brucite-like
layers to form M–O–Pt2+ like structure (M
= Fe2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, or Zn2+), thereby forming stable Pt(II) species.43 More interestingly, a gradual shift in Pt 4f peaks for Pt0 species to lower binding energies from Pt/CoFe-LDH to Pt/NiFe-LDH,
Pt/ZnFe-LDH, and Pt/FeFe-LDH is observed, indicative of enhanced electronic
interactions between Pt0 species and LDH supports. Correspondingly,
the strongest metal–support interaction in the Pt/FeFe-LDH
can result in the generation of highly electron-rich Pt0 species.

Catalytic Performance of Different Pt Catalysts
It
is well known that during the liquid-phase selective CAL hydrogenation,
several products can be generated. The single hydrogenation of the
C=O group can produce COL, whereas the single reduction of
the C=C group generates hydrocinnamaldehyde (HCAL). Further,
COL or HCAL is hydrogenated to form the final hydrocinnamyl alcohol
(HCOL) product. In addition, small amounts of acetals may be produced
through the aldol condensation in some cases. Here, we studied the
effect of the nature of LDH supports on the reactivity of Pt NPs on
different Fe-containing LDH supports in selective CAL hydrogenation.

Liquid-phase CAL hydrogenations were conducted over different LDHs-supported
Pt catalysts at 110 °C and 1.0 MPa hydrogen pressure. And, blank
reactions were performed to evaluate the performance of four pure
LDH supports. It is found that all supports are inactive for the present
reactions under the same reaction condition as that for Pt-based catalysts.
As presented in Figure 5, the nature of LDH supports plays a significant role in governing
CAL conversions and product selectivities. In our case, acetals and
other byproducts derived from decarbonylation or cracking cannot be
detected. It is noteworthy that Pt/FeFe-LDH catalyst affords a high
COL selectivity of 92% at a CAL conversion of 90% after a reaction
of 2 h, indicative of a preferential reduction of the C=O bond
in CAL. When other LDHs-supported Pt catalysts are employed, the COL
selectivity is found to decrease progressively to 75% for Pt/ZnFe-LDH,
32% for Pt/NiFe-LDH, and only about 1% for Pt/CoFe-LDH after 2 h,
accompanied by greatly increased HCOL selectivities. Especially, over
the Pt/CoFe-LDH, a 99% yield of HCOL is achieved after 2 h, along
with the inferior COL selectivity in the whole reaction period due
to fast and simultaneous hydrogenation of the C=C and C=O
bonds in CAL, which is ascribed to the stronger adsorption of CAL
on the surface, as evidenced by the IR spectrum of CAL adsorption
(see the following part). Moreover, based on the catalytic results
over these tested catalysts after 1.5 h (Table 2), Pt/FeFe-LDH remarkably outperforms the
other three Pt-based catalysts in terms of the COL selectivity. Comparatively
speaking, Pt/CoFe-LDH delivers a highest CAL conversion. And, it is
noted that despite different experimental conditions, the present
Pt/FeFe-LDH catalyst achieves a higher or comparable COL yield, as
well as the turnover frequency (TOF), compared to most of the other
previously reported Pt-based catalysts in the literature (Table 3).27,29,41,44−46

Figure 6A presents
the effect of reaction temperature on the CAL hydrogenation over the
Pt/FeFe-LDH after a reaction of 2 h. It is found that the conversion
rapidly raises from 12 to 90% when the reaction temperature is elevated
from 90 to 110 °C, along with a slightly increased COL selectivity.
However, further increase in the reaction temperature causes a decline
in the COL selectivity. Noticeably, the hydrogen partial pressure
also can affect the CAL hydrogenation (Figure 6B). With the hydrogen pressure raising from
0.5 to 1.0 MPa, the conversion dramatically increases from 46 to 90%
with the slightly increased COL selectivity by about 2%. The higher
hydrogen pressure can facilitate the hydrogen solubility, making more
hydrogen molecules accessible in the reaction medium. Correspondingly,
more hydrogen molecules can get access to active metal sites and thus
are dissociated into more active hydrogen species, thereby accelerating
the rate of the hydrogenation of the C=O bond in CAL and HCAL
intermediates. Further increase in the hydrogen pressure results in
a slight decrease in the COL selectivity, besides a slightly increased
conversion, mainly due to the nearly saturated solubility of hydrogen.

(A) and hydrogen pressure (B) in the CAL hydrogenation over the Pt/FeFe-LDH

(B) 110 °C.

Further, the stability
and reusability of Pt/FeFe-LDH was evaluated
through five successive cycles. After the reaction, the catalyst could
be recovered by centrifugation, washing with ethanol, and drying under
vacuum at room temperature. As illustrated in Figure 7, the CAL conversion is only decreased by
about 4% after five consecutive runs, along with almost unchanged
COL selectivity, indicative of no significant loss in the catalytic
performance. Further, the reaction filtrate was analyzed by ICP-AES
after five cycles. It is revealed that no obvious leaching of active
Pt species can be observed. In addition, TEM image of the used Pt/FeFe-LDH
catalyst (not shown) reveals that the size of Pt NPs does not change
significantly after five runs. However, the relatively weak interactions
between Pt species and ZnFe-LDH matrix is conductive to a rapid decline
in the catalytic performance after three runs in terms to both the
conversion and the COL selectivity (Figure 7) due to the Pt leaching during the reaction.
It is speculated that in the case of Pt/FeFe-LDH, surface reductive
Fe2+ species as electron donors may enhance the interactions
between Fe2+ cations and Pt0 species through
the Pt–O–Fe2+ structures, thereby stabilizing
the surface Pt species on the FeFe-LDH to a large extent and preventing
Pt NPs from aggregating and inhibiting the metal leaching during the
above reaction, in comparison with metallic Pt NPs on other Fe(II)-free
LDH supports. This is our hypothesis for the main origin of enhanced
stability of Pt/FeFe-LDH. Nevertheless, further investigation of the
improved stability of Pt/FeFe-LDH needs to be explored through experimental
or theoretical methods in the future. It is expected that green rust
material would be a promising catalyst support for immobilizing other
metallic nanoparticles to enhance the metal–support interactions.

Catalytic Mechanism for
the CAL Hydrogenation
Previously,
it was reported that the particle size of active metals could affect
their catalytic performance of catalysts in the hydrogenations of
α,β-unsaturated aldehydes.47,48 That is to
say, the smaller the metal particle size, the higher the activity
and lower the UAAs selectivity. This is because small metal particles
possess more active sites and stronger adsorption for the C=C
group than the C=O one. The average size of Pt NPs in the present
LDHs-supported Pt catalysts is almost equal, suggesting that surface
electronic structure of catalysts should be a key factor in controlling
the catalytic performances of the catalysts.

To gain insights
into the catalytic mechanism on the CAL hydrogenation, in situ IR
spectra of CO adsorption over LDHs-supported Pt catalysts were analyzed
(Figure 8). It is noted
that there is a broad absorption in the range of 2075–1975
cm–1 in each case, which is attributable to the
C=O bond vibration originating from a linearly bound CO to
a metallic Pt atom.49 No significant adsorption
for CO bridging on several Pt atoms can be detected in the range 1900–1780
cm–1. Especially, for Pt/FeFe-LDH, there are two
splitting peaks in the range 2075–1975 cm–1, probably originating from different surface adsorption of CO on
two kinds of surface Pt0 species. The above results illustrate
that CO molecule mainly shows a preferential linear adsorption on
the Pt0 sites. Compared with those over other supported
samples, the absorption intensity of C=O vibration over Pt/FeFe-LDH
and Pt/ZnFe-LDH samples is significantly enhanced. Moreover, it is
worth noting that the C=O absorption gradually shifts to lower
wavenumbers from Pt/CoFe-LDH to Pt/NiFe-LDH, Pt/ZnFe-LDH, and Pt/FeFe-LDH.
Such a vibration frequency shift behavior can be attributed to the
fact that the electron-rich Pt0 species are more helpful
for the enhancement of back-bonding formed between the π*-orbital
in the CO molecule and the Pt0 sites.

Figure 8 In situ IR spectra of
CO adsorption over Pt/FeFe-LDH (a), Pt/ZnFe-LDH
(b), Pt/NiFe-LDH (c), and Pt/CoFe-LDH (d) catalysts at room temperature.

Additionally, the IR spectra of
CAL adsorption on different LDHs-supported
Pt samples were recorded to understand the adsorption behavior of
CAL (Figure 9), although
measurement conditions are different from the actual reaction conditions.
In the case of Pt/CoFe-LDH, two broad absorption bands appear at about
1681 and 1631 cm–1, respectively, which are ascribed
to the asymmetric C=O and C=C stretching vibrations
for adsorbed CAL molecule.50,51 Interestingly, with
the change in LDH supports from CoFe-LDH to NiFe-LDH, ZnFe-LDH, and
FeFe-LDH, the C=O vibration gradually shifts to higher frequencies
from 1631 to 1639 cm–1, whereas the C=C vibration
exhibits an inverse trend from 1681 to 1673 cm–1. Here, the nature of Pt species and LDH supports should be a critical
factor affecting the CAL adsorption. For Pt/FeFe-LDH, the greatly
decreased absorption frequency for the C=O vibration should
be correlated with stronger interactions between electron-rich Pt0 species and the carbonyl group in CAL through back-bonding
of π*C=O with Pt species. Meanwhile, surface
reductive Fe2+ species as electron donors can enhance the
electron transfer from FeFe-LDH to active Pt sites, which leads to
the electronic repulsion of the Pt0 species to the C=C
bond in CAL, thus causing the increased frequency of the C=C
double-bond vibration. On the other hand, previously, it was reported
that the higher proportion of surface metallic Pt0 species
on other Pt-based catalysts was favorable for higher COL selectivity
in the hydrogenation of CAL.42,52 On the contrary, in
our case, Pt/FeFe-LDH with the lower percentage of Pt0 species
delivers a higher COL selectivity, implying that the amount of surface
Pt0 species is not a key factor governing the selectivities
of the products in the present Pt/LDH catalytic system. As a result,
compared with other supported Pt ones, Pt/FeFe-LDH can more easily
activate the carbonyl group in CAL and reduce the probability of C=C
bond coordinated to active metal sites, which should be favorable
for the selective reduction of carbonyl group during the CAL hydrogenation.

Figure 9 IR spectra
for CAL adsorption over Pt/FeFe-LDH (a), Pt/ZnFe-LDH
(b), Pt/NiFe-LDH (c), and Pt/CoFe-LDH (d) catalysts.

The above results also demonstrate that the instinctive
catalytic
activity of Pt/NiFe-LDH and Pt/CoFe-LDH catalysts based on the TOF
values are higher than that of Pt/FeFe-LDH (Table 2), but the COL selectivities obtained is
much smaller than that over the Pt/FeFe-LDH. This is primarily due
to the relatively higher proportions of Pt0 species in
total Pt species on Pt/NiFe-LDH and Pt/CoFe-LDH, which are favorable
for the hydrogen dissociation into active hydrogen species. In addition,
compared with other Pt-based samples, the greatly enhanced CAL adsorption
on the Pt/CoFe-LDH can further promote the CAL hydrogenation, in good
agreement with the reactivity evaluation results.

Based on the
above structural characterization and catalytic results,
the following factors can account for its superior catalytic performance
of Pt/FeFe-LDH in terms of the COL selectivity to other supported
Pt ones.

First, the XPS analysis reveals that Pt 4f7/2 and Pt
4f5/2 peaks of Pt NPs shift to lower binding energies after
immobilizing on the FeFe-LDH support, indicative of negatively charged
nature of Pt0 NPs. It is generally believed that CAL may
absorb on the catalyst surface via two paths, the planar geometry
through the C=C bond and the vertical C=O atop geometry,53 thereby producing COL and HCAL, respectively.
In the case of the present Pt/FeFe-LDH, according to in situ IR of
CO adsorption and IR for CAL adsorption results, the absorbed CAL
should preferentially exist in the form of the vertical C=O
atop geometry through the interaction of the back-bonding of π*C=O with negatively charged Pt0 species,
which is different from the interaction between the carbonyl group
and surface Al3+ sites in the previously reported Pt/CoAl
mixed metal oxide catalyst system,53 and
thus the carbonyl group can be more easily activated in the selective
hydrogenation of CAL54 in comparison with
the C=C double bond.

Second, surface reductive Fe2+ species as electron donors
can interact with the oxygen atom of the C=O group in CAL to
weaken the C=O bond to a large extent. Correspondingly, it
can be speculated that Fe2+ species are most likely to
be oxidized to form Fe3+ species, whereas the C=O
bond can convert into a C–O σ-bond. Such configurations
between CAL and electron-rich Pt0 or Fe2+ species
significantly enhance the selective chemisorption of CAL, thereby
spatially constructing an electron-transfer channel for activating
the C=O bond and the dramatical decrease in the barrier for
the reduction of carbonyl group by dissociative hydrogen on Pt0 species.

Third, negatively charged Pt0 NPs
also can promote the
desorption of electron-rich olefin group in COL. As a result, for
Pt/FeFe-LDH catalyst, both electron-rich Pt0 species and
surface reductive Fe2+ species can greatly enhance the
carbonyl group activation, resulting in an impressive catalytic efficiency
in the CAL hydrogenation into COL.

Conclusions
In
summary, a new green-rust-supported Pt catalyst was synthesized
for the selective hydrogenation of CAL into COL. It was found that
as-formed Pt catalyst afforded a higher COL selectivity of 91% at
90% CAL conversion, in comparison with other Fe-containing LDHs-supported
Pt ones. In situ IR spectra of the CO adsorption results confirmed
the difference in surface electronic structure of active Pt species
in different LDHs-supported Pt samples, whereas the IR spectra of
CAL adsorption results showed that Pt/FeFe-LDH could more easily activate
the carbonyl group in CAL and reduce the probability of C=C
bond coordinated to active metal sites. The introduction of Fe2+ into the brucite-like layers of LDHs could promote the interactions
between Pt species and the LDH matrix, thus forming surface electron-rich
Pt0 species. In the present Pt/FeFe-LDH catalytic system,
favorable chemical state of Pt0 species, as well as the
presence of reductive Fe2+ ions, significantly induced
the promoted activation of the carbonyl group in CAL. Compared with
other Fe-containing LDH supports, FeFe-LDH enabled Pt species to be
more tightly immobilize on the surface due to a stronger Pt-LDH interaction,
thus leading to a good reusability of the catalyst. The enhanced catalytic
performance of Pt/FeFe-LDH highlights the importance of precise design
of LDH supports with desirable compositions. It is expected that such
an effect of green rust support may be a promising approach for designing
other highly active supported metal catalysts applied in various heterogeneous
catalytic processes.

Experimental Section
Preparation of Samples
FeFe-LDH
A salt solution containing FeSO4·7H2O (0.08 mol) and Fe2(SO4)3 (0.04
mol) in 100 mL of decarbonated deionized water
was prepared. Then, a base solution of NaOH (2.0 M) was slowly dropped
into the above salt solution at 40 °C under nitrogen until pH
= 7.0. Subsequently, the resulting suspension was aged for 2 h, and
the reaction solution was cooled in ice water. The filtered precipitate
was washed with decarbonated deionized ice water and ethanol for three
times. Finally, the obtained FeFe-LDH sample was dried under vacuum.

CoFe-LDH and NiFe-LDH
A salt solution containing Co(NO3)2·6H2O (or Ni(NO3)2·6H2O) (0.08 mol) and Fe2(SO4)3 (0.04 mol) in 100 mL of deionized water was
prepared. Then, a base solution containing NaOH and Na2CO3 ([OH–] = 1.6[M2+] + [Fe3+] and [CO32–] = 2[Fe3+]) was slowly dropped into above salt solution at 40 °C until
pH = 10.0. Subsequently, the resulting suspension was aged for 12
h, and the precipitate was filtered, washed with deionized water,
and finally dried at 70 °C overnight to obtain NiFe-LDH or CoFe-LDH
support.

ZnFe-LDH
ZnFe-LDH was synthesized
according to our
developed method.55 A salt solution containing
ZnSO4·7H2O (0.08 mol) and FeSO4·7H2O (0.04 mol) in 100 mL of deionized water was
prepared. Then, a base solution of NaOH (2.0 M) was slowly dropped
into the above salt solution at 40 °C under a flow of air until
pH = 7.0. Subsequently, the resulting suspension was aged for 24 h,
filtered, washed, and dried at 70 °C for 12 h to obtain a pale-yellow
ZnFe-LDH solid.

Supported Pt Catalysts
All supported
Pt samples were
prepared by a sol-immobilization method. First, a solution containing
poly (N-vinyl-2-pyrrolidone) (0.02 g) and H2PtCl6·6H2O (0.04 g) dissolved in 25 mL
of deionized water was vigorously stirred for 20 min. Subsequently,
25 mL of NaBH4 aqueous solution (NaBH4/Pt molar
ratio = 20:1) was dropped rapidly into the above solution at room
temperature. The obtained suspension was stirred for 7 h to obtain
sol particles of Pt. Afterward, the LDH support (0.5 g) was added
into the suspension and stirred for 2 h. Finally, the obtained solid
was washed with deionized water and dried under vacuum.

Characterization
Shimadzu XRD-6000 diffractometer was
employed to gain X-ray diffraction (XRD) data at a Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm). The content of Pt in samples was determined
using Shimadzu ICPS-7500 inductively coupled plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (ICP-AES). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements
was carried out on a Supra 55 electron microscopies, whereas transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) measurements were performed on a JEOL JEM-2010
electron microscope. Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms
of the samples were collected using a Micromeritics ASAP 2020 sorptometer
apparatus. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) analysis was carried
out on VG ESCALAB 2201 XL spectrometer with an Al Kα X-ray radiation
of 1486.6 eV. The C 1s core level (284.6 eV) was utilized to calibrate
the binding energy. In situ Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) of
CO adsorbed on samples were characterized on a FT-IR instrument spectrophotometer
(Thermo Nicolet 380). First, a self-supporting sample wafer (100 mg)
was put into an IR cell and heated to 70 °C under N2 and held for 1 h. Afterward, pure CO (10 mL/min) was switched into
the cell at room temperature. Finally, IR spectra of CO adsorption
were obtained under vacuum. IR spectra of CAL adsorption were collected
on the identical FT-IR instrument. The self-supporting sample wafer
(50 mg) was first dried at 70 °C under vacuum for 12 h, soaked
in CAL for 24 h, and then dried at 25 °C overnight under vacuum.
After the wafer was purged with He for 4 h, IR spectra of CAL adsorption
were recorded.

Selective Hydrogenation Tests
Liquid-phase
CAL hydrogenation
of CAL was performed in a stainless-steel autoclave reactor (50 mL),
where the catalyst (0.03 g), CAL (4.0 mmol), and isopropanol (10 mL)
were charged. In a magnified experiment, the catalyst (0.3 g), CAL
(5 mL), and isopropanol (100 mL) were charged into an autoclave reactor
(150 mL). After that, the reactor was charged with nitrogen for three
times and then the reactor was heated to a certain temperature in
an oil bath under atmospheric pressure. Subsequently, the reactor
was purged with H2 and pressurized to 1.0 MPa. Finally,
the hydrogenation was initiated when the stirring began at a speed
of 900 rpm. In the above process, the external mass transfer limitation
was negligible. The final liquid products were analyzed on an Agilent
GC7890B gas chromatograph equipped with HP-5 capillary column and
flame ionization detector. The internal standard was benzyl alcohol.
