Priming improves the seed germination rate and grain
yield. Before
this work was executed, little, if any, research has been reported
on priming wheat for improving its nutritional properties. The impact
of hydro-priming and osmo-priming using solutions with different water
potentials on selected hydrolytic enzyme activities and their breakdown
of starch, cell wall materials, and phytates during subsequent sprouting
was studied here. A higher germination rate in the early growth stage
of seedlings was found for hydro-primed or osmo-primed (−0.3,
−0.6 MPa) grains. Hydro-primed sprouted grains had the longest
radicles and coleoptiles and the highest hydrolytic enzyme activities.
The latter lead to a 90% increase in reducing sugar, a 20% increase
in water-extractable arabinoxylan, and an 8% decrease in phytate contents
after 5 days of sprouting. This study thus offers opportunities for
optimizing agricultural practice. The presence of different plant
hormones and their concentrations are generally not affected by priming.
However, the plant hormone concentrations in grains primed at −1.2
MPa and subsequently sprouted were lower than those in all other samples
under study. The induction of too high osmotic stresses in these grains
leads to disruption of the sprouting processes. Finally, it was for
the first time found, based on the known biosynthesis pathways of
wheat, that gibberellic acid (GA)20-oxidase in (primed) sprouted wheat
is more active than GA3-oxidase and much more active than GA13-oxidase.

1 Introduction
Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germination
initiates seedling growth and proceeds once adequate temperature and
moisture content have been reached and dormancy is broken. Grains
first need to absorb water to activate their metabolism and increase
their respiration for embryo growth.1 During
germination/sprouting of grains, three phases can be distinguished,
which are related to the uptake of water.2 Phase I is characterized by rapid water uptake. This initiates the
metabolism: DNA and mitochondria repair occur together with the synthesis
of proteins using existing mRNA. During phase II, further water uptake
is limited as the grain water potential is in near equilibrium with
that of its surrounding environment. This phase is also called the
activation or lag phase. In this phase, major metabolic changes take
place, such as hydrolytic enzyme (for example α-amylase, endoxylanase,
and phytase) synthesis and other processes needed for embryo development.
In phase III, a second rapid water uptake occurs.2,3 The
radicle emerges, which is the so-called visible germination3 and is further referred to as sprouting.4

Germination/sprouting itself is regulated
by plant hormones such
as abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellic acid (GA), ethylene, auxins, cytokinins,
and brassinosteroids.3,5 Their production and activity
are controlled by the level of expression of relevant genes. The plant
hormones most important for grain germination are ABA and GA. They
are synthesized in the embryo and diffuse to the aleurone. GA triggers
the aleurone cells to synthesize and secrete hydrolytic enzymes to
mobilize grain reserves that fuel the germination while ABA counteracts
these processes.1,6

As stated earlier, phase
II of the germination process is important
because of the major metabolic changes taking place therein. This
phase is impacted by seed priming, a pre-sowing treatment. Briefly,
grains are steeped in an osmotic solution to initiate metabolic activity
and subsequently dried to their initial moisture content prior to
sprouting/sowing.7 Common priming techniques
include hydro-priming and osmo-priming.

Hydro-priming is a term
covering grain imbibition with water for
a limited time period (7–14 h). It initiates the above phase
II metabolism without imposing a significant stress level on the grains.
In the process, emergence of the radicle (phase III) is avoided by
drying the grains to their original moisture content.8

Osmo-priming is a controlled treatment bringing ∼10
to 20%
of full hydration. It allows phase II physiological and biochemical
events to proceed by inducing abiotic stress conditions. In the process,
emergence of the radicle (phase III) is avoided by the applied negative
water potential.2,7,9,10

Osmo-priming is the most optimal at
higher water potentials (−0.3
to −1.5 MPa) and short priming times (12 h to 2 days).9,11−13 When applying more negative water potentials and/or
longer priming times, oxidative processes occur and so does a build-up
of components detrimental to sprouting.14 Most frequently used as a solute for osmo-priming is high-molecular-weight
polyethylene glycol (PEG). It induces high osmotic pressure and thereby
modifies the availability of water in the germination medium.15 Indeed, the hydration rate is decelerated by
the osmotic pressure. As a result, the level of cellular damage that
normally occurs as a consequence of rapid water entry into dry grains
is reduced.8 The use of PEG avoids toxicity
during priming because it is not taken up by grains due to its high
molecular weight.7 However, high PEG concentrations
result in high viscosity, which in turn limits oxygen transfer and
requires effective aeration during priming.16

Positive effects of priming on sprouting are ascribed to several
phenomena. First, the increased water content that it causes is important
for activating enzymes responsible for embryo development and mining
of the starchy endosperm.17 Second, priming
initiates biochemical mechanisms of cell repair, increases the RNA
content, and enhances DNA replication.7,10,12,17 Third, priming appears
to strengthen the defense system by increased activity of antioxidant
enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase.7,18

Upon sowing, primed grains more rapidly absorb water and revive
the grain metabolism than non-primed grains.15 As a result, seed priming increases the germination rate,19−21 uniformity of emergence,19,21 yield,21 and resistance of seedlings against unfavorable environmental
conditions.20

This study is aimed
to determine the impact of hydro-priming and
osmo-priming of wheat grains on the activities of selected hydrolytic
enzymes involved in the breakdown of starch, cell wall materials,
and phytates during subsequent sprouting. Amylases hydrolyze starch
for the mobilization of sugars to the growing embryo.6 Endoxylanases are key enzymes in the breakdown of arabinoxylan
(AX), the major component of wheat aleurone and starchy endosperm
cell walls.22 Phytase activity during germination
hydrolyzes phytate and therefore makes phosphate, mineral elements,
and myo-inositol available for plant growth and development.23 Both are of interest in the context of increasing
the bio-accessibility of mineral elements such as Fe and Zn, which
only amounts to 3–10%24 in mature
wheat due to their entrapment in cells with rigid walls and their
chelation by phytic acid.23,25

Overall, this
work provides a framework for optimizing agricultural
practice as well as the nutritional quality of wheat-based products.
Also, the findings of the present study can be of interest to reduce
process time in malt houses. Further, to the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to report on the impact of hydro-priming and osmo-priming
on energy mobilization and on plant hormone (GA, ABA, and auxin) production
in activated wheat grains. Not only the active forms of the hormones
but also some of their inactive conjugated storage forms were analyzed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Impact of Different Water Potentials of Priming
on the Germination Percentage of Wheat
In the small-scale
experiment, grains were allowed to sprout in PEG solutions of different
water potentials (0.0, −0.3, −0.6, −0.9, −1.2,
or −1.8 MPa) (see 3.2). After 72 h of
sprouting at 21 °C, the moisture content in grains was lower
when applying lower water potentials during priming (Table 1). They amounted to 56% when
priming was with deionized water (0.0 MPa, hydro-priming) and 45 and
33% when osmo-priming was with the −0.3 and −1.8 MPa
PEG solutions, respectively. Thus, an applied water potential of −0.3
MPa already strongly impacted the water uptake rate. This may be due
to the smaller differences in water potential between medium and grain
when using PEG solutions than when using deionized water, which made
water uptake more difficult in the former.

The lower moisture content of the osmo-primed grains
led to slower
germination/sprouting. After 72 h at 21 °C, the germination percentage
was 96% in hydro-primed grains and 92 and 80% in grains primed at
−0.3 and −0.6 MPa, respectively (Table 1). In addition, hydro-priming and osmo-priming
at −0.3 and −0.6 MPa were suitable pretreatments as
the grains were in phase II of the germination process for a relative
long time period. Indeed, radicle emergence was only observed after
24 h (data not shown). Applying even lower water potentials (−0.9,
−1.2, and −1.8 MPa) led to germination percentages of
maximally 28%. The grains were imposed to high osmotic stress during
the entire time of sprouting (72 h). Earlier, Abbasdokht26 noted germination percentages of only 36 and
27% for wheat grains osmo-primed with PEG solutions of −0.8
and −1.2 MPa, respectively, and sprouted for at least 5 days
at 25 °C. Further, Almansouri et al.27 observed no seedling growth (i.e., a germination percentage of 0%)
in wheat grains osmo-primed in PEG solution of −1.6 MPa after
6 days at 24 °C. The reduced germination/sprouting ability as
a result of increased PEG concentrations during priming may result
from inhibition of the grain metabolism as a result of the high abiotic
stress.28

Based on these results,
for further experiments, we selected hydro-priming
and osmo-priming at −0.3 and −0.6 MPa as valuable water
potentials and at −1.2 MPa as a too extreme (toxic) treatment,
the latter for comparison reasons. Similar germination percentages
and radicle and coleoptile lengths were observed at priming times
of 8, 12, or 16 h (data not shown).

2.2 Impact of Hydro-Priming and Osmo-Priming on
Seedling Characteristics of Sprouted Wheat
We observed no
significantly different increases in moisture content during steeping
and sprouting in the pilot-scale micro malting system at 15 °C
between control (i.e., regular, untreated wheat) and hydro-primed
and osmo-primed wheat grains (data not shown). This was rather surprising
as osmo-priming was expected to increase the uptake of water during
steeping due to the lower water potential in these grains than in
control wheat. Indeed, grains release organic solutes such as free
amino acids (for example, proline and glycine) and betaine in response
to the low external water potential during osmo-priming.29

2.2.1 Germination Percentage
The impact
of different priming treatments on the germination rate and capacity
of wheat grains was determined by monitoring the percentage of germinated
grains at specific times during the steeping phase of 29 h and after
24 h of sprouting (Figure 1). The first visible sign of sprouting was observed after
15 h of steeping. Between 15 and 29 h of steeping, the hydro-primed
and osmo-primed wheat grains had higher germination percentages than
the control except when priming was at −1.2 MPa. The wheat
grains primed at −0.3 and −0.6 MPa had the highest germination
percentages after 15 and 20 h of steeping, which clearly shows the
beneficial effect of osmo-priming already early in the process. The
increased germination after osmo-priming at −0.3 and −0.6
MPa can be ascribed to an increased rate of cell division in the grain11 and the completion of pre-germinative metabolic
activities and repair processes. All the above treatments make the
primed grains sooner ready for radicle protrusion than control grains.9 Later during the process (20–29 h of steeping),
clearly higher germination percentages were noted for the hydro-primed
grains and grains primed at −0.3 MPa than for control grains.
In contrast, similar germination percentages were noted for both control
grains and grains primed at −0.6 and −1.2 MPa.

Figure 1 Germination
percentages (%) as a function of steeping and sprouting
time (h) of non-primed (control), hydro-primed (0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed
(−0.3, −0.6 and −1.2 MPa) wheat grains (see pilot-scale
experiment).

After 24 h of sprouting at 15 °C, at least
90% of all primed
and control wheat samples had germinated. Earlier, Almansouri et al.27 stated that PEG-treated wheat embryos remain
quiescent and that almost all of them can sprout when the stress imposed
by osmo-priming is relieved. The obtained results here are different
from the results in the small-scale experiment (see 2.1) where the osmotic stress was not relieved during sprouting
of wheat.

2.2.2 Radicle and Coleoptile Length
The
lengths of both radicles and coleoptiles were measured after 24, 72,
and 120 h of sprouting (Figure 2). When comparing the impact of different priming treatments
at a same sprouting time (24 h), it was observed that mild priming
(0.0, −0.3, and −0.6 MPa) resulted in increased radicle
growth (Figure 2A).
While no coleoptiles were visible yet (Figure 2B), radicles were approximately 3 times longer
in hydro-primed (0.0 MPa) grains and 1.8 to 2.5 times longer in grains
primed at −0.3 and −0.6 MPa than in control wheat. This
result is in line with that of Yari et al.13 who found maximum radicle and coleoptile lengths in wheat grains
primed with PEG solutions of approximately −0.15 or approximately
−0.54 MPa for 12 h at 20 °C and subsequently sprouted
for 8 days at 25 °C. The radicle and coleoptiles in their primed
grains were 6–10% longer than those in control grains.13 Increased coleoptile and radicle lengths as
a result of priming may be due to increased nuclear replication in
these tissues.12 In addition, Zhang et
al.18 showed that improved cell membrane
stability and reduced lipid peroxidation in seedlings of sorghum grains
osmo-primed with PEG solution of approximately −0.56 MPa are
accompanied by increased activities of antioxidant enzymes such as
superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione reductase. This suggests
that grain priming improves plant growth by reducing the impact of
oxidative reactions caused by reactive oxygen species in plant cells.18 Finally, it is hypothesized that the seedlings
of primed wheat may contain higher potassium, zinc, and/or calcium
contents than those of control wheat as these mineral elements are
involved in cell growth,30 cell elongation,31 and/or cell division31 and as Lemmens et al.32 found them to
be present in elongating coleoptile and/or radicle tips of wheat.

lengths (mm) and (B) coleoptile lengths (mm) as a function
of sprouting time (h) of non-primed (control), hydro-primed (0.0 MPa),
and osmo-primed (−0.3, −0.6, and −1.2 MPa) wheat
grains (see pilot-scale experiment). Mean values for the same treatment
differ significantly (P < 0.05) with those not
sharing the same upper case letter. Mean values for the same sprouting
time differ significantly (P < 0.05) with those
not sharing the same lower case letter.

After 72 and 120 h of sprouting, only the hydro-primed
grains had
significantly longer radicles and coleoptiles (doubled lengths) than
control grains. Abbasdokht26 found the
radicles and coleoptiles of wheat grains subjected to hydro-priming
to be 1.2- to 1.3-fold longer than those of their non-primed counterparts.
Furthermore, others noted that hydro-priming is more effective at
improving the germination rate and increasing radicle and coleoptile
lengths in wheat than priming treatments with PEG,13,21 potassium phosphate,13,21 calcium chloride,10 and potassium chloride.10,13,21

As a note, significant differences
were observed neither in radicle
nor in coleoptile lengths between 72 and 120 h of sprouting within
the same priming treatment. This may be because no additional submersion
in water was performed during sprouting.

2.3 Impact of Hydro-Priming and Osmo-Priming on
Plant Hormone Concentrations in (Sprouted) Wheat
To evaluate
the impact of different priming treatments on the presence of plant
hormones in wheat grains during subsequent steeping and sprouting,
concentrations of ABA, active GAs, inactive GAs, IAA (conjugates),
IAA-OX (conjugates), IAA-OH (conjugates), IBA-OX (conjugates), and
IBA-OH (conjugates) were determined. As a note, the oxidized forms
of IAA were hardly present in all wheat samples (data not shown).

The ABA concentration after priming and during the first 24 h of
sprouting was low in all samples (<41 pmol/g dm) (Figure 3A). This was probably due to
the presence of ABA as a biologically inactive metabolite.33 Only low levels of ABA allow for seedling development
since ABA adversely affects grain germination.5 ABA concentrations in all samples but the one primed at −1.2
MPa were increased after 120 h of sprouting with levels ranging between
75 and 250 pmol/g dm, which inter alia protected the growing seedling
from dehydration. A major role of ABA during vegetative growth is
to optimize growth under adverse conditions by maintaining osmotic
homeostasis.34 Yamada35 found that endogenous ABA levels decrease during steeping
of barley, while especially in the later stage of sprouting (4–6
days of sprouting), they increase.

gibberellic acid (GA) forms, (C) indole acetic acid (IAA), and (D)
IAA conjugates] concentrations [pmol/g dry matter (dm)] for different
sample types [control wheat, hydro-primed wheat (0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed
wheat (−0.3, −0.6, and −1.2 MPa)] after priming,
steeping (0 h of sprouting), and 24 and 120 h of sprouting at 15 °C
(see pilot-scale experiment). Values of replicates are represented
as three small columns within an unfilled column giving the mean value
of these three replicates. Mean values for the same process time differ
significantly (P < 0.05) with those not sharing
the same upper case letter. Mean values for the same sample type differ
significantly (P < 0.05) with those not sharing
the same lower case letter.

ABA is positively related to activities of plants
under stress.5 At the cellular level, it
can indeed promote
the tolerance to some abiotic stresses such as those imposed by low
temperature, salinity, and drought.34 That
ABA levels in grains primed at −1.2 MPa remained low during
sprouting might be related to induction of too high osmotic stresses
in these grains.

GA is needed for grain germination. It inhibits
ABA activity and
activates catabolizing enzymes such as amylases and peptidases.5,34 Moreover, it may benefit the growth of the embryo and overcome the
mechanical restraint for radicle protrusion by weakening the tissues
surrounding it.36 Given the above, one
would expect that, in line with it having long radicles and coleoptiles
(see 2.2.2) and increased α-amylase activity
levels (see 2.4), hydro-primed wheat has clearly
higher levels of active (Figure 3B) and/or inactive GA than control wheat (Figure 4A). However, this
could not be concluded from the present data since no significant
differences in GA concentrations were found between the different
samples under study. Plant hormone concentrations are subject to biological
variation and strongly depend on the exact moment of sampling since
their upregulation and downregulation are dynamic processes, certainly
when considering eight different GA types at low concentrations.

and (B) sum of indole butyric acid (IBA)-OH and IBA-OX] concentrations

hydro-primed (0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed (−0.3, −0.6,
and −1.2 MPa)] wheat after priming, steeping (0 h of sprouting),
and 24 and 120 h of sprouting at 15 °C (see pilot-scale experiment).
Values of replicates are represented as small columns within an unfilled
column giving the mean value of these replicates. Mean values for
the same process time differ significantly (P <
0.05) with those not sharing the same upper case letter. Mean values
for the same sample type differ significantly (P <
0.05) with those not sharing the same lower case letter.

In all wheat samples, GA7 was the active form present
at the highest
concentrations (10–650 pmol/g dm) followed by GA4 (2–150
pmol/g dm). GA12, GA15, GA9, and GA44 were the dominant inactive GA
forms present in all wheat samples. GA12 (levels ranging between 160
and 6400 pmol/g dm) and GA15 (levels ranging between 74 and 5700 pmol/g
dm) were dominantly present in control and primed (sprouted) wheat
grains, while GA9 was present at intermediate concentrations (30–1300
pmol/g dm) and GA44 was present at rather low (25–600 pmol/g
dm) concentrations. The active form GA1 and the inactive form GA19
were detected at levels very near the limit of quantification (41
± 19 and 33 ± 16 pmol/g dm, respectively) in 47 and 35%
of all samples measured, respectively.

These observations match
well with the known biosynthesis pathways
of wheat GAs in which different forms are derived from geranylgeranyl
diphosphate as a substrate through a series of oxidation and hydroxylation
reactions.37−39 From GA12 aldehyde, GA15 and GA9 arise by GA20-oxidase
action. The active forms GA7 and GA4 arise from GA9 by GA3-oxidase
action. GA44, GA19, and GA1 can only be formed by a step in which
GA13-oxidase is active39 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). Our results are thus the
first to lead to the suggestion that GA20-oxidase during wheat germination/sprouting
is more active than GA3-oxidase and much more active than GA13-oxidase.

Auxins like IAA and IBA play a key role in regulating cell cycling,
growth, elongation, and development and are, for example, present
in the grain radicle tip during and after grain sprouting.5 Priming of grains prior to sprouting did not
impact their IAA concentrations. Indeed, for a given process time,
no significant differences were found between the different sample
types (Figure 3C).
While osmo-priming led to significantly higher IAA concentrations
after priming, it did not result in higher levels during subsequent
sprouting. The latter may indicate the biosynthesis of radicle and/or
coleoptile apical meristematic tissues during osmo-priming.

Priming of grains prior to sprouting also did not impact the concentrations
of their IAA conjugates (Figure 3D). Only after 120 h of sprouting were significantly
higher IAA conjugate concentrations found in all sample types except
grains primed at −1.2 MPa.

Further, the IAA concentrations
generally decreased while the IAA
conjugate concentrations increased during sprouting. The imbalance
between active IAA and inactive IAA conjugates is a result of intensive
regulation of the hormone steady state during seedling development,
and we postulate that, when the germination process is activated and
the seedling is growing (i.e., sprouting), IAA is less needed, leading
to its conversion into its conjugates. The sum of IBA-OH and IBA-OX
(IBA-OX/-OH) concentrations (Figure 4B) was ∼10-fold higher than the IAA concentrations.
Moreover, the IBA-OX/-OH and the IAA conjugate concentrations followed
a similar trend in primed, steeped, or sprouted wheat grains. IBA
can be oxidized to IBA-OX/-OH and the latter into IAA.40 IBA has been considered to be an endogenous
auxin in a variety of plant species. It may be more important than
IAA in radicle initiation and development since it is for example
more stable under various light and temperature conditions and less
susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis. It may function in vivo through
its conversion to IAA or act as an independent auxin.41

Finally we note that, overall, the plant hormone
concentrations
in grains primed at −1.2 MPa and subsequently sprouted were
lower than in all other samples under study. The high osmotic stress
to which these grains were subjected may have impacted their hormone
balance and/or transport.

2.4 Impact of Hydro-Priming and Osmo-Priming on
α-Amylase Activity Levels and Reducing Sugar Contents in (Sprouted)
Wheat
The α-amylase activity in non-sprouted control
wheat was low. It amounted to only 4.5 U/h/g dm. A huge increase was
observed in control and primed grains as a result of 120 h of sprouting
(Figure 5A). Germination/sprouting
initiates de novo synthesis of α-amylase.42 After steeping (i.e., 0 h of sprouting), its activity in
primed wheat was significantly higher than that in control wheat.
This was expected as priming activates the metabolism, leading to
faster induction of germination/sprouting processes such as the mobilization
of starch to supply energy for the embryo.7 During subsequent sprouting, mainly hydro-primed grains showed clearly
2- to 3-fold higher enzyme activity levels, which goes well with the
observation of significantly longer radicles and coleoptiles (see 2.2.2). Earlier, Jafar et al.43 noted an only 30% higher increase in α-amylase activity
in hydro-primed wheat. No significant difference in enzyme activity
was observed after 72 versus 120 h of sprouting for grains primed
at −1.2 MPa. The high PEG concentration induced osmotic stress
in these grains and led to disruption of the sprouting processes which
was also clear from their low plant hormone concentrations (see 2.3).

Figure 5 (A) α-Amylase activity levels [U/h/g dry matter
(dm)] and
(B) reducing sugar contents [mg maltose equivalents (eq)/g dm] as
a function of sprouting time (h) of non-primed (control), hydro-primed
(0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed (−0.3, −0.6 and −1.2
MPa) wheat grains (see pilot-scale experiment). Mean values for the
same treatment differ significantly (P < 0.05)
with those not sharing the same upper case letter. Mean values for
the same sprouting time differ significantly (P <
0.05) with those not sharing the same lower case letter.

The reducing sugar content in non-sprouted control
wheat amounted
to 1.5 mg maltose eq/g dm. Sprouting wheat for 120 h led to a 4- to
20-fold increase in the reducing sugar content depending on the priming
treatment and in line with the α-amylase activity levels (Figure 5B). α-Amylase
action leads to (partial) hydrolysis of starch into maltose, maltotriose,
and a wide range of dextrins and thus increases the reducing sugar
content.42 In this context, it is worth
mentioning that Farooq et al.44 revealed
a direct relationship between increased α-amylase activity levels
and total soluble sugar contents in hydro-primed rice grains.

In the present case, the largest increase in enzymatic activity
and formation of reducing sugars was observed between 24 and 72 h
of sprouting (Figure 5). The reducing sugar contents in (primed) sprouted wheat grains
strongly depended on the pretreatment. Hydro-priming and osmo-priming
at −0.3 MPa led to significantly higher reducing sugar contents
during sprouting, especially after 72 and 120 h. This can lower the
need for sugar addition in wheat-derived products and is also of interest
in the context of brewing in which high concentrations of fermentable
sugars are needed.

The concentrations in the sprouted primed
grains amounted to 25–32
mg maltose eq/g dm after hydro-priming and to 22–28 mg maltose
eq/g dm after osmo-priming (−0.3 MPa), while values of only
14–18 mg maltose eq/g dm were found in control wheat. There
was no clear difference between the reducing sugar content as a result
of sprouting between control grains and that of grains primed at −0.6
MPa. However, priming at −1.2 MPa clearly inhibited α-amylase
activity, which was reflected in low reducing sugar contents, which
only amounted to 6.2 mg maltose eq/g dm in 120 h sprouted wheat grains.

2.5 Impact of Hydro-Priming and Osmo-Priming on
Endoxylanase Activity Levels and Water-Extractable Arabinoxylan Contents
in (Sprouted) Wheat
The endoxylanase activity level in non-sprouted
control wheat was 0.13 U/h/g dm. Significant differences were only
observed after 72 h of sprouting. De Backer et al.22 also observed low endogenous endoxylanase activities in
wheat in the early stage of sprouting (up to 72 h). In the present
case, after 72 h of sprouting, hydro-primed grains had much higher
activity levels (2.1 U/h/g dm) than osmo-primed (1.1 U/h/g dm for
−0.3 MPa and 0.6 U/h/g dm for −0.6 MPa) and control
grains (0.3 U/h/g dm) (Figure 6A). After 120 h of sprouting, the observations were similar
although the enzyme activity of the osmo-primed grains (−0.3
and −0.6 MPa) no longer significantly differed from that of
the control. The synthesis of endoxylanase can thus be accelerated
by priming but does not necessarily lead to an increase in the total
activity after 120 h of sprouting. The activity levels in grains primed
at −1.2 MPa remained low with a maximum value of only 0.27
U/h/g dm after 120 h of sprouting. Under such conditions, α-amylase
activity levels were also low (see 2.4). This
confirms once more that a too low water potential during priming is
detrimental to grain sprouting.

Figure 6 (A) Endoxylanase activity levels (U/h/g
dm) and (B) water-extractable
arabinoxylan (WEAX) contents (% of dm) as a function of sprouting
time (h) of non-primed (control), hydro-primed (0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed
(−0.3, −0.6, and −1.2 MPa) wheat grains (see
pilot-scale experiment). Mean values for the same treatment differ
significantly (P < 0.05) with those not sharing
the same upper case letter. Mean values for the same sprouting time
differ significantly (P < 0.05) with those not
sharing the same lower case letter.

The increase in endoxylanase activity during sprouting
corresponded
with an increase in WEAX content from 0.48% of dm in non-sprouted
control wheat to 0.98–1.34% of dm in (primed) wheat grains
sprouted for 120 h (Figure 6). Indeed, endoxylanase converts water-unextractable AX into
WEAX, thereby causing structural changes in cereal cell walls,22,45 which may be an indication of cell wall opening and hence nutrient
release. Furthermore, soluble dietary fibers in particular (for example,
WEAX) are one of the primary substrates for microbial fermentation
in the human colon.46 Short-chain fatty
acids as fermentation products can then promote colonic health by
providing energy for the colonocytes and by decreasing gut permeability
and motility.47 Finally, the degradation
of AX is also of interest for maltsters and brewers since the incomplete
degradation of dietary fiber components may result in high wort viscosity,
causing filtration problems and, hence, reducing the extract yield
after mashing.48

The WEAX contents
for all treatments under study significantly
increased with sprouting time. Prior hydro-priming and osmo-priming
led to significantly higher WEAX contents after steeping, confirming
the grain’s activated metabolism. The highest WEAX contents
(1.32–1.34% of dm) were obtained in hydro-primed or osmo-primed
(−0.3 MPa) grains sprouted for 120 h. The control grains and
grains osmo-primed at −1.2 MPa contained lower WEAX contents
(0.98–1.08% of dm) after 72 and 120 h of sprouting than did
the other sprouted primed grains.

2.6 Impact of Hydro-Priming and Osmo-Priming on
Phytase Activity Levels and Phytate Contents in (Sprouted) Wheat
The endogenous phytase activity level in non-sprouted control wheat
corresponded to a release of 1.6 μmol phosphate/min/g dm. A
significant increase in activity was found as a function of sprouting
time. After 120 h of sprouting, it reached values of 8.1–9.3
μmol phosphate/min/g dm, depending on the priming treatment
(Figure 7A). After
steeping and after 24 h of sprouting, only hydro-primed grains showed
16 to 27% higher phytase activity levels than the other (primed) samples.
Wheat itself contains a limited level of preformed inactive phytases,49 which may have been activated already during
hydro-priming. Maybe impacting phase II of the germination process
by priming does not impact phytase activity that much since the enzyme
is first activated before it is de novo synthesized.

Figure 7 (A) Phytase activity
levels (μmol/min/g dm) and (B) phytate
contents (% of dm) as a function of sprouting time (h) of non-primed
(control), hydro-primed (0.0 MPa), and osmo-primed (−0.3, −0.6
and −1.2 MPa) wheat grains (see pilot-scale experiment). Mean
values for the same treatment differ significantly (P < 0.05) with those not sharing the same upper case letter. Mean
values for the same sprouting time differ significantly (P < 0.05) with those not sharing the same lower case letter.

In this context, it is worth mentioning that Nasri
et al.50 showed significant improvements
in phytase activities
in radicles, coleoptiles, and cotyledons of lettuce grains primed
in 0.05% potassium nitrate at 25 °C for 2 h. Increased phosphatase
activities may boost cell metabolism due to accelerated phosphate
release and transport to support biosynthetic reactions in the growing
embryo.50

Grains primed at −1.2
MPa showed 7–13% lower phytase
activity levels than the other primed samples and control wheat after
120 h of sprouting, indicating a too high PEG concentration in the
priming solution for optimal metabolic activity in the grains.

The 5- to 6-fold increase in phytase activity during sprouting
corresponded with a decrease in phytate content from 0.96% of dm in
non-sprouted control wheat to 0.94–0.78% of dm in (primed)
wheat grains sprouted for 120 h (Figure 7B). Phytate concentrations in the control
were significantly decreased after 72 h of sprouting, while they were
only significantly decreased after 120 h of sprouting in hydro-primed
and osmo-primed (−0.3 MPa) grains. The highest phytate breakdown
(19%) was obtained in grains hydro-primed and subsequently sprouted
for 120 h. Osmo-priming at −0.6 or −1.2 MPa did not
decrease phytate contents although the phytase levels were substantially
increased. It may be that phytase action is limited in these grains
due to the induced osmotic stress.

It seems that conditions
more optimal for endogenous wheat phytase
action (pH 4.0; 50 °C) are needed to hydrolyze phytate to a larger
extent than noted here, and thus, to increase mineral bio-accessibility
considerably more.24

In conclusion,
this study shows that hydro-priming and, to a lesser
extent, mild osmo-priming at a water potential of −0.3 MPa
are powerful pretreatments of wheat grains prior to sprouting. Indeed,
they can improve the nutritional properties (e.g., levels of bio-accessible
nutrients, soluble dietary fiber, and intrinsic saccharides) of wheat
whole grain food products. Moreover, this study offers opportunities
for optimizing agricultural practice as well as industrial processes
such as malting.

3 Materials and Methods
3.1 Materials
All chemicals and reagents
were of analytical grade and purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Bornem,
Belgium), unless otherwise specified. Wheat (Cellule winter wheat)
was kindly supplied by Limagrain (Avelgem, Belgium).

3.2 Hydro-Priming or Osmo-Priming and Subsequent
Sprouting of Wheat Grains on a Small-Scale
First, at least
three samples of 25 grains were each put on a filter paper (90 mm
diameter, Whatman filter, GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Buckinghamshire,
UK) wetted with deionized water (hydro-priming; 0.0 MPa) or with polyethylene
glycol (PEG 8000) solutions (osmo-priming) with water potentials of
−0.3, −0.6, −0.9, −1.2, or −1.8
MPa. The concentration of PEG needed to obtain the desired water potential
was calculated using the formula presented by Michel:51  with φ representing the water potential
(bar) and T the temperature (°C).

Next,
these grains were incubated in a climate chamber with a day/night
cycle of 12 h at 21 °C, a light intensity of 120 μmol/m2s (white light from fluorescence lamps), and 70% relative
humidity while monitoring their moisture content (see 3.4) and the germination percentage (see 3.4) over a 72 h time period.

3.3 Hydro-Priming or Osmo-Priming and Subsequent
Steeping and Sprouting of Wheat Grains on a Pilot Scale
Based
on the outcome of the above, grains (40.0 g) were hydro-primed at
least in triplicate in deionized water (0.0 MPa) or osmo-primed in
PEG solutions (300 mL) with water potentials of −0.3, −0.6,
or −1.2 MPa for 12 h at room temperature (RT) under gentle
magnetic stirring. After osmo-priming, the grains were washed three
times for 5 min with deionized water to remove residual PEG from their
surface. Afterward, they were oven-dried for 4 h at 40 °C and
subsequently air-dried to reach a moisture content of 10–13%
(i.e., about their initial moisture content).

Next, regular
(control) and primed wheat grains were steeped and sprouted in a pilot-scale
micromalting system (Joe White Malting Systems, Perth, Australia).
The steeping process consisted of successive wet stages (7, 7, and
3 h at 15 °C) in a clear excess of deionized water and alternated
by air rest stages (6 and 6 h at 15 °C). In a next step, the
imbibed grains were sprouted for 120 h at 15 °C. Samples were
withdrawn after steeping and after 24, 72, and 120 h of sprouting.
They were then flash-frozen with liquid N2 and used for
determining the seedling characteristics (see 3.4) and plant hormone concentrations (see 3.5). For all other further analyses, the flash-frozen samples were
freeze-dried.

3.4 Seedling Characteristics
The moisture
content in grains was determined according to the AACC method 44-15.052 in which the grains (2.0 g) are dried for 16
h at 130 °C.

For determining the percentage (%) of germinated
grains, a grain was considered to be germinated when its radicle had
penetrated the surrounding structures and the white tip had become
visible. For the small and pilot-scale experiment, 25 and 30 grains
were used, respectively.

The growth of the seedlings was analyzed
in sprouted (primed) wheat
grains by measuring the lengths (in mm) of the radicles and coleoptiles
of 10 different grains with a digital calliper.

3.5 Plant Hormone Concentrations
3.5.1 Auxins and Abscisic Acid
Wheat
samples [100 mg taken from 10 flash-frozen, pooled, and magnalised
grains (Retsch Mill MM200, Verder, Aartselaar, Belgium)] were extracted
in triplicate in 800 μL of 80% methanol. [C13]-IAA
[(phenyl-13C6)-indole-3-acetic acid, 99%, Cambridge
Isotopes, Tewksbury, MA, USA] and d-ABA ([2H6](+)-cis, trans-abscisic
acid, [(S)-5-[2H6](1-hydroxy-2,6,6-trimethyl-4-oxocyclohex-2-en-1-yl)-3-methyl-(2Z,4E)-pentadienoic acid], Olchemim, Olomouc,
Czech Republic) were added as internal tracers (200 pmol of each).

After overnight extraction and subsequent centrifugation (20 min,
15,000g, 4 °C, Eppendorf 5810R, Eppendorf, Hamburg,
Germany), the supernatants were aliquoted in two equal parts.

One aliquot was acidified using 5.0 mL of 6.0% formic acid and
concentrated on a reversed-phase (RP)-C18 cartridge (500 mg, BondElut
Varian, Middelburg, The Netherlands). The compounds of interest [IAA,
ABA, and the oxidation products IAA-OX, IAA-OH, indole-butyric acid
(IBA)-OX, and IBA-OH] were eluted with 5.0 mL of diethyl ether and
dried under nitrogen (TurboVap LV Evaporator, Zymark, New Boston,
MA, USA).

The second aliquot was kept in 7.0 M NaOH for 3 h
at 100 °C
under a water-saturated nitrogen atmosphere to hydrolyze all ether
and ester conjugates.53 Afterward, the
samples were acidified using 2.0 M HCl, concentrated on an RP-C18
cartridge (500 mg), and eluted with diethyl ether as described before.

All samples were methylated using ethereal diazomethane54 to improve analysis sensitivity. Thus, all acid
compounds were analyzed as their corresponding methyl esters. Samples
were analyzed using an Acquity UPLC system linked to a TQD triple
quadrupole detector (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an electrospray
interface in positive mode. Samples (6.0 μL) were injected on
an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 RP column (1.7 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm,
Waters) using a column temperature of 30 °C and eluted at 0.3
mL/min with the following gradient of 0.01 M ammonium acetate (solvent
A) and methanol (solvent B): 0–2 min isocratic 90% A, 10% B;
2–4 min linear gradient to 10% A, 90% B. Quantification was
done by multiple reactant monitoring of selected transitions based
on the MH+ ion (dwell time 0.02 s) and the most appropriate
compound-specific product ions in combination with the compound-specific
cone and collision settings. All data were processed using Masslynx/Quanlynx
software V4.1 (Waters).

3.5.2 Gibberellic Acid
Wheat samples
(100 mg taken from 10 flash-frozen, pooled, and magnalised grains)
were extracted in triplicate overnight in 1.0 mL of acidified methanol
pH 4.0 [80/20, methanol/5.0 mM formic acid-containing butylated hydroxytoluene
(3–5 crystals)]. As internal tracers, d2-GA1, d2-GA4, d2-GA8,
d2-GA9, d2-GA15, d2-GA19, d2-GA20, and d2-GA29 (20 pmol each, Olchemim)
were added. After purification on an RP-C18 cartridge (500 mg), samples
were derivatized with N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide (1.0 mg/sample, pH 4.0, 60 min,
37 °C under continuous shaking, Eppendorf thermomixer). Next,
these derivatized samples were analyzed using a UPLC-MS/MS equipped
with an electrospray interface in positive mode (ACQUITY, TQD, Waters).
Samples (6.0 μL) were injected on an ACQUITY BEH C18 column
(2.1 × 50 mm; 1.7 mm, Waters) using a column temperature of 30
°C and eluted at 450 μL/min with the following gradient
of 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile
(solvent B): 0–0.8 min isocratic 92% A, 8% B; 0.8–5
min linear gradient to 60%A, 40%B; 5–5.5 min linear gradient
to 10% A, 90% B.

3.6 α-Amylase Activity and Reducing Sugar
Content
α-Amylase activity was determined in triplicate
with the amylazyme method (Megazyme, Bray, Ireland) as described in
De Brier et al.55 but with slight modifications.
A substrate tablet was added to 1.0 mL of a 5–50 times diluted
pre-incubated extract from a whole meal of freeze-dried samples at
40 °C, and the reaction was stopped after 5 to 120 min of incubation.
Extract dilution and incubation time depended on the prior sprouting
time. One α-amylase unit (U) is defined as the enzyme activity
per gram of dm, which increases the extinction at 590 nm by 1.00 per
60 min of incubation at 40 °C.

The reducing sugar content
in a whole meal of freeze-dried samples was determined at least in
triplicate as described by Moretti and Thorson56 but also with slight modifications. Prior to analysis,
α-amylase in the whole meal was inactivated by suspending an
aliquot (0.20–0.50 g, depending on the time of sprouting) in
80% ethanol (10.0 mL) and evaporating the added ethanol at 95 °C.
The resulting whole meal was then suspended in 2.0 mL of deionized
water, and the mixture was
stirred for 20 min at 150 rotations per minute (rpm) and 7 °C.
It was then centrifuged (10 min, 4000g, 20 °C).
An aliquot of the supernatant (15 μL) was mixed with 1.50 mL
of p-hydroxybenzoic acid hydrazide (pOH-BH) solution
(i.e., 9:1 mixture of 0.50 M sodium hydroxide and 5.0% w/v pOH-BH
in 0.50 M hydrochloric acid) and heated for 5 min at 100 °C.
After 10 min of cooling at RT, the extinction was measured at 410
nm and the concentration of reducing sugars in the extracts was determined
using a calibration curve made with 0.0–5.0 mg maltose/mL.
The reducing sugar content is expressed as milligrams of maltose equivalents
(eq) per gram of dm.

3.7 Endoxylanase Activity and Water-Extractable
Arabinoxylan Content
Endoxylanase activity was determined
at least in triplicate with the Xylazyme AX method (Megazyme) as described
in De Brier et al55 with slight modifications.
The enzymatic reaction was stopped after 6 h of incubation at 40 °C.
One endoxylanase U is defined as the enzyme activity per gram of dm,
which increases the extinction at 590 nm by 1.00 per 60 min of incubation
at 40 °C.

Prior to determining the water-extractable arabinoxylan
(WEAX) content at least in triplicate, endoxylanase was inactivated
by suspending an aliquot (0.334 g) in 80% ethanol (10.0 mL) and evaporating
the added ethanol at 95 °C. The resulting whole meal was then
suspended in 20.0 mL of deionized water, extracted (30 min, 150 rpm,
7 °C), and centrifuged (10 min, 1500g, 7 °C)
at least in triplicate. The WEAX in the supernatant was quantified
by gas chromatography (Agilent 6890 Series, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
as described by Loosveld et al.57 In essence,
carbohydrates were converted to monosaccharides by acid hydrolysis
with trifluoroacetic acid. Next, alditols were formed by reduction
with sodium borohydride under alkaline conditions. Finally, the resulting
alditols were derivatized to form alditol acetates using 1-methylimidazole
as the catalyst. WEAX content was calculated as 0.88 × the sum
of xylose and arabinose contents.

3.8 Phytase Activity and Phytate Content
Phytase activity in an aliquot of a whole meal extract (pH 5.0) was
determined at least in triplicate based on the method of Heinonen
and Lahti58 described in the study of Lemmens
et al.24 Briefly, inorganic orthophosphate
released from phytic acid is quantified colorimetrically (400 nm)
using ammonium molybdate. One phytase U is defined as the amount of
enzyme that releases one micromole of phosphate per minute of incubation
per gram of dm at 37 °C under the conditions of the assay.

The phytate content in the whole meal was determined at least in
triplicate after acid extraction of myo-inositol phosphates following
the procedure of the K-Phyt assay kit (Megazyme) as described by Lemmens
et al.24 The concentration of free phosphates
in the extracts was subtracted from the phosphate concentration after
subsequent breakdown of myo-inositol phosphates by phytase and alkaline
phosphatase. The phytate content was calculated by dividing that of
bound phosphorus by 0.282.

3.9 Statistical Analyses
Statistical
analyses were conducted using the Statistical Analysis System software
14.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). One-way ANOVA with Tukey multiple
comparison testing was used to verify whether mean values of responses
under study were significantly (P < 0.05) different.
