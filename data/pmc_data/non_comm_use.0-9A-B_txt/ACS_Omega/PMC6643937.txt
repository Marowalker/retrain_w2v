Redox flow batteries
(RFBs) have recently been recognized as a
potentially viable technology for scalable energy storage. To take
full advantage of RFBs, one possible approach for achieving high energy
densities is to maximize a number of redox events by utilizing charge
carriers capable of multiple one-electron transfers within the electrochemical
window of solvent. However, past efforts to develop more efficient
electrolytes for nonaqueous RFBs have mostly been empirical. In this
manuscript, we shed light on design principles by theoretically investigating
the effects of systematically substituting pyridyl moieties with imine
ligands within a series of Fe complexes with some experimental validation.
We found that such replacement is an effective strategy for reducing
the molecular weight-to-charge ratios of these complexes. Simultaneously,
calculations suggest that the reduction potentials and ligand-based
redox activity of such substituted N-heterocyclic Fe compounds might
be maintained within their +4 → −1 charge states. Additionally,
by theoretically examining the role of coordination geometry, vis-à-vis
reducing the number of redox noninnocent ligands within the first
coordination sphere, we have demonstrated that Fe complexes with one
such ligand were also capable of supporting multielectron reduction
events and exhibited reduction potentials similar to their parent
analogs supported by two or three of the same multidentate ligands.
However, some differences in redox nature within the lower (+2 →
−1) charge states were also noticed. Specifically, complexes
containing two bidentate ligands, or one tridentate ligand, exhibited
ligand-based reductions, whereas compounds with one bidentate ligand
exhibited metal-centered reductions. The current results pave the
way toward the design of the next-generation of Fe complexes with
lower molecular weights and greater stored energy for redox flow batteries.

1 Introduction
Due
to the implementation of a rational design scheme, in which
power density is decoupled from energy density, redox flow batteries
(RFBs) have recently been recognized as a potentially viable technology
for scalable energy storage and hence may facilitate better utilization
of renewable energy into grid-scale systems.1−3 All-vanadium
RFBs, which are based on one-electron redox couples (VII/VIII and VIV/VV couples), represent
the most advanced non-hybrid RFBs that are being commercialized.4−5 Due to the high price
of vanadium and the temperature limited, low solubility of electroactive
species, replacement of vanadium by cheaper metals represents one
of the logical options with respect to more economically competitive
RFBs. Another avenue that can potentially reduce the cost of the RFB
and improve the efficiency of commercial RFBs is via the utilization
of multielectron charge carriers, capable of operating within multiple
charge states and storing/releasing multiple electrons. For instance,
zinc–bromine hybrid RFBs are attractive for commercialization7,8 since they offer one of the highest cell voltages, due to the release
of two electrons per atom of zinc, thus exhibiting high energy densities.
However, due to their hybrid configuration, in which all of the energy
of one half-reaction is stored in the zinc anode, power and energy
storage are not completely decoupled, hence, one of the electrodes
cannot be scaled easily by adding/increasing tank size. Therefore,
to take full advantage of RFBs, one viable approach for achieving
high energy densities is to use charge carriers capable of multiple
one-electron transfers within the electrochemical window (EW) of the
chosen solvent. In this work, we use MeCN as a solvent of choice due
to its low viscosity, relatively low price, and wide EW (5.75
V), which is greater than that of water (1.23 V), thus providing us
with an opportunity to access more charge states.

It has previously
been shown that mononuclear, N-heterocyclic Fe
complexes are capable of multielectron transfer events in common organic
solvents holding some promise to be employed in a wide range of areas,
from energy storage9−14 to photovoltaic cells.15−22 The inherent stability of these complexes in low charge states has
been attributed to the chelate effect, their strong π-acceptance
qualities, as well as strong σ-donation by the N-heterocyclic
ligand.15,23−29 Mössbauer spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT)
studies have revealed that the redox noninnocence of 2,2′-bipyridine
(Bpy) and 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine (Tpy) ligands
is responsible for three of the four reductions within [Fe(Bpy)3]n and [Fe(Tpy)2]n (n = +3, +2, +1, 0, −1)
electron-transfer series, respectively.30 In principle, understanding the effects of metal–ligand bonds
and the nature of ligand noninnocence upon the redox properties of
mononuclear, N-heterocyclic Fe complexes across their multiple electron-transfer
series, could potentially shed light on design principles that will
facilitate the discovery of next-generation charge carriers for RFBs
with higher energy densities. It is therefore critical to understand
the effects that these redox-active moieties have on multielectron
events and their redox potentials within Fe complexes as a function
of the number and nature of coordinated ligands that they contain.11 It is worth noting that efforts to develop better
electrolytes for non-aqueous RFBs have mostly been empirical, from
both theoretical and experimental perspectives, with limited attempts
toward the rational design of structural, electronic, and other RFB-relevant
properties.31−33 Aqueous all-iron RFBs are described elsewhere.34

In this paper, we systematically investigated
a series of bidentate
and tridentate Fe complexes (Figure 1) with the aim of identifying complexes that are stable
across multiple charge states as well as maximizing the electrochemical
potential-to-mass ratios of such species. Since the cost of the battery
is dominated by the cost of the electrolyte in large nonaqueous systems,
any increase to the total amount of charge it can store per unit of
electrolyte will be beneficial. By lowering the mass,60 we increase the potential-to-mass ratio, thus such systems
hold promise for RFBs with higher energy densities. In this regard,
we have computationally, and in some cases, experimentally, explored
the effects of substituting pyridyl ligands with low-molecular-weight
(MW) imine groups, as well as varying the number of redox noninnocent
ligands within the first coordination sphere of a series of Fe complexes.
It is important to note that in this work, we consider only thermodynamic
properties of such species that determine the capacity of the RFBs.
In principle, kinetics (reactivity kinetics or transport kinetics)
may also impact the performance, but not the capacity of the RFBs.
We found that replacing pyridine fragments with imine groups is an
effective way to reduce the MW of complexes, whereas simultaneously
maintaining redox properties as well as the stability of these metal–ligand
complexes. Additionally, by replacing pyridine moieties with redox-innocent
solvent molecules, we have identified the minimum number of redox
noninnocent ligands required for such systems to maintain similar
redox performance as in the original unsubstituted complexes, thus
unveiling some basic principles that can be used to design low-MW
charge carriers while maintaining redox property. Specifically, it
is found that at least three pyridyl rings, two pyridyl rings in combination
with one imine moiety, or one pyridyl ring combined with two other
supporting imine fragments are necessary to promote a ligand-based
reduction event within 0 and −1 charge states, while also maintaining
Fe in its lower oxidation states, i.e., Fe1+ or Fe1+/0.

this study, n = +4 → −1.

2 Validation of the Results:
Theory vs Experiment
2.1 Published Works for Fe(Bpy)3 and
Fe(Tpy)2
To verify that our computationally obtained
structures exhibit correct electronic states, we have compared Mulliken
spin densities and multiplicities of Fe(Bpy)3 and Fe(Tpy)2 complexes with previous experimental and theoretical studies
on these compounds, which used Mössbauer spectroscopy and DFT
calculations to determine the oxidation states of Fe within the [Fe(Bpy)3]n and [Fe(Tpy)2]n (n = +3, +2, +1, 0, −1)
series.30 Overall, we found excellent agreement
for the oxidation states of Fe within both series, albeit with small
differences in spin multiplicities and electron localization patterns
among ligands. Specifically, our DFT results for the [Fe(Bpy)3]n (n = +4 →
−1) series revealed a more delocalized picture of the spin
densities, which is due to the fact that we used a generalized gradient
approximation functional, Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE),
in comparison with a hybrid functional, B3LYP, that was previously
used.30 According to the PBE calculations,
Bpy ligands almost equally shared an electron upon each reduction
step, whereas the B3LYP results showed a more localized picture with
a subsequent reduction of each Bpy ligand. High-level wavefunction-based
calculations on the [Fe(Bpy)3]2+ complex are
in accordance with our DFT calculations, confirming a singlet ground
state.35,36 While the ground state for [Fe(Bpy)3]0 species remains uncertain based on the Mössbauer
spectroscopy results,30 our calculations
showed that the triplet state of [Fe(Bpy)3]0 is more stable than the singlet state by 4.8 kcal/mol, although
the oxidation states of Fe in both triplet and singlet is the same,
i.e., 2+. Akin to the experimental results,30 our calculations showed that the doublet and quartet states of the
[Fe(Bpy)3]1– complex are energetically
indistinguishable (0.05 kcal/mol in favor of the doublet state). It
is noteworthy that in both states the metal center exhibits the 2+
oxidation state, and the 0 → −1 redox step is a ligand-based
reduction. Given the degenerate energies of the doublet and quartet
states as well as that other analogous bidentate ((Fe(α-ImPy)3 and Fe(DiIm)3)) and tridentate ((Fe(α-ImBpy)2 and Fe(DIP)2)) ligand containing complexes exhibit
high-spin ground electronic configurations in the −1 charge
state (Table S1), we use the quartet state
of [Fe(Bpy)3]1– in future discussions.
According to our PBE calculations, oxidation states of Fe for the
[Fe(Tpy)2]n (n = 0 → −1) complexes coincide with the previously reported
ones.30 The only difference is observed
for [Fe(Tpy)2]1–, wherein quartet state
is found to be 2.3 kcal/mol more stable than the doublet state, though
in both cases the metal exhibits 2+ oxidation state. Similarly to
the [Fe(Bpy)3]n (n = +4 → −1) series, PBE results did not reveal localized
spin density on each Tpy ligand upon reduction from +1 → −1,
rather that the Mulliken spin density is delocalized between both
Tpy ligands. It is noteworthy that the nature of all reduction events
from +4 → −1 (either ligand-based or metal-based) was
found to be similar regardless of the choice of functional for [Fe(Bpy)3]n and [Fe(Tpy)2]n. It is important to point out that an earlier
systematic investigation of electronic structures of various complexes
containing bipyridine ligands with transition metals showed that PBE
functional correctly predicted electronic states of the Fe bipyridine-containing
complexes, matching the results obtained from multireference CASSCF
and NEVPT2 methods.23

2.2 Theoretical and Experimental UV–Vis
Absorption Spectra of [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ in
This Work
To further validate our theoretical calculations,
we compare the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ complex, which was experimentally synthesized
and characterized in this study, with the corresponding computed absorption
spectrum shown in Figure 2. The experimental spectrum exhibits three absorption bands
at 203, 234–244, and 275–286 nm (see Figure S1 for the UV–vis spectra at various concentrations).
The simulated UV–vis spectrum has similar absorption band shapes
and shows great agreement with the experimental data, matching the
bands positions and the splittings between the corresponding peaks
within 15 nm, as shown in Table 1.

Figure 2 Theoretical and experimental absorption spectra of [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ at 32 μM. The calculated UV–vis
spectra for both [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ and [Fe(α-ImPy)3]3+ are shown in Figure S2. The vertical bars depict the oscillator strength for each excited-state
transition.

[Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ is assigned to metal-to-ligand
excitations, whereas the other two
higher energy bands (1, 2) mostly correspond to ligand-to-ligand charge
transfers.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Reduction Potentials
We have computed
the reduction potentials for all complexes illustrated in Figure 1 and compared them
with available experimental data for the charge states of +4 →
+3, +3 → +2, +2 → +1, +1 → 0, and 0 →
−1. As shown in Table 2 and Figure 3, the theoretical reduction potentials of Fe(α-ImPy)3, Fe(Bpy)3, Fe(Tpy)2, and free Bpy are all
within 0.3 V of their corresponding experimental values. This excellent
agreement between experimental and theoretical redox potential lends
us confidence to explore the impact of ligand substitutions on the
redox properties of these compounds, as is presented below in the
example of such substitutions by imine groups and MeCN molecules.

3.2 Impact
on Redox Properties upon Substituting
Pyridyl Moieties with Imine Groups
Imine group, which possesses
lower MW compared to pyridyl group, exhibits similar redox-active
properties.41 The substitution of pyridyl
moieties with imine groups may reduce mass of the charge carriers
and hence the cost of commercial systems, since the cost of any RFB
system scales with its mass.42,60 It has been previously
demonstrated that molecules bearing imine groups, such as α-imino
pyridines (α-ImPy),43 2,6-diimino
pyridines (DIPs),44−47 and closely related ligands,27,48−52 exhibit similar properties to those of N-heterocycles comprised
of more massive ligands, such as bipyridine (Bpy) and terpyridine
(Tpy).25,53−59 Given that these ligands have similar π-acceptor capacities,
but imines have inferior σ-donating properties, such substitution
may increase the reduction potentials of the high charge states because
there is less ligand stabilization. As a result, higher OV values
(determined as the sum of all redox potentials within the entire electron-transfer
series) can be expected, and hence, greater energy density for RFBs.
Also, the introduction of imine groups may be used for further functionalization
of the complexes at the imine nitrogen atom that could be used to
potentially increase solubility. Thus, in addition to lowering MW,
such substitution gives experimentalists another knob to balance MW
with solubility. The overall energy density of the battery is also
dependent on the solubility. Currently, a systematic study on this
topic is being undertaken, and the results will be reported
in future works.

To address the effects of ligand substitutions
on the redox properties of the complexes, we employed Mulliken spin
density analysis for all MeCN-free Fe coordination compounds depicted
in Figure 1. In this
analysis, compounds are grouped together by the type of the ligand
coordinated to the metal center, in which pyridyl ligands are sequentially
substituted by imine fragments, as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Average Mulliken spin densities on Fe, imine,
and pyridine moieties.
The subplots are organized by the sequential substitution of each
pyridyl by an imine group starting with (a) Fe(Bpy)3 and
(b) Fe(Tpy)2.

Beginning with the analysis of complexes supported by three
bidentate
ligands, the average Mulliken spin densities on the Fe center and
the bidentate ligands within the Fe(Bpy)3, Fe(α-ImPy)3, and Fe(DiIm)3 compounds can be viewed in Figure 4a (tabulated values
are shown in Tables S2–S4). According
to these data, the Fe center is reduced in the +4 → +2 steps,
whereas primarily ligands get reduced in the +2 → −1
steps for all complexes. The +2 charge state corresponds to the closed-shell
low-spin ground state of a Fe2+ system, hence the net Mulliken
spin density is equal to zero. Considering the trends across the series,
one can deduce the nature of the redox event (metal or ligand based)
as well as identify the oxidation state of the metal center. Since
a pyridyl group is a better σ-donor than an imine group, at
the highest charge state of +4, the fully substituted Fe(DiIm)3 complex exhibits a rare oxidation state of +4 on Fe, whereas
Fe(Bpy)3 and Fe(α-ImPy)3 show an intermediate
oxidation state of Fe3+/4+. For all three complexes, the
oxidation state of the Fe centers coincides with their charge states
at +3 and +2, respectively. In contrast, it takes on an intermediate
state of Fe2+/1+ within the lower charge states from +2
to −1.

Although the pyridyl and imine functional groups
exhibit similar
π-acceptance capacities, Bpy ligands in Fe(Bpy)3 possess
slightly more spin density than the α-ImPy and DiIm ligands
in Fe(α-ImPy)3 and Fe(DiIm)3 in their
lowest (−1) charge states (0.91, 0.83, 0.73 spin densities
on each ligand). Overall, we observe that the number of the redox
events is preserved upon the pyridyl-to-imine substitution, as is
the qualitative redox performance. In addition, complete ligand substitution
decreases the MW by 20 and 40% in Fe(α-ImPy)3 and
Fe(DiIm)3, respectively (Table 2), thus lowering the molecular weight-to-charge
ratios and increasing the likelihood of meeting cost targets for RFBs.60 It is noted that these considerations of the
MW apply only for the charge carriers, without accounting for masses
of the counter ions and the solvent, which are present in the whole
RFB systems. More importantly, such substitution increases the OV
values by as much as 1.14 V (from 9.01 V in Fe(Bpy)3 to
9.16 V in Fe(α-ImPy)3 and to 10.15 V in Fe(DiIm)3). In principle, such imine-substituted complexes may harvest/release
more energy and subsequently increase the energy density of RFBs.
Although not all redox events reported in the full theoretical range
(+4 → −1) can exist within the EW of MeCN ({−3.25
to 2.5 V} versus Fc+/Fc under current experimental conditions
as compared to the previously reported {−2.6 to 2.9 V} window,61Figure S3), they
can potentially be observed in MeCN solutions doped with 0.1 M ionic
liquids (ILs), which can widen the EW of solution, as previously suggested.62 Specifically, it was previously shown that the
introduction of the trifluorotris-(pentafluoroethyl)phosphate-based
ILs as supporting electrolyte in MeCN solution can expand the oxidative
window by up to 0.8 V, thus providing an opportunity to investigate
compounds that are known to oxidize at high potentials.62 In principle, using low concentration of ILs
may help experimentalists access higher oxidation states without appreciable
increase of the overall MW for RFB. These theoretical insights are
currently being systematically evaluated and will be part of the future
work.

By further analyzing complexes containing tridentate ligands,
i.e.,
Fe(Tpy)2, Fe(α-ImBpy)2, and Fe(DIP)2, we found that the trends in their reduction behavior, spin
delocalization, and OV values closely match those of their tris-bidentate
ligand counterparts (Figure 4b and Tables S5–S7). Mulliken
spin density analysis indicates that primarily metal-centered reduction
events occur within the +4 → +2 steps of the electron-transfer
series, whereas the ligands get reduced in the +2 → −1
steps. Similar to the series of complexes containing bidentate ligands,
the Bpy ligands possess a greater amount of spin than the DiIm and
α-ImPy ligands, though this difference is much smaller in magnitude
for the complexes containing tridentate ligands because they each
bear at least one pyridyl group. As a result, in the highest charge
state of +4, Fe exhibits an intermediate oxidation state of +3/+4,
even for the fully substituted Fe(DIP)2. On the other hand,
within the lower charge states (+2 → −1), the oxidation
state of Fe is still in between the +2 and +1 values. It is noteworthy
that upon pyridyl group substitution by an imine moiety, the OV values
increase from 8.82 V in Fe(Tpy)2 to 9.08 V in Fe(α-ImBpy)2 and further to 9.41 V in Fe(DIP)2. At the same
time, the MW decreases by 13% in Fe(α-ImBpy)2 and
27% in Fe(DIP)2 relative to that of Fe(Tpy)2.

Comparing complexes with bidentate and tridentate ligands,
it is
evident that the completely imine (for pyridyl group)-substituted
complexes of the former set not only have lower MWs, but larger OV
values (10.15 vs 9.41 V), while still preserving all redox events
and performance within the +4 → −1 charge states. Overall,
in considering all six complexes mentioned above, it was found that
the average spin densities on the imine and pyridyl groups in their
corresponding Fe complexes are very similar within each charge state.
Hence, we believe that the imine for pyridyl group substitution is
a potentially useful approach for the design of efficient charge carriers
with lower MWs.

3.3 Impact of Number of Redox
Noninnocent Ligands
on Redox Properties
As described above in the example of
the pyridyl-to-imine substitution, lowering the MW by substituting
heavier redox noninnocent ligands with lighter counterparts is a potentially
promising approach to reduce cost of RFBs,42 increase their solubility, and hence improve their efficiency.
To further explore the effects of this substitution, we attempt to
answer two questions: “is it possible to further reduce the
MW of such complexes?” and “what is the smallest number
of the redox noninnocent ligands that are needed to maintain the same
redox performance as in the parent species?” To answer these
questions, we substitute the redox noninnocent ligands in the complexes
presented in Figure 1 by redox-innocent ligands, i.e., MeCN molecules, which could coordinate
to the metal center to form similar octahedral complexes. Through
this theoretical exercise, substitution of the ligands by MeCN may
shed light on understanding the possibility of keeping the same redox
performance (number and type of redox events) in complexes with a
reduced number of redox noninnocent ligands as well as determine the
minimum possible number of such ligands required for desirable redox
properties. Hence, we theoretically explored the redox behavior of
various MeCN-coordinated species for all charge states from +4 to
−1 (Figure 5). We assessed the changes in their geometries as well as the redox
properties across the whole electron-transfer series in relation to
their parent complexes. Coordination of MeCN molecules to the
Fe center has already been reported for a number of Fe-complex crystal
structures containing pyridyl and imine moieties that resemble those
considered in this study. For instance, (acetonitrile)-diaqua-(2,6-bis(4,4-dimethyl-4,5-dihydro-1,3-oxazol-2-yl)pyridine)-iron(II)bis(tetrafluoroborate)100 and (acetonitrile)-diaqua-(N,N'-((pyridine-2,6-diyl)dieth-1-yl-1-ylidene)bis(2,6-diisopropylaniline))-iron(ii)bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate)200 hexacoordinate complexes contain one DIP-like
tridentate ligand, one MeCN and two H2O molecules coordinated
to the Fe metal. Similar DIP-like tetradentate ligand forms equatorial
bonding with a Fe2+ center, which is coordinated to two
MeCN molecules in axial positions.300 Other
tetradentate complex contains two functionalized DiIm moieties in
equatorial positions with one MeCN and one CO molecules coordinating
axially to Fe.400 All these complexes serve
as examples of Fe-containing complexes that can form coordination
bonds with MeCN molecules. Hence, it illustrates the importance of
understanding redox properties of MeCN-coordinated complexes, such
as those considered in this study.

the imine group, and the
pyridine group. The subplots are organized by the number of noninnocent
ligands for: (a) DiIm complexes, (b) α-ImPy complexes, (c) Bpy
complexes, (d) DIP complexes, (e) α-ImBpy complexes, and (f)
Tpy complexes.

We first begin by addressing
variations in the average Mulliken
spin density on Fe, imine fragments, and pyridyl fragments within
different charge states, as the number of the noninnocent ligands
varies. One can see that the average Fe, imine, and pyridyl spin densities
do not significantly vary with the number of the ligands within higher
charge states, +4 → +2. In contrast, the average Mulliken spin
densities on these fragments differ noticeably within the lower charge
states, +2 → −1. Specifically, upon MeCN substitution,
two different redox behaviors are noticed for complexes containing
different numbers of ligands. Compounds (Figure 5a–c) supported by two bidentate ligands
(i.e., one ligand is substituted by two MeCNs) show a substantial
increase in the average spin density on each imine group and pyridyl
ring, whereas the average spin density on the Fe center remains nearly
constant (Tables S8–S10). That is
especially pronounced for complexes containing one or more pyridyl
ligand. This trend in spin density behavior indicates that the ligands
are getting reduced as opposed to the metal center. The reverse observation
is true for compounds with one bidentate ligand (i.e., two ligands
are now substituted by four MeCNs), indicating that the Fe center
is primarily reduced. On one hand, MeCN substitution to the second
ligand results in lower π-acceptance capacities, requiring that
the metal center accepts more electron density within the low charge
states. On the other hand, a more electron-rich metal center also
favors the displacement of MeCN molecules, as less electron donation
is now required at the metal center. As a consequence, Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4, Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4, and Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4 complexes dissociate two MeCN molecules within their 0 and
−1 charge states (Tables S11–S13) and adopt planar tetracoordinate geometries. Overall, ligand substitution
by MeCN not only preserves all the redox events within the +4 →
−1 charge states, but also increases the OV values for all
three bidentate complexes by: 1.62 V from Fe(Bpy)3 to Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4, 1.06 V from Fe(α-ImPy)3 to Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4, and 0.89 V from Fe(DiIm)3 to Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4. Concomitantly, the MW of these complexes decreases by 28,
35, and 41%, respectively. Comparing all six complexes wherein at
least one bidentate ligand is substituted by MeCNs, i.e., Fe(Bpy)2(MeCN)2, Fe(α-ImPy)2(MeCN)2, Fe(DiIm)2(MeCN)2, Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4, Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4, and Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4, it is evident that complexes with the same number of MeCNs
exhibit larger OV values when they possess imine groups, thus also
supporting the results obtained for the MeCN-free complexes upon pyridyl
group substitution by imine fragments.

In a similar vein to
the MeCN-free complexes, Bpy ligands possess
a greater amount of spin than the DiIm and α-ImPy ligands across
the electron-transfer series, and this difference gets progressively
larger with an increasing number of MeCN molecules. This is particularly
pronounced for the +4 charge state, in which the Fe centers of Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4 and Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4 possess a mixed valence
+3/+4 oxidation state, whereas the Fe center of Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4 is in a +3 oxidation state. As an exception, within the +2
→ +1 charge states, the DiIm and α-ImPy ligands exhibit
slightly better π-acceptor abilities than Bpy, resulting in
ligand-based reduction within the Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4 and Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4 complexes, but Fe-based reduction in the Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4 complex.

Ligand substitution within complexes supported
by tridentate ligands
does not drastically change their redox behavior. Akin to the MeCN-free
parent complexes, compounds containing one tridentate ligand (i.e.,
one ligand substituted by three MeCNs) exhibit ligand-based reductions
within the +2 → −1 charge states, whereas the spin densities
on Fe centers stay almost the same (Figure 5d–f). At the same time, solvent-coordinated
Fe(Tpy)(MeCN)3, Fe(α-ImBpy)(MeCN)3, and
Fe(DIP)(MeCN)3 complexes have larger OV values and smaller
MWs than their unsubstituted counterparts. Specifically, the former
increase by 0.80, 0.70, and 0.60 V, whereas the latter decrease by
21, 27, and 34%, respectively. In comparing these three MeCN-substituted
complexes, one can observe that the OV values increase with increasing
number of imine groups, in accordance with the imine for pyridyl trend
found for MeCN-free counterparts. In a similar manner to Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4, Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4, and Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4, these tridentate complexes also dissociate “excess”
electron-donor molecules of MeCN within the 0 and −1 charge
states, but to a smaller extent, due to the stronger π-acceptor
capacity of the tridentate ligands (only one MeCN is pushed out of
the first coordination sphere, as shown in Tables S14–S16), resulting in five-coordinate complexes. The
difference in the reduction schemes within the low charge states in
all of these complexes can be explained by the number and type of
the π-acceptors (pyridyl or imine fragment) capable
of accepting electrons within the low charge states. Obviously, complexes
with three (Fe(Tpy)(MeCN)3, Fe(α-ImBpy)(MeCN)3, Fe(DIP)(MeCN)3) or four (Fe(Bpy)2(MeCN)2, Fe(α-ImPy)2(MeCN)2, and Fe(DiIm)2(MeCN)2) π-acceptors have stronger π-acceptance
capabilities than complexes with two such fragments (Fe(Bpy)(MeCN)4, Fe(α-ImPy)(MeCN)4, and Fe(DiIm)(MeCN)4). It can thus be concluded that in most cases of MeCN-ligand
substitution, either at least three pyridyl rings, two pyridyl rings
and one imine moiety, or one pyridyl ring and two imine fragments
are necessary for stabilization via ligand reduction within low charge
states. Any other such ligand combination, wherein the number of π-acceptor
fragments is less than three, would result in an Fe-based reduction
event. Overall, considering all bidentate and tridentate MeCN-containing
complexes, it was found that the Fe(Bpy)2(MeCN)2, Fe(α-ImPy)2(MeCN)2, and Fe(DiIm)2(MeCN)2 complexes maintain their geometries at
each reduction event, hence holding potential to be used within the
entire +4 → −1 electron-transfer series. It is worth
noting that the MeCN-substitution exercise is mainly to assess the
ability of these systems to function as the number of redox noninnocent
ligands decreases, and it does not address the stability or concentration
of a particular substituted species in the RFB scenarios. Instead,
it helps us demonstrate that such complexes can maintain the redox
behavior similar to their parent species, if they ever happen to be
formed under certain experimental conditions.

Next, we assessed
the effects of different numbers of redox noninnocent
ligands on Fe–NIm, Fe–NPy, and
Fe–NMeCN bond lengths as a function of charge state.
These results are depicted in Figure 6. Overall, one can see that the Fe–N distances
do not change significantly within the entire electron-transfer series
for all bidentate and tridentate ligand containing complexes considered
in our study (maximum deviation equals to 0.15 Å). Due to the
differences in σ-donating properties of imine and pyridyl groups,
MeCN-free complexes exhibit somewhat larger changes in the Fe–NPy and Fe–NIm distances within their high
charge states (+4 → +2), rather than within their lower (+2
→ −1) charges states, i.e., 0.02–0.05 versus
0.01–0.02 Å. As expected, complexes with a larger number
of imine moieties (Fe(DiIm)3 and Fe(DIP)3) exhibit
larger deviations in the Fe–N distances within the high charge
states as compared to their parent unsubstituted counterparts (Table S17). In contrast, complexes containing
coordinated MeCNs exhibit greater changes in Fe–N distances
within the whole series. Specifically, although the Fe–NPy and Fe–NIm distances vary in the range
of 0.01–0.07 Å, the Fe–NMeCN distances
exhibit greater deviations, i.e., 0.11–0.15 Å. In most
of the cases, the deviations in the Fe–N distances become noticeably
greater as the number of bound MeCN molecules is increased. However,
the most pronounced changes in the Fe–NMeCN distances
are observed within the 0 and −1 charge states due to the displacement
of one or two MeCNs during the +1 → −1 reduction steps,
as the bidentate and tridentate complexes with one redox noninnocent
ligand adopt four- and five-coordinate geometries, respectively. In
such cases, the Fe–NMeCN distances decrease by 0.08–0.14
Å to compensate. Except these few cases wherein MeCN molecules
are displaced in low charge states, most complexes studied in this
paper maintain their geometries, while exhibiting only small changes
across the charge state series.

4 Conclusions
Herein, we have systematically investigated a series of redox noninnocent
ligands to gain fundamental knowledge about low-MW Fe complexes, potentially
capable of promoting multiple, one-electron redox events. Specifically,
we have computationally investigated the role of coordination geometries
and the nature of redox noninnocence upon substituting pyridyl groups
with imine fragments and also by varying the number of the noninnocent
ligands present within the first coordination sphere of the metal
center. Our calculations show that pyridyl group substitution with
an imine moiety is an effective way to lower the MW of charge carriers,
while apparently maintaining the redox properties and metal–ligand
bonding characteristics. This observation is confirmed by the experimental
results of the Fe(α-ImPy)3 complex, which demonstrates
an excellent agreement with theory for the four experimental reduction
potentials within the +3 → −1 charge states. In a similar
fashion to the parent pyridyl group containing complexes, calculations
point to such imine containing derivatives primarily exhibiting metal-based
reductions within high charge states (+4 → +2) and ligand-based
reductions within lower charge states (+2 → −1). For
all examined complexes, we found that although the imine and pyridyl
groups exhibited similar redox noninnocent behavior within the low
charge states, the Fe center was stabilized differently within the
+4 charge state. Specifically, the pyridyl groups promoted either
a +3 or an intermediate +3/+4 oxidation state of Fe, whereas the presence
of imine groups stabilized the metal at the rare +4 state. This helped
increase reduction potentials for the +4 → +3 step in the Fe
complexes containing a larger number of imine groups. Overall, we
found that for all MeCN-free complexes, pyridyl group substitution
appreciably increases their OV values up to 1.14 and 0.59 V for bidentate
and tridentate complexes, whereas reducing the molecular weight by
40 and 27%, respectively.

By examining the effect of redox-innocent
ligand, MeCN, we observed
that within high charge states (+4 → +2), Fe complexes with
only one redox noninnocent ligand were also capable of multielectron
reduction events, and these exhibited reduction potentials similar
to their analogs supported by two or three redox noninnocent ligands,
suggesting metal-based reduction. However, two different redox behaviors
were noticed for complexes containing bidentate and tridentate ligands
within lower charge states (+2 → −1). Specifically,
Fe complexes supported by two redox noninnocent bidentate ligands,
or one redox noninnocent tridentate ligand, exhibited ligand-based
reductions, whereas corresponding compounds containing one bidentate
ligand exhibited a metal-based reduction due to the significantly
decreased number of π-acceptor groups. Additionally, our calculations
show that for any Fe species wherein a pyridyl moiety is substituted
by MeCN ligands, a combination of at least three pyridyl rings, two
pyridyl rings with one imine, or one pyridyl ring with two imines
is necessary for complex stabilization via ligand-based reduction
within low charge states. It is also worth noting that among all MeCN-coordinated
complexes only Fe(Bpy)2(MeCN)2, Fe(α-ImPy)2(MeCN)2, and Fe(DiIm)2(MeCN)2 complexes maintain structural integrity at each reduction step,
thus holding potential to be used in RFBs within the entire +4 →
−1 series. Other MeCN-substituted complexes may encounter structural
stability issues in 0 and −1 charge states due to displacement
of MeCNs, hence resulting in a decreased redox window, i.e., +4 →
+1. Thus, our theoretical results have pointed to the possibility
of maintaining similar redox properties within complexes with a decreased
number of noninnocent ligands and identified the minimum number of
such ligands needed to preserve the overall redox performance. We
believe that these findings can potentially point toward the rationale
design of new Fe-based complexes with lower MWs and larger OV values,
which can be used to create more cost competitive RFBs with higher
energy densities.

5 Methods
5.1 Computational
Details
The reduction
potentials of all Fe complexes and free ligands were computed using
the revised Born–Haber cycle, described elsewhere,63 in which all reduction steps are referenced
to a calculated absolute half-cell potential of a ferrocene couple,
i.e., Fc0 + An → Fc+ + An–1, as opposed to
an experimental standard reference electrode, such as the standard
hydrogen electrode or the saturated calomel electrode (SCE). All calculations
were carried out with Gaussian 09 software package (version D.01).64 The PBE functional65,66 was utilized as it does not require the application of a correction
term to the theoretical reduction potential, as suggested previously.63 In addition, recent studies23 have revealed that the PBE functional was less likely to
show artificial charge separation in complexes with redox noninnocent
ligands. The LANL2DZ effective core potential basis set67 was employed for Fe, the 6-311G(d) basis set
was used for the C and N, and 6-31G was used for H atoms. Geometry
optimizations of all compounds were performed in the gas phase, whereas
single point energies in MeCN were obtained using a self-consistent
reaction field approach based on the integral equation formalism of
the polarized continuum model (PCM)68−70 level of theory, implemented
as the default PCM method in Gaussian 09.71 Frequency calculations were performed to ensure that the optimized
geometries represented minima along the potential energy surface for
each compound. All possible multiplicities were considered for the
studied complexes within each charge state. The vertical transition
energies to 50 excited states of [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+ were computed using spin-unrestricted time-dependent-DFT72 with the LC-ωPBE functional.73 Excited-state transitions were visualized using
the absorption’s half-width at half-height of 0.10 eV. Natural
transition orbital74 analysis was used
to describe the nature of the charge transfer.

5.2 Experimental
Details
5.2.1 Synthesis Details of [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+
[(α-ImPy)3Fe]2+ has been synthesized as ClO4– and PF6– complexes for kinetic measurements
of isomerization75,76 and acid hydrolysis77,78 as well as for cyclic voltammetry.79,80 The pseudo-octahedral
core has been found to adopt both mer and fac isomers (Figure S4) and to equilibrate these isomers in
solution, with the mer isomer being the dominant species. As with
the previously reported complexes, the trifluoromethanesulfonate (OTf–) salt reported herein exhibits 1H NMR data
consistent with low-spin Fe(II). MeCN (Aldrich, anhydrous grade) and
diethyl ether (Aldrich, anhydrous grade) were stored over 4 Å
molecular sieves in an Ar-filled glovebox. Pyridine-2-aldehyde was
vacuum transferred immediately prior to use. Metal complexes were
synthesized and stored in an Ar-filled glovebox. N-(2-Pyridinylmethylene)-methanamine (α-ImPy) was synthesized
as has been reported in the literature.81 All other reagents were purchased commercially and used as-received. 1H NMR spectra (Figures S5–S7) were obtained on a Bruker AV400 spectrometer and referenced to
either the residual solvent (MeCN-d3:
1.94 ppm) or tetramethylsilane (0 ppm). UV–vis spectra were
obtained on an Agilent 8453 spectrometer equipped with a Peltier temperature
controller set to 25 °C. Elemental analysis was performed by
Atlantic Microlab (Norcross, GA).

5.2.1.1 [(α-ImPy)3Fe][OTf]2
α-ImPy (5.0 g, 42 mmol)
was added to ca. 100
mL of MeCN in a 250 mL flask with stirring. To this solution, Fe[OTf]2 (4.9 g, 14 mmol) was added, resulting in the immediate formation
of a dark purple solution. This reaction mixture was left stirring
overnight and then filtered through Celite. The filtrate was concentrated
in vacuo, and the product was crystallized via diethyl ether diffusion,
collected on a glass frit, and washed with diethyl ether (9.4 g, 95%). 1H NMR (MeCN-d3) δ 9.13–8.91
(m, 3H, CH=N), 8.27–6.98 (m, 12H, Py), 3.37–2.95
(m, 9H, CH3). UV–vis (MeCN) λmax (nm): 203, 239, 280, 354, 506 (sh), 550. Anal. calcd for C23H24N6O6S2F6Fe: C, 38.67; H, 3.39; N, 11.76; F, 15.96. Found: C, 38.89; H, 3.33;
N, 11.59; F, 15.73.

5.2.2 Cyclic Voltammetry: [Fe(α-ImPy)3]2+
All manipulations were performed in
a drybox (MBraun) using solvents dried with purification columns from
Glasscontour (Laguna Beach, CA) and water content verified with Karl
Fischer titration (Mettler-Toledo, C20, using NIST traceable standards).
A Metrohm potentiostat (PGSTAT204) was used for cyclic voltammetry
and bulk electrolysis. CV was performed using a three-electrode cell
(BASI), equipped with a glassy carbon working (BASI, 3.0 mm diameter),
Pt coil counter (BASI, 23 cm), and nonaqueous Ag reference electrodes
(BASI) filled with 0.01 M AgNO3 or AgBF4/MeCN
solution. A supporting electrolyte of 0.1 M Bu4NPF6 in MeCN was the medium. CV scans were only performed in the
cathodic (positive potentials) or anodic direction. Data transformations
were performed within the Nova software package (version 2.1) on the
second scan, raw data are shown in Figures S8–S13.
