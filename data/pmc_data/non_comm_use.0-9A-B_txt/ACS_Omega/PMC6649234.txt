The
ability to detect and selectively identify trace amounts of
metal ions is of major importance for drinking water identification
and biological studies. Herein, we report a series of water-soluble
Schiff-base ligands capable of being fluorescent and colorimetric
sensors for metal ions. Upon coordination of the metal ion to the
ligand, quenching of fluorescence is observed, typically in a 1:1
ratio. The selectivity of metal ions Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, and Co2+ is exhibited via fluorescence
quenching accompanied by colorimetric changes, whereas that of Ag+ and Co2+ is observed through colorimetric changes
alone. Additionally, pH sensing studies were performed for the potential
use of these ligands in biological applications.

Introduction
Metal ions are of great importance in
the realm of biology and
environmental chemistry.1 In the field
of biology, metal ions are essential elements that function in the
human body as cofactors, metabolic regulators, and oxygen transporters.2,3 Despite the important roles of metal ions, the accumulation or deficiency
of certain metal ions can cause a series of severe diseases. For example,
cobalt, a cofactor of vitamin B12, leads to cardiac arrest
when accumulated in excess4 and chromium,
a metal ion used for the regulation of glucose, in deficiency causes
elevated levels of glucose in blood and urine.5 One of the ways that dangerous levels of metal ions enter our bodies
is through contaminated drinking water via the erosion of natural
deposits.6,7 In certain cases, this can prove to be toxic
upon consumption as recently seen in the highly publicized lead-contaminated
drinking water crisis of Flint, Michigan.8−10 For these reasons,
the synthesis and design of reliable molecular sensors for the detection
of metal ions are of great importance.

A variety of sensors
have been reported for the detection of metal
ions including the use of high-resolution differential surface plasmon
resonance sensors,11 acid-free synthesis
of high-quality graphene quantum dots for aggregation-induced sensing,12 electrochemical sensors,13−16 and fluorescent and colorimetric
sensors.17,18 Among the various detection techniques available,
detections through fluorescence changes or colorimetric changes are
the most convenient methods because of the sensitivity and ease of
use, respectively.19,20

Much success has been shown
in using fluorescent or colorimetric
sensors to detect metal ions in aqueous media to include Cu2+, Zn2+, and Fe3+ 21 and heavy metal ions Pt2+,22 Pb2+, Cd2+, and Hg2+.17,18 Although many of these sensors successfully detect trace amounts
of metal ions in water, the high carbon-to-hydrogen bonding atom ratio
for many of these molecules ironically makes them insoluble in pure
aqueous media, a factor which is absolutely necessary for biological
applications. Therefore, designing water-soluble sensors capable of
detecting metal ions in pure aqueous media is advantageous.

Recently, Zhou et al. showed the addition of sulfonyl groups on
the salen backbone of a Schiff-base greatly increases the water solubility
of the molecule.23 A Schiff-base is a compound
obtained from a one-step, one-pot condensation reaction of an aldehyde
or ketone with an amine.24 One of the most
utilized examples of a Schiff-base is the salen ligand (Figure 1) which is derived from a diamine
combined with 2 equiv of salicylaldehyde.

Figure 1 Salen Ligand and salen
ligand complexed to a metal ion (M).

The salen ligand has two covalent and two coordinate covalent
sites
orientated in planar geometry making it ideal for the equatorial coordination
of transition metal ions while still having two open axial sites for
additional bonding as shown in Figure 1.25 Additionally, this ligand
and its derivatives are easy and inexpensive to prepare.26 Although the most common use for salen ligands
is for enantioselective catalysis,27−30 they are also valuable in coordinating
many different types of metal ions in various oxidation states.27

Aromatic Schiff-bases are highly sought
after as sensors because
of the fluorescent complexes they make through nitrogen, oxygen, and
sulfur donor atoms.22,25,31 Additionally, Schiff-bases are known to have biological activities
such as anticancer activity32,33 which tends to increase
when complexed with metal ions.34 Much
efforts have been made to synthesize fluorescent Schiff-base compounds
which are selective, sensitive, water soluble, and suited for monitoring
biological processes.21,35−38 Currently, the length of these
Schiff-base sensors are limited to two carbons in the amine linker.
Access to longer length amine linker could expand the possibility
of complexing larger metal ions or metal complexes. For example, Signorella
et al. recently showed antioxidant activity with a water-soluble Mn(III)
sulphonato-substituted Schiff-base ligand using a three-carbon backbone
linker.39 In addition, the pH sensing application
of these Schiff-base derivatives are rarely reported, despite the
fact that they are simple and common. Herein, we report a series of
water-soluble sulfonyl Schiff-bases including a three- and four-carbon
chain linker capable of detecting common metal ions found in drinking
water using fluorescence and colorimetric changes. Furthermore, we
investigate the pH sensing ranges of these ligands for possible use
in biological applications.

Results and Discussion
Physical Properties of
Ligands
Studies began with the
well-established synthesis of the sulfono aldehyde (1)36 followed by the condensation of 1 with the respective diamine linkers (2) to
afford ligands L1–L4 (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Chemical Synthesis and Structure of L1–L4
With ultraviolet (UV) light
excitation, the ligands absorb and
emit in the blue-green range of the visible spectrum giving an excitation
spectrum in the 320−450 nm range and an emission spectrum in
the 430–500 nm range, as seen in Figure 2. As expected, under longer wavelength light,
the higher energy L1 emits blue, whereas L2–L4 emit green (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Excitation and emission
spectra of L1–L4. Excitation spectra
are shown with dashed lines; emission spectra are shown with solid
lines. Picture insets show L1–L4 irradiated with long wavelength
light. L1 emits blue, whereas L2–L4 emit green. Concentrations
for L1 are 10 μM in deionized (DI) water and 1 mM in DI water
for L2–L4.

A summary of the UV/vis
absorption spectral data for L1–L4
is listed in Table 1. Of the four ligands, L1 had the highest quantum yield when excited
with UV light with a value of 0.330 as compared to 0.055, 0.002, and
0.002 for L2, L3, and L4, respectively. The vast difference in quantum
yield of L1 from L2−L4 may be due to the additional conjugation
from the phenyl ring of the amine linker. The higher quantum yield
of L1 allows for more sensitive quenching studies, whereas red-shifted
ligands L2–L4 allow for emission detection in a lower energy
region of the visible spectrum.

The effects of tautomerization
in 2-hydroxy Schiff bases have been
extensively studied and are essential to their biological and chemical
properties.40−45 The tautomeric forms which can exist in equilibrium for L1–L4
are the phenol-imine and the keto-amine tautomers as shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Phenol-imine and keto-amine
tautomeric equilibria expected for
L1–L4 in solution.

UV–vis spectroscopy can be used to determine the existence
of tautomerism within a molecule since the keto and the phenol form
will absorb at different wavelengths. It has been reported that the
formation of a new higher wavelength band (generally >400 nm) in
the
presence of polar solvents indicates the presence of the keto-amine
isomer of Schiff-base.46Figure 4 shows two distinct bands observed
at wavelengths 280–360 nm (phenol-imine) and 360–450
nm (keto-amine) for L4.

Figure 4 Absorption spectrum of L4 in an array of polar
solvents.

In polar solvents dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), acetonitrile (CH3CN), ethanol (EtOH), dimethylformamide
(DMF), and tetrahydrofuran
(THF), the phenol-imine tautomer is dominant for L4. The percentages
of the keto-amine tautomer determined in solution via UV–vis46,47 for L2–L4 are given in Table 2.

When water is the solvent, the absorption
max peak of the dominant
tautomer shifts from 325 to 380 nm indicating that in aqueous media,
the keto-amine isomer is the dominant and active form. L2 and L3 also
show the keto-amine isomer as the dominant and active form and the
spectra of these ligands are shown in Figure S1. The absorption bands for L1 were not distinct for the relative
isomers (see Figure S2); however, the absorption
was below 400 nm, indicating that L1 largely exist in the phenol-imine
isomer.

Fluorescence Quenching Studies with Ligands
Quenching
studies began by testing the sensory levels of the ligands with common
metal ions found in water (Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Co2+, Pb2+, Cd2+, As5+, and Ag+). The effects of 1 equiv of metal ions
on fluorescence intensity of L1–L4 are shown in Figure 5. All ligands were titrated
with up to 4 equiv of the respective metal ions as shown in Figure S2. Because of the higher quantum yield
and preferred phenol-imine tautomeric form of L1, measurements for
L1 were 10 μM, whereas those for L2–L4 were 1 mM.

Figure 5 Effect of different
metal ions on the fluorescence intensity of
L1 (10 μm) and L2–L4 (1 mM) in a 1:1 ratio. Emission
spectra of the ligands in the presence of 1 equiv of varying metals.

Metal ions Cu2+, Ni2+, and Co2+ quench all four ligands with Cu2+ completely quenching
the fluorescence intensity for all four ligands. Surprisingly, the
fluorescence for L2–L4 were quenched by Pb2+ and
Cr3+, whereas L1 showed a slight increase in fluorescence
intensity when complexed to Pb2+ and almost a doubling
in intensity for Cr3+. The increase in fluorescence intensity
for L1 is most likely attributed to the complexation of these metal
ions with the phenol-amine tautomer forming a different complex from
that of the keto-amine tautomer preferred by L2–L4. Metal ions
Cd2+, As5+, and Ag+ did not show
a significant change in the fluorescence intensity for all of the
respective ligands.

Control experiments that were run using
counterions F–, Cl–, I–, NO2–, and NO3– showed no quenching
of fluorescence
in the presence of ligands (Figure S3),
suggesting that the quenching of the ligands is from the complexation
of the indicated respective metal ions. Additionally, ionic strength
studies were performed with all four ligands in the presence of 1000,
100, 10, and 1 mM solutions of NaCl, Na2SO4,
MgCl2, and MgSO4. Overall, the ligands did not
display significant changes in the sensing potential of the metal
ions in the presence of these ions (see Figure S4). A blue shift of the emission spectrum occurred for L2–L4
as the ionic strength increased for the magnesium salts; however,
the intensity of the emission spectrum remained the same and the ligands
were still quenched by the metal ions. An example of this is shown
in Figure S5 with L2 still being effectively
quenched in the presence of increasing equivalents of Cu2+.

Colorimetric Quenching Studies with Ligands
Certain
advantages for each ligand lie within its ability to identify which
metal ion is present by using a combination of fluorescence intensity
and colorimetric change. A photo of all ligands in the presence of
1 equiv of different metal ions under UV–vis and daylight is
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Photographs
of L1 (10 μM) and L2–L4 (1 mM) (a) under
long wavelength light excitation and (b) under daylight upon addition
of 1 equiv of varying metal ions.

In the case of L1 under long wavelength light excitation,
quenching
with Cu2+ selectively changes the color from blue to green
and for Ni2+ and Co2+, L1 changes from blue
to red (Figure 6a).
L2 turns red when quenched with 1 equiv of Ni2+ compared
to clear when quenched with 1 equiv of Co2+. L3 and L4
do not show significant changes in color under long wavelength light
excitation upon the addition of metal ions with the exception of Cu2+ in which the solution turns clear. While significant changes
in fluorescent color is not detectable for L3 and L4, one advantage
of L3 and L4 over L1 and L2 is their ability to access the 450–650
nm range of the visible spectrum which is advantageous for other possible
sensing applications. Colorimetric changes seen by the naked eye are
shown in Figure 6b.
A significant color change is seen for all of the ligands in the presence
of Ag+ in which the solutions change to an orange or reddish-orange
color.

Competitive reactions between metal ions, such as 1 equiv
of Cu2+ and Cr3+ with L1, did not lead to the
ability
to selectively identify which metal ions were present. L1 in the presence
of Cu2+ and Cr3+ showed a decrease in fluorescence
intensity of L1 but did not completely quench the ligand as in the
case of 1 equiv of Cu2+ alone (see Figure S6). Further distinction could not be concluded by
colorimetric changes via UV–vis and daylight.

Detection Limitations
of Ligands
To address the concerns
of obtaining safe drinking water, the Clean Water Act was established
in 197248 which allows the Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) to implement limitations of metal ions that
can become toxic at certain concentrations.49 To evaluate practical applicability, the detection limits of L1–L4
was evaluated. Knowing which metal ions effectively quenched the ligands,
we looked at the limits to quenching. According to the EPA, copper
has a maximum contaminant level (MCL) of 1.3 ppm (1.3 μM), cadmium
has an MCL of 5.0 ppb (5.0 nM), and chromium has an MCL of 0.1 ppm
(0.1 μM or 100 nM).

L1 can detect as low as 1 μM
with the instrument at maximum parameters (see Figure S7). Therefore, this ligand can be used for the detection
of MCL of copper in drinking water which is consistent with a previous
report.8 Ligands L2–L4 can detect
as low as 2–5 μM (see Figure S4), which is outside the range of MCL detection of copper, cadmium,
and chromium. The fact that the phenyl ring linker in L1 increases
the sensitivity of Schiff-base ligands suggests that designing a ligand
with addition conjugated systems in the aromatic rings of L2–L4
may allow for a higher quantum yield and increase the probability
to reach the MCL for additional metal ions.

Biological Application
Studies
The primary advantages
of ligands L1–L4 are they are water soluble and fluorescent,
making them appealing for biological applications. The possibilities
to explore the ligand for biological purposes were examined through
a pH screen. Figure 7 shows the fluorescence intensity in the pH range of 3–11.

Figure 7 Fluorescence
spectra of L1 (10 μM) and L2–L4 (1 mM)
at different pH values in 10 mM KH2PO4 buffer.
L1 is excited at 300 nm, L2 is excited at 380 nm, and L3 and L4 are
excited at 375 nm.

L1 showed interesting
results. Upon excitation at 300 nm, a pH
range of 3–4 was shown to be most fluorescent followed by a
continuous decrease in fluorescence at pH 5–7. At pH 8, a blue
shift of the emission spectrum is observed going from an emission
maximum of 440 to 420 nm followed by another blue shift of the emission
maximum to 400 nm at pH 9–13. These changes can be explained
by keto-amine and phenol-imine tautomerization. For L1, pH ranges
3–7 prefer the phenol-imine tautomer, whereas pH ranges 8–13
prefer the keto-amine tautomer (see Figure S8). The pH affects this shift due to the protonation and deprotonation
of the phenolic and imine groups in L1. The pKa of a typical phenol
is 10, but in the presence of a para-electron-withdrawing group (such
as a nitro group), the pKa drops down
to 7.91.50 Additionally, the pKa for a Schiff-base imine is around 6.51 In line with the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation,52 one could expect an effective buffer range at
±1 of the pH equal to the pKa. When
pH is <5, the L1 is expected to be fully protonated and when pH
is >9, L1 is fully deprotonated. Xiang and co-workers reported
a significant
difference in fluorescence activity upon protonation and deprotonation
of the phenol hydrogen of salicyladehdye.55 They reported stronger fluorescence for the
deprotonated phenol salicylaldehyde derivatives than their corresponding
protonated salicylaldehyde derivatives in solution at room temperature.55 Contrary to salicylaldehyde, the diamine linker
of Schiff-base L1 causes the molecule to be more rigid in structure.
Since the deprotonated phenol groups will carry a negative charge
in pH ranges of 7–9, the two charges repel each other and without
the ability to alleviate this interaction via rotation, the ligand
resorts to the formation of the keto-amine tautomer.

A linear
change in fluorescence was observed for L2 with changing
pH, with the highest fluorescence being observed in pH ranges 8–13
followed by a gradual decline in more acidic environments. Similarly,
L3 and L4 showed the highest activity in pH ranges 8–11 again
with a decrease in activity as the ligand becomes more acidic. These
results match the results obtained by Xiang and
co-workers with salicylaldehyde derivatives.55

To examine the ability of these ligands to detect amounts
of metal
ions in biological systems, we investigated the effect of pH on the
ligands in the presence of vital metal ions in the human body to include
Cu2+, Co2+, and Cr3+. A summary of
the results is shown in Figure S9. The
ligand which gave the best result in terms of quenching
efficiency was L3 (Figure 8).

Figure 8 Plot of the integrated fluorescence intensity for the emission
of L3 from 400 to 650 nm in the absence (red bar) and presence (green,
purple and blue bar) of 1 equiv of the metal ion against pH. Excitation
occurred at 380 nm.

Similar to the free ligand,
complexation with metal ions gives
the highest fluorescence intensity in the pH ranges of 8–13.
Although pH ranges 4–7 show decreased fluorescence intensity,
they show a greater quenching efficiency for the metal ions which
is advantageous for detecting trace amounts of metal ions. This ligand
shows good potential for use in biological applications due to its
wide range including physiological pH (pH = 7.4).

Conclusions
In summary, we report the development of four water-soluble Schiff-base
ligands capable of detecting select metal ions in water. The ligands
synthesized have practical use for the detection of metal ions Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, Co2+, and
Pb2+ in water. The selectivity of metal ions Cu2+, Ni2+, Cr3+, and Co2+ is exhibited
via fluorescence quenching accompanied by fluorometric and colorimetric
changes and Ag+ by daylight colorimetric changes. The advantages
of these ligands being water soluble, fluorescent, and stable at physiological
pH make them appealing for biological applications. Efforts to increase
the quantum yield and sensitivity of the alkyl linker Schiff-bases
by additional conjugation in the backbone are currently under investigation.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Instrumentation
All reagents were purchased
from commercial suppliers and used without further purification. Deionized
water was used in all experiments. 1H NMR (500 MHz) spectra
were recorded in DMSO-d6 and chemical
shifts are reported in ppm using tetramethylsilane as the internal
standard. UV/vis absorption spectra were recorded using a Greiner
Bio-One 96-well microplate and a Synergy H4 Spectrofluorometer with
a plate-reading accessory. Instrumental parameters were optimized
for each ligand including adjustments of excitation and emission slit
widths (9–20 nm), filters, and PMT tube voltage (50–150
V).

Quantum Yield Determinations
Φ was measured by
the optical dilute method of Demas and Crosby53 and
the procedure was followed as essentially described54 with a standard of quinine sulfate (Φr = 0.55, quinine in 0.0025 M sulfate) calculated by: Φx = ΦST((Gradx/GradST)(ηx2/ηST2)), where the subscripts ST and x denote the standard and ligand,
respectively, Φ is the fluorescence quantum yield, Grad is the
gradient from the plot of integrated fluorescence intensity vs concentration,
and η is the refractive index of the solvent. The optical path
length is 1 cm in all cases. Errors for Φ values (±10%)
are estimated.

containing 40 mL of methanol. To the reaction mixture, an ethanol
solution of the respective amine (0.5 equiv) was added dropwise and
then the mixture was stirred at 80 °C for 2 h. The reaction was
then filtered and the residue was washed with cold methanol to afford
the desired product.

Synthesis of L1
L1 was prepared
by the general procedure
with o-phenylenediamine (0.241 g, 2.23 mmol) to afford L1 (0.96 g, 83% yield) as orange crystals which matched the
reported literature.561H NMR

(d, 2H), 6.87 (d, 2H).

Synthesis of L2
L2 was
synthesized via
the general procedure with ethylenediamine (0.134 g, 2.23 mmol) to
afford L2 (1.01 g, 96% yield) as yellow crystals which
matched the reported literature.361H NMR (DMSO-d6, 500 MHz, 25 °C):
δ (ppm) 8.62 (s, 2H), 7.65 (s, 2H), 7.50 (d, 2H), 6.77–6.75
(d, 2H), 3.89 (s, 4H).

L3 was
synthesized via
the general procedure with 1,3-diaminopropane (0.165 g, 2.23 mmol)
to afford L3 (0.511 g, 47% yield) as yellow crystals

162.19, 139.26, 130.46, 129.41, 117.47, 116.48, 57.86, 28.45.

General Procedure for Fluorescence Quenching Titrations
Quenching studies were carried out at room temperature using a Synergy
H4 Spectrofluorometer with a plate-reading accessory. Stock solutions
for the ligands and contaminants were made at 0.1 M using DI water.
The solutions were diluted with DI water to obtain concentrations
of 10–150 μM. For each ligand, and for each contaminant,
1200 μL of sample were prepared with 10 different contaminant
equivalents (including blanks) ranging from 0.1 to 4 equiv. Then,
365 μL of sample was transferred to the wells of a 96-well plate
for analysis and read. Spectrofluorometer parameters were adjusted
so that controls containing only the ligand gave nearly maximal emission
spectra, and then full data sets were collected using those parameters.
The assays were performed in triplicate or greater. The mean integrated
areas of the visible emission spectra at 1 equiv of the contaminant
were used to determine unquenched (I0)
and quenched (I) values, and plotted in Excel with
standard deviations indicated by error bars. For determining minimal
detection limits, more dilute ligand solutions were used (typically
10- to 100-fold lower than those used for the rest of the work described
above) that pushed the spectrofluorometer parameters to maximal values,
and ligands were titrated with micromolar concentrations of contaminants.
When quenching could be detected, it was verified at the lowest concentration
in triplicate or quintuplicate.

Procedure for pH Studies
The pH studies were carried
out at room temperature using a Synergy H4 Spectrofluorometer with
a plate-reading accessory. Stock solutions for the ligands and contaminants
were made at 0.1 M. For each ligand, 13 solutions were diluted, respectively,
with a 10 mM KH2PO4 buffer with a pH ranging
from 3 to 13 to obtain concentrations of 10 μM for L1 and 1
mM for L2–L4. For each ligand and pH, 1000 μL of samples
were prepared. Then, 365 μL of sample was transferred to the
wells of a 96-well plate for analysis and read. Spectrofluorometer
parameters were adjusted so that controls containing only the ligand
gave nearly maximal emission spectra, and then full data sets were
collected using those parameters. The assays were performed in duplicate
or greater. The same procedure was followed for the complexation of
Cu2+, Co2+, and Cr3+ with 1 equiv
(with respect to the ligand) of the metal ion added to each solution.
