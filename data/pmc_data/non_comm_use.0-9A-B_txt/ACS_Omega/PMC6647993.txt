While a wide range of experimental
and commercial transfection
reagents are currently available, persistent problems remain regarding
their suitability for continued development. These include the transfection
efficiency for difficult-to-transfect cell types and the risks of
decreased cell viability that may arise from any transfection that
does occur. Therefore, research is now turning toward alternative
molecules that improve the toxicity profile of the gene delivery vector
(GDV), while maintaining the transfection efficiency. Among them,
cell-penetrating peptides, such as octa-arginine, have shown significant
potential as GDVs. Their pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties
can be enhanced through peptidomimetic conversion, whereby a peptide
is modified into a synthetic analogue that mimics its structure and/or
function, but whose backbone is not solely based on α-amino
acids. Using this technology, novel peptidomimetics were developed
by co- and postpolymerization functionalization of substituted ethylene
oxides, producing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based peptidomimetics
termed “PEGtides”. Specifically, a PEGtide of the poly(α-amino
acid) oligo-arginine [poly(glycidylguanidine)] was assessed for its
ability to complex and deliver a small interfering ribonucleic acid
(siRNA) using a range of cell assays and high-content analysis. PEGtide–siRNA
demonstrated significantly increased internalization and gene inhibition
over 24 h in Calu-3 pulmonary epithelial cells compared to commercial
controls and octa-arginine-treated samples, with no evidence of toxicity.
Furthermore, PEGtide–siRNA nanocomplexes can provide significant
levels of gene inhibition in “difficult-to-transfect”
mouse embryonic hypothalamic (mHypo N41) cells. Overall, the usefulness
of this novel PEGtide for gene delivery was clearly demonstrated,
establishing it as a promising candidate for continued translational
research.

==== Body
Introduction
Since
its discovery, short interfering RNA (siRNA) has been under
near-constant development as a potential therapy for a wide range
of conditions.1,2 Initially, research was focused
on the more obvious targets of diseases with an underlying genetic
cause such as cystic fibrosis3,4 but has now expanded
to more varied targets such as dry eye disease, hepatitis B, and solid
tumors.1 Following initial setbacks in
the clinical translation of siRNA therapeutics, the technology is
now experiencing a resurgence with the first Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)-approved therapy, patisiran (Onpattro) by Alnylam, emerging
for hereditary amyloidogenic transthyretin amyloidosis and several
more now entering large-scale clinical trials.1,5 However,
a major issue remaining in developing siRNA therapeutic targets is
the lack of suitable gene delivery vectors (GDVs) for most target
organs. Poor cell uptake, toxicity, and immune cell activation are
common issues reported among many synthetic vectors that otherwise
display a promising level of gene inhibition.2

To avoid some issues observed concerning the administration
of
compounds that the body views as foreign, cell-penetrating peptides
(CPPs) have been investigated as siRNA GDVs for a range of cell types/organs.6 The oligo-arginine peptides, specifically octa-arginine
(R8) and nona-arginine (R9) peptides, were identified as early candidates
for the delivery of siRNA. From their preliminary studies, it was
found that oligo-arginine–siRNA nanoparticles were capable
of inducing gene knockdown to levels similar to or better than those
observed with the reference CPP TAT.7

However, despite significant achievements in the field of peptide
therapeutics, peptide-based candidates may have some shortcomings
in clinical development.8 To address some
of these issues, efforts have led to the development of a class of
molecules with peptide-like functions, known as “peptidomimetics”.
A peptidomimetic is a generic term describing a molecule that displays
the biological activity of a parent peptide while being structurally
different.9−11 It can mimic a peptide primary structure through
the use of amide bond isosteres and/or alteration of the native peptide
backbone, including retro-inverso modification, chain extension, cyclization,
or heteroatom incorporation.11−13 This has been successfully applied
to a range of clinical applications, including the development and
optimization of antimicrobial peptides and cell-binding motifs.10,14,15 Recently, work has also been
undertaken to utilize the potential of the peptidomimetic technology
in the delivery of biological macromolecules to generate targeted
gene delivery vectors16 or to improve the
uptake ability and metabolic stability of preexisting CPPs.17

In addition to the peptidomimetic conversion,
the modification
of peptides and proteins with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) chains,
termed pegylation, is another archetypal technique of structural adaptation
for polyamide-based therapeutics.21 However,
the combination of these two approaches has not been attempted to
date. Therefore, the synthesis of a novel PEG-based oligo-arginine
peptidomimetic and evaluation of its capacity to complex and deliver
siRNA are reported therein. This peptidomimetic would combine the
previously described ability of polyarginines to effectively deliver
siRNA with the improved safety profiles that have long been associated
with PEGylation.18,19 Specifically, PEG chains functionalized
with groups resembling amino acid side chains and separated by an
equal number of bonds compared to that in a peptide (Figure 1) were formed by a co- and
postpolymerization functionalization approach. These hybrid structures
of PEG and peptides, termed “PEGtides”, are therefore
different from the PEGtide dendrons that alternate monodisperse nonfunctionalized
PEG chains and dipeptide Lys-β-Ala motifs.20

Figure 1 General structures of peptides and side-chain-functionalized poly(ethylene
glycol)s as PEG-based peptidomimetics (Rn: variable side chain; In: initiator).

Accordingly, a substituted oxirane was polymerized to form
a functionalized
PEG, which was modified to produce the oligo-arginine mimetic poly(glycidylguanidine)
(PGG, 4; Scheme 1). This CPP PEGtide, named thereafter PEGtide, was then tested
for its ability to form nanocomplexes with siRNA, as well as to promote
uptake and gene inhibition versus commercial controls. Its safety
profile was also established. This allowed for the rapid evaluation
of this novel molecule’s future potential as a successful siRNA
delivery vector.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to Poly(glycidylguanidine) (4), Starting
from (±)-tert-Butyl N-(2-Oxiranylmethyl)carbamate
Results
PEGtide Synthesis
The poly(glycidylguanidine) (4) was produced in four
synthetic steps in 16% overall yield
(Scheme 1). Reactions
were monitored by 1H NMR and shown to be quantitative.
The purification of the last intermediate was performed by size exclusion
chromatography (SEC), and the final product (PEGtide) was analyzed
by 1H NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS).

The PEG backbone
of this peptidomimetic was produced by anionic ring-opening polymerization
of tert-butyl N-(2-oxiranylmethyl)carbamate,
using potassium hydroxide as the initiator. Polymerization in the
bulk monomer at 150 °C resulted in its complete conversion as
well as the formation of tert-butylated amine repeating
units by thermal decomposition of the t-Butyloxycarbonyl
(Boc) group.21 The latter was then removed
from the polymer by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid. The deprotected
primary amines were, in turn, reacted with N,N′-di-Boc-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine,
resulting in the guanylation of most repeating units. After SEC purification
of this ultimate intermediate, the final deprotection of the guanidine
groups was performed by treatment with trifluoroacetic acid, yielding
poly(glycidylguanidine) (PGG). MALDI-TOF MS analysis was performed
to characterize this product. The spectrum displayed main and fragmentation
peak series, separated by 16 mass units, characteristic of PEG,22,23 with molecular weight distributions based on a glycidylguanidine
repeating unit. It also showed the presence of tert-butylated amine and free amine repeating units and a degree of polymerization
for PGG ranging from 3 to 13 (Figure 2).

Figure 2 MALDI-TOF MS spectrum of poly(glycidylguanidine). The
molecular
weight distributions of 677, 793, 908, 1023, 1138, 1253, 1368, 1483,
and 1598 are from the main series, and the molecular weight distributions
of 661, 776, 892, 1007, 1122, 1237, 1352, 1467, 1582, and 1697 are
from the fragmentation peak series. A version of this spectrum labeled
with exact masses is available in the Supporting Information.

Accordingly, most PEGtide
chains formed by this approach display
the minimum net cationic charge required for the biological activity
of the parent peptide. The polymerization of 1 g of monomer yielded
136 mg of PEGtide. The fractionation of this polymer into smaller
ranges of repeating units was attempted by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) (ion exchange chromatography, reversed phase
(RP), SEC) but remained impracticable, so the polydisperse PEGtide
(4) was tested for the transmembrane delivery of siRNA.

Size and ζ Potential of PEGtide–siRNA Nanoparticles
Following complex formation by electrostatic interaction, the physicochemical
characteristics of the PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles were assessed
over a range of N/P ratios (Figure 3). It was found that large nanoparticles of size approximately
540–580 nm were observed at lower N/P ratios. The PEGtide–siRNA
nanoparticle size decreased to 298 nm at the highest value of N/P
= 30. Similarly, the polydispersity indices (PDIs) also demonstrated
increasing homogeneity, with increasing N/P ratios, with N/P = 15
and 30 both giving the lowest PDIs of 0.2. The analysis of the surface
charge revealed that PEGtide–siRNA complexes formed increasingly
cationic nanoparticles with increasing N/P ratios. However, most of
the nanoparticles retained an overall anionic charge with fully cationic
particles only forming at N/P = 30.

Multiparameter Analysis
of PEGtide–siRNA Nanoparticle
Toxicity in Calu-3 Cells
High-throughput multiparameter methods
were harnessed to rapidly screen for the toxicity of PEGtide–siRNA
nanoparticles in Calu-3 cells. The nanoparticles were assessed using
Calu-3 cells that were incubated with 100 nM siRNA per well over a
range of peptidomimetic/siRNA ratios for 24 h. Thereafter, cell viability
and nanoparticle-mediated toxicity were qualitatively and quantitatively
determined using the Cellomics Multiparameter Cytotoxicity 3 kit and
InCell 1000 Workstation software for analysis.

The analysis
of the data revealed that PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles remained
well tolerated at all doses subsequently shown to facilitate siRNA
uptake, with significant decreases in the cell number only observed
at the higher N/P ratios of N/P = 60 and 100 (Figure 4A). However, these were only examined to
illustrate a dose response at very high doses.

intensity in arbitrary units (a.u.) (one-way analysis of variance
vs untreated cells, n = 3 ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001).

The analysis of the cell
death-associated characteristics was also
carried out. The examination of the changes observed in the mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP) following nanoparticle administration yielded
conflicting results (Figure 4B). Some small MMP decreases in PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticle-treated
cells were observed at N/P = 12 and 60; however, there appeared to
be no correlation with the dose, thereby resulting in no definite
conclusions being drawn from this parameter. The analysis of cytochrome c release from PEGtide–siRNA-treated cells demonstrated
no significant changes, regardless of the N/P ratios applied, while
a significant increase observed with the positive control valinomycin
confirmed that the assay functioned as expected (Figure 4C). The examination of the
changes elicited in the plasma membrane permeability (PMP) levels,
however, resulted in much clearer indications of cytotoxicity at higher
doses (Figure 4D).
Overall, the use of PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles was well tolerated
and resulted in no significant changes in PMP except at the higher
N/P ratios of 60 and 100.

Analysis of PEGtide–siRNA Nanoparticle
Uptake in Calu-3
Cells
The ability of the PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles
to facilitate siRNA uptake by Calu-3 cells was assessed using high-content
analysis (HCA) and was compared to a benchmark, lipid-based, transfection
reagent (RNAiFect). Calu-3 cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC)-tagged siRNA–PEGtide nanoparticles using mimetic/siRNA
ratios ranging from 6 to 30. Thereafter, the cells were incubated
for 2, 4, or 24 h prior to HCA quantification (Figure 5). At 2 h post-treatment, there was no significant
difference in nanoparticle uptake between PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles
and RNAiFect–siRNA nanoparticles. However, when the incubation
time was increased to 4 h, there were significantly higher levels
of nanoparticle uptake in the PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles at
N/P = 15 and 30. The levels of PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticle uptake
continued to increase at 24 h post-treatment and led to significantly
higher levels of siRNA internalization than in RNAiFect–siRNA-treated
cells, at all N/P ratios, except 30, where no significant difference
between the two nanoparticles was observed.

0.001).

PEGtide–siRNA Nanoparticle
Knockdown
To examine
the ability of PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles to effect gene knockdown,
luciferase-expressing Calu-3 cells were transfected with 100 nM antiluciferase
siRNA for 24 h using optimal conditions (Figure S8), and the results were analyzed (Figure 6A). At lower N/P ratios, there was no significant
difference between the peptidomimetic nanoparticles and RNAiFect-treated
samples. However, at N/P = 15 and 30, the knockdown efficiency of
peptidomimetic nanoparticles was significantly higher than commercial
controls with levels of knockdown as high as 68.56 ± 12.85%.
In contrast to its peptidomimetic, it was found that octa-arginine
transfection did not demonstrate significant improvement in gene knockdown
compared to RNAiFect. Indeed, PEGtide–siRNA-mediated luciferase
knockdown was significantly higher than octa-arginine-transfected
samples at N/P = 30.

(two-way ANOVA, n = 3 ± SEM, †p < 0.05 ††p < 0.01, † vs RNAiFect, * vs octa-arginine).
(B) Percentage of luciferase knockdown in difficult-to-transfect N41
neuronal cells demonstrated significant levels of knockdown that were
comparable to those in commercial controls (one-way ANOVA, n = 3 ± SEM, * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01, significance vs nontargeting controls).

Finally, PEGtide–siRNA
particles were also examined in the
N41 neuronal cell line to demonstrate the efficacy in a known cell
type that is commonly seen as difficult to transfect (Figure 6B). Using this cell line, it
was observed that PEGtide–siRNA was capable of significant
levels of gene inhibition at N/P = 15 and 30 against negative controls.
Furthermore, the levels of gene knockdown were also comparable to
those of the Lipofectamine positive controls.

Discussion
No standard method has been reported to convert a peptide into
a peptidomimetic. The structural modification can be from conservative
to extreme, but peptidomimetic transformations tend to focus on the
linear (polyamide) backbone of the peptide. The latter is the target
of degradative enzymes; consequently, peptidomimetic conversions generally
aim to replace the polyamide chain by an analogous non-natural backbone.
Many peptidomimetic structures and approaches have been developed.24 However, these methods generally use synthetic
approaches reminiscent of peptide synthesis, following a stepwise
approach, where each amino acid derivative or analogue is sequentially
added to a growing chain. Therefore, we have chosen an alternative
strategy, based on a recently introduced polymerization technique,
which generates a linear backbone analogous to the peptide’s
polyamide chain. However, polymer-based peptidomimetics of the oligo-arginine
CPP were successfully developed such as guanidinylated poly((oxa)norbornenes),
polymethacrylamides, and oligo- and polycarbonates, as well as guanidinylated
polymethacrylates,25−27 and this technique has not yet been applied to PEG.
Considering that it was described as “the gold standard biocompatible
polymer for pharmaceutical and medical applications”,11 PEG represents a highly attractive moiety to
replace the polyamide backbone of a peptide. The polymerization of
functionalized ethylene oxides and their subsequent modification can
yield PEG-based peptidomimetics of sequence-independent peptides.
We applied this peptidomimetic conversion here to a homopoly(α-amino
acid) representative of a class of peptidic delivery agents to create
a hybrid structure of PEG and a peptide that we have termed a “PEGtide”.
Consistent with the polymerization technique used, the material obtained
is a polydisperse polymer. However, anionic ring-opening polymerization,
such as the one used here, is likely to provide better control over
the molecular weight distribution than cationic ring-opening polymerization.14 It is noteworthy that the PEG-based peptidomimetic
PEGtide was produced from a racemic substituted oxirane and is therefore
optically inactive. This could impact the ability of the PEGtide to
complex a homochiral cargo such as a siRNA. However, homochiral polymers
themselves would be associated with higher production costs. It should
also be considered that the biological activities of CPPs can be independent
of the stereochemistry of their constitutive amino acids,28 although heterochiral CPPs and racemic mixtures
of these peptides are generally not used. Whether the use of monodisperse
and/or homochiral PEGtides provide even higher transfection efficiencies
will be investigated in the future. While it will most likely be necessary
to further refine either the synthesis or purification for progression
toward clinical applications, the use of polydisperse transfection
reagents is more acceptable in an in vitro setting. Examples of these
are widely used in the fields of gene delivery and biomaterials (e.g.,
polyethylenimine and chitosan).29,30

When the PEGtide
was complexed to siRNA, it was found to form complexes
in the nanorange with an increasing cationic surface charge corresponding
to an increasing N/P ratio, with a fully cationic surface charge not
observed until N/P > 15. This is most likely because the full condensation
of the siRNA is only achieved at this point. This is consistent with
the previously described relationship between siRNA condensation and
increasing N/P ratio.31,32

Overall, size distribution
was similar to current CPP-based transfection
platforms (e.g., the PepFect system)33,34 and other
peptidomimetic constructs.35 Considering
the large size of these particles relative to other nanoparticles,
it is most likely a result of the use of phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS) as a dispersant in complexation. This is indeed known to exert
a significant influence on the size and surface charge of siRNA nanocomplexes.36,37 Furthermore, the lower charge density and PEG backbone of the PEGtide
itself are also known to exert an effect on nanoparticle size and
charge. Recent studies involving a range of PEGylated polymers have
highlighted the effect that PEG molecular weights and grafting densities
can have on particle size and ζ potential.38 Specifically, Moore et al. also demonstrated that varying
the level of cationic grafting to a PEG backbone can result in nucleic
acid nanoparticle sizes ranging from 200 to 500 nm.39 Furthermore, decreases in ζ potentials following
PEGylation of CPPs have also been reported.40 Finally, there are numerous reports indicating that incubation in
serum will have dramatic effects on particle size and charge. Specifically,
work by Kummitha et al.41 and Strojan et
al.42 using a range of particle types found
that size and polydispersity dramatically increase following exposure
to serum. However, considering the high levels of gene inhibition
observed in this study, serum-PEGtide interactions did not pose an
insurmountable obstacle to cell endocytosis.

Using a multiparameter
HCA approach, PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles
were found to be well tolerated with no indications of toxicity up
to N/P = 60 and 100 using 100 nM of siRNA. At these N/P ratios, the
cell numbers were significantly reduced, and PMP was found to be significantly
enhanced as was previously reported at cytotoxic levels using this
approach.36 While the cell numbers were
found to be dose-dependent in a clear fashion, the additional cytotoxic
parameters provided additional details on the nature of the cytotoxic
mechanism in action. This was most evident in the staining for cytochrome c release. While treatment with both valinomycin and MG132
resulted in significant decreases in the cell number, only treatment
with valinomycin resulted in significant release of cytochrome c. Although both positive controls are known to induce apoptosis
via cytochrome c release and subsequent caspase cascade,43 it is also possible that the more potent MG132
is also inducing cell death via caspase-independent cell death such
as autophagy. This mode of cell death has been found to occur independently
of caspase release,44 although there is
a large amount of cross-talk between the two mechanisms. The safety
profile of these PEGtides was further clarified compared to previously
established toxicities of commercial gene delivery vectors. Specifically,
studies by Breunig et al. demonstrated that following lipofectamine
use, at comparable nucleic acid concentrations to those used in this
study, decreases in cell viability of 12–47% were observed.45 Furthermore, toxicity profiles determined by
the PEGtide approach described here represent an improvement on previous
efforts by the authors with octa-argine grafting, which demonstrated
decreases in viability of 15–40%.46

To analyze a large array of time points and doses, HCA methods
were employed, similar to those previously described in industrial
and research applications.36 When assessed
for uptake into Calu-3 cells, PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles did
not demonstrate any significant difference from RNAiFect until 4 h
post-treatment. This lower rate of uptake for anionic particles would
also be in keeping with the difficulties expected from anionic or
weakly cationic particles interacting with the negatively charged
cell membrane. The polydispersity of some of the lower N/P ratios
results in some uncertainty regarding their behavior; most likely,
there is a subpopulation of smaller particles that possess a size
and charge amenable to endocytosis. While the ζ potential for
these N/P ratios is negative, studies have found that negatively charged
particles can internalize via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.47

Specifically, at 4 h post-treatment, the
only PEGtide–siRNA
nanoparticles that had significantly higher levels of siRNA uptake
compared to RNAiFect–siRNA nanoparticles were the most compact
and cationic ones (N/Ps = 15 and 30). However, when tested at 24 h
post-treatment and N/P ratios ranging from 6 to 15, the levels of
siRNA uptake were significantly higher with PEGtide than with RNAiFect.
Considering the PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticle size and surface
charge, it is likely that they are transient aggregations based on
their microenvironment but that dispersion and subsequent transfection
ultimately occur (albeit at a much reduced rate). This was found to
be the case using other nanoparticle systems and has even been used
as a strategy for targeting the lungs.48,49

Interestingly,
a decrease in uptake levels was also observed from
4 to 24 h in PEGtide–siRNA samples at N/P = 30. Since these
nanoparticles were observed to be internalized at the highest rate,
this drop was likely a result of faster overall cycling through the
cell trafficking machinery. The result is either exocytosis via egress
of the PEGtide–siRNA from late endosomes/lysosomes (≅70%
of the internalized siRNA)50 or final degradation
in the lysosome. This was previously found to be the case for 99%
of delivered particles that are not ejected51 and would explain the apparent drop in the number of internalized
PEGtide–siRNA particles.

The PEGtide delivery of siRNA
to Calu-3 cells resulted in the efficient
knockdown of ∼70% at N/P = 30. These levels of knockdown were
significantly higher than both RNAiFect commercial controls and luciferase
knockdown obtained using the same N/P ratio of traditional octa-arginine.
When comparing against the earlier uptake experiments, we note that
while uptake was faster overall at N/P = 30, there was no significant
difference between N/P = 15 and 30. This is reflected in the gene
knockdown data described and we contend that this is most likely a
result of all available RNA-induced silencing complex machinery becoming
saturated or approaching a point of saturation at the 24 h mark.

Furthermore, PEGtide delivery of siRNA provided significant levels
of gene knockdown in the “hard-to-transfect” N41 neuronal
cell line at a level approaching those achieved with commercially
available Lipofectamine 2000 (Lf2000). It is also worth considering
that the PEGtide–siRNA system described here is relatively
low in molecular weight, simple in structure, and can be formed in
a four-step reaction procedure from relatively inexpensive reagents.
This should allow for successful future scale-up and testing in more
complex in vitro and in vivo models.

Conclusions
With
siRNA now achieving FDA approval for certain indications,
it remains imperative that there are appropriate carriers for safe
and efficient delivery for a range of diseases and organs. The PEGtide
system described in this paper has demonstrated a strong capability
for nanoparticle formation combined with a low-toxicity profile and
high levels of gene inhibition. It also represents a flexible system
amenable to applications that may encompass those that have been successfully
implemented with CPPs, including the delivery of proteins, liposomes,
nanoparticles, and larger nucleic acids, such as those used by the
CRISPR/Cas-9 gene editing technology.

General Experimental Methods
NMR
spectra were recorded
using a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer. MALDI-TOF MS analysis was
performed either on an AB Sciex 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF (Cheshire, U.K.),
using α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid as a matrix, or a Waters

Synthetic Procedures and Analytical Data
Octa-d-Arginine Synthesis
This peptide was assembled
by standard solid-phase peptide synthesis52 according to the Fmoc-tBu strategy53 with HATU/N,N-diisopropylethylamine
(DIEA) coupling chemistry in NMP solvent.
Single-coupling cycles, using a total 10-fold excess of Fmoc-d-Arg(Pbf)-OH to resin-bound peptide, were used. Assembly of the amino
acid sequence, starting from a Rink Amide MBHA resin, was carried
out on a 100 μmol scale using a 433 Applied Biosystems automated
peptide synthesizer (Warrington, U.K.). The peptide was deprotected
and released from the resin by treatment with a cleavage cocktail
consisting of 95% trifluoroacetic acid, 2.5% water, and 2.5% triisopropylsilane
for 4.5 h. The peptide was then precipitated from this solution with
diethyl ether, isolated by centrifugation, and washed three times
with diethyl ether. It was next air-dried, dissolved in distilled
water, and lyophilized.

Chromatographic analysis and purification
were performed by RP-HPLC using the Varian Galaxy HPLC (Walnut Creek,
CA) and PerSeptive BioSystems BioCad Sprint Perfusion Chromatography
HPLC (Warrington, U.K.), respectively, and Phenomenex Jupiter 5 μm
C5 300 Å columns, 4.6 mm D × 250 mm L analytical; 10 mm D × 250 mm L semipreparative (Macclesfield, U.K.). The mobile phase
consisted of buffer A: 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water and
buffer B: 0.1% TFA in acetonitrile, with a linear gradient of 5–65%
B in 30 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min (analysis) or 4 mL/min (semipreparative).
UV single-wavelength detection was performed at 214 nm for the BioCad
Sprint, while the Varian Galaxy was equipped with a photodiode array
(PDA) detector operating from 190 to 950 nm. Purity was ascertained
from the percent area of octa-arginine relative to the total area
of all UV-absorbing components.

Analytical HPLC (C5): tR = 11.53 min,
89% purity.

MALDI-TOF MS (m/z) (α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic
acid) calcd for C48H100N33O8: 1266.843. Found: 1266.839.

Poly(glycidylguanidine)
(PGG) Synthesis
Poly(glycidyl tert-butylcarbamate)
(1)
Polymerization was performed in the bulk
monomer: tert-butyl N-(2-oxiranylmethyl)carbamate
(1.02 g, 5.9 mmol) was introduced in a round-bottom flask maintained
at 50 °C. Potassium hydroxide (16.5 mg, 0.29 mmol) was added
under nitrogen, and the solution was stirred at 150 °C for 45
min. When the polymer had begun to solidify, the polymerization was
quenched by adding methanol (2 mL), which was then removed under vacuum,
providing poly(glycidyl tert-butylcarbamate) in quantitative
yield.

1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ
= 3.84–2.98 (m, CH2O, CH2N and CH, 6H),
1.37 (s, CH3 Boc, 9H), 1.20 (s, CH3t-Bu, 3H).

The signal at 1.20 ppm is attributed to tert-butylated
amine repeating units (vide infra). Complete conversion of the monomer
is shown by the absence of signals at 2.59 and 2.40 ppm (CH2O).

Poly(glycidylamine) (2)
Boc deprotection
was carried out by dissolving poly(glycidyl tert-butylcarbamate)
(1.02 g, 5.9 mmol) in a mixture of dichloromethane (3 mL) and trifluoroacetic
acid (3 mL). This solution was stirred in an open flask at 0 °C
for 30 min, followed by 2 h at room temperature (RT). The solvent
was then removed by evaporation using a stream of nitrogen. The residue
was dissolved in water, and the solution was freeze-dried. Poly(glycidylamine)
was recovered as a yellow oil in quantitative yield.

1H NMR (400 MHz, D2O) δ = 3.86–2.93 (m, CH,
CH2O and CH2N, 339 H), 1.08 (s, CH3t-Bu, 9H).

The signal at 1.08 ppm is attributed
to tert-butylated
amine repeating units. Successful deprotection was shown by the reduction
near to the baseline of the signal at 1.40 ppm (CH3 Boc).

Poly(glycidyl N,N′-di-Boc-guanidine)
(3)
To a solution of poly(glycidylamine) (500
mg, 6.85 mmol) in dimethylformamide (10 mL), N,N′-di-Boc-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine
(4.2 g, 13.7 mmol) and DIEA (4.76 mL, 27.4 mmol) were added. The resulting
yellow solution was stirred at room temperature for 48 h. Water (50
mL) was then added, and the solution was extracted with chloroform.
The organic phase was subjected to size column chromatography (Sephadex
LH 20 as the stationary phase and methanol as the mobile phase); 400
mg (18%) of product was recovered.

1H NMR (400 MHz,
CDCl3) δ = 11.40 (bs, NH, 1H), 8.56 (bs, NH, 1H),
3.93–3.17 (m, CH, CH2O and CH2N, 8H),
1.40 (s, CH3, 18H).

Poly(glycidylguanidine)
(PGG, 4)
Boc deprotection
was carried out by dissolving polyglycidyl N,N′-di-Boc-guanidine
(400 mg, 1.23 mmol) in a mixture of dichloromethane (3 mL) and trifluoroacetic
acid (3 mL). This solution was stirred in an open flask at 0 °C
for 30 min, followed by 2 h at room temperature. The solvent was then
removed by evaporation using a stream of nitrogen. The residue was
dissolved in water, and the solution was freeze-dried. Poly(glycidylguanidine)
was recovered as a yellow oil (136 mg, 95%).

1H NMR
(400 MHz, D2O) δ = 3.90–2.96 (m, CH, CH2O and CH2N, 294H), 1.09 (s, tBu,
9H).

The signal at 1.09 ppm is attributed to tert-butylated
amine repeating units. Successful deprotection was shown by the disappearance
of the signal at 1.40 ppm (CH3 Boc).

Nanoparticle Formation
and Physicochemical Data
For
octa-arginine and PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticle formation, a weighed
amount of polymer was diluted in PBS to the required concentration
of 1 mg/mL. Amine (N)-to-siRNA phosphate (P) N/P ratios were calculated
as previously described54 for octa-arginine
nanoparticles with equivalent masses of cationic polymer used to make
PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles. Various volumes of the cationic
polymer solutions were then added to the appropriate amount of 20
μM siRNA to give specific N/P ratios and were diluted in PBS
to a final concentration of 1 μM. The polymer–siRNA solutions
were then mixed gently with a pipette to ensure homogeneity and were
incubated at room temperature for 20–30 min to allow nanoparticle
formation.

The size distribution (mean diameter and polydispersity
index) and ζ potential of the siRNA nanoparticle dispersions
were measured by dynamic light scattering and laser Doppler electrophoresis,
respectively, using a Nano-ZS system (Nano series; Malvern Instruments).
This measured the mass distribution of the particle size and the electrophoretic
mobility of the dispersed particles. Measurements were made at 25
°C with a fixed angle of 137°. The sizes quoted are the z-average means (dz) for the nanoparticle
hydrodynamic diameter (nm). Calculation of the ζ potential (mV)
was performed using the same instrument (from electrophoretic mobility).
Following complexation in PBS, the samples were diluted 1 in 50 with
deionized water prior to both procedures. This resulted in a final
ionic concentration of 2.74 mM NaCl, 0.054 mM KCl, 0.2 mM Na2HPO4, and 0.04 mM KH2PO4. Both the
size and ζ potential were measured five times with an average
of 15–20 subscans taken in each measurement.

Multiparameter
Cytotoxicity Study of Peptidomimetic siRNA Nanoparticles
in Calu-3 Cells
Twenty-four hours prior to transfection,
the cells were seeded at 3 × 104/well in a 96-well
plate and were treated with 100 nM siRNA for 24 h. The selected wells
were treated with 120 μM valinomycin or 40 μM carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal
(MG132) for 24 h as a positive control prior to analysis. Following
incubation, the cells were stained and fixed using the Cellomics Multiparameter
Cytotoxicity 3 kit (Thermo Scientific, Dublin, Ireland) according
to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, the cells were live-stained
for mitochondrial membrane potential and plasma membrane permeability.
The cells were then fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde before staining
with Hoechst nuclear stain and fluorescent antibody labeling for cytochrome c. Image acquisition was determined using the InCell 1000
High Content Analyzer (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, U.K.). Four
random fields were viewed per well, and the various N/P ratios were
repeated in quadruplicate. The fluorescence intensity of the dyes
was monitored at the excitation and emission wavelengths specific
to each dye (i.e., 360 and 460 nm for Hoechst, 480 and 535 nm for
the permeability dye, 535 and 600 nm for the mitochondrial membrane
potential dye, and 646/674 nm for DyLight 649 conjugates).

The
exposure times and hardware autofocus (HWAF) values were varied between
experiments to optimize the image quality. Following acquisition of
the images, the data were analyzed using InCell 1000 Workstation software
and multitarget analysis with a variety of settings for each of the
parameters (Table S2). All samples were
run in quadruplicate, and the experiment was repeated on three independent
occasions. The commercial transfection reagents for in vitro-only
use were not assessed for cytotoxicity. However, the various cytotoxic
profiles for these vectors were previously reported in several studies.55−57

siRNA Nanoparticle Uptake in Calu-3 Cells
Calu-3 cells
were seeded at 3 × 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate
(Nunc) 24 h before experiments. Nanoparticles were formed using electrostatic
complexation in a final volume of 125 μL/well in serum-free
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) using 100
nM fluorescently tagged FITC–siRNA. Nanoparticles, or free
siRNA controls, were then incubated with the cells at 37 °C and
5% CO2 for 2, 4 and 24 h. The cells were washed with PBS
and fixed using 4% paraformaldehyde. The cells were then stained for
f-actin using phalloidin–TRITC and Hoechst nuclear stain. Image
analysis was achieved using the InCell 1000 High Content Analyzer.
Four random fields were viewed per well, and the various treatments
were repeated in quadruplicate. The fluorescence intensity of the
dyes was monitored at the excitation and emission wavelengths specific
to each dye—i.e., 360 and 460 nm for Hoechst, 480 and 535 nm
for FITC–siRNA, and 535 and 600 nm for phalloidin–TRITC.
The exposure times and hardware autofocus (HWAF) values were varied
to optimize the image quality. After acquisition of the images, the
data were analyzed using InCell 1000 Workstation software and multitarget
analysis with various settings for each of the parameters (Table S1). Specifically, minimum PEGtide–siRNA
nanocomplex diameters were measured using the “organelle”
function Workstation software and gated to include only FITC-positive
particles of a designated size that were inside cells. These were
proofed against negative controls to eliminate background/artifact
detection and total particles within cells were counted and averaged.
All samples were run in quadruplicate, and the experiment was repeated
on three independent occasions.

siRNA Nanoparticle-Mediated
Luciferase Knockdown in Calu-3 Cells
Calu-3 cells were seeded
at a density of 5 × 104 in 48-well plates 24 h prior
to transfection. Thereafter, the cells
were first transfected with the luciferase control vector plasmid
(Promega, U.K.) and SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen, Manchester,
U.K.) at a dose of 0.75 μg of pDNA/3 μL of SuperFect in
100 μL of serum-free DMEM per well for 4 h. The cells were then
washed three times with warm PBS and transfected with antiluciferase
PEGtide–siRNA nanoparticles consisting of either antiluciferase
siRNA or negative control siRNA at 100 nM/well in 250 μL of
serum-containing media, followed by incubation for 24 h at 37 °C
and 5% CO2.

Control transfections involving siRNA
were carried out using the cationic, lipid-based RNAiFect transfection
vector (Qiagen, Manchester, U.K.). siRNA (1 μg) was diluted
to 100 μL in the supplied Buffer EC-R and vortexed. The appropriate
amount of RNAiFect reagent was then added, and the solution was vortexed
again for 10 s. The samples were incubated at room temperature for
20 min to allow complex formation. Thereafter, the particles were
diluted with serum-containing medium to a final siRNA concentration
of 100 nM before adding 250 μL of the diluted solution to the
cells.

Luciferase expression was assessed using the luciferase
assay system
(Promega) and was read using a Wallac 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer).
The protein expression in each sample was examined using the Micro
bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit (Pierce) according to the
product instructions. All samples were run in quadruplicate, and the
experiment was repeated on three independent occasions.

siRNA Nanoparticle-Mediated
Luciferase Knockdown in mHypo N41
Cells
The mouse embryonic hypothalamic cell line mHypoE N41 was obtained from tebu-bio (Le Perray-en-Yvelines,
France) and was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified
37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The cells were seeded
in 24-well plates at a density of 3.5 × 104 cells/well.

Silencing of an exogenous gene was assessed by measuring the knockdown
of the firefly luciferase gene. Cells were seeded in 24-well plates
for 1 day before transfection with the luciferase reporter plasmid
pGL3 luciferase (1 μg/well) complexed to Lipofectamine 2000
(Invitrogen, Dublin, Ireland) (2.5 μL/μg pDNA) for 4 h.
Thereafter, the cells were washed twice with PBS prior to siRNA transfection.
siRNA was complexed with PEGtide at varying N/P ratios (N/P = 6, 9,
12, 15, and 30) and was incubated for 20–30 min, followed by
dilution in serum-free media without antibiotics. A final volume of
media on cells was 0.5 mL containing 100 nM siRNA per well. Nonsilencing
siRNA complexed to PEGtide at N/P = 30 was used as a nontargeted control.
After 24 h, the cells were lysed with 1× lysis buffer (Promega,
Southampton, U.K.). Next, the lysates (20 μL) were assayed for
the expression of luciferase by adding 100 μL of luciferin (Promega)
and measuring the luminescence in a Junior LB 9059 luminometer (Promega).
The total protein levels in each sample were determined using the
BCA protein assay (Thermo Scientific, Dublin, Ireland) to allow normalization
of luciferase activity. The results were expressed as the percent
of gene expression relative to control samples. The data are presented
as mean ± SEM.

Control transfections involving siRNA were
carried out using the
cationic lipid-based transfection reagent Lipofectamine 2000 (Lf2000).
Lf2000·siRNA complexes were prepared according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Briefly, the required volume of Lf2000 was diluted in 50
μL of OptiMEM, mixed gently, and incubated at RT for 5 min.
siRNA was diluted in 50 μL of OptiMEM and was combined with
the diluted Lf2000, followed by gentle mixing and incubation at RT
for 20 min. One microliter of Lf2000 was used per 20 pmol of siRNA.

Statistical Analysis
The results are expressed as the
mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM) using GraphPad Prism
5 software. Two- and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) were performed
for differences between treatments with p-values
<0.05 considered significant, <0.01 very significant, and <0.001
highly significant.
