Phase change materials (PCMs), such
as Ge2Sb2Te5, are highly attractive
in modern electronics and photonics.
However, their spintronic applications remain largely unexplored.
Here, we propose a tentative modality of phase change spintronic devices
based on the ferromagnet/PCM/ferromagnet structure. The electrically
tunable properties of a PCM interlayer give rise to new possibilities
of manipulating spin transport through phase change, adding new functionalities
and modes of operation to the spintronic devices. As the first step
toward realizing such phase change spintronic devices, we calculate
the electronic structures of the interfaces of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 and half-metallic ferromagnetic Co2FeX (X: Al, Si). The interfaces are found not to be genuine half-metallic,
indicating room for improvement. The band alignments are largely determined
by the termination of c-Ge2Sb2Te5. Two types of band alignments are found for c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeX interfaces. Considering c-Ge2Sb2Te5 as heavily p-type-doped, interfaces
with Te termination are generally suitable such that they offer low
contact resistance for hole injection from Co2FeX to c-Ge2Sb2Te5 in the majority spin channel;
at the same time, they naturally form tunneling barriers, alleviating
the degradation of spin injection efficiency because of occasional
hole injection in the minority spin channel. This work provides important
insights into this proposed phase change spintronic framework.

1 Introduction
Chalcogenide-based
phase change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5 have revolutionized the frontier
of data storage industries.1 The initial
applications of PCMs in the rewritable optical disk exploit the reversible
change of their optical properties.2 In
the past decade, extensive studies on the reversible change of the
electrical conductivity of PCMs have been carried out to develop the
nonvolatile phase change random access memories (PCRAMs)3 as a strong contender for replacing Flash and
mechanical hard disk. More recently, PCMs have become attractive material
platforms for tunable optoelectronics and photonics.4−6 All of these applications capitalize on either the large optical
or electrical contrast of PCMs between the crystalline and amorphous
phases. Despite the prevalence of PCMs in both optics and electronics,
the studies of PCMs for spintronic applications are scarce. The attempt
of introducing spin degree of freedom into PCMs was initiated by Song
et al.7 Ge2Sb2Te5 was doped with a small amount of iron atoms and phase-dependent
ferromagnetism appeared at low temperature.7 A potential application of doped ferromagnetic PCM is the fast manipulation
of magnetic properties by the phase change mechanism. By using Mn
as an alternative doping element, Adam et al. also reported phase-dependent
ferromagnetism at low temperature.8 In
fact, doping semiconductors with transition metals has been a main
way to realize ferromagnetism in otherwise nonmagnetic semiconductors.
However, experimental demonstration of materials with high Curie temperature
remains a major challenge to magnetic semiconductor research. To this
end, the electronic properties of transition-metal-doped PCMs have
been investigated theoretically.9−13 Cr has been predicted to be the most promising doping element for
magnetic PCMs with high Curie temperature up to 239 K which is, however,
still too low for real applications.11 Moreover,
these studies have suggested that suitable transition-metal dopants
for magnetic PCMs are very limited. Recently, Sc dopants are found
to assist ultrafast crystallization of PCMs, but, unfortunately, they
do not induce any ferromagnetism.14,15 Therefore,
identifying alternative routes toward phase change spintronics other
than doping PCMs is still essential.

Nanodevices generally require
the integration of different materials,
such as dielectric and electrode material, into heterostructures.
An example is the metal/PCM/metal sandwich structure for PCRAMs, in
which the metal electrodes provide suitable electrical contact with
the PCM interlayer which actively tailors the electrical conductivity
of the device through the phase change mechanism. Recently, the use
of the phase change mechanism to tune the electronic properties of
graphene as the electrode(s) has been proposed.16,17 A second example is the ITO/PCM/ITO structure for phase change optoelectronics,
as proposed by Hosseini et al.4 Indium
tin oxide (ITO) is a special type of electrode, both metallic and
transparent to visible light, making electrically switchable color
pixels possible. PCMs actively tailor the optical reflectivity/refractivity
of this structure through the phase change mechanism. Ferromagnet/nonferromagnet/ferromagnet
structure is the basis of modern spintronic devices, including magnetic
random access memories (MRAMs) and spin valves. The ferromagnet serves
as both metallic electrode and spin polarizer. The magnetization orientations
of the two ferromagnetic electrodes, parallel or antiparallel, determine
the device resistance and can be modified magnetically or electrically.
The nonferromagnet interlayer serves as a tunneling barrier which
is normally magnetically and electrically inactive. The use of metallic,
insulating, and semiconducting interlayers has been reported.18−22 Gajek et al. reported the use of a ferroelectric material as the
interlayer and demonstrated doubled resistance states (four) compared
with devices using traditional interlayer materials (two states).23 This is attributed to the electrically active
property of the ferroelectric interlayer, that is, the switchable
electrical polarization. PCM is another type of electrically active
material, showing various attractive properties, such as fast phase
transition and large electrical and optical contrast between different
phases. Huang et al. experimentally demonstrated that the phase change
mechanism could be used to tailor the anisotropic magnetoresistance
and the giant magnetoresistance of a PCM/ferromagnet stacking structure.24 Therefore, we envision the possibility of using
PCMs as tunable interlayer materials in the future spintronic devices,
giving rise to a new phase change mechanism to manipulate spin transport
and thus adding new functionalities and modes of operation to the
devices. As the first step toward this modality of phase change spintronics,
it is important to understand the electronic structures of the interface
of PCM and the selected ferromagnetic material.

An important
requirement for spintronic devices is the ability
to generate high degree of spin polarization at the ferromagnetic
electrodes. Using a half-metallic ferromagnetic Heusler alloy as the
spin polarizer is a promising approach to realize perfect spin injection.
Half-metallicity indicates 100% spin polarization at the Fermi level,
that is, only one spin band is occupied.25,26 A variety of ferromagnetic Heusler alloys such as Co2FeSi and Co2FeAl are predicted to be half-metallic when
fully ordered. Spin injection into GaAs through Co2FeSi
has shown efficiency slightly above 50%, among the highest reported
values to date.27 First-principles calculations
have proven to be effective in guiding the advances in PCMs.28 In this work, we perform first-principles calculations
to study the electronic structures of c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl and c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeSi interfaces, providing important
insights into this tentative phase change spintronic framework for
the follow-up experiments.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Bulk c-Ge2Sb2Te5, Co2FeAl, and Co2FeSi
The
atomic structure of crystalline cubic Ge2Sb2Te5 used in this work follows that of Tsafack et al.29 In the hexagonal representation, the unit cell
has 30 atomic layers including layers of structural vacancy. The cubic
phase of Ge2Sb2Te5 is metastable
and therefore allows fast phase transition in conventional phase change
memory devices.30,31 Recently, a new interfacial phase
change mechanism has been reported which differs from the conventional
bulk phase change mechanism.32 In this
interfacial structure, the stable hexagonal phase of Ge2Sb2Te5 is found to be relevant.33 This makes sense because there is no bulk phase
transformation and therefore the structure has to be stable. The unit
cell structure is relaxed by generalized gradient approximation (GGA)
functional in CASTEP.34,35 We employ ultrasoft pseudopotentials
and 330 eV cutoff energy. The calculated band gap of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 is 0.45 eV, slightly smaller than the
hybrid functional result but close to the experimental value of order
0.5 eV.36,37 We notice that several works have reported
even smaller GGA band gaps for cubic Ge2Sb2Te5 that range from 0.1 to 0.37 eV.29,36,38 For Co2FeAl and Co2FeSi, they crystallize in the L21 structure. We relax
these two unit cell structures by GGA functional and obtain lattice
constants of 5.64 and 5.55 Å for Co2FeAl and Co2FeSi, respectively, close to the experimental values.39,40 It has been reported that GGA functional fails to give the correct
magnetic moment of Co2FeSi.41,42 This is partially
due to the nearly closed GGA band gap in the minority spin channel
and the Fermi level lies in the conduction band. We perform spin-unconstrained
GGA + U calculation on the electronic structures
of Co2FeAl and Co2FeSi and follow Khosravizadeh
et al. to use medium-effective U parameter UCo = 2.5 eV and UFe = 2.5 eV.43−45 It opens the band gaps in the minority spin channels
to about 0.75 eV for both Heusler alloys. The magnetic moment of a
Co2FeSi unit cell is also greatly improved from 5.0 μB by GGA to 5.8 μB by GGA + U, close to the integer experimental value of 6 μB. The Fermi level now lies around the threshold of the conduction
band in the minority spin channel, comparable to the previous GGA
+ U results.45−47 It is reported that the hybrid
functional can further increase the band gap so that the Fermi level
unambiguously lies within the band gap.47 Nevertheless, minor deviation of the Fermi level around the band
edge should not affect the schematic energy band alignment across
the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Heusler-alloy interface.
For Co2FeAl, the Fermi level lies around the valence band
edge and the unit cell has an integer magnetic moment of 5 μB. It should be emphasized that all GGA + U calculations are performed on GGA-relaxed structures. To justify
the reliability of this approach, we also relax the Co2FeX structures by GGA + U and find that the resulting
lattice constants are close to those obtained by GGA. In particular,
the GGA + U and GGA lattice constants of Co2FeSi (Co2FeAl) are 0.40 nm (0.41 nm) and 0.39 nm (0.40
nm), respectively.

2.2 c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl Interface
The in-plane
lattice parameters
of the (111) surface of Co2FeSi (0.39 nm) and Co2FeAl (0.40 nm) are comparable to those of the (0001) surface of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 in the hexagonal representation
(0.42 nm), and the sublattice of Co (or Fe/Si) bares resemblance to
the rock-salt lattice of c-Ge2Sb2Te5. We build supercell models for epitaxial interfaces of (0001) c-Ge2Sb2Te5/(111)Heusler-alloy by fixing
the in-plane lattice parameters to those of c-Ge2Sb2Te5. This leads to 7.6% (5.0%) biaxial tensile
strain on Co2FeSi (Co2FeAl). The lattice perpendicular
to the interface is allowed to relax by GGA functional, thus mitigating
the in-plane strain effect on the electronic structures. The total
energy is converged to 0.0001 eV. There are various surface terminations
for (0001) c-Ge2Sb2Te5 and (111)
Heusler-alloy. We first consider the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl interfaces by all possible combinations
of surface terminations (for Te termination, we only consider nonstoichiometric
termination). To investigate the electronic and magnetic properties
of the interface, we perform spin-unconstrained GGA + U calculation. The partial density of states (PDOSs) of a central
Te atom in c-Ge2Sb2Te5 and the interfacial
and central Co, Fe, and Al atoms in Co2FeAl are examined. Figures 1–4 show the
representative interface structures and the corresponding PDOSs. Electron
localization function (ELF) is used to visualize the bonds. This approach
avoids the ambiguities in bond determination by setting a bond length
cutoff. ELF is localized between neighboring atoms in c-Ge2Sb2Te5, indicating the covalent nature, whereas
it is highly delocalized within Co2FeX, indicating the
metallic nature. The ELF also shows that an interfacial Te/Ge atom
forms covalent or ionic bond with a subinterfacial Si/Al atom. We
also find that, however, no interface is genuine half-metallic and
that the PDOSs of all interfacial atoms on the Co2FeAl
side show interface states fully occupying the band gap in the minority
spin channel. These detrimental interface states mainly have d characteristics
from interfacial Fe and Co and are possibly enhanced by p–d
hybridization with interfacial Ge, Sb, or Te to be broader in energy
and spatially more extended. Degraded half-metallicity in Heusler-alloy
surfaces and semiconductor/Heusler-alloy interfaces has been routinely
reported and is considered as one of the culprits for much lower spin
injection efficiency than theoretical prediction.45−48 Yet genuine half-metallic interfaces
can in principle be restored by proper material selection and interface
engineering,49 which is subject to future
study for the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Heusler-alloy
interface.

In the central region of Co2FeAl, the PDOSs exhibit
bulk properties so that the band alignment is well defined. We identify
two types of band alignments. For Te termination, the conduction band
minimum (CBM) of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 lines
up with the valence band maximum (VBM) of Co2FeAl in the
minority spin channel, and therefore, the Fermi level lies around
the CBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 at the interface,
as shown in Figure 1b. While in Ge and Sb termination, the VBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 lines up with the VBM of Co2FeAl
in the minority spin channel, and therefore, the Fermi level lies
around the VBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5, as
shown in Figure 2b.
These two types of band alignments are mainly determined by the termination
of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 and less affected
by Co2FeAl termination. The electron affinities of free
c-Ge2Sb2Te5 surfaces and the work
function of free Co2FeAl surfaces of different terminations
are examined. Te termination of the c-Ge2Sb2Te5 surface has electron affinity (EA) about 1.0 eV larger
than that of Ge or Sb termination (see Figure S1). This is consistent with the calculated trend of band alignments
with surface termination of c-Ge2Sb2Te5, according to the simple Schottky–Mott rule.50,51 Surface orientation and termination-dependent EAs are not uncommon,
and an anion-terminated surface normally has larger EA than a cation-terminated
one, as have been reported for ZnO,52 GaAs,53 CdTe,54 and so forth.
In a simple ionic model of c-Ge2Sb2Te5, +2, +3, and −2 charge states can be assigned to Ge, Sb,
and Te, respectively. Thus, the Te-terminated surface has surface
dipole pointing toward the interior c-Ge2Sb2Te5 slab which lowers the potential inside (see Figure S1). On the other hand, different Co2FeAl terminations have variance of work functions of 0.4 eV
at most. The relative insensitivity of band alignments to Co2FeAl terminations, however, indicates Fermi level pinning (FLP) to
certain extent. Fang et al. reported appreciable FLP to the charge
neutrality level (CNL) of nitrogen-doped amorphous Ge2Sb2Te5 which is located near the VBM.55 The CNL is a weighted average of the valence and conduction
band DOS. We calculate and find that the CNL of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 lies 0.1 eV above the VBM. It is also of interest
to look at the surface electronic structures of c-Ge2Sb2Te5. We find that the empty Te DB lies just above
the VBM and the occupied Ge/Sb DB lies near the CBM. The average of
their DB energies does not track its CNL, which is in contrast to
conventional group V and III–V semiconductors.56 The metal-induced gap states (MIGS) model states that the
Fermi level is pinned near the CNL of the semiconductor.57,58 However, the MIGS model cannot explain the c-Ge2Sb2Te5 termination-dependent band alignments because
MIGS and CNL are intrinsic properties of the bulk semiconductor and
should not depend on interface geometries. A model that takes chemical
bonding polarity into consideration or the extrinsic interface defect
model may be useful in understanding the FLP in this case.59

c-Ge2Sb2Te5 is usually a p-type
semiconductor and this has been attributed to the existence of intrinsic
Ge/Sb vacancies.60 Tong et al. measured
the Fermi energy of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 to
be below the VBM, indicating c-Ge2Sb2Te5 to be a degenerate p-type semiconductor.61 For its application in spintronic devices, hole injection
is therefore more relevant. As we have seen, c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl with Te termination has
a large p-type Schottky barrier height (p-SBH) for the majority spin
channel. Given the heavy hole doping in c-Ge2Sb2Te5, however, the Schottky barrier can be thin enough
to become a tunneling barrier so that the contact becomes practically
Ohmic, as shown in Figure 1c. Moreover, this natural tunneling barrier obviates the need
for a discrete layer like MgO to alleviate the conductivity mismatch
which impedes high spin injection efficiency.62−64 Therefore,
the problem of occasional hole injection in the minority spin channel
can be mitigated. For the interface with Ge/Sb termination, the p-SBH
for the majority spin channel is nearly zero which provides low resistivity.
However, the valence band offset (VBO) for the minority spin channel
is also small such that minority spin injection cannot be blocked,
as shown in Figure 2c. Occasional minority spin injection occurs as a result of, for
example, non-quasi-particle state-induced gap states and the minority
gap reduction which may vanish the half-metallicity.65,66 Co2FeAl has its Fermi level near the VBM of the minority
spin channel which is susceptible to these thermal instabilities.

2.3 c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeSi Interface
Finally, we study the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeSi interfaces.
Similar to their Co2FeAl counterparts, none of the combinations
of surface terminations lead to genuine half-metallic interface. Only
in the central region of Co2FeSi do the PDOSs restore the
bulk properties that we use to analyze band alignments. The substitution
of Al by Si increases the number of valence electrons which can be
seen as electron doping, in consistence with the upward shift of the
Fermi level from near VBM in Co2FeAl to near CBM in Co2FeSi. For all interfaces with Te termination, except for the
combination of Te–Si termination, the VBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 lines up with the VBM of Co2FeSi in the minority spin channel, as shown in Figure 3b. The Fermi level lies near the CBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5, which is the same as in c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl interfaces
of Te termination. The majority spin channel has large p-SBH at the
interface, but the heavy hole doping of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 may still make the barrier thin enough for Ohmic contact
in practice, as mentioned above. The minority spin channel forms a
heavily doped p–n junction (tunneling diode), and during hole
injection from Co2FeSi to c-Ge2Sb2Te5, it is reverse-biased. This triggers band-to-band
tunneling (BTBT) of electrons in the minority spin channel from the
valence band of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 to the
conduction band of Co2FeSi, equivalent to hole injection
in the minority spin channel from Co2FeSi to c-Ge2Sb2Te5, as shown in Figure 3c. The tunneling barrier, however, is itself
a remedy for the degradation of spin polarization due to these thermal
instabilities, as mentioned above. For interfaces with Ge/Sb termination,
the VBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5 lines up with
the CBM of Co2FeSi in the minority spin channel, as shown
in Figure 4b. The Fermi
level lies near the VBM of c-Ge2Sb2Te5, which is also the same as in c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl interfaces of Ge/Sb termination. For majority
spin injection, the contact is Ohmic with nearly zero p-SBH. The minority
spin channel forms a type II broken gap p–n junction, and during
hole injection from Co2FeSi to c-Ge2Sb2Te5, it is reverse-biased, resulting in immediate injection
of electrons from c-Ge2Sb2Te5 to
Co2FeSi, equivalent to hole injection in the minority spin
channel from Co2FeSi to c-Ge2Sb2Te5, as shown in Figure 4c. This decreases the spin injection efficiency. A type II
staggered gap interface has been found for GaAs/Co2FeSi
in the minority spin channel by first-principles calculations,45 which may also suffer from BTBT in the minority
spin channel when p-type GaAs is used. Now, we return to see the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl interface
with the combination of Te termination and Si termination. The band
alignment of this interface is similar to those of its Ge/Sb termination
counterparts. This may be due to the fact that Si is more electronegative
than Fe and Co and the polarity of interfacial bonding changes dramatically
from Fe/Co–Te to Te–Si. Al does not have the problem
because it has electronegativity comparable to those of Fe and Co.
As mentioned before, taking the polarity of interfacial bonding explicitly
into account is useful to understand the nature of band line-up in
this case. Actually, we model the Te-terminated c-Ge2Sb2Te5 surface with a surface Si adatom which is equivalent
to the substitution of topmost Ge by Si in the Ge-terminated surface.
The EA of such surface is 0.9 eV smaller than that of the pristine
Te-terminated surface but still a bit larger than that of the Ge-/Sb-terminated
one. This is the reason of close resemblance of the band alignment
to its Ge/Sb termination counterparts. The interfaces with Ge/Sb termination
are less sensitive to Co2FeSi terminations because they
form nonpolar interface bonding.

We have calculated the c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeAl and c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeSi interfaces
of different combinations of terminations. The Te termination (except
for c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeSi
interface of Te–Si termination) of both classes of interfaces
is preferred from our band alignment analysis. In addition, first-principles
calculations by Deringer and Dronskowski showed that for hexagonal
Ge2Sb2Te5, Te termination is stable
over the range of permissible chemical potential.67 On the other hand, the flexible electronic structures of
Heusler alloys offer the toolbox for realizing functionalities as
desired. We show here that the electronic structures of c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeX interfaces are tunable
by the substitution of main group element X. Fecher and Felseret studied
the composition-dependent electronic structures of Co2FeAl1–xSix and
found that the Fermi levels of Co2FeAl and Co2FeSi can be shifted away from band edges,68 as required by the temperature stability of bulk half-metallicity.
It is also critical to find a guide rule for the selection of Heusler
alloys for specific spacer materials to realize genuine half-metallic
interfaces and suitable band alignments to for spin functionalities.

3 Conclusions
To summarize, we propose a tentative
modality of phase change spintronic
devices, namely, a ferromagnet/PCM/ferromagnet structure. Using PCM
as the semiconducting interlayer gives rise to a new possibility of
manipulating spin transport through phase change, adding new functionalities
and modes of operation to the device. The electronic structures of
c-Ge2Sb2Te5/Co2FeX (X:
Al, Si) interfaces of all combinations of terminations are studied
by GGA + U method. None of them is genuine half-metallic,
indicating that there is enough room for improvement. The interface
band alignments are studied and preferable combinations of terminations
as demanded by high spin injection efficiency are found. This work
provides useful insights for follow-up experiments.
