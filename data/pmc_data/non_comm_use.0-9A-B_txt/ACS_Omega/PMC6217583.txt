A facile, sensitive, and label-free
aptamer-based fluorescent biosensor
(aptasensor) for chloramphenicol (CAP) detection was successfully
developed based on an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) probe and
graphene oxide (GO). In this aptasensor, the specific aptamer of CAP
(C-Apt) is used as the recognition part, an AIE molecule, 9,10-distyrylanthracene
(DSA) derivative with short alkyl chains (9,10-bis{4-[2-(N,N,N-trimethylammonium)-ethoxy]styrene}anthracene
dibromide, DSAC2N), as the fluorescent probe, and GO with
a low oxidation degree as the fluorescent quencher. Initially, the
AIE probe DSAC2N and C-Apt could be adsorbed on GO through
π-stacking interactions, and the fluorescence of DSAC2N could be efficiently quenched due to the energy transfer between
DSAC2N and GO. When CAP is added, C-Apt can preferentially
bind with CAP and the newly formed complex (C-Apt–CAP) can
be released from GO, resulting in the recovery of the fluorescence
signal of DSAC2N. Thus, with the aid of GO, turn-on detection
of CAP can be readily realized by monitoring the fluorescence signal
of DSAC2N from “off” to “on”.
Under the optimized conditions, the aptasensor exhibits a high sensitivity
toward CAP with a limit of detection of 1.26 pg/mL. Besides, we have
successfully applied this aptasensor to the detection of CAP in spiked
milk.

1 Introduction
As a broad-spectrum antibiotic,
chloramphenicol (CAP) has been
widely used in the field of treatment of a variety of bacterial infections.1,2 However, CAP is easy to accumulate in liver once it is absorbed
into the body from food and medicine, resulting in many serious side
effects on human beings, such as leukemia, gray baby syndrome, and
aplastic anemia.3,4 And the European Union has established
the “minimum required performance limit” value of CAP
as 0.3 × 10–6 g/kg for the detection of its
residues in food products. Therefore, it is of considerable important
to develop ultrasensitive approaches for CAP determination.

Traditionally, CAP residues were mainly detected by gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) with excellent sensitivity and reliability.5−7 However, the above methods usually require expensive equipments
and complicated operation procedures. Then, some detection methods
based on immunoassay are developed with higher specificity, shorter
analysis time, and simple sample processing.8−10 Nevertheless,
these detection methods generally show some limitations such as poor
sensitivity, accuracy, and stability. Therefore, it is great important
to develop an efficient, simple, economic, and sensitive method for
CAP detection.

In recent years, aptamer-based sensors, aptasensors,
have been
widely developed and used in analytical methods. Aptamers are short
single-strand DNA or RNA molecules that are experimentally selected
by an in vitro technique called systematic evolution of ligands by
exponential enrichment.11,12 They can be used as
recognition reagents and bind to various targets with high specificity
and binding affinity. Owing to the superior characteristics of easier
modification, low cost, and better stability over antibodies, numerous
aptasensors for CAP detection including fluorescent biosensor, colorimetric
assay, electrochemical analysis, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering
are constructed.13−17 Among these methods, fluorescent biosensors have attracted increasing
attention due to their characteristics of simplicity, high specificity,
and high sensitivity. And various fluorophores, such as inorganic
quantum dots and organic molecules, have been developed as fluorescent
probes for sensing platform. However, most of the biosensors require
dye-labeled or modified aptamers, which have several critical defects
of complicated operation, low labeling efficiency, and expensive cost.
Additionally, the fluorescence emission of most traditional fluorophores
is often quenched when bound with the molecules, which can be called
aggregation-caused quenching (ACQ),18,19 and compel
the biosensors to operate in a fluorescent “turn-off”
mode.

The appearance of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorescent
probes effectively solves the ACQ problem of traditional organic probes
and provides new approaches and methods for the development of “turn-on”
and label-free fluorescent biosensors.20−22 To be specific, AIE-active
molecules are almost nonemissive in dilute solution states but show
strong fluorescence emission in the aggregated states, resulting in
a turn-on fluorescent signal with better accuracy and higher sensitivity
for the sensing platform.23,24 Based on the characteristic,
a series of AIE fluorophores have been designed and utilized as fluorescent
indicators in biosensors. However, it is a pity that most of the AIE-based
sensors have no selectivity. Because the probe and target molecules
are usually combined through electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions,
AIE probes will also have the similar fluorescence response to other
interferent in addition to the target molecules, which seriously affects
the selectivity of the sensing platform.

Graphene oxide (GO),
a novel two-dimensional carbon nanomaterial
with unique physicochemical properties, shows an advantageous application
prospect in the fabrication of electrochemical, colorimetric, and
fluorescent aptasensors because of its excellent biocompatibility,
water solubility, and fluorescent quenching ability. Especially, it
can interact with various inorganic, organic, and biological molecules
through covalent, noncovalent, or electrostatic interactions, resulting
in higher-sensitivity and -selectivity aptasensors by introducing
it to the sensing platform.25,26 Inspired by these studies,
our group constructed several fluorescent aptasensors by integrating
AIE probes and GO, and we found that the analytical performance of
the assay can be significantly improved by tuning the supramolecular
interactions of AIE probe and GO with DNA.27

Herein, we developed a sensitive, facile, and turn-on fluorescent
aptasensor for CAP detection by combining an AIE DSA derivative with
short alkyl chains (DSAC2N) as the fluorescent probe, the
highly specific aptamer as the recognition element and GO with low
oxidation degree as the fluorescence quencher. Upon the addition of
CAP, the fluorescence signal of the sensing platform can turn from
“off” to “on”, and the quantification
of CAP can be consequently realized with easy operation, low cost,
favorable stability, and high selectivity and sensitivity. Moreover,
the assay approach exhibited excellent analytical performance during
the determination of CAP in milk samples.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Sensing Strategy
The sensing strategy
of the fluorescent biosensor based on probe DSAC2N and
GO is illustrated in Scheme 1. The fluorescent probe DSAC2N has good water solubility
and shows typical AIE properties. It has almost no fluorescence in
the dispersion state. After adding the aptamer of CAP (C-Apt), the
fluorescence of DSAC2N can be enhanced due to the formation
of the aggregation complex (DSAC2N/C-Apt). The cation probe
DSAC2N can bind with C-Apt through electrostatic attraction
and hydrophobic interaction, resulting in the formation of DSAC2N/C-Apt complex and the fluorescence enhancement because of
the restricted intramolecular torsion between the 9,10-anthylene core
and the vinylene segment of DSAC2N in the aggregate state.
When the GO is introduced, the complex DSAC2N/C-Apt can
be adsorbed on the surface of GO due to the hydrogen bond and the
π–π stacking interaction with GO, resulting in
efficient fluorescence quenching of DSAC2N via the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) from DSAC2N to GO. When
the target molecule CAP is added, C-Apt can specifically bind with
CAP and form the C-Apt–CAP complex, and the tertiary structure
of C-Apt changes accordingly. Consequently, C-Apt–CAP can be
released from GO due to the weak interaction between them. Meanwhile,
DSAC2N can be still adsorbed on C-Apt–CAP, and the
fluorescence of the solution will be gradually recovered due to the
aggregation of the probe. Therefore, by monitoring the changes in
the fluorescence signal of DSAC2N with CAP addition (from
off to on), we can easily realize the supersensitive detection of
CAP.

Scheme 1 Sensing Principle for CAP Detection
2.2 Fluorescent Response of the Probe
The fluorescent emission spectra of DSAC2N (10.0 μM)
under different conditions are illustrated in Figure 1. In the case of without GO, the fluorescence
intensity of DSAC2N/C-Apt–CAP complex (spectrum
(3)) is somewhat higher than that of DSAC2N/C-Apt complex
(spectrum (2)) (Figure 1a). The small fluorescence intensity difference indicates that the
background noise of the system is too big, which severely limits the
sensitivity of the sensing platform for the detection of CAP. Surprisingly,
when introducing GO into the sensing platform, as shown in Figure 1b, the fluorescence
of both DSAC2N in dispersed state (spectrum (1)) and DSAC2N/C-Apt complexes (spectrum (2)) is quenched by GO. After
the addition of CAP, most of the C-Apt molecules detach from GO due
to the formation of the C-Apt–CAP complex, leading to an obvious
increase in the fluorescence of DSAC2N (spectrum (3)).
The sensing platform based on GO, aptamer, and AIE probe can successfully
distinguish the target substance, CAP, due to the obvious difference
in fluorescence intensity before and after adding the target substance.

buffer, (2) DSAC2N + C-Apt, and (3) DSAC2N +
C-Apt + CAP.

2.3 Feasibility
of the Fluorescent Aptasensor
To investigate the quenching
ability of GO, we investigated the
fluorescence quenching kinetics in the sensing platform. As shown
in Figure 2, when DSAC2N was combined with C-Apt, the solution had a strong fluorescence
emission. With the continuous addition of GO, the fluorescence intensity
of the solution dropped sharply and was quenched rapidly. The double
logarithm regression curve of DSAC2N and GO is shown in Figure 3. The binding constant Ka of DSAC2N and GO was calculated
to be 13.10 L/g according to the double logarithm regression equation.28

different
concentrations of GO. Experimental conditions: 10 μM DSAC2N, 150 nM C-Apt, 3–25 μg/mL GO, 20 mM Tris–HCl
buffer solution (pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

Experimental conditions: 150 nM C-Apt, 10 μM DSAC2N, 3–25 μg/mL GO, 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer solution
(pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

On the other hand, the binding affinity of the formed C-Apt–CAP
with DSAC2N was investigated, so that the supramolecular
interactions within the aptasensor were explored. The binding constant
of DSAC2N with C-Apt–CAP complex was evaluated through
a fluorescence titration experiment. It can be found that the fluorescent
intensity of DSAC2N increases gradually with the increasing
amounts of the C-Apt–CAP complex (Figure 4a). Figure 4b shows the Benesi–Hildebrand plot of DSAC2N and the C-Apt–CAP complex, and the binding constant Kb of DSAC2N and C-Apt–CAP
was calculated to be 18.40 L/g.29 It is
clear that Kb > Ka, indicating that the binding capacity between DSAC2N and C-Apt–CAP complex is stronger than that between DSAC2N and GO, ensuring that DSAC2N can aggregate on
the C-Apt–CAP complex and light the fluorescence signal of
DSAC2N sufficiently.

increasing amounts of C-Apt–CAP complex. (b) Benesi–Hildebrand
plot of DSAC2N and C-Apt–CAP complex. Experimental
conditions: 10 μM DSAC2N, 0–60 ng/mL C-Apt–CAP,
20 mM Tris–HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

2.4 Sensitivity
of the Fluorescent Aptasensor
The fluorescent spectra of
DSAC2N in the presence of
different CAP concentrations were recorded, so that the sensitivity
of the fluorescent aptasensor was investigated. As illustrated in Figure 5a, with increase
in the CAP concentration, the fluorescent intensity of DSAC2N is gradually enhanced, indicating that more and more C-Apt–CAP
complexes were formed in the system, and the aggregation degree of
DSAC2N gradually increased, resulting in gradual enhancement
in the fluorescence signal. Figure 5b shows the relationship between the fluorescent intensity
of DSAC2N and the concentration of CAP, and the inset in Figure 5b exhibits the linear
part of this relationship at the low concentration of CAP. It can
be seen that when the concentration of CAP reaches 10 ng/mL, the fluorescence
intensity of the solution no longer increases greatly and gradually
tends to be stable, indicating the interaction between C-Apt and CAP
gradually tends to balance and saturate; accordingly, the combination
of DSAC2N and C-Apt–CAP is saturated gradually.
The limit of detection (LOD) was calculated to be 1.26 pg/mL (LOD
= 3σ/κ, where σ is the standard deviation of the
three blank measurements (without CAP) and κ is the slope of
the fluorescence intensity of DSAC2N relative to the CAP
concentration).

of different concentrations of CAP. (b) Plot of fluorescence intensity
at 535 nm vs CAP concentration. Inset: linear part of the plot in
(b). Experimental conditions: 10 μM DSAC2N, 9 μg/mL
GO, 150 nM C-Apt, 0–100 ng/mL CAP, 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer
solution (pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

2.5 Selectivity of the Fluorescent
Aptasensor
The selectivity of the sensing platform to CAP
was investigated.
The controlled experiments were carried out under the same experimental
conditions by selecting several common antibiotics such as chlortetracycline
(CTC), thiamphenicol (TAP), florfenicol (FF), tetracycline (TC), ampicillin
(APC), kanamycin (Kana), bovine serum albumin (BSA), and oxytetracycline
(OTC) as the interfering molecules (Figure 6). We can find that only in the presence
of CAP, the fluorescence intensity of DSAC2N has a great
enhancement. Nevertheless, the fluorescence intensity of DSAC2N is very weak when adding the above interfering molecules
instead of CAP, indicating that these interfering molecules cannot
form a complex with C-Apt and accordingly cannot bring obvious effect
to the raising of the fluorescence intensity of DSAC2N.
It strongly confirms that this sensing platform has good selectivity
to CAP.

Figure 6 Fluorescent spectra of DSAC2N in the presence of different
interfering molecules. Experimental conditions: 10 μM DSAC2N, 9 μg/mL GO, 150 nM C-Apt, 10 ng/mL CAP, interfering
molecules, 20 mM Tris–HCl buffer solution (pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

We also listed some literature
reports about fluorescent biosensors
for detecting CAP in Table 1. As to the selectivity, we investigated more kinds of interfering
molecules than the cited articles, and our fluorescent biosensor exhibited
a good selectivity to CAP against eight kinds of interfering molecules.
Moreover, the LOD of our fluorescent biosensor is much lower than
that of the cited articles except for the last one. In addition, the
fluorescent biosensor in this work is much simpler, of lower cost,
and more environment-friendly than those in the cited articles because
they either need modified DNA or aptamer (nos 4 and 6) or need materials
containing heavy metal (nos 3 and 5).

2.6 Detection of CAP in Milk Samples
To evaluate the feasibility
of the fluorescent aptasensor in practical
applications, we detect the CAP in milk by adding different concentrations
of CAP solutions into the diluted milk samples (5%) under the same
conditions. As shown in Figure 7a, when the milk sample was used as the matrix, the fluorescence
of DSAC2N was much stronger and the fluorescence peak blue-shifted
about 20 nm than that in the buffer solution. It indicates that DSAC2N molecules interact with other substances in the milk sample
at the same time, which changes the molecular energy levels of DSAC2N, so the emission peak of DSAC2N in the buffer
solution has a blue-shift compared with that in the milk. Figure 7b shows the fluorescence
response of DSAC2N at different CAP concentrations. It
is clear that with the increasing concentration of CAP, the fluorescence
intensity of the system increased steadily. The detection limit was
calculated to be 0.36 ng/mL. These results confirm the feasibility
and reliability of our sensing platform in monitoring CAP in real
samples.

buffer solution (pH = 7.4), and λex = 405 nm.

3 Conclusions
A facile, sensitive, and label-free fluorescent aptasensor was
developed by using an AIE molecule DSAC2N as the fluorescence
probe, the low oxidation degree GO as the fluorescence quenching agent
and specific nucleic acid aptamer C-Apt as the recognition part, realizing
the ultrasensitive and specific detection of CAP. In absence of CAP,
C-Apt and DSAC2N can be adsorbed on GO, and the fluorescence
of DSAC2N is quenched by GO due to the FRET interaction
between DSAC2N and GO, and the solution exhibits no fluorescence.
After adding CAP, a C-Apt–CAP complex is formed by the virtue
of the specific binding of C-Apt and CAP, resulting in the leaving
of C-Apt from the surface of GO. As the binding force between DSAC2N and C-Apt–CAP is stronger than that between DSAC2N and GO, DSAC2N separates from the GO and aggregated
on the surface of the C-Apt–CAP complex, and accordingly the
fluorescence of the solution turns on. The results indicate that C-Apt
cannot specifically bind with other antibiotics, so the fluorescent
biosensor platform has a good selectivity to CAP. Moreover, we also
applied this fluorescent aptasensor to the detection of CAP in milk
samples. The sensing strategy can be applied to other target molecules
detection thanks to its advantages of simple operation, high sensitivity,
strong specificity, and excellent universality.

All the reagents and starting
materials were commercially available and were used without further
purification. The detailed synthesis and characterization of DSAC2N has been reported in our previous work.27 GO was also obtained from our previous work.27 Chloramphenicol (CAP), tetracycline (TC), thiamphenicol
(TAP), and ethanol were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical

The crystal of C-Apt was dissolved in deionized water and the concentration
of the C-Apt solution was measured by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.
