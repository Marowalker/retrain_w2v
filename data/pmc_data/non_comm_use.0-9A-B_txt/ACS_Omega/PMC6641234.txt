Two
initially neutral semiconductor quantum dots with appropriate
band offsets can participate in a ground state charge transfer process.
The charge transfer manifests itself in the form of bleaching of optical
transitions and also causes the quantum dots to precipitate from solution,
giving rise to assemblies with unusual properties. As this represents
a postsynthetic modification of the electronic structure of quantum
dots, it holds tremendous potential for improving the characteristics
of quantum dot devices. Here, we study the dependencies of the properties
of these assemblies on the structure of the participating quantum
dots. In particular, we find that for assemblies formed out of Cu:CdS
and ZnTe/CdS quantum dots, the composition of the assembly varies
from 1:1.26 to 1:0.23 ZnTe/CdS to Cu:CdS as the shell thickness of
CdS in ZnTe/CdS is increased. In contrast, the composition changes
from 1:1.1 to 1:15 for PbSe/CdSe and Cu:CdS quantum dots, as the size
of the PbSe core is increased. These observations are explained on
the basis of a phenomenological thermodynamic model. The applicability
of thermodynamics to this example of self-assembly is verified empirically.

Introduction
The electronic states
of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) can be
engineered in numerous ways. While the design of core/shell architectures
enables precise control over wave functions,1−4 the intentional inclusion of dopants
allows for the introduction of custom electronic states. In this regard,
ground-state charge transfer between QDs offers the potential of a
postsynthetic modification of QD opto-electronic properties5,6 and is therefore of significant interest to the preparation of QD
devices.4,7−16

A typical example of such a charge transfer is shown in the
schematic
(Figure 1a). This involves
a QD that contains a suitable donor or acceptor level, and another
QD that is capable of accepting/donating charges from/to that level.
The simplest example involves a copper containing QD (e.g., Cu:CdS
or Cu:ZnSe/CdSe17) and another QD based
on PbSe18 or ZnTe.19 In a previous publication, we showed this process to be a ground-state
effect, and no measurable influence of light on the process could
be identified.20 We note that a ligand
shell is expected to lead to hopping times ∼0.1 μs.21 Thick (1 nm) electron-confining shells (e.g.,
with an offset of 1 eV) may slow down tunneling rates further by five
orders of magnitude. The electron tunnel time in these circumstances
is in the order of 10–2 s, which is sufficient to
allow effective charge transfer and equilibration over the timescale
of assembly formation (10–1000 s).

Figure 1 (a) Schematic of QDs
reacting to form a Coulomb-bound assembly.
(b) TEM images of Coulomb-bound assemblies formed out of PbSe/CdSe
and Cu:CdS QDs. Each barrel is an assembly of over 106 QDs.
Scale bars are 100 nm.

Following this charge transfer, the two participating QDs
become
oppositely charged and precipitate from solution, forming an assembly.
While such assemblies lack a crystalline order,20 these show other properties that indicate that these are
a thermodynamic end product. Qualitative indications of a thermodynamic
equilibrium are evidenced in the existence of a well-defined macroscopic
morphology.22,23Figure 1b shows the transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images where a peculiar barrel-like assembly of over a million
QDs is observed. The ability of a large (>106) number
of
QDs to spontaneously seek such peculiar, macroscopically symmetric
configurations provides a strong, though qualitative suggestion regarding
the thermodynamic nature of the assembly process. Other assembly morphologies
are exemplified in Figure S1. Presently,
we are unaware of the parameters responsible for size and shape of
the assembly. Assemblies with the same composition do end up showing
different morphologies, and it is therefore inferred that composition
is not the primary parameter guiding the assembly shape. It is feasible
that different shapes arise from different nuclei; however, the nucleation
process of these assemblies is unclear at the moment. The assemblies
thus formed bear some resemblance to charged granular solids reported
by other researchers.24−27

Here, we study the influence of the QD structure on the properties
of the assemblies. To extract useful parameters relating to the assembly
formation process, we first show that the assembly process is ultimately
determined by thermodynamics, despite the lack of a crystalline order.
Such assemblies can therefore be likened to liquids in that these
lack structure but are characterized by well-defined thermodynamic
parameters. It is further shown that the assembly formation process
has a remarkable ability to seek the free-energy minimum even when
the process is initiated from vastly different starting positions
of the free-energy landscape. We explain the robustness of the assembly
formation process in terms of a phenomenological thermodynamic model.
Specific predictions of the model regarding the effects of the QD
size and structure on assembly composition are validated experimentally.
Finally, the model is used to estimate the free-energy penalty associated
with the creation of an error in composition. The strong (∼1
eV per composition defect) energy penalty associated with creation
of composition errors explains the existence of a fixed characteristic
composition for this type of the QD assembly.

Results and Discussions
Assemblies of QDs were prepared using a procedure similar to the
one reported previously.20 QDs were initially
prepared using the techniques described in the Supporting Information. Both the QD participants in the assembly
process were separated from the original solutions by precipitation
using ethanol. Subsequently, QDs were redispersed in hexane, and any
hexane-insoluble components of the original solution are separated
out. Subsequently, the QDs are again precipitated by the addition
of alcohols. These steps of dissolution and reprecipitation are typically
undertaken three to five times to obtain an optically clear dispersion
of QDs free from unbound ligands and reaction byproducts. If kept
aside, such dispersions are stable for a time period in excess of
a week in the dark. Following the cleaning steps, the two dispersions
of QDs from which the assembly is to be constructed are mixed. Following
mixing, precipitation of the assembly is observed within ∼1
h of standing. The instability exhibited by the combination of QDs
is in contrast to the stability of the individual QD dispersions.
This process may be accelerated by first evaporating the solvent at
room temperature, and subsequently adding fresh solvent. In either
case, it is observed that the precipitation is selective, and a fraction
of QDs remain behind in the solution.

The QD assembly is separated
from the unbound, solvent-dispersed
QDs by decantation followed by several rounds of washing with hexane.
The assembled and unbound QDs are then dried separately and analyzed
further. The total amount of QDs was inferred by adding the amounts
of bound and unbound material.

Validity of Thermodynamic Models
In most cases, the attainment of a crystalline state is used to
justify the applicability of thermodynamics to an assembly process.28−30 While this is a robust criterion in several cases, it is certainly
feasible that a crystalline state may not be the thermodynamic ground
state for a granular solid with arbitrarily complex interactions.
Alternate criteria such as the possibility of attainment of a definite
morphology do qualitatively suggest that the assembly is governed
by thermodynamics;25,31−34 however, a more quantitative
criterion is desirable. We therefore studied the composition of the
assembly formed from the QDs to ascertain the applicability of thermodynamics
in the process.

It is known that the composition of the QD assembly
is largely
independent of the starting quantities of QDs. The results of a typical
experiment are exemplified in Figure 2a. This figure shows the variation in the ratio of
the QDs (1:y) present in assemblies as a function
of the ratios in which they were taken initially. Even though the
initial ratios of the QDs are changed from 1:3 to 1:15, the stoichiometry
is relatively constant at 1:(1.8 ± 0.3). Thus, there is no bearing
of the initial ratios of the QDs on the stoichiometry of the end product.
This implies the existence of a robust mechanism by which QD assemblies
exclude the excess of one type of QD whenever there is a deficit of
the partnering dot. From a thermodynamic perspective, this implies
a unique free-energy minimum, as well as consistent ability of the
system to seek out this minimum under experimental conditions.

Figure 2 (a) Stoichiometry
of Coulomb-bound assemblies formed between two
QDs when the ratios of the participants are changed. These data have
been taken from ref (20). (b) Stoichiometries of various Coulomb-bound assemblies as a function
of starting ratios of QDs. r is the Pearson correlation
of this data set.

A more quantitative view
is presented in Figure 2b. This figure shows the data collected from
24 different assemblies prepared from different sizes and formulations
of QDs. This figure uses Cu:CdS or Cu:ZnSe/CdSe mixed with PbSe- and
ZnTe-based core/shell QDs. Each QD pair has been combined together
twice with a pseudo-random starting ratio of the participating QDs.
The observed composition ratio of the assembly is plotted along the y axis, and the initial ratios of the participating QDs
are plotted along the x axis. Because of the different
types of QDs employed in the assembly preparation, the observed composition
varies widely from 0.06 to 15. At the same time, the initial ratio
of the participating QDs also changes widely over a similar range,
from 0.05 to 9 over the entire data set. Even though both parameters
change over a very similar range of values, the lack of correlation
between these two parameters is immediately apparent. The Pearson
correlation for this scatter plot is observed to be −0.01.
The near-zero value of the Pearson correlation implies that the final
stoichiometry of the assembly is completely unrelated to the starting
ratios of QDs and confirms the existence of a thermodynamically controlled
mechanism of assembly formation. Stated in terms of free energy, the
chemical potentials of QDs in solutions used to prepare the assembly
differ from the ideally required chemical potentials Δμ
= μused – μrequired = RT ln(aused/arequired) by upto 12 kJ/mol in certain cases. The ability
of the assembly process to lead to a unique final composition despite
the strong contrary bias provided by the chemical potential thus implies
ergodicity and the validity of equilibrium thermodynamics for the
type of assembly described here.

Thermodynamic Model for
Assembly Formation
The Born–Haber cycle is frequently
employed to describe
the thermodynamics of ionic compounds. As the interactions guiding
the assembly process are Coulombic, we adopt a similar model. For
simplicity, we first consider an assembly where QDs occur in a 1:1
ratio. Assemblies that contain a different ratio of the two QDs can
be described through straightforward extensions that are presented
later.

The Born–Haber cycle explicitly considers the
sublimation
and/or the dissociation of the original elements, the ionization energy
and the electron affinity, and finally the lattice energy.

Because
of the absence of an underlying lattice structure, it is
further convenient to assume that the assembly comprises pairs of
QDs. In the case of the QD assembly process, individual QDs start
off in their neutral state in an organic solvent, and thus sublimation-/dissociation-like
terms are absent. The ionization energy and electron affinity terms
can be replaced by equivalent terms for QDs. In the strong confinement
regime in particular, it is convenient to split this contribution
into three terms, namely, the offsets present in the bulk semiconductor,
the confinement energy, and lastly the Coulomb energy because of charge
transfer. Finally, it is necessary to include a term corresponding
to lattice energy that accounts for the interactions of the remainder
assembly with a pair of QDs.

We can thus write an expression
for the energy of a 1:1 assembly
for transfer of n electrons (ΔEn,1) 1  Here, P is the potential
arising from offsets between uncharged bulk materials that make up
the QDs, n is the number of electrons transferred
between the QDs, c, c″, c′, are constants related to the medium dielectric
constant, r is the inter QD separation, ϵ is
the change in confinement energy of the electrons when they are transferred
from one QD to another, while a± are
the radii of the charged regions of the two QDs. Cav is the interaction energy of a pair of QDs with the
remaining assembly. In a typical assembly, Coulomb terms are similar
in magnitude, while the confinement term is typically smaller. For
example, P ≈ −0.5 eV for ZnTe/CdS–Cu:CdS.
For n ≈ 10 and a dielectric constant of 10,
the charging terms are also individually as large as 1 eV. The confinement
energy per charge ϵ/n ≈ 0.01–0.5
eV depending on the QD size and charging level. Thus, it is evident
that the assembly formation process is guided largely by classical
effects while quantum mechanics plays a relatively minor role.

The criterion for the amount of charge transferred can be arrived
by setting , which yields  as the criterion for
the number of electrons
transferred in a 1:1 solid.35 As further
shown in the Supporting Information, it
is possible to write an approximate form of these equations for a
1:(1 + x) solid, where x is a small
number. In particular, we obtain  

To simplify the discussion,
here c is any one
of the constants related to the medium dielectric; details are presented
in the Supporting Information. The validity
of this model may be verified empirically by examining the behavior
of this model under different perturbations. We first consider the
situation where the distances between QDs are increased gradually.
The magnitude of the offsite stabilization term, , decreases, while the onsite repulsions,  and , are unchanged.
Both QDs participating
in the assembly process are affected differently by changes in these
terms, and this causes a deviation from a 1:1 participation of both
QDs. As shown in the Supporting Information, it is possible to extract the relationship  to describe changes in the chemical composition
of the assembly induced because of changes in the distances between
QDs. Here, y is the stoichiometric ratio of the positively
charged QD to the negatively charged QD. r is the
interparticle separation and E and F are fitting parameters. This expression shows the relative importance
of classical, interparticle Coulomb interactions in deciding the composition
of the assembly.

The continuous tuning of interparticle separations
in a QD assembly
can be implemented using core/shell QD structures. In the case of
the ZnTe/CdS system, the high CdS valence band offset ensures that
holes remain largely localized to the ZnTe core.19Figure 3a employs an effective mass approach to estimate the confinement
energies of holes at the ZnTe band edge due to growth of a CdS spacer.
This calculation employs parameters used earlier to describe the ZnTe/CdS
system.19 Shell growth is considered to
occur over a core of a radius of 2 nm. As shown in this Figure 3a, increasing thickness of
the CdS shell thus does not cause significant changes in the properties
of electronic states in the vicinity of the ZnTe valence band top
(Figure 3a, black curve).

Figure 3 (a) Energy
of the ZnTe/CdS valence band edge (black), conduction
band edge (red), and band edge excitonic energy (blue) for a 2 nm
ZnTe QD as a function of the total QD diameter. (b) Variation of onsite
electron–electron repulsion (green), nearest neighbor stabilization
(blue), and total Coulomb interaction per electron (red) as a function
of the total QD diameter. This estimate assumes the total charge per
QD to be constant. (c) Variation of stoichiometry of ZnTe/CdS(A) +
Cu/CdS(X) QD assemblies as a function of QD A diameter.

In contrast, the band edge exciton energy (Figure 3a, blue curve) changes
as a consequence of
CdS shell growth, primarily because of a change in electron confinement
(Figure 3a, red curve).
Increasing the CdS shell thickness thus increases the distance between
electronic states of the participating QDs without significantly changing
the density of single-particle levels at the valence band edge. Thus,
a study of assemblies formed out of QDs with different CdS shell thicknesses
provides the same information as the effect of variation of changing
inter-QD separation in a single assembly. The effects of increased
QD separation on the Coulomb interaction terms are shown in Figure 3b. Because holes
are primarily localized to the ZnTe core, the Coulomb charging energy
(Figure 3b, green curve)
does not change as a function of shell thickness. However, the Coulomb
stabilization due to oppositely charged nearest neighbors (Figure 3b, blue curve) decreases
in magnitude as the CdS shell thickness is increased because of an
increase in inter-QD separation. From a Coulomb stabilization viewpoint,
the system thus becomes less suitable for charge transfer as the CdS
shell thickness is increased (Figure 3b, red curve). As shown in Figure 3c, with increasing thickness of the CdS shell,
the amount of Cu:CdS (QD X) in the assembly decreases relative to
the amount of ZnTe/CdS (QD A). The error bars in Figure 3c represent the range of compositions
observed when two nominally identical batches of Cu:CdS QDs are combined
with ZnTe/CdS QDs. Each data point corresponds to the average. The
expression for composition as predicted by the model can be recast
in a slightly different form to better describe this experiment. We
note that the inter-QD distance is the sum of the individual QD radii
and any intermediate ligands. Thus, r = r+ + G and . Here, r+ is
the total radius of the ZnTe/CdS QD. The parameter G represents the radius of the other participating dot as well as
the additional separation caused because of the ligand shell. The
other participating QD has a 2.5 nm radius, while the ligand shell
itself contributes approximately 0.5 nm. We thus take G = 3 nm; only the parameters E and F are allowed to vary during the fitting. As shown in Figure 3c, this provides a reasonable
description of the data, thereby confirming the validity of the proposed
model for the assembly process.

It is further necessary to consider
the validity of this model
in cases where the quantum confinement effects have a small but nonnegligible
influence on the assembly. As smaller QDs have progressively larger
values of confinement, we considered the compositions of assemblies
comprising Cu:CdS- and PbSe-based QDs. The sizes of the PbSe/CdSe
QD core is varied through this experiment. For very small QDs, the
confinement energy increases with the inverse square of the radius
and reduces the ability of small PbSe QDs to effectively participate
in the assembly. For very large PbSe particles, a single particle
can form an assembly with a large number of Cu:CdS QDs, essentially
limited by the QD size.

To explore this further, we synthesized
assemblies formed by Cu:CdS-
and PbSe-based QDs. All PbSe QDs, barring the smallest ones, are protected
with a thin CdSe shell that acts as a protective spacer. However,
instead of varying the spacer thickness as in the previous case, we
vary the size of the PbSe core. In each case, the CdSe shell thickness
is less than 0.6 nm (see Table 1 in the Supporting Information for details). Figure 4a shows the average stoichiometry attained
by using of two identical Cu/CdS samples. The x axis
corresponds to the total PbSe-based QD diameter, including the shell
thickness. The error bars represent the range of stoichiometries observed.
The Cu:CdS QDs have a radius of 2.5 nm and a 1.19% percent copper
inclusion that corresponds to the presence of ∼19 copper ions
per QD. For 2–5 nm PbSe/CdSe QDs, the assembly composition
is observed to be nearly constant with size. Beyond a 5.5 nm size,
the ability of a PbSe/CdSe QD to interact with multiple Cu:CdS QDs
increases rapidly, and the number of Cu:CdS QDs rises to 12 per 7.4
nm PbSe/CdSe dot.

of a stoichiometric defect where a negatively charged QD is removed
and its negative charge is transferred into the other negatively charged
QD at the same center.

As shown in the Supporting Information, it is possible to show that the assembly composition is now given
by  for large deviations away from
a 1:1 stoichiometry.
As shown in Figure 4a, this expression provides an accurate description of the data.

The validity of the proposed thermodynamic model in accounting
for the composition of QD assemblies is thus confirmed. As these assemblies
lack an internal structural order but none the less represent an end
product at the thermodynamic equilibrium,36,37 these bear a stronger resemblance to liquids and glasses rather
than crystalline solids. Thus, even in the absence of a microscopic
structural order, the thermodynamic model presented here can readily
account for the reasons behind the existence of a fixed composition.
The equilibrium composition can be obtained by minimizing the energy, . While
the Coulomb terms have an explicit
dependence on x, the dependence of other terms such
as Cav is implicit and expected to be
weaker. This none the less enables the determination of the equilibrium
composition. The energy required to produce a site-specific defect
by the addition or removal of one of the participating QDs is then
related to  

The second energy derivative  can be evaluated and
contains the Coulomb
interaction terms as the leading contributors (Supporting Information). This implies that , thereby setting a strong penalty for the
deviation from an optimal composition in the QD assembly.

To
qualitatively illustrate this effect, consider an AX2 solid
as shown in the schematic in Figure 4b. The creation of a single AX-type stoichiometry
defect requires the discharging of an X QD and further the injection
of this charge into the remaining X dot. This implies that defect
creation is associated with a Coulomb charging term of the form  which
is O (1 eV), apart from the penalties
associated with changes in the local structure (Figure 4c).

Conclusions
To conclude, we examined
the mechanistic principles for the formation
of QD assemblies. It is found that QD assemblies formed by charge
transfer between participating dots are adequately explained by equilibrium
thermodynamics. Despite the apparent lack of a crystallographic structure,
QD assemblies show a definite composition in terms of the ratios of
participating QDs. A thermodynamic model that accounts for trends
in assembly formation in QDs as a function of size and structure is
developed. The model accurately explains a change in the assembly
composition from 1:1.26 to 1:0.23 for ZnTe/CdS and Cu:CdS assemblies
with respect to the two QDs. A different trend is observed and explained
in the case of PbSe/CdSe and Cu:CdS QDs. Most unexpectedly, the magnitude
of the onsite Coulomb interactions is identified to be the reason
behind the existence of a fixed composition as opposed to the expected
quantum confinement.

PbSe Magic-Sized Nanocrystals
PbSe magic-sized nanocrystals
(MSNs) were synthesized by following the established procedure.38 Lead oxide [0.1 mmol (mmol), 0.69 g], 9.5 mmol
of oleic acid (5 mL), and ODE (12 mL) were added into a 50 mL round-bottom
(RB) flask, and the mixture was heated to 150 °C under argon
for 1.5 h. Then, the flask was cooled down to RT, and 4 mL of 2 M
TOPSe (tri-octyl phosphine selenide) was injected into the RB flask
at RT. After 4 h, the solution turned brown; this indicates the formation
of PbSe MSNs. Cleaned MSNs are obtained by centrifugation with methanol,
ethanol, and isopropanol. The absorption spectrum of MSCNs is given
in S2 (dark red solid line). Here, 2 M
TOPSe was prepared by dissolving 1.248 g of Se in 8 mL of TOP.

Synthesis
of Lead Selenide/Cadmium Selenide Core/Shell QDs (PbSe/CdSe)
Synthesis of core/shell PbSe/CdSe QDs was done following the established
procedure39 with slight modifications.

PbSe Core
PbO (0.1 mmol, 0.69 g), 0.4 mmol (2 mL) of
oleic acid, and 12 mL of ODE were added to the abovementioned RB flask.
The mixture was degassed and kept in argon atmosphere. Then, the mixture
was heated to 180 °C for 1.5 h with constant stirring. After
1.5 h, 4 mL of 2 M TOPSe was added to the RB flask at 180 °C.
Reaction was immediately quenched by adding 10 mL of toluene once
we achieved the desired size. PbSe QDs were purified by multiple centrifugations
with methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol.

CdSe Shell on the PbSe
Core
PbSe QDs obtained from
the abovementioned step were dispersed in 10 mL of toluene in an RB
flask. About 10 mL of 0.1 mmol cadmium oleate was added, and then
the flask was kept under argon atmosphere at 100 °C for 1 h with
constant stirring. Reaction was quenched by reducing the temperature,
and the PbSe/CdSe QD precipitate was collected by centrifuging with
methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol. The absorption spectra of PbSe/CdSe
QDs (S2a) and the TEM image (S2b) are given in Figure S2. The information regarding size of PbSe-based QDs
used in assembly preparation is given in Table 1 (Supporting Information).

Synthesis of ZnTe/CdS
Synthesis of the ZnTe/CdS core/shell
was done following the previously reported method.19

ZnTe Core
Synthesis of ZnTe Cores
Involving Two Steps
The first
step involves making a reactive telluride ion precursor by treating
0.5 mmol of tellurium with reducing agents such as NaBH4 in this case, with 2 mL of 1,4-butanediol as solvent at 60 °C
under argon atmosphere for 5 min. Then, 0.1 mmol of dextrose was dissolved
in 1 mL 1,4-butanediol which was added to consume excess borohydride.

In the second step, 0.5 mmol (92 mg) of zinc acetate dihydrate
was heated in another flask at 100 °C with 4 mL of ODE and 1
mL of oleylamine. Once the temperature of flask reached 100 °C,
the contents the flask described in step 1 were rapidly injected.

CdS Shell
Cd-oleate and S in oleylamine were added
dropwise into the flask containing the ZnTe core at 230 °C under
argon atmosphere, until the desired shell thickness on the core was
obtained. Aliquots were collected to obtain the desired shell thickness.
The graph showing absorption spectra of ZnTe/CdS QDs is given in the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

Synthesis of
Cu-Doped Cadmium Sulphide (Cu:CdS)
Synthesis
of Cu:CdS QDs was done following a procedure reported in the literature.40 Copper chloride dihydrate (3 mg) and 0.1 mmol
of sulfur (3.2 mg) were added to 0.1 mmol of cadmium myristate with
3 mL of ODE, and then reaction mixture was heated up to 230 °C
under argon atmosphere. Once the temperature reached 230 °C,
1 mL of oleylamine was injected dropwise into the reaction mixture.
Around 1.19% of doping was observed in all our cases. Immediately,
the reaction was quenched by removing the heating mantle. Cu:CdS QDs
were collected by centrifuging with methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol.
The absorption and photoluminescence spectra of cleaned Cu:CdS are
given in the Supporting Information (Figure
S4).

Synthesis of Cu-Doped ZnSe/CdSe (Cu:ZnSe/CdSe)
Cu–ZnSe/CdSe
QDs were synthesized by a procedure reported in the literature.41

Zinc acetate (0.1 mmol), 4 mL of ODE,
1 mL of oleylamine, and 3 mg of CuCl2 were added to a three-necked
RB flask and heated to 180 °C under argon atmosphere for 2 min.
About 0.5 mL of 0.1 mmol TOPSe was injected rapidly into the flask
at 180 °C for nucleation. For growth, 1.5 mL of 0.1 mmol TOPSe was injected dropwise at 180
°C, and about 0.2 mL of 0.1 mmol Cd-oleate was injected. The
resultant Cu:ZnSe/CdSe QDs were collected and purified.

The
absorption and photoluminescence spectrum of cleaned Cu:ZnSe/CdSe
is given in the Supporting Information (Figure
S5).

Synthesis of QD Assemblies
Synthesis of QD assemblies
was done by following a previously reported method.20 Formation of QD assemblies involves reaction between two
different QDs: one is X (X = Cu:CdS) and the other is A or B (A =
ZnTe/CdS B = PbSe/CdSe).

A known amount of QD X and QD A or
QD B was dispersed separately in 0.5 mL hexane each. After that, QD
X is mixed with QD A or B and allowed to dry completely. After complete
evaporation of hexane in the mixture, about 0.5 mL of hexane was again
added and kept for evaporation. The addition of solvent and evaporation
of the solvent was repeated 5 times. This process increases the number
of collisions between the dots in the mixture. Electrons are transferred
between QDs during QD–QD collisions. As a result, X gains a
negative charge, and QD A or B acquires a positive charge, setting
up a Columbic force of attraction between them. Because of the Columbic
force of attraction, bound QDs precipitate from solution, giving rise
to assemblies. The assembly precipitate was separated from unreacted
QDs by centrifugation. The precipitate was washed thoroughly with
hexane to eliminate unbound QDs. This purified assembly is used for
further analysis. The same procedure is carried out for all the sizes
of QD A and QD B. TEM and high-resolution TEM images of various QD
assemblies are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).
