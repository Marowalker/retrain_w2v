This work reports highly selective
phosphopeptide enrichment using
amorphous TiO2 nanotubes (TiO2NTs) and the same
material decorated with superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs).
TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs materials were applied for phosphopeptide enrichment both from
a simple peptide mixture (tryptic digest of bovine serum albumin and
α-casein) and from a complex peptide mixture (tryptic digest
of Jurkat T cell lysate). The obtained enrichment efficiency and selectivity
for phosphopeptides of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs were increased to 28.7 and 25.3%, respectively,
as compared to those of the well-established TiO2 microspheres.
The enrichment protocol was extended for a second elution step facilitating
the identification of additional phosphopeptides. It further turned
out that both types of amorphous TiO2 nanotubes provide
qualitatively new physicochemical features that are clearly advantageous
for highly selective phosphopeptide enrichment. This has been confirmed
experimentally resulting in substantial reduction of non-phosphorylated
peptides in the enriched samples. In addition, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs combine high selectivity and ease of handling
due to the superparamagnetic character of the material. The presented
materials and performances are further promising for applications
toward a whole range of other types of biomolecules to be treated
in a similar fashion.

==== Body
Introduction
Nanomaterials undoubtedly
represent the most investigated group
of materials. Many nanomaterials have already found major applications
in life science and biomedical devices. In particular, functionalized
nano/microstructures are not only widely used in biomedical and biochemical
research but also gradually becoming an integral part of many diagnostic
or therapeutic tools used in clinical practice.1,2 Some
of these materials have been fully exploited in the analysis of biological
samples, especially for ultrahigh-throughput and parallel analysis
at single-molecule levels. For example, in proteomics, nanomaterials
are applied in the preanalytical enrichment phase combined with subsequent
analysis of posttranslational modifications of proteins/peptides.3

Phosphorylation is a reversible covalent
modification of proteins/peptides
through which the protein/peptide function is regulated in response
to extracellular stimuli.4 Because phosphate
groups carry highly negative charges, the phosphorylation of a protein
can substantially change its conformation, which further affects the
biological function, stability, and/or localization of the protein
as well as its interaction with other proteins.5 One of the major goals in phosphoproteomics, the field
that studies the dynamic changes of phosphoproteins over time, is
to identify and describe the relationship of the phosphorylation regulation
with the mechanism and pathogenesis of many serious diseases.6−8

The analysis of phosphopeptides by mass spectrometry has many
pitfalls
that often distort the results and even lead to wrong conclusions.
The low abundance of phosphopeptides, their low ionization efficiency,
the labile phosphate moiety, and the interference of non-phosphorylated
peptides strongly limit the comprehensive characterization of protein
phosphorylation using mass spectrometry.9−11 These problems are often
addressed by a three-step approach: (i) enrichment of phosphopeptides
and (ii) fractionation of phosphopeptides by liquid chromatography,
which is then (iii) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS).12 Over the past years, many approaches, including
the commonly used immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)13,14 and metal oxide affinity chromatography (MOAC),15−17 have been developed
in order to specifically enrich phosphopeptides before their analysis
by LC–MS/MS. The principle of the phosphopeptide enrichment
by IMAC is based on the high affinity of the negatively charged and
hydrophilic phosphate group to metal ions (e.g., Fe3+ and
Ga3+) immobilized on a chelating iminodiacetic or nitrilotriacetic
acid. Although this method is selective and generally sensitive enough,
it still suffers from a lower affinity for some phosphopeptides and
is too susceptible to sample contaminants, for example, nucleic acids.14 In addition, the non-specific adsorption of
acidic peptides and peptides containing histidine may reduce the specificity
of phosphopeptide enrichment.18 While conventional
immobilized metal ions in IMAC are mainly trivalent (Fe3+/Al3+/Ga3+), tetravalent IMAC utilizes Zr4+/Ti4+/Ce4+ ions and commonly a phosphonate
binding chemistry.19−21 Like the TiO2-based one, Ti4+–phosphonate IMAC has a high tolerance toward acidic buffers
to allow the enrichment of more basic phosphopeptides.22 Nevertheless, IMAC utilizing Ti4+ has lower affinity toward the multiply phosphorylated peptides,
as compared to conventional Fe3+-IMAC enrichment.23

In the enrichment of phosphopeptides by
metal oxides, the specificity
has been substantially improved by introducing hydroxy acids such
as 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB),15 glutamic
acid,24 or lactic acid25 in the loading and washing buffer. Since the introduction
of effective phosphopeptide enrichment using DHB as the excluder for
TiO2 microspheres,15 many metal
oxides have been successfully applied in the enrichment of phosphopeptides,
either as metal oxides (ZrO2, Fe3O4, Al2O3, SnO2, HfO2,
or CeO2)26−31 or composite materials (e.g., TiO2–ZrO2 and CeO2–ZrO2 composites).32,33 The review of Wang et al.3 provides a
well-organized summary of materials developed and applied for phosphorylated
protein/peptide enrichment. Despite this progress, however, the development
of metal oxide-based affinity materials for the specific enrichment
of phosphopeptides is still an ongoing process. Some of the reported
studies only tested simple model mixtures of defined proteins rather
than real complex samples like cell lysates.3,32−34 Therefore, it is necessary to acquire suitable materials
and to design a protocol that could effectively treat also the real
complex peptide mixtures often analyzed in various biological studies.

A very promising example of material that could be very effective
for the purification represents self-organized TiO2 nanotubes
prepared by anodization of titanium. These nanotubes possess many
intriguing properties, such as their unique 1D structure, tunability
of dimensions, stability, biocompatibility, and easy preparation.35,36 Consequently, they have been applied in many different bioapplications
for the photocatalytic killing of cancer cells,37 drug delivery,38 biosensing,39 protein adsorption and separation,40,41 and His-tagged protein purification.42 Surprisingly, the potential of TiO2 nanotubes for phosphopeptide
enrichment was only noticed recently, starting with the introduction
of tunable TiO2 nanotube arrays either directly incorporated
into the microchip for on-chip enrichment of serum phosphopeptides43 or nanotubes grown on a titanium wire.44 The materials can be further made magnetically
active by utilizing the superparamagnetic properties of magnetic components
(e.g., Fe3O4, γ-Fe2O3).42,45 Consequently, these composite materials
can be rapidly isolated with an external magnetic field and easily
dispersed, greatly facilitating the separation procedure by reducing
the loss of affinity materials and biological samples, factors that
directly impact the enrichment efficiency.3 Magnetic affinity composites are usually core–shell structures
where the magnetic core does not interact with the surrounding environment.
Anodic TiO2 nanotubes decorated by Fe3O4 nanoparticles represent an interesting composite material
that can be easily manipulated using an external magnetic field and
possesses unique features usable for various bioapplications. We have
recently shown that this material can be directly engaged in affinity
interactions for the isolation of His-tagged recombinant proteins.42 However, this material has great potential for
the treatment of other biomolecules, which is demonstrated in the
presented study in the case of phosphopeptides.

In this work,
we introduce amorphous TiO2 nanotubes
(TiO2NTs) and amorphous TiO2 nanotubes decorated
with superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs) as innovative materials
for the enrichment of phosphopeptides. The tryptic digests of standard
proteins as well as of highly complex cell lysates were utilized for
the demonstration of phosphopeptide enrichment performance of the
TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs materials. In addition, we developed a two-step sequential elution
procedure resulting in an increased number of the detected phosphopeptides
for all tested materials.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs
TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs materials were prepared as described
in our previous work.42 Commercially available
TiO2 microspheres with a nominal diameter of 10 μm
(Titansphere, GL Sciences) were used as a reference. Morphological
characterizations of materials were performed using a field emission
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) system (JSM 7500F, JEOL Ltd.).
The structure of the samples was analyzed by diffraction analyses
using an X-ray diffractometer (Empyrean, Panalytical) with Cu Kα
radiation. The specific surface area and the pore size distribution
of TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 microspheres were determined according to
the N2 adsorption isotherms. Measurements of adsorption
isotherms of nitrogen (purity, 99.999 vol %) were carried out using
an ASAP 2020 and evaluated using the MicroActive software (Micromeritics,
USA). Specific surface areas were calculated from nitrogen adsorption
isotherms using the BET approach.46 Pore
size distributions were determined by means of the BJH method47 using the Harkins–Jura equation to calculate
the adsorbed layer thickness.48

Preparation
of Model Phosphopeptide Mixtures
Tryptically
digested phosphoprotein α-casein and bovine serum albumin were
used as a simple model peptide mixture. Both proteins were resuspended
in 50 mM NH4HCO3. A given amount of dithiothreitol
(DTT) was added to reach the final concentration of 20 mM, and the
solution was incubated for 30 min at 56 °C. Then, iodoacetamide
(IAA) was added to the final concentration of 40 mM, and the solution
was incubated for 30 min protected from light at RT. Alkylation was
quenched by raising the DTT concentration to 40 mM. The protein was
digested with sequencing-grade modified trypsin (Promega, USA) at
37 °C overnight using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:50 (w/w).

For the preparation of the complex peptide mixture, Jurkat T cells
were cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum
(FBS, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at 37 °C/5% CO2 and passaged
every 2 or 3 days. The harvested cells were first treated with 1 mM
pervanadate for 10 min at 37 °C (3.5 × 107 cells/mL),49 then resuspended in an ice-cold hypotonic lysis
buffer (10 mM Tris at pH 7.5 and 0.5 mM MgCl2), and lysed
using a glass Dounce homogenizer with a tight pestle (20 strokes).
The protein concentration in the lysate was measured using a Micro
BCA kit (Thermo Pierce, USA). The proteins were reduced by the addition
of DTT (final concentration, 10 mM) and left for 1 h at 37 °C
followed by alkylation with IAA (final concentration 20 mM) for 30
min at RT in the dark. An excess of IAA was quenched by the addition
of DTT to the final concentration of 20 mM, and the reaction mixture
was left for 15 min at RT. The proteins were digested by TCPK-treated
trypsin from bovine pancreas (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) at an enzyme/substrate
ratio of 1:50 (w/w) at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were desalted
on Discovery DSC-18 SPE cartridges (500 mg/3 mL, Sigma-Aldrich, USA),
eluted with 80% acetonitrile (ACN)/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
and vacuum-dried.

Phosphopeptide Enrichment
Phosphopeptide
enrichment
was performed with either TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, or commercial TiO2 microspheres.
Phosphopeptide enrichment was carried out for both simple and complex
peptide mixtures following the previously reported protocols25,50,51 and extended for the second elution
step in order to obtain higher phosphoproteome coverage. To optimize
the binding and elution conditions, tryptically digested α-casein
(20 pmol) and bovine serum albumin (BSA, 200 pmol) were used as a
simple model mixture, and the resulting protocol was performed also
for the complex peptide mixture. The complex peptide mixture was enriched
in duplicate, and each elution fraction was measured twice by nanoLC–MS/MS.
Each material (3 mg of TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, or TiO2 microspheres) was dispersed
separately in 80% ACN/0.1% TFA (v/v) in Eppendorf tubes and washed
with 80% ACN/5% TFA (v/v) containing 1 M lactic acid. Dried tryptically
digested whole cell lysates of Jurkat T cells (500 μg) were
reconstituted in a loading buffer of 80% ACN/5% TFA (v/v) containing
1 M lactic acid, loaded onto the washed material for 30 min, and the
supernatant was saved for a further re-enrichment step. Each material
was then sequentially washed twice with 80% ACN/5% TFA (v/v) containing
1 M lactic acid, twice with 80% ACN/5% TFA (v/v), and once with 20%
ACN/0.5% TFA (v/v). Phosphopeptides were eluted from the material
using 1% NH4OH (first elution step) followed by elution
with 3% NH4OH/45% ACN (v/v) containing 50 mM (NH4)2HPO4 (second elution step). Supernatant fractions
from TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs saved after the loading step were re-enriched using 3
mg of TiO2 microspheres with the same protocol utilized
for the raw lysate digest enrichment. The pH of all the elution fractions
was reduced to 2–3 with 20% TFA. Prior to nanoLC–MS
analysis, the elution fractions were desalted using custom-made reversed-phase
microcolumns (length, 10 mm; ID, 250 μm) packed with 2.6 μm
Kinetex EVO C18 resin (Phenomenex, USA) in FEP (fluorinated ethylene
propylene) tubing (VICI AG, Switzerland) blocked with a small piece
of Whatman glass microfiber filter (GE Healthcare, USA). Samples eluted
with a non-linear gradient with gradually increasing ACN content (2–40%
ACN/0.1% TFA) from the desalting microcolumns were dried using a vacuum
concentrator (Eppendorf, Germany) and frozen.52,53

Mass Spectrometric Analysis
Mass spectrometric analysis
of the simple mixture following enrichment was performed on the MALDI
LTQ Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA)
with DHB solution (10 g L–1 in 50% ACN/0.1% TFA)
with 1% H3PO4 as a matrix.15 Data were acquired in positive mode with full MS scan (800–4000 m/z) at 60,000 FWHM.

Peptides from
the complex mixtures were first dissolved in 20 μL of 2% ACN/0.1%
TFA, and 1 μL was analyzed using an UltiMate 3000 HPLC system
(Dionex, USA) including a μ-Precolumn (300 μm × 5
mm, C18PepMap 5 μm 100 Å particles; Dionex,
USA) connected to an analytical NanoEase column (100 μm ×
150 mm, Atlantis C18 3 μm 100 Å particles; Waters,
USA). The separation was performed with a bilinear gradient of 5–45%
ACN/0.1% TFA over 81 min under a flow rate of 360 nL min–1 and UV detection set to 215 nm. The separation of peptides for nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis was done using the UltiMate 3000 RSLC-nano HPLC system (Dionex,
USA) with a trap column (75 μm × 20 mm) packed with 3 μm
Acclaim PepMap100 C18 particles and a separation column (75 μm
× 150 mm) packed with 2 μm Acclaim PepMap RSLC C18 particles.
The separation was performed with a dual linear gradient using 3–44%
ACN over 89 min under a flow rate of 300 nL min–1 and analyzed with a Q Exactive system (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) in positive mode with full MS scan (350–1650 m/z) at 70,000 FWHM and with the top 12 precursors
in MS/MS at 17,500 FWHM. Proteome Discoverer software (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, USA, version 2.2.0.388) connected to the Mascot searching
engine (version 2.4.1) was used for identification of MS/MS spectra.
The parameters for Mascot database searching were as follows: instrument,
ESI-QUAD-TOF; protein database, UniProt human reference proteome UP000005640
(July 5, 2018); enzyme, trypsin; maximum missed cleavage sites, 2;
taxonomy, all entries; precursor mass tolerance, 15 ppm; fragment
mass tolerance, 20 mmu; static modification, carbamidomethyl (C);
dynamic modifications – oxidation (M), acetyl (protein N-term),
Gln- > pyro-Glu (N-term Q), Glu- > pyro-Glu (N-term E), pyro-carbamidomethyl
(N-term C), phospho (ST), phospho (Y).

The statistical language
R (version 3.5.0)54 with RStudio interface
(version 1.1.447) and pre-programmed Excel
(Microsoft, USA) worksheets were used for processing the results exported
from Proteome Discoverer software. The MS proteomics data were deposited
to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository
with the dataset identifier PXD012749 (DOI: 10.6019/PXD012749).

Results and Discussion
TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 Microspheres for Phosphopeptide
Enrichment
One of the developed materials, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, was recently described and characterized
by SEM,
STEM, and magnetic measurements in our previous work.42 In this work, TiO2 nanotubes without Fe3O4 nanoparticle loading (noted as TiO2NTs) were also employed for the evaluation of phosphopeptide enrichment
capabilities. For the characterization of the materials, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), specific surface area measurements, and SEM analyses were performed. Figure 1a,b shows SEM images
of TiO2 microspheres as the reference material for phosphopeptide
enrichment, and Figure 1c,d shows SEM images of the as-prepared amorphous TiO2NTs with an internal diameter of ∼230 nm at two different
magnifications. In the next step, the TiO2NTs were homogeneously
decorated with magnetite nanoparticles to yield TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs. Figure 1e,f confirms the presence of a homogeneous decoration
of TiO2NTs with magnetite nanoparticles, and this material
was further used as a superparamagnetic material for phosphopeptide
enrichment utilizing also the interactions of phosphopeptides with
Fe3O4 nanoparticles on the surface of the composite
TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP material.

Figure 1 SEM images
of (a, b) TiO2 microspheres, (c, d) TiO2NT layers,
and (e, f) TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP layers
at different magnifications.

To analyze the crystalline structure of tested materials,
X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analyses have been performed (Figure S-1). XRD patterns revealed that both types of TiO2NTs remained amorphous after drying at 60 °C for 4 h
and that commercial TiO2 microspheres possess a tetragonal
anatase crystalline structure.

The characterization of specific
surface area (SBET)
using nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of all three materials
showed a substantial difference between both types of TiO2NTs and the TiO2 microspheres. The TiO2 microspheres
have a mesoporous structure, and SBET was determined to
be 127.5 ± 0.8 m2 g–1. This is a
>5-fold higher value as compared to that of TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs for which SBET was determined
to be 24.2 ± 0.3 m2 g–1 and ∼8.5
times higher than that for TiO2NTs with 15.3 ± 0.2
m2 g–1. No porosity in the micro- and/or
mesoporous range was observed for any TiO2NT sample. According
to the differences in the surface area of the materials, the maximum
capacity for binding of phosphopeptides to TiO2NTs and
TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs was assumed to be
lower, and thus the enrichment efficiency was further compared for
all three materials.

Workflow and Principles of Phosphopeptide
Enrichment
According to the literature, TiO2 and
Fe3O4 are capable of selective interaction with
phosphopeptides;15,55 our TiO2NTs consist
of amorphous TiO2, and
they are strongly hydroxylated on the surface. Two additional interesting
specific features are combined within TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs: the unique morphology of strongly hydroxylated
amorphous nanotubes along with the superparamagnetic property of the
particles. Therefore, both materials should be capable of phosphopeptide
adsorption and their enrichment from peptide mixtures. To verify that,
two different samples were used to test the phosphopeptide enrichment
by the TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP materials: the simple peptide mixture containing digests
of BSA and α-casein and the complex peptide mixture derived
from whole cell lysates of Jurkat T cells. The overall enrichment
performance of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP materials was also compared to the well-established
phosphopeptide enrichment using TiO2 microspheres.

Figure 2 schematically
depicts the experimental workflow for the phosphopeptide enrichment
using either TiO2NTs or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 2a) and TiO2 microspheres as a reference (Figure 2b). The same separation
conditions for the enrichment and effective isolation of singly and
multiply phosphorylated peptides were essentially used for all three
materials. To estimate the efficiency of phosphopeptide enrichment,
the TiO2 microspheres were also used for the re-enrichment
of supernatant fractions resulting from enrichment of the complex
peptide mixture with TiO2NTs or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs. The second (additional) elution step was
included in the protocol directly after the first elution step in
order to obtain the phosphopeptides remaining on the material. The
enrichment of the simple peptide mixture was assessed by MALDI-MS
analysis, while for the complex peptide mixture, the nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis was used. Separation of the TiO2NTs and the TiO2 microspheres from the liquid phase was done by centrifugation
at 3000g, whereas TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs were quickly and easily separated using a Nd magnet.
The magnetic features of the TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs allow faster and easier handling that is especially useful
in parallel processing of several samples. Furthermore, the liquid–solid
separation is more quantitative for the TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs due to the low liquid retention in the test
tube within replacement of individual solutions, which reduces the
liquid carryover to the following steps.

of the phosphopeptide enrichment workflow
applied in this study using (a) TiO2NTs or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs and (b) TiO2 microspheres.
Aliquots of tryptic digests of both standard proteins and complex
cell lysates were used for the direct comparison of tested material.

Enrichment of Phosphopeptides
from the Simple Peptide Mixture
To preliminarily evaluate
the phosphopeptide enrichment ability
of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, the standard simple peptide mixture containing tryptic digests
of α-casein and BSA in a molar ratio of 1:10 was utilized. Phosphopeptides
originating from α-casein were enriched using the protocol described
schematically in Figure 2a. The obtained (phospho)peptide mixture was directly analyzed using
a MALDI-Orbitrap MS. The MALDI spectrum of the original peptide mixture
(Figure 3a) contains
almost no apparent signal of phosphopeptides, while the first eluents
from the sample enriched with either TiO2NTs (Figure 3b), TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 3d), or TiO2 microspheres (Figure 3f) contain intensive
signals of phosphopeptides. This confirms the ability of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs to enrich
phosphopeptides from peptide mixtures in a similar way as is usually
done with TiO2 microspheres. The amount of non-phosphorylated
peptides observed in the first elution fraction is comparable for
both TiO2NTs or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 3b,d) and TiO2 microspheres (Figure 3f). The second elution fraction from TiO2 microspheres (Figure 3g) contained a slightly higher abundance of non-specifically
bound peptides (mainly in the range of m/z 700–1100) as compared to the second elution fraction
from TiO2NTs (Figure 3c) or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs (Figure 3e). Furthermore,
the second elution fractions of all three materials (Figure 3c,e,g) showed a relative increase
in signal abundance of multiply phosphorylated peptides. These differences
between the first and the second elution fractions may be explained
by the improved elution characteristics of the 3% NH4OH/45%
ACN (v/v) solution containing 50 mM (NH4)2HPO4. This led us to further evaluate whether the second elution
step could be possibly helpful in the analysis of multiply phosphorylated
peptides. This might be important, for example, in studies focused
on the analysis of hyperphosphorylated proteins related to certain
pathology states.7,8

after enrichment with TiO2 microspheres. Phosphopeptides
are marked with the number of phosphates (P). Oxidized forms of marked
phosphopeptides and in-source loss of phosphate groups from this phosphopeptides
are not highlighted in the spectra to keep the figure simple.

Enrichment of Phosphopeptides
from the Complex Peptide Mixture
In common real samples used
for phosphopeptide profiling (cell
lysates, extracellular matrix, tissue extracts, etc.), the phosphorylation
modification often appears with a very low stoichiometry, which makes
the phosphorylation analysis very difficult. Therefore, these samples
need highly selective and specific methods for phosphopeptide isolation
in order to analyze the phosphopeptides successfully. Such methods
should include both optimized sample processing conditions and suitable
materials capable of handling the overwhelming sample complexity toward
efficient phosphopeptide isolation. In this study, TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs were also
tested for phosphopeptide isolation from the complex peptide mixture
obtained as a tryptic digest of the whole cell lysate of Jurkat T
cells treated with Na3VO4/H2O2.

For all materials, two enrichment replicates were
analyzed, and nanoLC–MS/MS measurement of each replicate was
performed in duplicate. Only peptides identified in both enrichment
replicates and at least in one of two technical replicates with high
confidence (1% FDR) were considered into the evaluation. Figure 4a shows a Venn diagram
summarizing the number of phosphopeptides identified in the first
elution fractions after phosphopeptide enrichment with TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, or TiO2 microspheres. As can be seen, the majority of the identified
phosphopeptides are identical for all three materials. This shows
a similar performance of all three tested materials. Nevertheless,
from the number of uniquely identified phosphopeptides for particular
materials, it is obvious that the materials are partially complementary
in the phosphopeptide coverage and that the use of more different
materials for phosphopeptide enrichment can be beneficial to a deeper
phosphopeptide analysis of the sample. Although it is known that the
number of identified phosphopeptides can be increased by multiple
sample injections in LC–MS analysis (22.1 and 22.7% more phosphopeptides
for two sample injections of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP phosphopeptide isolates, respectively),
the substitution of a second sample injection in the case of both
nanotube-based materials by injection of a phosphopeptide sample obtained
with TiO2 microspheres led to a slightly increased phosphopeptide
identification rate (27.9 and 36.1% for TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, respectively).

and (b) column diagram with total numbers of identified phosphorylated
and non-phosphorylated peptides.

Figure 4b
provides
a summary overview of all identified phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated
peptides in the first elution fraction for all materials. The total
number of identified phosphopeptides was similar for both TiO2NTs and TiO2 microspheres (2604 and 2595, respectively),
and it was slightly lower for TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs (2353, i.e., ∼9.3% less phosphopeptides as compared
to TiO2 microspheres). However, a significant difference
appeared between nanotube-based materials and TiO2 microspheres
in the number of identified non-phosphorylated peptides in the first
elution fractions. Here, TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP materials showed a significantly lower proportion
of non-phosphorylated peptides in all identified peptides (505 out
of 3019, 16.2%, and 575 out of 2928, 19.6%, respectively), as compared
to TiO2 microspheres (2118 out of 4713, 44.9%). This clearly
shows a significantly improved selectivity of TiO2NTs and
TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP materials compared
to the TiO2 microspheres for the phosphopeptide enrichment.
The decrease of non-phosphorylated peptides in elution fractions has
a positive impact on the enriched sample purity obtained mainly from
highly complex samples containing phosphopeptides in low abundance.
Increased non-specific sorption of non-phosphorylated peptides on
TiO2 microspheres was also obvious from nanoLC analysis
with UV detection where a significantly higher UV response for the
first elution fractions from TiO2 microspheres was observed
(Figure S-2). The improved selectivity
of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs is presumably caused by the corresponding material’s composition,
its structure, or non-crystallinity affecting its interaction with
the peptides. Although the capacity of the nanotube-based materials
for phosphopeptide enrichment proves to be comparable with TiO2 microspheres under the used experimental conditions, further
optimization of TiO2NTs or TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs is possible for an increased number of identified
peptides while maintaining the superior material selectivity. This
optimization includes in particular tailoring the aspect ratio of
the nanotubes (i.e., the ratio between the tube length and inner diameter)
and the surface hydroxylation.

Two-Step Phosphopeptide
Elution and Analysis of Multiply Phosphorylated
Peptides
MOAC phosphopeptide enrichment based on the use
of TiO2 is popular for its simplicity and relatively high
specificity. However, multiply phosphorylated peptides are usually
observed to a lower extent in the TiO2-enriched peptide
mixtures as compared to, for example, IMAC phosphopeptide enrichment.
One assumption is that certain (especially multiply) phosphorylated
peptides may not be eluted under standard elution conditions from
TiO2-based materials.50 To address
this point, an easy second elution step in addition to the standard
phosphopeptide elution with ammonia solution was introduced to the
enrichment protocol in this work. The composition of the second elution
solution was given by an increased concentration of ammonia (3 vs
1% NH4OH), the introduction of ACN (45%, v/v) to diminish
the non-specific sorption of peptides on the material, and the addition
of phosphate salt (50 mM (NH4)2HPO4) for an increased competitive elution of phosphopeptides. This simple
additional step follows the first elution step, and thus it does not
have any effect on the results obtained with the standard elution
procedure. The processing of the second eluent is almost the same
as for the first with the exception of the vacuum drying step, included
prior to the reversed-phase-based sample clean-up for the following
nanoLC–MS/MS analysis.

The first test with the simple
mixture of two standard proteins suggested that the relative abundance
of multiply phosphorylated peptides may increase in the second elution
fraction (Figure 3c,e,g).
To verify these observations, the second elution step was also included
in the analysis of complex peptide mixtures derived from Jurkat T
cells for the compared materials. The UV records from nanoLC analysis
for TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 microspheres (Figure S-3–S-5, respectively) confirm that the total peptide
amount is significantly lower than that obtained in the first elution
step. However, the following nanoLC-MS/MS analysis still identified
a significant amount of phosphopeptides also in the second elution
fractions (1785, 1188, and 1633 for TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 microspheres,
respectively; Figure 5a). The vast majority of these identified phosphopeptides were also
found in the nanoLC-MS/MS analysis of the first elution fraction as
shown in the Venn diagrams in Figure 5b. Nevertheless, when compared to the number of phosphopeptides
identified in the first elution fraction, 216, 204, and 265 phosphopeptides
were newly identified for TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 microspheres comprising
an increase of 8.3, 8.7, and 10.2% in the overall phosphopeptide coverage,
respectively.

from the raw lysate digest enrichment using TiO2NTs, TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, and TiO2 microspheres.
(a) Column diagram with total numbers of identified phosphopeptides
and (b) Venn diagrams with intersections of both elution steps.

The obtained data for all materials
and both elution fractions
were also evaluated according to the number of phosphate groups on
the peptide backbone present in identified phosphopeptides, and the
summary is presented in the Table 1. From this point, all three materials are comparable
with a slightly lower performance of TiO2NTs, whereas TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs show the highest ratio
of multiply phosphorylated peptides toward singly phosphorylated ones.
The hypothesis about the increased presence of multiply phosphorylated
peptides in the second elution fraction was partially confirmed for
TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs where the relative
ratio of multiply phosphorylated peptides was the highest among the
materials and even increased in the second elution fraction.

Re-enrichment
of Supernatant Fractions with TiO2 Microspheres
To further characterize the phosphopeptide enrichment capabilities
of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, the supernatant fraction from the complex peptide mixture enrichment
with nanotube-based materials was re-enriched using TiO2 microspheres. The aim was to determine the level of effectiveness
of phosphopeptide capture of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs and to test whether these materials
are applicable to the enrichment of typical complex peptide mixtures
originating from biological experiments. The results of these experiments
are summarized in Figure S-6, which compares
identified phosphopeptides and non-phosphorylated peptides both in
the first elution fraction of raw lysate enrichment and in the first
elution from the supernatant re-enrichment.

NanoLC reversed-phase
analysis with UV detection showed a higher amount of peptides present
in the elution fraction from the supernatant re-enrichment as compared
to the first and second elution fractions from the raw lysate enrichment
(Figures S-3 and S-4). The following nanoLC-MS/MS
analysis revealed that the supernatant fractions contained a lower
number of identified phosphopeptides (905 and 1188 for TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs, respectively),
whereas many of them (85.0 and 73.6%, respectively) have already been
identified in the first elution fraction from the raw lysate enrichment.
On the other hand, the re-enrichment of supernatant fractions originating
from TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs using commercial TiO2 microspheres led to the
identification of other 136 and 194 phosphopeptides not identified
previously in the first elution fraction from the raw lysate enrichment.
These results show that the phosphopeptide enrichment using nanotube-based
materials is very effective even though the results confirmed partial
orthogonality between the TiO2 microspheres, nanotube-based
materials TiO2NTs, and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs. This phenomenon has already been observed in the
comparison with the identified phosphopeptides in the first elution
fractions after raw lysate enrichment for all materials (Figure 4a). Then, this partial
alternative selectivity can be also used in the re-enrichment of supernatant
fractions in order to obtain higher phosphoproteome coverage of the
analyzed sample although it is more laborious than the approach with
the second elution step described in the previous section.

The
results of the supernatant fraction re-enrichment show that
the presumption of significantly lower capacity of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs was not
true for these materials, sample amount, and conditions used in the
enrichment protocol. The lower capacity was presumed based on specific
surface area analysis showing the 8.5-fold and 5.3-fold lower surface
area by material weight for TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs as compared to TiO2 microspheres, respectively. Furthermore, in the re-enriched supernatant
fractions obtained using TiO2 microspheres, an ∼8-fold
higher amount of non-phosphorylated peptides was observed as compared
with raw lysate enrichment (Figure S-6c). This is in line with the results presented in Figure 4 that show a lower selectivity
of TiO2 microspheres as related to nanotube-based materials,
and it confirms the importance of selectivity in phosphopeptide enrichment
for this type of sample. Obviously, the samples enriched with materials
with a higher level of non-specific sorption (e.g., TiO2 microspheres in this case) will result in an increased content of
non-phosphorylated peptides in the elution fractions, further leading
to the signal suppression of phosphopeptides in the MS analysis.

TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs differ from the commonly used crystalline TiO2 microspheres
in several aspects, which may be responsible for their different selectivities.
In other studies with similar protocols for enrichment of phosphopeptides
from complex mixtures, the overall selectivity of commercial crystalline
TiO2 microspheres was found to be ∼70.1% when DHB
was used as an excluder56 and 72.2% in
the case of lactic acid, which served also for exclusion of non-phosphorylated
peptides.57 These numbers are higher than
those observed for TiO2 microspheres in this work (55.1%);
however, both studies used diverse initial samples, a different sample-to-microsphere
ratio, and a two-dimensional LC MS setup. Apart from crystalline microspheres,
phosphopeptides can directly interact with the presented nanotubular
materials not only via the available amorphous TiO2 surface
of nanotubes but also in the case of TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs through the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
attached on the nanotube TiO2 walls. The binding characteristic
of TiO2 is described mainly as bidentate coordination of
hydroxyl groups to positively polarized Ti(IV), which is responsible
for the preferential capture and enrichment of phosphopeptides.58,59 In the IMAC technology, Ti4+ ions are utilized for phosphopeptide
enrichment as well as Fe3+ ions.19 As part of the SIMAC protocol, the Fe3+ IMAC technology
is also responsible for the improved enriching of the multiply phosphorylated
peptides.50 Moreover, bare Fe3O4 nanoparticles55 and Fe3O4 nanoparticles incorporated in a polymer-based
monolithic column60 were previously utilized
for the phosphopeptide enrichment. Compared to polymer compounds,
inorganic supports, such as TiO2, may be beneficial due
to their stability in organic solvents (e.g., acetonitrile).42 TiO2 as a support is even more useful
since it can also enrich the phosphopeptides. Compared to other primarily
crystalline materials available today, TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs possess an amorphous structure
with a high number of hydroxyl groups on the surface responsible for
very good hydrophilicity of the material and easy wetting of nanotube
interiors.61

TiO2-based
nanotubes have already been described for
phosphopeptide enrichment previously.43,44 However, the
nanotubes presented by Wijeratne et al. differ in their crystalline
structure because they were annealed and produced in the form of anatase,
and therefore the efficacy of phosphopeptide enrichment was similar
to commercial TiO2 microspheres.44 The inner nanotube diameter was also narrower, ∼110 and ∼45
nm.43,44 The inner diameter is important for accessibility
of nanotube interiors to phosphopeptides; thus, the wider inner diameter
(∼230 nm) of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs and their amorphous character may be crucial
for the phosphopeptide enrichment efficiency. On the other hand, the
increased tube diameter means a lower surface/volume ratio and surface/weight
ratio.

Conclusions
This paper reports the
successful application of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NP materials
for phosphopeptide enrichment preferably suitable for complex biological
samples. In addition, the improved enrichment protocol including a
second elution step for more extensive identification of phosphopeptides
is presented. By comparison of TiO2NTs and TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs along with a reference material
based on TiO2 microspheres, it can be concluded that the
amorphous TiO2 nanotubular surface and the superparamagnetic
version decorated with the Fe3O4 nanoparticles
specifically interact with phosphopeptides. The performance of presented
materials was comparable with well-established commercial TiO2 microspheres although these possess a several times higher
surface area by material weight. Our results unambiguously confirmed
that the main difference between nanotube-based materials and TiO2 microspheres lies in a different proportion of the non-specific
sorption. The amorphous character of TiO2 nanotubes results
in a significantly improved selectivity for phosphopeptide isolation
and to an increased ratio of phosphopeptides to peptides in the enriched
sample. Substantially improved selectivity of TiO2NTs and
TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs for phosphopeptides
is observed in the reduction of non-specific sorption of non-phosphorylated
biomolecules, and the suppression of phosphopeptide signal within
nanoLC-MS analysis is thus diminished. Furthermore, in the analysis
of complex cell lysate digests, the introduction of the second elution
step enhanced the overall phosphoproteome coverage in the sample.
Finally, the added superparamagnetic properties of the TiO2NTs@Fe3O4NPs are also important for the simplified
sample handling during phosphopeptide enrichment.
