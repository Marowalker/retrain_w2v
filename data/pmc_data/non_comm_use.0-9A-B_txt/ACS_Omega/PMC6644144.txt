Boronic
acids have found widespread use in the field of biomaterials,
primarily through their ability to bind with biologically relevant
1,2- and 1,3-diols, including saccharides and peptidoglycans, or with
polyols to prepare hydrogels with dynamic covalent or responsive behavior.
Despite a wide range of boronic acid architectures that have been
previously considered, there is a need for greater understanding of
the structure–reactivity relationships that govern binding
affinity to diols. In this study, various boronic acids and other
organoboron compounds were investigated to determine their pKa and their binding constants with the biologically
relevant diols including sorbitol, fructose, and glucose. Boronic
acid pKa values were determined through
spectroscopic titration, whereas binding constants were determined
by fluorescence spectroscopy during competitive binding studies. Key
structure–reactivity relationships clearly indicated that both
boronic acid structure and solution pH must be carefully considered.
By considering a variety of boronic acids with systematically varied
electronics and sterics, these results provide guidance during selection
of organoboron compounds in sensing, delivery, and materials chemistry.

Introduction
Boronic acids and boronic
acid analogs have been employed for a
number of biomedical applications, for example, in sensors and drug
delivery.1 Sensors provide rapid, quantitative
resolution of analytes and are important in the field of diagnostic
medicine.2,3 Boronic acids have been shown to be effective
sensors for various saccharides, polysaccharides, glycoproteins, glycated
proteins, and dopamine. Sensing occurs primarily through the formation
of boronate esters with 1,2- or 1,3-diols present on the substrate.4,5 Careful design of macromolecules containing boronic acids can also
allow for the controlled release of encapsulated pharmaceuticals.6,7 Release profiles are generally dictated by formation of boronate
esters with the macromolecules, resulting in a concomitant adjustment
in material properties or morphology. Mixing of boronic acid and diol
functional polymers also allows access to self-healing materials8,9 or hydrogels.10−12 In boronic acid-containing thermoresponsive hydrogels,
the binding of glucose or fructose with boronic acid units along the
hydrogel backbone causes an increase in the hydrophilicity of the
hydrogel, resulting in gel swelling,13,14 increased
pore size, and more rapid diffusion of encapsulated therapeutics through
the gel. Similar effects were seen for sugar binding of thermoresponsive
boronic acid co-polymers.15,16 In boronic acid-modified
nanoassemblies or in boronate ester-stabilized nanoparticles, the
binding of saccharides often results in an increase of material solubility,
causing a disruption in nanoassemblies and a release of encapsulated
therapeutics.

Understanding the interactions of boronic acids
with various substrates
is important for the design of sensors and release devices. Diol-binding
constants can be determined directly for boronic acids having absorbance
or fluorescence characteristics that depend strongly on ester formation.
However, for boronic acids that do not exhibit readily observable
shifts in spectroscopic properties upon ester formation, determination
of binding constants can be less straightforward and often relies
on pH-depression methods which require high boronic acid concentrations
and assumes that esterification always results in anionic boronate
ester formation with a negligible concentration of neutral boronic
ester.17,18 The pH-depression method also assumes that
the boronic esters have a lower pKa than
the free boronic acid, which may not always be the case.19 Wang and Springsteen examined the nature of
boronate ester formation and diol binding through the use of Alizarin
Red S (ARS), a hydrophilic dye. In solution, ARS exhibits a blue shift
in absorbance upon binding with a boronic acid.20,21 Displacement of ARS by a diol results in a red shift back to the
characteristic absorbance of unmodified ARS.

The binding of
ARS with boronic acids also results in an increase
in fluorescence intensity. In solution, excited-state proton transfer
between the catechol hydroxyl groups and the adjacent ketone results
in quenching of the ARS fluorescence.22 Upon ester formation, this proton transfer is no longer possible,
and fluorescence quenching is not observed. To examine the binding
of diol substrates with various boronic acids, the displacement of
the ARS–boronate ester with the substrate disrupts the ARS-ester
equilibrium, resulting in reduced fluorescence intensity (Figure 1). This three-component
system allows for determination of diol association constants.

Figure 1 ARS binding
and transesterification scheme. (A) Upon ester formation
with the boronic acid, the ARS adduct becomes fluorescent. (B) The
fluorescence intensity decreases upon displacement with a competing
diol.

ARS–boronate esters have
been employed for both the examination
of diol association constants23−26 and the development of diol sensors.27−29 Previous studies have investigated the effects of substituents on
boronic acid–diol binding but have not broadly compared various
boronic acid classes. Furthermore, apparent diol-binding constants
as determined by the ARS competitive binding assay have been shown
to be dependent on a number of factors, including solution pH, boronic
acid structure, and most importantly, buffer composition. As such,
it is important to ensure that apparent association constants are
determined under identical conditions to allow comparative evaluations
of boronic acid species. This study evaluates six boronic acids and
boronic acid analogs across a wide pH range and under identical solution
conditions to provide a true comparison between boronic acid classes
in terms of diol binding.

Results and Discussion
Six boronic
acids and analogs were chosen (Figure 2). Both 3-acetamidophenylboronic acid (3-AcPBA)
and 4-methylcarbamoylphenylboronic acid (4-MCPBA) were chosen as analogs
of boronic acids used previously in our research30−32 and by other
groups.14,33−35 Benzoxaboroles (benzoboroxoles,
BOB) have also seen limited use in self-assembled polymeric nanoassemblies.36−39 Wulff-type boronic acids, similar in structure to 2-dimethylaminomethylphenylboronic
acid (DAPBA), are of great interest in biomedical applications.40−44 However, there has been very limited investigation of glucose binding
with Wulff-type boronic acids, which is vital in development of glucose-responsive
materials.25 The monomers are divided into
classes, with 4-formylphenylboronic acid (4-FPBA) and 4-MCPBA being
electron-deficient acids and 3-AcPMA representing more traditional
boronic acids as an analog of the most widely studied motif. DAPBMA
is an internally coordinated boronic acid, and BOB is a heterocyclic
boronic acid analog. Interestingly, as discussed later, 2-formylphenylboronic
acid (2-FPBA) exists somewhere between a heterocyclic boronic acid
and an internally coordinated boronic acid.

boronic acids and boronic acid analogs investigated.

The determination of boronic acid–diol-binding
constants
involves a three-component competitive binding assay.20,21 The association constant between each boronic acid and ARS (KARS) must first be determined. To do this, each
boronic acid was titrated into a constant concentration of ARS. Formation
of the boronic acid–ARS adduct resulted in an increase in solution
fluorescence intensity. To derive the relationship between the association
constant (KARS) and fluorescence intensity,
we first considered the relationship between the association constant
and the concentration of the solution components, given by eq 1, where [BA·ARS] is
the concentration of the boronic acid–ARS conjugate, [BA] is
the free boronic acid concentration, and [ARS] is the free ARS concentration.
As the boronic acid is in large excess relative to ARS, the concentration
of the boronic acid is considered constant within each sample. 1  

Equation 1 can be
rewritten as eq 2. 2  

Equation 2 can
be
further rearranged to give eq 3 3  The fluorescence intensity for any given concentration
of BA·ARS is given by eq 4, where If is the fluorescence
intensity, k is a constant related to instrument
parameters such as monochromator throughput, ϕ is the quantum
yield, Io is the incident light intensity,
ε is the molar absorptivity, and b is the path
length. 4  Rearrangement of eq 4 allows for determination
of BA·ARS concentration,
as given by eq 5. 5  Substitution of eq 5 into eq 3 gives eq 6. 6  Equation 6 can be rearranged to give eq 7, the Benesi–Hildebrand equation. 7  Given eq 7, the ARS association constant, KARS, can be found from the plot of 1/If vs
1/[BA] for a titration of a boronic acid with a solution of constant
ARS concentration. The association constant was determined by dividing
the plot intercept by the slope. Examples of these plots can be found
in the Supporting Information.

Once KARS was known, the apparent boronic
acid–diol association constant (Keq) was determined through a competitive binding assay. Each diol was
titrated into a solution with constant boronic acid and ARS concentrations.
Increasing the diol concentration displaced a fraction of the ARS
from the boronic acid–ARS adduct, resulting in a decrease in
fluorescence intensity. The equilibrium for the displacement of the
boronic acid–ARS adduct with a diol is shown in Scheme 1.  

Scheme 1 Equilibrium

with a Diol
The mass-balance expressions
for the individual components are
given by eqs 8–10. 8   9   10  The association constant for each
diol, Keq, is given by eq 11. 11  Combining the mass-balance equations
with eqs 1 and 11 gives eq 12. 12  If we define the indicator ratio, Q, by eq 13, then eq 12 can be
rewritten as eq 14. 13   14  

If we define a quantity, P, as given by eq 15, then eq 14 can be rewritten as eq 16. 15  

 16  Equation 16 can be rewritten as eq 17. 17  Given eq 17, the boronic acid–diol
association constant, Keq, can be found
from a plot of [diol]o/P vs Q. The association constant
can be determined by dividing KARS by
the slope of the plot. The value Q can be obtained
from measured fluorescence intensities as given by eq 18, where If,BA·ARS is the fluorescence intensity of the boronic
acid–ARS adduct in the absence of competitive diol, If,ARS is the fluorescence intensity of ARS,
and If is the measured fluorescence intensity
in the presence of competitive diol.16,36 18  Examples of these plots can be found
in the Supporting Information.

A
number of studies have examined the substitution (or heterocyclic
ring structure in the case of benzoxaboroles) of boronic acids to
determine the effect of these modifications of boronic acid pKa and binding affinity.19,20,25,45,46 However, these studies have been performed under
a number of different conditions, leading to determinations of association
constants that can vary between studies.47 In many of these investigations, the binding affinity was found
in aqueous/organic co-solvent systems, which was necessary to solubilize
the boronic acids in question.25,48 As such, there is a
need for a study that examines the association constants of a variety
of boronic acid families under identical conditions to better identify
the most viable candidates for future applications.

Determination of Boronic
Acid pKa Values
The pKa of a boronic
acid is defined as the pH at which 50% of the boronic acid exists
as the hydroxyboronate anion species. Many applications of boronic
acids rely on a shift in solubility or solute–solvent favorability,
which is often dictated by the transition from hydrophobic neutral
boronic acid to the anionic hydroxyboronate or boronate ester. As
such, employing a boronic acid with a pKa much higher than physiological pH may not yield a material or device
with an optimum response profile under physiological conditions. It
has been shown that the binding affinity of a boronic acid is often
related to the pKa of the boronic acid,
although the most effective binding is not always near or above the
pKa of the boronic acid.19 Several studies have proposed that optimal binding should
occur at a pH between the pKa of the boronic
acid and of the diol, as given by eq 19, although this may not account for secondary effects,
such as buffer composition, steric hindrance, or solvent composition,
which can affect the ability to form boronic esters.19 19  In this study, the pKa of each boronic acid was determined by monitoring
the UV
absorption of each molecule as a function of pH. As the boronic acid
transitions from the neutral trigonal planar species to the tetrahedral
boronate center, the absorbance at wavelengths ranging from approximately
200 to 260 nm decreases, allowing for facile pKa determinations. The measured pKa’s are given in Table 1, and examples of titration data can be found in the Supporting Information.

Table 1 Measured
pKa Values for Various Boronic Acids and
Analogs
Unmodified phenylboronic
acid has previously been shown to have
a pKa of approximately 9.0.49 To adjust the pKa, the aromatic ring can be modified with electron-withdrawing or
-donating substituents. Of the boronic acids investigated, 3-acetamidophenylboronic
acid (3-AcPBA) was found to have the highest pKa, whereas the electron-withdrawing inductive and resonance
effects for both 4-methylcarbamoylphenylboronic acid (4-MCPBA) and
4-formylphenylboronic acid (4-FPBA) result in a decrease of pKa for both boronic acids.50

Benzoxaborole (BOB) is a heterocycle-modified boronic
acid, with
a pKa significantly lower than 3-AcPBA,
4-MCPBA, or 4-FPBA. The lower pKa is driven
by the release of ring strain in the five-membered ring as the boron
center transitions from a trigonal planar geometry in the neutral
form to a tetrahedral geometry in the boronate anion form, with the
heterocycle being retained.46 Interestingly,
the pKa of 2-formylphenylboronic acid
(2-FPBA) is similar to that of BOB. This is likely due to intramolecular
interaction between the carbonyl oxygen and the boron center. It has
been shown that in aqueous solution, 2-FPBA can exist as an isomer
of similar structure to BOB, forming a benzoxaborole heterocycle with
a hydroxyl substituent on the methylene unit between the aromatic
ring and the oxygen derived from the carbonyl. This observation is
due to tautomerization of the carbonyl, followed by a ring closing
cyclization (Scheme 2).51 The formation of this heterocycle
is more favorable as the pH of the solution increases, resulting in
2-FPBA having a pKa similar to that of
BOB.

Scheme 2 Tautomeric Equilibrium of 2-FPBA
Scheme 3 pH-Dependent Coordination of an Amine to a Boron Center in
Wulff-Type
Boronic Acids
The boronic acid with
the lowest measured pKa was 2-dimethylaminomethylphenylboronic
acid (DAPBA). This
family of boronic acids, containing an adjacent coordinating amine
center, is often referred to as a “Wulff-type” boronic
acid52 and is characterized by the nitrogen
center coordinating with boron to form a tetrahedral boronate. As
such, the pKa of this boronic acid is
formally the pKa of the amine center,
as deprotonation of the amine results in the B–N coordinative
interaction. It has been previously shown that both secondary and
tertiary amines have similar effects on boronic acid activity.53 Further increase in solution pH results in formation
of the hydroxyboronate anion and release of the adjacent amine (Scheme 3). Recently, there
have been some evidences of a solvent insertion mechanism also taking
place with Wulff-type boronic acids, whereby a polar protic solvent
such as water or methanol can donate electron density to the boron
center. In this mechanism, the solvent insertion results in the formation
of an anionic boronate center and a cationic ammonium center.54,55

Apparent Association Constants for Various Boronic Acid Families
The association between a boronic acid and a diol is affected by
a number of factors, including boronic acid pKa, diol pKa, dihedral angle of
the diol, steric hindrance, and stabilization of the boronate center.
Given the acidity of aromatic hydroxyl groups and the planar nature
of the diol, it is common for catechol-functionalized molecules to
have high binding constants at relatively low pH. As such, Alizarin
Red S, a catechol functional molecule, demonstrates a high affinity
for boronic acids is often used as a fluorescent reporter, as it becomes
fluorescent upon binding with a boronic acid. This provides a direct
method for determination of binding constants with ARS (Table 2). The binding of ARS was found
to follow a similar pattern for most of the boronic acids in question,
with the highest association constant found near physiological pH.
The exception was DAPBA, where the association constant was significantly
higher for DAPBA under acidic conditions, potentially due to an electrostatic
attraction between the protonated ammonium center below the amine
pKa and the anionic sulfonate group on
ARS. For the boronic acids with functional groups directly attached
or adjacent to boron (BOB, 2-FPBA, and DAPBA), the association constants
were much lower than those for the other boronic acids, likely due
to steric hindrance at the boron center. For measurements where the
apparent association constant was too low to be reliably determined,
the value is reported as n/d (not determined).

We were interested in investigating the association
constants of
the boronic acids and sorbitol, as the sugar alcohol can potentially
behave as a multifunctional diol for crosslinking between boronic
acids or as a competitive binding agent. The latter is of great importance
in heterogeneous separation devices for release of captured diol functional
molecules in affinity chromatography.56 Of the sugar and sugar alcohols investigated, sorbitol had the highest
association constants with each boronic acid as compared to fructose
and glucose, even though sorbitol, fructose, and glucose all have
a pKa close to 12.5. This increased affinity
is likely due to the availability of the diols in solution, as both
fructose and glucose can exist as various linear and cyclic isomers.
Of the possible fructose isomers, β-d-fructofuranose
has been shown to have the highest binding constant and an abundance
of around 25% in aqueous solution, whereas the glucose isomer with
the highest binding constant has been shown to be α-d-glucofuranose, which has an abundance of approximately 0.14%.57 For the unhindered boronic acids, the association
constant with sorbitol increased with decreasing pKa. This pattern remained true for both fructose and glucose.

Despite the fact that the sterically hindered boronic acids have
significantly lower pKa values than the
unhindered boronic acids, it was observed that the association constants
for the bulky boronic acids were considerably lower for sorbitol and
fructose, with similar binding constants for glucose. This counterintuitive
observation highlights the need for an understanding of the effect
of structure on binding affinity and to not assume that a lower pKa will consistently result in a higher association
constant. The glucose association constants for BOB and 2-FPBA were
among the highest values of the various boronic acids, with 2-FPBA
having a slightly higher association constant than BOB at neutral
pH. At higher pH, where intramolecular cyclization of 2-FPBA is increasingly
favored, the association constants for 2-FPBA and BOB are very similar.
The slightly higher glucose association constants of BOB and 2-FPBA,
coupled with the lower pKa of the boronic
acids, make these classes of materials fit for glucose-responsive
systems.

DAPBA, the Wulff-type boronic acid, which has been
applied for
self-healing hydrogels31 and glucose detection
devices,2 had the lowest association constants
at neutral and basic pH of all of the boronic acids investigated.
Other groups have observed the lower binding affinity of Wulff-type
boronic acids at neutral and basic pH.16 Interestingly, the association constants at acidic pH were notably
higher than those for all other boronic acids, likely due to the electrostatic
stabilization of the boronate species with the cationic ammonium ion.
The ability to stabilize esters at relatively low pH has been utilized
to prepare hydrogels at acidic pH.32

Conclusions
Even with the increased association constants
of BOB and 2-FPBA,
glucose binding is still much lower than the binding of other biologically
relevant diols, such as fructose. This binding preference may be overcome
through the use of specially designed diboronic acid ligands, in which
the three-dimensional space between the boronic acids is designed
to favor binding of one type of diol over others.58 Furthermore, there is a need for an investigation of binding
constants with polymeric boronic acids as a function of boronic acid
structure, co-monomer composition, and polymer architecture (block
co-polymers, star polymers, hyperbranched polymers, etc.) It is likely
that for a given boronic acid structure, polymeric boronic acids likely
have a higher pKa and lower binding affinity
than their small molecule analogs. This is largely a result of neighboring
effects, where steric hindrance between neighboring units would limit
available binding sites, and electrostatic effects would make ionization
of neighboring boronic acid units more energetically unfavorable.
However, sterics and molecular geometry in polymeric systems can be
used to gain selectivity, such as in molecularly imprinted networks,
where the targeted substrate is incorporated during network formation,
precluding the binding of other diols for purely steric reasons.59 However, these approaches are often more synthetically
challenging and may not be applicable in all scenarios. As such, to
enhance the efficiency and specificity of binding between boronic
acid–diol pairs, it is necessary to have knowledge of the characteristics
of each boronic acid family.

As the data above demonstrate,
the design of boronic acid-functional
materials requires an understanding of fundamental structure–property
and structure–reactivity relationships, including pKa, binding affinity, and relative selectivity.
This study provides a direct comparison of various boronic acid families,
allowing for the informed selection of boronic acid moieties for each
application. Many materials intended for physiological applications
have relied on boronic acids that are similar in structure to 3-AcPBA
or 4-MCPBA, whereas those boronic acids have been shown to have a
pKa much higher than physiological pH
and glucose association constants lower than those of other boronic
acid families. Wulff-type boronic acids have seen relatively widespread
use, even though the bulky nature of the amine results in very low
diol-binding constants at neutral and basic pH. The results of this
research indicate that heterocyclic boronic acids, like benzoxaboroles,
or boronic acids with less hindered electron-donating species, like
2-formylphenylboronic acid, may provide the best response profile
under physiological conditions.
