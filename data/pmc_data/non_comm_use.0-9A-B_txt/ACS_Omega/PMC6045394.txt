The
need to develop new alternatives for antimalarial treatment
is urgent. Herein, we report the synthesis and antimalarial evaluation
of a small library of synthetic 3-alkylpyridine marine alkaloid (3-APA)
analogs. First, the compounds were evaluated in vitro against Plasmodium falciparum. The most active compound 5c was selected for optimization of its antimalarial properties.
An in silico approach was used based on pure ab initio electronic
structure prediction, and the results indicated that a substitution
of the hydroxyl group by a fluorine atom could favor a more stable
complex with heme at a molecular ratio of 2:1 (heme/3-APA halogenated).
A new fluorinated 3-APA analog was synthesized (compound 7), and its antimalarial activity was re-evaluated. Compound 7 exhibited optimized antimalarial properties (P. falciparum IC50 = 2.5 μM), low
genotoxicity, capacity to form a more stable heme/3-APA complex at
a molecular ratio of 2:1, and conformity to RO5. The new compound,
therefore, has great potential as a new lead antimalarial agent.

Introduction
Malaria is a serious
infectious disease caused by apicomplexan
of the genus Plasmodium, transmitted
through blood consumed by female Anopheles mosquitos. Malaria still remains a worldwide public health problem
and is responsible for a high degree of morbidity and mortality.1 More than 100 Plasmodium species have been reported, although only 5 are considered as human
malaria parasites: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium knowlesi.2 Infection caused by P. falciparum, as well as being a serious condition, can also evolve to a neurological
syndrome known as cerebral malaria.3

Malaria chemotherapy is one of the major strategies for treatment
and control of this infection. Therefore, the search for new antimalarial
drug candidates has become urgent because of the emergence of parasites
resistant against artemisinin-based combination therapy.4 This perilous situation requires efforts not
only for the development of new antimalarial compounds but also for
the identification of their targets and mechanisms of action.5

A relatively inexpensive method to investigate
antimalarial targets
that may suggest their possible mechanisms of action is the use of
in silico approaches.6 These methods, in
association with experimental approaches such as in vitro assays,
biophysical techniques to determine drug–target interactions,
and genetic toxicology evaluation, could improve the optimization
process and lead to new antimalarial drugs.7

In recent years, we have focused our research activity on
the synthesis
and antimalarial evaluation of 3-alkylpyridine marine alkaloid (3-APA)
analogs. Since our first report of antimalarial activity of a small
series of 3-APA analogs,8 we have described
the mechanism of action of the two most active compounds by employing
in silico and biophysical approaches. These 3-APA analogs target hematin
and are able to form stable complexes at a molecular ratio of 2:1
(hematin/3-APA).9

In an attempt to
improve antimalarial activity, selectivity, and
safety, herein, we report the synthesis of a larger library of 3-APA
analogs based on our previous studies,8,9 using variations
of the side chain length and the type of the functional group attached
to the end of this chain. The most active compound was halogenated
with fluorine in an attempt to achieve higher target affinity, effective
antimalarial activity, increased selectivity, and improved safety.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
Part I
The synthesis
of the 3-APA analogs is shown
in Scheme 1. The target
compounds 4a–d to 6a–d were
obtained in five steps, with moderate to good yields, from easily
available starting materials. The synthesis of 1a–d to 5a–d was performed as previously reported
by our research group.10 Briefly, the 1,n-diols 1a–d were selectively protected
to generate the corresponding monotetrahydropyranyl acetals 2a–d. The monoprotected alcohols 2a–d were mesylated under classical conditions to give compounds 3a–d followed by Williamson etherification under phase-transfer
catalysis11 of commercial 3-(pyrid-3-yl)propan-1-ol
with the mesylated derivatives 3a–d to give the
3-APA analogs 4a–d. Deprotection of compounds 4a–d with HCl afforded the analogs 5a–d. Finally, the alcohols 5a–d were converted into
their respective aldehydes 6a–d by Swern oxidation
methodology,12 with yields ranging from
60–95%.

analogs 4a–d, 5a–d, and 6a–d (Table 1).

Antimalarial Activity
Part
I
Initially, the first 3-APA derivatives 4a–d, 5a–d, and 6a–d synthesized
were evaluated in vitro against P. falciparum (W2 strain), and their cytotoxicity was evaluated against a human
fibroblast cell line (WI-26VA4) (Table 1). All studied compounds were moderately active against P. falciparum, with IC50 values ranging
from 8.9 to 210.6 μM. The therapeutic potential of the assayed
molecules was determined by their selectivity index (SI). Compound 5c exhibited one of the lowest IC50 values of the
series, 14.7 μM, and the highest SI, 6.7. At the end of this
process, we decided to focus our efforts on optimization of the antimalarial
properties of compound 5c.

To improve the antimalarial
activity of compound 5c, it was decided to evaluate in
silico the substitution of the hydroxyl group by a fluorine atom,
leading to the compound numbered as 7 (Scheme 2), aiming to favor acid/base
interactions between the fluorine (a hard base) and hard acid Fe3+ from hematin. Metal complexes with Fe3+–F
interaction are relatively rare in comparison to those containing
other halogens.13 However, there are some
reports in the literature describing fluoride Fe3+ porphyrinates
complexes.14,15 Furthermore, the incorporation
of fluorine into molecules can enhance some of their pharmacological
properties, such as increasing their target affinity, changing their
lipophilicity, modulating membrane permeability, and thus increasing
their potency.7,16,17

Reagents, conditions, and yields:
(i) DAST, DCM, 0 °C, 18 h, 16%.

In Silico
Results
The UB3LYP optimized geometry for
the 2:1 complex is depicted in Figure 1a. It can be seen from Table 2 that the 2:1 complex formation with ligand 7 is highly energetically favored (ΔE and ΔG are quite negative values) in comparison
with compound 5c. This result demonstrates greater chemical
affinity of the compound 7 toward the heme group. The
replacement of the hydroxyl group by fluorine in 3-APA analog 5c was, therefore, a viable strategy to increase the interactions
between the R edge group and [Fe(III)PPIX]. According to the qualitative
hard soft acid bases principle,18 the fluorine
atom is a hard base and forms stable complexes with acid cations in
which simple ionic interactions are dominant. Fe3+ in the
heme group has hard acid characteristics such as being an acceptor
with a positive charge, having a small size with no easily polarized
valence electrons, and tending to bind to hard bases. Furthermore,
the energetic results found here are similar to those reported for
azide analogs (N3–), from the first generation
of 3-APA analogs, which have shown small IC50 values and
favorable binding energies.9 Azide also
presents hard/borderline base characteristics. Hard acid/base interactions
are predominantly electrostatic. This qualitative principle is in
line with our theoretical findings because in our previous work,9 we have shown that the driving force responsible
for 2:1 complex formation is electronic energy (ΔE). In addition, it is important to highlight that the bonding between
hard acids and bases can be properly described by the quantum mechanical
calculations applied here.

and (b) compound 5a in a 2:1 molar ratio.

298 K and 1 atm with all values given in kcal·mol–1

On the other hand, the
2:1 complex formed with the compound 5a, which presents
the worst antimalarial activity (Table 1), is less energetically
favored. This result evidences the weak affinity of the compound 5a for its target and is strongly affected by (i) hard base
characteristics and (ii) the short alkyl chain (n = 6). Although the hydroxyl group also presents hard base characteristics,
they are less pronounced when compared with fluorine, and the binding
strength usually increases as the electrostatic anion characteristic
increases. The alkyl chain length also influences the biological activity.
This was also observed in our previous work,9 that is, the longer the alkyl chain, the more biologically active
the analogs are. The alkyl chain length affects the distance between
the analog and both heme sites, influencing the formation of hydrogen
bonds and other interactions. The UB3LYP-optimized geometry for the
2:1 complex is depicted in Figure 1b. Cartesian coordinates for the optimized structure
of the compound 7 complex (Figure S1), compound 5a complex (Figure S2), and UB3LYP absolute electronic energies (E) calculated for compounds 5a and 7 complexes in a 2:1 molar ratio (Table S1) are presented in the Supporting Information.

Synthesis
Part II
On the basis of our in silico studies, we performed
the synthesis of the fluorinated ligand 7. It was synthesized
in a 16% yield by diethylamino sulfur trifluoride (DAST) fluorination
of the corresponding alcohol 5c.

Antimalarial
Activity
Part II
The in vitro antimalarial activity of compound 7 was significantly increased (5.8 fold) compared to compound 5c, with an IC50 of 2.5 μM and an SI value
equal to 11.2 against a P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant strain W2. Similar results were achieved against
a P. falciparum chloroquine-sensitive
strain 3D7 (IC50 of 2.3 μM and an SI value of 12.2)
(Table 3).

This improvement in its drug-likeness
is in agreement with a recently established set of criteria for the
development of compounds with activity against malaria.19–21 Some of these criteria were
met by compound 7 such as the following: (i) there is
preliminary knowledge of the structure–activity relationship;
(ii) there is a cutoff in vitro potency around 1–2 μM;
(iii) the SI is greater than 10-fold using a human cell line; and
(iv) compound 7 was synthesized in 5 steps. In addition,
concerning physicochemical properties, we analyzed conformity to the
“rule of five” as a predictor of effectiveness in oral
therapy (Table 4).
No violations of this rule were observed on replacement of the hydroxyl
group by a fluorine atom in compound 7.

On the basis of these data, the next step
was to investigate the

Biophysical
Heme Binding Study
Mass Spectrometry Studies
To experimentally
prove the
interaction between the new fluorinated derivative and hematin, a
mixture containing both molecules was prepared and injected into a
mass spectrometer to check for the presence of complexes. Mass spectrometry
(MS) is a very useful technique for the evaluation of molecular recognition
events because of the clear response provided in the mass/charge relationship.
In a typical spectrum where there are host and guest molecules, one
can observe peaks corresponding to the individual molecules and their
complexes. Another very useful feature of this technique is that it
is able to furnish the binding stoichiometry, its determination being
one of the great challenges in the supramolecular association field.

On the basis of our previous report,9 the 2:1 complexes are energetically about three times more stable
than the 1:1 complexes. Thus, it is mandatory to consider the 2:1
molar ratio to appropriately describe their antimalarial activity.
During the erythrocytic cycle of P. falciparum, large amounts of hemoglobin are degraded inside its digestive vacuole.
The hemoglobin degradation rate is of the order of magnitude of 0.06
fmol/h per vacuole.16 This consumption
is considered high, much more than they require for protein biosynthesis.17 To mimetize this condition experimentally, we
prepared a solution containing compound 7 (5.0 μmol/L)
and hematin (30.0 μmol/L) in 40% DMSO/H2O. We used
six times the concentration of hematin in relation to the compound 7, consequently increasing the concentration of the ternary
complex (compound 7/hematin 1:2) in solution to observe
its peak, although the experiment amounts of compounds were limited
by the typical concentration ranges (μM/L) used in MS in contrast
to higher concentrations of hematin found in vivo. And following this
logic, it was possible to observe the peak of the second complex (2:1)
when using a medium with a higher hematin concentration in relation
to compound 7.

In Figure 2, there
are three important peaks in the main spectrum. The two peaks at 296.2411
and 616.1809/694.1947 correspond to the ligand ([M + H]+) and hematin ([M]+, [M + DMSO]+). At 911.4117
([M]+), there is a peak corresponding to the 1:1 complex
of ligand–hematin. A more detailed inspection of the spectrum
revealed a small peak at 1562.5519 ([M + Cl]+), which corresponds
to the mass of two hematin molecules and one ligand, thus representing
the 1:2 complex (inset data in Figure 2). The low intensity of this peak is in agreement with
the low concentration found for this complex because of its low second
association constant.

Figure 2 Mass spectra [electrospray ionisation time-of-flight mass
spectrometry
(TOF)] of solutions containing ligand and heme showing (A) peaks corresponding
to the complex association (compound 7—[M + H]+ = 296.2411 (calculated = 296.2390); hematin—[M]+ = 616.1809 (calculated = 616.1773); hematin–DMSO [M]+ = 694.1947 (calculated = 694.1912); and 1:1 complex M+ = 911.4117 (calculated = 911.4084); inset: 1:2 complex [M
+ Cl]+ = 1562.5519 (calculated = 1562.5546) and (B) MS–MS
spectra of 1:1 complex ions from solutions containing ligand and heme.

Isolation of the 911.4117 peak
and its submission to soft fragmentation
furnished a spectrum with peaks corresponding to hematine, thus confirming
that the complex was formed noncovalently by these host–guest
molecules (Figure 2B). Besides that, the UV–vis experiment (Jobs plot) confirmed
the interaction of these molecules and the stoichiometry of complex
formation (Figure S3, Supporting Information).

The antimalarial development chain can be hampered by a
number
of different variables, one of which is the inherent toxicity of the
compounds in humans.22 Thus, an important
process in the preclinical stage of drug development is genetic toxicology
evaluation.

Genotoxicity Evaluation
To complete
the analyses in
this study, the genotoxic effects of compound 7 were
evaluated by applying the comet assay, the cytokinesis-block micronucleus
(CBMN) assay and the Ames assay. The comet assay is a relatively simple
method for measuring DNA damage at the level of individual cells.23 The micronucleus assay permits the detection
of fixation of chromosomal mutations induced by clastogenesis (DNA
breakages) or aneugenesis (chromosomal losses).24 The Ames assay identifies agents able to induce gene mutations
by additions, deletions, or substitutions of bases in the DNA structure.25 The combination of these methodologies in genetic
toxicological studies is an important tool for early safety evaluation
in the drug development process.26 These
assays offer a reliable set of data for the evaluation of the carcinogenicity
of drug candidates.

As observed in Figure 3, three concentrations of compound 7 were assessed in comet assays in the RKO-AS45-1 human cell
line, and only the highest concentration analyzed (17.7 μM)
was genotoxic, with a mean score that was significantly different
from the negative control (PBS). It is interesting to highlight that
this genotoxic concentration is about seven times higher than the
IC50 defined for compound 7 against P. falciparum (2.5 μM).

Figure 3 Mean and SD of the score
values obtained in three independent experiments
employing the comet assay with compound 7 in the RKO-AS45-1
human cell line. P < 0.05 when compared with the
negative control (phosphate buffered saline, PBS).

The CBMN assay was also performed using the RKO-AS45-1
cell line,
and the results are observed in Figure 4. In this assay, compound 7 was evaluated
in concentrations ranging from 2.5 to 17.7 μM. It was observed
that the frequency of micronuclei was altered only at concentrations
higher than the IC50 of compound 7 against P. falciparum. None of the concentrations assessed
affected the nuclear division index (NDI) values, indicating that
the proliferation rate was not altered by these treatments.

Figure 4 Frequency of
cells containing micronuclei in 1000 binucleated cells
observed in CBMN assay performed with the RKO-AS45-1 cell line exposed
for 3 h to compound 7.

The combination of the results observed in comet assay and
in CBMN
assay demonstrate that the compound 7 can induce chromosomal
mutations at higher concentrations not only by the induction of chromosomal
breakages but also by the induction of chromosomal losses. However,
these effects were observed only at concentrations higher than IC50 defined to P. falciparum.

Besides, the Ames assay, performed with the strains TA98 and TA100
of Salmonella typhimurium, with and
without metabolic activation, shows that compound 7 is
not able to induce gene mutations (Figure 5) in these conditions.

Figure 5 Mean of revertants and
SD observed after the treatment with different
concentrations of compound 7 in Ames assay performed
with TA98 and TA100 strains of S. typhimurium with (+S9) and without (−S9) metabolic activation.

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we performed the synthesis of a new halogenated
3-APA analog 7 with optimized antimalarial properties such as increased
activity against P. falciparum and
an increased SI. In addition, despite the structural modifications,
compound 7 retained its molecular target, forming a more
stable complex with heme.

Materials and Methods
In Vitro Schizonticidal
Activity of the 3-APA Analogs against P. falciparum
P. falciparum chloroquine-resistant
(W2) and chloroquine-sensitive (3D7) strains
were maintained in continuous culture using human red blood cells
in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with human plasma.27 Human red blood cells and human plasma were provided by
Foundation of Hemotherapy and Hematology of Minas Gerais (Fundação
Hemominas).

The parasites were synchronized using sorbitol treatment,28 and the parasitemias were evaluated microscopically
with Giemsa-stained blood smears.

The antimalarial activity
was determined using an ELISA antiHRPII
assay.29 Infected red blood cells were
plated in a 96-well plate at 0.05% parasitemia and 1.5% hematocrit.
Different concentrations of the drugs were added in triplicate, and
twelve drug-free wells were used as controls (six frozen after 24
h as the HRPII background). After the incubation (72 h), the plate
was frozen and thawed twice, and an ELISA using antiHRPII antibodies
was performed.

The results were expressed as the mean of the
half-maximal inhibitory
dose (IC50) of three assays with different drug concentrations
performed in triplicate, compared with drug-free controls. Curve fitting
was performed using OriginPro 8.0 software (Origin Lab. Corporation,
Northampton, MA, USA).

In Vitro Cytotoxicity Test
The noncancerous
human lung
fibroblast cell line WI-26-VA4 (ATCC CCL-95.1) was used to assess
the cell viability after each chemical treatment employing the MTT
colorimetric assay.30 Briefly, 1 ×
106 cells were plated in 96-well microplates with RPMI
1640 medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin–streptomycin
antibiotics. Then, microplates were incubated overnight at 37 °C,
5% CO2, followed by the treatment with each compound solubilized
in DMSO 0.1% (v/v). Negative control groups were constituted of cells
without treatment. Five serial dilutions (1:10) were made from a stock
solution (10 mg·mL–1) using RPMI supplemented
with 1% FBS. After 48 h of incubation, cell viability was evaluated
by discarding the medium and adding 100 μL of MTT 5%, followed
by 3 h of incubation. Then, the supernatant was discarded, and the
insoluble formazan product was dissolved in DMSO. The optical density
(OD) of each well was measured using a microplate spectrophotometer
at 550 nm. The OD in untreated control cells was defined as 100% cell
viability. All assays were performed in triplicate. The SI of the
3-APA analogs was calculated as SI = IC50 WI-26-VA4/IC50P. falciparum (strain W2
or 3D7).

Alkaline Comet Assay
The alkaline comet assay (single-cell
gel electrophoresis assay) was performed according to Olive and Banáth31 with adaptations. Briefly, RKO-AS45-1 (ATCC
CRL-2579) cells were seeded in 24-well plates (2 × 105 cells/well) in complete medium, and the treatments were performed
after 24 h. The cells were exposed to different concentrations of
compound 7 (5.9, 11.8, and 17.7 μM) for 3 h in
culture medium without serum. The cells of the positive control group
were treated with methyl methanesulfonate (MMS—120 μM),
and the negative control group was treated with PBS.

The quantification
of chromosomal damages was achieved by visual scoring, and the comets
were classified from 0 (no damage) to 4 (maximum damage).32 For each treatment, 100 comets were analyzed,
and the calculation of the scores was performed employing the equation
Score = 0(C0) + 1(C1) + 2(C2) + 3(C3) + 4(C4), where C0–C4
are the numbers of comets in each classification of damage.

Three independent experiments were performed, and a mean of the
scores obtained was calculated for each treatment. In the statistical
analysis, ANOVA (analysis of variance) was performed followed by the
Tukey–Kramer multiple comparisons posttest with a significance
level of 0.05.

CBMN Assay
To assess the potential
of compound 7 to induce chromosomal mutations in vitro,
the CBMN assay
was performed in the RKO-AS45-1 (ATCC CRL-2579) human cell line. The
procedures were carried out as described by Fenech,33 with adaptations.24 Briefly,
2.5 × 105 cells/well were seeded in 24-well plates
in complete medium, and the treatments were performed after 24 h.
MMS (400 μM) was used as the positive control, and the negative
control group received culture medium without serum as treatment.
Compound 7, diluted in culture medium without serum,
was evaluated in four different concentrations (2.5, 5.9, 11.8, and
17.7 μM), and three independent experiments were conducted under
these conditions.

After 3 h of treatment, cells were washed,
and fresh complete medium containing cytochalasin-B (3.0 μg/mL)
was added for 24 h. Next, cells were processed for the slides confection.
Slides were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole—1
μg/mL diluted in PBS for cytogenetic analysis under a fluorescent
microscope (Zeiss, Axioscope A1) with an excitation filter of 365
nm and a barrier filter of 445/450 nm in a blind test, 1000 binucleated
cells were analyzed for each treatment, and cells containing 1–3
micronuclei were scored,34 following the
criteria for the identification of micronuclei described in a previous
study.35 For statistical analysis, ANOVA
was performed followed by the Tukey’s multiple comparison posttest
with a significance level of 0.05.

The influence of compound 7 on cell proliferation
was assessed by calculating the NDI in the same slides prepared for
the CBMN assay. Three hundred cells with a well-preserved cytoplasm
were counted using fluorescence microscopy, as described above. The
NDI was calculated according to Fenech33 and Eastmond and Tucker,36 using the
equation NDI = (M1 + 2(M2) + 3(M3) + 4(M4))/N, where
M1–M4 are the numbers of cells with 1, 2, 3, and 4 nuclei,
respectively, and N is the total number of analyzed
cells.

Ames assay was performed using the highly sensitive protocol described
by Kado et al.37 with adaptations.38 Briefly, overnight cultures of S. typhimurium strains TA98 and TA100 (1 × 109 cells/mL) were 10× concentrated by centrifugation (4000g, 4 °C) and treated with five concentrations of compound 7 (ranging between 6.7 and 30.9 μM for TA100 and 16.7
and 77.5 μM for TA98). The mixtures were incubated for 90 min
at 37 °C without shaking. In tests with metabolic activation,
the S9 fraction (MOLTOX, Inc.) was added before incubation. After
this time, 2 mL of top agar (0.6% agar, 0.5% NaCl, 0.5 mM l-histidine, 0.5 mM biotin, pH 7.4) was added to the mixture and poured
on to a plate containing minimal agar (1.5% agar, Vogel–Bonner
E medium, containing 10% glucose). The frequency of his+ revertant colonies was manually counted
after incubation for 48 h (37 °C).

DMSO (10 μL/plate)
was used as a negative control for both strains. The positive controls
used for this assay in the absence and presence of the S9 fraction,
respectively, were 4-nitro-o-phenylenediamine and
2-aminoanthracene (2AA) for TA98 and sodium azide (SA) and 2AA for
TA100.

The SALANAL software was employed for statistical analysis,
adopting
the Bernstein model.39 The equation mutagenicity
index (MI) = Rev Trat/Rev Control was used to calculate the MI for
each concentration assessed, where “Rev Trat” is the
frequency of revertants per plate in treated groups and “Rev
Control” is the frequency of revertants in the negative control
group. Only treatments that induce an MI ≥ 2 were considered
mutagenic in this study.40

Synthesis Methods
General Procedure for the Synthesis of the
Aldehydes
To a solution of oxalyl chloride (2.2 equiv) in
DCM cooled at −60
°C, a solution of DMSO (4.4 equiv) was added in DCM. This solution
was stirred for 10 min at −60 °C, followed by the addition
of the alcohol 5a–d (1.0 equiv) solution in DCM.
After 15 min of stirring this reaction mixture, triethylamine (5.0
equiv) was added, and then the solution was left to warm to room temperature.
The reaction mixture was washed with brine, and the organic layer
was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated
under reduced pressure. The residue obtained was purified by column
chromatography (SiO2, EtOAc) to yield the pure aldehydes 6a–d.

General Procedure for the
Synthesis of the Fluorinated Product
To a solution of compound 5c (1.0 equiv) in DCM cooled
to 0 °C, DAST (1.1 equiv) was added. The reaction mixture was
allowed to warm at room temperature and stirred for 16 h. Subsequently,
water was added to quench the DAST excess. After that, the reaction
mixture was washed with a diluted solution of sodium bicarbonate (5
w/v %) and water. The organic layer was dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue
obtained was purified by column chromatography (SiO2, EtOAc)
to yield the pure compound 7c.

MS Investigation of the Heme–Ligand Complex
The binding
of ligands with heme was studied using a high-resolution
quadrupole-TOF electrospray mass spectroscopy (Bruker-Compact). Solutions
of mixture of ligands/heme were prepared in Milli-Q water/DMSO 6:4,
with concentrations of 5–30 μmol/L, and injected into
the mass spectrometer. The spectra were recorded in a positive mode.

In Silico Study
Density functional theory calculations
were performed to obtain, at the molecular level, structure and energetic
properties regarding the binding process of the compounds 5a, 5c, and 7 analogs with the heme group
[Fe(III)PPIX] in a 2:1 molar ratio. These three analogs were chosen
because of their very distinct biological activities.

In the
present work, we used the same theoretical methodology, that is, UB3LYP
with a mixed basis set, as described in our recent paper.9 The basis set used for all oxygen, fluorine,
nitrogen, and iron atoms was 6-31G(d,p). For the atoms belonging to
the CHn groups, a minimal STO-3G basis
set was assigned. The UB3LYP binding energy (ΔE) and the Gibbs free energy (ΔG) related to
this linking process were obtained. All theoretical calculations were
performed using the Gaussian 09 quantum mechanical package.41
