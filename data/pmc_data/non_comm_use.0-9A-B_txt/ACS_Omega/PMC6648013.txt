The stereodynamic
behavior of 1-arylpyrrolidin-2-imines, having
a Caryl–N stereogenic axis, has been studied by
means of dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance and density functional
theory calculations, evaluating the steric effect of ortho-aryl substituents. The rotational barrier due to E/Z isomerism about the −C=N–H
bond was also determined. The dynamic stereochemistry of homologous
six- and seven-membered iminoazacycloalkane rings and their oxo-analogues
was also comparatively investigated, evidencing a ring size effect.
It was found that the seven-membered heterocycle shows additional
dynamic features because of ring inversion.

Introduction
Many drugs containing
small-ring nitrogen heterocycles exhibit
a wide range of biological activities,1 and it is widely reported that the potency and selectivity are strongly
sensitive to the conformational constraints, as the ring size enlarges
from five to seven members. The combination of ring size and the appropriate
spatial and steric properties of the substituents bonded to the ring
lead to the preparation of potent and selective drugs of great interest
in medicinal chemistry. In particular, 2-iminoazaheterocycles are
potent inhibitors of human nitric oxide synthase (iNOS),2 and a recent synthesis of 1-aryl-2-iminoazacycloalkanes
from ω-halonitriles using polyphosphoric acid esters such as
ethyl polyphosphate (PPE) or trimethylsilyl polyphosphate (PPSE)3 gave the possibility to study the conformational
behavior about the N-aryl stereogenic axis in five
to seven membered heterocyclic
rings. These compounds can be easily converted into their oxo-analogues
by exposure to air (Scheme 1). Examples of dynamic conformational analysis due to a Csp2–N stereogenic axis have been reported:4 barbiturates are the most studied class of biologically
active compounds,5 and lactams,6 pyrroles,7 indoles,8 imides,9 azalidine-4-ones,10 thiazolidine-2-thiones,11 and xanthines12 are found to exhibit
stereodynamic properties.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Compounds 1–22
1-Aryl-2-iminoazacycloalkanes
are expected to have the plane of
the ortho-substituted phenyl ring significantly twisted
with respect to the time-averaged plane of the five-, six-, and seven-membered
heterocyclic ring. The existence of such an Ar–N stereogenic
axis would originate, in principle, a pair of stereolabile enantiomeric
forms when the rotation rate is rendered sufficiently slow in the
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) time scale. The aim of this paper
is a thorough investigation of the stereodynamic behavior of a new
class of compounds having a Caryl–N stereogenic
axis in a five-membered saturated ring,13 (1-arylpyrrolidin-2-imines 1–9 and their oxo-analogues 18–20Scheme 1), and the evaluation of the steric effect
of the ortho-aryl substituents. Moreover, the six-
and seven-membered imino homologues (10–13 and 14–17, respectively)
and their oxo-analogues 21–22 have
been prepared to evaluate the effect of the ring size and of the exocyclic
heteroatom on the N-aryl rotational barrier.

Results
and Discussion
When an ortho-substituted
aryl ring is bonded
to pyrrolidin-2-imines (Scheme 1), the steric hindrance caused by the ortho-substituent forces the aryl ring to adopt a skewed conformation
with respect to the almost planar heterocyclic ring, thus generating
a stereogenic axis and a pair of conformational enantiomers when the
rotational barrier is frozen; depending on the value of the rotational
barrier, stereolabile enantiomers or atropisomers can be generated.
In addition to the stereogenic axis, a second source of stereoisomerism
could be anticipated because of the presence of the imine moiety that
can have E or Z configuration.14 This conformational feature must be carefully
considered because of the different steric hindrance exerted by the
NH moiety in the E or Z stereoisomer
on the N-aryl ring rotation. To evaluate the energy
barriers for the N-aryl rotation, density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were performed using the M06-2X functional
and the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. All the optimized structures were
verified to be true ground states by frequency analysis, showing the
absence of imaginary frequencies. For each E/Z stereoisomer, the optimized structures showed that the
aryl ring was twisted with respect to the heterocyclic ring with C2′–Cq–N–C2 dihedral angles (ϕ) of about 60° and 120°,
yielding a total of four ground states (for compound 1, see Figure 1, top).
The interconversion of the two conformational enantiomers can occur
by the rotation of the aryl ring through two different transition
states where the heterocyclic and the aromatic ring are almost coplanar,
with dihedral angles ϕ close to 0° or 180° (TS1 and
TS2 in Figure 1, bottom).
In the case of compound 1, the calculated energy barriers
were 9.5 and 14.3 kcal mol–1 for the E stereoisomer, whereas they were calculated as 15.5 and 17.5 kcal
mol–1 in the Z-stereoisomer (all
the DFT-calculated energies and the computational details for compounds 1–22 are reported in the Supporting Information). The higher values calculated of the Z-stereoisomer are due to the larger steric hindrance caused
by the imine hydrogen in the transition state geometries.

Figure 1 Top: Four ground
states for compound 1 (in parentheses
the value of the dihedral angle). Bottom: Four possible transition
states for the N-aryl rotation (energies in the gas
phase are reported in kcal mol–1, relative to GS2-Z). Only the M-atropisomer is shown.

The lowest energy transition state
is that of the E stereoisomer with a dihedral angle
ϕ close to 180°; this
geometry avoids the steric clash between the ortho-substituent of the aryl ring and the imine NH and simultaneously
minimizes the steric interaction between the ortho-H and the NH. The calculated energy barriers range
from 2.9 kcal mol–1 for compound 4 (o-fluoro) up to 21.3 kcal mol–1 for compound 3, bearing a tert-butyl substituent in the ortho position. These energy barriers can be conveniently
observed by the variable-temperature NMR technique (D-NMR),15 thanks to the presence of enantiotopic groups
such as the two hydrogens of CH2, which turn into anisochronous
signals when the aryl rotation becomes slow in the NMR time scale.
An example of the dynamic NMR experiment is shown in Figure 2 for compound 1.

Figure 2 Left: 1H NMR signal of CH2 in position 5
of compound 1 at different temperatures (600 MHz in CD2Cl2). Right: Line shape simulations with the corresponding
rate constants k in s–1.

At ambient temperature, the enantiotopic
CH2 in position
5 shows a triplet signal because of the coupling with CH2 in position 4. On lowering the temperature, the signal broadens
and reaches the coalescence point at −64 °C, yielding
a diastereotopic ABX2 system below −91 °C.
From the rate constants obtained by line shape simulations at different
temperatures, the activation energy value of 10.2 ± 0.15 kcal
mol–1 was derived using the Eyring equation. As
usually happens in conformational processes, the activation entropy
was found to be negligible.15 The same
approach was used for compounds 2–22, and the experimental and calculated values are reported in Table 1 (variable-temperature
NMR spectra and line shape simulations are reported in the Supporting Information).16

In the case of compound 3, the calculated energy barrier
(21.3 kcal mol–1) is much higher than the other
compounds and indeed the two diastereotopic 5-CH2 signals
do not show any sign of dynamic exchange up to +120 °C, where
the product begins to decompose. Therefore, a kinetic study was performed
using one-dimensional exchange spectroscopy NMR (1D-EXSY NMR)17 at +105 °C and +110 °C in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). The saturation transfer due to aryl
rotation increases on raising the mixing time. First-order kinetic
analysis allowed to determine the rate constants, yielding a ΔG⧧ value of 22.0 kcal mol–1, in very good agreement with the DFT-calculated data (Figures 3 and S21 in the Supporting Information).

Figure 3 Kinetic study by 1D EXSY
NMR of compound 3 (600 MHz
in DMSO-d6). Spectra are relative to the
CH2 signals in position 5 at +110 °C.

On the other side, compound 4 has
the lowest calculated
energy barrier (2.9 kcal mol–1). In this case, the
spectra had to be recorded below −100 °C using CDFCl2 as the solvent (Figure 4). The dynamic phenomenon begins at −149 °C,
when the CH2 signal broadens, reaches the coalescence at
−156 °C, and eventually splits showing four signals at
−165 °C. This occurrence implies that two diastereomeric
conformations are present in a 73:27 ratio, both showing diastereotopic
hydrogens. An additional dynamic process, ascribable to the E/Z conversion, has thus to be taken into
account. The line shape simulations at different temperatures should
be performed using three rate constants (N-aryl rotation
in the E stereoisomer, N-aryl rotation
in the Z stereoisomer, and E/Z interconversion), but good simulations were obtained by
using only two kinetic constants. The first one accounts for the N-aryl rotation through the more stable transition state
where the imine is the E configuration (Figure 4, AB peaks exchange).
The second rate constant considers the exchange of E/Z stereoisomers (Figure 4, AC and BD peaks exchange), obtaining two
energy barrier values of 5.3 ± 0.3 and 6.5 ± 0.3 kcal mol–1, respectively. It must be underlined that the rotational
rate constant for the aryl ring in the imine Z configuration
is negligible because of the larger steric hindrance caused by the
hydrogen in the planar TS. This occurrence implies that the rotational
barrier in the stereoisomer is higher than the E/Z barrier, so the aryl rotation occurs only when the imine
is in the E geometry.18

of compound 4 at different temperatures (600 MHz in CDFCl2). Right: Line shape simulations with the corresponding rate
constants k.

To confirm the assignment of this second dynamic process
(i.e., E/Z interconversion of imine),
we synthesized
compound 9 with a p-methylphenyl substituent.
This compound cannot have enantiomeric conformations because of local
symmetry of the aryl ring, and any dynamic phenomenon has to be related
to the E/Z conversion, which yields
two diastereomeric conformations. Figure 5 shows the NMR spectra of compound 9. At −128 °C, the CH3 signal broadens
and eventually coalesces at −133 °C. At −149 °C,
two distinct diastereomeric singlet signals in a 70:30 ratio are visible.
An energy barrier of 6.9 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1 was
derived from line shape simulations at different temperatures, a value
identical to the higher barrier detected for compound 4.

Using the B-value scale reported by Lunazzi
et
al.19 as an indicator to estimate the steric
hindrance of various ortho-substituents, the very
good correlation between the B-values and the experimental
ΔG⧧ values of 1, 3–8 (black rhombus in Figure 6, the table of values
is reported in the Supporting Information) suggests that the magnitude of the enantiomerization barriers is
mainly due to steric effects, as also forecasted by DFT calculations.
It should be noted that the rotational barrier of the o-chloro compound is slightly smaller than that of the o-methyl, while the B-values series has opposite
trend. However, this result is in agreement with a recent evaluation
of the steric size of common substituents11b and with the steric size scale proposed by Sternhell.20

values derived from three steric scales (x-axis).
All the values are in kcal mol–1.

Six- and Seven-Membered Amidines
Switching from five-membered
rings to the six-membered analogues, the energy barriers increase
by about 5 kcal mol–1 (see Tables 1 and S6 and Figure S22 in the Supporting Information). This effect was previously
observed for the rotational barriers of N-aryl five-
and six-membered heterocyclic amidines (imidazolines and tetrahydropyrimidines,
respectively).21 For 2-iminoazaheterocycles,
the higher experimental value of six-membered derivatives is most
probably the result of two opposite factors. On the one side, the
higher steric constraints imposed in the TS by the different ring
size should raise the rotational barrier because of the higher steric
hindrance of the imino group in the TS. This effect is due to the
geometry of the six-membered ring that moves the =NH moiety
toward the aryl ring in the TS geometry. On the other side, the higher
flexibility of the six-membered ring allows the N-aryl group displacement in a pseudo-equatorial position, where the
steric hindrance of the exocyclic imino moiety is reduced. This preference
is well reproduced by DFT calculations on compound 11 (Figure S23 of the Supporting Information). The global minimum (GS4-Z in Figure S23) has the aryl ring in a pseudo-equatorial disposition,
while the threshold transition state corresponds to the rotation of
the o-fluorophenyl in a pseudo-axial disposition
and with the fluorine on the C=NH side (TS3-Z in Figure S23 of the Supporting Information).

In the case of the seven-membered ring, the increased flexibility
of the ring compensates the higher steric hindrance on the TS and
the energy barriers are similar to the six-membered rings. However,
the larger size of the ring combined with the planarity of the imino
portion makes the system to behave similar to a cyclohexane, with
the N–C1 moiety replacing a single carbon of cyclohexane.22

The N-aryl ring can arrange
itself onto a pseudo-equatorial
or pseudo-axial position, and both conformations have similar energies
(GS5-in and GS7-out, Figure 7).

angle). Top: Four ground states of the E stereoisomer.
Middle: Four ground states of the stereoisomer. Bottom: Four possible
transition states for the N-aryl rotation (energies
are reported in kcal mol–1, relative to GS7-out).
Only the P-conformations are shown.

In the case of compound 15 (Figure
S11 in the Supporting Information), the
triplet of the CH2 signal splits into two diastereotopic
signals below −62
°C and splits again into four signals on further lowering the
temperature below −75 °C. This behavior can be rationalized
by considering the simultaneous freezing of the aryl rotation and
the ring inversion, yielding two conformational diastereoisomers in
a ≈50:50 ratio, each one showing diastereotopic hydrogens for
CH2 (the E/Z interconversion
takes place at much lower temperatures and cannot be responsible for
the observed spectra). The two dynamic processes have similar energies
(9.5 ± 0.2 and 11.1 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1,
respectively). Compound 16 (aryl = o-chloro) was prepared to obtain information on which of the two barriers
is due to the rotation of the aryl and which one is related to the
ring inversion. In compound 16, the aryl rotational barrier
is much higher, and the ambient temperature spectrum shows diastereotopic
signals for CH2 (Figure S12 in the Supporting Information). On lowering the temperature, each
diastereotopic signal broadens again and splits into two sets of diastereotopic
signals below −70 °C, with a diastereomeric ratio of 61:39
(Figure S19 in the Supporting Information). This dynamic process must be assigned to the ring inversion, and
the different diastereotopic ratio is a consequence of the higher
steric hindrance exerted by chlorine with respect to fluorine. The
experimental energy barrier was 9.5 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1, in agreement to the smallest barrier observed for compound 15. The higher barrier observed for 15 (11.1
kcal mol–1) has therefore to be assigned to the o-fluorophenyl rotation.

Carbonyl Compounds
As a last structural change, we
prepared some carbonyl analogues (compounds 18–22) to investigate the effects of the exocyclic heteroatom on the rotational
barrier. From a theoretical point of view, the steric size of the
carbonyl should be very similar to that of the E-stereoisomer
of the imine. In the case of the five-membered rings (compounds 18–20), the aryl rotational barriers are indeed very
close to the corresponding imino compounds (R = Me, Cl, and NO2), with differences lying just above the experimental error
(±0.2 kcal/mol). On the contrary, in the case of the six- and
seven-membered rings (compounds 21 and 22, respectively), the rotational energy difference is about 2 kcal
mol–1 higher than the imino compounds.

DFT
calculations suggest that the geometry of the threshold TS (Figure
S24 middle in the Supporting Information) in compound 21 is higher in energy and different in
geometry with respect to the TS of compound 12. In compound 21, the o-chlorine atom is located over CH2 in position 6 of the ring, and the two rings are almost coplanar.
In compound 12, the aryl ring is in a pseudo-axial position
and the chlorine is on the side of the C=NH moiety. The difference
is due to the lower double-bond character of the amidine moiety with
respect to the amide. This difference is confirmed by the observation
of a lower C–N rotational barrier in N,N-dimethylacetamidine with respect to N,N-dimethylacetamide.23 The same effect can be invoked to explain the larger barrier of 22 with respect to 16 (Figure S24 in the Supporting Information). On the contrary, the
smaller five-membered ring (e.g., compound 5 vs 19) is more rigid and does not allow the aryl ring to bend
out of the ring plane, thus the steric effect of the imino is similar
to that of the carbonyl. DFT calculations confirmed that the geometries
of both TS have the chlorine close to CH2 in position 5
(Figure S24 in the Supporting Information). As observed for compound 16, the low-temperature
NMR spectra of compound 22 showed the presence of two
diastereomeric conformations because of the ring inversion, with an
energy barrier at the coalescence point of 9.7 ± 0.2 kcal mol–1, very similar to that observed for compound 16.

Conclusions
We investigated the
conformational dynamics of 1-aryl-2-iminoazacycloalkanes
on increasing the ring size from five to seven members. The N-aryl rotational barrier was found to be driven by the
steric size of the ortho substituent, and the barrier
increases by about 5 kcal mol–1 when changing the
ring size from five to six and seven members. The E/Z interconversion barrier of the imino moiety was
measured as 6.9 kcal mol–1 in compound 4. Two conformational diastereoisomers, generated by ring inversion,
were observed in the case of the seven-membered rings, with an energy
barrier of 9.5 kcal mol–1. A comparison with some
carbonyl analogues showed very similar N-aryl rotational
barriers for the five-membered rings and slightly higher barriers
for the larger rings.

Experimental Section
Spectroscopic Data
NMR spectra were recorded using
a spectrometer operating at a field of 14.4 T (600 MHz for 1H, 150.8 for 13C). Chemical shifts are reported in ppm
(δ) relative to tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. D2O was employed to confirm exchangeable protons (ex). Splitting
multiplicities are reported as singlet (s), broad signal (bs), doublet
(d), double doublet (dd), triplet (t), quartet (q), heptet (h), and
multiplet (m). The assignment of the 13C signals was obtained
by means of DEPT, gs-HSQC, and gs-HMBC spectra. The 150.8 MHz 13C spectra were acquired under proton decoupling conditions
with a 36 000 Hz spectral width, 5.5 μs (60° tip
angle) pulse width, 1 s acquisition time, and 9 s delay time. The
long relaxation time was needed to observe some quaternary carbons
of the heterocycle. A line broadening function of 1–2 Hz was
applied before the Fourier transformation. 1D-EXSY spectra were obtained
at 600 MHz using the DPFGSE sequence24 and
a 50 Hz wide selective pulse with a R–SNOB shape.25 High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) was
performed with an ESI-QTOF spectrometer. Reagents, solvents, and starting
materials were purchased from standard sources and purified according
to literature procedures. Melting points were determined with a Büchi
capillary apparatus and are uncorrected. Variable-temperature NMR
spectra were recorded as previously reported.26 The rate constants were derived from line shape simulations (QCPE
DNMR6 program),27 and the free energies
of activation (ΔG⧧) were
obtained by means of the Eyring equation. Within the experimental
uncertainty, the latter values were found essentially invariant in
the examined temperature range, thus implying an almost negligible
activation entropy ΔS⧧.15

Calculations
The ground-state and
transition-state
geometries were obtained using the Gaussian 09 rev D.01 series of
programs,28 with standard optimization
parameters. The calculations employed the M06-2X hybrid-DFT functional29 and the 6-311+G(d,p) basis set. Vibrational
analysis was performed to validate the ground states (zero imaginary
frequencies) and the transition states (one imaginary frequency).
Visual inspection of the corresponding normal mode30 confirmed the identification of the correct transition
states.

chromatography, the mixture was treated with ethyl ether (50 mL) and
water (10 mL). The aqueous phase was separated and extracted with
ethyl ether (30 mL). The combined organic layers were dried over anhydrous

The high temperature spectra were obtained
in DMF-d7 or DMSO-d6. The use of an high-boiling chlorinated solvent
similar to CD2Cl2 would have been preferable.
However, we could not use 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane-d2 because at
high temperatures the compounds react causing removal of DCl.


1D-EXSY were
obtained
by the DPFGSE-NOE sequence using an array of short mixing times. See: Lunazzi L. ; Mancinelli M. ; Mazzanti A.
