The highly thermally
and chemically stable imidazole framework
ZIF-8 samples were separately postmodified with amine groups by using N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (MMEN)
and N,N-dimethylaminoethylamine
(MAEA), which had the same molecular formula but different structures.
The modified ZIF-8 samples (ZIF-8@amine) were thoroughly characterized,
including powder X-ray diffractometry, Fourier-transformed infrared
spectroscopy, and physical adsorption at 77 K by nitrogen, thermogravimetric
analysis, and photophysical characterization. Results showed that
after modification, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface
area and total pore volume both increased, almost one time higher
than those of the original ZIF-8 sample, and followed the order: ZIF-8-MMEN
> ZIF-8-MAEA > ZIF-8. Furthermore, the N–H group was
successfully
grafted into the modified ZIF-8 samples. To examine the sensing properties
of the modified ZIF-8@amine samples toward the breath biomarkers of
lung cancer, five potential volatile organic compound biomarkers were
used as analytes. ZIF-8-MMEN and ZIF-8-MAEA revealed a unique capacity
for sensing hexanal, ethylbenzene, and 1-propanol with high efficiency
and sensitivity. The three samples all did not show sensing ability
toward styrene and isoprene. In addition, ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA
all can sense hexanal with a detection limit as low as 1 ppb.

==== Body
Introduction
Nowadays,
periodic computed tomography and bronchoscopy, which
are based upon invasive procedures accompanied by the culture of the
pathogen are the principle techniques used for lung cancer.1−3 Compared to these traditional methods, analysis of exhaled breath
has shown increasing potential to provide a highly informative, specific,
and noninvasive alternative diagnostic tool. Volatile organic compounds
(VOCs) and other low molecular weight compounds (such as carbon monoxide
and ammonia) can supply a fingerprint of metabolic products and can
be released by various bodily routes, such as through skin, urine,
and breath. Currently, exhaled breath VOCs have been extensively studied
for pollutant exposure and disease diagnosis.2,4−7

Lung cancer is the foremost cause of cancer-related deaths,
causing
approximately 1.8 million fatal casualties per year worldwide. The
danger arrives from the unrestrainable nature of abnormal cells that
begin in one or both lungs and are prone to spread to other parts
of the human body rapidly. Monitoring of specific cancer biomarkers
present in the exhaled VOCs is of particular interest for human safety
and quality of life because of the severity of lung cancer. Many early
lung cancers are curable, and the cure rate of orthotopic lung cancer
in situ is close to 100%. Nevertheless, the 5-year survival rate after
surgical resection of stage III patients is only 5–20% while
stage I patients was up to 60–90%. Therefore, if proper methods
for early-stage disease diagnosis can be found, especially by developing
novel material-based breath sensor approaches with highly selective
and ultrasensitive capabilities,8−14 biomarker monitoring can be greatly improved. However, the screening
of lung cancer breath biomarkers has still been a challenge because
of the absence of unified sampling and analyzing methods, small sample
size, and individual differences in patients. Saalberg and Wolff15 reviewed the recent studies (/publications from
1985 to 2015) on VOCs which were considered lung cancer biomarkers
for breath analysis diagnosis and concluded that the six most frequently
emerging biomarkers were 2-butanone, 1-propanol, isoprene, ethylbenzene,
styrene, and hexanal. For the purpose of looking at the fingerprint
of breath VOCs of patients with lung cancer, various types of electronic
noses have been used for breath VOC detection.16−20 Among the previous studies, many gas sensor systems
have been applied to lung cancer diagnosis using breath gas detection,10,21−23 such as polymer/carbon composites,17 surface acoustic wave gas sensors,24 quartz crystal microbalance gas sensors,25 conducting polymer gas sensors,26 colorimetric
sensor arrays,27 and metal oxide gas sensors.28 Nevertheless, although many efforts have been
done to develop novel sensors, a more practical, robust technology
for early diagnosis of lung cancer is still nonexistent today.

Because many recent research studies have focused on high mobility,
as well as low cost, and low power solutions to the trace breath VOCs,
the development and application of sensing materials or composites
have become a hot issue with considerable research interest. Metal–organic
frameworks (MOFs) have been proved to be an appropriate candidate
for a variety of biosensing systems because of their remarkable physical–chemical
properties and infinite network structures which can be directly self-assembled
through the coordination of metal ions/clusters with organic linkers.29−34 MOFs exhibit many interesting characteristics such as high specific
surface areas, small crystal density, various types, adjustable pore
size, and tunable internal surfaces. These properties make MOFs be
extensively explored in applications such as gas storage,31,33−38 separation,39,40 catalysis,41,42 drug delivery,43,44 and chemical sensors45−51 over the past decades. Especially, MOFs have inherent advantages
to be fluorescent sensors for the detection and recognition of various
small molecules, anions, cations, and VOCs as well based upon their
fluorescence response.

In spite of many advantages, MOFs have
also shown some drawbacks,
for example, low thermal stability
and high moisture susceptibility.52 These
shortcomings have restricted their applications in certain areas.
Postsynthetic modification strategy has been expected to modify the
pore structures and help in generating functional properties that
are not directly accessible from conventional MOF synthetic procedures
and have been demonstrated as a powerful tool for introducing specific
functional groups into MOFs.13,53−60 The postsynthetic modification retains the intact crystal structure,
nevertheless the physicochemical properties of the materials can be
altered. The various advantages of postsynthetic modification are
highlighted, which make these modification methods play a key role
in development and application of MOF materials.61 The imidazole framework ZIF-8 samples are one of the most
classic and highly stable MOFs. Since its discovery in 2002,62 it has been extensively investigated in the
areas of synthetic methods and potential applications.63−67

Herein, a postsynthetic modification strategy was used to
modify
ZIF-8 with N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine
(MMEN) and N,N-dimethylaminoethylamine
(MAEA) as the functional groups. MMEN and MAEA had the same molecular
formula but different structures, and they were introduced into the
framework of ZIF-8 samples. The modified ZIF-8-MMEN and ZIF-8-MAEA
were applied to fluorescence detection of lung cancer VOC biomarkers.
Herein, hexanal, 1-propanol, ethylbenzene, isoprene, and styrene are
chosen to be the objective breath biomarkers of lung cancer in this
study based on the former studies. As far as we know, this is the
first time that postmodified MOFs are employed as fluorescent probes
for sensing breath VOC biomarkers of lung cancer.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Zinc nitrate hexahydrate (99.9% purity) was
purchased from Alfa Chemicals. 2-Methylimidazole (98% purity), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF; 99.9% purity),
methanol (99.9% purity), MMEN (97% purity), MAEA (99% purity), and n-hexane (95% purity) were purchased from J&K Chemical.
Chloroform was purchased from Samhoo Trading Co., LTD.

Physical Methods
The FTIR spectra of the materials
were recorded using KBr pellets on a Bruker VERTEX70 spectrometer
within the range 4000–400 cm–1. The thermogravimetric
analyses (TGA) was measured with a Netzsch TG209F3-ASC TG analyzer
at a heating rate of 5 K min–1, which were carried
out under a N2 atmosphere. The power X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns were obtained on a Bruker D8 Advance automated diffractometer
for structure analysis using Cu Kα radiation (40 kV and 40 mA)
with a scan range of 2θ from 5 to 60° at a scan speed of
2°/min.

Preparation and Modification of ZIF-8 Materials
Preparation
of ZIF-8 was carried out following the reported procedures.35,67 The modification of ZIF-8 crystals was performed using the following
steps. First, 60 mL n-hexane was added to 0.5 g of
the ZIF-8 sample which was placed in a 100 mL single-mouth flask.
The flask was placed in a self-made oil bath which was placed on a
magnetic stirring vessel at 320 rad/min. Second, N,N′-dimethylethylenediamine (denoted as MMEN)
was added into the flask dropwise. After that, the condensation reflux
was conducted and the temperature of the magnetic stirring vessel
was set at 85 °C, lasting for 12 h. Finally, the mixture was
filtered and the sample was dried at 110 °C for 12 h. The modification
method of N,N-dimethylaminoethylenediamine
(denoted as MAEA) was the same as that of MMEN. The concentration
gradient of the experiments and the name of the obtained samples can
be found in Table S1. The molecular structure
of MMEN and MAEA are depicted in Figure 1. In the study, the MMEN-modified samples
with different concentrations were named ZIF-8-MMEN1, ZIF-8-MMEN2,
.... The MAEA-modified samples with different concentrations were
named ZIF-8-MAEA-1, ZIF-8-MAEA-2, .... The modified samples, which
were used for the fluorescence study, were the best among all the
samples, and they were named ZIF-8-MMEN and ZIF-8-MAEA, respectively.

Pore Structure Analysis
An autosorb IQ2 gas
adsorption analyzer equipped with commercial software of calculation
and analysis was used to characterize the specific surface area and
pore volume of the ZIF-8 and modified ZIF-8 materials. Prior to measurement
of the N2 adsorption–desorption experiments, the
ZIF-8 samples were degassed at 150 °C for 10 h. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) and Langmuir specific surface area were calculated from the
isotherms using the BET and Langmuir equations, respectively. The
total pore volume was calculated through converting the adsorption
amount at p/p0 to a volume
of liquid adsorbate, and the micropore volume was calculated by using
the t-plot method of Lippens and de Boer to the adsorption
data. Finally, the pore size distribution was determined by the density
functional theory (DFT) equation.

Fluorescence Experiment
The fluorescence properties
of the modified ZIF-8 samples were examined in the solid state in
organic solvent suspensions. The photoluminescence excitation and
emission spectra were recorded using a Hitachi F-7000 spectrophotometer.
A 150 W xenon lamp was equipped as the excitation source. Prior to
the measurements, the solid ZIF-8-modified samples were ground into
powder and used for sensing experiments. Powder samples (6 mg) of
ZIF-8, ZIF-8@MMEN, and ZIF-8@MAEA were dispersed into 3 mL hexanal,
styrene, isoprene, 1-propanol, and ethylbenzene, respectively. Suspensions
were treated with ultrasonication for 5 min prior to fluorescence
measurements.

Results and Discussion
PXRD of the Modified ZIF-8
Samples
Figure 2 presents the powder X-ray
single-diffraction (PXRD) patterns of the modified ZIF-8@MMEN and
ZIF-8@MAEA samples. As it can be seen from Figure 2, the main peaks of the modified ZIF-8 materials
match very well with the ZIF-8 sample, revealing that the modified
ZIF-8 samples with different concentrations of MMEN and MAEA maintain
integrated well after the modification. Furthermore, the main peaks
of the original ZIF-8 material match well with the simulated XRD pattern
of the ZIF-8 crystal.62

Textural Properties
Figure 3a,c presents the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms on the ZIF-8 and the modified samples. It can be noted that
the N2 isotherms on the modified samples all are of type-I
isotherms, illustrating that there are mainly micropores in the modified
ZIF-8 samples. Figure 3b,d shows the pore size distribution profiles of the modified ZIF-8
samples, calculated using the DFT. It was noted that the average pore
size of ZIF-8 as made was mainly distributed at 10.868 Å; however,
after modification, the average pore size of the modified samples
obviously decreased. For ZIF-8-MAEA samples, the pore size were mainly
distributed at 9.26 Å, while the average pore size of ZIF-8-MMEN
was distributed at 8.89 Å. The decreased pore size was because
of the steric hindrance effect causing by the introduction of the
N–H group from MMEN and MAEA.

isotherms on the ZIF-8 sample as made and ZIF-8-MAEA samples. (d)

The textural properties obtained from the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherms are summarized in Table 1. It can be found that the micropore volume and total
pore volume of the modified samples were much larger than those of
the original ZIF-8, indicating that the guest molecules were removed
completely and formation of new pores. After modification with MMEN,
the BET surface area and Langmuir surface area both obviously increased,
and followed the order: ZIF-8-MMEN2 > ZIF-8-MMEN1> ZIF-8-MMEN3
> ZIF-8.
The total pore volume of the MMEN-modified samples obviously increased,
almost one time higher than that of the original sample, and they
followed the order: ZIF-8-MMEN1 > ZIF-8-MMEN2 > ZIF-8-MMEN3
> ZIF-8.
After the concentration of MMEN reached a specific value, the BET
surface area are basically the same, indicating that the modifications
reached saturation. For the ZIF-8-MAEA samples, the BET surface area
and total pore volume all increased notably, following the order:
ZIF-8-MAEA2 > ZIF-8-MAEA3 > ZIF-8-MAEA1 > ZIF-8. Interestingly,
it
can be noted that the BET surface area and total volume of ZIF-8-MAEA3
and ZIF-8-MAEA1 were very close. The pore structure parameters of
modified samples by MAEA show a trend of increasing first and then
decreasing. Above all, although MMEN and MAEA have the same molecular
formula, but the steric hindrance resulting from the straight chain
of MMEN is much smaller than that from the branch chain of MAEA. Furthermore,
the dramatically increased micropore volume and total pore volume
of ZIF-8-MMEN and ZIF-8-MAEA samples can be ascribed to the removed
guest molecules and formation of new pores with the introduction of
N–H groups. Thereafter, the ZIF-8-MMEN2 and ZIF-8-MAEA2 can
be regarded as the two best samples among the modified samples, and
they would be denoted as ZIF-8-MMEN and ZIF-8-MAEA, respectively,
in the following fluorescence sensing experiments.

FTIR Characterization of
Modified ZIF-8 Materials
Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectra
of the modified ZIF-8 materials. As it can be noted, the characteristic
peaks of the modified ZIF-8-MMEN were slightly different from original
ZIF-8 in that: (1) the peak at 3134 cm–1 which was
assigned to the band of N–H was more pronounced on modified
ZIF-8 than those on the original ZIF-8 samples, indicating that the
N–H group was introduced into ZIF-8 successfully; (2) the peak
that appeared at 2930 cm–1 was more evident and
it can be attributed to −CH2 antisymmetric stretching
vibration for the modified samples; (3) two peaks of ZIF-8-MMEN1 and
ZIF-8-MMEN2 observed at 2963 cm–1 were more evident
which was related to the antisymmetric stretching vibration of −CH3 introduced by modification of MMEN; (4) the spectrum of ZIF-8-MMEN3
also revealed the formation of a new peak at 2972 cm–1 because of −CH3 stretching vibration. For the
ZIF-8@MAEA samples, there were two main differences as shown in Figure 4c and Figure 4d. First, it can be found that
the N–H stretching vibration peak at 3136 cm–1 after modification was obviously enhanced, and the peak intensity
increased with the increase of the concentration of MAEA, indicating
that the N–H bond was successfully introduced into ZIF-8. Second,
the −CH2 antisymmetric stretching vibration peak
at 2930 cm–1 was more evident than before. Thereafter,
the N–H groups was successfully introduced into the modified
ZIF-8 samples with MMEN and MAEA.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
Figure S1 shows the thermogravimetric profiles of the modified ZIF-8
samples. The weight loss of the modified ZIF-8 samples was also listed
in Tables S2 and S3. It can be noted that
there were two distinct weight loss steps. The first step of ZIF-8
was corresponded to the loss of guest molecules, and the second weight
loss step was because of the collapse of frameworks. For the first
stage of modified ZIF-8 samples, the weight loss was attributed to
release of guest molecules and introduced groups. During the second
stage, the weight loss was mainly ascribed to decomposition of frameworks.
The initial temperature of the first stage of ZIF-8@MAEA samples was
lower than that of ZIF-8, indicating that the thermal stability was
slightly decreased after MAEA modification. However, the initial temperature
of the first stage of the ZIF-8@MMEN sample was higher than that of
the ZIF-8 sample, indicating that MMEN modification can enhance the
thermal stability of the samples.

Fluorescent Performance
The fluorescence of original
ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA have been used for sensing the potential
biomarkers of lung cancer patients (i.e., hexanal, styrene, isoprene,
1-propanol, and ethylbenzene) bearing electron-donating or -withdrawing
groups, which can quench or enhance the fluorescence of ZIF-8. To
demonstrate the applicability of the modified ZIF-8 crystals for sensing
VOCs, the modified ZIF-8 samples were activated by vacuum at 100 °C
for 6 h and then soaked at room temperature in various liquid VOCs. Figure 5 presents the fluorescence
intensity changes of ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA when exposed
to the potential biomarkers of lung cancer patients (hexanal, ethylbenzene,
and 1-propanol). As it was noted, in comparison with ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN
and ZIF-8-MAEA showed turn-off effects toward hexanal and ethylbenzene,
while they all illustrated turn-on effects toward 1-propanol. This
may be because of the fact that the transfer of electrons from the
electron-donating framework to high electron deficiency one can occur
upon excitation, causing fluorescence quenching. For the other two
VOC biomarkers of lung cancer patients, styrene and isoprene, there
was no fluorescence for ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA. Table 2 lists the changes
in fluorescence intensity and emission frequency shift of ZIF-8 and
the modified ZIF-8 samples toward the selected VOCs. Interestingly,
an emission frequency shift can be noticed for both ZIF-8-MMEN and
ZIF-8-MAEA toward hexanal and ethylbenzene. This is because of the
fact that after the introduction of the N–H group, the binding
affinity between the analytes and the frameworks became much stronger.
The strong binding affinity may be responsible for the emission frequency
shift.68 As other references have been
stated, this property is very appealing and useful as far as signal
transduction is concerned: the evolution of peak placement at a specific
wavelength is easily tracked and monitored, such as hexanal and ethylbenzene.

Furthermore, the fluorescence detection experiments
of the modified
ZIF-8 samples were performed to examine the sensing sensitivity to
a series of hexanal. To examine the sensing sensitivity toward hexanal
in more details, a batch of suspensions of the modified ZIF-8 samples
were prepared by dispersing them in a DMF solution, meanwhile gradually
increasing the contents to monitor the emissive response. The fluorescence
intensities increase with an increase of the concentration of the
hexanal added to DMF, indicating that the detection limit of hexanal
on all the three samples were lower than 1 ppb as seen from Figure 6.

concentrations of hexanal. (Ex = 387 nm). (c) Emission spectra of
ZIF-8-MAEA sample in different concentrations of hexanal. (Ex = 387

Regeneration Ability
Besides high sensitivity and a
low detection limit, regeneration ability is another crucial factor
in the performance of sensors. To study the recyclability of the modified
ZIF-8 samples, the synthesized ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA were
regenerated in vacuum at 100 °C for 6 h after exposure to hexanal.
Remarkably, it was observed that the fluorescence intensities of ZIF-8,
ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA were regenerated completely (Figure 7), and the emission intensities
of these three samples almost maintain its original intensity even
after four cycles of exposure to hexanal and vacuum treatment at 100
°C, suggesting a high reversibility of the modified ZIF-8 samples
for potential applications. The PXRD patterns of the recovered ZIF-8
sample after four cycles showed no change compared to those of the
as-synthesized samples and simulated patterns, indicating high stability
of the framework (Figure S2). The good
regeneration ability of the modified ZIF-8 samples illustrates the
feasibility toward the detection of breath biomarkers of lung cancer.

Conclusions
The ZIF-8 crystals were modified by postsynthetic
methods by introducing
MMEN and MAEA into pores. After modification, the BET surface area
and pore volume were both increased obviously. Especially, the BET
surface area and total pore volume of the ZIF-8-MMEN sample were both
almost one time higher than that of the ZIF-8 sample as made. Although,
MMEN and MAEA has the same molecular formula, the modified ZIF-8-MMEN
and ZIF-8-MAEA samples showed different fluorescence properties toward
the selected potential biomarkers of lung cancer patients because
of the steric hindrance effects. In comparison with ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN
and ZIF-8-MAEA showed turn-off effects toward hexanal and ethylbenzene,
while they all illustrated turn-on effects toward 1-propanol. This
may be because of the fact that the transfer of electron from the
electron-donating framework to high electron deficiency can occur
upon excitation, causing fluorescence quenching. However, for the
other two VOC biomarkers of lung cancer patients, styrene and isoprene,
there was no fluorescence for ZIF-8, ZIF-8-MMEN, and ZIF-8-MAEA. For
the fluorescence sensitivity toward hexanal, the fluorescence intensities
increase with an increase of the concentration of the hexanal added
to DMF, and the detection limit of hexanal on all the three samples
were lower than 1 ppb. Moreover, the modified ZIF-8 samples all showed
good reproducibility.
