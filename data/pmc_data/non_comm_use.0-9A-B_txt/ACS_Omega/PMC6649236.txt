Photon
upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC)
is a process that converts two lower-energy photons to a higher-energy
photon, which is expected to increase the maximum solar cell efficiency
beyond the Shockley–Queisser limit. To incorporate TTA-UC into
a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC), we used a co-adsorption approach,
in which both a TTA-UC donor with an alkyl carboxylic acid chain and
a TTA-UC acceptor dye were adsorbed onto mesoporous TiO2. Incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency spectra and excitation
intensity dependence indicated that a photocurrent was generated under
irradiation at wavelengths above 490 nm by the TTA-UC mechanism. The
power-conversion efficiency of the DSSC was increased to 0.72%, and
the photocurrent contributed by TTA-UC was 0.036 mA cm–2 under 1 sun irradiation.

1 Introduction
Photon
upconversion via triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA-UC)
is a process whereby two lower-energy photons are converted to a higher-energy
photon. Upconversion is an excellent strategy for solar applications
because higher-energy photons can be generated with a low-intensity
noncoherent light source, such as sunlight.1,2 In
the solar cell field, it is anticipated that the maximum solar cell
efficiency will exceed the Shockley–Queisser limit.3−5 Among them, the application of TTA-UC technology is expected to
greatly contribute to the improvement of the efficiency of dye-sensitized
solar cells (DSSCs).6 The DSSCs require
the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the
dye to be higher than the energy of the conduction band edge of TiO2, while the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy
of the dye must be lower than the redox potential of the redox agent.
The maximum voltage is the difference between the conduction band
edge of TiO2 and the redox potential of the redox agent.
The trade-off of increasing the maximum voltage is that the spectral
response corresponding to the difference between the HOMO and the
LUMO remains unchanged.

One strategy for integrating TTA-UC
into DSSCs is to use TTA-UC
as a filter or reflector in existing solar cells.7,8 In
such a system, however, there is a significant loss of light before
it reaches the dyes. This is due to self-absorption, reflection, and
scattering of the used glass substrate. The strategy of directly incorporating
TTA-UC into photocurrent generation in solar cells has been studied
as a means of bypassing the parasitic absorption problem.9−14 In a report by Simpson et al., the triplet acceptor molecule in
a DSSC was adsorbed on TiO2 and used as the sensitizing
dye, while the triplet donor molecule was dissolved in the electrolyte.9 In addition, Ahmad et al. assembled a photoelectrochemical
device that incorporated a metal–organic framework, a triplet
acceptor molecule adsorbed onto TiO2, and a triplet donor
molecule dissolved in an electrolyte.10 In the power-conversion mechanism of the homogeneous device, the
energy from low-energy photons is transferred from the triplet donor
molecule in the electrolyte to the triplet acceptor molecule on TiO2, and a high-energy photon is generated by triplet–triplet
annihilation (TTA). In contrast, DSSCs in which both the triplet acceptor
and the donor are present as self-assembled multilayers on TiO2 have been devised.11−14 In these DSSCs, sensitizer molecules are coordinated
to surface-bound acceptor molecules via metal-ion linkages. These
devices exhibit higher photocurrents and better overall efficiency
than heterogeneous devices. This approach circumvents the problem
of limited triplet-donor solubility in the electrolyte.

In this
work, we introduce a co-adsorption approach based on previous
reports of Morandeira and co-workers. The TTA-UC donor, Pt(II)–porphyrin
dye with an attached carboxylic alkyl chain spacer (PtTPO), and the
acceptor, diphenylanthracene dye (ADDA), are both adsorbed on mesoporous
TiO2. In this co-adsorption approach, it is expected to
improve the efficiency of the triplet energy transfer and triplet–triplet
annihilation (TTA) due to shorter distances between the co-adsorbed
TTA-UC donor and acceptor in addition to solving the solubility problem.
The co-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode exhibits efficient photon-to-electron
conversion integrated TTA-UC. A schematic of the TTA-UC molecules
co-adsorbed on TiO2 is shown in Figure 1a. The proposed power-generation mechanism
begins with excitation of the donor molecule. Following the intersystem
crossing to the triplet excited state, triplet energy is transferred
from the donor molecule to the acceptor molecule via Dexter energy
transfer.15,16 The triplet excited state then migrates
through the acceptor until two triplet acceptors in close enough proximity
are annihilated. One acceptor returns to the ground state and the
other is promoted to the singlet excited state. In fact, TTA-UC on
the metal-oxide ZrO2, which has surface properties that
are comparable to those of TiO2, has been reported.17−19 Its conduction band is approximately 1.3 eV higher than that of
TiO2. Thus, TTA-UC fluorescence can be achieved by eliminating
the possibility of electron injection from the singlet excited state
of the acceptor into the semiconductor.17 In this study, an alkyl chain molecular spacer was introduced between
the dye and the TiO2 anchor to prevent the quenching of
PtTPO by electron injection and energy transfer into TiO2. When an alkyl chain spacer was employed for a DSSC in which a light-harvesting
dye was applied to TiO2, electron injection from the donor
molecules into TiO2 was prevented, and Förster resonant
energy transfer from the light-harvesting dyes to the sensitizing
dyes was allowed to occur.20,21

and ADDA/PtTPO (10:1) adsorbed on TiO2 film.

It has been suggested
that a molecular spacer might also be useful
for triplet energy transfer from a porphyrin derivative to an anthracene
derivative.22 The acceptor molecule in
the singlet excited state would then inject electrons into the conduction
band of TiO2 to generate a photocurrent. In this co-adsorbed
configuration, ADDA acts as a TiO2-sensitizing dye. Photons
are converted to electrons, which are then injected by ADDA in the
excited state into the conduction band of TiO2.

2 Results and Discussion
ADDA–TiO2 and
PtTPO–TiO2 electrodes
were prepared by immersion for 1 day in solutions of the respective
dyes. An ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1) electrode (10:1
means of concentration ratio of dyes in the TiO2 electrode
immersion solution) was fabricated by immersion in a solution containing
1 mM ADDA and 0.1 mM PtTPO for 1 day. The absorption spectra, obtained
via UV–vis spectroscopy, of the PtTPO–TiO2 electrode showed two characteristic peaks, referred to as the Soret
band and the Q band. The absorption spectrum of the ADDA–TiO2 electrode was similar to the absorption spectrum of ADDA
in solution (Figure S1). The absorption
spectra of the TiO2 electrode with co-adsorbed ADDA and
PtTPO contained peaks that overlapped with those of both ADDA and
PtTPO, indicating the two dyes co-adsorbed on the TiO2 electrode.

DSSCs were assembled with stained TiO2 photoanodes,
Pt counter electrodes held together with Surlyn thermoforming film,
and acetonitrile containing 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium
iodide (DMPII), 0.1 M Lil, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) as the electrolyte solution. The
electrolyte solution was injected through a hole drilled into the
counter electrode. The photocurrent density–voltage (J–V) curves obtained under AM 1.5G
(100 mW cm–2) simulated solar irradiation are shown
in Figure 2. The incident
photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra shown in Figure 3 were collected to
evaluate the DSSC photovoltaic performance under monochromatic light.
The DSSC made with only the PtTPO-sensitizing molecule was very weakly
IPCE, as illustrated by the red line in Figure 3. This indicated that the alkyl chain prevented
electron injection from PtTPO into the conduction band of TiO2.

(IPCE) spectra
of DSSCs based on TiO2 (black), ADDA–TiO2 (blue), PtTPO–TiO2 (red), and ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (green).

The short-circuit current
density (JSC) measured in the DSSC based
on ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1), indicated by the green
line in Figure 2, was
higher than those of the ADDA–TiO2 and PtTPO–TiO2 DSSCs. The power-conversion
efficiency of the DSSC with co-adsorbed ADDA and PtTPO increased to
0.72%. In this device, the IPCE decreased in the spectral range of
300–400 nm, which was the region of absorption by ADDA and
PtTPO as indicated by their Soret bands. The decline in the IPCE between
300 and 400 nm was due to the decreasing amounts of adsorbed ADDA,
as shown Table 1, as
well as absorption competition between ADDA and PtTPO.

b Quantities of the adsorbed dyes
were determined by absorbance spectroscopy with alkaline solutions
containing desorbed dyes from the stained TiO2 electrodes.

c PCE was measured under AM 1.5G
irradiation
(100 mW cm–2).

d DSSCs were fabricated with an electrolyte
consisting of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium iodide (DMPII),
0.1 M Lil, 0.05 M I2, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in MeCN.

e JUC was
determined by subtracting the photocurrent of PtTPO from that of ADDA/PtTPO
under AM 1.5G irradiation with a 490 nm long-pass filter.

In contrast, IPCE was enhanced in
the spectral range from 500 to
550 nm, shown by the green line in Figure 3, which matched the absorption range of the
PtTPO Q-band. However, the increase in the IPCE between 500 and 550
nm could not be solely attributed to electron injection from PtTPO
to the conduction band of TiO2. The PtTPO–TiO2-based DSSC was very weakly powered, and the ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 cell contained less adsorbed PtTPO than the PtTPO–TiO2 cell (Table 1). This indicated that ADDA/PtTPO co-adsorbed on TiO2 generated
a photocurrent by electron injection following photon conversion by
TTA-UC. The prevailing figure of merit, JUC,4,23 was 0.036 mA cm–2 sun–2 for ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1) owing to upconversion
under illumination of 1 sun. This JUC was
comparable to those of the TTA-UC-incorporated DSSCs fabricated with
other approaches.23

Further support
for TTA-UC photocurrent generation was obtained
when we examined the dependence of the photocurrent on the excitation
intensity in the DSSC employing the ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1) electrode (Figure 4). The photocurrent was measured with a source meter under
a solar simulator using a Xe lamp with a 490 nm long-pass filter to
excite only the PtTPO as light-harvesting dyes on TiO2.
Each intensity was measured with a Si photodiode.

Figure 4 Excitation intensity
dependence spectra of DSSC photocurrent densities
with respect to excitation intensities under an AM 1.5G solar simulator
for ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2. A Xe lamp with a 490 nm long-pass
filter was used for ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2.

It is well established that TTA-UC exhibits anti-Stokes
fluorescence,
for which intensities can vary between quadratic and linear with respect
to excitation power when a noncoherent light source is used. Such
a behavior is reflected in a change in slope from 2 at low intensity
to 1 at high intensity, which is a clear indicator of a TTA-UC process.24−26 Photocurrents derived from TTA-UC also exhibit a change in slope.10−14 In Figure 4, the
photocurrent of the DSSC made with ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1) exhibited increases along two straight lines with slopes
of 1.5 and 1.0 that bordered around 7 mW cm–2. On
the other hand, the photocurrent of ADDA–TiO2 exhibited
a linear dependence under an AM 1.5G solar simulator. This is to be
expected for a single-dyephotoexcitation-electron injection process,
which is observed with standard DSSCs. The shift in Figure 4 from quasi-quadratic to supralinear
dependence indicated that the photocurrent observed at wavelengths
longer than 490 nm was generated by the TTA-UC mechanism. The border
between the two ranges, which is known as Ith,27 ideally occurs below a solar intensity
of 1 sun in solar cells.14 In the DSSC
demonstrated here, Ith occurred below
this irradiation intensity. Under a light intensity of 1 sun, detection
occurred at 76.9 mW cm–2 when the 490 nm long-pass
filter was used.

Moreover, stained TiO2 photoanodes
at four different
ADDA-to-PtTPO ratios were prepared by immersing TiO2 electrodes
in solutions containing different ADDA concentrations and a constant
concentration of PtTPO. Absorption measurements were made with the
photoanodes (Figure S2). The dyes were
then desorbed from the photoanodes into solutions, which were analyzed
by UV–vis spectroscopy, and the concentration ratios of the
dyes were determined from the absorbance data. The J–V curves and IPCE spectra (Figures S3 and S4) were obtained for the fabricated DSSCs.
The PCE, JUC, and concentration ratios
of the adsorbed dyes are summarized in Table 1. The highest PCE was observed in the DSSCs
with ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1). In the ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2 (10:1) electrode, the quantities of the adsorbed ADDA and
PtTPO were 58 and 8 nmol cm–2, respectively.

Efficient upconversion via TTA in solution requires about 100 times
more triplet acceptors than donors.27 In
the devices that exhibited the maximum PCE and JUC values in this study, the quantity of ADDA triplet acceptors
was about 7.25 times greater than that of the donor, PtTPO. In mesoporous
ZrO2 films with co-adsorbed derivatives of platinum porphyrin
and diphenylanthracene, the maximum UC emission intensity was observed
when the quantity of sensitizers exceeded that of the emitters 10-fold.18 The TTA-UC system in this case did not require
100 times more acceptors than donors. In fact, the IPCE in the DSSC
we fabricated with 20:1 ADDA/PtPTO–TiO2 was lower
in the spectral range from 500 to 550 nm than the IPCE in the DSSC
made with 10:1 ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2.

In contrast,
the IPCE at ∼515 nm was negligible in the DSSC
made with 1:10 ADDA/PtTPO–TiO2. Its IPCE at 515
nm was about the same as that of the DSSC made with PtTPO–TiO2. This may have been due to the nonradiative decay from the
ADDA triplet state prior to TTA. The transferred triplet electron
would quench without TTA because the likelihood of one excited ADDA
molecule being close enough to another excited ADDA molecule for TTA-UC
to occur would be small. This was because PtTPO was present in a much
greater quantity than ADDA. Consequently, the photocurrent at 515
nm was negligible, even though two dyes were present on the TiO2 electrode.

3 Conclusions
We have
demonstrated the co-adsorption of a TTA-UC donor containing
an alkyl carboxylic acid chain (PtTPO) and an acceptor (ADDA) on mesoporous
TiO2 to integrate TTA-UC into a DSSC. The DSSC based on
our co-adsorbed TiO2 photoanode was able to exhibit photocurrent
by electron injection derived from TTA-UC under 1 sun (AM 1.5G) irradiation.
Overall, the power-conversion efficiency of the DSSC with co-adsorbed
ADDA and PtTPO was increased to 0.72%, and the photocurrent contributed
by TTA-UC, JUC, was 0.036 mA cm–2. This photocurrent was comparable to that of other TTA-UC DSSCs.
The IPCE spectra and excitation intensity dependence analysis indicated
that the photocurrent under irradiation at wavelengths of >490
nm
was generated through the TTA-UC mechanism. However, our device is
still insufficient in terms of photon-to-electron efficiency when
compared to other DSSCs. A molecular design that overcomes this insufficiency
may be a breakthrough for improving the efficiency of the integrated
TTA-UC DSSCs.

reaction progress was monitored by changes in the Soret and Q-bands
characteristic of the free-base porphyrin reactant and the metalloporphyrin
product. After workup, the reaction mixture was evaporated, and then
the product was collected as an orange solid.

4.5 Device Fabrication
Double-layered
nanocrystalline TiO2 photoanodes were prepared by coating
two different nanocrystalline TiO2 pastes (Solaronix, T/SP,
particle size: 20 nm and R/SP, particle size 400 nm). The transparent
nanocrystalline TiO2 paste was coated onto fluorine-doped
SnO2 (FTO) conducting glass plates by screen printing at
the size of 4 mm × 4 mm, and the electrodes were sintered at
500 °C for 30 min in air. The electrodes were treated in 40 mM
TiCl4 aqueous solution at 70 °C for 30 min and washed
with water. And then, the light-scattering layer was screen-printed
onto the transparent layer and sintered again in the same way as before.
The thickness of the TiO2 film is 12 μm (9 μm
transparent layer and 3 μm scattering layer), according to the
measurement with SURFCOM 1400D (Accretech, Tokyo Seimitsu Co., Ltd.).

The nanocrystalline TiO2 electrodes were immersed in
each dye solution (1 mM ADDA and PtTPO 0.1 mM in DMSO) for 1 day at
room temperature. The photoanode and Pt counter electrode were assembled
as a sandwich using 30 μm thick Surlyn spacer. The electrolyte
solution was introduced into the cell from predrilled hole on the
Pt counter electrode. The electrolyte consisted of 0.6 M 1,2-dimethyl-3-propylimidazolium
iodide (DMPImI), 0.05 M I2, 0.1 M LiI, and 0.5 M 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP) in acetonitrile.

4.6 Photovoltaic Measurements
The photovoltaic
performances of the fabricated solar cells were evaluated by the incident
photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and the photocurrent
density–voltage (J–V) measurements on the cells with the area of 0.16 cm2.
The IPCE spectra were recorded with S10AC system (Peccell Technologies,
Inc., Japan), and the J–V curves were recorded under AM 1.5 one sun condition (100 mW cm–2) with YSS-150A (Yamashita Denso, Japan). The light
intensity was calibrated with reference to a Si solar cell (BS-520,
Bunkokeiki Co., Ltd., Japan).
