Uses of micro-/nano-sized particles
to deliver biologically active
entities into cells are common for medical therapeutics and prophylactics
and also for cellular experiments. Enhancing cellular uptake and avoiding
destruction by lysosomes are desirable for general particulate drug
delivery systems. Here, we show that the relatively nontoxic, negatively
charged oxidized carbon black particles (OCBs) can enhance cellular
penetration of micro- and nano-particles. Experiments with retinal-grafted
chitosan particles (PRPs) with hydrodynamic sizes of 1200 ± 51.5,
540 ± 29.0, and 430 ± 11.0 nm (three-sized model particles)
indicate that only the sub-micron-sized particles can penetrate the
first layer of multilayered liposomes. However, in the presence of
OCBs, the micron-sized PRPs and the two submicron-sized PRPs can rapidly
enter the interiors of all layers of the multilayered liposomes. Very
low cellular uptakes of micro- and submicron-sized PRPs into keratinocytes
cells are usually observed. However, in the presence of OCBs, faster
and higher cellular uptakes of all of the three-sized PRPs are clearly
noticed. Intracellular traffic monitoring of PRP uptake into HepG2
cells in the presence of OCBs revealed that the PRPs did not co-localize
with endosomes, suggesting a nonendocytic uptake process. This demonstration
of OCB’s ability to enhance cellular uptake of micro- and submicron-particles
should open up an easy strategy to effectively send various carriers
into cells.

Introduction
Drug carriers in particulate
forms have been used to solve problems
on solubility, stability, and sustained release of drugs and have
been applied in both therapeutic and prophylactic purposes. The carrier
function is the delivery of various cargoes to targeted cells, and
once they reach the targeted cells, it is expected that the carriers
should be able to enter those cells and then release drug molecules
to perform the intended functions. It has been known that nanoparticles
can enter cells through active and passive processes,1,2 depending on their physical and chemical properties including size,
shape, surface charge, and surface chemistry.3−5 Some nanoparticles
can enter cells via a nonendocytic pathway (passive transport),6−9 whereas many others are taken up into cells by active transport
processes in which they have to face cellular elimination and digestion
by lysosomal pathway.10,11 Nanoparticles with very small
size and positive charge have been observed to pass through cell membranes
by generating membrane hole or membrane deformation, causing toxicity
to cells.12,13 The use of amphiphilic molecules (often
sold as transfection reagents) that can effectively disrupt phospholipid
bilayer membrane assembly and thus allowing many cargoes to pass through
the membrane is one of the popular strategy used in many in vitro
experiments to bring macromolecules, such as polynucleotides and proteins,
into cells.14,15 Differently, reports on enhancing
cellular penetration of micro-/nano-particles are mostly limited to
the use of positively charged materials to fabricate into or to decorate
onto the particles.16,17 Cell-penetrating peptides are
positively charged materials that have been used for this purpose.18−20 Nevertheless, there are numbers of carrier systems that cannot be
easily decorated with the positively charged moieties; therefore,
a simpler means to improve their cellular penetration ability is needed.
Ability to send particles into cells will allow the study on cellular
metabolism of the particles or materials. Local therapeutic applications
of carriers such as topical drug delivery or local prophylactic use,
such as vaccine antigen delivery, can also benefit from an ability
to enhance the cellular uptake of particles.

We have reported
that oxidized carbon nanoparticles (OCSs) can
interact with lipid bilayer membranes and can deliver peptide nucleic
acids to the nucleus of mammalian cells via endocytosis with endosome
leakage.21 Distinct superiority of OCSs
over oxidized carbon nanotubes and graphene oxide sheets in passing
through the phospholipid bilayer membrane has been demonstrated in
both artificial cells and real cells.22 Recently, we have also prepared new OCSs from commercially available
carbon black particles and showed that these oxidized carbon black
particles (OCBs) can directly deliver big functional proteins across
cell membranes via a nonendocytic pathway.23 Here, we report that these nonimmunogenic, relatively nontoxic OCBs
can outstandingly enhance the penetration of both micro- and submicron-sized
particles across phospholipid bilayer membranes. We also demonstrate
this finding in both artificial cells (giant liposomes) and real cells.
The work also includes intracellular traffic of the particles delivered
into cells with the aid of the OCBs.

Results and Discussion
Preparation
and Characterization of OCBs
OCBs (Supporting Information Figure S1) could be successfully
prepared by oxidizing carbon black with sodium nitrate and potassium
permanganate in strong acid, as previously described.23 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicate spherical
morphology with the size of 130 ± 29.27 nm, agreeing well with
their hydrodynamic size of 127 ± 1.35 nm obtained from dynamic
light scattering (DLS) technique. The zeta potential of the particles
in water is −34 ± 1.75 mV. Verification of the particles
was carried out by identifying functional groups of the particles
by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy
(Supporting Information Figure S2). The
particles consist of epoxy, carboxyl, and hydroxyl functional groups
and possess carbon to hydrogen to oxygen molar ratios of 1.0:0.27:0.64
as deduced from combustion-elemental analysis (see Supporting Information Figure S2 for the OCB model particle).

Retinal-Grafted Chitosan Particles
Here, we used the
PRPs having various sizes as model particles to investigate an ability
of the OCBs to bring particles into cells. We selected these particles
because of a few reasons. First, the particles are auto-fluorescent,
thus allowing us to monitor them under a confocal laser fluorescence
microscope (CLFM). Second, it has been known that chitosan is the
polymer that possesses some cellular uptake character,24,25 therefore an ability to enhance the particles made from chitosan
should demonstrate real interesting efficiency enhancement. Third,
because the PRPs (or the so-called pro-retinal particles or PRPs)
can be used for therapeutic aspect inside the cells, enhancing their
cellular uptake efficiency should have a direct impact for their applications.
We prepared the particles as previously described26 and used step-wise centrifugation to separate them into
three different sizes (Figure 1), 1000 ± 82.5, 500 ± 22.7, and 390 ± 15.5
nm, as estimated from their SEM images. These sizes corresponded to
their hydrodynamic sizes in water of 1200 ± 51.5, 540 ±
29.0, and 430 ± 11.0 nm obtained from DLS analysis. All three-sized
PRP particles possess similar zeta potential of approximately 50 ±
0.5 mV.

PRPs. SEM images of 1000 ± 82.5 nm (A), 500 ± 22.7 nm (B),
and 390 ± 15.5 nm (C).

Penetration of PRPs into Cell-Sized Liposomes
The different
sized PRPs were tested for their ability to penetrate across the lipid
bilayer membrane using artificial cells (cell-sized liposomes, see Supporting Information Figure S3 for the lipid
structures used for the liposome construction).22 The use of the giant liposome makes it possible to focus
only on passive transport across the membrane with no involvement
from active trans-membrane mechanism. We prepared the artificial cells
with dioleoyl l-α-phosphatidylcholine using the hydration
technique as previously described.22 We
then incubated the cell-sized liposomes with PRPs and monitored fluorescence
signals of PRPs at the inside and outside of the liposomes as a function
of incubation time, using a CLFM. We observed that the 540 nm PRPs
and the 430 nm PRPs were adsorbed on the surface of the liposomes
after 30 min of incubation and the two-sized particles could penetrate
into the inside of the liposomes after 45 min incubation (Figure 2). In the case of
the 1200 nm PRPs, the fluorescence signal of the particles on the
liposomes was undetectable even after 90 min of incubation, thus implying
minimal to no interaction between the 1200 nm PRPs and the liposomes.
These results indicate that the 430–540 nm-sized PRPs penetrate
phospholipid bilayer membranes more effectively than the 1200 nm PRPs.
It should be noted here that most of the prepared liposomes are multilayered
liposomes and we observed that during the 90 min incubation time,
the penetration of the 430/540 nm PRPs took place only at the first
layer. In other words, we did not observe significant penetration
of the 430/540 nm PRPs into the interior of the smaller liposomes
inside the big liposomes.

Figure 2 Penetration of PRP micro/nano particles into
liposomes without
OCB assistance. CLFM images in phase contrast mode (on the left; gray
background) and fluorescence mode (on the right; black background;
PRP fluorescence shown in green with λex/λem of 488/510 nm) of liposomes (0.25 mM phospholipids) incubated
with the three-sized PRPs (100 μg/mL) are shown in three columns
with the sizes of PRPs indicated on top of the corresponding columns.
Images in different rows are those taken at different incubation times
as indicated on the left rim of the figure.

Using OCBs to Deliver PRPs into Cell-Sized Liposomes
Here,
we tested whether OCBs could increase the lipid bilayer membrane
penetration of the PRPs. OCBs and PRPs were mixed at the mass ratio
of OCBs/PRPs of 1:4 and then the mixture was incubated with liposomes;
the fluorescence signal of the PRPs was monitored by CLFM. The results
show that in the presence of OCBs, the fluorescence signals of the
1200 nm PRPs could be observed at the surface of the liposomes within
5 min after incubation and at the inside of the liposomes after 30
min of incubation (Figure 3). Comparing with the above experiment which was carried out
without OCB in which no PRP signal was observed at/in the liposome
after 90 min of incubation, here OCBs not only enabled the 1200 nm
PRPs to associate quickly with the surface of the liposome but also
facilitated their penetration into the liposomes’ interior.
A similar experiment on the 540 and 430 nm PRPs with OCB addition
showed fluorescence signals of the PRPs at the surface and at the
inside of the liposomes after only 5 min of incubation (Figure 3). Comparing with 45 min requirement
for the PRPs to penetrate the liposomes when there was no OCB (Figure 2), here the enhancement
in penetration rate was very obvious. Therefore, we conclude that
OCBs can enhance the association rate between the giant liposomes
and the PRPs of all sizes and can increase the degree of liposome
penetration for all three-sized PRPs.

Figure 3 Penetration of PRPs micro/nano particles
into liposomes in the
presence of OCBs. CLFM images in phase contrast mode (on the left,
gray background) and fluorescence mode (on the right, black background;
PRPs fluorescence shown in green, λex/λem of 488/510 nm) of liposomes (0.25 mM of phospholipids) incubated
with OCBs plus three-sized PRPs (100 μg/mL, mass ratio of OCBs/PRPs
of 1:4) are shown in three columns with the sizes of used PRPs indicated
on top of the corresponding columns. Images in different rows are
those taken at different incubation times as indicated on the left
rim of the figure.

As shown and discussed
above that during the 90 min incubation
time, the 430/540 nm PRPs (without OCB) could penetrate only the first
layer of the lipid bilayer membrane and therefore could not get into
the smaller liposomes located at the interior of the big liposomes.
Nevertheless, the addition of OCBs into the system could enable the
penetration of all three-sized PRPs across the second-layer liposomes
inside the first-layer liposomes. In other words, smaller liposomes
inside the big liposomes were also filled with PRPs when OCBs were
added (Figure 3, 430
and 540 nm PRPs at 45–90 min).

To investigate whether
OCBs directly interacted with PRPs, here
we incubated OCBs with the 1200 nm PRPs (at the mass ratio of OCBs/PRPs
of 1:4, similar to that used in the above experiments) and subjected
the mixture to SEM imaging. It should be mentioned here that if adhering
between the two particles was taking place, size change should be
observable. Previously, we have used this technique to compare an
ability to be adsorbed onto OCB’s surface, of different materials.23 The SEM image shows no change in size and morphology
of the 1200 nm PRPs (Supporting Information Figure S4), implying that OCBs neither directly adhere to the surface
of PRPs nor cause the deformation or size change to the PRPs. To confirm
this, we have performed the DLS analysis of PRPs, OCBs, and the mixture
of OCBs and 540 nm PRPs at 1:4 wt ratio. The results reveal the unimodule
size distribution with the average sizes of 531 ± 33.1 and 141
± 15.2 nm for PRPs and OCBs, respectively. The bimodule size
distribution with the averages of 531 ± 29.1 and 122 ± 13.3
nm was observed for the PRP + OCB mixture (Supporting Information Table S1). Interestingly, the average zeta potential
value of the mixture system (OCB to PRP at 1:4 wt ratio, zeta potential
of 48 ± 1.5 mV) resembles that of the pure PRPs (50 ± 0.3
mV). This is quite unexpected. To further investigate on this point,
we evaluated size and zeta potential of the mixture with a higher
ratio of OCBs to PRPs. The bimodule size distribution with maxima
at 122 ± 18.1 and 531 ± 24.5 nm was observed (Supporting Information Table S1). Even at a higher
ratio of OCBs to PRPs, we still observed no size change of the PRPs.
Zeta potential of PRPs was also unaffected by the increase in the
OCB concentration. These results indicate that the negative zeta potential
OCBs were not significantly adhering to the positive zeta potential
PRPs.

We speculate the hydration shell of OCB and PRP particles
act as
a barrier that inhibits the direct contact of the two particles. We
previously reported that small amphiphilic phospholipid molecules
could be adsorbed on to the surface of OCBs.23 It is due to the effective adsorption of lipid molecules, which
disrupt the local bilayer structure, so that the OCBs can directly
induce transient leak on the phospholipid bilayer membranes.23 The positively charged phospholipid molecules
are small and contain hydrophobic tails that repel water molecules.
As a result, adsorption of the lipid molecules on the OCBs can take
place in water (not so strong hydration shell around phospholipid
molecules). However, PRP particles are a result of polymer self-assembly
with entanglement, thus disruption is much harder. In other words,
to find nonparticulate PRP polymeric chain (disrupted from the particles)
with less hydration shell is very unlikely in the water.

Cellular Uptake
of PRPs
To test if OCBs could also
facilitate the penetration of particles across cell membrane, we first
tested for the cytotoxicity of OCBs in keratinocyte cells at various
OCB concentrations using the MTT assay. The result indicates no toxicity
under our experimental conditions at OCB concentrations of up to 30
μg/mL (Supporting Information, Figure
S5). Next, we investigated effects of the OCBs on an ability of PRPs
to penetrate the cell membrane. Keratinocytes were incubated with
the PRPs under two different conditions, with (Figure 4, row 1–4) and without the OCBs (Figure 4, row 5–8),
for 24 h. After incubation, the cells were washed and fixed and fluorescence
signals of the PRPs in the cells were observed using CLFM. Fluorescence
images of the cells incubated with each of the three-sized PRPs without
OCB (Figure 4 row 2–4)
barely showed fluorescence signals of PRPs in the cells. This result
indicates that without OCB, all three-sized PRPs could not significantly
penetrate into cells. Interestingly, the fluorescence signals from
PRPs inside the keratinocyte cells were very obvious when OCBs were
present (Figure 4 row
6–8). Without an addition of OCB, the numbers of keratinocyte
cells with detectable PRP fluorescence signal were ∼9.5%, for
all three-sized PRPs. In the presence of OCBs, the numbers of keratinocyte
cells with PRP fluorescence in their interior were ∼93.6% for
the 1200 nm PRPs and ∼100% for the 540 and 430 nm-sized particles.
These results clearly imply that OCBs can deliver both 1200 and 540/430
nm-sized PRPs into the cells. These results indicate that the PRPs
(at the highest tested concentration of 2 μg/mL) are nontoxic
to keratinocytes even under the condition that the OCBs help increasing
their cellular uptake. This nontoxicity of the combined materials
in the keratinocytes together with the increased cellular uptake of
the PRPs should have an impact on dermatological applications of the
pro-retinal nanoparticles. As a result, we next tested for the toxicity
of PRPs and OCBs on the three-dimensional (3D) human skin models (EpiSkin,
EpiSkin Research Institute, Lyon, France).27 The results revealed the cell viabilities of higher than 50% upon
the treatments with OCBs (at the skin coverage of 0.96 μg/cm2), PRPs (at the skin coverage of 0.064 μg/cm2), or the OCB/PRP mixture (at the skin coverage of 0.96 μg/cm2 for OCBs and 0.064 μg/cm2 for PRPs), whereas
the cell viability decreased to 8.8 ± 0.5% upon the treatment
with 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, a positive control, used at the
skin coverage of 1.6 mg/cm2). The result here indicates
possible application of the OCBs as a nontoxic cellular penetration
enhancer for micro-/nano-particulate form of therapeutic agents.

cell morphology, DAPI fluorescence, and PRP fluorescence signals are
shown in column D.

Intracellular Trafficking
We investigated an effect
of the OCBs over the intracellular trafficking of PRPs using human
liver cancer cell lines (HepG2). We used the 540 nm OCBs as representative
OCBs. The HepG2 cells were incubated with the 540 nm PRP particles
(in the presence and absence of OCBs) for 30 and 60 min, then the
PRP locations in the cells were identified through the particles’
auto fluorescence signals, whereas the locations of nucleus, endosomes,
and lysosomes compartments were determined through the fluorescence
signals of the dyes specific to these three organelles (DAPI for nuclei,
early endosome-RFP for endosome,28 and
lysotracker for lysosome29). CLFM images
of HepG2 cells incubated with PRPs (no OCB) for 30 min (Figure 5 row 2) showed no signal of
PRP fluorescence in the cells. However, after 60 min of incubation
(Figure 5 row 3), the
signals of PRP fluorescence were detected at the same locations of
fluorescence signals from endosome specific dyes, implying that the
PRPs were in the endosomes inside the cells. This indicates that some
PRPs were endocytosed into the cells.

PRPs. CLFM images of HepG2
cells after being incubated with media for 60 min (control, row 1),
with PRPs for 30 (row 2), and 60 (row 3) min, with PRPs plus OCBs
for 30 (row 4) and 60 (row 5) min: fluorescence signals from DAPI
(λex/λem of 405/450 nm, blue, column
A), PRPs (λex/λem of 488/510 nm,
red (pseudo-color), column B), early endosome tracker dyes (λex/λem of 559/584 nm, green (pseudo-color),
column C), lysosome tracker dyes (λex/λem of 650/668 nm, magenta (pseudo-color), column D), and cell
morphology from phase contrast mode (column E), and the merged images
of cell morphology, DAPI, early endosome tracker dyes and lysosome
tracker dyes (column F).

When the cells were incubated with PRPs plus OCBs for 30
min, the
fluorescence signal of PRPs were detected in cytoplasm and nucleus
of the cells (Figure 5 row 4 and Supporting Information video showing a 3D view of the cell’ interior with fluorescence
signals indicating locations of PRPs in red, nucleus from DAPI in
blue, endosomes from the tracker dyes in green and lysosomes from
the tracker dyes in magenta, and Figure S6 in Supporting Information). In addition, here PRP fluorescence
locations were related to neither the locations of endosomes nor the
locations of lysosomes. These results imply that the cellular uptake
of PRPs in the presence of OCBs is faster and more effective than
that in the absence of OCBs. More importantly, with OCBs, the cellular
uptake of PRPs does not take place via endocytic pathway.

Conclusions
Here, we show that the OCBs not only can speed up the association
between 1200, 540, and 430 nm-sized PRPs with phospholipid bilayer
membranes of giant liposomes but also can facilitate the PRP penetration
across the membrane of the liposomes. Without OCB, the submicron-sized
PRPs can slowly penetrate only the first layer of the multilayered
liposomes, whereas the micron-sized PRPs cannot penetrate the liposomes.
In contrast, in the presence of OCBs, both submicron-sized and micron-sized
PRPs can enter all layers of the multilayered liposomes. We also show
that without OCB, micron-sized PRPs could not be taken up into keratinocytes,
and submicron-sized PRPs could, in a small degree, be taken up into
keratinocytes. However, in the presence of OCBs, all of the three-sized
PRP keratinocytes could effectively get into keratinocytes. Without
OCBs, PRPs enter HepG2 cells via endocytosis; however, in the presence
of OCBs, PRPs enter cells via a nonendocytic process and can further
translocate to the cells’ nucleus. Last, OCBs and OCBs plus
PRPs are nonirritating when tested on the 3D skin model. We anticipate
that these abilities of OCBs bring micro- and nano-sized particles
into cells via a nonendocytic process, to be a starting point for
applications of OCBs as a cellular penetration enhancer for various
particulate materials.

Experimentals
Penetration of Micro/Nano
Particles into Cell-Sized Liposomes
Two conditions of PRP
penetration were observed in this experiment.
First, no OCB: the liposome suspension in water was mixed with PRPs
(1200 ± 51.5, 540 ± 29.0 or 430 ± 11.0 nm, final concentrations
of liposomes and PRPs were controlled at 0.25 mM and 100 μg/mL,
respectively). Second, with OCB: the liposome suspension in water
was incubated with the mixture of OCBs and PRPs (ratio of OCBs/PRPs
as 1:4) at final concentrations of liposomes and OCBs/PRPs mixture
of 0.25 mM and 100 μg/mL, respectively. After mixing, the suspension
was added dropwise onto the glass slide with a silicon chamber. Then,
the liposomes in the suspension were observed under a CLFM (Nikon
Digital Eclipse C1-Si, equipped with Plan Apochromat VC 100×,
BDLaser (MellesGriot, Carlsbad, CA, USA), a Nikon TE2000-U microscope,
a 32-channel PMT-spectral-detector, and Nikon-EZ-C1 Gold Version 3.80
software) with λex/λem of 488/510
nm.

Cell Culture
Preparation of Condition Medium
Mouse embryo fibroblast
cells lines (3T3, purchased from American type culture collection,
ATCC) were cultured in the mixture of Dulbecco’s modified Eagle
medium (DMEM, HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) with 10% (v/v) of fetal bovine
serum (FBS, Gibco BRL Laboratories, Grand Island, NY, USA), 1% of l-glutamine (Hyclone), and 1% of penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco). After cells were completely grown, the cells were treated
with 10 μg/mL mitomycin C (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA)
in DMEM without serum for 2 h at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The
mitomycin C-containing DMEM was removed and washed twice with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and successively added to 10 mL of DMEM/F12 (HyClone,
Logan, UT, USA) medium with 10% (v/v) of FBS, 2.5 μg/mL NaHCO3, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% of l-glutamine, and 1% of penicillin–streptomycin. The cells
were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The culture
medium was collected and centrifuged twice at 1000 rpm for 5 min.
Then growth factor [5 mg/mL human insulin, 20 ng/mL epidermal growth
factor (EGF), Gibco] was added into the supernatant for use as keratinocyte
culture medium.

without serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h. After the
cells were completely grown, the cells were treated with 10 μg/mL
mitomycin C in DMEM without serum at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h. The 3T3 cells were trypsinized using 0.25% of trypsin/ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 min. To
stop the reaction, DMEM-high glucose, 10% (v/v) of FBS, 1% of l-glutamine, and 1% of penicillin–streptomycin were added
and centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded
carefully and re-suspend in 1 mL of DMEM medium, incubated at 37 °C,
5% CO2 for 24 h to obtain feeder cells.

Preparation
of Keratinocyte Cells
Keratinocytes (American
type culture collection, ATCC) were grown in the presence of feeder
cells in the mixture of DMEM/F12 medium with 10% (v/v) of FBS, 2.5
μg/mL NaHCO3, 0.5 μg/mL hydrocortisone, 5 mg/mL
human insulin, 20 ng/mL EGF, 1% of l-glutamine, and 1% of
penicillin–streptomycin at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for
10–14 days. Then, the cells were trypsinized using 0.25% of
trypsin/EDTA solution and used afterward in the experiments.

Cytotoxicity
Test (MTT Assay)
Keratinocytes were seeded
into 96-well plates coated with 10 μg/mL collagen type I at
density of 1 × 104 cells/well in the condition medium
at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After removal of the condition
medium, cells were incubated with OCBs at concentrations of 0.1–30.0
mg/L in the condition medium, for 48 h. After incubation, 10 μL
of PBS containing 1 mg/mL MTT solution was added to each well and
the plates were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. After that, the medium
was removed from the wells and isopropanol (200 μL/well) was
added to dissolve formazan crystals. The cells were subjected to absorbance
measurement at 540 nm by a microplate reader (Varioskan LUX, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc., MA, USA). All conditions were tested in triplicate.
Cell viability was calculated using the equation below (eq 1). 1  

Cellular
Uptake and OCB Delivery of Micro/Nano Particles into
Keratinocytes
Keratinocytes were seeded into 24-well plates
on collagen type I-coated cover slips at a density of 1 × 105 cells/well in the condition medium at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. First, we investigated the cellular uptake of micro/nano
particles in the absence of OCBs. PRP particles (1200 ± 51.5,
540 ± 29.0 and 430 ± 11.0 nm) were added to cells at the
final concentration of 2.0 μg/mL. Second, the cellular uptake
in the presence of OCBs was observed by treated keratinocytes with
PRP and OCB mixtures. The final concentrations of PRPs and OCBs were
2.0 and 30.0 μg/mL, respectively. Then, all of the test plates
were left at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. The cells, that
were washed three times and replaced medium with fresh PBS, were fixed
by adding 500 μL of 4% paraformaldehyde and let stand at room
temperature for 10 min before being washed with PBS, Then, they were
incubated with 200 μL of 0.01 mg/mL DAPI solution for 3 min
(to stain nuclei of the cells) and washed with PBS before being subjected
to fluorescence microscope analysis (Zeiss Observer Z1, Carl Zeiss
Microscopy Ltd., Cambridge, UK.).

Cellular Uptake and OCB
Delivery of Micro/Nano Particles into
Human Liver Cancer Cells (HepG2)
HepG2 were maintained in
Roswell Park Memorial Institute medium 1640 (RPMI 1640 medium) with
2.05 mM of l-glutamine (Hyclone Laboratory, Inc., Logan,
UT, USA). All of the cells were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After that, HepG2 were seeded in a 8-well chamber
(Lab-Tek II Chambered Coverglass, NUNC, NY, USA) at a density of 5
× 104 cells/well, and then 50 μL of early endosome
fluorescent dye reagent (cellLight early endosome-RFP, Bacmam 2.0,
Invitrogen, USA) was added. The mixture was incubated overnight at
37 °C, 5% CO2. Then, the test samples (540 ±
29.0 nm PRPs at final concentration of 2.0 μg/mL, and 540 ±
29.0 nm PRPs plus OCBs at final concentration of PRPs and OCBs as
2.0 and 30.0 μg/mL, respectively) were added into each well.
The plates were incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 30
and 60 min. At 30 min before finishing incubation, 50 μL of
lysotracker deep red (in anhydrous dimethyl sulfoxide, Lysotracker
and Lysosensor probe, Invitrogen, USA) was added (final concentration
of lysotracker was 200 nM). Then, the cells were fixed by adding 100
μL of 4% paraformaldehyde and let to stand at room temperature
for 10 min before being washed with PBS. Then, the cells were incubated
with 100 μL of 0.01 mg/mL DAPI solution for 3 min (to stain
nuclei of cells) and washed with PBS before being monitored under
CLSM (FV3000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Excitations were carried out
at 405, 488, 559, and 650 nm, and emissions were monitored at 450,
510, 584, and 668 nm for DAPI, PRPs, early endosome specific RFP dye,
and lysosome specific deep red dye, respectively. Data were processed
with FV3000-SW software.

Irritation Test of OCBs and PRPs
EpiSkin (EpiSkin Research
Institute, Lyon, France) were transferred into 1 mL of fresh medium
and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 24 h. After that,
16 μL of the test substances (30 μg/mL OCBs, 2.0 μg/mL
540 ± 29.0 nm PRPs and the mixture of 2.0 μg/mL 540 ±
29.0 nm PRPs and 30 μg/mL OCBs) was applied on tissue and then
all tissue was covered by nylon mesh and incubated at room temperature
for 42 min. For each sample, duplicate independent experiments were
performed. Exposure to test substances were followed by rinsing with
PBS and mechanically dried. EpiSkin was transferred to the fresh medium
and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 42 h then cell
viability was measured by the MTT assay. SDS and PBS were used as
positive and negative controls, respectively. For each treated tissue,
the cell viability was expressed as percentage of the mean negative
control tissue. The mean relative tissue cell viability above 50%
predicted a nonirritancy potential of test substances.
