In the mollusk shell there exists
a framework silk fibroin–polysaccharide
hydrogel coating around nacre aragonite tablets, and this coating
facilitates the synthesis and organization of mineral nanoparticles
into mesocrystals. In this report, we identify that a protein component
of this coating, n16.3, is a hydrogelator. Due to the presence of
intrinsic disorder, aggregation-prone regions, and nearly equal balance
of anionic and cationic side chains, this protein assembles to form
porous mesoscale hydrogel particles in solution and on mica surfaces.
These hydrogel particles change their dimensionality, organization,
and internal structure in response to pH and ions, particularly Ca(II),
which indicates that these behave as ion-responsive or “smart”
hydrogels. Thus, in addition to silk fibroins, the gel phase of the
mollusk shell nacre framework layer may actually consist of several
framework hydrogelator proteins, such as n16.3, which can promote
mineral nanoparticle organization and assembly during the nacre biomineralization
process and also serve as a model system for designing ion-responsive,
composite, and smart hydrogels.

Introduction
There have been rapid advances in the
development of hydrogels
for technological purposes, spanning applications such as drug delivery,
adhesion, nanoparticle organization, cell culture, and so on.1−6 Hydrogels can be conceptualized as highly hydrated polymer networks
possessing bonding or nonbonding interchain interactions, and hydrogel
properties, such as diffusion, internal transport, and mechanical
strength, are directly linked to the degree of swelling and the chemistries
offered by the polymer network itself.1−6 Hydrogels can respond to environmental triggers, with temperature
and pH responsiveness being the two most common ones.1−6 At present, there are two areas of hydrogel research that have garnered
attention. The first is smart hydrogel technology involving the creation
of polymer networks capable of responding to multiple environmental
triggers.1,2 The second area is “composite”
hydrogels, where small inorganic particles become incorporated into
the gel network and enhance the mechanical properties of the gel phase.1,2,7 If we can gain further insights
into engineering improvements in these areas, then hydrogel technology
and the corresponding applications will advance more rapidly.

In some instances, our ability to jumpstart existing technologies
can be enhanced by the study of organisms in nature. Although synthetic
polymer networks are commonly used for hydrogel generation,1−7 there are natural polymeric systems that also lend themselves to
hydrogel formation, such as collagen, chitosan, fibrin, agarose, hyaluronic
acid, and cellulose.2 Interestingly, there
are some naturally occurring hydrogel systems in
nature that offer bioinspired insights into hydrogel technologies.
One of these is the mollusk shell, where silk fibroin proteins and
β chitin polysaccharides combine to form a framework hydrogel
environment for inorganic nanoparticle nucleation (calcium carbonates),
assembly, and the creation of a fracture-resistant composite known
as nacre.8−11 This silk–polysaccharide nacre hydrogel system may play an
important role with regard to the formation of the mollusk shell itself,
for example, creating a meshwork within the extracellular matrix that
limits ion diffusion and creates nanovolume compartmentalization that
controls the mineral nucleation process.8−11

Interestingly, there are
many nonsilk nacre proteins12−18 that coexist within the silk–polysaccharide nacre hydrogel
system as well, yet their role in the nucleation process and their
relationship to the hydrogel environment are poorly understood. Several
of these proteins are responsible for inhibiting calcite, controlling
the assembly of mineral nanoparticles into mesoscale aragonite tablets,
or controlling the nucleation process in nacre.12−18 Many of these proteins have very interesting properties, such as
the presence of intrinsic disorder or an unfolded structure and amyloid-like
cross-β strand aggregation-prone sequences, both of which promote
protein–protein aggregation and assembly.19,20 This assembly process creates supramolecular complexes or protein
phases,21−27 which have a particle and film-like character on surfaces. These
protein phases have been demonstrated to control early stages of mineralization22,24,25 and modify the surfaces and interiors
of existing crystals.21 However, the physical
nature of these nonsilk protein phases has not been fully explored:
given their association with the silk–polysaccharide gel phase,
are these nacre protein phases also hydrogels, and if so, do they
possess any interesting properties that might advance our understanding
and development of synthetic hydrogels?

In this report, we examine
an intrinsically disordered, aggregation-prone
framework oyster shell nacre protein, n16.3 (pI = 4.82; 108 AA, MW
= 12947 Da Pinctada fucata),16,18 which is one member of the framework proteome that resides within
the β chitin/silk fibroin gel coating around nacre aragonite
mesocrystal tablets.12,13 This protein possesses amyloid-like
cross-β strand aggregation sequences and a nearly equivalent
number of anionic (18) and cationic (14) side chains (Figure 1).22,23 n16.3 is known to aggregate in aqueous solutions, forming mesoscale
protein phases that modify crystal growth directions and introduce
nanotexturing to the surface of growing calcium carbonate crystals.21 Furthermore, n16.3 protein phases are also known
to capture and organize mineral nanoparticles (Figure 2) and stabilize an amorphous calcium carbonate
precursor, ACC, during the early stages of nucleation.22 Using a recombinant version of n16.3 (r-n16.3)21−23 and biophysical techniques, we confirm that these nacre protein
phases are in fact mesoscale porous hydrogel particles. These hydrogel
particles change their dimensionality, organization, and internal
structure in response to pH and ions, particularly Ca(II), which indicates
that these behave as ion-responsive or smart hydrogels. Thus, in addition
to silk fibroins, the gel phase of the mollusk shell nacre framework
layer may actually consist of several framework hydrogelator proteins,
such as n16.3. As discussed below, we believe that the nacre protein-based
hydrogels can serve as a model system for understanding the role that
disorder, aggregation propensity, and electrostatics play in hydrogel
formation, structure, and the ability to capture and organize inorganic
nanoparticles in solution.

calcium carbonate mineralization assay (see Materials
and Methods section).

Materials and Methods
Recombinant Synthesis, Purification, and
Preparation of r-n16.3
The gene synthesis, cloning, bacterial
expression, and purification
of r-n16.3 were performed by GenScript USA (Piscataway, NJ; http://www.genscript.com/)
using their proprietary OptimumGene system and recombinant expression
systems, as described elsewhere.21−23 For subsequent experimentation,
r-n16.3 samples were created by exchanging and concentrating appropriate
volumes of stock solution into unbuffered deionized distilled water
(UDDW) or other appropriate buffers using Amicon Ultra 0.5, 3 kDa
MWCO (Millipore Corporation). For the studies listed in this report,
the following buffer conditions were utilized: 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid (HEPES), pH 8.0 (denoted as low ionic strength conditions), 8.9
mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0, 10 mM HEPES/30 mM NaCl,
pH 8.0, 10 mM HEPES/1 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, and 10 mM HEPES/10
mM CaCl2, pH 8.0. All buffers were prepared in 30 nm filtered
Fisher atomic force microscopy (AFM) water (Fisher Scientific) and
filtered at 0.2 μm after pH adjustment to purge particulates.

Light Microscopy Imaging of r-n16.3 Protein Hydrogel Particles
For detection of mesoscale protein hydrogel particles, 5 μL
of 30 μM r-n16.3 solution in the appropriate buffer (see above)
was placed on a clean glass slide with a glass coverslip and imaged
using bright field microscopy (100× objective, Nikon DS-U3 Light
Microscope). Note that higher protein concentrations were required
to generate sufficiently large hydrogels for visualization purposes.

AFM Imaging of r-n16.3 Assemblies
We investigated the
dimensional and morphological characteristics of r-n16.3 assemblies
(1.3 μM and 380 nM final protein concentrations) deposited onto
mica substrates under different buffer conditions (see above and the
Figure legends). AFM experiments22 were
executed at 25 °C using an Asylum MFP-3D standalone AFM operating
in tapping mode in buffer solution. V-shaped Si3N4 cantilevers (reported spring constant 0.09 N/m) were used for imaging.
A precise drive frequency in fluid (∼9 kHz) was calculated
for each cantilever before imaging by overlaying the thermal spectrum
over the frequency sweep. All samples (100 μL) were aliquoted
onto a freshly stripped surface of mica (Ted Pella, Inc., 0.9 mm thick)
and incubated for a period of 15 min at ambient temperature before
measurement. Igor Pro 6.01 software (http://www.wavemetrics.com) was used for image acquisition at a scan rate of 2 Hz. The Gwyddion
Software package (www.gwyddion.net) was implemented for image processing, noise filtering, and analysis
of surface parameters, such as Rq.

Flow Cytometry
Experiments of r-n16.3 Protein Aggregates
The aggregation
of r-n16.3 (30 μM final concentration) was
studied in the above-mentioned buffers. The samples were prepared
and allowed to sit for 5 min before analysis. Aggregation measurements
were performed using a multi-parameter cell analyzer CytoFLEX (Beckman
Coulter, CA). Each sample solution (100 μL) was analyzed at
a continuous flow rate of 10 μL/min using four laser excitation
lines of 405, 488, 561, and 640 nm to register two light-scattering
parameters (forward-scattered light (FSC)-A and side-scattered light
(SSC)-A)28−30 and the number of events for each sample. Data were
collected using the CytExpert 1.2.11.0 software designed for the instrument
and processed using the FlowJo software (TreeStar, OR).

Mineralization
Assays
Stock concentrations of r-n16.3
were prepared using 0.2 μM filtered UDDW. Mineralization assays
were adapted from published protocols22 and were conducted by mixing equal volumes of 20 mM CaCl2·2H2O (pH 5.5) and 20 mM NaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.75) to a final volume of 500 μL
in sealed polypropylene tubes and incubating at room temperature for
5 min. Aliquots of r-n16.3 stock solution were added to the calcium
solution before the beginning of the reaction, with final protein
assay concentration of 30 μM. The final pH of the reaction mixture
was measured and found to be approximately 8.0–8.2. For TEM
studies, a 10 μL aliquot of the mineralization assay supernatant
was withdrawn at the completion of the assay period, spotted onto
Formvar-coated Au TEM grids (200 square mesh; Ted Pella, Inc.), and
washed with 0.2 μm filtered calcium carbonate saturated methanol.
TEM and electron diffraction were performed using a Philips CM12 transmission
electron microscope equipped with a tungsten filament electron beam
source. All imaging and diffraction analyses were performed at 120
keV. A diffraction pattern of a polycrystalline gold standard was
used as a calibration scale for all subsequently recorded diffraction
patterns. The selected-area diffraction patterns were analyzed and
indexed using the CrysTBox software package (www.fzu.cz/crystbox).

Bioinformatics
To determine the location of disordered
sequence regions within the n16.3 sequence, we employed the DISOPRED331 and IUP_PRED32 prediction
algorithms using default parameters. Subsequently, we used TANGO,33 AGGRESCAN,34 and
ZIPPER DB35 with default parameters to
globally identify putative cross-β strand sequence regions that
exhibit association propensities (Figure 1).

Results and Discussion
r-n16.3
Forms Hydrogel-Like Particles That Respond to pH and
Ionic Strength Conditions
As shown in Figure 3, top panel, light microscopy studies reveal
that r-n16.3 at pH 8.0 (similar to the pH of nucleation studies)22 forms translucent particles that appear gel-like.
These particles have irregular morphologies and appear to be porous
as evidenced by the presence of void-like regions within the particles.
On freshly cleaved mica surfaces, tapping-mode AFM imaging (middle
and bottom panels) shows that these particles have an elongated morphology
not unlike that seen in the light microscope under identical conditions
(Figure 3). Note that
relative to plain mica surfaces, mica surfaces that contain the r-n16.3
protein have a higher surface roughness value, Rq, indicating the presence of a protein coating or film on
the mica surface (Figure 3, histogram plot).

Figure 3 Imaging of 1.3 μM r-n16.3 protein phases

8.0), and 30 mM NaCl/10
mM HEPES (pH 8/NaCl). Light microscope images taken at 100× magnification
of 30 μM r-n16.3 samples. AFM tapping-mode amplitude images
are plotted at 1 μm × 1 μm. “AFM data set”
refers to statistical measurements of mean particle heights, diameters,
and surface roughness or Rq factor, ±S.D.,
taken for 30 particles under each buffer condition. The Rq values for plain mica under each buffer condition were
subtracted from protein values. Scale bars in light microscope images
= 10 μm and in AFM = 200 nm.

We next studied these protein particles under two different
conditions:
8.9 mM NaH2PO4, pH 4.0, and 10 mm HEPES, 30
mM NaCl, pH 8.0, with both buffer conditions possessing the same ionic
strength value as 10 mM HEPES/10 mM CaCl2. As we shall
see, similarities in ionic strength values allow cross-comparisons
between these conditions and later Ca(II) studies. We will first consider
low pH conditions (pH 4.0), which are below the pI (4.85) of this
protein. Note in Figure 3 that there are dimensional changes in mesoscale hydrogel particles
in response to protein side chain protonation. At pH 4.0, the particles
become smaller in diameter but retain the same particle heights relative
to pH 8.0, as confirmed by both light microscopy (top panel) and tapping-mode
AFM (middle, bottom panels), respectively. However, at pH 4.0, the Rq value is ∼3× that measured at
pH 8.0, indicating that the protein film thickness has increased at
pH 4.0 (histogram plot). Since r-n16.3 has 18 carboxylate residues
(Asp, Glu) (Figure 1), it is clear that carboxylate protonation at low pH values induces
charge shielding and alters the electrostatics of the protein molecules.22,23 Furthermore, mica surfaces are anionic, and thus, protonation will
change the electrostatics of protein–mica interactions.22 In both cases, protonation affects the assembly
of r-n16.3 and triggers a decrease in particle diameters and an increase
in protein film formation on the mica surface.

When we examine
the 30 mM NaCl/pH 8.0 scenario, we expect that
Na+ and Cl– ions will induce some degree
of charge shielding on the anionic and cationic residues,23 respectively, on protein molecules and induce
morphological, interfacial, and dimensional changes to the protein
hydrogel particles. Moreover, we would also expect charge shielding
to induce particle rearrangements on anionic mica surfaces.22 In the presence of NaCl this is exactly what
we observe: Light microscopy reveals large hydrogel particles that
appear to have smaller particles clustered or associated at the particle
interfaces (Figure 3, top panel). Similar clustering phenomena were also observed in
AFM imaging on mica surfaces, where rounded morphologies and the presence
of large and small particle diameters were noted along with evidence
of particle chain formation (Figure 3, middle and bottom panels). Furthermore, although
the protein particle diameters are similar to those observed at low
ionic strength, the Rq value increases
by a factor ∼6× relative to low ionic strength conditions,
which indicates that protein film formation on mica has significantly
increased in the presence of NaCl (Figure 3, histogram plot). From these results, we
conclude that r-n16.3 protein molecules assemble to form mesoscale
hydrogel particles both on surfaces and in solution that are dimensionally
and interactively responsive to pH and salt conditions.

Introduction
of Ca(II) Ions Leads to r-n16.3 Hydrogel Particle
Organization
We now consider what happens to r-n16.3 hydrogel
particles when they are exposed to Ca(II) ions relative to low ionic
strength conditions at pH 8.0. Here, the most relevant scenario is
10 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0, which mimics the conditions found
within in vitro mineralization assays (Figure 2)22 minus the
carbonate species. For AFM studies in the presence of Ca(II), we used
protein concentrations of 380 nM, which minimize the degree of aggregation
buildup that interferes with AFM tip movement and placement,22 thereby allowing greater imaging detail to be
observed rather than obscured by the Ca(II)-induced aggregation process.
We also examined a lower Ca(II) ion concentration, 1 mM, at pH 8.0,
to determine any trends that Ca(II) ions introduce into r-n16.3 aggregation
and hydrogel formation.

As noted in previous AFM studies of
r-n16.3 at lower concentrations (i.e., 77 nM or 1/5 of 380 nM), the
introduction of 10 mM Ca(II) leads to an increase in protein particle
diameters, heights, and film thicknesses on mica surfaces, in response
to Ca(II) interactions with Asp, Glu residues, and the anionic mica
surface.22 As shown in Figure 4, we note these same effects
at 380 nM r-n16.3 and discover new Ca(II)-induced effects at this
higher protein concentration. Relative to the pH 8.0 low ionic strength
scenario, the introduction of 1 mM Ca(II) leads to a clustering effect
that can be visualized both at the light microscope and AFM tapping-mode
levels. In the light microscope (top panel), we observe mesoscale
protein hydrogel particles that consist of clusters of smaller particles
that are less translucent and create a coarsening effect to the overall
hydrogel appearance. On mica surfaces (middle and bottom panels),
we also observe a similar clustering effect, and in some cases, we
can actually observe the formation of linear chains. This clustering
effect intensifies at 10 mM Ca(II) concentrations, where in the light
microscope, we observe further loss in particle translucency, increased
coarsening, and the appearance of hydrogel particle chains forming
and organizing in solution. Similarly, on mica surfaces, 10 mM Ca(II)
solutions induce protein particle organization into fibers with irregular
morphologies. At this time, we do not fully understand why Ca(II)
ions induce a more linear or fibrous configuration to r-n16.3 hydrogels
in solution and on surfaces. We speculate that side chain–Ca(II)
affinities or Ca(II)-mediated side chain–side chain salt bridging
interactions between protein molecules may be responsible for the
induction of linear or fiber-like clusters. Obviously, other conditions
that induce simple charge shielding (i.e., pH 4.0, NaCl) are incapable
of producing this effect (Figure 3). In conclusion, our data demonstrates that, in comparison
to protonation and monovalent cation shielding (Figure 3), the introduction of Ca(II) triggers changes
in r-n16.3 hydrogel structure, dimension, and organization (cluster-to-fibrous
transition) in solution and on surfaces (Figure 4).

r-n16.3 Hydrogel Particles
in Flow Exhibit Particle Size and
Internal Granularity Changes in Response to Ionic Solutions
One of the more intriguing aspects of our data set is that light
microscope images of r-n16.3 reveal changes not only in particle morphology
but also in the internal porosities as a function of pH and ionic
species (Figures 3 and 4). To confirm the external and internal changes
that occur with mesoscale r-n16.3 hydrogel particles as a function
of buffer conditions, we applied a technique typically used for analyzing
transparent micron-sized cell populations, flow cytometry (Figure 5),28−30 to map physical
changes in translucent mesoscale protein particles under buffer conditions
that parallel our light microscopy and AFM imaging studies (Figures 3 and 4). There are two light-scattering parameters that one can
monitor for particles under constant flow: (1) FSC (x-axis) to determine the particle size distribution and (2) SSC (y-axis) to measure refracted and reflected light that occurs
at any interface within the particles where there is a change in refractive
index (RI) that results from variations in particle granularity or
internal structure.28−30 Note that our flow cytometry experiments do not provide
exact particle size data, only distributions of particle sizes. In
addition, one can also monitor the particle number count in the flow
as a function of time, typically as a one-dimensional (1-D) histogram
plot, as shown in Figure 5, bottom panel.28−30

Figure 5 Flow cytometry experiments conducted with
30 μM r-n16.3.
(Top panel) Two-dimensional density plots of FSC as a function of
SSC. Here, FSC (x-axis) determines particle size
distributions and SSC (y-axis) measures refracted
and reflected light that occurs at any interface within the particles
where there is a change in RI that results from variations in particle
granularity or internal structure.28−30 (Bottom panel) 1-D particle
number as a function of flow time under different ionic conditions.
In the 1-D particle number plots, the number in the upper left corner
of each plot denotes the particle count number obtained for that plot.
Note that the pH 4.0, pH 8.0/NaCl, and pH 8.0/10 mM Ca(II) scenarios
are equivalent in ionic strength.

As we observe in Figure 5, top panel, low ionic strength conditions at pH 8.0
generate
a very limited distribution of particle sizes and internal structure
or granularity. When we transition to pH 4.0, the particle number
count more than doubles (bottom panel), and we note that particle
size distributions and internal structure increase proportionally
(top panel), indicating that Asp and Glu protonation induces changes
not only in the hydrogel protein molecules22,23 but within the hydrogels themselves. In the presence of 30 mM NaCl
at pH 8.0, the particle number counts (bottom panel), particle size
distributions, and internal structure (top panel) are found to be
very similar to low ionic strength conditions, i.e., there are limited
distributions. Although this would appear to contradict the data obtained
from AFM imaging studies (Figure 3, top panel), one must remember that the electrostatics
of the anionic mica surface play an important role in particle behavior
and physical state,22 and this factor is
absent from the flow cytometry experiments.

The most dramatic
results are observed when Ca(II) is introduced
(Figure 5). Here, we
again observe proportional increases in particle size distributions
and internal granularities (top panel), as we go from 1 to 10 mM CaCl2 concentrations. These phenomena correlate with the imaging
coarseness and loss of translucency observed in our light microscope
studies of these hydrogel particles under identical conditions (Figure 4). Furthermore, the
particle number counts increase by a factor of ∼2× at
1 mM Ca(II) and ∼5× at 10 mM Ca(II) relative to low ionic
strength conditions at the same pH value. We note that at 10 mM CaCl2 the proportionality in particle size distributions and internal
granularities mirror those seen at pH 4, and this may reflect the
similarities in the charge shielding effects that protons and Ca(II)
ions exert on r-n16.3 hydrogels. However, the range of FSC and SSC
parameters is not identical [i.e., Ca(II) conditions feature a larger
range of values], and we note that the particle numbers obtained for
Ca(II) are higher than those obtained for pH 4 (Figure 5, lower panel). Thus, we believe that the
effect of pH 4.0 and 10 mM CaCl2 conditions on protein
hydrogel particles is not truly identical. In summary, low pH and
Ca(II) ions introduce the most significant changes in r-n16.3 hydrogel
particle number, size distributions, and internal structure (Figure 5). Overall (Figures 3–5), we conclude that the framework r-n16.3 protein
is a hydrogelator that forms ion-responsive mesoscale gels both on
surfaces and in solution.

In conclusion, in addition to the
silk fibroin−β chitin
polysaccharide gel layer, which coats mesoscale nacre aragonite tablets
in the mollusk shell,8−11 we have now identified another framework aragonitic protein of the
mollusk shell, n16.3, as a hydrogelator. The fact that this hydrogel
can capture and organize mineral nanoparticles (Figure 2)21,22 makes this a composite
hydrogel system.1,2,7 Interestingly,
this protein is associated with the silk fibroin−β chitin
polysaccharide gel layer, and thus, it is plausible that n16.3 and
perhaps other framework protein hydrogelators may be subcomponents
of this silk–polysaccharide gel nacre layer phase. We note
that other invertebrate skeletal systems, specifically the sea urchin
calcitic spicule36 and the nacre layer
of the red abalone,37 also possess nonsilk
fibroin proteins that are hydrogelators, and this suggests that protein
hydrogels play an important role in the biomineralization process
within a wide variety of calcium carbonate-based organisms.

The intriguing response of the r-n16.3 hydrogel particles to different
ionic conditions (Figures 3 and 4) indicates that the protein
molecules (Figure 1) and the hydrogel particles that they form are ion-responsive or
smart, with the most dramatic results obtained with Ca(II) ions. At
this time, there are several unanswered questions regarding why Ca(II)
induces such dramatic changes in hydrogel organization (i.e., particulate
to fibrous, Figure 4) and hopefully these will be addressed by future studies. In general,
the discovery of porous nacre protein hydrogels represents a tremendous
step forward in our understanding of the biomineralization process
in mollusk shell nacre. Potentially, hydrogel porosities provide several
important features for the nucleation process and crystal building:
volume confinement, compartmentalization, assembly, and organization.38,39 As shown in Figure 2, first, r-n16.3 hydrogels are capable of hosting and organizing
calcium carbonate mineral nanoparticles within their porous matrices,
and we believe that the size of these mineral nanoparticles is most
likely limited by the pore sizes that exist within the hydrogel particles.
Second, the porous matrices introduce a diffusion or kinetic barrier
to nucleating ion complexes, as witnessed by r-n16.3 increasing the
time interval for prenucleation cluster (PNC) formation40−43 compared to protein-deficient controls.22 Third, the ion responsiveness may act as a trigger for hydrogel
participation in CaCO3 nucleation events, that is, hydrogels
change size, morphology, association, and organization (Figure 4) and internal structure in
response to Ca(II) ions (Figure 5), which in turn can affect the assembly and organization
of mineral nanoparticles (Figure 2),21,22 which has been proposed as an
important event in the crystallization by the particle attachment38 mechanism that leads to aragonite tablet formation.

Finally, what insights do nacre protein hydrogels offer material
science and nanotechnology? We believe that there are several important
lessons that one can glean from this study. The first is that disordered,
aggregation-prone polymers containing a nearly equivalent number of
anionic and cationic side chains, such as r-n16.3 (Figure 1),22,23 can form smart hydrogels in solution under a wide variety of conditions
(Figures 2–5). The presence of both anionic and cationic charged
groups allows for molecular electrostatic responsiveness in different
ionic media and, as discussed earlier, may play a role in the formation
of the hydrogels themselves via complementary ion pairing. Furthermore,
charged side chains may participate in the attraction of nascent PNCs
that form during the early phases of the nucleation process38−43 and may explain why r-n16.3 hydrogel particles nucleate intragel
mineral nanoparticle deposits over time, forming a composite hydrogel
(Figure 2).22 The second important feature is the change in
exterior dimensionality and interior granularities or structure in
response to environmental conditions (Figure 5). On the basis of our light microscope imaging
(Figures 3 and 4), we speculate that the changes in granularities
reflect changes in hydrogel porosities, either in terms of the number
of porosities, their size, and/or their location within the protein
hydrogel particles. In turn, these adjustments to ionic media may
eventually influence the formation, size, and distribution of mineral
nanoparticles38,39 within the hydrogels (Figure 2). Collectively,
these nacre protein hydrogel features are worthy of further exploration
in future studies, such that we can apply these concepts to new and
useful composite, responsive smart hydrogels for materials and nanotechnology
applications.
