Density
functional theory calculations were carried out to study
the electrochemical properties including reduction potentials, pKa values, and thermodynamic hydricities of three
prototypical cobaloxime complexes, Co(dmgBF2)2 (dmgBF2 = difluoroboryl-dimethylglyoxime), Co(dmgH)2 (dmgH = dimethylglyoxime), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl)
(py = pyridine) in the acetonitrile (AN)–water solvent mixture.
The electrochemical properties of Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure AN and pure water were also considered for comparison to
reveal the key roles of the solvent on the catalytic reaction. In
agreement with previous studies, hydrogen production pathways starting
from reduction of the resting state of CoII and involving
formation of the CoIIIH and CoIIH intermediates
are the favorable ones for both bimetallic and monometallic pathways.
However, we found that in pure AN, both the CoIIIH and
CoIIH intermediates can react with a proton to produce
H2. In the presence of water in the solvent, the reduction
of CoIIIH to CoIIH is necessary for the reaction
with a proton to occur to form H2. This suggests that it
is possible to design catalytic systems by suitably tuning the composition
of the AN–water mixture. We also identified the key role of
axial coordination of the solvent molecules in affecting the catalytic
reaction, which allows further catalyst design strategy. The highest
hydride donor ability of Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl) indicates that
this complex displays the best catalytic hydrogen-producing performance
among the three cobaloximes studied in this work.

1 Introduction
Extensive
experimental and theoretical efforts1−22 have been devoted to understand the H2-generation properties
of cobaloximes and other cobalt-based molecular complexes, providing
important information on the reaction mechanism and for the development
of efficient hydrogen-producing catalysts. The possible H2-production pathways by cobaloxime complexes are summarized in Scheme 1.1,23 All
reaction pathways are associated with electron and proton transfers
to the Co center, starting with the reduction of states of CoIII or CoII to CoI. The CoI can then be protonated to form CoIIIH or be reduced to
form Co0. H2 production can occur via protonation
of CoIIIH (monometallic pathway) or through a bimolecular
reaction between two CoIIIH (bimetallic pathway). Alternatively,
CoIIIH can be reduced and Co0 can be protonated
to form CoIIH, which can then react via either the monometallic
or bimetallic pathway to generate H2. Here the Roman numerals
are the oxidation states of the Co ions during the reactions, and
H is the proton bonded to it.

Scheme 1 H2-Generation Pathways
at the Cobalt Center of Cobaloximes
An important step toward understanding the mechanism and
thus the
design of efficient transition metal-based catalyst lies in the characterization,
through experimental and theoretical investigations, of the electrochemical
properties (e.g., redox potentials, pKa values, and thermodynamic hydricities) of the catalysts and their
roles in affecting the catalytic efficiency.19,24−29 To the best of our knowledge, most existing calculations of the
reduction potentials and pKa values of
cobaloximes were performed with pure acetonitrile (AN) as the solvent.20,23,30,31 Few theoretical studies have reported on the thermodynamic hydricity
of cobaloxime-based hydrides. However, many catalytic hydrogen production
systems have been found to function in the AN–water mixtures.12,32−38 Moreover, one of the goals of the water-splitting catalysis study
is to develop catalysts that work efficiently in the pure aqueous
environment.39 To better interpret the
experimental results and thus design more robust and efficient cobaloxime
catalysts that function in pure water, it is necessary to carry out
studies on the reduction potential, pKa, and thermodynamic hydricities of cobaloximes with the solvation
effects of the AN–water solvent included.

This paper
examines the thermodynamic properties of the three cobaloximes,
Co(dmgBF2)2, Co(dmgH)2, and Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl), using the density functional theory (DFT) methods.
In particular, the reduction potentials, pKa values, and thermodynamic hydricities of these complexes along the
catalytic hydrogen-production cycle in the solvation media of pure
AN, pure water, and 1-to-1 mole ratio of AN–water mixture were
calculated. The DFT calculations provide key information on the catalytic
hydrogen production reactions. By comparing the results of different
cobaloximes and solvation environments, the effects of ligands and
the solvation environment on the hydrogen production properties of
the complexes can be revealed. This paper is organized as follows:
in Section 2, the simulation
details utilized in this work are introduced. The results and the
thermodynamic analysis are presented and discussed in Section 3. In particular, we first
report the results of the reduction potentials and pKa values of the cobaloximes in the AN–water mixture
in Section 3.1. Then
in Section 3.2, with
the results of reduction potentials and pKa values, we analyze the free-energy diagrams of the hydrogen production
pathways according to the reactions presented in Scheme 1 to identify the favorable
hydrogen production pathways for the cobaloximes in the AN–water
mixture. The effects of the ligands on the redox properties of the
complexes are also discussed. In Section 3.3, using Co(dmgBF2)2 as the example, we illustrate the effects of the solvation environment,
which is pure AN, AN–water mixture, and pure water, on the
redox properties of the cobaloxime complex and on the hydrogen production
pathways. In Section 3.4, we compare the catalytic properties of different cobaloxime
complexes by analyzing the calculated thermodynamic hydricities. Based
on the calculations in this paper and existing experimental results,
we also analyze and compare the catalytic performance of the three
cobaloxime complexes in the AN–water mixture, which is displayed
in Section 3.5. The
last section is the summary and conclusions.

2 DFT Approaches
for the Calculation of Reduction
Potentials, pKa Values, and Thermodynamic
Hydricities
The calculations in this paper were carried out
using the localized
basis set DFT approach in the NWChem package.40 The Hirshfeld charge41 analysis was also
carried out using the Multiwfn package.42 The structures were first optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of
theory in vacuum without the implicit solvent model. We then performed
the energetic studies with larger basis sets to obtain the DFT total
energies (ε0(DFT)). The Def2-TZVPD basis sets, which
have been extensively tested and used in previous theoretical calculations
for cobalt-based molecular complexes, were chosen for cobalt.43,44 For other elements, the 6-311++G** basis sets were used. The basis
set superposition error for the calculation of pKa values, hydride donor abilities, and solvent molecule
binding energies to the cobaloxime complexes is corrected by the counter-poise
method.45 The thermal corrections to the
Gibbs free energy (ΔGcorr = ΔH – TΔS)
at room temperature (298.15 K) were obtained using the B3LYP/6-31G**
method via harmonic frequency calculations on the optimized geometries.
ΔH is the thermal correction to the enthalpy,
and ΔS is the entropy contribution. The solvation
correction to the Gibbs free energy (ΔGs) was calculated by including the dielectric screening effects
of the solvent at the B3LYP/6-31G** level. The dielectric screening
was treated with the conductor-like screening model solvation model46 implemented in the NWChem package.40 The dielectric constants of AN and water used
here are the experimental values of 35.9 and 78.4, respectively.47 The dielectric constant of the mixed solvents
of AN and water with the mole fraction of AN as xAN = 0.5 was chosen as the experimental value of 46.8.47 The Gibbs free energy (Go) of each reaction species in the solution is then obtained
as 1  ΔGo,redox, the Gibbs free-energy change of the
reduction reaction in solution,
was calculated through the Born–Haber cycle.20,48,49 The reduction potential (Eo) was then calculated according to the relation50 2  where F is the Faraday constant
and n is the number of transferring electrons (in
this study, n = 1 for the single-electron reduction
reaction). The pKa was calculated from
an analogous Born–Haber cycle and obtained as follows50 3  

The standard state
correction from 1 atm pressure in the gas phase
to one molar in the solution was not included in the calculation because
this is cancelled out as the same correction is added to the species
in the reactants and the products.20 In
here, we considered the reaction condition under strong acidic condition
with pH = 0. All calculated reduction potentials are referenced to
the normal hydrogen electrode (NHE), which was calculated from the
reaction H+(s) + e–(g) → 1/2H2(g). The proton solvation free energy, G*(H(s)+), is −260.2 kcal/mol in AN and −265.9
kcal/mol in water.51 Moreover, the free
energy of a gas-phase electron is G*(e(g)–) = −0.868 kcal/mol.52 To the best of our knowledge, the value of G*(H(s)+) in the AN–water with mole fraction
of AN as xAN = 0.5 has not been reported.
Here, we estimate this value to be −263.0 kcal/mol by taking
the mean of the values in pure water and in pure AN. The reason for
the use of the average value is that the solvation energies of the
proton in different solvents are very close. In fact, the overall
change of the proton solvation energy from pure water to pure AN is
only 5.7 kcal/mol. As will be seen later, this is not the determining
factor on the possible pathways. The NHE in the pure AN, pure water,
and the AN–water mixture were calculated to be 4.75, 4.50,
and 4.62 V, respectively. To test the calculation method for the reduction
potentials and pKa values, we carried
out a benchmarking study to compare the results for the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex solvated in pure AN with existing works
(Section S2 in the Supporting Information). The results show that our calculations agree reasonably well with
previous DFT calculations on the reduction potentials and the pKa values.20,23

To better describe
the effects of the solvent, two AN molecules
were included in the gas phase calculation as the axial ligands when
considering the complexes solvated in pure AN. Similarly, two water
molecules were included when studying the solvation in pure water.
The solvent effect in the AN–water mixture (the mole fraction
of AN is 0.5) was considered by ligating one AN molecule and one water
molecule to the cobalt complex from each side of the planar structure.
These coordination configurations were previously found to be favorable
in each case.18 For Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl), the Cl– was found to readily dissociate
from the complex and be replaced by a H2O molecule in the
aqueous environment after being reduced.53 Therefore, Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl) was replaced by Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) when solvated in the AN–water
mixture. In this work, we used Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) to denote the cobaloxime complexes solvated
in the AN–water mixture. Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(AN)
and Co(dmgBF2)2(H2O)(H2O) were used to symbolize the Co(dmgBF2)2 solvated
in pure AN and pure water, respectively.

Thermodynamic hydricity
(ΔGH–) (or hydride
donor ability) is the free energy required to
cleave an M–H bond to generate a hydride ion (H–)27 4  where the free
energies of the species were
calculated using procedures similar to those used to calculate the
reduction potentials and pKa values, as
described above. In this work, the thermodynamic hydricities of the
reaction intermediates of [CoIIIH]0 and [CoIIH]− were calculated. The superscripts next
to the brackets are the total charges of the species.

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 Reduction Potentials and
pKa Values of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in the AN–Water
Mixture
We first studied the reaction pathways and intermediates
for the
three cobaloxime complexes at the B3LYP/6-31G** level of theory. The
structures of the reaction intermediates of the cobaloxime complexes
in AN–water mixture are shown in Figures S1 to S3 in the Supporting Information. The hydrogen production
reaction pathways found in the localized basis set DFT calculations
in this work are in agreement with those found in the plane-wave DFT
calculations.18

Table 1 lists the reduction potentials
and pKa values for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in the 1-to-1
mixing AN–water solvent. pKa1 corresponds
to the acidic proton dissociation reaction of [CoIIIH]0 for these complexes  The pKa2 corresponds
to the acid dissociation reaction of [CoIIH]−

E vs NHE (V)	CoIII/CoII	CoII/CoI	CoI/Co0	CoIIIH/CoIIH	pKa1	pKa2

Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O)	0.06	–1.65	–1.93	–1.38	18.72	28.37	
Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)	0.10	–1.61	–2.29	–1.58	17.34	29.07	
As shown
in Table 1, the reduction
potentials (Eo) of redox
couples of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) are
higher than those of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and
Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) for all steps. This indicates
that the Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) complex
can accept electrons more easily than the other two complexes. The
pKa for the acid dissociation reaction
of [CoIIIH]0 (pKa1) and [CoIIH]− (pKa2) for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) were calculated to be 6.03 and 12.79, respectively, both of which
are smaller than those of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O)
and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). Thus, the metal hydrides
[CoIIIH]0 and [CoIIH]− of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)H2O dissociate
more easily to form H+ and the base in the AN–water
mixture. This finding is consistent with the results in our ab initio
molecular dynamics simulation in the liquid solvent,18 which showed that the protonation processes for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) are less favorable compared
to those for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O). The reduction
potentials of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) are generally closer in value compared
to those of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O).
The reduction potentials of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) are slightly higher than those of Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) for the CoI/Co0 and CoIIIH/CoIIH couples. The pKa1 of
Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) (18.72) is slightly larger
than that of Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) (17.34), whereas
the pKa2 of the former (28.37) is slightly
smaller than the latter (29.07).

The more positive or less negative
charge of the active site may
result in a higher reduction potential and smaller pKa values, and vice versa. The active site of the cobaloxime
complexes for hydrogen production is normally considered to be only
the Co center.1,23 However, our calculations show
that the atomic charge of N atoms around the Co ion changes significantly
during the redox process of the cobaloxime complexes (Table 2), indicating the redox noninnocent
role54 of the N atoms in the hydrogen production
reaction. Such redox noninnocent properties of the N atoms can significantly
affect the redox properties of the Co center. From the CoIIIH to the CoIIH species, the atomic charge of the H bonded
to the Co can also change significantly on the reduction reaction
(Table 2). To better
account for the role of the atomic charge in the redox properties
of the cobaloxime complexes, we treated in this work the Co ion and
the 4 N atoms around it as the active sites. For the CoIIIH and CoIIH species, the H bonded to the Co ion is also
included as the active site. When considering the total Hirshfeld
charge of the Co ion and the atoms that coordinate with it (i.e.,
N atoms in the glyoxime ligands and the H that is bonded to the Co
ion), we found that the more positive or less negative total charge
for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) leads to
higher reduction potentials and smaller pKa values of the intermediates, compared to that of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)
(Table 2). This is
in agreement with the previous DFT study31 on cobaloximes, which shows that the reduction potentials of the
complex increase when the electrostatic potential of the Co center
become less negative. The total charge of the active sites can also
explain the differences between the thermodynamic hydricities of the
hydrides, which will be discussed in Section 3.4.

For Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O), the difference in the reduction potentials
and pKa values are relatively small. The
reduction potentials of CoI/Co0 and CoIIIH/CoIIH support the relationship between the charge of
the active sites and the reduction potentials, as described above.
For the cases of CoIII/CoII and CoII/CoI, the difference between Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) is less than
0.05 V, which is too small to justify the charge-reduction potential
relationship, especially considering the systematic errors in the
DFT calculations. The small difference between Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)
may be due to the same planar structure and similar coordination of
the N atom in AN or py to the Co center during the early stage of
the reaction. Moreover, the easy dissociation of the axial ligand
from the complexes makes these two complexes the same at the end of
the reaction.18,53

3.2 Free-Energy
Diagrams of Hydrogen Production
Reaction Pathways of Cobaloximes in the AN–Water Mixture
To analyze the hydrogen production pathways of the cobaloximes,
we calculated the reaction free-energy diagrams that correspond to
the various sequences of electron and proton addition, as illustrated
in Scheme 1. First,
we compare the free-energy diagrams of the monometallic hydrogen production
pathways in the AN–water mixture. The diagrams of the monometallic
pathways with the potential of NHE (Eo(H+/H2)) as the reference are displayed in Figure 1a for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Figure 2a for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Figure 3a
for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). We also show the free-energy
diagrams with the bias potential that equals the reduction potential
of the CoII/CoI couple (i.e., Eo(CoII/CoI)) in Figure 1c for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Figure 2c for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Figure 3c for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). In other words, they are the free-energy
diagrams referenced to Eo(CoII/CoI). These better illustrate the reaction process because
the catalytic reaction only proceeds under an applied potential that
is more negative than Eo(CoII/CoI).

Figure 1 Free-energy diagrams of hydrogen production pathways:
(a,c) monometallic
and (b,d) bimetallic of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) in the 1-to-1 mixing AN–water mixture. Relative
free-energy between the electron-transfer steps was calculated with
respect to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias potential (a,b) and with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (c,d) for
Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) in the AN–water
mixture.

pathways: (a,c) monometallic
and (b,d) bimetallic of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) in
the 1-to-1 mixing AN–water mixture. Relative free-energy between
the electron-transfer steps was calculated with respect to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias
potential (a,b) and with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (c,d) for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) in the AN–water mixture.

Figure 3 Free-energy diagrams of hydrogen production pathways:
(a,c) monometallic
and (b,d) bimetallic of Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in
the 1-to-1 mixing AN–water mixture. Relative free-energy between
the electron-transfer steps was calculated with respect to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias
potential (a,b) and with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (c,d) for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in the AN–water mixture.

By looking at the free-energy diagrams with bias
potential equal
to Eo(CoII/CoI),
we can find that hydrogen production by the Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) complex in pathway 1 via the protonation
of CoIIH is exothermic along all steps (Figure 1c). For pathway 2, the step
involving the reaction between CoIIIH and a proton to produce
H2 needs to overcome an energy barrier. This indicates
that Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) prefers
to produce H2 in pathway 1, whereas pathway 2 is unfavorable.
The results of the hydrogen production pathways for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) here were also observed in the
DFT studies of Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure AN.20,23 Our previous simulations conducted in the gas phase and in liquid
solvent also support the finding that the second proton transfer from
the H2O molecule to the Co center only occurs when the
CoIIIH is reduced to CoIIH.18

For Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and
Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O), both the monometallic pathways,
pathway 1 and
pathway 2, are exothermic with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (Figure 2c for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Figure 3c for
Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)). This suggests that both
CoIIIH and CoIIH species for these two complexes
are thermodynamically active to react with a proton to produce H2. The favorable H2 generation pathway via the protonation
of CoIIIH for the Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl) complex
has also been reported in experiments55,56 and agrees
with our gas phase DFT calculations.53

The free-energy diagrams analysis of the monometallic pathways
above indicates that only pathway 1 is possible for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) to produce H2 in the
AN–water mixture, whereas both pathways 1 and 2 are possible
for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). The free-energy diagrams only provide thermodynamic
information. More analysis, such as kinetic properties of the reaction
pathway, is required to determine which pathway is more preferable.23,57 Our dynamic analysis of the proton transfer shows that the introduction
of the second electron to form CoIIH leads to the formation
of the proton transfer pathway from the liquid solvent to the Co center,
whereas such a pathway was not observed for the CoIIIH
state. This is due to the more negative charge of the active sites
of [CoIIH]− compared to that of [CoIIIH]0.18,53 Therefore, the monometallic
hydrogen production in pathway 1 should be more favorable than pathway
2 for both Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). This is also supported by the thermodynamic
hydricities calculations as will be presented in Section 3.4.

On the other hand,
pathway 5, where the monometallic reaction mechanism
involved the reduction of [CoI]− to [Co0]2–, cannot occur with the bias potential
as Eo(CoII/CoI)
for all the three cobaloximes in the AN–water mixture because
of the relatively lower reduction potential of CoI/Co0 (Table 1).
The Co0 species can only appear under very weak acidic
conditions where more negative applied potential is required to start
the reaction.3,58 Overall, our free-energy diagrams
analysis of the monometallic pathways supports that the most favorable
one involves alternate electron and proton addition (i.e., pathway
1) with the CoIIH species as one intermediate. This has
also been reported in many existing theoretical and experimental studies.8,10,15,20,23,59,60 It is noted that the reaction conditions considered
in this work are 1 M catalyst loading and pH = 0. For a chemical process
involving electron and proton transfer in solution, the free energy
profile of the reaction can be affected by the pH value and the catalyst
concentrations.20,23 For example, under a strong acidic
condition with a very low pH, the H+ can readily react
with CoIIIH, favoring pathway 2.

We also obtained
the free-energy diagrams of the bimetallic pathways
in the AN–water mixture referenced to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias potentials
(Figure 1b for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Figure 2b for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Figure 3b
for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)). The ones with the bias
potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) are shown in Figure 1d for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Figure 2d for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Figure 3d for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). The diagrams with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) show that both pathway 3
and pathway 4, which involve the reduction of CoII into
CoI and protonation of the latter to form CoIIIH, are thermodynamically favorable for these three cobaloximes. The
favorable bimetallic reaction of two CoIIIH was also observed
experimentally in the hydrogen-production study on the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex in pure AN.4,61 Similar
to the monometallic pathways, the bimetallic pathway involving the
reduction of CoI to Co0 (pathway 6) is not thermodynamically
possible under the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI).

3.3 Effect
of the Solvent on the Reaction Pathways
We focus in this
subsection on the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex to study
the effect of the solvent on the reaction pathways.
We calculated its reduction potentials and pKa values in pure AN, AN–water mixture, and pure water,
respectively. Figures S4 and S5 in the Supporting Information present the optimized geometries of reaction intermediates
in pure AN and pure water, respectively. As discussed earlier, the
complexes were situated in the implicit solvent of the respective
dielectric constants. Our results show that the reduction potentials
of the redox couples in the AN–water mixture are all higher
than those in pure AN. The reduction potentials become even larger
in pure water (Table 3). This means that the presence of water facilitates reduction of
the reaction intermediates.

Table 3 Reduction Potentials
and pKa Values of Co(dmgBF2)2 in Pure AN, 1-to-1 Mixing AN–Water Mixture,
and Pure Water
E vs NHE (V)	CoIII/CoII	CoII/CoI	CoI/Co0	CoIIIH/CoIIH	pKa1	pKa2	
AN	0.36	–1.26	–1.55	–1.01	9.04	18.33	
AN–water	0.85	–1.17	–1.41	–1.02	6.03	12.79	
water	1.27	–1.01	–1.22	–0.66	3.05	10.61	
We analyzed
the Hirshfeld charge distribution of the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex and found that the total charge of the
active sites (the Co ion, the 4 N atoms around it, and H bonded to
Co) stays nearly the same, independent of the solvent molecules coordinating
to the complex (Table S2 in the Supporting Information). The different reduction potentials with respect to the solvation
environment are resulted from the difference in the solvation energies.
Another factor is the use of the NHE references, which were calculated
to be 4.75, 4.62, and 4.50 V for the pure AN, AN–water mixture,
and pure water solvents, respectively. The smaller NHE values for
the AN–water mixture and pure water can contribute to the more
positive or less negative reduction potentials in the aqueous environment
than that for pure AN (Table 3). For the reduction potential of CoIII/CoII, the changes are much larger than the changes of NHE and
solvation energies from one solvation media to another. To explain
the significant change of the reduction potential of CoIII/CoII among different solvents, we analyzed the binding
energy of the solvent molecules to the CoIII and CoII species of the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex
and found that the significant change of the Eo(CoIII/CoII) with respect to different
solvation environments mainly results from the change in the binding
energies of the solvent molecules as the axial ligands, as shown in
Table S3 in the Supporting Information.
In all solvents, the total binding energies of the two axial ligands
to the Co center increases (i.e., less negative) as the Co is reduced
from CoIII to CoII. This is expected as the
axial ligands interact more weakly on reduction of the Co center.
This leads to the reduction process becoming less favorable. This
energy change during the reduction process (i.e., CoIII + e– ↔ CoII) is the least for
the case with pure water followed by the AN–water mixture and
by pure AN, which leads to the most prompt reduction in pure water,
followed by the case in AN–water and in pure AN. The change
of binding energy from one solvent to another is consistent with the
change of Eo(CoIII/CoII) (Table 3). More
details of the analysis of the binding energy of the solvent molecules
to the cobaloxime complexes can be found in Section S4 in the Supporting Information.

The pKa values for the acid dissociation
reaction of [CoIIIH]0 (pKa1) and [CoIIH]0 (pKa2) were calculated to be 6.03 and 12.79, respectively,
in the AN–water mixture. Their pKa values become 3.05 and 10.61, respectively, in pure water. Compared
with the values of pKa1 = 9.04 and pKa2 = 18.33 in pure AN, both [CoIIIH]0 and [CoIIH]− are more
likely to dissociate to form H+ and the corresponding base
in the aqueous medium (i.e., AN–water and pure water). This
should be resulted from the preferable solvation of H+ in
the water environment than in pure AN, with the G*(H(s)+) to be more negative in pure water
than in pure AN, as mentioned in Section 2.

Figures 4 and 5 show the free-energy
diagrams of the H2 generation pathways (Scheme 1) for Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure AN and pure
water, respectively. The diagrams that are referenced to Eo(H+/H2) without and with the Eo(CoII/CoI) bias potential
were plotted in a similar way as in the study in the AN–water
mixture in Section 3.2. For the monometallic reaction pathways in pure AN, both pathway
1 and pathway 2 are exothermic under the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (Figure 4c), suggesting that
both the pathways are thermodynamically favorable for Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure AN. This was also confirmed from the
experimental study of hydrogen production by Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure AN.4 The hydrogen production
process in pure AN contrasts with the results of hydrogen production
of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) in AN–water
mixture where pathway 2 is not favorable (Figure 1c). The monometallic reaction pathways for
Co(dmgBF2)2(H2O)(H2O)
in pure water are also thermodynamically favorable for pathway 1 but
not for pathway 2 (Figure 5c), which is similar to the case of the AN–water mixture.
Similar to Eo(CoIII/CoII) discussed above, the solvent environments also affect the
favorability of pathway 2 (i.e., [CoIIIH]0 +
H+ ↔ [CoIII]+ + H2). In particular, it is closely related to the change in binding
energy of the solvent molecules to the cobalt center at the reactant
and product states of pathway 2 (Table S3 in the Supporting Information). In pure AN, the larger decrease of
the binding energy of the two AN molecules from the [CoIIIH]0 to the [CoIII]+ species leads
to the more exothermic process, resulting in pathway 2 becoming more
energetically favorable compared to that in the AN–water mixture
and pure water. The favorable pathway 2 in pure AN could contribute
to the hydrogen production performance but more factors (e.g., energy
barriers of the reaction steps and solubility and concentration of
the protons and catalysts) would need to be considered to compare
the catalytic performance in different solvents, which is beyond the
scope of this work.

and (b,d) bimetallic of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(AN)

was calculated with respect to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias potential (a,b) and with
the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (c,d) for Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure
AN.

Figure 5 Free-energy diagrams of hydrogen production
pathways: (a,c) monometallic
and (b,d) bimetallic of Co(dmgBF2)2(H2O)(H2O) in pure water. Relative free-energy between the
electron-transfer steps was calculated with respect to Eo(H+/H2) without the bias potential
(a,b) and with the bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (c,d) for Co(dmgBF2)2 in pure water.

The free-energy profiles of the bimetallic pathways referencing
to Eo(H+/H2) without
bias potential (Figure 4b for pure AN and Figure 5b for pure water) and with bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) (Figure 4d for pure AN and Figure 5d for pure water) were also plotted and compared.
By looking at the bimetallic pathways with bias potential of Eo(CoII/CoI), we found
that pathway 3 and pathway 4 are all thermodynamically favorable in
pure AN (Figure 4d)
and pure water (Figure 5d), which is the same in the AN–water mixture (Figure 1d). Moreover, both monometallic
pathway 5 and bimetallic pathway 6 involving the reduction of CoI to Co0 are found to be unfavorable under the bias
potential of Eo(CoII/CoI) in pure AN (Figure 4c,d) and pure water (Figure 5c,d), which is similar to the case with the AN–water
mixture (Figure 1c,d).

3.4 Thermodynamic Hydricities of Cobaloxime Hydrides
We also calculated the thermodynamic hydricities of the hydride
intermediates of the three cobaloxime complexes to help us further
assess the catalytic performance of cobaloximes. Table 4 lists the thermodynamic hydricities,
or hydride donor abilities, of the hydride intermediates for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in implicit
AN–water mixture. Smaller thermodynamic hydricity or higher
hydride donor ability could contribute to the higher rate of electrocatalytic
hydrogen production.62 For all of these
cobalt complexes, the thermodynamic hydricity of the CoIIH intermediates is smaller than that of the CoIIIH intermediates
by ∼30–45 kcal/mol, which indicates much higher catalytic
activity of CoIIH than CoIIIH for hydrogen production.
Moreover, the hydride ions of CoIIIH and CoIIH could dissociate more readily for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) complexes
than Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), thus suggesting
higher catalytic hydrogen production activities of the former two
complexes. The more active CoIIIH species could lead to
pathway 2 becoming thermodynamically favorable to produce H2 for Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). On the other hand, the CoIIIH hydride
for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) must be
further reduced to be active enough to generate H2. Therefore,
this complex is only able to produce H2 via pathway 1 when
considering the monometallic pathways. The thermodynamic hydricity
study here allows us to better interpret the results of the reaction
pathways analysis in Figures 1–3.

Table 4 Thermodynamic
Hydricities (kcal/mol)
of the Hydride Intermediates for Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and
Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) in the AN–Water Mixture
cobalt complex	CoIIIH	CoIIH	
Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)H2O	66.4	22.6	
Co(dmgH)2ANH2O	54.5	20.9	
Co(dmgH)2(py)H2O	54.0	9.4	
The lower hydride donor ability of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) is resulted from the less negative
charges of
the active sites along the reaction (Table 2), making it more difficult to donate a negatively
charged hydride ion. The thermodynamic hydricities are very close
for the CoIIIH state of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). For the CoIIH state, Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) donates
the hydride ion more easily (Table 4). This is likely to be resulted from the effect of
the py ligand, donating electrons to the Co center at the CoIIH state (Figure S3 in the Supporting Information and Table 2).

3.5 Discussions on the Catalytic Performance of
Different Cobaloximes in the AN–Water Mixture
This
study examines the thermodynamic properties of three cobaloximes—Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O)—solvated
in the AN–water solvent by considering their reduction potentials,
pKa values, and thermodynamic hydricities.
The results show that Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) is reduced most readily, suggesting a lower overpotential
required for the electrocatalysis of this complex for hydrogen production.
On the other hand, the easier reduction of the molecular complex has
been suggested to be resulted from the less negative charge of the
active sites.30,31 This is also observed in our
study, thus making the positively charged proton more difficult to
transfer to the Co center and resulting in lower catalytic performance
for hydrogen production.4,55,59,63 Therefore, under the applied
potential of Eo(CoII/CoI), Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) would produce H2 more readily
because charges of the active sites of these two complexes are more
negative (Table 2),
leading to the lower thermodynamic hydricities for the CoIIIH and CoIIH intermediates (Table 4). Moreover, our previous ab initio molecular
dynamics simulation also demonstrated that the cobaloxime complexes
(i.e., Co(dmgH)2) with the O–H–O side-groups
have a much smaller free-energy barrier of the proton transfer from
the aqueous solvent to the Co center.18,53 For these
reasons, we identify that the Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) complexes are more
active for hydrogen production than Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O). The better catalytic hydrogen production performance
of Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl) compared to Co(dmgBF2)2 has been reported in experimental studies.12,55 The contrary effects of the reduction potential and catalytic performance
(i.e., turnover frequency), that is, higher reduction potentials leading
to lower catalytic activity and vice versa, are thus identified in
our theoretical study. This finding is in agreement with previous
experimental studies.4,55,59 Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) show very similar reduction and protonation
behaviors at the beginning of the hydrogen production reaction, as
displayed in the free-energy diagrams (Figures 2 and 3). The DFT calculations
in the gas phase suggest that at the state of CoIIH, the
coordination of the electron-donating py ligand is still present,
which could lead to the lower thermodynamic hydricity for Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) (Table 4), thus making it slightly more active for H2 generation compared to Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O).

4 Summary and Conclusions
This work presents
DFT calculations that reveal the reduction potentials,
pKa values, and thermodynamic hydricities
(hydride ion donor abilities) of three cobaloximes—Co(dmgBF2)2, Co(dmgH)2, and Co(dmgH)2(py)(Cl)—solvated in the 1-to-1 mixing AN–water mixture
during hydrogen production reactions. We also studied the properties
of Co(dmgBF2)2 solvated in pure AN and pure
water to study the effects of the solvent.

By comparing the
thermodynamic properties of the three cobaloxime
complexes solvated in the AN–water mixture, we found that the
more positive or less negative charges of the active sites of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) lead to higher reduction
potentials and smaller pKa values, which
is in agreement with previous research using the DFT method.30,31 In here, the active sites not only include the Co center but also
the N and H coordinated to Co, demonstrating the noninnocent behavior
of the surrounding atoms. On the other hand, the more positive or
less negative charges of the active sites of Co(dmgBF2)2(AN)(H2O) also result in the reduced hydride ion
donor abilities of the hydride species compared to those of Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O) and Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O). Compared with Co(dmgH)2(AN)(H2O), the electron-donating
py ligand of Co(dmgH)2(py)(H2O) results in more
active CoIIH species for H2 generation. The
relationship between the charge of the active sites and the redox
properties of the cobaloximes further indicates the key effect of
the coordination environment on the electronic properties and, thus,
the catalytic performance of the molecular catalysts16,59 and provides a way to facilitate the rational design of efficient
molecular catalysts by calculating a few parameters such as the reduction
potential and charge of the active sites.

Scheme 2 summarizes
the favorable reaction pathways of the three cobaloxime complexes
in different solvent environments in our study. The thermodynamic
analysis of the hydrogen production pathways based on the reduction
potentials and pKa values indicates that
the monometallic and bimetallic reaction pathways involving the reduction
of CoII to CoI and the formation of CoIIIH and CoIIH are the most likely pathways, which is consistent
with the previous theoretical and experimental results.4,10,12,18,20,23,61 For Co(dmgH)2 and Co(dmgH)2(py), H2 can be generated via both the CoIIIH and CoIIH species in the AN–water mixture.

Scheme 2 Favorable Hydrogen Production Pathways for the Co(dmgBF2)2 Co(dmgH)2 and Co(dmgH)2(py) Cobaloxime
Complexes
For Co(dmgBF2)2, the pathways are shown in the AN–water mixture, pure
AN, and pure water. For Co(dmgH)2 and Co(dmgH)2(py), the pathways are shown in the AN–water mixture. (The
superscripts next to the brackets are the charges of the species).

The important roles of the solvent in the thermodynamic
properties
and the energetic favorability of different reaction pathways were
identified by comparing the results of the Co(dmgBF2)2 complex in different solvents. The Co(dmgBF2)2 complex can produce H2 via the protonation of
both the CoIIIH and CoIIH species in pure AN.
Meanwhile, the reduction of CoIIIH to CoIIH
is necessary to produce H2 in the monometallic pathway
in the AN–water mixture or pure water (Scheme 2). The presence of water in the solvation
medium leads to higher reduction potentials and smaller pKa values. The effects of the solvent on the catalytic
process revealed in this work provide us a way to tune the hydrogen
production properties of the catalytic system by properly modulating
the solvation environments such as changing the composition of the
AN–water mixture. Moreover, the favorability of different reaction
pathways in the AN–water mixture, pure AN, and pure water are
significantly affected by the binding energies of AN and H2O to the cobalt center. This indicates the important role of axial
ligand coordination in the reaction, suggesting the possible catalyst
design strategy via the axial ligand modification in addition to the
choice of the side-group.

Overall, this work sheds light on
the effect of the coordination
states and solvation environments on the hydrogen production pathways
and contributes to our understanding of the reaction mechanism of
hydrogen-producing catalysts.
