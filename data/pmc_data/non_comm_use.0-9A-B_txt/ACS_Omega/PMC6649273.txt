Advancement in wireless technology
has increased the usage of wireless
devices extensively in the past few years, which led to an increase
in electromagnetic interference (EMI) in the environment. Extensive
research on fabrication of EMI shielding materials has been done.
However, the role of processing method of polymer composites in EMI
shielding has been neglected. In this work, we investigate the role
of two polymer processing methods, spin coating and compression molding,
in EMI shielding application. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) nanocomposites
with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT) were spin-coated onto glass
slides and compression-molded to a similar thickness. The processing
method that exhibited the best shielding was employed to fabricate
multiple PDMS composites comprising different compositions of MWCNT
and Fe3O4 and stacked to form a multilayered
EMI shielding PDMS composite. Scanning electron micrographs revealed
that MWCNT in spin-coated composites are significantly more agglomerated
than in the compression-molded film. Direct current conductivity and
curing temperature were higher in compression-molded films as the
filler formed a well-percolated network and hindered cross-linking
of polymer chains. EMI shielding results revealed that spin-coated
films demonstrated greater shielding effectiveness than compression-molded
composites in the Ku-band (12–18 GHz). Individual agglomerates
of MWCNT in spin-coated film attenuated incoming electromagnetic radiation
more effectively than well-dispersed MWCNT in compression-molded films.
Therefore, PDMS composites of different compositions of MWCNT and
Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared through spin
coating and stacked with a gradient of filler concentration, which
resulted in maximum shielding of −28 dB, i.e., shielding more
than 99% of incoming EM radiation by a 0.9 mm film.

Introduction
With the advent of wireless electronics
and rapid growth in electronics
and communication, interference of electromagnetic waves can no longer
be neglected. Recent technological advancements have led to the use
of a wide range of radio frequencies for reliable performance of wireless
devices and miniaturization of electronic components, making electrical
devices more compact every year. Hardware–software interfacing
through concepts such as Internet of Things promotes the use of wireless
communication in everyday life and advancement in mass production
of electronic devices, making it affordable to the masses. All of
these advancements have led to the use of high-energy electromagnetic
(EM) radiation, which interferes with EM radiation from other devices,
increasing electromagnetic interference (EMI) in our environment.
Interference of EM radiation with electronic components can lead to
malfunction, data loss, or complete impairment of the device.1−3 Although there have not been conclusive reports on the effects of
EMI on human beings, World Health Organization and International Agency
for Research on Cancer have classified radio frequency EM fields as
possibly carcinogenic and increasing the risk of malignant brain cancer
and glioma.4 Several measures have been
taken since the 20th century to reduce EMI through allocation of specific
bands of EM radiation and electromagnetic compatibility of electronic
devices, which is primarily through the shielding of the device of
interest.5

Shielding electronic components
with metals has been an old but
effective method in shielding EM radiation through reflection. Mobile
carriers in metals absorb EM radiation and release it in all directions,
resulting in scattering and a minuscule attenuation of incident radiation.6 As metals have abundant mobile carriers, they
are known to be the best EMI shielding materials and are still used
for EMI shielding in commercial electronic devices. However, their
corrosive nature, poor processability for encapsulation of miniaturized
components, and high cost had made polymer composites a better candidate
for EMI shielding. As polymers are mostly insulators and poor EMI
shielding materials, EMI shielding particles are added to the polymer.
The low cost, easy processability, and reusability of polymers, compounded
with the excellent magnetic, dielectric, and conducting properties
of filler materials, result in EMI shielding materials with good shielding
properties and industrial viability. Composites of acrylonitrile butadiene
styrene, polystyrene, polyethylene, poly(vinylidene flouride), etc.
with multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWCNT), graphene, ferrites, iron,
mu-metal, and mxene have been fabricated, some of which exhibit shielding
similar to metals.7−10

The extent of electromagnetic shielding exhibited by any material
is analyzed by measuring the transmission of electromagnetic waves
through the material termed as total shielding effectiveness (SET) expressed in decibels (dB). The theory of EMI shielding
was first developed by Schelkunoff, based on transmission line concepts
of reflection and transmission.11 The original
model explained shielding in homogeneous materials, which has been
modified to explain EMI shielding in heterostructures like multilayered,
porous, and composite materials.12−14 The total shielding
(SET) by any material can be differentiated into three
factors as shielding through reflection/scattering (SER), absorption (SEA), and multiple internal reflection
(SEM). SEM can be neglected when total shielding
is more than 10 dB.  The different forms
of shielding effectiveness
can be calculated from vector network analyzer (VNA) using scattering
parameters as follows      where Sij are the scattering parameters,
which can be deduced from transmission
and reflection coefficients of the material. Here, SER is
a complex function of intrinsic impedance and SEA is a
function of propagation constant of the material. To shield primarily
through absorption of EMI, the shielding material should show low
impedance mismatch with air and high propagation constant. Materials
with permanent dipoles like magnetic, dielectric, semiconductor, piezoelectric,
ferroelectric materials, etc. can absorb EMI. Polymer composites with
these fillers would exhibit excellent EMI shielding through absorption.
However, incorporation of the above-mentioned materials alone in the
polymer typically results in very low shielding as the entire system
lacks electrically percolation. Hence, a conducting network is essential
to shield EM waves through either reflection or absorption, which
results in a net shielding through scattering/absorption of EM waves.

While metals can be incorporated into the polymer matrix for the
formation of an electrically percolated network, carbonaceous materials
like carbon nanotubes and graphene stand as better alternatives for
the formation of conducting network in the polymer composite.15 The low density, high aspect ratio, high conductivity,
and abundant functional groups on the surface make MWCNT, graphene,
graphene oxide, and other carbonaceous materials prime candidates
for polymer nanocomposites. Magnetic particles have been frequently
used along with conducting materials in polymer composites to improve
absorption of EM radiation. Iron, iron oxide, and ferrites like cobalt,
manganese, and nickel are some of the materials studied extensively
and shielding mostly through absorption. Elastomeric EMI shielding
materials are useful in niche applications; however, research has
not been extensive compared to other polymers. High elasticity, chemical
inertness, and wide operational temperatures of silicone polymers
make them prime materials for diverse environments.16−18 Under the framework
of existing research on elastomeric EMI shielding materials are silicones
such as commonly used poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), which has been
used mostly for structural integrity of EMI shielding architecture.3,19−22

As most of the research was focussed on fabricating the best
EMI
polymer composites, the effect of different processing methods on
EMI shielding has not been extensive. Dispersion of filler material,
morphology of blends, and polymer–filler interaction can be
tailored through the processing method employed. It governs the mechanical,
electrical, thermal, and other properties and EMI shielding.23−26 However, study of the effect of processing on EMI shielding has
been scant.27−29 Alper et al. compared solution mixing with ultrasonication
and melt mixing of polyurethane composites.

While the choice
of filler dictates the extent of shielding, with
the use of appropriate design and architecture comprising different
fillers, shielding can be improved. Selective localization of magnetic
and conducting fillers in blends, foams, layer-by-layer stacking,
etc. is one of the few methods commercially being employed.9,15,30 Multilayered stacking using alternate
conducting and absorbing layers, concentration and thickness gradient,
etc. have shown excellent shielding compared to single composition
composites of the same thickness.31,32

In this
work, the role of processing method on EMI shielding was
studied. PDMS–MWCNT composite thin films were fabricated through
spin coating and compression molding. Composites fabricated by these
processing methods were studied to understand the cause for difference
in SET through characterization of the composites for electrical
conductivity, dispersion of MWCNT, etc. The better processing method was
employed to fabricate PDMS composites of Fe3O4 and MWCNT of different concentrations for construction of multilayered
architecture of PDMS composites with a gradient in the concentration
of fillers, which exhibited excellent SET.

Characterization
Fe3O4 particles were characterized through
FEI Technai F30 transmission electron microscopy (TEM) at an accelerating
voltage of 300 kV, and X’Pert Pro powder XRD system from PAN
analytical was used for determining the crystal structure, and Lakeshore
Vibratory Sample Magnetometer (VSM) was used for determining the magnetic
properties at room temperature with an applied force of −2000–2000
Oe.

Scanning electron micrograph of cryofractured PDMS composites
was
obtained using Carl Zeiss and ULTRA 55 field emission scanning electron
microscope at an accelerating voltage of 5 kV.

Thickness of
the composites was measured using a Leica Optical
microscope DM 2500-M by fixing the thin film vertically under the
objective lens and measuring across the cross section of the film.

Dirrect current (DC) conductivity of the thin films was measured
through the van der Pauw method by calculating the sheet resistance
using Agilent b1500 a semiconductor device analyzer.

Curing
temperature of the thin films was measured using Discovery
hybrid rheometer by TA Instruments. PDMS composite was placed between
parallel-plate geometry of 1 mm gap at a strain rate of 0.1 s–1, a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C/min from 30
°C, and an angular frequency of 1 rad/s.

The mechanical
properties of the thin-film composites were characterized
through nanoindentation using Hysitron TI 900 Tribo Indenter with
a spherical indenter. A dwell time of 10 s and a constant load of
10 μN were used.

EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) of the
polymer composites was
measured using an Anritsu VNA MS4642A in the X-band region (12–18
GHz).

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Fe3O4 Nanoparticles
Materials with magnetic and electric diploes
typically absorb EM
radiation and reduce the release of EM radiation into the environment
compared to conducting particles, which reflect EM radiation back
into the atmosphere. Ferromagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were synthesized through the hydrothermal process and used as an EM
absorber in PDMS composites. The morphology of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was characterized using bright-field transmission
electron microscopy techniques, as presented in Figure 1. Figure 1a of Fe3O4 nanoparticles confirm
spherical morphology with size varying between 400 and 600 nm and
indicating that each nanoparticle is polycrystalline, comprising fine
grains of Fe3O4, which can be seen in Figure 1c. Crystal structures
of Fe3O4 nanoclusters were further analyzed
through X-ray diffraction. In Figure 2a, X-ray diffraction pattern system confirms the spinel
structure of Fe3O4 and the peaks (220), (311),
(400), (422), (511), (440), and (533) were identified and match the
peaks of fcc lattice (JCPDS no. 88-0866). Magnetic hysteresis of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was obtained through room-temperature
VSM (Figure 2b), showing
a coercivity of 154 Oe, remnant magnetization of 11.4 emu g–1, and saturation magnetization (MS) of 61.7 emu g–1 depicting its strong magnetization characteristics.

Dispersion of MWCNT in PDMS Composites
Properties of
polymer composites can often be controlled by the processing method
employed. It determines the dispersion of filler in the polymer, localization
of fillers in case of blends, chemical interaction between polymer
and filler, etc., which consecutively determines elasticity, brittleness,
electrical conductivity, SE, and several other properties of the polymer
composites. In the realm of EMI shielding, the state of fillers determines
the extent of shielding as most of the polymers are insulators, which
can be characterized through electron microscopy. To understand the
role of processing in EMI shielding, PDMS composites comprising 3
wt % MWCNT have been spin-coated onto a glass substrate and compression-molded
to produce spin-coated and compression-molded thin films, respectively.
The thin films were cryofractured and imaged using scanning electron
microscopy. SEM images of these composites in Figure 3 showed that MWCNTs are well dispersed in
compression-molded films, compared to spin-coated films, which have
large agglomerates of MWCNT. The presence of agglomerates in spin-coated
films can be attributed to the difference in processing conditions
of the composites, as mechanical mixing does not disperse MWCNT completely
compared to ultrasonication.

Figure 3 SEM images of 3 wt % MWCNT PDMS composite thin
films processed
through (a, b) compression molding and (c, d) spin coating. MWCNTs
are well dispersed in compression-molded film, while agglomerates
of MWCNT are seen in spin-coated film.

DC Conductivity of PDMS Composites
Electrical conductivity
is a necessary criterion for a material to exhibit EMI shielding,
through either reflection or absorption. An electrical percolation
in a polymer composite is paramount for EMI shielding. However, improved
electrical conductivity in a composite does not imply an improvement
in shielding because conductivity assists in shielding indirectly
through formation of an electrical network, while the filler material
attenuates EM radiation.6,33,34 DC conductivity of spin-coated and compression-molded thin films
was measured through the van der Pauw method. As shown in Figure 4a, well-dispersed
compression-molded film exhibited a conductivity of 7.2 × 101 S/cm, while the spin-coated composite exhibits 4.1 ×
10–1 S/cm, nearly 2 orders of magnitude lower than
the compression-molded film. It is envisaged that the spin-coated
composite show lower electrical conductivity due to the presence of
agglomerates. However, the conductivity of spin-coated composite is
substantial enough to accept that a well-percolated network off MWCNT
and the agglomerates exists in the composite film. As we know that
conductivity increases with frequency of applied voltage, in GHz range,
both the films are expected to have similar electrical conductivity,
even though they exhibited different SE.  where
ω is the angular frequency, σDC is the direct
electrical conductivity, A is the temperature-dependent
constant, and n is
the exponent. The exponent is the measure of the three-dimensional
(3D) network of capacitor or resistor and depends on both frequency
and temperature, and the value is in the range of 0–1. Hence,
electrical conductivity must be used to determine the extent of percolation
in the system only.

Figure 4 (a) DC conductivity of spin-coated and compression-molded
films.
Although the spin-coated film exhibited lower DC conductivity compared
to the compression-molded film, it exhibited a well-percolated network
of MWCNT as it showed a conductivity of 0.4 S/cm. (b) Complex viscosity
of neat PDMS and PDMS–MWCNT composites processed through compression
molding and spin coating across a temperature range to identify gelation
point (onset of curing temperature). Neat PDMS began curing earlier
than PDMS–MWCNT composites and spin-coated composite cured
earlier than compression-molded composite as MWCNTs are agglomerated
in spin-coated composite and absorb heat poorly compared to well-dispersed
MWCNT in compression-molded composite.

Curing of PDMS Composites
Addition of fillers affects
polymer properties like mechanical strength, viscosity, etc. Although
the effects are favorable in some properties, they can be also detrimental,
especially on processing properties such as viscosity, Tg, etc., which control energy consumption during manufacturing.
The effect of processing methods on curing of PDMS–MWCNT composites
is studied through rheology of uncured PDMS composites. Complex viscosity
of PDMS composites processed through spin coating and compression
molding was measured from 40 to 80 °C. An increase in viscosity
indicated the onset of curing, which can be seen in Figure 4b. Both spin-coated and compression-molded
composites showed very high viscosity compared to neat PDMS due to
the presence of MWCNT, which hinder the motion of polymer chains.
The onset of curing was higher in the composites with MWCNT as it
hinders cross-linking through absorption of heat by MWCNT. The curing
temperatures of compression-molded composite and spin-coated composite
are similar, indicating that the processing method did not influence
the curing kinetics of the composites.

Mechanical Properties
Mechanical properties are essential
for understanding the application of the materials in different environments,
durability, and their life time. As the spin-coated composite film
is adhered to a glass substrate, which cannot be separated, it limits
the extent of characterization for mechanical properties to surface
characterizations. Hardness of the composites was measured through
nanoindentation using a spherical indenter at a constant load of 10
μN. Table 1 shows
the surface hardness and reduced modulus of the spin-coated and compression-molded
composites to be on the order of mega pascals. PDMS being an elastomer
exhibits low hardness, which was marginally increased by the addition
of MWCNT. From Table 1, we see that the compression-molded composite exhibits better hardness
compared to the spin-coated composite due to relatively better dispersion
of MWCNT. However, the spin-coated composite shows greater deviation
compared to the compression-molded composite, which can be attributed
to the presence of agglomerates of MWCNT, which produce higher hardness
compared to the matrix (PDMS in this context) when the indenter indents
the agglomerates.

EMI Shielding of PDMS Composites
The effect of processing
method on EMI SE was studied comparing SE of spin-coated and compression-molded
thin films. PDMS composite thin films comprising 3 wt % MWCNT were
fabricated through spin coating and compression molding. Spin-coated
composite film was fabricated on a glass substrate and used along
with the substrate for all of the characterizations, as the thin film
adhered strongly to the substrate while compression-molded film was
a free-standing thin film. However, the glass substrate did not contribute
to SET, which was verified by measuring SE of plain glass
slide, compression-molded film along with the glass substrate, and
free-standing compression-molded film, as shown in Figure 5a. We saw that the glass substrate
showed zero dB of shielding and SET values of both the
free-standing film and the glass substrate were very similar, implying
that the glass substrate did not contribute to SET. SET values of spin-coated and compression-molded films were measured
as shown in Figure 5b. The compression-molded composite despite being 30 μm thicker
than spin-coated film showed −7.5 dB of shielding, while the
spin-coated film showed −13.5 dB. Hence, we propose that agglomerates
of MWCNT in spin-coated film are assisting in shielding. DC conductivity
of the composite films showed that the compression-molded film exhibited
higher conductivity but shielded poorly compared to the spin-coated
film. The spin-coated film exhibited a conductivity of 0.4 S/cm, and
such a magnitude of electrical conductivity is possible only if it
contains a percolated network. The agglomerates of MWCNT appear to
behave as attenuating sites in the polymer composite, which are electrically
connected to each other forming an electrically percolated network
of MWCNT agglomerates. When an electromagnetic wave passes through
both the composites, it gets attenuated significantly when it encounters
agglomerates of MWCNT compared to interacting with several individual
MWCNTs. Hence, the difference in shielding in these composite films
was due to the difference in frequency of interaction of the incident
electromagnetic wave with MWCNT as it propagated through the composite.
This clearly demonstrates that despite having the same filler content,
the polymer composites exhibited discrete EMI shielding performances,
demonstrating the effect of polymer processing method on EMI shielding
performance.(Figure 6)

Figure 5 (a) SET of 3 wt % MWCNT PDMS composite film processed
through compression molding, glass substrate, and compression-molded
film along with glass substrate to check the effect of glass substrate
on EMI shielding. The plain glass substrate showed negligible shielding
and stacking along with a compression-molded film that did not change
SET of the glass film system, indicating that the glass
substrate did not contribute to shielding (b) SET of 3
wt % MWCNT PDMS composite thin film processed through compression
molding and spin coating. The spin-coated sample showed an average
shielding of −13.5 dB, while the compression-molded film showed
−7 dB. The thickness of the spin-coated film was 150 μm,
while the thickness of the compression-molded film was 180 μm.
The compression-molded film, despite being 30 μm thicker than
the spin-coated film, exhibited poor shielding.

Figure 6 Schematic illustrating the mechanism of shielding in spin-coated
and compression-molded composites. The agglomerates in spin-coated
composite attenuate EM radiation extensively through extensive interaction
of EM radiation with MWCNT due to dense packing in the agglomerates.
The attenuation is less in compression-molded films due to reduced
interaction of EM radiation with MWCNT.

While spin coating is a lab-scale process, composites processed
through this method exhibited better shielding compared to compression-molded
composites, which is a well-established industrial process for manufacturing
on a commercial scale. Spin coating has been employed for the fabrication
all of the composites here off as it gives better shielding. PDMS
composite thin films with different compositions of Fe3O4 and MWCNT were fabricated through spin coating to achieve
higher SE primarily through absorption (Table 2). Fe3O4 has been extensively studied as EMI shielding material,
shielding primarily through absorption. Table 3 comprises PDMS composites fabricated through
spin coating with varied composition of fillers, their thickness,
and SET. While it is known that addition of magnetic particles
improves SET from Figure 7a and Table 3, we see that SET of composites with magnetic particles
was less than SET of composites without magnetic particles
because addition of magnetic particles improves shielding through
absorption and does not improve the total shielding. From Figure 7a, we see that PDMS–Fe3O4 composites without MWCNT showed zero shielding
due to the absence of an electrically percolated network, which implies
that electrical percolation is one of the necessary conditions for
shielding. Multilayered PDMS composites were fabricated through physical
stacking of spin-coated composites. Multilayered composites typically
show better shielding due to increased attenuation of EM waves through
impedance mismatch at the interface of two films. A greater impedance
mismatch increases the reflectance of EM waves into the composite
resulting in improved attenuation of the EM wave before it propagates
through the multilayered stack. Three multilayered composites were
fabricated using different compositions with a gradient in concentration
of filler as mentioned in Table 4, having a thickness of 900 μm. These multilayered
composites exhibit SET in 20–28 dB range, which
is equivalent to shielding more than 99% (>−20 dB) of incoming
radiation, as seen in Figure 7b. The total shielding effectiveness achieved through multilayered
stacking is one of the best results in the literature, as shown in Table 5, which compares average
SET of PDMS composite thin films from the literature with
the current work (Figure 6, Table 2,
and Figure 8).

Figure 7 (a) SET of PDMS composites processed through spin coating.
Addition of Fe3O4 showed zero shielding, which
was due to the absence of an electrically percolated network. (b)

of −28 dB, i.e., blocking 99.6% of incoming EM radiation. The
composition of multilayered composite films is tabulated in Table 3.

Conclusions
The
effect of processing method on EMI shielding was investigated
by processing PDMS–MWCNT composites through compression molding
and spin coating. Agglomerates of MWCNT electrically percolated in
spin-coated composite showed better attenuation of EM radiation compared
to well-dispersed MWCNT in compression-molded composite. This concludes
that, despite exhibiting high DC conductivity, compression-molded
composite shielded poorly compared to spin-coated composite. The effect
of glass substrate has been studied, and it was concluded that it
did not contribute to SET although it was dielectric in
nature. While addition of Fe3O4 reduced SET of the composite, from previous research work on Fe3O4, it was concluded that percent absorption of EM radiation
had increased. Ultimately, stacks of different PDMS composites across
the concentration gradient resulted in a maximum SET of
−28 dB, which is equivalent to blocking nearly 99.9% (∼30
dB) of incoming EM radiation.

Experimental Section
Materials
Vinyl-terminated
linear poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) (viscosity, 65 Pa s) and curing agent comprising hydrogen siloxane
fluid, Pt-curing catalyst, and inhibitor were kindly provided by Momentive
performance materials. MWCNT was purchased from Nanocyl, NC7000 (average
diameter: 9.5 nm; average length: 1.5 μm). Tetrahydrofuran (THF),
ethylene glycol, dichloromethane (DCM), sodium acetate (CH3COONa), and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) were
purchased from S D Fine-Chem Limited. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-4000)
was purchased from SRL Chemicals, and FeCl3·6H2O was purchased from Thomas Baker.

Fe3O4 Nanoparticle Synthesis
Fe3O4 nanoparticles
were synthesized through
hydrothermal method.40 FeCl3·6H2O (6 mmol) was dissolved in 40 mL of glycol.
Further, 1 g of PEG-4000 and 43 mmol sodium acetate was added to the
solution and stirred vigorously for 30 min. The mixture was then transferred
into a Teflon autoclave and placed in a hot-air oven at 200 °C
for 24 h. A black precipitate was collected with a permanent magnet,
washed with ethanol, distilled water several times, and finally dried
in a vacuum oven at 100 °C.

Composite Preparation
MWCNTs were dispersed in THF
through probe sonication for 15 min, followed by bath sonication for
15 min. Fe3O4 nanoparticles were also dispersed
in THF through bath sonication. The solutions were mixed and sonicated
for 45 min to ensure homogeneous dispersion of the particles. In composite where Fe3O4 was not included, MWCNT was further sonicated for 45
min to ensure equivalent sonication time of filler materials in all
of the composites.41 PDMS added to the
solution was processed as shown below for compression molding and
spin coating (Figure 9).

through different processing methods. (a) Compression molding and
(b) spin coating.

Compression Molding
The dispersed filler solution was
mixed with PDMS solution, bath sonicated for 1 h, and left under the
hood for the solvent to evaporate. Curing agent was added to the composite
and compression-molded at 100 °C and 10 Psi to form 150 μm
composite thin film.

Spin Coating
The dispersed filler
solution was mixed
with PDMS using a Heidolph mechanical mixer at 300 rpm for 2 h along
with Soniclean bath sonicator to remove bubbles formed during mechanical
mixing. The polymer composite solution was left under the hood for
the solvent to evaporate. Curing agent was added to the polymer composite
solution while it retained some solvent to give the solution slightly
viscous consistency. The composite solution was then poured onto a
glass slide and spin-coated in a spinNXG-P1 to 150 μm thick
composite film. These PDMS composite spin-coated glass slides were
cured in a hot-air oven at 120 °C for 20 min.
