This
work is a systematic ab initio study of the influence of spin
state and cation distribution on the stability, dielectric constant,
electronic band gap, and density of states of ternary transition-metal
oxides. As an example, the chemical family of spinel ferrites MFe2O4, with M = Mg, Sc–Zn is chosen. Dielectric
constant and band gap are calculated for various spin states and cation
configurations via dielectric-dependent self-consistent hybrid functionals
and compared to available experimental data. When choosing the most
stable spin state and cation configuration, the calculated electronic
properties are in reasonable agreement with measured values. The nature
of the excitation is investigated through projected density of states.
A pronounced dependence of band gap energy and dielectric constant
on the spin state and cation configuration is observed, which is a
possible explanation for the large variation of the experimental results,
in particular, if several states are energetically close.

Introduction
It has been shown previously
that the quantum-chemical calculation
of properties of open-shell transition-metal oxides represents a challenge,
even for state-of-the-art computational methods.1 Transition-metal oxides are interesting candidates for
many applications because of their versatile chemistry, such as photoelectrochemical
water splitting,2 spintronics,3 and many more. Theoretical modeling of these
systems allows for the investigation of properties that are difficult
to access experimentally, such as the nature of excitation or the
effect of geometrical changes on the electronic structure. Furthermore,
it is possible to investigate compounds that have not been synthesized
yet, or the effect of ion distribution on the electronic structure,
which is experimentally difficult to obtain. Thus, it is of general
interest to find theoretical methods that are suitable to treat these
compounds.

Standard density functional theory (DFT) functionals
based on the
localized-density approximation (LDA) or generalized-gradient approximation
(GGA) have been successfully applied to a wide range of materials.
However, properties of strongly correlated systems, particularly transition-metal
oxides with a problematic electronic structure, are often not predicted
reliably. Additionally, certain electronic properties such as the
fundamental band gap are known to pose a problem in calculation. A
major contribution to this error arises from the self-interaction
error due to the approximate nature of the exchange term in LDA and
GGA functionals. Most of the published computational studies of transition-metal
oxides thus rely on the one-center Hubbard U correction
(DFT + U)4 because of
its superior computational efficiency compared to hybrid methods.
The DFT + U method has been applied frequently to
calculate properties of the class of spinel ferrites.5−30 The correction parameter U can in principle be
calculated self-consistently from first principles,31 but is in most cases adjusted empirically and has to be
optimized individually for each compound and every (d-) element. Thus,
the predictive power of this approach is limited. Therefore, we decided
to employ a different theoretical framework. The calculation of the
fundamental band gap is usually approximated by the energy difference
between the lowest unoccupied and the highest occupied one-particle
energy level. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that hybrid methods
give more accurate ionization energies and electron affinities within
the one-particle approximation than GGA functionals due to a reduction
of the self-interaction error.32 In principle,
the amount of Fock exchange in the hybrid exchange functional (eq 1) can also be treated as
an empirical parameter. 1  

In this work, we apply a technique
where α is obtained from
first principles. Previous work33−36 showed that dielectric-dependent self-consistent
hybrid (ddsch) methods37,38 provide high accuracy for electronic
band gaps and absolute band positions. In this work, we therefore
applied ddsch methods, where the Fock exchange fraction α is
self-consistently calculated from the static dielectric constant38 as 2  

In this work, we applied an implementation suggested by Erba,38 which includes a fully automated self-consistent
calculation of α from the dielectric constant by adopting a
coupled-perturbed-Hartree–Fock/Kohn–Sham (CPHF/KS) approach.
Using this procedure, every compound as well as every cation and spin
distribution will be treated with an optimal fraction of exchange.
As we will show in the following, cation and spin distribution have
a strong effect on electronic properties of the ferrites, making this
feature crucial.

However, it has to be clarified, that using
the one-electron KS
levels to deduce the band gap of magnetic insulators with highly localized
3d orbitals is only an approximation. Systems with strongly correlated
electrons cannot be described accurately by the single-determinant
Ansatz of DFT. Physically more sound results are obtained with the
GW method32,39 or the dynamical mean-field theory.40 However, these approaches are computationally
too demanding to investigate the large number of systems considered
in this study. The aim of this work is not to predict or reproduce
experimental band gaps, but to emphasize the influence of cation distribution
and magnetic state on the electronic properties. Additionally, the
multi-reference character of all MFe2O4 compounds
with M being a d0 or d10 element is not very
pronounced because of the rather stable high spin d5 configuration
of Fe3+.

The investigated material class of spinel
ferrites MFe2O4 (M = Mg, Sc–Zn) represents
a systematic test
set of transition-metal oxides including all d-elements of the 4th
period and a d0 element (Mg). CaFe2O4, as the fourth-row “d0-ferrite”, crystallizes
in an orthorhombic space group and was therefore not considered.

The selected ferrites, as far as they are experimentally investigated,
crystallize in the cubic space group Fd3̅m (spinel structure). Oxygen forms a cubic close-packed
lattice where M and Fe occupy one-eighth of tetrahedral (8a) and half
of the octahedral (16d) states. The structural formula can be written
as [M1–yFey]T[MyFe2–y]OO4, where the superscripts
T and O denote the tetrahedral and octahedral sites, respectively.
In this notation, the cation distribution parameter y is also called the degree of inversion. A spinel with y = 0 is considered perfectly normal, while y = 1
denotes a fully inverse spinel. The cation distribution depends on
M as well as the synthesis conditions.41 In real systems, the degree of inversion is neither exactly 1 nor
exactly 0, so that 0 < y < 1. An example for
a normal spinel is ZnFe2O4 for which a degree
of inversion of y < 1% was reported,42 but it was also shown that the degree of inversion
is extremely dependent on the synthesis conditions.43 An example for an inverse spinel is NiFe2O4 with a degree of inversion close to 100%.44

Not only the cation distribution, but also spin and
charge distribution
depend on the nature of M. It is generally accepted that spinel ferrites
with M = Mg, Zn are antiferromagnets. If M is a d5–d9 element, the resulting spinel ferrite is a ferrimagnet, but
also other spin configurations are possible.

Spinel ferrites
with M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr have been scarcely investigated
so far. In general cation, charge and spin distributions are therefore
not known as well. Hence, all unique spin states and cation distributions
with y = 0, 1 within the primitive unit cells (PUCs)
were tested in the present work.

Results and Discussion
Investigated
Configurations
The investigated spin states
depend on the cation distribution as well as the oxidation state of
M. While for the oxidation states II and IV, there are only two possible
cation distributions in the PUC, where M is either in tetrahedral
or in octahedral positions, the situation is more complicated for
MIII. For the oxidation state MIII, FeII and FeIII ions are present, whose distribution has to
be accounted for. All of the investigated occupancies are displayed
in Table 1 and denoted
by the letters A to G. To decrease the computational effort, no partial
inversion was accounted for, so that y = 0, 1 for
every occupancy. Normal and inverse spinels correspond to configuration
A and B, respectively. For y = 0 and 1, every unique
cation distribution in the PUC was considered. Table 2 shows the related spin distributions together
with an acronym, where “fm” indicates ferromagnetism,
“afm” indicates antiferromagnetism, and “fi”
indicates ferrimagnetism. If M is a d0 or d10 element, no spin was considered and the respective assignment for
M in Table 2 can be
ignored. The final nomenclature for the investigated states is composed
of the variant of cation distribution from Table 1 and the acronym of the spin state from Table 2. An overview of the
resulting configurations can be found in the Supporting Information.

Important Configurations
The cation and spin configurations
introduced above were set up for the PUC of MFe2O4 with M = Mg, Sc–Zn. While keeping the cubic symmetry, full
structural relaxations were carried out using PW1PW and effective
core potential (ECP) basis sets. For the relaxed structures, ddsch
calculations with ECP and also triple-ζ basis sets were performed.
The complete set of the results can be found in the Supporting Information. From these results, it is evident
that the calculated dielectric constant and thus the amount of Fock
exchange are dependent on the basis set. While providing a stable
SCF procedure, in particular during geometry optimization, the rather
small ECP basis sets lead to strong overestimations of the band gaps.
Therefore, the final calculation of the band gap was performed with
the larger rev2-pob-TZVP basis sets. Hence, only the relative stabilities
(calculated with standard PW1PW), dielectric constants (ddsch), and
band gaps (ddsch) obtained with the triple-ζ basis set are listed
in Tables 3 and 4. The most relevant spin configurations were chosen
by an energy difference of maximum 20 kJ/mol.

Results for
M = Mg, Mn–Zn
Results for configurations
of spinels with M = Mg, Mn–Zn within this energy range are
listed in Table 3 together
with optical dielectric constants and a range of experimental band
gaps from the literature. A more detailed list of the experimental
gaps, including measurement temperature, method, and particle shape
and size, can be found in the Supporting Information, Table S4. Because all of the experimental gaps are obtained from
optical measurements, the calculated fundamental gaps cannot be directly
compared. The energy of excited states is always smaller than the
electronic gap because of excitonic effects. Thus, the optical gap
is usually smaller than the fundamental gap. Exceptions can occur
because of selection rules, for example, when the lowest excited states
are symmetry forbidden. The excitonic binding energy of transition-metal
oxides varies between a few millielectron volts45 and several tenth of an electron volts.46

As Table 3 shows, all of the compounds, except MnFe2O4, feature several cation configurations and spin states that
have to be considered.

In the most stable configuration of MgFe2O4, the magnesium atoms occupy octahedral states,
and the iron atoms
in tetrahedral positions couple with iron atoms in octahedral positions.
For this configuration, a band gap of 3.57 eV was calculated. This
overestimation of the highest experimental band gap by 1.14 eV cannot
be explained by excitonic effects. The other configurations which
have to be considered exhibit a different antiferromagnetic coupling
with the same cation distribution as well as a ferromagnetic configuration
with magnesium in tetrahedral positions. For those configurations,
the band gaps are quite similar, 3.45 and 3.56 eV, respectively. Mössbauer
spectra have shown that MgFe2O4 is a mixed spinel
with preference for inverse cation distribution.44 The required energy to shift a Mg2+ ion from
a tetrahedral to an octahedral site was found as 0.14 eV = 13.5 kJ/mol.
This is consistent with the calculated energy difference between the
states B-fi4 and A-afm1 of 21.2 kJ/mol (see Supporting Information, Table S2). The magnetic moment was measured to
be μB ≠ 0,44 which
is most probably because of the incomplete inversion of the material.

For MnFe2O4 only one configuration matches
the selected energy criterion. Here, manganese atoms occupy tetrahedral
positions and couple ferrimagnetically with the iron atoms in octahedral
sites. With a calculated band gap of 1.07 eV, the resulting band gap
is close to the lower limit of the experimental range. The present
results are in accordance to neutron diffraction measurements, which
show that MnFe2O4 exhibits a predominantly normal
cation distribution with y ≈ 0.8 while coupling
ferrimagnetically.44

For magnetite
(Fe3O4), the experimental results
for the electronic structure vary strongly, ranging from a conducting
system up to a semiconductor with a band gap of 1.92 eV. Except for
a ferrimagnetic state, where FeII atoms occupy octahedral
positions, the considered configurations are all predicted to be conducting.
Here, a band gap of 0.91 eV was obtained. While it is generally accepted
that Fe3O4 is an inverse spinel, experimental
results show indications for an average charge of +2.5 of iron in
octahedral positions80 as well as a charge
separation to +2 and +3,81 depending on
the temperature. Because the present results rely on calculations
at 0 K, a charge separation was to be expected but has only been observed
for configuration B-fi2, which exhibits two symmetry-inequivalent
iron atoms in the octahedral positions due to the spin alignment.
In experiment, Fe3O4 shows ferrimagnetic coupling
between tetrahedrally and octahedrally coordinated iron atoms.81 This corresponds to configuration B-fi1 which
only differs from the most stable configuration by 5 kJ/mol.

CoFe2O4 also displays four different combinations
of cation and spin distribution within the chosen energy range. In
the most stable one, cobalt atoms occupy octahedral sites. Iron and
cobalt atoms in the octahedral positions couple ferrimagnetically
with iron atoms in tetrahedral positions. A corresponding spin configuration
with cobalt atoms in tetrahedral positions, as well as two states
with a net magnetic moment of 0, either with cobalt in octahedral
or tetrahedral positions, are considered. All of the calculated band
gaps fit within the experimental range. However, as shown in Table
S4 in the Supporting Information, there
are two experimental ranges for the band gap, 1.17–1.58 and
2.44–2.62 eV, respectively. These results most probably correspond
to the respective indirect and direct transition.60 Hence, assuming excitonic effects to be small, only the
calculated band gaps for B-fi1 and B-fi4 are in the correct range.
Experimental results indicate that CoFe2O4 is
largely inverse with y = 0.76–0.93 and shows
ferrimagnetic coupling.44 Moving a Co2+ ion from an octahedral to a tetrahedral site requires an
energy of 0.19 eV = 18.3 kJ/mol. This differs from the calculated
energy difference between configuration B-fi1 and A-fi1 (4.1 kJ/mol),
which is lower, but the preference for inverse cation distribution
as well as the ferrimagnetism is reproduced in accordance with the
experiment.

For NiFe2O4, two energetically
close configurations
were identified, both with nickel atoms occupying octahedral sites
and ferrimagnetic spin ordering. Mössbauer spectra determined
the degree of inversion of NiFe2O4 to be close
to 100% with a magnetic moment of 2.20μB per chemical
formula unit, which indicates a ferrimagnetic coupling between tetrahedral
and octahedral sites.44 This corresponds
to the most stable configuration B-fi1. Again, the measured band gaps
show a high variation, but in contrast to CoFe2O4, the results cannot be divided in two groups (see Supporting Information, Table S4). Both of the calculated
band gaps, 1.82 and 2.27 eV, are within the experimental range.

According to the calculations, CuFe2O4 has
two relevant configurations, in which copper atoms occupy octahedral
lattice sites. Both of them are ferrimagnetic (fi1 and fi3). In this
case, the range of the calculated (0.11 eV) and experimental (0.24
eV) band gaps is rather small. The difference between measured and
calculated values, 0.31–0.66 eV, is consistent with large excitonic
effects. However, because the SCF stability for CuFe2O4 was not satisfactory, these results have to be considered
with caution. Depending on the synthesis route, CuFe2O4 was shown to be mostly inverse with y =
0.74–1.82 In a different experimental
study, it was shown that CuFe2O4 exhibits a
ferrimagnetic nature that can be changed to superparamagnetic behavior
by the synthesis conditions.83 Both inverse
cation distribution and the ferrimagnetism are reproduced correctly
by the presented results.

When surveying the experimental band
gap of ZnFe2O4, two clusters of values, one
in the range of 1.78–2.01
eV and another one in the range of 2.61–3.25 eV, can be found,
similar to CoFe2O4. Yet, unlike to CoFe2O4, these results may not be assigned to the indirect
and direct band gap whose energy difference is only ∼0.1 eV.76 A possible explanation would be the presence
of oxygen defects in some experiments, which are not covered by the
stoichiometric models used in the calculations. This explanation is
supported by the findings of Sultan and Singh.78 Experimentally, ZnFe2O4 was shown
to be an antiferromagnetic normal spinel with a degree of inversion
below 1%;42 however, the degree of inversion
is extremely dependent on the synthesis conditions.43 While the cation ordering is reproduced correctly by the
presented results, the ferromagnetic solution is more stable than
the antiferromagnetic one by 2.2 kJ/mol. The same result was gained
by previous theoretical work84 on hybrid-DFT
level of theory (PBE0) with an energetic preference of 0.030 eV =
2.9 kJ/mol for the ferromagnetic state.

Apart from the band
gap, the ddsch approach also delivers another
physical property, the static dielectric constant ε (Table 3). The experimental
dielectric constants of MnFe2O4 (4.24 and 4.84)
and CuFe2O4 (4.37 and 5.15) in the study by
Vasuki and Balu53 deviate significantly
from the calculated dielectric values of MnFe2O4 A-fi1 with 6.48, and CuFe2O4 B-fi1 (B-fi3)
with 7.37 (6.72). Yet, the optical band gaps obtained in this study,
5.98 eV for MnFe2O4 and 5.63 eV for CuFe2O4, vary strongly from other published values (see Supporting Information, Table S4), so the severity
of this divergence should be considered cautiously. A qualitative
result from ref (52) is that the measured value of the dielectric constant is very sensitive
to the determination of the refraction index, which was done via the
Moss formula85 and relations suggested
by Anani et al.86 The results of Chand
et al.59 for CoFe2O4 (6.66), NiFe2O4 (5.52), and ZnFe2O4 (5.76) are in better agreement with the respective
theoretical values of 6.76, 6.42, and 4.47, especially for CoFe2O4. However, it has to be mentioned that the experimental
band gaps for NiFe2O4 (3.54 eV) and ZnFe2O4 (3.25 eV) in this study are again rather high.

Results for M = Sc–Cr
The same methodology was
applied to predict the electronic properties of the remaining members
of the first-row transition-metal ferrites MFe2O4. Table 4 shows the
relative stability, dielectric constant, and band gap for the most
stable configurations with M = Sc–Cr.

The dielectric
constant for the different configurations of ScFe2O4, 4.83–5.07, is relatively insensitive to the cation
and spin distribution, but their impact on the band gap is significant.
While the two ferrimagnetic configurations E-fi2 and D-fi1 have a
relatively large band gap of 2.81 eV, the antiferromagnetic configuration
has a band gap of only 1.85 eV.

In TiFe2O4, the most stable configurations
F-afm1 and G-fm contain a tetravalent Ti and divalent Fe, which is
in agreement with the literature.87 According
to our results, TiFe2O4 is either a conductor
or it shows a pronounced band gap of 3.18 eV, depending on the cation
and spin distribution. This result is supported by previous works,
where an experimental band gap of 2.0 eV88 is reported, while a theoretical study on the GGA level of theory
by Liu et al. predicts TiFe2O4 to be a ferromagnetic
half-metal.89

The most stable configuration
of VFe2O4 is
D-fi2 with trivalent vanadium ions. As can be seen in the Supporting Information, almost all of the investigated
cation and spin distributions display conducting behavior. This is
also the case for the most stable configuration listed in Table 4.

CrFe2O4 is most stable with FeII in tetrahedral
positions and CrIII occupying octahedral
sites. Three different ferrimagnetic configurations were found to
be the most stable. For the configurations D-fi1 and D-fi2, a band
gap of ∼2.3 eV was calculated, while the third configuration
D-fi3 has a metallic ground state.

Projected Density of States
To investigate the influence
of cation distribution and spin state on the nature of excitation,
the projected density of states (PDOS) was calculated for all of the
configurations listed in Tables 3 and 4. In this section, the
PDOS for ZnFe2O4 are displayed exemplarily,
and PDOS for all of the other configurations listed in Tables 3 and 4 can be found in the Supporting Information, Figures S1–S25.

Figure 1 shows the PDOS for ZnFe2O4 A-fm.
The band gap in the minority channel is an oxygen-to-iron transition.
As can be seen from the figure as well as from Table S2 in the Supporting Information, the band gap energy in
the majority channel is higher than in the minority channel. Furthermore,
because all of the iron states near to the valence band maximum (VBM)
are occupied by up-spin electrons, there are no iron states hybridizing
into the VBM in the minority channel. On the other hand, these unoccupied
down-spin states are lower in energy than unoccupied iron states from
the majority channel and hence dominate the conduction band minimum
(CBM). The asymmetry of spin up and spin down channel can also be
seen in the spin densities on the oxygen atoms of ∼0.3μB, which is still small compared to the magnetic moment of
iron, ∼4.3μB. The pronounced difference between
majority and minority channel will have an impact on the optical properties
of this configuration.

Figure 1 PDOS for ZnFe2O4 A-fm.

Figure 2 shows the
PDOS for ZnFe2O4 A-afm1. Again, the VBM is dominated
by O 2p states and the CBM by Fe 3d states. The Zn 3d states seem
to have an insignificant influence on the VBM and CBM.

Figure 2 PDOS for ZnFe2O4 A-afm1.

The PDOS for ZnFe2O4 B-fi4 is shown
in Figure 3. Here,
the channels
are no longer symmetric because the iron atoms carrying up-spin electrons
are located in tetrahedral positions, while those with down-spin electrons
occupy octahedral sites. Again, the figure shows an oxygen-to-iron
VBM–CBM transition in both channels.

Figure 3 PDOS for ZnFe2O4 B-fi4.

The composition of the VBM and CBM of the configurations
listed
in Tables 3 and 4 can be seen in Table 5. The VBM of those spinels where M is a d0 or d10 element, which are ZnFe2O4 and MgFe2O4, is dominated by oxygen
states, independent of the configuration. The same can be seen for
NiFe2O4 B-fi4. Those spinels where M is a d5 to d9 element mostly exhibit a VBM consisting
of hybridized O 2p and M 3d states. Exceptions are, as already mentioned,
NiFe2O4 B-fi4, but also Fe3O4 B-fi4, which exhibits a VBM dominated by Fe 3d states, and
CoFe2O4 B-fi1, whose VBM is dominated solely
by M 3d states. The spinels with M = Sc, Ti, Cr show a VBM dominated
by Fe 3d states. When the transition metals M and Fe contribute significantly
to the VBM, the excitation might be a d-d transition.

The CBM of the majority of configurations listed in Tables 3 and 4 is dominated by Fe 3d states. Exceptions are CuFe2O4 B-fi1 and B-fi3, whose CBM consists of hybridized states
of all elements, as well as Fe3O4 B-fi4 and
TiFe2O4 F-afm1, whose CBM consists of hybridized
Fe 3d and M 3d states.

Conclusions
In this study, electronic
properties of transition-metal oxides
depending on cation and spin distribution were investigated using
a dielectric-dependent self-consistent hybrid density approach. The
calculated optical dielectric constants and fundamental band gaps
show a strong dependency on the cation and spin distribution. Not
only the band gap energy, but also the nature of the lowest-energy
excitation is affected. This result is a possible explanation for
the great variability in experimental results where the materials
might have different degrees of inversion and magnetic states because
of different preparation routes. If it were possible to control cation
and spin distribution, this would be an additional way to tune the
materials.

Computational Details
The calculations were carried
out with the CRYSTAL1790 program package
version 1.0.2. While keeping
the cubic symmetry, full structural relaxations were carried out using
the PW1PW91 functional, ECP basis sets
based on those by Heifets et al.92 for
O, by Heyd et al.93 for Mg, and by Dolg
et al.94 for Sc–Zn (see the Supporting Information). ddsch calculations based
on the GGA-functional PWGGA95 were carried
out with the optimized geometries and the ECP basis sets, and with
the triple-ζ basis sets rev2-pob-TZVP.96 A Monkhorst–Pack grid of 8 × 8 × 8 was sufficient
for most of the calculations, yet for conducting states, a denser
Gilat net of 16 × 16 × 16 was necessary to reach SCF convergence.
Different spin states were generated by setting initial atomic magnetic
moments (ATOMSPIN) and fixing the total magnetic moment during the
calculation (SPINLOC2/BETALOCK). The truncation criteria for bielectronic
integrals (TOLINTEG) were set to 10–7 for the overlap
and penetration threshold for Coulomb integrals and for the overlap
threshold for HF exchange integrals. For the pseudo overlap in the
HF exchange series, the truncation criteria were set to 10–14 and 10–42. The SCF accuracy was set to 10–7 a.u. for geometry optimizations and to 10–6 a.u. for ddsch and single-point calculations, which are the default
accuracies in CRYSTAL17.
