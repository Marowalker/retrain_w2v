The binding properties
of HL1, HL2, and HL3 ligands toward Cu(II)
and Zn(II) ions, constituted by tetraaza-macrocyclic rings decorated
with pyrimidine pendants, were investigated by means of potentiometric
and UV spectrophotometric measurements in aqueous solution, with the
objective of using the related HL-M(II) (HL = HL1–HL3; M =
Cu, Zn) complexes for the preparation of hybrid MWCNT-HL-M(II) materials
based on multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), through an environmentally
friendly noncovalent procedure. As shown by the crystal structure
of [Cu(HL1)](ClO4)2, metal coordination takes
place in the macrocyclic ring, whereas the pyrimidine residue remains
available for attachment onto the surface of the MWCNTs via π–π
stacking interactions. On the basis of equilibrium data showing the
formation of highly stable Cu(II) complexes, the MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II)
material was prepared and characterized. This compound proved very
stable toward lixiviation processes (release of HL1 and/or Cu(II));
thus, it was used for the preparation of its reduced MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0)
derivatives. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transmission electron
microscopy images showed that MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0) contains Cu(0) nanoparticles,
of very small (less than 5 nm) and regular size, uniformly distributed
over the surface of the MWCNTs. Also, the MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0) material
proved very resistant to detachment of its components. Accordingly,
both MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) and MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0) are promising candidates
for applications in heterogeneous catalysis.

Introduction
In a recent work, we
performed the synthesis of HL1 and HL2 ligands
obtained via functionalization of the tetraaza-macrocyclic molecules 1 and 2 with a 6-amino-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-5-nitroso-4-oxopyrimidine
group (Figure 1).1 Thanks to the ability of such pyrimidine residues
to form strong π–π stacking interactions with arene
centers,2 HL1 and HL2 were irreversibly
absorbed onto the surface of multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs)
and the resulting hybrid materials (MWCNT-HL1, MWCNT-HL2) were further
decorated with Pd(II) ions coordinated to the macrocyclic rings. The
final products (MWCNT-HL1-Pd, MWCNT-HL2-Pd) were assayed as heterogeneous
catalysts for the Cu-free Sonogashira coupling reaction, in which
respect they revealed high efficiency, ranking among the best Pd(II)-based
heterogeneous catalysts in terms of yields and reaction times, and
an unprecedented ability to work under environmentally friendly conditions,
such as in water at 50 °C and in an aerobic atmosphere.1 Macrocyclic ligands were chosen to retain Pd(II)
on the surface of MWCNTs because they form complexes with high thermodynamic
stability and high kinetic inertness toward demetallation processes,
characteristics that contribute to the robustness of the catalysts
and favor their reusability.

molecules 1, 2,
and 3.

In addition to their efficiency
as active centers in many catalytic
processes, metal ions fixed into the frames of macrocyclic ligands
have proven useful for a variety of applications, including the construction
of large self-assembled structures, molecular sensors, switches, motors,
and machines; for mimicking biological processes; and for tissue and
organ imaging, among others.3 For this
reason, and in consideration of the successful results given by the
Pd(II)-based heterogeneous catalysts with HL1 and HL2, we decided
to assay the binding ability of HL1 and HL2 toward other metal ions,
and Zn(II) and Cu(II) were chosen, in view of their possible applications
and on account of their implication as catalysts in a variety of reactions.4−6 In this respect, the ability of a hybrid material of the MWCNT-HL1
type to adsorb Cu(II) and Zn(II) metal ions from aqueous solution
was also tested. For the same purpose,
we synthesized the analogous ligand HL3 (Figure 1), containing cyclam (1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclote-tradecane),
the most typical tetraaza-macrocyclic molecule, and extended to this
new ligand the coordination study with Zn(II) and Cu(II). Among tetraaza-macrocycles,
cyclam is the one able to form metal complexes with utmost stability
with many metal ions.7 A potential catalyst
based on Cu(0)-supported nanoparticles was generated from MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II).

polymer, {[CuHL1]2+}n, built
up by repeats of complex units. A segment of the 1D polymer is shown
in Figure 2, evidencing
the metal coordination sphere (selected bond angles and distances
are listed in Table 1).

a Symmetry relation

atoms: 1 – x, y –
0.5, 1.5 – z; e.s.d. in parentheses.

The copper atom is hexacoordinated
by the four nitrogen atoms of
the macrocycle and by the carbonyl oxygen and nitroso nitrogen belonging
to the nitroso-amino pyrimidine group of a contiguous, symmetry-related
ligand. The coordination sphere can be best described as a strongly
distorted octahedron, whose axial distances, defined by the nitroso
oxygen (O1) and the macrocyclic tertiary nitrogen (N1), are strongly
elongated (Table 1).
The equatorial plane is defined by the pyridine and the two secondary
nitrogen atoms of the macrocycle, together with the nitroso nitrogen
from the pyrimidine ring of the contiguous symmetry-related ligand. It is to be underlined that although the coordination of the nitroso
nitrogen clearly acts on the electron distribution in the pyrimidine
ring system, giving a remarkable shortening of the N=O bond
and a lengthening of the N–C bond, the coordination of the
carbonyl oxygen does not determine the weakening of the C=O
bond, which is even shorter than the corresponding mean bond length
of free C=O (1.205(7) Å vs 1.22(2) Å for C=O
and 1.26(3) Å for C=O–M bonds). The head-to-tail
disposition of the ligands in the chain is due to the 21 screw axes, running parallel to the b axis and
determining an overall helical fashion for the coordination polymer.

Similarly to the crystal structures previously reported for metal
complexes obtained with the 3,6,9-triaza-1-(2,6)-pyridinecyclodecaphane
macrocycle functionalized on its 6 position,8 the macrocycle adopts a bent conformation, which leaves the metal
coordination sphere unsaturated. In these structures, however, the
macrocycle and the pendant arm containing donor atoms are involved
in the coordination of the same metal center and isolated complexes
are invariably formed. Instead, in the {[CuHL1]2+}n polymer, the pendant arm and the macrocycle
do not coordinate with the same metal ion so that the pyrimidine ring
protrudes outside, and the metal coordination positions not saturated
by the macrocycle are occupied by exogenous species.

Electroneutrality
is achieved by the presence of two perchlorate
anions in the asymmetric unit. One of them strongly interacts with
the nitroso pyrimidine group via anion−π interactions
with three out of four oxygen atoms (Table S1). Remarkably, one of the strongest anion−π interactions
ever observed was reported for a ligand (L) containing this nitroso-amino
pyrimidine group functionalized with a tren (tris(2-aminoethyl)amine)
moiety. In the crystal structure of the {H4L[Co(CN)6]}·2H2O compound, the nitrogen atom of a cyanide
ion of [Co(CN)6]3– was found 2.786 Å
apart from the ring centroid.9 In this
structure, as well as in those obtained for the same ligand with HgCl42–, HgBr42–, and CdI42–, the anions are pretty
well localized above the ring centroid,9 whereas in [Cu(HL1)](ClO4)2, the ClO4–-pyrimidine interaction appears dominated by the
contact of one perchlorate oxygen with the carbonyl C atom of the
pyrimidine ring. The O11···C17 contact distance (2.872(8)
Å) is almost coincident with the O···ring plane
distance (2.882 Å). The O13 and O14 oxygen atoms are 3.238 and
3.813 Å apart from the ring centroid and can be considered localized
on the ring periphery, having offsets of 0.81 and 2.13 Å, respectively.

Acid–Base Properties of HL3
Potentiometric (pH-metric)
titrations performed in aqueous solution (0.1 M Me4NCl,
298.1 K) in the pH range of 2.5–11.5 showed that HL3 contains
four groups undergoing protonation and an acidic group that starts
being deprotonated above pH 10. Table 2 lists the equilibrium constants determined for these
processes in the form of protonation constants.

For the sake of comparison, the table includes the
protonation
constants previously determined for HL1 and HL2. A distribution diagram
of the protonated species formed as a function of pH is reported in Figure S1. The protonation behavior of HL3 is
consistent with that of HL1 and HL2, in particular with that of HL1,
which is structurally more similar to HL3 (Figure 1). Accordingly, the protonation stage occurring
at the highest pH (log K = 11.22, Table 2) can be ascribed
to the nitrogen atom of the chain directly connected to the pyrimidine
ring, which is expected to be deprotonated at a high pH, whereas protonation
occurring at the lowest pH (log K = 1.99, Table 2) involves the pyrimidine
nitroso group. This behavior is confirmed by the pH dependence of
the absorption spectra of HL3. Indeed, the near-UV spectra of HL3
are characterized by three bands centered at about 328, 276, and 230
nm (Figure 3) corresponding
to allowed π–π* transitions between the π-orbitals
of the pyrimidinic group and overlapping with the band at about 265
nm of the pyridinic one. The spectra show a significant pH dependence
in acidic and alkaline solutions when protonation involves the pyrimidine
chromophore, whereas they are almost invariant in the pH region 4.6–10
when protonation takes place on the nonchromogenic aliphatic amine
groups. Very similar spectral features were found for HL1 and HL2.1

solution:
(a) pH 0.5–8.5, (b) pH 8.5–12.2, and (c) pH dependence
of the 330 nm (red diamonds) and 265 nm (green dots) absorbances.

The highly protonated H5L34+ species is formed
only in small amounts in the lower-pH region we have investigated
(Figure S1). Nevertheless, the detection
of this species is an important result revealing that, as previously
observed for HL1 and HL2 as well as for HL3, three out of the four
nitrogen atoms of the macrocyclic ring can undergo protonation in
the studied pH range.

Formation of Metal Complexes in Solution
The equilibrium
constants for the formation of Zn(II) and Cu(II) complexes with HL1,
HL2, and HL3, determined in aqueous solution (0.1 M Me4NCl, 298.1 K) by means of potentiometric (pH-metric) titrations,
are listed in Table 3. In the case of the Cu(II) complexes with HL3, because of the slowness
of both complexation and dissociation reactions, we were able to study
the system in a restricted pH range (2.5–8) and after special
manipulation of the samples (see Experimental Section). For this reason, larger errors were obtained for the determined
stability constants. Distribution diagrams for the formation of these
complexes are presented in Figure S2. In
terms of the species formed, the three ligands (HL = HL1, HL2, HL3)
give rise to identical complex systems with Zn(II), constituted by
ZnL+, ZnHL2+, ZnH2L3+,
and ZnLOH species, whereas in the case of Cu(II), there are some differences.
In particular, HL1 forms CuL1+, CuHL12+, CuH4L15+, and CuL1OH, whereas HL2 forms CuL2+, CuHL22+, CuH2L23+, and CuH5L26+. HL3 forms the same species of HL1 with the
exclusion of the tetraprotonated one. Such differences are justified
by the different numbers of donor atoms in the ligands and, in the
case of Cu(II), by the greater stability of the complexes with HL3.
Indeed, HL1 and HL3, which can provide at most five donor atoms, are
not able to fulfill the coordination sphere of the metal ions, and
deprotonation of a coordinated water molecule gives rise to MLOH complexes
in alkaline media. On the other hand, HL2, containing one more donor
atom, does not form a similar hydroxylate species with Cu(II), whereas
the corresponding Zn(II) species is significantly less stable than
the hydroxylated complexes formed by HL1 and HL3 (Table 3). The most peculiar feature
of these complex systems, however, is the gap of protonation states
observed for the Cu(II) systems between CuHL12+ and CuH4L15+, in the case of HL1, and between CuH2L23+ and CuH5L26+, for HL2 (Table 3, Figure S2). In CuH4L15+ and CuH5L26+, the metal ion is expected to be bound by
the pyrimidine group in a chelating mode similar to that observed
in the crystal structure of [Cu(HL1)](ClO4)2, while the macrocyclic ring, being triprotonated, is not able to
bind metal ions. As a matter of fact, these highly protonated complexes
are formed in very acidic solutions. When the pH is increased and
the macrocycle starts releasing the most acidic proton, Cu(II) migrates
from the pyrimidine binding site to the macrocycle, forcing the deprotonation
of the remaining ammonium groups. Most likely, such a triple deprotonation
process does not occur in a single step but takes place through successive
equilibria occurring in a pH range so tight that they are not distinguishable,
at least by means of the potentiometric method. This is a case of
pH-controlled metal translocation similar to that observed with macrocyclic
ligands containing divergent binding sites.10

The UV spectra of the ligands in the presence of metal
ions, recorded
at various pH values, are shown in Figure 4 for HL2 with Zn(II) and in Figures S3–S5 for the other systems. A comparison of
complex spectra with those of the metal-free ligands shows that the
330 nm absorbance is insensitive to the presence of metal ions, whereas
the band at 265 nm, due to the pyridine moiety, is enhanced within
the entire pH region in which metal complexation takes place, indicating
that the pyridine nitrogen atom is involved in the formation of all
complex species (Figures 5 and S6). In the case of Cu(II)
complexes (Figures 5b and S6b), however, this enhancement
is present even in very acidic solutions because, under such conditions,
the formation of CuH4L15+ and CuH5L26+, in which the metal ion is coordinated to the pyrimidine
residue, enhances the absorbance due to this chromophoric group also
occurring at about 260 nm. The profile of the pH dependence of this
band is indicative of metal translocation occurring from pyrimidine
to the macrocyclic (pyridine) sites with increasing pH.

systems are reported in Figures S3 and S4.

distribution diagrams. [M2+] = [L] = 5 × 10–5 M. Species charges have been omitted for simplicity.

As already noted above, for HL3, we did not observe
the formation
of Cu(II) complexes in a high protonation state, such as CuH4L15+ for HL1, in which the metal ion is chelated by the
pyrimidine group. Because of the greater stability of the complexes
formed by HL3, a release of the Cu(II) ion from the macrocyclic ring
takes place in more acidic solutions (below pH 3), relative to HL1.
Accordingly, the hypothetical CuH4L35+ species,
is not expected to form in appreciable amounts above pH 2.5, which
is the lower pH limit useful for our pH-metric titrations. Nevertheless,
we cannot exclude the formation of such species below pH 2.5, although
under similar acidic conditions, protonation of the nitroso group
becomes an additional impediment.

HL2 binds the two metal ions
forming more stable complexes than
HL1 and HL3 (Table 3), in agreement with the presence of one more amine group in its
lateral chain. In the case of HL1, it is possible to perform a comparison
with the coordination properties of the parent ligand 1,8c,11 evidencing that the stability of the ZnHL12+ (log K = 12.6) and CuHL12+ (log K = 15.48) complexes is significantly
lower than that of the analogous complexes Zn12+ (log K = 17.42)11 and Cu12+ (log K = 20.43, ref (8c)), in agreement with the loss of coordinating ability experienced
by the primary nitrogen of 1 (Figure 1) upon functionalization with the pyrimidine
residue. As a matter of fact, in the crystal structure of CuHL1(ClO4)2, this amine group is not involved in the coordination
to the metal ion, which completes its coordination environment by
chelate binding of the pyrimidine residue of an adjacent complex molecule.
Nonetheless, when this functionalized nitrogen undergoes deprotonation,
enhancing its coordinating ability, the complex stability increases
(Table 3). This phenomenon
is much less evident for HL2, as the additional amine group in the
lateral chain is already coordinated when the nitrogen atom directly
bound to the pyrimidine group becomes deprotonated. The involvement
of this deprotonated amine group in metal coordination can be assessed
by comparing the equilibrium constants for the protonation of free
and complexed ligands according to the general equilibria L– + H+ = HL and ML+ + H+ = MHL2+ (L = L1, L2, L3; M = Zn, Cu). In the case of HL2, complex
protonation constants (log K = 10.42 for ZnL2+, log K = 10.5 for CuL2+, Table 3) are very
similar to the protonation constant of L2– (log K = 11.25, Table 2), indicating that the group being protonated is free, whereas
in the case of HL1, a similar comparison shows that complex protonation
takes place on a coordinated group (log K =
7.4 for ZnL1+, log K = 4.02 for
CuL1+, log K = 5.3 for ZnL3+, log K = 3.9 for CuL3+ vs log K = 11.13 for L1– and log K = 11.22 for L3–).

Adsorption of Cu(II) and Zn(II) by MWCNT-HL1
To explore
the ability of MWCNTs functionalized with these macrocyclic ligands
to adsorb metal ions other than the already studied Pd(II), which
forms very stable and inert complexes, we checked the MWCNT-HL1/Cu(II)
and MWCNT-HL1/Zn(II) systems. According to a reported procedure,1 hybrid MWCNT-HL1 material, containing 0.36 mmol
of HL1 per gram of MWCNT, was prepared by shaking at 298 K a suspension
of MWCNT (0.5 g) in an aqueous 10–3 M HL1 solution
(500 cm3) at pH 7.5 for 3 days to reach the maximum load
of HL1. The MWCNT-HL1 material, resulting after filtration of the
equilibrated suspension, water washing, and drying, was employed for
the Cu(II) and Zn(II) adsorption tests.

The adsorption isotherms
of Cu(II) and Zn(II) ions on MWCNTs and MWCNT-HL1 adsorbents, obtained
in water at 298.1 K and pH = 5.0, are shown in Figure 6. The analysis of the equilibrium solutions
allowed us to check that HL1 was not desorbed in the experiments involving
MWCNT-HL1. All of the adsorption isotherms were fit to the linear
form of the Langmuir eq 1 (except that of the MWCNT/Zn(II) system, see below), where Ce is the adsorbate equilibrium concentration, X is the amount adsorbed, Xm is the maximum adsorption capacity, and KL is the Langmuir constant. 1  As shown in Figure 6, at pH = 5.0, the pristine MWCNTs bind Cu(II)
to a significant extent, with a maximum adsorption capacity, calculated
from the above equation, Xm = 0.13(1)
mmol/g of adsorbent. In contrast, in the case of Zn(II), the adsorption
is insignificant. The results can be explained by considering that
the adsorption of a metal ion from aqueous solution onto a graphene
surface takes place by interactions of the Cπ(a soft base)–dπ
type,12 which is expected to be stronger
for the acidic Cu(II) than for Zn(II).

Figure 6 Adsorption isotherms
of Cu(II) and Zn(II) on MWCNT and MWCNT-HL1
adsorbents at pH 5.0.

The Cu(II) and Zn(II) loads increase significantly upon functionalization
of the MWCNTs with HL1. In the case of Cu(II), the Xm value increases up to 0.24(1) mmol/g, relative to MWCNT-HL1,
whereas in the case of Zn(II), it also increases significantly from
ca. 0 to 0.080(4) mmol/g (Figure 6). In a previous work,1 the
characterization of MWCNT-HL1 showed that π–π stacking
interaction of the pyrimidine moiety of the adsorbed HL1 with the
Cπ centers of MWCNT results in the loss of (Brönsted)
basicity by the pyrimidine conjugate C(5)-NO group, whereas the basicity
of the polyamine function is preserved to a good extent, allowing
the adsorption, via complexation, of Pd(II) ions by MWCNT-HL1.1 Accordingly, also the adsorptivity enhancement
observed for MWCNT-HL1 with Cu(II) and Zn(II), relative to pristine
MWCNT, is expected to occur via metal coordination to the macrocyclic
moiety of HL1. Indeed, like in the case of Pd(II), upon adsorption
of Cu(II) by MWCNT-HL1, the aliphatic component of the X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) N1s signal corresponding to the polyamine moiety
(Figure 7) shifts to
higher binding energy (BE) values, compared to those of the metal-free
MWCNT-HL1, in agreement with the high strength of the Cu(II)–polyamine
interaction (Table 3). On the contrary, in the case of MWCNT-HL1-Zn(II), the N1s component
of the XPS spectrum shifts to lower BE values. The latter effect,
which is the opposite to that observed with Cu(II) and Pd(II),1 can be ascribed to the fact that the binding
of Zn(II) to HL1 polyamine nitrogen atoms in MWCNT-HL1-Zn is weaker
than the binding of protons by MWCNT-HL1 at the working pH (5). In
fact, the equilibrium data for the HL1-Zn(II) system (Table 3 and Figure 5) show that, at pH = 5, ligand protonation
competes efficiently with Zn(II) coordination.

of a single peak at 933.6 eV with a satellite at 944.0 eV (corresponding
to the release of Cu2p3/2 electrons) and of another peak
at 953.9 eV (assigned to Cu2p1/2 electrons), typical of
Cu(II),13 discards any metal reduction
during the adsorption process and suggests that all copper is adsorbed
as Cu(II) coordinated to the polyamine (Supporting Information). In the case of MWCNT-HL1-Zn(II), the presence
of Zn(II) is confirmed by a well-defined XPS signal at 1020.1 eV corresponding
to the release of Zn2p3/2 electrons (Supporting Information).

According to the
equilibrium data (Table 3) for the formation of HL1 complexes with
Cu(II), the ligand environment of the coordinated Cu(II) in MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II)
should be formed by four polyamine nitrogen atoms, which leave space
for the additional coordination of water molecules or/and hydroxyl
groups. The presence of hydroxyl ligands coordinated to Cu(II) in
MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) is suggested by the quantitative analysis of its
XPS spectrum, which provides an atomic relationship, Cu/Cl ≈
2/1. As charge neutrality requires two negative charges for each Cu(II)
in the sample, it seems likely that the missing Cl– ions were replaced by OH– groups upon the repeated
washing of MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) performed in the final stage of its preparation
(see Experimental Section). A similar conclusion
is reached in the case of MWCNT-HL1-Zn(II), for which the Zn/Cl atomic
relationship obtained from its XPS spectrum is also ≈2/1. Thus,
Zn(II) adsorbed in this material should be complexed by the ligand
polyamine moiety (although more weakly coordinated than in the case
of Cu(II)) and by additional water molecules and/or hydroxyl groups.

Metal-ion adsorption by a polyamine-complexation mechanism explains
that the Xm values of MWCNT-HL1 with Zn(II)
and Cu(II) at pH = 5.0 follow the same trend of the corresponding
effective stability constants (Keff)14 at this pH (log Keff = 4.48 for Zn(II) and log Keff = 9.33 for Cu(II)). In the case of other metal ions, such
as Pd(II), which is expected to form more stable complexes with HL11 than Zn(II) and Cu(II), the adsorption capacity
of MWCNT-HL1 is also much higher.1

In previous works,1,15 we studied the behavior of Pd
catalysts based on Pd(0) nanoparticles and Pd(II) supported on: (i)
an activated carbon functionalized with a tren-derivative ligand and
(ii) the MWCNT-HL1 and MWCNT-HL2 materials used in this work. In these
studies, it was found that the catalytic efficiency and the robustness
of the catalysts increase with the binding ability of surface functions.1,15 On this background and on account of the implication of Cu-based
nanoparticles as catalysts in a wide range of reactions,4 we found it interesting to test the possibility
of obtaining functionalized MWCNTs with surface-stabilized Cu(0) nanoparticles
using our hybrid materials. To this purpose, a MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) sample
was treated with NaBH4 by following the procedure described
in Experimental Section. The XPS of this sample
showed the lack of Cu(II) peaks and the appearance of two peaks at
951.0 and 930.1 eV corresponding to Cu(0)2p1/2 and Cu(0)2p3/2,13 indicating a quantitative
reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(0) (Supporting Information). This reduction is also accompanied by a loss of oxygen from 2.75
to 2.15 atom %, which can be ascribed to the removal of water and
hydroxyl ligands. It is very significant that the nitrogen content
after reduction remains unchanged (3.09 and 3.04 atom % for unreduced
and reduced MWCNT-HL1-Cu, respectively) as also occurs for the Cu
one (0.35 and 0.34 atom % for unreduced and reduced MWCNT-HL1-Cu,
respectively). This shows that, despite the relatively drastic conditions
used for the reduction, neither HL1 nor Cu lixiviate during sample
reduction and successive repeated washing, pointing out a significant
stability of the material. This is not surprising, according to the
proven stability of the π–π interactions in similar
systems.2 Concerning the Cu(0) nanoparticles,
their interactions with the MWCNT surface, illustrated by the transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 8, are reinforced by interaction with the
polyamine residue of HL1 molecules protruding from the surface. As
a matter of fact, shifting of the XPS N1s signal to a significantly
lower BE, relative to MWCNT-HL1, suggests that the unprotonated polyamine
residues of MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0) interact with the surface Cu(0) nanoparticles.15 It is noteworthy that the result obtained by
XPS analysis for the Cu(0) content of the reduced sample is equal
to the Cu(II) content of the parent MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II), meaning that
such Cu(0) nanoparticles should be very small. Actually, because of
the low penetrating power of the radiation used in the XPS analysis,
an accurate quantitative determination of metal from nanoparticles,
by this technique, is only possible for very small nanoparticles (the
bigger the nanoparticle, the lower the amount of metal detected compared
to the real one). Indeed, the detected nanoparticles are smaller than
5 nm. This is illustrated in Figure 8, which also shows the uniformity of their size and
distribution on the external surface of the MWCNTs.

The whole results obtained in
this section show that the structural
characteristics and the stability of both MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) and MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0)
make them promising Cu-based materials to be assayed as potentially
active and robust solid catalysts.

Conclusions
In
summary, the results of this work show that metal-ion adsorption
by materials of the MWCNT-HL1 type represents a suitable procedure
for the preparation of heterogeneous catalysts based on HL1–metal
complexes adsorbed on the MWCNT surface. The preparation procedure,
which is characterized by very mild, environmentally friendly conditions,
provides an efficient control for MWCNT surface functionalization,
which is a crucial factor for an efficient transfer of the catalytic
properties of the HL1–metal complex to the MWCNT surface.

The adsorption results show how the reactivity of the polyamine
function of HL1 toward Zn(II) and Cu(II) determines the preferential
adsorption of these ions on MWCNT-HL1 via coordination to HL1. This
determines a higher adsorption capacity for Cu(II) than for Zn(II)
and gives rise to hybrid materials consisting of MWCNTs containing
HL1-Cu(II) and HL1-Zn(II) complexes homogeneously distributed on the
external graphene surface of the MWCNTs. In view of our previous results,
showing high catalytic efficiency of an analogous Pd(II) derivative,
and taking into account the high thermodynamic stability of the Cu(II)
complex, we expect that MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) might behave as a robust
and reusable catalyst for reactions in which Cu(II)-based catalysts
have proven their efficiency.4 Moreover,
reduction of MWCNT-HL1-Cu(II) provides a Cu(0)-nanostructured MWCNT
hybrid material, whose structure and stability are very promising
for its application in reactions requiring Cu(0)-based catalysts.
This will be the focus of further research work.

Experimental Section
Materials
Unless otherwise specified, all starting
materials were purchased from commercial sources and used as supplied.
Thin MWCNTs with metal oxide content ≤5% were purchased from
Nanocyl (Ref 3100). HL1 and HL2 were obtained according to a previously
reported synthetic procedure.1 The MWCNT-HL1
hybrid material was prepared as previously reported.1

Synthesis of HL3
HL3 was prepared
by the reaction of
1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane-1-ethanamine16 (3 in Figure 1) with 6-amino-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2-methoxy-5-nitroso-4-oxopyrimidine
according to the procedure previously described1 for the synthesis of HL1 and HL2. Yield 95%. C18.5H31N9O3.5 (HL3·0.5MeOH·H2O): calcd C 51.02, H 7.18, N 28.94; found C 50.93, H 7.19,
N 28.70. 1H NMR D2O: δ (ppm) 2.62–3.46
(m, 13H), 3.74 (t, 2H), 4.55 (s, 4H), 7.37 (d, 2H), 7.88 (t, 1H).

Synthesis of [Cu(HL1)](ClO4)2
Crystals
of the complex suitable for X-ray analysis were obtained
by slow evaporation at room temperature of an ethanolic solution containing
HL1 and Cu(ClO4)2·6H2O in equimolar
amounts. Caution! Perchlorate salts of metal complexes
are potentially explosive. Only a small amount of material should
be prepared and handled with care.

Potentiometric Measurements
Potentiometric (pH-metric)
titrations, used to determine ligand protonation and complex stability
constants, were performed in 0.1 M NMe4Cl at 298.1 ±
0.1 K using an automated apparatus and a procedure previously described.17 The combined Metrohm 6.0262.100 electrode was
calibrated as a hydrogen-ion concentration probe by titrating previously
standardized amounts of HCl with CO2-free NaOH solutions
and determining the equivalent point by Gran’s method,18 which gives the standard potential, E°, and the ionic product of water (pKw = 13.83(1) in 0.1 M NMe4Cl at 298.1 K). Computer
program HYPERQUAD19 was used to calculate
ligand protonation and complex stability constants from potentiometric
data. The concentration of the ligands was about 1 × 10–3 M, whereas the concentration of metal ions (M) was [M] ≈
0.8[L]. The studied pH range was 2.5–11.5, unless otherwise
noted. Both complex formation and dissociation reactions of HL3 with
Zn(II) and Cu(II), occurring during the potentiometric titrations,
appeared to be very slow, although the dissociation processes were
much faster than the formation ones. For this reason, these systems
were studied following complex dissociation, that is, by performing
the potentiometric titrations from alkaline to acidic conditions.
In the case of Zn(II), the alkaline solution of the complex was prepared
in the potentiometric cell and the pH variation was monitored until
equilibrium was reached (2 h). Then, the solution was titrated with
a standardized HCl solution. A duration of 45 min was necessary to
reach the equilibrium after each addition. In the case of Cu(II),
2 days were necessary to reach the equilibrium of the starting solution.
Accordingly, the alkaline complex solution was prepared in a separate
vessel, stored in an inert atmosphere, left to equilibrate for 2 days
at 298 K, and then transferred into the titration cell. The measurement
was performed as in the case of Zn(II) but with an elapsed time of
2 h between successive titrant (acid) additions. In the case of Cu(II),
the pH range investigated was 2.5–8. At least two measurements
were performed for each system, both for ligand protonation and for
metal-ion-complexation experiments. For all systems, the different
titration curves were treated as separated curves without significant
variations in the values of the calculated stability constants. Finally,
the sets of data were merged and treated simultaneously to give the
final stability constants. Different equilibrium models for the complex
systems were generated by eliminating and introducing different species.
Only those models for which the HYPERQUAD program furnished a variance
of the residuals σ2 ≤ 9 were considered acceptable.
Such a condition was unambiguously met by a single model for each
system.

Spectrophotometric Measurements
Absorption spectra
were recorded at 298 K on a Jasco V-670 spectrophotometer. The concentrations
of both ligand and metal complex solutions were about 5 × 10–5 M. 1H NMR spectra (400 MHz) in D2O solution were recorded at 298 K on a 400 MHz Bruker Avance III
spectrometer.

Crystallography
Crystallographic

ρcalcd = 1.795 g cm–3, μ
(Cu Kα) = 3.938 mm–1, T =
150 K, R1 = 0.0595 (for 2479 reflections with I > 2s(I)), wR2 = 0.1010
(all data), and GOF = 1.025. The crystals gave poor diffraction, so
the resolution was limited to theta max = 62°. Data collection
was carried out using an Oxford Diffraction XcaliburPX instrument
equipped with a copper anode (λ = 1.5418 Å). A summary
of the crystallographic data is reported in Table S2. The integrated intensities were corrected for Lorentz and
polarization effects and absorption correction was applied.20 The structure was solved by direct methods (SIR92).21 Refinement was performed by means of full-matrix
least-squares using SHELXL-2014/7 program.22 All nonhydrogen atoms were anisotropically refined. Hydrogen atoms
were introduced in calculated positions, and their coordinates and
isotropic displacement factors were refined in agreement with the
linked carbon atoms.

Crystallographic data have been deposited
with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Center (CCDC 1553257).

Adsorption Measurements
Adsorption isotherms of Cu(II)
and Zn(II) ions on MWCNTs and MWCNT-HL1 adsorbents were carried out
at 298.1 K, according to the experimental procedure previously reported.23 Under typical conditions, 0.050 g of each adsorbent
were placed in contact with 25 mL of an aqueous solution of the corresponding
metal dichloride at pH 5.0. The samples were shaken in a thermostated
air incubator until equilibrium was reached (5 days). The adsorbate
concentration ranged from 1 × 10–4 to 1.7 ×
10–3 M. The concentration of the ions was determined
by atomic absorption spectrometry using a PerkinElmer Analyst 800
equipment. The analysis of the equilibrium solutions allowed us to
check that HL1 was not desorbed when the MWCNT-HL1 hybrid material
was used as adsorbent.

Preparation of MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0)
A
sample (43.9 mg) of
MWCNT-HL1-Cu (containing 0.157 mmol of Cu(II) per gram of MWCNT-HL1),
which was obtained from the adsorption isotherm experiment (see above),
was mixed with 10 mL of water, and the mixture was added to 22 mg
of NaBH4, (molar Cu(II)/NaBH4 = 1/80). The mixture
was left to react under stirring for 2 h at room temperature. After
this, the resulting solid was separated by filtration, washed repeatedly
with doubly distilled water, and dried in a desiccator under silica
until a constant weight was obtained.

XPS Spectra
The
XPS spectra of solid samples MWCNT-HL1-Cu,
MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0), and MWCNT-HL1-Zn were recorded with a ESCA5701 instrument
(Physical Electronics), using the Mg Kα 300 W, 15 kV radiation
of the twin anode in the constant analyzer energy mode, with pass
energies of 187.85 and 29.35 eV for the survey and high-resolution
spectra, respectively. The pressure of the analysis chamber was maintained
at 10–9 T, and the BE and the Auger kinetic energy
scale were regulated by setting the C1s transition at 284.6 eV. The
accuracy of BE values was 0.2 eV.

TEM Micrographs
TEM images of the MWCNT-HL1-Cu(0) sample
have been obtained with a JEOL Mod. JEM-1010 equipment.
