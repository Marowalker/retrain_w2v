In
the present study, alkaline peptides AAAXCX (X = lysine or arginine
residues) were designed based on the conserved motif of the enzyme
thioredoxin and used for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs)
in the pH range of 2–11. These peptides were compared with
free cysteine, the counterpart acidic peptides AAAECE and γ-ECG
(glutathione), and the neutral peptide AAAACA. The objective was to
investigate the effect of the amino acids neighboring a cysteine residue
on the pH-dependent synthesis of gold nanocrystals. Kohn–Sham
density functional theory (KS-DFT) calculations indicated an increase
in the reducing capacity of AAAKCK favored by the successive deprotonation
of their ionizable groups at increasing pH values. Experimentally,
it was observed that gold speciation and the peptide structure also
have a strong influence on the synthesis and stabilization of GNPs.
AAAKCK produced GNPs at room temperature, in the whole investigated
pH range. By contrast, alkaline pH was the best condition for the
synthesis of GNP assisted by the AAARCR peptide. The acidic peptides
produced GNPs only in the presence of polyethylene glycol, and the
synthesis using AAAECE and γ-ECG also required heating. The
ionization state of AAAKCK had a strong influence on the preferential
growth of the GNPs. Therefore, pH had a remarkable effect on the synthesis,
kinetics, size, shape, and polydispersity of GNPs produced using AAAKCK.
The AAAKCK peptide produced anisotropic decahedral and platelike nanocrystals
at acidic pH values and spherical GNPs at alkaline pH values. Both
alkaline peptides were also efficient capping agents for GNPs, but
they produced a significant difference in the zeta potential, probably
because of different orientations on the gold surface.

==== Body
Introduction
There is a growing
interest in exploiting the ability to synthesize
gold nanoparticles (GNPs) of controlled size and shape mediated by
amino acids and peptides.1−7 For many years, numerous synthetic strategies developed for the
synthesis of GNPs have frequently required the use of harsh reagents
for controlling the particle morphology. The search for eco-friendly
conditions showed that peptides are an interesting alternative for
reducing the environmental impacts during the synthesis of GNPs. Also,
the capping of GNPs provided by peptides assures efficient delivery
and biocompatibility that can contribute to the use of theranostic
properties of these materials.8 Moreover,
the functional groups available in the peptides, such as −SH
and −NH2, allow a fine control of the synthesis
for achieving the desired functionality for the material. Peptides
provide templates that direct the growth and shape of the metal nanoparticles
as well as their capping.4,5 Particularly, the presence
of a cysteine residue in a peptide provides a mild reducing agent
for biomineralization and an efficient anchor for the peptide on the
GNP surface.9 Therefore, a peptide containing
a cysteine residue is a promising compound for the controlled synthesis
and capping of GNPs. The manipulation of the reaction conditions and
a rational choice of the amino acids arrangement (bioinspired sequences)
make feasible the specific directing of the GNP spatial growth assisted
by peptides. Bioinspired peptides have been shown to be useful for
the assembly and synthesis of gold nanostructures.

Hwang and
co-workers developed the strategy of using peptides conjugated
with nonpeptide organic molecules to provide the characteristics of
a programmable self-assembly and inorganic recognition.9 These motifs conduct the one-pot synthesis, arrangements
of regular structure, and the formation of superstructures of high
complexity. The authors demonstrated
that some members of this class of molecules used for the synthesis
and assembly of nanoparticles could be used to prepare 1D nanoparticle
superstructures and GNP superstructures at the scale of 100 nm formed
by the assembly of spherical structures. One particularly useful feature
of this methodology is that small changes in the composition and sequence
of the peptide conjugate can dramatically influence the structure
of the resulting nanoparticle assembly.9 Brown et al. created a genetic system in the bacterium Escherichia coli to produce nonbiological proteins.10 The genetic system allowed the production of
proteins tailored to control the crystal growth. Si and Mandal used
synthetic oligopeptides with a tryptophan residue at the C-terminal
for the synthesis of gold and silver nanoparticles.11 The authors corroborated tryptophan as the reducing agent
for the gold and silver ions by the identification of the corresponding
products of the peptide oxidation: ditryptophan, kynurenine, and some
cross-linked products. These results are consistent with the formation
of free radical intermediates resulting from the oxidation promoted
by the metal ions. Kim et al. showed that TGTSVLIATPYV peptide, named
Midas-2, formed gold nanostructures of diverse shapes (nanoparticles,
nanowires, nanoribbons, kite and tail structures) and sizes (nanometer-thick
platelets) by changing the reaction conditions, including pH and the
concentration of gold salt precursor.7 For
a more extensive understanding of the state of the art of the use
of peptides for the GNP synthesis, we recommend the reviews by Dickerson
et al. and Sarikaya et al.4,5

In the present
study, we designed two peptides inspired on the
conserved motif of a protein involved in cellular redox processes,
thioredoxin (Trx), with the objective to ensure a highly reducing
moiety for gold ions. Thioredoxins are characterized by the presence
of positively charged amino acids flanking the nucleophilic cysteine
(CXXC motif) (Figure 1), which leads to lowering its pKa and
increasing their reactivity.12,13 The peptides were designed
with the AAAXCX sequence, X being lysine residues (K) or arginine
residues (R), and compared it with the counterpart acidic AAAECE peptide
and the biological γ-ECG peptide, which is known as glutathione
(GSH). The neutral peptide AAAACA and free cysteine were also used.
Only the alkaline AAAKCK multifunctional peptide was efficient to
assist and stabilize GNPs at the pH range of 2–11, and the
results will be discussed herein.

Experimental Section
Chemicals
Hydrogen tetrachloroaurate
(III) (HAuCl4·3H2O) and potassium phosphate
monobasic and
dibasic were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. All of the chemicals were
used as received. Finally, pure water (18.2 MU cm; Millipore) was
used for all experiments.

Synthesis of Peptides
An automated
bench-top simultaneous
multiple solid-phase peptide synthesizer (PSSM 8 system from Shimadzu)
was used for the solid-phase synthesis of all peptides by the Fmoc
procedure.14 The final peptides were deprotected
in TFA and purified by semipreparative high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) using an Econosil C-18 column (10 μ, 22.5 × 250
mm2) and a two-solvent system consisting of (A) trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA)/H2O (1:1000) and (B) TFA/acetonitrile (ACN)/H2O (1:900:100). The column was eluted at a flow rate of 5 mL/min
with a 10%–50% gradient of solvent B over 30 min or with a
30%–60% gradient over 45 min. Analytical HPLC was performed
using a binary HPLC system from Shimadzu with an SPD-10AV Shimadzu
UV–vis detector coupled to an Ultrasphere C-18 column (5 μ,
4.6 × 150 mm), which was eluted with solvent systems A1 (H3PO4/H2O, 1:1000) and B1 (ACN/H2O/H3PO4, 900:100:1) at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
and a 10%–80% gradient of B1 over 20 min. The HPLC column elutes
were monitored for their absorbance at 220 nm. The molecular weight
and purity of the synthesized peptides were checked using a MALDI-TOF
mass spectrometry (Bruker Daltons) or electron spray ionization source
LC/MS-2010 (Shimadzu).14

Synthesis of
Gold Nanoparticles
An aqueous solution
of GNPs was prepared by reducing tetrachloroauric acid (HAuCl4) with a peptide sequence. For this, 30 μL of 10 mM
HAuCl4 was added to 270 μL of phosphate buffer solution
(20 mM) and was reduced by 30 μL of each peptide solution (7
mM). To evaluate the effect of pH on the synthesis, the buffer solutions
were adjusted using HCl or 0.1 M NaOH to 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0,
7.0, 8.0, 9.0, 10.0, and 11.0. The system was kept at room temperature
without the influence of stirring. The colloidal gold solution was
subjected to centrifugation, and the conjugate was washed with deionized
water to remove any uncoordinated peptides. The peptide–GNP
systems were collected by centrifugation (5000 rpm, 25 °C, and
7 min) and subsequently washed three times to remove free peptides
or other compounds present in the reaction solution.

Characterization
The formation of GNPs was further
confirmed by UV–vis spectroscopic measurement of the reaction
mixture solution, which was performed on a Thermo Scientific Evolution
Array UV–visible spectrophotometer, employing a 1 cm quartz
cuvette with ultrapure water as the reference. The zeta potential
(ζ) measurements were carried out using a Zetasizer Nano ZS,
Malvern Instruments, at the temperature of 25 °C to investigate
the superficial charge. Fourier transform Raman (FT-Raman) spectroscopic
measurement was carried out to identify the potential functional groups
responsible for the reduction of gold ions and stabilization of the
synthesized GNPs, which was recorded on a FT-Raman MultiRAM spectrometer
(Bruker Optics). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was
conducted using a Jeol JEM-100CX microscope operating at an accelerating
voltage of 80 kV to determine the morphology and dimension of GNPs.
The samples for TEM study were prepared onto a carbon-coated Cu grid,
which was allowed to dry under ambient conditions. To understand the
crystalline characteristics, X-ray powder diffraction data were recorded
at room temperature on an STADI-P powder diffractometer in transmission
geometry by using a Mo Kα1 (λ = 0.7093 Å)
wavelength selected using a curved Ge (111) crystal, with a tube voltage
of 50 kV and a current of 40 mA.

Results and Discussion
The sequence AAAXCX was designed to investigate the effect of cysteine
vicinity on the capacity of these peptides for assisting and stabilizing
GNPs. Literature data show that the alanine residues are not directly
involved in the synthesis of GNPs and play structural and stabilizing
roles in the peptide sequence.15 The cysteine
thiol group of the peptide AAAXCX is expected to have a lowered pKa value when X = K or R that was corroborated
using peptide titration. The AAAKCK peptide exhibited pKa values of 2.2, 7.7, and 9.7. These pKa values can be assigned, respectively, to the terminal
C, the cysteine thiol group, and the amino groups of the peptide (Figure 2). The pKa value of alanine α-amino group is 2.18, and a
different value is unexpected for this group in the peptide structure.16 The pKa value of
9.7 is probably a mean value that resulted from the contribution of
the three amino groups of the peptide, that is, the terminal N and
the lateral chains of the two lysine residues.

Figure 2 Changes in the net charge
of AAAKCK peptide sequence during the
titration using HCl and NaOH. The pKa values
of the ionizable groups are indicated beside the arrows.

The AAAKCK peptide was used as a reducing and stabilizing
agent
for the synthesis of GNP, at room temperature within a pH range of
2–11 with 1 unit of interval among the values. The formation
of the GNPs was formerly evidenced by the color change of the solution
from pale yellow to purple, pink, or red under different reaction
conditions. The presence of GNPs was then corroborated by the appearance
of the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) at the wavelength range of
500–600 nm, which is typical of GNP plasmon absorbance.17Figure 3A–D shows the spectra obtained during the synthesis
of GNPs using the AAAKCK peptide at pH 4, 6, 9, and 11, respectively.
These spectra are representative of the GNP SPR obtained at the acidic
and alkaline pH range. The SPR of GNPs produced using AAAKCK at acidic
pH is featured as narrow bands, peaking at the wavelength range of
530–550 nm. The GNPs obtained at pH 6 also exhibit a broad
band that peaks at 800 nm. This result is consistent with the presence
of anisotropic particles. The SPR bands of GNPs obtained at alkaline
pH are broad bands peaking at the wavelength range of 550–600
nm.

Figure 3 Time-resolved UV–vis spectra obtained during the synthesis
of GNPs using AAAKCK at pH (a) 4.0, (b) 6.0, (c) 9.0, and (d) 11.0.

The kinetic analysis shows that
the GNPs synthesized at the acidic
pH using AAAKCK (Figure 4 square symbols) exhibited SPR bands with the maximal intensity around
0.2. However, an increasing lag time to the maximal intensity occurred
concomitant with the increase in the pH (white, light gray, and gray
symbols for pH 4, 5, and 6, respectively). The maximal intensity of
the GNP SPR bands synthesized at the pH range of 7–11 was around
0.3. In the alkaline medium, an increasing lag time for attaining
the maximal intensity of the SPR band was observed at increasing pH
values.

Figure 4 pH-dependent kinetics of the GNP synthesis using AAAKCK in the
pH range of 4–10 as indicated in the figure.

Figure 5 shows the
pH-dependent intensity of SPR bands at 560 nm after 10 and 40 min
from the starting of the synthesis reactions (blue and red lines and
symbols, respectively). Also, in Figure 5, the black line and symbols show the pH-dependent
time necessary for the maximal intensity of SPR band to be attained
(lag time). The maximal SPR intensity was attained before 10 min of
incubation at acidic and neutral pH values and in all conditions after
40 min of incubation. According to Figure 5, the influence of three ionizable groups
on the synthesis of GNPs using AAAKCK is evident. The turning point
at pH 3.6 reflects, more probably, gold speciation, that is, the hydrolysis
of HAuCl4– (eq 1) rather than the deprotonation of terminal
COOH group (pKa 2.2). 1  According
to Moreau et al.,18 equimolar concentrations
of AuCl4 and the water-coordinated
species AuCl3(OH–) + AuCl3(OH2) are expected at pH 3. The authors stated that 20%
of AuCl3(X) species at pH 3.0 are AuCl3(OH–) and that 30% of AuCl3(X) species are AuCl3(OH2). The pKa value
of gold speciation can suffer a slight deviation influenced by the
presence of peptide and phosphate in the medium. In fact, recently
a significant influence of gold speciation on the synthesis of GNPs
using albumins was reported.19 The pKa value of 6.2 probably reflects the deprotonation
of the lateral chains of the amino acid involved in the reduction
of gold ions. Two groups might be responsible for gold reduction:
the thiol group of cysteine and the amino group of lysines. The value
of 6.2 is significantly lower than the pKa value of these groups in the free amino acids: 8.3 and 10.5, respectively.
However, the protonated amino groups of lysine residues that are neighboring
cysteine could lower the pKa value of
the thiol group. It is also probable that one of the two lysine residues
put each other in proximity also has a lower pKa value of the lateral chain. The titration of the peptide
showed pKa values of 7.7 and 9.7, which
are consistent with −SH and −NH3+ with lowered pKa values. The coordination
of these ionizable groups with gold ions can respond to the more exacerbated
lowering of their pKa values to 6.2 and
9.0. It is important to note that the value of 9.7 obtained from the
peptide titration is an average value of the ε and terminal
α-amino groups. However, the pKa value of around 9.0 obtained from the rate of synthesis refers to
the ionizable alkaline groups that participate in the synthesis and
stabilization processes.

Figure 5 pH-dependent maximal intensity of the SPR at
560 nm after 10 min
(blue line and symbols) and 40 min (red line and symbols). The black
line and symbols indicate the pH-dependent delay time to the maximal
SPR intensity.

The pH of the medium
has a significant influence not only on the
net charge and structure of the peptides but also on the speciation
of aqueous HAuCl4. The speciation of gold influences the
oxidizing capacity of the species. A previous study demonstrated that
the reduction potential of the aqueous HAuCl4 solution
decreased with the increase in pH.20 The
voltammograms of the aqueous HAuCl4 solution measured at
pH 2.91, 6.16, and 8.01 exhibited reduction potentials of 0.66, 0.59,
and 0.53 V, respectively, and no reduction peak at pH 10.35.20 It is important to note that the values of the
reduction potential of gold ion species at different pH values are
not extremely different. Thus, although the reactivity of gold species
decreases with the increasing pH, the combination of fast rate of
synthesis and high intensity of SPR observed at pH 7 cannot be explained
by gold reactivity. Probably, the displacement of water from AuCl3(OH–) is more favorable than that of one
Cl– from AuCl4– for
the coordination with the peptide.

To better understand the
factors influencing the synthesis of GNP
using AAAKCK, ab initio calculations based on total Kohn–Sham
density functional theory (KS-DFT)21,22 with local
density approximation (LDA)23 were performed
to determine the charge reduction of the peptide complexed with AuCl4–. Our results were obtained using the projector
augmented wave (PAW) method,24 with an
energy cutoff of 465.0 eV as implemented in the VASP code.25,26 The relaxation was
allowed until the forces were smaller than 0.02 eV/Å in a 15
× 25 × 25 Å supercell dimension for x, y, and z directions, respectively.
For this calculation, three configurations of the peptide–AuCl4– complex were considered: protonated thiol
(−SH) with a neighboring
positively charged amino group (acidic form), deprotonated thiol (−S–) with a neighboring positively charged amino group
(neutral form), and deprotonated thiol with a neighboring amino group
(basic form). The first configuration was obtained by abstracting
one electron of the peptide–AuCl4–complex, and the last configuration was obtained by abstracting one
proton. The peptide–AuCl4– complex
was studied using Bader analysis, in which the space was divided into
regions limited by surfaces where the gradient of electron density
had no normal component.27 These configurations
allowed the decomposition of the electron density of each atom. Using
the Bader analysis, the total approximated electronic charge was obtained
by the sum of the corresponding points of the grid.28 The sum of the Bader electronic charges for the peptide–AuCl4–complexes was 0.350, 0.391, and 0.479,
for the acidic, neutral, and basic configurations, respectively. These
values corroborated that the deprotonation of the thiol group at pH
values above its pKa value—lowered
by a neighboring positively charged amino group—increases the
reducing capacity of the peptide. However, at highly alkaline pH values,
the deprotonation of the neighboring amino group increased the reducing
capacity of the peptide once again. Solution pH also exhibited a great
influence on the characteristics and particle size distributions of
the GNPs. Figure 6 shows
the representative electronic microscopy images of GNPs obtained under
different conditions, which illustrates the formation of gold nanostructures
with various shapes. The histograms shown in panels D and E shows
the shape distributions of the GNPs synthesized at pH 4.0 and 6.0,
respectively. Panel F shows the size distribution of GNPs synthesized
at pH 9.0. The histograms D and E evidenced the shape polydispersity
of the GNPs synthesized at pH 4.0 and 6.0. GNPs synthesized at pH
4.0 are predominantly icosahedron and decahedron (71.4%). Hexagonal
plates were 6.1%, and other shapes constituted 22.5% of the GNPs synthesized
at pH 4.0. GNPs synthesized at pH 6.0 exhibited a more pronounced
polydispersity of shapes and sizes (Figure 6B); similar morphologies for biosynthetic
GNPs were observed previously.29−32 This result is consistent with the presence of two
SPR bands of GNPs produced at pH 6.0 as shown in Figure 3B. In this condition, that
is, at pH 6.0, icosahedron and decahedron remained as the predominant
shapes (∼68%), the contribution of other irregular shapes decreased
to ∼11%, and the bipyramidal and spherical GNPs—absent
in the sample produced at pH 4.0—constituted ∼13%. Icosahedron,
decahedron, and plates were produced at pH 4.0 and 6.0 but with higher
size polydispersity in the latter pH. The respective size ranges of
the icosahedron, decahedron, and plates produced at pH 4.0 were 55–90,
50–100, and 65–125 nm, respectively. For the synthesis
performed at pH 6.0, the size ranges of the icosahedron, decahedron,
and plates were 15–45, 15–55, and 20–210 nm,
respectively. The polydispersity in shapes and sizes probably results
from twinning, a very common process for face-centered cubic (fcc) metals.33,34 Our analysis suggests that random
twinning is likely a product of fast and nonuniform reduction, predominant
in acid reaction media, as shown in Figure 4. GNPs produced at pH 9.0 (Figure 6C) did not present shape polydispersity,
and the size distribution histogram revealed the predominance of 18
nm GNPs.

plates and a decahedral NP. Panel B shows a zoomed-in view of plates

and SPH = sphere).

The crystalline nature
of GNPs synthesized with the AAAKCK sequence
at pH 4.0 was further corroborated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis.
The X-ray diffraction pattern is shown in Figure 7. The Bragg reflection peaks are corresponding
to (111), (200), (220), (311), and (222) lattice planes. The 2θ
degree values are consistent with the face-centered cubic (fcc) gold crystal structure as determined by the Joint Committee
on Powder Diffraction Standards (JCPDS) file no: 04-0784. The electron
diffraction pattern of gold nanostructures (inset of Figure 7) exhibits the characteristics
of polycrystalline gold.

pH = 4.0 and the
corresponding electron diffraction analysis (inset).

The UV–visible spectra in Figure 3 showed another interesting
characteristic
of the GNP synthesis with the AAAKCK sequence. The spectra obtained
immediately after mixing the reagents (dotted lines) did not present
bands at the UV region. However, at the subsequent times of synthesis,
the appearance of bands was observed in the range of 325–340
nm that are assigned to two unresolved ligands (π) to metal
(σ*) charge transfer (LMCT) bands.18,20Figure 8 shows the
pH profile of the LMCT band. The LMCT bands are assigned to the coordination
of the peptide—probably SH—with the GNP surface that
is consistent with the capping of GNPs by the peptides.

Figure 8 pH-dependent
maximal absorbance of LMCT band resulted from the
capping of GNPs synthesized by the AAAKCK peptide.

The GNPs produced by the AAAKCK peptide were also
characterized
by the zeta potential (Figure 9) and Raman spectroscopy (Figure 10). The results obtained with these techniques
corroborated the capping of GNPs by the peptides. The samples remained
unchanged even after some months at room temperature, indicating that
the synthesized GNPs were very stable, and no aggregation occurred.
It is known that peptides can bind to metal nanoparticles through
free amine group or cysteine side chain and via electrostatic attraction
of negatively charged carboxyl group, forming a coat on the particle
surface to prevent agglomeration and ensuring the stabilization of
GNPs.35−37 The ζ potential values of these GNPs varied
from −7.6 to −24.9 mV. These values are consistent with
a partial covering of gold surface by AAAKCK, considering that the
ζ value of bare GNPs is −38 mV.38 For our samples, the values of zeta potential decreased by increasing
the pH, which is consistent with the deprotonation of the lysine ε-amino
groups of the peptide covering the GNPs and decreasing their tendency
for aggregation (Figure 9). In Figure 9, the
decrease in the ζ potential (−8.6 to −17.4 mV)
observed by changing the pH from 3 to 4 and (−17.4 to −24.9
mV) from pH from 7 to 10 is consistent with the deprotonation of carboxylic
and amino groups at the gold surface, respectively.

Figure 10 FT-Raman spectra of AAAKCK peptide at pH 4.0 (red line) and the
corresponding SERS effect promoted by the association of the peptide
with GNPs. The inset shows the differential Raman spectra obtained
by subtracting the Raman spectra at pH 4.0 from those at pH 9.0.

Raman spectra were recorded out
to identify the possible functional
groups present in the peptide sequence involved in the reduction of
gold ions and the type of interaction in the capping and stabilization
of synthesized nanostructures.39Figure 10 shows the Raman
spectra of AAAKCK solution (red line) and GNPs synthesized and stabilized
by AAAKCK at pH 4.0 (black line). In Figure 10, the more pronounced surface-enhanced Raman
scattering (SERS) effect for some groups is consistent with a predominant
orientation of the peptide on the GNP surface. The SERS effects were
the most intense for bands peaking at 3207, 1640, 1191, 1065, 804,
601 (shoulder), and 428 cm–1. The band at 3207 cm–1 is assigned to NH stretch modes. The band at 1640
cm–1 is amide I band assigned to C=O stretch
of the α-helix structure. In the Raman spectrum of AAAKCK solution,
this band is weak and peaks at 1660 cm–1.40 The SERS effect associated with the shift of
the amide I band to a lower frequency, consistent with the α-helix
structure, corroborated the association of the peptide with the GNP
surface. The bands at 1191 and 804 cm–1 are assigned
to CH2 twist and CH2 rock modes. The spectral
region of 1065–1071 cm–1 involves the respective
contribution of Cα–Cβ stretch
and C–S asymmetric stretch. SERS effect was also observed at
601 cm–1 (shoulder) that could be assigned to the
blue-shifted contribution of δCSS and νCSS modes. The increased signals in the spectral range from
500 to 200 cm–1 result from the overlapped contribution
of CCC and CCS bending vibration (ω), C–S stretching
mode (νCS), and CSH bending mode (βCSH).41,42 The inset of Figure 8 shows the differential Raman spectra obtained
by subtracting the Raman spectra obtained at pH 4.0 from those obtained
at pH 9.0. The more pronounced differences in the differential spectra
were observed at 601 cm–1 (δCSS and νCSS), in the spectral region from 500 to 200
cm–1 (overlapped CCC and CCS ω, νCS, and βCSH), and in the band at 3207 cm–1 (NH stretch modes). Additionally, a band at 3406
cm–1 region appeared in the differential spectrum
(region highlighted in gray). Considering that the spectral region
of 3450–3250 cm–1 contains the contribution
of amide A bands that are assigned to the stretching vibration of
the peptide N–H, the additional red-shifted band could correspond
to another orientation of the peptide on GNP.

For the AAAXCX
structure, the replacement of lysine residues by
arginine residues (AAARCR) changed the properties of the peptide for
GNP synthesis. The GNP synthesis with AAARCR at acidic pH values resulted
in low-intensity plasmon resonance bands at pH 2, 3, 4, and 5. Plasmon
resonance bands were not detected at pH 6, 7, and 8. At acidic pH,
the GNPs presented broad plasmon resonance bands with a high contribution
of turbidity. GNPs synthesized with AAARCR at pH 9 and 10 presented
narrower plasmon resonance bands peaking at 536 nm, consistent with
a low polydispersity and mean diameter of 79 ± 6 nm, as determined
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Figure 11). GNPs synthesized with AAARCR at pH 3,
9, and 10 presented better stability and were more intense and featured
the plasmon resonance band. The zeta potential values determined for
the GNPs synthesized at the pH values cited were +39.7 ± 3; +30.4
± 1.7, and +33.2 ± 1.4 mV, respectively. These values are
consistent with a highly efficient covering in which the guanidine
group of arginine residues is exposed on the GNP surface. Probably
the orientation and packing of the AAARCR peptide on the GNP surface
shielded the carboxylic groups, leading to a positively charged particle.

The present results demonstrated that the reducing capacity
of
AAAXCX is favored by the deprotonation of the ionizable groups, but
the molecular structure of the peptides has a strong influence on
the growth of the GNPs. Therefore, very similar peptide structures
resulted in the different pH-dependent synthesis of GNPs. Considering
that the replacement of lysine by arginine drastically changed the
pH profile of the GNP synthesis, a neutral sequence and two acidic
sequences were also tested and compared with free cysteine: AAAACA,
AAAECE, and GSH (γ-ECG). Under the same conditions as for the
synthesis used for the alkaline peptides, all of these peptides were
unable to assist the GNP synthesis. This result shows that the acidic
peptides with different structures were unfavorable for the synthesis
of GNP. The AAAACA peptide was able to assist the GNP synthesis only
in the presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG10) at pH 8 and 11 (Figure S1B). AAAECE peptide and GSH required
PEG10 and heating at 80 °C to assist GNP synthesis. In these
conditions, AAAECE assisted the GNP synthesis at pH 7 and 11 (Figure S2A) and GSH assisted the GNP synthesis
only at pH 11. AAAECE-assisted and AAAECE-stabilized GNPs were characterized
by electronic absorption spectroscopy and by TEM (Figure S2B). The XRD analysis of GNPs synthesized with AAAECE
at pH 7.0 is shown in Figure S3. The major
diffraction peaks were indexed as the face-centered cubic (fcc) gold
phase based on the data of JCPDS file (JCPDS no. 04-0784). The dependence
of PEG for the GNP synthesis assisted by acidic peptides suggests
that the interaction with gold species is not favorable for these
structures. PEG created a template and a microenvironment that favored
the gold ions–peptide interactions. Differently, cysteine-assisted
GNP synthesis occurred at the same pH range (2–11) that was
effective for AAAKCK (Figure S1A). However,
cysteine, when used as a reducing agent, did not efficiently stabilize
GNPs, and the aggregation was also observed 24 h after the synthesis
(not shown). The peptide structure also influenced the crystal growth
and GNP capping with repercussions for the nanocrystal properties.
The routes of metallic nanoparticle synthesis that provide the control
for nanocrystal size and shape are desired because they dictate the
properties of these materials. Bulk metallic materials exhibit typical
properties such as magnetism and conductivity that are related to
the quasicontinuous density of states.43 At nanoscale level, the continuum of orbital energy is replaced
by a discrete-energy-level structure. At the quantum dot scale, the
material can exhibit well-defined bonding and antibonding molecular
orbitals. Otherwise, anisotropy has dramatic effects on the optical
properties of metal nanoparticles such as increased absorption, fluorescence,
and Rayleigh (Mie) scattering.44 These
effects are extensive to the molecules adsorbed on their surface as
the well-known SERS technique. Therefore, controlling the nanostructure
shape is an efficient and sophisticated strategy for optical tuning.
Anisotropy of metal nanoparticles results from the particle growing
in a preferred direction. Synthesis of anisotropic metal nanoparticles
can be achieved by the use of hard templates or the control of thermodynamic
and kinetic parameters involved in the crystallographic control.45 Under the conditions of the present study, GNPs
were synthesized by the addition of gold salt in the peptide solution.
In the solution-based method, the steps for the synthesis of fcc gold nanocrystal involve the reduction of Au3+ to Au0, nucleation, and growth to form seeds with a diversity
of structures dictated by thermodynamic and kinetic factors.46−48 TEM images of GNPs produced with the AAAKCK peptide at acidic pH
revealed the predominance of the icosahedron and decahedron structures
with the presence of some plates and other irregular nanostructures.
The increase in pH from 4.0 to 6.0 decreased the size range of the
nanostructures. GNPs produced at pH 6.0 exhibited higher shape polydispersity
with the additional contribution of bipyramidal and spherical nanoparticles
as well as complete and incomplete triangular plates. The icosahedra,
decahedra, bipyramids, and plates with different sizes result from
multiple twinned seeds and plates with stacking faults.49 More details on the factors that govern the
growth of seeds toward the diversity of nanostructures can be found
in the refs (50) and (51). The pH of the medium
is described as a key growth parameter in the synthesis of GNPs using
biomolecules. The pH of the medium determines the ionization state
of the biomolecules with repercussions on their reducing capacity
and binding affinity for the gold surface. The effect of pH on the
shape, size, and polydispersity of GNPs produced by the AAAKCK peptide
was similar to the results presented by other studies using the biomolecules
present in plant and microorganism extracts.52,53 The production of larger nanoparticles with a diversity of shapes
at lower pH has been attributed to the weakened repulsion between
the negatively charged AuCl4– ions and the predominantly
protonated carboxylic groups of biomolecules resulting in uncontrolled
nucleation of seeds. Also, at lower pH values, the coagulation (coalescence)
of smaller nuclei is favored, leading to the formation of larger GNPs.54 The size range of
icosahedra, decahedra, and plates produced, respectively, at pH 4.0
was consistently 55–90, 50–100 and 65–125 nm,
whereas the size range of the same nanostructures produced at pH 6.0
decreased to 15–45, 15–55, and 20–210 nm, respectively.
It is worth to remark that spherical GNPs were detected among the
GNPs synthesized at pH 6.0. Higher pH values move the equilibrium
between the ionization states of peptides toward the negatively charged
forms. In this condition, the stronger repulsion between the negatively
charged peptides and gold ions impairs the further growth of nuclei
and favors the formation of small spherical nanoparticles. Under the
conditions of the present study, it was also observed that the particle
size and polydispersity decreased by increasing the pH. The pH also
tailors the shape of GNPs by influencing the differentiated capping
of crystal facets.55−57 It is well known that the capping agents with a specific
affinity to a crystal facet can direct the anisotropic growth.43 An increase in
LMCT band intensity was consistently observed during the synthesis
of GNPs. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the preferential
ligation of the peptide on a facet of the crystal seed contributed
to the formation of the hexagonal and triangular nanoplates observed
for the synthesis performed at acidic pH values.58 Thus, a rationale for the pH-dependent formation of anisotropic
nanocrystals in the synthesis using AAAKCK can be achieved. At acidic
pH values, the equilibrium of the peptide is dislocated to the protonated
thiol group of cysteine. In this condition, lysine could have a significant
contribution as the reducing agent, and the availability of SH groups
provide the capping, directing the anisotropic growth. At increasing
pH values, the dislocation of the equilibrium toward deprotonated
thiol group (−S–) could modify the capping
properties of the peptide. A 10 nm red shift of the LMCT bands at
alkaline pH and a significant loss of intensity of this band at pH
11 were consistently observed. The SERS effect on different vibrations
involving the thiol group corroborated that cysteine lateral chains
interact with the GNP surface. The significant SERS effect on the
vibration of peptide N–H suggests that the polypeptide chain
is also close to the gold surface. The differential Raman spectra
shown in the inset of Figure 5 suggests that N–H groups assume different interactions
with the GNP surface synthesized at alkaline pH. The differentiated
interaction could change the capping, leading to an impairment of
the anisotropic growth. The negative values of the zeta potential
of GNPs synthesized with the AAAKCK peptide and the strong pH-dependent
SERS effect on N–H stretching suggest that the peptide is positioned
horizontally along the peptide backbone on the gold surface. Interestingly,
the LMCT band was not present in the UV spectra of the GNPs synthesized
with the AAARCR peptide. In this condition, the GNPs exhibited positive
values of zeta potential that is consistent with the guanidine group
of arginine lateral chain on the surface of the GNPs. It is unlikely
that the cysteine thiol group of AAARCR is not coordinated with the
gold surface. However, the complete capping of the GNP surface by
the AAARCR peptide could shield the gold-interacting thiol group,
impairing the UV-light access and the occurrence of the ligand–metal
transition. These results suggest that AAARCR binds to the gold surface
by the thiol group and projects its polypeptide chain vertically from
the surface. This positioning of AAARCR allows a better covering of
the particle that filters the incident UV light. Figure 12 summarizes the proposal of
AAAKCK and AAARCR orientation on the gold surface.

Conclusions
In the present study, we exploited the structural
features of two
alkaline bioinspired peptides for the synthesis of GNPs at the pH
range of 2–11 and compared them with acidic peptides and cysteine.
The objective was to investigate whether the lowering of the thiol
group pKa of peptides by positively charged
neighboring amino acid chains favors the GNP synthesis. The striking
differences observed for the GNP synthesis assisted by AAAKCK and
AAARCR, and the inefficiency of the acidic peptides demonstrated that
the synthesis and stabilization of GNPs is a very complex process
in which the ionization of cysteine is one of the participating factors.
A synergistic combination of structure, net charge, reducing capacity,
and accessibility of the thiol group operates in the synthesis of
GNP assisted and stabilized by cysteine-containing peptides. In this
scenario, the sequence array KCK is unique for a pH modulation of
the synthesis of GNP with different sizes and shapes that are key
characteristics for different applications.
