The glassy carbon electrode was fabricated
with multifunctional bis-triazole-appended calix[4]arene and then
used for the simultaneous detection of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and
Hg(II). Before applying the square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry,
the sensitivity and precision of the modified electrode was assured
by optimizing various conditions such as the modifier concentration,
pH of the solution, deposition potential, accumulation time, and supporting
electrolytes. The modified glassy carbon electrode was found to be
responsive up to picomolar limits for the aforementioned heavy metal
ions, which is a concentration limit much lower than the threshold
level permitted by the World Health Organization. Importantly, the
designed sensing platform showed anti-interference ability, good stability,
repeatability, reproducibility, and applicability for the detection
of multiple metal ions. The detection limits obtained for Zn(II),
Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) are 66.3, 14.6, 71.9, and 28.9 pM, respectively.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy
metals (HMs) are highly toxic, nonbiodegradable, persistent, and ubiquitously
distributed, thus posing a great threat to the biosphere. The major
cause of these pollutants is the anthropogenic activities including
mining, smelting, and various other industrial processes. These toxins
enter into the body of living organisms through the food chain and
induce severe health effects.1−4 Some HMs such as iron, cobalt, zinc, copper, and
manganese are important in trace amounts, but their excess leads to
toxic effects in humans.5,6 While other HMs, that
is, lead, arsenic, mercury, cadmium, etc., are considered highly toxic
even at very low concentrations. The toxicity of these HMs is declared
by the “Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry Priority
List of Hazardous Substances” and World Health Organization
(WHO).7−11 The excess of HMs results in enzyme inhibition, oxidative stress,
and impaired antioxidant metabolism. Moreover, these have been reported
to cause lethal effects in living organisms by free-radical generation
and could end up with mutations in DNA,12−17 reduction of protein sulfhydryl, and lipid peroxidation.3,6,18 For instance, the presence of
Pb(II) ions above a certain level of its threshold causes neurodegenerative
diseases, kidney damage, bone growth retardation, hyperirritability,
and ataxia.19 Similarly, the presence of
mercury causes kidney failure, vestibular dysfunction, respiratory
track damage, autism, birth defects, speech impairment, and skin diseases
after exceeding its threshold limit.20 Likewise,
zinc is another heavy metal, and the excess of which leads to cardiac
dysfunction, DNA damage, and gene mutation.21 Moreover, arsenide (As(III)) being the most toxic is associated
with several deadly diseases such as skin lesions, lung cancer, keratosis,
bladder cancer, etc. Therefore, it is important to develop analytical
tools to detect and quantify the HM ions in drinking water reservoirs.

The analytical methods commonly used for HM ion detection are atomic
absorbance spectroscopy, atomic emission spectroscopy, inductively
coupled plasma mass spectroscopy, and X-ray fluorescence. These methods
are of great significance, but their cost, time consumption, and requirement
of large sample volumes and highly skilled operators limit their operations
at small scales. The electrochemical techniques, particularly stripping
voltammetry, on the other hand, are promising alternatives and extensively
used for HM ion detection owing to their simple design, portability,
faster analysis speed, greater sensitivity, and improved selectivity.22−27 Suitable modifiers are used for boosting up the sensitivity of the
working electrode.28−30 Bis-triazole-appended calix[4]arene (BTC) was selected
as an electrode modifier owing to its amphipathic structure. The insolubility
of BTC in aqueous solutions due to the dominance of its hydrophobic
character and presence of hydrophilic groups such as 1,2,3-triazole,
alkoxy, hydroxyl, and aldehyde functional groups suitable for binding
to metal ions makes the selected modifier useful for electrode modification.
It possesses electrode-anchoring hydrophobic groups and metal ion-binding
groups, thus acting as a conducting bridge between the host (transducer)
and guest (target metal ions). Thus, in the present work, the synthesized
BTC modifier was drop-casted on a glassy carbon electrode surface.
The designed electrochemical sensing platform presents a cost-effective
and novel approach for the sensitive and selective determination of
Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) in laboratory samples as well
as in real samples. The proposed method offers a feasible way for
on-site detection of heavy metal cations, particularly, the most lethal,
As(III) and Hg(II) in water.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Bis-triazole-Appended Calix[4]arene (BTC)
The detailed synthesis, characterization, and X-ray diffraction studies
of BTC have already been published by our research group.31 The brief outline for its synthesis is shown
in Scheme 1.

2.2 Electrochemical Characterization of the Bis-triazole-Based Calix[4]arene-Modified
GCE
The changes in the surface properties of the GCE were
analyzed by cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
after modification with BTC. Meanwhile, cyclic voltammetry (CV) was
also carried out using bare and modified GCEs in a solution mixture
of 5 mM potassium ferricyanide (K3[Fe(CN)6])
and 0.1 M KCl. The experimental results displayed a great enhancement
in current values for oxidation and reduction of the potassium ferri/ferrocyanide
redox couple as shown in Figure 1.32−35 The observed enhancement in the current values was attributed to
more active sites and an increased surface area of the modified GCE.
Thus, the assembling of BTC on GCE was confirmed to be used as a modifier
for improved sensing of metal ions.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms of (a) bare and (b)
modified GCEs in a 5 mM solution of K3[Fe(CN)6] containing 0.1 M KCl.

Moreover, EIS studies
were performed under a similar environment as shown in Figure 2. A semicircular arc and a
straight line were obtained in a Nyquist plot. The diameter of the
semicircle in the Nyquist plot that corresponds to charge transfer
resistance (Rct) controls the charge transfer process on the electrode/electrolyte
interface. A significant decrease in the diameter of the semicircular
arc after the modification of the GCE with BTC reveals an increase
in charge transfer kinetics at the modified electrode. The obtained
EIS results are in good agreement with the results of cyclic voltammograms.

impedance spectroscopy.

2.3 Metal
Ion Chelation
After the successful modification of GCE with
BTC, square-wave anodic stripping voltammetry (SWASV) was performed
on the solution mixture containing Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II)
in 50% BRB solution at pH 3 using both bare (control) and modified
GCEs as shown in Figure 3. The BTC-modified GCE displayed a more intense current response
as compared to unmodified GCE. This increase in current signals of
metal ions can be attributed to the effective binding of metal cations
with carbonyl, hydroxyl, and triazole functionalities present in BTC.
The binding of the BTC with metal ions facilitates the accessibility
of metal ions at the electrode–solution interface and enhances
the electroplating efficacy in the deposition step. Moreover, the
electron-rich functionalities in the BTC molecules offer adsorption
sites for metal ions to form a metal atom–metal ion couple,
which is essential for enhanced current responses. Therefore, the
immobilized layer of BTC serves as a venturing stone among metal ions
(analytes) and electrodes for rapid electron transfer. The modifier
is insoluble in water due to its hydrophobic nature. Therefore, when
the modified electrode is kept in solution for analyte detection,
the modifier stays on the electrode and does not go into the analyte
solution. We anticipate that the excellent conductivity of the used
modifier is due to the presence of electron-rich functionalities in
its chemical structure, orientation of its water soluble moieties
toward the solution, and their ability of bending to act as a communication
link between the electrode and analytes.

Figure 3 SWASV of the (a) modified
electrode in solvent (water and BRB of pH 3.0) and (b) unmodified
and (c) modified electrodes in 1.2 mM solutions of Zn(II), Pb(II),
As(III), and Hg(II) at a scan rate of 50 mV/s and deposition time
of 50 s.

2.4 Optimization
of Experimental Conditions
The influence of stripping conditions
such as the amount of modifier, pH of the sample, supporting electrolyte,
scan rate, accumulation potential, and accumulation time on voltammetric
responses of the selected metal ions was examined with the BTC-modified
GCE. The details are given below.

2.4.1 Amount
of Modifier
The effect of the concentration of BTC on the
current values of metal ions was investigated, and the increase in
the peak current was observed until the achievement of the saturation
point. The enhancement in current signals with an increase in the
concentration of the modifier indicates an increase in the surface
area of the GCE. Meanwhile, a further increase in the modifier concentration
after the saturation point leads to a decrease in peak current values.
The decrement in current signals is because of the multilayer formation
of BTC molecules on the GCE surface and results in deactivation of
the modified electrode due to hindrance of the electron transmission
processes. The maximum peak current values (the saturation point)
for Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) were observed at 1 mM concentration
of BTC as shown in Figure 4.

Figure 4 Effect of immobilized dosage of BTC on the striping peak current
of metal ions, i.e., Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II).

2.4.2 Accumulation Time
The deposition
time was also found to play a critical role in improving the sensitivity
of the modified GCE. The effect of accumulation time on the voltammetric
response of the selected metal ions was studied within the range of
10 to 60 s using SWASV as shown in Figure 5. It was found that the current values increase
linearly with the increase in accumulation time as more metal ions
get reduced on the surface of the modified electrode. A further increase
in the accumulation time led to a decrease in peak current values
probably due to the rapid saturation of the active sites on BTC by
metal ions. The highest current response was obtained at 50 s, which
was thus considered to be the optimum time for further experiments.

Figure 5 Effect
of accumulation time on the SWASV current response for 1.2 mM solutions
of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II). The supporting electrolyte
is BRB (pH = 3), the scan rate is 50 mV/s, and the pulse amplitude
is 25 mV (inset plot of Ip vs td).

2.4.3 Accumulation Potential
Similarly, the
deposition potential is another important parameter to be considered
in electrochemical detections; thus, the effect of the deposition
potential on electrode sensitivity was performed for Zn(II), Pb(II),
As(III), and Hg(II) in the deposition potential range of −1
to −1.4 V. The enhancement in the current signals was observed
in the potential window of −1.0 to −1.2 V. A further
increase in potential from −1.2 to −1.4 V leads to a
decrease in current signals. This reduction in current signals at
a higher negative potential is because of the hydrogen gas evolution.
Hence, further experiments were performed at the selected optimum
deposition potential of −1.2 V in order to avoid hydrogen gas
evolution for best sensing results (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information).

2.4.4 Supporting
Electrolytes
The effect of various supporting electrolytes,
that is, BRB of pH 3, KCl, CH3COOH, H3PO4, and HCl solutions on the current signals of metal ions was
also investigated as shown in Figure S2 of the Supporting Information. The optimum results were obtained
in the presence of BRB (pH = 3), and therefore BRB (pH = 3) was selected
as an electrolyte in further experiments.

2.4.5 pH
Effect
The ionization of various functional groups present
in the structure of BTC responsible for binding metal ions is highly
affected by the pH of the solution. Thus, the effect of pH was studied
by varying the pH of the analyte solution from pH 2 to pH 6 in order
to assess the sensing ability of the electrode. The best response
was observed at pH 3 as shown in Figure 6. The enhancement in current signals at pH
3 is because of the rapid exchange of metal ions with the protons
generated by functional groups of modifiers. The corresponding decrease
in peak current values at higher-pH media could be the result of a
decrease in ionization of functional groups and availability of fewer
ion-exchange sites by hydrolysis of metal ions.

Figure 6 Effect of pH on the current
signal of 1.2 mM solutions of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II)
using the BTC-modified GCE in BRB of different pH values of 2–6
under optimized conditions.

2.5 Interference Study
In real samples,
various other competitive metal ions are also present along with the
analytes and can influence the sensing of a particular analyte. Therefore,
the effect of various possible metal ions on the electrode sensing
of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) was investigated in the present
work. The metal ions used as interfering agents were K+, Cr2+, Na+, Co2+, Cd2+, Mg2+, and Cu2+. It can be observed from Figure 7 that the presence
of interfering species in a two-fold higher concentration than that
of the analyte slightly affects the peak currents of the target analytes,
thus signifying resistance of the developed electrochemical sensor
for interfering ions.

voltammogram and (b) peak current of the analytes using the BTC-modified
GCE.

2.6 Reproducibility
of the Bis-triazole-Based Calix[4]arene-Modified GCE
In order
to assess the reproducibility of the modified electrode, six repetitive
oxidative measurements of electrodeposited Zn(0), As(0), Hg(0), and
Pb(0) were recorded by the BTC-modified GCE using SWASV as shown in Figure S3. No obvious contradictions in the stripping
current values of 0.8 mM Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) were
found. These results justify significant reproducibility of the modified
electrochemical sensing platform. The relative standard deviation
(RSD) was calculated to be less than 4%. Hence, the developed BTC-modified
GCE displayed adequate reproducibility for repetitive electrochemical
determinations of heavy metal ions.

2.7 Simultaneous
Determination of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II)
SWASV
was also used for the simultaneous detection of the selected metal
ions under optimized conditions. The resulting electrochemical sensor
showed a robust analytical response at different concentrations of
Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) as shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 SWASV curves obtained for simultaneous detection
of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) in the concentration range
of 0.9 mM to 7 nM with the BTC-modified GCE.

Excellent calibration curves were obtained for Zn(II), Pb(II), Hg(II),
and As(III) in the concentration range of 0.9 mM to 7 nM with regression
coefficients of 0.9974, 0.998, 0.998, and 0.998, respectively. The
limits of detection found for Zn(II), Pb(II), Hg(II), and As(III)
with respective values of 66.3, 14.6, 28.9, and 71.9 pM are tabulated
in Table 1. These LOD
values are also lower than those reported in the literature.36−43

2.8 Analysis of Real Samples
In order
to check the accuracy of the proposed electrochemical sensing method
in real-world outdoor applications, the BTC-modified GCE was employed
for monitoring Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) in real water samples
collected from Rawal Lake, Islamabad, Pakistan, tap water, and drinking
water. In this experiment, the stock solutions of metal ions in real
water samples were diluted with 50% BRB (pH = 3) with no more sample
treatment. The amounts of Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) in lake,
tap, and drinking water samples were determined by the traditional
standard addition method by spiking known amounts of Zn(II), Pb(II),
As(III), and Hg(II). Excellent recoveries were observed for Zn(II),
Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II) in all three samples listed in Table 2.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we introduced novel bis-triazole-based calix[4]arene-modified
GCE for the simultaneous sensing of four types of metal ions, that
is, Zn(II), Pb(II), As(III), and Hg(II). The modifier resulted in
a higher surface area of the electrode, increased metal ion accumulation
at the electrode/electrolyte interface, and improved conductivity
resulting in enhanced sensitivity and performance of the designed
electrochemical platform. The designed modified electrode is cost
effective, easy to fabricate, regenerative, and environmentally benign.
The voltammetric stripping measurements showed that the designed electrode
surface has excellent repeatability and high sensitivity and selectivity.
It also showed good reproducibility and displayed wide linear concentration
ranges for the respective target analytes with detection limits of
66.3, 14.6, 28.9, and 71.9 pM for Zn(II), Pb(II), Hg(II), and As(III),
respectively. In addition, the recommended sensing platform was effectively
utilized for the simultaneous detection of these ions in real water
samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemical
Reagents
All chemicals used in this study were of analytical
grade and used without any further purification. The Britton-Robinson
buffer (BRB) was employed as a supporting electrolyte in the pH range
2–6. Deionized water was used for the preparation of different
metal ion solutions, and the solution of BTC was prepared in DMSO.
The experiments were performed under a nitrogen gas atmosphere in
order to evacuate atmospheric oxygen and avoid unnecessary oxidation.

4.2 Apparatus
Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) and voltammetric investigations were performed via Metrohm Autolab
PGSTAT 302 N. The conventionally used three-electrode system was employed
including bare and modified glassy carbon electrodes (GCEs) as the
working electrode, Ag/AgCl (saturated KCl electrode) as the reference,
and platinum wire as a counter electrode. The pH measurements were
carried out by an INOLAB pH meter.

4.3 Preparation
of the Modified Glassy Carbon Electrode
First, the GCE surface
was polished with the help of a nylon buffing pad using 0.05 μm
of α-Al2O3 powder until a smooth and shiny
surface of the GCE was attained. Later, the GCE was sonicated for
2 min in HNO3 (1:1, v/v), alcohol, and double-distilled
water followed by washing with distilled water and drying in air.
The stock solution of BTC, having its chemical structure
shown in Scheme 2,
was prepared in DMSO. Voltammetric studies were performed using both
bare and modified GCEs. The modification of the GCE was carried out
by the drop-casting method in order to enhance the surface properties
of the GCE.
