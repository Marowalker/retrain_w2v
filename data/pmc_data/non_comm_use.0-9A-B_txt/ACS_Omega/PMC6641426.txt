In this article,
a mechanism for quick release and transfer of
gold nanoparticles (GNPs) from a soft substrate to another substrate
under laser illumination is investigated. The heating of GNPs on a
soft substrate with a continuous-wave laser causes a rapid thermal
expansion of the substrate, which can be used to selectively release
and place GNPs onto another surface. In-plane and out-of-plane nanostructures
are successfully fabricated using this method. This rapid release-and-place
process can be used for additive nonmanufacturing of metallic nanostructures
under ambient conditions, which paves a way for affordable nanomanufacturing
and enables a wide variety of applications in nanophotonics, ultrasensitive
sensing, and nonlinear plasmonics.

Introduction
Additive manufacturing
at the macroscale has already been used
for rapid prototyping. However, such a rapid prototyping technique
is yet to be developed for manufacturing at the nanoscale or nanomanufacturing.1 The terms “nonmanufacturing” and
“nanofabrication” are often used interchangeably,2 although Liddle and Gallatin have distinguished
these two terms by using the criterion of economic viability.3 There are a large number of nanomanufacturing
approaches available, but only a few are suitable for additive nanomanufacturing.
Manufacturing of metallic nanostructures with small gaps, such as
nanodimers, is practically important for many applications including
surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy4,5 and nonlinear
plasmonics.6,7

Colloidal nanoparticles have been
used as building blocks for this
purpose because of the ease of massive production with well-designed
size, shape, and superior crystal.8−12 For example, gold nanodimers can be formed by linking
individual nanoparticles with deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).13,14 The size of the gap in these nanodimers can be precisely controlled
by the length of the DNA trains. However, this process is still stochastic
and challenging to achieve high yield. Optical printing based on optical
forces is another method that can be potentially used for additive
nanomanufacturing. In this method, nanoparticles in colloidal solution
are first brought close to a surface and then printed on the surface
with a highly focused laser beam because of the strong optical force.15−18 Isolated nanoparticles, such as spherical gold nanoparticles (GNPs),17,19,20 gold nanodisks,21 gold bipyramids,22 and aligned
gold nanorods,15 have been successfully
manufactured using this method. However, it is still challenging to
manufacture nanostructures with small gaps using this method because
of the thermophoretic repulsive force,15,21,23−25 which limits the minimum size
of the gap that can be formed between two adjacent nanoparticles.
Several alternative approaches have been proposed to overcome this
limitation such as printing nanoparticles on a thermo-responsive flexible
polymer film,25 selective printing of different
types of metallic nanoparticles with lasers of different wavelengths,23 and printing on a substrate with high thermal
conductivity.21 However, these methods
are typically applicable in aqueous solution and are not suitable
for certain applications where surface contamination has to be avoided.

In this article, we demonstrate a quick release-and-place approach
that can be used to selectively release GNPs from a soft substrate
and transfer them additively to any other substrates. The whole process
is accomplished in the air, and there is no requirement for vacuum
or high voltage. Individual GNPs can be released in sequence and placed
additively to form two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D)
nanostructures without worrying about the thermophoretic force that
limits the minimum gap between adjacent nanoparticles as that exists
in the optical printing method.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a schematically
shows the experimental setup of the release-and-place approach, which
is based on the heating of GNPs and rapid thermal expansion of a soft
substrate. A continuous-wave (CW) laser with a wavelength of 1064
nm serves as the heating laser. The laser beam is first expanded with
two lenses (L1 and L2) and then reflected by a dichroic mirror (DM).
Finally, it is focused on the sample with an oil-immersion objective
lens (O1, NA = 1.25, 100×). The laser beam overfills the back
aperture of O1 to make full use of the numerical aperture (NA). A
fraction of the laser is picked up by a beam splitter (BS), and its
power is measured with a power meter (PM). The laser power at the
focus of O1 can be calibrated and calculated from the power measured
on PM. A variable neutral density filter (ND) is used to adjust the
laser power. A shutter (S) is used to switch the laser on and off.
A plastic (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) coverslip (Ted Pella, Inc., 22
× 22 × 0.18 mm) is placed on a translation stage (TS2) for
precise position control. Colloidal GNPs with a diameter of 200 nm
from BBI solutions are diluted to 20 v/v % and then drop-cast on this
PVC substrate. The GNP solution is then left naturally dried on the
substrate.

A second substrate can be mounted on another translation
stage
(TS1) and suspended on top of the PVC substrate. A ring-shaped light-emitting
diode light source is used for illumination, and the GNPs on the PVC
substrate are imaged on a camera with the same objective lens O1 and
a tube lens (TL). The location of the heating laser is marked on the
camera for precise orientation of the targeted GNP. GNPs on the PVC
substrate can be moved to the focus of the heating laser and released
from the substrate, as schematically shown in Figure 1b. Because GNPs will be released from this
substrate, we call them donor substrate (a PVC substrate in this case)
in this article unless stated otherwise. Figure 1c shows the optical image of a GNP on the
donor substrate when the laser is off. The red circle indicates the
area to be illuminated with the heating laser. Once the heating laser
is switched on, the GNP is immediately released from the donor substrate. Figure 1d shows the same
optical image after the laser is turned on. The GNP in the red circle
is released from the donor substrate and transferred to another substrate
placed on top of it. The release of a GNP from the donor substrate
is also shown in Supporting Video 1 in the Supporting Information. Because GNPs are transferred to the top substrate,
we call them receiver substrate (a glass coverslip in this case) in
this article unless stated otherwise. Figure 1e shows the optical image of the receiver
substrate after the release-and-place process. The black dot in the
red circle shows the GNP that is placed on the receiver substrate,
whose optical image is blurred because of the spherical aberration
of O1 when imaging through the air. The experiment has been repeated
by replacing the GNP with a polymer bead (diameter of 2.1 μm);
however, the polymer bead cannot be released from the substrate as
shown in the Supporting Information (Figure
S1). This control experiment manifests the importance of effective
light absorption and heating of particles for this method.

The
donor substrate needs to be a soft substrate for a successful
release-and-place process. However, there is no limitation on the
type of the receiver substrate used in this method. When a GNP is
illuminated with a CW laser, it serves as an efficient nanoheating
source and converts the laser energy into heat.26−28 The heating
of the GNP induces a rapid thermal expansion of the donor substrate
beneath the GNP, which gives the GNP an upward momentum and lifts
the GNP off the donor substrate. To verify the aforementioned mechanism
and exclude other possible forces such as optical force in this process,
the following control experiments are conducted:(1) Hard substrate: Figure 2a schematically shows
the experimental configuration.
Colloidal GNP solution is dried on a glass substrate (Ted Pella, Inc.,
micro cover glasses, 22 × 22 mm × 0.16–0.19 mm thick)
following the same procedure as described earlier. Figure 2b shows the optical image of
a cluster of GNPs on the glass substrate when the laser is off (left
panel), on (middle panel), and off again (right panel). The visible
light emission from the GNPs shown in the middle panel of Figure 2b may originate from
the thermal radiation of the GNPs. However, the GNPs are still on
the substrate after laser heating (refer to Supporting Video 2, Supporting Information for more details on this
process). This experiment clearly shows that GNPs cannot be released
from a hard substrate.

(2) Soft film on a hard substrate: to
verify that a soft substrate plays the key role in this process, the
same experiment is conducted on a soft film on a hard substrate. A
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film with a thickness of 100 μm
is spin-coated on a glass coverslip. A PDMS solution is prepared by
mixing Sylgard 184 silicone elastomer base and curing agent (Dow Corning
Corporation, Michigan, USA).29 The colloidal
solution of the GNPs is then drop-cast on the PDMS film and naturally
dried. Figure 2c,d
shows that a GNP can be released from the PDMS film (refer to Supporting
Video 3, Supporting Information for more
details on this process).

(3) Exclude optical radiation force: the
optical radiation force on the GNP that originates from the light
momentum transfer may also play an important role in the release process.
To justify the effect of this force on the release process, the same
soft film on a hard substrate is used for this experiment. However,
the laser is focused on a cluster of GNPs in the opposite direction,
as schematically shown in Figure 2e. If the optical radiation force dominates in this
process, the GNPs would be pushed in the direction of the laser, that
is, into the PDMS film. However, the GNPs are still released from
the PDMS film in a direction that is opposite to the incident laser
direction, as shown in Figure 2f (refer to Supporting Video 4, Supporting Information for more details on this process). This control
experiment clearly shows that the optical force does not dominate
in the release process.



Figure 2 (a,b) GNPs cannot be
released from a hard substrate. (c,d) GNPs
can be released from a PDMS film on a hard substrate. (e,f) GNPs can
be released from a flexible substrate in a direction opposite to the
direction of optical radiation force. The white dashed arrow in (e)
shows the moving direction of the GNPs that are released from the
surface.

To further understand this release
process, we simulated the thermal
expansion of a PVC substrate because of the heating of a GNP by using
a finite element method (COMSOL Multiphysics). The heat source (Q) comes from the heating of a GNP (diameter 200 nm) with
a CW laser beam (1064 nm). The value of the heat source is calculated
as 1  where
σabs, I, and VGNP are the absorption cross section,
laser intensity, and the volume of the GNP, respectively. The absorption
cross section σabs of a 200 nm GNP (surrounded by
air on a PVC substrate) for a 1064 nm laser is calculated by using
the Mie theory with an effective refractive index of neff = 0.23nsub + 0.77nair following ref (26). The refractive index of gold is taken from
ref (30). The laser
intensity used in the simulation is 45 mW/μm2. The
temperature-dependent material properties of a GNP and a plastic (PVC)
substrate used in the simulation are obtained from refs (31)–36.

Figure 3a shows
the displacement of the GNP as well as the temperature distribution
at 93 ns after laser illumination. The substrate’s surface
underneath the GNP expands and pushes the GNP upward in the same direction.
The GNP gains momentum because of the expansion of the plastic substrate
but still remains in contact with the substrate because of van der
Waals force. The expansion of the PVC substrate continues until the
GNP gains enough momentum to overcome the van der Waals force between
the GNP and the substrate before it is released from the substrate. Figure 3b shows the release
of the GNP from the substrate with a displacement of 96 nm from the
substrate’s surface at 216 ns after laser illumination. Notice
that the temperature of the GNP decreases because of the displacement
from the laser focus (Supporting Information, Supporting Video 5). Figure 3c shows the velocity and displacement of the GNP as well as
the substrate surface. The velocity of the GNP remains the same with
the substrate surface and increases at the beginning of the release
process because of the increased thermal expansion rate of the substrate.
The expanding substrate surface pushes the GNP upward with the same
velocity and is still in contact with the GNP. The velocity of the
substrate’s surface reaches a maximum of 1.35 m/s at 30 ns
and begins to decrease because of the reduced expansion rate of the
substrate. A detailed explanation of the particle release process
can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). If the PVC substrate is replaced by a PDMS substrate,
it undergoes the same process. The thermal expansion of a PDMS substrate
due to the heating of a GNP is shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3).

illumination, respectively. The red circle shows the original position
of the GNP on the substrate before laser illumination. (c) Displacement
and velocity of the GNP and the substrate’s surface under laser
illumination.

Here, the gravitational
force of the GNP has been ignored because
it is 7 orders of magnitude smaller than the van der Waals force.
The van der Waals force is calculated as follows37 2  where AG and Asub are Hamaker constants
of the GNP and the
PVC substrate, respectively.38r is the radius of the GNP. D is the separation
between the GNP and the substrate. The van der Waals force decreases
dramatically as the gap between the GNP and the substrate increases,
as shown in Figure 4a. Because of the surface roughness of the plastic substrate, we
consider an effective gap of 2 nm between the GNP and the PVC substrate,
which results in a van der Waals force of 0.95 nN similar to that
used in the simulation.

PVC substrate. The
inset shows the optical image of the area from where the GNP is released.
(b) Minimum laser intensity that is required to release a 200 nm GNP
from a PVC substrate for lasers of different wavelengths. The inset
shows the detail of the curve as marked by the black arrow.

It should be noted that the simulation
demonstrated here is a simplified
model to illustrate the working principle of the release process.
In reality, the substrate’s surface beneath the GNP can be
melted because of the high temperature of the GNP. The inset in Figure 4a shows the optical
image of the PVC substrate after a GNP is released. The area beneath
the GNP is marked in the black circle, which shows the surface morphology
change once a GNP is released. In this case, not only the van der
Waals force but also the surface tension between the GNP and the melted
surface contribute in the release process. The surface tension between
a GNP and a liquid surface can be approximately represented by the
following equation39 3  where r is the radius of
the particle and γ is the surface tension of the liquid. However,
in the case of the interaction between a spherical particle and a
liquid droplet, this force strongly depends on the ratio of the particle
to the droplet size ν = r/R, where r and R are the radii of
the particle and the droplet, respectively. Therefore, the analytical
expression of the surface tension can be given by the following equation
in the limit of small ν40 4  where μ
is a parameter which depends
on ν and the contact angle between the particle and the liquid
droplet.40 Force increases with the increase
of contact angle but decreases with the increases of the ratio of
particle to droplet size (ν). In our experiment, we can approximately
take the melted surface as a liquid droplet with a radius of 215 nm
(ν = 0.46) as measured from the inset of Figure 4a. Therefore, assuming the contact angle
θ = 90°, the approximate value of surface tension can be
found as 6 nN, which is larger than that of the van der Waals force.
Therefore, the dominant force at the moment of the GNP release will
be the surface tension.

Various capping agents (surfactants,
ligands, polymers, etc.) are
typically used to prepare and stabilize GNPs in the liquid phase and
can also be used to modify the interaction of the GNPs with their
environment. The significance of these capping agents in the self-assembly
of nanoparticles has been studied in different literature.41−44 Moreover, surface wettability also affects the transfer of nanoparticles
from one substrate to another.45 Therefore,
the possible role of the capping agents as well as the wettability
of the substrate needs to be taken into account in the release process.
The GNPs used in our experiment are citrate-stabilized with a negative
surface charge in the solution; however, the GNP colloidal solution
is completely dried on the substrate before the release process. Therefore,
the surface charge of the GNPs differs from its native aqueous environment
and is not characterized in our experiment. Basically, the surface
charges of the GNPs will contribute an additional electrostatic force
being attractive (with a surface charge of opposite sign to the substrate)
or repulsive (with a surface charge of the same sign to the substrate)
in the release-and-place process. In addition, the water molecules
in humid air can enter the gaps between the GNPs and the substrate
and absorbed on a sufficiently hydrophilic surface, which induces
a capillary force on the GNP.46−48 However, the relative importance
of this capillary force strongly depends on the relative humidity
(RH) of the air.49,50 The capillary force is generally
negligible when the RH is below 50%.51 In
our experiment, the RH is kept at 36%. Therefore, we neglected the
capillary force in our analysis.

In our experimental conditions,
a GNP can be released from the
donor (PVC) substrate with a minimum laser intensity of 11 mW/μm2. It should be noted that the minimum laser intensity that
is required to release a GNP can be further reduced by changing the
laser wavelength. Figure 4b shows the calculated minimum laser intensity that is required
to release a 200 nm GNP from a PVC substrate by using lasers of different
wavelengths. In this calculation, the experimental minimum laser intensity
of 11 mW/μm2 for the 1064 nm laser is taken as a
reference and we assume that a GNP will be released from the substrate
by the lasers of different wavelengths when the absorbed power (P = σabsI) by the GNP
is similar to that of the reference condition. A laser with a shorter
wavelength is preferred to efficiently heat the GNP and release it
from the substrate. A GNP can be released from a PVC substrate with
a minimum of 0.31 mW/μm2 with a 508 nm laser, as
shown in the inset of Figure 4b.

This rapid release process allows us to selectively
and additively
transfer GNPs to other substrates to form 2D or even 3D nanostructures.
Here, we demonstrate the additive nanomanufacturing of gold nanodimers
and nanotrimers on the core area of a fiber tip as a proof of concept.
In this experiment, a PVC substrate with a thickness of 0.18 mm is
used as the donor substrate. A single-mode fiber (Newport, core diameter:
3.4 μm, cladding diameter: 125 μm) that is placed on top
of the donor substrate is used as the receiver substrate, as schematically
shown in Figure 5a.
The receiver substrate shown in Figure 1a is replaced with this optical fiber. The optical
fiber is mounted on the translation stage TS1 and is brought close
to the donor substrate. Figure 5b shows a part of the experimental setup (an objective lens,
a translational stage TS2, a donor substrate, a fiber holder, and
a fiber tip) used for this experiment.

Figure 5 (a) Schematic of the
experimental setup for additive nanomanufacturing
on the fiber tip. (b) Part of the experimental setup. (c) Optical
image of the fiber tip. (d) Optical image of the fiber tip after transferring
several GNPs on it. (e) SEM image of the fiber tip. (f) SEM image
of an in-plane gold nanotrimer on the fiber tip. (g) SEM image of
an out-plane gold nanodimer on the fiber tip.

The light from a green laser is coupled into the optical
fiber
and the output light from the fiber tip is imaged on the same camera
as shown in Figure 1a, where the position of the heating laser is marked. Figure 5c shows the optical image of
the fiber tip with the core area clearly visible, which allows us
to precisely align the fiber tip to the GNPs that need to be released
from the substrate. The GNPs are moved in the heating laser one by
one by moving the translation stage TS2. Once a GNP is released from
the PVC substrate and placed on the fiber tip, the next GNP is moved
in the heating laser and placed additively on the fiber tip. This
process continues till the desired number of GNPs is fabricated on
the core area of the fiber tip. Figure 5d shows the optical image of the same fiber tip after
several GNPs are additively placed on the fiber. The scattering light
from the GNPs is clearly seen in the image. Figure 5e shows the corresponding scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) image of the optical fiber after the release-and-place
process. Because of the surface roughness of the PVC substrate, each
GNP in the release-and-place process does not always follow the same
trajectory, but some GNPs do follow similar trajectories, which form
closely packed gold nanodimers and nanotrimers as shown in the two
black boxes (marked as 1 and 2 in Figure 5e). The corresponding SEM images at a higher
magnification are shown in Figure 5f,g, respectively. Each GNP is fabricated on the fiber
tip that is away from the focus of the heating laser; therefore, there
is no need to worry about the thermophoretic repulsive force that
exists in the optical printing methods.15,21,23−25 This means that there is no limitation
on the smallest gap that can be formed between two adjacent GNPs. Figure 5f shows the SEM image
of an in-plane gold nanotrimer consisting of three touching GNPs.
Here, in-plane means the nanotrimer lies in a plane parallel to the
fiber surface. Figure 5g shows the SEM image of an out-plane nanodimer consisting of two
stacked GNPs. Here, out-plane means the nanodimer lies in a direction
that is normal to the fiber surface.

In spite of the stochastic
nature of the additive manufacturing
method demonstrated in this article, its low-cost and easy-to-implement
properties introduce a new way for affordable and rapid prototyping.
The fabrication accuracy of this method can be potentially improved
by the following three steps, which will be investigated in our future
works: (1) improve the flatness of the donor substrate by spin-coating
a polymer (such as PDMS) on an ultraflat substrate; (2) reduce and
optimize the distance between the receiver substrate and the donor
substrate; and (3) apply an electric field between the donor and the
receiver substrate.

Conclusions
In conclusion, an affordable
additive nanomanufacturing method
is investigated in this article. Because of the heating of the GNP
and the rapid surface expansion of the soft donor substrate, GNPs
can be additively transferred to any receiver substrate. There is
no limitation on the type of the receiver substrate for this method.
In addition, no expensive pulsed laser is required for this approach.
The use of a low-cost CW laser makes affordable and rapid prototyping
of closely packed nanostructures possible. It should be noted that
the method demonstrated in this article is different from direct laser
ablation,52−55 where expensive pulsed lasers are used to ablate the materials disruptively
and the fabricated nanostructures are limited to spherical shapes
only. The method demonstrated in this article has no damage on the
nanostructures to be released from the substrate. Nanostructures with
any desired shapes can be selectively and nondestructively released
from a donor substrate and additively transferred to another substrate.
Therefore, this method paves a potential new way of manufacturing
nanostructures with small gaps for applications in ultrafast sensing
and nonlinear optics.
