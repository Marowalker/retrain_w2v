Key roles of bisulfite
(HSO3–) in
food quality assurance and human health necessitate a reliable analytical
method for rapid, sensitive, and selective detection of HSO3–. Herein, a new red-emitting ratiometric fluorescence
probe, BIQ, is reported for sensitive and selective detection
of HSO3– in food samples and live animals.
Probe BIQ recognizes HSO3– via a 1,4-nucleophilic addition reaction. As a result of this specific
reaction, emission intensities at 625 and 475 nm are dramatically
changed, allowing the detection of HSO3– in a ratiometric fluorescence model in an aqueous solution. The
obvious changes of solution color from pink to transparent and fluorescence
color from rose-red to cyan allow the detection of HSO3– by naked eyes. Furthermore, probe BIQ has fast response in color and fluorescence (<2 min), excellent
selectivity, and a low detection limit (0.29 μM), which enables
its application in HSO3– detection in
food samples and live organisms. The practical applications of probe BIQ are then demonstrated by the visualization of HSO3– in live animals (zebrafish and nude mouse)
as well as the determination of HSO3– in white wine and sugar.

1 Introduction
Bisulfite
(HSO3–) is an important
reactive sulfur species (RSS) that plays a key role either in the
physiological system or in the food industry.1−7 Under physiological conditions, HSO3– is mainly generated through reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated
oxidation of cysteine and glutathione.8,9 In the biological
system, toxicological studies unveil that HSO3– at a low concentration (<450 μM) contributes significantly
to vasodilation in cardiovascular systems.10−13 However, the elevated expression
of HSO3– in vivo is implicated in a series
of diseases, such as lung and brain cancers, strokes, and migraine.14 In the food industry, HSO3– is as an effective preservative to protect food, beverages, and
even pharmaceutical products from spoilage due to its antioxidant
and enzyme-inhibition properties.15−17 Since extensive intake
of HSO3– may potentially trigger allergic
reactions or even lead to tissue damage in some individuals, the amount
of HSO3– in food is strictly controlled.18 For example, the amount of sulfur (calculated
by the SO2 content) in refined white sugar should be lower
than 0.1 g/kg in China. While in the the USA, products with sulfite
level higher than 10 μg/mL must be clearly labeled.19,20 Hence, developing new methods for HSO3– detection in both biological system and food samples is of great
significance.

Among the reported HSO3– detection
methods,21−28 such as spectrophotometry, chromatography, and capillary electrophoresis,
fluoremetry has drawn increasing attention due to its obvious advantages
such as excellent sensitivity, selectivity, capability of detection
in situ, and easy for naked-eye visualization.29−31 To date, a
number of molecular fluorescence probes for HSO3– have been developed by exploiting several response reaction mechanisms,
such as a nucleophilic reaction with aldehyde,32−35 deprotection of the levulinate
group,21 hydrogen bonding,36 and a nucleophilic addition reaction with the C=C
bond.37−44 Of these fluorescence probes, ratiometric florescence probes with
the improved signal-to-noise ratio are more reliable for the detection
of HSO3–.45−47 However, some problems
of these reported fluorescent probes are (i) relatively long reaction
time (30 min to 10 h) and (ii) poor selectivity and sensitivity.48 These limitations seriously retarded the application
of the fluorescence probe for the detection of HSO3– in biological and food samples.

In the present
work, a new probe (BIQ) for the ratiometric
fluorescence detection of HSO3– in live
animals and in food samples is developed (Scheme 1). Probe BIQ was synthesized
by a one-step condensation reaction between quinoline derivatives
and benzimidazole. The large π-conjugation system, thus formed,
with typical intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character endows
probe BIQ with a red emission at 625 nm. In the presence
of HSO3–, the electron-deficient C=C
double bond linker is able to react with HSO3– through an established mechanism of the 1,4-addition reaction.37−44 As a result, the π-conjugation system of BIQ is
interrupted, resulting in dramatic changes of ultraviolet–visible
(UV–vis) absorption and fluorescence spectra. Introducing an
electron withdrawing group (−CN) promoted the reaction between
C=C bond and HSO3– to be completed
within 2 min. The ratiometric/colorimetric responses of BIQ toward HSO3– showed high selectivity
over other competitive biologically relevant species. The applications
of BIQ for HSO3– detection
in zebrafish, mice, and food samples were then demonstrated.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 UV–Vis Spectra Response
of the BIQ
Toward HSO3–
UV–vis absorption
response of probe BIQ to HSO3– was first evaluated in 20 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer of pH 7.4 (containing
30% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a cosolvent). As shown in Figure 1A, probe BIQ exhibited a prominent absorption band centered at 480 nm, which
can be attributed to the ICT process of probe BIQ.18 Upon the addition of HSO3– (0–250 μM), this absorption gradually decreased and
the maximum absorption change was obtained when the concentration
of HSO3– reached to 200 μM (Figure 1A, inset). To evaluate
the selectivity of probe BIQ toward HSO3–, changes of BIQ’s absorption spectra
were recorded in the presence of common interference species, including
HSO3–, Br–, Cl–, F–, HSO4–, S2–, NO2–, NO3–, 1O2, OH–, ONOO–, P2O74–, PO42–, SO32–, SO42–, HCO3–, Pi, PPi, H2O2, Cys, Hcy, GSH, HOCl, and AcO–. As shown in Figure 1B, negligible UV–vis spectra changes were noticed
upon the addition of interference species, indicating high selectivity
of probe BIQ for HSO3– detection.
The specificity of the UV–vis response of probe BIQ toward HSO3– was then validated by
a naked-eye colorimetric assay. As shown in Figure 1C, the color of the probe BIQ solution was
changed from pale orange to colorless in the presence HSO3–.

μM) in the presence of different amounts of HSO3– (0–250 μM) in HEPES aqueous buffer (DMSO/H2O=3:7, 20 mM, pH = 7.4). Inset: absorbance of probe BIQ at 480 nm as a function of HSO3–concentration. (B) Absorption spectra and (C) color changes of probe BIQ (10 μM) upon the addition of various competitive
analytes (200 μM): 1. Blank, 2. HSO3–, 3. Br–, 4. Cl–, 5. F–, 6. HSO4–, 7. S2–, 8. NO2–, 9. NO3–, 10. 1O2, 11. OH–, 12. ONOO–, 13. P2O74–, 14. PO42–, 15. SO32–, 6. SO42–, 17. HCO3–, 18. Pi, 19. PPi, 20. H2O2, 21. Cys, 22. Hcy, 23. GSH, 24. HOCl, and 25. AcO–.

2.2 Fluorescence
Response of Probe BIQ to HSO3–
Fluorescence response of probe BIQ to HSO3– was then examined
by titration analysis in HEPES buffer. As shown in Figure S4, no obvious changes of emission spectra were obtained
after the incubation of probe BIQ in HEPES buffer for
30 h, suggesting high stability of BIQ in the aqueous
solution. Probe BIQ exhibited strong red fluorescence
at 625 nm (Φ1 = 0.4314) while nearly nonemissive
at 475 nm (Φ2 = 0.019). Upon the addition of HSO3– to the probe BIQ solution,
a remarkable ratiometric fluorescence response was obtained with two
emission bands at 475 and 625 nm. As shown in Figure 2A, the emission peak at 625 nm decreased
gradually (Φ3 = 0.0824) accompanied by a significant
increase of fluorescence at 475 nm (Φ4 = 0.5843)
with the increase of HSO3– concentration.
The maximum emission change was obtained when 200 μM HSO3– was added (Figure 2B). In addition, distinct fluorescence color
changes of probe BIQ from rose-red to cyan were obtained
upon the addition of HSO3– (Figure 2A, inset).

Figure 2 (A) Fluorescence
response of probe BIQ (10 μM)
toward various amounts of HSO3– (0–250
μM) in HEPES aqueous buffer (DMSO/H2O = 3:7, v/v,
20 mM, pH = 7.4). (B) Fluorescence emission intensities of probe BIQ at 475 and 625 nm as a function of different HSO3– concentrations. Excitation was performed at 380
and 460 nm, respectively.

The fluorescence ratio (F625nm/F475nm) was linearly proportional to the concentration
of HSO3– (Figure S6). The detection of limit (LOD) was calculated to be 0.29
μM according to the IUPAC criteria (LOD = 3σ/k). Such a low detection limit allowed HSO3– detection in food samples and live animals. The nucleophilic addition
reaction between BIQ and HSO3– was then studied by Job’s plot analysis. The changes of fluorescence
intensities at 625 nm against the mole fraction of HSO3– clearly showed the maximum value at around 0.5
(Figure S7), indicating the 1:1 stoichiometry
nucleophilic reaction between BIQ and HSO3–.49,50

Next, the selectivity of
probe BIQ to HSO3– over
other competitive analytes (Br–, Cl–, F–, HSO4–, S2–, NO2–, NO3–, 1O2, OH–, ONOO–, P2O74–, PO42–, SO32–, SO42–,
HCO3–, Pi, PPi, H2O2, Cys, Hcy, GSH, HOCl, AcO–) was evaluated by monitoring
the fluorescence spectra and fluorescence intensity at 475 nm (λex = 380 nm) and 625 nm (λex = 470 nm), respectively.
As shown in Figure 3A, no obvious changes in fluorescence spectra of probe BIQ were observed in the presence of other interference species (200
μM). To further investigate the specificity of BIQ, competitive experiments were conducted upon the addition of HSO3– to the above interference species-spiked BIQ solution. As shown in Figure 3B, probe BIQ exhibited similar
fluorescence response toward HSO3– with
the coexistence of other interfering species, indicating high selectivity
of BIQ to HSO3–. The specificity
of BIQ to HSO3– was also
examined by fluorescence color changes, where rose-red fluorescence
emission faded exclusively in the presence of HSO3– (Figure 3C), indicating that probe BIQ is able to detect HSO3– in a complex system under a ratiometric
fluorescence model.

at 380 and 460 nm, respectively. (C) Fluorescence color photos of
probe BIQ (10 μM) in the presence of above analytes.

2.3 Time and pH-Dependent Fluorescence
Responses
of Probe BIQ toward HSO3–
The
time-dependent fluorescence response (F625nm/F475nm) of BIQ in the presence
of different amounts of HSO3– was then
recorded within 200 s in HEPES buffer (Figure 4). Upon the addition of HSO3– (0, 67, 124, and 200 μM), changes of fluorescence
ratio (F625nm/F475nm) reached a plateau within 120 s, indicating that the 1,4-nucleophilic
addition reaction between probe BIQ and HSO3– is completed within 2 min. The speed of the fluorescence
response of BIQ is comparable with some recently reported
HSO3– fluorescence probes.51−54

μM) in HEPES aqueous buffer (DMSO/H2O = 3:7, v/v,

(d) 200 μM. Excitation was performed at 380 and 460 nm, respectively.

In addition, the effect of pH on the fluorescence
response of probe BIQ to HSO3– was investigated
in the absence and the presence of HSO3–. As shown in Figure 5, in the pH range from 4.0 to 11.5, the fluorescence emission ratio
(F625nm/F475nm) of BIQ remained consistent and the fluorescence response
of BIQ to HSO3– was not
affected in such a wide pH range. The result indicates that probe BIQ can be employed for the detection of HSO3– in weak acid, weak base, and neutral conditions.

μM) in the absence and the presence of HSO3–. Excitation was performed at 380 and 460
nm, respectively.

2.4 Detection
of HSO3– in Food Samples
The
feasibility of probe BIQ for HSO3– detection in food samples,
including sugar and wine, was then evaluated using the calibration
curves (Figure S8). As shown in Table 1, for the HSO3–-spiked food samples, the recoveries were
determined to be in the range from 96.62 to 101.83%, indicating the
high accuracy of probe BIQ for HSO3–detection in real food samples.

2.5 Fluorescence Imaging of HSO3– in
Vivo
Next, the application of the probe
in living animals was evaluated through the imaging of HSO3– in adult zebrafish (oral feeding) and nude mouse
(subcutaneous injection). Prior to the imaging application of BIQ in vivo, the cytotoxicity of probe BIQ to
RAW 264.7 cells was evaluated using the MTT assay.55 As shown in Figure S9, no significant
effect on the cell proliferation of BIQ was observed
after coincubation with macrophage cells for 24 h, suggesting low
cytotoxicity of BIQ. For the visualization of HSO3– in zebrafish, live adult zebrafish was
stained in the probe BIQ solution (40 μM) for 5
min. Fluorescence images of the BIQ-stained zebrafish
showed strong fluorescence in the gill and abdomen. However, this
fluorescence signal disappeared when the BIQ-stained
zebrafish was further supplied with HSO3– (Figure 6A). Furthermore,
the mean fluorescence intensity of the gill and abdomen (Figure 6B) also indicates
that probe BIQ can be employed as an imaging agent for
visualizing HSO3– in zebrafish.

in live adult zebrafish: (a) control group of zebrafish only; (b)
zebrafish incubated with probe BIQ (40 μM) for
5 min; (c) zebrafish in (b) with further incubation of HSO3– (1 mM) for (c) 10 min and (d) 20 min. (B) Mean
fluorescence intensity of zebrafish shown in (a–d). The images
of zebrafish were recorded with an excitation filter (465 nm) and
an emission filter (630 nm).

We then investigated the potential of probe BIQ for
the imaging of HSO3– in mice. Probe BIQ (40 μM, 100 μL) was subcutaneously injected
into the left leg of a 6 to 8-week-old nude mouse. After 5 min, the
mice were injected with 20 μL of HSO3– (4 mM) at the same region. The images were then recorded at 5, 10,
and 15 min after the HSO3– injection.
As shown in Figure 7, an intense fluorescence signal was detected in the legs of the
mice after the probe BIQ injection (Figure 7b), while this fluorescence
signal was decreased after the injection of HSO3– along with time and vanished in 15 min, suggesting that probe BIQ was able to be used as an excellent imaging agent for
visualizing HSO3– in vivo.

and images were recorded at different times: (c) 5 min; (d) 10 min;
and (e) 15 min, respectively. The mean fluorescence intensities (a–e)
were calculated and are shown in (f). The mice were imaged with an
excitation filter (465 nm) and an emission filter (625 nm).

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
we have successfully developed a new red-emitting
ratiometric fluorescence probe (BIQ) for HSO3– detection in food and biological samples. The
specific response of probe BIQ toward HSO3– was attributed to the nucleophilic addition reaction
between the electron-deficient C=C bond with HSO3–. A dramatic hypochromatic shift of emission spectra
from 625 to 475 nm and a color change were obtained within 2.0 min.
Probe BIQ exhibits high sensitivity, specificity, strong
red emission, and a low detection limit to HSO3–. The successful applications of BIQ in the imaging
of HSO3– in live animals and the detection
of HSO3– in food samples indicate that
probe BIQ could be further used as a tool for investigating
the biological roles of HSO3– in living
systems and for evaluating the safety of HSO3– in food samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Instruments
Selenium
dioxide and malononitrile were received from Aladdin reagent Co. (Shanghai,
China). N,N-Dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine was obtained from Energy Chemical. Piperidine,
1,2-diaminobenzene, potassium carbonate (K2CO3), phosphorus oxychloride, metal ions (nitrate salts), anions (sodium
salts), and sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. (China). All of the experimental live zebrafish
and nude mice were obtained from the Experimental Animal Center of
Dalian Medical University, and the experiments were performed in compliance
with the relevant laws and guidelines. Unless otherwise stated, solvents
and reagents were of analytical grade from commercial suppliers and
were used without further purification.

(Bruker) with chemical shifts reported as ppm (in CHCl3, TMS as an internal standard). Atmospheric pressure ionization (API)
mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6530 QTOF spectrometer. Absorption

4.2 Synthesis
of Probe BIQ
2-(1-H-Benzo[d]imidazol-3-ethyl-2-yl) acetonitrile
and 6-(dimethylamino) quinoline-2-carbaldehyde were prepared according
to published procedures.56,57

2-(1-H-Benzo[d]imidazol-3-ethyl-2-yl) acetonitrile
(0.186 g, 1 mmol) was dissolved into ethanol, followed by the addition
of 6-(dimethylamino) quinoline-2-carbaldehyde (0.200 g, 1 mmol) and
a catalytic amount of piperidine. The reaction mixture was then refluxed
for 3 h to form a dark precipitate. After filtration, rinsing three
times with cool methanol, and vacuum drying, probe BIQ was obtained with 82% yield. 1H NMR (600 MHz, CDCl3): δ (ppm) 8.24 (s, 1H), 8.04 (d, J = 8.8 Hz, 1H), 8.03 (d, J = 7.6 Hz, 1H), 7.81 (d, J = 3.2 Hz, 1H), 7.73 (d, J = 8.4 Hz, 1H),

Mp 176.4–177.9 °C.

4.3 General
Procedure of Spectra Detection
A stock solution of probe BIQ was prepared by dissolving BIQ in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) at a concentration of 0.5
mM. Before spectroscopic measurements, the test solution was freshly
prepared by diluting the stock solution with the corresponding HEPES
buffer solution at a concentration of 10 μM (DMSO/H2O = 3:7, v/v, 20 mM, pH = 7.4). Anions, ROS, and biomolecules (20
mM) were freshly prepared by dissolving the corresponding chemicals
in deionized water. For the spectroscopic analysis of HSO3–, HSO3– at different
concentrations was added into the BIQ solution (total
volume 3 mL). The spectroscopic measurements were performed after
2 min of stabilization. Fluorescence slits are 15 nm, 5 nm at 475
nm emission and 10 nm, 12 nm at 625 nm emission, respectively.

4.4 Quantum Yield Measurement
The relative
fluorescence quantum yields of BIQ before and after reacting
with HSO3– were determined by using fluorescein
as the reference (Φf = 0.85 in 0.1 M NaOH aqueous
solutions). After the measurements of UV–vis and fluorescence
spectra (λex = 460 nm), the quantum yield of the
corresponding compounds were determined using the equation58,59  where Φstd, Fstd, Astd, and ηstd are the quantum yield, integrated fluorescence intensity,
absorbance, and refraction of the standard solution, respectively.
Φunk, Funk, Aunk, and ηunk represent the quantum yield,
integrated fluorescence intensity, absorbance, and refraction of the
sample solution, respectively. All of the spectroscopic measurements
were performed in triplicate and averaged.

4.5 Determination
of HSO3– in Food Samples
White
wine and sugar samples were obtained
from a local supermarket, and the samples were prepared to investigate
the feasibility of probe BIQ for HSO3– detection in real food samples. Specifically, the
white wine sample was prepared by diluting purchased wine with deionized
water into the tenfold diluted test solution, and the sugar sample
solution was prepared by dissolving 6.0 g of sugar in deionized water
and further diluting to 10 mL. After mixing probe BIQ (10 μM) with food samples spiked with HSO3– (0, 26.66, 39.99, 66.65, μM, respectively) for
5 min, the emission intensity at 475 and 625 nm of each sample was
recorded.

4.6 Fluorescence Imaging of HSO3– in Adult Zebrafish
Adult zebrafish were incubated
with an aqueous solution containing probe BIQ (40 μM)
for 5 min, followed by the treatment of HSO3– through oral feeding for another 5 min. Fluorescence images of the
above-treated zebrafish were taken under an Ami Imaging System with
a 465 nm excitation filter and a 630 nm emission filter. Untreated
zebrafish were used as the control group.

4.7 Fluorescence
Imaging of HSO3– in Nude Mice
Nude mice (6 to 8-week-old)
were anesthetized by isoflurane with a flow of oxygen during all of
the experiments. For imaging exogenous HSO3– in live mice, probe BIQ (40 μM, 100 μL)
was injected into the mice legs, followed by the injection of 20 μL
of (4 mM) HSO3– in the same region. Images
on the injection area were recorded every 5 min within 15 min with
a 465 nm excitation filter and a 630 nm emission filter.
