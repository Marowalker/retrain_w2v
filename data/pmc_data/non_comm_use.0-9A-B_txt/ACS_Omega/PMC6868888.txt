Esterification kinetics on acetic acid
with isopropyl alcohol was studied in an intensified fixed bed reactor
at 333–353 K with Amberlyst 36 Wet. The effects of volume flow
rate, molar ratio of reactants, catalyst loading, and operating temperature
were investigated and optimized. The method of UNIFAC was applied
to calculate the activity coefficient of each component for correcting
the nonideality of the solution. Reaction enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs
free energy were calculated in different cases. The pseudohomogeneous
model, Eley–Rideal model, and Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson
model were used to establish kinetic equations of the reaction conducted
in the IFBR. It was proved that the LHHW model can accurately describe
the esterification kinetics in the intensified fixed bed reactor.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Isopropyl acetate (IPAc) is a kind of important fine chemical intermediate,
which is known as the universal solvent. It can be used in high-class
ink oil, pharmaceuticals, pesticide, adhesive, dehydrating agent,
and extractant. IPAc also can be found in fragrance composition.1−3

IPAc can be synthetized
by esterification of acetic acid (HAc) with isopropyl alcohol (IPA)
in the existence of ion exchange resin catalysts. Also, many kinetic
studies on esterification based on ion exchange resin catalysts have
been reported before. Altıokka and Çıtak reported
the kinetic characteristics of the esterification of HAc with isobutanol
by Amberlite IR-120 with the Eley–Rideal(ER) model.4 The same catalyst was used by Osorio-Viana et
al. to study esterification of HAc with isoamyl alcohol.5 The pseudohomogeneous(PH) model, Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson
(LHHW) model, and two other models were applied to describe the reaction
kinetics. Besides, JagadeeshBabu et al. studied esterification kinetics
of HAc with methanol with different kinds of ion exchange catalysts
(Indion 190, Indion 130, and Amberlyst 15 Wet).6 They found that Indion 130 was effective for HAc esterification
and established kinetic equations with the LHHW model by supposing
that the adsorption is slight for each component.

Kinetic studies
reported mostly were conducted in stirred tanks4−8 or traditional fixed bed reactors.9−13 In this work, an intensified fixed bed reactor (IFBR),
improved from the traditional fixed bed reactor by our research group,14 was applied to conduct esterification reactions
of HAc with IPA in the existence of Amberlyst 36 Wet. In the traditional
fixed bed reactor, the reactants flow freely from the top of the bed
through the catalysts without circulation and are then discharged.
However, the IFBR is equipped with a circulating pump to pass the
reactants through the catalyst bed multiple times at a certain flow
rate. Besides, the inner diameter of the fixed bed pipe is smaller
than the traditional one. The linear speed of the fluid is heightened,
and the liquid film is thinner after improvements, which significantly
increases the reaction rate. In this paper, the kinetic equations
based on the IFBR were established by the use of PH, ER, and LHHW
models.

2 Results and
Discussion
2.1 Effects
of Parameters
2.1.1 Effect
of Volume Flow Rate
Experiments on the volume flow rate were
carried out for 5 h at 348.15 K with 15 wt % (percentage of raw material
weight) catalyst loading and an initial HAc/IPA molar ratio of up
to 1.5, the result of which is shown in Figure 1. The result shows that the reaction rate
is increased when the circulating flow rate rises from 20 to 40 mL/min
and then basically unchanged when the circulating flow rate increases
from 40 to 100 mL/min. This indicates that the reaction rate is unaffected
by the external diffusion when the flow rate exceeds 40 mL/min. Chakrabarti
and Sharma15 show that the rate of the
reaction process catalyzed by ion exchange resin will not be controlled
by the external diffusion unless the viscosity of the reactants is
especially high or the speed of agitation (volume flow rate here)
is very low. Therefore, the flow rate should be maintained above 40
mL/min to make certain of the removal of the effects of external diffusion
and enhanced space velocity.

Figure 1 Effect of volume flow rate on conversion
of IPA. Temperature, 348.15 K; initial molar ratio of HAc and IPA,
1.5; catalyst loading, 15 wt %.

2.1.2 Effect of Molar Ratio
To investigate the influence
of molar ratio, the molar ratio of HAc and IPA was changed from 1:1
to 2.5:1, while other reaction conditions remained the same. The experiments
were based on the fact that the total mass of mixture was unchanged.
The result is shown in Figure 2. It is clearly shown that the conversion of IPA goes up from
65.1 to 89.5% as the HAc/IPA molar ratio increases from 1:1 to 2.5:1.
Unchanged total mass means that the concentration of HAc goes up and
that of IPA decreases, which lead to the shift of reaction equilibrium
toward the products.

Figure 2 Effect of molar
ratio HAc/IPA on conversion
of IPA. Temperature, 348.15 K; volume flow rate, 40 mL/min; catalyst
loading, 15 wt %.

2.1.3 Effect of Catalyst Loading
Amberlyst 36 Wet was adopted
to investigate the appropriate catalyst loading and the effect of
that on the conversion of IPA. Catalyst loading was varied from 5
to 25 wt % at 348.15 K with an initial HAc/IPA molar ratio of up to
1.5 and a volume flow rate staying at 40 mL/min. Figure 3 clearly shows that the conversion
of IPA rises from 45.4 to 79.5% with catalyst loading from 5 to 20
wt % at 180 min, while that of IPA only increases from 79.5 to 82.2%
with catalyst loading from 20 to 25 wt %. This indicates a large increase
in the reaction rate as catalyst loading goes up to 20 wt %, which
is attributed to more H+ active centers available. The
reaction rate does not increase much as catalyst loading goes up from
20 to 25 wt %, which means that the number of active centers reaches
saturation. Thus, 20–25 wt % catalyst loading is more suitable
under the reaction conditions.

Figure 3 Effect of catalyst loading on conversion of
IPA. Temperature, 348.15 K; volume flow rate, 40 mL/min; initial molar
ratio of HAc and IPA, 1.5.

2.1.4 Effect of Reaction Temperature
Esterification
equilibrium is closely related to reaction temperature, which can
be further studied by achieving the reaction equilibrium constant
at different temperatures. Experiments on reaction temperature were
conducted from 333.15 to 353.15 K with 25 wt % catalyst loading and
other invariant conditions, the result of which is shown in Figure 4. As shown in the
figure, the reaction rate significantly increases with increasing
reaction temperature, which indicates that the chemical reaction process
is a rate-controlling step.8 In addition,
final conversion of IPA at different temperatures has little difference,
which proves that the reaction temperature has little influence on
the final conversion of IPA. This phenomenon is consistent with the
conclusion obtained below that esterification of IPA with HAc is an
extremely mild exothermic reaction, the heat of reaction of which
is −2.37 kJ/mol.

of IPA. Catalyst loading, 25 wt %; volume flow rate, 40 mL/min; initial
molar ratio of HAc and IPA, 1.5.

2.2 Thermodynamic Parameters
2.2.1 Equilibrium Constant
The equilibrium constant Ka was determined by experiments conducted at
different temperatures ranging from 333.15 to 353.15 K. Considering
the nonideality of the mixed solution, the equilibrium constant was
calculated by activity of each component at equilibrium instead of
concentration. Thus, expression of Ka based
on the activity of components is given in eq 1. 1  where ai, xi, and γi, respectively, are the
activity, mole fraction, and activity coefficient of component i at equilibrium. The mole fraction xi is determined by experiments, and the activity coefficient
is estimated by the UNIFAC model.16 In
the UNIFAC method, the activity coefficient is divided into a combined
part, γi(c), and a residual part, γi(R), which is demonstrated in eq 2. 2  where
the combined part of the activity coefficient γi(c) is calculated by
the volume and area parameters of the groups given in Table S1 (Supporting Information).

The
residual part γi(R) is calculated by the interaction parameters of the groups amn given in Table S2. The specific calculation process is given by Poling et al.16 Calculation results of γi and Ka are listed in Table 1.

Ka	23.315	23.030	22.751	22.451	22.224	
Table 1 gives equilibrium constants
at different temperatures calculated by eq 1. It clearly shows that the value of Ka decreases from 23.315 to 22.224 as the temperature
increases from 333.15 to 353.15 K, which shows that the reaction is
exothermic.

2.2.2 ΔrH0, ΔrS0, and ΔrG0 of Reaction
It is assumed that the
reaction enthalpy ΔrH0 and reaction entropy ΔrS0 are both constants within the experimental temperature range. Thus,
temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant is known from the
chemical reaction isotherm equation (Van’t Hoff equation) and
the definition of Gibbs free energy, which is given in eq 3. 3  Equation 3 obviously shows that ln Ka is linear to 1/T. Therefore, T dependence of Ka is given
in Figure 5 by plotting
ln Ka against 1/T. From
the slope and intercept in the figure, ΔrH0, ΔrS0, and ΔrG0, respectively,
are found to be −2.37 kJ/mol, 19.06 J/(mol·K), and −8.05
kJ/mol (298.15 K).

Figure 5 T dependence of Ka.

However, the actual reaction enthalpy varies
with the temperature. The relationship between the two can be determined
by the Kirchhoff equation 4  where Cp,i represents the molar heat capacity of component i, and νi are stoichiometric
coefficients, which are positive for products and negative for reactants.

The method of Rowlinson–Bondi16 is adopted to get Cp,i, which is shown
in eq 5 5  where Tr = T/Tc, Tr is the contrast
temperature, ω is the acentric factor, Cp0 is the heat capacity of an ideal
gas at a given temperature, and Tc is
the critical temperature.

Tc, Cp0, and ω
are calculated by the method of Constantinou–Gani,16 and then Cp,i is
obtained from eq 5. Cp,i is fitted to the third-order polynomial
with temperature as an independent variable in eq 6. 6  where ai, bi, ci, and di are coefficients, which are given in Table 2.

In addition,
it is known from the Van’t Hoff equation that 7  

The expression of Cp,i is substituted into eqs 4 and 7, and temperature
dependence of ΔrH, ΔrS, ΔrG, and Ka are found to be as follows.17 8   9   10   11  where , , , , and both IK and R·IH are constant terms. Equation 11 can be transformed into eq 12 12  

T dependence of ln Ka – f(T) is given in Figure 6 by plotting ln Ka – f(T) against 1/T. From Figure 6, it can be seen
that 13  where IH = 8.4633 and IK = 5816.47 J/mol. The results obtained from eq 13 are substituted into eqs 8–10, and the
expressions of ΔrH, ΔrS, and ΔrG on the temperature are gained. At 298.15 K, ΔrH0, ΔrS0, and ΔrG0, respectively, are found to be −1.44 kJ/mol, 21.99 J/(mol·K),
and −8.0 kJ/mol.

Figure 6 T dependence of ln Ka – f(T).

Finally, ΔrH0, ΔrS0, and ΔrG0 obtained
by different methods are listed in Table 3, from which it can be found that the results
calculated by different methods have no significant difference in
numerical value.

2.3 Reaction Kinetics
2.3.1 External and Internal Diffusion Significance
According
to the mass transfer theory, heightening the linear speed of the fluid
can improve the turbulence of the fluid and make the liquid film thin
enough that the resistance can be neglected. Thus, the external diffusion
resistance can be reduced and even be small enough to be negligible.18 In the IFBR, the external diffusion is eliminated
by increasing the circulating flow rate above 40 mL/min, which has
been described before.

The effect of internal diffusion can
be evaluated with the Weisz–Prater criterion (Cwp),18 which can be calculated
with eq 14. If Cwp is far less than 1, effects of internal diffusion
on the second-order reaction can be neglected. 14  where ρp is the
density of the catalyst, −robs is
the observed reaction rate, Rc is the
ratio of the volume of catalyst pellet to the external surface area, Cs is the reactant concentration at the catalyst
surface, and De is the effective diffusion
coefficient,19 which is calculated by eq 15. 15  where εp (εp = 0.24
here) is the porosity; τ, calculated by τ = 1/εp, is the tortuosity factor; and DA represents the infinite dilution diffusion coefficient, which is
expressed by the method of Scheibel16 16  where K = 17.5 × 10–8 in the system of HAc and IPA, μ2 is the viscosity of solvent 2, and Vb1 represents the molar volume of solute 1 at its
normal boiling temperature, which is calculated by the formula of
Tyn–Calus.

The Weisz–Prater parameters calculated
at different temperatures are given in Table S3. The values of Cwp are found in the
range of 0.026 at 333.15 K to 0.071 at 353.15 K, which are much less
than 1. This indicates that the influence of internal diffusion can
be negligible in the reaction system.

2.3.2 Kinetic Model
The esterification
of HAc with IPA can be represented by eq 17 17  where kf and kr, respectively, represent apparent rate constants of forward and
reverse reactions. The pseudohomogeneous (PH) model,2,5−7,10 Eley–Rideal (ER) model,2,4,7,10 and
Langmuir–Hinshelwood–Hougen–Watson (LHHW)2,5,7,8,10 model are applied to establish the kinetic
equation of the reaction without external and internal diffusion limitations.

The PH model kinetic equation is given as follows 18  where Mcat represents the mass of catalyst per unit
volume of the reactants, and kr = kf/Ka.

The
ER model supposes that the reactant molecule adsorbed on the active
sites of the catalysts reacts with the other one in bulk solution.
The kinetic equation is given as follows 19  where KIPA and KIPAc, respectively,
are the adsorption equilibrium constants of IPA and the desorption
equilibrium constant of IPAc, kf+ and kr– are the rate constants of forward and
reverse reactions of surface reactions, and kf = kf+KIPA, kr = kr–KIPAc, and Ka = kf/kr.

The LHHW model
assumes that there is only one type of active center on the surface
of the catalyst and HAc and IPA undergo competitive adsorption on
the active center of cation exchange resin. In addition, each molecule
can only be adsorbed on one active center. The surface reaction of
HAc and IPA is a rate-controlled step, and the rest of the diffusion,
adsorption, and desorption processes are in equilibrium. Thus, the
LHHW model can be expressed as follows 20  where KIPA and KHAc are the adsorption
equilibrium constants of IPA and HAc, respectively, KIPAc and KH2O are
the desorption equilibrium constants of IPAc and H2O, and kf = kf+KIPAKHAc and kr = kr–KIPAcKH2O.

Kinetic equations eqs 18–20 are integrated by the method of Runge–Kutta–Fehlberg14,20 with the experimental data. The computational procedure is to minimize
the sum of residual squares (SRS)21 between
the experimental conversion of IPA and the calculated values, which
is shown as follows 21  

The kinetic parameters of
different models calculated in eqs 18–20 are listed in Table 4. RMSE, the square
root of the mean square error,22 is used
to measure the deviation between the experimental values and the calculated
values of the conversion of IPA. It can be seen from Table 4 that the RMSE of the LHHW model
is least in three models at the same temperature, which indicates
that the LHHW model possesses a higher degree of fitting and accuracy.
In addition, the difference between the ER model and the LHHW model
is extremely small, the mean relative error2,23,24 of which, respectively, are 0.40 and 0.37%,
while that of PH model achieves 6.4%. This may indicate that the kinetic
process in the IFBR is more suitable to be described by adsorption
models.

In addition, Figure 7 is obtained by plotting with the experimental conversion
of IPA and the calculated values from the LHHW model, which can strongly
prove the conclusion above. Similarly, figures concerning the ER model
and PH model are given in Figures S1 and S2.

between experimental and calculated conversions with the LHHW model.

T dependence of k can be
known from the Arrhenius expression 22  which can be changed into 23  where A0 represents the pre-exponential
factor, and Ea is the activation energy.
The kinetic data of the LHHW model are brought into eq 23 by plotting ln k against 1/T. T dependence of k is given in Figure 8, and calculated A0 and Ea are given in Table 5.

Based on A0 and Ea in Table 5, the expressions of forward and reverse
reactions are found to be 24   25  

The activation energy
for esterification of HAc with IPA catalyzed by Amberlyst 15 in a
stirred tank was found to be 60.0 kJ/mol by Ali and Merchant.25 The similar result, 68.62 kJ/mol, was obtained
by Manning26 with the LHHW model. These
results are not far from the conclusions in this study.

3 Conclusions
Esterification
kinetics of HAc with IPA was studied with Amberlyst 36 Wet in an IFBR
at 333–353 K. Effects of different reaction conditions were
investigated. ΔrH0, ΔrS0, and ΔrG0, respectively, were found to be −2.37
kJ/mol, 19.06 J/(mol·K), and −8.05 kJ/mol (298.15 K) when
ΔrH0 was the constant
value. The effect of internal diffusion was evaluated by the Weisz–Prater
criterion, which was found to be negligible. Three kinds of kinetic
models were used to describe the esterification kinetics of HAc with
IPA, the results of which showed that adsorption models, especially
the LHHW model, were more suitable to explain the esterification reaction
process conducted in the IFBR. This provides guidance for industrialized
production of IPAc in the fixed bed reactor.

glass flask, a high-temperature circulator (298–373 K), a peristaltic
pump (<720 mL/min), and a stainless steel fixed bed (1 cm inner
diameter and 30 cm height). The three-necked glass flask and fixed
bed reactor were specially made and both equipped with jackets with
the corresponding material for the water bath. The peristaltic pump
was obtained from Baoding Lead Fluid Technology Co., LTD, for precise
control of raw material flow. The high-temperature circulator was

Figure 9 Process diagram of IFBR.

4.3 Procedure
The fresh catalyst was
cleaned with deionized water until the supernatant became achromatic
before use. Then, the washed catalyst was soaked in isopropyl alcohol
for 24 h, filtered, and dried at 358 K. The prescribed amount of dried
catalyst was filled into the fixed bed reactor. HAc and IPA were added
to the 250 mL three-necked glass flask according to a desired molar
ratio, then preheated to the experiment temperature, and stirred with
a magnetic stirrer at the same time. The peristaltic pump was opened
when the mixture temperature increased to the specified value. Reaction
time was recorded at the moment when the mixture entered the fixed
bed. Samples were taken from one neck of the flask for gas chromatography
analysis at regular intervals after the experiment began.

detector.
The temperature of the injection port and detector was set to 240
°C, and the injection volume was 0.5 μL. The column temperature
was programmed with 40 °C and initially kept for 4 min, followed
by 10 °C·min–1 rising to 80 °C, which
was held for 1 min.
