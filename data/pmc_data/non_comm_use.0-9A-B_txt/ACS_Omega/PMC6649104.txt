Novel LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 nanocomposites
are synthesized by co-precipitation method for photocatalytic degradation
of Rhodamine B (RhB) and p-chlorophenol under visible
light irradiation. Heterostructures between LaFeO3 and
Ag2CO3 semiconductors are formed during the
synthesis of these nanocomposites. Among the nanocomposites prepared
with different ratios of LaFeO3 and Ag2CO3, 1% LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 shows
the highest photocatalytic activity for the degradation of RhB. Maximum
electron–hole pair decoupling efficiency is observed in 1%
LaFeO3/Ag2CO3, which causes the greater
activity of the heterostructure. Degradation efficiency of 99.5% for
RhB and 59% for p-chlorophenol has been obtained
under natural sunlight within 45 min. Interestingly, the stability
of Ag2CO3 is improved dramatically after making
nanocomposite, and no decomposition of the catalyst was observed even
after several photocatalytic cycles. Reactive oxygen species scavenging
experiments with p-benzoquinone, isopropyl alcohol,
and ammonium oxalate suggest that a major degradation process is caused
by holes. Degradation of RhB into small organic moieties is detected
using LC–MS technique. Further, the efficient mineralization
of the degradation products occurs during the catalytic process.

1 Introduction
Visible-light-driven photocatalysis has achieved extensive attention
since Fujishima and Honda discovered the phenomenon of photoelectrochemical
reactions over titania electrode.1 Subsequently,
this discovery found applications in many fields, such as photocatalytic
energy generation and decontamination of air and water. Because energy
and the environment have great importance for the sustenance of humankind,
heterogeneous photocatalysis has garnered the attention of various
researchers. So far, many technologies, including physical, chemical,
and biological treatments, have been employed for the removal of organic
pollutants. Among all techniques, heterogeneous photocatalysis is
regarded as one of the promising technologies owing to its low cost,
being eco-friendly, and sustainability.2 As a step forward, semiconductor-based photocatalysis was primarily
into focus to decontaminate water by photocatalytic degradation of
dyes, pesticides, and other organic effluents.3

The semiconductor photocatalyst on exposure of light generates
electron–hole pairs in the conduction band (CB) and valence
band (VB), respectively.4 Separation of
these charge carriers produces redox centers at VB and CB, which generate
reactive oxygen species (ROS) to degrade the organic pollutants. However,
the simultaneous recombination of the electron–hole pairs leads
to the photocorrosion of the photocatalyst, which decreases the catalytic
performance. Moreover, the large band gap semiconductors are not desirable
as they show response only in the UV light, which is less abundant
in the sunlight. In this respect, researchers used various methods
to enhance the visible light response of semiconductor photocatalysts
and also to mitigate the charge carrier recombination. The various
advancements include metal and nonmetal ion doping,5−7 heterostructure
formation,8,9 polymer-based nanocomposites,10 metal–organic frameworks,11 liquid metal/metal oxide frameworks,12 and introduction of other visible light responsive
moieties, namely, graphene oxide,13,14 carbon nitride,15,16 melamine,17 quantum dots,18−20 PbMoO4,21 Ga2O3,22 and so forth.

Ag-based
photocatalysts show good photocatalytic performance because
of the strong surface plasmon resonance effect of Ag nanoparticles
produced on the surface.23 Silver carbonate
(Ag2CO3) is a visible-light-driven photocatalyst
with a band gap of ∼2.7 eV. It exhibits high photocatalytic
capability for degradation of organic pollutants.24,25 However, the undesirable photocorrosion leads to poor photostability
and weak photocatalytic performance. Hence, photostability is a grave
issue with almost all reported silver-based photocatalysts.26,27 When exposed to visible light, Ag+ would be reduced to
metallic silver (Ag0) because of the strong reduction potential
of photoinduced electrons.28 Hence, the
photocatalytic performance of such catalysts seriously decreases on
recycling because of the partial loss of the catalyst. Therefore,
various strategies were employed to address this limitation. Construction
of the heterostructure with two semiconductors is proven to be one
of the most effective strategies to enhance the stability and subsequent
photocatalytic performance. By now, a large number of composite materials
are synthesized, such as Ag3PO4/BiFeO3,29 AgCl/Ag2CO3,30 Ag2CO3/Ag2O,31 Ag3PO4/AgI,32 g-C3N4/Ag2CO3,33 BiVO4/Ag/Ag2CO3,34 Ag2CrO4/LaFeO3,35 and
so forth. The heterojunction influences the charge transfer properties,
such as transfer pathway, transfer direction, separation, and recombination
efficiencies of photoinduced charge carriers.36,37 The abovementioned characteristics influence the photocatalytic
performance and stability. In this respect, it was thought that, by
making a heterostructure with a perovskite metal ferrite, the stability
and activity of Ag2CO3 may be increased.38 LaFeO3 is a p-type narrow band gap
semiconductor and is a potential visible-light-driven photocatalyst.39,40 So, here in this work, we have successfully synthesized novel LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 heterostructure photocatalysts
for the degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) dye and p-chlorophenol. Photocatalytic activity of these materials has been
studied under both xenon lamp and sunlight irradiation. ROS responsible
for the photocatalytic activity are identified. The stability and
activity of these photocatalysts are studied in successive cycles
of reuse.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 XRD Studies
XRD patterns of pure
LFO, Ag2CO3, and their nanocomposites are recorded
and shown in Figure 1. In the case of Ag2CO3, characteristic peaks
can be observed at 2θ values of 18.55 (020), 20.54 (110), 32.66
(−101), 33.67 (130), 37.12 (200), and 39.67° (031).27 It is matched with the JCPDS file PDF 00-001-1071.
Similarly, LFO shows peaks at 2θ values of 22.61 (101), 32.19
(121), 39.67 (220), 46.14 (202), and 57.40° (240).39 The values matched with the JCPDS file PDF 00-037-1493.
The composite samples contain peaks from both LFO and Ag2CO3. Also, the main peak of LFO at 2θ value of 32.190°
(121) grows with increasing amount of LFO in the nanocomposites. The
crystallite size of the pure samples and the composites was determined
on the basis of Scherrer equation using the main characteristic peaks.
The average crystallite sizes obtained are presented in Table 1. The average crystallite size
of Ag2CO3 decreases with the increase in the
amount of LFO. The decrease in the crystallite size can be attributed
to the dissimilar boundaries provided by the LFO nanoparticles, which
inhibit the crystal growth.41−43

their nanocomposites.

2.2 Microscopic Studies
2.2.1 SEM
SEM images of Ag2CO3, LFO, and 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite
are shown in Figure 2. Uniform small rod-shaped Ag2CO3 nanoparticles
are observed with an average diameter of 500 nm (Figure 2a). For LFO, small granular
particles are observed (Figure 2b). In the case of the nanocomposite sample, small LFO particles
are found uniformly on the surface of rod-shaped Ag2CO3 (Figure 2c,d).
This indicates the proximity and nanocomposite formation between the
two phases.

(c,d) the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite.

2.2.2 TEM
TEM micrographs of the pure
Ag2CO3, LFO, and 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 samples are recorded and presented in Figure 3. The rod-shaped Ag2CO3 particles with an average diameter of ∼500nm are observed
(Figure 3a). LFO particles
are granular with a particle size of 40–70 nm (Figure 3b). In the case of the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite sample, rough-surfaced rods of
Ag2CO3 decorated with LFO particles are observed
(Figure 3c,d). This
indicates that the two phases are in proximity and the heterostructure
is formed. The HRTEM image of the composite materials shows the reflections
from both phases (Figure 3e). The interplanar spacing d = 4.32 Å
corresponds to the reflection from (110) plane of Ag2CO3, whereas d = 2.77 Å corresponds to
the (121) plane of LFO. The SAED pattern also exhibited the reflections
for both phases (Figure 3f). The diffraction spots at interplanar spacing d = 2.74 Å correspond to the (−101) plane of Ag2CO3 phase, whereas d = 1.96 Å corresponds
to the (202) plane of LFO. These results further confirm the heterostructure
formation between Ag2CO3 and LFO.

LFO, and (c,d) 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 composite; (e,f)

2.2.3 EDS
Mapping
To check the uniform
distribution of the elements, EDS mapping of the nanocomposite sample
was recorded and is presented in Figure 4. It can be seen from the elemental distribution
that all the elements are uniformly distributed in the nanocomposite
material.

2.3 Photocatalytic
Studies
The photocatalytic
performance of these nanomaterials for the degradation of RhB molecules
in the presence of visible light is investigated, and the results
are shown in Figure 5a–c. The overlay absorption spectra of RhB degradation for
the various samples are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). The absorption spectra of RhB solution
during the photocatalytic experiment at different time intervals in
the presence of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 photocatalyst
are shown in Figure 5a. In the control experiments, that is, in the absence of the photocatalyst,
no degradation of RhB takes place (Figure 5b). The catalytic degradation is negligible
in the dark, suggesting that exclusive photocatalytic reaction mechanism
has taken place.

Figure 5 Kinetics of photocatalytic decolorization of RhB in the
presence
of pure Ag2CO3, LFO, and LFO/Ag2CO3 heterostructures. (a) Change in absorption of RhB at regular
intervals of light irradiation in the presence of the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 photocatalyst, (b) change in concentration
(Ct/C0), and
(c) ln(C0/Ct) versus irradiation time of RhB during its decolorization in the
presence of Ag2CO3, LFO, and LFO/Ag2CO3 heterostructures.

The percentage of degradation and the apparent rate constant
(Kapp) for various catalysts are given
in Table 2. The degradation
rate of RhB in 45 min is the highest for 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 sample (Figure 5b) and is 98.8%, which is about 4.2 and 1.15 times greater than those
of LFO (23.87%) and Ag2CO3 (87.15%). Figure 5c shows that the
degradation process follows the first-order kinetic equation. The
1% LFO/Ag2CO3 photocatalyst exhibits maximum
photodegradation efficiency, and the kapp of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 is 0.062 min–1, which is 19.0 and 2.0 times higher than those of LFO (0.004 min–1) and Ag2CO3 (0.032 min–1), respectively. This suggests that the nanocomposite
shows a very high synergistic effect in photocatalysis, which may
be due to the efficient decoupling of electron–hole pairs in
these composites.44

Natural-sunlight-driven
experiments are performed with the best
achieved photocatalyst (1% LFO/Ag2CO3) to assure
the economical and broader viability of this photocatalyst. The absorption
spectra for RhB and p-chlorophenol under sunlight
at different time intervals are presented in the Supporting Information (Figure S2). It is found that the nanocomposite
shows excellent photocatalytic activity even under natural sunlight
and RhB degradation efficiency is 99.5% (Figure 6a). In sunlight, the kapp obtained for the RhB degradation is 0.064 min–1. The overwhelming activity under the sunlight irradiation
can be attributed to the small portion of the UV light in sunlight,
where the heterostructured material has higher absorption. To confirm
the role of UV light, RhB degradation is studied under xenon lamp
without any cut on filter. It shows that there is a significant increase
in the catalytic activity as can be seen in Figure 6a,b, and the kapp is found to be 0.108 min–1 with 99.8% degradation
in 45 min (Table 2).
This heterostucture is also used for the degradation of p-chlorophenol under natural sunlight, and it shows a very good activity
with 59% degradation as can be seen in Figure 6c,d. The kapp obtained for p-chlorophenol degradation is 0.033
min–1.

and (d) ln(C0/Ct) versus irradiation time for p-chlorophenol degradation.

2.4 Recyclability
and Stability
Besides
the efficiency, the stability and durability of the photocatalysts
are also indispensable. To evaluate the stability of the pure Ag2CO3 and 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 photocatalysts,
these catalysts are subjected to recycling, and the results are shown
in Figure 7. The catalytic
activity of Ag2CO3 decreases with the increase
in the number of cycles (Figure 7a), whereas the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite sample exhibited excellent catalytic activity even
after four cycles of reuse (Figure 7b). To check the stability of the photocatalysts after
repetitive use, XRD patterns of the photocatalysts are recorded and
shown in Figure 8.
It can be observed from the XRD patterns that there is significant
accumulation of Ag0 (2θ = 38.119) in the case of
pure Ag2CO3 photocatalyst on repetitive use.
However, in the case of the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite,
there is no accumulation of Ag0, which shows that the nanocomposite
photocatalyst is highly stable against photocorrosion during the photocatalytic
process.

(b) 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 in successive cycles of reuse.

Figure 8 XRD patterns of the Ag2CO3 and the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite (before
the photocatalytic reaction
and after the 4th cycle of the reaction).

2.5 Role of ROS
The ROS scavenging experiments
with different scavengers are performed to find out the most dominant
species responsible for the photocatalytic degradation of RhB under
the visible light irradiation over 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite. ROS species, such as superoxide radical anions (O2–·), hydroxyl
radicals (OH·), and the hole (h+), are
known to have a role in the photocatalytic dye degradation processes.
The fate and the role of ROS are investigated using radical and hole
trapping experiments, and the results are presented in Figure 9. Different scavengers, namely, p-benzoquinone (BQ) as O2–· scavenger, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) as OH· scavenger, and ammonium oxalate (AO) as the hole scavenger,
are used for this purpose. The degradation of RhB is decreased significantly
by adding AO in the RhB solution which indicates that the holes are
the most dominant species in the degradation process. The similar
experiments with IPA and BQ followed that the OH· radicals
are less responsible than the holes for the degradation process, whereas
O2–· has
the least role. The generation of OH· radicals during
the photocatalytic process by 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 sample
is determined by the terephthalic acid oxidation method. The emission
intensity of dihydroxyterephthalic acid is the direct measure of the
OH· concentrations.45 The
PL spectra of the terephthalic acid solution after being illuminated
under the visible light for 45 min with 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). The substantial increase in the emission intensities
with irradiation time indicates the gradual generation of OH· by 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite during the
photocatalytic process.

reaction at different
time intervals in the presence of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 photocatalyst and (a) BQ, (b) IPA, (c) AO. (d) kapp of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 for the degradation
of RhB in the presence of various ROS scavengers.

2.6 EIS and Transient Photocurrent Studies
To understand the enhanced photocatalytic activity with the composite
material, the decoupling efficiency of the photogenerated electron–hole
pairs across the interface in the semiconductor photocatalyst needs
to be addressed. For this purpose, EIS Nyquist plots are explored.46,47 EIS Nyquist plots of LFO, Ag2CO3, and 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 under the visible light irradiation are presented
in Figure 10a. The
arc radius of the EIS Nyquist plot of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 was smaller than those of the pure samples. These results
suggest that more efficient charge carrier separation and faster interfacial
charge transfer occurs on the nanocomposite when compared to pure
LFO and Ag2CO3 photocatalysts.48,49

Figure 10 (a) EIS Nyquist plots and (b) photocurrent measurements of the
pure LFO, Ag2CO3, and 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 samples

The transient photocurrent
response for the LFO, Ag2CO3, and 1%LFO/Ag2CO3 samples is
recorded up to four on–off cycles with a holding time of 30
s each, under xenon lamp illumination (Figure 10b). The photocurrent density obtained in
the presence of light is approximately 4.0, 6.0, and 9.5 μA
cm–2 for LFO, Ag2CO3, and
1% LFO/Ag2CO3, respectively. The current drops
drastically when light is off and reproduces again when the light
is on. It is found that LFO is having a stable response in comparison
to Ag2CO3, which exhibits a drop in the photocurrent
response in the successive cycles. However, the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite shows the highest photocurrent response
with stability. From these results, it can be suggested that the heterostructure
formation has led to the decrease in recombination of the charge carriers
and also enhanced the charge carrier efficiency.35

2.7 Optical Properties
Light absorption
properties of the pure and nanocomposite materials are studied using
UV–vis DRS, and the spectra are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11a shows that the DRS spectra of all the
nanocomposite samples are red-shifted because of the addition of lower
band gap LFO. Figure 11b presents the Kubelka–Munk plots of LFO, Ag2CO3, and the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite.
The measured band gaps are 2.45, 2.84, and 2.62 eV for pure LFO, pure
Ag2CO3, and the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite, respectively.

Figure 11 (a) DRS spectra of LFO,
Ag2CO3, and the 1%
LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposites. (b) Band gap calculation
of LFO, Ag2CO3, and the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite.

The band gap of these materials is calculated using the formula50 1  as α is proportional
to Kubelka–Munk function F(R), the equation
can be modified as 2  where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function, v is the
light frequency, Eg is the band gap energy,
and A is the proportionality constant. The value
of n is determined according to the type of optical
transition (for direct transition, n = 1; for indirect
transition, n = 4).50 The
value of n for Ag2CO3 and LFO
is 4 and 1, respectively, as the former has an indirect band gap and
the latter has a direct band gap. The Eg of Ag2CO3 was measured from the plot of [F(R)·hv]1/2 versus hv and is found to be 2.84 eV. Accordingly, the Eg of LFO was determined from the plot of [F(R)·hv]2 versus hv and is found to be 2.45 eV (Figure 11b).

The VB edge position of 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 nanocomposite
at the point of zero charge is calculated using the following empirical
equation51,52 3  where EVB is the VB edge potential, X is the geometric
mean of the electronegativity of the constituent elements of the semiconductor,
and Ec is the free electron energy on
hydrogen’s scale (4.5 eV). Values of X for
Ag2CO3 and LFO are ca. 6.02 and 5.70 eV, respectively.27,39 The calculated EVB of Ag2CO3 and LFO are 2.94 and 2.43 eV/NHE, respectively. The
CB edge potential ECB is calculated by: 4  

The estimated ECB for Ag2CO3 and LFO are 0.10 and
−0.03 eV/NHE, respectively.

2.8 Band
Gap Structures and the Possible Degradation
Mechanism
The band edge positions of the LFO and Ag2CO3 are estimated as discussed above. The results show
that the LFO and Ag2CO3 form a composite heterostructure,
which is favorable for the charge separation. The VB and CB edge potentials
of LFO and Ag2CO3 are suitable for electron–hole
pair separation and their transfer across the interface of the heterostructure.
The Fermi level (EF) of n-type Ag2CO3 is near the CB, and the EF of p-type LFO is close to its VB. When these two semiconductors
get into contact, there is realignment of the Fermi levels, which
leads to the heterostructure formation.53

On the basis of band positions, photocatalytic activity, stability,
and other experimental results on composite materials, a possible
mechanism is elucidated and shown in Figure 12. Upon shining light, electron–hole
pairs are generated in both Ag2CO3 and LFO semiconductors.
These photogenerated charge carriers would be separated efficiently
through a Z-scheme mechanism, and this mechanism might be responsible
for the increase in stability of the LFO/ Ag2CO3 nanocomposite. The holes on the VB of Ag2CO3 have sufficient potential to oxidize OH– into
OH· radical. The CB potential of LFO is −0.02
eV versus NHE, which is much positive than the reduction potential
of O2(aq)/O2–· (−0.33eV vs NHE). Thus, there is a least
chance of O2–· generation.54 However, it has sufficient potential for the
peroxide formation (O2/H2O2) (0.685
eV vs NHE) and hence generates H2O2, which eventually
form HO· radical by single electron reduction. At
the same time, photogenerated electrons in the CB of Ag2CO3 may cause reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+, and these Fe2+ ions participate in the Fenton reaction.35,55 This is a cyclic process and is more favorable in generation of
OH· from H2O2. Hence, the holes
at the VB of Ag2CO3 and the OH· radical generated from the electrons at the CB of LFO are the most
dominant species in this process of photodegradation. This is also
confirmed by the ROS scavenging experiments.

and the Z-scheme mechanism for the generation
of different ROS.

2.9 LC–MS
Study
LC–MS analysis
was carried out to trace the degradation pathway of the RhB dye. The
mass spectrograms of the degradation products at different irradiation
times are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S4). The ROS produced, namely, OH· and
the hole, might attack the central carbon of RhB to degrade it via
N-de-ethylation process. As it is evident from the mass spectra, the
main intermediates have m/z values
of 443, 415, and 387. These m/z values
correspond to RhB (443), N,N-diethyl-N′-ethylrhodamine (415), N,N-diethylrhodamine, and N-ethyl-N′-ethylrhodamine (387). These intermediates further
undergo complete de-ethylation and degrade to the intermediate with m/z value of 331. This intermediate undergoes
ring opening and subsequent hydroxylation to generate simpler compounds.
The major component has m/z value
of 74 and corresponds to propionic acid. These results are in agreement
with previous reports on the degradation of RhB dye56−58 in the presence
of various light sources. Hence, a fragmentation pathway can be proposed
for photocatalytic degradation of RhB dye by the LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 photocatalysts, as shown in the Supporting Information (Scheme S1). These oxidized
products eventually get mineralized into CO2, H2O, NO3–, and NH4+.59

2.10 Chemical
Oxygen Demand (COD) Removal Efficiency
To investigate the
mineralization of organic pollutants in the
photocatalytic oxidation, the COD removal during the photocatalytic
reaction is measured using the acidic dichromate method with a Bioblock
COD analyzer for the 1% LFO/Ag2CO3 sample.60 The decrease in the COD value indicates the
degree of mineralization of the organic species. The COD value decreases
continuously as a function of irradiation time (Figure S5). After 45 min of light irradiation, the COD is
reduced to 92% of the initial value. It indicates that the RhB molecules
are eventually degraded into CO2 and H2O.

3 Conclusions
LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 nanocomposites with
different ratios of LaFeO3 and Ag2CO3 are successfully synthesized by in situ co-precipitation method.
The heterostructure formation in nanocomposites leads to the improved
photocatalytic properties because of the efficient decoupling of the
charge carriers and increased charge transfer. Holes play the most
dominant role, followed by hydroxyl radicals, in the degradation of
RhB. Among all nanocomposites, 1 wt % LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 exhibits the highest photocatalytic activity with
improved stability during the photocatalytic process. The composite
is stable after various cycles of photocatalysis without losing the
catalytic activity. This nanocomposite acts as an excellent photocatalyst
for the degradation of RhB dye with 99.5% efficiency in 45 min under
natural sunlight irradiation. Further, efficient mineralization of
the degradation products is observed. These results give hope for
future application of this material in photocatalytic degradation
of various organic pollutants present in polluted water under natural
sunlight. Hence, this nanocomposite may be well exploited for the
remediation of the polluted water under natural sunlight on a large
scale.

4.1 Synthesis of the Photocatalysts
4.1.1 Synthesis of LaFeO3 Nanoparticles
Pure phase
LaFeO3 was synthesized by citric acid sol–gel
method.39,40 Typically, 5 mmol of La(NO3)3·6H2O and 5 mmol of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O were dissolved in 30 mL of deionized
H2O in the presence of 10 mmol of citric acid as the complexing
agent. The mixture was stirred at 70 °C for 24 h, and a gel was
obtained. The gel was dried in an oven at 100 °C until a dry
xerogel was obtained. The amorphous mass was calcined at 500 °C
for 3 h and then at 700 °C for another 3 h with a heating rate
of 300 °C h–1. The compound was put on natural
cooling and then crushed and used for further characterization.

4.1.2 Synthesis of Ag2CO3 Nanorods
Ag2CO3 was synthesized by
the co-precipitation method.27 Primarily,
2.5 mmol of NaHCO3 was dissolved in 30 mL of deionized
water to obtain a clear solution. To this solution, a 20 mL of another
solution was added dropwise containing 5 mmol of AgNO3.
The reaction setup was put in an ice bath in the dark to yield rod-shaped
Ag2CO3 structures.

4.1.3 Synthesis
of LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 Nanocomposite
The LaFeO3/Ag2CO3 nanocomposites
were synthesized by the in situ
co-precipitation method. A definite amount of LaFeO3 nanoparticles
was dispersed in 30 mL of deionized H2O under ultrasonication
followed by vigorous stirring for 1 h. Then, 2.5 mmol of NaHCO3 dissolved in 10 mL of DI water was added dropwise, and stirring
was continued for 2 more hours. Finally, 5 mmol of AgNO3 dissolved in 10 mL of DI water was added in the dark, and the mixture
was stirred for 12 h in an ice bath to allow the gradual synthesis
of the nanocomposites. The as-obtained compound was centrifuged, washed,
and dried in a vacuum oven at 60 °C. Different percentages of
LFO were chosen to obtain a series of samples. The obtained samples
were designated as 0.5% LFO/Ag2CO3, 1% LFO/Ag2CO3, 5% LFO/Ag2CO3, 10% LFO/Ag2CO3, and 20% LFO/Ag2CO3.

4.2 Characterization
XRD patterns were
investigated using a Bruker D8 X-ray diffractometer equipped with
Cu Kα irradiation. SEM (JEOL9003) and TEM (JEOL2100) were used
to obtain the morphology and particle size. HRTEM and SAED were used
to confirm the formation of the heterostructure. EDS was done to confirm
the elements present, and EDS mapping was done to observe the elemental
distribution. UV–vis DRS (UV-2600 Spectrophotometer, Shimadzu)
was used to obtain the absorption spectra of different samples and
subsequent band gap calculation by using Kubelka–Munk function.
Metrohm Autolab RRDE/RDE-2 was used to obtain EIS spectra and transient
photocurrent to analyze the charge transfer property and electron–hole
recombination using Nyquist plots. HPLC–MS was employed to
analyze the degradation products of the RhB. COD analyzer (Lovibond,
RD 125) was also employed to confirm the mineralization of the degradation
products.

4.3 Photocatalytic Experiments
The photocatalytic
activity of the photocatalysts was assessed by the degradation of
RhB and p-chlorophenol under the influence of the
visible light and natural sunlight irradiation. A 450 W xenon lamp
(Newport) operated at 400 W with 395 nm filter was used to carry out
the visible light irradiations. A 12 cm liquid water filter was used
to cut the IR light. However, the sunlight irradiations were applied
at noon during the month of April at INST, Mohali, Punjab. A 10 μM
solution of the RhB dye (80 mL), containing the desired quantity of
the photocatalyst (1 g L–1), was taken in a Pyrex
glass reactor and was stirred with a magnetic stirrer. Atmospheric
oxygen was continuously passed into the solution throughout the experiment.
For the first 20 min, the solution was stirred in the dark to attain
adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the dye solution
and the photocatalyst. Subsequently, the first sample (at 0 min) was
taken out, and then, the light irradiation was started. During the
irradiation, samples of 2 mL each were collected at constant time
intervals. The collected samples were centrifuged, and the supernatants
were subsequently analyzed using UV–vis spectroscopy. The absorbance
of the dye aliquots was monitored at its λmax (554
nm) as a function of irradiation time. The dye concentrations at different
time intervals of the irradiation were acquired from the standard
calibration curve, which was obtained by the absorbance of the dye
at various known concentrations.52 Similar
procedure was applied for p-chlorophenol degradation,
where the aliquots were monitored at its λmax (225nm)
as a function of irradiation time.

The consistency and the stability
of the photocatalysts were analyzed by the recycling experiments.
After every cycle of the experiment, the photocatalyst was separated
from the photoreactor and the aliquots by centrifugation. The photocatalyst
was repeatedly washed with distilled water and ethanol. Finally, these
samples were dried at 50 °C for 12 h and reused for the next
cycle of the photocatalysis experiment.

The degradation efficiency
(%) by the photocatalyst follows the
equation 5  where C0 is the initial concentration of the dye and C is the concentration of RhB at different irradiation times.
The
first-order kinetic equation, which can be applied to explain the
photocatalytic degradation, according to Langmuir–Hinshelwood
kinetic model, is as follows61 6  where C0 is the initial
concentration of the dye solution and Ct is the concentration of dye at irradiation
time t. kapp is the apparent
first-order rate constant (min–1) for the reaction.
