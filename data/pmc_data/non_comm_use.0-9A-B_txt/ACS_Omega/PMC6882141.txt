We
herein provide quantitative measures of sensors’ reliability
and sensitivity as a function of the sensor’s capacity (maximum detection signal
or saturation state) in addition to other adsorption–desorption
parameters that define the detection signals toward volatile organic
compounds (VOCs). The measures we have developed show differentiation
between irregular dispersed points of sensors with low and high capacities.
We show that the sharpest capacity that separates between the two
types of distribution points, viz the reliability limit (RL), is tightly
linked with the desorption constant kd. Less sharp RLs give interpretations of other reliability indicators.
RL also provides information about the reliability of detecting signals
of VOCs for a given sensor and sensors for a particular VOC. We show
that sensors with high capacities are more reliable and sensitive
to detecting signals of VOCs than sensors with lower capacities.

Introduction
Sensors based on monolayer-capped gold
nanoparticles (GNPs) have
the advantage of low detection limits for volatile organic compounds
(VOCs), a wide dynamic range, ambient room operation, tolerance for
varying humidity levels as in the case of exhaled breath, reasonable
dimensions, and low cost.1−6 These advantages could be attributed to the fact that the chemical
and physical properties of monolayer-capped GNPs can be accurately
tailored to obtain the desired sensitivity and selectivity for a particular
sensing application.1,6−16 On this account, these advantages grant control over the interparticle
distance and make it possible to obtain nearly uniform composite films.

The most common configuration of monolayer-capped GNP sensors for
breath analysis is based on a chemiresistor platform.6,10,17,18 Production of these sensors relies on the assembly of thin films
of monolayer-capped GNPs between adjacent micro-electrodes. In the
monolayer-capped GNP chemiresistive films, the sorption of VOCs is
achieved by the organic film component, and the electric conductivity
is achieved by GNPs.6,11,19−21 On exposure to gas samples, VOCs reach the sensing
surface or diffuse into the sensing film and react with the capping
ligands/functional groups, causing shrinkage/expansion in the volume
of the nanomaterial film. Consequently, the steric position of the
inorganic nanomaterial blocks shifts, producing an increase or decrease
in film resistance. In other instances, exposure of the nanomaterial
film to VOCs with high dielectric constants leads to a charge transfer
due to changes in the dielectric constants of the medium surrounding
the nanoparticles, leading to a decrease in the measured resistance
of the monolayer-capped GNP film.9,22,23

A critical factor in the determination of the
monolayer-capped
GNP sensing characteristics relies on how VOCs interact with the GNP
films, viz. on the adsorption–desorption (AD) kinetics. Several
studies have reported on theoretical models based on first-order kinetics
of VOCs with the immobilized ligands on the sensor’s surface.24−27 In one theoretical model, the equation of the rate reaction for
a single analyte could successfully be extended to account for an n VOCs mixture, assuming a single adsorbate molecule on
one binding site.26 Another theoretical
model for evaluation of the AD noise in the microfluidic structure
with biosensors operating in an n analytes environment
could account for small fluctuations as a random process in the detection
signal around the equilibrium.27 To improve
the GNP sensors and to enable quantitative measures for their reliability
and sensitivity, a better and more comprehensive understanding of
AD parameters is required.

In this article, we have modified
the desorption rate constant
of the existing reaction model24−28 and applied it to derive AD parameters through its fit to the experimental
data. Using this model, we demonstrate the impact of the AD parameters
and input data on the function of the sensors and their practical
implications. We achieve these findings from two datasets. One dataset
was obtained from experiments carried out in this study, and the other
one was based on an existing study. Our results show that the AD parameters
give quantitative measures of sensors’ reliability and sensitivity
and can be extended for an n VOCs mixture, assuming
a single VOC molecule per binding site.26

Results
Theoretical Considerations
The flux balance equation
of AD of a single analyte on a sensor surface during the pulse time tp is24,30 1  where θ is the fraction of bounded sites
on a sensor’s surface, t is the time, ka′ is the adsorption rate constant, C is the analyte
concentration adjacent to the sensor’s surface, and kd,a is the desorption rate constant during the
adsorption stage within 0 < t ≤ tp. For t > tp, the desorption rate equation is derived from eq 1 for C = 0 1a  

The desorption
rate constant kd in eq 1a should be equal to or >kd,a in eq 1 because the desorption
for t > tp is undisturbed
by adsorption. Therefore, it is expected that, in general, kd ≥ kd,a.

We consider the case of a step function of the inlet concentration C0. In this case, the impulse within 0 ≤ t ≤ tp yields constant
bulk concentration. Thus, we may replace ka′·C in eq 1 with ka·C0, in which ka = ka′·C/C0 is an apparent adsorption rate constant. This
replacement turns the bounded sites fraction θa at
the adsorption stage in eq 1 into 2  

Applying the initial condition θa = 0 at t = 0 to eq 2 yields θa(t) as in eq 3 3  

For t > tp, the adsorption
process stops. Therefore, eqs 1, 2, and 3 vanish
and eq 1a governs the
free desorption, that is, desorption without disturbance by the adsorption.
Using the initial condition θp = θa(tp) from eq 3, the solution of eq 1a yields 4  

It is worth noting that in previous
studies,24,28kd was assumed
equal in both adsorption
stage and free desorption. Desorption of VOCs during the adsorption
stage should, in general, be slower than the free desorption after
adsorption ends. Therefore, following the present fit of the model
to 2 data sets and the fit therein,28 support
the assumption of kd,a ≤ kd depends on sensors and data characteristics.

Sensor’s Capacity
Our
typical raw data of each
sensor described in the Experimental Section is shown in Figure 1. A sensor’s response, viz the change in the measured electrical
resistance of the GNP-based chemiresistor upon exposure to analyte
(or VOC), starts at the basic resistance of Rb without analytes or θ = 0. Adsorption endures from t = 0 to tp or from θ
= 0 to θp, and the resistance changes from Rb to Rp, respectively.
After several minutes of free desorption, the sensor was fed continuously
with analytes until it reached its saturation level with Rsat as a maximum resistance or θ = 1.

Figure 1 Typical detection
signal followed by saturation measurements of
sensors indicating analyte capacity. Definitions of main resistances
of a sensor in response to its exposure to analytes: Rb is the base resistance at t = 0, Rp is the resistance at t = tp the pulse time, Rsat is the resistance at maximum adsorption capacity of a sensor, and
θ is the fractional coverage of a sensor reaction sites at time t > 0.

Measuring the saturation
level ΔRsat of a sensor is necessary
in determining the coverage fraction θ
required for calculating the AD parameters through the fit of eqs 3 and 4 to experimental data. The ΔRsat of a sensor also determines its capacity to contain analytes, and,
as a result, its reliability (discussed below).

A typical fit
of eqs 3 and 4 to the experimental data of nine out
of twelve sensors described in the Experimental Section are represented in Figure 2. No detection signals were observed by sensors B3, B4, and
T4; therefore, they have not been included in the analysis.

Figure 2 Typical fit
of eqs 3 and 4 (solid lines) to experimental data (dots)
described in the Experimental Section. The
point p on the pulse time define tp and the point s defines ts, viz the starting time of the slow desorption process.

The shape of the detection signal depicted in Figure 2 is governed by ka and kd,a in the
adsorption
stage and kd in the free desorption stage.
The adsorption stage operates during the inlet concentration pulse
0 ≤ t ≤ tp. During the time span tp, two simultaneous
processes are active: analyte adsorption on the binding sites and
desorption of a part of the bounded analytes. The net adsorbed molecules
shape the adsorption part of the detection signal. The desorption
stage during tp ≤ t ≤ ts is characterized by fast
free desorption (FFD). This stage is attributed to desorption of analytes
from the outer layers of the ligands capping the nanoparticles. Analytes
in deeper layers need first to diffuse out to the sensor’s
surface before desorption. This stage occurs at t > ts as shown by the “tail”
in Figure 2.31Equation 4 may also be applied to the tail shape of the data (see Figure 2 for t > ts) to simulate the slower desorption
rate constants ks. The measurement method
used to obtain signal detection (described in Figures 1 and 2) provides complete
information on the sensor’s response.

Fit results of eqs 3 and 4 to the nine sensors data yield AD rate
constants that determine the detection signal, as presented in Table 1. The maximum measured
coverage range is between θp = 0.28—0.75,
with maximum sensor signal (capacity) ranging from 933 to 375 890
Ω.

a Desorption parameters are for t > tp. T# and B# indicate top
and bottom placement of the sensors respectively. Its associated numbers
# indicate sensors’ position in the chamber along the flow
direction. The data are arranged in the ascending order of the sensor
capacity ΔRmax of octane-binding
sites.

b The capacity, ΔRmax = Rsat – Rb. Rsat is the saturation
resistance at θ = 1 and Rb is the
base resistance at θ = 0, defined graphically in Figure 2.

Sensor capacity listed in Table 1 varies within 5 orders of magnitude. The
impact of
such a wide range of capacities on the sensor’s reliability
will be discussed later. However, a much lower range of the adsorption
rate constant ka·C0 (ca order of magnitude) indicates the adsorbability
range of the tested sensors. The desorption rate constant, kd, shows the narrowest variation range of the
nine sensors, indicating kd as practically
invariable. This result is very significant in the reliability test
to be discussed below. Measurement results of Rb are listed in Table 1. The results show that the basic resistance, Rb, has a good correlation with the sensor capacity ΔRmax (Figure 3B). However, two pairs of sensors B5 & T1 and T2
& B1 exhibit an unexpected ascending order by changing places.
As each pair of sensors are pretty close to each other we may attribute
these shifts to measurements fluctuations such as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 3 (A) Impact of sensor
capacity ΔRmax on the rate of desorption
−Δθps/Δtps (between the points p and s defined in figure) and on the desorption constant kd. (B) Comparing impacts of Rb and ΔRmax on the RL.

Desorption
During t > tp, desorption of the analytes is undisturbed by adsorption.
Therefore, desorption of analytes at the adsorption stage kd,a for t ≤ tp is lower by 14–45% than the free desorption
rate constant kd (t > tp). This result indicates that during the adsorption
stage, analytes motion toward the binding sites on the sensor surface
slows down the disconnection of already connected analytes from the
binding sites. We denote points, p and s, in Figure 2, as
points of pulse time tp and start time ts of slow free desorption (SFD). During tp – ts, FFD
occurs. The concept “free” means pure desorption without
adsorption disturbances. The fast concept indicates disconnection
of adsorbed molecules on the sensor surface and the slow step indicates
molecules adsorbed in the inner layers of the sensors that need first
to diffuse to the sensor surface before desorption.

FFD parameters
of the nine sensors are summarized in Table 2. The last column of the table gives the
desorption rates between 0.068 and 0.364 1/s. The SFD starts at ts about 1.7 s after the pulse ends at tp as shown in column 5 of Table 2.

desorption rate during ts – tp.

It is worth noting that in Table 2, the timespan of the FFD is practically ts – tp = 1.7 s for
seven sensors and 1.2 s for the rest of the two sensors. These results
indicate the impact of similar thickness of the active layers (1.7–2
μm). The thickness impact on desorption relates to several possible
desorption mechanisms:32 surface reaction,
inner particle diffusion, pore diffusion, film diffusion, and external
diffusion. Desorption results shown in Figure 2 may be related to two main desorption mechanisms:
(1) external diffusion or FFD of the analytes between tp – ts (Figure 2) and (2) some combination
of the diffusion mechanisms within the active layers resulting in
rate-limiting mechanisms32 that slow down
the rate desorption after ts, which is
the “tail” zone.

Definition of the Reliability
Limit
Sensor capacity
means the maximum detection signal that a sensor can produce for a
given analyte. Alternatively, it is the maximum resistance change
a sensor can have for a given analyte. In the case of our data in Figure 1, ΔRmax is a sensor capacity. Figure 3A shows that the desorption rate constant kd versus capacity ΔRmax graph is clearly distinct between regular and dispersed
points. A distinction limit of ΔRmax = 0.016 MΩ is obtained by the rate of desorption −Δθps/Δtps between points p and s defined in Figure 2. It is less clear and sharp limit differentiates
between ordered and disordered points. For capacities <0.016 MΩ,
both rate and rate constant of desorption have dispersed and unclear
dependency on the capacity. We define reliability limit (RL) (= 0.016
MΩ in this case) as the RL for detection signals of sensors
between reliable (ΔR ≥ RL) and unreliable
(ΔR < RL) signals. The RLs are determined
by reliability indicators such as kd and
−Δθps/Δtps. Base resistance Rb of the AD
signal listed in Table 1 shows that Rb is usually proportional
to ΔRmax. For this reason, it is
interesting to check its ability to provide RL and its sharpness compared
to that of the capacity, ΔRmax. Figure 3B shows that it is
possible to determine RL based on kd–Rb test. Its advantage is sparing ΔRmax experiments. However, kd–ΔRmax test
has two advantages over the kd–Rb test: sharper RL and RL determined in a smaller
capacity point, that is, more sensors become reliable. Results in Figure 4 show an example
of indicator ka·C0/kd,a that yields further
less clear RL than that of kd which yields
the sharpest limit of the three above indicators. More data are needed
to support the consistency of these results.

Figure 4 Impact of sensor capacity
ΔRmax on the adsorption rate constant ka·p/p0 relative to desorption
rate constant kd,a during the adsorption
stage.

Results in Figures 3 and 4 show that AD
parameters are related
to sensor’s capacity ΔRmax and to the base resistance Rb. Of the
AD parameters, kd shows the clearest relationship,
namely, it clearly divides ordered and disordered points and enables
determination of RL as well as the limit between the two groups of
points.

Signal Analysis of the Ionogel (BmimNTf2) Sensor
Thus far, we have described the analysis of detection signals based
on experimental data of adsorbed octane on nine different sensors,
as described in the Experimental Section.
In this section, we have used existing data in Figure 3 of ref (33) to analyze detection signals
of one sensor with 7 VOCs. The data in ref (33) contain 28 AD graphs of 7 VOCs. Adsorption capacity ac at a concentration of p/p0 = c is derived for each of the 4 concentrations
(p/p0 = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5) of the 7 VOCs. Following the evaluation of the capacities a0.2 to a0.5 for
each VOC, the capacities were then extrapolated to obtain an evaluation
of the maximum capacity a1 at p/p0 = 1, which is considered
as the capacity of the sensor BmimNTf2 surface to adsorb
a specific VOC. Table 3 contains a list of absorption capacities for these 7 VOCs.

Table 3 Maximum Capacity a1 =
(I1 – I0)/I0 Evaluated for the Seven
VOCs on the BmimNTf2 Surface

a1	2.55	3.59	10.9	19.9	28.6	34.5	47.8	
The fraction of surface
coverage defined as θ = a/a1 or (I – I0)/(I1 – I0) was calculated for each of the seven VOCs
and four concentrations using a1 from Table 3. Then, AD parameters
for each concentration of p/p0 = 0.2–0.5, ka·C0, kd,a, and kd, were derived from the fit of eqs 2 and 4 to
the data of ref (33). Each value in Table 4 was averaged over the four concentrations, p/p0 = 0.2–0.5. The capacity range of the
ionogel sensor between the toluene and ethanol in Table 3 is ∼1 order of magnitude.
This is a very narrow range compared to the 5 orders of magnitudes
of the capacity range of the nine sensors with one VOC listed in Table 1.

are averaged over four concentrations p/p0 = 0.2–0.5.

Comparison of the results in Figures 2 and 5 yields a much slower FFD of the ionogel sensor
than that of the 9 sensors represented in Figure 2. The kd changes
about 2-fold between the 2 datasets listed in Tables 2 and 5. Existence of sharp RLs in both datasets shown in Figures 3 and 6 is because of the similar kd range
in both of them despite the differences in FFDs and capacity ranges.
The ratio kd,a/kd changes within 0.16–0.58 in Table 4 and is greater than that of the nine sensors
0.14–0.45 in Table 1. This may be related to the differences between the 2 FFDs.
High desorption speed yields higher disturbances to desorption by
the adsorbed VOCs.

Impact of Adsorption Capacity a1 of the BmimNTf2 Sensor on AD Parameters
The
plot of kd versus a1 in Figure 6 shows that the lowest three capacities (blue dots) have different
behavior than the higher capacities. It shows that a RL is within a1 = 10.9–19.9. This result supports the
existence of the RL found from analyzing our data, as shown in Figures 3 and 4. Further support for the existence of RL can be found in Figure 7, in which toluene
and hexane—with the lowest capacities in the BmimNTf2 sensor—show irregular behavior compared with the other five
VOCs. It is noteworthy that there is a disagreement in the RL values
between the two reliability indicators kd in Figure 6 and ka·(p/p0)/kda in Figure 7. However, because the kd indicator shows the sharpest RL in Figures 4 and 5, it is more likely that the dichloromethane capacity is below
the RL. More experiments are needed to determine the RL accompanied
by a theoretical basis.

of adsorption over desorption (ka·p/p0)/kda during the adsorption time.

Relationships between Sensor Sensitivity and Capacity
Sensitivity, S, of a sensor is defined as a change
in the sensor’s response to VOCs adsorption due to changes
in the VOC concentration.34 Accordingly,
the sensitivity of the BmimNTf2 sensor to the seven VOCs
from ref (33) can be
obtained from the slope of each curve in Figure 8. Plotting the resulting slopes versus sensor capacity gives a linear
increase of the sensitivity with sensor capacity (Figure 9).

Discussion
Quantitative Reliability Measure of a Sensor
Figure 3 shows a capacity
limit of ΔRmax = 0.016 MΩ,
above which kd increases linearly with
capacity. On the other hand, sensors with capacities <0.016 MΩ kd dispersed irregularly with ΔRmax. We take the limit between the regular and
irregular dependency of kd on ΔRmax as a RL. The kd in this case is the reliability indicator. The resulting conclusion
from this reliability test is that sensors T1, T3, T6, and B5 are
unreliable, whereas others listed in Table 2 are reliable. Other experimental results
show that basic resistance Rb is proportional
to the capacity ΔRmax. Although
it saves saturation experiments for measuring the ΔRmax, the results show that RL based on kd–Rb test is less sharp
and longer than the RL of kd–ΔRmax test. Reliability test with the data of
ref (33) reveals that
the ionogel sensor is unreliable in detecting signals of toluene,
hexane, and dichloromethane. Similar results are shown in Figure 3, with a rate decrease
of the coverage fraction θ with the time between points p and s defined in Figure 2. This reliability indicator is less sharp
than that of kd. The ratio of adsorption
over desorption rate constants for t ≤ tp as another reliability indicator yields a
further less sharp RL, as seen in Figure 4. The reliability indicator kd when applied to the data of ref (33) yields an RL within 10.9
< a1 < 19.9. More VOCs would further
sharpen the RL, as shown in Figure 6. The AD ratio for t ≤ tp in Figure 7 clearly differentiates toluene and hexane with lowest
capacities a1, but failed to differentiate
the next lowest capacity of dichloromethane. These results imply that
the reliability indicator kd gives the
sharpest RL compared with other AD indicators. Further experiments
dedicated to RL determination are needed as a basis for future theoretical
evaluation of RL.

Relationship between Sensor Capacity and
Sensitivity
Detection signals of the 7 VOCs of ref (33) against the concentration p/p0 are plotted in Figure 8. The slopes in these
graphs define sensitivity, S. Plotting the resulted S against the
capacity a1 of the VOCs gives a linear
relationship between S and a1, as shown in Figure 9, which means that the higher the sensor’s capacity,
the higher is its sensitivity.

Summary and Conclusions
The purpose of this study was to relate sensor detection functions,
such as reliability and sensitivity, to AD parameters of the detection
signals derived from the fit of the equations of our analytical model
to the experimental data. The results show that (1) sensors with high
capacity are more reliable and sensitive to detecting signals of VOCs
than sensors with lower capacities; (2) there is a sensor capacity
limit, below which sensors are unreliable; (3) the most reliable indicator
that provides the sharpest RL is the desorption rate constant kd; and (4) sensitivity of sensors increases
linearly with their capacities. Altogether, sensors with high capacities
are more reliable and sensitive to detecting signals of VOCs than
sensors with lower capacities. Results show that basic resistance Rb is proportional to ΔRmax. However, it yields less sharp and longer RL. Because
it saves experiments of ΔRmax, it
may provide a rough estimation of RL.

Experimental Section
Sensors
Used to Produce Detection Signals
The sensors
tested in the experiment were made of monolayer-capped GPNs, as described
in ref (9) and illustrated
in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Experimental system. (A) Drawing of the exposure cell
with top
six and bottom six sensors. The colors illustrate the detection signal
position of the adsorbed concentration of octane. (B) Informative
diagram of the experiment setup.

An array of 12 different GNP (ligand-capped)-based sensors was
constructed. Different ligands capping the GPNs provide a different
sensing capacity for the sensors, while maintaining a single drop
of each capped GNP solution upon each sensor using the drop-casting
method. The resulting layer thickness of the all GNP layers are within
1.7–2 μm. Exposure to VOC samples induce a different
response for each different sensor, resulting in a unique pattern
relating to the exposed sample. Table 5 summarizes the capping ligands of the GNPs. The 12
sensors were arranged in the measurement system with six sensors on
the top and 6 on the bottom facing each other, whereas the flow is
moving in the gaps between them (Figure 10A).

The majority of the tested sensors
listed in Table 5 are
based on thiol derivatives. Other ligands
that are based on thiol derivatives were used to test detection signals
based on two thin film-capped methods: layer-by-layer and drop-casting.29 These ligands show high sensitivity to VOCs
such as hexane, ethyl benzene, and ethanol for the drop-casting method.

Exposure System
The system comprised a gas generator
system (Umwelttechnik MCZ GmbH IC2000RL gas calibration system) connected
to a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus Pump 11 Pico Plus Elite) using
a 250 μL Trajan SGE syringe. The gas generator system was connected
to a measurement system (developed and manufactured by JLM Innovation
GmbH, Tübingen, Germany) by a T-junction before a flowmeter
and a solenoid valve. The same configuration was set up for the dry
air inlet. Both flowmeters were set arbitrarily to 2.25 L/min, and
the valves were controlled by LabVIEW software and an NI DAQ system. Figure 10B shows a diagram
of the experimental setup used. The measurement system consists of
an internal pump (flow 143 mL/min) and sensors’ chamber with
12 slots. The sampling rate of the sensors was 10 Hz with <0.1%
error in the measurement of resistance.

Measurement of Changes
in Sensor Resistance Following Octane
Adsorption
The sensors were stored overnight in a vacuum.
On the day of the experiment, the sensors were mounted in the testing
chamber inside the measurement system open to room air. The internal
pump of the measurement system remained active throughout the whole
experiment. At the first stage, the baseline was obtained by exposing
the sensors to dry air (i.e., the dry air valve open and gas generator
system valve closed). After obtaining a steady signal from all sensors,
a pulse of 8.1 ppm n-octane (>99%, Merck KGaA)
was
introduced (i.e., gas generator system valve open and dry air valve
is closed) for 10 s, followed by dry air. After returning to the baseline,
the sensors were re-exposed to n-octane, but this
time, it was left to reach saturation.
