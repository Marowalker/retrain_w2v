Crystal α-zirconium
phosphate (α-ZrP) was prepared
by a hydrothermal method and exfoliated into a layered structure by n-hexylamine (C6H13NH2).
Ni-based catalyst (Ni/ZrP) was promoted by loading nickel on the layered
α-ZrP via ion exchange. The catalyst was performed to catalyze
hydrodeoxygenation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) to 2,5-dimethylfuran
(DMF), and a 68.1% yield of DMF and 100% conversion of HMF were achieved
at 240 °C, 5 MPa H2, and 20 h. The DMF yield can still
retain 52.8% after five cycles. The characteristics of the catalyst
were investigated via N2 adsorption–desorption,
X-ray diffraction, field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy, pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra, FTIR spectra, inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry, and thermogravimetric analysis–mass spectrometry,
as well as Raman spectroscopy. A pathway from HMF to DMF was found
with MF as the intermediate product, and DMF production was preferable
via the −CH2OH group hydrogenolysis of HMF over
Lewis acidic sites of Ni/ZrP, which is caused by the zirconium vacant
orbits.

1 Introduction
As the world population
grows and the economy expands, only fossil
fuels have been unable to meet the human survival and development
about the huge demand for chemicals and energy. Abundant biomass resources
are a promising alternative for the sustainable supply of valuable
chemicals (such as alcohols, aldehydes carboxylic acids, and gasoline
alkanes) to the chemical industry for the production of drugs, polymeric
materials, and fuels.1−3 As an inexpensive and easily available feedstock,
lignocellulosic biomass is the most abundant class among the biomass
resources. Cellulosic biomass can be converted into liquid biofuels
by thermochemical and hydrolysis routes, and lignocellulose can be
transformed into a platform material—5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF)—by means of chemical catalysis.4 As a versatile platform chemical, HMF can form a number of important
C6 compounds, such as 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF), 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid, 5-hydroxymethylfuroic acid, 2,5-dihydroxymethylfuran (DHMF),
alkoxymethylfurfurals, and so forth.5 Among
these compounds, DMF (belonging to the second-generation biofuels6) was proposed as a promising transportation fuel
with higher boiling point, higher energy density, and lower solubility
in aqueous solutions compared to ethanol.7 Román-Leshkov et al. have converted carbohydrates to DMF
for use as a liquid transportation fuel earlier.8 Recently, Zu et al. have utilized Ru/Co3O4 to produce DMF from HMF under relatively mild conditions.9

Zirconium phosphate (ZrP), a kind of layered
solid acid,10 has been developed to be
a class of multifunctional
materials in recent years.11,12 α-ZrP (Zr(HPO4)2·H2O) is one of the most important
ZrPs that has been prepared by various methods, among which crystalline
ZrPs can be prepared by a hydrothermal synthesis method.13,14 Synthetic α-ZrP can be easily intercalated by amines and then
exfoliated to prepare polymer nanocomposites.14,15 More importantly, the ZrP-type materials have been widely used in
biomass catalytic conversion. Some studies have been developed to
apply α-ZrP with its acid property to produce biomass-derived
platform chemicals, such as levulinic acid,16 HMF,17 polyols,18 and so forth. However, using ZrP as the support to load metal species
for hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of HMF to DMF was rarely reported in
recent work. Moreover, many studies about the HDO process are involved
in the application of high-price noble metals. The development of
non-noble substitutes (base metal) has attracted great attention in
both academic and industrial aspects.19,20 Because of
the different functional groups (such as C=O, CH2–OH, and furan ring) in HMF, HDO of HMF to DMF needs C=O
hydrogenation to generate the corresponding −OH groups and
subsequent C–OH group deoxygenation,21 and the hydrogenation of C=O bonds over the non-noble metal
catalytic sites can promote a selective production of DMF.22,23

In this work, we prepared a Lewis acid ZrP-supported Ni catalyst
to achieve the aim. Briefly, crystal α-ZrP was prepared through
a hydrothermal method and exfoliated into a layered structure by n-hexylamine (C6H13NH2).
Ni/ZrP was manufactured by inserting Ni2+ into the layers
of amine-intercalated ZrP via ion exchange. After reduction, the Ni/ZrP
catalyst was used for catalyzing HDO of HMF to DMF in tetrahydrofuran
(THF). The catalyst was investigated by a series of characteristic
methods, and the transformation pathway of HMF to DMF was also elucidated.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Catalyst Characterization
The data
of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda
(BJH) pore size distribution of pristine α-ZrP and exfoliated
α-ZrP are demonstrated in Figure 1 and Table 1, respectively. In Figure 1a, pristine α-ZrP has a BET surface area of 22.5
m2/g and a pore volume of 0.2 cm3/g. In terms
of the BJH method, pristine α-ZrP has a pore size of 26.4 nm
as displayed in the inset of Figure 1a. Exfoliation of α-ZrP causes the coexistence
of mesopores and macropores, as well as the scattered pore size distribution,
which leads to the appearance of artificial pores at around 4 nm (see
the inset of Figure 1b–d).24 In addition, exfoliated
α-ZrP and freshly reduced Ni/ZrP have been changed with the
BET surface area of 26.1 m2/g, pore volume of 0.1 cm3/g, and pore diameter of 14.3 nm compared with those of α-ZrP
(Table 1, entries 1
and 2), which is explained by the intercalation of C6H13NH2 into Zr(HPO4)2·H2O layers shown in Figure 1b,c.

α-ZrP,

Ni/ZrP.

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) of pristine α-ZrP and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of pristine α-ZrP, exfoliated
α-ZrP, NiO/ZrP, and freshly reduced Ni/ZrP are shown in Figure 2a–g, as well
as the Ni particle size distribution of freshly reduced Ni/ZrP and
spent Ni/ZrP is depicted in Figure 2h,i. We can see that the average particle size and
thickness of the α-ZrP hexagonal nanoplatelets are about 288
and 20 nm, respectively, in Figure 2a, which demonstrates the overall appearance of pristine
α-ZrP. α-ZrP has a crystal structure with a measured interplanar
spacing d = 0.35 nm shown in the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image of Figure 2b, belonging to the (001) facet25 of the hexagonal crystal. The crystal structure is composed of alternating
HPO4 tetrahedra and ZrO4 tetrahedra (as the
structure unit) to form the layered structure (for the structure unit
of layered α-ZrP, see Scheme 1).26,27

Comparing Figure 2b with 2c, we can see that the crystal α-ZrP
nanoplatelets tend to be transparent and rolled up on the edge of
the nanoplatelets, which shows that α-ZrPs are exfoliated by
C6H13NH2 successfully. In Figure 2d, we can observe
that very tiny particles of NiO/ZrP are evenly dispersed over the
surface of α-ZrP, whereas the Ni particles of freshly reduced
Ni/ZrP were aggregated into larger particles with the Ni(111) facet,
possessing metal stripes with d = 0.2 nm28 (see Figure 2e). Figure 2f shows the TEM image of Ni/ZrP, from which we can observe
that the reduced Ni particles have an average size of about 30.3 nm
on the α-ZrP layers.

The elemental mapping images (P,
Zr, and Ni) of the freshly reduced
Ni/ZrP catalyst are shown in Figure 3. We can observe that the P and Zr elements are homogeneously
distributed on the ZrP carrier in Figure 3a,b, respectively, whereas the Ni element
is distributed with cluster shapes, which is consistent with the Ni
species distribution shown in Figure 3c.

Figure 3 Elemental mapping images of (a) P, (b) Zr, and (c) Ni
in the freshly
reduced Ni/ZrP catalyst.

The conventional X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of pristine
α-ZrP,
exfoliated α-ZrP, Ni2+/ZrP, NiO/ZrP, freshly reduced
Ni/ZrP, and spent Ni/ZrP are given in Figure 4I(a–f), respectively. In the case
of α-ZrP, the peaks appearing at 2θ = 10.5°, 2θ
= 20°, and 2θ = 25° are the characteristic peak of
α-ZrP, corresponding to the (002), (110), and (112) planes,
respectively.25 After being exfoliated
by C6H13NH2, the reflected peaks
of (110) and (112) planes have been transferred to 2θ = 7.7°
and 11.5° by comparing Figure 4I(a) and 4I(b). In addition,
the (002) planes transferred to 2θ = 3.8° can be observed
via the analysis of the small angle (2θ = 0.6°–5°)
of pristine α-ZrP and exfoliated α-ZrP (Figure 4II). According to Bragg’s
law, the d of exfoliated α-ZrP at 2θ
= 3.8° has been increased to 2.32 nm compared with that of pristine
α-ZrP at 2θ = 10.5° with 0.74 nm. In Figure 4c, the peaks at 2θ =
9.3° and 28.2° show the formation of nickel phosphate hydrate
(PDF-#31-0909), which can prove the cation exchange of (C6H13NH3)22+ with Ni2+. Ni(111), Ni(200), and Ni(220) appear at 2θ = 44.6°,
51.4°, and 75.8°, respectively, by comparing Figure 4I(d) and 4I(e),29 which illustrates the reduction
of Ni oxidation species on the ZrP carrier. Additionally, the Ni particles
agglomerate into larger ones with an average particle size of 52 nm
(Figure 2h) after the
reaction, facilitating that the XRD intensity of the spent catalyst
is enhanced (see Figure 4If).

freshly reduced Ni/ZrP, and (f) spent Ni/ZrP. (II) Small angle of
XRD patterns of (a) pristine α-ZrP and (b) exfoliated α-ZrP.

As shown in Figure 5, the weight of Ni/ZrP loses 6.7% during
the whole heating process,
which is caused by the decomposition of Zr(HPO4)2·H2O. Three strong ion current signals of H2O+ (m/z = 18) at about
310, 450, and 670 °C also prove the fact that H2O
is released from the dehydration of P–OH groups in ZrP.

spectrometry (MS) curve of freshly reduced Ni/ZrP

To understand the change in the
acidic sites of the ZrP-type catalyst,
the pyridine-adsorbed Fourier transform infrared (Py-FTIR) spectra
and acid density of pristine α-ZrP, exfoliated α-ZrP,
freshly reduced Ni/ZrP, and spent Ni/ZrP at different desorption temperatures
(40, 150, and 240 °C) are shown in Figure 6 and Table 2, respectively. In Figure 6a and Table 2, entry 1, there are two bands at around 1450 and 1540
cm–1, which represent the Lewis (L) and Brönsted
(B) acidic sites, respectively.30,31 The L and B acidic
sites are originated from the vacant orbits of Zr4+-contained
framework of four-coordination and P–OH groups, respectively.32,33 In Figure 6b and Table 2, entry 2, the L acid
density increases and the B acid density is seriously lost, which
are caused by the intercalation of C6H13NH2 into the Zr(HPO4)2 layer. In Figure 6c,d and Table 2, entries 3 and 4,
the acidity of the Ni/ZrP catalyst is mainly in the form of L acid,
along with the L acid density of spent Ni/ZrP seriously lost. The
L acid densities of all the samples tend to decrease via exfoliation,
ion exchange, calcination, and reduction, and they decrease with the
increase of evacuation temperature simultaneously (Table 2).

The FTIR spectra of α-ZrP,
exfoliated α-ZrP, Ni2+/ZrP, NiO/ZrP, and freshly
reduced Ni/ZrP are shown in Figure 7. The peaks at 3594,
3510, and 1620 cm–1 are from H2O symmetric
and asymmetric stretching and bending vibrations.34 In Figure 7a, the peak at 532 cm–1 ascribes to Zr–O
group deformation vibration,35 and the
strong band in the range of 965–1120 cm–1 is characteristic of PO4 group stretching vibrations.36 In Figure 7b, the peak at 2960 is assigned to −CH3 stretching vibrations, the peaks at 2920 and 2850 are from −CH2 stretching vibrations, and the band in the range of 1590–1650
cm–1 and the peak at 1202 cm–1 ascribe to −NH and −N–C stretching vibrations
from C6H13NH2, which demonstrates
the exfoliation of pristine α-ZrP by C6H13NH2. In Figure 7c, all the peaks associated with C6H13NH3+ disappear, and an absorption band at 1383
cm–1 related to the NO3– residue37 was observed during the cation
exchange of C6H13NH3+ with
Ni2+, indicating that almost all C6H13NH3+ is replaced by Ni2+. The NO3– peak becomes broad gradually after catalyst
calcination and reduction shown in Figure 7d,e (for specific process, see Scheme 2). There is no P–OH
stretching at around 2300 cm–138 associated with B acid, showing the fact that the acidity
of Ni/ZrP is mainly in the form of L acid.

2.2 Catalytic
Performance
The catalyst
was tested in the HDO of HMF to produce DMF. During the reaction process,
DHMF and MF were the main intermediates along with different reaction
pathways. Meanwhile, the products mainly contained the O-containing
intermediates [e.g., 5-methyl-2-furfurylalcohol (MFA) and 2,5-dihydroxymethyltetrahydrofuran
(DHMTHF)] and the over-hydrogenated products such as DMTHF and 2,5-hexanedione
(HD) from the furan ring opening of DMF. Figure 8 shows the effect of different reaction parameters
in the HDO reaction of HMF, such as (a) temperature, (b) time, (c)
pressure, and (d) HMF dosage.

Figure 8 Variation of process parameters of (a) temperature,
(b) reaction
time, (c) hydrogen pressure, (d) HMF dosage, and (e) HDO of HMF in
5 h. Reaction conditions: (a) catalyst = 0.1 g, HMF = 0.25 g, 5 MPa
H2, rotating speed = 500 rpm, and 40 mL THF; (b) 5 MPa
H2, 240 °C, catalyst = 0.1 g, HMF = 0.25 g, rotating
speed = 500 rpm, and 40 mL; (c) 240 °C, 12 h, catalyst = 0.1
g, HMF = 0.25 g, rotating speed = 500 rpm, and 40 mL THF; (d) 5 MPa
H2, 12 h, catalyst = 0.1 g, 240 °C, rotating speed

catalyst = 0.1 g, HMF = 0.25 g, rotating speed = 500 rpm, and 40 mL
THF.

Figure 8a shows
the effect of temperature on the catalytic reaction, and we observed
that the HMF conversion changes from 84.8 to 97.2% as the temperature
increases from 180 to 260 °C. DMF reaches a higher yield of 63.9%
at 240 °C, accompanied with the intermediate: MF (6.3%), over-hydrogenated
products: DHMTHF (6.2%) and tetrahydro-5-methyl-2-furanmethanol (MTHFA)
(1.3%), and the furan ring-opening product: HD (4.0%). Among them,
the HD yield continues to increase caused by furan opening at higher
temperature. However, the DMF yield tends to decrease at 260 °C,
which is caused by the production of small molecular alkanes from
the cracking of chains on the furan ring39 and coke formation at the higher temperature. Therefore, too high
temperature is not favorable for DMF formation.

Figure 8b shows
the effect of reaction time on HMF conversion under 5 MPa H2 and 240 °C: HMF is almost converted after 8 h, and its yield
reaches a maximum yield of 68.1% at 20 h, followed by MF (8.4%), DHMTHF
(5.2%), MTHFA (0.2%), and HD (2.9%) formation. Thus, a reasonable
control of temperature and pressure with an appropriately prolonged
reaction time can suppress the production of byproducts and intermediate
products.

Figure 8c represents
the effect of pressure on HMF conversion, from which we observe that
HMF conversion reaches more than 97% when H2 pressure is
more than 2 MPa, and the DMF yield and DHMTHF increase consecutively
as the reaction pressure increases. Thus, increasing H2 pressure is conducive for DMF and byproduct (such as DHMTHF) production.

Figure 8d shows
the effect of HMF dosage on catalytic conversion: HMF is almost converted
under all HMF dosages, with 250 mg as the optimal dosage, and DMF
gains the highest yield under the corresponding reaction conditions.
However, the DMF yield decreases and the MF yield increases with an
increase of HMF dosage, which is caused by the insufficient Ni/ZrP
catalytic activity in this HDO process.

Conclusively, DMF reaches
a maximum yield of 68.1%, with HMF converted
completely under the reaction condition of 5 MPa H2, 240
°C, and 20 h.

To further clarify the MF distribution, we
conducted an HDO experiment
of HMF within the initial 5 h under optimal conditions. In Figure 8e, the MF yield
trend undergoes an increase first before 2.5 h and then decreases
after 2.5 h, whereas the DMF yield continues to increase for 5 h,
demonstrating that part of MF has been converted to DMF. The other
byproducts, such as DHMTHF and HD, retain a low yield as the time
goes on, showing the existence of MF as the important intermediate.

2.3 Possible Reaction Pathway
The two
distinct pathways were associated with the production of DMF from
HMF, and MF is produced as an intermediate in the pathways (see Scheme 3).20,40 Interestingly, MF is detected during all the batch catalytic experiments
in our study. Moreover, it possesses a higher proportion and plays
a key role in all of the over-hydrogenated products, which also proves
HDO reaction pathway from HMF into DMF via MF. Additionally, the detection
of a small amount of DHMTHF (over-hydrogenated product) explains another
HDO pathway from HMF into DMF via DHMF (as well as MFA, all with low
productivity, and the yield cannot be calculated by the minimum detection
limit of GC). Meanwhile, the byproducts mainly also contained over-hydrogenated
products such as tetrahydro-5-methyl-2-furanmethanol (MTHFM) and DHMTHF
and HD generated by DMF furan ring opening and hydration. L acidity
of Ni/ZrP favors the mentioned conversion pathway compared with other
researchers’ works. For example, Nakagawa and Tomishige have
reported that HMF cannot produce MF catalyzed by Ni–Pd/SiO2 without L acid,41 which may be
explained by the fact that the L acid sites on Ni/ZrP would effectively
accelerate the cleavage of the −CH2OH bond prior
to C=O bond in HMF.42 In addition,
Saha and Abu-Omar have studied the HDO of HMF over Ni/C without L
acids, and Ni/C can be accounted for only 10% HMF conversion with
the formation of a trace amount of DMF.43 Therefore, the insight into the conversion from HMF to DMF confirms
the reaction pathway proposed by some teams.20,44

Scheme 3 General Reaction Pathway for DMF Production from HMF
To corroborate this hypothesis, we carried out
the controlled HDO
reactions over Ni/ZrP by taking intermediate products (MF and DHMF)
as the substrate (see Table 3). When MF was used as the substrate, DMF acquires a yield
of 42.6%. On the contrary, when DHMF was employed as the substrate,
the DMF yield is just 6.9%.

According to the obtained experimental
results and reported studies,
a brief reaction pathway for the HDO of HMF to DMF is proposed in Scheme 4. First, Ni/ZrP is
facilely converted into Ni and ZrP with metal and acid functionalities
for activating H2 and −CH2OH groups,
respectively. The oxygen in the −CH2OH of HMF is
activated by the Lewis acidic sites of Zr4+ (originated
from the vacant orbit of Zr), which is easily hydrodeoxygenated to
MF as the primary intermediate because of attacking of H atoms activated
by the neighboring Ni metal. Second, the oxygen in the carbonyl group
of MF is activated by the Zr4+ species, followed by hydrogenolysis
via MFA. MFA is a precursor to be converted into DMF, which means
that HMF was transformed into MFA directly or indirectly during the
hydrogenolysis process. Besides the main pathway, the side products
such as MTHFA and HD were observed in these cases, which is responsible
for the unwanted furan ring hydrogenation of MFA and furan ring opening
and hydration of DMF.45 In terms of these
facts, the reaction pathway mentioned via the MF intermediate was
further confirmed.

DMF via MF
2.4 Catalyst
Stability
To investigate
the stability of the prepared catalyst, we selected the reaction condition
of 240 °C, 12 h, and 5 MPa H2 pressure as our testing
object. After each reaction, the catalyst was filtered, washed three
times with ethanol (through 0.22 μm Millipore filter), and dried
at 60 °C overnight. The collected catalyst was recalcined at
400 °C under air atmosphere for 3 h and reduced at 400 °C
for 2 h with a heating rate of 4 °C/min before the next recycling
experiments. Figure 9 shows the yield of DMF and Ni content of Ni/ZrP versus Ni/ZrP catalyst
usage cycles. It was found that the yield of DMF and Ni content of
Ni/ZrP show a positive correlation during the process. We summarize
that DMF can retain 52.8% of its original yield with Ni elemental
content decreasing from 18.2 to 12% after five consecutive cycles.
The continuous leaching Ni species can explain the decreasing activity
of Ni/ZrP during the batches of testing experiments. As we know, the
Ni species performs a key role in the selective conversion of C=O,
C=C, and C–O bonds of HMF, and leaching Ni also breaks
the balanced surface metal–acid sites of the catalyst.46

Figure 9 Yield of DMF and Ni content (wt %) of Ni/ZrP vs Ni/ZrP
recyclability.

The Raman spectra of
the freshly reduced Ni/ZrP (a) and spent Ni/ZrP
(b) are demonstrated in Figure 10. Comparing Figure 10a with 10b, we can see that
the significant bands at 1375 cm–1 from C–C
skeleton modes associated with chemical structures consist of condensed
benzene rings and the G peak at around 1590 cm–1 from disordered graphite.47,48 Therefore, the coke
deposition can explain the activity decline of the catalyst to some
extent. Besides, the position between 22° and 35° of the
peak in the low angle region corresponds to the (002) peak of graphite,
caused by the stacking of the graphitic basal planes of char crystallites
(see Figure 4d).49 As the reaction proceeds, the pore volume and
pore size of the catalyst become smaller, thereby resulting in the
decreased BET surface area (see Figure 1d and Table 1, entry 4).

Ni/ZrP
catalyst and (b) spent Ni/ZrP catalyst.

under air atmosphere are shown in Figure 11. Figure 11a,b depicts the layers of dark spots, which were resulted
from coke deposition, while the spots disappear after the catalyst
is recalcined, shown in Figure 11c,d. Thereupon, Ni/ZrP recalcination we mentioned is
an effective way to dispel the coke. In a word, the catalytic activity
loss of Ni/ZrP can be summarized as follows: (i) Ni particle size
increases; (ii) Ni species is lost, which breaks the balance of metal–acid;
and (iii) formation of coke after the catalytic reaction. However,
based on Figure 8,
the main deactivation of the Ni/ZrP catalyst is deduced by Ni leaching.
The efforts for suppressing Ni leaching to enhance the catalytic stability
are in progress.

3 Conclusions
Pristine α-ZrP was
synthesized via a hydrothermal technology,
followed by exfoliation with C6H13NH2 to expand the surface area and porosity. Ni/ZrP was prepared by
ion exchange of exfoliated α-ZrP and Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, followed by calcination and reduction
at elevated temperatures. Ni/ZrP is characterized by a series of techniques,
and its catalytic performance was tested in the HDO of HMF to DMF.
We proposed a conversion path from HMF to DMF with MF as the main
intermediate and found that the synergistic effect of metallic Ni
and L acidic sites created from the zirconium vacant orbits on α-ZrP
is favorable for the hydrogenolysis of C–OH groups of HMF.
Ni/ZrP has a better performance on HDO of HMF to DMF with the target
product yield of 68.1% in the first run and presents the stability
by retaining its original activity of 52.8% after five runs.

4.2 Catalysts Preparation
4.2.1 Preparation of Pristine α-ZrP
According to the
literature,13 4.0 g of
ZrOCl2·8H2O was mixed with 40.0 mL (3.0
M) of H3PO4 solution and sealed into a Teflons-lined
pressure vessel and heated at 200 °C for 24 h. After the reaction,
the solid was filtered with deionized (DI) water through a 0.22 μm
Millipore filter (Jinteng, China) until the filtrate was neutral.
The product was dried at 60 °C overnight to obtain 2.4 g of pristine
α-ZrP.

4.2.2 Exfoliation of Pristine
α-ZrP
Referring to the literature,50 pristine
α-ZrP was interstratified by C6H13NH2. Briefly, 0.839 g of C6H13NH2 was dissolved in 20 mL of water, and then 1.0 g of solid α-ZrP
was added into the mixture. The mixture was stirred for 24 h at room
temperature. The solid phase was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm
for 10 min (RCF 10610, 10610TG16-WS, Hunan Xiangyi Centrifuge Co.
Ltd., China) in DI water twice and then centrifuged in acetone to
remove extra water and C6H13NH2.
The sample was dried at 60 °C to obtain the exfoliated α-ZrP.

4.2.3 Preparation of NiO/ZrP and Ni/ZrP
A solution
was prepared by dissolving 4.5 g of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O in 50 mL of DI water. An amine intercalation
sample (0.5 g) was added to this solution, and the mixture was refluxed
for 24 h at 80 °C. In this step, Ni2+ was loaded on
the layers of α-ZrP via ion exchange. The solid Ni2+/ZrP was recovered from the solution by centrifugation, washed extensively
with DI water, and dried at 60 °C overnight. Last, the solid
was calcined under air atmosphere at 500 °C for 4 h in a muffle
furnace (FO310C, Yamato Scientific Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), denoted
as NiO/ZrP.

Prior to the experiment, NiO/ZrP was reduced in
flowing H2 (30 mL/min, purity ≥ 99.9%) at a heating
rate of 4 °C/min to 400 °C for 2 h to obtain freshly reduced
Ni/ZrP.

4.3 Catalyst Characterization
XRD (X’Pert-ProMPD,
PANalytical Company, Almelo, Netherland) operated at 40 kV and 40
mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm) was performed to
compare the crystallinity of pristine α-ZrP, exfoliated α-ZrP,
NiO/ZrP, freshly reduced Ni/ZrP, and spent Ni/ZrP at room temperature.

The specific surface area of samples was measured by the BET equation,
and the pore size distribution was investigated by the BJH method
depending on N2 adsorption–desorption at −196
°C (IQ-2, Quantachrome Instruments, Boynton Beach, FL).

The structural and morphological information of pristine α-ZrP
was obtained by using a cold field emission scanning electron microscope
(S-4800, Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan). Pristine α-ZrP, exfoliated
α-ZrP, and freshly reduced Ni/ZrP were observed by a high-resolution
transmission electron microscope (JEM-2100, JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan)
equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (Thermo Scientific
UltraDry, Waltham, MA) to compare their microstructure. All samples
were dispersed in ethanol absolute and ultrasonicated 10 min for TEM
analysis.

Coke deposition on the catalyst was analyzed by a
Raman microscope
equipped with the 523 nm excitation wavelength laser diode and back-scattering
configuration (Lab RAM HR800-LS55, Horiba Jobin-Yvon, Paris, France),
and the spectral resolution was about 0.7 cm–1.

The Ni elemental content (wt %) of freshly reduced Ni/ZrP and used
Ni/ZrP was measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
(Agilent 7900, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). All the samples
were digested with 1 mL (30 wt %) of H2O2 and
2 mL (65 wt %) of HNO3 at 100 °C for 12 h and diluted
to the desired concentration for test.

The thermal stability
and composition of the prepared catalyst
are investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA; Linseis STA PT1600,
Selb, Germany) under N2 flow (purity ≥ 99.9%) with
a heating rate of 20 °C/min up to 1100 °C. H2O released from the catalyst decomposition is monitored via the mass
spectrometer (Pfeiffer Omnistar, Asslar, Germany). In order to investigate
whether the B and L acidity was present in the catalysts, the Py-FTIR
(Nicolet 6700, Nicolet Instrument Company, PA) spectrum at an average
of 32 scans and a resolution of 4 cm–1 was obtained
to analyze the feature. Sample (10 mg) was activated at 200 °C
for 0.5 h under vacuum (10–4 mmHg). The background
spectrum was recorded after cooling the sample to 50 °C. Afterward,
the sample was exposed to pyridine (Aldrich, GC, ≥99%) vapors
for 15 min. The FTIR spectrum for each sample was obtained after pyridine
desorption by evacuation for another 0.5 h at 40, 150, and 240 °C,
respectively. All the spectra were recorded at room temperature after
pyridine desorption at each temperature. The spectra were finally
obtained by subtracting the background spectrum previously recorded.

Samples involved in our research were characterized by an FTIR
spectrometer (Nicolet Nexus 10, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham,
MA) via the KBr pellet method (samples were analyzed at an average
of 32 scans from 400 to 4000 cm–1 at 2 cm–1 resolution).

4.4 Catalytic Performance
Freshly reduced
Ni/ZrP (0.1 g) was mixed with 0.25 g (1.98 × 10–3 mol) of HMF in 40 mL of THF solvent, and the reactions with specific
reaction time were performed in a 100 mL autoclave (MS-100-C276, Anhui
Kemi Machinery Technology Co., Ltd, Hefei, China) under the stirring
rate of 500 rpm. Before each run, the autoclave was purged three times
with H2 to exclude the air residual in the reactor. The
reaction was conducted at a certain temperature, H2 pressure
(inflated at room temperature), and time. After the reaction, the
reactor was quickly quenched in an ice–water bath. Subsequently,
filtration steps (through a 0.22 μm Millipore filter) were conducted,
and the reaction solution was collected to analyze the products. The
products were quantitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph (GC-2014C,
Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a flame-ionized detector and
a HP-Innowax capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm
film thickness, Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA).

The products
were qualitatively analyzed by a gas chromatograph–mass spectrometer
(Trace 1300-ISQ, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA) with
a HP-Innowax column, and their yields were calculated based on the
internal standard by using cyclohexanone as the internal standard.
The conversion (C mol, %) of HMF and the yield (C mol, %) of product were calculated as follows: 1   2
