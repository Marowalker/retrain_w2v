Reduction
of zirconia by water desorption from a hydrogenated surface
is the topic of this study. The focus is on the role of nanostructuring
the oxide reducibility measured by the cost of formation of oxygen
vacancies by water desorption. We have performed density functional
theory calculations using the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
+ U approach and including dispersion forces on the
adsorption, dissociation, diffusion of hydrogen on the ZrO2 (101) surface and on Zr16O32, Zr40O80, and Zr80O160 nanoparticles
(NPs). The process involves the formation of a precursor state via
diffusion of hydrogen on the surface of zirconia. The results show
that O vacancy formation via H2O desorption is more convenient
than via direct O2 desorption. The formation of an OsH2 surface precursor state to water desorption
is the rate-determining step. This step is highly unfavorable on the
ZrO2 (101) surface both thermodynamically and kinetically.
On the contrary, on zirconia NPs, characterized by the presence of
low coordinated ions, water desorption becomes accessible such that
even at temperatures close to 450 K the reaction becomes exergonic.
The study shows the role of nanostructuring on the chemical and electronic
properties of an oxide.

1 Introduction
Metal oxides represent
a very wide class of heterogeneous catalysts.
They can behave as inert supports for an active metal particle or
can directly participate in the catalytic process via active surface
species and/or basic/acid sites. The composition, structure, and size
of the oxide catalyst determine its chemical activity. Zirconium dioxide
(ZrO2) has been extensively used in various catalytic processes.
For example, in reactions involving hydrogen, zirconia is used in
hydrogenation reactions of CO2 and CO to synthesize organic
molecules,1−3 as well as in solid oxide fuel cells for the electrochemical
oxidation of H2 thanks to its stability over a wide range
of oxygen pressure and mechanical strength.4 In another context, zirconia is used as a catalyst for ketonization
reactions in the upgrading of bio-oil to reduce the oxygen content
of the biomass after a pyrolysis treatment.5,6

ZrO2 is considered to be a nonreducible oxide, more
similar to MgO and SiO2 than to TiO2 or CeO2. This can be attributed to the high ionicity and wide band
gap of ZrO2.7,8 This is a property observed in
large crystallites of zirconia, generally referred to as bulk zirconia.
The nonreducible nature of zirconia emerges quite clearly when the
material is exposed to hydrogen. The H2 molecule adsorbs
and dissociates on extended zirconia surfaces through a heterolytic
mechanism in which OH+ and ZrH– surface
groups are formed. This means that no oxide reduction takes place
(no formation of adsorbed protons and of Zr3+ ions).9−11 Another indicator of the low reducibility of this oxide comes from
the cost to create a surface O vacancy in the bulk or on the surface
of the material (∼6 eV12). However,
the physical and chemical properties of oxides can change dramatically
when the material is prepared in the form of nanoparticles (NPs),
nanowires, and thin films or in general is nanostructured.13,14 In fact, quantum confinement effects, undercoordination, and the
special structural flexibility typical of many nanostructures, often
referred to as fluxionality, result in novel properties that are not
observed in the bulk regime.15−17 For instance, we have recently
found that zirconia prepared in the form of 1–2 nm particles
splits the H2 molecule through a homolytic process, with
the formation of Zr3+ (4d1) centers. This is
the same mechanism observed on reducible oxides such as TiO2 and CeO2.18−20 In this process, two OH+ species form
and two electrons (coming from the H2 molecule) reduce
two low coordinated Zr4+ to Zr3+ centers (giving
rise to a magnetic ground state).8,21 In addition,
the formation energy of a neutral O vacancy decreases by 2–3
eV when it is created on special sites of the NP.7,8 The
reducible character of the nanostructures comes from the presence
of low coordinated Zr sites in edges and corners, which introduce
low-lying Zr 4d states that accept the charge released from the H2 molecule or from the removed O atom.

In general, the
interest toward novel forms of reduced ZrO2 is increasing.
For example, it has been demonstrated that
O-deficient ZrO2–x NPs display
better catalytic activity in reactions of transformation of biomass
into fuels,5,22,23 high-temperature hydrocarbon conversion,24 and H2 production under solar light, all reactions where
stoichiometric ZrO2 is less active or even inert.25 The enhanced catalytic activity has been related
to the presence of surface acidic Zr3+ sites. In a different
field, reduced, dopant-free ZrO2 nanostructures have been
shown to exhibit ferromagnetic behavior because of the presence of
oxygen vacancies.26

Apart from direct
interaction with H2, there are several
mechanisms for the reduction of the oxide surface. In the presence
of deposited metal particles, O surface ions can spill over the metal,
leaving a surface O vacancy (reverse spillover). This process has
been estimated to cost only 0.2 and 0.6 eV on a Ru10 cluster
supported on TiO2 and ZrO2, respectively.27 The cost is expected to be even lower at surface
steps and edges28,29 and is further reduced when the
metallic clusters are supported on an oxide NP.30 The oxide surface can also be reduced by a hydrogenation
process and subsequent desorption of water, leaving behind an O vacancy
and its associated charge (H2 + O2– →
H2O + 2e–(Vo)). In the latter
case, the presence of a supported metal particle can facilitate the
dissociation of H2 and the spillover of hydrogen on the
surface to form OH+ groups and reduced metal cations. Alternatively,
O surface ions can spill over the metal particle and react with the
adsorbed H atoms to form H2O, leaving behind an O vacancy.31−33

In the absence of supported metal particles, the direct reduction
process ZrO2 + H2 → ZrO2–x + H2O is highly endothermic for extended
zirconia surfaces because of the low reactivity toward H2 and the high cost to create an O vacancy (∼6 eV12). Hofmann et al. found an enthalpy of +2.71
eV for the reduction reaction on the (101) surface of tetragonal zirconia
from density functional theory (DFT) Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) calculations.34 A higher value, +3.57
eV, has been found by our group using the PBE + U approach that improves the description of the zirconia band gap.
The process involves an energy barrier of 2.55 eV.35 The large enthalpy and energy barrier explain the experimental
observation that H2 desorption instead of H2O desorption takes place from the ZrO2 surface when the
hydroxylated Ru/ZrO2 system is heated to 370 K.36 This study follows other studies from our group
on the topic of zirconia NPs and related properties. We first analyzed
the general features and the electronic structure of zirconia NPs
of different sizes, elucidating the role of low coordinated ions and
the corresponding presence of new defect states in the band gap of
the material.7,8 In this work, we also considered
the cost of formation of oxygen vacancies via O2 desorption,
as this is a possible route to generate reduced samples. In a subsequent
study, we have considered metal adsorption on the ZrO2 NP,
in particular, the interaction of Au atoms and their ability to exchange
charge with the oxide support as a function of the particle size.37 In a third study, we considered H2 adsorption and dissociation, showing that zirconia NPs behave in
a completely different way compared to bulk zirconia as far as interaction
with hydrogen is concerned.21 In the present
study, the work has been extended toward another important topic:
the formation and desorption of water from hydrogenated ZrO2 NPs. In particular, we have investigated two steps of the reduction
process on zirconia NPs from both thermodynamic and kinetic points
of view. First, the H2 molecule is dissociated on the NP
surface (step I). Second, one H atom diffuses into the OH group to
form the OsH2 surface complex that is then desorbed
as H2O (step II).    

In addition, we have investigated the barriers for diffusion
of
the H atoms into distant adsorption sites, a process that contrast
the formation of an OsH2 surface complex. In
general, water desorption from a hydroxylated oxide surface is a viable
mechanism, leading to the reduction of an oxide. The present work
shows the relevant role of nanostructuring in favoring the process
that can result in substantial differences in the chemical behavior
of the same material when prepared in a bulk form or in the form of
nanostructures.

2 Computational Details
DFT-based calculations were performed with the Vienna Ab-Initio
Simulation Package (VASP 5.3),38,39 with plane waves as
basis sets with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 eV. The PBE exchange–correlation
functional, within the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), was
applied.40 The GGA + U approach implemented by Dudarev et al.41,42 was used to partly correct the self-interaction error intrinsic
in GGA functionals. An on-site Coulomb correction, Ueff = U – J,
was set to 4 eV for the 4d states of Zr atoms. This value provided
lattice parameters for tetragonal ZrO2: a0 = 3.662 Å and c0 =
5.223 Å, in good agreement with the experimental ones, 3.64 and
5.27 Å, respectively.43 The calculated
Kohn–Sham band gap, 4.5 eV, is still considerably smaller than
the experimental value 5.78 eV.44 The DFT
+ U approach is not free from limitations and should
be considered as a pragmatic way to partly remove the self-interaction
error inherent to DFT. Furthermore, U values depend
on coordination and might change during the transition-state search.
In this respect, the results presented in the following must be considered
as qualitative rather than quantitative. However, the main purpose
of this work is to compare, using the same approach, the properties
of zirconia in an extended or a nanostructured form. In this respect,
because some of the energies discussed for the two set of systems
differ substantially, the results and the general conclusions are
not expected to depend on the choice of the U parameter.

Long-range dispersion forces are included by means of the D2’
method45 on top of the PBE functional;
this is a slight modification of the original parametrization of the
D2 approach proposed by Grimme46 in which
we changed the parameters C6 and R0 of the DFT-D2 approach, as suggested by Tosoni
and Sauer.47

The (101) surface of
tetragonal ZrO2 was modeled with
a five-layer 3 × 2 supercell containing a total of 180 atoms
(Zr60O120). The lattice parameters were fixed
at the bulk t-ZrO2 optimized structure
obtained with a plane-wave basis set with a kinetic energy of up to
600 eV and with an 8 × 8 × 8 Monkhorst–Pack k-point grid. We modeled octahedral-based zirconia NPs with
compositions Zr16O32, Zr40O80, and Zr80O160 having diameters of 0.9, 1.5,
and 1.9 nm, respectively.7,8 The models were cut
from bulk tetragonal ZrO2, exhibiting {101} surfaces in
the octahedral facets and {100} surfaces in the cut corners, which
are the two most stable surfaces for this phase. The geometry optimizations
of both slab and NPs were carried out at the Γ-point, up to
ionic forces smaller than |0.05| eV/Å and a threshold of 10–5 eV for the electronic self-consistent cycles.

The reaction energy for the hydrogenation (step I) and water desorption
(step II) has been calculated according to 1   2  where E(H2ZrO2) is the energy
of the hydrogenated zirconia, E(ZrO2)
is the energy of clean zirconia, E(ZrO2–x) is the energy of zirconia
with one O vacancy, and E(H2,(g)) and E(H2O(g)) are the energies of H2 and H2O molecules in the gas phase, respectively.
The same equations are used to calculate the reaction Gibbs free energy,
ΔG, of the reaction steps. The free energies G(ZrO2) and G(ZrO2–x) are approximated to the PBE + U energy, and those for H2, H2O, and H2ZrO2 are defined according to 3   4  where
ZPE is the zero-point energy calculated
as (Σh̵νi)/2, for which
only O–H and Zr–H vibrations (ν) are considered, T is the temperature, and S is the total
entropy. In the G(H2ZrO2) term,
the vibrational internal energy, Uvib,
and the vibrational entropy, Svib, have
been neglected. This is justified because OH and ZrH vibrations, in
the range of 3000–3700 and 1400 cm–1, respectively,
yield Uvib and Svib terms on the order of 10–6 eV only. The
entropy of H2 and H2O molecules in the gas phase
is calculated as the sum of the translational, Strans, vibrational, Svib, and rotational, Srot, contributions according to eqs 5–7 5   6   7  where q is the partition
function, θ is the vibrational temperature (hν/kB), and I is
the inertia moment. At 298 K and 1 bar, our calculated entropies for
H2 and H2O, 131 and 189 J/mol·K, respectively,
perfectly agree with those reported in the literature.48

Finally, transition states are computed
by means of the nudged
elastic band method using the climbing image approach49 and fully characterized by pertinent vibrational analysis.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Thermodynamics of Hydrogenation
and Dehydration
of ZrO2 NPs
The first step of the reduction process
investigated is the adsorption and dissociation of a H2 molecule on the zirconia surface (hydrogenation). As mentioned above,
bulk ZrO2 and ZrO2 (101) surface are nonreducible.
The regular (101) surface dissociates the H2 molecule through
a heterolytic mechanism into H+ and H– ions, Figure 1a,
with a slightly exothermic process, −0.06 eV, Table 1. The Gibbs free energy for
the dissociation is endergonic at 298 K and 1 bar, with ΔGI = +0.34 eV, because of the entropy of H2 gas that hinders the adsorption and dissociation.

A completely
different situation is obtained on NPs. An important
aspect to consider in the study of ZrO2 NPs is how the
chosen structures are representative of real NPs. First of all, we
decided to consider three stoichiometric particles of different sizes:
Zr16O32, Zr40O80, and
Zr80O160. The work performed so far shows that
more than the size what counts are the morphological aspects and the
presence of low coordinated sites. In this respect, the smallest and
largest particles considered, Zr16O32 and Zr80O160, are electronically similar and behave differently
from the zirconia (101) surface, whereas the intermediate size Zr40O80 has a general behavior, which is reminiscent
of that of the bare zirconia surface. We modeled adsorption of the
two H atoms on next-neighbor Zr or O sites at the corners of the NPs
as these sites are expected to be more reactive because of their low
coordination. The dissociation of H2 on these sites is
largely exothermic, Table 1. The reaction energy of the hydrogenation step is −1.79,
−1.80, and −1.62 eV, respectively, on Zr80O160, Zr40O80, and Zr16O32 NPs, Table 1. We have recently reported such high reactivity of nanostructured
zirconia compared to extended flat and stepped zirconia surfaces (for
a more detailed description of this process, the reader is referred
to ref (20)). Zr80O160 and Zr16O32 split the
H2 molecule through a homolytic mechanism, which implies
the direct reduction of the oxide via formation of Zr3+ centers (Figure 1b,d) and adsorbed protons. The heterolytic dissociation is energetically
unfavorable compared to the homolytic process. On the contrary, Zr40O80 splits H2 heterolytically, as for
the regular (101) surface, with no reduction of the oxide (Figure 1c). In this case,
the homolytic process lies higher in energy. We attribute this difference
to the different shape, and consequently to the different electronic
structure, of the three NPs. In particular, the presence of low-lying
Zr 4d states in the energy gap of Zr80O160 and
Zr16O32, owing to the low coordinated Zr ions
at corners and edges (Figure 2b,d), favors the reduction of Zr4+ to Zr3+. By contrast, the energy gap of Zr40O80 (Figure 2c) does not exhibit
such defective states, in analogy with the (101) surface (Figure 2a). The exothermicity
of the hydrogenation on Zr40O80 comes from the
special structural flexibility that enhances its reactivity rather
than from electronic effects due to low coordination of the Zr ions.

surface, (b) Zr80O160, (c) Zr40O80, and (d) Zr16O32. The zero of energy
corresponds to the top of the valence states. The PDOS of O atoms
is indicated in gray and that of Zr atoms is indicated in blue.

The entropic terms also make the
H2 dissociation less
exergonic, resulting in Gibbs free energies of −1.19, −1.33,
and −1.01 eV on Zr80O160, Zr40O80, and Zr16O32, respectively.
Note that these values are qualitatively different from those corresponding
to the (101) surface, where the reaction has a positive ΔG, Table 1. In addition, the OH and ZrH stretching frequencies from both the
homolytic and heterolytic mechanisms are significantly blue-shifted
in the NPs (∼3700 cm–1) compared to those
on the regular (101) surface (∼3000 cm–1).
This can be attributed to longer OH and ZrH bonds in the (101) surface
due to an electrostatic attraction between the H+ and H– ions, Figure 1a.

The second step implies the desorption of a water
molecule from
the hydrogenated surface with the subsequent formation of an O vacancy
(dehydration). This process involves the diffusion of a H atom on
the surface and its binding to an OH group with the formation of an
OsH2 unit. In the (101) surface, this step has
an energy cost of 3.55 eV. In this case, a slightly lower Gibbs free
energy is obtained because the entropy of the H2O gas favors
desorption (3.28 eV at 298 K and 1 bar, Table 1), but the process remains significantly
endergonic. In the NPs, ΔGII is
also endergonic but considerably smaller, about 1.5 eV for both Zr80O160 and Zr16O32 (Table 1); on the contrary,
the cost remains high on Zr40O80 (ΔEII = 3.08 eV and ΔGII = 2.74 eV) where a heterolytic dissociation of hydrogen
has occurred, Table 1. The reduction of the energy cost comes from the stabilization of
the O vacancies in the NPs. In the (101) surface, the creation of
a vacancy costs around 6 eV with respect to the formation of 1/2O2,12 whereas in Zr80O160, Zr40O80, and Zr16O32, the cost is 2.77, 3.82, and 2.96 eV, respectively.7,8 It is important to note that the results show that the creation
of an O vacancy in ZrO2 by desorption of H2O
has a lower cost than via desorption of oxygen and formation of 1/2O2. This holds true for both NPs and surfaces.

From the
thermodynamic data, we have calculated the reaction conditions
at which the Gibbs free energy becomes negative (exergonic); hence,
the process becomes thermodynamically spontaneous. For that, we have
considered the entropy of the H2 and H2O gases
at different temperatures between 50 and 1600 K and for pressures
of 1 bar (ambient) and 10–12 bar (ultrahigh vacuum,
UHV) according to eqs 5–67. Thus, a trend
ΔG versus T is constructed
for each pressure and reaction step. The temperatures at which the
condition ΔG = 0 is satisfied are reported
in Table 2. For the
hydrogenation process, H2 dissociates spontaneously on
the (101) surface at 1 bar and below 70 K because of the low reactivity
of the extended zirconia toward H2 dissociation (for higher
temperatures, H2 desorption dominates). On the contrary,
the NPs can be hydrogenated at ambient pressure in a wide range of
temperatures, up to 800–900 K (Table 2) because of the high reactivity toward H2 (exergonic adsorption free energies of −1/–1.3
eV, Table 1). Above
this temperature range, the entropy contribution of H2 prevents
its adsorption to the surface and favors desorption.

The desorption of water from the heterolytically dissociated
2H/ZrO2 (101) surface at ambient pressure requires temperatures
above
1500 K because of the high endergonic character of the process (ΔGII = +3.28 eV) or above 800 K when the partial
pressure of water decreases to UHV conditions (10–12 bar). As in the initial hydrogenation step, NPs can undergo dehydration
at milder conditions compared to the regular surface. In particular,
water can start desorbing from the surface, creating an O vacancy
at temperatures above 450 K, a temperature at which several catalytic
processes involving oxides start to occur.6 In summary, NPs of zirconia can dissociate hydrogen and desorb water
at milder reaction conditions compared to the extended surface, changing
completely the landscape for the chemistry of these systems. In the
special case of zirconia, this leads a nonreducible oxide to become
reducible when prepared in a nanostructured form.

3.2 Kinetic Aspects (Energy Barriers)
In this section,
we investigate the complete reaction energy path,
from the adsorption of H2 to the formation and desorption
of H2O, including the reaction barriers. This can be divided
into two steps, as mentioned above. The first step involves the physisorption
of H2 followed by its dissociation (homo- or heterolytic);
the second step is the diffusion of hydrogen on the surface and the
formation of an OH2 surface complex; and the last step
is related to the desorption of H2O from the surface, leaving
behind an O vacancy.

First, on the ZrO2 (101) surface,
the H2 molecule is physisorbed with an energy of −0.11
eV; it dissociates heterolytically into H+ and H– species through a small energy barrier of 0.28 eV and a small binding
of −0.06 eV (see above). A similar barrier for the heterolytic
dissociation was recently published by our group (0.24 eV35). Experimentally, such a barrier has been estimated to be around
0.4 eV.50 To induce water desorption, the
H– ion must diffuse into the O–H+ group and form a OsH2 unit (this can also
be seen as a H2O molecule adsorbed on a surface O vacancy).
This process forces the system to become reduced. In fact, when the
two H atoms are bound to the same oxygen (OsH2 surface complex), the excess of charge is localized on two Zr3+ centers in a triplet state (Figure 3); it is the same configuration obtained
when two H atoms are adsorbed on two different oxygen sites, resulting
in a homolytic cleavage of the H–H bond (excited state). This
state is energetically highly unfavorable, and in fact, this process
is noncompetitive with respect to H2 desorption. Still,
it is a necessary step for water desorption. When the OsH2 surface complex is formed, two electrons are transferred
to two Zr ions (Zr3+). This is different from the case
of O-deficient zirconia (O vacancy) where electrons localize in the
vacancy and give rise to a singlet ground state (Figure 3) because of the morphological
change in the structure connected to the O removal. The formation
of the OsH2 complex on the regular surface by
H diffusion is thus highly endothermic, ΔE =
+2.79 eV, and the barrier is obviously even higher, 2.93 eV. A lower
barrier, 2.55 eV, has been reported in a previous study by our group
using a slightly different computational approach.35 Once the OsH2 surface complex is
formed, it desorbs with an energy cost of 0.72 eV. Therefore, the
highest barrier in the entire process is the diffusion of a H atom
to form a OsH2 precursor state of the desorbing
water molecule; neglecting prefactors, this is the rate-determining
step with a very high energy barrier, close to 3 eV. This process
will hardly occur on the bare zirconia surface as H2 desorption
is clearly preferred.

process from
the heterolytically hydrogenated ZrO2 (101) surface and
Zr40O80 and the homolytically hydrogenated Zr16O32 and Zr80O160 NPs. Zr:
blue atoms; O: red atoms; and H: white atoms. The spin density is
indicated in yellow (ρiso = 0.01 e–/Å3).

Now, we consider zirconia NPs where lower energy barriers
are expected
for the formation and desorption of the H2O molecule. In Figure 4, the reaction energy
profiles for the dehydration step from the hydrogenated NPs are compared
with those from the (101) surface. We did not study in detail the
physisorption and the barrier for dissociation of the H2 molecule, assuming that these values are not going to be very different
from the regular (101) surface (−0.11 and 0.28 eV, respectively).
In general, considering that the adsorption energies of H2 on the ZrO2 NPs are of −1.6/–1.8 eV, Table 1, the small changes
in H2 physisorption and barriers for dissociation when
the process is considered on zirconia NPs are not expected to play
a role in the whole process. The energy profiles reported are thus
starting from the hydrogenated surface.

Figure 4 Reaction energy profiles
for the dehydration step of the hydrogenated
2H/ZrO2 NPs (dashed line) and the extended 2H/ZrO2 (101) surface (solid line).

On the NPs, one H atom diffuses from the OH or the ZrH groups
to
another OH group, which can be two-coordinated or even single-coordinated,
as in Zr16O32 (Figure 1d). Also in this case, the overall NP–OsH2 complex assumes a triplet ground state with
two localized Zr3+ sites, Figure 3. Interestingly, the energy barrier decreases
from 2.93 eV on the extended surface to 1.77 eV in Zr80O160 NPs and to 1.83 eV in Zr16O32 NPs. This is a very significant reduction of more than 1 eV. It
has the important consequence that H diffusion competes with H2 desorption, differently from the bare surface. The subsequent
desorption of H2O has a cost of 0.85 eV in Zr80O160 and 1.11 eV in Zr16O32. Thus,
also on the NPs, the highest barrier is not associated with the water
desorption but rather with the hydrogen diffusion and with the formation
of the precursor state. Despite the large decrease in the barrier,
this does not reach the low value found for TiO2, a typical
reducible oxide, where the barrier for a similar process has been
estimated to be around 0.3 eV.33

Things are partly different for the Zr40O80 NP. We have seen above that on this NP the thermodynamics for the
reduction reaction is similar to that of the (101) surface because
of a similar electronic structure with the absence of defective states
in the band gap (Figure 2c). Accordingly, the reaction energy path for the dehydration of
2H/Zr40O80 has some resemblance with that of
the extended surface; the energy cost to form the OsH2 precursor is lower (2.24 eV) because of the higher structural
flexibility of the nanostructure, and so is the barrier (2.27 eV).
From this state, water desorbs to the gas phase with a cost of 0.84
eV. Thus, also in this case, the highest barrier is associated with
hydrogen diffusion. The barrier is considerably lower than that on
the regular surface (2.27 vs 2.93 eV) but still much larger than those
on the other two zirconia NPs considered (about 1.8 eV) where the
mechanism of H2 dissociation is different.

These
results show the positive effect of nanostructuring on the
reducibility of zirconia by water removal. The special fluxionality
of the NPs contributes to lowering not only the energy costs but also
the energy barriers involved in the process, thanks to a larger atomic
relaxation around the created O vacancy. This structural flexibility
is much smaller or even absent in bulk ZrO2 and ZrO2 surface. However, comparing the different behaviors of Zr80O160 and Zr16O32 NPs with
that of Zr40O80 NPs, one can conclude that the
key factor is the presence of low-lying acceptor states introduced
in the electronic structure by low coordinated Zr sites in corners
and edges, which strongly depends on the morphology of the NP.

There is a final aspect that needs to be discussed and that, once
more, shows a different behavior for the extended zirconia surface
compared to that of the NPs. We are referring to the process for H
diffusion on the hydrogenated surface. In the initial state, the two
H atoms remain adsorbed on vicinal sites (e.g., a Zr and an O ion,
in the case of heterolytic splitting). On the ZrO2 (101)
surface, the displacement of H+ and H– ions to more distant O and Zr sites has an energy cost of 0.64 and
0.73 eV, respectively, and it implies to overcome a barrier of 1.50
(H+) and 1.42 (H–) eV, Table 3. The fact that separating the
two species has a relatively high energy cost is due to their opposite
charges. The barrier is sufficiently high that, at low H2 pressure, molecular desorption rather than diffusion is expected.
This means that the formation of the OsH2 surface
complex is a rather unlikely event on the bare (101) ZrO2 surface.

Distant from the OH+ Precursor for the H2O Formation
support	 	ΔEdiff (eV)	ΔE⧧ (eV)	
ZrO2 (101)	OH+ to O′	0.64	1.50	
 	ZrH– to
Zr′	0.73	1.42	
Zr80O160	O2cH+ to O3c	0.69	1.73

Zr16O32	O2cH+ to O2c	0.06	1.72	
 	O2cH+ to O3c	0.50	1.54	
Things
are different for the NPs. In Zr80O160 and Zr16O32, the diffusion of one of the H+ species into an O site on one facet costs 0.69 and 0.50 eV,
respectively, depending on the coordination number of the O atom.
Despite the fact that two positive charges are separated, the proton
goes from an O2c site in the corner to a less reactive
O3c in the facet, with a concomitant decrease in stability.
On Zr16O32, where the diffusion involves two
O2c corner sites, the cost is 0.06 eV only. For the same
reason, in Zr40O80, the diffusion costs 0.84
and 0.24 eV for H+ and H– ions moving
to different O and Zr sites in the facet, respectively. The barrier
for diffusion on the NPs is rather high, on the order of 1.5–2
eV, not very different from what was calculated for the bare (101)
surface. However, on the NPs, this energy barrier is comparable to
that required to form the OsH2 surface complex,
suggesting that here the hydrogen diffusion and water desorption become
competitive processes.

4 Conclusions
We have
performed, by means of DFT-based calculations with the
PBE + U exchange–correlation functional and
D2’ dispersion, a comparative study of the reduction reaction
ZrO2 + H2 → ZrO2–x + H2O in nanostructured zirconia and
in the regular (101) surface. This has been separated into two steps:
hydrogenation of the surface (step I) and subsequent removal of a
water molecule with the formation of an O vacancy (step II).

Because of the low reducibility of ZrO2, the reduction
process of the extended (101) surface is unfavorable, with energies
ΔEI = −0.06 eV (ΔGI = 0.34 eV) and ΔEII = 3.55 eV (ΔGII = 3.28
eV). Zirconia NPs are more reactive, resulting in significantly lower
reaction energies, ΔEI = −1.6
to −1.8 eV (ΔGI = −1
to −1.2 eV) and ΔEII = 2–3
eV (ΔGII = 1.5–2.7 eV), because
of their special structural flexibility and electronic structure.
In a real system, there will be a random distribution of Zr3+ ions on the surface of the NPs. The disorder introduced by this
distribution of sites will provide a configurational entropy contribution
that is going to provide an extra stabilization for the reduced NPs
compared to the bare surface.

However, the mechanism for H2 splitting is determined
by the electronic structure. On the (101) surface, H2 is
dissociated heterolytically (formation of OH+ and ZrH– species). On Zr80O160 and Zr16O32 NPs, the presence of low-lying Zr 4d acceptor
states from low coordinated Zr ions at corners and edges favors the
homolytic H2 splitting, which implies the direct reduction
of the oxide (formation of two OH+ species and two Zr3+ centers). By contrast, such states are not present in Zr40O80 where the H2 molecule dissociates
heterolytically as on the (101) surface. This demonstrates that not
only the dimensions of the NPs count but also their shape and surface
morphology.

From the thermodynamic data, we conclude that the
hydrogenation
reaction at ambient pressure (1 bar) can be performed at any temperature
up to 900 K on the NPs, whereas on the (101) surface, it is possible
only below 70 K (the competitive mechanism is H2 desorption).

For the dehydration step, the energy barrier to form a H2O molecule on the hydrogenated surface decreases from 2.93 eV on
the (101) surface to 2.27 in Zr40O80 (which
is more “bulklike”) and to 1.77 and 1.83 eV in Zr80O160 and Zr16O32, respectively.
As a consequence, under UHV conditions, the dehydration of the hydrogenated
(101) surface requires temperatures above 800 K, whereas on the NPs,
it is possible above 450 K, a typical reaction temperature in many
catalytic processes. The results presented refer to the cases where
only one H2 molecule has been adsorbed on the surface of
the zirconia NPs. However, under working conditions, the particle
will be fully hydrogenated, and coverage effects will play a role.
In particular, we expect lower barriers for hydrogen migration to
form the OsH2 surface complex; also, the presence
of excess electrons due to the high hydrogen coverage can facilitate
water desorption. In general, this work shows the importance of nanostructuring
for the chemistry of oxides as this completely modifies the oxide
reducibility.
