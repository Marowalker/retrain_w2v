In this work, a comparative
study on the supramolecular assemblies
formed by calixpyridinium and two alginates with different viscosities
was performed. We found that sodium alginate (SA) with medium viscosity
(SA-M) had a better capability to induce aggregation of calixpyridinium
in comparison with SA with low viscosity (SA-L) because of the stronger
electrostatic interactions between calixpyridinium and SA-M. Therefore,
the morphology of calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates
was a compact spherical structure, while that of calixpyridinium–SA-L
supramolecular aggregates was an incompact lamellar structure. As
a result, adding much more amount of 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic acid
tetrasodium salt to calixpyridinium–SA-M solution was required
to achieve the balance of the competitive binding, and in comparison
with calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular aggregates, calixpyridinium–SA-M
supramolecular aggregates were more sensitive to alkali. However,
for the same reason, in comparison with calixpyridinium–SA-M
supramolecular aggregates, calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular
aggregates were much more stable in water not only at room temperature
but also at a higher temperature, and even in salt solution. Therefore,
in comparison with calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular aggregates,
calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates exhibited a
completely opposite response to acid because of the generation of
salt. Because SA is an important biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility,
it is anticipated that this comparative study is extremely important
in constructing functional supramolecular biomaterials.

1 Introduction
Self-assembly
phenomena are ubiquitous in many fields, such as
materials science, chemistry, and biology.1 Nature has provided many cases that well elucidate this concept,
for example, membrane structures in the endoplasmic reticulum and
stem cells.2 The assembled structures can
be precisely controlled by the ingenious design of the building units.3 In this context, the construction of well-defined
nanoscaled or microscaled structures based on molecular self-assembly
remains a key challenge facing modern chemistry. So far, many noncovalent
interactions, such as π···π, charge-transfer,
and hydrogen-bonding interactions, among others,4 have been widely applied in fabricating different kinds
of structured aggregates via molecular self-assembly, including fibers,
vesicles, tubules, disks, and micelles.5 However, these commonly used intermolecular interactions are not
always effective in pure water. As a result, most of these assemblies
lack the necessary biocompatibility for applications in biological,
medical, and environmental arenas. The host–guest interactions
based on macrocycles, for example, p-sulfonatocalixarenes,
modified-pillararenes, cyclodextrins, and cucurbiturils, occur usually
in water.6 Consequently, the host–guest
interactions based on macrocyclic receptors are particularly advantageous
in fabricating water-soluble assemblies.7 It is noted that most of these frequently used macrocyclic receptors
are perfect hosts for cationic guests. The construction of water-soluble
assemblies through the anionic recognition of macrocyclic receptors
has been explored much less frequently because the recognition of
anions in water remains a key challenge in modern supramolecular chemistry.8 In fact, anionic species are very important because
of their biological and environmental relevance.9

Positively charged calixpyridinium, obtained by the
intermolecular
cyclization of 3-bromomethylpyridine,10 is water-soluble. Moreover, this cationic macrocyclic receptor has
exhibited good inclusion/complexation properties for anionic guests.
Shinoda et al. first studied the host–guest interactions between
calixpyridinium and tricarboxylate anions in 1998, and they found
that the geometry of the three carboxyl groups in guests is the key
factor for determining the affinity and selectivity of host–guest
complexation.10 Atilgan and Akkaya provided
the first case of applying macrocyclic calixpyridinium in fluorescence
sensing of anions by the indicator displacement method in 2004, and
they found that the affinities of calixpyridinium for anionic guests
were determined by the total negative charges of anionic species.9a In 2016, we fabricated a novel reporter pair
based on calixpyridinium in supramolecular tandem assay for continuous
and real-time monitoring of alkaline phosphatase activity by taking
advantage of the selective binding of calixpyridinium toward anionic
adenosine triphosphate and its hydrolysis products catalyzed by alkaline
phosphatase.11 In 2017, we found the highly
selective binding of calixpyridinium toward acidic amino acids in
aqueous media, and the electrostatic interactions between positively
charged calixpyridinium and anionic acidic amino acids are the main
driving forces.12 Although calixpyridinium
has exhibited good binding ability to anionic guests, the construction
of water-soluble supramolecular assemblies via the anionic recognition
of calixpyridinium has been explored much less frequently. Last year,
we fabricated the first supramolecular assembly based on the anionic
recognition of calixpyridinium, in which native biocompatible polysaccharide
hyaluronan was employed as the guest.13 Recently, we successfully constructed another calixpyridinium-based
supramolecular assembly employing polyanionic chondroitin 4-sulfate
as the guest.14 Compared with calixpyridinium–hyaluronan
assembly, the stability of calixpyridinium–chondroitin 4-sulfate
assembly is better because of the stronger electrostatic interactions
between the host and the guest originating from the higher negative
charge density on the side chain of chondroitin 4-sulfate.

Alginic
acid, produced by some bacteria and brown algae, such as Azotobacter- and Pseudomonas species,15 is a naturally occurring linear
polyuronic acid. Sodium alginate (SA), the sodium salt of alginic
acid, has attracted more and more attention of researchers16 because it is a very important biomaterial with
good biocompatibility. However, up to now, supramolecular material
constructed via the host–guest interactions of macrocyclic
receptors with SA has been explored much less frequently. Herein,
we report a comparative study on the supramolecular assemblies formed
by calixpyridinium and two alginates with different viscosities (Scheme 1), SA with low viscosity
(SA-L) and SA with medium viscosity (SA-M). It is anticipated that
this comparative study is extremely important, not only in further
understanding the assembling mechanism of the calixpyridinium receptor
with polyanion, but also in constructing functional supramolecular
biomaterials.

2 Results
and Discussion
The optical transmittance of different concentrations
of SA solution
was first detected to measure the critical aggregation concentration
(CAC) of polysaccharide SA because pure SA may self-aggregate in water
(Figure S1). As shown in Figure S1a, increasing the concentration of SA-L from 0.05
to 0.20 mg/mL could not lead to any change in its optical transmittance
over 350 nm. With the addition of more SA-L (from 0.20 to 2.01 mg/mL),
its optical transmittance over 350 nm began to decrease gradually
because of the turbidity generated by the aggregation of SA-L. The
CAC value of pure SA-L (0.74 mg/mL) could therefore be measured by
observing the inflection point on the plot of the optical transmittance
at 350 nm of SA-L versus their concentrations (Figure 1a). A similar experimental phenomenon was
observed for SA-M (Figure S1b), and the
obtained CAC value of pure SA-M (0.68 mg/mL) was also quite similar
to that of pure SA-L (Figure 1b), suggesting that free SA with different viscosities has
similar aggregation ability.

Figure 1 Dependence of the optical transmittance (at
350 nm) of (a) SA-L
and (b) SA-M in water vs their concentrations.

Next, we added calixpyridinium gradually to a solution of
SA-L
at a fixed concentration that is far lower than its CAC, and we found
that the addition of a small quantity of calixpyridinium could not
lead to any change in its optical transmittance over 350 nm. With
the addition of more calixpyridinium, its optical transmittance over
350 nm began to decrease sharply because of the turbidity generated
by polyanionic SA-L-complexation-induced aggregation of cationic calixpyridinium
(Figure S2). The SA-L-complexation-induced
CAC value of calixpyridinium could therefore be measured by observing
the inflection point on the plot of the optical transmittance at 350
nm of calixpyridinium versus their concentrations (Figure 2): 13.4 μM at 13 μg/mL
SA-L, 22.5 μM at 24 μg/mL SA-L, 39.2 μM at 50 μg/mL
SA-L, 52.1 μM at 70 μg/mL SA-L, 56.3 μM at 96 μg/mL
SA-L, and 63.5 μM at 120 μg/mL SA-L. Moreover, we found
that SA-L complexation-induced CAC values of calixpyridinium increased
linearly with SA-L concentrations in a certain concentration range
(Figure 3). Similar
experimental phenomena were observed for SA-M (Figures S3 and S4), but the CAC values of calixpyridinium
induced by the complexation of SA-M were a little lower than those
induced by the complexation of SA-L: 12.6 μM at 13 μg/mL
SA-M, 17.0 μM at 24 μg/mL SA-M, 27.9 μM at 50 μg/mL
SA-M, 41.4 μM at 70 μg/mL SA-M, 47.4 μM at 96 μg/mL
SA-M, and 47.6 μM at 120 μg/mL SA-M, implying that SA-M
had a better capability to induce aggregation of calixpyridinium.
It is noted that free calixpyridinium cannot self-aggregate in water
(Figure S5).

Figure 2 Dependence of the optical
transmittance (at 350 nm) of calixpyridinium
in water vs their concentrations in the presence of 13 (a), 24 (b),
50 (c), 70 (d), 96 (e), and 120 μg/mL (f) SA-L.

Figure 3 Linear relationship between the CAC values of calixpyridinium
and
the concentrations of SA-L in water.

Because different concentrations of SA can all induce aggregation
of calixpyridinium, it is necessary to study the best mixing ratio
of calixpyridinium and SA for forming calixpyridinium–SA binary
supramolecular aggregates. We added SA-L gradually to a solution of
calixpyridinium at a fixed concentration of 55 μM. We found
that the addition of SA-L first led to a sharp decrease of its optical
transmittance over 350 nm because of the turbidity generated by polyanionic
SA-L-complexation-induced aggregation of cationic calixpyridinium,
and with the addition of excess SA-L, its optical transmittance over
350 nm began to increase gradually because of the disassembly of the
aggregates, which is more favorable for the entropy term (Figure S6a). The best concentration of SA-L (50
μg/mL) for the formation of calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular
aggregates could therefore be measured by observing the inflection
point on the plot of the optical transmittance at 350 nm of SA-L versus
their concentrations (Figure 4a). A similar experimental phenomenon was observed for SA-M
(Figure S6b), but the obtained best concentration
of SA-M (40 μg/mL) is a little lower than that of SA-L for the
formation of calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates
when the concentration of calixpyridinium is also fixed at 55 μM
(Figure 4b), which
again implied that SA-M had a better capability to induce aggregation
of calixpyridinium. Further studies on the supramolecular assemblies
between calixpyridinium and SA were based on these ratios. It is noted
that 1-methylpyridinium (the building subunit of calixpyridinium)
and SA cannot form supramolecular aggregates (Figure S7), implying that the cyclic structure of the host
is also a key factor for the construction of calixpyridinium–SA
supramolecular aggregates.

Figure 4 Dependence of the optical transmittance (at
350 nm) of (a) SA-L
and (b) SA-M in water vs their concentrations with a fixed calixpyridinium
concentration of 55 μM.

The stability of calixpyridinium–SA supramolecular
aggregates
was further studied at room and higher temperatures. As can be seen
from Figure 5a, there
was no appreciable change in the transmittance spectra of calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution over 7 days at room temperature. Moreover, the optical transmittance
could not be disturbed either by centrifuging the calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution for 1 min at 3000 rpm (Figure 6a), or by increasing the temperature of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution up to 80 °C (Figure 7a). All of these experimental results indicate that
calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular aggregates have sufficient
stability not only at room temperature but also at a higher temperature.
However, as can be seen from Figure 5b, there was an obvious change in the transmittance
spectra of calixpyridinium–SA-M solution after only 24 h. Moreover,
the optical transmittance was seriously disturbed either by centrifuging
the calixpyridinium–SA-M solution (Figure 6b), or by increasing the temperature of the
calixpyridinium–SA-M solution (Figure 7b). All of these experimental results reflect
that in comparison with calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular
aggregates, calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates
are much less stable not only at room temperature but also at a higher
temperature. The surface charge distribution of calixpyridinium–SA
supramolecular aggregates was further identified by using zeta potential
measurement, giving an average zeta potential of 12.98 for calixpyridinium–SA-L
supramolecular aggregates and 10.33 for calixpyridinium–SA-M
supramolecular aggregates. The little higher zeta potential of calixpyridinium–SA-L
supramolecular aggregates also supported the fact that SA-L could
form more stable supramolecular aggregates with calixpyridinium in
water.

It is well-known that the stability
of the assembly driven by electrostatic
interactions would be affected by salt. Therefore, the stability of
calixpyridinium–SA supramolecular aggregates in NaCl solution
was further studied. As shown in Figure 8a, when the concentration of NaCl was increased
from 0 to 15 mM, the optical transmittance of calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution was almost unchanged, implying that calixpyridinium–SA-L
supramolecular aggregates were even quite stable in NaCl solution.
However, as can be seen from Figure 8b, there was an obvious increase in the optical transmittance
of calixpyridinium–SA-M solution with the concentration of
NaCl increased from 0 to 15 mM as a result of the disassembly of the
aggregates, indicating that calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular
aggregates were more affected by salt in comparison with calixpyridinium–SA-L
supramolecular aggregates. One reasonable explanation is that SA-M
possesses more negative charges than SA-L, and therefore affords stronger
electrostatic interactions with calixpyridinium, which is less stable
in water and more affected by salt. The stronger electrostatic interactions
between SA-M and calixpyridinium also explain well why SA-M has a
better capability to induce aggregation of calixpyridinium.

(b) assemblies at different concentrations of NaCl solution. [Calixpyridinium]
= 55 μM, [SA-L] = 50 μg/mL, and [SA-M] = 40 μg/mL.

It has been proved that calixpyridinium
and 1,3,6,8-pyrenetetrasulfonic
acid tetrasodium salt (PyTS) can form a stable complex in water.11 On the basis of that, next we would like to
explore the disassembly of the calixpyridinium–SA supramolecular
aggregates driven by the competitive binding of PyTS with calixpyridinium.
As was expected, with the gradual addition of PyTS, there was a gradual
increase in the optical transmittance of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution over 425 nm because of the disassembly of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
aggregates (Figure S8a), and as shown in Figure 9a, only ca. 3 equiv
of PyTS was needed to achieve the balance of this competitive binding.
A similar experimental phenomenon was observed for SA-M (Figure S8b). However, much more amount of PyTS
(ca. 32 equiv) was required to achieve the balance of this competitive
binding (Figure 9b),
although the binding constant between calixpyridinium and PyTS is
high up to 106 M–1,11 which also implies the stronger electrostatic interactions
of SA-M with calixpyridinium.

Figure 9 Dependence of the optical transmittance of calixpyridinium–SA-L
(a) and calixpyridinium–SA-M (b) assemblies at 450 nm on the
concentration ratio of PyTS and calixpyridinium. [Calixpyridinium]
= 55 μM, [SA-L] = 50 μg/mL, and [SA-M] = 40 μg/mL.

The responsiveness of calixpyridinium–SA
supramolecular
aggregates to acid and alkali was further studied because both calixpyridinium
and SA could be affected by the pH value. As can be seen from Figure 10a, increasing pH
from 6 to 7 could not lead to an obvious change in the optical transmittance
of the calixpyridinium–SA-L solution over 700 nm, and further
increasing pH to 9 would lead to a dramatic increase in the optical
transmittance over 700 nm because of the disassembly of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
aggregates, which was also proven by the obvious reduction of the
turbidity and Tyndall effect (Figure 11). A reasonable explanation for the disassembly of
the calixpyridinium–SA-L aggregates under alkaline condition
is that the methylene bridges in calixpyridinium are acidic,9a which would be deprotonated under alkaline condition
(Figure S9) and therefore result in a weaker
electrostatic interaction of calixpyridinium to SA-L because of the
reduced positive charge of calixpyridinium from protonated to deprotonated
state.14 Similar experimental phenomenon
was observed for SA-M, but only increasing pH from 6 to 7 would lead
to a dramatic increase in the optical transmittance of the calixpyridinium–SA-M
solution over 700 nm (Figure 10b). It is reasonable because the electrostatic interaction
between calixpyridinium and SA-M is stronger in comparison with calixpyridinium
and SA-L, which is more affected by the reduced positive charge of
calixpyridinium with increasing the pH value.

of the aqueous solutions of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
(a) and calixpyridinium–SA-M (b) assemblies at different pH
values. [Calixpyridinium] = 55 μM, [SA-L] = 50 μg/mL,
and [SA-M] = 40 μg/mL.

Figure 11 Photos showing the turbidity (a) and Tyndall effect (b) of the
calixpyridinium–SA-L solution at pH = 6 and pH = 9 at room
temperature in water. [Calixpyridinium] = 55 μM, [SA-L] = 50
μg/mL.

On the contrary, as
can be seen from Figure 12a, decreasing pH from 6 to 4 would lead
to a dramatic decrease in the optical transmittance of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
solution, accompanied by a stronger turbidity and the Tyndall effect
(Figure S10). One possible explanation
for this phenomenon is that the acid radical ions in SA-L would be
partially protonated under acidic conditions (Figure S11), which leads to a different supramolecular aggregate
formed by calixpyridinium and partially protonated SA-L.14 However, a completely opposite experimental
phenomenon was observed for SA-M. Decreasing pH from 6 to 4 would
lead to a little increase in the optical transmittance of the calixpyridinium–SA-M
solution (Figure 12b). One possible explanation is that we have proven that calixpyridinium–SA-M
supramolecular aggregates are more affected by salt in comparison
with calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular aggregates, and therefore,
generating NaCl with the addition of HCl would lead to a small amount
of disassembly of the calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates.

Figure 12 Optical
transmittance of the aqueous solutions of the calixpyridinium–SA-L
(a) and calixpyridinium–SA-M (b) assemblies at different pH
values. [Calixpyridinium] = 55 μM, [SA-L] = 50 μg/mL,
and [SA-M] = 40 μg/mL.

As shown in Figures 13 and S12, a simple mixture of calixpyridinium
and SA showed the Tyndall effect and turbidity, revealing that the
complexation of calixpyridinium with SA could form abundant nanoparticles.
However, free calixpyridinium and SA solutions could not show the
similar phenomena, indicating that free calixpyridinium and SA could
not self-aggregate under the same conditions. High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) were
then employed to characterize the structure and size of the supramolecular
aggregates formed by calixpyridinium and SA. The TEM image showed
that the morphology of calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular
aggregates was an incompact lamellar structure (Figure 14a), and DLS examination gave
an average diameter of 233.6 nm (Figure 15a), while the morphology of calixpyridinium–SA-M
supramolecular aggregates was a compact spherical structure (Figure 14b), and therefore
DLS examination gave a little smaller average diameter of 221.2 nm
(Figure 15b), which
was also in accordance with the abovementioned results that SA-M had
a better capability to induce aggregation of calixpyridinium in comparison
with SA-L because of the stronger electrostatic interactions of SA-M
with calixpyridinium.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, we have performed a comparative study on the supramolecular
assemblies formed by calixpyridinium and two alginates with different
viscosities (SA-L and SA-M). We found that SA-M had a better capability
to induce aggregation of calixpyridinium because of the stronger electrostatic
interactions of SA-M with calixpyridinium. Therefore, the morphology
of calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular aggregates was a compact
spherical structure, while that of calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular
aggregates was an incompact lamellar structure. However, for the same
reason, in comparison with calixpyridinium–SA-M supramolecular
aggregates, calixpyridinium–SA-L supramolecular aggregates
were much more stable in water not only at room temperature but also
at a higher temperature, and even in salt solution. Because SA is
an important biomaterial with excellent biocompatibility, it is anticipated
that this comparative study is extremely important, not only in further
understanding the assembling process of calixpyridinium with polyanions,
but also in constructing functional supramolecular biomaterials.
