Various organic impurities (starting
materials, reagents, intermediates,
degradation products, by-products, and side products) could be present
in active pharmaceutical ingredients affecting their qualities, safeties,
and efficacies. Herein, we present the efficient syntheses of two
United States Pharmacopeia impurities of an antidiabetic drug sitagliptin,
a potent and orally active dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor: 3-desamino-2,3-dehydrositagliptin
and 3-desamino-3,4-dehydrositagliptin. Our three-step synthetic approach
is based on the efficient cobalt-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction
of 1-bromo-2,4,5-trifluorobenzene and methyl 4-bromocrotonate in the
first step, followed by hydrolysis of corresponding ester with 3 M
HCl to (E)-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-enoic acid
in high overall yield, whereas the reaction with 3 M NaOH resulted
in the carbon–carbon double bond regio-isomerization and hydrolysis
to give the (E)-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-3-enoic
acid in 92% yield. Both acid derivatives were converted to title compounds
via the amide bond formation with 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazine. Extensive screening of coupling/activation reagents,
bases, and solvents reviled that the amide bond is formed the most
efficiently using the (COCl)2/Et3N in THF or
alternatively EDC/NMM/(DMAP or HOBt) in DMF obtaining the title compounds
in 68–76% yields and providing the overall yields for the three-step
process in the range of 57–64% on a gram scale. The presented
study also demonstrates the importance of a proper selection of solvent,
base, and coupling/activating reagent for amide bond formation using
Michael acceptor-type allylbenzene derivatives as coupling partners
to minimize the carbon–carbon double bond regio-isomerization.

Introduction
Sitagliptin ((3R)-3-amino-1-(3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6-dihydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7(8H)-yl)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-1-one
(1), Figure 1) is a potent and orally active dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4)
inhibitor discovered by Merck.1 After the
approval by FDA in 2006, it has been used for the treatment of diabetes
mellitus type 2 under the brand name Januvia.2 Sitagliptin is the most important drug in the class of DPP-4 inhibitors
or even among antidiabetes drugs overall with a market value of more
than US$ 11.4 billion in 2018 (US$ 7.5 billion for monoproduct and
US$ 3.9 billion for fixed-dose combination with metformin; IQVIA Analytics
Link data).

Figure 1 Sitagliptin (1) and its main impurities 2–10.

The majority of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are produced
by organic syntheses; therefore, various organic impurities such as
starting materials, reagents, intermediates, by-products, and side
products could be present in the API. Furthermore, some impurities
are also formed during the degradation process under storage conditions.3 Impurity profile studies are thus essential to
ensure purity, quality, safety, and efficacy during API development.3−5 In the case of sitagliptin, small quantities of degradation impurities
or related substances may have an impact on its antidiabetic activity
and may be potentially toxic. Therefore, based on the value of sitagliptin
in diabetes treatment, it is of huge importance that the quality of
the drug is properly controlled using high quality analytical standards
of impurities.5m Up to date, several structurally
diverse impurities of sitagliptin were reported in the literature
and pharmacopeia (Figure 1)4,6−8 such as the 1-phenylethyl
derivative of sitagliptin 2 and 3-(trifluoromethyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazine (3) as intermediates in the manufacturing
process, a recently reported 1-cyclohexylethyl derivative of sitagliptin 4 and enantiomer impurity 5, which are side reaction
products generated during the catalytic hydrogenation in the final
step of sitagliptin synthesis.4 Other impurities
reported as sitagliptin intermediates and/or degradation products
are enamine impurity 6, acid impurity 7,
triazole derivative 8, and two alkene derivatives 9 (3-desamino-2,3-dehydrositagliptin; also known as United
States Pharmacopeia (USP) sitagliptin phenylcrotonyl analogue impurity)
and 10 (3-desamino-3,4-dehydrositagliptin; also known
as UPS sitagliptin styrylacetyl analogue impurity). Compounds 9 and 10 are specified impurities with limits
of NMT 0.2% in the United States Pharmacopeia monograph for sitagliptin
tablets.8 Acid impurity 7 was
reported as a product of hydrolysis4 as
well as a degradation product,6,7a whereas impurities 8–10 are degradation related impurities
(DRIs) that occur as a result of the degradation processes.6,7a Furthermore, alkene impurity 9 is also a process-related
impurity formed by acid-catalyzed elimination of amine during the
hydrogenolysis reaction.4

Some synthetic
routes for impurities 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9,
and 10 were reported in the scientific4,9 and
patent10−15 literatures, whereas recently identified cyclohexyl impurity 4 was synthesized by Bandichhor and co-authors.4 Interestingly, synthesis of impurity 9 was reported mainly starting from sitagliptin or late stage intermediates,4,10 while only one four-step synthetic procedure from 2,4,5-trifluorophenylacetic
acid was reported in a Chinese patent application.12 Furthermore, two additional steps are needed if 2,4,5-trifluorophenylacetic
acid is prepared from readily available 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene.16 Similarly, the synthesis of alkene impurity 10 was mentioned only in the patent literature;11,14,15 however, the starting materials
were only late stage sitagliptin intermediates or sitagliptin. The
aim of our study was thus to develop an efficient and straightforward
synthetic route to alkene impurity 10 from a simple,
readily available, and cheap starting material. Furthermore, we also
considered the preparation of alkene impurity 9 by developing
a novel, concise, and high-yielding procedure.

Results and Discussion
According to the context described above, our goal was to develop
the most convenient synthetic routes to alkene impurities 9 and 10 from readily available starting materials such
as fluorinated benzene derivatives. In light of our previous studies17,18 where we presented two synthetic approaches using cobalt- or iron-catalyzed
cross-coupling reaction, we decided to use the cobalt-catalyzed reaction
for the preparation of methyl (E)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-enoate
(12) as our key intermediate.18 It was synthesized in a one-step reaction from 1-bromo-2,4,5-trifluorobenzene
(11), which was converted to the corresponding arylmagnesium
bromide using isopropylmagnesium chloride as a Grignard exchange reagent.
After, aryl Grignard reagent reacted further with methyl 4-bromocrotonate
under cobalt-catalyzed cross-coupling reaction to obtain methyl (E)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-enoate (12) in a 91% yield on a 17 g scale (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Our Synthetic Approach for Preparation
of Alkene Impurities I (9) and II (10) via
the Intermediate 12
Our first attempt to develop a synthetic route to alkene impurity 10 from methyl (E)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-enoate
(12) was to perform regio-isomerization of allylbenzene
intermediate 12 to the regio-isomerized product 13 (Scheme 1). Previous studies have indicated that bases, such as NH3,19 LiOtBu,20 LiHMDS,21 K2CO3,22,23 KF,24−26 KOH,25 and KOtBu,25,27 can promote the regio-isomerization of the allylbenzene derivative.
Accordingly, the conversion of 12 to 13 in
the presence of different bases (NaH, Et3N, NMM, and DBU)
was monitored by NMR (see the Supporting Information, Table S1). The results revealed that the best
ratio of 12/13 was 0.23:1, which was obtained
with NMM (10 equiv.) after a 72-h reaction time (Table S1, entry 9). Additionally, the use of NaOH as a base
was also examined; however, regio-isomerization along with the hydrolysis
of methyl ester occurred. Nevertheless, acid 14 was obtained
in high yield (Table 1), which prompted us to synthesize the alkene impurity 10 by using the coupling reaction between the acid 14 and
amine 3. On the other hand, the acid-catalyzed hydrolysis
led only to unisomerized acid 15 (Table 1). Therefore, we decided to incorporate hydrolysis
of methyl ester 12 to corresponding acids 15 and 14 for the syntheses of both alkene impurities 9 and 10, respectively.

c NR: no reaction occurred, only 12 detected.

In
a continuation of our study, we optimized the hydrolysis of
methyl ester 12 to acids 14 and 15 with regard to the reaction time, temperature, and amount of base
used (Table 1). In
the case of NaOH, the main challenge was to obtain fully regio-isomerized
acid 14 without the presence of unisomerized acid 15 or unhydrolyzed regio-isomerized methyl ester 13. A prolonged reaction time and low molarity of NaOH did not circumvent
this problem (Table 1, entries 1–3). Increasing the molarities of used NaOH to
1 and 3 M provided better selectivity and lowered the formation of 15 and 13 (Table 1, entries 4–8). Furthermore, heating and a shorter
reaction time also did not improve the ratio (Table 1, entry 10). In the end, the optimal reaction
conditions were obtained when methyl ester 12 was hydrolyzed
up to 90% with 3 M NaOH in 24 or 72 h (Table 1, entries 7 and 8). On the other hand, almost
complete hydrolysis to 15 occurred by refluxing with
3 M HCl (Table 1, entry
13), whereas no product 15 was detected at room temperature
(Table 1, entries 11 and 12). To sum up, acid-catalyzed hydrolysis
led to almost quantitative conversion of ester 12 to
acid 15, whereas in basic condition hydrolysis of an
ester 12 concomitant with regio-isomerization reaction
to acid 14 occurred. However, regio-isomerization did
not occur quantitatively (the most optimal ratio was 1:0.10 as shown
in Table 1, entry 8)
despite the use of concentrated basic solutions and a prolonged reaction
time.

With the appropriate reaction conditions for the preparation
of
acid derivatives 14 and 15 in hand, the
next focus was on the screening of different activating reagents for
their use in the construction of title compounds 9 and 10 via coupling with 3. Two main objectives of
optimization had to be monitored carefully, reaction yield and selectivity.
It was found that compound 9 is prone to regio-isomerization
to 10 under the reaction conditions and/or workup. Because
both compounds have similar physico-chemical properties, they were
difficult to separate completely by column chromatography. Selectivity
of reaction conditions was thus highly important. Therefore, we decided
to test two different approaches to find the optimal selectivity:
a coupling reagent approach and acid activation via an oxalyl chloride
(acid chloride) approach. The most common coupling reagents such as
DCC (N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide),
EDC (1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide), TBTU (2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium tetrafluoroborate),
DPPA (diphenylphosphoryl azide), and CDI (1,1′-carbonyldiimidazole)
were examined in the presence of NMM (N-methylmorpholine)
in this study (Table S2), and the overall
yield and selectivity ratio were determined by HPLC analysis. The
conducted screening of above mentioned coupling methods and coupling
reagents demonstrated that the best results are obtained when 15 was activated with oxalyl chloride in CH2Cl2 in the presence of a catalytic amount of DMF at 0 °C
for 1.5 h followed by the addition of 3 × HCl and
NMM in MeCN at 0 °C and stirring for 1 h. This procedure afforded
an 88% overall yield of 9 + 10 with a 9/10 ratio of 7.8 (Table S2, entry 19). Among all coupling reagents, the best performance
in terms of selectivity was noted for EDC, which afforded a 61% overall
yield of 9 + 10 with a 9/10 ratio of 16 (Table S2, entry
5).

Our next goal was to select the most appropriate solvent
for coupling
reaction between 15 and 3 using EDC as a
coupling reagent in the presence of NMM. Our previous experiments
demonstrated that the longer reaction time did not improve the overall
yield of product 9; therefore, only two different reaction
times were examined (1 h at 0 °C or the first hour at 0 °C
and the second hour at room temperature, see Table S3). When coupling reactions of 15 and 3 with EDC were conducted, DMF was selected as the most optimal solvent
with a 77% yield and selectivity ratio of 30.4 (Table S3, entry 10). In the case of the acid activation approach,
THF was the most optimal solvent leading to promising an 84% yield
and 30.8 selectivity ratio (Table S3, entry
13).

The most important part of the optimization process was
the selection
of the appropriate base since it could lead to the regio-isomerization
of 9 to 10. In fact, NMR study in deuterated
DMF (Figure S15) and THF (Figure S16) revealed that compound 9 undergoes
regio-isomerization to 10 when treated with an organic
base, such as NMM or Et3N. The regio-isomerization was
observed at 0 °C as well as at room temperature where the equilibrium
ratio of 9/10 is 1:4 or 1:6.14 after 24
h in deuterated DMF or THF, respectively (Figures S15 and S16). Our further NMR study by 2D NMR techniques (see
the Supporting Information, Figures S4 and S11) in CDCl3 showed that the identification of 9 versus 10 or vice versa can be proved by heteronuclear
multiple bond correlation (HMBC).

The addition of a base was
necessary to form the free base of 3 that would be capable
of coupling reactions with 14 and 15. In
addition, the HCl salt of 3 was not soluble in most organic
solvents. Different bases such as
NMM, Et3N, pyridine, and DMAP were screened, which resulted
in large differences in terms of yields and selectivities in both
reactions, with EDC and oxalyl chloride (Table 2). Et3N (Table 2, entries 3 and 4) was slightly less appropriate
compared to NMM (Table 2, entries 1 and 2) when EDC was used, whereas pyridine and DMAP (Table 2, entries 5 and 6)
led to lower yields and worse selectivities. The combinations of bases
NMM and DMAP (Table 2, entries 7–10) improved the yield and retained good selectivity
only when a 9:1 mixture was used (Table 2, entry 7). On the other hand, NMM and Py
combination gave less optimal outcomes (Table 2, entries 11 and 12). According to this study,
it could be seen that the selection of a base is the most critical
step for the selective preparation of amide 9. The use
of NMM with 10% of DMAP as a base and also a catalyst improved the
yield to 85%, preserving the good selectivity ratio about 20:1. In
the case of activation of carboxylic acid with oxalyl chloride (Table 2, entries 13–15),
Et3N was selected as the most optimal base giving a 91%
yield and 23.6 selectivity ratio (Table 2, entry 14).

b Determined
by HPLC.

Our study indicated
that the addition of a base favors regio-isomerization
of the allylbenzene derivative leading to the more stable isomerized
alkene derivative, such as compound 13, 14, or 10. Therefore, the reaction of isomerized acid 14 to alkene impurity 10 is much less problematic
in terms of selectivity. Moreover, the addition of a base will favor
the formation of isomerized alkene impurity 10. With
the appropriate reaction conditions for amidation of 15 to alkene impurity I (9) in hand, we decided to use
the optimized oxalyl chloride/Et3N procedure for conversion
of 14 to alkene impurity II (10), which
was then isolated in a high 76% yield. Furthermore, we also decided
to examine the amidation of 14 using EDC as a coupling
reagent. Since EDC/HOBt combination gave a higher yield and favorized
the formation of 10 over 9 compared to EDC
(Table S2, entries 4–9), we used
the EDC/HOBt/NMM procedure for the final step of the synthesis of 10, which was obtained in a satisfactory 68% yield. Thus,
we proved that the acid chloride method is more suitable for the last
step of the syntheses of both alkene impurities 9 and 10 (Scheme 2).

Alkene Impurities I (9) and II (10) from
Readily Available 1-Bromo-2,4,5-trifluorobenzene (11)
Conclusions
In this study, we established
two new straightforward and efficient
synthetic approaches to two important USP impurities of sitagliptin:
3-desamino-2,3-dehydrositagliptin 9 and 3-desamino-3,4-dehydrositagliptin 10. These impurities can be generated during the manufacturing
process of sitagliptin or the shelf-life of sitagliptin-based drug
products. Even though the syntheses of impurities 9 and 10 were already described in the literature and patents4,9−15 prior our work, our novel synthetic approach starts from the commercially
available and most importantly cheap starting material 1-bromo-2,4,5-trifluorobenzene
(11), which is converted to 9 or 10 in only three steps with satisfactory overall yields ranging from
57 to 64% and purity above 95%. The key reaction was the amide bond
formation where the challenging regio-isomerization as a side reaction
occurred. Our study indicated that the selection of a base has a high
impact on the levels of formation of a side product 10, thus presenting the most critical feature for selective synthesis
of compound 9. The highest yield (71%) with a satisfactory
selectivity ratio of isolated product 9 was obtained
using 15, oxalyl chloride, and Et3N as a base
at 0 °C. On the other hand, the reaction of regio-isomerized
acid 14 to alkene impurity 10 is less problematic
in terms of selectivity, resulting in a 68 or 76% yield for the EDC/HOBt
or acid chloride method, respectively.

To sum up, our work provides
facile and reliable access to two
key USP impurities that could be used as analytical standards and
thereby enables reliable quality control of important antidiabetic
drug sitagliptin. Finally, we believe that our work clearly demonstrates
the importance of proper selection of solvent, base, and coupling/activating
reagents to minimize the carbon–carbon double bond regio-isomerization
when Michael acceptor-type allylbenzene derivatives are subjected
to amide bond formation.

Experimental Section
General Information
All reagents and solvents purchased
commercially (from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros Organics, Apollo Scientific,
TCI, ABCR GmbH & Co) were used without further purification unless
noted otherwise. Tetrahydrofuran was distilled over sodium and dichloromethane
was distilled over calcium hydride. Other anhydrous solvents (acetonitrile,
DMF) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without further purification.
The reactions with anhydrous solvents were performed in oven-dried
glasswares under an argon atmosphere. Melting points were determined
on a Reichert micro-hot-stage apparatus and are uncorrected. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) analysis was performed on silica-gel plates (Merck
DC Silica plates 60 GF254). Visualization of compounds was done by
illumination with a UV lamp (254 nm). Flash column chromatography
was performed on Merck silica gel 60 (mesh size, 70–230), using
the indicated solvents. 1H and 13C spectra were
recorded with a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz NMR (400 and 100 MHz) instrument
at 295 K. Proton spectra were referenced to the signal of CDCl3 (7.26 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (2.50 ppm).
Carbon chemical shifts were determined relative to the 13C signal of CDCl3 (77.16 ppm) or DMSO-d6 (39.52 ppm). Assignments of some proton and carbon resonances
were performed by 2D NMR techniques (1H–1H gs-COSY, 1H–13C gs-HSQC, and 1H–13C gs-HMBC). Coupling constants (J) are given
in hertz (Hz). Multiplicities are indicated as follows: s, singlet;
d, doublet; dd, double doublet; td, triple doublet; t, triplet; dt,
double triplet; ddd, double of doublet of doublet; m, multiplet; and
br, broadened. HPLC chromatograms of pure compounds 9 and 10 were recorded on a Thermo Scientific Dionex
UltiMate 3000 with a UV detector (254 nm) equipped with an Agilent
Extend C18 column (3.5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm), a flow rate of
1.5 mL/min, an inj. volume of 20 μL, at 25 °C, and an eluent
system of H2O (A) and CH3CN (B). The following
gradient was applied: 0–20 min, 10 → 100% B. Isocratic
mixture of CH3CN 35% and H2O 65% was used for
the analyses of the reaction mixtures via HPLC, with a flow rate of
1 mL/min, and a column temperature of 25 °C. Peak areas of liquid
chromatogram were monitored and determined at 254 nm. The reaction
yield was calculated in the reference to the known concentration of
acetanilide as a standard. Sample preparation: 50 μL of reaction
mixture was diluted with 950 μL of acetanilide solution in acetonitrile.
The sample was further diluted (1/10) with acetonitrile and filtered
to obtain the final sample for HPLC analysis.

Optimized Synthetic Procedures
for Alkene Impurities 9 and 10
Synthesis of methyl (E)-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)but-2-enoate
(12): a dry
and nitrogen-flushed flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer and a
rubber septum was charged with anhydrous THF (36 mL) and cooled to
−20 °C. 1-Bromo-2,4,5-trifluorobenzene (11) (25.0 g, 118.5 mmol; 13.9 mL) was introduced through a septum,
followed by the dropwise addition (addition rate: 0.666 mL/min) of i-PrMgCl (118.5 mmol, 59.25 mL; 2.0 M solution in THF).
The reaction mixture was stirred at −20 °C for an additional
1 h. The solution of (2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)magnesium chloride obtained
was immediately used further.

A flame-dried and nitrogen-flushed
flask equipped with a stirring bar and a rubber septum was charged
with CoBr2 (anhydrous, beads, 1.0 g, 4.57 mmol), sarcosine
(dried 16 h under vacuum at 50 °C, 8.46 mmol, 0.754 g) and dissolved
in anhydrous THF (564 mL) under an argon atmosphere. After 1 h, the
reaction mixture was cooled to −20 °C, and methyl 4-bromocrotonate
(15.15 g, 84.63 mmol, 10.0 mL) was added. After 15 min, the prepared
solution of (2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)magnesium chloride (118.5 mmol,
109 mL) was added dropwise (addition rate: 1.387 mL/min), and the
solution obtained was stirred for 1.5 h at −20 °C and
an additional 0.5 h at 0 °C. Afterward, the saturated ammonium
chloride solution (300 mL) was added to the reaction mixture, which
was further washed with ethyl acetate (2 × 500 mL). The combined
organic phases were washed with brine (250 mL), dried with anhydrous
Na2SO4, filtered, and evaporated. The oil residue
