Natural fibrils derived from biomass
were used as a template to
synthesize uniformly decorated nanoparticles (10–12 nm) of
molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) supported on carbon. The nanoparticles have been synthesized
through the carburization and nitridation of molybdenum on cotton
fibrils, using a high-temperature solid-state reaction. The catalyst
exhibits an onset potential of 110 mV and an overpotential of 167
mV to derive a cathodic current density of 10 mA cm–2. The electrocatalyst also demonstrates excellent long-term durability
of more than 2500 cycles in acidic media with a Tafel slope value
of 62 mV dec–1.

1 Introduction
The
environmental concern regarding carbon-dioxide emission, global
warming, and increasing trend of energy requirements has augmented
the urge to invent and use greener and renewable energy sources.1 In this context, hydrogen could be one of the
most feasible and promising energy carriers for future energy needs.2 High energy density and sustainability of hydrogen
as compared to other energy sources might provide carbon-neutral and
clean energy for future needs.3 The hydrogen
production through electrochemical water splitting could be one of
the most effective, economically sustainable, and environment-friendly
processes. In practice, Pt is still considered as one of the most
effective, sustainable, and universally accepted electrocatalysts
for hydrogen generation.4 However, the
expense and availability of Pt make it limited for extensive use.
Non-noble electrocatalysts having similar or better catalytic activity
with respect to Pt can be one of the best alternatives for electrochemical
hydrogen generation.5,6 At present, the primary emphasis
is being given in developing stable, low-cost, and efficient electrocatalysts.
Transition metals with well-known accessibility and remarkable tendency
toward electrochemical water splitting make it suitable for hydrogen
generation.7,8 Metal carbides have been used as a supporting
material to reduce the platinum loading and the overall cost of the
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalyst. However, Vrubel and Hu9 have reported HER-active molybdenum carbide for
the first time in 2012. During 2012–2014, a transition took
place in HER research, when people have started working on non-noble
metal-based molybdenum catalysts. Later on, many reports were published
on the Mo-catalyst, showing remarkably good activity toward HER.9−12 Recently, binary phases of molybdenum-based nanostructured materials
have drawn remarkable attention because of high charge-/mass-transfer
ability on the electrode–electrolyte interface and to minimize
interface resistance and enhance the catalytic performance of the
electrocatalyst.13−15 A report by Chen et al.16 shows that a composite of molybdenum carbide and molybdenum nitride
provides excellent synergic effects and improves the catalytic activity.
A supporting template like holey carbon provides easy pathways to
the charge transfer in the heterojunction Mo2C/Mo2N/HGr nanostructure with outstanding catalytic activity and stability.17 The d-band structure of the specific transition
metals on heteroatom doping gets modified, which brings these composite
into the category of near-noble metals by improving the charge-transfer
process at the interface.11,18−21 Besides this, a morphological variation using templates also plays
a vital role in determining the catalytic activity.22 Herein, we report an inexpensive synthesis of a nanostructured
electrocatalyst supported on carbon derived from cotton fibrils as
templates (Scheme 1). The use of templates not only provides carbon support for the
nanocatalyst formed in the solid-state reaction but also enhances
the charge transfer through the catalyst interface during the reaction.23,24 The reaction condition was improvised in such a way that both Mo2C and Mo2N nanoparticles were formed uniformly
and simultaneously on the carbon support, which shows an overpotential
of 167 mV in acidic media. This study will provide an exciting insight
toward a biphasic molybdenum derivative catalyst grown on the natural
biomass template and also introduce a new system for the fundamental
study of nanohybrids with vast possibilities on the application on
a realistic energy conversion system.

Scheme 1 Illustrating the
Synthesis of the Carbon-Supported Mo2C/Mo2N
Nanohybrid Electrocatalyst from the Biomass Template
and Its Application in Hydrogen Evolution Reaction
2 Results and Discussion
The MoCot catalyst
consisting of uniformly decorated molybdenum
carbide/nitride nanostructures on the biomass template has shown good
catalytic activity. Broadly, the reaction for the formation of Mo2C/Mo2N nanoparticles requires carbon, nitrogen,
and a metal source at a moderately high temperature. It was observed
that Mo2C was formed at a temperature as high as 750 °C,
whereas Mo2N can be synthesized at a relatively low temperature
of 650 °C. Continuing the reaction at 650 °C would lead
to the formation of only nitride and the same reaction at 750 °C
would lead to the formation of the only carbide. The stoichiometry
of the initial precursor mixture is also very crucial as it determines
the final composition of the catalyst. The reaction condition is maneuvered
in such a way that both the nanoparticles can be formed at different
steps of the same reaction. The critical parameters are temperature,
hold-time, and gases, which are purged at an appropriate time. For
example, ammonia was purged only during the formation temperature
(650 °C) of Mo2N. The hexamethylenetetramine (HMT)
acts both as a reducing agent and a carbon/nitrogen source during
the annealing process.25 Initially, Mo
oxyanions decompose into MoO3, and then in the presence
of the carbon/nitrogen source, it reacts and forms Mo2C
and Mo2N nanoparticles onto the fibril substrate at high
temperatures. One exciting aspect of this reaction is that the fibril
structure of the natural cotton remains intact, and only the growth
of the nanoparticles was observed to form onto the surface of the
fiber. Detailed reaction conditions are mentioned in the Supporting Information S1 section. The objective
toward the formation of both the nanomaterials on the same carbon
support lies in the fact that it would result in a synergistic effect
between the Mo2C and Mo2N nanoparticles and
thereby increase the overall catalytic activity.15 Series of reactions were performed to produce several compositions
of Mo2C and Mo2N, out of which MoCot shows the
best catalytic activity.

Structural information of the catalyst
was obtained from powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) measurements as provided in Figure 1a. The PXRD pattern of the
catalyst after annealing exhibit a series of characteristic peaks
located at approximately 34.3°, 37.9°, 39.4°, 52.1°,
61.5°, 69.5°, 72.4, 74.5°, and 75.4° which attributes
to the diffractions of (100), (002), (101), (102), (110), (103), (200),
(112), and (201) planes (PDF 35-0787) of Mo2C hexagonal
system, respectively. The peaks at 37.3°, 43.4°, 63.1°
and 75.7° are characteristics of γ-Mo2N (PDF
25-1366) and correspond to (111), (200), (220) and (311) planes, respectively.
The XRD measurement confirmed that the Mo2C–Mo2N hybrid material (denoted as MoCot) was composed of hexagonal
β-Mo2C and cubic γ-Mo2N. Broad hump
in the PXRD pattern at around 25°–30° value can be
related to the mixed amorphous carbon phase which appears only in
a slow scan. No other impurities or characteristic peaks of oxides
and so forth are observed. The XRD diffraction pattern indicates the
co-existence of Mo2C and Mo2N in all the catalysts
with variation in the composition of both. The catalyst was found
to have 59.12% of Mo2C and 40.88% Mo2N nanoparticles,
respectively, as calculated from Rietveld refinement (Figure 1b). Several other compositions
were prepared, out of which two compositions (MoCot 1 & MoCot
2, Supporting Information S2, Figures S1
and S2) are mentioned in the Supporting Information, which has a closer
overpotential with respect to MoCot.

Figure 1 Structural characterization (a) PXRD typically
shows formation
of both Mo2C–Mo2N phases and (b) compositional
measurements: Rietveld analysis of the catalyst shows a composition
59.12 and 40.88% of Mo2C and Mo2N, respectively.

A close look toward scanning electron micrograph
(Figure 2) along with
elemental mapping
gives detailed morphological information about the nanostructures
and confirms the existence of two different phases. The image clearly
shows that the catalyst having well-decorated Mo2C and
Mo2N nanoparticles developed on the fibril microstructure
template, having different lengths. The carbon support inhibits the
agglomeration of the metal carbide/nitride nanoparticles and thereby
enhances the catalytic activity.

the as-obtained MoCot catalyst and corresponding elemental mapping

nitrogen elements that illustrate the uniform distribution of these
on the fibril template. (e) SEM image shows the collective distribution
of different elements (Mo, C, and N) on the fibril structure.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images (Figure 3a–c) clearly
show the
nanoparticles of the order of 10–12 nm, at two different scales.
The high-resolution (HR) TEM image (Figure 3c inset) shows the two adjoining phases of
nanoparticles with an interface. The visible crystal fringe width
of 0.26 nm corresponds to the (100) plane and 0.24 nm to (111) planes
of Mo2C and Mo2N, respectively.19,26

high magnification: showing the fringe width 0.26 and 0.24 nm consistent
with the (100) and (111) planes of Mo2C and Mo2N nanocrystals.

The surface area, pore
size and distribution, and porosity of the
nanohybrid material were investigated by N2 adsorption/desorption
measurements (Figure S3). The figure typically
demonstrates the type-IV curve shape of the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) isotherm. As evident from the BET measurements, the nanohybrid
material is having a surface area of 63 m2 g–1, in which mesopores are predominantly distributed over a range of
30 nm (Figure S3, inset). This distribution
indicates the material to be mesoporous in nature, which favors mass
transport and adsorption. Formation of uniform nanostructures is essentially
acquired from the inherent morphology of the biomass templates. Hence,
the template used in the reaction is of extreme importance.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further affirmed the chemical
state of the catalyst. The wide range energy survey scan (Figure 4a) indicates the
presence of C, Mo, and N elements in the hybrid structure. The survey
XPS spectrum shows five characteristic signals which are located at
233.6, 285.8, 398.1, 416.5, and 532.2 eV, consistent with Mo 3d, C
1s, N 1s (Mo 3p3/2), Mo 3p1/2, and O 1s, respectively.
The HR spectrum of Mo 3d (Figure 4b) shows splitting in the core level because of spin–orbit
coupling into 3d5/2 and 3d3/2 peaks. These peaks
with binding energy values at 228.4 and 231.5 eV are described as
Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2 of Mo2+ spectral
lines, respectively, and they confirm the presence of Mo2C.27,28 Other peaks at 235.1 and 235.9 eV are indicating
the presence of Mo4O11 and MoO329−31 while 232.4 and 229.2 eV may be assigned to MoO2.32 Surface oxidation of Mo2C (during
the XPS measurements) is the reason for the indication of the presence
of high concentration of molybdenum oxides. The Mo 3d5/2 peak of Mo2N appears at around 228.7 eV which is overshadowed
because of the adjacent peak.33 In C 1s,
energy spectra (Figure 4c) were deconvoluted into two peaks centered at 283.8 and 284.7 eV,
which shows the binding energy of Mo–C and C=C species,
respectively.27,34 Deconvolution of the N 1s and
Mo 3p3/2 peaks depict two different Mo 3p3/2 peaks having binding energies 398.8 and 395.3 eV, respectively (Figure 4d). The binding energy
of 395.3 eV may be attributed to Mo 3p3/2 of Mo2N35 and the binding energy of 398.8 eV
is due to Mo 3p3/2 of MoO3. The overlap of N
1s peaks of Mo2N and pyridinic-N with Mo 3p peaks might
significantly enhance the electrochemical activation of graphitic
carbon.35 Because of the use of extrinsic
nitrogen during the pyrolysis of biomass or performing the reaction
under nitrogen-rich conditions, species may be generated with an abundance
of pyridinic-N, pyrrolic-N, quaternary-N, and pyridone-N oxides.36,37 Among the nitrogen species, the formation of pyridinic N dominates
the formation of other species which is favorable to HER performance.

the MoCot catalyst: wide-scan survey spectra (a) and HR
spectra of Mo 3d (b), C 1s (c), and N 1s (d) electron: experimental
data (dotted curve) and fitting results (solid curve). The peaks are
assigned by oxidation states of different elements with their corresponding
binding energy.

The HER activity of all the catalysts
was primarily measured by
linear sweep voltammetry in 0.5 M H2SO4 saturated
with argon at 25° centigrade using three-electrode cells. In
order to perform a systematic study, Mo2C and Mo2N have also been synthesized with the same method as was used for
MoCot, but varying the parameters and gases used in the reaction.
The commercially available Pt/C (20 wt %) catalysts were also tested
under similar conditions. As depicted in Figure 5, MoCot has an onset potential nearly 110
mV. The polarization curves at rate 5 mV/s were calculated considering
the iR-compensation. From the polarization curve
(Figure 5a), it can
be concluded that MoCot is HER-active and has an overpotential of
167 mV to derive the current density of 10 mA/cm2. The
comparison of the MoCot catalyst with that of Mo2C (218
mV) and Mo2N (465 mV) catalysts undoubtedly confirms that
the catalytic activity MoCot is way too better than the other two.
The Tafel slope value has a high significance not only in determining
the possible reaction pathway but also in predicting the adsorption
behavior of the catalyst for a quantitative determination of HER kinetics.38 A description of the procedure for electrode
fabrication is described in the Supporting Information S4.1. The LSV plot of the MoCot 1 & MoCot 2 composites is shown
in Supporting Information S4.2 (Figure
S5).

LSV stability curve at 1st, 2500th, and 3000th cycle (inset shows
the potential testing at constant current density 10, 20, and 30 mA
cm–2).

Theoretically, for the
Tafel slope, the linear portions must fit
with equation η = b log(j)
+ a, where a is the Tafel constant, b is the Tafel slope, j is the current
density, and η is the overpotential.39 Here, we have calculated Tafel plots for MoCot and of pure Mo2C, Mo2N, and PtC (20%) as shown in Figure 5b. The Tafel slope values of
62, 85, 196 mV/dec were measured for MoCot, Mo2C, and Mo2N, respectively. The same for commercially available Pt/C
catalyst was found to be ∼35 mV/dec. However, with respect
to Mo2C and Mo2N, MoCot have a lower value suggesting
that the reaction proceeds through a mixed Volmer–Heyrovsky
process and thus the recombination step is the rate-determining step.

Transport properties and interfacial interactions of the concerned
catalyst were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) with an overpotential of 50, 150, and 250 mV in 0.5 M H2SO4 aqueous solution (Figure 5c). The Nyquist plot reveals the effective
resistance shown by the electrocatalyst resulting from the combined
effects of Ohmic resistance and reactance. Simulating and simultaneous
fitting of the experimental curve with the equivalent circuit provides
information regarding the contribution of each component. Here, the
fitting of the plot with the equivalent circuit shows two time-constant
components Rct-CPEdL and Rp-CPEL along with an uncompensated
solution resistance Rs (in series) describing
the response of HER on the catalyst-modified electrode. CPE is the
constant phase angle element, which represents the double-layer capacitance
of the solid electrode. Rct-CPEdL is related to the charge-transfer process, and Rp-CPEL can be correlated with surface porosity.26,40 The charge transfer resistance varies inversely with respect to
the potential applied. A charge transfer resistance (Rct) of 20 Ω is obtained in the low-frequency region
when a potential of 50 mV is applied. The smaller value of Rct implies a larger number of active sites present
in the catalyst, and hence, the charge transfer between the electrode
and electrolyte would be high, which favors the HER process. The durability
measurement (Figure 5d) indicates a high stability performance of the catalyst and shows
no significant change in the overpotential of the catalyst even after
2500 LSV cycles. The stability trend (inset Figure 5d) measured at higher current densities,
that is, 20 and 30 mA/cm2, are similar to that of 10 mA/cm2, suggesting that the electrocatalytic activity profile does
not change at high current density. The stability of the MoCot composite
was further verified by X-ray analysis of the catalyst after 2500
cycles (Supporting Information S5, Figure
S8). The composition was found to be consistent with the one recorded
before the reaction. Thus, the catalyst demonstrates good stability
toward the HER process.

3 Conclusions
In this
work, nanoparticles of molybdenum carbide (Mo2C) and molybdenum
nitride (Mo2N) with size 10–12
nm were grown uniformly on biomass (used as a template obtained from
cotton) by manipulating the reaction conditions. Formation of uniform
nanostructures was acquired from the inherent structure of the biomass
templates. Hence, the nature of the template used in the reaction
is of tremendous importance. The catalytic activity increased abruptly
when both the nanoparticles were grown on the same carbon platform
through the carburization and nitridation of the molybdenum precursor
by annealing at an appropriate temperature. The activation caused
possibly due to the synergistic effect of C–N present in the
metal carbide/nitride nanoparticles through the carbon layers along
the surface. The catalyst demonstrates long-term stability and high
conductivity in acidic media and exhibits an onset potential of 110
mV and an overpotential of 167 mV to derive a cathodic current density
10 mA cm–2. The electrocatalyst also exhibits high
stability of withstanding more than 2500 cycles in acidic media with
a Tafel slope value of 62 mV dec–1. This study will
open up an area of exploration for developing nanostructured binary
composites on biomass as templates for the HER application. The process
is inexpensive and produces highly stable electrocatalysts. The methodology
can be applied to numerous kinds of biomass having different morphologies
as the later plays a crucial role in catalytic activity.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Synthesis of the Catalyst
Chemicals
used in the following reactions were purchased and used without further
purification. Ammonium molybdate tetrahydrate ((NH4)6·Mo7O24·4H2O),
Sigma-Aldrich 99.0%; N,N-dimethylformamide
anhydrous, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich; Nafion perfluorinated resin solution,
5 wt % in lower aliphatic alcohols; HMT (C6H12N4) 95%, TCI; ammonium hydroxide NH3·H2O (25%); sterilized cotton; deionized water was used in all
preparations.

The synthesis of the MoCot catalyst was carried
out in two steps. First, the preparation of the precursor and second,
the calcination of the cotton-soaked metal precursor by temperatures
controlled annealing in the ammonia and argon atmosphere at different
time periods.

4.1.1 Synthesis of the Catalyst Precursor
For the precursor, 0.01 mol of HMT and 0.001 mol of ammonium molybdate
tetrahydrate [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O] were mixed into a solution of 2.5 mL of ammonia
water (25%). The mixture was stirred until it became transparent.
Then, 1 g of finely chopped cotton was dipped and soaked into the
solution mentioned above. The soaked cotton, along with the remaining
solution, was transferred into a hydrothermal bomb and heated to 100
°C into an oven for 12 h. The product obtained was then dried
in a vacuum oven at 100 °C for 6 h to yield a greenish-white
mass.

4.1.2 Temperature-Programmed Calcination of the
Precursor (Second Step)
This process is specifically designed
for the synthesis of MoCot. The furnace was purged with argon initially
for 20 min to make an inert environment for the sample before the
reaction. The cotton-soaked catalyst precursor (greenish-white mass)
was heated to 650 °C with a ramp rate of 7°/min in the tube
furnace under argon with a flow of 30 mL/min. The reaction was held
for 1 h under ammonia at a flow rate of 20 mL/min, and after that,
the gas was switched to argon and the temperature increased to 750 °C
and held for another 2.5 h. The MoCot catalyst was obtained by gradually
cooling the product under argon. The simultaneous formation of the
Mo2C and Mo2N nanoparticles is highly sensitive
not only toward the initial stoichiometry of the catalyst precursor
but also toward the temperature manipulation with respect to the time
and nature of the gases used.

All these parameters were judiciously
optimized to obtain various compositions of Mo2C and Mo2N on the carbon template (Mo2C, Mo2N,
MoCot 1, and MoCot 2, discussed in Supporting Information S1).

4.2 Physical
Characterization
XRD of
the solid was done using a Bruker Eco D8 ADVANCE X Powder X-ray diffractometer
using the Ni filter employing Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.54056
Å, 40 kV and 25 mA) in the 2θ range of 5°–80°
with an increment of 0.00190/step. The surface area and pore size
analysis of the samples were examined by nitrogen physisorption at
77 K in Autosorb IQ Quantachrome instrument using the BET and the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda equation. Surface morphology
was studied using a scanning electron microscope from JEOL (JSM IT-300)
equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray diffractometer (Bruker), and
TEM images were acquired using a JEOL-2100 operated at 200 kV. XPS
was performed on ESCALab: 220-IXL with Mg Kα nonmonochromated
X-ray beam having photon energy 1253.6 eV.

4.3 Electrochemical
Measurements
CHI
760E electrochemical workstation setup was used at room temperature
for all the electrochemical measurements. Herein, we have used a conventional
three-electrode cell system containing a carbon-based electrode, Ag/AgCl
electrode, and glassy carbon electrode as a counter, reference, and
working electrode, respectively. The catalyst ink was prepared by
dispersing 5 mg of electrocatalyst powder into 500 μL of dimethylformamide
containing 5 μL of 5 wt % Nafion and keeping it for 120 min
under ultrasonication to form a homogeneous suspension. A dispersed
ink of 5 μL was coated on to the surface of the working electrode
employing drop-casting and dried under vacuum. The overpotential and
other electrochemical measurements were calculated with respect to
the Ag/AgCl electrode and further referenced with the reversible hydrogen
electrode (RHE), according to the equation E (RHE)
= E (Ag/AgCl) + 0.059 pH + 0.197 V. For all the measurements,
polarization curves were collected under an argon atmosphere at a
scan rate of 5 mV s–1 containing 0.5 M H2SO4 solution unless otherwise mentioned. The overpotential
was further corrected to eliminate the Ohmic drop according to the
equation η corrected = η – iRs whereas Rs is solution resistance.
EIS measurements were performed at particular values of the overpotential,
that is, η = 50, 150, and 250 mV under a frequency range of
100 000–1 Hz.
