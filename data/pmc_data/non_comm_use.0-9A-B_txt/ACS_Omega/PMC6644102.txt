A novel luminescent azo-linked polymer
(ALP) has been constructed
from 1,3,6,8-tetra(4-aminophenyl)pyrene using a copper(I)-catalyzed
oxidative homocoupling reaction. The polymer displays high porosity
with a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller surface area of 1259 m2 g–1 and narrow pore size distribution (1.06
nm) and is able to take up a significant amount of CO2 (2.89
mmol g–1) at 298 K and 1.00 bar with a high isosteric
heat of adsorption of 27.5 kJ mol–1. Selectivity
studies applying the ideal adsorbed solution theory revealed that
the novel polymer has moderately good selectivities for CO2/N2 (55.1) and CO2/CH4 (10.9). Furthermore,
the ALP shows fluorescence quenching in the presence of Hg2+, Pb2+, Tl+, and Al3+ ions. Compared
with these ions, the ALP showed no sensitivity to light metal ions
such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+ in ethanol–water
solution, clearly indicating the high selectivity of the ALP toward
heavy metal ions. The exceptional physiochemical stability, high porosity,
and strong luminescence make this polymer an excellent candidate as
a fluorescent chemical sensor for the detection of heavy metal ions.

1 Introduction
Porous
organic polymers (POPs) are an emerging class of materials
that have witnessed increasing interest because of their applications
in gas storage and separation,1−4 catalysis,5−10 sensing,11−15 and optoelectronics.16,17 Such diverse applications stem
from the numerous available building blocks and various synthetic
routes that allow the design and construction of different POPs tailored
for specific applications. Because of their exceptional physiochemical
stability, high surface area, and structure/function tunability, POPs
have been widely explored for the capture and separation of carbon
dioxide (CO2), a gas that is linked directly to climate
change and global warming.1−4,18,19 It is well documented that POPs containing polar chemical functionalities
and Lewis basic sites show enhanced CO2 binding energy,
presumably via hydrogen bonding, dipole–quadrupole interactions,
and Lewis acid–base interactions, thus leading to an improvement
in CO2 uptake and selectivity over gases such as nitrogen
and methane.20−22 Introduction of polar functional groups such as amines
into the POP frameworks such as amine, which provide CO2-philic sites, has been explored using both post- and presynthetic
modification of sorbents.23−27 However, such synthetic routes, in general, suffer from the use
of expensive transition metal-based catalysts, multistep reactions,
and extensive purification steps and hence are not practical for large-scale
preparation. In addition, amine-decorated POPs show limited chemical
stability because of their proneness to oxidative degradation in air,
whereas imine-linked POPs suffer from poor CO2/N2 selectivity, especially at elevated temperatures.27 To avoid such drawbacks, others and we have recently reported
a low-cost and efficient synthetic route for the preparation of a
series of azo-linked polymers (ALPs).2,28−30 The nitrogen–nitrogen double bonds (azo-bonds) in such porous
materials provide the Lewis basic sites that are needed for the CO2 molecules to interact with the framework without compromising
the chemical stability as the case in amine-based POPs. Not surprisingly,
these ALPs showed remarkable physiochemical stability, high CO2 uptake capacities, and good CO2/N2 selectivity
at ambient conditions.2,29

Besides CO2 capture,
the detection of heavy metal ions
also poses another environmental and health challenge addressed in
this work. Natural resource pollution is a huge problem especially
water contaminated with heavy metals such as mercury, lead, and thallium,
which are extremely toxic to the environment as well for human consumption.31 A recent example of such contamination of drinking
water by the lead metal from industrial sources was reported in Flint,
Michigan in 2015.32 The incident had a
devastating effect on public health, where many people have reported
lead-poisoning symptoms and a huge economic cost. Such incidents impose
a challenging problem to the scientific community to develop fast-response
sensor systems for continuous monitoring of drinking water sources
and for remediation of contaminations. Luminescent sensors represent
potential solutions for sensitive and selective detection of heavy
metal contaminants of drinking water; a recent example has shown detection
limits as low as parts per billion levels for Ag+ ions
and parts per million levels for lead and thallium by a phosphorescent
molecular/polymeric composite chemosensor.33

The synergistic functionalities and properties of POPs containing
rich π-conjugated building blocks decorated with heteroatoms,
and high surface areas provide docking sites and broad interface for
metals’ interaction, which allow enhancement in the signaling
sensitivity.13,15,34,35 In addition, the recyclability of POP sensors
can be easily achieved because of the weak interaction (physisorption)
of the analytes and the frameworks of POPs. Another added advantage
of POPs as sensors is the plentiful apertures’ availability,
leading to increase in the diffusion rates and thereby faster response
times. Despite such attractive properties that POPs offer, their use
as chemical sensors is not well-developed and mostly limited to the
detection of nitroaromatic compounds.36−38

With the above
considerations and challenges in mind, herein, we
report on the synthesis and characterization of a new azo-bond-functionalized
polymer bearing a pyrene moiety, Azo-Py. The novel azo-linked porous
polymer was synthesized using a 1,3,6,8-tetra(4-aminophenyl)pyrene
monomer and a CuBr-catalyzed oxidative homocoupling reaction.39 We have shown that the electron-rich and rigid
pyrene core of 1,3,6,8-tetra(4-aminophenyl)pyrene leads to a highly
porous polymer and exhibits a solid-state packing behavior, resulting
in a nanofiber morphology.21 This was facilitated
by π–π stacking of the highly conjugated pyrene
group. The CO2 uptake and selectivity of Azo-Py were studied
for flue gas and landfill gas mixtures. Furthermore, because of its
excellent fluorescence properties, the potential utility of Azo-Py
as a selective chemosensor for the detection of heavy metal ions (such
as mercury, lead, and thallium, among others) was also investigated.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 General Techniques and
Materials
All solvents, starting materials, and reagents
were purchased from
Acros Organics and used without any further purification unless otherwise
noted. 4-Aminophenylboronic acid pinacol ester and tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)
were purchased from Aldrich. Air-sensitive materials and reactions
were handled or carried out in an inert atmosphere (nitrogen gas)
using a glovebox or Schlenk line techniques. 1,3,6,8-Tetra(4-aminophenyl)pyrene
was prepared according to literature procedures.40 Elemental analysis was performed for carbon, nitrogen,
and hydrogen on an Euro EA3000 Series CHN elemental analyzer (EuroVector
Instruments). 1H NMR was conducted using a Varian Mercury-400
MHz NMR spectrometer. Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were
obtained using a Nicolet Nexus 670 spectrometer equipped with an attenuated
total reflectance accessory. The thermal stability of the synthesized
polymers was assessed using a Perkin thermo-gravimetric analyzer with
a temperature ramp rate of 5 °C/min under N2 flow.
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were obtained to the morphology
of the polymers using a Hitachi SU-70 FE-SEM. The samples were prepared
by dispersion onto a double-sided carbon tape attached to the sample
holder, followed by a platinum coating for 70 s at 1 × 10–6 bar. Powder X-ray diffraction data were collected
using a PANalytical X’Pert PRO multipurpose diffractometer
by Cu Kα radiation with a 2θ range of 2–30.

2.2 Gas Uptake Studies
Porosity and gas
uptake studies were conducted using a Quantachrome Autosorb iQ volumetric
analyzer using gases of ultrahigh-purity grade. Typically, an Azo-Py
sample (∼40–50 mg) was loaded into a preweighed 9 mm
large bulb Quantachrome cell, which was then hooked up to the degassing
station of the gas analyzer. The sample was then degassed at 120 °C
and 1.0 × 10–5 bar for 12 h. The degassed sample
and cell were refilled with helium, weighed, and hooked up to the
analysis station of the gas analyzer. Adsorption temperatures were
attained using a temperature-controlled water/ethylene glycol mixture
bath for 273 and 298 K and a refrigerated bath of liquid nitrogen
for 77 K.

2.3 Photoluminescence Studies
The photoluminescence
measurements were obtained with a PTI QuantaMaster model QM-4 scanning
spectrofluorometer. The instrument has the capabilities to measure
near-infrared (IR) luminescence with the attached accessory along
with the direct quantum yield using a spherical integration sphere,
which is attached to the sample chamber. A suspension of the polymer
(0.1 mg/1 mL) in the corresponding solvent was sonicated for 15 min
at room temperature and was then placed (3 mL) in a quartz cuvette.
Aliquots of the metal solutions (0.1 M) were added, and the fluorescence
spectrum (λexc = 360 nm) was recorded after every
addition. Mercury salt (HgBr2) was dissolved in acetonitrile,
whereas the metal solution (NaNO3, KNO3, Ca(NO3)2, Pb(NO3)2, TlNO3, and AlCl3) was prepared in methanol/water (2:3) solutions. Caution: Thallium compounds are highly toxic in nature and
extra caution (e.g., wearing triple gloves) is to be taken while handling
them.

2.4 Synthesis of Azo-Py
Azo-Py was synthesized
following a procedure established and further optimized by El-Kaderi
et al.2,30 A solution of CuBr (25 mg, 0.174 mmol) and
pyridine (110 mg, 1.391 mmol) in 11 mL of toluene was stirred at 25
°C for 3 h in a 50 mL round-bottom flask and an open air atmosphere.
To this solution, 1,3,6,8-tetra(4-aminophenyl)pyrene (100 mg, 0.176
mmol) dissolved in 11 mL tetrahydrofuran (THF) was added. The mixture
was stirred in an open air atmosphere at 25 °C for 24 h and refluxed
at 60 °C for 12 h and then at 80 °C for 12 h. A burgundy
colored solid was isolated by filtration and subsequently washed with
THF and water. The obtained powder was stirred in HCl (100 mL, 2 M)
for 12 h, filtered, and then washed with water. The powder was further
treated with NaOH (2 M), water, ethanol, THF, and chloroform. The
final product was dried at 120 °C under vacuum (150 mTorr) to
give Azo-Py as a burgundy colored powder (82 mg, 83%). Anal. Calcd

N, 10.03%. Found: C, 70.76%; H, 4.39%; N 8.23%.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Synthesis and Characterization
of Azo-Py
Azo-Py was prepared via an oxidative homocoupling
of aniline-functionalized
monomer with a pyrene core, yielding robust azo-bonded linkages as
presented in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route for the Preparation of Azo-Py
This polymerization reaction was carried out
following our recent
report, which outlined the optimum molar amount of CuBr, solvent composition,
and temperature ramp profile in order to enhance the porosity of the
resulting polymer.2 Azo-Py is insoluble
in common organic solvents such as water, THF, chloroform, toluene,
and ethanol—depicting its structure as a highly cross-linked
framework. Polymerization of Azo-Py was confirmed using Fourier transform
IR (FTIR) spectroscopy (Figure S1). Vibrational
bands in the region of 1415–1400 cm–1 signify
the presence of azo bonds expected in Azo-Py. Also, the decrease in
intensity of the N–H stretching bands at 3200–3450 cm–1 indicates the consumption of secondary amine groups
of the monomers taking part in the azo-bond formation. It should be
noted that unreacted terminal amines are seen as expected in the FTIR
spectra of Azo-Py. SEM imaging (Figure 1A) shows that Azo-Py formed a nanofibrous morphology
similar to previously reported benzimidazole-linked polymers (BILPs)
bearing a pyrene core.21,41 It is presumed that these nanofibers,
which are about 0.2 μm in thickness and of varying length, result
from π–π stacking interactions induced by the rigid
and highly-conjugated pyrene core. The thermal stability of Azo-Py
was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which showed stability
up to near 500 °C (Figure 1B). Powder X-ray diffraction revealed an amorphous material
as there were no distinct peaks in the spectra (Figure S2).

isotherm at 77 K, and (D) PSD of Azo-Py.

3.2 Porosity and Textural Properties
The porosity and textural properties of Azo-Py were characterized
from its nitrogen isotherm at 77 K (Figure 1C). A steeply-increasing uptake is observed
at lower pressure ranges (P/Po < 0.035), followed by a decline in the slope of uptake
in higher pressure ranges (P/Po ∼ 0.035–0.9). This trend is indicative of a
highly microporous material with a minor mesoporous pore size distribution
(PSD).42,43 The textural properties of Azo-Py are summarized
in Table 1. The 1259
m2 g–1 Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of Azo-Py is higher than previously reported azo-bond-functionalized
POPs including ALPs (412–1235 m2 g–1),2,30 azo-COPs (493–729 m2 g–1),20 and azo-POFs (439–712
m2 g–1).44 Particularly, the surface area is higher than that in some of the
BILPs bearing a pyrene backbone including BILP-10, 11, and 13 (658–787
m2 g–1).21 A direct comparison can be made with BILP-10 (787 m2 g–1) as it is the benzimidazole-linked analogue to Azo-Py.
In this case, the superior surface area of Azo-Py is a testament to
the optimized synthetic route implemented for achieving high porosity
in ALPs that we recently reported.2 However,
BILP-12 displays a higher surface area than Azo-Py because of the
incorporated triptycene building which has an internal molecular free
volume (IMFV).45 A PSD curve was generated
by fitting the adsorption branch of the N2 isotherm at
77 K to quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT) model for
slit and cylindrical pores for carbon (Figure 1D). The curve shows a dominant pore size
centered at 0.64 nm for Azo-Py. The total pore volume of the polymer
was deduced from a single adsorption point, at P/Po = 0.95, and found to be 0.699 cm3 g–1. The micropore volume was also determined
to be 0.377 cm3 g–1 making up 53.9% of
the total pore volume. Additionally, the profile of ultra-micropores
(< 0.7 nm) was elucidated by nonlocalized DFT fitting of the adsorption
branch of the CO2 isotherm at 273 K (Figure S3) with the ultra-micropore volume quantified to be
0.016 cm3 g–1.

3.3 Gas Uptake
and Selectivity Studies
The textural properties discussed
above, including the high surface
area, microporous nature, and narrow pore size have proven to be effective
in enhancing the CO2 uptake in porous frameworks. Additionally,
the incorporation of azo-bonds in porous sorbents has been theoretically
and experimentally validated to enhance CO2 uptake facilitated
via Lewis acid–base interactions between CO2 and
the azo functionalities.22 With that in
consideration, the gas uptake capacity of Azo-Py was investigated
by collecting low-pressure CO2, CH4, and N2 isotherms at 273 and 298 K presented in Figure 2 and summarized in Table 2. The CO2 isotherms display a steep rise in the low-pressure region and no
hysteresis in the adsorption and desorption curves characteristic
of sorbents that can be regenerated at a low energy penalty. At 273
K and 1 bar, Azo-Py has a CO2 uptake of 4.79 mmol g–1, which is higher than BILP-10, -11, and -13 (2.6–4.0
mmol g–1). Consistent with the surface area difference,
Azo-Py had a lower CO2 uptake than BILP-12 (5.1 mmol g–1).41 This is indicative
of the direct correlation between the surface area and CO2 uptake that has been observed in most porous polymers. In relation
to other azo-functionalized polymers, Azo-Py has a higher CO2 uptake at 273 K and 1 bar than all ALPs (2.5–4.7 mmol g–1) except for ALP-1 (5.37 mmol g–1).2,30 While at 298 K and 1 bar, Azo-Py has a CO2 uptake of 2.89 mmol g–1 which is higher
than azo-COPs (1.2–1.5 mmol g–1) and azo-POFs
(1.2–1.5 mmol g–1) but slightly lower than
ALP-1 (3.2 mmol g–1) and ALP-5 (2.94 mmol g–1). This is due to the triptycene-based framework of
ALP-1 which results in high IMFV, enhancing the total uptake at 1
bar, while ALP-5 has a high binding affinity to CO2 because
of its narrow pore size. The CH4 uptake of Azo-Py at 1
bar was recorded at 1.54 and 0.89 mmol g–1 at 273
and 298 K, respectively. This was higher than all pyrene-derived BILPs41 and all ALPs except ALP-1. The binding affinity
of Azo-Py for gas molecules was quantified via isosteric heat of adsorption, Qst, by fitting the CO2 and CH4 isotherms at 273 and 298 K, respectively, with the virial
equation. The CO2Qst value
for Azo-Py at zero surface coverage was quantified to be 27.5 kJ mol–1. From the Qst curves
generated (Figure 3), it is evident that the strength of interaction between gas molecules
and the polymer pore walls decreases with more loading as the interaction
sites and pore volumes are increasingly saturated. The Qst for CH4 was calculated to be 22.6 kJ mol–1 with depreciation in binding affinity observed with
increasing gas loading as well.

at the mole ratio of 10:90 for CO2/N2 and the
mole ratio of 50:50 for CO2/CH4 at 273 and 298
K.

Motivated by the azo-functionality,
microporous nature, high CO2 uptake, and suitable binding
affinity of Azo-Py, the selective
CO2 capture potential of Azo-Py was evaluated from the
analysis of single gas isotherms of CO2, CH4, and N2 using two methods: Henry’s law constants
and the ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST). Henry’s law
constants were obtained from the initial slope of the adsorption branch
of the isotherms (Figure S5a–d).
The CO2/N2 selectivities were found to be 39.6
(273 K) and 29.2 (298 K), whereas CO2/CH4 selectivities
were 7.04 (273 K) and 4.8 (298 K). IAST is a widely recognized method
for deducing the selective gas capture behavior of porous sorbents
from single gas isotherms while considering the composition of the
targeted gas mixtures at adsorption conditions. In this case, flue
gas composed predominantly of CO2 and N2 with
ratios of CO2/N2 at 10:90 and landfill gas composed
predominantly of CO2 and CH4 with ratios of
CO2/CH4 at 50:50 were analyzed (Figure 4). For flue gas compositions,
the CO2/N2 IAST selectivity of Azo-Py at 1 bar
was calculated at 55.1 and 42.4 at 273 and 298 K, respectively. These
values are comparable to other nitrogen-bearing organic polymers ALPs,2,30 BILPs,46 and functionalized NPOFs.24 The decrease in selectivity from 273 to 298
K is a trend that has been observed before in POPs that lack the presence
of a large portion of pores in the mesoporous range.47,48 The CO2/CH4 selectivity of Azo-Py at 1 bar
was 10.9 and 7.8 for 273 and 298 K, respectively. These values are
also comparable to our previously published azo-functionalized polymers.

3.4 Photoluminescence
and Metal-Sensing Studies
The structural architecture of
Azo-Py consists of a two-dimensional
-network of pyrene-based backbone linked through the azo-group moieties.
This provides a π-electron-rich conjugated system with strong
emission intensities, similar to that of pyrene. Figure 5 shows the fluorescence profile
of Azo-Py, which is similar to that of pure pyrene in acetonitrile.
Azo-Py exhibits mainly a monomer emission peak at ∼415 nm with
a less significant excimer emission at ∼490 nm.36,49 Perturbations of the electronic distribution of the π-electrons
in this conjugated system through the electrostatic interaction of
metal ions would change the emission profile of the polymer;50,51 hence, the azopyrene polymers can be utilized as a fluorescent chemical
sensor for metal ions.

Figure 5 Excitation (dotted lines) and the emission (solid lines)
spectra
for pyrene (λexc = 360 nm and λemi = 395 nm) and Azo-Py (λexc = 360 nm and λemi = 415 nm), respectively.

To test the efficacy of Azo-Py as a sensor for metal ions,
we investigated
the effect of the presence of sodium, potassium, calcium, mercury,
lead, thallium, and aluminum ions on the emission of the polymer in
solution. Millimolar concentrations of each metal’s salt solution
were titrated into a uniform suspension of the azopyrene polymer in
acetonitrile (0.1 mg/mL), and the fluorescence spectrum of the polymer
was monitored after every addition. Figure 6 shows the change in the fluorescence profile
of the polymer upon addition of mercuric bromide solution; as the
concentration of the metal increased, the emission of the polymer
decreased. Similar trends of emission quenching of the polymer were
also observed with the other metals (Figures S6–S8 in the Supporting Information document) but to different
extents.

Figure 6 Emission spectra of Azo-Py (1.0 mg/mL) with successive additions
of mercuric bromide (0.1 M) in acetonitrile.

Figure 7A
displays
Stern–Volmer plots for the relative change in the monomer emission
of the polymer versus the increase in the concentration of the metal
ions. The observed linear trends for the quenching of the fluorescence
by the metal ions demonstrate that the strongest effects (Table 3) are for aluminum
(KSV = 152 M–1) and
mercury (KSV = 143 M–1) ions versus weaker effects for lead (KSV = 32 M–1) and thallium (KSV = 19 M–1) ions, whereas sodium, potassium,
and calcium ions exhibit insignificant effects on the emission of
Azo-Py.36 Similar linear trends (Figure 7B) are also attainable
for Benesi–Hildebrand plots, where the reciprocal of the change
in the fluorescence intensity of the polymer is plotted versus the
reciprocal of the metal concentrations. The linear fitting of these
plots has provided the binding constants (Table 3) of the polymer to the metal ions, assuming
a 1:1 binding ratio between the metal ion and each pyrene unit in
the polymer. The obtained values indicated that interaction of aluminum
(KS = 376 M–1) and mercury
(KS = 183 M–1) ions
with the polymer is stronger than that of lead (KS = 121 M–1) and thallium (KS = 112 M–1) ions, similar to conclusions
based upon Stern–Volmer plots. We attribute this strong interaction
and quenching effect of aluminum ions to their strong electrostatic
attraction to the polymer (through azo-metal binding) because of the
high concentration of charge, whereas for mercury ions it is due to
the heavy atom effect resulting from spin–orbit coupling associated
with cation-π coordination that disrupts excimer formation,
consistent with the fluorescence spectral profile change, and quenches
both the monomer and excimer fluorescence bands to different extents.
Meanwhile, the low quenching effect of lead and thallium ions could
be due to the hydration effect of the metal, which decreases the electrostatic
metal-π binding.50,51 Unlike Hg(II), these ions include
valence electrons in the 6th shell, which could adversely impact the
cation-π coordination via an electrostatic repulsive component.
Finally, the hard ions of sodium, potassium, and calcium have very
low affinity to both nitrogen atoms (azo group) and π-conjugated
surfaces.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion, a new azo-functionalized porous organic polymer,
Azo-Py, was synthesized by incorporating a highly conjugated pyrene
core into the polymer framework. The influence of the pyrene moiety
in the solid-state packing of the polymer is evident by the formation
of nanofibers that are assembled by strong π–π
stacking interactions manifest by excimer bands in the fluorescence
spectra. Azo-Py displays high porosity with a surface area of 1259
m2 g–1 and high microporosity as a result
of the rigid pyrene core. These characteristics induce high CO2 uptakes of 4.79 mmol g–1 (273 K) and 2.89
mmol g–1 (298 K) at 1 bar along with binding affinities
conducive for easy regeneration, Qst =
27.5 kJ mol–1. Furthermore, Azo-Py because of its
highly conjugated electron density has the ability to sense the electropositive
heavy metal cations more selectively than harder cations. The ionic
charge, atomic weight, and binding constant of the metal cation play
a role in determining the extent of fluorescence quenching of the
polymer’s monomeric and excimeric pyrene-based emission bands.
