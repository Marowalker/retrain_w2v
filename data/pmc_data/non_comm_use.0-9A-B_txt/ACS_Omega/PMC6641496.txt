Following on our
60-year research on the chemical constituents
of the rain forest trees Galbulimima belgraveana and Galbulimima baccata, we report
the isolation of seven new alkaloids: GB14 (14), GB22
(15), GB25 (16), GB21 (17),
GB23 (18), GB24 (19), and GB26 (20). Their structures were elucidated by a combination of spectroscopic
analyses and single-crystal X-ray crystallography, as well as structure
degradation and interconversion. The newly isolated alkaloids are
precursors or derivatives of the known family members from our early
studies and could be intermediates in the biosynthesis of the Galbulimima alkaloids. Therefore, the present study
has expanded the range of structures in this family of alkaloids and
provided some missing links in the biosynthetic sequences.

Introduction
Galbulimima
belgraveana and Galbulimima baccata are large aromatic evergreen
trees that grow in thick mountain rainforests in Papua New Guinea,
Indonesia, and Northern Australia.1 These
trees are a hallucinogenic plant and have been used by native tribes
in religious ceremonies and treated as herbal medicines to induce
deep sleep or relieve abdominal pains.2 The phytochemistry of both G. belgraveana and G. baccata has been extensively
studied and revealed that the bark of both species is a rich source
of alkaloids, viz., Galbulimima alkaloids.3 The pioneering research conducted by us led to
the isolation of 28 Galbulimima alkaloids,
22 of which have been characterized via a combination of spectroscopic
analysis, structure degradation, and interconversion, as well as semisynthesis.4 Following the early studies, we have reported
the structures assigned to five of the remaining six alkaloids and
two new family members in 20095 and 2011,6 leading to 29 members that have been characterized.
Although significant structural diversity exists within this alkaloid
family, all the members possess a trans-decalin system and a piperidine
ring, and they could be classified into four distinct subgroups (representative
structures of four classes are shown in Figure 1). Most of the class I alkaloids (nine members)
possess a δ-lactone annulated to a trans-decalin moiety, represented
by himbacine (1) and himgravine (2) from
early studies. The newly isolated class I members GB18 (3) and GB20 (4) slightly differ as the carbon tether
connecting the trans-decalin and the piperidine ring is linked with
C-7. The class II compounds (15 members) are structurally more complex
in terms of their fused ring systems, and the piperidine ring is linked
to the decalin moiety via an additional bond. Himandrine (5), himandridine (6), GB12 (7), and GB1
(8) are typical class II members, and this subgroup contains
approximately one-half of all Galbulimima alkaloids isolated and characterized so far. The class III members
(three alkaloids) differ from class II ones on the connectivity between
the piperidine unit and the trans-decalin system, and this subclass
includes GB13 (9), himbadine (10), and himgaline
(11). The class IV members (two alkaloids), also known
as “Miscellaneous” alkaloids, structurally vary from
the other classes and have little resemblance to each other, represented
by GB17 (12) and GB16 (13).7

Detailed biological evaluation
of Galbulimima alkaloids revealed some
fascinating properties, for instance, the
class I alkaloid himbacine (1) was found to be a strong
muscarinic receptor antagonist.8 Because
antagonists of the muscarinic receptors elevate the level of acetylcholine,
this means that himbacine could act as a potential therapeutics for
the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease.9 Moreover, structural modification of himbacine led to the development
of vorapaxar (SCH 530348), a thrombin receptor antagonist, which has
been approved by the FDA to treat patients with peripheral arterial
disease in 2014.10 Because of their fascinating
structural features as well as potential pharmacological applications,
the Galbulimima alkaloids have attracted
considerable attention from the synthetic community. The total syntheses
of eight representative members, that is, himbacine,11 himbeline,11a himandravine,12 himandrine,13 GB13,14 himgaline,14c,14d GB16,14f and GB17,12b,15 have been
completed by creative synthetic endeavor.7,16 Meanwhile,
the biogenesis of the Galbulimima alkaloids
has been discussed extensively within these synthetic works.17,14b

Our continuing efforts to explore the
chemical constituents from G. belgraveana and G. baccata have led to some interesting
findings. Herein, we report the isolation
and structure elucidation of seven new alkaloids, namely, GB14 (14), GB22 (15), GB25 (16), GB21
(17), GB23 (18), GB24 (19),
and GB26 (20). Compounds 14–16 (Figure 2) were obtained from
the extracts of the bark, whereas the remaining four alkaloids 17–20 (Figure 3) were isolated from the methanol extracts of fresh leaves
of G. baccata. GB14 (14), GB25 (16), and GB24 (19) are new
class II members, GB22 (15) is an oxygenated derivative
of class III alkaloid himdabine (10), and GB21 (17) could be regarded as the precursor of class I alkaloids
GB21 (4) and GB26 (20), whereas GB23 (18) is a precursor of known class I member himgravine (2).

Results and Discussion
Like all the Galbulimima alkaloids
identified so far, the new compounds 14–16 were
isolated from the bark extracts of G. belgraveana and G. baccata. GB14 (14) was obtained as a white amorphous solid, which was recrystallized
from methanol to give a white crystalline solid. Its molecular formula
was determined as C22H33NO5, according
to its electron ionization mass spectrometry (HREIMS) peak at m/z 416.2438 [M + H]+. The infrared
(IR) spectrum showed two absorption bands at 1740 and 1692, corresponding
to two ester functions. The 13C NMR spectra showed GB14
to possess two ester functional groups at C-16 and C-17 (δc 170.7 and δc 169.3) and one tetrasubstituted
double bond (δc 164.7 and δc 116.0).
The methyl signals at δH 3.74 (H-22), δH 2.03 (OAc-16), and δH 1.32 (H-1) as well
as the absence of the N-methyl group indicated that this compound
could be a class II alkaloid with an acetate function. The doublet
at δH 5.61 (J = 8.5 Hz) suggested
that the acetate be located at C-16. After the comparison of the NMR
data with class II alkaloid himandrine (5), we were then
able to arrive at a gross structure 14. Furthermore,
the unequivocal stereochemical assignments (including the absolute
configuration) were confirmed via single-crystal X-ray analysis (see
the Supporting Information for details).

The NMR spectra of GB22 were puzzling at first because there was
one benzene proton at δH 6.59 (H-17), yet no ester
or double bond signals were observed. N-Methyl at
the piperidine ring could be found at δH 1.96 (H-21);
however, the obvious upfield shift of the methyl at C-2 (δH 0.78) indicated the presence of a benzenoid B ring. Its molecular
formula C21H29NO2 derived from HREIMS
was extremely similar to that of class III alkaloid himbadine (10) (C21H31NO2). We concluded,
therefore, that the new alkaloid was the aromatized derivative of
himbadine, and the final structure 15 as well as the
absolute configuration was determined by single-crystal X-ray analysis
(see the Supporting Information for details).
To shed more light on this transformation, various oxidation conditions
were applied on himbadine (10) with the hope of forming
GB22 directly; however, it turned out that this requires an unusual
procedure (Scheme 1). Compound 10 was oxidized by H2SO4 in acetic anhydride to afford himbadine acetate (21) as the major product (47%) and GB22 diacetate (22)
as the minor one (27%), and the latter compound was then hydrolyzed
to give the final target 15 in a good yield (84%).

Scheme 1 Semisynthesis of GB22 (15) from Himbadine (10)
GB25 (16) was obtained as a white amorphous solid
with a molecular formula C22H31NO4. When its NMR spectra were compared with those of GB14 (14), it was apparent that GB25 had almost the same structural features
except for the presence of an acetate group. The structure was assigned
to compound 16 and again was confirmed by single-crystal
X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information for details).

After three new family members were identified
from the bark extracts,
we then turned our attention to the alkaloid components from the other
parts that remain unexplored, that is, the fresh leaves, to search
for new members or metabolites, which resulted in the isolation of
four new alkaloids. GB21 (17) was the first sample obtained,
and it was a white, crystalline solid with a molecular formula C21H31NO2. Structural features from the
NMR spectra include a usual piperidine ring system lacking an N-methyl
group, a trisubstituted double bond (δc 143.4, 131.4;
δH 6.75, t, J = 3.7 Hz) conjugated
to a lactone-type carbonyl group (δc 169.5), and
a tertiary methyl group (δH 1.01) which indicated
a class I alkaloid. Fitting these data to a GB20-like6 skeleton, we arrived at structure 17 which
was confirmed by single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information for details). Our sample
of GB23 (18) had a molecular formula of C21H31NO2, and its NMR spectra were quite similar
to that of class I alkaloid (+)-himgravine except for the absence
of the N-methyl group. We concluded, therefore, that the new alkaloid
was (+)-desmethylhimgravine, whose structure was again confirmed by
single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information for details).

The third new alkaloid obtained
was GB24 (19), a white
amorphous solid, and its molecular formula was determined as C22H29NO4. NMR spectra revealed one ketone
(δc 196.2) being conjugated to a tetrasubstituted
double bond (δc 168.4 and δc 121.3)
and one ester carbonyl group (δc 173.4). We assumed
the methyl signal (δH 3.85) to be a methyl ester
that was attached to the double bond. The spectra varied from the
class IV member GB165 (13)
to the typical class III member GB13 (9) which possessed
α,β-unsaturated ketone. Comparisons of both the 1H and 13C NMR spectra with those of GB25 (16) showed the best similarities. However, the structure could not
be elucidated because of insufficient functional signals. Fortunately,
treatment of the sample with HCl produced a salt that appeared to
be a good crystal, and the single-crystal X-ray analysis confirmed
the structure to be compound 19 (see the Supporting Information for details). To provide
more materials for further biological evaluation, we conducted semisyntheses
of GB24 (19), GB25 (16), and GB14 (14), and the three closely related members, from class II
alkaloid GB12 (7), were obtained by early studies (Scheme 2). Hydrolyzing the
triacetate of compound 7 in K2CO3 and methanol conditions afforded triol 23 in a good
yield, and the allylic hydroxy group was then oxidized selectively
by MnO2 to produce ketone 24 (98%). Removal
of the hydroxy group at the C-14 position was investigated by radical
deoxygenation; however, the required thiocarbonylimidazolide compound 25 could only be prepared by a solid-state reaction with thiocarbonyldiimidazole
(TCDI) in the presence of 3 equiv dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP) at
80 °C.18 The so-obtained intermediate 25 was then submitted to a radical cleavage with tri-n-butyltin hydride (Bu3SnH) and azabisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) in toluene to give the expected GB24 (19) in a
50% yield and a reduced product 24 (20%). GB24 was then
reduced by NaBH4 to afford GB25 (15) in a
75% yield, and the latter compound was then converted to GB14 (14) via the acetylation condition (71%).

Scheme 2 Semisyntheses of
GB25 (19), GB24 (16),
and GB14 (14) from GB12 (7)
The last alkaloid GB26 had a molecular formula
C21H33NO4, and it was the most polar
member during column
chromatography, assuming it possessed some polar functional groups.
It had the same carbon number with GB21 (17); furthermore,
NMR spectra showed some similarities with those of 17: a usual piperidine ring system lacking an N-methyl group, a trisubstituted
double bond (δc 137.3, 136.8; δH 6.01, s at C-16 and C-17) conjugated to a carbonyl group (δc 173.9, C-21), and a tertiary methyl group (δH 1.03). However, 13C NMR indicated that there are four
quaternary carbons (δc 173.9, 136.8, 81.4, and 67.6),
and the proton NMR suggested that there are two tertiary hydroxyl
groups at C-15 (δH 6.22, δc 67.6)
and C-19 (δH 5.60, δc 81.4). After
comparing the data with those of GB206 (4), we then arrived at the structure of GB21 (17) possessing an additional hydroxyl at C-15, and the second tertiary
hydroxyl at C-19 could be derived from the ring opening of lactone,
which also resulted in the release of carboxylic acid at C-17, all
of those could attribute to the significant polarity of this compound.
With the combined data, we finally came to a unique structure 20. Initially, we wanted to confirm the proposed structure
via single-crystal X-ray analysis; however, evaporation of solutions
of this sample in various solvent systems failed to afford a suitable
material for single-crystal X-ray analysis. Then, this compound was
treated with HCl (4 M solution in dioxane) followed by being dissolved
in a CH2Cl2/MeOH/EtOAc system. Upon evaporating,
a material suitable for single-crystal X-ray analysis (see the Supporting Information for details) was obtained,
which was determined to be diene 26, an eliminated derivative
of compound 20 (Scheme 3). Therefore, the final structure as well as the absolute
configuration of compound 26 was confirmed. However,
because of the very small amounts of the material obtained, no other
spectral data could be acquired on this diene.

Scheme 3 Derivatization of
Compound 20, Leading to Diene 26
There has been a great deal
of speculation about the biogenesis
of the Galbulimima alkaloids, and in
most of the postulated biosyntheses, the putative polyene 27 (Figure 4) serves
as a common precursor and undergoes regiodivergent Diels–Alder
cycloaddition to establish the alkaloid skeleton. This hypothesis
has been supported by elegant biomimetic syntheses of the class I
member himbadine (1),11g class
III alkaloid GB13 (9),14b and
class IV member GB17 (12).12b We believe that an intramolecular [4 + 2] cycloaddition of polyene 27 following path a (Figure 4) would lead to intermediate 30, which
underwent an imine reduction, and lactone formation process could
deliver GB23 (18) and then himgravine (2). Alternatively, coiling of polyene 27 in the cycloaddition
process following path b would afford intermediate 31 with different stereochemistry. A Michael reaction on the latter
compound would deliver a new cyclopentanone compound 32, which could be converted to enone 33 after proton
shift and the oxidation process. An enamine-based aldol reaction between
the cyclopentanone and the piperidine ring would then result in pentacycle 34, and in their total syntheses of himandrine (5) and GB13 (9), Movassaghi13 and Evans14d showed that such a sequence
was feasible. This common intermediate 34 en route to
class II members passes through GB24 (19) and to other
ones, that is, GB14 (14), GB25
(19), himandrine (5), himandridine (6), GB12 (7), and GB1 (8) after
decarboxylation, oxidation, and other associated processes. Compound 31 could also serve as a precursor to class I alkaloid GB21
(17) after a reduction/cyclization sequence, and the
latter compound could then be oxidized followed by acetylation to
give GB20 (4). Hydrolysis on both the lactone ring and
the acetamide on GB20 would deliver the new member GB26 (20). The biosynthesis of class IV member GB17 (12) requires
an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction (IMDA) on the polyene
structure such as 35 that could be derived from polyene 27 via path c. In this way, the intermediate 36 from which an azachrysene framework could plausibly be formed, it
would serve as a precursor to GB17 (12). In a recent
biomimetic total synthesis of GB17, Thomson12b employed a precursor similar to that of 35, and the
computational investigations indicated that because of the competing
orbital interaction and distortion energies, such an IMDA process
showed low regioselectivity.

Conclusions
The work detailed here has expanded the range
of structures in
the Galbulimima alkaloid family, although
no new skeleton was found. Most of the new members isolated could
be regarded as metabolites or precursors of the known alkaloids. Nevertheless,
the isolation and identification of these new family members have
shed more light on the biosynthesis route of the Galbulimima alkaloids, which has been proved by the semisynthesis of GB22 (15) and the interconversions of GB14 (14), GB25
(16), and GB24 (19). The present work has
also found some missing links in the biosynthetic sequences. Our current
efforts are focused on undertaking a comprehensive biological evaluation
of the new alkaloids we have isolated to date. Results will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
General Experimental Protocols
All reagents and solvents
were of commercial grade and purified prior to use when necessary.
Thin-layer chromatography was performed on aluminum-backed 0.2 mm
thick silica gel 60 F254 plates as supplied by Merck. Visualization
was accomplished with UV light and/or the use of ninhydrin or potassium
permanganate solution followed by brief heating with a heat gun. Flash
chromatographic separations were carried out with silica gel 60 (40–63
μm) as the stationary phase and using the solvents indicated.
IR spectra (νmax) were recorded on a PerkinElmer
1800 Series Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Samples were
applied to KBr plates as CDCl3 solutions followed by generous
air drying. Melting points were measured on an Optimelt automated
melting point system and are uncorrected. 1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker spectrometer operating at
400 MHz for proton and 100 MHz for carbon nuclei. Chemical shifts
are reported in parts per million relative to residual solvent peaks
as an internal standard at the following chemical shifts (1H and 13C, respectively): 7.26 and 77.0 ppm for CDCl3. Data are reported as follows: chemical shift, multiplicity
(s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, p = pentet, qd
= quartet of doublets, br = broad, and m = multiplet), coupling constant
(Hz), integration, and assigned position. Low-resolution electrospray
ionization (ESI) mass spectra were recorded on a single quadrupole
liquid chromatograph–mass spectrometer, and high-resolution
measurements were recorded on a time-of-flight instrument. Low- and
high-resolution EI mass spectra were recorded on a magnetic sector
machine. Wherever necessary, reactions were performed under a nitrogen
atmosphere.

Plant Materials
G.
belgraveana bark was acquired at Aiyura on the eastern
highlands of New Guinea
in August 1951. A voucher specimen (sample no. 5091) was housed within
the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (C.S.I.R.O.),
Australia. G. baccata bark was collected
near Boonjie, North Queensland, in August 1947. A voucher specimen
(sample no. 4273) was housed within the C.S.I.R.O. The plant materials
were identified by Messrs. J. G. Tracey and L. J. Webb at C.S.I.R.O.
and Mr. J. S. Womersley, Department of Forests, Lae. G. baccata leaf material was obtained from the Royal
Botanic Gardens, Sydney, NSW, Australia. The leaves were harvested
on May 15, 2012, and a voucher specimen (catalogue number: 05-79352)
was deposited at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, NSW, Australia.
The plant materials were identified by Dr. Benjamin Thomas.

Isolation
of Compounds 9–15
Compounds 9–11 were isolated from the bark extracts from G. belgraveana and G. baccata left by our early
studies.4 The crude
bark extracts were obtained by using the following procedure: the
shade-dried milled bark (10 kg) was exhausted with cold methanol (20
L) three times before being filtered, and the filtrate was concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude bark extracts were suspended in
5% NaOH aqueous solution (3 L) and were extracted with ether (3 ×
3 L). The dark aqueous alkaline solution was discarded, and the organic
layer was then extracted with 4% HCl (3 × 3 L). The acid extract
was washed with ether (3 × 1 L), basified with ammonia to reach
a pH value of 10, and then the liberated bases were extracted with
chloroform (3 × 3 L). Evaporation of the dried organic layer
gave a thick brown oil, which was subjected to gradient chromatography
or recrystallization to yield the previously reported Galbulimima alkaloids. The unseparated mixtures were
then stored under ambient temperature at the Research School of Chemistry
and the Australian National University since 1970s. Gradient chromatography
(silica, 1:10:0.1 to 5:10:0.1 v/v/v methanol/dichloromethane/NH3 elution) on these mixtures afforded new compounds 14 (35 mg), 15 (18 mg), and 16 (26 mg). Compounds 17–20 were obtained from the fresh leaf extracts from G. baccata using the following procedure: the fresh
leaves of G. baccata (3 kg) were treated
with liquid nitrogen and then crushed in the meantime, and after being
warmed to room temperature, the residues were percolated with methanol
(10 L) three times at 25 °C. The solution was then filtered,
and the filtrates combined were concentrated under reduced pressure.
The crude extract (300 g) was suspended in 5% NaOH aqueous solution
(1 L) and was extracted with ether (3 × 1 L). The separated organic
layer was further extracted with 4% HCl (3 × 1 L). The acid extract
was washed with ether (3 × 500 mL), basified with ammonia to
reach a pH value of 10, and then extracted with dichloromethane (3
× 500 mL). Evaporation of the dried organic layer gave a thick
brown oil (2.7 g), which was subjected to gradient chromatography
(silica, 1:10:0.1 to 5:10:0.1 v/v/v methanol/dichloromethane/NH3 elution) to afford the three major fractions A (450 mg),
B (670 mg), and C (810 mg). Further purification on fraction A using
1:10:0.1 v/v/v methanol/dichloromethane/NH3 elution afforded
compound 17 (56 mg) and compound 118 (120
mg); purification on fraction C using 2:10:0.1 v/v/v methanol/dichloromethane/NH3 elution gave compound 19 (35 mg); the most polar
fraction C was purified several times by 3:10:0.1 v/v/v methanol/dichloromethane/NH3 elution to afford compound 20 (265 mg).

A magnetically
stirred mixture of himbadine (10) (1.5 g, 4.55 mmol)
in acetic anhydride (50 mL) was treated with 98% sulfuric acid (0.5
mL). The solution was heated at 80 °C for 36 h under nitrogen
atmosphere. Acetic anhydride was distilled off under reduced pressure,
and the residue was then dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL) and
basified by NaOH (50 mL of a 10% aqueous solution). The organic layers
were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The resulting brown residue was subjected
to chromatography (silica, 20:1 v/v CH2Cl2/MeOH
elution) to afford two fractions. Concentration of fraction A (Rf = 0.9) gave himbadine acetate 21 (0.8 g, 47%) as a yellow oil, [α]D20 = −4.6 (c 1.8,

Compound 25
Following a reported protocol,18 a magnetically stirred mixture of ketone 24 (380 mg,
0.98 mmol) in Et2O (5 mL) was treated
with TCDI (530 mg, 3.0 mmol) and DMAP (370 mg, 3.0 mmol). The solvent
was evaporated, and the resulting oil was heated at 80 °C for
5 h. The black residue was subjected to chromatography (silica, 50:1
v/v CH2Cl2/MeOH elution) to afford, after concentration
of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.7),
thionoester 25 (400 mg, 83%) as a yellow amorphous solid,
[α]D20 = +215.5 (c 0.45, CHCl3). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.27 (s, 1H, H-2″),

GB24 (19)
A magnetically stirred mixture
of thionoester 25 (320 mg, 0.64 mmol) in dry toluene
(20 mL) at 100 °C was treated with AIBN (5.25 mg, 0.0032 mmol)
and Bu3SnH (0.21 mL, 0.77 mmol). After stirring under the
same temperature for 16 h, further portions of AIBN (10.5 mg, 0.0064
mmol) and Bu3SnH (0.21 mL, 0.77 mmol) were added. The reaction
mixture was stirred for another 2 h before being concentrated under
reduced pressure. The resulting yellow residue was subjected to chromatography
(silica, 50:1 v/v CH2Cl2/MeOH elution) to afford
two fractions. Concentration of fraction A (Rf = 0.55) gave GB24 (120 mg, 50%) as a white amorphous solid.
The structural data were, in all respects, similar to those of an
authentic sample from isolation work. Concentration of fraction B
(Rf = 0.50) gave a white amorphous solid
tentatively identified as ketone 24 (50 mg, 20%).

GB25
(16)
A magnetically stirred mixture
of compound 19 (100 mg, 0.27 mmol) in EtOH (6 mL) at
0 °C was treated with NaBH4 (102 mg, 2.70 mmol). The
mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 2 h before being quenched
by Na2CO3 (10 mL of a 1 M aqueous solution),
and the solution was then extracted by CH2Cl2 (3 × 50 mL). The combined organic layers were dried (Na2SO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced
pressure. The colouless oil was subjected to chromatography (silica,
50:2 v/v CH2Cl2/MeOH elution) to afford, after
concentration of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.4), GB25 (75 mg, 75%) as a white amorphous solid. The structural
data were, in all respects, similar to those of an authentic sample
from isolation work.

GB14 (14)
A magnetically
stirred mixture
of compound 16 (50 mg, 0.13 mmol) in pyridine (6 mL)
was treated with Ac2O (122 μL, 1.30 mmol) and DMAP
(1.6 mg, 0.013 mmol). The mixture was stirred and heated at 70 °C
for 14 h before being concentrated under high vacuum. The yellow oil
so-formed was subjected to chromatography (silica, 50:2 v/v CH2Cl2/MeOH elution) to afford, after concentration
of the relevant fractions (Rf = 0.6),
GB14 (40 mg, 71%) as a white amorphous solid. The structural data
were, in all respects, similar to those of an authentic sample from
isolation work.
