As one of the most
promising photoanode materials for photoelectrochemical
(PEC) water oxidation, earth-abundant hematite has been severely restricted
by its poor electrical conductivity, poor charge separation, and sluggish
oxygen evolution reaction kinetics. FeO has an ability to produce
hydrogen, while its preparation needs high temperature to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ by using H2 or CO gases. Here,
Fe2O3- and FeO-based nanorods (NRs) on fluorine-doped
tin oxide (FTO) substrate have been prepared, where the latter was
obtained by doping Sn4+ ions in FeOOH to reduce Fe3+ ions to Fe2+. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements indicate that the dominant
content of Fe element on the surface of Sn-doped Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH samples is Fe2+. FeO-based NRs have
a Fe3O2/FeO heterostructure with some SnO2 nanoparticles distributed on their surface. These prepared
samples were used as PEC photoanodes under a visible-light irradiation.
The results showed that the modified FeO-based NRs have a photocurrent
density of 0.2 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs reference hydrogen
electrode (RHE) using Hg/HgO electrode as the reference electrode.
Furthermore, they also have a better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution
activity with a rate of 2.3 μmol h–1 cm–1. The improved photocurrent and photocatalytic activity
can be ascribed to the Sn-dopant, as the introduction of Sn4+ not only leads to the formation of the Fe3O2/FeO heterostructure but also increases the carrier concentration.
Fe3O2/FeO heterostructure with SnO2 nanoparticles on its surface has a good band energy alignment, which
is beneficial to the PEC water oxidation and reduction.

Introduction
With stability in aqueous
solution, favorable band gap (2.1 eV),
and vast abundance, hematite (α-Fe2O3)
is regarded as one of the most promising photoanode materials for
photoelectrochemical (PEC) water oxidation.1−3 Due to its poor
electrical conductivity, poor charge separation and transfer efficiency,
and sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics, the performance
of the hematite photoanode for water oxidation needs to be furthermore
improved.

Element doping4−7 in hematite (α-Fe2O3)
was regarded as
an efficient method to improve water photo-oxidation. Sn4+ is a tetravalent dopant that can be substitutionally doped into
hematite at the Fe3+ sites,8−10 and the electrical conductivity
of Sn-doped hematite can be enhanced by the occurrence of bivalent
ions, Fe2+, where the local pairs of Fe2+–Sn4+ play the role of donor centers in hematite, causing enhanced
electroconductivity,11 and at the same
time, retarding the electron–hole recombination.12 Gonçalves et al.13 prepared hematite thin films with high PEC performance of 2.7 mA–2 at 1.23 VRHE by using the colloidal nanocrystal
deposition process, while the samples were sintered over 800 °C.
Tang et al.14 have constructed Fe2O3 related multilayer nanowires to enhance PEC water splitting
by tuning the surface state. Ma et al.15 adopted low-temperature hydrogen annealing combined with high-temperature
quenching in air to realize self-diffused Sn doping in α-Fe2O3 nanorod (NR) photoanodes, where photocurrent
densities of 1.35 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs reference
hydrogen electrode (RHE) and 1.91 mA cm–2 at 1.4
V vs RHE were obtained. Li et al.16 shed
light on the improvement of carrier conductivity by combing orientation
control and transition metal doping by a magnetic field method. Zhang
et al.17 fabricated Sn-doped hematite films
via mid-situ and ex situ doping methods to improve PEC performances,
where the Sn-doped hematite films on the fluorine-doped tin oxide
(FTO) substrate were synthesized by soaking the FeOOH film in the
tin salt aqueous solution followed by thermal treatment. Guo et al.18 obtained a photocurrent of 5.7 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs RHE. By changing temperatures and atmospheres, Wang
et al. studied the electrical and thermomechanical properties of undoped
and Sn-doped α-Fe2O3 nanoscale powders
to investigate their transport and defect properties.19 Rani et al.20 studied the different
Sn-doped α-Fe2O3 (Sn = 0, 10, 20, 30 wt
%) photoanodes to improve properties of PEC water splitting. Grave
et al.21 studied the orientation dependence
of the PEC properties on Sn-doped hematite photoanodes and found that
the Sn-doped hematite thin films with (100) and (110) oriented samples
can improve the onset potentials of ∼170 and ∼100 mV.
Li et al.22 studied morphology and doping
engineering of Sn-doped hematite nanowire photoanodes, and an outstanding
photocurrent density of 2.2 mA cm–2 at 0.23 V vs
Ag/AgCl was obtained. In their studies, the prepared samples need
800 °C for annealing treatment, as the high-temperature thermal
annealing will lead to the shrinkage of NWs and the Sn diffusion from
the FTO substrate, which yields a nonuniform distribution of Sn doping
along the hematite NW growth axis. Therefore, they used a silica encapsulation
method to retain the morphology of hematite NWs with a uniform Sn-dopant
distribution along the nanowire growth axis.

Although there
are many discussions on Sn-doped α-Fe2O3 photoanodes to improve properties of PEC water
splitting, the photocurrent is significantly lower than the theoretical
limit of 12.6 mA cm–2 predicted from its band gap
energy.23 The main reasons for the limited
performance of hematite photoanodes have been attributed to short
lifetime,24 electrical properties, and
significant charge recombination. Furthermore, a facile method needing
no high temperature is more welcome.

Another iron oxide is wüstite
(FeO), which has been used
to produce hydrogen in high-temperature solar chemistry.25−28 Most studies on FeO were concentrated on the water chemisorption
and reaction.29,30 As the bulk phase of FeO at room
temperature was reported to be thermodynamically unstable,31 the reported FeO materials were obtained by
reducing hematite in hydrogen or carbon monoxide atmospheres under
high temperature.32,33 It is a fascinating way to prepare
wüstite material by a green method.

As wüstite
has a conduction band energy of 4.33 eV (vs vacuum
energy), wüstite photocatalyst on hydrogen production under
visible-light irradiation is a very interesting topic for discussion.

To study the photocurrent of undoped Fe2O3 and Sn-doped FeO, we prepared three samples: undoped Fe2O3, Sn-doped Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH
NR arrays on the FTO substrate. First, the FeOOH NRs on the FTO substrate
were prepared, FeOOH NRs were annealed at 550 °C for 2 h to obtain
undoped Fe2O3, and then the Fe2O3 NRs were immersed in the Sn-precursor for 24 h at room temperature
and finally sintered at 550 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace under
atmosphere; thus, the Sn-doped Fe2O3 NR arrays
were obtained. When FeOOH NRs were directly immersed in the Sn-precursor
without the annealing treatment, with the same steps, the Sn-FeOOH
NRs were obtained. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) indicate that
the dominant state of Fe in sample Sn-doped and Sn-FeOOH NRs is Fe2+, while in undoped Fe2O3, the main
state of Fe is Fe3+. At the same time, the prepared samples
were used as PEC photoanodes under visible-light irradiation. The
results show that sample Sn-FeOOH has a photocurrent density of ∼40.7
μA cm–2, which is nearly 4-fold of 10.7 μA
cm–2 for Sn-Fe2O3 and nearly
24-fold of undoped Fe2O3 NRs (1.7 μA cm–2). The Sn-FeOOH sample has also a better photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution activity with a rate of 2.3 μmol h–1 cm–1.

Results and Discussion
The fabrication
procedures of Sn–Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH are
illustrated in Figure 1a. Initially, for Sn-FeOOH, the synthesis
process can be separated into two parts: first, a thin film of FeOOH
NR arrays is assembled on the FTO substrate; second, the FTO glass
substrate coated with FeOOH was immersed in the Sn-precursor and sintered
at 550 °C under atmosphere. In contrast, Sn-Fe2O3 undergoes an annealing procedure of FeOOH NR arrays on the
FTO substrate before immersion of the Sn-precursor. Finally, the Fe2O3 NR arrays coated with Sn-precursor are sintered
at 550 °C under atmosphere. Unintentionally, Sn-doped- and SnO2 nanoparticle-packed Fe2O3/FeO hierarchical
NR arrays were obtained. Figure S1 is the
photograph of the obtained Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NR arrays; we can observe that
the surface of the entire FTO glass substrates is uniformly covered
with the red thin film.

process of Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH
and (b) X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH grown on FTO substrate.

To determine the crystal structure of the synthesized
samples,
XRD measurement was carried out and the result is presented in Figure 1b. Figure 1b shows the XRD patterns of
Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH
samples. After subtracting the diffraction peaks originating from
the FTO substrate, the extra peaks located at 2θ values 35.61
and 63.99° can be ascribed to the (110) and (300) crystal plane
of Fe2O3 (JCPDS card number 33-0664). Apart
from the peaks from Fe2O3 and the FTO substrate,
no other diffraction peaks are found from these annealed-treated samples.
Specifically, both patterns only show a strong (110) peak and a weak
(300) peak, indicating that the growth axis of these hematite NR arrays
are highly oriented along the [110] direction vertical to the FTO
substrate. Significantly, it has been reported that hematite has a
strong anisotropic conductivity, which has 4 orders of magnitude higher
along the [110] direction than the orthogonal direction.34,35 XRD patterns show that the peaks of the Sn-doped samples are identical
to those of the undoped Fe2O3. The peak of the
FeO content is not obvious, as its peak overlaps with that of FTO.

The structure and morphology of synthesized NR arrays were further
revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). According to the plan view
and cross-sectional SEM images, oriented and bundled Fe2O3 NR arrays (about 100 nm in diameter) were synthesized
on the FTO substrate (Figure 2a,d). In comparison to the pure Fe2O3 NR arrays, Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NR arrays
sintered at 550 °C under atmosphere faithfully inherit perpendicularly
oriented NRs on FTO. It can also be seen that the surface of the entire
Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NRs is uniformly covered
by the ultrafine SnO2 nanoparticles. The higher magnification
image (Figure 2c) indicates
that the NRs of Sn-FeOOH have a rougher surface with some pores.

on the FTO substrate. (a) and (d) for Fe2O3;
(b) and (e) for Sn-Fe2O3; and (c) and (f) for
Sn-FeOOH.

TEM measurements were used to
further investigate the microstructure
of the Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NRs. To identify
each crystal phase via HRTEM and probe the spatial distribution of
these components in the obtained NRs, we created crystal models based
on the single-crystal date in the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database
(ICSD), as displayed in Figure S2. Figure 3a shows a low-magnification
TEM image of the Sn-Fe2O3 NRs extracted from
the NR arrays on the FTO substrate, which also clearly shows that
the surface of Sn-Fe2O3 NRs was covered with
a small number of nanoparticles. HRTEM images of two selected segments
of a single Sn-Fe2O3 NR are displayed in Figure 3b,c. As shown in Figure 3b, the measured d spacings of 3.34 and 2.64 Å correspond to the (110)
and (101) crystal planes of SnO2 (JCPDS card no. 41-1445),
respectively. The HRTEM and atomic structure detail of the edge region
of an individual NR in Figure 3c demonstrate that the NR is composed of an apparent contrast
between the inner core and the outer shell. Besides, the presence
of continuous lattice fringes throughout the structure confirms the
existence of lattice planes and good crystallinity. Figure 3c reveals a layer of shell
about 2–5 nm thick wrapping the surface of the NR. The crystal
grain on the edge of the outer shell has an interplanar spacing of
2.60 Å, which corresponds to the d-spacing of (002) planes of
FeO (JCPDS card no. 49-1447) consistent with the XRD results. Moreover,
the inner core corresponds to the hexagonal Fe2O3, [R-3c]-space group 167, also known as hematite, with lattice parameters
of a = b = 5.04 Å, c = 13.75 Å, α = β = 90°, and γ
= 120°. Yang et al. had reported that the Fe2+ state
that is induced as Sn4+ is substituted into the Fe3+ site to maintain the charge neutrality of the system.36 Based on the above analysis, Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH samples suggest the existence of the crystal
structure of FeO. Furthermore, Iordanova et al. theoretically showed
that it facilitates the collection of photoexcited electrons along
the nanowire axis via hopping through the Fe2+/Fe3+ mixed valence structure.35

image (a) and high-magnification bright-field
images of the Sn-Fe2O3 NR (b, c) and (d) elemental
mapping images of an individual hybrid NR.

To clarify the elemental composition and distribution throughout
the individual hybrid NR, we also analyzed the same area using EDS.
Fe, Sn, and O atoms were identified from the EDS spectra (Figure 3d), which correspond
to the Fe K-edge, Fe L-edge, Sn K-edge, Sn L-edge, and O K-edge signals,
respectively. In addition, from the TEM and EDS spectra of as-selected
single Sn-FeOOH NR (displayed in Figure S3), a thin film composed of SnO2 particles with a thickness
of tens of nanometers was found. These results indicated the formation
of Fe2O3/FeO heterostructure for Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH samples, where some SnO2 nanoparticles
were sparsely distributed on its surface for Sn-Fe2O3, while SnO2 particles with a thickness of tens
of nanometers had covered the Sn-FeOOH NRs.

UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded to explore the difference
in the absorption for the prepared samples of Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, Sn-FeOOH NR arrays, as shown
in Figure 4a. The absorption
spectra of samples can be extracted from the formula (αhν)2 = c(hν – Eg), where c is a constant and Eg is the band gap,
which can be estimated from a plot of (αhν)2 versus photon energy hν. As shown
in Figure 4b, the extracted
band gap energy is around 2.08–2.09 eV.

and (b) plot of (αhν)2 vs

for as-prepared samples; Survey XPS spectra (c) and XPS spectra of
Fe 3p (d), Sn 3d (e), and O 1s (f) for Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH.

XPS measurements were performed to further investigate the chemical
composition and oxidation state of the Sn-doped Fe2O3 NR arrays. The full survey shown in Figure 4c indicates the presence of Sn, O, and Fe
elements on the surface of Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH
NR arrays, while no Sn element is observed for sample Fe2O3. Peaks located at ∼710 and ∼723 eV can
be assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and 2p1/2, respectively
(in Figure 4d). For
sample Fe2O3, peaks at a low energy ∼710
eV and a high energy 723.8 eV with satellites at 717.8, 731.8, and
741.8 eV could be evidenced as to Fe3+ 2p3/2 and 2p1/2 from Fe2O3. As shown
in Figure S4, the peak at ∼710 eV
can be deconvolved to be 711.4 and 710.6 eV, and a lower one can be
regarded as the content of Fe2+ in Fe2O3 NRs.37 Two typical peaks of Fe3+ at 717.8 and 731.8 eV and the absence of the Fe2+ satellite peak at around 716 eV indicate that the main state of
Fe is Fe3+.

For Sn-Fe2O3 and
Sn-FeOOH samples, a strong
peak at 715.2 eV is the Fe2+ satellite peak. The absence
of two peaks at ∼718 and ∼733 eV indicates38 that the main state of Fe is Fe2+, as shown in Figure 4d. The doping tetravalent ions, Sn4+, can induce the reduction
of Fe3+ to Fe2+, as the individual doping tetravalent
ion Sn4+ needs an extra electron in comparison to Fe3+; in this way, Fe3+ ion becomes Fe2+. The increased Fe2+ content implies that more Sn4+ ions were doped in the samples.39 As the intensity of the peak located at 715.2 eV for Sn-FeOOH is
larger than that of Sn-Fe2O3, it implies more
doped Sn4+ ions in Sn-FeOOH. The peak at ∼710 eV
for the Sn-FeOOH sample can be deconvolved to be 709.9 and 710.9 eV
(shown in Figure S4b), the latter one implies
the existence of Fe3+. This phenomenon is consistent with
the reported in ref (11, 40, 41). At the same time, the Sn-dopant
will shift the binding energy of O 1s spectrum. From the XPS of O
1s spectra (Figure 4f), the peak at 530 eV can be deconvolved two peaks at ∼529
and ∼530 eV (inset of the Figure 4f), the lower energy can be assigned to Fe–O/Sn–O
species, and the one at a higher binding energy of ∼ 530.8
eV is ascribed to surface oxygen. We find that the Sn-FeOOH sample
has the highest oxygen vacancy, while Sn-Fe2O3 has the lowest one, as listed in Table S1, where the deconvolved O 1s spectra of the prepared samples are
displayed. XPS spectra of Sn 3d are displayed in Figure 4e, where the binding energies
at 485.6 and 494.0 eV for Sn-Fe2O3 were ascribed
to Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively. For Sn-FeOOH,
the corresponding binding energy has a 0.2 eV blue shift with respect
to Sn-Fe2O3, that is, binding energies at 485.8
and 494.2 eV to Sn 3d5/2 and 3d3/2, respectively.
The change may be caused by different Sn-doping content.

To
further study the charge-transfer process occurring at the interface
of the photoelectrode/electrolyte, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS)42,43 was carried out and presented in Figure 5a. As shown in Figure 5a, each Nyquist plot
is composed of one semicircle and a slope line; the diameter of the
semicircle at high frequencies represents the charge-transfer resistance
(Rct), which reflects the electron transfer
kinetics of the redox probe at the interface. The slope line at low
frequency is related to the diffusion process. The smaller the slope,
the lower the resistance. Comparing the three samples, Sn-FeOOH has
the lowest resistance and Fe2O3 has the largest
one. The minimum interfacial resistance of Sn-FeOOH NRs indicates
that there are more Fe2+ and Sn3+ ions in Sn-doped
FeO samples, which will be helpful to the photoelectron transferring
from FeO to the FTO substrate along the vertically oriented FTO NRs.

plots of as-prepared samples; (b) capacitive J versus

Hg/HgO in saturated KOH for FTO, Sn-Fe2O3, and
Sn-FeOOH photoanodes collected in the dark and under irradiation of
the 300 W Xe lamp.

Besides the smaller interfacial
resistance, Sn-FeOOH NRs exhibited
a larger electrochemical specific surface area (Figure 5b) due to more SnO2 nanoparticles
on their surface. The PEC measurements were carried out in a three-electrode
configuration in 0.1 M Na2SO4 using Pt wire
as a counter electrode, Ag/AgCl in saturated KCl as a reference electrode,
and the Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NRs on FTO substrates as active photoanodes. The incident
radiation is switched with an on/off interval of 20 s, and 15 repeated
cycles are displayed in Figure 5c, where Fe2O3 NRs display a quite weak
photocurrent of 1.7 μA cm–2 under visible-light
irradiation; Sn-FeOOH sample exhibits a much-enhanced photocurrent
density of ∼40.7 μA cm–2, which is
nearly 4-fold of Sn-Fe2O3 (10.7 μA cm–2). The photocurrent is stable, as there is only a
10% decrease after 15 cycles.

The transient photocurrent decay
was investigated by studying the
photocurrent rise and decline. When the light was switched on, the
electrodes presented a photocurrent spike and exponentially decayed
rapidly to a steady state due to the quick recombination of photogenerated
carriers. The transient decay time can be calculated from a logarithmic
plot of parameter D based on the following formula 1  where It is the
current at time t and Im and Is are the current spike and stabilized
current, respectively. From Figure 5d,e, the transient decay time τ, defined as the
time at which ln D = −1 was obtained, is 0.50,
0.28, and 0.41 s for samples Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NRs, respectively. Longer τ
means a lower rate of carrier recombination and enhanced charge separation.
Photogenerated e-p carriers were more likely to recombine for sample
Sn-Fe2O3. Figure 5f displays the linear sweep voltammetry curves of the
bare FTO, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NRs observed
under dark and light (simulated sunlight) conditions versus Hg/HgO
in saturated KOH. Sn-FeOOH photoanode exhibited a better PEC property
under visible illumination. The photocurrent of Sn-FeOOH reaches 0.2
mA cm–2 (1.23 V vs RHE). The result is larger than
the value obtained with the sample 30% Sn-α-Fe2O3, but lower than the sample 10% Sn-α-Fe2O3 by Rani et al.20 From cyclic voltammetry
(CV) of the three samples at various scan rates, the area surrounded
with the CV curve of sample Sn-FeOOH is obviously larger than those
of the other two samples, indicating better capacitance of that sample,
as shown in Figure S5d–f.

Furthermore, the photocatalytic property of the undoped Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NR samples has been studied under
visible light, where the evolution of hydrogen was measured according
to the photocatalytic water-splitting process, as shown in Figure 6a. The results show
that Fe2O3 NRs have almost no photocatalytic
hydrogen evolution activity, while the Sn-FeOOH NRs have a rate of
2.3 μmol h–1, which was never reported. As
the conduction band potential of Fe2O3 lies
below the H2 evolution potential, it is not high enough
to drive water reduction without bias.16 As the conduction band potential of FeO (−4.33 V vs vacuum)
is above the potential of H+/H2 (−4.44
V vs vacuum), the hydrogen evolution activity can be observed in the
presence of large amounts of FeO in the Sn-FeOOH NRs.

Mechanism
Mott–Schottky (MS) plots were obtained
from the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurement for samples
Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH
NRs, as shown in Figure S5. From MS curves,
the capacitance of the space charge region, formed at the semiconductor/electrolyte
interface, is measured to determine the active concentration of dopants.
The MS equation is described by 2  where k, ne, C,
and e are the Boltzmann constant, the hole carrier
density, the space charge capacitance in the semiconductor, and the
elemental charge value, respectively. ε and ε0 are the relative permittivity of the semiconductor (ε = 80
for hematite44 and 27 for Fe2O345) and the permittivity
of the vacuum, respectively. V and T are the applied potential and temperature, respectively. The slope
of the linear part of the curve in the Mott–Schottky plot is
positive from −0.3 to 0.4 V, indicating an n-type semiconductor
induced by oxygen vacancy, and the electron carrier density ne can be calculated from the following relation 3  From Figure S5b,c, the slope was obtained as 12.89
× 109, 39.77 ×
109, and 29.55 × 109 cm4/F2 for Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NRs, respectively. Then, the respective carrier concentrations
are estimated to be 1.37 × 1020, 1.31 × 1020, and 1.77 × 1020 cm–3.
Comparing the three samples, the Sn-FeOOH sample has larger carrier
density ne. The improved electrical conductivity
and unit cell volume with the increase in the doping concentration
of the phase pure powders might be related to the increased Fe2+ state.46

In PEC cell, as
an n-type semiconductor, electrons from the n-type Sn-FeOOH NRs reduce
water to form H2 and OH– ions, and a
positive center will be formed at the interfacial surface of the Sn-FeOOH
NRs, resulting in the formation of the built-in electric field, which
works in Schottky barrier mode. As the incident photon energy exceeds
the band gap energy of FeO (2.4 eV), electron–hole pairs will
be generated under visible-light radiation. The generated holes are
driven from the valence band of FeO into the interface of SnO2/electrolyte and captured by the reduced form of the redox
molecule (h+ + OH – → OH•), and the hydroxyl radicals OH• are then reduced
to OH– anions (e– + OH• → OH–) at the counter electrode. The photogenerated
electrons from the conduction band of FeO will transfer to the conduction
band of SnO2, which will retard the electron–hole
recombination. In this way, more photogenerated electrons from SnO2 can be collected by the FTO substrate and transferred to
the working electrode (Pt/FTO) by the external circuit. The circuit
was completed in this manner, demonstrating self-powered UV detection.

For sample Sn-Fe2O3, the SnO2 nanoparticles
are sparsely distributed on its surface, so the photogenerated electrons
from the valance band to the conduction band of FeO will quickly recombine
with the hole in the valence band where there are no SnO2 nanoparticles; this is consistent with the result of the shorter
transient decay time τ in Sn-Fe2O3 NRs.
For the Fe2O3 sample, as indicated in the XPS
spectra, the dominant content of Fe is Fe3+ with less content
of Fe2+. Due to the conduction band energy of Fe2O3 being lower than the H2 evolution potential,
water reduction could not occur without additional bias, and hence
the photocurrent is very low (as shown in Figure 5c).

Conclusions
FeOOH
nanorod arrays were prepared first by a modified hydrothermal
method, then annealed at 550 °C for 2 h with different steps,
finally, the Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NRs on FTO
substrates were obtained. In addition to the Fe3O2-FeO heterostructures in two samples, SnO2 particles with
a thickness of tens nm covered on the surface of Sn-FeOOH NRs. Due
to a large amount of Sn4+-doped ions in FeOOH NRs, more
and more Fe3+ ions reduced to Fe2+, resulting
in the dominant content of Fe ions being Fe2+ in Sn-FeOOH
samples. When the prepared samples were used as active photoanodes,
Sn-FeOOH NRs exhibit a much-enhanced photocurrent density of ∼40.7
μA cm–2 in the visible-light spectral region,
which is nearly 4-fold of 10.7 μA cm–2 for
Sn-Fe2O3 at 0.0 V versus Ag/AgCl. Using Hg/HgO
electrode as a reference electrode, Sn-FeOOH NRs have a photocurrent
of 0.2 mA cm–2 at 1.23 V vs RHE, quite larger than
that of Sn-Fe2O3 NRs. Furthermore, the sample
has a better photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity with a rate
of 2.3 μmol h–1.

In comparison with
the high-temperature reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ by using H2 or CO gases,47 here the FeO-based hierarchal structure was
obtained by doping Sn4+ ions to reduce Fe3+ ions
to Fe2+. Although some studies on hydrogen production by
using FeO have been reported, those works are mainly concentrated
on high-temperature solar chemistry with a temperature up to 750 °C,48 there are few reports on the photocatalytic
hydrogen. Our studies open a new routine to the preparation and to
the photocatalytic application of the wüstite (FeO) nanostructures.

Experimental
Section
Materials
All chemicals were of analytical grade and
used without further purification. Iron (III) chloride hexahydrate
(FeCl3·6H2O), tin dichloride dehydrate
(SnCl2·2H2O), acetone, ethanol, and hydrochloric
acid (HCl, 36.5–38% by weight) were purchased from Sinopharm
Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd. Fluorine-doped tin oxide (SnO2:F, FTO) conducting glass was provided by Hefei Kejing Material Technology
Co., Ltd.

Preparation of Fe2O3 NR Array
FeOOH NR arrays were prepared on the FTO substrate by a modified
hydrothermal method. The FTO glass substrate (1 × 2 cm2) cleaned with acetone and ethanol and subsequently rinsed with deionized
(DI) water was placed with the conducting side facing down in a Teflon-lined
autoclave. FeOOH NRs were grown in 20 mL of an aqueous solution containing
0.15 M FeCl3 and 40 μL of HCl at 100 °C for
6 h. After FeOOH NRs on FTO were thoroughly washed with DI water to
remove the salty residue, it was annealed at 550 °C for 2 h to
prepare Fe2O3 NRs on the FTO substrate.

Synthesis
of Sn-Doped Fe2O3 NRs Array
Tin dichloride
dehydrate (SnCl2·2H2O,
0.05 mol) was dissolved in 100 mL of ethanol. The solution was then
transferred into a conical flask, sealed, and stirred at 70 °C
for 4 h. To synthesize two types of Sn-doped Fe2O3 NR arrays, FTO glass substrates coated with FeOOH and Fe2O3 NR arrays were immersed in the Sn-precursor for 24
h at room temperature. The immersed FTO glass substrates were finally
sintered at 550 °C for 2 h in a muffle furnace under atmosphere.
Two types of Sn-doped Fe2O3 NR arrays were obtained,
labeled as samples Sn-Fe2O3 and Sn-FeOOH NRs,
respectively.

Characterization
The crystal structure
of the samples
was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction (XRD, Bruker D8 advance)
using Cu Kα (λ = 1.5406 Å) radiation. The morphology
information of Fe2O3, Sn-Fe2O3, and Sn-FeOOH NRs on the FTO substrate was acquired by a
field emission scanning electron microscope (SEM, S-4800, Hitachi).
High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images and
element mapping were acquired from a Tecanai G2 F30 microscope. UV–vis
absorption spectra (200–1200 nm) were measured using a Varian
Cary 50 UV–vis spectrophotometer. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) was conducted on an ESCALAB-250Xi photoelectron spectroscope
to obtain information on the valence state of the Fe, Sn, and O ions.

PEC Measurements
The electrochemical characteristics
of as-synthesized samples were evaluated by photocurrent density curves,
cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS),
and Mott–Schottky plots in the Zanner CIMPS electrochemical
workstation (Germany) using a three-electrode cell in 1 M KOH (pH
13.6) solution. A Pt wire and a Ag/AgCl (Hg/HgO) in saturated KCl
(KOH) were used as counter electrode and reference electrode, respectively,
and a 300 W Xe lamp (CEL-HXF 300, Beijing Au-light, China) was employed
as the incident light source to study the PEC response of the samples.
The H2 evolution experiments were carried out in a gas-closed
circulation system under a 100 W Xe lamp. In a typical reaction, the
catalyst film (1 × 1 cm2) was immersed in a C6H15NO3 aqueous solution (80 mL of distilled
water + 22.5 g of C6H15NO3) in Pyrex
cell with a side window.
