The
oxygen uptake of a series of Pr–CeO2 materials
was measured using thermogravimetric analysis at 420 and 600 °C,
and at both temperatures, 20% Pr–CeO2 was found
to have the highest uptake. The materials were characterized using
X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy. Defects
in the materials were identified using Raman spectroscopy, and ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy was used to show the presence of Pr cations in the +3
oxidation state. The existence of these species was attributed to
be responsible for the ability of the materials to uptake oxygen.
Electron energy loss spectroscopy was used to investigate the effect
of Pr addition to CeO2; the Ce M5/M4 and O IB/IC ratios were calculated to indicate the relative changes in the Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy concentration, respectively. There was no observable increase in the Ce3+ concentration;
however, the oxygen vacancy concentration increased with an increase
in the Pr content. Thus, Pr increases the defect concentration and
the ability of the materials to uptake oxygen.

Introduction
From both an environmental
and industrial perspective, the need
to develop low-cost oxygen generation technologies is ever-increasing.
High-purity (>99%) oxygen is currently generated cryogenically,
which
requires high energy consumptions, typically of ∼200–220
kW h per tonne of O2 produced.1 The energy associated with the air separation unit (ASU) of the
plants contributes to the increasing “carbon debt” of
the world. Approximately 35% of greenhouse gas emissions arise from
energy supply because of the combination of large energy penalties
in production and low efficiencies for conversion, transmission, and
distribution.2 Although research has focused
on reducing the energy and the associated cost of ASU through the
modification of existing systems, sorbent- and membrane-based alternatives
have also been proposed as methods of energy reduction.

Applications
of CeO2-based materials as solid oxide
fuel cells, catalysts, oxygen sensors, and oxygen separation membranes
are driven by the requirements for materials to exhibit both high
and reversible oxygen storage capacities (OSC), good electronic and
ionic conductivity, and chemical stability and consist of relatively
inexpensive components. CeO2 can reversibly uptake oxygen
because of a change in the Ce valence state under redox conditions.
Under low partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) conditions, Ce4+ cations are reduced and oxygen is removed
from the crystal lattice. Conversely, by increasing pO2, oxygen migrates into the lattice and Ce3+ cations are oxidized. When +3 cations are present, ionic conductivity
arises as oxygen ions move toward oxygen vacancies, and electronic
conductivity arises from the electron movement by a polaron hopping
mechanism.3 Polaron hopping exhibits a
temperature-dependence, in which at higher temperatures electrons
are able to move by hopping from Ce3+ to Ce4+.4 In the work by Su et al.,5 charge transfer on a CeO2(111) surface
with defects was found to occur by polaron migration followed by oxygen
diffusion.

The rare-earth cations, Tb and Pr, have been used
as dopants to
enhance the redox properties of CeO2. Higher oxygen uptakes
are achieved via the formation of extrinsic lattice defects or intrinsically
through the removal of oxygen anions from thermal treatment/reduction.6 The multivalent (+3/+4) nature of Pr and Tb can
further enhance the vacancy concentration of CeO2 and increase
both the electronic and ionic conductivities.7 The increased oxygen uptake of Pr–CeO2-based materials
can be attributed to the variable valence nature and high reducibility
of Pr; under a flow of He, Pr4+ can be reduced, whereas
Ce4+ requires a reducing gas such as H2. During
reduction, oxygen is removed from the lattice, generating vacancies
and +3 cations that are required to maintain the charge balance of
the lattice.8 At 700 °C, pO2 of >10–7 atm was found to be required
for the oxidation of Pr3+ in Ce0.8Pr0.2O2−δ.9 The pO2 required for the oxidation of Ce3+ to Ce4+ at room temperature is 10–30 atm.10 High reducibility of the Pr-based
materials can also be achieved at temperatures <250 °C.11 The lower reduction temperature can be attributed
to the lower cation reduction energy; 1.83 eV was required to reduce
two Pr4+ cations, however, 4.38 eV was needed for the reduction
of two Ce4+ cations.12 With
the addition of Pr, the reduction energy of CeO2 decreases
twice that of the Pr ionization energy.13,14 The nonstoichiometry
of Pr–Ce oxides varies the reduction enthalpy,15 and for Ce0.3Pr0.7O2−δ, it has been reported to be 2.9 ± 0.3 eV via Coulometric titration.16 Chatzichristodoulou and Hendriksen17 found that the oxygen nonstoichiometry of Ce0.8Pr0.2O2−δ could be modeled
using an excess enthalpic term (ΔHPrexc) linear in δ (oxygen nonstoichiometry) and defects
could be randomly distributed through the lattice. In their work,
the reduction behavior of Pr could be described using a δ-linear
(nonideal) defect model by estimating the oxidation partial molar
enthalpy and entropy. Overall, Pr–CeO2-mixed oxides
have a lower reduction temperature than pure CeO2 and have
a greater oxygen storage and release capacity.18 Thus, Pr–CeO2-mixed oxides have been
proposed to have applications as oxygen separation materials.

Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) allows for nanometer-length-scale
resolution and has been used for the investigation of Pr–CeO2 materials. Niu et al.19 reported
a decrease in the antibonding Ce peak intensity from the introduction
of Pr, evidencing an increase in the Ce3+ fraction and
an increase in the Ce IM5/IM4 ratio with increased % Pr. In
their work, the Ce IM5/IM4 ratio of CeO2 was 0.78,
10% Pr–CeO2 was 0.82, and 60% Pr–CeO2 was 1.17. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)–EELS
was used by Rodríguez-Luque et al.20 to demonstrate the segregation of Pr cations on the surface of CeO2 particles. Investigations were focused on the Ce edge because
of the reducible nature of Pr, which showed the Ce oxidation state
varied throughout the particle and that Ce3+ was primarily
located on the surface. In situ transition electron microscopy (TEM)
studies of the reduction process of Rh/Ce0.8Pr0.2O2 catalysts heated under H2 to 950 °C
show that the Ce and Pr edges undergo a 1.4 eV shift to lower energy,
the Ce antibonding peak intensities decrease and, for the Pr edge,
a peak appears on the lower energy side of the M4 peak.21 Furthermore, evidence of oxygen vacancy ordering
was first observed at 700 °C, although the reduction of Pr4+ occurs below this temperature. The segregation of Gd in
CeO2-based electrolytes has also been evidenced from the
integrated intensity ratio of the Gd N5,4 and Ce N5,4 edges and increased Pr, Gd, and Ce3+ concentrations
from the respective Pr M5,4, Gd M5,4, and Ce
M5,4 edges.22 Ultrahigh-energy-resolution
valence-loss EELS has been used by Bowman et al.23 to measure the band gap states in Pr0.1Ce0.9O2−δ.

In a similar Tb–CeO2 system, we have recently
reported the qualitative trends between the Ce3+ and the
oxygen vacancy concentration, % Tb, and oxygen uptake for a series
of Tb–CeO2 materials.24 This work showed that by increasing the % Tb the oxygen vacancy
concentration and the oxygen uptake increased. However, it was also
found that there was no observable change in the Ce3+ concentration.
Here, we have extended this work to report the effect of % Pr on the
oxygen uptake, Ce3+, and the oxygen vacancy concentration
of CeO2. To our knowledge, this is the first fundamental
study identifying and detailing the correlations between the Pr, defect
(oxygen vacancy), and Ce3+ concentrations with oxygen uptake.
Oxygen uptakes were determined in gas-switching experiments using
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The materials were characterized
using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and STEM. Diffuse reflectance ultraviolet–visible
(DR UV–vis) spectroscopy was used to determine the presence
of Pr3+ cations in CeO2, which are responsible
for oxygen uptake, and Raman spectroscopy was used to determine the
existence of vacancy defects. Using EELS, the qualitative relationships
between the oxygen uptake and the Ce3+ and oxygen vacancy
concentration were established.

Experimental Section
Material
Preparation
The Pr–CeO2-mixed
oxides (Pr = 10, 15, and 20 mol %) were prepared by coprecipitation
from (NH4)2Ce(NO3)6 (Aldrich,
>98.5%), Pr(NO3)·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.9%),
and urea (15× the total ion concentration, Sigma-Aldrich, 99–100.5%),
which were dissolved in water and heated at 90 °C for 8 h. PrO2−δ was prepared using the same conditions with
Pr(NO3)·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.9%) and urea.
The resultant precipitates were filtered, washed with water and ethanol,
and dried overnight in an oven at 100 °C. The materials were
heated under a nitrogen atmosphere to 700 °C for 2 h with a heating
rate of 2 °C min–1.

X-Ray Diffraction
XRD patterns were collected on a
Bruker D8 Focus diffractometer equipped with a monochromatic Cu Kα
(λ = 1.5406 Å) source operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The
data were collected over a 2θ range of 5–80, with a step
size of 0.02° and a step time of 1° min–1.

Thermogravimetric Analysis
To quantify oxygen uptake,
gas-switching experiments were carried out using a Mettler Toledo
TGA/DSC 1 system. The samples were weighed (∼10 mg) into an
alumina crucible (150 μL) and heated to 420 and 600 °C
in a flow of nitrogen (35 mL·min–1) before
instrument air was introduced (35 mL·min–1),
after which nitrogen was then reintroduced. The flow of air was mixed
with a N2 carrier gas that resulted in a pO2 of 13.3 kPa delivered to the sample. When the gas was
switched to instrument air the weight increase was used to calculate
the oxygen uptake. To ensure data consistency,
averages were obtained from a minimum of two separate experiments
with a maximum of three standard errors of the mean.

Raman Spectroscopy
The spectra were obtained using
a Renishaw inVia Raman spectrograph with an excitation wavelength
of 632.8 nm from a HeNe source. The spectra were obtained between
2000 and 200 nm, with a spot size of ∼1 μm and a laser
power of 1 mW on the sample.

DR UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The
presence of Pr3+ was identified using a Cary 5000 spectrometer
fitted with
a DR accessory. The spectra were obtained with a 1 nm data interval
between 800 and 200 nm in % reflectance mode with polytetrafluoroethylene
as the reference followed by applying the Kubelka–Munk equation.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
STEM bright-field
(BF) and high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) images were obtained
at 200 kV on an FEI Tecnai G2 F20 S-TWIN FEGTEM instrument. All samples
were prepared by dispersing into butanol and ultrasonicating before
dipping an ultrathin holey carbon film into the solution.

EELS
measurements were recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100F FEGTEM and Gatan
776 Enfina 1000 parallel detection EELS spectrometer by the method
described in D’Angelo et al.24 The
spectra were obtained in diffraction mode using a condenser aperture
of 40 μm, a spot size of 1 μm, a dispersion of 0.1 eV/channel,
and a collection aperture of 3 mm. Approximately 10 spectra were
acquired from different clusters located on the grid with individual
crystallites in random orientation. The data were obtained using an
acquisition time of 5 s and by summing 20 spectra. These conditions
allowed for beam damage to be minimized25 and compositional variations20 and orientation
dependence variation to be eliminated.26 The background was subtracted using the power-law technique, and
the integrated white-line intensities were determined using a 16 eV
window for Ce M5,4 and a 2 eV window for the O IB/IC edge.27

Results and Discussion
Structural and Morphology
Characterization
The diffraction
patterns of the Pr–CeO2 materials are presented
in Figure 1 and show
that all reflections can be indexed to the cubic fluorite structure
(space group Fm3̅m) of CeO2 (JCPDS card 00-034-0394).28 Pr–CeO2-mixed oxides with >20% Pr exhibited phase segregation,
as
shown in Figure S1; hence, these were not
used further in this study.

Pr = 10, 15, and 20% with the reflections from the cubic fluorite
structure labeled.

STEM BF and HAADF images
(Figure 2a–c)
showed that the materials comprised aggregated
crystallites ∼<10 nm. A d-spacing of 0.31
nm can be seen for 20% Pr–CeO2 in Figure 2c, which corresponds to the
(111) plane of the CeO2 cubic fluorite lattice. The images
of the synthesized pure PrO2−δ show that the
particles were aggregated and had an elongated octahedral-type morphology
(Figure 2d). Further
images of the materials are presented in Figure S2.

Measurement of Oxygen Uptake
Using TGA
The oxygen uptake
of Pr–CeO2 was measured in gas-switching experiments
using TGA, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The oxygen uptake increased by increasing
the % Pr and the analysis temperature. At 420 °C, the uptakes
for Pr = 10, 15, and 20% were 24, 31, and 41 μmol·g–1, respectively. In this work, the temperature (420
°C) required for the uptake was comparable with the temperatures
used by Mullhaupt29 for Ce–Pr materials
(380–606 °C). Oxygen uptake is considered to be primarily
due to the reduction of Pr, in contrast to the reduction of Ce. This
is because lower pO2 (<10–30 atm at room temperature) and higher temperatures (>2000 K at
ambient
pressure) are required to remove oxygen from CeO2.10 Oxygen desorption from PrO2 thin
films occurs over the range 377–517 °C as a result of
a PrO2 → Pr5O9 transition.30 Similarly, the temperature-programmed reduction
of Pr6O11 under H2 showed a main
peak at 517 °C, assigned to the maximum amount of bulk oxygen
loss.31 Oxygen vacancies are generated
in the crystal structure from the addition of Pr, which increases
the ability of the materials to lose oxygen.

Figure 3 Oxygen uptake of the
Pr–CeO2 oxides at 420 and
600 °C as determined using TGA. CeO2 had an uptake
of <5 μmol·g–1.

Increasing the analysis temperature from 420 to 600 °C
resulted
in overall increase in the uptake at each % Pr. The uptakes when Pr
= 10, 15, and 20% were 33, 55, and 95 μmol·g–1, respectively. These values are significantly higher than the measured
uptake of <5 μmol·g–1 for CeO2. Higher uptakes were measured at 600 °C in comparison
with those at 420 °C as the materials lose more oxygen when heated,
and hence, the extent of reduction is greater. When heating PrO2−δ under a flow of N2, a loss of 0.5%
at 420 °C and 1.2% at 600 °C is observed and attributed
to the loss of oxygen (Figure S3).8 However, it is considered that weight loss due
to the removal of water vapor also contributes to the measured weight
loss. Overall, Pr was found to promote the oxygen uptake of CeO2 at both 420 and 600 °C.

Analysis of Defects Using
Raman and DR UV–Vis Spectroscopy
The presence of defects
in the Pr-doped CeO2 materials
was determined through Raman spectroscopy and DR UV–vis spectroscopy.
A 633 nm Raman excitation laser was selected to increase the laser
penetration depth and provide bulk and surface information by minimizing
optical absorption. Figure 4a shows the presence of an F2g band at 460 cm–1 due to a CeO8-type complex with Oh symmetry and a wide defect
band at 500–650 cm–1. As suggested by Li
et al.,32 because of the similar ionic
radii of the +3 and +4 Ce and Pr cations, the presence of this defect
band is likely from the differences in oxidation states rather than
differences in ionic radii. The defect band has been reported to consist
of two modes at 560 and 584 cm–1 from metal–O
complexes both with and without vacancies.33 Through peak-fitting of the Pr = 20% material spectra using a Lorentzian
function, these two species are suggested to be present in the synthesized
Pr-doped CeO2 materials. Defects are introduced into the
crystal structure when Pr is added to CeO2 as this defect
mode is not present for CeO2. For every two +3 cations,
one oxygen vacancy is needed to maintain the charge balance of the
lattice.

Figure 4 (a) Raman spectra of CeO224 and Pr–CeO2 with Pr = 10, 15, and 20% showing
the defect band characteristic of vacancies. (b) DR UV–vis
spectra of CeO2 and Pr–CeO2 with Pr =
10, 15, and 20%.

It can also be observed
that the F2g band exhibits a
downward shift with increasing % Pr. A shift in the F2g mode of the rare-earth-oxide-doped CeO2 materials has
been attributed to the lattice contraction and/or the introduction
of vacancies.34 Lattice contraction may
occur by increasing the % Pr as Pr4+ (Pr4+ =
0.96 Å) cations are smaller (but only slightly) than those of
Ce (Ce4+ = 0.97 Å).35 Lee
et al.36 attributed the downward shift
in the F2g band of CeO2 nanorods to volume expansion
from the generation of vacancies; the larger the shift, the higher
the expected oxygen vacancy concentration. It is
predicted that when Pr cations are incorporated into the CeO2 lattice there is a mixture of Pr in both the +3 and +4 oxidation
states. These findings correspond to the understanding that pure PrO2−δ possesses cations in both the +3 and +4 oxidation
states.37 As the amount of added Pr increases,
the concentration of cations in both the +4 and +3 oxidation states
is considered to increase. Although vacancies are present in these
materials as shown by the defect band at ∼500–650 cm–1, if the concentration of these cations is low, then
the lattice may still contract from the increasing amount of Pr4+ and result in the F2g mode shift. Ahn et al.12 reported for a series of Pr-doped CeO2 using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, that Pr3+ was present as the majority ion and Pr4+ as the
minority ion. The concentration of vacancies and +3 cations is likely
not great enough to result in an observable expansion of the lattice
cell.

DR UV–vis spectra of CeO2 and the Pr–CeO2 materials are presented in Figure 4b. In all spectra, the peak present at ∼250
nm corresponds to Ce3+ from a O2– →
Ce3+ charge transfer, the peak at ∼280 nm corresponds
to a O2– → Ce4+ charge transfer,
and the peak at ∼330 nm corresponds to an interband transition
from the O 2p to Ce 4f band.38 In addition,
a strong absorption is observed between 400 and 650 nm for the Pr–CeO2 materials because of Pr3+ transitions. In the
work by Kasprowicz et al.39 on Pr-doped
Bi2ZnOB2O6, Pr3+ absorption
bands between 430 and 490 nm were attributed to 3H4 ground state to 3PJ transitions and those between 560 and 610 nm from 3H4 to 1D2 transitions. Also, in the work
by Strzęp et al.,40 a prominent
488 nm 4f–4f band was assigned to 3H4 transitions to 3P0 multiplets. It has been
reported that Pr4+ does not absorb in the UV–vis
region.41,42 Overall, our results show that the Pr–CeO2 materials contain Pr cations in the +3 oxidation state and
oxygen defects/vacancies.

Transition Electron Microscopy–Electron
Energy Loss Spectroscopy
TEM–EELS was used qualitatively
to investigate the relative
changes in Ce3+ and oxygen concentration of the Pr–CeO2 materials. The background-subtracted Ce M5,4 EELS
spectra of CeO2 and the Pr–CeO2 materials
are presented in Figure 5a and show the presence of two Ce white lines at 883 and 901 eV due
to 3d5/2 → 4f7/2 (M5) and
3d3/2 → 4f5/2 (M4) electron
transitions, respectively. When Pr is introduced, two Pr M5,4 white lines can be observed at 951 and 931 eV that are from 3d to
4f transitions and are characteristic of all lanthanides. The intensity
of these peaks increases as the Pr content increases. On the higher
energy side of each white line labeled also exists a satellite peak.43

Figure 5 (a) Ce M5,4 white lines of CeO2 and
Pr–CeO2 with % Pr = 10, 15, and 20 and (b) M5 and M4 white lines of PrO2−δ.

The ratio between IM5 and IM4 indicates the f-shell occupancy,
where an increase in the number of f-shell electrons results in an
increase in the IM5/IM4 ratio.44 For pure CeO2, the intensity of IM5 is less than that of IM4 and all cations are in the +4 oxidation state (Ce4+ = 4f0). It is expected that the concentration
of Ce3+ is minimal in CeO2 because of the low pO2 required to reduce Ce4+. As the
amount of +3 cations increases, that is, electrons in the initial
level increase (Ce3+ = 4f1) and there is a decrease
in IM4. For PrO2−δ, as under standard conditions the oxide is nonstoichiometric and
consists of cations in both the +3(4f2) and +4(4f1) states, IM5 > IM4.45 In Figure 5b, the smaller peaks
labeled “A” and “C” on the high-energy
side of the M5/M4 lines can be observed for
PrO2−δ and are due to Pr4+. A shoulder
peak on the lower energy side of M4, labeled B, from Pr3+ is also visible. Here, it is indicated that the cations
in PrO2−δ exist in both the +3 and +4 oxidation
states. The two Pr white lines are evident in all of the Pr–CeO2 materials and show that Pr cations are within the lattice.
The Pr ratio for all materials is IM5 > IM4, indicating
that
a significant portion of the cations is in the +3 oxidation state.

The Ce IM5/IM4 white-line ratio was calculated for the
integrated intensities, and the results are presented in Figure 6 and Table S1. The Ce IM5/IM4 ratio for
CeO2 was 0.68 and that for Pr = 10, 15, and 20% was 0.69,
0.68, and 0.69, respectively. Differences between the Ce4+/Ce3+ concentrations in these materials are not evident.
In our previous work, the Ce IM5/IM4 ratio for CeO2 synthesized from a Ce(NO3)3·6H2O cerium salt was 0.67 ± 0.01. This result is comparable with
the ratio measured in this work for CeO2, although a different
cerium salt was used. A difference in the M5/M4 area ratio of 0.01 can correspond to a 9% increase in the amount
of Ce3+.25 It has been reported
that using the X-ray absorption near-edge structure, the oxidation
state of the Ce cations in Pr–CeO2 solid solutions
does not vary from that of the initial CeO2 (+4).19 Furthermore, there is no observable decrease
in the Ce and Pr satellite peak intensity as the amount of % Pr increases.
Consequently, we interpret the Ce +4/+3 concentration to not vary
or at least not significantly or detectably using this method. At
higher % Pr, the intensity of the antibonding transitions has been
found to decrease for Ce0.9Pr0.1O2 thin films on Si(111) as the amount of Ce3+ in the materials
increases.19 As there is no variation in
the Ce ratios of the synthesized and Pr–CeO2 materials
or in the intensity of the Ce satellite peaks, the increase in the
spectral changes are considered to be due to the introduction of Pr.

Figure 6 Average
Ce IM5/IM4 and O IB/IC intensity ratios for CeO2 and Pr–CeO2 with % Pr = 10, 15, and 20.

The O K (1s) near-edge fine structure spectra of the Pr–CeO2 materials are presented in Figure 7. The CeO2 ground state has a
filled oxygen 2p valence band and, because of the strong hybridization
between Ce levels and O 2p orbitals, the electronic structure has
been reported to be a mixture of 4f0 and 4f1–O 2p states.43,46,47 Because of dipole selection rules, only an s → p transition
is permitted; however, this mixing allows for electric dipole transitions
from the O 1s orbital to the p-like component of the Ce 4f and 5d
states.48 Similarly, when Pr is added,
the mixing of O 2p and Pr 4f states also allows for these transitions.49,50 The peak labeled “A” arises from O 1s → Ce
4f transitions, and peaks “B” and “C”
arise from O 1s → Ce 5d–eg and 5d–t2g levels in the conduction band, respectively.51 An increase in the ratio between the peaks labeled
B and C has been reported as indicative of the presence of vacancies
or defect sites within the crystal lattice. The O IB/IC ratio for CeO2 was 0.68 and that for Pr = 10, 15, and 20% was 0.70, 0.74, and 0.76,
respectively. The higher O IB/IC ratio for the Pr–CeO2 materials,
compared to CeO2, shows that the vacancies are generated
by the addition of Pr. The vacancies that are generated have been
reported to primarily exist around Pr ions rather than Ce.12 Pr–CeO2 has a vacancy formation
energy of ∼1/3 of CeO2, which results from both
structural and electronic modifications of the lattice.52 Also, our results reveal that the O IB/IC ratio gradually
increases with increasing % Pr. This increase was attributed to an
increase in the vacancy concentration, which is likely responsible
for the observed trend in oxygen uptakes as the % Pr increases.

Figure 7 O K (1s) near-edge
fine structure of CeO2 and Pr–CeO2 with
% Pr = 10, 15, and 20.

Visual inspection of the O K (1s) fine structure shows that
the
peaks of the 20% Pr–CeO2 are slightly less defined
and broader in comparison to those of CeO2. In ZnO nanocrystals,
Zn L3 broadening and a weakened fine structure have been
reported to be due to an increase in the vacancy concentration.53 Furthermore, the intensity of the peak labeled
A appears to decrease relative to the peak labeled B with increasing
% Pr. A decrease in the O IA/IC ratio for the Pr–CeO2 materials compared
to CeO2 may be attributed to an increase in +3 cations
filling the 4f state and inhibiting transitions. For CeO2-based materials consisting of only +3 cations, this peak is not
present as the 4f orbital is occupied (4f1).48 The structure can also be modified to result
in the degradation of O 2p–Ce 4f hybridization and a decrease
in the intensity of A.54 Distortion of
the crystal lattice occurs as the introduction of Pr4+/Pr3+ cations weakens the metal–oxygen bonds, lowering
the reduction temperature and ease at which oxygen can be removed.
The local structure near the vacancy is distorted as the lattice accommodates
the larger Pr3+ cations that are generated during reduction.12 As the material is reduced and +3 cations/vacancies
are generated, the resulting structural distortions can result in
the broadening of the observed peak.25 An
increase in vacancies and broadened O-extended fine structure have
also been observed for vacancy concentrations of ∼4%.55

The results presented here support those
obtained using Raman spectroscopy
that show the structure is modified through the addition of Pr from
the presence of oxygen vacancy defects. The introduction of vacancies
is also likely responsible for the exhibited oxygen uptake, where
the higher the vacancy concentration, the higher the oxygen uptake.

Conclusions
In this work, the presence of vacancy defects
in a series of Pr–CeO2-mixed oxides was determined
to provide further insight into
the oxygen uptake ability of CeO2-based materials. Correlations
between the quantities of Pr added and the oxygen uptake, Ce3+, and oxygen vacancy concentration of CeO2 were established.
The materials were synthesized with Pr = 10, 15, and 20%, and the
oxygen uptakes were determined as a function of % Pr and at 420 and
600 °C. The highest uptake of 95 μmol·g–1 was achieved for 20% Pr at 600 °C and is higher than <5
μmol·g–1 obtained for CeO2. By increasing the analysis temperature, a greater portion of cations
undergoes reduction to the +3 oxidation state, which, in turn, generates
oxygen vacancies. The higher portion of defects acts as oxygen absorption
sites to result in the increase in oxygen uptake with an increase
in temperature and % Pr.

Vacancies were evident in the materials
after the addition of Pr
through Raman spectroscopy, as a broad defect band at 500–650
cm–1 was attributed to the combination of two modes
because of oxygen vacancy defects and MO8 complexes containing
a Pr cation without vacancy. A downward shift in the F2g mode was also attributed to the increasing quantity of oxygen vacancies,
and DR UV–vis spectroscopy showed the presence of Pr3+. To maintain the charge balance of the lattice, cations in the +3
oxidation state are required to accompany the oxygen vacancies.

EELS was used to qualitatively investigate the relative changes
in Ce3+ and oxygen concentration through the calculation
of the Ce IM5/IM4 and O IB/IC ratios, respectively. The spectra of pure
PrO2−δ show both smaller peaks on the high-energy
side because of Pr4+ and a shoulder peak on the lower energy
side of M4 from Pr3+, implying the oxide has
mixed valence. By increasing the Pr content, there was no observable
increase in the Ce3+ concentration. The oxygen vacancy
concentration was found to increase when Pr was added to CeO2, which further increased with increasing Pr content. Thus, it was
concluded that the observed oxygen uptakes of Pr–CeO2 were due to the presence of oxygen vacancies from the addition of
Pr. These results emphasize the defect nature of Pr–CeO2 and may be used to develop materials requiring high oxygen
uptakes.
