Brassica oleracea crops are exposed
to seasonal changes in temperature because of their biennial life
cycle. Extreme temperatures (cold and heat) affect the photosynthetic
activity and the yield of cabbage (B. oleracea capitata group) and kale (B. oleracea acephala group). We studied the relationship among antioxidant defenses,
photosynthesis, and yield under extreme temperatures in both crops.
Under these conditions, the plants increase the antioxidant defenses,
responding to an increment in reactive oxygen species (ROS). The accumulation
of ROS in chloroplasts decreases the chlorophyll content and provokes
photoinhibition that leads to a low fixation of CO2 and
loss of dry weight. Low temperatures especially increase the antioxidant
defenses and decrease the chlorophyll content compared to the heat
conditions. However, dry weight losses are higher when plants are
grown under heat than under cold conditions, probably because of the
inactivation of Rubisco and/or the associated enzymes. Both crops
were more resilient to cold than to heat temperatures, the capitata
group being more resistant.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Environmental changes cause metabolic responses in plants focused
on maintaining homeostasis inside cells. When the equilibrium between
energy generation and consumption to maintain plant defenses is broken,
the growth and development of plants can be compromised leading even
to death after a long-term exposure.1 Among
the environmental stresses, high and low temperatures can have devastating
effects on plants, leading to important economic losses in the field
of agriculture.

Brassica oleracea crops such as
broccoli, kale, cauliflower, cabbage, and so forth are cultivated
worldwide, making the species the most outstanding from an economical
point of view.2 During their vegetative
cycle, biennial species, such as B. oleracea, are exposed to summer temperatures that can reach more than 40
°C and also to winter temperatures that can drop below 0 °C.
The physiological and morphological responses of the two cultivars
of B. oleracea, cabbage (capitata group)
and kale (acephala group), subjected to extreme temperatures, were
studied by Rodríguez et al.2 Extreme
temperatures affected the photosynthetic activity and yield of both
crops. One of the possible causes of these adverse effects is the
oxidative stress.

When the environmental temperature overpasses
the physiological
threshold of a plant, the concentration of reactive oxygen species
(ROS) can increase inside the cells.3 ROS
are currently produced in plants, and they are needed for cellular
signaling; however, under stress conditions and when the antioxidant
defenses are overcome, their concentration can increase to harmful
levels producing oxidative stress. They can seriously disrupt the
normal metabolism of plants through the oxidation of membrane lipids,
proteins, and nucleic acids,4 thus fatally
affecting the plant metabolism and limiting the growth and yield.5 The coordinated action of the antioxidant defenses
is necessary to protect the plants against the high concentration
of ROS.1

Different enzymes and metabolites
participate in the antioxidant
defense system. Ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase,
and peroxiredoxins are the antioxidant enzymes which participate in
protecting the cells against an excess of ROS.4 Glutathione is a metabolite which protects the photosynthetic apparatus.6 The principal function of glutathione is to maintain
the intracellular redox balance, detoxifying ROS, xenobiotics, and
heavy metals.5,7 Phenolic compounds are able to
scavenge ROS capacity,8 neutralizing singlet
and triplet oxygen, or decomposing peroxides.9

Understanding the bases of tolerance to temperature stress
would
help in designing the strategies for sustainable crop yield under
these environmental conditions. In this paper, we study the relationship
of the antioxidant defenses of kale and cabbage subjected to temperature
stress to several physiological parameters and leaf yield.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Thermal Stress Increases
Antioxidant Defenses
Significant changes occur in antioxidant
defenses in plants subjected
to environmental stresses, including enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants.
The association of the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GR) and
several others enables to keep the oxidative damages on the plant
intracellular components to a very low level.7 For this reason, we measured the activity of the three antioxidant
enzymes (SOD, CAT, and GR) under two conditions of thermal stress
(12 and 32 °C) and under the optimal temperature (20 °C).
Cold and heat produced a significant increase of enzymatic activities
compared to the values observed under the control temperature, confirming
that the plants under stressful conditions undergo oxidative stress
(Figure 1). The most
active enzymes in response to environmental stressful conditions are
CAT and SOD.10 SOD is usually considered
as the first line of defense against oxidative stress.11 This enzyme catalyzes the partitioning of O2– into either an ordinary molecular O2 or into H2O2, which is also damaging,
but less so, and is degraded by other enzymes such as APX or CAT.
Although both enzymes degrade H2O2, the role
of CAT is mainly focused in neutralizing the excess of ROS during
stressful conditions, whereas APX is more involved in the fine modulation
of ROS for signaling.4 CAT neutralizes
H2O2 by transforming it into H2O
and O2. SOD and CAT are important antioxidant defense systems
in nearly all living cells exposed to oxygen. Another important antioxidant
enzyme is GR. GR catalyzes the reduction of glutathione disulfide
(GSSG) to reduced glutathione (GSH), which plays a significant role
in maintaining the GSH level and redox state and protecting the cells
against ROS.12

Figure 1 Activities of (A) CAT,
(B) SOD, and (C) GR enzymes in the seedlings
of B. oleracea var. acephala and B. oleracea var. capitata grown under three temperatures:
12, 20, and 32 °C. The significant differences among temperatures
(p ≤ 0.05) are indicated by different letters.
The significant differences between the crops at a given temperature
are indicated by an asterisk (p ≤ 0.05).

In general terms, the activity
of these enzymes was significantly
higher under cold than under control conditions (Figure 1). An increment in the CAT
and SOD activities compared to the control temperatures was also observed
in different species of the Brassica genus subjected to cold conditions. The activity of these enzymes
has been associated to the resilience to low temperatures in canola
(Brassica napus L.) cultivars,10,13 especially in the cold-adapted ones.14 However, although we recently reported that cabbage showed a higher
stability under cold conditions than kale based on the physiological
parameters,2 we did not observe any differences
between the two crops under cold conditions for any of the three enzymatic
activities measured.

The enzymatic activity of CAT, SOD, and
GR was significantly higher
under heat than under control conditions (Figure 1) for both crops. The activity of these enzymes
has also been associated to the resilience to heat stress in Brassica species. The CAT activity was correlated
to the tolerance against heat stress in three genotypes of Indian
mustard which belong to Brassica juncea.5 Lin et al.4 found that the heat stress enhanced the enzymatic activity of CAT
in broccoli and Chinese cabbage; however, the SOD activity was not
affected. The CAT and GR activities under heat conditions were not
significantly different between acephala and capitata. However, SOD
was higher in the acephala variety compared to the capitata cultivar.

Cold and heat temperatures increased the antioxidant activity of
CAT, SOD, and GR, compared to control. On the contrary, Zhang et al.11 studied the responses of canola under contrasting
temperature regimes, 35/30 and 15/10 °C in comparison with the
optimal temperature (25/20 °C) at an early seedling stage. The
antioxidant enzymes responded to high and low temperatures differently.
Under high temperatures, the SOD activity was reduced, whereas the
CAT activity increased. Under low temperatures, however, the SOD activities
increased, whereas those of CAT remained unchanged.11

The antioxidant defenses neutralize ROS, keeping
their concentration
to nonharmful levels under environmental stress.1 The antioxidant defense system includes both enzymatic
and nonenzymatic components. Phenolic compounds and glutathione are
recognized as the important antioxidant metabolites.1 The phenolic compounds are considered to be mainly responsible
for antioxidant capacity in the Brassica crops. They have higher antioxidant activity in vitro than the vitamins
or carotenoids8 and can neutralize ROS
because of their structure, by donating electrons.15

The plants showed the highest phenolic content at
12 °C (Figure 2A). At 32 °C,
the capitata variety showed a higher phenolic content compared to
the control conditions, whereas the acephala variety did not show
significant differences. The content of phenolic compounds was lower
in the capitata variety compared to that in acephala at 12 and 20
°C (Figure 2A).
The content of soluble phenolic acids and anthocyanins increased in
winter oilseed rape leaves with cold treatment.16 Plants can accumulate phenolic compounds as a response
to temperature stress by regulating the anabolism and catabolism of
these metabolites.1 The antioxidant potential,
measured with the ABTS assay, was significantly higher at 12 °C
and at 32 °C compared to control for both crops. The acephala
variety had more antioxidant activity than the capitata one under
the three temperatures (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 (A) Total phenolic content, (B) antioxidant potential (ABTS), and
(C) glutathione content in the seedlings of B. oleracea var. acephala and B. oleracea var. capitata grown under three temperatures: 12, 20, and 32 °C. The significant
differences among temperatures (p ≤ 0.05)
are indicated by different letters. The significant differences between
the crops at a given temperature are indicated by an asterisk (p ≤ 0.05).

Glutathione is an antioxidant metabolite which is involved
in the
protection of the photosynthetic apparatus.6 A high glutathione content would protect the photosynthetic apparatus
against ROS generated by temperature stress. The glutathione content was not significantly different between
12 and 32 °C, but both temperatures significantly differed from
control (Figure 2C).
Phenolic compounds and antioxidant activity, which is associated to
this kind of compounds in Brassica crops,17 and glutathione increased under temperature
stress, indicating an increase in ROS. A significant increase in the
level of glutathione was observed in the seedlings of broccoli subjected
to cold conditions.10 The content of glutathione
increased significantly after heat stress in the seedlings of B. juncea.5

2.2 Antioxidant Defenses Are Related to Chlorophyll
Content and Leaf Weight
The total amount of chlorophyll (Chl)
was higher under control conditions, followed by heat and then cold
for both varieties (Figure 3A). The concentration of Chl a and Chl b suffers a reduction at 12 °C compared to control
in both crops (Figure 3B). Under heat conditions, the concentration of Chl b decreased with respect to control, but the concentration of Chl a was similar to that of the control (Figure 3B).

Figure 3 (A) Total Chl concentration and (B) Chl a and
Chl b concentrations in the seedlings of B. oleracea var. acephala and B. oleracea var. capitata grown under three temperatures: 12, 20,
and 32 °C. The significant differences among temperatures (p ≤ 0.05) are indicated by different letters. The
significant differences between the crops at a given temperature are
indicated by an asterisk (p ≤ 0.05).

The concentration of Chl b was higher than Chl a under 20 °C,
but this relationship was inverted when
the stress temperatures were considered (Figure 3B). Similarly, the Chl a/b ratio increased with higher temperature in canola.18 Chl a is the pigment that acts
in the light requiring reactions of photosynthesis. Chl b is an accessory
pigment and acts indirectly in photosynthesis by transferring the
light it absorbs to Chl a. An increase in the Chl a/b ratio under stress conditions may result
from the faster degradation of Chl b.19 The concentration of Chl b was
higher in capitata than in acephala at 12 and 32 °C.

To
study the relationship between the antioxidant parameters and
the content of Chl, the correlation analysis was performed. Generally
speaking, the concentration of the total Chl and Chl b were negatively and significantly correlated with the level of antioxidant
activities and the amount of antioxidant compounds (Table 1), whereas the Chl a content was significantly and negatively correlated only with the
CAT activity and the content of phenolic compounds. As mentioned before,
Chl b has a faster degradation than Chl a under stress conditions. The degradation may be due to the accumulation
of ROS in the chloroplast. Photosynthesis is a well-established source
of ROS in plants.6 The reaction centers
of PSI and PSII in the chloroplast thylakoids are the major sites
of ROS generation.20 One of the key factors
that influences the balance between the damage of the photosynthetic
machinery and the restoration of its activity is the relationship
between the strength of the oxidative stress and the activity of the
antioxidant system.21

In this case,
there is an increase in antioxidant defenses when
plants are grown under stressful conditions, coinciding with the decrement
in Chl b content, probably because of the accumulation
of ROS in the chloroplasts. The accumulation of ROS may also decrease
PSII activity and stimulate gene expression, particularly with regard
to the acclimation and defense genes.2,18 Rodriguez
et al.2 studied the physiological and morphological
changes of plants subjected to temperature stress in the same experiment.
The maximum quantum yield of primary photochemistry (φP0), equivalent to the Fv/Fm parameter,2 was used to monitor
the performance of PSII activity. This parameter was significantly
reduced under heat and cold compared to control conditions2 in both crops, suggesting that the stress temperatures
caused photoinhibition.

When photoinhibition takes place, the
accumulation of the reduced
electron acceptors may increase the generation of ROS, which can induce
oxidative injuries.19 These oxidative injuries
could enhance Chl b degradation or the inhibition
of its biosynthesis, damage PSII components, inactivate chloroplast
enzymes, especially those participating in CO2 assimilation,19 and could further explain the reductions in Fv/Fm and Chl content
in the temperature-stressed plants of this work.

The correlations
computed with the data obtained from the present
work (antioxidant defenses and content of Chl) and the leaf yield
(fresh and dry weight) obtained by Rodríguez et al.2 were computed. The fresh weight was positively
correlated to the Chl b content and negatively to
the different antioxidant systems (Table 1). However, the dry weight was not correlated
to the antioxidant defenses or the Chl content. Enhanced photosynthesis
does not always lead to increased yield in crops because of several
possible reasons, including the inhibition of the fixation of CO2.22,23 We have found that at 12 and 32 °C
there was a loss in the dry weight of both varieties compared to control
(Figure 4). The losses
are significantly higher at 32 °C compared to those at 12 °C.
However, the contents of Chl and Chl b were higher
at 32 °C compared to those at 12 °C; therefore, we would
expect a higher photosynthetic rate and also a higher fixation of
CO2 at 32 °C, translated into dry weight. The inhibition
of photosynthesis caused by high temperatures is often attributed
to the inactivation of membrane-associated proteins, particularly
the complex of photosystem II.24 However,
the fixation of CO2 can be inhibited at other levels. Photosynthesis
can be limited by Rubisco capacity for carboxylation when the plants
are exposed to heat stress. The evidence that the inactivation of
Rubisco is an early event in the inhibition of photosynthesis at elevated
temperatures was presented by several authors (reviewed by ref (25)). Of the various reactions
associated with CO2 fixation, the one that appears to be
most sensitive to inhibition by heat is the activation of Rubisco
by Rubisco activase.24

Figure 4 Loss of dry weight expressed
as percentage with respect to control
in the seedlings of B. oleracea var. acephala and B. oleracea var. capitata grown under 12 and
32 °C. The significant differences among temperatures (p ≤ 0.05) are indicated by different letters. The
significant differences between the crops at a given temperature are
indicated by an asterisk (p ≤ 0.05).

Acephala loses more dry weight
at 12 and 32 °C than capitata;
however, only the differences under heat conditions are significant
(Figure 4). Under cold
conditions, the antioxidant activity of the acephala and capitata
varieties is similar. However, under heat conditions, the acephala
variety shows a significantly higher SOD activity than capitata (Figure 1B). This, together
with a higher GR activity (Figure 1C) and a lower glutathione content (although these
two parameters showed nonsignificant differences), may indicate that
more O2– is being produced in the acephala
variety compared to the capitata one under heat conditions, as SOD,
GR, and glutathione are involved in the detoxification of this ROS
through the Mahler cycle. This may be translated into a lower content
of total Chl and Chl b. These results are in agreement
with those of Rodríguez et al.,2 who found, based on the morphological and physiological parameters,
that the capitata variety was less sensitive to the changes in air
temperature than the acephala one.

3 Conclusions
The relationship among antioxidant defenses, Chl content, and leaf
yield was studied in two B. oleracea crops. Under stress temperatures, the plants increase the antioxidant
defenses, confirming that they suffer oxidative stress. The accumulation
of ROS in chloroplasts would lead to a decrement in Chl and Chl b and to a reduction in the Fv/Fm ratio which suggests the presence
of photoinhibition that produced a loss of dry weight compared to
control conditions. The losses are higher when plants are grown under
heat than under cold conditions, probably because of the inactivation
of Rubisco and/or the associated enzymes with heat. Therefore, the B. oleracea crops seem to be more resilient to cold
than to heat stress, which is probably related to the origin of domestication
of these crops in the Atlantic coast of Europe, where normally temperatures
in summer are mild. Coinciding with previous studies, the acephala
variety is less resilient to temperature stress compared to capitata.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Plant Material and Growth
Conditions
We measured the antioxidant defenses and Chl content
with the same
assay as that used in ref (2). Two local populations of B. oleracea were obtained from the Brassica seed
bank of the Misión Biológica de Galicia (CSIC-Spain),
one cabbage (MBG-BRS0072, B. oleracea capitata group) and one kale (MBG-BRS00464, B. oleracea acephala group).

The plants were grown in sterilized peat (Gramoflor
GmbH & Co. KG, Vechta, Germany) using multipot trays. The fluorescent
light was provided (228 μmol m–2 s–1) in cycles of 14 h light/10 h dark. The plants were watered as needed.
The thresholds of high and low temperatures were established by Rodríguez
et al;2 then, the heat conditions were
set at 32 ± 1 °C and cold conditions at 12 ± 1 °C;
above or below these temperatures, the growth and survival of plants
were seriously compromised. The control condition was set up at 20
± 1 °C, and the plants were grown at constant day/night
temperatures under the three conditions.

4.2 Enzyme
Extraction and Assays
Using
a precooled mortar and pestle, the third leaf of 10 individual plants
per population was homogenized in 10 mL of chilled 100 mM phosphate
buffer, pH 7.0, containing 20 μL of 0.2 M phenylmethylsulfonyl
fluoride at the four-leaf stage. The extracts were centrifuged at
4000 rpm for 3 min, and then the supernatants were used to study the
enzyme activity. All procedures were performed at 4 °C.

The CAT (EC: 1.11.1.6) activity was measured according to the method
used in ref (26). The
samples were diluted 1:10, and then 200 μL of the dilutions
were added to 100 μL of 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 30
mM H2O2. The absorbance of the reaction was
monitored during 1 min at 240 nm. An extinction coefficient of 39.4
M–1 cm–1 was employed to calculate
the enzymatic activity. The data are expressed as enzymatic units
(EU), defined as the decrease of micromoles of H2O2 per milligram of protein per minute.

The GR (EC: 1.6.4.2)
activity was measured following ref (27). The reaction mixture
contained 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), 0.75 μM 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)
(DTNB), 1 μM nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH),
10 μM GSSG, and the enzyme extract in a final volume of 300
μL. The absorbance of the reaction was monitored for 2 min at
412 nm. An extinction coefficient of 6.2 mM–1 cm–1 was employed to calculate the enzymatic activity.
EU is defined as micromoles of TNB per milligram of protein per minute.

The SOD (EC: 1.15.1.1) activity was measured following ref (28). The reaction mixture
contained 100 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, 65 mM nitrotetrazolium
blue chloride (NBT), 2 mM riboflavin, 20 μL enzyme extract,
and 1 μL tetramethylethylenediamine in a final volume of 300
μL. Different concentrations of the enzyme extracts were assayed.
The reaction mixture was exposed to light of 350 μmol m–2 s–1 for 15 min. The SOD activity
was assayed by measuring its ability to inhibit the photochemical
reduction of NBT. EU is defined as the amount of enzyme extract required
to cause 50% inhibition of the rate of NBT reduction at 560 nm. The
protein concentration was measured using the Bradford reagent and
bovine serum albumin as standards.29

4.3 Antioxidant Potential Assays
The
general approach to measure the antioxidant potential was done following
ref (15). Leaves of
10 individual plants per population were harvested at the four-leaf
stage in liquid N2 and then kept at −80 °C.
The samples were freeze-dried for 72 h (BETA 2-8 LD plus, Christ)
and then powdered with an IKA-A10 mill (IKA-Werke GmbH & Co. KG).
The leaf extracts were obtained by adding 1 mL of 80% aqueous methanol
to 10 mg of the leaf sample and leaving it in dark for 24 h. The extracts
were centrifuged afterward (3700 rpm, 5 min). The antioxidant activity
and the content of phenolic compounds were measured in the methanolic
extracts using ABTS+ assay and Folin reagent, respectively.

ABTS+ assay was performed following ref (30). ABTS+ was
generated by the oxidation of 7 mM ABTS with 2.45 mM K2S2O8 at room temperature for 16 h. The stock
solution of ABTS+ was diluted in water to reach an absorbance
between 0.8 and 1.0 at 734 nm. Then, 20 μL of each methanolic
extract was mixed to 250 mL of the ABTS+ solution, and
the absorbance was recorded after 30 min of incubation under dark
conditions. The results were standardized to Trolox equivalents per
gram of dry weight. The total phenolic content was determined following
ref (31). A 50 μL
of each extract was mixed with 50 μL of 0.5 M Folin reagent.
The reaction was neutralized after 5 min with 200 μL of 20%
Na2CO3. After 2 h of incubation in dark conditions,
the absorbance of the reaction was measured at 760 nm. The results
are given as micromoles of gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry
weight.

4.4 Glutathione Determination
Using a
precooled mortar and pestle, the third leaf of 10 individual plants
per population at the four-leaf stage was homogenized in a mixture
of 1 mL of chilled 100 mM phosphate buffer, 2 mM of EDTA, pH 7.4,
and 1 mL of 2 M HClO4. The samples were centrifuged at
4000 rpm for 3 min. The pH values of the resultant supernatants were
neutralized with 2 M KOH and 0.3 M 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic
acid to reach the pH value of 6–7. The samples were conserved
at −80 °C for at least 1 h. In a 96-well microplate, 200
μL of 100 mM phosphate buffer, 2 mM of EDTA, pH 7.4, 10 μL
of NADPH (4 mg/mL in 0.5% NaHCO3), 15 μL of DTNB
(1 mg/mL in 0.5% NaHCO3), and 50 μL of the extract
solution were added. The reaction started after the addition of 25
μL of GR (2 EU/mL in 100 mM phosphate buffer). The total glutathione
(GSH + GSSG) concentration was measured using 100 μM of GSSG
standard.

4.5 Chl Quantification
One hundred milligrams
of the frozen leaf tissue was extracted in 1 mL of acetone overnight
at 4 °C and centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 10 min. The Chl was quantified
from the supernatant spectrophotometrically. The quantification of
Chl a and b was performed as described
in ref (32).

The enzymatic activity, phenolic, glutathione, and Chl content, as
well as the antioxidant potential assay, were monitored spectrophotometrically
(Spectra MR; Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA). Three replicates
were made for each measurement. The reagents were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
Chemie GmbH (Taufkirchen, Germany).

4.6 Dry Weight
Loss
The percentage of
dry weight loss at 12 and 32 °C was computed with respect to
the control temperature taken into account from the data from ref (2).

4.7 Statistical
Analysis
Analyses of
variance were performed using the GLM procedure of SAS.33 The temperatures (12, 20, 32 °C) and populations
(cabbage and kale) were considered as fixed effects, and individual
plants were considered random factors. Fisher’s protected least
significant difference test was employed to compare among different
temperatures, whereas Student’s t test was
used to perform mean comparisons between crops. The correlation analysis
between the biochemical traits obtained in this work and the physiological
and morphological traits obtained by Rodríguez et al.2 were performed with the CORR procedure of SAS.33
