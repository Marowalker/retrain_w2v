Flavokawains have a broad spectrum of biological activities;
however,
the herbicidal activity of these naturally occurring chalcones has
been less investigated. Flavokawains and their analogues were prepared by the Claisen–Schmidt
condensation reaction between xanthoxyline (or aromatic ketones) and
a variety of aromatic and heteroaromatic aldehydes. These compounds
were then evaluated for their inhibitory effect against representative
dicot and monocot plants. Among 45 synthetic chalcones, derivatives
containing phenoxyacetic acid, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl, N-methylpyrrole, or thiophenyl
groups inhibited the germination and growth of Chinese amaranth (Amaranthus tricolor L.) with moderate to high degrees
compared to commercial butachlor. For barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.), most of the
thiophenyl chalcones interrupted shoot and root emergence. This finding
highlighted the importance of functional groups on the herbicidal
activity of chalcones. The level of inhibition also depended on the
applied concentrations, plant species, and plant organs. (E)-2-(2-(3-Oxo-3-(thiophen-2-yl)prop-1-enyl)phenoxy)acetic
acid (14f) was the most active compound among 45 derivatives.
This chalcone could be a promising structure for controlling the germination
and growth of weeds. The structure–activity relationship results
provide useful information about the development of active chalconoids
as novel natural product-like herbicides.

Introduction
Many farmers suffer from problems with
weeds: they compete with
crops for resources and decrease crop yields. Thus, in many parts
of the world, agricultural production is insufficient to meet consumer
demand. These problems have the greatest impact on undeveloped or
developing countries, where agriculture is the main national income.1 Thus, finding an appropriate and effective way
to eliminate undesirable plant species is crucially important. Generally,
there are numerous methods of weeding, such as biological, chemical,
manual, and mechanical.2−5 Among these, herbicides are still widespread.6 Moreover, since the discovery of the concept of allelopathy,7 agrochemists have
been investigating the effect of allelochemicals on weeds and crop
plants to produce natural product herbicides.8−10 Further, to
discover new and effective weed killers, chemists have also formed
derivatives of allelochemicals11−13 to find selective and eco-friendly
herbicides.

Our research group has successfully isolated some
allelochemicals—xanthoxyline
(Figure 1), (±)-odorine,
and oleuropein.14−16 These compounds had a great inhibitory effect on
both tested monocot and dicot weeds. We are interested in adding functional
groups to our natural herbicide, xanthoxyline, to chalcones, to form
new herbicides, which are able to strongly and selectively inhibit
weed germination and growth. We choose the chalcone group (Figure 1) because many reports
have shown that chalcones exhibit strong pharmacological activity,17−20 usually with low toxicity.21 Especially,
naturally occurring chalcones, for example, flavokawains A, B, and
C, which can be modified from xanthoxyline,22−25 have shown a wide range of biological
activities. Besides, several reports26−29 on the herbicidal activities
of Kava root (Piper methysticum L.)
revealed that a series of kava lactones, which have a similar chemical
structure to chalcone, highly inhibited seed germination and seedling
growth of tested plants such as lettuce, radish, and barnyardgrass.
Our recent work30 also indicated that trans-cinnamaldehyde, a chalcone-related compound, greatly
suppressed shoot and root growth of Chinese amaranth and barnyardgrass.
However, to the best of our knowledge, the weed control ability of
flavokawains and related chalcones has not yet been investigated.
Even though the herbicidal activities of some simple trans-chalcones (or 1,3-diphenyl-2-propen-1-one) (Figure 1) have been reported,31−38 there is a small variety of substituents on the rings of tested
chalcones. Therefore, more work is needed to explore the chemical
clues that provide herbicidal activity. Herein, we have designed and
synthesized flavokawains and a series of their analogues. To maximize
the probability of discovering the active compounds, we have explored
a variety of aromatic aldehydes, containing either electron-withdrawing
or electron-donating groups, as well as heteroaromatic aldehydes.
Then, we investigated the structure–activity relationship (SAR)
of these chalcones against representative monocot (barnyardgrass; Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) and dicot (Chinese
amaranth; Amaranthus tricolor L.) plants.30 We aimed to find promising chalcone structures
with good weed control property, so that the gained knowledge could
be applied to find novel herbicides among natural compounds or their
analogues.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Flavokawains A, B, and
C and Their Analogues on Chinese Amaranth
Three flavokawains
(A, B, and C) and 18 chalcones containing both electron-withdrawing
and electron-donating substituents as well as some heteroaromatic
rings (Table 1) were
used for the preliminary screening. These chalcones were prepared
in low to high yields (see the Supporting Information) by the Claisen–Schmidt condensation reaction between xanthoxyline
and a variety of aromatic aldehydes. Flavokawains A and B, together
with chalcones 1–6 and chalcones 8–18, were prepared in ethanol media at room temperature.25 However, flavokawain C and chalcone 7, which is composed of a hydroxyl group on ring B, were prepared
by grinding a mixture of neat starting materials and base in a mortar.39 These 21 compounds were initially evaluated
for their inhibitory activities on seed germination and seedling growth
of Chinese amaranth, a model for dicot plants.30,40

Chalcones

(monitored by TLC).

As most tested chalcones were low-polarity compounds,
polysorbate
80 or Tween 80 was used as a surfactant to enhance the solubility
of chalcones in aqueous media.30,40 For this reason, a
0.10% (v/v) aqueous solution of Tween 80 was then used as a negative
control experiment for all bioassays. A commercial herbicide, butachlor,41 was used as a reference. The preliminary results
showed that at 400 μM, all flavokawains had no effect on seed
germination and seedling growth of Chinese amaranth (Figure 2). Among the 18 flavokawain
derivatives, chalcone 14, which contained a phenoxyacetic
acid ring, slightly suppressed the germination. A thiophenyl derivative 18 also showed strong inhibition of both germination and seedling
emergence. Derivatives comprising a (N,N-dimethyl)aminophenyl group (compound 15) and a N-methylpyrrole group (compound 17) significantly
inhibited root elongation. In contrast, compounds containing methyl
and trifluoromethyl groups (chalcones 1 and 11) slightly promoted root growth of Chinese amaranth. However, other
derivatives containing both electron-withdrawing (including halogens)
and electron-donating substituents at ring B had no significant effect
on the germination and growth.

18 related chalcones on
seed germination (A) and shoot (B) and root (C) growth of Chinese
amaranth. Aqueous solutions of Tween 80 and butachlor were used as
negative and positive references, respectively. Different letters
in each graph indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments. Error bars represent the standard
error of an average of four replicates.

Synthesis and Herbicidal Activity of Other Related Chalcones
on Chinese Amaranth
Results from the previous section indicated
that the most active chalcones generally possess phenoxyacetic acid,
4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl, N-methylpyrrole, or thiophenyl groups. To extensively investigate
the relationship between the structural characteristics of the synthetic
chalcones and their herbicidal activities, chalcones 14a–18f in which ring B or both rings had those functional groups were then
prepared (Table 2).
The yields ranged from moderate to high. The herbicidal potential
of these 24 chalcones at 400 μM on Chinese amaranth was then
evaluated (Figure 3): chalcone 18a slightly inhibited shoot growth of the
plant. Compounds 14a, 15c, 15f, 18c, and 18d suppressed root growth,
while compounds 14b, 17f, and 18f inhibited both shoot and root growths. Chalcones 14f, 17e, and 18e significantly inhibited
seed germination (43%), shoot (50%), and root growth (57%) of Chinese
amaranth, where the metric refers to the fraction of seeds that were
inhibited by the most active herbicide 14f. The effect
of 14f was quite close to the reference herbicide, butachlor,
especially for seed germination. However, other chalcones had no harmful
effect on Chinese amaranth.

solutions of Tween 80 and butachlor were used as negative and positive
controls, respectively. Different letters in each graph indicate significant
differences (p < 0.05) between treatments. Vertical

Herbicidal Activity of All Synthesized Chalcones on Barnyardgrass
For monocots, we used barnyardgrass as a model. All 45 chalcones
could not affect the germination (Figure 4). However, chalcones 14a, 17a, 18a, and 18d slightly inhibited
the shoot growth and compounds 17, 15f,
and 17c slightly inhibited the root length. Chalcones 14f, 17f, 18e, and 18f inhibited both shoot and root elongation. Analogues 18e and 18f showed the highest harmful activity against
shoot emergence by ∼29%, while derivative 14f strongly
suppressed the root length by 51%. Also, butachlor exhibited the largest
inhibitory activity on the tested plant. However, other chalcones
had no significant effect.

synthetic chalcones
on seed germination and shoot and root growth of barnyardgrass. Aqueous
solutions of Tween 80 and butachlor were used as negative and positive
controls, respectively. Different letters in each graph indicate significant
differences (p < 0.05) between treatments. Horizontal
bars represent the standard error of an average of four replicates.

Herbicidal Activity of Chalcone 14f on Chinese
Amaranth and Barnyardgrass
Compound 14f showed
the highest potential to become a chalconoid herbicide. Thus, we measured
the effect of concentrations on its inhibitory activity. The applied
concentrations ranged from 50 to 1600 μM. At the highest concentration,
this chalcone completely inhibited the germination of Chinese amaranth
(Figure 5A) and highly
reduced seed germination (42%), shoot (51%), and root length (79%)
of barnyardgrass (Figure 5B). The degree of inhibition decreased at lower concentrations.
Chalcone 14f could suppress germination and growth of
both plants with concentrations as low as 200 μM.

Figure 5 Inhibitory
effects of chalcone 14f on seed germination,
shoot, and root growths of (A) barnyardgrass and (B) Chinese amaranth.
Aqueous solutions of Tween 80 were used as negative control.

From the above results, the most active synthetic
chalcones generally
contained phenoxyacetic acid, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl, N-methylpyrrole, or thiophenyl
rings. Some herbicides bearing similar functional groups have been
reported previously, for example, phenoxy,42 aminobenzene,43 pyrrole,44 and thiophene45 herbicides.
Even though we should not speculate that the herbicidal potential
and the mode of action of any compounds depend purely on a single
functional group, these structures are still worth mentioning in order
to understand a relationship between substituents and a trend of activity
of those compounds. Apart from those active structures, Groth and
co-workers38 demonstrated that certain
polyhydroxy chalcones, such as okanin (Figure 6), could affect plant growth by selective
inhibition of C4 phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). Apparently,
the potency and selectivity of those active chalcones relied upon
the quantity and position of hydroxyl groups on the chalcone rings
with a higher number of hydroxyls leading to greater effect. This
was quite different from our result that the hydroxyl-bearing compounds
such as flavokawain C and chalcone 7 showed
no activity. In terms of unreactive groups, we found that certain
substituents, such as CH3, CF3, OCH3, isopropyl, isopropoxy, NO2, and halo groups, showed
very low inhibitory activity toward tested plants. This was similar
to Gomes’s work37 that, among their
13 synthesized chalcones, simple trans-chalcone (Figure 1) was the most active
compound against the initial growth of sesame (Sesamum
indicum L.) and brachiaria (Urochloa
decumbens (Stapf) R. D. Webster). Other chalcones
bearing either electron-donating groups (OH, N(CH3)2, or OCH3) or electron-withdrawing groups (NO2 or Cl) showed only low to moderate effects. Apart from the
previously mentioned chalcones, 2,4′-dimethoxychalcone (Figure 6) was reported to
exhibit the allelopathic effect against two weed species: Mimosa pudica and Senna obtusifolia.31 However, there was only chalcone in
this study; therefore, the relationship between structure and activity
of chalcones was unable to compare.

Figure 6 Structures of chalcone herbicides discussed
here.

We showed that some synthesized chalcones at a
concentration of
400 μM inhibited the growth of a crop (Chinese amaranth) and
a weed (barnyardgrass): the detrimental effects of these chalcones
were concentration- and species-dependent. Similar results have been
reported, for example, Chen and co-workers32 evaluated the effect of a trans-chalcone (Figure 1) on the growth of
20 annual plant species and found that this simple chalcone suppressed
the growth of those plants with a wide range of sensitivities depending
on doses and plant species. In addition, Díaz-Tielas and co-workers36 found that at concentrations of 12.5–400
μM, the compound was effective against a variety of crops and
weeds.

The mode of action of chalcones is not yet fully understood.
Chen
et al.33,34 found that trans-chalcone
inhibited lignin biosynthesis in maize (Zea mays L. cv. Yellowcorn) and soybean (Glycine max L. cv. Harosoy 63). Lignin is a complex phenolic polymer found in
the integral xylem and cell walls. It enhances cell wall rigidity,
promotes minerals transport, and confers resistance against various
stresses.46 As it plays an important role
in the growth and development of plants, interference with lignin
biosynthesis can seriously affect growth. Diaz-Tielas et al.35 suggested that this simple chalcone could disrupt
the root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by altering the mitochondrial membrane potential and inducing programmed
cell death. Moreover, as previous mentioned, Groth and co-workers38 found that hydroxychalcones affected plant development
by inhibition of C4 PEPC, a key enzyme for carbon fixation.

Although our work here did not determine the mode of action of
chalcone 14f against the growth and development of the
C4 plants (Chinese amaranth and barnyardgrass), its mechanism could
be attributed to a similar mechanism. However, in general, chalcones
have a wide variety of structures which result in a diverse range
of biological activities. Therefore, other mechanisms of chalcone
herbicide actions should be explored and investigated in order to
understand the advantages of those active compounds, as well as their
functional groups.

We observed that most synthesized chalcones
exhibited more severe
effects on Chinese amaranth than barnyardgrass. This confirmed our
former reports14,30 that allelochemicals, such as
xanthoxyline and trans-cinnamaldehyde, showed a stronger
inhibitory activity against dicots than monocots. We note that barnyardgrass
was more resistant to the applied chemicals than Chinese amaranth,
but it is possible that the chalcones were more specific to Chinese
amaranth than barnyardgrass.

Conclusions
In summary, a series of novel flavokawain
analogues were prepared
in reasonable yields. The first SAR studies of this group of compounds
were carried out against model monocot and dicot plants. Herbicidal
activities of these chalconoids rely upon the groups added to rings
A and B, the applied concentrations, plant species, and organs. Derivatives
containing phenoxyacetic acid, 4-(N,N-dimethylamino)phenyl, N-methylpyrrole, or especially
thiophenyl functional groups showed promising inhibitory activity.
Chalcone 14f (thiophenyl group on ring A and phenoxyacetic
acid group on ring B) was the most potent compound among those synthesized
chalcones and flavokawains. This study gives us a chemical clue that
might boost herbicidal activity. At the highest applied concentration,
chalcone 14f clearly suppressed germination and growth
more than at the lower concentrations. Among the tested species, barnyardgrass
was more tolerant to the applied chemicals than Chinese amaranth and
shoots were more tolerant than roots. Further intensive investigation
is still needed to understand the mode of action of reactive chalcones
and to develop potential natural product-based herbicides.

The Equipment Center, Chulalongkorn University, using residual protonated
chloroform (CDCl3, 7.27 ppm for 1H NMR and 77.00
ppm for 13C NMR), residual protonated methanol (CD3OD, 3.31 ppm for 1H NMR and 49.00 ppm for 13C NMR), or residual protonated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6, 2.50 ppm for 1H NMR and 39.52

mass spectra were recorded on a Bruker micrOTOF II mass spectrometer
at the Faculty of Science, Ramkhamhaeng University, and a Bruker Daltonics
(micrOTOF) at the Faculty of Science, Mahidol University.

Synthesis of Flavokawains and Related Chalcones
A total
of 45 chalcones with different substituents (electron-donating or
electron-withdrawing groups) were synthesized by the Claisen–Schmidt
reaction with slight modifications to the procedures in literature
as follows.

General Procedure A25
To
a mixture of xanthoxyline (1.0 mmol, or other aromatic ketones) and
aromatic aldehydes (1.1 mmol) in ethanol (20 ml), potassium hydroxide
(3.0 mmol) was slowly added. The mixture was continuously stirred
at ambient temperature, until xanthoxyline (or the ketone) was completely
consumed [monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC), usually 12–96
h]. The mixture was then acidified with 1 N HCl (aq) to pH 4–6.
In the case of precipitated chalcones, they were filtered and recrystallized
from methanol. In the other cases, the acidified mixtures were extracted
with ethyl acetate (three times), and then the combined organic layers
were concentrated in vacuo to afford crude products. These crude mixtures
were purified through silica gel column chromatography (EtOAc/hexane)
to obtain the pure compounds.

General Procedure B39
A
mixture of aromatic ketones (1.0 mmol), aromatic aldehydes (1.1 mmol),
and potassium hydroxide (3.0 mmol) was ground or crushed with a mortar
and pestle at room temperature for 20 min or until the reaction was
completed (monitored by TLC). To this mixture, 5 mL of cold distilled
water was added. Then, the mixture was transferred to a 50 ml beaker
and acidified with 1 N HCl (aq) to pH 4–6. The precipitated
solids were filtered, dissolved in methanol, and recrystallized from
the methanol to obtain the pure chalcones.

Preparation of Aqueous Solutions of Butachlor at 400 μM
Butachlor (40 μmol) was well mixed with distilled water in
a 100 mL volumetric flask to produce a 400 μM solution of butachlor.

Aqueous Solution (0.10% (v/v)) of Tween 80
Tween 80
(0.1 mL) and distilled water were thoroughly mixed in a 100 mL volumetric
flask to produce a stock solution of 0.10% (v/v) Tween 80.

Aqueous Solutions of Flavokawains and Related Chalcones at 400
μM
Following our previous work,30 40 μmol of pure chalcone and 0.1 mL of Tween 80 were
thoroughly mixed in a 100 mL beaker followed by adding 40 mL of distilled
water. This solution was then transferred to a 100 mL volumetric flask.
The volume of the solution was adjusted by adding distilled water
to produce a 400 μM solution of chalcone containing 0.10% (v/v)
Tween 80.

Aqueous Solutions of Chalcone 14f at 50, 100, 200,
400, 800, and 1600 μM
Stock solutions of compound 14f at 1600 μM were prepared using the same procedure
as the 400 μM solution. This stock solution was then diluted
with 0.10% (v/v) solution of Tween 80 to produce 800, 400, 200, 100,
and 50 μM solutions.

Tested Plants
Chinese amaranth (A. tricolor L.) and barnyardgrass (E. crus-galli (L.) Beauv.) were tested. Seeds of Chinese amaranth were purchased
from Thai Seed & Agriculture Co. Ltd. (Bangkok, Thailand) and
seeds of barnyardgrass were collected from paddy fields in Phitsanulok
Province (16°48′57″N 100°15′49″E,
Thailand). Both plants showed >80% germination.

Seed Germination and Seedling Growth Bioassay30
Following our previous work,30 to a small vial (45 mm × 20 mm) lined with germination
paper, 0.5 mL aqueous solution of Tween 80 (or aqueous solutions of
chalcones) was added. Ten seeds of the tested plant were placed onto
the paper and the vials were then sealed with Parafilm. These vials
were kept in a growth chamber (cool white 840 Climacell 707, Munich,
Germany) at 28–30 °C with a photoperiod of 12 h (light
intensity 100 μmol m–2·s–1) and 80% relative humidity. Each treatment was replicated four times.
After 7 days, the germinated seeds were counted, and both shoot and
root lengths were measured. Inhibition of germination and early growth
of the tested plants was then calculated:  

Statistical Analysis
For data analysis, a completely
randomized design with four replications was used. Control experiments
were conducted under the same conditions but without chalcones. Analysis
of variance was used for all bioassays, and treatments were compared
using Tukey’s studentized range test at a probability level
of p ≤ 0.05.
