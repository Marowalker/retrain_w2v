Herein, we reported
a chemiluminescent biosensor based on the covalent
immobilization of the horseradish peroxidase (HRP) enzyme on a polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) support to quantify in situ hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The chemiluminescent reaction based on the use of
luminol as an oxidizable substrate, with HRP as the catalyst, has
been used in order to quantify H2O2 as the oxidizing
agent. The performance of the proposed biosensor has been demonstrated
to determine H2O2 liberated by cells in a culture
medium and for evaluating the delivery of H2O2 from denture cleaner tablets, as examples of application. For both
analyses, the results indicated that the biosensor is cost-effective,
sensitive, and selective with a detection limit of 0.02 μM and
good linearity over the range 0.06–10 μM. Precision was
also satisfactory (relative standard deviation, % RSD < 6). The
strength of this biosensing system is the simplicity, portability,
and reusability of the devices; it can be applied up to 60 times with
90% of its activity maintained.

1 Introduction
In
situ monitoring technologies appeared as an advance for complementing
the classical methods in the laboratory. Traditional chemistry analysis
sometimes means that a process takes so long that it impedes a quick
actuation in the case of not expected outcomes.1

In this context, biosensors appear as a reliable
alternative which
can be applied to numerous analytical processes in several fields
such as healthcare and food and drink industry including environmental
and security monitoring.2−4 The ideal sensor has to be selective,
sensitive, cheap, portable, and reusable. Enzymatic biosensors are
thoroughly used in analytical determinations because of their high
selectivity and sensitivity.5 Most of the
sensors are for just one use because of the limitation of the reagents
employed or their format. The reusability of the sensor depends on
the immobilization procedure. Covalent immobilization can be an optimal
alternative to keep the enzyme attached on the surface and avoid its
desorption with the use of the biosensor. Enzyme binding can be carried
out from the activation of the support surface using multifunctional
reagents.6−9 This approach can be combined with the use of portable instruments
for both transduction and in situ analysis, and these instruments
are smaller and cheaper than laboratory analytical instruments and
easy to handle by nonqualified personnel. Moreover, the possibility
of miniaturization makes the analysis more cost-effective because
of the reduction of analysis time and needed reagents.

Hydrogen
peroxide (H2O2) is present in a
large variety of products and it has a great importance in pharmaceutical,
clinical, chemical, industrial, and environmental analyses.10−14 H2O2 is considered one of the reactive oxygen
species, and it can be found in human fluids. Although it is poorly
reactive, it is able to form other highly reactive intermediates such
as hydroxyl radical (OH•). On the other hand, H2O2 is known to be an inter- and intracellular signaling
molecule which regulates cellular processes. Thus, the H2O2 concentration in biofluids can be altered in many disease
conditions including cancer, diabetes mellitus, Alzheimer, atherosclerosis,
and Parkinson’s disease among others, considering that it is
a biomarker of oxidative stress.15−18 Furthermore, H2O2 is widely used in industry because of its oxidizing power.
It is antibacterial, antifungal, antimold, and antiviral.19

Until now, several sensors have been reported
for determining H2O2 in different matrices through
enzymatic reactions,
using peroxidase reactions such as horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The
assayed enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of a wide variety of organic
compounds such as 3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS), N,N-diethyl-p-phenylenediamine
(DPD), o-phenylenediamine (OPD), 3,3′-diaminobenzidine
(DAB), 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethyl-benzidine (TMB), or luminol.20−22 These methods include both electrochemical12,23−28 and optical techniques.20,29−34 Amplex Red derivatives, instead of luminol and colorimetric substrates,
are also applied to quantify hydrogen peroxide in the presence of
HRP with fluorescence and 1,1′-oxalyldiimidazole chemiluminescence
(CL) detection.35 In addition, hydrogen
peroxide in a sample can be quantified with fluorescent and luminescent
probes without HRP.35−37 However, as far as we know, there are no publications
in the literature where a portable and reusable HRP sensor is developed.
Optical techniques appear as an alternative, specifically in terms
of luminescence, by virtue of their high sensitivity and selectivity,
especially by using bioluminescence/CL, to the electrochemical methods,
which can present sometimes a lack of robustness.38

CL does not need an excitation source, often it is
performed in
dynamic conditions such as flow injection analysis.39−41 It should be
marked that the luminescence signal can be measured with portable
instruments. Thus, it is a challenge to develop in situ CL procedures
by using robust devices. In this context, we propose an in situ, reusable,
stable device for H2O2 determination by using
a portable luminometer as a transductor. The reaction is based on
the luminol oxidation reaction carried out by H2O2 and catalyzed by HRP, which is covalently immobilized on a PDMS
surface placed in a polystyrene tube. The results revealed that the
developed method displays good selectivity and sensitivity toward
H2O2 with a low limit of detection (LOD). Also,
it demonstrates its successfully applicability to detect H2O2 in a culture medium, which was in contact with cells,
and to measure the H2O2 release by denture cleaner
tablets. In addition, it is shown that the developed sensor provided
security, rapidity, and cost-effectiveness in reference to other methods.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimization of the Biosensor
The
support matrix has to provide a biocompatible and inert environment
and it should not interfere with the native structure of the protein;
polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is a good choice because it offers an
appropriate way to fix biomolecules because of its porosity, optical
transparent matrix, low temperature curing, and inherent versatility.20 The enzyme covalent binding onto the activated
PDMS surface is a critical factor to develop the biosensor. In order
to perform it, a combination of different procedures described in
the literature was used.6,7,9Figure 1 illustrates
the procedures for the biofunctionalization of the PDMS to obtain
the biosensor. PDMS solidified at the bottom of the polystyrene tube,
and then the surface was activated with hydroxyl groups (1), followed
by the amino-functionalization of the activated PDMS (2) and addition
of glutaraldehyde (3), and finally the HRP was covalently immobilized
on the polymer (4) (see Section 4.3 for more experimental details). Figure 2 shows the obtained attenuated total reflectance–Fourier
transform infrared (ATR–FTIR) spectra, which are in accordance
with the several steps for obtaining the biofunctionalized sensor.
PDMS has several characteristic infrared bands; at 2962 cm–1 (C–H stretching in CH3), 1259 cm–1 (CH3 symmetric bending in Si–CH3),
1076 and 1018 cm–1 (Si–O–Si), and
798 cm–1 (CH3 rocking in Si–CH3), whereas activated PDMS also showed a band centered at around
3350 cm–1 which was assigned to the O–H stretch
of surface silanol groups.42 After PDMS
surface modification with 3-aminopropyl trimethoxylane (APTMS), the
absorption at 3350 cm–1 decreases and a band at
1680 cm–1 appeared after APTMS and glutaraldehyde
reaction, indicating the C=N vibration. Finally, after HRP
immobilized on PDMS, the HRP functional groups emerged at around 3315
cm–1 because of the association of the N–H
stretching and at 1510 and 1620 cm–1 related to
the stretching band of −CONH– (amide I) and (amide II)
vibrations in HRP. These results demonstrated that the HRP was successfully
immobilized on PDMS. The morphology has been characterized by electronic
microscopy. The PDMS composite surface is homogeneous in accordance
with a nonporous material (see Figure 2).

see the text and Figure 1).

Here, we avoided the use of cyanoborohydride
described in the literature7 because it
is a toxic reagent and its addition
did not favor the immobilization process. On the other hand, two different
options of performing the linking between the glutaraldehyde (GTA)
and HRP were tested in order to study the influence of this step in
the immobilization process. The first one consisted of linking the
GTA to APTMS after HRP and the second one was to obtain the cross-linked
enzyme aggregates with GTA and HRP, and the aggregates were linked
to APTMS. Although the reagents are placed in a different order, no
differences were obtained between the results obtained. In both cases,
the response was similar, and thus, we concluded that the order did
not affect the amount of enzyme immobilized on the PDMS. According
to the results, the first option was selected for further experiments
as it was the simplest process.

Different concentrations of
the enzyme (between 0.005 and 5 mg·mL–1) were
used to functionalize the PDMS for selecting
the most efficient HRP concentration for preparing the biosensor.
The response of these prepared biosensors were tested by employing
H2O2 (50 μM) in the presence of luminol
(17.5 mM) measured after 10 s with a portable luminometer (Figure
S1 in the Supporting Information, SI).
The obtained results indicated that the concentration of the enzyme
should be higher than 0.1 mg·mL–1 for achieving
the maximum response. Solutions used for HRP immobilization were not
discarded, and they were used for other purposes because the remaining
enzyme was still active.

Under the chosen conditions, the results
indicated (see Figure S2 in the Supporting
Information and Section 4.4) that the theoretical
concentration of active HRP immobilized to the PDMS surface was 0.0156
mg·mL–1 (0.023 U). Similar results (0.02 U)
were obtained by employing 2.5 μM H2O2 for the biosensors prepared by incubating them with 0.1 and 1 mg·mL–1 concentrations of HRP enzyme solution. Moreover,
the precision of sensor fabrication was suitable for obtaining 4.2%
intraday (n = 6) and 5.9% interday (n = 3) as relative standard deviations (% RSD).

2.2 Optimization of the Reaction Conditions
To study the
kinetics of the reaction and optimize the concentration
of the reagents required, first, it was carried out in solution using
a conventional spectrofluorimeter (Figure 3A,B) in order to detect the transient signal.
Different concentrations of luminol in a range of 0.017 and 17 mM
were assayed for a constant concentration of HRP and H2O2 at 1.22 mg L–1 and 0.478 mM, respectively
(Figure 3A). From 1.7
mM of luminol, the luminescence signal was less dependent on the luminol
concentration, as can be seen in Figure 3A. The reaction was also studied by varying
HRP concentrations between 0.36 and 12.2 mg L–1 and
maintaining luminol and H2O2 concentrations
constant at 17 and 0.478 mM, respectively (Figure 3B); almost a saturated signal at an HRP concentration
of 12.2 mg L–1 was obtained. The linear range for
HRP was found from 0.5 to 10 mg L–1.

conditions: (A) luminol concentration
(0.017, 0.17, 1.7, and 17 mM) and (B) HRP concentration [0.36 (a),

and (D) by using the biosensor and a portable luminometer. (E) Reusability
of the biosensor expressed as relative activity (%).

Different concentrations of luminol were tested employing
the biosensor
and the portable luminometer, in the presence of H2O2 (50 μM) and measuring at 10 s. It can be observed in Figure 3C that the luminescence
intensities increase with the luminol concentrations until 17.5 mM
and after the signal is stabilized. The selected luminol concentration
was 17.5 mM.

Additionally, the response of the developed sensor
to H2O2 concentration (0.1–10 μM)
was studied
in a portable luminometer by recording the luminescence signal during
40 s (Figure 3D). As
it can be seen, the transient signal was also observed and the results
showed that in every studied concentration at 10 s, the light intensity
decreased slowly over time until 40 s. The selected time was 10 s
achieving a good sensitivity and precision.

2.3 Enzyme
Activity Measurements
The
kinetic parameters were evaluated recording the luminescence signal
at 0 and 40 s. The initial rate was calculated by the difference between
these two signals. The kinetic behavior of HRP was studied in solution
(with hydrogen peroxide and sodium percarbonate) and in the developed
sensor which contained HRP covalently bound to the PDMS support. Each
experiment was repeated 3 times.

The Km and Vmax parameters were estimated
through the Lineweaver–Burk linearization where the inverse
of the velocity was plotted against the inverse of the substrate concentration
(Figure S3). The Vmax was estimated from the Y-intercept and
the Km was estimated from the X-intercept (see Section 4.5).

The “apparent” Km obtained
in solution and with the biosensor for the H2O2 and the sodium percarbonate which liberates H2O2 was similar. The Vmax value was higher
in solution than by using the sensor including both reagents, and
this could be because the Vmax value depends
on the catalytic capacity of HRP and it could be something less in
the sensor because of the immobilization process.

2.4 Analytical Parameters, Stability, and Reusability
The
system HRP luminol-H2O2 has been used
in many CL assays.43 Peroxidases are usually
preferred because luminol can be oxidized in mild conditions and hydrogen
peroxide is the most significant oxidizing agent, which increases
the luminescent intensity of luminol. Interference may be due to an
alteration in the catalytic activity, redox properties, or chemical
reactivity with the luminol mixture. A critical discussion about this
topic can be found in ref (43).

As shown in Table 1, a linear behavior was observed between the analytical
signals and the standards of H2O2 at a range
of concentrations, 0.06–10 μM. The LOD of the developed
biosensor was estimated as 0.02 μM, and it was calculated as
3 Sblank/b, where b is the slope of the linear calibration curve and Sblank is the standard deviation of the several
measurements of blank solutions. For the developed biosensor, the
precision was evaluated by obtaining the intra- and interday relative
standard deviations (% RSDs) under optimized experimental conditions
(200 μL of 10 μM H2O2 and 200 μL
of 35 mM luminol). The proposed procedure provided satisfactory %
RSD values being lower than 10% in all instances. According to these
results, the precision of the method was suitable and no differences
were observed between devices.

The
stability of the biosensor over time was examined by comparing
the response of three sensors used on the same day they were prepared
with the responses of three sensors used after several months of storage
at −20 °C. The biosensor retained its activity unchanged
for at least 3 months (see Figure 3E).

The biosensor reusability was also studied
by using a freshly prepared
solution of H2O2 with fixed concentration (50
μM). To check this property, the sensor was used and water-cleaned
before reusing again. The HRP activity remains unchanged after 30
uses (with 99.5% of activity compared with the first use), and after
60 uses, the activity was 92%. The activity of the biosensor decreased
gradually after the 60 uses, obtaining 47% of activity in 75 uses.
In the same session (n = 15), the RSD % of the signals
was <10% (Figure 3E). The results indicated that this biosensor maintained its properties,
which are stable over time (at least 3 months stored in the freezer)
and a reusability of at least 60 times.

We compared the reusability
of the PDMS biosensor with that achieved
by HRP immobilization in polystyrene. From fabrication perspective,
namely, easy of prototyping and low cost, PDMS is superior to polystyrene.44 The immobilization of HRP on the polystyrene
tube by ultrasonication45 and by using
3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (3-APTES) as a linker46 was tested. However, after 5 uses, the HRP activity was
reduced to 81% with the first method and 20% with the second method.
We also tested the same procedure to anchor the enzyme on the PDMS
for polystyrene, and the remaining activity after 5 uses was 56%.
Therefore, the PDMS matrix was more efficient because it allows reuse
of the tube up to 60 times.

2.5 Determination of Hydrogen
Peroxide in Real
Samples
Showing the applicability of the biosensor, the released
H2O2 in relevant different matrices has been
detected: culture medium DMEM-F12 in contact with cells and a commercial
product (Corega Oxígeno Bio-Activo tablets) for cleaning the
denture.

2.5.1 Culture Medium of Cells
The H2O2 produced by neuroblast cells in culture medium
DMEM-F12 was determined. Previously, the influence of the culture
medium in the determination was evaluated. The matrix effect was observed
in the presence of the medium, and the H2O2 concentration
had to be calculated by interpolation in the respective calibration
curve obtained for standards containing the culture medium instead
of water. The results are summarized in Table 2. In order to study the accuracy of the method,
the culture medium incubated with cells was fortified with 2 μM
H2O2. Data of recovery were between 93 and 109%,
and thus, these results confirm that this biosensor is appropriated
for the extracellular hydrogen peroxide determination. The RSD obtained
was 7.7%. In three of the seven samples assayed, the cells liberated
H2O2 (see Table 2).

2.5.2 Corega
Oxígeno Bio-Activo Tablets
The main cleaning agent
in Corega Oxígeno Bio-Activo tablets
is sodium percarbonate (Na2CO3·2H2O2) which carries out the process by the liberation of
hydrogen peroxide. The aim of this study was to follow the H2O2 released from the tablets by using the biosensor proposed.
H2O2 concentration was determined in the solution
containing one tablet during 3 min, which is the time indicated by
the manufacturer to perform the cleaning process. The matrix effect
was observed, and it was corrected by the standard addition method
at every time. The concentrations found at different measuring times
are shown in Figure S4 (see the Supporting
Information) for releasing in the presence or absence of the denture.
H2O2 is released over time until achieving a
state stationary at 180 s in both the mentioned cases. At this time,
it is supposed that the H2O2 is completely released.
The H2O2 concentration found at 180 s expressed
as Na2CO3·2H2O2 was
5.3%, calculated in water. The results are according to those indicated
by the manufacturer (<10% Na2CO3·2H2O2).

The proposed biosensor allows the direct
determination of H2O2 in a variety of different
samples. Moreover, the sensor is able to determine H2O2 from indirect reaction which generates H2O2 too.

2.6 Comparison with Other Methods
for Peroxide
Determination through Biosensors
In Table 3, a variety of optical and electrochemical
methods used for determination of hydrogen peroxide including supported
HRP as the enzyme have been compared. Analytical parameters such as
the analytical signal, detection limit, and linear range have been
summarized. Others important characteristics such as portability,
reusability, and stability have been included. The terminology portability
has been considered when the measuring instrument can easily be moved
to the sampling place with the operator (weight < 2 kg) and it
does not require to be connected to the supply; therefore, it has
a reliable battery system.

Although luminescence methods present lower LODs30−33 than spectrophotometric methods,20,24 only one reported article allows the reutilization of the sensor
by 7 times; in addition, it is not a portable sensor and it is not
tested in real samples.32 The fluorescence
method was not very successful because of the higher LOD of the sensor;
however, it is reusable, but it has not been reported many times.29 Electrochemical methods are not usually tested
in real samples; therefore, difficulties from the sample analysis
are not described.25,27,28 As we know, there is only one article which provides a lower linear
range than the proposed biosensor; however it does not allow in situ
monitoring because it is not portable and it needs a power supply.24 Although Dai et al. proposed a reusable amperometric
sensor, the LOD achieved was higher than that achieved by the proposed
biosensor, and in addition, the stability is not reported.26

Amplex Red has widely been described for
quantifying H2O2 at very low levels. Qian et
al. developed a ratiometric
sensor using a combination of Amplex Red and fluorescent scopoletin
capable of detecting H2O2 concentrations at
150 nM (higher than that provided by the proposed biosensor). However,
the ratiometric sensor requires incubation at 25 °C for 5 h.36 Similar commercial assays using Amplex Red,
in the best cases, require incubation at room temperature for at least
20–30 min.

The biosensor proposed here shows great results
by comparing the
abovementioned parameters with those given in Table 3 for other methods. The developed biosensor
allows the determination of H2O2 with a good
LOD and linear range and to determine it in situ using a portable
luminometer as the transductor. Moreover, the covalent binding of
the HRP permits the reusability of the sensor, and in this case, the
biosensor can be used more than 60 times. Concerning the stability,
the biosensor can be used after a long time (more than 3 months) of
its fabrication by storing it in a freezer.

It should be marked
that the developed biosensor allows reducing
costs in reagents because of its small size; in addition, it provides
reduced toxicity compared with other methods and simplifies the analysis.
Moreover, a nonqualified operator could carry out the assay. On the
other hand, chemiluminescent probes demonstrated to be very sensitive
to H2O2 and allow very fast detection (in few
seconds). This characteristic is very suitable in order to carry out
studies about the H2O2 liberation. Our strategy
to improve the cost efficiency of the assay has been to study the
immobilization of the enzymatic catalyst (HRP) onto a solid PDMS-based
support in order to obtain a reusable biosensor, in addition to propose
a portable assay for in situ H2O2 determination.

3 Conclusions
In the present study, a novel
H2O2 biosensor
based on an enzymatic reaction has been developed. The sensor has
been fabricated using a simple immobilization methodology of the HRP
enzyme on an activate PDMS surface. The chemiluminescent signal with
respect to the H2O2 concentration was measured
by using a portable luminometer for transduction. Optimization of
the enzyme immobilization was carried out in order to get a maximum
signal and better accuracy results. This method has appropriate figures
of merit, such as high sensitivity, and provides in situ measurements
with high accuracy. Moreover, the measurements can be obtained in
a very short time (just 10 s).

The biosensor satisfies the standards
in terms of precision, robustness,
and stability; moreover, it should be noticed that the device is reusable,
allowing its use more than sixty times. The results revealed that
the biosensor is a simple and reliable device for the quantitative
determination of hydrogen peroxide by achieving a wide linear range,
low detection limit, and fast response time. The biosensor has long-term
applications because of the hydrogen peroxide implicated in a wide
variety of reactions. In this case, hydrogen peroxide determination
was carried out in extracellular fluid and Corega Oxígeno Bio-Activo
tablets without any sample preparation.

and Methods
4.1 Reagents and Standard Solutions
Nanopure
water obtained using the Nanopure II system (Barnstead, USA) was used
for preparation and dilution of all solutions. The SYLGARD 184 silicon
elastomer base and SYLGARD 184 silicon elastomer curing agent were
provided from Dow Corning (Michigan, US). Luminol, HRP (147 U·mg–1), chlorhydric acid, APTMS, isopropanol, sodium percarbonate
(Na2CO3·2H2O2), and
GTA were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Saint Louis, USA). Hydrogen
peroxide 30% (v/v), sodium phosphate monobasic (NaH2PO4), potassium phosphate dibasic (K2HPO4), sodium hydrogencarbonate (NaHCO3), and sodium carbonate
(Na2CO3) were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt,
Germany). Acetic acid was acquired from Scharlau (Barcelona, Spain).
Polystyrene tubes were obtained from Labbox (Barcelona, Spain).

Solution A: 1 mL APTMS, 5 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid, and 5 mL of isopropanol
were mixed in a plastic container. The mixture was stirred for 2 h
at room temperature, and then, 89 mL of residual isopropanol was added
into it.

Stock solution of 5% glutaraldehyde was made in 0.1
M sodium phosphate
buffer solution (pH = 7.0).

Stock solution of 35 mM luminol
solution was prepared by dissolving
an appropriate amount of luminol in buffer 0.3 M HCO3–/CO32– pH = 10.8. The
mixture was stirred for 15 min in Vortex. The solution was prepared
fresh daily.

Enzyme stock solution was prepared in nanopure
water, and the working
solutions were prepared by gradually diluting stock solution (0.005,
0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 5 mg·mL–1). The HRP stock solution was stored in the freezer until required.

Working solutions of H2O2 were prepared fresh
daily by dilution of 30% (v/v) H2O2.

4.2 Instrumentation
Morphology was studied
with a Hitachi S-4800 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 20 keV over metalized samples with a mixture of gold and
palladium during 30 s.

ATR–FTIR spectra were recorded
using a Cary 630 FTIR spectrometer equipped with a diamond ATR sampling
accessory from Agilent Technologies (Böblingen, Germany). Spectra
were recorded at a resolution of 4 cm–1. For data
collection, MicroLab FTIR software from Agilent Technologies was used;
for data processing, Resolutions Pro software (Agilent Technologies)
was used.

Luminescence measurements were recorded by using a
portable tube
luminometer from Berthold Technologies (Bad Wildbad, Germany) and
a Jasco FP 750 spectrofluorometer (Tokyo, Japan). The emission was
measured inside the transparent polystyrene tubes which contained
the developed biosensor. For preparing the solutions, a Vortex mixer
from Labnet International (New Jersey, USA) was used.

4.3 Preparation of the Biosensor
The
preparation of the biosensor was carried out by covalent immobilization
of HRP on functionalized PDMS deposited into a polystyrene tube. The
PDMS polymer was formed on the bottom of the tube by depositing a
mixture of 200 μL of the PDMS elastomer base and the curing
reagent in a 10:1 (v/v) proportion and curing the mixture at 30 °C
for 24 h. The PDMS surface was activated by adding an acidic solution
containing H2O, 37% HCl, and 30% H2O2 in a 5:1:1 (v/v/v) ratio. After 2 h, the tube was washed with distilled
water. The amino-silanization process was carried out by incubating
the modified PDMS surface with the solution A, which contained APTMS
and drying the tube at 70 °C for 2 h. The resulting modified
PDMS surface was treated with a 5% w/w GTA solution in order to form
a Schiff base. Then, the tubes were washed two times with phosphate
buffer solution pH = 7 and two times with distilled water. Finally,
the functionalized PDMS surface was incubated with a HRP enzyme solution
(between 0.005 and 5 mg·mL–1) for 1 h. Thereafter,
the tube was washed three times with phosphate buffer solution pH
= 7.

4.4 Measuring the Activity of the Immobilized
HRP
A calibration curve in solution was carried out for determining
the activity of the immobilized HRP. Two calibration curves were obtained
by keeping H2O2 and luminol concentration constant
(50 or 2.5 μM and 17.5 mM, respectively) and varying the HRP
concentration between 0.004 and 0.022 mg mL–1. Therefore,
the luminescence signal obtained with the biosensor by adding 50 μM
(incubated with HRP enzyme solution between 0.005 and 5 mg·mL–1) or 2.5 μM of H2O2 (incubated
with HRP enzyme solutions of 0.1 and 1 mg·mL–1) and 17.5 mM of luminol was interpolated in the calibration curve.
The measurements were carried out after 10 s of the H2O2 addition with a portable luminometer for transduction.

4.5 Kinetic Analysis
A kinetic study
has been carried out in solution by adding 10 μL of 0.01 mg·mL–1 of HRP to the tube containing 200 μL of 35
mM luminol (buffer 0.3 M HCO3–/CO3–2 pH = 10.8) and a variable concentration
of H2O2 (0.5–20 μM). Moreover,
the same procedure was carried out with the biosensor in the tube,
which contained the immobilized HRP. The luminescent signal was captured
at 0 and 40 s in both cases. Time 0 was established as the first measurement
after the addition of the H2O2 standard. The
reaction rate was calculated by the difference between both signals.

Vmax and Km parameters were estimated through the Lineweaver–Burk linearization
(eq 1), where 1/v was plotted against 1/|S|. Vmax is the velocity that would be reached when all the
enzyme active sites are saturated with the substrate, and Km is defined as the substrate concentration
at which a half of the active sites are filled; these parameters characterize
the affinity of the enzyme to the substrate. 1  

4.6 Analytical Parameters
The linear
range was defined by plotting the luminescence signal at 10 s versus
H2O2 concentration, and the correlation coefficient
had to be better than 0.99. The assays were carried out with the tube,
which contained the HRP immobilized. Two hundred microliters of 35
mM luminol was added, followed by 200 μL of H2O2 standard solution between 0.05 and 200 μM. The detection
limit (LOD) was calculated as 3 Sblank/b, where b is the slope of the
linear calibration curve and Sblank is
the standard deviation of blank solutions (n = 10).
Precision was evaluated (n = 3) and expressed as
intra- and interday relative standard deviations (RSDs) under experimental
conditions (200 μL of 10 μM H2O2 and 200 μL of 35 mM luminol) for standards in the linear interval.
Stability was estimated by comparing the response of three sensors
over several months after their storage at −20 °C. The
biosensor reusability was studied using freshly prepared solution
of H2O2 with fixed concentration (50 μM);
the biosensor was used up to 150 times.

4.7 Analysis
of Culture Medium Containing Cells
Samples of culture medium
DMEM-F12 GlutaMAX Supplement incubated
with neuroblast cells have been analyzed. The medium also contains
10% fetal bovine serum, l-glutamine, and penicillin–streptomycin.
The samples were stored at −70 °C in the freezer. After
melting the samples, they were diluted 10 times with water. To carry
out the analysis, 200 μL of 35 mM luminol was placed in the
tube containing the biosensor with the enzyme bounded; then, 200 μL
of the diluted samples were added in order to start the reaction.
The CL signal was captured at 10 s.

4.8 Analysis
of Corega Oxigen Bio-Active
One tablet of Corega Oxígeno
Bio-Activo was dissolved in 100
mL of water with or without a denture. The H2O2 released from tablets was measured for up to 3 min (time recommended
to clean the denture by Corega). At different times, 200 μL
of the sample was taken and diluted in 10 mL of water. To carry out
the analysis, 200 μL of luminol 35 mM was placed on the biosensor,
and then, 200 μL of the diluted samples was added in order to
start the reaction. The CL signal was registered at 10 s. The manufacturer
indicates that the Na2CO3·2H2O2 concentration is <10%.
