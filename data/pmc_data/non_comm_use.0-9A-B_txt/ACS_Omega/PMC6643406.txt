Electrode–electrolyte
microscopic interfacial studies are
of great interest for the design and development of functional materials
for energy storage and catalysis applications. First-principles-based
simulation methods are used here to understand the structure, stability,
energetics, and microscopic adsorption mechanism of various hydrophilic
and hydrophobic ionic liquids (ILs; 1-butyl 3-methylimidazolium [BMIm]+[X]−, where X = Cl, DCA, HCOO, BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, OTF, and TFSA) interacting
with a metallic surface. We have selected the Au(111) surface as a
potential electrode model, and our computations show that ILs (anions
and cations) adsorb specifically at some selective adsorption sites.
Indeed, hydrophilic anions of ILs are strongly adsorbed on the gold
surface (via Au–Cl and Au–N bonds at Au(111)), whereas
hydrophobic anions are weakly bonded. The [BMIm]+ is always
found to be stabilized parallel to the metal surface, irrespective
of the nature of the anion, through various kinds of noncovalent interactions.
Mulliken, Löwdin, and Hirshfeld charge analyses reveal that
there is significant charge transfer between ILs and the surface that
may enhance the charge transfer mechanism between the surface and
electrolytes for electrochemical applications. Our study shows that
the electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are in action at
these interfaces. Moreover, we show that there are several covalent
and noncovalent interactions between ILs and the metal surface. These
interactions play an essential role to maintain the electrostatic
behaviors at the solid–liquid interface. The present findings
can be helpful to predict specific selectivity and subsequent design
of materials for energy harvesting and catalysis applications.

1 Introduction
The electrode–electrolyte
interface studies are of great
importance to understand the interfacial phenomena for the design
and development of functional materials for various applications such
as supercapacitors, batteries, and catalysis.1,2 Several
experimental and theoretical works have been devoted to the understanding
of the interfacial structure and reactivity of molecules at these
interfaces.3−5 Particularly, allotropes of carbon (i.e., graphene,
carbon nanotube, fullerene, etc.) interacting with ionic liquid (IL)
electrolytes received special attention because these materials present
potential applications for energy storage in Li-ion batteries, supercapacitors,
and lubricants and as anticorrosive.6−12 More generally, these investigations aim to tackle new challenges
to elucidate the energy storage mechanisms and to enhance the storage
capacities.13,14

Room-temperature ionic
liquids (RTILs) are mainly composed of organic
cations and inorganic anions. The great interest in these ILs stems
from their specific properties such as high ionic conductivity,15 nonflammability,16 high thermal stability,17 low vapor pressure,
and wide electrochemical window.18 Moreover,
the behavior of RTILs at charged surfaces can be used toward the applications
of supercapacitors,19 of electrochemical
sensors,20 in catalysis,21 and in energy storage.22 This
is mainly due to the electrostatic interaction between electrode and
electrolyte surfaces and to the formation of a second layer of ILs
in the vicinity of these surfaces. These structures are known as electrical
double layer (EDL).23 The EDL part of composites
plays an essential role in the energy storage and conversion.

Two-dimensional (2D) metal-surface-based electrode materials are
also potential candidates for applications of energy storage devices.24 Al, Ni, Pt, and noble metals such as Cu, Ag,
and Au are of prime importance as materials for such devices.25−31 Among these composite materials, Au atoms on the electrode surface
are good candidates because they have higher surface atom density
and stronger van der Waals (vdWs) interactions than those of the other
metallic surfaces.32 Gold surface Au(111)–IL
composite materials (i.e., ILs@Au(111)) exhibit high conductivity,
high thermal and chemical stabilities, and compatibility for material
design.33 Thus, they are commonly used
as an electrode–electrolyte model. Moreover, it is established
that these composites improve the performance of printed circuit boards
when compared to that of other electrode materials (e.g., Ag).34

Recent theoretical studies predicted the
importance of regium bond
between coinage metal clusters and aromatic π-systems and N-based
nucleophiles.35,36 These studies revealed that the
strength of the interaction between these complexes mainly follow
the basicity of the nucleophiles and the calculated regium bond energies
are above ∼30 kcal/mol. However, aromatic system energies range
from ∼7 to 30 kcal/mol. Particularly, gold complexes achieved
strong binding than the other metals. This shows that gold metal plays
an important role in molecular adsorption and catalytic applications,
which is important to understand the adsorption mechanism at the microscopic
level. This is in line with our findings on ILs at Au(111) surfaces
because of the strong adsorption of both the alkyl chain and the cationic
part of the imidazolium ring.

To understand the effect of anions–cations
in ILs and the
adsorption mechanism of the alkyl chain, several studies dealing with
gold–IL interfaces have been reported.37−44 For instance, Pan et al. observed a 2D phase transition of PF6 adlayers at the electrified Au(111)–IL interface using
the in situ scanning tunneling microscope (STM) technique. After application
of positive potential, they showed the formation of surface etching
and ordered adlayers at the Au(111) electrode. This is attributed
to different solvation effects of PF6 in ionic liquids
compared to those in aqueous solution.38 Moreover, Maier and co-workers studied the adsorption behavior,
orientation, and growth of ILs on the Au(111) surface using angle-resolved
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their work pointed out the
arrangement of 1,1-dimethylimidazolium-bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
([MMIm]+[TFSA]−) and 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium
([OMIm]+[TFSA]−) on the Au(111) surface.39 Later on, Wen et al. studied the molecular arrangement
and surface dynamics of different ILs ((hexyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide HMIm]+ with Cl− and [TFSA]−) at the Au(111) surface using in situ
high-speed STM. They found a possible dependent adlayer structure
of adsorbed [HMIm]+ and [Cl]− at the
gold surface.40 The elucidation of such
effect is among the aims of the present first-principles investigations.

Recently, the influence of alkyl chains in the cations at the Au(100)
and Au(111) surfaces was studied by experimental techniques.41,42 The in situ STM study revealed the formation of an ordered “micellelike”
structure at the Au(100) surface and of irregular “wormlike”
structure at the Au(111) surface. Su et al. performed an STM study
of BMIm-BF4@Au(111) (solid–liquid interface) over
a wide range of potentials. This potential-dependent study gives independent
assessment of the position of the point of zero charge.43 More recently, Uhl et al. elucidated the adsorption
of [EMIm]+[TFSA]− and [OMIm]+[TFSA]− at Au(111). Again, they identified the
formation of an adlayer on the surface and the influence of cation
and anion upon adsorption.44 Tamura and
Nishihata used X-ray scattering to study the behavior of halide ions
on the ILs@Au(111) electrode, where IL = 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium
([BMP]+[TFSA]−) and ([BMIm]+[TFSA]−). They concluded that the adsorption of
[BMP]+[TFSA]− and [BMIm]+[TFSA]− is stronger than that of the halide ions. They revealed
also that the interfacial structure is influenced not only by the
concentration of ILs but also by the nature of the anions and cations
in the composition of the ILs.45 In brief,
these investigations established that the adsorption of anions and
cations at the gold surface can significantly affect the chemical
reactivity of the electrode.46

At
the molecular level, more light can be shed onto the adsorption
mechanism, reactivity, and the ordering of various ILs at metal surfaces
using quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics with the
help of force-field-based simulations. Indeed, recent advances in
molecular modeling showed that these techniques represent a valuable
tool to predict the nanoscale properties and reactivity at these material
interfaces and the adsorption mechanism and physical properties of
ILs at 2D surfaces.47 For instance, Mendonca
et al. reported the ordering of ILs@Fe surface using density-functional-based
force-field calculations to study the effect of the adsorption of
short- and long-chain alkyl groups in ILs. Moreover, their molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that both the anion and the cation
of the ILs are adsorbed on the Fe surface and that the oxygen atom
of the sulfonyl group is particularly strongly bonded with the metal.
They also found that the interfacial layer is composed of a unique
layer except for the very short chain alkyl groups where a second
layer is formed. Different behaviors are noticed for butyl chains
of the sulfonate anions (which tend to be directed away from the surface)
and ammonium cations (lying more parallel to the surface).48 Later on, Heinz and co-workers reported facet
recognition and molecular ordering of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
ethyl sulfate ([EMIm]+[ES]−) on the Au(111),
Au(100), and Au(110) surfaces employing quantum mechanical and classical
simulation approaches. They identified self-assembly of ILs@gold surfaces
from single ion pairs to multilayers. They showed that adsorption
is controlled by the interplay of soft epitaxy, ionic interactions,
induced charges, and steric effects related to the geometry of the
cation and the anion.49 These findings
are also observed for ILs in Au nanopores. Indeed, orientation and
confined effects of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate
([BMIm]+[PF6]−) IL at Au nanopores
were pointed out after MD simulations by Liu et al.50 Their study stated also that the Im ring of [BMIm]+ prefers to form a small tilt angle with the pore walls and
that the dynamics of confined ILs is remarkably slower than that observed
in the bulk phase. Nevertheless, there is evident lack of understanding,
at the microscopic level, the charge transfer mechanisms and the adsorption
sites on surfaces. This may be connected to the fact that pure first-principles
investigations of ILs on metals and more specifically on gold surfaces
are rare in contrast to the large number of experimental studies.
We can cite for instance the work of Ploger et al. who used the periodic
density functional theory (DFT) approach to elucidate the coverage
of the surface of Au(100) by [BMIm]+[PF6]− and their respective orientation with a wide range
of coverage.51

Beattie et al.52 reported the adsorption
behavior of 0.1% 1-[HMIm]+[NTf2]−; (NTF2 also called TFSA), in ethanol solutions, onto
the gold surface using XPS and spectroscopic ellipsometry methods.
They found that both anions and cations are present in the surface-bound
layer and also that the adsorbed layer thickness (of ∼1.5 Å)
is smaller than the size of an IL ion pair. Very recently, the same
group studied [HMIm]+ with [NTf2]− and [Cl]− anions on silver (Ag) using synchrotron-based
XPS spectroscopy. They showed that there is no chemical interaction
between the [HMIm]+[NTf2]− pair and Ag, whereas a chemical interaction exists in the case of
[HMIm]+[Cl]− with Ag where a chemisorbed
[HMIm]+[Cl]− is identified (i.e., Ag–Cl
bond).53 These studies clearly reveal that
there is no clear evidence to understand the adsorption mechanism
of ILs on surfaces and the nature of bonding between them. The framework
of the present study will thus give valuable complementary information
to understand the uncovered mechanism at the molecular level with
different BMIm-based ILs. Indeed, we have modeled ionic liquid electrolytes
in interaction with the Au(111) surface to mimic the electrode–electrolyte
interface using first-principles computation approaches. We have selected
both hydrophilic (i.e., [BMIm]+ with [Cl]−, [DCA]−, and [HCOO]−) and hydrophobic
(i.e., [BMIm]+[X]−, where X = BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, OTF, and TFSA)
ionic liquids. First, we treated these ILs in gas phase. Then, we
considered ILs@Au(111) to shed light on the adsorption mechanism,
structural orientation, and bonding of ILs on the gold surface. We
found that gold surface and IL interactions are mainly dominated by
electrostatics and vdWs type of forces. Thus, the inclusion of dispersion
correction (DFT-D3) is important to describe and understand the dispersive
role during the molecular adsorption at the solid–liquid interface.
We also show that three different modes of attractions are possible
during the adsorption: (i) anion-induced cation adsorption on the
hydrophilic ILs@Au(111) surface, (ii) stabilization of cation through
long-range dispersive interactions, followed by adsorption of the
anion interacting with the cation in hydrophobic ILs, and (iii) adsorption
of the alkyl group depending on the nature of anion and ion-pair interactions.
These findings will be established and discussed in this article.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Equilibrium Geometries
and Energetics of Ionic
liquids (ILs) in Gas Phase
We considered both hydrophobic
and hydrophilic ionic liquids. These ILs are composed of the [BMIm]+ cation with various X– anions (where X
= Cl, (CN)2N (DCA), HCOO, BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, CF3SO3 (OTF),
and (CF3SO2)N (TFSA or NTf2)). They
are denoted [BMIm]+[X]−. All of these
ILs are hydrophobic, except for X = Cl, DCA, and HCOO. Figure 1 shows the optimized geometries
of all of these ILs as computed at the PBE/6-311++G** level of theory.
As can be seen in this figure, all anions interact through hydrogen
bond (H-bond) with the carbon atom present between two N atoms of
the imidazole (Im) subunit of BMIm+ (i.e., C2 position in the ring). Indeed, we identified these C2–H···Cl, C2–H···N,
C2–H···O, C2–H···F,
and C2–H···O H-bonds for the complexes
involving the Cl–, DCA–, HCOO–, BF4–, and TFSA– anions, respectively. It is interesting to note that OTF– forms a three-centered H-bond with the C2–H group.

Figure 1 Optimized
structures of ILs computed at the PBE/6-311++G** level
along with the cation–anion distances (in Å) and angles
(in degree).

Table 1 lists the
interionic distances, defined here by the H-bond involving the carbon
at the C2 position, and the basis set superposition error
(BSSE)-corrected binding energies (BEs) of [BMIm]+[X]− as computed at the PBE/6-311++G** level. The calculated
distances vary in the range 1.57–2.27 Å. The shortest
one is observed between [BMIm]+ and [HCOO]− species. For BEs, we computed values in the −77.2 to −101.7
kcal/mol energy range. These values are relatively large because of
the ionic nature of the bonding within ILs. This is due to the formation
of double H-bonds between the anions and the [BMIm]+ cation.
The largest BE is for [BMIm]+[HCOO]− in
accordance with the shortest intermonomer distance computed for this
IL. The weakest interaction energies are observed for [BMIm]+ interacting with [PF6–] and [TFSA–] ILs. This is due to the highly hydrophobic nature
of the perfluoro moiety that may reduce the electrostatic interactions.
In Table 1, we provide
also the BSSE-corrected BEs including dispersion correction (i.e.,
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE)+D3). This table shows that the
contribution of D3 correction to BEs is not negligible and amounts
to ∼2–6 kcal/mol. The D3-corrected BEs are larger (in
absolute value).

2.2 ILs@Au(111) Surface
2.2.1 Hydrophilic
IL Adsorption on the Au(111)
Surface
To study the nature of interactions between the gold
surface and ILs, we performed periodic computations. First, the optimized
gas-phase geometries of [BMIm]+[X]− (where
X = Cl, DCA, and HCOO) ILs were used as the starting point for these
computations. Dispersion correction terms have been incorporated during
the bulk phase optimization. The bulk-phase geometries of Au(111)
and hydrophilic ILs are shown in Figure 2 along with the important distances. This
figure shows that the [BMIm]+ cation has its imidazole
ring parallel to the surface, where distances of ∼3.577–3.723
Å are computed between the imidazole entity and gold surface.
These distances are in good agreement with vdWs type of interactions
between these hydrophilic ILs and the Au(111) surface via the π–π
stacking prototype model. In addition, we observe anchor-assisted
H-bonds between the alkyl chain and Au atom (Calkyl–H···Au(s))
as those found for imidazole attached to Aun clusters.
Indeed, we previously established that these anchor-assisted H-bonds
significantly enhance the stability of such complexes.54Figure 2 shows also that the Cl– and DCA– anions are strongly bonded with the Au surface where they form bonds
with Au atoms except the HCOO– anion. After the
adsorption of ILs at the gold surface, the ion-pair interactions are
disrupted because of the covalent and noncovalent interactions of
ions with the surface. Particularly, Cl– adsorbs
on a bridge site of the Au surface, whereas DCA– is bonded with Au on the top site via the nitrogen atoms, where
the HCOO– anion is simultaneously interacting with
the surface and the cation through H-bond (i.e., C2–H).
The calculated ion-pair H-bond distances show that there is a strong
interaction of HCOO– (1.759 Å) and DCA– (1.946 Å) anions at the interface, whereas the
same distance for [BMIm]+[Cl]− is distinctly
longer (2.562 Å) because of the formation of the Au–Cl
bond at a perfect site in the interface. The significant changes in
the ion pairs may happen from the bond formation between the Au(111)
surface with Cl– and N(DCA)– anions.
The interaction strength can be calculated from the calculated adsorption
energies.

Figure 2 Optimized geometrical structures, as computed at the PBE+D3/TZVP
level of theory, of various hydrophilic ILs@Au(111) surfaces and nearest
interacting distances (in Å) between ILs and the Au(111) surface.
In bottom, we show the top (t), bridge (b), and hexagonal close-packed
(hcp) hollow (h) sites of the different adsorption sites of [BMIm]+[Cl]− on the Au(111) surface.

Table 2 gives the
adsorption energies (Eads) of these ILs
on Au(111) using the TZVP basis set. As can be seen, there are large
deviations between the Eads values computed
with and without inclusion of dispersion corrections, where ILs are
optimized at the respective level of theory. This clearly reveals
that the dispersion interaction plays a crucial role in the adsorption
of these ILs on the Au(111) surface. Because of the vdWs type of interaction
in these adsorptions, the PBE+D3 Eads values
are clearly viewed to be more accurate, and in the following, we will
refer to this set of data.

a The PBE+D3 computations
were done
using the PBE/TZVP optimized geometry. Dgp and Dads (in Å) are the intermonomer
distances between the anion and the cation for [BMIm]+···[X]− in gas phase and when the same moiety is adsorbed
at the Au(111) surface, respectively.

b Eads calculated from PBE+D3/TZVP
geometries for the TZV2P basis set (consider
only for IL).

We computed
two slightly different Au–Cl distances (of ∼2.64
and 2.62 Å) for [BMIm]+[Cl]−@Au(111)
(Figure 2). For [BMIm]+[DCA]−@Au(111), a shorter Au–N distance
of 2.237 Å is obtained, the other Au–N distances being
slightly longer. The corresponding Eads values of these hydrophilic ILs are −81.78 and −78.06
kcal/mol for Cl and DCA, respectively (Table 2). The calculated Eads at TZV2P (using TZVP geometry) for the same ILs are −71.23
and −70.62 kcal/mol, respectively, that is, around 10 kcal/mol
smaller. It is found that the DFT+D3 BE of [BMIm]+[HCOO]− at the surface is very low when compared to that of
other hydrophilic ILs, the BE is ∼−22 kcal/mol using
the PBE+D3/TZV2P method. This clearly reveals that the binding strength
of ILs depends on the nature of the anion and binding mode of ILs,
either dispersive or covalent bond.

2.2.2 Hydrophobic
IL Adsorption on the Au(111)
Surface
Figure 3 shows the optimized structures of various hydrophobic ILs on Au(111)
along with some respective interacting distances. We considered [BMIm]+[X]− ILs, where X = BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, OTF, and TFSA. This figure
shows that [BMIm]+ mostly lies parallel to the gold surface
and is stabilized by π–π stacking interactions
except for [BMIm]+[TFSA]−. Indeed, [BMIm]+[TFSA]− exhibits a strong interaction between
perfluoro derivatives of the TFSA anion and the C2 position
of [BMIm]+ through H-bond (∼2.1 Å). Moreover,
our computations show that the alkyl group of the cation is adsorbed
on the Au surface except PF6− and CH3SO3−. The calculated distances
between the Au(111) surface and the center of the [BMIm]+ cation are in the ∼3.56–3.80 Å range. In addition
to above-mentioned interactions, anchor-assisted H-bonds also stabilize
the hydrophobic ILs at the Au(111) surface. The calculated Calkyl–H···Au interacting distances vary from ∼2.8
to 3.2 Å, depending on the anion.

Figure 3 Optimized equilibrium
structures, as computed at the PBE+D3/TZVP
level of theory, of various hydrophobic ILs on the Au(111) surface.
We give also the nearest interacting distances (in Å) and angles
(in degree) between ILs and the Au(111) surface.

In contrast to the case of [BMIm]+[X]− (where X = Cl, DCA) hydrophobic ILs, Figure 3 shows that the interaction of the Au(111)
surface occurs only with the [BMIm]+ cation because no
bonding is observed between the anions and gold atoms. Instead, these
hydrophobic anions form a complex with the adsorbed [BMIm]+ cation, i.e., localized above the cation entity. The H-bonding distances
between the anion and the cation within these ILs vary from ∼1.759
to 2.267 Å after the adsorption.

Table 2 provides
the calculated adsorption energies (Eads) of hydrophobic ILs with and without considering dispersion correction.
This table shows that the Eads values
of these ILs as computed with the PBE/TZVP method are wrongly positive,
contrary to those of the hydrophilic ILs. Instead, negative Eads values are computed when the D3 correction
is included. This is due to the dispersive interaction, which dominates
the [BMIm]+ and Au(111) surface interaction. This observation
is in line with the experimental studies of ILs at Au(111) surfaces
by in situ STM.42

Even though the
same cation is considered in these hydrophobic
ILs, different Eads values are computed.
At the DFT+D3 level, we estimate Eads values
of −46.57, −41.49, −8.41, −40.98, and
−28.58 kcal/mol for [BMIm]+[X]−, where X is PF6, BF4, CH3SO3, OTF (CF3SO3), and TFSA ((CF3SO2)2N), respectively (Table 2). These Eads values are distinctly lower (by at least 50%) from those derived
for [BMIm]+[Cl]−@Au(111) and for [BMIm]+[DCA]−@Au(111).

To elucidate the role
of the anion in the Au(111)–[BMIm]+ interaction,
we list in Table 3 the
adsorption energies of the [BMIm]+ cation
alone with respect to the anion. These adsorption energies are computed
using the following formula 1  where EBMIm@Au(111), EAu(111), and EBMIm energies were obtained from single point computations
at the PBE(+D3)/TZVP optimized geometries.

DCA– anions were adsorbed on the Au(111) surface.
The other anions were adsorbed on the cation and not on the Au(111)
surface.

b N-R1 represents the methyl.

c N-R2 represents the butyl
group in [BMIm]+.

The calculated energies reveal that the cationic adsorption significantly
dominates over that of the anion because these energies are as large
as −94.0 to −106.0 kcal/mol, i.e., at least twice of
those given in Table 2 for the hydrophobic ILs. Moreover, this table shows that there are
three different ranges of Eads due to
alkyl group adsorption on the Au(111) surface. Indeed, the contribution
of the alkyl group is significant enough to alter the stability of
the ILs on surface binding. This depends on the number of CH2 subunits adsorbed on the Au(111) surface.

phases reveals that there are slight structural changes of IL subunits
upon adsorption at the Au(111) surface. However, the intermonomer
distances between the anion and the cation are changed. Indeed, the
intermonomer distances between the anion and the cation significantly
deviate from the gas phase to the solid surface interface for the
hydrophilic ILs (Cl, DCA, and HCOO) and some hydrophobic ILs (OTF
and TFSA), as shown in Table 2. The large deviations in hydrophilic IL interactions are
mainly due to the covalent bond formation between the anion and the
surface. Thus, these effects may affect the electrostatic behavior
of ILs at the gold surface, which favors the charge transfer process.

The stability depends on the nature of the adsorption sites of
the anion, cation, and alkyl groups and on the charge transfer phenomena
between these complexes. The adsorption behavior of the eight different
ILs and their electron density profiles on the Au(111) surface are
shown in Figures 4 and 5. The cationic part of IL interacts through the
Au(111) surface via vdWs interactions from the [BMIm]+ cation
and anchor-assisted H-bond from its alkyl group, whereas for anions,
the interaction depends on their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character.
Both hydrophilic anions are here directly bonded with the top or bridge
site of the Au(111) surface. Previously, we have reported that for
Im@Au(111) the interaction sites of Im with Au(111) may reflect the
bonding nature of the complex.55 Indeed,
we found that N(Im) strongly binds with the top site of the Au(111)
surface. Similarly, we found that there are different sites on Au(111)
available for binding, and respective binding sites are provided in Table 3 for all ILs@Au(111).
The selective adsorption sites of cation–anion are shown in Figure 2. To predict the
effect of the anion on the binding character, we have also calculated Eads for [BMIm]+ at the Au(111) surface
for various anions optimized as given by eq 1. Here, we found that anions play a vital
role in the selective adsorption, site selectivity, and reactivity
with the surface. This will be reflected in the BEs of the complexes.

Table 3 shows the
specific adsorption sites of ILs at the gold surface. This table reveals
that the cation (N atoms) is mostly attracted by the bridge site except
[BMIm]+ with [BF4]− (top)
and [HCOO]− (hcp), whereas anions are attracted
by different sites, depending on the size of the anion. For example,
hydrophilic ILs, with [Cl]− and [DCA]− anions, adsorb at the bridge (b) and top (t) sites, respectively.
These anions are not interacting at the hcp (h) site. The respective
N atoms in the cation for Cl interacts with (h, b) and DCA in (b,
b) sites. The other mode of interaction at the interface concerns
alkyl chain adsorption on the Au surface. There are three different
kinds of interactions, that is, C–H···Au, CH2···Au, and CH3···Au.
All of these interactions increase Eads and also affect the local charge density. This will enhance the
charge transfer process at electrode–electrolyte interfacial
sites.

2.3 Charge Transfer, Electron
Density and Molecular
Orbital Analyses
Adsorption and desorption mechanisms play
a vital role in the charge transfer phenomenon of the electrode–electrolyte
interface materials, as shown by numerous experimental and theoretical
studies.56−59 Indeed, the nature of ILs is of great importance in the charge transfer
process through the electrochemical window.56,57 These reports state that the adsorption mechanism of anions and
cations on a metal surface is essential to understand the charge transfer
mechanism and specific adsorption sites. For instance, most of previous
works varied the potential ranges, which cause the orientation of
the ILs at the charged surfaces, observed by STM and atomic force
microscopy (AFM), followed by the formation of EDL of ILs adsorbed
at solid surfaces.58 The in situ STM study
of a potential-dependent surface showed restructuring and electrochemical
annealing of the Au(111) electrode in the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
tetrafluoroborate [BMIm-BF4] ionic liquid. Also, this work
found that the long-range surface restructuring phenomenon is observed
because of the partial charge transfer to the weakly adsorbed [BMIm]+ and synergetic effect of the counter anion BF4–, which reduces the metal–metal cohesive
energy.59

In the present work, we
identified relatively strong interactions between [BMIm]+ and the Au(111) surface. Thus, the electrostatic surface defects
may be enhanced and can easily attract hydrophilic anions through
charge transfer phenomena. Consequently, ILs form an adlayer on the
Au(111) surface as observed in the recent in situ STM studies of ILs
at the Au(111) surface.40 These interactions
induce charge transfer processes between the gold electrode surface
and ILs, which are of great importance for the electrochemical applications
discussed above. Moreover, such an environment can affect the reactivity
of the gold surface.

We have performed electron density analysis
(EDA) for a Au(111)
neutral surface model. For instance, we performed EDA by using the
Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) exchange–correlation functional
as implemented in the C2PK code. The effects of core electrons and
nuclei were treated with Geodecker–Teter–Hutter (GTH)
pseudopotentials. For representing all valance electrons, we used
the cutoff value 400 Ry and set triple-ζ double-polarized basis
sets. We have generated a cube density file from the optimized coordinates
(at PBE+D3/TZVP) to study the charge distribution on the surface and
ILs. Moreover, we used optimized coordinates to perform the energy
calculations. The EDA pictures of adsorption of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
ILs on the gold surface are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The red isosurface represents the
positive charge accumulation, and light yellow and blue end shows
the negative charge accumulations on the atoms at the surface. The
adsorption of [BMIm]+[Cl]− on the Au(111)
surface was confirmed by the electron density picture. The red color
of ILs shows the positive charge on the imidazolium nitrogen and the
Cl atom adsorbed on the gold surface. The green and light yellow color
indicates the neutral charge accumulations of the alkyl chain and
methyl groups connected to the imidazolium rings, respectively.

hydrophilic ILs@Au(111) surfaces.

Figure 5 Electron density surface (left: isosurface value of 0.001 au; right:
mapped sphere for 0.001 au) of various hydrophobic ILs@Au(111) surfaces.

Table 3 shows the
selective adsorption sites of various anions containing [BMIm]+ ILs, and corresponding Eads values
with respect to different anions are shown in Figure 6. Our study clearly reveals that whenever
[BMIm]+ adsorbs at the bridge site the calculated Eads is smaller when compared to Eads for top and hcp adsorption sites. It is interesting
to note that [BMIm]+ of HCOO− and BF4− anions were strongly adsorbed when compare
to the other anions. This reveals that the N-based moiety prefers
to stay at the top/hcp sites of the gold surface. An earlier report
on Im@Au(111) revealed that N(Im) always prefers to interact with
the top site of the gold surface.55 This
is also confirmed by the analysis of the electron density of [BMIm]+ adsorbed on Au(111) (Figure 4). Indeed, this figure shows that the bridge site selectivity
dominates over that for the other sites. The density pictures of adsorption
of all ILs exhibit the same features except for ILs containing BF4− and HCOO− anions. The
spin density plot of [BMIm]+[Cl]− at
the gas and solid–liquid interface is shown in Figure 7. This confirms the charge
distribution of anions and cations at the gold surface, which favors
the electrostatic behavior.

and solid–liquid interface. The blue and red colors represent
the positive and negative spin densities, respectively.

Table 4 provides
the Mulliken, Hirshfeld, and Löwdin charge analyses of gas-phase
ILs of interest in the present study and ILs adsorbed at the Au(111)
surface. This table shows that all three analyses provide the same
trend evolution for the charge transfer from the gas phase into the
solid–liquid interface. However, Löwdin charges significantly
enhance the electrostatic behavior compared with the other two methods.
Indeed, the computed potential difference values between [BMIm]+[Cl]− and the Au(111) surface using Mulliken,
Hirshfeld, and Löwdin approaches are ∼0.62, ∼1.02,
and ∼2.11 au, respectively. This enhancement is related to
the nature of interactions between ILs and the interface. Indeed,
anions weakly adsorbed at the surface exhibit fewer enhancements,
whereas covalently bonded anions have the opposite behavior. For instance,
DCA– presents the same behavior as that of Cl– and the HCOO anion does not.

In the following discussions, we will use Löwdin
charges
(shown in bold characters in Table 4). The comparison of partial charges of the IL ion
pairs in the gas phase and at the solid–liquid interface shows
that there is a significant enhancement in the partial atomic charge
on the ion pair upon adsorption. For hydrophilic ILs on the gold surface,
the atomic charges are, for instance, 3 times larger than those in
the gas phase (except for the HCOO anion). For hydrophobic ILs, charges
are varied from ∼1.5 to 2 times. These changes are very significant
and modify the reactivity of the surface at the microscopic scale.
They can promote the charge transfer in the Au(111)–IL composite
and the binding strength of ILs at this interface through various
covalent and noncovalent interactions such as vdWs, electrostatic,
and dipole-induced dipole interactions. We found that there is a significant
charge transfer between the gold surface and hydrophilic ILs at this
interface. Indeed, one can see a relatively large positive charge
localized on Cl− and N(DCA)− in
the Löwdin scheme after adsorption of Cl− and DCA− on the Au(111) surface. The calculated
partial charges for these two anions at the gold surface are 2.11
and 1.82 au, respectively.

It is interesting to note that after
adsorption of ILs at Au(111)
the Au surface potential becomes negative for all complexes and particularly
charge transfer is significant in hydrophilic ILs. The respective
partial charges on the Au surface are as follows: for Cl, −2.11;
for DCA, −1.82; for HCOO, −0.16; for BF4,
−0.56; for PF6, −0.52; for CH3SO3, −0.50; for OTF, −0.66; and for TFSA,
−0.34. The HCOO anion-containing gold surface has very less
negative charges than those of the surfaces with the other anions.
This is due to the strong electrostatic interaction between IL ion
pairs and the Au(111) surface. For instance, the adsorbed cation can
induce stronger binding of the cation compared with the anion. This
unusual effect can significantly enhance the Coulombic electrostatic
interaction between ILs and the surface. Note that AFM studies on
ILs at the Au(111) surface revealed a similar effect with EDL formation
at the electrode–electrolyte interface.23 For the [BMIm]+[X]−@Au(111)
surface, the order of magnitude of the distribution of charge observed
at the gold surface is Cl− > DCA− > OTF− > BF4− > PF6− > CH3SO3− > TFSA− > HCOO−. This
may provide an explanation for the nature of the interactions and
of the adsorption sites. Therefore, the charge transfer process can
be influenced and guide the IL interaction with the Au surface. Thus,
our study should be helpful to select the suitable composite material
for the energy storage and electrochemical applications.

3 Conclusions
The adsorption of hydrophilic and hydrophobic
ILs such as [BMIm]+[X]− [where X = Cl,
DCA, HCOO, BF4, PF6, CH3SO3, OTF, and TFSA] on
the Au(111) surface is studied by DFT-based PBE and PBE+D3 methods.
Our study clearly reveals that dispersive interaction plays a dominant
role in the stability of the ILs@Au(111) surface, which is confirmed
by our DFT+D3 approach. It is found from our calculations that there
are several modes of attractions possible during the adsorption: (i)
anion-induced cation adsorption on the hydrophilic ILs@Au(111) surface,
(ii) whereas in the hydrophobic case, the cation first stabilizes
through long-range dispersive interaction, followed by adsorption
of the anion and (iii) adsorption of the alkyl group depending on
the nature of the anion and ion-pair interactions. Thus, hydrophilic
anions of ILs tightly adsorbed on the gold surface through covalent
bonds in addition to this, anions and cations were stabilized through
H-bonded interactions. These three different kinds of adsorption are
also reflected in the Eads. In addition,
our work shows that adsorption of the alkyl chain of [BMIm]+ on the gold surface can enhance the stability and charge transfer
process through anchor-assisted H-bond except in the case of the [BMIm]+ cation with [PF6]− and [CH3SO3]− anions. Our studies reveal
that the unusual effect of surface charges can induce the electrostatic
interaction between the ion pair and Au(111) surface.

The present
investigations of the structure and dynamics of various
ILs at the Au(111) surface can be helpful to understand the adsorption
mechanism at the microscopic level and charge transfer between electrode
and electrolyte materials for energy harvesting and catalysis applications.
Our studies should also be useful for the selection of ILs at the
solid–liquid interface for energy storage applications.

4 Computational Details
In this work, we performed computations
of isolated ILs and of
ILs in interaction with the gold surface. These electronic structure
computations are carried out using Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof
(PBE) generalized gradient approximation density functional theory
(DFT) to treat exchange–correlation60 with and without considering Grimme’s latest version of empirical
correction term (DFT-D3) to study the effect of dispersion correction.61−63 Indeed, dispersion correction should help in properly describing
the interaction in solid–liquid and solid–gas interface
systems, especially for composite materials composed of organic molecules
and metal surfaces.55

For ILs, computations
consisted of geometry optimizations without
constraints at the PBE(+D3) level, followed by frequency calculations
to confirm the minimum nature of the conformations. All electronic
structure calculations were performed using the GAUSSIAN 16 and GaussView
6.0 software packages.64 The atoms were
described with the 6-311++G** basis set.65 The binding energies (BEs) of the IL complexes are calculated within
the supramolecular approach and corrected for the basis set superposition
error (BSSE) employing the counterpoise (CP) procedure of Boys and
Bernardi66 2  where EIL, Eanion, and Ecation are the total energies of the IL, anion, and cation
as computed
in the full basis set of the IL complex.

For the computations
of ILs interacting with the gold surface,
we used the CP2K/Quickstep code with periodic DFT calculations.67 A hybrid basis set formalism known as a Gaussian
and Plane Wave68 (GPW) is implemented in
CP2K, where the Kohn–Sham orbitals are expanded in terms of
contracted Gaussian type orbitals, whereas an auxiliary plane wave
basis set is used to expand the electronic charge density. Indeed,
valence electron density and pseudopotentials are expressed by a mixed
GPW basis set scheme.69 All atoms, except
Au, were represented by the optimized MOLOPT-TZVP basis set,70 whereas we used the DZVP-MOLOPT-SR-GTH (SR denotes
a shorter range) basis set for Au atoms. A plane wave cutoff (of 400
Ry) was included. Orbital transformation was also used to reduce the
total ground-state energy.71 In this study,
atomic structures of the Au(111) surface were taken from previously
resolved global minimum structures on the basis of combined photoelectron
spectroscopy measurements.72 The slab consisted
of three layers (each has 48 Au atoms). We fixed only the bottom layer,
and the upper two layers were optimized freely throughout the study.
Afterward, we optimized the structure of the IL@Au(111) composite
material. The adsorption energies (Eads) of ILs on the Au surface (Eads(IL@Au(111)))
were evaluated using the following equation 3  where EIL@Au(111), EAu(111), and EIL are the total
energies of IL@Au(111), Au(111) surface, and
IL, respectively. We have also generated a cube density file from
the optimized coordinates (at PBE+D3/TZVP) to study the charge distribution
on the surface with ILs.
