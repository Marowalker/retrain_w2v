Expanding the application
range of flame-retardant polymer biocomposites
remains a huge challenge for a sustainable society. Despite largely
enhanced flame retardancy, until now the resultant poly(lactic acid)
(PLA) composites still suffer reduced tensile strength and impact
toughness due to improper material design strategies. We, herein,
demonstrate the design of a green flame retardant additive (ammonium
polyphosphate (APP)@cellulose nanofiber (CNF)) via using the cellulose
nanofibers (CNFs) as the green multifunctional additives hybridized
with ammonium polyphosphate (APP). The results show that PLA composite
with 5 wt % loading of APP@CNF can pass the UL-94 V-0 rating, besides
a high limited oxygen index of 27.5%, indicative of a significantly
enhanced flame retardancy. Moreover, the 5 wt % of APP@CNF enables
the impact strength (σi) of the PVA matrix to significantly
improve from 7.63 to 11.8 kJ/m2 (increase by 54%), in addition
to a high tensile strength of 50.3 MPa for the resultant flame-retardant
PLA composite. The enhanced flame retardancy and mechanical strength
performances are attributed to the improved dispersion of APP@CNF
and its smaller phase size within the PLA matrix along with their
synergistic effect between APP and CNF. This work opens up a facile
innovative methodology for the design of high-performance ecofriendly
flame retardants and their advanced polymeric composites.

1 Introduction
Nowadays, petrochemical
polymeric materials are under tremendous
impact due to the depletion of fossil resources and the sustainable
development of our society.1,2 Currently, poly(lactic
acid) (PLA) is considered as one of the most promising renewable biomass
material with excellent mechanical properties, biodegradability, transparency,
and so on.3−5 These attractive properties allow PLA to find growing
application potentials in packaging, electric and electronic, automotive,
textiles, and transportation. However, the intrinsic flammability
of PLA, which has a low limited oxygen index (LOI) of only 19%, extremely
restricts its applications in the above fields. Therefore, it is highly
urgent to endow PLA with desired flame retardancy to meet the fire-retardant
requirement. Especially a UL-94 V-0 level during fire is required
in electric industrial applications.6−9

Tremendous efforts have been made
to improve the flame retardancy
of PLA to date. Among the current flame retardancy approaches, inorganic
phosphorus-containing intumescent flame retardants have been identified
as a promising approach because of relatively high efficiency, low
smoke, and low toxicity.10−13 However, currently the flame-retardant PLA composites
normally show reduced mechanical properties relative to the PLA bulk.
For example, Song et al. incorporated a combination of ammonium polyphosphate
(APP)/poly(ethylene glycol) 6000 into PLA, and the addition of 7 wt
% of this combined system can make PLA pass a V-0 rating. Unfortunately,
the tensile strength significantly decreases in spite of largely increased
strain at break.8 Recently, Zhao et al.
have synthesized one superefficient flame retardant N,N’-diallyl-P-phenylphosphonicdiamide (P-AA),
and only adding 1.0 wt % P-AA enables PLA to pass the UL-94 V-0 rating
without compromising the tensile strength of PLA.14 However, the ductility of PLA is reduced to a certain degree
probably due to the cross-link action between P-AA and PLA.14 Therefore, a lot of efforts are focused on designing
a new type of flame retardant or introducing a reinforcement component
for improving the mechanical properties of the flame-retardant PLA
composites.15−17 A typical example is that the direct use of nanofibrous
cellulose (NFC) or modified NFC in the APP-flame-retarded PLA composites
significantly decreases the mechanical strength of the PLA composites
due to the negative dispersion in PLA and poor interfacial adhesion.15

Meanwhile, the effect of rodlike aluminated
mesoporous silica (Al-SBA)
on the flame retardancy of PLA was investigated by Qian et al.16 The results show that PLA composite with 0.5
wt % Al-SBA can get a V-0 rating during UL-94 tests and basically
maintain the tensile strength of the PLA. We have recently designed
a novel core–shell flame-retardant system by chemically grafting
the phosphorus–nitrogen-based polymer on the surface of cellulose
nanofiber (CNF). Specifically, adding 10 wt % of this flame retardant
enables PLA composite to achieve a UL-94 V-0 rating and show a significantly
reduced peak heat release rate (pHRR), indicating a good flame retardancy.
Unexpectedly, the tensile strength of the PLA composite increases
by about 24% as compared with that of the PLA matrix.17 Despite that, currently the preparation of these synthesized
flame-retardant systems is normally not cost-effective and ecofriendly,
for instance, the toxic solvents or raw materials are involved in
some cases. Therefore, it remains a major challenge to design high-performance
flame retardants by using facile material design strategies.

Because of its exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness,18−20 one-dimensional CNF can act as a reinforcing agent for the flame-retardant
polymer composites and also for the char layer during the combustion
of the material.17 In addition, it can
also serve as the surface modifier for the flame retardant, APP. Therefore,
we herein have demonstrated the facile preparation of a new hybridized
flame-retardant system (APP@CNF) through facilely ball-milling mixing
APP and CNF in water by using CNF as the surface modifier and the
synergistic agent for APP. The results show that the presence of CNF
improves the dispersion of APP within the PLA matrix, and a loading
level as low as 5 wt % of APP@CNF enables PLA to pass a V-0 rating
in addition to a LOI of 27.5%. Moreover, 5 wt % of APP@CNF enables
the impact strength (σi) for the PVA matrix to improve
from 7.63 to 11.8 kJ/m2 (increase by 54%), besides a high
tensile strength of 50.3 MPa for the resultant PLA composite. This
work offers a facile ecofriendly methodology to create high-performance
green flame-retardant additives and their advanced polymer composites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of APP@CNF
Fourier
transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra of APP, CNF, and APP@CNF are performed
to characterize their chemical structure and hydrogen-bond (H-bond)
interactions. As shown in Figure 1b, the pure APP shows several characteristic absorption
peaks. The absorption band at 3226 cm–1 is attributed
to the stretching vibration of N–H groups and the peak around
1254 cm–1 is assigned to the P=O stretching
vibration. The peaks at 1086 and 883 cm–1 belong
to the asymmetric stretching vibration of P–O.21 In the case of pure CNF, these are typical characteristic
absorption peaks of CNF, such as 3436 cm–1 (νO–H), 1185 cm–1 (νC–H), 1094 cm–1 (ν–O–), 1044 cm–1 (νC–O).17 The spectrum of APP@CNF basically shows the
characteristic absorption peaks of both APP and CNF. Moreover, compared
to APP and CNF, several new absorption bands appear at 3127, 3242,
and 3240 cm–1, belonging to the stretching vibration
of bonded N–H and O–H groups between APP and CNF. In
addition, the stretching vibration of P=O of APP shows a blueshift
from 1254 to 1296 cm–1, indicating strong H-bond
interactions between O–H groups on the CNF surface and P=O
in APP. This is reasonable that abundant hydroxyl groups on the CNF
surface can strongly interact with both N–H and P=O
groups in APP via the formation of H-bonds.22,23 To examine the phase size of APP@CNF and APP within the PLA matrix,
the weight-average particle size distribution of 20 wt % APP and 10
wt % APP@CNF within the PLA composite are analyzed (Figure 1c,d). Unexpectedly, APP@CNF
shows a statistical weight-average diameter (dw) of 0.5–1.0 μm except for some big phases, which
is much smaller than dw (2–10 μm)
of APP in the PLA matrix. This is because the presence of CNF during
the ball-milling process helps reduce the phase size of APP by acting
as a surface modifier.

design
and fabrication process for both APP@CNF and its PLA composite. (b)

size (dw) distribution of (c) 20% APP
and (d) 10% APP@CNF within the PLA matrix.

2.2 Dispersion of APP@CNF
The surface
morphology and dispersion of APP, CNF, APP@CNF, and PLA composites
are visually observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and
scanning electron microscopy (SEM). As displayed in Figure 2a, many APP agglomerates (marked
by red arrows) appear in the PLA/20APP composite because the great
polarity difference between APP and PLA makes them thermodynamically
incompatible. Similarly, the CNF also exists basically in the form
of agglomeration in the PLA matrix (see Figure 2b) due to the strong polarity of the CNF.
In comparison, APP@CNF can homogeneously disperse within the PLA matrix
and no obvious interfaces can be recognized between APP@CNF and the
polymer matrix, as presented in Figure 2c,e. At a high magnification, the individual CNF (marked
by the green arrow) and nanoscale APP (marked by red arrow) can be
identified. Furthermore, as seen clearly in Figure 2c,d, the CNF phase locates around the APP
surface by acting as surface modifier. This interesting phenomenon
indicates that through hybridization, the CNF enables APP to well
disperse in the PLA matrix by acting as the interfacial adhesion agent
between PLA and APP. Figure 2f gives a schematic illustration of the dispersion and interactions
of both CNF and APP within the PLA matrix.

dispersion of both APP and CNF within PLA host, as well as their interactions.

2.3 Thermal
Properties
Figure 3 presents the thermogrametric
analysis (TGA) curves of PLA and its composites based on APP, CNF,
and APP@CNF under nitrogen and air conditions. In nitrogen, the pristine
PLA shows a relatively high thermal stability with an initial degradation
temperature (Ti) of 338 °C, and holds
only a small amount of 1.23 wt % char residue at 600 °C. PLA/5CNF
begins to degrade at 339 °C. The maximum weight loss occurs at
temperature (Tmax) 387 °C, with only
1.24 wt % char residue at 600 °C, very close to that of the PLA.
In comparison, upon introducing APP into the PLA matrix, PLA/20APP
exhibits a slight lower Ti of 333 °C
but a much higher char residue of 11.3 wt % than PLA and PLA/5CNF,
this is probably because APP can catalyze the esterification and decomposition
of PLA at the beginning of the degradation stage and then promote
the formation of char. For PLA/APP@CNF, the decrease in Ti becomes more pronounced with increasing APP@CNF content.
Despite that, the char residue at 600 °C of APP@CNF significantly
increases from 3.93 to 12.6 wt % when the addition of APP@CNF increases
from 5 to 20 wt %. Interestingly, PLA/20APP@CNF displays a much lower Ti of 264 °C, but a little higher char residue
(12.6 wt %) than that of PLA/20APP. It is probably attributed to the
fact that APP can also catalyze the dehydration of CNF to generate
char. In addition, the trend of the TGA results of PLA and its biocomposites
in air atmosphere (as shown in Figure 3b) are very similar to those in nitrogen. However,
it should be noted that PLA/10APP@CNF still maintain a relatively
high Ti of 323 °C, which means that
the PLA/APP@CNF systems are still thermostable and can endure a relatively
high melt-processing window.

on the APP, CNF,
and APP@CNF in (a) nitrogen and (b) air conditions.

2.4 Flame Retardancy
Limiting oxygen
index (LOI) and vertical burning behaviors are used to evaluate the
flame-resistant properties of PLA composites,24 as summarized in Table 1. The pristine PLA only shows a LOI value of 19.5% and has
no rating in the UL-94 test.8,9 Incorporating 20 wt
% APP significantly increases the LOI up to 30.5%, whereas the presence
of 5 wt % CNF hardly affects the LOI value of the PLA. By contrast,
the LOI values of PLA/APP@CNF gradually increase with increase in
the loading level of APP@CNF. PLA/20 wt % APP@CNF shows a high LOI
value of 32.5%, an increase by 66.7% in comparison with pristine PLA.
In addition, PLA has no rating during UL-94 testing and exhibits no
flame retardancy classification. Twenty weight percentage APP makes
the PLA pass a UL-94 V-0 level, whereas adding 5 wt % CNF enables
PLA to achieve a V-2 rating, indicating limited improvement in the
flame retardancy of PLA/5% CNF. In comparison, similar to the LOI
change, the addition of APP@CNF into the PLA matrix leads to remarkably
reduced flammability. Unexpectedly, an APP@CNF loading level as low
as 5 wt % can make PLA pass a V-0 rating, implying a high flame-retardant
efficiency of APP@CNF in PLA. Comparably, 20 wt % phosphorylated microcrystalline
cellulose is still required to enable PLA to achieve a V-0 rating.25

a tign, pHRR, THR, average mass loss rate (AMLR), TSR, and
char refer to
the time to ignition, peak heat release rate, total heat rate, total
smoke release, and char residue, respectively.

The cone calorimeter has been widely
used for investigating the
fire behavior of polymeric materials to date because it can simulate
the real burning behavior of a material.26−28 Some crucial
parameters including heat release rate (HRR), total heat release (THR),
and time to ignition (tign) are exported
to quantitatively evaluate the combustion behavior. Figure 4a shows the HRR curves of PLA
and its composites, and Table 1 lists the related data. The pure PLA burns vigorously once
being ignited, with a peak heat release rate (pHRR) of 434 kW/m2, and finally generates a THR of 70.1 MJ/m2. By
contrast, although the pHRR and THR of PLA/5CNF are slightly decreased,
the dripping obviously disappears due to the suppression action of
the high length/diameter ratio of CNF on the melt flow of the PLA
during the cone tests. As compared with the PLA matrix, adding 20
wt % APP slightly reduce the tign to 61
s, the pHRR by 24% (to 328 kW/m2) and the THR by 33% (47
kW/m2), indicating significant flame retardancy. By contrast,
the addition of 5 wt % CNF shows a tign of 48 s and a pHRR of 375 kW/m2, indicating a marginal
reduction in flammability. For the PLA/APP@CNF systems, it is clearly
indicated that both pHRR and THR parameters effective decrease to
different degrees with increasing content of APP@CNF. For PLA/10APP@CNF,
pHRR and THR are reduced by 41% (about 255 kW/m2) and 17%
(about 57.9 MJ/m2) despite a short tign of 51 s as compared to PLA. Interestingly, after adding
20% APP@CNF, tign of PLA rebounds up to
60s and the pHRR further reduces to 193 kW/m2 (a decrease
by 56%) in addition to a THR of 53.6 MJ/m2. It is worth
pointing out that PLA/20APP@CNF shows much lower pHRR values than
PLA/5CNF and PLA/20APP, strongly suggesting the synergistic flame
retardancy between CNF and APP due to the unique material design and
improved fine dispersion.

Figure 4 (a) Heat release rate and (b) normalized mass
loss curves of PLA
and its biocomposites based on APP, CNF, and APP@CNF at an incident
heat flux of 35 kW/m2.

In addition, the average mass loss rate (AMLR) of PLA composites
shows a similar trend to the pHRR. As shown in Figure 4b and Table 1, adding 5% CNF increases, instead of reducing, the
AMLR of PLA from 0.079 to 0.1 g/s, implying that the presence of CNF
makes the PLA burn faster, whereas the addition of 20% APP can significantly
reduce the AMLR down to 0.059 g/s, showing that APP can slow down
the combustion process. In comparison, the AMLR seems to monotonously
decrease with increasing loading level of APP@CNF in the PLA; for
instance, 0.074 g/s for PLA/5APP@CNF, 0.067 g/s for PLA/10APP@CNF,
and 0.052 g/s for PLA/20APP@CNF. The steady reduction in AMLR indicates
that the presence of APP@CNF can slow down the combustion of PLA.
Moreover, the char residues after burning also show a monotonous increase
with the increase in APP@CNF content. The char residue of PLA/20APP@CNF
composite reaches 14.4 wt %, which is increased by about 96% compared
to that of PLA/5CNF composite. In addition, the total smoke production
(TSP) of the PLA composites also is given in Table 1. The similar trend to the char residue of
PLA composite indicates that the additive APP@CNF suppresses the combustion
of the PLA but causes the incomplete burning of volatile matter, thus
increasing the TSP of PLA composites. As shown in Table 1, the TSP value of PLA/10APP@CNF
and PLA/20APP@CNF is 106.6 and 142.7 m2/m2,
which is much higher than that of PLA/20APP composite. Combination
of all the results of cone, LOI, and UL-94 tests strongly indicates
that as-designed APP@CNF is a highly efficient flame retardant for
PLA.

2.5 Analysis of the Char Residue
To understand
how APP@CNF works in terms of reducing the flammability of the PLA,
the micromorphology, structure, and chemical composition of the char
residues after cone tests are comprehensively examined. Digital photos
of the char residues for PLA/20APP, PLA/5CNF, PLA/10APP@CNF, and PLA/20APP@CNF
after cone test are shown in Figure 5. In the case of PLA/20APP composite, the residue shows
an obvious compact char layer structure despite some cracks (Figure 5a). As for PLA/5CNF,
a very thin and fragmented char residue layer after burning can be
found in Figure 5b.
With regard to PLA/10APP@CNF and PLA/20APP@CNF, the morphologies of
the char residues differ substantially from those of PLA/20APP and
PLA/5CNF, as shown in Figure 5c,d. The char residues are dense with a few holes, maybe formed
by the APP@CNF system. When the content of APP@CNF increases to 20
wt %, the surface morphology of the char residue shows more grid holes
but a little collapse, indicating more APP@CNF may cause the char
layer to become rigid.

Figure 5 Digital photos for (a) PLA/20APP, (b) PLA/5CNF, (c) PLA/10APP@CNF,
and (d) PLA/20APP@CNF.

The microstructure of the char residues of the PLA composites
is
further observed by SEM. As shown in Figure 6a, the char residue of the PLA/APP shows
a basically smooth char layer, in good agreement with the relatively
good flame retardancy. In the case of the PLA/5CNF (Figure 6b), its char residue exhibits
a discontinuous structure with many voids or pores on the surface
because of blistering during combustion. Comparably, the char residue
of the PLA/10APP@CNF appears as a fibrous network, and the char layer
is also intact after fire tests (see Figure 6c). The fibrous char structure may partially
inherit from the CNF, as can be clearly observed with the help of
a higher magnification (Figure 6d). This chemical fibrous structure also enhances the structural
integrity of the char layer and improves the mechanical strength of
the char layer, as marked by blue arrows.

Figure 6 Morphology and chemical
structure of residue char for (a) PLA/20APP,
(b) PLA/5CNF, and (c, d) PLA/10APP@CNF.

The chemical structure and composition of the char residues
of
PLA/20APP, PLA/5CNF, and PLA/10APP@CNF were further investigated using
FT-IR and Raman spectra. As shown in Figure 7a, the IR spectrum of the char residue of
PLA/5CNF typically displays several absorption peaks located at around
3470 cm–1 (νO–H), 1760 cm–1 (νC=O), 1630 cm–1(νC=C), 1187 cm–1(νC–O), and 1096 cm–1 (νC–OH). The stretching vibration peak of methylene (CH2) groups
is also determined at 2922 cm−1. The spectra of
PLA/20APP and PLA/10APP@CNF seem significantly different from those
of PLA/5CNF. Specifically, the absorption bands at 1146, 1080, and
997 cm–1 are also determined, respectively, belonging
to the stretching vibration of P=O, P–O–C, P–O–P
groups.29−31 The existence of these absorption peaks indicates
that char layer contains the pyrophosphate species that can catalyze
the formation of char residues. Besides, Raman spectroscopy is also
used to further characterize the graphitization degree of the char
residue. The Raman spectra of the char residue of PLA/5CNF, PLA/20APP,
and PLA/10APP@CNF in Figure 7b exhibit two main bands, respectively, located at approximately
1590 cm–1 (G band) and 1370 cm–1 (D band). G-band corresponds to the vibration of sp2-hybrided
carbon atoms in graphite layers, whereas the D-band represents the
sp3-hybridized carbon and the presence of defect-like amorphous
domains.32,33 From Figure 7b, the G-band and D-band of PLA/5CNF are located at
1595 and 1370 cm–1, demonstrating that graphic and
disorder carbon structures are left in the char residue of PLA/CNF.
With respect to PLA/20APP, both G-band and D-band shift to lower wavenumbers,
centering at 1593 and 1357 cm–1, respectively, suggesting
the catalytic char-forming effect of APP. Compared with PLA/5CNF and
PLA/20APP, the char residue of PLA/10APP@CNF shows an increase in
G-band (1599 cm–1) and a decrease in D-band (1351
cm–1), primarily due to the catalytic char-forming
effect of APP and the participation of CNF in the char-forming process.34

Figure 7 (a) IR spectra and (b) Raman pattern of the residue char
for (1)
PLA/20APP, (2) PLA/5CNF, and (3) PLA/10APP@CNF systems after cone
tests.

Furthermore, the intensity ratio
(R) of D-band
to G-band (ID/IG) can indicate the graphitization degree of the char residue.33 Generally, a high R value implies
a low graphitization degree. The char of PLA/5CNF shows a high ID/IG of 1.22, indicating
a low graphitization degree. The addition of APP leads the char to
show a R value of 0.913, demonstrating a higher graphitization
degree. Different from the former two systems, the presence of APP@CNF
dramatically decreases the R value to 0.545, indicating
that APP@CNF can promote the graphitic order of char.35

Based on the above comprehensive analysis of char
residues, a possible
flame retardancy mechanism of APP@CNF can be proposed. The hybridization
via ball-milling in their aqueous solution enables APP@CNF to uniformly
disperse within the PLA matrix with smaller phase sizes than APP.
Its presence can significantly increase the melt viscosity,17 reduce HRR, and suppress the combustion behavior
of PLA, thereby significantly improving the flame retardancy of PLA.
When ignited, the APP in the hybridized flame retardant thermally
degrades to create polyphosphate species before the degradation of
PLA and CNF due to relatively lower thermal stability. Besides the
formation of a melt char substance themselves, these polyphosphate
species can to some extent catalyze both PLA and CNF to form a continuous,
compact layer by dehydration. Meanwhile, the CNF skeleton left in
the char during burning can maintain the intact structure of char
residue and prevent the char layer from cracking by reinforcing the
char. Therefore, APP@CNF strikingly reduces the flammability of PLA
by their synergistic work during combustion.

2.6 Mechanical
Performances
The mechanical
properties of PLA composites are evaluated to verify whether our design
can reverse the mechanical compromise. As shown in Figure 8a and Table 2, the pure PLA shows a high tensile strength
(σt) of about 58.0 MPa, an elastic modulus (E) of about 2.5 GPa, and a strain at break (ε) of
only 8.0%. This clearly indicates that the PLA is mechanically brittle.
After adding 5.0 wt % CNF, σt and E slightly increase. This negligible mechanical change is mainly attributed
to the poor dispersion of CNF in the PLA matrix and their weak interfacial
adhesion, as evidenced in Figure 2.

a σt, E, ε, σi, Tg, and
β, respectively, represent the tensile strength, Young modulus,
stain at break, impact strength, glass transition temperature, and
interfacial adhesion parameter.

With respect to the PLA/20APP system, the presence of APP markedly
decreases the tensile strength in spite of a marginally increase in
the modulus also because of their poor interfacial compatibility.
Theoretically, uniform dispersion, finer phase size, and robust interfacial
adhesion can promote efficient transfer of external loads from the
polymer matrix to the high-strength CNF.17,36−39 In addition, the high-strength CNF may also act as a mechanical
reinforcing agent for a flame-retardant system. As expected, the presence
of 5.0 wt % APP@CNF makes the PLA maintain a high σt of 50.3 MPa, despite a slight decrease in E and
ε. When 10 wt % APP@CNF is added into the PLA matrix, a high
σt of 48.6 MPa is still obtained. Further increasing
the content of APP@CNF only leads to an improved E and a slightly low σt, possibly due to the agglomeration
of APP@CNF at a high loading level. However, this strength is still
much higher than 33.2 MPa of PLA/20APP, probably because of the improved
dispersion and smaller phase sizes, as well as the mechanical reinforcement
of CNF on PLA.

Impact strength of PLA and its composites are
also measured to
evaluate their fracture toughness. As given in Figure 8b and Table 2, the pure PLA shows a low impact strength (σi) value of 7.64 kJ/m2. As expected, the addition
of 5 wt % CNF or 20 wt % APP only shows a marginal impact on σi due to poor dispersion and interfaces. In comparison, the
addition of 5 wt % APP@CNF improves σi to ∼11.8
kJ/m2, a 54% increase as compared with the PLA matrix,
whereas the same addition of CNF only brings a slight improvement,
about 8.10 kJ/m2. When the loading level reaches 10 wt
%, σi of PLA increases by 67% (about 12.7 kJ/m2) relative to the PLA bulk. Nevertheless, with the loading
of APP@CNF increasing to 20 wt %, σi of the PLA composites
sharply decreases to ∼4.81 kJ/m2, even lower than
that of PLA/20APP (∼8.53 kJ/m2). This implies that
a relatively low loading level of APP@CNF can contribute to the absorption
of the impact energy, whereas adding a higher loading over 10 wt %
of APP@CNF tends to form stress-concentration sites and leads to reduced
fracture toughness because of the formation of agglomeration within
the PLA matrix.

Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) measurements
were also carried
out to examine the dynamic mechanical performances of PLA and its
biocomposites. The plots of storage modulus (E′)
and loss factor (tan δ) curves versus temperature are
presented in Figure 8c,d. As also recorded in Table 2, basically the storage modulus displays a similar
trend to the elastic modulus obtained by tensile measurements, and
the modulus steadily increases with increasing loading level of APP@CNF.
The glass transition temperature (Tg)
can reflect the interfacial interactions between the filler and the
polymer matrix because its value strongly depends on the movement
capability of polymer segments. The presence of APP decreases Tg from 69.3 for the PLA matrix to 67.5 °C,
indicating the plasticization effect of APP, whereas the CNF hardly
affects the Tg value. In comparison, adding
10 and 20% basically makes the PLA maintain its Tg value, which indicates the good interfacial compatibility,
although the interface is not strong enough to restrict the movement
of PLA chains.

In addition, the peak values of tan δ
can provide
useful information on the interfacial adhesion between the fillers
and the PLA matrix, as shown in 1. 1  where (tan δmax)c and (tan δmax)m represent
the peak value of tan δ of the composites and the polymer
matrix obtained by the DMA tests, respectively, ϕ is the volume
fraction of the filler, and β refers to the interfacial adhesion
parameter. Generally, the larger the β value, the stronger the
interfacial adhesion.40 As shown in Table 2, both PLA/CNF and
PLA/APP systems show negative β values (−0.195 and −1.63,
respectively), strongly indicating their poor interfacial adhesion
and even thermodynamic exclusivity with the PLA matrix due to their
big polarity difference. By contrast, β values of 3.73 and 2.12
are obtained for PLA/10APP@CNF and PLA/20APP@CNF, respectively. The
big β values are correlated with the stronger interfacial adhesion.
The smaller β value for the latter is due to the possible agglomeration
of the higher content of APP@CNF, as evidenced by their tensile strength
and impact strength comparisons.

To understand the mechanical
failure mechanism, the fracture morphology
of the cross section of the PLA biocomposites after impact tests is
observed by SEM, as shown in Figure 8. Apparently, the fracture surface of PLA/20APP is
rather rough and discontinuous, with many holes and fragments, and
many exposed APP found at a higher magnification (see Figure 9a,a1) indicate poor interfacial
adhesion. As for PLA/5CNF in Figure 9b, the addition of CNF facilitates the formation of
a relatively integrated fracture surface due to relatively improved
interfacial interactions between the CNF and the PLA matrix, as also
evidenced by their close tensile strength values. As seen in Figure 9b1, with higher magnification,
some individual CNF can be found to be coated by the polymer layer,
further revealing the strong interface. By contrast, a much more continuous,
smooth, and uniform surface morphology of the fracture surface of
PLA/10APP@CNF is exhibited in Figure 9c,c1, indicating a good interfacial compatibility between
APP@CNF and the PLA matrix and a relatively fine dispersion. This
is in good accordance with the above mechanical results. However,
the fracture surface of PLA/20APP@CNF becomes nonhomogeneous and shows
a porous structure with many voids, some APP agglomerates, and fracture
interfaces (Figure 9d,d1), despite strong interfacial interactions among the three components.
This can also explain why PLA/20APP@CNF shows a smaller β value
than PLA/10APP@CNF. In brief, APP@CNF can form a relatively strong
interfacial adhesion with the PLA matrix, thus leading to the high
mechanical strength than APP because CNF can serve as the surface
modifier for APP during ball-milling and interfacial compatibilizer
between PLA and APP in the composites.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have successfully designed a new type of green
hybridized flame-retardant system (APP@CNF) by twining APP with CNF
as the surface modifier during ball-milling process based on their
strong H-bond interactions. APP@CNF can be uniformly dispersed into
the PLA matrix in the form of small phase sizes. The addition of only
5.0 wt % APP@CNF enables PLA to achieve a UL-94 V-0 rating in addition
to a LOI of 27.5%. The enhanced flame retardancy of APP@CNF in PLA
is primarily due to the catalytic char-forming capability of APP and
the synergistic effect of CNF by reinforcing the char layer. Incorporating
5.0 wt % of APP@CNF allows the flame-retardant PLA composite to maintain
a high tensile strength of 50.3 MPa. Moreover, as compared to the
PLA matrix, the impact strength is increased by 54%, reaching 11.8
kJ/m2, which is much higher than that of the PLA/APP and
PLA/CNF systems. This work offers a facile green strategy to create
high-performance, ecofriendly flame retardants and their advanced
polymer composites. It can also contribute to expanding the potential
application of biodegradable PLA in the automobile, packaging, and
electric and electronic fields.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA,
4032D) was obtained from Natureworks LLC. Ammonium polyphosphate (APP,
CK-APP101, n > 1000) was provided by Puyang Chengke
Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Henan, China). Cellulose nanofiber
(CNF, KY100) solid with 25 wt % CNF and 75 wt % water was purchased
from Daicel Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Japan). Other chemical
agents were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. Ltd. (Shanghai,
China). All the chemical reagents were of analytical grade and used
without further purification.

4.2 Preparation
of APP@CNF
One gram of
CNF was added into 99 mL deionized water with the aid of high-speed
dispersion (T81 IKA, Germany) to prepare a 1.0 wt% CNF mixture. Then,
a certain amount of APP was put into the above suspension under magnetic
stirring, and the mass ratio of APP/CNF was 6/1. Subsequently, the
mixture was placed into an agate ball-mill capsule (250 mL) containing
agate balls (diameter ranging from 1 to 5 mm). The capsule was fixed
in the planetary ball-mill machine and agitated at 400 rpm for 8 h.
Finally, the resultant product was obtained by filtrating and drying
at 80 °C under reduced pressure until the weight did not change.
A white solid powder was obtained and designated as APP@CNF, and its
typical synthetic route is shown in Figure 1a.

4.3 Composites Fabrication
The PLA composites
were prepared by melt compounding of PLA, APP, CNF, or APP@CNF using
a ThermoHaake Torque Rheometer with a rotor speed of 60 rpm at 170
°C for 10 min. The formulations of the samples are designed as
follows: PLA/xAPP, PLA/xCNF, and
PLA/xAPP@CNF, x refers to the mass
fraction of APP@CNF in the composite; for example, PLA/20APP containing
20 wt % APP and 80 wt % PLA. Other composites were also prepared according
to the same protocol for comparison, respectively.

4.4 Characterization
The FT-IR spectra
were recorded on a Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR spectrometer. The sample
powders were mixed with KBr. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM;
JEM-1200EX) was employed to observe the morphologies of CNF, APP,
and APP@CNF, as well as their dispersion in the PLA matrix at 200
kV. The microstructure of the PLA composites was investigated by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM, FEI-SEM, Japan), with an accelerating voltage
of 15 kV. Thermogrametric analysis (TGA) was carried out on a TA SDTQ600
(TA Instruments) thermogravimetric analyzer at a heating rate of 20 °C/min
under N2 or air atmosphere. The Raman spectra of char were
obtained on a Nicolet Almega dispersive Raman spectrometer (Thermo
Scientific) with a 514 nm laser source. The Fire behavior of the samples
was evaluated by a free time test U.K. device according to ISO 5660
with an incident flux of 35 kW/m2. The samples with a size
of 100 × 100 × 3.0 mm3 were wrapped in an aluminum
foil. Limited oxygen index values (LOI) were measured using an HC-2
oxygen index instrument on 120 × 6 × 3 mm3 sheets
according to the standard oxygen index test ASTM D2863. The UL-94
vertical burning tests were conducted by Jiangning CZF-3 vertical
burning test instrument according to ASTM D3801 standard. The dimensions
of samples were 130 × 13 × 3 mm3. The tensile
and impact properties of the samples were measured on a WD-5 electronic
universal tensile tester and a Charpy impact tester, according to
ASTM 638-03 and GB/T 1043-93, respectively. Dynamic mechanical analyzer
(DMA242C, TA) was used to conducted the dynamic mechanical analysis
(DMA) of the PLA composites from −40 to +130 °C at a frequency
of 1 Hz with a heating rate of 3 °C/min. The glass transition
temperature (Tg) was determined from the
peak of loss factor (tan δ) versus temperature plots.

The phase sizes of APP and APP@CNF within the PLA matrix were analyzed
by image analysis software via micrographs, and over 100 particles
were chosen. The weight-average diameter (dw) of the particles was calculated according to the following 2 2  Weight-average
particle size (dw), where ni is the number
of particles with a size of di.
