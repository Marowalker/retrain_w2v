First-principles calculations done
via density functional theory
were used to study the structural and electronic properties of sodium
montmorillonite clay (Mt-Na+) of general formula MxAl3Si8O24H4Na·nH2O (Mx: Mg or Fe). The final position of the interlamellar sodium
atom is found to be close to the oxygen atoms located on the upper
surface of silica. Following Fe-Mt-Na+ system relaxation,
with subsequent analysis of magnetic moment and magnetic states, the
electroneutrality of the system established that both Fe2+ and Fe3+ oxidation states are possible to occur. The
Mg2+-Mt-Na+ material shows a band gap energy
greater than that of Fe2+-Mt-Na+ when iron is
in the octahedral site. It is found that the valence-band maximum
and the conduction-band minimum of iron-doped montmorillonite are
both at the Γ-point, while it is at V →
Γ for magnesium-doped montmorillonite. The calculated band gap
from hybrid functional (HSE06) of Fe2+-Mt-Na+ is equal to 4.3 eV, exhibiting good agreement with experimental
results obtained from ultraviolet–visible spectroscopy of the
natural Mt-Na+ (Cloisite-Na+).

1 Introduction
Clays,
the most abundant minerals found on the surface of the earth,
are a natural material of texture and fine granulation and can be
classified as cationic (montmorillonites = Mt or other smectites)
and anionic (lamellar double hydroxides LDH). The cationic variety
consist of materials with negatively charged aluminosilicates layers
and interlamellar cations neutralizing the charges. The anionic variety
are clay materials containing anions in the interlamellar domain.1,2 The montmorillonites belong to the 2:1 group of filosilicates, whose
structure consists of two tetrahedral (T) sheets of silica with an
octahedral (O) center sheet of alumina joined together by oxygen atoms
that are common to both sheets (T–O–T).3 The stacking of these layers is governed by relatively
weak short-range attractive van der Waals forces. Different isomorphic
substitutions can occur, where the most common substitutions responsible
for negatively charged layers are Al3+ by Mg2+, Fe2+, or Fe3+ in octahedral coordination
and Si4+ by Al3+ or Fe3+ in tetrahedral
coordination. To compensate the negative charges, the interlamellar
region is occupied by cations such as Na+, K+, and Ca2+.1−4 Different kinds of isomorphic substitutions in the lamellae as well
as in the cations in the interlamellar region bring distinct physical
and chemical properties to montmorillonite. Moreover, these layered
structures are also possible to occur through charge balance, leading
the systems to an equilibrium state. Sainz-Días et al. reported
different results for montmorillonites with isomorphic substitution
of Si4+ by Al3+ and Fe3+ in the tetrahedral
coordination layer, where the trivalent cations are responsible for
the layer charge. The authors obtained similar behavior for Al3+ replaced by Fe3+ in the octahedral layer where
other atoms, such as Mg2+ octahedrally coordinated, are
responsible for the excess of negative charge in the system, or yet
Al3+ and Fe3+ in the tetrahedral layer.5,6 A few other studies have shown mixing of Al, Fe, and Mg in the octahedral
layer, where in this case magnesium is responsible for the negative
charge in the structure.7,8

Polymer–clay
nanocomposites present improved flame retardancy
and thermal properties as compared to those of the pristine polymer
matrix. The physical barrier induced by the clay and radical trapping
assisted by the presence of selected 3d atoms in the inorganic phase
are responsible for these properties. Carvalho et al.9,10 have shown that structural Fe3+ atoms in the octahedral
layer of natural Mt are reduced into Fe2+ due to trapping
of radicals formed during poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) thermal
decomposition by in situ structural monitoring of PMMA-Mt thermal
degradation. The presence of iron in the clay composition improves
the polymer thermal stability, while the nanoconfinement created by
clay layers induces radical recombination with iron and consequently
delays depolymerization.9,10

It has also been
demonstrated that iron-modified montmorillonite
interacts strongly with organic materials.11 Moreover, the combination of mineral clay with iron, aiming to produce
magnetic adsorbents, has shown to be a promising material to remove
organic pollutants in wastewater. This is possible because magnetic
adsorbents have active sites with affinity for organic and/or inorganic
compounds that, after adsorption, can be separated from the medium
by an external magnetic field.12,13

The characterization
of the smectites is usually done by observing
the diffraction plane d001 that corresponds
to the basal spacing between the lamellae. The basal spacing (lattice
parameter c) corresponding to the peak d001 of a smectite can vary greatly, depending on the isomorphic
substitution and the nature of cations exchange. The ability to exchange
interplanar cations of Mt clays, known as cation exchange capacity,
varies in the range of 80–150 mequiv/100 g, and the main technological
properties of smectites are complemented by their high surface areas,
in the range of 75–150 m2/g2,14 making them efficient adsorbents, in particular,
to the removal of metallic ions from the environment.15 Likewise, these materials have wide industrial applications,
such as catalysts,16 support and catalyst
precursors such as adsorbents and ion exchangers, and lamellar nanofillers
in polymer nanocomposite materials,17,18 among others.
Mt-Na+ is also a good filter for pollutants such as nitrobenzene19 and methylene blue11 and is a practical and promising solid electrolyte material due
to the conductance properties of high valence ions therein.20 In all of these applications, a good understanding
of the montmorillonite structure is crucial.

Computational simulations
provide a powerful tool to determine
the most probable positions of the cations in the lamellae, as well
as the number of cations in the interlamellar domain. Tavares et al.
and Costa et al., using ab initio density functional theory (DFT)
calculations with periodic boundary conditions, were able to accurately
predict crystallographic and electronic properties of clays such as
double lamellar hydroxides.21,22 There are several theoretical
studies that analyze the hydration of ions confined in the interlayer
space of montmorillonites,23−26 investigations that involve the interaction of organic
components which exploit the adsorptive properties of Mt27−31 for application as adsorbent of pollutants, and other medical applications.

Only few ab initio density functional theory (DFT) studies have
considered the smectites dehydrated phases.25,26 Fonseca et al. investigated the structure of the dehydrated montmorillonite
with isomorphic substitutions of Al3+ by Mg2+ in the tetrahedral layer, and Si4+ by Al3+ in the octahedral layer. Particularly, this study shows the relation
to the atomic arrangements within the lamellae comparing DFT calculations
and the results of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. DFT
based studies have shown to be a valuable method for describing the
structures and dehydration of the Mt-Na+ compound.32 Such studies reinforce that the dehydrated montmorillonite
is potential for the synthesis of, for example, nanocomposites based
on hydrophobic polymers such as PMMA, which exhibits low polymerization
in the presence of water.33

Taking
into account the present studies that modify smectite clays
with iron, the montmorillonite chemical formula was assumed to be
MxAl3Si8O24H4Na (Mx: Mg and Fe), similar
to that of pyrophyllite (Si8Al4O20(OH)4), also a member of the smectite clay group. The
structure of Mt is similar to that of pyrophyllite,14 nearsighted for the appropriate isomorphic substitution.
The calculations presented in this work were performed on the dehydrated
montmorillonite.

Based on theoretical works on clays,21−29 they have been shown to be suitable to construct the montmorillonite
system by using the supercell approach that allows for the successfully
description of the tetrahedral and octahedral lamellae, as well as
the interlamellar region. The modeling of these compounds can be done
using, as basis, the structure of the phyllosilicate 2:1, through
the isomorphic substitution of (i) Al atoms by Mg or Fe atoms in the
octahedral sheet, (ii) Si atoms by Fe, and the intercalation of cations
such as Na+ in the interlamellar region. This model is
widely adopted in several studies32,35,36 since it provides the possibility of determining
(i) the most probable positions of cations in lamellae, (ii) the difference
in charge densities between lamella, (iii) different intercalated
cations and its dependence on interlayer cation species, and (iv)
the type of isomorphic substitution. Additionally, in contrast to
these extensive simulation studies that have been carried out in the
last decade, recent very few theoretical works focus on structural
and electronic properties of the montmorillonite doped with magnesium
and no studies have been found in which iron is present in the structure.
In particular, an ab initio investigation of montmorillonite is still
lacking.

In this work, a series of first-principles DFT calculations
of
the montmorillonite is reported by employing different approaches
for the exchange–correlation potential for each studied system.
The structural and electronic properties of Mt-Na+ isomorphically
replaced by Mg and Fe are obtained, and results for band structures,
density of states, and magnetic properties are discussed. Moreover,
in this work is shown the results of ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy experiments performed with pristine sodium Mt clays (Cloisite-Na+). The experimental results confirm the theoretical predictions.

2 Computational Methodology
Ab Initio Study
All of the calculations
were performed
within the DFT.41−44 The projector augmented wave method as implemented in the Vienna
ab initio simulation package45,50−52 was employed in this study. For the exchange–correlation
potential, the generalized gradient approximation within the Perdew,
Burke, and Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) approach was adopted. We also used
the modified Becke–Johnson (GGA-mBJ) potential approximation46,47 to investigate the improvement in the band gap value. Additionally,
also used here is the modified hybrid functional in mBJ which has
the exchange term proposed by Beck48 and
the correlation term as proposed by Heyd–Scuseria–Ernzerhof49 (HSE06), which is found to greatly improve the
band gap description.50−52

The supercell model34 is used to construct the Mt-Na+ system considering a
multilayer system with the convergence criterion for the electronic
band structures in the Mt-Na+ system considered in the
limit of large supercells. After increasing the supercell size, we
found that the 41-atom supercell is large enough to perform accurate
calculations with periodic boundary conditions. Due to the use of
a large supercell, the self-consistent calculations were performed
at the gamma point only. On the other hand, for density-of-state calculations,
a 4 × 2 × 2 Monkhorst–Pack53k-point mesh was adopted for the Brillouin zone
(BZ) integrations. All of the calculations were performed with a 450
eV energy cutoff in the planewave expansions. The equilibrium structure
for each case was obtained through ionic relaxations performed until
the residual forces on the ions were less than 10 meV/Å.

3 Results and Discussion
The calculations of the electronic
structure of the MxAl3Si8O24H4Na clays were performed using a
41-atom supercell containing 4 H,
24 O, 3 Al, 8 Si, and 1 Na. The valence configuration of each atom
is shown in Table 1. The montmorillonite has monoclinic structure and space group C2/m14 with
the expanded crystal structure of Mt-Na+ shown in Figure 1.

and Si2 are sites where the iron impurity
was introduced.

According to Figure 1, Mt-Na+ was simulated considering eight
possible isomorphic
substitutions with different configurations, namely, (C1) MgAl1, magnesium substituted for aluminum (Al1); (C2) FeAl1, iron substituted for aluminum (Al1); (C3) FeSi1, iron
substituted for silicon (Si1); (C4) FeAl1–FeSi1, two irons substituted for aluminum (Al1) and silicon (Si1);
(C5) FeA1l–FeSi2, two irons substituted
for aluminum (Al1) and silicon (Si2); (C6) FeAl1–FeAl2, two irons substituted for two aluminum atoms (Al1 and
Al2); (C7) FeAl1–FeAl3, two irons substituted
for two aluminum atoms (Al1 and Al3); and (C8) MgAl1–FeAl2, one magnesium substituted for aluminum (Al1) and one iron
substituted for aluminum (Al2).

After full relaxations, and
in all cases, it was found that the
stable configuration of the Na+ cation is close to the
oxygen atoms present on the upper surface of silica. This effect is
related to the electrostatic attraction between lamellar and interlamellar
cations. Around each Mg/Fe impurity site, there is an excess of negative
charge −1 that needs to be compensated by sodium cation (charge
+1) that are located in the interlamellar domain to establish the
system’s electroneutrality.54 Lattice
parameters (bond distances in Å and angles in degrees) were optimized
for equivalent structures of dehydrated Mg-Mt-Na+ (C1 case),
producing a unit cell compatible with the experimental one. A good
agreement between calculated and experimental results is observed.
The basal spacing, c, equal to 10.08 Å is comparable
with the theoretical range 10.06–10.28 Å32,33 and with experimental interval 9.83–12.1 Å.55,56 It was observed that the Al–O bond lengths are longer than
the Si–O bond lengths, indicating that Al–O bonds are
weaker in strength than the Si–O bonds, thus indicating that
it is more probable to find montmorillonites composed of mixed octahedrons.
A complete comparison between structural constants of dehydrated montmorillonite
Mg-Mt-Na+ and experimental results is shown in Table 2.

are also shown.

Figure 2a shows
the band structure of Mg-Mt-Na+ along the high-symmetry
lines in the BZ obtained from GGA-PBE functional.46 A zoomed plot around the band gap region is shown in Figure
2b. The calculation was done in the first BZ on the path Y–A–Γ–Y–M–Γ–V–L– Γ, as depicted in Figure 2c. The band structure
presented in Figure 2b indicates that the conduction-band minimum (CBM) (lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital) is at the V-point and the valence-band
maximum (VBM) (highest occupied molecular orbital) is at the Γ-point.
Thus, the montmorillonite isomorphically substituted with Mg depicts
a band gap of 4.63 eV, which implies that it is a material with insulating
characteristics. This result is in good agreement with other theoretical
results found in the literature.36,57,58

for the conduction band. The Fermi (EF) level is at the zero energy; (b) zoomed around the band gap region

first Brillouin zone.

The projected density
of states (PDOS) for Mg, Al, O, H, Si, and
Na are shown in Figure 3, together with the total density of states (TDOS) for Mg2+-Mt-Na+. The upper part of the VB has mainly O-p orbital
character, while the CB bottom has a higher character of Na-s orbitals.
These results for MgAl3Si8O24H4Na are in good accordance with experimental data as well as
previous theoretical results available in the literature.26,36,57

states (PDOS) and total
density of states (TDOS) for the Mg-Mt-Na+ compound. The
Fermi (EF) level is at the zero energy.

Figure 4 shows the
results of UV–vis spectroscopy measurements performed with
pristine sodium Mt clays (Cloisite-Na+), which has in its
composition Si, Al, Fe, O, H, and Na. To determine the size of the
band gap energy, we carried out spectroscopy measurements in the UV–vis
region using the powdered clay sample. The band gap energy (Eg) was estimated by the Tauc method from absorbance
data.37−39 A direct band gap energy Eg = 4.0 eV was determined by extrapolating the linear region (αhυ)2 versus photon energy.

Mt-Na+ determined from the
Tauc method.

In contrast, Figure 5 shows for Fe-Mt-Na+ (C2 case) the calculated band structure
of montmorillonite along the high-symmetry lines of the BZ using the
GGA-PBE for the exchange–correlation potential. The obtained
band gap energy (∼1.4 eV) is much smaller than the experimental
value, thus leading to the conclusion that the GGA-PBE approach alone
is not sufficient to determine the band gap energy of Fe-Mt-Na+.

Figure 5 Band structure, along high-symmetry lines of the BZ, for Fe-doped
montmorillonite as obtained by GGA-PBE calculations for case C2. The
Fermi level (EF) is at the zero energy.

To obtain a better result of the band gap energy,
calculations
were performed using the mBJ approach wherein the value for the band
gap found to be 7.0 eV, which is too large when compared to the experimental
result found by the Tauc method. Another improvement made toward improving
the description of the Fe-Mt-Na+ band gap was to perform
calculations including the exact components of the exchange energy
as obtained via the Hartree–Fock method by means of the hybrid
functional (HSE06). A suitable result of 4.3 eV was obtained as compared
with the experimental value presented in Figure 4.

As shown in Figure 6, both the conduction-band minimum (CBM)
and the valence-band maximum
(VBM) are at the Γ point, indicating a direct gap of 4.3 eV.
Therefore, HSE06 is the most appropriate approach to correctly describe
the electronic structure of the Fe-Mt-Na+ system in the
C2 configuration. As the hybrid functional calculations require a
larger computational cost, the band structures shown in Figure 6 were performed only for the A → Γ path. The flat bands have iron d-level
character.

direction A → Γ, as obtained through
the hybrid functional (HSE06) calculations for case C2.

Figure 7 shows
the
TDOS and PDOS obtained for the Fe-Mt-Na+ system using GGA-PBE.
We observe that the valence bands in a wide energy range −12.5
eV < E < EF are
predominantly composed of oxygen p-orbitals. Since iron introduces
energy levels in the upper part of the VB, it causes repulsion with
the electrons arising from oxygen atoms pushing up the iron-related
levels to higher energies. This gives rise to an internal gap of about
3.0 eV (2.0 eV) obtained from the GGA-PBE (HSE06) calculations.

Figure 7 TDOS and PDOS
of montmorillonite obtained with GGA-PBE for case
C2. The Fermi energy is set to zero.

Figure 8 shows the
charge density plot of the atoms occupying sites that influence the
band gap region. Both the charge density of the uppermost occupied
VB state and the probability density of the first unoccupied CB state
have mainly oxygen p and iron d orbital character. When iron is added
to the compound, it becomes mostly responsible for the majority of
the charge density distribution shown, placing occupied and unoccupied
d-related levels close to the top of the valence and the CB bottom,
respectively.

Figure 8 Charge density plot associated with the uppermost occupied
valence
band state (purple) and probability density of the first unoccupied
conduction band state (green), for case C2. Both states have mainly
oxygen p and iron d orbital character.

To estimate the oxidation state of Fe-substituting Al1 for case
C2, an analysis of the local coordination and the number of unpaired
electrons was done via magnetic moment calculation. The d orbitals
of the iron impurity are split by the crystalline field in the material,
and due to the octahedral field (FeAl1), gives rise to
a tridegenerate t2g and a bidegenerate eg level.
The difference in energy between the t2g and eg levels is about 1.4 eV using GGA-PBE. Figure 9 shows the PDOS related to the Fe d-derived
energy levels of t2g and eg symmetries of montmorillonite,
as obtained in the GGA-PBE calculations. A magnetic moment of ∼4
μB was found, demonstrating a 2+ (Fe2+) oxidation state. Fe2+ substituting an Al3+ is in agreement with electroneutrality requirement, which means
a negative charge excess (−1e) from each Fe2+ substitution
to neutralize the positive charge from the intercalated sodium cation
(Na+). This charge excess is delocalized almost uniformly
all over the basal oxygen atoms of the silica surface, which attracts
the sodium atoms. Therefore, this result clearly indicates that the
location of Na+ cation close to the clay surface is governed
by the presence of negative charge centers in the clay materials.32,54 The same value of magnetic moment (∼4 μB) was obtained from the HSE06 calculations; however, as expected,
disagreement occurred for the energy difference between t2g and eg levels that showed a more realistic value, ∼5
eV, as revealed in Figure 6.

Figure 9 PDOS associated with the Fe d-derived energy levels of t2g and eg symmetries of montmorillonite, obtained using
GGA-PBE, for case C2. The Fermi energy is set to zero.

To seek a more complete understanding of oxidation states
of the
iron impurity taking in place at different sites in the Mt-Na+ material, a similar oxidation state analysis was performed
for cases ranging from C3 to C8 configurations. In case C3, for Fe
substitution for Si4+ at a tetrahedral site, the magnetic
moment of ∼5 μB was obtained from GGA-PBE
and HSE06 calculations, indicating a 3+ (Fe3+) oxidation
state, meaning that a negative charge excess from each Fe3+ substitution neutralizes the positive charge from the intercalated
Na+. The obtained energy difference between eg and t2g levels is about 4.7 eV.

An increase of
iron impurity concentration was simulated from C4
to C7 configurations, highlighting for C4 (FeAl1–FeSi1), two irons substituted for aluminum (Al1) and silicon
(Si1); C5 (FeAl1–FeSi2), two irons substituted
for aluminum (Al1) and silicon (Si2); C6 (FeAl1–FeAl2), two irons substituted for two aluminums (Al1 and Al2);
and C7 (FeAl1–FeAl3), two irons substituted
for two aluminums (Al1 and Al3). For each case, two different distances
between impurities as well as the ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic
(AFM) configurations were considered, as shown in Figure 10. The AFM configuration was
the most stable for the C4 and C5 cases. For both cases, the magnetic
moments of iron substituted for aluminum and silicon are 5.0μB, which means a 3+ oxidation state (Fe3+) as expected.
The C4 and C5 cases also show that a negative charge excess from Fe3+ substituted for Si4+ neutralizes the positive
charge from the intercalated Na+. No charge excess happens
to other Fe3+ substituted for Al3+.

magnetic state possibilities for configurations
C4 (a) AFM and (b) FM; C5 (c) AFM and (d) FM; C6 (e) AFM and (f) FM;
and C7 (g) AFM and (h) FM.

For the C6 and C7 cases, an FM state was observed and the magnetic
moment of the two Fe substituted for two Al was 4.0 μB with a 2+ oxidation state (Fe2+) for the first and 1.0
μB with oxidation state 3+ (Fe3+) for
the second. For both configurations, a negative charge excess from
Fe2+ substituted for the first aluminum Al3+ neutralizes the positive charge from the intercalated Na+. No charge excess occurs for Fe3+ substituted for a second
Al3+.

For both pairs C4, C5 and C6, C7, the oxidation
states did not
depend on the distance between iron impurities, even having an oxygen
atom shared as shown for cases C4 (Al1–O–Si1) and C7
(Al1–O–Al3). Table 3 shows a summary of oxidation states for all cases.

For C8 configuration, in which one
magnesium replaces one aluminum
(Al1) and one iron replaces one aluminum (Al2), after a full relaxation,
a magnetic moment equal to 5 μB for the iron atom
was obtained. This result shows that iron has an oxidation state equal
to 3+ (Fe3+) in substitution of aluminum 3+ (Al3+). On the other hand, magnesium has an oxidation state equal to 2+
(Mg2+), being responsible to neutralize the positive charge
from the intercalated Na+.

4 Conclusions
The structural and electronic properties of magnesium- and iron-doped
montmorillonite in several configurations were studied through first-principles
calculations using density functional theory. The results obtained
for Mg2+-Mt-Na+ using GGA-PBE indicated an underestimation
of the band gap energy at 4.63 eV. For a single iron substituted for
aluminum (C2 configuration), the underestimated GGA-PBE band gap energy
of only ∼1.4 eV was obtained. Using the hybrid functional (HSE06)
approach, a value of 4.3 eV was found, in excellent agreement with
the value obtained from ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy measurements of 4.0 eV. The charge density and the density
of states alongside the magnetic moment analysis have shown that the
oxidation state of the iron impurity substituted for Al3+ is 2+ (Fe2+) and introduces d-related energy levels in
the band gap of the material, giving the material a semiconductor
character. The electroneutrality of the system was established via
magnetic moment and magnetic state analysis, and it was found that
both Fe2+ and Fe3+ oxidation states are possible
to occur, where the state depends only on the site iron occupies in
the Mt-Na+ structure. For cases C4 and C5, both iron impurities
have oxidation state 3+. In the cases C6 and C7, a mixing of iron
impurities with oxidation states 2+ and 3+ was observed. For case
C8, where one magnesium substitutes one aluminum (Al1) and one iron
substitutes one aluminum (Al2), iron has an oxidation state equal
to 3+ (Fe3+) in substitution of aluminum 3+ (Al3+) and magnesium has an oxidation state equal to 2+ that is responsible
to neutralize the positive charge from the intercalated Na+.

5 Experimental Section
UV–Vis Spectroscopy
Optical absorption spectroscopy
measurements are fundamental tools in the study of electronic properties
of materials, mainly semiconductors. In this context, ultraviolet–visible
spectroscopy (UV–vis) offers a convenient method to estimate
the optical band gap since it probes electronic transitions between
the valence band and the conduction band by diffuse reflectance spectra.
Diffuse reflection comprises a process that occurs when radiation
penetrates a solid substrate. Part of this radiation returns to the
surface of the substrate, also causing multiple dispersion and partial
absorption of the radiation by the particles or fibers that constitute
the solid substrate. In this case, the band gap is determined from
Tauc plots obtained from diffuse reflectance spectra.37 The absorption coefficient (α) was determined from
optical absorption data and the nature of the transition by plotting
graphs of (αhυ)2 as a function
of the energy of the incident photon (hυ),
with υ being the frequency and h being the
Plank constant. The band gap energy is determined by the intersection
point of the tangent line to the point of inflection of the curve
and the horizontal axis.38,39

A sample of natural
montmorillonite containing Si, Al, Fe, O, H, and Na from Southern
Clay Products Inc., Texas, was used for the absorption spectroscopy
measurements in the UV–vis region aiming to determine the experimental
optical band gap value. Absorption spectra analysis of the powdered
clay was performed using a Lambda 1050 UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer),
programmed for the reflectance mode with wavelengths in the range
of 200–800 nm. Since experimental setup must be constructed
with a reference that fully reflects light such that the largest wavelength
possible has a reflectance equal to 1, magnesium oxide (MgO) was adopted
as a reference material due to its absolute reflectance in the visible
range (0.98).40
