The effect of modifying an η-alumina
methyl chloride synthesis
catalyst by doping with CsCl and KCl over the concentration range
of 0.1–1.0 mmol g(cat)–1 is investigated
by a combination of pyridine chemisorption coupled with infrared spectroscopy
and mass-selective temperature-programmed desorption measurements.
The loading of group 1 metal chloride is equivalent to a titrant that
enables selective neutralization of Lewis acid sites present at the
surface of the reference η-alumina catalyst. Specifically, a
loading of 0.1 mmol g(cat)–1 is sufficient
to neutralize the strong Lewis acid sites; a loading of 0.6 mmol g(cat)–1 is sufficient to neutralize the strong
and medium-strong Lewis acid sites; a loading of 1.0 mmol g(cat)–1 neutralizes all of the strong and medium-strong
Lewis acid sites and partially neutralizes the medium-weak Lewis acid
site. These deductions connect with a catalyst design program to develop
a methyl chloride synthesis catalyst that exhibits minimal formation
of the byproduct dimethyl ether.

1 Introduction
Methyl
chloride is an important chemical compound: in 1997, productions
within the regions of United States, western Europe, and Japan were
0.51, 0.48, and 0.14 Mton, respectively.1 The global chloromethane market is expected to garner $2171.6 million
by 2022, with the market exhibiting a compound annual growth rate
of 4.63% over the period 2016–2022.2 Methyl chloride is used for the methylation of phenols, alcohols,
and cellulose. It is also used in the manufacture of methylchlorosilanes
(precursors to silicones) and quaternary ammonium salts.1 Two principal routes dominate the industrial-scale
manufacture of methyl chloride: (i) methane chlorination and (ii)
the esterification of methanol with anhydrous hydrogen chloride. The
latter route is performed in the liquid or gaseous phase and may involve
catalysts such as ZnCl2, CuCl2, H3PO4, or Al2O3. Presently, the hydrochlorination
of methanol is thought to be the most important commercially exploited
route to methyl chloride;1 this article
examines aspects of the surface chemistry of this process over η-alumina-based
catalysts 1   2  eq 1 describes methyl
chloride synthesis from the reaction between
methanol and anhydrous hydrogen chloride, with the reaction thought
to be favored over Lewis acid sites.3 Selectivity
to methyl chloride is reduced by the reaction shown in eq 2, where the alcohol is converted
to dimethyl ether. The reactions shown in eqs 1 and 2 are both reversible;
so, at any given feed composition and temperature, there is an equilibrium
product composition. An improved methyl chloride synthesis catalyst
will catalyze reaction 1 more effectively than reaction 2.

Schmidt and co-workers have examined methyl chloride
synthesis
via the hydrochlorination of methanol over a range of materials. Representative
studies include the use of microreactors4,5 and the use
of ZnCl2-modified zeolite and alumina-based catalysts.6,7 The latter work illustrates how the addition of a zinc salt can
modify the acid properties of a γ-alumina catalyst to beneficially
influence product yields.

Following a series of investigations
connected with the use of
η-Al2O3 as a methyl chloride synthesis
catalyst,3,8−16 in 2016, McInroy and co-workers proposed a mechanism for methyl
chloride production over this material.17 Furthermore, as part of an academic/industrial collaboration, the
work additionally considered a role for chemical modifiers to improve
product selectivity. This was in response to an industrial driver
to reduce the quantities of dimethyl ether in the product stream.
The formation of dimethyl ether during methyl chloride production
is problematical in the industrial operation, as the byproduct can
react with chlorine elsewhere in the chloromethane production process
to produce undesirable chlorinated ethers.17 Thus, from the industrial perspective, enhanced methyl chloride
selectivity is the primary objective.

The 2016 study by McInroy
et al. showed how the addition of group
1 metal salts to the well-characterized η-alumina catalyst could
lead to commercially significant improvements in product selectivity.17 Specifically, the doping of the η-alumina
reference catalyst with CsCl and KCl in the range of 0–1.0
mmol g(cat)–1 attenuated dimethyl ether
formation. For example, although the doping of the η-alumina
catalyst leads to a reduction in the rate of CH3Cl formation
(1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 reduces the production
rate for CH3Cl at 560 K by 57%), it nevertheless significantly
improves the product selectivity (1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 increases the methyl chloride selectivity at 563
K from 94.5 to 99.6%). On balance, CsCl doping at a loading of ≥0.3
mmol g(cat)–1 was considered to represent
the best catalyst formulation for a sustained CH3Cl production
with minimal formation of CH3OCH3, where the
kinetic control of the product composition was possible.17 Concerning the origins for these improvements
in catalytic performance, and with reference to previous characterization
studies,10 it was surmised that the group
1 salts were “capping” the strong and medium-strong
(MS) Lewis acid sites of the η-alumina catalyst and that methyl
chloride production was occurring solely on medium-weak (MW) Lewis
acid sites.17

The present communication
explores the matter of the acid site
distribution present on the η-alumina catalyst18 and uses pyridine as a probe molecule to discern how the
group 1 metal salts within the designated concentration range moderate
the distribution of the η-alumina Lewis acid sites to yield
a more selective methyl chloride synthesis catalyst. A combination
of pyridine chemisorption, infrared spectroscopy, and temperature-programmed
desorption is adopted throughout, enabling a site-selective model
to be proposed that can be linked to improvements in catalytic performance.
The use is made of a previously reported four-site surface structural
model for η-alumina reported by Lundie and co-workers that comprises
(i) strong, (ii) medium-strong, (iii) medium-weak, and (iv) weak-strength
Lewis acid sites.10 Whereas infrared spectroscopy
of chemisorbed pyridine as a probe base was able to reproduce the
accepted three-site model of strong, medium, and weak Lewis acid sites
via the pyridine 8a ν(C–C) mode,19,20 complementary temperature-programmed desorption experiments were
able to subdivide the medium-strength Lewis acid site into medium-strong
and medium-weak Lewis acid sites.10 In
combination with the 2016 publication by McInroy et al., which reports
that microreactor test outcomes for group 1 metal salts modified η-alumina
catalysts,17 this article describes a component
of a catalyst design process and rationalizes how certain modifications
to the reference catalyst (η-alumina) can minimize byproduct
formation. Thus, the work constitutes an example of industrial-scale
Green Chemistry, with catalytic science being the enabling technology.21

2 Results
2.1 IR Studies
of Pyridine Adsorption Over CsCl-
and KCl-Doped η-Al2O3 Catalysts
2.1.1 Py(ad) ν(C–C) Modes
Figure 1 presents
the infrared spectrum in the region of 1700–1400 cm–1 of a saturated overlayer of chemisorbed pyridine as a function of
CsCl doping concentration. Figure 1a represents the undoped η-alumina reference
catalyst that has been comprehensively analyzed by Lundie and co-workers.10 Concentrating on the diagnostic pyridine 8a
ν(C–C) mode, bands observed at 1623, 1613, and 1595 cm–1 are assigned to pyridine residing in, respectively,
strong, medium, and weak Lewis acid sites.10 The pyridine 8a mode cannot delineate between medium-strong and
medium-weak Lewis acid sites.10

Figure 1 Infrared difference
spectra for a saturated overlayer of pyridine
on a range of CsCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, (c) 0.1
mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol CsCl
g(cat)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

Figure 1b–e
presents the corresponding IR spectra for pyridine bound to the reference
catalyst doped over the range of 0.01–1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1. Although the spectral frequency of the 8a mode
bandheads is unaffected by the doping process, low concentrations
of CsCl result in an enhancement of signal intensity in the region
of 1700–1400 cm–1. As the group 1 metal salt
loadings are increased further, these intensities begin to decrease. Figure 2 shows this effect
for the CsCl-doped catalysts by plotting the integrated area of all
bands associated with the pyridine 8a mode against the CsCl concentration.
The grouping of the 8a band intensities in this way is intended to
indicate how the bands signifying Lewis acidity scale with respect
to modifier exposure. For CsCl loadings up to 0.4 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, there is an increase in integrated
8a intensity; thereafter, the band intensity is seen to decrease. Section 2.3 outlines a
series of temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) measurements performed
as a function of group 1 metal salt loading that enables the pyridine
coverage as a function of modifier loading to be determined. That
information is included in Figure 2 and shows, as expected, that the surface pyridine
concentration is progressively reduced on increasing CsCl loadings.
Thus, Figure 2 indicates
that there is an intensity enhancement effect for the pyridine 8a
modes that, presumably, is related to the electronic properties of
the modifier and that this effect is nonlinear with respect to pyridine
coverage. This phenomenon is tentatively attributed to the group 1
metal salt by either enhancing the dynamic dipole moment of the 8a
mode of chemisorbed pyridine or inducing a degree of dipole coupling
within the chemisorbed overlayer of oscillators.

Figure 2 Correlation of (a) the
integrated area of the pyridine 8a mode
and (b) integrated area of pyridine TPD profiles (Section 2.3) as a function of CsCl
loading. (An offset in the integrated area of the IR measurement is
connected with the deconvolution of the 8a features in the spectrum.)

Figure 2 indicates
that two competing factors govern the spectral intensity of the probe
molecule. First, there is an enhancement effect induced by the additive
but, second, this is tempered by a decrease in pyridine coverage as
dopant loading increases. Inspection of Figure 2 suggests that, at dopant loadings below
0.3 mmol g(cat)–1, the enhancement effect
is the greater factor, whereas above this value, the decrease in coverage
outweighs any signal enhancement and a decrease in 8a intensities
is observed. These competing factors mean that a direct correlation
between the IR intensity of the pyridine 8a modes with respect to
modifier loading is not readily achievable under these conditions.

Figure 3 presents
the corresponding IR spectra for pyridine-dosed KCl catalysts, while Figure 4 presents the integrated
pyridine 8a intensity profile as a function of KCl loadings that is
additionally plotted alongside the relative TPD-derived pyridine coverage
values. Trends observed for the CsCl-loaded catalysts are essentially
reproduced with the KCl counterparts, most notably including the pyridine
8a mode intensity as a function of group 1 metal salt loading (Figures 2 and 4).

on a range of KCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (c) 0.1 mmol
KCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol KCl g(cat)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

Figure 4 Correlation of (a) the integrated area of the pyridine 8a mode
and (b) the integrated area of pyridine TPD profiles (see Section 2.3) as a function
of KCl loading. (An offset in the integrated area of the IR measurements
is connected with the deconvolution of the 8a features in the spectrum.)

Despite complications arising from group 1 metal
salt doping of
η-alumina leading to the spectral enhancement of the 8a mode
of chemisorbed pyridine, it is still possible to discern, and subsequently
assign, chemically relevant spectral features evident in Figures 1 and 3. In both cases, the 8a mode at 1623 cm–1, assigned to pyridine adsorbed on strong acid sites,10 is effectively removed at loadings of 0.1 mmol
g(cat)–1. Above these levels, it appears
that the dopant has essentially “capped” all of the
strong acid sites. Bands associated with medium and weak Lewis acid
sites remain at all dopant loadings.

The effect of dopant loading
on the medium-strength Lewis acid
sites is difficult to quantify via the 8a mode, both due to the apparent
enhancement effect and to the fact that medium-strong and medium-weak
Lewis acid sites are indistinguishable by IR spectroscopy.10 Certainly, some differences are evident between
the profiles for the CsCl (Figure 1) and KCl (Figure 3) series. To examine these issues further, it is informative
to examine the hydroxyl stretching region of the doped aluminas.

2.1.2 Alumina ν(O–H) Modes
Figures 5 and 6 show the infrared difference spectra recorded in
the region between 3800 and 3650 cm–1 for pyridine
adsorbed on the CsCl- and KCl-doped catalysts, respectively. In both
cases, the infrared spectra show a series of negative bands assigned
to surface hydroxyl groups interacting with pyridine adsorbed on medium-strong,
medium-weak, and weak Lewis acid sites as signified by bands at 3770,
3730, and 3690 cm–1, respectively.10 It is worthwhile noting that the strong Lewis acid site
is a coordinatively unsaturated aluminum ion with no “partner”
hydroxyl group;10 thus, this site has no
signature in the hydroxyl stretching region of the spectrum. The spectral
intensities of the medium-strong and medium-weak sites as a function
of CsCl and KCl loadings are presented in Figure 7, with the two doped catalysts displaying
broadly similar profiles. The band at 3770 cm–1,
assigned to hydroxyl groups interacting with pyridine on medium-strong
Lewis acid sites,10 is attenuated rapidly.
For CsCl, this feature is effectively lost at a dopant level of 0.1
mmol g(cat)–1, whereas in the case of
KCl, a loading of ∼0.3 mmol g(cat)–1 is required to achieve the same outcome, indicating the Cs salt
to be more effective in neutralizing this particular site. Over the
same loading range, there is no observed change in the band at 3730
cm–1 that is associated with medium-weak Lewis acid
sites,10 indicating that the modifier is
selectively blocking stronger acid sites at lower loadings. Thereafter,
on increasing the modifier concentration for both group 1 metal salts
above 0.3 mmol g(cat)–1, the medium-weak
site is rapidly quenched. It appears that the group 1 metal salt loading
is preferentially removing the stronger Lewis acid sites of the η-alumina.
Interestingly, whereas the intensity of the pyridine ν(C–C)
8a modes displays a discontinuous behavior with respect to modifier
loading (Figures 2 and 4), the intensity profiles for the alumina ν(O–H)
modes are effectively continuous (Figure 7). This contrast is thought to reflect the
lower density of hydroxyl groups compared to that of the more close-range
pyridine–metal salt interactions that give rise to the spectral
intensities displayed in Figures 1 and 3.

a saturated overlayer of pyridine on a range of CsCl-doped alumina

g(cat)–1.

Figure 7 Peak heights
of hydroxyl bands associated with the medium-strong
(MS) and medium-weak (MW) Lewis acid sites as a function of the dopant
concentration. The dashed vertical line corresponds to a group 1 metal
salt concentration of 0.3 mmol g(cat)–1.

The pyridine 8a mode trends presented
in Figures 1 and 3 do not correlate
with the deductions arrived at from the inspection of the ν(O–H)
profiles of η-alumina (Figures 5–7). For both dopants,
whereas Figure 7 shows
attenuation of the medium-strong and medium-weak Lewis acid sites
over the range of 0.3–1.0 mmol g (cat)–1, Figures 1 and 3 show that the pyridine 8a mode at 1613 cm–1, assigned to medium-strength Lewis acid sites, remains visible up
to the highest loading examined (1.0 mmol g(cat)–1). In the light of previous measurements involving thermal treatment
of the reference alumina, which indicated good correlation between
pyridine ν(C–C) and alumina ν(O–H) features,10 the discrepancies evident between Figures 1/3 and 5/6 may indicate that there
are additional surface chemical factors in play when group 1 metal
salt modifiers are present. In an attempt to better understand factors
contributing to the pyridine IR data, a series of temperature-programmed
IR experiments were performed. These are described in the following
section.

2.2 Temperature-Programmed
IR Spectroscopy
Further evaluation of the acid site distribution
of the modified
alumina catalysts was obtained from a series of temperature-programmed
infrared measurements. Using this technique, alumina samples could
be heated to induce the selective desorption of pyridine from specific
Lewis acid sites. Previously reported pyridine TPD measurements revealed
the desorption of the medium-strong and medium-weak Lewis acid sites
to exhibit peak maxima at, respectively, 650 and 460 K,10 while temperature-programmed IR measurements
showed the strong Lewis acid site (1623 cm–1) to
remain populated on heating to temperatures of 823 K.10 Specifically, the pyridine 8a mode at 1623 cm–1 lost only ∼14% of its intensity on warming to 823 K at 8
K min–1.10

Figures 8 and 9 show the infrared difference spectra obtained for pyridine
adsorbed on the CsCl- and KCl-modified catalysts, respectively, after
heating to 423 K. With reference to the previous work on the undoped
reference η-alumina catalyst, this temperature corresponds to
the desorption of the majority (∼85%) of pyridine from the
weak Lewis acid site,10 effectively leaving
pyridine in predominantly strong and medium-strength Lewis acid sites.
Reducing the concentration of the weak Lewis acid site assists in
resolving the distribution of pyridine 8a modes, making it clearer
to discern how modifier loading is affecting different sites on the
alumina surface. Figures 8 and 9 show that at low group 1 metal
salt loadings, there are bands at 1623 and 1613 cm–1, assigned to pyridine adsorbed on strong and medium-strength Lewis
acid sites. On addition of 0.1 mmol g(cat)–1 of the group 1 metal salt modifier, the band at 1623 cm–1 is no longer present, indicating the complete removal of this site.

Figure 8 Infrared
spectra of a saturated overlayer of pyridine heated to
423 K on a range of CsCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol CsCl g(alumina)–1, (c)
0.1 mmol CsCl g(alumina)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol
CsCl g(alumina)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol CsCl
g(alumina)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol CsCl g(alumina)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

Figure 9 Infrared spectra of a saturated overlayer of pyridine
heated to
423 K on a range of KCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (c) 0.1 mmol
KCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol KCl g(cat)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

The spectra obtained at 423 K (Figures 8 and 9) do not readily
allow the quantification of the effect of the modifiers on the medium-strength
sites since pyridine remains adsorbed on both sites at this temperature.
By increasing the desorption temperature to 623 K, only pyridine adsorbed
on strong and medium-strong sites will remain due to complete desorption
from the medium-weak site.10Figures 10 and 11 show the infrared spectra after pyridine desorption
at 623 K for the CsCl- and KCl-modified catalysts, respectively. At
low modifier loadings, pyridine 8a bands associated with strong (1623
cm–1) and medium (1613 cm–1) Lewis
acid sites are observed. Concentrating on CsCl, Figure S1 presents the curve fitting of the pyridine 8a peaks
observed in the diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy
DRIFTS spectrum of the η-alumina +0.01 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 sample (Figure 10b). Figure 12a presents the integrated intensity of the pyridine 8a modes
observed in Figure 10. Increasing the modifier loading to 0.1 mmol g(cat)–1 results in the loss of the 8a mode associated with
the strong Lewis acid site. Continued increases in the dopant loading
lead to the attenuation and almost complete removal of the band at
1613 cm–1, indicating the quenching of the medium
site. Thus, these results indicate that a dopant loading of 0.1 mmol
g(cat)–1 is required to completely “cap”
the strong Lewis acid sites, while a loading of ∼0.6 mmol g(cat)–1 is required to effectively remove
medium-strong Lewis acid sites.

overlayer of pyridine
heated to 623 K for a range of CsCl-doped catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,

mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol CsCl
g(cat)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

heated to 623 K for a range of KCl-doped catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (c) 0.1 mmol
KCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.3 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (e) 0.6 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, and (f) 1.0 mmol KCl g(cat)–1. The spectra are offset for clarity.

Figure 12 Integrated intensity of (a) the pyridine 8a peaks and (b) the pyridine
19b peaks observed in Figure 10 (saturated overlayer of pyridine heated to 623 K for CsCl-doped
samples) as a function of CsCl concentration. Dashed vertical lines
signify concentrations of 0.1 and 0.6 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1.

The clarity of the infrared
spectra of the pyridine 8a mode in Figures 10 and 11 relative
to that observed in Figures 1, 3, 8, and 9 is consistent
with the possibility that, within a condensed pyridine overlayer in
the presence of a coadsorbed group 1 metal chloride, dipole coupling
is complicating spectral intensities. In this way, the heating of
a pyridine-dosed sample to 623 K appears to minimize nearest-neighbor
interactions, enabling pyridine spectral intensity to better correlate
with the information contained within the ν(O–H) modes
(e.g., Figure 7).

The differences between Figures 10 and 11 are modest, indicating
that the two group 1 metal salts are operating in a similar manner.
However, the spectra corresponding to a modifier loading of 0.3 mmol
g(cat)–1 (Figures 10d and 11d) do show
a greater attenuation of the medium-strength Lewis acid site for CsCl
compared to that for KCl, a further indication that CsCl is a more
effective neutralizing entity than KCl, possibly due to the larger
size of the CsCl ion pair (Section 3). For completeness, it is noted that a weak feature
at 1575 cm–1 is observed in Figures 10 and 11; this is
assigned to the 8b mode of pyridine bonded to Lewis acid sites.10

The use of temperature-programmed infrared
spectroscopy of a chemisorbed
pyridine overlayer also provides the opportunity to correlate the
pyridine 8a mode with that of the pyridine 19b mode. On the undoped
alumina, Figure 10 shows the latter mode to be characterized by an intense peak centered
at 1449 cm–1 that possesses a high wavenumber shoulder
at ∼1455 cm–1. Figure S2 presents the curve fitting of the pyridine 19b peaks observed
in the DRIFTS spectrum of the η-alumina +0.01 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 sample (Figure 10b). Figure 12b presents the integrated intensity of the pyridine
19b modes observed in Figure 10. At 0.1 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1,
the shoulder completely disappears, leaving an attenuated symmetric
band that is substantially diminished by 0.6 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1. Indeed, the profiles of Figure 12a,b are remarkably similar. In this way,
the weaker feature in Figure 10 at 1455 cm–1 is assigned to pyridine adsorbed
on strong Lewis acid sites, while the distinct band at 1449 cm–1 is attributed to pyridine at medium-strong Lewis
acid sites. The following section uses mass-selective temperature-programmed
desorption experiments of chemisorbed pyridine to further interrogate
the feasibility of using group 1 chlorides to effect site-selective
chemistry.

2.3 Temperature-Programmed
Desorption
A series of pyridine temperature-programmed desorption
(TPD) experiments
were performed on the range of CsCl- and KCl-doped alumina catalysts.
The results obtained from these measurements are shown in Figures 13 and 14. The standard alumina spectrum, used as a reference,
shows two features corresponding to pyridine desorbing from medium-weak
and medium-strong Lewis acid sites.10 At
low dopant loadings, the higher temperature feature associated with
the medium-strong Lewis acid site is gradually lost until by 0.6 mmol
g(cat)–1 it is unobservable. This rather
nicely shows the effect of increasing dopant loading on the medium-strong
site and is entirely consistent with the temperature-programmed pyridine
IR studies (Section 2.2). The low-temperature feature, assigned to the medium-weak Lewis
acid sites,10 remains essentially unaffected
up to 0.3 mmol g(cat)–1, indicating that
the medium-strong site is removed selectively by the addition of low
concentrations of a modifier.

Figure 13 Pyridine TPD profiles obtained for a
saturated chemisorbed dose
on a range of CsCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.01 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, (c) 0.1
mmol CsCl g(cat)–1, (d) 0.6 mmol CsCl
g(cat)–1, and (e) 1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1.

Figure 14 Pyridine
TPD profiles obtained for a saturated chemisorbed dose
on a range of KCl-doped alumina catalysts: (a) undoped η-alumina,
(b) 0.1, (c) 0.3 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, (d)
0.6 mmol KCl g(cat)–1, and (e) 1.0 mmol
KCl g(cat)–1.

These trends are illustrated in Figure 15, which shows the integrated areas of the
features associated with medium-strong and medium-weak sites as a
function of modifier loading. A loading of 0.3 mmol g(cat)–1 appears to mark the point above which it is
possible to remove medium-weak sites, as above this level, a gradual
decrease in the medium-weak feature is observed. Increasing modifier
concentration up to 1.0 mmol g(cat)–1 results in a reduction of the medium-weak feature by ca. 50%. Together,
the IR and TPD results describe a form of “titration”
process, by which medium-strong sites are removed at low dopant loadings,
followed by medium-weak sites as dopant concentrations are increased.
Concentrating on the profile for the medium-weak site in Figure 15, CsCl is more
effective in the neutralization of this site relative to its K counterpart.

3 Discussion
A combination
of infrared spectroscopy with temperature-programmed
desorption studies has allowed an analysis of the effect of group
1 metal salt dopants on the Lewis acidity of reference transition
alumina. It is recognized that there will be a degree of competitive
adsorption between the different Lewis acid sites and the group 1
metal salt modifier. Nonetheless, the preceding data indicate a degree
of quantization of adsorption as a function of modifier loading. Specifically,
IR analysis of the alumina ν(O–H) modes provides information
on the medium-strong and medium-weak Lewis acid sites (Figure 7); temperature-programmed IR
analysis of pyridine 8a and 19b modes provides information on the
strong and medium-strong Lewis acid sites (Figure 12); TPD experiments provide information on
the medium-weak and medium-strong Lewis acid site populations (Figure 15). The temperature-programmed
IR studies circumvent complications with pyridine 8a band intensities,
and the additional analysis of the pyridine 19b mode is consistent
with 8a-derived deductions, thereby signifying a high degree of internal
consistency.

The resulting deductions are outlined in Table 1, which summarizes
the Lewis acid site distribution
at the η-alumina surface after the addition of varying concentrations
of dopants. Although Section 2 shows broadly consistent trends when using the two different
alkali metal chloride modifiers, Figures 7 and 15 indicate that
the effect is slighter greater for CsCl compared with that for KCl.

The perspective gleaned
from this analysis of the surface Lewis
acid site distribution of η-alumina as a function of modifier
loading is illustrated schematically in Figure 16. As considered previously,10 the clean activated η-alumina surface is composed
of (i) strong, (ii) medium-strong, (iii) medium-weak, and (iv) weak
Lewis acid sites; this situation is represented by Figure 16a. Concentrating on CsCl as
a representative dopant and considering the case for a high dopant
coverage (1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1), Figure 16b shows the modifier
to have completely neutralized the strong and medium-strong Lewis
acid sites while partially reducing the density of medium-weak Lewis
acid sites. Thus, the active surface of a group 1 metal chloride-doped
η-alumina is composed of weak Lewis acid sites and a reduced
population of medium-weak Lewis acid sites. It is the combination
of sites presented in Figure 16b that defines the active phase of a group 1 metal salt-doped
η-alumina catalyst that conveys acceptable rates of methyl chloride
formation and negligible rates of dimethyl ether production. While
it is acknowledged that this spectroscopic investigation demonstrates
fair coherence to the titration concept where group 1 metal salts
can affect site-selective chemistry, this study is inherently limited
to internal validation. However, external validation for the trends
outlined here is evidenced by the enhanced catalytic performance recently
reported for this new generation of a methyl chloride synthesis catalyst.17

Figure 16 Schematic representation of (a) an activated η-alumina
surface
and (b) η-alumina doped with varying levels of CsCl modifier.
The dashed line corresponds to a dopant level of 0.1 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 that neutralizes the strong Lewis
acid sites; the thin solid line corresponds to a dopant level of 0.6
mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 that neutralizes the
strong and medium-strong Lewis acid sites; the thick solid line corresponds
to a dopant level of 1.0 mmol CsCl g(cat)–1 that neutralizes the strong and medium-strong Lewis acid sites and
a proportion of the medium-weak Lewis acid sites.

Finally, we briefly consider possible origins for the differences
induced by KCl and CsCl dopings. Previous work by Baird et al. has
reported on interactions between cesium and potassium fluoride islands
on γ alumina, which considers a role for ion pairs in the surface
chemistry, i.e., K+F– or Cs+F–.22 It is possible
that the CsCl and KCl dopants considered in the present study are
present at the surface as ion-pair islands. This scenario then leads
to possibilities of how differences in the cation, e.g., cation size
and consequent interionic difference, may influence base activity.
KCl adopts the face-centered cubic rock salt structure (a = 6.2931 Å), whereas CsCl adopts a simple cubic structure (a = 4.123 Å).23 Thus, it
is possible that the consistently more potent attenuation of Lewis
acid sites of CsCl compared to that of KCl, as evidenced in Figures 7 and 15, could be a reflection of the local structure of the two
modifiers. This suggestion is speculative and constitutes a topic
worthy of further investigation.

4 Conclusions
This work has used a combination of pyridine chemisorption coupled
to infrared spectroscopy and temperature-programmed desorption measurements
to examine how the addition of group 1 metal chlorides can modify
the acid site distribution of an η-alumina catalyst. The following
conclusions can be drawn:A
group 1 metal chloride loading of 0.1 mmol g(cat)–1 is sufficient to neutralize the strong Lewis
acid sites. Figures 1, 3, 8, and 9 justify this statement.

A group 1 metal chloride loading of 0.6 mmol g(cat)–1 is sufficient to neutralize the strong and medium-strong
Lewis acid sites. Figures 7, 10, 11, and 15 justify this statement.

A group 1 metal chloride loading of 1.0 mmol g(cat)–1 neutralizes the strong and medium-strong Lewis
acid sites and partially neutralizes the medium-weak Lewis acid site. Figures 13, 14, and 15 justify this statement.

The loading of a group 1 metal chloride
can act as a
titrant that enables selective neutralization of the distribution
of Lewis acid sites present at the surface of an η-alumina catalyst.

At a group 1 metal chloride loading of 1.0
mmol g(cat)–1, the surface is characterized
by
a distribution of medium-weak and weak Lewis acid sites; these sites
define the active phase of a methyl chloride synthesis catalysis that
is highly selective to methyl chloride production. Figure 16b presents a schematic illustration
of the η-alumina surface during this phase of operation.



5 Experimental Section
5.1 Catalyst Preparation
The η-alumina
reference catalyst was supplied by Ineos Chlor (Ineos Chlor catalyst
ref: 25867); this is the same transition alumina examined in the previous
studies11−14 and has been comprehensively characterized elsewhere.10 The doping of the alumina catalyst with K and
Cs salts was performed by an impregnation method. An aqueous solution
of CsCl (Sigma-Aldrich, purity 99.9%) or KCl (Sigma-Aldrich, purity
99.999%) of precalculated concentration was added to a Pyrex flask
via a two-way adaptor and a dropping funnel while under vacuum (<10–2 Torr). The use of an evacuated vessel ensured that
the salt solution entered and filled the pores of the alumina in a
uniform fashion. The solution was decanted to remove excess liquid,
and the catalyst was dried by rotary evaporation at 343 K for 2 h,
before final drying in an oven at 353 K for a further 2 h. Varying
the concentration of the original salt solution enabled the base η-alumina
catalyst to be prepared with a range of group 1 metal salt dopant
concentrations. As an indication for how the dopant loading affects
the structure/porosity of the alumina, Table 2 provides the surface area and pore volume
values for the reference catalyst and five CsCl-doped samples (0.01–1.0
mmol CsCl g(cat)–1).

Table 2 shows that
increasing CsCl loadings lead to reductions in the total surface area,
as well as pore volume.

5.2 Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared experiments
were performed using a Nicolet Nexus Fourier transform infrared spectrometer
fitted with an MCT high D* detector. Measurements were performed in
diffuse reflectance mode using a SpectraTech Smart diffuse reflectance
cell and environmental chamber, using a typical sample size of 50
mg of the catalyst. Background spectra were recorded post activation
at 293 K. Pyridine was dosed onto the catalyst at 373 K using pulse-flow
techniques. The elevated temperature prevented the retention of physisorbed
pyridine and resulted in a chemisorbed layer on alumina. After dosing,
the sample temperature was allowed to cool to 293 K and then the spectrum
was recorded (128 scans, resolution 2 cm–1). All
spectra are presented as background subtractions, where a spectrum
of the activated catalyst has been subtracted from the dosed catalyst
spectrum. No baseline or offset corrections were made. For pyridine
desorption experiments, the cell containing alumina, previously dosed
with pyridine as above, was heated under flowing He. The cell was
maintained at each temperature for 15 min and allowed to cool down
to room temperature, and then a spectrum was recorded. The alumina
is retained in the η-phase under these conditions. Infrared
peak areas were determined using a Gaussian fitting function available
within the Origin graphical software package.

5.3 Temperature-Programmed
Desorption
Thermal desorption experiments were performed
with the catalyst sample
(ca. 0.1 g) contained within a packed bed tubular reactor (1/4 in.
stainless steel tubing) located within a temperature-programmable
oven (Neytech 25 PAF). A mass spectrometer (Leda Mass Gas Analyzer,
LM22, closed-ion source) sampled the eluting gases via a differentially
pumped capillary line and a metal-sintered precision leak. The alumina
sample was activated and dosed with pyridine as outlined above, using
high-purity helium as the carrier gas. Saturation of the sample could
be observed by monitoring the pyridine breakthrough in the eluent
stream on the mass spectrometer. When saturation was achieved, the
sample was left to purge overnight at 373 K under a flowing He. This
resulted in the selective desorption of weakly bound pyridine.10 Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) runs
were carried out using the temperature-programmable oven, set at a
heating rate of 8 K min–1. The eluent stream from
the reactor was monitored by the mass spectrometer at all times during
the TPD experiment. To ensure the rapid transition of desorbing species
through the mass spectrometer pumping system, the split valve for
the elutant feedline into the mass spectrometer was set such that
the majority of the desorbing gases were passed to the vent. While
this arrangement facilitates good peak resolution in the TPD profiles,
it does lead to relatively low signal : noise ratio plots. All IR
and TPD measurements have been performed at least in duplicate, with
the profiles presented here being representative of the observed trends.
