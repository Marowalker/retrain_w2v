The emergence of innovative surgical
procedures using partial thickness
corneal transplant has created a need for the development of corneal
grafts to replace pathologic corneal tissue. Corneal repair materials
have been successfully prepared in the past 10 years, but they were
difficult to be used in clinics because of the unbearable tension
caused by interrupted suture during routine surgery. However, polycaprolactone
(PCL), a medical polymer material, can solve this problem. Therefore,
a hierarchical collagen (Col)-based corneal graft with curvature,
consisting of a transparent core part composed of collagen in the
center and a mechanically robust fixed part containing collagen and
polycaprolactone in the edge, was used as a potential corneal graft
for corneal repair and regeneration in this study. The hierarchical
collagen-based corneal grafts [collagen–polycaprolactone (Col–PCL)
membranes] that are capable of mimicking the native cornea were developed
based on chemical and thermal crosslinking mechanisms. The water adsorption
of Col–PCL membranes could reach over 80% similar to that of
human cornea, and its swelling could reach over 400%. More importantly,
the formed Col–PCL membranes could resist a larger tensile
strength (1.1 ± 0.03 MPa) before rupturing in comparison with
pure collagen membranes and polycaprolactone membranes. Furthermore,
the biodegradable Col–PCL membranes could facilitate cell adhesion
and proliferation as well as cell migration (exhibiting epithelial
wound coverage in <5 days), which showed promise as corneal grafts
for cornea tissue engineering.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Cornea is a delicate tissue
that are crucial for normal vision.
Different from many other tissues, cornea is an avascular, hierarchical,
and transparent tissue on the surface of human eyes.1 Damage from mechanical, thermal, or chemical injuries and
microbial infections frequently leads to the dysfunction of cornea,
resulting in the appearance of grayish-white opacification in the
transparent cornea, vision loss, and even blindness.2−4 At present, the donor corneal graft is a widely accepted therapeutic
method because of its accessibility and immune privilege.1 However, donors are inadequate and difficult
to match patients.5 The emergence of innovative
surgical procedures using partial thickness corneal transplants has
created a need for the development of corneal grafts to replace pathologic
corneal tissue. This procedure has been called anterior lamellar keratoplasty
(ALKP).6−8 Therefore, many researchers have attempted to develop
corneal grafts using natural macromolecule materials to replace pathologic
corneal tissue via ALKP.1,9 The corneal stroma,
which accounts for approximately 90% of the cornea, mainly composes
of aligned collagen (Col) I fibrils and quiescent keratocytes.10−12 Bionic corneal structures are the key to the development of successful
corneal products. In addition, the cornea repair materials should
possess good biocompatibility and nutrition permeability, appropriate
optical performance and mechanical strength.13−15 Although many
cornea repair materials have been successfully obtained in a variety
of ways,1,9,14−19 the main problem is that they are difficult to apply in the clinical
suture.

Collagen (Col), a natural biopolymer, is used widely
as a biomaterial
in medical areas, with biocompatibility, biodegradability, and biological
activity,20−24 which makes Col possible to be excellent candidates for the tissue
repair material. Meanwhile, it is also the main component of corneal
stroma. However, the poor mechanical toughness and elasticity limited
its clinical application in our previous work.16,17,25,26 Therefore,
Col is often accompanied by other materials to counteract its poor
mechanical properties. Another material which was successfully used
in tissue repair and functional reconstruction, showing good results,
was polycaprolactone (PCL).27−31 PCL is a hydrophobic and semicrystalline polymer, exhibiting more
advantages, including versatile mechanical performance, slower degradation
rate, and lesser inflammation.27,32,33 These advantages have a potential significance on the biomedical
applications of PCL, such as sutures and fixation devices.34−37 However, it still has its own limitations, such as high hydrophobicity,
poor cell attachment, and proliferation. To solve these limitations,
Ma’s team reported on biocomposites of both synthetic and natural
polymers that can be identified and metabolized in the biological
environment.38

In previous work,
collagen as a cornea repair material could hardly
bear interrupted stitching during routine surgery,39,40 which limited its clinical application. In this study, our aim is
to solve the problem of low mechanical strength and difficult suture
in cornea transplant operation. Col–PCL membranes were prepared
using chemical crosslinking and thermal crosslinking methods during
membrane formation, consisting of a transparent core part composed
of collagen in the center and a mechanically robust fixed part containing
collagen and PCL in the edge. The fixed part is convenient for suturing
during operation. After the preparation of Col–PCL membranes,
the physical properties of the membranes were characterized in optical
transparency, water content, and tensile strength. The in vitro cytocompatibility
of the membranes to human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) was evaluated.
Finally, the in vitro ability of re-epithelialization has been examined
using an ex vivo corneal graft culture model.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Macroscopic and Microscopic
Morphology Characteristics
Because of the special structure
of corneal stroma, designing corneal
structure is the key to the development of a successful corneal product
to repair a corneal anterior lamellar defect. In this study, a rehydrated
Col–PCL composite membrane with curvature and transmittance
was successfully prepared (Figure 1) and is shown in Figure 2A. It consisted of a transparent core part
composed of collagen in the center and a mechanically robust fixed
part containing Col and PCL in the edge. The core part provided optical
performance for vision, and the fixed part provided interrupted suture
during surgery. Figure 2E shows the surface of a dry Col–PCL membrane, which presented
a lower and smoother core part composed of Col and a higher and rough
fixed part composed of Col–PCL, but the core part and fixed
part had the same plane after absorbing water. A lamellar structure
similar to native cornea was discovered in Figure 2B,C,F,G. The Col–PCL membrane (Figure 2C,G) had a small
amount of reconstructive PCL that showed a dense structure compared
to the Col membrane (Figure 2B,F). At 120°, liquid PCL infiltrated into the collagen
membrane. The PCL infiltrating into collagen provides mechanical properties
for the surgical suture, which is mainly due to the mechanical properties
of PCL itself. After returning to room temperature, PCL existed in
the form of a reconstructive solid state. Group PCL exposed a dense
structure (Figure 2D,H), which was not conducive to air permeability and nutrient transport.
Interestingly, the dense structure was similar to where indicated
by the red arrow in Figure 2C,G. Although a dense structure similar to PCL appears, it
was small and did not affect air permeability and nutrient transport
of the material itself. Therefore, a small amount of the reconstructive
PCL may be more suitable for this study.

2.2 Physical Characterization
Transparency
is critical to the functionality of corneal grafts and is related
to the collagen organization, which contributes to the transparency
with its water-retaining proteoglycans.41,42 Clinically,
the degree of corneal injury is different for each patient, so corneal
grafts should be of different thickness and size for patients to choose.
All dry membranes in this study were about 40 ± 5 μm. Col
membranes as a positive control represented the core part of the Col–PCL
membrane, which had higher transparency values than the fixed part
of Col–PCL membranes (Figure 3A). The fixed part of dry Col–PCL membranes
with 40 μm thickness was 60% transparent at 780 nm and the fixed
part of wet Col–PCL membranes with 400 μm thickness was
only 42% transparent at 780 nm, because their internal structure was
damaged after swelling. Therefore, it is impossible to achieve minimal
functional transparency at a thickness of human corneal thickness
with these grafts. Importantly, it only provides surgical suture,
not vision. However, the core part of Col–PCL membranes was
the Col with 40 μm thickness, which was 90% transparent at 780
nm in a dry environment. Within the same 400 μm thickness, wet
Col membranes were 78% transparent at 780 nm. The transparency of
Col membranes in the visible range was lower than that of native cornea
(87%),43 but it was observed that the transmittance
of the membranes increased gradually in our long-term in vivo experiments.

(SD), n = 3, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01.

The cornea is a water-bearing
tissue with moisture retention capacity.
Before surgery, the corneal grafts will be rehydrated until it reaches
saturation. After rehydration for 60 min, the quality of PCL membranes
remained constant because of its hydrophobicity (Figure 3B); the saturation curves of
Col and Col–PCL membranes had a common feature that was oversaturated
(10–30 min) before reaching stable saturation (30–60
min). Therefore, the corneal grafts only need to be rehydrated 30
min before surgery. Moreover, quality of Col membranes after rehydration
was higher than Col–PCL membranes, which was mainly due to
the higher content of Col in Col membranes.

The water adsorption
and swelling properties play an important
role in maintaining the structural stability of corneal grafts, which
is in favor of cell migration, adhesion, and proliferation. To further
evaluate the physical properties of Col, Col–PCL, and PCL membranes,
water adsorption and swelling were characterized because they can
judge the hydrophilic properties of materials. After 24 h of incubation
in NS, the water adsorption of Col and Col–PCL membranes could
reach over 80%, while those of PCL membranes were only less than 20%
(Figure 3C) and there
were significant differences between them, but there was no significant
difference between Col and Col–PCL. Therefore, Col and Col–PCL
membranes demonstrated similar water adsorption to human cornea (78–82%).15 Furthermore, the swelling of Col, Col–PCL,
and PCL membranes was measured under the same conditions. The swelling
of Col and Col–PCL membranes could reach over 400%, while those
of PCL membranes were only less than 30% (Figure 3D). No significant difference was observed
in Col and Col–PCL, but there were significant differences
between them and PCL. Therefore, Col–PCL membranes with excellent
moisture retention capacity can maintain water balance and provide
a water environment for cell adhesion and proliferation.

Besides
the above-mentioned transparency and swelling properties,
the mechanical properties of corneal grafts also play an important
role in surgical suture.44 Therefore, the
mechanical properties were characterized using a method of the simulated
tension of suture during surgery. The native corneas usually underwent
environmental shear or tensile stress resulting from the blink and
the intraocular pressures.45 Furthermore,
surgical implantation of a corneal graft requires tensile strength
to support suturelike native tissue. Therefore, the tensile properties
of Col–PCL membranes were tested and compared with Col and
PCL. An engineered suture pull-out test (Figure 3F) found that Col–PCL membranes could
withstand a larger tensile strength (1.1 ± 0.03 MPa) than Col
and PCL membranes before rupturing and the differences were significant
(Figure 3E). The results
showed that the mechanical properties of Col membranes were enhanced
by the melted PCL, and the tensile strength of Col–PCL membranes
was close to the sum of Col and PCL. Meanwhile, the results suggested
that they have the potential to bear routine interrupted suture in
clinics.

2.3 In Vitro Degradation
Controllable
corneal graft degradation kinetics are also very crucial for the regeneration
of cornea. It would be beneficial if the implanted corneal graft is
degraded and replaced by normal cornea tissue.15 Col is usually degraded by collagenase, which is present
in tear films.46 To investigate the degradation
time of the prepared corneal grafts in vitro, the membranes were incubated
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.017 ng/mg of collagenase
type I at 37 °C. Figure 4 depicts the degradation profiles of all membranes (Col, Col–PCL,
and PCL) with different incubation times. After continuous incubation
for 8 h, the Col membrane lost nearly half of its mass and degraded
the most. This may be because the reconstructive PCL prevents the
rapid degradation of Col. After 24 h, the mass of Col membranes remained
20.45%, Col–PCL membranes remained 13.86%, and PCL membranes
did not change. Col–PCL membranes stabilized in 24 h, and the
quality remained unchanged in the following time. Moreover, Col membranes
could maintain degradation for 48 h; Col–PCL membranes could
maintain degradation for 24 h; and PCL membranes could not degrade.
Therefore, the enzymatic degradation of the membranes suggests that
PCL with slow degradation is feasible as a fixing part and that may
be used for biomedical applications.

Col–PCL, and PCL
membranes.

2.4 Cell
Proliferation and Adhesion
Cell
proliferation and adhesion are essential for corneal grafts;47,48 thus, cell proliferation and adhesion assay were carried out on
the as-prepared membranes. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) kit was used
to quantificationally estimate the proliferation and adhesion of HCECs
as shown in Figure 5A,B. In cell proliferation experiments, the proliferation rate of
cells on the three membranes was close to each other after 5 days
of culture and there were no significant differences. At day 3, the
proliferation rate of cells on PCL membranes was the lowest compared
to that of Col and Col–PCL membranes due to the low adhesion
rate of PCL. However, the cell proliferation rates of all membranes
were lower than that of the control group, because some cells floated
on the cell culture plate when planting cells. Moreover, optical density
(OD) values increased with the incubation time. To evaluate the cell
adhesion of Col–PCL membranes, the OD values of HCECs remaining
on the membrane after washing with PBS are plotted in Figure 5B. After incubation for 1 day,
the cell adhesion on the three membranes was different and there were
no significant differences between them. However, there was a significant
difference between the control group and PCL membranes. The results
indicated that PCL membranes have relatively poor cell adhesion, which
is consistent with the results of cell proliferation. To further evaluate
cell adhesion of the three membranes, the cell morphology adhered
to the membranes was obtained by SEM (Figure 5C). Compared with PCL membranes, HCECs could
spread well with a fibroblastic morphology. All of these results were
consistent with the quantification of HCECs to estimate their proliferation
and adhesion and illustrated the potential use of Col–PCL membranes
for tissue engineering applications.

PCL membranes. (A) Cell proliferation of Col, Col–PCL, and
PCL membranes for day 1, 3, and 5. (B) Number of HCECs adhering to
membranes for 1 day. (C) SEM images from HCECs adhering to membranes.
Data are means ± SD, n = 3, ***p < 0.001, **p < 0.01.

2.5 Live/Dead Cell Viability Assay
Studying
the impact of the membrane on HCEC viability is of great interest
to biocompatibility of membranes. To perform the assay, HCECs were
used to evaluate cell viability on the membranes by means of calcein
acetoxymethyl (calcein-AM)/propidium iodide (PI) double staining performed
at 5 days (Figure 6). HCECs adhering to the membranes were homogenously distributed
and retained high cell viability over 5 days postculture (Figure 6A). In addition,
minimal cell death was shown in all groups. At the same magnification,
the cell adhesion area on the PCL membrane was significantly smaller
than that on Col and Col–PCL membranes. These results were
consistent with the cell adhesion experiments in Figure 5B,C. Cell viability in different
groups was quantified using ImageJ. All membranes showed nearly 100%
cell viability, and there were no significant differences.

2.6 Ex Vivo
Cell Migration
Epithelial
cells maintain a balance between limbal stem function, tear quantity
and quality, eyelid anatomy and function, and corneal sensitivity.49 Although various corneal materials have been
reported to promote corneal tissue repair, challenges remain in epithelialization
of corneal grafts. There are also other important differences between
in vitro and ex vivo approaches. Compared with the traditional cell
culture, the intact eyeball contains several cell types with different
properties and functions. It is expected that these cells communicate
with each other, thus interactively influencing their behavior during
wound healing. This might be mediated via secreted cytokines or proteins.
Although ex vivo approaches have the advantage of avoiding painful
treatments of animals and have been applied with significant success,50−52 such an experimental method has the disadvantage of systemic circulation.
Even though ex vivo models are limited by clinical transformation,
it has also shown the applicability of the cell migration experiment.
The migration of HCECs on Col–PCL membranes was assessed on
the basis of the ex vivo corneal graft culture model, to ensure that
Col–PCL membranes support cell growth and migration without
adding any exogenous cells. As shown in Figure 7, a clear corneal defect model was established
in ex vivo rabbit eye and the Col–PCL membrane was successfully
sutured on the rabbit cornea in the experimental group. On day 3,
a larger area of re-epithelization appeared in the Col–PCL
membrane compared to the control group. More interestingly, re-epithelialization
of Col–PCL membranes completed at 5 days postculture compared
to the control group, characterized by fluorescein staining. The results
demonstrated that HCECs could migrate and cover over the implant region.

wound healing over 5 days. Yellow-green staining under blue light

3 Conclusions
In conclusion, corneal
grafts (Col–PCL membranes) with curvature,
transparency, and robust tensile stress were engineered using chemical
crosslinking and thermal crosslinking methods during membrane formation.
These corneal grafts display a lamellar structure that are capable
of simulating the native cornea, which consists of a transparent core
part in the center and a mechanically robust fixed part in the edge.
The fixed PCL part can improve the suture tension during surgery and
bear interrupted suture in routine surgery. Moreover, Col–PCL
membranes could facilitate HCEC adhesion, proliferation, and migration
in vitro. Therefore, the prepared Col–PCL membranes dramatically
increase the choice of artificial corneal grafts for the regeneration
of cornea.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Collagen extracted from
bovine tendon was supplied by Pudao Lianxin Biotech, Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou,
China). PCL (Mw 40 kDa) was purchased
from Haishan Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhan, China). The CCK-8 kit was
purchased from Dojindo Laboratories (Japan). Fetal bovine serum (FBS),
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH = 7.4), and Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle’s medium (DMEM)-basic (1×) was provided from Gibco. N-(3-Dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (≥98.0%) (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide
(98.0%) (NHS) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China).
Collagenase I from clostridium histolyticum was supplied by QiYun
Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Guangzhou, China). Sodium fluorescein ophthalmic
test papers were purchased from Tianjin Jingming New Technology Development
Co., Ltd. (China, Tianjin). All other chemical reagents were of analytical
grade and obtained from commercial sources.

4.2 Preparation
of Col and Col–PCL Membranes
Col membranes were prepared
as described in a previously published
protocol.53 In short, the crosslinking
agents EDC and NHS were added to 6.5 mg/mL Col solution in 0.01 M
HCl with a mass ratio of Col/(EDC/NHS) = 6:1 and stirred slowly at
4 °C for 8 h, in which the molar ratio of EDC to NHS was 4 to
1. After fully crosslinking, the homogeneous mixture was returned
to room temperature and centrifuged to remove bubbles, following which
the resulting mixture was poured into a disposable culture dish and
air-dried in a clean bench. After washing, the air-dried membranes
were put into a vacuum drying oven for thermal crosslinking. In this
study, EDC/NHS is used to activate the carbonyl group when an amide
bond is formed and generate synthetic crosslinks that form a bridge
between amino acids without affecting any chemistry to the collagen
molecule.54 The preparation process of
Col–PCL membranes is shown in Figure 1. Briefly, Col from fresh bovine tendon was
dissolved in 0.01 M HCl solution at 4 °C, and the final concentration
of Col was determined to be 6.5 mg/mL. The formed Col solution was
then crosslinked by EDC and NHS, in which the molar ratio for the
EDC to NHS was 4:1, and the Col to EDC/NHS mass ratio was 6:1. The
EDC-mediated coupling reaction proceeded at 4 °C with stirring
for 8 h. After the reaction was complete, the resulting mixture was
placed at room temperature for 4 h and then centrifuged to remove
bubbles. Immediately, the precursor solution was dispensed into a
disposable culture dish and air-dried in a clean bench. PCL rings
(outer diameter, 10 mm; inner diameter, 5 mm; thickness, 30–50
μm) were obtained by dissolution with dichloromethane, air drying,
and tailoring. The obtained PCL ring was pressed into a part of the
precursor solution until Col–PCL membranes are formed by air
drying. The obtained Col and Col–PCL membranes were rinsed
with deionized water five times to remove salt from the membrane.
After the membranes were air-dried again, they were then put into
a specific mold and hot-pressed in a vacuum drying oven for 24 h at
120 °C.55 The obtained Col and Col–PCL
membranes were stored in a desiccator for further characterization.

4.3 Macroscopic and Microscopic Morphology of
the Membranes
The macroscopic morphology of the membranes
was obtained by a digital camera, and the hierarchical structure was
imaged using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (Philips
Electronics N.V. Holland, SEM). Prior to the observation, the prepared
membrane was quickly fractured in liquid nitrogen to observe the sectional
morphology; the formed cross-section was then sputter-coated with
platinum for observation.

4.4 Physical Characterization
Following
immersion in normal saline (NS) for 2.5 h, transparency of the dry
and wet membranes was determined by an ultraviolet–visible
spectrophotometer (UNICO, China) at room temperature with the spectral
range from 380 to 780 nm.

Water saturation was determined by
the weight of the membranes and absorbed NS at different time points.
Considering the small mass of the membranes, three homologous membranes
were set to a sample and each batch was performed in triplicate. The
equilibrated water content of the membranes was measured by the following
steps. First, the membranes were weighed (W0) and immersed in NS for 24 h at 37 °C. Subsequently, the membranes
were taken out from the NS and the superficial NS was removed with
filter papers and then weighed (W). The swelling
ratio and water adsorption of the membranes were determined using
the following equations 1   2  Tensile testing was performed on
materials
using DMA (Instron Corporation, Issaquah, WA) with a load velocity
of 0.05 mm/s. In this study, the suture tension during surgery was
simulated. To be brief, in the symmetrical position of the membranes,
10.0 suture was used to sew in the designated position, and then clamped
in the fixture to pull. The maximum tension of the membrane is recorded.

4.5 In Vitro Degradation Experiment
Considering
the weight of the membranes, two membranes with a diameter of 10 mm
were defined as a sample. After samples (W0) and 70 μm cell filters (W1) were
weighed respectively, the samples were put into the cell filters,
and then the cell filters with samples were placed in collagenase
type I solution (0.017 ng/mL). The cell filters with samples were
removed from collagenase type I solution every 8 h, dried with filter
paper, and weighed (W2). The residual
quality of samples in collagenase type I solution was calculated by
the following equations 3  

4.6 Cell
Proliferation and Adhesion Assay
Cell proliferation onto
the membranes was assessed by the CCK-8 kit.
Briefly, the samples sterilized by UV were put into sterile 48-well
plates with DMEM-basic (1×) for 4 h and pressed into the bottom
of well plates by sterile rubber rings to prevent it from floating
in the liquid. Immediately after removing DMEM-basic (1×), HCECs
(5 × 103) were seeded per sample and incubated in
DMEM-basic (1×) supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.
The proliferative capacity was determined at day 1, 3, and 5. After
adding CCK-8 reagent for 4 h, the absorbance of the collected supernatant
medium at 450 nm was tested with a microplate reader (Thermo 3001,
America).

Similarly, HCECs were seeded per sample and incubated
for 24 h to evaluate cell adhesion on the samples. The CCK-8 assay
on the basis of the manufacturer’s instruction was used for
quantitative analysis of the samples. In short, the surface of samples
with HCECs was rinsed with PBS thrice after incubation for 24 h. Like
cell proliferation, the samples with HCECs were incubated with the
CCK-8 reagent for 4 h, and the absorbance of the collected supernatant
at 450 nm was measured by a microplate reader. In addition, the samples
with HCECs were rinsed with PBS thrice and immobilized with 2.5% polyformaldehyde
(v/v) for 30 min at 4 °C, followed by sequential dehydration
and drying. The samples were sputter-coated with platinum, and the
cell status and morphology adhered to the sample were assessed using
SEM.

4.7 Determination of Cell Viability
The
calcein acetoxymethyl (calcein-AM)/(propidium iodide) PI double stain
kit (Dojindo Laboratories, Japan) was employed to determine the viability
of HCECs on the membranes for 5 days.56 Briefly, calcein-AM (2 μmol/L) was diluted in absolute DMSO
and PI (4 μmol/L) was diluted in ddH2O to form the
staining solution. Col, Col–PCL, and PCL membranes of 10 mm
diameter were placed into 48-well plates. HCECs were seeded onto the
surface of the membranes at a density of 1 × 104 cells
per membrane (n = 3). Cells seeded at similar density
on tissue culture plastic served as a control. After incubation at
37 °C for 5 days, cell medium was removed from wells and then
the wells were rinsed with PBS thrice. Immediately after adding 100
μL of staining solution, cell-seeded membranes were incubated
for 15 min at 37 °C, in the dark. After PBS washing, live (green
stain) and dead (red stain) cells were imaged using a confocal laser
scanning microscope (Leica TCS SP8). Finally, cell viability was quantified
by the proportion of live cells to total cells, using ImageJ software.

4.8 Ex Vivo Cell Migration
All experimental
procedures followed the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology
(ARVO) Statement that permits the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and
Vision Research, as well as the local ethical rules. Rabbit eyes were
obtained from New Zealand white rabbits of euthanasia. Corneal grafts
(Col–PCL membranes) of 7.25 mm diameter were surgically implanted
into an isolated corneal anterior lamellar defect model (anterior
wound diameter 7 mm). The samples were cultured in complete medium
for 5 days. Re-epithelialization was tracked using sodium fluorescein
ophthalmic test papers.

4.9 Statistical Analysis
Samples of at
least n = 3 were used for data analysis. All data
were presented as means ± standard deviations and statistical
difference (p value) and analyzed using one-way analysis
of variance. p < 0.05 was defined as statistically
significant and marked with an asterisk.
