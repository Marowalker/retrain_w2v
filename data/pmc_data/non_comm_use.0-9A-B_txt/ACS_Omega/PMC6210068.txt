While screening off-target
effects of rigid (N)-methanocarba-adenosine 5′-methylamides
as A3 adenosine
receptor (AR) agonists, we discovered μM binding hits at the
δ-opioid receptor (DOR) and translocator protein (TSPO). In
an effort to increase OR and decrease AR affinity by structure activity
analysis of this series, antagonist activity at κ-(K)OR appeared
in 5′-esters (ethyl 24 and propyl 30), which retained TSPO interaction (μM). 7-Deaza modification
of C2-(arylethynyl)-5′-esters but not 4′-truncation
enhanced KOR affinity (MRS7299 28 and 29, Ki ≈ 40 nM), revealed μ-OR
and DOR binding, and reduced AR affinity. Molecular docking and dynamics
simulations located a putative KOR binding mode consistent with the
observed affinities, placing C7 in a hydrophobic region. 3-Deaza modification
permitted TSPO but not OR binding, and 1-deaza was permissive to both;
ribose-restored analogues were inactive at both. Thus, we have repurposed
a known AR nucleoside scaffold for OR antagonism, with a detailed
hypothesis for KOR recognition.

==== Body
Introduction
Nucleoside analogues
containing a bicyclo[3.1.0]hexane ring system
(termed methanocarba, Chart 1) in place of ribose are being developed as highly selective
A3 adenosine receptor (AR) agonists, which have potential
in treatment of chronic neuropathic pain and other conditions.1,2 The position of cyclopropyl and cyclopentyl ring fusion enforces
a South (S) or a North (N) envelope conformation, which we previously
showed to promote A3AR interaction.2,3 This
rigid scaffold shows promise as a privileged but not promiscuous structural
class for interaction with diverse protein targets.4 Varied off-target effects of these nucleosides at biogenic
amine receptors, including as 5HT2B and 5HT2C serotonin receptor antagonists, and as allosteric modulators of
the dopamine transporter (DAT), were detected at higher concentrations
than their nM affinities at the A3AR. Moreover, it was
possible to enhance these novel activities, while at the same time
deselecting for AR affinity.5,6

Chart 1 Rigid (N)-Methanocarba
Nucleosides with Reported Off-Target Activity
at rTSPO24a
a All
three nucleosides lack significant
binding affinity at the hKOR. N6-(3-Chlorobenzyl)
derivative 4 also activates the human (h) A3AR (Ki = 3 nM), and corresponding 4′-truncated
derivative 3 is an A3AR antagonist (Ki = 100 nM).



We report
here that certain (N)-methanocarba nucleosides can also
antagonize opioid receptors (ORs): δ- (DOR), κ- (KOR),
and μ- (MOR), with moderate preference for KOR. We probed the
structure–activity relationship (SAR) of rigid bicyclic nucleosides
to enhance KOR affinity and modeled their receptor interactions. We
have also proposed a structural basis for the unexpected interaction
of rigid nucleosides with the KOR, especially 7-deaza analogues,7,8 utilizing modeling approaches that complement published reports
on KOR modeling.9−11 We also observed a partial SAR convergence with the
translocator protein (TSPO), but this was not the target of the present
study. The affinity at TSPO and DOR was noted previously for a few
(N)-methanocarba adenosine derivatives.4 For example, the N6-dicyclopropylmethyl 5′-ester derivatives 1 and 2 displayed roughly μM affinity at TSPO, while also
binding to A1AR and A3AR.5 Other rigid bicyclic nucleosides, 3 and 4, with enlarged substituents at the N6 and C2
positions were shown to bind at TSPO as well, and compound 4 also bound weakly at DOR.4

High-affinity
antagonists of KOR have been reported, including
both morphinans and non-morphinans.10,12−15 Centrally active KOR antagonists, including those containing novel
scaffolds and having shorter half-lives in vivo, are sought for the
treatment of mood disorders, drug addiction, pain, and depression
resulting from chronic stress.16,17 KOR activation by the
native peptide dynorphin in the amygdala inhibits presynaptic glutamate
release, and its deletion or blockade with selective antagonists produces
an anxiolytic phenotype.18 KOR activation
impeded lung cancer cell growth through activation of glycogen synthase
kinase 3β.19 MOR antagonists may
be applied to addiction treatment and to reducing side effects of
opioid pain killers when their action is peripherally restricted.20−22 TSPO, an off-target interaction of many of nucleosides in this chemical
series, is a component of the permeability transition pore on the
outer mitochondrial membrane in microglial and other cells, and its
ligands provide neuroprotective and anticancer properties.23−29 Structurally diverse TSPO ligands are being explored for treatment
of chronic pain, inflammation, anxiety, mood disorders, neurodegeneration,
and diseases of cellular proliferation.30,31 Thus, both
of these membrane-bound protein families are important therapeutic
targets.

Results
Here, we extend the polypharmacology of rigid
nucleosides to enhance
affinity at KOR by functional group or heterocyclic replacement on
the same scaffold, in some cases with accompanying moderate affinity
at TSPO. Furthermore, we discovered modifications of the adenine moiety
and its substituents that allowed MOR and/or DOR interactions as antagonists.
The receptor interactions of representative nucleosides, based on
a KOR X-ray crystallographic structure, were modeled to provide a
self-consistent hypothesis for recognition. In this study, we did
not model the TSPO interaction or probe the effects of the methanocarba
ring isomer having the opposite South (S) conformation.32 Thus, we have repurposed a nucleoside scaffold
from ARs to bind at another rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor
(GPCR) family.5,33

Compound Design
The previously noted binding of (N)-methanocarba
nucleosides 1 and 2 at the rat kidney TSPO
was dependent on the presence of a 5′-ethyl or 5′-n-propyl ester.7 These esters
bound to TSPO with greater affinity than the corresponding 5′-methyl
ester or 5′-methylamide, which had Ki values >10 μM (data not shown). Removing the alkyloxycarbonyl
group of 1, that is, to give an N6-dicyclopropylmethyl 4′-truncated analogue (structure
not shown), also prevented TSPO binding.4 Thus, a medium-sized 5′-alkyl ester was conducive to TSPO
interaction. However, with enlarged substituents at both N6 and C2 positions, 5′-methylamide 4 bound with
greater affinity at the TSPO than 5′-esters 1 and 2 or its 4′ truncated equivalent 3. Thus,
we explored here the interplay between the 5′, N6 and C2 positions and adenine ring nitrogens in the SAR of rigid
nucleosides initially at TSPO and subsequently at the ORs.

The
current study began with a focus on N6-3-chlorobenzyl 5′-methylamide derivatives (Table 1, 4–9),
but that scope was subsequently expanded to include a range of other
N6-alkyl or N6-alkylaryl derivatives with 5′-carbonyl
groups (Tables 2 and 3, 10–43). To explore the SAR
around the detected OR and TSPO interactions of nucleosides, we chose
to modify the rigid adenosine derivatives at the 5′ position,
from amides to esters, and at the N6 and C2 positions.
The default C2 substitution was 5-chloro-thien-2-yl-ethynyl, upon
which halogen was substituted, or other arylethynyl groups were introduced.
We included various 4′-truncated (Tables 4 and 5, 47–58) and other derivatives that were synthesized previously in the context
of ARs or DAT.2,3,5,6,34,35 In addition, N6-propyl
(19 and 20) and 1-, 3-, or 7-deaza-adenine
(17, 26–29, 39–44 and 54–58) analogues were prepared for this
study.

Chemical
Synthesis
We previously reported the synthesis
of numerous 5′-methylamide and 5′-ester derivatives
(and truncated derivatives) of N6-alkyl
C2-arylalkynyl (N)-methanocarba nucleosides similar to 1–4.2,3,6,36,37 The synthesis of analogues with
C2–H (17, Scheme S1), N6-propyl-modified (19, 20, Scheme S2), and
1-deaza (26, Scheme S3) modifications is described in
the Supporting Information.

The synthesis
of target 7-deaza-2-arylalkynyl nucleosides began with a C2-iodo derivative 72 of the nucleobase (Scheme 1). Initially, compound 60 (Supporting Information, Scheme S4) was subjected
to a lithiation reaction with n-BuLi in the presence
of Bu3SnCl. However, instead of the desired product, it
gave an unanticipated butyl keto derivative 63, which
was further transformed to 2-iodo compound 64. C6 amination
of compound 64 with methylamine followed by a Sonogashira
coupling with 5-chloro-thienylacetylene and subsequent acid hydrolysis
provided the 5′-(butyl-keto) nucleoside 44. To
overcome this barrier to the synthesis of 7-deaza nucleosides, a convergent
approach was designed. 7-Deaza-6-chloro purine 67 was
silylated with TIPSCl in the presence of NaH to yield the protected
pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidine 68. Stannylation
of 68 with Bu3SnCl in the presence of n-BuLi provided the tin derivative 69, which
upon treatment with iodine and subsequent silyl deprotection afforded
7-deaza-2-iodo-purine 71. Mitsunobu condensation of 71 with glycosyl donor 59(38) gave the nucleoside precursor 72, which was
aminated at the 6 position with various amines to provide compounds 73–76 (Scheme 1). Sonogashira coupling of iodo derivatives (73–76) with various alkynes using PdCl2(Ph3P)2 as a catalyst followed by acid hydrolysis of the respective
derivatives (77–82) with 10% trifluoroacetic acid
(TFA) afforded the final hypermodified nucleosides (28–29, 40–43).
Acid hydrolysis of 2-iodo derivative 73 yielded the nucleoside
5′-ester 39.

4′-Truncated 7-deaza nucleosides (54–58) were synthesized in a similar fashion starting from the
truncated pseudosugar 83(39) (Scheme 2). Intermediate 83 was coupled with 7-deaza-2-iodo-purine 71 under
Mitsunobu conditions to give the nucleoside derivative 84, which was aminated with various amines to yield compounds 85–87. A Sonogashira coupling of compounds 85–87 with various alkynes gave C2-functionalized
derivatives 88–91. Acid hydrolysis
of compounds 88 and 89 with 10% TFA afforded
final nucleosides 54 and 55. However, attempted
acid hydrolysis of compounds 90 and 91 in
the presence of 10% TFA gave complex mixtures because of the high
acid sensitivity of the dicyclopropylmethylamino group;7 Dowex 50 was used as an alternative. Thus, isopropylidene
deprotection of compound 87 with Dowex 50 followed by
a Sonogashira coupling with phenylacetylene or 5-bromo-thien-2-ylacetylene
afforded nucleosides 56 and 57, respectively.

Pharmacological Testing
Assays
of ORs and TSPO
Screening of the nucleoside
derivatives at the human (h) ORs (Tables 1–5, Figures
S1–S3, Supporting Information),
including selected analogues at the nociceptin receptor (NOP), and
rat kidney TSPO (Figure S4) and at other
off-target sites, was performed by the Psychoactive Drug Screening
Program (PDSP). Initially, radioligand binding assays were performed
using membranes of mammalian cells overexpressing the receptor of
interest.40 The following opioid agonist
radioligands were used: [3H]Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-Phe-d-Leu ([3H]DADLE, 97) for DOR; [3H]N-methyl-2-phenyl-N-[(5R,7S,8S)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]acetamide
([3H]U69593, 98) for KOR; [3H]Ala2-MePhe4-Glyol5-Enkephalin
([3H]DAMGO, 99) for MOR; and [3H]nociceptin 100 for NOP. [3H]N-Butan-2-yl-1-(2-chlorophenyl)-N-methylisoquinoline-3-carboxamide
([3H]PK11195, 101) was used for TSPO. Other
reagents are found in the Supporting Information. Binding data for three neurotransmitter transporters, that is,
DAT, the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the serotonin transporter
(SERT), as well as the A3AR, using methods previously reported,3,33 were also included for comparison. A primary radioligand binding
screen was performed at each target protein using a fixed nucleoside
concentration of 10 μM, and those compounds showing >50%
inhibition
were assayed with full concentration-dependent curves. Binding data
determined by PDSP for these compounds at other diverse receptors
and channels are described below and detailed in Figure S5 (Supporting Information) and in some cases in
previous publications.2,5,8 To
further explore the potential off-target activities in the (N)-methanocarba
nucleoside series, we examined A3AR agonists 14 and 18 in broad screens of 240 GPCRs and 486 kinases,
and there were no additional outstanding interactions at 10 μM
at any of these sites (Supporting Information). Thus, the specificity for a few interactions was high, and these
nucleosides are not promiscuous binders.

3,4-Difluoro 5′-methylamide
derivative 4 has been studied as an A3AR agonist
for reducing chronic neuropathic pain, and some of its weak off-target
activities, including DOR, were already reported.4,36 Compound 4 bound to DOR with a Ki value
of 2.48 ± 0.79 μM (n = 4), while its 4-fluoro-7 and 3-chloro-phenylethynyl 9 analogues bound
more weakly. Substitution of the terminal 3,4-difluorophenyl group
of 4 with 2-Cl-Ph 8 prevented binding affinity
at DOR, but this and other compounds in this series (4 and 7) bound to TSPO with Ki values ∼300 nM.4 Thus, the DOR
affinity was sensitive to the C2-terminal aryl group, whereas the
TSPO affinity was less sensitive. A N6-(trans-phenyl-cyclopropyl) group in 10 (diastereomeric mixture) was not associated with measurable binding
affinity at TSPO or ORs. None of the subsequent 5′-methylamides 11–20 at 10 μM significantly inhibited DOR binding
(by >50%).

In the series of N6-methyl 5′-methylamides,
a C2-(5-chlorothien-2-yl-ethynyl) 14 but not a 5-bromothien-2-yl-ethynyl 15 group was tolerated in TSPO binding, but only one 5-chlorothien-2-yl-ethynyl
derivative in the 5′-methylamide series, 21, displayed
OR binding affinity. Thus, a 5′-amide extension as a 2-aminoethylamide
in 21 introduced μM affinity at KOR (Ki 2.9 μM) while reducing TSPO binding affinity (Figure S2). A 1-deaza substitution of 14 in compound 16 prevented TSPO binding, but its effect
on KOR could not be probed in the 5′-amide series, because
the reference compound 14 was inactive. N6-Alkyl extensions to substituted n-propyl
moieties in 18–20 maintained μM affinity
at TSPO with no significant KOR binding.

Unlike 5′-methylamide 14, the corresponding
5′-methyl ester 22 and its 5-bromothien-2-yl-ethynyl
analogue 23 displayed μM affinity at KOR but weaker
affinity than 14 at TSPO. Furthermore, an increased affinity
of homologated 5′-alkyl esters at KOR was revealed, and TSPO
affinity of <1 μM was determined (Figure S2). Specifically, the ethyl 24 and n-propyl 31 esters displayed Ki values at KOR of ∼400 nM. The 5-halo-thiophene substitution
in the ethyl ester series indicated an order of affinity of Cl ≥
Br (25) at KOR. The 5′-i-propyl
ester 31 and the corresponding carboxylic acid 38 were inactive at both KOR and TSPO. Further 5′-ester
elongation to n-Bu in compound 32 and i-pentyl in compound 33 decreased the KOR affinity
∼threefold compared with 24 but greatly reduced
TSPO affinity. Inclusion of cyclohexyl and phenyl groups on the 5′-ester
moiety in 34–37 led to variable moderate (μM)
KOR affinity or inactivity, with O-benzyl derivative 35 having the highest affinity (Ki 629
nM).

Compound 26 allowed the effects of the 1-deaza
modification
to be examined in the 5′-ester series, demonstrating small
affinity decreases at KOR and TSPO compared with 24.
A 3-deaza modification in 27 was permissive for TSPO
binding but prevented KOR binding. In contrast to the requirement
for the N3 in KOR binding, a 7-deaza modification in esters 28 and 29 both enhanced KOR affinity (∼40
nM) and allowed DOR and MOR affinity to appear (Figure S3). The preference for KOR in comparison to DOR and
MOR was 19- and 15-fold for 28 and 11- and 9-fold for 29, respectively. The preference for KOR in comparison to
TSPO was ∼20-fold for both 28 and 29.

In the 7-deaza-5′-ester series, modified N6 and
C2 substituents were explored. C2-phenylethynyl analogue 40 had 2–3-fold lower affinity at ORs than the corresponding
C2-(5-chlorothien-2-yl-ethynyl) analogue 28 and was inactive
at TSPO. N6-Cyclopropyl 41 and cyclopropylmethyl 42 groups reduced the OR affinity
compared with N6-methyl 40. N6-2-Phenylethyl-substituted analogue 43 was comparable to N6-methyl
analogue 40 in OR affinity, but with enhanced TSPO affinity
(Ki 480 nM). Compound 77,
a 2′,3′-isopropylidene-protected precursor of 28 had the same binding affinity at KOR, but was weaker in
TSPO binding. Compound 82, the isopropylidene-protected
precursor of 43, maintained affinity at both DOR and
KOR, but not MOR.

The inactivity of the ribose derivatives 45 and 46 compared with their corresponding (N)-methanocarba
derivatives 14 and 22, respectively, showed
that the rigid
(N)-methanocarba ring is required for interaction with both KOR and
TSPO. In the methanocarba series, 2-iodo 5′-ethyl ester 39 was included to test the requirement for an extended C2
substituent; in comparison to 28, there was only a ∼2-fold
affinity decrease at DOR and KOR and a large decrease at MOR and TSPO.

We extended the SAR analysis to a set of 4′-truncated nucleosides
in the same methanocarba series (Tables 4 and 5), to determine
if a 7-deaza modification was also OR affinity-enhancing without a
5′-ester and to analyze the effects of substitution at N6 and C2 positions (Tables 4 and 5, 3, 47–58). Starting with the lead of DOR and TSPO binding
reported for compound 4, the truncated N6-(3-chlorobenzyl) analogues 3 and 47 with extended C2 groups, and compound 48 that
had no C2 substitution, were weaker or inactive in OR binding, but 3 and 47 bound weakly to TSPO. Small N6-methyl 49 and ethyl 50 groups or an N6-2-phenylethyl 51 group did not produce appreciable OR or TSPO binding. C2-modified
analogue 52 and N6-(2,2-diphenylethyl)
derivative 53 bound measurably at TSPO but not ORs.

7-Deaza-modified truncated analogues were compared: the N6-methyl 54, N6-(2-phenylethyl) 55 and N6-(dicyclopropylmethyl) 56 analogues (all
C2-phenylethynyl) bound to various ORs in the micromolar range, while
5-bromothien-2-yl-ethynyl derivative 57 bound only to
KOR. However, lack of an extended C2 substituent in 58 prevented interaction with both KOR and TSPO. Therefore, as in the
5′-amide series, the 4′-truncated (N)-methanocarba nucleosides
bound with moderate affinity at ORs.

Binding assays at NOP41 indicated moderate-to-weak
affinity (Ki, μM) for 4 (4.56 ± 0.45), 9 (>10), 24 (>10), 25 (>10), 28 (3.71 ± 0.78), 29 (2.76 ± 0.67), 35 (>10), 40 (>10), 44 (>10), and 47 (>10). Single-point functional
assays at the three ORs, using a TANGO assay of β-arrestin mobilization,42 demonstrated that 5′-amide and 5′-ester
nucleosides 4, 24, 25, 28, 29, 35, and 45 were
antagonists at all three ORs, and no agonist effect was observed at
10 μM at DOR or MOR (Table 6). Agonist activity at KOR was not determined in the
TANGO assay. An additional functional output was determined by conducting
dose–response curves at KOR using an enzyme complementation
assay to measure β-arrestin2 recruitment to the receptor in
U2OS cells (Figure 1). Compounds 28, 39, and 40 inhibited the agonist response of 1 μM N-methyl-2-phenyl-N-[(5R,7S,8S)-7-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8-yl]acetamide
(U69593, 98). Compound 28 was the most potent
antagonist with an IC50 value equal to 794 ± 50 nM
(Table 7). Compounds 43 and 54 did not inhibit agonist 98 in the assay. The compounds were also tested as agonists, and only 43 stimulated β-arrestin2 recruitment and only at the
highest concentrations (30 ± 4.6% relative to full agonist 98). These compounds were further tested as agonists and antagonists
in the KOR-induced Gαi-dependent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated
cAMP accumulation (Figure 2). Compounds 28, 39, and 40 inhibited the agonist response of 100 nM 98, with compound 28 again being the most potent antagonist (IC50 = 2220 ± 830 nM, Table 7). Compounds 43 and 54 did not inhibit
agonist 98 in the assay, and 43 was a weak
agonist for KOR-mediated cAMP inhibition (28 ± 11% relative to 98).

Activity at the ARs, Transporters, and Other Off-Target Proteins
Some of these nucleoside derivatives, particularly 5′-methylamides,
were previously characterized as AR ligands. For example, compound 14 is also a fully efficacious hA3AR agonist of
high affinity (Ki = 0.70 nM).2 The hA3AR binding affinities in the
series of 5′-esters, such as 23, were consistently
in the μM range or weaker, and the affinity at mA3AR was generally much weaker than at hA3AR. The hA1AR and hA2AAR affinities of the nucleosides in
this study were generally >10 μM. As reported earlier,6 5′-ester 22 displayed eightfold
lower affinity than corresponding 5′-methylamide 14 in hA3AR binding; thus, the substitution of ester for
amide tended to increase both affinity and preference for KOR. The
7-deaza modification of 5′-ethyl ester 28 reduced
hA3AR binding affinity by 31-fold compared with 24, which is greater than the affinity loss in 1-deaza 26 and 3-deaza 27 analogues. Furthermore, 27 and 28 were inactive in mA3AR binding. 7-Deaza 28 was inactive as an agonist in a functional assay of hA3AR-mediated inhibition of cAMP formation (n = 3),43 with maximal efficacy at 10 μM
of 0.59 ± 6.62%, compared with full agonist 5′-N-ethyluronamidoadenosine (100%). Thus, the combination
of 7-deaza modification with a 5′-small alkyl ester in place
of the 5′-amide appears to turn A3AR agonists into
weakly binding A3AR antagonists or non-A3AR
binding compounds. The functional activity of 5′-esters 22 and 27 as hA3AR partial agonists
was reported.6 Therefore, the 5′-ester
modification alone reduces A3AR efficacy, while increasing
OR antagonist affinity. A 5′-n-propyl ester 30 had higher affinity at both mouse (m) and hA3ARs than the corresponding 5′-ethyl ester 24,
and among the extended esters, 5′-benzyl ester 35 displayed the highest affinity at hA3AR (Ki 7.81 nM) and at mA3AR (Ki 891 nM). 4′-Truncated (N)-methanocarba-adenosine
derivatives displayed varied affinities at hA3AR, as we
previously reported.35 The 7-deaza modification
reduced hA3AR affinity by 16-fold (in a comparison of 54 and 49) or 11-fold (in a comparison of 55 and 51), and the 7-deaza analogues were inactive
at the mA3AR.

Another recently discovered target
of certain C2-extended (N)-methanocarba-adenosine derivatives was
DAT, as 5′-methyl and ethyl esters in this series were potent
allosteric binding enhancers of tropane radioligand affinity (resulting
in enhanced level of binding in the primary screen) and inhibitors
of dopamine uptake (Figure 3).6 Enhancement of radioligand
binding at NET was also observed in this chemical series but less
potently than at DAT. Thus, it was important to establish effects
of the 7-deaza and other modifications on transporters, such as radioligand
binding enhancement in the DAT primary screen (Tables 1–3, shown as
a negative percent inhibition at 10 μM) and inhibition at NET
(Tables 4 and 5). Various 1-, 3- or 7-deaza derivatives (26–29) were compared to probe the participation of
these H-bond acceptor nitrogens of adenine for DAT recognition. The
1-deaza modification in the 5′-methylamide series prevented
enhancement of tropane radioligand binding at DAT, but not A3AR binding.5,37 Similarly, the conversion of
an N6-methyl to N6-propyl group in 18 greatly reduced DAT interaction,
and its 3,3,3-trifluoropropyl equivalent in 19 eliminated
it. The corresponding 3-deaza 5′-ethyl ester 27 was nearly as efficacious as 24 in enhancing binding
at DAT, whereas the 7-deaza 5′-ester 28 was much
less efficacious in enhancing DAT binding. EC50 values
for binding enhancement at hDAT determined by the PDSP for 28 and 29 were >10–6 M. Using an
alternate
tropane radioligand [125I]methyl (1R,2S,3S)-3-(4-iodophenyl)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo[3.2.1]octane-2-carboxylate
(RTI-55, 118) as described,628 enhanced hDAT binding by 320 ± 23% at 10 μM
with an EC50 value of 1410 ± 340 nM (Figure 3, Table S1, Supporting Information). Using a nontropane radioligand [3H](±)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-3,5-dihydro-2H-imidazo[2,1-a]isoindol-5-ol (mazindol, 119) as described,828 enhanced
hDAT binding by a maximal 267 ± 17% with an EC50 value
of 2160 ± 550 nM. The IC50 for inhibition of dopamine
uptake by 28 was >9800 nM. The potencies in enhancement
of binding at hNET and hSERT and in inhibition of uptake were >10
μM. Thus, in the 5′-ester series, the N1 nitrogen atom,
but not N3, was essential for interaction with neurotransmitter symporters,
and the 7-deaza modification greatly reduced these interactions. Byproducts
of the synthesis in the 7-deaza series were inactive at DAT, that
is, C2-truncated 5′-methylamide 17 and 5′-butylketone 44. In the 4′-truncated series, two compounds with
C2-phenylethynyl and small N6 groups, 49 and 50, displayed weak-to-moderate DAT interaction, but this binding
enhancement disappeared with extension of the N6 group
in 51.

and data for 14 and 24 were described in
Tosh et al.6 The 7-deaza modification in 28 greatly reduces the binding enhancement and inhibition
of dopamine uptake compared to 24. Compound 30 enhanced DAT binding with an EC50 value of 294 ±
82 nM (not shown). EC50 and IC50 values for
the curves shown and archival compounds for comparison are provided

The nucleoside derivatives were screened at other
off-target interactions
by the PDSP (Supporting Information, all
values Ki, μM). In addition to those
off-target interactions already reported for the archival compounds,2,4,6,37 affinity
at 5HT2A (27, 1.30 ± 0.29; 57, 4.34 ± 1.74), 5HT2B (6, 2.96 ±
0.60; 27, 1.78 ± 0.28; 77, 4.18; 55, 3.06 ± 0.17; 58, 1.33), and 5HT2C (21, 0.51; 23, 2.33±; 27, 0.40; 31, 0.43; 46, 3.24 ±
1.05; 77, 0.016) serotonin receptors was detected. Thus,
compound 27 bound to all three 5HT2Rs. Curiously,
2′,3′-isopropylidene protected compound 77 displayed a high affinity and selectivity (260-fold compared with
5HT2BR) at 5HT2CR. Compounds 6 and 43 bound to the human α2C adrenergic (6.3
and 0.51, respectively) and compound 6 to the β3 adrenergic (2.6) receptor. Compound 10 bound
to the human 5HT1A serotonin (6.3) and β3 (2.5) receptors. Weak affinity was noted at the muscarinic M1 (55, 6.97) and M5 (27, 3.85) receptors. Compounds 35 and 73 bound
to the human SERT (5.56 and 6.58, respectively). Intermediate affinity
was found in inhibition of NET binding (6, 3.16; 10, 2.31; 43, 2.82; 51, 2.80; 53, 5.78; 55, 5.65). Compound 57 bound to the rat brain benzodiazepine receptor with a Ki of 118 nM. Widespread affinity at the rat σ2 receptor was detected: 6, 1.54; 10, 2.51; 26, 1.76; 36, 5.87; 42, 1.11; 47, 2.73; 51, 1.48; 52, 1.82; 56, 0.67; 57, 6.92. There were
fewer and weaker interactions at the σ1 receptor: 9, 7.55; 12, 7.11; 22, 8.73; 27, 1.04; 47, 7.66.

Molecular Modeling at KOR
Docking and molecular dynamics
(MD) were exploited to rationalize the observed experimental data
by applying the knowledge gained from the analysis of X-ray structures
of KOR, MOR, and DOR with bound antagonists.43−45 Although a
TSPO X-ray structure was recently reported,52 we did not propose a binding mode at this protein and therefore
focused our attention on the molecular signatures determining OR affinity
and selectivity. In particular, we generated an initial hypothesis
for the KOR binding mode of the 7-deaza 5′-ethyl ester derivative 28 (Ki = 42 nM) and used it to
rationalize the SAR of a subset of structurally related analogues
(22, 24, 30–37). Compound 28 was initially docked by Induced Fit Docking (IFD) at a
hKOR homology model built upon an available X-ray structure with a
bound 4-phenylpiperidine antagonist43 (PDB
ID: 4DJH, see Supporting Information). In the resulting docking
pose (Figure 4), the
ligand resided in the upper portion of the TM (transmembrane) bundle
with the (N)-methanocarba ring pointing toward the EC side and the
N6-methyl group buried in the binding cleft. The C2 extension
was directed toward a Tyr-rich region at the interface of TM2, TM1,
and TM7. The ligand established interactions with residues located
mainly in TM3, TM6, and TM7, consisting of two H-bond interactions
of the C3′ and the C2′ hydroxyl groups with the side
chains of Tyr312 (7.35) and Tyr139 (3.33), respectively, and π–π
stacking interaction between the 5-chlorothienyl moiety and the side
chain of Tyr320 (7.43). Surprisingly, the ligand did not form a H-bond
with the conserved Asp138 (3.32) residue.

of residues important for ligand recognition (gray carbon atoms) are
reported as sticks. Residues in close contact with the ligand are
depicted as transparent surfaces color-coded according to the residue
type (red: negatively charged; blue: positively charged; cyan: polar,
green: hydrophobic). H-bonds and π–π stacking interactions
are pictured as dashed orange and cyan lines, respectively. Nonpolar
hydrogen atoms are omitted. The PDB ID of the X-ray structure used
as starting points for molecular modeling was 4DJH.

We subjected the initial docking pose of 28 to 30
ns of membrane MD simulation (run in triplicate). Replicas were run
by using different initial randomly assigned atom velocities, and
ligand–receptor interactions were analyzed qualitatively (ligand
and protein root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) values in Table S2). We considered a key His residue surrounding
the binding site, that is, His291 (6.52), in two possible alternative
protonation states and compared the two result sets (Video S1). A preliminary analysis of the His(6.52) environment
in the available antagonist-bound KOR,43 MOR (PDB ID: 4DKL),44 and DOR (PDB ID: 4N6H)45 X-ray structures unequivocally determined it as protonated
on the Nε atom (hereby denoted as HSE), as the residue
established a H-bond with the aromatic hydroxyl moiety of the co-crystallized
antagonists mediated by two highly conserved water molecules. As we
did not retain those water molecules during the IFD and the binding
mode of 28 (Figure 4) did not predict the presence of a H-bond donor moiety
in proximity to His291 (6.52), we also considered the alternative
protonation state featuring a hydrogen atom on the Nδ (hereby denoted as HSD).

Notably, in all the simulations run
with both HSE and HSD models,
the ligand moved deeper in the binding site with respect to the initial
docking pose to establish a persistent H-bond between the 3′-OH
group and the conserved Asp138 (3.32) side chain. However, as reported
in Table S2 and visualized in Video S1 (right panel), in the HSD model, the
ligand was characterized by a higher average RMSD value and was less
stable. By superimposing the lowest interaction energy (IE) complexes
extracted for each replica of the two models (Figure 5A,B), it was evident that TM1, which was
considerably displaced with respect to the TM bundle in the initial
X-ray structure,43 maintained its displaced
position in the HSD model and approached the TM bundle in the HSE
model. To investigate the reason for the different placement of TM1
in the two models, we analyzed in more detail a selected trajectory
for each model (Table S6 and Video S1) and focused our attention on the ligand-protein
complexes characterized by the lowest IE value extracted from each
trajectory. As depicted in Figure 5C, in the HSD model, His291 (6.52) rotated and pointed
toward TM3. This rotation was accompanied by the diffusion of water
molecules into the binding cavity that connected His291 (6.52) to
the conserved Asp138 (3.32) (Video S1,
right panel). The presence of this network of water molecules pushed
the ligand slightly higher in the binding site. In the HSE model,
His291 (6.52) maintained its initial conformation facing TM5, thus
allowing the ligand to be accommodated deeper in the binding site
(Video S1, left panel). Concerning the
placement of TM1 with respect to the TM bundle, in the HSE model,
the movement of TM1 occurred early during the equilibration phase
(data not shown) and was triggered by favorable hydrophobic interactions
established by 5-chlorothienyl moiety of the ligand with residues
at the interface between TM1 (Ile62) and TM2 (Tyr119), which persisted
during the production phase (Video S1,
left panel).

EL3, and TM7 were omitted to aid visualization. The PDB coordinates
of both complexes are available as separate Supporting Information files. The PDB ID of the X-ray structure used as
starting points for molecular modeling was 4DJH.

Considering both higher ligand stability in the MD simulations
and the analysis of the X-ray structures,43−45 we considered
the HSE model more reliable and inspected the ligand environment in
the selected trajectory more carefully. In the ligand–protein
complex characterized by the lowest IE values (Figure 6), the ligand was almost completely buried
and shielded from the aqueous environment, except for the 2′,3′-OH
groups and the 5′-carbonyl group (Figure 6B). Consequently, the interactions involving
those groups were mainly direct and water-mediated H-bonds established
with polar residues (Figure 6A,C). The C3′ group established an H-bond with the
conserved Asp138 (3.32) and a water-mediated H-bond with Tyr139 (3.33).
The C2′ hydroxyl was H-bonded to the conserved Asp138 (3.32)
through the interplay of another water molecule. Additional water
molecules connected the N3 nitrogen to the C2′ hydroxyl group
and the side chain of Tyr312 (7.37) and the 5′-carbonyl group
to the side chains of Tyr139 (3.33) and Lys227 (5.39). The 5′-ethyl
ester moiety was accommodated in a small hydrophobic pocket delimited
by Met142 (3.36), Tyr139 (3.33), and Val230 (5.42). The N6-methyl group was hosted in a hydrophobic pocket delimited by the
conserved Trp187 (6.48), and the fused cyclopropyl ring of the (N)-methanocarba
system established hydrophobic contacts with Ile194 (6.55). The 5-chlorothienyl
moiety lay in a hydrophobic pocket delimited by Tyr312 (7.35), Tyr119
(2.64), Tyr66 (1.39), Met112 (2.57), and Tyr320 (7.43) with a water-mediated
halogen bond interaction connecting the chlorine atom to the side
chain of Ser116 (2.61).

EL3, and TM7 were omitted to aid visualization. The PDB ID of the
X-ray structure used as starting points for molecular modeling was 4DJH.

We finally tested the ability of the binding hypothesis
suggested
by MD simulation (Figure 6) in rationalizing the SAR at KOR of a subset of structurally
related ligands, namely, 7-aza 22, 24, and 30–37. In the corresponding docking poses (Figure 7), all ligands maintained
the above described pattern of H-bond interactions while differing
in the 5′-ester group placement. The docking analysis suggested
that the hKOR affinity modulation arises from the ability of this
group to fit the narrow hydrophobic pocket delimited by Met142 (3.36),
Val230 (5.42), and Tyr139 (3.33). In particular, the hydrophobic contact
of the ester with Tyr139 (3.33) seems to favorably modulate the KOR
binding affinity, as the 7-aza methyl-ester derivative 22 (Ki = 3130 nM) binds in a pose that
superimposes well with the one predicted for 28 (Ki = 42 nM) and 24 (Ki = 396 nM) but lacks this interaction (Figure 7A). Slight elongation of the
alkyl ester chain is moderately tolerated, whereas further alkyl elongation/branching
or the introduction of aliphatic/aromatic cycles requires the position
of the bulkier groups to be either outside the above-mentioned hydrophobic
pocket (Figure 7B)
or completely solvent exposed (Figure 7C), respectively.

with the ligand are depicted as transparent surfaces color-coded according
to the residue type (red: negatively charged; blue: positively charged;
cyan: polar, green: hydrophobic). H-bonds, π–π
stacking interactions and halogen bonds are pictured as dashed orange,
cyan, and purple lines, respectively. Nonpolar hydrogen atoms are
omitted. Red solid lines highlight the changes with respect to the
binding mode predicted for the 7-deaza derivative 28 (Figure 3). TM6, EL3, and
TM7 were omitted to aid visualization. The PDB ID of the X-ray structure
used as starting points for molecular modeling was 4DJH.

Concerning the hKOR affinity increase and the display
of MOR and
DOR affinity in 7-deaza derivatives, we speculate that the presence
of a 7-nitrogen atom would trap unstable water molecules in the small
pocket delimited by the conserved Trp287 (6.48), thus disrupting the
hydrophobic contacts with the N6-methyl and the C7 atom.
Although we were not able to confirm this hypothesis, the MD simulation
of the HSD model clearly suggested the presence of ligand-destabilizing
water molecules in this binding cavity region. Moreover, the superimposition
between the proposed hKOR binding mode and the WaterMap computed by
Goldfeld et al. on the KOR X-ray structure9 (Figure S7) highlighted that the hydrophobic
moieties of 28, such as the 5′-ethyl ester, the
7-deaza position, the N6-methyl group and the C2-(5-chlorothien-2-yl-ethynyl)
moiety, overlapped well with regions predicted to be occupied by “unhappy”
water molecules. On the other hand, the N1 and N3 adenine nitrogen
atoms, the 5′-carbonyl group, and the C2′ and C3′
hydroxyl groups lie close to a region rich in “happy”
water molecules.

Finally, our modeling analysis also suggested
that the moderate
hKOR preference might arise from a water-mediated H-bond between the
N3 nitrogen and the non-conserved Tyr312 (7.35). Binding data suggested
that a 3-deaza modification might be incompatible with the ORs as
it clearly caused a loss of hKOR affinity (e.g., 24 vs
its 3-deaza analogue 27, Ki = 396 nM and % of control at 10 μM < 10%, respectively).
However, further derivatives need to be synthetized and tested to
fully support this speculation.

ADME-Tox Testing
The in vivo pharmacokinetics of 28 was studied in the
Sprague-Dawley rat (Figure 8 and Table S3), and in vitro preclinical testing was performed using described
methods (Supporting Information).5 Upon oral administration of 1, 5, and 10 mg/kg
doses, the bioavailability was determined to be 58, 92, and 60 % F,
respectively. Furthermore, in vitro preclinical testing (Tables S4–S7, Figures 8 and 9) demonstrated
that 28 was not an inhibitor of hERG (IC50 > 30 μM, using a fluorescence polarization assay) or CYP450
enzymes (IC50 ≥ 10 μM at 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6
and 3A4 isoforms) or cytotoxic to Hep-G2 cells (CC50 >
30 μM). It was stable in human plasma (98% remaining after 2
h) and in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids (100% remaining
after 240 min). The CACO-2 cell permeability (Papp, apical to basal) was 1.42 × 10–6 cm/s, with efflux indicated (ratio 15.6).

nucleosides from binding data.

Discussion
The affinities of the
present nucleoside derivatives are not comparable
to the most potent indolyl or tetrahydroquinolyl antagonists of KOR43 or sub nM antagonists of MOR or to known ligands
of TSPO,25,28,29 but nucleosides
represent a novel scaffold for the ORs and possibly TSPO. However,
to effectively repurpose this versatile scaffold, it was desired to
reduce the A3AR affinity, and in some cases A3AR agonist efficacy was also reduced, while enhancing KOR affinity.
Furthermore, activity at other sites, such as inhibition of binding
at NET or enhancement of binding at DAT was observed in some derivatives.
Thus, a major challenge in this study was to identify principles of
preference for KOR, which was largely accomplished in the 7-deaza
5′-ethyl ester series.

In general, affinity at both KOR
and TSPO was evident in this series
with extended C2 substituents, with weaker activity at DOR and MOR
(Figure 9). Nevertheless,
an affinity correlation plot (Figure S6) showed no direct correlation between KOR and TSPO, and we have
no reason to expect a binding site structural similarity. One of the
most potent ligands in KOR binding 28 (ligand efficiency
= 0.25) was consistently the most potent KOR antagonist tested in
two functional assays, that is, to block the activity of a reference
agonist (98, U69593, nor-BNI) in βarrestin2-dependent
and Gi-protein-dependent signaling. Among 5′-methylamides,
the TSPO ligands with highest binding affinity (Ki 200–300 nM) were the 3,4-diF-Ph 4, 4-F-Ph 7, and 2-Cl-Ph 8 analogues,7 but not 3-chloro 9. However, we
also functionalized the molecules in a manner to distinguish between
the two receptor classes. Compound 14 bound with moderate
affinity at TSPO and was inactive at ORs. Among the more potent KOR
antagonists, 7-deaza compounds 28 and 29 bound to both ORs and TSPO, but ester group extension greatly reduced
the TSPO affinity. Also, compounds 39 and 40 with a modified C2 substitution and the unusual 2′,3′-isopropylidene
intermediate 82 bound with a preference for KOR compared
with TSPO. Binding at the ORs was sensitive to the terminal ring of
the C2 substituent. The C2-phenylethynyl group provided a slightly
greater peference than C2-5-chlorothienylethynyl for KOR with respect
to TSPO.

Ribose analogues 45 and 46 were inactive
at ORs and TSPO, although they corresponded to (N)-methanocarba analogues
that bound to TSPO (14) or KOR (22). The
equivalent 9-unsubstituted adenine nucleobase moiety of 3 and 4 did not bind appreciably to TSPO or ORs (Ki > 10 μM).6 Thus, the pseudoribose moiety is needed for interaction at these
sites. The rigid (N)-methanocarba ring promoted interaction with these
receptors, possibly by maintaining a specific receptor-preferred conformation
of this pseudoribose moiety.

There is an overlap in the nucleoside
structures that act allosterically
at DAT (e.g., 14 and 24) and those that
inhibit KOR binding. As for the KOR binders, a 5′-ester group
favored DAT interaction. However, changing the size of the 5′-ester
group was a means of separating those activities. While both 5′-methyl
and ethyl esters acted at DAT, the 5′-methyl ester was inactive
at KOR. The larger (5′-propyl and beyond) esters were less
potent and efficacious than smaller esters in enhancing tropane radioligand
binding at DAT but retained some KOR affinity. The 5′-propyl
ester 30 enhanced human DAT binding with an EC50 value of 294 ± 82 nM, which is less potent than the 5′-ethyl
ester 24 (EC50 34 ± 13 nM).33 Thus, even in the 7-aza series, we have partially
separated the activity at KOR from interactions with other receptors
and transporters.

We have shown that a 3-deaza modification
removed OR affinity,
but TSPO interaction is still present. Compound 28 had
an 11-fold preference for binding at KOR versus TSPO. The 1-deaza
(26) and to some extent the 7-deaza (28 and 29) modifications are a means of eliminating DAT interaction
in this series. The most effective means of separating OR binding
affinity relative to other sites of action, that is, DAT and ARs,
is the 7-deaza modification. However, many 7-deaza nucleosides here
also bound to TSPO. A 5-bromothien-2-yl-ethynyl group prevented TSPO
binding in the 5′-amide but not 5′-ester or 4′-truncated
series. Curiously, various nucleosides with large N6 substituents
(e.g., N6-2-phenylethyl in 43, 51, and 55) weakly inhibited NET binding,
rather than enhancing it as seen in radioligand assays with reference
compounds 14 and 24.

Truncation of
the 5′-amide or ester group was compatible
with moderate binding at TSPO and weaker binding at ORs. The most
potent truncated ligands (Ki, nM) at TSPO
were 52 (877) and 57 (353). The most potent
truncated ligands (Ki, nM) were 54 (1120) and 55 (1130) at KOR and 56 (1440) at MOR (all C2-phenylethynyl 7-deaza analogues). We expect
the 4′-truncated analogues to bind to ORs in a similar orientation
as the full nucleosides, but without the 5′-group (fitting
a narrow hydrophobic pocket) the ligands are likely not well anchored
in the binding site.

There is a possibility that a compound
acting centrally as both
KOR antagonist and dopamine uptake inhibitor could have a beneficial,
synergistic antidepressant effect based on these two mechanisms. KOR
activation reduces the availability of dopamine in the brain, and
KOR agonists induce depression.16,46 However, we have not
evaluated the benefit of additivity of activities of these nucleosides
at receptors, channels, and transporters.

We have demonstrated
oral bioavailability of the KOR antagonist 28. The presence
of an ester group that is conducive to high
OR affinity in the present chemical series might be predictive of
a short in vivo half-life. However, the half-life (1.6–2.2
h) or mean residence time (2.3–2.8 h) of 28 (p.o.)
in rats did not indicate rapid hydrolysis.17 A similar result was obtained with a different series of (N)-methanocarba
nucleosides containing 5′-esters and 5′-amides;25 thus, the ester functionality in this (N)-methanocarba
nucleoside series appears to be sterically protected from hydrolysis
by the adjacent bicyclic ring system.

Furthermore, we have not
evaluated the ability of these relatively
complex nucleosides to cross the blood–brain barrier. However,
except for carrier-mediated transport of simple adenosine derivatives
by the equilibrative nucleoside tranporter1, nucleoside derivatives
that are derivatized at the N6 and C2 positions for potent
interaction with GPCRs tend not to readily cross the blood–brain
barrier, as indicated by a study of A1AR agonists.47 The potential use of OR antagonists acting peripherally
for cancer treatment has been proposed, based on experiments in MOR-knockout
mice and an unplanned post hoc analysis of patients receiving MOR
antagonist methylnaltrexone parenterally for OIC.48 Thus, there are applications for selective OR antagonists
in the periphery. Further study of these OR antagonists is needed
to determine if their action is predominantly in the periphery when
administered orally or i.p.

Conclusions
In conclusion, as with
our previous reports on repurposing the
(N)-methanocarba scaffold from ARs to 5HT2B and 5HT2C receptors and the DAT,6,7 we now show that moderate
affinity at KOR within the same chemical series is achievable. The
current findings expand our hypothesis that these rigid nucleosides
are indeed privileged structures.4 The
highest affinity as KOR antagonist achieved was ∼40 nM for
7-deaza ethyl esters 28 and 29, which displayed
at least an order of magnitude preference at KOR, including in comparison
to the A3AR and TSPO. Moreover, leads for ligands that
bind at DOR, MOR, and even NOP have been identified, and the KOR affinity
and selectivity of this repurposed scaffold could potentially be enhanced
in future studies. Unlike many of the known OR antagonists, these
conformationally locked nucleosides interact potently with KOR in
the absence of a free basic amino group, which is present in the native
ligands. The rigidity of this chemical series was exploited in the
molecular modeling of the KOR interaction of 28 using
MD simulations. Thus, we have repurposed a ligand class designed originally
for one GPCR to a different class of GPCRs and analyzed its KOR interactions
structurally in a coherent manner.

(N)-methancarba nucleosides have been reported.2,3,5,6,33,35,38 Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) was the source for most of the reagents
and solvents. Other reagents were purchased from Small Molecules,
Inc. (Hoboken, NJ), Anichem (North Brunswick, NJ), PharmaBlock, Inc.
(Sunnyvale, CA), Frontier Scientific (Logan, UT), and Tractus (Perrineville,
NJ). 1H NMR spectra were measured on a Bruker 400 spectrometer
with CDCl3, CD3OD, or dimethyl sulfoxide as
solvent. Chemical shifts are given as δ values in ppm from the
standard tetramethylsilane signal set at 0.00 when CDCl3 was used as solvent and the water peak at δ 3.30 when CD3OD was used as a solvent. A Bruker AV spectrometer equipped
with a z-gradient [1H, 13C, 15N]-cryoprobe was used. Analytical thin layer chromatography
analysis was performed using silica gel F254 (0.2 mm) coated on glass
plates (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). The purity of the terminal
nucleoside derivatives was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) (1100 series, Agilent Technologies Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using
as a column Agilent Zorbax SB, 50 × 4.6 mm, with a mobile phase
consisting of a linear gradient (80:20 to 0:100 in 13 min) of 5 mM
TBAP (tetrabutylammonium dihydrogenphosphate) to CH3CN
with a 0.5 mL/min flow. UV diode array detection was followed at 230,
254, and 280 nm. The final product nucleosides tested biologically
displayed >95% HPLC purity (254 nm). Routine mass spectrometry
(MS)
was performed using a JEOL SX102 spectrometer with 6 kV Xe atoms following
desorption from a glycerol matrix or LC/MS 1100 MSD (Agilent), equipped
with an Atlantis C18 column (Waters, Milford, MA). High-resolution
MS (HRMS) was performed using a Q-TOF-2 (Micromass-Waters), calibrated
(external polyalanine calibration) for proteomics was used. Observed
accurate masses (uncorrected for temporal drift) are as expected,
consistent with instrumental performance and standard compounds’
mass trends maintained over time.

in a broad screen of receptors and channels were generously provided
by the National Institute of Mental Health’s Psychoactive Drug
Screening Program, Contract # HHSN-271-2008-00025-C (NIMH PDSP). The
NIMH PDSP is directed by Bryan L. Roth MD, PhD at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Project Officer Jamie Driscol at
NIMH, Bethesda MD, USA. For experimental details please refer to the
PDSP web site at: https://pdspdb.unc.edu/pdspWeb/content/PDSP%20Protocols%20II%202013-03-28.pdf. The cell line used for preparing membranes for binding in human
KOR, DOR, and MOR is HEK-293s cells stably expressing the receptors,
grown in DMEM medium containing 200 (DOR and MOR) or 500 (KOR) μg/mL

(1.0–2.0) nM. The hDOR, hKOR, and hMOR reference ligands had Ki values of natrindole 108, 0.81
± 0.08 nM; salvinorin A 109, 1.93 ± 0.45 nM;
and morphine 110, 2.62 ± 0.22 nM, respectively.

The radioligand for binding in membranes of HEKT cells expressing
hNOP was [3H]nociceptin 100 (pKi 9.11 ± 0.12, 0.5–2.0 nM used), and the reference
ligand was 7-[[4-(2,6-dichlorophenyl)-1-piperidinyl]methyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydro-1-methyl-5H-benzocyclohepten-5-ol (SB612111), 111 (Ki = 6.58 ± 1.42 nM).

The buffer used
for TSPO binding was 50 mM Tris·acetate, pH
7.4, room temperature. The reference ligand 4′-chlorodiazepam
for TSPO binding had a Ki value of 27.6
± 2.3 nM.

Binding assays at DAT, NET, and SERT were performed
as described.5,8,40 The
protein content and Ki values were determined,
as reported.50,51 The radioligands used by PDSP
for NET and SERT binding were [3H](R,S)-3-(2-methoxyphenoxy)-N-methyl-3-phenylpropan-1-amine 104 and [3H](R,S)-1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1,3-dihydroisobenzofuran-5-carbonitrile 105, respectively.

βArrestin2 Recruitment
Assay
The DiscoveRx PathHunter
enzyme complementation assay (PathHunter U2OS OPRK1 β-Arrestin
Cell Line) cell line was used to assess βarrestin2 recruitment
to KOR according to the manufacturer’s instruction and as described
in detail previously.53 Nonlinear regression
analysis was used to generate IMAX, EC50 and IC50 values in GraphPad Prism, v. 7.0 (San
Diego, CA).

cAMP Accumulation Assay
Cyclic AMP
accumulation was
measured by treating CHO cells stably, expressing the hKOR with test
compounds in the presence of 20 μM forskolin and 25 μM
4-(3-butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl)imidazolidin-2-one for 30 min at room
temperature. Detection of cAMP accumulation was done using Cisbio’s
dynamic 2 kit (Cisbio Bioassays, Bedford, MA) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism, v. 7.0 (San
Diego, CA).
