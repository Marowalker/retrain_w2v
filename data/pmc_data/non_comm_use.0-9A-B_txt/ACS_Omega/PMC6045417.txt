The rapid and portable detection
of trace chemical warfare agents
(CWAs) remains a challenge for the international security and monitoring
community. This work reports the first use of natural photonic crystals
(PhCs) as vapor sensors for CWA simulants. Dimethyl methylphosphonate,
a nerve agent simulant, and dichloropentane, a mustard gas simulant,
were successfully detected at the parts per million level by processing
visible light reflected from the PhC inherent to the wing scales of
the Morpho didius butterfly. Additionally,
modeling of this natural system suggested several parameters for enhancing
the sensitivity of a synthetic PhC toward CWA simulants, including
materials selection, structure, and spacing of the PhC, and partial
functionalization of the PhC toward the analyte of interest. Collectively,
this study provides strategies for designing a sensitive, selective,
rapid, and affordable means for CWA detection.

Introduction
The homeland defense
and battlespace operation communities require
portable and reliable sensors for chemical warfare agent (CWA) detection.
The inherent toxicity of these organophosphates necessitates identification
at the parts per trillion level and, to date, only expensive and nonportable
instrumentation, such as mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy, have shown clear discrimination at the requisite sensitivity.1,2 However, a variety of other methods to detect CWA and CWA simulants
have shown promise, such as colorimetric,3−6 chemiluminescence,7−14 porous silicon,15,16 nanomaterial,17−23 piezoelectric,24−27 and electrochemical techniques.28−30 These methods, though,
are typically unsuitable for long-term field use owing to one or more
challenges, such as inadequate sensitivity and/or selectivity, sensor
poisoning, cost, robustness, or portability.31

Recent studies into both natural and synthetic photonic crystals
(PhCs) have shown that these systems are sensitive to vapors with
similar chemical and physical properties, offering a new means to
rapidly identify and quantify trace analytes.32−34 PhCs rely on
the principle of light interference when moving through periodic structures
of varied refractive index and dielectric constant, resulting in photonic
band gaps and structural color.35,36 Small changes in either
the refractive index or the distance between layers of the periodic
structure of the PhC can lead to significant changes in the wavelength
of reflected light—the basis of sensing via PhCs.32 Sensing in the visible light spectrum requires
periodicity of the layers in the nanometer range. Although three-dimensional
PhCs at the nanometer scale have been fabricated,33 natural PhCs currently show a significantly higher sensitivity
toward vapors because of their complex periodicity, as well as the
polarity gradient found within the natural PhC architecture.34,37 A recent work has shown that the light reflected from the scales
of the Morpho butterfly can be used
to distinguish between vapors of similar polarity and refractive index.37,38 The polarity gradient within the ridges and lamella of the scales
led to aggregation of the vapor in certain regions, altering the dielectric
properties of the PhC in a manner unique to each vapor analyzed and
detectable at the parts per million level.

Despite the promise
of PhCs as vapor sensors, few studies of CWA
simulants and PhCs are found in the literature and are largely confined
to photonic hydrogel sensors in the aqueous phase. Walker et al. pioneered
the use of photonic hydrogel sensors by using polymerized crystalline
colloidal arrays in conjunction with an enzyme chosen to swell or
shrink the PhC periodicity in the presence of a CWA simulant. Concentrations
of parathion and methyl parathion were detected at femtomolar and
micromolar concentrations, respectively.6,39 Although this
work has given rise to further studies of photonic hydrogels and CWA
simulants,31 this synthetic, aqueous technique
is not well-suited to rapid, reversible, and cost-effective vapor
detection of CWA simulants. Thus, although natural PhC sensors have
shown selectivity to common vapors, such as methanol (MeOH) and toluene,
their selectivity and sensitivity toward CWA simulant vapors have
not been established.

This work examines the viability of using
a natural PhC and visible
light reflectance to detect and discriminate between CWA simulant
vapors and other common vapors. Wing scales of the Morpho didius butterfly, a well-characterized natural
PhC,40 were exposed to water, methanol
(MeOH), and ethanol (EtOH), as well as the CWA simulants 1,5-dichloropentane
(DCP, mustard gas simulant) and dimethyl methylphosphonate (DMMP,
nerve agent simulant). Reflectance spectra in the presence of each
vapor were collected at several concentrations, and the entire data
set was processed using principal component analysis (PCA). Further,
the reflectance spectra for each vapor were modeled by generating
a periodic nanoarchitecture similar to that of the natural wing scale
upon exposure to each vapor. Collectively, the results of this work
are expected to provide the first baseline data set for natural PhCs
as CWA simulant vapor sensors and suggest avenues for designing synthetic
CWA simulant vapor sensors that outperform sensors based on natural
systems.

Results and Discussion
The nanostructure of the Morpho butterfly
has been well-characterized in other studies.32,34,37,38,43 In brief, Figure 1 shows that wing scales are comprised of parallel ridges
normal to the plane of the wing. A cross section of the wing shows
that each ridge in turn contains a tapered, tree-like structure with
seven lamellae extending on each side of the center of the ridge.
Lamellae are roughly 70–80 nm thick with widths ranging from
200 to 400 nm; the vertical spacing between lamella is on the order
of 150 nm, and the spacing between ridges is approximately 800 nm.
Hence, the wing scales are periodic on the nanometer scale, giving
rise to photonic gaps in the visible light region. Unlike most synthetic
PhCs, studies have shown that a polarity gradient exists within the
ridges of the wing scales, with higher polarities at the top of the
ridges. This polarity gradient is the key to sensing via reflected
light from the Morpho butterflies,
as the location of the analyte within the structure also contributes
to the wavelengths of the light reflected rather than refractive index
alone.34,37 However, the sensitivity and selectivity
of this natural system to CWA simulants had not been previously determined.

Figure 1 Morpho didius butterfly (a), M. didius cover and ground scales (b), ground scale
ridges (c), ridges showing lamella and microribs (d), and ridge cross
section showing lamella outcropping (e).

The sensitivity of the M. didius PhCs toward CWA simulants was studied by exposing the wing to a
variety of analyte vapors, with the reflectance (R) of each analyte measured individually at three different concentrations.
As shown in Figure 2, a manual system was used to vary the fraction of the analyte vapor
in the nitrogen carrier gas, and the reflectance spectra were collected
via fiber optics. The differential reflectance (ΔR) of DCP, DMMP, EtOH, MeOH, and water at each concentration relative
to pure nitrogen is shown in Figure 3a–e. Raw reflectance data for all experimental
runs can be found in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Traces for each analyte are unique and vary in intensity
with concentration, suggesting that the system is both selective and
responsive to the vapors tested, including the CWA simulants. However,
as evidenced by the smaller ΔR values relative
to EtOH, MeOH, and water, the sensitivity of this system toward the
CWA simulants is challenged by the relatively low saturated vapor
pressures of DCP (2750 ppm) and DMMP (1575 ppm).44,45 Thus, the limits of detection toward these CWA simulants in this
study are on the order of parts per million. Considering that the
nerve agent VX is lethal at concentrations of 0.3 ppm,31 this presents a challenge to use natural PhCs
for CWA detection. However, as outlined below and in the literature,
several avenues exist for increasing sensitivity via a synthetic mimic,
including careful selection of PhC refractive index, targeted functionalization
of certain regions within a PhC nanoarchitecture, and optimized PhC
periodicity, among others.34 It is important
to note that sensing nerve agents using an optimized, synthetic PhC
is expected to provide significant advantages over current technologies
in terms of sample acquisition and sensor portability, cost, and size.
These advantages should enable the deployment of robust, real-time
passive sensors and foster the integration of miniaturized sensors
for rapid and remote forensic analysis.

and 0.50P0 (⧫) for DCP (−),
DMMP (−), EtOH (−), MeOH (−), and water (−).
Note that the y-axis scale differs for the CWA simulants.
The PCA score plots (f,g) show discrimination of the vapors, where
the first three principal components (PCs) captured 91.9% of the total
spectral variance (PC 1 = 71.6%, PC 2 = 16.8%, and PC 3 = 3.5%).

To further examine the selectivity
of the M. didius toward the CWA simulants,
ΔR data for all
analytes and concentrations were processed collectively using PCA.
PCA is a commonly used multivariate analysis technique that reduces
the dimensionality of a data set by determining the principle components
that capture the variance within that data.46 Two- and three-dimensional PCA score plots of the ΔR data for all five vapors are shown in Figure 3 f,g, with data points indicating
an increase in concentration from left to right. Similar to other
studies of the light reflected from the Morpho butterfly upon exposure to EtOH, MeOH, and water, this work showed
good analyte discrimination (e.g., distinct PCA curves), despite similar
concentrations and refractive indices.38,43 Additionally,
the data also indicate good selectivity toward the CWA simulants DCP
and DMMP, despite their low vapor concentrations. Although PCA score
plots of previous studies of the Morpho sulkowskyi indicated a trend with solvent polarity,37 the trend was not clearly observed for this study of the M. didius. As mentioned previously, the Morpho butterfly scales contain a polarity gradient
moving up the lamella of the ridges, suggesting that analyte vapors
aggregate within certain regions of the scale based on their polarity
which significantly contributes to spectral differences. Studies indicated
that removing the polarity gradient within the wing resulted in trends
that matched the refractive index, similar to what is observed for
traditional synthetic PhCs without a polarity gradient.37 No clear trends in solvent polarity or refractive
index was observed in this study, which highlights the complex, multivariate
nature of vapor sensing via natural PhC systems.34 Regardless, the system studied here did show a good selectivity
to CWA simulants, although the sensitivity toward these simulants
must be improved for practical use as a vapor sensor for nerve agents.

Consequently, modeling was used to explore how a synthetic mimic
of the M. didius PhC might be designed
to improve the sensitivity toward CWA simulants (Figure 4). Although it is important
to recall that sensing via natural PhCs is complex and interdependent
on several variables,34 the simplified
model presented here is of value in illustrating how various parameters
might affect a synthetic PhC system. The model used in simulating
the PhC reflectance was based on the structure of M.
didius and is similar to that used by Jiang et al.,
with notable differences in the lamella and ridge spacing, as well
as the consideration of vapor coating the ridges in addition to the
lamella.43 Details of the model can be
found in the Supporting Information (Figure
S2). Reflectance data for all runs of the modeled PhC are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figures
S3–S7). Generally, the overall trace appearance and location
of peak intensities with the wavelength of the model system are comparable
to the experimental data, suggesting that the model PhC is a reasonable
approximation of the natural system. Additionally, the generated reflectance
spectra differ significantly from that obtained by Jiang et al.,43 illustrating the significant effect that model
parameters have on the generated spectra and the design precision
required for PhC optimization.

concentration simulated as a film thickness d, (b)
varied vapor refractive index, and (c) varied vapor location within
the lamella. The two-dimensional PCA score plot from Figure S7 of the model ΔR data (d)
highlighting the reflectance variance owing to vapor location within
the lamella. Insets show the modeled distribution of vapors within
the lamella.

Figure 4 demonstrates
how three parameters—vapor concentration, vapor refractive
index, and vapor location within the PhC—affected the light
reflected from the PhC model. As shown in Figure 4a, when the refractive index and the location
of the analyte within the PhC are held constant, but concentration
is increased, a slight red shift, as well as a peak intensity increase,
is evident near 500 and 600 nm. These phenomena resulted from the
increase in refractive index of the PhC model caused by the addition
of thicker layers of condensed analyte to the PhC surface.36 For Figure 4b, the concentration and the analyte location within
the PhC are held constant, whereas the refractive index is varied.
Of note, for analytes with very similar refractive indices (e.g.,
water and MeOH), the model yields nearly identical traces (MeOH trace
obscures the water trace), a result not observed experimentally, likely
because of the polarity gradient of the natural system and aggregation
of analytes in different regions.37Figure 4b also illustrates
the complex result when the refractive index is varied, as no clear
trend is shown in terms of peak intensity or peak shift. For example,
EtOH has the highest peak intensity but an intermediate refractive
index relative to the other vapors for the model studied. This highlights
the interdependent relationships between PhC structure and spacing,
PhC refractive index and dielectric constant, and analyte refractive
index, suggesting that these parameters can be tailored to increase
the sensitivity toward an analyte of particular interest.34

Similar to other studies, the model data
also suggest that the
location of a vapor within a PhC plays an important, even critical,
role in the selectivity of natural PhC systems, especially when considering
the combined effects of other parameters, such as concentration and
refractive index. Figure 4c shows the reflectance data when the location of the analyte
within the PhC is varied, whereas the concentration and the refractive
index are held constant. Relative to the model with uniform coverage,
a blue shift occurred, likely from a decrease in the overall refractive
index of the PhC system. Significantly, differences in the reflectance
spectra were observed at most wavelengths for the analyte concentrated
in the top, middle, or bottom lamella. A three-dimensional PCA score
plot of the modeled ΔR data for all five vapors
is provided in Figure S7. Generally, the
data are grouped on the basis of refractive index, concentration,
and analyte location within the PhC structure, with similar values
of these variables generating similarities in the traces. A two-dimensional
PCA score plot of the first two PCs is provided in Figure S8 and highlights the refractive index and concentration
effects.

Of particular interest in this work, the simulated
reflectance
data for all five analytes concentrated at each of the three locations
within the model PhC demonstrate the variation caused by vapor concentration
within certain regions of the model (Figure 4d). A greater variation between analytes
was seen in the middle and bottom layers, relative to the top layer,
indicating more pronounced spectral distinction between analytes in
those layers. This increase in spectral distinction is attributed
to changes in spacing between lamellae. For the model used here, a
greater vertical separation between lamellae exists in the middle
and bottom layers relative to the top layer (Figure S1), suggesting that the increase in vertical separation between
lamellae drove the spectral variance. This result is further confirmed
by careful examination of work by Potyrailo et al.34,37 Although not specifically mentioned by the authors, their modeling
data also show increased spectral distinction with increased vertical
separation between lamellae. However, in contrast to the work presented
here, their model had a greater lamellar separation in the top layer
and a corresponding increase in the spectral variance in the top layer
over the middle and bottom layers.37 Coupled
with their result that a tapered lamellar structure was not important
for vapor selectivity,34 these studies
highlight the relevance of lamellar spacing in spectral distinction.
Collectively, these results show that targeted functionalization of
regions with optimized periodic dimensions could lead to increased
sensitivity toward a trace analyte.

Results from the modeling
suggest several strategies to increase
the sensitivity of a synthetic PhC toward CWA simulants. For example,
the refractive index difference between the analyte vapor and the
PhC structure passed through a maximum in the model studied. Thus,
selecting a PhC material with a higher refractive index than chitin
should increase the sensitivity toward CWA simulants. Additionally,
the lethality of CWA agents is typically expressed in terms of exposure
concentration per unit time (e.g., 10 mg·min·m–3 for VX).47 Thus, the functionalization
of a PhC surface with a material that binds the CWA of interest (e.g.,
acetylchlonesterase for VX) could concentrate that analyte with increasing
exposure time, resulting in a detectable signal over time that still
falls below the lethal exposure dosage. Modeling also showed that
spectral differences could be enhanced by altering the periodic spacing
of the lamella. Thus, methods for generating polarity gradients or
functionalization of the synthetic PhC mimic should focus on concentrating
the analyte vapor in regions of optimized lamellar periodicity. When
combined with other known methods to enhance the PhC sensitivity via
operating in stimulated emission regimes, synthesizing higher numbers
of lamellae, optimizing ridge spacing, and considering the PhC extinction
coefficient, the detection of CWA simulants should be possible in
the parts per billion range or better.34,48

Conclusions
In summary, this work highlights the first report of sensing CWA
simulant vapors via light reflected from a natural PhC. The system
was selective toward different simulant vapors and was able to distinguish
between analytes of similar polarity and refractive index. Sensitivity
toward the analytes was in the parts per million range, although modeling
suggested that the sensitivity of a synthetic mimic toward CWA simulants
could be improved by the careful selection of PhC refractive index,
targeted functionalization of certain regions within a PhC nanoarchitecture,
and optimized PhC periodicity. These results are expected to serve
as a baseline for future studies of PhCs as CWA simulant sensors and
guide improvements in sensitivity toward these analytes.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Butterflies (M. didius) were purchased from Butterfly Utopia and used as received. DMMP
(97%, D169102) and DCP (99%, D69602) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
EtOH (ACS grade, 111000190) and MeOH (ACS grade, 339000000) were purchased
from Pharmco-AAPER. Ultrapure water (Milli-Q gradient A-10, Milli-Q,
18.2 ΩM·cm, <5 ppb organic impurities) and ultrahigh
purity nitrogen (Airgas, UHP300) were used for all experiments.

Reflectance Measurements
A halogen light source (Ocean
Optics, HL-2000) and a spectrophotometer (Ocean Optics, HR2000+) equipped
with a fiber optic probe (Ocean Optics, QR400-7-UV–vis) were
used for reflectance measurements. The reflectance probe was positioned
normal to the butterfly surface, generating an illuminated area about
2 mm in diameter. In vapor measurements, the differential reflectance
spectra (ΔR) were measured relative to nitrogen.
Vapor concentrations were varied using a manual bubbler system to
alter the fraction of vapor in the carrier gas so that the partial
pressure of the analyte vapor was between 0.15P0 and 0.50P0, where P0 is the saturated vapor pressure at 20 °C. The total
gas flow rate for all measurements was 400 mL·min–1. Each spectrum was collected after 5 min of exposure to the vapor
and processed using binomial smoothing. PCA was performed on the raw
spectra after mean-centering the data.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Butterfly wing samples
were mounted to stubs using conducting carbon tape and sputtered with
5 nm of gold to limit the charge buildup. Scanning electron microscopy
images were captured using an FEI Helios NanoLab 600 scanning electron
microscope operated at 5.0 kV, providing image magnifications up to
30 000.

Optical Modeling
A 2D model based
on the ridge and
lamella nanostructure of the M. didius wing scales was generated in RSoft DiffractMod (Synopsys), which
uses rigorous coupled wave analysis to simulate the diffraction of
light moving through an infinite periodic structure. The complex refractive
index of chitin with n = 1.56 and k = 0.06 was used for the structure.41 Various
concentrations of the analyte vapor were simulated by coating the
structure with a thin film of thickness d and analyte
refractive index n.42 The
incident light was normal to the structure, while the electric field
was in-plane.
