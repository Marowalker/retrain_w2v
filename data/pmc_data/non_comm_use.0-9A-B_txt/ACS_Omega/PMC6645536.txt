Encapsulation of
active agents, such as vitamins and antioxidants,
is one of the possibilities that allow their incorporation in beverages,
food, or in pharmaceutical products. Simultaneously, encapsulation
protects these active agents from oxidation, producing more stable
active compounds. Formation of nanodroplets by spontaneously formed
microemulsion (ME) offers, on one hand, a low-energy technology of
encapsulation and, on the other hand, because of a small size of the
droplets, it assures long-term stability even in harsher environments.
In this study, oil-in-water MEs allowed the low-energy encapsulation
of α-tocopherol (αToc) into an aqueous medium with the
aid of fully food-grade ingredients, using isoamyl acetate as the
dispersed oil phase, which was selected between three different types
of oils. Both cosurfactant-free and cosurfactant-holder ME systems
were formulated, in which Tween 20 and glycerol were employed as the
surfactant and the cosurfactant, respectively. The ME monophasic area
was determined through the construction of pseudoternary phase diagrams.
The encapsulated αToc within 10–20 nm nanocapsules showed
radical scavenging activity dependent on the encapsulated amount of
αToc, as it was demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance
spectroscopy. The radical scavenging activity slightly increased within
the time investigated, indicating a slow release of the active compound
from the nanodroplets, which is a promising result for their application,
especially in pharmaceuticals.

1 Introduction
There
is a growing interest within the pharmaceutical and food
industries to protect sensitive oil-soluble bioactive compounds such
as vitamins in order to increase the public sanitation grades.1−6 Encapsulation processes of the bioactive compounds allow their protection
and delivery in a controlled manner and within a controlled environment.

Microemulsions (MEs), being the most dispersed of all, are particularly
interesting as colloidal delivery systems because they can easily
be created from food-grade ingredients using relatively simple processing
protocols. ME is a single optically isotropic and thermodynamically
stable liquid solution made of oil, water, surfactant, and mostly
cosurfactant. It is one of the favorable delivery systems applied
to increase the solubility of phytochemicals, nutraceuticals, and
food additives.7−11 MEs are normally easy to prepare without addition of high energy,
providing them an excellent prospective of scaling-up and a financial
advantage for industrial applications.12 Additionally, ME offers encapsulation of the active agents within
nanosized (<100 nm) capsules, which has been reported to favor
the stability, duration, and interactions with different matrixes,
facilitating controlled release and protecting the bioactive components.13

It has been widely reported that no single
strategy of encapsulation
is suitable for each kind of lipophilic component, and each colloidal
system must be designed individually.14 Therefore, the main aim of this work is to develop a ME system for
encapsulation of relatively hydrophobic antioxidant compounds using
completely food-grade ingredients. Different types of biobased oils
as the solvent for bioactive compounds were studied in combination
with a food-grade surfactant such as Tween 20 and vegetal glycerol
as a cosurfactant. α-Tocopherol (αToc) was selected as
the model compound because it is one of the most studied antioxidants
from the group of oil-soluble vitamin tocopherols, known by the common
name of vitamin E.15 It has superior bioavailability
and the human body absorbs and metabolizes this form of vitamin E
better than the others.16,17 αToc, as the
most important oil-soluble antioxidant, protects membranes from oxidation
by reacting with lipid radicals produced in the lipid peroxidation
chain reaction.18−20 This removes the free radical intermediates and stops
the propagation reactions, yielding oxidized α-tocopheroxyl
radicals that may be further activated via reduction by other antioxidants,
such as ascorbate, retinol, or ubiquinol.21,22

However, αToc as a functional ingredient is highly susceptible
to oxidizing agents, turning dark and losing out the activity when
exposed to air, heat, and light.23−27 Moreover, because of its oily structure, it is water-insoluble;
thus, it is essential to protect it against degradation and to convert
it into easier-to-use forms. αToc has been widely encapsulated
and prepared in different forms, such as nanoemulsions,28−32 liposomes,33,34 and nanoparticles.25,35,36 Encapsulation of vitamin E has
been reported to improve its physicochemical stability during storage
time, in addition to its biological activity after consumption.31,37 Use of ME to encapsulate vitamin E has an additional advantage because
of the presence of a high amount of surface active compounds that
enhance transdermal drug permeability and transmembrane passage across
the alimentary tract; consequently, the bioavailability of vitamin
E in oil-in-water (O/W) ME systems has been reported to be enhanced.38−41

The ME approach has widely been used in nanoencapsulation
of bioactive
compounds in general42,43 and for nanoencapsulation of
αToc in particular.38,44−47 However, completely edible systems were reported only in two of
them, up to the authors’ best knowledge.38,44 In order to complement these few pioneering studies in which the
main focus was on the relationship between the structural design of
the ME and the properties of the colloidal dispersions, herein we
presented a simplified approach to encapsulate αToc in ME systems.
In this approach, in addition to using a cosurfactant in the formulation
of our αToc-loaded MEs, cosurfactant-free ME systems were developed,
too. The elimination of one component from already complex ME formulations
may be an onward step toward commercial application. Nanodroplet size
was obtained in both cases (10–20 nm), which indeed provides
an excellent long-term stability of the colloidal dispersions and
protects the encapsulated αToc against degradation. Moreover,
the radical scavenging capacity of the encapsulated αToc was
demonstrated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy,48−50 indicating a slow release of the encapsulated αToc. This investigation
is one step forward toward the development of enriching αToc
water-soluble products for application in food, beverage, and especially
pharmaceutical industries.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Pseudoternary Phase Diagrams
As the
main aim of the ME formulation for encapsulation of αToc is
its application in food, beverage, and pharmaceutical industries,
the choices of surfactant and cosurfactant have to meet the constraints
issued from the current regulations for food formulations as well
as the economic viability for the food industry. In the present work,
the nonionic surfactant Tween 20 was selected as an ingredient for
food-grade ME processing. Low toxicity potential, lack of irritation,
and its ability to form stable emulsions are the main advantages of
using this surfactant.14,51,52 Nevertheless, MEs were stabilized by an interfacial film of surfactant
molecules, mostly together with a cosurfactant in order to decrease
the interfacial tension substantially. Considering the potential cosurfactants,
neutral vegetable glycerol has been selected, as it had been used
in the past instead of water for further improvement of the bioactive
molecule protection and solubility.53,54 To select
an oil with the best performance for the creation of stable O/W MEs,
three different oils were studied: lemon oil, ispropyl myristate (IPM),
and isoamyl acetate (IAAc).

To understand the phase behavior
and the transition boundaries of the present multicomponent ME system,
the pseudoternary phase diagrams were created. Figure S1 shows the pseudoternary phase diagrams of the blank
MEs for all the tested oils in the absence of the active agent (αToc).
Each row of this figure belongs to an identical oil, whereas each
column represents a different ratio between Tween 20 and glycerol,
including 1:1; 2:1; and 1:0.

Almost in all the cases, relatively
small areas of stable MEs were
obtained. It is widely regarded that the weight ratio of the surfactant
to the cosurfactant is one of the key elements that affects the area
of the ME region.55,56 For all the studied oils, the
ME area increased slightly by decreasing the cosurfactant amount and
reached the maximum in the case of the cosurfactant-free system (the
last column of Figure S1). This behavior,
although it was unexpected, can be explained by the reported strong
repulsive interactions between Tween 20 and glycerol, which causes
the low coverage of the oil–water interface at the junction
of the surface domains of both active compounds.57 Thus, eliminating the cosurfactant in the present system
resulted in higher coverage of the oil–water interface area,
more effective emulsification, and growth of the ME area as shown
in Figure S1.

Figure S1 also shows that the type of
oil influences significantly the phase behavior in the presented systems.
The molar volume of the oil phase, determined by its molecular weight
and density, seems to have an important influence on the phase behavior
of the system, as it determines the extent of the penetration of the
oil within the surfactant hydrophobic tails. Therefore, the oil with
long molecular chains and extended chemical structures will penetrate
less within the surfactant.58 Among the
investigated oils, IAAc formed the greatest ME area (Figure S1c). Lower molecular weight (130.18 g mol–1) and higher density (876 kg m–3) of IAAc in comparison
to the other two oils obviously allowed it to interact better with
the surfactant. IAAc has been used as a food flavor for a long time
because of its banana aroma. Therefore, it is considered to be a kind
of “safe oil” and was selected as the oil phase in further
experiments of the present work for encapsulation of αToc.

The effect of addition of αToc dissolved in IAAc (50 wt %)
within the ME formulation on the phase behavior of the systems was
further examined in the case of IAAc as the oil phase for each previously
studied Tween 20/glycerol ratio. The corresponding pseudoternary phase
diagrams are presented in Figure 1. The presence of αToc decreased the areas of
stable MEs in comparison to αToc-free systems (Figure S1c), which likely happened because of the increased
interface tension between the phases and as a result of replacing
50 wt % of the oil with a more hydrophobic component (αToc)
within the ME formulations. Nevertheless, the effect of the Tween
20/glycerol ratio was not changed by the presence of αToc, and
a decreasing glycerol concentration resulted in systems that are more
colloidally stable.

Figure 1 Pseudoternary phase behaviors of the system (IAAc + αToc)/(Tween
20, glycerol)/water at 25 °C. The weight ratio of Tween 20 to
glycerol is 1:1 (a), 2:1 (b), and 1:0 (c). The oil to surfactant ratios
were set at 1:9 and 2:9 levels. The ME regions are labeled in green,
and the approximate droplet size obtained by DLS measurements are
written above these regions.

The formulations of the stable mixtures containing αToc
are
presented in Table S1, whereas in Figure S2 the photos of all mixtures are shown,
presenting the appearance of all samples after overnight mixing under
ambient conditions. It can be observed that mostly viscous mixtures
were formed for the water content within the range of 8.5–33
wt %. For water contents higher than 33 wt %, the mixtures were clear
because of the effect of the added water that swelled within hydrophilic
Tween 20 heads and increased the distance between the polyoxyethylene
groups of Tween 20.59

Figure 1a depicts
the phase diagram in which the Tween 20/glycerol ratio is 1:1. Out
of the 16 samples prepared at this ratio, only two samples as presented
in Table S1 were found to form a stable
O/W ME containing 4.3–5.5 wt % of the oily phase, 44.5–56.5
wt % of the aqueous phase, and 39–50 wt % of a mixture of Tween
20 and glycerol. The other samples prepared presented phase separation
or a gel structure (Figure S2) or they
even formed a clear and stable liquid, but their droplet size [measured
by dynamic light scattering (DLS)] was >100 nm.

When the
Tween 20/glycerol ratio was set at 2:1 (Figure 1b), a larger ME domain was
obtained. In this case, the corresponding weight concentration ranges
of the components were: oil phase 3.45–11.15 wt %, aqueous
phase 16.26–65.65 wt %, and surfactant 30.9–75 wt %
(Table S1). To load a higher amount of
αToc, the oil content in the ME must be as high as possible,
but the increase in the oil concentration may cause instability and
requires more surfactants, increasing the total cost as well as the
oral insecurity.60 In this work, the maximum oil amount of 11.15 wt % was emulsified
in a stable O/W ME by employing 31 wt % of Tween 20 and 15.5 wt %
of glycerol. On the basis of previous reports for minimizing the effect
of the surfactant,61 this amount of Tween
20 was considered safe and the respective ME composition was selected
for further study.

For the glycerol-free system (Figure 1c), the results clearly showed
that this
system had the largest ME region as already explained. Among the 16
samples formulated in this category, six samples showed a phase separation
or formed a gel (Figure S2), and the rest
of them were obtained as clear and stable liquids, presenting a droplet
size < 100 nm. Table S1 shows that for
this system, the amount of aqueous phase required to form a stable
ME varied from 19.5 to 83.3 wt % and that the maximum amount of oil
emulsified was 8.35 wt %. Further increase of the oil content up to
10 wt % was possible only for an elevated amount of surfactant, as
the water content in this formulation was only 9 wt %.

2.2 Physicochemical Properties of the Prepared
αToc-MEs
To study the effect of MEs’ composition
on their structural characteristics, the droplet size was monitored
by DLS for both blank and αToc-loaded MEs, and the results are
shown in Table S1. The average droplet
size of a ME may fall in the range of 5–100 nm.62 DLS measurements revealed that the mean droplet
sizes of an αToc-free (blank) ME were in the range of 7.53–10.17
nm and the droplet size distribution was monomodal [the polydispersity
index (PDI) values were very low as shown in Table S1]. The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images in Figure 2 present a more significant
droplet size increase after αToc addition (up to 50 nm) than
that obtained by DLS measurements (Table S1). However, by more careful observation, it is obvious that the larger
droplets consist of a few smaller droplets’ coalescent, which
likely occurred because of the sample preparation for TEM measurements
(droplet cast method). Therefore, it was considered that TEM images
confirmed the findings observed from DLS.

Figure 2 TEM images of sample
6 in αToc-free (a) and αToc-holder
(b) MEs.

Figure 2 shows TEM
images of a representative αToc-free ME (sample 6, Table S1) and the corresponding αToc-holder
ME. In both MEs, the oil droplets appeared well-dispersed without
any aggregation or clusters and in a nanosize scale with a relatively
narrow distribution. The αToc-free system (Figure 2a) contains a double amount
of oil (4.35 wt %), and thus presented a higher number of droplets
than the αToc-loaded system with an oil content of 2.18 wt %
(Figure 2b). Incorporation
of αToc into MEs affected the droplet size. Specifically, the
droplet size of an αToc-loaded ME was considerably larger than
that of an αToc-free ME, which was consistent with the data
shown in Table S1. In Figure 3a,b, the increase in average
droplet size after addition of αToc to blank ME as a function
of oil and surfactant concentration is shown. The hydrophobic nature
of αToc molecule caused augmentation of the interface tension
of the system, which consequently resulted in average droplet size
increment. The observed effect is the lowest (<2 nm) for the glycerol-free
system and increased with glycerol addition and by rising its content;
thus, the highest droplet size increment of almost 10 nm was obtained
at a Tween 20/glycerol ratio of 1:1.

Figure 3 Effect of the oil phase (a) and surfactant
(b) concentration on
the droplet size increment after addition of αToc to ME at 25
°C. See Table S1 for the formulation
details.

These results are in accordance
with the largest ME areas obtained
for the glycerol-free systems in phase diagrams (Figures 1 and S1) and confirmed the selection of the surfactant with an appropriate
hydrophilic-lipophilic balance (HLB) for the system. Increase of the oil phase content in the ME formulation
resulted in a higher increment of droplet size as the content of the
Tween 20 decreased simultaneously (Figure 3a), an effect that has already been reported
in literature.63 The augmentation of surfactant
content (Figure 3b)
first resulted in a high increment of the droplet size because of
a simultaneous increase of the dispersed phase and the decrease of
water content. However, the droplet size slowly dropped for higher
loads of the surfactant, and in the region of high surfactant loads
(and very low water content), preferably water became the dispersed
phase and this caused the droplet size to decrease.

These results
demonstrate that in the developed ME formulation,
the size of the nanodroplets could be varied rather in a narrow range
by variation of the loads of individual components. These effects
are minimized in glycerol-free systems.

The dependence of dynamic
viscosity on the water volume fraction
(W0) may indicate the structural transitions
in dispersed systems.54,64Figure 4 presents this dependency for all the investigated
systems. Each value in this figure is obtained by plotting shear stress
versus shear rate in the flow curves, displayed as an individual figure
for each surfactant to cosurfactant ratio. The flow curves (Figure S3) revealed that the majority of the
systems showed a nonlinear relationship between the shear stress (τ)
and the shear rate (γ), which is a characteristic of a non-Newtonian
flux material. Nevertheless, at high shear rates, all the samples
exhibit Newtonian behavior; thus, in order to simplify the further
discussions, the viscosity at high shear rates was taken into consideration.

at 25 °C, (c) glycerol-free system at 25 °C and (c′)
glycerol-free system at 37 °C. Green arrows depict stable MEs.

Figure 4 presents
that in general the viscosity behavior as a function of water volume
fraction (W0) appeared to be similar for
all the studied ME systems, except for some slight differences that
will be explained here. For glycerol-containing formulations (Figure 4a,b), in the region
of a low W0, addition of water increased
the viscosity to up to a maximum. At a low water content, where the
water is the dispersed phase, further addition of water resulted in
growing of the dispersed droplets and formation of clusters within
the oil phase, which are sufficiently close to each other to increase
the viscosity.54,64,65 After the maximum point (W0 = 30–35%),
the ME suffered a structural change to a bicontinuous mixture until
reaching a deflection point (W0 = 40–45%)
where O/W MEs were formed. Further dilution (W0 > 50%) resulted in a slow decrease of viscosity and a
constant
viscosity value of approximately 3 mPa·s for W0 > 70%, indicating stable MEs composed of individual
spherical oil droplets dispersed in the water phase.66 The oil to surfactant ratio did not influence the rheological
behavior of the ME for Tween 20/glycerol = 1:1. However, at Tween
20/glycerol = 2:1 as shown in Figure 4b, a higher oil to surfactant ratio induced an increase
in viscosities of the samples at a lower W0. The glycerol-free system (Figure 4c) behaved differently at a low W0, showing almost constant viscosity that could be due to a
higher colloidal stability of this system in comparison to the other
two, as already observed. Because of that, the deflection point in
glycerol-free ME occurred at a much higher W0. Similar to the other two systems, the oil to surfactant
ratio did not influence the rheological behavior of the samples at W0 > 70%.

In Figure 4c′,
the effect of W0 on the viscosity of the
glycerol-free system was studied at a higher temperature (37 °C)
to simulate the conditions under which the nanodroplets possibly will
be consumed. The behavior at 37 °C showed similar trends as at
25 °C; however, in general, the viscosity was much lower at W0 < 70%, which is probably due to the increase
of oil solubility in water and a further decrease of the interfacial
tension in the system, resulting in a drop of the interparticle interactions.
At W0 > 70%, the viscosity turned temperature-independent,
as the dilution became the dominating factor. This result suggested
that O/W structures are stable at body temperature and may be used
as stable vesicles toward the possible delivery points.

Differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis confirmed the
structural changes observed by the rheological measurements. In Figure 5, the thermal behavior
during cooling of one representative αToc-loaded ME series (ME
121, Table 1) is shown,
as a function of W0. For W0 ≈ 45 vol %, the exothermic crystallization peak
of the water was not detected upon cooling, meaning that the water
was encapsulated strongly by the surfactant/cosurfactant mixture,
binding strongly with the hydroxyl groups of glycerol and the ethoxylated
groups of Tween 20. This peak was observed for W0 > 45 vol %, and it shifted from −40 to −14.5
°C as W0 increased, indicating the
structural changes toward the bicontinuous emulsion and the presence
of free water molecules with the dilution. For W0 > 66%, the exothermic crystallization peak approached
the
one of pure water, indicating that the water in these MEs is the continuous
phase, and O/W MEs are formed. The heat of crystallization also increased,
indicating the enrichment of the continuous phase with water.

contents in αToc-loaded systems.

2.3 Stability of the αToc-Loaded MEs
The stability
of two selected αToc-loaded samples, with and
without cosurfactant, was assessed by DLS and UV spectroscopy measurements.
For most commercial purposes, it is critical that MEs are colloidally
stable and the nanodroplets are physically stable all over their shelf-life.
To evaluate the capsules’ stability, the evolution of the mean
particle size over a storage time of 3 months and the corresponding
UV spectra of αToc-loaded MEs over 1 month were followed. The
average particle size for both cosurfactant-free and cosurfactant-holder
systems remained nearly constant during the 3 months of storage period
at ambient temperature (Figure S4).

Encapsulated αToc is supposed to be protected against degradation
when exposed to ambient conditions. To prove it, UV spectroscopy measurements
were performed, as the degradation products absorb at different wavelengths
than αToc.23,46,67 The evolution of the UV spectra for samples 6 and 17 (Table S1) are presented in Figure 6a,b, respectively. The spectra showed the
presence of the most important peak characteristics of αToc
at 300 nm.68 The intensity of the peak
remained almost constant within the time, and no extra absorption
was noticed in the spectra, which confirmed the good chemical stability
of the encapsulated αToc.

during 1 month of cosurfactant
containing ME (a) and cosurfactant-free ME (b).

2.4 Encapsulated αToc Antioxidant Property
Assessment
In this study, EPR spectroscopy using a stable
nitroxide-free radical ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl) (Tempol)
was applied to study the antioxidant properties of the encapsulated
αToc. Tempol is characterized by a well-defined EPR spectrum
consisting of three peaks (αN = 16.6 G, g =
2.0078). The antioxidant activity of the corresponding blank ME samples
(αToc-free) toward the Tempol stable free radical was first
examined and only negligible decreasing of the radical signal was
noticed, indicating the absence of any scavenging reaction of IAAc
(the oil phase) toward the Tempol radical.

In the presence of
encapsulated αToc, the intensity of these peaks in the EPR spectrum
of Tempol was decreased because of the scavenging reaction taking
place between the stable radical and the antioxidant. In the αToc-loaded
MEs, the intensity of the EPR spectra was decreased as the concentration
of αToc increases. The corresponding EPR spectra in the absence
and presence of different concentrations of αToc are shown in Figure S5. Figure 7 shows the time-dependent Tempol inhibition percentage
of the nanodroplets with different concentrations of αToc. As
it can be seen in this figure, the amount of loaded αToc significantly
influences its inhibition activity. The inhibition did not decrease
in time, as it may be expected for not encapsulated αToc; even
more, the inhibition rather increased, which may be an indication
of a spontaneous slow release of αToc because of changes in
the medium during sample preparation.

concentrations of αToc

spectroscopy.

3 Conclusions
In this work, an αToc antioxidant compound was encapsulated
within nanodroplets created by ME media using completely food-grade
components for possible application as additives in food and beverages.
Three different oils (lemon oil, IPPM, and IAAc), Tween 20 as the
surfactant, and glycerol as the cosurfactant were investigated as
the ingredients. A cosurfactant-free system was studied in order to
determine the possibility of elimination of this component from the
ME formulations.

Among the studied oils in αToc-free MEs,
IAAc was selected
as the most appropriate one in terms of good compatibility with all
the other components. Using the selected IAAc oil, the MEs were loaded
with αToc, and the influence of the most important parameters
on the formation of MEs was studied (Tween 20 to glycerol ratio; oil
to surfactant ratio, and water content). The structural changes in
the pseudobinary mixtures were followed by determining the phase behavior
in the system, particle size measurements, rheology, and DSC measurements.
The concentration ranges of the ME components were determined where
preferentially W/O, binary, or O/W MEs were created and also the ranges
of the investigated parameters where the desired O/W MEs were formed.
The average size of the droplets was in the range of 8.38–19.21
nm. Further studies were carried out on selected colloidally stable
O/W αToc-loaded MEs, one of which contained glycerol and the
second one glycerol-free, and their stability and radical scavenging
activities were determined.

The stability studies performed
by following the average droplet
size and measuring the UV spectra within the time of storage have
shown that the nanodroplets did not significantly change the size
and that there was no new absorption peak created in the UV spectra,
whereas the characteristic peak of αToc was kept without significant
changes, demonstrating chemical and colloidal stability.

Using
EPR spectra measurements in the presence of stable Tempol
radicals, it was demonstrated that the nanodroplets have radical scavenging
activities, which was retained and even increased during the measurement
time, which demonstrates the slow releasing of αToc from the
nanodroplets.

This work is a proof of concept of the use of
MEs to prepare fully
food-grade nanodroplets containing bioactive ingredients, without
any utilization of high-energy equipment that characterized it by
reduced process costs and easier scaling-up. The results from this
study might provide an innovative applied technique in the area of
pharmaceutical and functional foods.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
αToc (≥96%),
lemon oil (California origin), IPM (≥98%), IAAc (≥95%),
Tween 20 BioXtra and the free radical Tempol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The vegetable glycerol was purchased from Essential Depot.

4.2 Selection of Oil
The procedure to
select the suitable oil for the developing of ME was based on a pseudoternary
phase diagram preparation that revealed the phase behavior of the
system. The three different studied food-grade oils were as follows:
lemon oil, IPM, or IAAc.

The O/W MEs consisted of water, oil,
and surfactant Tween 20 (HLB = 16.7), and glycerol was used as a cosurfactant
and it was compared with the cosurfactant-free ME systems with the
aim of replacing a certain proportion of the surfactant. The phase
behavior of the blank MEs without αToc was determined by pseudoternary
phase diagrams. Initially, the mixtures of the oil phase and the surfactant
phase (either with or without cosurfactant) of six different fixed
weight ratios (3:2, 9:5, 9:4, 1:3, 2:9, and 1:9) were accurately weighed
and put into six glass beakers. The different ratios between the surfactant
and the cosurfactant were 1:1, 2:1, and 1:0, respectively. The samples
in each beaker were mixed homogeneously using a magnetic stirrer for
30 min until oily liquid mixtures were obtained at room temperature.
Then, using the water titration method, aliquots of ultrapure water
were slowly added drop-by-drop into each oily mixture at room temperature.
After addition of each aliquot, mixtures were kept under stirring
for a sufficiently long time (from a few hours to 24 h) to attain
equilibrium. Phase separations were detected visually by the appearance
of cloudiness or sharply defined separated phases. The mixture was
determined as stable ME when it had a clear and stable appearance
and moreover when it showed a unimodal, average droplet size of <100
nm in DLS measurements. OriginPro 9.0 was used to draw the pseudoternary
phase diagram. Obviously, a fixed (weight, volume, or mole) ratio
must be chosen for any two of the components and one of the triangle
vertices represents 100% of this binary mixture. All the selected
MEs were stored at room temperature and the stability of each sample
was assessed by inspection in terms of visual clarity and droplet
size over time. The oil that produced the largest regions of stable
ME in pseudoternary phase diagrams was selected for further investigation
for αToc encapsulation.

4.3 Formulation
and Preparation of αToc-ME
On the basis of different
ratios between the surfactant and the
cosurfactant (1:1, 2:1 and 1:0) plus different ratios between the
oil phase and the surfactant phase (1:9 and 2:9), six formulations
of αToc-ME (Table 1) containing a fixed proportion of αToc dissolved in the oil
phase (50 wt %) were prepared. From each formulation, eight duplicates
were made and eight different quantities of water as written in Table 1, (last row) were
added to them. The obtained 48 mixtures were stirred for 48 h at 25
°C under light shielding. Similar to the previous section, the
ME regions were determined by plotting pseudoternary phase diagrams.

4.4 Droplet Size Measurements
Droplet
size distributions of MEs were measured using a DLS instrument (Zetasizer
Nano S, Malvern Instruments, Malvern, UK). This instrument determines
the droplet size from intensity–time fluctuations of a laser
beam (633 nm) scattered from a sample at an angle of 173°. The
final value of average droplet size (droplet diameter) is a z-average of three measurements that were analyzed in 13
runs of 30 s each. To avoid multiple scattering effects, the samples
were diluted before the droplet size measurements using ultrapure
water. All measurements were conducted at 25 °C after overnight
storage of the clear samples.

4.5 Stability
Studies
The stability of
two selected αToc-loaded samples, both kept under N2 and light-shielded, was assessed by two techniques. First by DLS,
the mean droplet size diameter and PDI of the samples were measured
after 1 night of storage and repeated every month for a total period
of 3 months. Second, the stability of encapsulated αToc was
studied using a UV-2550PC UV spectrophotometer (Shimadzu) by weekly
intervals for a month. Therefore, the absorption spectra of the respective
ME were measured in the 200–800 nm wavelength range. For both
the methods, the samples were prepared by dilution of the MEs in distilled
water. Distilled water was used as a reference in the UV spectroscopy
analysis.

4.6 EPR Measurements
EPR measurements
were performed at constant 25 °C, using a Bruker ELEXSYS 500
spectrometer operating at the X-band. The spectrometer was equipped
with a superhigh-Q resonator ER-4123-SHQ and the samples were placed
into an EPR flat cell. Typical instrument settings were: center field,
3485 G; scan range, 200 G; gain, 6.3 × 102; time constant,
81.92 ms; modulation amplitude, 0.2 microwave power, 2 mW. The data
were collected and processed using the Bruker Xepr suite. The experimental
protocol was as follows: in order to standardize the EPR method, samples
with three different concentrations of αToc (4.16, 3.33, and
2.17 wt %) were prepared as explained before. Then, the appropriate
amount of Tempol was added, to reach the final concentration of 0.1
M. The mixture was stirred and instantly transferred into an EPR flat
cell for analysis. The EPR spectra were recorded for 45 min at 25
°C. The inhibition percentage of the corresponding EPR spectrum
was obtained from the following equation and plotted as a function
of time49 1  where ARef is
the integral intensity of the EPR spectrum of the reference sample
(Tempol solution with αToc-free ME) and Asample is the integral intensity of the EPR spectrum in the
presence of the loaded system.

4.7 Morphological
Evaluation
FEI Tecnai
G2 20 TWIN TEM was used to study the morphology of αToc-ME.
Two selected samples were prepared by placing a drop of diluted ME
samples onto a film-coated copper grid; then, they were stained with
a drop of 2% aqueous solution of phosphotungstic acid, and finally
they were left at room temperature to be dried before testing.

4.8 Viscosity Measurements
The influence
of the oil content, the ratio between the surfactant and the cosurfactant,
and temperature on the viscosity of αToc-ME was determined using
a Physica MCR101 rotational rheometer from Anton Paar GmbH (Graz,
Austria), with a concentric cylinder measuring system (10.836 mm diameter
cup and 9.998 mm diameter bob). The rheological behavior of each disperse
system was examined by plotting the shear stress (σ) versus
the shear rate (γ̇) values. Those systems that showed
proportionality in both parameters (r2 values > 0.99) were considered to be Newtonian fluids and their
viscosity (η) was determined from the slope of the aforementioned
curve. All other systems were assumed to be non-Newtonian fluids and
their viscosity values were obtained by the viscometer at the highest
shear rate (1000 S–1). Measurements were obtained
at 25 °C and in order to see the effect of temperature on one
hand and on the other to simulate the body temperature, one series
of MEs has been tested at 37 °C as well. Reproducibility (triplicate)
was checked for the samples and no significant differences (±standard
deviation) were observed.

4.9 DSC Measurements
The thermal behavior
of the water phase of the MEs was determined using DSC 3+ Mettler
Toledo (Greifensee, Switzerland), weighing 4–8 mg of ME samples
on a Mettler M3 microbalance, in standard 40 μL aluminum pans,
immediately sealed by a press. The samples were cooled in liquid nitrogen
from +40 to −50 °C at 10 °C min–1. Each sample remained at this temperature for 2 min and was then
heated at a rate of 10 °C min–1 to +40 °C.
An empty pan was used as a reference.
