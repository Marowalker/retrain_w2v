Niemann–Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1) is a sterol transporter
expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes and hepatocytes. NPC1L1
resembles the lysosomal NPC1 protein including an N-terminal domain
(NTD), which binds a variety of sterols. The molecular mechanisms
underlying this multiligand specificity of the NTD of NPC1L1 (NPC1L1–NTD)
are not known. On the basis of the crystal structure of NPC1L1–NTD,
we have investigated the structural details of protein–sterol
interactions using molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area
calculations here. We found a good agreement between experimental
and calculated binding affinities with similar ranking of various
sterol ligands. We defined hydrogen bonding of sterol ligands via
the 3′-β-hydroxy group inside the binding pose as instrumental
in stabilizing the interaction. A leucine residue (LEU213) at the
mouth of the binding pocket transiently opens to allow for the access
of sterol into the binding pose. Our calculations also predict that
NPC1L1–NTD binds polyene sterols, such as dehydroergosterol
or cholestatrienol with high affinity, which validates their use in
future experiments as close intrinsically fluorescent cholesterol
analogs. A free energy decomposition and computational mutation analysis
revealed that the binding of various sterols to NPC1L1–NTD
depends critically on specific amino acid residues within the binding
pocket. Some of these residues were previously detected as being relevant
for intestinal cholesterol absorption. We show that clinically known
mutations in the NPC1L1–NTD associated with lowered risk of
coronary heart disease result in strongly reduced binding energies,
providing a molecular explanation for the clinical phenotype.

Introduction
Intestinal cholesterol absorption and reuptake of cholesterol from
the bile in hepatocytes depends critically on a particular sterol
transporter named Niemann–Pick C1 like 1 (NPC1L1).1 NPC1L1 was discovered as the target of the cholesterol
absorption inhibitor ezetimibe in 2005, even though other targets
have been determined in the brush border membrane in later studies.2,3 NPC1L1 has 42% sequence identity and 51% similarity to the ubiquitous
endo-lysosomal transporter NPC1, with which it also shares the overall
membrane topology.4 In hepatocytes and
polarized hepatoma cells, NPC1L1 locates almost exclusively to the
apical canalicular membrane, where the protein is thought to mediate
reabsorption of cholesterol from the lumen of biliary canaliculi.5−7 Intracellularly, NPC1L1 localizes to the endocytic recycling compartment
(ERC) in nonpolarized hepatoma cells and to the subapical compartment—an
organelle with similar composition and function as the ERC—in
polarized hepatoma cells.5,6 Both compartments are
particularly rich in free cholesterol, which is in continuous exchange
with the plasma membrane.8,9

It has been shown that NPC1L1 contains at least one binding site
for cholesterol and related sterols; this binding site is located
in its N-terminal domain (NTD). In addition to the NTD, NPC1L1 contains,
like many proteins involved in cholesterol homeostasis including NPC1,
a sterol-sensing domain in its transmembrane region.4,10,11 The NTD of NPC1L1 has been purified
and crystallized showing close structural and functional similarity
to the NTD of NPC1.12−14 Both of the proteins’ NTD bind not only the
cholesterol but also biosynthetic cholesterol precursors and oxysterols;
in addition, the NTD of NPC1L1 has also been implicated in binding
and transport of vitamins.15,16 The molecular basis
for the broad ligand binding specificity of the NTD of NPC1L1 is not
known. As mutation of NPC1L1 results in lowered plasma LDL levels
and risk for developing coronary heart disease;17,18 a molecular understanding of NPC1L1’s function in cholesterol
transport is crucial.

Here, we have carried out a detailed and thorough computational
analysis of the multiligand binding specificity of the NTD of NPC1L1.
Using the available crystal structures of the NTDs of NPC1L1 and NPC1,
we have built structural models of sterol–protein complexes
and determined binding affinities using molecular mechanics-Poisson–Boltzmann-surface
area (MM-PBSA)-based free energy calculations in direct comparison
with the experimental binding data. We show that the promiscuity in
sterol binding by NPC1L1 relies at least partly on the same key residues
in the proteins NTD. We also predict that intrinsically fluorescent
sterols, such as dehydroergosterol (DHE) or the related cholestatrienol
(CTL), have comparable affinity to NPC1L1’s NTD as cholesterol.
This makes them promising probes in future experiments and validates
their use in cellular experiments of NPC1L1-mediated sterol transport.5 A free energy decomposition analysis combined
with computational mutagenesis sheds light on the role played by different
residues in stabilizing the binding of cholesterol to the NTD of NPC1L1,
thereby directly linking the molecular interactions to clinically
observed phenotypes of impaired intestinal cholesterol absorption.

Materials and Methods
Computational Modeling
Homology Modeling and Structure Refinement
The NTD
of NPC1L1 was crystallized in closed conformation without any sterol
bound to it (PDB id: 3QNT, resolution 2.83 Å).12 For binding
affinity calculations, an open conformation NTD was built using the
Swiss-model.19 Briefly, the sequence (22–284)
of the extracellular NTD of NPC1L1 has been retrieved from the UniProt
(ID: Q9UHC9) database20 and used as a query for template-based
sequence alignment. The atomic coordinates of the NTD of NPC1 (PDB
id: 3GKJ, resolution
1.60 Å) was used as a template because it shares 32% sequence
identity with the NTD of NPC1L1, possess 86% sequence coverage, and
was crystallized in a complex with bound 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HCL).
Models were built based on the target-template alignment using ProMod3
as a part of the Swiss-model (sequence conservation between NPC1L1–NTD
and NPC1–NTD is provided in Supporting Information, Figure S1). The conserved structural coordinates
between the query and the template were copied from the template to
the final model, which includes 25HCL in the binding pocket. The final
NPC1L1–NTD structural model was subsequently imported into
the Maestro module, available in the Schrödinger package,21 and the structure was optimized using the protein
preparation wizard.22 This optimization
includes adding hydrogen atoms, assigning correct bond orders, and
building disulfide bonds. The protonation states of all of the ionizable
residues (at pH = 5.0) were predicted by PROPKA23 provided in the protein preparation wizard. The structure
model was finally optimized by energy minimization (i.e., only position
of the hydrogen atoms) using the OPLS2005 force field.24

Generation of Ligand Binding Conformation
Three-dimensional
(3D) structures of a set of six sterols (cholesterol, lanosterol,
25HCL, β-sitosterol, stigmosterol, and epicholesterol) were
prepared, as described before.25 NPC1L1–NTD–sterol
binding poses were generated using the molecular docking procedure
Glide.26 The ligand-binding site for docking
was defined using the receptor grid generation module available in
Glide. The centroid of the grid box (of size of 20 Å) was centered
at the ligand, and water molecules at the active site beyond 3 Å
from the bound ligand were deleted. Specific settings in docking and
scoring function parameters used in this study are described in detail
elsewhere.25,27 A proper starting binding pose
is crucial for molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding affinity
prediction.25 Therefore, each ligand was
docked, and the best 10 ligand poses were saved for further binding
pose analysis (docking scores are summarized in the Supporting Information, Table S1). As the NPC1L1–NTD
open-form coordinates were modeled based on the open-form structure
of the NTD of NPC1 bound to the ligand 25HCL,14 we adopted similar sterol binding modes also for NPC1L1’s
NTD. For instance, the 3′-hydroxy group (designated here as
the sterol head group) attached to the steroid A-ring deeply inserts
into the NPC1L1–NTD binding pocket, exactly at the same site
because it was found for 25HCL in the X-ray structure of the NPC1–NTD–25HCL
complex. The binding poses for all sterols are quite similar to that
for 25HCL with one exception; the plant sterol stigmasterol oriented
preferentially its D-ring attached “tail” toward the
NPC1L1–NTD binding pocket. Therefore, for stigmasterol, constrained
docking runs were carried out in which the head group was constrained
to be oriented toward the deep NPC1L1–NTD pocket, as observed
for other sterols. To verify the correct binding mode of stigmasterol,
we used both binding poses from constrained docking and unconstrained
docking for the binding affinity calculations. Binding poses for all
protein–sterol complexes as used for MD simulation are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S2).

MD Simulation and Binding Affinity Calculations
All
NPC1L1–NTD–sterol complexes were subjected to MD simulations,
followed by binding affinity calculations, which were performed and
analyzed using the Amber 14 software.28 Prior to MD simulation of complexes, each ligand binding pose (only
ligand) was subjected to geometry optimization at the level of HF/6-31G**
using the Gaussian 0929 and other computational
methodology steps, such as charge calculation and MD simulations used
in our previous study.25 Briefly, atomic
charges for all sterols were calculated from the electrostatic potential
at the B3LYP/cc-pVTZ level of theory, and for both, the calculation
of the electrostatic potential and the geometries, an implicit water
environment was modeled with the IEF-PCM continuum solvation model.30,31 These atomic charges were fitted using the RESP procedure being
implemented in the Antechamber module of the Amber 14 software.28 Subsequently, the tleap tool
in the Amber suite was used to build coordinate and parameter files
using the Amber ff14SB force field. TIP3P water molecules were added
to solvate the structures with a 10 Å buffering distance between
the edges of the truncated octahedron box.32 Energy minimization was carried out; first, using a steepest descent
minimization with all heavy atoms restrained for up to 1000 cycles,
followed by minimization of the entire system using no positional
restraints for 200 cycles. MD simulations were initiated with velocities
generated from a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution at 100 K, and
periodic boundary conditions were applied in all directions defined
by the octahedron box.32 The system temperature
was gradually increased to 300 K at a constant volume over a 200 ps
MD simulation period. Thereafter, the systems were equilibrated for
another 500 ps in the NPT ensemble with a temperature
of 300 K and a pressure of 1 bar using the Berendsen coupling algorithm.33 After equilibration, MD simulations were run
for 20 ns using a time step of 2 fs. During that period, the SHAKE
algorithm was used to constrain the lengths of all bonds involving
hydrogen atoms.34 For analysis, coordinates
were saved every 10 ps from the 20 ns simulation, that is, a total
of 2000 snapshots, and used for binding free energy calculations and
investigations, such as backbone heavy atoms relative to their initial
structure and radius of gyration of ligand (Figures S3 and S4). To understand the overall structural flexibility
of NPC1L1–NTD and their binding poses, a ligand-free NPC1L1–NTD
(called apo form of NPC1–NTD) was included
in the MD simulations. Subsequently, MM-PBSA-based binding free energies
were calculated to rank the experimentally observed binding affinity
of various sterols to the NTD of NPC1L1. The theoretical basis of
the MM-PBSA method used in the study is described in detail elsewhere.35 Briefly, the binding free energy of a protein–ligand
complex in an aqueous medium can be estimated based on the Gibbs free
energy scheme; however, because of heavy computational cost to estimate
solvent–solvent interactions, the binding free energy is calculated
using a thermodynamic cycle (eq 1), which relates the Gibbs free energy change upon binding
to the free energy difference between the bound and unbound states
in aqueous and vacuum environment, respectively. 1  

Each of the above contribution terms
can be calculated as a sum of three terms, as in eqs 2 and 3. 2   3  where EMM is the
interaction energy of the molecules, a measure of the enthalpic contribution
to the Gibbs free energy. EMM is the sum
of the internal energy (Eint) of the molecules
(i.e., bonded terms including bond and torsion angles), EEl and EvdW represent the
intermolecular electrostatic and van der Waals interactions energies
between the protein and the ligand, respectively. The term Gsolv refers to the Gibbs free energy of solvation
and consists of both polar and nonpolar solvation energies of the
molecule. Gsolv energies are estimated
based on the Poisson–Boltzmann approximation combined with
a solvent-accessible surface area calculation. The term SMM is the conformational entropy of the complex and is
typically estimated based on the harmonic approach calculated with
normal-mode analysis at the MM level.36 Because of high computational demands of this analysis and the fact
that normal-mode calculations only account for some but not all relevant
entropy contributions, we excluded the entropy term from the free
energy difference calculations. This is further justified by the fact
that we only consider relative binding affinities. The binding free
energies, that is, change in Gibbs free energy upon binding (ΔGbind), were calculated for all NPC1L1–NTD–sterol
complexes using the MMPBSA.py script being part of the Amber 14 package.37 The binding free energies of the ligand–protein
complex were extracted based on the single trajectory approach, and
no separate MD simulations were run for free ligands or the receptor.
Gibbs free energy contributions to binding in the decomposition analysis
can be negative or positive, meaning that a particular residue either
stabilizes or destabilizes the interaction with the ligand.

Computational Mutation Analysis
To better understand
the binding free energy difference of cholesterol in various clinically
relevant NPC1L1 mutants, additional calculations were carried out.
Relevant point mutations (i.e., T61M, I105A, L110M, T128A, N132S,
F205A, P215A, and L216A) underwent binding affinity calculations.
Each clinically relevant mutant structure was built from the wild-type
protein structure model using the “mutate residue” option
in the Maestro module in the Schrödinger suite.22 Subsequently, corresponding residues were energy
minimized to reduce the atomic clash between neighboring residues
using the OPLS-2005 force field,24 and
the resulting structures in complex with cholesterol were used as
the starting poses for MD simulations followed by MM-PBSA calculation,
as described above. Gibbs free energy contributions to binding in
the mutation analysis can be negative or positive, meaning that a
particular mutation either stabilizes or destabilizes the interaction
with the ligand compared to the wild-type complex.

Results and Discussion
Affinity Ranking of Sterol Ligands for NPC1L1–NTD in
Experiments and Simulations
Accumulating evidence suggests
that NPC1L1 mediates absorption of cholesterol into enterocytes from
the intestinal lumen but also into hepatocytes from the biliary compartment
in the liver.1 NPC1L1 also mediates intestinal
and hepatobiliary absorption of phytosterols, although to a lower
extent than that of cholesterol.1,38,39 These functions of the protein depend critically on sterol binding
to the NTD of NPC1L1 (NPC1L1–NTD). In the crystal structure
of the NPC1L1–NTD, the empty binding pocket appeared closed,
that is, not open, in contrast to the binding pocket of the NTD of
NPC1.12 Here, we have modeled the sterol-bound
conformation of the NTD of NPC1L1 based on that of NPC1 because that
has been determined also in complex with two sterols; cholesterol
and 25HCL (Figure S5).12,14 After optimizing the sterol–NTD complex of NPC1L1 (see Materials and Methods section), we have carried
out MD simulations and calculated the Gibbs free energy of binding
using the MM-PBSA approach. This computational method allows for accurate
ranking of various sterol ligands based on their binding free energy,
as we recently showed for the Niemann Pick C2 (NPC2) protein.25 Briefly, in MM-PBSA, one carries out MD simulations
here for each sterol–NPC1L1–NTD complex in the presence
of explicit water molecules using a classical force field. This generates
an ensemble of conformations, from which valid statistical thermodynamic
averages can be derived. To estimate various contributions to the
Gibbs free energy of binding, water is removed and replaced by an
implicit solvent description. Binding affinities are estimated by
calculating Gibbs free energy terms for the complex, the protein,
and the sterol ligand, separately. By performing such calculations
for NPC1L1–NTD in complex with various sterol ligands, we were
able to match the calculated binding affinity in good agreement to
that determined in two experimental studies (Figure 1). In the study of Zhang et al. (2011), a
titration assay was carried out at 4 °C for 24 h, in which 3H-cholesterol dissolved in an aqueous buffer containing ethanol
and the detergent Nonidet P-40 was found to bind to NPC1L1–NTD
in a sigmoidal fashion with an apparent KD = 0.17 μM and a Hill coefficient of 1.8.4 In the experiments by Kwon et al. (2011), a similar binding
assay was performed using 3H-cholesterol in a buffer containing
small amounts of the detergent NP-40.12 From the saturation binding curve, an apparent dissociation constant
of KD = 0.012 μM was inferred. At
saturation, 0.5 pmol of NPC1L1–NTD bound to 0.48 ± 0.04
pmol of 3H-cholesterol suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry of
cholesterol binding to NPC1L1–NTD.12 Remarkably, Kwon et al. (2011) report a more than 10-fold higher
affinity of NPC1L1–NTD to 3H-cholesterol compared
to that by Song and co-workers. The reason for the discrepancy in
these values is not clear. One possible explanation could lie in different
oligomerization states of the NPC1L1–NTD in both studies; whereas
Zhang et al. (2011) proposed that tetramerization of NPC1L1–NTD
results in cooperative binding of sterols; Kwon et al. (2011) found
a monomeric form of the NPC1L1–NTD, which bound sterols in
a fashion typical for 1:1 protein–ligand complexes.14,40 The sigmoid binding behavior observed in experiments by Zhang et
al. (2011) could be caused by a conformational transition of an eventual
NPC1L1–NTD tetramer from a low affinity to a high affinity
state upon ligand binding. However, a sigmoid binding curve could
also be an artifact caused by nonspecific binding of 3H-cholesterol
to detergent micelles, formation of additional cholesterol aggregates
to which NPC1L1–NTD also binds, or both.41 Finally, the protein solution contained an excess of bovine
serum albumin in the experiments by Zhang et al. (2011), which could
affect the shape of the binding curve as well as the estimated value
of the dissociation constant.40 Side-chain
oxidized cholesterol derivatives similar to 25HCL efficiently competed
for cholesterol binding to NPC1L1–NTD in both studies.12,40 In our simulations, cholesterol and 25HCL are strong binders, and
only one binding site could be identified, suggesting that the apparent
cooperativity observed in the experimental studies is not because
of multiple binding sites per NPC1L1–NTD molecule. In experiments
and our calculations, epicholesterol, stigmasterol, and β-sitosterol
bind with lower affinity compared to cholesterol (Figure 1A,B).12,40 Epicholesterol has the 3′-hydroxy group in the α-configuration,
whereas cholesterol and all other sterols used in this study have
this group in the β-configuration (Figure 1C). The 3′-hydroxy group in β-configuration
forms a hydrogen bond to Ser56 of the NPC1L1–NTD protein, which
is absent for epicholesterol (Figure S5). We suggest that this hydrogen bond is an important factor in stabilizing
sterol binding to NPC1L1–NTD. In fact, it has been shown that
shielded hydrogen bonds inside binding pockets impact ligand residence
times.42 This is because water molecules
must replace the ligand in the hydrogen bond upon ligand dissociation,
and water molecules are often hindered in their diffusion into a binding
pocket.42,43 Strong binding of 25HCL and cholesterol
but not of epicholesterol is also found for the NTD of NPC1, where
Asn41 plays the role of Ser56 in forming a hydrogen bound to the 3′-hydroxy
group in β- but not in the α-configuration, emphasizing
the similarity of both binding pockets (Figure S5).13,14 Stigmasterol and β-sitosterol
contain a branched propanyl side chain, which causes steric clashes
with residues in the upper part of the NPC1L1–NTD binding pose
(not shown). Consequently, their binding affinity is reduced compared
to that of sterols with unbranched alkyl chain (Figure 1A,B). Lanosterol is highly efficient in competing
for the binding of cholesterol to NPC1L1–NTD in experiments,14 whereas it has a somewhat lower affinity than
cholesterol in our MM-PBSA calculations (Figure 1A,B). The reason for this discrepancy is
not known at the moment.

logarithms of experimental relative affinities of sterol ligands to
NPC1L1–NTD, as measured by Zhang et al. (A) and by Kwon et
al. (B) were plotted against Gibbs free energies of binding calculated
using the MM-PBSA approach. Increasing the experimental affinity is
well-correlated with more negative binding energies. (C) List of sterols

group is colored red in all sterol ligands.

Gating Mechanism and Flexibility of NPC1L1–NTD upon Ligand
Binding
In the crystal structure, the NTD of NPC1L1 was shown
to be composed of nine α-helices flanked by three β-strands
and containing nine conserved disulfide bonds.12 This secondary structure is very similar to that of the
NTD of NPC1 indicating a similar sterol binding mode and molecular
function.14 Kwon et al. observed a remarkable
feature of the NTD of NPC1L1, namely that it is closed in its empty
conformation by a lid formed by a few residues around Leu192 (i.e.,
Leu213 in the original publication12).

This is in contrast to the NTD of NPC1, which remains open and accessible
to the solvent also after ligand release (see Figure S6 for the comparison of the NTDs of NPC1 and NPC1L1).14 We confirmed in MD simulations, that the site
of sterol entrance in NPC1L1–NTD is formed by Leu213, which
can reallocate to open and allow a sterol molecule to enter the binding
pose (Figure 2A). An
adjacent region formed by residues 189–194 (region 4; Figure 2B) and residues 168–175
(region 3) appeared to be highly flexible with large B-factors. Although Phe205, Gln206, and other residues reside on the
exterior site of the binding pose, Ser56 and Thr61 locate to the interior
of the binding pocket (Figure 2A). The flexibility of distinct regions of the NPC1L1–NTD
was preserved between the open, the cholesterol-bound, and the closed
ligand-free form, suggesting that sterol binding does not require
significant breathing motion of the protein (Figure 2B).44 In contrast,
the temporal behavior of molecular fluctuations of the ligand-free
NPC1L1–NTD is somehow different in the open and closed state:
by fitting a biexponential function to the time evolution of the B-factor during MD simulations, one finds that the NPC1L1–NTD
reaches thermodynamic equilibrium in less than 10 ns in the open form,
whereas it took significantly longer for the closed conformation,
likely exceeding the total simulation time of 20 ns (Figure S7). However, as we did not use the closed and ligand-free
conformation any further, this difference was not followed up on for
the purpose of this study. Together, we conclude that ligand binding
causes major conformational alterations in NPC1L1–NTD similar
to the reallocation of the gate centered at Leu213 resulting in an
increased structural flexibility of region 4, accompanied by reduced
mobility in regions 2 and 3 (Figure 2B).

the R-factors according to the X-ray structure with

lanosterol (LNS), β-sitosterol (bSTL), stigmosterol (SLT), and
epicholesterol (ECL).

NTD of NPC1L1 Binds Oxysterols and Intrinsically Fluorescent
Sterols Strongly
Using fluorescent cholesterol analogs in
binding assays and cellular transport studies requires minimizing
chemical alteration, which is necessary to create a fluorescent cholesterol
probe. For example, attaching a fluorophore to cholesterol can significantly
impact the binding properties, as shown in a variety of studies reviewed
in ref (45). DHE is
an intrinsically fluorescent cholesterol analog, which contains only
two additional conjugated double bonds in the steroid ring system
and another double bond and an extra methyl group in the side chain
compared to cholesterol (Figure S8).

CTL is an even closer analogue of cholesterol bearing only two additional
double bonds in the ring system compared to cholesterol. DHE and CTL
are often used in sterol binding and transfer assays, and with appropriate
microscope adaptions also employed as sterol probe in live-cell imaging
studies.46 We carried out MM-PBSA calculations
of NPC1L1–NTD in complex with DHE and CTL and found that both
fluorescent sterols bind to NPC1L1–NTD strongly. For DHE, the
binding affinity is predicted to be even higher than that for the
strongly binding ligands, cholesterol, and 25HCL (Table 1). In addition, we observed
that the complexes of NPC1L1–NTD with cholesterol, DHE, and
25HCL share the same overall structure stabilized by the same residues
at the interface between binding pose and ligand (Figure 3). In all three cases, the
free 3′-hydroxy group is buried inside the binding pocket,
forming a hydrogen bond to Ser56. There is enough space in the upper
part of the binding pose to account for the extra methyl group of
DHE, such that binding of this fluorescent sterol to NPC1L1–NTD
is predicted to be strong. To get further insights into the structural
determinants of the strong binding of these sterols to NPC1L1–NTD,
we decomposed the calculated binding free energy into contributions
of individual amino acids (Figure 4). Overall, we find a similar pattern of contributions
for cholesterol, 25HCL, and DHE (see correlation plots in Figure S9). Residues in the binding pocket such
as T128 have a negative free energy contribution for all sterol ligands,
despite varying magnitudes (Figures 4A and S10). Importantly,
this residue is conserved in the NTD of NPC1, where the corresponding
T112 was found to be important for sterol binding in experiments and
simulations.14,47 However, we also note that certain
residues contribute differently to the binding free energy for the
three sterol ligands. For example, the contribution of Glu38 is positive
for cholesterol (+2.49 ± 0.06 kcal/mol) and 25HCL (+0.93 ±
0.07 kcal/mol), whereas it is negative for DHE (−2.06 ±
0.04 kcal/mol). There are also some differences for cholesterol (−2.11
± 0.002 kcal/mol) compared to 25HCL (+0.48 ± 0.03 kcal/mol)
and DHE (+0.32 ± 0.01 kcal/mol) at Gln95 (Figure 4A). This residue is preserved between NPC1L1
and NPC1 (Figure S5), where mutation of
the corresponding Q79 into alanine completely abolishes binding of 3H-labeled 25HCL, whereas it strongly reduces the binding of 3H-cholesterol.13

Computational Mutation Analysis Identifies Key Residues in Sterol
Binding to NPC1L1–NTD
Song and co-workers (2011) based
on a study of Cohen et al. (2006) characterized some point mutations
in NPC1L1–NTD, which causes phenotypic alterations including
low cholesterol absorption (T61M, N132S) and reduced cholesterol uptake
in a cellular sterol uptake assay (T61M, L110F, I105A, T128A, N132S,
F205A, P215A, and L216A).17,48 With the exceptions
of Thr61 and Asn132, all of these residues in wild-type NPC1L1–NTD
give negative contributions to the binding affinity to cholesterol
in our calculations (see Figures 4A and S10). In particular,
residues belonging to the ligand facing alpha helix, Ile105 and Thr128,
and those on the opposite site of the binding pose in close proximity
to cholesterol, Phe205, and Pro215, give strongly negative energy
contributions, thus, stabilizing the binding interaction.

We
have estimated the difference in Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔΔG) of cholesterol to NPC1L1–NTDs in which these residues
have been mutated compared to the wild-type NPC1L1–NTD (Figure 5). Clinically relevant
mutations in T61, I105, L110, T128, P215, and L216 reduced the binding
energy in accordance with the experimental findings.40,48 Interestingly, such mutations are often associated with little change
in the structure of the binding pose, as exemplified for T61M, I105A,
and T128A in Figure S11. This has been
similarly observed for mutations in the NTD of NPC1 using alanine
mutagenesis and CD spectroscopy.13,14 Even though
the effect of the T61M mutation on the binding affinity is smaller
compared to most of the other mutations, it remains to be determined
why residues distal from the binding pocket such as T61 can affect
the binding affinity. Because the free energy contribution of T61
to the complex of wild-type NPC1L1–NTD with cholesterol is
small (Figure S10), a rather subtle effect
would be expected, and it is possible that methionine with its more
amphipathic character affects the structure locally. In the case of
mutation N132S, a slight increase in the binding affinity of cholesterol
to NPC1L1–NTD was found, whereas the mutation F205A increased
the affinity significantly (Figure 5B). The reason for this discrepancy between experiment
and simulations for these two residues is currently unknown. To better
understand the binding energetics of the F205A mutant, we carried
out an energy decomposition analysis in the presence of the ligand
cholesterol and compared that to the decomposition for the wild-type
NPC1L1–NTD (Figure 6). There are several residues, such as Val55, Ser56, Glu38,
Asn54, Leu99, Tyr156, and Gln206, which have much more negative free
energy contributions to the total binding energy in the F205A mutant
compared to the wild type, suggesting that they compensate for the
loss of F205. In addition, many residues give slightly more negative
values in the mutant, suggesting that mutating the bulky Phe205 at
the entrance of the binding pose into Ala205 allows for tighter overall
fitting of cholesterol in the binding pocket of NPC1L1–NTD.
Why does radioactive cholesterol bind less tightly in a biochemical
binding assay to the F205A mutant compared to the wild-type NPC1L1–NTD?
One explanation could be experimental discrepancies, for example,
impaired folding stability of the mutant. Alternatively, one can speculate
that Phe205 is important in guiding cholesterol into the binding pocket,
that is, to lower the activation energy for binding and thereby increasing
the binding rate constant, kon. This process
is not explicitly considered in MM-PBSA calculations, which—after
docking and MD simulation—instead only considers the end states
of the binding process. Combined experimental and computational analysis
of binding kinetics could shed light on the role played by Phe205
in future studies.

regression was carried out for all residues (r2 = 0.81), except those in red, which have significantly more
negative contributions in the mutant. Two residues with strongly altered
ΔG are shown in yellow.

Conclusions
NPC1L1 is highly expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes
and hepatocytes, where this protein is involved in cholesterol transport
from mixed bile salt micelles across the extracellular glycocalyx
and into the apical plasma membrane. A key to this function is the
sterol binding capacity of the NPC1L1–NTD. In this study, we
have carried out a detailed computational analysis of the binding
mechanisms of various sterol ligands to the NPC1L1–NTD. We
can confirm the experimentally determined ranking of binding affinities
of various sterols and provide structural details of the binding mechanisms.
Binding of sterols bearing their 3′-hydroxy group in β-configuration,
such as cholesterol or 25HCL, is stabilized by a hydrogen bond at
Ser56, which is replaced by Asn41 in the NTD of NPC1 (Figure S6 and ref (14)). We find that some of the key residues mediating
sterol binding are conserved between NPC1L1–NTD and NPC1–NTD
(e.g., Q95 vs Q79, E30 vs E38, and T112 vs T128 (Figure S6)). Those residues have been implicated in control
of the sterol transfer between NPC1–NTD and NPC2.14,47,49 However, it is important to note
that there are also residues in NPC1–NTD whose mutation leads
to an NPC disease phenotype and which have no counterparts in NPC1L1–NTD.
For example, Q92, which corresponds to A108 in NPC1L1–NTD,
is located next to the pocket entrance (Figure S12), where it stabilizes the opening and overall structure
of the NPC1–NTD binding pose.50 Mutations
Q92R and Q92S in NPC1–NTD are known to give a severe clinical
phenotype.50,51 It is likely that the majority
of these nonconserved residues leading to NPC disease is involved
in docking to or sterol transfer from NPC2 or plays other functional
roles apart from sterol binding. This is supported by the observations
that distinct subdomains in NPC1–NTD and NPC2 are involved
in sterol binding versus sterol transfer.14,49

It is possible that NPC1L1 needs a sterol binding protein aka NPC2
to take up cholesterol from the lumen of intestine or bile compartment,
but so far no such interaction partner has been reported. Cholesterol,
and to a lower extent 25HCL and other oxysterols, are hydrophobic
molecules, and NPC2 likely binds them in the lysosome to prevent formation
of sterol micelles or aggregates.52 Because
both the digestive and bile juice contain bile salts, cholesterol
is likely emulsified by these detergents making sterol binding proteins
as a counterpart to NPC2 obsolete. On the other hand, residues in
NPC1L1–NTD whose mutation leads to impaired cholesterol uptake
into enterocytes have been described. We demonstrate that particular
residues whose mutation is associated with this phenotype, such as
low intestinal cholesterol absorption and plasma LDL levels (e.g.,
T61, L110F, and N132), defective cholesterol binding (e.g., L216A),
or impaired cholesterol transport function shown for the related NPC1–NTD
(i.e., Q95), contribute significantly to the overall binding energy
of cholesterol to NPC1L1–NTD. We also show that most clinically
observed mutations of NPC1L1 result in reduced binding energies to
cholesterol, thereby providing a molecular explanation for the observed
phenotypes. There are also few selected mutants which increase the
binding affinity in our calculations, and we show in a free energy
decomposition analysis that this is because of distant residues whose
interaction with the sterol ligand increases, thereby compensating
for the mutation. Additional defects in clinical mutants, such as
impaired endocytosis or recycling through endosomes compared to wild-type
NPC1L1,48 seem to be independent of the
sterol binding capacity of the NPC1L1–NTD, as also suggested
in recent experiments.53 Together, our
study provides a molecular picture of sterol binding to NPC1L1 and
of alterations in this process associated with clinical phenotypes.
