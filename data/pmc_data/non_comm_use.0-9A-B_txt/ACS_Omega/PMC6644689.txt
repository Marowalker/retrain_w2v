Owing to its simple operation and minimal generation of pollutants,
miniemulsion polymerization has attracted increasing interest in the
field of inkjet printing. In this study, different dyes were encapsulated
with styrene-co-butyl acrylate copolymers via miniemulsion
polymerization. The encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles were spherical
with an apparent shell–core structure, narrow size distributions,
and good thermal stability. These nanoparticles were used as miniemulsion
inks that could remain unchanged with good photostability for a long
time. The miniemulsion ink was successfully applied to inkjet printing
on paper with bright colors and good fluency, and the dyeing of cotton
fabrics indicated that these nanoparticles possessed good rubbing
and washing fastness. All of these results suggest that the miniemulsion
ink is a potential substitute for inks based on traditional dyes in
inkjet printing.

1 Introduction
Inkjet printing technology has attracted attention
owing to the advantages of high resolution, low pollution, short working
path, quick response, low consumption of water and energy, and little
or no wastage of dye1−5 compared with
conventional printing technologies such as lithography, flexography,
and screen printing.6−8 Inks
based on reactive, acids, disperse dyes, and pigments have been widely
used in the inkjet printing of textiles. However, the pigment particles
tend to agglomerate in aqueous or nonaqueous solvents owing to their
high surface area and the substantial van der Waals forces acting
between particles;9,10 this agglomeration poses serious
problems during the jetting of inks, such as clogging the nozzles
of the inkjet printer.11 In contrast, dye-based
inks exhibit excellent color reproduction, admirable stability, humidity
resistance, ozone resistance, and color balance.12 Compared with pigment-based inks, however, they have poor
light permanency and water resistance.13−15 Furthermore, traditional dye-based inks usually comprise
many additives such as surfactants, moisturizers, defoamers, dispersants,
solvents,16,17 and even binders, resulting in environmental
pollution and the wastage of resources. In this regard, encapsulating
dyes with a polymer is considered an alternative way to improve water
resistance, light fastness, and firmness of dyes in the condition
of irradiation and washing.

Miniemulsion polymerization is a
versatile technique used for synthesizing a broad range of polymers
and structured materials in confined geometries. Compared with the
traditional emulsion polymerization technique, miniemulsion polymerization
has the advantages of convenience, environmental friendliness, controllable
particle size, and high stability.18−23 The droplet nucleation mechanism
in miniemulsion polymerization promotes the even dispersion of nanoparticles24,25 and eliminates the effects of compound structures on the encapsulated
nanoparticles.20,26,27 Thus,
miniemulsion polymerization has been applied in various areas, including
textile pigments,11,28 binders,29,30 molecular
imprinting,31,32 and encapsulation.33,34 Some studies have investigated the encapsulation of pigments via
miniemulsion polymerization; however, to the best of our knowledge,
studies on the encapsulation of dyes have not been conducted yet.

In this study, encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles were prepared
via miniemulsion polymerization. Scheme 1 illustrates the encapsulation mechanism
of the dye via miniemulsion polymerization. Styrene-co-butyl acrylate (St-BA) copolymer latexes acted as the polymer shell,
an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was used to stabilize
the miniemulsion, and hexadecane was employed as a costabilizer for
miniemulsion preparation, which can form an interface barrier on the
surface of the droplet to delay the migration of monomer droplets
from a small droplet to a larger one. Various monomer ratios were
optimized to acquire the appropriate glass-transition temperature
(Tg) and good thermal properties of the
copolymers and encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles. The particle
size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, stability, printing behavior,
and other physical properties such as viscosity, surface tension,
and zeta potential of the encapsulated dyes were studied. Finally,
the encapsulated dyes were used to print on cotton fabrics, and the
dry and wet rubbing fastness and washing fastness of the fabrics were
studied.

Miniemulsion Polymerization
2 Results and
Discussion
2.1 Particle
Size and Polydispersity Analysis
To demonstrate an effective
encapsulation of the dye molecules (Solvent Yellow 163) by the polymer,
the particle size and particle size distribution of the polymer and
encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles were analyzed using dynamic
light scattering (DLS). As described in Figure 1, the sizes of P (St/BA) and P (St/BA/dye)
varied from 28 to 140 nm and 75 to 220 nm, respectively. P (St/BA/dye)
had larger particle sizes and a wider particle size distribution compared
with P (St/BA). Therefore, we can conclude that the dyes were successfully
encapsulated by the polymer, and both P (St/BA) and P (St/BA/dye)
had very narrow particle size distributions. Figure S2 shows the dependence of the particle size and polydispersity
index (PDI) of St-BA copolymer nanoparticles on reaction time; a total
of 7 h were required to complete the reaction.

Figure 1 Particle size distributions
of P (St/BA) (A) and P (St/BA/dye) (B).

2.2 Effect of Monomer Ratio and Dye Type on Ink
Performance
As shown in Table 1, the monomer ratio has little effect on the particle
size, PDI, zeta potential, surface tension, and viscosity with the
increased concentration of BA in the comonomer. The average particle
size, zeta potential, and PDI were approximately 125 nm, −7.8
mV, and 0.11, respectively. All these results indicate that the encapsulated
dye/polymer nanoparticles have excellent stability, which will not
be affected by the monomer ratio. The surface tension and viscosity
of the ink dispersion were approximately 46 mN/m and 1.5 mPa·s,
respectively (Table 1), both of which meet the requirements for inkjet printing,35 as the required surface tension and viscosity
for inks are 25–60 mN/m and 1–3 mPa·s, respectively. Figure S3 describes the effect of SDS on the
diameter, PDI, zeta potential, and surface tension of encapsulated
Solvent Yellow 163 dye/polymer nanoparticles. In this study, 0.2 g
SDS was chosen as the most appropriate amount for droplet nucleation
and inkjet printing. Miniemulsion polymerization is different from
conventional emulsion polymerization because it employs a miniemulsification
process achieved via ultrasonic or high-shear treatment. The effect
of the ultrasound power is shown in Figure S4.

Table 1 Effect of Monomer Ratio on Ink Performance
monomer ratio	diameter (nm)	PDI	zeta potential (mV)	surface tension (mN/m)	viscosity (mPa·s)	
9:1	125	0.089	–7.79	45.76	1.40	
8:2	124	0.129	–7.67	46.94	1.43	
7:3	125	0.098	–8.00	48.76	1.48	
6:4	123	0.127	–7.71	43.29	1.78	
The dye type has negligible effect on the particle size,
PDI, surface tension, and viscosity; their values were approximately
125 nm, 0.1, 43 mN/m, and 1.5 mPa·s, respectively (Table 2). These phenomena also proved
that there were no specific material requirements for encapsulation
by polymers in a miniemulsion polymerization process. Therefore, miniemulsion
polymerization can be widely applied in many technological fields.

2.3 Infrared Spectroscopy
of Solvent Yellow 163, P (St/BA), and P (St/BA/Dye)
Figure 2A shows the infrared
spectroscopy of Solvent Yellow 163, and Figure 2B shows the infrared spectroscopy of P (St/BA)
and P (St/BA/dye). The dye refers to the Solvent Yellow 163. We can
apparently discover that the characteristic peaks of Solvent Yellow
163 are shielded in P (St/BA/dye), especially the peaks at 1665.44,
1572.39, 1307.30, and 1242.06 cm–1. This result
indicates that Solvent Yellow 163 molecules have been successfully
encapsulated in polymers. As shown in Figure 2 B, the peak at 3438.80 cm–1 is broad, resulting from hydroxyl stretching vibration from water.
The peaks at 3082.50 and 3026.76 cm–1 are attributed
to the stretching vibrations of unsaturated hydrocarbons (=C–H)
on aromatic rings, and the peaks at 2925.45 and 2851.83 cm–1 are attributed to saturated hydrocarbons (−C–H). The
−C=O peak at 1729.65 cm–1 originates
from the stretching vibration of the ester group in BA. The peaks
at 1601.20 and 1493.17 cm–1 represent the stretching
vibrations of the aromatic ring skeleton (C=C) and those at
758.67 and 699.21 cm–1 represent the deformation
vibrations of the aromatic ring skeleton (Ar–H). Moreover,
the peaks at 758.67 and 699.21 cm–1 are typical
position of monosubstituted benzene rings. The peaks at 1159.18 and
1066.62 cm–1 represent the asymmetric and symmetric
stretching vibrations of C–O–C, respectively. Because
no peaks appear between 1630 and 1680 cm–1, no C=C
from St exists in the copolymer, indicating that the St and BA are
well copolymerized. The structural formula of the copolymer is listed
in Figure S5.

2.4 Thermal Properties and Encapsulation Efficiency
of the Encapsulated Dye/Polymer Nanoparticles
The thermal
properties of the polymer latex and the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles
were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), respectively. As shown in Figure 3, the thermal properties of
the P (St/BA/Solvent Yellow 163), P (St/BA) latex, and Solvent Yellow
163 dye were obtained. The TGA curve shows a weight-loss process with
increasing temperature. There is only one degradation temperature
between 100 and 200 °C for Solvent Yellow 163 dye with a weight
loss of 97%, which is caused by the decomposition of the anthraquinone
in Solvent Yellow 163. There are two degradation temperatures for
P (St/BA) latex particles. The first is between 90 and 120 °C
with a weight loss of 11%, which might be due to the evaporation of
water in the polymer latex. The second degradation temperature occurs
between 350 and 440 °C with a weight loss of 77%, indicating
the removal of the St-BA copolymer latex. Furthermore, there are three
degradation temperatures for P (St/BA/Solvent Yellow 163). The first
is between 70 and 100 °C with a weight loss of 15%, which may
be due to the evaporation of water in the polymer latex, leaving hexadecane
and the surfactant. The second degradation temperature occurs between
130 and 180 °C with a weight loss of 14%, which is caused by
the decomposition of the anthraquinone of Solvent Yellow 163. The
last degradation temperature occurs between 370 and 420 °C with
a weight loss of 62%, indicating the removal of the St-BA copolymer
latex. According to the thermogravimetric curves of P (St/BA/Solvent
Yellow 163) and Solvent Yellow 163, we can conclude that the encapsulated
dye/polymer nanoparticles have much better thermal properties.

Figure 3 TGA thermogram
of Solvent Yellow 163, P (St/BA), and P (St/BA/dye).

The encapsulation efficiency of Solvent Yellow 163 was obtained from
TGA results. With the initial weight of 2.544 mg and the final weight
of 0.091 mg, the encapsulation efficiency of Solvent Yellow 163 with
a monomer ratio of 8/2 (St/BA) was calculated to be 39% using the
aforementioned formula. In general, the encapsulation efficiencies
of dyes with the St-BA copolymer showed higher values than those with
a BA-methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymer. This result may be attributed
to the lower polarity and higher hydrophobicity of the St-BA latexes
in comparison to the BA-MMA latexes.11

The Tg is an important index that is
related to the softness of film on substrates of the ink for inkjet
printing. By fitting the smooth part of a DSC curve, Tg values of the copolymer and encapsulated dye/polymer
nanoparticles can be obtained. The DSC curves of St-BA copolymer latexes
prepared using miniemulsion and conventional emulsion polymerization
are shown in Figure 4. Conventional emulsion polymerization was used for comparison to
prove that miniemulsion polymerization did not change the thermal
properties of the St-BA copolymer latex. It can be observed that the
two curves exhibit the same trend and characteristics, suggesting
that they have the same Tg (68 °C
with a monomer ratio of 9/1) and similar thermal properties. St is
a hard monomer with a very high Tg of
95 °C, whereas BA is a soft monomer with a relatively low Tg of −55 °C.36 Therefore, it is possible to achieve different Tg by controlling the monomer ratios. The Tg values of the encapsulated Solvent Yellow
163 with the St-BA copolymer latexes ranged from 22.14 to 61.23 °C
by varying the monomer ratios from 6/4 to 9/1 (St/BA). The addition
of BA can lower the Tg of the encapsulated
dye/polymer nanoparticles (Figure S6) and
improve the softness of cotton fabrics.

of the St/BA copolymer latex (St/BA = 8/2) and P (St/BA/dye).

2.5 Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)
The morphology and particle size of the encapsulated dye/polymer
nanoparticles and St-BA copolymer latexes were studied using TEM.
The St-BA copolymer latex with a monomer ratio of 8/2 has an average
diameter of 85 nm, as shown in Figure S7. TEM images of encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles are shown
in Figure 5. We can
clearly conclude that both encapsulated Solvent Yellow 163/polymer
and Solvent Yellow 43/polymer are regular spherical nanoparticles
with an apparent shell–core structure having a total diameter
of approximately 100 nm, a core diameter of 80 nm, and a shell thickness
of 20 nm. Compared with the DLS result, we can find differences in
the particle size and particle dispersibility; DLS exhibits a hydrodynamic
size that corresponds to the core and the swollen corona of the micelles,
whereas TEM often exhibits the size of the core for micelles in a
dried state as the corona with low electronic density is not visible.37

and (B) Solvent Yellow 43.

2.6 Stability of the Ink Dispersions
The stability of ink dispersions
is an important aspect when evaluating the performance of an ink.
The stability can affect the particle size distribution of the dye
particles, color fastness, and photostability of the inks, further
affecting the image quality in inkjet printing. The results of the
centrifugal stability tests of the miniemulsion inks are shown in Figure 6. No stratification
or agglomeration was observed after centrifugation for 0.5 h, followed
by storing for 3, 6, and 9 months, suggesting that the miniemulsion
inks have excellent stability.

of the inks (A) stored
for 3 months, (B) stored for 6 months, and (C) stored for 9 months.

2.7 Photostability
It is known that significant fading
of dye inks under UV irradiation outdoor occurs within a month. Therefore,
the light stabilities of the miniemulsion inks were investigated.
As shown in Figure 7, the four different colored inks exhibit excellent light stabilities.
The diluted ink was illuminated continuously for 6 h under a 500 W
iodine–tungsten lamp, and the absorbance of Solvent Yellow
43, Solvent Yellow 163, Disperse Red 60, and Solvent Blue 36 only
decreased by 8.7, 7.9, 9.5, and 8.9%, respectively. The higher absorbance
of Solvent Yellow 43 makes it more suitable for inkjet printing compared
with the other dyes.

curves of Solvent Yellow 43, Solvent Yellow 163, Disperse Red 60,

iodine–tungsten lamp.

2.8 Dyeing Cotton Fabrics and Inkjet Printing on Paper with Encapsulated
Dye/Polymer Nanoparticles
The encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles
were used for dyeing cotton fabrics. The inks showed a superior dyeing
effect with vivid colors and even coloration (Figure 8). The dyeing experiments were performed
at room temperature without any heating process, which differs from
dyeing experiments using reactive dyes. Reactive dyes require high
temperatures for the dye molecules to react with fabrics, whereas
the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles have no special temperature
requirements for using on a fabric. Inkjet printing images on paper
with encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles are shown in Figure S8.

Figure 8 Pictures of
cotton fabrics dyed with Solvent
Yellow 43 (A), Solvent Yellow 163 (B), Disperse Red 60 (C), and Solvent
Blue 36 (D).

Four different colored inks
were used to dye cotton fabrics. It can be seen from Table 3 that all of the inks exhibit
good washing and rubbing fastness. Solvent Yellow 43 and Solvent Yellow
163 show better washing and rubbing fastness compared with Disperse
Red 60 and Solvent Blue 36. The dry rubbing fastness of the four inks
is better than the wet rubbing fastness. Overall, it seems that the
fastness toward rubbing and washing of the fabrics after dyeing can
meet the criteria of standard tests.

3 Conclusions
The encapsulation of dyes
with hard St and soft BA via miniemulsion polymerization was systematically
studied herein. The encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles were applied
for inkjet printing without the addition of a binder. During the inkjet
printing process, nozzles did not clog. The encapsulated dye/polymer
nanoparticles were spherical with a regular shape and an apparent
shell–core structure with a diameter of approximately 100 nm.
The surfactant SDS significantly influenced the miniemulsion polymerization
process; the particle size, PDI, surface tension, and zeta potential
of the ink dispersion decreased with increasing SDS amount. The sonication
power was optimized to be 50% to obtain a favorable particle size
distribution without damaging the instrument. The ink type and monomer
ratios were found to have a negligible effect on the ink properties.
The encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles showed good thermal stability
and a high encapsulation efficiency (39%) based on the DSC and TGA
results. The photostability and centrifugal stability experiments
proved that the miniemulsion inks had excellent stability even after
9 months. Moreover, the absorbance of the inks slightly decreased
after illumination by a 500 W iodine–tungsten lamp for 6 h.
The results of inkjet printing on paper with different encapsulated
dyes suggested that the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles provided
bright colors and good fluency without the clogging of nozzles. The
cotton fabric dyeing experiments with miniemulsion inks indicate that
encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles have good rubbing and washing
fastness.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
St and BA monomers were purified via distillation under reduced
pressure to remove the polymerization inhibitor before use and were
then stored in a refrigerator. Potassium persulfate (KPS, Aladdin,
99%) was purified by recrystallization from water prior to use. SDS
(Energy, 98%), n-hexadecane (HD, Energy, 98%), and
sodium hydrogen carbonate (AR) were used without further treatment.
Deionized (DI) water was used in all waterborne polymerizations. Figure S1 describes the chemical structures of
different organic dyes. Cotton fabric (100% bleached, plain weaved,
140 g/m2) was used as the substrate for the encapsulated
dye/polymer nanoparticles.

4.2 Miniemulsion Polymerization and Encapsulation of Dyes
4.2.1 Miniemulsion Preparation and
Polymerization
Table 4 lists the generic miniemulsion polymerization components.
An aqueous phase was prepared by dispersing 0.2 g SDS surfactant in
40 g DI water, which was then stirred for 30 min. An oil phase of
monomers and hexadecane was mixed and stirred for 30 min. The oil
phase was then slowly added to the aqueous phase and stirred for 1
h to fully mix the two phases. Miniemulsification was achieved via
sonication of the mixture for 10 min at 50% power using an ultrasonic
cell crusher (SCIENTZ IID). To prevent the occurrence of self-polymerization
of St during the sonication process, this process was performed in
an ice bath. The miniemulsion was then transferred into a four-neck
flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a reflux condenser, a nitrogen
inlet, and a thermometer. The system was first stirred at 300 rpm,
purged with nitrogen for 5 min, and heated to 85 °C in a water
bath; the polymerization reaction was then initiated by injecting
KPS solution and maintained for another 7 h.

4.2.2 Encapsulation of Dyes with St-BA Copolymer
Latexes
The dyes (5 g) were directly dissolved in 10 g comonomer
without any other solvent and magnetically stirred for 1 h at room
temperature (25 °C) to prevent polymerization of the monomers.
The mixture of monomers and dyes was then added to an SDS solution
and stirred for 1 h. The remaining steps are similar to those for
the miniemulsion polymerization.

4.3 Miniemulsion Characterization
4.3.1 Particle Size and Polydispersity Analysis
The particle size, size distribution, and morphology were determined
using various techniques such as DLS and TEM.

DLS measurements
were performed on a nanoparticle and zeta potential analyzer (Nano
ZS90) to obtain size distributions, average particle sizes, and the
PDI. The ink dispersion was diluted 200 times with distilled water
and subsequently sonicated for 10 min in an ultrasonic cell crusher
before performing the measurements. The diluents were then placed
into the sample pool and analyzed at an angle of 90°.

A
Tecnai F30 transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage
of 300 kV was used to obtain further information about the morphology
and particle size of the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles as
well as the copolymer latex particles. For the sample preparation,
approximately 10 μL of dilute samples (200 times diluted using
DI water) of the ink dispersions were dropped onto a copper-coated
carbon grid and dried at room temperature before being positioned
in the electron microscope.

4.3.2 Centrifugal Stability Test
Centrifugal stability tests
were performed on a high-speed centrifuge (HC-3028, Anhui USTC Zonkia
Scientific Instruments Co., Ltd). The ink dispersion was centrifuged
for 30 min at a rotating speed of 8000 rpm. It should be noted that
the tests were performed after 3, 6, and 9 months.

4.3.3 Zeta (ζ) Potential
The zeta potential of the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles
was measured using a nanoparticle and zeta potential analyzer (Nano
ZS90) at 20 °C.

4.3.4 Surface Tension
A surface tension meter (KRUSS100C)
was used to measure the surface tension of the ink dispersion at 20
°C. The surface tension of DI water (70.97 mN m–1) was tested in advance to standardize the test result. The sample
cell was washed with DI water, and the test probe was sterilized using
an alcohol lamp before testing the surface tension of the ink dispersion
(100 mL).

4.3.5 Viscosity
Measurement
Viscosity measurements were performed on a BROOKFIELD
DV-II+P rotary viscometer (USA). All measurements were performed at
20 °C using a No.0 rotor. Approximately 20 mL ink was dispersed.

4.3.6 Infrared Spectroscopy
Infrared spectroscopy was performed on a high-order Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer (6700). The sample was dried and pulverized
after demulsification, and the resulting powder was characterized
via total reflection absorption on a high-order Fourier transform
infrared spectrometer over a wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm–1 with a step size of 0.02 cm–1.

4.3.7 Differential Scanning
Calorimetry
DSC (Q20) was used to obtain the Tg of the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles at different
monomer ratios. The miniemulsion was destroyed by a demulsifier solution
of 5 wt % sodium chlorides. The residue was dried, grinded, and then
characterized using a differential scanning calorimeter to determine
its thermal behavior. The DSC test involved two heating cycles over
a temperature range of 0–100 °C (0–30 min). Tg is a crucial factor for evaluating the softness
of the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles, and the Solvent Yellow
163 dye was particularly studied herein.

4.3.8 Thermal Gravimetric Analysis
The
thermal behavior of the encapsulated dye/polymer nanoparticles was
investigated using TGA (Q500). Powders of the encapsulated dye/polymer
nanoparticles were dried in an infrared drying oven and heated to
800 °C in a gold crucible at a heating rate of 10 °C/min
under flowing nitrogen gas to obtain their decomposition behavior.

The encapsulation efficiency of the encapsulated Solvent Yellow
163 dye/polymer nanoparticles was determined from the TGA data. The
specific formula is given below 1  where the theoretical
weight of the Solvent Yellow 163 dye is calculated as follows:  2  

4.3.9 Photostability Experiments
Absorption spectra were
measured on a PerkinElmer Lambda 35 UV/vis spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer)
to investigate the photostability of miniemulsion dye inks. The ink
dispersion was diluted using DI water by a factor of 200, placed into
cuvettes, and then illuminated continuously for 6 h under a 500 W
iodine–tungsten lamp. The absorbance was taken every 10 min
for 1 h and every 30 min for the next 5 h.

4.4 Application of Encapsulated Dye/Polymer
Nanoparticles for the Inkjet Printing of Paper and Dyeing of Cotton
Fabrics
The encapsulated dyes exhibited superior water solubility.
The inks included 80, 0.3, 0.1, and 19.6% of (weight percentage) miniemulsion
ink, surfactant (gas 465), defoamer (gas 104), and moisturizer (ethylene
glycol), respectively. Inks without the addition of binders were applied
to inkjet printing on paper and dyeing of cotton fabrics. The dry
and wet rubbing fastness and washing fastness were measured using
a rubbing fastness tester (YB571-II) and a digital color fastness
and color automatic rating system (DigiEye-A), respectively.
