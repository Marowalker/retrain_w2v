With the goal of improving the removal
of anionic contaminants,
copper oxide (CuO)-modified biochar (BC) nanocomposites were successfully
prepared through simply ball milling CuO particles with BC. The physicochemical
properties of the fabricated CuO/BC nanocomposites were systematically
characterized by a series of techniques; their adsorption performances
were assessed, and the main adsorption mechanism was revealed. X-ray
powder diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy analyses of the nanocomposites showed the
strong interaction between CuO and BC and confirmed the success of
the ball-milling syntheses. Because of strong electrostatic attraction
between the embedded CuO nanoparticles and reactive red (RR120), the
composited adsorbents exhibited excellent RR120 removal. The 10%-CuO/BC
nanocomposite achieved the best RR120 removal efficiency (46%), which
is much higher than that of pristine BC (20%). In addition, the adsorption
was insensitive to the change of solution initial pH (4–10).
The 10%-CuO/BC also showed fast adsorption kinetics (equilibrium time <
3 h) and extremely high adsorption capacity (Langmuir maximum capacity
of 1399 mg g–1) to RR120 in aqueous solutions. Findings
from this study demonstrate not only the strong feasibility of ball-milling
synthesis of BC-based nanocomposites but also the promising potential
of the CuO/BC nanocomposites to remove aqueous anionic contaminants.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Biochar
(BC) is an emerging carbonaceous and porous material formed
via pyrolysis of a wide range of organic matters such as crop straw,
manure, municipal waste, and industrial byproducts under oxygen-limited
conditions. It has dramatically attracted attention in agriculture,
climate change mitigation, energy production, and environmental remediation.1−4 Owing to its advantageous properties including large surface area,
high porosity, abundant surface functional groups, rich aromaticity,
relatively low cost, as well as excellent ion exchange capacity, BC
is regarded as a practical alternative cost-effective adsorbent to
eliminate both organic and inorganic pollutants (i.e., heavy metals,
organic compounds, and possibly nutrients).5−7

In comparison
to other engineered carbonaceous adsorbents such
as activated carbon, pristine/virgin BC often has lower adsorption
capacity to a range of aqueous contaminants, especially organics and
heavy metals. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that pristine
BC exhibits little adsorption ability to anionic species (e.g., reactive
red dye) in water because its surface is often negatively charged
under natural conditions.8,9 The modification of
BC with nanosized metal oxides to form nanocomposites thus has been
proposed as an effective way to enhance BC’s adsorption properties.10

Numerous research studies have shown that
the introduction of metal
oxide particles onto BC can enhance its sorption capacity to various
aqueous pollutants.11 On one hand, metal
oxides on a BC surface may serve as positively charged sorption sites
and thus increase the removal of anionic contaminants by the composites.12 On the other hand, BC with a porous structure
can support the distribution and stabilization of metal oxide particles
in the nanocomposites.13 Currently, metal
oxide BC composites are mainly produced through two routes including
pretreatment of biomass using metal oxide precursors and post-treatment
of BC to introduce metal oxide particles.14,15 For instance, Zhang et al. prepared MgO/BC nanocomposites using
MgCl2·6H2O as the precursor via a one-pot
direct pyrolysis method and the resultant nanocomposites showed excellent
ionic contamination removal efficiencies.16 Yao et al. pyrolyzed Mg-enriched tomato tissues to obtain a novel
engineered BC with strong adsorption ability to phosphate in aqueous
solutions.17 Cope et al. used an evaporative
method to amend iron oxide particles into BC and the composite showed
approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher arsenate adsorptive level
than an iron oxide-modified sand.18 These
methods require metallic solution impregnation and copyrolysis processes,
which discharge wastewater and gas emission, and thus impose contamination
risks to the environment.19

High-energy
ball milling, a mechanochemistry activation process,
has gained considerable attention recently in the fabrication of novel
engineered nanomaterials including nanocomposites under solvent-free
conditions.20 Ball milling can reduce particle
size and increase specific surface area (SSA), thereby introducing
new active edge sites to improve adsorption capacity.21,22 Shan et al. successfully synthesized two magnetic nanocomposites,
BC/Fe3O4 and activated carbon/Fe3O4, via the ball-milling method.23 Gu et al. prepared a ZnO@sulphur/carbon nanotube nanocomposite through
the ball-milling method and the nanocomposite was applied as a cathode
material for high-performance Li–S batteries.24

Copper oxide (CuO), a great p-type semiconductor
with a narrow
band gap of 1.2 eV, has attracted full attention as a capable photocatalyst
under irradiation of sunlight.25 Several
studies have indicated that BC modified with CuO can increase the
porosity,26 enlarge the surface area,27 reduce the sensitivity of BC to solution pH
value,28 and introduce hydrophilic environment
over BC.29 All these changes could improve
the adsorption capacity of BC to different kinds of aqueous contaminants.
To the best of our knowledge, however, none of the previous studies
has used the ball-milling method to synthesize CuO/BC nanocomposites.

As the first of its kind, we synthesized novel CuO/BC nanocomposites
using a facile solvent-free ball-milling method and evaluated their
sorption performances. An anionic dye, reactive red 120 (RR120), was
selected as a model contaminant compound because of its frequent occurrence
in colored effluents and easy detection. RR120 is widely used in industrial
sectors, and relatively hard to degrade because of its large molecular
weight and complex aromatic structure.30 The objectives of this work are to: (1) optimize ball-milling conditions
of CuO/BC nanocomposites; (2) characterize their physicochemical properties;
and (3) determine the adsorption behaviors and mechanisms of RR120
on CuO/BC nanocomposites.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Optimal Ball-Milling Parameters and Comparison
of Adsorbents
Because CuO was the modification agent of the
nanocomposites, the ball-milling conditions were optimized based on
the sorption capacity of CuO to RR120. CuO powder were ball milled
under different combinations of ball-milling time, speed, and agate
ball-to-CuO mass ratio. The adsorption capacities of the ball-milled
samples to RR120 are shown in Figure 1a–c. Whereas the ball-milling time (Figure 1a) and agate ball-to-CuO
mass ratio (Figure 1b) had little effect on RR120 adsorption onto CuO, the milling speed
(Figure 1c) showed
greater influences. The highest RR120 adsorption capacities under
different ball-milling conditions were 65.38, 66.54, and 63.56 mg
g–1at a milling time of 9 h, balls-to-CuO weight
ratio of 50:1, and speed of 400 rpm, respectively. These conditions
were then used to prepare all the subsequent CuO/BC nanocomposites
of different CuO contents.

Figure 1 RR120 sorption capacity onto CuO prepared with
different milling
(a) time, (b) mass ratio, and (c) speed; and (d) effect of CuO content
on RR120 adsorption onto CuO/BC nanocomposites.

In comparison of BC–BM, all the CuO/BC nanocomposites showed
higher removal of RR120 from aqueous solutions, reflecting the strong
RR120 adsorption ability of CuO particles in the nanocomposites (Figure 1d). The RR120 adsorption
capacity first increased with CuO content and 10%-CuO/BC had the best
performance with a RR120 adsorption capacity of 57.59 mg g–1, 58% higher than that of BC–BM (24.37 mg g–1). Further increase of the amount of CuO in the composites, however,
reduced the adsorption of RR120 onto the CuO/BC nanocomposites. This
was probably due to the aggregation of CuO nanoparticles in the composites
when the CuO content was high. The results indicate that 10%-CuO/BC
was the optimal composite adsorbent for RR120 under the tested conditions
and thus was main focus of the follow-up characterization and batch
sorption experiments.

2.2 Physiochemical Properties
The SSA
and total pore volume (PV) of BC–BM, CuO–BM, and all
the CuO/BC nanocomposites are summarized in Table 1. The SSA of CuO–BM was the lowest
(19.1 m2 g–1) among all the samples,
which can be attributed to its nonporous nature. The SSA of BC–BM
was very high with a value of 327.0 m2 g–1, which is similar to the values in the previous study of other ball-milled
BC samples.31 The SSA of 1%-CuO/BC (330.0
m2 g–1) was similar to that of BC–BM.
However, further loading of CuO nanoparticles reduced the SSA of the
CuO/BC nanocomposites, which decreased with increasing CuO content
(Table 1). This is
likely due to CuO particles taking up the interstitial pores of the
BC matrix.32 Among all the adsorbents,
10%-CuO/BC possessed the biggest PV of 0.111 cm3 g–1, which might contribute to its distinct performance
in the adsorption of RR120. The details of the porous structure were
exhibited by the N2 adsorption and desorption isotherms
(Figure S1). However, the SSA of 10%-CuO/BC
(296.5 m2 g–1) was not the highest. In
addition, the hysteresis loops of all CuO/BC nanocomposites were similar
and could not explain why 10%-CuO/BC had a much larger PV than the
others. Because CuO nanoparticles were distributed and stabilized
on the BC surface within its pore network, we speculate that the arrangement
of these nanoparticles could affect the pore structure of the composites
or create addition pore spaces, which might contribute to the high
PV and strong RR120 adsorption of 10%-CuO/BC.

The surface morphologies
and microstructures of the as-prepared
BC–BM, CuO–BM and 10%-CuO/BC samples were compared by
scanning electron microscopy (SEM)–energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) analysis. The SEM images showed that the samples were colloidal/nanosized
(Figures 2a,c, and S2a). The EDX spectra clearly demonstrated the
presence of Cu in the CuO–BM and 10%-CuO/BC samples (Figures S2b and 2d) and
no trace of Cu in the BC–BM sample (Figure 2b), suggesting the successful incorporation
of CuO nanoparticles into the nanocomposite. The microstructures of
the BC–BM and 10%-CuO/BC samples were further examined by the
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis (Figure S3). Comparison of the two samples revealed small CuO
nanoparticles attached on the surface of the BC (Figure S3b), suggesting ball milling distributed and stabilized
CuO nanoparticles in the BC matrix. The SEM–EDX and TEM results
indicate that the novel ball-milling method is flexible in preparing
BC-based metal oxide nanocomposites.

The X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) pattern of BC–BM sample
indexed as amorphous carbon with broad and low intensity of diffraction
peak at around 25°, suggesting low crystallinity.30 The XRD spectrum of CuO–BM showed several
peaks at 32.38, 35.54, 38.64, 48.7, 53.47, 58.3, 61.58, 66.08, and
68.13° (Figure 3a), corresponding to (1 1 0), (0 0 2), (2 0 0), (−2 0 2),
(0 2 0), (2 0 2), (−1 1 3), (−3 1 1), and (2 2 0) planes,
respectively.33 Moreover, the sharp and
narrow diffraction peaks indicated its high crystallinity. These peaks
also existed in the XRD pattern for the CuO/BC nanocomposites, suggesting
that formation of nanocomposites did not cause notable changes to
the crystallinity of CuO. The crystalline size of the CuO crystal
plane (0 0 2) in the composites was calculated with the Debye-Scherrer
equation. The results confirmed that the CuO particles in the composites
were nanosized and in the range of 10–14 nm (Table 1).

Figure 3 (a) XRD patterns of CuO–BM,
BC–BM, and CuO/BC nanocomposites;
(b) FT-IR spectra of CuO–BM, BC–BM, and 10%-CuO/BC.

The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrum
of BC–BM
showed several absorption peaks at around 3407, 1580, and 478 cm–1, which can be assigned to the stretching mode of
O–H and N–H groups, aromatic C=C/C=O groups,
and C–O bending deformation, respectively (Figure 3b). In addition, two peaks
observed at 1089 and 1429 cm–1 can be ascribed to
C–O and phenolic O–H, respectively.20,34 Appearance of the peaks at about 871 and 754 cm–1 is primarily characteristic of aromatic C–H bending, whereas
the asymmetrical stretching vibration of C–H bonds from C–H
and C=C groups appeared at 2371 and 2329 cm–1, respectively.35 After CuO modification,
the 10%-CuO/BC sample showed a sharp vibration peak of the Cu(II)–O
bond at 485 cm–1, indicating that the CuO nanoparticles
was introduced into the BC with the aid of oxygen functionalities.36 Furthermore, the peak position of phenolic −OH
was slightly shifted from 1429 to 1378 cm–1on the
composite, suggesting that Cu(II) might produce a chelation effect
with the −OH group.11

The
characteristic peaks of C 1s, N 1s, O 1s, and Cu 2p were detected
in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectrum of 10%-CuO/BC
(Figure 4a), confirming
the presence of Cu species in the synthesized composite. The Cu 2p
spectrum (Figure 4b)
exhibited two shakeup satellite peaks at 943.4 and 941.2 eV, attributed
to Cu 2p3/2 and a symmetric primary peak at 934.1 eV ascribed
to Cu2+ core features, confirming the formation of the
CuO phase in the nanocomposite.37 In the
C 1s spectrum (Figure 4c), the peaks located at 287.8, 285.3, 284.7, and 284.2 eV can be
indexed to C=O/ketone C, C–O, C–H, and C=C/C–C,
respectively.11,38 As for the O 1s spectrum (Figure 4d), the broad peak
was fitted into the two significant peaks centered at 533.0 eV (C–O–C/C–O–H)
and 531.5 eV (−OH/Cu–O).35,39 In comparison
of those of CuO–BM and BC–BM (Figure S4), the binding energies of Cu 2p peaks of 10%-CuO/BC slightly
shifted to lower values, whereas C 1s and O 1s peaks shifted to higher
values, reflecting the interactions between CuO and BC in the nanocomposite.
The XPS results also confirmed the success in synthesis of the CuO/BC
nanocomposites.

2.3 Adsorption
Behaviors
Initial solution
pH showed little effect on the adsorption of RR120 onto 10%-CuO/BC
and there were no obvious differences among the removal rate (∼45%)
at a pH of 4–10 (Figure 5a). Because the point of zero charge of CuO is around 10,40 the surface of the CuO particles in the nanocomposite
was positively charged under most of the tested conditions. As a result,
the CuO particles in the nanocomposite would adsorb anionic RR120
through electrostatic attraction,20 which
would explain why the adsorption was insensitive to initial solution
pH under the tested conditions. The results also indicate the importance
of electrostatic interaction mechanism to the adsorption of RR120
onto CuO/BC nanocomposites.

Figure 5 (a) Effect of the solution pH on RR120 adsorption,
(b) kinetics
of RR120 adsorption (vs time), (c) kinetics of RR120 adsorption (vs
square root of time), and (d) isotherms of RR120 adsorption onto 10%-CuO/BC.
The lines are simulations of various models.

The adsorption kinetic rate of RR120 onto 10%-CuO/BC increased
sharply in the first 0.5 h, then slowed down over time, and reached
the adsorption equilibrium within 3 h (Figure 5b). As shown, the equilibrium adsorption
capacity of the adsorbent approached approximately 56.67 mg g–1 at the initial RR120 concentration of 50 mg L–1. The relatively fast adsorption rate in the initial
stage was probably due to the considerable amount of available vacant
surface sites on the surface of the CuO/BC nanocomposite boosting
electrostatic interaction with RR120 molecules.41 However, the adsorption rate started to decrease subsequently,
owing to the small number of remaining active sites and relatively
strong mass transfer resistance under the low concentration gradient
of the RR120 solutions.42

The adsorption
kinetic data were fitted to commonly used kinetic
models including the pseudo-first-order, pseudo-second-order, and
Elovich models. The descriptions of these models can be found in the Supporting Information (S2) and the best-fit
model parameters are listed in Table 2. The pseudo-second-order model (R2 = 0.952) provided the best fit of the experimental data
comparing with the Elovich model (R2 =
0.947) and the pseudo-first-order model (R2 = 0.767). These results suggest that the adsorption of RR120 dye
onto the nanocomposite was more likely controlled by the chemisorption
process and the boundary layer resistance might not act as the rate-limiting
step.43 The plot of the kinetic adsorption
data versus t0.5 exhibited two segments
of straight lines (Figure 5c), suggesting that the adsorption kinetics of RR120 onto
the nanocomposites could be controlled by the intraparticle diffusion
process.44

The
10%-CuO/BC showed a relatively high adsorption of RR120 at
a wide range of equilibrium concentrations (Figure 5d), reflecting the large adsorption capacity
of the nanocomposite to RR120. The Langmuir and Freundlich models
were applied to simulate the experimental isotherms (S3, Supporting Information) and both models worked
well with R2 values larger than 0.986
(Table 2). The fitting
of the Freundlich model was slightly better than that of the Langmuir
model, probably because of high surface heterogeneity of the nanocomposite.45 Nevertheless, the Langmuir model still simulated
the experimental isotherm very well, suggesting the dominance of the
monolayer adsorption behavior.46 The predicted
Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of the 10%-CuO/BC to RR120 reached
1399 mg g–1, demonstrating the strong adsorption
of the nanocomposite to the anionic dye. The adsorption kinetics and
isotherm results suggest that CuO/BC nanocomposites can be utilized
as an effective adsorbent for anionic contaminants.

3 Conclusions
In summary, highly efficient CuO/BC nanocomposites
were successfully
fabricated from CuO particles and BC via a facile and ecofriendly
ball-milling method. The CuO nanoparticles on the BC surface served
as positively charged adsorption sites of the nanocomposites to effectively
remove an anionic dye (RR120) from aqueous solutions through electrostatic
attraction. As a result, 10%-CuO/BC exhibited fast adsorption kinetics
and extraordinary adsorption capacity to aqueous RR120. It is anticipated
that CuO/BC nanocomposites would hold great promise as an adsorbent
in the removal of anionic organic pollutants from contaminated water.
Compared to traditional methods, the ball-milling technology is more
feasible and has greater potential in practical uses for preparing
BC-based nanocomposites.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
All the chemicals were
of analytical grade and used without further purification. Deionized
(DI) water (18.2 MΩ, Nanopure, Barnstead) was used throughout
the experiments. RR120 (C44H24Cl2N14Na6O20S6) was obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Hickory wood chips (HC) supplied by Cowboy
Charcoal, HC was chosen as the feedstock material of pristine BC.
CuO powder (97% purity, Belgium) and sodium hydroxide (NaOH) (98.5%,
SE) were purchased from Acros Organics. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) (37%,
USA) was supplied by Sigma-Aldrich.

4.2 Preparation
of Adsorbents
The preparation
process of CuO under different ball-milling conditions can be seen
in the Supporting Information (S1).

HC was ground into 1–2 mm pieces for BC production. The feedstock
was heated in a tubular furnace (Olympic 1823HE) under a N2 environment and kept for 8 h at a peak temperature of 600 °C.
After cooling down to room temperature, the product was rinsed several
times using DI water to get rid of the impurities and oven-dried at
80 °C. The sample was labeled as BC.

CuO/BC nanocomposites
were synthesized via the ball-milling method.
In a typical synthesis procedure, 1.8 g of powder of a mixture of
CuO and BC nominal at a weight ratio of 1:99, 1:97, 1:9, 1:4, or 1:1
was put into a planetary ball mill (PQ-N2, Across International, New
Jersey, USA) within agate jars, and then 90 g balls were added into
each jar. The mass ratio of the balls to the powdered mixture was
kept constant at about 50:1 throughout all experiments. Each experiment
was employed for 9 h at a speed of 400 rpm in ambient air and the
rotation direction was altered every 1.5 h. The obtained nanocomposites
were denoted as 1%-CuO/BC, 3%-CuO/BC, 10%-CuO/BC, 20%-CuO/BC, and
50%-CuO/BC, where the percentages are CuO contents. Pristine BC and
CuO were ball milled separately under the same conditions and labeled
as BC–BM and CuO–BM, respectively.

4.3 Characterization Methods
The obtained
BC samples were used directly in most of the characterization analyses.
The micromorphology of the adsorbents was characterized by a field
emission gun scanning electron microscopy (FEG–SEM, Hitachi
S-3400N) equipped with an EDX analyzer. TEM was carried out on a JEM-1011
instrument at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. For the TEM analysis,
the samples were crushed and dispersed in A.R. grade ethanol with
ultrasonic treatment and the resulting suspensions were dried on carbon-film-supported
copper grids. XRD measurement patterns were obtained on a Philips
X’Pert Pro diffractometer by Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
(λ = 0.15418 nm) at a scanning rate of 10°/min from 10
to 80° to identify the crystallographic structure of the samples.
The SSA and PV of the samples were determined according to the Brunauer–Emmet–Teller
theory using N2-adsorption at −196 °C on Micrometrics
ASAP-2020 adsorption apparatus. FT-IR was recorded in the range of
400–4000 cm–1 with the spectral resolution
of 4 cm–1 and on a Nicolet 5700 FT-IR spectrometer
to detect the surface organic functional groups of the samples. The
elemental composition and oxidation state of the samples were determined
by XPS analysis on a PHI 5000 Versa Probe high-performance electron
spectrometer using an Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) achromatic
X-ray source.

4.4 Batch Sorption Experiments
A stock
solution (1 g L–1) of RR120 was freshly prepared
by dissolving 0.5 g of RR120 into 500 mL of DI water. Various RR120
concentrations required in all batch experiments were made by diluting
the stock solution.

Batch sorption experiments were carried
out to compare the adsorption ability of the samples obtained under
various milling conditions at different CuO/BC ratios. About 20 mg
of sorbent (dosage of 0.40 g L–1) was added into
a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Korea)
containing 50 mL of 50 mg L–1 RR120 solutions. After
shaking for 24 h, the mixtures were immediately withdrawn to determine
the removal rates. The sample with the highest RR120 removal rate
(10%-CuO/BC) was selected to further investigate the adsorption behaviors
of RR120 on CuO/BC nanocomposites.

The effect of initial pH
on RR120 removal was investigated using
10%-CuO/BC composite pH = 2–10 (i.e., 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
9, and 10) under the same conditions (dosage, concentration, and contact
time). Negligible volumes of 0.01 M HCl or NaOH solutions were used
to adjust the solutions’ pH to desired values monitored by
a pH meter (Fisher Scientific, AB 15 digital pH meter).

To measure
the adsorption kinetics, 0.02 g of 10%-CuO/BC was added
into 50 mL of 50 mg L–1 RR120 solutions shaking
for different time intervals (i.e., 0.08, 0.17, 0.33, 0.5, 1, 2, 3,
5, 6, 7, and 8 h). The isotherms were obtained by adding 0.02 g of
the adsorbent with 50 mL RR120 of varying initial concentrations ranging
from 20 to 750 mg L–1 (i.e., 20, 50, 100, 200, 300,
500, 600, and 750 mg L–1) and shaken for 24 h.

In all experiments, the mixtures were shaken at a constant rate
(240 rpm) using a mechanical shaker at room temperature (25 °C).
The withdrawn samples were filtered by 0.22 μm pore size nylon
membrane filters (MCE Syringe Filter, China). The aqueous RR120 concentrations
were analyzed by a UV–vis spectrophotometer (EVO 60, Thermo
Fisher Scientific International, USA) at a wavelength of 515 nm. All
experiments were performed in duplicate and the average values are
reported.
