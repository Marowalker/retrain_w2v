In this study, the degree of the
π-orbital overlap (DPO)
model proposed earlier for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH)
was employed to develop quantitative structure–property relationships
(QSPRs) for band gaps, ionization potentials, and electron affinities
of thienoacenes. DPO is based on two-dimensional topological draw
of aromatic molecules. The B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of density functional
theory (DFT) was used to provide chemical data for developing QSPRs.
We found that the DPO model is able to capture the correct physics
of electronic properties of aromatic molecules so that with only six
nonzero topological parameters (four for PAH and additional two for
thienoacenes), the DPO model yields the linear dependence of electronic
properties of both the PAH and thienoacenes classes by a single set
of QSPRs with the accuracy to within 0.1 eV of the DFT results. The
results suggest that within the DPO framework, all aromatic molecules
can share the same set of QSPRs.

1 Introduction
Along with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), thiophene-based
materials play an important role in organic-semiconductor classes;
especially, in fabricating electronic devices commercially. Although
not possessing outstanding electronic properties such as PAHs, thiophene-based
structures own a number of physical characters making them easier
to be synthesized under room conditions and be stretched in thin-film
morphology than the PAHs as well as are more soluble and more stable
in oxidized species. They are used in production of organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs), organic field-effect transistors, organic thin-film
transistors, and organic photovoltaics.1−16

Thienoacene is a class of thiophene-based materials where
one or
more benzene rings of the PAH structure are replaced by thiophene
rings.17 This class has a wide range of
synthetic patterns. Experimentalists have been trying to discover
the newest thienoacene structures that could possess characters for
enhancing the electronic quality of devices; particularly, the band
gap, mobility, and stability in harsh conditions.10,12,14,15,17,18 Computational chemistry,
particularly the use of density functional theory (DFT), would aid
in the design stage of the experimentation. However, even with the
current computing power, it still takes time and resources to screen
a large molecular space. Quantitative structure property relationship
(QSPR) modeling that can predict electronic properties of such materials
with a reasonable degree of accuracy would be of great interest in
aiding this material research.

The QSPR method is well established
for biological applications
and is making progress in material design such as for nanomaterials,
biomaterials, polymers, and ionic liquids.19 For instance, the QSPR method in combination with DFT computations
has proved to be a cost effective approach for designing materials
as proposed by Sukumar et al.20 New methodologies
are being developed such as using the deep neural network to improve
limitations of QSPR modeling reported by Winkler and Le.21 or in combination with the artificial network
model and support vector machine for predicting electroluminescence
of a small set of OLED structures.22 Regarding
OLED applications, the QSPR approach was used to study the glass transition
temperature.23,24 QSPR models were also developed
for predictions of critical electronic and thermomechanical properties
of crystalline materials25,26 or energetic materials
such as nitro-organic compounds.27 Also,
screening metal organic framework materials for CO2 capture
was studied by applying the QSPR approach with advanced machine learning
algorithms.28 However, there have not been
many studies regarding QSPR applications for predictions of electronic
properties of organic semiconductor materials. Particularly, for thienoacene,
there has not been any QSPR study for its electronic properties reported
till today. In our recent study,29 we proposed
a new model called “degree of π-orbital overlap”
(DPO) based on a quantum mechanical particle in two-dimensional (2D)
box to develop QSPR for electronic properties of PAHs. With only four
topological parameters, the DPO model was able to predict electronic
properties of PAHs in the particular band gap, ionization potential
(IP), and electron affinity (EA) to within 0.1 eV accuracy on average
compared to the explicitly calculated data.

In this study, we
extend the DPO model to the thienoacene molecular
class and further examined the accuracy of the DPO model.

2 Computational Details
2.1 Data Sets
In this
study, the thienoacene
class is divided into two separate subclasses: 1T-subclass and 2T-subclass
groups. 1T-subclass molecules consist of one thiophene ring with benzenes,
and the 2T-subclass is those of two thiophene rings. The structures
having 4 to 6 rings of two subclasses constitute the development set
of total 81 molecules for building the QSPRs, and those having 7–8
rings of the subclasses make up the test set of total 82 molecules
for assessing the accuracy of the QSPRs.

2.2 Computational
Methods
Geometries
of all molecules in two data sets are fully optimized, and their electronic
properties are calculated by the DFT B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level of theory.
This level of theory is known to predict frontier orbital energies
accurately.3,4,30,31

The IP is estimated by the negative value of
the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy, and similarly,
the EA is estimated by the negative value of the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) according to Koopman’s theory. The
HOMO–LUMO gap is used to estimate the band gap.32

2.3 Quantum Mechanical-Based
DPO Model
It is well known in physical chemistry that the
HOMO–LUMO
gap of a conjugated polyethylene such as butadiene can be modeled
by a particle in a one-dimensional box model with an effective box
length. With a similar argument, our recent study29 suggested that the DPO model based on a simplified quantum
mechanical particle in a 2D box framework for developing QSPRs for
electronic properties of PAHs. In the DPO model, a given PAH can be
constructed by stacking the benzene ring (as building blocks) in four
different ways, and thus the entire PAH molecular space can be represented
by four topological parameters.29 For thienoacenes,
one or more benzene rings are on the rim of a PAH that are replaced
by thiophene rings. For this reason, it is reasonable to suggest that
the DPO model for thienoacenes can be constructed on top of that for
PAHs. In particular, the construct of the 1T-subclass of thienoacenes
where a benzene ring is replaced by a thiophene ring is shown in Figure 1. The cartoons on
the right side of Figure 1 illustrates how π electrons in thienoacene molecules
can be modeled as the particle in a 2D box with more complicated shapes.

Figure 1 Building
blocks for constructing a given thienoacene molecule of
the 1T-subclass. (a–d) are simplified models showing how these
building blocks are related to the DPO a–d parameters. Fused bonds are highlighted in bold.

To see the direct link between
the DPO model with the 2D box, let
us assume benzene as a square 2D box of length d.
A linear acene of l benzene rings can be modeled
by stacking l square boxes along the x-axis similar
to Figure 1a above.
The HOMO orbital energy of the linear acene within the quantum mechanical
2D box model is given by 1  where (nx,ny) are the quantum
numbers of the HOMO orbital; h is the Planck constant, me is the mass of the electron. From our previous
study, we have shown that the QSRP for the IP of the PAH class has
the form 2  where α and
β are fitting constants
to DFT calculated values. Comparing between 1 and 2, the DPO value for a given linear acene
is related to those of the 2D box by 3  

Below, we
show how XDPO is determined
empirically.

2.3.1 Rule for Determining DPO Value of a Thienoacene
Structure
In order to apply the DPO model for predicting
electronic properties, namely, the band gap, IP, and EA of a given
thienoacene molecule, one must first determine its DPO value according
to the following procedure.

Step 1: Determine the reference
segment by applying the following rules in the sequential order till
a distinct reference segment is found.a. The segment with the largest number
of fused rings (or fused bonds) is the reference segment.

b. If all segments in the
molecule have
the same size, the segment with the largest number of parallel-fused
bonds orthogonal to its direction is the reference segment. Furthermore,
the segment consisting of only benzenes is preferred over that having
thiophene rings.

c. If
rules (a) and (b) do not yield a
unique segment, then the segment with the least number of overlayers
is the reference segment.



For example,
for the two thienoacenes shown in Figure 2, segment 1 of structure I
has the largest number of fused rings; therefore, it is the reference
segment according to rule (a). In structure II, both segments 3 and
4 have the same number of fused rings; however, segment 3 contains
only benzenes and thus is preferred to be the reference segment.

Figure 2 Segment
1 of structure I and segment 3 of structure II are the
reference segments. Fused bonds are highlighted in bold.

In Figure 3, structure
III has three segments with the same size. According to rule (a),
segments 1 and 2 are preferred but have the same size. Using rule
(b), segment 1 of structure III is selected to be the reference segment
because it has a larger number of parallel-fused bonds orthogonal
to the reference direction. In structure IV, in Figure 3, both rules (a) and (b) do not yield a unique
segment. In this case, rule (c) helps to select segment 5 to be the
reference segment.

Figure 3 Segment 1 of structure III and segment 5 of IV are chosen
to be
the reference segments.

In the previous study, we described how to calculate the
DPO value
for any PAH molecule. Here, we review how it is done; therefore, the
instruction for assigning the DPO value for any thienoacene is easier
to follow. Each of the fused bonds in a PAH or thienoacene is assigned
a value, a topological parameter for its contribution to the total
DPO value. Below is how we assign a topological value to each fused
bond.

Step 2: Assigning a DPO topological value for each fused
bond.a. For the reference segment that contains
only benzene rings, starting from the leftmost, each fused bond has
a value successively of 1, 1 – a, 1 –
2a, 1 – 3a, and so on where a is the topological parameter for the PAH class. If there
is a thiophene ring attached on the reference segment, then the total
DPO for this segment is subtracted by the parameter a*, shown in Figure 4.

b. For the other segments,
there are three
types:

Type 1: For a segment that is
paralleled to the reference
one, similar assignments of the base values, that is, 1, (1 – a) and (1 – 2a) are used. However,
each fused bond is then adjusted by a scaling factor of dk, where k is the order
of the layer above or below the segment including the first parameter
assigned to fused bonds, that is, and d is also a
parameter for the PAH class. If a benzene ring is replaced by a thiophene
ring in this segment, the scaling parameter d* is
used instead. Figure 5 shows how parameter d or d* are
used.

Type 2: For a segment with its
fused bonds that form
a 60° angle with the reference one, these fused bonds are assigned
with the topological value b if the segment has all
benzene rings. For each subsequent parallel-fused bond, its value
is scaled by a factor d or d* if
a thiophene is at the end of the segment as shown in the top row of Figure 6. However, when a
thiophene ring is attached on the reference segment at an angle or
a small benzene ring segment is fused on the other side of thiophene,
these fused bonds are assigned to topological parameter b* as shown in the bottom-row structures in Figure 6.

Type 3: For
segment with its fused bonds form a 120°
angle with those of the reference segment, and these fused bonds are
assigned by topological parameter c. Similar to type
2, for each subsequent parallel-fused bond, its value is scaled by
factor d or d* if a thiophene is
attached at the end of the segment as shown in Figure 7. If a thiophene ring is attached to the
benzene side on the segment as shown on the last structures of Figure 7, the fused bond
is assigned to the topological parameter c* instead.



Figure 4 DPO values of the reference segments containing only benzene
rings
and a thiophene ring.

Figure 5 Illustration of how topological parameters d and d* are assigned fused bonds.

Figure 6 Illustration of how topological parameters b and b* are assigned fused bonds.

Figure 7 Illustration of how topological parameters c and c* are assigned fused bonds.

For the PAH class, the topological parameters of a, b, c, and d determined
from our previous study are 0.05, −1/4, +1/3, and +1/3, respectively.
With the similar procedure of using a small set of molecules that
allows the independent optimization of each parameter, for the thienoacene
class, the topological parameters a*, b*, c*, and d* are 0.50, 0.0, 0.0,
and 0.15, respectively. Consequently, we have six nonzero topological
parameters in order to determine the DPO value for any PAH or thienoacene
molecule.

Step 3: The total DPO value for a given molecule is
the sum of
all topological values assigned to all fused bonds.

Examples
for assigning the DPO value for each fused bond and their
total values are given below for six different thienoacene molecules.
The total DPO values of compounds A = 2.28, B = 2.48, C = 1.78, D =
2.42, E = 1.47, and F = 2.64 are
shown in Figure 8.

3 Results and Discussions
3.1 DPO-Based QSPR
Linear correlations
between DPO values and the three electronic properties of 1-T thienoacene
and 2-T thienoacene classes are shown in Figures 9A–C and 10A–C,
respectively.

HOMO–LUMO
gaps, (B) IPs, and (C) electron affinities of thienoacenes from the
development set of the 1T-subclass.

Figure 10 Plots of linear correlations between DPO values and (A) HOMO–LUMO
gaps, (B) IPs, and (C) electron affinities of thienoacenes from the
development set of the 2T-subclass.

These figures show excellent linear correlations between
DPOs and
the electronic properties of thienoacenes with the corresponding correlation
coefficients (R2) all greater than 0.9.
Compared to PAHs results, almost all R2 values of the 1T-subclass and 2T-subclass are in a similar level
of correlations as those of PAHs in our previous study. Linear equations
for these correlations of the band gap, IP, and EA properties as functions
of the DPO values are summarized in Table 1 along with those for PAH from the previous
study.

EA of PAHs and Thienoacenes (all are in eV)

IP	y = −0.35x + 6.14	y = −0.30x + 5.99	y = −0.30x + 6.04	
EA	y = +0.41x + 1.22	y = +0.33x + 1.31	y = +0.35x + 1.36	
It is interesting
to note that the slopes and intercepts of all
linear equations for both thienoacenes and PAHs are very similar in
magnitude. As shown in Figure 11, they are within the uncertainty of the linear fit.
This indicates that the DPO model is able to capture the correct physics
of the aromatic systems and thus all aromatic systems can share the
same QSPRs. For this reason, we used the QSPRs of PAH for analyzing
the accuracy of the DPO model for both the thienoacenes and PAH classes.

(B) IPs, and (C) electron affinities.

3.2 Accuracy of DPO-Based QSPRs
To assess
the accuracy and predictability of DPO-based QSPRs for the electronic
properties of these thienoacene subclasses, electronic properties
of all molecules in the test set were plotted against those predicted
by QSPRs, as shown in Figure 12A–C. Note QSPRs of PAH are used for all assessments
below.

Figure 12 Plots of the QSPR predicted vs DFT explicitly calculated electronic
properties for thienoacenes in the test set. (A) HOMO–LUMO
gaps, (B) IPs, and (C) electron affinities.

Root-mean-square differences (RMSDs) between QSPR-predicted
and
DFT explicitly calculated properties for thienoacenes in the test
set are all less than 0.1 eV. This is even within the accuracy of
the DFT level of theory. These results are consistent with our previous
results for PAH, though here we used the PAH QSPRs to further illustrate
that all aromatic molecules can share same QSPRs. To further illustrate
this point, Figure 13 shows the QSPR-predicted and DFT explicitly calculated properties
for all PAHs (34 molecules) and thienoacenes (82 molecules) in both
test sets using the same QSPR equations from PAH. Again RMSDs for
all properties are less than 0.1 eV. These results suggest that the
DPO model is able to capture the correct physics of electronic properties
of aromatic molecules, and thus their properties can be modeled by
one set of QSPRs. Note that the current DPO model has only six topological
parameters for both PAH and thienoacenes.

Figure 13 Plots of QSPR-predicted
vs DFT explicitly calculated electronic
properties of PAHs and thienoacenes: (A) HOMO–LUMO gaps, (B)
IPs, and (C) electron affinities.

To further examine the range of applicability of the model, Figure 14 shows QSPR predicted
versus DFT explicitly calculated electronic properties for a number
of thienoacenes with three and four thiophene rings using the PAH
QSPRs. Note these thienoacenes are not part of the QSPR development
set nor the test set. The results suggest that our DPO-based QSPR
model can be applied to all thienoacenes that have planar structures
with similar accuracy. For nonplanar structures, the errors are larger
due to the disruption in the resonance structure of the molecule.
The issue with nonplanarity in the DPO-based QSPR model has been addressed
in detail in our previous study.

calculated properties
of thienoacene molecules containing three to four thiophene rings:
(A) HOMO–LUMO gaps, (B) IPs, and (C) EAs. The black crosses
are for nonplanar molecules and red dots are for planar ones. The
RMSD values for planar molecules are in parentheses.

3.3 How To Use DPO-Based QSPRs
For any
given PAH or thienoacene, the following procedure should be used:
(a) identify all fused bonds and then select the reference segment;
(b) assign a DPO topological parameter to each fused bond according
to the rule described above; and (c) sum all of these values to give
the total DPO value of the structure. Subsequently, use the QSPRs
for PAH in Table 1 with
the calculated DPO value to predict the band gap, IP, and EA of the
molecule.

4 Conclusions
In this
study, we applied the DPO model proposed earlier to develop
QSPR for band gaps, IPs, and electron affinities of thienoacenes.
Electronic properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level
of theory and are used to develop the QSPRs as well as to assess its
accuracy for the thienoacene class. We found that QSPRs for thienoacene
and those for PAH found in our previous study are almost the same
within the uncertainty of the calculations. This indicates that the
DPO model is able to capture the correct physics of electronic properties
of aromatic molecules so that with only six nonzero topological parameters,
the DPO model can yield a single set of linear dependence of electronic
properties for both the PAH and thienoacenes classes to within the
accuracy of 0.1 eV of the DFT results.

These results suggest
the possibility for applying the DPO model
to other conjugated classes of molecules in addition to other aromatic
classes. It will be the subject of our future studies.
