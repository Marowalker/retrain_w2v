A microporous
pH- and light-responsive membrane that enables remote
control over its interfacial properties has been fabricated. pH-Responsiveness
was imparted to a porous polypropylene film via grafting of poly(methacrylic
acid) brushes from the substrate using argon-plasma-induced free-radical
graft polymerization. Morphological changes as a function of grafting
level were analyzed using atomic force microscopy. Conversion into
a light-responsive membrane was performed via postpolymerization modification
to covalently attach photochromic spiropyran moieties to the grafted
polymer brushes. Reversible switches in wettability and permeability
were determined upon changing from acidic to basic pH or upon alternating
UV- and visible-light irradiation. Additionally, light-responsive
membranes show a switch in color upon UV exposure.

Introduction
Smart membranes that
are sensitive to their environment have received
tremendous attention in recent years as they enable rapid, remote-controlled
switching of their interfacial properties.1−7 They are materials designed with properties such as swelling behavior,
permeability, or interactions with ions and biomolecules that can
be changed reversibly in a controlled way by external stimulation.
Switching originates from responsiveness to a certain trigger such
as changes in pH,8 temperature,9 concentration of metal ions,10 or exposure to light.11

Polypropylene (PP) membranes are low-cost materials that show advanced
bulk properties in terms of their mechanical strength, dimensional
stability, and chemical inertness,12 which
brings with them, however, a degree of hydrophobicity, low reactivity,
and poor biocompatibility.
Modification of such commercial substrates to improve their surface
properties is, therefore, very attractive.13 Conventional simple methods include coating and grafting processes.
The readily implemented dip- or spin-coating techniques have the disadvantages
of pore blockage and weak adhesion forces to the parent polymer.14 Grafting of polymer brushes covalently either
via “grafting-to” or via “grafting-from”
is a very powerful, efficient, and simple method to covalently attach
new functionalities allowing a fast response to an environmental stimulus
due to flexible mobile chain ends, while retaining the desirable bulk
properties of the parent material.
Different techniques have been established as a pretreatment to activate
polymeric membranes for graft polymerization, namely, via plasma,15 ozone,16 UV light,17 or γ-irradiation.18 Plasma activation is a fast, dry, and environmentally friendly approach,
which has been heavily exploited in the industry for the cleaning
of surfaces and recently also for surface activation to form homogenous
coatings.19,20

The adjustment of pH conditions is
a simple and low-energy method,21 which
has resulted in its becoming the most
commonly used stimulus in membrane science. Membranes that are sensitive
toward pH have been fabricated using a variety of processes including
the formation of polymer networks, chemical modification of the bulk
material, or via grafting of polymer brushes on their surfaces. Typical
pH-responsive polymers are weak polyelectrolytes, that is, polymerized
weak acids such as poly(acrylic acid)21 and poly(methacrylic acid) (PMAA)22 or
bases such as poly(N,N-dimethylaminoethylmethacrylate)23 or poly(4-vinylpyridine).24 They undergo conformational transitions depending on the
pH conditions. The response of polyacids to pH occurs via deprotonation
above their particular pKa values, which
induces a swelling of the charged polymer and—when grafted
to a porous membrane—a decrease in the pore size.
Alternatively, protonation below their pKa values induces a collapse of the noncharged polymer and an increase
in pore size.25 pH-Responsive membranes
have been used for chemical separation processes such as for oil/water
mixtures,26 proteins,27 and metal ions28 as well as
in biotechnological applications such as biosensors,4 drug-delivery systems,29 or
nonfouling surfaces.30

However, research
regarding light-responsive polymeric membranes
has been exceedingly rare.2 As a stimulus,
light is very attractive because it can be applied as an external
trigger,31 allowing remote-controlled actuation
of closed systems without risk of chemical contamination. Photons
can be easily focused and delivered over long distances to a well-defined
surface area. Photochromic materials undergo light-induced conformational
changes, usually inducing a change in dipole moment. The best investigated
photochromic moieties used as reversible organic switches in polymeric
materials are azobenzenes32 and spiropyrans
(SPs).33,34 SP performs a heterolytic ring cleavage
under UV-light irradiation to form the planar zwitterionic merocyanine
(MC) isomer, which produces—when attached to a surface—a
dramatic change in surface free energy, resulting in enhanced wettability.
The MCs close back to the nonpolar SP form upon exposure to visible
light or thermally induced relaxation. Light-responsive materials
have found applications in photonic devices and35 photosensitive lenses36 and
have been used to control permeability,11,37 protein adhesion,38 and drug delivery.39−41

There
are in general two strategies to graft light-responsive polymer
brushes onto porous polymeric membranes. One approach is via a random
graft-copolymerization of photochromic monomers, and another approach
is using postpolymerization modification (PPM) of previously grafted
polymer brushes.42 PPM benefits from its
simplicity, as commercially available monomers can be used without
the need to synthesize photochromic monomers or to optimize polymerization
conditions for such highly functional monomers.43−45

In this
article, we demonstrate a facile approach to grafting functional
polymer brushes on microporous polymeric substrates. PMAA polymer
brushes were grafted from a 30 μm-thick PP membrane to endow
it with pH-responsiveness. Further, an established PPM45 of the grafted polymer brushes with photochromic
SPs was used to create light-responsive polymer brushes (PMA–SP).
Changes in wettability and in permeability upon change in pH and visible-
and UV-light irradiation were analyzed using static water contact
angle (CA) and water-flux measurements.

This study shows the
powerful potential for facile modification
methods such as plasma-induced growth of polymer brushes on inert
polymer membranes. Using highly efficient PPM methods, a broad range
of properties such as nonbiofouling, catalytic property, or bioactivity
can be applied by conjugating, for example, enzymes or antibodies.

Results
and Discussion
Grafting of pH-Responsive PMAA Polymer Brushes
on Polymeric
Substrates
In this work, we used an argon plasma source to
asymmetrically activate a microporous PP membrane and, for comparison,
a flat PP film. The asymmetric activation leads to a gradient of grafted
structures through the porous membrane. Figure 1a illustrates the activation step and the
subsequent grafting of pH-responsive PMAA polymer brushes from the
polymeric substrates via free-radical polymerization (FRP). In Figure 1b, the grafting level
(GL)—that is, the mass uptake of PP membrane samples after
the grafting of PMAA polymer brushes—is shown as a function
of
the argon-plasma activation time. The GL achieved under the same reaction
conditions was found to increase with increasing activation time,
as a consequence of an increasing radical concentration. It reached
a maximum after 4 min and decreased again with longer activation time.
This indicates that a very high radical density enhances side reactions
in the grafting process, such as the recombination of surface-bound
or chain-end radicals in the immediate vicinity, leading to the termination
of the polymerization process. Similar behavior was observed by Shi
et al.22 when grafting PMAA polymer brushes
on polyethersulfone (PES) substrates.

Figure 1 (a) Strategy
for grafting of PMAA polymer brushes after one-side
argon plasma activation from PP substrates and (b) mass uptake of
PP membranes after grafting of PMAA polymer brushes as a function
of activation time.

Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) height images of a nongrafted membrane
sample and samples grafted under identical conditions with 30 s, 1
min, and 2 min activation times are shown in Figure 2. With the applied FRP technique, polymer
grafting led to a drastic change in morphology. With increasing GL,
the fibers of the pristine microporous PP membrane changed from a
very delicate microporous network to an increasingly closed system
(see also Figure S3). Furthermore, samples
of higher GL showed optical inhomogeneity and became brittle and opaque.
The static water CAs of grafted PMAA on both PP membrane and flat-pressed
PP film samples have been determined with respect to activation time
with argon plasma (Figure S1). After grafting with hydrophilic PMAA,
the CA was drastically reduced from 117° to 36° for membrane
samples and from 103° to 57° for films, independent of their
activation time with argon plasma. The difference in CA between the
membrane and film samples was caused by their different morphologies,
the higher surface roughness of the membrane samples leading to Cassie–Baxter
wetting.

(d) 2 min activation time with argon plasma.

Switching Properties of pH-Responsive PMAA Polymer Brushes
The response of PMAA polymer brushes in terms of wettability at
different pH values was determined qualitatively by static water CA
measurements. Figure 3a shows that the CA could be reversibly switched between 59°
and <10° for PP membranes and between 68° and 21°
for PP films, upon alternating acidic and basic conditions. These
changes in wettability are caused by a change in the surface free
energy due to reversible protonation from the more hydrophobic state
(PMAA) under acidic conditions and deprotonation of the carboxylic
acids to the very hydrophilic polyelectrolyte state (PMA–) under basic conditions. Under neutral conditions, the CA in both
cases took up a position in between both states (36° for membranes
and 58° for film samples), which could be interpreted as a configuration
where the brushes are partly deprotonated to a partially deprotonated
polyelectrolyte P(MAA/MA–) (Figure 3b). However, to calculate the switch in the
surface free energy of such hydrophilic surfaces, dynamic CA measurements
need to be carried out, taking potential reorientations of the flexible
surface-bound chains into account.46 The
pH-responsiveness in terms of permeability of PMAA-modified PP membranes
has been determined by measuring the flux under neutral, acidic, and
basic conditions and as a function of the GL caused by different activation
times with argon plasma (Table 1, and Figure 4).

between (b) the fully protonated hydrophobic state (PMAA) under acidic
conditions, a partially deprotonated polyelectrolyte state (P(MAA/MA–)) under neutral pH, and the fully deprotonated polyelectrolyte
configuration (PMA–) under basic conditions. The
error in the values is estimated to be below 2°.

Figure 4 Reversible switching of the flux through PMMA-brush-modified
PP
membranes under different pH conditions with respect to the GL, which
in turn is a function of the activation time with argon plasma. The
most intense switching is observed at a lowest GL. The error in the
values is estimated to be below 3 L m–2 h–1.

The water flux of a PMAA-grafted PP membrane
(d = 12 mm) with a 30 s plasma activation (256 L
m–2 h–1) was lower than that of
the pristine PP membrane
(306 L m–2 h–1), indicating a
reduced pore size caused by the grafting of PMAA brushes. Under acidic
conditions, the flux is enhanced by roughly 30% compared with the
neutral pH, to 331 L m–2 h–1,
that is, to a value higher than that of the pristine membrane. This
effect is interpreted as deswelling of the fully protonated PMAA brushes,
combined with the higher wettability of PMAA compared with PP (CAPP = 117° vs CAPMAA = 36°). Under basic
conditions, the flux was strongly reduced by 63% compared with that
in pH 7, to −94 L m–2 h–1, caused by the full deprotonation of the carboxylic acid moieties,
causing a strong swelling of the polymer brushes (Figure 4). This switching under alternating
pH conditions was reversible for more than 10 cycles. With increasing
GL, the water flux under neutral conditions reduced significantly,
that is, by more than two-thirds, from 256 L m–2 h–1 for a 30 s activation time to 81 L m–2 h–1 for 5 min activation time. Similar trends
in the flux upon swelling and deswelling of the polymer brushes under
basic and acidic conditions were observed for all GLs. The relative
flux at low pH was roughly 10–20% higher than that under aqueous
conditions, independent of the GL. This implies a similar deswelling
of the polymer brushes, irrespective of their GL. This could be a
consequence of a number of side reactions, leading to a higher polydispersity
and a potential crosslinking of grafted polymer chains according to
higher radical densities on the surface. By contrast, the relative
flux under basic conditions is more dependent on the GL compared with
that under aqueous conditions. It reduced from 63% for 30 s to 32%
for 5 min activation time because the membrane pores became increasingly
blocked. Furthermore, at longer exposure times, side reactions such
as termination through recombination of surface-bound radicals and
crosslinking could lead to an increasing inflexibility and lower swelling
rates of the grafted networks. In summary, the highest magnitude of
flux switching due to pH was determined at the lowest GL (252% for
30 s activation) and the lowest magnitude was determined at the highest
GL (81% for 5 min activation).

Postpolymerization of PMAA Polymer Brushes To Create Light-Responsive
Substrates
To impart light responsiveness to the PP substrates,
a previously established two-step PPM was applied to covalently attach
photochromic SP moieties via an amine linker to the activated PMAA
polymer brushes (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Strategy for the synthesis of light-responsive polymer brushes
via PPM of PMAA polymer structures on PP substrates.

In this process, the carboxylic acid groups of
the PMAA brushes
are first converted in quantitative yields into fluorinated anhydrides
[poly(trifluoroacetic methacrylate
anhydride) (PTFAMA)].45 The activated carboxylic
groups allow covalent attachment of the SP amines via the formation
of an amide to modify the polymer brushes with up to 40% yield. Detailed
characterization of the grafted PMAA polymer brushes and their PPM
on both PP membranes and films using attenuated total reflectance
infrared (ATR-IR) microscopy and CA measurements are given in Figure S2 and Tables S1 and S2.

Switching Properties of
Light-Responsive Polymeric Substrates
After the PPM, the
PP membrane samples appeared light pink and
showed a color switch to deep purple when exposed to UV light, inducing
the SP–MC transition (Figure 6a). The color change
was also detected in UV/vis transmission spectrometry as an absorbance
band at 570 nm (Figure 6b). Upon alternating exposure to visible and UV light, the static
water CA of the SP-modified surfaces could be reversibly switched
between 88° (PMMA–SP) and 66° (PMMA–MC) on
PP films and between 103° and 93° on PP membranes (Figure 7a). The surface free
energy increases because of the increased dipole moment of the MC
form, causing a higher wettability and a lower CA. The switches in
CA on both surfaces are within the range reported for SP-modified
surfaces.44,45 Again, the difference in CA between the
membrane and film samples is presumably an effect of their differing
morphologies.

switches

structures of ring-closed SP to the zwitterionic open form of MC.
In areas covered by different masks, light pink PMA–SP brushes
do not switch in color, whereas in areas exposed to UV light, the
membrane appears deep purple because of PMA–MC brushes. (b)

Figure 7 Representative reversible switching in (a) static water
CA on a
PMA–SP-brush-modified PP membrane and film,
measured with 3 μL water droplets and in (b) water flux through
a pristine and an SP-modified PP membrane under a pressure of 750
mbar upon alternating exposure to visible and UV light. The error
in the values is estimated to be below 2° for CA and below 3
L m–2 h–1 for flux measurements.

In Figure 7b and Table 1, the switching of
permeability upon light exposure of photochromic PP membranes is demonstrated
using flux measurements under alternating UV- and visible-light irradiation.
The flux of a photochromic membrane with the lowest GL increased by
40% from 289 to 405 L m–2 h–1 after
an exposure of 30 s with UV light and relaxed back within 30 min under
ambient visible light. A similar, but much weaker, UV-light-induced
permeability increase has been described by Chung et al.11 for grafted SP-containing methacrylates on poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
(PTFE),
involving a reversible switch of 15%.

With increasing GL, the
average flux was reduced under both visible-
and UV-light irradiation, corresponding to the reduced pore sizes.
In contrast to the pH-dependent switch in flux, the permeability of
UV-sensitive membranes appears not to be dominated by the swelling
behavior of the brushes but by the wettability switch induced by the
SP–MC transition. The usually short activation time of only
30 s with UV light causes an immediate difference in wetting but not
in swelling. The swelling of the zwitterionic brushes would need more
time, as the chains have to decoil, a process associated with configurational
changes. The pristine and SP-modified PP membranes are very hydrophobic,
whereas the zwitterionic MC isomers formed under UV-light irradiation
favor the passage of water through the membrane. This hypothesis is
supported by the rather minor changes in the relative switch in permeability
for light-responsive membranes, which reduced only from 40 to 33%
with increasing GL, whereas the change for pH-responsive membranes
was from 252 to 81%.

Methods
Materials
Commercial
30 μm-thick microporous
PP membranes (TreoPore-PDA 30, Treofan Germany GmbH & Co. KG,
Raunheim, Germany) with a porosity of >60% and hot-pressed, flat
120
μm-thick PP films (Kolma 59464, Kolma AG, Wabern, Switzerland)
were used as substrates and were rinsed with ethanol before use. Methacrylic
acid (Sigma-Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland) was purified by distillation.
Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Buchs, Switzerland),
VWR (Zurich, Switzerland), or Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland) and were
used as received. Water for rinsing or as a solvent was of Millipore
quality (Quantum Ex/Q-Gard 2, Merck Millipore, Zug, Switzerland).
The SP amine was prepared as previously reported.45

Sample Preparation
PP substrates
were activated with
low-pressure argon plasma (Femto, Diener Electronics, Jettingen, Germany)
operated at 40 kHz/30 W for between 30 s and 5 min, similarly to previously
described procedures.44,45 Plasma-treated samples were allowed
to stand in air for 10 min before grafting and placed in a monomer
solution of methacrylic acid (5 vol %) in 6 mL of 0.1 M HCl, degassed
with nitrogen, and heated for 1 h at 70 °C. For the postpolymerization,
PMAA brush samples were reacted in a solution of 196 μL of triethylamine
(1.4 mmol) and 244 μL of perfluorophenyl trifluoroacetate (1.4
mmol) in 6 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) for 24 h at room temperature
(RT) and subsequently in a solution of 85 mg of SP amine (0.2 mmol)
in 6 mL of THF for 24 h at RT.

Atomic Force Microscopy
AFM scans in height mode were
acquired via Tapping Mode in air on a Dimension Icon instrument (Bruker,
Karlsruhe, Germany) using proprietary silicon nitride (Si3N4) cantilevers with a tip radius of 7 nm, a spring constant
of 26 N m–1, and a resonance frequency of 300 kHz.
Images were processed with second-order flattening procedures (Nanoscope
software, Veeco, Germany).

Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared Spectroscopy
Measurements were recorded using a Hyperion 3000 IR microscope
(Bruker,
Fällanden, Switzerland) equipped with an ATR objective with
a circular contact area of 100 μm diameter.

Water Contact
Angle Determination
A DataPhysics OCA
25 contact angle measuring system (DataPhysics GmbH, Filderstadt,
Germany) was used for the determination of static CAs of 3 μL
water droplets.

Flux Measurements
Membrane samples
were placed between
two PE frits (20 μm, Carl Roth GmbH+ Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany)
in a 6 mL SPE column (PP, Carl Roth GmbH+ Co. KG, Karlsruhe, Germany).
The column end was connected to a vacuum pump (SC920, KNF Lab, KNF
Neuberger GmbH, Freiburg, Germany) to produce a minor under-pressure
of 750 mbar. Samples were placed in the relevant aqueous solutions
for 1 h before measurements. For pH-responsive measurements, the flux
was determined by the time taken for 5 mL of water, HCl (0.1 M), or
NaOH (0.1 M) to pass through the membrane. The method used generally
leads to higher relative errors when determining high flow rates.
For light-responsive measurements, samples were exposed for 30 s to
UV light before use.

UV/Vis Spectroscopy
A UV/vis/near-infrared
spectrometer
(Lambda19, PerkinElmer, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland), equipped with
a deuterium lamp and a halogen light source, was used for acquiring
the UV/vis transmission spectra in the range of 200 to 800 nm.

Conclusions
A new method for the fabrication of responsive polymeric membranes
has been demonstrated that uses argon-plasma activation and FRP to
graft pH-responsive PMAA polymer brushes from microporous PP. It was
clearly evident from the ATR-IR spectra that the PMAA polymer brushes
had been grafted and functionalized via a two-step PPM strategy to
generate photochromic SP-containing PMA–SP polymer brushes.
Both PMAA- and PMA–SP-modified membranes were successfully
shown to be smart materials that could switch in wettability and permeability
in response to either pH or light as external stimulus. Switching
was demonstrated using static water CA and water-flux measurements
with respect to their GL.
In addition, photochromic PMA–SP brushes show a reversible
switch in color upon alternating visible- and UV-light irradiation.
The flux properties of pH-switched PMAA-modified membranes were dominated
by the swelling of the brushes and influenced little by the hydrophilicity
of the surface. By contrast, hydrophilicity changes dominated the
photon-induced switching of the SP-modified membranes.

The advantage
of the presented approach lies in its simplicity
and versatility. The application of responsive systems to influence
hydrophilicity or pore size via swelling of the material is of great
interest for the controlled separation or transport of dissolved species.
