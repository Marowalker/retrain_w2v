The title compound
(2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-methylacetophenone, 1) was isolated
as chromophore from aged cellulosic pulps.
The peculiar feature of the compound is its weak aromatic system that
can be converted into nonaromatic (quinoid or cyclic aliphatic) tautomers,
depending on the conditions and reaction partners. In alkaline media,
the participation of quinoid canonic forms weakens aromaticity, whereas
in neutral and acidic media, the strong hydrogen bond between the
2-hydroxyl group and the acetyl moiety plays an important role in
favoring quinoid tautomers. As a result, compound 1,
with quinoid contributions being already “preset”, is
relatively stable toward oxidation and hardly undergoes alkylation
or nitration at CH-6, whereas the 2,4,5-trimethoxyderivative, being
“properly” aromatic and even more sterically hindered,
is readily alkylated or nitrated. The lability of the aromatic system
is best demonstrated by the unusual reaction of 1 with
hydroxylamine, producing a tetroxime that is derived from its 2,4,5-triketo
tautomer. The high oxidative stability and low reactivity of the compound
hinder oxidative bleaching of this chromophore in cellulosic pulps
and detection reactions for analytical purposes.

Introduction
The past several years
have seen considerable progress in the identification
of chromophores—literally “color carriers” in
ancient Greek—from cellulosic matrices, such as pulps, papers,
bacterial cellulose, cotton, and others. Analysis of these compounds
has been hampered by their very low concentration in the ppb range
and the diversity of colored compounds, all of which combine to produce
the observed overall yellowing effect. With the “chromophore
release and identification” procedure for isolation of cellulosic
chromophores,1−3 such compounds became accessible and their structure,
which until then could only be approximated and guessed at based on
spectroscopic methods, could now be directly determined. Chromophore
isolation has been performed for different cellulosic matrices,4−6 and the products of the procedure have been shown to belong to three
key classes: hydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinones, hydroxy-[1,4]-naphthoquinones,
and 2-hydroxyacetophenones.7 These compounds
are generated according to the complex condensation pathways from
oxidized, “aged” carbohydrate moieties and ubiquitous
for cellulosic matrices.

One of the substances thus found6 was
the title compound, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-methylacetophenone (THMA, 1), a highly substituted acetophenone that can also be thought
of as a derivative of 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene (3, hydroxyhydroquinone).
As for all of the cellulosic chromophores, the chemistry of the compound
was of great interest, particularly with regard to oxidation and bleaching
chemistry, under conditions that are mild enough to leave the cellulose
unharmed. For comparison, we also used the nonmethylated parent compound
2,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone (THA, 2) in parallel experiments.
The studies of the chemical behavior held some surprises and led to
some unexpected but interesting detours into questions of aromaticity,
which we would like to communicate within the present account.

Results
and Discussion
A prominent feature of THMA and THA, present
both in neutral and
acidic solution media, is the exceptionally strong hydrogen bond between
the 2-OH group and the carbonyl oxygen, as illustrated by the 1H NMR resonance of about 12 ppm (see Experimental
Section). This strong H-bonding causes a partial blocking of
the 2-OH group, which shows a decreased reactivity. Acetylation under
standard conditions (Ac2O/pyridine), for instance, produces
the 4,5-diacetate after 30 min. This outcome did not change even after
prolonged reaction times of 24 h. Treatment of 1 with
BF3/acetic acid complex, afforded the 4,5-diacetate as
well. The 2-OH group was apparently not acetylated due to its involvement
in strong H-bonding. A similar reaction behavior with a largely unreactive
ortho-hydroxy group has been observed for a structurally similar 2-hydroxy-acetophenone
related to α-tocopherol.8,9

Hydroxyhydroquinone
(3), having an OH pattern similar
to TH(M)A, is highly prone to oxidation. Exposure of its solutions,
in particular alkaline ones, to air causes fast oxidation, accompanied
by progressing discoloration. This oxidative instability is even more
pronounced, and almost notorious, for pyrogallol (4,
1,2,3-trihydroxybenzene), which can even be used to effectively remove
oxygen from gas streams that are passed through its alkaline solution.
It was surprising to see that THMA was much less susceptible to oxidation
than one would expect in general from polyhydroxybenzenes, or based
on the highly oxidizable hydroquinone structure. THMA was completely
stable against air over a period of days in the solid state. 1 M solutions
in distilled water, acetone, or ethanol were stable against air over
24 h with compound losses smaller than 3%, whereas similar solutions
of pyrogallol or hydroxyhydroquinone showed no more remaining starting
material after that time. After 96 h in air (replacing evaporated
solvents every 24 h), only 8% of the THMA in 1 M solutions was oxidized.
Even in 3 M aqueous sodium hydroxide, 1 M THMA was relatively slowly
consumed, 24% after 5 h and 63% after 12 h. By contrast, under similar
conditions, pyrogallol (4) was completely converted after
30 min and hydroxyhydroquinone (3) after 75 min.

When the three hydroxyl groups of TMHA were methylated, the resulting
2,4,5-trimethoxy-3-methylacetophenone (5) reacted faster
than the parent compound with its free hydroxyl groups: a 1 M solution
of 5 in 3 M NaOH in aqueous methanol (water/methanol,
v/v = 1:1) showed 32% conversion after 5 h and 66% after 12 h. This
was, at least at a first glance, a quite counterintuitive result:
an O-protected polyphenol being oxidatively less stable than the nonprotected
parent compound. The deoxo-derivative 7, in which the
acetyl motif in THMA was replaced by an ethyl group, showed a high
lability toward oxygen, the reaction rate being in the same order
of magnitude as that of pyrogallol and hydroxyhydroquinone. The apparent
oxidative stability of T(H)MA allows the technically important conclusion
that bleaching with molecular oxygen (in an O stage) will have little
effect on this cellulosic chromophore, and likely also on similarly
substituted polyhydroxybenzenes, such as some hydroxylated guaiacyl
structures in technical lignins.

Methylation at the benzene
core, a special case of Friedel–Crafts
alkylations, is a typical reaction of aromatic systems. As an electrophilic
aromatic substitution (SEAr), the reaction occurs more easily with more electron-rich
aromatic systems. Obviously, also the steric accessibility of the
free aromatic position will influence the methylation rate, although
neighboring (ortho) hydroxyl and methyl substituents do not have any
significant steric shielding. If those steric effects are neglected
in a first approximation, the methylating action of a suitable system
can well be used to qualitatively assess the relative aromaticity
and reactivity of a probe compound. We used a 0.5 M solution of the
probe compounds in tetrahydrofuran, reacting with 5 M methyl iodide
in the presence of 2% BF3 etherate at room temperature
for 15 min. Longer reaction times of 90 min helped to more effectively
differentiate between less reactive compounds. The consumption of
the starting materials reflects its reactivity (neglecting a small
error introduced by double methylation in some cases). Evidently,
activating (electron-donating) groups, such as hydroxy and methoxy
moieties, increased the reactivity of the remaining free aromatic
positions, whereas deactivating (electron-withdrawing) groups, such
as acetyl, lowered the reactivity. “Activating” and
“deactivating” refers to the sum of inductive and mesomeric
effects that a substituent exerts on the aromatic system to which
it is attached. These effects of substituents as well as the resulting
directing action with regard to further substituents are well-known
concepts from organic chemistry.10 They
have become widely applied as linear free energy (LFE) relationships,
the Hammett and the Kamlet–Taft equations being the most common
ones.11

Expectedly, the reactivity,
i.e., the rate at which the compound
is methylated, increases with the number of activating substituents.
The positive and negative effects were additive, as expected according
to the LFE concept, with the effect of methoxy groups being stronger
than that of hydroxyl groups. In general, compounds with one hydroxyl/methoxy
group reacted slower than the ones with two, and these, in turn, reacted
slower than aromatic systems with three activating OH/OMe groups.

Hydroxyhydroquinone (3) and pyrogallol (4) were among the fastest reacting compounds in the test system, being
consumed with conversions above 80% after 10 min. The yield of trimethylhydroquinone
(9), although having only two hydroxyl groups, was similarly
high, proving that steric hindrance did not play any significant role,
so that the last remaining free aromatic position was readily methylated.
Acetophenones with three hydroxyl groups in patterns different from
TH(M)A, such as the 2,3,4-trihydroxyacetophenone (10)
and 3,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone (11), which can be considered
to be acetyl derivatives of hydroxyhydroquinone and pyrogallol, behaved
similarly: the acetyl group had only a minor deactivating effect.
The corresponding methoxy derivatives reacted even faster (formulae
and data not shown). To our surprise, THMA (1) and its
methyl-less parent compound THA (2) were extremely slowly
consumed, only 3% (5%, respectively) after 90 min. Their rate was
thus slower than that of chlorobenzene (7% after 90 min), which is
usually considered a rather deactivated aromatic system. The 2,4,5-trimethoxy
counterparts of TH(M)A, compounds 5 and 6, by contrast, reacted very fast and in the same order as hydroxyhydroquinone
(3), pyrogallol (4), and the other trihydroxyacetophenones
(10, 11). As in the above oxidation case (see Figure 1, Schemes 1 and 2), TH(M)A
behaved rather unexpectedly, in both instances not showing the typical
chemical behavior of a polyhydroxybenzene as a highly activated aromatic
system.

Figure 1 THMA (1), TMA (2), and derivatives.

Scheme 1 Oxidative Stability of Trihydroxyacetophenones
and Derivatives
Scheme 2 Reactivity toward
Methylation (Friedel–Crafts Alkylation)
High
reactivity—hydroxyhydroquinone
(3), pyrogallol (4), trimethylhydroquinone
(9), and trihydroxyacetophenones 10 and 11; low reactivity—2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-methylacetophenone
(THMA, 1) and 2,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone (THA, 2).

It was not unlikely that the strong
hydrogen bond between the acetyl
group and the ortho-hydroxy group, which, as has been mentioned, causes
differential reactivity among the hydroxyls, could have some general
influences on the overall reactivity of the molecule. To understand
such putative effects better, we used the TH(M)A-derivative in which
the keto oxygen was reduced, i.e., the compound carrying an ethyl
instead of the ethanone moiety. The effect on the chemical behavior
was quite drastic as portrayed above: both oxidative stability and
electrophilic substitution (ring methylation) behavior became almost
identical to that of hydroxyhydroquinone (3), and the
former difference of TH(M)A from structurally similar hydroxybenzenes
was completely eliminated.

The peculiar reactivity of TH(M)A
was evidently not a consequence
of the hydroxyl substitution or the substitution pattern alone because
hydroxyhydroquinone, with the same hydroxyl pattern, was oxidatively
highly unstable and easily underwent ring methylation, both in stark
contrast to the THMA behavior. Similarly, the presence of an additional
acetyl group per se could not be the reason: as mentioned, 2,3,4-trihydroxyacetophenone
(10) and 3,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone (11) reacted very similarly to hydroxyhydroquinone or pyrogallol, but
very differently from THMA. Also, the ortho-hydroxyacetophenone
motif on its own could not be the sole trigger of the reactivity differences—simply
from comparison to ortho-hydroxyacetophenone itself
and all of the other “well-behaving” ortho-hydroxyacetophenones. Thus, we speculated that the combination of
one ortho-hydroxyacetyl motif, three hydroxyl groups
in total, and a 2,4,5-trihydroxy substitution pattern might be the
reason for the reactivity peculiarity observed.

An interesting
point in this regard came from cellulose chromophore
chemistry—which was not only the reason why we stumbled upon
THMA, but then also set us on the right track to better understand
its—at first admittedly rather puzzling—chemical behavior.
2,5-Dihydroxy-[1,4]-benzoquinone (DHBQ, 12), a key chromophore
in cellulosics, is an especially stable compound.12−14 Its dianion
is strongly resonance-stabilized, with two delocalized negative charges
and four chemically and magnetically equivalent C–O moieties
(Scheme 3). The dianion
is highly symmetric and has four C–O motifs of equal bond lengths.
In an acidic medium and solid state, the bond lengths between the
bridging hydrogen and the two neighboring oxygens are equidistant,
so that the stabilized dianion structure is still maintained. DHBQ
(12) and THA (2) are similar with regard
to the strongly H-bonded ortho-OH groups and the hydroxyl substitution
patterns, with the difference that one OH in DHBQ is replaced by the
acetyl group in THA.

Scheme 3 Analogy between THA (2) and
DHBQ (12) and
Their Dianions, Respectively
If we hypothesize that THA’s acetyl moiety can
easily assume
its enol form, facilitated by the “prebound” hydrogen
from the ortho-OH, the result is an ortho-quinoid
structure, actually an ortho-quinone methide derivative
(2a in Scheme 3). The acetyl’s keto–enol tautomerism is obviously
coupled with the formation of a keto group from the ortho-OH, and
in this way the two interlinked tautomerisms would go hand in hand
with an aromatic-to-quinone conversion. A similar tautomerism leads
to para-quinone methide 2b, this time
involving the 4-hydroxyl group instead of the 2-OH.

This alone
cannot yet account for the special reactivity of THMA
because ortho-hydroxyacetophenone, for instance,
should then react in a similar fashion, which it obviously does not.
Assuming that the formation of the ortho-quinoid
structure and the loss of aromaticity enables the two remaining hydroxyl
groups also to undergo keto–enol tautomerism, finally resulting
in a cyclohexane system (2c in Schemes 3 and 4), it would explain the observed inertness toward oxygen and electrophilic
substitution (methylation). Analogously, double deprotonation of either 2a or 2b leads to a dianionic structure (22–) for which a resonance stabilization
similar to that of the DHBQ dianion (122–) can be assumed. In these processes, the hydrogen bridge between
the acetyl group and the vicinal OH group quasi allows for a keto–enol
tautomerism, actually a [1,3]-sigmatropic proton shift, without the
actual “movement” of the hydrogen. The bond order changes
are not accompanied by a significant rearrangement of the atomic positions.
This way, THA/THMA, and their dianions in particular, would possess
inherent quinoid canonic contributions that weaken the aromatic system.
Due to the possibility of undergoing tautomerism and the stabilization
of the resulting quinoid structures, THA/THMA possess a “pseudoquinoid”
character that accompanies or superimposes on its aromatic one, explaining
the peculiar reaction behavior.

Scheme 4 Neat Conversion of TH(M)A into the
Corresponding Tetroximes
If this hypothesis is true, the keto counterparts of the
ring hydroxyl
groups should be trappable by appropriate derivatizations, anchoring
the trihydroxybenzene ring system in its cyclohexanetrione form. Intriguingly
(but in a way hoped for), THA/THMA reacted with hydroxylamine, producing
a tetroxime, involving the three keto tautomers of the ring hydroxyls
and the acetyl carbonyl group in addition. Whereas the reaction with
hydroxylamine gave yields of approximately 60% and the product was
unstable when stored in air, the corresponding O-benzyloxime
derivative, obtained by reaction between THMA and O-benzyl hydroxylamine, gave superb yields of 98% and produced a crystalline,
air-stable tetra-O-benzyl-tetroxime. In other words,
treatment of THMA with hydroxylamine (derivatives) cancels its aromaticity
and converts it into a cyclohexa-1,3,4-trione derivative, and the
same applies to THA analogously. Because this does not happen with
either hydroxyhydroquinone (3) or the ethyl derivatives
(7, 8), the acetyl group must be a crucial
factor in this process: the preformed ortho-quinoid
(ortho-quinone methide) canonic form weakens the
overall aromaticity and at the same time enables and facilitates enol-to-keto
conversions of the involved hydroxyl groups. A recent study has addressed
electron localization in 1,2-benzoquinones.15

Calculations have been applied to support the experimental
results
indicating the pseudoquinoid character of 1 and 2 that is superimposed on the aromaticity in the two molecules.
An analysis of the aromaticity of the molecules 1 to 11 can explain their differences in reactivity in the “classical”
phenol/aromatic reactions of oxidation and Friedel–Crafts type
methylation as well as the formation of oximes in reaction with hydroxyl
amines in the case of 1 and 2. Aromaticity
cannot be measured or calculated directly, as it is not a defined
physical observable.16 Because there is
no fixed formula or method of describing or comparing aromaticity,
alternative methods have to be found. One approach is certainly the
experimental observation of a molecule’s behavior in reactions
that are typical for aromatic systems, such as benzene or phenols
and aromatic polyols, i.e., compounds 3, 4, and 7. Alternatively, computational methods have been
proposed to describe and quantify aromaticity.17−20 A concept that is simple and
well established is the calculation of harmonic oscillator model of
aromaticity (HOMA) values.21,22 The HOMA model is based
on the first geometrical aromaticity index A, introduced
by Julg and François in 1967.23 This
index A is based in the observation that in the fully
aromatic benzene all of the C–C bonds are equidistant, but
cyclohexane also has equal bond lengths, such that A was not able to recognize the aliphatic (i.e., nonaromatic) character
of cyclohexane and could not be used to compare aromaticity among
molecules. This drawback of A was overcome by the
introduction of the HOMA concept,21 in
which a fully aromatic compound would result in a HOMA value of 1
and a nonaromatic compound would have a value of 0. Other concepts
aiming at assessing aromaticity are nucleus-independent chemical shifts
(NICS)20 and the calculation of the anisotropy
of the magnetically induced current density (ACID) concept.24,25 When we calculated the HOMA values of the compounds 1–11 according to Ostrowski et al.,22 we found them matching the experimental behavior
astoundingly well. HOMA values were then compared with the NICS results
of the compounds 1–11. NICS(0) and
NICS(1) were calculated for each compound. NICS(0) represents the
absolute chemical shielding of a virtual nucleus in the ring plane,
whereas NICS(1) for a virtual nucleus 1 Å perpendicular to the
center of the ring plane. NICS values are given with a negative sign,
in analogy with the experimental NMR chemical shifts. Consequently,
the lowest NICS values represent the highest aromaticity, which is
reverse for HOMA. NICS(1) is the recommended as the best measure for
π-electron delocalization20 and shown
in Table 1.

Table 1 HOMA and NICS(1) Values of 1–11 Optimized at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) Level
of Theory
compound	HOMA value	NICS(1)	
1	0.927	–9.72	
2	0.929	–9.62	
3	0.994	–10.46	
4	0.998	–10.76

9	0.981	–9.97	
10	0.960	–10.34	
11	0.991	–10.71	
The compounds hydroxyhydroquinone (3) and pyrogallol
(4) had the highest HOMA values, 0.994 and 0.998, respectively.
Thus, they can be considered as the systems with the highest aromaticity
among the compounds tested, a fact that is well supported by their
very fast oxidation and Friedel–Crafts type ring methylation.
HOMA values of compounds 7–11 were
still quite high, ranging between 0.993 and 0.969. The compounds that
behaved the least like aromatic compounds in oxidation and methylation
reactions, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-methylacetophenone (THMA, 1) and 2,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone (THA, 2), indeed
had the lowest HOMA values of 0.927 and 0.929, respectively. Finally,
2,4,5-trimethoxy-3-methylacetophenone (5), with its experimental
behavior located between the “pure” aromatics 4, 3, and 7–11 and the pseudoquinoid compounds 1 and 2, had a corresponding HOMA value of 0.953, which is lower than the
values of 4, 3, 7–11 but higher than those of 1 and 2. The HOMA calculation was thus found to be an excellent tool for
describing the observed experimental differences of THMA (1) and TMA (2) compared to structurally similar compounds
(3–11). The influence of strong H-bonding,
the ortho-hydroxyacetyl motif found in 1 and 2, and the presence of three hydroxyl groups
in combination with a 2,4,5-trihydroxy substitution pattern certainly
cannot be neglected. HOMA, however, clearly confirmed the weakening
of aromaticity by the ortho-quinone motif of 1 and 2, as predicted by the formation of oximes
when THMA and TMA were reacted with hydroxylamine and its derivatives.
The NICS(1) values resulted in a similar pattern as the HOMA calculations:
the compounds 1 and 2, the least aromatic
compounds according to experimental behavior and HOMA results, also
gave the highest NICS(1) values of −9.72 and −9.62,
respectively. Furthermore, 3 and 4, compounds
of high aromaticity, ranked high in HOMA and low in NICS(1) calculations:
in HOMA calculations, they had the highest values; indeed, 4 gives
also the lowest NICS(1) value of all compounds (−10.76) and
the structure 3 is the third lowest with −10.46.
The result of structures 10 and 11 for NICS(1)
indicates a very high aromaticity, with −10.34 and −10.71,
respectively, in the range of 3 and 4. These
values are lower (i.e., indicating higher aromaticity) than the results
of 5 and 6, that—according to experimental
and HOMA—were less typical aromatic structures than 10. Similarly, for the other compounds 7, 8, and 9, the NICS(1) results point in the same direction
as the HOMA values obtained.

Conclusions
The compound 2,4,5-trihydroxy-3-methylacetophenone
(THMA, 1) and its derivative 2,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone
(THA, 2) were subjected to a series of investigations
regarding
their reactivity. Their behavior in classical reactions of aromatic
hydrocarbons was remarkable in that they resist oxidation remarkably
well, and the methylation on their benzene core is equally slow. The
low reactivity is especially striking when compared with structurally
similar compounds. Hydroxyhydroquinone (3) and pyrogallol
(4), both benzenetriols, readily undergo methylation
and are well-known for their easy oxidation. The compounds 3,4,5-trihydroxyacetophenone
(10) and 2,3,4-trihydroxyacetophenone (11), structurally related even closer to 1 and 2 by the acetyl and the three hydroxyl groups present, reacted considerably
faster in Friedel–Crafts methylation and oxidation reactions.
The strong H-bonding between the hydroxyl hydrogen and the acetyl
motif in hydroxyl acetophenones is an obvious reason for decreased
reactivity of these compounds. Keto–enol tautomerisms taking
place in T(H)MA result in ortho-quinoid structures,
representing an aromatic-to-quinone conversion. Subsequent tautomerisms
involving the two remaining hydroxyl groups result in a cyclohexane
system and explain the observed lack of reactivity toward oxygen and
electrophilic substitution (methylation). Analogously, double deprotonation
at alkaline pH leads to a resonance stabilization similar to that
of the DHBQ dianion. Thus, T(H)MA possesses a pseudoquinoid character
that could be confirmed by derivatizations, with the trihydroxybenzene
ring system fixed in its cyclohexanetrione form. Calculated HOMA values
were indeed representative for the quinoid character of T(H)MA, with
their aromaticity values that were lower than those for “fully”
aromatic molecules such as pyrogallol and hydroxyhydroquinone. NICS(1)
calculations were in good accordance with HOMA and experimental results,
although HOMA matched the experimental behavior slightly better than
NICS(1).

Experimental Section
General
NMR spectra of dry samples
were recorded on
a Bruker Avance II 400 instrument (Rheinstetten, Germany) with a resonance
frequency of 400.13 MHz for 1H and 100.62 MHz for 13C. The samples were dissolved in perdeuterated solvents chloroform,
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or pyridine (99.8% D, Euriso-top, Saint-Aubin,
France). Raw data processing was carried out with ACD/NMR Processor
Academic Edition. Signal assignment was accomplished using attached
proton test and two-dimensional NMR techniques (correlation spectroscopy,
heteronuclear single-quantum correlation spectroscopy, and heteronuclear
multiple-bond correlation spectroscopy). The chemical shift values
are given in δ ppm values relative to tetramethylsilane, and respective
coupling constants are given in Hertz. Fourier transform infrared
experiments were performed on a Perkin-Elmer Frontier infrared Single-Range
spectrometer (Waltham, MA) in attenuated total reflection mode (diamond/ZnSe
crystal, LiTaO3 detector, KBr windows). Elemental analyses
were done on a EURO EA 3000 CHNS-O instrument from HEKAtech (Wegberg,
Germany) at the Microanalytical Laboratory of Vienna University. Halide
contents (Cl) were determined by argentometry.

Thin-layer chromatography
was performed on Silica gel 60 F254 precoated glass plates (Merck).
Flash column chromatography was performed on Silica gel 60 from Merck
(Darmstadt, Germany). Solvents were purchased in synthesis grade from
Roth, Sigma-Aldrich, and VWR and used as received. Reagents were obtained
from Sigma-Aldrich, TCI, and Fluka. Melting points were determined
on a Kofler hot stage microscope and are uncorrected.

Computational
Details
The substances 1–11 were optimized
and frequency calculations ensured the absence of imaginary frequencies.
Computations were carried out at the M06-2X/6-311++G(d,p) level of
theory, as implemented by the Gaussian 09 program package (Wallingford,
CT).28 The integration grid was set to
ultrafine and Grimme’s D3 dispersion correction applied. HOMA
values were calculated according to the formulae given in ref (22). NICS values were calculated
according to ref (20).
