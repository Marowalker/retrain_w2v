Paper-based materials are highly
desirable as packaging
materials due to their numerous advantages that include low cost,
renewability, and biodegradability. However, their hydrophilicity
has limited their range of applications. Reported herein is a facile
and economical approach for the preparation of biodegradable water-resistant
paper for food-contact applications. Commercial printing paper and
cup papers are coated with melamine, which is FDA approved for food-contact
applications. Subsequently, a water-repellent outer layer is applied
using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)–isocyanate. A relationship
between the PDMS concentration and water contact angles (WCAs) of
the obtained coating was studied. Typically, the coated cup paper
and printing paper had coating loadings of 1.61 ± 1.10 and 0.93
± 0.74 wt %, respectively. After the coatings had been applied,
the WCAs were very high (>125°), and water absorption had
decreased by 70% for printing paper and by 35% for cup paper. Considering
the facile fabrication method and the low-cost food-safe raw materials,
herein, this approach will have great potential for the large-scale
production of materials for use in food- and nonfood contact applications.

1 Introduction
The annual production
of plastic has reached 407 million tons globally.1 Approximately 38% of all plastics produced is
used in the packaging sector because of their excellent properties.
Meanwhile, ∼244 million tons of plastic annually are disposed
of either in landfills or ends in the ocean. To address this problem,
greener alternatives, such as biodegradable plastic and paper-based
packaging materials, are highly desirable.

Paper, paperboard,
and corrugated board are widely used materials in the packaging and
distribution sectors due to their numerous advantages, including their
low cost, reliance on renewable feedstocks, and their biodegradable
nature. Approximately 40 million tons of paper and paperboard were
generated in 2014, of which 75.4% was recycled and composted in the
United States according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.2 Despite the low cost and environmental benefits
of paper and paper-based materials, they have limited applicability
due to their poor water resistance.

A common approach to improve
the water resistance of paper-based materials is to laminate them
with a plastic film. For example, disposable paper cups bear a water-resistant
low-density polyethylene (LDPE) inner liner that prevents the direct
contact between a liquid and the water-absorbing paper.3 However, after use, the separation of paper from
plastic is difficult, and thus paper cups end up in landfills or the
ocean. Biobased plastic, such as poly(lactic acid), (PLA) inner layers
are also used as alternatives to LDPE.4,5 However, PLA
and paper cellulose biodegrade in different environments because PLA
is compostable (biodegradable under industrial compost conditions
only at temperature 60 °C in a week).6 Wax is also commonly used to enhance the water resistance, but wax
has poor crack resistance as well as low thermal resistance.7,8 Thus, challenges still remain with the development of environmentally
friendly water-resistant paper-based materials

Recently, research
interest has grown in the development of recyclable and biodegradable
(being decomposed into basic molecules by microorganisms, and thus
they can reduce the strain on our landfills) paper-based materials
with good water-resistance properties for use in packaging, the medical
industry, food storage, bioassay devices or microfluidics.9−11 Considerable research has
been undertaken through various approaches, such as paper sizing,12−16 chemical modification (layer-by-layer,17,18 grafting approach,19−21 etc.),
and physiochemical modification (plasma etching, laser, etc.)22 However, most of these techniques are not applicable
for practical large-scale production due to their time-consuming processes,
reliance on costly raw materials, nonsuitability for food-contact
applications, and the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. Thus,
the development of a facile, low-cost, safe for food contact, and
scalable approach remains as a critical practical challenge.

The coating of paper with water-repellent materials is considered
as a simple and commercially viable approach to develop biodegradable
water-resistant paper. Typically, compounds with low surface energies,
such as fluorinated polymers, polysiloxanes23,24 or
higher alkanes, are applied to fabricate a hydrophobic coating for
paper. Although fluorochemicals render excellent water resistance
due to their low surface energies, demands have arisen for the phasing
out of these materials from use in paper coatings due to their toxicity
and environmental concerns.25,26 Alternatively, polysiloxanes
and higher alkanes have attracted great attention due to their nontoxic
nature, affordability, and environmental friendliness.27 Due to their lower surface tension, polysiloxanes
render greater hydrophobicity than is offered by higher alkanes.28 For example, a mechanically durable superhydrophobic
coating has been applied onto fibrous cellulose surfaces.29 Considering the global importance of plastic-free
water-repellent paper, Kotkamills’ has introduced a new plastic-free
and easily recyclable paper AEGLE Barrier Light.30 To the best of our knowledge, however, have been no prior
reports on the fabrication of water-resistant paper using fully biodegradable,
low-cost materials, with suitability for food-contact applications.

In this study, water-resistant coatings for paper are reported.
These coatings rely on polysiloxanes, which are affordable and biocompatible
materials31 that biodegrade into nontoxic
silicate minerals32−34 and
thus are safe for food processing.35−37 To promote firm binding
of the poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS) onto paper substrates, melamine was used as a primer. Melamine
is a FDA-approved material for food-contact applications (tolerable
level is 0.63 mg/kg of body weight, per day)38 that exhibits superior binding to paper because it is a strong hydrogen
donor as well as an acceptor, thus providing it with excellent performance
as a primer. Meanwhile, the use of PDMS–isocyanate (NCO) enables
the chemical grafting of PDMS to melamine via a biodegradable urea
linkage formed as a result of a reaction between the NCO and amine
groups of PDMS and melamine, respectively.39 In the absence of melamine, the bonding between PDMS and paper would
be weak, and the PDMS could be readily washed away from the paper.
As a result, water-resistant-coated paper bears PDMS as its outer
layer that is firmly held onto the paper substrate by an intermediate
melamine layer. This method is facile, economical, and suitable for
large-scale production. The obtained melamine–PDMS coating
exhibits excellent water resistance.

2 Results
and Discussion
In this study, a novel
fabrication approach has been developed to prepare a biodegradable
water-resistant paper from low-cost raw materials. To obtain biodegradable
water-resistant paper via this strategy, paper (cellulose) is coated
with biodegradable melamine and PDMS using a dual-layer fabrication
approach. Melamine is selected because it binds strongly to the paper
via hydrogen bonding. In addition, one or more of the three −NH2 moieties on the triazine core of melamine react immediately
with the NCO group of the PDMS–NCO, and thus the PDMS chains
bind firmly to the paper through the melamine primer. The PDMS–NCO
was chosen because NCO reacts with the NH2 groups of melamine
cleanly and efficiently even in the presence of water. As it is critical
that each PDMS–NCO chain should have at least one NCO group
to react with melamine, PDMS–NCO was thus prepared by mixing
PDMS–NH2 with a 10-fold excess of NCO groups. It
is important to note that due to the low cost and commercial availability
of the raw materials (melamine, paper, PDMS), this approach is commercially
viable for numerous real-world applications.

Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) analysis was performed to confirm the successful application
of PDMS onto the paper. Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectra of the printed paper (a) and cup paper
(b) at various stages during the fabrication process. The melamine
C–N stretching in IR for the melamine-primed paper overlapped
with that from the uncoated paper at 1553 cm–1.39 The melamine–PDMS-primed paper exhibits
several characteristic peaks corresponding to the PDMS. For example,
the peak at 1260 cm–1 corresponds to the stretching
vibration of the −CH3 groups in the Si–CH3 moieties of PDMS, whereas the peak at 798 cm–1 represents the −CH3 rocking and Si–C stretching
of PDMS. Thus, the FTIR spectrum indicated that PDMS had been successfully
applied onto the paper substrate.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) printing
paper and (b) cup paper.

Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) was used to evaluate the thermal stability of the coating. As
shown in Figure 2,
the initial weight loss observed below 120 °C was attributed
to the moisture loss. Meanwhile, the weight loss encountered between
200 and 270 °C was attributed to the decomposition of melamine,40 whereas the decomposition of PDMS occurred over
the temperature range of 400–500 °C.41 The absence of peaks between 200 and 270 °C suggests
the absence of free melamine presumably underwent reaction with the
terminal −NCO group of PDMS–NCO. Overall, the TGA indicated
that the coated paper had greater thermal stability than that of the
uncoated paper, and thus the thermal stability of paper was improved
after the coating. This also suggests that the coated paper is suitable
for applications, in which the material may be exposed to temperatures
reaching up to ∼220 °C as it is thermally stable up to
this temperature.

Figure 2 TGA traces of unmodified paper and melamine–PDMS
primed paper for (a) printing paper, (b) cup paper.

The theoretical and experimental loadings
of the coating are shown in Table 1. The theoretical load value is not as accurate as
the experimental load value because paper substrates were sequentially
immersed into two solutions, in which there was an uncontrollable
loss of substances (moisture, fillers, and sizing agent) from paper
into the coating solutions. To account for the uncontrolled loss,
the weight loss caused by the dipping into the acetone and water solutions
was quantified using uncoated paper. In future, the authors intend
to develop the spray method as that will overcome the above problem.
The experimental loads were determined by comparing the weight gain
by the coated paper and including the weight losses during the immersion
into solutions. On the basis of these experimental results, the net
coatings applied onto the cup paper and printing paper, were 1.61
and 0.93 wt %, respectively. Melamine loads are 0.39 and 0.16 wt %
for cup paper and printing paper, respectively. And we believe that
the melamine load should be lower than the obtained result because
of weight loss during dipping into the PDMS–NCO solution. Unfortunately,
we tried to study the weight increase before and after applying the
melamine primer, but there is no statistically significant change.

Figure 3a,b shows
the water-absorbance profile for printing paper and cup paper, respectively.
It is apparent that printing paper absorbed more water compared to
the cup paper, possibly because printing paper had a more porous structure.
As anticipated, the unmodified printing paper water gain was 123.96%
for the first 0.5 h and subsequently plateaued for 24 h (the duration
of water-gain test). Meanwhile, the unmodified cup paper slowly absorbed
water and reached 74.22% after 24 h. For the printing paper, the melamine-primed
paper (without PDMS) also showed a high water gain of ∼110
wt % after 24 h, which was due to the hydrophilic nature of melamine.

Figure 3 Water
uptake profiles
of (a) printing paper and (b) cup paper.

The water gain exhibited by melamine–hexamethylene
diisocyanate
trimer (HDIT)-primed paper was reduced down to 47.51 and 48.23% for
printing paper and cup paper, respectively. This was due to the relatively
hydrophobic nature of the HDIT. As expected, the best water resistance
among the tested samples was observed for the melamine–PDMS-primed
paper. For example, the water gain was reduced down to 37.77% for
the printing paper and 48.23% for cup paper. Also, the water uptake
profile indicates slow water absorption by the melamine–PDMS
primed paper, thus suggesting that this sample exhibited improved
and robust water resistance.

The water contact angles (WCAs)
were also determined for paper samples at various stages of fabrication
(see Figure 4). The
results indicate that unmodified printing paper was hydrophilic and
showed poor resistance to water because the water droplet slowly permeated
into the paper. Meanwhile, even though unmodified cup paper had a
certain degree of water resistance (with a WCA of ∼100°),
some water marks remained on the sample after 3 min of contact with
water, indicating that water had diffused into the paper substrate.
We observed that the printing paper was even more hydrophobic as treatment
of this printing paper with melamine reduced the WCA even further
from 89° for unmodified printing paper to below 65° for
the melamine-primed paper. To our surprise, the WCA for the cup paper
was improved after melamine treatment. Considering that after melamine
coating the water gain was reduced both for the printing and cup papers,
but the decrease in the WCAs for the printing paper after melamine
coating is likely originated from the highly porous structure of printing
paper. Both melamine–HDIT and melamine–PDMS primed papers
showed high WCAs. For example, in the cases involving melamine–PDMS
primed paper, the WCAs were >125° for both types of paper,
thus indicating that they exhibited excellent water resistance. These
findings were also consistent with the results obtained from the water-gain
tests. The enhanced performance that was exhibited by the PDMS-coated
paper is due to the strong water repellency of PDMS. It is noteworthy
that both melamine–HDIT and melamine–PDMS primed papers
showed no noticeable change in the WCA over time, indicating that
these coated paper samples exhibited long-term water resistance.

Figure 4 Static
behavior of water
droplets and water contact angles
(WCAs) observed on (a) printing paper and (b) cup paper.

To investigate the effect of PDMS–NCO concentrations
on the
WCAs of the resultant coatings, both printing and cup papers were
coated from PDMS–NCO solutions at different concentrations. Figure 5 demonstrates the
effect of increasing the concentrations of the coating solutions and
their influence on the WCAs. Initially, the WCAs were improved with
an increase in the PDMS concentration. For example, the highest hydrophobicity
for the cup paper was achieved at a 0.5 wt % PDMS–NCO concentration,
whereas for the printing paper the highest WCA was achieved at 0.1
wt % of PDMS–NCO. However, with further increases in the concentration
of PDMS, the WCAs gradually began to decrease. This unexpected decrease
in the WCAs with an increasing PDMS concentration can be attributed
to the fact that WCAs are influenced by surface roughness as well
as surface energy.42 Initially, increasing
the PDMS concentration yielded higher WCAs because it provided a lower
surface energy while the roughness of the paper surface was retained.
However, further increases in the PDMS concentration beyond a certain
value also likely reduced the surface roughness due to the greater
number of liquid-like PDMS chains on the surface. Therefore, it is
apparent that an optimum PDMS concentration exists (below 1 wt %)
at which the surface energy can be reduced, whereas the roughness
of the surface can be retained to provide the maximum repellency.
Interestingly, the observation of the highest WCAs at a low PDMS concentration
strengthens our claim regarding the low cost of this coating strategy.

in the water contact angles with the concentration of the PDMS–NCO
coating solution.

Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of cup paper at different
stages of fabrication are shown in Figure 6. Inset images are taken to get a close-up
view of the samples. The unmodified cup paper is comprised of a network
of fibers (Figure 6a). After the melamine coating, there is no noticeable change in
the paper texture (Figure 6b), however, fiber surface became smoother upon melamine–HDIT
coating (Figure 6c).
It is possibly due to the flexible aliphatic
HDID chains on the surface. Melamine–PDMS (Figure 6d) has fibers with much smoother
texture caused by the liquid-like PDMS chains on the surface.

SEM images of printing paper at different stages of fabrications
are shown in Figure 7. The unmodified cup paper is comprised of cellulosic fibers of various
diameters. Except for melamine–PDMS-coated paper (Figure 7d), where the surface
texture is smooth due to PDMS chains, the uncoated (Figure 7a), melamine-coated (Figure 7b), melamine–HDIT
coated (Figure 7c)
print papers had rough textures.

One key aspect of this coating
is the biodegradability of the coated paper. On the basis of the nature
of the materials (PDMS, melamine) used for the coating, we expect
that the coated papers are biodegradable. Also,
linkage formed by the reaction of PDMS–NCO and melamine is
urea bond, and urea bonds are biodegradable.43 Coated paper fabricated in this study has some degrees of cross-linking
due to the multifunctional nature of melamine and trifunctional HDIT,
however, even cross-linked polyurea is known to biodegrade though
at a slower rate.44 In the future, the
biodegradability studies of the coated papers will be conducted.

3 Conclusions
In
this study, we successfully applied a facile and economical approach
for the preparation of biodegradable water-resistant paper coatings.
A simple two-step dip-coating approach was used to fabricate the coated
paper. The obtained surface exhibited hydrophobic properties with
WCAs exceeding 125° at a 1 wt % loading of the coating. The water
absorbed by the coated papers was significantly reduced in comparison
with their uncoated counterparts, and also the water-gain time was
enhanced, thus confirming the high water resistance of the coated
paper. This novel approach can be extended to other types of papers
and cellulose-based materials. Considering the biocompatibility and
full biodegradability of these coatings as well as the low cost of
the raw materials, this strategy provides a viable green route for
the fabrication of disposable cups and corrugated packages.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Melamine
(purity
99%), acetone (purity 98%), and monoaminopropyl-terminated poly(dimethylsiloxane)
(PDMS–NH2) with a molecular weight of 2000 g/mol
were purchased from Sigma Aldrich and used without further purification.
Polyisocyanate (HDIT) was supplied by a proprietary manufacturer.
Printing paper was purchased at a local supermarket. Cup papers were
purchased from a local coffee shop (Spartan at Michigan State University,
MI). Prior to the application of the coating, the polymer layer on
the commercial paper cups was carefully peeled off.

4.2 Methods and Characterization
4.2.1 Fabrication
of Water-Resistant
Paper
Figure 8 shows the fabrication of the two-step approach used to achieve the
desired water-resistant paper. First, melamine was applied as a primer.
In the next step, PDMS–NCO solution was applied as a water-resistant
coating.

Figure 8 Illustration of the fabrication
procedure for the water-resistant
melamine–PDMS-primed paper.

4.2.1.1 Preparation
of PDMS–NCO Solution
First, HDIT (100 mg) was dissolved
in acetone (5 mL). Subsequently, PDMS–NH2 (200 mg
of PDMS–NH2 in 5 mL of acetone) was added into the
HDIT solution and homogenized using a vortex mixer for 30 s. The concentration
of the obtained PDMS–NCO solution was recorded as the concentration
of PDMS, i.e., 2 wt % in this case. All of the characterization and
testing were based on the formulation of 2 wt % PDMS–NCO coating.
Moreover, to study the effect of PDMS–NCO concentration on
coating properties, PDMS–NCO solution with various concentrations
(0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 wt %) were prepared by varying the amount
HDIT and PDMS–NH2 proportionally, but keeping the
amount of acetone constant.

4.2.1.2 Coating
Application
Printing paper and cup paper were
cut into 1 × 1 in.2 sections prior to coating. Aqueous
melamine solutions were prepared by dissolving melamine in hot water
at a concentration of 0.20 wt %. Paper substrates were immersed in
the melamine solution for 10 s, and they were then left under ambient
conditions for 5 min to enable solvent evaporation. These paper samples
were then dipped in a PDMS–NCO solution for 10 s. The paper
samples were subsequently allowed to dry in open air for 5 min prior
to heating at 120 °C for 1 h. The resultant coated paper samples
are referred to as melamine–PDMS-primed paper.

4.2.1.3 Preparation of Reference-Coated
Papers (without PDMS)
Samples that were only coated with
the melamine solution are from here onward referred to as melamine-primed
paper. Meanwhile, samples that were dipped into the melamine solution
and subsequently in the HDIT solution are from here onward referred
to as melamine–HDIT-primed paper.

4.2.2 Characterization
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra of unmodified paper, melamine-primed
paper, melamine–HDIT-primed paper, and melamine–PDMS-primed
paper were recorded using a Shimadzu IR Prestige21 FTIR spectrometer
(Shimadzu Co., Columbia, MD) equipped with an attenuated total reflection
attachment (PIKE Technologies, Madison, WI). A total number of 64
scans with a spectral range of 4000–400 cm–1 and a resolution of 4 cm–1 were recorded for each
sample.

Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was recorded to determine
the thermal stability and weight gain of the coated paper (from 2
wt % PDMS–NCO solution) in reference to the uncoated paper.
The TGA was performed using a Q-50 thermogravimetric analyzer (TA
Instruments, New Castle, DE). The weight loss exhibited by the samples
was recorded as a function of the temperature range from 23 to 600
°C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min under a nitrogen flow with
a flow rate of 40 mL/min.

The weight gain by the paper as a
result of the application of the coatings was quantified via gravimetric
methods. The weight of solution absorbed by paper substrates was recorded,
and the theoretical loading of the coating was calculated based on
the solution absorbed by the paper and their corresponding concentration.
The experimental load of the coating was quantified by calculating
the difference between the weight gain of the coated paper and that
of the corresponding control. The weight before and after coating
was recorded using a microbalance. To minimize the experimental error,
the control paper substrates were dipped into pure water and subsequently
into acetone. Both the control group and the coated samples were dried
under identical conditions.

To study the safety of melamine
in paper coating, the theoretical melamine loading on the coated paper
was studied using gravimetric approaches similarly to the above-mentioned
weight gain analysis. Paper substrates were dipped into deionized
water as a control. Experimental melamine loading was not studied
because melamine loading was too little, that there was no significant
difference before and after melamine primer was applied according
to preliminary test.

4.2.3 Water-Resistance Tests
Prior to testing, all of the
samples were preconditioned by drying at 70 °C under vacuum for
1 h to remove moisture. Water-gain tests were conducted by dipping
preconditioned samples into deionized water for periods of 0.5, 1,
2, 3, 5, and 24 h. The weight of each sample was recorded after wiping
excess water from the surface with a clean tissue. Water-gain was
calculated using the eq 1 1  

4.2.4 Water
Contact Angles (WCAs)
Water
contact angles (WCAs) were measured using a 590-U1 Advanced Automated
Goniometer with DROPimage Advanced software (Ramé-hart Instrument
Co., NJ). Deionized water droplet (10 μL) was placed onto the
sample and allowed the droplet to sit for 3 min before contact angle
was measured. The reported WCA values are the average of three measurements
on different areas on the surface of each sample.

4.2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
JEOL 6610 SEM (JEOL Ltd., Japan) system was used for
the SEM analysis. Samples were mounted on aluminum disks and coated
with a gold layer (10 nm thickness) using a sputtering approach. All
samples were examined with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV.
