Arginine
has significant effects on fragmentation patterns of the
protonated peptide due to its high basicity guanidine tail. In this
article, thermal dissociation of the singly protonated glycine-arginine
dipeptide (GR-H+) was investigated by performing direct
dynamics simulations at different vibrational temperatures of 2000–3500
K. Fourteen principal fragmentation mechanisms containing side-chain
and backbone fragmentation were found and discussed in detail. The
mechanism involving partial or complete loss of a guanidino group
dominates side-chain fragmentation, while backbone fragmentation mainly
involves the three cleavage sites of a1-x1+, a2+-x0, and b1-y1+. Fragmentation patterns for primary dissociation
have been compared with experimental results, and the peak that was
not identified by the experiment has been assigned by our simulation.
Kinetic parameters for GR-H+ unimolecular dissociation
may be determined by direct dynamics simulations, which are helpful
in exploring the complex biomolecules.

I Introduction
Research
on the protein structure and function is of great significance
since proteins play a vital role in all aspects of life activities.1,2 Mass spectrometry has become a key technology for determination
of amino acid sequence information in proteins.3−5 However, due
to the complex composition of proteins, many mass spectrometry data
are often not fully understood and classified.6−8 To identify
the amino acid sequence of proteins, it is important to enhance the
understanding of protein dissociation patterns. Computational simulations
provide a reliable way to study the dissociation dynamics of peptide
ions and their fragmentation patterns, providing detailed knowledge
of protein composition at the atomic level.9−11

Arginine
is important in mass spectrometric examinations of proteins
since it has a high proton affinity side chain that can effectively
capture the mobile proton, resulting in fewer backbone fragmentations
for singly protonated peptides containing arginine.12 Moreover, peptide ions are prone to undergo cyclization
and rearrangement reactions, yielding a large amount of fragment ions,
resulting in spectra that are complicated and difficult to resolve.13,14 The presence of arginine may greatly affect fragmentation patterns
of peptide ions. Glish et al. found that the cleavage of the peptide
bond between arginine and the adjacent amino acid requires more energy
than the peptides without arginine and suggested that secondary interactions
between the arginine side chain and an adjacent amino acid could be
responsible for the effects of arginine on dissociation patterns of
peptides.15 Paizs et al. investigated proton-driven
cleavage of the amide bond in arginine-containing peptide ions (GnR, n = 2–4) and proposed
three new mechanisms, including salt-bridge, anhydride, and imine
enol intermediates.16

The protonated
glycine-arginine dipeptide, abbreviated as GR-H+, is one
of the simplest dipeptide ions containing arginine,
and investigations of its dissociation and cleavage sites would be
very helpful for better understanding of more complicated peptides
containing arginine. O’Hair et al.17 demonstrated that collisional activation of protonated Gly-Arg-H+ and Arg-Gly-H+ gave the same collision induced
dissociation (CID) mass spectra by using a quadrupole ion trap instrument.
Forbes et al.14 continued the exploration
of the effect of different activation methods on the fragmentation
of above two protonated dipeptides and suggested that the variety
of experimental conditions may affect the experimental mass spectra.
For some conditions, rearrangement of the dipeptide ions to a common
structure may occur before fragmentation, leading to deviations in
the mass spectra.

Since fragmentation patterns of peptide ions
may be influenced
by the activation methods, it is important to determine the intrinsic
fragmentation mechanisms for peptide ions containing arginine.18−22 Electronic structure calculations can identify important dissociation
pathways and their transition states (TSs).23−26 However, for large molecules
such as peptides, the important dissociation pathways may be difficult,
or even impossible, to determine owing to the numerous fragmentation
possibilities. Direct dynamics simulations27,28 provide an efficient approach to interpret the mass spectrometry
studies of peptide ion fragmentation. For the simulations, the peptide
ions may be excited with thermal vibrational energies randomly distributed
among the vibration mode and sufficiently high to allow full fragmentation
within a practical simulation time scale. Hase et al. have successfully
performed direct dynamics simulations of the thermal dissociation
of the doubly protonated tripeptide threonine-isoleucine-lysine ion,
TIK(H+)2.29 Important
dissociation pathways of the peptide ion, and their corresponding
reaction probabilities, were determined versus temperature. For each
temperature, the TIK(H+)2 fragmentation probability
versus time was exponential, consistent with Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus
(RRKM) theory and transition state theory (TST).

The current
study primarily focuses on fragmentation patterns of
arginine-containing peptide ions GR-H+ by performing direct
dynamics simulations. The primary structure of GR-H+, and
its corresponding fragmentation nomenclature proposed by Roepstorff
and Fohlman,30 is depicted in Figure 1. Complete identification
of the peptide ions’ dissociation dynamics, including atomistic
dissociation mechanisms, fragmentation pathways, and reaction probabilities,
was determined by varying the vibrational temperature for the simulations.
The competition of side-chain and backbone dissociations is observed
and discussed. By determining the unimolecular rate constant k(T) and reaction probabilities for each
temperature T, the Arrhenius A-factor (A) and activation energy (Ea) were determined
for different fragmentation pathways. Through comparisons of the simulation
fragmentation patterns with available experimental data, we expect
to establish how the presence of arginine affects the fragmentation
dynamics of arginine-containing peptides. This may provide some explanations
and insights into the MS spectra of arginine-containing peptides and
further enrich the knowledge of unimolecular dissociation dynamics.

II Results and Discussion
II.A Structure of GR-H+
The
GR-H+ potential energy minimum is needed for selecting
initial conditions for the direct dynamics trajectories. As shown
in Figure 2, three
possible protonated sites, that is, imidic nitrogen of the guanidino
group (a), amino of the N-terminus (b), and carbonyl oxygen (c), were
considered for performing the optimizations. It was found that configurations
with the protonated guanidino group (a) give relatively lower energies
than for the other two conformers (b and c), which have energies 167.7
and 189.9 kJ/mol higher, a finding consistent with Paizs’s
work for protonated ariginine.12 By referencing
previous works,17,31 the three lowest-energy GR-H+ conformers for protonation at guanidino (a) were located
and are displayed in Figure 2a. We found that the energy of the conformer II given in ref (31) as the lowest-energy conformer
is close to that of conformer III with the difference of 0.4 kJ/mol
with the RM1 method, and both of them are higher in energy than conformer
I. As shown in Figure 2a, protonated guanidine of the lowest-energy conformer I has an extended
conjugated π bond, which is coplanar with a dihedral angle of
179.1°. The three N–C bond lengths and N–C–N
angles are almost the same with the values of ∼1.38 Å
and 120.0°, respectively. This is the most stable conformation,
with the protonation of the guanidino group chosen as the initial
configuration for the direct dynamics simulations. In previous works
for both TIK(H+)2 and TLK(H+)232,33 collisional simulations, Hase and co-workers
found that the lowest-energy conformers and the next lowest-energy
conformers both gave statistically the same fragmentation dynamics.
The reason is because the small difference in the potential energy
minima of the two conformers is overwhelmed by their zero-point energies
(ZPEs), which are included in the trajectory simulations. For conformers
I–III in Figure 2 in our work, the harmonic ZPEs are 183.1, 183.0, and 183.2 kcal/mol,
respectively, which are much larger than the energy differences between
them.

II.B Fragmentation
Probability and Total Rate
Constant
There are 172 dissociating trajectories out of the
400 total trajectories, and they may be classified by 66 different
primary fragmentation pathways. Here, we focus on the primary dissociation
pathways and do not consider secondary dissociations of primary dissociation
products. This latter topic would be of interest for future simulations.
The number of primary dissociation pathways tends to gradually increase
as the temperature is increased, with values of 16, 20, 22, and 40
at 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K, respectively. Correspondingly, the
total fragmentation probability increases with the increase in temperature
with values of 0.20, 0.31, 0.47, and 0.74, as shown in Figure 3. Here, we define pathways,
with a fragmentation probability greater than 3%, as principal dissociations.
There are 14 principal dissociation pathways and 52 minor pathways.
The reaction probabilities for the principal decomposition pathways
grow linearly with the increase in temperature, as presented in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Plot of reaction probability
Pr(b) relative to the total trajectories
for the unimolecular dissociation reaction of GR-H+ versus
temperature (T). The black solid line represents
the total reaction probability. The red and green dashed lines are
for principal dissociation pathways and minor pathways, respectively.
The blue and orange dotted lines are for backbone fragmentation and
side-chain fragmentation, respectively.

To discuss the fragmentation patterns of GR-H+ in detail,
it is necessary to analyze both backbone and/or the side-chain fragmentations.
The probabilities of principal paths involving side-chain fragmentation
are 0.03, 0.11, 0.20 and 0.28 for the temperatures of 2000, 2500,
3000, and 3500 K, respectively, as shown in Figure 3. For backbone fragmentation, the probability
increases from 0.09 to 0.19 with T increasing from
2000 to 3500 K. The importance of both backbone and side-chain fragmentation
grows with the increase in temperature.

The total unimolecular
rate constant at each temperature may be
determined by fitting N(t)/N(0) versus time through the equation N(t)/N(0) = exp(−kt), where N(t)/N(0) is the fraction of reactants surviving at time t.34 The slope of ln[N(t)/N(0)] versus t in Figure 4 gives the unimolecular rate constant k(T) values, which are (6.00 ± 0.27) × 1010, (2.42 ± 0.12) × 1011, (8.73 ± 0.30) ×
1011, and (1.65 ± 0.04) × 1012 s–1 for T of 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500
K, respectively. The linear fit of ln k(T) versus 1/T as presented in Figure 5 yields the Arrhenius parameters, which are Ea (activation energy) = 131.1 ± 6.3 kJ/mol
and A (pre-exponential factor) = (1.59 ± 0.46)
× 1014 s–1.

parameters are A = (1.59 ± 0.46) × 1014 s–1 and Ea = 131.1 ± 6.3 kJ/mol. The R value for the
fit is −0.993. The blue left solid diamonds are the values
obtained from the rate constant for GR-H+. The red straight
line corresponds to the fit using the Arrhenius equation.

II.C Principal Dissociation Channels and Their
Barriers
To focus on the decomposition mechanisms, the number
of trajectories for each principal path relative to the total number
of dissociating trajectories is depicted in Figure 6 as a function of temperature, and the corresponding
proportions of dissociation pathways are given in Table S1 of the Supporting Information. The 14 principal paths
and their corresponding transition states are described in Figures 7 and 8. As shown in Figure 6, the probability of most of the paths displays an ascending
trend with increasing temperature. At the higher temperatures of 3000
and 3500 K, path 4 is dominant, while paths 6 and 1 are dominant at
2000 and 2500 K, respectively. Paths 1–5 in Figure 7 involve side-chain fragmentation,
and they account for 36.0 ± 3.7% of the total dissociation trajectories.
The proportion of backbone breakage is 33.7 ± 3.6%, suggesting
that the former mechanism is even comparable to the latter. This phenomenon
is consistent with the mobile proton model, in which sequestration
of proton by the highly basic side chain leads to the less efficient
backbone fragmentation. This result is also consistent with the experimental
observation, as discussed below.

Figure 6 Proportions of 14 principal dissociation
pathways versus temperatures
of 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K. The proportions of each pathway to
total dissociation trajectories are listed in the picture. The column
length of different colors represents the reaction possibility of
each temperature, which is either 3500 K(dark blue), 3000 K(blue),
2500 K(light blue), or 2000 K(gray).

II.C.1 Side-Chain Fragmentation
II.C.1.a Reactions Producing NH3 (Pathways
1 and 2)
As shown in Figure 7a, both paths 1 and 2 are side-chain fragmentation
mechanisms. Proton transfer on the guanidino group leads to loss of
NH3, leaving either the —NH+=C=NH
or —N=C=NH2+ moiety behind.
Path 1 is the most preferred event for RG-H+ dissociation,
which accounts for 12.2 ± 2.5% of the total dissociation, in
contrast to 3.5 ± 1.4% for path 2, as depicted in Figure 6. In addition, path 1 occurred
at each temperature, whereas path 2 only occurred at the higher temperatures
of 3000 and 3500 K. The transition states for these two pathways were
calculated using the RM1 method, and their optimized structures are
given in Figure 7a.
The TSs for both paths 1 and 2 represent a concerted process, with
hydrogen transfer and C–N2 bond breakage occurring simultaneously.
For the TSs, the N–H and C–N2 bonds elongated to ∼1.41
and 1.49 Å, respectively, compared to the corresponding distances
of 1.01 and 1.36 Å for the minimum of GR-H+. The calculated
potential energy barriers for these two pathways are 176.9 and 173.6
kJ/mol.

II.C.1.b Reactions Producing
NH=C+—NH2 (Pathway 3)
As shown in Figure 7b, instead of C–N2
bond cleavage as for pathways 1 and 2, the C–N1 bond breaks
in this mechanism. Together with hydrogen transfer from N3 to N1 atom,
the product NH=C+—NH2 cation is
generated, which has the smallest m/z value of 43 among all major products. In addition, it is worth noting
that this pathway occurred at all temperatures except for the lowest
2000 K. The TS structure for path 3 has a barrier of 179.8 kJ/mol
and exhibits similar characteristics as those for paths 1 and 2 (Figure 7b).

II.C.1.c Reactions Producing Neutral Guanidine
and Protonated Guanidine (Pathways 4 and 5)
As described
in Figure 7c, proton
transfer is not involved in path 4, and the arginine residue loses
the neutral guanidine directly, generating a cation product with the m/z value of 173. By contrast, for pathway
5, the hydrogen atom on the side chain migrates to the N atom in the
guanidino group, forming protonated guanidine with the m/z value of 60. As shown in Figure 6, the contribution of path 4 is 9.3 ±
2.2%, which is larger than that of path 5 (5.2 ± 1.7%), which
is probably due to the fact that guanidine is more stable if not protonated.
Moreover, path 4 only appears at a higher temperature, and it is the
most preferred mechanism at the temperatures of 3000 and 3500 K qualitatively.

II.C.2 Backbone Fragmentation
II.C.2.a Reactions Producing a1 + x1+ (Pathways 6–9)
Paths 6–9 belong to the a1-x1+ fragmentation
type, and all are concerted reactions with
C–C bond cleavage on the backbone of glycine’s N-terminus
accompanied by proton transfer. The difference of these four mechanisms
is that the hydrogen comes from different groups, either the backbone
or the guanidino, leading to two similar products with m/z values of 202 and 203, as presented in Figure 8a. Path 6 has 8.7
± 2.2% of the dissociation, and in contrast, the respective contributions
of paths 7–9 are 2.9 ± 1.3, 2.3 ± 1.1, and 2.3 ±
1.1%, respectively, much lower than that for path 6, as shown in Figure 6. This suggests that,
for backbone fragmentation, the hydrogen on the backbone migrates
more efficiently than that on the side chain since the former proton
is closer to the fragmentation site.

II.C.2.b Reactions Producing a2+ +
x0 (Pathways 10–13)
As shown in Figure 8b, the products of paths 10–13 have
the same m/z value of 186, although
the proton comes from different groups. The C–C breakage occurs
on the carboxyl of the arginine C-terminus, leaving one HCOOH neutral
molecule and the HO–C̈–OH diradical, and an ion
with the same m/z value for all
four pathways. Formation of HCOOH derives from proton migration on
a C atom of the backbone, while HO–C̈–OH is formed
by hydrogen transfer from a N atom. Pathway 10 has the highest reaction
probability when compared with pathways 11–13, as shown in Figure 6, again testifying
to the more efficient mobility of a backbone proton.

II.C.2.c Three-Body Decomposition Mechanism (Pathway
14)
Figure 8c depicts path 14, which is a three-body decomposition mechanism
and contains amide bond cleavage with the probability of 4.7%. A proton
on guanidino migrates and attacks the amide N, resulting in the simultaneous
occurrence of a1-x1+- and b1-y1+-type backbone
fractures, releasing CO and two other products.

II.D Comparison with Experimental Results
The simulation m/z mass spectra
for thermal GR-H+ decomposition at 2000, 2500, 3000, and
3500 K are shown in Figure 9. All m/z values are identified,
and the height of the peaks characterizes the reaction probabilities.
The total number of m/z values for
both principal and minor pathways is 8, 10, 14, and 21 at 2000, 2500,
3000, and 3500 K, respectively. These values do not necessarily correspond
to the number of pathways since different pathways can produce the
same ion and one pathway can yield multiple ions. Consequently, even
though the total number of dissociation patterns is 57, the number
of total m/z values is 24.

Figure 9 Theoretical
primary m/z mass spectra of GR-H+ trajectories
for thermal dissociation at 2000, 2500, 3000,
and 3500 K, respectively.

Forbes et al.14 and O’Hair and
Farrugia17 have experimentally investigated
dissociation of protonated GR-H+ by carrying out cone-voltage
CID, quadrupole TOF CID, and quadrupole ion trap CID. Mass spectra
from the three CIDs show that the main m/z peaks are 215, 214, 175, 173, 158, 100, and 70. Among
them, m/z 215 corresponds to dissociation
paths 1 and 2, which are the dominant pathways in both the experiments
and simulations, resulting from loss of neutral NH3. These
reaction pathways are also found in Bythell et al.’s13 theoretical calculations for fragmentation of
singly protonated peptides with N-terminal arginine. The ion m/z 214 in the simulations corresponds
to a pathway releasing H2O. It is not a major pathway but
is present at both 2500 and 3500 K. It is speculated in the experiment
that m/z 175 refers to amide bond
cleavage yielding b1-y1, which is consistent with the simulation result.
The m/z values of 173 and 60 are
related to pathways 4 and 5, which give rise to the loss of neutral
and protonated guanidine from the side chain. From the experiments,
the m/z 158 peak is thought to arise from the loss
of NH3, but its structural formula could not be determined.
The simulations suggest that it is OH—CO—CH=CH—(CH2)2—HN—C+—(NH2)2, formed by c1-z1 cleavage. The m/z 203 (x1+) is abundant in the simulations
but not observed in experiments of O’Hair and Farrugia.17 This is because the ion of m/z 203 is metastable and tends to dissociate with
more simulation time. As an example, the secondary dissociations of
pathway 6, the x+ ion dissociation to form ions of m/z = 175 and 60, are given in Figure S1 of the Supporting Information, in which
both ions are observed in the experiments.

Overall, the m/z values obtained
from the simulations and experiments are consistent, but there are
still some experimental ion signals not found in the theoretical mass
spectra. Two reasons may be responsible for the inconsistency. One
is that the primary dissociations were considered in current simulations
and some ions observed in the experiments may result from the secondary
dissociations. The other reason is that more complex pathways may
occur and new ions could be observed when the trajectories run enough
long time. Our simulations run within several picoseconds, in contrast
to the microsecond timescale in the experiments, which may result
in the disappearance of some ions in theory.

III Conclusions
Different unimolecular dissociation pathways
and their probabilities
for the protonated glycine-arginine dipeptide were investigated by
direct dynamics simulations at different vibrational temperatures
of 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K. The calculated thermal dissociation
results have been compared with CID experiments, and the corresponding m/z signals in the experiment have been assigned. Some key
conclusions are listed as follows:(1) Fourteen principal dissociation pathways
were found and classified into side-chain and backbone fragmentations,
and their reaction possibilities tend to ascend with increasing temperature.
Consisting with the mobile proton model, the backbone fragmentation
is less favored for the singly protonated peptides containing arginine
due to the location effect on the proton of guanidine group.

(2) The side-chain breakage
is mainly
the partial or complete loss of the guanidino group, and the departure
of NH3 is a dominant pathway in both the experiment and
simulation corresponding to the m/z 215 peak. The backbone fragmentation mainly consists of the cleavage
at positions a1-x1+, a2+-x0, and b1-y1+. The dominant a1-x1+-type fragmentation is the concerted
reaction with C–C bond cleavage and proton transfer occurring
simultaneously.

(3) The
rate constants and Arrhenius parameters
can be determined by direct dynamics simulations, which is meaningful
in exploring the larger reaction systems.



IV Computational Methodology
IV.A Electronic Structure Theory
Since
the gradient and potential energy for the trajectories are directly
obtained from electronic structure theory, an appropriate method needs
to be chosen for the simulations. It is common to use DFT or MP2 for
small molecules, while for larger molecules such as peptides, it is
more practical to use semi-empirical Hamiltonians, such as AM1, PM3,
or RM1, which have been widely applied to macromolecular systems.35−40 In this work, the RM1 method36 was chosen
for the direct dynamics simulations because it was parameterized with
a training set of 1736 molecules, including both neutral and protonated
amino acids and representative examples of dipeptides with α-helix
and β-sheet conformations,41 and
thus, it is expected to provide more accurate barrier heights and
reaction enthalpies for organic and biochemical reactions.29,35−38 The transition states (TSs) are located for the primary dissociation
pathways 1–3 in the light of the trajectory results. It is
noteworthy that our simulations show that most of the dissociation
processes are complex, and the secondary or tertiary dissociations
often occur. In this paper, since we only focus on the primary dissociation
pathways, the TSs usually correspond to a simple direct process of
proton transfer. In a previous work on the surface-induced dissociation
(SID) of protonated glycine, gly-H+, with a diamond surface,
it was found that AM1 and MP2/6-31G(d) yield similar SID dynamics.9,42

IV.B Direct Dynamics Simulations of Thermal Activation
Direct dynamics simulations27 were performed
with the VENUS/MOPAC43−45 software package. As discussed and applied previously,46−49 for a molecule with s harmonic oscillators, the
classical RRKM and TST rate constants become identical when the unimolecular
dissociation energy E0 is much less than
the reactant’s energy E and s is large (i.e., E0/E ≪ 1 and s ≈ s –
1), resulting in the relationship of E = skBT. We refer our computational
results to experimental results reported by Forbes et al., where CID
energies were 12, 20, 25, and 40 eV, respectively.14 To compare with the experiment, here, simulations of the
thermal dissociation of GR-H+ were carried out at temperatures
of 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K. For each temperature, the initial
vibrational energy was randomly distributed among the vibration mode,
where s for the GR-H+ dipeptide is 96.
Therefore, the total vibrational energy of the ion was around 17,
21, 25, and 29 eV for 2000, 2500, 3000, and 3500 K, respectively.
These energies are in between the experimental collision energies
of 12 and 40 eV.14 It should be noted that
less than 100% of the experimental energies can be converted into
internal energy of the ion, so the simulation results can be compared
with the experimental observations qualitatively. We expect to provide
an understanding of mechanisms for the dissociations of arginine-containing
peptides in this work. A 300 K rotational energy determined by RT/2 was added to each principal axis of rotation for the
peptide ion, which was randomly rotated about its Euler angles.

Direct dynamics simulations were performed using RM1. Different integration
times of 27, 7, 3.3, and 1.6 ps were used for the temperature of 2000,
2500, 3000, and 3500 K, respectively. Since the lifetime of unimolecular
reaction decreases with the increase in temperature, the required
integration time becomes shorter with the increase in temperature.
For each temperature, 100 trajectories were calculated. Hamilton’s
equations of motion were numerically integrated with a sixth-order
symplectic algorithm.50,51 Different integration step sizes
were examined to obtain an acceptable energy conservation, and step
sizes of 0.1, 0.05, 0.01, and 0.01 fs were used for the above respective
temperatures.
