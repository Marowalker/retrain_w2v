Efficient and feasible
pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass
waste is an important prerequisite step to promote subsequent enzymatic
hydrolysis and enhance the economics of biofuels production. This
study focuses on the pretreatment of wheat straw (WS) with triethylbenzyl
ammonium chloride/lactic acid (TEBAC/LA)-based deep eutectic solvents
to enhance biomass fractionation and lignin extraction. Effects of
pretreatment time, temperature, and TEBAC/LA molar ratio on pretreatment
were evaluated systematically. Results suggested that 89.06 ±
1.05% of cellulose and 71.00 ± 1.03% of xylan were hydrolyzed
with enzyme loadings of 35 FPU cellulase and 82 CBU β-glucosidase
(per gram of dry biomass) after pretreatment by TEBAC/LA (1:9) at
373 K for 10 h. A total monosaccharide yield of 0.550 g/g WS (91.27%
of the theoretical yield) was achieved with 79.73 ± 0.93% of
lignin removal. Furthermore, the 1H–13C two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation (2D-HSQC)
NMR spectroscopy showed that the regenerated lignin (75.69 ±
1.32% purity) was mainly composed of the syringyl units and the guaiacyl
units. Overall, the results in this study provide an effective and
facile pretreatment method for lignocellulosic biomass waste to enhance
enzymatic hydrolysis saccharification.

1 Introduction
Lignocellulosic
biomass is a renewable carbon resource that stores
solar energy in the form of chemical energy through photosynthesis
of CO2 and H2O.1 With
the depletion of fossil resources and the demand for energy, combined
with the requirement of emission reduction and environmental protection,
the urgent need for renewable alternative carbon resources has arisen
in the market.2−5 Approximately 700 million tons of straw agricultural wastes, including
rice, sorghum, wheat, barley, and corn, is produced every year in
China.6

Wheat straw (WS) agricultural
residues contain a significant amount
of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose and hemicellulose
can be used as feedstocks for sustainable production of valuable platform
chemical and biofuels.7−11 Lignin is also regarded as a versatile feedstock in adhesive and
resin industries due to its renewable nature and special aromatic
structure.12 However, lignin is a cross-linked
polymer that contains aromatic precursors, which play a key role in
highly recalcitrant to chemical and biological degradation.13,14 Therefore, efficient pretreatment of lignocellulosic biomass waste
is a key step to remove lignin to improve the enzymatic hydrolysis
performance of cellulose components.14−17

Various pretreatment techniques
have been investigated and used
to remove lignin from WS, such as hydrothermal and microwave,18 steam expansion,19 acids (sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and atmospheric acetic acid,
etc.),20−22 bases (sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium
sulfide, and sodium borohydride, etc.),23−25 organic solvents (methanol,
ethanol, butanol, and glycerol),26−28 and ionic liquids (1-butyl-3-methy-limidazolium
acetate, 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate, N,N-dimethylethanolammonium formate, [Emim] [OAC], cholinium
taurinate, cholinium glycinate, cholinium levulinate, and cholinium
pentanoate, etc.).29−32 Each method possesses its respective advantages and disadvantage
in terms of pretreatment cost, energy requirement, operational simplicity,
reaction condition, and difficulty of industrial applications.33 For example, the cellulose and xylan
conversions of WS pretreated by steam explosion integrated with 2%
(w/v) sodium hydroxide were 87.8 and 43.8%, respectively. However,
these pretreatment methods usually require a high pretreatment temperature
(198–200 °C) and pressure (1.03–13 bar), resulting
in the total loss of xylan.19,23 Although pretreatment
of WS using ionic liquids (ILs) overcomes some of these disadvantages
of traditional techniques in terms of equipment corrosion, high temperature,
and pressure, their use in industrial applications was restricted
by high synthesis cost and complicated synthesis process.33 In recent years, deep eutectic solvents (DESs),
generally formed by complexion of hydrogen-bond acceptors (HBAs) with
hydrogen-bond donors (HBDs),34−36 have emerged as potential solvents
in lignocellulosic biomass pretreatment due to its high efficiency
on the depolymerization of lignin, low cost, low viscosity, low vapor
pressure, biocompatibility, and environmental friendliness, gaining
great attention from academic and industrial fields.37−43 Most of the reported studies on DESs for lignocellulosic biomass
pretreatment focus on choline chloride (ChCl) as an HBA, mainly due
to the fact that ChCl can be mixed with various HBDs, such as amino
acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, carboxylic acid, and
alcohol, to prepare DESs with certain solubility to lignin.44−47 However, ChCl belongs to a non-aromatic ring quaternary ammonium
salt, and its phase transfer catalytic ability is not as good as an
aromatic ring quaternary ammonium salt, which makes the solubility
of lignin in these DESs limited. There are few DESs reported that
utilize aromatic ring quaternary alkyl ammonium salts;14 however, their application to WS pretreatment
is not well reported.

It is therefore the objective of the present
study to test triethylbenzyl
ammonium chloride (TEBAC)/lactic acid (LA)-based DESs for the pretreatment
of WS. The lignin removal, xylan loss, and the cellulose reservation
from WS by TEBAC/LA-based DESs were systematically investigated. The
effects of different pretreatment times (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h),
reaction temperatures (353, 363, 373, and 383 K), and TEBAC/LA molar
ratios (1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 1:11, and 1:13) on lignin removal from WS were
systematically investigated. Moreover, the cellulose-enriched residues
were systemically investigated for the enzymatic saccharification
to produce sugars. Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometry, X-ray diffraction
(XRD), and 1H–13C two-dimensional heteronuclear
single quantum correlation (2D-HSQC) NMR spectroscopy were used to
characterize the cellulose-enriched residues and extracted lignin.
Overall, a systematic understanding of this pretreatment process will
be beneficial for separation and valorization of three biomass components
(cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin) from WS in future large-scale
biorefinery.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Effect of Pretreatment Conditions on the Enzymatic
Hydrolysis
2.1.1 Pretreatment Time
The effects of
different pretreatment times on the WS pretreated by a TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based
DES and enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency of cellulose-enriched residues
were investigated at various pretreatment times of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
and 12 h. The ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15, and the pretreatment
temperature was kept at 373 K. The recovery of cellulose-enriched
residues and the compositions of cellulose, xylan, and lignin are
displayed in Figure 1A. It can be observed from Figure 1A that the recovery rate of the cellulose-enriched
residues gradually decreases with the increase in the pretreatment
time, reducing from 100% (untreated WS) to 48.7 ± 2.54% at a
pretreatment time of 12 h. Figure 1B presents the related parameters in terms of lignin
removal, xylan loss, and cellulose maintenance. Clearly, as the treated
reaction time prolonged, the removal rate of lignin gradually increased
from 48.76 ± 1.12% (2 h) to 73.71 ± 1.19% (12 h). Meanwhile,
the rate of xylan loss gradually increased from 43.44 ± 1.61%
(2 h) to 78.37 ± 1.98% (12 h). However, the cellulose reservation
was slightly reduced from 83.14 ± 2.58% (2 h) to 76.23 ±
1.32% (12 h). Furthermore, the effect of pretreatment time on the
cellulose-enriched residues enzymatic hydrolysis after TEBAC/LA-based
DES pretreatment is listed in Table 1. It can be seen from Table 1 that the untreated WS presented low cellulose
and xylan digestibilities of 25.82 ± 0.94 and 9.69 ± 1.08%,
respectively. This is mainly due to the presence of the lignin polymer
and coating effect of xylan in the cell wall, which severely hindered
enzymatic hydrolysis.48 In contrast, the cellulose and xylan
digestibilities of cellulose-enriched residues after TEBAC/LA-based
DES pretreatment (10 h) were dramatically improved to 89.06 ±
1.05 and 71.00 ± 1.03%, respectively, which are 3.45- and 7.33-fold
higher than that of untreated WS. As we all know, shorter pretreatment
time usually leads to higher production efficiency in industrialized
production; therefore, it is preferable to select the pretreatment
reaction time to 10 h, and the highest yields of glucose and xylose
reached 66.32 ± 1.58 and 20.09 ± 1.39%, respectively.

ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15, and the pretreatment temperature

a The molar ratio
of TEBAC/LA was
1:9, the ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15, and the pretreatment temperature
was kept at 373 K.

2.1.2 Pretreatment Temperature
Figure 2 displays the effect
of pretreatment temperature ranging from 353 to 383 K on the WS pretreated
by a TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES and enzymatic hydrolysis efficiency
of cellulose-enriched residues. The ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15,
and the pretreatment time was 10 h. It can be observed clearly from Figure 2A that, with the
reaction temperature ranging from 353 to 383 K, the recovery rate
of cellulose-enriched residues correspondingly decreased from 67.45
± 3.34% (353 K) to 45.76 ± 2.58% (383 K), while the cellulose
content increased gradually from 45.02 ± 2.70 to 60.39 ±
3.60%, and the xylan content decreased from 18.87 ± 0.64 to 9.19
± 1.02% as the pretreatment temperature increase from 353 to
383 K. This may be due to the increase in temperature, which is beneficial
to not only the removal of lignin but also the removal of xylan. Besides,
as the temperature increased, the lignin content in the residue after
DES pretreatment was decreased from 18.12 ± 0.60 to 6.10 ±
0.58%, and the lignin removal rate also significantly increased from
51.27 ± 1.76 to 84.00 ± 1.03% (see Figure 2B), indicating that the high temperature
could promote the DES to break the chemical bond between lignin, cellulose,
and xylan and result in the removal of lignin.49

the ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15, and the pretreatment time was
10 h. (A) Recovery of residues and the composition of cellulose, xylan,
and lignin. (B) Lignin removal, xylan loss, and cellulose reservation.

The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose-enriched
residues at different
pretreatment temperatures is listed in Table 2. By comparison, it can be found that the
enzymatic digestion rate of cellulose and xylan can be greatly improved
after DES treatment. Among them, the cellulose digestibility sharply
increased to 91.23 ± 2.19% (pretreated at 383 K) and was approximately
3.53-fold higher than the untreated WS. The digestibility of xylan
was also increased from 9.69 ± 0.58% (untreated WS) to 77.59
± 2.18% (pretreated at 383 K). This phenomenon may be due to
the increase in temperature, which facilitates the removal of lignin
and xylan, thereby increasing the accessibility of the enzyme and
accelerating the enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose.37,50 However, when the pretreatment temperature was 373 K, the cellulose
digestibility reached 89.06 ± 1.05%, and when the pretreatment
reaction temperature rises to 383 K, the cellulose conversion rate
was 91.23 ± 2.19%, which only increased slightly by around 2.44%.
Although higher cellulose and xylan digestibility were achieved at
a high reaction temperature, the recovery rate of cellulose-enriched
residues was low under the high temperature. The total sugar yield
depended on the residue recovery and polysaccharide digestibility.
Furthermore, considering that a high temperature requires larger energy
consumption, the optimal pretreatment reaction temperature for WS
was selected as 373 K. A total monosaccharide yield of 0.550 g/g WS
(0.471 g of glucose and 0.079 g of xylose) was achieved, which is
91.27% of the theoretical yield (0.603 g/g).

a The molar ratio
of TEBAC/LA was
1:9, the ratio of solid to liquid was 1:15, and the pretreatment time
was 10 h.

2.1.3 Molar Ratio
The effect of different
molar ratios of TEBAC/LA-based DESs on the WS pretreatment is presented
in Figure 3. The pretreatment
reaction temperature was kept at 373 K, the reaction time was 10 h,
and the solid–liquid ratio is 1:15. It could be seen from Figure 3A that the recovery
rate of residues decreases first and then increases as the amount
of LA molar increases, which was due to the fact that the different
molar ratios of TEBAC/LA have various pretreatment effects on the
WS. Furthermore, the differences in cellulose and xylan contents obtained
by different molar ratios of TEBAC/LA were also obvious. It is worth
noting that the lowest cellulose reservation (77.79 ± 0.70%)
was obtained using the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES. This may be attributed
to the better removal of lignin (73.96 ± 1.26%; see Figure 3B) from this type
of DES, resulting in more cellulose exposure and loss. It also can
be seen from Table 3 that after TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES pretreatment, the enzymatic
digestion rate could be significantly increased, and the digestibility
of cellulose was improved from 25.82 ± 0.94% (untreated WS) to
89.06 ± 1.05%, increasing by 3.45-fold, which was higher than
the pretreatment by a TEBAC/LA (1:7)-based DES (77.27 ± 1.37%).
With no doubt, a high glucose yield (66.32 ± 1.58%) was achieved
with more lignin removal. Based on the abovementioned results, the
1:9 molar ratio of TEBAC/LA was selected for the optimum ratio.

temperature was kept at 373 K, and the pretreatment time was 10 h.

a The ratio of solid to liquid was
1:15, the pretreatment temperature was kept at 373 K, and the pretreatment
time was 10 h.

2.1.4 Comparison of Different Methods for WS Pretreatment
Compared to the chloride (ChCl)/LA (1:2)-based DES treatment of
WS,46 low temperature and shorter time
and a similar lignin removal can be obtained by using the TEBAC/LA
(1:9)-based DES in the current study. For example, 73.96 ± 1.26%
of lignin can be removed from WS after the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES
treatment at 373 K for 10 h, whereas ChCl/LA (1:2) pretreatment of
WS at 393 K for 12 h led to 78.6 ± 0.7% lignin removal. This
is mainly because TEBAC is an aromatic ring quaternary ammonium salt
with strong phase transfer ability, which can dissolve in both water
and organic phases. The positive and negative ions in the quaternary
ammonium salt form an ion pair in the water phase, which can transfer
negative ions from the water phase to the organic phase, while in
the organic phase, negative ions have no solventization role. Furthermore,
because the positive ions are large, the distance between the positive
and negative ions is also large, and the role between each other is
weak. Also, negative ions can be regarded as bare, so the reaction
activity is greatly improved. Furthermore, compared to the TEBAC/LA
(1:9)-based DES pretreatment of corncobs, the sugar yield was increased
to 94.0% under optimal conditions at 413 K for 2 h.14 The main reason is that the fiber cell wall ultrastructure,
vascular tissue structure, and lignin characteristics between corncobs
and WS are different.46

2.2 Characterization of Solid Fraction
2.2.1 Scanning
Electron Microscopy
Figure S1 displays
the morphologies of the untreated
and pretreated WS with the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES samples as characterized
by SEM. As shown in Figure S1A,B, the surface
of untreated WS is smooth without obvious damage. However, some wrinkles
and holes appeared on the surface of the pretreated WS after TEBAC/LA
(1:9)-based DES pretreatment (see Figure S1C,D). This is due to the fact that DESs removed the lignin and hemicellulose
that wrapped and exposed the cellulose.33 The loose structure of pretreated WS is conducive to penetration
and hydrolysis by enzymes, thus providing favorable conditions for
the enzymatic treatment of cellulose in the later stage and significantly
improves the enzyme digestion efficiency. Furthermore, the surface
of obtained solid residues is not as smooth as expected because the
residues after pretreatment by DES still contain some non-fiber components.

2.2.2 FT-IR Spectra
The FT-IR spectra
of untreated WS and pretreated WS using the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES
are presented in Figure S2. The absorption
peaks at 3396 cm–1 denote O–H stretching
vibration, and the absorption peaks at 2924 cm–1 represent C–H stretching vibration, while the absorption
bands at 1727 cm–1 are the stretching vibration
peaks of C=O, which are the characteristic absorption peak
of xylan. The peaks at 1631 cm–1 are the skeleton
vibration of lignin benzene ring with weak C=O vibration, and
those at 1511 cm–1 are the skeleton vibration of
aromatic ring.32 The absorption peaks at
1380 cm–1 are the C–O or OH bending vibration
of lignin benzene ring, and the absorption bands at 1233 cm–1 denote the ether linkages between hemicellulose and lignin.33 The absorption bands at 1066 cm–1 are the C–O stretching vibration on C–O–C,
and those at 890 cm–1 are a β-(1,4) glycosidic
bond.14 Clearly, comparing with untreated
WS, the characteristic absorption peaks of 1511, 1380, and 1233 cm–1 were weakened or even disappeared in the DES pretreated
WS, indicating that the lignin and hemicellulose were depolymerized
during the pretreatment. Furthermore, the absorption bands at 1066
cm–1 after pretreatment using TEBAC/LA were stronger
than untreated WS, demonstrating that the cellulose was not damaged.

2.2.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD) Analysis of WS
XRD analyses of the WS before and after pretreatment by different
DESs were performed to monitor the changes in the crystal structure. Figure S3 shows the X-ray diffraction spectra
of WS before and after pretreatment using the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based
DES. The crystallization index (CrI) was calculated using the following
equation51,52 1  where I002 is the maximum diffraction
peak intensity of the 002 crystal
plane (2θ ≈ 22.5°) and Iam is the intensity of the amorphous cellulose, hemicellulose, and
lignin at 2θ ≈ 18.2°.

Obviously, the crystalline
structure is classified as cellulose I crystal type as suggested by
the peaks at 16.2° (110 planes), 21.8° (200 planes), and
34.8° (004 planes). Moreover, the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES pretreated
WS did not undergo the change in the cellulose I crystal form, suggesting
that the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES used in the present work does not
disrupt the crystal structure of WS. The crystallinity of WS after
pretreatment by the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES (47.27%) is higher than
that of untreated WS (38.17%), indicating the amorphous components
in terms of partial cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin removal.53,54 Furthermore, more xylan and lignin removal results in higher CrI
values, which is similar to the results reported by other researchers.33,55

2.3 Regenerated Lignin Structural Characterization
2.3.1 2D-HSQC NMR Analysis
The 2D-HSQC
NMR spectroscopy analysis was carried out to demonstrate the structural
characteristics of regenerated lignin and is shown in Figure 4. Generally, the 2D-HSQC NMR
spectroscopy could be divided into three regions of 13C–1H correlation corresponding to aliphatic (about δC/δH 0–50/0–2.5 ppm), oxygenated
aliphatic (approximately δC/δH 50–100/2.5–6.5
ppm), and aromatic (around δC/δH 100–160/5.5–9.0 ppm) regions.56 In the oxygenated aliphatic region of 2D-HSQC NMR spectra, the relative
abundances of interunit linkages were estimated from intensities of
CR–HR, while lignin acylation was estimated
from Cγ–Hγ correlations in
acylated and nonacylated side chains.57,58 In the aromatic
region, the C2,6–H2,6 correlations from
S units and the sum of C2–H2 and C6–H6 correlations from G units were used
to estimate the S/G ratio.57,58 The main interunit linkages of ether or the C–C bond are
displayed in Figure 5, and their proportions were estimated and are listed in Table 4. Clearly, it can
be seen from Figure 5 that the δC/δH = 52.55/3.13 denotes
the Cβ–Hβ in β-β′
resinol structures, δC/δH = 55.33/3.46
is the β–5′ in phenylcoumaran substructures, δC/δH = 56.55/3.78 is the C–H in −OCH3 structures, and δC/δH =
66.76/3.87 and 4.19 represents the Cγ–Hγ in β-β′ resinol structures. Interestingly,
the structural signal peak of Hibbert ketone (HK) appeared at δC/δH = 69.22/4.93, while there is no Cβ–Hβ signal in the β-O-4′ structure in the side-chain regions, which may
be because TEBAC/LA breaks the β-O-4′
bond in the lignin structure and leads to no signal or weak signal
here. Furthermore, the β-O-4′ bond breaks
lead to the formation of the HK structure, suggesting that the connection
structure between lignin extracted from DES is mainly the C–C
bond. This is consistent with the similar results of the β-O-4′ fracture in the DES-extracted lignin reported
by a previous study.59 Noticeably, in aromatic
(approximately δC/δH 100–160/5.5–9.0
ppm) regions, the signal peaks of the syringyl units (S), guaiacyl
units (G), and p-hydroxybenzene (H) units can be
detected. It shows that these three basic units exist in the lignin
structure. Among them, the signal peaks of the syringyl units (S)
and the guaiacyl units (G) are relatively strong, indicating that
the extracted lignin is mainly composed of the syringyl units (S)
and the guaiacyl units (G).

2.3.2 FT-IR Analysis
Furthermore, Figure S4 shows the FT-IR
spectra of regenerated
lignin extracted by the TEBAC/LA-based DES. It can be found that these
typical lignin characteristic peaks of 1600, 1511, 1456, and 1427
cm–1 exist in the regenerated lignin extracted by
the TEBAC/LA-based DES. Among them, 1600 cm–1 is
lignin aromatic ring vibration accompanied by weak C=O vibration,
1511 cm–1 is aromatic ring skeleton vibration, 1456
cm–1 is C–H asymmetric deformation signal
peak, and 1427 cm–1 is aromatic ring skeleton vibration
surface. Other peaks were due to the aromatic ring breathing of syringyl
units (1300 cm–1) and syringyl units (1265 cm–1) and out-of-plane C–H bending of syringyl
units (835 cm–1), from which it can be inferred
that the extracted lignin structure is dominated by the syringyl units
(S) and the guaiacyl units (G) structures.60

3 Conclusions
The
present study comprehensively demonstrated the effects of pretreatment
time, temperature, and molar ratio of TEBAC/LA on enhanced enzymatic
digestibility and lignin valorization. The total sugar concentration
was significantly increased to 0.550 g/g WS (0.471 g of glucose and
0.079 g of xylose) under optimal pretreatment conditions with the
TEBAC/LA (1:9) system at 373 K for 10 h, which reached 91.27% of the
theoretical yield (0.603 g/g). Furthermore, the regenerated lignin
(75.69 ± 1.32% purity) was mainly composed of the syringyl units
and the guaiacyl units. Thus, the TEBAC/LA (1:9)-based DES provides
a promising pretreatment method for selective delignification of WS
to enhance enzymatic hydrolysis.

4 Experimental
Section
4.1 Materials
The WS milled using a lapping
machine and sieved to 60 meshes was collected from Lianyungang (Jiangsu
Province, China). Before use, the WS was washed with deionized water
and dried to constant weight at 105 °C. The composition of WS
was 34.94 ± 1.2% of cellulose, 18.87 ± 0.64% of xylan, and
18.12 ± 0.6% of lignin in terms of dry weight. Triethylbenzyl
ammonium chloride (TEBAC; 98%) and lactic acid (LA; AR, ≥85%
purity) were purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical Co., Ltd.
All chemicals were used without any further purification.

4.2 Preparation of DES Mixtures
TEBAC
and LA were mixed at specific molar ratios of 1:5, 1:7, 1:9, 1:11,
and 1:13. The solutions were added into the three-neck bottles and
stirred at 80 °C for 1 h until a homogeneous colorless liquid
was obtained. Then, the prepared DESs were stored in a desiccator
before use.

4.3 General Process for Pretreatment
of WS Using
DESs
Figure 6 displays a general flow diagram of the WS pretreatment process using
the TEBAC/LA-based DES. Typically, the WS pretreatment was carried
out in a three-neck bottle with 2.0 g of WS and 30.0 g of DES. Then,
the three-neck bottle was placed in a constant temperature oil bath
and reacted at different temperatures (353, 363, 373, and 383 K) for
a certain time (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h) at an agitation speed of
200 rpm. After the reaction, the mixtures were cooled to room temperature,
washed with anhydrous ethanol, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 5 min,
and then transferred the sediment from the lower layer to the vacuum
drying chamber to dry the residue. Ethanol was recovered by rotary
evaporation from the upper liquid at 323 K to remove the ethanol.
Deionized water was added to the concentrated liquid about three times.
After a period, the stratified mixture was centrifuged under 10,000
rpm for 5 min. The sediment was washed repeatedly with deionized water,
and regenerated lignin was obtained after drying. The upper liquid
was removed by rotary evaporation to recover DESs. After the pretreatment
step, recovered WS was characterized with regard to its composition,
crystallinity, and enzymatic digestibility.

of wheat straw.

The residue recovery (R%) of WS was calculated
by the following equation 2  where mR and MWS represent
the masses
of the residue and raw WS (g), respectively.

The lignin removal
(RL%), xylan loss
(LXyl%), and cellulose reservation (RC%) of WS are measured based on the content
of each component in residues, as displayed in the following equations 3   4   5  where mRL, mRXyl, and mRC are the masses of lignin, xylan, and cellulose in the
residues (g), respectively. MWSL, MWSXyl, and MWSC are
the masses of lignin, xylan, and cellulose in the WS (g), respectively.

The purity of lignin (PL%) in the isolated
lignin was calculated as follows 6  where mrL is the mass of lignin in regenerated products
(g). Mr is the mass of regenerated products
(g).

4.4 Characterization of Solid Fraction
The morphological analysis of solid fraction coated with gold was
observed using a scanning electron microscope (SU70, Japan). FT-IR
spectroscopy was determined by a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer (Thermo
Fisher Scientific, Germany) using potassium bromide method. Each spectrum
was collected from 4000 to 400 cm–1 with a resolution
of 4 cm–1. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was confirmed
on a Panalytical X’pert Pro diffractometer with Cu Kα
irradiation (40 kV and 40 mA) and zero background. Each diffraction
pattern was collected in the angles (2θ) from 5° to 50°
using a rotation speed of 80 rpm.

1H–13C two-dimensional heteronuclear single quantum correlation
(2D-HSQC) NMR spectroscopy of regenerated lignin was conducted on
an AVANCE III HD 400 MHz spectrometer and recorded in the gradient
HSQC adiabatic version. The sample was dissolved with 80 mg of regenerated
lignin in 0.75 mL of deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d6). The spectral widths of 1H and 13C were 8333
and 22,347 Hz, respectively. The number of collected complex points
was 1024 for the 1H dimension with a recycle delay of 1.5
s, the number of transients was 128, and 256 time increments were
recorded in the 13C dimension.

4.5 Enzymatic
Hydrolysis Saccharification
Enzymatic hydrolysis saccharification
was carried out in an Erlenmeyer
flask (50 mL) containing 0.4 g of the WS samples (pretreated or untreated)
and 20 mL of 50 mM citrate buffer (pH 4.8). The dosage of cellulase
(cellulase 1.5 L, Novozymes) and β-glucosidase (AMG300L, Novozymes)
used were 35 filter paper units (FPU)/g biomass and 82 CBU/g biomass,
respectively. The reaction was performed in a constant temperature
incubator shaker (ZQZY-80BS, Shanghai Zhichu Instrument Co., Ltd.,
Shanghai, China) with a speed of 200 rpm at 323 K. Then, 1.00 mL of
supernatants was withdrawn and terminated after inactivation in boiling
water for 5 min at a time of 60 h. The supernatant was then centrifuged
(10,000 rpm for 5 min) and diluted twice by the mobile phase and then
filtered by a 0.22 μm membrane to measure the concentrations
of sugars using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The
digestibilities of cellulose and xylan were calculated as follows 7   8  where Cglucose, Ccellobiose, and Cxylan are the concentrations of
glucose cellobiose
and xylose in enzymatic hydrolysis system (g/L), respectively. 20/19
is the multiplication factor that converts cellobiose to equivalent
glucose. Csubstrate is the substrate loading
(g/L), and Cellulose_content and Xylan_content are the content of
cellulose and xylan in the substrate (g), respectively. Values 0.90
and 0.88 represent the conversion factors used to convert cellulose
and xylan into glucose and xylose, respectively.

The yields
of glucose and xylose were calculated using the following equations 9   10  where MHydrolysis-glucose and MHydrolysis-xylose are the mass of glucose
and xylose released from enzymatic hydrolysis
residues (g), respectively. MWS-glucose and MWS-xylose are the theoretical
mass of glucose and xylose in untreated WS (g), respectively.

4.6 Analysis Method
The cellulose, xylan,
and lignin contents of the untreated and pretreated WS were determined
using the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) analytical method.61 All the experiments were carried out in duplicate
to show the reproducibility of the experiments. The concentrations
of sugar were determined by HPLC (Waters 2685 systems, Waters Corp.,
USA) using an Aminex HPX-87H anion exchange column (300 mm ×
7.8 mm, Bio-Rad Corp., USA) equipped with a refractive index detector
(Waters 2414). The column temperature was maintained at 328 K, and
the flow rate of the mobile phase (5 mM sulfuric acid) was 0.5 mL/min.62 The quantity of the sample was 10 μL.
External standards were established for calibration.
