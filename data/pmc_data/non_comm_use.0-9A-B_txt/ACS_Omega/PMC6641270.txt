By the introduction of −OH
group(s) into different position(s)
of 6-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine, several NNN-type
ligands were synthesized and then introduced to ruthenium (Ru) centers
by reactions with RuCl2(PPh3)3. In
the presence of PPh3 or CO, these ruthenium complexes reacted
with NH4PF6 in CH2Cl2 or
CH3OH to give a series of ionic products 5–9. The reaction of Ru(L2)(PPh3)Cl2 (2) with CO generated a neutral complex [Ru(L2)(CO)Cl2] (10). In the presence of CH3ONa, 10 was further converted into complex [Ru(L2)(HOCH3)(CO)Cl] (11), in which there
was a methanol molecule coordinating with ruthenium, as suggested
by density functional theory calculations. The catalytic transfer
hydrogenation activity of all of these new bifunctional metal–ligand
complexes was tested. Dichloride complex 2 exhibits best
activity, whereas carbonyl complexes 10 and 11 are efficient for selectively reducing 5-hexen-2-one, suggesting
different hydrogenation mechanisms. The results reveal the dramatic
influence for the reactivity and catalytic activity of the secondary
coordination sphere in transition metal complexes.

Introduction
Metal–ligand
cooperation has been receiving more and more
attention in recent years.1−13 One of the strategies to design metal–ligand cooperative
catalysts is to introduce a 2-hydroxypyridyl moiety into the metal
center.14−33 In the presence of a base, 2-hydroxypyridyl could be deprotonated
to a pyridonate form with a C=O bond, which directly affects
the first coordination sphere of the metal center.14,15 For example, Fujita, Yamaguchi, and co-workers developed a series
of iridium complexes bearing bidentate 2-hydroxypyridyl derivatives
for dehydrogenative oxidation of alcohols,16−19 dehydrogenation of fused bicyclic
N-heterocycles,20 dehydrogenative lactonization
of diols,21 and hydrogen production from
methanol–water solution.22 Himeda,
Fujita, and co-workers utilized a bimetallic tetrahydroxybipyrimidine–iridium
complex for the hydrogenation of CO2 to formate in aqueous
solution under mild conditions.25

2-Hydroxypyridyl ligand was also found in [Fe]-hydrogenase. In
its active site, Fe is coordinated with a special bidentate 2-hydroxy-6-acylmethylenepyridyl
(2-HO-6-CH2COC5H3N) derivative (Figure 1a).34−41 Both experimental and computational studies have indicated the essential
role of the 2-hydroxy group.42−51 Recently, Szymczak et al. have developed a tridentate ruthenium
catalyst bearing 6,6′-dihydroxy terpyridine (dhtp) as the ligand
for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones (Figure 1b), and both of its activity and selectivity
are better than similar ruthenium complexes incorporating 4,4′-dihydroxy
terpyridine or terpyridine as the ligand.52,53 The results confirmed the importance of the 2-hydroxy group in the
system.53 Kundu’s group then synthesized
another similar ruthenium complex based on the ligand of 2-(2-pyridyl-2-ol)-1,10-phenanthroline
(Figure 1c), showing
a final time-of-flight (TOF) of 2.40 × 103 h–1 for the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone.54

complex; (c) Kundu’s ruthenium complex; and (d) ruthenium complex.

Inspired by the structure of [Fe]-hydrogenase
and Szymczak’s
work, we have also synthesized several ruthenium catalysts with high
activity for the transfer hydrogenation of ketones based on the ligand
of 6-(2,2′-bipyridin-6-ylmethyl)pyridin-2-ol (L1) (Figure 2), which is more similar to the [Fe]-hydrogenase active
site than dhtp.55 For example, complex
Ru(L1)(PPh3)Cl2 (1)
(Figure 1d) exhibits
a final TOF of 1.16 × 103 h–1 for
the transfer hydrogenation of acetophenone.55 Because of the dramatic catalytic influence of the secondary coordination
sphere in Szymczak’s systems,52−54,56,57 as an extension of our previous
work, we designed a series of new ligands (L2–L4) by
modification of L1 and introduced
them to ruthenium centers (Figure 2).

Figure 2 Designed ligands in this paper.

Herein, we report the synthesis, reactivity, and catalytic
activity
for ketone transfer hydrogenation of these ruthenium complexes supported
by L1–L4.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Complexes 2–6
When
6′-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridin-6-ol (L2) and 6′-((6-hydroxypyridin-2-yl)methyl)-2,2′-bipyridin-6-ol
(L3) were treated with RuCl2(PPh3)3 in refluxing methanol, complexes
Ru(L2)(PPh3)Cl2 (2) and Ru(L3)(PPh3)Cl2 (3) were obtained,
respectively (Scheme 1). The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectrum
of 2 in CD3OD shows two doublets for the −CH2– group at 4.10 and 3.57 ppm, indicating that the two
protons are in different environments, which means the two Cl atoms
linking with Ru are cis to each other. The phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic
resonance (31P NMR) spectrum of 2 shows one
singlet for the PPh3 group at 56.5 ppm, comparable to that
of 1.55 Both the 1H NMR and 31P NMR spectra of 3 are similar
to those of 2.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Complexes 2 and 3
By using similar procedures as described above, no reactivity
was
found between 6,6′-(pyridine-2,6-diylbis(methylene))dipyridin-2-ol
(L4) and RuCl2(PPh3)3. It might be due to the lower coordination ability
of L4 caused by its high flexibility.
Under a harsher condition, L4 reacted with RuCl2(PPh3)3 in methanol
to give the product [(O–C5H3N–CH2–C5H3N–CH2–C5H4N–O)Ru2(CO)4(PPh3) (4) via deprotonations (Scheme 2). The infrared (IR) spectrum of 4 exhibits four strong CO absorptions, suggesting different structures
from 1–3. From the X-ray single-crystal structure,
we can see that 4 is a dinuclear ruthenium complex (Figure 3). One Ru atom coordinates
with three pyridyl rings and two cis-CO groups, the other links with
two cis-CO, one PPh3, and two O atoms, and the two Ru atoms
are linked by a Ru–Ru bond. Different from 1–3, the three pyridyl groups in 4 are in facial configuration,
and there is no O–H bond existing any more. The four CO ligands
must be from the dehydrogenation of methanol.58

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Complex 4
Complexes 2 and 3 were further treated
with NH4PF6 in the presence of PPh3, and the products [Ru(L2)(PPh3)2Cl][PF6] (5) and [Ru(L3)(PPh3)2Cl][PF6] (6) were obtained (Scheme 3). 6 was not obtained in a pure
form because there was always some unidentified impurities. When treated
with excess of HCl, complexes 2 and 3 could
be re-formed (Scheme 3). A similar transformation has been reported in our previous work.55

Scheme 3 Synthesis of Complexes 5 and 6
Catalysis
We investigated
the catalytic activity of 2–5 for ketone transfer
hydrogenation reactions. Acetophenone
was chosen as the substrate, and iPrOH
was chosen as the solvent (Table 1). The reactions were performed with a molar ratio
of 200/10/1 for acetophenone/base/catalyst under N2. From
entries 2–5, we can see that complex 2 is the
most active catalyst in the presence of iPrOK, giving a 96% yield within 15 min. However, compared with 1, complex 2 still shows a little lower efficiency
(entry 1). When NaOH, KOH, or tBuOK was
chosen as the base, complex 2 also exhibited high activity
(84–92%), although the results were not as good as iPrOK (entries 6–8). If the reaction was carried
out under air, the yield decreased to 13% (entry 9). Without a catalyst
or base, no transformation was found (entries 10 and 11). It should
be noticed that in the presence of 2, a trace of base
could make the reaction occur; therefore, the reaction bottles must
be cleaned completely to prevent base contamination.

d Reaction was carried out under air.

On the basis of the above results, iPrOK and complex 2 were chosen
as the base and the catalyst,
respectively, and a variety of ketones were applied as substrates
for transfer hydrogenation reactions (Table 2). To guarantee the yields achieved were
90% or above (except entries 15 and 21 because of the relatively slow
rates), the reaction times were optimized, and from GC results, it
can be seen that no other products were formed besides the corresponding
alcohols. For aryl ketones, the yields reached 89–96% within
15–180 min, with TOF values up to 768 h–1 (Table 2, entries
1–15). 1-Phenylethanol was obtained in 96% yield within 15
min through the reduction of acetophenone (TOF: 768 h–1; Table 2, entry 1).
Halogen atoms and the ortho-methyl group in the phenyl ring did not
influence the reaction rates obviously (TOF: 437–744 h–1; Table 2, entries 2–10), whereas para-methoxy and para-amino groups
decreased the reactivity remarkably (TOF: 37–61 h–1; Table 2, entries
13 and 14). It should be noticed that a meta-methyl group decreased
the reactivity obviously (TOF: 128 h–1; Table 2, entry 11), which
is consistent with the reported results.59−62 Benzophenone and 2-acetonaphthone
reacted smoothly to give the desired product in 89–91% yields
within 120 min (Table 2, entries 15 and 16). Aliphatic ketones, such as cyclohexanone, cyclopentanone,
2-heptanone, and 3-pentanone, showed moderate reactivity (TOF: 182–576
h–1; Table 2, entries 17–20).

d Yield of 5-hexen-2-ol. Note that
other products were observed, see text.

Two unsaturated aliphatic ketones, including 5-hexen-2-one
and
6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, were also tested. For 5-hexen-2-one, both
of the C=O and C=C bonds could be hydrogenated, and
a mixture of 5-hexen-2-ol, 2-hexanone, and 2-hexanol was obtained,
with the ratio of 1:0.22:0.63 in high conversion (94%) over 360 min
(Table 2, entry 21).
The low selectivity is similar to that catalyzed by 1 and suggests that the reactions might also follow an inner-sphere
hydrogenation mechanism.55 Interestingly,
only the carbonyl group was hydrogenated when 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one
was used as the starting material, and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-ol was
obtained in 94% yield over 180 min (Table 2, entry 22). It means that the chemoselectivity
can be improved by the introduction of bulky groups into the terminal
alkenyl carbon atom.

Complexes 1–3 have
similar structures; however,
the catalytic activities of 1 and 2 are
different from that of 3 for transfer hydrogenation of
acetophenone (Table 1, entries 1–3). 1 shows a little higher efficiency
than 2, and both 1 and 2 are
much more active than 3. The results might be due to
electronic differences between the ligands under the reaction conditions.
To further understand the reasons, inspired by Szymczak’s work,53 we introduced the CO group into the Ru centers.
The ligand fields can be evaluated by comparing the CO absorption
bands in their infrared spectra.

Synthesis of CO Derivatives 7–11
When complexes 1–3 were treated with NH4PF6 in the presence of
1 atm of CO gas in CH3OH or CH2Cl2, products [Ru(L1)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6] (7), [Ru(L2)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6] (8), and [Ru(L3)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6] (9) were obtained (Scheme 4). The 1H NMR spectrum of 7 in d6-acetone shows two doublets
for the −CH2– group at 4.02 and 3.43 ppm.
The 31P NMR spectrum shows one singlet at 44.4 ppm for
the PPh3 group and one multiplet at −143.9 ppm for
the PF6– anion. The IR spectrum exhibits
a strong CO absorption at 1968 cm–1. From the NMR
and IR data, the molecular structure of 7 can be confirmed,
as shown in Scheme 4, which is similar to that of [Ru(dhtp)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6].538 and 9 have structures similar to that of 7, with CO absorptions
at 1950 and 1998 cm–1, respectively.

Scheme 4 Synthesis
of Complexes 7–9
Interestingly, in the absence of NH4PF6, 2 reacted with CO in CH2Cl2 generating
the complex [Ru(L2)(CO)Cl2] (10), through the replacement of PPh3 by CO (Scheme 5).
By contrast, 1 and 3 reacted with CO, generating
unidentified mixtures. The IR spectrum of 10 exhibits
one CO absorption at 1981 cm–1. The X-ray crystal
structure shows two cis chlorides in the solid state (Figure 4). The O(1)–Cl(2) distance
(2.909 Å) in 10 reveals strong hydrogen bonding
between the hydroxy group and Cl(2). The C(1)–O(1) distance
[1.327(7) Å] is in the range of the C–O single bond.

Scheme 5 Synthesis of Complexes 10 and 11
Complex 10 further
reacted with CH3ONa
to give product 11 (Scheme 5). The IR spectrum shows one CO absorption
at 1946 cm–1 in the solid state. The 1H NMR spectrum exhibits two doublets at 4.90 and 4.47 ppm for the
−CH2– group and one singlet at 3.33 ppm for
the methoxy group. The 13C NMR exhibits one signal at 197.2
ppm for the terminal carbonyl group and two signals at 48.5 and 46.4
ppm for the −CH2– and methoxy groups, respectively.
These data suggested that 11 was formed by replacing
one Cl in 10 with a methoxy group. Although the molecular
formula can be confirmed, the exact structure of 11 is
still unknown. The stabilities of three possible isomers have been
examined through density functional theory (DFT) calculations (further
computational details are provided in the Supporting Information). The relative energies are shown in Table 3. Complex 11 is
the most stable one, in which the hydroxyl proton moves to the oxygen
in the methoxy group and forms a methanol molecule.

The only structural difference among 7–9 is
the NNN ligands, and all of these ligands contain the 6-(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)-2,2′-bipyridine
fragment; hence, they are good models for exploring the relationship
between the ligand field strength and catalytic activity. In the catalytic
process, ligands L1–L3 should be deprotonated to anionic forms
in the first step; hence, the reactivity of 7–9 with the base was investigated. The reactions could be monitored
by IR spectroscopy. Upon treatment of 7 with 4 or 10
equiv of iPrOK in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
solution, the CO absorption shifted from 1968 to 1952 cm–1. The red-shifted phenomenon is attributed to enhanced electron density
at the metal center upon ligand deprotonation, leading to greater
donation into the CO π* orbitals. The decrease in νCO of 16 cm–1 is somewhat similar to that
observed for a monocarbonyl copper complex featuring a single 2-hydroxypyridine
group (Δν = −26 cm–1).63

Similarly, deprotonation of 8 shifted νCO from 1950 to 1926 cm–1 (Δν
= −24 cm–1). Surprisingly, when 9 was treated with excess of iPrOK (4
or 10 equiv), the bathochromic shift in the magnitude of the CO band
was only 24 cm–1 (from 1998 to 1974 cm–1), suggesting that only one of the two hydroxy groups was deprotonated.53 The shift data are much less than those observed
upon double deprotonation of [Ru(dhtp)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6] (Δν = −77 cm–1), indicating
that the introduction of a −CH2– group into
dhtp influences the reactivity dramatically, although the detailed
reason is still unclear.53

As described
by Szymczak and co-workers, an electron-rich ruthenium
hydride species would facilitate insertion into the ketone substrate;53 hence, we started to compare their CO absorptions.
The νCO data of the deprotonated 7–9 are 1952, 1926, and 1974 cm–1, revealing that
the ligand field of the deprotonated L3 is the weakest, which makes the metal center of the deprotonated 9 have the lowest electron density and donates the least electrons
into the CO π* orbitals. The results are consistent with the
findings that 3 shows the lowest catalytic activity among 1–3. However, if only electronic effects are regarded, 2 should have exhibited higher activity than 1. It suggests that for complexes 1–3, the hydroxy
position is also an important factor to influence the activity.

Catalysis
Complexes 7–11 were also
tested for the transfer hydrogenation reaction of acetophenone (Table 4). None of these complexes
were as active as 2. Under the same condition as entry
2 in Table 1, all yields
reached above 90% within 60 min except 9 that was used
as the catalyst (Table 4, entries 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). In 15 min, 7–9 provided 82, 130, and 70 turnovers (Table 4, entries 1, 3, and 5). The catalytic activity
is in the order of 8, 7, and 9, consistent with that of the ligand fields. The results suggest
that in the cases of 7–9, the electron densities
in the Ru centers might play a dominant role for their activities.
Probably with similar reasons, the reactivity of 8 with
the π-acidic auxiliary ligand is lower than that of 5 (Table 1, entry 5).53

As discussed above, complex 2 is not efficient for
selectively reducing 5-hexen-2-one (Table 2, entry 21). When 7–9 were applied for the same reaction, the reactivity was very low,
with less than 20% conversion in 4 h (Figure 5). Whereas unexpectedly, 10 and 11 are both efficient for this reaction, with above 90% conversion
in 5 h, yielding almost exclusively the carbonyl reduction product
(Figure 5). The chemoselectivity
data of 10 and 11 suggest that the reaction
mechanism might follow an outer-sphere hydrogenation pathway, which
is different from that of 2.52−54,64 Ruthenium complexes 1–9 all contain
PPh3 ligands, which might be dissociated during the catalytic
process, making their catalytic processes follow an outer-sphere hydrogenation
pathway. There is no PPh3 in 10 and 11 and that might be one of the reasons that they facilitate
the outer-sphere hydrogenation pathway. On the other hand, if methanol
is replaced by iPrOH in 11, the resulting complex could be regarded as the intermediate when 10 was used as the catalyst and that is why the efficiencies
of 10 and 11 were almost the same. Although
no intermediate has been identified, to understand the reaction mechanism
clearly, further experiments are needed.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have synthesized a series of ruthenium complexes
bearing NNN ligands with a 2-hydroxypyridyl fragment, and their catalytic
activity for transfer hydrogenation of ketones was studied. In the
presence of CO, the dichloride ruthenium(II) complexes 1–3 reacted with NH4PF6 in methanol or CH2Cl2 to give ionic products 7, 8, and 9. By comparing the νCO data of the deprotonated 7–9, it can be seen
that the ligand field strengths for the deprotonated forms are in
the order of L2, L1, and L3. The catalytic activity of 7–9 in the transfer
hydrogenation of ketones is consistent with the order of their ligand
fields, suggesting in these cases that the electron densities in the
Ru centers might play a dominant role for their activities. By contrast,
complex 2 shows better catalytic activity than 3, but it is not as active as 1, which means
that for complexes 1–3, the hydroxy position is
also important for the activity. In the absence of NH4PF6, the reaction of 2 with CO in CH2Cl2 gave a neutral product 10, which could
further react with CH3ONa to form 11. DFT
calculations suggest that there is a methanol molecule coordinating
with ruthenium in 11. Both 10 and 11 are efficient for selectively reducing 5-hexen-2-one to
5-hexen-2-ol, suggesting that the catalytic reactions might follow
an outer-sphere hydrogenation pathway, similar to that of [Ru(dhtp)(PPh3)(CO)Cl][PF6] developed by Szymczak’s group.53 In fact, if methanol is replaced by iPrOH in 11, the resulting complex could
be regarded as the intermediate when 10 was used as the
catalyst. The results in this document are important for developing
more active and chemoselective transfer hydrogenation catalysts.

Experimental
Section
Schlenk line techniques were employed for all manipulations
of
air- and moisture-sensitive compounds. All solvents were distilled
from appropriate drying agents under N2 before use. All
reagents were purchased from commercial sources. The 1H, 31P, and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 400 spectrometer. The 1H NMR chemical shifts were
referenced to the residual solvent as determined relative to Me4Si (δ = 0 ppm). The 31P{1H} chemical
shifts were reported in ppm relative to external 85% H3PO4. The 13C{1H} chemical shifts
were reported in ppm relative to the carbon resonance of CDCl3 (77.0 ppm) and d6-DMSO (39.43
ppm). Elemental analyses were performed on a PerkinElmer 240C analyzer.
Mass spectra were recorded on an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole
Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer, equipped with an electrospray
ionization (ESI) source. X-ray diffraction studies were carried out
in an Xcalibur E X-ray single-crystal diffractometer. Data collections
were performed using four-circle kappa diffractometers equipped with
charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors. Data were reduced and then

General Procedure for the Catalytic Transfer
Hydrogenation of
Ketones
The catalyst solution was prepared by dissolving
complex 2 (69.7 mg, 0.10 mmol) in 2-propanol (10.0 mL),
and the internal standard solution was prepared by dissolving dodecane
(340 mg, 2.0 mmol) in 2-propanol (10.0 mL). Under an N2 atmosphere, the mixture of ketone (2.0 mmol), 1.0 mL of the catalyst
solution (0.01 mmol), 1.0 mL of the internal standard solution (0.2
mmol), and 2-propanol (10.0 mL) was stirred at 82 °C for 10 min.
Then, 0.2 mL of a 0.5 M iPrOK (0.10 mmol)
solution in 2-propanol was introduced to initiate the reaction. At
the stated time, 0.1 mL of the reaction mixture was sampled and immediately
diluted with 0.5 mL of 2-propanol precooled to 0 °C for GC analysis.
After the reaction was completed, the reaction mixture was condensed
under reduced pressure and subjected to purification by flash silica
gel column chromatography to afford the corresponding alcohol product,
which was identified by comparison with the authentic sample through
NMR and GC analyses.
