The prevalence of hospital-acquired
infections (HAIs) caused by
multidrug-resistant bacteria is a growing public health concern worldwide.
Herein, a facile, easily scalable technique is reported to fabricate
white-light-activated bactericidal surfaces by incorporating zinc
oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles and crystal violet (CV) dye into poly(dimethylsiloxane).
The effect of ZnO concentration on photobactericidal activity of CV
is investigated, and we show that there is synergy between ZnO and
CV. These materials showed highly significant antibacterial activity
when tested against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli under white
light conditions. These surfaces have potential to be used in healthcare
environments to decrease the impact of HAIs.

1 Introduction
Hospital-acquired
infections (HAIs) are among the most serious
complications of hospital care associated with extended duration of
hospital stays, increased morbidity, and increased medical costs.
According to the U.S. Center of Disease Control and Prevention, about
1 in 25 hospital patients acquires at least 1 HAI, equivalent to 722 000
infections in the U.S. in 2011, and resulting in 75 000 deaths
during hospitalization.1 The treatment
of these infections costs to the U.S. government app. $35–$45
billion per year.2 In the U.K., 300 000
healthcare-associated infections occur each year and cost over £1
billion to the National Health Service (NHS). In healthcare facilities,
80% of infections are because of contaminated touch surfaces. Therefore,
new antimicrobial surfaces need to be developed to minimize the risk
of spreading bacteria.

A number of studies have reported novel
and efficient antimicrobial
surfaces including surfaces releasing microbicides,3,4 antibiotics,5,6 and quaternary ammonium salts7,8 and copper surfaces.9,10 Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been raised as a promising alternative
to current techniques.11 Antimicrobial
photodynamic therapy, a type of PDT, is based on the use of nontoxic
light-activated antimicrobial agents (LAAAs), known as photosensitizers,
that are irradiated by a light source with an appropriate wavelength.12 In this process, these agents produce reactive
oxygen species (ROS) that act on bacteria via multiple attack pathways
including the oxidative destruction of cellular membranes, intracellular
proteins, and DNA. Given the multiple targets of ROS, the emergence
of bacterial resistance is extremely unlikely.13−15

Zinc
oxide (ZnO) is an inexpensive, wide band gap (3.3 eV at room
temperature) semiconducting material that has excellent optical and
electronic properties, finding a wide range of applications from field
effect transistors to gas sensors and in dye-sensitized solar cells.16 Moreover, ZnO has the inherent advantage of
showing antibacterial activities against a broad range of Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacteria.17−19 The antibacterial activity of
ZnO has been well exploited under irradiation with light (UV or white
light) and in the absence of light.19−23 Similar to that of LAAAs, the proposed mechanism of its antibacterial activity is thought
to be via oxidative stress as a result of ROS production.24

Regarding surface application of LAAAs,
it has been previously
demonstrated that photosensitizers (e.g., crystal violet (CV) and
methylene blue) can be successfully encapsulated into a variety of
different polymers by a facile “swell–encapsulation–shrink”
technique25−27 and these polymers demonstrate efficacious photoactivated
antibacterial activity under irradiation with white light. Also, dye-immobilized
polymeric materials have demonstrated an enhanced photobactericidal
activity when incorporated with different nanoparticles (NPs) (e.g.,
silver and gold).26,28,29 Even though these materials show potent photobactericidal activity,
they include complex, labor-intensive, time-consuming synthesis of
NPs. Also, these NPs can be implemented only to soft materials such
as polymers and silicones by the swell–encapsulation–shrink
process.

In our previous work, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)/ZnO
NP composites
with 0.36 wt % ZnO were fabricated through a solvent-aided dispersion
process using chloroform as a solvent.30 Then, ZnO-incorporated polymer squares were coated with CV and these
samples induced the lethal photosensitization of Escherichia
coli within 4 h and Staphylococcus
aureus within 1 h under white light conditions (∼10 500
lux).30

In the present study, a similar,
but a simpler, more versatile
and scalable approach is reported for fabricating highly efficacious
white-light-activated self-sterilizing surfaces based on three components
ZnO NPs, CV, and PDMS to overcome the aforementioned problems. The
main objective of this study was to investigate whether the photobactericidal
activity of CV is influenced by the ZnO content. Also, we utilized
a lower white light intensity compared to that in the previous work
(∼6500 lux) in antimicrobial tests. The results showed that
the synergistic combination of CV and ZnO NPs led to superior antibacterial
activity of the polymers.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Materials Synthesis
CV and ZnO NPs
were incorporated into PDMS by a simple two-step procedure to fabricate
a potent bactericidal polymer–nanocomposite (Figure 1). The first step involved
mixing ∼60 nm ZnO NPs (see Supporting Information, Figure S2a) with PDMS by mechanical rabbling
on the basis of a series of PDMS/ZnO NPs with varying nanoparticle
content, as shown in Table 1. Then, the resultant milky polymer was degassed under vacuum
to remove entrapped air bubbles. Finally, the polymer was cast on
glass substrates and cured in a preheated oven at 100 °C. Whereas
PDMS is transparent, the ZnO-embedded polymers are white (Figure 2).

In the second step, these modified polymers
were coated with CV
using a swell–encapsulation–shrink method. In this process,
the polymer squares were dipped and left to swell in 750 ppm CV solutions
in acetone for 24 h under dark conditions. Acetone induced polymer
swelling, allowing dye penetration through the polymer matrix. After
removing from the solution, the swollen polymer had shrunk to its
original dimensions as the remaining solvent evaporated. This method
generated dark purple polymer squares, indicating an efficacious uptake
of the dye onto the polymer surfaces (Figure 2).

nanoparticle
contents (0.5–5.0 wt %): samples before (on the
top) and after (on the bottom) the swell–encapsulation–shrink
process.

2.2 Material
Characterization
Figure S3 shows
the infrared absorbance spectra
of the polymer films, from which no significant change was confirmed
across the ZnO/PDMs composite films from 0 to 5 wt % of ZnO nanoparticle
concentration before and after the swell–encapsulation–shrink
process. The similarity between the untreated and treated samples
can be due to the strong PDMS absorbance bands and the low concentrations
of dye present in the polymer samples. Consequently, the results indicate
that the incorporation of ZnO NPs and CV in the silicones had no significant
influence on the internal structures of the films within the detection
limit of Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR).

The presence of
the ZnO NPs was confirmed by X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence
(PL) spectroscopy, and functional testing of the polymer films. The
X-ray diffraction of neither the 0.5ZnO nor the 1.0ZnO sample displayed any discernible
reflection because of the low density of the ZnO NPs embedded within
the polymers, whereas phase-pure ZnO in the wurtzite crystal structure
was appeared when ZnO concentration increased to 5.0 wt % (Figure 3b) (peaks at 2θ
= 31.7, 34.4, 36.2, 47.6, and 56.5° assigned to (100), (002),
(101), (102), and (110) planes, respectively). Also, it can be seen
that the incorporation of CV into the polymer does not impact the
internal structure of the polymer film, in good agreement with the
experimental results of Figure S3.

Figure 3 XRD patterns
of (a) ZnO nanopowder and (b) PDMS, 5.0ZnO, and 5.0ZnO–CV.
The peaks were indexed to a polycrystalline wurtzite structure.

Photoluminescence measurements
were made on the PDMS-encapsulated
materials with and without CV coating (Figure 4). The ZnO-incorporated samples without CV
displayed a clear, broad fluorescence band, peaking at ca. 520 nm,
increasing in intensity with increasing ZnO loading. This is in agreement
with reported values for ZnO nanoparticles of this size and with a
powder sample of ZnO measured ex situ of the PDMS.31,32 On coating with CV, the ZnO emission band is overwhelmed by CV emission.

Figure 4 PL spectra
of (a) ZnO nanopowder and (b) ZnO/PDMS composites.

The treated PDMS samples were also characterized
using UV–vis
absorbance spectroscopy (Figure 5). The main and shoulder absorption peaks of PDMS containing
CV alone are at λ ≈ 590 and 533 nm, respectively. The
addition of ZnO NPs increased the maxima, intensity, and breadth of
the CV peak, indicating that dye uptake was enhanced by increasing
the ZnO concentration. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in another
study in which gold nanoparticles enhanced the UV–visible absorption
of toluidine blue.33 However, for 5.0ZnO–CV,
the absorption reached its maximum as expected because 5.0ZnO–CV
was darker in color compared with any other CV-coated sample. The
CV concentrations within the polymer were found to be 1.17 ×
10–4, 6.64 × 10–4, 8.50 ×
10–4, and 1.07 × 10–3 for
PDMS, 0.5Zn–CV, 1.0Zn–CV, and 5.0Zn–CV, respectively.

Figure 5 UV–visible
absorbance spectra for (a) CV, (b) 0.5ZnO–CV,
and (c) 1.0ZnO–CV.

Moreover, a characteristic absorption peak at 375 nm for
ZnO NPs
suspended in water was seen in the range of UV (see Supporting Information, Figure S2b), indicating that ZnO NPs are UV-activated
photocatalysts (<385 nm) and hence should not show significant
antibacterial activity under white light conditions. However, when
encapsulated in PDMS, there was no characteristic UV–vis peak
of ZnO because of high nanoparticle concentrations.

Wetting
properties of the samples were characterized by contact
angle (CA) measurements using water as a test liquid. As demonstrated
in Table 1, bare PDMS
is inherently hydrophobic having a CA of 97.0 ± 1.8°, whereas
no significant difference in the wetting properties of the treated
samples was observed, varying in contact angle by ±6°.

To examine whether there was leaching of the dye-incorporated polymers,
they were placed in 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution
at 37 °C and the CV leachates were measured spectroscopically
as a function of time (Figure 6). It can be seen that all of the CV-coated samples leached
dye into PBS after 24 h and that the amount of CV leaching was correlated
with increasing the nanoparticle weight. Over a period of more than
300 h, the CV concentration of all of the samples plateaus at below
8.5 × 10–7 M and, overall, no further leaching
was observed, indicating stability of the dye in the polymers. Crystal
violet, a topical antiseptic, possesses antibacterial and antifungal
properties.34 It is still listed by the
World Health Organization even though new drugs have superseded its
use in the medical field, and clinical trials showed its efficiency
to treat infected wounds, superficial skin, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections.35,36 Hence, if
there is significant leaching of the dye, it is not expected to show
toxicity toward human cells.

Figure 6 Leaching of crystal violet dye (mol dm–3) from
the CV-incorporated polymers into PBS solution at 37 °C was measured
as a function of time (h).

In addition, a similar setup was used to detect whether the
ZnO-incorporated
samples release nanoparticles into PBS solution. There was no observable
change in the amount of leaching, color, or conductivity of the solution
(data not shown), showing that the ZnO in the polymer matrix is more
stable to leaching in contrast to CV.

2.2.1 Antibacterial
Investigation
The
bactericidal properties of the following PDMS samples were examined
against a Gram-positive bacterium, S. aureus 8325-4, and a Gram-negative bacterium, E. coli ATCC 25922, under dark and light conditions: undoped PDMS polymer
(control), zinc oxide-incorporated PDMS (ZnO), crystal violet-coated
PDMS (CV), 0.5% ZnO-doped PDMS (0.5ZnO), 0.5% ZnO-doped PDMS with
CV (0.5ZnO–CV), 1% ZnO-doped PDMS (1.0ZnO), 1% ZnO-doped PDMS
with CV (1.0ZnO–CV), 5% ZnO-doped PDMS (5.0ZnO), and 5% ZnO-doped
PDMS with CV (5.0ZnO–CV). The photobactericidal activity of
the CV-coated PDMS samples was activated with a white light source
emitting an average light intensity of 6500 ± 300 lux at a distance
of 25 cm from the samples (see Supporting Information, Figure S4). Also, a control sample set was tested
in the dark for the same exposure times.

Figure 7 demonstrates the bactericidal activities
of the samples against S. aureus after
45 min of incubation in the dark and in white light. Under dark conditions,
none of the polymer samples showed statistically significant reduction
in S. aureus numbers. Similarly, in
white light, no significant killing of S. aureus was observed on the 0.5ZnO sample surface compared to that on the
control sample. However, a greater reduction in bacterial numbers
was apparent on the surfaces of both the 1.0ZnO and 5.0ZnO samples
(P-value < 0.01 for both). Furthermore, the 0.5ZnO–CV
sample caused ∼1 log reduction in the number of viable bacteria,
with enhanced killing compared to that on the sample containing CV
alone (0.35 log reduction). The effect of both the 1.0ZnO–CV
and 5.0ZnO–CV samples was even more remarkable, reducing bacterial
counts to below the detection limit (≥4 log, P-value = 0.002) in the light, within 45 min.

Figure 7 Number of viable colony
counts of S. aureus 8325-4 on treated
PDMS squares after incubation in the dark and
in white light for 45 min. The orange and purple asterisks indicate S. aureus levels below detection limits.

The antibacterial properties of the same polymers
were also investigated
against E. coli under the same conditions
but with a longer exposure time (Figure 8). In the dark, over a 90 min period, no
statistically significant decrease in the numbers of E. coli was demonstrated by the samples containing
ZnO NPs relative to that by the control polymer. On the other hand,
except the polymer containing CV alone, all of the samples containing
ZnO and coated with CV displayed statistically significant (P-value < 0.01) activity compared to that of the control
sample.

Figure 8 Number of viable colony counts of E. coli ATCC 25922 on treated PDMS squares after incubation in the dark
and in white light for 45 min. The purple asterisk indicates E. coli levels below detection limits.

After 90 min of white light exposure, the 0.5ZnO–CV
sample
and the 1.0ZnO–CV sample achieved 0.70 log and 1.33 log reductions
in the numbers of E. coli (Figure 8). Moreover, the
5.0ZnO–CV sample displayed a highly significant reduction in
bacterial numbers after 90 min of irradiation, with bacterial counts
reduced to below the detection limit (≥4 log, P-value = 0.002).

The difference between the susceptibilities
of the Gram-positive
(S. aureus) and the Gram-negative (E. coli) bacteria is most probably because of the
differences in their cell wall structures.37 Whereas Gram-positive bacteria possess a single thick peptidoglycan
layer (20–80 nm), Gram-negative bacteria contain a thinner
peptidoglycan layer (7–8 nm) but possess a second (outer) membrane,16 reducing the permeability of radicals and making
them less susceptible to dye-coated polymeric surfaces.38,39 Overall, the results show that the polymer containing ZnO or CV
alone does not possess potent antibacterial properties. Hence, it
is required to combine both agents into the polymer to fabricate a
superior self-sterilizing material that shows efficacious photobactericidal
activity against both E. coli and S. aureus.

To evaluate the efficacy of these
polymeric surfaces, their photobactericidal
properties were compared with those of other antibacterial systems
reported in the literature. For example, under white light conditions
(40 000 lux), protoporphyrin- and zinc protoporphyrin-grafted
nylon fibers resulted in 5.6% reduction in the numbers of S. aureus, whereas they did not show significant
killing of E. coli.40 Moreover, Sehmi et al. reported CV in combination with
∼18 nm ZnO NPs incorporated in polyurethane squares. Upon illumination
with a white light source (6600 ± 990 lux), these polymer samples
caused lethal photosensitization of both E. coli and S. aureus in 1 and 4 h, respectively.41

In our previous work, CV was encapsulated
into PDMS squares in
combination with ZnO NPs used in the present study, and they demonstrated
significant antibacterial activity against S. aureus and E. coli in 1 and 4 h, respectively,
under white light conditions (∼10 500 lux).42 These results validate the potent photobactericidal
activity observed with the 5.0ZnO–CV surfaces reported here,
achieving decreases in bacterial numbers of greater than 4 logs for
both S. aureus and E.
coli in only 45 and 90 min, respectively.

These
antibacterial materials can also be compared with other antibacterial
surfaces that showed enhanced antibacterial activity. For example,
at a much lower white light intensity of ∼500 lux, significant
lethal photodestruction of S. aureus and E. coli was achieved using polyurethane
samples containing the combination of CV and ZnO NPs (∼2–4
nm in size). This enhanced antibacterial efficacy may be ascribed
to the small size of ZnO NPs because there is a correlation between
the decreasing size of ZnO NPs and their antibacterial activity.19,43,44 However, this method involves
complex, laborious, time-consuming synthesis of the NPs and is only
applicable to soft materials. Therefore, the proposed method in this
study outperforms its counterparts in many aspects such as its easy
fabrication, the low-cost materials utilized, and the material’s
high versatility for being coated on a wide range of substrates (e.g.
metal, glass, paper, and soft polymer plates) (see Supporting Information, Figure S5).

The antibacterial behavior
of CV is well established. Upon light
activation of the dye, two different photochemical reaction pathways
occur simultaneously: one generates hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and superoxide ions (O2•–) through the electron transfer process (type I) and the other generates
singlet oxygen (1O2) through energy transfer
(type II).45 Photogenerated ROS can attack
bacteria via a non-site-specific multiple attack mechanism (unlike
antibiotics, which usually have a singlet target) including the disruption
of cellular membranes and DNA by means of oxidative damage, making
bacteria unlikely to develop resistance because resistance normally
occurs when a bactericide has a single target.14,46,47

In contrast to that of CV, the killing
mechanism of ZnO is still
unclear, but there are various mechanisms proposed in the literature,
including the production of ROS,19,20,48−52 the release of zinc ions,21,48,53,54 and the accumulation of NPs in
the bacterial cytoplasm and on the outer membrane of Gram-negative
bacteria.19 Some studies showing significant
antibacterial activity of ZnO in the dark attributed this to the release
of zinc ions from a ZnO suspension, which penetrate into the bacteria,
damaging DNA and resulting in cell death.23,55,56 However, there are many studies indicating
that the concentrations of released Zn2+ ions were not
high enough to cause nanotoxicity.19,20,57,58 Lakshmi et al. proved
that its antibacterial activity is mainly attributed to ROS in the
dark59 rather than release of zinc ions
(zinc ion dissolution) and ZnO internalization.22,23,60,61 The presence
of surface defects on ZnO NPs can generate ROS under lower-energy-light
illumination (i.e., visible light). Previous study has demonstrated
that the encapsulation of ZnO in combination with CV into polyurethane
can increase the photobactericidal activity of the dye via both type
I and type 2 pathways,41 which is in good
agreement with the data presented here.

Regarding real-world
applications, antimicrobial materials should
to be durable, environmentally friendly, and not harmful to humans.62 Therefore, it is imperative that the dye incorporated
in the polymer does not leach significantly or rub off upon contact
with hands or disinfectant wipes that are often used to reduce the
risk of the spread of infection. We have demonstrated that the dye-coated
samples proved to be stable to contact with aqueous solution at 37°.
The amount of dye leached from the samples was relatively small relative
to the concentration (20 000 ppm), resulting in dermal irradiation
or sensitization over an extended period of clinical assessment.36 Furthermore, to determine the stability of the
modified polymers against standard hospital hygiene regime conditions,
they were vigorously wiped with Clinell wipes that are utilized to
clean hard surfaces on the wards in University College London Hospital
NHS Trust hospitals. There was no visual evidence of dye removal from
the modified polymer after rigorous wiping with 70% alcohol, proving
its robustness against our standard hospital cleaning protocol and,
hence, transmission of dye upon touching is unlikely. Similarly, the
leaching of ZnO NPs and their transfer by human contact is minimal
because we have shown that they are well embedded into the polymer.
ZnO NPs have been widely utilized in the cosmetics and food industry,
and their toxicity in humans has been extensively investigated, with
the conclusion that it depends on many factors such as their size,
shape, route of administration, and dosage. Studies have showed that
their penetration through skin is improbable although other routes
of administration of these nanoparticles can demonstrate harmful effects
at high doses (>100 μg mL–1).63,64

3 Conclusions
In this
study, ZnO NPs have been successfully embedded with different
nanoparticle concentrations in PDMS, followed by incorporating CV
using a simple swell–encapsulation–shrink process to
fabricate white-light-activated antibacterial surfaces. The ZnO/CV
composites possess superior antibacterial activities that are dependent
upon the concentration of zinc in the polymer films. Among them, the
5.0ZnO–CV composite is proved to be one of the most efficacious
antibacterial polymer surfaces developed to date, active in light
conditions relevant to U.K. hospitals and exhibiting lethal photosensitization
of S. aureus in just 45 min and of E. coli in just 90 min, with a minimum of a 4 log
reduction in the numbers of both bacteria. Because release or transmission
of dye and nanoparticle upon using this polymer coating is improbable,
it has potential applications from healthcare settings (e.g., doors
and hospital bed rails) to electronic devices (e.g., tablet and mobile
phone covers) to help reduce bacterial surface contamination and thus
reduce the risk of the spread of infection.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Chemicals and Substrates
All chemicals
used in this study were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.
except for acetone (VWR, U.K.). The PDMS prepolymer and curing agent
(SYLGARD 184) were purchased from Dow Corning Corporation.

4.2 Materials Synthesis
4.2.1 Preparation of ZnO NPs/PDMS
Composites
Polymer/nanoparticle composites with various ZnO
contents (0, 0.5,
1, and 5 wt %) were produced. The appropriate amount of ZnO NPs was
dispersed in PDMS (monomer/crosslink = 10:1 in mass), and the mixture
was homogenized by hand-stirring. Afterward, the slurry was degassed
in a desiccator for 15 min, followed by casting on glass substrates
and they were cured in a preheated oven (100 °C) for 45 min.
After the cooling, the polymer sheets were peeled off from the substrates
and were cut into smaller pieces (squares 2.0 cm × 2.0 cm).

4.2.2 Preparation of Polymers with Embedded Crystal
Violet
Bare PDMS and ZnO-incorporated samples were coated
with CV (by placing 2 cm × 2 cm squares into 750 ppm solutions
of CV in acetone for 24 h) before removal, washed, and air-dried (24 h).

4.3 Material
Characterization
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken using JEOL JEM 1200EX
with a 4 megapixel Gatan Orius SC200 charge-coupled device camera
at an acceleration voltage of 120 kV.

The infrared absorbance
spectra of the modified polymer samples were recorded within the range
of 1000–4000 cm–1 with an accumulation of
16 scans per sample using a Bruker Platinum ATR.

X-ray diffraction
patterns of the modified samples were recorded
using a Stoe diffractometer with monochromated Mo Kα1 radiation (λ = 0.7093 Å) in transmission mode over the
angle range 20–70°/2θ°.

The photoluminescence
(PL) spectra of the treated samples were
recorded using a Fluoromax 4.0 Jobin Yvon Horiba spectrofluorometer.

UV–vis absorption spectra of the ZnO NP aqueous suspension
and CV-coated polymer samples were measured using a PerkinElmer Lambda
950 UV–vis spectrometer over a range of 200–800 nm (full
range not shown).

Water contact angle measurements were performed
using an FTA-1000
drop shape instrument. A 3 μL water droplet was dropped onto
the surface of the samples, and the contact angle of the droplet was
calculated using FTA32 software.

4.4 Functional
Testing
4.4.1 Leaching Test
The stability of
the CV-coated PDMS polymers in solution was examined by immersing
2 cm2 squares in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (10 mL)
at 37 °C for an extended period of time. The concentration of
CV that leached into the PBS solution was recorded periodically using
UV–vis spectroscopy (596 nm, Pharmacia Biotech Ultrospec 2000)
and by comparing the absorbance of PBS at 596 nm with a CV calibration
curve.

4.4.2 Dye Adherence Testing
All samples
containing crystal violet were wiped rigorously with a 70% isopropyl
alcohol wipe (AZOwipeTM, Synergy Health) to determine whether the
dye adhered to the sample surface under standard cleaning regimes.

4.4.3 Bactericidal Assay
The following
polymer samples (2 cm × 2 cm) were utilized in the bactericidal
assays: bare PDMS polymer (control), zinc oxide-incorporated PDMS
(ZnO), crystal violet-coated PDMS (CV), 0.5% ZnO-doped PDMS (0.5ZnO),
0.5% ZnO-doped PDMS with CV (0.5ZnO–CV), 1% ZnO-doped PDMS
(1.0ZnO), 1% ZnO-doped PDMS with CV (1.0ZnO–CV), 5% ZnO-doped
PDMS (5.0ZnO), and 5% ZnO-doped PDMS with CV (5.0ZnO–CV). These
samples were evaluated against E. coli ATCC 25922 and S. aureus 8325-4.
These organisms were stored at −70 °C in brain–heart-infusion
broth (BHI, Oxoid) containing 20% (v/v) glycerol and propagated on
either MacConkey agar (Oxoid Ltd.) in the case of E.
coli or mannitol salt agar (Oxoid Ltd.) in the case
of S. aureus, for a maximum of two
subcultures at intervals of 2 weeks.

A single colony of either E. coli or S. aureus was cultured in BHI broth (10 mL) for 17 h, shaking at 37 °C.
The bacterial pellet was harvested by centrifugation (20 °C,
4000 rpm, 5 min) and washed in PBS (10 mL). After centrifugation again
under the same conditions, the bacteria were resuspended in PBS (10
mL). The washed bacterial suspension was then diluted 1 in 1000 in
PBS to give an inoculum of ∼106 CFU mL–1.

Duplicates of each polymer sample were inoculated with 25
μL
of the inoculum and covered with a sterile cover slip (1.8 cm ×
1.8 cm). The samples were then irradiated for the required time period
using a white light source that emits an average light intensity of
6500 ± 300 lux at a distance of 25 cm from the samples. A further
set of samples (in duplicate) was maintained under dark conditions
for the duration of the irradiation time.

Post irradiation,
the inoculated samples and cover slips were transferred
to a tube containing PBS (5 mL) and vortexed (60 s). The neat suspension
and 10-fold serial dilutions were plated on the appropriate agar.
The plates were incubated aerobically for 24 h (E.
coli) or for 48 h (S. aureus) at 37 °C, and the were colonies enumerated to determine the
number of viable bacteria. The bacterial numbers in the inoculum were
also determined in each experiment by viable colony counting. Each
experiment contained two technical replicates, and the experiment
was reproduced three times. The Mann–Whitney U test was used
to analyze the statistical significance of the data.
