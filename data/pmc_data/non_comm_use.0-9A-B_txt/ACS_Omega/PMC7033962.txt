complexes [Au(HL1)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (1), [Au(HL2)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (2), and [Au(HL3)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (3) were
obtained with (E)-2-(1-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propan-2-ylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide
(HL1), (E)-N-methyl-2-(1-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propan-2-ylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide
(HL2), and (E)-2-(1-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propan-2-ylidene)-N-phenylhydrazinecarbothioamide (HL3). All
compounds were assayed for their cytotoxic activities against HCT-116
colorectal carcinoma cells under normoxia and hypoxia conditions and
against nonmalignant HEK-293 human embryonic kidney cells under normoxia
conditions. The thiosemicarbazone ligands HL1-HL3 were inactive against HCT-116 cells under hypoxia but while HL3 was inactive, HL1 and HL2 proved
to be cytotoxic to both cell lineages under normoxia conditions. Complexes
(1–3) and the triethylphosphinegod(I)
precursor proved to be active against both cell lineages in normoxia
as well as in hypoxia. While 1 and 3 revealed
to be active against HEK-293 and HCT-116 cells, being approximately
as active against HCT-116 cells in normoxia as under hypoxia, complex
(2) proved to be more active against HCT-116 cells under
hypoxia than under normoxia conditions, and more active against HCT-116
cells than against the nonmalignant HEK-293 cells, with the selectivity
index, calculated as SI = IC50HEK-293/IC50HCT-116hypoxia, equal to 3.7, similar to the value obtained for the control drug
tirapazamine (tirapazamine (TPZ), SI = 4). Although the compounds
showed distinct cytotoxic activities, the electrochemical behaviors
of HL1-HL3 were very similar, as were the
behaviors of complexes (1–3). Complex
(2) deserves special interest since it was significantly
more active under hypoxia than under normoxia conditions. Hence, in
this case, selective reduction of the nitro group in a low oxygen
pressure environment, resulting in toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and damage to DNA or other biomolecules, might operate, while for
the remaining compounds, other modes of action probably occur.

Introduction
Thiosemicarbazones
are an important class of bioactive compounds
that show antimicrobial, antiviral, antiparasitic, and antineoplastic
activities.1 Functionalization of thiosemicarbazones
with a variety of pharmacophoric groups aiming to design new drug
candidates has been extensively investigated.2,3

Nitroimidazole-containing compounds show antimicrobial,4,5 antiparasitic,6 and antineoplastic7 activities related to their ability to undergo
a reduction of the nitro group, generating toxic reactive oxygen species
(ROS) such as the nitro anion radical, NO2•–, under conditions of
low oxygen concentration, which result in damage of DNA and other
biomolecules. Hence, the presence of nitroimidazole may result in
hypoxic selectivity.8

Hypoxia is
frequently a characteristic of late-stage solid tumors.
In solid tumor tissues, which grow and proliferate, oxygen consumption
is higher than oxygen supply and transport, and the distance between
cells and the abnormal vasculature increases, weakening oxygen circulation.9,10 Hence, hypoxia-selective compounds may in principle exhibit anticancer
effects with reduced systemic toxicity.

Metal complexes with
thiosemicarbazones also show pharmacological
applications as antineoplastic11−13 antimicrobial,14 antitrypanosomal,15,16 and antiviral17 agents.

Gold(I, III) complexes with different
ligands have shown in vitro
and in vivo antitumor activities.18 Gold(I)
and gold(III) complexes with thiosemicarbazones and bis(thiosemicarbazones)
have been shown to exhibit antiproliferative activity against cancer
cells19−21 and to act as inhibitors of the seleno-enzyme thioredoxin
reductase (TrxR).19−21

Auranofin, triethylphosphine (2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-1-d-thiopyranosato-S)gold(I), was the first
metal–phosphine complex to be introduced into clinics for the
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.22 After
the introduction of auranofin for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis,
numerous gold(I) complexes with thiolate, phosphine, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC), and thiourea have been evaluated for
their antiproliferative activities.23 In
a previous work, we demonstrated that gold(I) complexes with 2-acetylpyridine-
and 2-benzoylpyridine-derived thiosemicarbazones were cytotoxic to
leukemia and solid tumor cells.19

We also demonstrated that hydrazones and thiosemicarbazones derived
from secnidazole, a 5-nitroimidazole-containing compound, as well
as their copper(II),24 silver(I), and bismuth(III)25 complexes were inactive against aerobic bacteria
but proved to be highly active against anaerobic strains, indicating
that reduction of the nitro group under low oxygen concentrations
might be part of their antimicrobial mode of action.

Tirapazamine
(TPZ) is a hypoxia-activatable bio-reducible prodrug,
which can be transformed from a nontoxic into a toxic species via
a one-electron reduction in the hypoxic environment, resulting in
selective antineoplastic effects against hypoxic tumors with minimal
toxicity to nonmalignant tissues.26

In the present work, triethylphosphinegold(I) complexes were obtained
with secnidazole-derived thiosemicarbazones (Figure 1) and their cytotoxic activities against
solid tumor and healthy cells under normoxia and hypoxia conditions
were evaluated in comparison with TPZ.

complexes with secnidazole-derived
thiosemicarbazones [Au(HL1)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (1), [Au(HL2)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (2) and [Au(HL3)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 (3).

Results and Discussion
Crystal Structure Determinations
The crystal data analysis
indicates that HL2 crystallized in the P-1 triclinic, while HL3 crystallized in the Pbca orthorhombic space group. HL2 formed twin
crystals with the same composition and unit cell but with different
orientations, indicating a pseudo-merohedral twin. Of all reflections,
45.9% were indexed as component one, 20.4% as component two, 18% as
overlapping reflections belonging to both components, and 15.7% were
nonindexed.

Selected bond distances and angles in the structures
of HL2 and HL3 are shown in Table 1. In both compounds, the C6-S
and N3-C5 bond distances (1.689(4) and 1.275(5) Å for HL2 and 1.6709(16) and 1.272(2) Å for HL3, respectively)
indicate the presence of C=S and C=N double bonds, as
expected.27 Structural representations
and the atom numbering scheme for HL2 and HL3 are shown in Figure 2. The molecular conformation in both compounds is similar. The dihedral
angle between the imidazole ring and the thiosemicarbazone fragment
is 77.2(1)° in HL2 and 83.88(5)° in HL3. In HL3, the dihedral angle between the benzenic ring
and the thiosemicarbazone fragment is 14.43(8)°.

The crystal packings
of the compounds are very distinct, mainly
due to the presence of water molecules and of the phenyl ring in HL3 (see Figures S1 and S2, Supporting
Information). In the crystal packing of HL2, an N5-H···N1
intermolecular hydrogen bond was observed (d(N5···N1)
= 2.960(6)Å), with the formation of a dimeric motif (see Table S1, Supporting Information). An N4-H···S
interaction is also observed in this compound (d(N4···S)
= 3.457(4)Å) that gives rise to a one-dimensional (1-D) network
arrangement. In the crystal packing of HL3, strong intermolecular
interactions among HL3 molecules were not observed and
stabilization of the solid is due to N4-H···O3 (d(N4···O3) = 2.937(2)Å) and O3-H···N1
(d(O3···N1) = 2.853(2)Å) intermolecular
hydrogen bonds among HL3 and water molecules (see Table S2, Supporting Information).

The
Hirshfeld surfaces (HS) as the fingerprint plot analysis28,29 show that changing from methyl in HL2 to phenyl in HL3 promotes relevant modifications in the solid state. Comparing
the HS of the compounds (Figure 3), it is possible to notice the difference in their
shapes and, as expected, in volume (HL2 = 314.64 Å3 and HL3 = 388.79 Å3). The distribution
of the intermolecular interactions is also distinct in the compounds.
In HL3, the intermolecular interactions are stronger
than those in HL2, since the di + de distance is 4.7 Å in HL2 and 4.5 Å in HL3. However, the strongest
interactions are related to N···H contacts in both
compounds. The most representative interactions in these solids are
the nondirectional H···H contacts that represent 39.1
and 39.9% for HL2 and HL3, respectively
(Figure S3a). The O···H
contacts’ contributions (Figure S3b) are similar in HL2 and HL3: 20.5% in HL2 and 22.1% in HL3, respectively. However,
due to the presence of water molecules, the fingerprint plots in HL3 are asymmetric for these contacts as well as for the N···H
contacts (Figure S3c). The N···H
and S···H contributions correspond to 14.2 and 15.3%,
respectively, for HL2 and 5.0 and 9.0% for HL3. The fingerprint plots did not show the characteristic wing pattern,
indicating that CH···π interactions are not present
in these compounds.

of (a) HL2 and (b) HL3.

Formation of the Triethylphosphinegold(I) Complexes
C, H,
and N analyses, as well as molar conductivity data, are in
accordance with the formation of [Au(HL)P(CH2CH3)3]PF6 complexes in which one thiosemicarbazone
ligand and one triethylphosphine ligand are attached to the gold(I)
center.

Spectroscopic Characterization
Infrared Spectra
The vibrations attributed to ν(C=S),
observed at 804–772 cm–1 in HL1–HL3, could not be attributed in 1–3 due to overlapping with the PF6 vibrations. However, the ν(C5=N) absorption, observed
at 1530–1555 cm–1 in the infrared spectra
of the free bases, shifts to 1528–1540 cm–1 in those of complexes (1–3), probably
as a consequence of coordination through the sulfur.

NMR Spectra
NMR spectra were recorded in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO)-d6. The 1H resonances
were attributed based on chemical shifts and multiplicities, and using
two-dimensional (2D) homonuclear 1H–1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY). The carbon type (C, CH) was defined
by means of distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT-135)
experiments and the attributions were made using 2D heteronuclear
multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) experiments.

In the 1H NMR spectra of the free thiosemicarbazones, a signal corresponding
to N4-H was observed at δ 10.31–10.87. This signal was
found at δ 10.73–11.40 in complexes (1–3). The signal of N5-H, observed at δ 6.41–8.83
in the free thiosemicarbazones, shifts to δ 7.69–9.56
in complexes (1–3) as a consequence
of coordination through the sulfur.25

In the 13C{1H} NMR spectra of HL1-HL3, the signal at δ 147.0–148.1 was assigned
to carbon C5. This signal was found at δ 149.8–152.0
in complexes (1–3). The signals of
C=S, observed at δ 175.8–178.9 in the spectra
of the thiosemicarbazones,24 shift to δ
171.2–176.8 in complexes (1–3), indicating
coordination through the sulfur.25

Electrochemistry Studies
Secnidazole and HL1-HL3 display a stable well-defined couple (system Ic/Ia),
with EpIc in the −1120 to −1130 mV range, related to
a one-electron transfer process attributed to the formation of a stable
nitro radical anion (R–NO2•–). The voltammograms also exhibit
a wave near −2000 mV, assigned to the generation of hydroxylamine
(R–NHOH) and, in some cases, an irreversible oxidation close
to −500 mV, assigned to the formation of nitroso (R–NO)
species (see eqs 1–3).24 1   2   3  The voltammograms of complexes (1–3) (see Figures 4 and S16, Supporting Information) exhibit two quasi-reversible
processes that were assigned to R–NO2/R–NO2•– (peaks Ic and Ia), eq 4. The EpIc values indicate that the formation of R–NO2•– is favored in (1–3) in comparison to the thiosemicarbazone
ligands (Table 2).

An irreversible oxidation process (IVa) was also observed
at 1137–1410
mV, which was attributed to the Au(I)–Au(II) oxidation, eq 5. 4   5  The EpIc for complexes (1–3) were
found in the - (978–1065) mV range, while for
the thiosemicarazone ligands, these values were in the - (1120–1130)
mV range, indicating that reduction of the nitro group is favored
in the complexes.

Cytotoxic Activity
Taking into consideration
that the
nitroimidazole pharmacophoric group could, in principle, undergo reduction
under anaerobic conditions resulting in the release of ROS that provokes
DNA and protein damage, the cytotoxic effects of the compounds under
study were evaluated against HCT-116 (colorectal cancer) cells under
normoxia and hypoxia conditions and against HEK-293 (human embryonic
kidney) nonmalignant cells in normoxia (see Table 3).

tested (100 μM), inhibition of 50% of cell viability was not
verified and hence IC50 is above that value.

b SI: selectivity indexes (IC50 HEK-293/IC50 HCT-116 normoxia and hypoxia); ND: not determined, since the compound was inactive in the experimental
conditions.

Although ligands HL1–HL3 and complexes (1–3) were designed to undergo a selective reduction
of the nitro group under hypoxia, HL1–HL3 were not active against HCT-116 cells under hypoxia conditions.
However, while HL3 was inactive against all of the tested
cell lineages under normoxia and hypoxia conditions, HL1 and HL2 were active against HCT 116 and HEK-293 cells
under normoxia but not under hypoxia conditions. The values of log
P are 1.06 (HL1), 1.39 (HL2) and 3.24 (HL3), indicating that HL3 is probably too lipophilic
to reach the target.

As shown in Table 2, HL1–HL3 exhibit very unfavorable
reduction potentials, and this might be the reason why they did not
show cytotoxic activity under hypoxia. Upon coordination to gold(I),
the reduction potentials become less negative so that complexes (1–3) and the triethylphosphinegod(I) precursor
were active against both cell lineages in normoxia as well as under
hypoxia conditions. Complex (1) was revealed to be active
against HEK-293 and HCT-116 cells, being slightly more active against
HCT-116 cells in normoxia than under hypoxia. Complex (3) was active against both cell lineages, being as active in normoxia
as in hypoxia against the malignant HCT-116 cells. Since HL3 was inactive against all cell lineages, the cytotoxic effects of
its organogold(I) complex (3) are probably due to the
presence of the triethylphosphinegold(I) precursor, which shows cytotoxic
effects against HCT-116 cells with IC50 values similar
to those of complex (3), being more cytotoxic than 3 against HEK-293 cells.

In contrast, complex (2) proved to be more active
against HCT-116 in hypoxia than in normoxia conditions, with the selectivity
index, calculated as SI = IC50HEK-293/IC50HCT-116 hypoxia, equal to 3.7, similar to the value obtained for the control drug
tirapazamine (TPZ, SI = 4). Interestingly, [AuP(CH2CH3)3Cl] also proved to be slightly more active against
HCT-116 cells in hypoxia but its selectivity index was much lower,
SI = 0.6.

The electrochemical behaviors of HL1-HL3 are very similar, as are the behaviors of their triethylphosphinegold(I)
complexes (1–3), although the compounds
showed distinct cytotoxic activities. The behavior of complex (2), however, deserves interest, since it was significantly
more active against HCT-116 cells under hypoxia than under normoxia
conditions and, hence, in this case, selective reduction of the nitro
group in a low oxygen pressure milieu might operate, while in the
remaining compounds, other modes of action probably occur.

In
fact, complex (2) exhibited a selective index similar
to that of tirapazamine, an experimental anticancer drug that is only
activated in hypoxic areas of solid tumors.30 Hypoxia-activated prodrugs such as nitroimidazoles, nitrobenzenes,
and N-oxides are inert prodrugs that diffuse through
the extravascular tissue to hypoxic sites before their activation
by means of a bio-reductive process. The common mode of action within
these classes is the monoelectronic reduction of the bio-reducible
prodrug by a reductase, with the formation of a radical anion. Under
hypoxia conditions, the radical anion undergoes further reduction
to an active agent that provokes cellular toxicity, fragments, or
rearranges to produce a reactive species or activated drug.31

In the presence of oxygen, this radical
is reoxidized, releasing
superoxide, which is easily processed by the cell-protective systems.
This “futile” redox cycling results in low amounts of
the prodrug radical in aerobic cells, leading to hypoxia-selective
cell killing. Inhibition of drug reduction by oxygen through the redox
cycling process was initially shown for nitro compounds and was later
demonstrated to be responsible for the hypoxia-selective cytotoxicity
of nitroimidazoles.32

A common characteristic
of the bio-reductive nitro-containing prodrugs
presently in development is that their active metabolites are DNA-reactive
cytotoxins.32 Hence, a plausible hypothesis
to explain the cytotoxic activity of complex (2) against
HCT-116 cells under hypoxia may involve its bio-reduction with the
formation of the toxic nitro anion radical NO2•–. In fact, evidence
for the formation of the nitro anion radical in a cell-free medium
was obtained from the electrochemical studies of this complex. In
addition, we previously demonstrated that the same 5-nitroimidazole
ligands and their copper(II),24 silver(I),
and bismuth(III)25 complexes were inactive
against Gram-positive and -negative aerobic bacteria
but proved to be active against anaerobic bacterial strains, suggesting
reduction of the nitro group under low oxygen concentrations with
production of the toxic nitro anion radical to be part of their mode
of action.

Although complexes (1) and (3) showed
electrochemical behaviors similar to that of complex (2), being also able to form the nitro anion radical in a cell-free
medium, the lack of hypoxia selectivity of (1) and (3) might be related to distinct intrinsic sensitivities of
their radical anion to oxygen, which influence the kinetic balance
between the forward reactions and the back reaction with oxygen.31

Taking into consideration the hypoxia-selective
cytotoxicity of
complex (2) and the resistance of tumor cells to radiotherapy
and to most anticancer drugs in hypoxic regions, further investigations
on this complex are of utmost relevance. In fact, gold compounds have
been suggested as a potential alternative to platinum-based chemotherapeutic
agents for colon tumor treatment.33

Conclusions
The foregoing results suggest that coordination of the secnidazole-derived
(E)-N-methyl-2-(1-(2-methyl-5-nitro-1H-imidazol-1-yl)propan-2-ylidene)hydrazinecarbothioamide
(HL2) to triethylphosphinegold(I) as in complex (2) was a valuable strategy for improving selectivity against
HCT-116 cancer cells under hypoxia conditions. Indeed, since complex
(2) proved to be as selective as the bio-reducible control
drug tirapazamine, and considering that this complex contains the
secnidazole and triethylphosphinegold(I) structural motifs, which
are already used in the clinics, it deserves to be further investigated
for its antitumor effects in vivo and its mechanism of action.

Experimental
Section
Materials and Measurements
All common chemicals were
purchased from Aldrich and were used as received. Microanalyses were
performed on a PerkinElmer CHN 2400 analyzer. A Digimed model DM3
conductivity bridge was used for molar conductivity measurements.
Infrared spectra (4000–400 cm–1) were recorded
on a PerkinElmer Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) Spectrum GX spectrometer
using KBr pellets. NMR spectra were obtained with a Bruker DPX-400
Advance (400 MHz) and a Bruker DPX200 (200 MHz) spectrometer using
DMSO-d6 as the solvent and TMS as the
internal reference.

Cyclic voltammetry experiments were performed
at room temperature with a three-electrode cell (with a volumetric
capacity of 10 mL) in an Autolab type PGSTAT30 equipment using Nova
2.1.3 software. A Metrohm glassy carbon electrode was used as the
working electrode, and the auxiliary electrode was a platinum wire.
Ag/AgCl, Cl– (3.0 M) was employed as the reference
electrode. The glassy carbon electrode was previously fine-polished
with a 0.3 μm alumina slurry on a polishing felt for 5 min.
Solutions were prepared in spectroscopic dimethylformamide (DMF) containing
1 mM analyte and 0.1 M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate (TBAP) as supporting
electrolyte. Before recording the voltammograms, the test solution
was thoroughly purged with high-purity nitrogen to remove any traces
of dissolved oxygen. Cyclic voltammograms were recorded in the 2.00
to −2.00 V potential range using a scan rate of 250 mV s–1.

Syntheses of Triethylphosphinegold(I) Complexes
(1–3)
Complexes (1–3) were obtained by reacting [AuP(P(CH2CH3)3)Cl] with the desired thiosemicarbazone
in a 1:1 M/L
ratio. Hence, 0.5 mmol of [AuP(P(CH2CH3)3)Cl] was dissolved in a mixture of 6 mL of methanol and 6
mL of dichloromethane, followed by the addition of 0.7 mmol of KPF6 and a slight excess (0.7 mmol) of the appropriate thiosemicarbazone.
The reaction mixture was kept under reflux and stirring in the dark
for 3 h (see Figure 1). The yellow solid formed after solvent evaporation was filtered
off and washed with diethylether, and dried under reduced pressure.
The complexes were characterized by means of microanalyses and their
infrared, and their de 1H, 13C, DEPT 135, COSY,
HMQC, and 31P NMR spectra.

Crystal Structure Determinations
Crystals of HL2 and HL3 were obtained during
the recrystallization
of complexes (2) and (3) in DMF. Crystals’
data, data collection details, and refinement results are listed in Table 4. The single-crystal
data for compounds were collected using an Agilent SuperNova diffractometer
with Mo Kα (λ = 0.71073 Å) radiation at room temperature
(298 K). The data collection, cell refinements, and data reduction
were performed using CRYSALISPRO software.34 The structures were solved by direct methods and refined using SHELXL-2018/335 All nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic
thermal parameters. H atoms connected to carbon were placed in idealized
positions and treated by a rigid model, with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C),
while H atoms from NH groups were obtained directly by difference
maps and fixed with a N–H distance around 0.88 Å and Uiso(H)
= 1.2Ueq(N). CCDC 1949760 and 1949761 contain the supplementary crystallographic
data for HL2 and HL3, respectively. The
figures were drawn using ORTEP-3 for Windows36 and Mercury.37

Evaluation of the Cytotoxic
Effects of the Compounds
Colorectal carcinoma (HCT-116) and
human embryonic kidney (HEK-293)
cells were donated by Dr. Marcel Leist, University of Konstanz/Germany,
and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) medium (Sigma Aldrich) with 10% fetal serum (GIBCO BRL, Grand
Island, NY) and enriched with a 1% antibiotic solution (100 IU/mL
penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island,
NY)). Cytotoxic activity was based on the mitochondrial reduction
rate of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide
(MTT) to formazan crystals.38 HCT-116 and
HEK-293 cells were seeded at the density of 5 × 103 cells per well (96-well plate) and preincubated overnight for stabilization
under hypoxia conditions (1% O2, 5% CO2, 94%
N2 at 37 °C) and normoxia (5% CO2, 95%
atmospheric air at 37 °C) as described by Harrison and co-workers.39 After stabilization, cells were incubated for
72 h with the compounds and with tirapazamine (TPZ) as a positive
control, using seven serial 1:5 dilutions (100–0.0064 μM),
under conditions of hypoxia and normoxia. The IC50 (inhibitory
concentration of 50% cell proliferation) was determined by nonlinear
regression using GraphPad Prism Version 5.01 software (GraphPad Software
Inc., La Jolla, CA). All compounds were tested in four independent
experiments performed in triplicate and the solvent (DMSO 0.5%) was
used as the control. The results were expressed as mean ± standard
deviation of the mean of the percentage of viability in relation to
the negative control (DMSO, 0.5%), calculated as follows: percentage
of cell viability (%) = [(OD of treated mean/OD negative control)
x100].38

Selectivity indexes (SI)
of the compounds were also evaluated using the ratio between the 50%
inhibitory concentration of cell viability for nonmalignant and tumor
cells, SI = IC50HEK-293/IC50HCT-116, under normoxia
and hypoxia conditions.
