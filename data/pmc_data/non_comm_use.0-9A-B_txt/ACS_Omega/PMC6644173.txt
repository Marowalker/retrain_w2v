Photochromic
materials are available by a postpolymerization surface
modification of diverse polymers in a multistep sequential process
mediated, first, by carbene insertion chemistry, second, by diazonium
coupling with a tethered precursor, and finally by coupling to a spiropyran.
This three-step sequence is efficient, and surface loading densities
of 1013 molecules cm–2 are typically
achievable, leading to materials with observable photochromic and
wettability behavior, which operate over multiple cycles without significant
photobleaching or loss of efficacy. Materials suitable for application
in this process include both reactive, but also lower surface energy
polymers. Although the process is particularly efficient for high
surface area materials, surface modification onto lower surface area
substrates, while being intrinsically less efficient, is nonetheless
sufficiently effective that changes in macroscopic photochromic properties
are readily observable.

Introduction
Photochromophores
can be interconverted reversibly between two
(meta)stable states upon irradiation at different wavelengths, usually
as a result of cis-/trans-photoisomerisation and/or photocyclisation.1 Photoresponsive polymers incorporating the azo-group 1 (Figure 1) have found wide application,2 so that
light-modified biosensing,3 self-assembly
behavior,4 and the delivery of bioactive
molecules have all been reported.5,6 Alternatively,
spiropyrans 2a (Figure 1)7,8 have been widely used in organic
photochromic switches for their reversible decolouration–colouration9 since UV photoirradiation gives the ring-opened,
colored merocyanine form 2b, which may revert to the
closed, colorless spiropyran form 2a under visible light
or by thermal relaxation in the dark.10−12 In addition to these
photochromic changes, the conversion of the hydrophilic, zwitterionic,
merocyanine form to the hydrophobic spiropyran form also causes a
significant change in polarity, which is manifested as a change in
surface wetting behavior.13 With their
energetically accessible and kinetically favorable ring opening–ring
closure behavior,14−16 sensitivity, and readily accessible synthesis,17−19 spiropyrans have been used to introduce hydrophobicity and surface
wetting,20−23 electrical switching,24,25 cell binding,26 small molecule binding (e.g., cyanide receptor27,28), and photoresponsive and optical sensor effects,21,29,30 suitable for a wide range of applications.31 Photochromic groups have been used to introduce
light-initiated macroscopic effects into polymers,2,8,19,32−36 but of interest to us was whether surface modification of a polymer
alone provided both the level of loading and stability of chromophore
to achieve a suitably functional material. For such polymer surface
modification, we have shown that substituted diaryldiazomethanes37 and bisdiaryldiazomethanes38 may be used to introduce macroscopic properties, including
visible chromophoric,39 fluorescent,40 biocompatible,41 protein
adhesive,42,43 biocidal,44−46 hydrophobic,47,48 metal chelation,49 co-polymerization,50 crosslinking,44 and
end group51 effects, onto a wide variety
of substrates,45 with a loading of the
diarylmethyl unit onto the material surface of the order of 3 ×
1014 molecules cm–2.37 Although this approach compares favorably to alternatives,5 a key question relates to whether the surface
loading density arising from this type of chemical modification is
sufficient to impart a wider range of observable macroscopic phenomena.
We report here the results of some investigations to apply this process
for the introduction of surface photochromic behavior, in which a
spiropyran moiety is attached to the surface of polymers using a covalent
chemical linkage.

Results and Discussion
Bis(dimethylamino)-
and dimethoxydiaryldiazomethanes (3a,b respectively, Scheme 1) have been found
to be very effective for surface modification,
offering an appropriate balance of reactivity and stability.37 These were readily prepared using the literature
protocol;37 whereas dimethoxydiaryldiazomethane
could be kept for up to 6 months at 0 °C if shielded from light
before use, bis(4-(dimethylamino))diaryldiazomethane needed to be
used more rapidly as it would decompose within 2 weeks under the same
conditions. These materials were dissolved in Et2O and
coated onto XAD4 polystyrene (PS) beads by physisorption by careful
removal of solvent. After heating of the dried physisorbed polymer
to 120 °C, the modified materials, XAD4.A1 and XAD4.A2 (Scheme 1), were
obtained; this reaction proceeds by collapse of the diazo function
with loss of nitrogen gas, to give an intermediate, but highly reactive
carbene.37 A change in color from green
(for 3a) or purple (for 3b) (see Figure 2) to pale yellow
or colorless beads indicated the completion of the surface modification.
For XAD4.A1, yellow colouration of the beads, along with
a UV peak absorbance in reflection of 380 nm, indicated that surface
modification leading to the introduction of aromatic systems had occurred
(Table S1, Supporting Information). Successful
modification was also evident from the IR spectrum, where the new
peaks at 1349 and 1173 cm–1 corresponding to the
C–N bond modified onto the surface were clearly observed. Both
combustion and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis confirmed
the presence of nitrogen, with an estimated surface coverage of (2.1
± 0.5) × 1013 molecules cm–2 for the former, and an N-to-C ratio of 0.0436 for the latter gave
a surface loading value of 37% assuming a monolayer formation. Comparison
of corresponding data for the unmodified starting XAD4 polystyrene
(PS) beads provides clear evidence for successful surface modification
(Table S1, Supporting Information). The
presence of nitrogen provided a very useful marker to demonstrate
qualitatively and quantitatively that surface modification had occurred.

Figure 2 (Left
to right): PS XAD4 beads coated with 3b before,
during thermolysis, and after UV irradiation.

Scheme 1 A variety of diazonium salts was then investigated for
the conjugation
of new chemical functionality onto these preactivated polymers XAD4.Ax (x = 1, 2) and this
gave the surface-modified beads XAD4.Ax–Bx′ (x = 1–2, x′ = 1–5, Scheme 1 and Table S2,
Supporting Information). The diazonium salts were generated from the
required amines 4a–e by stirring with NaNO2 in THF/H2O = 1:1 in acidic conditions at 0 °C
for 30 min and were used in situ; this step was done in the absence
or presence of NaOAc, since buffering has been found to be beneficial
for coupling in some cases.52 Controls
derived from blank XAD4 beads (XAD4.Bx′, x′ = 1–5), which omitted the intermediate
carbene step, were prepared for comparison purposes (Table S2, Supporting Information). The visible color of the
beads gave an immediate indication of modification, and this was confirmed
by diffused reflectance UV–vis (absorbance mode) spectroscopy,
which gave spectra with absorbances less than 520 nm for the most
intensely colored materials. In general, the n → π* transition
of an isolated azo group (R–N = N=R) has λmax around 340 nm,53 but the extra
conjugation of an adjacent aromatic ring leads to a bathochromic shift;
for this reason, all of samples XAD4.A1–Bx′ have λmax greater than 340 nm (Table S2 and Figure S1a,b, Supporting Information).
Importantly, the use of NaOAc gave better azo-coupling efficiency,
as indicated from a hyperchromic effect consistent with a greater
density of chromophores at the polymer surface, an outcome which was
similar to reactions in solution.52 In
some cases, attenuated total reflection-infrared (ATR-IR) spectroscopic
analysis was sufficiently sensitive to give conclusive evidence for
modification (e.g., XAD4.A2–B2 and XAD4.A2–B4 from the presence of a carbonyl group at around 1701 and 1744 cm–1, respectively). Both combustion and XPS analysis
confirmed the presence of nitrogen; the former indicated loading levels
of 4.8 × 1012 up to 3 × 1013 molecules
cm–2, and in the latter a surface loading value
of up to 78% assuming full monolayer formation was observed. The presence
of nitrogen provided a very useful marker to demonstrate qualitatively
and quantitatively that surface modification had occurred in this
step. For beads XAD4.A1, second-stage modification B4 gave the best loading (15%), and B5 the worst
(8.2%), as shown by combustion analysis, and this is also consistent
with the XPS data, which showed that the N to C ratio for XAD4.A1–B4 was 0.0843, whereas that for XAD4.A1–B5 was
0.0215. Both modifications B4 using XAD4.A1 and XAD4.A2 resulted in similar extents of azo coupling,
with estimated surface coverages of the total surface area of 15 and
17% for beads XAD4.A1–B4 and XAD4.A2–B4, respectively.

These activated polymers were reacted further
with alkyl halides 5a,b, prepared by modification of
the literature methodology
starting from 2,3,3-trimethylindolenine (Scheme 2),17,28 by refluxing beads XAD4.Ax–Bx′ with K2CO3, to give the surface-modified materials XAD4.Ax–Bx′–Cx″ (Scheme 1). These were characterized as before by a combination
of UV–vis spectroscopy, ATR-IR, combustion analysis, and XPS
(Table S3, Supporting Information). Intense
visible and UV chromophores and IR absorptions confirmed that the
expected surface derivatization had occurred (e.g., XAD4.A2–B5–C1), although in some cases, color change resulting from hybridization
with spiropyrans 5a,b was not immediately evident (e.g XAD.A2–B4–C1), since the starting beads were
already intensely colored. This was confirmed in the UV–vis
data (Figure S2a, Supporting Information),
where the change in absorbance intensity from XAD4.A2–B4 to XAD4.A2–B4–C1 was only 0.05 at 450
nm, whereas that for XAD4.A2–B5 to XAD4.A2–B5–C1 was about 0.42 at 350 nm. Different side groups on the spiropyran
gave different chromophoric absorptions; thus, surface modification
with a spiropyran containing the NO2 moiety (C1) gave a more purple pink colouration, whereas modification with
the dibromo moieties (C2) gave a green blue, arising
from the different levels of conjugation in the aromatic residues.
This can be seen in the UV–vis spectra (Figure S2a,b, Supporting Information), where peaks for sample XAD4.A2–B5–C1 appeared at 524, 555, and 653
nm and for samples XAD4.A1–B5–C2 at 600
nm. The presence of nitrogen and bromine (where relevant) was indicated
from combustion analysis; quantitation of nitrogen and bromine gave
similar loading values, which were typically in the range of 1012 molecules cm–2. XPS analysis gave further
independent confirmation of the presence of these elements, and gave
surface loading values of up to 70%, assuming full monolayer coverage.
It should be noted that differences in surface loading data between
estimated by combustion analysis or XPS arise because the former includes
nitrogen of the bulk, whereas XPS more nearly estimates the surface
loading. Both values, however, are of value since they provide lower
and upper bounds, respectively, for the estimation of the material
loading after modification. As before, this data taken together confirmed
the success of modification leading to the inclusion of spirocyclic
systems at the surface.

Scheme 2 Substrate Scope
With the general
surface modification
procedure optimized using PS XAD4, the substrate scope was investigated,
and the sequence shown in Scheme 1 was applied to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
pellets, low density polyethylene (LDPE) powder, and ultrahigh-molecular-weight
polyethylene powder (UHMWPE) (Table S4,
Supporting Information); their surface area was determined by Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
analysis (Table S5, Supporting Information).
The low surface area of these materials, along with their lower intrinsic
chemical reactivity when compared to XAD4, was the reason for their
selection for study, and directly impacted upon the observed modification,
which gave weaker color intensity. However, that the modification
had been made was evident for LDPE, which has the highest surface
area of these materials, from UV–vis and ATR-IR spectroscopic
analyses where the expected signals were observed. However, UHMWPE
powder was not useful for ATR-IR characterization due to its large
particle size, although it did give excellent diffused reflectance
UV–vis data (Figure S3a, Supporting
Information), exhibiting a peak at around 350 nm, corresponding to
the azo chromophore. The change in UV–vis spectra of surface-modified
UHMWPE powders could be tracked during the evolution of the surface
modification process from UHMWPE.A2, UHMWPE.A2–B4, and UHMWPE.A2–B4–C1 (Figure S3b, Supporting Information); the peak at around 350
nm is due to the azo chromophore and that around 560 nm for UHMWPE.A2–B4–C1 to the spiropyran, illustrating
the superposition of chromophores in the modified substrates. PET
pellets were difficult to characterize by both ATR-IR spectroscopy
and UV–vis spectrophotometry as a result of sample handling
difficulties due to their large particle size. The ATR-IR spectra
indicated peaks corresponding to the surface modification, in contrast
to the blank polymer (Table S4, Supporting
Information); for example, successful azo coupling for LDPE.A2–B2 was evident with clear C=O peaks at around 1742 cm–1. Elemental combustion analysis characterization, for which N content
was typically below the detection limit of 0.1%, did confirm the presence
of nitrogen in some cases (e.g., PET.A2–B2). XPS
data could be used to estimate surface coverage of the modification;
again LDPE powder gave a better outcome as a result of its higher
surface area, and LDPE.A2–B4 and LDPE.A2–B4–C1 gave an N to C ratio that indicated a surface coverage of approximately
10.2 and 18.5%, respectively.

Having demonstrated the application
of surface modification to these materials, further extension of the
modification strategy (that is, elaboration of the starting material
by application of modifications Ax to Bx′ to Cx″) to flat substrates was made
(Scheme 1 and Table S4, Supporting Information). Flat PS, polycarbonate
(PC), polypropylene (PP), and cyclic olefin co-polymer (COC) were
all produced by injection molding, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU),
and poly(dimethoxysilane) (PDMS) sheets were from solvent casting,
whereas poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(methylmethacrylate)
sheets were commercially available. Because of the larger size of
polymer sample in these cases, the diaryldiazo precursor 3b required for modification A was most conveniently applied as a spray
in a volatile solvent, and its derived carbene was generated via photolysis
using a high intensity UV conveyor belt system; successful achievement
of modification A2 was apparent by a change from opaque
purple of the physisorbed material to a clear yellow color. For modification
B, diazonium salts were synthesized from amines 4a–e in ethanol rather than a mixture of THF and water to avoid polymer
degradation, and the freshly prepared diazonium salt in cold solution
was poured over the substrates and left to stand in an ice bath for
18 h. Modification of C was achieved by treatment with a mixture of
spiropyran 6a,b and K2CO3 in dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) for 5 h. The decolourisation resulting from the initial
carbene insertion was readily apparent in the modification of PDMS
(Figure 3). The ATR-IR,
XPS, and contact angle characterization data for the modified polymers
are given in Table S6 and Figures S4–S10 (Supporting Information), whereas a significant color change was
not always evident after surface modification, ATR-IR and XPS analyses
clearly confirmed the introduction of the expected surface chemical
functionality in all cases. By contrast to powder substrates, water
contact angle (WCA) could be readily monitored, and changes to surface
polarity were readily evident. For example, a decrease of about 5.6°
for WCA was measured for both PET.A2–B2 and PET.A2–B4 relative to PET.A2, and for TPU.A2–B2 and TPU.A2–B4 relative
to TPU.A2, a much greater decrease in angles of 21.4
and 18.5°, respectively, was found, due to the introduction of
a polar COOH group onto the polymer surface (Figure 4). Further modification of TPU.A2–B2 to give TPU.A2–B2–C1 also gave an increase
in WCA as the COOH groups on the TPU surface were further hybridized
with spiropyrans that are not as polar in their closed-ring form.

Photochromicity: Surface
Behavior
Polymers with surface-modified
photochromic spiropyran (Scheme 1) were then investigated for photochromic activity.
XAD4 PS beads proved to be an ideal system for this study, both for
their high surface area and loading, but also their macroscopic form.
XAD4 samples with diamino surface modification A1 (samples XAD4.A1–B4–C1, XAD4.A1–B5–C1, XAD4.A1–B5–C2) generally showed little
change in color before and after UV irradiation, and this was confirmed
from the corresponding UV–vis spectra (Table S7, Supporting Information); this might be due to an
inappropriate chromophore for absorption. However, XAD4.A1–B5–C1 did give a change in color after irradiation (Table S7 and Video S1, Supporting
Information), and in the UV–vis spectrum there was an increase
in absorbance in the region 500–650 nm and especially λmax at around 575 nm. This outcome clearly indicated that a
nitro-substituted spiropyran is superior than the bromo one for visible
photochromic change, and this most likely arises from the greater
conjugation in the former system. Visible color change, however, was
much more apparent for systems with modification A2 (Figure 5 and Table S7 (Supporting Information)), consistent
with a stronger chromophore and/or better coupling efficiency in the
modification protocol. The change in color for XAD4.A2–B5–C1 was particularly apparent, with a clear transformation from pink-to-blue
after UV irradiation, a change which increased with longer irradiation
time and with significant increases in absorbances at 353 and 560
nm in the UV spectrum (Figure S4, Supporting
Information). Although the appearance of XAD4.A2–B5–C2 did not indicate a clear change in color after UV irradiation, absorption
spectra nonetheless showed new peaks at around 350, 554, and 645 nm.
The UV–vis spectra of photochromic spiropyran-modified XAD4
beads showed that change in absorption spectra occurred most significantly
at 500–650 nm, consistent with ring opening of the spiropyran
to give the highly colored merocyanine form.

UV irradiation for 5 s; (c) after UV irradiation for 30 s; (d) upon
relaxation for 60 min.

This outcome was compared to analogous soluble systems 7 and 9, prepared from spiropyran 5a and
phenols 6 and 8 (Scheme 3) and for which solution UV–vis spectra
could be obtained. The spiropyran unit 5a usually displayed
conversion from colorless-to-blue in a change that is clearly solvent-dependent
(Figure S11 and Video S2, Supporting Information) and which arose from increased
absorbance in the region centered around 480–500 nm (Figure S12a,b, Supporting Information). Compounds 7 and 9 gave burgundy-to-blue and pink-to-red
color changes, respectively (Figure S13a,b, Supporting Information), arising from significant changes in intensity
of peaks at 480 and 530, respectively; these solution color changes
mirror those seen on the XAD surface, with the red-to-blue of compound 7 also occurring for XAD4.A2–B5–C1 and therefore providing direct evidence for the formation of the
expected chromophore on the polymer surface. The color change for
compound 9 in solution (Figure S13a,b, Supporting Information) and its solid-phase partner XAD4.A2–B5–C1 was significantly less and illustrates the need for careful optimization
of coupling chemistry and chromophore generation in this methodology.
More importantly, the time for relaxation was significantly different
between solution and surface, being considerably slower on the surface
than in solution (e.g., XAD4.A2–B5–C1 took
more than 1.5 h to relax compared to less than 10 min for the solution
analog 7 and between 30 and 90 s for 9 in
any of ethyl acetate, dichloromethane (DCM), or acetone as solvent).

Scheme 3 For surface-modified PET pellets along with UHMWPE and
LDPE powders,
visible color changes were observable (Figure 6, Table S8 and Figures S14–S16 (Supporting Information)),
and the diffuse reflectance UV–vis spectra (Figure S17a, Supporting Information) gave changes in absorption
between 500 and 680 nm although with poorer signal-noise output, and
this was due to a combination of the lower surface loading and the
physical form of the polymer samples.

Figure 6 Photochromic behavior of surface-modified PET.A2–B5–C1 (samples in 1 cm cuvettes). (a)
Before UV irradiation, (b) after
UV irradiation for 30 s, (c) after relaxation for 30 min.

The suitability of flat substrates for the introduction
of photochromic
behavior, in which surface area was further reduced, was then examined;
these substrates were also amenable to the measurement of water contact
angle (WCA). Some materials showed no significant color change (e.g.,
PET, PP), but the photochromic PDMS and TPU flat substrates showed
evident change in color after UV irradiation (Table S9 and Video S3, Supporting
Information). Although both PDMS.A2–B2–C1 and PDMS.A2–B4–C1 showed a similar decrease
in % T of about 30% at 550 nm in their UV–vis
spectra, WCA measured for the former showed very little change, but
for the latter decreased by 4.6°. The nonuniformity in the surface
modification and photochromic transformation was reflected in the
large ± error in WCA. Photochromic change for TPU.A2–B2–C1 resulted in a decrease in % T of approximately
35% at around 569 nm, whereas TPU.A2–B4–C1 registered a decrease of approximately 50% also around 569 nm; WCA
of TPU.A2–B2–C1 and TPU.A2–B4–C1 decreased by 9.1 and 3.8°. These changes are due to a greater
proportion of the merocyanine form, which is zwitterionic and hence
polar, being present on the surface of the polymer. Of particular
interest is that TPU.A2–B2–C1 could be
run through multiple photochromic activation–relaxation cycles
and without significant loss of water contact angle after 10 cycles
(Figure 7).

Figure 7 Water contact
angle of surface-modified TPU.A2–B2–C1 over
multiple photolysis cycles (even cycle = after UV irradiation,
odd cycle = relaxation). TPU = thermoplastic polyurethane.

Although the visible appearance of surface-modified
PET and COC
did not change before and after UV irradiation, changes in UV–vis
spectra were nonetheless observable (Table S9 and Figure S17b, Supporting Information), which were reflected
in decreases in WCA values measured for the photochromic PET sample.
Similar effects were observed for COC.A2–B2–C1, which gave a decrease in WCA of about 7.5°. This outcome emphasized
that although photochromic change might not be detectable by the naked
eye, the loading of the surface modification was sufficient to bring
about change in WCA and UV–vis absorbance. By contrast, the
UV–vis spectra and WCA of PP were similar before and after
UV irradiation, indicating that surface modification loading was not
sufficient to bring about a detectable photochromic change, and this
is consistent with the chemical inertness of PP.

Overall, this
work has shown that photochromic effects by surface
modification are achievable for a variety of substrates and substrate
forms, although optimization of the modifying carbene and the subsequent
linking and spiropyran modifying steps may be required, depending
upon the underlying polymer substrate.

Conclusions
This
work has shown that a multistep sequential strategy for the
modification of the surface for a variety of polymeric substrates,
mediated, first, by carbene insertion chemistry, second, by diazonium
coupling with a tethered precursor, and finally by coupling to a spiropyran,
enables the introduction of a spiropyran at a surface loading density
sufficient that macroscopic photochromic and light-controllable wettability
phenomena are readily observable. Materials suitable for application
in this process include reactive (e.g., polystyrene, poly(ethylene
terephthalate)), but also lower surface energy polymers (e.g., polyethylene,
polypropylene), which may be in various physical forms (e.g., bead,
pellet, powder, sheet). Although the process is particularly highly
efficient for high surface area materials, surface modification onto
lower surface area substrates is nonetheless sufficiently effective
that changes in macroscopic photochromic properties are readily observable;
importantly, the approach can be applied in batch processing using
thermal carbene activation, or be scaled for large-area processing,
which uses photolytic carbene activation. The photochromic modification,
manifested macroscopically as color and spectroscopic absorption changes
which are significantly slower relative to solution behavior, also
lead to surface polarity changes, as shown by contact angle measurement,
and such changes can be run over multiple cycles without significant
photobleaching or loss of efficacy. Critical is that this outcome
is achieved based upon only surface modification of the substrate
and does not require dispersion into the bulk of the substrate; such
photochromic behavior can be observed at typical surface loading density
of ca 1012–1013 molecules cm–2. This approach compares to noncovalent54 and other covalent55 methodology suitable
for the introduction of optical responsive properties in diverse applications.56,57

All reactions that require
anhydrous conditions
were carried out under nitrogen by standard procedures. All reagents
and solvents were purchased from commercial suppliers and were used
without further treatment, except for dry THF, which was obtained
by passing through a dry alumina column. Analytical thin layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed whenever possible with Merck aluminum foil backed
TLC sheets, precoated with silica gel 60 F254 and layer thickness
of 0.2 mm, and visualized under UV fluorescence (λmax = 254 nm). Silica gel flash columns were performed on Merck Geduran
60 (0.040–0.063 mm) mesh silica gel. 1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, and DEPT-135 spectra were recorded on either a Bruker
DPX200 (200 MHz) or AVF400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. Chemical shifts
(δ) are reported in parts per million (ppm) relative to various
solvent residual peaks and coupling constants in hertz (Hz). Low-resolution
mass spectra were obtained on a Fison Platform spectrometer with electrospray
ionization (ESI). High-resolution mass spectra were obtained on a
Bruker microTOF spectrometer, all reported in Daltons. For compounds
in solid, liquid, or oil form, IR spectra were obtained using a Bruker
Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrometer. Absorption maxima (νmax) are reported in wavenumbers (cm–1) with selected
peaks reported. Melting points were measured using a Stuart Scientific
SMP1 melting point instrument. Surface analyses of various modified
substrates were performed through ATR-IR, performed on a Bio-Rad FTS-6000
with a diamond stage accessory. Combustion analysis was performed
by MEDAC Ltd (www.medacltd.com). Solid-state -diffused reflectance UV–vis and solution absorbance
UV–vis was performed on Agilent Cary 4000 UV Vis Spectrometer.
Pike Veemac Diffuse IR accessory was used with the Spectrometer for
Diffused Reflectance UV–vis measurements.

Polymer Modification
General
Method (C): Polymer Surface Modification
For
a 20 w/w % loading, the diaryldiazo compound (1.00 g) was suspended
in Et2O and swirled in the dark. Blank polymers (∼5.00
g) were added into the suspension and swirled for homogenous coverage
of the beads with the compound. Solvent was removed carefully and
slowly in vacuo. The flask was heated to 120 °C for 30 min (or
until all of the beads have changed color), then cooled to room temperature.
The beads were washed thoroughly with acetone and water until no color
was observed to be washed out.

General method (D): Coupling
of Diazonium Salt Compounds on
Modified Surface of Polymers
Functionalized polymers (∼2.50
g) were added into the diazonium salt suspension (∼375 mg in
10 mL solvent) at 0 °C and swirled in the dark. The mixture was
then left in the fridge at 4 °C to stand for 18–20 h.
The polymers were filtered and washed thoroughly with acetone and
water until no color was observed to be washed out [15 w/w % loading:
assuming 80% conversion of amines to diazonium salts from General
Method (B)]

General Method (E): Hybridization of Modified
Polymers with
Spiropyran
For a 10 w/w % loading, functionalized polymers
from General Method (D) (∼1 g) were refluxed with 6a (100 mg) and K2CO3 in MeCN for 5 h. The mixture
was then cooled to room temperature. The polymers were then filtered
and washed thoroughly with acetone and water until no color was observed
to be washed out (alternatively, polymers were stirred in 6b with K2CO3 for 18 h in acetone or DMSO at
room temperature).

Procedure for Photochromic Activity Measurement
For
Solution
The photochromic compound was first dissolved
in the solvent and left to stand in light for at least 1 h. The solution
was transferred carefully into a quartz vial using a syringe. UV–vis
absorbance data were measured. The quartz vial containing the solution
was carefully transferred to the UV box for UV irradiation at 360–375
nm for 1 min and transferred immediately back to the UV–vis
spectrophotometer for absorbance measurement.

For Beads,
Pellets, Powders
The sample was first transferred
carefully into the small sample holder for the diffused reflectance
accessory. A UV–vis diffused reflectance spectrum was recorded.
The sample holder was transferred from the UV–vis spectrophotometer
to the UV box where the photochromic sample was exposed to UV irradiated
at 360–375 nm for 1 min. The sample holder was then transferred
immediately back to the UV–vis spectrophotometer for diffused
reflectance measurement.

For Flat Samples
UV–vis transmittance spectrum
for photochromic flat substrates was first collected. The sample was
UV irradiated at 360–375 nm for 1 min and transferred back
to the UV–vis spectrophotometer for another transmittance measurement.
