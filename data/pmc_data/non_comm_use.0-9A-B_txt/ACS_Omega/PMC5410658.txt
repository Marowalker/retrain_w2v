Infections
are a devastating complication of titanium alloy orthopedic
implants. Current therapies include antibiotic-impregnated bone cement
and antibiotic-containing coatings. Daptomycin (DAP) (1) is a novel peptide antibiotic that penetrates the cell membranes
of Gram-positive bacteria. Few DAP-resistant strains have appeared
so far. We hypothesized that when DAP covalently bonded via a flexible,
hydrophilic spacer it could prevent bacterial colonization of titanium
alloy surfaces. We designed and synthesized a series of DAP conjugates
for bonding to the surface of Ti6Al4V foils through tetra(ethylene
glycol) spacers via thioether linkages. The stability and antimicrobial
activity of the attached conjugates were evaluated using Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. Colonization of
the Ti6Al4V foils was inhibited by 72% at 8 h and 54% at 24 h. The
strategy described in this report provides a new, more facile way
to prepare bactericidal Ti6Al4V implants.

1 Introduction
Orthopedic implants, oral
implants, heart valves, and stents have
extended the life span and improved the quality of life of patients.1 However, implant-associated infections are serious
problems in clinical practice.2 Implant-associated
infections may be introduced at the time of surgery by contiguous
spread from overlying wound infections or hematogenous spread from
systemic infections. Bacterial biofilms substantially raise minimum
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of rifampicin, vancomycin, and tigecycline.3 The measures taken for surgery, such as the prophylactic
use of antibiotics, ultraclean air in the operating room, and careful
patient selection, have decreased the rate of infection.4 The overall incidence of implant infection is
in the range of 1–3%.4 Once the
implant is determined to be infected, the standard protocol requires
complete removal of all foreign material, identification of the infecting
organism, prolonged systemic application of antibiotics, and finally
reimplantation of the prosthesis.5,6

Antibacterial
modifications of the implant surface have been developed
as additional preventive measures to avoid the side effect of a prolonged
systemic antibiotic application and decrease the incidence of implant-associated
infections. Antibiotics, antiseptics, and silver have been used in
local delivery systems, such as antimicrobial coatings, cements, and
membranes.7,8 The antimicrobials are released from the
implant surface to provide a local level exceeding usual systemic
antibiotic concentrations by several orders of magnitude. Nevertheless,
the antimicrobial coating, cement, and membrane systems can release
antimicrobials only for a limited time, and at some point in time,
these delivery systems must be removed by surgery.2

The covalent attachments of the antimicrobials to
the surfaces
of implants have been investigated as a strategy to provide permanent
self-protection from infection to the implants. Quaternary ammonium
salts, such as poly(4-vinyl-N-alkylpyridinium bromide)
and 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride,
were covalently bounded to the biomaterial surface to provide bactericidal
activity.9,10 Ampicillin, a broad spectrum suicide inhibitor,
has been used to modify the surface of poly(tetrafluoroethylene) to
establish surface antibiotic activity.11,12

The
antimicrobial peptide, LL-37, has also been attached to the
surfaces of the titanium alloy implants to prevent infections.13,14 Such peptides display broad-spectrum activity against bacteria and
fungi through peptide–membrane interactions, leading to membrane
permeation.

We previously reported the covalent modification
of titanium powder
and Ti6Al4V alloy pins by vancomycin, a Gram-positive peptide antibiotic
that blocks peptidoglycan cross-linking15 via a flexible, hydrophilic spacer.16,17 The surfaces
of the Ti6Al4V alloy pins were first uniformly oxidized with a hydrogen
peroxide/sulfuric acid mixture, then functionalized with aminopropyltriethyoxysilane.
After amide bonding of the two aminoethoxyethoxyacetates to surface
aminopropyl groups, vancomycin was coupled to the Ti6Al4V alloy surface
via a third amide bond. The covalently attached vancomycin prevented Staphylococcus aureus(18) and Staphylococcus epidermidis(19) colonization and biofilm formation on the Ti6Al4V
alloy surfaces. The covalently attached vancomycin synergized with
rifampicin in solution and blocked the selection for rifampicin-resistant
mutants.20 Nevertheless, resistance to
vancomycin is becoming more prevalent.21,22

Treatment
with daptomycin (DAP) (1) (Scheme 1), a recently discovered antibacterial
cyclic lipopeptide,23 might be more efficacious
due to lack of resistant organisms so far. DAP appears to function
by penetrating the bacterial cell membrane and causing rapid depolarization,
resulting in a loss of membrane potential, leading to the inhibition
of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, thereby killing the bacteria.24 We demonstrated that when DAP covalently attached
via a bisphosphonate linker to tetra(ethylene glycol) (TEG) extended
from the Ti6Al4V surface it killed 53% of a high-challenge dose of
3 × 105 cfu Staphylococcus aureus.(25) TEG served as a flexible, hydrophilic
spacer to increase freedom of motion and elevate DAP off the titanium
alloy surface. In this report, we covalently attached DAP via a thioether
linker to TEG extended from the Ti6Al4V surface, taking a simpler
route than before. The DAP-thioether-modified Ti6Al4V foils were protected
against S. aureus colonization by 72%
at 8 h.

2 Materials
and Methods
2.1 Materials
All reagents and solvents
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), except for DAP
(1) (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA), 2-(7-aza-1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyl-uronium hexafluorophosphate
(HATU) (Novabiochem, San Diego, CA), Mueller–Hinton broth (Becton-Dickinson,
Sparks, MD), maleimidyl-dPEG-succinimidyl ester (Quantum Biodesign,
Powell, OH), and Ti6Al4V foils (Goodfellow, Oakdale, PA).

2.2 Apparatus
Mass spectra were recorded
on an Ettan matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
(MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometer (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) and
a SciEx 4800 MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA). Lyophilization was performed using a Sentry freeze-dryer
(Virtis, Gardiner, NY) equipped with a Savant Vacuum Pump (Holbrook,
NY). Fluorescence readings were recorded on a PTI fluorimeter (Photon
Technology International, Birmingham, NJ). Altima C18 5
μm reversed phase columns of 10 × 250 mm2 and
22 × 250 mm2 (Alltech, Deerfield, IL) were used as
analytical and semipreparative columns, respectively. Columns were
eluted with linear gradients delivered by a Waters 600E dual pump
liquid chromatograph monitored by a Waters 486 absorbance detector
(Waters, Waltham, MA).

2.3 Methods
2.3.1 N-Cys-DAP (2) (Scheme 1)
To a solution of
231.8 mg (0.5 mmol) of Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH in 5 mL of
EtOAc were added 1 equiv of NHS and N,N′-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). The mixture was stirred
at rt for 2 h, and the reaction was monitored by thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) on Merck 60 F254 silica gel plates developed with dichloromethane
(DCM)/MeOH as the development solvent. After filtering out the N,N′-dicyclohexylurea precipitate,
the filtrate was concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residual
solid was used for the next reaction step without purification.

To a solution of 100 mg (62 μmol) of DAP in 1 mL of DMF was
added 1.1 equiv of Boc-Cys(Trt)-succinimidyl ester (38 mg, 68 μmol).
The mixture was stirred at rt overnight. The product was precipitated
with 1 vol of Et2O. The precipitate was deprotected with
4 mL of CF3CO2H/H2O/EDT (90:5:5)
at rt for 15 min. The deprotected product was collected by precipitation
with Et2O and then purified by high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC), with a 30 min linear gradient from 30 to 75%
CH3CN in aqueous 0.1% CF3CO2H on
a 22 × 250 mm2 C18 column, and detected
at 254 nm. The eluent corresponding to the product was pooled, concentrated,
and lyophilized. The purified sample was characterized by analytical
HPLC (Figure 1A) and
MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Figure 2).

2.3.2 N-Dansyl-Cys(Trt)-OH
(3) (Scheme 2)
To a solution of fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-Cys(Trt)-OH
(585.7 mg, 1 mmol) in 3.2 mL of DMF was added 0.8 mL of piperidine
to remove the Fmoc group. The mixture was stirred at rt for 15 min,
and the solvent was removed. The residue was dissolved in 4 mL of
DCM containing 2 mmol of iPr2NEt, followed by the dropwise
addition of dansyl chloride (405 mg, 1.5 mmol) dissolved in 4 mL of
DCM. The reaction mixture was stirred at rt for 3 h, and the reaction
was monitored by TLC on Merck 60 F254 silica gel plates developed
with 3% MeOH/97% DCM. Once the starting material disappeared, the
solvent was removed by rotary evaporation.

The residue was dissolved
in 25 mL of DCM, and the resulting solution was washed three times
with water. The organic phase was dried with Na2SO4, then purified by flash chromatography on silica gel 60 (70–230
mesh) eluted with 3% MeOH/97% DCM. The eluent corresponding to the
product was pooled, the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation,
and the solid product was dried under vacuum overnight. The product
was characterized by analytical HPLC (Figure 1B) and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Figure 2).

2.3.3 N-(Dansyl-Cys)-DAP (4) (Scheme 2)
N-Dansyl-Cys(Trt)-OH
(55.2 mg, 92 μmol)
and NHS (10.7 mg, 93 μmol) were dissolved in 2 mL of EtOAc,
followed by the addition of DCC (19.1 mg, 93 μmol). The reaction
was carried out at rt and monitored by TLC until the starting material
disappeared. The precipitate was filtered off, and the filtrate was
concentrated to dryness. The active ester was used without further
purification to couple with DAP.

The active ester was dissolved
in 2 mL of DMF followed by the addition of 100 mg (62 μmol)
of DAP. The reaction was performed at rt overnight. The product was
collected by ether precipitation. The precipitate was dried under
vacuum, and the dry sample was incubated with CF3CO2H/H2O/EDT (90:5:5) for 15 min. The product was
precipitated by Et2O and purified by reversed phase C18 HPLC. The purified sample was pooled, concentrated, and
lyophilized. The dry sample was characterized by analytical HPLC (Figure 1C) and MALDI-TOF
mass spectroscopy (Figure 3).

2.3.4 Passivation of Ti6Al4V Foils (Scheme 3)
Ti6Al4V foils (10
× 10 × 0.06 cm3) were cut into 1 × 1 cm2 pieces. The foils were cleaned with (a) 1 M NaOH at rt for
5 min, then with (b) MeOH/concentrated HCl (1:1) at rt for 30 min
with intermittent sonication. The foils were then washed with (c)
distilled water five times and passivated with (d) 30% H2O2/concentrated H2SO4 (1:1) for
4 h with intermittent shaking at 0 °C. Finally, the foils were
washed with (e) double-deionized water, DMF, then double-deionized
water. The passivated material was dried under vacuum overnight.

Scheme 3 Preparation of DAP-Modified Foils
Reagents: (i) APTS (5%) in toluene,
100°C, 4 h; (ii) Fmoc-TEG-COOH, HATU, DIPEA in DMF, rt, 2 h;
(iii) piperidine (20%) in DMF, 20 min; (iv) iodoacetic anhydride,
DMF, rt, 2 h; and (v) DAP derivative, DMF, rt, 2 h.

2.3.5 Silanization of the Surface of Ti6Al4V (Scheme 3)
The passivated
material was incubated with 5% (v/v) aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS)
in anhydrous toluene (under argon) for 4 h at 100 °C. After removal
of the reaction mixture by filtration, Ti6Al4V was washed with toluene,
then DMF, followed by water (5 times); the foils were dried overnight
under vacuum and then baked at 110 °C for 30 min under the protection
of argon.

2.3.6 Quantification of Amino
Groups on the Modified
Ti6Al4V Surface
The amino groups on the surface of Ti6Al4V
foils were estimated by reaction with dansylglycine in the presence
of HATU and diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) in DMF. The attached dansylglycine
was cleaved by incubating the modified foils in 0.01 M aqueous sodium
hydroxide at rt for 3 h. The fluorescence released into the solution
was recorded with a PTI fluorimeter at λex = 337
nm and λem = 520 nm. The amount of dansylglycine
in the solution was calculated using a standard curve of dansylglycine
at λex = 337 nm and λem = 520 nm
(Figure 4).

λex = 337 nm, λem = 520 nm.

2.3.7 Functionalization
of the Silanized Surface
of Ti6Al4V with TEG (Scheme 3)
The amino groups on the surface of Ti6Al4V foils
were coupled twice with 0.2 M Fmoc-TEG-COOH in anhydrous DMF with
HATU and DIPEA to activate the coupling. The reaction was carried
out at rt for 2 h with intermittent shaking. The foils were deprotected
in 20% piperidine in DMF for 20 min and washed extensively with DMF,
then dried under vacuum and stored in a freezer.

2.3.8 Iodoacetylation (Scheme 3)
Iodoacetic anhydride was prepared
from a solution of iodoacetic acid in ethyl acetate in the presence
of DCC. After stirring at rt for 2 h, the precipitate was removed
by filtration and the solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator.
The resulting iodoacetic anhydride was used in the next reaction without
purification. Ti6AlV4 foils functionalized with TEG were incubated
with 0.1 M iodoacetic anhydride in DMF at rt for 2 h with intermittent
shaking. The foils were washed three times with DMF and water, respectively,
then dried under vacuum and stored in a freezer.

2.3.9 Attachment of N-Dansyl
Cysteine to the Iodoacetylated Titanium Surface (Scheme 3)
Iodoacetylated titanium
foils were incubated with N-dansyl cysteine in DMF
(2 mg/mL) at rt for 2 h with intermittent shaking. After incubation,
the foils were collected by filtration, washed with DMF and water,
then stored in the freezer for use in the next step.

2.3.10 Attachment of N-Cys-DAP
(2) to the Iodoacetylated Ti6Al4V Surface (Scheme 3)
The foils with iodoacetyl
groups were incubated with N-Cys-DAP (2 mg/mL) at
rt in DMF for 2 h under the protection of argon. The foils were then
washed with DMF and water, dried under vacuum, and stored in the freezer. N-Dansyl-Cys-DAP (4) was coupled to iodoacetylated
Ti6Al4V foils using the same protocol used for N-Cys-DAP
(2). The loading was investigated using the same protocol
described in Quantification of amino groups on the modified Ti6Al4V
surface. The standard fluorescence plot of N-dansyl-Cys-DAP
(4) is shown in Figure 4.

2.3.11 MIC of DAP Derivatives
The MIC
of N-Cys-DAP (2) versus DAP was investigated
using the methodology described by CLSI for broth microdilution testing
of aerobic Gram-positive organisms,26 using Staphylococcus aureus strain 25923 (ATCC, Germantown,
MD). The experiment was carried out in Mueller–Hinton broth
supplemented with 50 mg/L calcium chloride, according to the Cubist
Pharmaceuticals protocol, at a final S. aureus titer of 5 × 105 cfu/mL, using DAP (1) as the positive control.

2.3.12 Inhibition
of Bacterial Colonization on
the Modified Ti6Al4V Surface
The modified and nonmodified
control Ti6Al4V foils were sterilized in 75% EtOH at rt for 30 min.
After drying in a biological safety hood, the foils were incubated
in 1 mL of calcium-supplemented (50 mg/L) Mueller–Hinton broth
containing 5 × 105S. aureus cfu, a large challenge dose, in a 24-well plate. The foils were
incubated at 37 °C for 2, 4, 8, and 24 h. Following incubation,
the foils were washed seven times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS),
then stained for 20 min at rt with a Live/Dead BacLight Kit (Invitrogen,
Eugene, Oregon) to visualize live bacteria through green fluorescence.
The stained foils were washed three times with PBS to remove the nonabsorbed
dye, then imaged on a CK40 fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Japan)
interfaced with an RT digital color camera (Diagnostic Instruments
Ltd, MI). Live green fluorescent bacterial colonies on the surface
of Ti6Al4V foils were processed to colorized three-dimensional (3D)
images and counted using Image Pro Plus 4.5 (Media Cybernetics, Inc.,
Bethesda, MD). Three independent batches of foils were incubated and
analyzed.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Preparation of DAP Derivatives
DAP
is a lipopeptide antibiotic with five free carboxylic acid groups
and one amino group. Acylation of the amino group did not significantly
reduce the bioactivity of DAP.27 Because
DAP exerts its bactericidal activity at the bacterial membrane, it
is important to maintain the mobility of DAP and its accessibility
after attachment to the surface of Ti6Al4V. On the basis of our experience
with attaching vancomycin to Ti6Al4V surfaces functionalized with
APTS and a TEG spacer,16 we designed a
route for coupling N-Cys-DAP to iodoacetylated Ti6Al4V
(Scheme 1). Under this
protocol, modification began with the amino group of DAP introducing
a sulfhydryl group, which enabled specific coupling with the iodoacetylated
Ti6Al4V surface in the presence of several other functional groups,
such as amines or carboxylates.

Boc-Cys(Trt)-OH was first reacted
with NHS to form an active ester, which was coupled to DAP in DMF.
The reaction was complete after 4 h at rt; no significant side reaction
was found after the overnight reaction. Precipitation with Et2O removed most of the small-molecule impurities. The precipitate
was redissolved in CF3CO2H/H2O/EDT
(90:5:5) under anhydrous argon to remove the Boc-protecting group
and give N-Cys-DAP (2) a free amino
and sulfhydryl group (Scheme 2).

3.2 Ti6Al4V Surface Modification
and Characterization
Most metallic implant materials are
made of titanium and its alloys
because of their biocompatibility and osseointegrating ability.28 To covalently attach antibiotics, the Ti6Al4V
surfaces were functionalized with APTS to introduce amino groups.
A flexible, hydrophilic TEG spacer was coupled to the amino group
to extend DAP away from the metal surface. Iodoacetylation then provided
the specific functional group necessary to conjugate with N-Cys-DAP. The density of amino groups on the surface was
estimated by the attachment of N-dansyl-Cys to the
surface, followed by hydrolysis with 0.01 M NaOH.

The released
dansyl fluorescence was recorded, and the density of surface amines
was calculated from a standard curve (Figure 4). The surface density of amino groups fell
in the range of 0.3–0.6 nmol/cm2. Covalently bonded N-dansyl-Cys-DAP (4) was stripped with 0.01
M NaOH, as above. The density of N-dansyl-Cys-DAP
(4) on the Ti6Al4V surfaces varied over a range of 0.05–0.2
nmol/cm2 (Table 1). The foil loading results imply that 2 mg/mL dansyl-Cys-DAP
is sufficient to obtain maximum bonding.

 	4	49160.0	0.1620	
 	8	20837.6	0.0609	
These results agree
with other reports of Ti6Al4V surface modification.29 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy is regarded
as the standard method to estimate the surface density of functional
groups.30 Radiolabeling was also reported
to modify the APTS-functionalized Ti6Al4V surface for estimation of
the amino groups attached.29 Fluorescence
labeling does not need special instruments and is environment-friendly,
so it has been used by several research groups to check the density
of amine after silanization.17

The
titanium–oxygen–silicon bond is stable at rt
under physiological conditions. However, the bond is labile to 0.01
M NaOH. The covalently bonded fluorescence could be released under
this basic condition. There are several factors influencing the results
of amino density estimations. The efficiency of fluorescence coupling,
nonspecific binding, and low quantum efficiency of dansyl contributed
to experimental variability. The variations suggest that passivation,
aminopropylation, or TEG attachment are not yet optimized, perhaps
due to the biphasic system of Ti6Al4V foil and organic solvents.

3.3 Inhibitory Activity of DAP Immobilized on
the Ti6Al4V Surface
The MICs of DAP and N-Cys-DAP (2) were investigated using a standard protocol26 modified by Cubist Pharmaceuticals by the addition
of 50 mg/L calcium chloride, with pure DAP (1) as the
positive control, displaying an MIC of 0.2 μg/mL. N-Cys-DAP (2) yielded an MIC of 2.0 μg/mL, illustrating
some loss of activity upon modification.

The target of DAP is
the cell membrane of bacteria. Although the chemically modified N-Cys-DAP (2) lost a log of activity in solution,
the simultaneous binding of thousands of N-Cys-DAPs
to the surface of each docking bacterium could enable cooperative
inhibition of bound bacterium. Considering the high local concentration
of N-Cys-DAP bonded to the surface of modified Ti6Al4V
via a long spacer, the DAP derivative might still have sufficient
affinity to inhibit the colonization of bacteria on the surface because
the attached antibiotics have a high density on the two-dimensional
surface of Ti6Al4V, enabling interaction with multiple sites on the
surfaces of each bacterial cell.

N-Cys-DAP
(2) attached to the Ti6Al4V
surface visibly inhibited colonization due to the large challenge
dose of 5 × 105S. aureus at 8 and 24 h (Figure 5). Quantitation and integration of green fluorescence (Table 2) revealed 72% inhibition at
8 h and 54% inhibition at 24 h. In clinical practice, S. aureus challenges to implants fall in the range
of 100–10 000 cfu.31 The
high challenge dose used here was a demanding test of the system.

Figure 5 Inhibition

surfaces. The foils were incubated at 37 °C. Colonization of
bacteria on the surface of Ti6Al4V foils was recorded after 2, 4,
8, and 24 h incubation. Following incubation, the foils were washed
seven times with PBS, then stained for 20 min at rt with a live/dead
BacLight kit to visualize live bacteria by green fluorescence, with
nonmodified Ti6Al4V foils as the controls. Three independent sets
of foils were analyzed. Representative fluorescence surface plots
of colonies, processed to appear as 3D colorized peaks, are shown
at 40× magnification.

a Colonies from all
three independent
batches were stained with a live/dead BacLight kit. Live green fluorescent
bacterial colonies on the surface of the Ti6Al4V foils were imaged
on a CK40 fluorescence microscope and counted using Image Pro Plus
4.5.

Even in the unlikely
event that all DAP attached to the surface
were released into the broth, for which no mechanism is apparent,
the concentration of N-Cys-DAP in solution would
be far below the MIC. Thus, the observed inhibitory effect can be
attributed to the surface-immobilized N-Cys-DAP.
Future studies with an animal implant infection model will provide
insight into the potential effectiveness of DAP-modified titanium
alloy implants in clinical practice.

4 Conclusions
We designed and prepared DAP derivatives for modification of the
Ti6Al4V foil surfaces to create self-protecting bactericidal implants.
Fluorescently labeled DAP was also synthesized and used to quantify
the amount of DAP bonded to the Ti6Al4V surface. The MIC data showed
that cysteine-modified DAP maintained antibiotic activity, lowered
by 1 log. The antibiotic activity of DAP immobilized on the
metal was visualized by fluorescence microscopy after vital staining,
revealing 72% inhibition at 8 h and 54% inhibition at 24 h. The strategy
described in this report provides a new way to prepare bactericidal
implants.
