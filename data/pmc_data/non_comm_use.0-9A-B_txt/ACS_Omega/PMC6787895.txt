A thermoresponsive ABA triblock copolymer
bearing an aldehyde group
on the thermoresponsive A segments was synthesized. The polymer formed
a micellar assembly due to the hydrophobic interactions of the thermoresponsive
segment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST). In contrast,
the ABA polymer assembly decomposed upon lowering the temperature
below the LCST. Using this structural change, the reactivity of the
aldehyde group toward primary amines of albumin and poly(allylamine)
was investigated. When the ABA polymer assembly and reactant were
mixed above the LCST, Schiff base formation was suppressed because
of the aldehyde group being protected by the hydrophobic thermoresponsive
core. In contrast, Schiff base formation between the ABA triblock
copolymer and the primary amine moiety on the molecules was confirmed
below the LCST. The reactivity of the aldehyde functional group can
therefore be controlled by altering the structure of the thermoresponsive
ABA polymer.

1 Introduction
The
physicochemical properties and structures of thermoresponsive
polymers can be altered in response to a heat signal.1,2 For example, thermoresponsive polymers with a lower critical solution
temperature (LCST) can form random hydrophilic coils below the LCST,
while hydrophobic aggregates are produced above the LCST because of
dehydration.3 By applying thermoresponsive
polymers to material production, the physicochemical properties of
the resulting materials can also be controlled in response to temperature
changes across the LCST. As such, thermoresponsive materials have
been widely applied to control the interactions with substances, such
as cells and proteins, through temperature variations.4−7 In particular, the physicochemical properties of nanoparticles modified
with thermoresponsive polymers can be controlled,8−10 and so such
systems are currently being developed as drug carriers for controlling
the interactions between the incorporated drugs and the cells.11−13

ABA triblock copolymers possessing LCST-type thermoresponsive
properties
on the A segments and a hydrophilic polymer on B segment have been
used to prepare thermoresponsive nanoparticles.14,15 Because the presence of thermoresponsive segments increases the
degree of hydrophobic interactions above the LCST, ABA polymers form
a flower-like micelle consisting of a thermoresponsive core. In contrast,
above the LCST, the hydrophobic interactions between thermoresponsive
segments are relaxed, and the assembled structure can be dissociated.16,17 This structural change occurs reversibly by altering the temperature
across the LCST, and so can be employed in nanoparticles prepared
from thermoresponsive ABA polymers to control the release of molecules
incorporated in the hydrophobic inner core.18 In addition, highly concentrated ABA-type thermoresponsive polymers
exhibit sol–gel transitions upon varying the temperature, thereby
leading to the development of thermoresponsive injectable gels for
biomedical applications.19−21

Furthermore, the abovedescribed
structural change of a thermoresponsive
ABA polymer can be used to control the interactions between thermoresponsive
segments and external molecules. As the ABA polymer assembly possesses
a hydrophilic polymer on its shell, the interactions between the hydrophobic
inner core (composed of the thermoresponsive polymer) and a nanomolecule
such as protein can be suppressed because of the exclusion volume
effect of the corona-forming hydrophilic polymer.22 In contrast, an ABA polymer assembly can be dissociated
by lowering the temperature below the LCST. Thus, the hydrated thermoresponsive
segment is exposed and can come into contact with external molecules.
By utilizing the localization change of this thermoresponsive polymer
in aqueous media, the interactions between the thermoresponsive segment
and the external molecules can be controlled by varying the temperature
across the LCST. An ABA polymer possessing a reactive functional group
on the thermoresponsive segment can therefore control the reactivity
of the introduced functional group through the temperature-dependent
structural change of the polymer, and so can be applied in the context
of a thermoresponsive molecule reactor.

Thus, we herein report
the preparation of thermoresponsive ABA
triblock polymers possessing an aldehyde group on their thermoresponsive
A segments (Scheme 1). Because aldehyde groups can form Schiff bases by reaction with
the primary amines present on molecules,23,24 using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and viscoelastic changes, we
investigate the formation of a Schiff base by the aldehyde group in
a thermoresponsive ABA triblock polymer and primary amine of albumin
and poly(allylamine) across the LCST. Finally, we investigate a suitable
method for controlling the reactivity of the aldehyde functional group
through the temperature-responsive structural change of the thermoresponsive
triblock copolymer.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Preparation of P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)
S-1-Dodecyl-S′-(α,α′-dimethyl-α″-acetic
acid)-trithiocarbonate (DDMAT), the chain transfer agent of reversible
addition–fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization,
was conjugated to the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydroxyl groups
at both termini through a condensation reaction. The resulting terminal
conversion efficiency was confirmed by 1H NMR measurements
of the proton signals derived from PEG ethylene (−CH2CH2O) (4H, 3.4–3.9 ppm) and
DDMAT methylene (S(C=S)S–CH2−) (4H, 3.2–3.3 ppm), and was
determined to be ∼86% (Figure S1).

Thermoresponsive segments bearing succinimide units were
connected by the random copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide
(NIPAAm) and N-acryloxysuccinimide (NAS) using DDMAT–PEG–DDMAT
as the macro-RAFT agent. From the resulting 1H NHR spectrum,
the proton signals derived from NIPAAm methyne (−CH–(CH3) (1H, 3.9–4.1 ppm), NAS
ethylene (−C(=O)–CH2–CH2−) (4H, 2.8–2.9 ppm), and PEG ethylene
(−CH2CH2O) (4H, 3.4–3.9
ppm) moieties were clearly assigned (Figure S2). The conversion of NIPAAm and NAS was 55 and 77.5%, respectively.
The numbers of NIPAAm and NAS units were calculated from the proton
intensity of each signal and were determined to be 198 and 31, respectively.
The polymer termini were then converted to the inert isobutyronitrile
group by a radical reaction using Perrier’s method.25 After the radical treatment, the polymer color
changed from yellow to white, and the UV absorbance of the DDMAT unit
at 310 nm was no longer observed (data not shown). In addition, gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) measurements showed that the radical-treated
triblock polymer exhibited a unimodal peak at a similar retention
time to the triblock copolymer prior to the reaction (Figure 1C). The obtained thermoresponsive
ABA triblock copolymer, P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-NAS),
was abbreviated as ABA(NAS).

(C) ABA(acetal), and (D) ABA(aldehyde[7]).

2.2 Preparation of the Aldehyde-Containing Thermoresponsive
ABA Triblock Copolymer
We then converted the succinimide
group on the side chain of the NAS unit on ABA(NAS) into an aldehyde
group. For this purpose, an acetal group was initially introduced
into the thermoresponsive segment by the amino coupling of N,N-diethoxyethylamine (DEEA) to succinimide.
From the GPC chromatogram, it was apparent that the peak shape was
comparable to that of ABA(NAS) (Figure 1). In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum showed
the complete disappearance of the succinimide (−C(=O)–CH2–CH2−) (4H, 2.8–2.9 ppm)
peak, and the appearance of the methyne proton of the acetal unit
(−CH–(O–CH2–CH3)2) (1H, 4.5–4.7 ppm)
(Figure S3). The acetal-containing triblock
copolymer, P(NIPAAm-co-DEEAm)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-DEEAm) (DEEAm: diethoxyethylacrylamide)
was abbreviated as ABA(acetal).

Subsequently, ABA(acetal) was
dialyzed against sodium acetate buffer (pH 5), followed by treatment
with hydrochloric acid (pH 2) to convert the acetal group into an
aldehyde group. This transformation was confirmed by the observation
of a peak corresponding to the aldehyde group at 9.7–9.9 ppm
(Figure 2). Upon increasing
the duration of hydrochloric acid treatment, it was found that the
conversion to aldehyde groups increased. The aldehyde conversion proceeded
by ∼25 and 57% after the hydrochloric acid treatment for 5
and 24 h. Analysis by GPC showed that the obtained polymers exhibited
a similar peak to ABA(acetal) (Figure 1D). In the experiment, the acetal unit was converted
to aldehyde by the acid treatment. Although triblock copolymer possessed
ester bonds between PEG and thermoresponsive segments, no possible
hydrolysis was observed in the GPC chromatograms. Hydrolysis was observed
in the presence of basic molecules during the hydrolysis (Figure S5). In this method, basic molecules such
as triethylamine were completely removed before the hydrochloric acid
treatment by dialysis using sodium acetate for 3 days. Owing to pretreatment,
possible hydrolysis of the ester bond was successfully avoided during
the aldehyde conversion.

The obtained polymer, P(NIPAAm-co-DEEAm-co-N-2-formylmethylacrylamide)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-DEEAm-co-N-2-formylmethylacrylamide) was abbreviated
as ABA(aldehyde[x]); where x indicates
the number of N-2-formylmethylacrylamide units on
a single thermoresponsive segment. Characterization of the synthesized
polymers is summarized in Table 1.

2.3 Characterization of the ABA Triblock Copolymers
The phase transition behavior of the triblock copolymers was then
investigated by measuring the change in turbidity of the polymer solution
(Figure 3). The phase
transition temperature (Tp) values of
ABA(acetal), ABA(aldehyde[7]), and ABA(aldehyde[16]) were determined
as 32.5, 37.1, and 42.2 °C, respectively. It was found that Tp increased upon the introduction of aldehyde
units on the thermoresponsive unit. As Tp of an NIPAAm copolymer tends to increase upon copolymerization with
a hydrophilic co-monomer,26 the greater
hydrophilicity of the aldehyde group compared to that of DEEAm results
in the LCST of the thermoresponsive chain increasing upon the introduction
of an aldehyde unit.

Figure 3 Turbidity changes for the thermoresponsive triblock copolymer
solutions
(black broken line: ABA(acetal), black solid line: ABA(aldehyde[7]),
and gray solid line: ABA(aldehyde[16]).

The reactivity of aldehyde toward ABA(aldehyde[16]) was confirmed
by the reaction with 2-aminoethanol. After the addition of 2-aminoethanol,
the 1H NMR signal derived from aldehyde completely disappeared,
confirming the presence of imine (−CH=N–, 1H, 7.7 ppm) (Figure S6). Thus, the aldehyde-modified polymer was able to form the
Schiff base by the reaction with primary amine.

Subsequently,
DLS measurements were carried out to estimate the
structural changes of the polymer across the Tp (Figure 4).
Thus, ABA(aldehyde) exhibited a unimodal peak with a volume averaged
diameter at 12.2 ± 4.2 nm at 37 °C, while the peak became
bimodal with volume-averaged diameters of 43.1 ± 6.2 and 552
± 114 nm above the LCST (39 °C). Upon decreasing the temperature
once again to 37 °C, the aggregate peak disappeared, and a signal
was observed at 12.8 ± 9.7 nm. This result indicated that the
polymer was dispersed in water below the LCST and formed an assembly
above the LCST. This assembly possessed a hydrophobic core consisting
of dehydrated thermoresponsive segments, and a hydrophilic PEG outer
shell, which were observed overall as small particles by DLS analysis.
However, from the 1H NMR analysis, a part of the thermoresponsive
segment of the hydrophobic core was exposed because the signal from
the thermoresponsive segment was observed above the LCST (Figure S7). As a result, because of the increased
intermicellar hydrophobic interactions, the nanoparticles formed submicron-sized
nanoparticle aggregates, which were easily destroyed by lowering the
temperature below the LCST (Figure 4C).

Figure 4 Volume average diameter of the ABA(aldehyde[7]) solution
under
a range of conditions: (A) at 37 °C, (B) at 39 °C, and (C)
upon recooling to 37 °C from 39 °C. (D–H) As above
but in the presence of albumin: polymer and albumin were mixed (D)
at 25 °C and (E–H) at 50 °C. Measurement was performed
(D) at 37 °C, (E) at 39 °C, (F,H) upon cooling to 37 °C
from 39 °C (F) at pH 7.4 and (H) at pH 6, and (G) upon heating
to 39 °C from 37 °C at pH 7.4.

To investigate the effect of temperature on the reactivity of the
aldehyde group, ABA(aldehyde[7]) was mixed with the amino-containing
albumin (volume average diameter: 7.0 nm at 37 or 39 °C, Figure S8A,B). First, ABA(aldehyde[7]) and albumin
were mixed at 25 °C. This mixture was almost similar to ABA(aldehyde[7])
except for the formation of aggregates with 143 nm diameter, and no
peak change was observed below 43 °C (Table S1). After phase transition, the mixture formed submicron aggregation
and the aggregate was dissociated on cooling at 37 °C (Figure S8E–F). In contrast, after mixing
at 50 °C, signals corresponding to the ABA(aldehyde[7]) and albumin
mixture were independently observed at 39 °C (Figure 4E). Upon lowering the temperature
of this solution to 37 °C, the aggregate and albumin peaks were
again observed separately. When this solution was returned to 39 °C
again, albumin peak was disappeared and the large aggregation was
confirmed. In contrast, upon lowering the pH of the mixed solution,
the peak corresponding to the nanoparticle aggregates gradually disappeared
(Figure 4H).

These results indicated that the reactivity of the aldehyde unit
in ABA(aldehyde[7]) toward albumin was suppressed when ABA(aldehyde[7])
formed an assembled structure above the LCST. In contrast, below the
LCST, this structure was disassembled and the aldehyde groups became
accessible; therefore, they may react rapidly with the primary amine
groups of albumin to form a Schiff base similar to 2-ethanol amine.
Upon conjugation with the albumin, the structure of the ABA(aldehyde[7])
assembly became fixed. However, this Schiff base gradually dissociates
at low pH values, resulting in collapse of the polymer assembly (Figure 4H). The result indicates
that Schiff base formation can be controlled by the temperature-controlled
structural changes of ABA(aldehyde).

2.4 Formation
and Characterization of the Hydrogel
Solutions of the ABA
triblock copolymer (2.0 wt %, 200 μL)
and poly(allyl amine) (PAA) (4 wt %, 50 μL) were mixed at 50
°C and the changes in viscoelasticity of the solution at 50 and
25 °C were observed (Figure 5). Although the ABA(acetal)/PAA solution showed no
change in viscosity, a mixture of the ABA(aldehyde) and PAA solutions
formed a cloudy sol at 50 °C, and the solution viscosity increased
upon lowering the temperature. Upon increasing the temperature once
again, although the gel became slightly opaque, the solution maintained
its gel state, and the strength of the gel in the second cooling cycle
was greater than that of the first cooling cycle (Figure 5F). Indeed, the gel structure
was maintained beyond one day.

Figure 5 Photographic images of the (A,B) ABA(acetal)
and (C–F) ABA(aldehyde[7])
solutions. The ABA triblock copolymers and PAA were mixed at 50 °C.
(A,C) At 50 °C, (B,D) upon cooling to 25 °C from 50 °C,
(E) upon reheating to 50 °C from 25 °C, and (F) upon recooling
to 25 °C from 50 °C.

Subsequently, the variation in viscoelasticity of the ABA(acetal)
and PAA solutions was observed using a rheometer (Figure 6). Because this solution formed
a precipitate at 50 °C, measurement was performed at 40 and 25
°C. At 40 °C, the storage modulus (G′)
and loss modulus (G″) of the ABA(acetal)/PAA
solution increased gradually with time, and the solution showed a
slightly higher storage modulus compared to the loss modulus. However,
at 25 °C, the G″ value of the solution
became greater than G′. In contrast, the solutions
of ABA(aldehyde)/PAA increased in viscoelasticity upon lowering the
temperature, and the gel viscoelasticity increased with greater numbers
of aldehyde units on the polymer. In addition, the strength of the
hydrogel gradually increased at 30 °C. Overall, we found that
the G′ values of ABA(aldehyde[7]) and ABA(aldehyde[16])
were 42.5 and 130 Pa, respectively. The experiment was also performed
using the ABA(aldehyde[16])/PAA solutions at pH 6.0. In this case,
the changes in viscoelasticity were negligible upon altering the temperature,
and the G″ values were higher than the G′ values regardless of temperature.

at pH 6, (C) ABA(aldehyde[7]), and (D) ABA(aldehyde[16]) solutions
at pH 7. Black and gray lines indicate G′
and G″, respectively.

Finally, hydrogel stability was investigated by immersing the hydrogel
in the phosphate buffer solution at different pH (Table 2). After one day, G′ of the hydrogel in pH 4, 6, and 7 became 53, 93, and 96
Pa, respectively. Although pH was important for the formation of the
Schiff base, the hydrogel maintained its stability at pH 6. In contrast, G′ of hydrogel decreased in the pH 3 solution. The
results indicated the Schiff base in the hydrogel was not rapidly
decomposed during the low pH treatment.

6	93	6.5	
3	53	4.3	
It was also found that
ABA(aldehyde) and the primary amine-bearing
polymer formed an irreversible gel upon altering the temperature (Figure 7). Because gel formation
was suppressed by lowering the pH, it was apparent that a cross-linking
point was formed through Schiff base formation between the aldehyde
group on ABA(aldehyde) and the primary amine moiety of PAA, as shown
in the DLS results. ABA(aldehyde) and PAA immediately formed a hydrogel
upon reducing the temperature, and the strength of this gel gradually
increased, thereby indicating that the reaction between the aldehyde
and the amino group proceeded gradually with time as the temperature
decreased. Interestingly, upon increasing the temperature above Tp once again, the gel strength further increased.
Upon increasing the temperature across the LCST, the thermoresponsive
segment became hydrophobic, and as a result, hydrophobic interactions
formed to give a new cross-linking point in the hydrogel. This ultimately
resulted in the formation of a dense gel network and a stiffer hydrogel.

Figure 7 Illustration
of the structural changes undergone in the thermoresponsive
ABA triblock copolymer. The ABA assembly was destroyed upon lowering
the temperature. In the presence of poly(allylamine), reaction between
the exposed aldehyde group on the ABA polymer and the primary amine
moiety on the poly(allylamine) formed a Schiff base, which resulted
in the production of an irreversible hydrogel.

From the abovementioned results, it was apparent that the reactivity
of the aldehyde functional group in the thermoresponsive ABA triblock
copolymer could be controlled by temperature-dependent structural
changes across the LCST.

3 Conclusions
We herein
reported the preparation of thermoresponsive ABA triblock
copolymers bearing aldehyde groups on the thermoresponsive segments
at both termini. The polymer reversibly formed assembled structures
through altering the temperature across the LCST of the thermoresponsive
segment. Owing to this structural change, the reactivity of the aldehyde
moiety on the thermoresponsive segment toward a primary amine group
of albumin and poly(allylamine) was successfully controlled. In response
to the dissociation of this assembly upon lowering the temperature,
the aldehyde group reacted rapidly with the primary amine to form
a Schiff base. This Schiff base was stable in the experimental temperature
range employed herein, thereby resulting in the formation of a stable
irreversible hydrogel from a mixture of ABA(aldehyde) and the amine-based
polymer. Using this mechanism, the thermoresponsive ABA block copolymer
could be employed as a molecular reactor for medical applications,
such as an injectable hydrogel that controls the sol–gel transition
through the application of an external heat signal.

PAA (Mn: 150 kDa, 40 wt % solution) was
kindly provided by Nittobo Medical (Tokyo, Japan).

4.2 Instrumentation
1H NMR
(400 MHz) spectroscopy was carried out using an NMR ECS-400 instrument
(JOEL, Tokyo, Japan). GPC was performed using a GPC LC-2000Plus series
system (JASCO, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with two Shodex columns (KD-804
and KD-802, Showa Denko, Tokyo, Japan). The eluent was composed of N,N-dimethylformamide containing 3 mmol/L
lithium bromide and 0.5% triethylamine, and a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min
was employed. The hydrodynamic diameters were measured by DLS using
an ELSZ-2PL instrument (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan). The optical
transmittance of each polymer solution (10 mg/mL) at a range of temperatures
(heating rate = 0.5 °C/min) was measured by UV/vis spectrophotometry
(UV–2500PC) (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) (λ: 550 nm). The
phase transition temperature (Tp) was
defined as the temperature at which the light transmittance of a solution
reached 50%. The viscoelasticity was recorded using an AR-G2 rheometer
(TA instruments, New Castle, DE, USA).

4.3 Synthesis
of the DDMAT-Conjugated PEG
The DDMAT-conjugated PEG was
prepared using Lodge’s method
with slight modifications.15 More specifically,
DDMAT (3.65 g, 10.0 mmol) was dried under reduced pressure for 24
h to remove any moisture. Subsequently, dichloromethane (super dehydrated)
(20 mL) and oxalyl chloride (8.6 mL, 12.7 mmol) were added and the
mixture was allowed to react at 25 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere.
After this time, dichloromethane and the hydrogen chloride byproducts
were removed by drying under reduced pressure. Subsequently, PEG (1.0
g, 0.5 mmol) was dried under reduced pressure for 24 h to remove any
moisture from the polymer. After this time, PEG and the activated
DDMAT were dissolved in dehydrated dichloromethane (80 mL) and stirred
at 25 °C for 24 h under an Ar atmosphere. After the reaction,
the solution was filtered and dichloromethane was removed under reduced
pressure. The obtained solid was dissolved in toluene and purified
by repeated precipitation with dropwise addition to hexane. Finally,
the obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure.

4.4 Synthesis of P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)
DDMAT–PEG–DDMAT (0.186 mmol), NIPAAm (134 mmol),
NAS (14.9 mmol), and V-65 (3.72 μmol) were dissolved in 1,4-dioxane
(100 mL), and the resulting solution was allowed to react at 60 °C
for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere. After this time, the produced polymers
were recovered by repeated precipitation in an excess of diethyl ether.
Subsequently, the obtained polymer and AIBN (60 times excess against
DDMAT) were dissolved in ethanol and stirred at 80 °C for 24
h under an Ar atmosphere. Purification of the polymer was by repeated
precipitation in diethyl ether.

4.5 Introduction
of the Aldehyde Group into the
Thermoresponsive Segments
P(NIPAAm-co-NAS)-b-PEG-b-P(NIPAAm-co-NAS),
DEEA (10 times molar equivalent of NAS), and triethylamine (10 times
molar equivalent of NAS) were dissolved in dichloromethane (100 mL)
and the solution was stirred at 25 °C for 24 h. After this time,
the solvent was removed by evaporation and replaced by acetone. The
resulting solution was dialyzed against 0.5 mol/L sodium acetate buffer
(pH 5) for 3 d, and then dialyzed continuously for 1 d against pure
water. Thereafter, hydrochloric acid was added dropwise to the dialysis
solution to adjust the pH to 2. After 5 or 24 h dialysis, the solution
was dialyzed against pure water for 1 d. The obtained polymer solution
was maintained at 4 °C in the absence of light prior to further
use.

4.6 DLS Measurement
The triblock copolymer
was dissolved in Dulbecco’s modified phosphate buffer saline
(1 mg/mL). Before adding the albumin, 1 mL of polymer solution was
maintained at 25 or 50 °C, followed by addition of 100 μL
of albumin solution (1 mg/mL). For the temperature ramp experiment,
the sample cuvette was held in the machine until the polymer solution
achieved the target temperature. To lower the pH of the solution,
hydrochloric acid was added to the polymer and albumin mixture until
the pH became 6.

4.7 Hydrogel Formation
The pH of PAA
(4 wt %) solutions was adjusted to 7.0 using sodium hydroxide. The
triblock copolymer (2 wt %) and PAA (4 wt %) solutions were warmed
in a hot incubator at 50 °C, and then equivalent volumes of the
two solutions were mixed on a hot plate at 50 °C. The resulting
mixture (200 μL) was applied on the prewarming stage of the
rheometer at 50 °C. After holding the sample on the rheometer
plate, measurement was performed for 10–30 min at 40 or 50
°C (above Tp). Next, the temperature
was lowered to 25 °C using the AR-G2 rheometer software. For
measuring pH stability, the hydrogel was immersed in pH 7.0 phosphate
buffer for one day. In addition, the hydrogel was immersed in phosphate
buffer solutions of different pH. After removing the solution, the
hydrogel was applied on the rheometer plate and the time sweep measurement
was performed at 25 °C. All the measurements were performed at
a frequency of 1 Hz and a strain of 1%.
