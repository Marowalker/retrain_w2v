The
potentially tridentate ligand bis[(1-methyl-2-benzimidazolyl)ethyl]amine
(2BB) was employed to prepare copper complexes [(2BB)CuI]OTf and [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 as bioinspired models
of lytic polysaccharide copper-dependent monooxygenase (LPMO) enzymes.
Solid-state characterization of [(2BB)CuI]OTf
revealed a Cu(I) center with a T-shaped coordination environment and
metric parameters in the range of those observed in reduced LPMOs.
Solution characterization of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 indicates that [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2]2+ is the
main species from pH 4 to 7.5; above pH 7.5, the hydroxo-bridged species
[{(2BB)CuII(H2O)x}2(μ-OH)2]2+ is also
present, on the basis of cyclic voltammetry and mass spectrometry.
These observations imply that deprotonation of the central amine of
Cu(II)-coordinated 2BB is precluded, and by extension,
amine deprotonation in the histidine brace of LPMOs appears unlikely
at neutral pH. The complexes [(2BB)CuI]OTf
and [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 act as precursors for the oxidative degradation
of cellobiose as a cellulose model substrate. Spectroscopic and reactivity
studies indicate that a dicopper(II) side-on peroxide complex generated
from [(2BB)CuI]OTf/O2 or [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2/H2O2/NEt3 oxidizes cellobiose
both in acetonitrile and aqueous phosphate buffer solutions, as evidenced
from product analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry. The mixture of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2/H2O2/NEt3 results in more extensive cellobiose degradation.
Likewise, the use of both [(2BB)CuI]OTf and
[(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with KO2 afforded cellobiose oxidation products.
In all cases, a common Cu(II) complex formulated as [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+ was detected by
mass spectrometry as the final form of the complex.

Introduction
The recently reported
lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs),1 also known as the auxiliary activity (AA) family
of copper-dependent enzymes,2 feature a
conserved type 2 copper binding site with a N3 donor set
defined by two imidazoles and a backbone nitrogen from one of the
histidine residues, in a structural motif described as the “histidine
brace” (Chart 1).2a,3 These enzymes oxidatively cleave the polymeric
chains of recalcitrant polysaccharides to assist hydrolytic enzymes
and have potential applications in biomass conversion to renewable
biofuels. Recent studies have established some of the aspects that
govern substrate binding, such as H-bonding to the primary amine of
the histidine brace,4 as well as the potential
involvement of dioxygen5 or hydrogen peroxide6 as oxidants. However, details of the mechanism,
potential intermediates in the key C–H activation step, and
subsequent polysaccharide hydroxylation remain to be determined. Although
cupric–superoxo and oxyl complexes have been suggested as the
reactive intermediates, a mechanistic insight may be obtained from
synthetic models. In this regard, few biomimetic LPMO-inspired copper
complexes have been reported to date,7 despite
the numerous reports on biologically inspired copper–oxygen
systems.8

Diagram of the Dication [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2]2+15
Due to the ubiquitous presence
of coordinated histidine residues
in metalloenzyme active sites, most bioinspired complexes employ amines
and nitrogen-containing heterocycles as histidine models. This approach
has relied heavily on amine-, pyrazole-, and pyridine-based ligands.
In contrast, reports on ligands that incorporate the more electronically
relevant imidazolyl and/or benzimidazolyl donor substituents remain
relatively scarce,9 with the notable exception
of the binucleating scaffolds developed by the groups of Casella.10 We have recently exploited 2-substituted benzimidazoles
to assemble chelating ligands for mononuclear CuII/I complexes;
these ligands offer versatility as good σ-donors and reasonable
π-acceptors toward copper ions, as well as varying degrees of
steric protection.11 Exploration of their
reactivity has revealed the formation of free superoxide anions, presumably
released by solvent displacement from the putative CuII-superoxide species obtained from the corresponding cuprous complexes
and O2.11d These steps have
been suggested to occur in LPMOs on the basis of DFT calculations5 and recently reported structural data,6,12 in a rapid inner-sphere reductive activation of O2.5

In this context, we recently reported the
use of bis[(1-methyl-2-benzimidazolyl)ethyl]amine
(2BB,13,10bChart 1) as a simple structural model of the ligand
environment in mononuclear active sites of LPMO.14,15 Our interest was spurred by the presence of a methylated nitrogen
atom in one of the histidinic imidazoles of fungal LPMO2a and the presence of a central secondary amine
available for potential H-bonding with substrates. Additionally, the 2BB/CuII system afforded complexes with bonding
parameters in the range of those of LPMO active sites (Cu–N
distances of ∼1.98 Å, N–Cu–N angles of ∼97
and ∼165°). In continuation of these preliminary studies,
we herein report detailed spectroscopic studies of [(2BB)CuII/I]2+/+ complexes, their interaction with
O2, H2O2, and KO2, as
well as their oxidative reactivity toward cellobiose as a cellulose
model substrate.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Cu+ Complex
Previous attempts
to isolate cuprous 2BB complexes required for O2 binding and subsequent reactivity studies were hampered by the low
solubility of the tetrafluoroborate or hexafluorophosphate complexes
in dichloromethane.13,14 However, the use of trifluoromethanesulfonate
anions (triflate, OTf) resulted in species soluble in acetonitrile
amenable for solution characterization and reactivity studies. Electrospray
ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed the presence of a peak
at m/z 396 assigned to the monomeric
[(2BB)CuI]+ [Figure S1 in the Supporting Information]. Further characterization
by 1H NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
confirmed the identity of [(2BB)CuI]OTf; its 1H NMR spectrum in CD3CN shows relatively broad
aromatic signals for the benzimidazole groups at δ 7.64, 7.24,
and 7.06 ppm, the resonance for the N-methyl groups
was observed at δ 3.42, whereas the methylene protons gave rise
to resonances at δ 3.21 (−CH2–N) and
3.01 ppm (−CH2–C). FTIR spectroscopy displayed
notable bands at 3273 (w) cm–1 assigned to the central
amine N–H stretch, 1027 and 1257 (s) assigned to S–O
stretching bands of the triflate anion, as well as a pair of strong
bands at 1147 and 1227 cm–1 assigned to C–F
stretching vibrations; a band at 1614 cm–1 was assigned
to the benzimidazole-based C=N stretching mode. The main differences
with the previously reported cupric complex [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 include the
frequencies of the N–H stretch at 3241 (w) cm–1, the slightly higher intensity of the C=N stretching mode
previously observed at 1617 cm–1, and the shoulder
at 3356 cm–1 that was assigned to O–H stretching
modes in the cupric complex.

Solid-State Structure of [(2BB)CuI]OTf
[(2BB)CuI]OTf
was dissolved in a minimum
amount of anhydrous CH3CN, and after slow evaporation,
colorless X-ray quality crystals of [(2BB)CuI]OTf were obtained. The metric parameters around the Cu(I) center
in the [(2BB)CuI]+ cation are in
the range of those reported for the enzymes, displaying the characteristic
T-shape of the reduced form of the active sites of LPMOs, as shown
in Figure 1 and Tables S1–S3. The N1–Cu1–N4
open angle of 165° in [(2BB)CuI]+ is identical to the corresponding one in the AA9–AA11
active sites,16 whereas the two closed
angles, N3–Cu1–N4 and N1–Cu1–N3 of 98.01
and 96.82°, respectively, for [(2BB)CuI]+, are equivalent to that of 97° in LPMO. A comparison
of the bond distances is presented in Table 1, showing a larger Cu–N distance to
the central nitrogen donor than that to the benzimidazole N atoms.
Interestingly, the triflate anion interacts with [(2BB)CuI]+ via hydrogen bonding with the central
amine N–H, defined by an O2···N3 distance of
3.363(3) Å and an O2···H3–N3 angle of 149(2)°.

Solution
Studies of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2
Insight into the
nature of the cupric complex in an aqueous solution was gained through
equilibrium studies to determine its speciation. Potentiometric titration
of 2BB afforded pKa values
of 3.68, 4.86, and 7.84 for the protonated forms of the two benzimidazolic
and amine sites, respectively. The values for the benzimidazolic sites
are lower (in water at 25 °C) than those of benzimidazole at
5.58,17a 1-methylbenzimidazole, 1-ethylbenzimidazole
at 4.88, and even 1-methyl-5-chlorobenzimidazole at 3.88.17b Subsequently, the stability constant for [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2]2+ was determined at log K = 12.44 after refinement
of the potentiometric data with Hyperquad software,18 considering temperature, volumes, and concentrations of
analytes (HNO3, NaOH, potassium biphthalate, 2BB, and its cupric complex, see Figure S2). This log K value is high compared to that
of Cu(II) with bidentate 2-hydroxymethylbenzimidazole and 1-methyl-2-hydroxymethylbenzimidazole
at 9.30 and 9.66, respectively.17a

The species distribution was determined with MEDUSA software19 (ionic strength 0.1 M NaNO3), where
the dicationic species [(2BB)CuII]2+ clearly predominates in the pH range of 4–8; see Figure 2. One or two molecules
of water are likely coordinated to the cupric ion in solution to form
[(2BB)CuII(H2O)n]2+ (n = 1, 2), as observed
in the solid state.15 Interestingly, a
monodeprotonated species is predicted to be present around pH 7.5
and above, which was assigned to a cupric–hydroxo complex [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)n−1]+, likely in the form of a bridged dimer
[{(2BB)CuII(H2O)n−1}2(μ-OH)2]2+, with log K = 15.88. This type of species
would be favored over a complex with a deprotonated central amine,
on the basis of the additional experimental evidence for a hydroxo-bridged
dicopper complex (vide infra). Further support for deprotonation of
a coordinated water molecule over an amine donor is provided by studies
on the effect of metal coordination on the pKa values of biologically relevant ligands, with transition-metal
ions increasing the acidity by 1–3 log units.20 These observations suggest that the potential involvement
of a deprotonated amine during the catalytic cycle may be ruled out
in our system and plausibly in the active site of LPMO as well. In
the enzymatic system, the proposed deprotonation of the terminal amine
of the histidine brace12 seems unlikely
near neutral pH,4−6 particularly considering determinations of the pKa values of terminal amino groups in related
ATCUN peptide complexes.21 Quantum refinement
of X-ray and neutron diffraction data also argues against −NH2 deprotonation.22

[(2BB)CuII]2+.

Electrochemical Studies
The species distribution is
supported by electrochemical results obtained at pH 5.0, 7.0, 9.0,
and 10.5 of aqueous solutions of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2. The system behaves
quasireversibly, with one redox wave assigned to the CuII/I couple at E1/2 = 226 mV vs standard
hydrogen electrode (SHE) at pH 5.0–7.0, which is in the range
of the redox potentials reported for LPMOs (150–370 mV vs SHE).
Differences were observed at pH 9.0–10.5; in the former case,
a shoulder at a slightly more negative potential indicates the presence
of an additional species. This is confirmed at pH 10.5, where the
shoulder becomes the only wave observed (Figure 3). In CH3CN, electrochemical analysis
of [(2BB)CuI]OTf shows a quasireversible behavior,
with E1/2 = 76 mV vs SHE (−272
mV vs ferrocenium/ferrocene, Figure S3).

voltammograms of 1 mM [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 solutions in phosphate
buffer (PB) at pH 5.0, 7.0, and 9.0, and in carbonate buffer at pH
10.5, acquired at 1 V s–1 with a glassy carbon electrode
(at pH 10.5, the system is heterogeneous).

Insight into the identity of the additional species formed
at pH
9.0–10.5 was obtained through ESI-MS analysis of a solution
of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2. A signal was detected at m/z 887, which was assigned to the mixed hydroxo/carbonato-bridged dicopper
complex shown in Scheme 1 on the basis of its mass and isotope distribution. The complex detected
may be formed upon aerobic CO2 insertion into an initially
formed dihydroxo-bridged dimeric complex [{(2BB)CuII(H2O)x}2(μ-OH)2]2+.23 UV–vis spectroscopic evidence of the formation of the putative
[{(2BB)CuII(H2O)x}2(μ-OH)2]2+ was
obtained by addition of NEt3 to an acetonitrile solution
of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 at room temperature. A new band was observed at 330 nm (ε
∼ 2000 M–1 cm–1), which
can be assigned as a hydroxo to Cu(II) ligand-to-metal charge-transfer
(LMCT) transition; see Figure S4.

Water at pH 9.0 with Experimental (Left) and Simulated
Isotopic Mass Spectrometry Patterns (Right)
These observations confirm that deprotonation of a coordinated
water molecule is more facile than that of the amine in our system.
This deprotonation occurs at a higher pH value (7.5) than that used
in the study suggesting terminal amine deprotonation (i.e., pH 7.0),12 further emphasizing that the amine is likely
to remain protonated at enzymatic pH. Moreover, the optimum pH value
for enzymatic activity is slightly acidic,4,5 rendering
the deprotonation of the terminal amine even less likely.

Reactivity
of [(2BB)CuI]OTf with O2
The reactivity of [(2BB)CuI]OTf with dioxygen
was explored initially by UV–vis spectroscopy
at low temperature in an acetonitrile solution. Gentle bubbling of
O2 through 0.3 mM solutions of [(2BB)CuI]OTf at 243 K resulted in the appearance of a broad band at
360 nm, assigned to ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) of a copper–oxygen
species, accompanied by d–d transition at 680 nm; a similar
behavior was observed in acetone at 193 K. The species was stable
for at least an hour, although decay was observed when the temperature
was raised; see Figure S5. These changes
were not observed under similar conditions or at lower temperature
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) solutions, and reactivity studies in this
solvent were not pursued. In aqueous phosphate buffer (PB) at 273
K, no significant changes were observed by UV–vis spectroscopy
upon bubbling O2 through in situ-reduced (with 1.2–1.5
equiv of sodium ascorbate) [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2. In both acetonitrile and
PB solutions, the products generated at low temperature were characterized
by ESI-MS, revealing the presence of an intense signal at m/z 396 assigned to [(2BB)CuI]+; see Figure S1.

The mixture was characterized by electron paramagnetic resonance
(EPR) spectroscopy, revealing that although [(2BB)CuI]OTf reacts slowly with dioxygen in acetonitrile at 243 K,
a signal characteristic of a cupric complex in an axial coordination
environment appears after ca. 10 min [g∥ = 2.250, g⊥ = 2.082, A∥ = 423 MHz (151 G), integration 21% relative to Cu(II) external standard].
A reasonable explanation would imply initial formation of an EPR silent
cupric–superoxo complex [(2BB)CuII(O2)]+, likely in equilibrium with a side-on peroxo-bridged
dicopper(II) complex [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ (on the basis of UV–vis spectroscopy and H2O2 reactivity section below). H-abstraction from solvent
or cellobiose may result in the EPR-active cupric hydroperoxo [(2BB)CuII(OOH)(S)]+ and/or the further
downstream hydroxo complex [(2BB)CuII(OH)(S)]+ (S = H2O, CH3CN). These species may
give rise to the shoulder at 330 nm by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
(Figure S5). Cu(I) oxygenation leading
to a Cu(II)-hydroperoxo complex through H-abstraction has been previously
observed.24 Finally, both Cu(II)-hydroperoxo
and dicopper(II)-peroxo may further react to generate the final product
[(2BB)CuII(OH)(S)]+, in equilibrium
with the dimeric form [{(2BB)CuII(S)x}2(μ-OH)2]2+ (Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Proposed
Reaction Manifolds and Putative Copper Complexes Generated
from [(2BB)CuI]+/O2 (Top
Left) or [(2BB)CuII(S)2]2+/H2O2/NEt3 (Top Right)
In PB/glycerol at pH 7.0 and
273 K, [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 reduced in situ with
1.2 equiv of sodium ascorbate produced no changes after bubbling of
O2, changes were not observed. However, addition of cellobiose
to the oxygenated PB solution resulted in an axial signal with g∥ = 2.275 and g⊥ = 2.054 and A∥ =
502 MHz (179 G) and A⊥ = 70 MHz
(25 G); see Figure 4; the spectrum was simulated as containing one or two Cu(II) species,
with only the former case resulting in a good fit. Examples of mononuclear
copper–hydroperoxo complexes featuring tripodal pyridylamine
and pyridylamine–thioether ligands have been characterized
by EPR spectroscopy and assigned to trigonal bipyramidal [g∥ = 2.004, g⊥ = 2.207, A∥ = MHz 305 (109 G), A⊥ = 210 MHz (75 G)]25 or square pyramidal geometries [g∥ = 2.24, g⊥ = 2.06, A∥ = 471 MHz (168 G); g∥ = 2.25, g⊥ = 2.04, A∥ = 504 MHz (180 G)].26 A similar situation has been observed with monomeric
cupric–hydroxo complexes: EPR spectroscopic data for tripodal
complexes have been observed to give rise to “inverse”
signals, whereas axial signals with some degree of rhombicity have
been observed in the few cases of tetragonal Cu(II)–OH complexes
[gx = 2.032, gy = 2.055, gz = 2.185, ACu = 588 MHz (189 G), AN =
40–53 MHz (14–19 G)].27 Resemblance
of the parameters to those of the tetragonal species suggests a square
pyramidal coordination environment for the putative Cu(II)–hydroperoxo7c,26 or hydroxo complexes, likely with weak donors in the axial positions
[(2BB)CuII(OOH)(S)]+ or [(2BB)CuII(OH)(S)]+ (S = solvent, see Scheme 2).

Figure 4 EPR spectra of in situ-generated
[(2BB)CuI]+ with 1.5 equiv of sodium
ascorbate after bubbling O2 and adding 10 equiv of cellobiose
(3 mM in PB, blue trace),
and mixture of [(2BB)CuI]OTf, 1.2 equiv of
KO2, and 10 equiv of cellobiose (3 mM in CH3CN, red trace).

Reactivity of [(2BB)CuI]OTf and [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with KO2
The reactivity of the copper
complexes with a one-electron reduced form of dioxygen was explored
with KO2; this may be important to establish the oxidant
in LPMOs, since H2O2 has been suggested instead
of the originally proposed O2.6 Thus, addition of KO2 to solutions of [(2BB)CuI]OTf was monitored by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
to identify potential copper–oxygen species, both in acetonitrile
and PB solution at pH 7.0. In acetonitrile, the main spectral change
consisted of a shoulder at 365 nm, which intensified slightly after
addition of cellobiose. Analysis of the reaction mixture by ESI-MS
revealed the presence of a peak at m/z 431 assigned to [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+, along with peaks at m/z 396 and 545 characteristic of [(2BB)CuI]+ and [(2BB)CuII(OTf)]+ (Figure S6). When cellobiose was added, ESI-MS
evidenced the presence of oxidative degradation products (vide infra).
An analogous behavior was observed in PB by UV–vis, although
the shoulder was observed at 345 nm. Three relevant peaks were detected
by ESI-MS: the one at m/z 412 is
consistent with a monooxygenation product [(2BB)CuII(O)]+, which could correspond to ligand hydroxylation,
although such a product was not detected after demetallation with
excess aqueous ammonia; a cupryl species cannot be firmly supported
without further evidence. A peak at m/z 428 was assigned to the putative cupric–superoxo [(2BB)CuII(O2)]+ and the one
at m/z 602 was tentatively assigned
to [(2BB)CuII(O)(OTf)(CH3CN)]+ (Figure S7); the aforementioned
species at m/z 396 and 545 were
also detected. These observations imply that highly reactive copper–oxygen
species are formed in the Cu(I)/KO2 system, allowing detection
of the relatively stable downstream product [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+.

EPR spectra recorded
from flash frozen samples over the course of the reaction reveal that
after addition of KO2 to [(2BB)CuI]OTf in acetonitrile, a signal characteristic of a cupric complex
in an axial environment appears, with g∥ = 2.250 and g⊥ = 2.050 and A∥ = 536 MHz (191 G) and A⊥ = 81 MHz (29 G), Figure 4. The signal becomes more intense upon addition
of cellobiose, possibly due to generation of the proposed [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+ after
H-abstraction,27 which was detected by
ESI-MS. The analogous reaction of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 in either CH3CN or PB solutions with KO2 did not show considerable
changes in its UV–vis absorption spectra, even after addition
of cellobiose. No evidence for copper–oxygen species was obtained
by ESI-MS or EPR spectroscopy in the reactions of the Cu(II) complex
with KO2. Thus, a cupric–superoxo complex cannot
be detected under these conditions.

Reactivity of [(2BB)Cu]OTf and [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with
H2O2
The reaction of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with
H2O2 was monitored by UV–vis spectroscopy
to determine whether different species are formed relative to the
reaction of the Cu(I) complex with O2, both in acetonitrile
and PB (pH 7.0). In acetonitrile, no changes with respect to the original
spectrum were observed, even after addition of cellobiose; an analogous
behavior was observed in PB. High-performance liquid chromatography-mass
spectrometry (HPLC-MS) analysis indicated that cellobiose did not
undergo degradation. In contrast, reaction of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with 1:1 mixtures
of H2O2/Et3N in acetonitrile resulted
in spectral changes characterized mainly by an absorbance maximum
around 365 nm (see Figures S8 and S9) and
a d–d transition at 670 nm. Another copper complex appears
to be present, on the basis of the shoulder observed at ca. 330 nm.
A mixture of the proposed dimeric [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ and monomeric [(2BB)CuII(OOH)(S)]+ and/or [(2BB)CuII(OH)(S)]+ complexes (cf. Scheme 2) may be responsible for the optical features described, with
ample precedent for μ-η2:η2-peroxo dicopper(II) complexes with intense absorption bands around
360 nm.10,28 The few examples reported of monomeric,
tetragonal cupric hydroperoxo, and hydroxo complexes feature LMCT
bands that are blue-shifted relative to the dimeric peroxo-bridged
species,25−27 which is consistent with our observations. The similarity
with the UV–vis absorption spectrum of the reaction mixture
with [(2BB)CuI]+ and dioxygen (see Figure S10) further suggests the formation of
peroxo dicopper(II) species in the reaction of Cu(I) with O2 described above. [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ may form by rapid capture of an initially formed cupric–superoxo
[(2BB)CuII(O2)]+ by
a second equivalent of [(2BB)CuI]+. The reaction of [(2BB)CuI]OTf with H2O2 was also analyzed by UV–vis absorption
and EPR techniques, resulting in spectra with poorly defined features.

The presence of dicopper species in acetonitrile solution was confirmed
by cryospray ionization mass spectrometry (CSI-MS) under conditions
that are similar to those employed for UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.
As soon as 3 equiv of H2O2/Et3N were
added to [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 in acetonitrile, the sample was injected at 243
K, identifying [(2BB)2Cu2II(μ-CO3)(OTf)]+, [(2BB)2Cu2II(μ-O2)]2+, and [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+. Spectral comparison with the injected sample acquired at
293 K (once the band at 365 nm decayed) shows that similar species
are formed, but the bimetallic species are favored at higher temperature,
on the basis of their intensities (Table S4 and Figure S11).

Analysis of the reaction mixture by EPR
spectroscopy reveals that
after reaction of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with 1:1 H2O2/Et3N in acetonitrile, the signal characteristic of a
cupric complex in an axial coordination environment becomes weak after
ca. 10 min, likely due to formation of the antiferromagnetically coupled
[{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+; this species
is stable for at least 2 h at 243 K, on the basis of UV–vis
and EPR measurements.

Addition of the potentially chelating
acetate anion (OAc–, 3 equiv in methanol/acetonitrile)
to 0.3 mM [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 in acetonitrile
was tested to interrogate the nature of the dimeric species formed
upon addition of 30 equiv of H2O2/Et3N.29,30 The reaction was monitored by UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy at 243 K, showing the generation of the band
at 365 nm, attributed to [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+, along with new bands at 414 and 440 nm; see Figure 5.

CH3CN, 3 equiv of NaOAc in 60 μL of CH3CN/MeOH, black trace) after addition of 3 equiv of 1:1 H2O2/Et3N (green), and 30 equiv of the same (brown);
follow-up of the reaction and the final spectrum after 100 min (purple
trace).

The band at 365 nm decays over
a period of 75 min at 243 K, with
concomitant increase in the intensity of the bands at 414 and 440
nm; this transformation occurs almost instantaneously by increasing
the temperature to 293 K. Similar results were observed upon addition
of O2, KO2, or H2O2 to
cuprous and cupric complexes in the presence of OAc–. CSI-MS analysis of the final products at 243 K revealed the presence
of [(2BB)2Cu2II(μ-η2-OAc)2(OTf)]+ and [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ (Table S5), with their intensities increasing upon warming up the mixture
to 293 K; see Figure S12. EPR spectroscopy
reveals that once H2O2/Et3N is added,
the signal characteristic of the cupric complex in an axial coordination
environment becomes weak after ca. 10 min due to formation of the
antiferromagnetically coupled [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ (Figure S13).

Resonance Raman
Spectroscopy
Further characterization
of the proposed dimer [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ and the associated complex formed upon addition of NaOAc
was attempted by resonance Raman spectroscopy. Since these species
give rise to the bands observed by UV–vis absorption spectroscopy
at 365 nm and 414 and 440 nm, respectively, measurements were carried
out with mixtures of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 and 1:1 H2O2/Et3N, with and without added sodium acetate, and excitation
at 355 and 457 nm. Raman spectra recorded with excitation at 355 nm
was employed at 243 K to favor detection of [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+, whereas excitation at 457 nm was employed
at 293 K to favor detection of the unidentified species that gives
absorption maxima at 414 and 440 nm (Figures S14 and S15). Although strong signals are present, no isotope-sensitive
bands are clearly discernible (H216O2 vs H218O2), as the spectra appear
to be dominated by ligand-based vibrations. In the case of [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+, the main absorption
band in the UV–vis spectrum is associated to a 2BB-based transition (see the theoretical section and Figures S21 and S22).

Preparative Scale Oxidations
of Cellobiose with [(2BB)Cu]OTf and [(2BB)Cu(H2O)2](OTf)2
Oxidations
of cellobiose using 0.3 mM acetonitrile
solutions of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2, 10 equiv of H2O2/Et3N, and 10 equiv of cellobiose at 243 K were undertaken
(cf. Figure S16 and Table S6). Similarly,
a comparative reaction was performed by generating the Cu(I) complex
in situ from the reduction of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 with 10 equiv of sodium ascorbate
and subsequent bubbling of O2, followed by addition of
10 equiv of cellobiose (Figure S17 and Table S7). As a common product of these reactions, sodium gluconate was detected
by HPLC-MS (Scheme 3 and Table 2), demonstrating
that the [(2BB)CuII/I]2+/+ system
has biomimetic activity for oxidative cellobiose degradation in the
presence of the appropriate oxidizing agent. It should be noted that
the reaction that employed in situ-generated [(2BB)CuI]+ in PB with O2 as oxidant is slightly
more selective toward gluconate formation, since it was detected in
higher yield by HPLC-MS. In PB with H2O2/Et3N as oxidant, the doubly oxidized glucose in Scheme 3 is the main product (Figure S18). The H2O2 reaction
shows a greater degree of cellobiose degradation, but more products
are observed (i.e., H2O2 is a more active but
less selective oxidant, Figures S16–S18, Tables S6–S8). Reactions were also performed using in
situ-reduced cupric complex (with 1.2 and 2.4 equiv ascorbate) and
KO2 as an oxidizing agent, with similar degradation products
detected, along with unreacted cellobiose (Table 2). Control experiments with [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2, CuSO4, H2O2/NEt3, and CuSO4/H2O2/NEt3 show no oxidative
degradation of cellobiose, although a previously observed dehydration
product was detected at m/z 334
in the first case. Care must be exercised in the interpretation of
chromatograms, since all samples containing H2O2 have a leaching product from the HPLC column (Figure S19).

as the major product relative to double oxidation (33 vs 14%). In
addition to unreacted glucose, sodium gluconate and glucose aldehyde
were detected in small quantities (Table 2). The only precedent of related inorganic
systems capable of cleaving glucose derivatives features 4-nitrophenolate
as the leaving group.7b,7c

Computational Studies
The thermodynamic feasibility
of the copper–oxygen species that may be formed in the presence
of the oxidants tested (O2, KO2, and H2O2) was evaluated by density functional studies. Reactions
of [(2BB)CuI]+, [(2BB)CuII]2+, [(2BB)CuI(S)]+, and [(2BB)CuII(S)]2+ (S = H2O, CH3CN) with dioxygen, potassium
superoxide, or hydrogen peroxide were evaluated as they appear to
generate the dimeric [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ and potentially [{(2BB)CuIII}2(μ-O)2]2+. The optimized structures
were validated by comparison of the bonding parameters obtained with
those observed for the structurally characterized complexes.

Initial
Complexes
[(2BB)CuI]+ and
[(2BB)CuII]2+ were considered with
either a molecule of water or CH3CN coordinated, since
those solvents were employed for physical measurements
and reactivity tests. For both solvents, the coordination of one molecule
is energetically favorable, with values between 3 and 30 kcal mol–1 (Table 3). The Gibbs free energies for the solvent-coordinated cuprous complexes
notwithstanding, calculated for [(2BB)CuI(H2O)]+ and [(2BB)CuI(NCCH3)]+ at −3 and −5 kcal mol–1, are rather low compared with the binding constants calculated for
their cupric counterparts. This is consistent with the lack of experimental
evidence for coordinated solvent molecules in the solid state or in
solution by ESI-MS, which can be attributed to the high lability of
the Cu(I) centers. The geometries of [(2BB)CuI]+ and the related solvent-coordinated [(2BB)CuI(H2O)]+ were optimized, and
their main geometrical parameters are shown in Table S11. Initial optimization was probed with [(2BB)CuI]+ and subsequently tested with one H2O ligand, revealing that the nitrogen atoms are maintained
in a planar configuration. In the resulting [(2BB)CuI(H2O)]+, the cuprous center should be
defined as four-coordinate but the calculated distance of the nitrogen
atom from the central amine to the Cu+ ion is considerably
longer than in the absence of a bound H2O (2.407 vs 2.940
Å).

Redox Properties
The redox potentials for [(2BB)CuII/I]2+/+, [(2BB)Cu(CH3CN)II/I]2+/+, and [(2BB)Cu(H2O)II/I]2+/+ couples were estimated
by simulating the oxidation process in an acetonitrile solution and
referenced to the ferrocenium/ferrocene couple.31 The calculated potential for trigonal [(2BB)CuII/I]2+/+ was 219 mV, which differs significantly
from that calculated with one coordinated molecule of acetonitrile
(−135 mV) or water (−305 mV). Since the latter values
with solvent coordinated to the copper centers are reasonably close
to the experimentally determined data in acetonitrile solution (E1/2 = −272 mV), solvent coordination
seems to be plausible. In all cases, redox pairs involve a metal-centered
process, i.e., the CuII/I couple.

Dimeric
Species
During our attempts to detect copper–oxygen
species that may be responsible for the oxidation of cellobiose, the
main candidates are the dicopper(II) species [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+ and derivatives having acetate co-ligands.
Since several geometries for Cu2O2 cores have
been described in the literature,10,28−30 different conformations of the ligands were considered in the molecular
optimization of dicopper species (Figure S21). Their relative energies in acetonitrile were calculated (Table S12) and, as expected, the bimetallic complexes
were found to be more stable than the mononuclear T-shape Cu(I) complex
by more than 20 kcal mol–1 in CH3CN.
Nevertheless, the presence of acetate modifies the dioxygen coordination
around the metal centers, predicting the additional species [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η1:η1-O2)(μ-AcO)]+.

UV–vis spectra were calculated for complexes with and without
acetate as co-ligand (Figure S22). Apparently,
coordination of a bridging acetate does not alter the main electronic
transitions in the bimetallic complexes. For [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η2:η2-O2)]2+, an intense band around 330 nm with
a 2BB to dioxygen charge-transfer character was calculated,
together with a weaker one at 420 nm having an MLCT character; the
first band is consistent with the experimentally observed absorption
at 365 nm. For optimized [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η1:η1-O2)(μ-AcO)]+ in Figure S21 (species D), a medium intensity band is predicted at
420 nm, although the one predicted at around 650 nm is not observed
experimentally (Figures S22 and S23); assignment
of [{(2BB)CuII}2(μ-η1:η1-O2)(μ-AcO)]+ is only tentative without experimental verification.

Conclusions
[(2BB)CuI]+ acts as a structural
and electronic model of the reduced site of LPMO enzymes. Speciation
studies at different pH values, together with electrochemical and
mass spectrometry measurements at pH 9.0–10.5, allow us to
establish that the pKa of water molecules
bound to 2BB-coordinated cupric centers is lower than
that of the ligand-based amine moiety; this observation is relevant
to the enzymatic system, where the proposed deprotonation of the amine
of the histidine brace appears to be precluded.

Oxidative cleavage
of cellobiose, which was employed as a model
polysaccharide substrate, could be effected in the presence of [(2BB)CuI]+ or [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2]2+ under appropriate
conditions. Clear identification of a copper–oxygen species
responsible for the C–H activation that leads to the oxidative
cleavage of cellobiose was not possible via low-temperature UV–vis
absorption, MS, Raman, or EPR spectroscopic methods in CH3CN or PB. However, the detection of potential reactive intermediates
by ESI-MS, as well as [(2BB)CuII(OH)(H2O)]+ as the common end product, provides some clues
regarding the mechanistic possibilities outlined in Scheme 2.

Moreover, when a more
reduced source of the oxidizing agent is
provided in our system (i.e., H2O2 vs O2), more degradation of cellobiose was observed by HPLC-MS
on a preparative scale, at a cost of lower selectivity. This is consistent
with the tentative mechanisms that have been proposed for LPMOs, which
imply Cu(I)/H2O2 as the most competent combination32 and H2O2 as the natural
oxidant for polysaccharide degradation.6 Nonetheless, identification of the reactive copper–oxygen
species involved in the key C–H activations remains a major
challenge in copper bioinorganic chemistry.

Experimental Section
All synthetic procedures were performed under a dry dinitrogen
atmosphere in a glovebox or by conventional Schlenk techniques. THF
and diethyl ether were obtained by oxygen- and water-free distilling
from sodium benzophenone under a N2 atmosphere; acetonitrile
was distilled from CaH2. Reagents were purchased from commercial
suppliers and used as received; 2BB(10b,13) and [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)214,15 were synthesized according to
literature procedures. 1H and 13C NMR spectra
were recorded on a JEOL Eclipse 300 or a Bruker Avance DRX spectrometer
at 300 and 75 MHz or 500 and 125 MHz, respectively, using the residual
protiated solvent signal or TMS as internal references (TMS δ
= 0.00, CHCl3 δ = 7.26 ppm). Electrospray ionization
mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) experiments were performed with a JEOL
JMS-AX505HA spectrometer. Positive-ion FAB+ mass spectra
were acquired using a JEOL JMS-SX-102A mass spectrometer operated
at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV from a nitrobenzyl alcohol matrix
by using xenon atoms at 6 keV. Cryospray ionization mass spectra were
recorded on a Bruker MicrOTOF-Q II instrument at Serveis Tècnics
of the University of Girona. Samples were introduced into the mass
spectrometer ion source by direct infusion using a syringe pump and
were externally calibrated using sodium formate. A cryospray attachment
was used. Temperature of the nebulizing and drying gases was set at
−30 °C. The instrument was operated in both positive-
and negative-ion modes.

X-ray Crystallography
A single crystal
of [(2BB)CuI]OTf mounted on a glass fiber
was studied with an
Oxford Diffraction Gemini “A” diffractometer and a CCD
area detector (λMoKα = 0.71073 Å, monochromator:
graphite) source equipped with a sealed tube X-ray source at 130 K.
Unit cell constants were determined with a set of 15/3 narrow frame/run
(1° in ω) scans. A data set consisted of 235 frames of
intensity data collected and a crystal-to-detector distance of 55.00
mm. The double pass method of scanning was used to exclude any noise.
The collected frames were integrated by using an orientation matrix
determined from the narrow frame scans. CrysAlisPro and CrysAlis RED
software packages were used for data collection and data integration.33 Analysis of the integrated data did not reveal
any decay. Final cell constants were determined by a global refinement
of 12 733 reflections (θ < 29.51°). Collected
data were corrected for absorbance by using analytical numeric absorption
correction using a multifaceted crystal model based on expressions
upon the Laue symmetry using equivalent reflections.34 Structure solution and refinement were carried out with
SHELXS-201435a and SHELXL-2014;35b WinGX v2014.1 software36 was used to prepare material for publication. Full-matrix least-squares
refinement was carried out by minimizing (Fo2 – Fc2)2. All nonhydrogen atoms were refined anisotropically. The
H atom of the amine group (H–N) was located in the difference
map and refined isotropically with Uiso(H) = 1.2 for H–N. H atoms attached to C atoms were placed
in geometrically idealized positions and refined as riding on their
parent atoms, with C–H = 0.95–0.99 Å and with Uiso(H) = 1.2Ueq(C)
for aromatic and methylene groups and Uiso(H) = 1.5Ueq(C) for methyl groups. A
summary of crystallographic data is presented in Tables S1–S3, Supporting Information. Crystallographic
data have been deposited at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre
CCDC 1821707.

Computational Details
Unrestricted
calculations were
carried out using the Gaussian 09 package.37 The hybrid density functional method known as B3LYP was applied.38 Effective core potentials were used to represent
the innermost electrons of the transition-metal atoms and the valence
double-ζ quality basis set LANL2DZ associated with the pseudopotentials.39 The basis set used for the main group elements
was 6-31G*.40 Solvent effects were taken
into account through PCM calculations (acetonitrile, ε = 36.64
and water, ε = 78.3553)41 by using
the geometries optimized for the gas phase (single-point calculations).
Gibbs free energies in solution were calculated from a thermodynamic
cycle of the chemical process by adding solvent effects. Redox potentials
were estimated from these solvent calculations by using as reference
a value of 5.08 V for the absolute standard hydrogen electrode (SHE)
in acetonitrile.42 The geometrical parameters
were analyzed using the SHAPE program.43

Vertical excitation energies were obtained from TD-DFT, as
implemented in Gaussian 09 in the presence of solvent (acetonitrile).
Calculations were performed at the same computational level as singlet
states for the dimeric species, using the broken-symmetry approach.
Closed-shell singlet and triplet states were also calculated, with
small differences.

Electrochemistry
Cyclic voltammetry
measurements were
made under N2 in anhydrous CH3CN, carbonate
buffer solution at pH 10.5, or phosphate buffer solutions at pH =
5.0, 7.0, and 9.0, with a CH Instruments potentiostat–galvanostat
equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode and a platinum wire
auxiliary electrode. Potentials were recorded versus a pseudoreference
electrode of AgBr(s)/Ag(wire) immersed in 0.1 M NBu4Br
acetonitrile or distilled water solutions. All voltammograms were
started from the current null potential (Ei = 0) and were scanned in both directions, positive and negative,
and obtained at scan rates of 0.10 and 0.20 V s–1. In agreement with IUPAC convention, the voltammogram of the ferrocenium-ferrocene
(Fc+/Fc) system31 was obtained
to establish the values of half wave potentials (E1/2) from the expression E1/2 = (Ea + Ec)/2. To obtain the normalized current for each complex, the measured
current was divided by the exact molar concentration of the electroactive
species.

Solution Studies
For potentiometric titrations, the
electrode was calibrated in water, using standard buffers at 25 °C.
Commercial 0.1 M NaOH standard solutions were employed, after determination
of carbonates present using the Gran Method, ensuring that their concentration
was below 5%. The solution of HNO3 at 8 mM concentration
was prepared directly from concentrated acid. Potassium biphthalate
was used as an internal standard (oven vacuum-drying 24 h prior to
use).

The analytes 2BB and of [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 were
acidified in a 1:8 ratio with respect to HNO3 to ensure
complete protonation, maintaining in each case a concentration of
1.21 × 10–3 mol L–1. The
solutions were maintained in a special cell at 25 °C, stirred
under a nitrogen atmosphere, controlling the ionic strength at 0.1
M with NaNO3 under homogeneous conditions. Potentiometric
data were obtained in triplicate for acid, base, internal standard,
and analytes using a 702SM Titrino automatic titrator and TIAMO1.3
software; for each triplicate, the standard deviation was determined
and the final values were averaged. Hyperquad18 was employed to simulate the data obtained, so that the constants
adjusted the model with χ2 lower than 12.6 with 95%
confidence and the species distribution was determined with MEDUSA.19

Synthesis of [(2BB)CuI]OTf
In an inert atmosphere glovebox, 2BB (100
mg, 0.30 mmol)
and [CuI(NCCH3)4]OTf (113 mg, 0.30
mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL of anhydrous CH3CN; after
3 h, volatiles were evaporated under reduced pressure and the solid
obtained was washed with 10 mL of anhydrous diethyl ether to afford
colorless microcrystalline [(2BB)CuI]OTf (39

Reactivity Studies
The reactivity
studies that were
carried out with the 2BB-copper complexes were monitored
by UV–vis, ESI-MS, and EPR:

For UV–vis, a 0.3
mM concentration solution of the complex under study was prepared,
2.5 mL was transferred to a 1 cm optical path cell (Schlenk type in
the case of cuprous complex, which was sealed with a rubber septum).
The cell was transferred to a precooled cryostat and chilled to 243
or 273 K, depending on the solvent used (CH3CN, PB pH 7.0),
with 10 min allowed for equilibration prior to reaction. Oxygenation
of the cuprous complex was achieved by gently bubbling dioxygen through
the solution using a long needle for 50 s; addition of KO2, H2O2 35%, or H2O2/Et3N dissolved in CH3CN, H2O, or a MeOH/CH3CN mixture (2:3) was performed with 1 equiv of the oxidizing
agent in 2 μL of solvent. The stability of the formed species
was monitored every 5 min over a period of an hour by measuring the
absorbance. Reversibility of each generated system was also determined
by bubbling Ar through the solution for 50 s using a long needle.
Once the copper–oxygen species was formed, 10 equiv of cellobiose
as a substrate was added while stirring in 20 μL of water or
a 2:3 H2O/CH3CN mixture; the samples were monitored
every 5 min over a period of 40 min by measuring the absorbance. The
same samples were injected in ESI-MS spectrometers under appropriate
conditions.

Characterization by X-band electron spin resonance
(EPR) spectroscopy
was undertaken in frozen acetonitrile or PB pH 7.0/glycerol. Two hundred
microliters of a 3 mM stock solution of the cuprous or cupric complex
in CH3CN or PB/glycerol were placed in quartz EPR tubes
([(2BB)CuI]OTf was prepared in a dinitrogen-filled
glovebox) and were sealed with rubber septa. Samples were frozen in
liquid nitrogen before acquisition at 77 K for CH3CN and
PB/glycerol. The tubes were warmed in ice (273 for PB solution) or
ice/acetone (243 K for CH3CN solution) baths until the
samples became fluid. Oxygenation of cuprous complexes was achieved
by bubbling O2 through the solutions using a long needle
for 50 s. The oxidizing agents used were as follows: KO2 in 1:1 methanol/acetonitrile or H2O; H2O2, or H2O2/Et3N, maintaining
1 equiv of the oxidizing agent in 2 μL of solution. After addition,
spectra were acquired again at 77 or 133 K, respectively. After formation
of copper–oxygen species, 10 equiv of cellobiose dissolved
in 20 μL of water or a 2:3 MeOH/CH3CN mixture was
added and the spectra were acquired again at 77 K. In situ generation
of the Cu(I) complex from [(2BB)CuII(H2O)2](OTf)2 was achieved by adding 1.2
equiv of sodium ascorbate in 20 μL of distilled water or a 2:3
MeOH/CH3CN mixture.

Raman spectra at 355 and 405
nm were recorded at −30 °C
(QNW temperature control cell holder) and room temperature. Raman
spectra recorded at 355 (10 mW Cobalt lasers) and 457 (50 mW Cobalt
lasers) nm used a home-built system in which the laser was focused
on the sample in a 180° backscattering arrangement and Raman
scattering was collected, collimated, and subsequently refocused via
a pair of 2.5 cm diameter planoconvex lens (f = 15
and 10 cm, respectively). The collected light was filtered by an appropriate
long pass edge filter (Semrock) and dispersed by a Shamrock500i spectrograph
(slit width 80 μm, Andor Technology) with a 2400 L/mm grating
blazed at 300 nm and a Shamrock300i spectrograph (slit width 80 μm,
Andor Technology) with a 1200 L/mm grating blazed at 500 nm, respectively.
Data were recorded using Andor Solis (Andor Technology) with spectral
calibration performed using the Raman spectrum of acetonitrile/toluene
50:50 (v/v).44 Samples were held in quartz
1 cm path length cuvettes. Spectra analysis and processing was performed
using the program Spectragryph 1.2.11.45

Preparative Scale Cellobiose and Glucose Degradation
Studies
were carried out with 3 mL of 2BB–Cu
complexes and 10 equiv of oxidizing agent or 1 atmosphere of O2 at 273 K (PB) or 243 K (CH3CN) and 10 equiv of
cellobiose or glucose in 1 mL of distilled water. The mixtures were
stirred for 2 h prior to characterization by HPLC-MS with an Agilent
1200 infinity Q-ToF spectrometer equipped with a Poroshell 120 column.
