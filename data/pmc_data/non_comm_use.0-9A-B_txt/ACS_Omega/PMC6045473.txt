In
this work, we describe a low-cost, two-step synthesis of composites
of nitrogen-doped carbon quantum dots (NCDs) with γ-Fe2O3 (NCDs/γ-Fe2O3), which is
based on a hydrothermal cum co-precipitation method. The product is
a fine powder of particles having an average diameter of 9 ±
3 nm. The physical and chemical properties of NCDs/γ-Fe2O3 were studied, as well as the superconducting
quantum interference device and Mossbauer analysis of the magnetic
properties of these nanocomposites. The interaction of NCDs/γ-Fe2O3 nanocomposites with neuron-like cells was examined,
showing efficient uptake and low toxicity. Our research demonstrates
the use of the nanocomposites for imaging and for controlling the
cellular motility. The NCDs/γ-Fe2O3 nanocomposites
are promising because of their biocompatibility, photostability, and
potential selective affinity, paving the way for multifunctional biomedical
applications.

Introduction
Nanoscale materials
are emerging as a new area of research that
shows enormous potential for biological and clinical sciences. Among
the advanced nanomaterials used in fundamental and applied research,
carbon materials are some of the cheapest and most abundant in our
surroundings.1 Recently, fluorescent carbon
nanoparticles, namely, carbon quantum dots (CDs), have attracted the
attention of the scientific community because of their unique optical
and electronic properties.2 Moreover, the
CDs have low toxicity, outstanding water solubility, and biocompatibility.3 The fluorescence of CDs can be improved by nitrogen
doping, and such nitrogen-doped CDs (N@CDs, or NCDs) have already
been tested for various applications including fluorescent ratiometric,
pH sensing,4 in vivo bioimaging, drug delivery,
and photocatalysis.5−7 Hydrothermal synthesis is one of the commonly used
methods for preparing CDs and doped CDs.8,9

Another
attractive class of nanoparticles is magnetic nanoparticles,
iron oxides (FexOy) are an example. Iron oxides are important transition-metal
oxides. Because of their magnetic properties, they can be controlled
by external magnetic fields. Currently, iron oxide nanomaterials are
utilized in various biomedical applications, both in vitro and in
vivo, including biomagnetic separation, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) contrast,10 hyperthermia, cell imaging,11 and drug delivery.12,13 Specifically, iron oxide nanoparticles were shown to be effective
for neuronal repair and regeneration as they bestow promising capabilities
for remote guidance of neuronal motility and growth.14 Recent studies have demonstrated the use of iron oxide
nanoparticles for directing the orientation of neurite growth during
regeneration.15,16 Iron oxide nanoparticles have
also been used to guide progenitor neural cells through the blood
stream toward injured sites using an external magnet.17,18 Providing nanoparticles with fluorescence properties enables to
trace the location of these nanoparticles in cells or tissues during
cell imaging, disease analysis, and drug-targeting studies.19 There are only a few reports in the literature
on the synthesis of Fe2O3/CDs composites. Ma
et al. have just simply synthesized the functional magnetic fluorescent
Fe3O4/CDs composites by the thermal decomposition
method.20 Recently, Pramanik et al. reported
the fluorescent magnetic CDs nanoparticles for efficient separation,
differentiation, and eradication of superbugs.21 It is well-known that doping CDs with nitrogen enhances
their quantum yield. So far, CDs have been used mainly for fluorescence-based
diagnostics. The magnetic CDs were prepared to expand the range of
biomedical applications for which CDs can be used beyond bioimaging,
for example, being used in MRI.

In this work, we report on a
two-step synthesis of multifunctional
γ-Fe2O3/NCD hybrid nanocomposites. The
NCDs were synthesized from an aqueous solution of bovine serum albumin
(BSA) by a hydrothermal reaction followed by the second step of co-precipitation
with Fe(CO)5. We propose a mechanism for the formation
of these hybrid nanocomposites and investigate the long-lasting stability
of their fluorescence and magnetization. These properties were found
to be stable for more than four months. This remarkable stability
is reflected in the fluorescence as well as in the absence of precipitation.
We demonstrate the use of the nanocomposites for labeling neuron-like
cells and for controlling their motility by applying an external magnetic
field. These new NCDs/γ-Fe2O3 composites
exhibit low toxicity and good biocompatibility and may therefore be
beneficial as theranostic agents in various biomedical applications.

Results
and Discussion
The fine synthesized precipitates had a brownish
red color and
were analyzed by various physicochemical techniques and subsequently
exploited for long-lasting stability examination as well as for an
assessment of their biocompatibility. The γ-Fe2O3/NCDs hybrid nanocomposites were used as a probe for fluorescence
imaging of neuron-like cells (PC12 and SHSY-5Y), and their potential
for assisting neuronal differentiation was examined.

Physical and Chemical Characterization
of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs
The γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites were analyzed by various
methods, including
X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV, fluorescence, dynamic light scattering
(DLS), zeta potential measurements, superconducting quantum interference
device (SQUID), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). XRD analysis indicated that the particles
were highly crystalline with peaks matching the JCPDS powder diffraction
file of γ-Fe2O3 (no. 65-3107). It also
indicated the incorporation of γ-Fe2O3 in the NCDs. The presence of γ-Fe2O3 was identified in the products of the reactions with various ratios
of reactants, as indicated by the similar XRD patterns (Figure 1). Therefore, herein, only
the reaction with a 1:1 ratio (Fe(CO)5 and NCDs) is discussed.
XRD was also used to study the stability of the composite after different
time points. It can be seen in Figure 1 that the XRD pattern remains almost identical even
after 4 months in which the composite was kept at ambient conditions,
indicating the air stability of the product. The XRD pattern of γ-Fe2O3 (Figure 1e) is similar to that of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites. The broad nature of all the diffraction peaks
is due to the small size of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites and NCDs (Figure 1f).

Figure 1 The XRD pattern of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites
at ratios of (a) 1:2, (b) 1:1, (c) 2:1, (d) after 3 months (1:1 ratio),
(e) pristine γ-Fe2O3 and (f) NCDs.

The magnetic properties of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs
nanocomposites were characterized by SQUID and Mossbauer measurements
at 300 K. Figure 2a
depicts the measured magnetization curves demonstrating the superparamagnetic
characteristics of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites,
with saturation magnetization values of Ms ≈ 35 (2:1), 32 (1:1), and ∼21 (1:1) emu/g of the products.
On the basis of the XRD (Figure 1) and SQUID (Figure 2a) analyses, we identified the best sample as 1:1 (Fe(CO)5/NCDs) with the highest saturation magnetization. In addition,
we measured the magnetization of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs after 3 and 4 months and found that the value of Ms was hardly changed (from 32 to 31 emu/g, Figure 2). Hence, we conclude that
γ-Fe2O3/NCDs are highly stable materials
at room temperature and normal pressure. To determine the exact phase
of the iron in the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs, we performed
a Mossbauer analysis. The Mossbauer spectra of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs are presented in Figure 2b, showing a sextet with an isomer shift
[δ], line width, and effective hyperfine magnetic field [Heff] values of 0.44 ± 0.01 mm·s–1, 0.32 ± 0.04 mm·s–1,
and 487 ± 0.1 kOe, which is in accordance with γ-Fe2O3. The relative large line width indicates distribution
of hyperfine parameters and may also correspond to large blocked particles.

ratios (2:1, 1:2 and 1:1) and after 3 and 4 months (for the 1:1 ratio).
(b) Mossbauer analysis for the 1:1 Fe2O3/NCD
nanocomposite.

The morphology of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs was
observed by TEM (Figure 3). Spherical γ-Fe2O3/NCDs with sizes
in the range of ∼9 ± 3 nm were observed in the high-resolution
TEM (HRTEM) image (Figure 3c), which is close to the typical size range of pristine CDs,
indicating that the γ-Fe2O3 dopant has
a rather small effect in terms of the size and the shape of the nanoparticles.
The selected area electron diffraction (SAED, Figure 3d) reveals the phases of both NCDs (200)22,23 and γ-Fe2O3 (311, 400).24,25 The size distribution of γ-Fe2O3/NCD
particles was assessed also by DLS measurements, which showed that
the main population was within the size range of 12–20 nm with
a peak corresponding to 14 nm, which is in a good agreement with the
TEM observation (Figure S1, see the Supporting Information).

(inset: lattice fringes), and (d) SAED with marked lattice plane.

The fluorescence and absorption
spectra of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs (Figure 4) confirm that the synthesized
materials are fluorescent with
high magnetization. Figure 4a shows the fluorescence spectra of the bare NCD particles,
and Figure 4b shows
the fluorescence spectra at different excitation wavelengths (330,
350, 370, 390, 410, 430, 450, and 470 nm). The fluorescence intensity
of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs is reduced, and a blue
shift of the emission with respect to NCDs is observed. An excitation
spectrum was recorded also for γ-Fe2O3/NCDs, revealing a peak at 350 nm when the emission was collected
at 430 nm, in support of the UV–vis analysis (Figure 4d).

Plausible Speculative Formation Mechanism of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs
A speculative hypothesis for the
synthesis of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs from commercial
iron pentacarbonyl is mixed with an aqueous suspension of NCDs in
the presence of air; the Fe(CO)5 decomposes at 70 °C
in oxygen atmosphere to metallic iron nanoparticles, which act as
initiators for the growth of Fe/NCDs. All clustered metallic iron
atoms are oxidized to Fe2O3 to obtain γ-Fe2O3/NCDs as the final product. The γ-Fe2O3/NCDs nanocomposites are made more permeable
during this process because of expansion upon oxidation. Moreover,
the NCD oxygen functional groups facilitate the nucleation and growth
of the Fe2O3 nanoparticles.

Interaction
of γ-Fe2O3/NCD Nanocomposites
with the Living Cells
XTT cell viability assay was performed
to examine the cytotoxicity of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs. We tested the effect of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs on the viability of PC12 neural cells. The cells were incubated
with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs at concentrations ranging
from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/mL. Viability experiments were performed at time
points 24 and 72 h after exposure to γ-Fe2O3/NCDs, and the results were normalized to the control cells without
nanoparticles. PC12 cells that were treated with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs remained viable even after 72 h. No significant
difference in cell viability was observed at all doses (Figure 5a), indicating that the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs are not cytotoxic to PC12 cells. The cells
treated with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs also retained
their ability to differentiate (Figure 5b); they demonstrated neurite outgrowth and formed
a network, similar to control networks and to cells treated with other
nanoparticles, as we have shown previously.14,26 Different types of iron oxide nanoparticles demonstrate diverse
cytotoxic effects. Some particles are found to be toxic even at low
concentrations, whereas others exhibit biocompatible properties. The
toxicity of iron oxide particles depends on many factors including
particle stability, coating, and level of aggregation.27−29 The remarkable biocompatibility of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs enables us to use them in biological applications.

concentrations of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs after 24
and 72 h of incubation (n = 3). Results are normalized
to control without NCDs. (b) Light microscopy image of PC12 cells
treated with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs after four days
of differentiation.

We then studied the uptake
of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs by the cells and the effect
of the concentration on the cellular
uptake. PC12 cells were incubated for 24 h with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs at various concentrations (0.05–0.5 mg/mL),
and the intracellular fluorescence intensity was measured by flow
cytometry. Figure 6a shows the uptake of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs
nanocomposites by the cells; as can be seen in Figure 6b, the fluorescence increases proportionally
with increasing γ-Fe2O3/NCDs concentrations.

ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 mg/mL, for 24 h. (b) Average of fluorescence
intensity normalized to control without NCDs upon incubation of the
cells with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs.

Because of their fluorescent properties, γ-Fe2O3/NCDs can be detected within cells by fluorescent
confocal
microscopy. To verify particles’ internalization into cells,
we performed z-stack imaging and examined images
at an intracellular focal plane. We compared between cells incubated
with different particles: NCDs, Fe2O3 particles,
or γ-Fe2O3/NCDs composites. Figure 7 presents confocal microscopy
images of the cells at a single focal plane demonstrating the internalization
of the particles into the cells. A fluorescent signal is observed
in cells incubated with NCDs (Figure 7b) and in cells incubated with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs (Figure 7d). On the contrary, no fluorescence is detected in cells
incubated with Fe2O3 particles (Figure 7c), similar to control cells
without any particles (Figure 7a). Cell viability assay examined the cytotoxicity of NCDs
and Fe2O3 particles at concentrations ranging
from 0.05 to 0.25 mg/mL. No significant difference in cell viability
was observed at all doses after 24 h (Figure S3, Supporting Information). The incorporation of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs within cells enables magnetic cell manipulations.
As a proof of the concept, an external permanent magnet was placed
at one side of the culture dish. Time-lapse observations demonstrated
the movement of the γ-Fe2O3/NCD-treated
cells toward the magnet (Figure S4, Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In summary, we have successfully synthesized
γ-Fe2O3/NCD magnetic nanoparticles with
high fluorescence and
very good biocompatibility. The detailed formation is reported, along
with a physical and chemical analysis. These fluorescent magnetic
nanoparticles were also shown to be efficient for various neuronal
manipulations, including cell labeling and controlled cell motility
by means of magnetic force. The present approach offers new insight
into the production of cheap, highly sensitive, and selective materials
for various biomedical applications.

Experimental Methods
Chemicals
BSA, iron pentacarbonyl (Fe(CO)5), and quinine sulphate
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd., Israel.
Double-distilled water was used throughout the experiments. RPMI medium,
horse serum (HS), fetal bovine serum (FBS), l-glutamine,
penicillin–streptomycin, and amphotericin were purchased from
Biological Industries, Israel. Murine β-NGF was purchased from
Peprotech Ltd., Israel.

Synthesis of NCDs and γ-Fe2O3/NCD
Nanocomposites
The preparation of the NCDs was done by a
modified hydrothermal method starting from an aqueous solution of
BSA (0.5 w/v %).8 The procedure included
dissolution of 0.30 g of BSA (66.5 kD) in 60 mL of ultrapure water
and stirring for 10 min at room temperature. The resulting 0.5 w/v
% solution was transferred into a 100 mL Teflon-lined autoclave and
heated at 195 °C for 6 h in a hot-air oven. After completion,
the reaction was quenched by cooling the autoclave in water. The large
carbide slag was separated from the product solution by centrifugation
at 12 000 rpm for 10 min. A pale-yellow homogeneous transparent
suspension of NCDs was obtained. The concentration of the NCDs was
determined by UV–vis spectroscopy and was found to be 5 mg/mL.
This suspension (10–40 mL) was mixed with 10 mL of solution
of iron pentacarbonyl at 70 °C with stirring for 4 h under air
or N2 atmosphere, and it was found that more precipitates
were obtained under air. As stirring was stopped, red-brown particles
started to precipitate. Three different volumes of the NCD suspensions
were used to examine the effect of the reactant weight ratios (2:1,
1:1, and 1:2) on the product. The composite particles were separated
by evaporation of the water at 70 °C. A detailed schematic representation
of the reaction that takes place is shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Plausible Mechanism for the Formation of
the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs Nanocomposites
Cell Culture
Rat
pheochromocytoma PC12 cells (ATCC)
were cultivated in suspension in RPMI medium supplemented with 10%
HS, 5% FBS, 1% l-glutamine, 1% penicillin–streptomycin,
and 0.2% amphotericin. The neuron cells were cultured in a 5% CO2-humidified incubator at 37 °C. To induce differentiation,
cells were seeded on collagen type l-coated plates and incubated for
24 h in serum-reduced medium (1% HS). A day after plating, murine
β-NGF (50 ng/mL) was added to the cultures. The medium with
added β-NGF was replaced every 2–3 days.

Flow Cytometry
Analyses of Cellular Uptake
PC12 cells
were incubated with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs at concentrations
of 0.05, 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50 mg/mL. After 24 h, the cells were washed
twice with fresh medium and collected in the dark. The fluorescence
intensity was measured by flow cytometry (FACSAria III, BD Bioscience,
USA) with laser excitation at 405 nm and emission-filtered at 450
nm, with 40 nm band width.

Cell Viability Assay
The XTT assay
was used for a quantitative
assessment of the toxicity of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs. The XTT assay is based on the ability of metabolic active
cells to reduce the tetrazolium salt XTT to orange colored compounds
of formazan. The intensity of the dye is proportional to the number
of metabolic active cells. PC12 cells were seeded on 96-well plates
with γ-Fe2O3/NCDs at different concentrations
and cultured for 24 and 72 h. XTT reaction solution (Biological Industries,
Israel) was then added to the wells and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C.
Absorbance was measured at 450 nm (630 nm background) using a spectrophotometer
(BioTek Synergy 4, Vermont, USA).

Instruments and Analytical
Techniques
UV–vis
spectra of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs were measured
using a Cary 100 spectrophotometer (Varian) operated by Labsphere
software. The fluorescence of the γ-Fe2O3/NCDs suspension in water was measured by a fluorescence spectrophotometer
(Varian Cary Eclipse). The functional group of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs was analyzed by a Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer
(Bruker TENSOR 27, platinum ATR diamond F) in the range of 4000–400
cm–1. Elemental analysis was performed by EDS using a transmission electron microscope.
HRTEM analysis was carried out on a JEOL 2100 microscope, which was
operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The samples for TEM
were prepared by dropping an aqueous solution of γ-Fe2O3/NCDs in isopropanol on a gold-coated copper TEM grid
and then dried under vacuum at room temperature overnight. The C,
H, N, S, and O analyses were performed by CHNSO/O chromatogram spectroscopy.
Zeta potential measurements of the particles, as well as their size
distribution studies were performed on a ZetaSizer Nano-ZS (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, UK). The DLS was measured on the
same instrument in an aqueous solution. X-ray powder diffractograms
were obtained using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE diffractometer. Bragg–Bretano
geometry was adopted using Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.541
Å) and a setting of 40 kV and 40 mA. The phases were identified
using the JCPDS database. The magnetization measurements were conducted
by a Quantum Design MPMS5 SQUID magnetometer. The γ-Fe2O3 phase analysis was done using a Mossbauer spectrometer.
