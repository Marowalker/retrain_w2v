Graphene nanoplates
(GNPs) can be used as a platform for homogeneous
distribution of adsorbent nanoparticles to improve electron exchange
and ion transport for heavy-metal adsorption. In this study, we report
a facile thermal decomposition route to fabricate a graphene-supported
Fe–Mg oxide composite. The prepared composite was characterized using
scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive
spectrometry, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
Batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the arsenic adsorption
behavior of the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite. Both the Langmuir
and Freundlich models were employed to describe the adsorption isotherm,
in which the sorption kinetics of the arsenic adsorption process by
the composite was found to be pseudo-second-order. Furthermore, the
reusability and regeneration of the adsorbent were investigated by
an assembled-column filter test. The GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite
exhibited significant fast adsorption of arsenic over a wide range
of solution pHs, with exceptional durability and recyclability, which
could make this composite a very promising candidate for effective
removal of arsenic from aqueous solutions.

Introduction
Contamination
of water with toxic metals, such as arsenic (As),
lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg), has significantly increased over the
last few decades due to anthropogenic sources (industrialization and
urbanization). Because of their toxicity and carcinogenicity to human
beings, exposure to these elements poses a serious health risk.1 Among them, arsenic is one of the most toxic
elements and is widely present in nature through leaching from soils,
mining, fertilizers, industrial waste, biological activity, and As-containing
minerals.2,3 As a consequence, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has established a maximum recommended concentration of arsenic
in water of 10 ppb. Long-term ingestion of food grown in arsenic-contaminated
areas or directly drinking arsenic-contaminated water is linked to
kidney, skin, and lung cancers.4 Therefore,
it is urgent to remove arsenic from contaminated water to provide
safe drinking water with arsenic levels below the limit recommended
by the WHO. There are several approaches that have been used to remove
arsenic from water, including adsorption, ion exchange, reverse osmosis,
electrochemical treatment, membrane filtration, and co-precipitation.5−8 However, because of its simplicity, low cost, and high efficiency,
adsorption is widely employed and studied as a promising technology
for cost-effective arsenic removal.

Many materials have been
employed as adsorbents for arsenic adsorption,
such as agricultural and industrial wastes, surfactants, carbon-based
materials, polymers, and metal oxides.9,10 Among these,
metals and metal oxides, such as TiO2,11−13 nano zero-valent
iron,14,15 Fe2O3,4,16,17 Fe3O4,18 CeO2,19 CuO,20,21 CaO,22 and ZrO2,23,24 have been extensively studied for arsenic
treatment in aqueous solutions because of their high affinity to the
arsenic species, low cost, and tunability of adsorption capacity.10,25 Recently, considerable attention has been focused on the development
of adsorbent composites containing two or more metals and metal oxides
to maximize arsenic adsorption. For example, Shan and Tong fabricated
Fe–Mn binary oxides with a high adsorption capacity for arsenic.26 Also, superparamagenetic Mg0.27Fe2.5O4, a novel arsenic adsorbent, was synthesized
by Tang et al.27 In another report, Yu
et al. presented Fe–Ti binary oxide magnetic nanoparticles,
which combined the photocatalytic oxidation property of TiO2 with the high adsorption capacity and magnetic properties of γ-Fe2O3 for arsenic treatment.28 Xu et al. reported the synthesis and application of a CeO2–ZrO2 composite for the removal of arsenic from
aqueous solutions.29 Basu and Ghosh found
that Fe(III)–Al(III) mixed oxides and Fe(III)–Ce(IV)
oxides have a high adsorption capacity toward arsenic.30,31

Graphene, a two-dimensional material, has been attracting
significant
interest over the past decade due to its exceptional chemical and
physical properties, which can be applied to many different areas,
including, but not limited to, electronic devices, energy storage
and conversion, sensors, adsorption, and composites.32−37 Most recently, graphene has gained tremendous interest as a supporting
material for enhancement of the adsorption properties of adsorbents
due to its large surface area, high conductivity, ionic mobility,
and superior mechanical flexibility. For example, Gollavelli et al.
reported a smart magnetic graphene that removed heavy metals from
drinking water.38 A hybrid of monolithic
Fe2O3/graphene was also fabricated and showed
favorable properties for arsenic removal.39 Reduced graphene oxide-supported mesoporous Fe2O3/TiO2 nanoparticles synthesized by a sol–gel
route showed high adsorption toward arsenic.40 Kumar et al. synthesized single-layer graphene oxide with manganese
ferrite magnetic nanoparticles for efficient removal of arsenic from
contaminated water.41

Herein, we
report a simple one-pot hydrothermal method to prepare
a GNP-supported Fe–Mg binary oxide (GNP/Fe–Mg oxide)
composite. The obtained material was well characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive
spectrometry (EDS), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Arsenic adsorption
was employed to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent.
The effects of the parameters, including the Fe/Cu ratio, graphene
loading, initial arsenic concentration, adsorption time, and solution
pH, on arsenic adsorption were investigated through batch experiments,
and a column test was also used to study the recyclability of the
sorbent.

Results and Discussion
The morphologies of the prepared
graphene nanoplates (GNPs) and
free-standing Fe–Mg oxide were studied by SEM, and the images
are shown in Figure 1. It can be clearly seen in Figure 1A that the obtained GNPs have a crumpled, wrinkled
morphology, with a diameter of tens of microns and thickness <20
nm.42 The SEM image of the as-prepared
Fe–Mg binary oxide is shown in Figure 1B, which indicates that the Fe–Mg
oxide consists of ultrafine nanocrystallites. The morphology of the
Fe–Mg oxide is consistent with that in a previous study.27 We believe that the metal ions first physically
adsorbed onto the GNPs and then reacted under hydrothermal
conditions to form metal oxides on the GNPs.

Figure 1 SEM images of (A) GNPs
and (B) free-standing Fe–Mg oxide.

SEM and TEM images of the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite
are
shown in Figure 2.
In the low-magnification SEM and TEM images (Figure 2A–C), it is clear that Fe–Mg
oxides are well formed and dispersed on the surface of GNPs. When
the composite is viewed at higher SEM and TEM magnifications, as shown
in Figure 2D and insets
of Figure 2B,D, it
can be seen that Fe–Mg oxides on graphene are not well-defined
nanocrystallites, with some agglomeration observed, which might be
ascribed to the amorphous nature of Fe–Mg binary oxides on the
GNPs. The amorphous nature of the Fe–Mg oxide formed on the
GNPs is further confirmed by the XRD pattern of the composite (Figure S1). In the XRD pattern, apart from the
peaks with an asterisk, which are attributed to the crystallites of
GNPs,42,43 the presence of very weak and broad peaks
in region of 30–80° indicates the amorphous nature of
the Fe–Mg oxide.

Figure 2 (A, B) SEM images and (C, D) TEM images of the
GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide composite.

EDS mapping was undertaken to study the elemental distribution
in the GNP-supported Fe–Mg oxide composite, as exhibited in Figure 3. It can be clearly
seen from the figure that the Mg–Fe oxide uniformly covers
the entire GNP surface.

composite: (A)
overlapping elements; (B) C; (C) Mg; and (D) Fe.

To explore the chemical states of C, Fe, Mg, and O in the
composite,
the core-level XPS spectra of C 1s, Fe 2p, Mg 1s, and O 1s and their
corresponding deconvolutions showing the contributions of the individual
components are shown in Figure 4. The C1 s spectrum (Figure 4A) has two major peaks at 284.1 and 284.8 eV, which
correspond to carbon in C=C (sp2) and C–C
(sp3) bonds,44 respectively,
of graphenic carbons. Deconvoluted core-level Fe 2p shows two dominant
peaks at 711.4 and 724.5 eV, with satellites corresponding to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2 of the Fe3+ state, respectively.45Figure 4C shows the binding energy and its deconvolution spectrum
for core-level Mg 1s. There is only one peak observed at 1303.5 eV,
which could be attributed to MgO.46 In
the O 1s spectrum (Figure 4D), the peaks at 530.1 and 531.4 eV are due to the presence
of O2– in Fe2O3 and MgO, respectively.39,47 Interestingly, the appearance of the peak at 532.2 eV demonstrates
the existence of Fe–OH in the composite, which enhances the
adsorption capacity for heavy ions.48,49 There is also
the existence of a peak at 533.8 eV, which is ascribed to the Si–O
bond used as a substrate for the XPS investigation.

XPS spectra of C 1s (A), Fe 2p (B), Mg 1s (C), and O
1s (D) obtained for the GNP/Fe–Mg binary oxide composite.

The thermal properties of the
prepared GNP-supported Fe–Mg
oxide composite
were investigated by TGA, as presented in Figure 5. The TGA curve shows a two-step decomposition
process. The first weight loss in the range of 30–150 °C
is 0.52%, which can be attributed to the removal of adsorbed and trapped
water in the composite. The weight loss of 0.93% in the second step
(300–550 °C) is due to the decomposition of Fe(OH)3 to α-Fe2O3.

Figure 5 TGA of the GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide composite.

Figure 6A
shows
the effect of various Mg/Fe weight ratios on arsenic adsorption,
with an initial As(V) concentration of 10 mg/L, an adsorbent dose
of 200 mg/L, a pH of 7, and at room temperature. The results indicate
that As(V) sorption by GNP-supported Fe–Mg oxide significantly
increases with a decrease in the Mg/Fe weight ratio, and it reaches
a maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity of 40.3 mg/g when the Mg/Fe
ratio is 5:5. Then, As(V) adsorption slowly declines with a further
decrease in the Mg/Fe weight ratio. It is also of note that As(V)
sorption by GNP–Fe2O3 (31 mg/L) is somewhat
higher than that by GNP–MgO (2 mg/L). The effect of the GNP
load on the As(V) sorption capacity by the composite was also investigated,
with an initial As(V) concentration of 9.5 mg/L, as shown in Figure 6B. It is obvious
that when the GNP loading increases the As(V) sorption increases,
and it reaches a maximum of approximately 37.5 mg/g at the GNP/Mg–Fe
oxide weight ratio of 2:1. When the GNP load is further increased,
the sorption capacity significantly decreases, and without Fe–Mg
oxide, the As(V) sorption capacity by pure GNPs is only 2.38 mg/g.
These results suggest that the combination of GNPs and Fe–Mg
oxide significantly improves As(V) adsorption.

Figure 6 Effect of (A) the Mg/Fe
weight ratio and (B) GNP loading on As(V)
adsorption by GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composites.

The adsorption isotherm was obtained to assess the
arsenic
adsorption and determine the maximum As(V) adsorption capacity of
the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite. The amount of arsenic adsorbed
onto the composite at equilibrium (qe)
was calculated from the As(V) concentration difference, with the following
equation 1  where C0 (mg/L)
is the initial concentration, Ce (mg/L)
is the equilibrium concentration, V (L) is the solution
volume, and m (g) is the mass of the GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide adsorbent.

Figure 7 shows the
arsenic adsorption
capacity of the composite at equilibrium at various As(V) concentrations,
in range of 5–90 mg/L; an adsorbent dose of 200 mg/g;
pH 7; and at room temperature. The Langmuir and Freundlich
adsorption isotherm models were employed to fit the data, as
expressed in eqs 2 and 3, respectively 2   3  where qe is the
amount of arsenic adsorbed onto the solid phase at equilibrium (mg/g), qmax (mg/g) is the maximum arsenic adsorption
capacity per unit weight of adsorbent, Ce is the equilibrium arsenic concentration (mg/L), KL is the equilibrium adsorption constant representing
the affinity of binding sites (L/mg), KF is the Freundlich constant, and n is the heterogeneity
factor.

Figure 7 Adsorption isotherm for As(V) adsorption by the GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide composite.

The obtained adsorption constants are presented in Table 1. The higher correlation
coefficient
(0.985) value of the fitted Freundlich plot compared to that of the
Langmuir plot (0.935) suggests that the Freundlich model is more suitable
for representing the adsorption behavior of As(V) by the GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide composite than the Langmuir model. The low calculated heterogeneity
factor (n = 0.4) also suggests that the Freundlich
model is the more favorable model to describe arsenic adsorption by GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide. These results indicate that As(V) is heterogeneously adsorbed
onto the composite surface, which could be attributed to the simultaneous
existence of graphene, iron, and magnesium oxides in the solid phase.
The maximum As(V)-adsorption capacity of GNP/Fe–Mg oxide
determined from the Langmuir model is 103.9 mg/g, which indicates
that the composite is very effective for arsenic removal. Illustrated
in Table 2 is a comparison
of the As(V) adsorption capacity of the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite
with that of other adsorbents. It is obvious from the comparison that
the adsorption capacity of GNP/Fe–Mg oxide outperforms that
of the majority of other adsorbents, which could make this material
a promising sorbent for arsenic removal.

The adsorption kinetics of
As(V) was obtained to further
understand the adsorption behavior of As(V) on the GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide surface. Figure 8 shows the adsorption data with an initial As(V) concentration of
5 mg/L at different time intervals. The adsorption process reaches
equilibrium within 3 h. The pseudo-second-order model was applied
to describe the kinetic data, as expressed in eq 4 4  where qt (mg/g)
is the amount of arsenic adsorbed on the solid phase at time t (h), qe (mg/g) is the amount
of arsenic adsorbed on the solid phase at equilibrium, and K is the adsorption rate constant
(g mg h). According to the adsorption kinetic values listed in Table 3, the experimental
data are relatively well fitted, with a correlation coefficient of
0.957. This result implies that the adsorption process might be chemical
adsorption accompanied by electron exchange between the composite
and arsenic.56 Furthermore, the experimental
adsorption capacity at equilibrium of the composite (22.4 mg/g) with
an initial As(V) concentration of 5 mg/L is close to the calculated
value from the pseudo-second-order model (25.5 mg/g).

The
effect of solution pH on arsenic adsorption by the GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide composite was determined with an initial As(V) concentration
of 10 mg/L, as shown in Figure 9. It can be clearly seen that As(V) sorption is significantly
dependent upon the pH. Under acidic conditions, arsenic adsorption
slowly increases with an increase in solution pH, and it reaches a
maximum capacity under neutral conditions (pH 7). The adsorption capacity
significantly decreases under mild basic conditions (pH 8–9)
before greatly declining when the solution pH further increases. This phenomenon
may be attributed to the dependence of the adsorption of strong acid
anions by metal oxides and hydroxides on solution pH.57 The dissolution of Fe and Mg in the GNP/Fe–Mg
oxide composite at pH 7 was also recorded, as shown
in Figure S2. It is obvious that the release
of Fe and Mg is minimal compared with As(V) adsorption, which indicates
that the GNP/Fe–Mg binary oxide composite is a stable and effective
adsorbent for arsenic. As the source of GNPs in this study does not
contain −COOH or −OH groups, the adsorption of arsenic
on GNPs is mostly physical adsorption. However, when Mg–Fe
oxide is loaded onto GNPs, there exists −OH groups on the surface
of the metal oxide in aqueous solution (especially under the optimum
pH condition). These −OH groups are responsible for the dramatic
increase in arsenic adsorption due to electrostatic attraction.

Figure 9 Effect
of solution pH on As(V) adsorption by the GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide composite.

As electrostatic attraction is a main force, which
is responsible
for the adsorption of As(V) on graphene–metal oxide composites,50,52 the change in the electrostatic force between As(V) and the GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide composite may explain the effect of pH on As(V)
adsorption. At a low pH, the adsorbent of GNP/Fe–Mg oxide has
a net positive charge due to protonation of the −OH groups
in the Fe–Mg binary oxide. As a result, they attract negatively
charged As(V) anions, which leads to greater adsorption. When
the pH increases, the positive charge decreases, resulting in a decrease
in As(V) adsorption.

The selectivity of the GNP/Fe–Mg
binary oxide adsorbent
toward arsenic in the presence of common metal ions that exist in
drinking water, such as Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+, was studied (Figure S3). It can be seen that whereas more than 95% of the arsenic was adsorbed
there was an insignificant amount of Na+, K+, and Ca2+ ions adsorbed onto the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide
composite. Interestingly, the concentration of Mg2+ in
the tested solution increased by 10% after adsorption due to
the release of Mg from the adsorbent.

To evaluate the recyclability,
a filter column with a diameter
of 2 cm and height of 10 cm was assembled, as shown in Figure 10. The mass of the
GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite used was 200 mg. The adsorption process
was carried out with 10 mL of flow solution (pH 7) of 3 mg/L As(V).
After adsorption, the filter column was washed with 20 mL of 2 M NaOH
solution to regenerate the adsorbent before the next test cycle. The
adsorption–regeneration process was repeated for five cycles.
An insignificant decrease in the removal efficiency (less than 2%)
after five cycles suggests that the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite
has a high durability for arsenic removal.

Experimental Section
Materials
Natural graphite flakes
were supplied from
Pressol Gmbh, with particle size >100 mesh. Chemicals, such as
dry
acetone, ethanol, concentrated sulfuric acid (98%), sodium hydroxide
(NaOH), potassium hydroxide (KOH), ethanol, sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8), MgCl2·6H2O, and anhydrous FeCl3, were purchased from Ajax
Finechem. All chemicals were used as received.

Synthesis of GNPs
Preparation of GNPs was undertaken
according to previous methods.42 Typically,
1 g of natural graphite flakes was dispersed in 80 mL of sulfuric
acid (98%), with swirling for 10 min, in a 250 mL reactor. Thereafter,
10 g of sodium persulfate (Na2S2O8) was gradually added and the reaction mixture was gently stirred
for 3 h at room temperature. The mixture was then filtered with a
sintered glass filter (Duran sintered with a disc filter funnel of
capacity 50 mL; maximum pore size, 4–5 μm) without quenching.
The filtrate solution was separated and used for graphene exfoliation.
The GNPs thus obtained were rinsed with dry acetone (3 × 10 mL)
followed by 5 mL of water to remove any residual acid on the GNPs
and dried at 60 °C in open air.

Synthesis of the GNP/Fe–Mg
Binary Oxide Composite
GNP/Fe–Mg binary oxide composites
were fabricated by a simple
one-pot hydrothermal strategy. First, MgCl2·6H2O and FeCl3 with various Mg/Fe weight ratios, 10:0,
9:1, 7:3, 5:5, 3:7, 1:9, and 0:10, were dissolved in 50 mL of ethanol.
Then, GNPs with different loadings were dispersed in the solution
mixture by sonication for 10 min and stirring for 1 h. Subsequently,
a 2 M NaOH solution was added dropwise into the solution under vigorous
stirring until a pH of ∼8 or 9 was reached. After 1 h of further
stirring, the reaction solution was transferred and sealed in a Teflon-lined
autoclave and placed in an oven preheated to 150 °C for 2 h.
Then, the solution was cooled to room temperature and the precipitate
was filtered and washed three times each with ethanol and distilled
water. The sample was dried overnight at a temperature of 60 °C
in air to obtain the GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composites.

Characterization
The structures and mapping elemental
compositions of the samples were studied by EDS-equipped scanning
electron microscopy (SEM), using an FEI Nova NanoSEM (Hillsboro) operating
under high-vacuum conditions, with an accelerating voltage
of 30 keV and an Everhart–Thornley detector. TEM images
were obtained on a JEOL 1010 TEM instrument, operated at an accelerating
voltage of 100 kV. Thermal
analysis was performed on a TGA instrument from Perkin-Elmer, with
a furnace, a microbalance, an operating temperature from 35
to 800 °C, and a heating rate of 20 °C/min. A BrukerAXS
D8 Discover instrument with a general area detector diffraction system
using a Cu Kα source was utilized to obtain XRD patterns. XPS
spectra were obtained on a K-Alpha XPS instrument using monochromated
aluminum as the X-ray source. C 1s, Fe 2p, Mg 1s, and O 1s
core-level spectra were recorded with an overall resolution of 0.1
eV. The core-level spectra were background-corrected using the Shirley
algorithm, and chemically distinct species were resolved using a nonlinear
least-squares fitting procedure.

Adsorption Studies
A stock solution of 1000 ppm As(V)
was prepared by dissolving As2O5 in water. The
arsenic concentration was determined using an Agilent 4200 microwave
plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (MP-AES). All samples were analyzed
within 24 h after filtration.

Effects of the Mg/Fe Weight Ratio and GNP
Loading on Arsenic
Sorption 
Adsorption experiments were carried out
in closed glass vessels. Typically, 10 mg of each adsorbent, prepared
from different Mg/Fe weight ratios and various GNP loadings, was added
into glass vessels containing 50 mL of 10 mg/L arsenic solution at pH
7. The solution was kept shaking at 200 rpm at room temperature for
24 h. Then, all samples were filtered to remove the adsorbent and
the concentration of arsenic in the residual solutions was analyzed.

Adsorption Isotherm
In glass vessels, 10 mg of the
optimally fabricated adsorbent was added to 50 mL of arsenic
solution, with initial concentrations ranging from 5 to 90 mg/L. Adsorption
was carried out at a solution pH of 7 at room temperature, stirring
at a speed of 200 rpm for 24 h. The mixtures were then filtered and
analyzed for residual arsenic by MP-AES.

Adsorption Kinetics
In a typical experiment, 40 mg
of the GNP/Fe–Mg binary oxide was mixed with 200 mL of 5 mg/L
arsenic in a glass vessel. The
mixed solution was shaken at 200 rpm on an orbital shaker, at room
temperature and pH 7. At certain time intervals, 10
mL of the mixture was taken, filtered, and analyzed for arsenic.

Effect of Solution pH
The GNP/Fe–Mg oxide composite
(10 mg) was added to 50 mL of 10 mg/L arsenic at various solution
pH values, ranging from 4 to 11 (the pH values were adjusted with
dilute HCl and NaOH solutions). The suspensions were shaken at a speed
of 200 rpm at room temperature for 24 h. Then, all samples were filtered
and the residual arsenic concentrations were determined.

Recyclability
Test
The reusability of the prepared
adsorbent was studied by a column test. The GNP/Fe–Mg oxide
composite was assembled as a part of a filter column. Other parts
included a glass tube with both ends wrapped with a few layers of
filter paper and cotton. After each arsenic adsorption cycle, the
filter column was regenerated by washing it several times with 2 M
NaOH before implementing the next experiment.
