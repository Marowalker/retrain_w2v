In biology, the activity
of enzymes is usually regulated by feedback
loops, which enables direct communication between enzymes and the
state of the cell. In a similar manner, with the intention to have
automated activity regulation, the therapeutic effect of a photosensitizer
(BOD1) is shown to be reduced through a negative feedback
loop initiated by the photosensitizer. Photodynamic action produces
cytotoxic 1O2 and this reactive oxygen species
reacts with ascorbate, generating H2O2. Peroxide-mediated
oxidation of the photosensitizer auxiliary group leads to the formation
of inactive BOD2 from the parent photosensitizer. BOD1 is shown to accumulate in mitochondria, and cell viability
is shown to decrease significantly with BOD1 compared
to the loop end product, BOD2. Photoinduced enhancement
of fluorescence indicates the formation of inactive BOD2 under cellular conditions, and enhanced fluorescence acts as a reporter
for the activity of the photosensitizer. We present the first example
of PDT autoinactivation, and such a feedback control mechanism would
enable a decrease in post-therapy side effects.

Introduction
Autoacting or self-regulatory
molecular networks provide higher
level control over many complex systems of diverse disciplines, including
biology, economics, and engineering.1 Various
complex biological processes, including pattern formation, limb development,
and circadian clocks, are controlled by the interaction between pathway
elements via feedback loops, maintaining homeostasis at every level
from molecular biology of the cell to ecology.2−5 Amplification of the signal or
self-inhibition is maintained by self-acting elements mainly either
by autoactivation through a positive loop or by product inhibition
via a negative loop, respectively. Recently, this higher order control
behavior has also been explored/mimicked in nonbiological systems.
In the late 20th century, pioneering works on template-assisted self-replication
with artificial replicants were reported.6−8 The first asymmetric
autocatalysis was achieved when a chiral product acted as a chiral
catalyst to make more of itself, and still many more autocatalytic
molecular systems are being reported.9,10 Raymo reported
autocatalytic fluorescence photoactivation based on product amplification
through energy-transfer-dependent photochemical generation of anthracene
derivatives.11 The Aprahamian group reported
a communicating molecular system in which a Zn2+-dependent
hydrazone switch is regulated by a negative feedback loop; the loop
is initiated when Zn2+-mediated release of a proton from
the switch results in the formation of an imine, which sequesters
Zn2+, thereby inhibiting the switch.12 Feedback-dependent control over catalytic activity or amplification
of the signal is also reported by several groups.13,14 In biology, the activity of enzymes is usually finely tuned by means
of feedback regulation, which enables a communication among the state
of the cell, concentration of the product, etc.1 Likely, control of activity by means of self-acting systems
would enable selective and efficient therapies, and this potential
is yet to be explored. Once optimized, such a therapeutic system would
enable communication with the disease state and allow autocontrol
over therapeutic activity.

Here, we report a photodynamic therapy
(PDT) agent whose activity
is regulated through a negative feedback loop (Scheme 1). PDT is an oxygen- and light-dependent
noninvasive method mainly used to treat surface tumors and certain
skin diseases.15 To improve the selectivity
of the therapy various activatable photosensitizers (PSs) are reported.16−22 Activity control in these literature examples is maintained by inducing
disease-specific chemical and/or physical transformation on the PS.
pH-, glutathione-, and enzyme-mediated conversions are the most widely
used methods to change the PS from an inactive to an active state.
To the best of our knowledge, so far, a PS with an autocontrol behavior
has not been investigated. In this study, singlet oxygen (1O2) produced by a photosensitizer acts back on the PS
through a H2O2 intermediate, to reduce the efficiency
of PDT action (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Mechanism of Self-Inhibitory Feedback Control over PS. BOD1 Generates 1O2 upon Irradiation. 1O2 Is Converted into H2O2 through
Reaction with Ascorbate
H2O2 oxidizes
boronate and spontaneous 1,4-elimination produces inactive BOD2

To incorporate autoinhibition, H2O2-responsive
BODIPY, BOD1, is used (Scheme 1). BOD1 bears a boronic ester
in the structure, which is known to be oxidized by H2O2.23 1,4-Elimination on alkoxy methyl
phenol follows spontaneously to generate pyridine BODIPY from a pyridinium
precursor. This behavior is used to develop H2O2 sensors by others, since fluorescence is enhanced as pyridinium
with charge transfer properties is transformed into pyridine.24 In this work, BOD1 is used as a
PS. PDT action is mediated by 1O2, which can
only be generated when energy transfer to O2 takes place
following an intersystem crossing (ISC). Spin-forbidden ISC is either
facilitated by a heavy atom or special orientation of the PSs.25,26 Ziessel et al. reported that halogen-free pyridinium BODIPYs also
display high ISC through the charge transfer state.27 Despite this finding, heavy-atom-free pyridinium BODIPYs
have not been used as PSs to date. Here, BOD1 with similar
features is used for this purpose. Pyridine BODIPY lacking charge
transfer character is not expected to display efficient 1O2 generation. Based on this knowledge, we create a loop
that generates BOD2 (inefficient PS) from BOD1 (active PS) through PDT activity of BOD1. Reactions
involved in the loop are as follows: 1O2 generated
by BOD1 reacts with ascorbate to generate H2O2.28 H2O2 then reacts with boronate and ineffective BOD2 is produced
as an end product (Scheme 1). Ascorbate, which is found in every cell, is chosen to be
an intermediate loop element to enable communication between PS activity
and the cell.

Results and Discussion
BOD1 and BOD2 are synthesized as described
in the literature.24 Loop end product BOD2 is proposed to be less active, and it has been claimed
that it can be generated by the PDT action of BOD1. To
compare the PDT activities of these two compounds, relative 1O2 generation efficiencies are analyzed using the 1O2 trap molecule, 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF).
The absorbance of DPBF is known to decrease as a result of the reaction
of furan with 1O2.29 A comparison of the change in DPBF absorption in the presence of BOD1 and BOD2 indicates that the latter has significantly
lower activity, consistent with the design (Figure 1). None of the compounds produces 1O2 in the dark.

Figure 1 Relative 1O2 generation
by BOD1 and BOD2 (10 μM, in isopropanol)
followed by
a change in the absorption of DPBF (50 μM). Samples are kept
in the dark for 15 min and illuminated by 506 nm LED light for 80
min. Red: DPBF; blue: DPBF in the presence of BOD2; green:
DPBF in the presence of BOD1.

In the design, product inhibition is expected to be mediated
by
the reaction of the PDT product (1O2) with ascorbate
and this reaction generates H2O2. Selective
reaction of BOD1 with peroxide produces fluorescent BOD2.24 Thus, feedback loop analysis
is performed by following changes in the fluorescence of BOD1 in the presence or absence of ascorbate (Figure 2). Fluorescence is expected to increase as BOD2 is produced. For this to take place, 1O2 must react with ascorbate to generate H2O2 (Scheme 1).
Fluorescence increase in the presence of ascorbate (blue) is significantly
higher than that in the control lacking ascorbate (red). This result
indicates that ascorbate is needed to generate BOD2.

Figure 2 Change
in fluorescence intensity at 515 nm as BOD1 (10 μM,
in isopropanol) is converted into BOD2. In the presence
of sodium ascorbate and light, a loop is initiated,
and H2O2 is generated (Scheme 1). Due to H2O2-dependent
degradation of the boronate moiety on BOD1, fluorescent BOD2 is generated. The change in fluorescence intensity is
more pronounced in the presence of sodium ascorbate. Samples are irradiated
with a 506 nm LED lamp.

Fluorescence quantum yields are calculated to be 0.04 and
0.31
for BOD1 and BOD2, respectively (Table S1). Consistently, upon irradiation in
the presence of ascorbate, the quantum yield of BOD1 is
increased to 0.16, approaching the value for BOD2.

We hypothesize that due to reactions given in Scheme 1, 1O2 generation efficiency
is expected to decrease in the presence of
ascorbate. Consistently, the decrease in the absorption of DPBF becomes
less pronounced in the presence of increasing amounts of ascorbate
(0, 0.2, and 1 mM, Figure 3).

Figure 3 1O2 generation by BOD1 (10 μM,
in isopropanol) in the presence or absence of sodium ascorbate (0.2
mM shown in blue or 1 mM shown in purple) as followed by the change
in the absorption of DPBF (50 μM) at 411 nm. The sample lacking
sodium ascorbate (red) produces more 1O2 and
DPBF alone does not decompose under experimental conditions (green).
Samples are kept in the dark for the first 30 min and then irradiated
with 506 nm LED light for 110 min.

This can be a result of a combinatorial effect: one reason
being
direct scavenging of 1O2 by ascorbate and the
second one is conversion of BOD1 to a less efficient
PS. Figure 3 supports
this hypothesis, showing that the change in the absorption of DPBF
upon irradiation decreases in the presence of ascorbate. As shown
in Figure S1, during the PDT activity,
the absorbance of BOD1 at 510 nm is shown to decrease
and the absorbance at 505 nm is elevated. The new peak at 505 nm overlaps
with BOD2 absorbance, supporting the formation of this
molecule by PDT.

As mentioned above, one reason for the ascorbate-dependent
decrease
during PDT shown in Figure 3 can be scavenging, namely, ascorbate may react and remove 1O2. To show that the decrease in 1O2 generation by BOD1 in the presence of various
amounts of ascorbate results mainly from conversion to BOD2 rather than removal of 1O2, a control experiment
was done. BOD2 which lacks a peroxide-sensitive group
is used as the PS and 1O2 generation efficiencies
are analyzed in the presence and absence of ascorbate (Figure S2). It has been shown that when BOD2 is used as the photosensitizer, the change in the absorption
of DPBF does not display a significant variation upon use of ascorbate.
This clearly indicates that removal of 1O2 from
the solution by reaction with ascorbate has a minimal effect on the
observed data shown in Figure 3. Since 1O2 is catalytically produced
by the PS, this effect is negligible. Instead, quenching of the 1O2 producer (PS) through loop control seems to
be the major regulator of PDT activity.

Fluorescence enhancement
and spectral shift in absorption during
PDT action of BOD1 give clues about BOD1-to-BOD2 conversion (Figures 2 and S1). To further
demonstrate that BOD2 is generated via PDT activity,
the 1H NMR spectrum of BOD1 is analyzed before
and after irradiation in the presence of ascorbate (Figure 4). When the sample is irradiated
for 80 min, BOD2 peaks resonating at 8.73, 7.44, and
6.22 ppm appear in the spectrum. Disappearance of BOD1 signals indicates that it is converted completely to either an intermediate
oxidation product or BOD2. Calculations of the ratio
of BOD2 peak integrals to other peaks indicate 32% conversion
to BOD2. Considering the duration of PDT application
(usually 1 or more hours), the product ratio within a given time is
acceptable. Other oxidation products and 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol are
also produced consistent with the literature.24 High-resolution ESI-MS (HRMS) spectra of the samples after PDT assay
show that BOD2 is generated in ascorbate-containing experiments
(Figure S3). When the sample is extracted
with chloroform after analysis, 1H NMR shows that the only
compound remaining in the organic phase is BOD2 (Figure S4), showing that PDT-dependent reactions
do not produce a significant amount of (if any) byproducts soluble
in organic solvents. NMR analysis is performed in dimethyl sulfoxide
instead of isopropanol due to poor solubilities of ascorbate and PS
in the latter solvent at high concentrations.

(400 MHz, DMSO-d6) of BOD1 (25 mM) (a) alone and (b) in the presence
of saturated sodium ascorbate and light. (a) Upon irradiation with
506 nm light for 80 min, peaks of BOD2 appear. (c) 1H NMR spectrum of BOD2. Structures of products
are given on the top of the spectra.

Although BOD1 is soluble in aqueous media in
micromolar
concentrations, in situ PDT experiments are performed in isopropanol
due to the lack of solubility of BOD2 and DPBF in water.
To check degradation-dependent fluorescence enhancement, a stability
analysis is performed in neutral and slightly acidic buffer. Over
24 h, no significant fluorescence enhancement of BOD1 is observed, indicating BOD1 is stable over the experimental
time scale (Figure S5). Selective oxidation
of boronic ester bearing compounds (including BOD1) by
H2O2 is reported by independent groups.23,24,30,31 To demonstrate that the loop requires H2O2, 1O2-mediated conversion to BOD2 is analyzed by 1H NMR in the presence of a H2O2 scavenger, sodium pyruvate.32,33 Even though the reaction mixture contains ascorbate, photoconversion
to BOD2 failed, indicating the necessity of H2O2 for PS inactivation (Figure S6).

Cationic BOD1 (with IC50 of 69 μM)
localizes in the mitochondria of DLD-1 (Figure 5a).(33) Mitochondrial targeting is an advantage
for PDT, since in cancer tissues (to which this therapy is applied
most), the oxygen level is much less than that in healthy tissues.34 On the other hand, PDT requires O2. Indeed, targeting oxygen-rich organelle of hypoxic cancer tissue
is reported to enhance PDT action.35

Figure 5 (a) Fluorescent
micrograft of BOD1-introduced DLD-1 cells. Cells
are treated with 10 μM H2O2 prior to addition
of BOD1 to observe fluorescence. Cells are stained with MitoTracker
Red. (b) BOD1 or BOD2 (10 μM) is introduced into DLD-1 cells.
After irradiation with a 506 nm LED for 2 h, cell viability is determined
by Alamar Blue.

In this work, BOD2 is produced by loop reactions and
proposed to be less efficient. To demonstrate the relative PDT actions
of photosensitizers in cell culture, they are introduced into DLD-1
cells (Figure 5b).
Cell viability assay indicates that neither of the compounds has dark
toxicity. However, upon irradiation, viability drops down to 20% with BOD1. BOD2 has no significant cytotoxicity, consistent
with the proposed design. That is, BOD1 is inactivated
when it is converted into BOD2. Results of cell culture
experiments indicate that within 2 h significant cell death is induced
(Figure 5) and, at
the same time, within this time scale, the photosensitizer is converted
to inactive fluorescent BOD2 (Figure S6).

To understand the activity-reporting property of BOD1 and photogeneration of BOD2, cells are exposed
to 506
nm light for 6 h. Although initially there is no fluorescence, in
1 h, fluorescence is enhanced significantly (Figure S7). Within 6 h, fluorescence starts to decrease slightly which
would be due to leakage of uncharged BOD2 from the cell.
Fluorescence increase within the first hours of irradiation is attributed
to the formation of BOD2. Control samples kept in the
dark for 6 h do not show any fluorescence, which supports the hypothesis
that photogenerated H2O2 (not cellular peroxide)
leads to the formation of fluorescent BOD2. Together
with the relative PDT activities of BOD1 and BOD2, photo-autoinactivation of BOD1 under cellular conditions
is evident (Figure 5 and S7). In addition, since fluorescence
enhancement is a result of PDT action, it allows monitoring PS activity.

Conclusions
In conclusion, a halogen-free PS is shown to be self-inhibited. 1O2 generated by the PS is converted into H2O2, which in turn reacts with the PS and decreases
the PDT activity. Fluorescence, UV–vis absorption spectra, 1H NMR analysis, and HRMS results prove the formation of BOD2 in the presence of ascorbate and light. BOD2 is shown to be less effective at inducing apoptosis in cells. Fluorescence
enhancement, as BOD1 is converted into BOD2, can be observed in the cell (Figure S7). It is demonstrated that H2O2 generated through
PDT (not cellular peroxide) produces BOD2. The proposed
feedback loop control is shown in Figure 6. Since the boronate group of BOD1 selectively
reacts with hydrogen peroxide and cellular peroxide is not sufficient
to react with this group, the results suggest that the activity can
be autocontrolled via the proposed steps in vivo.

Figure 6 (a) Schematic representation
of autoinhibition and activity reporting.
Initially (t < 1 h), BOD1 efficiently
produces 1O2 and induces cell death. With time
(t >1 h), fluorescent and inactive BOD2 is generated, enabling silencing of the PDT action and activity
reporting. (b) Proposed mechanism of negative feedback loop initiated
by and acting on the photosensitizer, BOD1, (i) 1O2 is generated upon irradiation; (ii) 1O2 induces cell death, at the same time, some of the 1O2 reacts with cellular ascorbate to generate H2O2; (iii) H2O2 oxidizes BOD1, produces fluorescent BOD2, and, as a result,
decreases PDT efficiency. In the end of the cycle, the PDT activity
of BOD1 is inhibited as it is converted into BOD2.

Taking the behavior of BOD1 into account, this PS
can also be considered as a self-activity reporter, namely, it reports
its own PDT activity by producing fluorescent output upon singlet
oxygen generation.36−38

Ascorbate, being an important element of cellular
redox metabolism,
enables communication of the PS with the cell and enables autoinhibition
of the PS by reacting with the cytotoxic 1O2. Since inactivation is dependent on the PDT activity of the PS,
the inhibitory effect of ascorbate is also highly dependent on the
therapeutic activity. In other words, when 1O2 is produced to activate cell death, an autoinactivation pathway
is initiated in parallel (Figure 6).

Even though PDT activity is controlled in
many different ways,
to the best of our knowledge, no one has yet reported PS activity
regulation by such a feedback loop.16−22,39 This behavior can be used in
actual applications such that, once a certain amount of 1O2 is generated sufficiently to kill cancer cells, PS
activity can be self-inhibited to diminish any further effect on neighboring
healthy cells. This would improve the noninvasiveness of PDT. Activity-dependent
inactivation, like we present here, would be a strategy to enable
communication with the stage of therapy. With similar self-inhibitory
PSs having reversible conversion between active/inactive states, an
oscillatory activity can, in principle, be obtained. This behavior
may find application in certain therapies, i.e., those requiring periodic
drug release. This work may encourage the research in such directions.

Experimental
Section
General Methods
All reagents and solvents were purchased
from commercial sources and used without further purification. Compounds BOD1 and BOD2 were prepared using the literature
procedures.24,27 Column chromatography was carried
out using a silica stationary phase (230–400 mesh, SiliCycle
Inc., Canada). Analytical thin layer chromatography was performed
on 0.25 mm thick precoated silica gel plates (60F254, Merck, Germany).
Compounds were visualized under UV light. All 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on a Varian Inova instrument (400 MHz) at Selçuk
University, Konya. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts
per million (ppm) and referenced to the residual solvent peak. Coupling
constants (J) are reported in hertz (Hz). Standard
abbreviations indicating multiplicities are given: br = broad, d =
doublet, m = multiplet, s = singlet, and t = triplet. High-resolution
mass spectrometry was carried out using an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass
Q-TOF LC/MS of the Eastern Anatolia Advanced Technology Research and
Application Centre (DAYTAM, Erzurum, Turkey). For PDT, an LED from
Bright LED Electronics Corp., model BL-BG43V4V, with peak absorption
value at 506 nm was used as a light source. For cell culture experiments
DLD-1 human colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC) were used.

Singlet
Oxygen Generation Experiments
Singlet Oxygen
generations were analyzed using the singlet oxygen trap molecule,
1,3-diphenylisobenzofurane. Absorption of this molecule decreased
upon reaction with 1O2. Typically, 50 μM
of this compound in isopropanol was used in the presence of the photosensitizer
(1, 5, or 10 μM of BOD1 or BOD2).
The absorption spectrum was recorded in the dark (for either 15 or
30 min). Then, samples were irradiated with a 506 nm LED lamp (Bright
LED Electronics Corp., model BL-BG43V4V) from a distance of 20 cm.
For samples that involve sodium ascorbate, a stock solution of this
compound was prepared and added to the reaction cuvette so that the
final ascorbate concentration was 0.2 or 1 mM.

1H
NMR spectra during PDT action were recorded to determine the generation
of BOD2 in the presence of ascorbate. This experiment
was performed in deuterated dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO-d) instead of isopropanol because of the poor solubilities of ascorbate
and photosensitizers in isopropanol at high concentrations. A saturated
solution of sodium ascorbate (having concentration less than 100 mM)
in DMSO-d was prepared. BOD1 (25 mM)
in the presence of saturated sodium ascorbate (less than 100 mM) was
irradiated for 80 min with the 506 nm LED lamp. After the experiment,
the sample was extracted with water and dichloromethane. The organic
phase was collected and dried over sodium sulfate. The 1H NMR spectrum of the organic phase contained peaks corresponding
to only BOD2 (Figure S4).

To show that hydrogen peroxide was involved in the reaction series
leading to BOD2 formation, an experiment involving a
hydrogen peroxide scavenger was designed. Sodium pyruvate (NaPyr)
was used as the scavenger.32BOD1 (25 mM) in the presence of saturated sodium ascorbate and sodium
pyruvate (each less than 100 mM) was irradiated for 80 min with the
506 nm LED lamp and 1H NMR was recorded. The presence of
NaPyr inhibited the formation of BOD2 (Figure S6).

UV–Vis Absorption, Fluorescence Experiments,
and Quantum
Yield Calculations
UV–vis absorption spectra of 10
μM BOD1 in the presence of ascorbate (0.2 mM) in
isopropanol were recorded using a Cary-60 UV-Vis Spectrometer. Samples
were irradiated with the 506 nm LED lamp from 20 cm for 140 min until
no further shift in the spectrum was observed.

Fluorescence
spectra were recorded using an Agilent, Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrometer with a xenon flash lamp. Briefly, 10 μM BOD1 samples in the presence or absence of 0.2 mM sodium ascorbate were
prepared in isopropanol. Samples were irradiated with the 506 nm LED
lamp from 20 cm for 200 min. Fluorescence spectra were recorded in
10 min intervals with excitation at 475 nm.

Quantum yields were
determined using Rhodamine 6G as a reference
fluorophore. Samples were excited at 488 nm. Rhodamine 6G was dissolved
in water, whereas all other samples were dissolved in isopropanol.
Absorbance values of the samples were kept below 0.1, to avoid an
inner filter effect. Calculations were done using the following formula  where QR is the
quantum yield of the reference compound, I and IR are the integrated areas of the emission spectrum
of the sample and reference, respectively, A and AR refer to the absorbance values of the sample
and reference at excitation wavelength (488 nm), respectively, n and nR are the refractive
indices of solvents (1.333 for water and 1.3776 for isopropanol).40

Cell Culture Experiments
DLD-1 human
colorectal adenocarcinoma
cells (ATCC) were cultured in T-75 culture flasks in RPMI 1640 culture
medium at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2 (Binder CB Series CO2 incubators). The standard
RPMI medium was supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% fetal bovine
serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units mL–1 Penicillin G, and 100 μg mL–1 streptomycin
at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. After incubation of the cell line for 24 h, the medium was washed
with PBS buffer, and cell viability was tested for the 0–200
μM concentration range of BOD1 in a 24-well plate
containing 106 cells/well.

To determine cellular
localization, cells were treated with 10 μM H2O2 (to obtain a fluorescence image), then the medium was washed
with PBS buffer. Cells were stained with MitoTracker (ThermoFisher)
and after washing with PBS, 5 μM BOD1 was introduced.41 After incubation with BOD1, cells
were washed with PBS buffer and visualized with a fluorescence microscope
at 20× and 80× (Thermo Muliskan Go).

To determine
cell viability in the dark and after irradiation,
standard Alamar Blue (ThermoFisher) assay was performed. After incubation
of cells, the medium was renewed with 10 μM of either BOD1 or BOD2 and irradiated with the 506 nm LED
array for 2 h. Cell viability was determined using Alamar Blue assay.42

To determine fluorescence enhancement
due to the formation of BOD2, cells were incubated with
10 μM of BOD1 and either irradiated with the 506
nm LED array for 6 h or kept
in the dark (control). Fluorescence of the cells were visualized with
a fluorescence microscope at 20× and 80× (Thermo Muliskan
Go).

Synthesis
Synthesis was performed using modified literature
procedures.24,27

Synthesis of BOD2
Dichloromethane (150
mL) was purged with N2 for 30 min. 4-Pyridinecarboxyaldehyde
(12.7 mmol, 1.36 g, 1.2 mL) was mixed with 2,4-dimethylpyyrole (26.2
mmol, 2.5 g, 2.6 mL) in degased dichloromethane. Three drops of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) were added, and the color of the solution turned red. The
solution was stirred at room temperature for 16 h under an inert atmosphere. p-Chloranil (6.9 mmol, 1.7 g) was added to the solution,
and the solution was stirred for additional 2.5 h, followed by the
addition of triethylamine (7.5 mL) and a boron trifluoride–diethyl
ether complex (7.5 mL). The mixture was stirred for additional 2.5
h at room temperature. The reaction mixture was extracted with water
and dichloromethane. The organic layer was collected, dried with sodium
sulfate, and dichloromethane was evaporated in vacuo. The crude product
was purified by silica gel column chromatography using 5% methanol
in dichloromethane as the eluent. The fraction containing BOD2 was collected, and then the solvent was evaporated under reduced
pressure. The product was obtained as glitter red powder (2.5 mmol,
823 mg, 20%).

1H NMR (400 MHz, chloroform-d) δ 8.78 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, 2H), 7.33
(d, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H), 6.00 (s, 2H), 2.55 (s, 6H),
1.40 (s, 6H). High-resolution ESI-MS values are 326.1640 for theoretical m/z of (M + H)+ and 326.1679
for experimental (Δ: 12 ppm).

Synthesis of BOD1
4-(4,4,5,5,-Tetramethyl-1,3,2-dioxaborolan-2-yl)benzyl
bromide (0.16 mmol, 47 mg) and BOD2 (0.10 mmol, 34 mg)
were dissolved in 10 mL of toluene and then the solution was refluxed
at 90 °C for 16 h. After cooling, the desired product was obtained
by filtering the precipitate. The red–orange solid was further
washed with toluene to afford pure BOD1 (0.05 mmol, 30.8
mg, 49.5%).

1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 9.39 (d, J = 5.9 Hz, 2H),
8.47 (d, J = 6.0 Hz, 2H), 7.72 (d, J = 7.5 Hz, 2H), 7.47 (d, J = 7.4 Hz, 2H), 6.26 (s,
2H), 6.00 (s, 2H), 1.35 (s, 6H), 1.33–1.19 (s, 12H). High-resolution
ESI-MS values are 542.2962 for theoretical m/z of (M)+ and 542.2961 for experimental (Δ:
0.18 ppm).
