Photonic
design and optimization of thin-film polycrystalline diamond
waveguides are shown, serving as advanced evanescent field transducers
in the mid-infrared fingerprint regime (2000–909 cm–1; 5–11 μm). Design constraints inherent to optical/system
considerations and the material were implemented in a finite element
method (FEM)-based simulation method that allowed three-dimensional
modeling of the overall structure. Thus, lateral mode confinement,
attenuation in the direction of radiation propagation, and physical
resilience were evaluated. In a final step, the designed structures
were fabricated, and their utility in combination with a broadly tunable
external cavity quantum cascade laser for chemical sensing of a liquid
phase analyte was demonstrated.

1 Introduction
Diamond is among the most
durable materials available nowadays
applied in a variety of mechanically and chemically demanding application
scenarios. Bulk crystals have been used in long-lasting micromechanical
compartments such as clock gears; as tools such as wear-resistant
sharp scalpels for ocular surgery; as optical components in the X-ray,
visible (vis)-optical, infrared, and THz spectral regime; and for
heat management applications. Furthermore, diamond is being used as
the key material in fusion research, as nuclear radiation detector
or—with NV centers—in quantum physics.1,2 Diamond thin-film coatings have gained increasing interest as ultradurable
and electrically insulating coatings in microchip technology and in
optical compartments deployed in outer space or defense applications.3 In the context of mid-infrared (MIR) sensing,
diamond has matured to be the material of choice in environmentally
demanding sensing scenarios. Materials routinely used as infrared
transparent windows for transmission experiments including calcium
fluoride (CaF2) or zinc selenide (ZnSe) are brittle, prone
to scratching, and resist only a limited set of solvents. Diamond
on the contrary is considered chemically highly inert, and—because
of the hardness—resists physical damage of almost any kind.

Apart from analyzing thin films of liquids, attenuated total reflection
(ATR) techniques allow probing MIR opaque matrices such as aqueous
solutions, as well as gel-like materials and solids including ground
powders, polymers, or bulk material surfaces without requiring additional
sample preparation procedures [i.e., such as pressing into potassium
bromide (KBr) pellets].4,5 Again, commonly applied MIR transparent
ATR crystal materials with high refractive indices such as silicon
(Si), ZnSe, ZnS, chalcogenide glasses, or single-crystalline germanium
(Ge) have to be handled with care. In contrast, ATR waveguides made
from diamond can be utilized in the most demanding circumstances with
limitations only in IR transparency in the spectral region 2200–1800
cm–1 (4.5–5.6 μm) because of two-phonon
crystal lattice absorption features.6 Corrosive
media as well as sharp-edged solids may readily be probed using diamond
ATR crystals.

Specifically, for chemical sensing in the MIR,
the window 1800–600
cm–1 is of interest, constituting the so-called
fingerprint regime, which gives rise to strong fundamental vibrational
modes of inorganic and organic molecules in the condensed phase. In
the gas-phase, roto-vibrational modes may be excited in this spectral
window, as rotational transitions are already excited at lower energies
in the far infrared. ATR spectroscopy is based on the formation of
an evanescent field at the location of internal total reflections
at the crystal/sample interface. Increasing the number of internal
reflections leads to an increased interaction area/volume of the probing
light with the analyte matrix. Besides elongating the waveguide length,
reducing the thickness leads to an increased number of internal reflections.
Ultimately, a uniform evanescent field surrounding the internal reflection
element (IRE) is established once the geometrical dimensions are close
to the supported wavelength with the IRE actually serving as a waveguide.7

Dielectric waveguides have nowadays readily
expanded from the visible
and the near infrared into the MIR. Operation of thin-film waveguides
made from initially bulk materials such as Ge,8−10 Si,11 ZnS,12 ZnSe,13 and chalcogenide glasses,14,15 as well as Si-on-sapphire16 has been
reported in data transfer applications, and chem/biosensing and detection
scenarios. Furthermore, more advanced materials such as gallium arsenide
(GaAs)17,18 and ternary mercury–cadmium–telluride
mixtures (HgCdTe, MCT)19 have been introduced
as versatile thin-film waveguide platforms in MIR evanescent field
chem/biosensors. With increasing availability, diamond has increasingly
emerged as an alternative thin-film MIR waveguide material.20,21 The fundamental utility of thin-film diamond-based transducers for
chemical detection in the MIR has recently been reported.22−24

However, for most materials, there is a gap between their
theoretical
feasibility serving as MIR waveguide and their manufacturability and
tailorability toward selected application scenarios. On the one hand,
optical and geometrical design parameters have to be adjusted, enabling
the desired waveguiding properties, while useful processing schemes
and material availability have to be ensured. Optical properties such
as the refractive index (i.e., real and imaginary parts) of these
materials have to be matched to confine light within the actual waveguiding
photonic structure while minimizing attenuation losses of the transmitted
radiation. Furthermore, adequate fabrication technologies have to
be available for growing and structuring the material of choice. Last
but not least, limiting factors on the choice of materials include
harsh growth or structuring steps during production, whereas, for
example, thermal expansion coefficients and/or chemical interactions
between various material layers (e.g., substrate, adhesion layer,
waveguide layer, etc.) have to be tailored to avoid delamination or
buckling of the actual thin-film waveguide layer. On the other hand,
the final device needs to meet an operational design that allows practical
application for the desired task. Finally, evanescent field sensors
have to provide sufficient structural integrity and robustness during
liquid or solid analyte deposition, cleaning procedures, etc.

In the present study, we show the evaluation and optimization of
polycrystalline diamond (PCD) thin-films grown at Si wafer substrates
with a Si dioxide (SiO2) optical cladding layer via finite
element modeling (FEM). Suitable boundary conditions given by the
material properties and technological availability were explored,
and Si nitride (Si3N4) as an additional cladding
layer was studied. Finally, the experimental application of a thin-film
PCD waveguide manufactured according to the derived design rules in
an evanescent field chem/biosensing scenario was shown in combination
with a broadly tunable external cavity quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL)
light source in the wavelength regime of 2000–909 cm–1 (5–11 μm), as required for analytical applications
in the MIR fingerprint spectral regime.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Growth
The first
step in thin-film
diamond waveguide fabrication is selecting optimized growth conditions.
Besides defining the desired optical parameters, material aspects
of the various layers have to be matched. In particular, lattice mismatch
has to be reduced, and thermal expansion coefficients (Figure 1) have to be selected, reducing
inter- and intralayer stress. Additionally, the selected substrates
have to endure elevated temperatures in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere.
Most commonly used MIR transparent materials such as alkali metal
and silver halides or KRS-5 are susceptible to harsh growth conditions
at temperatures up to 800 °C. Furthermore, the substrate should
form strong carbide bonds for supporting diamond adhesion. Besides
utilizing diamond itself, molybdenum and Ir/YSZ/Si28 have been introduced as suitable substrate materials for
chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond bulk crystals even at single
crystalline quality.29 Si and SiO2 have been successfully implemented as versatile substrates for nano-
and microcrystalline diamond growth. Si crystallizes in a diamond
lattice and in addition generates a strongly bound carbide (SiC).
Furthermore, toxic materials such as lead or cadmium salts, selenides,
and arsenides can be avoided using the Si technology. However, Si
has a refractive index of approx. 3.4 in the MIR, which is higher
than that of diamond (ni = 2.4). Hence,
an adequate cladding layer has to be inserted between the diamond
film and the Si substrate. Commonly, SiO2 is used as it
is readily grown on top of Si via thermal formation or plasma-enhanced
CVD prior to the diamond growth.

used substrate materials

2.2 Structuring
In the literature, it
has been shown for the example of unstructured slab waveguides fabricated
from GaAs/AlGaAs that manual handling is facilitated for chip dimensions
of 10 × 5 mm, while enabling highly sensitive evanescent field
absorption spectroscopy via the vertically stacked waveguide structure.33−35 However, because of the comparably low refractive index of diamond
(2.4) versus GaAs (3.4), IR radiation is more weakly confined within
the diamond structure, and triangular spreading along the propagation
axis is much more pronounced compared to GaAs. As shown in the calculations
visualized in Figure 2, after 1 cm of propagation within the waveguide structure an initial
beam diameter of 6 μm results in a wave front (mode) with a
full width of half-maximum (fwhm) of 1556 μm in diamond, which
is about twice the fwhm in GaAs (i.e., 824 μm). Consequently,
propagation losses are much more pronounced as decoupling via side
facets is possible and collecting emitted radiation at the distal
facet becomes more complex. Horizontal structuring of slab waveguides
into waveguide strips resolves this issue, as additional air cladding
limits horizontal dispersion and an increased amount of radiation
efficiently collected at the outcoupling facet.

Figure 2 (a) Comparison of the
fwhm of wave fronts propagated through slab
waveguides (5 mm wide) and strip waveguides (6 μm wide) made
from diamond and GaAs. The improved lateral wave front confinement
for strip structures (dimensions in μm) is immediately evident.
(b) Scattering within a GaAs slab waveguide. (c) Scattering within
a diamond slab waveguide (dimensions in μm).

As shown in Figure 3, the derived attenuation of the diamond waveguides
is high compared
to the attenuation of, for example, silica fibers (∼0.16 dB/km)36 ranging from approx. 10 to 70 dB/cm. However,
the combination of short transducer dimensions (i.e., 1 cm) and bright
MIR light sources (i.e., QCLs) with peak emission powers of up to
500 mW enables transmission characteristics through these photonic
structures suitable for chem/biosensing applications. Relatively weak
attenuation between 1666 and 1429 cm–1 (6 and 7
μm) renders these waveguides suitable for the investigation
of, for example, proteins, as amide I and II bands are present within
this spectral window.22,37 Toward shorter wavelengths, the
attenuation is apparently increased because of the two-phonon crystal
lattice absorption feature inherent to diamond.6 Toward longer wavelengths, differences in attenuation intensity
are evident for different cladding layouts.

Figure 3 (a) Electric field (V/m)
within a 1 cm long diamond waveguide (6
× 6 μm) at a wavelength of 6 μm. (b) Electric field
(V/m) in a 1 cm long diamond waveguide (6 × 6 μm) at a
wavelength of 8 μm. (c) Comparison of the calculated attenuation
for different waveguide structures. Free-standing diamond waveguides
show reduced attenuation toward longer wavelengths (dark and light
blue). Waveguides deposited onto a SiO2 cladding layer
(red and yellow) show increased attenuation toward the SiO2 absorption feature. An additional Si3N4 cladding
increases the accessible spectral window toward longer wavelengths
(purple). (d) Calculated penetration depth of the evanescent field
emanating from a 6 μm thick diamond waveguide into a 2 μm
thick SiO2 cladding layer for the exemplary wavelengths
of 6 and 8 μm.

Considering a theoretical free-standing diamond strip, the
attenuation
decreases continuously, as no inherent diamond absorption features
are apparent toward the longer wavelength regime. For a 6 μm
thick waveguide supported by a solid cladding bottom layer made from
SiO2, the attenuation steeply increases at wavelengths
>7 μm. This results from the pronounced absorption feature
of
the cladding layer made from SiO2, which is centered at
approx. 9.3 μm (∼1100 cm–1) with an
absorption shoulder at 8.4 μm (∼1190 cm–1).

Waveguides with a thickness of 10 μm are affected
by the
same cladding absorption features. However, attenuation at 8 μm
is only about 1/3 of the attenuation of the 6 μm thick waveguides,
which is due to the decreased interaction of the propagated electric
field with the cladding layer because of the confinement in a geometrically
more spacious structure. Further opening of the spectral transparency
window may be achieved by the addition of a Si3N4 film in between the SiO2 and the diamond layer. Si3N4 has a pronounced infrared absorption feature
at approx. 11.5 μm (870 cm–1) with a small
shoulder at approx. 8 μm (1250 cm–1). As a
consequence, the transmission window should extend up to wavelengths
of 9 μm before increasing attenuation losses prohibit further
transmission. The thickness of the Si3N4 layer
was selected at 200 nm, as such thin films can be deposited largely
defect-free, and the evanescent field intensity drops relatively rapidly
within the cladding layer. As shown in Figure 3d for exemplary wavelengths of 1666 and 1250
cm–1 (6 and 8 μm), the evanescent field already
drops to a value of 1/e after approx. 1 μm
within the SiO2 cladding layer. Hence, the interaction
with the stronger absorbing n-doped Si substrate is effectively avoided.
Consequently, already a thin intermediate layer between diamond and
SiO2 effectively reduces the interaction and improves the
waveguiding properties.

As a tradeoff between structural support
and ideal waveguiding
properties, free-standing diamond waveguides supported by a frame-shaped
substrate may be envisioned. Interaction with the strongly absorbing
cladding layers can be reduced by reducing the thickness of that layer
in a subsequent processing step after the growth. However, the structural
support is likewise reduced, and the utility as an evanescent field
transducer element may be limited.

Within the predefined set
of suitable designs for optimized waveguiding
properties, the requirements for chem/biosensing applications in terms
of transducer robustness cannot be neglected. Our calculations show
that free-standing single mode waveguides with the required dimensions
(6 × 6 or 10 × 10 μm) are not sufficiently robust
to withstand the addition of even a single water droplet with a volume
of 50 μL. However, increasing the waveguide thickness to, for
example, 14 μm or using a slab with, for example, 100 μm
results in robust optical transducer elements, as shown in Figure 4. If the physical
stress exceeds approx. 300 MPa for reduced waveguide dimensions (marked
with the red line), free-standing waveguide structures are likely
to break.

Figure 4 (a) Structural stress on a 14 × 100 μm free-standing
diamond waveguide with the addition of one droplet of water at the
surface (dimensions in μm). (b) Summary of the structural stress
for different waveguide widths with 6 and 14 μm thickness. The
red line represents the maximum stress level, which these diamond
strips are most likely to withstand. Smaller geometric dimensions
(i.e., area above the red line) will result in higher stress levels,
and the waveguides will break according to literature values.38

However, further variations of the frame design are possible
such
as adding a third frame leg to support the waveguides or varying the
length of the waveguides and correspondingly, the free-standing segment.

Yet, more advanced designs can be considered given the boundary
conditions of photonic properties and structural integrity in chem/biosensing
applications. Instead of removing the supporting substrate structure
completely or reducing to a frame, slots in the substrate leaving
diamond membranes may be conceived. With this concept, the interfering
oxide cladding can be entirely removed at the backside of the waveguide
to establish an air cladding similar to free-standing waveguides,
yet only in the actual waveguiding areas.

Introducing rib waveguides
is a logical consequence to confine
light within predefined areas, while maintaining lateral structural
support. The design layout presented in Figure 8 may thus be modified by adding an additional
diamond slab adjacent to the initial waveguide. An exemplary permutation
of potential rib designs is shown in Figure 5 for a wavelength
(λ) of 6 μm altering the waveguide width (w), the slab height (r), and the waveguide height
(h). The corresponding simulations show that no waveguiding
is possible for h < 4 μm, w < 4 μm, and r < 4 μm. Slab modes
are enabled though for r > 3 μm, which has
to be avoided because the waveguiding properties, that is lateral
confinement, is lost, and the waveguide would only serve as a slab
structure. On the other hand, r should not be too
small, as the structural robustness may increasingly be affected using
thinner slab membranes. An ultimate slab height of 0 would then essentially
correspond to a strip waveguide. Multiple modes appear for w > 10 μm, h > 6 μm,
and r < 3 μm. Multimode waveguiding maintains
the waveguiding
properties of the transducer, however, at increased losses and with
lower sensitivity affecting the overall sensor performance.39 Calculations reveal that the targeted single-mode
range is achieved at geometrical properties that are close to a fitted
surface following eq 1. 1

the loss of lateral mode confinement.

2.3 Experimental Verification of the Derived Waveguide
Design Rules
Transmission spectra of slab waveguides at different
optimization steps reveal that the properties predicted from the theoretical
calculations are indeed correct. A simple diamond slab waveguide deposited
onto a SiO2 cladding layer shows poor transmission within
the MIR fingerprint window ranging from 2000 to 909 cm–1 (5–11 μm). Transmission is reduced by the two-phonon
absorption in diamond toward the short wavelength range, as anticipated.
Toward the longer wavelength regime, transmission is limited by the
SiO2 absorption. Focused ion beam (FIB) polishing of the
waveguide edges results in a minor improvement of the transmitted
light intensity. As suggested from the calculations, only removing
the Si substrate does not result in a significant improvement of the
transmission performance. This further confirms that a 2 μm
cladding layer is sufficient to suppress coupling of radiation into
the substrate.

Significant improvement of the transmission properties
by a factor of approx. 6 is achieved, if the SiO2 cladding
layer is removed from the backside as well, and an air cladding is
introduced (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Experimental evaluation of the transmission behavior of diamond
waveguides deposited onto a SiO2 cladding at different
stages of the manufacturing process. Untreated (red line), FIB polished
(blue line), and waveguides with the Si substrate removed from the
backside (yellow line) show poor transmission in the MIR fingerprint
regime, whereas partly removing the SiO2 cladding results
in improved transmission. However, inherent diamond absorptions toward
2000 cm–1 (5 μm) and SiO2 absorptions
toward 1100 cm–1 (9 μm) remain clearly limiting.

Furthermore, the performance of
a 500 μm wide and 14 μm
thick free-standing PCD waveguide has been evaluated. The waveguide
is supported by a Si frame with a contact length of approx. 4 mm2. The cladding consisted of 2 μm SiO2 and
200 nm of Si3N3 in between the Si substrate
and the diamond waveguide layer. The SiO2 cladding layer
was removed from the free-standing areas of the waveguide. Again,
the obtained spectra show little transmission toward the two-phonon
absorption feature around 2000 cm–1 (5 μm)
and toward the SiO2 absorption feature around 1100 cm–1 (9 μm) (Figure 7).

microscope image of the free-standing in-coupling facet of the PCD

To evaluate the fundamental suitability for chem/bioevanescent
field sensing applications, exemplarily a 50 μL water droplet
was deposited at the waveguide surface, and the background spectrum
(I0) was recorded. Subsequently, defined
volumes of N-N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) in water were added as droplets to the waveguide surface, and
sample spectra (I) were recorded. The final absorbance
spectra (A) were calculated according to A = −log(I/I0). Using the 3σ noise criterion, a limit of detection
of approx. 5 vol % was derived. Further noise reduction can be achieved
by averaging an increased number of scans or applying smoothing algorithms
to improve the limits of detection during future experiments.

3 Conclusions
Fundamental design considerations for the
implementation of PCD
waveguides serving as MIR evanescent field transducers in chem/biosensing
applications have been theoretically modeled and experimentally verified
in this study. Boundary conditions derived from the material properties
including potential decomposition under harsh manufacturing and experimental
conditions or matching refractive indices required for establishing
dielectric waveguides have been examined. FEM-based calculations have
been confirmed as a versatile tool for the optimization of optical
design parameters, while taking material properties as constraints
into account. The resulting photonic design considerations have been
aligned with mechanical demands in chem/biosensing scenarios, enabling
the integration of PCD photonic structures into practically useful
optical sensor devices. The addition of an additional intermediate
Si3N4 cladding layer has been found to be beneficial
to expand the accessible spectral window further into the long wavelength
region. Further optimization of the respective cladding materials
may lead to additional improvements of the waveguiding properties
of the presented waveguide platform because of lower losses and a
broader accessible spectral window.

Finally, the designed waveguide
structures were actually fabricated
and their function as transducer in chem/biosensors experimentally
verified. For that purpose, thin-film PCD waveguides were combined
with EC-QCLs for the analysis of liquid phase samples. The spectral
behavior and limitations predicted by the preceding calculations have
thereby been experimentally confirmed. Hence, the design rules derived
in the present study may be adapted to other waveguide material systems
during future investigations.

Last but not least, more sophisticated
waveguide geometries including
ring/disk/racetrack resonators or optical couplers may be implemented
in the same model toward further enhancing the sensitivity of on-chip
MIR photonics.

4 Methods
4.1 Modeling
of the Optical Properties
Optimization of the waveguide properties
has been performed via the
frequency domain module for two-dimensional modeling and with the
beam envelope method for three-dimensional modeling, with both included
in the electromagnetic waves modules of the COMSOL Multiphysics software
package (version 5.2a, COMSOL Multiphysics GmbH). Diamond waveguides
on SiO2 on an optional Si3N4 cladding
layer and on a heavily n-doped Si substrate with an upper air cladding
for a total waveguide length of 1 cm were modeled using the material
properties summarized in Table 1 and the geometric design parameters illustrated in Figure 8.

Figure 8 Geometric dimensions of the modeled diamond waveguides deposited
onto a SiO2 cladding layer and onto a heavily n-doped Si
substrate. Optionally, a second cladding layer (Si3N4) was introduced in between the diamond and the SiO2 layer or a diamond slab was added alongside the diamond strip. For
modeling free-standing waveguide structures, the properties of the
SiO2 and the Si layers were set equal to those of the air
cladding.

4.2 Modeling of the Mechanical Properties
The COMSOL Multiphysics
structural mechanics module has been used
to derive structural stress of free-standing waveguides of 1 cm length
at a variable width of 20, 100, 200, 350, and 500 μm and at
a thickness of 6 and 14 μm. Structural support was modeled via
a 2 mm wide frame recessed by 1 mm from each end facet. The resulting
bending forces were derived from the applied weight of a 50 μL
water droplet inducing a downward-directed force of 0.491 mN. For
the calculations, a diamond density of 3515 kg/m3, Young’s
modulus of 1050 GPa, and Poisson’s ratio of 0.1 were used (Table 2).25

4.3 Fabrication
of Diamond Waveguide Structures
for Application in MIR Sensing
Thin diamond films were purchased
from Diamond Materials GmbH (Freiburg, Germany). As a substrate, highly
n-doped Si wafers were used. The doping level ensures that the Si
substrate is opaque in the MIR because of strong free-carrier absorption.
The Si bulk wafer prevented potential bending or buckling of the entire
structure because of high layer strains, which may arise during the
diamond growth process. On top of the Si substrate, a 2 μm SiO2 cladding layer was thermally grown. Optionally, another 200
nm of Si3N4 was deposited on top of the SiO2 layer. Then, thin-film PCD of optical grade was grown at
various thicknesses via CVD. After successful growth, the Si substrate
was polished from the backside until the Si layer was thinned to approx.
500 μm. Afterward, the diamond layer was polished to obtain
a smooth surface (arithmetic average roughness Ra < 10 nm), and the wafer was diced into 1 × 1 cm segments.
The diced chips were used for structuring free-standing waveguides.
For slab waveguides, the dices were further cleaved into 5 ×
10 mm segments in an optional next step. Afterward, the diamond layer
was structured via a dry etching protocol based on Ar/O2.44−46 Next, the chips were flipped by 180°, and the backside Si material
was removed via etching using a standard Bosch process for establishing
slots, frames, or membranes.24 In a last
step, the chips were dipped into a buffered hydrogen fluoride solution
to remove residual SiO2 at exposed areas. Thus prepared
diamond waveguides were further optimized via water-vapor-assisted
FIB milling for obtaining smooth in- and out-coupling facets. Rayleigh
scattering at nanoscale grain boundaries is negligible within the
waveguide structure. However, end facets may be significantly rougher,
giving rise to substantial in- and out-coupling losses by scattering
(Figure 9).

facet before FIB polishing and (b) PCD end facet after
water vapor-assisted FIB milling.

4.4 Experimental Setup
The experimental
setup used for the evaluation of the PCD waveguides as the IR transducer
was based on a broadly tunable EC-QCL system (MIRcat, Daylight Solutions,
San Diego, CA, USA). This system comprises four individual QCLs optically
coupled into one collimated output beam. The laser system covers a
spectral range of 2020–890 cm–1 (4.95–11.24
μm) and provides approx. 500 mW of peak output power at the
center wavelength of each parabolic emission curve of any particular
laser chip. The laser was operated in the pulsed mode with a pulse
width of 400 ns and at a repetition rate of 100 kHz. The laser head
was thermoelectrically cooled (TEC) to 17 °C. The laser head
emitted 100:1 vertically polarized radiation within a collimated beam,
which was focused via a ZnSe lens (focal length 25 mm) onto the end
facet of the PCD waveguide. Radiation at the distal end of the waveguide
was collected via a second ZnSe lens (focal length, 25 mm) and subsequently
focused on a detector using a third ZnSe lens (focal length, 12.7
mm). Additional apertures between the laser and the first lens, and
between the second and third lens, allowed further beam shaping and
intensity control (Figure 10). The detector (PVMI-4TE 12 PIP-PC 200-M-F-M4, Vigo System
S.A., Ozarow Mazowiecki, Poland) was based on a TEC MCT chip optically
immersed into a GaAs hypersphere, which was optimized for detection
at a wavelength of 10.6 μm. Data acquisition was performed via
a National Instruments PC oscilloscope (NI PXIe-5114 125 MHz, 250
MS/s, 8-bit), which was operated using a LabVIEW (LabVIEW 2016) script.
The script was based on tuning the QCL emission wavelength at 1 cm–1 increments.

Figure 10 Schematic of the experimental setup comprising
an EC-QCL, a TEC-cooled
MCT detector, beam shaping apertures, and three ZnSe lenses (L1, L2,
L3) along with electronics for system control and data acquisition.
The actual PCD waveguide sample is located between L1 and L2 and was
adjustable within the beam path in the x,y,z-position.
