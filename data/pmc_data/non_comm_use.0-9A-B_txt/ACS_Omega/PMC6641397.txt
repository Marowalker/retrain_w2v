Heat
shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitors play a remarkable role
in cellular growth, and they were shown to exhibit antitumor activity.
The Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 (onalespib) is under clinical trials for
the treatment of refractory gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Recently,
it was demonstrated that this compound also exhibits inhibition against
bladder cancer. Here, we report isoindoline- and isoindolinone-based
(halomethyl)benzenes via a [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization in the presence
of catalytic amounts of Mo(CO)6. This strategy has been
extended to synthesize the key precursor of the Hsp90 inhibitor, AT13387.

==== Body
Introduction
Several medicinally
important and pharmaceutically active compounds
consist of diverse heterocycles, and they are critical components
in various biological processes. A great deal of new scientific insight
has been acquired because of the availability of novel heterocyclic
compounds.1 Therefore, there is always
a pressing need for the development of simple and efficient synthetic
methods to heterocycles. Figure 1 shows some of the natural products containing isoindoline1a and isoindolinone1b motifs in their structures. The isoindoline derivative, heat shock
protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, AT13387 (1) is currently
in clinical trials for the treatment of refractory gastrointestinal
stromal tumors.2 Lenalidomide (2) is a modified phthalimide core used as an anticancer drug against
multiple myeloma, approved by FDA in 2004.3 Lactonamycin (3) shows antimicrobial activity against
Gram-positive bacteria. Matsumoto and co-workers isolated this compound
from a culture broth of Streptomyces rishiriensis MJ773-88K4 in 1996.4a In 2010, Tatsuta
group has reported the first total synthesis of lactonamycin, where
they used a sequential intramolecular conjugate addition of alcohols
to the acetylenic ester and stereoselective glycosylation of the tertiary
alcohol and Michael–Dieckmann-type cyclization as key steps.4b Stachflin (4),5 stachybotrylactam (5),6 memnobotrin A (6),7 erinacerin
A (7),8 and hericinone B (8)9 are meroterpenoids, and chilenine
(9)10 is an alkaloid containing
an isoindolinone unit.

core
units.

Transition-metal-catalyzed [2
+ 2 + 2] cycloaddition11 is a useful tool
to prepare heterocycles involving
efficient atom-economic routes. These cycloaddition processes enable
the formation of several C–C bonds in a single step, and moreover,
a large number of functional groups are tolerated. However, many transition-metal
complexes do not tolerate the presence of benzyl halides, as they
involve in oxidation insertion and thus decompose; hence, the use
of propargyl halides as copartners in [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions
is not a trivial exercise.

Even though, many transition-metal
complexes are known to perform
[2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions, very few reports are available
with molybdenum-catalyzed cyclotrimerizations in the literature. Mo(CO)6 is a well-known catalyst for alkyne metathesis12a since its discovery by Mortreux and Blanchard
in 1974,12b but it is rarely used for [2
+ 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions. In 1995, Mori et al. reported molybdenum-catalyzed
alkyne metathesis of alkynes containing hydroxyphenyl groups, where
they observed that the monoalkynes containing an o-hydroxyphenyl group gave trimerized products.12c Since then only very few reports are available using molybdenum-based
catalysts in [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions.13

In view of our interest to design polycycles by a
[2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization
of 1,6-diynes with propargyl halides, we envisioned a simple synthetic
route to heterocyclic (halomethyl)benzene derivatives in the presence
of catalytic amounts of Mo(CO)6.13g These compounds are difficult to assemble without the involvement
of benzyl alcohol derivatives. It is worth mentioning that the conversation
of benzyl alcohols to the corresponding bromides (or chlorides) requires
the usage of HBr (or HCl) or HBr (or HCl) surrogates, and these conditions
are incompatible with sensitive functional groups. Here, we chose
N-protected dipropargylamine as the diyne partner. There are many
reports available where [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reactions involving
dipropargylamines are trimerized with a variety of alkyne partners
to create isoindoline derivatives. However, no reports are available
where dipropargylamines undergo trimerization with propargyl halides
via a [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition route to deliver heterocyclic targets.
This approach to generate (halomethyl)benzene derivatives directly
via a [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction is not a trivial exercise
because many transition metals react with benzyl halides. More interestingly,
realization of this methodology allows the preparation of (halomethyl)benzene
derivatives of several sensitive substrates (e.g., Meldrum’s
acid, peptides, etc.) which are otherwise difficult to prepare by
conventional routes.

Results and Discussion
To test the
[2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization methodology, we selected N-tosylamide 10, a cheaper and commercially
available starting material to produce the key building block 12, which on treatment with propargyl bromide in the presence
of Cs2CO3 gave the diyne 12.14 Later, treatment of the diyne 12 with different propargyl halides (11a–d) under
microwave irradiation (MWI) conditions in the presence of catalytic
amounts of Mo(CO)6 in acetonitrile produced the corresponding
(halomethyl)benzenes (13a–d) in good yields (Scheme 1). However, in the
absence of Mo(CO)6, the reaction did not proceed and the
starting material was recovered. Under conventional heating conditions,
using propargyl bromide and Mo(CO)6 in acetonitrile, the
reaction took longer time and the yield was much less.

Scheme 1 [2 + 2
+ 2] Cyclotrimerization of N-Tosyl-N,N-dipropargylamine 12
Because several natural products contain the
isoindolinone moiety
as a core unit in their structures (e.g., 2–9 in Figure 1), we chose compound 17 as a diyne partner. To prepare this key building block, N-methylamine (14) was treated with methyl
propiolate (15) at 0 °C to form N-methyl propiolamide (16), which on further treatment
with propargyl bromide (11a) under NaH/tetrahydrofuran
(THF) conditions gave the diyne building block 17 (Scheme 2).15

Scheme 2 Synthesis of Diyne Derivative 17
Next, dipropargyl compound 17 was treated with propargyl
halides (11a–d) in the presence of Mo(CO)6 under MWI conditions to deliver the (halomethyl)benzene derivatives 18a–d (Scheme 3). Propargyl halide 11a (or 11c)
on treatment with unsymmetrical diyne 17 gave 18a (or 18c) as a mixture of inseparable regioisomers (1:1
ratio based on NMR spectra) by column chromatography.

Halides (11a–d)
Hsp90 is a protein chaperone which controls the cell survival,
proliferation, apoptosis, and so forth. It controls many physiological
processes such as signal transduction, intracellular transport, and
protein degradation. As Hsp90 controls the cellular growth by blocking
multiple signaling pathways simultaneously, Hsp90 inhibitors are playing
an important role in antitumor activity.16 In 2017, Li and co-workers demonstrated the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors
against bladder cancer also.16e To this
end, we identified the AT13387 (onalespib) Hsp90 inhibitor as a worthwhile
target to test our methodology. In 2012, Barrett group has reported
the total synthesis of AT13387 using a novel biomimetic aromatization
and Suzuki–Miyaura cross-coupling reaction as key steps.2c Later, in 2014, Liang et al. reported the synthesis
of isoindoline derivatives via a [2 + 2 + 2] cycloaddition reaction
followed by oxidation and reductive amination with N-methylpiperazine.2d

We realized
that the [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization strategy with
the propargyl bromide as a cyclotrimerization partner can deliver
the bromo derivative 22 directly in a single operation.
Therefore, the required diyne 21 was prepared by NH protection
of propargylamine (19) with (Boc)2O, followed
by propargylation in the presence of propargyl bromide and NaH, as
reported in the literature.2d Later, the
diyne 21 was treated with propargyl bromide (11a) in the presence of catalytic amounts of Mo(CO)6 under
MWI conditions for 15 min to deliver the desired product 22 in 55% yield. Further, it was reacted with N-methylpiperazine
(23) under K2CO3/acetonitrile conditions
at room temperature (rt) for 4 h to produce the N-Boc-piperazinoisoindoline 24 (99%, Scheme 4) whose 1H and 13C NMR spectral data were found to be the same as reported
in the literature.2c Our approach to 24 constitutes redox economy where oxidation and reduction
steps are eliminated.

via [2 + 2 + 2] Cycloaddition
Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated [2 + 2
+ 2] cyclotrimerization
sequence with propargyl halides to synthesize (halomethyl)benzene
derivatives containing isoindoline and isoindolinone moieties in moderate
to good yields. In addition, we synthesized the key precursor of isoindoline
derivative 24 of AT13387 involving step economy and redox
economy and thus achieved a great deal of synthetic economy.17 Because the intermediate 24 has
already been converted into AT13387 previously,2c our synthesis of 24 constitutes a formal total
synthesis of AT13387.

Experimental Section
All reactions
were performed under an argon or nitrogen atmosphere
using a well-dried reaction flask. All commercial products were used
as received without further purification. All solvents used as reaction
media were dried over predried molecular sieves (4 Å) in an oven.
Column chromatography was performed with silica gel (100–200
mesh) using a mixture of petroleum ether and EtOAc as an eluent. 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data were recorded on
400 and 100 MHz or 500 and 125 MHz spectrometers using tetramethylsilane
as an internal standard and chloroform-d as a solvent.
High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) was performed using a Bruker
(Maxis Impact) or Micromass Q-ToF spectrometer. The microwave reactor
used was Discover SP by CEM Corporation, and all microwave reactions
were performed under the standard method, where time and temperature
can be monitored manually.

Synthesis of Diyne 12(14)
To the suspension of 4-methylbenzenesulfonamide
(10) (2.00 g, 11.7 mmol) in acetone, cesium carbonate
(11.4
g, 35 mmol) was added and stirred for 15–20 min at room temperature.
To this, propargyl bromide (11a) (4.16 g, 35 mmol) was
added, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 16 h. The
solvent was removed in vacuo. The residual solid was dissolved in
water, and DCM was added. The layers were separated, and the aqueous
layer was extracted with DCM. The combined organic layers were dried
over sodium sulfate and filtered. Evaporation of the solvent delivered
the crude product, which was purified by silica gel column chromatography
(petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 5:1) to obtain diyne 12 (2.8 g, 97%) as a colorless solid.

Synthesis of Compound 16(15a)
To a solution of
methylamine (14) (2.0 g,
64.5 mmol) in 5 mL of water, methyl propiolate (15) (6.0
g, 71.0 mmol) was added dropwise at 0 °C for 30 min. The mixture
was stirred for 2 h at 0 °C, and then few drops of acetic acid
were added. The mixture was stirred for another 10 min and saturated
with NaCl, followed by extraction with ethyl acetate (3 × 10
mL). The combined organic phase was washed with saturated aqueous
solution of NaHCO3, dried over Na2SO4, and removed by rotary evaporation to give product 16 (3.5 g), which was used for the next step without any further purification.

Synthesis of Diyne 17(15)
To a suspension of NaH (1.13 g, 47 mmol) in dry THF, compound 16 (3.0 g, 36.14 mmol) was added dropwise and stirred for
15–20 min at 0 °C. Next, propargyl bromide (11a) (6.45 g, 54.21 mmol) was added, and the mixture was stirred for
3 h at 0 °C. Water was added to the reaction mixture, followed
by extraction with ethyl acetate (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic
layers were dried over sodium sulfate and filtered. Evaporation of
the solvent delivered the crude product, which was purified by silica
gel column chromatography (petroleum ether/ethyl acetate 5:1) to obtain
diyne 17 (2.6 g, 60%) as a pale yellow oil.

Synthesis of N-Boc-propargylamine (20)2d
To a stirred solution of
propargylamine (19) (100 mg, 3.63 mmol) in THF was added
di-tert-butyl dicarbonate (436.5 mg, 2.0 mmol) at
rt. The solution was stirred at the same temperature for 4 h and then
concentrated in vacuo. The resulting residue was dissolved in EtOAc,
washed with water and brine, and then dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. After removal of the solvent in vacuo, N-Boc-propargylamine (20) (253.64 mg, 90%)
was obtained as a yellow solid, which was pure enough and used for
the next step without further purification.

Synthesis of N-Boc-dipropargylamine (21)2d
To a stirred solution
of N-Boc-propargylamine (20) (200 mg,
1.29 mmol) in anhydrous THF (70 mL) was added 60% NaH (43.35 mg, 1.8
mmol). The suspension was stirred for 0.5 h, and then propargyl bromide
(11a) (245.67 mg, 2.06 mmol) was added dropwise. The
mixture was stirred at rt for 8 h and then quenched with saturated
NH4Cl solution. The resulting mixture was extracted with
EtOAc (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic phases were then washed
with water and brine and dried over Na2SO4.
After the solvent was removed in vacuo, the crude product was subjected
to flash column chromatography (eluting with petroleum ether/EtOAc
= 120:1) to give 21 as a pale yellow oil (186.77 mg,
75%).

General Procedure for [2 + 2 + 2] Cycloaddition under MWI Conditions
To a solution of diyne (50 mg) and propargyl halide (2 equiv) in
dry acetonitrile (5 mL), Mo(CO)6 (5 mol %) was added and
the reaction mixture was stirred under MWI conditions for 15 min.
After the completion of reaction [thin-layer chromatography (TLC)
monitoring], the solvent was concentrated at reduced pressure and
the crude product was purified by silica gel column chromatography
using ethyl acetate/petroleum ether (10:90) to give the cyclotrimerized
product.

To the compound 22 in dry MeCN, K2CO3 and N-methylpiperazine 23 were added at rt and continuously
stirred for 4 h. After completion
of the reaction (TLC monitoring), the reaction mass was quenched with
water and extracted with EtOAc. All combined organic layers were washed
with brine, dried over Na2SO4, and concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product was found to be pure by
NMR; hence, it can be used for the next step as it is. Yield = 99%,
light brown sticky liquid, 1H NMR (500 MHz, CDCl3): δ 1.50 (s, 9H), 2.28 (d, J = 0.08 Hz, 3H),
