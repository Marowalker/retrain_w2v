Fused
nitrogen heterocyclesnamely, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones have been obtained by
exploiting the 1,3-dipolar nature of N-arylsydnones,
from hydrazones of 3-aryl-4-acetylsydnones via the
Vilsmeier–Haack strategy. Facile intramolecular nucleophilic
addition followed by CO2 elimination under reflux or upon
microwave irradiation was presented. Plausible mechanisms for the
formation of the title compounds are proffered. Structure confirmatory

Introduction
Mesoionic compounds
are the five-membered heterocycles that cannot
be represented by either a polar or covalent structure. Sydnones are
the class of compounds that are mesoionic comprising nitrogen and
oxygen atoms in the ring.1−3 These are used as useful synthons
in various reactions, particularly in 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition to
yield a variety of nitrogen heterocycles. Huisgen and co-workers in
1962 reported a pioneering work of formation of pyrazoles by thermal
1,3-dipolar cycloaddition between sydnones as dipoles and alkynes
as dipolarophiles. These may be considered as 1,3-dipoles that upon
photolysis, yield nitrile imine intermediates or in the thermal reactions,
act as cyclic azomethine imines. With acetylenic dipolarophiles, they
undergo such cycloaddition reaction under thermal4,5 or
photochemical conditions6−8 to yield pyrazole and/or pyrazolines.
3,4-Disubstituted sydnones upon photochemical reaction yield fused
pyrazole derivatives.9 Sydnone can also
undergo transformations and delivers pyrazole via a [4 + 2] cycloaddition–retrocycloaddition
with the expulsion of carbon dioxide. Nonsymmetrical alkynes resulted
in the formation of two pyrazole products, with less or negligible
regioselectivity.10 A proper insight about
the reactivity and recent advances of the popular mesoionic compound,
namely, N-arylsydnone, has been extensively reviewed.
Two recent reviews discuss the strategies involved in the sydnone–alkyne
cycloaddition12 and also their synthetic
applications.13

More than a century
has passed since α-diazo
derivatives of pyrazole have been discovered, but the five-membered
heterocycle, pyrazole, has continued to be a star molecule because
of its great interest in various fields.14 Pyrazole and their derivatives possess a wide range of bioactivities.15−21 Pyridazine and their analogues were thought worthwhile to study
because they are available as a number of marketed drugs such as Hydralazine,22 Minaprine,23 and
Cefozopran.24 It has also been reported
that pyridazine derivatives display anticancer,25 anti-HIV,26 antihypertensive,27 antimicrobial, and antifungal activities.28−30

Scheme 1 Tautomeric Structures of Pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazine
The combination of two pharmacophores into a single molecule
is
an established methodology for obtaining a potent molecule. Consequently,
a design of efficient methods for the assembly of these fused nitrogen
heterocycles is of considerable interest, and many such approaches
have been discussed in the literature. A useful method for the preparation
of pyrazole and pyrazolopyridazine derivatives is the nucleophilic
addition of hydrazines to 4-acyl-furandiones in boiling benzene.31 Pyrazolopyridazine/ones have been obtained by
various methods, that is, (i) pyrazole-3-carboxylic acid with 2,5-dichlorophenylhydrazine
(4),32 (ii) 1-phenyl-4-(2-thienylcarbonyl)-pyrazole-3-carboxylate
(5),33 and (iii) 4-benzoyl-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-2,3-furandione
(6)34 (Scheme 2). Three position isomers have been reported
by different methods of synthesis such as pyrazolo[1,2-a]pyridazine-5,8-diones, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazinones,
and pyrazolo[4,3-c]pyridazines.35 One of the isomers, namely, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazines, exhibits four tautomeric structures as shown in Scheme 1.

Scheme 2 Previous Reported
Synthesis of Pyrazolopyridazines/ones (Yield =

Several derivatives
of pyrazolopyridazines exhibit potential activities
such as antifungal,36 antibacterial,37 anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antihypoxic, antipyretic
agents,38 and antimicrobial actions.39 Also, some pyrazolopyridazine derivatives are
reported to be inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1),40 phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors, which
are widely used in therapeutic treatment of inflammatory and immune
disorders,41 including glycogen synthase
kinase 3 (GSK-3) inhibitors.42

During
the course of our studies directed toward the design and
synthesis of heterocycles employing a ring transformation of sydnones,
we have recently reported the newer heterocyclic scaffolds using 3-arylsydnones 1a–d as synthons.43−47 We, herein, report the serendipitous formation of
pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones
(7a–l) from hydrazone of 3-aryl-4-acetylsydnones 2a–d by intramolecular nucleophilic addition–elimination.
The synthetic route for the synthesized compounds is outlined in Scheme 3.

Results
and Discussion
Initially, our aim was cyclization of hydrazones 4a–l by the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to 3-(3-arylsydnon-4-yl)-1-aryl-1H-pyrazole-4-carbaldehydes 5a–l, which
was further planned to convert into benzimidazole derivatives 6a–l by condensing with o-phenylenediamines.
However, we did not get the expected aldehydes 5a–l but ended up with an unexpected product. For example, when a hydrazone 4a was reacted with DMF and POCl3 at 50–60
°C, the product upon mass spectral analysis exhibited a molecular
ion peak at 288 (m/z) instead of 332 (m/z), which is expected for a benzimidazole derivative 6a. We analyzed the product for the possible structure by spectral
analyses (IR, 1H and 13C NMR, GC–MS)
as well as by single-crystal X-ray studies and were successful in
establishing the structure of the compound as 7a. The
unusual reaction of forming fused ring, namely, pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones 7a–l via the Vilsmeier–Haack reagent, and an optimized condition
under both conventional and microwave irradiation were established.
This occurred by elimination of CO2 and water via acid-catalyzed
intramolecular nucleophilic addition–elimination in 3-aryl-4[(1-aryl-4-formyl-pyrazol-3-yl)]-sydnones 5a–l, which was not isolated.

The reaction mixture
was irradiated by microwave irradiation for
150 W at 120 °C. Interestingly, we observed the completion of
the reaction within 5–8 min with excellent yields (94–96%)
for all the title compounds 7a–l (Table 1). Compared to conventional
(6–7 h), microwave irradiation greatly reduced the reaction
time from 6–7 h to 5–8 min. The yield of the product
was also increased up to 94%. This report for pyrazolopyridazin-7-one
analogues 7a–l is more advantageous than other
reported methods32−34 as the synthetic method includes the shorter reaction
time, easy workup, and excellent yields by using DMF/POCl3 as a solvent. The proposed mechanism of conversion of hydrazone
of 4-acetyl-3-arylsydnones 4a–l to pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones 7a–l is presented in Scheme 4. It is also interesting to note that 3-aryl-4-substituted
sydnones have been used for ring transformation into various heterocycles.11 This is the first protocol being reported for
the ring transformation of hydrazone of 4-acetyl-3-arylsydnones 4a–l upon the Vilsmeier–Haack reaction to ring
transform into pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones 7a–l directly in excellent yields.

The reaction followed a simple
concerted mechanism. The mechanism
of transformation of hydrazone of 3-arylsydnones 1a–d to pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones (7a–l) occurred in three steps. In the
first step, the Vilsmeier–Haack reagent I is formed in situ by the reaction of POCl3 and DMF. This
attacks on CH2 of tautomer II to form intermediate III in step 2. Intermediate III undergoes elimination
of HCl to form intermediate IV, which further undergoes
removal of dimethyl amine followed by the attack of the Vilsmeier–Haack
reagent I once again, which forms an aldehyde 5a–l that was not possible to isolate. The reaction continued further
as in the third step of Scheme 3 as intramolecular acid-catalyzed nucleophilic addition–elimination,
which occurs through a protonated carbonyl group of aldehyde on pyrazole VIII. This is followed by elimination of CO2 (cycloreversion)
and water molecule from IX that gave the final compound 7a–l.

The structures of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones 7a–l were confirmed by spectroscopic
techniques, namely, IR, 1H and 13C NMR, GC–MS, single-crystal X-ray structure studies, and
elemental analyses. The compounds have shown a strong adsorption band
for carbonyl of pyridazinone and C=N of pyrazole ring at 1630–1679
and 1528–1609 cm–1, respectively. In the
case of 1H NMR spectral analyses, the compounds exhibited
a singlet in the range 9.94–10.06 ppm for pyridazin-7-one (C3–H) ring and pyrazole (C4–H) at 8.42–9.72
ppm. The aromatic protons of all phenyl rings appeared as multiplets
in the range 7.36–7.70 ppm. In the case of 13C NMR
spectral study, compounds have shown the number of signals, which
are consistent with number of magnetically nonequivalent carbon atoms
in the compound, and in mass spectra, the synthesized compounds have
shown the molecular ion peaks at their respective m/z values.

The crystalline nature of the compound is characterized
by long
range well-defined three-dimensional orders. An ORTEP view of the
compound 7d is presented in Figure 1. The crystal data and refinements are presented
in Table S1 in Supporting Information.
The X-ray structure clearly suggested that compound 7d crystallized as a triclinic system.

Conclusions
In
summary, we have successfully established a fused ring for the
first time from the sydnone in which the acid catalyzed intramolecular
nucleophilic addition–elimination reaction provides an efficient
means for the preparation of novel fused 2,6-diaryl-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones 7a–l under a microwave-assisted condition in good yields.
Formation of cyclized products along with formylation and intramolecular
nucleophilic addition followed by an elimination sequence of reactions
was presented. The other features of this protocol include mild conditions,
short reaction time, and easy workup.

Experimental Section
General
Information
All the reagents and chemicals
were purchased from Spectrochem and Sigma-Aldrich. Melting points
were measured in open capillaries and are uncorrected. The IR spectra
were recorded by a Nicolet Impact 410 FTIR spectrometer using KBr
pellets (range 4000–500 cm–1). The 1H NMR spectra were recorded at 400 MHz on a Bruker Avance FT NMR
spectrometer in DMSO-d6 solvent with tetramethylsilane
(TMS) as internal standard. 13C NMR spectra were recorded
at 100 MHz on a Bruker Avance FT NMR spectrometer in DMSO-d6 solvent with TMS as internal standard. The
mass spectra were recorded on Shimadzu GC–MS operating at 70
eV. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on 0.20 mm Aluchrosep
silica gel 60 F254 plates (SD Fine, Mumbai). Synthesis by microwave
irradiation was carried out using a CEM Discover microwave synthesizer
equipped with an IR sensor to monitor reaction temperatures.48

Procedure for the Synthesis of 4-Acetyl-3-arylsydnones
(2a–d)49
To
a suspension
of 5.20 g (0.0369 mol) of phosphorous pentoxide in dry xylene (20
mL) was added 2.00 g (0.0123 mol) of 3-arylsydnones 1a–d in a two-necked RB flask equipped with a reflux condenser with a
calcium chloride drying tube. The stirred mixture was heated to reflux
on a water bath. Glacial acetic acid of about 0.80 mL (0.0123 mol)
was added dropwise, and the reaction mixture was refluxed for 6 h
during which the resultant clear brown solution turned black. After
completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture was cooled to room
temperature. Xylene was then decanted, and the remaining black residue
was extracted twice with xylene (2 × 10 mL). Combined washings
and decanted xylene were evaporated to obtain a pale yellow solid
and recrystallized using ethanol to obtain pure compounds (2a–d).

Procedure for the Synthesis of 1-(3-Arylsydnon-4-yl)ethylidene)-2-phenylhydrazines
(4a–l)49
4-Acetyl-3-arylsydnones 2a–d (1.0 g, 0.005 mol) were dissolved in ethanol (10
mL), and about 3–4 drops of acetic acid were added. Aryl hydrazines 3a–c (0.50 mL, 0.0049 mol) were then added, and the
reaction mixture was refluxed for 2 h. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by TLC, and after completion of the reaction, the separated
solid was filtered, dried, and recrystallized from ethanol to obtain
the compounds 4a–l.

Procedure for the Synthesis

(7a–l)
DMF (1.16 mL, 0.015 mmol) in an
RB flask was cooled to 0 °C, and POCl3 (3.92 mL, 0.042
mmol) was added dropwise with constant stirring. To this adduct, 1-(3-arylsydnon-4-yl)ethylidene)-2-phenylhydrazines 4a–l (2.0 g, 0.006 mmol) was added and again stirred
for 10 min. The resulting solution was heated on a water bath for
10–12 h. After completion of the reaction, the reaction mixture
was cooled to RT and poured into crushed ice. The pale yellow solid
separated was filtered and washed with water to obtain the compounds 7a–l, which was recrystallized from ethanol.

Procedure
for Microwave-Assisted Synthesis of 2,6-Diphenyl-2H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyridazin-7(6H)-ones
(7a–l)
In a sealed glass tube
vial (30.0 mL), DMF (0.19 mL, 0.0025m mol) was taken and cooled to
0 °C, and POCl3 (0.65 mL, 0.007 mol) was added dropwise
with constant stirring. To this, 1-(3-arylsydnon-4-yl)ethylidene)-2-phenylhydrazines 4a–l (0.5 g, 0.0016 mol) was added and again stirred
for 10 min. The sealed vessel with the reaction mixture was prestirred
for 30 s at room temperature. The reaction mixture was then irradiated
by 150 W at 120 °C for about 5–8 min at medium stirring.
The completion of the reaction was monitored by TLC using hexane:ethylacetate
(7:3 drops) as an eluent. The reaction mixture was then quenched into
crushed ice, and the crude product obtained was filtered, washed,
and dried. It was recrystallized from ethanol to obtain pure crystals
of the compounds 7a–l.
