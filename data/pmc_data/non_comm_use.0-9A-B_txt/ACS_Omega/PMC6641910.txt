In
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), amyloid β (Aβ)
protein plays a detrimental role in neuronal injury and death. Recent
in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that soluble oligomers of the
Aβ peptide are neurotoxic. Structural properties of the oligomeric
assembly, however, are largely unknown. Our present investigation
established that the 40-residue-long Aβ peptide (Aβ40)
became more helical, ordered, and compact in the oligomeric state,
and both the helical and β-sheet components were found to increase
significantly in the early event of oligomerization. The band-selective
two-dimensional NMR analysis suggested that majority of the residues
from sequence 12 to 22 gained a higher-ordered secondary structure
in the oligomeric condition. The presence of a significant amount
of helical conformation was confirmed by Raman bands at 1650 and 1336
cm–1. Other residues remained mostly in the extended
polyproline II (PPII) and less compact β-conformation space.
In the event of maturation of the oligomers into an amyloid fiber,
both the helical content and the PPII-like structural components declined
and ∼72% residues attained a compact β-sheet structure.
Interestingly, however, some residues remained in the collagen triple
helix/extended 2.51-helix conformation as evidenced by
the amide III Raman signature band at 1272 cm–1.
Molecular dynamics analysis using an optimized potential for liquid
simulation force field with the peptide monomer indicated that some
of the residues may have preferences for helical conformation and
this possibly contributed in the event of oligomer formation, which
eventually became a β-sheet-rich amyloid fiber.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s
disease (AD) is a progressive dementia, and
considerable evidence indicates that the disease is triggered by neurotoxic
assemblies of the amyloid β (Aβ) peptide.1−4 Recent studies have shown that prefibrillar structures, such as
oligomers5−11 and protofibril,12−15 of the Aβ peptide are key toxic species in AD. Soluble oligomers
have been found to cause physical damage of synapses.16 Oligomers have also been implicated in memory failure in
transgenic mice.17−19 Fibrillization of α-synuclein in Parkinson’s
disease (PD) also involves the formation of similar oligomeric intermediates.20,21 Thus, prevention of oligomerization becomes an attractive therapeutic
target for neuropathology of amyloid disease.4,22−26 However, very little is known about the protein/peptide conformation
and the thermodynamics of the associated conformational changes during
oligomer and fibril formation. The current investigation focused on
the conformation and molecular details of the peptide in its oligomeric
intermediate states. The results may clarify some of the fundamental
questions regarding the molecular mechanism of amyloid formation,
synaptic toxicity, and the nature of the intermolecular interactions
that stabilize the oligomeric assembly of the peptide.

Early
studies of amyloid formation of the Aβ peptide were
largely centered on fibril morphology,27 and most of the structural investigations were focused on fibrillar
assembly by solid-state NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectroscopic analyses. These studies suggested that in the fibrillar
form the peptide attained a β-sheet conformation.28 Conformational studies of the monomeric Aβ
peptide were often performed by circular dichroism (CD), FTIR, and
NMR spectroscopic analyses.29,30 In vitro solution-phase
NMR studies suggested that monomers of Aβ possessed no α-helical
or β-sheet structure.31,32 Both Aβ40 and
Aβ42 favored a predominately random and extended conformation.31 Following fibril formation, however, Aβ
peptides attained a predominately β-sheet conformation28,33−35 within a repeating polymeric peptide assembly. Fiber
X-ray diffraction analyses showed that Aβ fibrils contained
cross-β structural motifs. In vitro solid-state NMR experiments
on synthetic Aβ fibrils established a parallel β-sheet
structure.35

The scarcity of structural
information of oligomer intermediates
arises due to their transient nature and the solubility problem. Their
solubility and size render structural analysis by solution NMR problematic.
X-ray crystallography is of no use, as crystals of the oligomeric
intermediates cannot be obtained. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provides
morphological features of fibrils and some intermediates of Aβ7,36,37 and the morphology of other amyloidogenic
aggregated proteins, including α-synuclein,38 lysozyme,39 and prion protein.40 However, the conformation of the protein backbone
in the toxic oligomers has not been studied in detail. Lansbury et
al. suggested that spherical oligomers of α-synuclein were rich
in the β-sheet structure.41 Walsh
et al. and Kirkitadze et al. provided limited structural information
of the Aβ oligomeric intermediate on the basis of CD analysis.5,15,42,43

However, the detailed structural organizations starting from
its
monomeric state to the oligomer and fibril are less discussed and
very little understood. In the current investigation, with a 40-residue-long
Aβ40 peptide, we established that the peptide became more helical,
ordered, and compact in the oligomeric state. Our analysis also suggested
that the secondary structural fluctuation along with tertiary refolding
stimulated the propagation of amyloid fiber formation and related
aggregation. The band-selective-optimized-flip-angle short-transient
(SOFAST)-heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence (HMQC) two-dimensional
(2D) NMR measurements indicated that most of the residues in the sequence
stretch from 12 to 22 in Aβ40 possessed strong propensities
to acquire an ordered secondary structure in the very early event
of oligomerization. In addition, analysis of the amide mode vibrations
in the Raman spectra of the peptide confirmed the presence of a significant
helical conformation in the oligomeric assembly structure.

Results
and Discussion
Residue-Specific Conformation of Soluble
Aβ Oligomer
Aβ40 was dissolved (1.5 mg/mL) in
a 10 mM phosphate buffer
at pH 7.2, and both NMR and Raman spectroscopic measurements were
made with this sample to derive structural information of the peptide.
Two-dimensional 15N,1H heteronuclear correlation
spectra of Aβ40 showed poor dispersion (∼1.1 ppm) of
most of the backbone 1HN resonances and appeared
between 7.5 and 8.4 ppm (Figure 1). In addition, the line widths were sharp, and very
slow relaxation in the indirect dimension leads to a high acquisition
time (t1 max), which is typical for
unfolded macromolecules and indicated a lack of globular fold. To
monitor the structural heterogeneity and compactness in a residue-specific
manner, we have recorded one set of experiments. These experiments
are based on the SOFAST-HMQC experiment, which was designed for rapid
acquisition of heteronuclear correlation spectra of proteins. The
hetero-SOFAST NMR experiments incorporate an additional band-selective
inversion pulse at the beginning of the pulse sequence and the recycle
period to act as the contact time.9,10 Two experiments
are recorded with (excited) and without (reference) that specific
selective pulse, and the ratio of peak volumes are taken. Among the
different sets of experiments, this selective pulse differs. This
selective pulse can be on aliphatic protons, which have a distinct
chemical shift range (0–4 ppm), compared to that of the amide
proton chemical shift (6–10 ppm for folded proteins). The experiment
measures the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) between the perturbed
aliphatic protons and the observed amide protons after a contact time
of 200 ms.

Figure 1 Solution-state NMR. (A) Two-dimensional [15N/1H] SOFAST-HMQC spectra of 15N-labeled Aβ40 (1.5
mg/mL) dissolved in a 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.6. Residue numbers
are marked in red. (B) Bar plot of λNOE (the ratio
of effective spin diffusion of amide protons in the presence and absence
of a selective pulse) against different residues of Aβ40 (details
are given in Experimental Section).

The observed ratio (λNOE) probe the effective
spin diffusion of that particular 1HN spin.
This depends on the spin network around that particular spin and incorporates
various factors such as number, density, and mobility of other close
protons. This ratio thus can probe local structural propensity effectively
in a residue-wise manner. For small unfolded peptides, the value can
go above 0.8. For Aβ40, the average λNOE value
was 0.76 and indicated that most of the peptide bond remained in the
disordered region. However, the signal from residue stretches of 12–15,
17–19, and 21–22 showed a λNOE of less
than 0.7, and these occurrences may be due to the proximity of the
protons that can cause more spin diffusion (Figure 1). This observation suggested that these
segments possessed some residual structure. In addition, the residues
32 and 34 also showed λNOE values of less than 0.7
and indicated that these two residues could be part of an ordered
component.

The phenomenon of accessing alternate states could
possibly act
as an initiation point of mutual interactions as the residues 32 and
34 have been involved in making a tertiary fold, which was confirmed
in the fibrillar state by various studies.44−46 Here also in
the initiation phase of aggregation, our finding of accessing of alternate
structures by residues 32 and 34 and the residue stretch of 12–22
provides a firm experimental support for the final topology of interaction
and structural reorganization in the oligomeric state. We observed
no new peak appearing in the HMQC spectra over time. As time progressed,
peaks started disappearing. This implied the formation of oligomers
of different sizes, which were large enough to be beyond the detection
limit. From the NMR analysis, we probed the residues that access alternate
structures in the initial phase of aggregation; however, an additional
structural insight in a different state of aggregation was derived
from the peptide bond vibration analysis via Raman spectroscopic measurement
(Scheme S1).

Raman Spectra of Aβ40
and Quantification of Peptide Secondary
Structure
Figures 2 and 3, respectively, show the Raman
spectra and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of Aβ40
oligomers. Figure S1 displays the Raman
spectra of the Aβ40 monomer (upper trace) and matured fibril
(bottom trace) in the frequency range of 1200–1800 cm–1. Table S1 provides assignments of some
of the characteristic Raman bands. The amide I vibration bands often
appear in the range of 1620–1700 cm–1, and
it primarily represents C=O stretching; out-of-phase C–N
motion also contributes to this band vibration. The peptide Raman
spectrum in the monomeric state was dominated by a broad amide I band
at 1675 cm–1. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
was ∼35 cm–1. It was diagnostic of a highly
fluctuating/dynamic secondary structure and could be a marker for
a polyproline II (PPII)-like conformation.47−50 Thus, the amide I Raman band
intensity data indicated that the secondary structural preference
of the residues in Aβ40 as the monomer was mainly PPII-like
conformation (77%) as defined in the Ramachandran plot. Table 1 shows the content of different
conformational states of the monomer, oligomer, and fibrils of Aβ40.
The values were obtained by fitting the broad amide band with different
component bands. The area under each component band was proportionate
to a particular kind of secondary structure (Figures 2B and S2).48,51 A component band centered at
∼1650 cm–1 (Figure S2A) that fitted well with the amide I Raman band of the peptide in
the monomeric state could be linked to a short helical kink-like structure. Figure 2 displays the Raman
spectra of the peptide in the oligomeric state. It contained a broad
amide I band centered at 1667 cm–1 with an FWHM
of ∼29 cm–1. The secondary structural distributions
in the oligomeric state are shown in Figure 2B and listed in Table 1. In the oligomeric species, the helical
content was 31% (component band at 1650 cm–1), whereas
the β-strand/sheet content was 36% and was represented by a
fitted band at 1666 cm–1, and the PPII-like conformation
was 33% with a signature band at 1680 cm–1. In the
state of amyloid β late assembly in the form of a fiber, the
width of the amide I band was found to shrink; the value was close
to 21 cm–1 and appeared at 1665 cm–1 (Figures S1 and S2). The narrow and sharp
vibration band indicated a cross β-sheet conformation of the
peptide in the fibrillar state (Figure S2B). A significant decrease of the PPII conformation was prominent,
and the helical content was also declined; interestingly, however,
the PPII-type signature was reduced maximally (Table 1 and Figure S2).

oligomers in the frequency range of 1150–1800 cm–1 by a 532 nm laser. Oligomerized peptide solution was prepared in
a 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. The peptide solution (1.5 mg/mL)
was incubated for 3 h at room temperature. To record the Raman spectrum,
20 μL of the sample solution was dropped onto a glass cover
slip and the spectra were recorded at room temperature (25 °C).
Laser power at the source was 30–35 mW, ∼2 mW at the
sample. The recording scan time was 15 s, and the number of scans
was 10. The displayed spectrum was the average of three/five such
measurements. (B) Curve fitting of the amide I region of the Raman
spectrum. The band fitting was based on a standard protocol as stated
in Experimental Section. Three component bands
that represent total amide I bands are shown separately. The violet
line is the original spectrum, the red, blue, yellow, green lines
are the individual component bands, and the cyan line is the sum of
the bands. The fitted peak positions are also marked. 1604 cm–1 corresponds to vibration from the side chain residue.

Significant Number of Residues
Attain an α-Helical Structure
in the Oligomer
Figure 2C shows the amide III region (1200–1350 cm–1) in the Raman spectrum of oligomeric species, which
also signified the results obtained from the amide I band. Weak bands
at 1258 and 1319 cm–1 indicated the presence of
a significant number of residues in the α-helical space.52−54 The Aβ40 oligomer also exhibited a distinct band at 1336 cm–1 (Figure 2A and Table S1). Thomas et al.
suggested that the band near 1340–1345 cm–1 is a marker for α-helices and assigned it to the vibration
localized specifically to the O=C–Cα–H
linkage of the main peptide backbone.53 A signatory band near 1336 cm–1 in the Raman spectra
of the Aβ40 oligomer (Figure 2A) suggested that the peptide bond geometry may be
within the conformation of the α-helical structure.53,54 The band became much weaker in the fibrillar state (Figure S1) and confirmed the transition of the
helical conformation into a β-sheet structure. The band at 1434
cm–1 in the oligomer state was assigned to CH2–, CH3– deformation and CH2– scissoring motion. The band was sharper than the corresponding
band at 1448 cm–1 for the monomer (Figure S1). This again supported the fact that the peptide
chain became more compact.

The peptide in a largely monomeric
state in the aqueous buffer showed a significant negative signature
at 198 nm in the CD spectra. It is often assigned to the n−π*
transition and indicated that the residues mostly preferred the PPII-like
conformation47 (Figure 3 left). However, the presence of helical
content in the oligomerized peptide was imminent; an increase of the
negative signal at 222 nm due to n−π* electronic transition
was observed with ellipticity at 222 nm (Θ222nm was
−0.91 mdeg) in the monomer, and the value became more negative
(−4.96 mdeg) in the oligomeric state. Thus, the oligomeric
population substantially inherited PPII and extended helix or combination
of several short helical components (the absence of a strong positive
signal for perpendicular π–π* transition at 192
nm indicated a lack of a very compact and large α-helical fold).

Ahmed et al. were able to prepare on-pathway oligomers under a
low salt condition, keeping the temperature relatively low.55 They found no compact β-sheet secondary
structure in Aβ42 oligomers. We also observed that the oligomers
obtained in our preparation showed minimal binding to ThT (Figure S5). However, a very broad band at 1232
cm–1 indicated some residues with a β-conformation
space. All these studies indicated that the peptide in the oligomeric
state had less preference for a compact cross β-sheet structure.
The fiber showed a major amide III signal (Figure S3) at 1221 cm–1 with a shoulder band at
1232 cm–1. The shift and compactness of the band
indicated the presence of a β-sheet structure.48,51,54,56 The band became much sharper compared to that of the same band in
the oligomeric state and effectively enhanced the ThT fluorescence
(Figure S5). Wälti et al. in their
recent article also suggested that in disease-relevant Aβ42
fibril, each layer of the fibril is composed of two molecules and
the residues spanning between 15 and 42 adopt a horseshoe-like β-sheet
conformation. The CD spectral signature of the amyloid fiber indicated
that the peptide attained largely a β-sheet conformation and
was devoid of the PPII conformation. It produced a positive signature
at 196 nm (n−π* transition), suggesting a lack of large
PPII contribution, and a negative minimum at 218 nm (π–π*
transition) suggested a β-sheet structure.

Increase in
the α-Helical Structure
Benevides
et al. observed a very confirmative tertiary signature with a helix
for the HK97 capsid assembly with a reliable Raman indicator at 933
cm–1.57,58 The 800–1200
cm–1 region of the Raman spectra of Aβ40 oligomers
were overcrowded with signals at 929, 944 cm–1,
and many others (Table S1 and Figure S4). These bands indicated the presence of a backbone tertiary helical
structure and the conformational heterogeneity in the oligomeric assembly.54,56−58

Earlier Raman investigation with helical viral
proteins also found a nonamide marker band for the helical secondary
structure, and an associated tertiary fold was assigned at 1340 cm–1. The band was assigned to C–Cα–H
valence angle bending. The isotope-edited study further confirmed
that the O=C–Cα–H stretching motion contributes
substantially to this vibration band. The band intensity was found
to depend on the content of the α-helical structure, and least
intensity suggests lesser amount of the α-helical fold. The
band (intensity) also can guide the orientation (tertiary structure)
of the α-helical segment in the protein. In our investigation,
we observed the band at 1336 cm–1, which was found
to substantially decrease in the fibrillar state and indicated a significant
reorientation and decrease of the helical structure. With viral capsid
proteins, it was suggested that α-helices may be short and connected
by loops or disordered segments consisting of a few residues each.59 The helical signature band referenced at 1335–1340
cm–1 in viral proteins particularly was present
in the intermediate capsid (procapsid) structure of viral coat proteins.52

N-Terminal Residues Preserve Collagen Triple
Helix-Type/Extended
2.51-Helix Conformation
Majority of earlier investigations
indicated that residues 1–14 may have some structural preferences.60 Our Raman spectroscopic analysis found minor
amide III signals at 1275, 1277, and 1272 cm–1 for
the monomer, oligomer, and fiber, respectively, and attributed it
to the collagen triple helix type/extended 2.51-helix61,62 type of conformation. Asher et al. experimentally showed a stable
2.51-helix conformation in a model peptide (PGA) and found
a signature of the conformation at 1271 cm–1.61 The structure was close to those in a PPII-like
conformation; however, a larger separation distance appeared among
the charge groups in the 2.51-helix conformation state.
This region may be present in all the three states (monomer, oligomer,
and fiber) of the peptide conformation. It is a highly extended PPII-like
conformation and may be confined in the N-terminal residues (1–10)
because the λNOE values were large (>0.75). These
residues are highly polar and dynamic (MD calculations are provided
in the supporting material). Petkova et al. also observed the extended
structure of the region even in the fibrillar state.63,64

The intriguing fact in our observation was that upon oligomerization
of the peptide, it became more helical, ordered, and compact. The
existing literature from different experimental studies showed two
significant points regarding the oligomer structure and the pathway
of aggregation: (i) the amyloid oligomer mainly contained two well-defined
secondary structures, β-strand and PPII; and (ii) the major
structural change from monomer to oligomer proceeded via conversion
of the PPII conformer to the β-strand, which was further extended
to form a well-defined cross-β-sheet structure in the fibrillar
state. However, our Raman analyses established a key information that
the residues distributed in the helical and β-domain similar
to a molten globule-like architecture65,66 before it
transformed into a β-sheet-rich amyloid fiber. It was not a
simple one-way structural conversion of PPII to the β-sheet
structure. It is comparable to another disordered protein, α-synuclien,47 which also contained some signature of the helical
structure in the oligomeric state.

Conformational Clustering
of the Peptide and Ramachandran (ψ/Φ)
Space of the Residues by Molecular Dynamics (MD) Simulation
An early event of protein/peptide folding may govern the higher-order
aggregation, such as amyloid fibril formation.65 To realize this folding event, often MD simulation is carried
out as a powerful computational method.67−74 MD simulation was engaged in the current investigation to inspect
early dynamics and overall conformational changes of Aβ40 as
a monomer and dimer in a water system. The initial Aβ40 coordinates
were taken from PDB entry 1BA4 and were subjected to simulation at 310 K for several
nanoseconds. We analyzed the simulation trajectories, which include
the measurements of root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the α-carbons from its
initial values, radius of gyration (Rg) of the peptide, and the secondary structure. Figure 4A shows the RMSDs of the Cα atoms and Rg values of the peptide against simulation time.
In the beginning of the simulation, the RMSD was fluctuating and the
values were in the range of 0.2–1.3 nm. However, after 400
ns of simulation, the fluctuation in the RMSD was minimized and an
equilibrium conformation was reached. In the subsequent interval of
∼1000 ns, no significant fluctuation of RMSD was observed and
it remained stable with average values of ∼1.2 nm. The Rg was also stabilized at about 600 ns, and the
value was ∼0.9 nm. This suggested that the convergence of the
simulation occurred and Aβ40 attained significant stability
at this point of time. The conformational clustering (density distribution)
of Aβ40 against RMSD and Rg is shown
in Figure 4B. At an Rg value of 0.9 nm and an RMSD of 1.2 nm, the
peptide gained significant stability and compactness. Figure 4C displays the snapshots of
the conformation of the peptide at different time intervals. In the
early state of the simulation, the peptide, for instance at 160 ns
of simulation, was mostly disordered (Rg = 1.3 nm); however, with the increase in the simulation time, Aβ40
adopted more a compact and helical conformation with a decrease in
the Rg value. At the end point (960 ns),
we observed the presence of some helical content at residues 11–15
and 29–34.

simulation. The 3D histogram plot of Rg against RMSD shows the conformational clustering, where f is the frequency. (C) Structures generated at different
time intervals of simulation and representative snapshots are shown.
The simulation time and the Rg for each
snapshot are given. The lower blue scattered plot shows the refinements
in the radius of gyration of the Aβ40 backbone in the same time
frame. N-Terminus of the peptide was marked by the Asp residue in
the CPK model.

The residue-specific
average secondary structural preference of
the peptide is shown in Figure 5A. The analysis indicated helical preferences among residues
10–15, 17–21, and 28–36 segments, and a weak
β-strand preference was observed of residues 37–38. These
three different helical abundant amyloid segments might have a tendency
to adopt a helical conformation during the early event of self-assembly
as the conformational adaptation. This result was similar to the earlier
NMR study of Aβ40 in which residue stretch 13–23 was
shown to have a 310-helix conformation.75 Vivekanandan et al. showed that Aβ40 can adopt a
partially folded structure.75 A collapsed
coil structure was observed with the fragment of the peptide (residues
from 10 to 35). It was also indicated in the CD spectral data and
NMR analysis as discussed earlier.

average secondary structural preferences of the peptide. The color
codes are as follows: white for loop, orange for helical conformation,

residue number of the peptide as the residue index. (B) Three-dimensional
plot of the distribution of Ramachandran dihedral angles (ψ
and Φ) of all the residues present in the peptide. The z axis represents the frequency of occurrences.

The frequency of dihedral angles phi (Φ)
and psi (Ψ)
was monitored during the simulation time. The plot of the dihedral
angle frequencies in a Ramachandran-like graph provides conformational
preferences of the peptide. The major Ramachandran ψ/Φ
angle distribution, as obtained by the MD analysis was found to peak
at Ramachandran coordinates of ψ = −26° and Φ
= −75° (Figure 5B). Three other comparatively week distributions were at (ψ
= −140°, Φ = −24°), (ψ = +138°,
Φ = −83°), and (ψ = +150°, Φ =
−146°) in the Ramachandran (ψ, Φ) space. In
the major ψ/Φ distribution, the Φ values were close
to the right-handed α-helical space and the ψ values were
close to the 310 helix.

Possible conformational changes
of the peptide as a dimer, which
is believed to form in the early event of oligomerization of Aβ40,
is shown in Figure 6 and compared with the conformational state of the monomer over an
equal time of simulation. The total simulation time for the dimer
was 450 ns. The backbone RMSD values for the dimer remained relatively
low (1.1 nm), indicating their stability over the simulation time
(Figure S6). It was found that a significant
amount of the α-helix persisted for the dimer along with some
residues with a turn conformation. Over a 450 ns simulation, a good
number of residues attained the α-helix. The formation of some
helix pattern in the sequence regions 13–16 and 28–36
was observed in the dimer (Figures 6 and S7).

Figure 6 Snapshots of the conformational
state of the Aβ40 peptide
monomer (upper panel) and dimer (lower panel) over different time
scales of MD simulations in water at 310 K using the Desmond algorithm.
The peptide coloring schemes are as follows: red for helical conformation
and gray for unstructured region.

The residue-specific interaction pattern (contact map) of
the dimer
of the Aβ40 peptide over a simulation period of 450 ns is shown
in Figure S8. The contact probability map
was made using all conformations generated at the full trajectory
of the MD simulation. The residue segment, Leu17-Ala21, in one peptide
and residues Gln15, Val18, and Ala21 in the other peptide were found
to make high contact with each other. Contact probability in the Leu17-Ala21
of one peptide with Gly29-Met35 of the other peptide of the Aβ40
dimer was also observed. Many of these residues were in the segment
that has the tendency to form a helical pattern. Tarus et al. examined
the dimer of Aβ40 by molecular dynamics analysis and observed
about 18% β-strand and 10% α helix residues. Their investigation
also showed that one peptide segment with a β-sheet structure
was stabilized by a peptide component with an α-helical structure.73

The results of the MD analysis largely
depend on the accuracy and
nature of the force fields embedded in the algorithm and the accompanying
solvation models.76 However, in our current investigation,
we used the optimized potential for liquid simulation (OPLS)/AA force
field embedded in the Desmond algorithm. This was also used earlier
to investigate the similar protein peptide dynamics. Earlier investigation
using the OPLS force field found good agreement with the generated
structures for Aβ40 and Aβ42 and their fragments with
the experimental results.76,77 Gerben et al. found
that OPLS-AA, GROMOS96 53A6, and GROMOS96 54A7 produce quite similar
secondary structures (in terms of the helical and β-strand content)
and matches well with the experimental results.77 Man et al. in their very recent investigation used four
different force fields and observed different levels of helix content
in the Aβ42 dimer; however, the helix content calculated by
the OPLS-AA force field was comparable to CD data.70 When studying the effect of different force fields on peptide
aggregation, Nguyen et al. also showed that OPLS/AA explored the most
diverse conformations for the aggregation of the Aβ16–22
fragment in explicit water.78

Neumaier
et al. investigated the helix–coil transition in
helix-forming peptides and suggested that upon formation of the helix
from the coil conformation a shrinkage of volume is eminent.80,79 Our simulation results also showed that compactness, as measured
by the radius of gyration (Rg), decreases
in the early event of folding as in the intermediate state. As a whole,
MD simulation results indicated that the Aβ40 peptide had long-range
residual preferences in unfoldedness; however, there was a strong
helical tendency in aggregation-prone amyloidogenic regions. Thus,
the observed compactness of the peptide as a monomer and its preferences
of some of the residues for an ordered secondary structure may have
a role in the processes of amyloid formation. We observed both the
helical and β sheet content in the Raman spectroscopic measurement
of the peptide in a different state of its aggregation, and our MD
analysis indicated that the monomer itself may have attained some
of this structure before its transformation into higher-order aggregates
such as oligomer and fibril.

The C-terminal region of the peptide
is more extended than the
N-terminal region.81−84 Earlier molecular dynamics simulations predicted a partially structured
monomeric state of the peptide.85−87 Our MD simulation analysis (based
on the plot in Figure 5A) found that a maximum of 45% of the residues had helical propensity,
∼15% of which showed strong helical tenacity. We also observed
that the λNOE for residue stretches of 12–15,
17–19, and 21–22 showed a low λNOE value
for the amide protons, as stated earlier. A previous solid-state experimental
study of Aβ40 by Petkova et al. showed that the main hydrophobic
cross β-sheet core of the Aβ40 fiber (PDB: 2LMN) primarily consisted
of LVFFAD (residues 17–22) and AIIGLM (residues 34–39).28 These segments were partially overlapping regions
with our predicted most helicity-prone amyloid segment as obtained
from MD simulation (Figure 5). The calculated grand averages of hydropathy of residue
segments 17–21 and 28–36 are considerably high, and
the values were 3.08 and 1.78, respectively. Thus, the regions may
have a tendency to cause hydrophobic collapse in the processes of
amyloid formation.

Our MD results and some of the previous investigations
suggested
that the peptide as a monomer itself has propensities to form some
helical and β-sheet structure. The driving force of accelerated
conversion of the monomer to early assembly formation of the oligomeric
state could be the reconstruction of the highly energetic disordered
peptide into two relatively stable ordered conformations, such as
the helical fold and β-sheet/strand structures.88 Partial compact structures were also found for other amyloidogenic
proteins. In the recent past, IR studies showed that the Josephin
domain of ataxin-3 transformed into an amyloid fiber via formation
of native oligomers, which possess both the random coil and α-helix
conformations.89,90 These observations indicated
that, like many other disordered proteins, the Aβ peptide may
also contain a premolten globule state in its monomeric state just
before the formation of oligomers, and some of these conformational
states may be transmitted in the early stage of the soluble oligomer,
which eventually transformed into the insoluble amyloid fiber.

Conclusions
In the current investigation, on the basis of mainly the Raman
and CD spectroscopy data, we reported the content of a secondary structure
of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ40) as a monomer and when
it formed soluble oligomers and a highly insoluble amyloid fiber.
It was found that ∼77% residues of the peptide as a monomer
favored a disordered PPII-like conformation. However, in the oligomeric
form the peptide contained residues distributed in the α-helical,
PPII, and β-conformational spaces. Thus, the Raman signature
suggested bifold secondary structural alteration (both helix and β
conformation) in the processes of oligomerization of the peptide and
disfavored the general assumption that the amyloid aggregation occurred
through one direction, that is, mere β-conformational space
transformation of the residues from its major PPII geometry in the
monomeric state. However, in the fibrilar state the peptide mainly
attained a β-sheet structure. Thus, the peptide secondary structure
in the oligomeric state was very different from the fibrillar assembly.
Like membrane fusion by a viral protein, the presence of helical segments
in the oligomeric assembly may help the transmission of a toxic small
oligomer from cell to cell. The observed result may thus be useful
to understand the possible mechanism of Aβ aggregation and its
link to disease formation and progression. This may also aid to design
possible therapeutics targeting the region, particularly those show
helical propensity, and to induce structural contact. Targeting completely disordered
regions by a small molecule is very difficult due to the coexistence
of an equivalent energetic ensemble of conformations or rather conformationally
stable geometrical segments. In that sense, targeting residual segments,
particularly in the sequence range of 12–22, may be more reliable
compared to targeting highly disordered C-terminal residues to stop
the formation of a soluble oligomer, which is believed now to be a
potent neurotoxic species involving Aβ peptides in ADs.

Experimental
Section
Sample Preparation
The peptide, full-length Aβ40,
was purchased from American Peptide Company (777 E. Evelyn Ave., Sunnyvale,
CA). Aβ40 was dissolved (1.5 mg/mL) in a 10 mM phosphate buffer
of pH 7.2. The oligomerized peptide solution was prepared from the
same monomeric solution by incubating for 3 h. The Aβ40 fibril
was generated by dissolving the peptide (1.5 mg/mL) in the same buffer
condition and incubating for 2 days at 25 °C.

Thioflavin
T (ThT)-Binding Fluorescence Assay
A stock
ThT dye was made (1 mM) in double-distilled water and stored in a
cold and dark place. To monitor amyloid fibrillation, 600 μL
of assay buffer [100 μM ThT in 20 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.2)] was
mixed with 8 μL of incubated amyloid solution. The stock (1.5
mg/mL) was mixed properly before the fluorescence experiments. The
mixed solution was taken in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette, and
the fluorescence measurement was performed using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence
spectrophotometer. Emission spectra were acquired from 450 to 600
nm, excited at 440 nm, and the integration time was 1 s. Slit widths
were 5 nm each. ThT in buffer without protein was also measured and
used as the baseline.

CD
The far-UV CD spectra (190–250
nm) were recorded
on a JASCO J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco) equipped with a Peltier
temperature control unit. All of the CD measurements were performed
at 25 °C with an accuracy of ±0.1 °C. The data acquisition
interval value was 2 s. Spectra were recorded using a 0.1 cm path
length cell with a 50 nm/min scan speed. For each sample, three scans
were averaged, and the buffer background was subtracted. CD experimental
studies at three different time intervals were performed using (1.5
mg/mL) Aβ40 in a 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) at 25 °C.
For CD analysis, 20 μL of the peptide sample (stock 1.5 mg/mL)
was dissolved in 600 μL of the same PBS buffer to get a diluted
solution of a concentration of about 10 μM.

Raman Spectroscopy
Raman spectra were recorded using
a STR Raman spectrometer (model from AIRIX Corp.) equipped with a
microscope (Olympus BX51 M, Japan) and 500 mm focal length triple
grating monochromator connected with a charge-coupled device detector.
The laser was focused through a 50× objective, and the scattered
light from the sample was collected using the same objectives. The
samples were excited with a 532 nm wavelength laser light, with 30–35
mW of radiant power at the source and ∼2 mW at the sample.
The recording time was 15 s, and number of scans was 10. The wavenumbers
of the Raman spectra were calibrated with the Raman band of silica
wafer at 519 cm–1. Spectra were recorded from a
spectral range of 500–1800 cm–1. Spectra
were processed with the GRAMS/A1 software.

Curve Fitting of Amide
I Band
The amide I band in the
Raman spectra was used to investigating the changes of the secondary
structure of the peptide. The band fitting process of the Raman amide
I band was performed by the use of a Levenberg–Marquardt nonlinear
least-squares process as applied in Curve Fit Ab routine in the GRAMS/AI
9.02 software.91 The Raman amide I mode
(1580–1720 cm–1) was fitted assuming three
or four symmetrical component bands that represent the different conformational
states the peptide: α-helix (1650–1655 cm–1), β-sheet (1664–1670 cm–1), and polyproline
II or extended β-strand (1670–1680 cm–1). During amide I band fitting, two different bands centered at 1604
and 1615 cm–1 for the ring vibrational mode of phenylalanine
and tyrosine were also incorporated. A linear baseline correction
was considered during the fitting processes. The standard error for
both the peak positions and peak widths were ∼<5 cm–1, and uncertainty in the area measurement was ∼10%
of the total area.

NMR Spectroscopy
All NMR data collection
was done at
283 K on a BRUKER Avance NMR spectrometer equipped with a cryogenically
cooled triple resonance probe. Freshly prepared full-length Aβ40
peptide sample was used. The concentration was the same as in the
Raman experiments (1.5 mg/mL). Chemical shifts were calibrated with
respect to standard 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate for proton,
and 15N chemical shifts were calibrated indirectly. The
sample had 10% 2H2O for deuterium locking. For
efficient fast data acquisition, we have implemented SOFAST HSQC owing
to the combined advantage of a small number of radio-frequency pulses,
Ernst-angle excitation, and longitudinal relaxation optimization to
perform the experiment with a high repetition rate to achieve a high
signal to noise ratio using a small interscan delay period. Two-dimensional
[15N,1H]-SOFAST-HMQC was recorded with the 1H carrier placed at the center of the amide region (8.5 ppm)
and with the 15N carrier at 117.5 ppm. Selective excitation
in the amide region was achieved with a 120° polychromatic pulse
with 3 ms delay. For inversion, the R-SNOB pulse with 1 ms was used.
Hetero-SOFAST NMR experiments incorporate an additional band-selective
inversion pulse at the beginning of the pulse sequence, and 200 ms
was used as the contact time. Two experiments are recorded with (excited)
and without (reference) that specific inversion pulse, and the ratio
of peak volumes are taken. Among the different sets of experiments,
this selective pulse differs. This selective pulse (R-SNOB) was applied
on aliphatic protons, which have a distinct chemicals shift range
(0–4 ppm) compared to that of the amide proton chemical shift
(6–10 ppm for folded proteins). Each experiment was acquired
with 256 × 2048 complex points along the 15N and 1H dimensions, with an acquisition time of 63 ms and 107 ms,
respectively. All of the data were processed with TOPSPIN 3.2 and
were analyzed using CARA.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Transmission Electron
Microscopy has performed on a JEOL 1200EX transmission EM operating
with an accelerating voltage of 120 kV. The protein sample (5 μL)
was drop casted on 400 mesh copper grids (PST product, GSCu300C-50)
for 5 min. Excess solution was adsorbed onto a filter paper. The grids
were washed three times with distilled water and three times with
filtered 1% uranyl acetate for negative staining and then dried for
20 min at room temperature.

MD Simulation (Desmond)
MD simulation
analysis was
performed using the Desmond Molecular Dynamics System 4.0. Wild-type
Aβ40 was taken from PDB ID 1BA4.92 The Aβ40
peptide was solvated using the SPC water environment in a cubic box
of 1 nm edge distance from any solute atom. For simulation of the
dimer, we took two monomers with mostly an α-helical secondary
structure in a cubic box and brought them into close proximity (∼3
nm). The total charge of the systems was neutralized with appropriate
counterions. The OPLS 2005 force field parameter was used for this
simulation.93 The initial system was subjected
to energy minimization to 2000 steps of steepest descent integration
to eliminate unfavorable contacts or steric clashes between the atoms.
The pressure was regulated using the Martyna–Tobias–Klein
method to 1 bar with isotropic coupling and a relaxation time of 2
ps, and a constant simulation temperature of 310 K was maintained
using Nosé–Hoover thermostats.94−96 The equations
of motion were integrated using the multistep RESPA integrator with
bonded or near and far nonbonded interactions, at time steps of 2,
2, and 6 fs, respectively.97 Nonbonded
interactions were subjected to a cutoff of 0.9 nm. Long-range electrostatics
was treated with the smooth particle mesh Ewald method with a tolerance
of 10–9. A five-step relaxation protocol was used
starting with Brownian dynamics for 100 ps with restraints on solute
heavy atoms at NVT (with T = 10 K), followed by 12
ps of dynamics with restraints at NVT (T = 10 K)
and then at NPT (T = 10 K) using the Berendsen method.
Then, the temperature was raised to 300 K for 12 ps, followed by a
24 ps relaxation step without restraints on the solute heavy atoms.
The production MD was run at NPT with T = 310 K for
1000 ns. The molecular dynamics simulation trajectories were analyzed
using a simulation event analysis tool, and all of the images were
rendered using the Schrodinger Maestro Suite.
