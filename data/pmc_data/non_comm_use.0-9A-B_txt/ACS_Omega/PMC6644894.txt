Conjugated porous
polymers (CPPs) possess great potential in the
energy storage aspect. In this work, a boron-dipyrromethene (BODIPY)-conjugated
porous polymer (CPP-1) is achieved by a traditional organic synthesis
route. Following this, a carbonization process is employed to obtain
the carbonized porous material (CPP-1-C). The two as-prepared samples,
which are characterized by doping with heteroatoms and their porous
structure, are able to shorten the lithium-ion pathways and improve
the lithium-ion storage property. Then, CPP-1 and CPP-1-C are applied
as anode materials in lithium-ion batteries. As expected, long-term
cyclic performances at 0.1 and 1 A g–1 are achieved
with maintaining the specific capacity at 273.2 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–1 and 250.8 mA h g–1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g–1. The
carbonized sample exhibits a better electrochemical performance with
a reversible specific capacity of 675 mA h g–1 at
0.2 A g–1. Moreover, the capacity is still stabilized
at 437 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g–1. These results demonstrate that BODIPY-based CPPs
are capable of being exploited as promising candidates for electrode
materials in the fields of energy storage and conversion.

Introduction
The past decades have
witnessed the problems of growing natural
resource consumption and emergency requirement of environmental protection.1,2 Therefore, green and sustainable energy storage systems have become
a research hot spot.3−8 Fortunately, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have been successfully
used in most mobile systems owing to their merits of high energy density,
environmental friendliness, and long cyclic stability. In fact, anode
materials largely affect the electrochemical performance of LIBs.
Although graphite has been widely used as a commercially available
anode material, it still possesses a low theoretical capacity of 372
mA h g–1 and a poor rate capacity, which cannot
satisfy the demand for high-power and high-energy density LIBs. As
alternatives, various types of anode materials with novel structures
and properties have been developed, such as silicon/carbon composites,9 metallic oxides,10,11 metallic sulfides,12,13 metal alloys,14 carbonaceous materials,
and their composite materials.15,16 Among these, carbon-based
materials have been widely deliberated from natural products to 
organic synthesis, such as biomass precursors and organic materials,
etc.17 Especially, carbon materials with
a porous structure and doped with heteroatoms have attracted extensive
attention in energy storage system because of their merits of reproducible
nature, low price, and wide availability of raw materials.18 Lithium-ion diffusion can be promoted by the
shortening of length benefited from the porous structure. Meanwhile,
the doping heteroatoms could enhance the electronic conductivity by
enriching the defects for electric transport.

So far, conjugated
porous polymers (CPPs) have presented versatile
applications in the fields of heterogeneous catalysis, energy storage,
gas separation, and hydrogen storage.19−22 These porous materials with high
surface area and rich intrinsic porosity are able to provide adequate
interfaces for function. A highly stable structure and synthetic diversity
render them ideal alternatives to other materials. In addition, the
unique π-conjugated frameworks endow these polymers with certain
degrees of electron-transition capacity.23 Therefore, this type of materials presents great potentials in energy
storage application. Several works on CPPs as electrode materials
of high-performance LIBs have been reported recently.24−29 BODIPY-based CPPs have risen as a novel type of porous material
and shown efficient heterogeneous photocatalytic activity, gas separation,
and iodine capture capability in recent years.30−32 Apart from
rich porosity and excellent physicochemical stability, similar to
other CPPs, the polymer backbone is doped with heteroatoms such as
boron (B), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F) because of the incorporation
of the BODIPY moiety. The application of BODIPY-based CPPs in energy
storage fields just stays at the early stage. We envisage whether
BODIPY-based CPPs can be served as electrode materials in the energy
storage system. However, raw CPPs as electrode materials in LIBs normally
suffer relatively low capacity, which limits their further application.24,26,29 As is well known, the carbonization
strategy is a typical and efficient postmodification method to create
novel functional materials. The resulting carbonized material might
exhibit some advantages such as rich defects, better conductivity,
and controllable porous structure.33−35 Recent reports demonstrate
the potential application of porous carbon that stemmed from CPPs
in the energy storage aspect.36−38 In this way, we aim to investigate
and compare the electrochemical property of BODIPY-based CPPs before
and after the carbonization process as electrode materials in an LIB
system.

To address the abovementioned consideration, a novel
conjugated
porous polymer CPP-1 is derived from the BODIPY derivative BDP-1 and
1,3,5-triethynylbenzene (TEB) by Sonogashira coupling reaction. Following
this, a conventional carbonization procedure on CPP-1 is performed,
and the resulting product CPP-1-C is obtained as dark brown powder.
Given the high surface area and permanent nanopores, both CPP-1 and
CPP-1-C can provide massive sites for the intercalation of lithium
ions. In this way, CPP-1 and CPP-1-C are exploited as anode materials
in LIBs. As for CPP-1, long-term cyclic performances at 0.1 and 1
A g–1 are achieved with maintaining the specific
capacity at 273.2 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles at 0.1
A g–1 and 250.8 mA h g–1 after
300 cycles at 1 A g–1. The carbonized sample exhibits
a better electrochemical performance with a reversible specific capacity
of 675 mA h g–1 at 0.2 A g–1.
Moreover, the capacity is still stabilized at 437 mA h g–1 after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g–1.

Results and Discussion
Structure
and Morphology Analysis
The resulting product
was prepared according to the synthesis routes (Scheme 1). Details about the synthesis processes
and characterization data are described in the Experimental
Section. The solid-state 13CP/magic angle spinning (MAS) NMR
spectrum was recorded to investigate the molecular structure of the
obtained CPP-1 (Figure S1). The wide band
between 150 and 110 ppm at the aromatic region might be attributed
to the extended conjugated framework of the polymer, whereas the peaks
at 40 and 15 ppm might be generated from the methyl groups of the
BODIPY units.30−32 X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is employed
to characterize the structural information of the as-prepared CPP-1
and CPP-1-C. In the detailed B 1s curve (Figure 1a), peaks centered at 190.5 and 192.7 eV
are observed, which are assigned to B–N and B–F bonds,
respectively.39,40 While the simulation of high-resolution
C 1s peak reveals the interaction of C–C/C=C bond around
284.4 eV and that of C–N bond centered at 286.3 eV (Figure 1b).41,42 In the N 1s spectra (Figure 1c), two distinct peaks around 398.0 and 399.8 eV are present,
which are attributed to the interaction of B–N and C–N,43−45 respectively. The F 1s spectra reveal two potential components around
686.4 and 685.6 eV, which are assigned to two separate B–F
bonds (Figure 1d).46 Therefore, the specific chemical bonds in the
monomers BDP-1 and TEB have been transferred to polymer successfully,
from the XPS results. As for the high-resolution XPS spectra of CPP-1-C,
B–N, C–C/C=C, and C–N are observed as
well, which is similar to CPP-1. The detected O–C=O
peak around 289.0 eV can be attributed to the absorption of CO2 in the air among the nanopores. We speculate that the obtained
CPP-1-C could behave as a platform for CO2 uptake so that
a limited amount of CO2 can be detected by XPS characterization.
However, the F 1s spectrum is too weak to be detected after carbonization
from the XPS spectra, indicating that F is mostly decomposed. The
elemental analysis result (Table S1) demonstrates
that the contents of B and N in the resultant carbon material are
1.04 and 3.56%, respectively. Therefore, it is proved that the obtained
porous materials suffer from B- and N-doping defects, which can further
enhance the electronic conductivity of the material.47,48

(a–d) and CPP-1-C (e–h).

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of CPP-1 and CPP-1-C
The polymerization is further confirmed by the Fourier
transform
infrared (FT-IR) spectrum (Figure 2). First, the corresponding peak located at 2201 cm–1 is ascribed to the C≡C vibration arisen after
polymerization, whereas the terminal ≡C–H stretching
vibration at 3270 cm–1 disappears. Second, the appearances
of obvious peaks at 1630 and 2970 cm–1 are, respectively,
assigned to the C–N and C–H vibrations from the BODIPY
moiety, revealing that the polymerization is successful.30,32 However, the carbonized product CPP-1-C exhibits few broad vibration
peaks, and the corresponding characteristic peaks of CPP-1 vanish.
This result might be ascribed to high carbonization of the CPP-1 accompanied
by the break of covalent bonds and the collapse of frameworks in the
polymer during the pyrolyzation process.33,34

Figure 2 FT-IR
spectra of monomers, CPP-1, and CPP-1-C.

In order to elaborate the morphologies of the obtained samples,
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) experiments are performed. As shown in Figure 3a,d, CPP-1 and CPP-1-C display a similar
honeycomb-like morphology composed of sphere-shaped nanoparticles.
Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) mappings of CPP-1 (Figure 3b1–b4) demonstrate that
boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and fluorine (F) are well distributed
in the substrate. However, as shown in Figure 3e1–e4, fluorine (F) almost disappeared
after the heat treatment, which is consistent with Feng’s observation.49 The rich porous characteristic is further verified
by TEM investigation. The images reveal uniform alternately dark and
bright wormlike porous microstructures (Figure 3c,f). High-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM) indicates that both CPP-1 and CPP-1-C are amorphous
materials, which agreed well with the X-ray diffraction (XRD) results
(Figure S2).

and CPP-1-C. (a–c) SEM, EDS mapping,
and TEM images of CPP-1 and (d–f) SEM, EDS mapping, and TEM
images of CPP-1-C.

Nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherm experiments at 77
K were employed to further investigate the porous properties. As demonstrated
in Figure 4a, both
CPP-1 and CPP-1-C possess reversible sorption profiles. A rapid uptake
at a low relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.05) reveals the existence of microporous architectures.30,32 Moreover, the hysteresis in the high pressure region is attributed
to the mesoporous structure. Indeed, both micropores and mesopores
are available from the pore size distribution results (Figure 4b). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of CPP-1 is calculated to be 502 m2 g–1, whereas CPP-1-C shows a higher surface area of 683
m2 g–1. The average pore sizes of CPP-1
and CPP-1-C are determined to be 20.5 and 6.9 nm, respectively. The
shrinkage of the average pore size after the pyrolyzation process
may be attributed to the collapse of the relatively thermolabile parts
of polymer frameworks under high temperatures.33,34 Hence, the hierarchical porous architectures with a high specific
surface area of the two samples are confirmed. Such porous structures
are beneficial to ion transportation by shortening the diffusion distance.

distribution patterns (b) of CPP-1 and CPP-1-C.

Electrochemical Property of CPP-1
Figure 5a shows the cyclic voltammetry
(CV) curve of CPP-1, in which the irreversible peak can be detected
around 0.7 V at the first cycle and vanished in the following cycles,
which is associated with the formation of a solid electrolyte interface
resulting from the decomposition of electrolyte during the initial
discharge process. In addition,
the long plateau below 0.2 V was attributed to the lithiation process
of carbonaceous materials. The charge–discharge profiles at
different cycles are displayed in Figure 5b, manifesting its superior cyclic stability
with a retention of 85% after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–1. The relatively low initial Coulombic efficiency is due to the high
specific surface area and the formation of LiF.50 As for the EIS result, the values of Re, Rf + Rct, and Wo are 10.0, 36.5,
and 7.9 Ω, respectively, which are in favor of lithium-ion transport
in electrolyte. We demonstrate the electrochemical performance at
different current densities from 0.05 to 5 A g–1 in Figure 5c as well.
To our delight, the sample shows a specific capacity of 138.8 mA h
g–1 even at 5 A g–1, and the value
remains at 262.6 mA h g–1 when the current goes
back to 0.1 A g–1. As illustrated in Figure 5d,e, long-term cyclic performances
at 0.1 and 1 A g–1 are achieved with maintaining
the specific capacity of CPP-1 at 273.2 mA h g–1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g–1 and 250.8 mA h g–1 after 300 cycles at 1 A g–1. The
heteroatom doping of CPPs with superior rate performance and long-term
cyclic stability can be a promising way when it comes to LIB anodes.

performance of CPP-1. (a) CV curve, (b) charge–discharge
profiles at different cycles (the inset shows THE EIS fitting result),
(c) rate property, and (d–e) cyclic performance at 0.1 and
1 A g–1.

Electrochemical Property of CPP-1-C
To evaluate the
anode property in LIBs comprehensively, the electrochemical properties
of the as-prepared carbonized sample (CPP-1-C) are also investigated.
A similar CV curve with CPP-1 can be found in Figure 6a. The discharge–charge profiles in
the first three cycles at 50 mA g–1 are shown in Figure 6b, which experience
a short plateau centered at 0.7 V and a long plateau below 0.2 V.
This result is consistent with the CV profiles. In addition, the initial
discharge and charge capacities are as high as 1675 and 933 mA h g–1, respectively. As a result, the initial Columbic
efficiency (ICE) is 55.7%. It is worth mentioning that the ICE is
highly correlated with the formation of SEI on the porous electrode.
After the initial cycle, the charge–discharge curves show good
repeatability, delivering charge specific capacities of 910 and 885
mA h g–1 at the second and third cycles, respectively.
The high capacity can be attributed to the fact that the heteroatoms
inside the CPP-1-C skeleton can act as redox-active units, providing
abundant energy storing modules. The rate performance in Figure 6c demonstrates that
the as-prepared sample shows great advantages with high specific capacity
and cyclic ability even at high rates. It can still maintain a reversible
capacity of 222 mA h g–1 at 5 A g–1. Moreover, when the current recovers back to 0.1 A g–1, the specific capacity is able to return to 580 mA h g–1, which indicates that the prepared sample shows good ability to
bear the artificial change of current density in a wide range.

tests of CPP-1-C. (a) CV profiles at 0.1 mV s–1 for
the initial three cycles. (b) Charge–discharge
curves at the current of 0.05 A g–1 for the first
three cycles. (c) Rate performance of the sample from 0.05 to 5 A
g–1. (d) Cyclic stability at 0.2 A g–1 for 200 cycles. (e). Cyclic stability at 0.5 A g–1 for 500 cycles.

The cyclic performance
of CPP-1-C at 0.2 A g–1 is displayed in Figure 6d. It can be seen
that the sample delivers excellent cyclic
stability even after 200 cycles. Particularly, the capacity decreases
from 675 to 521 mA h g–1 in the first 50 cycles
and remains stable in the following cycles. The capacity decay during
the first 50 cycles might be attributed to the high specific area
and porous character, which leads to the difficulty in forming a stabilized
SEI film. After 200 cycles, the specific capacity remained at 517
mA h g–1. An average capacity decay ratio from 50
to 200 cycles can be calculated to be 0.025 mA h g–1 per cycle. Even after 500 cycles at 0.5 A g–1 (Figure 6e), the charge capacity
remained at 436 mA h g–1 with a retention of 68%.
Note that the profile shows the same trend as that at 0.2 A g–1, showing a decay at first decades (from 641 to 490
mA h g–1 in the first 25 cycles), followed by a
stable level (from 490 to 436 mA h g–1 in the last
475 cycles). In addition, the cyclic performance at 0.5 A g–1 for 300 cycles after rate test (Figure S3) and long-term cyclic properties (Figure S4) further confirm the unique electrochemical performance of the prepared
material. After cycling, the integrity of the pole piece can be maintained
(Figure S5). The superior long-term cyclic
stability and high rate performance are benefited from the stable
porous characteristic of the prepared sample, which facilitates lithium-ion
transportation and storage. In addition, the N, B heteroatom doping
enhances the conductivity of the sample, which can promote the electron
transport especially at high rate. As a result, the rate capability
can be improved.

Conclusions
In summary, BODIPY-incorporated
CPP-1 has been successfully prepared
and thoroughly characterized. The N, B codoped carbon material CPP-1-C
was realized from the abovementioned CPP-1 via a direct carbonization
process. The as-prepared CPP-1 and CPP-1-C show excellent porous property
with high surface area, which promoted the transportation and storage
of lithium ions. Besides, the heteroatoms can behave as redox-active
units that provide abundant energy storing modules. As a result, the
assembled LIBs composed of the CPP-1 anode material exhibit high lithium-ion
storage property, including high specific capacity, outstanding cycle
stability, and superior rate performance, which is comparable to the
reported state-of-the-art CPPs. In addition, obvious enhancement of
electrochemical performance was detected after the carbonization treatment,
which may arise from the better conductivity and structural stability
of CPP-1-C. From these results, we believe that the CPPs can serve
as promising candidates for the next-generation energy storage devices.
Further work on this aspect to design functional CPP-based electrode
materials is ongoing in our laboratory.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemical reagents are obtained from the
commercial suppliers and used without further purification unless
otherwise stated. All reactions are carried out in three-neck flasks
under the protection of N2. N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) and trimethylamine (TEA) are dried
by refluxing in the presence of calcium hydroxide. Analytical thin-layer
chromatography is employed to determine the reaction process. Column
chromatography is applied to purify the crude products with silica
gel (200–300 mesh) as the stationary phases. Deionized water
is obtained from an ultrapure water system, HITECH Smart-S15.

Instruments
1H NMR and 13C NMR
experiments are performed on the Bruker Avance spectrometer at 400
and 100 MHz at 298 K, respectively. Solid-state cross-polarization
MAS (13C CP/MAS NMR) spectra are obtained from the Bruker Avance III
400 MHz spectrometer. All chemical shifts are reported in parts per
million (ppm) by using tetramethylsilane as an internal reference.
High-resolution mass spectra were recorded on the Bruker Daltonics
Apex IV spectrometer. XRD (Rigaku, Rint-2000) is employed to characterize
the structural evolution before and after the heat treatment from
10 to 40° at a scanning rate of 10° min–1. SEM images and EDS measurements are carried out with a JSM 6390LV
microscope. A JEOL JEM-2100F microscope is exploited to obtain the
HR-TEM images. FT-IR spectra are collected on a Nicolet 6700 FT-IR
(scimitar series) spectrometer in the 500–4000 cm–1 region. The cumulative apparent surface areas for N2 are
calculated on Micro ASAP 2020 using the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) model range from 0.01 to 0.1 bar for all samples. Microporous
volumes are calculated using the t-plot method, and
the total porous volumes are obtained from the N2 isotherm
at P/P0 = 0.99. Pore
size distributions are derived from the N2 adsorption isotherms
using density functional theory methods. All samples followed typical
pretreatment procedures to be degassed at 120 °C for 8 h before
the measurements. XPS spectra are recorded on an ESCALAB 250Xi.

Synthesis of Compound 1
The synthesis of compound 1
was according to the literature.511H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.57 (s, 1H), 8.03
(d, J = 8.4 Hz, 2H), 7.91 (d, J =
8.8 Hz, 2H), 7.47 (m, 4H), 5.89 (s, 2H), 2.63 (s, 6H), 0.65 (s, 6H).

Synthesis of BDP-1
Compound 1 (200 mg, 0.47 mmol) and
an excess amount of iodine (1.0 g, 3.9 mmol) were dissolved in anhydrous
tetrahydrofuran (100 mL). Aqueous solution (2 mL) of iodic acid (350
mg, 2 mmol) was added dropwise into the mixture in 0.5 h. The reaction
was carried out at 25 °C for 4 h. After that, the solvent was
removed under reduced pressure. The crude product was washed with
water, and the organic portion was dried over MgSO4. Then,
the precipitate was filtered, and the organic solvent was evaporated.
The residue was purified by silica gel chromatography with DCM/PE
(4:1, v/v) as eluents to afford BDP-1 as a red brown solid (270 mg,
85%). 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3): δ 8.62
(s, 1H), 8.06 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, 2H), 7.81 (d, J = 8.6 Hz, 2H), 7.51 (t, J = 7.6 Hz, 2H),

Synthesis of CPP-1
BDP-1 (300 mg, 0.44 mmol) and TEB
(67 mg, 0.44 mmol) were dissolved in an anhydrous mixture solvent
(DMF/TEA = 1:1, 8.0 mL). The mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles to remove the residual oxygen, and then Pd(PPh3)4 (25 mg, 0.016 mmol) and CuI (7.0 mg, 0.04 mmol) were added
successively into the mixture. The mixture was degassed by three freeze–pump–thaw
cycles again, and then the solution was heated to 100 °C and
kept stirring for 96 h under a N2 atmosphere. After the
mixture was cooled down to room temperature, the resulting precipitate
was collected by filtration. The crude product was washed with chloroform,
acetone, and dichloromethane. Soxhlet extraction was employed to further
remove the impurities by washing with acetone, tetrahydrofuran, chloroform,
methanol, and water for 24 h. The resulting brown solid was freeze-dried
for 5 days to afford dark brown powder (240 mg, 94%).

Preparation
of CPP-1-C
The resulting CPP-1 was added
to a tube furnace, which was then heated to 700 °C and held for
3 h under an Ar atmosphere at a heating rate of 5 °C min–1. After cooling down to ambient temperature, the residue
CPP-1-C was collected as black powder and employed as electrode materials.
The elaborate synthesis route is shown in Scheme 1.

Electrochemical Measurements
As
a typical route, the
working electrodes were prepared by mixing CPP-1 or CPP-1-C (80%)
as active materials, super P (10%) as a conductive agent, and poly(vinylidene
fluoride) (10%) as a binder to make slurry with the addition of N-methyl pyrrolidinone. The slurry was stirred for 0.5 h,
then uniformly pasted onto a Cu foil, and dried in an oven at 120
°C for 12 h. The loading mass of the electrode materials was
controlled at 0.7–0.9 mg cm–2. The CR2025
coin-type cells were assembled in a glove box filled with Ar. Lithium
metal and Celgard 2500 were employed as a counter electrode and a
separator, respectively, while 1 M LiPF6 in EC/DEC/DMC (1:1:1 in v/v/v)
was exploited as an electrolyte. Then, the as-prepared cells were
laid aside for at least 8 h and tested on a Neware battery test system
within the voltage range of 0.01–3.0 V at different current
densities. CV experiments were carried out with a CHI660d electrochemical
work station.
