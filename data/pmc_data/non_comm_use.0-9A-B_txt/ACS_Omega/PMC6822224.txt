A novel
fluorescent probe, amino-pillar[5]arene (APA), was prepared
via a green, effective, and convenient synthetic method, which was
characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), infrared (IR),
and high-resolution mass spectrometry. The fluorescence sensing behavior
of the APA probe toward 22 metal ions in aqueous solutions were studied
by fluorescence spectroscopy. The results showed that APA could be
used as a selective fluorescent probe for the specificity detection
of Au3+ ions. Moreover, the detection characteristics were
investigated by fluorescence spectral titration, pH effect, fluorescence
competitive experiments, Job’s plot analysis, 1H
NMR, and IR. The results indicated that detection of Au3+ ions by the APA probe could be achieved in the range of pH 1–13.5
and that other coexisting metal ions did not cause any marked interference.
The titration analysis results indicated that the fluorescence intensity
decreased as the concentration of Au3+ ions increased,
with an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.9942).
The detection limit was as low as 7.59 × 10–8 mol·L–1, and the binding ratio of the APA
probe with Au3+ ions was 2:1. Therefore, the APA probe
has potential applications for detecting Au3+ ions in the
environment and in living organisms.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Au3+ ions, a notable heavy metal, have received great
attention in chemistry and biology during recent decades and have
been widely used in gold plating,1 environmental
studies,2 anticancer agents,3 nanomaterials, efficient catalysts, biological
sensors, and drug/gene delivery systems based on their unique chemical
properties and high biocompatibility.4−7 In addition, these ions have also been developed
for application in the jewelry industry.8 Studies have shown that Au3+ ions can be used to prepare
reduced graphene oxide/Au nanoparticles (NPs), drugs, and catalysts
to detect dopamine, ascorbic acid, and uric acid; to treat tuberculosis
and rheumatoid arthritis; and to activate carbon–carbon triple
bonds.9−11 Although Au3+ ions have versatile roles
in materials science and biological systems, studies have demonstrated
that Au3+ ion-based drugs exhibit potential toxicity at
certain concentrations.12 Alternatively,
the Au3+ ions may be broken down and cause damage to the
liver, kidney, and nervous system when bound to proteins and DNA.13,14 Therefore, it was essential to explore a fast, operationally simple,
and capable method to detect metabolic processes in living organisms,
in view of the medically, physiologically, and environmentally important
research value of gold derivatives.

Recently, fluorescent probes
are the most effective methods in
the field of ion detection because of their instant response,15 operational simplicity,16,17 and high sensitivity.18−20 In recent years, the synthesis
of macrocyclic compounds and their functionalization for applications
in fluorescent probes have attracted the interest of many researchers.
Pillararene was the only highly symmetrical tubular molecule found
after the investigation of other macrocyclic molecules, such as crown
ethers, cyclodextrin, calixarene, and cucurbituril21 and has been widely applied in biology,22 drug delivery,23 separation
process,24 functional materials,25,26 and the environment since 2008 owing to its unique rigid structural
characteristics and good host–guest recognition performance.27,28 To date, many researchers have successfully applied pillararenes
to ion detection.29−31 For example, Huang’s research group reported
a fluorescent chemosensor anthracene-appended 2:3 copillar[5]arene
to detect Fe3+.32 Yuan and Feng
et al. reported a nonsymmetric pillar[5]arene bearing triazole-linked
8-oxyquinolines, which was applied as a sequential fluorescence sensor
for thorium(IV) followed by fluoride ions with high sensitivity and
selectivity.33 Xia and Wang et al. developed
a host–guest system between pillar[5]arene and a rhodamine
B-containing amphiphile as a Cu(II) ion sensor in aqueous media.34 In addition, the Stoddart et al. has reported
gold recovery from gold-bearing raw materials by α-cyclodextrin.35

In this paper, we synthesized a novel
fluorescent probe, amino-pillar[5]arene
(APA), bearing water-soluble amino groups. The amino groups were successfully
modified on the pillar[5]arene via aminolysis using ethylenediamine
as both a reactant and a solvent. Subsequently, the application of
APA in Au3+ ion detection with 22 metal ion species was
studied. Moreover, pH effect analysis, fluorescence spectral titration,
Job’s plot analysis, 1H NMR, and fluorescence competitive
experiments were carried out. To the best of our knowledge, no reports
concerning APA as a fluorescent probe for detecting Au3+ ions have been found in the literature. Therefore, the primary aim
of this work was to synthesize a novel fluorescence probe, APA, which
had potential for application in the detection of Au3+ ions
in the environment and living organisms.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 APA Fluorescence Performance
Measurement
The APA probe showed yellow-white fluorescence
(Figure 1a) under a
UV lamp at 365 nm,
as observed by the naked eye, and a sharp peak (Figure 1b) was detected at 323 nm in the fluorescence
spectrum of aqueous APA. The experimental results and pictures show
that APA can not only produce yellow-white light in solid form but
also detect a strong fluorescence peak in aqueous solution. Although the emission peak of the APA
aqueous solution was in the UV emission range and difference from
the solid-state luminescence performance, due to the luminescent properties
of substance were not only related to itself and form. Moreover, different
solvents also affect the luminescence properties. Therefore, the luminescent
properties of the substances in different forms were independent of
each other.36,37 Therefore, APA could be used
as a fluorescence probe to study the recognition of the host–guest
system of metal ions.

nm and (b)

2.2 Detection of Metal Ions
The fluorescence
spectra (Figure 2)
showed an obvious decrease in fluorescence intensity from 703 to 20
au after adding 3 equiv of Au3+, but other metal ions did
not show major changes. The results showed that the APA probe had
high selectivity for Au3+ ions in aqueous solution and
could thus be used as a fluorescence probe to detect Au3+ ions.

upon addition of 3 equiv of Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Bi+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co3+, Cs+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, Li+, Mg2+, Na+, Pb2+, Sb2+, Sn2+, Sr2+, Ni2+, and Au3+ (λex = 323 nm).

2.3 Fluorescence
Spectral Titration
To
further study the interaction between Au3+ ions and APA,
fluorescence spectral titration experiments were carried out. A series
of APA (2 × 10–5 mol·L–1) and Au3+ ion solutions were prepared. The concentrations
of Au3+ ions ranged from 0 to 6 equiv (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6,
0.8, 1.0, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.8, 2.0, 2.2, 2.4, 2.6, 2.8, and 3.0). The
fluorescence spectrum measurement method was the same as described
in Section 4.3.1. The results are shown in Figure 3. The fluorescence intensity gradually decreased with
increasing concentrations of Au3+ ions, and the APA fluorescence
was almost completely quenched when 4 equiv of Au3+ ions
was added. Furthermore, there was a good linear curve fitting between
the fluorescence intensity and Au3+ ion concentration over
a range of concentrations. As shown in Figure 3b, the linear equation was y = 659.93 – 209.40X, R2 = 0.99365.

Figure 3 (a) Fluorescence spectra of the APA probe in the presence
of different
concentrations of Au3+ ions and (b) linear fitting curve
of the APA probe with increasing concentrations of Au3+ ions.

The lowest detection limit was
calculated by the following formula 1  LOD (mol·L–1): detection
limit. δ (mol·L–1): standard deviation
of 10 blank measurements. S = 209.40: the slope of
a linear fitting curve from fluorescence spectral titration experiments. 2  

The lowest detection
limit obtained from formula 1 was 7.59 ×
10–8 mol·L–1.38,39 The results showed that the APA probe had
a high sensitivity to detect Au3+ ions and that APA could
be used as a fluorescence probe to detect Au3+ ions quantitatively
in aqueous solution.

2.4 Job’s Plot
The stoichiometry
of APA and Au3+ ions was determined by the Job method.40−43 The total molar concentrations of APA and Au3+ ions were
maintained at 2 × 10–5 mol·L–1 in aqueous solution. The molar fraction of Au3+ ions
([Au3+]/([Au3+] + [A])) varied from 0 to 1.0.
Then, the fluorescence intensity was recorded at 323 nm by a fluorescence
spectrometer at room temperature. A Job plot (Figure 4a) was generated by taking the molar fraction
of Au3+ ions as the X-coordinate and the
fluorescence intensity multiplied by the molar fraction as the Y-coordinate. The binding stoichiometry of the APA probe
with Au3+ ions was determined from the highest point of
the Job plot. If the highest point of the Job plot corresponds to
the X-coordinates of 0.33, 0.5, and 0.67, the binding
stoichiometries of the APA probe with Au3+ ions were 2:1,
1:1, and 1:2, respectively. It can be seen from Figure 4a that the highest point corresponding to
the X-coordinate was 0.33, from which it could be
inferred that the binding ratio of APA to Au3+ ion was
2:1.

Figure 4 (a) Job’s plot for the APA probe and Au3+ ion
system ([APA] + (Au3+) = 2 × 10–5 mol·L–1) at 323 nm in aqueous solution; (b)
fluorescence spectra of the APA probe in the presence of Au3+ ions ([APA] + (Au3+) = 2×10–5 mol·L–1).

2.5 pH Effect
Studies
In general, pH
was also a significant factor affecting ion fluorescence, which determined
the sensitivity of detecting ions. In this work, the pH effect was
investigated by adding Au3+ ion (2 equiv) to the solution
of APA probe (2 × 10–5 mol·L–1). The pH range of 1–13.5 was regulated by using 0.1 mol·L–1 HCl and 0.1 mol·L–1 NaOH.
The APA fluorescence intensity increased as the pH increased (Figure 5). In a strong acid
environment, the fluorescence intensity of APA was relatively weak,
which could be explained by protonation of the amino group. The APA
fluorescence was relatively strong in neutral and alkaline environments,
and the maximum intensity was 744.356 au. Minor changes were observed
in the pH range of 1–13.5 when the Au3+ ion solution
was added, which indicated that the APA fluorescent probe was not
significantly affected by the detection of Au3+ ions in
this pH range. APA showed very stable fluorescence characteristics
in the pH range of 1–13.5. Therefore, this fluorescent probe
could be used for detecting Au3+ ions in subsequent research
in acidic, neutral, and alkaline environments.

intensity and Au3+ ion
detection.

2.6 Competition
with Other Metal Ions
For a good fluorescent probe, the most
important factor is that the
detected ions are not affected by the addition of competitive ions.
In this research, the detectability of Au3+ ions by APA
was evaluated by fluorescence competitive experiments, which were
carried out by adding Au3+ ions (2 equiv) to the APA (2
× 10–5 mol·L–1) solution
with Ag+, Al3+, Ba2+, Bi+, Ca2+, Cd2+, Co3+, Cs+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Hg2+, K+, Li+, Mg2+, Na+,
Pb2+, Sb2+, Sn2+, Sr2+, and Ni2+ (2 equiv) cations and Br–, I–, PO43–, HPO42–, Cl–, HSO3–, CO32–, HCO3–, SO42–, NO3–, NO2–, and
F– (2 equiv) anions, the results are shown in Figure 6. It was found that
other coexisting metal ions did not cause any marked interference.
Therefore, APA had good selectivity for the detection of Au3+ ions.

Ni2+). (b) Fluorescence intensity of the fluorescent probe

anions (Br–, I–, PO43–, HPO42–, Cl–, HSO3–, CO32–, HCO3–, SO42–, NO3–, NO2–, and F–).

2.7 1H NMR and infrared Spectra
To confirm the binding mode and mechanism of the fluorescent probe
APA with Au3+ ions, the 1H NMR spectra of APA
and different equivalents of Au3+ ions were measured in
D2O. Figure 7 showed that the obvious gradually disappeared APA peaks at 6.89
ppm (1), 4.54 ppm (3), and 3.88 ppm (5) when the concentration of
Au3+ ions increased. Meanwhile, the obvious low-field shifts
of APA peaks at 3.16 ppm (6) and 2.80 ppm (7) after addition of Au3+ ions. However, there were no significant changes at other
peaks. Therefore, it inferred that the interaction between Au3+ ions with
N signal peak (5) of APA, and at signals peaks 1, 2, and 3 disappearance
of APA due to the electron cloud was shielded, which demonstrated
again that APA and Au3+ ions formed a complex compound.

Figure 7 1H NMR spectra at (a) APA concentration of 2 ×
10–3 mol·L–1; (b) APA concentration
of 2 × 10–3 mol·L–1 with
2 equiv of Au3+ ions; (c) and APA concentration of 2 ×
10–3 mol·L–1 with 5 equiv
of Au3+ ions (D2O as solvent).

To further infer the binding mode and mechanism of the fluorescent
probe APA and Au3+ ions, the infrared (IR) spectra of APA
and complex compound were measured. The result is shown in Figure 8a; by comparing the
IR spectra of APA with the complex, it can be clearly observed from Figure 8a that the peak intensity
and peak shape at 3400 (N), 1650 (C=O), and 1150 (C–O–C)
all have changed after Au3+ was complexed with APA. However,
there was no significant change in the peak position corresponding
to the benzene ring (1600, 1580, and 1500). Therefore, it can be inferred
that Au3+ interacted with the N branch of the APA and without
interacting with the benzene ring. On the basis of the findings of
the above results, we inferred that the binding mode of APA with the
Au3+ ions was shown in Figure 8b.

and (b) binding
mode of APA and Au3+ ions.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the fluorescent probe
APA was successfully synthesized
and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), IR, and high-resolution
mass spectrometry (HRMS). Fluorescence spectroscopy showed that APA
can be used as a probe to detect Au3+ ions. APA exhibited
stable fluorescence characteristics in the pH range of 1–13.5,
and other coexisting ions did not cause any marked interference. The
binding mode was further confirmed by Job’s plot analysis, 1H NMR, and IR, showing that the binding ratio of APA to Au3+ ions was 2:1. Therefore, the fluorescent probe APA may open
new prospects for the design and metabolism of gold-based drugs in
living organisms.

applied in the substitution reaction with methyl chloroacetate to
achieve compound D. Finally, the desired product E was obtained via amidation of compound D with
ethylenediamine.
