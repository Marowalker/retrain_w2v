A free-standing flexible anode material
for sodium storage with
sandwich-structured characteristics was fabricated by modified vacuum
filtration, consisting of stacked layers of Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@carbon nanotubes (NTO NW@CNT) and graphene
oxide. The NTO NWs have a larger specific surface area for Na+ insertion/extraction with shortened ion diffusion pathways,
accelerating the charge transfer/collection kinetics. The added CNTs
both facilitate the uniform dispersion of the nanowires and nanotubes
and also contribute to the connectivity of the nanowires, improving
their conductivity. More importantly, the unique sandwichlike layered-structured
film not only provides large numbers of electron-transfer channels
and promotes the reaction kinetics during the charging and discharging
process but also ensures the structural stability of the NTO NWs and
the electrode. Electrochemical measurements suggest that this rationally
designed structure endows the electrode with a high specific capacity
and excellent cycling performance. A satisfactory reversible capacity
as high as 92.5 mA h g–1 was achieved after 100
cycles at 2C; subsequently, the electrode also delivered 59.9 mA h
g–1 after a further 100 cycles at 5C. Furthermore,
after the rate performance test, the electrode could be continuously
cycled for 100 cycles at a current density of 0.2C, which demonstrated
that durable cyclic capacity with a high reversible capacity of 114.1
mA h g–1 was retained. This novel and low-cost fabrication
procedure is readily scalable and provides a promising avenue for
potential industrial applications.

Introduction
In modern society,
portable and wearable electronics, such as flexible
sensors and hand-held displays, are highly desired, which has motivated
research into the necessary lightweight and flexible high-performance
power sources.1−3 At present, the study of flexible power sources is
mainly focused on lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)4−6 and supercapacitors
(SCs). In the energy-storage field, great attention has been focused
on flexible SCs because of their convenient processability, fast charging
and discharging ability, excellent rate capability, and their superior
cycle lifetime.7−9 However, the energy density of SCs is not very high
considering the need for long-term resilience, and thus flexible LIBs
perhaps hold greater promise for smart electronics, rollup displays,
wearable devices, and other applications.10−12 Flexible LIBs
are of particular interest due to their higher energy storage densities.
However, at present, with the commercialization of electric vehicles
powered by LIBs, the limited availability of lithium storage will
progressively increase its cost. As a result, low-cost sodium ion
batteries (SIBs) have become a very popular topic in the research
field of energy storage and conversion devices.

Sodium ion batteries
have attracted interesting attention because
they have similar electrochemical properties to LIBs in addition to
their low cost and environmental friendliness.13,14 However, flexible SIBs are still rarely reported at present. It
is well-known that characteristics of batteries, such as flexibility,
specific capacity, and rate capability, are mainly determined by their
electrode materials.15 Therefore, it is
highly desirable to search for suitable electrode materials with appropriate
flexibility for use in SIBs. Actually, some endeavors have been made
to study flexible electrode materials for flexible SIBs, such as MoS2,16,17 Sb,18 and Li4Ti5O12.19 Among the various anode materials, Na2Ti3O7 (NTO) has been most promising on account of its high specific
capacity (177 mA h g–1) and its low charging/discharging
voltage plateau of 0.3 V versus Na/Na+.20 Nevertheless, the structural instability and the low electronic
conductivity of Na2Ti3O7 limit its
further practical application. To solve these problems, lots of efforts
have been made to design and fabricate Na2Ti3O7 nanostructures, including nanorods, nanoparticles,
microspheres, nanotubes, and nanocomposites with carbon.21−26 However, the design and fabrication of reliable flexible electrodes
with high storage capacity, high rate capability, and excellent stability
remain challenging.

For the fabrication of SIB electrodes, conventional
methods usually
involve mixing, casting, and pressing the mixed compounds. These compounds
comprise a cathode or an anode material for sodium storage, the metal
current collectors, a conductive agent to maintain the electrode conductivity
onto the metal current collectors, and a binder to inhibit the shedding
of the active materials from metal current collectors.27−29 Such electrodes usually have little flexibility due to their rigid
structure. Moreover, they contain a significant amount of inert components
(e.g., binders) and cumbersome current collectors are used in the
electrodes, inevitably compromising the energy density of the devices.
Lightweight flexible substrates, such as textiles30 or plastics,31 have been proposed
as replacements for metal substrates. To address sluggish Na reaction
kinetics, Li et al. first designed the surface-engineered Na2Ti3O7 nanoarrays on flexible Ti substrates
by using the atomic layer deposition and hydrogenation process, through
which the Na-ion batteries demonstrated the high-rate and long-cycled
operation.32,33 Zhang et al. reported that NTO
nanosheet array/carbon textiles exhibited excellent performance when
used as the anode materials of sodium-ion pseudocapacitors.34 Our previous work also showed that ultralong
NTO nanowires@carbon cloth as a binder-free flexible electrode demonstrated
a large capacity and long lifetime for sodium-ion batteries.35 However, the preparation of these flexible electrodes
usually requires a substrate, such as carbon cloth, carbon paper,
etc., and they are difficult to develop for large-scale production.
In addition, the loading mass of the active material in these flexible
electrodes is limited and difficult to control.

Herein, by introducing
an architectural design strategy, a hybrid
free-standing and sandwich-structured electrode was developed, which
is a combination of one-dimensional nanowires together with nanotubes
and two-dimensional graphene sheets in hierarchically structured composites.
In this work, we demonstrate a simple method of hydrothermal-assisted
vacuum filtration to prepare Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT@reduced graphene oxide (NTO NW@CNT@rGO) sandwich-structured
flexible film electrodes for flexible SIBs for the first time. The
unique sandwich-structured NTO NW@CNT@rGO flexible electrode materials
were prepared by layer-by-layer vacuum filtration. This not only affords
stability and robustness in the electrodes but also facilitates the
diffusion of the electrolyte and improves their electrical conductivity,
thus enhancing the electrochemical properties of Na2Ti3O7. In addition, this method is suitable for large-scale
production due to the low cost of the raw materials and the fact that
the amount of active material can be modulated at will.

Results and Discussion
The free-standing and sandwich-structured flexible NTO NW@CNT@rGO
film electrode was prepared using a two-step fabrication method. First,
NTO NW@CNT was synthesized by a hydrothermal method. In the hydrothermal
process, the carbon nanotubes are combined with Na2Ti3O7 nanowires and can be used as bridges between
nanowires to improve the conductivity of the nanowires. NTO NW@CNT@rGO
flexible electrode materials with a sandwich structure were then prepared
via layer-by-layer vacuum filtration (Figure 1). The graphene therein has a large specific
surface area and good electrical conductivity. The NTO NW@CNT layer
is sandwiched between graphene layers during the process of vacuum
filtration. On the one hand, this method is beneficial as it increases
the contact area between nanowires and graphene and improves the electrical
conductivity of the material. On the other hand, it can improve the
infiltration of the electrolyte and increase the ion conductivity
of the electrode material, thereby improving the electrochemical properties
of Na2Ti3O7.

illustration and ideal electron-transfer
pathway of a free-standing and sandwich-structured flexible film electrode.

Meanwhile, the great flexibility
of the film can be clearly observed
in Figure 2a. The as-prepared
electrodes can remain stable while being folded, which show great
potential for use in highly flexible devices. To investigate the morphological
and structural characteristics of the film, scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) was employed. SEM images showing cross-sectional and top views
of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film are presented in Figure 2b–e. Figure 2b,c shows cross-sectional SEM
images of the as-formed S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film and the corresponding
EDX mapping. As can be seen from Figure 2b, the thickness of the film is about 20
μm and the structure of the cross section is clearly considered
as a layer-by-layer structure. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometry
mapping analysis was further employed for one layer of the film, and
the results are shown in Figure 2c. The main elements of this layer are C (red), O (green),
Na (cyan), and Ti (pink) and are shown in Figure 2c. C refers to the graphene on the upper
surface and is evenly distributed. The shallow red color indicates
that the graphene layer is relatively thin. Na, Ti, and O are the
main elements of NTO and are evenly distributed. The color of the
elements is deep, indicating that NTO is the main constituent of this
layer. The structure of each layer is similar to the sandwich structure,
which is consistent with the effect we expect to achieve by layered
titration and filtration. Subsequently, the upper surface of the film
was observed and is shown in Figure 2d,e. The top-view SEM image reveals that the thin graphene
layer is uniformly distributed on the upper surface of the film on
a large scale and through the graphene layer, interdigitated NTO nanowires
can be clearly seen. At a greater magnification shown in Figure 2e, the graphene layer
is indeed observed, and NTO NW@CNT composites exist under the graphene
layer. Thus, it can be seen that in the as-formed S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
film, the CNT of the NTO NW@CNT layer serves mainly to increase the
connections between nanowires, thus extending the pathway of electron
transfer of the NTO nanowires. The upper and lower graphene layers
serve mainly to increase the contact area with the NTO nanowires and
improve the electrical conductivity of the crossed nanowires.

film; (b, c) SEM images of the cross section and corresponding EDX
mapping of C (red), O (green), Na (cyan), and Ti (pink); and (d, e)
SEM images of the upper surface.

In addition, in Figure 2b, we also see that there is a certain gap between
the layers
in the as-formed S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film, which can facilitate
the penetration of the electrolyte. But how did these gaps form? To
illustrate the problem, the graphene film and the NTO NW@CNT film
were prepared by the same process and then observed and analyzed by
SEM. Figure S1 shows the SEM images of
NTO NW@CNT. It can be seen in Figure S1a that NTO nanowires with the large aspect ratio are very uniform
on the upper surface of the film. The distributions of NTO nanowires
and CNT are also uniform. It is regrettable that after vacuum filtration
the NTO NW@CNT film does not form a multilayer structure that could
be seen in the cross section. However, multilayer graphene is clearly
observed in the cross section of the film after vacuum filtration,
as shown in Figure S2b, which means that
the formation of the multilayered S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film may
be related to the graphene itself. After filtration, graphene oxides
are formed in the film and then undergo a high-temperature process
where some of the oxygen-containing functional groups between the
layers become vaporized oxygen, leading to the emergence of a gap
between the layers, as shown in Figure S2. Therefore, the gaps in the as-prepared sandwich-structured film
containing the graphene oxide occur due to the volatilization of oxygen
after the high-temperature treatment. It is precisely because the
film prepared by our method exhibits a certain gap that the film both
improves the electrical conduction of the electrode and facilitates
the penetration of the electrolyte.

To further understand the
structure of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
film electrode, transmission electron microcopy (TEM) was applied
to observe the Na2Ti3O7 nanowires,
CNT, and rGO of the film. As shown in Figure 3a,b, the interdigitated long NTO nanowires,
including several hundred nanometers or even up to several micrometers
in length, form a three-dimensional (3D) network structure, resulting
in lots of porous structures. As we all know, these porous structures
of the electrode materials likely facilitate the penetration of the
electrolyte and also promote sufficient contact between the NTO nanowires
and the electrolyte, providing shortened ionic diffusion pathways
that may contribute to the improvement of the electrochemical performance
in sodium storage. At the same time, it is clear that the distribution
of the homogeneous NTO nanowires and the CNT is very uniform. CNT
wrapped around the NTO nanowires increases the connectivity between
the nanowires and improves their electrical conductivity. In Figure 3b, the graphene above
the NTO nanowires and CNT can be seen to completely cover the nanowires
having a large contact area with nanowires that greatly improves the
conductivity of the nanowires. Figure 3c shows an HRTEM image of the NTO nanowires. The lattice
fringes show interplanar spacings of 0.84 and 0.35 nm, corresponding
to the distances of the (001) and (102) lattice planes in the NTO
structure. The figure also shows that the NTO nanowires have good
crystallinity, which is beneficial to the electrochemical performance
of NTO. The colored diagrams in Figure 3d show the EDX mapping of NTO nanowires. It can be
seen that the distribution of Na (cyan), O (green), and Ti (red) comprising
Na2Ti3O7 is consistent with the orientation
of the nanowires, indicating that the nanowires are made of sodium
trititanate.

film;
(c) HRTEM image; and (d) TEM and corresponding EDX mapping of Na (cyan),
O (green), and Ti (red).

To quantify the amount of NTO and carbon in the flexible
film,
TGA was carried out in air. The sample was heated from 25 to 800 °C
at a rate of 10 °C min–1. Figure 4a shows the TGA curve of the
S–NTO@CNT@rGO film. The weight loss of the sample is about
16.3%, indicating that the carbon content of the film is about 16.3%,
in line with the requirements for the carbon content of a flexible
film material. In contrast, the NTO nanowires comprise approximately
83.6% of the mass and are the main component of the film. This shows
that the as-prepared film has a certain flexibility, the key being
that the nanowires themselves are also easily prepared as part of
a flexible film. To gain further knowledge of the crystallographic
phase and structure of the different samples, X-ray diffraction (XRD)
tests were performed. As can be seen in Figure 4b, all of the diffraction peaks of NTO NW@CNT
powder correspond to those of layered Na2Ti3O7 (JCPDS card no. 31-1329). In addition, for the as-prepared
NTO NW@CNT@GO film and the NTO NW@CNT@rGO film, the sharp and well-defined
peaks correspond to those of Na2Ti3O7 according to the standard PDF card data. However, compared to that
of the NTO NW@CNT sample, the intensity of the diffraction peak of
NTO NW@CNT@GO becomes stronger at 10.5° and weaker near 25 and
30°. The reason for this phenomenon is that graphene oxide has
a strong diffraction peak at 10.5°, as shown in Figure 4c.36 The diffraction peaks of Na2Ti3O7 and graphene oxide are superimposed at 10.5° so that the intensity
of the diffraction peak is enhanced, whereas those at 25 and 30°
are weakened. After high-temperature treatment, graphene oxide is
reduced to graphene (Figure 4c) and the intensity of the diffraction peak of the S–NTO
NW@CNT@rGO film becomes weaker at 10.5°, consistent with that
of NTO NW@CNT powder. Figure 4d displays the Raman scattering spectra of the rGO film and
the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film. Two distinctive characteristic carbon
bands between 1200 and 1700 cm–1 can be observed.
The asymmetrical shape of the carbon characteristic bands implies
the existence of two types of bonding states of carbon.37 The Raman scattering spectra near 1300 and 1600
cm–1 are the characteristic bands of the C-atom
crystals corresponding to the disorder-induced phonon mode (D band)
and the graphite band (G band) of the sp2 carbon, which
represents the lattice defect of the carbon atom and the in-plane
stretching vibration of the sp2 hybrid of the carbon atom,
respectively.38,39

To quantify the excellent electrochemical
performance of the free-standing
sandwich-structured film prepared by vacuum filtration, the electrochemical
sodium storage characteristics of the flexible S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
film were evaluated by assembling an appropriate mass of the material
in a Na-haft cell. The electrical energy storage capability of the
film electrode was first examined using cyclic voltammograms (CVs). Figure 5a shows the CV curve
at a scanning rate of 0.02 mV s–1 in the potential
range between 2.5 and 0.01 V versus Na/Na+. A couple of
redox peaks located at 0.25 V (cathodic peak) and 0.63 V (anodic peak)
versus Na/Na+ can be observed, representing typical Na+ insertion/extraction in the Na2Ti3O7 crystal lattice. The distinct and well-defined redox peaks
of Na2Ti3O7 indicate its excellent
kinetics performance in the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film electrode.
Moreover, the CV of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO electrode in a voltage
window of 0.01–2.5 V at various sweep rates ranging from 0.01
to 0.1 mV s–1 is presented in Figure S3. The redox peaks in the potential range of about
0.2–0.6 V in the CV data could be attributed to the redox of
the Ti4+/Ti3+ couple. With increasing cycles
and increasing scanning rates, the peak current and the voltage of
the electrodes increased continuously, which is consistent with the
characteristics of the electrode material itself, indicating the great
stability of the as-prepared electrode materials and the good reversibility
of the de/intercalation of sodium ions. The charge/discharge curves
of S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO were calculated at 1C in the voltage range
0.01–2.5 V for 1st, 10th, 20th, 50th, 70th, and 100th cycles,
as shown in Figure 5b. The initial discharge and charge capacities of the S–NTO
NW@CNT@rGO film were 372.2 and 184.4 mA h g–1, respectively,
which are higher than the theoretical capacity of 177 mA h g–1. Similar phenomena have been observed from self-assembled TiO2–graphene hybrid nanostructures40 and graphene-wrapped porous Li4Ti5O12 nanofiber composites.41 The higher capacity suggests additional interfacial Na storage at
the NTO/electrolyte (solid–liquid) and NTO/graphene (solid–solid)
interfaces. The interfacial reaction between the electrode and the
electrolyte led to the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase
(SEI) film, causing a large irreversible capacity loss. In addition,
the electrode displays sloped reaction plateaus located at 0.6 V (charge)
and 0.2 V (discharge), in keeping with the CV curves (Figure 5a) and showing the typical
charge/discharge profiles of the Na2Ti3O7 electrode in SIBs.26,34

rate of 0.02 mV s–1; (b) charge–discharge
curves at different cycles; and (c–f) cycling performance at
current densities of 0.5C, 1C, 2C, and 5C.

To investigate the cycling stability of the film electrodes,
a
cycling performance test was performed at different current densities. Figure 5c–f shows
the cycling performance of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film when the
current densities were 0.5C, 1C, 2C, and 5C, respectively. As can
be seen from Figure 5c–e, the film electrodes show good discharge specific capacity
and Coulombic efficiency. At lower current densities 0.5C, 1C, and
2C, S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO delivers a high initial discharge capacity,
and capacities of 419, 372.2, and 380.5 mA h g–1 can be respectively achieved. Remarkably, after 100 cycles, the
electrode retains high capacities of 107.2, 101, and 97.9 mA h g–1, respectively, which confirms the excellent properties
of Na storage capacity and cycling stability. For the NTO@CNT film
electrode, its initial discharge capacity is only 141.7 mA h g–1, and after 70 cycles, a capacity of 34.2 mA h g–1 is retained, as shown in Figure S4. Similarly, the cycling performance of the NTO@CNT+rGO film
electrode is also very poor. As shown in Figure S5, the NTO@CNT+rGO electrode delivers only 65.3 and 26.5 mA
h g–1 at 0.5C and 1C, respectively, after 100 cycles.
On the other hand, the most impressive observation is that the S–NTO
NW@CNT@rGO electrode still retained a discharge capacity of 80.6 mA
h g–1 after 150 cycles at the highest current density
of 5C, which is a relatively high discharge capacity when Na2Ti3O7 is presently used as the anode material
of SIBs under the same conditions.23,24,42

To further explore the effectiveness of the
sandwich-structured
film in improving the electrochemical performance of Na2Ti3O7 electrodes, the long-term cycling performance
and the rate capability were investigated, as shown in Figure 6. In Figure 6a, the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film electrode
starts at 363.8 mA h g–1 and maintains at 105.7
mA h g–1 after initial precycling. From 11 cycles,
the discharge capacity has remained in a stable range at 2C, and it
is satisfactory that a reversible capacity as high as 92.5 mA h g–1 is still achieved after 100 cycles. Subsequently,
the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO electrode also delivers 59.9 mA h g–1 after a further 100 cycles at 5C. This experiment
fully demonstrates that the as-prepared S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO electrode
possesses better capacity retention and longer lifetime. Figure 6b shows the rate
capabilities of S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO at various current densities.
For each stage, the process was taken from 0.2C to 10C over five cycles.
Compared with the S–NTO NW@CNT+rGO electrode (Figure S6), the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO electrode delivers
discharge capacities of 204.8, 162, 115.5, 86.5, 56, and 31.9 mA h
g–1 at current densities of 0.2C, 0.5C, 1C, 2C,
5C, and 10C, respectively. When cycled back to 5C, 2C, 1C, 0.5C, and
0.2C from 10C, the discharge capacity of the electrode can still reach
up to 59.7, 91.7, 133.6, 166, and 196.8 mA h g–1, indicating the excellent reversibility of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
electrode. To further confirm the excellent electrochemical performance
of the film, the electrode was even continuously cycled for 100 cycles
at a current density of 0.2C, which showed that durable cyclic capacity
with a high reversible capacity of 114.1 mA h g–1 was retained. The above results indicate that the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
electrode has a significant advantage in terms of lifetime and capacity
retention.

electrode in a range of 0.01–2.5 V. (a) Long cycling performance
at different current densities from 2C to 5C; and (b) rate performance
at various current densities from 0.2C to 10C and then cycling performance
at 0.2C.

From the above results, it can
be seen that the as-prepared S–NTO
NW@CNT@rGO flexible electrode materials have excellent electrochemical
performance, which is mainly attributed to the design strategy and
fabrication method of the electrodes. First, the absence of a binder
is beneficial because of the increased electrical conductivity of
the electrodes. The conventional electrode preparation process involves
mixing the active materials, the electronic conductor, and the binder
with the n-methyl-2-pyrroludone solvent and coating
the resultant slurry on copper foil as a current collector.43,44 However, our film electrode without the binder or current collector
can not only improve the electrical conductivity but also effectively
decrease the weight of the SIB system and enhance its energy density.
Second, the Na2Ti3O7 nanowires grown
in situ using the hydrothermal method have many advantages, including
a larger specific surface area for Na+ insertion/extraction
and shortened ion diffusion pathways that promote the charge transfer/collection
kinetics. In addition, many porous structures are formed by intertwined
nanowires, which are more conducive to the infiltration of the electrolyte,
increasing the ion diffusion rate. Third, in the hydrothermal process,
the added nanotubes not only facilitate the uniform dispersion of
nanowires and nanotubes but also contribute to the formation of Na2Ti3O7 nanowires, in which the nanotubes
wrap around the nanowires or connect them, improving the conductivity
of the nanowires themselves. Fourth, to ensure the largest contact
area between the graphene and Na2Ti3O7 nanowires, the process of the as-prepared film is repeated first
with the filtration of graphene and then with that of the NTO NW@CNT.
If this step is not performed, the contact area between graphene and
nanowires is very small because most of the nanowires are inside the
graphene layer rather than lying on the graphene surface, as seen
in Figure S7b,c, leading to the poor conductivity
of the material even with the addition of graphene. Fifth, the sandwichlike
layered-structured film is formed via vacuum filtration. As can be
seen in Figures 2b
and S2, there is a certain gap between
two layers because of the volatilization of oxygen in the reduction
process of graphene oxide, which is beneficial to the infiltration
of the electrolyte. Of course, the gap does not exist for the NTO
NW@CNT+rGO sample in Figure S7a. Finally,
the biggest advantage of sandwich-structured NTO NW@CNT@rGO is its
ability to improve the electrical conductivity itself. Figure 1 shows the schematic representation
and ideal electrotransfer pathway for the as-prepared S–NTO
NW@CNT@rGO film. It can be seen that the electrons can transfer at
will in the graphene layer and between the graphene layer and NTO
NW@CNT layers. In addition, in the NTO NW@CNT layer, CNT connecting
the nanowires can allow the electrons to move freely, implying that
many electron-transfer channels are added. All of these benefits endow
the electrode with the proposed flexible, current collector-free,
binder-free, and sandwich-structured anode configuration, which significantly
improve the cycling performance and the rate capability of the electrode.

To further confirm the structural integrity of the electrodes,
the battery was disassembled after the charge and discharge cycles
and the electrode material was analyzed by both XRD and SEM (Figure 7). In Figure 7a, compared with the diffraction
peaks before cycling, the diffraction peak of the electrode material
after charging and discharging is very obvious at 10.5°, which
is the typical peak of the Na2Ti3O7 pattern corresponding to JCPDS no. 31-1379. This proves that the
electrode material itself does not change after undergoing a rigorous
process of intercalation and deintercalation of sodium ions. SEM images
of a cross section of the S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film electrode after
cycling are shown in Figure 7b,c. The hierarchical structure is still obviously maintained,
and the graphene and NTO nanowires of the interlayer are still observed,
indicating that the sandwich-structured film is very stable. Meanwhile,
as seen in the top view in Figure 7d,e, the morphology of the NTO nanowires remains intact,
and there is still a graphene layer covering the surface of the NTO
nanowires. This means that the graphene layer not only protects the
multilayer structure of the electrode from damage and improves the
electrode conductivity but also ensures that the NTO nanowires are
not destroyed during the charging and discharging process.

Conclusions
In summary, we have
presented a facile approach to produce free-standing
and sandwich-structured NTO NW@CNT@rGO flexible film anode electrodes
for high-performance sodium ion batteries by hydrothermal-assisted
modified vacuum filtration. The as-obtained S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO
flexible electrodes are not only binder-free and current-collector-free
but also exhibit excellent electrochemical performances with a long
cycle lifetime and large capacity for NIBs. At current densities of
0.5C, 1C, and 2C, the discharge capacities of the electrodes can be
maintained at 107.2, 101, and 97.9 mA h g–1 after
100 cycles, respectively. The S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO electrode still
retain a discharge capacity of 80.6 mA h g–1 after
150 cycles at a higher current density of 5C. During a long-term cycling
performance test, after 100 cycles at a current density of 2C, a reversible
capacity of 92.5 mA h g–1 was achieved; the discharge
capacity could reach 59.9 mA h g–1 at 5C after 100
cycles. More importantly, after the rate performance test, a high
reversible capacity of 114.1 mA h g–1 was retained
after a further 100 cycles at 0.2C. The superior electrochemical performance
of the electrodes is believed to be in connection with the unique
sandwich architecture formed by the ultralong Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT layer and highly conductive graphene
layer. Furthermore, this general strategy explores exciting new methods
for the design and fabrication of other flexible films applying to
catalysis, energy storage, and other energy transformation processes.

Experimental
Section
Synthesis of Graphene Oxide (GO)
GO was prepared from
natural graphite by a modified Hummers method.45,46 Briefly, 3 g of graphite powder was slowly added into a mixture
of 50 mL 98% H2SO4, 3 g of K2S2O8, and 3 g of P2O5 and then
the solution was stirred continuously at 80 °C for 5 h. The prepared
preoxidized product was cleaned using deionized water and dried in
a vacuum oven at 80 °C for 12 h. Afterward, it was mixed with
150 mL of 98% H2SO4, forming a black uniform
dispersion. KMnO4 (15 g) was slowly added at a temperature
below 20 °C, then the ice bath was removed, and the mixture was
stirred at room temperature for 1 h. After slowly heating to 35 °C
for 2 h, additional ice–water mixture and 20 mL of 30% H2O2 were slowly added into the mixed solution to
completely react with the excess KMnO4. After 10 min, a
bright yellow solution appeared. The resulting mixture was washed
with diluted aqueous HCl (1/10 v/v) solution and H2O. Graphite
oxide was prepared after freeze-drying in a vacuum oven.

Synthesis of
Na2Ti3O7 Nanowires@CNT
(NTO NW@CNT)
Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT
was synthesized via a simple hydrothermal process. In brief, 20 mL
of 0.2 M tetrabutyl titanate ([CH3(CH2)3O]4Ti) solution in ethanol was mixed with 20 mL of 10 M aqueous
NaOH solution. After adding 0.0403 g of CNT into the solution, the
mixed solution was magnetically stirred and then transferred into
a Teflon-lined stainless steel autoclave. It was heated in an oven
at 190 °C for 12 h. After being air-cooled to room temperature
(25 °C), the precipitate was collected by centrifugation, washed
with deionized water and ethanol several times, and dried in air at
80 °C for 24 h, finally obtaining Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT.

Fabrication of Free-Standing
and Sandwich-Structured Na2Ti3O7 Nanowires@
CNT@Reduced Graphene
Oxide (S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO) Flexible Film Electrode
The
flexible S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO film was fabricated by the vacuum
filtration method. Typically, 20 mg of GO and 10 mg of NTO NW@CNT
were respectively dispersed in 50 mL ethanol and then sonicated for
8 h to form solutions A and B. Subsequently, a sandwich-structured
film was prepared by adding the solution dropwise to a vacuum filter
with a 0.2 μm porous PTFE membrane according to the order “ABAB···”.
Finally, the obtained filter film was peeled off from the microporous
membrane and vacuum-dried at 100 °C for 12 h to obtain a free-standing
film. The film was cut into pieces with a diameter of 10 mm and vacuum-dried
at 200 °C for 4 h to convert graphene oxide to reduced graphene
oxide.

For comparison, a Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT (NTO NW@CNT) film and a Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT+rGO (NTO NW@CNT+rGO) film were also prepared
by vacuum filtration. A dispersion with Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT powder dispersed in ethanol by ultrasonication
was filtered to produce a NTO NW@CNT film. The NTO NW@CNT+rGO film
was obtained by filtering a mixture of the ethanol solution with Na2Ti3O7 nanowires@CNT powder and graphene
oxide.

Material Characterization
The X-ray diffraction patterns
of the prepared samples were obtained using a Bruker D8 advance instrument
at 40 kV and 40 mA with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.154 nm)
(the scanning rate: 3 min–1; the 2θ range:
5–70°). The morphology and particle size of the samples
were investigated using field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM, JSM-7800F) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX).
TEM and HRTEM images were obtained using a JEM-2100F instrument under
a different resolution transmission electron microscope. Raman spectra
were recorded on a PerkinElmer system at a laser wavelength, λ,
of 532 nm. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was carried out using
a STA409 PC thermogravimetric analyzer to determine the carbon content
in the flexible samples.

Electrochemical Measurements
The
electrochemical performance
of the as-prepared samples was investigated by CR2016-type coin half-cells
using Na metal foil as the counter electrode. The free-standing and
flexible S–NTO NW@CNT@rGO films were directly used as the working
electrodes without the involvement of any metal current collector,
conductive additive, or polymeric binder. The half-cells were assembled
in an argon-filled glove box. The mass loading of the active material
in each coin cell was typically 1.0–1.5 mg cm–2. NaClO4 (1 M) in a mixture (1:1, volume) of propylene
carbonate (PC) and ethylene carbonate (EC) was used as the electrolyte,
and a glass microfiber filter (Whatman GF/D) was used to separate
the contacts of the cathode and anode electrode materials. Galvanostatic
charge/discharge measurements were conducted using a LAND CT2001A
test system (Wuhan, China) under various current densities in the
potential range 0.01–2.5 V (vs Na+/Na) at room temperature.
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements were performed using a CHI650D
(Chenhua, Shanghai) electrochemical workstation.
