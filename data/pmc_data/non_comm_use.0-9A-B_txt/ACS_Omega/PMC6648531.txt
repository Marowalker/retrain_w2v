We
have studied unsupported, silica gel- and amorphous silica–alumina-supported
catalysts derived from K salts for the vapor-phase dehydration of
lactic acid (LA) to acrylic acid (AA). A catalytic study shows that
the supported catalysts improve the activity and selectivity for the
production of AA and decrease the selectivity for the production of
propionic acid (PA). The silica–alumina-supported catalysts
remain fairly stable in the catalytic performance during 90 h of reaction.
The IR spectroscopic characterization combined with the catalytic
study demonstrates that potassium lactate (C3H5KO3) in situ generated from LA and a K salt is an important
reaction intermediate for the production of AA and the catalytic stability
is associated with the chemical stability of C3H5KO3 and the activity for the regeneration of C3H5KO3 in the catalytic cycle. On silica–alumina,
C3H5KO3 is well stabilized and smoothly
regenerated during the reaction, leading to the good catalytic stability.
This work suggests for the first time that lactate salt acts as the
true catalytic active species for the dehydration of LA to AA. We
also propose a predominant reaction pathway for the vapor-phase dehydration
of LA to AA with K salt catalyst systems.

1 Introduction
Acrylic
acid (AA) and its derivatives are very versatile monomers
for many industrial and commodity chemicals such as absorbents, detergents,
dispersants, and flocculants.1,2 Due to a complicated
propene oxidative process currently used in the industry, which is
nonrenewable, the development of new processes producing sustainable
AA from biomass derivatives has attracted much research interest.
One of the promising biomass derivatives is lactic acid (LA), which
is inexpensively available from biomass (e.g., starch) fermentation.
AA can be produced from either liquid- or vapor-phase catalytic dehydration
of LA: 1  

The liquid-phase catalytic
formation of AA from LA was first reported
by Odell et al. in 1985.3 At 150–250
°C and atmospheric pressure or below in the presence of group
VIII metal complexes such as [PtH(PEt3)3]+, PtCl2(PPh3)2, IrH(CO)(PPh3)3, and Ni(CO)2(PPh3)2 in aqueous solutions, hydrothermal reactions of LA produced
β-hydroxypropanoic acid, pyruvic acid, acetic acid (HAc), acetaldehyde
(CH3CHO), acetone, and ethanol (EtOH). Under optimal conditions,
an AA yield of only 3.4% was obtained. Later on, the liquid-phase
catalytic dehydration of LA to AA was investigated by Mok et al.4 and further by Lira and McCrackin.5 The reaction was reportedly operated in supercritical
water at 320–400 °C and 310–340 bar. With an initial
LA concentration of 0.1 M and residence time of ∼30 s, the
conversion of LA generally increased together with the yields of CH3CHO and CO as the solution acidity increased.4 In the presence of H2SO4 as a precatalyst,
the conversion of LA was 57–100% with the production of CH3CHO and CO/CO2 as the predominant products. With
the presence of NaOH instead of the acid as a precatalyst, the conversion
of LA decreased to 23–41% with an increase in the yields of
AA and propionic acid (PA). The yields of AA and PA reached a maximum
(13 and 27%, respectively) when a small amount of NaOH was added.4 When Na2HPO4 and NaOH were
used as precatalysts with an initial LA concentration of 0.4 M and
residence time of ∼70 s, the yields of AA were found to be
15 and 6.8%, respectively.5 While the poor
catalytic performance of these liquid-phase catalyst systems for the
dehydration of LA to AA was shown, the nature of the catalytic active
species was not discussed in the earlier studies. Nor the follow-up
of the liquid-phase catalytic dehydration of LA to AA has been reported.

The first patent application on the vapor-phase catalytic dehydration
of LA and alkyl lactates to AA and acrylates was filed by Holmen et
al. in 1958.6 Higher AA yields of 42–68%
were achieved from aqueous 10–50% solutions of LA over sulfate,
phosphate, and mixed inorganic salts at 400–425 °C and
atmospheric pressure. Evidently, the vapor-phase catalytic reaction
displays an incomparable advantage over the liquid-phase catalytic
reaction in the production of AA. Since then, the catalytic process
of vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA has been attracting considerable
interest of catalytic investigators for the sakes of not only high
efficiency but also green chemical manufactural process.1,2 In this area, the selective catalyst systems reported for the production
of AA include sulfate salts, phosphate salts, mixed inorganic salts,
phosphate salt-containing materials, and modified zeolites.1,2,7−11 Alkali- and alkali-earth-metal phosphates and alkali-metal-modified
zeolites were reported to be prominent catalyst systems for dehydration
of LA to AA.1,2,7,12−17 Likely, the catalytic performance for the vapor-phase LA conversion
promoted investigators to shed light on the LA reaction mechanism
and catalytic active species on various catalyst systems.12,16,18−25 Miller and co-workers earlier studied the vapor-phase LA conversion
mechanism on catalyst surfaces by means of IR, NMR, and GC/MS analyses
of surface species apart from catalytic testing and kinetics.18−22,26 They discovered that low temperatures
(<320 °C) and elevated pressures favor 2,3-pentanedione (2,3-PD)
formation, whereas high temperatures and low pressures benefit AA
and CH3CHO production.18,20 They sought
to characterize the catalytic active species starting with various
supported Na salts such as NaOH, NaNO3, Na2SiO3, Na3PO4, Na2HPO4, sodium lactate (C3H5NaO3), NaCl,
and Na2SO4 in the vapor-phase conversion of
LA to 2,3-PD and AA at 280–350 °C.19−21 On low-surface-area
silica, the Na salts studied except NaCl and Na2SO4 when exposed to LA vapor at 150–300 °C authentically
transformed to C3H5NaO3 with the
concurrent formation of their conjugate acids: 2  The resulting C3H5NaO3 was suggested to be the actual
catalyst
and an intermediate for 2,3-PD formation, because the catalytic activity
to 2,3-PD is connected with the presence of the supported C3H5NaO3 under the reaction conditions. However,
at 350 °C, the supported C3H5NaO3 decomposes to sodium propionate (C3H5NaO2) and sodium acetate (NaAc), which was explained to cause
the reduction in catalytic activity to 2,3-PD at higher temperatures.21 The surface chemistry of NaNO3 was
confirmed by recent surface IR results of Sun et al., who investigated
the vapor-phase production of 2,3-PD from LA condensation over a series
of SiO2-supported alkali-metal nitrates.24 The surface reactivity of sodium phosphates was supported
by recent surface IR, Raman, and NMR results of Zhang et al., who
studied the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA over NaY-supported
Na2HPO4 at 340 °C.12

In light of these previous findings with supported Na salts
for
the vapor-phase catalytic conversion of LA, we were interested in
working on K salt-derived supported catalysts for the vapor-phase
dehydration of LA to AA, aiming to design and prepare unique, effective
supported C3H5KO3 catalysts. Lactate
salt catalysts easily suffer from severe deactivation, in disfavor
of the selectivity to AA after a dozen of hours of reaction. Proper
selection of supports may improve the stability of active components
under the reaction conditions. We herein present a good catalytic
stability of K salt-derived amorphous silica–alumina (SiO2–Al2O3)-supported catalysts for
the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA at 350 °C. Both SiO2–Al2O3 and K inorganic salts
have potential processing advantages as low-cost and environmentally
benign materials. It is known that K can function as a vital promoter
to enhance the catalytic activity for the vapor-phase dehydration
of LA to AA.7,15,17 This contribution includes some basic catalytic data that suggest
a predominant reaction pathway with a lactate salt intermediate for
the production of AA. To obtain insights into the reaction mechanism
and catalytic stability, IR spectroscopic monitoring is shown for
the reactivities of LA and reaction intermediates including potassium
lactate (C3H5KO3), potassium acrylate
(C3H3KO2), and C3H5KO2 on different support surfaces. We establish
the association of the catalytic stability with the chemical stability
of C3H5KO3 and the ability of a K-containing
catalyst system to regenerate C3H5KO3 under the reaction conditions. By combining catalytic and IR spectroscopic
studies, we demonstrate that C3H5KO3 is not only an important reaction intermediate but also the true
catalyst in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA.

2 Experimental Section
The aqueous 90% LA solution was supplied
by VWR Chemicals. AA (99%),
PA (99%), and hydroxyacetone (HA, 95%) were obtained from Alfa Aesar.
The 2,3-PD (97%), HAc (≥99%), EtOH (≥99.5%), NaNO3 (≥99%), KNO3 (≥99%), K2CO3 (≥99%), KOH (99.99%), and silica gel (SiO2, grade 15) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. SiO2 was employed without further treatment. The amorphous Na-form SiO2–Al2O3 was prepared according
to the patent literature,27 which was stored
after drying at 110 °C overnight. SiO2-Al2O3(23), SiO2-Al2O3(36), SiO2-Al2O3(77), and
SiO2-Al2O3(138) stand for amorphous
SiO2–Al2O3 (Si/Al = 23:1 molar
ratio), SiO2–Al2O3 (Si/Al
= 36:1 molar ratio), SiO2–Al2O3 (Si/Al = 77:1 molar ratio), and SiO2–Al2O3 (Si/Al = 138:1 molar ratio), respectively. The NH4-form SiO2-Al2O3(36) was
obtained by ion-exchanging SiO2-Al2O3(36) twice with aqueous solutions of 0.5 M NH4NO3 at 80 °C for 17 h. After filtration and washing with deionized
water, the ion-exchanged sample was dried at 110 °C overnight
followed by calcination at 540 °C in air for 5 h to give the
H-form SiO2-Al2O3(36), denoted as
H-SiO2-Al2O3(36). The aqueous 10%
C3H5KO3 solution was synthesized
by reaction of an aqueous LA solution with equimolar KOH at 22 °C
for 17 h. The aqueous solutions of 10% C3H3KO2 and 10% C3H5KO2 were prepared
in a similar manner.

The supported Na and K salt precatalysts
studied in this work such
as KNO3/SiO2, KOH/SiO2, C3H5KO3/SiO2, NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36), K2CO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), and C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) were prepared
by incipient wetting impregnation. The molar ratio of added K or Na
to Si was 1.8:36. The impregnated samples except C3H5KO3/SiO2 and C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) were
dried at 110 °C overnight followed by calcination at 540 °C
in air for 5 h. C3H5KO3/SiO2 and C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) were dried under vacuum (10–2 mmHg) at 22 °C overnight. The physical properties of SiO2, SiO2-Al2O3, and the supported
precatalysts were determined by N2 adsorption–desorption
(see the Supporting Information).

The vapor-phase dehydration reaction of LA was conducted at 350
°C under atmospheric pressure in a vertical, down-flow fixed-bed
reactor. The reactor body consisted of a stainless steel tube (59
cm long, 1.2 cm o.d., and 0.85 cm i.d.), which was mounted in a cylindrical
electric furnace (45 cm long). The catalyst bed was sandwiched in
the middle of the reactor with quartz wool. A bed of glass beads (∼1
g) was placed above the catalyst bed. Prior to the reaction, the powder
of each supported precatalyst was subjected to pelletizing at a pressure
of 40 kN followed by sieving to 400–600 μm particles.
A 0.50 g sample of precatalyst was loaded in the reactor and subsequently
pretreated with the carrier gas N2 + He (N2/He
= 1:5 volumetric ratio) at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1 at 350 °C for 1 h unless otherwise specified. Afterward, an
aqueous 20% LA solution was fed at the top of the reactor along with
the carrier gas to start the reaction, the reactor temperature being
kept at 350 °C. The reaction mixture excluding CH3CHO and gas products was condensed in a cold trap located at the
outlet of the reactor at 22 °C. The collected liquid products
were analyzed by offline HPLC on Shimadzu CTO-20A. The conversion
of LA and the selectivity to the product were estimated following
the formulae reported previously.17 To
experimentally assess possible mass transfer limitations under the
catalytic conditions used here, we examined the variations of reaction
results over KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) with the carrier gas flow rate and particle size of the supported
precatalyst. Increasing the carrier gas flow rate from 30 to 60 mL
min–1 did not alter the reaction results over KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) in the 400–600
μm particles, which can rule out the possibility of external
mass transfer diffusion. Decreasing the particle size of the supported
precatalyst from 400–600 to <400 μm did not change
the reaction results, which assumes that the internal mass transfer
diffusion does not occur. Based on the experimental check, we used
the Weisz–Prater criterion to verify the influence of pore
mass transfer diffusion on the apparent rate of vapor-phase dehydration
of LA to AA over KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) in the 400–600 μm particles.28 Our calculation showed that β ≈
0.08, and thereby NW–P < 0.3,
which can exclude the internal mass transfer diffusion.29

The reaction pathway of the dehydration
of LA to AA was studied
by transmission IR spectroscopy on a BIO-RAD FTS 3000 MX FT-IR spectrometer.
Catalyst samples were ground with KBr in catalyst/KBr (1:50 mass ratio)
and pressed into wafers of 90 mg each at a pressure of 40 kN. The
surface IR spectra were measured under dry air at 22 °C. The
reactivity of LA, C3H5KO3, C3H3KO2, and C3H5KO2 on KBr, SiO2, and SiO2-Al2O3(36) was investigated in an atmosphere- and temperature-controllable
IR cell under atmospheric N2 at a flow rate of 30 mL min–1 at 22–350 °C. The surface IR spectra
were measured under static vacuum (10–2 mmHg) at
room temperature. KBr, SiO2, and SiO2-Al2O3(36) were pressed into wafers of 20–80
mg at a pressure of 40 kN and loaded in the IR cell. After thermal
pretreatment of a wafer at 350 °C under vacuum (10–2 mmHg) for 0.5 h, its IR spectrum was recorded as background. Then,
the wafer was impregnated with a selected compound aqueous solution
in air followed by thermal treatment at different temperatures under
flowing N2. After thermal treatment at each temperature
under flowing N2, the IR cell was evacuated under vacuum
(10–2 mmHg) for 0.5 h at 22 °C, and a surface
IR spectrum was recorded by subtracting the contribution of background.

The acidity of supports and supported precatalysts studied was
measured by temperature-programmed desorption of ammonia (NH3-TPD) (see the Supporting Information).
Analysis of Si, Al, Na, and K was performed by inductively coupled
plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) on a Varian
Vista-MPX CCD simultaneous ICP-OES spectrograph (see the Supporting Information). Elemental analysis of
N was conducted using the thermal conductivity detector (TCD) technique
on a Thermo Scientific FLASH 2000 CHNS/O Analyzer (see the Supporting Information).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Catalytic Properties in
Vapor-Phase Dehydration
of LA to AA
3.1.1 Catalytic Screening
We began with
a regular screening of various catalyst systems in vapor-phase dehydration
of LA at 350 °C to understand the role of each component in a
precatalyst in the change of the catalytic performance. It has been
admitted that the temperature of ∼350 °C is optimal for
the selectivity to AA in vapor-phase dehydration of LA. Table 1 presents the comparative catalytic
results over the supports, unsupported and supported K and Na salts,
after 5 h of reaction in vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C.
The aqueous 20% LA solution had a pH value of ∼2. A blank test
with no precatalyst added indicated that the reaction already proceeds
to a small extent with this acidic reactant solution. When the acid
precatalyst SiO2 with almost no weak acid sites (see the Supporting Information) was used for the reaction,
the conversion of LA was greatly enhanced from 8.5 to 57% with the
concomitant increase in the yield of AA from 2.9 to 7.4%. When another
acid precatalyst SiO2-Al2O3(36) with
weak acid sites (see the Supporting Information) was employed for the reaction, the LA conversion and AA yield were
continuously increased to 85 and 26%, respectively. However, further
increasing the weak acidity (amount of weak acid sites) of the precatalyst
diminished the AA yield to 9.9% although increasing the LA conversion
to 99% by using SiO2-Al2O3(23) as
a precatalyst. Such reaction results with varying precatalyst acidities
suggest that a medium solid weak acidity benefits the catalytic production
of AA from the vapor-phase dehydration of LA.

When the vapor-phase dehydration was run using unsupported
base
K2CO3 or KOH as a solid precatalyst, the LA
conversion and AA yield ascended to ∼74 and ∼27%, respectively.
This seems to be in agreement with the previous argument that solid
base sites likewise effectively catalyze the vapor-phase dehydration
of LA to AA as solid acid sites do.21,22,26,30 The use of the stronger
base KOH instead of K2CO3 did not alter the
LA conversion and AA yield significantly, seemly indicating no influence
of further increased base strength on the catalytic activity. On this
basis, when either K2CO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) or KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36) was used as a precatalyst, the catalytic activity for
the production of AA was only slightly higher than that over SiO2-Al2O3(36). It was recently asserted
that concerted catalysis by weak acid and base sites is remarkably
favorable for the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA.7,14,15,31−34 The scenario noted here does not appear to support the acid–base
concerted effect on the reaction.

The catalytic results with
the unsupported and supported K bases
observed here are hardly elucidated by the acid–base properties
of the precatalysts. At this point, we recalled the surface chemistry
of Na salts occurring on silica during the vapor-phase conversion
of LA to 2,3-PD and AA reported previously.12,19−21,24 Under LA vapor at 150–300
°C, an Na salt like NaOH or NaNO3 is able to completely
transform to C3H5NaO3 on the surface
with the evolution of its conjugate acid like H2O or HNO3.20,21 The resulting C3H5NaO3 is deemed to be the actual catalyst toward the vapor-phase
conversion of LA to 2,3-PD and AA.20,21 We anticipated
that K2CO3, KOH, and KNO3 on SiO2 and SiO2-Al2O3(36) would
behave in a close way under LA vapor at 350 °C to generate the
supported C3H5KO3. On the other hand,
we noticed a tremendous effect of K or Na salt on the enhancement
of AA yield from LA in our work shown in Table 1. The use of an unsupported K or Na salt
increased the AA yield to 13–27% from 2.9% relative to the
catalyst-free system. The incorporation of K salt to SiO2 led to an increase in AA yield from 7.4 to ∼35%. The alkali-metal-free
H-SiO2-Al2O3(36) precatalyst brought
about a huge AA yield drop to 6.8% while producing a high LA conversion
of 97%. The AA yield fell by 74% as compared with that over Na-containing
SiO2-Al2O3(36). These results promoted
us to contemplate the possible unique role of K+- or Na+-derived lactate salt in the catalytic process. The unsupported
K or Na salt systems exhibited much better catalytic performance toward
the production of AA than the K- or Na-free systems. This led us to
reason that the catalytic reaction over a K or Na salt system proceeds
predominantly via a pathway with the lactate salt intermediate.

In turn, we worked on KNO3 and C3H5KO3 supported on SiO2 and on SiO2-Al2O3(36) for the catalytic reaction. As shown
in Table 1, the use
of unsupported KNO3 as a precatalyst led to similar results
to those over either unsupported K2CO3 or KOH,
as expected, likely due to the in situ formation of C3H5KO3 under the reaction conditions in all the three
cases. The SiO2- or SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported K salts resulted in markedly increased LA conversion
and AA yield. This may primarily result from the high dispersion of
K salts on the supports, which creates more available active sites.
These supported K salts indeed transform to C3H5KO3 under the reaction conditions, as confirmed by an
IR study (as shown later). The catalytic behavior over these supported
K salts is on the whole consistent with that over the supported C3H5KO3. The lower LA conversion and AA
yield over the supported C3H5KO3 may
be explained by the partial decomposition of C3H5KO3 during the preparation of the supported C3H5KO3 (as shown by an IR study later). KNO3 appears to be a better precursor of the supported C3H5KO3 than K2CO3 or KOH
for the production of AA. The fact that the AA yield is considerably
improved over KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) or NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) as compared with that over H-SiO2-Al2O3(36) further postulates that a lactate salt-involved
reaction pathway is predominant for the production of AA over a K
or Na salt system. In addition, SiO2-Al2O3(36) scarcely displays a notable advantage of support over
SiO2 in the production of AA in a short term reaction (5
h).

It is known that K possesses more effective promotion than
other
alkali metals in alkali-metal-modified zeolites on the catalytic dehydration
of LA-AA.7,15 In the present work, the K-containing systems
show the prevailing catalytic performance in terms of LA conversion
and selectivity to AA over the Na-containing systems, as seen in Table 1 (and Figure 3). We thus chose KNO3 as the central catalyst precursor to study the catalytic properties
and roles of supported lactate salt in the vapor-phase dehydration
of LA to AA. We assume that the advantageous catalytic performance
arises from the intrinsic higher activity and selectivity of C3H5KO3 for the production of AA regardless
of the influence of K on the acidity of SiO2-Al2O3(36). In fact, the addition of a K salt (nitrate, hydroxide,
and carbonate) to SiO2-Al2O3(36)
merely diminishes the solid acidity slightly (see the Supporting Information). K+ is supposed
to transform to C3H5KO3 under the
reaction conditions with acidic LA and at 350 °C. The intrinsic
activities and selectivities of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 for the production
of AA can be represented by the AA yields and selectivities to AA
over unsupported KNO3 and NaNO3, respectively.
The higher activity and selectivity of C3H5KO3 can be reflected in the AA yield ratio of 1.5 and the selectivity
to AA ratio of 1.4 over the unsupported KNO3 and NaNO3. The differences in the AA yield and selectivity to AA between
KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) and
NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) have
ratios of 1.3 and 1.2, respectively, which appears to result from
the intrinsic activities and selectivities to AA of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 rather than the modification of solid acidity with K. Besides, the
high selectivities to other products found either with the K-free
SiO2-Al2O3(36) (49–61%) or
K-containing SiO2-Al2O3(36) (45–53%)
are reasonably an indication that some side reactions like oligomerization
occur on the strong acid sites of these catalyst systems. The data
of the close selectivities to other products show that the addition
of K to SiO2-Al2O3(36) does not deactivate
the strong acid sites of SiO2-Al2O3(36).

We meanwhile looked into the effect of WHSVLA or residence
time on the catalytic properties of the KNO3-derived supported
catalysts in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA. According to previous
investigations,7,13−15,17,18 the variation of selectivity
to product with WHSVLA or residence time in the vapor-phase
dehydration of LA depends on the catalyst system used. No common trend
is conclusive. Given a WHSVLA value or residence time,
the selectivity virtually varies as functions of both temperature
and reaction time.15,18 Gunter et al. who used Na3PO4/SiO2–Al2O3 with a high Al2O3 content as a precatalyst
observed that the selectivities to AA and 2,3-PD increased with increasing
residence time at 280–300 °C.18 However, at 350 °C, both of them increased with increasing
residence time up to 1–2 s and fell with further increasing
residence time.18 Ghantani et al. reported
that, at 375 °C over a calcium hydroxyapatite, the selectivities
to AA and CH3CHO ascends and declines, respectively, with
decreasing WHSVLA (or with increasing residence time).13 From the experiments of Yan et al., the selectivity
to AA was found to increase with decreasing WHSVLA (or
with increasing residence time) up to 2.1–1.4 h–1 and decline with further decreasing WHSVLA at 8 h of
reaction at 360 °C over a calcium hydroxyapatite and over a Na
and K-containing β zeolite.14,15 In our investigation,
the WHSVLA was varied by adjusting both the precatalyst
amount and LA solution feeding flow rate; the carrier gas flow rate
being maintained at 30 mL min–1. Table 2 shows the variation of LA conversion
and selectivity to product with WHSVLA in the vapor-phase
dehydration of LA at 350 °C over KNO3/SiO2 and KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36).
When the WHSVLA was increased 3- or 4-fold, the LA conversion
depleted to a much lesser extent only (by 22–53%) over both
catalyst systems. The variation of selectivity to product with WHSVLA depended on the catalyst system and reaction time. At 5
h of reaction, the selectivities to AA and to 2,3-PD increased with
decreasing WHSVLA (or with increasing residence time) over
both catalyst systems. This variation trend is in accordance with
what have been reported in the abovementioned papers. Our WHSVLA values and residence times fall in the ranges of below 2.1
h–1 and below 2 s, respectively. At 22–28
h of reaction over KNO3/SiO2, the selectivity
to AA increased, while the selectivity to 2,3-PD almost decreased
with decreasing WHSVLA. At 47–53 h of reaction over
KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), the
selectivity to AA almost decreased, while the selectivity to 2,3-PD
decreased with decreasing WHSVLA. From these results, low
WHSVLA is favorable for the production of both AA and 2,3-PD
in a short term reaction (5 h) at 350 °C over both catalyst systems.
For a long term reaction at 350 °C over KNO3/SiO2, low WHSVLA is also beneficial for the production
of AA. However, for a long term reaction at 350 °C over KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), high WHSVLA is helpful for the production of both AA and 2,3-PD. These
observed different trends may be attributed to different catalytic
behavior leading to different reaction kinetics.

3.1.2 Catalytic Stability
The catalytic
screening at 5 h of reaction reflects merely the essential catalytic
properties rather than the overall situation including induction,
deactivation, and decay of a catalyst system. To better realize the
correlation between the catalytic performance and possible catalytic
active species, we next tested the catalytic stability of various
catalyst systems in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA at 350
°C. Figures 1–3 illustrate
the comparative LA conversion and selectivity to AA as a function
of reaction time at a WHSVLA value of 0.46 h–1 over the unsupported and supported catalyst systems. The unsupported
K2CO3, KOH, and KNO3 behaved similarly
in catalytic stability, comparable catalytic profiles being observed
(Figure 1). Following
an induction period, the LA conversion decreased quickly with reaction
time, while the selectivity to AA fell slightly after ∼21 h.
The LA conversion dropped from 67% at 5 h to 45% at 28 h over the
unsupported KNO3, which gave rise to a simultaneous tremendous
drop in AA yield from 23% at 5 h to 12% at 28 h. We inferred that
the unsupported K salt catalyst systems deactivate susceptibly during
the reaction, leading to a poor catalytic stability. Over KOH/SiO2, KNO3/SiO2 and C3H5KO3/SiO2, the catalytic stability did not improve,
although the selectivity to AA remained stable with reaction time
(Figure 2). This hints
that the use of SiO2 does not stabilize the presumed catalytic
active species but the selectivity to AA only. In contrast, the SiO2-Al2O3(36) and SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported catalyst systems behaved in a
distinct way. Following an induction period, the LA conversion was
maintained fairly stable without apparent decrease, while the selectivity
to AA increased slowly in all the cases (Figure 3). This suggests that the use of SiO2-Al2O3(36) not only improves the stability
of the presumed catalytic active species but also enhances the selectivity
to AA. The production of large amounts of other products (Table 1) that easily induce
coke formation essentially does not cause catalyst deactivation or
poor catalytic stability either with the K-free SiO2-Al2O3(36) or K-containing SiO2-Al2O3(36). The addition of K to SiO2-Al2O3(36) apparently has no impact on the catalytic stability.

Figure 3 LA conversion and selectivity to AA as a function of reaction time
in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C over (a) SiO2-Al2O3(36), (b) K2CO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (c) KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (d) KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (e) C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), and
(f) NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36).

On the basis of the above results,
we extended the catalytic stability
test of KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) to the conditions of longer reaction time and higher WHSVLA. At a WHSVLA value of 0.46 h–1, a good catalytic stability was observed up to 97 h: the LA conversion
slightly declined from 97% (5 h) to 92%, and the selectivity to AA
slightly increased from 43% (5 h) to 51% with the concomitant low
selectivity to PA and 2,3-PD (2.9 and 2.8% at 97 h, respectively),
as shown in Figure 4. When using a WHSVLA value of 1.8 h–1, a good catalytic stability was likewise obtained up to at least
90 h: the LA conversion of 78% at 5 h remained almost unchanged, and
the selectivity to AA of 46% at 5 h decreased slowly to 40% with the
concurrent low selectivity to PA and 2,3-PD (6.5 and 7.0% at 90 h,
respectively), as shown in Figure 5. These catalytic stability data postulate that the
presumed catalytic active species derived from the K salts during
the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA is well stabilized on SiO2-Al2O3(36).

3.2 IR Characterization of
Catalyst Systems
3.2.1 Surface Properties of
Catalyst Systems
To confirm the presumed catalytic active
species derived from the
K salts in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA, a comparative
IR study of various catalyst systems before and after the reaction
was performed. As C3H5KO3, LA, AA,
and PA are involved as the major surface species on the catalyst systems
during the reaction, the surface IR spectra in the 2500–900
cm–1 region of these compounds in KBr wafers are
given in Figure 6 for
reference. The most noticeable spectral features are strong νC=O
stretching vibration bands at 1595 cm–1 for C3H5KO3 and at 1708–1732 cm–1 for LA, AA, and PA. Other identifying spectral features
include δOH deformation, δCH3 deformation,
δCH deformation, rCH3 rocking, νC–CH3 stretching vibration, (δCH3 + νCO)
vibrational coupling, and (δOH + νCO) vibrational coupling
bands for these compounds. The spectrum of the self-prepared C3H5KO3 in KBr exhibited a set of bands
at 1595(s), 1456(m), 1412(m), 1373(sh), 1354(m), 1310(w), 1121(m),
1088(w), and 1034(m) cm–1. These bands are in accordance
with those for C3H5NaO3 in water
in the literature.35 The IR spectra of
LA, AA, and PA in KBr wafers are also consistent with those assigned
for these compounds in the liquid form in the literature.35−37

Figure 6 IR
spectra of (a) self-prepared C3H5KO3, (b) LA, (c) AA, and (d) PA.

In Figure 7, the
surface IR spectra of SiO2, KNO3/SiO2, C3H5KO3/SiO2, and KOH/SiO2 in KBr wafers in the 2500–1000 cm–1 region are presented. On all the samples, there was a broad band
around 1632 cm–1 due to the δOH angular deformation
of molecular H2O adsorbed on SiO2. On KNO3/SiO2, a sharp band present at 1385 cm–1 is assigned to the degenerate ν3 (e′) antisymmetric stretching vibration of NO3– (Figure 7b),38 while no band for NO2– was visible. The IR observations are consistent with
the TCD elemental analysis of N (see the Supporting Information), which assumes that most of the KNO3 has decomposed to K2O on SiO2 straightly after
calcination at 540 °C in air, likely due to the interaction between
KNO3 and SiO2. On C3H5KO3/SiO2, six broad bands fell at 1722(sh),
1585(s), 1454(m), 1422(m), 1358(sh), and 1306(sh) cm–1. This spectrum deviates from that of C3H5KO3 in Figure 6a. The 1722 cm–1 band may be due to small amounts
of LA formed by light hydrolysis of C3H5KO3 on the SiO2 surface (as explained later). The
presence of the lower wavenumber of νC=O stretching vibration
(1585 cm–1) assumes the loss of the α-OH group
on the lactate salt.21 The spectral deviation
may be caused by partial decomposition of C3H5KO3 on SiO2 during the preparation of C3H5KO3/SiO2. After deliberation
and IR spectral analysis of some related compounds,36,39,40 we assume that C3H5KO3 would dehydrate to C3H3KO2 in part in the drying process of C3H5KO3/SiO2 under vacuum at 22 °C. The 1585
cm–1 band may be referred to as an overlap of the
1595 cm–1 band as the main feature of C3H5KO3 and the 1562 cm–1 band
as the principal feature of C3H3KO2. The 1640(m) cm–1 band as a feature of C3H3KO2 may be located under the broad, intense
1632 cm–1 band. The bands at 1454, 1422, and 1358
cm–1 may be viewed as a superimposition of the features
of C3H5KO3 at 1456, 1412, and 1354
cm–1 and the features of C3H3KO2 at 1450, 1430, and 1368 cm–1. It
is worth mentioning that the severe decomposition of C3H5NaO3 to C3H5NaO2 and NaAc on low-surface-area silica after the thermal treatment
in He or vapor-phase LA conversion at 350 °C was determined using
GC/MS, IR, and 1H NMR by Tam et al.21 The νC=O stretching vibration band was observed
to shift from 1593 cm–1 at 150 °C to 1569 cm–1 at 350 °C during the thermal treatment in He.21

Figure 7 IR spectra of (a) SiO2, (b) KNO3/SiO2, (c) C3H5KO3/SiO2, and (d) KOH/SiO2.

In Figure 8, the
surface IR spectra in KBr wafers in the 2500–1000 cm–1 region of the spent KOH, KNO3, SiO2, KNO3/SiO2, C3H5KO3/SiO2, and KOH/SiO2 catalyst samples in ∼28
h of reaction at 350 °C are shown. The spent KOH and KNO3 catalyst samples gave a similar spectrum of broad bands at
1802(w), 1697(s), 1562(vs), 1450(s), 1402(s), 1377(sh), 1304(s), and
1257(s) cm–1. Some factors such as the interaction
between the catalyst and support and interaction between the catalyst,
adsorbed product and adsorbed H2O content, etc., render
the assignment of such a complex spectrum rather difficult. The bands
at 1802, 1450, 1377, 1304, and 1257 cm–1 are tentatively
attributed to crystalline AA.41 The 1697
cm–1 band may be regarded as an overlap of the 1708
cm–1 band for dimeric AA (Figure 6c) and the 1680 cm–1 band
for crystalline AA.39 Another band around
1630 cm–1 for crystalline AA may be covered under
the broad, intense 1562 cm–1 band. The 1562 cm–1 band may be viewed as a signature feature of C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2.36,39 Another signature feature of C3H3KO2 at 1634 cm–1 is also
covered (as confirmed later in Figure 19). The presence of the 1402 cm–1 band is presumably related to the formation of C3H5KO2 (as shown later). The downward shift in wavenumber
with respect to the band assigned for liquid C3H5KO2 may be caused by the interaction between the spent
catalyst samples and adsorbed AA. The results suggest that the reaction
of KOH or KNO3 with LA eventually results in C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 in the solid phase under the reaction conditions. It is reasonably
believed that C3H5KO3 is the primary
product, which subsequently dehydrates to C3H3KO2 followed by hydrogenation to C3H5KO2 in part: 3   4   5  When the steps of the C3H3KO2-to-AA and C3H5KO2-to-PA conversions are rate-limiting in the LA dehydration
process, the spent catalyst sample will be present in the forms of
C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2. If C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 do not act as important reaction
intermediates for the production of AA, then the slower steps will
entirely impede the catalytic LA dehydration reaction (resulting in
lower LA conversion, lower selectivity to AA, and higher selectivity
to PA). We attribute the poor catalytic stability of the unsupported
K salt systems for the production of AA to the slow C3H3KO2-to-AA conversion step that facilitates the
formation of C3H5KO2 and PA. On the
spent KNO3/SiO2, C3H5KO3/SiO2, and KOH/SiO2 catalyst samples,
similar spectra to those of the spent KOH and KNO3 catalyst
samples were obtained except an extra shoulder band at 1595 cm–1. The 1595 cm–1 band is characteristic
of C3H5KO3. The results suggest that
the spent SiO2-supported K salts contain C3H5KO3 as the minor form and C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 as the
major forms. Similar to the cases of the unsupported KOH and KNO3, the poor catalytic stability of the SiO2-supported
K salt systems for the production of AA can be ascribed to the predominant
formation of C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2. In support of the IR observations of
C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2, the reaction data show lower activity to AA and higher
selectivity to PA after 28 h of reaction over KNO3 and
KNO3/SiO2, as seen in Table 1. In both cases, a higher selectivity ratio
of ∼0.6 for the formation of PA and AA is produced. Our IR
observations of C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 over the spent K salt catalyst
samples are somewhat consistent with what was reported by Tam et al.
on the severe decomposition of C3H5NaO3 on low-surface-area silica during the vapor-phase LA conversion
at 350 °C.21

spent catalyst samples in ∼28
h of the vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C: (a) KOH, (b)
KNO3, (c) SiO2, (d) KNO3/SiO2, (e) C3H5KO3/SiO2, and (f) KOH/SiO2.

In Figure 9, the
surface IR spectra in KBr wafers in the 2500–1000 cm–1 region of SiO2-Al2O3(36), KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36), and NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) are given.
On KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36)
or NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36),
the observation of a narrow band at 1383 cm–1 is
indicative of the existence of NO3– (Figure 9b,e).38 Meanwhile, no band for NO2– was present. The IR observations are likewise in accordance with
the TCD elemental analysis of N (see the Supporting Information), which suggests that most of the KNO3 or NaNO3 has decomposed to K2O on SiO2-Al2O3(36) straightly after calcination
at 540 °C in air, likely because of the interaction between KNO3 or NaNO3 and SiO2-Al2O3(36). On C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), six broad bands appeared
at 1722(sh), 1584(s), 1456(m), 1420(m), 1366(w), and 1310(w) cm–1. This spectrum more or less deviates from that of
C3H5KO3 in Figure 6a, closely resembling that of C3H5KO3/SiO2 in Figure 7c. The 1722 cm–1 band may
correspond to small amounts of LA formed presumably by light hydrolysis
of C3H5KO3 on the SiO2–Al2O3 surface. The spectral deviation
may likewise result from dehydration of C3H5KO3 to C3H3KO2 in part
on SiO2-Al2O3(36) during the drying
process of C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) under vacuum at 22 °C.

In Figure 10, the
surface IR spectra in KBr wafers in the 2500–1000 cm–1 region of the spent SiO2-Al2O3(36),
KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36), K2CO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), and NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) catalyst samples in 28–54 h of reaction at 350
°C are illustrated. Except the spent C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) catalyst
sample, all the spent catalyst samples had a close spectrum comprising
broad bands around 1803(w), 1701(s), 1595(vs), 1452(s), 1412(s), 1371(s),
and 1310(sh) cm–1. The obvious bands at 1803, 1452,
1371, and 1310 cm–1 may belong to the features of
crystalline AA. The 1701 cm–1 band may be a result
of the overlap of the 1708 cm–1 band for dimeric
AA and the 1680 cm–1 band for crystalline AA. Another
band around 1630 cm–1 for crystalline AA may be
located under the broad, intense 1595 cm–1 band.
The bands at 1595 and 1412 cm–1 are the major features
characteristic of C3H5KO3 or C3H5NaO3 (Figure 6a). It is of interest to note that the latter
two bands are able to remain with the spent catalyst samples after
28–54 h of reaction. This clearly accounts for that the K or
Na salts transform to C3H5KO3 or
C3H5NaO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under the reaction conditions and the resulting
C3H5KO3 or C3H5NaO3 is well stabilized with the presence of SiO2-Al2O3(36). Note that the SiO2-Al2O3(36) used here contains some extra Na that should
be converted to C3H5NaO3 under the
reaction conditions. At the same time, the stabilization of C3H5KO3 or C3H5NaO3 (the presence of the 1595 and 1412 cm–1 bands) is accompanied by the absence of the 1402 cm–1 band. Once the lactate salt converts to acrylate and propionate
(the 1595 cm–1 band shifts to 1562 cm–1), the 1412 cm–1 band will move to 1402 cm–1 with other bands remaining substantially unchanged,
as shown by comparing Figures 8 and 10. Hence, the presence of the
1402 cm–1 band in Figure 8 may be associated to the formation of propionate.
With the spent C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) catalyst sample, the initial bands
at 1584 and 1420 cm–1 (Figure 9c), which are presumably due to a mixture
of C3H5KO3 and C3H3KO2, shift to 1570 and 1408 cm–1 (Figure 10c). This
implies that C3H5KO3 converts to
C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 in part during the reaction over C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36). The C3H5KO3 supported on SiO2-Al2O3(36) seems less stable than the
in situ-formed C3H5KO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) from the K or Na salts during
the reaction.

Figure 10 IR spectra of the following spent catalyst samples in
28–54
h of the vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C: (a) SiO2-Al2O3(36), (b) KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (c) C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (d)
KOH/SiO2-Al2O3(36), (e) K2CO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36), and
(f) NaNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36).

We ascribe the good catalytic
stability of the SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported
K salt systems for the production
of AA to the speedup of the C3H3KO2-to-AA conversion step with the aid of SiO2-Al2O3(36). Such a promotional effect results in the emergence
of C3H5KO3 in the spent catalyst
samples. Once this step is accelerated, the C3H5KO3-to-C3H3KO2 conversion
step may become rate-limiting so that the C3H3KO2-to-C3H5KO2 conversion
might be restricted in the LA dehydration process. In such a case,
the spent supported K salt is present in the form of the supported
C3H5KO3 that likely acts as the catalytic
active species. The IR observations of the supported C3H5KO3 are consistent with the reaction data
over the supported K salt systems. In contrast to the cases with KNO3 and KNO3/SiO2, the high activity to
AA and lower selectivity to PA are produced after 28 h of reaction
with KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36),
as shown in Table 1. A much lower selectivity ratio of 0.1 for the production of PA
and AA is obtained.

At this stage, the comparative IR analyses
of our catalyst systems
before and after the catalytic reaction have revealed that K or Na
salts (nitrate, hydroxide, and carbonate) readily react with LA to
produce C3H5KO3 or C3H5NaO3 during the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to
AA at 350 °C and the in situ-formed C3H5KO3 or C3H5NaO3 is stable
on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under the catalytic
conditions. By contrast, either the unsupported or SiO2-supported lactate salt has been proven to be unstable under the
catalytic conditions. The catalytic stability of our catalyst systems
can gain support from the chemical stability of the lactate salt during
the reaction. The good catalytic stability over C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) or C3H5NaO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) may be associated to the good chemical
stability of the lactate salt on SiO2-Al2O3(36). The poor catalytic stability over C3H5KO3 or C3H5KO3/SiO2 may be correlated with the poor chemical stability
of C3H5KO3 alone or on SiO2. As such, the lactate salt can be regarded as the catalytic active
species for the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA. In this aspect,
C3H5NaO3 supported on low-surface-area
silica was once proposed to be the active catalyst and an intermediate
for 2,3-PD formation from LA by Miller and co-workers.20,21 Unfortunately, the supported C3H5NaO3 failed to resist against decomposition at reaction temperatures
from 200 °C upward.21 To our knowledge,
our present contribution includes for the first time the stabilization
of lactate salt as the catalytic active species for conversion of
LA.

3.2.2 Reactivity of LA, C3H5KO3, C3H3KO2, and C3H5KO2
From the correlation
between the above catalytic and IR results, the stabilization of lactate
salt plays a pivotal role in the catalytic stability of a K- or Na-containing
system in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA. The chemical stability
of lactate salt determines the stability in the catalytic performance.
During LA dehydration, the formation of surface lactate salt was proposed
as the critical step in the catalytic reaction pathway resulting in
2,3-PD or AA by several groups.12,14−16,19−22,24,25 Moreover, it is well known that the vapor-phase
catalytic conversion of lactates to AA proceeds selectively over various
heterogeneous acid catalyst systems.6,25,42−48 To provide evident insights into the roles of LA, lactate, acrylate,
and propionate salts in the catalytic pathway of dehydration of LA
to AA, we monitored the chemical behavior of LA and C3H5KO3 on SiO2 and SiO2-Al2O3(36) and the reactivities of LA with C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 on KBr and SiO2-Al2O3(36)
under flowing N2 at different temperatures by transmission
IR spectroscopy.

In Figure 11, the surface IR spectra taken in the 2500–1100
cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA on
SiO2 under flowing N2 are shown. A SiO2 wafer was impregnated with a drop of diluted LA aqueous solution
followed by treatment under flowing N2 at 22 °C for
1.5 h. The resultant spectrum gave a set of broad bands at 1720(s),
1626(s), 1454(m), 1416(sh), 1381(m), and 1354(m) cm–1. The bands at 1720, 1454, 1416, and 1381 cm–1 are
assignable to the adsorbed LA. The 1626 cm–1 band
is assigned to the adsorbed molecular H2O. The bands at
1454, 1381, and 1354 cm–1 together with the 1759
cm–1 band probably hidden under the broad 1720 cm–1 band are attributable to poly(LA).49 LA seems to polymerize susceptibly on the SiO2 surface: 6  

Figure 11 IR spectra of LA or
its derivatives on SiO2 after treatments
under flowing N2 at (a) 22 °C for 1.5 h, (b) 100 °C
for 0.5 h, and (c) 350 °C for 0.5 h.

LA polymerization under an acidic condition has been previously
reported.50 As the temperature increased,
the center of the 1720 cm–1 band markedly shifted
toward higher wavenumbers as seen in Figure 11b,c. After 0.5 h of treatment at 350 °C,
a strong 1759 cm–1 band characteristic of poly(LA)
was observed with the disappearance of the 1720 cm–1 band. At the same time, other bands at 1450(m), 1404(sh), 1379(m),
1350(m), and 1314(m) cm–1 were present, which are
also attributed to poly(LA). Evidently, LA is fully transformed to
poly(LA) upon heating LA/SiO2 to 350 °C.

In Figure 12, the
surface IR spectra collected in the 2500–1100 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of C3H5KO3 on SiO2 under flowing N2 are
shown. After a SiO2 wafer was impregnated with a drop of
diluted C3H5KO3 aqueous solution
and subsequently treated under flowing N2 at 22 °C
for 1.5 h, the resultant spectrum contained a set of bands at 1724(w),
1692(w), 1587(s), 1454(m), 1418(m), 1375 (w), 1350(m), 1312 (w), and
1298 (w) cm–1. The bands at 1587, 1454, 1418, 1375,
1350, and 1312 cm–1 are mostly due to the presence
of C3H5KO3. A slight shift of the
main feature to 1587 cm–1 may imply that light dehydration
of C3H5KO3 to C3H3KO2 already takes place on SiO2 at 22
°C. The 1724(w) cm–1 band is assigned to small
amounts of LA issued from light hydrolysis of C3H5KO3 on SiO2 at 22 °C: 7  The appearance of the bands
at 1692(w) and 1298(w) cm–1 assumes that AA is already
formed in small amounts catalytically at 22 °C. When the temperature
was raised to 100 °C, the latter two bands increased at the expense
of the intensity of the 1587 cm–1 band, which suggests
that more AA is produced via C3H5KO3. This appears to account for the role of an intermediate that we
think C3H5KO3 plays in the dehydration
of LA to AA. It may be possible that the hydrolysis of C3H5KO3 is strengthened to produce more LA, part
of which reacts with C3H3KO2 to give
AA and C3H5KO3: 8  When the temperature
reached
350 °C, the 1587 cm–1 band dropped in intensity
in favor of the growth of the main feature of poly(LA) at 1761 cm–1. Poly(LA) is present as the major product in terms
of the IR band intensity. This implies that LA polymerization is accelerated
and dominates on SiO2 at 350 °C, which triggers a
greater equilibrium shift of C3H5KO3 hydrolysis to LA. Based on the absence of the band of the adsorbed
molecular H2O, it is believed that the conversion of C3H5KO3 to LA proceeds via hydrolysis
on SiO2, which consumes the adsorbed molecular H2O.

on SiO2 after treatments under flowing N2 at
(a) 22 °C for 1.5 h, (b) 100 °C for 0.5 h, and (c) 350 °C
for 0.5 h.

The thermal reactivity
of C3H5KO3 on SiO2 illustrated
in Figure 12 indicates
the predominant polymerization
of LA hydrolyzed from C3H5KO3 over
dehydration of C3H5KO3 to C3H3KO2, which is contrary to the IR results
on the spent SiO2-supported K salt catalyst samples in Figure 8. The cause may lie
in the difference in water content between the two sample preparative
ways, resulting in the difference in LA production. To reveal the
effect of water content on the reaction outcome of C3H5KO3 on SiO2, we comparatively tracked
the surface IR evolution during the thermal reaction of the C3H5KO3/SiO2 precatalyst in
a KBr wafer. After the drying treatment under vacuum at 22 °C,
the water content in the C3H5KO3/SiO2 precatalyst is believed to be much lower. As a result, no
bands of poly(LA) appeared in spite of the emergence of the signature
bands of LA and AA at 1727 and 1687 cm–1 during
the thermal reaction, as shown in Figure 13. The signature band of C3H5KO3 at 1594 cm–1 was not retained
until after a longer thermal reaction at 350 °C. Subsequently,
the signature bands of C3H3KO2 at
1630 and 1570 cm–1 were predominantly present, which
is consistent with the spectrum of the spent C3H5KO3/SiO2 catalyst sample (Figure 8e). During the thermal reaction,
the presence of bands at 2375, 2356, and 2340 cm–1 is attributed to the adsorption of CO2 on SiO2,51 which were produced from the catalytic
dehydration of LA. As such, LA polymerization is facilitated by the
presence of higher water content that ensures hydrolysis of C3H5KO3 to LA on SiO2. Poly(LA)
production is limited in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA over K
or Na salt catalyst systems.

flowing N2 at
(a) 22 °C for 1.5 h, (b) 100 °C for 0.5 h, (c) 200 °C
for 0.5 h, (d) 300 °C for 0.5 h, (e) 350 °C for 0.5 h, and
(f) 350 °C for 3.5 h.

In Figure 14, the
surface IR spectra recorded in the 2500–1100 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under flowing N2 are shown. A
SiO2-Al2O3(36) wafer was impregnated
with a drop of diluted LA aqueous solution followed by treatment under
flowing N2 at 22 °C for 1.5 h. The resultant spectrum
presented a set of bands at 1722(sh), 1618(s), 1593(s), 1474(m), 1454(m),
1422(m), 1377 (sh), 1362(m), and 1314 (w) cm–1.
The presence of the bands at 1593(s) cm–1 as the
main feature of C3H5NaO3 and 1722(sh)
cm–1 as the principal feature of LA indicates that
much of the LA converts to C3H5NaO3 and H+ by acting with surface Na+ on the Na-containing
SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 22 °C: 9  Upon heating to 100
°C,
the 1722 cm–1 band shifted to 1715 cm–1 with the concomitant appearance of the 1296 cm–1 band and diminution of the 1593 cm–1 band intensity.
This hints that AA is already formed via C3H5NaO3 catalytically. Upon heating to 350 °C, a feature
of crystalline AA appeared at 1807 cm–1. The 1715
cm–1 band shifted to 1707 cm–1 with the concomitant increase of the 1296 cm–1 band intensity. Meanwhile, the 1593 and 1618 cm–1 bands disappeared, and a 1607 cm–1 band appeared
instead. The 1607 cm–1 band is ascribed to C3H5NaO3, which may presumably result
from the interaction between C3H5NaO3 and AA on SiO2-Al2O3(36). The results
indicate that C3H5NaO3 issued from
LA strongly converts to AA on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C. While the reaction was continued at 350
°C, the 1607 cm–1 band remained unchanged,
accounting for the good chemical stability of C3H5NaO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36).
However, it is uncertain from the IR results in Figure 14 whether C3H5NaO3, being a possible intermediate, is able to
directly result in AA in the reaction pathway, independently of the
participation of LA. We next thus followed the IR evolution of C3H5KO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at different temperatures starting with C3H5KO3.

Figure 14 IR spectra of LA or its derivatives on
SiO2-Al2O3(36) after treatments under
flowing N2 at
(a) 22 °C for 1.5 h, (b) 100 °C for 0.5 h, (c) 350 °C
for 0.5 h, (d) 350 °C for 1.5 h, and (e) 350 °C for 4 h.

In Figure 15, the
surface IR spectra measured in the 2500–1100 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of C3H5KO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36)
under flowing N2 are shown. After a SiO2-Al2O3(36) wafer was impregnated with a drop of diluted
C3H5KO3 aqueous solution and subsequently
treated under flowing N2 at 22 °C for 1.5 h, the resultant
spectrum consisted of a set of bands at 1730(w), 1593(vs),1470(m),
1454(m), 1423(s), 1362(m), and 1314 (w) cm–1. The
presence of the bands at 1730(w) cm–1 as the main
feature of LA apart from 1593(vs) cm–1 as the principal
feature of C3H5KO3 shows that part
of the C3H5KO3 transforms to LA on
SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 22 °C. The
absence of a visible band around 1618 cm–1 for the
adsorbed molecular H2O further assumes that the transformation
of C3H5KO3 to LA occurs via hydrolysis
on SiO2-Al2O3(36). Increasing the
temperature to 100 °C speeded up the formation of LA and produced
AA simultaneously. As a matter of fact, the 1730 cm–1 band increased in intensity and shifted to 1722 cm–1, and a 1296 cm–1 band emerged at the expense of
the 1593 cm–1 band intensity. Upon heating to 350
°C, the 1593 cm–1 band intensity kept decreasing
in favor of the shift of the 1722 cm–1 band to 1705
cm–1 and the increase of the 1296 cm–1 band intensity. Meanwhile, the relative band intensity of 1705 to
1722 cm–1 increased significantly. This significantly
indicates that the production of AA involves the consumption of both
C3H5KO3 and LA and C3H5KO3 acts as an intermediate to produce AA. As the
heating was continued at 350 °C, the intensity of the existing
bands declined progressively, likely due to the desorption of these
compounds from the surface. There was no longer an increase in the
intensity of the bands of LA and AA, which hints that there are no
more LA and AA produced from C3H5KO3 on the surface. After heating at 350 °C for >1.5 h, it is
deemed
that no more LA remains on the surface (Figure 15d–g). At the same time, no AA was
detected on the surface, although the amount of C3H5KO3 decreased obviously on the surface (Figure 15d–g). The
results postulate that C3H5KO3 as
an intermediate is unable to give rise to AA directly without combination
with LA. On the other hand, the location of the 1593 cm–1 band remained unchanged at 350 °C for 1.5 h. This further confirms
the good chemical stability of C3H5KO3 as the possible catalytic species on SiO2-Al2O3(36). When the supported C3H5KO3 alone was further treated at 350 °C for a prolonged
period, the center of the 1593 cm–1 band gradually
shifted up to 1581 cm–1 (Figure 15g), which assumes the formation of small
amounts of C3H3KO2 by dehydration.
This fact signifies that the dehydration step of C3H5KO3 to C3H3KO2 in the catalytic cycle is able to take place on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C but harder.

for 10 h.

Unlike in the case of C3H5KO3 on
SiO2, no visible bands of poly(LA) are discerned during
the thermal reaction of C3H5KO3 on
SiO2-Al2O3(36). Catalytic LA polymerization
is negligible on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under
equivalent conditions. Similar behavior is observed during the thermal
reaction of the as-prepared C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) precatalyst (Figure 16). The water content
does not seem to affect the catalytic LA polymerization on SiO2-Al2O3(36). During the thermal reaction,
the observation of bands at 2364, 2349, and 2339 cm–1 is due to the adsorption of CO2 on SiO2-Al2O3,52 which were produced
from the catalytic dehydration of LA. The good chemical stability
of C3H5KO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) illustrated in Figures 14–16 coincides
with the IR spectra of the spent SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported K salt catalyst samples in Figure 10.

Figure 16 IR spectra on the C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) precatalyst after treatments

Herein, it is of interest to correlate the AA yield
and catalytic
stabilities over KNO3, KNO3/SiO2,
and KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36)
with the chemical stabilities of C3H5KO3, C3H5KO3/SiO2, and C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C. As illustrated in Table 1 and Figures 1–3, the orders of both the AA yield and catalytic stability over the
KNO3 systems at 350 °C are ranked as KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) > KNO3/SiO2 > KNO3. As indicated in Figures 13 and 16 and Figure S4, the
order of the chemical
stability of the C3H5KO3 systems
at 350 °C is ranked as C3H5KO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) > C3H5KO3/SiO2 > C3H5KO3. This order is in accordance with the order
of the
IR band intensity of C3H5KO3 on the
spent KNO3, KNO3/SiO2, and KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) catalyst
samples in Figures 8 and 10. The AA yield and catalytic stability
over the KNO3 systems are indeed associated with the chemical
stability of C3H5KO3 in these systems.
A good chemical stability of C3H5KO3 as the possible catalytic active species can ensure a high and stable
conversion of LA to AA.

At this stage, we hypothesize that C3H5KO3 would play the roles of important
intermediate and catalytic
active species in the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA. As stated
above, the transition of C3H5KO3 to
AA does not seem to proceed independently without the attendance of
LA during the reaction process. Although initial C3H5KO3 as the true catalyst is easily formed from
LA and a starting K salt, the regeneration of C3H5KO3 poses a challenge in the catalytic cycle. The regeneration
of C3H5KO3 usually more or less weakens
as the catalytic reaction proceeds. The ability to regenerate C3H5KO3 from LA is related to the actual
activity of a catalyst system and certainly will influence the reaction
rate and LA conversion. The approaches to regenerating C3H5KO3 are likely to involve the reactions of
LA with C3H3KO2 following the C3H5KO3 dehydration step and C3H5KO2 following the C3H3KO2 hydrogenation step. This certainly will affect the
AA and PA yields. To acquire further insights into the reaction pathway
and catalyst deactivation issue with C3H5KO3, we next examined the reactivities of LA with C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 on KBr and SiO2-Al2O3(36).

In Figure 17, the
surface IR spectra observed in the 2500–900 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA and C3H3KO2 on KBr under flowing N2 are shown.
A KBr wafer was impregnated with a drop of aqueous 10% C3H3KO2 solution in air followed by removal of
water under vacuum at 22 °C for 0.5 h. The resultant C3H3KO2/KBr was impregnated with a drop of aqueous
10% LA solution and subsequently treated under flowing N2 at 22 °C for 3 min. At this point, the signature shoulder band
of C3H5KO3 at 1591 cm–1 appeared together with a band of AA at 983 cm–1, indicating the easy formation of C3H5KO3 and AA from LA and C3H3KO2, as shown in Figure 17a. As the reaction was continued, the signature bands of C3H3KO2 at 1636 and 1559 cm–1 and LA at 1726 cm–1 decreased in intensity in
favor of the increase of the band intensity of C3H5KO3. Meanwhile, the shift of the 1726 cm–1 band to 1708 cm–1 implies an increase in the production
of AA during the reaction. At 200 °C, C3H3KO2 almost vanished in favor of the formation of C3H5KO3 (Figure 17d). The results demonstrate that the displacement
of unsupported C3H3KO2 with LA susceptibly
takes place to generate C3H5KO3 and
release AA. When the temperature was further increased, the 1590 cm–1 band shifted toward 1568 cm–1 with
the concurrent reappearance of the features of C3H3KO2. This accounts for that the C3H5KO3 produced from LA and C3H3KO2 is prone to dehydrating to C3H3KO2 at higher temperatures (≥300 °C), in agreement
with the IR results on the spent unsupported K salt catalyst samples
in Figure 8 and the
thermal reactivity of C3H5KO3 on
KBr (see the Supporting Information).

Figure 17 IR spectra after the
reaction of LA and C3H3KO2 on KBr
under flowing N2 at (a) 22 °C for 3 min, (b) 22 °C
for 50 min, (c) 100 °C for 0.5 h, (d) 200 °C for 0.5 h,
(e) 300 °C for 0.5 h, and (f) 350 °C for 0.5 h.

Following the above reaction at 350 °C, the
KBr-supported
product wafer was allowed to further react with LA for testing the
ability to further regenerate C3H5KO3. The IR results are presented in Figure 18. After LA was added onto the wafer followed
by treatment under flowing N2 at 22 °C, the 1568 cm–1 band shifted to 1585 cm–1. This
indicates that C3H5KO3 is regenerated
only partly from the supported product. Increasing the temperature
was unable to produce more C3H5KO3. The dehydration of C3H5KO3 to
C3H3KO2 was carried out again at
higher temperatures (≥300 °C).

h of reaction of LA with the KBr-supported
species shown in Figure 17f under flowing N2 at (a) 22 °C, (b) 100 °C,
(c) 200 °C, (d) 300 °C, and (e) 350 °C.

When a wafer of the KBr-supported spent KNO3 catalyst
sample in 28 h of the vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C
was subjected to reacting with LA, the signature band of C3H3KO2 at 1566 cm–1 was able
to shift to 1575 cm–1 only, as shown in Figure 19. This hints that C3H5KO3 is regenerated even more difficultly from the spent KNO3 catalyst sample. This is also evidence that, with unsupported K
salt catalyst systems, the ability to regenerate C3H5KO3 weakens obviously as the catalytic cycle increases.

of the following treatments on KBr-supported spent KNO3 in 28 h of the vapor-phase dehydration of LA at 350 °C:

for 0.5 h, (c) with LA under flowing N2 at 22 °C for

for 0.5 h.

In Figure 20, the
surface IR spectra recorded in the 2500–900 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA and C3H5KO2 on KBr under flowing N2 are shown.
A KBr wafer was first impregnated with a drop of aqueous 10% C3H5KO2 solution in air followed by removal
of water under vacuum at 22 °C for 0.5 h. Upon impregnation of
the resultant C3H5KO2/KBr with a
drop of aqueous 10% LA solution, the signature band of C3H5KO2 at 1562 cm–1 nearly
vanished, while the signature band of C3H5KO3 at 1590 cm–1 appeared, as seen in Figure 20a. The result suggests
the easy reaction of LA and C3H5KO2 to produce C3H5KO3 and PA: 10  

Figure 20 IR spectra after the
reaction of LA and C3H5KO2 on KBr
under flowing N2 at (a) 22 °C for 5 min, (b) 22 °C
for 0.5 h, (c) 100 °C for 0.5 h, (d) 200 °C for 0.5 h, and
(e) 350 °C for 0.5 h.

The absence of bands of PA may be due to the difficult adsorption
of PA on the surface. The reaction was markedly accelerated when heated
to 100 °C, the 1590 cm–1 band of C3H5KO3 growing at the expense of the 1716 cm–1 band of LA and the 1562 and 1370 cm–1 bands of C3H5KO2, as shown in Figure 20c. When heated
to 200 °C, a nearly pure spectrum of C3H5KO3 was present. The simultaneous presence of a tiny band
at 1760 cm–1 is ascribed to the production of poly(LA)
in trace amounts. As expected, raising the temperature to 350 °C
led to the dehydration of C3H5KO3 to C3H3KO2, as shown by the spectral
change between Figure 20d,e. It follows that the reactivity of LA and C3H5KO2 is similar to that between Figure 20d,e. It follows that the reactivity
of LA and C3H5KO2 is similar to that
of LA and C3H3KO2.

In Figure 21, the
surface IR spectra observed in the 2500–1100 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA and C3H3KO2 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under flowing N2 are shown. A SiO2-Al2O3(36) wafer was impregnated with a drop of aqueous
10% C3H3KO2 solution followed by
removal of water under vacuum at 22 °C for 0.5 h. The resultant
C3H3KO2/SiO2-Al2O3(36) was impregnated with a drop of aqueous 10% LA solution
and subsequently treated under flowing N2 at 22 °C
for 0.5 h. The obtained spectrum contained surface molecular H2O and C3H3KO2 at 1639(m),
1553(s), and 1364(m) cm–1. From this spectrum, LA
has rather low reactivity with C3H3KO2/SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 22 °C. While
the temperature was raised toward 350 °C, the bands of C3H3KO2 at 1639 and 1364 cm–1 gradually fell in intensity, whereas the bands of LA and C3H3KO2 at 1725 and 1553 cm–1 shifted to 1702 and 1612 cm–1, respectively. We
thus reason that the reactivity of LA with C3H3KO2 and the surface Na+ to form C3H5KO3, C3H5NaO3, and AA increases with increasing temperature. After the temperature
had reached 350 °C, the bands of both LA and C3H3KO2 tremendously declined in intensity in favor
of the emergence of bands of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 at 1612(s), 1455(m),
and 1410(m) cm–1. This hints that the displacement
of LA with C3H3KO2 to produce C3H5KO3 and AA is favorable at 350 °C.
The upward shift of the signature band of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 to 1612
cm–1 may be due to the interaction between the lactate
salt and AA on SiO2-Al2O3(36). The
fact that C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 are stably retained on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C shows that C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 dehydrate to C3H3KO2 and C3H3NaO2 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C harder.

flowing N2 at (a) 22 °C, (b) 100 °C,
(c) 200 °C, and (d) 350 °C.

In Figure 22, the
surface IR spectra observed in the 2500–1100 cm–1 region during the thermal reaction of LA and C3H5KO2 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) under flowing N2 are shown. A SiO2-Al2O3(36) wafer was impregnated with a drop of aqueous
10% C3H5KO2 solution followed by
removal of water under vacuum at 22 °C for 0.5 h. The resultant
C3H5KO2/SiO2-Al2O3(36) was impregnated with a drop of aqueous 10% LA solution
and displayed the features of LA at 1725(w) cm–1 and lactate salts around 1615(sh) cm–1 (subsequently
treated under flowing N2 at different temperatures). After 0.5 h of reaction at 22 °C,
the upward shift of the signature band of C3H5KO2 at 1561 cm–1 already occurred, suggesting
that LA and C3H5KO2 already starts
to transform to C3H5KO3 and PA on
SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 22 °C. With
increasing temperature, the band shift kept increasing up to 1604
cm–1 at 350 °C. In the meantime, the signature
band of LA at 1723 cm–1 shifted to 1715 cm–1, hinting the formation of small amounts of AA on the surface. The
observations implicate that LA would catalytically react with C3H5KO2 and the surface Na+ to form C3H5KO3, C3H5NaO3, PA, and AA on SiO2-Al2O3(36) during this process. The existence of the signature
band of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 at 1604 cm–1 after
0.5 h of heating at 350 °C confirms the good chemical stability
of C3H5KO3 and C3H5NaO3 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) at 350 °C. The lack of bands of PA may likewise be due
to the difficult adsorption of PA on the surface. The presence of
the 1604 cm–1 band further assumes that the interaction
between the lactate salt and AA on SiO2-Al2O3(36) would cause an upward shift of the main band of the lactate
salt. It seems that C3H5KO2 is more
reactive with LA than C3H3KO2 on
SiO2-Al2O3(36).

The good thermochemical stability of C3H5KO3 issued from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2 on SiO2-Al2O3(36) stated above virtually reflects
the strong ability to regenerate C3H5KO3 from the supported K salt catalyst systems as the catalytic
reaction proceeds. This matches with the IR results of the spent SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported K salt catalyst
samples in Figure 10.

The combined catalytic and IR studies presented above have
suggestively
established the relationship among LA, C3H5KO3, C3H3KO2, AA, C3H5KO2, and PA in the dehydration process of
LA to AA and PA over the K salt (nitrate, hydroxide, and carbonate)
catalyst systems. We propose a general reaction pathway for the vapor-phase
dehydration of LA to AA with a K salt catalyst system, as depicted
in Scheme 1. In a reaction
from LA over a K salt catalyst system, on principle, the AA yield
is dependent on the catalytic selectivities for both C3H5KO3 dehydration and regeneration steps. Given
a catalytic selectivity for the conversion of LA to AA, the catalytic
stability is related to the ability of the catalyst system to regenerate
C3H5KO3 from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2. In this work, the contrast in the catalytic stability over KNO3, KNO3/SiO2, and KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) is shown to reflect their
distinct abilities to regenerate C3H5KO3 from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2 based on the IR results of the
spent catalyst samples and the reactivity between LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2. The three KNO3 catalyst systems give rise to LA conversion
of 67–97% and selectivity to AA of 35–43% at an initial
stage (5 h). However, only the KNO3/SiO2-Al2O3(36) system behaves well in the catalytic stability
during the reaction on stream because of its strong ability to regenerate
C3H5KO3 from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2. The cause leading to the difference in the activity of C3H5KO3 regeneration from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2 is not clear for the time being. The relevant factors may presumably
involve the catalyst acid–base property, interaction between
K salt and support, dispersion of K salt and catalyst coking, etc.
An in-depth investigation is in progress. Since the production of
AA requires the presence of C3H5KO3, the ability of a K salt catalyst system to regenerate C3H5KO3 from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2 and the
chemical stability of C3H5KO3 under
the catalytic conditions determine the catalytic performance stability
of this system. The poor regeneration ability of C3H5KO3 affects the reaction rate, LA conversion, and
AA yield. Both easy decomposition of C3H5KO3 and the consumption of LA via other pathways are responsible
for low AA yields.

Scheme 1 Proposed Reaction Pathway for the Vapor-Phase Dehydration
of LA to
AA with a K Salt Catalyst System
In the case with an unsupported or SiO2-supported
K
salt as a precatalyst, the step of the C3H3KO2-to-AA conversion with the regeneration of C3H5KO3 via the displacement of C3H3KO2 with LA proceeds more slowly than the C3H5KO3-to-C3H3KO2 conversion step via dehydration at 350 °C, as demonstrated
by the IR observations (Figures 8 and 17–19). C3H5KO2 could be more
readily formed via C3H3KO2 hydrogenation
to give PA eventually. The steps of formation of AA and PA from C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2, respectively, are believed to be rate-limiting. In
the case with a SiO2(36)-Al2O3-supported
K salt as a precatalyst, the step of the C3H5KO3-to-C3H3KO2 conversion
proceeds more slowly than the step of the C3H3KO2-to-AA conversion with the regeneration of C3H5KO3 at 350 °C, as shown by the IR results
(Figures 10 and 21). The displacement of C3H3KO2 with LA could go more rapidly, and the formation of
C3H5KO2 and PA could get suppressed.
The C3H5KO3-to-C3H3KO2 conversion step is assumed to be rate-limiting.
In both cases, C3H5KO3 is suggested
to be the true catalytic active species and an important intermediate
for the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA.

4 Conclusions
K or Na salt catalyst systems (nitrate, hydroxide,
and carbonate)
enable the vapor-phase dehydration of LA to AA to proceed predominantly
via a pathway with the lactate salt intermediate. The unsupported
K salt systems give rise to LA conversion and selectivity to AA of
∼70 and ∼35%, respectively. The SiO2-supported
K salt systems exhibit increased LA conversion and decreased selectivity
to PA and similar selectivity to AA. Nevertheless, these two types
of systems are catalytically unstable and deactivate seriously in
the reaction on stream. The SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported K salt systems display the fairly stable catalytic
performance in 90 h of reaction, in which the LA conversion and selectivity
to AA reach more than 75 and 40%, respectively, and the selectivity
to PA remains <7.0% at a WHSVLA value of 1.8 h–1.

The distinction in the catalytic stability consists in the
distinction
in the chemical stability of C3H5KO3 and the activity for the regeneration of C3H5KO3 from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2 over the different catalyst
systems. With the unsupported and SiO2-supported K salt
systems, the in situ generated C3H5KO3 readily transforms to C3H3KO2 and
C3H5KO2 as the stable species under
the reaction conditions. C3H5KO3 is
difficultly regenerated from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2. Since C3H3KO2 and C3H5KO2 are not important reaction intermediates for the production
of AA, their formation affects the catalytic activity and selectivity.
With the SiO2-Al2O3(36)-supported
K salt systems, the in situ-formed C3H5KO3 is well stabilized under the reaction conditions. C3H5KO3 is easily regenerated from LA and C3H3KO2 or C3H5KO2. In all the three cases, C3H5KO3 acts as the catalytic active species and an important reaction
intermediate for the production of AA.
