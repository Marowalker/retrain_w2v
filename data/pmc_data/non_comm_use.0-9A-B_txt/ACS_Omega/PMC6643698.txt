The
ability of ceria to break H2 in the absence of noble
metals has prompted a number of studies because of its potential applications
in many technological fields. Most of the theoretical works reported
in the literature are focused on the most stable (111) termination.
However, recently, the possibility of stabilizing ceria particles
with selected terminations has opened new avenues to explore. In the
present paper, we investigate the role of termination in H2 dissociation on stoichiometric ceria. We model (111)-, (110)-, and
(100)-terminated slabs together with the stepped (221) and (331) surfaces.
Our results support a dissociation mechanism proceeding via the formation
of a hydride/hydroxyl CeH/OH intermediate. Both the stability of such
an intermediate and the activation energy depend critically on the
termination, the (100)-terminated surfaces being the most reactive:
the activation energy is 0.16 eV, and the CeH/OH intermediate is stable
by −0.64 eV for the (100) slab, whereas the (111) slab presents
0.75 and 0.74 eV, respectively. We provide structural, energetic,
electronic, and spectroscopic data, as well as chemical descriptors
correlating structure, energy, and reactivity, to guide in the theoretical
and experimental characterization of the Ce–H surface intermediate.

1 Introduction
Ceria
has attracted much attention in the last years because of
its numerous technological application fields such as heterogeneous
catalysis,1,2 where it can be used as a catalyst itself3−6 or as a support,7−13 treatment of toxic gases and pollutants,14,15 solid oxide fuel cells,16,17 oxygen sensors,18−20 and biomedicine.21,22 Pure ceria has been successfully
used in alkyne semihydrogenation reactions5,23−25 with high activity and selectivity to the alkene
products. The unexpected ability of ceria to dissociate hydrogen opens
new directions for the use of this promising material, in particular
in the field of heterogeneous catalysis where the absence of noble
metal particles involves tremendous economic advantages. These last
years, H2 dissociation on ceria has been of great interest
both experimentally24−31 and theoretically.24,25,27,32−37 If it is well-established that the product of hydrogenation in ceria
leads to stable hydroxylated surfaces,30,34,36,38 then the mechanism
was found to proceed through a hydride intermediate: H2 dissociates on ceria according to a heterolytic pathway (forming
a hydride/hydroxyl pair), followed by the transfer of a H atom that
finally yields the homolytic product (forming two hydroxyl groups
and reducing two cerium atoms). In particular, García-Melchor
and López34 and Fernández-Torre
et al.36 find that the H–H bond
break on (111)-CeO2 proceeds via the formation of a metastable
intermediate Ce–H/Ce–OH, which is ∼0.7 eV higher
in energy compared to H2 molecular adsorption. Therefore,
understanding the dissociation mechanism of H2 on ceria
becomes crucial not only to rationalize the elementary steps involved,
but also for the development of materials with selected properties
such as heterogeneous catalysts. Heterolytic bond break pathways are
commonly associated in the literature to irreducible oxides,39,40 and the fact that they drive the H2 dissociation in ceria
opens new avenues to explore.

Recently, some of us37 have conducted
a detailed analysis of the dissociation mechanism on ceria and gallia-promoted
ceria catalysts by a multitechnique approach involving X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), infrared (IR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR),
microkinetic modeling and density functional theory (DFT). Our results
show that the formation of an intermediate CeH/OH pair is consistent
with the activation energy deduced from the experimental measurements,
whereas a direct dissociation to the final hydroxylated product is
not supported by the data. In the mechanism proposed, the formation
of Ce–H hydride species is the key step. Such species were
not observed in ceria by IR spectroscopy;25,28,37 on the contrary, Ga–H species are
clearly identified in the doped materials in the same set of experiments37 and also in other experiments41,42 and are associated to lower activation barriers for the hydrogenation
reaction. H2 dissociation was also studied on ceria-supported
gold nanoparticles, where it has been shown that H2 dissociates
according to a heterolytic pathway, leading to the formation of Au–H
and O–H species.43

In all
the theoretical works cited above, the most stable (111)
termination of ceria is considered as model for the mechanistic studies
of H2 dissociation. In standard conditions and under thermodynamic
equilibrium, ceria particles will expose mostly the facets corresponding
to the most stable surfaces, whereas the other terminations will count
for a small fraction of the surface particle. Thus, octahedral nanoparticles
expose mostly (111) facets that can be truncated depending on the
external conditions.44−46 However, other terminations of ceria are experimentally
accessible, such as (100) which is predominant in nanocubes,29,47−55 (110) in nanorods,52−58 and the most common (111) in nano-octahedra29,52−55 ceria particles. In the present study, the roles of surface termination
as well as surface topology in the H2 bond break mechanism
were investigated, showing in particular that the Ce–H species
can be stabilized, leading to a decrease in the activation barrier
of H2 break. In particular, we have shown that a careful
selection of the surface termination can decrease up to 5 times the
activation barrier. This study focuses on stoichiometric surfaces,
and the reduced surfaces will be addressed in future works. The (100),
(110), and (111) surfaces were investigated, together with the stepped
(221) and (331) ones, which were also reported to be stable.59 Our results suggest that the (100)-terminated
surfaces are the most efficient to break the H–H bond, with
a barrier as low as 0.16 eV. Besides, the heterolytic dissociation
product (O–H and Ce–H species) on these surfaces is
found to be thermodynamically stable (between −0.20 and −0.64
eV), and we provide computed IR spectra as well as temperature effects
(Gibbs free energies) that may guide the experimentalists in the search
of the characterization of this important intermediate.

The
present paper is organized as follows. The results for the
bare slabs and their interaction with H2 are presented,
followed by the electronic structure analysis and the effect of temperature.
The use of reactivity descriptors is discussed. The conclusions raised
and the methodology employed are presented at the end of the paper.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Bare Slabs
The
seven surface models
used are depicted in Figure 1. From a structural point of view, (100)-Ce, (110), and (111)
are terminated by threefold-coordinated oxygens, and the (100)-O-(a)/(b)
slabs show twofold-coordinated oxygens. The coordination number of
surface cerium sites in (100)-Ce is fourfold; in (100)-O-(a)/(b) and
(110), it is sixfold, and in (111), it is sevenfold-coordinated. The
step sites are characterized by threefold-coordinated oxygen and sixfold-coordinated
cerium (Figure 1 and Table 1).

sites are shown by a blue square and a purple rectangle, respectively.

2.2 H2 Dissociation
A mechanism
involving different steps is schematized in Figure 2, and the calculated energies are reported
in Table 2. First,
the H2 molecule physisorbs at an oxygen site (R1) and is
preactivated, with a small polarization, as can be seen in Table 4. In a second step,
the H–H bond is broken according to a heterolytic path leading
to a metastable state, labeled MS, and achieved after a process (R2′),
that evolves spontaneously, that is, without an energetic barrier,
to the product of the heterolytic dissociation through the process
(R2″). The product is a pair formed by a hydride bound to the
Ce site and a proton bound to O, labeled (H+, H–). For the (100) surfaces, H2 dissociates directly without
MS, via the process (R2). Finally, because of the strong exothermicity
of the formation of hydroxyls, we consider the product of the homolytic
dissociation with the diffusion of one H atom to an oxygen site to
form two hydroxyl groups—process (R3).

of the different steps involved in the
heterolytic dissociation pathway. The species are labeled as follows:
H2 physisorbed as H2*, metastable state as MS, hydride–proton
pair from the heterolytic product as (H+, H–), and the homolytic product as (OH, OH).

2.2.1 Structure
and Energetics
The energetic
profile of H2 dissociation is summarized in Table 2, where all adsorption energies
are referenced to the energy of H2(g) and CeO2 surface and were calculated according to  

To the best of our knowledge, the activation
energy of H2 dissociation was only reported for the most
stable (111) termination. Our results for this surface, and in particular
our activation energy (0.75 eV), are in perfect agreement with the
ones reported by Fernández-Torre et al.36 (0.76 eV), García-Melchor and López34 (0.85 eV), Negreiros et al.33 (0.72 eV), and Werner et al.25 (0.78 eV). The activation energy increases in the series: (100)-O-(b)
< (100)-Ce < (100)-O-(a) < (110) < (221) < (331) <
(111) (Figure 3 and Table 2). These results show
that the (111) termination exhibits the worst catalytic properties
for H2 dissociation in the series and that it would be
possible to reduce up to 5 times the energetic barrier by using (100)-O-
or Ce-terminated surfaces instead of (111). For the (100) surface,
it is important to note that the recent work of Capdevila-Cortada
and López65 has shown that the structural
configuration of surface oxygen depends on the temperature. The (100)-O-(a)
model is the most stable configuration and hence the most probable
at low temperature (<100 K). However, for higher temperatures,
the other configurations of surface oxygen can be accessible, and
their probabilities increase with the temperature. Because these surfaces
are less stable than the first one, their reactivity is expected to
be higher, that is, with a smaller activation energy, as it was found
in the (100)-O-(b) model.

Figure 3 Energetic profile (in eV) for the heterolytic
dissociation of H2 molecule on CeO2 surfaces.

From an energetic point of view,
the surfaces can be distinguished
according to two groups: group I made of (100)-Ce, (100)-O-(a), and
(100)-O-(b) terminations and group II regrouping (110) and (111) as
well as step models (221) and (331). Group I and group II differ according
to (i) the stabilization of the dissociation product (H+, H–) and (ii) the existence of an MS. Indeed,
the surfaces of group I show a negative reaction energy (−0.20
to −0.64 eV), reflecting the fact that (H+, H–) is thermodynamically favored, whereas the surfaces
of group II lead to an endothermic reaction (0.34–0.77 eV).
The forward activation energy required to form the (H+,
H–) intermediate lies between 0.16 and 0.35 eV for
group I and between 0.53 and 0.75 eV for group II. Moreover, the backward
activation energies for the surfaces of group II are quite small (between
0.01 and 0.11 eV), indicating the easiest reversibility of H2 dissociation on these surfaces as opposed to group I surfaces that
have large backward energetic barriers because of a better stabilization
of (H+, H–). Furthermore, only the surfaces
of group II pass through an MS state during H2 dissociation.
For the sake of completeness, the stability of the final OH/OH product
is found to be −2.35 to −3.85 eV for group I and −2.18
to −3.19 eV for group II. This indicates a clear driving force
for the formation of hydroxylated surfaces accompanied by a reduction
of Ce4+ to Ce3+. The barrier for this process
is reported for the (111) termination to be of 0.26 eV,37 indicating a possible rapid, irreversible evolution
of the hydride intermediate to the hydroxylated product, which is
2.84 eV more stable.

An analysis of the transition structure
(TS) geometry shows similarities
among the terminations (see Table 3 and Figure 4 that illustrate the case of the (110) termination). In TS,
the H2 molecule is elongated, pointing to a Ce and an O
in the surface. The distances H–H, Ce–H, and O–H
are intermediate between the H2* and (H+, H–)
intermediates: H–H distances span from 0.940 to 1.153 Å;
Ce–H distances span from 2.434 to 2.647 Å, and O–H
values span from 1.243 to 1.353 Å depending on their coordinations.
Interestingly we found a relationship between the TS geometry and
the related activation energy. More precisely, TS of low energy is
associated to a geometry close to the H2* state (short H–H bonds and large
Ce–H and O–H distances; Figure 5) and correspond to group I, that is, the
(100)-terminated models.

green isosurfaces show an electronic density gain and depletion, respectively.

2.2.2 Electronic Structure
From an electronic
point of view, the different steps involved in H2 dissociation
were clearly identified in the density of states (DOS). All the structures
show similar features, and we display (100)-O-(b) and (331) in Figure 6, with the projections
on the Ce–H and O–H atoms for the sake of clarity. The
projections on all the Ce, O, and H atoms are presented in the Supporting Information. First, H2 physisorption
leads to the appearance of a narrow H2 molecular band in
the valence region. In TS, the splitting of this H2 band
into Hδ+ and Hδ− bands is
observed. More precisely, the proton and hydride states are confined
in two distinct regions, for all the surfaces studied. Indeed, although
the position of the Hδ+ band is localized around
−6 eV/EFermi, the Hδ− band is shifted to higher energies. More interestingly, only the
surfaces of group I show an overlap between the TS and the slab bands.
It has been shown that this overlap allows for a reduction in the
transition structure energy in metals for the hydrogen evolution reaction.66 Our results point in the same direction: the
surfaces of group I show smaller activation energy and overlap between
the levels of H2 in TS, whereas the surfaces of group II
exhibit larger activation barriers, with no overlapping observed.
For the product of dissociation (H+, H–), the hydride band becomes the highest occupied energy level. The
main consequence is the increase of the Fermi level of the system.
Also, the overlap between the oxygen (cerium) and H+ (H–) states indicates the presence of O–H+ (Ce–H–) bonds.

pair (H+, H–) for the (100)-O-(b) (left)
and (331) (right) surfaces.
Only the cerium and oxygen bonds to hydrogen are projected. The PDOS
of cerium, oxygen, hydrogen molecule, hydride (×3), and proton
(×3) are depicted in blue, red, gray, fuchsia, and green, respectively.
PDOS are given in arbitrary units, and the Fermi level is depicted
with a dashed line.

Different behaviors between
the group I and group II surfaces were
observed. In particular, the surfaces of group I (with a small activation
energy) show no or a slight increase in the Fermi energy during the
dissociation (Figure 6), contrary to the surfaces of group II (requiring a large energetic
barrier) which involve a significant increase in the Fermi energy
(Figure 6). More details
can be found in the Supporting Information, together with the projected density of states. Moreover, although
the surface cerium atom shows very similar bands, oxygens can be differentiated
in function of their structural configuration: twofold coordinated
oxygens present a narrow peak around −5.5 eV/EFermi after H2 dissociation, whereas the peak
is located near −6.5 eV/EFermi for
threefold coordinated oxygen.

Bader charges analysis (Table 4) indicates the electronic transfer
during the dissociation process: first (H2* species), a preactivation of H2 molecule with a slight polarization of H–H bond is observed.
In the TS species, the polarization of the H–H bond increases,
leading to the formation of a tight ion pair, and finally, the system
evolves to the formation of a hydride and proton, well-identified
with their Bader charges: (H+, H–) species.
Moreover, the oxygen involved in the formation of the hydroxyl group
shows an important electron gain: approximately +0.5|e–| with respect to the same oxygen in the slab.

2.2.3 Effect
of Temperature
The effect
of temperature on the energetic profile was considered by calculating
Gibbs free energies for T = 300 K (Table 2). First, we note that temperature
affects the stability of a species, and more precisely, the increase
of the temperature goes along with the destabilization of all the
adsorbed species. Indeed, at 300 K, a shift toward higher energy is
observed: around +0.45 for TS; +0.50 for H2*, MS, and (H+, H–); and approximately +0.70 eV for (OH, OH). Therefore, the consideration
of both enthalpy and entropy contributions shows that the heterolytic
product (H+, H–) is only stabilized,
that is, with a negative adsorption energy, on the (100)-Ce surface,
whereas, without taking into account the temperature, this species
was stable on the (100)-O-(a), (100)-O-(b), and (100)-Ce terminations.
Although temperature induces very small changes (less than ±0.04
eV) in reaction energies, it reduces systematically forward and backward
activation energies up to 0.09 eV. This decrease of the energetic
barrier comes from the stronger destabilizing effect on H2* and (H+, H–) than on TS (Table 2). Indeed, the imaginary frequency of the
transition structure is not taken into account in the Gibbs free energy
calculation, resulting in lower vibrational effects for the transition
state. Moreover, at 300 K, for the (110), (111), (221), and (331)
slabs characterized by a smooth potential energy surface between the
TS and (H+, H–) states, the transition
structure becomes more stable, that is, with a smaller adsorption
energy, than the heterolytic product (H+, H–). This could indicate, as suggested by Negreiros et al.,33 that H2 dissociation on ceria surfaces
follows different pathways (from a reaction coordinate point of view)
related to temperature.

2.2.4 IR Spectra
The
vibrational frequencies
and IR spectra of the H2 dissociation product (H+, H–) were computed for all the surfaces studied,
except for (111) where the IR spectrum modeled corresponds to the
MS because of the absence of the (H+, H–) state. The vibrational modes are distributed in three distinct
regions (Figure 7):
O–H and Ce–H bending are characterized by low frequencies
(between 450 and 900 cm–1), Ce–H stretching
modes are comprised between 950 and 1250 cm–1, and
O–H stretching shows higher frequencies with the wavenumbers
in the range of 3100–3900 cm–1. The wavenumbers
and their relative intensities are given in Table 5.

Intensities are given in arbitrary units.

For all the surfaces studied, the ν(Ce–H)
vibration
shows systematically the highest intensity. To the best of our knowledge,
there is no experimental observation reported for the Ce–H
vibrational mode. Previous works of Wu et al.28 on CeO2 and CeH3 as well as a recent review
of Copéret et al.67 on surface hydrides
suggest that Ce–H vibrations are expected in the IR spectral
region in the range of 1500–2000 cm–1. According
to our results, this hydride–cerium stretch region is found
between 900 and 1300 cm–1. However, from an experimental
point of view, the observation of this hydride vibrational mode is
not straightforward, first because of the poor stability of the (H+, H−) product, and second because this is
also the vibrational region of other adsorbed molecules as methoxide
species (ν(C−O) stretching mode).68,69 As regards the ν(O–H) vibrations, the wavenumbers are
in good agreement with previous experimental28,30,31,69,70 and theoretical25,35 works, showing
a peak in the region between 2700 and 3800 cm–1 as
reported by Lustemberg et al.71 The only
exception is the (111) MS with a lower wavenumber (ν(O–H)
= 1769.3 cm–1). Note that the presence of hydrogen
bonds on the (100)-Ce and (110) surfaces reduces significantly the
wavenumber of O–H stretching, which is in line with similar
observations on the (111) surfaces previously reported by Lustemberg
et al.71 and Fernández-Torre et
al.,72 and explains the wide region observed
for O–H stretching.

2.3 Descriptors
of Reactivity
Capdevila-Cortada
et al.73,74 have defined some reactivity descriptors
for ceria. For H2 dissociation, these descriptors were
based on the basicity of oxygens [with the position of the O (2p)
band] and on the reduction energy. We have explored the correlation
between the structural and electronic parameters to derive descriptors
that account for reactivity. We found that the activation energy displays
a linear correlation with (i) the bond length between the cerium and
oxygen surface sites in the bare relaxed slab and (ii) the difference
in the Fermi energy between the dissociation product (H+, H–) and the bare slab. Indeed, a short Ce–O
distance is associated with a small energetic barrier (Figure 8) and is compatible with the
TS structure with a low activation energy, as discussed in Section 2.2.1. Besides,
a low activation energy is observed when the Fermi energy of the product
(H+, H–) is close to the one of the slab
(Figure 9), which is
consistent with an overlapping of the TS levels of H– with the slab, as happens in metals with the H evolution reaction.66

3 Conclusions
In summary, we have shown
that the topology of the surface plays
a crucial role in H2 dissociation on ceria. In particular,
the (100)-terminated surfaces reduce up to 5 times the activation
energy, from 0.75 eV (111) to 0.16 eV (100). Moreover, these surfaces
lead to the stabilization of the heterolytic product, forming pairs
of hydride/proton species that are found to be thermodynamically stable
in the (100)-terminated slabs. Harmonic IR vibrational spectra of
the product were also computed showing the expected vibrational region
of hydride species on ceria surfaces in the region of 900–1300
cm–1. Finally, we have shown that both the Ce–O
bond length and Fermi energy can be used as the descriptors of reactivity
for prediction purposes.

4 Methods and Models
4.1 Methods
All our calculations were
based on the DFT framework combined with the projector augmented wave
method,75,76 as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation
package77−80 (VASP)—version 5.4.4. The core electrons were kept frozen
and replaced by pseudopotentials (standard pseudopotentials for cerium
and hydrogen and soft one for oxygen), whereas valence electrons (Ce:
4f15s25p65d16s2; O: 2s22p4; and H: 1s1) were expanded
in a set of plane-wave basis functions with a kinetic energy cutoff
of 300 eV. The generalized gradient approximation81 approach was used for the exchange and correlation potential
with the Perdew–Burke–Erzenhof (PBE) functional.82,83 Dispersion forces were not considered because a previous work of
Fernández-Torre et al.36 has shown
that they can be neglected for hydrogen in interaction with ceria.
On-site Coulomb interaction corrections (DFT + U)
following the Dudarev et al. approach84,85 were employed
for the cerium 4f electrons to partially correct for the self-interaction
error. Ueff was set to 5.0 eV for the
cerium 4f orbitals, in line with the previous works using typical U values in the range of 3.0–5.5 eV.32,60,86−93 The Brillouin zone was sampled with the Monkhorst–Pack94k-point mesh with the k-points spaced 0.05 Å–1. The energies
were converged to 10–4 eV in the self-consistent
field and a conjugate-gradient algorithm was used to relax the atomic
position until the forces acting on each atom were less than 0.01
eV/Å. Spin-polarized (unrestricted formalism) calculations were
performed for open-shell systems. Bader charge analysis95−98 was performed to analyze the electron and spin densities.61−63

The transition-structure (TS) structures were located by employing
climbing image nudged elastic band (CI-NEB) algorithm.99,100 A minimum of four images along the reaction pathway with a spring
constant between the images set to 5.0 eV/Å2 and a
convergence threshold on the forces acting on each ion of 0.02 eV/Å
were used for all the CI-NEB calculations. Then, in a second step,
the TS structures were refined by using the improved dimer method.101,102

Frequency calculations were performed (i) on each optimized
structure
to check that the related structures match to a minimum, (ii) and
on each TS structure where only one imaginary frequency was obtained,
demonstrating that the related TS structure correspond to a first-order
saddle point. They were carried out with the finite displacement method
as implemented in VASP. The Hessian matrix is determined from the
harmonic force constants calculated as the numerical derivatives,
with the atomic displacements set to ±0.015 Å. Only the
top two atomic layers and the adsorbate were allowed to be displaced
during the vibrational frequency run, with a threshold of 10–6 eV in the ionic loop. Harmonic frequencies and their associated
normal modes were obtained by the diagonalization of the Hessian matrix,
obtaining an accurate reproduction of low-energy vibrational modes
(in the 500–1000 cm–1 range) and O–H
stretching.103

The IR vibrational
intensities, Ik, are
proportional to the square of the first derivative
of the dipole moment along the z-direction, dμz/dQk. Thus, the IR intensities were evaluated for each vibrational
normal mode according to  where i is the ith eigenvector,  is the mass-weighted coordinate matrix,
μz is the dipole moment along z, and ri is
the atomic Cartesian coordinate.

Zero-point energy (ZPE) was
calculated as follows  where νN is the frequency associated to the vibrational normal mode N.

Moreover, the effect of temperature was considered
by calculating
the Gibbs free energy: G = H – TS. If we assume that the expansion term pV in H = U + pV is negligible, which is a reasonable approximation in solid state,104,105 then the Gibbs free energy can be approximated as the Helmholtz
free energy  

Therefore, for an adsorption system, a common and reasonable
approximation
is to consider only the vibrational contributions in the partition
function,104−106 leading to the following expressions for
internal energy and entropy: U(T) = EDFT + EZPE + Uvib(T) and S(T) = Svib(T), respectively. More details about the thermostatistic
equations used and the Gibbs free energy calculation can be found
in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Slab Models
Ceria is a semiconductor
material crystallizing in a cubic fluorite structure (Fm3m). The optimized cell parameter a calculated with PBE + U (U = 5
eV) was slightly overestimated by about 1.5% (aPBE+U = 5.495 Å) compared to the experimental
value107,108 (aexp = 5.411
Å) but is in good agreement with previous similar theoretical
studies60,89,91,109,110 and was used to build
the slab models. The three stoichiometric low Miller index surfaces
as well as step models were investigated: type I (110); type II (111),
(221), and (331); and type III (100) according to Tasker classification.111 Because the type III surfaces have a nonzero
dipole moment normal to the surface, half of the surface atoms were
moved to the bottom part to quench the dipole moment. The (100) surface
can be O- or Ce-terminated. If it is well-known that the O-terminated
surface is more stable than the Ce-terminated one,64 recently Capdevila-Cortada and López65 have reported the complexity of the (100) surface.
In this context, we have built three models for this termination:
one model for Ce termination—(100)-Ce; and two models for O
termination—(100)-O-(a) and (100)-O-(b) (Figure 1). Supercells were chosen to have surface
models with approximately the same surface area (see Table 1). The slab thickness was chosen
to converge the surface energy for each termination within 5 ×
10–3 J m–2 (see the Supporting Information for further details).
The vacuum layer thickness was set to 15 Å for all the slabs
to avoid interactions between images. In the first step, the bare
slab built by cutting the CeO2 bulk was fully relaxed,
and in the second step the adsorbate and the top-half slab were relaxed,
keeping the bottom-half slab frozen. The main characteristics (geometry,
atom coordination, and surface energy) of the seven slabs are shown
in Table 1, and the
models used are given in the Supporting Information.
