Ab initio calculations of fully O-sulfated
model monosaccharides, including common hexoses (glucose, galactose,
fucose, and mannose) and pentoses (arabinose and xylose), were performed
to study the energetic properties of the recently discovered pyranoside-into-furanoside
(PIF) rearrangement. It was shown that the per-O-sulfated derivatives
of furanoside isomers generally had lower energies than the corresponding
per-O-sulfated pyranosides, while nonsulfated furanosides were always
less favored than nonsulfated pyranosides. Mannose, which is known
to be unreactive in PIF rearrangement, was the only exception. The
results of the theoretical calculations were confirmed by experimental
studies of monosaccharide models and explained the driving force of
such unusual ring contraction process as PIF rearrangement. The conclusions
of performed investigation can be used for prediction of new substrates
applicability for PIF rearrangement.

Introduction
It is well known that
furanosides are generally less thermodynamically stable than the corresponding
pyranosides.1,2 In an acid-promoted Fischer reaction,
furanosides are formed as the kinetic products, whereas thermodynamic
equilibrium predominantly results in the formation of pyranosides.3 The conversion between pyranosides and furanosides
containing a substituent at the anomeric position is complicated;
however, it is possible under enzymatic conditions. For example, mutase
enzymes catalyze the transformation of uridine diphosphate galactopyranose
(UDP-Galp, 1) into the corresponding galactofuranose
(UDP-Galf, 2) (Scheme 1A). However, the equilibrium concentration in the latter
process is only 5%.4

Scheme 1 Examples of PIF Rearrangements:
(A) Conversion of UDP-Galp into UDP-Galf by UDP-Galactopyranose Mutase;4 (B) Equilibrium between Pyranoside and Furanoside
in N-Acetylgalactosamine;5 and (C) PIF Rearrangement under Acid-Promoted Per-O-Sulfation Conditions6
Certain substituents at C-2 also facilitate the acid-promoted
conversion between the pyranoside and furanoside forms. For example, N-acetylgalactosamine (3) under mild acidic
conditions gives 5% of isomeric furanoside 4 (Scheme 1B). The same ratio
of monosaccharides 3 and 4 can be reached
by acid treatment of furanoside 4. The participation
of the acetyl group was proposed as a key step in the mechanism facilitating
the endocyclic cleavage of the O(5)–C(1) bond.5

The analogous participation of the 2-O-sulfonato
group plays a key role in pyranoside-into-furanoside (PIF) rearrangement
(Scheme 1C) under the
acid-promoted per-O-sulfation conditions23,24 that were discovered in 2014.6,7 Unlike the previous
examples, the PIF rearrangement gives predominantly furanoside products.
This process was already successfully used in the syntheses of oligosaccharides
related to Aspergillus galactomannan,8−10Enterococcus diheteroglycan,11 galactan I from Klebsiella pneumoniae,12 and some others.13

In our previous investigations, the kinetic aspects
of PIF rearrangements were studied, including ab initio calculations
of the activation energies of monosaccharides with gluco, galacto,
fuco, and manno configurations.6,7 Additionally, there
was a study by Satoh et al. reporting the importance of the conformational
strain caused by protecting groups for the endocyclic cleavage reaction.14 In this work, we studied the energetic aspects
of PIF rearrangements, which revealed for the first time the driving
force of the nontrivial chemical process of ring contraction. Ab initio
calculations were used to explore the relative stability of the corresponding
pyranoside and furanoside forms of pentoses and hexoses depending
on the presence or absence of sulfate groups on the structures.

Results
and Discussion
Experimentally, it was previously demonstrated7 that in the case of β-galactosides and
β-fucosides, the PIF rearrangement proceeds irreversibly until
the initially formed fully O-sulfated pyranosides are completely consumed.
Thus, allyl galactoside 5 and allyl fucoside 8 under PIF rearrangement conditions give corresponding furanosides 7 and 9, and no traces of the initially formed
per-O-sulfated allyl pyranosides 6 and 10 were detected in the reaction mixture after 24 h (Table 1, entries 1–2).7 On the other hand, propyl α- and β-mannopyranosides 11 and 14 under the same conditions gave only
per-O-sulfated pyranosides 12 and 15, and
no traces of proposed furanoside products 13 and 16 were found. The behavior of these mannosides is probably
determined by the axial orientation of the OH group at C-2.

Table 1 Acid-Promoted Sulfationa of
Galacto-, Fuco-, Manno-, Gluco-, Arabino- and Xylo-Pyranosides
a Standard conditions for PIF rearrangement were used for
all experiments: (1) Py·SO3 (5 equiv/OH-group), HSO3Cl (2 equiv/OH-group), and dimethylformamide (DMF), 25 °C;
and (2) NaHCO3 (aq).

Glucose represented a rather complicated case. Previous experiments
on PIF rearrangements of allyl β-d-glucopyranoside
resulted in the formation of a mixture of the pyranoside and furanoside,
and complete transformation of the glucopyranoside into the furanoside
required a long reaction time7 that caused
the formation of undesirable degradation products. To determine if
this was due to thermodynamic or kinetical reasons, in the present
work, a more reactive propyl β-d-glucopyranoside (17) was used, as the relative rate of the PIF rearrangement
of propyl glycosides was shown to be generally higher.7 Indeed, during 24 h, the initially formed fully O-sulfated
propyl β-d-glucopyranoside 19 was consumed
to give furanoside 18 in 75% NMR yield.

The presence
of CH2OR or CH3 groups at C(5) of the hexoses
anchors the conformation and may significantly influence the relative
stability of the monosaccharide forms. Therefore, along with hexosides,
the PIF rearrangements of pentosides 20 and 23 were also included in this study. The reactivity of pentosides was
higher than that of hexosides and can be accompanied by aglycon cleavage
as a side reaction. Thus, methyl α-l-arabinopyranoside 20 was completely transformed into α-l-arabinofuranoside 21 as the key product in 2 h while no pyranoside 22 was observed in the NMR spectra (Figure 1). In the case of methyl β-d-xylopyranoside 23, the transformation into methyl β-d-xylofuranoside 24 was completed in 5 h.

Figure 1 Part of the 1H NMR spectra of the reaction mixtures: (A) per-O-sulfation
of methyl α-l-arabinofuranoside 20 (10
min); (B) acid-promoted PIF rearrangement is almost complete after
2 h, and the signals of initially formed pyranoside 22 have almost disappeared.

For the α-l-arabinoside model structure (entries
1 and 2), the lowest energy conformers15 were considered for the pyranoside form (4C1 for the nonsulfated form and 1C4 for the per-O-sulfated
form) and EO for the furanoside. The complete sulfation
causes the furanoside form to be 2.5 kcal/mol more preferable than
α-arabinopyranoside. The same situation was observed for the
β-d-xyloside model (entries 3 and 4): the pyranoside
form tended to adopt an inverted chair 1C4 (Figure 2) conformation upon
the introduction of sulfates, and the furanoside form became dominant
over the pyranoside. This, in our opinion, is the basis for the driving
force of the isomerization as the final step of the studied PIF rearrangement
process.

Figure 2 Chair (4C1 and 1C4) and
skewed (0S2, 3S1 and 1S5) conformations of per-O-sulfated β-glucosides
and β-xylosides and their relative energies (kcal/mol). The
energies of the lowest energy conformations (1C4 for xylose and 0S2 for glucose) were taken
as zero.

A similar preference for the furanoside
forms in the case of per-O-sulfated monosaccharides was revealed for
the three studied hexosides with β-d-galacto (entries
5 and 6), β-l-fuco (entries 7 and 8), and β-d-gluco configurations (entries 9 and 10). The previous NMR
studies15 reveal that manno- and galacto-pyranosides
exist mostly in normal chair configuration 4C1, whereas for the per-O-sulfated β-glucosides, the skewed conformer 0S2 is dominant (Figure 2). The conformers observed in the NMR spectra
had the lowest energies in the ab initio calculations and were used
to estimate the relative stability of the corresponding conformers.

These data clearly indicate that in the unsubstituted forms of
all the studied hexoses, the pyranoside isomers are preferable by
several kcal/mol. However, upon the introduction of sulfate substituents,
the situation is reversed, and the furanoside isomers become more
energetically stable, which provides the driving force for the isomerization
of per-O-sulfated pyranosides into corresponding furanosides.

The only exceptions are the cases of α- and β-d-mannosides (entries 11–14). In these examples, the pyranoside
form is the dominant form for both free and per-O-sulfated compounds,
but in the β-isomers, this favorability is less pronounced.
This might also account for the fact that in the course of our studies
of the PIF rearrangement, we failed to find conditions under which
either α- or β-mannosides could be transformed into the
furanoside form.

The origin of such a change in the furanoside/pyranoside
preference clearly lies in the repulsive interactions between the
bulky and charged sulfate groups (Figure 3). The presence of these interactions in
highly sulfated carbohydrates and their ability to influence the conformation
of carbohydrate rings was confirmed previously.15−17 However, in
the furanoside form, one of the sulfates is expelled from the ring
and moves to the side chain, which gives it more degrees of freedom
and allows it to avoid unfavorable interactions with the ring sulfates.
In mannosides, these repulsions are decreased because the O-2 and
O-3 sulfates are ax/eq oriented. In the α-mannosides, additionally,
the ax/ax orientation of the aglycon and O-2 sulfate reduces the repulsion;
thus, these sugars exhibit a stronger preference for the pyranoside
form, especially their α-anomers. To prove this hypothesis,
NCE energies were computed for all the sulfated molecules in this
work using NBO 6.0 software.18 The results
given in Table 2 indicate
that for the sulfated pentoses, the NCE energies of the furanosides
are lower than those of the pyranosides. For the hexoses with galacto
or fuco configurations, the situation is the same, whereas for the
sulfated glucoside, these energies are almost equal, and for both
mannosides, a strong preference for the pyranoside form is observed
(as expected).

Conclusions
The described results
demonstrate that for per-O-sulfated monosaccharides with galacto-,
gluco-, fuco-, arabino-, and xylo-configurations, the furanoside forms
are more stable than the corresponding pyranoside. The opposite situation
occurs for unsulfated derivatives, which is consistent with the common
knowledge that they predominantly exist as pyranosides in solution.1,2 We suggest that this inversion of the energetic parameters serves
as the driving force for the PIF rearrangement accompanied by the
unexpected ring contraction process. For both α- and β-mannosides,
the pyranoside forms are more stable even when all ring oxygen atoms
are sulfated. The latter result suggests that mannosides do not undergo
PIF rearrangement not only because of kinetics but also due to thermodynamic
reasons.

Experimental Section
General Methods
1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker AV-600, Bruker AV-400,
or Bruker Fourier 300HD spectrometers equipped with 5 mm pulsed-field
gradient probes at 298–303 K. The resonance assignments in
the 1H and 13C NMR spectra were made using COSY
and HSQC 2D experiments. Chemical shifts are reported in ppm and are
referenced to the DMF residual peaks in D2O (δ 3.01
for 1H and δ 37.54 for 13C).

Geometry
optimization was performed using the ORCA 2.9.1 program.19,20 RHF approximation with a 6-311++G** basis set was employed.21 Sulfates in the studied structures were treated
as anions. When the COSMO22 model was applied,
the built-in parameters for DMF were used. Geometry optimizations
were performed until the RMS gradient reached a value less than 10–4. The resulting energies were taken after applying
outlying charge correction. For the NCE calculations, ORCA 4.0 was
used, and NBO 6.0 was called directly from single-point calculations
of the previously optimized structures.

PIF Rearrangement (Typical
Procedure)7
To a stirred solution
of the monosaccharide substrate (0.05 mmol) in DMF (1 mL) was added
the Py·SO3 complex (5 equiv per OH). The reaction
mixture was kept for 10 min at 20 °C, and then, HSO3Cl (2 equiv per OH) was added dropwise under an inert atmosphere.
The reaction mixture was stirred for the desired period of time, neutralized
with aqueous NH4HCO3, concentrated in vacuo,
and coevaporated with H2O and then with D2O.
The residue was dissolved in D2O and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.
