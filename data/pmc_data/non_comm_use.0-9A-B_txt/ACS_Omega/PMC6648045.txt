Selective
synthesis of various versatile compounds from biomass
is of great importance to displace traditional fossil fuel resources.
Here, homogeneous metal nitrate (M(NO3)x)/(2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxyl (TEMPO) and M(NO3)x/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalyst
systems in glacial acetic acid and acetonitrile, respectively, have
been found to be highly active and practically sustainable for selective
oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) into 2,5-diformylfuran
(DFF) using pure O2 or even O2 in air as the
oxidant. The catalytic methods enable full HMF conversion with a nearly
100% DFF selectivity at 50 °C under atmospheric pressure using
a very simple reaction setup and workup. Mechanistic aspects are discussed.
The influences of reaction conditions such as different metal catalysts,
catalyst loading, solvents, and reaction temperature on the promotion
effect were studied. Meanwhile, the catalyst systems had also good
performance for aerobic oxidation of other alcohols.

Introduction
Biomass was considered by experts as the
only renewable source
of energy, and it had the potential to replace petroleum in manufacturing
chemicals and liquid transportation fuels.1−5 Conversion of bio-sourced saccharides to high value-added
chemicals has attracted much attention in recent years.6−8 As an important bio-based platform chemical, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
(HMF) can be converted to various high value-added products through
a variety of reactions including hydrogenation, oxidation, and hydration.9−13 2,5-Diformylfuran (DFF) is produced by selective oxidation of HMF14−17 that can be used, for example, as a starting material for the synthesis
of diverse poly-Schiff bases, polymer resin sealants, macrocyclic
ligands, pharmaceuticals, organic conductors, and the cross-linking
agent of poly(vinyl alcohol) for battery separations.18

Recently, chemists had paid much attention on the
synthesis of
DFF from HMF oxidation using molecular oxygen as the terminal oxidant
catalyzed by homogeneous or heterogeneous metal catalysts, such as
Ru,19−22 Au,23,24 Cu,25 Mn,26,27 Mo/V,28 and V.29−31 Most present
protocols require the use of noble metals,19−24 expensive ancillary ligands,25 high oxygen
pressure (up to 10 bar),30 and/or high
reaction temperatures (up to 140 °C)26−29,31 to ensure desirable DFF selectivities at high HMF conversions. There
is a need for cheaper, milder, and greener methodologies by designing
inexpensive catalytic systems for selective aerobic oxidation of HMF
to DFF. Accordingly, TEMPO and its analogues (N-oxyl
radical catalysts) have been investigated for reaction components.
However, because of the inertness of dioxygen, TEMPO alone is not
able to directly catalyze the oxidation of alcohols using dioxygen
as the terminal oxidant, so it is necessary to use a cocatalyst to
activate dioxygen and transfer its oxidizability to the next redox
cycle of TEMPO. The catalysts such as HNO3-immobilized
TEMPO and TEMPO-imidazolium salts can efficiently and selectively
catalyze the oxidation of alcohols to the corresponding aldehydes
or ketones.32,33 However, there are only a few
reported studies on applying N-oxyl radicals to catalyze
the oxidation of HMF.34,35 Yang et al.36 reported that benzoic acid/TEMPO obtained 86.7% conversion
of HMF and 77.8% yield of DFF at 0.4 MPa O2 in acetonitrile.
Although interesting achievement was obtained by this method in the
field of aerobic oxidation of HMF into DFF, it required relatively
high operating pressures (0.4 MPa), high catalyst loading (50 mol
%), special Teflon-lined autoclave reactors, high temperatures (up
to 100 °C), and long reaction time (24 h). Motivated by a desire
to develop better aerobic oxidation catalysts, especially stressing
the function of air oxygen in these transformations, we now describe
an efficient and selective oxidation of HMF to DFF by using two novel
cost-beneficial catalytic systems based on M(NO3)x/TEMPO and M(NO3)x/TEMPO/NaNO2 under mild, aerobic conditions (Scheme 1). The oxidations
were carried out in glacial acetic acid and acetonitrile solution
under the same conditions.

Scheme 1 Oxidation of HMF into DFF
Results and Discussion
Our study
commenced with screening the transformation of HMF to
DFF in the presence of different metal nitrates using molecular oxygen
as the oxidant. We initially tried this aerobic oxidation of HMF using
5 mol % Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and 5
mol % TEMPO as catalysts in glacial acetic acid as it is a good solvent
for the homogeneous system of the oxidation of alcohols to aldehydes,37,38 and this reaction could work smoothly at room temperature under
atmospheric pressure of molecular oxygen affording DFF in 93% yield
after 8 h (Table 1,
entry 1). Oxygen was simply flushed into a balloon and attached to
a flask containing a solution of HMF. To shorten the reaction time,
the reaction temperature was raised to 50 °C (Table 1, entry 2). Under lower Fe(NO3)3·9H2O loading at 2 mol %, 78%
yield of DFF was achieved (Table 1, entry 3). Only a trace amount of the product was
detected in a control experiment without the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O catalyst (Table 1, entry 4). To examine the role of iron in
the reaction, we selected two trivalent iron salts. In sharp contrast,
HMF was almost not oxidized when Fe(acac)3 and FeCl3·6H2O were used instead of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Table 1, entries 5 and 6), indicating NO3– played a critical role for the aerobic oxidation
of HMF. Subsequently, a series of inorganic nitrates were investigated
to test whether the metal cation also had a certain effect for the
reaction. We observed that all nitrates and nitric acid successfully
catalyzed the conversion, and Al(NO3)3·9H2O worked only as well as Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Table 1,
entry 9). The surprising result may be due to the identical amount
of NO3– in Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and Al(NO3)3. To test
the hypothesis, we increased the amount of the catalysts Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, HNO3, KNO3, and
NaNO3. It was easily found in Table 1 that conversions of the aerobic oxidation
were in proportion to the amount of NO3–. The efficiency of HNO3 or other metals (Cu, Zn) containing
nitrates as a viable alternative to Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was also quite surprising (Table 1, entries 8, 11, and 17). By
employing 15 mol % NO3– in combination
of TEMPO, 100% HMF conversion was obtained within 5 h with the highest
DFF yield of 99%, which was complete oxidations. As far as we are
aware, aluminum and zinc were applied here for the first time to mediate
efficiently the TEMPO-catalyzed aerobic selective oxidation of HMF
to DFF. The observation that Al(NO3)3·9H2O and Zn(NO3)3·6H2O,
which contain redox-inactive Al and Zn, are competent catalysts demonstrates
that a redox change at the metal is not necessary for HMF oxidation.39 Alkali-metal nitrates such as sodium nitrate
and potassium nitrate presented less catalytic activity (Table 1, entries 12–15).
The results indicated that the metal cation also has some influence
on the reaction, and the active species in the M(NO3)x/TEMPO catalytic system, maybe, is not the free
nitrosonium ion but the metal–TEMPO complex.39 The coordination of TEMPO to a Lewis acid makes TEMPO a
better oxidant. We suggested that the transformation proceeds via
a mechanism involving concerted proton-coupled electron transfer from
the C–H bond of HMF to the nitrogen atom of the metal–TEMPO
complex.40,41

Controlled experiments
with or without TEMPO confirmed their necessity
to obtain a desired outcome of the reaction. When Fe(NO3)3·9H2O was used without TEMPO, only little
HMF was oxidized (Table 2, entry 1), indicating that TEMPO participated in the aerobic oxidation.
Subsequently, increasing the amount of TEMPO to 2 mol % resulted in
a significant increase in terms of the product yield (Table 2, entry 2). Five mole percent
TEMPO was enough for complete transformation of HMF to DFF. Air has
the obvious advantage of safety and low cost. We next examined the
ability of the Fe(NO3)3·9H2O
catalyst to catalyze the HMF oxidation using air instead of pure oxygen
as the terminal oxidant. To our delight, DFF was still obtained in
a high yield of 81% after 5 h, and the selectively of DFF was even
higher (Table 2, entry
4). The lower DFF yield with air balloon was due to a lower concentration
of oxygen. The catalytic efficiency of other stable N-oxyl radical such as N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI)
replaced TEMPO with 5 mol % Fe(NO3)3·9H2O in AcOH under an oxygen atmosphere at 50 °C, however,
exhibited a very small amount of HMF conversion (Table 2, entry 5). Importantly, if
other common oxidants such as 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone
(DDQ), t-BuOOH (TBHP), and H2O2 were used instead of TEMPO and oxygen, HPLC analysis of the products
after 24 h of reaction revealed the further oxidation into 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid (FDCA) (14% yield at 18% HMF conversion, 45% yield at 46% HMF
conversion, and 30% yield at 30% HMF conversion).

It is known that
the solvent is a key factor affecting the reaction
efficiency. Thus, the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF was carried
out in a variety of common solvents such as ethyl acetate (EtOAc)
and 1,2-dichloroethane (DCE), which have been used in related alcohol
oxidation methods. As shown in Table 3, the solvent showed a remarkable effect on DFF selectivity.
Low DFF selectivity was obtained when the reaction was carried out
in EtOAc and DCE (Table 3, entries 1 and 2). The concentration of HMF can also have some effects
on the conversion of HMF during the oxidation process. When the concentration
of HMF was 1 mol/L, after reaction for 5 h, the yield of product DFF
was 61% (Table 3, entry
3); nevertheless, when HMF was set at a lower concentration of 0.5
mol/L under the same conditions, full conversion was achieved (Table 3, entry 4), indicating
that lowering the HMF concentration, the yields of product DFF can
be increased. However, a further reduction in the concentration of
HMF to 0.2 mol/L resulted in a lower yield of DFF.

To make the workup
procedure more simple and apply to substrates
containing acid-sensitive functional groups, the catalytic system
of Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO was further studied in CH3CN; however, the reaction was much slower (96% of conversion
after 24 h) than that in AcOH. Thus, we started to test the effect
of additives: The addition of NaNO2 helps much increase
in reaction rates (Table 4, entry 2). The result demonstrated that NaNO2 is
an activating agent for the iron–TEMPO catalytic system. The
cheap and readily available inorganic halide sodium chloride was screened
for such a purpose. In our hands, the addition of NaCl (5 mol %) as
an additive, as reported by Ma et al.,42 suggests that the reaction was completed within 15 h (Table 4, entry 3). Isobutyl nitrite (C4H9NO2) worked much slower (Table 4, entry 4). In addition, no
reaction occurred in the absence of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Table 4, entry 5) or TEMPO under oxygen (Table 4, entry 6), suggesting
that both Fe(NO3)3·9H2O and
TEMPO are required for the reaction. Then, Fe(acac)3 and
FeCl3 were used as catalysts in the catalytic system, and
Fe(acac)3 was almost inert for the selective oxidation
of HMF (Table 4, entry
7). As for FeCl3, much better conversion (36%) with 100%
selectivity was obtained (Table 4, entry 8). For Cu(NO3)2·3H2O, we found that HMF conversion significantly increased from
62 to 100% with increasing catalyst loading (Table 4, entries 9 and 10). Further experiments
with Al(NO3)3·9H2O presented
a poorer catalytic activity as compared with the case of AcOH as a
solvent (Table 4, entry
11). Increasing the amount of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O led to slight conversion of HMF (Table 4, entries 12 and 13). KNO3 and
NaNO3 were not effective at all for the oxidation of HMF
(Table 4, entries 14 and 15). These results clearly showed that employing
redox-active metals such as Fe and Cu had a better effect on the reaction
outcome in CH3CN. On the basis of the results of this experiment
and the previous reports,43 a plausible
reaction pathway is illustrated in Scheme 2. In this proposed mechanism, by the oxidation
action of FeIII or CuII, TEMPO is transformed
into a nitrogen carbonyl cation by a single-electron oxidation, and
this cation extracts a hydrogen atom from HMF to transform it to DFF.
Furthermore, TEMPO is restored to its original state, whereas the
FeIII or CuII ion is reduced to the FeII or CuI ion. At the same time, the NO3– ion oxidizes the FeII or CuI ion to the FeIII or CuII ion, whereas the
NO3– ion is reduced to the NO2– ion. In the meantime, molecular oxygen again
oxidizes the NO2– ion, and the NO3– ion is thus restored.

Switching from pure
oxygen to air and using the same atmospheric
pressure also gave the oxidized product DFF in 88% yield after 10
h (Table 5, entry 1).
NHPI provided a low conversion under our reaction conditions compared
with the reported literature (Table 5, entry 2).44 These results
demonstrated that the catalytic activity of NHPI was not so effective
to selectively oxidize HMF to DFF under the present reaction conditions.
Both HMF conversion and the selectivity of DFF were low using H2O2 as an oxidant (Table 5, entry 4). Moderate HMF conversion and the
DFF yield were obtained using t-BuOOH as an oxidant
(Table 5, entry 5),
which was different from the reaction in AcOH.

To further investigate
the catalytic performance of Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO/NaNO2, aerobic oxidations with different
temperatures were carried out in acetonitrile. As shown in Table 6, it was observed
that temperature played an important role in the oxidation of HMF
in acetonitrile. As expected, HMF conversion and the DFF yield increased
with the increase of reaction temperature from room temperature to
50 °C (Table 6, entries 1–4), but a rise over 50 °C resulted in a sharp
decline in HMF conversion (Table 6, entries 5 and 6). It could be concluded that the
higher temperature (above 50 °C) could result in a negative effect,
and 50 °C was the preferred temperature for the Fe(NO3)3/NaNO2/TEMPO catalytic system. Importantly,
the selectivity to DFF remained at a relatively constant and high
level (>94%) while the reaction temperatures were varied. The decline
in the yield of DFF over 50 °C may possibly be attributed to
the mass transfer resistance of oxygen from oxygen gas on the liquid
surface down to the liquid solution. Larger mass transfer resistance
of oxygen makes the concentration of oxygen lower, and as a consequence,
fewer HMF molecules will be successfully transformed into DFF.

The solvent effect
of the aerobic oxidation reaction at 50 °C
was examined to select an industrial friendly solvent. The results
of the oxidation of HMF in the presence of 5 mol % Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 5 mol % TEMPO, and 5 mol % NaNO2 under the atmospheric pressure of oxygen in different solvents
are summarized in Table 7. We were delighted to find that when using ethyl acetate as the
solvent, HMF could be converted into DFF within 10 h in an almost
quantitative yield of 98%. Therefore, ethyl acetate is also a desired
solvent. Under the same conditions, the conversion of HMF to DFF was
achieved in a high yield in 1,2-dichloroethane. However, such an environmentally
unfriendly chlorinated solvent is disfavored for large-scale industrial
application. The effect of the substrate concentration on the conversion
of HMF and the yield/selectivity of DFF is shown in Table 7. As the substrate concentration
increased from 0.2 mol/L to 0.5 mol/L, almost no change was observed
in the DFF yield (Table 7, entries 5 and 6). As the concentration of HMF was further increased
to 1 mol/L, the conversion of HMF decreased to 80%, which is most
likely due to the evaporation of CH3CN and the mass transfer
of the entire system being restricted by the increase in the substrate
concentration.

The two catalyst
systems were applied to the aerobic oxidation
of a variety of alcohols. As shown in Table 8, all benzylic alcohols were quantitatively
converted into the corresponding aldehydes with >99% selectivity
with
both of the catalyst systems. Secondary alcohols including cyclohexanol
and diphenylmethanol can be completely converted into corresponding
ketones with >99% selectivity with the Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalytic system in CH3CN, whereas
the secondary aliphatic alcohol cyclohexanol was failed to afford
the desired product with the Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO
catalytic system in AcOH. 1,2-Diols seldom interfered with the catalytic
aerobic oxidation were selectivity oxidized into ketone and aldehyde.
1,2-Diol was cleanly oxidized to α-dicarbonyl without cleavage
of the 1,2-diol bond with the Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO/NaNO2 catalytic system in CH3CN. Fe(NO3)3/TEMPO was catalyzed aerobic cleavage of 1-phenyl-1,2-ethanediol
into benzoic acid in the quantitative yield in AcOH. The stoichiometric
oxidants that are still predominantly used for such oxidative cleavage,
such as H5IO6, Pb(OAc)4, and KMnO4,45 generate stoichiometric hazardous
waste. Herein, we describe an applicable oxidative cleavage of 1,2-diols
that consumes atmospheric oxygen as the oxidant, thus serving as a
potentially greener alternative to the classical transformations.

Conclusions
We have developed two novel catalytic systems, including TEMPO
and metal nitrates, for the aerobic oxidation of HMF to DFF at 50
°C in the presence of 1 atm O2. Various aliphatic
and aromatic alcohols could be oxidized quantitatively to the corresponding
carbonyl compounds in the catalytic systems, and pure products are
generally isolable by simple extraction with an organic solvent and
water. We anticipated that this protocol will be of broad interest
and use to the chemical industries.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals used in this study were of
analytical reagent grade, commercially available, and used without
further purification unless otherwise noted. Reactions were carried
out in 5 or 10 mL glass flasks. HMF and balloons (500 mL) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich and used as an air reservoir. Reactions were monitored
using thin-layer chromatography on TLC silica gel 60 F254 aluminum
sheets (20 × 20 cm).

Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols into
Aldehydes or Ketones
with the M(NO3)x/TEMPO Catalytic
System
For a typical procedure, a 5 mL glass flask equipped
with a magnetic stirring bar was charged with HMF (126 mg, 1 mmol)
and glacial acetic acid (2 mL). Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (20.2 mg, 0.05 mmol) and TEMPO (7.8 mg, 0.05 mmol) were
consecutively added to the solution, and a balloon filled with oxygen
(500 mL) was then attached to the flask. The reaction mixture was
magnetically stirred at 50 °C, and the consumption of the starting
material was monitored using TLC. After completion of the reaction,
the reaction was quenched by adding EtOAc. The catalyst was removed
by washing with water. Aqueous phases were combined and then extracted
with EtOAc. The aqueous phase extracts were combined and dried with
MgSO4. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to yield pure
products.

Selective Aerobic Oxidation of Alcohols into Aldehydes or Ketones
with the M(NO3)x/TEMPO/NaNO2 Catalytic System
For a typical procedure, HMF (126
mg, 1 mmol), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (20.2
mg, 0.05 mmol), TEMPO (7.8 mg, 0.05 mmol), NaNO2 (3.4 mg,
0.05 mmol), and CH3CN (5 mL) were added to a 10 mL glass
flask. The resulting mixture was stirred under the atmosphere of oxygen
from a balloon at 50 °C until HMF disappeared (as monitored by
TLC). Upon completion, the reaction was quenched by adding EtOAc.
The catalyst was removed by washing with water. The aqueous phases
were combined and extracted with EtOAc. The aqueous phase extracts
were then combined and dried with MgSO4. The solvent was
evaporated in vacuo to yield pure products.

Product Analysis
HMF and DFF were analyzed by HPLC
using a reversed-phase C18 column (250 × 4.6 mm) at 25 °C
with a detection wavelength of 280 nm. The mobile phase was acetonitrile
and 0.1 wt % acetic acid aqueous solution (65:35 v/v) at 0.5 mL/min.
The HMF conversion and DFF yield were expressed as mol % in terms
of the total HMF amount. The amounts of HMF and DFF in the samples
were calculated by interpolation from calibration curves. Calibration
curves for the observed products were constructed by injecting known
concentrations of reference commercial products. Other alcohols were
analyzed using GC (Agilent, GC-7890A) equipped with a flame ionization
detector and an Rtx-5 (30 m × 0.32 mm × 0.25 μm) capillary
column and further confirmed by GC–MS. GC–MS spectra
were performed using an Agilent Technologies 7890A GC system with
an Agilent 5975 inert mass selective detector (EI) and an HP-5 MS
column (0.25 mm × 30 m, film: 0.25 μm).
