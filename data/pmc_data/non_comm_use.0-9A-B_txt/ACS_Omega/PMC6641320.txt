Sulfur
copolymers with high sulfur content find a broad range of
applications from Li–S batteries to catalytic processes, self-healing
materials, and the synthesis of nanoparticles. Synthesis of sulfur-containing
polymers via the inverse vulcanization technique gained a lot of attention
due to the feasibility of the reaction to produce copolymers with
high sulfur content (up to 90 wt %). However, the interplay between
the cross-linker and the structure of the copolymers has not yet been
fully explored. In the present work, the effect of the amount of 1,3-diisopropenyl
benzene (DIB) cross-linker on the structural stability of the copolymer
was thoroughly investigated. Combining X-ray diffraction and differential
scanning calorimetry, we demonstrated the partial depolymerization
of sulfur in the copolymer containing low amount of cross-linker (<30
wt % DIB). On the other hand, by applying NMR and electron paramagnetic
resonance techniques, we have shown that increasing the cross-linker
content above 50 wt % leads to the formation of radicals, which may
severely degrade the structural stability of the copolymer. Thus,
an optimum amount of cross-linker is essential to obtain a stable
copolymer. Moreover, we were able to detect the release of H2S gas during the cross-linking reaction as predicted based on the
abstraction of hydrogen by the sulfur radicals and therefore we emphasize
the need to take appropriate precautions while implementing the inverse
vulcanization reaction.

1 Introduction
Abundant
natural availability and over 70 million ton excess annual
production of elemental sulfur by petroleum refineries creates the
opportunity to develop new chemistry and applications to utilize sulfur.1−3 Processing and reaction of sulfur is difficult because of its limited
solubility in organic solvents and incompatibility with the majority
of chemicals and reagents; thus, the synthesis of a high-sulfur-content
material is a challenging effort. Elemental sulfur occurs in its most
stable eight-membered ring form (S8), which melts around
119 °C and forms sulfur rings of 8–35 sulfur atoms. Further
temperature increase to 159 °C leads to the formation of a high-molecular-weight
polysulfane via ring-opening polymerization. The polysulfane formed
is unstable at room temperature and reverts back to its stable S8 form due to the presence of sulfur radicals at the polymer
chain end.4

To overcome the depolymerization
issue, Pyun and co-workers developed
a new synthetic method called inverse vulcanization technique.5 In this method, the polymeric sulfur radicals
are stabilized by reacting with an aromatic divinyl molecule to produce
a highly cross-linked network that prevents depolymerization. They
also demonstrated that this method could be scaled up to the kilogram
scale.6 Initially, 1,3-diisopropenyl benzene
(DIB) was utilized as the co-monomer because of its high boiling point
(ca. 230 °C) and highly reactive divinyl group, which can form
a cross-linked structure with sulfur at high temperature. Later, many
researchers followed similar chemistry to prepare sulfur-rich copolymers
using various vinyl, allyl, and alkylnyl monomers.7−13 The versatility of this synthetic approach further extends it to
many naturally occurring monomers to produce polymers with a high
sulphur content.14−17 The high sulfur content in these materials gives them unique properties
that can be used in many applications such as Li–S batteries,10,18−20 as photoelectron catalysts for water splitting,21 as IR transparent high-refractive-index optical
materials,22−24 in mercury detection and mercury removal from wastewater,15,16,25,26 self-healing materials,13,27 and synthesis of nanoparticles.2,28

In recent literature,29−31 reports of copolymer synthesis
via inverse vulcanization method focus primarily on the preparation
of materials with high sulfur content (from 50 to 90 wt %) and direct
use for applications. However, the structural stability and the effect
of cross-linker on the copolymer are not yet fully explored.

In this work, we employed advanced NMR and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) spectroscopic techniques to elucidate the role of
DIB on the copolymer structure. The S-DIB copolymers with variable
DIB content ranging from 10 to 70 wt % were synthesized via the inverse
vulcanization technique. The solid-state NMR spectral editing and
relaxation techniques and solution NMR were applied to clarify the
changes induced in the copolymer structure by varying the DIB content.
With the aid of EPR and electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR)
spectroscopy, we assessed the formation of radicals with increasing
weight percentage of DIB. Additionally, we were able to detect the
release of H2S gas during the reaction of DIB with sulfur,
both in the NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra, and
by using a particular experimental setup that was specifically designed
to enable the identification of H2S gas release.

2 Results and Discussion
The reaction of sulfur with
DIB at 180 °C results in the formation
of highly cross-linked sulfur copolymers. The chemical and physical
properties of the sulfur copolymers depend mainly on the amount of
cross-linker; hence, sulfur copolymers with the DIB ratio varying
from 10 to 70 wt % were prepared. The schematic diagram for the copolymer
preparation is presented in Scheme S1 (Supporting
Information). All samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction
(XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and FTIR spectroscopy.
Details of sample characterization are provided in the Supporting Information.

2.1 Solid-State
CP MAS NMR Studies and Characterization
of Sulfur Copolymers
2.1.1 Cross-Polarization/Total
Sideband Suppression
Technique (CP/TOSS)
The structure of the prepared sulfur
copolymers was characterized by 1H and 13C solid-state
NMR techniques.

The 1H NMR spectra of the investigated
samples consist of two broad peaks, corresponding to aromatic and
aliphatic groups (see Figure S1 in the
Supporting Information) and do not reveal much information on the
structure of the copolymers. Therefore, we applied 1H–13C CP MAS NMR, employing in particular the total sideband
suppression technique (CP/TOSS) to suppress the sidebands.

The 1H–13C CP/TOSS MAS NMR spectra
of S-DIB copolymers for three distinct DIB concentrations are depicted
in Figure 1a. The two
peaks at δ = 130–150 ppm are assigned to the aromatic
carbons and the peak at δ = 58.6 ppm corresponds to the tertiary
C–S bond. The broad multiple peaks between δ = 20–50
ppm are assigned to the merging of peaks originating from methylene
(CH2), C–S, and CH3 groups. To further
analyze those multiple peaks, we conducted cross-polarization–polarization
inversion (CPPI) experiments.

the experimental contact time in the cross-polarization experiment

2.1.2 Cross-Polarization–Polarization Inversion
(CPPI)
The technique of cross-polarization–polarization
inversion (CPPI) is similar to heteronuclear single quantum correlation
(HSQC)–distorsionless enhancement by polarization transfer
(DEPT) method commonly applied for MAS spectral editing. In this method,
it is possible to distinguish between 13CH and 13CH2 as well as 13CH3 and nonprotonated
carbon signals depending on the polarization inversion time (PIT).
The CPPI experiment at low MAS speed of 5 kHz, with a polarization
inversion time (PIT) of 38 μs, results in zero signal for 13CH (peak b), inverted signal for 13CH2, whereas the quaternary 13C (peak c) and CH3 (peak e) peaks are unaffected.

The pulse sequence was initially
applied to the known polypropylene (PP) polymer containing CH, CH2, and CH3 carbon as a model sample (see Figure S2, Supporting Information). The experiment
was carried at low MAS speed of 5 kHz with PI = 38 μs. For comparison,
another experiment without polarization (PIT = 1 μs) was also
carried. CPPI spectra of PP without polarization inversion (PIT =
1 μs) showed all three major peaks at δ = 27.1, 31.5,
and 49.3 ppm, respectively, corresponding to 13C peaks
of 13CH3, 13CH, and 13CH2 groups, respectively. However, by implementing polarization inversion
with PI = 38 μs, the 13CH peak disappeared completely;
the 13CH2 peak was inverted, whereas the 13CH3 peak was unaffected. Thus, a CPPI pulse sequence
with similar parameters was applied to S-DIB samples to distinguish
between carbon nuclei belonging to different groups.

Spectra
of S-DIB-50-50 copolymer obtained by using CP combined
with polarization inversion (CPPI) are displayed in Figure 1b. The CPPI spectra of S-DIB
copolymer acquired without polarization inversion (PIT = 1 μs)
are similar to the corresponding CP MAS spectra comprising 13C peaks from all C sites along with aromatic sidebands (Figure 1b,A). However, by
applying inversion of the polarization with a PI time equal to 38
μs (Figure 1b,B),
the peak at 131.6 ppm (peak b) disappeared completely, confirming
that it belongs to the aromatic CH group. The other peaks at 150 ppm
(peak a), 58.8 ppm (peak c), and 27 ppm (peak e) are unaffected, indicating
that they belong to the aromatic 13C, quaternary 13C, and methyl 13CH3 groups, respectively. Interestingly,
the intensity of the peak at 33.2 ppm (peak d) is reduced significantly,
suggesting that the peaks of methyl carbon from different carbon environments
overlap. When the CPPI was applied without polarization inversion
(PIT = 1 μs) and with the contact time (CT) reduced to 50 μs
(Figure 1b,C), the
aromatic CH carbon peak appeared again at 131.6 ppm as expected, whereas
the quaternary aromatic and quaternary aliphatic carbon peaks at 150
and 58.8 ppm, respectively, were nullified. Methyl CH3 peaks
also disappeared completely because the 1H–13C dipolar coupling is diminished due to faster free rotation
of the CH3 groups. However, the intensity of the peak at
∼33.2 ppm (peak d) is reduced to more than half of its original
intensity. The reduction in the intensity of peak (d) either under
polarization inversion (Figure 1b,B), or by reducing the contact time without polarization
inversion (Figure 1b,C) could originate from the overlapping of CH peaks. It is also
worth noting that the broad peak observed between 33 and 52 ppm for
low contact time without polarization inversion (Figure 1b,C) disappears completely
under polarization inversion (Figure 1b,B). This could be due to the presence of the CH2 peak. These results provide further evidence that the CH2 groups react with sulfur radicals and partially convert to
CH under cross-linking reactions.

2.1.3 Cross-Polarization
Kinetics
In 1H–13C CP NMR experiments,
the relative intensities
of various carbon peaks depend on the relative effectiveness of the
dipolar coupling between each individual carbon spin and the surrounding
protons. Because the strength of the 13C–1H dipolar coupling is determined by the local environment of the
carbon nucleus, nuclei in different groups will be characterized by
different rates for maximal magnetization transfer (relative cross-polarization
rate: CH3 (static) > CH2 > CH ≥
CH3 (rotating) > C (quaternary)). It is thus possible
in the
cross-polarization experiments to distinguish between different types
of carbon nuclei by varying the contact time (CT) between the C and
H spins and monitoring the corresponding change in the relative signal
intensities.

Decreasing CT decreases the intensities of nonprotonated 13C due to the absence of polarization transfer from proton.
At short CT, the peak from methyl 13C disappears completely
due to the weak coupling, whereas the rigid 13CH and 13CH2 intensities are less affected. Figure 1c shows the 1H–13C CP/TOSS spectra of the S-DIB-50-50 copolymer for different
values of the CT ranging from 1500 to 50 μs. The observed signals
reveal a wide distribution of carbon kinetics in the S-DIB system.
For long contact times (CT = 1500 μs), protonated and nonprotonated
carbon peaks are clearly observed. However, with decreasing CT time,
the intensities of nonprotonated and 13CH3 peaks
decreased.

The spectrum obtained for 50 μs contact time,
i.e., for the
rapidly cross-polarizing, least-mobile components, showed mainly signals
from the copolymer. The aromatic 13CH peak appears at 130
ppm—without any change—whereas the aromatic 13C and the tertiary 13C peaks disappear completely. It
is also worth noting that the presence of a peak at 33.2 ppm can be
assigned to the CH group. This also further supports the presence
of CH in the copolymer.

The dependence of the intensities of
the peaks a–d with
the contact time CT for the S-DIB-50-50 copolymer is shown in Figure 1d. This change in
the peak intensities as a function of CT depicts the rate of build-up
of the carbon cross-polarized magnetization. The experimental results
in Figure 1d were analyzed
using the following expression31 1  where  which, in a cross-polarization
transfer experiment
between two spin systems I and S, describes the time evolution of
the magnetization mS of the S spins (13C in our case) as a function of the contact time CT with
the I spins (1H in our case). The above equation is valid
in the limiting case of , where N is the number
of spins. This condition is fulfilled for 13C at the natural
isotopic abundance in organic solids, where NI/NS ≅ 150.

This time
evolution is characterized by two different relaxation
times. The TIS term, which is a cross-polarization
transfer time constant, characterizes the rate of the energy transfer
between the I and S systems, whereas the T1ρ term is the rotating frame spin lattice relaxation time of the I
spins. The rate of spin lattice relaxation in the rotating frame is
most sensitive to motions occurring at the precession frequency ω1 = γH1 of the magnetization
about the spin-locking field H1 in the
rotating frame. Fast magnetization decay rates with low T1ρ values correspond to motions with a correlation
time τc ≈ 2π/ω1, whereas
slow magnetization decay rates with long T1ρ values indicate motions that are very fast or very slow on the time
scale of the rotating frame Larmor frequency ω1.

In this context, eq 1 has been fitted to the experimental data of Figure 1d, and the results are shown as lines in
this figure.

The fit of eq 1 to
the peak d (CH) experimental data gives TIS = 0.6 ms and T1ρ = 10 ms, whereas
the other groups—peak a: quaternary C, peak b: aromatic CH,
and peak e: methyl CH3—give similar TIS of about 1 ms and T1ρ > 10 ms. For these groups, therefore, the T1ρ term has negligible contribution to the fitting curves
of Figure 1d. This
is the reason why there is no decay of the fitting curves above 2000
μs. The results of the fits are shown in Table 1.

copolymer are plotted against the decay time τ for the 13C T1 spin-lattice relaxation.

of the carbon peaks (aromatic 13C, aromatic 13CH, aliphatic quaternary 13C, aliphatic 13CH,
and methyl 13C) in S-DIB-50-50 copolymer.

The experimental data were analyzed using the familiar
exponential
decay function, and the results are shown in Table 1 along with the chemical shifts assignment
of the observed peaks according to the attained experimental spectra.
Also shown are the TIS, T1ρ (H), and T1 values
for each peak obtained from the dynamic CP and 13C T1 experiments.

It is observed that aromatic
carbons and tertiary carbon showed
longest T1 relaxation. The peak at 33.2
ppm (peak d) showed the shortest T1 relaxation.
From the CPPI spectra, it has already been proven that the broad peak
at 33.2 ppm results from the merging of the peaks originating from
CH2 to CH3 groups and the CH attached to the
sulfur.

Therefore, there could be multiple contributions to
the faster
relaxation of the peak at 33.2 ppm: during the reaction, the sulfur
radicals attach on the vinyl groups, resulting in the formation of
a new C–S bond; moreover, the detachment of additional hydrogen
by sulfur radicals could result in unstable SCSH, which could equally
well contribute to the observed faster relaxation.

It is also
observed that the peak d at 33.2 ppm has all its dynamic
parameters reduced in comparison with the corresponding ones of the
other groups. This is an interesting finding obtained from two different
dynamic experiments (CP kinetics and T1 spin-lattice relaxation) signaling the significance of this specific
NMR peak in the analysis of the experimental results in relation to
the corresponding EPR observations.

2.2 Structural
Analysis of Sulfur Copolymers via
Solution NMR Spectroscopy
The prepared sulfur copolymers
were also characterized by solution NMR. 1H and 13C NMR spectra, taken by dissolving the samples in CDCl3, are shown in Figure 3b,c, respectively. As can be clearly observed in Figure 3b, the alkene =CH2 proton peaks at δ = 5.13 and 5.40 ppm are completely
absent from the spectra of the samples with a DIB content lower than
50 wt %. This indicates that in these samples, DIB has completely
reacted with sulfur. However, the spectra of the samples with a DIB
content higher than >50 wt % show two low intensity peaks corresponding
to alkene protons, suggesting the presence of unreacted DIB monomer
in the final product. It seems thus reasonable to conclude that the
DIB percentages >50 wt % lead to an incomplete cross-linking reaction
between DIB and sulfur. Moreover, all samples show a new peak around
δ = 1.61 ppm, which can be assigned to thiol groups. Most probably,
the highly reactive sulfur radicals abstract hydrogen from the methyl
carbon during the cross-linking reaction, generating thiol moieties.
The enlarged area from 1 to 2.5 ppm of the aliphatic region of the 1H NMR spectra for three different DIB mass percentages (30,
50, and 70%) is presented in the Supporting Information (see Figure S3). The abstraction of hydrogens results
in the appearance of multiple complex peaks between δ = 3.5–1.00
ppm. It is well known that the thiol group is a functional group containing
an active hydrogen atom; therefore, the chemical shift of the 1H NMR spectrum can be quite large, extending from 0.9 to 2.5
ppm, but with a most probable value around 1.5 ppm.32,33

of S-DIB copolymers with different weight ratio of components. (c) 13C, DEPT-135, and DEPT-90 spectra of S-DIB-50-50 and (d) HSQC–DEPT
overlapped with 1H NMR spectra for S-DIB-50-50.

The copolymers were further characterized with
phase-edited HSQC
and DEPT 90, and 135 experiments. The spectra of the 50–50
sample were identical to previously reported5 and the rest of the samples showed similar spectral characteristics,
with the 30–70 sample showing unreacted DIB present. A more
detailed analysis of the 1H spectra based on the interpretations
of the chemical shifts indicates that the methyl groups are connected
to a saturated bond. Moreover, the signals around 8.5 ppm could be
due to close in space and nearly coplanar aromatic rings of the DIB
units.

In Figure 3c, the 13C NMR spectrum is compared with the DEPT-135
and DEPT-90
spectra. In 13C NMR spectrum, the disappearance of alkene
carbon peaks and the appearance of new C–S peaks between δ
= 20–60 ppm supports the cross-linking reaction between DIB
and sulfur. The disappearance of peaks in DEPT-135 between δ
= 133.2–149.0 ppm and peak at δ = 54.6 ppm indicates
the nonprotonated aromatic and aliphatic quaternary carbon, respectively.
Inversion of the peak at δ = 48.2 ppm in DEPT-135 suggests the
presence of the CH2 group. The two distinct peaks at δ
= 34.3 and 39.3 ppm in DEPT-90 confirms the presence of the CH peaks.
The peaks between δ = 20.1–29.3 are from methyl group
in DIB. The DEPT-135 spectrum of S-DIB-30-70 with 70 wt % DIB (see Figure S4) shows series of inverted peaks between
δ = 39.5–49.8 ppm for CH2 group. This suggests
the presence of different environment of the CH2 group
compared to the samples with lower amount of DIB. This could be due
to the self-cross-linking of excess amount of DIB in S-DIB-30-70.
This result also confirms the higher reactivity of sulfur toward the
vinyl group and the sulfur-DIB reaction is dominated over DIB–DIB
self-cross-linking reaction.

HSQC–DEPT NMR experiments
were also utilized to obtain further
evidence on the presence of thiol proton and for a complete structural
analysis of the S-DIB copolymers. The HSQC–DEPT-135 spectrum
overlapped with 1H NMR of S-DIB-50-50 copolymer is presented
in Figure 3d. The HSQC–DEPT
results are in good agreement with the 1H, 13C, and 13C DEPT NMR experiments. The negative peak (green)
in HSQC–DEPT at δ = 3.2 ppm with secondary carbon at
δ = 48 ppm in 13C NMR confirms the CH2 moieties. The peaks at δ = 2.91 and 3.19 ppm further support
the presence of methine protons. However, the peaks at δ =1.61
ppm observed in 1H NMR give no signal in HSQC–DEPT
confirming the generation of thiol group during the reaction. Further
support to the above results stems from FTIR spectroscopy. The FTIR
spectra of S-DIB-50-50 show a weak and rather broad band at 2594 cm–1 (see Figure S5), not present
in neat DIB, that can be attributed to the −SH groups. Once
−SH groups are formed, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) may
be produced by the disproportionation of R–S–SH (to
sulfane components (oxidation) and H2S (reduction)). Therefore,
it is important to know if there is any release of H2S
gas during the cross-linking reaction. Thus, an experiment was designed
to identify the release of H2S during the reaction.

2.3 Experimental Identification of H2S Gas Release
The reaction setup is shown in Figure 4. In this setup, the reaction
tube containing equal weight ratio of sulfur and DIB was kept in an
oil bath and connected with the glass connector and the other end
of the connector was dipped in a glass vial containing 5 mL of 1 M
solution of silver nitrate (AgNO3). Any gas released from
the reaction tube was bubbled through the silver nitrate solution.
The reaction tube was purged with nitrogen and sealed. The temperature
of the oil bath was slowly increased to 180 °C, where it was
maintained for 1 h to ensure complete reaction. Initially, the reaction
mixture melts to form a yellow solution, whereas the color of the
silver nitrate solution remains transparent. As the reaction proceeds,
the reaction mixture turns dark brown and the silver nitrate solution
slowly turns dark gray and a dense black powder starts to settle at
the bottom of the vial (see the enlarged digital image in Figure 4c). The formed black
precipitate was filtered and analyzed with XRD, which confirmed the
formation of Ag2S (see Figure 4).

Figure 4 XRD comparison of AgNO3 and Ag2S, inset picture
(a, b) shows the digital image of experimental setup to detect the
release gas before and after the reaction, respectively. (c) Enlarged
image of AgNO3 solution showing change in color from clear
solution to black precipitate.

2.4 EPR Study
Room-temperature EPR signals
in solid state were observed for S-DIB copolymers containing more
than 50 wt % DIB, whereas samples with a low DIB content showed very
weak or negligible signals. Although the signal intensity correlates
strongly with the DIB content, it was found that there are other factors
that can contribute to it as well. For instance, the thermal treatment
of the previously prepared sample S-DIB-30-70 at 180 °C for 15
min resulted in enhancement of the EPR signal by a factor of 2. Figure 5B shows the relevant
EPR spectra together with the recordings of signals 2 and 5 days after
annealing.

Figure 5 (A) Continuous-wave (CW) X-band EPR spectra of S-DIB-30-70 (blue
trace) and S-DIB-50-50 (red trace) copolymers. (B) CW X-band EPR spectra
of S-DIB-30-70 copolymer before and after annealing at 180 °C
(equal amounts). (C) CW X-band EPR spectra of elemental sulfur before
and after thermal annealing at 180 °C.

After annealing, the spectrum becomes stronger and shows
a very
modest decay over time. Moreover, for elemental sulfur, no EPR signal
was detected either before or after thermal treatment (Figure 5C).

The typical intensity
of the observed signals corresponds to about
3 × 1013 spins/mg, and the spectrum consists of a
structureless derivative with g = 2.0044 ± 0.0005
and a linewidth of ΔBpp = 0.63 mT
(Figure 5A). A careful
analysis of the line shape shows that the spectrum can be fitted with
at least two Gaussian derivatives, which implies inhomogeneously broadened
lines. This is further supported by progressive saturation measurements
shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Progressive
microwave saturation for the sample S-DIB-30-70 at
room temperature. The solid line is the fit using the equation I(P) = (1 + P/P1/2)−b/2,
where I is the normalized EPR amplitude divided by
the square root of the incident microwave power P, P1/2 is the power at which the signal
attains half of its unsaturated value, and b is the
inhomogeneity parameter. Simulation parameters: P1/2 = 80.6 μW, b = 1.96.

The obtained saturation parameter b = 1.96 implies
a modest homogeneous broadening character for the CW EPR spectra of
copolymers (b = 1 indicates a completely inhomogeneously
broadened character, whereas b = 3 is for a homogeneously
broadened line).

Although the observed spectral parameters are
typical for radical
EPR signals, they do not provide unambiguous information about their
origin. Possible candidates include organic radicals related to DIB,
or sulfur-centered radicals in the polymer network.

To get further
insight into the hyperfine couplings, we employed
ENDOR spectroscopy. Figure 7 shows the Mims ENDOR spectrum of the sample S-DIB-30-70 measured
with the medium wave (mw) pulse sequence π/2-τ-π/2-T-π/2-τ-echo, where the frequency of an additional
rf pulse, placed between the second and third mw pulses, is swept.
Apart from the intense peak at the proton Larmor frequency, νH = 14.7 MHz (dashed line), originating from weakly coupled
matrix protons, the spectrum contains a doublet that corresponds to
the hyperfine coupling of about 3 MHz. This signal is assigned to
the proximal proton nuclei, which are close to the paramagnetic center,
i.e., methyl group hydrogens close to the tertiary carbon of DIB.

Figure 7 Mims ENDOR
spectrum of sample S-DIB-30-70. Experimental conditions:
temperature, 90 K; mw frequency, 9.722 GHz; magnetic field, 346.5
mT; τ = 96 ns; T = 10 μs; length of rf π-pulse,
9 μs; length of mw π/2-pulse, 16 ns.

On the other hand, the S-centered radicals (e.g., thiyl radicals,
RS·) are characterized by strongly anisotropic g values with a rhombic symmetry and cannot account for
the observed signals.34 To the best of
our knowledge, the only compatible S-related radicals with our observations
are sulfonyl radicals of the type RSO2,35 which, however, if present, would be masked by strong EPR
signal from the radicals on the tertiary carbon on DIB. According
to the NMR results (Figure 3b), the samples containing more than 50 wt % of DIB showed
the presence of unreacted double bonds, which through a self-cross-linking
reaction form DIB polymers, which are unstable and depolymerize via
radical mechanism at room temperature due to low ceiling temperature
of DIB.36 These results are also supported
by the absence of radicals in copolymers with a DIB content lower
than 50 wt %. Conclusively, the observed EPR signals arise mainly
from the radicals formed on the tertiary carbon of the DIB polymer.

2.5 XRD and DSC Study
Detailed characterization
and the spectra of XRD and DSC of pure elemental sulfur and S-DIB
copolymers with different weight ratio are presented in the Supporting
Information (see Figures S6 and S7). Both
XRD and DSC of sulfur gave evidence for the reformation of elemental
sulfur in the copolymer with the lower amount of cross-linker (i.e.,
DIB < 30 wt % with respect to the amount sulfur). It is well known
that the long chains of polysulfur are unstable at room temperature
and slowly revert to the more stable eight-membered sulfur ring. However,
the mechanism of unzipping is still unclear. When low amount of DIB
is used, the cross-linking density is lower and the copolymers formed
contain long chains of sulfur and, hence, the sulfur chains are not
completely terminated with the cross-linker. As a result, the long
chains of sulfur could partially undergo unzipping and results in
the formation of elemental sulfur in the copolymer. This is also evident
by the partial decrease in the color intensity of the freshly prepared
samples and aged samples (see Figure S7a,b). However, the samples containing higher amount of cross-linkers
(DIB > 30–50 wt %) results in the formation of shorter chains
of sulfur with a high cross-linking density and leads to a more stable
copolymer. The results are also supported by the XRD, where the complete
absence of crystalline sulfur peaks indicates the complete cross-linking
of sulfur and the formation of amorphous copolymer. Similar results
are also observed in DSC, where the sulfur-melting peaks are completely
absent in the copolymer with a higher amount of cross-linkers.

The overall effect of the cross-linker on the sulfur is demonstrated
in Scheme 1.

3 Conclusions
This work presents a detailed
analysis and characterization of
sulfur-DIB polymers prepared by the inverse vulcanization technique.
The presence of crystalline sulfur observed in the samples with a
low content of cross-linkers may be attributed to the reduced cross-linking
density, which leads to the formation of long sulfur chains. Similar
to polysulfur, these long sulfur chains are unstable at room temperature
and revert to stable monomeric sulfur. In the samples containing a
higher amount of DIB, the NMR spectra confirmed the presence of unreacted
alkene group, which leads to the formation of radicals, as evident
from the EPR and ENDOR spectra. The presence of radicals can significantly
degrade the stability of the copolymer. The above results are considered
to be of great importance for optimizing the sulfur–DIB ratio
to get a stable polymer. Moreover, this survey revealed the release
of H2S gas during the inverse vulcanization reaction, thereby
contributing to improving the protocol of the required precautions
in the application of this synthetic method.

4 Materials
and Methods
4.1 Materials
Elemental sulfur (S8, 99.9% pure, Sigma-Aldrich) and 1,3-diisopropenylbenzene
(DIB, 97%, TCI America) were used without further purification.

4.2 Synthesis of Sulfur-(1,3-diisopropenylbenzene)
(S-DIB) Copolymer
The sulfur-1,3-diisopropenylbenzene (S-DIB)
copolymers were prepared via the inverse vulcanization technique according
to a previously reported method.5 A representative
example of the synthetic procedure is given by the synthesis of S-DIB-50-50
as follows: sulfur (S8, 5 g) was added to a 50 mL glass
beaker equipped with a magnetic stir bar and heated to T = 180 °C in a thermostated oil bath until a clear orange molten
phase was formed. 1,3-Diisopropenylbenzene (DIB, 5 mL) was then slowly
added to the molten sulfur via syringe. The resulting mixture was
stirred at T = 180 °C until the liquid mixture
underwent vitrification and formed a solid mass. The vitrified mass
was further heated for around 30 min to ensure complete reaction.
The solidified mass was recovered by shattering the glass beaker and
carefully separating the product and glass fragments. A similar procedure
was followed for the synthesis of all S-DIB samples with the DIB mass
percentage varying from 10 to 70% by weight. The prepared samples
were denoted as S-DIB-x-y, where x and y indicate the percentage of sulfur
and DIB, respectively.

4.3 Sample Characterization
The synthesized
sulfur copolymers were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
spectra.

The diffraction (XRD) patterns were collected using
an analytical X’Pert PRO Powder Diffractometer (Cu Kα
radiation 1.5406 Å, 40 kV, 40 mA) in the range of 5–80°
2θ scale, with a step size of 0.02°. The DSC analysis was
carried out on a Discovery series (TA instruments) for temperatures
ranging from −30 to 200 °C at a ramp rate of 10 °C/min
under nitrogen atmosphere.

4.4 NMR Measurements
The solution NMR
experiments were carried out at 298 K on a Bruker Avance NMR spectrometer
operating at 500.13 MHz for 1H and 125.77 MHz for 13C and at 296 K on a Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer operating
at 250.13 MHz for 1H and 62.90 MHz for 13C.
The samples were prepared by dissolving DIB monomer and S-DIB copolymers
in CDCl3. DEPT and 2D-HSQC-edited experiments were performed
using the instrument’s library of pulse sequences.

The
solid-state NMR measurements were run on a Bruker AVANCE 400 (B0 = 9.4 T) spectrometer operating at 400.23
MHz for 1H and 100.65 MHz for 13C. The spectra
were recorded at room temperature using cylindrical 4 mm o.d. zirconia
(ZrO2) rotors. 1H NMR experiments were carried
out at the spinning speed of 12 kHz. 1H–13C cross-polarization/total sideband suppression (CP/TOSS) experiment
was performed at a spinning speed of 12 kHz to get a sideband-free
spectrum. A contact time of 2000 ms and a 1H 90° pulse
length of 5 μs were used. Typically, 1024 scans were acquired
with a relaxation delay of 5 s. A cross-polarization combined with
polarization inversion (CPPISPI) was used to provide spectral editing
of the 13C spectrum. Here, a short, polarization-inverting
spin-lock period of 38 μs is applied on the 13C and 1H channels following the initial contact time of 2000 μs
to achieve spectral editing. The CPPISPI experiment was carried out
at a low MAS speed of 5 kHz and the number of scans was fixed to 1024
with a relaxation delay of 5 s. This experiment nulls methine, inverts
methylene, and leaves methyl and quaternary carbon signals without
much change, thus leading to spectral discrimination.

4.5 EPR Measurements
Continuous-wave
(CW) EPR measurements at the X-band were performed on a Bruker ESP
380E spectrometer equipped with an EN 4118X-MD4 Bruker resonator.
The EPR experiments were performed at room temperature (293 K) and
at a microwave frequency of 9.646 GHz. The microwave power was 6.4
μW. The modulation amplitude used was 0.25 mT and the modulation
frequency was 100 kHz, whereas the number of accumulated scans was
fixed to 20. The measurements at cryogenic temperatures were performed
using a helium cryostat from Oxford Inc. The microwave frequency was
measured using a HP 5350B microwave frequency counter and the temperature
was stabilized using an Oxford ITC4 temperature controller. Pulse
EPR measurements at X-band (mw frequency 9.722 GHz) were performed
on a Bruker ESP 380E spectrometer equipped with an EN 4118X-MD4 Bruker
resonator. Mims-type electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) experiments
were carried out at 90 K with the pulse sequence of π/2-τ-π/2-T-π/2-τ-echo, with a π/2 pulse of length
16 ns, a radio frequency pulse of length 9 μs, and a waiting
time τ of 96 ns between the pulses.
