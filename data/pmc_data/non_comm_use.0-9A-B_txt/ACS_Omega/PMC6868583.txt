The effects of cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs) (12, 24, and 36% w/w)
on the microstructure and mechanical and thermal properties of canola
protein isolate films were evaluated. The incorporation of cellulose
nanocrystals led to homogeneous films, and new Fourier transform infrared
peaks appeared at 1055 cm–1, indicating the presence
and the interaction of CNCs with proteins and glycerol. The addition
of CNCs also improved the thermal stability of the films, since higher
temperatures were required for their thermal decomposition. In addition,
CNC addition resulted in an increase in tensile strength and a decrease
in elongation at break values due to strong interactions between the
OH groups in proteins, glycerol, and CNCs.

Introduction
Synthetic plastic materials have slow
degradation rates and are
produced from nonrenewable, petroleum-based resources. One alternative
to synthetic materials is bio-based polymers. These are derived from
renewable natural resources and degrade faster than petroleum-based
ones. Consequently, bio-based polymers can be incorporated into the
soil and act as carbon sources for plant growth.1,2 Another
advantage of bio-based polymers is their widespread availability,
since they can be derived from nonedible byproducts of domestic and
food industries.

Proteins are widely available bio-based polymers
with potential
applications in the food packaging industry.3 Many proteins can be used to form films.4 One of them is canola protein, which is obtained from the cake obtained
after pressing canola seeds (Brassica napus) L. for oil extraction and is considered a byproduct of the canola
oil industry. The proteins can be in the form of canola protein concentrate
and canola protein isolates (CPIs).5−7

Although canola
is the second most cultivated oilseed in the world,
there have been few studies examining its potential as an alternative
to synthetic plastic materials.5 Protein
films have several disadvantages compared to synthetic ones. They
have weak mechanical properties and poor barrier properties at high
relative humidity.4,8 One method to improve the film
properties involves the addition of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs).
CNCs are crystalline particles up to several micrometers in length
with diameters between 1 and 100 nm. These nanoparticles can be obtained
from cellulose, which is the most abundant plant material on earth.9,10 CNCs are stabilized by numerous hydrogen bridges, which allows them
to be highly ordered and crystalline, resulting in improved mechanical
properties of bio-based polymer films.11,12 In addition,
CNCs are able to improve the thermal stability of materials due to
their more thermally stable crystalline structure.13

The objective of this work was to evaluate the effects
of CNC addition
on the mechanical and thermal behavior of CPIs films. Prior to preparation
of the films, the stability of CNC suspensions and their relationship
with the obtained microstructures were also determined.

Results and Discussion
Zeta-Potential
(Pζ), Particle Size (Z-Average) and Particle
Size Distribution (PDI) of the Protein Suspensions
From Table 1, it
can be observed that protein suspensions were highly stable (Pζ
< 39 mV) and were able to remain dispersed in aqueous medium.14 Also, the addition of CNCs further improved
the stability of the suspensions, with samples containing higher CNC
concentrations having higher Pζ values. Since pH is the most
influential factor in the stability of aqueous dispersions, the results
could be explained in terms of the pH at which the suspensions were
prepared (9.5). This pH was far from the isoelectric point of the
proteins (pH 4.0–4.5) and allowed them to acquire electrical
charges to remain dispersed in the suspension.15 On the other hand, CNC particles are negatively charged
due to the presence of sulfate groups. This facilitates their dispersion
in aqueous media and improves the stability of protein suspensions.

Table 1 ζP, Z-Average,
and PDI Values of CPI Suspensions with CNC Addition
Film	ζP (mV)	Z-average (nm)	PDI	
CNC-0.0	–39.0	184.0	0.818	
CNC-12	–40.1	228.4	0.520	
CNC-24	–41.6	205.5	0.510	
CNC-36	–43.1	216.9	0.483	
Regarding the particle size, in the suspension of
the control film
(CNC-0.0), an average size of 184 nm was observed, while this value
exceeded 200 nm in the protein suspensions with CNCs. Likewise, the
addition of CNCs caused canola protein suspensions to move from a
polydisperse to near monodisperse behavior, which means that CNCs
created interactions with the functional groups of proteins and glycerol,
increasing and uniformizing the average size of its molecules and
making the sizes more uniform. According to Agrawal and Patel, 2011,14 the PDI of a suspension is related to the stability
of the suspension, with samples having PDI values closer to 0 being
more stable over time.

Microstructure of Protein Films
The colloidal stability
of CPI suspensions with CNCs resulted in films with a homogeneous
distribution of CNC particles (Figure 1). The control film without CNCs (Figure 1A-B) had a homogeneous surface
without cracks, similar to those reported for other protein films.16,17 Ogale et al., 2000,17 reported a smooth
and soft microstructure for cross-sectional views in soy protein isolate
films, while the valleys and ridges were related to a strong and ductile
material.

CPI films ± CNC. (A, B) CNC-0.0 film; (C–E) CNC-36 film.
(B) and (E) are cross-sectional views of CNC-0.0 and CNC-36 films,
respectively.

From Table 2, the
stability of protein suspensions led to the development of homogeneous
films with no agglomerated particles or structural defects such as
pores and cracks. This indicated good compatibility between the different
components in the film (CPI, glycerol, and CNC), which agrees with
other studies of bio-based polymer films reinforced with CNCs.12,18,19 Also, as the CNC content increased,
more irregular cross-sections (Figure 1E) were observed, which suggested that films with added
CNCs were stabilized by strong interactions between the various functional
groups in proteins, glycerol, and CNCs, and therefore, more compact
and tougher films were obtained.

Fourier Transform
Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy Analysis of the
CPI Films
Figure 2A shows the FTIR spectra of all of the films. Canola protein
films with added CNCs showed five main peaks. The vibrations of the
first peak at 3274 cm–1 were characteristics of
the N–H group in proteins. The second peak at 2920 cm–1 corresponded to the stretching of the C–H group. The third
(1648 cm–1), fourth (1537 cm–1), and fifth peaks (1233 cm–1) were related to
C=O (amide I), N–H (amide II), and C–N (amide
III) groups in proteins, respectively.20,21 In addition,
all films had a peak at about 1039 cm–1 that corresponded
to the vibrations of the C–O group in carbon number 3 of the
glycerol molecule.22 For this peak, the
films containing CNCs were wider and higher than that of the control
film (CNC-0.0). In fact, this peak contained overlapped peaks and
these were deconvoluted by a Lorentzian line function (Figure 2B) to observe their corresponding
FTIR vibrations.

Figure 2 (A) FTIR spectra of CPI films with CNC addition; (B) deconvoluted
FTIR spectra as indicated in (A).

Two peaks were observed in the deconvoluted FTIR spectra. The first
one at 1033 cm–1 corresponded to the glycerol molecule
present in all of the films. The second peak at 1055 cm–1 was due to vibrations of the C–O–C group in the glucopyranose
molecule present in the CNC.23,24 The displacement of
the glycerol peak toward lower wavenumbers in the films with CNCs
indicated some intermolecular interactions between OH groups in CNCs,
OH groups in glycerol, and the functional groups in the protein.25,26 In addition, films containing higher CNC concentrations had higher
peaks at 1055 cm–1, indicating greater degrees of
interactions between CNCs and the protein matrix.

Thermal Stability
of CPI Films
Figure 3 and Table 2 show the thermogravimetric curves (TGA) results of
the films with CNC addition. All of the films showed three stages
of weight loss (Figure 3A). The first took place between 50 and 125 °C, which corresponded
to the evaporation of water from the films. The second stage occurred
at 125–270 °C, and this was due to the evaporation of
glycerol. Finally, the third stage occurred between 270 and 500 °C,
which corresponded to the degradation of proteins and CNCs.27,28 For the control film (CNC-0.0), the second stage was longer and
began at a lower temperature than those in the films containing CNCs
(Figure 3A,B). This
indicated that interactions in the control film were weaker than those
in films containing CNCs and required a lower temperature to start
decomposition.

Figure 3 (A) Thermogravimetric curves (TGA) and (B) first derivative
curves
of CPI films with CNC addition.

Figure 3B shows
the first derivative of the mass loss curves and presents the thermal
stability of the films more clearly. The maximum decomposition temperatures
in the derivative curves are summarized in Table 3. Films containing higher CNC concentrations
had higher maximum decomposition temperatures (Tmax2 and Tmax3), indicating improved
thermal stability. Li et al., 2017,29 found
similar thermal behavior in soy protein isolate films plasticized
with glycerol and containing microcrystalline cellulose (MCL). They
attributed their results to the numerous hydrogen bonds between MCL
and the protein molecules.

Table 3 Formulations of Suspensions
for Casting
CPI Films
Formulation	Code	CPI (g)	Glycerol
(g)	CNC (g)	
1	CNC-0.0	3.5	1.75	0	
2	CNC-12	3.5	1.75	0.42	
3	CNC-24	3.5	1.75	0.84	
4	CNC-36	3.5	1.75	1.26	
The CNC-36 film had the highest maximum
decomposition temperatures
(Tmax2 and Tmax3) and residual content at the end of combustion. This was due to
the greater number of interactions between CNCs and protein molecules,
which improved its thermal stability. These greater number of interactions
are consistent with the homogeneous film structure in SEM micrographs
(Figure 1C-D) and higher
peaks in FTIR spectra (Figure 2B).

Tensile Properties of CPI Films
Figure 4 shows the
tensile property results for the
CPI films. The addition of CNCs led to an increase in tensile strength
(TS) and a decrease in elongation at break (EB) values of the films.
The tensile strengths of the 12, 24, and 36% (w/w) CNC films increased
significantly (p < 0.05) by 32, 199, and 296%,
respectively, over that of the control film. This could be explained
by the stable proteins in suspension (ζP < −39 mV),
which led to the development of films with a homogeneous distribution
of CNCs throughout the protein matrix. Also, the numerous molecular
interactions between CNCs and the protein molecules resulted in the
CNCs being able to support stress transfer from the protein matrix.
This led to an increase in tensile strength.12,30

Figure 4 Tensile
strength and elongation at break as a function of the CNC
content in the CPI films. Different letters indicate significant (p < 0.05) differences according to the Tukey test.

From Figure 4, an
increase in CNC concentration led to significant decreases (p < 0.05) in elongation at break values. These results
indicated that adhesion between CNCs and the protein matrix was relatively
weak. Consequently, this weak adhesion caused debonding to occur at
the interface between CNCs and the protein matrix, which resulted
in tensile failure at lower elongation values. Since CNCs are crystalline
particles and have a rigid structure, they could bridge the connections
between glycerol and protein to promote more ordered structures and
stronger interactions along the polymer matrix, which led to more
resistant but less flexible films. This behavior
is typical of bio-based polymer films reinforced with cellulosic nanomaterials.
The nanometric dimensions and abundant OH groups in the cellulosic
materials led to an increase in contact area and interfacial interactions
with other components, while reducing the mobility of polymer chains.13,31

Conclusions
The addition of CNCs improved the stability
(ζP < −39
mV) of CPI suspensions and reduced their polydispersity. This colloidal
stability was reflected in the SEM micrographs of the cast films that
showed a homogeneous morphology. FTIR results also indicated good
compatibility between CNCs, glycerol, and canola protein molecules.
The CPI films containing CNCs showed greater thermal stability than
the control film. Also, the addition of CNCs led to an increase in
tensile strength and a decrease in elongation at break values of the
films. This indicated that CNCs were able to support stress transfer
from the protein matrix during tensile testing. These results showed
that CPI films containing CNCs might have potential application as
a food packaging material.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
canola protein isolate (CPI; protein
content = 77.95 ± 0.02%) used for the film preparation was previously
prepared from a canola cake (Hyola 401 variety) obtained from the
Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales (INIFAP, Mexico).
An 8.1% w/w cellulose nanocrystal (CNC; particle length = 44–108
nm and particle diameter = 2.3–4.5 nm evaluated by atomic force
microscopy) suspension was used as a reinforcing material and was
kindly provided by CelluForce Inc. (Canada). Analytical grade glycerol
(J.T. Baker) was used as a plasticizer to avoid cracking in the films.

Preparation of Films
The films were prepared from two
suspensions. Suspension 1 was prepared by dissolving 3.5 g of CPI
in 40 mL of distilled water and adjusted to pH 9.5 with 2 N NaOH and
mechanically stirred for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C).
This suspension was then homogenized for 5 min at 10 000 rpm
in a Polytrom PT 3000 (Brinkmann). Suspension 2 involved dispersing
the CNCs (Table 3)
in 30 mL of distilled water. Glycerol was added to suspension 2 at
a constant concentration of 50/100 g of CPI, and the mixture was stirred
for 30 min at room temperature (25 °C). This suspension was homogenized
using the same conditions as those for suspension 1. The next step
was mixing both suspensions by mechanical stirring for 30 min at 25
°C and then homogenized as described above. The homogenized suspension
was later degassed to remove entrapped air, and 70 mL of the suspension
was placed in a square silicone mold (25 × 25 cm2),
where the films were casted at room temperature (25 °C) for 24
h.

Stability, Particle Size, and Size Distribution of CPI Suspensions
The stability and particle size distribution of the CNC suspensions
in canola protein were evaluated using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern
Instruments, Ltd., Westborough, MA). The samples were prepared by
diluting each suspension in ultrapure water at a solid concentration
of 0.5%. Dilutions were placed in a quartz cell, and their ζ-Potential
(Pζ) values, particle sizes (Z-average), and
particle size distributions (PDIs) were determined at 25 °C.

Characterization of CPI Films
Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The surface and
cross-sectional views of the films were observed in a Hitachi S-4700
scanning electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) using a voltage of 2
kV and a magnification of 1000×.

Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Spectroscopy
The
chemical composition of the films was determined using attenuated
total reflectance in a Nicolet iS10 FTIR spectrometer (Thermo Scientific,
Japan). The samples were scanned over an absorbance range of 885–4000
cm–1. Each infrared (IR) spectrum contained 24 scans
with a resolution of 4 cm–1.

Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
The thermal behavior
of the films was determined using a Pyris TGA 2950 (PerkinElmer, Waltham,
MA) according to ASTM E1131-08.

Prior to the test, the films
were conditioned for at least 48 h at a relative humidity of 43.2%
± 0.4, by using a supersaturated K2CO3 saline
solution. Each 7–9 mg film was heated from 40 to 600 °C
at a rate of 10 °C/min. Nitrogen gas was introduced into the
sample chamber at a rate of 20 mL/min. Two replicates were performed
for each sample.

Mechanical Analysis
The tensile
properties of the films
were determined using a TAXT2i texture analyzer (Stable, Micro Systems,
Survey, U.K.) in accordance with ASTM D882-10. The films were cut
into rectangles with 10 mm width and 100 mm length. The dimensions
were measured using a digital micrometer (Mitutoyo Cor., Kanagawa,
Japan) at five random positions. Before each test, the films were
conditioned at a relative humidity of 32% for 5 days at room temperature
(26 °C). The distance between clamps was 60 mm, while the strain
rate was 10 mm/s. A load cell of 25 kg was used in the tests. The
tensile strength (TS) and the elongation at break (EB) values were
determined from the obtained data. At least 15 replicates were performed
for each sample.

Statistical Analysis
Data were analyzed
using one-way
analysis of variance, and the statistical differences (p < 0.05) among treatments were obtained by the Tukey test using
Minitab version 17.1.0 statistical software (Minitab Inc., State College,
PA).
