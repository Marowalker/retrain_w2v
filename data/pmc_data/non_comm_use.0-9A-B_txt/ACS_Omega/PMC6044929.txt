A main
challenge in understanding the structure of a cell membrane
and its interactions with drugs is the ability to chemically study
the different molecular species on the nanoscale. We have achieved
this for a model system consisting of mixed monolayers (MLs) of the
biologically relevant phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine and the antibiotic surfactin. By employing
nano-infrared (IR) microscopy and spectroscopy in combination with
atomic force microscopy imaging, it was possible to identify and chemically
detect domain formation of the two constituents as well as to obtain
IR spectra of these species with a spatial resolution on the nanoscale.
A novel method to enhance the near-field imaging contrast of organic
MLs by plasmon interferometry is proposed and demonstrated. In this
technique, the organic layer is deposited on gold and ML graphene
substrates, the latter of which supports propagating surface plasmons.
Plasmon reflections arising from changes in the dielectric environment
provided by the organic layer lead to an additional contrast mechanism.
Using this approach, the interfacial region between surfactin and
the phospholipid has been mapped and a transition region is identified.

Introduction
Cell membranes constitute
a barrier around cells toward the surrounding
environment and may thus directly interact with drugs distributed
in organisms. To obtain a deeper understanding on the uptake of drugs,
their interactions with cell membranes are hence of utmost importance.
Important and major constituents in cell membranes are phospholipids,
which together with, for example, cholesterol and proteins determine
the properties of the membranes. These membranes do not consist of
a random distribution of phospholipids but rather microscopic domains
of disordered character as well as so-called lipid rafts, which possess
a high degree of order and commonly contain long-chain saturated phospholipids,
sphingolipids, and cholesterol.1−3 Drugs are likely to interact with
and bind differently to membrane domains of different characters.
Therefore, it is of interest to study how and where exactly drug interactions
within a cell membrane take place with a spatial resolution on the
nanoscale. Moreover, being able to chemically distinguish the nanodomains
of different lipids within a biological cell membrane would represent
an important step toward the understanding of the structure and functioning
of a cell.

Analytical microscopy instruments, such as conventional
infrared
(IR) microscopy and confocal Raman microscopy, are able to provide
spatially resolved chemical information. One major challenge of conducting
nanoscale studies of cell membranes is the fact that these approaches
have a spatial resolution that is diffraction-limited, yielding some
micrometers or a few hundreds of nanometers, depending on the probing
wavelength.4 In many investigations of
biochemical systems, this spatial resolution is not sufficiently detailed5 to address the crucial issues mentioned above.
Other types of analytical techniques, such as atomic force microscopy
(AFM) or electron microscopy, are capable of providing a spatial resolution
on the nanoscale but lack the corresponding chemical information.

However, with advanced techniques such as IR nanospectroscopy,
it is nowadays possible to obtain chemical information with a spatial
resolution of less than 20 nm.6 Of great
importance is that this technique is label-free; that is, the intrinsic
IR spectra of the cell membranes or the drug are directly employed
for their identification, which avoids using additional chemical or
biological labels,7 such as fluorophores.
For the present investigation on phospholipid monolayers (MLs), this
is a very important issue, as labels having a typical size corresponding
to a significant fraction of the phospholipid are avoided. IR nanospectroscopy
has recently been used to probe biomolecules, such as proteins,8−10 viruses,8,11,12 triglyceride
vesicles,13 biominerals,14 or thiol MLs attached to Au substrates,15 but until now, no studies of (model) phospholipid membranes
have been reported. Obtaining spatially resolved IR spectra from a
phospholipid layer over a nanoscale region is challenging because
the bilayer structure of the phospholipids in a cell membrane has
a thickness of only around 5 nm,16 and
accordingly only a few molecules will contribute to the recorded signal.
In addition, the membranes are relatively soft and easily destroyed,
especially when AFM is operated in the contact mode.

Biological
membranes are complex structures containing numerous
kinds of phospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol, and proteins.
In this study, we have applied IR nanospectroscopy and near-field
IR microscopy to identify phase separation in simple supported MLs
of the deuterated form of the phospholipid 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-phosphatidylcholine (hereafter denoted as “d-DSPC”) and the strongly surface-active agent surfactin,
shown in Figure 1.
DSPC was chosen because it is a phospholipid abundant in numerous
cell membranes, and its deuterated form was used to avoid spectral
overlap with the IR-bands originating from the surfactin. As an antibiotic
with the ability to penetrate cell membranes and to induce changes
in the membrane permeability, surfactin has an important effect on
biological systems.17,18 Because supported MLs can be
studied in air and are easier to prepare than supported bilayers,
which require an aqueous environment to remain stable, Langmuir–Blodgett
(LB) MLs of the individual species as well as mixtures of the two
compounds were prepared. Mixed surfactin/DSPC MLs have been previously
studied by AFM, and the results indicated that a phase separation
into domains occurred.19 However, because
AFM cannot provide chemical information, the composition of these
domains is still unknown. In this work, we combine near-field IR microscopy,
synchrotron-based IR nanospectroscopy,20−23 and topographical mapping by
AFM to investigate the chemical composition of these domains. In general,
being able to chemically distinguish nanodomains in (model) cell membranes
is an important step toward a deeper knowledge about domain formation
in biological cell membranes as well as how cell membranes interact
with pharmaceuticals at a molecular level.

Experimental Section
For the preparation
of the supported MLs of d-DSPC
and surfactin, a Langmuir trough (KSV 5000 LB, Biolin Scientific,
Sweden) was used. The two molecules were dissolved in chloroform (∼1
μmol/mL), and a few droplets of the solution were gently placed
on the water surface in the Langmuir Teflon trough. Two Delrin barriers
were compressed to a surface pressure of 25 mN/m (after evaporation
of the chloroform), which is close to the surface pressure experienced
by the phospholipids in cell membranes.24 The substrates initially located under the water surface were then
lifted at a speed of 1 mm/min, which resulted in the formation
of a LB ML on the substrate. In the d-DSPC/surfactin
mixtures, 75 mol % d-DSPC and 25 mol % surfactin
were mixed and spread on the water surface. Adsorbing a lipid ML onto
a solid substrate could affect the packing behavior in comparison
to the state on the water surface. However, the molecular structure
and, for example, domain formation, as is of interest to this article,
are believed to be preserved when transferring the lipid ML from the
water surface.

The MLs were prepared on two different substrates.
The first one
was a commercial gold-coated glass coverslip (Pelco), leading to strong
signal enhancement in the IR nanospectroscopy measurements. The second
type of substrate was ML graphene on silicon carbide (SiC). Graphene
has been used in the past in combination with IR nanospectroscopy,
such as for enhancing the resolution in subsurface imaging25,26 or for measurements in an aqueous environment.11 The employed method for the epitaxial growth of graphene
on 6H–SiC(0001) is described in ref (27).

The IR nanospectroscopy measurements
and near-field imaging were
performed on a scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscope
(s-SNOM) (Neaspec GmbH, Germany) consisting of an AFM system and an
asymmetric Michelson interferometer for phase-resolved IR nanospectroscopy,
which is called, in the following, nano-Fourier-transform (FT) IR
spectroscopy. The setup is described in more detail in ref (28). The AFM system was operated
in the tapping mode, and the tip oscillated with an amplitude Δz just above the sample surface at a frequency Ω.
Typical values for the measurements discussed in this work are Δz = 80–100 nm. The Au-coated Si cantilevers (Nanosensors
PPP-NCSTAu, NanoAndMore GmbH) had a resonance frequency in the range
between Ω = 76 and 263 kHz and a typical tip diameter below
50 nm.

The AFM tip was illuminated by two different sources,
depending
on whether it was used for imaging or spectroscopy purposes. For near-field
imaging, IR radiation from a continuous-wave grating-tuned CO2 gas laser (PL5, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) was employed.
The power incident at the AFM system was set between 5 and 10 mW.
For nano-FTIR spectroscopy, broadband synchrotron radiation from the
Metrology Light Source (MLS) was used.20,29 The MLS produces
25 ps pulses at a repetition rate of 500 MHz and provides ultrabroadband
IR radiation with a time averaged power integrated over the spectral
range from 400 to 4000 cm–1 of about 2 mW. The MLS
was operated in a special user mode, described in ref (28), which enables the spectroscopy
of thin organic layers.

Measured quantities are both the amplitude s and
phase ϕ of the IR radiation scattered from the Au-coated AFM
probe via interferometric methods,6,30 referenced
to a known material. In this case, a plain gold surface served as
a reference. To extract the nanoscale-resolved electrical near-field
component from the scattered field, η = s exp(iϕ),
higher harmonic demodulation technique was applied,31 obtaining ηn = sn exp(iϕn). Here, the detector signal was demodulated at higher
harmonics n of the tip modulation frequency Ωn = nΩ.

IR reflection/absorption
spectroscopy (IRRAS) was performed using
a gold substrate to identify the adsorbed species. Before use, the
Au surface was cleaned in bichromosulfuric acid and copious amounts
of Milli-Q water (18.2 MΩ cm). This cleaning procedure assured
a completely hydrophilic gold surface. It is assumed that the island
formation of d-DSPC and surfactin is created at the
water surface in the LB trough, and hence, the shapes of the ML films
on other substrates were similar to the films prepared on the gold
substrate. However, some deviations may occur because of the different
hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity of the substrates, as discussed below.
The IRRAS measurements were carried out using a Bruker IFS66 spectrometer
purged with nitrogen gas and equipped with a mercury cadmium telluride
detector. The angle of incidence was 85°, the spectral resolution
was 2 cm–1, and the spectrum was averaged over 3000
scans. The IR spectra of the corresponding pure chemicals (d-DSPC and surfactin) in the powder form were acquired on
a Bruker Tensor 37 system, using the attenuated total reflection (ATR)
mode. The resolution was 4 cm–1, and the spectra
were averaged over 1024 scans. The relative peaks heights in the IRRAS
spectrum can be distorted because of the highly sloping background
of the raw spectrum. Note that the spectra shown in Figure 2 have been baseline-corrected.

spectrum [trace (a)] of the MLs on a Au substrate and absorption
spectra (ATR) of d-DSPC and surfactin powder [trace
(b,c), respectively].

d-DSPC (1,2-distearoyl-d70-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine-1,1,2,2-d4-N,N,N-trimethyl-d9) with a purity
of >99% was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids. Surfactin (>98%)
and
chloroform (99.8%, stabilized with amylene) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
The compounds were used as received. The molecular structures of surfactin
and d-DSPC are shown in Figure 1. The corresponding absorption spectra of
powdered d-DSPC and surfactin samples are shown in Figure 2.

Results and Discussion
To verify that d-DSPC and surfactin were adsorbed
at the substrates, grazing incidence IRRAS was used to determine the
spectrum of the d-DSPC/surfactin mixture adsorbed
at a gold surface. The spectrum represented by trace (a) in Figure 2 shows a number of
characteristic peaks originating from both, d-DSPC
and surfactin. For d-DSPC, the symmetric and antisymmetric
PO2 stretches are observed at 1085 and 1260 cm–1,32 respectively, whereas the former is
blended with the CD2 and CD3 bending vibrations.33 At 820 cm–1, the antisymmetric
O–P–O stretch of d-DSPC shows a pronounced
band, and in the region 2100–2300 cm–1, the
CD2 and CD3 stretching vibrations are observed.
For surfactin, the CH2 and CH3 deformation modes
are observed at 1385 and 1468 cm–1,34 the amide II band is observed at 1540 cm–1,35 the amide I band is observed at 1678
cm–1,35 and the C=O
stretch in both d-DSPC and surfactin is observed
at 1740 cm–1, respectively.35,36 For the peaks at 890 and 1880 cm–1 observed for
the d-DSPC/surfactin mixture, there seems no counterpart
in the corresponding powder spectra. The peaks may be spectral artifacts,
for example, due to the background, especially because there are no
vibrations expected as high as 1880 cm–1, and their
origin is currently unknown. However, all characteristic peaks originating
from both compounds are observed and confirm their presence on the
substrate.

The d-DSPC/surfactin mixture forms
domains of
sub-micrometer size, as shown in Figure 3. The topography image (a) shows the ML mixture
deposited on the graphene sample and its typical terrace structures,
which develop during the epitaxial growth of graphene on SiC.37 The area captured by the image contains both
uncovered (left part) and lipid/surfactin-covered regions (right part)
because it is centered at the position up to which the ML was deposited
by the LB technique. The ML-covered areas can be clearly seen in the
material-sensitive AFM-phase image depicted in Figure 3b. Here, the predominantly green regions
correspond to the lipid-and-surfactin-covered area, whereas the predominantly
blue region shows the uncovered graphene ML.

Figure 3 AFM images show (a) the
topography and (b) the corresponding phase
contrast of the deposited lipid domains on the epitaxially grown graphene
ML. The area captured contains both uncovered and lipid-covered regions
of the substrate. In the phase image, the predominantly green regions
correspond to lipid-covered area, whereas the predominantly blue region
shows the exposed graphene ML. The topography values along the two
line cuts following the black and red arrows in (a) and (b) correspond
to steps over different lipid domains and are shown in the inset of
(a). (c) AFM topography and (d) the corresponding phase contrast of
the lipid mixture deposited on Au substrate mapped with a higher magnification
to capture a single domain. The region mapped is completely covered
with the lipid mixture. The white horizontal line shown in (d) crosses
the domain boundary. A sequence of 40 nano-FTIR spectra has been recorded
along this line shown in Figure 4a.

Because the SiC terraces
are atomically flat, the topography image
allows the determination of the thickness of the lipid domains along
the black and red arrows shown in Figure 3a, which are located on a single terrace.
The black arrow runs from the plain substrate on top of the slightly
thinner domain, from which a layer thickness of (1.8 ± 0.4) nm
can be deduced. The red arrow runs from the thicker domain to the
thinner domain, resulting in a height difference of (1.9 ± 0.1)
nm. The total thickness of the thicker layer can thus be derived as
(3.7 ± 0.5) nm. The lower bound of this result of 3.2 nm still
slightly differs from the expected theoretical thickness of 2.5 nm.
Note, however, that the AFM tapping mode has been employed, which,
for changes in the material-related surface forces across a topographical
step, is known to produce an additional uncertainty.38,39

The topography of the lipid mixture deposited on the Au substrate
is shown in Figure 3c. The surface roughness of the Au substrate is of the same order
of the domain thickness. Nevertheless, the domain geometry can be
seen in the corresponding AFM-phase image in Figure 3d. Compared to the graphene substrate, the
Au surface provides a sufficient enhancement of the near-field signal
to allow the acquisition of nano-FTIR spectra from the ML.28 A line scan of locally resolved spectra will
be discussed below and has been performed along the white horizontal
line shown in Figure 3d, crossing a domain boundary. To determine the packing order of d-DSPC in this mixed system, vibrational sum frequency spectroscopy
(VSFS) was used. As explained in more detail in the Supporting Information, it was concluded that the d-DSPC hydrocarbon chains possess a fairly ordered structure,
although not in a perfect all-trans configuration. Thus, although
surfactin is a bulky molecule, the d-DSPC islands
are, on average, fairly ordered.

The results of the line scan
are shown in Figure 4. It displays the phase part of the nano-FTIR
spectrum varying
along the white line in Figure 3d. The position x = 0 μm corresponds
to the side labeled as “A” and the position x = 2 μm corresponds to the side labeled as “B”
in Figure 3d. The domain
boundary lies at the position x = 1 μm. The
phase part of the s-SNOM signal, ϕ2(ν̃),
has been chosen because the near-field phase has been identified previously
to correspond closely to the IR absorbance measured in the grazing
incidence configuration.40 The near-field
signal was obtained from locking onto the second harmonic of the oscillation
frequency of the tip, Ω, and referencing to the spectrum of
a plain Au surface.

Figure 4 Nano-FTIR spectra of the d-DSPC/surfactin
mixture
on a Au substrate are shown in (a) as a function of the position along
the white line marked in Figure 3d. The ends labeled “A” and “B”
in Figure 3d correspond
to positions 0 and 2 μm in (a), respectively. A transition region
with reduced peak heights may be identified as marked in the figure.
The spectra shown in (b) are matched to the wavenumber axis in (a).
The spectra are averaged over the positions from 0 to 1 μm (red)
and 1 to 2 μm (blue). For comparison, a nano-FTIR spectrum of
a pure d-DSPC ML on a Au substrate is shown in (c).
The gray areas indicate the prominent bands found in (b) and (c) and
correspond to the features of d-DSPC shown in Figure 2. The inset shows
an AFM mechanical phase plot with a white scale bar of 1 μm
length. The d-DSPC layer forms a closed layer up
to the position at which the ML was deposited by the LB technique.
A two-dimensional plot of the optical phase signal ϕ at two
different laser frequencies is shown in (d).

The line scan consists of 40 spectra recorded in steps of
50 nm
over the spectral range of 780–1100 cm–1.
Within this range, the combined tip enhancement and detector sensitivity
lead to sufficient signal for the analysis of the individual, that
is, nonaveraged spectra. Spectral features near 820 and 1030 cm–1 are visible at positions between x = 1 and 2 μm, which, according to Figure 3c,d, belong to the topographically higher
domain. A larger spectral range of 780–1350 cm–1 can be analyzed by averaging all spectra on either side of the domain
boundary. The result is shown as the red and the blue curves in Figure 4b, corresponding
to positions x = 0–1 and 1–2 μm,
respectively. All peaks marked by the gray bars are also found for d-DSPC in the ATR and IRRAS spectra (although these spectra
have different spectral resolutions and exhibit slight shifts40), as shown in Figure 2. The peaks near 1200 cm–1 may be artifacts as a result of the reduced intensity of the radiation
source in this spectral region.

As a result, the above observations
indicate that the topographically
higher domain is mainly composed of d-DSPC. This
conclusion is further supported by the near-field spectrum shown in Figure 4c. This spectrum
corresponds to a sample on which only the d-DSPC
layer has been deposited. Again, all features marked by the gray bars
coincide with the spectrum of Figure 4b indicated by blue color, belonging to the topographically
higher domain. In the topographically lower domain, no d-DSPC content could be detected, allowing only surfactin to be the
main constituent. Note that a stronger field enhancement at the AFM
tip would be required for nano-FTIR measurements on the above samples
for wavenumbers above 1300 cm–1, to achieve direct
chemical identification of surfactin MLs.

For IR imaging of
the spatial distribution of the d-DSPC ML, the tip
was illuminated by monochromatic radiation at one
of the resonant modes. Figure 4d shows the corresponding map of the phase signal, ϕ2, at a wavenumber of ν̃ = 1030 cm–1, which was within the tuning range of the CO2 laser and
also corresponds to one of the observed peaks in the nano-FTIR spectrum
shown in Figure 4b.
The contrast between the different domains in the upper image of Figure 4d is clearly visible.
Tuning the laser to ν̃ = 970 cm–1 where
no resonant mode was observed results in a vanishing contrast, as
shown in the lower part of Figure 4d.

In the above imaging investigations, the contrast
resulted from
small shifts in the optical phase produced by the approximately 3.7
nm thick d-DSPC film. This phase signal is reduced
even further for thinner layers, such that the sensitivity to detect
any d-DSPC content in the topographically lower domain
is expected not to be sufficient. To further enhance the contrast
for imaging thin films, it is proposed to use substrates which support
the propagation of surface plasmons excited by a near-field probe.
Here, epitaxial graphene on SiC is used as a substrate. Previously,
it has been demonstrated that IR radiation focused on a sharp metalized
tip as in the present s-SNOM setup may launch circular surface plasmons
in the graphene layer around the tip.41,42 The plasmon
generation and the subsequent propagation are both sensitive to the
wavenumber of the incident laser radiation ν̃L as well as to the dielectric environment of the graphene, described
by the dielectric function of the SiC substrate, ε1, and for the material on top of the graphene, ε2. The surface plasmons may be reflected whenever the dielectric environment
changes along the propagation path, leading to characteristic spatial
interference patterns, for which it is considered as plasmon interferometry.43,44

In the present case, changes in the dielectric environment
should
mainly be caused by variations in the layer thickness of the lipid,
its chemical composition, and its structure. Plasmon generation will
also be sensitive to processes influencing the Fermi energy of the
graphene, EF, such as the molecular orientation
due to its dipole character.45,46 The resolution limit
depends on the order of magnitude of the plasmon wavelength, λP, as described by the simplified plasmon dispersion relation:47 1  where ℏ is the reduced Planck
constant, c is the speed of light, and ε0 is the
vacuum permittivity. The interference pattern detected by the graphene
layer constitutes an additional contrast mechanism on top of the near-field
scattering on the tip-lipid system.

This method is illustrated
in Figure 5. The topography
of the lipid mixture containing
a particularly large domain is shown in Figure 5a. It should be mentioned that the order
and orientation of the molecules may differ from that on the gold
surface because gold is hydrophilic, whereas graphene is more hydrophobic.
However, clear domain formation is observed in both cases, which is
of most relevance in this study. To resolve a potential plasmon standing
wave pattern, the wavenumber of the laser radiation ν̃L should be sufficiently different from the longitudinal optical
phonon frequency of the SiC substrate48 to avoid damping, that is, ν̃ > 950 cm–1. In addition, to prevent damping due to lipid ML absorption, one
requires ν̃ < 1000 cm–1, such that
for the measurement in Figure 5b, the wavenumber was set to ν̃ = 978 cm–1. The maps in Figure 5 present the scattering amplitude s showing, on
average, a higher scattering probability (blue color code) over the
topographically higher domain, together with a fine structure discussed
below. In the dark regions, s is minimal as a result
of unwanted bilayer graphene domains.49 The topographical edges of the domain appearing as black lines are
superimposed over the scattering amplitude s.

Figure 5 d-DSPC/surfactin ML domains on an epitaxial graphene
substrate. The AFM topography is shown in (a). Optical signal amplitude
demodulated at the fourth harmonic, s4, at ν̃ = 978 cm–1 is plotted in (b).
The black lines represent the edges of the domains. The optical contrast
deviates from the topographical data, with two examples marked by
the two arrows shown in (a) and (b). The corresponding magnified areas
are shown in (c) and (d) for the red and black arrows, respectively.
(c) (red arrow) Example of contrast over a topographically flat region,
clearly showing the material boundary; (d) (black arrow) contrast
around topographical boundaries. A smaller domain [not shown in (a)]
is plotted in (e) and (f), imaged at ν̃ = 966 and 978
cm–1, respectively. The feature size is of the order
of the estimated plasmon wavelength λP, for which
the contrast becomes sensitive to small changes in ν̃
and hence λP in (e) and (f).

In some regions, the interference pattern deviates from the
edges
defined by the topography, indicating additional material-related
boundaries. Two examples are illustrated by the red and black arrows
in Figure 5a,b. The
corresponding magnified areas are shown in Figure 5c,d. In the first example, interference stripes
along a topographically flat region are visible in (c). In this case,
plasmon reflections may have occurred at a material boundary, such
as between a surfactin and a d-DSPC-rich domain.
The above measurements shown in Figure 4 indicate that the d-DSPC-rich domain
is about 2–3 nm higher, whereas in the case shown in Figure 5, they are of the
same height. This may be due to a collapse of the d-DSPC molecules in this border region and a resulting loss of ordering.
A signature of this border region may also be visible in the line
scan in Figure 4a.
A transition region may be identified within x =
1.0–1.3 μm in this line scan, as indicated in Figure 4a. In this region,
the peak height is significantly reduced, which may be due to a reduced
thickness.

The second example depicted in Figure 5d shows an interference pattern caused by
topographical boundaries. An abrupt change in the thickness will also
lead to a change in the dielectric environment. Hence, an interference
pattern due to topographical boundaries can also be expected in a
chemically homogeneous area.

An example of a particularly small
domain is shown in Figure 5e,f at laser wavenumbers
of ν̃ = 978 cm–1 (as above) and 966
cm–1, respectively. The Fermi energy of the graphene
before being covered by the lipid was EF ≈ 200 meV so that ν̃ = 978 cm–1 is still sufficiently low to avoid interband absorption in the graphene
layer at 2EF. From eq 1, one derives for uncovered graphene λP ≈ 370 nm for laser wavenumbers of ν̃ =
978 cm–1 and λP ≈ 600 nm
for ν̃ = 966 cm–1. Hence, in the latter
case, the plasmon wavelength, λP, is closer to the
order of the feature size and accordingly less of this structure can
be resolved. This effect is confirmed in Figure 5e,f. Whereas in Figure 5e, the upper left part of the domain still
contains details on some parts of the domain structure, in Figure 5f, these details
evidently disappear. Note that λP grows rapidly as
ν̃ approaches the SiC phonon resonance where ε1 approaches zero.

Conclusions
We have employed near-field
FTIR microscopy and spectroscopy in
combination with AFM imaging to study the domain structure of mixed
MLs of the biologically relevant phospholipid DSPC in the deuterated
form and the antibiotic surfactin. The obtained chemical information
enabled the investigation of the domain formation of the two components
with a spatial resolution of 50 nm. Furthermore, a novel method to
enhance the near-field imaging contrast by plasmon interferometry
using graphene-covered substrates was demonstrated. Scanning thin
organic layers on top of graphene at appropriate doping levels is
demonstrated to be a contrast-enhancing method for detecting material
and molecular orientation changes, influencing the dielectric environment
and doping properties of graphene, respectively. The concept was successfully
demonstrated by revealing a transition region of the domain boundaries
of the organic MLs. The combined spectroscopic and topographic information
of domains of biomolecules could thus be used to investigate the corresponding
interaction mechanisms. Such a knowledge is of great importance in
furthering our understanding about the complex structure of cell membranes
as well as in determining the interaction of drugs on cell membranes
at the nanolevel.
