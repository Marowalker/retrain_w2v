Amphiphilic block polypeptides of
poly(sarcosine)-b-(l- or d-Leu-Aib)6 (SL12OMe or SD12OMe)
and poly(sarcosine)-b-(l-Leu-Aib)7 (SL14OMe) were reported to self-assemble into a nanotube morphology.
Herein, we tried to construct a phase-separated nanotube by sticking
two different kinds of nanotubes. SD12OMe nanotubes were found to
stick to SL14OMe nanotubes with a heat treatment at 50 °C, but
the sticking yield was limited. The amphiphilic polypeptides were
functionalized by replacement of methyl ester with aromatic groups
of N-ethylcarbazole (SL12Ecz) and naphthalimide (SD12NpiTEG),
but they lost the ability to form homogeneous nanotubes. A fraction
of the functionalized amphiphilic polypeptides mixing in the nanotube-forming
amphiphilic polypeptides, a mixture of SL12OMe and SL12Ecz (9:1) as
well as a mixture of SD12OMe and SD12NpiTEG (9:1), allowed nanotube
formation. These two kinds of nanotubes partly stuck together with
a heat treatment at 15 °C to maintain a segregated state of two
kinds of aromatic groups along the nanotube, resulting in the formation
of a phase-separated nanotube.

Introduction
Phase separation of
the components in molecular assemblies is generally
observed in biological systems and is deeply related with the functional
aspects of the molecular assemblies. For example, rafts in biological
membranes are regions having a high density of cholesterol, sphingomyelin,
and some proteins, which are considered to contribute to the efficient
signal transduction through membranes.1 Membrane tubules are another example of phase separation as the
tubules growing from a giant vesicle were composed of a liquid disordered
phase, which is related with the phenomenon of lipid sorting.2 Apart from lipid membranes, however, it is still
challenging to obtain molecular assemblies in water, showing chimeric
morphologies constituted by a single membrane with phase separation.
So far, we have reported a chimeric morphology of a nanoround-bottom
flask shape where vesicle and tube morphologies coexisted as a result
of phase separation.3 The driving force
for the phase separation was stereocomplex formation between right-
and left-handed helical peptide blocks in membranes generating vesicle
morphology, whereas the excessively existing helical peptides were
excluded from the stereocomplex region and self-assembled into tube
morphology.

On the other hand, unsymmetric membranes displaying
chemically
different surfaces were successfully prepared by artificial systems.4−8 In these unsymmetric membranes, two surfaces are considered to be
phase-separated into two chemically different species along the membrane
normal. The other type of lateral phase separation in the membrane,
however, is extremely difficult to obtain with self-assembling artificial
amphiphiles because two separated phases are liable to proceed to
membrane fission. The nanoround-bottom flask shape molecular assembly3 is also regarded as a successful example for
lateral phase separation in the membrane, however, with the help of
taking different morphologies in accordance with the phase-separated
regions of two different amphiphile compositions. This consideration
prompted us newly to challenge a molecular assembly of a single morphology,
not a chimeric morphology, composed of laterally phase-separated membrane.
We herein design a phase-separated nanotube where two kinds of nanotubes
stick together but without mixing the component amphiphiles. This
type of preparation may be classified into an assembling strategy
of inducing directional attraction between components.9−11

The nanotube having a phase separation along the long tube
axis
can be functionalized by incorporating different chromophores into
the phase-separated regions. One example is a photovoltaic system
composed of hole- and electron-transporting layers. The similar configuration
can be realized by using the phase-separated nanotube where two regions
of the nanotube contain hole and electron mediators. As a starting
system aiming at a photovoltaic nanotube, N-ethylcarbazole
(Ecz)12 and naphthalimide13 were chosen for hole- and electron-transporting chromophores,
respectively, and were introduced to the terminal of the hydrophobic
helical block of amphiphilic polypeptides (Figure 1). The two kinds of chromophores also make
it possible to evaluate whether component amphiphilic polypeptides
are separated in the nanotube after sticking the two kinds of nanotubes
by measuring fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between
them. Preparative conditions to obtain the functionalized phase-separated
nanotube are studied here by transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
observations and fluorescence measurements in order to deepen our
knowledge on molecular assembling under an advanced geometrical control
which is prerequisite for functional molecular assemblies for the
next generation.

of
polymerization of the poly(sarcosine) block was determined by 1H NMR and MALDI-TOF-MS (see Figures S1–S12 in the Supporting Information).

Results and Discussion
Sticking Two Kinds of Nanotubes without Chromophores
Amphiphilic polypeptides synthesized here have a common sequence
of poly(sarcosine)-b-(l- or d-Leu-Aib)n (l and n = 6;
SL12OMe, d and n = 6; SD12OMe, l and n = 7; SL14OMe). N-terminals of poly(sarcosine)
blocks were attached with glycolic acid, and the number-averaged molecular
weights of poly(sarcosine) blocks were in the range from 21mer to
31mer. C-terminals of (Leu-Aib)n blocks
were modified with several groups of methyl ester (OMe), Ecz, 4-N,N-diethylamino-1,8-naphthalimide (Npi),
and PEGylated naphthalimide (NpiTEG) (Figure 1). SL12OMe was previously reported to form
nanotubes with a heat treatment at 90 °C for 10 min.14 The most-frequent nanotube length and diameter
were a few hundred nanometers and ca. 80 nm, respectively, which remained
as a major fraction even after heating at 90 °C for 24 h with
a minor fraction of newly formed nanotubes of a doubled length.14 SL12OMe nanotubes therefore have a difficulty
on tube elongation by further self-sticking. On the other hand, SL12OMe
nanotubes were found to easily stick together with SD12OMe nanotubes
at 50 °C to change the morphology into planar sheets.15 The driving force for the association of two
kinds of nanotubes is the stereocomplex formation between right- and
left-handed helical blocks of SL12OMe and SD12OMe. When a mixture
of SL14OMe and SD12OMe, which have different hydrophobic helical blocks
by two residues, was dispersed in water and heated at 90 °C for
24 h, nanotubes of a large diameter of 200 nm were generated.17 SL14OMe and SD12OMe were mixed well in the molecular
assemblies owing to stereocomplex formation, but the mixture self-assembled
into nanotube morphology. With the background of these previous results,
we tried to find out a possible condition for SL14OMe and SD12OMe
nanotubes to stick together. Both SL14OMe and SD12OMe nanotubes have
similar dimensions of ca. 80 nm diameter and 300–400 nm nanotube
length (Figure 2).
When two kinds of nanotubes were mixed together and heated at 50 °C
for 4 h, the nanotube morphology and diameter were retained but the
histogram of nanotube length showed a wide distribution with a distinct
fraction larger in the region of 700–1200 nm length than SL14
and SD12 nanotubes. Neither nanotube of SL14OMe nor SD12OMe showed
any elongation of the nanotube length with heating at 50 °C for
4 h (Figure S13). The nanotube fraction
of 700–1200 nm length is therefore considered as a result of
sticking SL14OMe and SD12OMe nanotubes, even though the elongated
fraction was limited. Further, when a mixture of SL14OMe and SD12OMe
in ethanol was injected into a tris-buffered saline (TBS) buffer and
heated at 50 °C for 4 h, a mixture of SL14OMe and SD12OMe generated
nanotubes of larger diameter than 80 nm in addition to nanosheets
by TEM observations (Figure S14). The nanotube
fraction of 700–1200 nm with 80 nm diameter should be therefore
composed of membrane without mixing SL14OMe and SD12OMe components.
Taken together, SL14OMe and SD12OMe nanotubes were able to stick together
to generate phase-separated nanotubes, probably because the lateral
diffusion of SL14OMe and SD12OMe into the other nanotube region after
sticking should be suppressed at this low temperature of 50 °C,
otherwise the diameter would become larger with mixing. However, the
sticking rate was limited because of the low temperature.

Molecular Assembling of
Amphiphilic Polypeptides Carrying Chromophores
SL14 and SD12
were modified at C-terminals with N-ethylcarbazole
(SL14Ecz) and 4-N,N-diethylamino-naphthalimide
(SD12Npi), respectively. However, amphiphilic
polypeptides of SL14Ecz and SD12Npi self-assembled into nanosheets
and irregular morphologies, but any nanotubes were not observed (Figure 3a,b). The failure
in nanotube formation should be due to the hydrophobic aromatic groups,
making the blocks too hydrophobic. We therefore redesigned amphiphilic
polypeptides SL14Ecz and SD12Npi to reduce the hydrophobic properties.
Accordingly, the hydrophobic block length of SL14Ecz was shorten from
14mer to 12mer (SL12Ecz). The naphthalimide group of SD12Npi was attached
with hydrophilic two chains of tri(ethylene glycol) (SD12NpiTEG).

(1:9) after heating at 90 °C for 1 h. Bars = 100 nm (a,b), =
200 nm (f), and = 500 nm (c–e,g–i).

SL12Ecz was found to self-assemble into nanosheets just after
injection
into a TBS buffer (Figure 3c), which were transformed into nanotubes and vesicles with
heating at 90 °C for 1 h (Figure 3d). Even though nanotubes were observed partly, vesicle
morphology is considered to be a thermodynamically stable assembly
for SL12Ecz. Previously, poly(sarcosine)-b-(d-Leu-Aib)7 was reported to self-assemble into curved and
planar nanosheets of a few ten nanometers size, which were transformed
transiently into nanotubes with ca. 80 nm diameter with heating at
90 °C for 1 h. Further heat treatment for 72 h in total caused
complete transformation into vesicles of ca. 200 nm diameter.18 Consequently, it is considered that the helical
blocks associate tightly owing to the good space filling of interdigitated
isobutyl side chains from the neighbor helices.19 As a result, the amphiphilic polypeptide self-assembled
into a curved sheet morphology, which easily changes the morphology
into a nanotube morphology with temperature. However, a vesicular
morphology is more thermodynamically stable than a nanotube morphology
by disappearance of the hydrophobic open edges of a nanotube. In the
case of SL12Ecz, vesicles therefore should be a prevailing morphology
after a long period of heating. In order to obtain thermodynamically
stable nanotubes, a mixture of SL12Ecz and SL12OMe was examined. A
mixture of SL12Ecz and SL12OMe at 1:1 ratio was found to generate
stable nanotubes with heating at 90 °C for 3 h (Figure 3e).

SD12NpiTEG also self-assembled
into nanosheets and vesicles when
heated at 90 °C for 1 h in a TBS buffer (Figure 3f). Similarly to the case of SL12Ecz, the
mixing effect of SD12OMe on morphology was studied. A mixture of SD12NpiTEG
and SD12OMe at a ratio of 1:1 self-assembled into nanotube-related
morphologies including three-way and closed-end nanotubes (Figure 3g). Further increase
of the SD12OMe content up to 1:2 ratio resulted in molecular assemblies
mostly of nanotubes with heating at 90 °C for 1 h (Figure 3h). A mixture of SD12NpiTEG
and SD12OMe at 1:9 molar ratio homogeneously generated nanotubes (Figure 3i).

Sticking Two
Kinds of Nanotubes Having Chromophores
The nanotubes prepared
from a mixture of SL12Ecz and SL12OMe at 1:1
molar ratio were mixed with the nanotubes prepared from a mixture
of SD12NpiTEG and SD12OMe at 1:9 molar ratio. When the nanotube mixture
was heated at 90 °C, fluorescence spectra showed immediate decrease
of emission intensity from Ecz around 370 nm with the increase of
emission intensity from NpiTEG around 520 nm (Figure 4a). The excitation spectra with monitoring
the NpiTEG emission showed increase of contribution of Ecz around
350 nm upon heating, which confirmed the excited energy transfer (FRET)
from Ecz to NpiTEG (Figure 4b). The same changes in the fluorescence and excitation spectra
of FRET were also observed even at a lower temperature of 30 °C
but required 24 h to reach those spectra at the equilibrium state
with heating at 90 °C for 10 min (Figure 4c,d). It is therefore concluded that two
kinds of nanotubes fused together to mix their components similarly
in the temperature range from 30 to 90 °C but with different
time scales.

Figure 4 Changes in fluorescence (a,c) and excitation (b,d) spectra
of a
mixture of SL12Ecz/SL12OMe (1/1) nanotubes and SD12NpiTEG/SD12OMe
(1/9) nanotubes with heating at (a,b) 90 °C and (c,d) 30 °C.

The morphology of the reorganized
molecular assemblies was analyzed
by TEM observations. The TEM image after heating at 90 °C for
1 h revealed vesicle formation without any remaining nanotubes (Figure 5a). This morphology
transformation is consistent with the previous result that a mixture
of SL12OMe and SD12OMe generated vesicles after heating at 90 °C
for 1 h. The mixing of 50% SL12Ecz and 10% SD12NpiTEG did not have
any influence on tendency of vesicle formation of a mixture of SL12OMe
and SD12OMe at 90 °C. It is striking however that the nanotube
mixture at 30 °C for 1 h generated a certain fraction of elongated
nanotubes (Figure 5b). Further heating at 30 °C for 3 h led to inhomogeneous morphologies
including a small amount of vesicles (Figure 5c). Because a mixture of SL12OMe and SD12OMe
nanotubes did not stick together and any vesicles were formed at 30
°C for 3 h (Figure S15), it is considered
that the presences of 50% SL12Ecz and 10% SD12NpiTEG in each molecular
assembly should promote the nanotube sticking and the lateral diffusion
of amphiphilic polypeptide components in the fused membranes after
sticking even as low as 30 °C. Probably the degree of molecular
packing of helical blocks should be loosened by the bulky aromatic
groups, which allows lateral diffusion of the components in membranes.
The open edges of nanotubes should also be more hydrophobic because
of the hydrophobic aromatic groups to promote the nanotube sticking.
Even though the nanotube sticking was promoted, the number of nanotubes
sticking into an elongated nanotube was limited to two or a few at
most. The limitation of nanotube elongation may be related with the
membrane stiffness. The amphiphilic polypeptides have large aromatic
groups which loosen the molecular packing in the membrane, resulting
in low elasticity. The fragile nanotubes probably cannot elongate
the length further.

(c) after heating at 30 °C for 3 h. Bars = 500 nm. (d) Histograms

(1/9) nanotubes after heating at 30 °C for 1 h (green).

In the aim of reduce the lateral
diffusion in membranes to obtain
the phase-separated nanotubes, the content of SL12Ecz was reduced
down to 10% and the incubation temperature was decreased to 15 °C.
The fluorescence and excitation spectra of a mixture of nanotubes
prepared from SL12Ecz/SL12OMe (1/9) and SD12NpiTEG/SD12OMe (1/9) showed
nearly no change for 3 days at 15 °C (Figure 6). However, TEM observations revealed that
only a mixture of the two kinds of nanotubes increased fractions of
nanotube lengths in the range from 400 to 550 nm with even longer
than 1 μm nanotube but individual nanotube did not (Figure 7). Two kinds of nanotubes
should therefore stick together without mixing the peptide components
in the sticking membrane. The two kinds of nanotubes were able to
stick together at 15 °C because of the strengthened hydrophobic
aromatic interaction between nanotube open edges, even though the
sticking rate to generate elongated nanotubes was low. On the other
hand, the diffusion of the components in membrane was suppressed because
of low temperature, resulting in the generation of the phase-separated
nanotube as revealed by no change in the FRET measurement.

Conclusions
Two kinds of nanotubes were examined on
sticking together in the
aim of preparation of a phase-separated nanotube. The driving force
for nanotube sticking is ascribable to stabilization energy of stereocomplex
formation between right- and left-handed helices. SL12OMe and SD12OMe
nanotubes stuck together to convert the morphology into sheets at
50 °C, meaning that the lateral diffusion of each component in
the elongated nanotube is allowed to induce change in morphology.
However, SL14OMe and SD12OMe nanotubes partially grew into a phase-separated
elongated nanotube, suggesting that the lateral diffusion of each
component became suppressed in the sticking nanotube membrane at 50
°C because of the difference in the helical block lengths; otherwise,
the mixing of the components would change the morphology into a thick
nanotube. There are two factors governing the sticking of the two
nanotubes, stereocomplex formation and temperature. The stereocomplex
formation leads the membrane into a homogeneous mixing state owing
to a favorable association between the two components of the right-
and left-handed helices. However, the mixing rate of the two components
in membrane, which is in other words lateral diffusion, depends on
temperature. With high temperature, the two components will be mixed
so quickly and the phase-separated nanotube is not attainable. On
the other hand, for sticking of the two nanotubes, the open edges
of the nanotubes must be exposed to the counterpart to join, which
requires a certain amount of activation energy supplied by raising
temperature. In the case of the combination of SL14OMe and SD12OMe
nanotubes, with a high temperature of 90 °C, they stuck together
allowing lateral diffusion to afford a thick nanotube. The compromised
condition of temperature was found to be 50 °C, at which the
two nanotubes stuck together but without further lateral diffusion
resulting in a thin nanotube.

Two kinds of nanotubes prepared
from SL12EcZ/SL12OMe (1/1) and
SD12NpiTEG/SD12OMe (1/9) fused together to change the morphology even
at 30 °C, meaning that small amounts of the modified components
with large aromatic groups should loosen the membrane structure to
allow the lateral diffusion of components in membranes. With decreasing
the content of SL12Ecz and lowering the incubation temperature down
to 15 °C, however, the lateral diffusion was significantly suppressed,
resulting in sticking two kinds of the nanotubes to generate a phase-separated
nanotube accompanying segregation of two kinds of aromatic groups
along the nanotube.

The strategy employed here for sticking
nanotubes uses stereocomplex
formation between the right- and left-handed helices, which leads
to a membrane of homogeneous mixing of the two components resulting
in disappearance of phase separation. We controlled temperature to
hinder the mixing of the two components here for maintaining the phase-separated
state in the sticking nanotube. We are planning newly to obtain the
phase-separated nanotube with using two amphiphilic polypeptides with
different hydrophilic blocks, which have a tendency to segregate each
other depending on the temperature.

Experimental Section
Syntheses
of Amphiphilic Polypeptides
Amphiphilic polypeptides
including SL14OMe17 (Figure 1) were synthesized by the conventional liquid
phase method similarly to the previous report.20 The synthesis of the PEGylated naphthalimide (NpiTEG, Figure 1) is described in
the Supporting Information. The degrees
of polymerization of poly(sarcosine) blocks were determined from 1H NMR and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) (see Figures S1–S12).

Preparation and Sticking of Peptide Nanotubes
Amphiphilic
polypeptides were dissolved in ethanol (50 mg/mL). The peptide solution
(20 μL) was injected into 10 mM TBS (pH 7.4, 1 mL), stirred
at 4 °C for 30 min, and heated at 90 °C for a predetermined
period to self-assemble into a nanotube morphology. In order to stick
the obtained nanotubes, they were mixed and stored at 50, 30, or 15
°C.

Morphology Observation by TEM
TEM images were analyzed
by JEOL JEM-2000EXII at an accelerating voltage of 100 kV. The peptide
solutions were applied on a carbon-coated Cu grid. The samples were
negatively stained by 2% uranyl acetate, followed by suction of the
excess solution with a filter paper.

FRET Measurement
Excitation and emission spectra were
recorded by a JASCO FP-6600 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The optical
path length was 1 cm, and the peptide concentration was 0.25 mg/mL.
The emission spectra were measured with excitation at 330 nm. The
excitation spectra were obtained by monitoring the emission from NpiTEG
at 550 nm.
