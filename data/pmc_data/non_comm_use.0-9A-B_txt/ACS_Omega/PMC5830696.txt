The
range of applications of diverse graphene-based devices could
be limited by insufficient surface reactivity, unsatisfied shaping,
or null energy gap of graphene. Engineering the graphene structure
by laser techniques can adjust the transport properties and the surface
area of graphene, providing devices of different nature with a higher
capacitance. Additionally, the created periodic potential and appearance
of the active external/inner/edge surface centers determine the multifunctionality
of the graphene surface and corresponding devices. Here, we report
on the first implementation of nonlinear laser lithography (NLL) for
multilayer graphene (MLG) structuring, which offers a low-cost, single-step,
and high-speed nanofabrication process. The NLL relies on the employment
of a high repetition rate femtosecond Yb fiber laser that provides
generation of highly reproducible, robust, uniform, and periodic nanostructures
over a large surface area (1 cm2/15 s). NLL allows one
to obtain clearly predesigned patterned graphene structures without
fabrication tolerances, which are caused by contacting mask contamination,
polymer residuals, and direct laser exposure of the graphene layers.
We represent regularly patterned MLG (p-MLG) obtained by the chemical
vapor deposition method on an NLL-structured Ni foil. We also demonstrate
tuning of chemical (wettability) and electro-optical (transmittance
and sheet resistance) properties of p-MLG by laser power adjustments.
In conclusion, we show the great promise of fabricated devices, namely,
supercapacitors, and Li-ion batteries by using NLL-assisted graphene
patterning. Our approach demonstrates a new avenue to pattern graphene
for multifunctional device engineering in optics, photonics, and bioelectronics.

Introduction
The patterning and
microstructuring of graphene films can selectively
enhance certain (opto)electronic capabilities of graphene-based devices
and can offer not only new applications but also most importantly
multifunctionality of the next generation graphene-based devices for
energy storage, photonics, and bioelectronics.1−4 Engineering graphene structure
restricts the motion of electrons in specific directions, for example,
by forming a junction-like structure that changes from a zero-gap
conductor to a semiconductor. Hence, when graphene is patterned into
narrow ribbons5 or ordered in accordance
with the substrate geometry,6 we expect
the opening of an energy gap and, consequently, tuning of the transport
properties of graphene-based devices. Besides, patterning increases
the specific surface area of graphene, which resulted in a higher
capacity of corresponding devices. The multifunctionality of the graphene
surface driven by imposing a super periodic potential7 and forming active centers (by defects, oxygen-based functional
groups, and self-assembled monolayers) controls graphene electronic
properties consistently. Therefore, patterning of graphene could be
a good approach for tuning the transport properties of graphene-based
devices and the reactivity by increasing the surface area and artificial
ordering of graphene.

Several methods which require execution
of different steps for
the patterning procedure have been demonstrated. For example, mechanical
cleavage,8 scanning probe lithography,9 photocatalytic etching,10 plasma etching,11 chemical etching,11,12 assembling,13 combination of soft-lithography
with oxygen plasma etching,14,15 and so forth. Although
these methods are suitable for large-scale fabrication of a variety
of patterns, they involve multiple processes and, therefore, are time
consuming and costly. Alternatively, so-called in situ techniques
enable the growth of already-patterned structure based on, for example,
patterning of catalytic metal films before growth,16 laser-induced chemical vapor deposition (CVD)17 and so forth. However, most of the grown materials
require to be transferred on a desired substrate that will lead to
the generation of surface and edge defects. To prevent disordered
carbon–carbon bonds from film defects and to avoid the formation
of contaminations (e.g., graphene release with catalyst), direct writing18,19 or cutting of already grown graphene20,21 has been employed.
Among all manufacturing techniques, only nonlinear laser lithography
(NLL)22—a new laser-based technique—is
a single-step, high-speed (1 cm2/15 s), highly productive
(does not require specified environmental conditions) and, hence,
the most efficient method to fabricate small-/large-scale and mask-free
micro-/nanopatterns of various nature and symmetries. Since 1965,
the fabrication of regular nanostructures23 on various surfaces (metals,24 semiconductors,25 and glasses26) was
realized by laser-induced periodic surface structuring—LIPSS.27 The main challenge is still precise quality
control.26 We propose the NLL (improved
LIPSS) as a novel solution, which offers highly accurate control of
the formation of nanostructures induced by ultrashort pulses. NLL
initiates and regulates the metal-oxide nanostructures with unprecedented
uniformity because of the positive nonlocal and negative local feedback
mechanisms, respectively.22 Most importantly,
a significant advantage of the method is an ability to use nonplanar/3D
and rough substrate surfaces that are in demand in device engineering.
In this study, we report a new approach for multilayer-graphene patterning
with the NLL technique for developing high-resolution graphene-based
microstructured devices on various substrates.

We experimentally
demonstrate the feasibility of predetermined
patterning of multilayer graphene (p-MLG) on a nickel substrate by
using a high-power femtosecond (FS) Yb fiber laser. Regularly patterned
MLG is CVD grown on the surface of preliminarily structured nickel
foil, followed by transfer onto the desired substrate for characterization
and device testing. The fabricated p-MLG films show high-quality morphology
in comparison to the other existing fabrication methods, which is
demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), water contact
angle (WCA) measurement, surface free energy and adhesion calculation,
Raman spectroscopy, and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. We
manifest electro-optical measurements on p-MLG as well as show the
performance of graphene-based devices in supercapacitor and battery
constructions. This research provides a new approach for the first
patterning of MLG with the NLL technique for developing graphene-based
devices.

Results and Discussion
Line nanostructure formation
on MLG is performed through its growth
on a prepatterned nickel foil with precisely determined nanostructures
on its surface. A schematic of the nanostructuring setup and the principle
of the laser beam scanning over the substrate are illustrated in Figure 1a,b, respectively.
Detailed characterization of the NLL technique is described in the Method Summary part.

a FS laser system (Yb-doped fiber laser,
1030 nm), galvanometer scanner (GS), motorized 3D translation stage
(3D-S), half-wave plate (HWP), and polarization beam splitter (PBS).
(b) Scanning direction of the laser beam over the sample. The laser
beam spot is represented as a pink circle. The polarization direction
is indicated by an E vector. (c) Digital photograph
and (d) SEM image of the structured Ni foil.

Following the nickel foil surface nanostructuring, the growth
of
the MLG film is performed (Figure 2). To achieve desirable patterns, an NLL technique
with coordinated adjustment of laser power (380–310 mW), a
scanning speed of 1000 mm/s, and a spot size of 10 μm is provided.
We used 50 μm thick structured nickel foil as a catalyst for
MLG synthesis in the CVD system. The growth is carried out in the
mixture of argon (Ar) and hydrogen (H2) atmosphere. Methane
(CH4) is a source of carbon which arises from gas decomposition
under high temperature. Graphene patterns on the nickel foil are transferred
onto polyvinyl chloride (PVC, Sigma, lamination foils) using a lamination
technique;28 afterward, nickel is etched
in 1 M iron(III) chloride hexahydrate solution (98%, Sigma-Aldrich
item #207926).

Figure 3 demonstrates
the morphology and surface characteristics of the obtained graphene
patterns on the PVC substrate. The depth of the grooves on the MLG
surface produced via laser structuring of the Ni catalyst is gradually
reduced by decreasing the laser power for every 10 mW (Figure 3a). We observe disordering
of the graphene surface and formation of a larger number of grain
boundaries and defects. It turns out that the alignment of graphene
nanostructures directly depends on the deepness of patterns in the
Ni foil, and the resultant graphene pattern serves as a holding lattice.

error is ±5 units.

Tailoring of graphene-surface wettability and understanding
its
response to different environmental conditions are the major steps
toward the development of efficient graphene-based appliances in biosensorics.29

To characterize the surface capabilities
of graphene patterns,
we place a drop of DI on the surface of pristine and patterned MLG
(Figure 3b). Obviously,
the location of water drops indicates distinctive wettability of graphene
zones at a contact angle ≤90°(Figure 3c). Normally, single-layer graphene is hydrophilic,
which means that its WCA is ≤90° (corresponds to a high
wettability) and the graphene surface is chemically active.30 When we increase the number of graphene layers,
the WCA is about ≥90°, which corresponds to low wettability.31 It implies that the surface of MLG is hydrophobic
and consequently more inert. But in this study, we demonstrate an
opposite result—the surface of MLG is hydrophilic. Figure 3c shows the variation
of the contact angle as a function of laser power. It is observed
that the WCA increases from a value of 75° to 89.52° after
the gradual laser treatment of the MLG surface, and this value remains
nearly 90° (Figure S1 and Table S1). Although WCA data provide valuable
information on the wettability of the p-MLG surface, other surface
features—adhesion (Wpw) and surface
free energy (γp)—are the key parameters characterizing
the surface and its interaction with other materials. Besides, these
parameters are closely related not only to wettability but also to
many other important properties at the surface/interface and friction.32 Therefore, we calculated the adhesion and surface
free energy of graphene patterns based on the contact angle data by
the Young–Dupre equations:33 γw(1 + cos θ0) = Wpw and γp = γw/4(1 + cos θ0),2 where θ0 is
the contact angle at equilibrium, γw is the water
surface energy (73 mJ/m2), Wpw is the adhesion energy of water to the MLG surface, and γp is the surface free energy.

Hence, we determined that
the surface energy of p-MLG is mutually
opposite to the WCA values, and by estimating the data from Table S1, we found the highest and lowest surface
energies of the p-MLG samples—28.92 mJ/m2 (WCA =
75°) and 18.56 mJ/m2 (89.52°), respectively.
Moreover, the surface energy is caused by adhesion forces which are
the reason of formation of the surface bonds. Values of surface energy
and adhesion are always linearly proportional (Figures 3d, S2, and S3);
therefore, a higher surface energy corresponds to a higher adhesion
and vice versa. Our results indicate lower surface free energy of
all patterned graphene samples compared to the surface free energy
of water, which means that water partially wets out the graphene surface.
The graphene roughness formed by laser power treatment from 380 to
310 mW determines the increase of the WCA and the surface free energy
reduction, in other words, a degradation of the wettability and adhesion.
The surface of the graphene produced with 310 mW laser power in comparison
with the rest of the samples is more hydrophobic.

To characterize
the graphene patterns grown on various structured
Ni foils, Raman spectroscopic analysis is performed using a laser
excitation of 532 nm (Figure 4a). For single Raman measurements, 20× objective and
20 s integration time are used. The collected Raman spectra are the
typical profiles of few-layer graphere/MLG. The main G- and 2D-peaks
of graphene are clearly observed at around 1578 cm–1 (similar for all samples) and 2695–2706 cm–1, respectively. The fixed position of G-peaks (Figure 4b) indicates stability in the planar vibrational
mode of the sp2-hybridized carbon arrangement and consequently
determines the resemblance of graphene nature for all obtained patterns.
The negligible 2D band shape differences and its blue shift with decreasing
laser power during surface structuring are caused by the decrease
of the thickness/number of graphene layers34 (Figure 4b). Analyses
of the peak intensity ratio of the 2D- and G-bands are performed (Table S2 and Figure S4). The I2D/G ratio of these bands for
all graphene patterns is equal to or less than “1”,
which indicates few/multilayeredness. The appearance of a low-intensity
D-band in each case corresponds to the defect formation. Defectiveness
stimulated by a laser beam via its contact with the Ni surface is
manifested as a fingerprint of the already imperfect structure. Nevertheless,
the relatively stable I2D/G ratio in terms
of laser power and sharp symmetric 2D-bands is the confirmation for
a high-quality patterned few-layer graphene/MLG.

Variation of the sheet resistance of p-MLG as a function of laser
power. The inset shows the schematic representation of the four-point
measurement system. (d) Optical transmittance of the p-MLG on the
PVC substrate vs laser power.

Because the groove depth of the p-MLG gradually decreases,
the
graphene surface roughness increases, and the surface becomes hydrophobic
under laser treatment, the electrical transport property of graphene
can be tuned by the surface morphology of the created patterns. Thus,
the sheet resistance (Figure 4c) and optical transmittance (Figure 4d) of the p-MLG transferred on a PVC substrate
are measured, and this demonstrated that patterning reduces the sheet
resistance from 16 to 10 Ω/sq despite the fact that the obtained
p-MLG already possesses low sheet resistance (about 20 Ω/sq).
Besides, we identified a directly proportional correlation between
laser power and the sheet resistance of grown graphene patterns: each
reduction in the laser power of pattern processing reduces the sheet
resistance of the obtained p-MLG (e.g., 380 mW corresponds to 16 Ω/sq
and 310 mW corresponds to 10 Ω/sq).

A variation of optical
transmittance of the p-MLG on the PVC substrate
at around 800 nm as a function of laser power is shown in Figures 4d, S5, and S6. We observed about 1.5 times enhancement of optical
transmittance with an increase of laser power from 310 to 380 mW.
It is known that when the number of layers increases, the thickness
becomes more uniform and results in a decrease of optical transmittance.35 Apparently, the sheet thickness of the wrinkle
configuration changes—decreasing32 with applied lower laser power. It means that thinner and severe
wrinklelike ordering of graphene with deeper structuring (380 mW obtained
p-MLG) provides enhanced optical transmittance.

On the basis
of the detailed morphological and electro-optical
investigation of p-MLG samples, structures fabricated under 380 mW
are selected. Such a graphene pattern possesses a distinct structure
alignment, acting as a holding lattice which prevents defect appearance.
It provides low sheet resistance (16 Ω/sq) and higher optical
transmittance in comparison with other graphene patterns. Additionally,
the thickest 380 mW obtained p-MLG is more hydrophilic compared to
other proposed variety of patterns. The hydrophilicity provides reactivity
to graphene patterns and impacts its surface area, which will significantly
affect the performance of graphene-based devices. Therefore, we employed
380 mW obtained p-MLG for supercapacitor and Li-ion battery designs
and compared their performance with respect to the flat graphene-based
devices.

We demonstrate the optical features of a graphene-enabled
supercapacitor
behaving as an optical modulator. Figure 5a shows the schematic image of supercapacitor
preparation. The process begins with hot lamination of MLG/p-MLG with
PVC followed by etching of nickel in 1 M FeCl3·H2O solution. After the transfer-printing process, we attached
two graphene-coated PVC substrates using 250 μm thick adhesive
frames and affixed two copper wires to apply a voltage to the graphene
electrodes covered with silver-based conductive ink. The created supercapacitor
cell was filled with 50 μL of ionic liquid electrolyte [DEME][TFSI]
[98.5%, diethyl methyl(2-methoxyethyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethyl
sulfonyl)imide], Sigma-Aldrich item #727679).

Figure 5 MLG-enabled supercapacitor.
(a) Schematic image of supercapacitor
preparation: first stage—lamination with PVC at 120 °C,
second stage—etching of catalyst with 1 M iron chloride solution,
and third stage—device fabrication. Normalized change in the
transmission of a supercapacitor with (b) patterned and (c) flat MLG
electrodes using an ionic liquid as an electrolyte for bias voltage
in the range of 0–5 V.

The change of the optical transmittance of a supercapacitor
with
patterned (Figure 5b) and flat MLG electrodes (Figure 5c) is measured by using a Bruker VERTEX 70v Fourier-transform
infrared spectrometer, in which the spectral range is from 500 to
1100 nm. The optical change is performed by applying a voltage in
the range of 0–5 V for both devices; the transmission condition
is normalized at 0 V, which confirms the stability of supercapacitors.
At 0 V, the transmittance is only 1–2% for both devices and
slightly varies with the wavelength. On applying 5 V for an MLG-enabled
device, the transmittance increases sharply to 19% at 750 nm, whereas
on applying 3.5 V for p-MLG-enabled device, the transmittance increases
at first to 16% at 950 nm. At 5 V, the supercapacitor based on p-MLG
demonstrates the second stage of the transmittance increase—32%
at 800 nm.

The observed “2” times increase in
the transmittance
value of the device with p-MLG compared to that of the MLG-based device
indicates the double stepwise electrostatic doping effect on graphene,
which happened during intercalation of electrolytes: at first in the
thinner part (grooves) and then in the thicker part (wrinkles). As
a result, the transmittance enhancement occurs because of the light
beam interaction with the patterns where the p-MLG thickness is reduced—grooves
part. At this point, the light scattering decreases and light transmission
increases accordingly. Therefore, the light throughput of the p-MLG-enabled
device will be higher compared to that of the MLG-enabled device.

We also defined high modulation depths36 of about 9 and 6 dB for p-MLG- and MLG-based devices, respectively.
Because the variety of optical modulator applications is determined
by the high modulation depth (>7 dB, as high-rate interconnects
and
high-sensitivity sensing) and is limited when the modulation depth
is less than ∼4 dB (as passive mode-locking and short-distance
data transmission),37 it is crucial to
acquire the modulation depth increase. Our results indicate broader
applicability for p-MLG-enabled devices and their capability to operate
in the visible range as far as we are able to increase the modulation
depth index by 1.5 times.

Figure 6 represents
a graphene-enabled battery structured as a typical Li-ion battery.
This device posturizes a single-cell battery, where the electrodes
are sandwiched symmetrically (Figure 6a,b). As an anode, we placed MLG/p-MLG on the polymer
substrate, which acted as an electrochromic layer as well. To make
good contact, we set a copper frame attached to the graphene electrode.
Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide (known in battery manufacturing
as an NMC, Litarion) is operated as a charge counter electrode—cathode—providing
a reversible electrochemical reaction. Finally, the electrodes are
separated using a 20 μm thick porous polyethylene membrane (PE,
42% porosity, Targray) soaked with 1 M lithium hexafluorophosphate
solution in ethylene carbonate and ethyl methyl carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich
item #746738).

the symmetrically
constructed secondary battery based on the flat and (b) patterned
MLG. MLG/p-MLG acted as an electrochromic layer (anode). Lithium nickel
manganese cobalt oxide operated as a charge counter electrode (cathode),
providing a reversible electrochemical reaction in devices operating
in the transmissive/reflective modes. (c) Galvanostatic discharge/charge
curves of the MLG-based battery after 1st, 2nd, 25th, 50th, and 250th
measurements and (d) its life cycle as a function of time. (e) Voltage
profiles for the constant current charge and discharge of Li-ion batteries
incorporating MLG (green curve) and p-MLG (red curve) as negative
electrodes. The optical change results from an electric current of
≈3 mA at low dc potentials.

We measured the capacitance of the MLG-enabled Li-ion battery
approximately
250 times, demonstrating negligible decrease of its value with each
next charging/discharging cycle (Figure 6c). Inherently, all batteries gradually discharge
eventually whether they are used or not. This capacity loss is typically
caused by slow parasitic reactions occurring within the battery. The
life cycle is the key for the good performance of a battery, and thus,
increasing the life cycle is one of the first parameters that should
be focused on when aiming at providing efficiency of Li-ion batteries.
Usually, heteroatom doping, chemical impregnating, and hybridization
of graphene electrodes are the best approaches to improve the prolongation
of Li-ion batteries. For example, a graphene hybrid-based battery
can yield 400 discharge/charge cycles with 0.01% capacity loss per
cycle.38 A battery in which the graphene
electrode is impregnated with sulfur demonstrates ultralong viability
(2000 cycles and 0.028% capacity decay per cycle).39 In our case, the proposed battery with pure MLG demonstrated
operation for 1000 cycles (Figure 6d), which together with the assessed capacity (0.01%
capacity loss per cycle) demonstrates promising results.

On
the other hand, the internal charge/discharge efficiency plays
a key role as well because slow discharging and fast charging designed
in a way to reduce the impact of self-heating is required. To analyze
the battery performance, the voltage dependence of charging/discharging
processes by applying constant current (3 mA) for both devices is
provided (Figure 6e).
We observed productivity reduction in the p-MLG-based battery when
compared to the MLG-based battery because of a decrease of the charge/discharge
time by approximately “2” times. This allows us to predetermine
the viability of the p-MLG-enabled Li-ion battery during 500 cycles.
The reduction in the number of life cycles is due to the change in
the graphene surface area after the patterning procedure. In fact,
the patterns are artificially ordered defects that make graphene structure
more loosened and promote faster intercalation/deintercalation of
Li-ions. Therefore, the presented approach could lead to new bifunctional
applications combining the properties of energy storage and electrically
switchable devices.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we demonstrate
a novel NLL technique for the patterning
of MLG via Ni catalyst substrate prestructuring. NLL provides contamination-free
pattern replications into varying geometrical shapes and sizes with
a possibility to transfer p-MLG on the diverse substrates. The regulation
of hydrophobic/hydrophilic properties of graphene by various laser
power adjustments is shown. The control of hydrophobic/hydrophilic
properties defines the multifunctionality of graphene-enabled devices
due to the graphene surface (dis)ordering and, consequently, the formation
of reactive oxygen-based functional groups. The distinct graphene
structure alignment (which prevents defect appearance) assisted by
the strongest laser power (380 mW) contributes to certain p-MLG electro-optical
changes (sheet resistance decrease and optical transmittance enhancement).
The p-MLG ability to operate as an electrically reconfigurable medium
for supercapacitor and Li-ion battery designs are represented. The
p-MLG-based supercapacitor testing results reveal 2 times transmittance
value increase (in comparison with the MLG-based supercapacitor) caused
by light interaction with patterned structures where its thickness
is reduced. The p-MLG-based battery indicates long-life viability
(500 charging/discharging cycles) with 0.01% capacity loss per cycle;
the negative feedback leading toward twice the device productivity
reduction which occurred due to graphene structure loosening after
patterning and, consequently, (de)intercalation process accelerating.
We anticipate the NLL-based p-MLG to be a new approach to overcome
the limitations imposed by the existing postsynthesis processes which
will open a wide applicability gateway for advanced graphene-based
devices in energy storage, wearable electronics, and biosensorics.

Method
Summary
Nonlinear Laser Lithography
The nanostructuring setup
consists of a FS laser system, GS, and motorized 3D-S (Figure 1). The FS system is a home-made
Yb-doped fiber laser (1030 nm) which was reported before.40 It involves a dispersion-managed oscillator,
a fiber stretcher, several amplification stages and a grating compressor.
The stretcher fiber was distributed between the amplifier stages to
provide the optimal pulse peak power during amplification to balance
between the gain-narrowing and the self-phase modulation. The laser
can produce up to 1 μJ of pulse energy at a repetition rate
of 1 MHz, which corresponds to 1 W of average power. The minimal pulse
duration which can be obtained from the system is 100 fs. Because
the output light of the laser is linearly polarized, the HWP placed
between the laser and the polarization beam splitter provides control
of the laser power on the sample. The second HWP allows the control
of polarization on a sample. The sample was placed on the motorized
3D stage in the focal plane of the GS f-theta lens.

The laser
beam was scanned over the nickel surface in the way that during every
line scan it was partially overlapped with the already created structure.
In this way we preserved the concept of nonlinear laser lithography,22 which allows coherent extension of the created
structure over a large area surface, thus, improving the quality of
the structure. The maximum scanning area for our model of GS is 1
× 1 cm2. To extend the area, XY translation stage
was used. With the given pulse energy and repetition rate, the processing
speed in our work was as fast as 15 s for 1 × 1 cm2 area. It can be increased in the future by scaling the repetition
rate of the laser by keeping the pulse energy constant, that is, simultaneously
scaling the average power.

CVD Growth of Multilayer Graphene
A CVD system was
used for the growth of MLG. The growth process was carried out under
ambient pressure in a 3″ quartz tube furnace, using 50 μm
thick Ni foil. Argon gas was flushed into the quartz tube for at least
5 min to remove oxygen. Afterward, hydrogen was supplied while argon
continued to run (ratio of Ar/H2 is about 100/100 sccm).
The gas-filled CVD system was left for heating till the temperature
is raised to 1000 °C. Once 1000 °C temperature was reached,
the methane flow is established at 30 sccm together with the Ar/H2 flow at 100/100 sccm, followed by a waiting time of 5 min.
In the end, the CH4 flow is turned off and the system is
cooled down to room temperature in ∼1 h while keeping the Ar/H2 flow environment at 100/100 sccm.

Transfer Printing of Multilayer
Graphene
The following
steps are needed for the analysis of the MLG/p-MLG surface and fabrication
of graphene-enabled devices after CVD growth on a Ni foil. First,
one side of the graphene-covered Ni foil was protected by paper, whereas
the other side was in contact with PVC. Second, the patch of paper/graphene/Ni/graphene/PVC
was sent through a lamination machine with a temperature of about
120 °C. The obtained PVC/graphene/Ni samples were then dipped
in a 1 M FeCl2 aqueous etching solution for a few hours.
After the nickel was etched, the PVC/graphene membranes were placed
in DI for a few hours and rinsed as well. Then, the samples were blow-dried
with N2 gas and were ready to use.

Characterization Methods
WCA of the MLG/p-MLG on PVC
substrate was obtained using a home-made contact angle measurement
setup. The setup consists of the following elements: a white LED,
XYZ translation stage with standard micrometers (Thorlabs), video
camera (Thorlabs, DCC1645C-USB 2.0 CMOS camera, 1280 × 1024,
color sensor), and usual medical syringe with a 200 μm diameter
needle. We put a DI water droplet of 4 μL on the investigated
graphene surface and took digital photographs. We measured the contact
angles using a program Screen Protractor which allows us to easily
and quickly measure any angle on the screen to the nearest degree.
The morphological analyses of the investigated graphene samples were
performed using scanning electron microscopy (Nova NanoSEM 600). To
determine the graphitization fingerprint and compare the defectiveness
of MLG and p-MLG surfaces, a Jobin Yvon HORIBA Raman microscope system
with 20× microscope objectives and 20 s integration time was
used. The excitation wavelength was 532 nm. The transmittance measurements
in the wavelength range between 450 and 1100 nm were performed by
using a Bruker VERTEX 70v Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer
integrated with a Si photodiode. The sheet resistance measurements
were carried out at four probe station platforms with the support
of a Keithley 2600 multimeter. MLG was attached on the patterned area
to make Ohmic contact with the four electrodes. Then, sheet resistance
was calculated using the standard formula (Rs = πR/ln 2 ≈ 4.53R).

Optical measurements
were performed in the 450–1100 nm wavelength range by a Bruker
VERTEX 70v Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer equipped with a
Si photodiode. Transmittance, Tp(λ),
spectra were recorded by graphene-based supercapacitors biased using
the Keithley 2400 Source measure unit.

Graphene-Enabled Li-Ion
Battery
The voltage and time
readings of charging/discharging processes were generated using the
Keithley 2600 Source Meter instrument. The data were collected under
a constant current of 3 mA and processed with LabVIEW software.
