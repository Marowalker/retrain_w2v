Protein
Z (PZ)-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI) and antithrombin (AT) are two physiological
serpin inhibitors involved in the regulation of proteolytic activities
of the blood coagulation cascade. ZPI has restricted protease specificity
capable of inhibiting factors Xa (FXa) and XIa (FXIa) but exhibiting
no reactivity with other coagulation proteases. Unlike ZPI, AT is
a general inhibitor of all coagulation proteases and the only physiological
inhibitor of factor IXa (FIXa). To understand the molecular determinants
of protease specificity of the two serpins, we engineered two ZPI
mutants in which the P12-P3′ residues of the reactive center
loop of ZPI were replaced with either P12-P3′ or P12-P7′
residues of AT (ZPI–ATP12-P3′ and
ZPI–ATP12-P7′). The reactivity of
chimeras with FXa was improved ∼4–25-fold in the absence
of PZ. Both chimeras inhibited FIXa with rate constants that were
∼2 orders of magnitude higher than the rate of the AT inhibition
of the protease. PZ improved the reactivity of chimeras with FIXa
by another 2 orders of magnitude, rendering the chimeras potent inhibitors
of FIXa so that the PZ-mediated inhibitory activity of the ZPI–AT
chimeras toward FIXa was ∼20-fold higher than that of the fondaparinux-catalyzed
inhibition of FIXa by AT. Further studies revealed that the substitution
of P1-Tyr of ZPI with an Arg is sufficient to convert the serpin to
an effective inhibitor of FIXa. The potential therapeutic utility
of the serpin chimeras as specific inhibitors of FIXa was diminished
by findings that the chimeras function as effective substrates for
other coagulation proteases.

==== Body
Introduction
The two serpin inhibitors antithrombin
(AT) and protein Z (PZ)-dependent
protease inhibitor (ZPI) regulate the proteolytic activity of coagulation
proteases of the blood clotting cascade.1−4 In contrast to AT which is a universal serpin
inhibitor of all coagulation proteases of both intrinsic and extrinsic
pathways,1,2 ZPI is a specific inhibitor of factors Xa
(FXa) and XIa (FXIa) and exhibits no significant reactivity with other
coagulation proteases.3,4 Both AT and ZPI require cofactors
for their optimal inhibitory activity toward their specific target
proteases. Whereas heparin functions as a cofactor to promote the
inhibitory activity of both serpins,1,2 PZ functions
as a cofactor to specifically enhance the reactivity of ZPI with FXa
on negatively charged phospholipids in the presence of calcium.3,4 AT is the only physiological inhibitor of factor IXa (FIXa). The
reactivity of FIXa with AT in the absence of heparin cofactors is
low, exhibiting a second-order rate constant that is ∼40-fold
lower than that of the reactivity of the serpin with FXa.5 Nevertheless, the cofactor function of the therapeutic
heparins improves the reactivity of FIXa with AT by several orders
of magnitude by both conformational activation of the serpin and a
template mechanism.6,7 It has been hypothesized that
a small fraction of glycosaminoglycans lining the vasculature contains
3-O-sulfate containing heparin-like sequences that
can also function as cofactors to activate the serpin, thereby improving
the reactivity of AT with FIXa, FXa, and other coagulation proteases
by similar mechanisms.8 In the case of
ZPI, PZ functions as a vitamin K-dependent cofactor to promote the
inhibitory activity of the serpin with FXa on negatively charged phospholipid
vesicles and calcium.9 The complex formation
of ZPI with PZ improves the reactivity of the serpin with FXa by at
least 3 orders of magnitude under these conditions.10,11 In a study published several years ago, it was reported that ZPI
can also inhibit FIXa, although subsequent studies did not confirm
the initial findings.12 In a recent study,
we investigated the molecular basis for the lack of reactivity of
FIXa with ZPI and demonstrated that residues of the 39-loop (also
referred to as 37-loop) restrict the ZPI specificity of FIXa.13 Thus, we discovered that a FIXa mutant, in which
the residues of this loop were replaced with the corresponding residues
of FXa, reacted with the ZPI–PZ complex with a similar second-order
rate constant as did FXa on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles
in the presence of calcium.13 This was
surprising because unlike AT that has an Arg at the P1 position (nomenclature
of Schechter and Berger)14 of the reactive
center loop (RCL), ZPI contains a Tyr at this position, yet the serpin
could effectively inhibit the FIXa mutant, suggesting that structural
differences between residues of the 39-loop are primarily responsible
for the differential reactivity of the two proteases with ZPI and
that FIXa can similarly accommodate a Tyr at its primary specificity
pocket.13

To further investigate
the determinants of the specificity of coagulation
proteases with the two serpins, we replaced the RCL residues of ZPI
from P12-P3′ with the corresponding P12-P3′ and P12-P7′
residues of AT in two separate constructs (ZPI–ATP12-P3′ and ZPI–ATP12-P7′). The rationale
for constructing two serpin chimeras with different RCL lengths was
that relative to ZPI and most other serpins the RCL of AT is longer
by three residues on the P′ site of the loop (P4′ is
a Pro in both serpins and P5′-P7′ residues of AT are
not conserved in ZPI). Following purification to homogeneity, the
reactivity of serpin chimeras with coagulation proteases was evaluated
in the absence and presence of PZ on negatively charged phospholipid
vesicles. Analysis of results demonstrate that grafting either P12-P3′
or P12-P7′ of AT on ZPI renders chimeric serpins as inhibitors
of FIXa and that PZ markedly improves the reactions. ZPI–ATP12-P3′ inhibits FXa with an 8-fold higher rate
constant than ZPI–ATP12-P7′, suggesting
that the length of RCL is important for FXa inhibition by the serpins.
Grafting three P5′-P7′ insertion residues of AT to the
corresponding sites of ZPI also decreased the high reactivity of the
ZPI mutant with FXa. Both ZPI chimeras functioned as substrates rather
than inhibitors for both FXIa and thrombin.

Results and Discussion
Expression
and Characterization of ZPI–AT Chimeras
The ZPI–AT
chimeras were expressed in Escherichia
coli using the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO)
fusion expression system and purified to homogeneity on a nickel column
as described.15,16 The homogeneity of all expressed
proteins was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (see below). The k2 values for the inhibition of FXa by the ZPI chimeras in both
the absence and presence of PZ are presented in Table 1. In agreement with previously published
results,16 wild-type ZPI (ZPI-WT) inhibited
FXa with an apparent k2 (k2(app)) of 3.3 × 103 M–1 s–1 and an inhibition stoichiometry (SI) value
of 4.7, yielding an overall second-order rate constant (k2(app) × SI) of 1.6 × 104 M–1 s–1. PZ promoted the ZPI inhibition of FXa (29.3
× 105 M–1 s–1)
by ∼3 orders of magnitude in the presence of PC/PS vesicles
and decreased the cleavage rate of the serpin with FXa ∼2-fold,
yielding an overall second-order rate constant of 8.2 × 106 M–1 s–1 (Table 1). ZPI–ATP12-P3′ exhibited ∼7–8-fold improved k2(app) of inhibition and ∼4-fold higher SI value; thus,
the overall rate constant for the ZPI–ATP12-P3′ inhibition of FXa (43 × 104 M–1 s–1) relative to ZPI-WT (and ZPI–ATP12-P7′) was enhanced ∼25–30-fold.
This enhancement in the reactivity of the chimeric serpin with FXa
is primarily due to the presence of a P1-Arg on the RCL of chimera
rather than a P1-Tyr on the RCL of ZPI-WT. The substitution of P1-Tyr
with an Arg (P1-Y/R) by itself has been shown to dramatically improve
the reactivity of the mutant with FXa; however, the serpin mutant
cannot inhibit FXa but functions as an effective substrate for the
protease.4 The same results were observed
in this study (data not shown). Thus, P1-Arg in the context of the
AT RCL can endow inhibitory function to the chimeric serpin in the
reaction with FXa, although also markedly increasing its reactivity
in the substrate pathway. In contrast to the ZPI–ATP12-P3′ chimera, the k2(app) for the ZPI–ATP12-P7′ inhibition of FXa was not improved but
rather slightly decreased, suggesting that the three P5′-P7′
insertion residues of the longer RCL of AT impede its optimal interaction
with FXa. This finding is consistent with the mutagenesis data showing
that the deletion of these insertion residues from the AT RCL improves
the reactivity of the AT mutant with FXa independent of pentasaccharide,
suggesting that these insertion residues may be responsible for trapping
the RCL of AT in a low inhibitory conformation. The native low inhibitory
conformation of the AT RCL is thought to be due to the partial insertion
of the hinge region of the loop (P14 and P15 residues) into β-sheet
A of the serpin and that the cofactor function of heparin leads to
expulsion of the loop and thus conformational activation of AT.17 It should be noted that a longer RCL is required
for the serpin inhibition of thrombin because deletion of these residues
impairs the reactivity of the AT mutant with thrombin.18 It appears that the three insertion residues
of the AT RCL confer a canonical conformation for this loop to enable
AT to interact with thrombin19 and that
the low inhibitory activity of the longer RCL in AT in the reaction
with FXa and FIXa is overcome by the cofactor function of heparin
through conformational activation of AT, thereby allowing the serpin
to make exosite-dependent interactions with the latter two proteases.13,20,21 Thus, the shorter RCL in the
ZPI–ATP12-P3′ chimera is likely making
exosite-dependent interactions with FXa, possibly accounting for its
higher reactivity with FXa. Exosite interactions appear to be also
important for the ZPI reaction with FXa and therefore modifying the
RCL length in ZPI might be expected to affect such interactions and
account for differences in the reactivity. In support of this hypothesis,
grafting the three P5′-P7′ insertion residues of AT
to the same site of ZPI (ZPI–ATNRV) dramatically
reduced the reactivity of the serpin mutant with FXa without affecting
the magnitude of the cofactor function of PZ (Table 1). It is interesting to note that the overall
rate constant for the ZPI–ATP12-P3′ reaction with FXa (43 × 104 M–1 s–1, including the increased reactivity in the
substrate pathway) is similar to the reactivity of AT with FXa in
the presence of pentasaccharide. Nevertheless, the improved reactivity
of the ZPI–ATP12-P3′ chimera with
FXa (relative to ZPI-WT) vanished in the presence of PZ, suggesting
that the cofactor function of PZ may primarily be responsible for
overcoming the nonoptimal binding of a P1-Tyr of ZPI to the primary
specificity pocket of FXa.

Reaction of ZPI–AT Chimeras with FIXa
The examination
of the reactivity of the ZPI–AT chimeras revealed that both
chimeras are capable of inhibiting FIXa with a rate constant that
is nearly 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the AT inhibition
(6 × 101 M–1 s–1) of the protease (Table 2). To further characterize the extent of the reactivity of
FIXa with the chimeric serpins, first the SI values for the protease
inhibition by ZPI chimeras were determined. The results presented
in Figure 1 suggest
that the two ZPI–ATP12-P3′ and ZPI–ATP12-P7′ chimeras inhibit FIXa with SI values
of ∼4 and ∼6, respectively. Similar values have been
observed for the ZPI-WT inhibition of FXa.16 Interestingly, the substitution of P1-Tyr of ZPI with an Arg (P1-Y/R)
was sufficient to dramatically improve the reactivity of the ZPI mutant
with FIXa (k2(app) = 2.1 × 103 M–1 s–1), thus yielding
an overall k2(app) × SI of ∼1
× 104 M–1 s–1,
a rate constant that nearly approaches the reactivity of FIXa with
the pentasaccharide-activated conformation of AT.13 Furthermore, PZ accelerated the reactivity of the chimeric
serpins with FIXa by another 2 orders of magnitude in the presence
of PC/PS vesicles, thus the overall k2(app) value approaching 106 M–1 s–1 (Table 2). These
results clearly suggest that the P1-Tyr of ZPI is responsible for
restricting the specificity of the serpin with FIXa. It is however
surprising to note that PZ cannot overcome, at least partially, the
restrictive function of P1-Tyr in the ZPI inhibition of FIXa. In a
previous study, we showed that the substitution of the 39-loop of
FIXa with the corresponding loop of FXa renders the FIXa mutant susceptible
to rapid inhibition by ZPI-WT with a rate constant similar to that
observed for the ZPI inhibition of FXa in both the absence and presence
of PZ and negatively charged phospholipid vesicles.13 This observation suggests that the 39-loop of FIXa impedes
the entrance of the bulky hydrophobic Tyr ring of ZPI-WT into the
active-site pocket of the protease. The ZPI–ATNRV chimera, similar to ZPI-WT, was not reactive with FIXa because it
retained the P1-Tyr.

In light of the
high inhibitory activities of the ZPI–AT
chimeras toward FIXa, we postulated that the chimeric serpins might
have therapeutic value in inhibiting FIXa in thrombosis patients.
Nevertheless, before initiating translational research, we first assessed
the protease inhibitory activity of one of the chimeras (ZPI–ATP12-P7′) in the aPTT clotting assay. Surprisingly,
no differences between the anticoagulant activities of ZPI-WT and
ZPI–ATP12-P7′ could be observed in
normal plasma (data not shown). To make the aPTT assay more sensitive
for monitoring FIXa inhibition, the anticoagulant activity of the
ZPI chimera was also evaluated in AT-deficient plasma or FX-deficient
plasma, which was supplemented with an FX autolysis mutant having
normal prothrombinase activity but markedly reduced reactivity with
ZPI when the zymogen mutant is activated to FXa.20,22 As presented in Figure 2A, an equal concentration of ZPI-WT (2.5 μM) exhibited
more potent protease inhibitory activity than that of both wild-type
AT and the ZPI chimera in the aPTT assay, as evidenced by ZPI-WT prolonging
the plasma clotting time more efficiently than both AT and the chimeric
serpin. Similarly, results obtained in FX-deficient plasma indicated
that ZPI-WT has more effective anticoagulant activity than that of
the chimeric serpin (Figure 2B). Taken together, these results suggested that the ZPI–AT
chimera may be cleaved by a protease upstream of FIXa (most likely
by FXIa) in the intrinsic pathway. To investigate this question further,
the reactivity of the ZPI–AT chimeras with FXIa was evaluated.
Results suggested that the chimeras cannot inhibit FXIa and that no
SI values for the inhibition of the protease by either one of the
ZPI chimeras can be determined. Thus, the complex formation of chimeric
serpins with FXIa and other coagulation proteases was assessed by
SDS-PAGE.

Clotting time of AT-deficient plasma supplemented with AT, ZPI-WT,
or ZPI–ATP12-P7′ (2.5 μM each)
was determined at 37 °C by an aPTT assay. (B) Same as (A) except
that the clotting time of FX-deficient plasma, supplemented with a
FX mutant exhibiting low reactivity with ZPI, was determined in the
presence of either ZPI-WT or ZPI–ATP12-P7′ (2.5 μM each) at 37 °C. In all measurements, 0.05 mL
of serpin was incubated with 0.05 mL of plasma and 0.05 mL of aPTT
reagent (Alexin) for 5 min followed by the initiation of clotting
by addition of 0.05 mL of 35 mM CaCl2 as described under Experimental Procedures.

Analysis of Stable Complex Formation
SDS-PAGE analyses
of complex formation of ZPI–AT chimeras with coagulation proteases
are presented in Figures 3–6. As expected from the inhibition kinetic data, unlike ZPI-WT,
both ZPI–AT chimeras formed stable complexes with FIXa (Figure 3A,B under nonreducing
and reducing conditions). In agreement with elevated SI values, some
cleavage products were also observed with both chimeric serpins. In
the case of FXa, stoichiometric incubation of FXa with the chimeras
(3 μM each) did not yield any stable serpin–protease
complex but the chimeras were cleaved by the protease. Thus, we titrated
a fixed concentration of the chimeric serpins (3 μM) with substoichiometric
concentrations of FXa (0–1000 nM). The results suggested that
FXa effectively cleaves both serpin mutants (Figure 4). These results are consistent with markedly
higher SI values obtained for FXa in the kinetic experiments (Table 1). Under similar conditions,
no significant serpin cleavage products could be detected for the
reactions of the serpin chimeras with FIXa (data not shown). Similar
to FXa, thrombin effectively cleaved both chimeric serpins so that
no significant stable protease–serpin complex could be detected
if an equimolar concentration of thrombin and serpin (3 μM each)
was analyzed on the SDS-PAGE (Figure 5A). Similarly, titrating a fixed concentration of the
ZPI–AT chimeras (3 μM) with substoichiometric concentrations
of thrombin (0–1000 nM) suggested that the fusion of the AT
RCL to ZPI dramatically increases the reactivity of the chimeric serpin
with thrombin in the substrate pathway of the reaction (Figure 5B,C). Interestingly, similar
experiments with FXIa revealed that both chimeric serpins have become
effective substrates for the protease such that a very low concentration
of FXIa (1 nM) was sufficient to cleave the chimeric serpins (Figure 6), accounting for
the inability to calculate the SI values for the inhibition of FXIa
by the chimeric serpins. The rapid cleavage of the serpin chimeras
by FXIa also explains the basis for the inability of chimera to prolong
the clotting time in the aPTT assay when compared to that of ZPI-WT
(Figure 2). Thus, although
the serpin chimeras exhibit high inhibitory properties toward FIXa,
they, nevertheless, do not offer a therapeutic value in their current
forms unless further mutagenesis strategies are developed to eliminate
their high reactivity with FXIa in the substrate pathway of the reaction.

Serpins inhibit their
target serine proteases by a branched pathway,
suicide substrate inhibition mechanism in which an intermediate enzyme–serpin
complex is stabilized in the form of an acylated covalent complex.23 Noting that the reaction mechanism of the serine
proteases with their true substrates and serpins is nearly identical
up to the acylation step of the reaction, the differences between
the rates of RCL insertion into β-sheet A and deacylation determine
the faith of the enzyme–serpin intermediate complex in the
reaction. If the rate of RCL insertion is faster, the intermediate
is trapped as a stable covalent complex, but if the deacylation rate
is faster, the intermediate is cleaved as a substrate.24 Thus, SI values represent the relative rate
of partitioning of the protease–serpin intermediate in the
branched pathway to either a covalent stable complex or a cleaved
serpin. The molecular basis for the conversion of ZPI–AT chimeras
to effective substrates for FXIa and thrombin and their high reactivity
with FXa in the substrate pathway is not known. The reactivity of
wild-type AT with either FXIa (k2(app) = 3 × 102 M–1 s–1) or FIXa (6 × 101 M–1 s–1) is rather low in the absence of heparin cofactors. Assuming that
the primary determinants of the specificity of the protease
recognition by AT is mediated through the RCL and the fact that the
entire RCL of AT (with the exception of the proximal hinge region
residues) is fused to ZPI (Figure 7), one would have expected that FXIa and FIXa would
react with the ZPI–AT chimeras with similar low k2(app) values as they do with AT. However, the results
are not in agreement with this expectation and they may suggest that
interactions other than the RCL residues in ZPI also contribute to
the specificity of the reaction with these proteases. ZPI has a highly
acidic N-terminal tail (52 residues) on the A-helix that is not conserved
in other serpins (4). The possibility that this acidic tail contributes
to interaction of ZPI chimeras with these proteases is not supported
by our previous results, showing that the deletion of the acidic tail
of ZPI does not affect the reactivity of the serpin with its target
proteases in either the inhibitory or substrate pathway.16 The fact that the SI values for the ZPI–AT
chimeras with all coagulation proteases are markedly elevated clearly
suggests that the rate of loop insertion in the chimeric serpins is
slower than the rate of deacylation. In light of the importance of
the residues of the hinge region and differences in the structure
of these residues between the two serpins, it is possible that the
hinge region residues of ZPI are not compatible with comparable rapid
loop insertion in the chimeric serpins (Figure 7). Of particular note is the presence of
P16-Glu in AT (25), which is an Arg in the corresponding site of ZPI.4 The role of this residue in the mechanics of
loop insertion in the context of the AT RCL in ZPI needs to be investigated
to determine whether it contributes to the slower rate of loop insertion
in the chimeric serpins. Noting that the SI values for the ZPI-WT
with its two target proteases are also high (∼5 and 10 for
FXa and FXIa, respectively), one might postulate that, relative to
AT and other serpins, ZPI has an intrinsically slower loop insertion
rate during interaction with its target coagulation proteases. It
is also worth noting that the conformation of the AT RCL is allosterically
linked to the hinge region, the shutter region, and the heparin-binding
D-helix of the serpin.17,26 These structural features in
AT are known to control the flexibility of the RCL and its inhibitory
mechanism. These structural features are not expected to be transferred
to ZPI when the AT RCL is grafted on the chimeric serpins, possibly
accounting for the inflexibility of the grafted RCL as well as its
noninhibitory and substrate properties in the reaction with coagulation
proteases. However, it was interesting to note that the serpin chimeras
could effectively inhibit FIXa in the presence of PZ, possibly suggesting
that the deacylation step of the intermediate in the FIXa reaction
with the chimeric serpins is slower than that of other coagulation
proteases, thus compensating for the slower rate of loop insertion
in the chimeric serpins.

Figure 7 X-ray crystal structures of ZPI and AT. The
P12-P3′ residues
of the RCL in ZPI are colored in purple. The P12-P7′ residues
of the RCL in AT including the three insertion residues (N-R-V) are
shown in purple. The P1 residue and the hinge region for both serpins
are marked. The coordinates (Protein Data Bank accession code 2BEH for AT and 3H5C for ZPI) were used
to prepare the figure.

Experimental Procedures
Expression and Purification of Recombinant
Proteins
The expression, purification, and characterization
of ZPI-WT, prepared
in E. coli using the SUMO fusion expression
system, have been described previously.15,16 The RCL chimeric
mutant of ZPI in which the P12-P3′ residues of ZPI (Ala-Val-Ala-Gly-Ile-Leu-Ser-Glu-Ile-Thr-Ala-Tyr-Ser-Met-Pro)
were replaced with the corresponding residues of AT (Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-Gly-Arg-Ser-Leu-Asn)
(ZPI–ATP12-P3′) was constructed by
standard PCR mutagenesis methods and expressed using the same vector
system as described.16 The same vector
system was used to express another ZPI chimera in which the P12-P3′
residues of the RCL were replaced with the P12-P7′ residues
of AT (Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Thr-Ala-Val-Val-Ile-Ala-Gly-Arg-Ser-Leu-Asn-Pro-Asn-Arg-Val)
(ZPI–ATP12-P7′). Two other ZPI mutants
were prepared, in one of which the P1-Tyr of the serpin was replaced
with an Arg (P1-Y/R) and in the other the AT RCL residues from P5′-P7′
(Asn-Arg-Val) were inserted after the native P4′ (Pro) residue
of ZPI (ZPI–ATNRV).18,25 The concentrations
of ZPI derivatives were calculated from their absorbance at 280 nm
using a molar absorption coefficient of 31 525 M–1 cm–1 as described.27 The expression, purification, and characterization of PZ in HEK-293
cells have been described.10 The homogeneity
of all recombinant proteins was verified by SDS-PAGE.

Human
plasma protein factors IXa (FIXa), Xa (FXa), XIa (FXIa), AT, and thrombin
were purchased from Haematologic Technologies Inc. (Essex Junction,
VT). Phospholipid vesicles containing 80% phosphatidylcholine and
20% phosphatidylserine (PC/PS) were prepared as described.28 Normal pooled human plasma and FX-deficient
plasma were purchased from George King Bio-Medical, Inc. (Overland
Park, KS). Human AT-deficient plasma was purchased from Affinity Biological
Inc. (Ontario, Canada). The activated partial thromboplastin time
(aPTT) reagent (Alexin) was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
Chromogenic substrates S2276, S2238, and S2366 were purchased from
Diapharma (West Chester, OH), and CBS 31.39 was purchased from Midwest
Bio-Tech. Inc. (Fishers, IN).

Inhibition Assays
A discontinuous assay method was
used to measure the second-order associate rate constants (k2) for the ZPI inhibition of all coagulation
proteases under pseudo-first-order conditions in both the absence
and presence of PZ as described.13,16 Briefly, each
protease (1 nM FXa, 10 nM FIXa, 2 nM thrombin, and 1 nM FXIa) was
incubated with ZPI (500–2000 nM) in 0.1 M NaCl, 0.02 M Tris–HCl,
pH 7.5, and 5 mM Ca2+ containing 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 0.1%
poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 8000 (TBS/Ca2+) at room temperature.
All reactions were carried out in 50 μL volumes in 96-well plates
and at different time points (15–120 min depending on the rate
of the reactions) and microliters of the chromogenic substrate specific for each protease
(S2276 for FXa, CBS 31.39 for FIXa, S2366 for FXIa, and S2238 for
thrombin) in TBS was added to each well; the remaining activities
of enzymes were measured by a Vmax Kinetics
Microplate Reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). The rate constants
(k2) were determined from the values of
observed pseudo-first-order rate constants (kobs) divided by the concentration of serpins as described.13,16 Reactions in the presence of PZ were the same except that the proteases
were incubated with ZPI (100–200 nM) in complex with PZ (2.5–5.0
nM) on PC/PS vesicles (50 μM) in the same TBS buffer. The inactivation
reactions were stopped by addition of 50 μL of the chromogenic
substrate in TBS containing 50 mM EDTA, and k2 values were measured from the remaining enzyme activity as
described.13 All values are presented as
the average of at least three independent measurements ± SD.

Determination of SI
SI values for the inhibition of
coagulation proteases by the ZPI derivatives were determined by titration
of 10–250 nM of active-site-titrated protease with increasing
concentrations of the serpin–cofactor complex corresponding
to serpin/protease molar ratios of 0–20 and a PZ concentration
equal to or 2-fold in molar excess of ZPI. The reactions were carried
out in TBS/Ca2+ containing 50 μM PC/PS and the residual
amidolytic activity of proteases was measured using the specific chromogenic
substrates as described above. After completion of the inhibition
reactions, the serpin/protease ratios were plotted versus the residual
activity of the protease and the SI values were determined from the
x-intercept of the linear regression fit of the inhibition data as
described.16

Analysis of the Stable
Serpin–Protease Complex Formation
Complex formation
of coagulation proteases with the serpins was
monitored by SDS-PAGE as described.13 The
reaction was carried out in 20 μL volume using 3 μM ZPI
and equimolar concentration of the protease in TBS/Ca2+. Following incubation at different times at room temperature, 5
μL of a 5× reducing or nonreducing loading buffer was added
and the samples were loaded on a 10% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie
Blue R-250 as described.13 Under the conditions
where the SI values were determined to be very high, the cleavage
of the serpin chimeras was monitored at lower concentrations of coagulation
proteases (1 nM to 1 μM).

Plasma Clotting Assay
The anticoagulant activity of
the serpin chimeras in plasma was evaluated in an aPTT assay using
normal plasma, FX-deficient plasma, and AT-deficient plasma and a
STart 4 fibrinometer (Diagnostica/Stago, Asnieres, France). Briefly,
0.050 mL of TBS containing 2.5 μM final concentrations of ZPI-WT
or the chimera was incubated with a mixture of 0.05 mL normal plasma,
AT-deficient plasma, or FX-deficient plasma, supplemented with an
autolysis loop mutant of FX, which when activated exhibits very poor
reactivity with ZPI,22 plus 0.05 mL of
the aPTT reagent (Alexin) for 5 min before the initiation of clotting
by the addition of 0.05 mL of 35 mM CaCl2 at 37 °C.
The FXa autolysis loop mutant has a normal prothrombinase activity.20
