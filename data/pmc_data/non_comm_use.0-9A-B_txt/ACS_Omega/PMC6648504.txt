The purpose of this study was to
evaluate the solubilities and
physicochemical properties of solid dispersions of daidzein (DDZ)
and genistein (GST) (the major isoflavones in soybeans) in γ-cyclodextrin
(γCD). Dispersions were prepared in distilled water using a
three-dimensional ball mill (3DGMw). Phase solubility diagrams confirmed
that DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD formed AL type inclusion
complexes with a molar ratio of 1:1. A new peak due to inclusion complexes
was observed in the results of powder X-ray diffraction (3DGMw(DDZ/γCD
= 1:1) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD = 1:1)). Dissolution tests using distilled
water found that solubilities of 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD = 1:1) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD
= 1:1) were approximately 37- and 51-fold higher, respectively, than
the solubilities of pure DDZ and GST. These observations are expected
to expand the usefulness of cogrinding of DDZ or GST with γCD
using a three-dimensional ball mill.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Soybeans and soy products
are plant-based foods extensively used
worldwide. Soy products contain isoflavones, which have structures
similar to the female hormone estrogen and which show estrogenic action.1 Soy isoflavones have been reported to promote
osteoplasty2 and reduce negative symptoms
of menopause.3 Therefore, soy isoflavones
are used as dietary supplements or food for specified health promoting
effects. Two aglycon-type isoflavones present at relatively high concentrations
in soy products are daidzein (DDZ) and genistein (GST). DDZ can reduce
the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease,4 and GST is useful for chemoprevention of prostatic cancer.5 The improvement of dispersibility in water and
the improvement of bioavailability are required for a more effective
use of DDZ and GST since DDZ and GST have poor water solubility, low
stability, and low bioavailability.

γ Cyclodextrin (γCD)
is a complex cylindrical molecule
with eight glucose molecules bonded by α1–4 linkages.
Cyclodextrins have cavities in their cyclic structures and are known
to form inclusion complexes that harbor other molecules,6 thereby improving the solubility7 and stability8 of various pharmaceuticals.
For example, formation of inclusion complexes between γCD and
catechins has been reported.9 Various methods
for preparing inclusion complexes, including coprecipitation,10 kneading,11 freeze
drying,12 and cogrinding13 have been reported. Cogrinding is a method of forming inclusion
complexes by mechanochemical means under solvent-free conditions,
changing the bonding state between two solids and the physicochemical
properties of each.14

Cogrinding
methods using a rod mill, a ball mill, a jet mill, and
so on have been developed. The preparation of inclusion complexes
of caffeic acid/γCD by cogrinding using a rod mill has been
reported.15 Using the ball mill, it is
possible to micronize foods and tea.16 The
use of a jet mill for grinding of drugs has been reported.17 The vibrating rod mill generates heat in the
grinding process due to the mechanochemical effect. A ball mill with
two-axis rotation is a type of grinder used to grind and blend materials
for drug formulation. The three-dimensional (3D) ball mill has longitudinal
and transverse rotational axes, enabling mixing and grinding with
high uniformity. The preparation of cocrystals of ibuprofen and nicotinamide
using a three-dimensional ball mill has been reported.18 This unique grinding will operate continuously
for long periods of time for powder processing. On the other hand,
three-dimension ball milling is a novel grinding method that rotates
in three axes. The characteristics are that it is possible to grind
the drug and the material efficiently and that it does not generate
heat during further grinding. In addition, there has been no report
on the preparation of a ground mixture by a novel three-dimension
ball mill for an inclusion complex of drug and cyclodextrin. Therefore,
if it is possible to prepare inclusion complexes by a three-dimensional
ball mill, this will lead to expanded application of the pharmaceutical
preparation method.

Use of a three-dimensional ball mill may
permit the preparation
of new types of hybrid solid dispersions.

Inclusion complexes
of DDZ/βCD and GST/βCD have been
reported.19 To date, the preparation of
inclusion complexes of DDZ and GST using other CDs has not been reported.
Therefore, we prepared solid dispersions using γCD with the
aim of further improving DDZ and GST solubility. The aim of the current
study was to evaluate the physicochemical properties and solubilities
of DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD inclusion complexes prepared by
cogrinding using a three-dimensional ball mill.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Phase Solubility Studies
Phase solubility
diagrams were obtained to determine molar ratios and stability constants
of DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD inclusion complexes. The solubility
of DDZ alone was 1.39 μg/mL and that of GST alone was 2.54 μg/mL
after 24 h of shaking. Phase solubility diagrams indicate that the
solubilities of DDZ and GST increase linearly with the addition of
γCD. The inclusions formed are type AL according
to the classification of Higuchi et al. (Figure 1). AL-type inclusions indicate
a guest molecule and host molecule interaction with a molar ratio
of 1:1. It is suggested that DDZ and GST form 1:1 inclusion complexes
with γCD in solution. Stability constant (K) was 220.85 M–1 for DDZ and 1378.12 M–1 for GST. GST is thought to form more stable inclusion complexes
within γCD than DDZ since the stability constant of GST is larger
than that of DDZ.

were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3).

2.2 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC)
Phase solubility diagrams suggested that
DDZ/γCD
and GST/γCD complexes had 1:1 molar ratios in the aqueous solution.
Solid dispersions of DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD were prepared
using a three-dimensional ball mill at molar ratio of 1:1. In most
reports, inclusion complex formation changes thermal behaviors, leading
to disappearance of or shift in the melting points of guest molecules.22 DSC was performed to investigate the thermal
behavior of 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) prepared
using a three-dimensional ball mill. Endothermic peaks due to melting
were observed at 337 °C for DDZ alone and at 301 °C for
GST alone (Figure 2a,b). In PM(DDZ/γCD) and PM(GST/γCD), DDZ and GST crystals
are considered since endothermic peaks from the melting of DDZ and
GST were observed at 320 and 299 °C, respectively (Figure 2d,e). Endothermic peaks from
DDZ and GST were observed at 308 °C in GM(DDZ/γCD) and
305 °C in GM(GST/γCD) (Figure 2f,g). In 3DGMnw(DDZ/γCD), endothermic
peaks from DDZ and GST were confirmed at 313 °C in 3DGMnw(DDZ/γCD)
and 317 °C in 3DGMnw(GST/γCD) (Figure 2h,i). Endothermic peaks from DDZ and GST
disappeared in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) (Figure 2j,k). This data supports
the conclusion that DDZ and GST are included within the cavity of
γCD in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD).

3DGMnw(GST/γCD = 1:1), (j) 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD = 1:1), and (k)
3DGMw(GST/γCD = 1:1).

2.3 Powder X-ray Diffraction (PXRD)
DSC
measurements suggest that 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD)
contain inclusion complexes. Powder X-ray diffraction was performed
to investigate the crystalline states of 3DGM(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGM(GST/γCD).
Untreated DDZ, ground DDZ, and 3D ground DDZ produced characteristic
diffraction peaks at 2θ of 10.2 and 24.4°. Untreated GST,
ground GST, and 3D ground GST produced characteristic diffraction
peaks at 2θ of 7.3 and 17.8°. γCD yielded a characteristic
diffraction peak at 2θ of 9.1° (Figure 3a–g). PM(DDZ/γCD = 1:1) produced
one diffraction peak corresponding to DDZ at 2θ of 24.4°
and another peak at 2θ of 9.0°, corresponding to γCD
(Figure 3h). PM(GST/γCD
= 1:1) produced a diffraction peak at 2θ of 17.6°, corresponding
to its GST component, and another peak at 2θ of 9.0°, corresponding
to its γCD (Figure 3i). GM(DDZ/γCD = 1:1) produced only the diffraction
peak at 2θ of 24.4°, corresponding to its DDZ. GM(GST/γCD
= 1:1) produced a single diffraction peak at 2θ of 7.6°,
corresponding to its GST (Figure 3j,k). Interestingly, 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD = 1:1) yielded
a new peak at 2θ of 16.4° and lost the characteristic diffraction
peak contributed by DDZ (Figure 3n). 3DGMw(GST/γCD = 1:1) also yielded a new peak
at 2θ of 16.5° and lost the characteristic diffraction
peak contributed by GST (Figure 3o). These results suggested that DDZ/γCD and
GST/γCD formed novel complexes upon cogrinding with a three-dimensional
ball mill. It is generally accepted that inclusion complexes are formed
by mechanochemical effects of grinding.23 GM(DDZ/γCD) and GM(GST/γCD) that were coground using
a rod mill did not produce any new peaks. This method apparently lowered
inclusion efficiency as grinding produced heat. When dry DDZ and GST
were coground with γCD using a three-dimensional ball mill,
DDZ and GST did not form inclusion complexes with γCD since
they were not adequately dispersed and mixed. However, when DDZ and
GST were coground with γCD in distilled water using a three-dimensional
ball mill, inclusion complexes formed, as the distilled water promoted
entry of DDZ and GST into the cavity of γCD.

2.4 Near-Infrared Absorption Spectroscopy (NIR)
The results of DSC and PXRD suggested the possibility that inclusion
complexes are forming in 3DGMw. Therefore, NIR measurements were performed
to investigate the molecular structure of the complexes in the solid
state. DDZ intact produced a peak at 4836 cm–1, corresponding
to the hydroxy group derived from its aromatic ring, and a peak at
4456 cm–1, to corresponding with the alkyl group
(Figure 4A). The peak
produced by the hydroxy group attached to its aromatic ring shifts
to 4824 cm–1, and the peak produced by the alkyl
group shifts to 4396 cm–1 in GM(DDZ/γCD).
The peak produced by the hydroxy group attached to the aromatic ring
of DDZ shifts to 4792 cm–1, and the peak produced
by the alkyl group shifts to 4412 cm–1 in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD).
Unground γCD alone produces a peak at 7024 cm–1, corresponding to its hydroxy group. The peak produced by the hydroxy
group derived from γCD shifts to 7008 cm–1 and broadens in GM(DDZ/γCD). This same peak shifts to 7000
cm–1 and broadens in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD). 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD)
was confirmed to broaden this peak more than GM(DDZ/γCD). Finally,
unground GST alone produced a peak at 4848 cm–1,
corresponding to the hydroxy group attached to its aromatic ring,
and a peak at 4424 cm–1, corresponding to its alkyl
group (Figure 4B).
The peak produced by the hydroxy group on the aromatic ring of GST
shifts to 4844 cm–1, and the peak produced by the
alkyl group shifts to 4400 cm–1 in GM(GST/γCD).
The peak produced by the hydroxy group on the aromatic ring of GST
shifts to 4792 cm–1, and the peak produced by the
alkyl group shifts to 4408 cm–1 in 3DGMw(GST/γCD).
The peak produced by the hydroxy group of γCD shifts to 7012
cm–1 and broadens in 3DGM(GST/γCD) compared
to that of unground γCD alone. This shift and broadening suggest
that 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) have intermolecular
hydrogen bonding in the solid state between groups in the cavity of
γCD and between groups on DDZ and GST.

spectra of GST/γCD systems.

2.5 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
The results of DSC and PXRD for 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD)
suggest the formation of an insertion complex. In addition, PXRD confirmed
that the crystal state changes upon 3D cogrinding. Therefore, SEM
was performed to observe the shape and surface of the crystal formed.
DDZ was smooth and had a columnar shape with a length of around 100
μm (Figure 5A
(a)). GST was smooth and had an acicular shape with a length of around
50 μm (Figure 5B(a)). γCD was angular, smooth, and its particle diameter was
around 20 μm (Figure 5A(b)). In PM(DDZ/γCD) and PM(GST/γCD), we observed
crystals similar to those of pure DDZ, GST, and γCD (Figure 5A(c),B(c)). GM(DDZ/γCD)
and GM(GST/γCD) crystals were 100 μm in diameter, rough,
and looked like aggregates of small fragments (Figure 5A(d),B(d)). 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD)
crystals were 100 μm in diameter, rough, and angular (Figure 5A(e),B(e)). Generally,
inclusions formed by γCD have been described as cubic.24 Our studies confirmed 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and
3DGMw(GST/γCD) crystals to have a cubic shape. It is thought
that DDZ and GST are more likely to form inclusion complexes with
γCD in the solid state.

2.6 Measurement
of 1H–1H Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy
(NOESY) NMR Spectra
1H–1H NOESY
NMR was performed to examine
intermolecular interactions between 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD)
in solution. 1H–1H NOESY NMR was used
to infer the relative position of the inclusion complex since it can
confirm interactions between the guest molecule and the CD cavity.
3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) produced cross peaks between the H-3 proton (3.75
ppm) in the γCD cavity and the H-a proton (7.7 ppm), the H-e,
h proton (7.05 ppm), and the H-d proton (6.3 ppm) of the DDZ (Figure 6A). In 3DGMw(GST/γCD),
cross peaks were confirmed between the H-3 proton (3.74 ppm) in the
γCD cavity and the H-f, g proton (6.7 ppm) and the H-c proton
(6.0 ppm) of the GST (Figure 6B). It is generally known that the H-3 proton is at the wide
edge of the CD ring and the H-6 proton is at the narrow edge of the
CD ring. Thus, this data suggests the formation of two types of inclusion
complexes in which DDZ molecules are enclosed with their phenyl group
or their resorcinol moiety facing the narrower edge of the γCD
ring (Scheme 1A). Similarly,
the data suggests two inclusion types in which GST molecules are enclosed
with their phenyl group or their resorcinol moiety facing the narrow
edge of the γCD ring (Scheme 1B). It has previously been reported that the DDZ/βCD
solid dispersion has two types of inclusion modes.25 These results suggest that DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD
have similar inclusion modes.

2.7 Dissolution Profile (Distilled Water)
The results of
DSC, PXRD, and NIR suggested the possibility that
inclusion complexes formed in the solid state in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD)
and 3DGMw(GST/γCD). Therefore, dissolution tests were performed
to investigate whether dissolution behavior of DDZ and GST changed
due to inclusion complex formation. The concentration of unground
DDZ alone after 5 min was 0.18 μg/mL. The concentration was
0.19 μg/mL for ground DDZ and 1.49 μg/mL for 3D ground
DDZ (Figure 7A). The
concentration of unground GST alone after 5 min was 0.19 μg/mL.
The concentration was 0.43 μg/mL for ground GST and 0.37 μg/mL
for 3D ground GST (Figure 7B). Concentrations of DDZ were 0.17 μg/mL in PM(DDZ/γCD),
5.77 μg/mL in GM(DDZ/γCD), and 6.08 μg/mL in 3DGMnw(DDZ/γCD)
after 5 min. Both ground mixtures with γCD yielded higher dissolution
than DDZ alone. Concentrations of GST were 0.25 μg/mL in PM(GST/γCD),
5.48 μg/mL in GM(GST/γCD), and 3.66 μg/mL in 3DGMnw(GST/γCD)
after 5 min. Concentrations of DDZ and GST in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD)
and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) after 5 min were 6.78 and 8.60 μg/mL.
The solubility was notably improved by 3D grinding compared to that
of unground DDZ or GST alone. The results of the phase solubility
diagrams indicated that the solubility of GST/γCD was higher
than that of DDZ/γCD because the solubility of GST alone was
higher than that of DDZ alone. Improvements in solubilities of DDZ
in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and GST in 3DGMw(GST/γCD) are attributable
to inclusion complex formation. The relatively low solubilities of
GM(DDZ/γCD), GM (GST/γCD), 3DGMnw(DDZ/γCD), and
3DGMnw(GST/γCD) compared to those of 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and
3DGMw(GST/γCD) can be explained by failure to form inclusion
complexes. This conclusion is supported by our observation of the
characteristic diffraction peaks of DDZ and GST alone in the above
mixtures in PXRD. Our results indicate that cogrinding in distilled
water using a three-dimensional ball mill can improve the solubilities
of DDZ and GST.

profiles of GST/γCD systems. Results were expressed as mean
± SD (n = 3).

2.8 Dissolution Profile (Fasted State Simulated
Intestinal Fluid—FaSSIF)
Dissolution tests were performed
to confirm the solubilities of DDZ alone, PM(DDZ/γCD), 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD),
GST intact, PM(GST/γCD), and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) in the intestinal
fluid. The concentration of DDZ alone was 0.48 μg/mL. The concentration
of PM(DDZ/γCD) was 0.36 μg/mL after 5 min (Figure 8). The concentration of GST
alone was 2.24 μg/mL, whereas the concentration of PM(GST/γCD)
was 1.97 μg/mL after 5 min. The concentrations of DDZ and GST
in 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) after 5 min were
8.91 and 11.43 μg/mL. Improved dissolution of 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD)
and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) in the intestinal fluid was confirmed. CoQ10/γCD
inclusion complexes can facilitate CoQ10 incorporation into NaTC when
CoQ10/γCD inclusion complexes are dissolved in NaTC solution.
CoQ10 can be released in solution from CoQ10/γCD inclusion complexes,
and the released CoQ10 forms micelles with NaTC.26 It has been speculated that DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD
inclusion complexes dissolved in FaSSIF solution allow DDZ and GST
to be incorporated into NaTC since NaTC is contained in FaSSIF solution.
Inclusion complexes prepared for DDZ/βCD with coprecipitation
using an organic solvent have been reported.19 We found that the DDZ or GST/βCD inclusion complex was prepared
using a three-dimension ball mill as a new convenient grinding method.
We have already reported that the stability constant of the caffeic
acid/βCD inclusion complex was higher than that of the caffeic
acid/αCD or γCD inclusion complex.15 If it is possible to prepare for DDZ or GST/αCD orβCD
using the three-dimension ball mill method, this would confirm comparing
stability constants and differences of solubility with αCB and
βCD. Since the solubility of the DDZ or GST/γCD complex
is improved under FaSSIF conditions, when an animal experiment was
carried out to improve the bioavailability of DDZ and GST might be
expected.

Figure 8 Dissolution profiles of DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD systems
using FaSSIF. Results were expressed as mean ± SD (n = 3).

In the result of this study, we
made a new inclusion complex of
DDZ or GST/γCD. Thus, we need to study the difference in the
DDZ or GST/CD complex formation between those involving αCD
rings and those involving βCD rings.

2.9 DPPH
Radical Scavenging
Results of
the DPPH radical scavenging test indicated that ascorbic acid inhibited
DPPH radical scavenging, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 4.79 μg/mL; the IC50 value for intact
DDZ was 352.89 μg/mL (Figure 9). In addition, the IC50 value for 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD)
was 265.46 μg/mL, which was significantly lower than the IC50 value for intact DDZ. The IC50 value for 3DGMw
(GST/γCD) was 165.0 μg/mL, which was significantly lower
than the IC50 value for intact GST (201.92 μg/mL).

DPPH radical scavenging test. Results are expressed as mean ±
SD (n = 3). **p < 0.01 vs DDZ
or GST (Tukey’s test).

Electron density increased in the presence of DDZ or GST
molecules
in the γCD molecule. As a result, the DDZ and GST molecules
are more likely to release protons and, subsequently, scavenge DPPH
radicals.21 It is known that the stability
constant of an aqueous solution affects its antioxidant capacity.27 GST/γCD tended to have a higher antioxidant
capacity since the results of the phase solubility study indicated
that GST/γCD had a higher stability constant than DDZ/γCD.

3 Conclusions
In this study, DDZ/γCD
and GST/γCD inclusion complexes
were prepared by cogrinding using a three-dimensional ball mill. Structural
data on 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD) inclusion complexes
confirmed the formation of two types of complexes in which either
the phenyl groups or the resorcinol moieties of DDZ and GST were encapsulated.
Improved solubilities of 3DGMw(DDZ/γCD) and 3DGMw(GST/γCD)
due to inclusion complex formation were confirmed. Improved solubilities
of DDZ/γCD and GST/γCD complexes in FaSSIF indicated that
the impact of inclusion complex formation will be physiologically
relevant in vivo. These results are expected to expand the use of
three-dimensional ball mill grinding beyond its application to mixing
DDZ and GST with γCD. The three-dimensional ball mill will play
a part in a novel composite preparation method in the pharmaceutical
field.

4.2 Preparation of the Physical Mixture (PM),
Ground Mixture (GM), and 3D Ground Mixture (3DGM)
PM(DDZ/γCD)
and PM(GST/γCD) were made by mixing DDZ or GST with γCD
in 1:1 molar ratios using a vortex mixer for 1 min. GM(DDZ/γCD)
and GM(GST/γCD) were made by grinding PM(DDZ/γCD) and
PM(GST/γCD) (1 g of the total of each) for 60 min using a vibration
rod mill (TI-500ET, CMT Co. Ltd., Japan). 3DGM(DDZ/γCD) and
3DGM(GST/γCD) were made by grinding PM(DDZ/γCD) or PM(GST/γCD)
(500 mg total of each) using a three-dimension ball mill with a 200
g ball of Φ5 mm for 60 min plus (3DGMw) or minus (3DGMnw) 500 μL
of distilled water.

4.3 Methods
4.3.1 Phase Solubility Study
Solubility
studies were conducted according to the method of Higuchi and Connors.20 Ten milliliter of distilled water was added
to 20 mg of each of DDZ and GST, yielding supersaturated solutions
of each. Concentrations of γCD ranging from 0 to 30 mM were
added, and suspensions were obtained by shaking at 100 rpm and 25
± 0.5 °C for 24 h using a constant-temperature shaking culture
machine (BR 42 FL, TAITEC Co., Ltd.). Solutions at equilibrium were
filtered through 0.2 μm membrane filters (hydrophilic poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
type, DISMIC), and solution concentrations were quantitated. Apparent
stability constants (Ks) of DDZ/γCD
and GST/γCD inclusion complexes were calculated from slopes
of phase solubility diagrams, and solubilities of DDZ and GST in the
absence of γCD (S0) were determined using eq 1 1  

4.3.2 Quantitation of DDZ and GST by High-Performance
Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
Solubility was quantified by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC: LC-20ADvp, SHIMADZU
CORPORATION) using an Inertsil ODS-3 (4.6 × 150 mm2, Φ5 μm) column and a detection wavelength of 250 nm.
The sample injection volume was 30 μL, and the column temperature
was 40 °C. The mobile phase for DDZ consisted of acetonitrile/distilled
water/acetic acid (25:67.5:7.5). The DDZ retention time was adjusted
to 6 min. The mobile phase for GST consisted of acetonitrile/methanol/distilled
water/acetic acid (30:15:55:0.1), and the GST retention time was adjusted
to 6 min.

4.3.3 Differential Scanning
Calorimetry (DSC)
The thermal behavior of samples was recorded
using a differential
scanning calorimeter (Thermo plus EVO, Rigaku Co, Tokyo). All samples
were weighed (2 mg) and heated and scanned at a rate of 10.0 °C/min
under a nitrogen flow (60 mL/min). Aluminum crimp pans were used for
all samples.

4.3.4 Powder X-ray Diffraction
(PXRD)
A MiniFlex II powder X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku
Corporation, Tokyo)
was used to perform PXRD. The diffraction intensity was measured using
a NaI scintillation counter. PXRD was performed using Cu Kα
radiation (30 kV, 15 mA), a scan rate of 4°/min, and a scan range
of 2θ = 5–40°. Powder samples were held between
glass plates to yield a flat sample plane when measurements were performed.

4.3.5 Near-Infrared (NIR) Absorption Spectroscopy
Fourier transform near-infrared absorption spectroscopy (Buchi
NIR Flex N-500: Nihon Buchi) was used to perform NIR. Measurement
conditions were as follows: wave number was 10 000–4000
cm–1, scan time was 8 s, and scan temperature was
40 °C. Each sample was placed into a sample cup, and measurements
were performed at intervals of 1 nm on the optical path.

4.3.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
An S3000 N scanning
electron microscope (Hitachi High-Technologies
Corporation) was used to perform SEM. Gold was deposited on each sample
for 70 s, and microscopy was performed at an accelerating voltage
of 10 kV.

4.3.7 Measurement of 1H–1H Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY)
NMR Spectra
A 700 MHz NMR system (Agilent Technologies) was
used to perform
NMR. The solvent was D2O. The resonance frequency was 699.6
MHz, pulse width was 45°, relaxation delay was 1.500 s, and temperature
was 25 °C with 256 increments.

4.3.8 Dissolution
Profile
Dissolution
tests were performed using the paddle method of the JP17 revised dissolution
test on an NTR-593 dissolution apparatus (Toyama Sangyo Co. Ltd.,
Japan). Nine hundred milliliter of distilled water (37 ± 0.5
°C) and 300 mL of fasted state simulated intestinal fluid (FaSSIF)
(37 ± 0.5 °C) were stirred at 50 rpm. Ten milligrams of
each of DDZ and GST were accurately weighed and added to the paddle
apparatus. Ten milliliter of each dissolved sample was collected at
5, 10, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min and filtered through 0.2 μm membrane
filters. To keep the total solution volume constant, an equal volume
of solution held at the same temperature was added to the paddle apparatus
after each sample was collected. Quantitation was performed by the
same method as was used in phase solubility studies.

4.3.9 Preparation of Fasted State Simulated Intestinal
Fluid (FaSSIF)
To prepare 500 mL of FaSSIF, 500 mL of the
stock solution was used to dissolve sodium dihydrogen phosphate to
a final concentration of 31.526 mM and sodium chloride to a final
concentration of 116.6 mM. The pH was adjusted to 6.5 with sodium
hydroxide. Sodium taurocholate (NaTC) was dissolved to a final concentration
of 3 mM using 125 mL of stock solution. Biochemistry-grade lecithin
(0.75 mM) was dissolved in 3 mL of dichloromethane in a recovery flask.
The NaTC solution (125 mL) was added to the lecithin solution while
applying ultrasound. The resulting solution was depressurized with
a rotary evaporator (Rotavapor R-215, Nihon Buchi) at 40 °C for
15 min at 100 mbar. Once the white turbid solution became clear, if
the odor of dichloromethane was detected, vacuum was applied for 5
min at 50 mbar. The depressurized solution was put into a 500 mL volumetric
flask. The recovery flask was washed with the remaining 325 mL of
stock solution, which was then added to the volumetric flask. Subsequent
mixtures were prepared in the same 500 mL volumetric flask using a
portion of the solution to wash the other recovery flasks and containers
used to prepare the FaSSIF solution.

4.3.10 DPPH
Radical Scavenging Test
A
DPPH radical scavenging test was performed using a Spectra Max 190
microplate reader (Molecular Devices Japan Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan).
Each sample was dissolved in equal volumes of methanol and phosphate
buffer, pH 6.8 (second fluid in the revised JP17 dissolution test
[second fluid]), and then filtered through 0.2 μm membrane filters.
A DPPH/methanol solution (500 μm) was mixed in a microplate
at a volume ratio of 4:1. The mixture was then incubated at 37 °C
for 50 min while being shielded from light, and the absorbance (As)
of DPPH was measured at a wavelength of 517 nm. A mixture of methanol/second
fluid/DPPH methanol (2:2:1) with a rate of radical removal of 0% (A0) and a mixture of methanol/second fluid (3:2)
with a rate of radical removal of 100% (Blank, Bl) were prepared.
The radical scavenging rate was calculated using eq 2(21) 2  

4.3.11 Statistical Analysis
Data are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). Groups were
compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s
test for multiple comparison. p < 0.01 was considered
statistically significant.
