We report, for the
first time, a multimodal, oxidation-responsive
contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging and photoacoustic imaging
that uses the differences in the properties between Eu in the +2 and
+3 oxidation states. The enhancement of contrast in T1-weighted magnetic resonance and photoacoustic imaging
was observed in the +2 but not in the +3 oxidation state, and the
complex is a known chemical exchange saturation transfer agent for
magnetic resonance imaging in the +3 oxidation state.

Introduction
Perturbation of redox homeostasis has
been correlated with pancreatic,
colorectal, prostate, and lung cancers;1−9 neurodegenerative diseases;10−14 colitis and inflammatory bowel disease;15,16 and liver diseases.17,18 Because changes in redox environments
are associated with many diseases, there is value in detecting these
changes. Multimodal imaging agents that combine magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging are capable of producing images
that provide molecular information,19−42 which is of potential utility in the imaging of oxidative stress.
MRI and photoacoustic imaging have complementary properties: MRI enables
scans over large volumes with practically unlimited depth penetration,
and photoacoustic imaging can produce detailed, real-time images of
areas that are accessible by sources of light.43 Orthogonal imaging techniques that use multimodal imaging
agents are potentially useful with respect to validation and the avoidance
of misinterpretation of data from a single imaging technique. However,
reported multimodal MRI and photoacoustic contrast agents do not report
changes in redox environments. EuII-containing complexes
have been reported as oxidation-responsive contrast agents for MRI
that shorten the T1 relaxation times of
protons on exchanging water,44−49 and we hypothesized that a subset of these complexes that change
absorbance in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum as
a function of oxidation state45,49,50 could serve as oxidation-responsive, multimodal contrast agents
for magnetic resonance imaging and photoacoustic imaging. Here, we
report the photoacoustic properties of Eu-containing species 1 and 2 (Figure 1) that are contrast agents for T1-weighted and chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI, respectively.45,51−65

Absorbance at 410 nm vs concentrations of 1 and 2. The slopes of the lines of best fit are molar absorptivities
(M–1 cm–1).

Eu-containing complexes have different magnetic and absorptive
properties depending on the ligand and the oxidation state of Eu:
EuII shortens T1 relaxation
times, and some complexes of EuII absorb visible light;
EuIII does not measurably shorten T1 relaxation times, and many complexes of EuIII do
not absorb visible light. The influence of the oxidation state of
Eu and ligand structure on T1-weighted
MRI is well-documented,44−49,66−72 and this influence on MRI together with the ability to shift absorbance
into the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum45,49,50 suggested a potential use in
responsive photoacoustic imaging. Photoacoustic imaging relies on
the photoacoustic effect that is initiated by the absorption of visible
light and detected via nonradiative decay in the form of acoustic
waves using an ultrasound detector. As potential responsive contrast
agents for MRI and photoacoustic imaging, we chose to study complexes 1 and 2 because of the visible-light-absorbing
properties of 1 (Figure 1) and the contrast-enhancement properties in MRI documented
with 1 and 2.45,51−65

Results and Discussion
The pair of complexes 1 and 2 has been
previously reported as an oxidation-responsive contrast agent for
MRI.45 Complex 1 has a relaxivity
of 3.73 ± 0.04 mM–1 s–1,
and complex 2 has a relaxivity of zero but acts as a
contrast agent for chemical exchange saturation transfer MRI.45,51−65 This difference in relaxivity is amenable to the visualization of
oxidation from EuII to EuIII. Neither complex
has been characterized with respect to photoacoustic imaging.

To study the optical absorption properties relevant to photoacoustic
imaging, molar absorptivity values were calculated. The molar absorptivity
at 410 nm was calculated because this wavelength is near the wavelength
where the EuII-containing complexes in this study has the
highest absorption on the photoacoustic imaging system used (Figure 1). To determine the
molar absorptivity at 410 nm, UV–visible spectra were measured
before and after oxidation, and molar absorptivity values were calculated
from the spectra. The molar absorptivity of EuII-containing
complex 1 was 3.0 × 102 mM–1 cm–1, and there were no absorptions above the
noise for EuIII-containing species 2 at 410
nm (molar absorptivity of 0 mM–1 cm–1); therefore, the difference in molar absorptivity between the oxidation
states of Eu in complexes 1 and 2 was stark.
Because photoacoustic imaging agents rely on the absorption of visible
light, we expected that complex 1 but not complex 2 would act as a contrast agent for photoacoustic imaging.

To determine whether measurable photoacoustic responses could be
observed that changed with the oxidation state of Eu, we measured
the photoacoustic response (25 °C, 14.5 mJ cm−2 at 410 nm) of 1 and 2 from 410 to 700
nm. Glass tubes with thin walls (0.35 mm) were filled with solutions
of complex 1 under an inert atmosphere, and the same
samples were exposed to air to yield 2. The samples were
placed in a bath of distilled water and irradiated with light, and
the photoacoustic signal amplitude was recorded (Figure 2). The data revealed that complex 1 had a photoacoustic response at 410 nm, which was 4.3×
higher than oxidized complex 2. To verify that the signal
observed was different from the blank (phosphate-buffered saline),
we calculated the minimum detectable concentration of 1. First, the photoacoustic signal amplitude was plotted as a function
of concentration for 1 (Figure 2), and then the photoacoustic intensities
of the lowest point of 2 (30 mM) and the blank were each
measured using seven independently prepared samples. The minimum detectable
concentration was calculated to be 3σ/m,73 where σ is the standard deviation of the
seven repeated measurements at 30 mM and m is the
slope of the best fit line in Figure 2. The minimum detectable concentration for 1 was determined to be 15 mM. To place this value in context, another
discrete molecule has been imaged with photoacoustic imaging in mice
with an injection concentration of 33.3 mM.74 The photoacoustic response data demonstrate that the Eu-containing
species studied show detectable photoacoustic response in the reduced
form (+2 oxidation state of Eu) and do not show photoacoustic response
in the oxidized form (+3 oxidation state of Eu).

amplitude as a function of wavelength for 1 (□), 2 (■), and phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4) (◇); (bottom) photoacoustic intensity vs concentration
of 1.

To visualize the photoacoustic
response before and after oxidation,
samples of 1 and 2 were imaged with photoacoustic
imaging (410 nm, 25 °C, Figure 3). Images of 1 and 2 were
collected at 30, 60, and 100 mM because these were the concentrations
used in calculating the minimum detectable concentration (Figure 2). The photoacoustic
images of 1 appeared bright relative to those of 2, as expected based on the photoacoustic signal amplitudes
in Figure 2. Furthermore, T1-weighted images showed positive contrast enhancement
for complex 1 that contained EuII, and no
visible contrast enhancement for samples of 2 that contained
EuIII (Figure 3), as expected based on reported images for lower concentrations.52−55,57,61,62 EuII-containing complex 1 showed visible photoacoustic responses in addition to contrast
enhancement in T1-weighted MRI. These
imaging properties ceased upon oxidation to EuIII-containing
complex 2, which is an agent for chemical exchange saturation
transfer MRI.45,51−65

and (K) 2 (30 mM in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4).
The samples for MRI and photoacoustic imaging were in tubes with diameters
of 3 and 5 mm, respectively.

In conclusion, we demonstrated, for the first time, an example
of an oxidation-responsive, multimodal contrast agent for MRI and
photoacoustic imaging. Limitations of the proof-of-concept relative
to the reported multimodal, photoacoustic imaging agents, which are
capable of picomolar limits of detection, use near-IR light, or both,19−32 include the relatively high detection limit and use of relatively
high energy visible light in our system. We are currently pursuing
ways to decrease the limit of detection and red-shift the wavelength
of Eu-based systems by forming aggregates of the Eu-containing complexes
in solution and changing the ligand field to shift absorbance of the
EuII-containing species. These findings are a step toward
multimodal sensing of redox environments using photoacoustic imaging.

Experimental
Procedures
Commercially available chemicals were of reagent-grade
purity or
better and were used without further purification unless otherwise
noted. Water was purified using a PURELAB Ultra Mk2 water purification
system (ELGA). Phosphate-buffered saline (10×) was purchased
from Fisher BioReagents. EuIII–DOTA-4AmC [DOTA-4AmC
= 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakis-(acetamidoacetate)]
(2) was purchased from Macrocyclics.

Samples of 1 were prepared in a wet glove box (water
was allowed but not molecular oxygen) under an atmosphere of N2. Complex 1 was prepared following a published
procedure.45 UV–visible spectra
were recorded using an Ocean Optics spectrophotometer (STS-UV-L-25-400-SMA)
coupled to a high-power DH-MINI deuterium tungsten halogen source
(Ocean Optics) or on a Shimadzu UVmini-1240 spectrophotometer. Extinction
coefficients were calculated by plotting absorbance intensity at 410
nm as a function of concentration of 1 or 2. The UV–visible spectra of samples of 1 were
measured under an atmosphere of N2 in a wet glove box or
in airtight cuvettes sealed with paraffin wax inside of the glove
box and then removed from the glove box and measured within an hour
of taking the samples out of the glove box.

Photoacoustic imaging
was performed in the Department of Biomedical
Engineering at Wayne State University with a photoacoustic imaging
system consisting of a programmable ultrasound scanner (Verasonics
Vantage) equipped with a linear array transducer (L114-v), a 30 Hz
pulsed and tunable Nd:YAG pump/OPO laser (Spectra Physics PRO270/Verascan),
and a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) control system. The images
and amplitudes were acquired at 25 °C in a bath of distilled
water. The samples of 1 (100, 60, and 30 mM) and 2 (100, 60, and 30 mM) were in 1× phosphate-buffered
saline (pH 7.4). The solutions were imaged in optical glass tubes
with a wall thickness of 0.35 mm. These tubes showed no observable
signal in the absence of Eu-containing samples (see Figure 3). For samples of 1, the optical glass tubes were plugged with silica glue, waxed, and
imaged within 1 h of preparation.

MRI was performed using a
Bruker ClinScan small animal scanner
(300.43 MHz, 7.06 T) equipped with a 30 cm bore magnet. The samples
of 1 (30 mM) and 2 (30 mM) were in 1×
phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) under an atmosphere of N2, sealed with a cap and then paraffin wax, and measured within an
hour of taking the samples out of the glove box. The T1-weighted images were acquired at ambient temperature
(21 °C) with an echo time of 3.26 ms, a repetition time of 21
ms, flip angles of 5°, 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°,
50°, and 60°, 16 slices at 2 mm thickness, a field of view
of 35 × 70 mm2, and a matrix size of 128 × 256.

Concentrations of Eu were determined using inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) or energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence
(EDXF) spectroscopy. ICP-MS measurements were acquired on an Agilent
Technologies 7700 series ICP-MS instrument in the Lumigen Instrument
Center in the Department of Chemistry at Wayne State University. All
dilutions were performed with 2% aqueous HNO3, which was
also used for blank samples during calibration. The calibration curves
were created using the 153Eu isotope ion count for a 1–200
ppb concentration range (diluted from Fluka ICP standard solution,
100 mg of Eu L–1). EDXF measurements were recorded
using a Shimadzu EDX-7000 spectrometer (Shimadzu Scientific Instruments)
in the Lumigen Instrument Center in the Department of Chemistry at
Wayne State University. The calibration curves were created using
the Eu fluorescence intensity at 5.845 keV for a 25–100 ppm
concentration range (diluted from Fluka ICP standard solution, 100
mg of Eu L–1).
