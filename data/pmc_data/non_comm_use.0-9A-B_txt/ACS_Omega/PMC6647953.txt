β-lactoglobulin (BLG) is a
promiscuous protein in terms of
ligand interactions, having several binding sites reported for hydrophobic
biomolecules such as fatty acids, lipids, and vitamins as well as
detergents. BLG also interacts with neutral and anionic oligo- and
polysaccharides for which the binding sites remain to be identified.
The multivalency offered by these carbohydrate ligands is expected
to facilitate coacervation, an electrostatically driven liquid–liquid
phase separation. Using heteronuclear single quantum coherence NMR
spectroscopy and monitoring chemical shift perturbations, we observed
specific binding sites of modest affinity for alginate oligosaccharides
(AOSs) prepared by alginate lyase degradation. Two different AOS binding
sites (site 1 and site 2) centered around K75 and K101 were identified
for monomeric BLG isoform A (BLGA) at pH 2.65. In contrast, only site
1 around K75 was observed for dimeric BLGA at pH 4.0. The data suggest
a pH-dependent mechanism whereby both the BLGA dimer–monomer
equilibrium and electrostatic interactions are exploited. This variability
allows for control of coacervation and particle formation of BLGA/alginate
mixtures via directed polysaccharide bridging of AOS binding sites
and has implication for molecular network formation. The results are
valuable for design of polyelectrolyte-based BLG particles and coacervates
for carrying nutraceuticals and modulating viscosity in dairy products
by use of alginates.

Introduction
β-Lactoglobulin
(BLG) is an extensively studied lipocalin
found in bovine milk,1,2 which is able to bind a large
variety of hydrophobic ligands.3−6 The common fold of lipocalins is an 8-stranded antiparallel
β-barrel that encloses an internal hydrophobic cavity, the calyx.
The BLG fold includes nine β-strands, of which, strands A–H
form the central calyx and strand I is involved in BLG dimer interface
formation along with an α-helix (Figure 1).7 The tertiary
structure of BLG is further stabilized by two disulfide bonds (C66–C160
and C106–C119), which are buried together with a free cysteine
(C121) in the hydrophobic core.8 BLG exhibits
a variable structural landscape, comprising a homodimer at neutral
pH8,9 and a monomer–dimer equilibrium at pH <
5 and is essentially monomeric at pH < 3.10 Different hydrophobic ligands, e.g., fatty acids and retinoids,5,6 can be accommodated inside the calyx,3 to which access is controlled by the EF-loop that adopts a closed
conformation at pH < 7.5 (Figure 1) and an open conformation at a higher pH.10 Notably, BLG also has binding sites on the outer
surface. Capryllic acid thus interacts with the loop connecting β-strands
C and D (CD-loop, residues W61–C66) at the entrance to the
calyx at pH 7.5,6 while at pH 2, vitamin
D3 binds at a surface-exposed hydrophobic site (D137–R148)
belonging to β-strand I, the α-helix involved at the dimerization
interface, and the loop connecting the two (Figure 1).5

Polysaccharides are widely used
as food additives such as viscosity
agents, pH modulators, water retainers, and antimicrobials11 and constitute important ligands for BLG. Below
the pI (4.7–5.2),12−17 BLG interacts with a wide range of polysaccharides, resulting in
either insoluble particles12,16,18 or liquid coacervates,15,17 depending on the nature
of the polysaccharide and the buffer composition. While particle size,
strength of interaction, and formation of insoluble particles or coacervates
have been attributed to chemical and physico-chemical characteristics
of the polysaccharide,13,18−21 the residues of BLG involved
in the complex formation have so far not been identified. Positively
charged patches on the BLG surface have been proposed to mediate interactions
with anionic polysaccharides13,15,16 through charge neutralization, leading to coacervation or formation
of insoluble particles.11 However, the
large sizes of BLG/polysaccharide complexes have prevented detailed
descriptions of their molecular structures. This knowledge void motivated
the present analysis of a currently developed model system
involving alginate trisaccharides binding to BLG isoform A (BLGA).18 The major aim was to decipher the details of
the molecular interactions.

Alginate is a linear, acidic polysaccharide
composed of α-l-guluronic acid (G) and β-d-mannuronic acid
(M)22 organized as a copolymer with a pattern
of 1,4-linked G-, M-, and M/G-blocks.23−25 Alginate is widely used
as a food additive in dairy products as a modulator of viscosity and
consistency.11 It can also protect whey
proteins from gastric digestion,26 and
BLG/alginate particles have been proposed as nutraceutical carriers.27 We previously described the pH-dependent formation
of BLGA/alginate particles and in that connection also showed that
the model alginate trisaccharides (AOSs), prepared by alginate lyase
degradation, bound to BLGA at pH values 3.0 and 4.0 with Kd values of 1.1 and 0.6 mM, respectively.18 To explain the interaction in more detail to ultimately
enable unraveling of the coacervation mechanisms, the structures of
the AOSs are identified here and their binding sites on BLGA decomposed
using NMR spectroscopy under BLGA monomer- and dimer-forming
conditions at pH values 2.65 and 4.0. Besides mapping of the AOS binding
sites to the BLGA surface, distinct pH-dependent binding site differences
related to the monomer–dimer equilibrium were seen, which may
be relevant for modulating the coacervation behavior of BLGA.

Results
Structure Determination
of AOSs, an Alginate Model
Alginate oligosaccharides were
prepared by degradation using endoacting
alginate lyase, and the di- and trisaccharide end products were separated
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)18 (see Materials and Methods), resulting
in 12 mg of trisaccharides (AOSs) from 100 mg of alginate (Figure S1). Structural analysis by NMR revealed
a mixture of two AOSs with G at the reducing end. The dominant species
(1) (75%) had G as the central residue, whereas the minor
species (2) (25%) had M (Figure 2). As the lyase removes the 4-OH group and
the C-5 proton by β-elimination,28 the C5 epimers β-d-mannuronic acid and α-l-guluronic acid lead to the same nonreducing end product, 4-deoxy-α-l-erythro-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid (Figure 2; Table S1; Figures S2–S7). The structure of these compounds has previously been solved by
NMR, and the assigned chemical shifts are in good correlation with
previous results.29,30

BLGA Has Two Different
Binding Sites for AOSs at Low pH
AOS binding to BLGA was
investigated under different conditions18 than those used for earlier NMR chemical shift
assignments of BLGA.7 Therefore, BLGA was
prepared with the same primary structure as earlier and the first
NMR spectra were recorded under the same conditions as those used
in that study. Subsequently, the chemical shifts were followed under
conditions used to measure binding via chemical shift perturbations
upon addition of AOSs. BLGA has 165 residues including eight prolines
and the additional three residues of the N-terminal (see Materials and Methods, Figure S1). Accordingly, excluding the fast exchanging N-terminal
and the side chain resonances, a total of 156 resonance peaks are
expected. Indeed, the 1H,15N-heteronuclear single
quantum coherence (HSQC) spectrum recorded at pH 2.65 showed 156 dispersed
peaks, of which 145 were unambiguously assigned to BLGA residues (BMRB
27668, Figure S8). Due to overlap/ambiguities
(Y2, K8, N63, C160) and lack of assignment in the reported shift list
(L22, E157, E158, I162),7 nine residues
of BLGA were left unassigned. Importantly, the assigned chemical shifts
were in good agreement with those previously reported for BLGA7 (Figure S9, Tables S2, S3), indicative of correctly folded recombinant BLGA WT.

To map
where the oligosaccharides bind on the monomer, BLGA was titrated
with AOSs at pH 2.65, reaching a molar concentration of 15.5 mM (Figure 3A). Although distinct
chemical shift perturbations were seen, the amplitudes of the shifts
were generally small. Due to weak binding, saturation was not achieved
and fitting to a classical binding model was not possible (Figure S10). Still, chemical shift perturbation
analysis by addition of AOSs (Figure 4) identified affected residues particularly in three
surface-exposed regions, D11–K14 (N-terminal region), K101–Y102
(FG-loop), and E127–D137 (dimerization α-helix) (Figure 1). Single affected
residues outside these regions were also observed, including S30 (AB-loop),
K75 (β-strand D), I84 (FG-loop), and L149 (β-strand I),
as well as perturbation of three unassigned peaks (Figure 4, Table 1). Although most of the regions and residues
directly contain or have neighboring positively charged residues,
mainly lysine, there were several lysines on the BLGA surface that
remained unperturbed, e.g., K39, K47, K48, K60, K69, and K70.

Based on
these observations, two binding sites, site 1 and site
2, were defined, which, together with the anionic character of AOSs,
motivated the production of BLGA single variants, K8A, K75A, and K101A,
to investigate the effect on binding by removing a specific positive
charge. K8A was chosen based on its location spatially close to K14
and K75 and because it was unassigned in our work due to overlap.
K8 was thus hypothesized to be one of the three unassigned spin systems
undergoing chemical shift perturbations by addition of AOSs. In the 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum of BLGA K8A, some peak overlap
was observed, but it still allowed for K8 assignment (Figure 5A). Notably, after successful
assignment, it was clear that K8 was unperturbed at pH 2.65 by addition
of AOSs (Figure 4).

with 1H,15N-HSQC spectra of BLGA mutants (in
red): (A) K8A, (B) K75A, and (C) K101A at pH 2.65.

The conformational integrity of unlabeled recombinant
BLGA WT and
mutant proteins was assessed by far-UV circular dichroism (CD). As
expected for the β-sheet-rich BLGA,31 a global minimum at 216–218 nm was observed and only very
small differences from WT were seen for K8A and K75A (Figure S11). By contrast, the fold of the K101A
variant was clearly compromised as deduced from the shifted CD minimum
(Figure S11) in agreement with extensive
peak collapse in the 1H,15N-HSQC spectrum, indicative
of a partially unfolded structure (Figure 5C). AOS binding analysis was therefore not
pursued for BLGA K101A. At pH 2.65, AOSs elicited a similar chemical
shift perturbation for K8A, K75A, and WT BLGA (Table 1). Thus, not one single residue appeared
to be solely responsible for the binding of AOSs to BLGA.

Two
AOS binding sites were identified on the surface of monomeric
BLGA at pH 2.65, site 1 and site 2 (Figure 4, see also Figure 7). Except for S30 (AB-loop) and L149 (β-strand
I) (Table 1, Figure 4), most of the involved
residues of BLGA are situated outside the dimerization interface,
i.e., the AB-loop (S27–V41) and β-strand I (I147–F150).32 Subsequently, the influence of pH on AOS binding
was investigated at pH 4.0 where BLGA is mostly in the dimeric form.10

pH Tunes Alginate Binding to BLGA and Controls
Coacervation
The effect of BLGA dimerization on the binding
of AOSs in a dairy-relevant
pH range was investigated by chemical shift perturbation at pH 4.0.33 First, BLGA resonances were assigned at pH 4.0
by titration from pH 2.65 to 3.2 and 4.0 (Figure 3C; Figure S12, Tables S2, S4). Here, at pH 4.0, we obtained unambiguous assignments
of 132 residues, compared to 145 residues at pH 2.65. As expected,
this increase in pH caused BLGA to dimerize, which seriously affected
line widths for several peaks, resulting in assignments of only 132
residues (Table S4, BMRB no: 27668). Mapping
these missing assignments onto the BLGA structure clearly showed that
residues with broadened peaks located distinctly to the known dimerization
interface (Figure 7C). Next, AOSs were added by titration and chemical shift perturbations
were analyzed (Figures 6 and 3B). Compared to the BLGA monomer, distinct
differences were observed. Notably, Y102 in site 2 was no longer affected
by AOS binding, and K101 was less affected at pH 4.0 than at pH 2.65
(Figure 6). By contrast,
K75 in site 1 retained a significant chemical shift perturbation at
pH 4.0. Moreover, residues belonging to the α-helix contributing
to the dimerization interface were unperturbed by AOS binding, whereas
the signal for D129 was lost (Tables 1 and S4). A few peaks, including
those of the surface-exposed K8 and K83 (Table 1), which were unaffected at pH 2.65, were
changed by AOS binding at pH 4.0. Notably, also the buried A80 was
affected by binding, which may be due to changes in K8, which is located
in the flexible, disordered N-terminal region,7,8 shielding
A80. At pH 4.0, K8 was clearly involved in AOS binding. Taken together,
these comparative data highlight that AOS exploits the surface of
BLGA in a pH-dependent manner and that the monomer and the dimer of
BLGA bind differently to AOSs.

shifts.

Mapping AOS-induced chemical shift
perturbations at pH values 2.65
and 4.0 to the surface of BLGA identified two areas at pH 2.65 (Figure 7), site 1 constituted by D11, E12, K14, and K75 (BLGA N-terminal
region and DE-loop) and site 2 constituted by K101, Y102, E126, D128,
and D129 (FG-loop and H-dimerization α-helix loop). Notably,
at pH 4.0, residues of site 2 surrounding K101 appeared unaffected
by addition of AOSs and the shift for K101 was of much smaller amplitude
than at pH 2.65. A change in pH to 4.0 is assumed to affect the protonation
state of the acidic side chains. Using PROpKa,34 the pH change is suggested to partially deprotonate E126,
D128, and D129. The pKa values calculated
for these residues in the monomeric
(PDB 1DV9) BLGA
were D128, 2.52; D129, 4.79; and E126, 4.80 and for dimeric (PDB: 1BEB) BLGA, D128, 3.69;
D129, 4.11; and E126, 4.18. Considering the prediction accuracy of
PROpKa, we note that these values are similar to those of the free
amino acids (Glu, pKa 4.07 and Asp, pKa 3.90). Overall, it is reasonable to assume
partial deprotonation at pH 4.0. This alters the electrostatic surface
of site 2, rendering it binding-incompetent due to charge–charge
repulsion between BLGA and the anionic AOSs. Moreover, E126, D128,
and D129 are located close to the dimerization interface. At pH 4.0,
site 1 surrounding K75 also changes, as K14 no longer contributes,
while K8, A80, K83, F82, and D53 appear affected.

pH titration (pH 2.65 to 3.2 to 4.0) are in red and also mapped to

Turbidity measurements on BLGA and alginate have been shown
to
gauge coacervate formation.18,20 Since the change in
AOS-induced chemical shift perturbations for both K8A and K75A was
indistinguishable from WT (Table 1), turbidimetry was performed on BLGA WT, K8A, and
K75A at varying alginate concentrations to confirm that the mutations
have little effect on the ALG/BLGA interaction. K8A and K75A BLGA
gave marginally less protein remaining in solution than WT, albeit
BLGA WT at the higher alginate concentrations displayed increased
turbidity compared to the two variants (Figure 8). The reason for this may be lower affinity
of BLGA variants for alginate, resulting in smaller and/or fewer particles
than with WT. The mutant proteins may also have lower solubility due
to lower surface charge.

Discussion
BLG is known to exploit
different binding sites for a wide range
of molecules spanning from hydrophobic ligands accommodated inside
the calyx3 to vitamins binding on the surface.5 The presently identified AOS binding sites are
distinct from previously reported binding areas on the surface of
BLGA and the first accommodating carbohydrates.5,6 Notably,
a subset of the lysines is consistently involved in AOS binding (K14,
K75, K83, K101 at pH 2.65 and K8, K75, K101 at pH 4.0). However, many
of the 15 surface-exposed lysines7 appear
unaffected by the presence of AOSs. This highlights that the probed
interactions are specific and not a mere electrostatic effect, which
is also supported by the mutational removal of a single cationic side
chain having little effect on binding, suggesting that other types
and not just electrostatic forces are involved in the interaction.
Some of the unaffected lysines may engage in local surface electrostatics
of their immediate environment, in this way preventing interaction
with AOSs. BLG has previously been shown to undergo a conformational
change to a more α-helical structure induced by anionic lipids
at pH values 4.6 and 2.6.35 However, addition
of AOSs did not elicit large changes in the NMR spectra, indicative
of helix formation (Figure 3). Kd values of AOS binding to
BLGA were determined previously by isothermal titration calorimetry
(ITC) to 1.1 and 0.6 mM at pH 3.0 and 4.0, respectively.18 However, none of the present chemical shift
perturbations reached saturation to allow for determination of Kd (Figure S10). Presumably,
this is due to the 5-fold higher ionic strength used in the NMR compared
to the ITC experiments, weakening the electrostatic interactions between
AOSs and BLGA.16,18,36

Binding of aroma compounds onto the
surface of BLG at pH 2.0 was described by NMR,37 identifying two hydrophobic binding sites, one for γ-decalactone
involving K47, L57, K70, and I72 and one for β-ionone involving
K60, Y102, L104, and E129.37 Both sites
are located in the hydrophobic region between β-strand G, the
dimerization α-helix, and β-strand I. The positions of
these binding sites are distinctly different from those determined
for the AOSs, although Y102 is shared. Notably, BLGA is reported to
catalyze lipofuscin formation using K60 and K69 as well as K77 and
K91 as catalytic residues.38 Also, none
of these residues were found to interact with the AOSs, even though
side chain assignments are needed to fully confirm this conclusion.

Charged patches on BLG were previously suggested to engage in interaction
with anionic polysaccharides,13,15,16,18,20 and binding regions for anionic polysaccharides were hypothesized
to include residues A1–K14, V41–K60, T76–K83,
and A132–R148.15,16 Notably, at pH 4.0, the AOS-perturbed
residues in BLGA are K8, G9, D11, D53, K75, A80, F82, K83, and D85,
whereas no residues from the stretch V41–K60 underwent noteworthy
chemical shift perturbation, except the surface-exposed D53 and the
buried V41 and L57 (Figure 6). At pH 2.65, two AOS binding areas are identified on BLGA,
of which site 1 remains as the sole, albeit rearranged, binding site
at pH 4.0. However, the AOSs do bind near residues from the segments
A1–K14 and K75–D85 at both pH 4.0 and 2.65, suggesting
these regions to be the main sites. In addition, at pH 2.65, significant
chemical shift perturbation occurred in the region A132–R148
as well as around K101–Y102 in site 2, but these disappeared
at pH 4.0 (Figure 6). The observation of two binding sites at pH 2.65 is in agreement
with previous ITC stoichiometry of two BLGA AOS binding sites at pH
3.0 and one at pH 4.0.18

The charged
state of AOS is very important for a valid extrapolation
of the AOS binding sites to alginate/BLGA interaction and subsequent
coacervation. The pKa values of M and
G monosaccharides are 3.38 and 3.65, respectively.39 Thus, there is a possibility that AOS could be neutral
at pH 2.65. The individual pKa values
of the acid groups in the sugar units and the charged state of the
molecule were predicted using Chemicalize. At pH 2.65, it is predicted
that 64.21% of the population is charged (25.2% −2, 39.01%
−1), and at pH 4, 100% of the molecules are charged (77.55%
−3, 21.11% −2, 1.34% −1). Thus, the AOS should
be charged under all conditions used in this study and the results
thus enable extrapolation to alginate binding. site 1 is also affected
at both pH 2.65 and 4, indicative of ionic contribution in the interaction
at both pHs. The presence of the double bond at the nonreducing end
of the trisaccharides is a consequence of the enzymatic degradation
as no alginate hydrolase has been discovered to date.40 It will cause a change in the sugar ring that goes from
being in a chair conformation to a boat conformation. This combined
with short trisaccharides will have significant border effects that
are not found with the polysaccharide. The AOS, however, is the only
alginate oligosaccharide published to date that does not form insoluble
particles with BLGA, while the interaction with BLGA remains.18 This is why AOS was chosen as a model system
for NMR studies. Enzymatic degradation affords a greater control over
the polymerization as opposed to partial acid hydrolysis and was chosen
for this reason.

AOSs are a mixture of two anionic trisaccharides
(Figure 2), which are
expected to interact
with positively charged residues such as lysines as found for other
anionic oligosaccharide protein complexes.41 In BLGA also, hydrophobic residues undergo chemical shift perturbations
including Y102 at pH 2.65 and L10, A80, and F82 at pH 4.0. This is
also supported by the little difference observed by mutating K8 and
K75 in the interaction sites (Table 1 and Figure 8). This suggests that other types of interactions
are involved in AOS binding to BLGA, thus going beyond what is classically
seen for oppositely charged flexible polymers.42 This could be a consequence of BLGA having a well-defined
tertiary structure at pH values 2.65 and 4.010,43 and therefore charged or hydrophobic residues cannot move freely
relative to the binding area upon interaction with AOSs.

Figure 8 Turbidity (600
nm) of BLGA WT and variants mixed with alginate
at pH 4.0 and absorbance (280 nm) of supernatants after centrifugation
(see Materials and Methods): BLGA WT (circle),
K75A (square), and K8A (triangle).

The mutational analysis of alginate/BLGA binding/coacervation
did
not reveal big differences between the mutant proteins and WT (Figure 8). However, the observed
differences in the alginate concentration required to reach a saturation
could indicate a change in binding stoichiometry; something that will
be needed to be addressed in later studies.

Overall, these results
identify binding sites on BLGA for anionic
oligosaccharides and hence also polysaccharides, which are dependent
on the pH and thus on the oligomeric state of BLGA. Through binding
of longer polysaccharides, this forms the basis for coacervate formation.
Thus, the pH dependence is one way to regulate the behavior of the
coacervates, opening up for the design of polysaccharides aimed toward
specific coacervate properties using BLGA. Modulating charge density
and hydrophobicity of the carbohydrate ligands to target the binding
sites can enable selection for specific higher-order assemblies.

Conclusions
Two surface-exposed AOS binding sites on monomeric BLGA centered
around K75 (site 1) and K101 (site 2) were identified. The sites are
distinctly different from previously reported binding sites on BLG
for other compounds. Notably, in the dimeric BLGA, only site 1 is
functional at pH 4.0. Although the AOSs/BLGA interaction is electrostatically
driven, the binding sites are specific and not structurally dynamic,
suggesting that other types of important interactions occur, e.g.,
stacking interactions between monosaccharide rings and aromatic side
chains. A further scrutiny of these interactions by mutations can
help elucidate their importance including their influence on macromolecular
particle formation. Overall, the distinct BLGA binding sites and their
pH dependence are fundamental characteristics that can help guide
design of polyelectrolyte carbohydrates to achieve desirable coacervate
behavior.

Materials and Methods
Preparation of Alginate Oligosaccharides
(AOSs)
AOSs
were prepared essentially as described.18 Briefly, 10 mg mL–1 alginate (M̅n = 40 kDa = M/G ratio = 0.6, and polydispersity = 2.6;
kind gift of Finn Madsen, DuPont Nutrition Biosciences, Brabrand,
Denmark) was incubated with endoacting alginate lyase from Sphingomonas sp. (Megazymes, Ireland) at 42 °C for
6.5 h, followed by enzyme inactivation (90 °C, 10 min), centrifugation
(20 000g, 10 min), and desalting of the supernatant
into water (Hiprep Desalt 26/10; GE Healthcare). Oligosaccharide products
were monitored spectrophotometrically at 235 nm.18 The fractions containing AOSs were added acetonitrile to
50% (v/v) and purified by HPLC (TSKgel Amide-80 column 5 μm
particle size; 4.6 by 250 mm with 4.6 × 10 mm guard column (Tosoh,
Japan); Ultimate 3000 HPLC (Dionex, CA) equipped with RI-101 refractive
index detector (Showa Denko, Japan)) eluted by 70% (v/v) acetonitrile
in water as mobile phase at 70 °C at a flow rate of 1 mL min−1. AOSs were quantified using the phenol sulfuric acid
method.18,44 Purity was assessed by thin layer chromatography
(TLC; silica gel 60 F254; Merck) 2 × 3 μL spotted
effluent, developed twice in 50% butanol/25% acetic acid/25% MilliQ
water and visualized by taring (300 °C) in 10% sulfuric acid,
80% ethanol, 8% H2O, and 2% orcinol (Supporting Information, Figure S1).

pKa values of the acid groups in AOSs were predicted by
submitting the structure to chemicalize.com (ChemAxon, 06/02-2019).

BLGA Cloning, Mutagenesis, and Pichia pastoris Transformation
The vector pPICZαA harboring the gene
encoding BLGA (UniProt: P02754) was optimized for P.
pastoris to produce a recombinant BLGA variant with
the N-terminal extension EAE (here numbered −1 to −3)
and three point mutations, changing L1I2 to
A1,Y2 and the V105F (Figure S1). These changes were done to enable transfer of assignments
reported previously for structure determination of BLGA by NMR.7 The full primary structure of this BLGA variant
is given in the Supporting Information.
The DNA sequence encoding the BLGA V105F (referred to as BLGA) was
cloned in-frame with the Saccharomyces cerevisiae α-mating factor to give pPICZαA–BLGA (purchased
from GeneArt; Thermofisher). An Xhoi restriction site was introduced
after the α-factor gene to avoid additional amino acids to remain
after cleaving off the α-factor. Single BLGA mutants K8A, K75A,
and K101A were made by site-directed mutagenesis (Quick Change lightning
mutagenesis kit; Agilent) using the primers (purchased from Eurofins
Genomic; Germany) K8A 5′cgtcacccagaccatgcagggtttggatatcca3′;
K8A_anti 5′tggatatccaaaccctgcatggtctgggtgacg3′; K75A

5′ggttttggacaccgactacaaagcgtacttgttgttctgcatg3′, and
K101A_anti 5′catgcagaacaacaagtacgctttgtagtcggtgtccaaaacc3′.
Wild-type (WT) and mutant plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli DH5α by heat shock and selected
for zeocin resistance (Novagen, U.K.), and the mutations were confirmed
by sequencing (GATC Biotech, Germany). pPICZαA–BLGA WT
and mutant plasmids were linearized using PmeI and
transfected into P. pastorisX-33 by electroporation (EasySelect Pichia Expression Kit;
Invitrogen). Transformants were selected on zeocin containing yeast
extract peptone dextrose (YDP) agar plates incubated 3 days at 30
°C.

Production of Isotope-Labeled Recombinant BLGA
Eight
clones from each P. pastoris transformation
were restreaked on YDP agar zeocin plates and selected for expression
level in 50 mL of buffered minimal methanol medium (BMM: 0.1 M K2HPO3/KH2PO3 (KPi) pH 6.0,
0.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without amino acids and ammonium chloride,
4 × 10–5% (w/v) biotin, 1% ammonium sulfate,
0.5% (v/v) glycerol), growing for 5 days at 22 °C evaluated on
aliquots removed with 24 h intervals and analyzed by sodium dodecyl
sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The transformants
secreting the highest amount of protein were propagated in 25 mL of
buffered glycerol-complex medium (BMGY: 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2%
(w/v) peptone, 0.1 M KPI pH 6.0, 1.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base,
4 × 10–5% (w/v) biotin, 1% (v/v) glycerol)
(30 °C, 150 rpm) until OD600 = 2–6, inoculated
into 1 L BMGY medium in baffled 3 L shake flasks, and grown until
OD600 = 2–6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
(1500g, 5 min, 22 °C), resuspended in 1 L of
BMM medium, incubated 110 h (22 °C, 150 rpm), and methanol being
added to 0.5% (v/v) every 24 h. Cells were pelleted (10 000g, 30 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was filtered
(0.45 μm) and concentrated by cross-flow filtration (SARTOFLOW
Slice 200 Benchtop System, 5 kDa Hydrostart ultrafiltration cassette
at 4 °C; Sartorius, Germany). Protein concentration was determined
spectrophotometrically using a predicted molar extinction coefficient
of 18 700 M–1 cm–1 (Protparam).45 Conformational integrity of BLGA variants was
confirmed by circular dichroism spectroscopy. For NMR analysis 15N-labeled BLGA was produced essentially as described above
in 2 L of BMM (0.1 M KPi pH 6.0, 0.34% (w/v) yeast nitrogen base without
amino acids and ammonium chloride, 4 × 10–5% (w/v) biotin, 1% 15N-ammonium sulfate
(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., Andover), 0.5% (v/v) glycerol).

Purification of Recombinant BLGA WT and Mutants
All
steps were performed at 4 °C. Concentrated culture supernatant
was buffer-exchanged to 50 mM KPi pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl (Hiprep Desalt
column 26/10; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 2 mL min–1 and concentrated (3 kDa cutoff, Amicon Ultra 15 centrifugal filter;
Merck). Recombinant BLGA WT and mutant proteins were purified by size
exclusion chromatography (Hiload Superdex 75 26/60; GE Healthcare)
at a flow rate of 1.4 mL min–1 in 50 mM KPi pH 6.0
and 150 mM NaCl and dialyzed (MilliQ water, 3 kDa cutoff Spectra/Por
membrane; Spectrumlabs) by 3 × 100-fold dilution, each for 4
h, evaluated by SDS-PAGE to be >95% pure (data not shown), lyophilized,
and stored at −20 °C until use. For NMR experiments, proteins
were dissolved in 55 mM KPi pH 2.65, 3.2, or 4.0 and dialyzed against
the buffer (as above). Yields of purified BLGA WT, K8A, K75A, and
K101A were 40.4, 20.6, 35.2, and 6.3 mg, respectively, per liter of
culture containing 15N-ammonium sulfate.

Circular Dichroism
Spectroscopy
Lyophilized BLGA WT
and mutant proteins were dissolved in 10 mM NaPi pH 7.0, centrifuged
(20 000g, 20 min, 4 °C), and dialyzed
(3 kDa cutoff, Spectra/Por membrane; Spectrumlabs) 3 × 100-fold
dilution, each against the buffer for >4 h, at 4 °C. Far-UV
CD
spectra were recorded at 250–190 nm in a 1 mm quartz cuvette
(50 nm min–1, 1 nm bandwidth, 2 s response time,
25 °C; Jasco J810 Spectropolarimeter, Peltier controlled). Ten
scans were averaged, and a buffer background recorded using identical
parameters was subtracted. The molar ellipticity was calculated by  where m is the molar protein
concentration, θ is the ellipticity at wavelength λ, and d is the path length in centimeter.31

NMR of BLGA WT and Mutant Proteins
15N-BLGA
WT and mutant proteins were diluted to 50 mM KPi H2O/D2O (9/1 v/v) and 0.1 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentanesulfonic
acid (DSS) and centrifuged (12 000g, 20 min,
4 °C) prior to analysis by NMR spectroscopy in 5 mm Shigemi microtubes.
The buffer was chosen to match the conditions used by Uhrínová
et al.7 and to ensure consistent pH values
outside the main buffering range of the buffer. Upon addition of ligand,
pH was corrected in all samples prior to the measurement and measured
immediately after, to secure consistency. BLGA WT is monomeric10 and stable for many days at pH 2.65,7 while a significant amount of dimer is present
at pH values 3.2 and 4.0.10 The 1H, 15N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra
were recorded on an 800 MHz Varian INOVA spectrometer equipped with
a 5 mm triple resonance room temperature probe with a Z-field gradient
at 37 °C46 using a Varian/Agilent
BioPack sequence or on a 600 MHz Bruker AVANCE system equipped with
a cryoprobe. Recorded free induction decays were processed with nmrPipe.47 Proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal
DSS at 0.00 ppm and indirectly using gyromagnetic ratios for 15N and 13C chemical shifts.

NMR Assignment and Chemical
Shift Perturbation Analysis
Assignments of N and HN nuclei of BLGA at pH 2.65 were
done using the assignment list of BLGA obtained from triple resonance
spectra recorded at exactly the same conditions as those for template.7 To transfer the assignments to pH 4.0, 1H,15N-HSQC NMR spectra of 400 μM BLGA WT were recorded
at pH values of 2.65, 3.2, and 4.0, and the signals were followed
during the titration to allow assignments at pH 4.0. These assignments
are deposited in the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB, http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/)
entry 27668. For mapping of binding sites, a series of 1H, 15N-HSQC spectra were recorded for 100 μM BLGA
WT or mutant protein and 15.5 mM AOSs at pH 2.65 or pH 4.0 prior to
mixing in five steps with a BLGA sample not containing AOSs to give
seven spectra in total recorded per protein sample at 0, 2.6, 5.2,
7.8, 10.4, 12.9, and 15.5 mM AOSs. Chemical shifts were in fast exchange
and could be followed during the titration. Chemical shift perturbations
were calculated to map the binding site on the surface of the protein
by  where
ΔδH = ΔδHfree – ΔδHobs and ΔδN = ΔδNfree – ΔδNobs are changes in the proton and nitrogen chemical shifts
(in ppm).48 Significant chemical shift
perturbation was defined as the average chemical shift perturbation
plus one standard deviation.

Turbidimetry
The formation and assessment
of solubility
of BLGA/alginate particles were done as previously described.18 Briefly, alginate, BLGA WT, or mutant proteins
were dissolved in 50 mM NaPi pH 4.0. BLGA (1 mg mL–1 or 54 μM) was mixed with alginate (0–0.2 mg mL–1 or 0–5 μM using M̅n = 40 kDa), incubated for 10 min at room temperature,
and the turbidity was measured at 600 nm. Subsequently, the mixtures
were centrifuged (20 000g, 20 min, 20 °C)
and remaining soluble protein was determined spectrophotometrically
at 280 nm.
