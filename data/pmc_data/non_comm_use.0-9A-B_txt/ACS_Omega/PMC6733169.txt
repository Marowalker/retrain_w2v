Characterizing materials
is preferably done by multiple wavelengths.
In opaque materials, the scattering poses a challenge due to the additional
complexity to the spectroscopic measurements. We have previously demonstrated
an iterative multiplane method for characterizing materials using
the reflection from turbid media. Initial studies were performed in
the red wavelength regime (632.8 nm) which is optimal for biomedical
applications. However, in order to differentiate between materials,
it is better to use multiple wavelengths, as spectroscopy may detect
the material fingerprint. In this paper, our iterative multiplane
optical property extraction (IMOPE) technique is presented in the
blue regime (473 nm). Agar-based solid phantom measurements were conducted
and compared to our theoretical model. Compatibility between experiments
in the red and blue wavelengths shows the robustness of our technique.

Introduction
Light–matter
interactions have been studied for hundreds
of years in different research areas, for example, material analysis,
quantum physics, and biomedical optics. The interaction of light with
different materials depends on the material optical properties, with
the refractive index being a main factor. Spectroscopic methods examine
the spectral dependence of the interaction, which reveals the material
fingerprint. A very established spectroscopic technique is Raman spectroscopy
(RS),1,2 which is based on the medium inelastic scattering.
It is an important tool for determining structural information of
solid and liquid media and chemical bonding changes. RS as a nondestructive
technique has been applied in analytical chemistry,3 skin studies,4,5 food analysis,6 and detection of exogenous substances in latent
fingerprints7 where it is important not
to harm the samples. Another technique is the near-infrared spectroscopy
(NIRS) that uses the NIR radiation (780–2500 nm) and the light
attenuation by the sample to understand its chemical constitution
and physical parameters.8,9 The use of the NIR region
allows a greater penetration depth for biomedical applications, meaning
it is useful for probing bulk materials; however, the tradeoff is
the technique sensitivity.8 Hyperspectral
imaging (HSI)10 in comparison to RS and
NIRS obtains not only the sample spectral information but also the
spatial information with high sensitivity to minor elements. The combination
of conventional imaging and spectroscopic measurements makes HSI very
appealing for various fields such as remote sensing,10,11 astronomy,12 agriculture,13 pharmaceuticals,14 and medical applications.15 Numerous
spectroscopic techniques are applied in different research fields
with each having its advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, they
are all able to detect the sample atomic, molecular, or macro information
by the use of spectral measurements.

We have previously presented
our iterative multiplane optical property
extraction (IMOPE) technique16−21 for extracting the scattering properties of different tissues. The
fundamental idea of the IMOPE is the connection between the scattering
properties of an irradiated medium and the re-emitted light phase.
The irradiation of the medium is done by a laser source chosen to
be in the red regime (λ = 632.8 nm). Our IMOPE technique was
initially aimed for biomedical applications where the red wavelengths
are the desired radiation source due to higher penetration depths.
However, as in spectroscopy, multiple wavelengths, rather than just
one, can provide more accurate information about the components within
the sample. Each component has a different optical signature according
to its optical properties, which determines the preferable radiation
spectral region. For example, detecting different materials within
an opaque aqueous environment, e.g., seawater, is better done using
the blue regime. As the absorption of seawater is lower in the blue
regime than in the red, the penetration depth of the blue light is
higher, which enables detection of components deeper in the seawater.

In this research, the use of the IMOPE technique in the blue regime
is presented. The IMOPE technique reconstructs the re-emitted light
phase from an irradiated medium using the iterative Gerchberg–Saxton
(GS) algorithm,22 which is known for beam
shaping23 and phase retrieval24 for image reconstruction.25 The GS algorithm uses the propagation equations of the
electromagnetic field and known intensity images at identified locations
in order to reconstruct the light phase. Note, in contrary to the
GS algorithm that uses the phase itself, the IMOPE rather examines
the phase distribution, specifically its second moment, the root mean
square (RMS). Following the computation of the reconstructed phase
RMS, its value is compared to our theoretical model for extracting
the scattering properties of the sample. The IMOPE technique at the
red regime was applied first in transmission mode for detecting organic
nanoparticles within tissues16 and the
quantitative signature of milk components (lactose and milk protein).17 Followed by this, reflection-based IMOPE was
constructed and applied for tissues viability test and detection of
gold nanorods and blood flow in the femoral vein of a mouse.18

In this paper, we examine the feasibility
of extracting the scattering
properties by the IMOPE technique in the blue regime. The IMOPE experimental
setup was duplicated, and a blue laser, rather than a red one, was
used as a light source. In addition, the scattering properties of
solid tissue-like phantoms had to be extrapolated and computed for
the blue regime as the literature only provides liquid phantom scattering
properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that
solid phantom scattering properties are calculated in the blue regime.
Finally, the blue regime reflection-based IMOPE was tested on solid
tissue-like phantoms and produced high compatibility to theory and
results of the red regime reflection-based IMOPE.

Materials and Methods
Iterative Multiplane
Optical Property Extraction (IMOPE)
The IMOPE technique is
a combination of a theoretical model, an experimental
setup, and the iterative GS algorithm22 (as shown in Figure 1a). The theoretical model links the re-emitted light phase distribution
to the reduced scattering coefficient (μs′)
of a medium. The experimental setup records the light intensity images
at different distances, which are then processed by the iterative
GS algorithm to reconstruct the reflected light phase. Finally, the
reconstructed light phase RMS is computed and compared to the theoretical
phase RMS to receive the medium μs′.

Figure 1 Reflection-based
IMOPE. (a) Schematic description of the IMOPE
algorithm for extracting μs′. After running
the multiplane GS algorithm as described elsewhere,21 the estimated phase φ̂j is retrieved. The RMS is computed and compared to the theory to
produce the estimated μs′. (b) Experimental
setup in the blue regime for recording light intensity images. The
camera records images at multiple planes with equal intervals between
them (dz). The light source is a DPSS laser with
a wavelength of λ = 473 nm, and the focal length of the lens
is 75 mm; polarizers were added for optical clearing purposes. The
solid phantoms were set on a three-axis micrometer plates and can
be adjusted in the x–y–z directions.

The IMOPE theoretical
model was described previously in the red
regime20,21 where a master–slave dual-source
model26 is taken into account. In this
configuration, the physical source is represented by two virtual sources,
a primary and secondary isotropic source, which their locations depend
on the optical properties of the irradiated sample (as described in
detail elsewhere20,26). The dual-model theory describes
the reflected intensity only; hence, we have proposed to define the
phase as the product of the wavenumber and average pathlength,19−21 which depends on the differential pathlength factor (DPF).27,28 Translating the DPF to a phase accumulation, we received 1  where n is
the medium refractive index, λ is the light source wavelength,
and ρ is the distance between the source and the detector.

As can be seen in Figure 1a, the IMOPE technique starts with reconstructing the re-emitted
light phase using the multiple-measurement GS algorithm with recorded
light intensity images. The GS algorithm reconstructs the phase based
on the electromagnetic field free space propagation (FSP) equations.
In general, the algorithm uses M intensity images
at known distances and the propagation between them to reconstruct
the reflected light phase that was lost once the image was captured.
The propagation back and forth repeats until it reaches a threshold
condition (the detailed protocol is described elsewhere21). Following the reconstruction of the phase
image, we compute its distribution and specifically its RMS by the
following equation 2  where AM(x, y) is the amplitude
(the square root of the intensity) at the desired Mth plane along z, γ is the spatial region
of interest, φ̂M(x, y) is the reconstructed phase accumulated at the
desired plane following a propagation distance of D, and φM(x, y) is the average phase.

At the last step of the IMOPE
algorithm, the experimental phase
RMS is compared to the theoretical model for extracting the reduced
scattering coefficient of the medium.

Experimental Setup
A noninvasive reflection-based experimental
setup was constructed for recording light intensity images at different z locations, separated by a distance dz. The recorded images were then utilized by the multiple-measurement
GS algorithm in order to reconstruct the reflected light phase. The
experimental setup is composed of a laser source, polarizers (LPVISE100-A,
Thorlabs, Japan) for optical clearing purposes (where the first polarizer
positioned where the maximum intensity is received and the second
polarizer is positioned 90° to it in order to clear the surface
reflection),29 a lens (focal length of f = 75 mm) in order to focus the light beam, and a CMOS
camera (DCC1545M, Thorlabs, Japan). Initially, the setup was designed
with a Helium-Neon (He-Ne) gas laser with a wavelength of λ
= 632.8 nm and power of 3.4 mW. In order to perform measurements in
the blue regime, an additional experimental setup was constructed
(Figure 1b) exactly
as detailed above only that the laser source was now chosen to be
diode-pumped solid-state (DPSS) laser with a wavelength of λ
= 473 nm and attenuated power of 1 mW (MLL-III-473, CNI, China). The
lens, polarizer, and camera were set on a micrometer stage (distanced
to receive a magnitude of 1) with an angle of 14.5° from the
laser source; hence, the images were corrected accordingly. For each
sample, the intensity images were recorded at multiple planes by moving
the entire camera-polarizer-lens assembly. Samples were held by an
adjustable holder, which was set on a three-axis micrometer stage
for fine-tuning during experiments. Each phantom was tested at three
different points by moving the holder along the x–y planes (as described in Figure 1b).

Solid Tissue-like Phantom
Preparation
For mimicking
media with different optical properties, solid phantoms with different
reduced scattering coefficients were prepared.30 The phantoms were prepared using varying concentrations
of IntraLipid (IL) (IntraLipid 20% Emulsion, Sigma-Aldrich, Israel)
as a scattering component31 and 1% agarose
powder (Agarose - low gelling temperature, Sigma-Aldrich, Israel)
in order to convert the solution into a gel. Double distilled water
(DDW) was heated, while the agarose was slowly added at a mixing temperature
of ∼60 °C. Once the agarose melted, the IL was added to
the solution and mixed for 1 min at a mixing temperature of ∼40
°C in order not to heat the IL. The phantoms were prepared in
cell culture plates (60 mm) and cooled under vacuum conditions (to
avoid bubbles). The phantoms were prepared with a thickness of 10
mm and different IL concentrations (0.4, 0.55, 0.75, 1, 1.25, 1.5,
1.75, and 2% IL). Figure 2 presents the relation between the reduced scattering coefficient
and IL concentrations for solid (red line) and liquid phantoms (black
line) in the blue regime. The relation of the liquid phantoms was
received by extrapolation from Assadi et al.32 For solid phantoms, we used the assumption that there is a factor
smaller than 1 between liquid and solid phantoms.31Table 1 details
the reduced scattering coefficient of solid phantoms in the blue and
red wavelengths.

Figure 2 Calculated reduced scattering coefficient for different
IL concentrations
in the blue regime. For liquid phantoms (black line), μs′ was obtained by an extrapolation from Assadi et al.32 to the range of the IL concentrations we used.
According to Cubeddu et al.,31 there is
a factor (smaller than 1) between liquid and solid phantoms. Here,
a factor of 0.55 was used to receive the relation between μs′ and IL concentrations for solid phantoms (red line).
The equations for both liquid and solid phantoms are located on the
graph with proximity to their respective curves.

Results
IMOPE Theoretical
Model
In order to apply the IMOPE
in the blue regime, some adjustments were made in our theoretical
model. However, for the blue regime, all optical properties had to
be modified accordingly. Hence, λ = 473 nm, g = 0.85, and the absorption coefficient of water μa = 2 × 10–5 mm–1 were used.33−35 As we have described previously,19−21 the phase RMS is calculated
from two areas, which the border between them is approximately 1/μs′: the single-scattering regime (ρ < 1/μs′) and the multiple-scattering regime (ρ >
1/μs′). These two areas have shown their opposite
behavior
in the red regime. The theoretical phase RMS for the single- and multiple-scattering
regimes in the blue wavelength, presented in Figure 3 (dashed and straight black line, respectively),
produced the same behavior as in the red regime (data not shown).
The theoretical model for the blue wavelength is approximately the
same as the one received in the red wavelength.20 This is reasonable, as due to the spectral shift, the main
impact on the phase RMS is the changes of μs′
(μa is still very small and can be neglected compared
to μs′). Given that the phase RMS is presented
with dependence on given μs′ values, the changes
due to spectral shifts are not visible.

Figure 3 Phase RMS obtained theoretically
(black) and experimentally (blue)
for different μs′ values. The phase RMS was
computed from two regimes: single-scattering regime (black dashed
line and blue stars correspond to theory and experiment, respectively)
and multiple-scattering regime (black straight line and blue circles
correspond to theory and experiment, respectively). The theoretical
results were received for the theoretical adjustments of λ =
473 nm, μa = 2 × 10–5 mm–1, and g = 0.85.33−35 For both regimes,
the RMS obtained from experiments produced a standard deviation <0.014.

Scattering Computations of Solid Phantoms
in the Blue Regime
Having our theoretical model in the blue
regime, the scattering
properties of the prepared solid phantoms had to be calculated for
λ = 473 nm. It is known from the red regime that liquid and
solid phantoms with the same IL concentrations have different scattering
properties.31 The relation between IL and
the reduced scattering coefficient for liquid phantoms experiments
in the blue regime was presented32,35 where Flock
et al.35 showed the spectral μs′ for only 10% IL and Assadi et al.32 showed the spectral μs′ for different
IL concentrations. With the purpose of relating IL concentration to
μs′, we have extrapolated the data presented
by Assadi et al.32 to receive the reduced
scattering coefficient values for the IL concentrations. The extrapolation
was done based on the assumption of a linear relation between IL concentration
and μs′ as is known in the red regime.31 Our extrapolation was validated by the Mie theory
approximation where, for 10% IL, the spectral scattering coefficient
μs(λ) and the anisotropy g(λ) calculated by eqs 3 and 4, respectively,36 results in the spectral μs′(λ)
as shown in eq 5: 3   4   5  

Having constructed
μs′ dependency on IL (%) for the liquid phantoms,
the equation y = 1.71x + 0.06 was
received (black line, Figure 2). It is known that, in the red regime, solid and liquid phantoms
both depend linearly on IL concentration where each has a different
slope, mliquid and msolid. The relation between the slopes is msolid/mliquid < 1. Our
second assumption was that, as in the red regime, the relation between
the slopes remains msolid/mliquid < 1. In the red wavelength, Cubeddu et al.31 presented a factor of 0.7. For the blue regime,
we found this factor to be 0.55 based on experiment compatibility
that will be presented in the next paragraph. This resulted in the
red line and its equation y = 0.94x + 0.03, in Figure 2, as the representative for the scattering of solid phantoms in the
blue regime.

Following the translation of IL concentrations
to μs′ for solid phantoms in the blue regime,
based on Figure 2,
our sample optical
properties were calculated, and their values in the red and blue regimes
are presented in Table 1 where the μs′ values in the red wavelength
were taken from Cubeddu et al.31

IMOPE
Experimental Results in the Blue Regime
Solid
phantoms were prepared as described above and measured using the experimental
setup shown in Figure 1b. The reflected light phase from each measurement was reconstructed
by applying the multiple-measurement GS algorithm with M = 7 intensity images at a size of 3.35 mm × 3.35 mm, dz = 0.635 mm, and threshold conditions, which are described
elsewhere.21 The phase was reconstructed
for all measurements from the same location, at a depth of dz·(M – 1) from the surface,
resulting in a propagation distance of 3.81 mm for all measurements.
The reconstructed phase images presented two areas as was received
in the red laser experiments (as shown in Figure 4a,b for μs′ = 1.21
and 1.44 mm–1, respectively).19−21 The border
between these two areas is marked by the white circles in Figure 4 where the areas
inside and outside the circle represent the single- and multiple-scattering
regimes, respectively. Hence, the phase RMS was calculated from the
single- and multiple-scattering regimes (correspond to blue stars
and circles in Figure 3) was compared to the theoretical ones (dashed and straight black
lines in Figure 3),
respectively. Note, as is known from the diffusion theory, changes
in the light source translate to a constant.37 Hence, as the used blue laser is far from being a point source (ω0 ∼1 mm), we add a constant of 0.75 to the experimental
phase RMS values. By comparing the theoretical and experimental phase
RMS for both scattering regimes, we could validate the accurateness
of our IL translation to μs′ for solid phantoms
in the blue wavelength. The compatibility between experiments and
theory produced a factor of 0.55 that was used to calculate the μs′ values of the solid tissue-like phantoms as shown
in Figure 2.

Figure 4 Reconstructed
phase images obtained following the multiple-measurement
GS algorithm for solid phantoms in the blue wavelength with (a) μs′ = 1.21 mm–1 and (b) μs′ = 1.44 mm–1. The border between
the single- and multiple-scattering regimes is marked with the white
circles. The phase was reconstructed using a distance between images
of dz = 0.635 mm, a total propagation distance of
3.81 mm, and an image size of 3.35 mm × 3.35 mm.

Spectral Comparison of Solid Phantom Phase RMS
Having
the phase RMS theoretically and experimentally in the blue regime,
we compared how the wavelength change affects our measurements. For
that, the solid phantoms were measured in the experimental setup with
the red laser as well. The comparison between the obtained phase RMS
in the blue and red laser experiments for the multiple-scattering
regime is presented in Figure 5 by the blue and red circles, respectively. The theoretical
phase RMS of the multiple-scattering regime is also shown in Figure 5 by the black straight
line. The results show high compatibility between the two wavelengths
and theory.

Figure 5 Spectral comparison of the phase RMS for different μs′. The black line represents the theoretical phase
RMS received with the respective parameters of the blue regime. Red
and blue circles correspond to the experimental phase RMS obtained
by using red and blue wavelengths for the multiple-scattering regimes.
The standard deviation for both wavelengths was less than 0.017

Discussion
The theoretical model
of the reflection-based IMOPE for the blue
regime has been presented. Following the required adjustments, the
theoretical model, which describes the phase RMS dependency on μs′, has shown the same behavior we have presented in
previous studies in the red wavelength.19−21 This lays in the fact
that the spectral changes in μs′ are the dominant
changes in comparison to λ, g, and μa. The phase RMS is described for given μs′ values; hence, it is not expected to detect the impact of
the spectral changes through its values. However, for the solid phantoms,
which constitute our calibration experiments, the spectral change
impacts their scattering values greatly. As the search for scattering
properties of solid phantoms in the blue regime provided spectral
information for liquid phantoms only, it had to be translated to solid
phantoms. Reasonable assumptions were made to receive μs′ for solid phantoms in the blue regime: (1) the μs′ linear dependency on the IL concentration and (2)
the relation between liquid and solid phantoms expressed by a factor
smaller than 1. Both assumptions are based on phantom studies from
the red regime.31 To the best of our knowledge,
this paper presents for the first time the relation between μs′ and IL concentration in the blue regime. Notwithstanding,
we recommend performing a thorough study regarding this relation between
liquid and solid phantoms.

The solid phantom experiments produced
a similar curve to the theoretical
model (Figure 3). The
additional bias value of 0.75, which was added to the experimental
phase RMS, is a result of the change of the light source. In the diffusion
reflection theory, the change in the source size is taken into account
by a constant that depends on the source size and intensity.19,37−39 It is known that sources with wider beam waist, that
incident a medium experience smaller beam expansion than narrow beam
sources. Furthermore, the beam expansion occurs deeper in the medium.
Hence, wider beams start with a lower phase RMS that should be compensated
by a constant bias. The source size effect on the reflected phase
and its RMS will have to be quantified in the future studies for constructing
a precise analytical model. Nonetheless, the blue regime reflection-based
IMOPE for extracting scattering properties is presented in this paper.

Conclusions
This paper introduces the spectral reflection-based IMOPE technique
for extracting the reduced scattering coefficient of a medium in the
blue regime. The reflection-based IMOPE, which estimates medium scattering
properties, combines a theoretical model with an experimental setup
and the multiple-measurement GS algorithm. The experimental setup
is used for capturing light intensity images at different locations
along the z axis, which are then being processed
by the multiple-measurement GS algorithm to reconstruct the light
phase. The phase distribution, that is, its RMS, is then computed
and compared to theory for μs′ estimation.

This paper contains, first, the theoretical model for the blue
regime. Then, as the literature provides only the μs′ values of liquid tissue-like phantoms, a computation of
μs′ for solid phantoms is suggested. Finally,
the experimental results of solid tissue-like phantoms in the blue
regime reflection-based IMOPE are presented with high compatibility
to theory and results of the red regime reflection-based IMOPE. The
compatibility of the experimental results between the red and blue
lasers and the theoretical model indicates the applicability of the
IMOPE as a spectral tool for material detection and analysis.
