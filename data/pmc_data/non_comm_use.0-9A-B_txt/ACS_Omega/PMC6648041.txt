It is highly desirable to integrate
the CO2 solubility
benefits of ionic liquids (ILs) in polymeric membrane systems
for effective CO2 separations. Herein, we are exclusively
exploring a series of four novel imidazolium-mediated Tröger’s
base (TB)-containing ionene polymers for enhanced CO2 separation.
The two diimidazole-functionalized Tröger’s base monomers
synthesized from “ortho”- and “para”-substituted
imidazole anilines were polymerized with equimolar amounts of two
different aromatic and aliphatic comonomers (α,α′-dichloro-p-xylene and 1,10-dibromodecane, respectively) via Menshutkin
reactions to obtain four respective ionene polymers ([Im-TB(o&p)-Xy][Cl] and ([Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Br], respectively). The
resulting ionene polymers having halide anions were exchanged with
[Tf2N]− anions, yielding a novel Tröger’s
base material [Im-TB(x)-R][Tf2N] or “Im-TB-Ionenes”.
The structural and physical properties as well as the gas separation
behaviors of the copolymers of aromatic and aliphatic Im-TB-Ionenes
have been extensively investigated with respect to the regiochemistry
of imidazolium groups at the ortho and para positions of the TB unit.
The imidazolium-mediated TB-Ionenes showed high CO2 solubility
and hence an excellent CO2/CH4 permselectivity
of 82.5. The Im-TB-Ionenes also displayed good thermal and mechanical
stabilities.

1 Introduction
Membrane-based
gas separation utilizing polymeric materials has
undoubtedly been at the forefront of separation processes such as
hydrogen recovery in ammonia manufacture (H2/N2 and H2/CH4), CO2 capture and sequestration
(CO2/H2, CO2/N2, and CO2/CH4), N2 or O2 enrichment
of air (O2/N2), and olefin/paraffin separations
in petrochemical industries (C3H6/C3H8).1−6 In general, polymeric membrane-based gas separation is flexible,
easy to scale up, and energy-efficient. However, for a given gas pair,
a strong inherent trade-off between permeability (the product of the
diffusivity and solubility coefficients) and selectivity (the product
of the diffusivity and solubility selectivities) invariably affects
the polymer membranes and limits the gas separation performance.7−9 Improving separation performance of polymeric membranes in aggressive
feeds such as natural gas upgrading (i.e., CO2/light gas
separations) is of great interest and an enduring challenge in gas
separation processes. To prepare highly CO2-permeable membranes,
polymers with a high diffusivity coefficient and/or a high solubility
coefficient must be designed.

Polymers consisting of high-free-volume
elements often yield high
diffusion coefficients and enhance the permeability. A class of soluble
microporous polymers having rigid ladder-like chains containing sites
of contortion, so-called polymers of intrinsic microporosity (PIMs),
is well known for their high fractional free volume (FFV) and high
gas permeabilities.10−14 Recent developments in the design of microporous polymers have turned
to the use of Tröger’s base (TB) derivatives as versatile
new building blocks for the synthesis of extraordinary gas separation
membranes.15−20 Several approaches such as TB polymerization15−17 and TB-based
copolymers18−20 have been proposed to incorporate TB units into the
polymer backbone. In general, the TB moiety is a nitrogen-containing
kinked heterocycle with a V-shaped bridged bicyclic linking group,
a chiral molecule with a site of contortion that can rigidify the
polymer chain and generate microporosity in polymer matrixes. Results
revealed that TB-containing polymer backbones can obtain much higher
CO2 permeabilities due to the large disruptions in chain
packing (i.e., increased FFV) caused by V-shaped tertiary (3°)
amine diazocine bridges and improve the overall gas transport properties,
particularly for CO2/CH4 separation with the
performance surpassing the Robeson upper bound curves.17−20

On the other hand, polymeric membranes either containing or
built
from ionic liquids (ILs) have recently emerged as promising CO2 separation materials due to their high CO2 solubility
and high CO2 gas selectivities over N2 and CH4. Several promising approaches have been applied toward combining
ILs with polymer membranes, including supported ionic liquid membranes
(SILMs),21−23 polymerized IL monomers,24 IL copolymers,25 pendant-IL functionalization,26 and IL composite membranes.27 Initial interest in the use of ILs essentially focused
on the examination of SILMs, in which ILs are impregnated into microporous
polymers to achieve high CO2 permeability as well as high
CO2/N2 selectivity.22 The use of SILMs in practical gas separation processes, however,
is hindered by stability issues as ILs can easily leach out from the
membranes at pressure differences below 1 atm.28 Meanwhile, membranes prepared from polymeric ILs, also
known as poly(IL)s, have become of greater interest than SILMs for
CO2 separation because of their moderate gas separation
properties and superior mechanical properties. Poly(IL)s are not specifically
ILs but rather are polymers containing several forms of ionic salts
with many features shared with ILs, such as their high CO2 solubility. Poly(IL)s also offer a high CO2 sorption
capacity and high sorption and desorption rates compared to ILs.29,30

We have recently focused on the design and synthesis of various
imidazole-functionalized monomers that are integrated into a different
type of poly(IL), called ionenes, an IL-inspired platform where the
polymer backbone contains cationic groups. In our previous work, we
have successfully demonstrated the introduction of imidazolium cations
into the rigid polyimide (PI) backbone via Menshutkin reactions to
form PI–ionene hybrids or “ionic polyimides”.31 Membranes prepared from these newly developed
ionic polyimides displayed high CO2 separation properties,
together with excellent mechanical and thermal stabilities.

In the present work, we combine the benefits of the abovementioned
TB-based polymers and ILs to produce a novel imidazolium-mediated
Tröger’s base-containing ionene polymer for enhanced
CO2 separation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first example of using sterically hindered TB-based-imidazole monomers
(Im-TB(o) and Im-TB(p), Figure 1) to synthesize ionene
polymers for selective CO2 separation. The newly designed
ionenes yielded high-molecular-weight polymers and displayed excellent
thermal and mechanical properties, together with enhanced separation
performance for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 gas pairs. We also investigated the effects of two different
aliphatic and aromatic comonomers (α,α′-dichloro-p-xylene and 1,10-dibromodecane, respectively) used in these
TB-Ionene polymers, which impacted the physical properties as well
as the gas separation behaviors of the corresponding polymer membranes.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of Tröger’s
Base-Containing
Imidazole Monomers (Im-TBs, III)
The Tröger’s
base monomers (III) having “ortho”- and
“para”-substituted diimidazole were synthesized via
a three-step synthetic route, starting from commercially available
imidazole and either 2-fluoronitrobenzene (2-FNB) or 4-fluoronitrobenzene
(4-FNB) to afford IIIa and IIIb, respectively
(Figure 1). The
intermediates (imidazole–aniline derivatives, IIa and IIb) were first synthesized through the reaction
between imidazole and 2-FNB or 4-FNB in the presence of K2CO3 in DMSO at 110 °C, followed
by the Pd/C-catalyzed H2 reduction in EtOH at ambient temperature.
The purity and molecular structures of compounds IIa and IIb were confirmed by 1H NMR (Figures S1 and S2, Supporting Information). The desired Im-TBs
were further synthesized by the condensation reaction between II and paraformaldehyde in the presence of trifluoroacetic
acid (TFA) under ambient conditions. As previously reported,
a mixture of enantiomers (R,R and S,S) can be possible for Im-TBs (III) due to the presence of a V-shaped 3° amine diazocine
bridge.32 Direct comparisons of IIIa and IIIb with their enantiomers, however, were not
considered in this study as Im-TBs exclusively prepared for polymerization.
Nevertheless, both IIIa and IIIb were purified
via recrystallization with DCM–MeOH mixtures. The purity and
structures of Im-TBs were confirmed by H1 NMR (Scheme 1).

2.2 Synthesis
and Characterization of Imidazolium-Mediated
TB-Based Ionene Polymers (Im-TB-Ionene)
As summarized in Scheme 2, a series of four
novel imidazolium-mediated Tröger’s base-containing
ionene polymers (Im-TB-Ionenes) were synthesized. The two diimidazole-functionalized
Tröger’s base monomers synthesized from ortho- and para-substituted
imidazole anilines were first polymerized with equimolar amounts of
two different aromatic and aliphatic comonomers (α,α′-dichloro-p-xylene and 1,10-dibromodecane, respectively) via Menshutkin
reactions to obtain four corresponding ionene polymers ([Im-TB(o&p)-Xy][Cl] and ([Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Br], respectively). The
resulting ionene polymers having halide anions were further exchanged
with [Tf2N]− anions, yielding novel Tröger’s
base-containing ionene materials Im-TB-Ionenes. All the Im-TB-Ionene
polymers were found to have very high number average molecular
weights (e.g., m/z = 169843.8
for [Im-TB(p)-C10][Tf2N]),
as confirmed by high-resolution MALDI-TOF, Figures S3–S6), and similarly, high number average molecular
weights were also reported in our previous works.31,33 The qualitative and quantitative characterizations of newly developed
Im-TB-Ionene polymers were further analyzed by 1H NMR,
FTIR, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) measurements.

Representation of the Preparation of Im-TB-Ionene Polymers
with Their Various Counterparts
The 1H NMR spectra of all four Im-TB-Ionene
polymers
were consistent with their proposed chemical structures. As shown
in Figure 2, the 1H NMR spectra of the Im-TB-Ionene polymers display characteristic
peaks of imidazolium protons (Ha) at 10.0 ppm and the bicyclic
ring of Tröger’s base protons (Hb) in the
region of 3.5–5.5 ppm, indicating the successful incorporation
of imidazolium–TB groups in the polymer backbone. At the same
time, benzylic protons (Hc at 5.5 ppm) of [Im-TB(o&p)-Xy][Tf2N] and alkyl
chain protons (Hc at 1.2 ppm) of [Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Tf2N] were confirmed
due to the presence of aromatic and aliphatic groups in the respective
polymer backbones, proving the structures of newly developed Im-TB-Ionene
polymers (Figure 2).

Figure 2 1H NMR spectra of the Im-TB-Ionene polymers.

As shown in Figure 3, the chemical structures of Im-TB-Ionene polymers were further
verified
by FT-IR. All four Im-TB-Ionene polymers showed the corresponding
peaks of aromatic TB groups (C–H, C–N, and C=C
stretching vibrations at 3082, 1690, and 1480 cm–1, respectively) as well as ionic moieties such as imidazolium cations
(C–N vibrations at 1320 cm–1) and [Tf2N]− anions (SO2 and SNS stretching
vibrations at 1190 and 1050 cm–1, respectively),
indicating that the imidazolium-based TB-Ionene polymers having [Tf2N]− counteranions were successfully formed.34,35 On the other hand, the new peaks corresponding to the aliphatic
groups (C–H stretching vibrations at 2860 cm–1) were only found for [Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Tf2N] polymers, confirming the structural
variations in newly developed Im-TB-Ionene polymers.

Figure 3 FT-IR spectra of the
Im-TB-Ionene polymers.

The thermal stabilities of Im-TB-Ionene polymers were evaluated
by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under a N2 atmosphere
(Figure 4). All six
Im-TB-Ionene polymers exhibited very similar thermograms with two-stage
degradations, the first of which occurring between 350 and 480 °C
was attributed to the decomposition of the major ionene backbone,
followed by the evolution of the residual ionic char at approximately
480–650 °C. In general, the TGA results showed that Im-TB-Ionene
polymers are highly stable and adequate for gas separation applications.

of the Im-TB-Ionene polymers.

2.3 Membrane Fabrication of Im-TB-Ionene Polymers
The Im-TB-Ionene polymers displayed high solubility in common polar
aprotic solvents including DMAc, DMSO, and NMP (Table S1, Supporting Information). The excellent solubility
indicated the compatibility of the newly developed ionene materials
to form thin films. The corresponding membranes were prepared by casting
a DMAc solution of respective Im-TB-Ionene polymers, followed by vacuum
drying to give dense, transparent, and flexible membranes (the optical
images are shown in Figure 5). Before use for characterization tests, the membranes were
washed with hexane and dried for 24 h under ambient conditions to
remove any residual solvents. The thickness of the Im-TB-Ionene membranes
was controlled to be 90 to 110 μm.

polymer membranes (diameter =
47 mm).

2.4 Physical
Properties of Im-TB-Ionene Polymers
The effect on thermal
transitions of Im-TB-Ionene polymers as a
function of imidazolium groups as well as hard and soft segments (aromatic
and aliphatic comonomers, respectively) was investigated using DSC
analysis (Table 1 and Figure 6). The ionic polymers
often yield lower glass transition temperature (Tg) values, which is proportional to the ratio of the counterion
charge to the distance between the centers of cations and anions.36 Interestingly, in the newly developed Im-TB-Ionenes,
the aromatic hard segments containing ionenes ([Im-TB(o&p)-Xy][Tf2N]) possessed a similar
high Tg around 100 °C, which was
even much higher than those obtained from other imidazolium–ionenes.
Although slightly lower Tg values (≤80
°C) were observed for the aliphatic soft segment [Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Tf2N] ionenes, similar values were also reported for imidazolium ionenes
with butyl chains.37 The lower Tg values were attributed to a looser packing
of the ionene groups within the flexible aliphatic networks, suggesting
that chain mobility of the ionenes was high, and hence, enhanced gas
permeability was expected for the membrane with this combinational
series. Most notably, a much lower Tg of
55 °C was observed for the ortho-positioned aliphatic Im-TB-Ionene
polymer, [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N].

[Im-TB(p)-Xy][Tf2N]	98	4.7	1.39	
[Im-TB(p)-C10][Tf2N]	80	4.6	1.35	
To further investigate
the chemical structures and chain packing
architectures of the newly developed ionenes, wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) was performed. As shown in Figure 7, there were no sharp peaks exhibited in
all X-ray diffraction patterns, indicating the amorphous structures
of Im-TB-Ionenes. Whereas both the aromatic copolymers [Im-TB(o&p)-Xy][Tf2N] displayed
a single-peak distribution, a bimodal distribution was obtained for
aliphatic copolymers [Im-TB(o&p)-C10][Tf2N], which is plausible because of
the enhanced chain mobility of ionenes caused by alkyl chains. However,
the intersegmental d spacing values of Im-TB-Ionenes
calculated from the main halo (2θ = 21–22°) remained
constant irrespective of their molecular structure, except for [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] (Table 1). The main halo in [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] was shifted from 2θ of 21.5
to 17.2° and resulted in a high d spacing of
5.9 Å. The relatively higher d spacing of [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] can be attributed to
the introduction of the alkyl groups into the ortho positions of the
imidazolium–TB unit, which disrupts the chain packing of ionenes
and increases the d spacing.

Figure 7 Wide-angle X-ray diffraction
plots obtained from the Im-TB-Ionene
membranes.

Generally, the d spacing represents the distance
between the polymer chain segments, and the increase in the d spacing values of [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] might lead to a decrease in the density. The [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] yielded the lowest density
among the four Im-TB-Ionene polymers (Table 1). These results clearly suggested an increased
free volume distribution and hence enhanced gas transport properties
in the [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N]
membrane (see below).

2.5 Gas Transport Properties
of Im-TB-Ionene Polymers
The pure gas permeabilities and
permselectivities of the Im-TB-Ionene
membranes were measured at 3 atm and 20 °C using a lab-made high-vacuum
time-lag unit according to the constant volume–variable pressure
method, as summarized in Table 2. The permeability of Im-TB-Ionenes follows the sequence of
the kinetic diameter of the respective gas molecules: CO2 (3.3 Å) > N2 (3.6 Å) > CH4 (3.8
Å), a trend that indicates the size-selective chain packing of
the newly developed ionenes due to the presence of TB units. As shown
in Table 2, the gas
permeabilities of aromatic segments containing ionenes displayed a
similar result irrespective of their ortho and para substructures;
for example, the CO2 permeabilities of [Im-TB(o)-Xy][Tf2N] and [Im-TB(p)-Xy][Tf2N] were 1.99 and 2.02 barrer, respectively. In contrast, the
aliphatic segments containing ionenes exhibited a dramatic increase
in permeabilities, especially the ortho-positioned [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] ionene, due to the enhanced
diffusivity as well as solubility coefficients (Table 3). [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] showed the best permeabilities among the four
Im-TB-Ionenes; for example, the CO2 permeability of [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] was 4.37 barrer (increased
by about 2-fold). This provides further evidence that the alkyl groups
in the ortho position of the imidazolium–TB unit effectively
improve the flexibility in the polymer chain, which is consistent
with the d spacing data and the thermal transition
properties (lower Tg was obtained for
[Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N]).

On the other hand, the CO2 solubility in the Im-TB-Ionenes
was much higher than the N2 or CH4 solubilities (Table 3). As a result, all
the Im-TB-Ionenes obtained excellent CO2/N2 and
CO2/CH4 permselectivities. [Im-TB(o)-C10][Tf2N] showed an extraordinary high CO2/CH4 permselectivity of 82.5.

The permeability–selectivity
tradeoff results obtained for
the CO2/CH4 (Figure 8a) and CO2/N2 (Figure 8b) separations in
the membranes prepared from Im-TB-Ionenes were then compared to the
upper bound of the Robeson plot.7,9 Data from other imidazolium-based
ionenes,38 poly(IL)s,24,39,40 and Tröger’s base-containing
polymers16,18−20 are also included for
comparison. Although the permeability–selectivity values of
the Im-TB-Ionenes fell below the upper bound lines for CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2, their performances
were comparable to the published data for poly(IL)s and ionenes. Although
the separation performance of all the Im-TB-Ionenes for CO2/N2 fell within the general range of other poly(IL)s and
the ionenes, CO2/CH4 outperformed the previously
described ionene-based membranes (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 Robeson upper bound plot for comparing the (a)
CO2/CH4 and (b) CO2/N2 separation performances
of the Im-TB-Ionenes with other previously reported ionenes, poly(IL)s,
and Tröger’s base-containing polymers. Data were taken
from refs (7)(9)(16)(18)(19)(20)(24)(38)(39), and (40).

At the same time, a direct comparison of the newly developed
Im-TB-Ionenes
with the recently reported Tröger’s base-containing
polymers could not have been made because of the low permeability
as well as the differences in the polymeric backbone. The relatively
low gas permeabilities of these Im-TB-Ionenes might be due to either
too much or insufficient amounts of the imidazolium–TB moiety
present in the polymer backbone. These factors can be further optimized;
the polymer backbone in Im-TB-Ionenes can potentially be fine-tuned
by introducing more permeable polymers, such as polyimides. We foresee
an extension study that uses bisindane-based dianhydrides (i.e., PIMs)
and the benefits of regiochemistry of Im-TBs (i.e., use of ortho Im-TB)
in our forthcoming works. Overall, the Im-TB-Ionenes prepared here
provide a novel approach to introducing imidazolium-TB groups into
a variety of polymer structures for use in gas separations,18,41 CO2 capture,42,43 catalysis,44 and electrochemical applications.45,46

3 Conclusions
We prepared a series of
novel imidazolium-mediated Tröger’s
base-containing ionenes and successfully demonstrated the potential
utility of the corresponding membranes for CO2 gas separation.
This is the first example of the incorporation of Tröger’s
base groups into the imidazolium–ionene polymers to serve as
a CO2 selective separation membrane. We investigated the
effects of Im-TB-Ionenes on the structures and properties of the polymers
as well as the gas separation properties of the corresponding polymer
membranes by varying the regiochemistry of imidazolium groups in TB
units and the presence of aromatic and aliphatic co-monomers. All
newly developed Im-TB-Ionene polymers exhibited high molecular weight,
excellent solubility in polar organic solvents, and high thermal stability.
The Im-TB-Ionene membranes showed superior CO2/CH4 and CO2/N2 selectivities with reasonable gas
permeability yields. This simple strategy may be readily applied toward
preparing more extraordinary polymer membranes for CO2 separation
applications.

Ionene Polymers (Im-TB-Ionenes)
4.3.1 Synthesis
of Imidazole–Aniline Derivatives
(IIa and IIb)
For preparing the
ortho derivative (IIa), imidazole (24.125 g, 354 mmol),
2-fluoronitrobenzene (2-FNB, 25.000 g, 177 mmol), and potassium carbonate
(K2CO3, 26.936 g, 195 mmol) were added with
300 mL of DMSO to a 1000 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic
stir bar. The vessel was capped with a rubber stopper and vented with
a needle through the cap to prevent the buildup of pressure in the
flask upon heating. The reaction was heated to 110 °C while stirring
for 24 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and poured into
700 mL of DI water to precipitate the product and remove excess imidazole.
The product was filtered and then added back to a 500 mL round-bottom
flask with 250 mL of Et2O. The product was left to stir
in Et2O for 24 h to remove unreacted 2-FNB. The product
was filtered and washed with 100 mL of Et2O and dried in
a vacuum oven at 60 °C, yielding 1-(2-nitrophenyl)imidazoleproduct
as a light yellow powder (26.973 g, 80%).

1-(2-nitrophenyl)imidazole
(32.496 g, 172 mmol) was added with 300 mL of EtOH to a 500 mL round-bottom
heavy-walled pressure vessel (Ace Glass) sealed with a threaded PTFE
cap with a DuPont Kalrez O ring. Pd/C (1.100 g) was added to the flask,
and the vessel was sealed with a Teflon screw cap fitted with Swagelok
stainless steel fittings and tubing to accommodate for a gas inlet
and a vacuum line. The reaction was set to stir with a H2 feed (30 psi) for 48 h. The contents of the reaction were filtered
through Celite to isolate the Pd/C for disposal, and the EtOH filtrate
was transferred to a round-bottom flask. The solvent was removed via

at 60 °C overnight to yield an off-white  solid (17.621
g, 77%). 1H NMR (360 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 7.74 (t, J = 1.1 Hz, 1H), 7.30 (t, J = 1.3 Hz, 1H), 7.14 (ddd, J = 8.1, 7.3,

The para derivative (IIb) was synthesized
by the same
method from imidazole (24.125 g, 354 mmol), 4-fluoronitrobenzene (4-FNB,
25.000 g, 177 mmol), and K2CO3 (26.936 g, 195
mmol) in 300 mL of DMSO. The purified and dried product was collected
as a light yellow powder (32.496 g, 97%). 1-(4-nitrophenyl)imidazole
was reduced following the same procedure in EtOH (300 mL) with Pd/C
(0.95 g). The product was recovered via removal of EtOH and dried
under vacuum to yield an off-white solid (22.164 g, 80%). 1H NMR (500 MHz, DMSO-d6) δ 7.95

4.3.2 Synthesis
of Tröger’s Base-Containing
Imidazole Monomers (Im-TB, IIIa, and IIIb)
Following a literature method for the preparation of ortho
and para Im-TBs,32 cooled (−15 °C)
trifluoroacetic acid (200 mL) was added to IIa or IIb (10 g, 62.82 mmol) at −15 °C; subsequently,
paraformaldehyde (4.72 g, 157.1 mmol) was added to the reaction mixture
and allowed to stir at room temperature for 40 h. After the reaction,
the resultant mixture was quenched by pouring into it crushed ice
(900 g) followed by the addition of 30% aqueous ammonia solution (150
mL). The organic components were extracted with dichloromethane (3
× 200 mL), washed with brine solution, and dried over anhydrous
MgSO4, and the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure
to obtain a crude gummy compound. The product was purified by recrystallization
from a MeOH–DCM mixture to give off-white crystals.

IIa (off-white crystals): Yield (75%). 1H NMR (DMSO-d6) δ 8.05 (s, 2H, J =
3.7, 2×N=CH—N), 7.60 (s, 2H, J = 7.4, 2 × N—CH=C),

2 × N–CH–N), and 3.24 (s, 2H,

2 × N–CH2–C).

4.3.3 Synthesis of Four Im-TB-Ionenes
To a DMF (50 mL) solution
of Im-TB IIIa or IIIb (4 g, 11.29 mmol),
the corresponding equimolar comonomer (11.29
mmol, 1.98 g for α,α′-dichloro-p-xylene (DCXy) and 3.39 g for 1,10-dibromodecane (DBC10)was added into a heavy-walled round-bottom flask (Ace Glass) equipped
with a magnetic stir bar. Then, the flask was sealed with a threaded
PTFE cap and a DuPont Kalrez O ring. The reaction mixture was heated
to 110 °C and allowed to stir for 24 h. After this time, the
precipitated polymer product was cooled to room temperature, the remaining
DMF was decanted, and deionized H2O was added directly
to the flask. The vessel was heated to 40 °C while stirring to
dissolve the dark brown solids. LiTf2N (8.1g, 28.2 mmol)
was dissolved in 200 mL of DI water in a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask,
and the dissolved polymer product from the flask was poured into the
aqueous LiTf2N solution, whereupon a precipitate immediately
formed. The mixture was vigorously stirred with an overhead mechanical
stirrer for 1 h, and the polymer was collected by filtration and dried
in a vacuum oven for 36 h at 80 °C to give the desired Im-TB-Ionene
polymer.

4.4 Synthesis Im-TB-Ionene Membranes
All the Im-TB-Ionene
membranes were prepared by the solution-casting
method using DMAc as solvent. The corresponding ionene polymers (1.2
g, 10 wt %) were dissolved in DMAc (10.8 g, 90 wt %) and sonicated
at 30 °C until they formed completely homogeneous solutions.
The resultant solutions were filtered through a cotton plug to ensure
that the solution was free of any dust particles and poured onto a
Teflon block. The Teflon plates were then placed in an oven, covered
with aluminum foil having small holes, underwent slow solvent evaporation
at 40 °C for 96 h, and further dried at 60 °C for 48 h in
a vacuum oven. After becoming completely dried, the membranes were
peeled off from the Teflon plate and then dried at ambient temperature.
The membrane thickness was controlled to be 90 to 110 μm.

4.5 Membrane Characterization
The densities
of the membranes (g cm–3) were determined experimentally
using a top-loading electronic Mettler Toledo balance (XP205, Mettler
Toledo, Switzerland) coupled with a density kit based on Archimedes’
principle. The samples were weighed in air, and a known-density liquid
(high-purity heptane) was used. All measurements were carried out
at room temperature by the buoyancy method, and the density was calculated
as follows  where W0 and W1 are the membrane weights in air and water,
respectively. The liquid sorption of the Im-TB-Ionene membranes was
not considered due to their extremely low swelling property.

The glass transition temperature (Tg)
of each Im-TB-Ionene polymer was measured by DSC (TA Instruments,
DSC Q20) from 20 to 300 °C with a scan rate of 10 °C min–1 under N2.

The wide-angle X-ray diffraction
(WAXD) patterns of the membranes
were measured using a Bruker D8 Discover diffractometer by employing
a scanning rate of 4°/min in a 2θ range from 5 to 60°
with a Co Kα1 X-ray (λ = 0.17886) source. The d spacing values were calculated using Bragg’s law
(d = λ/2sin θ).

4.6 Gas Separation
Measurements
The pure
gas permeation measurements were performed to determine the gas separation
abilities of the newly developed Im-TB-Ionene polymer membranes using
high-vacuum time-lag apparatus based on the constant volume–variable
pressure method. The construction and operation of this measurement
unit were already discussed in our previous works.39,47 The only addition to the construction was that Im-TB-Ionene membranes
were “masked” on both sides using adhesive aluminum
tape to confine gas permeation through a fixed membrane area of 1/2 in. diameter, as described elsewhere.48 All measurements were ideal (i.e., single gas)
and performed at 20 °C, and the feed pressure was ∼3 atm
(∼45 psia) against an initial downstream vacuum (<0.01 psia).
Pressures and temperatures were measured and recorded using the most
recent version of LabVIEW software (National Instruments). After each
measurement, the unit was held under dynamic vacuum (<0.01 psia)
for at least 16 h at ambient temperature. The pressure rise versus
time transient signals of the permeate side, equipped with a pressure
transducer, were recorded and passed to a desktop computer through
a shield data cable. The permeability coefficient was determined from
the linear slope of the downstream pressure rise versus time plot
(dp/dt) according to the following
equation  where P is the permeability
expressed in barrer (1 barrer = 10–10 cmSTP3 cm cm–2 s–1 cmHg–1), V (cm3) is the downstream
volume, l (cm) is the membrane thickness, A (cm2) is the effective area of the membrane, T (K) is the temperature of measurement, p0 (Torr) is the pressure of the feed gas in the upstream
chamber, and dp/dt is the rate of
the pressure rise in the steady state. Assuming the solution–diffusion
(S–D) mechanism, the diffusivity
(Di) of each gas was calculated from the
time lag (Θ) and membrane thickness (l), and
the solubility (Si) of each gas was calculated
as the quotient of Pi and Di. The pure gas permeability, solubility, and diffusivity
selectivity (αi,j) for a given gas pair (e.g., CO2/N2) were calculated as Pi/Pj, Si/Sj, and Di/Dj, respectively.
