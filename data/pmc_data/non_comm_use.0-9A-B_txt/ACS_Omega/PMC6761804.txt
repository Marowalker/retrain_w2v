Colorectal
cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the
fourth leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Integrin α6
is overexpressed in all stages of CRC which makes it a potential diagnostic
biomarker for CRC. Previously, we identified an integrin α6-targeted
peptide CRWYDENAC (dubbed RWY) using phage display technology and
employed it for nasopharyngeal carcinoma specific nanotherapeutics.
In this study, we developed a radiotracer, 18F-RWY, based
on this integrin α6-targeted RWY peptide for positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging of CRC. Integrin α6 was overexpressed
on several CRC cells including HT29 cells where the biotin-labeled
RWY peptide colocalized with integrin α6. 18F-RWY
PET imaging was performed on subcutaneous, chemically induced, and
genetically engineered CRC mice. 18F-RWY generated high
PET signals in subcutaneous HT29 tumors, and the tumor uptake of 18F-RWY was reduced by a blocking study using nonradio-labeled
RWY. Moreover, 18F-RWY PET imaging enabled detection of
CRC in chemically induced and genetically engineered CRC mice. The
overexpression of integrin α6 in tumor tissues isolated from
chemically induced and genetically engineered CRC mice was confirmed.
These results demonstrate the potential clinical application of 18F-RWY for PET imaging of CRC.

Introduction
Colorectal cancer (CRC),
which accounted for 1.7 million new cases
and more than 800 000 deaths in 2018, is the third most common
cancer worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths, with
its incidence increasing each year.1,2 Surgical resection
is an effective treatment for patients with localized stage CRC, with
a 5-year survival rate of up to 90% being observed.2 Early diagnosis of CRC is critical for the choice of follow-up
treatment and prognosis of patients. Currently, the gold standard
for the diagnosis of CRC relies on the pathological report of the
biopsy samples taken during endoscopy. Complete colonoscopy or computed
tomography (CT) colonoscopy is necessary for the staging of CRC. As
a noninvasive method of tumor detection, positron emission tomography/CT
(PET/CT) is crucial for the performance of presurgical staging and
identification of metastatic or recurrent lesions.3 PET/CT has been shown to alter the therapy of nearly one-third
of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer.4

18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
is the most
widely clinically used PET radiotracer for the detection of cancers.
The growth and proliferation of malignant cells are active and accelerated,
and glucose utilization and glycolysis are significantly increased.
Therefore, the concentration of deoxyglucose in tumor cells is significantly
higher than that in normal cells.5 As an
important organ for nutrient absorption, the colon is adjacent to
the small intestine, where glucose uptake is active, and physiological
glucose uptake in the gastrointestinal tracts may lead to misinterpretation
of PET/CT results of 18F-FDG.4 In addition, some organs with high glucose metabolism, such as the
brain and the heart, often show a high standardized uptake value (SUV)
in 18F-FDG based PET images, which makes it difficult to
distinguish the metastases of these organs.6

Integrin α6 is a subtype of the integrin family, which
is
expressed on the surface of cells and acts as a regulator of a variety
of cellular functions that are critical to the occurrence, development,
and metastasis of solid tumors.7 Several
studies have reported the prognostic significance of integrin α6
in several tumors including hepatocellular carcinoma,8 breast cancer,9 and bladder
cancer.10 Previously, we identified a tumor-targeted
peptide CRWYDENAC (dubbed RWY) using phage display technology and
further confirmed its target as integrin α6.11 Many studies have suggested that integrin α6 is overexpressed
in CRC, and its overexpression is associated with the development
of more aggressive and metastatic phenotypes in CRC cells.12,13 The notably high expression level of integrin α6 in CRC makes
it a potential target for molecular imaging of CRC. In this study,
we develop an integrin α6-targeted RWY-based PET radiotracer 18F-ALF-NOTA-RWY (dubbed 18F-RWY for short) for
PET imaging of CRC in subcutaneous, genetically engineered and chemically
induced CRC mice.

Results
Binding of RWY to CRC Cells
The expression levels of
integrin α6 were examined on several CRC cells including RKO,
HCT116, LS-174T, SW620 and HT29, and normal colorectal epithelial
FHC cells. High expression of integrin α6 was observed in LS-174T
and HT29 cells; medium expression in HCT116 and SW620 cells; and low
expression in FHC and RKO cells (Figure 1A). The integrin α6-overexpressing
CRC cell HT29 was used in our following studies. Confocal imaging
showed that biotin-labeled RWY peptide colocalized with integrin α6
in HT29 cells (Figure 1B).

Development of an Integrin α6-Targeted
PET Radiotracer
We synthesized a 1,4,7-triazacyclononanetriacetic
acid (NOTA)-conjugated
RWY peptide that was radiolabeled with radionuclide fluorine-18 (18F) to form a PET radiotracer 18F-ALF-NOTA-RWY
(dubbed 18F-RWY for short) (Figure 2), according to a previous report.14 The stability of 18F-RWY was determined
by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). A unique radioactive
peak was observed by HPLC (Figure S1),
indicating that 18F-RWY was stable.

Biodistribution in a Subcutaneous
CRC Mouse Model
Mice-bearing
HT29 subcutaneous xenograft tumors were intravenously injected with
3.7 MBq (100 μCi) of 18F-RWY. Mice were sacrificed
60 min after intravenous injection. Tumor tissues and normal organs
were harvested, weighed, and measured by a γ counter. Quantification
indicated the highest radioactive accumulation of 18F-RWY
in the kidneys, suggesting it was predominantly cleared by the urinary
system (Figure 3A).
Tissue uptake in tumor tissues was higher than in other normal tissues
and organs (including the bone, skin, lungs, blood, intestines, heart,
liver, spleen, and brain) except for the kidneys (Figure 3B).

(n = 3). (B) Tumor-to-organ ratios of 18F-RWY at 60 min postinjection (n = 3).

To analyze the dynamic distribution of 18F-RWY
in vivo,
a dynamic PET/CT imaging was performed. The time activity curves for
tumor and muscle were calculated. As shown in (Figure 4A), the accumulation of 18F-RWY
in the tumor reached peak in approximately 5 min and remained stable
during 60 min postinjection. Similar trends were observed in muscle.
Comparatively, the radiotracer uptake in the tumor was approximately
three folds higher than that observed in muscle during 60 min postinjection
(Figure 4B).

ratio was calculated (n = 3).

To further confirm the binding specificity of 18F-RWY,
an in vivo blocking assay was performed by tail vein injection of
1 mg of nonradiolabeled RWY peptide before injection of 18F-RWY (Figure 5A).
The PET signal in the tumor was dramatically reduced from 3.99 ±
0.22 to 1.99 ± 0.14 % ID/g (Figure 5B), suggesting that the tumor accumulation
of 18F-RWY was mediated by the RWY peptide.

analysis was performed using Student’s t-test, n = 3, **p < 0.01.

PET/CT Imaging on Chemically Induced and Genetically Engineered
CRC mice
In chemically induced CRC mice, 18F-RWY
showed high tumor uptake and low background uptake. Tumor uptake of 18F-RWY was quantified as 5.87 ± 0.99 % ID/g (Figure 6A). In the 3D model
image, the 18F-RWY displayed excellent tumor enrichment
(Figure S2). To further confirm the presence
of the tumor, mice were sacrificed 24 h after PET/CT imaging until
the radioactivity decayed to negligible amounts. The colon and rectum
were collected for observations, including H&E staining as well
as immunohistochemistry. Gross and microscopic observations showed
that the tumor was successfully induced in the colon, which was also
confirmed by H&E staining results. High integrin α6 expression
in the tumor tissues was observed in the image of immunohistochemistry
compared with that in the intestine adjacent to the tumor (Figure 6B).

In an Apcmin/+ genetically engineered
CRC mouse, representative PET/CT and maximum intensity projection
imaging displayed an excellent targeting effect of the 18F-RWY. The maximum value of calculated tumor uptake was 5.74 ±
0.71 % ID/g (Figure 7A). In the 3D model image, the 18F-RWY also showed excellent
tumor targeting (Figure S3). Compared with 18F-RWY, 18F-FDG did not show ideal tumor enrichment.
Instead, it was mainly enriched in some nonspecific sites, such as
the heart, the brain, and the subcutaneous adipose tissue (Figure S4). H&E staining confirmed the presence
of the tumor in the colon. Immunohistochemistry showed that tumor
tissues showed relatively high expression of integrin α6 compared
to the intestine tissues adjacent to the tumor (Figure 7B).

Discussion
Previously, we identified a tumor-targeted peptide
RWY using phage
display technology and further confirmed its target as integrin α6.11 Herein, we developed an integrin α6-targeted
PET radiotracer, 18F-RWY, and focused its application on
CRC. The integrin α6-overexpressing CRC cells HT29 were used
to establish subcutaneous CRC tumors. We confirmed that integrin α6
is the primary cellular target of the RWY peptide, and the RWY peptide
binds to integrin α6 CRC cells in vitro. In the blocking assay,
we further confirmed the specificity of 18F-RWY binding
to the subcutaneous tumor of CRC, thereby suggesting that 18F-RWY can effectively and specifically accumulate in CRC tumors.
We further validated the feasibility of 18F-RWY for the
detection of CRC in chemically induced and genetically engineered
CRC mice as well. We finally confirmed the overexpression of integrin
α6 in tumor tissues isolated from chemically induced and genetically
engineered CRC mice.

Diagnosis and monitoring of CRC rely heavily
on colonoscopy. Nevertheless,
as an invasive technique, colonoscopy requires a long period of bowel
preparation and anesthesia to reduce pain, which is intolerable for
some patients.15 Colonoscopy, on the other
hand, is highly dependent on the experience of the operator, and detection
of neoplasms in the occult site is often difficult because of blind
spots.16 Approximately 26% of neoplastic
polyps was missed during single colonoscopy, according to a meta-analysis.17 For verdant operators, unskilled manipulation
is likely to lead to bleeding, perforation, and other severe complications.
Therefore, more noninvasive approaches are still urgently needed to
be explored for better diagnosis of CRC.

With the introduction
and rapid development of precision medicine,
it is necessary to explore tumor biomarkers that can reflect changes
on the tumor cell and subcell level before changes in the anatomic
structure.18,19 Because of the noninvasiveness,
high sensitivity, and lack of blind spots, the PET imaging modality
is widely accepted in oncological imaging. PET imaging based on tumor-targeting
molecules has been rapidly developed and has achieved good results
in many cancers.1918F-FDG,
a PET radiotracer based on glucose metabolism, is the most widely
used for oncological imaging. However, because of the abnormal absorbability
of inflammatory lesions, metabolism-based imaging often confuses malignant
lesions with chronic inflammatory lesions.20 Elevation of glucose metabolism is common in inflammatory lesions
such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease.21 Even in the normal colon and rectum, there is
a certain amount of physiological glucose uptake, which hampers the
application of 18F-FDG as a PET radiotracer in colorectal
oncological imaging.4 In addition, it is
also difficult to distinguish the metastases of organs with high glucose
metabolism, such as the brain.6

In
this study, we provided a noninvasive oncological imaging modality
for molecular imaging of CRC via targeting to integrin α6. Early
CRC with a localized stage can be successfully treated before distant
metastasis occurs.22 The ability to detect
early colorectal lesions at a curable stage is the most important
criterion for CRC screening. The overexpression of integrin α6
in a majority of CRCs has been reported by several publications.23−25 Elevation of this molecule occurs long before the changes in the
anatomical structure when the tumor is visible to the naked eye. Most
notably, integrin α6, which plays an important role in proliferation
of tumor cells, was found to be upregulated in more than 80% of CRCs
in transcription levels.24,25 The extremely high
positive ratio of integrin α6 in CRC makes it a good molecular
imaging target for the sensitive detection of CRC. Moreover, Beaulieu
et al.26 found that the integrin α6
subunit transcript (ITGA6) levels were significantly
increased at all stages of CRC and could serve as a part of a stool
assay to detect early colorectal lesions. The overexpression of integrin
α6 in the early stage of CRC enlightened us that PET imaging
with 18F-RWY may serve as a new approach for the detection
of early CRC. On the other hand, PET/CT can determine whether there
is early metastasis, thereby eliminating unnecessary examination in
clinical practice.

Nevertheless, there are still several limitations
of our study.
First, as we can see in the results, the uptakes of the PET radiotracer 18F-RWY in tumor and other tissues reach a peak in only a few
minutes, and the rapid clearance of 18F-RWY in vivo may
reduce the sensitivity of CRC detection. The addition of modified
chemical groups to alter its metabolism may prolong its half-life
in vivo. Second, the binding affinity between RWY and integrin α6
still need improvement. The affinity analysis between the synthesized
integrin α6 protein and RWY by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
is a direct method. One of our on-going studies is to improve the
binding affinity via optimizing the peptide structure. Third, endoscopy
is still the most commonly used method for the diagnosis of CRC currently.
The gold standard for the diagnosis of CRC still depends on the pathological
examination of tissue collected by endoscopy. Moreover, the high price
of PET/CT imaging hampers its application as an early screening approach
in clinical practice. However, from another point of view, this imaging
will be beneficial for patients who need PET/CT examination during
the perioperative period because the performance of PET/CT with our
new radiopharmaceuticals can directly be used to diagnose and evaluate
metastasis without the requirement of endoscopic examination anymore.
Only a limited number of mice has been used for the detection of CRC.
A series of clinical trials are needed to assess the effectiveness
of this method in humans before it can be used clinically.

Conclusions
Integrin α6 was overexpressed on several CRC cells and tumor
tissues isolated from chemically induced and genetically engineered
CRC mice. Integrin α6 was the primary cellular target of RWY
peptide, and the RWY peptide binds to CRC cells in vitro and in vivo.
The integrin α6-targeted peptide-based radiotracer 18F-RWY is feasible for PET imaging of CRC in subcutaneous, chemically
induced, and genetically engineered CRC mouse models, suggesting its
future clinical applications.

Experimental Section
Cells and Animal Models
All the cell lines used in
the experiment were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC). Normal intestinal epithelial cell line FHC was cultured in
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium: F-12 medium (ATCC
30-2006), and human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line (HT29, LS-174T,
RKO, HCT116, and SW620) was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented
with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL
streptomycin. The cells were maintained in an incubator with a humid
atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37 °C. All mice were purchased
from Vital River, Charles River Laboratories China (Beijing, China).
The animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the animal welfare
and ethics committees of Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Approximately,
1 × 107 cells in a suspension with 20% Matrigel (Corning
354234, USA) were subcutaneously injected into the lateral thigh of
BALB/c nude mice to create a subcutaneous tumor. To obtain a chemical-induced
CRC mouse model, azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium were purchased
from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and administrated to C57BL6 mice based
on the previous literature.27 Mice were
scanned by PET 80 days after drugs’ induction. Apcmin/+ mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory
(Bar Harbor, ME) and maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions
in the Guangdong Pharmaceutical University Animal Experimental Center.
Genotyping was tested by PCR with toe DNA using primers as follows:
P1, 5′-TTCTGAGAAAGACAGAAGTTA-3′, together with P2, 5′-TTCCACTTTGGCATAAGGC-3′,
was used to detect the mutant Apc allele (313 bp),
which is only present in heterozygous Apcmin/+ mice. P3, 5′-GCCATCCCTTCACGTTAG-3′, together with
the Apc-common primer, was used to detect the wild-type
allele (619 bp).28

Biodistribution
To investigate the biodistribution
of 18F-RWY in vivo, the mice bearing HT29 were euthanized
60 min after intravenous injection of 18F-RWY. Tumor and
normal organs were collected, and the radioactivity was measured by
a γ counter (Wallac Wizard 1470, PerkinElmer Inc.). The organs
were weighed to calculate their mean organ distribution. Radioactivity
was expressed as a percentage of the injected dose per gram [% ID/g,
mean ± standard deviation (SD), n = 3/group].

PET/CT Imaging
The peptide powder previously freeze-dried
was dissolved in saline and added to with 5 μL of acetic acid,
324 μL of ethanol and 370 MBq of fluoride ion (approximately
10 mCi). The mixture was boiled for 10 min and cooled to room temperature.
The 18F-RWY was captured by a C18 plus column (Waters,
Sep-Pak, USA) because the free fluoride ion can pass through the column.
After being washed with saline twice, the peptide was eluted with
400 μL of ethanol, and the obtained solution was blown in nitrogen
until the liquid was almost evaporated. A volume of 200 μL saline
was added after the radioactivity was measured. Mice were anesthetized
with 2.5% tribromoethanol (T48402, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) and intravenously
injected with approximately 3.7 MBq (100 μCi) of 18F-RWY or 18F-FDG. PET/CT was performed after 1 h in vivo
circulation with the imaging agent. To analyze the enrichment of the
tracer in the tumor, regions of interest were drawn on tumors in three
dimensions, and the maximum uptake value was calculated. The tumor
and tissue densities were assumed as 1 g/cm3, and its uptake
is presented as the % ID/g and was calculated by measuring the tumor
and tissue radioactivity. To perform dynamic imaging, the images were
acquired as follows: 1 × 5, 1 × 25, 9 × 30, 5 ×
60, 5 × 120, and 9 × 240 s. Time activity curves were obtained
according to the pharmacokinetics of 18F-RWY in the tumors
and other organs. The uptake of the tracer was quantified as SUV.

Immunohistochemistry
Tumors from mouse models were
carefully dissected, fixed with formalin, and embedded with paraffin.
Paraffin blocks were cut into 3 mm sections and some were stained
with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). The remaining sections were
deparaffinized in xylene and dehydrated by serial immersion in 100,
90, 80, and 70% ethanol and distilled water. Antigen retrieval was
performed under high pressure with boiling citrate buffer (10 mM,
pH 9.0) for 3 min. All samples were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin
and incubated with anti-integrin α6 antibody (Abcam, ab181551)
at a dilution of 1:150 overnight at 4 °C. After washing with
PBST three times, the samples were incubated with an HRP-conjugated
rabbit anti-mouse monoclonal secondary antibody at a dilution of 1:200
at 25 °C for 30 min. Finally, the chromogenic reaction was performed
using the DAB Kit (Zhongshan Jinqiao, ZLI-9017, China). Images were
visualized and captured by a microscope (Nikon Eclipse, Japan) at
10× and 20× magnification.

Immunofluorescence
Approximately 1 × 105 HT29 cells were plated on coverslips
and added to 80 μM biotin-labeled
peptide. After a 4 h incubation at 37 °C, the coverslips were
washed with PBST five times, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, incubated
with PBS containing 0.25% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany), and
blocked with 5% BSA for half an hour. Antibody incubation was performed
with anti-integrin α6 antibody (Abcam, ab181551) at a dilution
of 1:1000 overnight at 4 °C. To detect the fluorescence, the
samples were incubated with both streptavidin-Cy3 (Thermo Fisher 434315,
USA) and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 secondary antibody (Abcam,
ab150113) at a dilution of 1:1000 in 1% BSA for 1 h at room temperature
in the dark. The samples were incubated with 1 μg/mL DAPI, and
the coverslips were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade (Invitrogen
P26930, USA). Fluorescence images were visualized and captured by
a confocal microscopy confocal laser-scanning system (Olympus FV1000,
Japan) at 40× and 100× magnification. Colocalization was
analyzed with ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and the colocalization finder plug-in.

Data Analysis and Statistics
Statistical analyses were
performed using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, USA). All data were
presented as the mean ± SD. The P-values were
tested for significance using the two-sided Student t-test. P-values less than 0.05 were considered to
be statistically significant (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01).
