Cytotoxicity screenings
have identified Plectranthus plants as potential
sources of antitumor lead compounds. In this
work, several extracts from Plectranthus madagascariensis were prepared using different solvents (acetone, methanol, and supercritical
CO2) and extraction techniques (maceration, ultrasound-assisted,
and supercritical fluid extraction), and their chemical composition
was detailed using high-performance liquid chromatography with a diode
array detector. The cytotoxic activity of the major compounds identified,
namely, rosmarinic acid (1) and abietane diterpenes 7α,6β-dihydroxyroyleanone
(2), 7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (3), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4), and coleon U (5), was evaluated in a battery of human
cancer cell lines, including breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7), colon (HCT116),
and lung (NCI-H460, NCI-H460/R) cancer, and also in healthy lung (MCR-5)
cells. Royleanone (3) was isolated for the first time
from P. madagascariensis, and its full
spectroscopic characterization (proton and carbon nuclear magnetic
resonance) was accomplished. A high selectivity for lung cancer cells
was observed for royleanones (2, 4) with
selectivity indexes of 4.3 and 3.2, respectively. The observed results
combined with literature data allowed the establishment of important
structure–activity relationships for substituted royleanone
abietanes, such as the requirement for an electron-donating group
at positions 6 and/or 7 in the abietane skeleton, and an improved
cytotoxic effect for substituents with log P values
between 2 and 5.

==== Body
Introduction
Plectranthus species have been traditionally used
for a wide range of complaints,1 mainly
of the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, nervous system,
skin disorders, infections, pain, and different types of cancer due
to their medicinal properties, which include antimicrobial,2−5 antioxidant,3,6 anti-inflammatory,7,8 and cytotoxic7−11 activities. Several cytotoxic activity studies have been performed
on Plectranthus spp. Cytotoxicity screening of South
African medicinal plants traditionally used in the treatment or prevention
of cancer12 revealed that the extracts
of Plectranthus ciliatus and Plectranthus barbatus inhibited the growth of both
sensitive CCRF-CEM and multidrug-resistant CEM/ADR5000 leukemia cells.
Similarly, in another in vitro screening using the RBL-2H3 cell line,8P. ciliatus showed
higher cytotoxicity among the acetone extracts of the seven Plectranthus species tested.

The organic extracts
of Plectranthus amboinicus also exhibit
relevant cytotoxicity. The ethyl acetate extract inhibited
the growth of breast cancer MCF-7 cells,13 whereas the ethanol extract suppressed growth and induced apoptosis
in the human lung cancer A549 cell line.14 Moreover, the hydroalcoholic extract from leaves of P. amboinicus showed interesting in vivo antitumor
effects.7 On the other hand, the ethanol
extract from aerial parts of Plectranthus neochilus has shown cytotoxic effects in the Artemia salina model,15 and more recently, a hexane
extract showed growth inhibitory effects in cell carcinoma cell lines.16

The promising results from the screening
of Plectranthus extracts followed by the bio-guided
isolation of the active compounds
led to the elucidation of some promising anticancer lead compounds,
namely, labdane and abietane diterpenes. The labdane diterpene forskolin,
isolated from the roots of P. barbatus, was one of the first compounds isolated from Plectranthus species with promising anticancer activity.17 Furthermore, forskolin was shown to be a potent inhibitor of the
growth of colon cancer cells with induction of cycle arrest at the
G1 phase and further apoptosis.18

Abietane diterpenes of the royleanone and coleon type commonly
found in the Plectranthus genus, as well as other
abietanoid quinone methides, such as Parvifloron D isolated from Plectranthus ecklonii,9 have been described as potent antiproliferative and/or cytotoxic
agents.9−11,19−21

Previous cytotoxicity activity screening performed by our
group
from Plectranthus madagascariensis, P. neochilus, and Plectranthus porcatus revealed promising cytotoxic activity of the P. madagascariensis extract obtained by maceration in acetone and in the MDA-MB-231
breast cancer cell line,24 encouraging
further research. In this study, the chemical composition of several P. madagascariensis extracts obtained using different
organic solvents and extraction methodologies was detailed using high-performance
liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) and complementary
spectroscopic methodologies, and the major compounds were identified
and quantified. The cytotoxic effects of the pure compounds were evaluated
in human breast, lung, and colon cancer cell lines, and relevant structure–activity
relationships were disclosed for the royleanone-type abietane diterpenes.

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of P. madagascariensis Extracts
Several extracts from P. madagascariensis have been prepared using different solvents (acetone, methanol,
and supercritical CO2) and extraction techniques (maceration,
ultrasound-assisted, and supercritical fluid extraction), resulting
in different extractive yields (Table 1).

The component yield is express in mg of component per g of plant dry

Higher extractive
yields were obtained using methanol as the solvent,
which can be due to the ability of alcohol to disrupt the plant cell
wall favoring the diffusion of secondary metabolites to the bulk extract.
Moreover, considering the relative polarity of the extraction solvents
in terms of dielectric constant (ε), a trend was observed for
the more polar solvents to achieve higher extraction yields (εmethanol > εacetone ≫ εscCO2). The supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE)
method
using scCO2 was the least efficient extraction process
with the lower yield. Because of this low extraction efficiency, a
re-extraction of the remaining plant material with acetone was performed
to extract the remaining secondary metabolites, which resulted in
a higher extraction yield (E6, Table 1) when compared to SCFE alone.

HPLC-DAD Extract Profiling
The identification and quantification
of major compounds (rosmarinic acid (1), 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone
(2), 7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (3), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4), and coleon U (5); Figure 1) in P. madagascariensis extracts were performed using HPLC-DAD and complementary spectroscopic
methodologies.

Figure 1 Chemical structure of the major components in P.
madagascariensis extracts: rosmarinic acid (1), 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone (2),
7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (3), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone
(4), and coleon U (5).

Previous phytochemistry studies on the Plectranthus genus revealed the presence of polyphenols and diterpenes as the
most frequent secondary metabolites.3,6,32 These compounds have characteristic absorption patterns
in the UV spectral region due to the presence of conjugated carbonyl
groups (270 nm), aromatic rings (280 nm), and phenolic groups (330
nm); thus, analytical measurements were performed at these three wavelengths.
HPLC representative chromatograms of P. madagascariensis extracts are available at the Supporting Information (Figure S1). For each extract, the major peaks
were identified by comparing the retention time and UV–vis
spectrum overlay (Figure S2, Supporting
Information) by co-elution with pure standards. The peak eluted at
10.47 min, which was present in all extracts, was positively identified
as rosmarinic acid (1, Figure 1) after co-elution with a commercial standard
(Figure S2, Supporting Information). This
polyphenol, found in several Plectranthus species,
had been previously identified in P. madagascariensis.5,33

The peaks obtained at the average retention
times of 17.80, 19.40,
and 19.80 min possessed the typical royleanone-type abietane UV spectra25 (Figure S1, Supporting
Information) with an absorption maximum at 272 nm and a secondary
broad maximum between 300 and 500 nm, in accordance with other phytochemical
studies of Plectranthus species.32 The peaks at 17.80 and 19.80 min were identified as 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone
(2, Figure 1) and 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4, Figure 1), respectively,
after co-elution of the extracts with authentic samples previously
obtained from Plectranthus spp.2 The peak at 19.40 min was identified as 7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone
(3, Figure 1), isolated from the acetone extract prepared by UAE, after co-elution
with the purified compound. A major peak eluted at 21.08 min showing
a UV spectrum (Figure S1, Supporting Information)
comparable to that of coleon U (5, Figure 1),23 a diterpene
often found in Plectranthus species, which was confirmed
after co-elution of the extracts with an authentic sample.2 This compound was reported to have some intrinsic
instability, being easily converted to an oxidized form, coleon U-quinone
(6, Figure 2).23,25 This degradation product was also detected
in some P. madagascariensis extracts
as a trace at a retention time of 19.19 min. The periodic analysis
of an authentic sample of (5) revealed the gradual increase
of the peak at 19.19 min and concomitant reduction of the peak at
21.08 min, which represents a gradual conversion of the compound (5) into its oxidized form (6, Figure 2).

Isolation and Spectroscopic
Structure Elucidation of 7α-Formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone
(3)
The compound (3) was isolated
from the acetone extract of P. madagascariensis (480 mg of dried residue) prepared by UAE following column chromatography
using hexane/ethyl acetate 95:5 (v/v) as an eluent and purified using
preparative chromatography through repeated elution with hexane/ethyl
acetate 75:25 (v/v), yielding 6.1 mg (1.27% (w/w) yield) of yellow
needles after recrystallization from methanol. The compound was fully
characterized using NMR spectroscopy (1H and 13C NMR spectra available in the Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4, respectively).

The 1H NMR spectrum of (3) (Figure S3, Supporting Information) was very similar to that of royleanone
(4).29 The main differences
were due to the absence of the singlet signal at δ 2.02 ppm
corresponding to the methyl protons of the acetoxyl group at C7 in
(4) and the presence of a distinct doublet at δ
8.05 ppm (J = 1.2 Hz), which might correspond to
an acidic proton from a secondary formyloxyl group.30 This observation suggested the substitution of the 7α-acetoxyl
group of (4) by 7α-formyloxyl in (3), which was confirmed by the literature30 and extensive NMR studies (1H and 13C NMR,
COSY, HMBC, and HMQC; Table 2). Thus, the compound (3) was identified as 7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone,
which has been previously isolated from Plectranthus
hadiensis(31) and Plectranthus myrianthus.25 To our knowledge, this was the first isolation of (3) from P. madagascariensis and its
first full 13C NMR characterization.

Kubínová et
al.5 have
studied the methanol extract of P. madagascariensis, which resulted in the identification of rosmarinic acid (1), 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone (2),
7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4), and
coleon U-quinone (6) as the major components of this
extract. However, the full spectroscopic elucidation of these compounds
was not accomplished by the authors.

The quantification of the
major compounds in P.
madagascariensis extracts was also performed based
on the validated calibration curves for main polyphenol rosmarinic
acid (1) and main abietane diterpenes 6β,7α-dihydroxyroyleanone
(2), 7α-formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (3), 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4), and coleon U (5). Linear responses and high sensitivity
were obtained for all compounds (Table S1, Supporting Information). The component yield in each extract has
been listed in Table 1.

7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4) obtained
from Plectranthus grandidentatus is
described to show strong in vitro antiproliferative activity against
several human cancer cell lines,11 whereas
taxodione from P. barbatus and their
semisynthetic derivatives were highly cytotoxic toward human leukemia
cells.19 Growth inhibition triggered by
these compounds was caused by induction of apoptosis, whereas cell
death was associated with the release of mitochondrial proteins due
to mitochondrial membrane depolarization.19 Additionally, 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4) was identified as the main compound that contributed to
the cytotoxic activity of the chloroform extract of P. amboinicus against breast cancer MCF-7 cells,
using an HPLC-based metabolomics approach.22

Rosmarinic acid (1) was the most abundant secondary
metabolite present in all extracts, with yields ranging from 4.60
to 50.5 mg/g (Table 1). This finding is in agreement with the described abundance of this
polyphenol in other Plectranthus species.6,32 Coleon U (5) was diterpene quantified in higher yields,
although high yields of royleanone-type diterpenes (2–4) were also found in all extracts, particularly
in the acetone ones (E1 and E2, Table 1).

Coleon U has been isolated from several Plectranthus species, such as Plectranthus
forsteri,23P. grandidentatus,10,11P. madagascariensis24 and P. myrianthus,25 exhibits
potent cytotoxic effects
transversal to several human cancer cell lines, including breast,11,19 lung,11 leukemia,10,19,26 and melanoma.11,19 Moreover,
coleon U has been described as a potent and selective activator of
the proapoptotic protein kinases C-δ (PKCδ) and C-ε
(PKCε), which can be on the basis of its reported antitumor
action.27,28 However, coleon U is easily degraded to
its oxidized form, coleon U-quinone. This metabolite has been isolated
from Plectranthus xanthanthus along
with coleon U 11-acetate, and both showed cytotoxic effects.23,26

Cytotoxicity Evaluation
The cytotoxic effects of P. madagascariensis extracts have been previously
evaluated in the MDA-MB-231 cancer cell line by our group,24 and the isolated abietane diterpenes most likely
contribute to the cytotoxicity of P. madagascariensis extracts. The extract obtained by maceration with acetone (E2),
which had the highest combinatory yield of royleanone abietanes (Table 1), was the most cytotoxic.24 The cytotoxic activities of the royleanone diterpenes,
that is, against breast cancer cell lines, have been previously reported.11,19 Additionally, coleon U (5) has been described in the
literature as a potent cytotoxic agent, being active against breast,11,19 leukemia,10,19,26 and melanoma11,19 cancer cell lines. However, the
acetone extract (E1) prepared by UAE and previously analyzed,24 which had the highest yield of coleon U (5) and also the highest combinatory yield of abietane diterpenes,
was not the most cytotoxic. This can be due to its higher amount of
rosmarinic acid (1) because the most cytotoxic extract
(E2) had a lower yield of this polyphenol compared to the other extracts
(Table 1). Rosmarinic
acid (1) is known to be a potent antioxidant,6 and some studies related the cytotoxic effect
of abietane diterpenes possessing conjugated quinone moieties to the
induction of radical reactions,20,21 which may anticipate
a potential antagonistic effect between antioxidant polyphenols and
conjugated quinone diterpenes.

The cytotoxic activity of isolated
compounds (1–5) from P. madagascariensis extracts was assayed in breast
cancer (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7), colon cancer (HCT116), non-small cell
lung cancer (NCI-H460), and normal lung bronchial (MCR-5) cell lines
(Table 3). Interestingly,
in the MCF-7 cell line, the structural modifications carried out in
compounds (3–5) significantly increased
their antiproliferative effects when compared to that in the compound 2 (Table 3).
All abietane diterpenes revealed growth inhibitory effects in most
of the cancer cell lines tested. Moreover, royleanones (2, 4) exhibited high selectivity based on the comparison
of GI50 for cancer (NCI-H460) and normal lung (MCR-5) cell
lines. These royleanones also showed similar growth inhibition of
the NCI-H460 cancer cell line and its multidrug-resistant variant
(NCI-H460/R), which overexpress the multidrug resistance protein 1
(MDR1 or P-glycoprotein),34 suggesting
that compounds (2, 4) are not substrates
for such efflux pumps.

On the one
hand, the growth of MDA-MB-231 cancer cells was not
particularly affected by abietane diterpenes. This cell line is a
highly metastatic triple negative breast cancer cell line that does
not display estrogenic receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR),
or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), thus being clinically
difficult to target.35 The ER negative
cells are known to have a higher expression of PKC classic isoforms
when compared to ER positive cell lines.36 The upregulation of the classic isoform PKCα promotes the
invasiveness and metastasis formation36 along with increased drug resistance37 in breast cancers. On the other hand, the PKCδ activation
supports both prosurvival38 and proapoptotic39 functions in breast cancer cells. Some abietane
diterpenes such as coleon U (5) have also been shown
to exert proapoptotic effects by the specific activation of PKC-δ
and PKC-ε.27,28 Therefore, in the MDA-MB-231
cell line characterized by an overexpression of classic PKC isoforms
in detriment of new PKC isoforms, the preferential mechanism of apoptosis
induction by coleon U (and eventually by other abietane diterpenes)
through activation of PKC-δ and PKC-ε should be less effective,
which can explain the lower growth inhibition of this cell line by
these compounds.

Some relationships between the PKC overexpression
and the drug
resistance by MDR1 have been reported. A cellular increase of the
MDR1 expression was verified following the treatment with the PKC
activator TPA, which was suppressed by the use of a PKC inhibitor
(staurosporine).40 Furthermore, the use
of the PKC inhibitor, bryostatin 1, potentiated the cytotoxic effects
of anticancer drugs transported by efflux pumps, such as vincristine,
by the reduction of MDR1 expression.41 Those
findings can be especially relevant in the case of abietane diterpenes
being not transported by MDR1 for which the PKC activation and the
secondary MDR1 overexpression should not increase the cell resistance
to such compounds.

Structure–Activity Relationships
The obtained
data on abietane diterpene cytotoxicity (Table 3) combined with other studies on the cytotoxicity
of this class of compounds (Table 4) allowed the establishment of some structure–activity
relationships (SARs) for royleanone-type abietanes. The main difference
between royleanones (2) and (4) resides
on the polarity of the substituent at 7α (Figure 1). In this series, a clear tendency was observed
for increasing cytotoxicity with the higher lipophilicity of the 7α
substituent. The same tendency was observed between horminone (Figure 3, R1 =
H, R2 = R3 = OH) and its more cytotoxic 7α-acetoxy
derivative (Figure 3, R1 = H, R2 = OCOCH3, R3 = OH).42,43 Whether these structural alterations corresponded
to an improved fitting on the target or if the cytotoxic activity
was instigated by favorable log P for membrane crossing
remains to be answered because the cytotoxicity of several diterpenes
has been associated with a mechanism involving membrane-disrupting
properties.3,44

On the basis of the extensive literature
reporting the cytotoxicity
on royleanone-type compounds bearing a p-benzoquinone
moiety in the ring C (Figure 3), additional tendencies could be explored (Table 4).

Burmistrova et al.19 studied the cytotoxic
effects for a series of derivatives of 7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone
(4). The overall compounds affect the cell proliferation
with an apparently cell-type dependent intensity. By displaying such
compounds by their log P value, a strong tendency
for higher cytotoxic effects was observed for log P values between 2 and 5.5. Because the “Lipinski rule of five”
establishes that log P for an oral bioavailable compound
should be under 5, the useful compounds must be considered in the
2–5 range of log P.45 The only exception for this trend was royleanone (Figure 3, R1 = R2 = H, R3 = OH) that showed only slight cytotoxic effects
in some cell lines.19,42,46 This could indicate that the presence of a lipophilic substituent
was required at positions 6 and/or 7 for the cytotoxic effects to
take place. However, the 6,7-dehydro derivative (Figure 3, R1 = R2 = HΔ,6,7 R3 = OH) has shown
some potent cell-type specific cytotoxic effects.47−49 Thus, the presence
of an electron-donating group at position 6 or 7 seems to be essential
for cytotoxic activity.

The cytotoxicity of the studied abietane
diterpenes against most
of the cancer cell lines tested and the selectivity of the royleanone-type
compounds, particularly for non-small lung cancer cells and their
multidrug-resistant variant, encourage further studies using this
scaffold to develop analogues with potential application as chemopreventive,
chemoadjuvant, or chemotherapeutic agents.

Experimental Section
General
Experimental Procedures
Chemical reagents and
standards were from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Authentic
samples of 7α,6β-dihydroxyroyleanone (2),
7α-acetoxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone (4), and
coleon U (5) were obtained from Gaspar-Marques.2 Solvents of either analytical or HPLC grade were
from Merck. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was from Gibco, penicillin–streptomycin
for the cell culture and an RPMI 1640 culture medium with ultraglutamine
were from Lonza, and Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
(DMEM) was from Biowest. Analytical TLC and preparative TLC were performed
on precoated silica gel plates from Merck (Kieselgel 60 F254, 0.2
and 0.5 mm). For column chromatography, silica gel 60 (0.063–0.200
mm) from Merck was used. NMR spectra were recorded on a Varian INOVA-400
spectrometer (Varian, Palo Alto, CA, USA) equipped with a 5 mm inverse
detection z-gradient probe. The 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were acquired at 400 and 100 MHz, respectively, using CDCl3 as the solvent, and the chemical shifts were reported in
parts per million referring to the residual CHCl3 signal
(δH 7.26 for proton and δC 77.0
for carbon).

Cell Cultures
The human cell lines
MDA-MB-231 (metastatic
breast cancer), MCF-7 (estrogen-dependent breast carcinoma), HCT116
(colorectal carcinoma), NCI-H460 (non-small cell lung carcinoma),
and MCR-5 (normal human embryonal bronchial epithelial cells) were
obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville,
MD). The multidrug-resistant non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line
(NCI-H460/R) with P-glycoprotein overexpression was obtained from
the original NCI-H460 cell line by continuous treatment with stepwise
increasing concentrations of doxorubicin (5–100 nM) for 3 months
according to a procedure optimized by Pesic et al.34 Cell lines were routinely cultured in RPMI 1640 with ultraglutamine
or DMEM (MDA-MB-231 cells), supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin,
and 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and maintained under standard cell conditions
at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2.50,51

Plant Material
Plectranthus
madagascarensis Benth. was cultivated in Parque Botânico
da Tapada da Ajuda
(Instituto Superior Agrário, Lisbon, Portugal) from cuttings
obtained from the Kirstenbosch National Botanical Garden (Cape Town,
South Africa), and voucher specimens (841/2007) were deposited in
the Herbarium João de Carvalho e Vasconcellos (Instituto Superior
Agrário, Lisbon, Portugal). The whole plant material was collected
in 2007, dried at room temperature, and stored protected from light
and humidity.

Extract Preparation
The dried plant
was ground to small
pieces, pulverized, and extracted with acetone or methanol by maceration
(ME) or ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and also by supercritical
fluid extraction (SCFE) with supercritical CO2 (scCO2). Each crude extract was separated from the remaining plant
material by paper filtration, and the organic solvents were evaporated
in a rotary evaporator below 40 °C. Each dried extract was weighted
and stored at −20 °C until further use.

The organic
extracts were prepared by maceration (ME) or ultrasound-assisted (UAE)
extraction by adding the plant material (10 g) to 200 mL of organic
solvent (acetone or methanol) kept stirring for 24 h (ME) or sonicated
in an ultrasonic bath at 35 kHz for 2 h (UAE). Alternatively, supercritical
fluid extraction (SCFE) was also performed by packing the plant material
(30 g) into a 278 cm3 inox cell and injecting scCO2 during 3 h at a flow rate of 0.3 kg/h under a pressure of
230 bar and a temperature of 40 °C.52 The remaining plant material resulting from SCFE was recovered,
air dried, and re-extracted (R-SCFE) by addition to 200 mL of acetone
kept stirring for 24 h at room temperature.

Extraction and Purification
of 7α-Formyloxy-6β-hydroxyroyleanone
(3)
Ultrasound-assisted extraction of P. madagascariensis by sonication of 100 g of plant
material in 2 L of acetone for 2 h yielded 480 mg of dried residue
(0.48% (w/w) extraction yield) after evaporation of the organic solvent.
The extract was treated with activated charcoal to eliminate the high
content in chlorophyll plant pigments and fractionated by chromatography
on a silica gel (30 g) column eluted with a gradient of ethyl acetate
in hexane. The compound (3) was recovered from the fraction
eluted with hexane/ethyl acetate 95:5 (v/v) and purified by preparative
chromatography through repeated elution with hexane/ethyl acetate
75:25 (v/v) followed by recrystallization from methanol, yielding
6.1 mg (1.27% (w/w) yield) of yellow needles. Spectroscopic characterization
was performed by one-dimensional (1H and 13C
NMR) and two-dimensional (COSY, HMBC, and HSQC) NMR (Table 2 and Figures S3 and S4, Supporting Information).

HPLC-DAD Fingerprinting
The extract profiling was performed
with an Agilent Technologies 1200 Infinity Series LC system (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to a diode array detector
(DAD) and processed using the ChemStation software. Four detection
wavelengths were selected: 254, 270, 280, and 330 nm. A 20 μL
sample was injected into a reverse phase LiChrospher 100 RP-18 5 μm
(4.0 × 250 mm) column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and eluted
with a gradient composed of methanol (A), acetonitrile (B), and 0.3%
(w/v) trichloroacetic acid in ultrapure water (C) as follows: 0 min,
15% A, 5% B, and 80% C; 20 min, 70% A, 30% B, and 0% C; 25 min, 70%
A, 30% B, and 0% C; and 28 min, 15% A, 5% B, and 80% C. The flow rate
was set at 1 mL/min at room temperature. Solvents were previously
filtered and degassed through a 0.22 μm membrane filter. All
analysis was performed in triplicate, and the results are presented
as mean ± SD.

The major peaks from each extract sample
were identified by comparing the retention time and UV–vis
spectrum overlay with commercial standards (rosmarinic acid) or authentic
standards previously obtained from Plectranthus spp.2 The calibration curves were constructed as a
linear regression of the analyte concentration (mM) against the average
peak area. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification
(LOQ) were determined to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis
corresponding to the concentrations of the analyte that resulted in
signal-to-noise ratios of 3 (LOD) and 10 (LOQ) following the guidelines
from ICH Q2(R1) on validation of analytical procedures.53 The LOD and LOQ were calculated as LOD = 3.3σ/S and LOQ = 10σ/S, where σ
corresponds to the standard deviation of the response and S corresponds to the slope of the calibration curve, which
was estimated from the calibration curve of the analyte (Table S1, Supporting Information).

Cytotoxicity
Assays
The cytotoxicity of compounds (1–5) obtained from P. madagascariensis extracts was evaluated in a battery of human cell lines (MDA-MB-231,
MCF-7, and HCT116) using the sulfurhodamine B (SRB) assay according
to a procedure supervised by Saraiva et al.54,55 Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates (5.0 × 103 cells/well) and incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in a humidified
atmosphere with 5% CO2. Then, cells were exposed to serial
dilutions of each compound (1.85–150 μM) and incubated
for another 48 h. Following fixation with 10% trichloroacetic acid,
cells were stained with 0.4% (w/v) sulforhodamine B and then washed
with 1% acetic acid to remove the unbound stain. The adsorbed dye
was dissolved with 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 10.5), and the absorbance
was measured at 510 nm in a microplate reader (Biotek Instruments
Inc., Synergy MX, USA). Doxorubicin was used as positive control.
In Table 3, Student’s t test was used to compare the GI50 values of
compounds (3–5) to that of compound 2 in the MCF-7 cell line. All P values were
based on the two-sided statistical analysis, and P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

The cytotoxic effects of the compounds toward NCI-H460, NCI-H460/R,
and MCR-5 cell lines were further assessed by the MTT colorimetric
assay based on the reduction of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) into a formazan dye by active mitochondria
of living cells according to the procedure described by Pesic et al.34,56 Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates, inoculated with the
compounds (2.5–50 μM), and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Then, 100 μL
of MTT solution (1 mg/mL) was added to each well, and the plates were
incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. The formazan product was dissolved
by adding 200 μL of DMSO per well, and absorbance was measured
at 540 nm in a microplate reader (LKB 5060–006 Micro Plate
Reader, Vienna, Austria). Paclitaxel was used as positive control.

Cell viability (%) was calculated as a fraction of the absorbance
shown by nontreated cells (control), and the GI50 values,
corresponding to the concentration of the compound that inhibits 50%
of cell growth, were determined. At least two independent experiments
in triplicate were performed for each test compound. Statistical analysis
was performed using GraphPad Prism 6.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., La
Jolla, CA, USA). Results are presented as mean ± SD. Normality
was checked by Column Statistics of GraphPad Prism 6 software—Shapiro–Wilk
normality test. Accordingly, the unpaired t test
from row data after the MTT measurement was applied.
