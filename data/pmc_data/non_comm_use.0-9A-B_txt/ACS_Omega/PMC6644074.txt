The
large-scale enrichment of metallic carbon nanotubes is a challenging
goal that has proven elusive. Selective dispersion of carbon nanotubes
by specifically designed conjugated polymers is effective for isolating
semiconducting species, but a comparable system does not exist for
isolating metallic species. Here, we report a two-polymer system where
semiconducting species are extracted from the raw HiPCO or plasma-torch
nanotube starting material using an electron-rich poly(fluorene-co-carbazole) derivative, followed by isolation of the metallic
species remaining in the residue using an electron-poor methylated
poly(fluorene-co-pyridine) polymer. Characterization
of the electronic nature of extracted samples was carried out via
a combination of absorption, Raman, and fluorescence spectroscopy,
as well as electrical conductivity measurements. Using this methodology,
the metallic species in the sample were enriched 2-fold in comparison
to the raw starting material. These results indicate that the use
of electron-poor polymers is an effective strategy for the enrichment
of metallic species.

Introduction
Due to their excellent
physical1−3 and optoelectronic properties,4−7 single-walled carbon nanotubes
(SWNTs) have received significant
attention from the scientific community. Depending on the specific
nanotube structure, the SWNTs can be semiconducting (sc-SWNT) or metallic
(m-SWNT) in nature.8 SWNTs have been incorporated into a myriad
of applications, including field-effect transistors,9 sensors,10−14 high-strength nanocomposites,15−17 photodetectors,18 organic photovoltaics,19,20 touch screens,21 flexible electronics,22−24 light-weight
conductive wiring,25 and conductive inks,26,27 among numerous others.28,29 Many of these applications
require enriched samples of m- or sc-SWNTs. However, the SWNT samples
produced using commercially viable methods, which include high-pressure
carbon monoxide disproportionation (HiPCO),30 chemical vapor deposition,31,32 laser ablation,33 arc-discharge,34 and
plasma-torch growth,35 all produce heterogeneous
mixtures. Typical as-produced SWNT samples contain approximately one-third
m-SWNTs and two-thirds sc-SWNTs.8 This
complicated mixture of SWNT species generally precludes immediate
device incorporation; for instance, pure sc-SWNT samples are imperative
for field-effect transistors,9 as m-SWNTs
will short-circuit the device.

To address purification issues,
several methods have been developed,
including density gradient ultracentrifugation,36,37 agarose gel filtration,38,39 electrophoresis,40 two-phase extraction,41,42 and size-exclusion chromatography.43,44 Although these
methods are capable of separating individual SWNT species, scalability
is limited, which is reflected in the still exorbitant costs for enriched
m-SWNT samples (>99% purity) from commercial suppliers ($899 USD/mg,
Raymor Industries Inc., August 2018). A promising alternative and
scalable method is conjugated polymer sorting.45,46 This method employs the structural tuning of conjugated polymers
(side chain, polymer backbone, molecular weight, etc.) to produce
polymer–SWNT dispersions enriched with specific SWNT subtypes.
The discrimination mechanism, although not yet clear, occurs during
the polymer–SWNT sonication step (selective polymer–SWNT
interactions) and/or during the centrifugation step (selective SWNT
removal). The molecular properties of conjugated polymers can be precisely
tuned, and the scaffolds of polyfluorene,47−51 polycarbazole,52−54 polythiophene,55−58 and others59−61 have been used
to produce enriched sc-SWNT samples. Despite this progress, the selective
dispersion of m-SWNTs using conjugated polymers remains elusive.

Previously, we have explored the effect of polymer backbone electron
density on SWNT dispersion selectivity.62−64 We prepared a series
of homologous structures and varied only the electron-donating or
-withdrawing nature of the pendant substituents. We have observed
that under the same dispersion preparation conditions, “electron-rich”
conjugated polymers produced enriched sc-SWNT dispersions, whereas
relatively electron-poor conjugated polymers produced dispersions
with increased amounts of m-SWNTs. In addition to this work, our group
has recently shown that the initial ratio of m-/sc-SWNTs can influence
the dispersion outcome.65 Intriguingly,
poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene-2,7-diyl), despite its known selectively
for sc-SWNTs,48 was able to disperse m-SWNTs
when the m-/sc-SWNT ratio was increased to 3:1. We thus surmised that
altering the initial m-/sc-SWNT ratio may enable improved discrimination
for m-SWNTs in conjunction with our electron-rich/electron-poor paradigm.

As mentioned above, commercial SWNT samples are relatively homogeneous
in their initial proportion of 1:2 m-/sc-SWNTs. Thus, modification
of the initial m-/sc-SWNT ratio must be accomplished during the purification
process. In a study by Malenfant and co-workers, polyfluorene derivatives
were used to discriminate for sc-SWNTs, and then the undispersed SWNT
residue was recycled several times to extract as many sc-SWNTs as
possible.66 Conceivably, a conjugated polymer
that produces concentrated and enriched sc-SWNT dispersions could
be used to bias the initial m-/sc-SWNT ratio toward m-SWNTs, and then
a second polymer dispersant can be used to disperse the residual m-SWNTs.
In this work, we perform a series of sc-SWNT extractions using an
electron-rich conjugated polymer and then disperse the resulting m-SWNT-enriched
residue using a relatively electron-poor conjugated polymer. We find
that the amount of dispersed m-SWNTs is improved through the combination
of initial sc-SWNT removal followed by use of an electron-poor conjugated
polymer as the final dispersant.

Results and Discussion
To begin our investigation, we first prepared an electron-rich
carbazole-co-fluorene conjugated polymer and an electron-poor
methylated fluorene-co-pyridine copolymer. The carbazole
monomer was prepared from commercially available 4,4′-dibromobiphenyl
via nitration and Cadogan ring closure to form the carbazole nucleus,
followed by phase-transfer alkylation to install the branched solubilizing
alkyl side chain (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S1). The complementary fluorene monomer was synthesized
from commercially available fluorene via bromination with N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), phase-transfer alkylation with
1-bromododecane, and boronate esterification with bis(pinacolato)diboron
using Miyaura conditions (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S2).67 We then
polymerized the carbazole and fluorene monomers via Suzuki polycondensation
to afford P1 (see the Supporting Information, Scheme S3). Next, polymerization using the fluorene
monomer and commercially available 2,5-dibromopyridine generated poly(fluorene-co-pyridine) PF–Py, which
could be methylated with iodomethane to produce P2.64 GPC analysis showed that P1 had
a number-average molecular weight (Mn)
of 46.3 kDa, corresponding to a degree of polymerization (DP) of ∼46,
and a dispersity (Đ) of 1.99, and that P2 had an Mn of 13.5 kDa, corresponding
to a DP of ∼23, and a Đ of 1.84. The
absorption and emission data for polymers P1 and P2 are provided in the Supporting Information.

With our polymers in hand, supramolecular complexes between P1 and raw HiPCO SWNTs (tube diameter 0.8–1.2 nm)45 were prepared following literature procedures.68 During initial studies, we evaluated different
dispersion solvents and polymer-to-nanotube mass ratios (Figure S17). It was determined that optimal mass
ratios for P1/SWNT and P2/SWNT were 1.5:1
and 1:1, respectively, which provided highly concentrated dispersions
in tetrahydrofuran (THF) while consuming minimal amounts of polymer.
Briefly, 5 mg of raw SWNTs were added to a solution of 7.5 mg of P1 dissolved in 10 mL of THF. The sample was sonicated for
2 h in an ice-chilled bath sonicator, followed by centrifugation at
8346g for 30 min. The supernatant was carefully removed,
filtered through a Teflon membrane with 0.2 μm pore diameter,
and thoroughly rinsed with THF until the filtrate did not fluoresce
when excited with a hand-held UV lamp at 365 nm. The polymer–SWNT
thin film was then redispersed in 10 mL of THF using an ice-chilled
bath sonicator for 30 min. Meanwhile, the residue in the centrifugation
tube was sonicated in 10 mL of THF for 10 min and then filtered through
a 0.2 μm pore diameter Teflon membrane to remove unbound polymer.
As shown in Figure 1, the residue could then be redispersed using either 7.5 mg of P1 (to further extract sc-SWNTs) or 5 mg of P2 (to disperse m-SWNTs). For this study, we use “ExPy” nomenclature, where x indicates the number of extractions (0–4) and y indicates the polymer used to redisperse the residue (1 or 2). Using
this process, we produced nine polymer–SWNT dispersions, which
were evaluated for sc- and m-SWNT content based on the number of extractions
and the final polymer dispersant.

Figure 1 Cartoon representation of the extraction
process. The nomenclature
used is ExPy, where x is the extraction number (0–4) and y is
the polymer used to redisperse the pellet (1 or 2). The chemical structures
of electron-rich P1 (blue) and relatively electron-poor P2 (red) are shown.

To characterize the resulting polymer–SWNT complexes,
we
first performed UV–vis–near-infrared (NIR) absorption
spectroscopy. The absorption peaks observed arise from the different
SWNT species present within each polymer–SWNT dispersion. For
HiPCO SWNTs, there are three different regions: two semiconducting
regions, S11 (830–1600 nm) and S22 (600–800
nm), and one metallic region, M11 (440–645 nm).69 The absorption spectra were normalized to the
local minimum at ∼905 nm to highlight the differences in m-
and sc-SWNT content for each dispersion. Un-normalized spectra are
provided in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). Preliminary studies were performed to ensure that our
polymers do not equally disperse sc- and m-SWNTs (details in the Supporting Information). Three dispersions, including
a P1–SWNT, P2–SWNT, and a
dispersion using SDBS surfactant, were formulated. SDBS is well known
to indiscriminately disperse SWNTs, irrespective of their electronic
nature. The P1–SWNT and P2–SWNT
dispersions possess lesser and greater M11 absorption features,
respectively, compared to that of the SDBS–SWNT dispersion
(Figure S16), suggesting that P1 shows a degree of selectivity for sc-SWNT dispersions and P2 for m-SWNT dispersions. As shown in Figure 2A, the intensity of the M11 region
increases after each extraction step in the P1–SWNT
dispersion series. This suggests that sc-SWNT discrimination is diminished
as the m-/sc-SWNT ratio is biased toward m-SWNTs, or as the polymer/SWNT
mass ratio increases because the total amount of SWNTs decreases with
each extraction. Similarly, the intensity of the M11 region
also increases for the P2–SWNT dispersion series
as a function of extraction count (Figure 2B). Intriguingly, the electron-poor P2 disperses more m-SWNTs than the electron-rich P1, as evidenced by the M11 peak intensities when juxtaposing
the absorption spectra of polymer–SWNT dispersions at the same
extraction number (Figure 2C,D). This trend was consistent over all extractions (Supporting
Information, Figure S2), revealing that
the use of an electron-poor conjugated polymer is beneficial in dispersing
significant amounts of m-SWNTs, especially when compared to using
only P1 as both the sc-SWNT extraction agent and as the
final m-SWNT dispersant. The color of the polymer–SWNT dispersions
corroborates our analysis. For HiPCO samples, a green color was observed
for the P1–SWNT dispersions, indicating sc-SWNT
enrichment, whereas a red color was observed for the P2–SWNT dispersions, indicating m-SWNT enrichment (Figure S3).

extraction study using HiPCO SWNTs. Polymer–SWNT dispersions

dispersions after (C) 0 extractions and (D) 3 extractions are shown.
The spectra are normalized to the local minimum at ∼905 nm
to show a relative m-SWNT and sc-SWNT content.

To further probe the electronic nature of the nine polymer–SWNT
dispersions produced, resonance Raman spectroscopy was performed.
This technique allows for the examination of both m- and sc-SWNT species
within a given sample70 and utilizes laser
excitation wavelengths that overlap with the van Hove singularities
present in the one-dimensional density of states for a particular
SWNT type.71 As the electronic transitions
depend on nanotube species and diameter, only a subset of the total
nanotube population will be observed for each individual excitation
wavelength, necessitating the use of multiple excitation wavelengths
for complete characterization.72 Thin films
of our polymer–SWNT dispersions were prepared by drop-casting
the dispersion onto silicon wafers, followed by evaporation at RT.
A reference SWNT sample was prepared by briefly sonicating the raw
starting material in chloroform and using this suspension to prepare
a sample using the same drop-casting method. For HiPCO SWNTs, three
laser excitation wavelengths were used: 514, 633, and 785 nm. These
wavelengths have previously been shown to adequately characterize
the HiPCO electronic character, as both sc- and m-SWNTs can be separately
probed.73Figure 3 shows the radial breathing mode (RBM) for P1–SWNT and P2–SWNT dispersions
at 633 nm. All the spectra were normalized to the G-band (at approximately
1590 cm–1) for comparative analysis. Using a 633
nm excitation wavelength, both m- (175–230 cm–1) and sc-SWNTs (240–300 cm–1) are in resonance
with HiPCO samples.74 As shown in Figure 3A, the P1–SWNT samples possess sharp peaks in the sc-SWNT region. As
the extraction number increases, the intensity of the m-SWNT region
also increases, albeit minimally. This suggests that after extracting
a critical amount of sc-SWNTs, P1 begins to disperse
small amounts of m-SWNTs. Likewise, the P2–SWNT
samples exhibit increasing propensity for dispersion of m-SWNT as
the number of extractions increase. As seen in Figure 3B, P2 disperses substantially
more m-SWNTs than P1 at the same extraction number, as
evidenced by the increased peak intensity in the m-SWNT region. This
result corroborates the conclusions of the absorption spectra (vide
supra).

Figure 3 Raman spectra of the RBM region (λex = 633 nm)
for polymer–SWNT samples after sc-SWNT extractions (0–4
times) with HiPCO SWNTs prepared using (A) P1 and (B) P2. Pink boxes represent signals arising from m-SWNTs, whereas
gray boxes represent signals arising from sc-SWNTs.

To further characterize the samples, we examined
them using an
excitation wavelength of 785 nm, which is primarily in resonance with
sc-SWNTs (175–280 cm–1). As shown in Figure S4A,B, all polymer–SWNT samples
possessed sc-SWNTs. When HiPCO SWNTs are excited at this wavelength,
an intense peak (∼265 cm–1) originating from
bundled (10, 2) SWNTs is observed.75 This
“bundling peak” allows for the evaluation of the bundling
degree in a sample. Figure S4A,B shows
that all the polymer–SWNT samples have significant bundling
peak suppression, in contrast to the raw nanotube control sample.
This suggests that both P1 and P2 efficiently
exfoliate SWNTs. Lastly, the polymer–SWNT samples were probed
at 514 nm. For sc-SWNTs, a broad peak is centered at 180 cm–1, whereas for m-SWNTs, the peaks arise between 225 and 290 cm–1.76 As shown in Figure S4C,D, m-SWNTs are present in all the
samples. However, based on the G-band analysis, it appears that the
m-SWNT signals are more intense in the P2–SWNT
samples (for full Raman spectra refer to the Supporting Information, Figure S5). The G-band consists of two peaks:
a lower-frequency G– and a higher-frequency G+. For sc-SWNTs, the G– and G+ both have Lorentzian line shapes, but for m-SWNTs, the G– exhibits a broader Breit–Wigner–Fano (BWF) line shape.77 The BWF line shape is more prominent in the P2–SWNT samples, suggesting that they possess a higher
m-SWNT content. Based on the aforementioned analysis, the P2–SWNT samples possess more m-SWNTs than P1–SWNT
samples for all extractions, although P2 cannot completely
remove all sc-SWNTs.

Photoluminescence (PL) maps of the polymer–SWNT
dispersions
were recorded and juxtaposed with the locations of sc-SWNT fluorescence
maxima, assigned using literature data.6 The dispersions for E0P1, E0P2, and E3P2 were concentration-matched
(absorption of ∼0.27 at 1135 nm) using UV–vis–NIR
spectroscopy (Supporting Information, Figure S6). The PL maps of all the extractions for P1 (Figure S7) and P2 (Figure S8) are provided in the Supporting Information. As
shown in Figure 4,
it is apparent that when intensity scales are identical, the E0P1
dispersion has the most intense fluorescence in comparison to the
other polymer–SWNT samples. When comparing E0P2 to E3P2, the
former possesses a slightly higher fluorescence intensity than the
latter. These differences in fluorescence intensity are likely due
the presence of m-SWNTs, which are known fluorescence quenchers.5 Although the Raman analysis indicates that bundles
are not dispersed to any appreciable amount in these systems, their
presence cannot be entirely ruled out. Thus, the likely source of
the observed fluorescence quenching is the presence of m-SWNTs that
are either individually wrapped with polymer or present in small bundles.
This suggests that E3P2 possesses more m-SWNTs than E0P2, and that
both E0P2 and E3P2 possess more m-SWNTs than E0P1. These data are
consistent with the information provided by the UV–vis–NIR
and Raman spectra.

Figure 4 PL maps for concentration-matched samples of (A) E0P1,
(B) E0P2,
and (C) E3P2. Maps are set to identical intensity scales. Samples
were concentration-matched using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy
(absorbance of ∼0.27 at 1135 nm).

Lastly, we characterized our SWNT samples using electrical
conductivity
measurements via the van der Pauw method.78 We first prepared square-shaped thin films with dimensions of 0.5
× 0.5 cm for our polymer–SWNT samples by filtering 300
μL of polymer–SWNT dispersion through a Teflon filtration
membrane having a 0.2 μm pore diameter, clamped between two
solvent-resistant aluminum masks under vacuum. The samples were concentration-matched
using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy (Figure S9). The thin films were dried in an oven at 60 °C for
1 h and then resistance was measured by direct contact with four platinum
probes placed in the corners of the square-shaped thin film. Voltages
from 0 to 250 mV were applied to one pair of contiguous electrodes
and the current was measured on the opposite pair of electrodes (e.g.,
if the thin film corners were labeled from 1 to 4 clockwise, the first
measurement would apply V12 and measure I43). The thin film resistance (R) was calculated from the slope of the resulting I–V curve. The measurements were repeated
for all four electrode combinations (i.e., V12, V23, V34, and V41) and the total resistance
of the thin film (RT) was calculated as  (measured
in triplicate). The sheet resistance
(Rs) was then calculated as . It was found
that the Rs of the E0P2 thin film was
(3.6 ± 1.7) × 107 Ω/sq, and that the Rs of
the E4P2 thin film was (2.1 ± 0.7) × 106 Ω/sq.
The Rs difference of an order of magnitude
between the E0P2 and E4P2 samples is consistent with E4P2 possessing
a higher concentration of m-SWNTs than E0P2, which is corroborated
by the above analyses.

Encouraged by these results, we next
investigated our methodology
using plasma-torch SWNTs, which have a higher average diameter (tube
diameter of 1.1–1.5 nm)45 than HiPCO
SWNTs. Supramolecular complexes were prepared with plasma-torch grown
SWNTs according to the literature procedures (see the Supporting Information for details).68 Photographs of these dispersions can be found
in the Supporting Information (Figure S10). For plasma-torch SWNTs, there are four regions of interest in
the absorption spectrum: three semiconducting regions, including S11 (1400–1900 nm), S22 (750–1150 nm),
and S33 (420–580 nm), and one metallic region, M11 (600–750 nm).66 The spectra,
depicted in Figure 5, were normalized to the local maximum at ∼936 nm to highlight
the differences in m-/sc-SWNT content. Un-normalized spectra are provided
in the Supporting Information (Figure S11). Because the M11 and S22 regions do not overlap
with each other or the conjugated polymer absorption, it is possible
to estimate the m-/sc-SWNT ratio for the plasma-torch SWNT samples
using UV–vis–NIR spectroscopy.79 This analysis entails measuring the ratio of the integrations for
the M11 and S22 regions (as depicted in Figure S14, Supporting Information). In the P1–SWNT dispersions, >90% of the sample was composed
of sc-SWNTs. Meanwhile, for the P2–SWNT dispersions,
>65% m-SWNT content was present after the extraction process. This
indicates a 2-fold increase in the m-SWNT content compared to the
initial starting material (Supporting Information, Table S1).

Figure 5 UV–vis–NIR absorption spectra for the polymer–SWNT
extraction study using plasma-torch SWNTs. Polymer–SWNT dispersions
after 0–4 extractions for (A) P1 and (B) P2. Spectra are normalized to the local maximum at ∼936
nm to show relative m-SWNT and sc-SWNT content.

For plasma-torch SWNTs, only the 633 and 785 nm excitation
wavelengths
are in resonance for Raman analysis.7 As
before, all the spectra were normalized to the G-band (at approximately
1590 cm–1) for comparative analysis. At 633 nm (Figure S12A,B), a BWF line shape arises from
m-SWNTs.77 Relative to the raw SWNTs, the
suppressed BWF line shape for the P1–SWNT dispersions
suggests enrichment of sc-SWNTs. As the number of extractions increase,
the P1–SWNT dispersions begin to disperse m-SWNTs,
as evidenced by the increase in the G–-band intensity.
For the P2–SWNT dispersions, each sample exhibits
an intense G–-band, indicating the presence of m-SWNTs.
The 785 nm excitation wavelength (Figure S12C,D) was used to probe the presence of both m-SWNTs (135–175
cm–1) and sc-SWNTs (190–240 cm–1).71 As before, the P1–SWNT
dispersions exhibit m-SWNT signals only after multiple sc-SWNT removal
steps. The P2–SWNT dispersions, meanwhile, exhibit
intense m-SWNT signals after each extraction step. The UV–vis–NIR
and Raman data overall suggest that, similar to HiPCO SWNTs, m-SWNT
enrichment from plasma-torch SWNT samples is the highest when both
the initial m-/sc-SWNT ratio is high and an electron-poor conjugated
polymer is used as the final dispersant. This two-polymer system demonstrates
a proof of concept for producing enriched m-SWNT dispersions using
conjugated polymer sorting.

Conclusions
The design of an enrichment
methodology for m-SWNT species with
the potential for scalability has been explored. Using an electron-rich
conjugated polymer that produces enriched and concentrated sc-SWNT
dispersions, the initial m-/sc-SWNT ratio can be biased toward m-SWNTs.
Subsequent dispersion of the residue using an electron-poor conjugated
polymer produces dispersions with more m-SWNTs than possible using
only the electron-rich polymer. Characterization of HiPCO polymer–SWNT
samples using UV–vis–NIR, Raman, and fluorescence spectroscopy
indicate that the P2–SWNT samples possessed more
m-SWNTs than the P1–SWNT samples. The results
were corroborated with electrical conductivity measurements that showed
that the E4P2 sample had an order of magnitude lower sheet resistance
than the E0P2 sample. Characterization of the plasma-torch polymer–SWNT
samples via UV–vis–NIR and Raman spectroscopy indicated
that the same result could be obtained, irrespective of the SWNT diameter.
These results demonstrate a proof of concept for m-SWNT enrichment
using a two-polymer, electron-rich/electron-poor polymer system.
