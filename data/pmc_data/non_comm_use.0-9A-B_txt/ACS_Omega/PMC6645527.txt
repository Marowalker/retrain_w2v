Chitosan (CS)-graphene oxide (GO) composite
films were fabricated, characterized, and evaluated as pressure-driven
water filtration membranes. GO particles were incorporated into a
chitosan polymer solution to form a suspension that was cast as a
membrane via evaporative phase inversion allowing for scale-up for
cross-flow testing conditions. Morphology and composition results
for nano and granular GO in the CS matrix indicate that the particle
size of GO impacts the internal membrane morphology as well as the
structural order and the chemical composition. Performance of the
membranes was evaluated with cationic and anionic organic probe molecules
and revealed charge-dependent mechanisms of dye removal. The CSGO
membranes had rejections of at least 95% for cationic methylene blue
with mass balances obtained from measurements of the feed, concentrate,
and permeate. This result suggests the dominant mechanism of removal
is physical rejection for both GO particle sizes. For anionic methyl
orange, the results indicate sorption as the dominant mechanism of
removal, and performance is dependent on both GO particle size and
time, with micrometer-scale GO removing 68–99% and nanometer-scale
GO showing modest removal of 29–64%. The pure water flux for
CSGO composite membranes ranged from 2–4.5 L/m2 h
at a transmembrane pressure of 344 kPa (3.44 bar), with pure water
permeance ranging from 5.8 × 10–3 to 0.01 L/m2 h kPa (0.58–1.3 L/m2 h bar). Based on the
41 μm membrane thickness obtained from microscopy, the hydraulic
permeability ranged from 0.24–0.54 L μm/m2 h kPa (24.4–54.1 L μm/m2 h bar).

1 Introduction
Membrane
filtration is a cost-effective water treatment method
that provides excellent removal for a wide range of aqueous contaminants
with a relatively long lifetime and high product recovery.1 Novel nanomaterials provide an opportunity to
develop membranes in the nanofiltration regime that can address the
removal of contaminants not typically removed by microfiltration or
ultrafiltration.2,3 Polymeric membranes are the most
favorable candidates for nanofiltration membranes due to advantageous
thermal and chemical stability.4 Thermal
and chemical stability in a wide range of pH are observed for different
polymeric membranes, including poly(ether sulfone) (PES),5 poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF),6,7 polypyrrole (PPy),8 poly(m-phenylene isophthalamide) (PMIA),9 polyamide
(PA),10 and polysulfone (PSF).4 However, membrane fouling, low flux, and low
hydrophilicity are challenges that remain.11,12 Further, most polymers are derived from petroleum and thus represent
a fossil-fuel-based resource that presents opportunities for more
environmentally sustainable alternatives.

Chitosan (CS) is a
polymer and a derivative of chitin, which is
the second most abundant naturally occurring biopolymer on Earth.
Due to its biocompatibility, biodegradability, low toxicity, and antibacterial
and hemostatic properties, CS is a promising low-cost, renewable alternative
to petroleum-based synthetic polymers. Moreover, CS contains amino
and hydroxyl functional groups, which make CS hydrophilic. However,
the weak mechanical properties and the solubility of CS in acidic
aqueous environments are two critical challenges.13,14 Modification methods, including cross-linking strategies and the
use of mechanical reinforcement agents, can result in a more robust
membrane material that can overcome these drawbacks.15−17

Carbon nanotubes and graphene as carbon-based nanofillers
are not
ideal due to toxicity, hydrophobic properties, and agglomeration.
Graphene oxide (GO) is produced by chemical modification of graphene,
where oxidation causes the addition of hydroxyl, carboxyl, and epoxide
functional groups to the basal planes and edges of the graphene sheets.18 These functional groups make GO amphiphilic
with hydrophobic basal planes and hydrophilic edges.19,20 GO also has a high surface area, and studies have shown that it
is effective for adsorptive removal of heavy metal ions and cationic
dyes from water.21,22 The oxidative surface modification
of GO also enables its use as a dispersible nanofiller for water filtration
membranes due to the strong interactions between hydrophilic polymer
functional groups and GO.14,23 The addition of GO
to polymeric membranes comprised of PA,10 PES,5 PMIA,9 PSF,24 and PVDF6,7 resulted
in decreased fouling, as well as increased hydrophilicity and flux.
The addition of GO to a polymer matrix can also improve the thermal
stability and mechanical strength of the membrane5 and results in demonstrated increases in salt rejection
for PA,10 protein rejection for PES,5 arsenic rejection for PSF,24 and dye rejection for PMIA membranes.9

Chitosan-graphene oxide (CSGO) nanocomposites have
been investigated
for drug delivery, bone tissue engineering, and water treatment.25,26 Strong hydrogen bonds and electrostatic attraction between negatively
charged GO sheets and positively charged polysaccharide groups in
CS make CSGO a stable and biocompatible nanocomposite with excellent
mechanical and thermal properties.14,27−29 Therefore, CSGO composites can potentially be used for hydrostatic
pressure-based water filtration applications, where mechanical stability
is necessary.30 However, the application
of CSGO as a membrane or film has been limited to tissue engineering,31 drug delivery,27 sensors,32,33 and similar applications.30 In water
treatment applications, CSGO nanocomposites have primarily been used
as an adsorbent to remove contaminants such as chromium,34 copper ions,35 other
metal ions,25,36 and dye molecules14 from water. Earlier reports on GO membranes
have been limited to small experimental volumes and short durations,
which are not representative of real-world membrane operation.37 To our knowledge, no significant work has explored
CSGO membranes for pressure-driven water filtration.

In this
study, we present results on the morphology, composition,
structure, and water treatment performance of a unique set of CSGO
composite membranes where two sizes of GO particles, granular GO (0.3–0.7
μm in diameter) and nanoscale GO (90 nm in diameter), are evaluated
at a CS/GO ratio of 5:1 w/w and are compared to GO- and CS-only membranes.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Morphology of CSGO Membranes
GO,
CS/0, and CSGO membranes were first characterized by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) to assess the morphology and distribution of GO particles
in the CS matrix (Figure 1). CSGO membranes that contain granular and nanoscale GO are
designated as DG-CSGO and DN-CSGO, respectively. The GO membrane,
GO-free CS/0 membrane, and DG-CSGO membrane in Figure 1a–c, respectively, have a smooth and
homogeneous top surface. However, the DN-CSGO membrane’s top
surface, shown in Figure 1d, has a rough top surface morphology, where the structures
observed are due to the presence of nanoscale GO in the CS matrix.
Because the top surface morphology of the DN-CSGO membrane is unlike
that of either the GO membrane or the CS/0 membrane, it is difficult
to evaluate whether the CS or the GO controls the top surface morphology.
However, the different morphology observed in the DN-CSGO membrane
suggests that the presence of GO can cause a change in morphology,
as compared to GO-free CS/0.

Figure 1 SEM images of the top surface of (a) GO, (b)
CS/0, (c) DG-CSGO,
and (d) DN-CSGO membranes. SEM cross-sectional images of (e) GO, (f)
CS/0, (g) DG-CSGO, and (h) DN-CSGO membranes. The different 5 and
10 μm magnifications were chosen to highlight the detail and
layering arrangement of the membranes with appropriate comparison.

The cross-sectional images in Figure 1e–h further
support this conclusion,
as the cross-sectional membrane morphology for GO (Figure 1e) and DG-CSGO (Figure 1g) are quite similar (layered
structure of stacked sheets).38,39 In comparison, the
cross-sectional membrane morphology for DN-CSGO membrane resulted
in a nacrelike structure (Figure 1h), which suggests the GO sheets wrapped with CS polymer.17 Neither of the two CSGO membrane cross-sectional
morphologies resemble the CS/0 cross-sectional morphology, which is
smooth and homogeneous, similar to the CS/0 top surface morphology.
Overall, it appears that the incorporation of GO into a CS membrane
can cause significant changes in the top surface and cross-sectional
morphology, where GO appears to control the resulting morphology,
rather than CS. Furthermore, the size of the GO clearly has an impact
on the resulting membrane morphology. Membrane thickness was determined
to be 8.2, 52.5, 41.3, and 39.4 μm for GO, CS/0, DG-CSGO, and
DN-CSGO, respectively, using the SEM cross-sectional images (Supporting
Information, Figure S2a–d).

2.2 Chemical Composition of CSGO Composite Membranes
To
assess the chemical composition of each membrane, all of the
membrane samples were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) (Figure 2a–h).
The initial survey scans were taken between 0 and 1400 eV binding
energy for CS, GO, and CSGO films (survey scan of GO shown in Figure 2a). The XPS survey
scans were subsequently followed by detailed scans for carbon (C)
(275–295 eV) for all of the samples (Figure 2e–h) and nitrogen (N) (390–410
eV) for the CSGO membranes and the CS/0 membrane (Figure 2c–e). In addition, a
detailed survey scan for Al (70–80 eV) was performed for the
GO membrane (Supporting Information, Figure S3). The C 1s GO spectrum was analyzed for five types of C atom, where
C is part of a covalent bond with another element (C, hydrogen (H),
or oxygen (O)). Peaks assigned at 285.6, 286.8, 288, and 289.4 eV
correspond to C–OH, C–O, C=O, and C(O)O groups,
respectively.40 In addition, the first
peak at 284.8 eV is a combination of C–C and C=C bonds.41 The C–O peak represents the epoxide groups
typically found on the surface of GO.40 Hydroxyl (C–OH), carboxyl (C(O)O), and carbonyl (C=O)
peaks are also observed and expected on the oxidized surface of GO.
The dominant oxidized group is the epoxide group, and a significant
C=C peak is also observed, illustrating the graphene-based
honeycomb of carbon rings that is the backbone structure of GO. However,
the C–C and C=C peaks are close to each other, and a
smaller C=C peak is likely to be obscured by the large C–C
peak, preventing a full analysis of C–C versus C=C bonding
with XPS.

membranes. C 1s spectra of (e) GO, (f) CS/0, (g) DG-CSGO, and (h)
DN-CSGO membranes.

The C 1s XPS spectrum
of the CS/0 membrane indicates the presence
of C–C, C–O, and C=O groups at 284.8, 286.9,
and 287.9 eV, respectively, whereas the XPS results for both CSGO
membranes indicate the presence of C=C/C–C, C–O,
and C=O groups at 284.8, 286.9, and 287.9 eV, respectively.42 In comparison to the CS/0 membrane, the spectra
for CSGO membranes result in a wider peak at around 284.7 eV, indicating
the presence of C=C, along with the characteristic peak at
284.8 eV for the C–C group. Further, the intensity of the peaks
for C–O and C=O are larger due to the contribution of
GO.42

The initial survey scans for
the GO membrane resulted in no observed
peaks in the N 1s region (Figure 2a), as was expected, as GO by itself contains no nitrogen
groups. The N 1s spectrum for the CS/0 membrane (Figure 2b) resulted in three peaks
that can be correlated to the amine (C–NH2), amide
(C–NHC=O), and protonated amine species (C–NH3+) at 399.4 (86.34%), 400.5 (9.56%), and 401.7
eV (4.10%), respectively. Results for the N 1s XPS spectra are shown
in Figure 2c,d for
the DG-CSGO and DN-CSGO membranes, with no obvious difference between
the two CSGO membranes. However, there are shifts in the peak intensities
and related relative contributions to the N group speciation in CSGO
membranes, as compared to the GO-free CS/0 membrane. The results,
summarized in Table 1, indicate a reduction in the amine group contribution from 86.34%
for the CS/0 membrane to 80.68 and 83.50% for DG-CSGO and DN-CSGO
membranes, respectively. Moreover, an increase in protonated amine
species from 4.10% for the CS/0 membrane to 6.68 and 6.64% for DG-CSGO
and DN-CSGO membranes, respectively, is observed. The amide species
contribution also increased for DG-CSGO (12.64%) and, to a lesser
extent, for DN-CSGO (9.86%) membranes, as compared to the CS/0 membrane
(9.56%). The reduction in amine and increase in protonated amine and
amide species is likely connected to the electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding
interactions that form between the N-based groups in CS and the oxidized
functional groups on the GO surface.43 In
particular, both hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the GO surface could
facilitate the formation of protonated amine groups between CS and
GO, whereas the carbonyl and epoxide groups could potentially participate
in the formation of amide linkages through either electrostatic interactions
or covalent bonds.

When the results for the N group
speciation between the DG-CSGO
membrane and the DN-CSGO membrane are compared, the granular GO particles
appear to have a larger effect on speciation than the nanoscale GO
particles. This result suggests that the size of the GO particles
is not only important for controlling membrane morphology, as shown
in Figure 1, but is
also important for controlling the interactions between the CS polymer
and the GO particles in the composite membrane. In this study, the
GO powder of each particle size was added at the same mass concentration
to the CS solution to make the membranes. For the same mass, the larger,
granular GO would have a larger ratio of top and bottom surface area
to basal plane edges, as compared to the nanoscale GO, which would
have more edge surface area on a per mass basis, given the smaller
particle size. However, previous studies suggest that oxygen-containing
functional groups are often located at the edges, with some portion
of the functional groups on the surfaces.44,45 Our results suggest that either the granular GO has more carboxyl
and epoxide functional groups per unit mass or that the size of the
granular GO is more amenable to the formation of amide linkages with
the CS polymer molecules. The difference in observed N speciation
between the two sizes of GO particles may also reflect differences
in the GO particle dispersion and aggregation within the CS matrix,
where the lower amide speciation of DN-CSGO may indicate GO particle
aggregation and a resulting decrease in the accessible surface functional
groups available for amide linkage. As a result, the DG-CSGO results
in a greater number of interactions between GO and CS, represented
by protonated amine and amide groups, than the DN-CSGO composite.

EDX was also used during SEM imaging for the elemental analysis
of the membranes and support the results obtained by XPS (Table S1). Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
(FTIR) was used as a bulk technique to distinguish chemical bonds
present in all of the samples (Figure S4). The FTIR results support the XPS results for both C 1s and N 1s
spectra but are not able to resolve the detailed differences identified
with XPS.

2.3 Structural Characterization of CSGO Composite
Membranes
X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization (Figure 3) of dry membrane
samples was used to evaluate the crystallinity of each of the membranes,
as well as the interlayer spacing of GO. The XRD pattern of GO shows
a sharp peak at 10.5°. The XRD pattern for the CS/0 membrane
has two peaks at 8.5 and 11.4°, which are related to the hydrated
crystalline structure, and two broad peaks at 18.6 and 21.5°,
which are related to the amorphous structure of the CS film. In comparison
to the GO membrane, both CSGO membranes result in the loss of the
sharp peak at 10.5°, the disappearance of which indicates the
exfoliation of GO into the CS matrix. The XRD patterns of the CSGO
membranes also show the peaks that are related to CS at 21.5, 18.6,
11.4, and 8.5°. However, the peaks at 18.6 and 21.5° result
in significant broadening, suggesting an increase in the structural
disorder. Although the incorporation of granular GO particles increases
the intensity of the peaks characteristic of CS, the addition of nanoscale
GO particles decreases the intensity of these CS-related peaks at
11.4 and 8.5°. The increase in peak intensity of the DG-CSGO
pattern at these two peaks suggests an increase in the degree of crystallinity
after granular GO addition. However, the intensity reduction for the
peak at 11.4° for the DN-CSGO film suggests that this membrane
resulted in lower crystallinity after the addition of the nanoscale
GO particles to CS. The different results for the DG-CSGO and DN-CSGO
membranes again suggest that the GO particle size is in fact a critical
parameter for controlling membrane properties, including not only
morphology and chemical bonding but also crystallinity. The higher
crystallinity of the DG-CSGO is consistent with the layered, ordered
cross-sectional morphology observed in Figure 1, as compared to the more disordered, dispersed-particle
morphology of the DN-CSGO membrane cross section.

Figure 3 XRD patterns of dry CS/0,
GO, and CSGO membranes.

The behavior of the GO and CSGO membranes were also evaluated
as
wetted membranes by XRD. As shown in Figure S5, the peak of GO membrane is shifted to the left in the wet state
due to an increase in the interlayer spacing, whereas no sharp peak
was observed for the CSGO membranes in wet state because of loss of
crystallinity.

2.4 Membrane Performance: Pure
Water Flux and
Organic Dye Rejection
The performance of DN-CSGO and DG-CSGO
composite membranes were evaluated in a cross-flow cell and challenged
with the cationic methylene blue (MB) and anionic methyl orange (MO)
dyes. For MB, both composite CSGO membranes were able to remove greater
than 95% of MB from the solution at concentrations ranging from 1
to 100 mg/L. The flux rates for these solutions ranged from 2 to 4.5
L/m2 h with a transmembrane pressure of 344 kPa (3.44 bar),
with pure water permeance ranging from 5.8 × 10–3 to 0.01 L/m2 h kPa (0.58–1.3 L/m2 h
bar) (Figure 4). Both
DN-CSGO and DG-CSGO membranes resulted in similar thicknesses (Figure S2). Based on the 41 μm thickness
obtained from SEM, the hydraulic permeability ranged from 0.24 to
0.54 L μm/m2 h kPa (24.4–54.1 L μm/m2 h bar) (Figure S2). The tangential
flow on the membrane surface had a cross-flow velocity of 1.8 ×
10–3 m/s and a Reynolds number of 6.3 × 10–5. The rejection performance of DG-CSGO for MB was
quite similar to that of DN-CSGO, with no observable or statistically
significant difference in the rejection performance between the two
membranes. Further, the rejection performance of the two membranes
remained consistent over the range of MB concentrations tested. The
water flux decreased at higher MB concentrations for both membranes,
and the water flux measured during MB rejection studies was similar
to the measured pure water flux (Figure S7). It is perhaps surprising that the membranes behave similarly despite
the distinct differences in membrane morphology, structural order,
and chemical composition. The similar performance observed may result
from the swelling and loss of structural order that occurs in both
of the membranes in the hydrated state (as observed in wet membrane
XRD, Figure S5b). The loss of order observed
in the XRD results also suggests that the differences in nitrogen
speciation observed by XPS (Figure 2) are likely lost in the hydrated state, making the
two composite membrane structures much more similar in the hydrated
state than in the dry state.

Figure 4 Water flux, MB, and MO removal for (a) DG-CSGO
and (b) DN-CSGO
composite membranes, 10 mg/L constituent at 344 kPa (3.44 bar), and
1.8 × 10–3 m/s cross-flow velocity.

In the case of anionic MO, results indicate the
importance of electrostatic
effects as sorption appears to be the dominant mechanism of removal
with decreased performance over time. It is also noteworthy that in
contrast to MB, the performance of GO particle was observed to be
dependent on size, with micrometer-scale GO removing 68–99%
and the nanometer-scale GO showing modest removal of 29–64%.
As the CSGO composite membranes sorbed anionic MO dye, the overall
rejection efficiency diminished from 99 to 68% and from 64 to 29%
for the DG-CSGO and DN-CSGO membranes, respectively, throughout the
duration of evaluation, where the rejection in this case includes
both adsorption and physical sieving of the dye. Rejection was observed
for the DG-CSGO as the adsorbent sites were occupied; the MO concentration
within the concentrate stream initially decreased, but then increased
as the experiment continued. For the DN-CSGO, the concentration within
the concentrate stream initially decreased and remained constant for
the remainder of the experiment, indicating sorption without a clear
evidence of rejection. In addition to lower removal efficiency, the
flux for MO was also lower than that for MB, with a flux range from
0.5 to 2.1 L/m2 h, with a transmembrane pressure of 344
kPa (3.44 bar).

Further, although the water flux reported herein
is quite low,
membrane optimization (i.e., thickness and composition) will likely
allow an increase in flux. It is also interesting to note that flux
was not increased above the maximum of 4.5 L/m2 h even
when subjected to four different pressures between 1380 and 4140 kPa
(13.8–41.4 bar). However, the permeance range of 0.6–1.3
L/m2 h bar is consistent with the permeance range of 0.5–10
L/m2 h bar observed for GO composites in the literature
where GO is blended within another matrix.37 Despite the challenges presented for these composite membranes,
the initial performance evaluation of MB rejection demonstrates that
these membranes hold promise as a material that utilizes the advantageous
properties of both CS and GO in a scalable film suitable for roll-to-roll
(R2R) manufacturing. The difference in performance between the two
dyes analyzed indicates that electrostatic effects, in part, dictate
membrane performance. We anticipate this initial proof of concept
using CSGO as a competent, scalable membrane for pressure-driven,
cross-flow water treatment will serve to guide further optimization
of GO mixed matrix membranes.

Of the four types of membranes
fabricated, only the composite CSGO
membranes were able to be tested in the cross-flow system. The CS/0
membrane was unstable in an aqueous solution, as was expected for
an unmodified CS/0 film due to the solubility of chitosan in aqueous
solutions. The GO membrane, which was fabricated via the Anodisc-based
method vacuum filtration method, was not scalable and did not have
a surface area large enough to accommodate the cross-flow cell. The
challenges of CS/0 stability and GO fabrication scalability are thus
addressed in the formation of the CSGO composite membranes. The robust
and scalable CSGO composite membranes were evaluated in the cross-flow
system for up to 7 days and resulted in consistent pure water flux
measurements. However, in longer flux studies, an increase in pure
water flux was observed for some of the membrane samples tested, suggesting
an eventual instability of the composite in an aqueous system. This
instability is likely due to swelling and loss of structural order;
future work on these membranes will necessarily include optimization
of membrane stability and evaluation of membrane performance in long-term
cross-flow filtration studies.

In all of the experiments, formation
of a concentrated MB solution
in the reject stream of the cross-flow system (Figure S1d) was indicative of physical rejection. However,
both GO and CSGO composite materials are known to be excellent adsorbents
for dyes and other contaminants.18,25,29 Thus, to provide a mechanistic insight and avoid
attributing sorption to rejection, a mass balance on the MB was performed
(Table 2) to demonstrate
that the majority of the MB mass was rejected by the CSGO membranes,
rather than adsorbed. In parallel, the adsorption capacity of GO and
CSGO composite was evaluated. Although GO was measured to adsorb MB
with an adsorption capacity, Qe, of 139.29 mg/g, this sorption capacity
is greatly diminished to a Qe of 52.40 mg/g for the CSGO composite.
The reduction in adsorption capacity is likely due to the interaction
between protonated amines of chitosan and oxygen functionalities of
GO, which would reduce the number of available surface functional
groups that are able to coordinate with MB molecules. This result,
along with the mass balance calculations, indicates that as a CSGO
composite, sorption is not expected to be a dominant factor, which
is a benefit to a membrane separation. Conversely, for MO, sorption
appears to be the dominant mechanism, demonstrating the importance
of electrostatic effects.

a Concentrate stream contained greater
mass of MB than feed, which indicates an analytical error and no observable
adsorption.

3 Conclusions
Here, we report on a set of chitosan-graphene
oxide composite membranes,
where the size of the graphene oxide particles is shown to have a
direct impact on the membrane morphology, chemical speciation, structural
order, and membrane mechanical properties. CSGO membranes containing
either nanometer GO or micrometer-scale GO result in similar filtration
performance when pure water flux and rejection of the cationic dye
methylene blue. However, the differences in rejection and flux observed
during the filtration of anionic dye methyl orange suggest the size
of GO may impact the filtration performance and that the properties
of the contaminant are important to understand in relation to the
properties of the composite membranes. Overall, the CSGO membranes
had rejections of at least 95% for cationic methylene blue (MB), with
the mass balances obtained from measurements of the feed, concentrate,
and permeate. This result suggests the dominant mechanism of removal
is the physical rejection for both GO particle sizes. For anionic
methyl orange (MO), the results indicate sorption as the dominant
mechanism of removal, and performance is dependent on both GO particle
size and time, with micrometer-scale GO removing 68–99% and
nanometer-scale GO showing modest removal of 29–64%. The pure
water flux for CSGO composite membranes ranged from 2 to 4.5 L/m2 h at a transmembrane pressure of 344 kPa (3.44 bar), with
pure water permeance ranging from 5.8 × 10–3 to 0.01 L/m2 h kPa (0.58–1.3 L/m2 h
bar).

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
Graphene oxide was used
in the dry solid and water-dispersed state. GO was obtained commercially
as an aqueous suspension with a concentration of 6.2 g/L (Graphene
Supermarket, Calverton, NY). Granular and nanoscale dry solids GO
samples were also obtained at two different commercially reported
particle sizes (granular, around 90% 0.3–0.7 μm and nanoscale,
around 90% 80–105 nm, Graphene Supermarket, Calverton, NY).
The chitosan used was a form of deacetylated chitin from Sigma-Aldrich
(medium molecular weight (MW), poly-d-glucosamine). Acetic
acid was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (≥99%). Methylene blue
(MB) was used as a cationic molecular probe for this study and has
a molecular weight (MW) of 319.85 g/mol and a density of 1.77 g/mL.
Methyl orange (MO) (MW = 327.33 g/mol) was used as an anionic molecular
probe. Solutions of MB and MO were prepared from the laboratory grade
powder obtained from Merck and Fisher Scientific, respectively. Millipore
nitrocellulose membranes from Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) (Roll, 0.45 μm,
30 cm × 3.5 m, Cat #: 1620115) were used for the mechanical support
during cross-flow filtration. Anopore Anodized Aluminum Oxide Anodiscs
were obtained from Whatman GE Healthcare Life Sciences (0.2 μm
pore size, 60 μm thick, 47 mm diameter) and used for vacuum
filtration of GO suspensions.

4.2 Preparation
of Graphene Oxide (GO) Membranes
To prepare GO membranes,
50 mL GO suspensions were prepared by
diluting the commercial GO suspension (6.2 g/L) to 1 g/L with purified
water. The suspension was sonicated for 1 h and placed on a porous
anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) filter for vacuum filtration.38 The pH of the suspension was ∼3 due to
residual acid content from graphene oxidation. Filtration of the suspension
took approximately 72 h, at which point the dissolution of Al3+ from the AAO filter provided a cross-linking agent for the
GO laminate membrane to form the GO flakes assembled on the AAO filter.

4.3 Preparation of Chitosan Membranes (CS/0)
To prepare CS/0 membranes, 500 mg of medium molecular weight CS
was added to a 100 mL Nalgene bottle containing 50 mL water and approximately
0.33 mL 99% acetic acid. This procedure was followed by stirring the
solution for 72 h. Finally, the solution was poured into a petri dish
and dried in an incubator for 48 h.

4.4 Preparation
of Chitosan-Graphene Oxide (CSGO)
Membranes
A CS-rich GO suspension was prepared as follows:
0.3013 g of GO powder was added to 100 mL of purified water, stirred
for 15 min, and sonicated for 30 min. The dispersion was then poured
into an Erlenmeyer flask with 1.5 g of CS and 1 mL of acetic acid
(1% acetic acid solution). The composition of this casting solution
was 1.5 wt % CS and 0.3 wt % GO, and the CS/GO ratio in the cast membrane
was 5:1 w/w. This dispersion was placed on a stir plate and stirred
for 3 days at the highest speed. The mixing caused the CS powder to
fully dissolve and the GO to disperse in the aqueous acetic acid solution
and form a uniform mixture with a metallic gray color. The CSGO membranes
were fabricated by evaporation under reduced pressure for 72 h, which
eliminated the need for the AAO filter support used for GO-only membranes.

4.5 Morphological and Chemical Analysis
Surface
and cross-sectional membrane morphologies were evaluated
by scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Nova Nanolab 200, 15 kV). For
cross-sectional observation, liquid nitrogen was used to freeze the
samples before fracturing; the membranes were then freeze-fractured
so that the membrane cross section was exposed. Membrane sections
were mounted onto the SEM stubs with the top surface, bottom surface,
or cross section oriented for imaging. The films were sputter coated
with gold to prevent charging and then analyzed by SEM. Attenuated
total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR)
(Spectrum BX FTIR spectrophotometer equipped with Pike ATR accessory)
was used to evaluate the molecular interactions between GO and CS.
The spectra were obtained at 8 cm–1 resolution in
the absorbance wavelength range of 4000–500 cm–1. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS; PHI Versaprobe 5000 with
PHI MultiPack data analysis software) was used to evaluate the chemical
composition of the films. Initial survey scans (0–1400 eV binding
energy) were followed by detailed scans for carbon (275–295
eV) and nitrogen (390–410 eV). High-resolution X-ray diffraction
(XRD, Philips X’Pert- MRD diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation
source) was used to determine the crystallinity of the samples. The
XRD patterns were taken within the recorded region of 2θ from
5 to 35°, with a scanning speed of 1 min–1 at
a voltage of 45.0 kV and a current of 40.0 mA.

4.6 Tensile
Strength Testing
To measure
the mechanical properties of the CS/0 and CSGO membranes, a universal
mechanical testing machine (Instron 5944) was used to obtain the stress–strain
curves. The samples were cut in the same shape (40 mm × 10 mm)
with a different thickness, which was measured by the cross-sectional
SEM images (Figure S2). Five replicates
were performed for each membrane at room temperature with a strain
rate 5.0 mm/min and 0.05 N preload.

4.7 Membrane
Filtration and Rejection Experiments
4.7.1 Cross-Flow
Setup
After fabrication,
the freestanding membranes were sectioned with a Sterlitech membrane
die and placed one at a time in a cross-flow membrane cell to evaluate
pure water flux and contaminant rejection. The cross-flow system (Figure S1e) was set up such that the cell concentrate
was recycled to the feed flask; this was done so that the cross-flow
cell could run over several days with the same feed solution. Samples
from the concentrate and permeate streams were collected at least
once every 24 h to determine the flux and rejection. System and transmembrane
pressure data were recorded via pressure transducers obtained from
OMEGA Engineering. To control potential swelling of the membranes,
the membrane was physically confined between two nitrocellulose microfiltration
membranes (0.45 μm pore size, 30 cm × 3.5 m) during the
cross-flow filtration. Control experiments were performed to confirm
that when coupled with the CSGO membranes, the nitrocellulose support
would not contribute to dye removal. Adsorptive removal with the nitrocellulose
was less than 1% and was solely used as structural support for positive
pressure tangential flow experiments.

4.7.2 Organic
Dye Analysis
CSGO membranes
were tested for their ability to remove MB and MO in a series of cross-flow
filtration experiments. Dye solution, at varying concentrations, was
flowed through the cross-flow cell at pressures ranging from 69 to
414 kPa. The initial and final concentrations for the concentrate
and permeate were analyzed using an Agilent 8453 UV–vis spectrophotometer.
A linear calibration curve was used to calculate the MB and MO concentrations
from the absorbance readings, and the MB and MO detection limits were
estimated at 0.005 and 0.1 mg/L, respectively.
