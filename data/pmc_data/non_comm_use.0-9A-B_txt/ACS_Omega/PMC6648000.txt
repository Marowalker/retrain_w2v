The influence of
vapor and SO2 in coal firing flue gas
on the selective catalytic reduction activity of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was investigated at 150–275 °C. Denitration
experiments and detailed characterization of catalysts were conducted.
Vapor had no chemical effects on denitration, and the mechanism of
SO2 deactivating the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was investigated in detail. This is due to the reaction
between MnO2 and SO2 and the ammonium sulfate
deposits forming on the surface. Sulfation of the Mn-active component
was significantly reduced by doping the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst with Fe. Iron doping also lowered the stability
of the ammonium sulfate surface deposits, forcing them to rapidly
decompose. Thus, iron doping significantly improved SO2 resistance and the denitration efficiency of Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts was not clearly decreased.

1 Introduction
Gas emissions from industries
related to power production, steel
and nonferrous metals metallurgy, building materials, petrochemical,
and so forth, are the main sources of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which can cause severe human poisoning and plant
damage as well as photochemical pollution. Nitrogen oxides similar
with sulfur oxides contribute to acid rains and cause acid corrosion
damages. Therefore, nitrogen oxide emission is an environmental problem
worldwide1 and now an emergency in China
that needs to be solved.2−4 Selective catalytic reduction
(SCR) technology is the current industrial denitration technology
around the world, and it uses vanadium–tungsten–titanium
catalysts.5−7 However, its operation temperature is ∼350
°C, and it is active only upon contact with the hot flue gas.
Therefore, the SCR reactor is usually placed behind the economizer,
in front of the precipitator of high efficiency,8 and the flue gas desulfurization system; the alkaline metals
from the dust and dust itself as well as heavy metals and SO2-laden atmosphere poison and deactivate the catalyst, significantly
reducing its service life.9 However, if
the processing associated with denitration is placed after dedusting,
the flue gas is the cleaner and the catalyst maintains longer life.
However, in this case, the temperature of the flue gas is lower to
about 160 °C, for the conventional SCR temperature window is
350–420 °C, new efficient SCR denitration catalysts suitable
for the low temperature conditions are essential for these processes.

Currently, research on low-temperature SCR catalysts is mostly
concentrated around transition metals (e.g., Cu,10 Fe,11−13 Ce14). Catalysts based
on manganese oxides also received a lot of attention because of their
excellent low-temperature performance.15−17 However, activity of
manganese oxide catalysts is easily affected by vapor and SO2,18−20 which is often part of the flue gas even after it was dedusted and
desulfurized after circulating fluidized bed combustion. Therefore,
it is necessary to develop the sulfur-resistant and vapor-resistant
Mn-based catalyst. Doping Mn-based catalysts with Fe is a way to improve
the sulfur and vapor resistance of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The mechanisms of improving sulfur and vapor resistance
by Fe addition are focused on in this paper.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Catalyst Preparation
The Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst was prepared by a wet impregnation
method using γ-Al2O3 as the carrier and
MnOx and FeOx as active components. γ-Al2O3 powder
was heated at 110 °C for 2 h to remove weakly adsorbed water,
after which it was placed in a drying dish to cool and then sealed
in a sample plastic bag for storage. We prepared four different catalysts
using the procedures described below. Table 1 shows synthesis details.(1) Mn(NO3)2 solution
(analytical grade, the mass fraction was 50%) was placed in a 1 L
beaker, and 400 mL of deionized water was added under constant stirring.

(2) Four different amounts
of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (analytical
grade) were
placed in a beaker and dissolved in deionized water under constant
stirring (see Table 2). These solutions were then used to prepare Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

(3) γ-Al2O3 powder was placed
into the above solution under constant stirring
for 2 h, after which water was evaporated in a bath at 100 °C.

(4) After evaporation, products
were additionally
dried at 110 °C for 12 h and then calcined at 500 °C for
5 h. After cooling to room temperature, Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 powder catalysts were obtained.

(5) To prepare the pellets, the powders
were mixed with clay and sesbania gum powder and then compacted using
a press machine and dried at 110 °C for 12 h.

a Amounts of Mn(NO3)2 and γ-Al2O3 used to prepare these
catalysts were 38.3 mL and 120 g, respectively.

2.2 Characterization of the
Catalytic Activity
and Sulfur Resistance
The experimental setup system for low-temperature
SCR denitration using Mn-based catalysts is shown in Figure 1. The gas used was from the
coal-fired boiler tail flue. Catalyst pellets (3 mm in diameter and
3 mm long) were placed at ∼100 mm height upstream in the distributor
bed in a tube furnace (20 mm in diameter). Gas absorption and reduction
reactions were performed in a fixed bed. The inlet flue gas flow rate
was adjusted in such a way that the catalyst and the flue gas were
in contact for ∼1 s.

Figure 1 Schematics of the flue gas denitration setup.

To compare the NOx removal performance
and resistance of the catalysts to SO2, layers consisting
of sodium lime and allochroic silica gel were used to absorb SO2 and to dry the flue gas prior to its contact with the catalyst
first. The flue gas passing through enough soda lime was introduced
into the flue gas analyzer, and if the SO2 concentration
was not observed, the SO2 was completely removed, and then
the allochroic silica gel was controlled and no color change at its
top to ensure H2O was completely removed. Then, the soda
lime and allochroic silica gel were shorting switch for the SO2-resistance experiments.

Gas flow rates were controlled
by flow meters. Initial volume fractions
of each component in the mixed flue gas were the following: 0.03%
NOx, 0.033% NH3, 6 vt % vapor,
250 mg/m3 of SO2, and 6% O2 and N2 by balance. Gas superficial velocity was 6000–14 000
h–1, while the SCR catalyst layer height was varied
corresponding to the 1 s contact time. At each temperature, NOx from the flue gas was absorbed by the catalyst
and reacted with the active component. Gas composition before and
after the contact with the catalysts were analyzed using the flue
gas analyzer. The vapor content in the flue gas was measured by a
humidometer of EXTECH-RH101. Then, the NOx removal efficiency (ηNOx) was calculated using the following formula 1 1  cNOx,in: the volume concentration of NOx at the inlet of the flue gas; cNOx,out: the volume concentration of NOx at the outlet of the flue gas.

2.3 Characterization
The as-prepared
catalyst (1 g) was ground up to 200-mesh particles for further X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis, which was performed by an Ultima IV X-ray
diffractometer (Japan) using Cu Kα radiation at 40 kV and 40
mA with 2°/min scanning speed over the 10–80° 2θ
range.

Sample morphology was analyzed using a JEOL JSM-6390LV
scanning electron microscope. The specific surface area was determined
using Quantachrome Autosorb iQ3 (USA).

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Denitration Performance
of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts
Results of denitration experiments
obtained
using Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different
loadings of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts with different Fe additions are shown
in Figures 2 and 3, respectively.

Figure 2 NOx removal

Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

Figure 3 NOx removal efficiency with different
Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

The popular reaction mechanism
of the NH3 reaction with
NOx under the action of catalyst follows
the E–R or L–H mechanism, as described by the following
reactions.

The E–R model        

After NH3 was adsorbed on the Lewis acid sites21 (a molecule, ion, or group that can accept a
pair of foreign electrons) of the Mn catalyst, it was easily oxidized
to NH2(ad) and OH(ad) by the O(ad). NH2(ad)
reacted with NO to form an intermediate product NH2NO(ad),
which was finally decomposed into N2 and H2O.

The L–H model          

Unlike the E–R model, NO was first oxidized to NO2(ad) by O(ad) and then reacted with NH3(ad) and H+ to form NH4NO2(ad), which was reduced
to NH2NO(ad) and then to nitrogen. For there was a large
quantity
of oxygen in flue gas, O2(g) absorption was easily in advance
of NO(g) and NH3(g) to form the chemical adsorption oxygen.
Therefore, the L–H mechanism was more corresponding to the
denitration reaction in the low-temperature flue gas.

Denitration
efficiency of Mn/γ-Al2O3 series of the
catalyst reached 84% at ∼175 °C (see Figure 2). When Fe was added
to the catalyst, NOx denitration efficiency
reached 93% at ∼ 150 °C (see Figure 3), and it is similar to the DeNOx efficiency of the complex catalyst of Ce–Cu–V2O5/TiO2 in the flue gas temperature
range of 150–200 °C. Thus, Fe presence in the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts significantly improved their SCR activity
and lowered SCR temperature.

The most active low-temperature
SCR catalysts were Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3. Thus, these two catalysts were used for the
consequent experiments
and analyses.

3.2 Vapor and SO2 Influence on SCR
Activity of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts
The effect of vapor and SO2 on the SCR activity of Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
is shown in Figure 4. Experiments were performed at 150 °C, 6 vt % vapor, and 250
mg/cm3 SO2 concentration. For a more accurate
comparison, the catalysts were prepared using the same amount of initial
Mn(NO3)2 (see Tables 1 and 2), which were
also the most efficient SCR low-temperature catalysts tested in this
work. As shown in Figure 4, the vapor introduction in flue gas decreased the denitration
efficiency, about 8% for the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and 10% for the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst. After 10 h, the vapor supply was closed,
and the denitration efficiency of these two catalysts were all recovered
closely to the original performance. Therefore, the vapor adsorbed
on catalysts caused competitive physical absorption against the NH3 absorption over Lewis acid sites and prohibited the NH2NO(ad) reduction.

Figure 4 Effect of vapor presence on SCR activity of
Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The vertical dashed line at ∼625
min indicates
that the vapor is closed.

However, the presence of SO2 had a severe poisoning
effect on NOx removal efficiency using
the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst: it decreased
from 84 to 56% within 36 h (see the red curve in Figure 5). At the same time, the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst maintained 84% removal efficiency under
the same experimental conditions. Thus, Fe addition improved the performance
of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst when SO2 was present in the flue gas. When SO2 was removed
from the flue gas, catalytic activity recovered to some extent but
did not fully recover to the original levels. This indicated that
the effect of SO2 on the catalyst was not purely physical
adsorption.

Figure 5 Effect of SO2 presence on SCR activity of Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. The vertical dashed line at ∼45 h indicates
that the SO2 is closed.

The mechanism of SO2-resistance improvement when
Fe
doping in the manganese catalyst was investigated by varied characterization
means.

3.3 SO2 Influence on Physicochemical
Properties of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts
3.3.1 SEM
Analysis
To understand the
changes of catalyst efficiency and activity after Fe was introduced,
Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 as well as Mn-4/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-4/γ-Al2O3 were
analyzed using SEM (see Figure 6).

Figure 6 SEM micrographs of unmodified [(a) Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and (b) Mn-4/γ-Al2O3] as well
as Fe-doped [(c) Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 and (d) Mn–Fe-4/γ-Al2O3] catalysts.

Two types of crystals were observed
that were identified as spherical
α-MnO2 and rodlike β-MnO2. Spherical
α-MnO2 was observed in both Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 (see Figure 6a,b).
Rodlike β-MnO2 was formed in the Mn-4/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-4/γ-Al2O3 catalysts (see Figure 6b,d). Judging by the SEM images, the dispersion of the spherical
crystals on the catalyst surface may be improved upon Fe incorporation
into the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts. As the
amount of added Fe increased, spherical crystals on the catalyst surface
started to agglomerate and some fine rodlike crystals started to appear
eventually becoming larger as the Fe amount was further increased.
As the amount of rodlike crystals on the surface of the catalyst increased,
its denitration efficiency decreased.

Thus, the amount of added
Fe affected morphology of the catalyst
as well as the dispersion degree of the active components, both of
which contributed to its low-temperature denitration performance.

The catalyst variation was analyzed before and after denitration
of SO2-containing flue gas to understand morphology and
catalytic activity changes of Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 (see Figure 7). Before the reaction
with SO2, surface active groups on Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts were evenly distributed (see Figure 6a,c). After the reaction with sulfur-containing
flue gas, a large amount of big irregular particles was formed on
the surface of the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
(see Figure 7a). Surface
changes of the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
were small as only very some particles were formed (see Figure 7b).

Figure 7 SEM micrographs of (a)
Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and (b) Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 after
reaction with SO2-containing flue gas.

3.3.2 XRD Analysis
To determine phases
formed on the catalyst surface after the reaction denitration of SO2-containing flue gas, Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts
were analyzed using XRD (see Figure 8). Before the reaction, only peaks belonging to Al2O3 and MnO2 appeared. After the reaction,
additional peaks belonging to MnSO4 and NH4HSO4 appeared. Thus, the large irregular particles observed on
the surface of the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
were MnSO4 and NH4HSO4. XRD of the
fresh Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
showed only the diffraction peaks of γ-Al2O3. When Fe was present on the catalyst surface, distribution of the
MnO2 active component was more uniform and not clearly
detectible by XRD. No new diffraction peaks were observed in XRD spectra
of the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
after the reaction. Thus, none of the sulfates, observed for the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst after the reaction, were formed or
they were very small to be detected by XRD. This observation agrees
with SEM results.

Figure 8 XRD patterns of the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and
Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst before
and after the reaction with SO2-containing simulated flue
gas.

3.3.3 BET
Analysis
The catalyst variation
before and after the nitrication reaction under the presence of SO2 gas was analyzed using Brunner–Emmet–Teller
(BET). The specific surface area and pore volume of the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst decreased after the reaction from 136
m2·g–1 and 0.21 mL·g–1 to 87 m2·g–1 and 0.15 mL·g–1, respectively (see Table 3). In comparison, the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst decreased after the reaction from 129
m2·g–1 and 0.2 mL·g–1 to 115 m2·g–1 and 0.19 mL·g–1, respectively (see Table 3). Thus, addition of Fe suppressed specific
surface area loss and pore volume decrease upon reaction with SO2-containing flue gas.

and Average Pore Size of Mn-3/γ-Al2O3,

The number of mesopores with diameters 2–7
nm significantly
decreased for the Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst
after its reaction with the SO2-containing flue gas, as
shown in Figure 9.
The main reason for the surface area decrease was compared to the
surface area prior to this reaction.

Figure 9 Pore size distribution of (a) Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 and (b) Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts before and after reaction with SO2-containing
flue gas.

Surface area decrease reduced
denitration efficiency of the catalyst.22 However, after SO2 poisoning of the
Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalysts, mesopores
with pore diameters of 2–7 nm were still abundant and continued
to provide active reaction sites maintaining high catalytic activity.

3.4 Mechanism of SO2 Poisoning of Mn/γ-Al2O3 and Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 Catalysts
Deactivation of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst by SO2 occurs because of
the following reactions and processes. First, SO2 reacts
with NH3-forming NH4HSO4, which has
a decomposition temperature of ∼200 °C. Therefore, during
the low-temperature SCR, NH4HSO4 continuously
deposits on the catalyst surface gradually blocking the surface pores
and reactive sites causing catalytic activity degradation. MnSO4 formed upon reaction between SO2 causing active
component loss, which also significantly decreases catalyst activity.

The presence of Fe reduces sulfating of the active component on
the catalyst surface, thereby minimizing loss of Lewis acid sites.
At the same time, addition of Fe reduces stability of ammonium sulfate,
preventing catalyst pore blockage and coverage of the active sites.
All these factors play a significant role in improving anti-SO2 poisoning performance of the Fe-doped Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.

4 Conclusions
(1) Fe addition improves denitration performance
of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst to 93%, especially
at a low temperature of 150 °C of flue gas.

(2) At low temperatures, vapor effects
the denitration for its competitive adsorption and prohibition of
reduction, no poisons the catalyst; but the presence of SO2 during SCR reaction poisons Mn-3/γ-Al2O3 catalyst and decreasing its NOx removal
rate from 84 to 57.6%. Fe addition forms the Mn–Fe-2/γ-Al2O3 catalyst, which is able to maintain NOx removal efficiency close to 84.3% under the same
experimental conditions.

(3) A certain amount of ammonium sulfate
deposits on the surface of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst in a SO2-containing atmosphere decreasing the
specific surface area of the catalyst. Additionally, SO2 reacts with the most important active component (MnO2) of the Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalyst forming
manganese sulfate, which significantly decreases denitration efficiency
of the catalyst.

(4) Upon
Fe doping, reaction of MnO2 on the catalyst surface with
SO2 is minimized.
Additionally, ammonium sulfate deposits on the surface of the Mn–Fe/γ-Al2O3 catalyst decrease significantly as well. Overall
decrease of the specific surface area of the Fe-doped catalyst after
reaction with SO2-containing flue gas is not as significant
as for the undoped catalyst. Thus, Fe addition improves anti-SO2 poisoning performance of Mn/γ-Al2O3 catalysts.
