A lot of insecticides are found nowadays,
but neonicotinoids are considered the most famous. So, a series of
pyridine derivatives neonicotinoids analogues, namely, 3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine-2(1H)-one (1), 2-chloro-3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine
(2), 3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine-2(1H)-thione (3), 3-cyano-4,6-distyrylpyridine-2(1H)-thione (4), 2-((3-cyano-4,6-distyrylpyridin-2-yl)thio)-N-phenylacetamide (5), 3-amino-N-phenyl-4,6-distyrylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxamide

3-amino-4,6-distyryl-N-(p-tolyl)thieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxamide (8), 2-((3-cyano-4,6-distyrylpyridin-2-yl)thio)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)acetamide (9), and 3-amino-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)-4,6-distyrylthieno[2,3-b]pyridine-2-carboxamide (10), have been designed and
synthesized in pure state, and their agricultural bioefficacy as insecticides
against cowpea aphid Aphis craccivora Koch was screened. The structures of the synthesized compounds were
verified by means of spectroscopic and elemental analyses. Insecticidal
bioefficacy data illustrated that some compounds are excellent against
cowpea aphid, and the bioefficacy of the rest of the tested compounds
ranged from good to moderate against the same insects.

Introduction
Pyridine derivatives exist widely in
the nature and have different biological activities such as antimicrobial,
anticancer, antioxidant, insecticidal, etc.1−6 As a result, these compounds
have become an attractive target for chemists around the world. Pyridine
moiety constitutes a part of the neonicotinoids structure, and nowadays,
neonicotinoid insecticides are most commonly used in the world for
insect control because of their advantages in protecting a great variety
of crops, as well as high efficacy without cross-resistance to other
insecticides, low mammalian toxicity, a novel mode of action specific
for nAChRs, and broad insecticidal spectra.7−14

In contrast, there is a
clear evidence for the need of synthesis of some new organic compounds
neonicotinoids analogues although the advantages of neonicotinoids.
This evidence shows that some recent studies monitoring the human
and animal exposure to imidacloprid as neonicotinoid insecticide found
that DNA damage, oxidative stress, genotoxic effect, and clastogenic
effect can be produced after long-term exposure of rabbits to that
insecticide.15−18

Pyridine derivatives that contain
styryl group attached to the pyridine moiety were synthesized, and
some of them with a significant biological activity.19−22 The
data in our previous work encouraged us to continue the search for
new heterocycles containing pyridine moiety with agricultural bioactivity.1−3 In view of these findings, we
reported herein the synthesis of some new heterocyclic pyridine derivatives
and studied their insecticidal bioefficacy against cowpea Aphid, Aphis craccivora Koch.

Results and Discussion
The synthesis of the target compounds
started from malononitrile, which on reaction with acetylacetone afforded
compound 1 that undergoes chlorination with POCl3 to give compound 2. Compound 3 was
obtained by reaction of chloro compound 2 with thiourea.
Condensation of compound 3 with benzaldehyde in the presence
of few drops of piperidine resulted in the formation of distyryl derivative 4 (Scheme 1). All characterization data of compounds 1–4 were in agreement with those reported before.23−25

Scheme 1 Compound 4 was reacted
with α-halogenated carbonyl compounds (chloroacetanilide, p-methylchloroacetanilide, and p-methoxychloroacetanilide)
to afford 3-cyano-4,6-distyryl-2-substituted mercaptopyridines 5, 7, and 9. The chemical structures
of compounds 5, 7, and 9 were
confirmed by spectral and elemental analyses. Compounds 5, 7, and 9 underwent the Thorpe–Ziegler
cyclization upon heating in ethanolic sodium ethoxide solution affording
the corresponding thieno[2,3-b]pyridines 6, 8, and 10. The mechanism of the Thorpe–Ziegler
cyclization can be represented by Scheme 2.26 Spectroscopic
data and elemental analyses of compounds 6, 8, and 10 are in agreement with their proposed structures.

Scheme 2 IR spectrum of compound 5 showed absorption bands
at 3290, 2209, and 1663 cm–1 characteristics for
(NH), (C≡N), and (C=O) groups, respectively. The absorption
band of (C≡N) of compound 5 disappeared when cyclized
to give thienopyridine 6 and was replaced by bands at
3413 and 3303 cm–1 for NH2. 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) of
compound 5 illustrated singlet signals at 10.38 and 4.28
for (NH) and (CH2) groups, respectively. The signal of
the (CH2) group of compound 5 disappeared
when cyclized to give compound 6. DEPT 135 (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz) spectrum of compound 5 showed a characteristic signal at 35.68 for the (CH2)
group, which disappeared when cyclized to give compound 6.

IR spectrum of compound 7 showed absorption
bands at 3279, 2207, and 1664 cm–1 characteristics
for (NH), (C≡N), and (C=O) groups, respectively. The
absorption band of (C≡N) of compound 7 disappeared
when cyclized to give the thienopyridine compound 8 and
was replaced by 3416 and 3301 cm–1 for NH2. 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) of compound 7 illustrated singlet signals
at 10.32, 4.25, and 2.24 for (NH), (CH2), and (CH3) groups, respectively. The signal of the (CH2) group
of compound 7 disappeared when cyclized to give compound 8. DEPT 135 (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz)
spectrum of compound 7 showed characteristic signal at
35.64 for the (CH2) group, which disappeared when cyclized
to give compound 8.

IR spectrum of compound 9 showed absorption bands at 3281, 2215, and 1658 cm–1 characteristics for (NH), (C≡N), and (C=O) groups,
respectively. The absorption band of (C≡N) of compound 9 disappeared when cyclized to give thienopyridine 10 and was replaced by 3480 and 3299 cm–1 for NH2. 1H NMR spectrum (DMSO-d6, 400 MHz) of compound 9 showed singlet signals
at 10.12, 4.24, and 3.73 for (NH), (CH2), and (CH3 anilide) groups, respectively. The signal of (CH2) group
of compound 9 disappeared when cyclized to give compound 10. DEPT 135 (DMSO-d6, 100 MHz)
spectrum of compound 9 showed a characteristic signal
at 35.37 for the (CH2) group, which disappeared when cyclized
to give compound 10.

Conclusions
A new series of pyridine derivatives neonicotinoid analogues have
been synthesized in our lab, and their structures were proved by elemental
and spectroscopic analyses. The bioefficacy of all compounds as potential
insecticides against cowpea Aphid, A. craccivora Koch, was evaluated. The presence of different functional groups
in the structure of the compounds gave a variety of insecticidal activities
as potential insecticides. This study illustrated that the synthesized
pyridine derivatives have valuable agricultural bioactivities.

Experimental Section
A Fisher-Johns
apparatus was used to record the melting points of all synthesized
compounds. Infrared spectra and elemental analyses (C, H, N, and S)
were accomplished via a Pye-Unicam SP3-100 spectrophotometer using
the KBr disk technique and a Vario EL C, H, N, S analyzer, respectively.
A Bruker 400 MHz spectrometer was used to measure DEPT 135 spectra
and the 1H and 13C NMR spectra in the presence
of tetramethylsilane as an internal standard. Chemical shifts were
measured in ppm. Reaction progress and purity of the synthesized compounds
were monitored by thin-layer chromatography.

Compounds 1–4 were prepared according to the reported
methods.23−25 The reference
insecticide, acetamiprid neonicotinoid insecticide, was obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich (France). Cowpea aphid batches were compiled from faba
bean, Vicia faba L., fields of the
experimental farm of Assiut University. The insecticidal activity
of the reference neonicotinoid insecticide (acetamiprid) plus the
synthesized compounds was checked against adults and nymphs of the
gathered aphids.

Laboratory Bioassay
The insecticidal bioefficacy of all synthesized pyridine derivatives
was evaluated via the leaf dip bioassay method.27 Laboratory screening results are reported here for the
title compounds to find out the concentrations that are required to
kill 50% (LC50) of the gathered insects. In this work,
six concentrations of each synthesized pyridine derivative plus 0.1%
Triton X-100 (surfactant) were used. A total of 20 adults and 20 nymphs
of cowpea aphids, almost of the same size, were dipped three times
in every concentration for 10 s. Tested cowpea aphids were dried at
room temperature for 0.5 h. Cowpea aphids control batches were also
used. Batches of aphids after drying were transported to Petri dishes
(9 cm diameter) and grasped for 24 and 48 h at a photoperiod of 12:12
light/dark cycle, 22 ± 2 °C, and 60 ± 5% relative humidity.
Mortality of the aphids was counted after 24 and 48 h of test by means
of a binocular microscope. The aphids that are not capable of coordinating
forward movement were considered dead. Bioefficacy check of the synthesized
compounds was iterated twice, and the results of this check were corrected
using Abbott’s formula.28 Slope
values and median lethal concentrations (LC50) of the title
compounds were calculated through a computerized Probit regression
analysis program and recorded in (ppm).29

Insecticidal Bioefficacy Screening
The synthesized compounds have been screened for their insecticidal
bioefficacy, as described below:

Insecticidal
Bioefficacy Test for the Nymphs of Cowpea Aphid
Compounds 1–10 were tested against the nymphs of
the collected aphids for their insecticidal bioefficacy, and the results
are presented in Table 1. After 24 h of treatment, bioefficacy results indicated that all
of these compounds exhibit high to low insecticidal activity against
the cowpea aphid nymphs and the LC50 values ranged from
0.175 to 2.341 ppm, whereas the LC50 value of acetamiprid
was 0.045 ppm. After 48 h of treatment, it is found that the insecticidal
bioefficacy of all compounds against cowpea aphid nymphs varied from
strong to weak with LC50 values assorted from 0.017 to
0.151 ppm, while the LC50 value of acetamiprid was 0.006
ppm, which indicates that a number of them have insecticidal bioefficacy
close to that of acetamiprid insecticide after 48 h of test. For example,
compounds 2 and 9 have excellent insecticidal
activities against nymphs of cowpea aphid because their LC50 values were 0.017 and 0.021, respectively, and the LC50 value of acetamiprid was 0.006 ppm after 48 h of treatment.

a Toxic ratio is defined as the ratio

Insecticidal Bioefficacy Test for the Adults
of Cowpea Aphid
Compounds 1–10 were tested also against the adults of the collected aphids for
their insecticidal bioefficacy, and the results are presented in Table 2. The results indicated
that after 24 h of insecticidal bioefficacy test, the compounds own
strong to weak bioefficacy and LC50 values assorted from
0.887 to 9.431 ppm, while 0.225 ppm was the LC50 value
of acetamiprid. Compounds 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,
and 10 possess a high insecticidal bioefficacy, and their
LC50 values are 1.660, 0.887, 2.612, 1.482, 1.265, 2.262,
2.623, and 2.101 ppm, respectively. The insecticidal activities of
the tested compounds strongly increased against cowpea aphid adults
after 48 h of bioefficacy test, and the values of LC50 assorted
from 0.103 to 1.172 ppm. Thus, compound 2 showed a high
insecticidal bioefficacy close to that of acetamiprid because the
value of LC50 of compound 2 is 0.103 ppm,
while the LC50 value of acetamiprid is 0.023 ppm. Compounds 1 and 3 showed a reasonable insecticidal bioefficacy
with LC50 values of 1.172 and 0.472 ppm, respectively.

Structure–Action Relationship
It appears from the general framework structure of the synthesized
pyridine moiety-containing compounds that the compounds 2-chloro-3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine 2 and 2-((3-cyano-4,6-distyrylpyridin-2-yl)thio)-N-(4-methoxyphenyl)acetamide 9 are more active against
cowpea aphid than the rest of tested compounds. It also appears that
compounds that contain a distyrylpyridine part in the structure own
a high insecticidal bioefficacy than compounds 1 and 3 that contain a dimethylpyridine part in the structure. So,
compounds 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have insecticidal
activity more than that of compounds 1 and 3. Compounds 5, 7, and 9 are
more active than compounds 6, 8, and 10, which may be due to the presence of cyano group in the
former and its absence in the latter. Compound 9 has
more activity than compounds 5 and 7, which
may be due to the presence of 4-methoxyphenyl moiety in its structure
and the absence of this moiety in compounds 5 and 7. Also, compound 10 is more active against cowpea
aphid than compounds 6 and 8, which may
be due to the presence of 4-methoxyphenyl moiety in its structure.
Although compounds 1 and 3 that contain
a dimethylpyridine part have a reasonable insecticidal bioefficacy,
compound 2 which contain this part in its structure is
considered more active than all synthesized compounds, which may be
due to the presence of chlorine atom attached to the pyridine ring.
Finally, the insecticidal bioefficacy of compound 3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine-2(1H)-thione 3 is more than that of compound 3-cyano-4,6-dimethylpyridine-2(1H)-one 1, which may be due to the presence
of thiol group in its structure.
