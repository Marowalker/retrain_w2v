Oxygen
reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts are one of the main topics
for fuel cells and metal/air batteries. We found that the platinum–cobalt
alloy nanoparticles prepared by our original nanocapsule method exhibited
a high ORR catalytic activity in alkaline solution, compared with
that of the existing alloy nanoparticles prepared by different methods.
The effect of alloy composition on the ORR activity was investigated
to find the optimum composition (approximately 40 atom %). We also
found that the enhancement of the catalytic activity in alkaline solution
appeared in a very narrow range of Co content compared with that in
acidic solution.

Introduction
Electrocatalysts for
oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) have attracted
considerable attention in particular for energy applications such
as fuel cells and metal/air batteries. Current state-of-the-art ORR
catalysts for polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells are based on
platinum and platinum alloys because they exhibit a high ORR activity
and reasonable stability in the acidic media.1−6 Because of the high cost and the limited availability of platinum
resources, it is crucial to reduce the usage of platinum for wide-spread
commercialization of fuel cells. The use of Pt alloys with transition
metals has been recognized as an effective approach for this purpose.
In addition, the alloying with some transition metals results in improved
catalytic activity. For example, it was found that Pt3Co
(atomic ratio) is approximately three times more active than Pt in
terms of kinetically controlled mass activity (MA).7,8

We have developed a unique preparation method for platinum alloy
(V, Ni, Cr, Co, and Fe) nanoparticles, in which metal precursors were
encapsulated in reverse micelles (nanocapsules) and reduced in the
presence of an electroconductive carbon black support.9 The alloy nanoparticles thus obtained had small particle
size distribution and controlled alloy composition and were well-distributed
on the electroconductive support materials such as carbon black. PtCo/C
catalysts exhibited an higher ORR activity than that of Pt/C in the
acidic media; however, the activity decreased at an elevated temperature
or potential cycling because of surface dealloying.7,8

Replacing acidic membranes with alkaline membranes is potentially
advantageous for the use of transition metals as cathode materials
because their oxides are stable in alkaline media.10 It has also been reported that PtCo alloys exhibited a
high ORR catalytic activity in the alkaline media.11−14 In this study, we investigate
the ORR activity in the alkaline media of the PtCo/C catalysts prepared
by the nanocapsule method. A series of the alloy catalysts were prepared
and characterized to find out the optimum alloy composition.

Results
and Discussion
PtCo alloy nanoparticles were prepared via
slightly modified nanocapsule
method. Briefly, Pt(acac)2 and Co(acac)3 were
used as metal precursors, oleic acid and oleylamine were used as surfactants,
diphenyl ether was used as a solvent, and LiBEt3H was used
as a reducing agent (see Supporting Information for details). Although Ketjenblack has often been used as a carbon
support, acetylene black (AB800, 779 m2 g–1 of Brunauer–Emmett–Teller specific surface area) was
adopted in the present study because the latter contains less interior
nanopores and thus contributes to higher catalyst utilization (metal
nanoparticles located in the interior nanopores of the carbon support
are much less likely to function as a catalyst).15 The loading amounts of the metals were determined by TG/DTA
analyses to be from 16.3 to 20.6 wt %, which were within acceptable
errors for the feed metal composition (projected value was 20.0 wt
%). The average alloy compositions obtained by X-ray fluorescence
(XRF) analyses were x = 0, 31, 39, 42, 51, and 73
atom % for Pt100–xCox, which were similar to the feed values (0, 25, 40,
45, 50, and 75 atom %, respectively).

Figure 1 shows transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) image and particle size distribution histogram
of Pt61Co39/AB800 as the typical example (see Figure S1 for the other samples). From the image,
it was revealed that the nanoparticles with small diameter were well-distributed
on the high-surface-area acetylene black carbon support. The average
particle size (and the standard deviation) was 3.0 (±0.4) nm.
Similar results were obtained for the other Pt100–xCox/AB800 samples with
different alloy compositions. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns
(Figure S2) of Pt100–xCox showed diffraction
peaks assignable to face-centered cubic (fcc) phase of Pt in addition
to the characteristic broad peak of the carbon support (2θ =
approximately 25°). No peaks assignable to Co metal and oxides
were detected in any of these samples. The lattice constants for the
alloy samples decreased when increasing the Co content (Figure S3). As expected, the change in the lattice
constant was smaller than that calculated from the Vegard’s
law because of the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) structure of Co metal.
The nearly linear relationship between the lattice constant and the
Co content indicates the formation of the solid solution with fcc
structure. The average crystallite size was calculated by Scherrer’s
equation using the peak at approximately 67° (200 plane) and
is summarized in Table 1. These values were in fair agreement with the average particle sizes
obtained from the TEM images. The results were very similar to those
of our previously reported Pt100–xCox alloy nanoparticles supported on
a different carbon support (Ketjenblack).9

The
Pt100–xCox/AB800 catalysts were loaded on a glassy carbon (GC) disk electrode
and covered with a thin layer (approximately 50 nm thick) of a commercial
anion exchange polymer (Tokuyama AS-4). The catalyst particles were
seen to be well-dispersed and relatively uniform on the GC disk without
notable aggregation. Figure 2 shows cyclic voltammograms (CVs) of the electrodes in 0.1
M KOH aqueous solution purged with nitrogen at 25 °C. The CVs
showed typical redox waves for surface Pt at approximately 0.8 V versus
reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and hydrogen adsorption/desorption
waves for polycrystalline Pt below approximately 0.3 V versus RHE.
The presence of Co in the alloy samples contributed to the development
of anodic and cathodic peaks at approximately 0.68 and 0.45 V versus
RHE, respectively. This broad redox peak couple could be associated
with the surface Co hydroxide species. The electric charge calculated
from the reduction peak area increased when increasing the Co content
from 13.5 C g–1 (x = 31), 25.1
C g–1 (x = 39), 29.3 C g–1 (x = 42), to 45.2 C g–1 (x = 51) because of the increased number of Co atoms on the
surface. However, it decreased to 32.2 C g–1 for x = 73. The results suggest that dealloying was likely to
take place rather easily and immediately in alkaline solution when
Co content was high. Nevertheless, the potential cycling between 0.05
and 1.0 V versus RHE did not practically change the shapes of the
CVs at least up to 80 cycles, indicating a stable surface structure.
The electrochemically active surface areas (ECSAs) were calculated
from the electric charge of the hydrogen desorption wave, assuming
0.21 mC cm–2 for smooth polycrystalline Pt. The
ECSA was 23 m2 g–1 for x = 31 and decreased with increasing x (12 m2 g–1 for x = 73) (Figure S4). The values were significantly lower
than those (approximately 80–100 m2 g–1) calculated from the diameter (dTEM)
of the alloy nanoparticles and those (approximately 77 m2 g–1) of Pt67Co33/AB800 in
acidic conditions.16 The results suggest
that, unlike in acid solution where Pt skin layer forms on the surface
of PtCo nanoparticles by potential cycling, Co atoms were present
on the surface of the nanoparticles (Pt100–xCox/AB800) in alkaline solution.
A similar result was obtained for the commercial Pt75Co25/AB800 catalyst (Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo TEC36F52) whose ECSA
was also low, 50 m2 g–1 (based on dTEM) and 21 (ECSA) m2 g–1 (data not shown).

Figure 2 CVs of Pt100–xCox/AB800 (x = 0, 31, 39, 42,
51, and
73) in 0.1 M KOH saturated with N2 at 25 °C. The scan
rate was set at 50 mV s–1.

Figure 3 shows
hydrodynamic
voltammograms for the ORR at the ionomer (AS-4)-covered Pt100–xCox/AB800 working electrode
in air-saturated 0.1 M KOH aqueous solution at 25 °C. (The rotation
rate was 1750 rpm. See Figure S5 for the
data of other rotation rates.) The ORR current started at 0.970 V
and reached to diffusion limit at approximately 0.5 V for x = 0. With an increasing Co content, the ORR currents started
at higher potential and reached at the maximum (0.995 V) with x = 39 and 42. Further increase in x resulted
in lower potential for the commencement of ORR currents. The formation
of hydrogen peroxide (PH2O2) with respect to the overall ORR calculated from the current
detected at the ring electrode at 0.8 V was negligibly small (<0.7%)
and became even smaller with an increase in x (PH2O2 = 0.2% for x = 73), indicating that the four electron transfer process
was dominant. The formation of H2O2 was similarly
low in acidic conditions for PtCo nanoparticle catalysts prepared
by the nanocapsule method.7

Figure 3 Hydrodynamic voltammograms
for ORR in 0.1 M KOH saturated with
air at 25 °C at Pt100–xCox/AB800 catalysts deposited on a GC disk electrode
(1750 rpm). The scan rate was set at 5 mV s–1. The
ring potential was set at 1.1 V vs RHE to detect H2O2 produced at the catalysts.

To quantify the effect of the alloy composition in Pt100–xCox/AB800 on the ORR
catalytic activity, MA per platinum for ORR at 0.85 V was calculated
and is plotted as a function of Co content in Figure 4. It was found that Pt100–xCox/AB800 exhibited the
maximum MA (767 A g–1) with x =
39 and 42. The MA values were comparable or somewhat higher than those
reported for PtCo alloy nanoparticles deposited on the carbon support
prepared by different methods.12 Pt100–xCox/AB800 also exhibited the maximum MAs (641 and 628 A g–1) per metal at the same compositions. As is discussed in the literature,12 it is considered that the alloying effect on
the enhancement of ORR catalytic activity is based on weakened chemical
adsorption of OH species (OHads) onto surface Pt atoms,
resulting in more available sites for ORR. However, further increasing
Co contents (>approximately 40 atom % in the present case) reduced
surface Pt atoms and thus lowered the ORR catalytic activity, resulting
in the volcano-type dependence of the ORR activity on the Co content.
Compared with the acidic conditions where the maximum MA was obtained
at x = 25,7 the optimum
Co content was higher in the alkaline conditions. It is noticeable
that the composition range of Co to show enhanced ORR activity is
very narrow. The differences in the optimum Co content and its composition
range between acidic and alkaline conditions might be associated with
the surface Co hydroxide species. For reference, MA per platinum was
also included in Figure 4 for commercial Pt/C catalyst. Pt/AB800 prepared by the nanocapsule
method exhibited higher catalytic activity (MA) than that of the commercial
Pt/C catalysts presumably because the Pt nanoparticles were more uniform
and better dispersed on the carbon support for the former catalyst.
Similar results were obtained in acidic conditions as reported in
our previous reports.15,17

the ORR reaction
at 0.85 V vs RHE as a function of Co content. The open symbol at x = 0 was for the commercial catalyst, Pt/C (Tanaka Kikinzoku
Kogyo TEC10E50E).

The durability of Pt61Co39/AB800 was evaluated
with an accelerated durability test (ADT), which was comprised of
potential step cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V versus RHE in 0.1 M KOH
aqueous solution saturated with nitrogen at 40 °C. During ADT,
the redox peaks (ascribed to hydrogen adsorption/desorption and oxidation/reduction
of surface Pt and Co atoms) in the CV curve became smaller (Figure S6). The ECSA was 40 m2 g–1 initially (note that the CVs and hydrodynamic voltammograms
were measured at 40 °C, and thus, initial ECSA and MA values
in Figure 5 were higher
than those measured at 25 °C in Figures 4 and S4 and Table 1) and decreased to
approximately 12 m2 g–1 within 2000 cycles.
Then, the ECSA gradually leveled off to 9 m2 g–1 at the end of testing (30 000 cycles) (Figure 5a). The commercial Pt/C exhibited similar
behavior under the same conditions. Although the initial ECSAs were
different, these two catalysts showed comparable ECSAs at the end
of testing. The MA values for two catalysts decreased when increasing
the step cycle numbers (Figure 5b), in a trend similar to ECSA values. The results would suggest
that coarsening of the nanoparticles happened during the ADT. This
idea was partly supported by the TEM image of the post-ADT sample
(Figure S7), in which agglomeration of
the nanoparticles was observed. However, 3.6 nm of the average particle
size (dTEM) was slightly higher than the
initial value (3.0 nm) and did not account for a large decrease in
MA. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analyses suggested that the average
Co content of the post-ADT sample was 26 and 13 atom % lower than
that of the pristine sample. From the volcano dependence of ORR activity
on Co content in Figure 4, large loss in MA seemed reasonable. Therefore, it is considered
that both coarsening and dealloying in Pt61Co39/AB800 during ADT contributed to the loss in the ORR catalytic activity.

Conclusions
A series of Pt100–xCox alloy nanoparticles
dispersed on a high-surface-area
acetylene black carbon (AB800) support were prepared by our original
nanocapsule method, and their ORR catalytic activity was evaluated
in the alkaline media. Unlike the acidic media where PtCo alloys form
Pt skin layer, cobalt atoms seemed rather stably present on the particle
surface during the initial electrochemical potential cycling (at least
80 cycles) in alkaline solution that caused smaller ECSAs. The Pt100–xCox alloy nanoparticles exhibited volcano-type dependence of the ORR
activity on the alloy composition. At the optimum composition (x = approximately 40 atom %), the MA per platinum was 2.6
and 6.4 times higher than those of Pt/AB800 (prepared via the same
method) and the commercial Pt/C, respectively. However, in a durability
test comprised of potential step cycles between 0.6 and 1.0 V, the
PtCo alloy catalysts lost ORR catalytic activity because of particle
agglomeration and dealloying. Because the nanocapsule method is potentially
applicable to other metals and alloys, we will continue to explore
more active and stable ORR catalysts both in the acidic and alkaline
media.

exchange polymer [AS-4, ion-exchange capacity (IEC) = 1.4 mequiv/g]
was kindly supplied by Tokuyama Co.

Preparation of Carbon-Supported
PtCo Nanoparticle (PtCo/AB800)
Catalysts
PtCo/AB800 catalysts were prepared according to
the following procedure slightly modified from our previous method.
A typical procedure is as follows: Pt(acac)2 (0.13 mmol),
Co(acac)3 (0.13 mmol), and 1,2-hexadecanediol (260 mg)
were dissolved in 12.5 mL of diphenyl ether under a nitrogen flow
in a 100 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer bar.
The mixture was heated at 110 °C for 30 min followed by the addition
of oleic acid (0.27 mmol) and oleylamine (0.24 mmol). The mixture
was heated at 220 °C for 30 min. LiBEt3H (1.0 mL)
was added dropwise into the mixture. The mixture was heated at 270
°C for 30 min and then cooled to 200 °C. The mixture was
slowly added into a suspension of acetylene black AB800 (129.6 mg)
in 12.5 mL of diphenyl ether. The mixture was heated again at 270
°C for 1 h and then, cooled to 50 °C. The product was recovered
by filtration, washed with ethanol several times, and dried at 60
°C in a vacuum oven. The black powders thus obtained were heated
at 400 °C for 4 h in 5% hydrogen (nitrogen balance).

Measurements
PtCo/AB800 catalysts were characterized
by XRD (Rigaku RINT2000) with Cu Kα radiation (50 kV, 300 mA),
TEM (Hitachi H-9500, acceleration voltage = 200 kV), and XRF (Shimadzu
EDX-800). The loaded amounts of the metal on carbon were quantified
by thermogravimetric analyses (TGA, Rigaku Thermo plus TG8120) in
air from room temperature to 600 °C.

Preparation of the Electrodes
A typical rotating ring-disk
electrode (RRDE) was used. The Pt ring electrode had a 3.5 mm inner
radius and a 4.5 mm outer radius. The GC disk electrode had a 3 mm
radius (0.283 cm2 geometric area Ageo). The electrode was polished with 1 μm alumina paste
for 30 min, 0.3 μm alumina paste for 10 min, and 0.05 μm
alumina paste for 10 min, to ensure a mirror finish, and was then
washed with ethanol and water in an ultrasonic bath.

PtCo/AB800
(14.3 mg) was dispersed in 15 mL of 99% ethanol. The mixture was mixed
in an ultrasonic bath to obtain a homogeneous suspension, of which
10 μL of aliquots was pipetted onto the GC disk electrode, which
was dried slowly at room temperature under a nearly ethanol-saturated
atmosphere to avoid aggregation of the PtCo/AB800 particles. The loading
amount of PtCo was calculated to be 6.3 μg cm–2. A 2 μL of aliquot of Tokuyama AS-4 aqueous solution was pipetted
onto the PtCo/AB800-loaded GC disk electrode. The concentration of
Tokuyama AS-4 was 0.22 wt % to achieve the targeted thicknesses of
Tokuyama AS-4 thin layer (approximately 0.05 μm), which was
estimated based on the specific gravity of the dry membrane. The solutions
were dried slowly at room temperature under a nearly ethanol-saturated
atmosphere to obtain the Tokuyama AS-4-PtCo/AB800-loaded electrodes.

Electrochemical Techniques
RRDE equipment (Nikko Keisoku
RRDE-1) with a gas-tight Pyrex glass cell was used to evaluate the
ORR catalytic activity of the electrodes. A ring-shaped platinum wire
and a RHE were used as the counter electrode and the reference electrode,
respectively. All electrode potentials are stated relative to the
RHE. The electrolyte solution, 0.1 M KOH, was prepared from 3 M KOH
and Milli-Q water (Millipore). Before the ORR experiments, the working
disk electrode was cleaned by cycling the potential between 0.05 and
1.0 V at a sweep rate of 0.5 V s–1 in deaerated
0.1 M KOH until steady voltammograms were obtained. The ECSA of Pt, APt, was evaluated from the electric charge of
the hydrogen adsorption ΔQH in the
negative-going potential scan from 0.05 to 0.40 V in cyclic voltammetry
at a sweep rate of 0.05 V s–1 at 25 °C. After
bubbling air in 0.1 M KOH for 30 min, hydrodynamic voltammograms for
the ORR at the working disk electrodes were recorded by sweeping the
potential from 0.2 to 1.0 V at a rate of 5 mV s–1 and at rotation rates of 1000, 1250, 1500, 1750, 2000, 2250, 2250,
and 2750 rpm. The Pt ring collection electrode was potentiostatted
at 1.1 V, where the anodic oxidation of hydrogen peroxide is diffusion-limited.
The collection efficiency for this RRDE system was determined experimentally
to be 0.365 using 1 mM K3[Fe(CN)6] in 0.5 M
K2SO4 aqueous solution. All of these electrochemical
experiments were performed at 25 °C.

Durability Test
The durability test of Pt61Co39/AB800 and commercial
Pt/C catalysts were performed
in 0.1 M KOH saturated with nitrogen at 40 °C. The potential
was stepped between 0.6 and 1.0 V, with a holding period of 3 s at
each potential (6 s for one cycle). After a given number of potential
step cycles (N), RRDE measurement was taken as mentioned
above to examine the changes in the CV, ECSA, and ORR catalytic activities
at 40 °C.
