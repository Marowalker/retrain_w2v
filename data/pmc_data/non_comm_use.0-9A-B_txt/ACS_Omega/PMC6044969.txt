Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(ω-3 PUFAs) are bioactive
lipids with considerable impact in medicine and nutrition. These compounds
exert structuring effects on the cellular membrane organization, regulate
the gene expression, and modulate various signaling cascades and metabolic
processes. The purpose of the present work is to demonstrate the structural
features of ω-3 PUFA-containing three-dimensional supramolecular
lipid assemblies suitable for pharmaceutical applications that require
soft porous carriers. We investigate the liquid crystalline structures
formed upon mixing of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5) with the lyotropic
nonlamellar lipid monoolein and the formation of multicompartment
assemblies. Starting with the monoolein-based lipid cubic phase, double
membrane vesicles, cubosome precursors, sponge-type particles (spongosomes),
mixed intermediate nonlamellar structures, and multicompartment assemblies
are obtained through self-assembly at different amphiphilic compositions.
The dispersions containing spongosomes as well as nanocarriers with
oil and vesicular compartments are stabilized by PEGylation of the
lipid/water interfaces using a phospholipid with a poly(ethylene glycol)
chain. The microstructures of the bulk mixtures were examined by cross-polarized
light optical microscopy. The dispersed liquid crystalline structures
and intermediate states were studied by small-angle X-ray scattering,
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, and quasielastic light
scattering techniques. They established that PUFA influences the phase
type and the sizes of the aqueous compartments of the liquid crystalline
carriers. The resulting multicompartment systems and stealth nanosponges
may serve as mesoporous reservoirs for coencapsulation of ω-3
PUFA (e.g., EPA) with water-insoluble drugs and hydrophilic macromolecules
toward development of combination treatment strategies of neurodegenerative
and other diseases.

Introduction
The necessity of improved safety of the
currently developed drug
delivery systems, aiming at reduced side effects, strongly stimulates
the research on naturally occurring products, biomimetic and bio-inspired
materials, and components.1−12 Lipid-based nanostructured dispersions are well recognized as gentle
and biocompatible drug delivery systems.13−20 Cubosomes, hexosomes, spongosomes, or vesicular lipid assemblies
are fabricated depending on the amphiphilic compositions and the employed
dispersing agents.21−57 Among the nanostructured carriers, the liquid crystalline lipid
assemblies have shown considerable potential in protecting instable
encapsulated molecules from degradation and enhancing their bioavailability
and diffusion through the biological barriers.2,15,24,36,43,47−50

The health benefits of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
(ω-3
PUFAs) and their influence on the membrane structure and functions
have attracted significant interest.58−81 The aim has been a better comprehension of the membrane fusion mechanism,
the induction of higher curvature regions or transient tubular intermediates
in the subcellular compartments, the possible non-bilayer phase formation,
the effects on the protein activity in the plasma membranes and the
synaptosome, the activation of signaling cascades, enzymatic regulation,
gene expression, stress responses, and the prevention of inflammation
reactions.58,59,79−96 The current interest in the ω-3 PUFAs properties is motivated
by the fact that this class of bioactive lipids is implicated in a
number of diseases related to neurodegeneration, ageing, inflammation,
depression, vision, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, atherosclerosis,
coronary heart disease, etc.82−96 The neuroprotective effects of the ω-3 PUFA derivatives are
of particular importance for upcoming pharmaceutical applications
in which these lipids may exert protection against neurotoxin-induced
cell apoptosis.

The long-chain ω-3 PUFAs like cis-5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic
acid (EPA) (20:5) and cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic
acid (22:6) are amphiphiles with a nonlamellar propensity, which are
considered as membrane structuring lipids.62,76 They may be expected to generate synthetic liquid crystalline structures
with new properties when self-assembled with “helper”
lipids (Scheme 1).
The structural effects of ω-3 PUFAs have been scarcely investigated
in three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular assemblies as compared to
their influence on the membrane fluidity and ion permeability.53,63,64,76 So far, PUFAs have been demonstrated to reduce the membrane bilayer
thickness, increase the membrane fluidity, and boost the membrane
permeability in connection with possible domain formation or induction
of negative curvature strain.61,65−72,77,81

Scheme 1 Molecular Structures of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Monoolein
(MO)
It should be noted that the
ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids
are poorly water-soluble compounds of low stability upon administration.
Delivery of PUFAs and fish-oil-based formulations has been done using
oil-in-water emulsions.97−102 Oxidative stability of the lipid dispersions has been achieved by
coencapsulation of PUFAs with natural antioxidants.50 The recently developed internally self-assembled nanostructured
carriers (ISAsomes)32 offer new opportunities
for encapsulation and delivery of PUFAs as bioactive lipid ingredients.
Such carrier particles (cubosomes, hexosomes, or spongosomes) do not
rapidly break upon contact with biological fluids after administration
and may provide sustained release.3,6,24,43,44,49 Moreover, they can be sterically
stabilized by hydrophilic shells to avoid eventual aggregation in
the milieu.3,10,14,29,47,48

The purpose of the present work is to reveal
the multiscale structural
organization of EPA-encapsulating carrier lipid systems for potential
uses in neuroregenerative therapies. The structural modifications
triggered by the incorporation of EPA (as a representative ω-3
PUFA) in monoolein (MO) lyotropic liquid crystalline assemblies are
investigated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryogenic
transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The hydrated bulk mixtures
are characterized by cross-polarized light optical microscopy (POM).
The quasielastic light scattering (QELS) technique is also applied
to get insights into the mechanism of formation of stable nanodispersions
involving the bioactive lipid EPA.

Results and Discussion
We present morphological and structural results characterizing
the properties of hydrated bulk and nanodispersed lipid mixtures of
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and monoolein (MO) at varying molar contents.
The spontaneously self-assembled mesophase structures are governed
by the intermolecular interactions and the curvature preferences of
the lipid components in the mixtures, i.e., by their mean critical
packing parameters (CPP).8 MO is a lyotropic
lipid forming bicontinuous cubic structures in excess aqueous medium.22,30 EPA, as a long-chain ω-3 PUFA compound with five double bonds
(Scheme 1), has a nonlamellar
propensity in membranes.61 However, it
has not been reported to form lyotropic nonlamellar liquid crystalline
structures as a single-component amphiphile. By mixing of EPA with
the lyotropic lipid MO, we accomplished tuning of the average critical
packing parameter of the binary mixtures, which provoked the induction
of intermediate liquid crystalline states between 3D cubic and 3D
sponge-like lipid membrane organizations.

Liquid Crystalline Phase
Transitions of Bulk Mixtures Established
by POM
The microstructures of bulk mixtures of EPA and MO
and the composition-induced lyotropic phase changes were studied by
cross-polarized light optical microscopy (POM). The purpose was to
inspect the occurrence of an eventual macrodomain phase separation,
which may be a problem for the preparation of dispersed nanocarriers. Figure 1 presents POM images
of a hydrated self-assembled MO/EPA mixture (90:10 mol/mol) in the
absence and in presence of the PEGylated phospholipid (1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamide-N-[methoxy(poly(ethylene
glycol))-2000]) (DOPE-PEG2000). At this low molar content
of EPA, the obtained thin liquid crystalline layer appeared as an
optically isotropic viscous phase typical for a MO cubic phase assembly.
The discontinuity of the spread film resulted from the physical agitation
and deposition of the viscous sample (Figure 1a–c). Fragmentation of the bulk bicontinuous
cubic phase into smaller entities was observed also by POM upon addition
of the PEGylated dispersing agent (2 mol % DOPE-PEG2000) (Figure 1d). The
structural dimensions of the cubic unit cells formed in the presence
and in the absence of the PEGylated lipid were determined in the small-angle
X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigation (see the results presented in Figure 4 below).

Figure 1 Cross-polarized
light optical microscopy (POM) images of a self-assembled
mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid and monoolein (MO/EPA ratio 90:10
mol/mol) in the absence (a–c) and in presence (d) of a PEGylated
phospholipid (2 mol % DOPE-PEG2000). The hydration level
of the bulk sample corresponds to a lipid/water ratio 40:60 (w/w).

Figure 2 shows the
POM micrographs of anisotropic liquid crystalline patterns obtained
at increasing EPA content in the hydrated bulk MO/EPA mixtures (40
wt % lipid phase; 60 wt % aqueous phase). The inclusion of EPA (from
15 to 50 mol % with regard to MO) led to the nucleation of microdomains
corresponding to a structural phase transition from an isotropic bicontinuous
cubic to a mixed type of liquid crystalline organization combining
both nonlamellar and lamellar structures. The observed birefringence
patterns reveal the anisotropic distribution of the lipid membrane
curvature, which may reflect the deficiency of embedded EPA with regard
to the MO fraction. On the microscopic scale, the examination under
cross polarizers did not establish large domains of fan-shaped textures
typical for a single inverted hexagonal phase. The texture shown in Figure 2c suggests the presence
of a small portion of a lamellar phase. Therefore, the anisotropy
of the liquid crystalline supramolecular organization reflects the
coexistence of cubic domains (seen as dark areas) and other intermediate
structures (birefringence patterns), which grow by nucleation from
the isotropic cubic phase (Figure 2). Macroscopic phase separation between the EPA and
MO materials was not observed, which demonstrated the capacity of
the hydrated nanochanneled structures of MO for solubilization of
the ω-3 PUFA component.

Figure 2 POM micrographs of bulk hydrated MO/EPA mixtures
self-assembled
at EPA contents, which yield anisotropic bulk liquid crystalline organizations:
(a) MO/EPA ratio 85:15 (mol/mol), (b, c) 80:20 (mol/mol), and (d)
70:30 (mol/mol). The lipid/water ratio is 40:60 (w/w).

At EPA content above 50 mol %, the microtexture
of the bulk MO/EPA
mixtures adopted an emulsion-type morphology (Figure 3). The large cubic phase domains of irregular
boundaries diminished (Figure 3a), whereas the volume occupied by spherical dropletlike textures
increased with the increase of the EPA molar fraction (Figure 3b–d). Birefringence
patterns were not observed at MO/EPA lipid ratios 30:70 mol/mol (Figure 3b), 20:80 mol/mol
(Figure 3c), and 10:90
mol/mol (Figure 3d).
This suggested that the binary lipid mixtures undergo a transition
from an anisotropic nonlamellar organization to an isotropic phase,
which lacks a long-range order. The presence of correlations between
the lipid bilayers was examined by SAXS in self-assembled systems
dispersed in an excess aqueous phase (see the results in Figure 5 below).

ratios (a) MO/EPA 50:50 (mol/mol), (b) 30:70 (mol/mol), (c) 20:80
(mol/mol), and (d) 10:90 (mol/mol). The images are recorded at different
magnifications using objectives 10× (image size: 880 × 660
μm2) (c), 20× (image size: 440 × 330 μm2) (b, c), and 40× (image size: 220 × 165 μm2) (d). The lipid/water ratio is 40:60 (w/w) in all bulk phase
samples.

Liquid Crystalline Structural
Organization Determined by Small-Angle
X-ray Scattering
Hydrated monoolein forms a well-organized
bicontinuous cubic phase in excess of aqueous buffer phase, giving
a well-resolved diffraction pattern. The effect of the additive, DOPE-PEG2000, on the structure of the MO/water cubic phase is demonstrated
by the SAXS results in Figure 4. For the pure MO/water system,
the indexing of the detected Bragg peaks identified a bicontinuous
double diamond cubic phase of the space group Pn3m and a cubic lattice spacing a = 10.4
nm. The inclusion of the PEGylated lipid induced a cubic-phase coexistence
involving primitive Im3m and double
diamond Pn3m cubic phase domains.
The sequences of resolved Bragg peaks determined the following cubic
cell dimensions at room temperature: a(Pn3m) = 13.3 nm (with a first Bragg peak positioned
at q = 0.067 Å–1) and a(Im3m) = 23.0 nm (with
a first Bragg peak positioned at q = 0.039 Å–1). These results demonstrated the increase of the
cubic lattice dimension upon addition of the DOPE-PEG2000 amphiphile.

phase monoolein/water
cubic phase and effect of the addition of a PEGylated lipid on the
self-assembled MO/DOPE-PEG2000 structure (40 wt % lipid
phase/60 wt % aqueous phase). The sets of Bragg peaks are indexed
for a Pn3m cubic phase (red bars)
and for Im3m/Pn3m cubic phase coexistence (pink and blue bars).

The investigated self-assembled
mixtures of EPA and MO were functionalized
by the PEGylated phospholipid DOPE-PEG2000 (at a constant
percentage of 2 mol %) toward the fabrication of sterically stabilized
nanocarriers upon dispersion by sonication in excess aqueous buffer
phase. The structural organizations of the nanoparticulate dispersions
obtained at varying MO/EPA ratios were examined by synchrotron radiation
SAXS. The dispersions containing low molar fractions of EPA were filtered
(using a 0.2 μm pore-sized microporous filter membrane) toward
the preparation of sterile-quality nanocarriers necessary for pharmaceutical
applications. It can be supposed that lipid material might be lost
during the filtration of the nanoparticulate dispersions. For this
reason, we report the effect of the filtering on the obtained SAXS
patterns.

Figure 5A presents the SAXS results as a function
of the amphiphilic
composition. The SAXS patterns in Figure 5A (plots 1–4) appear to be representative
for liquid crystalline dispersions containing objects of nanoscale
sizes, for which the eventual inner periodic organization could not
produce strong diffraction peaks. Such objects are visualized by cryo-TEM
microscopy in Figures 7 and 8 below.

(5 wt % lipid/95 wt % water) dispersions of PEGylated eicosapentaenoic
acid/monoolein assemblies MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000. (A) The
MO/EPA ratio varies in the sequence 1:0 mol/mol (plot 1), 85:15 mol/mol
(plot 2), 80:20 mol/mol (plot 3), 70:30 mol/mol (plot 4), 50:50 mol/mol
(plot 5), 40:60 mol/mol (plot 6), and 30:70 mol/mol (plot 7) at a
constant percentage of DOPE-PEG2000 (2 mol %) with regard
to MO. Aqueous phase: 1 × 10–2 M phosphate
buffer containing butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). The samples corresponding
to the SAXS plots (5–7) are not sterile-filtered. (B) Indexing
of the Bragg peaks recorded at an MO/EPA ratio of 50:50 mol/mol. The
inset shows the fitted original SAXS plot (5) from panel (A).

The SAXS curves of the filtered
MO/DOPE-PEG2000 and
MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 dispersions (Figure 5A, plots 1–4) reflect the bilayer
membrane organization of the nanoparticles governing their small-angle
scattering through the form factor. Bragg peaks of an inner cubic
structure are lacking similar to the case of the precursors of MO-based
cubosome particles dispersed by polysorbate 80 as a surfactant.103

The SAXS patterns acquired at increasing
EPA molar fractions indicated
the formation of particles of nonlamellar inner organization (Figure 5A, plots 5–7).
The inclusion of EPA favored a more dense internal structure of the
PEGylated nanocarriers. The nonfiltered lipid membranous assemblies
yielded Bragg diffraction peaks at an MO/EPA molar ratio 50:50 (Figure 5A (plot 5) and Figure 5B). Toward the interpretation
of the obtained mesostructures, the SAXS pattern was fitted via a
superposition of Bragg peaks of several liquid crystalline phases.
The performed Bragg peaks indexing for coexisting lamellar, onion
bilayer, and inverted bicontinuous cubic structures is demonstrated
by the bars of different colors in Figure 5B. The intensities of the Bragg peaks for
the lamellar structure are relatively weak and they are positioned
at q1 = 00705 Å–1, q2 = 0.141 Å–1, q3 = 0.2115 Å–1, and q4 = 0.282 Å–1, respectively. The corresponding repeat lamellar distance of the
PEGylated multibilayer lipid membranes is d = 8.9
nm. A minor fraction of lipid bilayers arranged in onionlike structures
is also present. The Bragg peak at q1 =
0.134 Å–1 determined a repeat spacing L = 4.7 nm. Such onionlike structures are observed in the
cryo-TEM micrographs in Figure 11.

The strongest peak of an inverted cubic membrane
structure is positioned
at q1 = 0.114 Å–1 (Figure 5B) and belongs
to a sequence of eight reflections defining the presence of a double
diamond inner cubic organization of the Pn3m space group. The obtained lattice dimension a(Pn3m) = 7.8 nm revealed the weak
hydration of the cubic unit cell at increasing EPA content in the
MO/EPA mixtures. The same conclusion was derived from the cryo-TEM
results presented below. The weak reflection observed at q1 = 0.176 Å–1 in Figure 5B could not be assigned to
a Bragg reflection of a well-ordered lattice. It might correspond
to fragments (with internal symmetry) of previously existing three-dimensional
structures. One can suppose the formation of different structures
or their fragments due to “dissolution” of the cubic
phases.

At higher EPA molar fractions (MO/EPA molar ratios 40:60
and 30:70
mol/mol), the strong cubic and lamellar peaks merged into a single
broad peak centered at q ∼ 0.15 Å–1 (Figure 5A, plot 6) and at q ∼ 0.18 Å–1 (Figure 5A, plot 7). These broad peaks are interpreted as arising from
the fluctuation of the lipid bilayers within the 3D membrane assemblies.
The correlation distances of the lipid bilayer membranes are determined
to be L = 4.2 nm (plot 6; 60 mol % EPA) and L = 3.5 nm (plot 7; 70 mol % EPA). Evidently, the increase
of the EPA content leads to dehydration of the inner structure of
the nanocarriers. Taking into account the cryo-TEM results shown in Figures 12 and 13, it can be deduced that the sterically stabilized
MO/EPA mixtures may form sponge-type membranous assemblies with tunable
dimensions of the aqueous channel compartments depending on the PUFA
content. It can be suggested that the EPA-induced membrane curvature
change triggers a liquid crystalline phase transition to a randomlike,
fluctuating lipid membrane organization, which is consistent with
the formation of sponge-type nanocarriers (Figures 12 and 13).

The
quasielastic light scattering (QELS) measurements with MO/EPA
dispersions stabilized by DOPE-PEG2000 indicated the coexistence
of nanoparticle populations in some of the recorded size distribution
diagrams (Figure 6).
The histogram graphs in Figure 6a,c identified a population of small particles, with a mean
hydrodynamic diameter centered at dh ∼
40 nm and a second population with a mean diameter centered at dh ∼ 120–300 nm. Taking into account
the obtained results from the cryo-TEM imaging (presented below),
this result can be interpreted as a coexistence of small vesicular
bilayer membranes and larger particles, e.g., precursors of cubosomes,
spongosomes, or intermediate type structures and multiarchitecture
assemblies. Figures 9–13 well reveal the topological characteristics
of such coexistences.

Figure 6 Hydrodynamic nanoparticle size determination by quasielastic
light
scattering. The MO/EPA molar ratios in the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 dispersions are 1:0 mol/mol (a), 85:15 mol/mol (b), 50:50 mol/mol
(c), 70:30 mol/mol (d), 40:60 mol/mol (e), and 30:70 mol/mol (f).
The bimodal distributions represent the fractions of small-size and
large-size particles coexisting in the sample volumes. Aqueous phase:

Compartmentalized Membranous
Architectures Revealed by Cryo-TEM
Imaging
The composition-dependent evolution of the nanocarrier
morphologies during the spontaneous self-assembly process in the hydrated
MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 mixtures was directly visualized by
cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The performed
imaging remarked the effect of the sample preparation procedure for
the topology of the dispersed nanocarriers in addition to the major
role of the molar ratio between the amphiphiles MO and EPA in the
3D nanoarchitecture formation. Figure 7a,b presents the
morphology of the MO/DOPE-PEG2000 particles before the
addition of EPA. After the passage through the 0.2 μm pore-sized
filter membrane, the dispersed system contained double membrane vesicles,
some of which were of a vase-like architecture. Small vesicular membrane
objects were observed in the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 dispersions
subjected to ultrasonication (Figure 7c,d). Owing to the fact that filtering of the samples
removes the big objects of inner 3D lipid membrane organization, the
majority of the studied liquid crystalline carriers were prepared
by moderate sonication of the lipid mixtures in an ice bath. Figure 8 indicates that the sonication procedure may yield various
nonequilibrium morphologies such as cubosomal precursors and perforated
vesicular architectures in addition to unilamellar vesicles and double
bilayer membrane containers. Upon storage, these precursor structures
may fuse or rearrange toward the formation of stably existing self-assembled
nanocarrier structures involving EPA (Figures 9–13).

Figure 7 Cryo-TEM images of double membrane nanocarriers MO/DOPE-PEG2000 (98:2 mol/mol) obtained after sterile filtering using
0.2 μm pore-sized microporous membrane filters (a, b), and of
MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 carriers (MO/EPA ratio 70:30 mol/mol)
dispersed to small vesicles through vigorous physical agitation (c,
d).

showing the unilamellar vesicles, perforated vesicular architectures,
double bilayer membrane containers, and cubosomal precursors observed
at MO/EPA ratios 85:15 mol/mol (a), 80:20 mol/mol (b, d), and 50:50
mol/mol (c) after sterile filtering of the samples. These objects
may represent the populations of small particles detected in Figure 6a–c.

Figure 9 Cryo-TEM images of dispersed MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 carriers
(MO/EPA ratios 80:20 and 85:15 mol/mol) showing a coexistence of cubic
membrane particles (cubosomes) (a, b, d), intermediate type of nonlamellar
structures (c), and bilayer membrane vesicles (a–d). The aqueous
medium contains the antioxidant BHT ensuring the oxidative stability
of the formulations.

Figure 9 shows
cryo-TEM
micrographs of cubosome particles obtained at MO/EPA ratio 80:20 (mol/mol)
in the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 mixture. The performed fast
Fourier transform of the image in Figure 9b confirmed the nonlamellar periodic internal
structure of nanochannels inside the nanocarriers. The projected plane
corresponds to a cubic lattice packing of a primitive type. In the
excess aqueous medium, the well-shaped cubosomes coexisted with bilayer
membrane vesicles and some intermediate type of nonlamellar structures
at an MO/EPA ratio 85:15 (mol/mol) (Figure 9c).

At equal molar content of EPA and
MO in the self-assembled mixture
(50:50 mol/mol), the topology of the nonfiltered nanocarrier system
involved particles with dense cores as well as mixed types of lipid
containers (Figure 10). The cryo-TEM images showed a large fraction of dense nanoparticles.
Moreover, Figure 10b reveals a nanocarrier of a mixed type, in which a dense oil-like
compartment and a vesicular aqueous compartment are joint. The resulting
interface is well visible. The presence of oil-rich droplets is indicative
of the formation of EPA-rich nanodomains.

Figure 10 Cryo-TEM images of nanocarriers
in MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 dispersions at an MO/EPA ratio 50:50
(mol/mol). Dense particles
(a, c, d) coexist with mixed objects built-up by an oil compartment
joined to a vesicle (b). The dense particles can be cubosomes rich
in EPA.

Figure 11 demonstrates a
rich variety of topologies generated
at an MO/EPA ratio of 40:60 (mol/mol) in the nonfiltered MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 dispersed system. The observed heterogeneity comprises
vesicular membranes’ morphologies with different genus, multilamellar
liquid crystalline structures, precursors of spongosomes, and dense
oil-like compartments (Figure 11a–d). Some of the nano-objects exhibited edges
at their peripheries or at their inner compartments. The coexistence
of liquid crystalline lipid membranous particles, of various topologies,
with more dense structures of oil dropletlike morphology represents
the inhomogeneous distribution of the membrane curvature at this amphiphilic
composition. Although the MO membranes appear to be a good solubilization
medium for the EPA molecules, the excess of EPA tends to form oil-rich
nanodomains or compartments inside the carriers. Figure 11c demonstrates a mixed object
consisting of an aqueous compartment, surrounded by a bilayer lipid
membrane (vesicle) and an adjacent oil compartment rich in EPA. Such
mixed type carriers may be of interest for combination therapies requiring
encapsulation of both hydrosoluble and liposoluble drug molecules.

Figure 11 Cryo-TEM
images of multiarchitecture assemblies (a–d) formed
in the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 lipid system at a MO/EPA ratio
40:60 (mol/mol). The dispersed objects involve interfaces with uneven
distributions of the membrane curvature. Lipid bilayers arranged in
onionlike particles are also present.

Figure 12 shows the nanocarrier topologies in the
MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 system at a molar ratio 30:70 (MO/EPA,
mol/mol). The different
panels display the possible stages of the perforation of the lipid
membrane vesicles and their assembly into 3D structures. Mesoporous
liquid crystalline architectures are generated starting from perforated
vesicular membranes. The PEGylated vesicular particles are stabilized
by double membrane peripheries, and their core gets perforated upon
the formation of nanochanneled architectures. The compartmentalization
of the membranous structures is done through interlamellar attachments
between the bilayers. Figure 12 indicates how the varying degree of lipid membrane perforation
results in a swollen-type nanosponge organization. The density of
the aqueous channels in these carriers is low, whereas the channel
size is large. We refer to these sponge-phase particles as spongosomes
with large channels.

Figure 12 Cryo-TEM images of nanosponge particles generated at an
MO/EPA
ratio 30:70 (mol/mol) and stabilized by 2 mol % DOPE-PEG2000. The aqueous dispersion contains spongosome carriers with different
degrees of membrane perforation, which yields swollen sponge membrane
type inner organization of the particles (a–i).

It should be noted that the insufficient quantity
of the employed
PEGylated agent provoked heterogeneous topologies of the spongosomes
and hence differences in the nanochannels hydration. The performed
cryo-TEM investigation established that the dispersed spongosome carriers
(spongosomes with large channels) coexist with a weakly hydrated sponge-phase
(Figure 13). The density of the aqueous nanochannels in this
fraction of the liquid crystalline sample appears to be essentially
higher as compared to that in Figure 12. We refer to this sponge-phase fraction as weakly
hydrated spongosomes. The uneven distribution of the material yielded
also nanosponges encapsulating oil-like nanodomains enriched in EPA
(Figure 13d). Therefore,
(i) swollen nanosponges with large aqueous channels, (ii) weakly hydrated
sponges, and (iii) spongosomes encapsulating EPA nanodomains can be
formed under the conditions of excess EPA fraction in the amphiphilic
mixture. Higher EPA quantities in the mixtures may be expected to
lead to phase separation of microscopic oil-phase fractions.

images of weakly hydrated spongosomes (a, b) and of sponge-phase
nanocarriers with high density of aqueous channels (c, d) in the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 system (MO/EPA ratio 30:70). The dense droplet in image
(d) likely corresponds to an EPA-rich nanodomain encapsulated in the
nanosponge of a mixed composition.

All samples in the present work were prepared at pH 7. The
pH sensitivity
of the mixed EPA/MO lipid assemblies was out of the scope of our study.
Nevertheless, this topic is of considerable interest for applications
employing stimulus-responsive nanocarriers.13,34,55−57 It is known that the
pKa of unsaturated fatty acids in lipidic
or protein environment is shifted with regard to the pKa of the carboxyl (COOH) groups in aqueous solution phase.104−106 Depending on the experimental system, the pH for the onset of interfacial
ionization of the COOH groups needs to be particularly examined, as
it depends on the fatty acid chain length, unsaturation, and the concentration
and type of the counterions in the aqueous phase. Although the pKa is about 5 for carboxyl groups in a bulk aqueous
solution, this value can be substantially higher for interfacially
exposed COOH groups. Owing to the lower dielectric constant of the
lipid headgroup environment,107 the pKa value is about 7 for COOH groups in the interfacial
region.104,105 The apparent pKa for the PUFAs106 is close to the physiological
pH. Under these conditions, the ionization state may influence the
critical packing parameter (CPP) of the lipid mixtures in which PUFA
is involved. Previous reports55 have exploited
the fact that the increase of pH may decrease the CPP of the amphiphilic
assemblies owing to the ionization of the headgroups. Although pH
was not varied in our system, the obtained structural results indicated
a transition to less curved membrane structures at higher PUFA content,
which is associated with the decreased hydration of the lipid/water
interfaces and the sizes of the aqueous compartments. These effects
might be related to the ionization state of the EPA headgroups at
the lipid membrane interfaces and require future work toward the design
of controlled release nanoassemblies.

Conclusions
In
this work, we obtained new knowledge about the structural properties
of the ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid EPA at microscopic and
nanoscale levels. Whereas ω-3 PUFAs present strong interest
as bioactive lipids, the established self-assembly behavior of EPA
revealed that it requires colipids or coamphiphiles for the formation
of stable liquid crystalline nanoparticulate dispersions of therapeutic
significance. The performed SAXS investigation resolved intermediate
states induced upon composition-mediated curvature changes in the
self-assembled membranes with MO. A phase transition from a periodic
to a random organization of the EPA-embedding lipid membranes was
detected. The cryo-TEM imaging established that the encapsulation
of EPA strongly influences the inner liquid crystalline organization
of the carriers at the nanoscale. The multiarchitecture assemblies
comprise topological features of double membrane vesicles, cubosomes,
spongosomes, and their precursors. Inhomogeneous membrane curvature
distribution was observed at elevated molar fractions of EPA. Bicompartment
nano-objects with joint vesicle and oil compartments were also found
as a function of the MO/EPA molar ratio. Highly swollen spongosomes
and weakly hydrated nanosponges were produced with the investigated
MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 systems depending on the experimental
conditions.

In our opinion, an interesting result for future
therapeutic applications
might be the stealth spongosomes and nanosponges formed at an MO/EPA
ratio 30:70 (mol/mol). They contain a large fraction of bioactive
lipid (ω-3 PUFA) with regard to the helper lipid (MO). In perspective,
it may be considered that the structural organization of such hydrated
lipid sponges may be suitable for preparation of nanocarriers combining
water-insoluble and water-soluble drugs in their multicompartment
architecture.

Experimental Section
Materials and Sample Preparation
cis-5,8,11,14,17-Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5,
EPA) and 1-monooleoyl-rac-glycerol (MO) [C18:1c9,
MW 356.54, powder, purity 99.5%]
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (France). The PEGylated phospholipid
1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(methoxy(poly(ethylene glycol))-2000) ammonium salt (DOPE-PEG2000) (MW 2801.51 g/mol) was purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids
(Coger, Paris, France). A phosphate buffer solution (NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4, 1 × 10–2 M, pH 7, p.a. grade, Merck) was prepared using Milli-Q water (Millipore
Co.). It contained small amounts of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT).

Bulk phases and dispersed liquid crystalline carriers
were obtained by the method of hydration of a dry lipid film followed
by physical agitation. Chloroform solutions of MO and EPA were mixed
at varying ratios of 90:10, 85:15, 80:20, 70:30, 50:50, 40:60, and
30:70 (mol/mol). The phospholipid DOPE-PEG2000 was added
(2 mol % with regard to MO) in the amphiphilic mixtures, which required
dispersion into nanovehicles. After mixing of the lipid components,
the solvent was evaporated from the MO/EPA and the MO/EPA/DOPE-PEG2000 samples under a gentle stream of nitrogen gas to obtain
fine and homogeneous lipid films, which were lyophilized overnight.
The hydration of the mixed lipid layers was performed by incubation
with a BHT-containing phosphate buffer solution at room temperature.
Bulk phases were self-assembled in 60 wt % aqueous phase. Nanoparticulate
dispersions were obtained in 95 wt % excess aqueous phase by vortexing
and agitation in an ice bath. Ultrasonic cycles with a total duration
of about 20 min (Branson 2510 ultrasonic bath, “set sonics”
mode, power 60 W) were performed. Filtration of the dispersions through
0.2 μm pore-sized microporous membrane filters (Minisart High
Flow, Sartorius) was performed under a laminar flow hood.

Synchrotron
SAXS
Synchrotron SAXS experiments were
performed at the P12 BioSAXS beamline108 of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) at the storage
ring PETRA III of the Deutsche Elektronen Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg,
Germany) at 20 °C using a Pilatus 2M detector (1475 pixels ×
1679 pixels) (Dectris, Switzerland) and synchrotron radiation with
a wavelength λ = 1 Å. The sample-to-detector distance was
3 m, allowing for measurements in the q-range interval
from 0.01 to 0.44 Å–1. The q-vector was defined as q = (4π/λ)sin θ,
where 2θ is the scattering angle. The q-range
was calibrated using the diffraction patterns of silver behenate.
The experimental data were normalized with respect to the transmitted
beam intensity and corrected for nonhomogeneous detector response.
The background scattering of the quartz capillary and the aqueous
buffer was subtracted. The aqueous buffer scattering was measured
before and after every sample scattering to control for eventual sample
holder contamination. Twenty consecutive frames (each of 0.05 s) comprising
the measurements for the sample and the solvent were acquired. No
measurable radiation damage was detected by the comparison of the
frames. The final scattering curve was obtained using the program
PRIMUS by averaging the scattering data collected from the different
frames. An automatic sample changer adjusted for sample volume of
20 μL and a filling cycle of 1 min was used.

Cryogenic Transmission
Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM)
For cryo-TEM studies, a sample
droplet of 2 μL was put on a
lacey carbon film-covered copper grid (Science Services, Munich, Germany),
which was hydrophilized by glow discharge (Solarus, Gatan, Munich,
Germany) for 30 s. Most of the liquid was then removed with blotting
paper, leaving a thin film stretched over the lace holes. The specimen
was instantly shock frozen by rapid immersion into liquid ethane and
cooled to approximately 90 K by liquid nitrogen in a temperature-and-humidity-controlled
freezing unit (Leica EMGP, Wetzlar, Germany). The temperature and
humidity were monitored and kept constant in the chamber during all
sample preparation steps. The specimen was inserted into a cryo transfer
holder (CT3500; Gatan, Munich, Germany) and transferred to a Zeiss
EM922 Omega energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) instrument (Carl Zeiss Microscopy,
Jena, Germany). Examinations were carried out at temperatures around
90 K. The TEM instrument was operated at an acceleration voltage of
200 kV. Zero-loss-filtered images (DE = 0 eV) were taken under reduced
dose conditions (100–1000 e/nm2). The images were
recorded digitally by a bottom-mounted charge-coupled device camera
system (Ultra Scan 1000; Gatan, Munich, Germany) and combined and
processed with a digital imaging processing system (Digital Micrograph
GMS 1.9; Gatan, Munich, Germany). The sizes of the investigated nanoparticles
were in the range or below the film thickness, and no deformations
were observed. The images were taken very close to focus or slightly
under the focus (some nanometers) due to the contrast enhancing capabilities
of the in-column filter of the employed Zeiss EM922 Omega. In EFTEMs,
deep underfocused images can be totally avoided.

Polarized Optical
Microscopy (POM)
Thin films of bulk
liquid crystalline phase samples were studied under cross polarizers
by POM using cells of two cover glass slides inserted in a temperature-controlled
stage. The experimental setup included a microscope Nikon Eclipse
E600 equipped with a polarizer and a Mightex Buffer USB camera (Mightex
Systems). Objectives with magnifications of 10×, 20×, and
40× were employed.

Quasielastic Light Scattering (QELS)
The particle sizes
in the investigated lipid dispersions were determined using a Nanosizer
apparatus (Nano-ZS90; MALVERN) equipped with a helium–neon
laser of 633 nm wavelength. The nanocarriers were suspended in a buffer
solution in 1 cm thick cells and analyzed in a manual mode using the
following experimental parameters: temperature, 25 °C; scattering
angle, 90°; refracting index, 1.33; and environment medium viscosity,
0.890 cP. The average hydrodynamic diameter, dh, was calculated considering the mean translational diffusion
coefficient, D, of the particles in accordance with
the Stokes–Einstein law for spherical particles in the absence
of interactions: dh = kBT/3ηπD,
where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature, and η is the viscosity of the
aqueous medium. The results were analyzed using MALVERN Zetasizer
software. The particle distribution by size was expressed in the “volume”
analysis configuration after averaging three measurements with the
same sample. The plotted maximal intensities correspond to the mean
nano-object sizes, which are most abundant in the sample volume.
