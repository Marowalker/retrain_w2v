1 Introduction
Hydrogels are cross-linked
networks of hydrophilic polymer chains
capable of imbibing large amount of water.1−10 The supramolecular hydrogels, formed by low-molecular-weight gelators
have gained tremendous interest due to their profound implications
in tissue engineering, controlled release of bioactive substances,
sensing, catalysis, targeted drug delivery, and in optoelectronics.1−10 Low-molecular-weight gelators assemble via noncovalent interactions
like π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and charge
interactions into various entangled networks such as fibers, tapes,
tubes, helices, etc.1−10 The properties of the hydrogels can be tuned by changing the external
stimuli, such as pH, temperature, ionic strength, or variation in
concentration of their components. Several natural products like amino
acids, peptides,7,11−13 fatty acids,14−16 sugars,5 and nucleobases, nucleosides, and nucleotides,17,18 have been used as ideal building blocks for supramolecular gels.
In an early report, a nucleobase analogue lithium urate was used as
an efficient low-molecular-weight hydrogelator.19 Since then, nucleobases have been functionalized and derivatized
by several groups to explore their gelation abilities.20 Guanosine 1, a natural nucleoside,
is an important low-molecular-weight building block for supramolecular
hydrogels due to its unique self-assembly properties. This nucleoside
containing the natural nucleobase purine provides multiple edges for
hydrogen-bonding interactions. The self-complementary hydrogen-bonding
donors (N1 amide and N2 amino) and acceptors (N7, N3 and O6) enable
guanosine and its derivatives to self-assemble into dimers, ribbons,
sheets, or macrocycles via noncanonical base pairing.21−29 Most of the guanosine-based hydrogels are based on the supramolecular
assembly of macrocyclic G-quartet units. This macrocyclic structure
generates a central cavity where four carbonyl oxygens (O6) provide
potential sites for cation coordination (typically Na+,
K+),21−29 thus providing cation-induced stability to the columnar aggregates
of G-quartets that immobilize significant amount of water to form
hydrogel (Figure 1).
The G-quartet motif is the basic building block of biologically relevant
DNA30 and RNA31 G-quadruplexes present in the telomeres, promoter regions as well
as the untranslated regions of mRNAs of several proto-oncogenes.32−34

derivatives.

In addition, the biocompatible
and biodegradable properties of
guanosine 1 and its derivatives provide a diverse toolbox
in biomedicinal research, particularly in the field of intracellular
delivery of drug molecules. More importantly, the ease of synthetic
derivatization of guanosine enables tuning the functionality and variability
of guanosine-derived supramolecular hydrogels.

2 Mechanical
Insights and Characterization of
Guanosine-Based Hydrogels
The hydrogelation of guanosine
is a multistep hierarchical nucleation
process that drives sol-to-gel transitions. The gelation procedure
involves heating a solution of guanosine or its derivatives to dissolve
the gelator and subsequent cooling of the homogeneous solution to
form a metastable state that does not free flow, generating self-supported
hydrogel. In this heating-and-cooling process, guanosine bases can
associate through Hoogsteen type hydrogen bonding to form square planar
aromatic G-quartet structures that stack upon one another and grow
into G-wires. The physical cross-linking, branching, and lateral aggregation
of G-wires drive the gelation process. The gel network can be easily
broken down by disrupting the supramolecular assemblies using appropriate
external stimuli. Owing to this reversible nature, guanosine-based
hydrogels have been considered as stimuli responsive “smart”
biomaterials.

The gelation mechanisms and properties of the
guanosine-based hydrogels
have been established by various characterization techniques. NMR35−50 spectroscopy, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS),35,45 matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)
mass spectrometry,39,49 and IR spectroscopy37,47−50 have been widely used for structure elucidation and identification
of the supramolecular assemblies present in the guanosine hydrogel.
The NMR spectroscopy has been used to predict the structural properties
of the constituents and the resulting aggregates involved in gel formation.
In the solution-phase 1H NMR, the gelators, which take
part in the formation of gel fibers, cannot be detected because of
line broadening and loss of spectral resolution. This principle has
been used to determine the relative content of gelators in the gel
network.35−50 Variable temperature NMR (VT-NMR) experiments have been used to
study the thermal responsiveness of the self-assembled fibers.43,49,51 An upfield shift in peak positions
and decrease in integral values of the peaks, as gelation proceeds
with decrease in temperature (from melting temperature of gel to room
temperature) have been observed in VT-NMR analysis of the guanosine
gel samples.49,51 The magic-angle-spinning (MAS)
NMR has been used to identify the component crucial for gelation as
well as provide information about the stacking interaction of G-quartets
in the gel network.43,52 Diffusion ordered NMR spectroscopy
(DOSY) is used to characterize gelators of various sizes based on
their self-diffusion coefficients (Dt).431H double-quantum MAS spectroscopy
is a useful technique to distinguish between G-ribbons and G-quartet
in the supramolecular assemblies of guanosine.43 Other techniques like solid-phase NMR and two-dimensional
NMR spectroscopy have also been used for structure elucidation of
various guanosine gels. Solid-state magic-angle-spinning (MAS) 11B NMR spectroscopy confirms the presence of borate diesters
in the guanosine borate hydrogels, as reported by Davis group.43 ESI-MS and MALDI-TOF further confirm the components
present in the gel network. IR spectroscopy gives an insight into
the presence of functional groups in the gel network.

Several
other techniques have also been used to characterize the
supramolecular architecture within the gel system. The X-ray techniques
reveal the structural motifs and physical properties of the supramolecular
architectures in the guanosine gels. Small-angle X-ray scattering
(SAXS) is used to determine the length of the structures in the nanometer
to micrometer range and indicates the repeat distances of the gel
fibers.41,43,53 Small-angle
neutron scattering (SANS) also characterizes the shape, size, and
dimensions of the gel fibers.39,43,53 SANS and SAXS data from various reports on guanosine-derived gels
suggest that the average dimension of the guanosine gel fibers is
in the nanometer range and highly dependent on the dimensions of the
component guanosine units. For instance, whereas the gel fibers in
the binary hydrogel derived from 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetylguanosine and guanosine have a radius of 1.47 nm
and a length of 32 nm,39 the guanosine
borate hydrogel fibers are 2.15 nm in radius and 46 nm in length.43 It has also been inferred from the SANS studies
that the core of the fibers is comprised of the G-quartets formed
by the guanine bases and the shell region is comprised of the ribose
units.43 The size distribution profile
of the supramolecular gels and the thickness of the gel fibers can
also be studied using dynamic light scattering measurements.44,51 Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) studies have been used to confirm
the π–π stacking interactions between the successive
G-quartet stacks within the guanosine hydrogel.46,49−51 The PXRD analysis of the dry guanosine hydrogels
shows a broad peak at 26.8°, which corresponds to the distance
between two adjacent vertical G-quartet stacks (d = 0.33 nm). The presence of G-quartet stacks in the gel fibers is
also evident from the UV–vis absorption spectroscopy.41

Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy provides
key insights into
the stereostructure of the supramolecular assembly of the gelator
molecules.40−46,48−50,52 Positive peaks at 254 and 295 nm and negative peaks
at 236 and 270 nm in the CD spectrum indicate both head-to-tail and
head-to-head stacking of the G-quartets in the gel fibers. Parallel
and antiparallel arrangements of the G-quartets in the gel fibers
induced by the stabilizing cation can also be monitored using the
CD spectroscopy.49,52 Whereas CD spectroscopy throws
light upon the orientation of the G-quartet stacks within the gel
framework, several microscopic techniques have been used to visualize
the microscopic structures of the self-assembled systems. Scanning
electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) have been used to investigate the morphology
of the gel sample.35−56 The microscopic images of these hydrogels reveal that the gel matrix
is composed of a highly entangled three-dimensional network of ribbon-
or fiberlike structures of variable width and length. A change in
the appearance of these fibers on changing the stabilizing cation
or the guanosine derivative can also be monitored by these techniques.
For instance, it has been recently reported by our group that whereas
the AFM image of the guanosine–phenylboronic acid hydrogel
stabilized by K+ ions exhibits an entangled network of
knotted fibers, the guanosine–phenylboronic acid hydrogel stabilized
by Pb2+ ions displays comparatively straight fibers that
were not very interlinked.49 Confocal laser
scanning microscopy is also helpful for imaging the incorporation
of dyes into fibrous gel network.51

Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)39,49,51 and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)49 indicate the thermal stabilities of the hydrogels.
The DSC studies determine the gelation temperature (Tgel), whereas the TGA studies provide the thermal degradation
profile of the hydrogels. Tgel for various
reported guanosine hydrogels vary within 50–80 °C and
stronger gels show a higher Tgel compared
to the weaker gels. Rheological experiments reveal the strength of
the hydrogel in the presence of stress and strain.39−41 The strength
of the guanosine gels are measured by monitoring their storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli
under varying conditions like shear stress, shear strain, and frequency.

3 Cation-Stabilized Guanosine Hydrogels
In 1910, Bang
et al. reported that concentrated 5′-guanosine
monophosphate (5′-GMP) 2 solution in water formed
gelatinous aggregates.57 After a few decades,
Gellert et al. in 1962 discovered that the G-quartet (G4) is the basic
structural unit of these hydrogel fibers.58 These findings established that guanosine derivatives can drive
hydrogelation through the stacking assembly of tetrameric G4 units
in the presence of a stabilizing cations. Numerous studies have shown
the role of cations and pH in the stabilization of guanosine hydrogels.

Sreenivasachary and Lehn used dynamic combinatorial chemistry to
construct thermodynamically stable G-quartet hydrogels (Figure 2).35 A dynamic combinatorial library consisting of hydrazides and aldehydes
yielded the most stable acylhydrazone hydrogel in the presence of
cations by selecting the optimum aldehyde component 5 and guanosine hydrazide 3. The guanosine-5′-hydrazide
hydrogel network was found to be capable of incorporating and releasing
biologically active and volatile molecules,36,37 such as acyclovir, vitamin C, vancomycin, fragrant aldehydes, and
ketones via reversible acylhydrazone bond formation. Thus, this hydrogel
system may find useful applications in developing drug delivery vehicles
as well as in fragrance-releasing commercial gels. Lehn’s group
also reported a dynamic hydrogel system using a guanine dimer 7 that could undergo cyclic sol–gel transitions on
reversible uptake and release of K+ ions.38 The bis-guanine gelator 7 formed stable gels
in the presence of K+ ions (Figure 3). The gel-to-sol transition was achieved
by addition of a cryptand that could pull out K+ from the
G-quartet hydrogel network. Upon protonation, the cryptand released
K+ ions, enabling the regeneration of gel. This dynamic
gel–sol interconversion demonstrated the effective role of
K+ ions in stabilizing G-quartet formation in the gel network,
and it also indicated the stimuli-responsive nature of the guanosine
hydrogelation systems.

Figure 2 Dynamic combinatorial library consisting of guanosine-derived
acylhydrazones.

Figure 3 Guanosine derivatives
(7–9) used
for the preparation of stable hydrogels.

However, low shelf-life due to precipitation of gel components
and requirement of high concentration of stabilizing cations were
found to be the major drawbacks of most of the guanosine-derived hydrogels.
To overcome these limitations and to form stable gels with modulable
properties, two-component (binary) gel systems were developed. In
the binary gel systems, the use of two different guanosine derivatives
increased the gel stability by hindering the crystallization of gel
components.

The McGown group reported a two-component hydrogel
system using
hydrophobic guanosine 1 (gelator) and hydrophilic 5′-GMP 2 (nongelator) in the presence of K+ ions.54 They highlighted that the greater solubility
of 5′-GMP (in water) over guanosine 1 was the
prime factor for gelation. Depending on the ratio of the two components
in the gel medium, the gel exhibited thermoassociative and thermodissociative
behavior. To further enhance the stability and biocompatibility of
the gels, the Rowan group used a combination of guanosine 1 and its acetyl derivative 2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetylguanosine 8 to prepare clear hydrogels
with a longer shelf-life (Figure 3).39,53 They have further reported that
the use of 8-methoxy-2′,3′,5′-tri-O-acetylguanosine 9 as the other component along with
guanosine 1 formed hydrogels at lower salt concentrations,
establishing the fact that guanosine in its syn conformation as in 9 was more prone to self-assembly (Figure 3).40 In addition,
these guanosine-based gels were able to sustain cell growth and proliferation
without inducing significant apoptosis, suggesting their promising
applications in tissue engineering and tissue scaffolding. The same
group further reported that guanosine-derived polymers can be used
to improve the mechanical properties of the supramolecular hydrogels.55

During the same time, our group reported
that guanosine 1 and 8-bromoguanosine 10 can form a binary hydrogel
system (G–BrG hydrogel) within a wide range of their ratio
compositions (Figure 4).51 Significantly, a binary mixture of 1 and 10 formed stable and transparent hydrogels,
whereas the individual components form weak and unstable hydrogels.
A VT-NMR study of the hydrogel showed that 10 was a better
gelator compared to 1. The resulting hydrogel itself
did not show any birefringence but exhibited a birefringence in the
presence of dyes; thus the gel system might find potential applications
in optical devices and biomolecular imaging. Furthermore, organic
dyes like rose bengal, rhodamine 6G, and fluorescein were efficiently
diffused into the binary gel network through noncovalent stacking
interactions. Moreover, the hydrogel system was able to release dyes
in a controlled manner from the gel network. Such guanosine-based
hydrogels can be used for dye removal as well as in drug delivery
applications, as these gels can reversibly incorporate aromatic small
molecules. Self-assembly of guanosine and deoxyguanosine has also
been reported to form stable hydrogels with self-healing properties.56 Although various binary guanosine hydrogels
have been designed to form stable and biocompatible hydrogels, little
attention has been focused on their practical applications.

Figure 4 Formation of
G–BrG binary hydrogel that exhibits birefringent
properties in the presence of dyes.

Mann and co-workers reported that a silver (Ag) ion mediated
5′-GMP 2 gel could be finely tuned by modulating
the 5′-GMP-to-Ag
molar ratios.41 This Ag/5′-GMP gel
system could be used as molecular sensors, as the fibrillar network
of this hydrogel was capable of binding cationic dyes such as methylene
blue and Hoechst-33258. It was also reported that the protein molecules
such as cytochrome C could be immobilized within the Ag/5′-GMP
hydrogels without any loss of enzymatic activity. This work demonstrated
that small-molecule drugs and protein molecules can be incorporated
within the gel network.

Recently, our group reported that carbon
dots (G-dots) derived
from Na25′-GMP could form a fluorescent hydrogel
system.42 These nanosized G-dots were prepared
from Na25′-GMP under microwave irradiation and exhibited
photoluminescent properties. A detailed characterization using various
spectroscopic techniques showed that the G-dots were composed of 5′-GMP-polymers
of variable length. Interestingly, the G-dots could utilize the self-assembly
property of 5′-GMP to form fluorescent hydrogels without any
externally added monopositive cations. The TEM analysis of the dispersed
hydrogel showed the presence of fibrillar structures in the G-dot
hydrogel. This example illustrated that guanosine-derived nanomaterials
can undergo super-assembly to form fluorescent hydrogels that may
find prospective applications in biomedical engineering.

4 Anion-Stabilized Guanosine Hydrogels
Recently, the Davis
group developed an elegant approach for the
synthesis of a novel guanosine hydrogel system stabilized by borate
anion (Figure 5).43,52 On reaction with boric acid (H3BO3) in the
presence of KOH, guanosine 1 formed covalent borate monoester 11 and diastereomeric diesters (12 and 13). These borate esters self-assembled in the presence of
K+ ions to form hydrogels that were found to be more stable
than previously reported binary gel analogues. This study elucidated
the application of the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyl groups of
guanosine’s ribose moiety for the modulation of the self-assembly
of stacked G4s. The columnar G4 stacks laterally associated to form
cation templated entangled fibers. The borate anions solubilize guanosine
and stabilize the gel at physiological salt concentration, whereas
the K+ ions stabilized the G-quartet as well as the anionic
borate diesters, making it suitable for biological applications. Various
techniques such as PXRD, SANS, and rheology were employed to characterize
the hydrogels. The VT-NMR studies showed that the gels formed in the
presence of K+ ions were stronger than those formed in
the presence of other cations (Na+, Li+, Rb+, Cs+, etc.). These results suggested that the
physical properties of guanosine borate hydrogels can be modulated
by varying the borate salt.

Figure 5 Formation of guanosine borate hydrogel.

Significantly, the anionic hydrogel
could selectively incorporate
nucleosides via exchange reactions of boron-diol covalent bonds and
hydrogen bonding. The gel could also incorporate G-quadruplex DNA
interacting dyes by using both electrostatic and stacking interactions.
The G-quadruplex-binding molecules are mostly planar aromatic small
molecules that readily stack upon the G4 units.59 These small molecules are considered as potential anticancer
drugs that act by telomere maintenance60 and regulation of oncogene expression.61 The G-quadruplex interacting dyes methylene blue and thioflavin
T (ThT) were shown to bind to the gel network. The nonfluorescent
ThT dye displayed enhanced fluorescence upon interaction with the
G4 units of the hydrogel. These properties make the hydrogel system
attractive for the delivery of quadruplex targeting anticancer drugs.

They further demonstrated that weak guanosine borate hydrogels
formed in the presence of Li+ ions could be strengthened
by using a G-quadruplex interacting small molecule dye, ThT (Figure 6).44 In the presence of Li+ ions, guanosine tended
to form ribbonlike aggregates and generate weak gel. ThT stabilized
the stacking interaction of Li+-stabilized G4s and made
the gel more strong. 1H NMR spectroscopy in liquid state
showed that ThT could speed up the self-assembly process of the Li+ gel.

Figure 6 Schematic representation of thioflavin T (ThT) acting
as a molecular
chaperone for stabilizing the Li+ gel.

They further established that not only ThT but also other
planar
aromatic molecules like thiazole orange, methylene blue, crystal violet,
methylene violet, etc. were capable of stiffening the weak Li+ hydrogel. The rheological studies of Li+ gels
in the presence of different cationic dyes showed that crystal violet
was found to be more effective in stabilizing the gel network. These
observations suggested that G-quadruplex binding ligands could be
utilized as molecular chaperones facilitating the formation of long-lived
G-quartet-based hydrogel assembly. This study revealed that ligand
or additives could modulate the structure and properties of supramolecular
gels. It has also opened up a new strategy for the identification
of high-affinity DNA G-quadruplex binding ligands by using Li+-ion-stabilized guanosine borate hydrogels.

Davis’s
group also demonstrated a self-destructive hydrogel
system by using 5′-deoxy-5′-iodoguanosine 14 with a good leaving group like iodide at 5′ position as the
gelator.45 Iodoguanosine 14 upon heating at 90 °C in the presence of boric acid and KOH
for a few seconds formed a self-supporting transparent hydrogel due
to the formation of the borate ester 15. However, on
prolonged heating, no gelation was observed as compound 15 was converted to cycloguanosine borate ester 16 by
intramolecular cyclization. The cyclization occurred via displacement
of 5′-iodide by guanosine N3 and deprotonation of N1H. The
cycloguanosine borate ester 16 lacked the N1 H-bonding
donor and was thus incompatible for inclusion in a G-quartet, disassembling
the gel network. Moreover, most of the iodoguanosine borate ester 15 was converted to cycloguanosine borate ester 16 after 72 h at 37 °C, destructing the gel into a viscous liquid
(Figure 7). This example
demonstrated that the gel’s own component could self-destruct
the gel through in situ chemical reaction in a time- and temperature-dependent
manner. The authors subsequently established that this self-destructive
gel system can incorporate guanosine-derived anti-human immunodeficiency
virus drugs acyclovir and ganciclovir. This iodoguanosine borate hydrogel
showed higher incorporation and enhanced drug release properties compared
to the previously reported cation-stabilized guanosine hydrogel system.36,37 This work gave a new dimension in designing biocompatible guanosine
hydrogel systems for drug-delivery applications.

Figure 7 Hydrogel undergoing self
destruction via an in situ chemical reaction.

Next, they developed a binary hydrogel composed of 8-aminoguanosine 17 and guanosine 1, stabilized by binary cations
(Figure 8).46 They presumed that the 8-amino group of 17 on protonation in the aqueous gel medium would provide
a cationic gel network suitable for anionic dye absorption. To increase
the positive charge density in the hydrogel matrix and enhance its
efficiency of absorbing anionic dyes, divalent cations such as (Ba2+, Sr2+, and Pb2+) were used as stabilizing
cations. It was observed that the binary gel stabilized by Ba2+ was comparatively stronger and exhibited a greater absorption
of the anionic dyes compared to the K+-stabilized gel.
The Ba2+-stabilized hydrogel exhibited a selective absorption
of the anionic dyes naphthol blue black and rose bengal over the cationic
dye safranin O. These results demonstrated that guanosine-derived
gels can be modulated to absorb both cationic52 and anionic46 dyes. Thus, guanosine hydrogels
can be used for the removal of pollutant dyes from wastewaters.

Figure 8 Binary hydrogel

The versatility of the guanosine boronate ester hydrogel
could
be utilized for advanced applications. Inspired from the borate ester
hydrogels, Shi et al. fabricated a multicomponent stimuli responsive
hydrogel system for controlled release of drugs at a constant rate
(Figure 9). In this
study, the G-quartet hydrogel was prepared from a mixture composed
of guanosine 1, 2-formylphenylboronic acid 18 and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine 19 in the presence of KCl.47 They proposed that gelation occurred due to
the synergistic formation of G-quartet (G4), boronate ester, and iminoboronate
linkage. The trifunctional amine 19 could connect adjacent
G-quartets via iminoboronate bonds. The iminoboronate bonds in the
hydrogel not only strengthened the gel but also made it responsive
toward acid and glucose stimuli; a property that was highly useful
for controlled release of drugs. The drug release studies were carried
out with two model drugs methylene blue and fluorescein isothiocyanate-lysozyme
and the release rates were measured using UV–vis and fluorescence
spectroscopy. Unlike other drug delivery systems, where a “fast
and then slow” release of drugs is observed, this gel system
exhibited a zero order controlled release of drugs in response to
stimuli like acid and glucose.

Figure 9 G-quartet hydrogels composed of guanosine,
boronic acid, and tris(2-aminoethyl)amine
exhibiting a zero order drug release in response to stimuli like glucose
and acid.

Venkatesh et al. incorporated
a photoactivatable dopamine-conjugated
platinum(IV) anticancer complex 20 into borate hydrogels
(Figure 10).48 This hydrogel (Pt–G4K+B) was prepared from Pt-dopamine conjugate 20, boric acid, guanosine, and potassium hydroxide in water. Unlike
other guanosine borate hydrogels, Pt–G4K+B hydrogel was brown in color and exhibited a flakelike morphology.
They showed that the hydrogel could induce selective cytotoxicity
toward cisplatin-resistant A2780C human ovarian cancer cells over
the noncancerous human fibroblast cell line MRC-5 when irradiated
under blue light. This strategy designed for the delivery of photoactivatable
Pt(IV) anticancer complexes to cancer cells would be highly beneficial
for cancer treatment. In addition, the incorporation of the photoactive
platinum-based anticancer drugs in the hydrogel network would limit
the drug exposure to the external environment and facilitate the slow
release of the drug specifically at the target site on exposure to
light stimuli. This approach would be helpful for developing a new
class of photochemotherapeutic agents with the potential for localized
immunogenic treatment of cancers.

dopamine-conjugated
platinum(IV) anticancer complex.

Very recently, our group utilized this concept of guanosine
boronate
ester hydrogels for designing smart versatile materials for sensing
and biomolecular logic operations (Figure 11).49 We used
guanosine 1 and boronic acids to prepare hydrogels in
the presence of KOH. A variety of aryl, heteroaryl, and aliphatic
boronic acids 22a–h were used to
prepare the gels. The detailed characterization of the guanosine–phenylboronic
acid hydrogel (G–PhB hydrogel) showed that the gel fibers were
composed of G-quartet units resembling the G-quadruplex-like arrangements.30−34 Although the G-rich sequences were known to fold into G-quadruplexes
in the presence of various mono- and divalent cations like Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ba2+, Zn2+, Mg2+, Pb2+, or Sr2+,62,63 the guanosine−phenylboronic acid
(G−PhB) hydrogel is selectively formed in the presence of K+ and Pb2+ ions.

Figure 11 Guanosine-boronate ester hydrogels for
sensing and biomolecular
logic operations.

Spectroscopic studies
suggested that the conformation of supramolecular
assembly of the hydrogel could be altered by changing the stabilizing
cation. Interestingly, the K+-stabilized guanosine–phenylboronic
acid (G–PhB) hydrogel on binding with hemin exhibited a DNAzyme-like
peroxidase activity,64−71 promoting the oxidation of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
in the presence of H2O2. This study demonstrated
that guanosine-derived hydrogels can mimic enzymatic activity. However,
the Pb2+-stabilized G–PhB hydrogel did not show
such activity, as the hemin failed to bind the Pb2+ gel
network. This differential activity was used to efficiently detect
nanomolar concentrations of lead ions, thus providing a sensing system
for toxic Pb2+ ions. Further, an INHIBIT logic gate was
developed by monitoring the enzyme-mimicking activity of the hydrogel–hemin
complex using K+ and Pb2+ as two inputs. As
boronic acids with various functionalities can be introduced into
the gel matrix, this approach offered a versatile material platform
for generating hydrogels with tunable elastic properties for diverse
applications. For instance, drug molecules derivatized with boronic
acid functional group could be incorporated into the gel matrix and
used for developing the next-generation drug delivery technologies.
Moreover, dynamic combinatorial libraries72−74 can be constructed
using guanosine and different boronic acids to generate stable gels
for understanding the fundamental aspects of self-organization process.

Another similar artificial enzymatic hydrogel system has been developed
by incorporating hemin into G-quartets during the cation-templated
self-assembly between guanosine, boric acid, and KOH.75 The gel system in the presence of the K+ stabilizing
ions bound hemin and showed peroxidase activity, whereas no peroxidase
activity was observed in the presence of Pb2+ ions. This
gel assembly had been utilized to construct two two-input INHIBIT
logic gates by employing K+ and Pb2+, or K+ and pH as inputs and also provided a sensor for Pb2+ ions.

The ditopic phenyl-1,4-diboronic acid has been used
to prepare
guanosine bis-boronate hydrogels in the presence of cations like K+ and Ba2+.50 The G-quartets
formed in K+-stabilized bis-boronate hydrogel could cross-link
with Mg2+ ions to generate a gel with a high water retention
capacity (Figure 12). The diboronic acid as the cross-linker enhanced the swelling property
of the gel in the presence of external stabilizing Mg2+ cations. These hydrogels, with a high water content was able to
sustain cell growth on the surface, showing negligible cell toxicity.

enhanced water retention property.

5 Scope and Future Directions
We herein highlight
the recent advances in guanosine derivatives
with tunable self-assembling abilities that have been explored for
developing hydrogels for different applications. This provides new
opportunities for engineering more advanced guanosine-derived hydrogelators
and hybrid multicomponent hydrogel constructs useful for tissue-engineering
and other medicinal applications. However, some fundamental questions
still remain to be addressed. For instance, the potential loading
capacity and the stability of the incorporated drugs within the gel
network are yet to be studied. The guanosine borate hydrogel should
be optimized for controlled and more sophisticated responsiveness
toward chemical and biological stimuli. Simultaneously, the gel system
may need to be further improvised to build self-healing materials
by using dynamic and reversible supramolecular interactions. In addition,
the hydrogel systems could be useful for hydrophobic drug delivery
by incorporating poorly water-soluble drug molecules into the gel
network. The hydrogels could be used for the development of novel
biomaterials with enzyme-mimicking and catalytic activity. Guanosine-based
hydrogels can be exploited for biosensing and bioseparation by linking
different enzymes and DNAzymes for enzyme-triggered controllable release
of drug molecules at specific sites. Moreover, the guanosine hydrogel
can be applied for encapsulation of proteins, peptides, and peptide
derivatives that are promising adjuvants; thus, supramolecular hydrogels
can be useful for enhancing the potency of vaccines or cancer immunotherapeutics.
Moreover, different types of nanomaterials like nanoparticles, nanosheets,
nanotubes, and quantum dots can also be incorporated inside the fibrillar
matrices of guanosine-based hydrogels to formulate gel nanocomposites
that may have widespread applications in catalysis, optoelectronics,
and biomedicinal research. The gel nanocomposites can also be prepared
with biomaterials such as DNA, proteins, lipids, etc. to develop nanobiocomposites
having potential applications in gene therapy and anticancer treatment.
Guanosine hydrogel based magnetonanocomposites may be suitable for
targeted drug delivery in response to magnet stimuli. Recently, there
has been an urgent need to develop efficient antimicrobial agents
effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Guanosine gel-based
nanocomposites composed of different metal ions can provide useful
insights into the development of antibacterial hydrogels. Another
potential area that needs attention is the development of hydrogel
systems made from other nucleosides and different combination of nucleosides
by utilizing both canonical and noncanonical base pairing. Because
nucleosides are expected to have different coordination abilities
with different metal ions, they can be used to generate a wide variety
of hydrogels that would find promising applications in therapeutics
and medicinal research. The stimuli-controlled self-assembling property
of the hydrogel systems could be exploited to provide a platform for
devising gel-based biomolecular logic gates. The canonical and noncanonical
base-pairing abilities of different nucleosides and in-depth understanding
of the underlying principles of their self-assembly processes would
pave the way for the construction of advanced functional materials.
