Two new bromotyrosine
derivatives, anomoian B (1)
and aplyzanzine B (2), were isolated, respectively, from
the organic extracts of a Verongida sponge belonging to the Hexadella genus and from a two-sponge association
(Jaspis sp. and Bubaris sp.), both collected off the coast of Indonesia. The planar structure
of 1 and 2 was determined by 1D and 2D NMR
experiments and by high-resolution mass spectrometry, while their
absolute stereochemistry was assigned by comparison with optical rotation
values of known bromotyrosines and by chemical degradation. Both compounds
showed moderate antiproliferative activity against a panel of different
cancer cell lines. Their cytotoxic activity is facilitated through
the induction of apoptosis, which is mediated neither by the generation
of reactive oxygen species nor by the inhibition of histone deacetylases
in these cell lines.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Marine
sponges belonging to the order Verongida are devoid of spicules,
and their characterization is a real challenge in terms of taxonomy.1 However, the bromotyrosine derivatives that are
distinctive of this type of sponges2 have
been used as chemotaxonomic markers and have been proved to be a useful
tool to facilitate taxonomic identification.3 Since the first report of (+)-aeroplysinin-1,3 marine sponges of the order Verongida have been found to
produce many bromotyrosine derivatives such as aerothionin,4 purealidins,5,6 purpurealidins,7 purpuramines,6,8 aplysamines,3 pseudoceralidinone A,9 and purealines.10 Despite this, Verongida
is not the only order of sponges where bromotyrosine derivatives have
been found. Two-sponge associations, where at least one of the members
belongs to the genus Jaspis, are also
known to contain this kind of metabolites.11

From an ecological point of view, this type of compounds has
evolved
as a defense system against natural predators, with the exception
of some nudibranchs and mollusks that can feed on these sponges.12

Some of these alkaloids have been described
as antiproliferative, apolipoprotein E modulators
or cytotoxic and antibacterial
agents.2 Previous studies of their molecular
mechanism of action revealed that psammaplin13,14 is an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), whereas the small
bromotyrosine derivatives15 are potent
apoptotic effectors.

2 Results and Discussion
In the course of our ongoing drug discovery program to find new
antitumor agents from marine sponges,16,17 extracts of
two Indonesian samples were fractionated, guided by their cytotoxic
activities, leading to the isolation of two new bromotyrosine derivatives.
The first sample, an unknown species of the genus Hexadella (order Verongida) collected at Para Island in Indonesia, was extracted,
and the soluble materials were subjected to reversed-phase chromatography
to yield anomoian B (1, 0.037%, wet wt) as a colorless,
amorphous solid together with the known bromotyrosine alkaloid aplysamine
4 (3) (Chart 1).14 Previous chemical studies
of marine sponges of the genus Hexadella reported the isolation of bromotyrosine derivatives related to aerothionin
and bisindole alkaloids.19−21

The second sample, a two-sponge
association of Jaspis sp. and Bubaris sp. collected in
Pulau Saujung in Indonesia, was extracted to give an organic extract,
which after bioguided fractionation yielded aplyzanzine B (2, 0.057%, wet wt) as a brown amorphous solid. Although there are
earlier reports of chemical studies of Jaspis genus sponges associated with another sponge genus,11 this work constitutes the first study of a two-sponge association
of Jaspis sp. and Bubaris sp. As far as we know, there is a just one chemical study of a sponge
belonging to Bubaris genus that describes
the isolation of a sesquiterpenoid isocyanide.22,23

Chart 1 The (+)-low-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectra
(LRESIMS)
data of 1 [[α]D + 10.5° (c 1.0, CH3OH)] showed the [M + H]+ ion as a cluster at m/z 740, 742,
744, 746, and 748 in a 1:4:6:4:1 ratio, indicating the presence of
four bromine atoms in the molecule. This was verified by subsequent
(+)-high-resolution electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry
(HRESITOFMS) of the first isotopic peak at m/z 739.9355 [M + H]+ (calcd for C25H3479Br4N3O3m/z 739.9328), which in combination
with its NMR data (Table 1) allowed us to propose the molecular formula of 1 as C25H33Br4N3O3.

Maximum UV absorptions at
276 and 284 nm indicated a possible substituted
benzoic system, whereas the diagnostic IR vibration at 1673 cm–1 suggested the presence of an amide carbonyl group.
The 13C NMR spectrum (see Table 1) disclosed signals owing to nine sp2 quaternary carbons including an amide (δC 167.2), four sp2 methines, one sp3 methine,
six sp3 methylenes, and five methyls.

Analysis of
the 1H–1H correlation
spectroscopy (COSY) along with the Distortionless Enhancement by Polarization
Transfer (DEPT)-135-edited heteronuclear single-quantum correlation
(HSQC) spectra of 1 revealed the presence of three spin
systems: (a) 2-aminoethyl (δC7 34.3/δH7 3.36/3.00 and δC8 70.5/δH8 3.91), (b) 3-aminopropanol (δC10 38.0/δH10 3.51/3.28, δC11 30.6/δH11 1.84/1.70, and δC12 71.6/δH12 3.87/3.75),
and (c) 2-aminoethyl (δC19 30.3/δH22 2.99 and δC20 59.1/δH23 3.33) (Figure 1A).
Additionally, singlets observed in the 1H NMR spectrum
of 1 were assigned to a methoxy group (δOMe 61.1/δOMe 3.77), two dimethylamino groups (δC21,22 42.5/δH21,22 2.99 and δC23,24 43.6/δH23,24 2.93), and four aromatic protons (δC2,6 135.2/δH2,6 7.51 and δC15,17 134.4/δH15,17 7.57, 2H each), characteristic of
two symmetrically dibromine-substituted aromatic rings. The three
spin systems and the other groups were connected by the aid of a heteronuclear
multiple-bond correlation (HMBC) experiment (see Figure 1A): (a) The methoxy group was
located at C4 of one of the dibromine aromatic rings by the HMBC correlation
between the Me25 protons at δH 3.77 and the quaternary
aromatic carbon C4 at δC 155.1. Furthermore, the
HMBC correlations between the aromatic protons H-2/6 and the C4 and
C7 carbons connected the aromatic ring to the spin system a; correlations between the dimethylamino protons H21/H22 at δH 2.99 and C8 at δC8 70.5 and between the
proton H8 at δH8 3.91 and the carbonyl amide C9 allowed
us to identify an N,N′-dimethylamino
4-methoxy-3,5-dibrominetyrosine unit, or “tyrosine”
fragment, in 1. (b) 3-Aminopropanol (spin b) was linked on one side to the former tyrosine fragment by an HMBC
correlation between the methylene H210 protons at δH 3.51/3.28 and the carbonyl amide C9 and on the other side
to the second dibromine-substituted aromatic ring by the key long-range
correlation between the methylene H212 at δH 3.87/3.75 and the aromatic oxygenated carbon C13 at δC 153.4. (c) Finally, the second 2-aminoethyl group (spin c) was connected on one side to the second dibromine-substituted
aromatic ring by HMBC correlations between the aromatic protons H15/H17
at δH 7.57 and the methylene carbon C19 (δC 30.3) and on the other side to the dimethylamino moiety through
the HMBC correlation between methyl protons H23/24 at δH 2.93 and the methylene carbon C20. These correlations allowed
us to identify an N,N′-dimethylamino-3,5-dibrominetyramine
unit (the “tyramine” fragment).

(2D) NMR correlations of compound 1. (B) (+)-HRESIMS

Nuclear Overhauser effect
(NOE) correlations between protons H2/6
and H7/8, H21/22 and H8, and H15/17 and H19/20 observed in a rotating-frame
Overhauser effect spectroscopy (ROESY) experiment of 1 were consistent with the proposed structure (Figure 1A). Moreover, the proposed planar structure
of 1 was further confirmed by the presence of diagnostically
important peaks at m/z 333.9432
and 319.9276 detected in the (+)-HRESIMS/MS experiment of 1 (Figure 1B), corresponding
to selective fragmentation arising from the loss of both the tyrosine
and tyramine fragments. All of this information allowed us to establish
the structure of 1, named anomoian B, as having a framework
(tyrosine)–(“3-aminopropanol”)–(tyramine),
similar to that found in the purpuramines.6,8

A similar approximation was chosen for the structure elucidation
of 2, namely, as aplyzanzine B. The molecular formula
of aplyzanzine B (2) was determined as C26H34Br4N3O4 based on the
[M + H]+ ion peak observed at m/z 767.9285 in its (+)-HRESITOF mass spectrum and on the
NMR data (Table 1).

The 1H and 13C NMR spectral data (Table 1) of 2 showed the presence of the same N,N′-dimethylamino-4-methoxy-3,5-dibrominetyrosine unit (spin a), a 3-aminopropanol entity (δC18 69.9/δH18 4.13, δC19 25.3/δH19 2.32,
and δC20 55.5/δH20 3.42) (spin c), a second dimethylamino group, and another symmetrically
dibromine-substituted aromatic ring as in 1. Furthermore,
the NMR spectra of 2 showed the presence of additional
diastereotopic methylene protons (δC10 54.9/δH10 5.06 and 4.19) (spin b), an N-methylamide group (δC26 37.6/δH26 2.75), and a ketone carbonyl group (δC 189.3) instead
of the second 2-aminoethyl group present in 1.

Key HMBC correlations allowed us to identify the presence of a
−N(Me)–CH2–CO– unit linked
to the N,N′-dimethylamino-4-methoxy-3,5-dibrominetyrosine
unit (tyrosine fragment) as follows:(1) HMBC cross peaks from the methylamide
protons at δH26 2.75 to the carbonyl amide carbon
C9 (δC 166.8) and the methylene carbon C10 (δC 54.9) and

(2) HMBC correlations from the diastereotopic
methylene protons H210 (δH 5.06 and 4.19)
(spin b) to the carbon C9 and the ketone carbonyl carbon
C11 (δC 189.3).



Moreover,
long-range correlations from the aromatic protons H13/17
to the ketone carbonyl carbon C11 allowed us to link the −N(Me)–CH2–CO– unit to the second dibromine aromatic ring
on the other side. Thus, an N-methylamino-3,5-dibrominetyramine
unit (tyramine fragment) was identified as a substructure of 2.

The second N,N′-dimethylamino
group was linked to the 3-aminopropanol unit (spin c)
by the HMBC correlations from methyl protons H23/24 at δH 2.88 to the methylene carbon C20 (δC 55.5).
Finally, spin c was in turn connected to the second dibromine
aromatic ring by the long-range correlations from the methylene protons
H218 (δH 4.13) and from the aromatic protons
H17/18 (δH 8.03) to the same aromatic carbon C15
(δC 157.0), completing the planar structure of compound 2 (Figure 2A).

Figure 2 A) Selected 2D NMR correlations of compound 2. (B)
(+)-HRESIMS of the fragments detected in a MS/MS experiment of 2.

Again, NOE correlations between
aromatic protons H2/6 and H7/8,
the methylamide protons H26 and H8, the diastereotopic methylene protons
H210 and aromatic protons H13/17, and the methylene protons
H220 and methyl protons H23/24 observed in a ROESY experiment
of 2 agreed with the proposed structure (Figure 2A). Furthermore, the fragmentation
pathway detected in the (+)-HRESIMS/MS experiment of 2, displayed in Figure 2B, confirmed the proposed planar structure for 2. In
this way, the structure of compound 2 was shown to have
a framework (tyrosine)–(tyramine)–(3-aminopropanol)
similar to that present in aplysamine 4 (3). This compound
was also isolated in this study and was identified by comparison of
its spectral data with those reported by Scheuer and co-workers for
aplysamine 4 (3)18 isolated
from the Verongida sponge Psammaplysilla purpurea.

The S absolute stereochemistry at C8 in
both compounds
was determined by comparing their [α]D values (+10.5°
for 1 and +47.5° for 2) to those of
similar compounds reported previously in the bibliography such as iso-anomoian ([α]D + 4.5°)12 and suberedamine A ([α]D +
19.5°),10 all containing an l-tyrosine residue. Bromotyrosines bearing a d-tyrosine moiety,
such as ianthesine A ([α]D – 118°) and
its degradation tyrosine derivative N,N-dimethyl-d-tyrosine ([α]D – 73°),25 have been reported to have a negative sign [α]D value.15 It is important to notice
that both compounds were subjected to high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) chiral analysis and just one peak was observed for each compound,
ruling out a possible racemization at C8 position during the isolation
and purification processes.

Aplyzanzine B (2) was
hydrolyzed at 150 °C under
acid conditions to afford bromotyrosines (S)-3,5-dibromo-N,N-dimethyltyrosine (4) and
(S)-3-(3,5-dibromo-4-methoxyphenyl)-2-(dimethylamino)propanoic
acid (5) (Figure 3), whose structures were deduced by NMR spectral data and
by (+)-HRESI mass spectra displaying molecular formulae of C12H15Br2NO3 and C11H13Br2NO3, respectively. The positive
[α]D optical rotation values of +31° and +33°
for 4 and 5, respectively, confirmed the
same absolute stereochemistry of C8 as established for 2. (R)-3,5-Dibromo-N,N-dimethyltyrosine was obtained previously by acid hydrolysis of ianthesine
A,25 whereas compound 5 was
reported as an intermediate in the synthesis of several bromotyrosine
derivatives.26,27

Figure 3 Compounds 4 and 5 obtained by hydrolysis
of 2.

Aplyzanzine B (1) and anomoian B (2)
exhibit significant cytotoxic activity against three human tumor cell
lines from different tissues: A549 (lung carcinoma), HT-29 (colorectal
adenocarcinoma), and MDA-MB-231 (breast adenocarcinoma). IC50 values for anomoian B (1) in these cell lines are 5.1,
3.2, and 5.3 μM. IC50 values for aplyzanzine B (2) are 6.1, 1.6, and 7.8 μM. The bromotyrosines 4 and 5 were also evaluated under the same conditions
as 2 with the aim of determining a structure–activity
relationship for this type of compounds. The lack of cytotoxic activity
showed by compounds 4 and 5 seems to indicate
that the rest of the molecule plays an important role in the cytotoxic
activity of compounds 1 and 2.

In
order to get some insights into the mechanism of action of the
cytotoxic activity of these compounds, a further study of cell death
induction was performed.

The data published by Su et al.15 indicated
that the cytotoxic activity of small bromotyrosine derivatives is
mediated through the induction of apoptosis, also known as programmed
cell death. During apoptosis, some proteins are cleaved by caspase-3
and they can be used as markers of cell death. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP-1) is a target of caspase-3, and its cleavage is considered
to be a hallmark of apoptosis. PARP-1 cleavage can be easily detected
by Western blot. In addition, the apoptotic program leads to DNA internucleosomal
fragmentation; histone H2AX becomes rapidly phosphorylated when DNA
is damaged (known as γH2AX) and plays an important role in the
execution of apoptosis. To investigate whether the antiproliferative
effect of aplyzanzine B (1) and anomoian B (2) was due to the induction of apoptosis, three human tumor cell lines
(the same ones in which cytotoxicity had been previously demonstrated,
namely, A549, HT-29, and MDA-MB-231) were incubated with both compounds
at 10 and 20 μg/mL for 24 h (also 48 h for A549).

HT-29
was the cell line with higher sensitivity to both compounds
at 24 h. Morphological alteration characteristic of apoptosis, such
as dense chromatin surrounded by a halo, was observed in the white-field
microscopy images (Figure 4). Protein analysis by Western blot confirmed that, in HT-29
cells, both aplyzanzine B (1) and anomoian B (2) exerted their antiproliferative effect through the induction of
apoptosis. Increasing concentrations of both compounds led to PARP
cleavage and γH2AX induction (Figure 5). It is important to notice that γH2AX
induction is not an effect of direct binding to DNA by these compounds.
Band-shift assays have shown that, after incubation with these compounds,
the electrophoretic migration of a 200 bp DNA fragment is not affected
(data not shown).

Figure 4 Images of human tumor cell lines HT-29, MDA-MB-231, and
A-549 under
different conditions assayed as indicated in the figure. Images were
obtained at 20× magnification with a white-field microscope.

Figure 5 Detection of PARP and γH2AX by Western
blot in HT-29 at 24
h.

We further investigated whether
reactive oxygen species (ROS) were
involved in the apoptosis induced by aplyzanzine B and anomoian B,
as previously established for the dibromotyrosine derivative (1′R,5′S,6′S)-2-(3′,5′-dibromo-1′,6′-dihydroxy-4′-oxacyclohex-2′-enyl)
acetonitrile (DT).15 ROS play a critical
role in cellular homeostasis, and their overproduction may induce
apoptosis or other types of cell death. ROS scavenger NAC (N-acetylcysteine) was used to pretreat the cells in order
to diminish the production of ROS. Pretreatment with 1.5 mM NAC did
not avoid PARP cleavage and γH2AX induction, indicating that
ROS are not the main mediators of the apoptotic process triggered
by these compounds in HT-29 cells.

MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells
are more resistant to both compounds
under the assay conditions used. In MDA-MB-231 cells, PARP processing
is faintly detected at 24 h, as is also the case of γH2AX induction
(Figure 6). In A549
cells, incubation for 48 h with both compounds was necessary to detect
PARP cleavage and γH2AX induction (Figure 7). ROS scavenger NAC did not affect γH2AX
induction in these cell lines.

blot in MDA-MB-231
at 24 h.

blot in A549 at 48
h.

Previous studies have shown that
the psammaplins, also bromotyrosine
derivatives, inhibit HDACs.16 HDAC inhibitors
are a promising new class of anticancer agents that act by inhibiting
cell proliferation and inducing cell cycle arrest in several cancer
cell types. To analyze whether the antiproliferative effect of aplyzanzine
B (1) and anomoian B (2) was related to
the HDAC inhibition, A549 cells were treated with both compounds at
different concentrations. As a consequence of HDAC inhibition, acetylated
histone 4 is accumulated in cells. The results, shown in Figure 8, indicated that
neither of the compounds inhibited HDACs. Compounds 1 and 2 did not induce acetyl-H4 accumulation as seen
for the positive control trichostatin A, a known HDAC inhibitor.

as a loading control.

3 Conclusions
In summary, the new bromotyrosine
derivatives anomoian B (1) and aplyzanzine B (2) were isolated from Indonesian
sponges and form part of the few examples of bromotyrosine derivatives
with a chiral center at C8. Although the oxime group of the α-carbon
in tyrosine residues is present in most bromotyrosine derivatives,
this group has been replaced in other related analogues by a primary
amine as in hexadellin A,8,20 an N-methylamine group as in anomoian A,23,27 suberedamines
A and B,24 or an N,N′-dimethylamine group as in aplyzanzine A.28

Aplyzanzine B (2) is the
first compound of the bromotyrosine
family bearing a ketone carbonyl group adjacent to the dibromobenzene
ring. Biogenetically, the ketone functionality could arise through
the oxidation of the benzylic position of the tyramine unit (see Figure 9). Compounds bearing
a OH group at that position have already been reported such as hemifistularin
3,29 aplysamine A,9 and fistularin-3.30 A further oxidation
of that benzylic OH group could be the origin of the ketone carbonyl
group present in 2.

present in aplyzanzine
B (2).

The two new compounds
described herein have shown moderate antitumor
activity against a panel of three human tumor cell lines (A549, HT-29,
and MDA-MB-231), being most active in the colon adenocarcinoma HT-29
cell line. Both compounds induce the apoptotic cell death of the tumor
cell lines assayed, although none of the mechanisms described for
this family of compounds, namely, the induction of ROS and the inhibition
of HDACs, seem to be involved in the induction of apoptosis caused
by the new compounds.

4 Materials and Methods

combined extracts were concentrated to yield a crude mass of 3.2 g.
The crude product was subjected to vacuum liquid chromatography (VLC)
on LiChroprep RP-18 with a stepped gradient from H2O to
CH3OH to CH2Cl2. The fraction that
eluted with CH3OH (565 mg) was subjected to HPLC Prep (XBridge
Prep C18 5 μm, 19 × 150 mm, gradient H2O/CH3CN from 25 to 76% CH3CN in 11 min and then 100%
in 2 min, flow rate: 15 mL/min, UV detection) to yield a crude fraction
(263 mg). This fraction was further purified by semipreparative HPLC
(SunFire C18 5 μm, 10 × 150 mm, H2O + 0.1% CF3CO2H/CH3CN + 0.1% CF3CO2H gradient from 30 to 70% in 13 min, flow rate: 3 mL/min,
UV detection) to obtain anomoian B (1, 17.6 mg, 0.037%
wet wt).

A two-sponge association of Jaspis sp. and Bubaris sp. (229 g) was triturated
and exhaustively extracted with CH3OH/CH2Cl2 (1:1, 3 × 400 mL). The combined extracts were concentrated
to yield a crude mass of 9.7 g. The crude product was subjected to
VLC on LiChroprep RP-18 with a stepped gradient from H2O to CH3OH to CH2Cl2. The fraction
that eluted with CH3OH gave a fraction of 1.88 g, which
was subjected to reversed-phase flash chromatography gradient (H2O/CH3CN from 5 to 100% in 25 min) to yield a crude
fraction (257 mg). This fraction was further purified by semipreparative
HPLC (XBridge Prep C18 5 μm, 10 × 250 mm, H2O + 0.04% CF3CO2H/CH3CN + 0.04%
CF3CO2H gradient from 20 to 84% in 16 min, flow
rate: 3 mL/min, UV detection) to obtain aplyzanzine B (2, 130 mg, 0.057% wet wt). Chiral HPLC analysis of 1 and 2 was performed in a Chiralpak AD-H column (5 × 150 mm,
H2O + 0.04% CF3CO2H/CH3CN + 0.04% CF3CO2H gradient from 20 to 84%
in 16 min, flow rate: 3 mL/min, MS detection).

4.9 Evaluation of Cytotoxic Activity
The cytotoxic activity of the isolated compounds was evaluated using
a panel of three human tumor cell lines: A549 (lung), HT-29 (colon),
and MDA-MB-231 (breast). Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5%
CO2 in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine,
and 100 units/mL penicillin–streptomycin. To determine the
cell viability, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline
(PBS), fixed for 15 min in 1% glutaraldehyde solution, rinsed twice
in PBS, and stained in 0.4% sulforhodamine B solution for 30 min at
room temperature. Cells were then rinsed several times with 1% acetic
acid solution and were air-dried. SRB was then extracted with a 10
mM Trizma base solution, and the absorbance was measured at 490 nm.
GI50 values (concentration of drug that produces a 50%
inhibition of cell growth) were calculated using Prism v5.02 software
(GraphPad, La Jolla, USA). Experiments were performed in triplicate.

4.10 Western Blotting Analysis
Cell protein
extracts were prepared following standard procedures in a radioimmunoprecipitation
assay buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors (Complete, Roche
Diagnostics) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche Diagnostics).
After quantification with the BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Scientific,
Waltham, MA, USA), 20 μg of protein was separated by sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
onto poly(vinylidene difluoride) membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore,
Billerica, MA, USA). After hybridizing with the appropriated primary
[PARP (Santa Cruz), γH2AX and acetyl-histone H4 (Upstate, Millipore),
and tubulin (Sigma)] and secondary antibodies (Santa Cruz), blots
were developed by a peroxidase reaction using the electrochemical
luminescence detection system (Amersham-G.E. Healthcare, Little Chalfont,
UK).
