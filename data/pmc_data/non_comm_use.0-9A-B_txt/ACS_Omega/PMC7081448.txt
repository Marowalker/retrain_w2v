High-refractive-index (high-n) polymers with a
high optical transparency and low birefringence (Δn) have been desired in progressive optoelectronic devices. However,
the trade-off between high-n and low-Δn remains a challenge at present. Here, the development
of a novel array of high-n, high-sulfur-containing,
highly transparent, colorless poly(phenylene sulfide) (PPS) polymers
bearing triazine units in the main chains is reported. Six new triazine
monomers T1–T6 with various pendant groups via
different linkers (−O– and −NH−) could
be prepared for developing PPSs with high-n and low
Δn values. These PPSs (P1–P6) were obtained by the polycondensation of T1–T6 with commercial aromatic dithiol, 4,4′-thiobisbenzenethiol,
respectively, which showed very high-n values (nav: 1.6902–1.7169 at 633 nm), high optical
transparency (T % > 90% @ 400 nm), and low birefringence
(Δn = 0.0015–0.0042). All the PPSs displayed
high n∞ values (1.6340–1.6654),
providing valuable information for the development of high-n triazine-based PPS materials for application not only
in the visible region but also in the near-infrared region.

Introduction
In the past few decades, high-refractive-index (high-n) polymers (HRIPs) with high optical transparency have been paid
much attention. HRIPs with a very high-n > 1.7–1.8
are sometimes used for progressive optical device applications, for
example, thermoset/thermoplastic lenses, substrates for optical devices
such as displays, optical adhesives, optical waveguides, encapsulating
materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs), organic LEDs, antireflective
coatings, microlens components for charge-coupled devices (CCDs),
and complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) image
sensors.1−7 Recently, HRIPs with high transparency in the near-infrared (NIR)
region have received particular attention in integrated optics and
lenses for NIR imaging technologies. These materials have been widely
utilized for optical tomography monitoring and night vision devices.8−10 Polymeric materials can be sorted by thermosets and thermoplastics.
Thermoset resins with high-n values derived from
episulfides,11 polythiols,12 epoxy resins,13−15 polyisocyanates,16 and their inorganic/polymer nanocomposites (NCs)17 have already been widely commercialized in the
area of eyeglasses through a cast-molding process. While thermoplastics
such as poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), polycarbonate, and cycloolefin
polymers have been used through an injection-molding process for producing
cameras, pick-up lenses, and projector lenses.18

Thermoplastic HRIPs with high transparency and low Δn are the center of attention in advanced optical applications
because of their various and flexible manufacturing processes. Based
on the Lorentz–Lorenz equation, an ordinary strategy to increase n values of polymers is to introduce substituents with high
molar refraction and to decrease the molar volume of polymer repeating
units. Thus, the introduction of aromatic rings, halogens (except
for fluorine), sulfur atoms, and metallic elements has enhanced n values of polymers. Generally, HRIPs can be categorized
into inorganic/polymer NCs and intrinsic HRIPs. To date, many NC systems
have been well developed, such as polyimide (PI)/TiO2 or
PMMA/ZrO2. Although the n-value in these
systems can be easily enhanced to 1.8 or even 2.0, their industrial
applications are still limited because of miscibility and complicated
fabrication processes.19−21 On the other hand, many high optical transparence
conventional intrinsic sulfur-containing HRIPs have been developed
for various optical applications, such as epoxy resins,22 polyurethanes,23 polymethacrylates,24 and poly(arylene sulfide)s.25 However, these polymers generally showed low n values (nav = 1.5–1.7) at the
sodium-D line (589 nm) or at 633 nm.

Previously, our group reported the synthesis and characterization
of an array of sulfur-containing aromatic PIs. These PIs reach high-n values (nav = 1.74–1.77)
and low Δn values (Δn < 0.0093), with high thermal, chemical, and oxidative stabilities
as well as mechanical toughness. However, the optical transparency
of these PIs (10 μm thick films) is lower than 80% at approximately
400 nm because of the coloration from the interaction of inter-/intrachain
charge transfer (CT) between electron-donating (diamines) and electron-accepting
(dianhydrides) moieties in the PIs, which limits the progress for
optical applications.26−33

On the other hand, high-performance engineering thermoplastics
based on poly(arylene ether)s and poly(arylene thioether)s, for example,
poly(arylene ether sulfone)s, poly(arylene ether ketone)s, and poly(phenylene
sulfide)s (PPSs), exhibited their high potential in advanced optical
applications. These polymers show not only high thermal, oxidative,
and chemical stabilities but also excellent mechanical properties.34 For example, poly(thioether ketone)s and poly(arylene
thioether)s with substituents of fluorene, sulfone, and oxadiazole
units have been prepared for various optical applications.25,35−38 These polymers exhibit excellent thermal stability and optical transparency
with low Δn. However, these polymers still
show low n values (nav = 1.66–1.72) at the sodium-D line (589 nm) because of the
sterically bulky substituents such as fluorene or sulfone groups generating
large free volumes along the polymer chains, diluting the sulfur content
and thereby resulting in relatively low n values.39 To achieve higher n values,
heteroaromatic rings possessing −C=N– units are
introduced by replacing with the phenyl rings because the −C–N=C–
units possess a higher molar refraction of 4.10 than the −C–C=C–
units (molar refraction = 1.73).40,41 Based on these
considerations, we focused on triazine dichlorides with various pendant
thioether or ether units as monomers and reported the realization
of a series of high-n and transparent triazine-based
poly(phenylene thioether)s (PPTs) also called as PPSs, which were
prepared by polycondensation from different aromatic dithiols. Indeed,
they exhibit high-n values (nav = 1.6486–1.7530 at 633 nm), high transparency in
the visible region (T > 80% @ 400 nm), and low Δn values (Δn = 0.001–0.008).42−44 In addition, the Oishi group has reported a series of poly(guanamine)s
derived from 2-substituted-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine, which showed
quite high-n values (nav = 1.677–1.800 at 589 nm) and excellent transparency in the
visible region (T > 90% @ 400 nm). These results
also prove that the triazine structure shows promising high-n values and high transparency in the visible region. Although
the dense packing induced by intermolecular hydrogen bonding (H-bonding)
between −NH groups and nitrogen atoms in the triazine unit
also enhanced the n values, the Δn values were not reported in detail.41,45 For high-performance
CMOS or CCD image sensors, lower Δn is always
essential; however, the relationship between high-n and low-Δn values remains a trade-off.

Herein, we report a new series of PPSs with different side-chain
pendent groups and linkage groups (−O– and −NH−)
prepared from 2-substituted-4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazine and 4,4′-thiobisbenzenethiol
(TBT). The combination of triazine and aromatic thiols
resulted in promising high-n values and high transparency.
Especially for PPSs with NH-linkages, the intermolecular H-bonding
further enhanced the n-values, and the energetically
stable coplanar conformation between the triazine and pendant phenyl
rings effectively reduced Δn. This is the first
example to combine the triazine-based PPSs with hydrogen bonding chemistry.
This design concept may allow us to overcome the trade-off relationship
between high-n values and low birefringence. As a
result, these PPSs exhibited excellent optical properties, for example,
high-n values (nav =
1.6902–1.7169 at 633 nm), high transmittance in the visible
region (T > 90% @ 400 nm), and low birefringence
values (Δn = 0.0015–0.0042).

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Triazine Monomers
In the synthesis of
triazine monomers, the chemoselectivity of each chloride atom on the
triazine ring for the substitution reaction of cyanuric chloride offers
the flexibility to design monomers with varied pendant groups.46 On the basis of a previous report, mono-substituted
dichloro triazine derivatives can be obtained under optimized conditions.47 In this work, to clarify the relationship between
the primary structure and properties of polymers, two types of triazine
derivatives with O- and NH-linkages were synthesized successfully
in the presence of different bases [N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and NaHCO3, respectively]
with good yields (>70%) (see Scheme 1 and Figures S1–S4).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Triazine Monomers, T1–T6
Synthesis and Characterization of Triazine-Based PPSs
The target triazine-containing PPSs were synthesized by solution
polycondensation from T1–T6 and aromatic dithiol, TBT, as shown in Scheme 2. Single-phase polycondensation was conducted to prepare
PPSs with O- and N-linkages in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), respectively, at room
temperature and 80 °C in the presence of DIPEA as an HCl scavenger.
The polycondensation proceeded readily to produce the objective polymers
with Mn values ranging from 12,000 to
67,000. Table 1 summarizes
these results. The chemical structures for the PPSs were characterized
by 1H and 13C NMR and Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy. From the representative 1H NMR spectrum
for P3 (Figure 1), signals resonating at 7.36, 7.24, 7.13, and 6.90 ppm were
assigned to aromatic rings and the signal at 2.47 ppm was assigned
to −S–CH3, respectively. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra for P1–P5 are
shown in the Supporting Information to
confirm their expected chemical structures (Figures S5–S14). The characteristic FT-IR absorption peaks for P1–P6 were observed at 1473 and 1245 cm–1, which were attributable to the −C=N– groups
in the triazine and thioether units, respectively (Figures 2 and S15–S19). In addition, broad peaks were observed for P4–P6 at approximately 3400–3000 cm–1, which
were assigned to Ph–NH–Ph and H-bonding, as expected
(Figure 2 and Supporting Information, Figures S18 and S19).45

Thermal Properties
Thermal stability, for example,
thermal decomposition temperatures (Td) and glass-transition temperatures (Tg), of high-n polymers is an important factor in
the fabrication of optical devices. The thermal requirement is usually
derived from a factor of the servicing circumstance of the optical
devices and the thermal-release problem caused by miniaturization
in integrated assemblies. In practice, the thermal stabilities of
the PPSs were studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC). These results are summarized in Table 1. All the PPSs show
an excellent thermal stability, such as a 5% weight-loss temperature
(T5%) above 330 °C under nitrogen,
probably because of the contribution of the high aromatic ring content
(Figure 3). Figure 4 shows the DSC thermograms
obtained for the PPSs. All the PPSs exhibited a high Tg of over 135 °C, and it should be mentioned that P4 and P5 derived from triazine monomers with
NH-linkages exhibited a higher Tg value
(165 and 175 °C, respectively) compared to P2 and P3 (145 and 140 °C, respectively) with O-linkages. This
might be explained by the contribution of H-bonding formation through
−NH– and the lone pair of electrons residing on the
sulfur and nitrogen atoms.

Optical Properties
Figure 5a,b shows UV–visible transmission
spectra and photographs for the PPS films, respectively. As listed
in Table 2, all the
films exhibit a short cutoff wavelength (λoffs) ranging
from 350 to 380 nm, and a high optical transmittance of approximately
90% is observed at 400 nm for a film thickness of approximately 10–50
μm. Such excellent colorlessness and transparency are probably
due to the triazine units and their metasubstituted geometry, that
is, bulky substituted pendant groups and flexible thiol linkages efficiently
suppress the localization of the π-electrons and CT interactions
in PPSs and thus prevent interchain packing. Thus, the results clearly
indicate that the combination of the triazine unit and thiol linkage
shows a promising level of high optical transparency in the visible
region. This view is also suggested by the calculated optical absorption
spectra for the model PPS compounds (Figure S20). As shown in Figure S21, no absorption
peaks are detected in the near-UV and visible regions, and the slightly
longer absorption edge observed for P5 in Figure 5a is reproduced in the calculation.

On the other hand, the in-plane (nTE) and out-of-plane (nTM) refractive indices
for the PPS films at 633 nm were determined to lie in the range of
1.6916–1.7174 and 1.6874–1.7159, respectively. The result
that nTE show slightly higher values than nTM for all the PPS films reflects the favored
orientation of the polymer chains parallel to the subtracts. The average
refractive indices (navs) ranged between
1.6902 and 1.7169 at 633 nm. Indeed, P5 with the highest
sulfur content (27.60 wt %) showed the highest nav value of 1.7169, as expected. It should be mentioned that
the formation of H-bonding in P4–P6 can be proven
by the broad absorption peaks observed in the IR spectra (3000–3400
cm–1) (Figures 2, S18, and S19).45 In addition, from the results obtained from
DSC, P4 and P5 with NH-linkages exhibited
higher Tg values compared to P2 and P3 with O-linkages, probably because of the contribution
of intermolecular H-bonding (Figure 4). Such an H-bonding effect also leads to the higher n values obtained for P4 and P5 (1.7112 and 1.7169, respectively) compared to that for P2 and P3 (1.6902
and 1.7082, respectively).41 Furthermore,
the intramolecular conformational effect as well as the H-bonding
effect in the PPS chains might result in the lower Δn for P4 and P5 (0.0018 and 0.0015,
respectively) compared with that for P2 and P3 (0.0042 and 0.0031, respectively). As shown in Figure S22d,e, the energetically stable conformations between
the triazine and pendant phenyl ring for the PPSs with NH-linkages
predicted by density functional theory (DFT) are coplanar structures,
which effectively reduce Δn by compensating
the anisotropies in the polarizability of the main chain with that
for the side chain, which results in the lower Δn of P4 and P5. Additionally, the meta-linkages
and flexible thioether units in the PPS might also lead to small Δn values in the range of 0.0015–0.0042.

Figure 6a,b shows
the observed and calculated nav values
as a function of wavelength, respectively. In these figures, the solid
lines are fitted with the simplified Cauchy formula [nλ = n∞ + Dλ–2], where nλ is the refractive index at wavelength λ, n∞ is the calculated refractive index
at infinite wavelength, and D is the coefficient
of dispersion. As can been seen from the data, the order of the observed nav values for P1–P6 is mostly
consistent with the calculated values. The n∞ and D values for the PPS films determined
from the experimental nav values are found
to range from 1.6340 to 1.6654 and 0.0164 to 0.0230, respectively.
The high n∞ values (inherent refractive
indices that exclude the effect of optical absorption in the UV region)
for the PPSs essentially derive from the high sulfur content. In addition,
the small D values (wavelength dispersion of the
refractive indices) also originate from the UV absorption observed
in the relatively shorter UV region (<360 nm).8,48 As
shown in Figure S23, the same trends are
observed in the calculated nav values
at shorter wavelengths in the visible region, and significantly high nav values of 1.73–1.78 are expected at
a wavelength of approximately 430 nm. All the results confirm that
the introduction of the triazine ring together with aromatic dithiols
imparts PPSs with high n values, low Δn values, and high transparency in the visible to the NIR
regions. Moreover, all PPS films are self-standing and bendable, showing
high potential in the high-performance optical coatings.

refractive indices of models for P1–P6.

Solubility Tests
The solubility of P1–P6 is given in Table 3. The meta-substituted structures for the triazine units as well
as the flexible thioether linkages might induce solubility of the
obtained PPSs in several organic solvents. P1–P3 with O-linkages showed a higher solubility in nonpolar solvents
compared to P4–P6 with NH-linkages. On the other
hand, P4–P6 exhibited a better solubility in polar
aprotic solvents, for example, DMAc and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).
Such a high solubility for the PPS series of polymers is practically
important for fabrication processes.

Conclusions
Six types of new PPSs (P1–P6) were successfully
synthesized by single-phase polycondensation between triazine monomers
(T1–T6) and dithiol monomers. P1–P6 possessing high sulfur content (22.93–27.60 wt %) displayed
high-n values (1.6902–1.7169 @ 633 nm), high
transparency (T % > 90% @ 400 nm), and low-Δn (Δn = 0.0015–0.0042). P1–P6 also exhibited good thermal stability (Td5% > 330 °C and Tg: 135–190 °C), which can facilitate device manufacturing
processes. All the PPSs exhibited high n∞ values (1.6340–1.6654), providing valuable information for
the development of high-n PPS materials for application
not only in the visible region but also in the NIR region. Especially
for P4 and P5, a very low Δn (0.0018 and 0.0015, respectively) was accomplished, probably
because of the intermolecular H-bonding formation and the highly isotropic
structures originating from the energetically stable coplanar conformations
between the triazine and pendant phenyl rings, as evidenced by DFT
calculation. In summary, the newly developed PPSs are promising candidates
as advanced materials for optical applications in the near future.

Film Preparation
The polymer P1–P3 and P4–P6 films were prepared by solution-casting
in 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane (TCE) and N,N′-dimethylpropyleneurea (DMPU), respectively, followed
by heating on a hot plate from 25 to 150 °C and standing at 150
°C overnight under a nitrogen atmosphere. The films with the
thicknesses of 10–50 μm were obtained.

Measurements
The 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were documented on a JEOL JNM-ECX400 spectrometer at resonant
frequencies of 400 MHz for 1H and 100 MHz for 13C nuclei using CDCl3-d1, THF-d8, and DMSO-d6 as
solvents and tetramethylsilane as the reference. FT-IR spectra were
recorded on a Nicolet iS5 Fourier transform spectrophotometer. Mn and Mw values
were measured by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) on a JASCO GULLIVER
1500 system equipped with two polystyrene gel columns (Plegel 5 μm
MIXED-C) that were eluted with THF at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and
calibrated by polystyrene standard samples. TG measurements were performed
on a Seiko EXSTAR 6000 TG/DTA 6300 thermal analysis system at a heating
rate of 10 °C/min. DSC analysis was conducted on a DSC 6200 at
a heating rate of 10 °C/min under nitrogen. The in-plane (nTE) and out-of-plane (nTM) refractive indices of PPS films were measured using a prism
coupler (Metricon, model PC-2010) equipped with laser diodes (wavelength:
636, 845, 1324, and 1558 nm) and a half-waveplate in the light path.
The in-plane/out-of-plane birefringence values (Δn) were estimated as the difference between nTE and nTM, and the average refractive
indices were calculated according to the following equation: nav = [(2nTE2 + nTM2)/3]1/2.

Calculation
Optimized geometries, molecular polarizabilities,
and spectroscopic properties of model compounds for the six types
of PPSs (Scheme S1) were calculated using
the Gaussian 16, Revision C.01 program package,50 which was installed at the Global Scientific Information
and Computing Center (GSIC), Tokyo Institute of Technology. Model
structures were optimized by DFT at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of
theory, followed by calculations of wavelength-dependent molecular
polarizabilities and one-electron transitions using the time-dependent
DFT method with B3LYP functionals. The 6-311++G(2d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p)
basis set functions were used for calculations of polarizabilities
and one-electron transitions, respectively. The methods and procedures
to calculate the wavelength-dependent refractive indices and optical
absorption spectra have been reported elsewhere.51−54
