Development of highly
efficient catalysts to expedite the degradation
of organic dyes has been drawing great attention. The aggregation
of catalysts reduces the accessibility of catalytic centers for organic
dyes and therefore decreases their catalytic ability. Herein, we report
a facile method to prepare highly biocompatible and stable dendrimer-encapsulated
palladium nanoparticles (Pdn-G5MCI NPs),
which exhibit high catalytic efficiency for oxidation of morin. The
biocompatible dendrimers were prepared via surface modification of
G5 polyamidoamine (G5 PAMAM) dendrimers using maleic anhydride and l-cysteine. Then, they were incubated with disodium tetrachloropalladate,
followed by reduction using sodium borohydride to generate Pdn-G5MCI NPs. Transmission electron microscopy
results demonstrated that palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs) inside
Pdn-G5MCI had small diameters (1.77–2.35
nm) and monodisperse states. Dynamic light scattering results confirmed
that Pdn-G5MCI NPs had good dispersion
and high stability in water. Furthermore, MTT results demonstrated
that Pdn-G5MCI NPs had high biocompatibility.
More importantly, Pdn-G5MCI NPs successfully
catalyzed the decomposition of H2O2 to the hydroxyl
radical (•OH), and the generated •OH quickly oxidized morin. This reaction kinetics followed pseudo-first-order
kinetics. Apparent rate constant (kapp) is an important criterion for evaluating the catalytic rate. The
concentrations of Pdn-G5MCI NPs and H2O2 were positively correlated with kapp, whereas the correlation between the concentration
of morin and kapp was negative. The prepared
Pdn-G5MCI NPs have great potential to
catalyze the degradation of organic dyes in bio-related systems in
the future.

1 Introduction
In
recent years, the pollution by organic dyes has been drawing
great attention due to the potential toxicity toward humans and other
creatures. Morin is a kind of flavonoid dye, which is commonly found
in fruits, vegetables, and the chemical industry. Many methods have
been developed to treat the organic dyes such as catalytic oxidation,1 adsorption,2−4 photodegradation,5 and electrochemical methods.6 Catalytic oxidation is one of the most promising methods for removal
of organic dyes. Noble-metal nanoparticles such as palladium nanoparticles
(Pd NPs) are widely employed in the degradation of pollutants because
of their high catalytic activity.7−9 The smaller sizes of
Pd NPs within the size range of 1–10 nm lead to larger specific
surface areas and higher catalytic activities. However, Pd NPs are
easily aggregated in a thermodynamically unstable state due to their
high specific surface energy.

To address this problem, immobilization
of Pd NPs by suitable materials
such as proteins,10 polymers,11 and dendrimers12 has
been used to prepare highly stable and well-dispersed Pd NPs, which
was mainly due to the electrostatic and steric effects. Dendrimers
have the unique structure and many functional groups both inside and
outside the molecule. Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers were one
kind of widely studied dendrimers. Encapsulation of Cu nanoclusters
within PAMAM dendrimers were first developed by Crooks and coworkers.13 Subsequently, many other metal nanoparticles
(Au, Pd, Pt) were stabilized/encapsulated by PAMAM dendrimers.12,14 However, the highly positive charges of PAMAM dendrimers, resulting
from the large number of primary amine on their surface, induce the
nonspecific interaction with proteins, cells, and bacteria, leading
to reduced catalytic ability of noble-metal nanoparticles inside the
dendrimers in bio-related medium. Thus, many materials were explored
to modify the surface of PAMAM dendrimers to reduce these interactions,
including polyethylene glycol, phosphorylcholine,15 and carboxyl betaine.16

In this study, maleic anhydride- and l-cysteine-modified
G5 PAMAM dendrimers (G5MCI) have been synthesized. G5MCI was used
as the new template to prepare highly biocompatible and stable dendrimer-encapsulated
Pd NPs (Pdn-G5MCI NPs). The diameter of
Pd NPs inside G5MCI was about 2 nm. Pd55-G5MCI-treated
HeLa cells showed no noticeable cytotoxicity in vitro. The catalytic
oxidation of morin using Pdn-G5MCI was
used to evaluate their catalytic ability. These results indicated
that they had great potential applications as bio-related catalysts.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis and Characterization
In
this work, biocompatible and stable Pdn-G5MCI NPs were prepared through the method shown in Scheme 1. Monodispersed metal nanoparticles
can be encapsulated in G5 PAMAM dendrimers.17,18 However, the high density of primary amino groups on the surface
of the G5 PAMAM dendrimers leads to highly positive charges, resulting
in their strong interactions with proteins, bacteria, and cells. Herein,
maleic anhydride and l-cysteine were used to modify the surface
of dendrimers to obtain a biocompatible template. The modified process
was confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. G5 PAMAM (Figure S1a) had about 128 primary amino groups,
which were located on the surface of G5 PAMAM.19 After the reaction of G5 PAMAM with maleic anhydride, two
new peaks at 5.8 and 6.2 ppm appeared (Figure S1b). All primary amines were successfully reacted with maleic
anhydride. After the addition of l-cysteine, these peaks
completely disappeared and a new peak at 3.2 ppm appeared, indicating
the successful preparation of G5MCI.20 G5MCI
and PdCl42– were incubated for 20 min
at pH 4, then excess of NaBH4 was added to this solution
to obtain Pd55-G5MCI and Pd110-G5MCI. There
was slight difference between G5MCI and Pd55-G5MCI (Figure S1d) that occurred in the 1H NMR spectra, indicating that palladium atoms had a weak effect
on the spectrum of G5MCI.

Palladium Nanoparticles
In addition, the absorbance of the solution was recorded to monitor
the formation of Pd55-G5MCI. As illustrated in Figure 1, there was one absorption
peak at 416 nm. After the addition of NaBH4, a broad absorption
band appeared. In addition, the solution color changed from yellow
to dark brown. These results were consistent with the previous reports.18 PdCl42– was reduced
to generate Pd NPs stabilized by G5MCI.

of solutions: G5MCI, Na2PdCl4, Pd55-G5MCI, Pd110-G5MCI, and G5MCI
+ Na2PdCl4 and (b) corresponding photos.

The diameters of Pd NPs inside of dendrimers were
characterized
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Figure 2 shows that the average sizes of Pd NPs inside
Pd55-G5MCI and Pd110-G5MCI were 1.77 ±
0.37 and 2.35 ± 0.38 nm, respectively. The results indicated
that Pd NPs inside G5MCI had a small size and a narrow size distribution.
The molar ratio of Na2PdCl4 to G5MCI was used
to regulate the size of Pd NPs.18 The specific
surface of Pd55-G5MCI and Pd110-G5MCI were 3.39
and 2.55 nm–1, respectively. The larger specific
surface areas resulted in more active centers. These characteristics
are beneficial for highly catalytic efficiency degradation of organic
dyes.

2.2 Stability
Various organic dyes can
be commonly found in sewage. High stability of a catalyst in sewage
is beneficial for long-term high catalytic ability. Many noble nanoparticles
show low stability in sewage with different pH. Here, the effect of
pH ranging from 4 to 9 on the stability of Pd55-G5MCI in
different solutions was evaluated by the hydrodynamic size change.
The hydrodynamic size was monitored by dynamic light scattering. As
shown in Figure 3a,
Pd55-G5MCI had similar hydrodynamic size about 10 nm at
different pH, indicating that Pd55-G5MCI was well dispersed
in water. Pd55-G5MCI maintained their hydrodynamic size
without obvious agglomeration within 2 days. Thus, Pd55-G5MCI remained stable within pH 4–9. Figure 3b shows that the zeta potential of Pd55-G5MCI NPs decreased with the increasing pH. The zeta potential
of Pd55-G5MCI changed from −0.95 mV at pH 4 to −7.48
mV at pH 9. This should be due to protonation/deprotonation of primary
amine groups and carboxyl groups under different pH conditions. The
electrostatic stabilization and steric stabilization affect the stability
of nanoparticles.21 The higher net charge
preventing agglomeration often leads to higher stability of NPs due
to electrostatic force repulsion. However, the net charge of Pd55-G5MCI was relatively small. The electrostatic stabilization
was not the main reason; however, the steric stabilization should
be the main reason. Steric stabilization usually occurs between soluble
large macromolecules. In short, we obtained the Pd NPs with small
particle size and high stability; these properties are ideal for the
catalytic oxidation of morin.

of Pd55-G5MCI NPs under different pH.

2.3 Biocompatibility
The high biocompatibility
of catalysts is good for their usage under bio-related conditions.
The cytotoxicity of synthetic Pd55-G5MCI NPs against HeLa
cells was evaluated by an MTT assay.22−24 As depicted in Figure 4a, the cell viability
decreased significantly with increasing concentration of Pd55-G5 NPs. The lowest cell viability treated with Pd55-G5
was 13.7% at the concentration of 200 μg/mL. In contrast, the
cell viability treated with Pd55-G5MCI (200 μg/mL)
was 96.3%. The cytotoxicity of Pd55-G5 NPs and Pd55-G5MCI NPs was also evaluated by visualizing the morphologies of
HeLa cells. Figure 4c shows obvious shrink morphology for HeLa cells incubated with Pd55-G5 at the concentration of 200 μg/mL, whereas Figure 4d shows that HeLa
cells toward Pd55-G5MCI and control groups had similar
cell morphology. The results confirmed that Pd55-G5MCI
NPs had no cytotoxicity against HeLa cells within 200 μg/mL.
The cytotoxicity of Pd55-G5 should be due to the formation
of holes on cell membranes.25 The enhanced
biocompatibility of Pd55-G5MCI was caused by the surface
modification using maleic anhydride and l-cysteine,19 which restricted the entrance of Pd55-G5MCI into the interior of HeLa cells.26 Hildebrand and coworkers reported the cytotoxicity of palladium/magnetite
nanocatalysts, which have been used in catalysis of waste water.27 The good accessibility between substrates and
catalytic sites on catalysts is beneficial for their high catalytic
activity. Rotello and coworkers reported that the presence of bacteria
inhibited the catalytic oxidation of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic
acid) by Dop-Fe3O4 nanoparticles.28 The high biocompatibility may be beneficial
to good accessibility between substrates and catalytic sites in bio-related
degradation.

(a) H2O2, (b) Pd55-G5MCI + H2O2 (Cmorin = 0.07 mM; CH2O2 = 5 mM; CPd55-G5MCI = 0.15 μM).

2.4 Catalytic Kinetics
The molecular
formula of morin is C15H10O7·2H2O; the structure of morin has an oxygen-containing heterocyclic
ring which connects two aromatic rings. Figure 5a shows that the maximal absorption wavelength
of morin in this buffer was 403 nm. When morin and H2O2 were incubated together, the absorbance at 403 nm only decreased
to 98% after 40 min. In addition, the incubation of morin and Pd55-G5MCI had similar results. In contrast, Figure 5b shows that the absorbance
at 403 nm quickly decreased with increasing time when morin, H2O2, and Pd55-G5MCI were mixed together,
which was due to the decreased concentration of morin, indicating
that catalytic oxidation of morin was obviously accelerated. Meanwhile,
a new peak at 318 nm increased, which was due to the formation of
intermediate product named benzafuranone. However, the peak at λ
318 nm decreased after about 10 min, indicating that benzafuranone
was further oxidized into other products.29 For the kinetic study, we mainly investigated the initial product
in this reaction by controlling the time less than 10 min.

between ln(Ct/C0) at λ = 403 nm and the reaction time
(t) for (a) Pd55-G5MCI NPs, (b) Pd110-G5MCI NPs, and (c) control groups (CPd = 8.05 × 10–6 M) (d) Relationship
between kapp and the concentration of
Pd (Cmorin = 0.07 mM, CH2O2 = 5 mM).

Furthermore, the catalytic kinetics of the oxidation of morin for
Pd55-G5MCI and Pd110-G5MCI was investigated. Figure 6a,b shows that the
ln(Ct/C0)
was linear with time, indicating that this reaction followed pseudo-first-order
kinetics. As shown in Figure 6c, morin and [morin + Pd55-G5MCI] had similar relationship
between ln(Ct/C0) at λ = 403 nm and reaction time (t). In
contrast, the addition of Pd55-G5MCI NPs (CPd = 8.05 × 10–6 M) led to an accelerated
catalytic rate. Thus, Pd55-G5MCI NPs instead of morin adsorption
were the main factor for the catalytic degradation of morin. The apparent
rate constant, kapp was calculated from
the following eq 1. Figure 6d shows that the kapp increased with increasing catalyst concentration.
This was due to the increasing surface area. Moreover, the kapp of Pd55-G5MCI is larger than
that of Pd110-G5MCI at the same Pd concentration because
Pd NPs inside Pd55-G5MCI have smaller size and larger specific
surface area, leading to more available catalytic active sites and
faster catalytic rate. 1  

Furthermore, the relationship between the different concentrations
of morin, H2O2, and kapp were also studied. This kinetic study was measured by determining kapp, while varying the morin concentration and
fixing the H2O2 concentration at room temperature.
As shown in Figure 7a, it is obvious that kapp decreased
as the morin concentration increased. This result can be attributed
to adsorption constants Kmorin > KH2O2.30 The morin and H2O2 were first adsorbed
onto the surface of the catalyst before reaction. As the concentration
of morin increased, most of the surface area of Pd NPs inside of Pd55-G5MCI would be covered by morin. This also made it more
difficult for H2O2 to be adsorbed onto the active
site of the catalyst, and therefore, decreased the reaction rate. Figure 7b shows that kapp increased as the H2O2 concentration increased. These results were consistent with the
previous results that MnOx nanoparticles
catalyzed the oxidation of morin.31

of the concentration of (a) morin and (b) H2O2 on the kapp of Pd55-G5MCI
and Pd110-G5MCI (CPd55-G5MCI = CPd110-G5MCI = 0.16 μM).

The presence of H2O2 was necessary for the
oxidation of morin. Terephthalic acid (TA) was used to detect the
amount of •OH. TA reacts with •OH to form a strong fluorescence product, and the relative concentration
of •OH was determined indirectly by measuring the
intensity of the fluorescence after the reaction.32 Liu and coworkers
prepared CeO2-montmorillonites nanocomposites. They found
that the generated •OH were from the decomposition
of H2O2.33 Liu and
coworkers reported that Ag2S-montmorillonites catalyzed
the decomposition of H2O2 into •OH.134 The presence of free radicals is
correlated to the surrounding conditions.34 As shown in Figure 8a, the group [TA + H2O2 + Pd55-G5MCI]
had the maximal absorption at 430 nm. Figure 8b shows that the fluorescence intensities
of TA, TA + Pd55-G5MCI, TA + H2O2, and TA + H2O2+Pd55-G5MCI were
19.7, 10.5, 406.6, and 1223.0, respectively. Thus, Pd55-G5MCI promoted the production of •OH.

spectra of TA, TA + Pd55-G5MCI, TA
+ H2O2, and TA + H2O2 +
Pd55-G5MCI (CTA = 0.3 mM, CH2O2 = 20 mM, CPd55-G5MCI = 1.45 μM)
and (b) fluorescence intensities of these samples at 430 nm.

The catalytic oxidation of morin by Pdn-G5MCI should follow the Langmuir–Hinshelwood
model as shown
in Figure 9.35−37 Both morin and H2O2 were adsorbed onto the
surface of Pd NPs. The adsorption of morin and H2O2 were fast and reversible. H2O2 was
catalyzed to generate •OH by Pdn-G5MCI.38Concomitantly, •OH reacted with morin adsorbed on the active sites of Pd NPs of Pdn-G5MCI. This step was rate-determining in
the whole catalytic cycle. The final product dissociated from Pd NPs
surface and the newly formed free active sites were used for new catalytic
reaction.39 The reaction kinetics was controlled
by surface reaction kinetics, not diffusion.40

3 Conclusions
In summary, a new method using
G5MCI as the template to encapsulate
Pd NPs was demonstrated. The prepared Pdn-G5MC had high pH sensitivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Pdn-G5MCI efficiently catalyzed oxidation of
morin in the presence of H2O2, and this reaction
followed pseudo-first-order kinetics. The Pdn-G5MCI accelerated the decomposition of H2O2 into •OH. The concentration of the catalyst
and H2O2 had a positive correlation with kapp, whereas the correlation between morin and kapp was negative. The prepared Pdn-G5MC has great potential to be used in the treatment
of waste water in the future.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Preparation of Pdn-G5MCI NPs
G5 PAMAM (8 mg) and maleic anhydride (5.5 mg)
were mixed in dimethyl sulfoxide for 24 h and dialyzed against water
using a dialysis bag. l-cysteine (128 mg) was added to the
obtained solution and reacted for 24 h. The dialysis was carried out
to obtain the final product named as G5MCI. Yield: 95%.

G5MCI
(13.7 nmol) was dissolved in 1200 μL of deionized water, and
the pH of the solution was tuned to 4 by adding 1 M HCl. Then, 381
μL Na2PdCl4 (2 mM) aqueous solution was
added for another incubation for 20 min at 20 °C. Five-fold molar
excess of NaBH4 dissolved in 0.3 M NaOH was added to yield
Pd55-G5MCI NPs. Then, 1 M HCl was added to tune pH of the
solution to 7. The solution was dialyzed against water. Pd110-G5MCI NPs were also obtained using this procedure.

4.2 Catalytic Properties
Morin was dissolved
in pH 9.2 carbonate buffer. Morin (2 mM, 70 μL), carbonate buffer,
50 μL Pd55-G5MCI solution, and 25 μL H2O2 (0.4 M) were added in a cuvette. The final concentration
of morin, H2O2, and Pd55-G5MCI was
0.07, 5 mM, and 0.15 μM, respectively. UV–vis spectra
were recorded every 2.5 min. The effects of the concentration of Pdn-G5MCI (CPd =
8.05–48.3 μM, Cmorin = 0.07
mM, CH2O2 = 5 mM)
on the kinetics were recorded at λ = 403 nm in a time-dependent
mode at room temperature. The catalytic performances at different
concentrations of morin (Cmorin = 0.0375–0.285
mM, CPdn-G5MCI = 0.16 μM, CH2O2 = 0.01 M) and H2O2 (CH2O2 = 0.01–0.06 M, CPdn-G5MCI = 0.16 μM, Cmorin = 0.055 mM) were also measured at room
temperature with the similar procedure. The relationship between concentration
of the catalyst, morin, H2O2, and kapp was also calculated.
