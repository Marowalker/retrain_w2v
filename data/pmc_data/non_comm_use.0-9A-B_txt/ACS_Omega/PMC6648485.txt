Ketoprofen is a widely used nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) that also exhibits cytotoxic activity against various cancers.
This makes ketoprofen an attractive structural lead for the development
of new NSAIDs and cytotoxic agents. Recently, the incorporation of
carboranes as phenyl mimetics in structures of established drugs has
emerged as an attractive strategy in drug design. Herein, we report
the synthesis and evaluation of four novel carborane-containing derivatives
of ketoprofen, two of which are prodrug esters with an nitric oxide-releasing
moiety. One of these prodrug esters exhibited high cytostatic activity
against melanoma and colon cancer cell lines. The most pronounced
activity was found in cell lines that are sensitive to oxidative stress,
which was apparently induced by the ketoprofen analogue.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ketoprofen
(Figure 1) is a nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) belonging to the
group of substituted propionic acids. It is used to treat rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis, dysmenorrhea, and to alleviate moderate
pain. Ketoprofen has pharmacologic activity similar to that of other
NSAIDs, and this is associated with the inhibition of prostaglandin
synthesis catalyzed by both cyclooxygenase (COX) isoforms, COX-1 and
COX-2. Its anti-inflammatory effects result from the inhibition of
both COX-1 and COX-2, the latter being responsible for the production
of prostaglandins under inflammatory conditions.1−3 In addition
to its effects on COX, ketoprofen inhibits the lipoxygenase pathway
of the arachidonic acid cascade. It is known that lipoxygenase inhibitors
have also the potential to attenuate inflammation, and this inhibition
is complementary to the COX inhibitory action.4,5 Furthermore,
it is a powerful inhibitor of bradykinin, an important peptidic mediator
of pain and inflammation.2

oxide (NO)-releasing analogue of ketoprofen

Generally, the side effects of ketoprofen are similar to
those
of other classical NSAIDs.7 Serious side
effects result mostly from gastrointestinal (GI) damage. In fact,
ketoprofen is known to be one of the most ulcerogenic NSAIDs with
a risk factor for serious GI complications close to that of ibuprofen.8 These side effects are mainly caused by the fact
that ketoprofen is a nonselective COX inhibitor. In contrast to COX-2,
COX-1 is constitutively expressed within the body and is responsible
for the production of prostaglandins that have important physiological
functions, and thus inhibition of this isoform can result in side
effects.9

The search for therapeutics
with fewer side effects has led to
the development of nitric oxide (NO)-releasing prodrugs of established
drugs.10,11 Given the gastrotoxicity of ketoprofen,
the design of an NO-releasing prodrug is beneficial as NO exhibits
cytoprotective properties in the digestive mucosa.12 There are known examples of NO-releasing analogues of ketoprofen
that have an aliphatic-linked NO-releasing moiety, i.e., a nitrate.
The antinociceptive effect and efficacy of these compounds were tested
on rats, and one of the compounds, HCT-2037 (Figure 1), was found to be a potent and effective
analgesic agent.6

The versatile biological
role of NSAIDs is further fortified by
the findings that besides their anti-inflammatory action they exhibit
cytotoxic properties.13−15 Ketoprofen was found to exhibit cytostatic activity
against various cancer types, including cervical cancer,16 osteosarcoma,17 and
colon cancer,16,18 based on diverse effects ranging
from inhibition of metastasis17 to affecting
angiogenesis.19

Due to their importance
for the treatment of inflammation and their
cytotoxic potential, new NSAIDs are constantly developed, mostly by
derivatizing established COX inhibitors. An attractive drug design
strategy is the incorporation of dicarba-closo-dodecaboranes,
or carboranes,20,21 in place of hydrophobic moieties.22,23 Carboranes are icosahedral clusters composed of 2 CH and 10 BH vertices.
Based on the arrangement of the carbon atoms within the boron cluster,
ortho, meta, and para isomers exist. Due to their size, shape, and
hydrophobicity, they are considered as phenyl mimetics,23 and several examples of carboranyl analogues
of NSAIDs have been studied already.24−28 In the case of indomethacin, substitution of one
phenyl ring with a carborane cluster resulted in a shift from nonselective
to COX-2-selective inhibitory activity.24 Furthermore, due to their high boron content, boron clusters are
used in boron neutron capture therapy.20,21,29,30 Incorporation of a
carborane moiety in the scaffolds of bioactive molecules is expected
to increase their metabolic stability given that carborane clusters
are highly resilient toward metabolic transformations.23,31

Herein, we report the synthesis of carborane-containing derivatives
of ketoprofen. The carborane moiety was intended to induce selectivity
toward COX-2 and increase the metabolic stability of the resulting
ketoprofen analogue. Furthermore, we introduced NO-releasing moieties
to obtain derivatives that incorporate the beneficial cytoprotective
activity of NO.32 The synthesized compounds
were tested to determine their potential as COX inhibitors as well
as for their potential cytotoxic activity.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Molecular Design and Synthesis
of Ketoprofen
Analogues
Ketoprofen’s molecular structure features
two phenyl rings, which, in principle, allow for introduction of the
carborane moiety. In this work, the nonsubstituted ring was chosen
to be replaced with a carborane cluster (Scheme 1, compounds 3 and 4) as metabolic transformations of ketoprofen occur at this phenyl
ring.33 This is also a good surrogate for
comparing the effect of a carborane substitution of a keto-bound benzene
ring to the biological activity of the native drug.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Ketoprofen
Analogues 3 (from ortho-Carborane) and 4 (from meta-Carborane)
(i) SOCl2, reflux;
(ii) n-BuLi, anhydrous Et2O, and toluene
(1:1) at −40 °C; (iii) with either 1 (for 3) or 2 (for 4) as starting material;
mixture of acetic acid and 6 M HCl (2:1), refluxed overnight.

As the most viable option for the synthesis of the
carboranyl derivative
of ketoprofen, the synthetic methodology involving a reaction between
a lithio carborane and an acyl halide was chosen. This synthetic approach
was performed with both an ortho-carborane and a meta-carborane to examine the effect of the position of
the cluster carbon atoms on the chemical and biological properties
of the compound. The meta isomer may be preferred as it is more stable
toward deboronation compared to its ortho counterpart.23 On the other hand, the ortho cluster can be
easily transformed into a nido-carborane,34 which may also be beneficial for the properties
of the ketoprofen analogue.

The reaction conditions were chosen
based on those previously reported
by Zakharkin et al. for the synthesis of a methyl ketone derivative
of ortho-carborane.35 To
obtain a high yield of the monosubstituted derivative, a mixture of
toluene and diethyl ether was used as the solvent for the lithiation
step, and an equimolar amount of n-BuLi was reacted
with ortho- or meta-carborane. The
lithiated carborane was then added to freshly prepared 3-(1-cyanoethyl)benzoyl
chloride dissolved in diethyl ether (Scheme 1). The addition step should be performed
by adding the nucleophile to the electrophile to minimize the possibility
of reduction of the newly formed keto group to a tertiary alcohol.
By this approach, compounds 1 and 2 were
obtained. Besides the characterization of the intermediates, the molecular
structure of the ortho derivative 1 could be verified
by X-ray crystallography (Supporting Information (SI), Table S1, Figure S1).

The synthesis of the propionitrile derivatives 1 and 2 created intermediates that could be further transformed
into the desired propionic acid derivatives 3 and 4 (Scheme 1). This is easily achievable by hydrolysis of the cyano group to
a carboxylic group under acidic or basic conditions. To minimize the
possibility of a deboronation side reaction of ortho-carborane, which is even more likely to occur due to the electron-withdrawing
carbonyl group attached at the carborane cluster,36 the nitrile hydrolysis was done under acidic conditions.
The hydrolysis was performed under reflux employing a mixture of acetic
acid as the solvent and concentrated hydrochloric acid. This afforded
the ketoprofen analogues 3 and 4 in quantitative
yields. 3 and 4 were fully characterized
and their structures were confirmed by X-ray crystallography (Figure 2; SI, Tables S2, S3 and Figures S2, S3).

derivative 4 (right). (Oak Ridge thermal ellipsoid plot:
displacement thermal ellipsoids are drawn at 50% probability level.
Hydrogen atoms are omitted for clarity.) Detailed crystallographic
parameters can be found in the SI (Tables S2 and S3).

To expand the functionality
of the synthesized carboranyl derivatives
of ketoprofen, a nitrate group was introduced to generate a prodrug
with an NO-releasing moiety. Within the carborane-based ketoprofen
analogues, the carboxylic group is the most accessible functionality
to insert a linker with one or more nitrate groups attached. For this
work, an aliphatic derivative of dinitroglycerol was chosen because
aromatic linkers are known to be associated with increased carcinogenicity.37 Furthermore, this allows the release of two
NO molecules per inhibitor molecule. Activation of the carboxylic
group as acyl halide and reaction with 1,3-dinitroglycerol or the
corresponding alcoholate did not yield the desired product, even after
prolonged reaction times and at elevated temperature. This may be
attributed to the poor nucleophilicity of 1,3-dinitroglycerol. Finally,
the dinitrate esters 5 and 6 could successfully
be generated by employing Steglich esterification conditions with
dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) and 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP)
as coupling reagents (Scheme 2). Due to the presence of a chiral center in the nitrate esters 5 and 6, the methylene protons of the isopropyl
group are diastereotopic and can be observed as pairs of doublets
via coupling to the methine proton in the 1H NMR spectra.

2.2 Evaluation of COX Inhibitory and Cytotoxic
Activities
All compounds were tested for their COX inhibitory
activity employing a commercial enzymatic COX assay (“COX Fluorescent
Inhibitor Screening Assay Kit”, Item no. 700100, Cayman Chemical,
Ann Arbor, MI) as described elsewhere.38 However, only compound 5, the ketoprofen analogue bearing
an ortho-carborane and a nitrate moiety, exhibited
weak COX inhibition without selectivity for one of the isoforms (SI, Table S4). The other compounds did not exhibit
any COX inhibitory activity.

To investigate the antitumor activity
of the carboranyl analogues of ketoprofen, three melanoma as well
as three colon cancer cell lines were used. The selection of the cell
lines was based on their ability to express COX-2; A375,39 B16F10,40 B16,41 CT26CL2542 are expressing
COX-2, whereas HCT116 and SW480 do not.43 The four synthesized compounds were applied at 0.8–50 μM,
and the percentage of viable cells was determined by measuring mitochondrial
respiration [MTT assay employing 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] as well as DNA/RNA content of attached cells (crystal violet
(CV) assay employing crystal violet). After 48 h incubation, the colorimetric
assays revealed that only compound 6 affected cell viability
of the tested cells in a dose-dependent manner with an inhibitory
activity varying among the cell lines (Table 1).

Interestingly,
the highest sensitivity was found for the COX-2-expressing
melanoma cell line A375 and the COX-2-negative colon cancer cell line
HCT116, indicating that the cytotoxic activity of 6 is
probably COX-2 independent. This is consistent with the observation
that 6 does not exhibit COX inhibitory activity. Comparing
the sensitivities among the different cell lines showed that the redox-sensitive
cell lines44 are most susceptible to 6. The IC50 values determined with both assays
(MTT, CV) were similar and showed that 6 affects the
cell viability in a micromolar range; in contrast, ketoprofen did
not affect cell viability in the same dose range (Figure 3). This result is in agreement
with the previously reported low effectiveness of ketoprofen against
different cell lines.45−47 However, a significant cytostatic effect was observed
upon exposure of human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) and human colon cancer
cells (Caco-2) to ketoprofen, which may be attributed to the NF-κB
inhibition that was detected.16

Figure 3 Effect of ketoprofen
and 6 on the cell viability of
different cell lines. Cells were exposed to 6 (A) or
ketoprofen (B) for 48 h, and cell viability was analyzed using MTT
(left panel) and CV assays (right panel). *p <
0.05 compared to untreated controls.

Comparison of sensitivities toward 6 of malignant
cells (Table 1) versus
primary macrophages (IC50 = 46.55 ± 3.36 μM)
showed that the compound is relatively selective for cancer cells;
a selectivity index toward the transformed phenotype is given in Table S5, SI. Given that 6 showed
high activity against the A375 melanoma cells, this cell line was
used to determine the mechanism of the cytotoxic effect of ketoprofen
analogue 6. To determine the main cause of decreased
cell viability, the influence of 6 on cell division and
cell death was investigated. As presented in Figure 4A, cell division was inhibited upon 48 h
treatment of A375 cells with 6. Within the same period,
only 5% of double-positive, late-apoptotic cells were determined suggesting
only a symbolic contribution of that type of cell death to decreased
viability in response to compound 6 (Figure 4B). Accordingly, only a small
amplification of total caspase activity was observed after the treatment
(Figure 4C). Given
that minor apoptosis usually correlates with autophagic processes,
the cells were examined for the presence of autophagosomes. Indeed,
enhanced autophagy was detected by flow cytometry after acridine orange
(AO) staining in response to the treatment with 6 (Figure 4D). In fact, it is
well documented that apoptosis and autophagy confront each other,
but under some circumstances, autophagy becomes a regular way of cell
death, so it can contribute to the cytotoxicity of compound 6.44

Figure 4 Mechanism of the cytotoxic
action of 6 against A375
cells. Cells were exposed to 6 for 48 h, and cell proliferation
(A), presence of apoptosis by Ann/propidium iodide (PI) (Annexin V-fluorescein
isothiocyanate (FITC)/propidium iodide) double staining (B), caspase
activation by apostat (C), and autophagy by AO staining (D) were assessed
by flow cytometry. Treatments with 6 are presented as
black-lined histograms and controls as gray histograms.

It has been reported that ketoprofen induced oxidative
damage of
gastrointestinal mucosa,48 and it was attempted
to circumvent this damage by incorporating an NO-releasing moiety
based on the cytoprotective, prostaglandin-like properties of NO.6 Since 6 is designed to be an NO-releasing
ketoprofen analogue, the level of intracellular as well as extracellular
NO in response to the treatment was determined. The release of NO
from a nitrate moiety is a three-electron reduction that is normally
catalyzed by multiple possible enzymes.49 However, compound 6 was found not to affect the intracellular
amount of NO in A375 cells (Figure 5A). Having in mind that A375 cells are able to produce
NO, it can be concluded that compound 6 neither liberated
NO nor changed endogenous production of this molecule in the melanoma
cell line. Given that NO donors also release NO extracellularly and
that the absence of intracellular NO release is not a proof that a
compound is not able to liberate NO at all, spontaneous as well as
the extracellular release of NO from 6 was measured.
Release of NO in the extracellular compartment is typically determined
by the Griess reaction that measures the resultant nitrite accumulation.50,51 Nitrite accumulation was measured in culture medium, conditioned
culture medium (medium taken from cell cultures upon incubation for
72 h) that contains soluble cellular products or cell debris, as well
as in the supernatants from A375 cells that were exposed to 6 (10–40 μM) for 48 h. However, the determined
nitrite accumulation was at the detection limit of the Griess reaction
(1.5 μM), even at the highest applied dose, suggesting that 6 did not release NO in the extracellular compartment. Moreover,
the production of reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species
(ROS/RNS) was measured employing dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR). Indeed,
ROS/RNS production was elevated after the exposure to 6 (Figure 5B), indicating
that the compound promoted oxidative stress, which correlates with
the fact that cell lines highly susceptible to oxidative stress were
affected most by 6.

Intracellular NO (A) and ROS/RNS production (B) were measured after
incubation with 6 for 48 h by flow cytometry. Treatments

3 Conclusions
We report the synthesis of two carboranyl analogues of ketoprofen
bearing an ortho- or meta-carborane
(3 and 4), as well as derivatives additionally
bearing nitrate moieties (5 and 6). The ortho-carborane nitrate ester 5 showed weak
COX inhibitory activity. On the other hand, compound 6, the meta-carborane analogue of 5,
exhibited cytotoxic activity toward colon and melanoma cancer cell
lines in the micromolar range with a special effect on the A375 cell
line. It was determined that the cytotoxic effect is due to its potential
to promote autophagy and oxidative stress in cells. Further research
should provide better insights into the mechanism of action and the
molecular targets of the ketoprofen analogue 6.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Syntheses
4.1.1 Materials and Methods
All commercial
reagents and solvents were used without further purification. Reactions
including carboranes were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere
using the standard Schlenk technique. Compounds 2, 4, and 6 were synthesized with 10B-enriched m-carborane. For column chromatography, silica gel (60 Å)
from the company ACROS was used. The particle size was in the range
of 0.035–0.070 mm. Thin-layer chromatography was used to monitor
the reaction process of the syntheses. For this purpose, glass plates
coated with silica gel plates 60 F254 from the company MERCK were
used. Carborane-containing substances were stained with a 5% solution
of palladium chloride in methanol (MeOH). All received 1H, 13C, and 11B NMR spectra were recorded with
an ADVANCE DRX 400 spectrometer from BRUKER. The chemical shifts are
reported in parts per million (ppm). Quaternary carbons (e.g. substituted
cluster carbon atoms) were not always observed because of their long
relaxation time. The melting points were determined in glass capillaries
using a GALLENKAMP apparatus and were uncorrected. IR spectra were
obtained using an FTIR spectrometer (GENESIS ATI, Mattson/Unicam)
in the range of 400–4000 cm–1 in KBr. High-resolution
mass spectra in the positive or negative mode were recorded with a
BRUKER Daltonics APEX II FT-ICR spectrometer. For these measurements,
dichloromethane, acetonitrile (ACN), methanol (MeOH), formic acid
(FA), or a mixture of these solvents was used.

Compounds 1–6 were obtained and employed as racemic
mixtures.

4.1.2 Synthesis of 2-[3-(1,2-Dicarba-closo-dodecaboranoyl)phenyl]propionitrile (1)
o-Carborane (0.0144 mol, 1.64 g) was
dissolved in a mixture
of dry Et2O and toluene (1:1). To this solution, 7.6 mL
of n-BuLi (1 equiv) was added dropwise at −40
°C. The reaction mixture was stirred at −40 °C for
1 h. Separately, 3-(1-cyanoethyl)benzoyl chloride was prepared by
refluxing 2 g (0.0144 mol) of 3-(1-cyanoethyl)benzoic acid in SOCl2 (10 mL) for 1 h. Excess SOCl2 was removed under
reduced pressure, and the acid halide was dissolved in 10 mL of dry
diethyl ether. The solution of lithiated m-carborane
was then added dropwise at −40 °C to the solution of 3-(1-cyanoethyl)benzoyl
chloride, and the reaction was left to slowly warm to room temperature
overnight. The reaction mixture was washed with 2 M HCl. The organic
phase was collected, dried over MgSO4, and the solvent
was removed under reduced pressure to yield a yellow viscous oil.
Purification was carried out by column chromatography (n-hexane/ethyl acetate 4:1). This gave compound 1 as
a colorless solid. Yield: 32% (1.4 g, 4.6 mmol); mp: 69–70

10 mL of 6 M HCl. The solution was left to reflux overnight and then
it was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3. The resulting

4.2 Cell Viability Materials
and Methods
4.1.8 Reagents and Cells
Reagents were
for the most part obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Annexin V-FITC
(AnnV) was obtained from Biotium (Hayward, CA), and apostat was from
R&D (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). The melanoma cell lines
A375, B16 and its metastatic subclone B16F10 as well as the colon
cancer cell lines HCT116, SW480, and CT26CL25 were cultivated in 10%
fetal calf serum (FCS) Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)-1640
medium with 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.01% sodium pyruvate, and
antibiotics at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Upon trypsinization, cells were seeded in a certain number:
2.5 × 103 cells/well for 96-well plates and viability
assessment and 2 × 104 cells/well for 24-well plates
and flow-cytometric analysis. C57BL/6 mice, obtained from the animal
facility at The Institute for Biological Research “Siniša
Stanković”, were sacrificed for isolation of peritoneal
resident macrophages. For viability assessment, cells were isolated
by peritoneal lavage, washed, counted, seeded in 96-well plates and
incubated overnight before drug application. Before treatment, nonadherent
cells were removed. Carborane-based ketoprofen analogues were dissolved
in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at −20 °C for
a month. 10% FCS–RPMI-1640 working solutions were prepared
before the experiment started. In each experiment, control cultures
were exposed to equal amounts of DMSO.

4.1.9 Cell
Viability Tests
For viability
assessment, two of the most frequently used tests were employed: (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide) (MTT) and crystal violet (CV). Cells were exposed to 3–6 in a wide range of doses for a certain
time interval, and the number of viable cells was determined as described.52 Nontreated cells were arbitrarily set to 100%,
and according to this, results were expressed as the percentage of
control.

4.1.10 Annexin V-FITC/PI, Acridine
Orange Staining,
and Caspase Detection
A375 cells were treated with 6 for 48 h and, after trypsinization, stained with Annexin
V-FITC (Ann)/propidium iodide (PI) or apostat as proposed by the manufacturer.
To evaluate the presence of acidic vesicles, markers of autophagy,
in the cytoplasm of cells, after-treatment staining with a 10 μM
AO solution for 15 min at 37 °C was done. At the end of incubation,
cells were washed and finally resuspended in phosphate buffer solution
(PBS). At the end of all staining procedures, cells were analyzed
with CyFlow Space Partec using the PartecFloMax software.

4.1.11 Cell Staining with Carboxyfluorescein Succinimidyl
Ester (CFSE)
For cell division rate determination, cells
were prestained with carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester
(CFSE) (1 μM) for 10 min at 37 °C. After dye removal, cells
were exposed to an IC50 dose of 6 and 48 h
later analyzed by CyFlow Space Partec using the PartecFloMax.

4.1.12 Measurement of Intracellular Nitric Oxide
4-Amino-5-methylamino-2′,7′-difluorofluorescein
diacetate
(DAF-FM, 5 μM) was used for quantification of the intracellular
level of NO. After an incubation time of 48 h, the cells were incubated
in phenol-red-free RPMI containing DAF-FM for 1 h at 37 °C, washed,
and additionally incubated for 15 min in serum/phenol-red-free conditions
to complete de-esterification of intracellular diacetate. Cells were
resuspended in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) and analyzed as described.

4.1.13 Measurement of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen
Species (ROS) and Reactive Nitrogen Species (RNS)
Dihydrorhodamine-123
(DHR) (1 μM) was used for detection of ROS/RNS production. To
determinate the influence of 6 on the redox status of
A375 cells, they were stained with DHR dye for 20 min prior to exposure
to an IC50 dose of 6. After 48 h, cells were
collected, washed, and resuspended in PBS and analyzed with CyFlow
Space Partec using PartecFloMax.

4.1.14 Nitrite
Detection
For detection
of NO release in the culture supernatant, nitrite accumulation, as
an indicator of NO production, was measured after 48 h of cultivation
in the presence of 6 using the Griess method.53 For assessment of spontaneous release of nitric
oxide, 6 was diluted in the culture medium or conditioned
medium, collected from cell cultures after three days of incubation.
Certain aliquots of culture supernatants were mixed with the same
volume of the Griess reagent prepared from 0.1% naphthylenediamine
dihydrochloride and 1% sulfanilamide in 5% H3PO4, mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Plates were incubated for 10 min at room
temperature, and the absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate
reader. The nitrite concentration was calculated according to a standard
curve derived from a range of NaNO2 concentrations.

4.1.15 Statistics
The results were obtained
in triplicate. IC50 concentrations were calculated from
at least three independent experiments. The significance of the differences
between various treatments was calculated by the analysis of variance,
followed by the Student–Newman–Keuls test. A p value of less than 0.05 was considered significant in
comparison to untreated control cells.
