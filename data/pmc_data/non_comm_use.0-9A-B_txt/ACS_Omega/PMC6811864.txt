An efficient and quick access toward
a series of (E)-2-arylideneaminopyrroles 6 and to their benzyne-promoted
aza-Diels–Alder cycloaddition products is provided. These products
are three pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c substituted in position 5 with different electron-acceptor (A) or
electron-donor (D) aryl groups. Intermediates and products were obtained
in good yields (up to 78 and 84%, respectively), and their structures
were determined on the basis of NMR measurements and HRMS analysis.
Photophysical properties of 8a–c were investigated,
finding good Stokes shift in different solvents, but only the product 8c showed appreciable fluorescence intensity since its 5-aryl
group (2,4-Cl2Ph) could favor the twisted intramolecular
charge transfer effect. In addition, a riveting relationship between
solvent viscosity and fluorescence intensity was found. Structures
of 6 and 8 were studied and confirmed by
single-crystal X-ray diffraction, observing that their electronic
distributions effect the supramolecular assembly but with only long-distance
hydrophobic interactions. A CE-B3LYP model was used to study the energetic
topology and understand the crystal architecture of compounds as well
as find a connection with both the synthetic and photophysical results.

Introduction
The development of
simple and atom-economical approaches for the
construction of fused N-heterocycles is very important
because of their broad range of applications in medicinal chemistry
and, nowadays, also in chemosensor design.1−3 In particular,
isoquinoline derivatives are found in a plethora of natural products,
pharmaceutical compounds, and organic materials.4−6 Although several
syntheses of this scaffold have been developed, there still remains
a great need to find efficient methodologies for its construction.
Traditional synthesis of isoquinolines include the Bischler–Napieralski,7 Pictet–Spengler,8 and Pomeranz–Fritsch reactions.9 Likewise, the transition metal-catalyzed C–H or C–halogen
bond activation and electrophile-triggered annulation reaction have
enabled an orthogonal access to isoquinolines.10 However, these methods are often limited due to the use
of special additives and/or expensive catalysts, which results in
lower atom efficiency.11 In this sense,
Maulide’s group reported a metal-free selective cycloaddition
between ynamides and nitriles that allowed efficient access to isoquinolines.12 Another elegant approach is based on a metal-free
annulation reaction between secondary eneamides and arynes.13

Regarding the synthesis of fused isoquinolines,
the pyrrolo-fused
derivatives have remained almost unexplored, possibly due to the dearth
of direct approaches to obtain these scaffolds.14 Specifically, pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines
synthesis is quite rare, but Biehl et al. reported the synthesis of
derivative 2a by an acid-promoted cyclization of 4-formylmethylisoquinolin-3-amines 1.15 Likewise, Hajós developed
a TBAF-promoted 5-endo-dig cyclization involving 4-ethynylisoquinoline-3-amines 3 as a viable route to derivative 2b (Scheme 1a).16 A few years ago, we reported the synthesis of the pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinoline 8a as a single example of cycloaddition
between the (E)-arylideneaminopyrrole 6e with the aryne derived from 7 (Scheme 1b,i).17 More recently,
we reported an efficient synthesis and significant structural studies
by X-ray of a series of (E)-arylideneaminopyrroles 6a–c and their reduction products to secondary amines 9a–c via a two-step synthesis sequence (solvent-free
condensation and reduction) starting from 5-amino-1-tert-butyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile (4) and arylaldehydes 5 (Scheme 1b,ii).18

Scheme 1 (E)-Arylideneaminopyrroles 6a–c and Synthesis
of Pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 2 and 8a–c
Inspired by these
earlier studies along with our interest in the
development of efficient protocols for the synthesis of fused N-heterocycles,2,19−23 we envisioned that using our established synthetic sequences17,18 might generate other (E)-arylideneaminopyrroles 6d–h, which would be suitable heterodienes for normal
electron-demand aza-Diels–Alder cycloaddition with benzyne
in situ generated from 7. Thus, reactions with three
heterodienes substituted with different electron-acceptor (A) or electron-donor
(D) groups led to the expected cycloadducts 10a–c that, with later in situ aromatization, provided pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c in high atom economy
and efficiency (Scheme 1c). We report herein a detailed study of the observed molecular conformations
in the solid state of three (E)-arylideneaminopyrroles 6e–g and two pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8b and 8c discussed in terms of their molecular
and supramolecular structures, including the interpretation of their
Hirshfeld surface maps and energy frameworks. Considering the lack
of short contacts in the solid state, the term “weak interactions”
presents, in this work, a special meaning, leaving the interpretation
of the intermolecular contacts necessarily in terms of energetic topology.
In addition, a brief discussion about results of photophysical studies
for compounds 8a–c is presented, which was carried
out due to their fused nature25−27 and our continued interest in
this important property for N-heterocyclic derivatives.24−27

It is important to note that, in the pyrroloisoquinoline moiety
of 8a–c, an intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
process occurs due to the π-excedent character of the pyrrole
ring versus isoquinoline ring (Figure 1a). In addition, since compounds 8a–c are substituted in position 5 with different aryl groups (A or D),
there exist a direct influence over their molecular electronic distribution.
Accordingly, photophysical properties of 8a–c were
explored in order to establish the scope of the pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinoline core as a new organic fluorophore. Additionally,
since the structures of aza-diene intermediates 6 and
products 8 were studied by X-ray diffraction, these analyses
were conveniently related to both the synthetic and photophysical
results. For example, the product 8c (substituted with
the 2,4-Cl2Ph group) showed a fully perpendicular conformation
due to the steric effect that can occur between the Cl atom at position
2 of the aryl group18 and the fused moiety
(Figure 1b). In fact,
only 8c showed appreciable fluorescence intensity (FI)
since, possibly, its aryl group favors a greater twisted intramolecular
charge transfer (TICT) effect.3,27,28

Results and Discussion
Some information about the approach
used for the formation of (E)-arylideneaminopyrroles 6d–h and the
synthesis of the pyrroloisoquinolines 8a–c was
described in our previous works (Scheme 1b).17,18 In this work, we decided
to explore the scope and limits of the solvent-free microwave-assisted
synthesis of 6 with diverse arylaldehydes 5d–h and the 5-aminopyrrole 4 using our previously optimized
conditions.18 Likewise, we carry out the
synthesis of three pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c substituted with different A or D groups by the
aza-Diels–Alder cycloaddition between 6 and 2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl
triflate (7).17 In addition,
we report results about the photophysical properties of the final
products and a wide analysis by X-ray of some pyrrolylimines and pyrroloisoquinolines.
In summary, the discussion of this article includes synthetic results
on nine compounds distributed as follows: six novel compounds (6d, 6f, 6g, 8b, and 8c), three previously reported compounds by us (6b, 6e, and 8a), the photophysical study of the three
fused compounds 8a–c and five novel crystal structures
(6e–g and 8b and 8c)
(Scheme 1c).

In this way, microwave-assisted reactions of 4 with 5d–h at 100 °C for 10 min under solvent-free conditions
enabled the time-efficient formation of the (E)-arylideneaminopyrroles 6d–h in 67–78% yield (Table 1). This protocol was distinguished by its
operational simplicity, broad substrate scope, and short reaction
times, and no solvent, no transition metal catalyst, and no drying
agent were used, rendering the experimental procedure user- and environment-friendly.
The structures of pyrrolylimines 6d–h were confirmed
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and HRMS measurements as
well as by X-ray diffraction analysis (see Experimental
Section and Figures S4–S19).

Continuing our study, we anticipated that aza-dienes 6 would be suitable candidates for cycloadditions with the
aryne precursor 7, affording 1,2-dihydropyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 10, the oxidation of which
would provide a direct route to
the respective pyrroloisoquinolines 8. As a test reaction,
we submitted a mixture of the aza-heterodiene 6a, the
benzyne precursor 7, and cesium fluoride in acetonitrile
at 70 °C for 24 h under oxidative conditions. The excess of MnO2 allowed an efficient in situ oxidation of the cycloadduct 10a to afford the heteroaromatic product 8a in
76% yield, though this cycloaddition was found to be unproductive
at room temperature. Stimulated by this result, we investigated the
scope of the reaction with other two aza-dienes under similar conditions
(Scheme 2). In all
cases, the reaction was found productive, affording compounds 8a–c in good yields. This aza-Diels–Alder/aromatization
reaction sequence between electron-rich heterodienes and an aryne
provided a time-efficient entry to functionalized fused isoquinolines
(see Experimental Section). It is important
to mention that an attempt was made to obtain a 5-(4-diphenylamino)phenyl
derivative in order to find the best optical properties in this product
due to the strong electron-donor character of its 5-aryl group,3,29 but the reaction did not proceed when the heterodiene 6f was used. Possibly, the stereoelectronic effects of the aryl group
at the imine 6f decrease its reactivity with respect
to the aza-Diels–Alder cycloaddition with benzyne.

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of Pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c via aza-Diels–Alder Reactions
All reactions were performed
with 1.0 equiv of heterodiene 6 and 1.2 equiv of the
benzyne precursor 7 using CsF (2.4 equiv) and MnO2 (10 equiv) at 70 °C in ACN for 24 h.

Structures of products 8a–c were elucidated
by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectroscopy and,
gratifyingly, also solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis.
From crystallographic results, it was possible to observe a significant
dihedral angle between the 5-aryl group and the heterocyclic core
of products, which apparently have an important correlation with the
observed fluorescence intensity in 8a–c (Figure 1 and Figure S19). The results and discussion of the
photophysical studies are shown below and after X-ray diffraction
studies are discussed.

Considering the molecular conformations
observed and the special
electronic properties of the fused products 8a–c, the three compounds were selected in order to carry out photophysical
studies and thus establish their scope as novel fluorophores for possible
uses in chemosensors. This study was done since compounds 8a–c have a fused structure substituted in position 5 with different
electron-acceptor or electron-donor aryl groups (i.e., 8a 4-MeOPh, 8b Ph, and 8c 2,4-Cl2Ph), which is crucial in fluorescence phenomena that involve an intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT) process, often observed in various N-heterocycles suitably substituted (see Figure 1). In addition, as it is observed from the
crystallographic structures of 8b and 8c (perfectly extrapolated to 8a considering that no suitable
crystals were obtained; Figure S19), the
tendency in the orientation of aryl groups could favor a TICT phenomenon,
presumably higher in 8c considering that it has a more
pronounced dihedral angle due to its aryl group. The UV–vis
and fluorescence emission spectra of 8a–c were
achieved in cyclohexane (CH), tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane
(DCM), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF),
and acetonitrile (ACN) (Figure 2 and Table 2).

a 30 μM.

b Relative quantum yields were obtained
with anthracene (ϕF = 0.28 in ethanol) as the reference.

In general, UV–vis spectra
of 8a–c show
two bands around 255 and 345 nm with absorptivity coefficients ε
ranging from 21,000 M–1 cm–1 (255
nm) to 8300 M–1 cm–1 (345 nm).
When 8a–c are excited at their λab in an air-equilibrated solution at 298 K, they exhibit emission
bands around 400 nm. The poor solvatochromic effect observed in both
absorption and emission spectra and the short Stokes shift indicate
that a small structural reorganization occur in these compounds when
going from the ground to the excited state but without strong changes
in the dipole moment. These properties indicate that there is no great
ICT process in these compounds, which means that the absorption bands
come essentially from n → π and π → π*
transitions.30 As expected, the compound 8c exhibit higher fluorescence quantum yield (ϕF) versus 8a and 8b, which reflect
an important effect of the dihedral angle (°) between the 5-aryl
and heterocyclic moieties on the photophysical properties; thus, the
2,4-Cl2Ph group on 8c would favor a greater
TICT effect, which is very sensitive to D–A efficacy, strength,
and steric hindrance caused by substituents near the D–A junction,27,28 such as the Cl atom at position 2 of the 5-aryl group (see Figure 1b).

On the
other hand, an interesting behavior was observed when high
polar and viscous solvents were used. In all cases, no matter the
5-aryl group, the fluorescence intensity decreases dramatically when
DMF was used as a solvent (e.g., for 8c, ϕF = 0.015 in CH, 0.010 in DCM, and 0.001 in DMF). This behavior
reflects a high dependence of the FI with the dihedral angle between
the 5-aryl group and the heterocyclic core. A possible explanation
could be found in the relationship between the rotations of rotators
in the molecule, which is gradually modified by changing the viscosity
of the media, resulting in enhanced/decreased FI (i.e., increasing
FI lifetime).31 Therefore, the λem has almost no change when the solvent polarity varies dramatically.
Based on their structural and photophysical properties, the pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8 could be an interesting alternative
for fluorescent molecular rotors (FMRs).32 Importantly, and due to the effect of the dihedral angle on the
photophysical properties, corroborated by the crystal structure resolution,
and the possibility of change the substituents in the periphery, these
properties could be enhanced by an appropriate substitution pattern
of this heterocyclic core.

Regarding the crystallographic discussion,
since the structures
of 6e–g and 8b and 8c were solved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis,33 the molecular and supramolecular details of
these five compounds were studied. The absence of short contacts to
describe correctly the crystals made necessary a deeper analysis using
Hirshfeld surfaces and CE-B3LYP model energies. In addition, we found
an important connection of these analyses with both the synthetic
and photophysical results. Crystal data details are summarized in Table 3 (see also Table S1). In general, the crystal structures
of pyrrolylimines 6e–g show an interesting role
of their aryl groups (4-MeOPh, 4-Ph2NPh, or 4-FPh) in the
molecular conformations, showing different electronic distributions
in the imine group (blue boxes in Figure 3a–c). Likewise, the molecular conformation
observed in pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c is a consequence of a stable orientation presented by the 5-aryl
group, which is maintained once the compounds start the nucleation
process in their trajectory to build the crystal (Figure 3d,e). As it is known, the molecular
conformation plays an important role in features such as physical
properties or biological activities.5,27

In this
sense, the aryl group effect in 6e–g is noticed
in the dihedral angles between the least-squares mean
planes made by the pyrrole and benzene rings. In 6e,
the dihedral angle along the azomethine fragment (C—N=C—C, Figure 3a) is −179.92(14)°,
and the bond distance between the C atom of the pyrrolic ring and
the N atom of the imine group has a value of 1.386(2) Å. This
evidences a greater resonance effect in 6e as result
of the electron-donor character of its MeO group, a structural property
not seen in 6f and 6g (conformational effects)
where the bond lengths are 1.398(3) and 1.395(3) Å, respectively.
These findings suggest that groups of proper electronic nature could
regulate the resonance properties in 6e–g. Considering
that the same interactions are detected in all the molecules (C–H···N
between the tBu group and the N atom of the azomethine
group), the diverse conformations seem to be independent of other
factors (i.e., intramolecular hydrogen bonds). Regarding 8a–c, its 5-aryl group is connected to the pyrroloisoquinolinic core
by sp2 carbon atoms generating bond lengths of 1.487(5)
and 1.492(3) Å for 8b and 8c, respectively,
which suggests distances deviated from expected values for free rotational
bonds as a consequence of hybridization effects (Figure 3d,e; see also Scheme 2). The two conformations for
these compounds are characterized by dihedral angles observed in Figure 3d,e.

In the
supramolecular assembly of 6e–g, no
classic hydrogen bonds were found, and only weak hydrogen interactions
were detected based on the intermolecular H···(O, N)
lengths. In 6e, pairs of inversion-related molecules
are connected by two equivalent weak C–H···Oi (2.65 Å; (i) 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z) hydrogen interactions,
involving one methyl in the tBu group (Figure 4a). These pairs are the slabs
of infinite chains running along the [−111] direction and connected
by weaker C–H···Nii (2.78 Å;
(ii) 1 – x, 2 – y,
2 – z) interactions, involving the CN and
MeO groups. The three-dimensional (3D) assembly is completed by C–H···Oiii (2.76 Å; (iii) 2 – x, 2 – y, 1 – z) hydrogen interactions,
joining molecules by the connection between tBu and
MeO groups in adjacent molecules along the a axis
(Figure 4a). In 6f, the formation of weak C–H···Ni,ii interactions involving the tBu (2.71
Å; (i) x, 3/2 – y, −1/2
+ z) and triphenylamine (TPA) (2.72 Å; (ii)
1 – x, −1/2 + y, 3/2
– z) groups builds the solid forming chains
running along the [010] direction. These chains are further connected
in the three dimensions by the same sort of C–H···N
contacts forming a framework that seems solely dependent on these
connections (Figure 4b). In 6g, the presence of a F atom over the aryl group
allows the connection of pairs of inversion-related molecules (by
C–H···Fi; 2.72 Å; (i) 1 + x, y, 1 + z) connected
by two equivalent C–H···Nii (2.68
Å; (ii) 1 – x, 1 – y, 2 – z) hydrogen interactions. As it was
observed in 6e and 6f, the CN group interacts
with the azomethine (in C–H···Nii) and tBu groups, C–H···Niii (2.72 Å; (iii) 2 – x, 1 – y, 2 – z), forming bifurcated hydrogen
interactions building (010) sheets, which are further connected in
the [010] direction by van der Waals forces (Figure 4c).

and (c) 6g showing the C–H···O,
C–H···N, and C–H···F hydrogen-bond
interactions. The (i), (ii), and (iii) codes serve as a reference
with the description in the text.

Hirshfeld (HF) surface analysis mapped over dnorm (analysis of the contact distances di and de from the HF surface to
the nearest atom inside and outside, respectively) was performed in
order to investigate these contacts further. In 6e, the
bright red spots over dnorm corresponds
exclusively to the C–H···O (2.65 Å; 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z) hydrogen interactions showing that C–H···N
interactions are not relevant (Figure S20a). On the other hand, C–H···N interactions
are clearly, but weakly, observed in the HF surface for 6f, showing that, in this crystal, they are “close contacts”
compared with the remaining interactions. Additional C–H···π
interactions (3.38 Å) were detected between the tBu group and one Ph group of 6f (Figure S20b). In 6g, the red spots are showing
mainly the C–H···N contacts, leaving other contacts
with nearly nonobservable spots; including C–H···F
(Figure S20c). In the 2D fingerprint plots,
H···N/N···H contacts comprise 12–17%
of the total HF surface in 6e–g, which is not
the highest effect to the crystal structure. In all compounds, no
close (<2.6 Å) contacts are observed, showing the absence
of strong hydrogen bonds in the blue/white regions on the HF surfaces.
The nonbonded H···H (40–57%) contacts suggest
a principal role of long-range hydrophobic interaction in the formation
of the crystals.

Energy framework representations of the intermolecular
interactions
were computed using the CE-B3LYP model, which serves to interpret
the topological architecture of the supramolecular features from an
energetic perspective, considering the difficulty to interpret the
formation of the crystal based on long hydrogen contacts (Figure 5). The strongest
interaction in 6e is not related to the closest C–H···O
(2.65 Å; 1 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z) hydrogen contact as expected from
the atom–atom analysis. Instead, the strongest contacts form
chains of molecules connected by total interaction energies of −36.6
kJ mol–1 along the [100] direction connected between
them by interaction energies of −37.9 and −32.1 kJ mol–1 along the [011] direction with contributions from
electrostatic and dispersion energies in similar magnitudes (Figure 5a and Table S2). The energy framework describes an
anisotropic topology, showing that the crystal is formed mainly by
dispersion forces along the a axis. These chains
of molecules are connected between them by a combination of electrostatic
(only important in the connection of the chains along [011] by the
azomethine fragments, red framework) and dispersion contributions
forming the 3D structure (Figure 5a). The topology is characterized by the formation
of layers stacked along the [01-1] direction.

Figure 5 Description of molecular
close contacts and energy framework diagrams
for electrostatic (red) and dispersion (green) contributions to the
total interaction energies (blue) in compounds (a) 6e, (b) 6f, and (c) 6g.

The interaction energies for selected molecular pairs in the first
coordination sphere around the asymmetric unit for 6e–g are summarized in Table S2. As it is
observed, the dispersion terms contribute in high proportion to the
formation of the crystals, explaining the absence of short hydrogen
contacts due to the electronic distributions that do not allow a great
nucleophilicity over O and N atoms and the absence of acidic hydrogen
atoms. Additionally, the highest total energies are observed in 6f, which is related to the highest thermal stability compared
with 6e and 6g, considering that their melting
points are 142–143, 181–182, and 138–139 °C
for 6e–g, respectively. As it was observed previously,
these framework energies are comparable with the experimental sublimation
enthalpies.34

As observed in 6e–g, the hydrogen C–H···N
interactions involving the nitrile group are weak, with distances
greater than 2.6 Å rather difficult to detect without using Hirshfeld
surfaces. In 8b, one possibility for such contacts is
observed in Figure 6a. However, this weak C–H···Ni contact
has a length of 2.92 Å ((i) 1/2 + x, 3/2 – y, z), leaving this interaction as not
relevant. The planar conformation on the pyrroloisoquinolinic core
allows the formation of π···πii (3.740(2) Å; (ii) 1/2 + x, 3/2 – y, z) stacking contacts (Figure 6a). These interactions form
chains of molecules along the [100] direction. Hirshfeld surface shows
a complete lack of short contacts, leaving the map without red spots
and only blue regions, suggesting that the crystal is formed only
by long-distance hydrophobic interactions despite the presence of
potential donor/acceptor regions in the molecule as it is observed
in the electrostatic potential map in Figure S21a.

Figure 6 Crystal structures of (a) 8b and (b, c) 8c showing the C–H···N and C–H···π
hydrogen-bond interactions and π···π stacking
contacts. The (i), (ii) and (iii) codes serve as reference with the
description in the text.

In 8c, the
nitrile group has bifurcated weak C–H···N
contacts with the pyrrolici and 2,4-dichlorophenyli rings (2.74 Å, (i) −x, −y, 1 – z), forming chains of molecules
along [100] (Figure 6b). C–H···π interactions play an important
role in the crystal with contacts involving also the pyrrolicii and 2,4-dichloreophenyliii rings as hydrogen
acceptors (2.73 Å, (ii) 1 + x, y, z; 2.91 Å, (iii) 2 – x, 1 – y, 1 – z) (Figure 6c). Hirshfeld surface
analysis shows that the C–H···π interaction
involving the pyrrolicii ring also has another connotation.
The H···N distance has a value 2.75 Å, and the
C–H···N angle is 159°, indicating an interaction
between the H atom and the nonhybridized 2p atomic orbital in the
pyrrolic N atom that in fact is perpendicular to the plane of the
ring and is part of the π cloud. This bifurcated interaction,
C–H···π and C–H···N,
is observed as a doublet spot over the HF surface (Figure S21b).

Another interesting interaction is detected
in the HF surface involving
a Me group from the tBu group and the C atom placed
between the substituent halogens in the aryl group of 8c. Due to the geometry (H···C distance of 2.81 Å
and C–H···C angle of 156°), this contact
could be understood as a C–H···C interaction,
which is not frequently reported (Figure S21b). The contact is possible due to the sp2 hybridization
of the C atom that allows the interaction of the H atom with the perpendicular
pure 2p orbital overlapped in the π cloud. The 2D fingerprints
show that, essentially, the crystal in 8b is mainly built
by hydrophobic interactions with H···H contacts comprising
56% of the total HF surface (Figure S21a). Despite the suggestion of other interactions, such as H···N,
they showed to be very large in 8b and thus irrelevant
in the supramolecular assembly. In 8c, the 2D fingerprint
plot shows that H···N interactions comprise 13% of
the HF surface (Figure S21b). In this case,
the H···H contacts are less relevant (35%) compared
with 8b, suggesting a less hydrophobic character.

In order to obtain a better understanding of the crystal packing,
the CE-B3LYP model was used to investigate the supramolecular assembly
in terms of energy frameworks (Table S3). In 8b, the strongest pairwise interactions have a
total energy value −60.9 kJ mol–1, forming
chains of molecules along the [100] direction interacting by the fused
heterocyclic moiety in a π···π stacking
disposition (Figure 7a). Considering the high stabilization in this direction, it is possible
to assume that the short distance among adjacent centroids (5.72 Å)
is due to dispersion forces. In fact, this term contributes mainly
to this interaction, showing that these forces are responsible for
assembling along the a axis instead of particular
atom–atom contacts. The second strongest interactions connect
these chains along the [001] direction with −22.7 kJ mol–1 as the total energy, which is also represented in
higher proportion by the dispersion term. The energy frameworks show
a curious topology. Electrostatic forces act to keep the molecules
assembled along the a axis (Figure 7a). Observing the closeness of neighboring
molecules due to dispersion forces along this [100] direction, the
electrostatic term rises due to the short distance between heterocyclic-fused
rings where some degree of electronic polarization exists. However,
the dispersion forces are the most important interactions in the crystal,
forming (001) sheets stacked along the c axis and
building a 3D structure by less energetic interactions giving an anisotropic
tendency.

Figure 7 Description of molecular close contacts and energy framework diagrams
for electrostatic (red) and dispersion (green) contributions to the
total interaction energies (blue) in compounds (a) 8b and (b) 8c.

In 8c, the strongest pairwise interactions occur between
the nearest (7.39 Å) molecules involving the pyrroloisoquinolinic
moieties oriented in a parallel form, allowing a total energy value
of −62.9 kJ mol–1 (Figure 7b and Table S3). Similar to 8b, the dispersion term contributes in
higher proportion to the interaction, showing the importance of the
π cloud in the pyrroloisoquinolinic core to build “strong”
dispersion attractions in this sort of structures. Other molecules
are connected by total energies such as −38.9 and −31.8
kJ mol–1 in which the dispersion term always represents
the most important interaction. The energy frameworks show similar
electrostatic interactions as observed in 8b, forming
chains along the [100] direction with a curious zigzag topology joining
the fused heterocyclic rings. The dispersion-cylinder magnitudes show
an isotropic structure built by the strongest interactions forming
a sort of compacted scaffolding structure. Between the strong pillars,
other diagonal cylinders of low magnitude are present acting between
halogen atoms, which does not mean an actual absence but a low energetic
contact by a possible repulsion between close electron shells (Figure 7b) compared with 8b, suggesting a less hydrophobic character.

In order
to have a deeper insight into the electronic properties
for the studied compounds and achieve a better connection of the experimental
results, the energy levels of the electron-donor HOMO (highest occupied
molecular orbital) and electron-acceptor LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular
orbital) for aza-dienes 6c,186e–g, and products 8b and 8c were computed (Figure 8). These calculations were carried out through the
STO-3G basis set at the Hartree–Fock level of theory implemented
in CrystalExplorer35 using the crystallographic
information files (.cif) obtained from the X-ray diffraction measurements.
In the analyzed aza-dienes, the electron densities in the frontier
molecular orbitals (FMO) are mostly localized over the whole of the
molecules (except the tBu group), especially over
the pyrrolylimine and aryl fragments (Figure 8a).

Figure 8 Computed energy levels HOMO and LUMO for aza-dienes
(a) 6c and 6e–g and (b) products 8b and 8c using the crystallographic information
files (.cif) by
the STO-3G basis set at the Hartree–Fock level of theory.

The HOMO–LUMO energy gaps suggest that 6g and 6f are the less and more reactive molecules
toward electrophilic
reagents, respectively. These results are consistent with the strong
electron-donor character of the 5-aryl group in 6f,3,28 though FMO can be affected by the solvent, which could shift the
electron density in the FMO from one fragment to another.36 Remarkably, the HOMO in 6f has
a poor contribution (low electronic density) in the aza-dienic moiety
versus the other imines analyzed (6c, 6e, and 6g), which could explain the poor reactivity of 6f (mentioned above) with respect to the aza-Diels–Alder
reaction with benzyne (yellow circle in Figure 8a). In 8b and 8c, the electron densities are mostly localized over the pyrroloisoquinolinic
fragment; however, the HOMO in 8c present lower electronic
density over the 2,4-dichlorophenyl group as a consequence of the
marked dihedral angle (75.01(8)°) between this aryl group with
the pyrroloisoquinolinic fragment, as mentioned earlier in the crystallographic
results. Consequently, the charge transfer from the pyrroloisoquinolinic
core to 2,4-dichlorophenyl group could be better observed upon photoexcitation
of 8c (yellow circle in Figure 8b).37 These findings
confirm that the fluorescence phenomenon of 8c is governed
by a TICT mechanism.3,27,28

Conclusions
In summary, we have established a general synthetic
access to various
(E)-2-arylideneaminopyrroles 6, which
served as key intermediates of some pyrrolo[2,3-c]isoquinolines 8a–c through the aryne aza-Diels–Alder
cycloaddition. Both intermediates and final products were obtained
in good yields (up to 78 and 84%, respectively), their structures
were determined on the basis of NMR measurements and HRMS analysis,
and pleasantly, the structures were confirmed by single-crystal X-ray
diffraction analyses. The fused N-heterocycles 8a–c are substituted in position 5 with aryl groups
of different electronic nature; thus, their photophysical properties
were investigated, finding absorption bands with a non-ICT character
and a fluorescence intensity sensible to the dihedral angle between
the 5-aryl group and the heterocyclic core. Interestingly, we find
a relationship between viscosity and the solvent with the fluorescence
intensity of these kinds of compounds, this property could be very
useful for fluorescence molecular rotor (FMR) applications. On the
other hand, the crystallographic results show that all the interactions
found in 6e–g and 8b and 8c are weak, and van der Waals forces seem to be the main responsible
for the solid formation. The analysis of individual interatomic interactions
and the difficult search for hydrogen bonds did not allow a rational
description of the crystal formation. However, using the CE-B3LYP
model, in addition to studying the energetic topology and understanding
the crystal architecture of compounds, we managed to find an important
connection with both the synthetic and photophysical results.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise
noted. All starting materials were weighed and handled in air at room
temperature. The reactions were monitored by TLC and visualized by
UV (254 nm). Column and flash chromatography was performed on silica
gel (230–400 mesh or 70–230 mesh, respectively). All
reactions under microwave irradiation were performed using a sealed
reaction vessel (10 mL, max pressure = 300 psi) containing a Teflon-coated
stirring bar (obtained from CEM). Microwave-assisted reactions were
performed in a CEM Discover focused microwave (ν = 2.45 GHz)
reactor equipped with a built-in pressure measurement sensor and a
vertically focused IR temperature sensor; controlled temperature,
power, and time settings were used for all reactions. NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C) at 298 K. NMR spectroscopic data were recorded in CDCl3 and DMSO-d6 using, as internal standards,
the residual nondeuterated signal for 1H NMR and the deuterated
solvent signal for 13C NMR spectroscopy. DEPT spectra were
used for the assignment of carbon signals. Chemical shifts (δ)
are given in ppm and coupling constants (J) are given
in Hz. The following abbreviations are used for multiplicities: s
= singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, and m = multiplet. Melting points
were collected using a Stuart SMP10 melting point apparatus, and the
acquired data are uncorrected. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS)
were recorded using an Agilent Technologies Q-TOF 6520 spectrometer
by electrospray ionization (ESI). 5-Amino-1-(tert-butyl)-1H-pyrrole-3-carbonitrile 4 was prepared using a known procedure.38 The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission spectra were
recorded in quartz cuvettes having a path length of 1 cm. UV–vis
and emission measurements were achieved at room temperature (20 °C).
For fluorescence measurements, both the excitation and the emission
slit widths were 5 nm.

solvatochromic studies of the compounds 8a–c were
carried out from 50 μM stock solutions in cyclohexane (CH),

Refinement
Crystal
data, data collection, and structure
refinement details are summarized in Table S1. Single crystals of the compounds were obtained by recrystallization
from methanol and mounted in oil. The X-ray diffraction intensity
data were measured at room temperature (298(2) K) with an Agilent
SuperNova, Dual, Cu at zero, Atlas four-circle diffractometer equipped
with a CCD plate detector. In the data acquisition, a Mo microfocus
sealed tube was used (λ = 0.71073 Å). The collected frames
were integrated with the CrysAlisPro software package (Agilent Technologies,
version 1.171.37.35). Data were corrected for the absorption effect
using the same CrysAlisPro software package by the empirical absorption
correction using spherical harmonics implemented in the SCALE3 ABSPACK
scaling algorithm. The structure was solved using an iterative algorithm39 and subsequently completed by a difference Fourier
map. All the hydrogen atoms, with H-atom parameters constrained during
refinements, were placed in calculated positions (C–H = 0.93–0.96
Å) and included as riding contributions with isotropic displacement
parameters set at 1.2–1.5 times the Ueq value of the parent atom. The crystal structures were refined
using the program SHELXL2014.40 The graphic
material was prepared using the software Mercury 3.8.41 In the structural calculations, the software PLATON was
used.42

Computational Methods
Hirshfeld (HF) surface analysis43 mapped
over dnorm (analysis of the contact distances di and de from the
HF surface to the nearest
atom inside and outside, respectively) was calculated in order to
investigate the close contacts further which are observed as bright
red spots over dnorm. Electrostatic potentials
were calculated using TONTO, a Fortran-based object-oriented system
for quantum chemistry and crystallography,44,45 and subsequently mapped over the HF surface using the STO-3G basis
set at the Hartree–Fock level of theory over the range of ±0.14
a.u. Energy frameworks describing the intermolecular interaction energies
were computed based on CE-B3LYP interaction energies (kJ mol–1), which use B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) molecular wave functions calculated
applying the crystal symmetry obtained from X-ray results, which include
electrostatic (Eele), polarization (Epol), dispersion (Edis), and exchange-repulsion (Erep) terms.46 Computed energies between molecular pairs are
represented using cylinders joining the centroids (centers of mass)
of the molecules with a radius proportional to the magnitude of the
interaction. The calculations were performed using the models implemented
in CrystalExplorer.35
