Compounds with multitarget activity
(promiscuity) are increasingly
sought in drug discovery. However, promiscuous compounds are often
viewed controversially in light of potential assay artifacts that
may give rise to false-positive activity annotations. We have reasoned
that the strongest evidence for true multitarget activity of small
molecules would be provided by experimentally determined structures
of ligand–target complexes. Therefore, we have carried out
a systematic search of currently available X-ray structures for compounds
forming complexes with different targets. Rather unexpectedly, 1418
such crystallographic ligands were identified, including 702 that
formed complexes with targets from different protein families (multifamily
ligands). About half of these multifamily ligands originated from
the medicinal chemistry literature, making it possible to consider
additional target annotations and search for analogues. From 168 distinct
series of analogues containing one or more multifamily ligands, 133
unique analogue-series-based scaffolds were isolated that can serve
as templates for the design of new compounds with multitarget activity.
As a part of our study, all of the multifamily ligands we have identified
and the analogue-series-based scaffolds are made freely available.

1 Introduction
Over the past decade,
the interest in small molecules with multitarget
activity has been steadily on the rise,1−3 especially in the context
of polypharmacology.4−7 This concept refers to increasing evidence that the efficacy of
drugs frequently depends on engagement of multiple therapeutic targets.4−7 Accordingly, the molecular foundation of polypharmacology, which
also includes undesired side effects, is provided by specific interactions
of compounds with multiple targets.8 However,
while multitarget drug discovery is given prime consideration in therapeutic
areas such as neurodegenerative diseases3 and oncology,9 compound promiscuity per
se is often viewed controversially.8 This
is the case because it is generally difficult to draw the line between
true multitarget activity of small molecules8 and aggregation effects or potential reactivity under assay conditions,10−13 which may or may not14,15 lead to artifacts and false-positive
assay signals.13,16,17 Hence, differentiating between multitarget activity and assay interference
has become a major task in biological screening and medicinal chemistry.17 In addition to their drug discovery relevance,
small molecules with true multitarget activity are also of high interest
for basic research in order to explore why and how such chemical entities
are capable of forming specific interactions with multiple targets,
especially if these targets are only distantly related or unrelated
and have different functions.

We have been interested in identifying
compounds that are active
against target proteins from different families. In light of potential
caveats associated with promiscuity analysis (vide supra), we have
reasoned that particularly strong evidence and support for multitarget
activity would be provided by structural data confirming that compounds
are indeed bound to active sites of different target proteins. Therefore,
we have carried out a systematic search for X-ray structures of ligands
bound to multiple target proteins from different families. This search
was complemented by identifying and analyzing series of analogues
involving such ligands, thereby bridging between structural biology
and medicinal chemistry.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Crystallographic Ligands
From 102 625
entries in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB),18 23 580 crystallographic ligands were extracted, which included
11 039 organic compounds with a molecular weight of at least
300 Da and unique structures. This subset of PDB ligands provided
the basis for our analysis. The complete selection protocol is summarized
in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Compound selection.
The protocol applied to select crystallographic
ligands, multitarget and multifamily ligands, and analogues from medicinal
chemistry is summarized.

2.2 Multitarget and Multifamily Ligands
The selected PDB ligands were found to contain 1418 compounds from
X-ray structures of complexes with at least two different target proteins
(i.e., multitarget ligands; Figure 1). We then determined that these multitarget ligands
contained a subset of 702 compounds whose crystallographic targets
originated from different families (i.e., multifamily ligands; Figure 1). For this subset,
the median value was three targets per ligand. Multifamily ligands
were most interesting to us because their structurally confirmed targets
were only distantly related (if not unrelated). Targets of multifamily
ligands included 488 human proteins, which were distributed across
different families as shown in Figure 2. The majority of targets were enzymes. Among these,
transferases were prevalent. This observation can be explained by
considering that the composition of the PDB is biased toward targets
that are straightforward to crystallize (such as many cytoplasmic
enzymes). Consequently, some major classes of pharmaceutical targets
such as G-protein-coupled receptors and other membrane proteins continue
to be under-represented in the PDB. It is possible to compensate this
inherent target bias in part by mapping of multifamily ligands from
the PDB to ChEMBL and searching for additional target annotations
of these ligands and available structural analogues from medicinal
chemistry, as further discussed below.

Figure 2 Distribution of human
targets of multifamily ligands. The pie chart
on the left reports the distribution of human targets from complex
X-ray structures with multifamily ligands. For enzymes, the distribution
of catalytic functions is shown in the pie chart on the right.

2.3 Exemplary
Ligands and X-ray Structures
Figure 3 shows X-ray
structures of ligands in complex with targets from different families.
Comparison of X-ray structures of the same ligand in complex with
different targets frequently revealed differences in binding modes.
For instance, the phenothiazine derivative thioridazine shown in Figure 3a was found in five
X-ray complexes with four targets from four different families. As
an exemplary comparison, the binding mode of thioridazine observed
in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma translocation protein
1 (MALT1),19 a cysteine protease, clearly
differs from the one in aldehyde oxidase,20 an unrelated enzyme. While the tricyclic ring system of thioridazine
is located in a hydrophobic pocket of MALT1, it is partially solvent-exposed
in the X-ray complex with aldehyde oxidase. In addition, the positively
charged N-methylpiperidinyl moiety forms charge-assisted
hydrogen bonds with Glu397 of MALT1, whereas the tertiary amine of
the ligand forms backbone interactions with the carbonyl oxygen of
Arg1064 in the active site of aldehyde oxidase.

Figure 3 Multifamily ligands and
X-ray structures. In (a–c), exemplary
ligands and X-ray structures of their complexes with targets from
different families are shown. For each ligand, the total number of
complex X-ray structures, the number of PDB targets, and the number
of families from which these targets originated are reported. In the
X-ray structures, bound ligands are shown in stick representation
with standard atom coloring.

Figure 3b
shows
an example of an inverted ligand binding mode in two different active
sites. The flavonoid myricetin was found in seven complex structures
involving six targets from six different families. It displays opposite
head-to-tail orientations when bound to human pancreas amylase21 and the ATP-binding site of PIM1 kinase.22

Binding modes can also be compared for
multifamily ligands when
interactions with different targets lead to desired or undesired functional
effects. An example is shown in Figure 3c, where the thyroid hormone thyroxine (T4) is bound
to the IIa subdomain of human serum albumin23 or the ligand binding domain of thyroxine thyroid hormone receptor
beta (TR), its natural receptor.24 Binding
to serum albumin causes hyperthyroxinemia.23 Notably, T4 reaches deep into the TR binding pocket, where it interacts
with three arginine residues via charge-assisted hydrogen bonds. In
addition, the iodine atoms of T4 are accommodated in small subsites
mostly formed by the side chains of Phe459 and Phe455. By contrast,
T4 binds to human serum albumin in a surface-directed manner and predominantly
interacts with residues that are partially solvent-exposed.

2.4 Multifamily Ligands from Medicinal Chemistry
A subset
of 355 of the 702 multifamily ligands were detected in
the ChEMBL database,27 the major public
repository of compounds and activity data from the medicinal chemistry
literature. For these ligands, ChEMBL target annotations from high-confidence
direct binding/inhibition assays were collected. Taking these additional
annotations into account represented an expansion into medicinal chemistry
target space and increased the median value from three PDB (vide supra)
to 17 unique PDB/ChEMBL targets per multifamily ligand. Thus, crystallographic
multifamily ligands were generally promiscuous on the basis of medicinal
chemistry data. Although it cannot be excluded that some target annotations
from assays might be false positives, the availability of multiple
X-ray structures of these ligands in complex with different targets
lends credence to their promiscuous nature, strongly suggesting their
relevance for the study of multitarget activity and polypharmacology.

2.5 Analogues of Multifamily Ligands
For the
355 multifamily ligands available in ChEMBL, a systematic
search for analogue series (ASs) was carried out. For 243 of these
ligands, analogues were detected, yielding 168 unique ASs. Each AS
consisted of at least one X-ray ligand and varying numbers of noncrystallographic
analogues from ChEMBL. An exemplary AS is depicted in Figure 4. This AS contains an X-ray
ligand and several ChEMBL compounds with multitarget annotations,
providing corroborating evidence for the promiscuity of the multifamily
ligand from the PDB.

Figure 4 Analogue series. Shown is an exemplary AS including a
multifamily
ligand (blue core). For the crystallographic ligand, the number of
PDB targets, the number of targets reported in ChEMBL, and the number
of unique targets are given. For each ChEMBL analogue, the number
of targets from ChEMBL is provided. In each case, the corresponding
number of target families is given in parentheses. ChEMBL analogues
have no PDB target annotations. Substituents that distinguish analogues
are colored red.

2.6 Scaffolds
and Design Templates
From
ASs containing multifamily ligands, analogue series-based (ASB) scaffolds28,29 were derived. By design, ASB scaffolds take retrosynthetic criteria
into account and capture chemical information on compound series,
including the conserved substructure and substitution sites where
analogues are distinguished.28,29 For 133 of the 168
ASs with multifamily ligands ASB scaffolds could be derived. Exemplary
scaffolds are shown in Figure 5. Since ASs were associated with multiple targets, further
extending the set of PDB targets of multifamily ligands, the corresponding
ASB scaffolds also represent templates for the design of compounds
with different multitarget activities. On the basis of each scaffold,
different target combinations can be explored. The ASB scaffolds also
make it possible to differentiate between template structures with
different degrees of promiscuity. For example, scaffolds from highly
promiscuous analogue series, as shown in Figure 5, might be deprioritized as template structures
for the design of compounds with desired activity against a few targets,
even if these targets are contained in the scaffold-associated target
profiles. Instead, scaffolds from other less promiscuous series with
desired targets might be considered. Furthermore, for ASB scaffolds
with target combinations of interest, it is advisible to inspect the
target annotations of individual analogues to rationalize the series-based
target profile in more detail. Analogues can be easily obtained by
substructure searching using ASB scaffolds.

Figure 5 Exemplary scaffolds.
Shown are examples of ASB scaffolds representing
series of promiscuous structural analogues, including multifamily
ligands. For each scaffold, the total number of unique targets against
which the analogues were active and (in parentheses) the number of
corresponding target families are reported. Substitution sites in
ASB scaffolds are highlighted.

2.7 Conclusions
We have systematically
searched for crystallographic ligands bound to multiple targets from
different families. Such X-ray data were thought to provide firm evidence
for true multitarget activity of compounds. An unexpectedly large
number of qualifying ligands (702) were identified that covered targets
from a variety of families. Approximately half of these ligands originated
from the medicinal chemistry literature, which yielded additional
target annotations. Moreover, a total of 168 distinct series of analogues
that contained X-ray ligands were identified. From these, 133 analogue-series-based
scaffolds were extracted that captured chemical and target information
on individual series. Crystallographic multifamily ligands represent
a large, high-confidence knowledge base for multitarget activity.
Scaffolds derived from ASs containing such ligands can be considered
as templates for compound design. Therefore, multifamily ligands,
scaffolds, and associated target information are made freely available
as a part of this study. We also note that a variety of computational
methods are available to predict targets of test compounds. The uncertainties
associated with target predictions go much beyond experimental uncertainties
associated with compound data. However, searching for compounds with
true multitarget activities is difficult on the basis of experimental
activity data, taking assay-dependent activity readouts and potential
artifacts into account. For these reasons, X-ray structures of ligand–target
complexes provided the initial focal point of our analysis and were
complemented by taking medicinal chemistry data into account. By contrast,
possible computational predictions were deliberately avoided, given
the motivation and scope of our analysis.

3 Materials
and Methods
All calculations were carried out using in-house
Perl and Python
scripts with the aid of the OpenEye chemistry toolkit,30 KNIME protocols,31 and RStudio.32 X-ray structures were
graphically analyzed using the Molecular Operating Environment.33

3.1 Ligands from X-ray Structures
X-ray
structures and associated compound data were extracted from the Ligand
Expo section34 of the PDB.18 Salts and other buffer components were removed, and ligands
with a molecular weight of at least 300 Da yielding unique aromatic
nonstereo SMILES35 representations were
retained. Application of the molecular weight cutoff ensured that
small organic components and fragments were excluded from further
consideration. All of the selected complex X-ray structures were visually
inspected.

3.2 Compounds and Activity
Data
From
ChEMBL (release 23)27 a total of 853 533
unique compounds were extracted for which activity data from direct
binding/inhibition assays (target relationship type “D”)
were available.

3.3 Target Family Distribution
For crystallographic
targets of human origin, family assignments were obtained by combining
the classification schemes of UniProt36 and ChEMBL. In addition, known targets of all of the selected ChEMBL
compounds were determined on the basis of unique UniProt identifiers.

3.4 Analogue Series and Scaffolds
From
combined PDB and CHEMBL compounds, ASs were systematically extracted
using a recently developed algorithm37 utilizing
the matched molecular pair (MMP) formalism.38 An MMP is defined as a pair of compounds that are distinguished
only by a structural change at a single site,38 often termed a chemical transformation.39 To generate MMPs, compounds were systematically fragmented39 according to retrosynthetic rules,40 yielding RECAP-MMPs.41 From ASs, recently introduced ASB scaffolds28,29 were extracted, which capture the conserved substructure of a series
and all substitution sites.

3.5 Data Deposition
All of the multifamily
ligands have been made available, together with their crystallographic
targets, PDB identifiers, and total numbers of targets, including
annotations from ChEMBL (if available). In addition, all of the ASB
scaffolds derived from ASs containing multifamily ligands are provided.
The collection of ligands and scaffolds is freely available in a deposition
on the Zenodo open access platform.43
