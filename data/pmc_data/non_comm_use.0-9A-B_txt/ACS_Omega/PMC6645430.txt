Nanoporous
conformal coating is an important class of materials
for electrocatalysis, water purification, antireflective coatings,
etc. Common synthesis methods of porous films often require harsh
conditions (high temperature and high plasma power) or specific substrate
materials. Here, we report a plasma-enhanced sequential infiltration
synthesis (PE SIS) as a new platform toward deposition of nanoporous
inorganic films. PE SIS is based on oxygen-plasma-induced rapid conversion
of metal precursors selectively adsorbed in a block-copolymer template.
Porosity and thickness of resulting materials can be easily controlled
by characteristics of the template. PE SIS is conducted under gentle
conditions, and can be applied to a broad range of substrates,
including water-sensitive surfaces. PE SIS offers adventurous rapid
infiltration with improved ability to obtain highly interconnected
porous alumina films with thicknesses up to 5 μm. We show that
full infiltration of the polar domain of the polymer template can
be achieved upon initial exposure to TMA, followed by its oxygen-plasma-induced
conversion into a functional material. Since different types of plasma
(such as oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, etc.) induce conversion of a
broad range of metal precursors, PE SIS opens a new approach for synthesis
of highly porous materials with various elemental compositions and
stoichiometries.

Introduction
Water-based thermal
atomic layer deposition (ALD) on block-copolymer
(BCP) templates resulted in the discovery of vapor-phase self-limiting
sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS).1−3 SIS based on infiltration
of polymer templates with inorganic materials enabled fast growth
of nanoporous inorganic structures with finely tuned pitch, thickness,
porosity, and composition. The key process of state-of-the art classical
thermal ALD and SIS is a reaction of metal precursor chemisorbed inside
a polymer template with water vapors. Nanoscale patterning of
inorganic materials with tunable characteristic feature size has many
potential applications in electronics,4 biochemistry,5,6 optics,7−9 and photonics.10 Nanostructured materials with well-controlled
morphology over macroscopic length scales have recently enabled the
development of high surface area sensors for biomedical applications,11 hydrogen storage,12 and antireflection coatings for optical applications,13−15 as well as friction- and wear-reducing porous surfaces for orthopedic
implants16,17 and reservoirs for solid lubricants18−20 or water filtration.21 Porous materials
are an important class of nanostructured systems for electrochemical
energy storage applications.22

Coatings
with nanosized features or pores can be fabricated by
traditional lithographic approaches. However, the traditional approaches
are typically slow and expensive and patterning of features smaller
than 50 nm is rather challenging.23 The
recently developed SIS is a promising alternative approach for depositing
conformal nanostructured inorganic films. This method integrates the
ALD process that results in selective infiltration of inorganic precursor
in polar domains of the self-assembled block-copolymer templates that
reacts with water in the subsequent cycle in a self-limiting regime
and leads to the formation of an inorganic structure.24,25 In contrast to dense ALD coatings, SIS coatings are nanostructured
patterns replicated from the self-assembled block-copolymer templates.
The advantage of SIS over ALD is its ability to provide thicker coatings
within a few reaction steps.1,26 Thermal SIS has been
successfully used to improve the lithographic patterning,27 design of oil-adsorbing sponges,28 and single and multilayer antireflective coatings.29 Traditional SIS is based on the reaction between
a precursor chemisorbed inside a polymer template and water vapors.
However, elevated temperatures required for this reaction in the thermal
SIS are incompatible with moisture-sensitive and thermally unstable
surfaces or interfaces. Previously, plasma ALD demonstrated advantages
over thermal ALD, such as higher quality of the deposited materials,
lower impurity content, and better electronic properties; lower deposition
temperature; increased choice of precursors and materials; tuned stoichiometry
of the compositions as a result of deposition under nonequilibrium
conditions; and increased growth rate.30 Thus, plasma-enhanced sequential infiltration synthesis (PE SIS)
potentially allows the synthesis of a broader range of porous nanostructured
materials as compared to thermal SIS and is essential for our ability
to design functional materials with advanced properties.

Here,
we demonstrate that SIS can be realized via PE conversion
of a metal precursor. We show that the exposure of trimethylaluminum
(TMA) molecules to oxygen plasma leads to the synthesis of a conformal
alumina coating with controlled thickness and porosity. Moreover,
we show that the oxygen plasma step of the process facilitates production
of fully infiltrated nanoporous structures within one cycle, as compared
to a minimum of eight cycles required in water-based thermal SIS,29 hence minimizing the time of the synthesis of
highly porous structures. We demonstrate that up to 5 μm alumina
films can be achieved in one step. The alumina films obtained by PE
SIS are highly porous, as evidenced by the quenching of photoluminescence
(PL) from CsPbBr3, upon the exposure of such structures
to highly humid environment. In turn, the control sample with CsPbBr3 NPs protected by solid 10 nm alumina deposited by PE ALD
exhibited photoluminescence 2 orders of magnitude higher after a 5
days of storage in humid environment (40% relative humidity).

Results
and Discussion
Previous studies demonstrated that alumina
can be deposited by
thermal31 and PE ALD.32,33 Thus, we focused our study on synthesis of conformal alumina coatings
because it is the most understood system obtained by SIS. Our intent
was to explore PE ALD for SIS as an alternative to the thermal ALD
approach to produce nanostructured surfaces and coatings with controllable
thickness and porosity. PE ALD does not require elevated temperatures,
and because the conversion of chemisorbed precursors is achieved by
plasma, it suggests potential application to moisture-sensitive and
thermally unstable surfaces and interfaces.

First, we concentrated
on infiltration of the poly(styrene-block-4-vinylpyridine)
(PS-b-P4VP) (75k-b-25k) template
with TMA, followed by exposure to oxygen
plasma of different powers and duration. The BCP films of 50 nm were
spin-casted on the silicon substrate. After infiltration steps, the
residual polymer films were removed using high-temperature annealing29 resulted in the formation of porous alumina
coatings (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of porous structures
(∼50 nm thickness) obtained at different oxygen plasma power
exposure times of the nonswelled PS-b-P4VP (75k-b-25k) template infiltrated with TMA to plasma and oxygen
pressures. The structures were obtained by five SIS cycles processed
as follows: (a) at 3 Torr oxygen, 100 W plasma for 20 s of exposure;
(b) at 6 Torr oxygen, 100 W plasma for 60 s of exposure; (c) at 6
Torr oxygen, 200 W plasma for 20 s of exposure; (d) at 6 Torr oxygen,
200 W plasma for 60 s of exposure; (e) at 3 Torr oxygen, 300 W plasma
for 20 s of exposure; (f) at 6 Torr oxygen, 300 W plasma for 20 s
of exposure.

In the case of low power
and short exposure of the BCP template
to plasma, coatings with low fraction of alumina were obtained (Figure 1a). However, increases
of plasma power, exposure time, and pressure facilitated the synthesis
of conformal coatings with higher alumina content.

Worth mentioning
is that when selecting PE SIS conditions, plasma
energy should be high enough to produce the reaction of transformation
of all TMA molecules within the polymer template into aluminum oxide
species but low enough to avoid damage of the polymer template. The
ideal situation for SIS would be if plasma power allows for the growth
of the films with subsequent burning of the polymers after complete
transformation of the chemisorbed precursors. However, that can be
a challenge for BCP. Previous studies on ion etching of polymers revealed
that the polar part of the polymer molecule is more sensitive to plasma
exposure.34,35 Thus, a much higher removal rate was reported
for polar polymer (e.g., poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)), as compared
to almost negligible removal for nonpolar polymer (100% polystyrene
(PS)).34 The selective reactivity of TMA
precursor with C=O and C–O–R functional polar
groups of the polymer macromolecule requires minimizing/prevention
of polymer damage during plasma exposure while keeping the reactivity
of the plasma species high. Therefore, the plasma exposure time during
the SIS process is kept short to eliminate/minimize the damage of
the polar domains used for templated deposition of inorganic materials
in SIS and to prevent generation of stresses in the resulting films,
expected to lead to material cracking and detachment.

To understand
the effect of oxygen plasma on polar domains in BCP,
a Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) study was performed on BCP PS-b-P4VP (75k-b-25k) (Figure 2) before and after PE SIS. Specifically,
polymer samples subjected to plasma exposure, swelling, PE SIS, and
thermal SIS of various durations were analyzed with FTIR by monitoring
the changes in bond configuration of the treated polymer templates
as compared to that of the as-spin-coated film.

Figure 2 (a) No swelling FTIR

of the effect of thermal SIS and PE SIS when performed on 50 nm thick
PS-b-P4VP (75k-b-25k). All of the
spectra are referenced to initial as-spin-coated PS-b-P4VP. (b) Swelling FTIR absorbance measurements for swelling induced
modifications in the polymer during thermal SIS and PE SIS. Swelling
was performed in ethanol at 70 °C for 1 h.

First, plasma-induced modifications in the polymer films
were analyzed. Figure 2a demonstrates no
significant changes in the absorbance FTIR spectrum, and only a slight
decrease in C=O absorbance (at ∼1729 cm–1) and increase in O=C=O absorbance (at ∼2350
cm–1), when PS-b-P4VP is exposed
to one or two cycles of plasma. Thus, we can conclude that negligible
damage is produced by the plasma in the P4VP domains and that the
deposited structure under given plasma conditions can be determined
only by the characteristics of the PS-b-P4VP template.
Second, the alumina infiltration process resulted in a decrease in
the absorption for CH bending of CH3 and CH2 compounds at 1580, 1500, 1450, and 1410 cm–1.36 This suggests that in the case of P4VP polymer,
CHx are the major sites for alumina growth.

The same plasma conditions can be applied to other types of BCP,
in particular to PS-b-PMMA, the most common BCP in
SIS, because only minor polymer modifications, such as a slight decrease
in C=O absorbance of PMMA by plasma, were detected by FTIR.
Similar to thermal SIS,24 PE SIS on PMMA
was accompanied by certain modifications in polymer structures. More
specifically, stretching in carbonyl C=O (at ∼1729 cm–1), ester C–O–R (at ∼1145 and
∼1260 cm–1), and C–H (at ∼2950
cm–1), as well as bending of C–H (at ∼1450
cm–1)37,38 are observed. A more
pronounced decrease in absorbance peaks at 1729, 1145, and 1260 cm–1 in FTIR spectra acquired for five cycles of PE SIS
as compared to that in five cycles of thermal SIS is indicative of
more rapid consumption of carbonyl and ester groups than that for
thermal SIS and therefore more rapid infiltration of PMMA (Figure 3). This observation
is in good agreement with the previously observed faster kinetics
in PE ALD synthesis of solid conformal coatings of a broad range of
materials.32

Figure 3 FTIR delta absorbance
measurements for comparison of the effect
of water-based thermal SIS and PE SIS when infiltrating 50 nm thick
PMMA polymer. All of the spectra are referenced to initial as-spin-coated
PMMA.

The kinetics of infiltration of
BCP templates was studied using
grazing incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) analysis on
samples prepared with one, two, three, and five PE SIS cycles. The
two-dimensional GISAXS images for all of the samples are almost identical,
one of which is shown in Figure 4a. One-dimensional linecut profiles from the images
(Figure 4b) also revealed
that the structures of all four samples show the same form factor
oscillation, meaning that the diameters of pores or posts are identical.
A minor difference in GISAXS patterns revealed a slightly better resolved
structure factor peak at around qy ∼0.02
Å–1, as the number of SIS increases (Supporting Information). This suggests more extended
inorganic features in the samples with more cycles and can be interpreted
by the fact that the infiltration process is fast and likely performed
stochastically. One cycle leads to full infiltration of the polar
polymer molecule part, with additional cycles resulting in growth
of materials on top with regular ∼1Å thickness/cycle rate.
These results are consistent with reported earlier higher rates of
the material’s growth in the case of the PE ALD in comparison
with the thermal ALD.39 Our SAXS results
suggest a similar trend for PE SIS as well. Thus, the advantage of
PE SIS in terms of eliminating multiple steps of the deposition procedure
is demonstrated.

Figure 4 GISAXS analysis of the nonswelled PS-b-P4VP (75k-b-25k) polymer infiltrated with different
numbers of PE
SIS cycles (300 W, 20 s of oxygen plasma). GISAXS image of one PE
SIS sample (a) and horizontal linecuts (b) of one through five SIS
samples are presented. Linecuts are made at qz ∼0.035 Å–1 in (a) and scaled
arbitrarily for clarity. No noticeable difference in the resulting
films deposited with one, two, three, and five PE SIS cycles is observed.
SEM images of the films grown with (c) one cycle and with (d) five
cycles are included as well. Porosity of the samples is in the 70–80%
range.

In the case of water-based thermal
SIS, we already demonstrated
that porosity of the resulting alumina films is highly dependent on
the characteristics of the polymer template.29 Specifically, the concentration of polar/nonpolar domains in the
polymer is one of the major factors determining the resulting porosity
of the synthesized aluminum oxide films. The same trend in the effect
of polymer composition on the porosity is observed for the PE SIS
process (Figure 5).
The higher length of the polar part results in a less porous material
(Figure 5c). However,
as in the case of thermal SIS, control over film thickness was limited
by the penetration depth of the TMA. The thickness of the alumina
films was in the range of 50–60 nm and did not depend on the
thickness of the BCP template. In our previous study,29 we demonstrated that the swelling of BCP could be used
efficiently to control the thickness and porosity of the deposited
films. This was achieved by immersing the PS-b-P4VP
template into ethanol,40 which is selective
to the P4VP block, and drying afterwards. The generated additional
porosity throughout the film in the positions where the P4VP block
was swelled and subsequently collapsed allowed more efficient infiltration
of a thick film.

Figure 5 SEM images of porous alumina films grown by the PE SIS
infiltration
(five SIS cycles) of PS-b-P4VP polymers (50 nm thick
polymers swelled in ethanol at 70 °C for 1 h) with different
volume fraction of polystyrene: (a) 75k-b-25k, (b)
25k-b-25.5k, and (c) 24k-b-51k.
The thickness of the resulting alumina films is in the range of 80–100
nm with porosity varying from 30% for 24k-b-51k PS-b-P4VP (∼68:32 concentration of polar/nonpolar domains)
polymer to 50 and 70% for 25k-b-25.5k (∼50:50
concentration of polar/nonpolar domains) and 75k-b-25k (25:75 concentration of polar/nonpolar domains) polymers correspondingly.

Here, we also implemented the
swelling procedure to initiate additional
porous channels for TMA infiltration. For this purpose, we spin-coated
a thick PS-b-P4VP film (∼5 μm thickness)
on the silicon substrate. The major limiting factors for developing
such thick films are uniformity of the spin-coated polymer and adhesion
to the substrate when performing swelling. Figure 6 summarizes the results for the films grown
before and after polymer removal. Swelling produced an 11 μm
thick polymer film that converted into a ∼5 μm thick
nanoporous alumina structure. We believe that the limitations in thickness
are due mostly to the penetration depth for the vapor and mechanical
compression of the films after polymer removal.

Figure 6 Thick nanoporous films

(a) Before complete polymer removal, the
film demonstrates a charging effect and thickness of ∼11.1
± 1.8 μm. (b) After complete removal of the polymer by
burning, the porous structure is observed and the resulting thickness
of the film is ∼5.6 ± 0.4 μm.

FTIR measurements on swelled PS-b-P4VP block-copolymer
templates after alumina infiltration as compared to those on the original
polymer film indicated similar trends in BCP subjected to thermal
and PE SIS (Figure 2b). However, when compared with nonswelled polymers, changes are
significant. Specifically, CH bending of CH3 and CH2 at 1580, 1500, 1450, and 1410 cm–136 became the dominant mechanism of the alumina
growth. Negative features for CH stretching in normalized FTIR spectra
of nonswelled samples suggested the consumption of these groups during
SIS. With introduced swelling, they become positive, confirming the
increased presence of these groups during swelling. PE SIS partially
suppresses their intensity, whereas the very little effect of water
SIS indicates slower infiltration process.

To obtain information
about the interconnectivity of the pores
in alumina deposited by PE SIS, we conducted the following experiment.
We deposited 10 nm alumina on the spin-coated layer of perovskite
CsPbBr3 NPs (∼50 nm film) on a silicon substrate.
CsPbBr3 NPs are very promising materials for photovoltaic
devices with excellent optoelectronic properties; however, their extremely
high moisture sensitivity seriously limits their practical application
(Figure 7). Exposure
to water results in the immediate degradation of CsPbBr3 NPs accompanied by complete quenching of PL. The CsPbBr3 NP layer with 10 nm thick alumina film obtained with 100 cycles
of PE revealed 2 orders higher PL as compared to that of an unprotected
layer of CsPbBr3 NPs after 5 day exposure to humid air
(40% humidity). The spin-casted layers of CsPbBr3 NPs subjected
to water process-based thermal ALD indicated almost complete degradation
of perovskite material. In Figure 7d, the wavelength shift for the samples covered with
alumina is observed. This is most likely due to a higher dielectric
constant of the medium introduced by the ALD process.41

indicate higher photoluminescence response for nanoparticles protected
with 100 PE ALD.

Conclusions
We
have developed a new synthetic approach for selective sequential
infiltration synthesis of nanoporous films using a sequence of exposure
of the polymer to TMA vapor and to oxygen plasma. PE SIS offers adventurous
rapid infiltration with improved ability to obtain thick films. We
show that full infiltration of the polar domain of the BCP template
can be achieved within the first cycle, whereas thermal SIS required
eight cycles. PE SIS demonstrated high depth of polymer infiltration,
with up to 5 μm thick films being obtained when infiltration
of the PS-b-P4VP BCP template (75k-b-25k) was performed after its swelling. Among the methods used for
synthesis of porous alumina, PE SIS can be realized at much more gentle
conditions (e.g., low temperature and power) and can be potentially
applied to the broad range of substrates.

We demonstrated that
the solid alumina film protects against water-induced
degradation of perovskite NPs. Meanwhile, PE SIS films grown on top
of perovskite NPs resulted in immediate degradation of their optical
properties upon the water exposure, which indicates high interconnectivity
of the porous alumina structure. Such high interconnectivity of nanoporous
structures formed by PE SIS can be potentially used for design of
highly efficient filtration materials.

In summary, we report
on synthesis of highly porous films using
the PE ALD process. As compared with thermal ALD, advantages of PE
ALD that include higher quality materials, faster deposition rate,
deposition of nonstoichiometric materials, and reduced forms of materials
and metals lead to our conclusion that PE SIS will improve our ability
to synthetize highly porous nanostructured materials for a broad range
of applications ranging from catalysis and electrocatalysis to optical
coatings.

Experimental Methods
Sample Preparation
Block copolymers
(BCP) such as poly(styrene-block-4-vinylpyridine)
(PS-b-P4VP) with
different lengths of polar and nonpolar blocks (PS75k-b-P4VP25k, PS25k-b-P4VP25.5k, PS24k-b-P4VP51k) were purchased from Polymer Source, Inc. BCP films of
different thicknesses were prepared by spin-coating from 3 and 6 wt
% toluene solutions onto clean silicon substrates with native silicon
dioxide films. Cleaning of the substrates was performed as follows:
20 min of sonication in acetone, followed by 20 min of sonication
in isopropanol, followed by 30 min of UV ozone exposure. After spin-casting
of BCP, the samples were kept on a hot plate at 180 °C for 10
min to evaporate residual toluene and to induce microphase separation.
Thicknesses of resulting polymer films varied from 100 ± 10 to
5000 ± 40 nm for 3 and 6 wt % toluene solutions, respectively.
PS25k-b-P4VP25.5k and PS24k-b-P4VP51k polymers were dissolved
in dimethylformamide, which is a better solvent for higher concentration
of vinylpyridine. Regular poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) 950 polymer
of 2% concentration was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

Synthesis
of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals followed literature procedures.42 Lead bromide (>98%), cesium carbonate (99.9%),
octadecene (90%), oleylamine (70%), and oleic acid (90%) were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. For synthesis, 69 mg of lead bromide, 0.5 mL of
dry oleylamine, 0.5 mL of dry oleic acid, and 5 mL of octadecene were
held under vacuum at 120 °C for 1 h, then heated under nitrogen
atmosphere to 170 °C. At 170 °C, 0.4 mL of 0.125 M cesium-oleate
solution (407 mg of cesium carbonate, 20 mL of octadecene, and 1.25
mL of oleic acid) held at 120 °C was rapidly injected. The reaction
proceeded for 5 s, then was quenched with a water bath. Nanocrystals
were purified by centrifugation of the reaction mixture, dispersed
in toluene and precipitated with acetonitrile, and re-dissolved in
toluene for spin-coating. The sample was characterized by transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) using a JEOL-2100F TEM.

The sequential
infiltration synthesis reactant, such as trimethylaluminum
(Al(CH3)3, TMA 96%), was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as received. The high-purity research grade oxygen gas was
purchased from Praxair Inc.

Polymer Swelling
Swelling of the
polymer films to increase
SIS infiltration depth and provide uniformity of the resulting nanoporous
films was achieved by immersing the whole sample into pure ethanol
and keeping it at 70 °C for 1 h. The samples were then dried
under nitrogen gas flow.

Sequential Infiltration Synthesis
PE SIS was performed
using the remote plasma atomic layer deposition (ALD) system, RMPA-4000L.
The Al2O3 coatings were produced by infiltrating
the polymer films using binary reactions of TMA/oxygen plasma. The
exposure of BCP films to TMA vapor results in selective binding to
polar groups in microphase-separated polymer domains. Selectively
bound Al–(CH3)2 converts into Al2O3 in the subsequent SIS half-cycle of exposure
to oxygen plasma. The PE SIS was performed at 90 °C (below the
polymer glass transition temperatures) to avoid the flow of swelling-formed,
predefined polymer structures. Silicon or glass substrates with polymer
films were loaded onto a stainless-steel tray and kept in 200 sccm
argon flow for at least 30 min prior to deposition. One cycle of PE
SIS was performed as follows: 3 Torr of the synthesis reactant precursor,
TMA, was admitted into the reactor using argon carrier gas (20 sccm)
for 400 s. Thereafter, the excess of the reactant was evacuated and
was followed by admitting 6 Torr of oxygen gas and igniting oxygen
plasma with 300 W power for 20 s; the chamber was then purged with
200 sccm of argon to remove noninfiltrated byproducts. The cycle was
repeated several times to determine the degree of infiltration.

Thermal Annealing of the Polymers
Following SIS, the
polymer component of the resulting film was removed by baking the
samples in a Thermo Fisher Scientific tube furnace at 450 °C
for 2 h while flowing oxygen gas at 50 sccm. Upon cooling, removal
of carbon was confirmed with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
analysis of the film.

Deposition of Al2O3 on Perovskite Nanoparticles
Compatibility of the procedure
with water-sensitive materials was
evaluated by growing aluminum oxide films on cesium lead bromide nanoparticles
that were synthesized using a previously described procedure.42 Thin films of cesium lead bromide were produced
by spin-coating CLB-containing toluene solution on silicon wafers.
After drying in a nitrogen atmosphere, the films were exposed directly
to ALD procedures with the polymer deposition step omitted. One hundred
cycles of PE ALD and thermal ALD procedures were used to coat the
perovskite samples with a thin aluminum oxide film.

Characterization
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
images with energy dispersive spectra analysis were collected with
the FEI NOVA 200 system. Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and grazing
incidence small angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data were collected
at Beamline 12-ID-B at the Advanced Photon Source. The X-ray beam
(14 keV) was exposed to thin-film samples in both transmission and
grazing incidence reflection modes for SAXS and GISAXS measurements,
respectively. The scattering data were collected with a Pilatus 2M
detector located about 2 m away from the samples. Changes in the polymer
macromolecules during PE SIS were evaluated using a Nicolet 6700 Fourier
Transformation Infrared spectrometer (FTIR) with 600–4000 cm–1 spectral range. Thickness of the films and porosity
were measured by the J.A. Woolam M-2000V Automated Angle Ellipsometer.
Photoluminescence data were collected in reflection geometry using
a 405 nm PicoQuant laser diode excitation source with emission fiber-coupled
to a silicon CCD. TEM was performed using a JEOL-2100F microscope.
