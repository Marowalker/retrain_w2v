Cancer is one of
the most deadly diseases worldwide. Although several
chemotherapeutic agents are available at present for its treatment,
they have their own limitations. The main problems of these chemotherapeutic
agents are cost involvement and severe life-threatening antagonistic
effects. Here, we report a new biodegradable N-rich porous organic
polymer methylenedianiline-triformyl phloroglucinol (MDTFP-1) synthesized
via a Schiff base condensation reaction between two reactive monomers,
that is, 4,4′-methylenedianiline and 2,4,6-triformyl phloroglucinol
under inert atmosphere. Because this porous polymer contains polyphenolic
building units and has a high Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
surface area (283 m2 g–1), it has been
explored in the anticancer activity using HCT 116, A549, and MIA PaCa-2
cell lines. We have carried out the flow cytometric assessment using
Annexin-V-FITC/PI staining through the exposed level of phosphatidylserine
in the outer membrane of cells with MDTFP-1-induced apoptosis. Our
results suggested that apoptosis of cells have been enhanced in a
time-dependent manner in the presence of this novel porous polymer.

Introduction
Over the past few decades, cancer has
emerged as the major cause
of mortality throughout the globe.1 According
to a recent statistics on cancer, 14 million newly diagnosed cases
in each year with 8 million mortality and over 32 million people are
suffering and undergoing treatment.2 Lung
cancer in male and breast cancer in female population are the leading
causes of cancer-related mortality. This exponential rise of cancer
is evident owing to the change in human lifestyle, environmental variation,
and sun irradiation.3 The multifactorial
environment, genetic basis, and diversity in pathogenesis of different
neoplastic etiologies are an obstacle to finding a definitive cure
for cancer. The conventional chemotherapeutic agents show a considerable
pause in tumor growth and its metastasis, but the serious life-threatening
adverse effect (hepatic and renal parenchymal disease and bone narrow
aplasia) through destruction of normal cellular homeostasis has been
motivating the researchers to find out an alternative way of treatment,
which will not only overcome the treatment-related obstacles but also
improve the quality of life. Nanomaterials with anticancer activity
are intensively studied in the recent times as nanoparticles having
a size of less than 100 nm can easily penetrate through the cell and
can selectively target the cancer cells without affecting other parts
of the body.4,5 Porous nanomaterials bearing reactive
organic moiety in their framework are particularly interesting as
they can act as a carrier for drug delivery or itself as an anticancer
drug.6 Apoptosis is an efficient programmed
regulation of cellular homeostasis defined by cell biology.7 Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as a crucial
factor by working as a messenger in a cellular-signaling system to
alarm apoptosis.8 The equilibrium of ROS
and the antioxidant is a prime factor, and any alteration of these
two causes various cellular harms, leading to inflammatory diseases
and carcinogenesis.9 Thus, induction of
apoptosis in cancer cells through the introduction of body-friendly
materials can surely open a window from a nanotechnological viewpoint.
This aforesaid principle motivated us to explore the anticancer activity
of a novel porous nanomaterial bearing reactive organic groups (e.g.,
polyphenolic compounds) at its surface.

Porous organic polymers
(POPs) with tunable nanoarchitecture and
functionality can be designed by using a wide range of reactive monomers.
A high specific surface area and ease of accommodating reactive functional
groups are the most exciting features of these POPs, and these are
particularly helpful in exploring their potentials in energy, environmental,
and biomedical research.10 Thus, porous
polymers have been utilized in heterogeneous catalysis,11 gas storage,12 energy
storage,13,14 sensing,15 white
light emmision,16 and electrocatalysis.17 Nanocargos for cancer therapy18 and imaging19 are very demanding
for the future application of nanomaterials in biomedical research.
POPs are largely synthesized through radical polymerization,20 condensation,21 cyclization,22 metal-mediated coupling,23 and solvothermal24 condensation
reactions. Their huge scope through simple condensation reactions,
cost-effectiveness, and abundance of C–N bonds in the organic
network has motivated the researchers to develop a wide range of POPs.
In contrast to metal organic frameworks, zeolites, and metal oxides,
the C–N-based organic materials are more environmentally safe
and biocompatible. Moreover, the nanoscale porosity, flexible synthesis
strategy, diversity in the framework building units as well as the
framework stability have made them a promising candidate for biomedical
applications.25

Although for catalysis,
drug delivery, and biomolecule-sensing
applications, the porous nanomaterials such as functionalized mesoporous
materials,26,27 covalent organic framework,28 and graphene-based composites29 have been utilized, the anticancer activity of the porous
polymers bearing organic functionalities is largely unexplored till
date. It is noteworthy to mention that curcumin bearing multiple phenolic-OH
groups with extended π-conjugation has displayed a remarkable
anticancer activity for pancreatic cancer.30 Herein, we first report the synthesis of a new POP methylenedianiline-triformyl
phloroglucinol (MDTFP-1) via a Schiff base condensation reaction between
4,4′-methylenedianiline and 2,4,6-triformyl phloroglucinol.
The material has been thoroughly characterized by powder X-ray diffraction
(XRD), N2 sorption analysis, Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state 13C CP MAS NMR, field-emission
electron microscopy (FE-SEM), high-resolution transmission electron
microscopy (HR-TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and CHN analysis,
and its anticancer activity has been explored using various human
cell lines.

Results and Discussion
Nanostructure and Porosity Measurement
The wide-angle
powder XRD of the MDTFP-1 material is shown in Figure 1. Here, three broad peaks at a 2θ value
of 12.3°, 26.6°, and 43° with low intensities were
observed. Thus, these powder XRD data suggested the semicrystalline
nature of the polymeric framework. Meanwhile, to determine the porosity
of the material in detail, nitrogen adsorption/desorption analysis
was performed. The N2 adsorption/desorption isotherm is
shown in Figure 2,
where features of both type I and type IV with a small H3 hysteresis
loop are observed. In the low pressure region (0.01–0.25 P/P0), the sharp increase of
the adsorption isotherm indicated the presence of microporosity throughout
the whole polymer matrix. At a high partial pressure range (P/P0 = 0.65–0.99), further
increase in N2 uptake suggested the existence of interparticle
mesoporosity in the material.31 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area and the pore volume of the material were 283 m2 g–1 and 0.1633 cm3 g–1, respectively. The pore size distribution plot has been evaluated
by the nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method, where the
sharp peak appeared at 1.3 nm, and this is shown in the inset of Figure 2. The De Boer statistical
thickness (t-plot) analysis revealed the microporosity
and mesoporosity contributions to the total surface area, and these
are 240 and 43 m2 g–1, respectively.

where filled circles represent the adsorption points and empty circles
indicate the desorption points. The pore size distribution plot is
shown in the inset of the figure.

Spectroscopic Analysis
FTIR spectra of MDTFP-1 and
monomers 4,4′-methylenedianiline and triformyl phloroglucinol
are shown in Figure 3. One broad and another weak adsorption band were observed at 3425
and 1510 cm–1, respectively. These could be attributed
to the −N–H stretching and bending vibrations. The characteristic
peak appeared at 1621 cm–1 is attributed to the
α,β-unsaturated ketone of the enol tautomer in the polymer
moiety. Also, the absence of imine (C=N) and hydroxyl (−OH)
stretching bands in Figure 3a can confirm that the material framework does not contain
any enolic form.32 The sharp signal appeared
at 1576 cm–1 suggested the existence of C=Cstretching
frequency in the enol to keto tautomerization process. Further, a
signal at 1455 cm–1 was observed for the −C–H
bending vibration, and the strong signal appeared in the vibrational
region of 1250–1288 cm–1 could be attributed
to the formation of the −C–N bond in the polymer matrix.
From Figure 3b, the
well-defined sharp peaks were noticed at 3420 and 3336 cm–1 for the stretching vibration of primary amine groups. For the −N–H
in-plane bending vibration, the strong signal was observed at 1614
cm–1. Figure 3c represents the IR spectrum of triformyl phloroglucinol,
where the peak was noticed at 1646 cm–1 for the
carbonyl (C=O) stretching vibration of the aldehyde (CH=O)
part in the 1,3,5-triformyl phloroglucinol (TFP) compound.

and triformyl phloroglucinol (c).

The solid-state 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum has been
recorded
to investigate the chemical environment of the MDTFP-1 polymer. Figure 4 represents the solid-state 13C CP MAS NMR spectrum, where the resonance signals are observed
at 183, 174, 146, 138, 128, 118, 109, and 100 ppm because of the polymeric
framework containing various types of carbon atoms. The strong signal
appeared at 183 ppm for the carbonyl carbon atom and along with this,
another low intensity peak at 174 ppm was originated because of aromatic
ring carbon adjacent to the −N–H groups.32 Also, the absence of a distinctive peak at 191
ppm confirms all the aldehyde groups of the triformyl phloroglucinol
moiety participated in the Schiff base condensation reaction.33 The resonance signal noticed at 146 ppm was
attributed to the formation of enamine carbon. The remaining abovementioned
signals, that is, 138, 128, 118, 109, and 100 ppm, are observed for
aromatic carbon centers. The characteristic peak at 109 ppm revealed
the existence of sp2 carbons of the phloroglucinol moiety.
The sharp peak appeared at 37 ppm could be assigned because of the
−CH2 group present in the polymer framework.

atoms are shown in the inset.

Electron Microscopic Analysis
To get an idea about
the morphology of the porous polymer, FE-SEM analysis has been carried
out. The FE-SEM images of the MDTFP-1 material are shown in Figure 5a,b, where the small
rodlike particle morphology with diameter in the range of 30–50
nm was observed. On the other hand, HR-TEM analysis has been carried
out to understand the nanostructure of the porous polymer. Figure 6a,b represents the
HR-TEM images of the MDTFP-1 material. As noticed from Figure 6a, the pores having a diameter
of ca. 1.2 nm are spread throughout the whole specimen, and this confirmed
the microporous nature of the material.

Thermal Stability and CHN Analysis
To understand the
thermal stability of the MDTFP-1 material, TGA has been performed
in the temperature region of 25–800 °C. The first weight
loss in the temperature range of 205–315 °C was observed
due to the decomposition of organic functional groups, and the second
weight loss was observed in the temperature region of 370–600
°C for burning the residual part of the polymer matrix. Figure 7a,b represents the
TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) profile diagrams of the
material, respectively, which suggested that the polymer has considerably
good thermal stability. This is essential for carrying out the biomedical
application under solvent media. Further, we have carried out CHN
elemental analysis of MDTFP-1. The CHN analysis revealed the carbon,
hydrogen, and nitrogen contents in the polymer framework as C = 47.23%,
H = 5.26%, and N = 8.62% (experimental), respectively. Theoretically,
the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents in the proposed polymeric
framework (Scheme 1) are calculated to be C = 46.15%, H = 5.31%, and N = 8.27%, respectively.
Good resemblance of the theoretical and experimental composition data
suggested nice fitting of the proposed model framework of MDTFP-1.

Anticancer Activity
Our study revealed that MDTFP-1
exhibited appreciable cytotoxicity toward a panel of three cancer
cell lines (HCT 116, MIA PaCa-2, and A549 cell line) as per the data
of MTT assay. Treatment with different concentrations of MDTFP-1 (0–10
μg/mL) for 24 h amplified the cell death significantly (Figure 8), and the IC50 value (5.69 ± 1.02 μg/mL) is lowered toward HCT
116 compared to the other two cell lines. In the case of IC50 of the chemotherapeutic drug, 5-fluorouracil is 10.24 ± 2.14
μg/mL. Therefore, the concentration of 6 μg/mL was selected
for the other experimentation by using HCT 116 cells.

doses (0–10 μg/mL) of MDTFP-1
on different cancer cell lines in 24 h.

Apoptosis is generated by elevated ROS, and thus, we have
checked
the ROS generation (Figure 9). The mean fluorescence intensity of dihydrodichlorofluorescein
(DCF) was significantly (p < 0.05) increased in
a time-dependent manner upon MDTFP-1 treatment. We have carried out
the experiments multiple times, and the relative DCF fluorescence
intensity plots are displayed in a time-dependent manner. To discover
whether MDTFP-1 was involved in apoptosis/necrosis, we have carried
out the flow cytometric assessment using Annexin-V-FITC/propidium
iodide (PI) staining by studying the exposed level of phosphatidylserine
in the outer membrane of cells. Our result showed that the % of apoptotic
(early and late) cells has been enhanced by a time-dependent manner
(6.63% EA/21.5% LA for 6 h, 5.69% EA/26.3% LA for 12 h, and 3.05%
EA/19.7% in LA for 24 h) with respect to the control cells (3.08%
EA and 9.34% LA) (Figure 10).34 These results suggested that
the MDTFP-1-induced cell death was related to cytotoxicity followed
by apoptosis. We have checked this porous polymer MDTFP-1 in the normal
cell line HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cells), where we observed
that the IC50 value is 20 μg/mL, and this is three
times more than HCT 116. This result suggested that our MDTFP-1 is
highly potential for cancer treatment without affecting the normal
tissues.

Conclusions
Our
experimental results suggested that a nitrogen-rich POP bearing
multiple phenolic-OH groups can be synthesized through the Schiff
base condensation reaction between 4,4′-methylenedianiline
and 2,4,6-triformyl phloroglucinol. The material exhibits a good BET
surface area and abundance of phenolic-OH groups at its surface, which
motivated us to explore its potential in cancer treatment. Our cell-culture
experiment suggested that MDTFP-1 is induced by programmed cell death,
apoptosis, and externalization of phosphatidylserine, followed by
ROS generation. Thus, the POP MDTFP-1 has potential to be utilized
as an anticancer agent to overwhelm the epidemiology of cancer in
the future.

Experimental Section
Materials
Phloroglucinol (M = 126.11
g/mol), 4,4′-methylenedianiline (M = 198.27
g/mol), and hexamine (M = 140.18 g/mol) were obtained
from Sigma-Adrich, India. Trifluoroacetic acid (99.5%) was purchased
from Alfa Aesar. Anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF) was obtained from Spectrochem, India, and was used without further
purification. All other organic substrates and hydrochloric acid (analytical
grade) were procured from E-Merck, India.

Characterization Techniques
To record the nitrogen
adsorption/desorption isotherms of the POPs, Quantachrome Autosorb
1-C was used, and the samples were activated for 12 h at 120 °C
temperature under high vacuum conditions to get rid of any surface-adsorbed
moisture or solvent. The BET surface area and NLDFT pore size distribution
of MDTFP-1 were estimated by employing N2 at a 77 K carbon-slit
pore model of Autosorb-1 software from the N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherm. The powder XRD patterns of the solid sample were recorded
on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE SWAX diffractometer, which was operated at
40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The instrument has been calibrated
with a standard silicon sample by Ni-filtered Cu Kα (λ
= 0.15406 nm) radiation. The solid-state 13C CP MAS NMR
spectrum of the polymer was obtained on a Bruker ADVANCE 500 MHz NMR
spectrometer using a 4 nm MAS probe with a spinning rate of 5000 Hz,
with sideband suppression. To record the FT-IR spectrum of the samples,
a PerkinElmer Spectrum 100 was used. The UV–visible diffuse
reflectance spectrum of the sample was recorded in a UV 2401PC instrument
with an integrating sphere attachment, where BaSO4 was
used as a background standard. The HR-TEM images of MDTFP-1 were recorded
using a JEOL 2010 TEM instrument operated at 200 kV. The sample for
TEM analysis was prepared by dropping a sonicated ethanolic suspension
of the sample onto the carbon-coated copper grid. To understand the
morphology as well as the particle size of the sample, FE-SEM analysis
was carried out in a JEOL JEM 6700 electron microscope. TGA/DTA of
MDTFP-1 was performed at a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min in a
TGA instrument thermal analyzer TA-SDT Q-600 under air flow. A PerkinElmer
2400 Series II CHN analyzer was used for the elemental analysis of
the porous polymer MDTFP-1.

Method for the Synthesis of the Porous Polymer
(MDTFP-1)
TFP was synthesized using phloroglucinol and hexamine
by the Duff
formylation reaction method.35 At first,
in a 250 mL round-bottom flask containing hexamethylenetetramine (7.4
g, 52.5 mmol), oven-dried phloroglucinol (3 g, 23.8 mmol) and trifluoroacetic
acid (45 mL) were added, and the solution mixture was allowed to stir
in a preheated oil bath at 100 °C temperature for about 2 h under
nitrogen atmosphere. Then, the reaction mixture was subjected to vigorous
stirring for 1 h after slow addition of (150 mL) 3 M hydrochloric
acid onto it. After completion of the reaction, the resultant solution
mixture was filtered through the cold celite bed, and the filtrate
was extracted with dichloromethane and sodium sulfate, where the latter
was used as the dehydrating agent. The fluffy off-white-colored solid
product was collected after solvent evaporation and characterized
through 1H and 13C NMR (electrospray ionization).

The porous polymer MDTFP-1 has been synthesized through the Schiff
base condensation reaction between the diamine and trialdehyde monomers.
In typical synthesis, 2 mmol TFP (420 mg) and 3 mmol 4,4′-methylenedianiline
(594 mg) were taken in a 100 mL dry two-neck round-bottom flask containing
20 mL anhydrous DMF. Then, the solution mixture was allowed to reflux
for 36 h under inert atmosphere. After completion of the reaction,
the brick-red-colored solid product was formed, and it was collected
through simple filtration, followed by repeated washing with DMF,
absolute ethanol, and acetone step by step to get rid of any unreacted
starting compounds. The solid product was dried in air overnight,
and it was allowed for Soxhlet extraction using methanol to get a
pure solid product. The observed product yield was 88%, and this porous
polymer MDTFP-1 was characterized thoroughly.

Cell Lines and Chemicals
Human colorectal carcinoma
(HCT 116), human small lung carcinoma (A549), and human pancreatic
carcinoma (MIA PaCa-2) cell lines were purchased from the National
Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India. Cell culture media, viz., Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin–streptomycin–neomycin
antibiotic cocktail, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and trypsin
were procured from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA). Additional raw and
fine chemicals were procured from Sisco Research Laboratories, India,
and Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology,
USA.

Cell Culture
Briefly, human colorectal carcinoma (HCT
116), human small lung carcinoma (A549), and human pancreatic carcinoma
(MIA PaCa-2) cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified condition
under constant 5% CO2 in DMEM containing 10% FBS with 1%
antibiotic cocktail. After 75–80% confluency, cells were seeded
with trypsin (0.25%) and EDTA (0.52 mM) in phosphate buffered saline
(PBS) and plated at a necessary density to allow them to re-equilibrate
before the experimentation.

Cell Viability
For determining the
cell viability,
MTT [(4,5-dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide]
assay was performed to initially check the cytotoxic effects of MDTFP-1.36 A required number of cells (4 × 103 cells/well) were seeded in a 96 well-plate and treated with
MDTFP-1 at different concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 μg/mL).
After treatment, plates were reserved for 24 h at 37 °C in a
humidified CO2-rich condition (5%). After 24 h of the incubation
period, cells were thoroughly washed with PBS, and then, MTT solution
(4 mg/mL) was added and kept it in an incubator for 4 h. The absorbance
of the DMSO-solubilized intracellular formazan salt was recorded at
595 nm using an ELISA reader (EMax, Molecular Device, USA). In all
the cases, the MDTFP-1 samples were sonicated before treating in a
cell line to get homogenized mixtures. The final reported biological
data were represented after repeating the experiments in triplicate.

Assessment of Apoptosis and Necrosis Using Flow Cytometry
The assessment of apoptosis and necrosis was analyzed by flow cytometry
using an Annexin-V FITC/PI apoptosis/necrosis detection kit (Calbiochem,
CA, USA).37 The treated cells (1 ×
106) were washed and stained with Annexin-V-FITC and PI
in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. The percentages
of viable, apoptotic (early and late) along with necrotic cells were
quantified by flow cytometry (BD LSRFortessa, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped
with FlowJo software.

Assessment of Intracellular ROS
It has been already
reported that mitochondrial ROS is one of the key signaling molecules
for apoptosis.38 Therefore, for that, we
have quantified the ROS level. To determine the intercellular ROS,
we incubated the treated cells with 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein
diacetate of 10 μM at 37 °C for 25 min before the analysis
by the flow cytometer (BD LSRFortessa, San Jose, CA, USA) equipped
with FlowJo software. The increment of DCF fluorescence is the symbol
of generated ROS inside cells, which was signified as mean fluorescence
intensity of DCF.

Statistical Analysis
The results
are expressed as mean
± SEM. Statistical significance was determined by comparing between
various treatment groups and controls using the one-way analysis of
variance. Data were considered statistically significant when p values were <0.05.
