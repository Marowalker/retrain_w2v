Optically assisted electrical generation of umbilic defects,
arising
in homeotropically aligned nematic liquid crystal cells and known
as topological templates for the generation of optical vortices, are
reported in nematic liquid crystals with positive dielectric anisotropy
in detail. It is shown that nematic liquid crystals with positive
dielectric anisotropy can serve as a stable and efficient medium for
the optical vortex generation from both linearly and circularly polarized
input Gaussian beams. Hybrid cells made from a thin layer of nematic
liquid crystal confined between a photoresponsive slab of iron-doped
lithium niobate and a glass plate coated with an active material,
i.e., indium tin oxide, were studied. Exposure to a laser beam locally
induces a photovoltaic field in the iron-doped lithium niobate substrate,
which can penetrate into the liquid crystal film and induce realignment
of molecules. The photovoltaic field drives charge carrier accumulation
at the interface of indium tin oxide with the liquid crystal, which
effectively modifies the shape and symmetry of the electric field.
The photovoltaic field has a continuous radial distribution in the
transverse xy-plane, weakening with increasing distance
from the light irradiation center, where the electric field is normal
to the cell plane. Umbilics are created as a result of the liquid
crystal tendency to realign parallel to the electric field. Numerical
studies of the transmitted intensity profiles in between linear polarizers
reveal optical vortex pattern (of four and eight brushes) characteristics
for the umbilical defects. The application of crossed circular polarizers
results in annular-shaped intensity patterns as a result of spin-to-orbital
angular momentum conversions, which give rise to the optical vortices.

1 Introduction
Dynamical rotation of
the electromagnetic field of light with respect
to the axis of propagation is described by a vector quantity called
angular momentum associated as spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital
angular momentum (OAM). While SAM is attributed to the light beam
polarization as elliptical or circular, OAM is corresponding with
the twisting of the beam wave front around the propagation axis (coincident
with a topological phase singularity); such a beam is called an optical
vortex (OV).1−6 The intensity profiles of OVs were made from donut-shaped concentric
rings with zero-intensity at the center1−6 associated with the beam phase singularity. At a given wavelength
λ, the phase front of an OV beam is composed of |l| intertwined helices along the propagation axis, where the integer
azimuthal index l gives the amount of OAM carried
by the wave per photon as lℏ.6,7

OVs are structurally stable in a homogeneous and isotropic
medium
due to invariant OAM.8 In nonlinear media
(characterized with third-order nonlinear optical susceptibility χ(3)
> 0), the lensing property imposes vortex solitons generation as
self-trapped
spatially localized beams keeping structural shape during propagation.9,10 During the past decades, OVs have found tremendous applications
in different fields such as coronagraphy in astronomy,11,12 cryptography based on OAM states of photons in telecommunication
systems,13−15 micromanipulation techniques in biological systems,16−18 and as depletion beams in stimulated-emission-depletion (STED) microscopy.19

Different methods were developed for generating
OVs, such as employing
a pair of cylindrical lenses,20 spiral
phase plates,21−23 segmented deformable mirrors,24 computer-generated holograms (CGHs) in the form of spatial
light modulators (SLMs),25 forked diffraction
gratings,25−27 or spiral Fresnel lenses.28 Nematic liquid crystals (LCs), as outstanding candidates, have found
applications in the electro-optical systems aimed at spin–orbit
manipulation of light29−31 because of their self-organization properties, ease
of controlling their optical axis, exhibiting a long-range orientational
order, and exhibiting high optical anisotropy and birefringence as
well.

OVs can be generated in the nematic liquid crystals by
means of
different mechanisms such as q-plates,32 nematic droplets,33 and umbilical defects
(in short “umbilics”).34,35 The topological
structures of umbilics were described by Rapini in 1973,36 resembling string-like objects in three dimensions
(3D).35,36 In the LC, umbilics act as topological matter
templates, which are able to convert an incoming circularly polarized
light beam into a helical (vortex) light beam, the so-called photonic
spin-to-orbital momentum couplers.37 Umbilics
have been extensively studied in the nematic LCs with negative dielectric
anisotropy (Δε < 0), where the LCs tend to realign
perpendicular to the applied electric field. Here, it is shown how
successfully the nematic LCs with positive dielectric anisotropy (Δε
> 0), as initially aligned homeotropically, can be employed for
the
purpose of umbilics generation as well confined and without any disclination
line. In our recent experimental study,38 it was shown that the planar anchoring condition on the cell walls
can lead to the formation of disclination lines in the LC cells with
a similar structure to the one studied here.

Hybridized LC cells
made from a thin film of LC confined between
an indium tin oxide (ITO)-coated glass slab and a z-cut ferroelectric-substrate-iron-doped
lithium niobate (Fe/LiNbO3 or in short Fe/LN) were studied
(Figure 1). Treating
the cell confining walls (both ITO-coated glass and the interface
of Fe/LN with the LC) can provide a homeotropic anchoring condition
for the LC, corresponding with an unperturbed condition. In the recent
experimental work of Kravets and co-workers,39 it was shown that the photoassisted dc electric field can induce
spin–orbit optical vortex generation with high purity and efficiency
(>90%). Here, light induced photovoltaic (PV) field in the Fe/LN
has
a distribution in the LC media. Although it is strong enough to induce
the LC reorientation,38,40−42 photoinduced
charge carriers in the single active ITO layer reshape the electric
field profile in a promising way for optical vortex generation. In
the work reported by Barboza et al.,43 a
liquid crystal light valve (LCLV) was made by employing Bi12SiO20 (BSO) slab as a photosensible wall, which acts as
an optical tunable impedance, if illuminated properly, by means of
tuning the effective voltage in the LC media.

hybridized LC test cell with a laser beam
with sub milliwatt power.

The umbilics in the nematic LC with positive dielectric
anisotropy
(Δε > 0) are created as the result of the competition
between the elastic torque and electric torque applied by the optically
assisted PV field. Previously, they were studied both experimentally
and theoretically in a situation where the external applied torque
on the LC was of the purely optical nature.44,45

For comparison, umbilics generated in the LCs with negative
dielectric
anisotropy, referred to as model umbilics, were studied. The simulation
results showed that the topological defects generated in the nematic
liquid crystal with positive dielectric anisotropy possess all of
the fundamental features of the model umbilics.

2 Discussion
2.1 Simulation of Photogenerated Electric Field
in the Hybridized LC Cell
Studies were conducted for the
nematic LC of MLC-208738,40 with the positive dielectric
anisotropy of Δε = 13.31 at zero frequency associated
with the dc electric field, a birefringence of Δn = 0.076, and an average elastic constant of K =
14.7 pN. To obtain a visualization of the photovoltaic field distribution
in the LC, simulation was conducted in a test cell filled with an
isotropic medium with a dielectric constant of εiso = 10.16 (equal to the average dielectric constant of MLC-2087),
as shown in Figure 2. LC realignments were studied by taking into account the anisotropy
of media as discussed in Section 4. The simulation geometry can be also seen in Figure 2. As previously described,40 light irradiation of the LC test cell with Fe/LN
substrates gives rise to a photoinduced charge carriers separation
that can be described by a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution (σ
= σ0e–(x2+y2)/w2) of positive charge carriers at the top surface of
the Fe/LN substrate and a similar distribution of negative charge
carriers at the base. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) w of the Gaussian charge carriers distributions was set
equal to the FWHM (14 μm) of the exposure beam focus. The thickness
of the Fe/LN substrate was set to 100 μm and its dielectric
constant was considered anisotropic (ε∥z = 29 and ε⊥z = 85).
The simulation geometry had a footprint of x × y = 60 × 60 μm2 in the transverse xy-plane.

Figure 2 Schematic of photogenerated electric field distribution
in a hybridized
LC test cell with Fe/LN substrate and ITO-coated glass plate. The
electric field generated within the Fe/LN substrate induced a charge
carrier accumulation in the active ITO layer. As a result, modeling
was done by placing Gaussian charge carrier distributions in the upper
and lower plane (xy-plane) of the Fe/LN substrates,
as well as in the LC/ITO interface. The E-field is
shown in the rear half of the volume to give a clear view of the center
area in magnification.

The test cell was set up from an ITO-coated cover
glass with a
relative permittivity of about εSITO = 946−48 in the static
electric field. The thickness of the ITO layer deposited at the glass
surface was much smaller than both the LC layer and the Fe/LN substrate;
it was supposed in the range of 100–300 nm in the simulations:
A Gaussian charge distribution, with negative sign and the same FWHM
as the ones attributed to the Fe/LN crystal, was supposed at the boundary
of the ITO with the LC, as a result of charge accumulation induced
via photovoltaic field within the ITO layer (the reasons are explained
in more detail in Section 4 as well as in the Supporting Information). In modeling, the photovoltaic field was considered as the only
source of the static electric field in the cell. The electric field
exhibits distribution inside the glass plate because of the limited
permittivity and negligible thickness of the ITO film. The charge
density amplitudes σ0 of the Gaussian charge carrier
distributions, and thus the magnitude of the static electric fields
inside the LC layer, were increased stepwise in the simulations.

The field distribution obtained in this model is seen in Figure 2. It shows that the
local electric field is normal to the sample plane (parallel to the z-direction) at the exposure spot center. One can thus expect
that the initial homeotropic alignment of the LC (in the LC with positive
dielectric anisotropy) is maintained here locally, which—for
transmitted polarized light—presents a virtual continuous phase
singularity: this region appears as a dark spot in the intensity distribution
of transmitted light. Moreover, fringe fields were seen around the
exposure spot center (the center of the Gaussian charge carrier distribution)
and the electric field decays in radial direction. As can be seen
in Figure 2, the electric
field distribution has a continuous radial distribution in the transverse xy-plane. Such a field distribution can be expected to induce
a radial distribution of the LC director in the cell corresponding
to the director realignment in a splay umbilic. If so, the polarization
of the light incident in the area surrounding the local phase singularity
can be modulated, since the optical axis is no longer oriented parallel
to the propagation direction. In the umbilics with transverse distribution
of the local optical axis, this leads to the creation of optical vortices.35,49

2.2 Modeling of Director Field in a Splay Umbilic
Observed in the Nematic LC with Negative Anisotropy (Model Umbilic)
Umbilics appear in the LC cell at voltages higher than threshold U > Ut (Ut = π(K3/ε0|Δε|)1/2),35,36 where K3 is the bend elastic constant
and Δε
= ε∥Ω – ε⊥Ω is the dielectric anisotropy at a frequency
Ω defined as the difference between permittivity along and across
the director direction, i.e., ε∥Ω and ε⊥Ω, respectively. Continuity
in the structure is in fact the main difference between an umbilical
and a frank defect.36 Structure of an umbilic
is specified by a continuous core a(r) called reduced amplitude, which is numerically obtained from36 1  where a∞ is the reduced amplitude at infinity approaching the value of one35 and the parameter χ is inversely proportional
to the core radius rc, defined as36 2  where d is LC film thickness, K is the effective elastic constant determined from the
nature of the defect (for example, K = K1 for splay umbilics), and Ũ = U/Ut is called the reduced voltage.
The local orientation of a nematic liquid crystal is represented by
a dimensionless director field n, where n and −n are physically equivalent
due to the lack of polarity of molecules. Director field n (described as n = (nx, ny, nz)) can be introduced
based on the projections in the transverse xy-plane
(i.e., n⊥) and along the z-axis (i.e., nz), respectively, as n = (n⊥, nz).
The director field in transverse plane n⊥ reads n⊥ = |n⊥|C(φ), where |n⊥| is amplitude and C is a unit
vector giving local direction in the transverse xy-plane as a function of angle φ (φ = sϕ + φ0, where s gives the topological strength of defect, ϕ is the azimuthal
angle, and φ0 is a constant value equal
to zero for the case of splay umbilic, as shown in Figure 3a). In the splay umbilic, C(φ) gives a radial distribution in the transverse xy-plane (Figure 3). According to Rapini,36n⊥ can be obtained from 3  where a(r) (0 ≤ a(r) ≤ 1)
has the minimum value of zero at the center of defect. By considering n as an unit vector field, nz can be obtained from the tilt angle θ with
respect to the z-direction (k-vector
supposed parallel to the z-direction), as nz = cos(θ). θ can
be calculated from36 4  where θ∞ is the value
of θ at large r, defined as36 5  where the parameters K1 and K3 are elastic constants
corresponding with splay and bend configurations, respectively.

reduced amplitude a at a relative voltage of U/Ut = 1.12. Projection of the
model director field in the xy-plane (n⊥): (c) side-on view, (d) top view. The parameter d corresponds to the cell gap.

The director field of the model umbilic in the
LC with negative
dielectric anisotropy (based on the model described in the literature35) projected in the xy-plane
and demonstrated in three dimensions (3D) is shown in Figures 3 and 4, respectively. The LC cell is addressed with a homogenous electric
field. The simulations were done for the nematic LC of MLC-207935 with the negative dielectric anisotropy of Δε
= −6.1 at Ω = 1 kHz, a birefringence of Δn = 0.15 at 589 nm wavelength, and the elastic constants
of K1 = 15.9 pN and K3 = 18.3 pN. At the center of the model umbilic, n⊥ has the minimum value of zero (Figure 4): because of no
preferential orientation in this spot, the LC keeps its homeotropic
alignment along the film associated to a topological phase singularity.
The magnitude of n⊥ increases in
the radial direction and reaches its maximum value far from the center
of the film35 under the dominance of the
reduced amplitude a. The distribution of the local
optical axis is comparable to an optical q-plate
with radial geometry50 suitable for vortex
generation. Such a director pattern can generate optical vortices
in a thin sample or if the LC has a low birefringence, since diffraction
effects (which are unwanted in a q-plate) are then
negligible for light propagating perpendicular to the sample plane.50,51

3 Results
3.1 Formation of a Splay Umbilic in the Nematic
LC with Positive Anisotropy
In the second step, the field-induced
LC realignment was simulated in the MLC-2087 filled sample with Fe/LN
substrate by using a Q-tensor approach by fully considering
the anisotropic dielectric constant of the LC (MLC-2087) with ε∥0 = 16.81
and ε⊥0 = 3.50 at zero frequency and using the one-constant approximation
(this approach was described earlier40 in
detail). For the simulation of the electric field,38 the following modification was necessary: charge accumulation
is considered in the ITO layer induced by the photovoltaic voltage
(discussed in the Supporting Information). In addition, the anchoring conditions were defined based on the
test cells condition: at both the ITO and Fe/LN surfaces (covering
the LC), homeotropic anchoring was considered.

The LC director
field as n = (nx, ny, nz) was obtained from numerically
calculating Q-tensor40,52−57 6  where S and δij are the scalar order parameter and Kronecker’s
delta function, respectively. Energy of the LC volume in static can
be described in terms of the Q-tensor elements and
their spatial derivatives, i.e., Qij and ∇Qij. According to Landau–de Gennes expansion, in the absence
of any external electrical or optical stimuli, the energy density
of the LC can be considered as a summation of Landau–de Gennes
potential and elastic energy, i.e., ELdGP(Qij) and ELdGe(∇Qij), repectively40,54 7  where 8   9  here A, B, and C are material constants (where A is temperature dependent) and L/2 is the effective
elastic constant K. In the LC volume, the photovoltaic
field induced dipole moments on the LC molecules: since the LC had
a positive dielectric anisotropy, the director field was locally rotated
toward the field polarization direction, which leads to elastic torques
in the LC. Anisotropic dielectric properties of the LC were considered
by the permittivity tensor40,54 10  where ε̅ = 1/3(ε∥0 + 2ε⊥0) and, as
mentioned before, Δε = (ε∥0 – ε⊥0), with ε∥0 and ε∥0 being the
permittivity along and across the director direction at dc PV field,
respectively. In addition, the electric energy density stored in the
system was40,54 11  where the electric displacement field was
obtained from Di = ε0εijEj (Ej = ∂jU),
where ε0 is the vacuum permittivity. EE could be retrieved in terms of the electric potential U and Q-tensor elements as40,52−55 12  The total free energy in the whole volume
of the LC V was calculated from40,54 13  By minimizing the total free energy, the Euler–Lagrange
equation40 was obtained, which gave director
field distributions in the static condition 14  where the effective elastic constant K = L/2 was employed in the one elastic
constant approximation. In this approach, the distribution of Q was numerically calculated using finite elements (COMSOL
Multiphysics). The data obtained were postprocessed in Matlab in a
mesh of x × y × z = 124 × 124 × 124 data points.

The boundary
conditions for the LC director field alignment at
the confining surfaces of ITO and Fe/LN were supposed homeotropic
with infinite anchoring energy. Qb at
these boundaries was locally set as 15  where ex, ey, and ez are unit vectors of the Cartesian
coordinate system (x,y,z).58

The distribution of the photovoltaic field (static electric
field)
is shown in Figure 5. As seen in this figure, the magnitude of the static electric field
was higher in the upper region of the sample (near the ITO-coated
glass plate, section I) than in the lower part of the sample (near
Fe/LN interface, section II) and had a minimum value at the vicinity
of the (virtual) surface S (Figure 5) at the center of the LC layer.

Figure 5 (a) Electric
field distribution (photovoltaic field) in the xz-plane of the simulated test cell in the thin ITO layer.
(b) The LC-filled area is shown selectively. This area is divided
into two sections (section I near the ITO surface, section II near
the field generating Fe/LN slab), which are separated by a virtual
surface S. A possible tendency to locally realign
the director from the initial homeotropic alignment A to an reoriented
state B is indicated for each section.

At photovoltaic voltage (U >
0), ITO acts as an
active n-type semiconductor in contact with the LC as an insulator
media. The structure of the cell is comparable with a metal–insulator–semiconductor
(MIS)59 structure. As a result, it can
be expected that the charge accumulation happens at the boundary of
ITO with the LC. In detail, the mechanism can be explained as near
the ITO/LC interface, the ITO conduction band (Ec) bends downward toward the Fermi level (Ef) as it was kept flat. Since the carrier density in the
semiconductor is proportional to exp(−(Ec – Ef)/kBT) (where kB is Boltzmann constant and T is temperature), this
reduction drives electron accumulation59 near the ITO/LC interface. According to the literature,60 the induced charge density can reach an order
of magnitude larger than the bulk-free carrier density of the ITO,
if biased properly. Since this mechanism can strongly affect the real
and imaginary parts of the refractive index of ITO (exploited with
a thickness in the range of some tens to hundreds nanometer), it has
found applications in the phase and absorption modulation of surface
plasmon polariton (SPP) in the visible60 and infrared48 (specifically in telecommunication61,62) wavelength ranges, respectively. Here, charge accumulation in the
ITO layer desirably affects the structure of the electric field in
the LC cell, making it suitable for umbilics formation.

Charge
carrier density supposed in accumulation at the ITO/LC interface
results in the convergence of electric field in the LC media with
rotational symmetry, which in fact provides the vital condition for
the generation of the fringe director field (shown in Figure 4) corresponding with the umbilical
realignments. Since ITO had a relatively small relative permittivity
in the static electric field,46−48 the tangent element of the electric
field at the boundary of the ITO with LC is seen (Figure 5a). However, as expected, the
electric field strength decreased in the ITO thin film as it goes
to zero, far away from the charge carrier accumulation62 in the glass (Figures 2 and 5).

In
the laser on state, when the induced voltage exceeds the threshold,
the director field is locally realigned from the initial homeotropic
alignment (A) to a realigned state (B) parallel (or antiparallel)
to the electric field vector in section I and II. Since the LC molecules
have no polarity, they are tilted by the electric field in a way to
minimize the energy, which means that they always prefer to rotate
with the smaller possible angle to go from an initial to a final alignment.
For example, in the left region (Figure 5, at x < 0) of the LC-filled
area, the electric field tends to realign the LC molecules clockwise
(section I, x < 0) and counterclockwise in section
II. The static condition is maintained, because at every point, the
electric torque exerted on the LC molecules is compensated by the
net elastic torque exerted by the neighboring molecules. As a result,
the director field was continuously realigned in the cell, giving
rise to the umbilical configuration corresponding with minimum total
free energy per unit volume of the LC.

The electric field distribution
had rotational symmetry in the xy-plane and it was
therefore able to induce a continuous
radial (Figure 6c)
realignment of the LC director in this plane. In the area surrounding
the exposure spot center, where the photovoltaic field is vertical,
the radial alignment was supported by the elastic interactions in
the LC imposed by the neighboring molecules’ realignment in
the radial direction. As seen in Figure 6, the simulated director field has rotational
symmetry, as expected. The alignment in the xz-plane
(Figure 6b) showed
all of the characteristics of a splay umbilic35,36 configuration: as in the model umbilic (Figures 3 and 4), homeotropic
alignment was preserved at the defect center (x =
0). Moreover, the director field had splay deformations, which is
seen in Figure 6a,b
(in the xz-plane). The radial distribution of the
LC director is best seen in a top view (Figure 6c). In addition to giving the LC director
distribution, the simulation was also capable of explaining the generation
of optical vortices in the samples (as discussed in the following
section).

3.2 Simulation of Output Intensity Patterns
The intensity distributions of the optical transmissions in between
linear and circular polarizers were calculated. The local effective
refractive index for probe light passing (propagating in the z-direction) through the LC was obtained from37,49,63,64 16  where θ(x,y,z) is the tilt angle of the director with respect
to the z-direction, no and ne are ordinary and extraordinary
refractive indices equal to 1.48 and 1.55 for MLC-2087 (simulations,
positive dielectric anisotropy) at a wavelength of λ = 589 nm,
respectively.

The total optical phase difference Γ(x,y) between ordinarily and extraordinarily polarized light
was obtained for each point in the xy-plane by calculating
the optical phase change accumulated by transmission through the LC
layer35,37,49,64 as 17  where d is the cell gap (30
μm). Optical phase changes Γ were numerically obtained
and compared to the corresponding results for umbilic defects (referred
to as model umbilics) generated in the LC (MLC-207935) with negative dielectric anisotropy reported by Brasselet
(in ref (35)) in the
conventional LC cells35,36 under static electric fields
(at the reduced voltages Ũ = U/Ut equal to 1.1235 and 1.25,35 respectively). Numerical
studies were done by the assumption of the same LC film thickness
of 30 μm and irradiation by a laser beam with the same λ
= 589 nm wavelength. Both models revealed continuous Gaussian-like
phase change profiles37 for both types
of LCs, where Γ always has the minimum value of zero at the
center of defects (Figure 7), driven by the homeotropic alignment, as it provides an
isotropic spot for the light propagation in the LC. Although the size
of the defect core in the model umbilic is a function of applied voltage
(as by increasing the voltage, it decreases significantly),35 the core radius of the umbilic generated in
the LC with positive anisotropy depends only on the FWHM of the incident
laser spot.

LC with positive anisotropy corresponding with the induced charge
densities equal to σ0 = 40 μC m–2 and σ0 = 60 μC m–2 in the
early stage of OVs formation, respectively.

The polarization modulation properties of the director
patterns
were studied by Jones calculus. The local Jones matrices M(x,y)50 were obtained by considering the Jones matrix for an oriented (azimuth
angle φ(x,y)) wave plate inducing
an optical phase change Γ(x,y), where in general Γ was free to take arbitrary and locally
varying values 18  The Jones electric field vector notation for x-polarized input light is , which describes a linearly polarized plane
wave, polarized in the x-direction (Ein(x) = E0e–i(ωt – k0z)x), with angular frequency
ω and wave vector k0. The Jones
vector of the transmitted light can be obtained from Eout(x,y) = MEin(x) 19  The algebraic relations cos(2φ) = 1/2
(ei2sϕ + e–i2sϕ) and  can be applied to recast eq 19, where, in the case of splay umbilic, s = 135,36 20  where  is the Jones matrix for
circular polarizations (− for the right handed circular polarized
light, + for left handed circular polarized light). This calculation
showed34,35,65 that x-polarized input light was partially converted into two
contra-circularly polarized helical fields (optical vortices) with
the phase factor of ei2sϕ and e–i2sϕ through an equal conversion
factor of |1/2 sin(Γ/2)|2.3535 The phase fronts in each optical vortex
had a topological charge of |l| = 2s = 2 corresponding with |l|ℏ orbital angular
momentum (OAM) per photon,6 which was also
suggested for the optical vortex generation in the nematic LC with
negative dielectric anisotropy in the literautre.34,35,37,65 In the spin–orbit
space S ⊗ L2 with
quantum orbital number |l| = 2, the circular polarized
vortex photons can be expressed as |−1⟩S ⊗ |+2⟩L2 and |+1⟩S ⊗
|−2⟩L2, respectively,
where |−1⟩S and |+1⟩S stand for the right (spin down)- and left
(spin up)-circular polarization basis and |+2⟩L2 and |−2⟩L2 for the orbital angular momentum basis with the
quantum orbital number ±2, respectively. As a result, the output
beam can be characterized as an entangled state of the two vortex
photons as (|−1⟩S ⊗
|+2⟩L2 + |+ 1⟩S ⊗|−2⟩L2)/2,34 which appeared
as annular-shaped beams if no analyzer was used and as optical brushes
if a linear polarizer was employed as the analyzer.34,65 For the case of circularly polarized input light, a similar analytical
approach can be employed:35,37,49−51 The input circularly polarized beam (|∓1⟩S) can be converted to a single vortex beam
with opposite helicity (|±1⟩S ⊗ |∓2⟩L2).34

A quick check in the amount
of momentum carried by the photons
shows that if the input beam was linearly polarized, the output total
angular momentum per photon is expectedly zero because of the axisymmetry
of the system (“q = 1” case). For the
case of circularly polarized input beam, the conversion of the spin
angular momentum (SAM) to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) happened
while the net exchanged momentum is zero.49,51 Therefore, when a photon passes through such a q-plate, regardless
of the polarization, total angular momentum is conserved, which indicates
zero torque on the matter defect and maintenance of the defect stabilization.

The output intensity patterns in between crossed and parallel polarizers
(referred to as π⊥ and π∥, respectively) were obtained from eq 19 as 21   22  where I0 corresponds
to the input intensity. Considering energy conservation, the relation Ioutπ⊥ + Ioutπ∥ = 1 was always maintained, as expected. The
output intensity distributions numerically calculated for the umbilic
defect (Figure 6) are
shown in Figure 8.
Patterns of four and eight brushes were seen in between linear polarizers
at σ0 = 50 and 76 μC m–2,
respectively. The intensity distributions calculated for crossed linear
polarizers are shown in Figure 8a for σ0 = 50 μC m–2 and in Figure 8b
for σ0 = 76 μC m–2, respectively.
The corresponding patterns obtained for parallel linear polarizers
are shown in Figure 8c,d. The patterns of OVs were well defined and clearly distinguishable,
which are frequently seen35,65 and reported for umbilics:35 the first and second quadruple of OVs (numbered
relative to the center of defect) are made from four identical elongated
and flattened patterns, respectively, as seen in Figure 8a,c and Figure 8b,d, respectively.

Figure 8 Simulated output intensities
(at λ = 589 nm) in between (a,
b) cross- and (c, d) parallel linear polarizers for the umbilics generated
in the LC (MLC-2087) at (a, c) σ0 = 50 μC m–2 and (b, d) σ0 = 76 μC m–2, respectively.

The annular-shaped intensity distributions for
the umbilic director
reorientations were obtained for completeness: in between crossed
circular polarizers, the output intensity was calculated by35 23  where σ⊥ indicates
crossed circular polarizers. The calculated output patterns are shown
(Figure 9). Here, the
LC film acts as a spin–orbit coupler (q-plate), which creates
a phase singularity along the propagation axis of incident nonsingular
light beams, which appeared as a central dark spot. As seen in Figures 8 and 9, the output intensity patterns exhibited a residual hexagonal
symmetry because of the numerical calculations in the Cartesian coordinate
system, and this issue can be simply avoided by simulating the LC
cell in a cylindrical coordinate system.

Figure 9 Transmitted intensity
profiles (at λ = 589 nm) in between
crossed circular polarizers simulated for the umbilics induced in
the LC (MLC-2087) corresponding with (a) σ0 = 50
μC m–2 and (b) σ0 = 76 μC
m–2, respectively.

In the recent work by Calisto and co-workers,66 the theoretical studies indicate the possibility
of generation
of optical vortices in a LC media with positive elastic anisotropy
(δ > 0), defined as δ = (K1 – K2)/(K1 + K2). In another work,67 it was shown that in the liquid crystal light
valves (LCLVs), competition between the forcing of the external electric
field induced by the inhomogeneous light profile and the elastic anisotropy
can result in the swirling of the vortex arms. Here, although the
numerical modeling was made with the assumption of one elastic constant
approximation, the model can well describe the structure of umbilics. Since the induced electric field
is of the order of 10 kV/m, which prevails phase jump angle in the
core of the vortex as the observed structure with no bending and quite
stretched in the radial direction in the core region, and characterized
straight lines in between linear polarizers are expected (Figure 8).

4 Conclusions
Optically assisted electrical
formations of the umbilical defects
in the LC with positive dielectric anisotropy are reported. The generation
of umbilics was observed in the hybridized LC cells made from a plan-parallel z-cut Fe/LN substrate and an ITO-coated covering glass.
The photovoltaic field, induced in the Fe/LN substrate upon light
irradiation, has distribution in the LC-filled region as suitable
for the formation of the umbilical defects. The intensity profiles
in the nematic LC with positive dielectric anisotropy were obtained
from simulations based on the Q-tensor method. The
local exposure to a tightly focused Gaussian laser beam can lead to
the generation of umbilics with four- and eight-brush textures (depending
on the induced charge densities in the Fe/LN) in between linear polarizers.
Investigating the output intensity profiles suggests that the shape
of brushes well resembles the shape of brushes seen in a splay umbilic.
Annular-shaped intensity profiles were obtained by investigating the
light transmission in between crossed circular polarizers, typically
characterizing the output intensity patterns of OVs.

Simulations
revealed that the proper electric field (photovoltaic
field) distribution in the LC film was responsible for the creation
of umbilics. Comparisons of the director field profiles (in three
dimensions (3D) and in the transverse plane), as well as the phase
change profiles with the corresponding profiles associated with the
model umbilics (observed in the nematic LC with negative anisotropy),
assure the accuracy of the prediction.

The generation of OVs
induced by the umbilics was first discovered
from the discussed theoretical studies and simulations. The theory
predictions were checked experimentally for a test cell (with the
same geometry as discussed) filled with the nematic LC of MLC-2087,
and the formation of umbilics inducing OVs were verified.

This
finding can lead to new efficient techniques based on the
OVs generation in the self-engineered and controllable LC cells with
tremendous applications. Thanks to the locally confined topological
defects, generation of an array of OVs from a single LC cell is promising.
Since the size of the defect core is determined from the full width
at half maximum (FWHM) of the laser beam, it enables the generation
of OVs with desired structures.
