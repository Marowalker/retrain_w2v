The
first stage of the action mechanism of small cationic peptides
with antimicrobial activity is ruled by electrostatic interactions
between the peptide and the pathogen cell membrane. Thus, an increase
in its activity could be expected with an increase in the positive
charge on the peptide. By contrast, the opposite behavior has been
observed when the charge increases to reach a critical value, beyond
which the activity falls. This work studies the perturbation effects
in a cell membrane model for two small cationic peptides with similar
length and morphology but with different cationic charges. The synthesis
and antibacterial activity of the two peptides used in this study
are described. The thermodynamic study associated with the insertion
of these peptides into the membrane and the perturbing effects on
the bilayer structure provide valuable insights into the molecular
action mechanism associated with the charge of these small cationic
peptides.

==== Body
Introduction
Over many years, antibiotics have proved
essential for the therapeutical
treatments of different pathogen infections. However, the increase
in microbial resistance to antibiotics due to their excessive use
during recent decades means that new therapeutical strategies are
necessary. In this context, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a public health warning
in 2014, which states that this is not a problem that humanity will
have to face in the future but is something that is happening today
in the treatment of certain infections resistant to conventional antibiotics.
In this context, the increasing incidence of microbial infections
resistant to antibiotics is one of the greatest challenges that modern
medicine faces today.1

In this regard,
a great number of cationic peptides that are the
first natural barrier against external pathogens have been discovered
and characterized. These cationic peptides can be found in mammals,
insects, plants, and the skins of some amphibians.1−10 The two main characteristics of these cationic peptides are that
they have positive charges, ranging from +2 to +9, and that they fold
in an amphipathic helical conformation, with two well-defined hydrophilic
and hydrophobic faces.1,11,12 Although the alpha conformation is the most common,13 it has been reported that cationic peptides with β-sheet
conformation can also show antibacterial activity.5,11,14

The main limitation for developing
these cationic peptides as the
therapeutic agent is the lack of detailed knowledge about their action
mechanism at the molecular level.15 To
help remedy to this situation, our research group has contributed
to this topic with two publications. The first one provided insights
at the molecular level into the different mechanical properties of
binary lipid bilayers of dipalmitoyl phosphatidyl choline (DPPC)/dipalmitoyl
phosphatidyl serine (DPPS) in the absence and presence of salt,16 and the second one suggested an action mechanism
for small cationic peptides with antimicrobial and antifungal activity
based on a study of the mechanical and thermodynamic properties of
binary lipid bilayers of DPPC + DPPS.17

In line with the action mechanism of these antimicrobial peptides,18 there is a wide consensus that these peptides
focus their target on the destabilization of the cell membrane of
Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and fungus.1,7,11,14,19,20 Thus, these
peptides exert their lytic activity against pathogens by electrostatic
interactions with the negative charge of the microbial cell surfaces
(favored by the positive charge of these cationic peptides) and subsequent
pathogen membrane disruption.5,7,11,21 Hence, the positive charge of
the cationic peptide seems to be a crucial aspect that needs to be
considered in the discrimination process between the pathogen and
host cells.

In this context, the positive charge of these peptides,
together
with the amphipathic nature of their alpha helical conformation, seems
to be key aspects for their antimicrobial activity.12,20 However, as reported elsewhere,14 the
number of positive charges of these peptides is a critical parameter
in their antimicrobial activity. Generally, an increase in the positive
charge enhances the antimicrobial activity of these cationic peptides,
although for a number of positive charges above +9 the antimicrobial
activity almost disappears.1,22

Hence, the development
of novel therapeutic agents that could overcome
the resistance to standard antibiotics seems to be crucial for continuing
the fight against disease. Among novel treatments, small cationic
peptides have shown a great potential as a new generation of antibiotics.1,23 Increased knowledge of the nature and action mechanism of natural
cationic peptides has enabled new synthetic peptides to be produced
and tested in clinical trials.24,25 These synthetic peptides
(with antimicrobial activity) have shown activity when they were used
in animals as models of infections by a variety of pathogens.12,23,26 However, despite the great expectations
in this field, clinical trials have been limited, and none has been
approved for use in humans to date. Instead, trials have been limited
to topical applications26 because peptides
that apparently have negligible lethality and toxicity for mammalian
cells in vitro have frequently been found to be toxic when they were
injected into the bloodstream.25 Another
important aspect related to this delay in the use of such peptides
in clinical trials is their high cost of manufacture and, hence, of
prescription drugs.27 To overcome all the
inconveniences associated with the use of these cationic peptides
as new antibiotics, new short-chain peptides, which have less than
12 residues and are cheaper to manufacture, have been synthesized
as candidates for use in clinical trials. Our research group has previously
reported new small peptides (sequences possessing 11 and 12 amino
acids) with significant antibacterial activity.28 More recently, we reported on a peptide with nine amino
acids (Arg-Gln-Ile-Arg-Arg-Ile-Ile-Gln-Arg-NH2) that had
a strong antibacterial effect against a panel of pathogenic bacteria;29 in fact, this compound is the smallest peptide
with the strongest antibacterial activity reported to date.

The molecular dynamics (MD) simulation technique has been accepted
as a valuable complementary tool in experimental studies to understand
complex systems. In this work, we focus on studying the effect of
these cationic peptides on the structure of a cell membrane model
to predict their antimicrobial activity. With this goal, a detailed
study was carried out with two small cationic peptides, RQWRRWWQR-NH2 and RKFRRKFKK-NH2 with charges +4 and +7, respectively, which
are henceforth called pep+4 and pep+7, in which the N-terminal amines
were not considered for the charge of these peptides. In the first
step, the two peptides were synthesized, and their antimicrobial activity
was tested. In the second step, the activity of these peptides was
associated with the level of perturbation of a phospholipid bilayer
of DPPC in the presence of different concentrations of the peptide
adsorbed on its surface. The reason why a zwitterionic membrane was
chosen as the cell membrane model instead of a negatively charged
one (which could be associated with a pathogen cell membrane) is that
(as was described recently in the dynamic action mechanism of antimicrobial
peptides17) the activity of these peptides
arises from the induction of phospholipid domains in the pathogen
membrane, and the subsequent insertion of the peptides into the rich
domains of zwitterionic phospholipids, when the peptide reaches a
certain concentration on the outer cell membrane.

This work
also studies the thermodynamic process associated with
insertion of the peptide into the membrane and how the architecture
of the cell membrane is perturbed in the presence of cationic peptides
of different charges.

Results
Antibacterial Activity
Two peptides were chosen, whose structural characteristics
it was thought, would give different activities and allow their molecular
behavior to be evaluated when they interact with the biological membrane.

We previously reported that pep+4 possesses a significant antifungal
activity against Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans,30 whereas pep+7 does not have any effect in this respect.31 However, the antibacterial activity of both
peptides has not been evaluated to date. It should be noted that in
both cases, amphipathic α-helical conformation has been reported
to be the most favorable. Thus, in the first step of the study, and
as a preliminary analysis, the Edmundson wheels obtained for these
two peptides were evaluated (see Figure 1). From this figure, it is evident that pep+4
has two perfect differentiated faces of a similar size: a cationic
face (marked with blue cut lines) and a most hydrophobic face (represented
by solid yellow lines). The first face identifies residues R4, Q8,
R1, R5, and R9, accounting for the mutual Coulombic binding. These
residues are located on the same side of the helical peptide, which
was therefore designated the charged face. These positively charged
residues are able to interact with the hydrophilic part of the lipids.
The noncharged face is formed by three hydrophobic (W6, W3, and W7)
residues and one polar (Q2) residue. This type of distribution has
been proposed as an essential structural characteristic for this type
of peptide to present antibacterial28 and
antifungal31 activity. By contrast, pep+7
(Figure 1) has a large
cationic face covering most of the Edmundson representation where
all the cationic residues are concentrated (R4, K8, R1, R5, K9, K2,
and K6) and only a small hydrophobic portion formed by F3 and F7.
This is a striking difference with respect to pep+4.

Figure 1 Edmundson representation
obtained for the two peptides, pep+4 and
pep+7.

To make a more accurate evaluation
of the differential structural
characteristics of these two peptides, in a second stage of the study
an electronic analysis of these compounds was performed by analyzing
their molecular electrostatic potentials (MEPs).32 Molecular electrostatic fields and MEPs provide a relevant
description of the capacity of peptides to generate stereoelectrostatic
forces. More positive potentials reflect nucleus predominance, while
less positive values represent rearrangements of electronic charges
and lone pair of electrons. The MEPs of peptides pep+4 and pep+7 are
shown in Figure 2.
To better appreciate the electronic behavior of pep+4 and considering
that two different faces were signaled in Figure 1, we present the MEPs of pep+4 and pep+7,
showing the two faces. Figure 2a shows the charged face of pep+7, which is characterized
by the presence of seven cationic residues (R-1, K-8, R-5, K-9, K-6,
K-2, and R-4). It is clear from the figure that blue color shows the extended moiety of pep+7.
In turn, Figure 2b
shows the small portion of the hydrophobic zone of pep+7 characterized
by only two residues, F-3 and F7.

Figure 2 Electrostatic potential-encoded electron
density surfaces of the
structures of peptides pep+4 (c,d) and pep+7 (a,b). The coloring represents
electrostatic potential with red indicating the strongest attraction
to a positive point charge and blue indicating the strongest repulsion.
The electrostatic potential is the energy of interaction of the positive
point charge with the nuclei and electrons of a molecule. It provides
a representative measure of overall molecular charge distribution.

As expected, significant differences
can be seen in the electronic
distributions of pep+4 with respect to pep+7 (compare Figure 2a,b with 2c,d). Pep+4 shows two well-differentiated but similar-sized portions.
Its cationic face is characterized by the four cationic residues (R4,
R1, R5, and R9) and one polar residue (Q8), while the hydrophobic
face is formed by three hydrophobic amino acids (W6, W3, and W7) and
one polar residue (Q2). It has been previously reported that peptide
and lipid association occurs through the formation of salt bridges
between the positively charged residues and the lipid phosphate groups.33 In addition, tryptophan fluorescence studies
have previously shown the importance of positively charged residues
for the initial binding of these small peptides to negatively charged
vesicles because double R/K/A mutations significantly decreased the
binding affinity.34 The MEPs of pep+4 suggest
that the above-mentioned residues (R1, R4, R5, and R9) could be responsible
for the initial binding in pep+4.

It has been reported that
the mutation of strategically located
tryptophan residues decreases internalization, whereas double substitution
completely inhibits peptide internalization.35−37 It appears
that charge neutralization is required for the peptide to insert itself
deeply into the hydrophobic core of the membrane. A significant hydrophobic
face appears to be important in this sense. On the basis of our results,
it is reasonable to expect that pep+4 could present antibacterial
activity because, despite its small size, it meets the previously
established structural requirements for the active peptides. In contrast,
pep+7 should not possess any antibacterial effect. After obtaining
the stereoelectronic characteristic of the two peptides, our next
step was to evaluate their antibacterial activity. As expected, pep+4
showed a significant antibacterial activity against a panel of pathogenic
bacteria, whereas pep+7 had no antibacterial effect. In the next sections,
we present and discuss the results of extensive MD simulations to
explain at the molecular level the influence of charge on the antibacterial
activity of these small peptides.

Peptide Distribution
Figure 3 shows the peptide distribution function
for both types of peptides studied in this work, corresponding to
pep+4 and pep+7, after 100 ns of simulation time. In both figures,
it can be seen how pep+4 is distributed on both leaflets of the bilayer,
even though both peptides were placed near the same leaflet, as can
be seen in Figure 4.

of 40 pep+7 (red). Blue beads correspond to chloride ions used to
balance the total charge existing in the system. Water has been removed
for clarity.

Figure 3 shows that
the peptide concentration of pep+4 adsorbed on the membrane increases
almost linearly with the number of peptides added to the system. This
behavior permits a certain peptide threshold concentration to be reached
on the membrane surface that is sufficient to induce the disruption
of the bilayer structure, as was discussed elsewhere.17 By contrast, an increase in the pep+7 concentration is
not reflected in an increase in the peptide concentration on the surface,
making it almost impossible to reach a threshold concentration that
can perturb the membrane structure, that is, to show antimicrobial
activity. The migration of pep+7 in Figure 3 from one leaflet to the other is clearly
associated with the electrostatic repulsions between neighboring peptides
because of a poor charge screening between them, as a consequence
of their low ability to penetrate into the bilayer compared with the
behavior shown by pep+4. We remark that this migration of pep+7 from
one side to the other of the lipid bilayer takes place through the
water layer associated with the periodicity of the computational box
and never across the lipid bilayer.

Order Parameter, SCD, and Surface
Area per Lipid Molecule
The order parameter, SCD, provides information about the disorder in the hydrocarbon
region inside the lipid bilayer, a property that can be determined
experimentally from 2H NMR splittings. Thus, from the values
of quadrupolar splittings, ΔνQ, obtained from 2H NMR, the deuterium order parameter, SCD, can be calculated as follows 1  where C is the quadrupole
coupling constant (C = 170 kHz38) and SCD is the order parameter
of a given C–D bond. Furthermore, the order parameter can be
extracted directly from simulations using 2  Here, ϕ is the angle
between the C–D
bond and the bilayer normal and the average is obtained over the simulation
time and the number of identical molecules in the computational box.
However, bearing in mind that hydrogens from methylene groups are
not explicitly considered in DPPC in our simulations, the order parameter
corresponding to a given C–D bond can be calculated using a
methodology described elsewhere.39

Figure 5 shows how
the presence of pep+7 does not perturb the hydrocarbon structure in
the interior of the phospholipid bilayer throughout the range of concentrations
studied in this work. This behavior contrasts with that measured in
the presence of pep+4, in which, for a given peptide concentration
above a threshold value, a noticeable increase in the phospholipid
disorder is measured as the peptide concentration increases.

DPPC hydrocarbon tail of a DPPC bilayer, for different
peptide/phospholipid ratios, (a) pep+4 and (b) pep+7. Circles correspond
to the experimental data of a DPPC bilayer in the absence of peptides
at 350 K.40

Furthermore, Table 1 shows the surface area per lipid molecule for different peptide/lipid
ratios in our simulations and also shows how the presence of pep+7
produces a shrinkage in the surface area per phospholipid with respect
to its value in the absence of peptides in solution. This result contrasts
with those obtained in the presence of pep+4, in which the lipid surface
was seen to expand. These results closely agree with the results obtained
from the deuterium order parameter (see Figure 5), in which an increase in the disorder of
the hydrocarbon region with the P/L ratio was measured, which was
associated with an increase in the free space between adjacent phospholipids,
as it would be expected from an increase in the surface area per lipid
molecule.

Thickness of the Lipid Bilayer
To estimate the effect
of the presence of cationic peptides on the thickness of the lipid
bilayer, Figure 6 depicts
the phosphorus distribution on both lipid leaflets that form the lipid
bilayer, in the presence and absence of cationic peptides.

Figure 6 Phosphorous
distribution across the lipid bilayer for different
peptide/phospholipid ratios in the presence of pep+4 (a) and pep+7
(b).

Figure 6 shows how
the presence of pep+7 was no affected on the thickness of the lipid
bilayer at any concentration. This result contrasts with those obtained
for pep+4, where for a given threshold concentration a reduction of
20% in the thickness of the lipid bilayer was evident.

Bending Modulus, kb, of the Lipid
Bilayer
The bending modulus, kb, is calculated as follows 3  where KA corresponds
to the compressibility modulus of the membrane and ξ the effective
thickness of the lipid bilayer, calculated as ξ = dP–P – 1, where dP–P is the distance between the maximum of phosphorus distribution of
both lipid leaflets that form the lipid bilayer. KA is calculated as follows 4  where kB is the
Boltzmann constant, T the temperature, A the surface area per lipid molecule, and σ2(A) the mean square fluctuation of the interfacial area.

Table 2 shows the
bending modulus of the different systems studied in this work. In
the absence of peptides, a kb value of
29 kBT was measured for
the lipid DPPC bilayer. This value agrees with the experimental data
obtained from pipette aspiration41,42 and neutron
spin echo43 measurements, which gave values
of kb in a range of 11–30 kBT, depending on the length
of the lipid hydrocarbon tails and temperature.

Pep-7	29	28.3	32	30	
Pep-4	29	36	48	22	
a kB corresponds
to the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.

In the presence of pep+7, kb remains
almost unaltered over the whole range of concentrations studied as
a consequence of the poor interactions between the peptides and the
lipid bilayer, as discussed above. By contrast, in the presence of
pep+4, kb increased as the number of peptides
adsorbed on the surface of the lipid bilayer increased as well, until
a given threshold concentration was reached, corresponding to a peptide/lipid
ratio of 1/8, when kb is 25% lower than
that of the value of the lipid bilayer in the absence of peptides.
This sharp decrease in the bending modulus of the lipid bilayer (i.e.,
an increase in its flexibility) gives an idea of how the mechanical
properties of the lipid membrane are disrupted, as a prelude of the
lytic activity of these cationic peptides.

Lateral Pressure, π(z)
The lateral
pressure profile across a lipid bilayer, π(z), is a key aspect related with its mechanical stability. Computationally,
the lateral pressure profile can be estimated using the algorithm
of Lindhal and Edholm,44 where a detailed
description of how this property is calculated can be found elsewhere.17

In this regard, Figure 7 shows the lateral pressure profile, π(z), for the DPPC bilayer in the absence and presence of
peptides adsorbed on the membrane.

Figure 7 Lateral pressure π(z) of the DPPC bilayer
in the absence and presence of peptides for different peptide/phospholipid
ratios. (a) Corresponds to pep+4 and (b) to pep+7.

Unfortunately, there is not an experimental verification
of this
property, although the results obtained in our simulations are in
a reasonable agreement with the results provided by Kamo et al.45 from fluorescence measurements, in which a lateral
pressure of 350 atm was estimated in the middle of a lipid bilayer.

Figure 7 shows how
the pressure profile is not perturbed by the presence of pep+7 in
comparison with the case in which pep+4 is present, showing the existence
of a threshold concentration from which a noticeable perturbation
of the bilayer stability takes place. In this regard, and on the basis
that an increase in the pressure is associated with an increase in
the instability of the bilayer architecture, this behavior is in good
agreement with the higher antimicrobial activity of pep+4 than pep+7,
in spite of its high positive charge. However, in both cases, the
main perturbation takes place in the vicinity of the phospholipid/water
interface, in line with the discussion described above.

Thermodynamic
Study of Peptide Insertion in the Lipid Bilayer
Free Energy Associated
with Peptide Insertion into the Lipid
Bilayer
The partition function of a certain species between
two mediums is directly related with the difference of free energy
associated with this process, as follows 5  where C(z) corresponds to the species concentration at
a certain position z perpendicular to the interface
and C*
its concentration in the bulk solution. To estimate the potential
mean force (PMF) associated with the insertion of peptides into a
lipid bilayer, two peptides were considered simultaneously in our
simulations, and the Umbrella46 and WHAM47 were the computational methods used to estimate
the PMF. Thus, we placed one of the two peptides in bulk water and
the other in the middle of the lipid bilayer formed by 288 DPPC (144
DPPC per leaflet) and 17 516 water molecules with their corresponding
Cl– to balance the charges of the system. Hence,
starting from this first conformation, peptides were displaced along
the Z-axis to estimate the PMF across the lipid bilayer.17

Figure 8 shows ΔG(z) corresponding to the insertion into the DPPC bilayer of the two
cationic peptides studied in this work. From Figure 8, it can be seen how the adsorption of peptides
into a lipid bilayer is a spontaneous process for both peptides, which
corresponds to the negative values of ΔG(z). However, this process is −37 kJ/mol lower for
pep+7 than for pep+4, as a consequence of the strong electrostatic
interactions between peptide/lipid bilayers. On the other hand, a
thermodynamic barrier to the insertion of these peptides into the
bilayer emerged, which is 39 kJ/mol higher for pep+7 than for pep+4.
This difference may be associated with the existence of tryptophan
residues in pep+4 but not in pep+7, and hence, its insertion into
the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer is favored. Hence, from
this thermodynamic study, we conclude that the insertion of pep+4
into the core of the hydrocarbon region of the lipid bilayer is easier
than it is for pep+7, which could explain its antibacterial activity.
For its part, pep+7 cannot penetrate into the membrane to disrupt
the membrane structure and hence perturbs the mechanical properties
of the lipid membrane to provide lytic activity, remaining anchored
to the surface of the lipid bilayer.

the insertion of cationic
peptides into a DPPC bilayer. (b) Atomic phosphorous distribution

Enthalpy and Entropy of the Peptide Insertion
Obtaining
thermodynamic information related to peptide insertion into the lipid
bilayer is of crucial importance in order to understand the thermodynamic
driving force that rules the interaction of these small cationic peptides
with a lipid membrane.

In this regard, from classical thermodynamics,
it is known that entropy ΔS, enthalpy ΔH, and the free energy ΔG are related
by the well-known expression 6  where ΔH and
ΔS correspond to the variation of enthalpy
(energy) and entropy
(disorder) involved with this thermodynamic process.

According
to classical thermodynamics, the variation of entropy
associated with a given thermodynamic process can be calculated from
the variation in free energy at two different temperatures, as follows 7  

A solution to
this differential equation can be approximated numerically
as follows 8  

Thus, from the free-energy profile of ΔG at two different temperatures, the entropy of peptide insertion
into a phospholipid bilayer can be estimated. Once ΔS has been calculated, the enthalpic contribution to the
free energy can also be estimated, using eq 6. In our case, two additional profiles of
free energy corresponding to 340 and 360 K were obtained. Figure 9 shows the free energy
(ΔG), enthalpy (ΔH),
and entropy (ΔS) profiles associated with the
insertion of pep+4 and pep+7 to the lipid bilayer at 350 K.

Figure 9 ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS associated with the insertion of pep+4 and pep+7 into
a DPPC bilayer.

With regard to pep+4,
we observe how ΔH is
negative (exothermic process) in the vicinity of the lipid/water interface
with a value of −194 kJ/mol (or −46.4 kcal/mol) and
becomes positive (endothermic) in the middle of the lipid bilayer,
with a value of 189 kJ/mol (or 45 kcal/mol). The binding enthalpy
of pep+4 to the lipid bilayer is a reasonable good agreement with
the values of −14.4 and −17.0 kcal/mol measured by isothermal
titration calorimetry of pexiganan48 and
magainin-2 bound to vesicles,26,48,49 once the difference in size and charge between these species has
been discounted. With regard to the variation of entropy, there was
a decrease at the vicinity of the bilayer/water interface (as expected
for strong electrostatic interactions with the polar head of lipids
at the lipid/water interface), followed by an increase toward the
aliphatic region inside the bilayer. Thus, from the analysis of ΔH and ΔS, it is concluded that insertion
into the lipid bilayer is governed by an increase in the entropic
contribution to the free energy inside of the lipid bilayer.

In the case of pep+7, ΔH presents a minimum
of −139 kJ/mol in the vicinity of the lipid bilayer (or −33
kcal/mol), a value that is also in reasonable agreement with the values
of ΔH for pexiganan and magainin-2 bound to
vesicles, as mentioned above. It is important to note that unlike
pep+4, ΔH follows the same trend as ΔG, as a consequence of the almost null contribution of the
entropy to the free energy. This means that the free energy is mainly
dominated by its energetic term, ΔH, while
the contribution of the entropy to the free energy is very low. This
low contribution of the entropy is associated with the strong electrostatic
interactions between the peptides and the polar heads of phospholipids,
which dramatically reduces the mobility of these peptides at the bilayer/solution
interface, in perfect agreement with the results obtained by simulation.

This interpretation is based on the results concerning the disorder
of lipid bilayers in the presence of peptides. Thus, in the presence
of pep+4, a decrease in the order parameters (an increase in the disorder
in the hydrocarbon region of the lipids) of phospholipids was measured,
unlike in the case of pep+7, in which the order parameters of the
phospholipids remained constant over the whole range of peptide concentrations
studied in this work.

From the analysis and comparison of ΔG,
ΔH, and ΔS for both
peptides, we conclude that an excess of charge reduces the disorder
inside the lipid bilayer associated with the presence of these peptides,
that is, the possibility of disrupting the lipid bilayer structure
decreases. Hence, the results suggest that entropy is the key property
that must be investigated to predict the antimicrobial activity of
these small cationic peptides.

Conclusions
There
are many theoretical and experimental studies that have focused
on the influence of charge on the antibacterial activity of these
small peptides. In this sense, it is known that to achieve a certain
level of antimicrobial activity, the charge of these cationic peptides
must be between +2 and +9 (depending on the size of the peptide).
The results presented in this work are the first to provide an explanation
(at the molecular level) of why charged peptides are not able to reach
the threshold concentration necessary to produce the deformation of
the membrane, that is, its subsequent biological activity.

To
increase our knowledge of the role played by the charge in the
antimicrobial activity of new synthetic peptides, two peptides with
charges +4 and +7 were studied. From in vitro studies, it was demonstrated
how the peptide with charge +7 does not show antimicrobial activity,
whereas the peptides with charge +4 do.

From the thermodynamic
study of peptide insertion into a phospholipid
bilayer of DPPC, and evaluation of the bilayer structure in the absence
and presence of a peptide, it has been shown how a peptide with charge
+7 does not reach the threshold concentration necessary to induce
membrane disruption. This behavior seems to be associated with the
fact that poor insertion into the lipid bilayer cannot screen out
the electrostatic repulsion between peptides, and there is mutual
repulsion between neighboring peptides, resulting in a low concentration
of peptides adsorbed on the lipid bilayer. This behavior contrasts
with that obtained for the peptide with charge +4, whose tendency
to protrude into the lipid bilayer reduces the electrostatic repulsions
between neighboring peptides. This behavior permits a threshold concentration
that is sufficient to induce the disruption of the membrane, that
is, its lytic activity.

Finally, a thermodynamic study of the
peptide insertion into the
lipid bilayer points to the entropy being the key property that links
the charge/structure of these peptides with their lytic activity.

Model
and Methods
Antimicrobial Peptides
Two different peptides were
used as models in the study with primary structures RQWRRWWQR-NH2 (pep+4) and RKFRRKFKK-NH2 (pep+7), with charges +4 and +7,
respectively. General information about the synthesis of both peptides
is given below, and for more details, see refs (30) and (31).

Peptide Synthesis and Antibacterial
Activity
The synthesis
of both peptides described above was carried out in a solid phase,
following the experimental procedure described elsewhere.30 The microorganism used to determine their antibacterial
activity was provided by the laboratorio de Microbiologia, Facultad
de Ciencias Medicas, Universidad Nacional de Cuyo, Mendoza, Argentina,
Laboratorio de Microbiologia, Hospital Marcial Quiroga, San Juan,
Argentina, and Pasteur Institute. Furthermore, the minimal inhibitory
concentrations of these peptides were determined using the broth microdilution
method following the methodology described elsewhere,29 in which all the assays were carried out in triplicate.

Cell Membrane Model
A zwitterionic phospholipid bilayer
of DPPC composed of 648 DPPC molecules (324 per leaflet) and 28 526
water molecules of the single point charge (SPC)50 was considered as the cell membrane model in our simulations.
The reason for choosing a zwitterionic bilayer for the simulations
is based on the previous results obtained for the dynamics action
mechanism.17 This work17 demonstrated how small cationic peptides induce phospholipid segregations
of lipid domains, prior to showing lytic activity, when they reach
a threshold concentration on the surface of the cell membrane and
then penetrate into the membrane of those domains that are rich in
zwitterionic phospholipids.

MD Simulations
GROMACS 4.5.351,52 was the package used to carry out the MD simulations. All the simulations
were performed in NPT conditions, using the algorithm proposed by
Berendsen,53 with coupling constants of
0.1 and 1 ps for temperature and pressure, respectively. The temperature
of all our simulations was 350 K, which is above the transition temperature
of 314 K of DPPC bilayers.38 The long-range
interactions were simulated using the Lennard-Jones potential, and
the electrostatic interactions were calculated using the particle
mesh Ewald method54,55 with a cutoff of 1 nm. The molecular
bonds were restrained using LINCS algorithm.56 The SPC water model50 was considered
in all our simulations.

A trajectory length of 200 ns was simulated
in all the cases studied in this work. The force field used in this
work was the same as that described in a previous work17 using the GROMOS 54A7 force field57 implemented in the GROMACS package.

Molecular Electrostatic
Potentials
Quantum mechanics
calculations were carried out using the Gaussian 09 program,58 and the most populated conformations of peptides one and two were
obtained from MD simulations. Subsequently, single point density functional
theory (DFT) calculations were carried out. Correlation effects were
included using DFT with the Becke-3–Lee–Yang–Parr
(RB3LYP)59,60 functional and 6-31++G(d,p) basis set for
all the complexes. During the DFT calculations, the geometries were
kept fixed. The electronic study was carried out using MEPs.32 Graphical presentations were created using the
MOLEKEL program 2.3.3 MEPs.
