Delivery of growth factors is an
indispensable part of tissue engineering.
Here, we describe a detachable membrane-based release system composed
of extracellular matrix components that can be attached to hydrogels
to achieve directional release of bioactive molecules. This way, the
release of cytokines/growth factors can be started at a desired point
of tissue maturation or directly in vivo. As a model, we develop thin
films of an interpenetrating network of double-cross-linked gelatin
and hyaluronic acid derivatives. The use of the auxiliary release
system with vascular endothelial growth factor results in extensive
sprouting by encapsulated vascular endothelial cells. The presence
of the release system with interleukin-4 results in clustering of
encapsulated macrophages with a significant decrease in M1 macrophages
(proinflammatory). This system can be used in conjunction with three-dimensional
structures as an auxiliary system to control artificial tissue maturation
and growth.

Introduction
Cells need specific
bioactive molecules for adhesion, migration,
proliferation, or differentiation. These bioactive molecules are crucial
for events such as angiogenesis and osteogenesis or for the modulation
of the immune response after implantation.1 To provide these molecules to the cells, many strategies have been
developed using different biomaterials as release platforms.2 To develop an efficient release platform, two
main parameters must be controlled: (i) the degradation rate of the
platform to control the temporal release of the molecules and (ii)
the chemical or physical interaction between the material and the
molecules to control the loading of the molecules. To this purpose,
bioactive molecules have been incorporated in biomaterials mainly
through either covalent or noncovalent approaches.3 However, for tissue engineering purposes, the direct incorporation
of the growth factors limits the level of control over the timeline
of biological events. A decoupling of the cell-containing parts of
tissue-engineering scaffolds and their release component can provide
a more modular way to control cell behavior both in vitro and in vivo.

To overcome this problem, another approach can be considered with
the development of film-based release platforms that are in direct
contact with the cell-containing scaffolds such as cell-laden hydrogels.
Film-based release systems ensure an efficient presentation of bioactive
agents as the film defines the location of the reservoir distinctly,
that is, the bioactive agents will not diffuse from the implantation
site immediately. In vivo, one of the most important characteristics
of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules is their ability to act as
a reservoir for growth factors; ECM can regulate their activation,
synthesis, degradation, and their release into
the surrounding environment. For example, vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF) is known to interact with heparin, heparin sulfate,
hyaluronan (HA), and fibronectin. Recombinant human bone morphogenetic
protein-2 (rhBMP-2) and rhBMP-7 interact with heparin, heparin sulfate,
or collagen.4 Considering these specific
interactions, a release platform with the right biomaterial composition
can be designed for long-term growth factor release. Over the past
few years, biomaterial systems such as ECM-based scaffolds (gelatin,
collagen, HA) and polyelectrolyte multilayer films have been used
to load and release bioactive molecules for tissue engineering purposes.
Such thin-film-based structures can be produced in a free-standing
manner.5 Recently, our group designed an
ECM-mimicking surface coating as an alternative cell culture microenvironment.
This ECM-based material is made of thin film of concentrated gelatin
made by the spin coating process and enzymatically cross-linked with
microbial Ca2+-independent transglutaminase (TGA). This
cell feeder platform can provide bioactive molecules, and its stiffness
can be modified through the addition of nanoparticles to modulate
the cell behavior.6 However, for more effective
retention of growth factors, incorporation of more than one component
of ECM would be necessary. In this way, the auxiliary release system,
designed in this study, will not only interact with different growth
factors in a specific manner but also act as a substrate for incoming
cells without inducing adverse immune reactions.

Hyaluronic
acid (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan, which plays an important
role in cell differentiation, angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory response,
and cell growth.7 Thus, it is a good candidate
to design biomaterials if it is combined with other ECM components
that promote cell adhesion. To improve mechanical properties of HA
and to make a strong gel, it is possible to cross-link HA after chemical
modification of its functional groups, for example, by methacrylation
or using hydrazide derivatives.8 Collagen,
collagen-like biomaterials such as gelatin, and collagen-/gelatin-based
composites have been used for a long time in tissue engineering as
drug delivery carriers for bioactive molecules.9 To mimic natural microenvironment, we have used two ECM
components, gelatin type B (denaturated collagen) and HA, to design
the release platform.10 To adjust the physical
parameters of the composite gelatin/HA film, tyramine-conjugated HA
is used. HA-tyramine (HA-tyr) can be cross-linked by the horseradish-mediated
reaction11 using horseradish peroxidase
(HRP), and gelatin is enzymatically cross-linked using TGA.6 Consequently, the resulting film is double-cross-linked
and forms an interpenetrating network, which will improve the stability
of the composite and its capacity to retain growth factors and cytokines.

In the integration of the engineered soft tissues, two biological
events are of particular import: (i) integration of the delivered
scaffold with the host vascularization and (ii) a controlled inflammatory
response to the implanted system that is resolved in a time scale
similar to that for normal wound healing to facilitate and promote
healing/integration. An auxiliary delivery system can establish the
contact of the engineered tissue with the host vasculature and immune
system. The VEGF and interleukin-4 (IL-4) were used as model molecules
to be delivered. VEGF is a potent angiogenic growth factor and IL-4
is an established anti-inflammatory cytokine, which has been shown
to induce M2 (remodeling inducing) macrophage phenotype. For quantification
of vascular endothelial cell and monocyte/macrophage responses to
the delivery system in both two dimensions (2D) and three dimensions
(3D), human umbilical cord vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and
a human monocytic cell line (THP-1) cells were utilized.

In
this study, we demonstrated the added value of the incorporation
of a separate release platform to the tissue-engineering scaffold
using a cell delivery system based on cell-laden gelatin hydrogels,
which contain as an auxiliary component a spin-coated composite of
gelatin and HA-tyr derivatives for controlled release of cytokines
and growth factors to the encapsulated cells (Figure 1). The gelatin/HA-tyr film is used as a reservoir
of cytokines to obtain a sustained release. As a proof of concept,
we quantified the effect of release of VEGF or IL-4 on vascular endothelial
cells or human monocytes, respectively, in a 3D culture environment.
In this work, gelatin and gelatin/unmodified HA films will be considered
as single cross-linked films (TGA) and those of gelatin/HA-tyr as
double-cross-linked films (TGA + HRP).

for engineered tissues.

Results and Discussion
Naturally derived polymers are attractive
for tissue engineering
because of being the building blocks of the ECM.13 They have been widely used in a composite form (such as
composites of gelatin with HA,14 chitosan,15 and silk16). HA presents
the ability to act as a binding site for molecules. Hence, one important
advantage of gelatin–HA composites is the strength of both
materials. The synergistic use of gelatin with other materials enables
more precise material degradation and controlled release. As the first
component of the final system, we first analyzed the distribution
of unmodified HA when spin-coated with gelatin and cross-linked with
TGA. The composition of this single cross-linked film was 14% w/v
gelatin and 1% w/v unmodified HA. Labeled HA was observed to be distributed
homogeneously throughout the film thickness (Figure 2C). The average film thickness was estimated
to be 13 μm (Figure 2A). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of the surface
and the cross section of the film demonstrated a smooth, homogeneous
surface (Figure 2B).
Both gelatin-only and gelatin/unmodified HA films (single cross-linked)
were stable in culture conditions up to 3 days; however, the entire
film was detached from the surface after 7 days (Figure 2D).

within the film. (D) Stability of the gelatin/HA film at 37 °C
in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) without poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI)
as a first layer after 3 and 7 days.

Thus, to ensure a long-term stability of the film, a cross-linkable
HA derivative was used to obtain a double-cross-linked composite,
an interpenetrating network of gelatin and HA (Figure 3A). To this end, we have used tyraminated
HA. Previously, Lee et al. used a H2O2/HRP-based
cross-linking for encapsulation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs),
within hydroxyphenylpropionic acid-conjugated gelatin hydrogels. These
gels did not have any cytotoxic effect on MSCs and facilitate endothelial
differentiation of the encapsulated MSCs.17 The average thickness of this gelatin/HA-tyr double-cross-linked
film was estimated by confocal images to be approximately 15 μm
(Figure 3B). When cultured
in 2D conditions both with HUVEC and THP-1 cells, all of the films
tested lead to the same results in terms of cell viability. The addition
of HA-tyr did not have a negative effect on cell viability compared
to that of gelatin/HA or gelatin-only films cross-linked with TGA
(Figure 3C,D). To improve
the stability, an anchoring layer of PEI was deposited on the glass
slide before developing films (Figure S1). As it can be seen in Figure S1B, the
PEI/gelatin/HA-tyr film presents a better stability until day 7. We
have decided to use the gelatin/HA-tyr film for the next part of our
study because of the better film stability compared to that of gelatin
and gelatin/unmodified HA and the similar cell response in terms of
viability.

gelatin/HA-tyr film. (B) Three-dimensional confocal pictures of the
gelatin/HA-tyr film cross-linked with TGA and HRP and fluorescently

for HUVECs (C) and THP-1 cells (D) seeded on gelatin and gelatin/HA
derivative (unmodified and tyramine) films for 1 and 3 days. The experiment
was performed on three different samples for each condition.

The mechanical properties of gelatin/unmodified
HA and gelatin/HA-tyr
films were quantified by the atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanoindentation
technique (Figure S3). The double-cross-linked
gelatin/HA-tyr film shows an increase of 30% in Young’s modulus
compared to that in the gelatin/unmodified HA-only film cross-linked
with TGA. The addition of HA-tyr without the cross-linking step decreases
Young’s modulus. This can be attributed to the ability of HA
to absorb a large quantity of water, which will decrease the overall
stiffness of the material. The gelatin/HA-tyr film presents a lower
Young modulus (28 ± 7 kPa) than that from gelatin/unmodified
HA (44 ± 4 kPa), although both have been cross-linked only by
TGA. However, once the gelatin/HA-tyr film is cross-linked by the
action of the enzyme HRP (double-cross-linked film), its Young modulus
increases (58 ± 6 kPa). Moreover, one main advantage of the double-cross-linked
interpenetrating network structure is the significant improvement
in the stability of the films. The double-cross-linked gelatin/HA-tyr
film was stable under the culture conditions up to 21 days. In addition,
this film can be obtained as a self-standing membrane by depositing
a sacrificial layer on top of the glass slide before the spin-coating
process. This layer decreases the interaction between the film and
the glass slide, and the film is detached easily once immersed in
water (Figure S3).

Huang et al. recently
showed that a disulfide-cross-linked semi-interpenetrating
network of collagen and RGD-functionalized HA can be used for the
sustained release of rhBMP-2. On titanium implants, this coating system
resulted in increased removal torque compared to that on titanium
implants in an in vivo rabbit implantation model. This indicates an
improved integration of the coated implant with the surrounding bone
tissue. Moreover, they showed that disulfide cross-linking improved
the stability of the coating up to 14 days and sustained the release
of rhBMP-2 for 10 days.18 In film format,
Crouzier et al. also studied the loading and the long-term release
of rhBMP-2 from cross-linked poly(l-lysine)/HA films for
controlled differentiation of C2C12 cells to osteoblasts.19 Using a reservoir/barrier system made of PLL/HA
as a reservoir and PAH/PSS as a mechanosensitive barrier, a platform
that can release drug with enzymatic degradation triggered by mechanical
stimuli has been developed that can be applied to the current system
in tissues that are mechanically active.20 However, one disadvantage of such a system is the limitation of
growth factor loading just after the manufacture of the release platform.

In our case, there are two possibilities for the loading of the
growth factors, which will lead to different release profiles: (i)
the deposition of the desired amount of growth factor onto the preformed
films (Figure 4A) and
(ii) incorporation of the growth factors during film formation (Figure 4B). To quantify the
differences in the released growth factors and their release profiles,
VEGF and IL-4 release from the films produced by both methods was
monitored by ELISA for 6 days (Figure 4C–F). Even though incorporation of the growth
factors into the film production potentially improves the loading,
it significantly decreased the amount of bioactive
agent available for both IL-4 and VEGF upon release (Figure 4D–F). This may be attributed
to the cross-linking of the bioactive molecules inside the film with
TGA. When the bioactive molecules are incubated on the preformed film
(Figure 4C,E), we can
observe a steady release of the growth factors up to 144 h after an
initial burst release.

B) Schematic
representation of different loading ways of growth factors inside
gelatin/HA-tyr cross-linked films. Release profile determined by the
ELISA test over 144 h for VEGF (C, D) and IL-4 (E, F) at 37 °C
in PBS. For C–F, fresh supernatant was added after each record
and three samples for each condition were used.

Most of the systems developed for the release of bioactive
molecules
were based on the encapsulation of the molecules into micro-nanoparticles,
and their release was achieved through the degradation of these particles.21 The main problem with this approach is the difficulty
of restricting the particle presence to a specific target, as particularly
nanoparticles can diffuse within the host quite easily. There are
potential side effects due to the random distribution of the particles
inside the host. Direct incorporation of growth factors into the gels
without covalent immobilization leads to the rapid leakage of them,
which prevents the attainment of the desired effects. Although covalent
immobilization can solve the leakage problem, it excludes the possible
effect on the incoming cells from the host tissue via release. A dedicated
compartment for release in an engineered tissue can both partially
solve the leakage problem without affecting the gel properties and enable the
interaction with the host tissues via controlled release. To demonstrate
that such a directional release is possible, we attached gelatin hydrogels
to the film loaded with a fluorescently labeled biomolecule. As a
model, we have used fluorescently labeled BSAFITC and labeled
the hydrogel with a red fluorescent probe (PLLRho) to monitor
the release of BSAFITC over time from the film to the hydrogel
with a confocal microscope (Figure 5). The hydrogel was labeled with a red fluorescent
probe to localize it with a confocal microscope and also to demonstrate
the fast release of directly incorporated molecules. In the beginning,
the presence of BSAFITC was limited to the film layer,
but over time a steady release of BSAFITC into the gel
thickness was observed via xz sections obtained by
confocal microscopy (Figure 5A), and by 144 h, the whole hydrogel thickness contained BSAFITC. More importantly, during this period, the fluorescence in the film
layer was maintained, demonstrating the role of reservoir for the
film, whereas the loaded rhodaminated PLL slowly diffused out of the
structure and the signal was fainter by 144 h. The quantification
of the total amount of BSA available in the gel showed a statistically
significant increase by 144 h (Figure 5B). The experimental setup is illustrated in Figure 5C.

(3D). (A) Confocal images of the two-layer system at different time
points, with the gelatin/HA-tyr cross-linked film layer labeled with
BSAFITC with a 6% w/v gelatin hydrogel cross-linked with
a 20% w/v TGA solution labeled with PLLRho (red fluorescent
probe) on top of it. Starting from 1 h, the diffusion of BSAFIT from the film to the hydrogel was monitored (from left to right,
the green and red channels are merged, the red channel
to localize the hydrogel labeled with the red fluorescent probe and
the green channel to localize the film with BSAFITC initially
loaded inside). Overtime, we can see the green fluorescence (BSAFITC) initially localized in the film (bottom part) moving
to the hydrogel (upper part in red), which means that BSA has diffused
from the film to the hydrogel. (B) Quantification of the green fluorescence
(BSAFITC) in the hydrogel at different times normalized
by the area of the hydrogel (p ≤ 0.05). (C)
Schematic representation of the experimental setup.

The effect of IL-4 release was checked for the
THP-1 cells directly
seeded on the release system. Gelatin/HA-tyr films supported the growth
of the THP-1 cells attached on their surface up to 21 days with metabolic
activity similar to that of gelatin-only films (Figure 6A). Once, IL-4 was loaded in the films, a
decrease in the number of necrotic cells was observed, even though
the change is only statistically significant within 90% confidence
interval (p = 0.063) (Figure 6B). Moreover, even though high cell numbers
were obtained on the films, after 21 days, nearly 80% of the film
was still in place, both in the presence and absence of IL-4 (Figure 6C).

on three different samples.

To demonstrate the efficacy of the films as a release platform
to cells in 3D, our final system is composed of a cell-laden gelatin-based
hydrogel cross-linked with TGA fixed to the release system. We have
monitored two events under 3D conditions that can be controlled by
the presence of growth factors/cytokines: (i) sprouting behavior of
vascular endothelial cells and (ii) macrophage phenotype control (specifically
differentiation to M2 macrophages). In 3D conditions, for HUVEC cells
to form sprouts, the presence of a supporting mesenchyme cell type
is generally necessary. In line with this observation, in the absence
of VEGF release, HUVECs in the hydrogels have spread in a limited
amount with a low degree of organization (Figure 7A), whereas there was significant sprouting
in the case of VEGF release by day 14 (Figure 7B). This was accompanied by a significant
increase in the metabolic activity of HUVECs under VEGF release conditions,
which was maintained up until day 14 (Figure 7C). Nitric oxide is an important biological
agent in vascular homeostasis and endothelial cell function, and the
low levels of NO secretion by endothelial cells have been implicated
with several pathologies including hypertension, heart failure, and
diabetes mellitus. HUVECs have secreted up to 25 μM NO (detected
as nitrite) in both the absence and the presence of VEGF. The NO levels
increased steadily up until day 10 and then stabilized (Figure 7D).

loaded in the gelatin/HA-tyr film to
the hydrogel with HUVECs encapsulated. (A, B) Confocal images with
DAPI (blue)/phalloidin (red) and PECAM-1 (green) staining after 14
days of experiment with and without VEGF release. (C) Metabolic activity

release from the film (three different samples; p ≤ 0.05). (D) Nitride oxide quantification via the nitrite
detection kit in the supernatant until day 14 of the cell experiment
(three different samples; p ≤ 0.05).

The availability of the released
VEGF in the presence of the cells
was quantified after 14 days of culture (Figure S5A). By day 14, still around 500 pg mL–1 of VEGF was available. There is a small contribution of the cells’
own secretion of VEGF in this, but the amount
released under no-VEGF conditions was significantly lower compared
to that released under the conditions when VEGF was available. For
determining whether the release of VEGF induces the release of other
cytokines, we also quantified the levels of several cytokines that
are known to be released by endothelial cells (IL-1RA, IL-6, IL-8)
by ELISA. There was no detectable release of IL-1RA and IL-6 (Figure S4), but IL-8 was released both in no-VEGF
and VEGF release conditions (Figure S5B). By day 10 and day 14, there was significantly higher amount of
IL-8 in the medium in the VEGF release conditions in 3D. This is in
line with our observations of sprouting in the case of VEGF release,
as IL-8 has been demonstrated to be directly involved in the proliferation,
survival, and tube formation by endothelial cells and antibody blocking
of IL-8 prevents the capillary tube organization.22 In that condition, cells were cultured in a more proangiogenic
microenvironment.

Encapsulation of macrophages in ECM-based
hydrogels creates a microenvironment
similar to that of tissue macrophages, which are responsible for the
homeostasis of the corresponding tissue. In our model, we encapsulated
monocytes and, via induction with an M2 phenotype inducing cytokine,
we aimed to control the differentiation and phenotype of the encapsulated
monocytes. THP-1 cells proliferated in hydrogels up to 21 days either
with or without IL-4 release (Figure 8A). However, the cell numbers were significantly higher
in IL-4 release samples from day 3 to 14 (p <
0.05). The IL-4 release resulted in distinct morphological differences.
In IL-4 release samples, THP-1 cells formed large clusters, whereas
in no release samples, they were equally distributed within the hydrogel
(Figure 8B,C). Clumping
during macrophage-like cell differentiation of THP-1 has been stated
previously.23 Moreover, we have observed
a distinctly higher CD206 expression by the encapsulated cells with
IL-4 compared to that from without IL-4 samples, which is a well-known
M2 phenotype marker (Figure 8E,F). Encapsulation itself had a positive effect on the expression
of several M2-related genes, such as IL-10, CD163, and IL-1RA compared
to THP-1 cells in suspension (Figure S6). However, this increase was accompanied by increase in M1-related
genes CD86, STAT-1, IL-6, and TNF-α. Once the IL-4 was released,
the expression
of M1-related genes significantly decreased (Figure 8D). At protein level, TNF-α release
by cells in IL-4 samples was significantly lower compared to that
from those in the samples without IL-4 on day 1, after which TNF-α
release gradually faded (Figure S7A). The
IL-4 release significantly improved the IL-1RA (a M2 marker) secretion
by cells (Figure S7B), whereas CCL18 secretion
was observed only on day 14 in both cases (Figure S7C). Overall, the encapsulation of monocytes induced M2 differentiation
and the presence of the auxiliary release system augmented the effect.

Conclusions
Engineering a tissue
requires the design of the optimal conditions
for the cells in the target tissue involved. Additionally, it is also
crucial to develop methods to recruit and direct the host cells that
will take an active role in the integration of the implanted tissue.
A modular ECM-based biomembrane-controlled release system can be used
as a component of engineered tissues for directional release of cytokines
and growth factors to attain precise microenvironment control. Development
of a system composed of two modular components decouples the release
and cell loading, which allows a higher degree of control over the
encapsulated cell behavior. We have demonstrated the efficacy of the
system for two cell types. Our future work will focus on co-cultures
and multifactor release in this configuration.

Experimental Section
Material
for Gelatin/HA (Gel/HA) Film Construction and Characterization
Gelatin type B (Mw = 2–2.5 ×
104 Da) from bovine skin, gelatin type A (Mw = 5–10 × 104 Da) from porcine
skin, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled bovine albumin (BSAFITC, Mw = 6.6 × 104 Da),
and cellulose acetate (Mw = 3 × 104 Da) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier,
France). Microbial TGA (Mw = 3.8 ×
104 Da) was kindly provided by Ajinomoto (Japan). HA (Mw = 3 × 105 Da) and HA-tyr (Mw = 3.1 × 105 Da) were produced
and characterized by Contipro (Dolni Dobrouc, Czech Republic). Human
recombinant VEGF165 (Mw = 3.82
× 104 Da) and human IL-4 (Mw = 1.5 × 104 Da) were purchased from Promocell (Germany).

Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled poly(l-lysine) (PLLFITC) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Quentin Fallavier,
France). PLLRho was synthesized in our laboratory by coupling
PLL to rhodamine Red-X, succinimidyl ester (Invitrogen, France).

Spin-Coating of Gelatin/HA Films
Gelatin/HA and gelatin/HA-tyr
films were prepared with the solution of gelatin (14% w/v) mixed with
HA or HA-tyr (1% w/v) in 0.15 M NaCl/10 mM Tris solutions (pH = 7.4).
The gelatin solution (200 μL) at 50 °C was spin-coated
(WS-650 Mz-23NPP - Laurell) on a glass slide (diameter of 12 mm) with
the following program parameters: rotation speed = 2500 rpm, acceleration
= 1250 rpm, and spin-coating time = 2 min. Then, the films were kept
dry at 4 °C.

The gelatin film can also be obtained as a
self-standing membrane by depositing 60 μL of cellulose acetate
(1% w/v in acetone) on top of the glass slide prior to the spin-coating
process. Then, after spin-coating, the interactions between cellulose
acetate and the glass slide are so weak that the film is detached
instantaneously once immersed in water (Figure S4).

Cross-Linking of Gelatin and Gelatin/HA Films
The TGA
solution (100 μL, 10%) was incubated on gelatin and gelatin/HA
films for 30 min. An additional cross-linking step was performed for
gelatin/HA-tyr; 100 μL of the H2O2/HRP
(10:1; 0.24 mg mL–1 of HRP in PBS and 0.1 M H2O2) solution was incubated on the films for 30
min. After each step, the films were rinsed twice with PBS.

Hydrogel/Film
Composite Preparation
A 6% w/v solution
of gelatin type A was prepared in MilliQ water at 37 °C. Then,
10 μL of a 20% w/v TGA solution prepared in PBS was added on
the cross-linked gelatin/HA-tyr film. The gelatin solution (50 μL)
was then deposited on top of the film and mixed with the TGA solution
to obtain homogeneous cross-linking, and the system was then put into
the incubator at 37 °C for at least 15 min.

SEM and Confocal
Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) Analysis
SEM micrograph
images were taken on an XL SIRION FEG (FEI Company
Eindhoven). CLSM observations were carried out with a Zeiss LSM 710
microscope. To visualize the film and estimate the thickness, the
PLLRho solution was used as a fluorescence probe. Virtual
vertical sections can be visualized, hence allowing the determination
of the thickness of the film. To check HA distribution within the
film, HAFITC was used. HAFITC (0.1% w/v) was
mixed with nonlabeled HA (0.9% w/v) and gelatin (14% w/v). Then, PLLRho was incubated to visualize the film and see if the green
and red fluorescence were co-localized, resulting in homogeneous HA
distribution.

The diffusion of BSAFITC from the film
to the hydrogel was analyzed by confocal microscopy. The gelatin/HA-tyr
cross-linked film was labeled in green with BSAFITC. Then,
a gelatin hydrogel labeled in red with the PLLRho solution
was added and deposited on top of the film (cf. “Hydrogel/Film Composite Preparation” section) and the system was put into the PBS solution protected
from light at 37 °C. Confocal images were taken after few hours
at the beginning and then every day to see the diffusion of BSAFITC from the film to the hydrogel. An overlapping between
the green and red fluorescence (yellow) can be seen after few hours,
which means that BSA diffuses from the film to the hydrogel. Then,
using the software incorporated in the machine, we quantified the
green fluorescence in the hydrogel and normalized it with the area
of the hydrogel to obtain the diffusion profile of BSAFITC.

Degradation Test of Gelatin and Gelatin/HA Films
Degradation
tests of gelatin and gelatin/HA films were performed at 37 °C
for 3 days by putting films in PBS (2 mL). These films were analyzed
using the “Sirius Red/Fast Green Collagen Staining Kit”
provided by Chondrex to determine the amounts of collagen and noncollagenous
proteins in the sample. The protocol was carried out as described
in the kit. These results were compared with those obtained with nondegraded
dry gelatin or gelatin/HA films.

Loading of VEGF and IL-4
in Gelatin/HA-Tyr Film
The
VEGF (50 μL, [100 μg mL–1]) and IL-4
(50 μL, [10 μg mL–1]) solutions, both
prepared in MilliQ water, were incubated for 12 h at 4 °C on
top of each film. Then, the films were put in contact with PBS for
release experiments or were kept dry in a sterile environment for
cell culture experiments (2D or 3D).

Release Kinetics of VEGF
and IL-4 from the Films and Quantification
of Cytokines in the Supernatant
For the release experiment
of both VEGF and IL-4, the fresh buffer solution (1 mL) was added
after each record and then supernatants were kept at −80 °C
prior to analysis. The levels of cytokines were measured with ELISA
Development Kits (VEGF, IL-4, IL1-RA, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, CCL18,
PeproTech). Standard curves were constructed with the included standard
protein in phosphate buffer. Samples were analyzed according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The absorbance was measured at 450
nm with SpectraMax Paradigm.

Measurements of Elastic Modulus by AFM Nanoindentation
AFM experiments were carried out using a MFP3D-BIO instrument (Asylum
Research Technology, Atomic Force F & E GmbH, Germany). The nanoindentation
method provides Young’s modulus calculated from the force versus
indentation curve. Triangular cantilevers with colloidal probes (borosilicate
glass sphere with a radius of 5 μm) were purchased from Novascan
(Novascan Technologies, Inc., Iowa State University Research Park,
IA). The spring constants of the cantilevers measured using a thermal
noise method were found to be 60 pN nm–1. Experiments
were performed in PBS buffer (pH = 7.4) at room temperature. Elasticity
maps and the corresponding histograms (statistic distribution) were
estimated from the analysis of the approach curves according to the
Dimitradis model24  where δ is the indentation depth, ν
is the Poisson coefficient, R is the colloid radius,
and h is the sample thickness. The Dimitriadis correction
for finite thickness is defined by the χ parameter  All of the force volume images were analyzed
by means of an automatic Matlab algorithm described elsewhere.25

Cell Culture Experiments
Two-Dimensional
Cell Experiments (Culture on Top of the Film)
For cell experiments
in 2D (cells seeded on top of the film), the
studies were performed with HUVECs (Promocell) and THP-1 cells (human
monocytic cell line; ATCC).

The HUVEC cells were used at passages
between 4 and 8. The culture media used were endothelial cell growth
medium (Promocell) supplemented with Supplement Mix C-39215. Cells,
in a 75 cm2 flask, were first cultivated to a near-confluent
state and then they were trypsinized and counted prior to experiment.
The THP-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 GlutaMAX (Gibco Life Technologies)
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin,
0.2% fungizone, and 0.05 nM 2-mercaptoethanol.

Gelatin and gelatin/HA
films were UV-treated for 15 min. For each
cell experiment, 50 000 cells were deposited on top of the
films, the system was first put at 37 °C for 15 min for adhesion,
and after that the medium was added.
The plate was then put into the incubator at 37 °C.

Three-Dimensional
Cell Experiments/Hydrogel Preparation for
Cell Encapsulation
For cell experiments in 3D (cells encapsulated
in gelatin type-A hydrogels), the main work was performed with HUVECs
and THP-1 cells. Prior to encapsulation, the cells (HUVECs and THP-1)
were prepared according to the protocol described before (cf. “Two-Dimensional Cell Experiments (Culture on Top of
the Film)” section).

For cell encapsulation in
the hydrogels, the gelatin type-A solution was prepared in the cell
culture medium. All of the solutions, gelatin, and TGA were filtered
prior to use (0.22 μm). The cells were then trypsinized and
centrifuged to obtain cell pellets. Then, the gelatin type-A solution
was added to obtain a cell density of 2 × 106 cells
mL–1 of the solution and kept in water bath at slightly
above 37 °C. Then, 10 μL of TGA solution was added on each
cross-linked gelatin/HA-tyr film (loaded or not with either VEGF or
IL-4). The gelatin solution (50 μL) with encapsulated cells
(100 000 cells/hydrogel) was then deposited on top of each
film and mixed with the TGA solution to obtain homogeneous cross-linking
and the film/hydrogel composite was then put into the incubator at
37 °C for at least 15 min prior to adding the cell culture medium
in each well.

Biological Analyses
To check the
metabolic activity
of the cells cultivated on gelatin or gelatin/HA films, an in vitro
toxicology assay kit, for a resazurin-based
test (Sigma-Aldrich), was used. The protocol was carried out as described
in the kit. For all immunofluorescent stainings, the cells were first
fixed with a 3.7% (v/v) solution of paraformaldehyde (PFA) in PBS.

Calcein (Life Technologies) staining was used as a viable cell
marker. After 3 days of experiment, the films (gelatin and gelatin/HA)
with HUVECs were rinsed two times with PBS. Then, a solution of calcein-AM
(5 μL for 100 μL of medium) was prepared and 150 μL
of this solution was incubated on each film for 30 min at 37 °C.
Finally, the cells were fixed with PFA. The pictures of the cells
labeled with calcein dye were taken using a confocal microscope and
were analyzed using Image J software.26

The apoptotic/necrotic/healthy cells detection kit (Promokine)
was used to quantify the apoptotic (green fluorescence for FITC-Annexin),
necrotic (red fluorescence for ethidium homodimer III), and healthy
(blue fluorescence for Hoechst) cells with a fluorescent microscope.

To quantify the NO level via the detection of nitrite in the supernatant
in 3D cell experiments with HUVECs, nitric oxide assay kit PK 210737
from Promokine was used and the test was performed according to provider’s
instruction. After the experiments, the samples were kept at −80
°C prior to analysis.

For HUVECs, the cells were then incubated
in a Triton X-solution
(0.1% in PBS) for 5 min. Then, two rinsing steps with PBS were performed
and the samples were incubated for 20 min with the BSA solution (1%
v/v) in PBS. DAPI/phalloidin/PECAM-1 (CD31) immunofluorescent stainings
were performed. After fixation with PFA and incubation with Triton
and BSA solution, the samples were incubated for 90 min with primary
antibody PECAM-1 (CD31) (Mab mouse anti-human [0.938 mg mL–1]; Thermo Scientific) at a dilution of 1/150 in PBS. Then, the samples
were incubated for 30 min with secondary antibody (Goat anti-mouse
IgG, Oregon green 488 conjugate [2 mg mL–1]; Thermo
Scientific) at a dilution of 1/200 in PBS and two rinsing steps with
PBS were performed. After that, the samples were incubated for 1 h
with phalloidin (Alexa Fluor 568 phalloidin [6.6 μM]; Molecular
Probes Life Technologies) at a dilution of 1/40 in the BSA solution
(1% v/v in PBS) and two rinsing steps in PBS were performed.

For THP-1, after fixation with PFA, the cells were washed twice
with the Tween 20 solution (0.2% in PBS) for 5 min. The samples were
incubated for 30 min with the BSA (3% v/v) and glycine (1%) solution
in PBS. Then, two rising steps with 5% goat serum in PBS for 5 min
each were performed. The samples were incubated with diluted primary
antibodies and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The primary
antibodies were (i) mouse anti-human CD80 primary Ab (Thermo scientific)
at a dilution of 1/200 in 5% (v/v) goat serum in PBS and (ii) rabbit
anti-human CD206 primary Ab (Abcam) at a dilution of 1/176 in 5% (v/v)
goat serum in PBS (final concentration = 1 μg mL–1). The samples were rinsed 3 times with 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min.
The diluted secondary antibodies were incubated at room temperature
for 1 h in the dark. The secondary antibodies were (i) Alexa Fluor-568
goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L) (Thermo scientific) for mouse anti-CD80
primary antibody at a dilution of 1/250 in 5% (v/v) goat serum in
PBS (final concentration = 8 μg mL–1) and
(ii) Alexa Fluor-488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) (Thermo scientific)
for Rabbit anti-CD206 primary antibody, 2 drops mL–1 of solution (in 5% v/v goat serum in PBS). The samples were rinsed
three times with 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min each time. Finally, the nuclei
were labeled with DAPI (1 mg mL–1; Promokine) at
a dilution of 1/100 in PBS and two rinsing steps were performed.

Real-time reverse transcription qPCR (real-time RT-qPCR) was used
for quantifying biologically relevant changes in the mRNA levels of
THP-1-encapsulated cells. The expression levels of CD86, TNF, STAT1,
CD163L1, IL10, and IL1RA were measured by real-time qPCR using 96-well
Prime PCR custom plates (BIORAD). Reactions were carried out for 50
cycles in a CFX-Connect (BIORAD). GAPDH was used as a reference gene
for all of the RT-qPCR obtained results.
