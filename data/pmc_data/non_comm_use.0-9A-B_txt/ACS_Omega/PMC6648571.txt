The comparison between
nanoparticle morphologies of the J-aggregates
of different meso-4-sulfonatophenylporphyrins showing
non-sulfonato groups at some of the meso-positions
constitutes an ultimate proof of the 2D crystal-like character of
the basic self-assembly motif of this family of J-aggregates. Diastereoisomerism
stemming from the tacticity of the relative configurations in relation
to the J-aggregate bidimensional sheet is the key factor that determines
both the striking monolayer in solution and also the hierarchical
pathways leading to different nanoparticle morphologies upon further
growth. The unexpected stability of such large monolayered sheets
made up of porphyrin units is probably caused by the support originated
at both surface faces by the double layer potentials of the peripheral
ionic substituents. These double layer potentials play a driving role
in the subsequent 3D growth of the monolayers, as deduced herein from
the determining role of tacticity both in the stability of the J-aggregate
sheet and in its evolution either to monolayered or to bilayered nanoparticles.
The stabilizing role of the forces at the electrical double layer
of the particle suggests a relationship between these forces and the
previously reported detection of racemic biases when shear hydrodynamic
forces are in action during the aggregation process.

Introduction
Amphiphilic porphyrin
J-aggregates have a wide range of potential
applications (e.g., refs1−3). However, there is still a lack
of knowledge about the self-assembly pathways of the hierarchical
aggregation process that determine the inner structure of these aggregates
and their nanoparticle morphology4−7 and, consequently, about the experimental
conditions leading to homogeneous nanoparticle samples. Recent reports
on the competing interactions in the self-assembly of these type of
compounds show the complexity of such a hierarchical self-assembly.8−10

The case of the meso-substituted 4-sulfonatophenyl-and-aryl-substituted
porphyrins leading to J-aggregates, when the inner core of the porphyrin
ring is diprotonated, is now a paradigm of hierarchical self-assembly.
On the basis of the previous reports (e.g., refs7−10), we distinguish between two phases of the aggregation process:
(a) the initial self-assembly yielding a 2D ionic polymer of quite
a specific structure and; (b) the evolution of this secondary structure
to nanoparticles of diverse morphologies.

In respect to (a),
all experimental evidence suggest that self-assembly
polymerization is a process showing similarities to that of crystal
nucleation; to an initial endergonic isodesmic polymerization, a cooperative
polymerization follows once a critical size cluster has been reached,
changing the growth dynamics to an exergonic one.11 Diffraction data of the J-aggregates of achiral H2TPPS42– (Scheme 2) show that the self-assembled structure
is a chiral sheet of an ionic polymer formed by the edge-to-edge and
face-to-face interactions of the amphiphilic monomeric zwitterions,
stabilized by hydrogen bonding interactions and by hydrophobic effects
(Scheme 1).12 This sheet is formed by pairs of conformationally
racemic dimers showing an alternate twist along the vertical axis
(y, Scheme 1) and a distortion out of the x,y-plane, which, on the whole, leads to an intrinsically chiral structure
(P21). As most often occurs in many supramolecular
self-assembly structures, this initial 2D crystallization-like process
cannot progress to the formation of crystal 3D structures, that is,
further grow along the axis z of Scheme 1. J-aggregates of derivatives
of all substituted 4-sulfonatophenylporphyrins reported herein show
similar electronic spectra than those of H2TPPS42– J-aggregates.7,12 This suggests
a common fundamental self-assembly structure for all the J-aggregates
of this family of diprotonated amphiphilic porphyrins. However, when
one of the mesosubstituents is not a 4-sulfonatophenyl group, then
diastereoisomerism becomes possible because of the tacticity of substituents
at both sheet sides (see Scheme 2).

Sheet of H2TPPS42– J Aggregates
(One Enantiomorph Represented)
The
different colors of the porphyrin
units, symbolized here as parallelepipedes, indicate two conformational
enantiomers of the porphyrin monomer. This basic sheet structure evolves
toward mono- or multilayers nanoparticles of different shapes.7,11 Adapted with permission from ref (12).

Porphyrins Discussed in This Work and on the Diastereoisomerism Arising
from the Relative configuration of the Out-of-Plane 10- and 20-Meso
Substituents of the J-Aggregate Primordial Sheet
In respect to (b), the sheet structure may evolve
toward nanoparticles
of different shapes, for example, single-walled nanotubes or plates
of different morphologies composed by mono-, bi-, or multilayers of
the fundamental structure. This evolution depends on the preparation
method of the particles and on the peripheral substitution pattern
of the monomeric diprotonated porphyrin. Curvature changes of the
primary planar sheet obviously will occur according to its elasticity,7 but note that the forces leading to the curvature
effects belong to those originated by the diffuse electric-double
layer (EDL) potentials of the surface, that is, to the topics relating
EDL to the transition of micelles to spheres and cylinders and to
the stability of charged membranes.13−15

Here, we present
experimental evidence showing how the comparison
between the H2TPPS42– J-aggregate
nanoparticles and those of other members of the homologous family
(Scheme 2) gives a
new insight on the origin of the stability of such a monomolecular-thick
chiral sheet. The diastereomeric disorder generated by a structurally
different meso-substituent group has not only influence on its stability
but also on the structure and the topology of the particles upon further
growth and evolution of the 2D-sheet monolayer.

Results
Solutions
of J-aggregates of the diprotonated porphyrins free of
metallic cations were prepared according to previous reports (Experimental Section). The presence of metallic
countercations, for example, sodium ions, leads to the formation of
inorganic salt crystallites which, besides the formation of nanoparticle
clumps, hinder the use of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) methods.7,16 For the preparation of the J-aggregate solutions, we used the Balaban
method of capillary injection of a concentrated mother solution of
the zwitterionic porphyrin into water.7 In the case of diluted solutions, the acidity generated by the zwitterionic
porphyrin is too low for the full diprotonation of the porphyrin monomers:
this drawback was conveniently avoided using previously acidified
water (HCl, pH ≈ 2 for the experiments described herein). Such
an experimental procedure for H2TPPS42– leads exclusively to single-walled nanotubes. This turned out to
be also the best method to prepare long-shaped nanoparticles of the
rest of J-aggregates of the series. In order to obtain particles of
different morphologies, the simple careful dropping of aliquots of
the porphyrin mother solution into either stirred or unstirred acidic
water was the method of choice.

H2TPPS42– J-aggregates
were compared to those of meso-tris(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrins
bearing as a fourth meso-substituent a neutral or a positively charged
group (Scheme 2). As
it can be inferred from many previous reports (e.g., refs4,17−20), the structure of the particle is not only determined by the electrostatic
forces between sulfonato anions and the diprotonated porphyrin ring,
which by themselves are isotropic, that is, of a nondirectional character,
but by hydrogen bonding, charge–dipole, dipole–dipole,
and π stacking which are of anisotropic character.

Anionic Sulfonato
Groups at Both Sides of the Sheet Surface
H2TPPS42–: the aggregation
of this porphyrin easily leads to single-walled nanotubes,7,21,22 which show diameters in the range
of ≈30 nm (see the Supporting Information). Bilayered nanoribbons are observed by SPM methods as a consequence
of the nanotube collapse when the lumen squeezes when the solutions
are casted on solid surfaces.7 However,
the preparation of the J-aggregate sample by a different method to
that of the capillary injection described above can lead to bilayered
nanoparticles whose dimensions, depending on the experimental procedure,
are either too small or too large to achieve the required curvature
of the nanotube cylinder.

The easy formation of nanotubes indicates
a different behavior of the membranes composed of planar amphiphilic
porphyrinic building blocks, showing multiple polar sites, to those
of classical linear amphiphiles. Charged membranes of classical amphiphiles
with identical ELDs at both membrane sides should be planar at the
equilibrium.13 It has been reported that
charged micelles of linear amphiphiles evolve to vesicles placing
the ionic charges at the convex side.23 Note that in the case of H2TPPS42– J-aggregates, both the convex and the concave side of the nanotubes
show the same charge composition so that, on this basis, no deflection
from planarity should be expected.

The curvature change from
the planar sheet to a nanotube cylinder
is determined by the free energy differences originated in the bending
of the sheet. In this respect, the bending modulus along the x and y (see Scheme 1) axes must be different. Recent results
using optical polarization spectroscopy show that the circumference
of the diameter section of the nanotube corresponds to the x axis, that is, to the direction of J-aggregation.24 Note that it is reasonable to expect higher
free energy changes by the loss of the optimal geometry (curvature)
of the π-stacking (y axis) (H-aggregation exciton)
than that along the J-aggregation exciton direction (x axis).

Anionic Sulfonato Groups and Noncharged Substituents at the
Sheet Surface
H2TPHPS3–: acidic solutions of this porphyrin, even those at the mM range,
show only the UV/vis absorption spectra of the diprotonated monomer
(Figure 1). Partial
formation of the J-aggregate could only be detected in solid films
obtained by casting (Supporting Information). This negative result is significant in respect to discerning the
origin of the effects that stabilize the J-aggregate sheet. In this
respect, it is significant that the lack of aryl substituents at both
sheet sides of the sheet (i.e., in the case of H2DPH2S2) still allows the formation of J-aggregates,
although without a defined geometry as indicated by the broad absorption
bands of the UV/vis spectrum (Figure 1):25,26 the absence of the effects generated
by the peripheral aryl substituents at C10 and C20 reveals the isotropic,
or of low directional character, of the electrostatic interaction
between the diprotonated core and the anionic sulfonato groups. Furthermore,
at high values of the ionic strength (0.3 M NaCl), the solutions of
H2TPHS3– show a very weak
but narrow J-aggregate absorption band (Supporting Information), pointing to a J-aggregate of low stability but
with a well-defined geometry. This indicates that, in order for the
J-aggregate to be stable, the forces originated at ELDs should be
similar at both sides of the sheet, and that they do contribute significantly
to obtain a specific geometry of the building blocks within the J-aggregate.

Figure 1 UV/vis
absorption spectra of H2TPHS3– (4.5 μM and 0.8 mM) and H2DPH2S2 (0.5 μM and 0.9 mM) J-aggregates UV/vis
(mm cuvettes path length 1 cm and 0.01). At the μM concentration
range (solid traces), no J-aggregates are formed. At the mM range
(dotted traces), H2TPHS3– does
not form J-aggregates, but H2DPH2S2 yields J-aggregates of ill-defined geometry (broad absorption bands).

H2TPCS3–: the carboxylate
groups of this J-aggregate, because of the pH values necessary for
their formation (monomer pKa = 4.7), are
present as neutral hydroxy carbonyl groups.

Freshly prepared
solutions (capillary injection method) are exclusively
composed by straight single-walled nanotubes (Figure 2): the lumen dimensions of the nanotubes
of H2TPPS42– and H2TPCS3– J-aggregates are of same order
than those of H2TPPS42–. However,
they evolve within a few days to wide plates mostly bilayered (i.e.,
composed of two 2D-sheets face-to-face to each other), although tri-
and tetralayered terraces could be also observed (Figure 2). These slow changes of the
morphology with time point to a kinetically controlled tacticity which
leads to single-walled nanotubes at the initial stage of the aggregation
process, which eventually self-repair to thermodynamically more stable
morphologies.

Figure 2 Cryo-TEM and SPM of H2TPCS3– J-aggregates (mica substrate). The first-formed single-walled
nanotubes
[peak force microscopy (PFM) on mica] evolve after few days toward
large plates, which do not show enough contrast to be observed by
CryoTEM, but can be observed by PFM.

With syndiotacticity or isotacticity being unlikely to emerge
in
a kinetically controlled formation of the J-aggregate, a reasonable
assumption is a first formation of nanotubes with atactic surfaces,
that is, statistically similar sheet surfaces, which evolve by ripening
to larger areas of the J-aggregates (Ostwald-like ripening), so that
they can achieve morphologies of higher stabilities. This ripening
would break the nanotube structure. The ability of the hydroxycarbonyl
groups for hydrogen bonding suggests that the isotactic configuration
would favorably lead to the formation of larger-scale structures in
which hydrogen bond interactions between the hydroxycarbonyl groups
of two adjacent layers, and perhaps also between hydroxycarbonyl and
sulfonato groups, allow the formation of multilayered particles (Scheme 3). Domains showing
isotacticity or syndiotacticity would evolve to the formation of bilayers
and multilayers.

Scheme 3 Scheme Showing How Isotacticity in H2TPCS3– J-Aggregates Yields the Adequate Geometry
for the
Formation of a Polymeric Hydrogen Bonding Interface between Two Sheets
Eventually, anionic sulfonato
groups (partial isotacticity) acting as hydrogen bond acceptors could
replace some carboxylic acid groups. Different tacticity domains would
explain the ability to form plates composed of more than two sheets
(Figure 2)

H2TPPS3–:
the capillary
injection method yields straight short single-walled nanotubes showing
wall defects. Cryo-TEM imaging shows nanotubes with voids at their
walls, even with topological changes on the cylinder curvature (Figure 3). PFM imaging recognizes
these defects when the nanotube collapsing to bilayered ribbons in
deposition on dry HOPG or mica (Figure 3) is taken into account.

Figure 3 CryoTEM and PFM imaging
of H2TPPS3– J-aggregate nanotubes
obtained by the capillary injection of the
mother porphyrin solution into a stirred acidic solution. In contrast
with the J-aggregate nanotubes of other porphyrins, their walls show
voids and defects from linear growth and even the change of the curvature.

Samples prepared by dropping an
aliquot of the porphyrin mother
solution to the HCl solution yield irregular nanotubes. Cryo-TEM shows,
in contrast with the nanotubes of the H2TPPS42– and H2TPCS3– J-aggregates,
nonstraight nanotubes, some of them of nonconstant diameter, voids
in their walls, and even forming ramified structures (Figure 4). These nanotubes, when deposited
onto the solid substrates for SPM imaging, collapse to the bizarre
bilayered helical ribbons that have been previously reported (e.g.,
ref (27)). Although
incomplete formation of nanotubes has been reported,4 their topology is different to the bizarre structures that
may be obtained in the case of H2TPPS3–. Nanoparticles, either too wide or too small to form nanotubes,
were always detected as bilayers, but never forming multilayered structures.
However, when the SPM imaging was immediately performed after the
sample preparation, some few monolayered particles could be detected,
which then disappear after a short time. All these point to the self-repairing
to the isotactic configuration driven by the formation of an interface
between two monolayers.

Figure 4 CryoTEM imaging of H2TPPS3– J-aggregate nanotubes obtained by dropping a
porphyrin mother solution
into the acidic HCl solution (the black drops correspond to the initial
phase of the transformation of vitrified water to crystallized water).
The defects observed in the case of the capillary injection preparation
method (Figure 3) are
now enhanced yielding arborescent structures of irregular single-walled
nanotubes. By SPM these samples show, after their deposition on dry
substrates, a collapse (ref (7)) to the characteristic helical bundles of ribbons previously
reported (e.g., ref (27)).

H2TPF5S3–: only monolayered
particles were detected for this J-aggregate. However, as previously
reported,28 different nanoparticles can
show slight differences in their thickness (1.80–2.45 nm) depending
on the preparation method. Such a difference of thickness again points
to different tacticities. The lack of bilayered particles, in contrast
with H2TPPS3– J-aggregates,
may be attributed to a lower water exclusion effect of the pentafluorophenyl
groups than that of the phenyl ones. Note that the interaction between
the pentafluorophenyl substituents of two monolayers cannot be, by
sterical reasons, the optimal π-stacking for the pentafluorophenyl
substituents because it corresponds to an overlapping between two
F–Csp2 groups or between one F–Csp2 group and the pentafluorophenyl ring. However,
in the case of H2TPPS3– J-aggregates,
the interlayer interaction between lateral phenyl substituents is
between the H–Csp2 group and the phenyl
substituent. Such an interpenetration between lateral groups at the
interface should result in a higher water exclusion effect for H2TPPS3– than for H2TPF5S3–.

The capillary
injection method allows the preparation of wide plates,
which when observed by cryo-TEM show the expected sheet structure
(Figure 5). The sheets
show small curvatures from planarity but a shape change from convex
to concave at the middle of their surface. Note that the principal
contribution to the visualization by CryoTEM of the J-aggregate nanoparticles
is that of the electron scattering of their sulfur atoms, which are
the heaviest of their chemical composition.7 Furthermore, in the case of nanotubes, electron scattering effects
enhance the contrast. Even electron diffraction structural evaluations
have been reported.29 The observation of
simple sheets in the case of H2TPF5S3– must be attributed to the substitution of some
H atoms by F atoms.

Figure 5 CryoTEM images of monolayer sheets of H2TPF5S3– J-aggregates. Their thickness,
measured
by PFM, agrees with monolayers of slightly different thickness as
expected for different tacticities.

Anionic Sulfonato Groups and Cationic Substituents at the Sheet
Surface
A characteristic of the family of 4-sulfonatophenyl-substituted
porphyrin J-aggregates is the detection of CD signals because of the
presence of small biases from the racemic composition (see, e.g.,
ref (25)). Such racemic
biases are the signature of a spontaneous mirror symmetry breaking
(SMSB) of the self-assembly process as a whole at the bifurcation
from achiral building blocks to a scalemic mixture of chiral supramolecular
structures: SMSB processes are extremely sensitive to chiral polarizations
and dramatic experimental examples of this sensitivity have been reported.30−33 Notice that any first enantiomeric excess, obtained at the primary
“nucleation” stage, such as the one occurring in crystallization,34 is simply transferred, but not amplified, during
the growth stage. However, in the direct preparation of H2TPPNHS3 and H2TPPyS3 J-aggregates,
no CD signals could be detected in any case. This absence of CD signals
can be attributed either to the formation of a real racemic composition
of chiral supramolecular structures or because the secondary structure
of these two J-aggregates is itself achiral. Notice that the sheet
structure could belong to a monoclinic space group of higher symmetry,
that is, achiral, than that of P21.

H2TPNS3– and H2TPNHS3: these J-aggregates are interconverted by changing
the solution pH value and their interconversion can be followed by
the changes of the absorption spectra, as well by their nanoparticle
morphology.35 This can be observed because
of the lower pKa values of the aminophenyl
derivative (pKa = 2.8) in respect to the
diprotonation of the porphyrin ring (pKa = 5.1). In the case of H2TPNS3–, the nanoparticle morphology observed by PFM is in accordance with
bilayered folded irregular ribbons; however, cryoTEM was not able
to distinguish whether or not they have a nanotube morphology in the
solution pH values leading to the ammonium derivative H2TPNHS3 generate a J-aggregate with flocculation-like crystallite
particles. This behavior suggests a strong ionic interaction between
different sheets of the peripheral anionic sulfonato groups and the
cationic ammonium ones.

H2TPPyS3: this
porphyrin shows the protonation
of the pyridine substituent to a pyridinium cation (pKa = 5.4) before the diprotonation of the porphyrin ring
takes place (pKa = 3.9). Therefore, H2TPPyS3 J-aggregates always bear the positively
charged pyridinium group. It is surely significant that the absorption
spectra of H2TPPyS3 J-aggregates show absorption
peaks, manifested as shoulders (460–480 nm: see Figure 6), below the limit of the red
shift of the maximal coherent length of the J-excitonic band. This
points to the presence of shorter sheet lengths along the x axis.16

Figure 6 UV/vis absorption spectra
of H2TPPyS3 (≈1
mM: cuvette path length = 0.01 mm) J-aggregates showing strongly shifted
H- and J-aggregate excitonic bands (410 and 501 nm respectively compared
to the B-band of the diprotonated monomer 437). The presence of bands
with lower red shifts (shoulders at 467 and 488 nm) indicates the
presence of shorter sheets along the x axis (see Scheme 1).

Despite the fact
that morphologies such as those of the H2TPNHS3 J-aggregates could be expected, the nanoparticle
morphology for H2TPPyS3 J-aggregates is that
of bilayered plates (≈3.9 nm). However, some of the nanoparticles
show thicknesses that agree with the deposition of monomeric porphyrin
units on the top of the bilayer (≈3.9 + 0.9 nm: see Figure 7). This  deposition,
as well as the formation of the bilayers, is originated  by the
electrostatic interaction between the cationic pyridinium groups and
anionic sulfonates at the sheet surface. Such deposition is clearly
different to the commonly observed when a monomer deposites on the
graphite surface (HOPG): the diprotonated monomer mostly present
in some proporting in J-aggregate solutions, deposites planar (thickness
≈ 0.8–0.9 nm) upon HOPG. It is also different to the
deposition of small J-aggregate particles on the top of bigger ones
as observed in the case of mica substrates,7 that in our opinion may lead to misunderstandings on the discussion
of SPM results.

(HOPG).
The relatively small nanoplates are all bilayered, but some of them
show that monomeric porphyrin deposit on the top of the plate.

Discussion
The
fundamental structure of these nanoparticles arising from the
self-assembly is a 2D crystal that shows a low exchange rate of unitary
building blocks with the solution. This exchange rate is similar to
that of a crystal in its saturated solution, where exchange takes
place at the crystal surface. However, in such a 2D crystal-like structure,
the building block exchange would occur at the edges of the structure,
that is, at the x or y axes (see Scheme 1) boundary of the
sheet with the solution, but not along the z axis.
In this respect, it is worth noting that a recent report relates the
lack of relaxation rates of the primordial self-assembly structures
with the increase in freedom degrees forming diverse nanoparticle
morphologies.8,36

Despite the absence of
the degree of stability of the J-aggregate
sheet structure that would imply a further progression to a 3D crystal-like
structure of the nanoparticle along the z axis, strikingly,
the two-dimensional monolayer still shows a well-defined crystal ordering
(space group P21)12 The comparison of the effect that different meso-substituents have
at the sheet surfaces shows how the role that 3D growth has in the
stabilization of crystals in these J-aggregate 2D crystals is replaced
by the forces originated by solvent and counter ions at the EDLs at
both sheet surfaces. These forces act as building fundaments supporting
the sheet. Two identical strong EDLs contribute to the stability of
the J-aggregate monolayer in the solution. In this respect, the behavior
of H2TPPS42– with those of
H2TPHS3– and H2DPH2S2 is compared. H2TPPS42– and H2DPH2S2 show identical forces at both sheet surfaces, but in the case of
H2DPPS2 the forces, being lower to those of
its counterpart, cannot fix the sheet structure to a specific geometry
as it is the case of the rest of tested porphyrins.

The formation
of a water layer near the surface appears also as
a consequence of the EDL potential. Such a water layer is also formed
on surfaces without charged substituents. However, the results show
that the effect of such a water layer is less significant when the
meso position is unsubstituted (H2TPHS3–) than when it is occupied by a hydrophobic phenyl
group (H2TPPS3–). Similar
forces originated by ion and water movements at both sides of the
sheet, despite being the result of different types of EDL potentials
(negative, positive, or neutral surfaces) may also stabilize the sheet.
For the tested porphyrins different to H2TPPS42–, atactic relative configurations lead to statistically
configured domains of similar EDL potentials at both side surfaces.
However, in the case of H2TPHS3–, the quite different electronic and steric characteristics of a
H atom compared to a 4-sulfonatophenyl group does not drive the system
toward aggregation: only with the presence of sodium and chloride
counterions, which generate higher forces, it is possible to detect
a low concentration of J-aggregates showing a defined geometry (see
the Supporting Information) in contrast
to H2DPH2S2.

The formation
of irregular nanotubes H2TPPS3– with wall defects reveals how the possibility
to have different tacticities does not favor the nanotube formation.
Note that the nanotube diameter (20–30 nm) determines a lumen
radii much larger than the electrostatic double layer screening-length
and that this implies the presence of lumen bulk water that will free
exchange with the water solution through the open ends of the nanotube.
The change from atacticity to isotacticity would lead to different
potentials inside and outside of the nanotube and the results obtained
with H2TPCS3– would agree
with this: only atacticity (freshly prepared J-aggregates) leads to
nanotubes.

In the nanotubes, the radii of curvature of the surfaces
are large
compared to the electrostatic screening length. This suggests that
the nanotube formation may occur when the free energy differences
originated by the concave and convex curvatures are of a contrary
sign. Probably significant curvatures occur when both surfaces show
very similar EDPs: identical for H2TPPS42– and, for example, statistically similar for atactic
H2TPCS3–. H2TPF5S3– shows a tendency to build
different tacticity domains as inferred from the detection of monolayers
of different thicknesses.28 This would
not favor the appropriate curvature leading to the formation of nanotubes.

In the case that isotactic domains may lead to interactions between
surfaces, bilayered nanoparticles would arise by forming additional
interactions at the newly rearranged interface (H2TPCS3–) or water exclusion effects (H2TPPS3–). For positively and negatively
charged surfaces, (H2TPNHS3 and H2TPPyS3), the results suggest a role for electrostatic
interactions between oppositely charged isotactic or syndiotactic
domains in the formation of bilayers. In summary, the formation of
bilayers in the solution takes place if there is a free energy gain
thanks to the formation of an interface, for example, by hydrogen
bonding (H2TPPCS3–), water
exclusion effects (H2TPPS3–), or electrostatic favorable interactions (H2TPNHS3 and H2TPPyS3).

Chemical reasoning
suggests that the sheet may act as a permeable
membrane for proton exchange. This would occur between the surfaces
composed of solvated protons at the diffuse monolayer through the
NH sites of the porphyrin ring. Such a proton-transfer mechanism,
the so-called of Grotthuss’s mechanism,37 is faster than the diffusion of any other species and of
about the same order than the vibrational rates. Therefore, the sheet
geometry would not relax under an exchange this fast. Note that for
bilayered systems with a hydrophobic interface, this fast permeability
to proton exchange would not be possible.

In respect to the
chiral structure of the J-aggregate, the role
of the EDPs suggests that the twists of the porphyrin building blocks
along the axis x and y arise because
of the forces acting at both sides of the sheet which cause the transition
from metastable achiral structures to two enantiomorphs. In addition,
the formation of these J-aggregates is a process showing autocatalytic
growth (cooperative primary self-assembly similar to primary nucleation
in crystallization),11 that is, both necessary
conditions for SMSB are met.38 Previous
reports on the dramatic effects of hydrodynamic shear forces in the
deterministic selection of their chiral sign30,32,33 had confirmed this. Note how the present
results strongly suggest that fluctuations of the hydrodynamic forces
originate by the electrical double layer determining the transition
from achiral metastable sheets to stable chiral ones. This means that
each nanoparticle sheet undergoes SMSB and, in the absence of any
chiral polarization at the bifurcation point, there is a stochastic
distribution of chiral signs, that is, a racemic mixture of J-aggregate
sheets is obtained. However, owing to the dynamics of their growth,
and in the presence of an effective, however weak, chiral polarization
at the bifurcation point, a bias from the racemic composition can
be amplified to the detectable levels. Therefore, chiral shear forces
at this bifurcation point would determine the selection of the chiral
sign, such as that which has been experimentally observed.30,32,33

The comparison of the tertiary
structures of these different J-aggregates
suggests that in respect to potential applications,39,40 for example, in their use as energy and proton-transfer devices,
the J-aggregates of choice are the nanotubes obtained from H2TPPS42–.

Experimental Section
Methods
pKa values of the
monomeric water-soluble porphyrins were spectrophotometrically measured
at room temperature by monitoring the absorbance changes at a fixed
wavelength (typically at an absorption maximum of one of the species
involved in the acid–base equilibrium) in micromolar solutions
of the substance at different pH values. The pKa values were then determined using the Henderson–Hasselbalch
equation.41 All the spectra used in the
pKa determinations showed adequate isosbestic
points.

CD measurements of J-aggregate samples were performed
according to the methods previously described in order to exclude
artifactual CD signals (see, e.g., ref (20) and citations therein).

SPM methods were
routinely applied for topological assignment of
mono- and bilayered structures. For section analysis of the nanoparticles,
peak force microcopy was used preferentially to atomic force microscopy:
for instrument and experimental details, see ref (7) and citations herein.

Peak
Force Microscopy
Images were acquired on a multimode
atomic force microscope attached to a Bruker Nanoscope V electronics
unit. For these experiments, the scan-assist tapping mode was used.
For more experimental details, see ref (7) and cites therein. The solution deposition procedure
for PFM imaging on dry substrates: one drop (10 mL) of the nanoparticle
solution was brought into contact with a freshly cleaved HOPG or mica
surface for a specific time interval and the solution was then blotted
off with the tip of a sheet of filter paper. Finally, the substrate
surface was dried by blowing with a stream of N2.

Cryo-TEM
The J-aggregate H2TPPS3– solutions
were visualized by the cryo-TEM method. A thin aqueous
film was formed from the suspension by dipping and withdrawing a bare
specimen grid. Glow-discharged holey carbon grids were used. After
withdrawal from the suspension, the grid was blotted against the filter
paper, leaving thin sample films spanning the grid holes. These films
were vitrified by plunging the grid into ethane, which was kept at
its melting point by liquid nitrogen, by using a Vitrobot (FEI Company,
Eindhoven, the Netherlands), and keeping the sample before freezing
at 100% humidity. Vitrification of the thin films was initiated at
room temperature. The vitreous sample films were transferred to a
Tecnai F20 microscope (FEI Company, Eindhoven, Netherlands) by using
a Gatan cryotransfer. The images were taken at 200 kV between −170
and −175 °C and by using low-dose imaging conditions.

Preparation of the Zwitterionic Forms (Absence of Metallic Counter
Cations)
Solutions of concentrated diprotonated zwitterionic
porphyrins for sample preparation of HJ-aggregates were prepared by
passing a solution of about 3 mg of lyophilized porphyrin in 1 mL
pure water through a Dowez 50WX4: 200/400 mesh (acid form) cationic
exchange column (acid form). The eluted solution (2 mL) were used
as concentrated mother solutions (1 × 10–3 to
1 × 10–4 M).

Preparation of J-Aggregate
Samples
Samples for the
preparation of nanotubes were prepared by capillary needle injection
of the zwitterionic mother solution (250 μL) in a HCl pH = 2
acid solution; for more experimental details, see ref (7); in order to obtain nanoparticles
of different shapes also, the simple drop to drop addition of 250
μL to the acidic water solution either by stirring or waiting
for spontaneous diffusion of the solutions was used.

5-(4-Pyridyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-sulphonatophenyl)porphyrin
(TPPyS33–) was obtained by sulfonation
of 5,10,15-triphenyl-20-(4-pyridyl)-porphyrin (PyTPP),42 according to the following procedure: in a 10
mL round-bottomed flask at 0 °C, 250 mg of PyTPP was dissolved
in 4 mL of conc. H2SO4 under sonication and
magnetic stirring. An intense greenish homogeneous solution was obtained,
which was heated up to 105 °C and stirred over 6 h. It was then
left to cool under stirring overnight. The mixture was added to cold
water (50 mL) to stop the reaction, and the resulting solution was
centrifuged once it was at room temperature. While the supernatant
liquid was rejected because of its content of undesired sulfuric acid
and salts, the greenish crude obtained (precipitate) was dissolved
in a few mL of water and then neutralized with a Na2CO3 saturated solution until the greenish color turned reddish.
The crude was purified by reversed-phase chromatography (eluted with
H2O/CH3OH 1:1), and the purest salt-free fractions
were lyophilized: sample compositions were monitored by HPLC. Yield:
278 mg (74%) of purple crystals. The pKa value for porphyrin ring diprotonation is 3.9.

5,10,15-Triphenylporphyrin: In a 1 L round-bottomed
flask with
agitation, EtOH (500 mL) was placed and argon was bubbled in the solution
for 15 min. Dipyrromethane (0.5 g, 3.5 mmol),43 5-phenyldipyrromethane44 (0.78 g, 3.5
mmol), and benzaldehyde (0.7 mL, 7 mmol) were added. The reaction
mixture was stirred for 10 min under argon and 133 mL of HCl (0.27
mM) was added. The flask, shielded from light, was stirred at room
temperature for 16 h under argon. The reaction crude was extracted
with CH2Cl2 (200 mL) and the organic phase was
washed with a saturated aqueous solution of Na2CO3 (200 mL), then with water (200 mL), and dried on anhydrous MgSO4. p-Chloranil (340 mg, 1.38 mmol) was added
to this organic phase that was heating to reflux for 1 h. The final
product was purified by crystallization in acetonitrile (20 min heating
at reflux). The liquid solution was separated from the precipitate
and rotary evaporated. Purification by preparative TLC (n-hexane/ethyl acetate, 15:1) yields 46 mg (3%) of a violet solid.

5,10,15-Tris(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin
(TPHPS33–): Sufonation of 5,10,15-triphenylporphyrin
is as
follows. The starting porphyrin (7 mg, 0.013 mmol) was transferred
on a small round-bottomed flask. Then, 2 mL of H2SO4 (98%) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred for 4 h
at 80 °C. After 4 h, 1 mL of water was added to the reaction
media and the solution was neutralized with saturated NaHCO3 solution (≈80 mL). The final solution was purified through
a reverse-phase C18 column: inorganic salts were separated by water
elution and the elution with MeOH/H2O (1:1) allowed the
separation of reaction subproducts. The eluted fraction compositions
were analyzed by HPLC: red solid; 3 mg, 30% yield.

5-(4-Hydroxycarbonylphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin:
to freshly
distilled CH2Cl2 (1 L) in a three-neck round-bottomed
flask (2 L), pure N2 was bubbled for 15 min under stirring.
Then, under stirring and under N2 atmosphere, 1.910 g (18
mmol) of benzaldehyde, 984 mg (6 mmol) of methyl 4-formylbenzoate,
and 1.612 g (24 mmol) of pyrrole were added. After that, 0.25 mL (2
mmol) of BF3 in ether solution was added. The flask was
protected from direct light and kept under nitrogen atmosphere. Some
minutes after the BF3 addition, the reaction mixture changed
from colorless to orange; 15 min later, the dark solution was further
stirred (2 h). Then, 3.7 g (15 mmol) of p-chloranil
was added and the reaction was left stirring for another 20 h. The
solution was evaporated under reduced pressure to a final volume of
200 mL. Vacuum filtration through silica removes linear pyrrole pigments
and other polar components. The final reaction crude was purified
by flash chromatography (CH2Cl2/hexane (3:2)
and dry loading). TLC of the crude showed the presence of many spots,
later identified as TPP, TPC, TPC2O, and TPC2A. TPPC was dissolved in MeOH (HPLC quality), neutralized with Na2CO3, and filtered. The solution was then evaporated
under reduced pressure and recrystallized dissolved in the minimum
amount of MeOH (HPLC quality) at 80 °C. The crystalline solid
was separated and dried over P2O5 to yield a
purple solid: 550 mg (0.835 mmol), 14% yield.

TLC (CH2Cl2/hexane 4:1, Rf 0.55) showed a single spot with a tail because
of ester
hydrolysis (observed by bidimensional TLC) that is not an issue for
the following sulfonation purposes.

5-(4-Hydroxycarbonylphenyl)-10,15,20-tris(4-sulfonatophenyl)-porphyrin
(TPCS33–). Sulfuric acid (50 mL, 98%)
was slowly added to 550 mg of 5-(4-hydroxycarbonylphenyl)-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin
in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask equipped with a Dimroth condenser.
The reaction mixture was heated to 100 °C and stirred. After
24 h, 10 mL of ice/water was added to the reaction mixture. The solution
was centrifuged and the supernatant separated and recentrifuged. The
porphyrin precipitates were collected together and neutralized to
pH 7 with a saturated solution of Na2CO3. Extractions
with CH2Cl2 eliminated traces of unsulfonated
porphyrin. The aqueous solution containing inorganic salts and sulfonated
porphyrins was evaporated under reduced pressure. The resulting crude
was refluxed with MeOH, filtrated, and then rotatory evaporated. The
final evaporation residue was eluted through a reverse-phase C18 column
using MeOH/water (50:50) as a starting eluent, and decreasing polarity
until MeOH 100%. The purity of the porphyrin fractions was monitored
by HPLC: reaction byproducts were detected before (unknown compound)
and after (meta-sulfonated product) the TPCS33– peak. This procedure proved to be ineffective in order to fully
separate TPPS3C from the metasulfonated derivative. However, the MCI
GEL CHP20P column using water as eluent was effective when the TPPS3C
crude contained small amounts of polar and metasulfonated byproducts:
the TPCS33– was retained into the column
under water elution, it was eluted with MeOH/water (1:4), and the
meta-sulfonated derivative was extracted from the column with MeOH
100%. The salt-free TPCS33– (purity 95%)
was lyophilized yielding 50 mg (5.07 × 10–2 mmol), yield 6%, of Na4TPPS3C 95%.
