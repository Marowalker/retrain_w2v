Low-molecular weight gelators (supramolecular,
or simply molecular
gels) are highly important molecular frameworks because of their potential
application in drug delivery, catalysis, pollutant removal, sensing
materials, and so forth. Herein, a small dipeptide composed of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine and O-benzyl-l-tyrosine methyl ester
was synthesized, and its gelation ability was investigated in different
solvent systems. It was found that the dipeptide was unable to form
gel with a single solvent, but a mixture of solvent systems was found
to be suitable for the gelation of this dipeptide. Interestingly,
water was found to be essential for gelation with the polar protic
solvent, and long-chain hydrocarbon units such as, petroleum ether,
kerosene, and diesel, were important for gelation with aromatic solvents.
The structural insights of these gels were characterized by field-emission
scanning electronic microscopy, atomic force microscopy, Fourier transform
infrared analysis, and X-ray diffraction studies, and their mechanical
strengths were characterized by rheological experiments. Both of the
gels obtained from these two solvent systems were thermoreversible
in nature, and these translucent gels had potential application for
the treatment of waste water. The gel obtained from dipeptides with
methanol–water was used to remove toxic dyes (crystal violet,
Eriochrome Black T, and rhodamine B) from water. Furthermore, the gel obtained from dipeptide with assistance from toluene–petroleum
ether was used as a phase-selective gelator for oil-spill recovery.

Introduction
The peptide and amino
acid-derived supramolecular gels are currently
an important class of materials which have attracted significant interest
because of their potential applications in advance material science,
pharmaceutical preparation, drug delivery, oil-spill recovery, and
as environmental pollutant-removing agents.1−14 Gels can be defined as soft materials in which solvent molecules
self-assemble into one-dimensional structure that entraps and cross
links to constitute a network.15−17 This has the ability to immobilize
a particular solvent. In other words, gels are formed under suitable
conditions where solvent molecules are trapped into a three-dimensional
architecture.18−20 Most of the gels are polymeric materials and hyper-branched
dendritic molecules. However, low-molecular weight gels or supramolecular
gels are another fascinating class of materials because of their unique
applications.21−23 These gelator molecules were formed via various noncovalent
interactions such as-hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, π–π
stacking, dipole–dipole, charge-transfer coordination interactions,
and solvophobic effects.24−33 Among the abovementioned interactions, hydrogen bonding and/or π–π
interactions are responsible for their gelatinous nature. In recent
era, low-molecular weight gelators in organic and aqueous solvents
were explored, having ample applications in nanomedicine, catalysis,
light-harvesting, tissue engineering, sensing, templating, and nanoelectronics.21−23

With the development and industrialization of human civilization,
there has been acute shortage of clean and hygienic water throughout
the world.34,35 The degradation and contamination
of water by harmful chemicals has made our natural resources (rivers,
lakes, oceans, etc.) a great threat to us.34,36 Nowadays, water purification has become a matter of utmost importance
in contemporary environmental research. The exclusive characteristics
of supramolecular gels, that is, functionalization, high aspect ratio,
and high loading capacities, make them suitable candidates for the
next-generation water purification materials.37 Everyday, the accidental or intentional dumping of crude oil and
petrochemicals into water and also contamination of toxic dyes by
chemical industries are serious environmental issue.38 The annual disposal of millions of tons of petroleum across
waterways worldwide which are also disposed in industrial waste, can
cause extensive damage to the natural ecosystem and human health.39,40 Many conventional processes such as membrane separation, ion-exchange,
chemical and electrochemical techniques, adsorption procedures, and
biological treatment are employed for removing these environmental
effluents.41,42 However, these processes have
limitation like incomplete removal, high cost, and high energy requirements.43 In this respect, the development of cheaper
and more potent methods to treat wastewater is highly beneficial and
a promising task. In an ongoing project in our laboratory, we have
observed that the benzyl-protected amino acid residue like cysteine44,45 was able to generate various self-assembled structures including
sphere, protofibril, fibril via hydrogen bonding through amide linkage,
and π–π stacking through the aromatic ring of the
substituted amino acid. In this study, we are interested to investigate
whether benzyl-substituted tyrosine would be able to generate nanomaterials
via self-assembly process. Accordingly, we designed and synthesized
two dipeptides composed N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-l-phenylalanine-O-benzyl-l-tyrosine
methyl ester and N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine-O-benzyl-l-tyrosine
methyl ester and observed that the dipeptide-containing pentafluoro
substituent can form gel in the polar protic solvent–water
mixture and as well as in the aromatic solvent-long chain hydrocarbon
(such as petroleum ether, kerosene, diesel) mixture. The morphology
of the dipeptide containing only phenyl alanine was investigated by
atomic force microscopy and found fibrils in the mixture of solvents
but this dipeptide failed to form gel in pure solvents and also in
mixture of solvents rather it formed suspension in the mixture of
solvents(see Supporting Information). We
are interested to study the behavior of the gel so further investigations
were carried out with the second dipeptide molecule. A comparison
between these two dipeptide molecules is shown in the Supporting Information. Different microscopic
techniques were used to characterize the morphology of the gelator
molecules. Molecular forces associated with the gelation of this dipeptide
were elucidated by virtue of NMR and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR)
analysis. The gel obtained from the methanol–water mixture
has the capacity to adsorb toxic dyes (crystal violet, Eriochrome
Black T, and rhodamine B) and the gel from another solvent system
can be used as the phase-selective gelator (PSG) for oil-spill recovery.
Dye absorption property of this gelator has been established by UV–vis
spectroscopy.

Results and Discussion
In the present
study, the gelation propensity of “N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine O-benzyl-L-tyrosine”
dipeptide was studied in different versatile solvent systems, including
methanol, ethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF),
acetonitrile, acetone, petroleum ether, kerosene, diesel, toluene,
xylene, benzene and water, and so forth. It was found that the dipeptide
was unable to form gel with the single solvent among the abovementioned
solvents. Because of this, a mixture of the solvent system was investigated
for gelation of this dipeptide. For the formation of the gel, water
was added to the methanolic solution of the dipeptide, a white-colored
suspension appeared, and then keeping the solution without any disturbance
formed a translucent gel within few seconds. The gelation test was
carried out in a tube by tube inversion method (see Supporting Information). This gel is thermoreversible in nature
which means heating the gel gives a clear solution and leaving it
to stand (slow cooling) for few minute gives a translucent gel. The
minimum gelation concentration (MGC) of the dipeptide in the 50% methanol–water
system was 0.25% w/v, and the calculated Tgel of the corresponding MGC was found to be 72 °C. It was observed
that gelation appeared immediately in the 50% methanol water system
and with increasing methanol amount, less amount of gel formation
was observed. Furthermore, this dipeptide also formed gel in assistance
with DMF–water, DMSO–water, acetonitrile–water,
and ethanol–water. Thereby, it can be concluded that water
is essential for gelation due to water-assisted hydrogen bonding,
and this was further confirmed from D2O-exchange proton
NMR study. In all cases, the gel was formed and stable for several
weeks without any noticeable change under ambient conditions. Apart
from the mixture of the polar protic solvent and water, this dipeptide
is able to form the translucent gel in the mixture of aromatic solvents
that is, toluene and nonpolar solvent like petroleum ether. The translucent
gel formed by the dipeptide in accordance with the mixture of toluene
and petroleum ether is thermoreversible in nature and stable for several
weeks at ambient temperature. The MGC of the dipeptide in the (1:20)
toluene–petroleum ether system was 0.2% w/v, and Tgel at this MGC was found to be 48 °C. The gel was
also formed when benzene and xylene were used along with petroleum
ether instead of toluene. The gel prepared from toluene and long-chain
hydrocarbon (such as-petroleum ether, kerosene and diesel) was prepared
in the absence of water. Owing to the better gelation tendency of
this dipeptide in the presence of 50% methanol–water with 0.25%
w/v MGC, this gel has been further used in water purification by removing
three different dyes. In addition, the gel from toluene–petroleum
ether was found to act as a PSG which can selectively gelate the oil
part in the oil–water mixture keeping the water part intact.
This phase-selective gelation was again investigated using kerosene
and diesel instead of petroleum ether (see Supporting Information).

Morphological Studies
FE-SEM Study
To
gain a visual insight into the morphological
study of this dipeptide, field-emission scanning electron microscopic
experiment was carried out. All the xerogels prepared from their respective
solvent system showed a highly cross-linked entangled structure at
their MGC. An intertwined fibrillar network was observed in case of
the methanol–water system (Figure 1a), where two or more fibers were linked
to each other to obtain a thicker fiber and highly cross-linked, entangled
sheets like structures were obtained in case of the toluene–petroleum
ether solvent system (Figure 1b). Such entangled fibrillar network possibly encouraged the
entrapment of large number of solvent molecules and also prevented
the free movement of solvent molecules.46

in the (a) methanol–water system and (b) toluene–petroleum
ether system.

AFM Study
To understand
the morphology of the self-assembled
structure adapted by this dipeptide in its dilute solution, atomic
force microscopic study was performed. For this reason, the dipeptide
was dissolved separately in methanol and toluene and drop-cast on
the mica film. The images were recorded under the microscope after
drying the sample. It was found that the widths of the fibers obtained
from the dipeptide dissolved separately in methanol and toluene solution
were 60–90 and 70–90 nm, respectively (Figure 2a,b). Therefore, it can be
concluded that this dipeptide generates dispersed fibrils from dilute
solution (5 μM). Moreover, the AFM images of this dipeptide
were also in agreement with the cross-linked entangled structure,
accounting for further aggregation of the discrete fibrils with the
assistance of solvent molecules in the corresponding gel state. The
morphology of the dipeptide in the mixture of solvents was also investigated,
and it was found that the dipeptide also formed fibrils from dilute
solution in its respective solvent system (see Supporting Information).

dipeptide in (a) methanol
and (b) toluene.

NMR Study
Deuterated
(H/D) exchange proton NMR study
of the dipeptide provided important insights into the hydrogen-bonding47 patterns of the two amide protons in the solution
state. In the absence of D2O, two doublet peaks appeared
around δ 8.50 and 6.94 ppm for Ha and Hb, respectively because of two different chemical environments of
two amine groups. The total 9 aromatic protons arose at δ 7.40
(2H), 7.34 (2H), 7.29–7.27 (1H), 7.08 (2H), and 6.87 (2H) ppm,
respectively, for this dipeptide in the NMR spectrum (Figure 3a). After adding 10 μL
of D2O to a 10 mM dipeptide solution in DMSO-d6, the intensity of the proton arose at δ 6.94 ppm
for Hb being diminished rapidly (within 1 min) and shifted
from 6.94 to 6.90 ppm as shown in (Figure 3b). This Hb proton may be involved
in strong hydrogen bonding with DMSO. When D2O was added,
the interaction pattern of the hydrogen may be altered depending on
its position and orientations. Because of this, the Hb proton
shielded little bit.48 The intensity of
the other proton appeared at δ 8.50 ppm for Ha diminished
slowly. The D2O (H/D) exchange proton NMR spectrum was
taken after 2 and 4 h, as shown in (Figure 3c,d). From this NMR study, it can be concluded
that both the protons Ha and Hb are solvent-exposed
and participated in intermolecular H-bonding with another dipeptide
molecules and the solvent molecules.

spectra of the dipeptide after 4 h in the presence of 10 μL

FT-IR Analysis
FT-IR spectroscopy study was performed
to evaluate the molecular interactions that interplay to form gelation
of the dipeptide in different solvent systems. For recording the FT-IR
spectra of the dipeptide in its wet gel state; the gels were prepared
in their respective solvent systems at their MGC, according the procedure
given in the Results and Discussion part.
The important FT-IR band positions are marked in the Figure 4, and assignment of these bands
is placed in the Supporting Information (Table S1). The molecular interactions were influenced by the amide
backbone configuration. The amide I, amide II, and amide III bands
those were influenced by the geometry of the amide bond configuration
and hydrogen-bonding pattern appeared at 1600–1690, 1480–1580
and 1230–1300 cm–1, respectively.49,50 The amide I mode originated due to CO stretching vibration, and
the amide II and amide III associated with the coupling of C–N
stretching and N–H in-plane bending. In order to get the molecular
interactions associated with the gelation of the dipeptide, we measured
the FTIR spectra of the dipeptide in their solid and wet gel states
(Figure 4). In the
solid state of the dipeptide (Figure 4a), one sharp peak appeared at 1666 cm–1 along with a hump at 1655 cm–1, corresponding
to the amide I vibrational mode of the carbamate carbonyl and the
amide carbonyl, respectively. In addition, the sharp peak appeared
at 1740 cm–1 for the ester carbonyl in the solid
state of the dipeptide. However, for the gel state of the dipeptide
in the methanol–water solvent system (Figure 4b), the characteristics peak appeared at
1628, 1666, and 1740 cm–1 with broadening nature
compared to the solid state. This broadening of the amide peaks and
the appearance of the peak at 1628 cm–1 indicated
that in the gel state, this dipeptide becomes hydrated through the
water and methanol solvent system. The amide (−CONH) group
may be involved in hydrogen bond formation with water. Thus, the associated
water molecules contribute to the broadness at 1628 cm–1. Similarly for the gel state of this dipeptide in toluene petroleum
ether (Figure 4c),
shifting of the amide peak from 1666 to 1658 cm–1 along merged with the hump at 1655 cm–1 was observed,
suggesting strong hydrogen bonding in the gel state compared to the
solid state.

gel state prepared from the methanol–water (c) wet gel state

X-ray Diffraction Study
To determine
the solid-state
molecular arrangement and packing of dipeptide (3) at
the atomic level, powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiment was carried
out in both gel state obtained from two different solvent systems
and its solid state, as represented in Figure 5. The xerogel form showed sharp reflections
appeared in the 5–40° (2θ value) range and was therefore
inferred to be crystalline in nature. Xerogel obtained from the dipeptide
in the toluene–petroleum ether solvent system showed a peak
(Figure 5b), corresponding
to d-spacing 4.73 Å (2θ ≈ 18.7°)
accompanied by the other peak at 9.71 Å (2θ ≈ 9.1°),
which were indicative of a β-sheet-like arrangement of these
gelator molecules. The peak at 4.73 Å represented the spacing
between peptide chains within a β-sheet. Additionally, the peak
at 9.71 Å was approximately doubled the β-sheet spacing.
This may be due to either, the repeating unit of β-sheet type
hydrogen bonding or the “side-chain” spacing between
two interacting parallel sheets.51−54 Moreover, a peak at 2θ
≈ 26.29° (3.38 Å) was observed for the xerogel obtained
from the toluene–petroleum ether solvent system, indicating
the presence of π–π stacking interactions.52−54 In the case of the solid state, the broad peaks (Figure 5a) were due to the heavy scatterings,
which represented semi-crystalline characteristics of the dipeptide.
Despite the fact that the dipeptide partially lost its crystalline
property in the dry state, the low intense peaks at 2θ ≈
9.8° (9.01 Å), 18.2° (4.86 Å), and 25.3°
(3.51 Å) were still present, which indicated the presence of
β-sheet-like arrangement and π–π stacking
interaction in the dry state, although these values are slightly shifted
from the xerogel obtained from the toluene–petroleum ether
solvent system. Further, few strong intense lines are also observed
in the wet-gel state which may be due to pure phenylalanine or tyrosine
as reported earlier.55−58 Unlike the sharp reflection in the toluene–petroleum ether
solvent system, the XRD spectrum of the dipeptide in the methanol–water
solvent system (see Supporting Information) showed broad peaks which indicated that the crystalline property
of the dipeptide is less in this medium. It suggested that the xerogel
state of the dipeptide significantly depended on the polarity of the
environment. It showed peaks at 2θ ≈ 18.67° (4.74
Å) and 29.51° (3.02 Å), which may be due to β-sheet-like
arrangement and π–π stacking interactions as obtained
from the toluene–petroleum ether medium.

dipeptide in its solid state. (b) XRD patterns

Rheological Experiment
Rheological experiments were
carried out to find the mechanical strength of the gel. This experiment
was important to gain information about the flow behavior and the
rigidity of the gel. In a typical frequency, sweep experiment under
a constant (0.1%) strain was performed to monitor the storage modulus
(G′) and loss modulus (G″)
as a function of applied angular frequency. It was found that for
both gels, storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus
(G″) did not cross each other, and storage
modulus (G′) is always greater than the loss
modulus (G″) throughout the entire range of
frequency for both solvent systems (Figure 6), which is in agreement with the fact that
a soft solid-like gel-phase material was present.

Dye Adsorption Study
Toxic dyes are used by several
industries for their various purposes and often the waste dyes are
being dumped into river water.38 Nowadays,
low-molecular weight gelators are used for the removal of these toxic
dyes quite efficiently. The adsorption behavior of the gel obtained
from the methanol–water mixture was investigated by adding
aqueous solution of the dye to the gel. Surprisingly, three different
dyes, crystal violet, Eriochrome Black T, and rhodamine B, were adsorbed
rapidly over a period of time by this supramolecular adsorbent. The
concentration of the dyes used was 0.01 mM. After 24 h, more than
90% of the dyes were adsorbed for crystal violet and Eriochrome Black
T, and more than 80% dye was adsorbed for rhodamine B (Figure 7). For rhodamine B, dye adsorption
study was further investigated and found that 92% adsorption was done
after 48 h (see Supporting Information).
Adsorption of the dyes from aqueous solution was also examined by
UV–vis spectroscopy, which showed that the dye was adsorbed
by the gel leaving behind the clear water (Figure 8a–c). The morphological change of
this gelator molecule after dye adsorption may be due to the hydrogen
bonding and/or π–π stacking between the dye molecules
and the gelator molecule.

Selective Organogelation
Low-molecular weight supramolecular
gels offer a unique application through selective gelation of oil
products having molecular weight larger than their own molecular weight.
The phase-selective gelation from a given mixture of solvents becomes
more challenging if water is used as one of the solvents. This property
can be used as oil-spill remediation, so-called “bio-refinery
design”. The insoluble behavior of the organogel in water and
good gelation ability in many organic solvents make them suitable
for selective gelation of the oil in oil–water mixture. In
a typical procedure, 5 mg
compound was added to the mixture of 1 mL of the toluene–pet-ether
mixture (1:20) and 1 mL of water. The compound was then solubilized
by heating in this two-phase and shaken vigorously to make it homogeneous.
After cooling to room temperature, the organic layer was gelated,
and the water layer remained intact in its liquid state (Figure 9). This procedure
was further investigated for the toluene–kerosene and toluene–diesel
system (see Supporting Information).

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we developed a new low-molecular weight gelator
peptide consisting of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine and O-benzyl-l-tyrosine,
and its gelation ability had been investigated in different solvent
systems. The mixture of the solvent system was found to be efficient
for promoting the gelation of this dipeptide. Water is found to be
essential along with polar protic solvent systems for gelation of
this dipeptide. In addition, the long-chain hydrocarbon unit is found
to be important in assistance with aromatic solvents for gelation
of this dipeptide. Both of the gels prepared from these two solvent
systems were thermoreversible and translucent in nature. These gelator
molecules had the potential in water purification. The gel obtained
from the methanol–water solvent system was used to remove three
different toxic dyes (crystal violet, Eriochrome Black T, and rhodamine
B) from aqueous solutions, and the gel prepared from the aromatic
solvent and long-chain hydrocarbon was successfully employed as a
PSG in oil-spill recovery.

Experimental Section
All chemicals
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used without
further purification unless otherwise stated. Solvents were freshly
distilled by the standard procedures prior to use. Column chromatography
was performed on the silica gel (Merck, 60–120 mesh) with the
required eluent. Finally, compounds were characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and mass spectrometry.

Synthesis of the Dipeptide
To a well-stirred solution
of N-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)pentafluoro-l-phenylalanine(1, 1 g, 2.81 mmol) dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide (15 mL), was added anhydrous
hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBT; 455 mg 3.37 mmol) slowly followed by 1-ethyl-3,3-(dimethylamino)propyl
carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC·HCl; 1 g,5.62 mmol) in cooled
conditions under a nitrogen atmosphere. Then, stirring was continued
for 10 min at ice-cooled conditions, and to this mixture triethylamine
(TEA; 2 mL, 14.05 mmol) was added along with O-benzyl-l-tyrosine methyl ester (2, 900 mg, 2.81 mmol); subsequently,
the reaction was further continued for 8 h at room temperature (monitoring
via thin-layer chromatography). The reaction mixture was then concentrated
to dryness and extracted with ethyl acetate from the aqueous layer.
Evaporation of the solvent under reduced pressure produced the crude
product, which was further purified by column chromatography over
the silica gel (hexane/ethyl acetate) to afford the intermediate compound
“3” as the white solid (yield = 80%) (Scheme 1).

Instrumentation
NMR Experiments
1H and 13C NMR
spectroscopic data were recorded with a Bruker DPX 300 and 600 MHz
spectrometer. Chemical shifts (δ) were reported in parts per
million (ppm), and tetramethylsilane (δ = 0.00) was used as
the internal standard. All the 1H and 13C NMR
spectra of the compound were recorded in the DMSO-d6 solvent having 1H NMR, δ = 2.50 ppm
(s) and 13C NMR, δ = 40 ppm (m), and all data were
reported as follows: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity (s
= singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet, q = quartet, m = multiplet),
and coupling constant (s) in hertz (Hz). All the experiments were
performed at room temperature (25 °C).

Atomic Force Microscope
AFM images were obtained on
Pico Plus 5500 AFM (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA)
with the piezo scanner range of 9 μm. The images (256 ×
256 pixels) were captured with a scan size between 0.5 and 5 μm
at the scan speed rate of 0.5 rpm. The images were processed through
flattening via PicoView software (Molecular Imaging Inc., Ann Arbor,
MI, USA). For this purpose, dipeptide solution incubated at room temperature
for 24 h, and then the solution was applied to a mica foil, after
drying the sample solution placed at the mica foil, and the specimen
was observed through atomic force microscopy.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
The FT-IR spectra of the dipeptide
were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two spectrometer. For recording
the FT-IR in wet-gel state, the gels were prepared in their respective
solvents at their MGC. The spectra were scanned from 400 to 4000 cm–1 at 4 cm–1 resolution. Spectrum
10 software was used for data processing.

Field-Emission Scanning
Electron Microscopic Study
Morphologies of the gel materials
were investigated using field-emission
scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). For FE-SEM study, dilute solutions
of gel materials were dried, and platinum coating was carried out.
Then, the micrographs were taken in an FE-SEM apparatus (JEOL Scanning
Microscope-JSM-7600F). Another FE-SEM study of the gel after adsorption
of the dye was performed in an FE-SEM apparatus Hitachi S-4800.

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded using a JASCO V-630 spectrophotometer. A high-quality
quartz cuvette was used for measuring the absorbance.

Dye Adsorption
The maximum amount of dye adsorption
was monitored by adding 1 mL of dye (0.01 mM) to a sample tube together
with 2 mg of compound (3). This solution was left for
24 h at rt to adsorb the dye. The final concentration of the dye in
the solution was determined by UV–vis spectroscopy.

Rheology
Experiments
The rheological measurement of
the gel obtained from the toluene–petroleum ether solvent system
was performed using a modular compact rheometer (Anton Parr, MCR 102,
Austria). The instrument was equipped with an air compressor unit,
which maintained the air pressure at 7 kg/cm2. A standard
cone-plate geometry (CP-40, 40 mm outer diameter, angle 1°) was
employed in the study. Frequency sweep (G, G″ vs angular sweep) was measured in the oscillation
mode. The data were analyzed using Rheoplus software (US 200, version
3.62). Another rheology experiment of the gel obtained from the methanol–water
solvent system was performed in SDT Q Series Advanced Rheometer AR
2000.

XRD Study
XRD study of the xerogel was carried out
by placing the sample on a glass plate. Experiments were carried out
by using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker AXS, model no. D8 Advance).

Determination of Gel–Sol Transition Temperature (Tgel)
The gel-to-sol transition temperature
(Tgel) was determined by placing the organogel
containing inverted screw-capped glass vial into a thermostatted water
bath and raising the temperature at a rate of 2 °C min–1. The Tgel was defined as the temperature
(+0.5 °C) at which the gel melted and showed gravitational flow.
