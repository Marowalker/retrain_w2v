The chemical garden, which has been
known as the plant-growth-like
diffusion of chemicals since the 17th century, has regained much attention
in recent years. Significant progress in research not only promoted
the understanding of the phenomenon itself but also suggested a prospective
method of synthesizing new materials via the chemical garden route.
It is extremely important to introduce new characterization techniques
to provide more insights into chemical diffusion and element redistribution
during the reaction process. The present article describes some successful
applications of the realtime X-ray fluorescence (XRF) movie technique
to observe each diffusing element. The protagonist of the movie is
a chemical garden reaction growing from a seed of calcium salt and
ferrous salt mixtures. Through observation by an XRF movie, it has
been found that the growth rate and diffusion behavior of calcium
and iron are very different. This results in a macroscopic diversity
of the element composition in the finally precipitated chemical garden
structures. The present research not only reconfirms the potential
of fabricating gradient composites through the self-organized chemical
garden approach but also demonstrates the attractive achievements
of XRF movies. It has been demonstrated that the XRF movie is an indispensable
realtime characterization technique for the study of chemical garden
reactions or even other related diffusions.

Introduction
The chemical garden
is a famous chemical phenomenon. The reaction
is generally started by seeding a soluble metal salt crystal into
sodium silicate solution. When the crystal starts to dissolve, it
is immediately enveloped by a semipermeable membrane, which precipitates
at the interface of the internal metal salt solution and the external
silicate solution. The continuous dissolution of the metal salt increases
the osmotic pressure of internal solutions, driving external water
molecules to enter the envelope continuously through the membrane.
As the internal water pressure increases, the membrane envelope expands,
and finally it ruptures at its weakest point, ejecting a fluid of
metal salt solution into the external sodium silicate solution. Again
the fluid is immediately trapped by a new envelope which precipitates
at the interface of two solutions. This envelope precipitation–rupture
process is ceaselessly repeated, resulting in a continuous growth
of membrane tubules in the solution. Because the metal salt solution
is less dense than the sodium silicate solution, the flow direction
of the ejected fluids is generally forced upward by the influence
of buoyancy. Therefore, the direction of tubular growth is upward
as well.

The chemical garden phenomenon was first discovered
by Glauber
in 1646.1 At that time, it inspired a broad
interest in discussing the original form of life because its growth
regime and plantlike tubular shape resemble those of some organisms.
In the subsequent three centuries, its self-organized inorganic semipermeable
membrane was frequently associated with biological membranes.2,3 However, as more and more knowledge was accumulated on biology and
biochemistry, this analogy between chemical garden and organic life
was finally in decline in the mid-20th century.4 After that, except for its impressive fascinating appearance,
the scientific significance of the chemical garden did not cause much
interest until 1980.5 Since then, a great
deal of modern research on the chemical garden has been conducted
and many types of chemical garden reactions have been systematically
studied. The terminology of the chemical garden has been extended
to represent a wide range of chemical reactions, in which a semipermeable
membrane precipitates at the interface of two different aqueous solutions
and a steep transmembrane chemical gradient automatically forms.6 In this modern research, the reactants are quite
variable. The general formation mechanism of the chemical garden has
been clarified.7 Different growth regimes
have been reported,8 and an oscillation
growth model has been established.9,10 The precipitated
tubular structures have been comprehensively characterized in many
aspects, including morphology,11,12 hierarchical nanostructure,13 composition gradient,14−16 crystallography,17 porosity,18,19 magnetism,18,19 catalysis,18,19 etc. Some experiments were conducted in microgravity to discuss
fluid convection that is free of buoyancy,20,21 and some experiments were conducted in a magnetic field to influence
the ions in the fluid and to induce three-dimensional (3D) morphological
chirality.22,23 This gradual deepened understanding
of the chemical garden has certainly lead to fruitful achievements
in different fields. It has been found that the chemical garden phenomenon
also occurs in submarine vents24 and in
the process of cement hydration25 and metal
corrosion.26 It has been reported that
the chemical garden reaction could be applied to the field of nanowires,27 fuel cells,28 cytocompatible
biomaterials,29 and biomineralizations.30 In view of all of the progress that has been
made in the past 40 years, a suggestion was made in 2015 to introduce
the new terminology “chemobrionics” for representing
the entire field of modern research on the chemical garden.6 Moreover, much future research on synthesizing
new materials and fabricating new composites via the chemical garden
route can be expected.

Modern research on the chemical garden
provides much observational
detail and scientific insight compared with the early-stage naturalistic
surveys centuries ago. This is mainly due to the advent of many powerful
characterization techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy,8 transmission electron microscopy,17 energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS),8 X-ray diffraction,8 thermogravimetric analysis,14 and Raman
spectroscopy.30 However, until now, most
of these characterization techniques can only analyze the final precipitated
products of the chemical garden as the specimen, which must first
be isolated from the solution. As a result, it would be extremely
troublesome and probably sometimes unreliable to reveal the stagewise
development of precipitated tubules. Although Mach–Zehnder
interferometry7 was once used to observe
the formation of chemical gardens, the most general method is still
to observe the change in appearance by the human eye or optical microscopy.
This method can describe obvious morphological change during tubular
growth. Nevertheless, it may not be effective to study gradual chemical
diffusion and precipitation during the subsequent aging process. More
importantly, this method cannot reveal the nature of element species.
To synthesize new materials via the chemical garden route,31 there is no alternative but to introduce two
or more species of metal ions in one chemical garden reaction. Therefore,
it is necessary to record the whole process of spatiotemporal diffusion
and precipitation of different elements in the same reaction. As a
consequence, a new realtime characterization technique is needed.

Full-field X-ray fluorescence (XRF) imaging32 is a powerful technique for studying the spatial distribution
of elements in materials. In 2003, its time-resolved version, sometimes
called the XRF movie,33,34 was utilized to visualize the
chemical diffusion dominated by an ion-exchange resin. The subsequent
development of X-ray detectors35,36 endowed this technique
with spectroscopic resolvability for distinguishing different elements.
Most recently, the instrumentation in this technique has been further
simplified, making the technique much more cost-effective and serviceable.37,38 It has been proved that even with a laboratory X-ray tube one can
smoothly take a realtime XRF movie, which displays the process of
chemical redistribution in an aqueous reaction system. Therefore,
the technique is quite suitable for realtime observation of diffusing
elements in the chemical garden.

In this research, a fine mixture
of calcium salt and ferrous salt
was used as a seed for the chemical garden. Its tubular growth and
subsequent aging process were recorded by an XRF movie (Figure 1). By virtue of the movie, it has been established
that the calcium distribution differed greatly from the iron distribution
in the final precipitated tubular structures. Moreover, calcium and
iron showed quite different diffusion behaviors in the aging process
over many hours. The reason for such difference was explained.

The dimension of the cell is 30 mm (H) × 15
mm (V) × 0.5 mm (thickness).

Results and Discussion
Figure 2 shows the
photo of the final chemical garden structure after the reaction. The
scale bar is 1 mm. The arrow indicates the upward direction of the
vertically placed Hele-Shaw cell. The red-dashed rectangle indicates
the observation area of the XRF movie. The red triangular mark indicates
the initial position of the wafer seed, which dissolves and is enveloped
by a big swell during the reaction. Some plantlike tubules appear
on the base of the big swell. Their growth directions are mostly upward.
The final chemical garden structure shows different colors at different
parts. In general, the white structures appear at the upper parts
of the tubules, whereas the green structures appear at the lower parts
as well as the boundary of the big swell. Clearly, the diversity of
colors indicates the difference in chemical composition. It should
be noted that the initial wafer seed is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore,
such a macroscopic diversity of chemical composition is actually a
product of self-organization. This phenomenon is presumably due to
the difference in chemical properties of iron and calcium because
it has not been reported in previous chemical garden experiments of
pure calcium salt seed or pure ferrous salt seed. Nevertheless, it
is difficult to deduce the chemical composition at difference parts
merely from the appearance. This is the reason why the XRF movie technique
has been employed for this observation.

Figure 2 Optical microscopy photo
of the final chemical garden structure
after 15 h of reaction. The scale bar is 1 mm. The red-dashed rectangle
indicates the observation area of the XRF movie, which is approximately
7 mm (H) × 4 mm (V). Region
A indicates a typical tubular structure of white color, and region
B indicates a typical structure of green color.

A similar experiment is conducted under the observation of
optical
microscopy. The rapid tubular growth is recorded by a video (Supporting Information). The same phenomenon
is reproduced, proving that the color diversity is not induced by
X-rays. As shown in the video, the tubular growth is pioneered by
white structures, whereas the green color appears subsequently from
the lower to the upper parts.

The XRF movie provides much information
in different forms. Figure 3 shows the full-field
XRF spectra, which accumulate all detected XRF signals in 15 h. The
spectroscopic property of an XRF movie enables it to distinguish different
elements. As shown in Figure 3, the spectra peaks of calcium (Ca Kα, Ca Kβ)
and iron (Fe Kα, Fe Kβ) can be clearly identified. The
spectra peaks of calcium are much weaker than those of iron because
XRF photons of calcium have lower energy than those of iron, and consequently
they are more intensively absorbed in the solution, in air, and in
the detector window. For the same reason, other elements in the reaction
system, including hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, sodium, and chlorine,
are not shown in the spectra because their even lower energy XRF photons
are totally absorbed. Nevertheless, because the seeded metal cations
are generally of the most interest, XRF observation can still provide
much useful information even if does not show light elements.

Figure 3 Full-field
XRF spectra of the chemical garden. The XRF signals
are accumulated in the whole 15 h reaction. Spectra peaks of Ca and
Fe can be identified.

The XRF signals of calcium and iron are extracted to compose
time-resolved
XRF images of calcium and iron, respectively. Because the observation
of the XRF movie lasts for 15 h, it is acceptable to set its frame
rate as 1 frame/h to study the gradual chemical diffusion during the
long-term aging process. In this case, for each element, in total,
15 movie frames are generated and every movie frame represents the
element’s spatial distribution in this 1 h. Figure 4 displays some key movie frames,
in which the scale bar is 1 mm.

Figure 4 Sequential movie frames of Ca and Fe.
The movie indicates the gradual
diffusion of calcium and iron during the long-term aging process.
The frame rate of the movie is 1 frame/h. Regions A and B have different
element compositions. Region C is at the boundary of the big swell,
and region D is inside the swell.

The correlation between optical appearance and element composition
is clarified by comparing Figure 2 with the 15th movie frame in Figure 4. It is quite clear that the green structures
include both calcium and iron, whereas the white structures include
only calcium. Thus, it is presumably inferred that iron is the actual
color agent in the green structures. The most typical evidence is
marked by A and B in both Figures 2 and 4. At the position of A,
the XRF image of calcium does not exactly match the outline of the
white plumes in the photo. This is because XRF observation is more
sensitive to superficial structures. The gossamer white calcium membranes
located in the deeper parts of the Hele-Shaw cell cannot be clearly
imaged because calcium XRF photons are intensively absorbed in the
solution. It should be realized that the one-to-one mapping of calcium
to white and iron to green is a very fortunate case in the field of
the chemical garden. In many other cases, the correlation between
the appearance color and element composition is confusing. For example,
the precipitated membrane of iron appears green when it is ferrous-dominated
and turns brown when it is oxidized to being ferric-dominated. In
another example, cobalt appears red when its cations are dissolved
in solution, but turns blue when it is precipitated in the form of
cobalt hydroxide colloid. The correlation may become more complicated
when two or more metal cations are mixed or coprecipitated. For this
reason, it is necessary to utilize XRF imaging to reveal the reliable
spatial distribution of different elements in a chemical garden reaction.

After understanding the correlation between the appearance color
and element composition, the optical microscopy video (Supporting Information) of the chemical garden
reaction is reviewed. As shown in the video, the growth of tubules
is quite fast, whereas iron climbs up these tubules in the later stage.
This is presumably because the growth of calcium tubules is much faster
than that of iron. In 2011, it was reported that calcium chloride
has the lowest induction time and the highest linear growth rate among
four metal-ion salts of calcium chloride, manganese chloride, cobalt
chloride, and nickel sulfate. This tendency is believed to be related
to the solubility product constant of these salts in hydroxides. For
calcium hydroxide, the solubility product constant is 5 × 10–6, which is much larger than that of the other three
metal elements.8 Our experiment is consistent
with this conjecture because the solubility product constant of ferrous
hydroxide is 8 × 10–16, which is significantly
smaller than that of calcium hydroxide. This experiment proves that
the difference in growth rate remains even when the two reactant metal
salts are evenly mixed in advance. The difference in growth rate results
in a macroscopic inhomogeneous distribution of calcium and iron, which
could be subsequently fixed when the tubular growth stops for some
reason. As a result, it looks like a portion of calcium is purified
from the mixture of two elements.

The sequential movie frames
in Figure 4 show the
gradual diffusion of calcium and
iron in the long-term aging process after the tubules have been formed.
It is quite clear that iron is gradually diffused from the internal
solutions to the precipitated boundary walls of the big swell. This
phenomenon is not a surprise because hydroxyl ions are continuously
driven into the swell through the semipermeable membrane by its transmembrane
concentration gradient. As a result, more and more ferrous ions in
the internal solution are trapped and precipitated at the interior
surface of the membrane. This process leads to a composition gradient
of the membrane, which mainly contains metal hydroxides in its interior
surface. In general, the composition gradient is characterized by
EDS, and it has been widely reported in many other works.15−17,8

In contrast to iron, the
spatial distribution of calcium remains
quite stable in the aging process over many hours. This contrast could
be explained by the solubility product constant as well. As the constant
of calcium hydroxide is 10 orders of magnitude larger than that of
ferrous hydroxide, the calcium ions are far less sensitive to the
entered hydroxyl ions than the ferrous ions. Therefore, the diffusion
and precipitation behavior of calcium is obviously different from
iron and its redistribution is nearly unnoticeable. The present research
reports for the first time such a difference in a mixture-seed chemical
garden reaction, but some related clues can be found at least in one
paper published in 2011.8 In that paper,
the authors stated that the wafer seed of manganese chloride and the
wafer seed of cobalt chloride became empty or hollow at the end of
their respective chemical garden reaction, whereas this phenomenon
is not mentioned in the calcium chloride reaction. The nature of the
hollow iron shell would be almost the same with manganese and cobalt
because their solubility product constants are in the same level.
In the present research, the gradual formation process of the hollow
iron shell is directly recorded in the XRF movie. It proves that the
formation mechanism is dominated by the metal ion’s chemical
property rather than fluid convection because the big swelling shell
is still fully filled with calcium. This also would explain the reason
why calcium structures grow faster than iron structures even if these
two elements share the same tubules. During the tubular growth, when
ferrous ions are ejected or pumped upward, they are more likely to
be trapped and exhausted by the diffusing hydroxyl ions. As a result,
the tubular growth is always guided by calcium structures.

To
study how one can synthesize new composite materials via the
chemical garden route, in many cases people need to quantitatively
know the composition or concentration change at different parts in
the reaction. The XRF movie can provide such quantitative information.
It can generate plenty of time-resolved localized XRF spectra, which
reflect the element composition within a microregion in a specific
time interval. For example, in Figure 4, two regions are defined. Region C is at the boundary
of the big swell, and region D is inside the swell. Many time-resolved
XRF spectra of C and D have been collected. Some of them are displayed
in Figure S1 in Supporting Information. The localized XRF spectra taken from different
hours are clearly different, indicating the respective composition
change at C and D. It is possible to calculate the exact element concentration
by carefully analyzing the time-resolved localized XRF spectra, but
generally this requires much effort in modeling the sample matrix
and fitting the spectra. This time, the intensity of XRF peaks is
just used to represent the amount of the corresponding element. This
semiquantitative approximation is also broadly adopted in many other
XRF imaging studies. Figure 5 shows the time-dependent change of calcium intensity and
iron intensity at C and D, respectively. As shown in the figure, the
intensity of iron increases at C, which is negatively correlated to
its intensity decreasing at D. In contrast, the calcium intensity
remains quite stable for all 15 h at either C or D. This semiquantitative
analysis in Figure 5 agrees with our impression on the sequential movie frames in Figure 4.

Figure 5 XRF intensity change
of Ca and Fe at two different regions.

The XRF movie also records the rapid tubular growth at the
early
stage. To see this, the frame rate of the movie is adjusted to 1 frame/3
min. This 3 min-time-resolution movie is generated from the same database
of all detected XRF signals. Some key movie frames of iron are displayed
in Figure S2 in Supporting Information, showing the growth process of the specific tubules
containing iron. In this experiment, because the detected calcium
XRF intensity is not so strong, it is difficult to collect sufficient
statistics every 3 min to generate a clear frame of the 3 min-time-resolution
movie. However, this technical barrier is easily removed by optimizing
the X-ray movie instrument in future, mainly by increasing the incident
X-ray intensity. Thereafter, the growth rate of calcium tubules and
iron tubules can be directly compared by XRF intensity recorded in
the movie. This will be more reliable than looking at the appearance
color of tubules in an optical microscopy video. In the XRF movie
observation, if some necessary data processing parameters have been
set in advance, the XRF movie frames can be sequentially generated
parallel to the chemical garden reaction. Thus, the XRF movie observation
is a realtime observation.

In this research, the chemical garden
reaction is confined in a
quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) Hele-Shaw cell rather than in a 3D
test tube. This is convenient for X-ray observation because generally
X-rays cannot penetrate into or escape from deep parts of solutions.
This reduction in dimensionality is also adopted in some other works5,7 for ease of observation and discussion. Though most chemical garden
reactions are 3D, the observation of quasi-2D reactions can still
help to construct an approximated model to understand the universal
reaction mechanism. It should be realized that the Hele-Shaw cell
in this research is vertically placed. It does not eliminate the buoyancy
force and consequently the formed tubular structure is the same as
with general chemical garden structures. In some other works,39,40 the Hele-Shaw cell is horizontally placed and the vertical growth
of chemical garden structures is restricted; therefore, some special
spiral patterns are finally formed. It should be noted that the chemical
garden reactions discussed in this research are different from those
horizontal reactions.

Conclusions
Instead of seeding only
one species of metal salt in a chemical
garden reaction, the present research used a mixture of two metal
salts, which were calcium chloride and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate.
It was found that the upward growth of calcium structures was obviously
faster than iron structures even though these two elements shared
the same tubules in the same reaction. In addition, during the subsequent
hours-long aging process, iron diffused to the boundary of a big swell
formed around the initial seed position, forming an empty iron shell
at the end of the reaction. In contrast, calcium was homogeneously
dispersed inside the shell, with no obvious change in distribution
over time. The difference in the growth rate and diffusion behavior
could be explained by the different solubility product constants of
calcium and iron in their hydroxides. As a result, a macroscopic diversity
of color and element composition occurred in the final self-organized
chemical garden structures, implying a possibility of purifying elements
or synthesizing gradient composites via the chemical garden route
in future.

The discovery in this research relied on the use
of the XRF movie
technique. It can reveal the nature of element species and monitor
their spatiotemporal change during the reaction. Moreover, the X-ray
movie technique can provide plenty of time-resolved XRF spectra for
microregion analysis, which semiquantitatively reflects changes in
composition and concentration at different parts. In short, the X-ray
movie technique provides much information on chemical composition,
which cannot be analyzed by an optical microscopy video. Therefore,
the technique is immensely helpful in understanding the stagewise
formation process of chemical garden structures. Nowadays, to seek
material applications for the chemical garden, more and more chemicals
are being introduced into the reaction. The use of XRF movies will
be an indispensable realtime characterization technique for the observation
of diffusing elements in such reactions.

Experimental Section
The chemical garden experiment is performed in a Hele-Shaw cell,
which is prepared by covering the upper surface of a shallow polystyrene
container with a polyester thin film. The depth of the container is
0.5 mm. The thickness of the thin film is 50 μm. The operation
of attaching the thin film has to be done very carefully to ensure
the film is perfectly flat and parallel to the bottom surface of the
container. In the experiment, the seed of the chemical garden is placed
in the container prior to attaching the thin film. After attaching,
the cell is placed vertically. The chemical garden reaction is triggered
by injecting the sodium silicate solution into the cell from the cell’s
upper edge. The dimension of the Hele-Shaw cell is 30 mm (H) × 15 mm (V).

In this research,
the seed of the chemical garden is a mixture
of calcium chloride and ferrous sulfate heptahydrate. The mass ratio
of these two salts is 1:1. They are mixed and ground into fine powders
in a mortar, and then the powders are pressed into a 0.5 mm thick
wafer. The chemical garden seed is a square of approximately 1.5 mm
× 1.5 mm, which is cut from the wafer. The color of the seed
is pale yellow. The aqueous sodium silicate solution used in this
research is diluted from a commercial concentrated solution (55 wt
% Na2SiO3). The mass ratio of the commercial
solution to the distilled water is 1:2.

The growth of the chemical
garden and the subsequent aging process
is observed by a realtime XRF movie. The technical details of the
XRF movie have been described in another work.37 The Hele-Shaw cell is fixed on the sample holder. Because
one surface of the Hele-Shaw cell is made of thin film, incident X-rays
can penetrate this surface to excite the inner reactants and fluorescence
X-rays can escape from it. The elapsed time of the chemical garden
reaction as well as the XRF movie is 15 h. After that, the Hele-Shaw
cell is moved to optical microscopy, and a photo of the precipitated
tubules is captured. The observation area of the XRF movie is approximately
7 mm (H) × 4 mm (V), which
is mainly limited by the size of the incident X-ray beam. The spatial
resolution is better than 100 μm.

The schematic illustration
of the Hele-Shaw cell under XRF movie
observation is shown in Figure 1.
