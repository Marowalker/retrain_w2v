By
pursuing the strategy of manipulating natural compounds to obtain
functional materials, in this work, we report on the synthesis and
characterization of a luminescent cationic iridium complex (cis-1), designed starting from the catecholic
neurotransmitter dopamine, exhibiting the unusual cis arrangement
of the C∧N ligands. Through an integrated experimental
and theoretical approach, it was possible to delineate the optoelectronic
properties of cis-1. In detail, (a)
a series of absorption maxima in the range 300–400 nm was assigned
to metal-to-ligand charge transfer and weak and broad absorption maxima
at longer wavelengths (400–500 nm) were ascribable to spin-forbidden
transitions with a mixed character; (b) there was an intense red phosphorescence
with emission set in the range 580–710 nm; and (c) a highest
occupied molecular orbital was mainly localized on the metal and the
2-phenylpiridine ligand and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
was localized on the N∧N ligand, with a ΔH–L set at 2.20 eV. This investigation allowed the design
of light-emitting electrochemical cell (LEEC) devices endowed with
good performance. The poor literature reporting on the use of cis-iridium(III) complexes in LEECs prompted us to investigate
the role played by the selected cathode and the thickness of the emitting
layer, as well as the doping effect exerted by ionic liquids on the
performance of the devices. All the devices exhibited a deep red emission,
in some cases, quite near the pure color (devices #1, #4, and #8),
expanding the panorama of the iridium-based red-to-near-infrared LEEC
devices. The characteristics of the devices, such as the brightness
reaching values of 162 cd/m2 for device #7, suggested that
the performances of cis-1 are comparable
to those of trans isomers, opening new perspective toward designing
a new set of luminescent materials for optoelectronic devices.

Introduction
The rise of solid-state
lighting represents an important breakthrough
for our society due to the very high efficiency and low energy consumption
of this type of devices. Among these, organic light-emitting diodes
(OLEDs) possess unique mechanical properties, allowing the fabrication
of flat, flexible, and large-area devices on different types of substrates
(e.g., glass, plastics, paper, and textile). Moreover, OLEDs exhibit
high color quality and wide color tuning achievable via selected structural
changes in organic emitters. Overall, these characteristics have stimulated
the diffusion of OLEDs in different sectors, from civil lighting to
automotive industry, from electronics to biomedical sector, from interior
design to light art and fashion industry. Since the first commercialized
OLED device (1987), the research on OLEDs rapidly has passed through
the design of more and more efficient devices, by exploiting first
the emitting properties of fluorescent polymers and/or small molecules
and then the more performing phosphorescent transition-metal complexes.1−3

With the aim of reducing the cost and time of production of
light-emitting
devices, in 1995, Pei et al. realized the first light-emitting electrochemical
cell (LEEC), the leading example of an easy-to-fabricate lighting
device, in which a single layer of solution-processed ionic emitter
is sandwiched between two electrodes.4 Besides
the choice of air-stable electrodes, most of the efforts have been
focused on the selection of the best-performing emitting layer deriving
from the combination of an emitting material (e.g., conjugated polymers,
ionic transition-metal complexes, small molecules, quantum dots) with
an ionic additive (e.g., ion polyelectrolytes, ionic liquids).5−9 Among transition-metal complexes, iridium(III) complexes proved
to be the most efficient for applications in single-layer LEEC devices.10−12 But, even though green and yellow emitting complexes have been extensively
studied, the literature reporting on red emitting iridium complexes
and their applications in LEEC devices is still scanty.13−18

Starting from this background, we planned this work with the
aim
of conjugating the simple architecture of the LEEC device with the
choice of Nature-inspired materials. The challenge of integrating
natural or Nature-inspired materials within organic electronic devices
is the focus of the well-established green electronics field.19,20 In this connection, we have recently tested the potential of eumelanins,
the black insoluble pigments of human skin, hair, and eyes, as a valid
candidate for the design and implementation of soft biocompatible
multifunctional materials for bioelectronic devices.21−24 Recently, by pursuing the strategy of manipulating natural compounds
to obtain functional materials, we have exploited the peculiar low
pH oxidative reactivity of 5,6-dihydroxyindole,25 the monomer precursor of mammalian eumelanins, to synthesize
a series of asymmetrical triazatruxenes behaving as fluorescent blue
emitters in OLED devices.26

In this
work, we explored the potential of another melanin monomer
precursor, dopamine, as the starting compound for the synthesis of
the red emitting cationic iridium complex cis-1. Well known for its role as neurotransmitter, dopamine is
also available in many food such as bananas and potatoes, thus representing
a valuable “green” building block for the synthetic
strategy.27

The synthesized iridium
complex exhibited a bis(6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline)
(2) as N∧N ancillary ligand and two
2-phenylpyridines (ppy) as C∧N main ligands set
in the unusual cis arrangement.

Although many papers in the
literature report on the different
structural, photophysical, and electronic properties exhibited by cis and trans iridium(III) complexes,28−30 only these latter have been extensively tested as emitters in OLED
and LEEC devices. De Cola and co-workers compared for the first time
the performances of electroluminescent devices fabricated with N,N-cis and N,N-trans isomers, denoting the higher luminance observed
in the case of cis isomers.31

Starting
from this evidence and exploiting the peculiar synthetic
approach allowing the isolation in pure form of cis-1, herein we report on the investigation of the photophysical
and electronic properties of the iridium complex, also by using time-dependent
density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations as a support to interpretation,
and on the performance of LEEC devices fabricated by using cis-1 as the electroluminescent material.

Results
and Discussion
Synthesis
The targeted ancillary
ligand 2 was synthesized according to a previously reported
procedure32 by using O,O-dimethyldopamine, a derivative of dopamine, as
the starting compound.
In brief, the starting compound was first treated with diethyloxalate
to afford the bis-amide intermediate 3; the latter was
then subjected to a double intramolecular cyclization under Bischler–Napieralski
reaction conditions to afford the desired compound (2) in good yields (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Synthesis of the Ancillary Ligand 2 from
a Dopamine
Derivative
(i) Diethyloxalate, toluene reflux;
and (ii) POCl3, EtOH Reflux.

As
described by Nonoyama,33 the cationic
iridium(III) complex cis-1 was synthesized
via the intermediate formation of the bridged dinuclear iridium complex 4, obtained by treating IrCl3 with the primary
ligand, 2-phenylpiridine (ppy). As generally reported for heteroleptic
iridium(III) complexes,34,35 the insertion of the
ancillary ligand 2 was pursued under very mild reaction
conditions, affording, after chromatographic purification, the complex cis-1 as PF6 salt in high yields
(Scheme 2).

Scheme 2 Synthesis
of the Iridium(III) Complex cis-1
(i) IrCl3 H2O/EtOEtOH reflux; (ii) 2, dichloromethane (DCM)/MeOH
reflux; and (iii) NH4PF6.

The identity of the complex was secured by spectroscopic analysis.
The electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) spectrum revealed
in the positive ion mode a peak at 880 m/z due to the cationic portion of the complex and in the
negative ion mode a peak at 145 m/z due to PF6–. The incorporation of the
PF6 unit was supported also by 19F NMR spectroscopy,
which displayed a doublet at 73.4 ppm with a J value
of 710 Hz due to P–F coupling.

The 1H NMR
spectrum showed a double set of signals ascribable
to the protons of two ppy units along with the signals of the 6,7-dimethoxy-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline
unit, suggesting a cis arrangement of the complex (see the Supporting
Information (SI) section).

Further
inspection of the reaction mixture revealed the presence
of cis-5, isolated in small amounts
as side product and derived from the oxidation of cis-1, and the trans-1 isomer
(Figure 1), identified
by 1H NMR and 1H,1H COSY analysis
of a rough chromatographic fraction from the reaction mixture (see
the SI section); however, their isolation
in pure form proved unviable by any chromatographic technique.

Figure 1 Minor products
identified in the reaction mixture.

The isolation of cis-1 as the
main
product was a priori unexpected. As a matter of fact, cis heteroleptic iridium(III) complexes have been isolated in only few
cases,28,31,36−38 since they tend to be less stable than the corresponding trans isomers
(see also theoretical calculations in the SI section). The formation of cis-1 could
therefore reflect the high reactivity of the corresponding trans isomer
suffering cis isomerization even at low temperature and in the presence
of light.31

Photophysical Properties
The UV–vis absorption
spectra of cis-1 were recorded in an
aerated dilute solution in dichloromethane (DCM) and in thin films
onto quartz substrates, both at 298 K (Figure 2, Table 1).

In detail, the spectrum of the solution showed an intense absorption
maximum (log ε = 5.08 M–1 cm–1) centered at 259 nm with a shoulder around 290 nm, due to spin-allowed
π–π* ligand-centered (LC) transitions for the cyclometallating
ppy and ancillary dihydroisoquinoline ligands, and, in the range 300–400
nm, a series of intense absorption maxima (log ε >
4
M–1 cm–1) assigned to metal-to-ligand
charge transfer (1MLCT) and ligand-to-ligand charge transfer
(LL′CT) transitions. The weak and broad absorption maxima at
longer wavelengths (400–500 nm) were ascribable to spin-forbidden
transitions with a mixed character. Quite a similar profile was obtained
when the analysis was carried out on thin films, with maxima red shifted
and long tails at the lower energy edge, suggesting that aggregation
occurred in the solid state.

To further support the structural
assignment of the iridium(III)
complex, the UV–vis absorption spectra of the most stable conformers
of cis-1 and trans-1 isomers were computed.

As shown in Figure 3, the simulated UV–vis
absorption spectrum of cis-1 displayed
two maxima in the 300–400 nm region;
this profile proved more similar to the experimental one than that
from the corresponding trans isomer exhibiting a single maximum in
the same region.

Figure 3 Simulated UV–vis absorption spectra of the most
stable conformers
of cis-1 (black line) and trans-1 (red line).

The emission spectrum of cis-1 revealed
the presence of a broad band (ranging from 500 to 750 nm) centered
at around 585 nm, when excited at 440 nm in diluted DCM solutions
at room temperature (Figure 2 and Table 1), suggesting a mixed 3CT character. The photoluminescence
(PL) quantum yield (Φ) was high both in aerated and oxygen-depleted
DCM solutions.

The spectrum registered on thin films at room
temperature exhibited
a maximum shifted to longer wavelength (592 nm), and the emission
profile resulted more delineated when the spectrum was registered
at 9 K (Figure 4).
In this case, three main spectral features at ca. 600, 650, and 730
nm were clearly evidenced when performing a three-Gaussian best-fit
on the emission spectrum (see the SI section).

Figure 4 Emission
spectrum (λexc = 440 nm) of cis-1 as thin film at 9 K.

Photoluminescence excitation (PLE) analysis was also carried
out
to delineate the excitation spectra of the three emission bands (see
the SI section); the results in Figure S7 show that the investigated emission
bands shared very similar excitation spectra, each exhibiting three
regions in which the excitation spectrum had a local maximum centered
at around 4.1 eV, 3.4 eV (broad), and 2.7 eV (sharp). Given the well-known
fact that excitation spectra in molecular systems mimic the absorption
spectra, it is natural to conclude that the features in the excitation
spectra, highlighted in yellow in Figure S7, corresponded to the allowed optical transitions of the material.

By integrating the data obtained from the spectroscopic investigation
and those calculated by the TD-DFT approach, it was possible to delineate
a general picture of the main transitions of cis-1 (Figure S10).

The structure
of the emission band can be tentatively attributed
to a vibrational progression. Thanks to recent developments,39 the computation of vibrational band structures
is becoming feasible even for large molecules in condensed phases;40 however, such calculations remain by no means
trivial. In particular, in the case of cis-1, the change in equilibrium geometry between the two involved
electronic states is significant, which makes for a very small value
of the overlap integral between the vibrational ground states, and
prevents reliable spectral simulations. However, analysis of the emission
spectrum of a simplified model of cis-1 proved feasible within the Franck–Condon/adiabatic Hessian
framework. Figure 5 displays the computed vibrational structure.

Figure 5 Vibrational band structure
of the phosphorescence spectrum of a
simplified model of cis-1 (see inset)
computed within the Franck–Condon/adiabatic Hessian framework.
A Gaussian line broadening of 80.00 cm–1 (halfwidth
at half intensity maximum) was applied to the spectral lines.

Since the computation is based
on a structurally simplified model,
the results are best interpreted in relative terms. In this sense,
the overall structure of the band is indeed rather close to the experimental
observation, with spacing between maxima of 1525 and 1400 cm–1. Discrepancies (e.g., in the relative intensity of the maxima) might
well reflect a neglect of the temperature effects, as well as intrinsic
limitations of the adopted theoretical frame.

Thermal Properties
Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to assess the
thermal properties of cis-1. As shown
in Figure S6 (see the SI section), the
iridium complex exhibited a good stability with no loss of weight
up to 500 °C and a high glass transition temperature (Tg) at 247 °C.

Electrochemical Properties
Cyclic voltammetry (CV)
was carried out to investigate the electrochemical properties of cis-1. The CV analyses were performed in nitrogen-saturated
acetonitrile at room temperature using Bu4NPF6 as the supporting electrolyte and Fc/Fc+ as an internal
standard at 298 K. All potentials were referenced to saturated calomel
electrode (SCE, E(Fc/Fc+) =
0.40 V in acetonitrile).

As reported in Table 3 and shown in Figure S8, the complex exhibited two quasi-reversible oxidation/reduction
waves at +0.90 and −1.30 V, respectively. The first one is
referred to a metal-centered oxidation process suffering a strong
contribution from the cyclometalating ligands, ppy; the second one
is referred to the reduction process of the dihydroisoquinoline unit.
This is also supported by the computed highest occupied molecular
orbital (HOMO)/lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) electron
density contour plot (Figure 6), denoting that the HOMO is mainly localized on the metal
and on the ppy ligand, whereas the LUMO is localized on the N∧N ligand.

were used as the
working and counter electrodes, respectively, whereas an Ag/AgCl reference
electrode was employed; scan rate: 50 mV/s. Reduction and oxidation
values are in V vs SCE (Fc/Fc+ vs SCE = 0.40 V).41Eox and Ered have been taken as EonsetΔH–L = −(EHOMO – ELUMO).

The oxidation potential of cis-1 was
computed via single-point polarizable continuum medium (PCM) calculations
modeling a ionic medium,42 namely, acetonitrile
at a 0.1 M ionic strength. The resulting value of 1.13 V vs SCE is
in satisfactory agreement with the experimental counterpart (0.90
V vs SCE in Table 3), thus providing a validation of the theoretical model adopted and
the corresponding analysis.

The HOMO and LUMO energy levels,
calculated from the onset oxidation/reduction
potentials, were set at −5.30 and −3.10 eV (Table 3), respectively, with
a ΔH–L = 2.20 eV, slightly lower than the
optical band gap estimated from the red edge of the longest-wavelength
absorption in solution (Egopt = 2.38 eV).

LEEC Devices
To
investigate the potential of cis-1 as
the emitting layer, eight LEEC devices
have been fabricated differing in (1) the thickness of the ionic emitting
layer (50 or 100 nm); (2) the selected cathode (Ag or Ca/Al); and
(3) the use of different blends of cis-1 with the ionic liquid dimethylimidazolium dimethylphosphate (DMI-DMP),
the latter is selected as a dopant to improve the device characteristics,
particularly to lower the ton time.43−45 In all cases, the anode is a 200 nm thick layer of indium tin oxide
(ITO) sputtered onto quartz and coated with a 60 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene
sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) to smoothen the roughness of ITO and facilitate
charge injection. The configurations of the devices and the corresponding
energy-level diagrams are reported in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Tested LEEC structures and energy-level diagrams
(in electron volts).

As reported in Table 4, Ag-based devices (#3 and #4) exhibited better performances
than
those fabricated by using Ca/Al (#1 and #2) as cathode; moreover,
Ag-based devices fabricated with thicker emitting layers led to best-performing
LEECs both in terms of luminance, efficiency, and power efficiency
(#4).

Worth noting is the effect of the
ionic liquid DMI-DMP on the performance
of the LEEC devices, leading to a marked improvement of the characteristics
when the emitting layer was constituted by a 2:1 (molar ratio) blend
of cis-1 and DMI-DMP (#7; Figure 8).

Figure 8 Luminance and efficiency
characteristics of the best-performing
LEEC device.

The effect proved to
be modest in the case of the 4:1 blend of cis-1 and DMI-DMP (#8), whereas a marked drop
in the luminance was observed for the 1:2 blend (#6) and in the case
of the Ca/Al-based device (#5). A significant reduction of the time ton was also observed with the increasing content
of DMI-DMP in the emitting blend (from 43 to 19 min). For all the
devices, the turn-on voltages (defined as the voltages at which the
luminance is >1 cd/m2) proved to be quite low and in
the
range 4.0–7.1 V. The device lifetimes proved to be satisfactory,
with a slow luminance decay over 2 h for the best-performing device
#7 (see the SI section).

The electroluminescence
spectra of the LEEC devices exhibited slightly
different profiles with respect to the solution and thin films emission
spectra. When only cis-1 was used as
the emitting layer, a single broad emission band covering the range
600–730 nm was visible with a maximum centered at around 660
nm denoting a deep red emission. Interestingly, when passing to the
blend of cis-1 with the ionic liquid
DMI-DMP, the emission maximum progressively shifted to lower wavelengths
with the rise of the ratio DMI-DMP/cis-1 (Figure 9). This
effect may be ascribed to a reduced degree of aggregation of cis-1 at the solid state due to the presence
of the ionic liquid. The Commission Internationale de l’Éclairage
(CIE) coordinates reported in Table 4 were all positioned along the spectral locus, suggesting
that pure colors were emitted (Figure 9). Worth noting are devices #1, #4, and #8 with CIE
coordinates quite near those of pure red (0.64, 0.33).

Conclusions
In
summary, in this study, we have described the synthesis and
optoelectronic properties of a luminescent cationic iridium(III) complex
featuring a dopamine-inspired ligand and an unusual cis arrangement
of the C∧N ligands around the metal. The investigation
of the optoelectronic properties, supported also by TD-DFT calculations,
suggested that the complex was characterized by a singlet-to-triplet
transition responsible for the emission in the red region of the spectrum.
Finally, the performances of the first LEEC device designed by using
a red emitting cis-iridium(III) complex were investigated.
These pointed out the relevant role played by ionic liquids in enhancing
the efficiency of the device and reducing the turn-on time. Worth
noting are the high luminance values reached when performing with
ionic liquids and the deep red emission, reaching in some cases the
pure red, exhibited by these LEEC devices. To the best of our knowledge,
the characteristics of the best-performing LEEC device (#7) are comparable
to those of many other red emitting LEECs designed by using trans iridium(III) complexes and are in line with those
reported by De Cola et al. for a similar cis-iridium(III)
complex; this evidence opens a door to a new class of electroluminescent
materials for optoelectronic applications.

Experimental Section
Synthesis
of cis-1
A suspension of 4 (400
mg, 0.37 mmol) in CH2Cl2/MeOH
(80 mL, 2:1 v/v) was treated under stirring with 2 (280
mg, 0.74 mmol) and heated to reflux. After 45 min, the solution was
cooled to room temperature and treated with NH4PF6 (600 mg, 3.7 mmol), dissolved in methanol (10 mL). After 30 min,
the reaction mixture was evaporated under reduced pressure and the
red residue was rinsed with CH2Cl2, filtered
to remove insoluble inorganic salts, and evaporated under reduced
pressure. The crude solid was purified by liquid chromatography on
a silica gel using dichloromethane/methanol 99:1 (v/v) affording the
complex cis-1 in pure form (564 mg,
75%, Rf = 0.52 chloroform/methanol 95:5
(v/v)).

Low-Temperature PL and PLE Analyses
The photoluminescence
(PL) measurements of thin films were carried out by using a HeCd laser
(laser wavelength λ = 325 and 442 nm) as the excitation source.
The excitation-resolved photoluminescence (PLE) measurements were
carried out by using a broadband 450 W power Xe lamp coupled with
a computer-controlled double-grating monochromator, providing tunable
monochromatized light (spectral full width at half-maximum of about
3 nm) as the tunable excitation source. The samples were placed in
a closed-cycle He optical cryostat equipped with an optical quartz
window. Further details on the spectroscopic setup and spectral correction
have been previously reported in the literature.46 All PL and PLE measurements were performed at a sample
temperature of 9 K.

Device Fabrication
Indium tin oxide
(ITO)-coated glass
plates (15 Ω/sq) were patterned by conventional photolithography.
The substrates were cleaned by successive 10 min sonication periods
in deionized (DI) water-soap, then rinsed with DI water, and finally
2-propanol baths. After drying, the substrates were placed in an UV–ozone
cleaner (Jelight 42-220) for 20 min. The devices were prepared as
follows. First, a 40 nm layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate)
(PEDOT:PSS) (CLEVIOS P VP AI 4083, Heraeus) was spin-coated on the
patterned ITO glass substrate to smoothen the ITO roughness and baked
at 100 °C for 1 h. Then, 100 or 50 nm films of cis-1 were spin-coated from a 20 mg/mL or a 10 mg/mL chlorobenzene
solution at 3000 rpm/500 rpm/s for 20 s. Other devices were fabricated
by spin-coating, as an emitting layer, a blend of cis-1 with dimethylimidazolium-dimethylphosphate (DMI-DMP)
in different molar ratios. Each solution was filtered through a 0.2
μm PTFE filter prior to the spin-coating process. The devices
were transferred to an inert atmosphere glovebox (<0.1 ppm O2 and H2O, MBraun) and annealed at 100 °C for
1 h. Finally, using a shadow mask, the calcium/aluminum electrode
(30 + 70 nm) was thermally evaporated under vacuum (<1 × 10–6 mbar) with a Lesker evaporator integrated in the
glovebox. The emitting area of the devices was around 7 mm2. The devices were not encapsulated and were characterized inside
the glovebox at room temperature. The optical characterization of
the LEEC devices was performed using a Gooch and Housego OL770 spectroradiometer
coupled with an integrating sphere and a camera telescope. The electrical
measurements of the LEEC devices were performed with a Keithley 2400
SourceMeter.

Computational Details
All calculations
were performed
with the Gaussian package of programs.47 All structures were geometry optimized at the DFT level with a hybrid
functional (M06-2X).48 The 6-31+G(d,p)
basis set was used of H, C, N, and O atoms; the Stuttgart/Dresden
pseudopotential and basis set49,50 were adopted for the
iridium center. For each species, different conformers were explored.
In those cases where different enantiomers exist, a single enantiomeric
series has been examined.

To account for the influence of the
solution environment (chloroform), a polarizable continuum medium
(PCM) was adopted.51−54 In view of the faster convergence, a scaled van der Waals cavity
based on universal force field radii55 was
used, and polarization charges were modeled by spherical Gaussian
functions.56,57 Vibrational–rotational
contributions to the free energy were also computed.

UV–vis
spectra of the main species were computed in a solution
using the time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) approach58−62 with the same functional/basis set/pseudopotential combination.
To produce graphs, transitions below 5.6 eV were selected and an arbitrary
Gaussian line width of 0.25 eV was imposed; the spectra were finally
converted to a wavelength scale. The nonequilibrium linear response
formulation of the PCM was adopted for TD-DFT calculations; a state-specific
approach63,64 was employed to evaluate the energy of the
first triplet state at the equilibrium geometry of the ground-state
singlet, or vice versa the energy of the ground-state singlet at the
equilibrium geometry of the first triplet.

For all models, the
central iridium and the two bis-isoquinoline
nitrogens were chosen to define the horizontal plane, and the apical/equatorial
descriptors were used to define the positions of the two remaining
pyridine nitrogens.
