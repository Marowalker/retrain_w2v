Despite
the low bond strength of the oxygen–oxygen bond,
organic peroxides are often surprisingly resistant to cleavage by
nucleophiles and reductants. As a result, achieving decomposition
under mild conditions can be challenging. Herein, we explore the reactivity
of a selection of peroxides toward thiolates, phenyl selenide, Fe(II)
salts, and iron thiolates. Peroxides activated by conjugation, strain,
or stereoelectronics are rapidly cleaved at room temperature by thiolate
anions, phenylselenide, or Fe(II) salts. Under the same conditions,
unhindered dialkyl peroxides are only marginally reactive; hindered
peroxides, including triacetone triperoxide and diacetone diperoxide
(DADP), are inert. In contrast, all but the most hindered of peroxides
are rapidly (<1 min at concentrations down to ∼40 mM) cleaved
by mixtures of thiols and iron salts. Our observations suggest the
possible intermediacy of strongly reducing complexes that are readily
regenerated in the presence of stoichiometric thiolate or hydride.
In the case of DADP, an easily prepared explosive of significant societal
concern, catalytic amounts of iron and thiol are capable of promoting
rapid and complete disproportionation. The availability of inexpensive
and readily available catalysts for the mild reductive degradation
of all but the most hindered of peroxides could have significant applications
for controlled remediation of explosives or unwanted radical initiators.

Introduction
In the course of investigations
into reaction of carbanions with
organic peroxides, we became intrigued by the often low reactivity
of the thermodynamically weak O–O bond,1 an incongruity previously observed in electrochemical and chemical
reductions.2,3 The high barriers associated with peroxide
cleavage can make it difficult to achieve controlled decomposition
under mild conditions during decontamination or reaction work-up procedures.
In an effort to better understand the factors controlling reductive
and/or nucleophilic attack on an O–O bond, we investigated
the reactivity of several classes of peroxides toward thiolates, selenides,
and/or iron salts. Individually, the reagents cleave only activated
peroxides. However mixtures of Fe(II) or Fe(III) salts and thiols,
possibly in the form of Fe/thiol complexes, catalyze reductive cleavage
of all but the most hindered of peroxides.

Reductive cleavage
of hydrogen peroxide and alkyl hydroperoxides
by thiolates and selenides is well known.4,5 The
same is true of peroxides activated by conjugation, stereoelectronics,
or strain.6 For example, ozonides (1,2,4-trioxolanes)
are reduced by glutathione,7 and we have
demonstrated rapid inactivation of the enzyme papain by an ozonide-containing
dipeptide analog.8 Selenoperoxidases are
able to reduce strained cyclic peroxides.9,10 In
contrast, unstrained dialkyl peroxides are inert toward thiols,11 and reported reductions by thiolates employ
high temperatures12 or involve substrates
susceptible to base-promoted fragmentation.13 Similar trends are seen with ferrous iron, which rapidly cleaves
hydrogen peroxide (Fenton reaction),14 alkyl
hydroperoxides,15,16 and activated or unhindered dialkyl
peroxides.17−19 Fe(II)-promoted cleavage of hindered dialkyl peroxides
typically requires reaction temperatures at which radical thermolysis
of the peroxide is expected to be significant;20,21 however, a hindered 1,2-dioxolane that induces iron-dependent regulated
cell death (ferroptosis) has been shown to undergo room-temperature
cleavage by soluble Fe(II).22 The peroxyacetal
core of the antimalarial artemisinin, which is reactive toward Fe(II)
but not thiols, is reductively cleaved by cysteine in the presence
of catalytic amounts of iron; follow-up studies observed similar reactivity
with other peroxide substrates.23

Results
and Discussion
Preparation of peroxide substrates is illustrated
in Scheme 1. Peroxyacetal 1 and dialkyl peroxides 2 and 3 were
prepared
by alkylation of a hydroperoxyacetal,24 hydrogen peroxide (two-fold reaction), or t-butyl
hydroperoxide, respectively, with sulfonates derived from 3-phenyl-propanol.1t-Butyl peroxybenzoate (4) is commercially available but also easily prepared through
oxidative peresterification.25 Triacetone
triperoxide (TATP, 5) and diacetone diperoxide (DADP, 6) were prepared through acid-promoted condensations of acetone
with hydrogen peroxide.26Caution: TATP and DADP are shock-, friction-, heat-, and spark-sensitive
high explosives and can decompose violently in strong acid.26−29 Peroxide 7 was prepared from the corresponding tertiary
bromide following a reported procedure;2b peroxide 8 was available through methylation of the
known tertiary hydroperoxide.30

Scheme 1 Peroxide
Substrates
The reactivity of
the peroxides toward thiolates and selenides
is summarized in Table 1. Three approaches were used for nucleophile generation: (1) stoichiometric
deprotonation of thiophenol with potassium tert-butoxide;31 (2) deprotonation with a much weaker base (triethylamine);
(3) reductive cleavage of diphenyl disulfide or diphenyl diselenide.32,33 Reactions were monitored by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) using
both conventional and peroxide-sensitive indicators.34 With the exception of peroxyacetal 1, which
rapidly undergoes base-promoted E1CB (Kornblum) cleavage,35 little or no reactivity was observed with base
(rows 1, 2), hydride (row 3) or thiophenol (row 4). Peroxyacetal 1 and perester 4 were rapidly decomposed by phenyl
thiolate, regardless of how they were generated. However, the dialkyl
peroxides (2 and 3), as well as the two
acetone peroxides (5 and 6), was proved
inert. A similar reactivity was observed with phenyl selenide, although
traces of reduction products were detected from 2 and 3 after prolonged reaction.

Table 2 illustrates
reactions incorporating ferrous iron. Although monoperoxyacetal 1 and perester 4 undergo slow decomposition at
room temperature in the presence of FeBr2, the dialkyl
peroxides (2 and 3) and the acetone peroxides
(5 and 6) are inert (Table 2, row 1). A dramatic enhancement in reactivity
was observed from the combination of iron and thiols (Table 2, rows 2–8). Addition
of thiophenol to the orange-brown solutions containing FeBr2 and peroxides resulted in a dark suspension, which clarified, often
within less than a minute, to a light green solution (Figure S1). Monitoring of reactions by TLC revealed
that consumption of the peroxide approximately paralleled the clearing
of the suspension.34 Reactions could be
conducted in tetrahydrofuran (THF) or CD3CN and were unaffected
by addition of small amounts (1–2 v/v %) of water or Et3N (not shown).

Isolated
yields for selected reactions of peroxides 2, 3, and 4 in CD3CN are illustrated
in Table 3. In contrast
to the 2:1 stoichiometry expected for reaction of alkyl thiols with
hydrogen peroxide or alkyl hydroperoxides,36 complete consumption of peroxides 1–4 could
be achieved using stoichiometric thiol; the use of 0.5 equiv of thiol
resulted in a reduced yield of alcohol and recovery of half of the
peroxide substrate (Table 3, row 2). In contrast, the reduction of TATP (5) in the presence of catalytic Fe(II) and excess thiol was extremely
slow (eq 1). The use
of a more electron-rich thiol had no discernible impact. The stoichiometry
of DADP decomposition is discussed below. 1

Peroxide 7, developed as a clock for electrochemically
generated alkoxy radicals,2 proved unreactive
(Scheme 2). However,
a less hindered analog (8) underwent rapid reduction
(minutes), to furnish a low yield of 2-methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanol
and larger amounts of acetone, toluene, and phenyl benzyl sulfide.

Nature of the Thiol and
the Iron Source
As illustrated
in eq 2, a variety of
thiols, including a dithiol, could be successfully applied to the
reduction; for reasons that remain unclear, no reduction was observed
in the presence of dithiothreitol (not shown). No reaction was observed
when diphenyl disulfide was used in place of thiophenol (eq 3). The dependence upon iron source
was investigated via the reduction of DADP (6) in the
presence of stoichiometric thiophenol (Table 4). Rapid and complete decomposition of the
peroxide was observed in the presence of catalytic amounts of multiple
Fe(II) salts as well as iron(III) chloride; in each case, analysis
of the crude reaction mixtures by NMR revealed acetone as the only
detectable product (Figure S2). Reaction
in the presence of iron tetraphenylporphyrin was quite slow and no
reaction was observed in the presence of ferrocene or iron oxide (Fe2O3). 2   3

Stoichiometry
The amount of reductant
required was
probed using dialkyl peroxide 3 and acetone peroxide 6 (Table 5).
Complete consumption of 3 was observed using 1% of FeBr2 and either stoichiometric or excess thiophenol. Reductions
in CD3CN generated nearly pure samples of the phenylpropanol
product (TLC, NMR; Figure S2); reactions
in THF generated the same major product but in addition displayed
evidence [TLC, NMR, gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS)]
of a number of byproducts, each present at a low level. Use of substoichiometric
thiol resulted in incomplete reaction. DADP (6) was completely
decomposed by the combination of catalytic Fe(II) and either stoichiometric
or substoichiometric thiol to generate acetone as the only detectable
product; rapid reaction was observed with as little as 0.1% FeBr2 (Figure S2).

Calorimetry
Reduction
of dialkyl peroxide 3 in the presence of catalytic Fe(II)
and stoichiometric thiol was
exothermic by >30 kcal/mol when conducted in CH3CN and
by a somewhat smaller amount when conducted in THF (Scheme 3). As will be discussed later,
neither value approaches that calculated for a catalyzed reduction
of a peroxide bond at the expense of two molecules of thiol. The differing
heats of reaction measured in the two solvents, along with our qualitative
observations of a number of minor byproducts from reactions in THF,
may suggest a more complicated mechanism (vide infra). The decomposition
of diperoxide 6 to acetone, a transformation which can
be accomplished in the presence of catalytic amounts of Fe and thiol
(see Table 4) was even
less exothermic.

Scheme 3 Reaction Thermochemistry
See
the Experimental
Procedures section for details.

Reduction
could also be accomplished with stoichiometric hydride
(Table 6). Dialkyl
peroxide 3 is inert toward iBu2AlH (DIBAL-H) or BH3·THF, but is rapidly cleaved
to 3-phenyl-1-propanol by either reagent in the presence of catalytic
amounts of FeBr2 and thiophenol. No reaction was observed
with less reactive hydride sources.

Discussion
Reduction
of activated peroxides, for example, peroxyacetals, ozonides,
or peresters, been accomplished using a variety of reagents.37 However, the reduction of unactivated dialkyl
peroxides is more challenging.3,37 Reduction of DADP and
TATP, of particular interest due to their ready availability as well
as their use in acts of terrorism,26−29 has been achieved with SnCl2 in boiling ethanol,28 with Cr3+ or Co2+ species,29a,29b or with alloyed
bimetals or emulsified metals.38 Although
Fe(II)-promoted activation of hindered dialkyl peroxides has been
described, the reported reaction temperatures are often commensurate
with peroxide thermolysis.20 Reported Fe(III)-promoted
decompositions of di-t-butyl peroxide and a ketone
peroxide are likely to involve Lewis-acid-promoted release of an intermediate
ferric peroxide.39 However, we note that
low-temperature activation of di-t-alkyl peroxides
has been achieved with electron-rich copper complexes.40

The greatly enhanced reactivity observed
from the combination of
thiols and iron salts suggests the possible intermediacy of Fe/thiol
complexes or similar intermediates possessing greater reducing potential
relative to either individual reductant (eq 4).41 The combination
of Fe(II) and cysteine has been reported to achieve a rapid reduction
of artemisinin and related peroxides.23 However, whereas the peroxyacetal of artemisinin is sufficiently
activated to react with Fe(II) in the absence of thiol,18,23 we observed reduction of several substrates inert toward either
Fe(II) or thiophenolate. 4  

The Fe/thiol-promoted reductions display a
number of interesting
features: (1) the active species can be regenerated by thiolate or
hydride; (2) decomposition of a dialkyl peroxide requires only 1 equiv
of thiol or hydride; and (3) the reductions of dialkyl peroxides are
considerably less exothermic than what would be predicted by bond
energies for a two-proton, two-electron reduction (eq 5).42 5  

The intermediacy of alkoxy radicals is strongly
supported by the
products derived from cleavage of probe molecule 8 (Scheme 4).2b,43 The much greater yield of acetone (87%) compared with 2-methyl-1-phenyl-2-propanol
(14%) indicates that unimolecular scission of the alkoxide radical
is much more rapid than bimolecular trapping by thiol.44 The preferential capture of the resulting benzyl
radical to form thioether versus toluene suggests that the released
carbon radical reacts more rapidly with catalyst than with thiol,
paralleling observations made by Wu.23

Scheme 4 Evidence for an Alkoxy Radical Intermediate
Relative
yields in parentheses.

A possible mechanism,
illustrated in Scheme 5, begins with Fenton-type cleavage of the
peroxide by the presumed Fe/thiol complex to generate an oxidized
complex, an alkoxide and an alkoxy radical. Selective oxidation at
Fe has been observed in Fe–S complexes.45 Although we do not yet have good kinetic data, we note
that under some of our most commonly employed conditions, decomposition
of peroxide and thiol (each 0.34 M) in the presence of 3.4–17
mM Fe(II) is complete in less than a minute. Several species are likely
capable of reduction of the oxidized intermediate: thiol or hydride,
one or the other of which is present in stoichiometric amounts in
most of the reductions described here; thiophenyl radical,46 available from the thiol from oxidation or via
hydrogen abstraction by the alkoxy radical intermediate;47 or carbon radicals, whether derived from scission
of the initially formed alkoxy radical or via attack of the alkoxy
radical on a hydrogen atom donor (e.g., THF).48 Diphenyl disulfide, observed as a major product in every reaction
employing stoichiometric thiol, was isolated in 70% yield from a preparative
trial. However, the amounts of thiol consumed and disulfide produced
are insufficient to explain reaction stoichiometry. Similarly, while
we cannot rule out the oxidative dimerization or polymerization of
thiyl radicals,46 we do not observe byproducts
associated with these pathways. Scission of alkoxy radicals, including tert-butoxy radical, is well established in reactions of
Fe(II) with hydroperoxides or peroxides, and carbon radicals could
play a role here in the reduction of the putative Fe(III) intermediate.15a,49,50 Interestingly, the Fe(II)/cysteine-promoted
decomposition of artemisinin was found to result in formation of thioethers
derived by trapping of an intermediate carbon radical.22 We did not observed thiylated co-products, for
example, 2-phenylthio tetrahydrofuran, from our model reductions;
however, we did observe a significant amount of thioether upon reductive
cleavage of alkoxy radical probe 8 (see Scheme 4).

Scheme 5 Proposed Mechanism
for Fe/SR-Promoted Reductions
The Fe/thiol catalyzed disproportionation of DADP to acetone
presumably
also begins with a Fenton-type cleavage (eq 6). The modest exothermicity of the overall
process, as well as the requirement for only catalytic amounts of
Fe and thiol, suggests the formation of a downstream species capable
of reducing the oxidized catalyst. We suggest that the alkoxide/alkoxy
radical derived from the Fenton reaction undergoes loss of acetone
to generate an α-metallodioxy alkoxy radical which can regenerate
the Fe(II)-catalyst via formation of acetone and oxygen. Our measured
heat of reaction agrees closely with values reported for a thermal
decomposition of DADP.51 6  

Conclusion
The limited reactivity
of many peroxides toward reductive or nucleophilic
cleavage can be useful in terms of storage, shipping, and the serum
stability of peroxide-based antimalarial agents.52 However, this kinetic stability can create a challenge
to decomposing hindered ozonides or peroxides,53 including peroxide explosives.27−29 The ability
of Fe/thiol complexes to catalyze the rapid reduction or disproportionation
of all but the most hindered of peroxides under mild conditions could
have significant applications for controlled remediation of peroxide-based
explosives or unwanted peroxides28−30 or as an approach for
activation of peroxides in biological settings.22

Experimental Procedures
General Methods
All reactions were
conducted in flame-dried
glassware under an atmosphere of N2 except where indicated.
Reagents and solvents were used as supplied commercially, except for
THF, which was distilled from Na/benzophenone and CH2Cl2, acetonitrile, and pyridine, which were distilled from CaH2. Extracted organic layers were dried using sodium sulfate
and filtered through a cotton plug. 1H and 13C spectra were acquired in CDCl3, d8-THF, or CD3CN at 400 MHz (1H) or 100
MHz (13C) unless noted otherwise. Chemical shifts are reported
relative to residual chloroform (7.26 ppm for 1H and 77.0
ppm for 13C) and residual acetonitrile (1.96 ppm for 1H). IR spectra were obtained on neat films (ZnSe, attenuated
total reflection mode); selected absorbances are reported in wavenumbers
(cm–1). Flash column chromatography was performed
on 230–400 μM silica gel. TLC was performed on 0.25 mm
hard-layer silica G plates containing a fluorescent indicator; developed
TLC plates were visualized with a hand-held UV lamp, or by heating
after staining with either: a peroxide-sensitive solution prepared
from 1.2 g N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine monohydrochloride, 1 mL acetic acid,
20 mL of water, and 100 mL of methanol;34 or a general purpose dip composed of vanillin and sulfuric acid
in ethanol. Abbreviations throughout: EA = ethyl acetate; Hex = hexane;
DCM = dichloromethane. THF = tetrahydrofuran.

3-Phenylpropyl Trifluoromethanesulfonate1
To a 0 °C solution of 3-phenyl-propanol
(2.51 g, 18.4
mmol) in 50 mL of dichloromethane (DCM) was added 5.21 g (19 mmol)
of trifluoromethanesulfonic (triflic) anhydride. Pyridine (1.48 g,
19.0 mmol) was then added over a period of 5 min, and the reaction
was allowed to stir for 30 min. The reaction was then quenched by
addition of 10 mL of cold hexane and 10 mL of cold 0.1 M aq KHSO4. The mixture was extracted with cold Hex (2 × 30 mL).
The combined organic extracts were dried and then concentrated under
reduced pressure, with the bath temperature held below 10 °C
during concentration. The crude product, a light to medium pink oil,
was used immediately and without further purification for peroxide
synthesis. The reagent can be held for a few hours at −20 °C
without excessive decomposition but should be used as soon as possible.

3-Phenylpropyl Methanesulfonate
The methanesulfonate was prepared using a modification of
a reported procedure.54 To a room temperature
solution of 3-phenyl-propanol (2.00 g, 14.71 mmol) in 20 mL of DCM
was added triethylamine (2.97 g, 29.42 mmol) followed by 1.84 g (16.18
mmol) of methanesulfonyl chloride slowly over 2 min. The reaction
was allowed to stir for 2 h. The reaction was then quenched by addition
of aq 6 M HCl (10 mL). The mixture was extracted with ether (3 ×
30 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried and then concentrated
under reduced pressure. The crude product, a light to medium yellow
brown oil, was used immediately and without further purification for
peroxide synthesis. If further purification is needed, the oil can
be dissolved in a 70/30 mixture of ether/ethyl acetate (EA) and run
through a silica plug. Spectra matched those reported previously.55

2-Hydroperoxytetrahydro-2H-pyran
This hydroperoxyacetal was synthesized
using a known procedure.1 To a 0 °C
solution of hydrogen peroxide
(35% in H2O, 20 mL, ∼200 mmol) was added concentrated
H2SO4 (0.1 mL) slowly. After the solution had
been stirred for 10 min, 2.00 g of 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran (25.88 mmol) was added slowly over 5 min. The reaction was
stirred for 4 h at 0 °C and then quenched with 10 mL of saturated
NH4Cl in H2O. The resulting mixture was extracted
using ether (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic extracts were washed
with H2O (20 mL), dried over a small amount of Na2SO4, and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The
residue was then purified by chromatography (5% EA/Hex) to yield 1.92
g (16.3 mmol, 63%) of a colorless oil. The spectra matched those previously
reported.1

2-((3-Phenylpropyl)peroxy)tetrahydro-2H-pyran
(1)
Peroxyacetal 2 was
synthesized using a known
procedure.1 To a 0 °C solution of
KOtBu (2.24 g, 20.0 mmol) in 50 mL of THF was added
2.4 g (20.3 mmol) of the 2-hydroperoxytetrahydropyran (above), followed,
over 5 min, by addition of previously prepared 3-phenylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
(∼18.4 mmol, added neat). The reaction was stirred for 4 h
and then quenched with 30 mL of water. The mixture was extracted with
EA (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried and
then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was then purified
by chromatography (20% EA/Hex) to yield 2.21 g (9.38 mmol, 51%) of
peroxyacetal 1. The 1H NMR spectra closely
matched those in a previous report:1Rf: 0.70 (10% EA/Hex); 1H NMR: δ
1.57–1.61 (overlapping peaks, 4H), 1.76 (m, 2H), 1.99 (m, 2H),
2.74 (t, 2H, J = 7.6), 4.02 (t, 1H, J = 11.6), 3.83 (t, 1H, J = 11.6), 4.14 (t, 2H, J = 6.4), 5.18 (t, 1H, J = 3.6), 7.21–7.30
(overlapping peaks, 5H).

(Peroxybis(propane-3,1-diyl))dibenzene (2)
Dialkyl peroxide 2 was prepared
by a modification
of a reported procedure.54 To a 0 °C
solution of 3-phenylpropyl methanesulfonate (1.00 g, 4.07 mmol)1 in 50 mL of MeOH was added 1.65 g (18.68 mmol)
of aq H2O2 (35%, used as received), followed,
over 5 min, by 7.43 g (13.52 mmol) of KOH dissolved in water as a
aq 50% solution. The reaction was allowed to warm to room temperature
and then stirred for 4 h prior to quenching by addition of 20 mL of
3 M HCl. The crude reaction mixture was extracted with Hex (3 ×
40 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried and then concentrated
under reduced pressure. The residue was then purified by chromatography
(10% EA/Hex) to yield 0.20 g (0.74 mmol, 20%) of dialkyl peroxide 2 accompanied by varying amounts of the phenylpropyl hydroperoxide.
If desired, the latter can be reacted with additional methanesulfonate
to generate additional quantities of 2. Rf: 0.73 (10% EA/Hex); 1H NMR (400 MHz): δ

g, 20.0 mmol) in 50 mL of THF was added 3.64 mL of t-butyl hydroperoxide as a solution in decane (nominally 5.5 M, 20.3
mmol). The previously prepared 3-phenylpropyl trifluoromethanesulfonate
(∼18.4 mmol)1 was added over a period
of 5 min and the reaction was allowed to stir for 4 h before being
quenched with 30 mL of water. The resulting mixture was extracted
using EA (3 × 40 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried
and then concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was then
purified by chromatography (20% EA/Hex) to yield 1.88 g (9.02 mmol,
49%) of dialkyl peroxide 3. Rf: 0.71 (10% EA/Hex); 1H NMR: δ 1.29 (s, 9H), 1.98
(t, 2H, J = 7.4), 2.74 (t, 2H, J = 7.8), 4.00 (t, 2H, J = 6.4), 7.22–7.289
(overlapping peaks, 5H); 13C NMR: δ 26.5 (CH3), 29.7 (CH2), 32.53 (CH2), 74.33 (CH2), 80.19 (C), 125.96 (CH), 128.47 (CH), 128.53 (CH), 141.92
(C); IR: 2977, 2928, 1361. Spectra matched those in a previous report.1

tert-Butyl Benzoperoxoate
(4)
Perester 5 was
prepared by a known procedure.25 To a room
temperature solution of tetrabutyl
ammonium iodide (1.7 g, 4.6 mmol) in 40 mL of H2O under
a balloon of oxygen was added 1.00 g (9.2 mmol) of benzyl alcohol,
followed by 6.7 mL of t-butyl hydroperoxide solution
(nominally 5.5 M in decane, 37.0 mmol, all at once). The reaction
was allowed to stir for 16 h and then diluted with 30 mL of ether.
The separated aqueous layer was extracted with additional ether (2
× 30 mL) and the combined organic extracts were dried over Na2SO4. The filtrate was concentrated under reduced
pressure and the residue purified by chromatography (10% EA/Hex) to
yield 1.44 g (7.45 mmol, 81%) of perester 4. Rf: 0.63 (10% EA/Hex); 1H NMR: δ
1.44 (s, 9H), 1.98 (t, 2H, J = 7.4), 7.48 (t, 2H, J = 8), 7.61 (t, 1H, J = 8), 7.98 (d, 2H, J = 8); 13C NMR: δ 26.37 (CH3), 84.1 (C), 127.86 (CH), 128.74 (CH), 129.25 (CH), 133.46 (C); IR:
2981, 2936, 1754, 1189.

TATP (5)
Caution: TATP and
DADP (following entry) are shock-, friction-, heat-, and spark-sensitive
high explosives.26,28−30

To acetone (1.2 g, 20 mmol) cooled to 0 °C was
added 1.97 g (20 mmol) of 35% hydrogen peroxide solution. Then, 0.1
mL of concentrated HCl was added to the solution. The reaction was
allowed to warm to room temperature and allowed to stir for 24 h,
resulting in the formation of a white crystal. The filtered solid
(vacuum filtration) was washed with cold H2O (3 ×
10 mL) and then dried by pulling air through the product mass for
1 h. The resulting solid was allowed to air dry for 24 h before use.
No further purification is needed. Yields: 0.49 g (2.2 mmol, 11%)
of TATP 7. Rf: 0.74 (10%
EA/Hex); 1H NMR (400 MHz): δ 1.49 (s, 18H); 13C NMR (100 MHz): δ 21.44 (CH3), 107.62 (C);
IR: 2997, 2945, 1177. The spectra matched those in a previous report.26b

DADP (6)
Caution: See safety
note above.

DADP was prepared by a modification
of a reported
procedure.26b To a stirred sample of acetone
(1.2 g, 20 mmol) cooled to 0 °C was added 1.97 g (20 mmol) of
35% aq hydrogen peroxide used as received. The solution was diluted
with water (8 mL) and concentrated H2SO4 (4
mL) was then added slowly (over 2 min interval). The reaction was
allowed to warm up to room temperature and stirred for 48 h, resulting
in the formation of a white crystalline solid. The vacuum filtered
solid was washed with cold H2O (3 × 10 mL) and then
tried by drawing air through the mass for 1 h. The solid was allowed
to sit and dry in open air for 24 h, and was then used without further
purification. Yield: 0.68 g (4.6 mmol, 23%) of DADP 6. Rf: 0.74 (10% EA/Hex); 1H NMR: δ 1.38 (s, 6H), 1.82 (s, 6H); 13C NMR: δ
20.65 (CH3), 22.55 (CH3), 107.67 (C); IR: 3000,
2295, 1196. The spectra matched a previous report.26b

t-Butyl 1-Phenyl-2-methyl-2-propyl
peroxide
(7)
t-Butyl 1-phenyl-2-methyl-2-propyl
peroxide (7) was prepared using a reported procedure.2b Spectra matched those previously reported.

Methyl 1-Phenyl-2-methyl-2-propyl peroxide (8)
Methyl 1-phenyl-2-methyl-2-propyl peroxide (8) was
prepared using a variation on reported procedures.30,43

1-Phenyl-2-methyl-2-propyl hydroperoxide was prepared
through an adaptation of reported procedures:30,43 1-phenyl-2-methyl-2-propanol (3.1 mL, 20 mmol, 1 equiv), hydrogen
peroxide (50 v/v % H2O, 2.3 mL, 40 mmol, 2 equiv), and
phosphoric acid (85%, 5.8 mL, 100 mmol, 5 equiv) were combined in
a round-bottom flask backfilled with nitrogen. The reaction was heated
to 45 °C for 5 h at which point the reaction was deemed complete
by disappearance of starting material (TLC). The reaction mixture
was cooled to room temperature and diluted with Hex (150 mL). The
separated organic layer was washed with deionized water (2 ×
10 mL) and brine (1 × 10 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, and
concentrated in vacuo. The resulting thick and dark oil was purified
by silica column chromatography (1.9 × 30.5 cm) with 5% EA in
Hex to furnish, following concentration in vacuo, 2.192 g (66%) of
the hydroperoxide as a light yellow oil. Rf: 0.40 (10% EA/Hex); IR (thin film): 3399 (br), 2981 (m), 1453 (s)
cm–1; 1H NMR: δ 1.22 (s, 6H), 2.90
(s, 2H), 7.24 (br m, 5H); 13C NMR: δ 24.0, 44.6,
83.2, 126.4, 128.1, 130.6, 137.7.

The tertiary hydroperoxide
(0.3329 g, 2.0 mmol, 1 equiv), methyl
iodide (0.37 mLl, 6 mmol, 3 equiv), and THF (10 mL, 0.2 M) were combined
in a flame-dried round-bottom flask backfilled with nitrogen. Potassium tert-butoxide (0.2470 g, 2.2 mmol, 1.1 equiv) was added
to the clear solution, and the resulting reaction was stirred at room
temperature until the starting material could no longer be observed
(TLC, 18 h). The reaction was quenched with saturated NH4Cl (50 mL) and extracted with EA (3 × 10 mL). The combined organic
layers were washed with brine (1 × 10 mL), dried over sodium
sulfate, and concentrated in vacuo to give an oily residue. The mixture
was purified by column chromatography (1.9 × 20 cm) with 1% EA
in Hex to furnish, following concentration in vacuo, 0.2389 g (66%)
of the dialkyl peroxide as a clear oil which smelled lightly of apples/pears. Rf: 0.78 (10% EA/Hex); IR (thin film): 2980 (s),
2929 (s), 2891 (s), 1464 (s) cm–1; 1H
NMR: δ 1.19 (s, 6H), 2.87 (s, 2H), 3.85 (s, 3H), 7.23 (br m,
5H); 13C NMR: δ 24.3, 45.0, 63.1, 82.6, 126.3, 128.0,

Reduction
Procedure Using Thiolate Generated via Deprotonation
This
example describes the reduction of peroxide 3; the same
procedure was applied to other substrates: into 10 mL
of THF is dissolved 0.118 g (1.06 mmol) of KOtBu,
or, alternatively, 0.107 g (1.06 mmol) of Et3N. To this
solution 0.116 g (1.06 mmol) of phenyl thiol is added, followed by
0.201 g (0.964 mmol) of peroxide 3. The reaction was
monitored by TLC for disappearance of peroxide using N,N′-dimethyl-p-phenylenediamine
as a redox-active indicator;34 for most
substrates, progress of reactions could also be followed using more
conventional oxidizing TLC indicators.

Control Reactions with
Base
Control reactions with
base employed the same procedure outlined above for reactions with
thiolate and base but omitted the thiol. Reactions were monitored
by TLC and/or NMR.

Reductive Generation of Thiolate
This example describes
the reduction of peroxide 3; the same procedure was applied
to other substrates: in 10 mL of EtOH, 0.230 g (1.056 mmol) of diphenyl
sulfide is dissolved. Then, 0.72 mL (1.44 mmol) of a solution of LiBH4 in THF (nominally 2 M) is added slowly. Once bubbling ceased,
0.201 g (0.964 mmol) of dialkyl peroxide 3 was added
slowly. Disappearance of peroxide was monitored by TLC as described
previously.34

Control Reaction Using
Only Peroxide and LiBH4
Control reaction using
only peroxide and LiBH4 was accomplished
as in the preceding example except that the disulfide was omitted.

General Thiol/Fe Reduction Procedure
The procedure
is exemplified for the reduction of peroxide 3.

To a solution of 0.0051 g (0.024 mmol) of FeBr2 in 5 mL
of THF is added 0.10 g (0.48 mmol) dialkyl peroxide 3. At this point, the solution is typically clear with a light orange
to light red coloration. Addition of 0.052 mL (0.48 mmol) of thiophenol
results in the immediate formation of a black colloidal suspension.
The reaction can be followed by disappearance of peroxide substrate
(TLC) as described previously;34 in most
cases, the reactions are complete in less than 60 s. The solutions
from reactions employing stoichiometric thiol, even if remaining dark
and opaque upon disappearance of substrate (TLC), will clear to a
light-to-dark green solution within a few minutes.

Reactions
in CD3CN were conducted in an identical manner
but were monitored by both TLC and by 1H NMR of crude aliquots.

Thiol/Fe Reduction of TATP
To a solution of 0.0100
g (0.047 mmol) of FeBr2 in 3 mL of CD3CN was
added 0.110 g (0.47 mmol) of TATP (5), followed by addition
of 0.160 g (1.41 mmol) of phenyl thiol. The black suspension was allowed
to stir for 3 days after which 0.043 g (0.470 mmol) of toluene is
added as an internal standard. An aliquot drawn from the solution
was then analyzed by NMR.

Control Reaction Using Only Peroxide and
Iron
A control
reaction of FeBr2 and peroxide was conduced as for the
Fe/thiol procedures described above except that thiol was omitted.
Reactions were monitored by TLC, as described previously, and/or NMR.

General Procedure for Fe/Thiol-Promoted Reduction of DADP
To a solution of 0.0072 g (0.034 mmol) of FeBr2 in 2
mL of CD3CN is added 0.10 g (0.68 mmol) of DADP (6), followed by addition of 0.129 g (1.35 mmol) of thiophenol.
The reaction is allowed to sit for 3 min, and then, 0.062 g (0.6755
mmol) of toluene is added. The entire solution is then analyzed by 1H NMR, comparing the integration of the signals for toluene
(2.33 ppm) versus acetone (2.08 ppm).

Radical Clock Experiment
(See Also Scheme 4)
The general thiol/Fe reduction
procedure was applied to a solution of peroxide 8 (0.100
g, 0.562 mmol) in CD3CN (3.0 mL). 1H NMR was
recorded on the crude reaction mixture. Four major products were observed
(Figure S4). As a first approximation,
we assume that all products are derived from the alkoxy radical, either
through hydrogen atom transfer or reduction (to form the alcohol)
or fragmentation to afford acetone, plus either toluene or the benzyl
phenyl sulfane (see Scheme 4). The tertiary alcohol was quantified by isolation; we note
that the isolated yield and the relative yield calculated from the
NMR assay are very similar. With the exception of acetone, the products
could also be detected by GC/MS (not shown).(1) 2-Methyl-1-phenylpropan-2-ol
(14%),
which has been previously characterized,56 was quantified by the 1H NMR singlets at 2.74 (2H) and
1.15 ppm (6H). This product was also isolated (extraction, chromatography)
in 13% yield.

(2) Acetone
(87%) was quantified by the 1H NMR singlet (6H) at 2.10
ppm.

(3) Toluene (24%)
was quantified by the 1H NMR singlet (3H) at 2.35 ppm.

(4) The benzyl (phenyl) sulfane
(62%),
which has been previously characterized,57 was quantified by the integration of the 1H NMR singlet
(2H), at 4.19 ppm.



Thiol/Fe Catalyzed Reduction
Using Added Hydride
To
a solution of 0.005 g (0.024 mmol) of FeBr2 in 10 mL of
THF is added 0.050 g (0.24 mmol) of dialkyl peroxide 3 (transferred from preweighed vial in minimum amount of THF) followed
by 0.48 mL (0.024 mmol) of phenyl thiol in THF stock solution (nominally
0.05 M) and last 0.24 mL (0.24 mmol) of a solute of DIBAL in THF (nominally
1.0 M). The resulting light red/light green reaction was allowed to
sir for 5 min, during which time the solution became translucent with
very light red/green color. TLC analysis confirmed the disappearance
of the peroxide and the formation of 3-phenyl-1-propanol.

Reaction Calorimetry
for Fe/SPh-Catalyzed Decomposition of DADP
(6)
Caution: see notes above related
to dangers of the acetone peroxides.

In a glass vial with a
septum cap is placed 0.021 g (0.10 mmol) of FeBr2 and 0.150
g (1.01 mmol) of DADP 6. The vial is placed under an
atmosphere of N2 and then wrapped with several layers of
a PIG cloth mat. THF (4.0 mL) is added to the vial. A metal temperature
probe (Fisher Scientific, Traceable, uncalibrated) is inserted through
the septum into the solution. After the solution temperature has stabilized
(22.1 °C), a solution of 0.011 g (0.101 mmol) of phenyl thiol
in 1 mL THF is added to the solution all at once, resulting in an
observed temperature rise to 27.2 °C. This value corresponded
to a heat of reaction of 15.4 kcal/mol, which was rounded to 15 kcal/mol
given experimental uncertainties.

Reaction Calorimetry for
Fe/SR Cleavage of a Dialkyl Peroxide
in THF
Calorimetry was conducted as in the previous experiment
except that dialkyl peroxide 3 (0.208 g, 1.00 mmol) was
used as the peroxide substrate and the reaction vial was wrapped with
a 150 mm thickness of foam covering every part of the vial except
for the septum. A temperature rise from 24.5 to 32.7 °C was observed
over a period of 3.0 min.

Reaction Calorimetry of Fe/SR Cleavage of
a Dialkyl Peroxide
in CH3CN
Calorimetry was conducted as previously
using dialkyl peroxide 4 (0.200 g, 0.961 mmol) and acetonitrile
as solvent. A temperature rise from 22.9 to 33.6 °C was observed
over a 3.0 min period.
