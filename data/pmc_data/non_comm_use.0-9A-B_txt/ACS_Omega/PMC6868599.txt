The ability to write DNA code from
scratch will allow for the discovery
of new and interesting chemistries as well as allowing the rewiring
of cell signal pathways. Herein, we have utilized synthetic evolution
artificial intelligence (SYN-AI) to intelligently design a set of
14-3-3 docking genes. SYN-AI engineers synthetic genes utilizing a
parental gene as an evolution template. Wherein, evolution is fast-forwarded
by transforming template gene sequences to DNA secondary and tertiary
codes based upon gene hierarchical structural levels. The DNA secondary
code allows identification of genomic building blocks across an orthologous
sequence space comprising multiple genomes. Where, the DNA tertiary
code allows engineering of supersecondary structures. SYN-AI constructed
a library of 10 million genes that was reduced to three structurally
functional 14-3-3 docking genes by applying natural selection protocols.
Synthetic protein identity was verified utilizing Clustal Omega sequence

The conservation of allosteric communications was confirmed utilizing
elastic and anisotropic network models. Whereby, we utilized elNemo

14-3-3 docking genes to be written from scratch.

1 Introduction
The
ability to write DNA code from scratch is a primary goal in
the area of synthetic biology. Wherein, intelligent gene design will
allow researchers to address a broad range of scientific conundrums
such as the rewiring of signal pathways and the intelligent design
of small genomes. Thusly, allowing for the engineering of novel organisms
and the potential for new and interesting chemistries that may include
degradation of nonbiodegradable products. Saliently, these technologies
will open frontiers in medicine allowing the design of novel drug
receptors for the discovery of new cancer and disease treatments.
The possibilities that such a technology can offer are seemingly endless
and essential for our current technological challenges. It is worth
mentioning that over the past decade, there have been multiple attempts
at the modest ambition of de novo protein engineering. Wherein, the
science was limited to a range of mutagenesis techniques that often
resulted in nonfunctional proteins. Although, there has been considerable
progress, the ability to intelligently design fully functional genes
from scratch has been elusive.

In the current study, we focus
on the intelligent gene design utilizing
synthetic evolution artificial intelligence (SYN-AI), an AI that accelerates
the evolution process by performing a domain shuffling-like mechanism
similar to the “Domain Lego” principle.1−3 Evolutional acceleration is achieved by transforming gene sequences
into DNA secondary (DSEC) and tertiary codes (DTER) based on gene
hierarchical structure levels. We assume that modern genes have a
common ancestor that partitioned over time via DNA crossovers, and
that genetic diversity occurred by processes such as gene duplication,
inversion, insertion, and deletion.4,5 Our assumption
of a common ancestor is in agreement with the “Universal Ancestor”
and LUCA “Last Universal Common Ancestor” models.6,7 Saliently, the DSEC allows for the identification of short highly
conserved sequences occurring across multiple genomes referred to
herein as genomic building blocks (GBBs). Based upon “The Fundamental
Theory of the Evolution Force”, these sequences are genetic
artifacts formed during the evolution process.71 The DTER allows partitioning of genes at the supersecondary
structure level. Whereby, synthetic genes are engineered by walking
the DTER followed by random selection and ligation of supersecondary
structures. Thusly, the exchange of information is analogous to the
swapping of genomic building blocks in a game of Legos.

To fast
forward the evolution process, SYN-AI forms an expanse
orthologous sequence space followed by an exponential number of DNA
crossovers within the genomic alphabet comprising the DNA secondary
code. SYN-AI identifies genomic building block formation across genomes
by analysis of evolution force associated with DNA crossovers. Whereby,
evolution force is a compulsion acting at the matter–energy
interface that accomplishes genetic diversity while simultaneously
conserving architecture and function.71 In the current study, we utilize SYN-AI to intelligently design
a set of 14-3-3 docking genes. These genes are responsible for regulating
protein–protein interactions (PPI) in cell signal pathways.
Saliently, docking protein interactions can have a profound effect
on the target protein, altering its localization, stability, conformation,
phosphorylation state, activity, and/or molecular interactions.9 Thusly, the ability to write 14-3-3 docking genes
from scratch will allow the rewiring of cell signal pathways. In addition
to acting as key components of cell signal pathways, 14-3-3 docking
proteins play a role in cell growth and development, cancer cell signaling,9,10 cellular metabolism, and organelle communication.11 Whereby, 14-3-3 proteins have been shown to interact with
key signaling components such as the insulin-like growth receptor,57−59 PI3K,60,61 cdc25 phosphatase,62−64 and bad.65−67

In the current study, we intelligently designed a set of 14-3-3
docking genes utilizing SYN-AI. Wherein, a truncated B. taurus 14-3-3 ζ docking gene was utilized
as a template for gene engineering. Genomic building blocks were identified
across multiple genomes by partitioning the parental docking gene
into a DNA secondary code and simulating evolution by performing an
exponential number of DNA crossovers within the genomic alphabet forming
the DSEC, Figure 1 (top).
Whereby, DNA crossover partners were randomly selected across an orthologous
sequence space. Synthetic supersecondary structures were engineered
by targeting evolution within the genomic alphabet comprising the
DNA tertiary code, Figure 1 (middle). In all, SYN-AI generated a library of 10 million
genes by walking the DTER, followed by random selection and ligation
of synthetic supersecondary structures, Figure 1 (bottom). This expanse gene library was
reduced to three genes utilizing natural selection protocols. Synthetic
14-3-3 docking genes were confirmed utilizing the Clustal Omega multiple
sequence alignment tool and by phylogenetic analysis utilizing Phylogeny.fr.
We were able to confirm the three-dimensional structure of synthetic
proteins utilizing I-TASSER as well as verify conservation of small-molecule
and fusicoccin binding sites utilizing Cofactor and Coach. The conservation
of the 14-3-3 ζ amphipathic groove57 as well as allosteric interactions were confirmed utilizing the
elastic network model. Whereby, we utilized ElNemo and ANM2.1 to analyze
normal modes, root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), and deformation energies.
Notably, based upon the aforementioned, we confirm the intelligent
design of a set of novel 14-3-3 docking proteins utilizing the synthetic
evolution artificial intelligence.

Figure 1 SYN-AI mechanism. SYN-AI partitions the
parental gene into a DNA
secondary code (DSEC) and fast forwards the evolution process by performing
an exponential number of DNA crossovers within each genomic alphabet
comprising the DSEC, (Top). DNA crossovers characterized by the highest
magnitude of evolution force are selected and stored in libraries.
Subsequently, genomic building block (GBB) libraries are subjected
to natural selection. Following natural selection, synthetic supersecondary
structures are formed by random selection and ligation of GBBs from
appropriate genomic alphabet libraries, (Middle). Synthetic genes
are engineered by walking the DNA tertiary code (DTER) followed by
random selection and ligation of synthetic supersecondary structures.
Gene libraries are restricted to functional 14-3-3 docking genes by
a natural selection process (Bottom).

2 Results
SYN-AI identified genomic building
block formation by performing
an exponential number of DNA crossovers within the genomic alphabet
forming the DSEC followed by the analysis of the magnitude of the
evolution force associated with the aforementioned. Whereby, evolution
force was analyzed over single and multidimensional planes of evolution
formed as functions of the four evolution engines, (i) evolution conservation,
(ii) wobble, (iii) DNA binding state, and (iv) periodicity according
to “The Fundamental Theory of the Evolution Force” and
as described in ref (71). In addition, genomic building blocks were identified by applying
natural selection protocols that limited selection to evolutionarily
conserved DNA crossovers utilizing pattern recognition filters and
that limited selection to sequences comprised of naturally occurring
mutations utilizing Blosum80 mutation frequency-based algorithms.
Subsequently, SYN-AI-engineered synthetic 14-3-3 docking genes by
walking the DNA tertiary code and randomly selecting and ligating
synthetic supersecondary structures formed by Domain Legos shuffling
of genomic building blocks. Whereby, SYN-AI limited selection to structurally
functional 14-3-3 docking genes by application of natural selection
protocols.

Evolution force was analyzed utilizing the rotation
model, as described
in71 and as illustrated in Figure 2. Wherein, genomic building
blocks appeared as low-density occurrences displaying (+) molecular
wobble and high magnitude moments of inertia about the evolutional
axis. In identifying genomic building blocks, SYN-AI analyzed evolution
force across single and multidimensional planes formed by the four
evolution engines. Evolution force distribution across a one-dimensional
evolution plane is illustrated in Figure 2. Where, evolution force associated with
genomic building block formation was analyzed within genomic alphabets
(1–4) of the parental bovine 14-3-3 docking gene DNA secondary
code.

Figure 2 Analysis of evolution force utilizing the rotation model. Evolution
force was evaluated in genomic alphabets (1–4) of the parental
bovine brain 14-3-3 docking gene DNA secondary code. Evolution force
was evaluated as described in ref (71).

Protein identity was assessed by aligning synthetic docking
genes
with the truncated B. taurus 14-3-3
ζ docking gene utilizing the Clustal Omega multiple sequence
alignment tool.12 Synthetic proteins displayed
58.5 to 71.5 percent identity to the parental sequence characterized
by stretches of high sequence identity between residues 100 and 130
and residues 154 and 180, Figure 3A. Phylogenetic analysis was performed utilizing Phylogeny.fr.13,14 Saliently, SYN-AI-1 and SYN-AI-2 diverged from the parental bovine
gene forming novel 14-3-3 gene families. SYN-AI-3 was most closely
related to the parental bovine 14-3-3 docking gene. However, each
of the synthetic genes displayed significant branch distance from
the parental gene, Figure 3B. We also performed phylogeny.fr blast, Figure 4. Notably, each synthetic protein
was characterized by distinctive phylogenetic relationships. Whereby,
SYN-AI-1 was most closely related to 14-3-3 protein zeta/delta of Ophiophagus hannah and Anolis carolinensis. The aforementioned phylogenetic relationships were characterized
by score: 281 bits (718), expect: 7e-73, identities: 150/213 (70%),
and positives: 165/213 (77%). SYN-AI-2 also displayed close identity
to the aforementioned but with greater divergence. Wherein, the relationship
was characterized by alignment score: 266 bits (679), expect: 2e-68,
identities: 142/212 (66%), and positives: 156/212 (73%). Saliently,
SYN-AI-3 exhibited close phylogenetic relationship to protein zeta/delta
of Ovis aries and the parental B. taurus 14-3-3 ζ docking protein characterized
by an alignment score: 281 bits (719), expect: 5e-73, identities:
149/213 (69%), and positives: 169/213 (79%).

Three-dimensional structure of the synthetic protein was
analyzed
utilizing the I-TASSER suite, Zhang Laboratory University of Michigan.
Structural analysis revealed that synthetic proteins conserved the
14-3-3 ζ architecture and surface as well as conserving volume
of the ligand-binding site, Figure 5. SYN-AI-3 folded at the highest confidence characterized
by a C-score of 1.54 and a resolution of 2.5 ± 1.9 Å. However,
I-TASSER structural predictions of all three synthetic proteins were
very reliable wherein synthetic proteins folded at an average C-score
of 1.51. Saliently, the truncated parental 14-3-3 ζ docking
protein folded at a similar confidence score of 1.55 with a TM-score
of 0.93 ± 0.06 and a RMSD of 2.5 ± 1.9 Å. In addition,
SYN-AI-1 and SYN-AI-3 were characterized by a TM-score of 0.93 ±
0.06 compared to SYN-AI-2 that was characterized by a TM-Score of
0.92 ± 0.06. Further, SYN-AI-1 and SYN-AI-3 were predicted at
an RMSD of 2.5 ± 1.9 Å wherein SYN-AI-2 was predicted at
an RMSD of 2.6 ± 1.9 Å.

at a confidence of 1.48 and a resolution 2.6 ± 1.9 Å (D).

Synthetic protein–ligand-binding
interactions were analyzed
utilizing Cofactor and Coach. Notably, SYN-AI successfully conserved
fungal toxin fusicoccin complex (FC) binding within the BS03 site
of SYN-AI-3, Figure 6 (top left). The aforementioned was predicted at a confidence score
of 0.40 and a resolution of 2.74 Å. Wherein, FC binding within
parental bovine 14-3-3 docking protein was predicted at a slightly
higher confidence of 0.45. The aforementioned analysis revealed that
fusicoccin ligand–residue interactions were conserved with
exception of N42 → V42 and V46 → A46 mutations. Fusicoccin
formed hydrogen bonding interactions with residues V42, A46, K120,
M121, P165, I166, and D213 and Van der Waals interaction with F117
of the synthetic protein amphipathic groove Figure 6 (Top Right). Whereby, the FC complex formed
bonding interactions with the residue V42 at a distance of 0.285 nm,
A46 at 0.375 nm, F117 at 0.223 nm, K120 at 0.357 nm, M121 at 0.306
nm, P165 at 0.332 nm, I166 at 0.300 nm, and residue D213 at 0.353
nm. Compared to the parental 14-3-3 docking protein, where fusicoccin
formed bonding interactions with the residue N42 at a distance of
0.41 nm, V46 at 0.353 nm, F117 at 0.267 nm, K120 at 0.322 nm, M121
at 0.333 nm, P165 at 0.332 nm, I166 at 0.285 nm, and residue D213
at a distance of 0.42 nm. Notably, the FC complex ligand-binding site
was fully conserved in SYN-AI-1, Figure 7. Where, fusicoccin formed bonding interactions
with the residue N42 at a distance of 0.354 nm, V46 at 0.27 nm, F117
at 0.213 nm, K120 at 0.333 nm, M121 at 0.287 nm, P165 at 0.33 nm,
I166 at 0.379 nm, and D213 at a distance of 0.386 nm. Comparatively,
synthetic protein SYN-AI-2 conserved the fusicoccin ligand-binding
site except V46 → A46 mutation, Figure 7. Whereby, fusicoccin formed bonding interactions
with the residue N42 at a distance of 0.222 nm, A46 at 0.445 nm, F117
at 0.282 nm, K120 at 0.320 nm, M121 at 0.344 nm, P165 at 0.329 nm,

In addition to conserving
FC complex ligand–residue interactions,
synthetic evolution artificial intelligence conserved small molecule
(2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl) pyrrolidine ligand binding within the BS02
site, Figure 6 (Bottom).
Wherein, Cofactor and Coach predicted the binding of the small molecule
within the SYN-AI-3 BS02 site at a resolution of 1.7 Å. Our analysis
revealed that the SYN-AI-3 BS02 ligand-binding site comprised N42
→ V42, S45 → A45, and V46 → A46 mutations. Further,
the analysis of ligand–residue interactions within the SYN-AI-3
BS02 site revealed that (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl) pyrrolidine interacts
with the residue V42 at a distance of 0.264 nm, A45 at 327 nm, A46
at 0.391 nm, F117 at 0.252 nm, and the residue K120 at a distance
of 0.397 nm. Comparatively, (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl) binding within
the parental bovine 14-3-3 docking protein BS02 site was characterized

at 0.268 nm, F117 at 0.282 nm, and the residue K120 at a distance
of 0.366 nm. Notably, synthetic protein SYN-AI-1 displayed full conservation
of the BS02 ligand-binding site. Whereby, (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl)
pyrrolidine interacted with the residue N42 at a distance of 0.261
nm, S45 at 0.273 nm, V46 at 0.270 nm, F117 at 0.250 nm, and the residue
K120 at a distance of 0.385 nm.

Notably, synthetic evolution
artificial intelligence successfully
conserved protein–protein interactions, as corroborated by
Coach and Cofactor analyses of BS01 and BS02 ligand-binding sites.
Whereby, test probe I (TMLNLVSGRRR) was occupied and was deeply buried
within BS01 and BS02 ligand-binding sites, Figure 8 (Top Left). Test probe I ligand interaction
was predicted at 2.74 Å with a C-score of 0.31. Whereby, the
probe interacted with residues H38, K41, V42, A45, A46, R56, R60,
F117, K120, R127, Y128, P165, I166, G169, L172, N173, V176, and E180
of the synthetic protein amphipathic grove, Figure 8 (Top right). Test probe II (VTYSG) binding
within the BS01 site was predicted at a C-score of 0.82 and at a resolution
of 2.3 Å, Figure 8 (Bottom Left). Whereby, probe II interacted with residues K49, R56,
R60, K120, R127, Y128, L172, V176, and E180 of the amphipathic grove, Figure 8 (Bottom Right).
Saliently, synthetic evolution artificial intelligence accomplished
full conservation of BS01 ligand-binding residues within synthetic
protein SYN-AI-3 except a K49 → A49 mutation as well as an
additional G169 residue contact. Comparatively, synthetic protein
SYN-AI-1 displayed full conservation of ligand–residue interactions
with the addition of the G169 residue contact. Whereby, SYN-AI-2 comprised
K49 → A49 and R56 → A56 mutations in addition to the
G169 contact.

To demonstrate SYN-AI’s
ability to conserve protein allosteric
effects, we analyzed parental and SYN-AI engineered 14-3-3 ζ
docking proteins utilizing the elastic network model. Whereby, truncated
parental and synthetic structures were predicted utilizing I-TASSER.
ElNemo68,69 was utilized to perform the normal mode
analysis, Figure 9.
Normal mode analysis resulted in 107 modes, of which five (7–11)
were low-frequency modes indicating a role in ligand binding and intraprotein
communication. Saliently, Cα strains within synthetic proteins
were similar to those occurring within the parental docking protein,
as shown in Figure 9A. Whereby, mode 7 was characterized by a mean residue sample variance
of σ2 = 2.62 × 10–4. Residue
root mean square deviations of synthetic proteins also closely overlapped
the parental 14-3-3 ζ docking protein, Figure 9B. When comparing RMSD of parental 14-3-3
ζ docking protein to synthetic proteins, there exists a miniscule
variance of σ2 = 1.115 × 10–4 Å. Normal mode analysis also revealed that the frequency and
collectivity of synthetic protein modes closely mirrored those of
the parental 14-3-3 ζ docking protein, Figure 9C,D. The frequency of synthetic modes was
characterized by a variance of σ2 = 0.202 from the
parental docking protein. Wherein, synthetic proteins were characterized
by a variance in the collectivity of σ2 = 9.593 ×
10–3 from parental 14-3-3 ζ. The anisotropic
network model ANM2.170 was utilized to
analyze energy deformation and solvent accessibility. Synthetic protein
energy deformation peak pattern and strength were analogous to that
of the parental protein with a strong deformation peak ranging from
residues 43–106 as well as residues 127–148, Figure 10A–D. Notably,
energy deformation peaks correlate well with the location of the 14-3-3
ζ amphipathic groove as well as ligand-binding residues predicted
by I-TASSER. Wherein, the strong peak at residue 127 suggests a significant
role of the Van der Waal interaction with arginine in ligand-binding,
in both the parental and synthetic proteins. Synthetic protein solvent
accessibility also overlapped with that of the parental protein with
little variation per residue, as illustrated in Figure 10E.

Figure 9 Analysis of allosteric
interactions. ElNemo was utilized to perform
normal mode analysis of parental 14-3-3 ζ and synthetic proteins
SYN-AI-1, SYN-AI-2, and SYN-AI-3. Whereby, we analyzed carbon α
strain (A), root mean square deviation (B), mode frequency (C), mode
collectivity (D).

Figure 10 Analysis of amphipathic
groove. Conservation of the 14-3-3 ζ
amphipathic groove was confirmed by the anisotropic model, as described
in (70). Whereby, ANM2.1
was utilized to analyze energy deformations occurring in the parental
14-3-3 ζ docking protein (A), SYN-AI-1 (B), SYN-AI-2, (C) and
synthetic protein SYN-AI-3 (D). To further verify the conservation
of the amphipathic groove, ANM2.1 was also utilized to predict parental
and synthetic 14-3-3 ζ docking protein solvent accessibility
(E).

3 Discussion
In the
current study, we utilized SYN-AI to design a set of 14-3-3
docking proteins utilizing B. taurus 14-3-3 ζ docking protein as a parental template. Notably,
SYN-AI is not a rational design technology but simulates evolution
by evaluating evolution force associated with genomic building block
formation and subsequently builds genes from scratch by randomly assembling
the aforementioned. Our approach anticipates the evolution process
by simulating DNA shuffling. Thusly, SYN-AI is advantageous in engineering
functional genes, as anticipatory evolution has been shown to generate
functional proteins with high efficacy.74 Evolution force was solved by overlapping gene sequences occurring
over an orthologue sequence space with that of the parental template.
Thereby, SYN-AI is able to analyze the evolutional character of DNA
crossovers going back to “LUCA”. It is worth mentioning
that our technology is limited by its dependence on the availability
of PDB structural data. In the current study, crystal data was available
for 228 of 245 B. taurus 14-3-3 ζ
residues. Further, these crystal data contained gaps wherein the STRIDE
structure-based analysis was able to generate structural data for
213 of the 228 residues. Thusly, SYN-AI protein engineering was limited
to the available empirical data, whereby we showed the potential of
our technology for gene and signal pathway engineering by synthesizing
a set of truncated 14-3-3 docking proteins of 214 residues.

According to “The Fundamental theory of the Evolution Force”,
we were able to analyze evolution force associated with genomic building
block formation based upon four evolution engines, (i) evolution conservation,
(ii) wobble, (iii) DNA binding state, and (iv) periodicity. Molecular
biologists have long utilized evolution conservation as a tool when
selecting mutable gene regions. Where, it has been assumed that highly
evolutionarily conserved residues are critical to protein function.15−23 Thusly, SYN-AI is based upon the hypothesis that evolution conservation
is an artifact of the evolution force. Classically, wobble has been
defined by genetic diversity in the third codon with the conservation
of the residue sequence.24−30 However, in fingerprinting the evolution force we expanded the definition
of wobble to the acquisition of genetic diversity with the conservation
of architecture. Thusly, allowing wobble to be viewed at all structural
levels. For instance, supersecondary structures such as helices, turns,
and β sheets are expressed in genetically diverse species yet
retain basic architecture and function. A further example of wobble
at a higher structural level is that of bipedal animals. Although
the aforementioned are genetically diverse, anatomical structure and
the architecture are reserved across species. Also when constructing
SYN-AI, we assumed that evolution force interacts at the matter–energy
interface via DNA crossovers. Thusly, we were able to evaluate the
interaction of the evolution force at the matter–energy interface
by analyzing DNA binding states. Wherein, DNA binding states measure
DNA crossover selectivity in respect to the recombinant pool and are
a function of Gibb’s free energy associated with DNA base stacking
interactions.8,31−33 The final evolution
engine we considered was periodicity. We assumed that nature has a
tendency to repeat successful structures that promote the survival
of an organism. Thereby, evolution force at the molecular level is
a function of sequence periodicity.34−36

In the current
study, we have demonstrated that genomic building
blocks can be identified across multiple genomes by analyzing evolution
force and exploited to write genes from scratch. Wherein, by transforming
a parental gene template into DNA secondary and tertiary codes based
on hierarchical structure levels, SYN-AI was able to fast-forward
the evolution process. The aforementioned allowed the identification
of genomic building blocks by characterization of evolution force
and allowed for intelligent gene design by a Legos-like swapping of
genetic material in agreement with the Domain Lego principle.1−3 Notably, SYN-AI generated synthetic proteins displaying high sequence
identity to naturally occurring 14-3-3 docking proteins suggesting
that the AI successfully simulated the evolution process allowing
divergence from the parental 14-3-3 ζ docking gene while evolutionarily
conserving 14-3-3 global architecture. We were able to corroborate
the aforementioned by performing phylogeny.fr blast and established
that each synthetic protein comprised of diverse phylogenetic relationships
as characterized by diverse phylogenetic trees. Synthetic proteins
also displayed significant branch distance from one another further
confirming that SYN-AI fast-forwarded the evolution process. Wherein,
each synthetic protein diverged into a different evolutional pathway.
Saliently, despite performing ∼300 million DNA crossovers within
genomic alphabet comprising the 14-3-3 DNA secondary code, Clustal
Omega sequence alignments of synthetic proteins were characterized
by stretches of high sequence identity wherein no genetic diversity
was accomplished by SYN-AI. Notably, the aforementioned corroborates
that our natural selection protocols implemented into SYN-AI successfully
conserved slow evolving regions of genes. Saliently, the resistance
of these regions to mutation suggests that they are essential to cellular
function.37−39

In addition to fast-forwarding the evolution
process, SYN-AI successfully
conserved the 14-3-3 docking protein architecture. Whereby, I-TASSER
three-dimensional structural analysis revealed that global 14-3-3
docking protein architecture was conserved in all three synthetic
proteins. Based on molecular dynamics simulation data in conjunction
with previously discussed phylogenetic data, we validate our hypothesis
of evolution force effects on genomic building block formation by
proof-of-concept. Further corroborating our proof-of-concept, SYN-AI
evolutionarily conserved ligand-binding sites and ligand–residue
interactions. Notably, analysis by Coach and Cofactor40 confirmed that SYN-AI conserved small-molecule binding
as demonstrated by the conservation of (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl) pyrrolidine
binding within the BS02 site. While conserving small-molecule binding,
synthetic evolution accomplished significant modification of the SYN-AI-3
BS02 ligand-binding site. As characterized by mutation of three of
the five residues participating in the binding of (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl)
pyrrolidine. SYN-AI successfully altered positioning and conformation
of the molecule within the binding site. Contrary to SYN-AI-3, synthetic
protein SYN-AI-1 was characterized by full conservation of the BS02
binding site. Wherein, the artificial intelligence preserved parental
ligand–residue interactions. Saliently, conformation and positioning
of (2S)-2-(2-methoxyethyl) pyrrolidine within the SYN-AI-1 BS02 ligand-binding
site was altered due to changes in binding groove volume. As a result
of the modification of global protein architecture due to the evolution
process. The aforementioned is corroborated by phylogenetic analysis.
Wherein, SYN-AI-1 is significantly diverged from parental bovine brain
14-3-3 docking protein in comparison to synthetic protein SYN-AI-3.
Notably, the ability of synthetic evolution artificial intelligence
to evolutionarily conserve small molecule binding sites while altering
conformation and binding affinities of ligands is significant as small
molecules stabilize and inhibit 14-3-3 protein–protein interactions
that play a role in neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.41

Contrary to the surprising level of divergence
achieved in the
BS02 ligand-binding site, SYN-AI evolutionarily conserved amphipathic
interfaces and ligand-binding residues within the BS01 and BS03 ligand-binding
sites. Whereby, Coach and cofactor confirmed the conservation of fusicoccin
binding within all three synthetic proteins engineered utilizing synthetic
evolution artificial intelligence. Fusicoccin ligand–residue
interactions were also conserved with exception of N42 → V42
and V46 → A46 mutations. In agreement with our previous experiments,
modifications in global protein architecture altered the conformation
of fusicoccin within the amphipathic groove signifying that fusicoccin
exhibited an altered binding affinity for the ligand-binding site.
Notably, SYN-AI’s ability to evolutionarily conserve the FC
complex binding site is significant in that the complex is responsible
for activating H+ pumping across the plasma membrane.42 In plants, the interaction of the FC complex
with the 14-3-3 docking protein activates KAT1 channels and is responsible
for cell growth by regulating diffusion through K+ channels.43 Saliently, the FC 14-3-3 complex also regulates
defense responses in tomato plants.44 In
addition to conservation of the BS02 and BS03 sites, analysis of protein
probe localizations confirmed the conservation of the BS01 ligand-binding
site with exception of a K49 → A49 mutation and an additional
G169 residue contact. The aforementioned corroborates evolutional
conservation of protein–protein interactions in synthetic proteins.

Notably, altered positioning and conformation of small molecules,
protein probes, and the FC complex within synthetic protein BS01,
BS02, and BS03 sites substantiate our assumption that synthetic proteins
designed in this study display the potential for altered PPI. The
aforementioned is significant in that the interaction of globular
domains of protein interaction partners within the 14-3-3 amphipathic
grove regulates stress signaling proteins such as ERK, MAPK, JNK,
and p38 MAPK as well as growth and cell cycle regulators raf, PI3K,
and cdc25 phosphatase.45−49,61−67 We confirmed the conservation of these ligand-binding interactions
as well as confirmed the conservation of intraprotein communication
by analyzing allosteric effects utilizing the elastic network model.
Whereby, normal mode analysis of parental and synthetic 14-3-3 ζ
docking proteins was performed utilizing ElNemo and ANM2.1. The analysis
of mode 7 indicated that there existed little variance in Cα
strain occurring in parental 14-3-3 ζ and synthetic proteins.
These data suggest that synthetic proteins are energetically stable
and corroborate the validity of I-TASSER structure prediction. The
aforementioned are corroborated by RMSD results, wherein synthetic
proteins exhibited little variance from the parental 14-3-3 ζ
protein. Thusly, SYN-AI was able to evolve protein sequence and local
structures without disrupting the global protein architecture. Notably,
the aforementioned was accomplished while conserving mode frequency
and collectivity suggesting that there exist little variance in residue
potential energies during structural transitioning from parental to
synthetic 14-3-3 ζ proteins. This is prominent due to the many
ligand and signal pathway interactions occurring within the 14-3-3
ζ amphipathic groove, as corroborated by the presence of 107
modes indicated by ElNemo. Our data suggests that SYN-AI conserved
allosteric interactions regulating signal transduction pathways. The
conservation of the 14-3-3 ζ amphipathic groove is corroborated
by solvent accessibility data indicating only infinitesimal differences
in protein hydrophobicity. Notably, we demonstrate the conservation
of the binding of the R18 protein peptide within the amphipathic groove
as well as the conservation of a “hug and squeeze” mechanism.
Where, the left and right torso of the 14-3-3 monomer flex closed
and secured the R18 protein peptide in the amphipathic groove. The
open configuration is shown in Figure 11A,C and the closed configuration in Figure 11B,D. Notably, we
also successfully dimerized the SYN-AI-1 monomer and engineered a
functional 14-3-3 ζ dimer, while maintaining the “bend
and flex” mechanism present in the WT dimer, as illustrated
in Figure 12. Whereby,
we show the synthetic 14-3-3 ζ dimer in both the open and closed
positions. Modes 7–11 were also conserved in SYN-AI-generated
dimmers. We have demonstrated that SYN-AI conserved allosteric communications
in the monomeric form of the 14-3-3 ζ protein as well as low-frequency
vibrations occurring in the 14-3-3 ζ dimeric form, thusly validating
the identification of genomic building blocks by characterization
of evolution force.

utilized
to perform normal mode analysis. Low-frequency vibrations occurring

14-3-3 monomer was predicted utilizing COTH,73 Zhang Laboratory University of Michigan. The normal mode analysis
was performed utilizing ElNemo and graphics generated utilizing the
Jena3D Viewer. The open configuration of the Mode 7 bend and flex
mechanism is illustrated in (A), whereby the closed configuration
is shown in (B).

Saliently, our study
relies heavily on the accuracy of computational
structure prediction. However, our results are corroborated by the
parental 14-3-3 ζ structure reported in ref (57). Whereby, as an experimental
control, we overlapped the native 14-3-3 ζ crystal structure
with the I-TASSER-predicted PDB structure. As illustrated in Figure 13, the I-TASSER
14-3-3 ζ structure prediction is identical to the reported crystal
structure. Wherein, we utilized the SuperPose server72 to overlap the PDB structure reported in ref (57) to the I-TASSER-predicted
structure, with only minor deviations present in the coiled coil regions.
It is worth mentioning that this level of accuracy is not guaranteed
for all subsequent predictions performed in this study. However, the
claims presented herein are supported by sufficient scientific data
to corroborate the experimental controls and I-TASSER structure prediction
of synthetic proteins. Wherein, we can confidently conclude that SYN-AI
successfully engineered a set of functional 14-3-3 ζ docking
genes from scratch.

Figure 13 Superimposition of experimental and predicted 14-3-3 ζ
structures.
The SuperPose server was utilized to compare the native B. taurus 14-3-3 crystal structure reported in57 to the I-TASSER-predicted structure. The native
crystal structure covered residues 1–228 with two gaps of 5
and 7 amino acids, respectively. Superimposition of the parental and
synthetic proteins was performed with a minimum sequence similarity
of 25% identity, a similarity cutoff of RMSD of 2.0 Å, a dissimilarity
cutoff of RMSD of 3.0 Å, and a dissimilar subdomain cutoff of
7 residues.

According to Wang, mutations
to residues L172, V176, and L220 drastically
interrupted the interaction of 14-3-3 ζ with raf1 kinase, thusly
effecting the promotion of prosurvival by the docking protein. Although
our study does not focus on the role of 14-3-3 ζ on apoptosis,
L220 is located in the C′ terminal, thusly is truncated in
SYN-AI engineered docking proteins. In considering effects of mutation
on protein interaction, we note that in vivo 14-3-3 ζ forms
both a tetrameric complex comprised of a 14-3-3 ζ homodimer
and two serotonin N-acetyl transferase (AANAT) monomers
as well forms an octameric biological complex with AANAT. Of the two
complexes, inter-residue C-α strains are lower in the octameric
complex, suggesting that it is more thermodynamically stable and more
likely to occur in nature. The identical overlap of SYN-AI-engineered
and parental 14-3-3 ζ docking proteins allowed us to investigate
the effects of C′-terminal truncation by mutating rotamers
of the parental 14-3-3 ζ serotonin N-acetyl
transferase octameric complex utilizing UCSF Chimera.75,76 Rotamers were mutated to those characterizing SYN-AI-1, and residues
215−228 deleted from chains A through D of the biological complex.
To obtain a good structure, energy minimization was performed on each
chain of the octamer as reported in the Methods section. When analyzing hydrogen bonding, we find that the native
octameric complex is characterized by 40 hydrogen bond interactions
with conserved [RRHTLP] residues 28–33 of ovine AANAT. The
AANAT motif is similar to canonical motifs [RSXpSXP; RXY/FXpSXP].75 Notably, the SYN-AI-1 ζ biological complex
was characterized by 55 hydrogen bond interactions with the [RRHTLP]
motif, thusly displayed increased binding affinity. As illustrated
in Figure S1A, native B.
taurus 14-3-3 ζ C-terminal residues 215–228
(cyan) contribute two hydrogen bonds (circled white) between asparagine
224 and histidine 30 of the [RRHTLP] motif (green) within each 14-3-3
ζ AANAT ligand interaction. These hydrogen bond interactions
are lost in the SYN-AI-1 octameric complex. However, N-acetyl transferase is secured by alternate hydrogen bond formations
between the [RRHTLP] motif and SYN-AI-1 characterized by hydrogen
bond interactions between proline 33 and lysine 49, TPO 31 and arginine
56, arginine 29 and glutamate 180, as well as glycine 214 of SYN-AI-1
and arginine 89 of serotonin N-acetyl transferase, Figure S1B. The increase in binding affinity
in SYN-AI engineered 14-3-3 ζ opposed to the loss of function
reported in Fu76 is due to Fu intentionally
performing point mutations characterized by dissimilar residues, thusly
disallowing alternate hydrogen bond formations, as acceptor atoms
were conformationally blocked by the C′-terminal motif. By
doing so, Fu was able to block the promotion of prosurvival by 14-3-3
ζ and demonstrate the potential of mutated lines for treating
cancer. Contrarily, SYN-AI deleted the entire C′-terminal helix
allowing for conformational shift of serotonin N-acetyl
transferase within the binding pocket that led to alternative hydrogen
bond formations with adjacent α-helices located within the amphipathic
groove (Figure S1B, Table S1). Thusly,
allowing stable but modified hydrogen bonding between the [RRHTLP]
motif of serotonin N-acetyl transferase and SYN-AI-1
monomers. Modifications were not restricted to hydrogen bonding interactions
occurring with the [RRHTLP] motif but were seen globally throughout
the biological complex as AANAT formed 218 hydrogen bond interactions
within the biological complex Figure S2, compared to 145 hydrogen bond interactions within the native 14-3-3
ζ N-acetyl transferase complex. It is unfeasible
to analyze the effects of synthetic evolution over 130 14-3-3 ζ
protein interaction partners. However, it is safe to assume that the
effects of synthetic evolution are pathway sensitive and depend upon
the protein interaction partner.

4 Conclusions
Based upon our findings, SYN-AI was able to engineer genes from
scratch by identifying evolution force associated with genomic building
block formation as well as by applying natural selection protocols
that mimic those that occur in nature. The evidence reported herein
suggests that synthetic evolution methodologies are excellent tools
for the intelligent design of genes and should offer an alternative
to rational design approaches. Notably, SYN-AI technology may be expanded
allowing for the design of genomes at a very high resolution compared
to current technologies that are based on the exchange of very large
segments of genomic DNA. SYN-AI’s ability to write DNA code
from scratch at high resolution opens an endless potential for scientific
exploration and gene design that may be applied to the evolution of
any gene, dependent on the availability of PDB structural data. The
ability to write DNA code at a high resolution also allows the rewiring
of cell signal pathways. Saliently, SYN-AI synthetic evolution technology
explores multiple evolution pathways based on researcher’s
experimental parameters, whereby each pathway results in the formation
of an alternate gene or gene family dependent on the mutability of
the sequence space. As SYN-AI technology simulates evolution, outcomes
also rely on randomness, whereby under identical experimental parameters,
there exists a possibility of exploring a diverse evolution pathway.
Thusly, SYN-AI offers an excellent opportunity for the discovery of
new chemistries that have potential applications in the treatment
of cancer and other diseases as well as allow for the design of industrial
genes.

5 Methods
5.1 High-Performance Computing
SYN-AI
was performed utilizing the Stampede 2 supercomputer located at the
Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas. Experiments
were performed in the normal mode utilizing SKX compute nodes comprising
48 cores on two sockets with a processor base frequency of 2.10 GHz
and a max turbo frequency of 3.70 GHz. Each SKX node comprises 192
GB RAM at 2.67 GHz with 32 KB L1 data cache per core, 1 MB L2 per
core, and 33 MB L3 per socket. Each socket can cache up to 57 MB with
local storage of 144/tmp partition on a 200 GB SSD.

5.2 Simulating Evolution
5.2.1 Identification and Isolation
of Genomic
Building Blocks
SYN-AI analyzed evolution force associated
with genomic building block formation across an orthologous sequence
space comprising genes occurring at a homology threshold of >80
percent
identity to parental bovine brain 14-3-3 docking gene. The orthologous
sequence space comprised 2.5 × 106 bp of genetic material.
Evolution force was analyzed by transforming the bovine brain 14-3-3
docking gene into a DSEC and performing 3 × 108 DNA
crossovers within genomic alphabets. DNA hybridization partners were
randomly selected across orthologous sequence space. Evolution at
the matter–energy interface was simulated by performing DNA
hybridizations in a buffering solution of 3 mM Mg2+ and
1.2 mM dNTP at 328.15° kelvin.8 Gibb’s
free energy was calculated according to Owczarzy50 and a penalty assessed for DNA base pair mismatches.

Evolutionarily fit DNA crossovers were selected by applying natural
selection protocols. Neural networks limited selection to DNA crossovers
based upon Gibb’s free energy. Genomic building blocks were
passed through pattern recognition filters that removed sequences
displaying low sequence homology to the parental bovine brain 14-3-3
docking gene. The selection was limited to DNA crossover instances
comprising evolutionarily favored mutations by quantum-normalized
Blosum80 mutation frequency-based neural networks. Natural selection
was further accomplished by limiting selection to sequences characterized
by (+) molecular wobble vectors. Subsequently, genomic building block
libraries were constructed by quantum-normalized neural networks that
limited selection to DNA crossovers characterized by high magnitude
of evolution. Evolution force was enumerated over single and multidimensional
evolution planes, as described in ref (71).

5.2.2 Evaluation of Evolution
Force Associated
with Genomic Building Block Formation
Evolution force associated
with genomic building block formation was solved utilizing the rotation
model, as described in ref (71). Evolution force τϵ was solved as
a function of inertial moments Ic about
the evolution axis and molecular wobble, eq 1. Whereby, inertial vector Ic is a function of evolution conservation ϵ and
variance r from a recombinant pool comprising a total 3 × 108 DNA crossovers, eq 2. Evolution conservation ϵ was solved as a function
of DNA and protein evolution vectors (ϵDNAc, ϵProc), eq 3, and molecular wobble ωm likewise solved as a function of evolution vectors (ϵDNAc, ϵProc), eq 4. The aforementioned evolution vectors
are functions of DNA and protein similarity vectors (Xi, Xj) weighted by the recombinant pool, eqs 5 and 6. Whereby, evolution
weights (Wd, Wp) describe similarity of the recombinant pool to the parental sequence
in respect to DNA and protein primary sequence. Evolution weights
are a function of mean DNA μsDNA and mean protein μsPro evolution vectors, eqs 7 and 8. Wherein, μsDNA and μsPro were solved by summation of genomic building block (GBB)
similarity functions (Xi/n, Xj/n) occurring across the orthologue sequence space
(sspacer) divided by the total number
of DNA crossovers N. Where, sspacer comprised 2.5 × 106 bp of the genetic material. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8  

5.2.3 Engineering Synthetic
Supersecondary Structures
Parental supersecondary structures
were identified by partitioning
the bovine brain 14-3-3 gene into a DNA tertiary code followed by
analysis utilizing STRIDE51 knowledge-based
secondary structure algorithms. Evolution was performed by ligation
of genomic building blocks randomly selected from genomic alphabet
libraries encompassing 5′ and 3′ terminals of parental
structures. A cleaving algorithm was utilized to remove 5′
and 3′ prime overhangs from synthetic supersecondary structures.
Natural selection was performed by limiting selection to naturally
occurring mutations utilizing Blosum80 mutation frequency algorithms.
SYN-AI also accomplished natural selection by imposing a secondary
structure homology threshold >90 percent identity, wherein synthetic
sequences were aligned with parental 14-3-3 secondary sequences. A
standalone version of PSIPRED 4.052 was
utilized to evaluate secondary structure. Synthetic supersecondary
structures were stored in DTER libraries for writing DNA code.

5.2.4 Writing DNA Code from Scratch
DNA
code was written from scratch by walking the DTER followed by random
selection and ligation of synthetic supersecondary structures stored
in genomic alphabet libraries. SYN-AI constructed a library of 1 ×
107 genes that was passed through a set of neural networks
that evaluated the closeness of synthetic protein structural states
to native states. Wherein, SYN-AI set a minimal closeness threshold
of >90 percent identity according to.71 A subsequent selection limited supersecondary structures to those
characterized by naturally occurring mutations. The aforementioned
was performed utilizing BLOSUM8053,54 mutation frequency
algorithms. A further round of natural selection restricted selection
to synthetic 14-3-3 docking proteins characterized by mean secondary
structure identities within the top quantile. Structurally conserved
and functional 14-3-3 docking proteins were selected by a final natural
selection protocol that evaluated the closeness of protein active
sites and hydrophobic interfaces to the parental bovine 14-3-3 docking
protein. Wherein, selection was limited to synthetic proteins characterized
by closeness thresholds of >90 percent identity.

5.2.5 Analysis of Synthetic Proteins
Sequence homology of
synthetic proteins to parental bovine 14-3-3
docking protein was analyzed utilizing the Clustal Omega multiple
sequence alignment tool.12 Wherein, phylogenetic
analysis was performed utilizing Phylogeny.fr. Furthermore, we analyzed
synthetic protein three-dimensional structure utilizing the I-TASSER
suite.55 Wherein, protein–protein
interaction and ligand-binding sites were analyzed utilizing Cofactor
and Coach.56

5.2.6 Building
SYN-AI-1 Biological Complex
SYN-AI-1 was overlapped with
the native 14-3-3 ζ monomer utilizing
the Superpose server. Upon the conformation of nearly identical overlap,
the SYN-AI-1 N-acetyl transferase octameric complex
was built utilizing UCSF Chimera76 with
Biological Complex 2 reported in ref (75) as the template. Rotamers were mutated to those
characterizing SYN-AI-1 and C′-terminal residues 215–228
deleted from chains A–D. Energy minimization of each chain
within the complex was performed utilizing AMBER78 with 100 steepest decent steps with a step size of 0.02
Å and 10 conjugant gradient steps at a step size of 0.02 Å.
The process was repeated until a good structure was obtained. Energy
minimization was performed utilizing the steric method. Charges were
added to standard residues utilizing the Gasteiger method and computed
utilizing ANTECHAMBER.77 Upon obtaining
a good structure, energy minimization was performed upon the entire
biological complex utilizing the hydrogen bond method with 400 steepest
decent steps and 20 conjugant gradient steps. Ions were removed from
the structure, and the structure solvated utilizing AMBER with a shell
of 12.0 Å applying the hydrogen bond and TIP3PBOX method. Hydrogen
bond interactions with residues 28–33 of the serotonin N-acetyl transferase [RRHTLP] motif were analyzed with relaxed
constraints of 4.0 Å and 20 degrees. Clashes and contacts were
identified with Van der Waals overlap distances of greater or equal
to 6.0 Å, with a correction of −5.0 Å for potential
hydrogen bonding pairs. Overlaps and clashes within four bonding pairs
were excluded.
