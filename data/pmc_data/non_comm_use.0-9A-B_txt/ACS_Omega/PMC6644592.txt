We
carry out detailed investigation for topological effects of
two molecular systems, NO3 radical and C6H6+ (Bz+) radical cation, where the dressed
adiabatic, dressed diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potential
energy curves (PECs) are generated employing ab initio calculated
adiabatic and diabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs). We have implemented
beyond Born–Oppenheimer (BBO) theory for constructing smooth,
single-valued, and continuous diabatic PESs for five coupled electronic
states [J. Phys. Chem. A2017,121, 6314–6326]. In the case of NO3 radical,
the nonadiabatic coupling terms (NACTs) among the low-lying five electronic
states, namely, X̃2A2′ (12B2), A~2E″
(12A2 and 12B1), and B~2E′ (12A1 and 22B2), bear the signature of Jahn–Teller
(JT) interactions, pseudo JT (PJT) interactions, and accidental conical
intersections (CIs). Similarly, Bz+ radical cation also
exhibits JT, PJT, and accidental CIs in the interested domain of nuclear
configuration space. In order to generate dressed PECs, two components
of degenerate in-plane asymmetric stretching modes are selectively
chosen for both the molecular species (Q3x–Q3y pair for NO3 radical and Q16x–Q16y pair for Bz+ radical cation). The JT
coupling between the electronic states is essentially originated through
the asymmetric stretching normal mode pair, where the coupling elements
exhibit symmetric and nonlinear functional behavior along Q3x and Q16x normal modes.

1 Introduction
The Born–Oppenheimer
(BO) approximation1,2 completely
decouples the mechanics of fast-moving electrons and slow-moving nuclei,
leading to satisfactory explanation of several experimental findings.
On the contrary, complete or partial failure of this theoretical framework
could be encountered for excited-state molecular processes such as
charge-transfer reactions, measurements of scattering cross sections,
and photochemical reactions.3,4 In such phenomena, the
non-negligible electron–nuclear coupling designated as nonadiabatic
coupling terms (NACTs) not only plays a significant role for this
discrepancy but also attains singular characteristics at degenerate
points in the nuclear configuration space (CS). Therefore, overlooking
of NACTs,5,6 one of the major outcomes of BO treatment
often leads to erroneous dynamical results and inaccurate numerical
data regarding the molecular processes.

In the early sixties,
Longuet-Higgins noticed multivaluedness of
the eigenfunctions7 while traversing along
a closed path encircling a point of conical intersection (CI). Though
this unusual behavior was circumvented by incorporating a phase factor8 in an ad hoc manner, Mead and Truhlar9 eliminated this multivaluedness behavior of wavefunctions
by encompassing a vector potential into the nuclear Hamiltonian. On
the other hand, the Hellmann–Feynman theorem predicts the possibility
of singularity in NACTs10,11 over the nuclear CS
whenever electronic states appear to be degenerate or near degenerate.
This singular characteristics can be removed by transforming to a
different representation or basis, known as the diabatic representation
where the singular kinetic coupling terms are converted into smoothly
varying off-diagonal terms in the diabatic potential energy matrix.
Such unitary transformation is known as the adiabatic-to-diabatic
transformation (ADT). In this context, it may be noted that vector
field created by the NACTs can be decomposed into longitudinal and
transverse components, where the former is expressed as the derivative
of a scalar and the latter by the curl of a vector. By performing
ADT, the longitudinal component (the removable part) can be eliminated,5,12 whereas the transverse or the nonremovable part may be neglected
at the close vicinity of a CI.

Hobey and Mclachlan devised the
first technique of ADT only for
one degree of freedom and latter on, F. T. Smith implemented this
method for a diatomic molecule. M. Baer proposed a general formalism
for the diabatization of two coupled adiabatic potential energy surfaces
(PESs) involved on the process of triatomic collision. In that work,
the ADT condition is depicted which is the key mechanistic element
for the determination of the ADT matrix elements by integrating the
differential equations along a two-dimensional contour over the nuclear
CS.5,12 On the other hand, only the fulfillment
of “curl condition”12,13 guarantees
the existence and the uniqueness of the solution to those equations.
Generally, ADT angles can be calculated by integrating the NACTs around
the CI point(s) and because of the quantized nature of the closed
contour integrals, resulting angles will attain magnitudes in multiples
of π (pi).14 The satisfaction of
aforementioned curl conditions also validates the presence of a set
of electronic states forming a complete space. Though the above said
condition is invalid at the degenerate CI point(s), nevertheless,
the singular NACTs can be taken out from the SE if the line integrals
exhibit quantization within the sub-Hilbert space constituted with
all coupled electronic states.15 The beyond
BO (BBO) treatment for three, four, and five coupled electronic states
in terms of electronic basis functions or the ADT matrix elements
has been generalized by Adhikari et al.,16−19 and the explicit expressions
of the NACTs, curl–divergence equations, curl conditions, and
the diabatic PESs have also been formulated in terms of the ADT angles.
Moreover, this theoretical development has been successfully employed
on model16−18,20 as well as realistic19,21−24 systems for constructing smooth, continuous, and single-valued diabatic
PESs. Molecular systems having strong vibronic interactions between
five electronic states are omnipresent in nature. NO3 radical
and C6H6+ (Bz+) radical
cation are two highly intricate examples of five electronic state
sub-Hilbert spaces. Recently, we have pursued formulation of BBO equations
for five state sub-Hilbert spaces, devised the ADT equations and explicit
expressions of NACTs in terms of ADT angles, and successfully implemented
the formalism for NO3 radical and Bz+ radical
cation.

In this article, our aim is to generate dressed adiabatic
potential
energy curves (PECs), dressed diabatic PECs, and adiabatic PECs via
dressed diabatic potentials in a pair of normal mode coordinates for
both the molecular/ionic species. The PECs carry the signature of
topological effects in their functional variation along a particular
normal mode coordinate by taking average over the other normal mode
coordinate. Symmetric variation of dressed diabatic couplings indicates
the absence of linear and higher odd order functions in electron–nuclear
couplings, whereas asymmetric diabatic couplings incorporate both
odd and even order polynomials in their functional forms. Detailed
topological studies clearly reveal effects of NACTs in stabilization
or destabilization of PESs.

NO3 radical is one of
the most challenging molecular
species in the realm of nonadiabatic dynamics. It exhibits highly
complex spectral features due to intense vibronic coupling between
its low-lying five electronic states X̃2A2′ (12B2), A~2E″ (12A2 and 12B1), and B~2E′ (12A1 and 22B2) in the Franck–Condon
region of nuclear CS. Several theoretical predictions were already
proposed to elucidate the underlying principle of the complex spectral
envelop, obtained from various experimental tools such as dispersed
fluorescence spectroscopy,25,26 Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy,27,28 photoelectron spectroscopy,29 and also from cavity ringdown spectroscopy.30,31 In spite of various controversies about the ground state equilibrium
geometry, Eisfeld and Morokuma32 finally
confirmed the radical to be of D3h symmetry. Mayer et al.,33 Faraji
et al.,34 and Stanton et al.35,36 also proposed some theoretical development to reveal the key features
of the experimentally obtained spectral profile. It is noteworthy
to mention that strong Jahn–Teller (JT) interactions prevail
within the A~2E″ and B~2E′ states at the equilibrium D3h point along with several
accidental CIs at C2v geometries.19,37 In addition, the ground state, X̃2A2′ experiences strong pseudo JT (PJT)
interaction due to the B~2E′
state.19,37 These vibronic phenomena strongly influence
the nuclear dynamics and the associated features of the photoelectron
spectra29,38 of the NO3– anion.

The photophysics of Bz+ radical cation is one of the
center of attraction in the arena of BBO theory. In all theoretical
developments,39−47 the electronic states, namely, X̃2E1g, B~2E2g, C̃2A2u, D̃2E1u, and E~2B2u, along with the CIs among the PESs were investigated
for its dynamical studies. Goode et al.48 pointed out the complex vibrational pattern of B~2E2g state using the combined effect of Herzberg–Teller
and PJT coupling between this state and close-lying C̃2A2u state. JT coupling parameters for e2g vibrational modes of this radical cation which are used
to illustrate the photoinduced Rydberg ionization spectra of the B~2E2g state49 were extensively measured by Johnson.50 The low-lying doublet states of Bz+, B~2E2g, and C̃2A2u show intense nonadiabatic interactions39 among them. The JT effects within the ground, X̃2E1g as well as the excited
state, B~2E2g are quite
predominant particularly lowering the symmetry of ground state equilibrium
structure of Bz+ to D2h.42,50 Apart from the JT effects, there are accidental
CIs and PJT interactions prevailing between B~2E2g and C̃2A2u states.39 We have investigated
the JT interactions of the ground (X̃2E1g) and excited states (B~2E2g) as well as accidental CIs within the higher
excited states (B~2E2g–C̃2A2u) using
the ADT equations by employing the BBO formalism.19

The article is arranged as follows: Section 2 presents detailed theoretical
framework
of BBO theory for a five electronic state sub-Hilbert spaces. This
section also gives a brief description of the underlying equations
for calculating dressed potentials. In Section 3, we explore topological effects prevailing
in both of the molecular systems. This detailed investigation will
be highly useful to predict the possible functional forms of the inherent
nonadiabatic couplings. Finally, the summary of this topological study
is laid out in Section 4.

2 BBO Theory and Diabatic Hamiltonian
As per
the BO treatment, total molecular wavefunction can be expanded
as a linear combination of the electronic wavefunctions where the
combining coefficients represent the nuclear counterpart. While considering
a sub-Hilbert space of finite dimension, a total electron–nuclei
wavefunction takes the following form 1  

This wavefunction is the eigenfunction
of molecular SE, and the
corresponding eigenvalue represents the total energy of the system 2  

The molecular Hamiltonian
can be partitioned into a nuclear kinetic
energy operator (T̂n) and the electronic
Hamiltonian (Ĥe(se|sn)) 3  where the nuclear kinetic energy operator
is defined as 4  

On the other hand,
electronic wavefunctions (|ξi(se|sn)⟩),
that is, the basis of the BO expansion, are
eigenfunctions of Ĥe(se|sn) operator with a nuclear
coordinate-dependent eigenvalue ui(sn). Therefore, the electronic
eigenvalue equation is presented as below 5  

When the BO expansion of molecular
wavefunction is substituted
in total Hamiltonian [eq 2] and it is projected with various electronic wavefunctions, the
compact adiabatic (kinetically coupled) SE takes the following matrix
form 6  where Uij = uiδij and τ⃗ is the nonadiabatic
coupling matrix (NACM) defined as 7  

The adiabatic representation
of the SE is difficult to solve because
of the numerical instability of the NACTs at the points of degeneracy.
Therefore, we encounter the limitations of the adiabatic representations
which exhibit the inevitable necessity of a different representation
where the nonadiabatic interactions appear as continuous, smooth,
and single-valued diabatic coupling terms. This transformation could
be achieved by using an orthogonal rotation matrix (A) 8  where ψ and
ϕd symbolize
the adiabatic and diabatic nuclear wavefunction, respectively.

While incorporating the aforementioned form of wavefunction, diabatic
representation of the nuclear SE takes the following expression 9  where 10  under the condition 11  known as the ADT condition.

The ADT condition [eq 11] can be used as the precursor
of devising the ADT equations.
For five (5) electronic state sub-Hilbert spaces, the model ADT matrix
can be constructed by multiplying 5C2 rotation
matrices in a particular way. Those could be arranged in 5C2! different ways, but we carry out the formulation for
a particular order of multiplication. On the other hand, anyone of
the possible arrangements produces same numerical value of the diabatic
potential energy matrices. For any one of the rotation matrices, Aij(θij), where ii and jj elements
become cosθij and ij and ji elements take the form of sinθij and −sinθij, respectively. Among the remaining elements, diagonal terms
are one, whereas the off-diagonal terms acquire the magnitude of zero.

For five state sub-Hilbert space, the order of multiplication is
taken as 12  

When this model rotation matrix and
NACM are incorporated in eq 11, a set of differential
equations (ADT equations) can be formulated by solving the matrix
form of ADT condition. Because of the absence of any analytic solution
of these differential equations, they must be integrated numerically
to obtain the ADT angles which are used to construct the ADT matrix
at each and every grid points in the interested domain of the nuclear
CS. During the transformation of adiabatic PESs to the diabatic one,
a similarity transformation [eq 10] is carried out such that the NACTs take the form
of diabatic coupling elements which appear in diagonal and off-diagonal
elements of the diabatic potential energy matrix.

ADT equation for “1–2” coupling of five coupled
electronic states can be formulated as19 13  

If the adiabatic PESs are used for the simulation of the photoelectron
spectrum of any molecule, the nonadiabatic interactions are overlooked
and the inconsistency between the theoretically predicted and experimentally
probed spectrum is maximum at the points of JT as well as accidental
CIs. Diabatization not only removes the singularity of the NACTs but
also can be used for carrying out nuclear dynamics to reproduce the
photodetachment spectra21 and to study
the reactive scattering dynamics51 to obtain
integral cross sections.

3 Dressed Adiabatic, Dressed
Diabatic, and Adiabatic-via-Dressed
Diabatic PECs: Topological Effects
In a polyatomic molecule,
nonadiabatic couplings could exhibit
multidimensional functional behavior over the nuclear CS due to the
interactions of multiple electronic states through several vibrational
degrees of freedom. In order to understand the contribution of each
vibrational mode on the overall nonadiabatic interactions in a molecule,
detailed investigation of topological effects is the most suitable
approach. Moreover, it is readily realizable that functional features
of PESs and NACTs defined over a multidimensional vector space cannot
be displayed in the Euclidean space because of restriction in the
number of independent axes.

In our present ab initio calculation,
PESs and NACTs are evaluated
as functions of two normal modes (Qi and Qj), keeping
the other ones at their equilibrium. As a consequence, while constructing
dressed potential curves (adiabatic as well as diabatic) and dressed
diabatic couplings along a specific coordinate, the average effect
of other mode can be embedded by integrating adiabatic and diabatic
potential matrix elements over the second one. In this topological
investigation, we have employed ab initio-based calculation to evaluate
adiabatic PESs and NACTs and use first-principles-based transformation
equations to construct diabatic PESs as a function of different pairs
of normal modes, where the other modes are at equilibrium for each
case. Such adiabatic and diabatic PESs are averaged over ground vibrational
eigenfunctions of respective electronic states for a specific mode,
and PECs are obtained to realize the topological effect originating
from the other mode. The dimensionless mass-weighted normal mode coordinates
can be defined as 14  where ωi and mk signify the
vibrational frequency of ith vibrational mode and
atomic masses, respectively. On the other hand, xki and xk0 represent Cartesian coordinates at distorted and equilibrium nuclear
geometry.

The dressed adiabatic potentials () for ith mode and pth electronic
state can be defined as 15  where up(Qj|Qi)s represent five adiabatic PESs and
ζp,v=0a(Qj|Qi) signifies
ground vibrational eigenfunction (v = 0) of the corresponding
adiabatic PESs (p). Here,  are the dressed adiabatic PESs
along Qi where the other
effects of
other normal mode (Qj) are averaged out.

Similarly, dressed diabatic potentials
() for ith normal
mode and
m,n electronic state can be expressed as 16  

When this dressed diabatic energy matrix is diagonalized,
adiabatic-via-dressed
diabatic potential () is obtained.

Dressed adiabatic, diabatic
PECs, and dressed diabatic couplings
depict 1D functional form of potentials as well as couplings, where
the effect of another mode is averaged out with respect to ground
vibrational wavefunctions of different electronic states. It is needless
to say that dressed PECs and diabatic couplings have nothing to do
while studying photoelectron spectrum or performing reactive scattering
calculation, but those functions can predict a lot of interesting
facts about the structural features of the molecule and analytic expressions
of diabatic couplings as a function of a specific coordinate. Indeed,
such curves are highly useful to speculate nonadiabatic effects arising
from a specific mode on the photoelectron spectrum or reactive cross
sections of a molecular process. It is noteworthy to mention that
not only the normal mode coordinates but also their associated polar
counterparts (ρ and ϕ) may be employed to construct dressed
PECs. We can definitely perform topological study along these polar
coordinates to explore their contribution on nonadiabatic interactions,
but the origination of JT couplings (either sole contribution of even
order polynomials, or incorporation of both linear and higher order
interactions) cannot be illustrated because of the absence of any
symmetric/asymmetric variations of PECs along the ρ coordinate.
Dressed adiabatic PECs cannot incorporate any effects of nonadiabatic
coupling, whereas dressed diabatic potentials and diabatic coupling
elements encompass diagonal and off-diagonal electron–nuclear
couplings, respectively. While diagonalizing dressed diabatic matrix,
effects of off-diagonal couplings are plugged into the newly generated
adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potentials which include both diagonal
and off-diagonal nonadiabatic interactions.

4 Results
and Discussion
4.1 NO3 Radical
In the realm
of nonadiabatic chemistry, NO3 radical appears to be an
excellent representative system for five coupled electronic states.
Several research groups have carried out thorough investigations to
dig out exact equilibrium structure and complex features of photoelectron
spectra. In order to achieve more structural insight, dressed potentials
can be constructed by averaging out one of the normal mode coordinates.
Low-lying five electronic states, namely, X̃2A2′ (12B2), A~2E″(12A2 and 12B1), and B~2E′ (12A1 and 22B2), are mainly responsible
for the inherent nonadiabatic interactions. Therefore, we employ polar
analogue (ρ and ϕ) of two degenerate components of in-plane
asymmetric stretching vibrational mode (ν3) (symbolized
as Q3x–Q3y plane) to perform the ab
initio calculations. This radical has been optimized employing UCCSD(T)
(a spin unrestricted coupled cluster method with all single and double
excitations and perturbative accounts of triple excitations) level
of calculation, and the optimized parameters are presented in Table 1.37 Adiabatic PESs for five lowest electronic states19 have been already constructed using state-averaged
complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) calculations
employing 6-31g** basis set and (9e, 8o) configuration active space
(CAS). On the other hand, analytic NACTs19 between the five low-lying electronic states have been obtained
by implementing coupled-perturbed multi configuration space self-consistent
field (CP-MCSCF) theory. In this nuclear plane, strong JT interactions
are present within E″ as well as E′ states, forming
“2–3” and “4–5” JT CIs at
the equilibrium D3h point.
Three additional accidental CIs can be observed within two sheets
of E′ state at three equivalent C2v points (ρ ≈ 3.0 and ϕ = 30°,
150°, and 270°). Moreover, nonzero functional forms of τ14 and τ15 validate strong PJT interactions
between ground state (A2′) and the two sheets of E′ state
labeled as “1–4” and “1–5”
couplings.

In order to exploit the inherent symmetry
of the molecule (D3h),
ADT equations are solved
for the chosen pair of normal modes (Q3x–Q3y) along the ρ coordinate for each ϕ grid.19 Our aim is to construct dressed adiabatic, dressed
diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potentials along Q3x and Q3y normal mode coordinates. Dressed adiabatic
and dressed diabatic PECs are plotted as functions of Qi by taking average over the other normal
mode coordinate (Qj),
whereas adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potentials can be generated
by diagonalizing the dressed diabatic energy matrix (WQj(Qi)). Figure 1 depicts symmetric variation of dressed adiabatic,
dressed diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potential energies
along Q3x mode. On the
other hand, PECs plotted in Figure 2 exhibit asymmetric variation while scanning along
the Q3y mode. Such a
different functional behavior originates if the component of the asymmetric
stretching vibration does or does not produce equivalent geometry
during positive and negative distortions. It can be observed that
three PECs are widely separated in Figure 1a due to strong PJT couplings within ground
A2′ and
E′ states. On the contrary, they almost coincide in Figure 1b and 1c because of weak JT interaction within E″ state. Finally, Figure 1d and 1e depict variation of third and fourth excited electronic
states originated from JT and PJT interactions within the given range
of Q3x normal mode coordinates.
Again, Figure 2 represents
asymmetric functional features of PECs along Q3y normal modes. It is noteworthy to mention
that the Q3y normal mode
generates nonequivalent geometries at both sides of the equilibrium
structure (Q3y = 0).
Moreover, dressed diabatic coupling elements are not only smooth,
continuous, and single-valued but also exhibit similar functional
characteristics of the diabatic potential. Figure 3 illustrates symmetric variation of dressed
diabatic coupling terms [, , , and ] along Q3x coordinate where the functional
forms of the dressed
diabatic coupling elements are constituted only with even power polynomials
of Q3x. Now, it is needless
to say that JT interactions prevailing within E″ as well as
E′ states do not originate from any linear coupling. Higher
order electron-nuclear coupling plays the major role behind these
JT interactions. On the other hand, Figure 4 represents different behaviors of electron-nuclear
couplings along positive and negative directions of the Q3y normal mode. They loose their symmetric
nature, and the corresponding functional form of coupling incorporates
odd power terms.

Figure 1 Dressed adiabatic (), diabatic (), and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic () PECs (n = 1–5)
are depicted for (a) ground, (b) first excited, (c) second excited,
(d) third excited, and (e) fourth excited states of NO3 radical along Q3x normal
mode taking average over Q3y. All of the PECs exhibit symmetric variation and nonlinear
functional characteristics.

Figure 2 Dressed adiabatic (), diabatic (), and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic () PECs (n = 1–5)
are represented for (a) ground, (b) first excited, (c) second excited,
(d) third excited, and (e) fourth excited electronic states of NO3 along Q3y normal
mode taking average over Q3x. Here, the PECs are asymmetric and incorporate linear functionalities.

Figure 3 Dressed diabatic coupling terms of NO3 radical along Q3x normal
mode: (a)  and (b)  are smooth,
symmetric as well as continuous
appeared due to “2–3” and “4–5”
JT CIs and three “4–5” accidental CIs. On the
other hand, symmetric and single-valued (c)  and (d)  represent PJT
couplings. Therefore, JT
activity is originated solely because of nonlinear couplings along
the Q3x mode.

Figure 4 Dressed diabatic coupling terms of NO3 radical
along
the Q3y normal mode.
Here, (a) , (b) , (c) , and (d)  all are smooth
and continuous but the variation
is asymmetric. Along Q3y normal mode, JT coupling contains linear as well as nonlinear functionalities.

4.2 Bz+ Radical Cation
Detailed
ab initio study has been already carried out to explore the nonadiabatic
interactions prevailing within five low-lying electronic states of
the Bz+ radical cation. Further investigations are necessary
to illustrate the origin and functional forms of dressed potentials
as well as dressed diabatic coupling elements. In order to reveal
those functional features, we have constructed three types of dressed
PECs (adiabatic, diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic) and
dressed diabatic coupling terms along two components of the degenerate
in-plane asymmetric stretching mode (ν16) (Q16x and Q16y). This pairwise normal mode is selectively
chosen because of its immense importance while depicting major inherent
nonadiabaticities present in this radical cation. Before discussing
our theoretical findings, a brief summary of the ab initio details19 should be clearly mentioned for proper understanding
of the newly constructed dressed PECs. Those first-principles-based
quantum calculations for neutral species reveal the D6h symmetric structure at the equilibrium
geometry, whereas the cationic species attends D2h point group due to intense JT distortion.
In the case of Bz+ radical cation, geometry optimization
has been carried out implementing B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee–Yang–Parr)
calculation and the optimized parameters are supplied in Table 2. Ab initio adiabatic
PESs have been constructed in CASSCF methodology for the lowest five
doublet states of Bz+, viz, X~2E1g (12B3g and 12B2g), B~2E2g (12Ag and 12B1g), and C~2A2u (12B1u) employing Gaussian basis set
6-31g** with an active space of 29 electrons distributed over 15 orbitals
(29e, 15o). Moreover, analytic NACTs are obtained from CP-MCSCF methodology
implemented in MOLPRO52 quantum chemistry
software. Because Q16x and Q16y produce strong
JT interactions within E1g and E2g states at
the D6h point (ρ
= 0.0), lower sheets get more stabilized and the corresponding NACTs
(τ12 and τ34) tend to blow up (at
ρ = 0.0), validating the presence of JT CIs.

In order to carry out diabatization of PESs, dimensionless mass-weighted
normal mode coordinates are first converted into their polar counterparts
(ρ and ϕ) to scan the entire adiabatic PESs and the NACTs.
Our ultimate objective is to construct dressed adiabatic, dressed
diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic potentials along Q16x and Q16y normal mode coordinates. Figure 5 displays symmetric functional
forms of dressed PECs for four lowest electronic states along the Q16x normal mode, whereas the
PECs exhibit asymmetric behavior along the Q16y mode (Figure 6). Likewise NO3 radical, such
type of interesting characteristic features are originated because
of the formation of equivalent and nonequivalent geometries along Q16x and Q16y coordinates, respectively. For the Bz+ radical cation, three types of PECs (dressed adiabatic, dressed
diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic) along Q16x are largely separated from each other
(Figure 5a–d)
because of strong JT couplings. On the other hand, those PECs are
exactly superimposed for fifth electronic state because of their noninvolvement
in any nonadiabatic interactions along the Q16x–Q16y pairwise mode. It is evident from Figure 5 that adiabatic-via-dressed
diabatic curves obtained from diagonalization of dressed diabatic
potential matrix exhibit one shallow minimum for ground and second
excited electronic states (Figure 5a and 5c) and two shallow troughs
for first and third excited ones (Figure 5b and 5d). On the
other hand, asymmetric functional features of dressed PECs are exhibited
along the Q16y mode (Figure 6) which signify the
incorporation of both odd and even power polynomials in the analytic
formulation. Functional forms of dressed diabatic coupling elements
also display similar trends along the two normal modes. Symmetric
variation of the dressed diabatic coupling terms are represented in Figure 7a and 7b, validating the contribution of only even power polynomials
for electron–nuclear couplings in the strong symmetry breaking
JT interactions. On the other hand, asymmetric dressed diabatic couplings
are depicted along Q16y coordinate in Figure 8a and 8b, where the nonadiabatic interactions
incorporate both odd and even power polynomials for couplings. Therefore,
it can be concluded that JT interaction along this component (Q16y) shows both linear and
nonlinear dependence.

Figure 5 Dressed adiabatic (), diabatic (), and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic () PECs (n = 1–4)
are plotted for low-lying four electronic states of Bz+ radical cation in diagrams (a–d), respectively, along Q16x normal mode taking average
over the other component, Q16y. All PECs undergo symmetric variation and include only the
even order functional forms.

Figure 6 Dressed adiabatic (), diabatic (), and adiabatic-via-dressed diabatic () PECs (n = 1–4)
are portrayed for lowest four electronic states of Bz+ radical
cation in diagrams (a–d), respectively, along the Q16y normal mode by averaging over Q16x. Here, PECs are asymmetric
and incorporate both linear and nonlinear terms.

Figure 7 Dressed diabatic coupling terms are plotted along Q16x normal mode of the Bz+ radical cation. Figures (a,b) depict  and , respectively.
Both are symmetric, indicating
nonlinear “1–2” and “3–4”
JT interactions.

Figure 8 Dressed diabatic coupling
terms are plotted with the variation
of Q16y normal mode coordinates
of the Bz+ radical cation. Figures (a,b) describe  and , respectively.
Along Q16y normal mode,
JT coupling contains

5 Conclusions
For the last few decades,
several investigations have been carried
out for highly complex scenario in the field of nonadiabatic dynamics
of NO3 radical and Bz+ radical cation. In this
perspective, an accurate investigation is necessary to explore the
topological effects among the pairwise normal mode coordinates. Till
now, nonadiabatic couplings have been extensively studied for two
to five electronic state sub-Hilbert spaces19,21−24 to generate highly accurate diabatic PESs. On the contrary, topological
studies have been carried out only for two and three coupled electronic
states22−24 which is relevant for predicting the functional forms
of dressed diabatic couplings. It is needless to say that in most
cases, linear functions of normal mode coordinates are only responsible
for JT stabilization, but we have already explored the sole contribution
of even power couplings24 for JT and RT
CIs in the case of NO2 molecule. It has been clearly revealed
that selection rule for the electronic transition in NO2 molecule originates mainly because of even power coupling elements.
In this article, dressed adiabatic, dressed diabatic, and adiabatic-via-dressed
diabatic electronic states are constructed for two real molecular
systems of five electronic state sub-Hilbert space where one can explore
the importance of even power coupling modes in JT interaction apart
from the traditional ones involving both odd and even power interactions.

In Sections 2 and 3, the basic theoretical developments of BBO methodology
as well as detailed background on the formulation of dressed PECs
are presented explicitly and in the following section, importance
of those PECs for NO3 radical and Bz+ radical
cation is investigated. From the previous theoretical investigations,19,37 it has been observed that NO3 possesses several kinds
of nonadiabatic interactions, namely, JT CI, accidental CI and PJT
coupling, whereas the Bz+ radical cation is deliberately
chosen for its strong JT interaction. NO3 exhibits JT interaction
within E″ as well as E′ states, accidental CIs between
two sheets of E′ states along with substantial amount of PJT
couplings between “1–4” and “1–5”
states. Several groups have performed detailed study on the vibronic
couplings to unfold its structural details and complex spectral features,
but in this work, topological study for five coupled electronic states
is carried out for the first time. Calculated dressed diabatic coupling
terms exhibit symmetric and asymmetric functional behaviors along Q3x and Q3y modes, respectively though both of the
normal modes are responsible for JT coupling. Similar trend is also
observed for Q16x and Q16y modes of Bz+ radical cation. These modes are mainly responsible for JT CIs within
E1g and E2g electronic states. Q16x component produces symmetric variation
of PECs as well as dressed diabatic couplings, which clearly indicates
the signature of higher order JT interactions originated from even
power functions of Q16x coordinate. On the contrary, Q16y shows profound asymmetry in dressed PECs and dressed diabatic
couplings. For the latter one, analytic forms of JT couplings contain
both linear and nonlinear polynomials. Finally, we conclude that since
this study validates our previous findings not only for lower but
also for higher dimensional sub-Hilbert space, the effect of nonadiabaticity
on molecular processes is a topological one.
