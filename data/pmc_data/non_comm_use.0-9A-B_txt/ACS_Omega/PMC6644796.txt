Bi2O3 Nanocluster-Modified TiO2 and
the Role of Reduction in Promoting CO2 Activation Nolan Michael *Tyndall National Institute, UCC, Lee Maltings, Dyke Parade, Cork T12 R5CP, Ireland* E-mail: michael.nolan@tyndall.ie.12 10 2018 31 10 2018 3 10 13117 13128 09 08 2018 16 08 2018 Copyright © 2018 American Chemical Society2018American Chemical SocietyThis is an open access article published under a Creative Commons Attribution (CC-BY) License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the author and source are cited.

The capture and conversion
of CO2 are of significant
importance in enabling the production of sustainable fuels, contributing
to alleviating greenhouse gas emissions. While there are a number
of key steps required to convert CO2, the initial step
of adsorption and activation by the catalyst is critical. Well-known
metal oxides such as oxidized TiO2 or CeO2 are
unable to promote this step. In addressing this difficult problem,
a recent experimental work shows the potential for bismuth-containing
materials to adsorb and convert CO2, the origin of which
is attributed to the role of the bismuth lone pair. In this paper,
we present density functional theory (DFT) simulations of enhanced
CO2 adsorption on heterostructures composed of extended
TiO2 rutile (110) and anatase (101) surfaces modified with
Bi2O3 nanoclusters, highlighting in particular
the role of heterostructure reduction in activating CO2. These heterostructures show low coordinated Bi sites in the nanoclusters
and a valence band edge that is dominated by Bi–O states, typical
of the Bi3+ lone pair. The reduction of Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures can be facile and
produces reduced Bi2+ and Ti3+ species. The
interaction of CO2 with this electron-rich, reduced system
can produce CO directly, reoxidizing the heterostructure, or form
an activated carboxyl species (CO2–)
through electron transfer from the reduced heterostructure to CO2. The oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures can adsorb CO2 in carbonate-like
adsorption modes, with moderately strong adsorption energies. The
hydrogenation of the nanocluster and migration to adsorbed CO2 is feasible with H-migration barriers less than 0.7 eV, but
this forms a stable COOH intermediate rather than breaking C–O
bonds or producing formate. These results highlight that a reducible
metal oxide heterostructure composed of a semiconducting metal oxide
modified with suitable metal oxide nanoclusters can activate CO2, potentially overcoming the difficulties associated with
the difficult first step in CO2 conversion.

1 Introduction
Increasing energy demand
is leading to fossil fuel supply issues,
and the use of fossil fuels has pushed the atmospheric CO2 concentration to 410 ppm. Continuing CO2 emissions are
projected to result in a higher than 2 °C rise in average global
temperatures. Given these severe societal problems, there is an urgent
need to find materials that can convert the CO2 produced
by the combustion of fossil fuels back to the fuels or to the precursors
for the production of more useful chemicals. This will reduce our
reliance on nonsustainable fossil fuels and contribute to curbing
anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The solar-driven photoreduction
or thermal reduction of CO2 to CO or directly to liquid
fuels will enable a sustainable approach to producing fuels and storing
solar energy in high-energy chemical bonds.1−11

Using solar energy, for example, through solar concentrators,
coupled
with catalysts that can promote activation of CO2 to drive
the CO2 reduction process, is an attractive strategy to
meet this ambitious aim. However, to date, there are no practical
catalysts that can exploit solar energy to efficiently reduce CO2 to useful chemical species. A range of different catalysts
for CO2 conversion using electrocatalysis, thermochemical
catalysis, and photocatalysis has been investigated in recent years,
and an example of such a photocatalyst is Pt-modified TiO2 nanotubes.8,12,13 However, the efficiencies for methane production are extremely low,
and Pt will never be an economically viable catalyst for large-scale
CO2 conversion.

Irrespective of how electrons are
provided to reduce CO2, the key step in any CO2 capture and use/conversion process
is the initial adsorption of CO2, which should promote
the “activation” of the molecule. This activation can
be a charge transfer to CO2, distortions to the molecular
structure such as bending of O–C–O away from the linear
elongations in the molecular C–O distances, or hydrogenation.
CO2 should either dissociate to a CO molecule or undergo
hydrogenation to produce methane or methanol, via formate or carboxyl
pathways. The activation should also avoid the production of overstabilized
inactive surface-bound carbonates which would poison the catalyst.

In recent years, catalysts based on metallic Cu, oxide-derived
Cu, or Cu with mixed oxidation states have gained great interest and
have been demonstrated to reduce CO2 to useful molecules
such as methane, methanol, or ethanol.14−22 Recent experimental work indicates the ability of nanocatalysts
containing a mix of Cu+ and Cu2+ oxidation states
and in oxide-like structures to promote CO2 reduction1,2,10,14−16,18,19,21−29 and this includes Cu metal, oxide-derived Cu, and mixed oxidation
state Cu. Modeling the interaction of CO2 with copper oxides using
density functional theory (DFT) has provided useful results for further
development of catalysts for CO2 conversion. Wu et al.
studied the adsorption of CO2 at the Cu2O(111)
surface in which excess electrons were produced through the formation
of oxygen vacancies18 and found that dissociative
adsorption of CO2 was thermodynamically unfeasible, and
although a CO2δ− anion could be
formed, this was not favorable, and hence excess electrons are not
necessarily sufficient to promote CO2 capture and conversion.
Wu et al. also studied the adsorption of CO2 and its derivatives
at Cu2O(111) using hybrid DFT21 and found that only the adsorption of linear CO2 was
favorable. This is supported by the work of Benavid and Carter who
showed that physisorption of linear CO2 is favored over
adsorption of bent anionic CO2.19 Mishra and colleagues reported strong CO2 chemisorption
at the high-energy Cu–O-terminated (110) surface of Cu2O15 and exothermic adsorption of
CO2 at the high-energy (011) surface of CuO.2 Uzunova et al. studied the conversion of CO2 to methanol on Cu2O nanolayers and clusters16 using hybrid DFT. The authors considered water
as the source of H atoms for the hydrogenation of CO2 and
described a reaction pathway from a carboxyl group (*COOH) to formic
acid, which was the rate-limiting step, and then onto formaldehyde
and finally methanol. This work would suggest other pathways for CO2 conversion beyond the dissociation into CO. In the work of
Favaro et al.,24 a model of Cu with subsurface
oxygen was required for copper to adsorb CO2 in the first
place and understand the experimental findings. However, despite these
advances, there still remains an urgent need from both a fundamental
and a technoeconomic perspective to discover new materials that can
activate and reduce CO2, in particular to produce sustainable
fuels, particularly if renewable energy can be used, either for electroreduction
or to produce renewable hydrogen from water.

Another popular
metal oxide is titanium dioxide, and the adsorption
of CO2 at different titania surfaces and nanostructures
has been widely studied. The roles of excess electrons introduced
by oxygen vacancies, low coordinated atomic sites, and the surface
structure in CO2 adsorption and activation have been discussed.30−32 The presence of excess electrons and holes was shown to influence
the adsorption and activation of CO2 at rutile (110), and
both bent CO2– anion and CO2+ cation configurations were identified from the DFT calculations.33 Lee and Kanai32 used
DFT to explore the difference between anatase (101) and a nanostructured
TiO2 quantum dot for CO2 activation and hydrogenation.
They found that the TiO2 quantum dot promoted CO2 activation and hydrogenation when compared to the extended anatase
(101) surface. Yang and colleagues showed that subnanometer Pt clusters
supported on the anatase (101) surface enhanced CO2 activation
through the provision of additional adsorption sites and the transfer
of electron density to the TiO2 substrate.34

Various other metal oxides have been investigated
for CO2 conversion, and several theoretical studies have
been conducted
into the reaction pathways involving the hydrogenation of CO and CO2 at a variety of catalytic surfaces, including Cu/CeO2 and Cu/CeO2/TiO217 or Cu/ZnO/Al2O3.35 An enhanced photoreduction of CO2 with H2O vapor has been reported for dispersed CeO2/TiO2.36 Here, the ceria is modeled
as a small cluster supported on rutile TiO2, similar to
the work on water gas shift,37−39 and the role of Ce3+ in visible light absorption, photogenerated charge separation, and
strengthening of the CO2–surface bonding was highlighted.

Recent experimental works from Rosenthal and co-workers40−43 and Walker et al.44 strongly suggest
that non-transition-metal based catalysts, in particular those containing
bismuth or tin, are able to activate CO2 or convert it
to other molecules with good efficiency. The catalysts in refs40,43 are composed
of Bi–glassy carbon and use ionic liquids or Bi nanoparticles,
which have large amounts of Bi3+. The former materials
can convert CO2 to alcohols with high efficiency, and even
though ionic liquids are used, the role of Bi in the catalyst remains
crucial to promote the conversion of CO2.

The bismuth
pyrochlore oxide Bi2Ti2O7 was studied
in ref (44) and was
shown to have high CO2 chemisorption
capacity. In this system, low-energy ion scattering (LEIS) shows clearly
that the surface layer is terminated by a bismuth oxide layer. This
surface structure arises from the well-known stereochemical lone pair
in Bi3+.45,46 By contrast, in the pyrochlore
Y2Ti2O7, there is no surface enrichment
with Y3+ (lacking the lone pair). This Bi-oxide-terminated
pyrochlore was examined for its capacity to adsorb and activate CO2 using infrared spectroscopy. The features in the infrared
spectrum corresponding to the adsorbed CO2 were clearly
present upon heating to 308 K. Y2Ti2O7, by contrast, does not strongly adsorb CO2. This suggests
that the adsorption of CO2 arises from the presence of
Bi3+ and a bismuth oxide surface layer in the pyrochlore
surface.

From the studies in refs,40,44 it is reasonable
to propose that the presence of
the Bi3+ cation, with its stereochemically active lone
pair, in a Bi-oxide structure will be active in promoting the interaction
of Bi-containing oxides with CO2. However, the mechanism
of CO2 adsorption and conversion on Bi3+-containing
materials, as a good exemplar of the p-block metal oxides, needs to
be further investigated, and this is one of the aims of this study.

Previously, we have used first-principles DFT simulations to design
heterostructured materials which are composed of TiO2 (rutile
or anatase) surfaces modified with metal oxide nanoclusters. In our
earlier work, the emphasis has been on new heterostructured materials
with predicted visible light absorption47−59 and reduced charge recombination.48−52,60−62 We have recently studied the interaction of molecules, such as CO2, with tin(II) oxide,47 zirconia,47 manganese oxide,63 alkaline earth oxide,64 and ceria65 nanocluster-modified TiO2 heterostructures.
We have found that such nanocluster-modified TiO2 heterostructures
can adsorb CO2,47 but that some
heterostructures, such as reduced MnOx–TiO2, do not show favorable CO2 adsorption,
even though reduced cations are present.63 There is still much work to be done to understand the factors that
drive CO2 activation on metal oxides.

In the present
paper, we take the ideas from the experimental work
on CO2 activation on Bi-containing materials, the ability
of nanostructures to activate CO2, and the activity of
nanocluster-modified TiO2 and use first-principles DFT
to examine in detail the interaction and adsorption of CO2 at Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified rutile and anatase
TiO2. We explore the role of the Bi-oxide, the
low coordinated sites in nanoclusters and reduction of the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures in CO2 adsorption and activation. In some examples, we examine
further interaction with hydrogen for the first steps in hydrogenation
and formation of intermediates such as COOH or HCOO. The role of heterostructure
reduction in CO2 activation is crucial, wherein the charge
transfer from the reduced oxide heterostructure can result in the
formation of a carboxylate or direct formation of CO.

2 Methods
In the DFT computations, we follow our approach
from previous work61 and prepare heterostructures
of Bi2O3 nanoclusters supported on the extended
low-energy rutile
(110) and anatase (101) surfaces; although other rutile and anatase
surfaces can be present in, for example, typical TiO2 nanoparticles,
these are the dominant surface facets and are well-studied.

All DFT computations use a three-dimensional periodic surface slab
within the VASP code66−69 and a plane-wave basis set to describe the valence electrons. Projector-augmented
wave potentials,70,71 with 4, 5, 6, 4, and 1 valence
electrons for Ti, Bi, O, C, and H, respectively, describe the core–valence
electron interactions, and this setup was extensively tested in our
earlier work on Bi2O3-modified TiO2.61 The cutoff for the kinetic energy
is 396 eV, and the exchange–correlation functional is the Perdew–Wang
9172 approximation. A Monkhorst–Pack
(2 × 1 × 1) k-point sampling grid is used.
For consistency with our previous work, we apply the DFT + U approach73,74 to describe the Ti 3d states,
with a value of U = 4.5 eV. The convergence criteria
for the electronic and ionic relaxations are 0.0001 eV and 0.02 eV/Å.
Methfessel–Paxton smearing is used with σ = 0.1 eV (also
for the broadening of the peaks in the projected density of states).
We use the Newton–Raphson relaxation algorithm, and all calculations
are spin-polarized throughout, with no constraints on the spin.

The rutile (110) surface is terminated by twofold coordinated bridging
O atoms, with threefold coordinated in-plane oxygen atoms in the surface
layer. In the same layer, the Ti atoms take fivefold and sixfold coordinations.
The anatase (101) surface is characterized by twofold coordinated
oxygen atoms terminating the surface layer, and the outermost Ti atoms
are fivefold coordinated. Surface supercell expansions of (2 ×
4) and (4 × 2) are employed for rutile and anatase, respectively,
and the vacuum gap in all cases is 12 Å.

In forming these
composite structures, we first relax the gas-phase
metal oxide nanoclusters and the unmodified rutile and anatase surfaces
using the same computational setup described above. The oxide nanocluster
modifier is adsorbed at the TiO2 surfaces in different
configurations, and each of these are relaxed, as described in refs.48,57,61,75 We selected
the most stable Bi2O3–TiO2 composites for the study of CO2 activation in the present
paper. We will use the term Bi2O3–TiO2 throughout this paper to indicate the general Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified TiO2 heterostructure,
using the precise nanocluster composition and TiO2 surface
when necessary.

The stability of the heterostructure is characterized
by the computed
nanocluster adsorption energy, Eads 1  where E[(Bi2O3)n–TiO2] is
the computed total energy of the Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified
TiO2 surface (in which n is the number
of Bi2O3 units in the nanocluster, so that in
this paper n = 2 or 3), E[(Bi2O3)n] is the computed
total energy of the free (Bi2O3)n nanocluster, and E[(TiO2)] is the computed total energy of the unmodified TiO2 (rutile/anatase) surface.

The reduction of the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures is studied
by removing oxygen from the nanocluster
modifier (which is always more stable than removing oxygen from the
TiO2 support) and computing the formation energy of the
oxygen vacancy as follows 2  where E{((Bi2O3–x)–TiO2) is the
total energy of the Bi2O3–TiO2 composite with one oxygen removed and 1/2E(O2) is the reference energy for oxygen, namely half the total
energy of the O2 molecule. We correct the oxygen vacancy
formation energy for entropy, which, at 298 K, is 0.60 eV. Despite
the known errors in the DFT energy of the reference O2 molecule,
the trends in oxygen vacancy formation are independent
of this error. We also use ab initio thermodynamics to determine the
stability of the reduced Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures formed by removing oxygen over a range of
temperatures.

To analyze the stability of the reduced heterostructured
models
when exposed to an environment of oxygen, we use the DFT-derived total
energies as an input into an atomistic thermodynamics framework, which
considers the effect of the surrounding gas phase as a reservoir that
is in thermodynamic equilibrium with the heterostructure. If we assume
that the oxygen reservoir exchanges particles with the system without
affecting its chemical potential, the oxygen vacancy formation energy
is calculated as follows 3  where E(Bi2O3−δ–TiO2) and E(Bi2O3–TiO2) are the total
DFT energies of the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures with and without the oxygen vacancy, NO is the number of oxygen atoms removed, and μO(p,T) is the chemical potential
of oxygen. Approximating oxygen as an ideal gas, we explicitly introduce
pressure and temperature in our model through the analytic relation
between the chemical potentials and the temperature and pressure of
the two gas reservoirs as follows 4  Here, T and p represent the temperature and partial pressure
of oxygen, p0 denotes atmospheric pressure,
and kB is the Boltzmann constant. μ′
is the energetic term that includes contributions from the rotations
and vibrations of the molecule, as well as the ideal-gas entropy at
1 atm, which can be calculated or taken from the experimental values
listed in the thermodynamic tables. Thus, for a given pressure, the
stability of oxygen vacancies can be determined over a range of temperatures.

The CO2 adsorption energy at Bi2O3-modified TiO2 heterostructures is defined in eq 5 5  where E(CO2@(Bi2O3)n–TiO2) is the computed
total energy of the relaxed adsorption structure
of CO2 at Bi2O3-modified TiO2 composites, whether stoichiometric or reduced. We examined
many CO2 adsorption structures, and those shown in the
following text are the most stable that we have found. Although van
der Waals corrections can be added to these computations, we have
tested and found that the change in the adsorption energies is ca.
0.15 eV, which is not significant compared to the magnitude of the
computed CO2 adsorption energies, and furthermore, there
is no effect of the inclusion of vdW corrections on the relative stability
of different CO2 adsorption structures.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Bi2O3-Modified Rutile
and Anatase TiO2 Heterostructures
Figure 1 shows the atomic structures
of the nanocluster-modified anatase (101) and rutile (110) surfaces
of Bi4O6 and Bi6O9. We
have described these heterostructured systems in detail in previous
work,61 and we briefly summarize the key
features required for this paper. The adsorption energies can be computed
relative to the corresponding gas-phase stoichiometric Bi2O3 nanoclusters, and these are −5.18, −5.18,
and −5.72 eV for Bi4O6-rutile, Bi6O9-rutile, and Bi4O6-anatase,
respectively. If we consider these energies in terms of the deposition
of the nanoclusters at very low loading/coverage through atomic layer
deposition, chemisorption–calcination, or incipient wetness
impregnation, then the above energies can be related to the desorption
of the Bi2O3 nanoclusters from the TiO2 supports. The magnitude of the computed energies indicates a strong
binding of the nanocluster modifiers at both TiO2 surfaces
and suggests they would only desorb at very high temperatures.

rutile (110) and anatase (101). (a) Bi4O6-rutile
(110), (b) Bi6O9-rutile (110), and (c) Bi4O6-anatase (101). The color coding in this and
subsequent figures is Ti = light gray sphere, O = red sphere, and
Bi = purple sphere. Bi and O atoms in the adsorbed nanoclusters are
depicted by larger radius spheres.

We can also consider the stability against sintering into
larger
nanoclusters. In the gas phase, the gain in energy when two nanoclusters
of composition Bi2O3 coalesce into a larger
Bi4O6 nanocluster is −6.1 eV, and the
coalescence of a gas-phase Bi2O3 and a gas-phase
Bi4O6 nanocluster results in a gain of 3.1 eV.
On the surface, we use the total energies of the bismuth oxide nanocluster-modified
rutile heterostructures to assess the nanocluster stability against
coalescence into larger nanoclusters.75 For the example of Bi2O3 and Bi4O6 coalescing to a Bi6O9 nanocluster  

The computed energy is +2.69 eV against coalescence of the
two
smaller nanoclusters supported on rutile (110). Thus, when the Bi2O3 nanoclusters are supported on rutile or anatase,
they will be stable against desorption or aggregation. The high stability
of the supported Bi2O3 nanoclusters is primarily
driven by the formation of new interfacial bonds between the nanocluster
and the surface. We also note that the extensive work of Graciani
et al. on ceria–TiO2 used small Ce2O3 species supported on rutile (110),38,39 which were also shown to be highly stable.

On Bi4O6-rutile, two Bi cations bind to the
bridging surface oxygen, with typical Bi–O distances of 2.17
Å. These Bi cations are threefold coordinated, whereas the remaining
Bi cations are twofold coordinated. Three oxygen atoms from the nanocluster
bind to the fivefold coordinated Ti surface atoms, with the Ti–O
distances in the range of 1.83–2.05 Å. In the Bi6O9-rutile nanocluster, one Bi cation binds to a bridging
oxygen, with a Bi–O distance of 2.37 Å. Two oxygen atoms
from the nanocluster bind to the surface Ti atoms, with the Ti–O
distances of 1.94 and 1.86 Å. Here, the terminal Bi cations,
furthest away from the cluster–surface interface, are threefold
coordinated, and there are twofold coordinated oxygen sites in the
nanocluster.

In Bi4O6-anatase, three Bi
cations bind to
the surface oxygen, with the Bi–O distances of 2.14, 2.14,
2.24, and 2.17 Å. The two Bi cations furthest away from the cluster–surface
interface are threefold coordinated and the remaining Bi cations are
fourfold coordinated. Four oxygen atoms in the nanocluster bind to
the surface Ti, with the distances Ti–O in the range of 1.87–2.06
Å. There are three twofold coordinated oxygen sites: one is the
terminal oxygen in the nanocluster and the remaining two sites bridge
the nanocluster and the anatase (101) surface.

The other important
aspect of the Bi2O3–TiO2 composites
for the interaction with CO2 is their
electronic properties, and in Figure 2 we show the projected electronic density of states
(PEDOS) for the Bi2O3-rutile and Bi2O3-anatase systems. Bi3+ is an interesting
species as it has a stereochemically active lone pair, which results
in the presence of Bi-derived electronic states at the top of the
valence band. This gives rise to the distorted structure of bulk Bi2O346 and the Bi-rich
surface region in the pyrochlore Bi2Ti2O7.44 The other metal oxides with
+3 cations do not show these structural distortions.

Figure 2 PEDOS projected onto
the Bi 6s, Ti 3d, and O 2p states (nanocluster
and surface) for (a) Bi4O6 rutile (110), (b)
Bi6O9-rutile (110), and (c) Bi4O6-anatase (101). The zero of energy in all cases is the Fermi
level. The left panels show the cation PEDOS and the right panels
show the oxygen 2p PEDOS.

In the PEDOS of the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures, the Bi electronic states are present at
the valence band edge of all the composite systems studied. For modified
rutile (110), we see Bi (6s + 6p) and O 2p states originating from
the nanoclusters lying at a higher energy than the corresponding TiO2 valence and conduction band edges, which should result in
a small red shift in light absorption. For anatase, the Bi2O3-derived states lie just below the anatase valence band
edge, which results in no predicted red shift. The key finding is
that the Bi states lie at the top of the valence band edge, and this
can be important in the reduction or CO2 adsorption on
the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures.

Finally, we present the results for the reduction of the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures. The
reduced heterostructures are prepared by removing oxygen atoms from
the Bi2O3 nanoclusters and computing the oxygen
vacancy formation energy. From a practical perspective, reduction
can be facilitated by a thermochemical process using concentrated
solar radiation or by the introduction of hydrogen in a redox process.
Relaxing the structure after the removal of oxygen, the most stable
reduced heterostructures are shown in Figure 3. The computed formation energies for the
most stable oxygen vacancy sites are 1.75 eV (1.12 eV) for Bi4O6-rutile (110), 1.64 eV (1.01 eV) for Bi6O9-rutile (110), and 3.0 eV (2.37 eV) for Bi4O6-anatase (101), where the formation energies corrected
for TΔS at 298 K are given
in parentheses. These formation energies that show a moderate cost
for oxygen vacancy formation in the supported Bi2O3 nanoclusters are notably smaller than that on the corresponding
bare TiO2 surfaces (3.5 eV for rutile (110) and 3.6–4.1
eV for anatase (101)76), so that reduction
should be possible under moderate conditions. The other oxygen sites
have formation energies larger than 2 eV on Bi4O6-rutile and between 3.4 and 3.7 eV on Bi4O6-anatase. Figure 4 shows the stability of the most stable oxygen vacancy sites in each
heterostructure as a function of temperature at a pressure of 1 atm.
From this plot, we can see that reduction should take place at 500–600
K, which is certainly feasible in the context of CO2 reduction/conversion
processes. For the rutile-supported Bi6O9 nanocluster,
the larger formation energy of the vacancy clearly results in a higher
temperature for vacancy formation, although this is still notably
lower than that on bare rutile (110).

electrons/Å3. The color coding of the atoms is the
same as in Figure 1.

Bi2O3-modified TiO2 as a function

a pressure of 1 atm.

After the reduction of the Bi2O3 nanoclusters,
the local atomic structure shows some changes. On Bi4O6-rutile (110), the removal of oxygen results in the formation
of a structure that shows symmetry, with two twofold coordinated oxygen
atoms terminating the nanocluster. The Bi cations are threefold coordinated,
and each Bi atom binds to a bridging oxygen atom from the rutile (110)
surface, with the Bi–O distances in the range of 2.17–2.18
Å. Furthermore, each Bi atom also coordinates to one oxygen from
the nanocluster, which itself binds to a surface Ti atom, with the
Bi–O distances of 2.07–2.15 Å and Ti–O distances
of 2.03 Å.

On Bi6O9-rutile, the formation
of the most
stable oxygen vacancy results in small changes to the nanocluster
structure. Two Bi cations are coordinated to the surface-bridging
oxygen sites, with the Bi–O distances of 2.20–2.23 Å.
Two nanocluster oxygen bind to the surface fivefold coordinated Ti,
with the Ti–O distances of 1.89 and 2.02 Å, whereas after
relaxation, four oxygen atoms take a twofold coordination environment
by breaking the bonds with Bi cations (giving long Bi–O distances
of 2.51 and 2.56 Å).

On Bi4O6-anatase,
two Bi cations are threefold
coordinated and the remaining cations are fourfold coordinated. The
typical Bi–O distances range from 1.86 to 2.15 Å, and
the Bi–O distances to the surface range from 2.12 to 2.16 Å.
One oxygen atom from the surface migrates outward to bind to a Bi
cation in the nanocluster, with three oxygen atoms in the nanocluster
binding to the surface Ti sites; the Bi–O distances are in
the range 1.86–1.90 Å.

The localization of the two
electrons released upon removal of
the neutral oxygen atom is shown by the spin density isosurfaces in Figure 3. For both Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified rutile (110) composites,
the electrons preferentially localize on the Ti sites in the rutile
(110) surface, with the computed Ti Bader charges of +1.65/1.71 electrons
in Bi4O6-rutile and +1.65/1.69 electrons in
Bi6O9-rutile and spin magnetization in the range
0.92–0.94 μB. For reference, Ti4+ cations have computed Bader charges of +1.30 electrons and zero
spin magnetization. The first electron localizes on a subsurface Ti
site and the second electron localizes onto a surface fivefold coordinated
Ti site that has no interaction with the supported nanocluster. These
values are typical of the reduced Ti3+ species in rutile
(110).

In contrast, on Bi4O6-anatase (101),
the
two electrons localize on a surface fivefold coordinated Ti3+ site and on a Bi site in the nanocluster, which results in the formation
of a reduced Bi2+ species. The computed Bader charges are
+1.74 electrons on Ti and +2.99 electrons on Bi; the latter is comparable
to a computed Bi Bader charge of +2.1 electrons for Bi3+ cations, indicating the reduction of the Bi species. The computed spin magnetizations on Ti and Bi are 0.96 and 0.7
μB. This Bi site binds to the oxygen that migrated
out of the surface, and this particular oxygen bridges the two reduced
Ti3+ and Bi2+ sites.

3.2 Adsorption
of CO2 at Reduced Bi2O3–TiO2 Heterostructures
We now discuss the adsorption of
CO2 at the Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified
TiO2 heterostructures,
and in this section we focus on the reduced heterostructures. We examined
the interaction of the reduced Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures with CO2 in a number of adsorption
configurations. Figure 5 shows the most stable relaxed structures after the relaxation of
adsorbed CO2 on each reduced Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructure. The computed interaction
energies for CO2 are −0.45 eV on reduced Bi4O6-rutile (110), −0.53 eV on reduced Bi6O9-rutile (110), and −0.93 eV on reduced
Bi4O6-anatase (101). These energies indicate
a moderately strong interaction between the initially reduced metal
oxide heterostructure and the CO2 molecule.

most stable CO2 adsorption structures
on reduced Bi2O3–TiO2 composites:
(a) Bi4O6-rutile (110), (b) Bi6O9-rutile (110), and (c) Bi4O6-anatase
(101). The color coding is the same as in Figure 1, with an additional inclusion of a gray
sphere for carbon. The Bi and O atoms in the supported Bi2O3 nanoclusters are depicted with larger diameter spheres.

CO2 binds to reduced
Bi4O6-rutile
(110) with the formation of two Bi–O bonds, with the Bi–O
distances of 2.45 and 2.52 Å. The carbon of CO2 binds
to the oxygen in the nanocluster, with a C–O distance of 1.38
Å. The C–O distances in the adsorbed CO2 are
elongated to 1.27 Å, and the O–C–O angle is 130°.
Thus, the CO2 molecule adsorbs moderately exothermically
on the reduced supported Bi4O6 nanocluster in
a manner that can be considered carbonate-like with a tridentate adsorption
configuration, although one of the C–O bonds is significantly
longer than the typical C–O carbonate distance.

Examining
the electronic structure in the CO2–Bi4O6-rutile system, the computed Bader charges on
the previously reduced Ti atoms are now +1.3 electrons, signifying
the presence of oxidized Ti4+ species. Interestingly, we
find that the charge on two Bi cations in the nanocluster changes
to 2.8 and 3.2 electrons, indicating that these Bi cations are partially
reduced. One of these Bi cations binds to the oxygen of CO2, suggesting a rearrangement of charge upon CO2 adsorption.

On Bi6O9-rutile (110), the relaxation of
initially adsorbed CO2 leads to spontaneous breaking of
a C–O bond in the molecule, which results in the release of
a free CO molecule, with no energy barrier to this process. Although
one might expect a significant energy gain in breaking a C–O
bond, we have to consider that this process heals the vacancy site
on the Bi2O3 nanocluster, which has a high stability,
and there would also be an energy cost to break the C–O bond
in the molecule. In any case, the key point is the exothermic release
of CO.

When CO is released, the previous supported Bi6O8 nanocluster is reoxidized, with the Bi6O9 composition. Examining the atomic structure, we see that
the free
CO has a C–O distance of 1.14 Å, which is typical of the
gas-phase CO, and the Bi–O distances are similar to those in
the stoichiometric Bi6O9-rutile system. In the
Bi6O9-rutile system, the computed Bader charges
of Ti and Bi are +1.3 and +2.2 electrons, consistent with the presence
of only oxidized Ti4+ and Bi3+ species. The
electrons on the TiO2 surface after reduction are therefore
transferred to CO2 to allow the formation of new Bi–O
bonds and a free CO molecule.

To examine this in more detail
and complete a redox cycle, we adsorb
H2 at the site of the oxygen species that results from
CO2 dissociation, that is, oxygen that reoxidized reduced
Bi6O8-rutile. Upon relaxation, a water molecule
spontaneously forms, with an exothermic energy gain of 1.13 eV which
reduces the Bi6O9 nanocluster; removal of water
from the supercell requires 0.43 eV, and the reduced supported nanocluster
is available for reaction with another CO2. Thus, the Bi6O9 nanocluster supported on rutile TiO2 appears to show a pathway for CO2 dissociation through
a redox process involving water formation in a reverse water gas shift-like
process.

Finally, on Bi4O6-anatase (101),
the computed
Bader charges on the CO2 molecule indicate a charge transfer
of ca. 1.5 electrons to the molecule from the reduced composite. The
computed Bader charges of 1.3 and 2.1 electrons on previously reduced
Ti and Bi further support this electron transfer, which reoxidises
Ti and Bi. This process then results in the formation and stabilization
of a carboxyl, CO2– species. This is
one of the activated CO2 species that is important in CO2 conversion. In the gas phase, the potential required for
the formation of CO2– is prohibitively
high, but in the reduced Bi2O3-modified anatase
system, the presence of both low coordinated active sites and excess
electrons after reduction appears to facilitate electron transfer
to the adsorbed CO2 molecule. In adsorbed carboxyl, the
C–O distances are 1.25 and 1.27 Å, again showing a significant
elongation over the free molecule. The bending of CO2 upon
interaction with the nanocluster is also apparent, with an O–C–O
angle of 130°. CO2 binds to the nanocluster through
a Bi–O bond, which has a distance of 2.42 Å and a Bi–C
bond of 2.37 Å involving a second Bi atom in the nanocluster.

The computed vibrational frequencies for CO2 adsorbed
on reduced heterostructures are shown in Table 1. The computed gas-phase vibrational modes
of CO2 are 2354, 1325, and 632 cm–1,
with the latter being degenerate. These correspond to the asymmetric
C=O stretch, the symmetric C=O stretch, and the O–C–O
bending mode. The large red shift in the C=O stretching mode
of 760 and 767 cm–1 on Bi4O6-rutile and Bi4O6-anatase is consistent with
the strong adsorption of CO2, as is the breaking of the
degeneracy in the CO2 bending mode upon adsorption. We
note that on Bi4O6-anatase the splitting of
the degeneracy in the CO2 bending mode is larger, the origin
of which is likely due to one oxygen of CO2 not binding
with the Bi2O3 nanocluster. By contrast, the
two oxygen atoms in CO2 bind with the nanocluster in Bi4O6-rutile, so that the split in the degeneracy
of the two modes is smaller.

symmetric stretch), and 667 cm–1 (C=O bonding,
degenerate).

In addition
to the excess electrons introduced by reduction and
the presence of Bi–O electronic states at the top of the valence
band, the atomic structure of the supported Bi2O3 nanoclusters can facilitate CO2 adsorption because of
the presence of low coordinated atomic sites and the flexibility in
these supported nanoclusters that allows strong relaxations after
the adsorption of molecules. We can also relate these findings to
the work of Walker et al.44 on the Bi-containing
pyrochlore. In this system, the surface is terminated by a Bi–O
layer, similar to our Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified
TiO2, and the Bi 6s/6p electronic states are mixed with
O 2p states at the top of the valence band. Thus, the pyrochlore has
a suitable electronic structure to permit interaction with CO2 and an atomic structure that also facilitates the interaction
with CO2.

Given that the adsorption of CO2 is the crucial first
step in the catalytic conversion of CO2, which is generally
not favorable or could form highly stable carbonates on metal oxides,
our finding that CO2 interacts moderately strongly with
the reducible Bi2O3-modified TiO2 and can form CO or a carboxyl intermediate is a key result of this
work.

3.3 CO2 Adsorption at Oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 Heterostructures
Table 2 presents the
computed adsorption energies of the two most stable adsorption configurations
of CO2 at each oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructure, and Figure 6 shows the relaxed atomic structures for these CO2 adsorption configurations. From Table 2, we can see that there is at least one moderately
strong interacting CO2 adsorption configuration at each
Bi2O3– TiO2 heterostructure,
with the computed adsorption energies of −0.54, −1.01,
and −0.82 eV on Bi4O6-rutile, Bi6O9-rutile, and Bi4O6-anatase,
respectively. Compared to the computed adsorption energies of CO2 on other oxidized metal oxide-modified TiO2 systems,
for example, in ref (47) or on polymorphs of TiO2 itself,10,30,31 the adsorption energies of CO2 on Bi2O3-modified TiO2 are notably
stronger, indicating that these heterostructures are more favorable
toward CO2 adsorption, although we note that there is no
direct formation of CO or carboxylate, suggesting that the oxidized
Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures
may facilitate CO2 capture.

Examining the atomic structures for the adsorbed CO2, we see that there are adsorption configurations on Bi6O9-rutile and Bi4O6-anatase,
namely
the configurations in Figure 6c,e, which have the weakest interactions and show a linear CO2 that is unchanged
from the gas phase. This is a CO2 physisorption mode, which
we do not expect to be important.

The other adsorption modes
in Figure 6 are of
more interest, and these show new
C–O interactions with the supported nanoclusters, and the adsorption
structure is consistent with a carbonate-like adsorption mode, albeit
without the strong stabilization usually found for carbonate adsorption,64,65 and consistent with the CO2 adsorption on the Bi-oxide-terminated
pyrochlore.44

Table 3 presents
the important C–O distances, O–C–O bending angles,
and the computed CO2 vibrational modes. The common feature
of these adsorption modes of CO2 is that the molecule is
clearly bent (gas-phase CO2 is linear, with an O–C–O
angle of 180°). The O–C–O angles in the adsorbed
CO2 are 131°, 127°, and 130° on Bi4O6-rutile, Bi6O9-rutile, and Bi4O6-anatase. This is consistent with the bending
of activated CO2 observed on other materials, including
transition-metal carbides, or on ceria-modified rutile (110).4,77,78

a The first two C–O
distances
in column 2 are in the adsorbed molecule and the third C–O
distance is to oxygen in the Bi2O3 nanocluster.
Our computed vibrational frequencies of free CO2 are 2354,
1325, and 632 cm–1, with the latter being degenerate.

On Bi4O6-rutile, the C–O distances
in the adsorbed CO2 elongate to 1.26 and 1.27 Å, whereas
the C–O distance to nanocluster oxygen is 1.39 Å. This
is a notable elongation in the C–O distances over those in
the gas-phase molecule (which is 1.16 Å). Similarly, on Bi6O9-rutile, the resulting bidentate adsorption configuration
has elongated C–O distances of 1.26 and 1.29 Å in the
molecule, whereas the C–O distance to the nanocluster is 1.39
Å. On Bi4O6-anatase, the carbon atom binds
in a monodentate fashion to one oxygen in the nanocluster, with a
C–O distance of 1.39 Å, whereas the C–O distances
in the molecule are 1.26 and 1.27 Å.

Clearly, on Bi2O3-modified TiO2, although the CO2 molecule does not adsorb in a typical
carbonate adsorption mode in which the three C–O distances
are equal (∼1.29 Å) and the O–C–O angles
are 120°, we can nonetheless describe the adsorption as carbonate-like.
Although a new C–O interaction with a C–O distance of
1.39 Å is present, we can propose that this interaction participates
in helping to stabilize the adsorbed CO2, so that it can
further interact with hydrogen (see Section 3.3).

We have also computed the vibrational
modes of adsorbed CO2 on Bi2O3-modified
TiO2.
Upon the adsorption of CO2 at the oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures, there are
significant red shifts in the asymmetric C=O stretch of 737,
823, and 761 cm–1 on Bi4O6-rutile, Bi6O9-rutile, and Bi4O6-anatase, respectively. The degeneracy of the O–C–O
bending mode is lifted upon adsorption at Bi2O3–TiO2. CO2 adsorbed on Bi6O9-rutile shows the largest red shift of the C=O
stretch, which is consistent with its larger adsorption energy and
distortions away from the gas-phase CO2 geometry. This
shift in the C=O stretching mode correlates with the strength
of the CO2–Bi2O3–TiO2 interaction, and it has been observed in the experimental
studies of CO2 adsorption on a range of materials.79−81

Finally, we briefly examine the electronic structure. Figure 7 shows the PEDOS
for C and O atoms in CO2, and Ti and Bi atoms, as the examples
of CO2 adsorbed on Bi6O9-rutile and
Bi4O6-anatase. In both cases, the CO2-derived C 2p and O 2p electronic states lie at the top of the valence
band. Furthermore, there is a strong interaction between the Bi 6s/6p
states and the carbon and oxygen 2p states of CO2. This
is consistent with the strong interaction and distortion of CO2 when adsorbed at the supported Bi2O3 nanoclusters. We have also computed the Bader atomic charges upon
CO2 adsorption. These do not show a significant charge
transfer between Bi2O3–TiO2 and CO2, indicating that there is no charge transfer
upon the adsorption of CO2.

Figure 7 PEDOS projected onto
the Ti 3d, Bi 6s/6p, and CO2 2p
states after the adsorption of CO2 onto (a) Bi6O9-rutile and (b) Bi4O6-anatase.

In understanding the strong CO2 adsorption without any
significant charge transfer, we consider the atomic and electronic
structures of Bi2O3 nanocluster-modified TiO2. The nature of the valence band of Bi2O3–TiO2, with high-lying Bi2O3-derived electronic states, permits the interaction of these Bi–O
electronic states with the C and O atoms of CO2. This can
be considered similar to the case of the alkaline earth oxides, which
show increased basicity and higher energy valence band states on going
from Mg to Ca to Ba, and the interaction with CO2 is stronger
with the increased basic character along this series.

3.4 Hydrogenation of Adsorbed CO2
Starting from
the CO2 adsorption structures in Section 3.3, which show
moderate adsorption energies and distortions to CO2 but
no direct CO formation, we first examined the dissociation and formation
of CO and adsorbed oxygen. However, such starting structures relax
back to those already described, and if we remove CO, this is endothermic
by up to 3 eV.

We have therefore examined the first steps in
hydrogenation to explore if the adsorbed CO2 species can
be hydrogenated. We focus on Bi4O6-rutile and
Bi4O6-anatase, with the most favorable CO2 adsorption modes discussed above. We adsorb a hydrogen atom
at the Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructure
to simulate the dissociation of H2 and the formation of
a hydroxyl on the nanocluster. We then use the climbing image NEB
method with three images to determine the activation barrier for H
migration, from which either a formate or carboxyl species can be
produced.

Figure 8a,b shows
the structure of the H atom adsorbed as a hydroxyl on Bi4O6-rutile and Bi4O6-anatase. The
energy gain relative to 1/2 H2 (in gas phase) is 1.42 eV
on Bi4O6-rutile and 0.63 eV on Bi4O6-anatase. These are moderate energy gains for hydrogen
adsorption. Upon H adsorption at Bi4O6-rutile,
the O–H distance is 0.98 Å, and the Bi–O distances
involving this oxygen are 2.25 and 2.44 Å. On Bi4O6-anatase, the O–H distance is 1.01 Å, and the
Bi–O distances for this oxygen are 2.31 and 2.18 Å.

by the white sphere. (b) Atomic structure of a hydroxyl species on

of the transition state for H migration to adsorbed CO2 on Bi4O6-anatase. (e) Atomic structure of
a COOH intermediate on Bi4O6-rutile. (f) Atomic
structure of a COOH intermediate on Bi4O6-anatase.

The computed barrier for H migration
from the hydroxyl to oxygen
in CO2 to form a carboxyl intermediate is 0.77 eV on Bi4O6-rutile (110) and 0.68 eV on Bi4O6-anatase (101). These are moderate barriers for the H transfer
to the adsorbed CO2. The atomic structure of the transition
state is shown in Figure 8c,d. In the transition state on Bi4O6-rutile, the H atom has migrated away from the nanocluster toward
the oxygen of the adsorbed CO2. On Bi4O6-anatase, the transition state involves the H atom migrating
away from the oxygen of the nanocluster by 0.25 Å toward CO2.

The atomic structure of the carboxyl intermediate
on Bi4O6-rutile and Bi4O6-anatase is shown
in Figure 8e,f. For
the COOH intermediates, the C=O, C–O(H), OH, and C–O(Bi)
distances are presented in Table 4. We also examined the formation of a formate intermediate.
However, formate either lies higher by ca. 3 eV, on Bi4O6-rutile, or is not stable, relaxing to COOH on Bi4O6-anatase, and thus the COOH intermediate is preferred.
If we introduce a second hydrogen atom to make COOH2, this
always relaxes to water and CO2, removing oxygen from the
Bi2O3 nanocluster, and thus we conclude that
although CO2 can adsorb at the oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 nanoclusters, it is difficult to hydrogenate
to useful products.

4 Conclusions
We have
studied the interaction and activation of CO2 at the novel
heterostructure of Bi2O3 nanoclusters
supported on rutile and anatase TiO2 surfaces. Previous
experimental work has demonstrated that Bi-containing materials can
activate and convert CO2 to more useful molecules, but
the origin of this is not yet clear.

The Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures
can be reduced, with moderate energy costs, which should be possible
through a thermochemical process or by the addition of hydrogen. This
results in the reduction of Ti sites, and Bi sites in the nanocluster
can also be reduced. The interaction of the reduced heterostructures
with CO2 can result in direct exothermic CO formation,
or charge transfer to CO2 (reoxidizing Bi and Ti cations),
to give an activated carboxylate species. The CO can be removed, and
the addition of hydrogen is an exothermic process that forms water
and reduces the nanocluster. This suggests a promising approach for
CO2 conversion via CO.

We find that CO2 adsorbs moderately strongly at the
oxidized Bi2O3–TiO2 heterostructures,
with the computed adsorption energies ranging from −0.54 to
1.01 eV; van der Waals interactions simply shift these energies by
ca. 0.15 eV, but do not change the overall trends. CO2 adsorbs
in a carbonate-like adsorption mode (but is not overstabilized), with
no charge transfer to the molecule. Finally, the computed vibrational
modes of the adsorbed CO2 show a significant red shift
of over 750 cm–1 in the C=O stretching mode
and a breaking of the degeneracy in the O–C–O bending
mode. The magnitude of the red shift in the C=O stretching
mode correlates with the strength of the adsorption of CO2. The position of the high-lying valence band states derived from
Bi3+–O interactions appear to drive the activation
of CO2.

We find that the CO2 adsorbed
in this fashion can be
hydrogenated to a COOH intermediate, with the migration barriers from
the nanocluster to the adsorbed CO2 of less than 0.8 eV,
whereas CO2 dissociation is not favorable. However, further
hydrogenation of COOH does not result in any useful products, and
we conclude that reduction is the key to the activation and subsequent
conversion of CO2 on Bi2O3-modified
TiO2 heterostructures.

These results show that the
unique properties of bismuth-containing
oxides can be exploited to adsorb and activate carbon dioxide, which
is the key first step in the reductive conversion of CO2 to useful molecules. The combination of a non-bulk-like nanocluster-containing
Bi3+ species, which is reducible, provides an interesting
material that can activate CO2, whether that be by strong
adsorption and distortion, electron transfer to form a carboxylate,
or by direct breaking of a C–O bond, and we propose that these
heterostructures can be synthesized and tested for CO2 activation.
