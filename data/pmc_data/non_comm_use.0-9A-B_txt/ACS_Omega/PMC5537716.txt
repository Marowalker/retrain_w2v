The
PhoP–PhoR two-component system is essential for the
virulence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and therefore represents a potential target
for developing novel antituberculosis therapies. However, little is
known about the mechanism by which this two-component system regulates
the virulence. In this study, we demonstrated that a phoR mutant Mtb strain has phenotypes similar to those
of a phoP mutant, suggesting that PhoP and PhoR work
in the same pathway to regulate Mtb virulence. We
determined the structure of the dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer
(DHp) domain of PhoR to a 1.9 Å resolution. The structure revealed
that the DHp domain is a dimer. Each subunit consists of two antiparallel
α helices connected by a loop of five residues. The two subunits
of the dimer fold into a four-helical bundle with a continuous hydrophobic
core. The topology of the four-helical bundle is identical to the
histidine kinases that are known to have a cis-autophosphorylation
mechanism, suggesting that PhoR is likely to autophosphorylate in
cis. The dimer is asymmetric, with one subunit having a greater bending
angle than the other at the highly conserved proline residue five-residues
downstream of the phosphorylation site histidine. This structural
asymmetry of the dimer suggests the flexibility of the PhoR DHp domain,
which is likely to be important for the signal transduction mechanism
in controlling the autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer reactions
and communicating with the upstream structure.

Introduction
Two-component regulatory
systems (TCSs) are major signaling systems
in bacteria and are essential for bacterial adaptation to the environments,
including the ability to evade host immune response and to develop
drug resistance in pathogenic bacteria. Because TCSs are absent from
mammals, they are attractive targets for developing new antibiotics.1,2 The PhoP–PhoR TCS of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is essential for virulence,3 although the signals that this TCS responds to are still
unknown. Tuberculosis (TB) remains as one of the most serious threats
to public health because of the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant
and extensive drug-resistant TB and the synergy of TB with HIV infection.4 In 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million
new cases of TB, and 1.8 million people died from TB, including 400 000
people who were also HIV positive.5

In the Mtb PhoP–PhoR TCS, PhoR is a transmembrane
sensor histidine kinase (HK), and PhoP is a response regulator (RR)
that affects the expression of more than 110 genes.6−8 Mutant strains
of Mtb with the phoP gene or both phoPR genes disrupted are severely attenuated in macrophage
and mice, and several studies have proposed to develop an attenuated
live vaccine based on the phoP-null mutant strains.9,10 The phoPR genes are in a single operon, suggesting
that the PhoPR proteins are likely to be an obligate cognate pair
of TCS proteins.11 The gene encoding PhoR
is located downstream of phoP, and the open-reading
frames are separated by 45 base pairs.12 In vitro studies have demonstrated the ability of PhoR to phosphorylate
PhoP.13 However, data of the phoR function in vivo are still lacking. PhoR is a membrane-associated
protein with an extracytosolic sensory domain of 123 residues.3 This topological feature may make PhoR a more
accessible target than the intracellular PhoP.

PhoR is expected
to be a homodimer with a modular domain structure,3 each subunit consisting of two transmembrane
helices flanking an extracytosolic sensor domain at the N-terminus,
followed by a HAMP (found in HKs, adenyl cyclases, methyl-accepting
chemotaxis proteins, and phosphatases) domain, a DHp (dimerization
and histidine phosphotransfer) domain, and a CA (catalytic and ATP-binding)
domain in the cytosol. Although it is well-established that the PhoPR
TCS plays an important role in the virulence of Mtb, little data are available for the PhoR protein. However, some of
the basic functions and signaling mechanisms can be inferred from
studies of homologous HKs.14 HKs sense
environmental signals through the sensor domain. The signals are propagated
across the cellular membrane to the cytosolic portion through some
still undefined conformational changes that turn on the kinase activity
and autophosphorylate on the conserved histidine. The phosphoryl group
is then transferred to a cognate RR, which then generates cellular
responses, in most of the cases by regulating gene transcription.
There are available structural information on several related HKs,
such as EnvZ,15 DesK,16 and HK853.17 The overall sequence
identity of PhoR to these HKs is low, that is, <30%. There are,
however, well-conserved sequence motifs and a pattern of heptad repeats
of hydrophobicity in the helical bundle domains.14

The DHp domain is the center of the HK function.
It harbors the
phosphorylation site histidine and interacts with the ATP-binding
domain for autophosphorylation, interacts with the cognate RR for
the phosphotransfer reaction to activate the RR, and receives signals
through upstream domains from the external sensor domain to control
the phosphorylation activities. The DHp domain makes up a large portion
of the HK dimer interface. The DHp domain also harbors the binding
site for the RR, and thus, its structure determines the fidelity of
cognate pairs of HK and RR.17

In
this work, we demonstrated the contribution of the PhoR HK to
the roles of the PhoPR TCS in Mtb virulence. The
results suggested that the PhoPR proteins are obligate cognate partners
in a TCS. We presented the crystal structure of the DHp domain of
PhoR, which revealed an asymmetric dimer of helical hairpins, suggesting
the flexibility of the DHp domain that plays an important role in
the signaling process of this TCS.

Results
PhoP and PhoR
as an Obligate Cognate TCS Pair
To elucidate
the role of PhoR in Mtb virulence, we constructed
a phoR mutant ST163 (Figure 1a). Phenotypic comparisons were made to the
H37Rv parental strain and the previously described phoP mutant ST100.7 Among the genes regulated
by PhoP, a subset is involved in the synthesis of key cell wall components.3 A phoP mutant, therefore, has
a compromised cell wall, resulting in its loss of acid fastness and
sensitivity to the cell wall biosynthesis inhibitor vancomycin.7 Using the disk diffusion assay, we showed that
the phoR and phoP mutants were similarly
sensitive to vancomycin (Figure 1b), suggesting similar defects in the cell wall of
both mutants. Wild-type-level resistance to vancomycin is restored
in the complemented strain ST168.

Figure 1 phoR mutant of Mtb H37Rv has
the same phenotypes as the phoP mutant. (a) Schematic
illustration of the phoR mutant design. DNA sequence
(∼50 bp) encompassing His259 codon in the phoR gene was replaced by a DNA fragment containing a hygromycin-resistant
gene. (b) Sensitivity of the phoP and phoR mutants to vancomycin. Disk diffusion assays were performed to compare
the sensitivities of H37Rv, the phoP mutant (ST100),7 the phoR mutant (ST163), and
the phoR-complemented strain (ST168) to vancomycin
(800 ng/μL). Bars indicate the average zones of inhibition in
millimeters from three independent experiments, and error bars indicate
standard deviations. (c) Growth of Mtb strains in
the mouse lung comparing strains of the wild-type H37Rv (solid line
with diamonds), phoP mutant ST100 (solid line with
squares), and phoR mutant ST163 (dashed line with
triangles). (d) Growth of Mtb strains in the mouse
lung comparing strains of the wild-type H37Rv (solid line with diamonds), phoR mutant ST163 (dashed line with triangles), and phoR mutant complemented with phoPR (ST184)
(solid line with circles). For panels (c,d), each data point is the
average of three experiments, and the error bar is the standard deviation.

To determine whether PhoR is important
for virulence, as is PhoP,
we infected C57BL/6 mice with the wild-type H37Rv, phoP mutant, phoR mutant, and phoR-complemented
strains. The phoR and phoP mutants
were similarly defective (∼2 log cfu below wild type) in the
mouse lung (Figure 1c), and the ability to grow in the mouse lung was enhanced in the
complemented strain, ST184, although not to wild-type levels (Figure 1d).

Our above
data indicated that disruption of either phoP or phoR gave similar phenotypes in Mtb H37Rv,
suggesting that PhoP and PhoR are an obligate TCS pair. Our
data also showed that PhoR is as important as PhoP for Mtb virulence in mice and thus could serve as an antitubercular target.

Overall Structure of the PhoR DHp Domain
The PhoR DHp
domain (designated as PhoRD) used in the structural study consisted
of residues 240–310 of PhoR encoded in the Mtb genome.12 The polypeptide used in crystallization
also included three extra residues GHM (single-letter codes for amino
acids) from the fusion vector at the N-terminus and a mutation of
Arg309 to Lys (to generate a HindIII site) to facilitate
cloning. The purified protein has a size of a dimer in solution by
gel filtration (Figure 2). We determined two structures, native and selenomethionine (SeMet)-labeled
structures (Table 1). Both structures are essentially identical. The crystal structure
contained two polypeptide chains in the asymmetric unit (designated
as A and B). Each chain consists of two helices that formed a helical
hairpin. Helix α2 is shorter than α1, with its C-terminal
end reached to about one-third of α1 (Figure 3). The two polypeptides form a dimeric four-helical
bundle. The N-terminal parts of α1 of the two subunits form
a two-helix coiled coil. All residues, including those from the fusion
vector, were modeled in the final refined structure. The extra residues
from the cloning vector at the N-terminus extended the helix α1.
The side chains of His259, the phosphorylation site, are solvent-exposed.

Figure 2 PhoRD
protein is a dimer in solution. The protein was loaded on
a Superdex 75 column (GE Life Sciences, 10/300/GL) and eluted at 0.7
mL/min with a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
and 1 mM EDTA. The column was calibrated with standards with molecular
weights of 158 000, 44 000, 17 000, and 1350
Da (gel filtration standard, Bio-Rad), as shown in a straight line
with square symbols. The molecular weight of a PhoRD dimer is 16 689
Da, based on its amino acid sequence.

are views approximately 180° rotation from each other along a
vertical axis. The two subunits are designated as A and B. Subunit
A is in the front in (a), whereas it is in the back in (b). Each subunit
is colored rainbow with N-terminus in blue and C-terminus in red.
The phosphorylation site His259 is shown as sticks. The position of
Pro264 is marked with a magenta sphere. Pro264 produces a kink in
helix α1 below His259. This kink is more prominent in subunit
A than in subunit B, making the dimer asymmetric.

b Rwork was calculated
on the reflections used in the refinement; Rfree was calculated on a set of approximately
5% randomly chosen reflections that were never used for the refinement.

The crystals were obtained
from crystallization drops containing
PEG 200 as a precipitant, and several linear molecules, such as ethylene
glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol, 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethanol,
and tetraethylene glycol, that fit with the electron density map were
modeled (Table 1).
These molecules could be impurities in PEG 200 or ordered fragments
of longer polymers. One tetraethylene glycol molecule encircled a
cation, which was bound near the carboxyl terminus of subunit A (Figure S1). The cation was modeled as a potassium
ion (K+) because K+ was present in the crystallization
buffer. The electron density fit well with a K+ ion with
a B factor similar to the surrounding atoms. In a similar fashion
as the tetraethylene glycol encircling the K+, a triethylene
glycol surrounded the ammonium group of Lys309 of subunit A in a semicircle
(Figure S1). The PEG fragments were bound
at the crystal packing interfaces and therefore are unlikely to be
physiologically relevant.

The structure determined from the
native data set is essentially
identical to that from the SeMet-derived crystal, except that the
methionine residues have sulfur atoms in the place of the selenium
atoms. Both structures had similar B factor profiles (Figure S2), reflecting the same crystal packing
effect on the mobility of residues. The two structures were superimposable
with an rmsd of main-chain atoms of 0.19 Å for all 148 residues
in the dimer.

Differences between the Two PhoRD Subunits
in the Dimer
In contrast to the identical dimer structures
between the native
and the SeMet crystals, the two subunits of each dimer were significantly
different, forming an asymmetric dimer. Alignment of subunits A and
B for all 74 residues gave an rmsd of main-chain atoms of 2.13 Å.
Most differences were in helix α1, where the Pro264 residue,
at one turn below His259, induced a kink that gave a different bending
angle of the helix between the two subunits (Figure 3). The bending angle of α1 in subunit
A is ∼28°, whereas that in subunit B is ∼5°.
The two α2 helices were superimposable with an rmsd of 0.78
Å for main-chain atoms from residues 283–310 (see the
amino acid sequence in Figure 4). Excluding the C-terminal three residues, which in subunit
B had high B factors (Figure S2) and weak
side-chain electron density, the rmsd of main-chain atoms of residues
284–307 was 0.41 Å (Figure 5c). The two halves of α1 each superimposed well
between the two subunits when separately aligned, with an rmsd of
0.24 Å for the N-terminal half (residues Gly237 to His259, Figure 4) and an rmsd of
0.43 Å for the second half (residues Pro264 to Arg276) (Figure 5ab). The Pro264 residue
introduces flexibility and allows the helix to bend. Alignment based
on the second half of α1 allows most of α2 to be superimposable
(Figure 5b) because
this half of the structure contributes most of the intrasubunit interactions
between α1 and α2. The difference between the two subunits
results from the variation in the α1 bending angle.

Figure 4 Sequence alignment
of the DHp domains with known structures. Sequences
were aligned based on the structures of the two helices and the position
of the phosphorylation site histidine (in blue). Residues of the two
helices are highlighted in yellow. The PhoRD sequence is shown on
top with residues involved in intrasubunit interface in red, those
in the dimer hydrophobic core underlined, and those involved in intersubunit
hydrogen bonds or salt bridges in bold type. Residue numbers of PhoRD
are labeled on top. HK853 is a HK of unknown function from Thermotoga maritima,18 EnvZ15 and CpxA19 are from Escherichia coli and sense
osmotic and cellular envelope stress, respectively, DesK is a thermosensor
from Bacillus subtilis,16 and LOV-HK is a light-sensing HK from Brucella abortus.20 DesK
and LOV-HK are in other HK subfamilies and lack some conserved sequence
architectures, including the absence of the conserved proline downstream
of the phosphorylation site histidine.

Figure 5 Structural alignments of the two subunits of the PhoRD dimer show
that most of the differences resulted from the variation in the bending
angle of helix α1. The alignments were based on (a) the N-terminal
half of α1, (b) the second half of α1, and (c) helix α2.
Subunit A is in green and subunit B in magenta. His259 side chain
is shown in sticks. The position of Pro264 is marked with a sphere.
In panel (a), the N and C termini are labeled. The C-terminus is where
the CA domain is attached. Potential PhoP-binding site is marked in
yellow.

Intrasubunit Interactions
between the Two Helices of the Helical
Hairpin
Interactions between α1 and α2 of a single
subunit are hydrophobic. The sequence of PhoRD has a pattern of hydrophobic
residues at every third or fourth positions (Figure 4). These hydrophobic side chains gather at
the interface of the two helices to form a continuous hydrophobic
core. Side chains participating in the interhelical hydrophobic interactions
include Phe253, Ala257, Leu261, Pro264, Ile268, Phe271, and Tyr275
of α1 and Val283, Leu286, Ile290, Ala294, Met197, Leu300, Val301,
Leu304, and Leu307 of α2 (Figure 4). The less-bent α1 in subunit B allows additional
side chains of Met250 and Ala308 to be involved in the interhelical
interactions, whereas the different linker conformation allows Leu274
side chain in subunit A to be a part of the interface. The hydrophobic
part of the Arg289 side chain is also involved in the interhelical
hydrophobic interactions. Most of the hydrophobic side chains of the
intrasubunit interface are also involved in the dimer interface.

Dimer Interface Interactions
The interface between
the two helical hairpins of the dimer covers ∼1600 Å2 surface area of each subunit, and the interface interactions
include hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, and salt bridges
(Table S1). The core of the interface is
composed of hydrophobic side chains that hold the coiled coils together.
Hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are on the periphery of this hydrophobic
core. At the N-terminus above the junction of the four-helical bundle,
the two α1 helices have intimate associations owing to the short
side chain of Ala240 and Ala243 at the interface (Figure 4). The side chain of Met239,
a residue from the expression vector, is also involved in this patch
of hydrophobic dimer interface. At the junction, there are two hydrogen
bonds between the side chains of Glu247 of one subunit and Ser246
of the other. These polar and charged interactions are likely to play
a lesser role in the stability of the dimer, compared with the extensive
hydrophobic core of the dimer.

At the four-helical bundle of
the dimer, the interface is strongly hydrophobic and involves side
chains of Met250, Ile254, Leu261, Leu265, Ile268, Ala272, Val283,
Leu286, Leu287, Ile290, Ala294, Met297, Val301, Leu304, and Ala308
of both subunits, as well as additional side chains of Ala257 and
Tyr275 of subunit A (Figure 4). Most of these side chains participate in the intrasubunit
helical–helical interactions as described above. In addition
to these hydrophobic interactions, there are hydrogen bonds and salt
bridges between the two subunits. Arg276 of one subunit and Glu291
of the other, and likewise, Arg262 of one and Asp302 of the other,
have charge–charge interactions and hydrogen bonds between
side chains. The Arg276 side chain of subunit B has a hydrogen bond
to the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of Gly284 of A. The Arg251 side
chain of one subunit gives a hydrogen bond to the carbonyl oxygen
atoms of Ala308 and Leu310 of the other. These strong interface interactions
keep the four-helical bundle together to form a stable dimer structure.

Phosphorylation Site
The flexibility of the DHp domain
changes the position of the phosphorylation site His259 relative to
the rest of the structure but does not vary its nearby environment.
The His259 side chain is surrounded by side chains of Thr255, Asp256,
Glu260, Arg262, and Thr263 of the same subunit and those of Leu305
and Asp302 of the other subunit (Figure 6). Other than the potential hydrophobic interactions
with Leu305, the His259 side chain does not have direct contacts with
other side chains. Glu260 to Thr263 are well-conserved among the majority
of HKs (Figure 4).
An acidic side chain at the equivalent position of Glu260 is implicated
to be a general base in the phosphotransfer reactions in CpxA and
HK853.19,21

Figure 6 Phosphorylation site His259 and its nearby environment
are similar
in both subunits of the PhoRD dimer. To compare the two subunits around
the His259 side chain, two dimers were superimposed by aligning the
N-terminal half of α1 of subunit A from one dimer (colored in
green for subunit A and cyan for subunit B) with that of subunit B
from the other (shown in gray). The superposition is identical to
that in Figure 4a.
Side chains of His259 and its surrounding residues are shown in sticks.

Linker Topology of the
Helical Hairpin
To deduce the
likely mechanism of PhoR autophosphorylation, we compared its DHp
structure with other representative structures with known autophosphorylation
directionality (Figure 7). The topology of the β-hairpin loop in PhoRD is identical
to that of HK85322 but is different from
that of CpxA. CpxA has a right-handed helical bundle connectivity
and autophosphorylates in trans,19 whereas
HK853 has a left-handed connectivity and autophosphorylates in cis.
Therefore, PhoR is likely to autophosphorylate in cis.

Figure 7 Comparison of the structure
of the DHp domain of PhoR with those
of HK853 (PDB id 2C2A) and CpxA (4BIX). The side chains of the phosphorylation site histidine are shown
in sticks. The two α1 helices of each structure are in equivalent
positions relative to each other. Subunits with the equivalent α1
helix are labeled and colored identically, subunit A in green and
B in blue.

Discussion
We
showed that the Mtb phoR mutant strain had
phenotypes similar to the phoP mutant, indicating
that disruption of either phoP or phoR affects the same biochemical pathway, thereby confirming that PhoP
and PhoR work together in regulating the virulence of the pathogen.
Our crystal structure of the DHp domain of PhoR revealed that in spite
of the strong continuous hydrophobic core that holds the dimeric four-helical
bundle together, the structure is flexible by varying the bending
angle of helix α1. Also, the formation of an asymmetric dimer
is likely to play a role in the signal transmission mechanism as suggested
by studies of other HKs,19 and the helical
connectivity topology predicts a cis-autophosphorylation mechanism.

Autophosphorylation of the HK dimer can go through one of the two
possible mechanisms: trans, in which the CA domain of one subunit
binds ATP and transfers the phosphoryl group to the DHp domain of
another subunit; or cis, in which the CA and DHp domains involved
in phosphotransfer belong to the same subunit of the dimer. Structural
and biochemical data on HKs so far suggest that the directionality
of autophosphorylation is determined by the topology of the DHp four-helical
bundle.21,23 All known structures with a left-handed
helical connectivity, for example, HK853, autophosphorylate in cis,
and those with right-handed connectivity, for example, EnvZ24 and CpxA,19 autophosphorylate
in trans. Although the linker between CA and DHp is flexible, it does
not appear to affect the autophosphorylation directionality, likely
because the length of the linker limits its reach and ability to have
the specific interactions necessary for the autokinase reaction to
only one of the phosphorylation sites. The left-handed helical connectivity
of PhoRD suggests that PhoR is likely to autophosphorylate in cis.

The flexibility of the HK dimer is necessary to transmit the signals
received by the sensor domain through conformational changes of the
helical structures of transmembrane and intracellular domains to regulate
the kinase activity. The proline residue that introduced a kink in
helix α1 is highly conserved in HKs (Figure 4). Crystal structures of HKs that do not
have this proline residue, such as DesK16 and LOV-HK,20 also show a kinked helix
at the similar location. The crystal structures of CpxA19 and VicK25 also show
significant asymmetry of the DHp domain, suggesting that the asymmetric
conformation is the mechanism of regulation of the HK activities.
Although there is no reported asymmetric HAMP domain structure, HAMP
domains can vary their structure through helical rotation26 or a shift in register of coiled coils.27 Such structural changes in the HAMP domain can
induce changes in the conformation of the DHp domain, including the
dynamics of symmetry–asymmetry conversion.28 Our structural data of PhoR DHp alone are insufficient
to conclude what role an asymmetric DHp dimer play in the signaling
mechanism. However, the asymmetric dimer observed indicates the flexibility
of α1, which has its mechanistic consequence. The phosphorylation
site His259 is next to the bending pivot of α1 (Figure 5), where Pro264 disrupts the
main-chain hydrogen bonds of the helix. Variation in the α1
bending angle in PhoR DHp changes the relative position between His259
and the C-terminal end of the DHp domain where the CA domain is attached
(Figure 5a) and consequently
modulates the interactions between the phosphorylation site and the
CA domain, affecting the autokinase activity. Similarly, the α1
bending angle changes the relative position of the His259 side chain
and the lower half of α1 (Figure 5a). The lower half of α1 is proposed to harbor
the binding site for the cognate RR.17,29 Therefore,
variation in the α1 bending angle will likely regulate the phosphotransfer
and phosphatase activities. Phosphorylation of His259 will favor its
interaction with the side chain of Arg262 (Figure 6) and thus bring the Arg262 side chain closer,
thereby increasing the helix bending angle. Likewise, a bent α1
will be likely to facilitate phosphorylation of His259.

The
PhoRD structure reported here enables further exploration of
the PhoR signaling mechanism. The structure can guide mutagenesis
studies to identify residues that are involved in binding the CA domain
and those for binding PhoP. By selecting proper sites for labeling
with fluorophores, one can design a FRET-based high-throughput system
to screen for inhibitors to PhoR–PhoP binding interactions.
Such inhibitors will disrupt the signaling pathway of this TCS and
therefore attenuate the virulence of the bacilli.

Materials and
Methods
Construction of phoR Mutant and Complemented
Strains
To disrupt the phoR gene in the Mtb strain H37Rv, we deleted a region of the phoR gene surrounding the codon of the conserved phosphorylation-site
histidine (His259) and inserted in its place a hygromycin-resistance
cassette, a DNA fragment containing a hygromycin-resistant gene to
disrupt the phoR gene, using a method similar to
that for the construction of the phoP mutant ST100.7 The phoR mutant was designated
as ST163. Two strategies were used for the complementation of the phoR mutant. For the in vitro assays, the wild-type phoR gene was introduced in trans via a multicopy mycobacterial
expression plasmid, pMV261,30 under the control
of the constitutive hsp promoter. This complemented
strain was designated as ST168. Owing to concerns regarding the use
of a multicopy plasmid in an in vivo context, a different approach
was utilized for complementation in the mouse infection assay. In
this case, the entire phoPR operon under its native
promoter was introduced by means of an integrative plasmid, pMV306.kan,7 for insertion into the chromosomal attB site.31,32 This complemented strain is designated as
ST184.

Mouse Infection Assays
Mice were infected by the aerosol
method, as previously described.33Mtb strains were inoculated in liquid 7H9 medium and grown
until the mid-log stage of growth. Female-specific pathogen-free C57BL/6
mice (6–8 week old) were infected with Mtb H37Rv, the phoP mutant ST100, the phoR mutant ST163, and the phoPR-complemented phoR mutant ST184, by the aerosol route with 10 mL of suspensions
of the bacteria (1 × 105 per mL) using a nebulizer.
At certain time points over a 12 week period, mice were sacrificed
in triplicate and the whole organ homogenates were inoculated onto
7H10 solid media, using appropriate serial dilutions. After 3 weeks
at 37 °C, colony counts were performed.

Growth Inhibition by Disk
Zone Diffusion Assay
The
ability of vancomycin to inhibit the growth of Mtb strains was assayed by the filter disk assay technique, as previously
described.34 The disk assays used 6.5 mm
paper disks (Scheicher and Schuell), and 10 μL of vancomycin
at 800 μg/mL was spotted onto the disk. The assays were performed
in triplicate.

Protein Expression and Purification
The PhoR dimerization
domain was expressed as a fusion protein with glutathione-S-transferase (GST). To construct the plasmid expressing
the fusion protein, the gst gene was PCR-amplified
using the pGEX-5X-1 plasmid (GE Healthcare) as a template and primers
gst_f, GCTGATTAATATGTCCCCTATACTAGGTTATTGG,
and gst_r, GCTACATATGACCTTGGAAATAAAGATTTTCGCCACGACCTCGATCAGATCC.
The primer gst_r also contains a sequence encoding the TEV protease
cleavage site. The PCR fragment was inserted into the NdeI site of the pET28a plasmid (Novagen) to generate pGST. The correct
orientation of the insert was selected by restriction digestion with KpnI and HindIII, and the DNA sequence
was confirmed by sequencing. The DNA sequence encoding the PhoR DHp
domain (PhoRD, residues 240–310 of the PhoR protein encoded
in the Mtb genome) was PCR-amplified from the Mtb genomic DNA using the primers phoRD_f, CGGACATATGGCCGAAAAGGCCCGGGATTCAGAGG,
and phoRD_r, GCATCAAGCTTGGCAAGCAGCAGCAAATCGTCCACC. The phoRD sequence was inserted into pGST between NdeI and HindIII. The resulting plasmid, pGST–phoRD, produced
a fusion protein with the PhoRD polypeptide fused to the C-terminus
of GST through a linker that is cleavable by TEV protease.

The
plasmid pGST–phoRD was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells. The cells were grown at 37 °C in
Luria–Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with 50 μg/mL
kanamycin, and protein expression was induced by isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (50 μM final concentration)
either at 18 °C overnight or at 37 °C for 2 h. Expression
at 18 °C yielded a small amount of soluble PhoRD protein. At
37 °C, the majority of PhoRD was in insoluble inclusion bodies.
The inclusion bodies were solubilized in 8 M urea, 20 mM phosphate,
pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl, and the protein was refolded by dialysis
in 1 M urea, 20 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, and 150 mM NaCl. The protein
was then passed through a HisTrap column, cleaved by TEV protease
to remove the His-tagged GST, and then passed through the HisTrap
column again, following a similar procedure detailed previously.35 The PhoRD protein thus purified was then passed
through a Superdex 75 column (GE Healthcare). Both 18 and 37 °C
expression yielded the identical protein from Ni-affinity and size-exclusion
chromatography. However, refolding from the inclusion body had a yield
that was >10-fold higher. Therefore, the refolded protein was used
for protein crystallization.

SeMet-Labeled Protein Preparation
To obtain SeMet-labeled
PhoRD (SeMet–PhoRD), M9 minimal media containing 50 μg/mL
kanamycin was used in place of LB. A mixture of amino acids including
lysine (100 mg), phenylalanine (100 mg), threonine (100 mg), isoleucine
(50 mg), leucine (50 mg), valine (50 mg), and SeMet (60 mg) were added
directly to each liter of culture at 15 min prior to induction.36 Cells were induced for protein expression with
50 μM IPTG for 3 h at 37 °C. Subsequent purification of
SeMet–PhoRD was identical to that described above for the native
protein.

Protein Crystallization
For crystallization, the protein
was buffer-exchanged into 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM
EDTA by gel filtration, and it was concentrated to ∼6 mg/mL.
Crystallization experiments were set up by mixing an equal volume
of the protein with the precipitant. Both microbatch and vapor diffusion
methods were performed. For microbatch crystallization, 1 μL
of protein was mixed with 1 μL of crystallization solution,
and the drops were covered with a 50/50 mixture of paraffin and silicon
oil (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, California). For vapor diffusion
experiments, 2 μL of protein was mixed with 2 μL of crystallization
solution, and the drops were equilibrated against 0.5 mL of the crystallization
solution in the reservoir. The crystallization plates were incubated
at 20 °C. The native crystals were obtained from hanging-drop
vapor diffusion, with the crystallization solution containing 0.1
M Na/K phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mM EDTA, 0.2 M NaCl, and 35% PEG 200.
The SeMet-labeled crystals were obtained by microbatch, with the crystallization
solution containing 0.1 M Na/K phosphate, pH 7.2, 0.2 M KI, 2 mM EDTA,
and 35% PEG 200.

X-ray Data Collection and Structural Determination
X-ray data were collected at National Synchrotron Light Source,
Brookhaven
National Laboratory. A set of data were collected on a native crystal
at beamline X6A, and another set of single wavelength anomalous data
were collected at beamline X25 on a SeMet-labeled crystal (Table 1). All crystals were
in the same space group with identical cell parameters. There were
two polypeptide chains per asymmetric unit, with a Matthews volume
of ∼2.28 Å3/Da and a solvent content of 46%.
The data were processed using HKL2000.37

The structure was determined using the single-wavelength anomalous
diffraction phasing method with the SeMet data set. There are four
methionine residues per PhoRD chain. Data output from HKL2000 was
imported into the CCP4 format,38 and phases
and initial maps were calculated with SHELXC/D/E.39 Automatic model building by ArpWarp40 built 140 out of a total of 148 residues in two polypeptide
chains with an R factor of 0.287. The model was manually
adjusted using COOT41 and refined using
REFMAC.42 The native data set was phased
by molecular replacement with Phaser43 and
using the structure determined from the SeMet data set as the search
model. The structural refinement statistics are listed in Table 1.
