Two
high-organic-sulfur Kentucky coals, the eastern Kentucky River
Gem coal and the western Kentucky Davis coal, are examined by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM),
both including elemental analysis by energy-dispersive spectroscopy
(EDS). From the SEM–EDS analysis, it is observed that the western
Kentucky coal had areas with Pb and Cd in addition to the expected
Fe and S and the eastern Kentucky coal had individual Fe–S-rich
areas with La and Ni and with Si, Al, Cr, Ni, and Ti. TEM and selected
area electron diffraction (SAED) analyses demonstrate that anglesite
with a rim of Pb-bearing amorphous Fe-oxide occurs in the western
Kentucky coal. Melanterite, an Fe-sulfate, with minor Al, Si, and
K EDS peaks, suggests that clay minerals may be in close association
with the sulfate, is also detected in the coal. A polycrystalline
metal in the eastern Kentucky sample with a composition similar to
stainless steel is adjacent to an Al-rich shard. Euhedral pyrite grains
surrounded by kaolinite and gibbsite are detected. Overall, it is
noted that element associations should not be assumed to be organic
just because minerals cannot be seen with optical microscopy or with
standard bulk analytical techniques, such as X-ray diffraction (XRD).

1 Introduction
In the consideration of organic sulfur in coal, although sulfur
is, indeed, incorporated into the organic molecules of coal, the measure
of organic sulfur is a convenience in describing coal for marketing
purposes and is not an exact scientific measure.1,2 Basically,
in this sense, “organic sulfur” is merely the sulfur
that cannot be removed by whatever screening and a float–sink
protocol is necessary to describe the coal for the design of a beneficiation
scheme, the marketing of the coal,and so forth. Traditionally, organic
sulfur is defined as the difference between the total sulfur content
and the sum of the pyritic and sulfate sulfur contents, thus subject
to the accumulation of errors in the analysis of those three parameters.
Just as critical as the errors in the defined calculation, very fine
pyrite could be hidden in the <60 mesh (<250 μm) coal
used in the analysis, thus escaping the nitric acid treatment used
in the determination of pyritic sulfur.3 In addition, nonpyrite sulfides, such as sphalerite, can be lost
in the methods specifically directed at pyrite and Fe-sulfate, contributing
to an under-reporting of S in mineral forms. In those cases, the misreported
sulfur in the minerals is, in one sense, “associated with the
organics” rather than actually being in an organic association.
The actual organic sulfur is present as thiophenes, mercaptans, thioethers,
and disulfides.2,4−7

A wide variety of trace
S-bearing minerals have been reported in
coals. For example, Hower et al.8 found
greenockite (CdS) and Ni–Co–Ge and Ag–Cd–Bi
sulfides in lithotypes from a low-ash, low-S eastern Kentucky coal.
They also noted metallic Bi, nisnite (Ni3Sn), a Ag–Cd
mineral, and manganosite (MnO). In a low-S, high-REE lithotype of
the Fire Clay coal, eastern Kentucky, Hower et al.9 reported primary (detrital and/or tuffaceous) and secondary
kaolinite (diagenetic alteration of volcanic glass), La–Ce–Nd–Th
monazite, barium niobate, native gold, and Fe–Ni–Cr
spinels.

So-called superhigh-organic-sulfur coals, more akin
to the two
coals investigated here, also contain a broad mix of micro- and nanoscale
minerals. Among other studies of such coals, Dai et al.10 attributed albite and dawsonite in a superhigh-organic-sulfur
coal from the Yanshan coalfield, Yunnan, China, to submarine exhalations
along with seawater incursions into the anoxic peat swamp. The latter
minerals are associated with enrichments of F, S, V, Cr, Ni, Mo, and
U. Dai et al.11 used X-ray diffraction
(XRD) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to study
the superhigh-organic-sulfur Guiding coal, Guizhou, China, noting
coffinite, brannerite, V-bearing jarosite, Se-bearing pyrite, F- and
Cl-bearing tourmaline, and B-bearing mixed-layer illite/smectite.
Saikia et al.12 used high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) to identify pyrrhotite, marcasite, chalcopyrite,
and submicron As-, Pb-, and Se-bearing pyrites in Assam, India, coals.
Hematite, magnetite, and goethite with adsorbed As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Pb,
and V were also noted in the coals. Liu et al.13 found Cd- and Se-bearing sulfides in the Guiding and Yanshan
coals, China. Zhao et al.14 used scanning
TEM–energy-dispersive spectroscopy (STEM–EDS) and TEM
and associated techniques to identify V- and Cr-bearing illite, muscovite,
pyrophyllite, pyrite, jarosite, and Ti-oxides in coal from the Yanshan
coalfield, Yunnan, China; the Ti-oxides were the most important V-
and Cr-bearing phases.

The coals investigated here were chosen
because of their high-organic-sulfur
content. In both coals, pyritic sulfur was also relatively high. Rather
than emphasizing the obvious occurrences of pyrite, in this study,
we are examining some of the other minerals found in these high-organic-sulfur
coals. The TEM study of the ultrafine structure of coal, still a technique
rarely employed in coal studies, provides a glimpse into the mineral
associations of elements that in some cases, might have been considered
as having an organic association.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Scanning Electron Microscopy
2.1.1 Davis Coal (Sample No. 71205)
Figure 1 shows an image of
framboidal pyrite grains with one brighter mineral labeled as block
18. The EDS spectrum indicates that Pb, Fe, and S all are present
within the area of the EDS scan. A region containing a bright mineral
with a similar chemical array is seen in Figure 2A. In this case, Cd also appears to occur
within the analyzed region. Additional accessory minerals that found
by SEM analysis were zircon (Zr–Si–O) and a Y-phosphate
mineral, possibly xenotime (Figure 2B). Zircon and rare earth (plus Y) phosphates can have
a detrital or tuffaceous origin in coals; the latter particularly
evident in coals such as the Fire Clay in eastern Kentucky where a
volcanic contribution is evident,9 but
not to be discounted in other coals where the volcanic input could
have been diluted in the swamp. Note that the EDS analyses showing
arrays of elements do not necessarily mean that the elements are within
one mineral in the analyzed area.

2.1.2 River Gem Coal (Sample No. 5400)
A variety of Fe-sulfide grains are shown in Figure 3. Area 64 on Figure 3d is the region enlarged in Figure 4a (and further expanded on Figure 4b). The EDS spectrum
of the overgrown framboidal pyrite regions 86 and 71, as shown on Figure 4C,D, clearly shows
the presence of Fe and S and a hint of La and Ni. Region 41, seen
in Figure 5A and expanded
on Figure 6, shows
the presence of Fe and S, with lesser amounts of Si and Al, and minor
amounts of Cr, Ni, Cu, and (perhaps) Ti. Fe-sulfates are shown by Figure 5B which shows a spherical
morphology and an elongated, uneven morphology. Barium and sulfur
were also detected during investigation by SEM.

2.2 Transmission
Electron Microscopy
2.2.1 Davis Coal (Sample No.
71205)
Figure 7 shows a TEM micrograph
of the cross section of the Pb– S mineral identified in Figure 2. The EDS spectrum
(Figure 7E from the
area of circle on Figure 7B) indicates that the mineral is a single crystal of anglesite.
Anglesite, being a Pb sulfate (PbSO4), may be an oxidation
product of a primary Pb mineral, such as galena (PbS). The anglesite
grain shows an alteration rim of poorly crystalline Fe-oxide (Figures 8 and 9). At the boundary with the Fe-oxides, the anglesite grain
shows pits and protrusions. The EDS maps (Figure 9) show that a small concentration of Pb is
also present in the Fe-oxide region. High-resolution and electron
diffraction patterns from the Fe-oxide region show mostly amorphous
material with a few nanocrystals scattered in the region. However,
it is possible that focused ion beam (FIB) milling damaged the crystal
structure of the Fe-oxides. The apparent gradients in S and Pb seen
in the individual element plots and in the composite element maps
of Figure 8 are a function
of the thickness variations introduced in the sample milling (compare
to the bright-field image in upper left of Figure 8).

(C,D) SAED at 0° and of 18° tilt respectively, correspond
to the [−121] and [−122] zone axes of anglesite. The
selected area is shown in (B). The EDS spectrum is from the same circle
as the SAED.

grain shown on Figure 7B. The Fe-rich rim in the top third of the
image is an Fe–Pb oxide. The gradients in Pb and S are a function
of the difference in thickness of the specimen because of sample preparation.

an Fe-oxide, as was seen on Figure 8. (B) TEM image of the same grain. Note that the image

Figure 10 shows
a region of Fe sulfate minerals with minor Al, Si, and K peaks, the
latter possibly from clay minerals. Electron diffraction from the
Fe-sulfate shows spots attenuated by a diffuse reflection from amorphous
regions. The d-spacings of the spots are consistent
with melanterite crystal planes (pdf 04-010-6331), an Fe-sulfate that
is also identified in the XRD pattern of the sample.

2.2.2 River Gem Coal (Sample No. 5400)
Figure 11 shows the
areas of interest in the liftout of sample 5400. The bladed region
shown in the center of Figures 12 and 13 is dominated by Fe,
Cr, Ni, and Cu, similar to the composition of stainless steel (the
dark region to the lower right of the images is the Pt protective
layer placed during liftout). The metal is polycrystalline, as indicated
by its diffraction pattern that shows rings of spots (Figure 13). As native metals are not
common in coal, the origin of this material is a problem. Possible
points of contamination would seem to be (1) in the initial sampling,
(2) in the initial preparation of the particulate sample, (3) in the
preparation of the epoxy-bound sample prior to the SEM examination,
(4) in the FIB milling and liftout, or (5) in the preparation for
the TEM examination. Although sampling at the mine with a steel-tipped
miner’s pick would seem to offer a logical point of entry for
the grain (point 1), we note that Figure 6 shows that the mineral was surrounded by
coal until grinding and polishing exposed it, also eliminating point
2 and, most likely, point 3 from consideration. Points 4 and 5 can
be excluded because Fe, Cr, Ni, and Cu were detected during the investigation
by SEM, prior to TEM sample preparation. Minerals consistent with
the chemistry and crystal structure detected include chromferide (pdf
00-041-1466; pdf numbers reference the American Mineralogist Crystal
Structure Database at http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/AMS/amcsd.php) (Fe3Cr1–x (x = 0.6)) which has been found in quartz veins cutting amphibolites
in the South Urals,15 ferrite/native iron
(pdf 00-006-0696), and kamacite (pdf 00-037-0474) (Fe9Ni).
Similar minerals, but with poorer matches, include awaruite (pdf 00-038-0419)
(FeNi3) and taenite (pdf 00-018-0877) (Fe5Ni).
Therefore, along with the Al-rich shard (Figure 13) adjacent to the latter grain (possibly,
but not definitively, a remnant of the alumina used in polishing),
we are left with no consensus for the genesis of some of the particles
in the sample.

show the TEM bright field micrograph of the shard and the corresponding
electron diffraction pattern. The white circle selection marks the
area selected for the diffraction pattern.

The euhedral pyrite grains seen on Figure 14 show only Fe and S in their chemical composition.
The pyrite grains are surrounded by aluminum-silicate flakes that
have the composition of kaolinite and by Al-oxide phases, possibly
gibbsite.

Figures 15 and 16 show another
pyrite grain embedded in a matrix
of flaky particles, most likely clays. The composition of the clay
particles surrounding the pyrite varies in terms of Al content, with
a few Al-rich grains, likely kaolinite, and some grains that are almost
exclusively composed of Si oxide.

3 Summary
Two coals,
one from western Kentucky and one from eastern Kentucky,
both with high-organic-sulfur content, were examined by scanning and
TEM methods. With the caveat that the minerals are fine and the volume
examined by SEM–EDS may include multiple minerals, the western
Kentucky coal had areas with Pb and Cd in addition to the expected
Fe and S. The eastern Kentucky coal had individual Fe–S-rich
areas with La and Ni and with Si, Al, Cr, Ni, and Ti.

TEM and
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis of the
western Kentucky coal demonstrate that the Pb-rich mineral is anglesite
with a rim of Pb-bearing amorphous Fe-oxide. Melanterite, an Fe-sulfate,
with minor Al, Si, and K EDS peaks which is possibly indicating included
clays, was also detected in the coal.

A polycrystalline metal
in the eastern Kentucky sample with a composition
similar to stainless steel is adjacent to an Al-rich shard. Seemingly
logical vectors for contamination were deemed not likely given the
methods of preparation. Euhedral pyrite grains surrounded by kaolinite
and gibbsite were detected.

Overall, studies such as this, including
our previous TEM investigations8,9 and the work by Saikia
et al.12 and Zhao
et al.,14 illustrate the information to
be gained through the fine-scale examination of coal structures. Elemental
occurrences passed off as being in an organic association are seen
to be truly associated with minerals. Certainly, this is not always
the case, but it does point to the necessity for coal scientists to
not dismiss element associations not obviously inorganic at micron
or larger scales as being of a “default” organic association.

4 Methods
Two high-organic-sulfur coal samples were analyzed,
a high volatile
C bituminous Western Kentucky no. 6 (Davis) coal from a borehole in
the Wilson ’ quadrangle,
Henderson County, Kentucky,
and a high volatile A bituminous River Gem coal from the Holly Hill ’ quadrangle,
Whitley County, Kentucky.
The Davis coal, sample 71205, was included in a rank study of western
Kentucky.16 The River Gem coal, sample
5400, was subject to petrographic, geochemical, and palynologic investigations.17,18 The Davis and River Gem chemical analyses are shown in Table 1. We note that these
are whole sample analyses and are not necessarily representative of
the TEM specimens studied (preparation procedures described below).

Powder XRD was run on the two samples with a Rigaku
Miniflex benchtop
diffractometer, using Cu Kα radiation. The patterns were recorded
from 3° to 65°2θ, at step sizes of 0.02°2θ
and 3 s/step count time. See the Supporting Information files for XRD data.

Particulate samples of the coals were
mounted in a Spurr epoxy
resin, as modified by Ellis,19 and polished
with a 0.05 μm alumina powder prior to electron microscopy analyses.
For SEM (FEI Quanta 600, operated at 20 keV), samples were lightly
coated with carbon to prevent charging and then observed in the backscatter
(BSE) mode to find particles with high average atomic numbers. EDS
analyses were conducted on particles with high BSE contrast.

For each sample, on the basis of the SEM–EDS analyses, an
area was selected for FIB extraction and subsequent TEM analysis.
A FEI Helios 600 NanoLab FIB was used to extract and liftout a thin
slice of the promising mineral assemblage tentatively identified by
SEM. The slices were mounted on TEM holders and ion-milled to approximately
100 nm thickness. A Cu grid was used for sample 71205, but a Mo grid
was chosen for sample 5400 to avoid interference with copper detected
in the sample by SEM. TEM analysis was conducted on a JEOL JEM-2100
analytical electron microscope equipped with a lanthanum hexaboride
emitter operated at 200 keV and equipped with a JEOL 60 mm2-window silicon drift detector-based EDS system for chemical mapping.
SAED was employed for mineralogical identification of grains. In conjunction
with SAED and for grains too small for SAED, HRTEM was used for mineral
identification. Lattice spacing in HRTEM micrographs was measured
from the corresponding Fast Fourier Transform, computed in the Gatan
Digital Micrograph image analysis software.
