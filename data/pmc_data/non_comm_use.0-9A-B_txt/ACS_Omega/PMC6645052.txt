The magnetoconductance (MC) effect
was investigated for two types
of organic solar cells with single junction (SJ) and bulk junction
(BJ) of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) as donor (D) and [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor (A). Three
components with different half-field-at-half-maximums (B1/2) of 4 ± 1, 20 ± 15 and >400 mT, hereafter
referred to MCS,M,B in a sequence, were observed in the
magnetic field dependence of the MC effects measured under dark and
light conditions. The magnitude of the MCS,M,B components
is sensitive to not only the junction structure of the cell but also
the presence or absence of incident light. The bias voltage (V) dependence of the MC effect in the dark for the SJ-cell
is maximized around the turn-on voltage (VON) of the dark current, where a flat band condition of the active
layer is achieved. The B1/2 for the MCM component of the SJ-cell increases with V beyond VON. In light, the BJ-cell exhibits
the MC effect, whereas no effect is detected for the SJ-cell. The
MCS,M components for the BJ-cell in light increase with
the incident light power. The transient MCS,M components
for the BJ-cell measured using a nanosecond pulse laser increases
with the delay time after the flash. By integrating these phenomena
and the phase of the MC effect, it is concluded that all of the MC
components arise from the magnetic field effect on the spin conversion
of nongeminate electron (e)–hole (h) pairs with spin-dependent
charge recombinations at the D/A-interface. The B1/2 values for MCS,M,B are, respectively, understood
by the spin conversion due to the hyperfine interaction, the spin
relaxation, and the g-factor difference for e (PCBM–) and h (P3HT+). Kinetic simulations of
the MCS,M components for the BJ-cell observed at the short-circuit
condition in light yield an efficiency of ca. 40% for the nongeminate
recombination, which is accompanied by the generation of triplet excitons
as well as relaxation to a ground singlet state. The loss mechanism
of moderate triplet recombination suggests an important possibility
to improve the power conversion efficiency by harvesting of the triplet
excitons.

1 Introduction
Organic
solar cells have many advantages because of being lightweight
and form-flexible, as well as their low cost for fabrication.1 Therefore, organic solar cells have attracted
attention as next-generation solar cells and as the alternative to
conventional silicon-based solar cells.2 However, compared with inorganic solar cells, the power conversion
efficiency (η) of organic solar cells is not yet sufficiently
high3 because of some loss mechanisms caused
by intrinsic properties of the organic molecules, such as lower ability
for absorption of solar spectrum in the near infrared region, short
exciton diffusion distances, large binding energies between electrons
(e) and holes (h), and slow drift mobility.4 The dissociation of excitons, and the generation and recombination
of charged carriers occur in the range of the interface between the
electron-donor (D) and acceptor (A) in the active layer of a cell;
therefore, some of the loss mechanisms are heavily dependent on the
combination and junction architecture of the D and A.4b,5 The electron spin in a molecule also plays an essential role in
the exciton and carrier dynamics at the D/A-junction. For instance,
mutual orientation of the spin angular momenta for two electrons in
singly occupied molecular orbitals of the exciton significantly changes
the exciton energy, which determines the ability of the electron transfer
at the D/A-junction. The spin configuration of an e–h pair
in the D/A-junction area affects the recombination efficiency because
the e–h pair is a precursor in spin conservative recombination.
Recombination at the D/A-junction is one of the main loss mechanisms
that suppress the device performance. Therefore, an understanding
of the recombination mechanism is critical for the development of
organic solar cells with high η.

Magnetoconductance (MC)
in organic semiconductor, which is defined
by a change of current density (J) induced by an
external magnetic field (B): MC (%) = [J(B) – J(0)]/J(0) × 100, arises from the interplay between spin-dependent
recombination and the magnetic field-dependent spin conversion of
spin pairs. The MC effect can thus provide information regarding the
carrier dynamics in organic solar cells under operating conditions
without destruction of the device. The MC effect due to the hyperfine
mechanism of e–h pairs in a single junction (SJ) solar cell
with a simple D/A-junction of pentacene and C60 layers
in the center of device has recently clarified a geminate recombination
yield of 1%.6 In a bulk junction (BJ) solar
cell that possess random orientation of the D/A-junction due to nanoscaled
interpenetrating phase separation with fibrillary networks of regioregular
poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) crystals as D and domains of [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as A,7 a negative MC effect in dark8 and a positive MC effect in light8,9 because of
the hyperfine mechanism is also observed in the magnetic field region
lower than 20 mT. In addition, broad MC effects are detected due to
the Δg mechanism of e–h pairs, which
are, respectively, negative and positive below and above 1 T in light.9 From the abstruse magnetic field dependence of
the MC effect, it is suggested that an inhomogeneous junction structure
affects the MC effect; however, the relation between the MC effects
and the D/A-junction architecture is not yet well understood. Therefore,
here we comprehensively examine the MC effects in dark and light for
both SJ- and BJ-cells using P3HT and PCBM to elucidate the mechanism
of the MC effect. Here, we show that the observed MC effects arise
from the spin-selective recombination of e–h pairs of which
the spin conversion occurs due to the hyperfine interaction, the spin
relaxation and the difference of g-factor. Kinetic
analysis of the MC effects observed for the BJ-cell estimates a substantial
nongeminate recombination with the generation of triplet excitons
at the short-circuit condition.

2 Results
2.1 Device Performance and Multicomponent MC Effects
Figure 1 shows the
bias voltage (V) dependence of J for the SJ- and BJ-cells. Both cells exhibited rectifying and photovoltaic
effects in dark and light, respectively. The turn-on voltage in dark
(VON) and the open-circuit voltage (VOC) in light were around 0.4 V. The fill-factors
(FF) for both cells were also almost the same, although the short-circuit
current (JSC) for the BJ-cell became much
higher than that of the SJ-cell. The high JSC of the BJ-cell stems from the larger area of the D/A-junction than
that of the SJ-cell, which enhances the efficiency of exciton dissociation
to geminate e–h pairs by electron transfer from P3HT to PCBM.
The η of the BJ-cell was approximately five times as large as
that of the SJ-cell (Table 1), mainly because of the large JSC difference for the SJ- and BJ-cells. It was noted that the BJ-cell
in this work exhibits η less than well-optimized BJ-cells (2–5%).7b,10JSC for the BJ-cell was dependent on
the incident light power (Pin), which
obeyed the power law JSC ∝ Pinα with α = 0.93, while
in the case of the SJ-cell, α was almost unity (0.99). These
results suggest the recombination of nongeminate e–h pairs
in the BJ-cell in light. On the other hand, transient photocurrents
for the SJ- and BJ-cells were observed in the microsecond region,
as represented in Figure S1. In the time
profile of the photocurrent for the SJ-cell, two shoulders were evident
at 7.6 × 10–8 and 5.2 × 10–7 s, which correspond to the transit times (τ) for e in the
PCBM layer and for h in the P3HT layer, respectively. The photocurrent
decay for the BJ-cell is a smooth and downwardly convex curve. Simulations
for the observed decay indicate the presence of both pseudo-first
and second-order recombinations during the carrier transport in the
blend film of P3HT:PCBM.

Figure 2 shows the
typical magnetic field dependence of the MC effects observed for the
SJ- and BJ-cells. The phase of the MC effect for the SJ-cell in dark
is negative, and the magnitude symmetrically increases with |B| in the low magnetic field range within ±50 mT and
gradually decreases with |B| in the magnetic field
range of |B| > 50 mT. The magnitude of the negative
MC effect for the BJ-cell in dark also indicates a symmetric increase
in low magnetic fields but remains level in high magnetic fields.
On the other hand, no reliable MC effect was detected for the SJ-cell
in light. For the BJ-cell in light, the MC effect detected in low
magnetic fields changed the phase to positive and the magnitude decreased
gradually in high magnetic fields. The phases of the MC effects observed
in dark and light were, respectively, interpreted in terms of the
recombination and dissociation currents, as detailed in the Discussion section. To elucidate the individual
components involved in the observed MC effect, they were fitted using
the Lorentzian and Gaussian functions,9,11 assuming that
all of the MC components were saturated at the high magnetic field
limit. The fitting with the following multi-Lorentzian function reproduced
the measured results slightly better than that with the multi-Gaussian
function as described in Section S2 of the Supporting Information. 1  As shown in Figure 2, the fitting results clarified the coexistence
of at most three components with different B1/2 (see Figure S3 for detail).
Here, B1/2 is the field at which the MC
effect reaches half of MC∞, the saturated value
in extremely high fields. Hereafter, the three components, that is,
the sharp (B1/2 = 4 ± 1 mT), middle
(B1/2 = 20 ± 15 mT), and broad (B1/2 > 400 mT) MC components are denoted MCS, MCM, and MCB, respectively, as listed
in Table 2. The MC
effect for the SJ-cell in dark consists of MCS with a negative
phase, MCM with a negative phase, and MCB with
a positive phase, whereas that for the BJ-cell in dark is comprised
of negative MCS and MCM components. The light
MC effect for the BJ-cell possesses a positive MCS, a positive
MCM and a negative MCB. The phase of MC∞ is dependent not only on the D/A-junction architecture
in the active layer of the solar cell but also on the condition of
dark or light.

2.2 Dark
MC Effect
The MC effects for
the SJ- and BJ-cells changed with the variation of V, as shown in Figure S5. The observed
magnetic field dependence of the MC effect could be fitted by the
multi-Lorentzian function. The MC curves for the SJ-cell were analyzed
with the MCS, MCM, and MCB components,
whereas those for the BJ-cell were fitted using only the MCS and MCM components. Fitting of the observed MCB component for the SJ-cell could not provide a unique set of B1/2 and MC∞ because the magnetic
field range measured was not sufficiently wide to detect the saturation
behavior of the MCB component. As shown in Figure 3, B1/2 of the MCS component for the SJ-cell (ca. 4 mT) did not
change significantly with V, whereas the MCM component increased with V. In the BJ-cell, B1/2 of the MCS component was almost
the same as that of the SJ-cell, but one of the MCM components
was approximately 30 mT at low voltages, which is larger than that
of the SJ-cell and slightly increased at high voltages. The differences
of not only the size but also the bias voltage dependence of B1/2 between the MCS and MCM components implies a difference in the mechanism for the spin dynamics
behind the MC effect.

Bias voltage
dependence of B1/2 (c,d) and MC∞ (e,f) of the MCS (red) and MCM (green) components
involved in the dark MC effects for the SJ- and BJ-cells. Data corresponding
to the MCB component (blue) shown in (e) are the values
of the MCB component measured at 300 mT. Dotted lines are
used to show the trend.

The magnitude of MC∞ is significantly dependent
on V. MCB∞ for the SJ-cell
has a large dispersion; therefore, the MC effect due to the MCB component at 300 mT is plotted in Figure 3e, which was extracted from the curve fitting,
to observe the bias voltage variation of the MCB component.
All of the components detected for the SJ-cell have a maximum amplitude
around 0.3 V, which decreases with an increase of V. Comparison with the J–V characteristics indicates that the voltage for the MC peak is in
agreement with VON where the nature of
dark current switches from diffusion to drift. VON of the J–V curve
in dark is very close to the built-in potential estimated from the
transit times that appeared in transient photocurrent for the SJ-cell
(see Section S1). The dependence of MC∞ with a peak
was also observed for the SJ-cell that consisted of pentacene and
fullerene in our previous report,6 and
this is interpreted in terms of the balance between the dissociation
and recombination rate constants (kdis and krec) of nongeminate e–h
pairs formed at the D/A-interface. In the SJ-cell, the increase in
the internal electric field in the D-to-A direction (forward bias)
promotes drift motions of hole and electron toward the D/A-interface,
which results in promotion of recombination and inhibition of dissociation
of the e–h pair; namely, the ratio kdis/krec monotonically decreases. No large
MC effect is expected in the case of extremely small kdis or krec, because the MC
effect is caused by a change between the dissociation and recombination
yields due to the external magnetic field. This is a basic reason
for the peak dependence of MC∞ for the SJ-cell,
as described in detail in the Discussion section.
The flat band condition of the active layer achieved around VON(12) may allow kdis to be comparable with krec. The three MC effects observed for the SJ-cell of
P3HT|PCBM are maximized around VON, which
indicates that all of the components are attributed to the magnetic
field-dependent spin dynamics of the same nongeminate e–h pair.
The MCS and MCM components observed for the
BJ-cell also show a similar bias voltage dependence to that for the
SJ-cell, although their peaks are broad and obscure. The J–V curve for the BJ-cell indicates a gradual
transition from a diffusion current regime with a slope of one to
a drift current regime with a slope larger than one. This broad transition
in the BJ-cell suggests that the flat band condition cannot be uniformly
realized in the entire active layer because of an inhomogeneous D/A-junction
structure. The random orientation of the D/A-junction in the BJ-cell
is probably also the reason for the lack of a clear peak in the voltage
dependence of the MC effects.

2.3 Light
MC Effect
No reliable MC effect
was observed for the SJ-cell at the short-circuit condition under
irradiation with the solar simulator at various light power, whereas
the BJ-cell gave an obvious MC effect that increased in intensity
with the light power as shown in Figure S6. Analysis of the MC effect observed for the BJ-cell using the multi-Lorentzian
function confirmed the presence of all three components. As shown
in Figure 4a, MCS∞ and MCM∞ increase
with the light power, whereas their B1/2 values are maintained almost constant. The observed dependence on
the light power proves that both the MCS and MCB effects in light are caused by a multiphoton process. The MC effect
due to the MCB component at 500 mT also increases with
the light power, suggesting the same multiphoton process.

(green), and MC at 400 mT subtracted from that at 100 mT (blue) plotted
as contributions from the MCS, MCM, and MCB components. Dotted lines are used to show the trend.

The time dependence of the MC
effect obtained from transient photocurrents
detected at the short-circuit condition by excitation with the pulse
laser is depicted in Figure S7. No MC effect
for the SJ-cell was observed, whereas the BJ-cell showed a clear MC
effect that increased in intensity with the delay time (t). The magnetic field dependence of the transient MC effect for the
BJ-cell was simulated by adopting positive MCS, positive
MCM and negative MCB components as with the
light MC effect observed under continuous light (see Figure S3d). Figure 4c,d shows that B1/2 does not change
with t, but the three MC components simultaneously
increase in intensity with t. The apparent increase
rate constant for both components is ca. 6 × 105 s–1, which is almost the same as that for charge recombination
estimated by simulations of the transient photocurrents for the BJ-cell.
Combined with the light power dependence and the time variation of
the light MC effects, it is concluded that the three MC components
arise from the charge recombination of nongeminate e–h pairs.

3 Discussion
3.1 Sharp MC Component
As listed in Table 2, the MCS component with B1/2 of ca. 4 mT due
to nongeminate e–h pairs was detected for the SJ- and BJ-cells
in dark. In light, the MCS component appears only for the
BJ-cell. Although not only nongeminate pairs but also geminate pairs
are generated in light, it is considered that the MC effect due to
the recombination of geminate pairs could be undetectable because
of the high dissociation yield at the interface between P3HT and PCBM.13 In addition, the SJ-cell has a D/A-junction
only at the center of the active layer, which does not form nongeminate
e–h pairs after separation of e and h because of the drift
motion along the internal electric field. This is probably the reason
for the lack of a clear MC effect with the SJ-cell. B1/2 for the MCS component, which is comparable
with the hyperfine coupling constant (ahf) for organic radicals, indicates that coherent spin conversion (ωhf) of nongeminate e–h pairs is driven by the magnetic
interaction between the electron and nuclear spins.11a

The phases of the dark and light MCS components
for the BJ-cell can be qualitatively understood by the magnetic field-dependent
spin conversion among the spin sublevels of the nongeminate e–h
pairs, which has a rate constant of singlet recombination (kS) to the ground singlet state (1gr) that is different from that of triplet recombination (kT) to a triplet exciton (3ex), as
illustrated in Scheme 1.

Scheme 1 Elementary Processes of the Nongeminate e–h Pairs Formed
at
the D/A-Junction
Solid circles reflect populations
of the states. ΔEZ is the Zeeman
splitting equal to gμBB.

The spin conversion between the three triplet
spin sublevels (T)
and the singlet state (S) of the e–h pair efficiently occurs
in the absence of an external magnetic field; however, the Zeeman
interaction prohibits the T+ and T– sublevels
from spin conversion because the energy shift (±ΔEZ) is much larger than the splitting by hyperfine
interaction. Therefore, dissociation of the T± sublevels
takes over recombination via the S state, so that the dissociation
and recombination yields (ϕdis and ϕrec) of the e–h pairs at the D/A-junction increase and decrease,
respectively, under strong magnetic fields. The magnetic field effect
on these yields of nongeminate e–h pairs results in negative
MC in dark and positive MC in light because most of the dark current
is terminated by the recombination of e and h, while the photocurrent
originates from the dissociation of e–h pairs.

In the
case of fast spin conversion and slow spin relaxation, the
MC effect due to the e–h pair mechanism can be calculated using
the equations as described at Section S5 of the Supporting Information. 2   3   4  Here, kdis is
the dissociation rate constant and krec is the total recombination rate constant defined by taking the average
of the recombination rate constants from the individual spin sublevels. Equations 2 and 3 indicate that the dark MC effect is negative and that the
light MC effect is positive. Figure 5a shows a plot of MCdark against the reduced
dissociation rate constant (kdisr) calculated with variation
of the reduced triplet recombination rate constant (kTr), which
reflects the spin-selectivity in recombination (kS/kT). The kdisr of the
SJ-cell is expected to monotonically increase with the bias voltage
because the electrostatic potential for the e–h pair becomes
dissociative with the bias voltage like the Onsager and Poole–Frenkel
models.14 The calculated U-shaped tendency
of MCdark of Figure 5a is the same as the peak behavior observed in the bias voltage
dependence of the dark MC effect for the SJ-cell of Figure 3e, which appears in the flat
band region where dissociation and recombination are sufficiently
competitive. According to eq 2, the MCdark value reaches a maximum 5  at 6  kdisr yields
MCdarkmax in
the range from 0 to 1, which indicates
that the kdisr dependence of MCdark has a peak
except for the case where kTr = 0, which is equivalent to kS:kT = 100:0. The
MCdarkmax value
is dependent on the spin-selectivity and changes from −50 to
0. In both kS:kT = 62:38 and kS:kT = 35:65, the calculated MCdarkmax is almost equal to the total of MCS∞ and MCM∞ (ca. 0.42%).
The light MC effects detected for BJ-cell with P3HT:PCBM are understood
by singlet recombination that is slightly faster than triplet recombination.9 The preferential singlet recombination at room
temperature is also expected on the basis of the energetics of the
e–h pair and the triplet exciton (3ex) of P3HT,15 although triplet recombination at 77 K has been
experimentally clarified by the time-resolved electron spin resonance.15b Therefore, the MC effect observed at room temperature
in the present work should be interpreted in terms of kS > kT rather than kS < kT. Using
the estimated spin-selectivity with kS:kT = 62:38, the dissociation rate dependence
of MClight is calculated as shown in Figure 5b. MClight, which monotonically
increases with kdisr, reaches the same level as the light MCS component for the BJ-cell observed at the shot-circuit condition
with illumination by an AM1.5 G solar simulator (ca. +0.29%). The
point of the calculated MClight curve that crosses the
level of MCS∞ plus MCM∞ observed in light gives kdis/krec = 1.52, from which the recombination probability
can be calculated as ϕrec = 0.40. This value is almost
twice as large as that for the BJ-cell of P3HT:PCBM determined by
light modulation experiments.16 The incident
light power dependence of ϕrec calculated in the
same manner is represented in Figure 6. ϕrec decreases with the incident
light power. Considering that the performance of the BJ-cell in this
paper is not good when compared with well-optimized P3HT:PCBM-cells,7b,10 the estimated recombination loss of 40% under illumination of 1
sun seems to be reasonable. Among the many studies on recombination
in P3HT:PCBM film, clarified by time-of-flight17 and transient photocurrent,18 voltage,19 and absorption20 methods, some of these reports point out that
substantial bimolecular recombination occurs.21 The nongeminate recombination for the BJ-cell in this work is suggested
from correspondence with the power law with α < 1 for the
light power dependence of JSC and is confirmed
by the exponential decay of the transient photocurrent governed almost
by the unimolecular kinetics. The high ϕrec indicates
significant nongeminate recombination in the BJ-cell, which cannot
be the only main loss mechanism but also the generation of 3ex; 3ex is relatively long-lived, although its electronic
energy is lower than that of the singlet exciton (1ex);
therefore, the harvesting of 3ex as with triplet fusion
(23ex → 1ex) could be a solution for
the problems of energy losses.

3.2 Middle and Broad MC Components
As
summarized in Table 2, the observed bias voltage, light power, and time dependences of
the MCM and MCB components, which are similar
to those of the MCS component, indicate that both MCM and MCB originate from the nongeminate e–h
pairs. Compared with the MCS component, B1/2 for the MCM is larger and that for the
MCB is even larger. The phase of MCM is the
same as the MCS while that of MCB is opposite.
The same phase as MCS (hyperfine mechanism) and the B1/2 values of 30 ± 22 mT suggest that the
spin conversion in nongeminate e–h pairs for the MCM component is caused by spin relaxation that is induced by fluctuation
of the local magnetic field (Blo).15,22 The spin relaxation rate (krlx) is written
by23 7  Here, g, μB, and ℏ are the g-factor, Bohr magneton,
and Dirac constant, respectively. The dependence of krlx determines the B1/2 of
MC effect because of the spin relaxation mechanism. τ is the
correlation time that characterizes the fluctuation. The fluctuation
is affected by the drift motion of carriers; therefore, τ should
be shortened under high voltages. This voltage dependence of τ
is consistent with the observed steep increase of B1/2 for the dark MCM component above VON. For example, the krlx for a hole in P3HT increases with the temperature and is
expected to be larger than 107 s–1 because
of the fast hole dynamics at room temperature in the absence of an
internal electric field.24 Therefore, krlx is accelerated above VON and becomes less sensitive to B, which
results in broadening of the MC curve.25 On the other hand, the spin conversion for the anti-phase of MCB with large B1/2 is interpreted
in terms of the Δg mechanism.9,11a,26 The different Larmor precessions
of the individual spins of e and h coherently modulates the spin character
of the e–h pair between the S and T0 states at a
frequency (ωΔg) 8  Here, ge and gh are g-factors for e and h,
respectively. Equation 8 indicates that the spin conversion rate due to the Δg mechanism is typically negligible in the low magnetic
field region. However, the g difference in the combination
of P3HT and PCBM (|Δg| ≈ 2.5 ×
10–3)24a,27 is relatively large;
therefore, ωΔg for the e–h
pair can reach at ca. 108 s–1 at 500
mT, which is almost in the same order as ωhf. However,
the lack of a MCB component detected for the BJ-cell in
dark implies a mechanism other than the g-factor
difference, which could be related with light irradiation, but this
requires further investigation. It is concluded that the nongeminate
e–h pair that yields the MCS effect due to the hyperfine
mechanism could also be the origin for MCB because of the
particularly large |Δg|.

4 Conclusion
SJ- and BJ-cells with standard materials of P3HT
and PCBM were
used to comprehensively measure the MC effects in dark and light.
Multi-Lorentzian fitting of the observed magnetic field dependence
of the MC effects indicated the presence of three components with
different B1/2 values, named as MCS,M,B in ascending order of B1/2. The bias voltage dependence of the dark MC effect and the light
power and time dependences of the light MC effect clarified that all
three components were attributed to nongeminate e–h pairs with
spin-selective recombination. The MCS, MCM,
and MCB components are, respectively, derived from the
hyperfine, spin relaxation, and Δg mechanisms
for spin conversion among the singlet and triplet states. The spin-selectivity
in recombination was elucidated by kinetic simulation of the dark
MCS,M effects for the SJ-cell. The nongeminate recombination
efficiency in the BJ-cell with η = 1.1% was estimated to ca.
40% at the short-circuit condition by simulation of the magnitude
of the light MCS,M effects. The relatively high ϕrec and same magnitude in order of kS and kT indicate the effective generation
of 3ex, which still has an electronic energy with a long
lifetime. The reuse of 3ex may be a key point to improve
the power conversion efficiency of P3HT:PCBM-cells.

5 Experimental Section
The SJ- and BJ-cells were fabricated
according to a standard procedure.19,28 Quartz glass
substrates coated with a transparent indium tin oxide
(ITO) electrode were successively cleaned by sonication in hexane,
acetone, and 2-propanol for 20 min, followed by oxygen plasma treatment
(PL16-110, Yodogawa Electric Blower). A hole buffer layer with a thickness
of ca. 50 nm was deposited on the plasma-treated substrates by spin-coating
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)/poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS;
AI4083, Clevous), which was filtrated with a filter (Millex-HV, Millipore)
before use, at 5000 rpm for 40 s. The buffer layer was then annealed
at 120 °C for 20 min. To deposit an active layer for the BJ-cell,
an o-dichlorobenzene solution of P3HT (Luminescence
Technology) and PCBM (Luminescence Technology) was then spin-coated
on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm for 28 s. This o-dichlorobenzene solution was prepared at 40 °C by overnight
stirring of an anhydrous solution comprised of 1.2 wt % solutes of
P3HT and PCBM in a weight ratio of 3:2 in o-dichlorobenzene
(Aldrich) solvent. The deposited active layer with a thickness of
ca. 100 nm was annealed at 110 °C for 20 min. For the active
layer for SJ-cell, an o-dichlorobenzene solution
with only P3HT was prepared in the same manner as the solution for
the BJ-cell and was spin-coated on the PEDOT:PSS layer at 800 rpm
for 10 s. After annealing at 120 °C for 20 min, a PCBM layer
with a thickness of ca. 50 nm was deposited under 2.0 × 10–3 Pa using a vacuum vapor deposition apparatus (VPC-260F,
ULVAC). Deposition of Al as a cathode on the active layers was performed
using another vacuum vapor deposition apparatus (VPC-260, ULVAC).
Finally, to prevent degradation by air exposure, SJ- and BJ-cells
were sealed under a N2 atmosphere using a glovebox.

The steady-state J versus V characteristics
of the device were observed using an in-house-built measurement system
combined with a source meter (2611, Keithley) and a solar simulator
(HAL-C100, Asahi Spectra). To detect the MC effect, B was applied parallel to the electric field (E)
of the bias voltage on the device using an electromagnet (TM-YSV6609J-021.5,
Tamagawa Factory). The strength of B was monitored
by a gaussmeter (421, LakeShore) placed close to the device. The transient
photocurrent (I) was measured using a nanosecond
pulsed laser with a wavelength (λ) of 532 nm (FDSS 532-150-I,
CryLas) to excite the main band of P3HT and a circuit comprised of
the solar cell in an electromagnet (TM-YSV5410-061.5, Tamagawa Factory)
and an external resistance of R = 50 Ω.29 The voltage change at the resistance (ΔV = IR) caused by irradiation was monitored
as a function t with a digital oscilloscope (DPO7104,
Tektronix). The incident photon flux was controlled in the range of
1012 to 1014 photons/(cm2 pulse)
by a glan laser prism located before the solar cell. V at the ITO electrode was changed using a variable DC power supply
(PLE-160-0.45, Matsusada Precision). All measurements were conducted
at room temperature.
