Teixobactin
is a recently discovered antimicrobial cyclodepsipeptide
with good activity against Gram positive bacteria. Taking Arg10–teixobactin as
a reference, where the nonproteinogenic residue l-allo-enduracididine
was substituted by arginine, a lysine scan was performed to identify
the importance of keeping the balance between hydrophilic and hydrophobic
amino acids for the antimicrobial activities of this peptide family.
Thus, the substitution of four isoleucine residues present in the
natural sequence by lysine led to a total loss of activity. On the
other hand, the substitution of the polar noncharged residues and
alanine by lysine allowed us to keep and in some cases to improve
the antimicrobial activity.

1 Introduction
Infectious
diseases, including tuberculosis (TB), cause major global
health problems.1−5 This awareness accompanied by the lobbying of some nongovernmental
organizations has fueled the renaissance of the search for new antibiotics.5 In this scenario, the publication on teixobactin
(1) (Figure 1) at the beginning of 2015 by Ling et al. raised a pronounced
expectation.6 Teixobactin is a head to
side-chain cyclodepsipeptide that exhibits good activity against Gram-positive
bacteria and TB.6−11 At the end of 2015, our group published the first synthesis of an
analogue of teixobactin, Arg10–teixobactin (2) (Figure 1), where the nonproteinogenic amino acid l-allo-enduracididine
was substituted by arginine.7,12

Figure 1 Structure of teixobactin
(1) and the Arg10–teixobactin analogue
(2).

Arg10–teixobactin
(2) exhibits similar
biological trends as teixobactin (1) by showing better
activity against Gram-positive bacteria than against Gram-negative
bacteria. However, Arg10–teixobactin (2) was shown to be 1 order of magnitude less active than the parent
compound. In 2016, two groups, Payne and co-workers and Li and co-workers,13,14 published the total synthesis of the natural product (1).

At a glance, the structure of teixobactin, an 11 amino acid
peptide,
can be defined as a scaffold formed by a linear segment constituted
with seven amino acid residues, which we named tail, followed by a
cyclic structure with four residues. In the cycle, a d-Thr
is at the bridgehead linked to an l-Ile, which contains a
guanidine side-chain amino acid, and the neutral alanine completes
the sequence. The tail end is an N-Me-d-Phe
and contains two more d-amino acids. Another characteristic
feature of this peptide is the presence in total of four isoleucine
and three polar uncharged residues (two serine and one glutamine).

Although the structure of this peptide was known only relatively
recently, there are already a few reports on its structure activity
relationship. In this regard, our group and Singh and co-workers independently
found that the activity was lost when the three d-amino acids
in the tail were substituted by the corresponding l-amino
acids (phenylalanine, glutamine, and isoleucine). This was also observed
when the N-Me-d-Phe at the N-terminal was substituted with N-Ac-d-Phe,
indicating the importance of a positive charge at the N-terminal.8,10

More recently and during
the completion of this study, Nowick and
co-workers have reported another bioactivity study, employing Arg10–teixobactin (2) as a reference.15 The main conclusions of their work are that
the Lys10–teixobactin (substitution of the arginine
by lysine) is more active than (2). Furthermore, the
absolute stereochemistry is insignificant. Thus, the enantiomer, where l has been substituted by d residues and vice versa,
maintains the activity. Finally, the residues 1–5 of the tail
could be substituted by a dodecanoyl group.

2 Results
and Discussion
In our current efforts to develop a more potent
analogue of teixobactin
and later to explore the mode of action of this family of compounds,
a lysine scan was carried out. Lysine scanning of a peptide involves
the preparation of a set of analogues, where each one contains a lysine
residue in a different position of the sequence while keeping the
same stereochemistry.16 In contrast to
alanine scanning, which is a more frequently used technique for the
identification of amino acids that are not key for biological activities,
lysine scanning has not been extensively reported in the literature
for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs).17,18

Lysine
scanning could be extremely important to speed up AMP medicinal
chemistry programs because it may render analogues with a better potency
and is more easily modifiable through the substitution of lysine by
other basic residues.19

In this sense,
eight analogues containing l-Lys at positions
2, 3, 6, 7, 9, and 11 and d-Lys at positions 4 and 5 were
prepared. Because d-Thr is
essential for creating the ester bond and to build up the depsipeptide
cycle, the corresponding lysine analogue at the bridgehead position
8 was not prepared. Also, neither the analogue at position 1 (importance
was previously established by our group)10 nor the one at position 10 (reported by the group of Nowick and
co-workers)15 was investigated in this
study. The eight lysine analogues covered the substitution of the
four hydrophobic isoleucine (represented by the red color in Figure 2), the three polar
uncharged residues 2× serine, glutamine(represented by the green
color in Figure 2),
and the neutral alanine (represented by the yellow color in Figure 2) by lysine.

Figure 2 Illustration
of lysine scanning on the Arg10–teixobactin
analogue.

Table 1 clearly
shows that the substitution of four isoleucine (three l- and one d-allo) by lysine led to a total loss of
activity. On the other hand, the substitution of the three polar uncharged
amino acids, (Ser3, Gln4, and Ser7) and the neutral Ala9 maintained or improved the activity
in some cases. Thus, these data show that there is a relative balance
between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts in teixobactin analogues.
As shown in Table 1, introducing a polar positively charged residue into the new analogues
instead of a polar uncharged residue improved the activity against
some strains in comparison with the reference Arg10–teixobactin
(2). (For example, Lys3–Arg10–teixobactin shows better activity against the two bacterial
strains Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli than the reference
Arg10–teixobactin. Also, it shows
minimal activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas the reference
shows no activity against the same strains). Furthermore, Lys4–Arg10–teixobactin and Lys9–Arg10–teixobactin exhibit activity against
Staphylococcus aureus and B. subtilis strains close to Arg10–teixobactin and better activity against E. coli and P. aeruginosa
strains than the reference. This will facilitate the possibility of
finding analogues with improved activity by substituting lysine by
other basic residues such as arginine.

3 Experimental
Section
3.1 Materials
All reagents and solvents
were obtained from commercial suppliers and used without further purification.
Analytical high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) was performed
on an Agilent 1100 system, and the Chemstation software was used for
data processing. Buffer A was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O, and buffer B was 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in CH3CN.
Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) was
performed on a Shimadzu 2020 ultrafiltration-LC–MS using an
YMC-Triart C18 (5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) column, and data processing
was carried out using the Lab Solution software. Buffer A was 0.1%
formic acid in H2O, and buffer B was 0.1% formic acid in
CH3CN. Crude peptides were purified with a Shimadzu LC-8A
preparative HPLC using a Phenomenex Luna C18(2) 100 Å column
(10 μm × 250 mm). High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)
was acquired using a Bruker ESI-Q-TOF mass spectrometer in the positive
mode. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) was performed
on a Bruker MALDI-TOF Autoflex SmartBeam II system (Bruker Daltonics,
Bremen, Germany) using the MALDI matrix (α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic
acid).

3.2 Methods
The eight analogues were
synthesized using the solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) technique
as previously described.7,10 Succinctly, the synthesis
was started by anchoring a residue at position 9 [Fmoc-Ala-OH or Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH
in the case of the Lys9 analogue] to a chlorotrityl chloride
polystyrene resin (CTC-resin), and then the elongation of the peptide
chain was achieved by the use of Fmoc-amino acids until residue at
position 6 (isoleucine or lysine in the case of the Lys6 analogue, in all cases except in the synthesis where Lys11 analogue).
Then, the β-hydroxyl functional group of d-Thr, which
had been incorporated without protection, was acylated by Alloc-l-Ile-OH, followed by the incorporation of Alloc-Arg(Pbf)-OH.
Finally, the Fmoc-based synthesis was continued until the incorporation
of Boc-N-Me-d-Phe-OH, whereas in the synthesis
of the analogue Lys11, the Fmoc-SPPS was performed until
the incorporation of Boc-N-Me-d-Phe-OH,
and then the esterification of the threonine amino acid was carried
out by Fmoc-Lys(Boc)-OH followed by the incorporation of Fmoc-Arg(Pbf)-OH.

The cleavage of the semiprotected peptide, having the free α-amino
acid group of arginine and the carboxylic group of alanine or lysine
in the case of the Lys9 analogue, was carried out with
0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dichloromethane followed by cyclization
using ((7-azabenzotriazol-1-yloxy)tripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate/ethyl
cyano(hydroxyimino)acetate/diisopropylethylamine, 3:3:6). The final
global deprotection was enabled with TFA/triisopropylsilane/H2O (95:2.5:2.5), and the peptides were purified using HPLC
and characterized using HRMS (see the Supporting Information). The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
determined as previously described, with meropenem as the control
(see the Supporting Information).10

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
performing a lysine scan has allowed the identification
of the essential residues for maintaining the balance between the
hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids for the antimicrobial activity
of teixobactin analogues. Thus, the substitution of any of the isoleucine
residues by lysine rendered the compound with a total loss of activity.
Furthermore, the substitution of the three polar uncharged amino acids
and alanine by lysine allowed us to sustain the antimicrobial potency
and in some cases to improve it. We envisage that the lysine scanning
will become a useful tool for the discovery of new AMPs as it has
been shown in this study.
