Microbial resistance to antibiotics
is an urgent and
worldwide concern. Several pyrazole-derived hydrazones were synthesized
by using benign reaction conditions. Several of these molecules are
potent growth inhibitors of drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter
baumannii with minimum inhibitory concentration values
as low as 0.39 μg/mL. Furthermore, these molecules are nontoxic
to human cells at high concentrations. Some of these molecules were
tested for their ability to disrupt the bacterial membrane by using
the SYTO-9/propidium iodide (BacLight) assay.

Introduction
Antibiotic resistance
is escalating to dangerously high levels all
over the world. Without an imperative and coordinated action, we are
heading for a post-antibiotic era, in which common infections and
minor injuries could kill a person. Scarcity of effective antibiotics
to treat antibiotic-resistance infections is putting modern medicine
such as chemotherapy, surgeries, and organ transplantation at risk.
To prevent and control the spread of antibiotic resistance, investment
in research and development of new antibiotics, vaccines, and diagnostic
tools is urgent.1

Staphylococcus aureus, a Gram-positive bacterium,
is a leading cause of infection in US healthcare facilities. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is resistant to several antibiotics.
In the community, MRSA often causes skin infections as well as more
serious infections such as pneumonia (lung infection). Untreated MRSA
can cause sepsis and even death. In healthcare settings, such as hospitals
and nursing homes, this drug-resistant bacterium can cause bloodstream
infections, pneumonia, and surgical site infections. Approximately,
2% of the general population and 5% of patients in the US carry MRSA
in their nares or on their skin. More than 119 000 bloodstream
staphylococcal infections occurred, and nearly 20 000 people
died with this infection in 2017.2Acinetobacter baumannii, a Gram-negative bacterium,
can cause a variety of diseases including pneumonia or blood or wound
infections. This bacterium may colonize in patients without causing
infection or symptoms in healthy people. Acinetobacter may cause severe problems to people with weakened immune systems,
chronic lung disease, or diabetes. A. baumannii is often resistant to commonly prescribed antibiotics.3 Since 2003, the beginning of the Iraq war, several
US service members have been infected by A. baumannii making an enormous problem in veterans. So, this bacteria is also
called Iraquibacter.4,5 In 2017, the World Health Organization
(WHO) has released a list of 12 drug-resistant bacteria that pose
the greatest threat to human health and for which new antibiotics
are desperately needed. Carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (CRAB) is on top of the list.6,7 CRAB infection is associated
with high morbidity and mortality as well as it has the potential
to cause outbreaks and spread resistance.8 It is very challenging to find novel molecules that can inhibit
the growth of nonfermenting bacteria such as A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, which are often
multidrug resistant.9A.
baumannii has a highly impermeable outer membrane
that prevents the uptake of most molecules including several antibiotics.10

Results and Discussion
In our pursuit
to find novel small-molecule heterocycles,11−15 we have reported the synthesis and antimicrobial
activities of several pyrazole-derived hydrazones.16−19 Based on our
reported molecules, we designed and synthesized fluorine-substituted
aldehydes to synthesize hydrazone derivatives for antimicrobial studies.
Fluorine substitution has been extensively studied in drug discovery
to enhance the biological activity and increase the chemical and metabolic
stability of the resultant molecules.20 The starting materials, fluorophenyl derivatives (1), were synthesized in the multigram scale by using our established
procedure.17,18 Reactions of 4-hydrazinobenzoic
acid with
fluorophenyl acetophenones (2) afford the hydrazone derivatives.
The evaporation of the solvent followed by the reaction with POCl3/DMF affords the aldehyde derivatives (3a and 3b) in a one-pot reaction (Scheme 1). Reactions of the aldehyde derivatives
with different hydrazines afforded the target molecules. All of the
synthesized molecules were tested against a total of 14 Gram-positive
and Gram-negative bacterial strains.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of Fluorophenyl-Derived
Pyrazole Aldehyde
The first compound, N-methyl-N-phenyl derivative (4), showed moderate growth inhibition of the tested bacteria. N,N-Bisphenyl derivative (5) showed very good
activity against a methicillin-sensitive S. aureus strain with an MIC value of 3.125 μg/mL concentration. This
molecule also showed excellent activity against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains: S. aureus ATCC 33591 (Sa91), S. aureus ATCC
33592 (Sa92), S. aureus ATCC 700699
(Sa99) with MIC value as low as 0.78 μg/mL. Potent growth inhibition
of these three MRSA strains is very significant as they have SCC mec
II or III genomic islands conferring multidrug resistance.21 This compound (5) inhibited the
growth of S. epidermis 700296 (Se)
with an MIC value of 3.125 μg/mL. S. epidermidis is an opportunistic pathogen, which is a part of normal human microbiota.22 Last but not the least, this novel molecule
(5) inhibited the growth of B. subtilis with an MIC value of 1.56 μg/mL, making it a good candidate
for further testing against B. anthracis, a potential biological warfare agent.23N-Benzyl-N-phenyl derivative (6) was found to be very potent across all of the tested Gram-positive
strains with an MIC value as low as 1.56 μg/mL. N,N-Dibenzyl derivative (7) showed less potency against
the staphylococcal species but inhibited the growth of B. subtilis at 1.56 μg/mL concentration. Chloro
substitution on the phenyl hydrazone moiety decreased the activity
of the molecule (8) with an MIC value as low as 3.125
μg/mL against MRSA. Bromo substitution (9 and 10) also showed similar results with decreased MIC values.
Bisfluoro-substituted derivative (11) showed activity
with an MIC value of 3.125 μg/mL against the multi-drug-resistant
strain, S. aureus ATCC 33592 (Sa92).
Bischloro substitution (12) increased the activity of
the resultant compound several fold. This compound (12) is the most potent compound in the series with an MIC value of
0.39 μg/mL against the multiresistant staph strain (Sa92). 3-Chloro-2-fluoro
derivative (13) also showed very good activity against
these antibiotic-resistant strains with an MIC value as low as 0.78
μg/mL. Polyfluorinated derivatives (14 and 15) showed moderate activity against the tested strains as
did the 4-trifluoromethy phenyl derivative (16). 4-Nitro
substitution (17) showed strong activity against some
of the tested strains with an MIC value of 0.78 μg/mL. The addition
of carboxylic acid (18) and heterocycles (19, 20, and 21) completely ceased the activity
of the resultant hydrazone derivatives (Table 1).

(Sa92), S. epidermidis 700296 (Se), B. subtilis ATCC 6623 (Bs), and NA = No Activity
Likewise, the
4-fluorophenyl-derived
aldehyde (3b) was treated with different hydrazine derivatives
to synthesize the corresponding hydrazones (Table 2). Due to solubility issues, we could not
characterize and test several compounds of this series. Decreased
solubility in dimethyl sulfoxide solvent may be due to the symmetrical
nature of the 4-flurophenyl substituent. Nevertheless, the following
compounds were synthesized in good yields, and these compounds were
tested for their growth inhibition properties against 14 bacterial
strains. N-Methyl-N-phenyl derivative
(22) showed moderate activity with an MIC value as low
as 6.25 μg/mL against one of the MRSA strains. N,N-Diphenyl derivative (23) showed very potent activity
with an MIC value as low as 0.78 μg/mL. This compound (23) also inhibited the growth of B. subtilis with an MIC value of 1.56 μg/mL concentration. Surprisingly,
no activity was observed against S. epidermidis. N-Benzyl-N-phenyl derivative
(24) failed to show any significant activity against
the tested strains of bacteria. N,N-Dibenzyl derivative
(25) showed moderate activity against some of the strains
with an MIC value as low as 3.125 μg/mL. Fluoro- and bromo-substituted
derivatives (26, 27, and 28) showed moderate activity against the tested strains. 3-Chloro-2-fluorophenyl-substituted
derivative (29) showed good activity against the two
strains of MRSA with an MIC value as low as 1.56 μg/mL. Cyano-substituted
derivative (30) showed moderate activity against the
tested Gram-positive strains of bacteria, and no activity was observed
for the nitro derivative (31). Similar to the previous
class of compounds, carboxylic acid and other substitution (32–35) did not show any significant potency
against the tested strains. We have reported several pyrazole derivatives
as anti-MRSA agents,16,17,19,24 but compound 13 is the most
potent compound found to date with an MIC of 0.39 μg/mL.

700699 (Sa99), S. aureus ATCC 33592
(Sa92), S. epidermidis 700296 (Se), B. subtilis ATCC 6623 (Bs), and NA = No Activity
All of the above
compounds were tested against the seven Gram-negative
bacterial strains. Some of these compounds showed moderate activity
against A. baumannii strains, but none
of the compounds showed any activity against the other four strains
of Gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 (Ec), E. aerogenes ATCC
13048 (Ea), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27833
(Pa), and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC
700603 (Kp). Only three derivatives (8, 9, and 10) of 3-fluorphenyl-derived aldehyde showed moderate
activity against the three strains of A. baumannii with the lowest MIC value being 3.125 μg/mL. 4-Fluorophenyl-derived
hydrazones (3) also showed moderate activity against the strains of A. baumannii (Table 3).

Although hydrazones
possess greater intrinsic
hydrolytic stability than the corresponding imines but still these
molecules can be converted into the starting materials by reacting
with water under the physiological condition (Scheme 2).25 The antimicrobial
activity of the compounds, hydrazones, may due to the hydrolyzed products,
aldehydes, and hydrazines. To test this possibility, the starting
materials of one of the most potent molecules (i.e., 12) were tested against S. aureus ATCC
700699 (Sa99). The aldehyde derivative (3a) did not show
any activity, but the hydrazine (36) showed weak growth
inhibition with an MIC value of 25 μg/mL. The reaction mixture
(3a and 36) also showed the similar activity
of hydrazine. Thus, we can conclude that the antimicrobial activity
of the compounds is due to their hydrazone functional groups not due
to their possible hydrolyzed products.

Corresponding Aldehyde
(3a) and Hydrazine (36)
Compounds showing potent
antimicrobial activity were tested against a human embryonic kidney
(HEK293) cell line for their in vitro toxicity. Potent compounds did
not show any noticeable cytotoxicity at the MIC concentration. IC50 values for the compounds are more than 10 μg/mL. High
IC50 values and low MIC values for compounds 5, 12, and 23 indicate suitability for further
drug development (Figure 1). Furthermore, these new compounds were submitted to the
National Cancer Institute (NCI) for cytotoxicity studies against NCI-60
cancer cell lines. None of the compounds showed any substantial growth
inhibition activity against these cancer cell lines at 10 μM
concentration. Hence, these fluorophenyl-derived pyrazole derivatives
(4–35) are nontoxic to human cell
lines.

Figure 1 Cytotoxicity studies
of some potent compounds.

The bacterial membrane is one of the key targets of antibacterial
agents. Antibiotics targeting bacterial membranes could be the key
to solve bacterial resistance to antibiotics.26 Seven potent compounds (8, 21, 22, 30, 31, 32, and 33) were tested for their membrane permeability for the A. baumannii ATCC 19606 strain by using the SYTO/9-PI
assay (Figure 2). Compounds 21 and 22 have shown better membrane disruption
ability than the positive control, Colistin (C).

Calculated
Physicochemical Properties
Physicochemical
properties of the six most potent compounds (5, 6, 12, 13, 23, and 29) were calculated by using the SwissAMDE, a freely available
online software (http://www.swissadme.ch/index.php). The n-octanol/water partition coefficient (ilogP) is an important parameter for the
drug design
and development. The ilogP values
are mostly <4.0, which are within the acceptable range (Table 4). Topological total
surface area of these molecules is less than 140 Å, which indicates
the potential for very good passive transport through the cell membranes.27

Correlations
of antimicrobial activity
and the energy of lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) orbitals
have been reported previously.26,28 We calculated the energy
of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO), LUMO orbital and HOMO–LUMO
energy gap by using the density functional theory calculation (see
the Supporting Information). Unfortunately,
for our molecules, we did not find any good correlation.

Conclusions
In summary, we have efficiently
synthesized several potential antibiotics by using benign reaction
conditions and readily available starting materials. Several of these
molecules have been found to be potent growth inhibitors of MRSA and B. subtilis. These molecules are significantly less
toxic to human cell lines, which make them potential candidates for
further antibiotic development. Design, synthesis, and antimicrobial
studies of novel molecules based on the lead structures of this manuscript
are in progress and will be reported soon.

Experimental Section
General
Consideration
All of the reactions were carried out under
the air atmosphere
in round-bottom flasks. Solvents for reactions, recrystallizations
and deuterated solvents for 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy
were purchased from Fisher Scientific and Oakwood chemical.

Synthesis
of Hydrazone Derivatives16,17,24
A mixture of 4-hydrazinobenzoic
acid (1, 1.597 g, 10.5 mmol) and 1-(3-fluorophenyl)ethanone
(2, 1.381 g, 10 mmol) in ethanol was refluxed for 8 h.
The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the hydrazone
derivative was further dried in vacuo. The dried product was subjected
to the next reaction without further isolation or purification. The
fluorophenyl-derived product in anhydrous N,N-dimethyl formamide (30 mL) was stirred for 15 min to dissolve
the solid material completely. The clear solution was chilled in an
ice bath, and phosphorous oxychloride (POCl3, 4.67 mL,
50 mmol) was added dropwise. The reaction mixture was brought to an
ambient temperature after 30 min and then heated for 8 h at 80 °C.
After the completion of the reaction, the hot reaction mixture was
decanted onto the ice in a beaker and the mixture was stirred for
12 h to precipitate the product. The solid product was filtered and
washed with water repeatedly until the filtrate was clear. The aldehyde
product (3a and 3b) was further dried in
vacuo to get the pure pyrazole-derived aldehyde in a very good overall
yield.

MIC Studies17,24
All of the synthesized
compounds were tested for antimicrobial
properties, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined
by broth microdilution plate-based technique as per Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute (CLSI) procedures. In short, bacterial strains
were streaked onto Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA) or TSA with 5% sheep blood
plates. The streaked plates were incubated at 35 °C overnight.
Isolated colonies were suspended in 0.9% NaCl sterile saline to match
a 0.5 MacFarland standard. The suspension was further diluted 1:100
with the Mueller Hinton broth to an approximate 1 × 106 CFU/mL concentration. Compounds were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) to a 2 mg/mL concentration and further diluted serially 1:2
in microplates such that after the addition of bacteria solution in
broth, the final concentrations began at 50 μg/mL. The inhibition
of bacterial growth or viability was determined using resazurin as
a colorimetric assay.29 Resazurin solution
was added with the bacterial suspension to 8 μg/mL final concentration,
and the microplates were incubated at 35 °C for 20–24
h to read them visually. Negative controls (bacteria without inhibitors),
technical control (bacteria plus serially diluted DMSO), and positive
controls (bacteria plus a serially diluted antibiotic) were included
on every plate. The MIC value was the lowest concentration where there
was no color change of resazurin from purple (resorufin) to red (resazurin)
(evidence of the bacterial growth).

Cytotoxicity Studies
In vitro toxicity studies of the potent
compounds were accomplished according to our reported modified procedure.17,24 HEK293 cells were counted using a Countess automated cell counter,
and 4000 cells per well were seeded in black 96-well plates. Compounds
were serially diluted starting at 50 μg/mL, added in triplicate,
and incubated for 24 h. Resazurin solution (5%) for a final volume
of 240 μL in each well was added after 24 h. After the addition
of 5% resazurin, plates were incubated for 4 and 6 h before taking
the readings for cell viability. Fluorescence was measured at 544
nm (excitation) and 590 nm (emission) using a BMG Labtech Fluostar
Optima plate reader.

SYTO-9/PI Studies
BacLight assay
(Invitrogen) was used to assess the membrane permeability
of the bacterium A. baumannii ATCC
19606 following the treatment with our pyrazole-derived compounds
using the reported procedure26,30 with a slight modification
described below. SYTO-9 is a green fluorescent protein, which freely
permeates into all bacterial cells and increases in fluorescent intensity
when bound to DNA. This provides a baseline measurement of the total
bacteria found in a single well, which can then be compared to the
fluorescent intensity of propidium iodide (PI). Propidium iodide is
much less permeable to the cell membrane but also increases in fluorescent
intensity once it enters the cell and binds to DNA. PI is expected
to only show a strong signal when significant membrane damage is present,
so our compound treatments can be compared to negative controls and
we can conclude if membrane damage has or has not occurred. In earlier
experiments, our compounds have demonstrated a bleaching effect on
the PI signal (results not shown), therefore we must remove our compounds
from the cell suspension by centrifugation prior to reading our plates.

Ab 19606 was grown in cation adjusted Mueller Hinton broth at 37
°C with shaking to reach the log phase growth and an OD 600 nm
of 0.2. The cultures were centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min, the cell pellet was washed once with sterile water,
resuspended so that the final optical density of the cell suspension
was 0.2 OD, and aliquoted into separate wells of a 24-well-plate (780
μL/well), then test compounds were added (20 μL/well)
at the MIC concentration as well as double the MIC and two 1:2 dilution
factors below MIC. Suspensions were incubated at 37 °C with shaking
for 1 h and then moved to individual microcentrifuge tubes and were
centrifuged at 10 000g for 10 min, washed
once with sterile water, and resuspended in 800 μL of water.
A 1:1 mixture of SYTO-9 (1 μg/mL) and propidium iodide (1 mg/mL)
was added to the suspension (3 μL/mL) and mixed well. The mixture
(100 μL) was added to each well of a black opaque 96-well plate,
and the plates were incubated in the dark for 15 min at room temperature.
Green fluorescence (SYTO-9) was read at 530 nm, and red fluorescence
(PI) was read at 645 nm (excitation wavelength, 485 nm). The ratio
of green to red fluorescence was expressed as a percentage of the
control.
