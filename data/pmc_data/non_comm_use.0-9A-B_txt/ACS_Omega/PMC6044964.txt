Manipulating gelation properties
of the isomeric zinc–terpyridine
complexes C-1 (nongelator) and C-2 (gelator) using three different
luminescent dyes, viz., acridine yellow (AY), ethidium bromide (EB),
and azido-boron dipyrromethene, have been described. Hybrid gels created
by the combination of C-1, C-2, and above-mentioned dyes have been
termed complex-luminogen mixed gels (CLMGs). Ensuing CLMGs have been
thoroughly characterized by spectral, morphological, and rheological
studies. Cytotoxicity measurements and imaging against breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231 unveiled that three out of the five CLMGs can
be effectively used for cell imaging. Interestingly, direct use of
the metal-containing hybrid gels for live cell imaging which is a
distinctive approach, has been successfully achieved with significantly
encouraging results.

Introduction
Low molecular weight
gels (LMWGs) have seen a large surge since
past decade because of their potential applications in diverse areas,
such as adhesive materials, molecular electronics, optoelectronics,
sensing, tissue engineering, drug delivery, pharmaceuticals, cell
culture, and so forth.1−12 There are several types of LMWGs, but metallogel is the one, which
allows numerous solvents/ligands/metals to provide gels under various
stimuli and is hence considered to be advantageous over other members
of LMWGs.2,13−15 Currently, inorganic–organic
hybrid gels have emerged as a magnificent successor of the metallogels
in the LMWG category. Regulated by different physical interactions
at the molecular level, they are often termed physical gels.16−18 It plays a vital role in retaining the native properties of the
components ensuing versatility in their applications. Accordingly,
terpyridyl complexes with extensive π-electronic conjugation
and heteroatom-rich planar structures have shown great promise in
metallo/multicomponent gelation.19−23 Further, the chelated terpyridyl moieties can generate
frequent weak intermolecular interactions, and in addition, they have
shown multifaceted applicability in biological fields.20,24−30

On the other hand, luminogens such as acridine yellow (AY)
and
ethidium bromide (EB) are widely used in biology. AY with its rich
dye chemistry finds utility in solar cells, catalytic oxidation, biodegradation,
spectrofluorometric analyses, and other investigative purposes,31−36 whereas EB serves as a classic staining agent for various biological
systems.37−41 Despite its toxicity, mutagenicity, and carcinogenicity, EB is a
known fluorescent tag used in molecular biology. Considering its selective
exclusion by live cells, it is largely used for in vitro experiments
as a staining agent to detect cell death.42,43 A closer look at their structure shows that they possess heteroatom-rich
planar moieties and substantial π-electronic conjugation. On
the basis of these features, they undergo different intermolecular
interactions in multicomponent systems and hence hold the promise
for multicomponent gelation. Interestingly, EB is ionic in nature,
whereas AY is neutral. Another class of luminogens having the potential
to assist gelation are the boron dipyrromethenes (BODIPYs), owing
to their aggregation affinity.44−48 Notably, rich photochemistry and biocompatibility49−52 of BODIPYs have been extensively
explored and have shown great promise in the fabrication of hybrid
materials as well.52−60

Through an earlier communication, we reported that a zinc–terpyridyl
complex Zn-TRPA-2 (C-2) produces a weak metallogel ZTP2G when triggered
by an anion (Cl–), wherein the isomeric complex
Zn-TRPA-1 (C-1) could not form a proper gel under analogous conditions.61 Now in this work, following a similar gelation
trajectory, we have tried to develop a series of multicomponent gels
with potent biological applicability. To synthesize those multicomponent
gels, the same isomeric pair of complexes, that is, C-1 and C-2, 
have been combined separately with three different luminogens of varying
structural aspects, viz., acridine yellow (L-1), ethidium bromide
(L-2), and azido-BODIPY (L-3) (Scheme 1). Every possible combination, that is, picking one
complex and a luminogen at once, when triggered with the anion Cl– afforded the series of gels, referred to as “complex-luminogen
mixed gels” (CLMGs). After thorough morphological, photophysical,
and rheological characterization of these CLMGs, we went on to investigate
their possible applicability in live cell imaging which was evaluated
in vitro against the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Another interesting
fact associated with the present study is that we have used the CLMGs
as dispersed fibers rather than the native form for entire set of
biological experiments.

Scheme 1 Luminogens L-1–L-3 Used in the Complex-Luminogen
Mixed Gelation
Results and Discussion
Multicomponent gels, viz., CLMG-12 (C-1/L-2), CLMG-13 (C-1/L-3),
CLMG-21 (C-2/L-1), CLMG-22 (C-2/L-2), and CLMG-23 (C-2/L-3), have
been synthesized (Scheme 2) and thoroughly characterized by elemental analysis, infrared
(IR) and 1H NMR, atomic force microscopy (AFM), field emissive
scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), UV–vis, and fluorescence spectroscopic and rheological
studies.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Routes Adopted for CLMGs Starting from the Complexes
C-1
and C-2
IR and 1H NMR
Spectroscopy
For IR and 1H NMR spectral studies,
synthesized CLMGs have been air-dried.
The IR spectrum of C-1 exhibited characteristic alkyne (−C≡C−)
stretching at 2113 cm–1, whereas for C-2, it vibrated
at 2124 cm–1. Interestingly, alkyne stretching showed
a marked shift (2121 cm–1, CLMG-12 and 2119 cm–1, CLMG-13) for CLMGs relative to (Figure S1) Zn(II) complexes. Similar results have been observed
for CLMG-21 (2127 cm–1), CLMG-22 (2129 cm–1), and CLMG-23 (2125 cm–1) also involving C-2 (Figure S2). Flattening/weakening of the existing
bands and emergence of new bands for these CLMGs relative to the complex
further suggested weak intermolecular interactions between the components
in these systems. 1H NMR spectra of the CLMGs have been
acquired in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d6 (due to poor solubility of the dried gels in methanol-d4) and compared with respective complex components (1H NMR of C-1/C-2; also acquired in DMSO-d6). Here too, comparative studies revealed some interesting
results. For example, aromatic protons of the terpyridyl moiety resonated
at δ 9.22 ppm in complex C-1 which experienced a huge upfield
shift in CLMG-12 (δ 8.83; Δδ ≈ 0.38 ppm)
and CLMG-13 (δ 8.88; Δδ ≈ 0.34 ppm). Again,
methylene protons (−CH2−) of the alkyne chain
of C-1 (δ 5.03 ppm) shifted upfield (δ 4.90, Δδ
≈ 0.14 ppm, CLMG-12 and δ 4.94, Δδ ≈
0.09 ppm, CLMG-13) (Figure S3). Similarly,
terpyridyl protons of C-2 (δ 9.33 ppm) resonated at δ
9.00 ppm for CLMG-21 (Δδ ≈ 0.34 ppm), δ 8.99
ppm for CLMG-22 (Δδ ≈ 0.35 ppm), and δ 8.92
ppm for CLMG-23 (Δδ ≈ 0.41 ppm). The methylene
protons (−CH2−) of the alkyne chain (δ
5.021 ppm) upfield-shifted (δ 4.94, Δδ ≈
0.08 ppm, CLMG-21; δ 4.93, Δδ ≈ 0.09 ppm,
CLMG-22; and δ 4.91, Δδ ≈ 0.11 ppm, CLMG-23)
(Figure S4). A significant shift for the
characteristic signals in the spectra of CLMGs relative to the respective
complexes strongly advocated the occurrence of substantial weak intermolecular
interactions in these multicomponent systems.

Morphology and Fluorescence
Microscopy
AFM, SEM, and
TEM analyses revealed a fibrous network in the CLMGs. AFM analyses
on CLMGs and ZTP2G have been made by taking equal strength of their
diluted solutions (5 × 10–5 M). Images unveiled
a rootlike entangled network for CLMG-12 (Figure 1b), long fibers (Figure 1c) with an arrangement similar to SATA cables
for CLMG-13, a spider web-like network (Figure 1d) for CLMG-21, thin tape-like fibers for
CLMG-22 (Figure 1e),
and normal optical cable-like arrangement for fibers in CLMG-21 (Figure 1f). Notably, fibers
of ZTP2G (Figure 1a)
showed a thin thread-like morphology. The distinctive difference in
the construction of fibers of pure metallogel (ZTP2G) to hybrid matrices
(CLMGs) could be easily understood from the AFM analyses. SEM analyses
corroborated well with the observations made from AFM studies. SEM
images revealed that ZTP2G acquired entangled threads (Figure 1g) similar to that observed
in AFM. For CLMGs too, SEM images are concordant to that of AFM (Figure 1h–l). TEM
analyses provided significant information about the average dimension
of the fibers. It showed that CLMG-12 fibers have an average dimension
of ∼10 nm and CLMG-13 fibers have an average dimension of ∼5
nm (Figure 1n,o). The
average fiber dimensions for CLMG-21, CLMG-22, and CLMG-23 have been
found to be ∼15, ∼6, and ∼8 nm, respectively
(Figure 1p–r).
Contextually, the average dimension for ZTP2G fibers was reported
to be ∼30 nm.61 Further, fluorescence
microscopy images suggested that the synthesized CLMG fibers along
with ZTP2G are fluorescent in nature and emit brightly under blue,
green, or red filters (Figure 2).

Figure 1 Morphological analyses: (a–f) AFM images (scale bar: 1 μm),
(g–l) FESEM images (scale bar: 1 μm), and (m–r)
TEM images (scale bar: 2 μm for m and 100 nm for n–r)
on the order: ZTP2G, CLMG-12, CLMG-13, CLMG-21, CLMG-22, and CLMG-23,
clearly showing that CLMG fibers differ not only from each other with
respect to their shape, arrangements, and dimensions but also from
the ZTP2G (metallogel) fibers as well.

Figure 2 Fluorescence microscopy images for ZTP2G, CLMG-12, CLMG-13, CLMG-21,
CLMG-22, and CLMG-23 showing aggregated nanofibers (obtained by diluting
the gels with MeOH to 10–3 M) can emit under blue,
green, or red filters (scale bars: 100 μm).

UV–Vis and Fluorescence Spectroscopic Analyses
To
investigate the interactions associated with the multicomponent
gelation, UV–vis studies have been performed. An attempt has
been made to work out whether the components in each CLMG are reactive
toward each other under exclusive conditions (i.e., in the absence
of a third species such as anion Cl–). Addition
of L-1 to C-1 (in MeOH) led to a mere overlap of their individual
spectrum without any significant shift in characteristic bands (Figure S5a). However, the addition of HCl (0.75
M) to the resulting solution (C-1/L-1) led to a blue shift accompanied
by an isosbestic point for the intraligand charge-transfer transition
(ICT) band61,62 (340 nm) assignable to C-1. It
indicated the replacement of NO3– from
C-1 triggered by anion Cl–. Other combinations,
viz., C-1/L-2, C-1/L-3, C-2/L-1, C-2/L-2, and C-2/L-3 too, displayed
similar patterns (Figure S5). For L-3 characteristic,
π–π* transition associated with the BODIPY moiety
has been observed at ∼500 nm.63−65 UV–vis analyses
suggested that complexes and luminogens are essentially nonreactive
to each other; thus, only weak intermolecular interactions might occur.

Fluorescence spectroscopic studies have also been performed to
realize the interactions. The inorganic component C-1 (10–5 M; MeOH) emits at 475 nm (λex, 340 nm) because
of an ICT66 originating from the chelation
of the terpyridyl core with Zn2+. Upon the addition of
the luminogen L-1 (1.0 equiv) to a solution of C-1, the emission due
to C-1 appeared at 500 nm with a red shift of 25 nm (Figure S6). This may be attributed to the enhanced ICT in
C-1 under the influence of a luminogen. Further, the addition of HCl
(0.75 M) quenched the emission of the resulting solution, demonstrating
the molecular assembly, that is, nanofibers formation triggered by
Cl–. Further, emission maxima retained its position
(500 nm) which suggested an insignificant change in the enhanced ICT.
Thus, even after aggregation, L-1 influences ICT in C-1. Similar observations
have been made for L-1 after its treatment with C-2 (Figure S6). A greater red shift of 50 nm (450 → 500
nm) has been observed for this system under analogous conditions,
suggesting greater influence of L-1 on the ICT for C-2 relative to
that on C-1. On the other hand, other combinations, viz., C-1/L-2,
C-1/L-3, C-2/L-2, and C-2/L-3, do not show any significant change.
Rather, in each case, quenching occurred implying the anion-triggered
self-assembly process.

Average Lifetime
Average lifetime
(τav) measurements have been performed on CLMGs which
revealed that CLMG-21
(5.88 ns) has highest lifetime followed by CLMG-12 (5.17 ns), CLMG-23
(4.75 ns), CLMG-22 (4.54 ns), and CLMG-13 (4.02 ns) (Figure 3). The average lifetime for
ZTP2G has been calculated to be 2.93 ns.61 Again, similar measurements have been made on luminogens L-1–L-3
exclusively, and thereafter, a comparative analysis has been performed
to realize the interaction between the components in the hybrid systems
(CLMGs). It has been found that τav of L-1 (3.54
ns) is greater than those of L-2 (3.45 ns) and L-3 (2.76 ns) (Figure S7), but all of these are much lower with
respect to CLMGs. The average lifetime signifies that species with
higher τav is likely to persist for longer period
in the excited state. Therefore, experimental results advocated that
luminogens do interact with complexes in CLMGs, and the extent of
interaction is greater in CLMG-12 relative to that in CLMG-13 which
further follows the order: CLMG-21 > CLMG-22 > CLMG-23. Nevertheless,
substantial lifetimes of these CLMGs supported their potential usage
in fluorescence imaging.

and ZTP2G showing
CLMG-21 with the highest average lifetime among the synthesized gels.

Rheological Analyses
Mechanical strength of the fibrous
self-assemblies has been worked out by performing rheological experiments
under analogous conditions. Viscoelastic behavior has been investigated
by rheological studies at room temperature using freshly prepared
CLMGs. Storage (or viscous, G′) and loss (or
elastic, G″) moduli of the CLMGs have been
measured as a function of dynamic oscillatory strain (γ) and
shear stress (τ) over a long range. Individual experiments with
each of the CLMGs have been performed to investigate whether the synthesized
materials satisfy the two essential criteria of a true gel phase,
that is, G′ > G″
and
Δ(G′ ≈ G″)
≥ 1 order, which evidently illustrated their gel character.

Experimental results showed the G′/G″ values for CLMG-12—2800 Pa/250 Pa; CLMG-13—2550
Pa/260 Pa; CLMG-21—420 Pa/40 Pa; CLMG-22—4800 Pa/380
Pa; and CLMG-23—12100 Pa/1150 Pa (Figures S8–12). Comparative changes in the viscoelastic properties
(storage/loss moduli) of the CLMGs from ZTP2G to CLMGs stimulated
by the luminogens are shown in Figure 4. G′/G″
values clearly indicated CLMG-22 with the strongest viscoelastic character
in this series. Such observed changes in rheological properties may
be attributed to the structural disparity of the luminogens. For example,
acridine yellow (L-1) has a nonionic structure, whereas both ethidium
bromide (L-2) and azido-BODIPY (L-3) are ionic. Therefore, L-2 and
L-3 are likely to involve in weak electronic interactions unlike L-1.
These weak electronic interactions aid in the strengthening of the
molecular gel network. Our experimental results have also suggested
for the same where it has been observed that G′/G″ for CLMG-21 is much lower than those for CLMG-22
or CLMG-23. On the other hand, metallogel ZTP2G displayed weak viscoelastic
characteristics with a G′ of 10 Pa and a G″ of 1 Pa.61 Experimental
evidences suggested that all luminogen hybridized CLMGs are quite
strong relative to the ones belonging to the metallogel ZTP2G.

Figure 4 Comparative
rheological plots showing (a) oscillation strain (γ)
sweep and (b) shear stress (τ) sweep of elastic or storage (G′) and loss (G″) moduli
of the synthesized gels. CLMG-23 has the highest storage/loss moduli,
whereas CLMG-21 has the least among the hybrid gels.

MTT Assay and Cytotoxicity
To have
an understanding
about the applicability of the gel nanofibers in biological systems,
assessment of their toxicity is crucial. In this regard, to realize
the cytotoxicity of the synthesized CLMGs and metallogel ZTP2G nanofibers,
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT)
assays have been performed against breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231.
Cells were treated with a range of concentrations (5–100 μM)
for each gel species. MTT assay revealed that it is not possible to
evaluate IC50 for ZTP2G nanofibers up to 100 μM,
indicating its nontoxic nature toward the cell line (Figure 5). Similar protocol was followed
for other CLMGs, and the results suggested that CLMG-12 and CLMG-13
(IC50 between 50 and 100 μM for each) showed negligible
toxicity, whereas CLMG-21 (IC50 ≈ 25 μM) displayed
toxicity toward cytoplasm of MDA-MB-231 cells. CLMG-22 and CLMG-23
(IC50 < 100 μM for each) were found to be nontoxic
to the cells as their IC50 values could not be achieved
up to the highest tested concentration (Figure 5). On the basis of the respective IC50 values, we conclude that only CLMG-21 shows significant
toxicity, whereas other CLMGs and metallogel ZTP2G should be considered
nontoxic to MDA-MB-231 cells.

Figure 5 MTT assay performed in the concentration range
(5–100 μM)
for each gel, revealed that CLMG-22 and CLMG-23 displayed IC50 > 100 μM, whereas CLMG-12 and CLMG-13 showed IC50 < 100 μM. The lowest IC50 value has been observed
for CLMG-21 which is ∼25 μM. Again, metallogel ZTP2G
displayed an IC50 of >100 μM. It is clear from
the
data that only CLMG-21 shows significant cytotoxicity.

Live Cell Imaging
Because the synthesized
gels emitted
strongly under the three primary emission filters, viz., red, green,
and blue, their efficacy as a biological staining agent has been evaluated
in vitro against breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. The cells were
incubated for 24 h with different concentrations (5–100 μM)
of ZTP2G and monitored by a fluorescent microscope. It was observed
that fibers are unable to stain the cells even at their highest concentration
(100 μM) (Figure 6); however, the dispersed CLMG fibers offered interesting results
when subjected to similar protocols. Cells treated with CLMG-13 and
CLMG-23 (50 μM each) fluoresced brightly under green and red
filters. CLMG-22 (50 μM) treated cells emitted brightly under
the red filter, whereas CLMG-21 (25 μM) treated ones emitted
selectively under the green filter. However, CLMG-12 fibers were unable
to stain the cells even at the highest permissible (50 μM) concentration.
Another interesting observation was that CLMG nanofibers stain only
the cytoplasm but not the nucleus. Taken together, fluorescence imaging
experiments in live cells suggested that these hybrid CLMGs may be
used explicitly for cytosolic staining, whereby they offer desirable
contrast during combinatorial fluorescence imaging with other fluorophores.

Figure 6 Live cell
imaging with MDA-MB-231 cells treated with dispersed
fibers of ZTP2G and CLMGs (scale bar: 100 μm). Upon treatment
with ZTP2G (100 μM) and CLMG-12 (50 μM), the cells could
not emit properly. When treated with CLMG-13 (50 μM) and CLMG-23
(50 μM), MDA-MB-231 cells emitted brightly under green and red
filters, whereas on treatment with CLMG-21 (25 μM) and CLMG-22
(50 μM), the cells emitted selectively under green and red filters,
respectively.

Another interesting inference
which ensues is that metallogel nanofibers
become potential cytosolic staining agents in combination with luminogens.
Combining our observations from the cytotoxicity analyses with their
staining potential, it can be concluded that CLMG-13, CLMG-22, and
CLMG-23 are sufficiently nontoxic and efficient cytosolic markers
for live cell imaging. To understand the role of precursor complexes
toward the applicability shown by the hybrid gel materials in live
cell imaging, similar experiments have been performed with C-1 and
C-2 as well (Figures S13 and 14). MTT assay
for C-1 and C-2 suggested that they are nontoxic as their IC50 values could not be achieved up to the highest tested concentration
(100 μM). MDA-MB-231 cells upon treatment with C-1 and C-2 emitted
effectively under blue and green filters by virtue of their fluorescent
nature. Once C-2 forms gel fibers (ZTP2G) via the self-assembly process,
its emission quenches. ZTP2G fibers are unable to make the cells emissive
under any of the blue/green/red filter. Our approach clearly shows
that it is the incorporation of luminogen in the hybrid gel system
that makes them suitable for fluorescence imaging of live cells. In
particular, this work illustrates an unparalleled trait of hybrid
gels riding on their excellent emission properties, that is, their
direct administration to the cells to furnish and serve as desired
fluorescence alternatives during live cell imaging.

Conclusions
This work deals with detailed synthesis of five anion-triggered
hybrid gels, their thorough characterization, and unconventional in
vitro applications. Syntheses of these hybrid gels have been carried
out by remodeling of complex nanofibers with simple luminogens. After
meticulous investigation on their diverse gel characteristics, interactions
between the components, and photophysical behavior, an off-center
approach has been realized, that is, comprehensive cytotoxicity assay
and live cell imaging performed using the synthesized materials. It
has been established that luminogen-derived gels CLMG-13, CLMG-22,
and CLMG-23 serve as efficient fluorescent staining agents for cell
cytoplasm and are suited for in vitro applications. This approach
finds itself unique in its kind because such explicit usage of a gel
fiber that performs the role of a fluorophore in live cell imaging
has not been illustrated earlier. This report also outlines an alternative
strategy for transportation of small molecules into the cell cytoplasm
transported by hybrid nanofibers. Again, ethidium bromide, a classical
biomarker for dead cells, finds an unorthodox usage in the live cell
imaging which marks this report as the pioneer in its class. From
another perspective, this report offers significant clue for the transportation
of ionic species through the cell membrane considering the ionic nature
of ethidium bromide.

C-1 (11.0 mg/mL) and 20 μM L-3 (7.10 mg) were mixed and stirred
well for 5 min to make it homogeneous. HCl (0.75 M) was added dropwise
to it. The appearance of fibrous aggregates with each drop was visible
by the naked eye. After the addition of 300 μL of acid, the
vial was inverted to check the stability of the gel (1.8 wt %). CHN analysis for C41H31BCl2F2N8O2Zn. Found: C, 57.68; H, 3.65;
N, 12.94; Calcd: C, 57.74; H, 3.66; N, 13.14.

CLMG-21
An almost similar procedure has been followed
for the synthesis of CLMG-21. In this case, 20 μM L-1 (4.7 mg)
was added to 1.0 mL of 20 μM methanolic C-2 (11.0 mg), followed
by 300 μL of 0.75 M HCl. The vial was kept undisturbed for 5–10
min and inverted to confirm gelation (1.47 wt %). CHN analysis for C39H32Cl2N6OZn.
Found: C, 63.18; H, 4.65; N, 10.94; Calcd: C, 63.56; H, 4.38; N, 11.40.

CLMG-22
Here, 20 μM L-2 (7.90 mg) was mixed thoroughly
with 1.0 mL of 20 μM C-2 (11.0 mg) prior to the dropwise addition
of 250 μL of 0.75 M HCl. Next, the vial was inverted to affirm
gelation (1.79 wt %). Elemental analysis for C39H32BrCl2N6OZn. Found: C, 59.90; H, 4.58; N, 9.12;
Calcd: C, 60.46; H, 4.17; N, 9.40.

CLMG-23
Almost
similar procedure has been followed
for the synthesis of CLMG-23. L-3 (20 μM, 7.10 mg) has been
added to 1.0 mL of 20 μM methanolic C-2 (11.0 mg), followed
by 250 μL of 0.75 M HCl. It was kept undisturbed for 1 min and
then inverted to confirm gelation (1.8 wt %). CHN analysis for C41H31BCl2F2N8O2Zn. Found: C, 57.62; H, 3.61; N, 13.04; Calcd:
C, 57.74; H, 3.66; N, 13.14.

MTT Assay and Cytotoxicity
MDA-MB-231 cells with a
density of 10 000 per well were seeded and subsequently treated
with different concentrations of ZTP2G, CLMG-12, CLMG-13, CLMG-21,
CLMG-22, and CLMG-23 in a 96-well tissue culture plate and incubated
in a CO2 incubator for 24 h. After incubation, MTT (5.0
mg/mL) was added into each well and left for additional 2 h at 37
°C. Formazan crystals were dissolved in 100 μL of DMSO,
and absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically on the ELISA plate
reader with an excitation wavelength of 570 nm. All the experiments
were carried out in triplicate, and IC50 values of each
sample were estimated.

Live Cell Imaging Experiments
To
check the fluorescence
effect of ZTP2G and CLMGs on cells, live cell imaging experiments
were performed after 24 h treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with CLMG-12,
CLMG-13, CLMG-21, CLMG-22, and CLMG-23. Images were captured in an
EVOS fluorescent microscope by Invitrogen.

Preparation of Samples
Compounds C-1/C-2 were dissolved
in methanol to obtain 1.0 × 10–2 M solutions,
and gels (2.0 × 10–2 M; real concentration
of CLMGs and ZTP2G) were diluted using methanol to obtain 1.0 ×
10–2 M solutions containing dispersed gel fibers.
The solution of compounds and gels were further diluted in the DMEM
to reach the concentration 1.0 × 10–4 M (or
100 μM). Final concentration of the gels (i.e., 100.0 μM)
has been used directly to the cell line. Different concentrations
of the gels (from 5 to 100 μM) were treated to the cells under
investigation, and final concentration of methanol in the cell culture
medium was less than 0.1 v/v %.
