Sonication-assisted
delamination of layered double hydroxides (LDHs) resulted in smaller-sized
LDH nanoparticles (∼50–200 nm). Such delaminated Co–Al
LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al LDH solutions were
used for the preparation of highly dispersed isotactic polypropylene
(iPP) nanocomposites. Transmission electron microscopy and wide-angle
X-ray diffraction results revealed that the LDH nanoparticles were
well dispersed within the iPP matrix. The intention of this study
is to understand the influence of the intralayer metal composition
of LDH on the various properties of iPP/LDH nanocomposites. The sonicated
LDH nanoparticles showed a significant increase in the crystallization
rate of iPP; however, not much difference in the crystallization rate
of iPP was observed in the presence of different types of LDH. The
dynamic mechanical analysis results indicated that the storage modulus
of iPP was increased significantly with the addition of LDH. The incorporation
of different types of LDH showed no influence on the storage modulus
of iPP. But considerable differences were observed in the flame retardancy
and thermal stability of iPP with the type of LDH used for the preparation
of nanocomposites. The thermal stability (50% weight loss temperature
(T0.5)) of the iPP nanocomposite containing
three-metal LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) is superior to that of
the nanocomposites made of two-metal LDH (Co–Al LDH and Zn–Al
LDH). Preliminary studies on the flame-retardant properties of iPP/LDH
nanocomposites using microscale combustion calorimetry showed that
the peak heat release rate was reduced by 39% in the iPP/Co–Zn–Al
LDH nanocomposite containing 6 wt % LDH, which is higher than that
of the two-metal LDH containing nanocomposites, iPP/Co–Al LDH
(24%) and iPP/Zn–Al LDH (31%). These results demonstrated that
the nanocomposites prepared using three-metal LDH showed better thermal
and flame-retardant properties compared to the nanocomposites prepared
using two-metal LDH. This difference might be due to the better char
formation capability of three-metal LDH compared to that of two-metal
LDH.

==== Body
Introduction
Layered materials are
an interesting class of compounds, consisting
of a two-dimensional (2D) sheet-like structure with strong bindings
within the individual layer and weak van der Waals forces between
the layers.1−4 The weak interaction between these layers allows them to be exfoliated
or delaminated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. These ultrathin nanomaterials
have gained significant interest after the discovery of exfoliated
graphene from graphite.5 Dozens of 2D nanomaterials
have been reported in the last few years, including transition metal
oxides, transition metal dichalcogenides, hexagonal boron nitride,
synthetic silicate clays, layered metal oxides, layered double hydroxides
(LDHs), etc.3,6−9 Because of the promising applications
of these ultrathin 2D nanomaterials, a large number of synthetic methods,
such as mechanical cleavage,5,10 chemical vapor deposition,11 ion-intercalation and exfoliation,2 liquid exfoliation,3,6 etc., have
been developed.

Polymer matrices filled with nanosized particles
have drawn widespread
attention of researchers due to the promise of combining the superior
thermal and mechanical properties of nanoparticles with the flexibility
and processability of polymers.7−9,12−16 The performance of the nanocomposites depends on many factors, such
as the degree of dispersion of nanoparticles in the polymer matrix,
compatibility between the nanoparticles and polymer, and the aspect
ratio of the nanofillers used.7−9,12−14 In recent years, a range of layered materials of
varying dimensions have been used as nanofillers in the preparation
of polymer nanocomposites due to their exciting properties.7−9,12,14,15

In recent times, LDHs, also known
as anionic clays, are considered
to be an emerging class of layered nanofillers for the preparation
of polymer nanocomposites.7,15−32 The flexibility in tuning the type of metal ions in inorganic layers,
as well as balancing anions in the interlayer space (easily exchangeable
with other anionic species), enables these materials to find many
applications, including in catalysis, pharmaceuticals, UV absorbents,
CO2 adsorbents, and flame-retardant additives.7,17,18,33,34 The exfoliation of LDH in the polymer matrix
is always a challenge because of the stronger interlayer electrostatic
interactions. Recently, liquid exfoliation of LDH has drawn increasing
attention as a process to produce ultrathin nanosheets with drastically
improved surface activity.4,18,21,28,35,36 This method is preferred over the other
methods by polymer scientists, as the aggregation of exfoliated nanosheets
can be prevented by polymers, which results in the formation of highly
dispersed polymer/LDH nanocomposites by the solution blending method.18,21,36,37 Moreover, this method does not require the prior modification of
LDH with organic modifiers or surfactants. The degree of dispersion
and the exfoliation of layered materials in polymer matrices have
been shown to improve optical, thermal, rheological, flame retardancy,
and mechanical properties of the base polymer.7,18,22,23,31,37

Recently, highly
dispersed polymer/LDH nanocomposites have been
prepared by the liquid exfoliation method. Wang et al. converted the
hydrophilic LDH layers to hydrophobic ones by an aqueous miscible
organic solvent treatment (AMOST) and prepared the stable dispersions
of LDH in nonpolar solvents.21,28,36,38 Subsequently, the exfoliated
LDH nanosheets were used to prepare polypropylene/LDH nanocomposites
by the solution blending method.21,28 Using this
method, it was shown that the PP nanocomposites prepared with Zn2Al-borate displayed better performance than the nanocomposites
prepared with the equivalent Mg3Al-borate.28 In another study, Wang and co-workers revealed that the
gallery anions resulted in a significant difference in the properties
of the polymer/LDH nanocomposites.37 The
synergistic effect of different LDH with the combination of an intumescent
flame-retardant additive was studied by the melt blending method,
and it was shown that the nanocomposite containing ternary LDH is
a better flame-retardant additive.39 Recently,
we have reported highly dispersed isotactic polypropylene (iPP)/LDH
nanocomposites using two different-sized (lateral size) LDH and showed
that the lateral size of the LDH has a significant influence on the
thermal stability and crystallization rate of iPP.18

Here, we prepared iPP/LDH nanocomposites filled with
three different
types of LDH (Co–Al LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al
LDH) by the solvent mixing method, particularly using the sonicated
LDH (fragmented LDH). Both LDH and iPP/LDH nanocomposites were carefully
characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). This study
aims at unraveling the influence of the intralayer metal constituents
of LDH on the crystallization rate, thermal stability, mechanical
properties, and flame retardancy of iPP nanocomposites. It was found
that iPP/LDH nanocomposites containing three-metal LDH showed better
performance in thermal stability and flame retardancy compared to
iPP/LDH nanocomposites containing two-metal LDH with the same loading.

Results
and Discussion
Characterization of LDH and Their Exfoliated
Nanosheets
Both two-metal LDH (Co–Al and Zn–Al
LDH) and three-metal
LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) were synthesized under similar conditions
by the co-precipitation method. The powder X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of LDH are displayed in Figure 1a. The sharp and symmetric features of the
X-ray reflections corresponding to the (00n) planes
suggest that the produced LDH have well-organized 2D layer stacking.
A slight difference in the peak positions of (00n) planes of different LDH may be due to the presence of either different
anions or number of water molecules within the LDH layer.37,40 Several other reflections assigned to the lattice were observed
in the 2θ range 30–70° (Figure S1). Overall, the X-ray pattern of the Co–Zn–Al
LDH was nearly identical to those of Co–Al LDH and Zn–Al
LDH in terms of peak positions and intensities. No peaks other than
the typical LDH were detected, indicating the high purity of the obtained
products. In the literature, a similar observation was made in the
X-ray patterns of Mg–Al LDH upon the substitution of Mg2+ with Co2+ to obtain the Mg–Co–Al
LDH.41Figure 1b shows the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) spectra of the various LDH studied in this work. All LDH exhibited
the characteristic bands for interlayer carbonate (CO32–) and interlayer nitrate (NO3–) at 1356 and 1382 cm–1, respectively. The conditions
favoring the formation of CO32– and NO3– were explained in our previous paper.18 The presence of IR bands at 3440 cm–1 (ν (O-H)) and 1632 cm–1 (δ (H2O)) confirmed the presence of interlayer water molecules.

XRD patterns and (b) FTIR spectra of as-prepared Co–Al
LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al LDH.

To obtain the information about the size and shape
of the as-synthesized
LDH (bulk), the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM images
were taken and are shown in Figure 2. The as-prepared LDH platelets displayed a three-dimensional
(3D) platelet-like morphology with a dark contrast, indicating the
presence of several layers of platelets in a single particle. However,
the sizes and shapes of these LDH were found to be different from
each other. The Co–Al LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al
LDH adopted different morphologies such as circular platelets, hexagonal
platelets with rounded edges, and hexagonal platelets with sharp edges,
respectively. This difference could be associated with the nucleation
and growth mechanism of LDH in different reaction environments (metal
salts) and conditions.42 The chemical compositions
of the different LDH were confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectra
(EDS) (Figure 2). The
dominant oxygen peak in EDS of different LDH indicates the presence
of water molecules within the layers as well as hydroxyl groups associated
with the layers of the as-synthesized LDH platelets.

LDH, (b) Zn–Al LDH, and (c) Co–Zn–Al LDH.

O’Hare and co-workers have
recently reported an AMOST method
for the preparation of stable dispersions of LDH in nonpolar solvents.21,28 Recently, we have reported a slightly modified method to obtain
highly delaminated sheets of LDH by sonication.18 The advantage of this sonication process is simultaneous
delamination and the lateral fragmentation of LDH. It is also worth
mentioning here that ultrasonic vibration has been extensively used
in the liquid exfoliation of 2D layered materials such as graphene,
transition metal oxides, and transition metal dichalcogenides.3,43−45 In this study, we used the same process to delaminate
the different LDH in xylene. The SEM images of different LDH (Figure S2) show the broken platelets on a large
scale, and the lateral size of LDH reduced to a few tens of nanometers.
The ultrathin sheets of LDH were directly observed by TEM, as shown
in Figure 3. It is
evident that LDH platelets are broken into small pieces and exhibit
a faint contrast compared to their bulk counterparts. Furthermore,
high-resolution TEM was used to obtain more detailed information on
the exfoliated LDH (Figure 3). These images revealed that the exfoliated LDH sheets are
fairly clean and highly crystalline. The uniform atomic orientation
and lattice spacing reveal that an individual layer consists of a
single-crystal domain. The lattice fringes with the same d-spacings of ∼0.25 nm corresponding to the (012) crystal plane
were observed in all LDH samples, and these values are consistent
with the d-spacing estimated from the XRD results.46 The EDS spectra of exfoliated LDH nanosheets
are almost comparable to those of their bulk counterparts other than
the oxygen/carbon peak intensity ratio. The intensity of the oxygen
peak decreased drastically, indicating the removal of water molecules
in the exfoliated samples. The removal of water molecules in the exfoliated
samples was further confirmed by FTIR spectra (data not shown here).

high-resolution TEM images and the corresponding energy-dispersive
spectra of exfoliated LDH nanosheets: (a) Co–Al LDH, (b) Zn–Al
LDH, and (c) Co–Zn–Al LDH.

The thickness of Co–Zn–Al LDH (both in bulk
and exfoliated
form) was evaluated by AFM. Figure 4 shows the typical AFM height images and the corresponding
height profiles of Co–Zn–Al LDH before and after exfoliation.
It is evident from Figure 4a that the as-synthesized sample shows a 3D platelet-like
morphology with lateral size ∼5 μm and thickness around
a few hundreds of nanometers. On the other hand, the exfoliated nanosheets
(Figure 4b) show that
the thickness of the fragmented LDH is less than 1.0 nm. This value
is in good agreement with the reported value for a single layer of
LDH.2,40 From these results, we may say that the
as-synthesized sample contains a few hundreds of stacked layers of
LDH. The lateral sizes of the exfoliated LDH range from 50 nm to a
few hundreds of nanometers and are consistent with the TEM results.

Synthesis and Characterization of iPP/LDH
Nanocomposites
Schematic representation of the methodology
used for the preparation
of highly dispersed iPP/LDH nanocomposites is shown in Figure 5. The as-synthesized LDH was
washed with acetone to remove interlayer H2O molecules
from the stacked LDH layers. This process helps in converting the
hydrophilic LDH to hydrophobic, and this facilitates the better dispersibility
of LDH within the iPP matrix.25,28 Subsequently, such
washed LDH was sonicated for four days in xylene. The advantage of
this step is the simultaneous surface modification and fragmentation
of the LDH. Most importantly, this method produces 2D layered materials
with lateral sizes and thickness in the nanometer range. The resultant
LDH solution was directly added to the iPP solution to obtain highly
dispersed nanocomposites. In this study, iPP nanocomposites were prepared
using three different LDH (Co–Al LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and
Co–Zn–Al LDH) by adjusting the amount of LDH to 6 wt
%. In addition to this, to understand the influence of LDH loading,
in one case, iPP/LDH nanocomposites were prepared with 10 wt % of
Co–Zn–Al LDH.

Figure 5 Schematic representation of the methodology
used for the preparation
of highly dispersed polymer nanocomposites based on iPP and LDHs.

Such prepared iPP/LDH nanocomposites
were crystallized isothermally
at 130 °C after melting at 200 °C under strictly controlled
conditions and analyzed by XRD. Figure 6a shows the XRD patterns of various nanocomposites
along with pristine iPP and Co–Zn–Al LDH. The XRD patterns
of nanocomposites are almost similar to those of pristine iPP. Both
iPP and iPP/LDH nanocomposites show reflections corresponding to the
monoclinic α form.47 At the same
time, no reflections corresponding to the (00n) planes
of LDH were observed in nanocomposites, indicating the loss of 2D
layer stacking of LDH within the iPP matrix. These results suggest
that exfoliated LDH platelets have been successfully dispersed into
the polymer matrix without much agglomeration during solution blending.
The state of LDH dispersion within the iPP matrix was further confirmed
by TEM measurements. Figure 6b shows a cross-sectional TEM image of the nanocomposite containing
10 wt % of Co–Zn–Al LDH. The nanosized LDH platelets
are homogeneously dispersed in the polymer matrix with sizes ranging
from 50 nm to a few hundreds of nanometers. This suggests that in
the solution blending method LDH platelets are successfully transformed
from solution to the solid state with minimum agglomeration.

types of LDH (for the purpose of comparison, the powder XRD pattern

LDH (10 wt %) nanocomposite.

Crystallization of iPP/LDH Nanocomposites
Tailoring
the crystallinity and crystallization rate of semicrystalline polymers
is of great importance to the polymer processing industry. The incorporation
of nanofillers in polymer matrices is known to alter the crystallization
behavior and the degree of crystallinity of the polymer matrix, which
in turn controls the physical properties of the polymers.18,48 To understand the effect of different LDH on the crystallization
rate of iPP, the melt crystallization temperature (Tmc) was measured upon cooling the polymer melt. The Tmc values have often been used to measure the
crystallization rate of the polymer. The higher the Tmc, the higher is the crystallization rate of the polymer.49Figure 7a shows differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) cooling curves
of pristine iPP and its nanocomposites at 10 °C/min. Pristine
iPP shows a Tmc at around 108 °C;
however, the Tmc values shift to 121 ±
1 °C for nanocomposites irrespective of the type of LDH. The
higher Tmc of the nanocomposites compared
to that of iPP clearly indicates the faster crystallization of iPP
in the presence of LDH; however, no change in the crystallization
rate was observed with the type of LDH used for the preparation of
nanocomposites.

Figure 7 (a) DSC cooling thermograms of pristine iPP and its nanocomposites
crystallized nonisothermally after melting at temperature 190 °C
for 1 min. (b) Crystallization isotherms obtained at 132 °C for
pristine iPP and its nanocomposites.

To further confirm the effect of different types of LDH on
the
crystallization rate of iPP, the crystallization half-time (T1/2) was obtained at an isothermal crystallization
temperature (Tc). T1/2 is usually defined as the time at which 50% of the crystallinity
is developed. Figure 7b shows the representative DSC isothermal curves of pristine iPP
and various nanocomposites crystallized at 132 °C. T1/2 of pristine iPP was 33.3 min, and it decreased significantly
for all nanocomposites irrespective of the type of LDH (T1/2 ∼ 4 ± 0.2 min). Usually, the crystallization
rate G is the reciprocal of T1/2, that is, G = 1/T1/2. Figure 8 shows the temperature dependence of 1/T1/2 for pristine iPP and nanocomposites containing different types of
LDH. It is observed that the crystallization rate decreases with increasing Tc for all of the samples, suggesting that the
overall isothermal crystallization rate decreases with increasing Tc because of the low degree of supercooling
(ΔT = Tm°
– Tc, where Tm° is the equilibrium melting temperature) at higher Tc.50 It was also
observed that the crystallization rate of nanocomposites (0.53–0.05
min–1) is higher than that of the pristine polymer
(0.17–0.01 min–1). These results suggested
that the presence of LDH enhanced the crystallization process of iPP
significantly, indicating that the fragmented LDH are effective nucleating
agents for iPP. In our previous work, detailed crystallization kinetics
has been carried out using different-sized LDH particles, and we showed
that the lateral size of the LDH particles has a significant role
in controlling the crystallization rate of iPP.18 This study revealed that the type of LDH does not affect
the crystallization rate of iPP.

rate (G = 1/T1/2) for
pristine iPP and its nanocomposites
using different types of LDH.

Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
Inorganic fillers
dispersed in a polymer matrix are known to influence the viscoelastic
properties of the polymer.51−53 The effect of the different types
of LDH particles on the dynamic mechanical performance of iPP/LDH
nanocomposites was investigated by DMA. Figure 9 shows the temperature dependence of the
storage modulus (E′) and loss tangent (tan
δ) of iPP and its nanocomposites containing different types
and amounts of LDH. Table 1 summarizes the DMA data extracted from Figure 9 for various samples. The storage modulus
of pristine iPP is 2.5 GPa at −30 °C, and it decreases
over the entire temperature range. The plateau region observed in
the temperature range of −10 to 40 °C is associated with
the relaxation of the amorphous region. The tan δ curve, which
measures the energy dissipation (damping) ability of the material,
shows peaks at 9.7 °C and another broad peak around ∼112
°C for pristine iPP. The first peak at 9.7 °C corresponds
to the glass transition temperature (Tg), and the second one is attributed to the damping within the crystalline
lamellae.51−53 Around 150 °C, a sharp decrease in the storage
modulus and a sudden increase in tan δ are due to the onset
of melting of iPP crystals.

and (b) loss factor (tan δ) measured in the heating process

On addition of 6
wt % of different types of LDH, the storage modulus
at −30 °C increased to 4.5, 4.6, and 4.65 GPa for nanocomposites
containing Co–Al LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al
LDH, respectively, which is almost 1.8-fold increment compared to
that of pristine iPP. The iPP/LDH nanocomposites exhibit a higher
storage modulus across the measured temperature range. The average
storage modulus measured at room temperature is almost two-fold higher
for nanocomposites than that of pristine iPP. Increasing the LDH content
to 10 wt % further increases the storage modulus to 6.6 and 3.2 GPa
at −30 °C and room temperature, respectively, for iPP/Co–Zn–Al
LDH nanocomposites. Generally, the increase in the storage modulus
could be due to the increase in the percent crystallinity; however,
in this present study, the percent of crystallinity (see Table 1) measured for various
samples using the WAXD data shown in Figure 6 was almost the same for pristine iPP and
iPP/LDH nanocomposites. Moreover, it is clearly observed that the
increase in the LDH content increases the storage modulus of iPP.
On the basis of these observations, the increase in the storage modulus
could be attributed to the reinforcing effect of LDH, that is, the
homogeneous dispersion of LDH within the polymer matrix without agglomerates.
It has to be noted that a little or no difference in the storage modulus
was observed with the type of LDH chosen (6 wt % loading) for the
preparation of nanocomposites. The addition of LDH caused no change
in the peak position of the tan δ curve near 9.5 °C, indicating
that Tg of iPP did not change in the presence
of the LDH particles. It is worth mentioning here that the Tg value of iPP is in the range −10 to
10 °C, depending on the grade and molecular weight.51,54−56 However, the height of the tan δ peak decreases
with the addition of LDH, which indicates the good wettability between
the LDH and iPP.51 In a few reports, it
has been reported that Tg of the polymer
was reduced, where the organically modified fillers were used for
the preparation of nanocomposites due to the plasticization effect.57 In some other cases, Tg of the polymer was increased due to the restricted mobility
of the polymer chains in the presence of fillers.51 However, in the present study, no change in Tg of iPP was observed in the presence of surfactant-free
LDH particles. The magnitude of the broad peak around ∼112
°C, which was attributed to the damping within the crystalline
lamellae, decreased for the nanocomposites. In nanocomposites, the
LDH particles are expected to accumulate within the amorphous region
of the polymer matrix. These particles influence the relaxation of
iPP chains within the crystalline lamellae and crystalline–amorphous
interfaces.

Flammability and Thermal Properties
Microscale combustion
calorimetry (MCC) is a relatively new technique used for the evaluation
of flammability of materials using small quantities of the sample,
and this works on the principle of oxygen combustion. This technique
was successfully used as a preliminary test for the evaluation of
flame-retardant properties of polymer/LDH nanocomposites.19,29−31 The heat release rate (HRR) is considered to be the
most important parameter to estimate the flammability behavior of
the polymer materials. Figure 10 presents the HRR plots for pristine iPP and its nanocomposites
using different types and quantities of LDH. Several parameters such
as the specific HRR, heat release capacity (HRC), and total heat release
(THR) are summarized in Table 2 along with the 50% degradation temperature estimated from
thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Unlike the crystallization rate
and storage modulus, the nanocomposites containing different types
of LDH showed different HRR values. For pristine iPP, the HRR value
is around 1435 W/g. With the addition of 6 wt % of different types
of LDH, the HRR values were reduced to 1080, 990, and 880 W/g for
Co–Al LDH, Zn–Al LDH, and Co–Zn–Al LDH,
respectively. These results clearly suggested that different LDH have
different flame-retardant efficiencies. Three-metal LDH showed 38%
reduction in the HRR value, which is better than that of the other
two-metal LDH with the same LDH loadings. Matusinovic et al. showed
that the dispersion of LDH in the polymer matrix is one of the key
parameters in achieving good flame retardancy.58 As discussed in the preceding section, highly dispersed
nanocomposites were obtained using all types of LDH, so the dispersion
of LDH may not be the key reason for the difference in the flame-retardant
behavior. It was also demonstrated that different gallery anions have
different flame-retardant efficiencies.29,59,60 However, in the present study, the different LDH
used have the same anions (both CO32– and NO3–) because of the same protocol
used for the synthesis of different LDH. It has been shown that the
char formation can slow the HRR upon the ignition of polymers, and
it can inhibit the flame spreading.22,39,61,62 To understand the difference
in the flame-retardant efficiency of different LDH, the amount of
char formed upon the degradation of the polymer matrix was analyzed
by TGA. Figure 11a
shows the TGA thermograms of pristine iPP and its nanocomposites containing
6 wt % of different types of LDH. The thermal stability of the polymer
is discussed in a later section. As seen from Figure 11a, the pristine polymer shows almost no
char, whereas the samples containing different types of LDH show different
char amounts ranging from 4.1 to 4.6 wt %. To further understand the
reason for the difference in the char yield, TGA thermograms of different
LDH were taken and are shown in Figure 11b. By considering the char yields of different
LDH, the expected char residues were estimated for the nanocomposites
prepared using different types of LDH and are shown in Table S1. It is quite clear that different LDH
give different char yields, which follow the order Co–Zn–Al
LDH > Zn–Al LDH > Co–Al LDH. Similar to char yields,
the HRR also follows the same order. On the basis of these results,
the lowest HRR value of the nanocomposite prepared using three-metal
LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) can probably be attributed to the
better char formation of three-metal LDH, which reduces the heat and
mass transfer between the gas and condensed phases. It is worth mentioning
here that LDH acts like both endothermic flame retardant and char
forming flame retardant.62 Under fire conditions,
the LDH filler endothermically decomposes into water, carbon dioxide,
metal hydroxides, and other gases, depending on the gallery anions.
Furthermore, the decomposition products of the LDH are nonflammable,
and so the residue left behind by the thermal decomposition (usually
a metal oxide) dilutes the total amount of polymer fuel availability
(condensed phase).22 This process promotes
the formation of char and protects the bulk polymer exposure to air.
This char helps in reducing the HRR during the combustion and suppresses
the smoke production. From the TGA results of LDH, it is clear that
the char formation is effective in three-metal LDH compared to that
of two-metal LDH.

To further verify the effect of LDH
loading, 10 wt % of Co–Zn–Al
LDH was added to iPP, and it was observed that the HRR value was further
reduced by 55%. Wang and co-workers showed the reduction in the HRR
value by 54% using 4 times higher LDH loadings (i.e., 40 wt %) in
high-density polyethylene/LDH nanocomposites using MCC.29 The HRC values estimated from the HRR curve
(see Table 2) also
show a similar trend like the HRR values, indicating that the three-metal
LDH are efficient flame-retardant fillers compared to the two-metal
LDH.

The THR calculated from the area under the HRR curve is
an important
parameter to understand the fire hazards of the material.29,30 It has been shown that for an efficient flame-retardant filler,
the THR value should reduce effectively when it is incorporated into
the polymer.29,30 It is obvious from Table 2 that the THR value is considerably
reduced with the addition of 6 wt % of LDH and further reduced with
increasing LDH loading to 10 wt %. A small difference in the THR values
was observed with the type of LDH used for the preparation of nanocomposites.
Three-metal LDH showed a lower THR value compared to that of the other
two-metal LDH, indicating that the three-metal LDH is a better flame-retardant
nanofiller for iPP.

The relative thermal stability of iPP was
evaluated in the presence
of different types of LDH. The 50% weight loss temperatures (T0.5) measured for various samples from Figure 11a are summarized
in Table 2. It can
be seen that pristine iPP degraded completely with T0.5 at 410 °C. The thermal decomposition temperature
of iPP containing different types of LDH shifted to higher temperatures
compared to pristine iPP. However, significant differences are seen
in the thermal stability of nanocomposites containing different types
of LDH. The T0.5 values of iPP containing
Co–Al LDH (6 wt %), Zn–Al LDH (6 wt %), and Co–Zn–Al
LDH (6 wt %) increased to 420, 430, and 443 °C, respectively.
It has been shown that the enhanced thermal stability is due to the
homogeneous dispersion of the nanosized LDH in the iPP matrix, where
the dispersed nanoparticles act as trapping sites for the radicals
generated during the degradation of the polymer.18,21,23 However, in the present study, the dispersion
of the LDH particles in the iPP matrix is more or less the same in
different nanocomposites. One of the possibilities for the difference
in the degradation temperature is the catalytic ability of the metal
constituents used for the preparation of LDH. Typically, cobalt is
known for the catalytic degradation of polyolefins.63 However, in the present study, the cobalt containing three-metal
LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) showed better thermal stability than
the other two LDH. On the basis of the present results, we speculate
that the difference in the thermal stability of iPP containing different
types of LDH might be due to the thermally stable char formed by the
degradation of LDH, which prevents further degradation of iPP. As
mentioned in the preceding section, the char formation in different
LDH follows the order Co–Zn–Al LDH > Zn–Al
LDH
> Co–Al LDH. Similar to this, the thermal stability and
flame
retardancy of the nanocomposites also follow the same order. On the
other hand, the nanocomposite with 10 wt % of Co–Zn–Al
LDH shows a T0.5 value of ∼435
°C, which is less than the T0.5 value
of the nanocomposite containing 6 wt % of Co–Zn–Al LDH.
This might be due to the agglomeration of LDH in higher loadings.
Similar kinds of observations were reported in the literature.18,23,28 It was shown that 2.5 wt % of
sonicated LDH was the optimal loading for the effective thermal stability
of iPP due to its better dispersion in the iPP matrix.18 In this way, the intralayer metal constituents
of LDH play an important role in determining the properties of the
nanocomposites.

Conclusions
Two-metal LDH and three-metal
LDH were successfully synthesized
by the co-precipitation method and delaminated by ultrasonication
in xylene. The sonication step resulted in both delamination and fragmentation
of LDH. TEM and AFM analysis confirmed the delamination of LDH. Subsequently,
highly dispersed iPP/LDH nanocomposites were prepared by the solution
blending method. The dispersion of LDH within the iPP matrix was further
confirmed by TEM and WAXD. We have found that the incorporation of
either two-metal LDH or three-metal LDH dramatically improves the
crystallization rate and storage modulus of iPP. However, not much
difference is observed in these properties with the type of LDH used
for the preparation of nanocomposites. On the other hand, the kind
of LDH could influence the thermal stability and flame-retardant properties
of iPP. Keeping the filler loading at 6 wt %, the 50% weight loss
temperature (T0.5) of the iPP nanocomposite
containing three-metal LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) is higher
than that of the corresponding nanocomposites prepared using the two-metal
LDH (Co–Al LDH and Zn–Al LDH). Preliminary data on the
flame-retardant properties showed better reduction in the HRR value
compared to that of two-metal LDH containing nanocomposites. These
differences might be due to the better char formation capability of
three-metal LDH compared to that of two-metal LDH. These results demonstrated
that the proper selection of metal constituents of LDH is imperative
in the preparation of polymer/LDH nanocomposites with desirable properties.

Experimental
Section
Materials
iPP pellets (Mw 120 000, Mw/Mn 4.5) were kindly supplied by Sumitomo Chemicals Co.
Ltd., Japan. Metal salts such as Al(NO3)3·9H2O, Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and Zn(NO3)2·6H2O were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co.
Ltd. Other chemicals such as urea, xylene, ethanol, and acetone were
obtained from Merck, India.

Synthesis of LDH
Different types
of LDH used in this
study were synthesized by a conventional co-precipitation method using
urea as the base. Three-metal LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH) was
prepared by dissolving three metal salts (Co(NO3)2·6H2O, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O, and Al(NO3)3·9H2O), and urea in Millipore water
with a ratio of 1:1:1:7. The total mixture was then heated to the
refluxing temperature (about 100 °C) under continuous stirring
for 24 h in an ambient atmospheric environment. The resultant light
pink color precipitate was rapidly quenched in cold water and filtered,
and then the precipitate was repeatedly washed with hot Millipore
water to remove the unreacted reactants if any. The thus-obtained
LDH powder was repeatedly washed with acetone. The end product was
dispersed in xylene and sonicated for 4 days in an ultrasonication
bath at room temperature. The resulting suspension was stable at room
temperature for a few hours. Two-metal LDH (Co–Al LDH and Zn–Al
LDH) were synthesized in the same way, with the exception that the
Co2+ and Al3+, Zn2+ and Al3+ metal nitrates were taken in 2:1 ratio.

Preparation of iPP/LDH
Nanocomposites
Three different
LDH (Co–Zn–Al LDH, Co–Al LDH, and Zn–Al
LDH) were used as reinforcement fillers for the preparation of iPP
nanocomposites. The synthetic procedure is as follows: for example,
to prepare 6 wt % of iPP/LDH nanocomposite, 0.06 g of LDH powder was
dispersed in 150 mL of xylene in an ultrasonic bath for four days
at 45 °C to yield a uniform suspension. Then, 0.94 g of iPP was
dissolved in the suspension and the sonication was continued for 10
min. The resultant solution was refluxed at 150 °C with continuous
magnetic stirring for 24 h under an argon atmosphere. Finally, the
polymer solution was reprecipitated out in ethanol. The precipitate
was filtrated, washed with ethanol, and vacuum dried at 100 °C
for 24 h. The type and amount of LDH were adjusted to prepare different
nanocomposites with various LDH loadings (0, 6, and 10%). The actual
loading of the LDH in iPP was estimated using TGA and the details
are given in Table S1.

Characterization
WAXD
XEUSS 2D SAXS/WAXS system with a Genix microsource
from Xenocs was used for the WAXD measurements. The X-ray system was
operated at 50 kV and 0.6 mA. The Cu Kα radiation (λ =
1.54 Å) was collimated with a FOX2D mirror and two pairs of scatterless
slits. The measurements were carried out in the transmission geometry.
The fiber diagrams were recorded on a Mar345 image plate and processed
using the Fit2D software. The sample to the detector distance was
214.5 mm. Samples were crystallized under controlled conditions using
a differential scanning calorimeter, and the prepared samples were
used for the XRD measurements.

FTIR
A Perkin
Elmer Series FTIR spectrum-2 was used
to measure the infrared spectrum over the wavenumber range 4000–400
cm–1. The dried LDH powder was mixed with KBr and
pressed in the form of pellets for FTIR measurements. The spectra
were collected with 32 scans and a resolution of 1 cm–1.

SEM
The shape and size of the LDH were investigated
by SEM (Zeiss EVO 18 cryo-SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 20
kV. LDH suspension was directly drop-cast onto a carbon-coated grid
and imaged after natural drying at room temperature. Before imaging,
a thin layer of gold was evaporated onto the sample to avoid charging
and to improve contrast.

TEM
A JEOL 2010 transmission electron
microscope operating
at 300 kV was used to investigate the LDH morphology. LDH suspension
was directly drop-cast on a carbon-coated copper grid and allowed
for natural drying for two days in a dust-free environment. The prepared
samples were then used for both imaging and elemental composition
analysis using an energy-dispersive spectrometer (Technai G2 30LaB6, ST with EDS). To view the dispersion of LDH in
the polymer matrix, ultrathin sections of the nanocomposite samples
(∼ 60 nm thickness) were sliced with a diamond knife (35°
knife angle; DIATOME, Switzerland) using ultramicrotome EM UC/FC 6,
Leica (Austria) at −140 °C. The sections were floated
with a dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixture on a carbon-filmed TEM copper
grid. These thin slices of the samples were analyzed using a TEM LIBRA
120, Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH (Oberkochen, Germany), with an acceleration
voltage of 120 kV.

AFM
The surface morphology and thickness
of the LDH
sheets were analyzed using a Bruker Multimode atomic force microscope,
Germany, in the tapping mode. The as-synthesized LDH in water and
the sonicated LDH suspension in xylene were coated on silicon wafers.

TGA
TGA thermograms were collected in the heating process
at 10 °C/min using TA Q50. All measurements were carried out
under a nitrogen atmosphere (nitrogen gas flow rate of 60 mL/min for
the furnace and 40 mL/min for the balance).

DSC
DSC measurements
were performed on a Perkin Elmer
Pyris 6 DSC apparatus under nitrogen gas flow. The temperature and
heat flow were calibrated using high-purity indium. The crystallization
half-time (T1/2) was measured to evaluate
the crystallization rate of iPP and its nanocomposites. Molten samples
were rapidly cooled to the desired crystallization temperature (Tc) (132 °C) at a rate of 100 °C/min,
and the samples were allowed to crystallize at that temperature. These
samples were reheated to 190 °C to measure the melting temperature.

MCC
The MCC-1 (FTT) was used as a preliminary test
to evaluate the combustion behavior of iPP and iPP/LDH nanocomposites.
In the MCC system, approximately 5 mg of the sample was heated to
700 °C at a heating rate of 1 °C/s in a stream of N2 flow at 80 cm3/min. The resulting volatile anaerobic
thermal degradation products in the nitrogen gas stream are mixed
with 80 cm3/min carrying gas (nitrogen of 80 mL/min; oxygen
of 20 mL/min) and subsequently burned at 900 °C in a combustion
furnace. The flame-retardant parameters were measured from this test,
and are the HRR in W/g, % of reduction in HRR, THR rate in KJ/g, temperature
maxima (T-max) in °C, and
HRC in J/g K.

DMA
DMA (TA Instruments Model Q800)
was used to study
the temperature-dependent dynamic mechanical properties of the samples.
The samples with dimensions 25 × 6 × 0.4 mm3 were
prepared using the hot press. All samples were annealed at 130 °C
for 5 h. The prepared samples were used to measure the temperature-dependent
storage modulus (E′), loss modulus (E″), and their ratio (tan δ) at a constant
frequency (ω) of 6.28 rad/s with a strain amplitude of 0.05%.
The measurements were carried out in a temperature range of −50
to 160 °C, with a heating rate of 2 °C/min.
