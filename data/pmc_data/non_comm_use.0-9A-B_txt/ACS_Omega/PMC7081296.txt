We report the preparation and application
of a heterostructured
photoelectrocatalyst comprising carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) and boron
codoped BiVO4 and WO3 for the removal of an
organic dye pollutant in water. The materials, synthesized by hydrothermal
method, were characterized by X-ray diffraction, diffuse reflectance
UV–visible spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy,
and electron microscopy. The catalysts were immobilized on treated
titanium sheets by drop-casting. The fabricated electrodes were characterized
by linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and chronoamperometry. Diffuse reflectance
spectroscopy of the catalysts reveals that the incorporation of CNPs
and B into the structure of monoclinic BiVO4 enhanced its
optical absorption in both UV and visible regions. The LSV measurements
carried out in 0.1 M Na2SO4 showed that the
BiVO4- and WO3-based photoelectrode demonstrated
significant photoactivity. CNP/B-BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 photoanodes gave photocurrent densities of approximately
0.83 and 1.79 mA/cm2, respectively, at 1.2 V (vs 3 M Ag/AgCl).
The performance of the electrodes toward degradation of orange II
dye was in the order BiVO4 < B-BiVO4 <
WO3 < CNP-BiVO4 < CNP/B-BiVO4 < CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3, and the apparent rate
constants obtained by fitting the experimental data into the Langmuir
Hinshelwood kinetic model are 0.0924, 0.1812, 0.254, and 0.845 h–1 for BiVO4, WO3, CNP/B-BiVO4, and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3, respectively.
The chemical oxygen demand abatement after 3 h of electrolysis at
the best performing photoanode was 58%. The study showed that BiVO4 and WO3 are promising anodic materials for photoelectrocatalytic
water treatment plant.

1 Introduction
Photoelectrocatalytic
(PEC) process has been indicated to hold
promise for wastewater remediation and energy conversion.1 In this technique, electrical energy is applied
to a photocatalytic system to obtain synergistic benefit. In the last
few years, combining electrochemical process and photocatalysis has
been shown to yield improved performance for organic pollutant degradation
compared to either electro-oxidation or photocatalysis alone. This
enhanced performance has been attributed to the ability of the applied
bias potential to promote the separation of the photogenerated hole
and electron pairs.2−4

Photocatalysts that are sensitive in the visible
region of the
solar spectrum have received considerable attention as anodic materials
for PEC5−7 because utilizing sunlight for the process promotes
sustainability. For instance, BiVO4 and its composites
have been used as photoanodes in the PEC system for hydrogen production
via water splitting and organic contaminant decomposition.8−12 Having a narrow band gap of 2.4 eV, BiVO4 is an ideal
semiconductor for visible-light-driven processes. It is nontoxic,
stable to photocorrosion, inexpensive, and can be obtained via simple
synthetic routes.13 However, apart from
the rapid recombination of electron–hole pairs,14 BiVO4 also suffers from poor electrical
conductivity and low adsorptive performance.15 These drawbacks make BiVO4 an inefficient photocatalyst
for pollutant degradation. Studies have shown that the photocatalytic/PEC
degradation of organic pollutants at pristine BiVO4 presented
low removal efficiency.16−19

WO3 (band gap, 2.5–2.8 eV)
is another promising
material for PEC. It is inexpensive, demonstrates low susceptibility
to photocorrosion, exhibits appreciable stability in acidic and oxidative
conditions, and nontoxic.20−22 Importantly, WO3 is
being explored as a potential photocatalyst for destruction of organic
pollutants because of the high oxidation power of its valence-bound
holes.23 In spite of its impressive properties,
the photocatalytic activity of WO3 is poor owing to its
relatively low conduction band edge. The position of the conduction
band edge is unfavorable for one-electron reduction of adsorbed oxygen
molecules.24 This leads to accumulation
of photogenerated electrons and their consequent recombination with
the holes which are needed for oxidation of target compounds. As a
result, improving the photocatalytic activity of WO3 by
modifying its electronic structure has been the focus of many studies.
It has been reported that tuning the morphology/structure of WO3 can yield a catalyst with enhanced charge separation and
improved photoactivity.20,25−28 Theerthagiri et al., Zhang et al., and Yao et al., in separate studies,
showed that WO3 nanorods possess suitable physicochemical
properties for enhanced photocatalytic performance.29−31

Fabricating
a hybrid of two or more semiconductors has been hinted
as one of the plausible approaches to overcome the challenges of electron
and hole recombination.32−36 Similarly, some other limitations associated with individual photocatalyst
such as the low conduction band edge in WO3 and the poor
charge mobility in BiVO4 can also be circumvented by this
approach.3 The resulting nanocomposite
catalysts have been reported to display much higher activity than
the individual materials. Xia et al. reported the oxidation of phenol
on a Fe2O3/BiVO4 thin film anode
via PEC process.37 The composite photoanode
demonstrated superior performance to the pristine BiVO4 anode. The authors attributed the enhanced degradation performance
to the ultrathin iron oxide, which minimized charge carrier recombination
in BiVO4. In another report by Martins et al.,38 WO3-modified TiO2 nanotube
array (NTA) exhibited better mineralization efficiency than the unmodified
TiO2 (NTAs) when both electrodes were employed for the
PEC degradation of the endocrine-disrupting compound propyl paraben.
Similarly, Wei et al.39 reported that decontamination
of coking wastewater containing phenolic compounds was much more efficient
at heterostructured TiO2/g-C3N4 than
at pure TiO2 and g-C3N4. The improvement
in the PEC efficiency was attributed partly to the heterojunction
that is formed between the two photocatalysts which suppresses the
recombination rate of electrons and holes.

In this work, BiVO4 has been modified with carbon nanoparticles
(CNPs) and boron to obtain a photocatalyst denoted as CNP/B-BiVO4. This catalyst was then coupled to WO3 nanorods
and the resulting nanocomposite was immobilized on Ti plate. The photoanode,
CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3, was then employed for the catalytic
oxidation of orange II dye. A few studies have reported the use of
BiVO4/WO3 as anodic material in PEC experiments.32,40,41 In this study, we hypothesized
that modification of BiVO4 with substances such as CNP
and B would impact positively on the photocatalytic performance of
the semiconductor. In addition, we envisaged that coupling this modified
material to WO3 nanorods will provide a nanocomposite anode
with desirable properties for PEC applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 XRD Analyses
The
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of the electrode materials are shown in Figure 1. The diffraction peaks in
the XRD pattern of pure BiVO4 (Figure 1) can be indexed to monoclinic scheelite
structure of BiVO4 (JCPDS card no. 14-0688).42,43 The XRD pattern of CNPs and B codoped BiVO4 shows an
additional peak at 24°, which can be ascribed to the (002) plane
of graphite.

Figure 1 Powder XRD patterns of (a) BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4 and (b) WO3.

The XRD pattern of WO3 (Figure 1b) shows diffraction peaks at 2θ =
14.1, 22.9, 28.2, 36.5, 49.9, and 55.4°, which correspond to
the (100), (001), (200), (201), (220), and (221) crystal planes, respectively,
of the hexagonal structure of WO3 (JCPDS card no. 75-2187).44,45

2.2 Morphology Investigations, EDS Analysis, and
Elemental Mapping
The scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (EDS) spectra, and elemental maps are presented in Figures 2 and 3. From the SEM image of pristine BiVO4 (Figure 2a), it can be observed
that the sizes of the nanoparticles formed are largely uniform. The
particles seem to be closely packed. The SEM image of the doped BiVO4 (Figure 2b)
shows a morphological characteristic of a composite material. It shows
some plate-like structures with embedded particles and the constituents
seem to be well integrated. The electron images show that the dimensions
of the materials are much less than 100 nm. The elemental map (Figure 2c) confirms the presence
of B in the nanocomposite, with the element uniformly distributed
within the material. Similarly, Figure 2d reveals that carbon particles are present in the
nanocomposite material. The EDS spectrum (Figure 2e) further confirms the presence of B, although
it has a very low intensity owing to its very low concentration compared
with the other elements in the composite material.

The TEM images of the synthesized WO3 nanorods are shown
in Figure 3a.b. The
image at 1 μm (Figure 3a) reveals that the rods are of different lengths, but the
diameter seems to be essentially the same. The TEM image of the carbon
particles is presented in Figure 3c, where the particles appear to be spherical and agglomerated.

2.3 BET Surface Area Analysis
Nitrogen
adsorption–desorption experiment was performed to investigate
the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area of the
pristine and composite materials. The adsorption isotherms of BiVO4, CNP, CNP/B-BiVO4, and WO3 are given
in Figure 4, and the
specific BET surface areas are presented in Table 1. From the values in the table, it is obvious
that incorporation of CNP into the lattices of BiVO4 resulted
in an increase in the surface area of the photocatalyst. Higher surface
area is beneficial for interaction between the organic pollutant and
the photoelectrocatalyst, and this will aid overall degradation efficiency.
Similarly, the comparatively high BET surface area of WO3 nanorods will contribute significantly to the adsorption capability
of the heterojunction photoanode, which will enhance its catalytic
performance.

BiVO4, (b) CNP, (c) CNP/B-BiVO4, and (d) WO3.

2.4 Diffuse
Reflectance Spectroscopy
Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
(DRS) is a valuable technique that
can be used to gain insights into the electronic states of semiconducting
materials. The UV–vis absorption spectra of BiVO4, WO3, and CNP/B-BiVO4 are shown in Figure 5. The intrinsic absorption
bands of both the pristine BiVO4 and doped BiVO4 span over the UV and visible light regions, while that of WO3 seem to be strong within the UV region, extending slightly
into the visible region. This absorption characteristic of WO3 is in agreement with earlier reports.46,47 The doped BiVO4 demonstrates superior visible light absorption
compared to the pristine BiVO4. In addition, the absorption
edge of the CNP and B codoped BiVO4 exhibits a red shift.
The extension of the absorption edge of the doped material may be
as a result of band transitions occurring because of the presence
of impurities in the forbidden band.48 The
band gap energies of the catalysts (Figure 6) were estimated from a plot of (F(R) × hν)1/2 against hν, where F(R) is the Kubelka–Munk function given by
(1 – R)2/2 × R (R is reflectance), and hν
is the incident photon energy.49,50

function vs incident energy.

2.5 Linear Sweep Voltammetry and Photocurrent
Response
The linear sweep voltammograms of the fabricated
photoanodes were obtained in the dark and in the presence of light.
As shown in Figure 7a, the current responses of both CNP/B-BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 in the dark are not significantly different
until reaching a potential of about 1.0 V, with the CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 electrode displaying a slightly higher current
than the codoped BiVO4 electrode (0.16 and 0.15 mA/cm2 at 1.3 V). Apparently, the presence of WO3 contributed
to the current signal of the CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 electrode. It is well known that WO3 exhibits better
charge-transfer property than BiVO4.51,52 In addition, in both doped BiVO4 and heterostructured
electrodes, photocurrent seems to increase as the anodic potential
increases. In the presence of light, the photoanodes showed markedly
higher photocurrents (1.25 and 2.20 mA/cm2 at 1.3 V for
CNP/B-BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3,
respectively) than those recorded under dark condition (Figure 6b). The significant photocurrent
enhancement recorded by the coupled semiconductor anode can be attributed
to the contributions from both BiVO4 and WO3 (Figure 7b). The
excellent charge transport property of WO3 and the high
visible light activity of BiVO4 are beneficial for improved
photoactivity. As evident in Figure 7b, the photocurrent responses at both CNP/B-BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 are stable over
the time range shown.

Figure 7 (a) Linear sweep voltammograms of photoanodes measured
in 0.1 M
Na2SO4 and (b) photocurrent response of CNP/B-BiVO4 and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 obtained in 5 mg
L–1 of orange II dye (prepared in 0.1 M Na2SO4) at a potential of 1.2 V.

2.6 PEC Degradation Experiments
Degradation
of orange II sodium salt was carried out at the fabricated electrodes
to evaluate their PEC performance. The oxidation process was performed
at an applied anodic potential of 2.0 V. The removal efficiency of
the dye was calculated from the following relation:  where A0 and At are the absorbance
values
at time t = 0 and t = t, respectively.

As can be seen in Figure 8a, the CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 electrode exhibited the highest degradation efficiency with 92%
removal of the dye in 3 h of the PEC process. The performance of the
photoanodes follows the order BiVO4 < B-BiVO4 < WO3 < CNP–BiVO4 < CNP/B-BiVO4 < CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3. Degradation efficiency
at B-doped BiVO4 photoanode is only slightly higher than
that obtained at the pristine BiVO4 anode (data not shown).
Wang et al. made similar observation in the photocatalytic performance
of BiVO4 and B-BiVO4.53 The authors reported that boron doping narrows the band gap energy
of the photocatalyst by a magnitude of 0.04 eV, thus increasing its
light absorption in the visible region. It was also suggested that
interstitial boron doping can increase the number of oxygen vacancies
and V4+, leading to red shifting of the absorption edge
and consequently improved photocatalytic performance in the visible
light region. It is noteworthy that the performance of pristine BiVO4 is inferior to that of the pure WO3 nanorods despite
the former being a better absorber of visible light. The poor conductivity
and low adsorption capability of BiVO4 are some of the
factors responsible for its low PEC performance. On the other hand,
the relatively large surface area of WO3 and its excellent
conductivity are favorable for the degradation of organic pollutants.
However, incorporation of CNP into BiVO4 leads to significant
improvement in its PEC performance. In essence, the CNP and B codoped
BiVO4 showed much more enhanced performance. Also, incorporation
of CNP into the structure of BiVO4 could lead to improved
charge transport property and enhanced adsorption capability of the
photocatalyst. Apparently, the CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3 performed best because of the contributions of the various constituent
materials. The kinetic rate constants obtained by fitting the degradation
experimental data into the Langmuir Hinshelwood kinetic model are
0.0924, 0.1812, 0.254, and 0.845 h–1 for BiVO4, WO3, CNP/B-BiVO4, and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3, respectively. Figure 8b displays the plots of normalized concentration
abatement of the dye via photolysis, electrolysis, and photoelectrocatalysis.
It can be seen that the coupled process offers a far more efficient
removal of the dye than the individual processes. This observation
further affirms the superiority of PEC oxidation process to both electrochemical
oxidation and photocatalytic oxidation processes. The chemical oxygen
demand (COD) decay after 3 h of the PEC process at the preferred anode
was 58%. For possible practical application, the photoelectrocatalyst
(CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3) was further employed for the
degradation of 50 mg L–1 (50 mL) of the dye solution
under the same experimental conditions. A 56% decolourization was
obtained after 3 h of the process.

salt (a) at different
photoanodes (b) by different oxidation processes.

3 Conclusions
Two visible-light-sensitive semiconductors,
namely, BiVO4 and WO3, have been synthesized,
characterized, and applied
for the degradation of a model organic pollutant, orange II dye. BiVO4 was modified with CNP and B to improve its charge transport
property and adsorption behavior to increase its PEC efficiency. The
kinetic rate constants calculated for the degradation of the contaminants
at BiVO4 and WO3 photoanodes were 0.0924 and
0.1812 h–1, respectively. The much better performance
of WO3 nanorods compared to the undoped BiVO4 may not be unrelated to its morphology, which can retard recombination
of photogenerated electron–hole pairs. Doping CNP and B into
the structure of BiVO4 led to significant improvement in
its PEC performance. Coupling the doped BiVO4 to WO3 yielded a heterostructured anodic material which showed much
more excellent properties than the individual components. The higher
performance of this electrode can be linked to the formation of n–n
heterojunction, which promotes separation of charges and generation
of a large amount of the valence-bound holes, which are needed for
the oxidation of the pollutant. This study shows that BiVO4- and WO3-based anodes have prospects for water remediation
via photoelectrocatalysis.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Sodium tungstate dihydrate
(Na2WO4·2H2O), bismuth nitrate
pentahydrate (Bi(NO3)3·5H2O),
sodium metavanadate (NaVO3), sodium chloride (NaCl), sodium
sulfate (Na2SO4), sodium hydrogen carbonate
(NaHCO3), sodium hydroxide (NaOH), orange II sodium salt,
polyethylene glycol (PEG), boric acid (H3BO3), and ethanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, South Africa. All
solutions were prepared with deionized water.

4.2 Synthesis
of WO3 Nanorods
The synthesis of WO3 nanorods is as follows: 2.62 g of
Na2WO4·2H2O was dissolved in
80 mL of deionized water, followed by addition of 1.0 g of NaCl. The
homogeneous mixture obtained was then acidified with HCl until the
pH was 2.06. Upon addition of HCl, the mixture turned to a white precipitate,
and this precursor solution was transferred to a 100 mL Teflon-lined
autoclave. The autoclave was sealed and maintained at 180 °C
in an oven for 24 h. After cooling to room temperature, the synthesized
material was transferred into centrifuge tubes and washed by centrifugation
repeatedly with deionized water and then ethanol. The material was
then dried at 80 °C in an air oven for 8 h. The powder material
obtained after drying was kept for use.

4.3 Preparation
of CNPs, BiVO4, and
CNP/B-BiVO4
CNPs were prepared from oats purchased
from a local market in Johannesburg, South Africa. Oats (5 g) was
powdered by grinding. The powder was then put into a crucible and
transferred into a muffle furnace maintained at 400 °C for 2
h. The black material formed was allowed to cool to room temperature,
pulverized, and subsequently dispersed in deionized water. The dispersion
was centrifuged and the supernatant was decanted into a clean beaker.
This process was repeated several times to obtain more supernatants.
The water in the supernatant was evaporated and the solid particles
left in the beaker were collected and kept for use.

To synthesize
pristine BiVO4, 0.61 g of NaVO3 was dissolved
in about 40 mL of deionized water and 2.43 g of Bi(NO3)3·5H2O were dissolved in 0.1 M HNO3. The NaVO3 solution was then gradually added to the Bi(NO3)3 solution. The yellow precursor solution formed
was transferred into a Teflon-lined autoclave, sealed, and put into
the stainless steel shell. This was then maintained 180 °C for
24 h in an oven. Upon cooling, the material was transferred into centrifuge
tubes and washed a few times with water. The yellow substance obtained
after decantation was dried in an air oven at 80 °C for 8 h.
Preparation of CNP/B-BiVO4 followed the same procedure
except that 1.0 g of H3BO3 and 10 mg of CNP
were added to the solution of NaVO3 prior to mixing with
Bi(NO3)3·5H2O solution.

4.4 Characterization of the Materials
Powder XRD analysis
of the catalysts was done on a Rigaku Smartlab
X-ray diffractometer (USA) equipped with Cu kα radiation and
operated at 40 kV and 40 mA. The electron images were obtained on
a scanning electron microscope (TESCAN, VEGA3 XMU, Czech Republic)
and transmission electron microscope (JEOL 2100 HRTEM 200V, Japan).
Energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry analysis was performed on the
equipment attached to the scanning electron microscope. DRS was done
on a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Shimadzu 2450, Japan), and
concentration abatement of the dye was monitored on a UV–visible
spectrophotometer (Agilent Cary 60, Malaysia) at its wavelength of
maximum absorption. COD was determined on a HACH DR3900 spectrophotometer.

4.5 Fabrication of Electrodes
Ti sheets
were first degreased in 40% m/m NaOH solution heated to 80 °C
and maintained for 2 h. Etching of the sheets was then carried out
in a 18% v/v HCl solution maintained at 98% for 2 h.

The dispersions
of BiVO4, B-BiVO4, CNP/BiVO4, CNP/B-BiVO4, and WO3 were prepared by weighing 0.2 g of each
of the catalysts into an ethanolic solution of PEG (containing 2 mL
of ethanol and 1 mL of PEG). A mixture of both CNP/B-BiVO4 and WO3 was also prepared by dispersing 0.1 g of each
of the catalysts in an ethanolic solution of PEG. The dispersions
were ultrasonicated for 60 min.

The dispersion (100 μL)
was drop-cast onto both sides of
the prepared Ti sheets with an exposed area of 4 cm2. The
coated sheets were dried in an air oven at a temperature of 250 °C.
The coating was repeated once more and the sheets were sintered at
500 °C in a muffle furnace.

4.6 Electrochemical
Experiments
Electrochemical
measurements were done on a computer-controlled potentiostat (Autolab
PGSTAT 302N) using a three-electrode system. The working electrodes
used include BiVO4/Ti, B-BiVO4/Ti, CNP–BiVO4/Ti, CNP/B-BiVO4/Ti, WO3/Ti, and CNP/B-BiVO4/WO3/Ti, the reference electrode was Ag/AgCl (3
M KCl), and the counter electrode was a coiled platinum wire. Linear
sweep voltammetric measurements were carried out in a 0.1 M solution
of Na2SO4, and amperometric measurements in
the presence and absence of photons were performed in 5 mg L–1 solution of orange II sodium salt (prepared in 0.1 M Na2SO4). Electrochemical oxidation of the dye was carried
out in a quartz photoelectrochemical cell in the presence and absence
of light. Typically, 250 mL of the simulated wastewater (containing
5 mg L–1 of the analyte) was electrolyzed in an
experiment with continuous stirring of the electrolytic solution.
The solar light source was an Oriel solar simulator. The simulator
has a xenon lamp of 100 W and a UV cutoff filter (Air Mass 1.5 Global
filter), giving 1.0 sun output. The distance between the photoelectrochemical
cell and the light source was about 5 cm.
