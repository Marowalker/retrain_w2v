This is an all-electron
density functional study of a cluster with
155 H2S molecules subjected to pressures between 0.2 and 681.2 GPa.
For modeling pressure, the cluster was in a container made of 500
He atoms. As the pressure increased, the bond length between the atoms
decreased. This decrease changed the atomic distribution of the cluster.
Initially, the H2S molecules interacted weakly through
hydrogen bonds. Then, the pressure moved the H atoms along the axis
connecting two sulfur atoms, with S–H bond lengths between
1.4 and 1.6 Å. At high pressures, the atomic distribution consisted
of interleaved layers of H and S atoms. The energy density of states
of the valence band had two sub-bands with an energy gap between them.
The overlapping of the 2a1 molecular orbitals of the H2S molecules determined the molecular orbitals in the low-energy sub-band.
In this sub-band, the molecular orbital with the lowest energy has
no nodes; at high pressures, it has non-zero values for all the internuclear
regions of the cluster. The overlapping of the molecular orbitals
1b2, 3a1, and 1b1 of the H2S molecules determined the orbitals
in the high-energy sub-band. The energy band gap (lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital–highest occupied molecular orbital) decreased
with the pressure, from 5.3906 eV for 0.2 GPa to 0.4980 eV for 681.2
GPa, whereas the gap between the sub-bands decreased from 4.7729 eV
for 0.2 GPa to 0.03 eV for pressures higher than 125.5 GPa. The present
study provides, from first principles, an idea on the role of hydrogen
atoms in the evolution of solid phases of H2S with pressure,
which is difficult to obtain from experiments.

Introduction
At high pressures, sulfur and lanthanum
hydrides show superconductivity
at temperatures above 200 K.1,2 Till now, these hydrides
are the superconducting materials with the highest transition temperature
to the superconducting state. Their discovery was the corollary of
predictions that pure hydrogen or hydrogen-rich compounds could be
superconductors with a high transition temperature.3,4

Of the superconducting hydrides with a transition temperature higher
than 200 K, the H2S system has been attractive for its
analysis in detail. It contains only two types of atoms: sulfur and
hydrogen; both atoms have a low atomic number. In addition to this
property, at low pressures, in this system, the solid phases are molecular
with the H2S molecule as the basic unit.

Although
the solid phases of H2S are crystalline, with
translational symmetry, most of their properties depend on their local
atomic order, which is determined by the interaction between the H2S units that build the solid.

This local atomic order
can be analyzed in clusters of H2S, even when the cluster
has only one molecule.

Small clusters with hundreds of H2S units can be studied
in detail using techniques of quantum mechanics. This study can be
conducted even using the all-electron techniques because the sulfur
and hydrogen atoms have a reduced number of electrons. With these
techniques, it is possible to obtain the evolution of the local atomic
order when the cluster is under pressure. The information obtained
in these conditions can help to understand the properties of the H2S system, including its superconducting behavior.

The
study of the evolution, with pressure, of the local atomic
order in clusters of the H2S system, is fascinating because
the properties of this system, under pressure, had been studied for
many years.

The analysis of the H2S system began
at ambient pressure,
where it presents the polymorphs I, II, and III at different temperatures.5 Experiments, at this pressure, with electron
diffraction,6 nuclear magnetic resonance,7 X-ray diffraction, and neutron diffraction8 confirmed the existence of these polymorphs.

In the first experiments with solid H2S under pressure,
the P–V isotherms were measured
from 0 to 1 GPa, generating a phase diagram.9 This diagram was extended using Raman spectroscopy, at pressures
up to 23 GPa at room temperature10 and
pressures up to 20 GPa at 30 K.11

Because the pressure changes the atomic distribution, the solid
phases of H2S were analyzed with X-ray powder diffraction
at room temperature and pressures up to 20 GPa.12 These experiments provided only the atomic distribution
of the sulfur atoms because the diffraction of the hydrogen atoms
is undistinguished from the background. These experiments discovered
polymorph IV of the solid H2S, which had previously been
proposed from studies with Raman spectroscopy.13

Experiments at room temperature and pressures between
27 and 42
GPa showed the existence of polymorph V of solid H2S. With
the pressure, this polymorph transformed from yellow to black, which
is said to be produced by the reduction of the energy band gap.14

Infrared spectroscopy studies, above 46
GPa, suggested that the
H2S molecules dissociated into H and S atoms.15 In these studies, the samples became opaque
to radiation at pressures above 96 GPa, which the authors interpreted
as metallization of the phases, produced by the interaction between
the S atoms in the crystalline structure.

Ab initio molecular
dynamics calculations, using periodic boundary
conditions,16 suggested the transformation
of polymorph V into a new H2S solid: polymorph VI. This
transformation explained the disappearance of the SH stretching bands
in the region of 2300–2500 cm–1 at pressures
higher than 46 GPa.15 Polymorph VI appears
at 65 GPa with a crystalline structure formed by layers of S atoms
alternating with layers of H atoms.16 These
calculations suggest that the S–S interactions in the sulfur
layers generate the opacity to light that occurs at pressures above
96 GPa.15

Using solid-state calculations,
Li et al.17 investigated the possible origin
of the proposed metallic behavior
in the H2S system when subjected to pressure. Their calculations
predicted new stable polymorphs of solid H2S, including
a superconductor at 80 K.

These results induced the experimental
groups to search for this
superconducting phase, in particular, to groups of experts in the
analysis of superconducting hydrides.18 The experiments of these groups culminated in the discovery of superconductivity
in the H2S system at 203 K.2 It is interesting to note that this was the first experiment, which
showed the existence of the metallic behavior of some of the solid
phases of H2S under pressure.

After this discovery,
several groups tried to determine, from the
experiments, the crystalline structure of the superconducting phase.19−23 So far, the proposed crystalline structures are not conclusive.

The present work describes ab initio, all-electron molecular calculations,
using density functional theory (DFT), of a cluster containing 155
molecules of H2S, which is subject to pressure.

This
study helps to understand the evolution, with the pressure,
of the local atomic order in solid H2S. For example, the
changes that occur in the lengths of the S–S and S–H
bonds. These changes are essential to understand the evolution of
the crystalline structure and the electronic properties with pressure.

The study compares the changes observed, with the pressure, in
the atomic and electronic distribution in the H2S cluster,
with those changes reported in the literature on solid H2S, which were generated from experiments and calculations developed
with techniques of quantum mechanics.

Results and Discussion
Construction
of the H2S Cluster
The H2S clusters
were generated from H2S crystallites
constructing using the atomic sulfur distribution described by Strobel et al.,24 obtained from X-ray powder diffraction and Rietveld
refinement. Sulfur atoms occupy the 8h Wyckoff sites with x = 0.162 in a tetragonal crystalline structure. The unit
cell has the symmetry described by the space group I/4mcm and lattice parameters a =
7.37 Å and c = 6.07 Å.

As the X-ray
diffraction produced by the H atoms is too low, its contribution to
X-ray diffraction patterns hides in the background. Therefore, Strobel
et al. did not give the positions of the hydrogen atoms. In the reported
structure, S–S distances have three different values: 3.890
Å (the most abundant), 3.546, and 3.377 Å.

The generated
H2S clusters had different dimensions.
However, the results reported in the present work correspond to a
cluster formed by 155 molecules of H2S.

During the
construction of the cluster, to obtain the hydrogen
atom positions, two hydrogen atoms decorated each S atom with S–H
bond lengths of 1.3 Å and an H–S–H angle of 180°.
Then, with the sulfur atoms in fixed positions, the geometry of the
cluster was optimized to its minimum energy.

After this optimization,
the two H atoms associated with each sulfur
atom appeared bonded to it with an average bond length of 1.38 Å,
forming H–S–H angles of 94°. These values were
like the S–H bond length and the H–S–H angle
of the H2S molecule, calculated with the same method and
basis used for the calculations performed with the 155 H2S cluster. After that, a new geometry optimization was performed,
where the positions of S and H atoms changed until the cluster reached
its minimum energy.

In the optimized geometry, the sulfur atoms
formed H2S molecules with S–H bond lengths of 1.38
Å, interacting
with each other through hydrogen bonds. Most of these bonds had lengths
of about 2.54 Å; the corresponding S–S distances were
around 3.897 Å.

Construction of the He Container
The pressure was modeled
with a container made of a spherical shell of He atoms. The shell
was constructed from a fullerene having 500 atoms and a radius of
9.973 Å,25 where He atoms replaced
the carbon atoms.

The initial average radius of the 155 H2S cluster was 10.712 Å, which was larger than the radius
of the He shell. Therefore, to bring the cluster to the container,
the radius of the container was expanded to 13.962 Å after multiplying
by 1.4, the initial coordinates of the He atoms. The origin of these
coordinates was the center of the container.

For modeling pressure
on the cluster, the radius of the He container
was reduced. The radius of the shortest container, 7.480 Å, was
0.75 times the initial radius of the fullerene.

Embedding the
155 H2S Cluster into the 500 He Container
The
H2S cluster in the He container gave rise to the
155 H2S–500 He system (Figure 1) which had 965 atoms (500 He, 155 S, and
310 H). This system was used to study the atomic distributions and
the corresponding electronic properties of the 155 H2S
cluster as a function of pressure.

Figure 1 One hundred and fifty-five H2S molecules embedded in
the container made with 500 He atoms.

For a given container radius, the positions of the He atom
did
not change, while those of S and H atoms varied until the entire system
reached its minimum energy. For the container having a radius of 13.962
Å, after the energy minimization, the average radius of the external
atoms of the cluster was 11.757 Å (Table 1). As a convention, the radius associated
with the cluster was obtained by dividing by two the sum of the radius
of the container and the average radius of the external atoms in the
cluster. With this definition, the corresponding radius of the cluster
was 12.860 Å, which gives a volume of 8908.1 Å3 (Table 1).

The static pressure in the cluster due to
the variation of the
radius of the container was obtained by using eq 1. 1  ∂E is the variation
of the total energy of the cluster, and ∂V is its variation in volume. N is the number of
atoms, and T is the temperature.

The total
energy of the cluster can be obtained using two different
methods. First, calculating the energy of the container, E500He, and then subtracting it from the total energy of
the system (Table 2). Second, obtaining this energy using all the H and S atoms in the
cluster, E155H2S (Table 2).

a Ecluster is the energy associated with
the cluster 155 H2S.

The energy values of the cluster using the two previous methods
were different, with a difference that increases with pressure. Therefore,
the total energy of the cluster, Ecluster, was considered as the average value, ((Etotal – E500He) + E155H2S)/2.0, of the energy obtained using the
two previous methods. For the lower pressures, Etotal – E500He was smaller
than E155H2S; therefore, for
these pressures, E155H2S was
approached as the energy of the cluster.

Figure 2 shows the
total energy of the cluster, Ecluster versus
cluster volume, V, for the different diameters of
the container. Because only ten (Ecluster, V) points were determined, they cannot be used
alone to calculate the pressure at each point. It was necessary to
find a continuous derivative function that described the evolution
of the points. This function is granted to obtain pressure using eq 1.

Figure 2 Total energy of the 155
H2S cluster as a function of
its volume for different container radii.

The continuous derivative function was generated by fitting
the
set of (Ecluster, V)
points with the sum of decreasing exponentials described by eq 2. 2  with Eo = −61 902.5(1)
eV, A1 = 3662(99) eV, t1 = 0.28(1) Å3, A2 = 252(6) eV, and t2 = 1.07(1)
Å3 (the continuous curve in Figure 2). The parameters Eo, A1, t1, A2, and t2 were optimized using the mean square error method. The derivative
of this curve at each point provides the corresponding pressure value
(Table 3).

Evolution of the Atomic Distribution of the 155 H2S Cluster with Pressure
After embedding the cluster into
the container and optimizing the geometry of the system, the pressure
in the cluster was 0.2 GPa (Table 3). At this pressure, almost all S–S distances
were in the distribution centered at 3.76 Å. A few S–S
distances distributed around 3.42 Å (Figure 3A, Table 4).

At 0.2 GPa,
the H2S molecules interacted with each other
via weak hydrogen bonds, with bond lengths distributed around 2.40
Å (Table 4, Figure 4A). The H2S molecules on the surface of the cluster favored the interaction
between the H and He atoms. At this pressure, the surface of the cluster
contained approximately 10% of all the H atoms (Table 1).

Figure 4 S–H pair distribution function for different
pressures.
(A) 0.2, (B) 17.5, (C) 125.5, and (D) 361.7 GPa.

The distances S–S decreased when the pressure in the
cluster
increased to 5.6 GPa (Table 4). This decrease reflects the contraction of the hydrogen
bond length between the H2S molecules, from 2.40 to 2.11
Å (Table 4). This
trend continued until 17.5 GPa, where the lengths of the hydrogen
bonds had a distribution centered at 1.96 Å (Table 4).

At 17.5 GPa, some H2S molecules lost their molecular
behavior. They were polymerized forming chains with two, three, or
four units of H2S. The hydrogen atoms located between two
sulfur atoms. The length of the S–H bonds was distributed around
1.38 and 1.96 Å, whereas the angles S–H–S distributed
around 177°. During polymerization, a stronger interaction between
the H2S units replaced the hydrogen bond.

The transformation
of the hydrogen bonds was like the symmetrization
of the hydrogen bond reported for ice and boehmite under pressure.26,27

This polymerization can be the precursor of the reported polymeric
phases with symmetry Pmc21 and P1̅.16 These phases were
found at high pressures using quantum mechanical calculations with
periodic boundary conditions.16

The
degree of polymerization of the H2S units increased
with pressure. At 47.5 GPa, most of the H2S units polymerized
and cross-linked. At this pressure, the S–S distances distributed
around 3.03 and 2.67 Å (Table 4). For the S–S distances centered around 3.03
Å, one H atom located between the two sulfur atoms, with S–H
bond lengths distributed around 1.37 and 1.74 Å (Table 4), and the S–H–S
angle distributed around 166°. The analysis of the atomic distribution
shows that the short distances S–S (2.67 Å) corresponded
to the interaction S–S without any atom of hydrogen between
the atoms of sulfur.

This polymerization explains the behavior
that Sakashita et al.15 observed at 46
GPa and interpreted as dissociation
of the H2S molecules.

At 76 GPa, the polymerization
SHS was almost complete. Distances
S–S were distributed around 2.94 Å, with one H between
the atoms of S. The respective angles S–H–S distributed
around 166°; the length of the S–H bond centered around
1.38 and 1.61 Å. At this pressure, the length of the S–S
bond (without H between the S atoms) contracted to 2.57 Å. The
respective infrared spectrum disappeared because the H2S units lost their molecular nature.

As the pressure increased,
this atomic distribution remained nearly
constant, even at 125.5 GPa. At this pressure, the S–S contracted
to values of 2.85 and 2.47 Å, whereas the lengths of the S–H
bonds did not change (Table 4). The contraction of the distances S–S with an atom
of H in the middle had three effects. First, the angles S–H–S
decreased from 166 to 145°. Second, some H atoms were displaced,
favoring the H–H interaction. The shortest distance between
the displaced H atoms (Figure 5D) was similar to that observed in molecular hydrogen (0.75
Å). However, the H atoms continued to interact with the corresponding
S atoms. Third, the displacement of H atoms increased the number of
S–S bonds in the system (Figure 3C). The number of H atoms on the surface of the 155
H2S cluster also increased. The number was approximated
triple (108 H atoms) than for the low pressures (Table 1).

Figure 5 H–H pair distribution
function for different pressures.
(A) 0.2, (B) 17.5, (C) 125.5, and (D) 361.7 GPa.

The number of displaced H atoms increased with pressure (Figure 3D) because the S–S
distances contracted (Figure 3D). At 208.3 GPa, the S–S distances were distributed
around 2.77 and 2.37 Å. The lengths of the S–H bond did
not change (Table 4), but the displacement of H atoms favored the H–H interactions
and changed their distribution. At 208.3 GPa, the hydrogen and sulfur
atoms ordered into a layer of 133 H atoms on the cluster surface;
then, a concentric layer of 94 S atoms mixed with 8 H atoms and another,
more in-depth, concentric layer of 90 atoms of H. In the region of
smaller cluster radii, the S and H atoms were mixed.

The previous
trend continued for higher pressures (Table 4). At the highest pressure,
the S–S distances had values of the same magnitude that the
S–S bond lengths in the chains of 8 sulfur atoms formed at
room temperature in pure sulfur.28 These
values are also similar to those of S–S bond lengths in sulfur
under high pressures29,30 and in superconducting sulfur.31

However, it should be noted that the sulfur
atoms did not segregate
to build sulfur clusters. They always interacted with a distribution
of H atoms. This result is consistent with the phase diagram and symmetrization
in solid D2S obtained with micro-Raman spectroscopy.32

At high pressures, 361.7 and 681.2 GPa,
in the cluster, approximately
45% (Table 1) of all
the H atoms (141 in total) were on the surface of the cluster. To
these atoms followed an inner layer of 94 S atoms and then a layer
that had 90 H atoms. For very internal diameters in the cluster, the
H and S atoms were mixed.

Pressures above 100 GPa favored the
formation of a laminar structure.
In the present case, the container of He was a spherical shell. Therefore,
the generated layers had spherical symmetry.

A container in
the shape of a parallelepiped would result in the
formation of alternative flat sheets made of H or S atoms, as reported
for phase VI of solid H2S at high pressures, obtained with
molecular dynamics calculations using periodic boundary conditions.16

Molecular dynamical calculations for 500
fs in the 155 H2S–500 He system at 100 K, under
pressures of 125.5 and 361.7
GPa, showed that the laminar atomic distribution was stable.

The electronic structure of
the H2S molecule determined the electronic structure of
the 155 H2S cluster.

For the valence electrons in
the H2S molecule, bonding molecular orbital 2a1 is the
one with the lowest energy, −20.6643 eV (Figure 6A). It is at 140.1142 eV above the highest
energy of the core electrons.

In the cluster with 155 H2S molecules, at 0.2

At 0.2 GPa, the valence band of the cluster had two
sub-bands,
separated by an energy gap (inner gap) of 4.7729 eV (Figure 6B, Table 5), which decreased exponentially with the
pressure. This gap was 0.03 eV for pressures higher than 125.5 GPa
(Table 5). The molecular
orbitals in the low energy sub-band depended on the bonding molecular
orbital 2a1 of the H2S molecule (Figure 6A), whereas the molecular orbitals of the
high energy sub-band [including the highest occupied molecular orbital
(HOMO)] depended on the three occupied molecular orbitals 1b2, 3a1,
and 1b1 of the H2S molecule (Figure 6A). The width of both sub-bands increased
with pressure (Figure 6B–E).

At a pressure of 0.2 GPa in the cluster, the energy
gap, the energy
difference between the HOMO and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) energies, was 5.3906 eV (Table 5). This gap was smaller than the corresponding energy
gap for an isolated H2S molecule (7.8342 eV). As the pressure
increased, the LUMO energy decreased exponentially, whereas the HOMO
energy increased exponentially (Figure 7, Table 5). These changes in energy resulted in an exponential decrease in
the energy band gap (Figure 8, Table 5).

Figure 8 Energy band gap (difference between LUMO energy and HOMO
energy)
and the energy gap (inner gap) between the sub-bands in the valence
band, as a function of the pressure.

The increase in pressure also modified the energy density
of states.
For example, the energy gap between sub-bands decreased exponentially
(Figure 8, Table 5). Clusters with more
H2S molecules would produce a better definition of this
gap at high pressures.

The experimental band gap reported for
solid H2S under
a pressure of 0.3 GPa is 4.8 eV,33 which
is less than the band gap obtained for the cluster of 155 H2S molecules, 5.3906 eV, at 0.2 GPa but approaches the energy gap
between the sub-bands, 4.7729 eV, at this pressure. The experimental
value of the reported energy gap for solid H2S under a
pressure of 29 GPa is 2.7 eV,33 which is
less than the value of 3.6844 eV obtained for the band gap of the
cluster at 47.5 GPa and similar to the energy gap between the sub-bands,
2.86 eV, at this pressure.

Spatial Distribution of the Molecular Orbitals
with Pressure
The spatial distribution of the molecular orbitals
of the 155 H2S cluster correlates with the spatial distribution
of the
H2S molecule.

For the valence electrons in the H2S molecule, bonding molecular orbital 2a1 (Figure 9A) has the lowest energy (−20.6643
eV, Figure 6A). Its
composition analysis of Mulliken34,35 shows that
the atomic orbital 1s of the hydrogen atoms contribute to 19.46%.
The atomic orbitals of the sulfur atom contribute with the following
values: 2s, 76.28%; 2px, 2.84%; 2pz, 1.42%. This molecular orbital is distributed,
without nodes, throughout the space of the H2S molecule.

electrons of the H2S molecule. (A) Molecular orbital 2a1,

orbital 1b1 (HOMO), energy E = −7.2246 eV.

The molecular orbital with the
next higher energy (−12.3866
eV, Figure 6A) is bonding
molecular orbital 1b2 (Figure 9B). This orbital is a mixture of the 2px and 2pz atomic orbitals of sulfur
and the antisymmetric linear combination of the atomic orbital 1s
of the two H atoms. The molecular orbital with the next higher energy
(−9.7934 eV, Figure 6A) is antibonding orbital 3a1 (Figure 9C). This molecular orbital is a mixture of
the 2s, 2px, and 2pz atomic orbitals of the sulfur with the atomic orbital 1s of
the H atoms. Nonbonding (“lone pair”) molecular orbital
1b1, with the highest energy (−7.2246 eV, Figure 6A), is the HOMO (Figure 9D), formed with the atomic
orbitals 2py of the sulfur atom.

The DFT calculations showed that the molecular orbitals that describe
the valence electrons of the H2S molecule were the basis
for constructing the molecular orbitals of the valence band of the
155 H2S cluster (Figure 6).

In this cluster, the bonding molecular orbital
2a1 of the H2S molecules determined the molecular orbitals
of the low-energy
sub-band of the cluster. All molecular orbitals in this sub-band have
a reduced number of nodes (Figure 10). Of these, at high pressures, the LOMOVB is a bonding
molecular orbital with non-zero values in all the internuclear regions
of the cluster (Figure 10A).

With pressure, the overlapping of the molecular orbitals
1b2, 3a1,
and 1b1 of the H2S molecules determined the spatial distribution
of the molecular orbitals of the high energy sub-band of the 155 H2S cluster. In this sub-band, the molecular orbitals have nodes
(Figure 11) even at
the highest pressure. As an example, Figure 12 shows the evolution of the HOMO with pressure.

The next paragraph describes in detail the evolution of the
LOMOVB
with the pressure (Figure 13). At a pressure of 0.2 GPa, the atomic orbitals of only a
small number of H2S molecules contributed to its construction;
this number increased with pressure.

This bonding molecular orbital was a mixture of the 1s atomic
orbital
of the hydrogen atoms and the atomic orbitals 2s, 2px, 2pz, and 2py of the sulfur atoms. The composition analysis of Mulliken
gave the following percentages of these atomic orbitals. For a pressure
of 0.2 GPa, 19.49% of the 1s of the hydrogen atoms, 76.82% of the
2s, 0.33% of the 2px, 0.63% of the 2py, and 2.73% of the 2pz of the sulfur atoms. This composition is similar to that of
an isolated H2S molecule.

For the pressure of 361.7
GPa, the composition analysis of Mulliken
of the LOMOVB was 11.33% of the 1s atomic orbital of the hydrogen
atoms, 87.80% of the 2s, 0.44% of the 2px, −0.40% of the 2py, and 0.83%
of the 2pz atomic orbitals of the sulfur
atoms.

These results show that the LOMOVB is predominantly the
mixture
of the 1s atomic orbitals of the hydrogen atoms, with the 2s atomic
orbitals of the sulfur atoms. Table 6 shows the evolution of the composition of this molecular
orbital with pressure. It provides the number of atomic orbitals that
contribute, above a threshold (in %), to the molecular orbital.

a The number (N)
of atomic orbitals that generate it, for different population thresholds
absolute values, as a function of pressure.

For 0.2 GPa, the molecular orbital located in a small
number of
H2S molecules. Therefore, 32 atomic orbitals were enough
to generate 98% of it. At 17.5 GPa, to obtain this percentage of the
molecular orbital, the number of atomic orbitals was 603. This number
indicates that more and more H2S entities contribute to
the LOMOVB as the pressure increased. These results agree with the
spatial distribution of this molecular orbital as a function of the
pressure, which is shown in Figure 13.

Table 7 shows the
increase, with pressure, in the number of atomic orbitals that overlap
during the generation of the LOMOVB. For example, for the pressure
of 0.2 GPa, the overlap contributed 34.11%, whereas for the pressure
of 76.0 GPa, the contribution was 60.57%. The overlap of 34.11% corresponds,
basically, to the superposition of the atomic orbitals during the
construction of bonding molecular orbital 2a1 of the almost isolated
155 H2S molecules. The difference between these values
(26.46%) corresponds to the overlap of the atomic orbitals that describe
the internuclear contributions of the molecular orbital.

Conclusions
To
model the pressure on a cluster that has 155 H2S
molecules; the cluster was embedded in a container made of a spherical
shell of 500 He atoms. The reduction in the diameter of the container
was enough to model the pressure on the cluster between 0.2 to 681.2
GPa. The size of the system, the cluster and the container (500 He,
155 S and 310 H), allowed a DFT study, ab initio, and all-electron
of the atomic distribution and electronic properties of the cluster
as a function of pressure.

The atomic distribution of the 155
H2S molecules in
the cluster changed with the pressure. At low pressures, the H2S molecules interacted with each other through a hydrogen
bond, with a bond length of 2.40 Å. As the pressure increased,
a strong interaction replaced the hydrogen bond. This interaction
had H–S bond lengths between 1.40 and 1.64 Å with the
H atoms between two sulfur atoms. At higher pressures, the H atoms
moved from the axis connecting the respective sulfur atoms, generating
intercalated layers of pure H and pure S in the 155 H2S
cluster, with strong interactions between all the atoms.

The
energy density of states had two sub-bands in the valence band,
with an energy gap between them that decreased with pressure. The
sub-band of low energy corresponded to the molecular orbitals of the
cluster generated by the overlap of the binding molecular orbital
2a1 of the H2S molecules. The high-energy sub-band corresponded
to the molecular orbitals of the cluster generated by the overlap
of the molecular orbitals 1b2, 3a1, and 1b1 of the H2S
molecules. All molecular orbitals of the cluster in this sub-band
have nodes.

The molecular orbitals of the cluster in the sub-band
at low energies
have a reduced number of nodes. The molecular orbital with the lowest
energy, the LOMOVB, has no nodes; at high pressures, it has non-zero
contribution in all the internuclear regions of the cluster. This
molecular orbital is predominantly the mixture of the atomic orbital
1s of the hydrogen atoms, with the atomic orbitals 2s of the sulfur
atoms.

The energy band gap, the difference between the LUMO
and the HOMO
energies, decreased exponentially with the pressure from 5.3906 eV
for 0.2 GPa to 0.4980 eV for 681.2 GPa. The energy gap between sub-bands
decreased from 4.7729 eV for 0.2 GPa to 0.03 eV for pressures greater
than 125.5 GPa.

The present study provides, from first principles,
an idea on the
role of the hydrogen atoms in the evolution of the solid phases of
H2S with the pressure, which is difficult to obtain from
experiments.

Method
The total energies of the
H2S system were calculated
using DFT. In this theory, a single determinant of molecular orbitals
represents the electron wave function. The orbitals were generated
using basis set 6-31g and self-consistently solving the DFT Kohn–Sham
one-electron equations.36 The generalized
gradient functional B3LYP37,38 modeled the energy
of exchange–correlation. Dispersion correction was added to
the functional.39

Molecular dynamics
calculations were performed on the system using
the microcanonical ensemble (NVE), with an integration
time step of 0.3 fs, and the velocity rescaling thermostat. The rescaling
time was much longer than the desired simulation time (500 fs).40,41

Some calculations were made using the functionals LC-PBE42 and LC_PBE043 to
see if the results did not depend on the exchange correlation model
associated with the functional. Some calculations were repeated using
basis set 6-31g**, which includes polarization functions in the hydrogen
and sulfur atoms. The results were not different from those obtained
with basis set 6-31g.

TeraChem44,45 was the code
that was used to
perform the molecular calculations. Algorithm L-BFGS46 generated the atomic distribution of the system with minimum
energy, with the following convergence conditions: an energy threshold
of 10–6 hartree, a maximum step of 10–3 Bohr, an rms step of 10–3 Bohr, a maximum gradient
of 10–4 hartree/Bohr, and an rms gradient of 10–4 hartree/Bohr. For the calculations, we used two workstations:
one with 4 Nvidia Tesla Kepler K80 GPU cards and another one with
3 Nvidia Tesla V100 GPU cards.

The VMD code47 was used to analyze orbitals
and pair distribution functions and to inspect the distribution of
the atoms in the cluster.

The code MULTIWFM (V. 3.5)34 was used
to perform the analysis of the composition of Mulliken.35
