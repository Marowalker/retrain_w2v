Anharmonicity can
greatly affect rate constants. One or even several
orders of magnitude of deviation are found for obtaining rate constants
using the standard rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator model. In turn,
reactive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are a powerful way to
explore chemical reaction networks and calculate rate constants from
the fully anharmonic potential energy surface. However, the classical
nature of the dynamics and the required numerical efficiency of the
force field limit the accuracy of the resulting kinetics. We combine
the best of both worlds by presenting an approximation that pairs
anharmonic information intrinsic to classical MD with high-accuracy
energies and frequencies from quantum-mechanical electronic structure
calculations. The proposed scheme is applied to hydrogen abstractions
in the methane system, which allows for the benchmarking of rate constants
corrected by our approach against experimental rate constants. This
comparison reveals a standard deviation of factor 2.6. Two archetypes
of possible failure are identified in the course of a detailed investigation
of the CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 reaction. From this
follows the application range of the method, within which the method
shows a standard deviation of factor 2.1. The computational efficiency
and beneficial scaling of the method allow for application to larger
systems, as shown for hydrogen abstraction from 2-butanone by HO2•.

1 Introduction
Rate constants play an essential role in the quantitative modeling
of chemical reaction networks. Technical combustion simulations and
chemical reactors rely on reaction kinetics to model the complex interaction
of fluid- and thermodynamics. Such models can predict ignition delay
times and pollutant and soot formation.1

Many of the reaction rate constants are predicted by suitable
theories,
such as transition state theory (TST)2,3 in combination
with accurate quantum-mechanical (QM) methods. Due to its simplicity
and long history of study, TST is a powerful tool that provides a
solid estimate even for rates that are too elusive to be studied in
experiments. TST relies on a free-energy model for reactants and transition
states (TSs) of the reaction, of which one of the simplest is the
rigid-rotor harmonic-oscillator (RRHO) model. It assumesa that all degrees of freedom (DoFs) of a molecule are uncoupled
and that vibrations follow a parabolic (quadratic) potential energy
curve.

Nowadays, the treatment of anharmonicity has become a
bottleneck
in accurate descriptions of many reaction equilibria and rate constant
calculations, for example, in biofuel combustion.4 This is because of developments of very accurate electronic
structure calculation methods (for example, compound methods) that
compute electronic energies within a few kJ/mol of uncertainty.5 By contrast, the standard model for the motion
of nuclei, the RRHO model, often fails to reproduce Gibbs free energies
within 10 kJ/mol of uncertainty.6−8 Torsions like coupled hindered
rotation, among other large amplitude motions, are especially insufficiently
described by quadratic potentials, and such a description would introduce
serious errors.9,10 It is therefore a necessity for
accurate calculations to go beyond the RRHO model.

While a full
treatment of coupled anharmonic motions is possible
and provides an excellent description of a few DoFs, it is computationally
demanding and therefore only viable for the study of small systems
with high accuracy. Thus, several approximations have been described
to improve on the RRHO model. Hindered rotations can be described
by a set of 1D cosine potentials11 instead
of quadratic potentials. Also, the coupling of HRs can be accounted
for.12,13 The quartic force field (QFF) approach14,15 and the second-order perturbation method (VPT2)16,17 include higher derivatives of the potential well for a more accurate
description of the nonquadratic part of the well. They extend the
(HO) description in one dimension and also allow for a limited amount
of coupling between DoFs. For small species with only one conformation,
the vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) approximation proves to
yield good results. Nevertheless, for larger species with many minima,
the method (in addition to becoming computationally very demanding)
fails because a larger number of minima cannot be represented in the
Taylor expansion of the potential energy surface (PES) up to only
fourth order.18−20 Monte Carlo Phase Space Sampling (MCPSI)21 uses sampling techniques on the molecular phase
space to explore the potential energy environment and derive correction
factors for the RRHO model. While these methods substantially increase
the accuracy of partition functions, they require additional calculations
apart from the ones required for RRHO. In total, computational methods
have become very accurate but so computationally demanding that their
application, besides requiring attention to details of the specific
reaction, is still limited to systems containing at most a few heavy
atoms.22

Due to that steep scaling
of computational demands with an increasing
number of DoFs or increasing number of reactions in a network, less
accurate but more efficient models become more feasible. When studying
a complex reaction network of an unknown mechanism, hundreds of reactions
come up that have never been studied before. To identify the important
pathways of the mechanism, it is preferable to maximize the completeness
of the mechanism rather than the accuracy of the rate constants. Computationally
intensive methods would then only be used to refine the rate constant
predictions on those important paths of the network.

Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations are a good way to explore reaction
networks on a large scale.23,24 MD simulations follow
the time evolution of chemical systems, while effectively, but classically,
sampling the available phase space of each reactant and TS. This avoids
the need for any RRHO-based or uncoupled approximations to account
for anharmonic effects but neglects QM effects. With a software tool,
for example, the Chemical Trajectory analYzer (CTY) used in this study
that analyzes changes in chemical composition in an MD trajectory,
these simulations can be used to compute rate constants based on the
number of reaction events that change the chemical composition and
current concentration of respective reactants.23,24

Other techniques to sample the free-energy surface and derive
rate
constants from MD include Meta Dynamics (MTD),25 Transition Interface Sampling (TIS),26 Forward Flux Sampling (FFS),27 and Stochastic Process Rare Event Sampling (S-PRES).28 They work with a biased potential or an algorithm
to stop and restart the MD simulation at specified conditions. This
way, the sampling is focused on certain events of interest that are
too rare to be covered with unbiased MD in reasonably accessible time
scales. We chose not to bias our simulations, with the downside of
missing those rare events, but with the advantages of getting a broad
variety of reactions of the mechanism of interest and not needing
any prior information on reaction coordinates.

Building on that,
we derive an efficient correction scheme for
rate constants of large mechanisms using MD simulations. We estimate
the influence of anharmonicity on rate constants using knowledge from
these simulations. Consequently, we also need to estimate the effect
of using classical instead of quantum mechanics using the Pitzer–Gwinn
(PG) approximation.29 Efficiency is ensured
by the use of a fast reactive force field for the MD simulation.

We apply the scheme to hydrogen abstraction reactions that occur
in a CH4/O2 mixture under high pressures as
well as at high temperatures and obtain a first rate constant estimate
by measuring rates based on respective events during the simulation.
We further isolate reactants and TSs of these reactions to obtain
classical partition functions and QM RRHO partition functions for
the ideal gas and use them to calculate RRHO-TST rate constants. This
way, we obtain different expressions for the same rate constant accounting
for anharmonic effects, QM effects, recrossing, and tunneling. After
combining them, we derive a new rate constant expression that incorporates
all of these effects.

2 Theory
2.1 Transition
State Theory
Rate constants
can be modeled by TST and extensions as30 1  While TST
is essentially a semiclassical theory,
meaning that the reaction coordinate is also described semiclassically,30 we use QM (and anharmonic) partition functions Q of the TS (‡) and the reactants (R). ΔE0 is the zero-point-corrected potential energy
difference between reactants and TS, β is the inverse product
of Boltzmann’s constant kB and
the temperature T, and h is Planck’s
constant. Tunneling and nonclassical reflection are handled by the
correction factor κ, and g accounts for nonequilibrium
(also called “nonthermalized”) reactants. Nonthermalized
reactants may occur preferably at low pressures, when such reactants
are energetically excited from a previous reaction.31,32 The effect of nonthermalized reactants is intrinsically contained
when running MD simulations; in our study, we choose high pressure
to ensure thermalization of species and therefore g ≈ 1.

Γ is a prefactor accounting for recrossing.
The TS is ideally the dividing surface between the reactant and product
basins through which the recrossing of trajectories is minimal.33 As most trajectories will follow the path of
minimum energy between the reactant and product basins, the dividing
surface can be set at the point of highest energy on this path so
that it is perpendicular to the path. Such a point is a saddle point
on the PES with vanishing gradients, and it can be associated with
one specific geometry. A saddle point is robustly found by geometry
optimization methods, which is why it is commonly used as the TS,
instead of the many-geometry dividing surface. We will use this as
a practical definition for the TS throughout our work. The discrepancy
to the ideal TS is addressed in variational TST.34,35

In the MD analysis, there is no need to explicitly define
a TS.
However, a dividing surface that minimizes recrossing is needed. For
simplicity, potential reaction events are identified when a bond order
crosses a half-integer value (0.5, 1.5, or 2.5). Since these bond
orders do not correspond to the maximum in free energy between reactants
and products, they are only poor estimates for the dividing surface.
Therefore, when such a crossing event is detected, the trajectory
is further observed for a recrossing time interval of 2 ps to check
if a recrossing event occurs. Only if no recrossing occurs, the event
is considered as a reaction. If the results were independent of the
recrossing time interval and statistics were good, this would yield
the same rate constants as if using an optimal dividing surface that
may even by curved in a complicated manner. Practically, it turned
out that the results depend only very weakly on the recrossing time
interval in the range of 2 ps,23 and the
results are therefore a good approximation to those obtained from
a perfect dividing surface.

2.2 Combination Scheme
As outlined in Section 1, a rate constant
that features anharmonic and QM partition functions requires expensive
calculations. We present an efficient approximation scheme that makes
use of the anharmonic information that is contained in reactive trajectories
of MD simulations. Once extracted, this information is applied in
the form of a correction factor to a RRHO rate constant calculated
from a high-level QM PES. This way, we obtain a rate constant from
feasible calculations that has the potential to agree quantitatively
with experimental results.

Nevertheless, our correction method
comes with potential inaccuracies. To cover the large time scales
required in MD for reactions to happen, we have to make the calculation
of a single time step fast enough. We are therefore employing an empirical
force field (FF). FFs are less accurate with respect to, for example,
energies and gradients than standard ab initio methods. A further
approximation intrinsic to MD is the use of classical mechanics. To
use anharmonic information from MD simulations to obtain accurate,
quantum-mechanical rate constants, we have to follow two approximations
in the derivation of our scheme. The first (eq 2) is known as the Pitzer–Gwinn approximation,29 relating classical to quantum-mechanical partition
functions via the ratio of their HO partition functions. A second
(eq 3), similar approximation
must be done regarding the transferability of the anharmonic information
from a low-level (for example, FF) to a high-level (for example, QM)
PES.

The result of our scheme will be a TST rate constant that
features
anharmonic and QM partition functions but is constructed from efficient
calculations. The formulation in eq 1 also allows for the incorporation of a recrossing
correction from the FF and a tunneling correction from the QM potential
energy surface along the way.

The first component of our scheme
is the aforementioned PG approximation,
which relates classical and quantum-mechanical partition functions.
It states that the ratio of the (anharmonic) partition function to
its RRHO approximation stays nearly the same when evaluating it classically
instead of quantum mechanically 2  Here, subscripts “c” and “q”
denote the classical and QM partition functions, respectively. The
superscript “HO” denotes the RRHO approximation of the
otherwise anharmonic partition function (“anh”).

This formula already contains the anharmonic QM partition function Qqanh that we would like to approximate. PG expresses it in terms of either
classical or harmonic partition functions, which we will take advantage
of. Calculating the harmonic part does not pose a difficulty, as it
can be done by known formulas. The remaining part Qcanh is indirectly
contained in rate constants from MD, since they employ anharmonic
and classical kinetics. However, we must keep in mind that the MD
kinetics and thus any partition functions coming from it originate
from an approximate model FF. This makes the introduction of our second
relation necessary, addressing different levels of theory.

Similar
to the PG relation, the second relation states that the
ratio of the partition function to its RRHO approximation stays the
same when calculating it at different levels of theory. Partition
functions of internal modes are strongly influenced by vibrational
frequencies. One often finds that frequencies computed by lower-level
methods (that give large deviation in single-point energies) match
frequencies computed at a higher level quite well.36,37 We therefore assume that in first order, anharmonic partition functions
change with the quality of the PES in direct proportion to the harmonic-oscillator
partition functions, which means frequencies (in the classical case).
This leads to the following relation where we employ a low-level,
empirical FF and a high-level, ab initio PES (QM), which are denoted
by superscripts. 3  This assumption might be bold, as
levels of
theory can differ greatly. While the first (PG) assumption works well
in the cases we need, the assumption described by eq 3 actually has weaknesses in some
of these cases, which we will discuss later.

To make use of
the two relations, we start by defining our desired,
final, corrected rate constant kcorr in
the sense of the TST formalism of eq 1. It should have anharmonic QM partition functions,
a tunneling correction κ, a recrossing correction Γ, and
an accurate barrier ΔEQM. As discussed
earlier, we use thermalized structures and therefore set g ≈ 1. 4  Using the
two relations on partition functions,
we can expand eq 4 by
the classical and harmonic description via eq 2 and then by the high- to low-level PES transfer
via eq 3. We are left
with partition functions that are either low-level or harmonic 5  To compare the partition functions of different
qualities in eq 5, we
define three different TST rate constants, each of them again either
low level or harmonic. The index reflects the origin of calculation.
In particular, these origins are as follows: MD simulations on a low-level
FF PES (kMD), RRHO-TST on the same PES
(kFF), and RRHO-TST on a high-level QM
PES (kQM) 6   7   8  Note that kMD is
recrossing-corrected and kQM is tunneling-corrected,
whereas kFF has no correction factors.
This way, the tunneling correction benefits from the high-level (QM)
description, and the recrossing correction is derived from actual
(MD) kinetics.

To isolate the low-level PES partition functions,
we take the ratio
of the two TST rate constants kMD and kFF. It is important that the trajectories, which kMD consists of, cross the same TS that was chosen
for kFF. Then, as both rate constants
originate from the same PES, their potential barrier ΔEFF is the same and their exponential terms cancel
out 9  This ratio contains the
recrossing correction
and the anharmonic correction for a particular reaction. However,
its partition functions represent classical mechanics on a low-level
model potential, which makes the two transferability assumptions necessary
(eqs 2 and 3).

The product of eqs 8 and 9 then equals the expansion
of kcorr done in eq 5, so we can express our desired TST rate constant
as
a combination of the other three rate constants 10  The three rate
constants on the right-hand
side have to be determined in different ways, which is detailed in Section 5. The resulting kcorr not only incorporates anharmonic and QM
effects but is also both recrossing- and tunneling-corrected.

2.3 Requirements for the Scheme
In line
with eqs 2 and 3 in the derivation of eq 10, there are two basic assumptions in our
scheme for quantum anharmonic corrections:(a) The PG approximation is valid (eq 2).

(b) The ratio of an anharmonic partition
function to its RRHO approximation is approximately invariant to the
level of theory (for example, FF versus ab initio), cf. eq 3.

Assumption
(a) is well-justified; it has been checked for cosine-type
anharmonicity by its inventors,29 for Morse
and quadratic-quartic anharmonicity by Isaacson and Truhlar,38 and for anharmonicity of H2O2 by Ellingson et al.39 We also
added a smaller-meshed test varying curvature and temperature in our
Supporting Information; see Table S1. The
other assumption (b) of transferability of anharmonicity requires
some explanation.

Anharmonicity is transferable using eq 3 in cases that resemble
the one depicted in Figure 1, where one sees a (vibrational) normal mode coordinate of
a TS or a reactant. Here, an anharmonic PES (black, solid line) approximately
doubles the number of energy levels that a harmonic treatment (black,
dashed line) would yield. Now, from a single QM calculation, one would
only be able to derive the RRHO result, not the anharmonic one. Nevertheless,
our scheme can use anharmonic information from a low-level FF calculation
to correct for anharmonicity. The anharmonic FF PES may differ though
from the anharmonic QM PES in a number of ways: the FF PES (dark-blue,
dashed line) in Figure 1 is shifted (corresponding to a different barrier height) and scaled
(corresponding to different vibrational frequencies). Still, it also
approximately doubles the number of energy levels that a harmonic
treatment (blue, dot-dashed line) would yield. Taking the ratio of
the anharmonic partition function on the FF PES to its RRHO counterpart
as a correction factor to the RRHO approximation on the QM PES will
therefore be a good approximation.

Figure 1 Example where anharmonicity can be transferred.
The relation of
energy levels of the high-level PES (black, solid line) to the energy
levels of its HO representation (black, dashed line) is the same as
the relation of the low-level PES (dark-blue, dashed line) with its
HO representation (blue, dot-dashed line).

Anharmonicity can be less transferable by our scheme in other cases
that resemble, for example, those depicted in Figures 2 and 3. In the case
of Figure 2, anharmonic
parts of the real PES or its QM representation relate to the TS substantially
differently than at the FF level. Here, the anharmonic contribution
obtained on the FF level will not be meaningful. In the case of Figure 3, the general behavior
of the TS seems well-captured. Both the FF PES (red, dashed line)
and the QM PES (black, solid line) comprise a minimum of similar width,
so at many temperatures, entropies for both cases will be similar.
Nevertheless, the RRHO approximation (red, dashed line) at the minimum
of the FF PES is considerably flatter than the RRHO approximation
(black, dashed line) to the QM PES. While the HO model ranges per
definition from −∞ to +∞, models in internal
coordinates often have physical limits. A distance shall not become
negative, a bending angle is limited to (0–180°), and
a dihedral angle is limited to (0–360°). A very flat potential
model as the RRHO approximation (red, dashed line) at the minimum
of the FF PES in Figure 3 thus may generate a significant probability of finding the system
in unphysical regions. Distributing the probability density over such
a too-large space leads to too densely spaced energy levels and thereby
leads to overcounting the accessible states of the mode. The lower
the HO frequency, the more substantial this becomes. As a result, kFF gets overestimated. Such kinds of deviation
cannot be corrected for in our scheme.

Figure 2 Example where transfer
of anharmonicity introduces errors: The
low-level PES (red, dotted line) is qualitatively different from the
high-level PES (black, solid line).

Figure 3 Another
example where transfer of anharmonicity introduces errors:
the low-level PES (red, dashed line) seems to match the high-level
PES (black, dashed line) qualitatively, which means it has approximately
the same width. Still, the HO approximation to the low-level PES (red,
dashed line) may reach into unphysical regions, for example, negative
values of a bending angle, already at comparatively small energies
(dependent on kBT) in
contrast to the HO approximation to the high-level PES (black, dashed
line).

To check the applicability of
the proposed method, we therefore
suggest analyzing the low-frequency modes of the reactants and transition
states. If their frequencies are low and differ between the low-level
and the high-level method, the results should be treated with care.

Assumption (b) is used in eq 5 to justify the application of the anharmonic contribution
from the low-level PES to the high-level RRHO-TST rate constant (kQM). Since we use it for the partition functions
of the TS and its reactants at the same time, we can weaken the assumption;
for our needs, it is sufficient that the following ratio of quotients
is invariant to the choice of level of theory 11  Here, the partition function from the original
assumption is replaced by the quotient of partition functions of the
TS and its reactants. It is a weaker assumption simply because it
follows from the original assumption, eq 3, but not the other way around.

The proposed
method can be seen as an extension of RRHO-TST to
model anharmonic effects and non-TST effects better. The most important
criterion for whether the method will work is if the low-level force
field resembles the “true” anharmonicity reasonably
well. This is corroborated by the rate constant corrections presented
in the next section.

3 Results
For the
validation of our method, we chose a set of hydrogen abstraction
reactions from the methane combustion mechanism. This important reaction
class frequently occurs during the chain propagation phase and was
also seen frequently during our MD simulations, so they provide a
solid statistical basis for the rate determination from MD. We chose
reactions of the type R–H + H• ⇌ R• + H2, where R–H is the molecule
undergoing hydrogen abstraction in the forward reaction. Subject to
our study are those reactions where R is one of the radicals CH3•, CH22•, OH•, O2•, or HCO•,
as listed in Table 1. For each forward (f) and backward (b) path, we determined the rate
constants kMD, kFF, and kQM and calculated kcorr.

The Arrhenius plots in Figures 4a–4f and 5a–5d show the determined rate
constants of the five reactions of Table 1 and their backward counterparts. A confidence
interval of 95% is shown for each MD rate constant, dependent on the
observed number of reaction events.61 Experimental
results of other authors are given as references. For comparison,
we partially extrapolated Arrhenius expressions to higher temperatures
to match our simulation conditions. At these conditions, the experimental
data show a standard deviation of a factor of 1.5 (cf. Table S3). One can see that the method yields
an improved rate constant estimate for most reactions but not in general.
On average, the corrected rate constants computed from our scheme
deviate by a factor of 2.6 from the average of the experimental rate
constants; cf. Table S3. We will take a
detailed look at the cases where the method seems to fail. For the
other reactions, kcorr is in good agreement
with reference results.

3.1 Effect of Flat Potentials
All studied
TSs feature a terminal subgroup of the form R···H···H,
where R is the radical product in the forward reaction (see Table 1) and the two H-atoms
form H2. These two H-atoms and the heavy atom (carbon or
oxygen) of R are loosely bound to each other in a (nearly) linear
complex. This floppy structure has a large range of motion, and the
PES is very shallow along the corresponding vibrational modes of the
∠R–H–H angle. This is reflected in the HO frequencies,
which can be exceptionally low. On the other hand, the energy can
rise steeply near the limits of the bending angle near 0 and 180°,
which yields an anharmonicity of the type discussed in Figure 3. Furthermore, being transitional
modes,62,63 the (anharmonic) effect of these frequencies
cannot be expected to cancel in rate or equilibrium constant computations.

Table 2 shows the
two lowest, real-valued, vibrational frequencies of all studied TSs
obtained with the ReaxFF/Agrawalla force field and with B2PLYP-D3BJ/6-311++G(d,p)
density functional theory (DFT). All of them correspond to the bending
of the ∠R–H–H angle and are degenerate if the
angle is straight in the TS structure. The full table with all frequencies
can be found in the Supporting Information (Table S6). Three of the five TSs have low harmonic frequencies on
the Agrawalla PES of about 100/cm and lower. Their corresponding DFT
frequencies have higher values, greater than 300/cm. DFT frequencies
are certainly the more reliable estimate here, which indicates that
the Agrawalla PES has some deficiencies in reproducing those frequencies.

The value
of the RRHO-TST rate constant kFF is mainly
determined by frequencies and the barrier height
calculated on the ReaxFF/Agrawalla PES. The aforementioned low frequencies
belong to a bending mode, which is limited in its extent to at most
one full turn (0–180°). As explained in the Methods section
along with Figure 3, the HO model, which ranges per definition from −∞
to +∞, may lead to too densely spaced energy levels and overestimate kFF. Thus, the estimation of the anharmonic correction
can be very inaccurate in cases of flat potential bending modes, as
we observed here.

The TS structures of reactions 1 and 2 suffer
from this overestimation
especially, as the low frequencies in Table 2 show. Figure 6 shows the lowest frequency bending mode (that is doubly
degenerate) of the TS for reaction 1. This is a type of failure of
our correction scheme that we discussed along with Figure 3. The PESs at both levels of
theory show a minimum at an angle of 180°. Near 90 and 270°,
the ReaxFF/Agrawalla PES shows minima, which result from the abstracting
hydrogen being attracted to the CH3• radical (while the bending angle is
kept frozen) to become CH4 + H• again.
Beyond, both PESs rise steeper than harmonic. The most severe difference
is in the ReaxFF/Agrawalla PES being extremely flat at the minimum.
According to the HO approximation, an energy of about 13.3 kJ/mol
is required to reach the physical limits of the bending motion. Thus,
most energy levels will contain an unphysical effect that makes them
significantly more densely spaced, thereby raising the entropy of
the TS in the HO approximation at the FF level. The anharmonicity
on the FF level is therefore substantially different than the one
on the QM level and thereby violates requirement (b). As a consequence,
the increased entropy reduces the free-energy barrier height and raises
the FF RRHO-TST rate constant. This artificially raised kFF lowers the corrected reaction rate kcorr according to eq 10 so that it falls below the experimental values.

with circles) and the B2PLYPD3 level (green, dashed line with circles),
zeroed at 180°, and their harmonic approximations [with a frequency
of 70/cm at the ReaxFF level (blue, dashed line) and a frequency of
537/cm at the B2PLYPD3 level (green, dotted line)] used in the respective
RRHO-TST rate constants. The harmonic expansion of the ReaxFF/Agrawalla
PES intersects 0° at 13.3 kJ/mol, below the value for RT (24.9 kJ/mol at 3000 K). Although the bending angle is
limited to 180°, we continue the potentials up to 360° by
turning the dihedral angle, to make them comparable to the HO parabolas.

In contrast to those for the other reactions, the
lowest frequencies
for the TS of reactions 3 and 4 are in good agreement with the DFT
reference. The same is true for the HO frequencies of the reactants
(H2, H2O, and OH). These reactions were considered
essential by Agrawalla and van Duin for the H2/O2 combustion mechanism, so they included the barrier height and reaction
enthalpy of the backward paths in the training process of their ReaxFF
parameterization.64 In consequence, the
PES around the reactants and the TS is well described by the force
field, and the transferability requirement of our method can be considered
valid. In these cases, the ratio kMD/kFF reasonably reflects the anharmonic effects
in the combined rate constant kcorr (see eq 10).

3.2 Effect of Nonrepresentative TSs
Reaction
2f (Figure 4c) even
possesses two very low frequencies in its TS (cf. Table 2). Nevertheless, the corrected
rate constant matches well with experimental46 and computational47 rate constants from
the literature due to fortuitous error cancellation. A closer look
at the PES on FF and QM levels reveals that reaction 2f violates assumption
(b) in both the manners depicted in Figures 2 and 3, which partly
cancel each other out here.

The computed corrected rate constants
for reaction 2 can only partly be compared to literature results due
to the following difference: the product CH22• of reaction 2f exists in singlet
and triplet spin states, a concept that cannot be reflected in the
ReaxFF formalism. Instead, only the lowest-energy spin state configurations
are taken as training input for a parameterization.65 In consequence, the simulated molecules can pass through
energy levels that would in reality belong to different spin states
and require collisions for that transition. From the PES in Figure 9, one can see that,
while the reaction CH3• + H• ⇌ CH22• + H2 is completely
possible on the DFT triplet surface (Figure 8), it is energetically more favorable to
react through smaller, more methane-like C–H–H angle
configurations on the DFT singlet surface (Figure 7), thereby circumventing the barrier at (ϕC–H–H, rH–H) = (180°, 0.9 Å). The possibility of this process will
strongly depend on collisions that allow travel between both surfaces
and, on the other hand, can stabilize the CH4 complex in
the methane configuration at (ϕC–H–H, rH–H) = (35°, 1.7 Å)
(Figures 8 and 9).

Figure 7 Singlet PES of CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 (reaction
2). All other coordinates were optimized at the B2PYLPD3/6-311++g(d,p)
level, which yields the reported energies.

PES of CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 (reaction

level, which yields the reported energies.

Figure 9 Combination
of CH4 singlet and triplet potential energies.
At each point, the lowest energy of both spin states is taken. Above
the black line, triplet energies are lower than singlet energies;
below, vice versa. Dark atoms are carbon; light atoms are hydrogen.
The C–H–H angle was scanned in 10° steps and the
H–H bond distance in 0.1 Å steps. All other coordinates
were optimized at the B2PYLPD3/6-311++g(d,p) level, which yields the
reported energies.

Rate constants for collisional
conversion of 1CH21• + M → 3CH22• + M are
on the order of 6 × 1011 cm/(mol3 s) and
are only slightly temperature-dependent.66,67 This reaction is therefore considerably faster than some other unimolecular
processes, for example, dissociation of C•H3. In such cases, it is a good approximation to use the minimum-energy-PES
including both spin states of the CH2 species.

The
CTY analysis counts both spin states as the product of the
reaction. In turn, Baulch et al.46 (and
the experiments where their recommendation is based on refs (43, 68, 69)) explicitly consider the singlet
state. However, Ge et al.47 list reaction
2f as a reaction that possesses a TS; while they do not specify the
spin state used, a well-defined TS is present only on the triplet
surface. Therefore, their rate constant should refer only to triplet
CH2. This makes the overall rate constant for CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 (that we obtain from
MD) larger than state-selective rate constants from the literature.

Figure 10 shows
the empirical PES of the same reaction calculated with ReaxFF and
Agrawalla’s parameterization. In general, energies are lower
than predicted by the ab initio method (therefore, the picture is
bluer; we use the same color scale for all four PES plots). The TS
of the predicted path is visible at (ϕC–H–H, rH–H) ≈ (180°, 1.1
Å) and corresponds to the DFT TS in the triplet state. However,
clearly, there are additional, potentially barrierless pathways via
the much more attractive CH4 basin that accelerate the
reaction in the simulations. Four representative trajectories extracted
from our simulations are depicted. While two are passing the TS at
(180°, 1.1 Å), the other two run through the low-energy
singlet basin. Movies of these trajectories are attached in the SI. Our correction scheme under assumption (b)
would lower the barrier heights for the TS on the triplet PES part
and the actual bottleneck on the singlet PES part differently: the
actual barrier through which most trajectories pass can be seen in Figure 10. The bottleneck
on the FF PES occurs approximately at (ϕC–H–H, rH–H) = (80°, 0.9 Å).
The energy difference of the triplet TS at (180°, 1.0 Å)
to the actual bottleneck amounts at the FF level to ≈49 kJ/mol,
while at the QM level (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pvtz), it amounts to ≈227
kJ/mol. Note that the energy at the QM level rises steeply near that
bottleneck (cf. the dense isoenergy lines in Figure 7) because that exit channel is barrierless
here. All in all, the correction obtained by our scheme can be very
different from the energies actually present near the exit channel.
This corresponds to the type of failure of our correction scheme discussed
in Figure 2. Nevertheless,
the Figure 3-type failure
partly compensates for the Figure 2-type failure so that in total fortuitous error cancellation
leads to good agreement with literature rate constants shown in Figure 4c. The anharmonic
PES at the FF level reproduces the anharmonicity of the combined QM
PES better than the triplet PES; therefore, in total, despite the
ReaxFF results being faster than the experimental results, the correction
scheme works.

Figure 10 CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 ReaxFF PES with the
predicted TS at (ϕC–H–H, rH–H) = (180°, 1.1 Å). Approximate isosurfaces
are depicted where the bond order is 0.5 for the nearer (black, solid
line) and the farther hydrogen (black, dashed line). Representative
trajectories are given as examples: two taking the path via the TS
(red circle and red cross) and two taking the lower-energy channel
via the CH4 singlet basin (red triangle and red plus).
Illustrating videos are available in the Supporting Information. The trajectories do not follow minimum-energy
path lines because of their kinetic energy; this can best be seen
in the videos.

We have thereby identified two
weaknesses of FFs that can spoil
anharmonicity corrections from MD: On the one hand, when frequencies
are reproduced so badly that the harmonic approximation applies to
unphysical regions, the harmonic model of the higher-quality PES cannot
correct for the lower-quality PES; on the other hand, ab initio calculations
are performed for a specific spin state. If the FF combines data from
different spin states, a reaction on that PES may not have a corresponding
TS on the ab initio PES, so this pathway cannot be included in the
computation of the corrected rate constant. It is therefore desirable
that future FFs are also trained to capture the main features of QM
PESs, especially with respect to low frequencies and general anharmonic
trends in spirit of Figure 1. When reactions 1 and 2 are excluded from the comparison,
rate constants corrected by our scheme deviate from experimental rate
constants on average a factor of 2.1 (cf. Table S3).

3.3 Application to Larger Reactant
Species
From the methane system, we only discussed reactions
with H• radicals (and with H2 in the
reverse reactions). Atomic
reaction partners lose three DoFs when becoming part of the TS. 2-atomic
species and linear species lose five and all other species lose six
DoFs. These DoFs appear in the TS as so-called “transitional
modes” because they are not part of the internal DoFs of reactants
but have been rotational and translational DoFs.62,63 One stretch and two bends arise as transitional modes in TSs with
H• radicals. Larger reactant radicals like O•H or HO2• radicals also introduce one or two HRs.

Anharmonicity
in bending motions tends to make the potential steeper than a harmonic
one; cf. Figure 6.
Therefore, in all reactions from the methane system under study, the
inclusion of anharmonicity reduces the rate constants obtained from
a harmonic treatment. From reactions of larger species, it is known
that the inclusion of anharmonicity usually increases rate constants
from harmonic calculations. TSs of such reactions contain HRs where
the potential often quickly becomes broader than harmonic. We performed
a MD simulation for 2-butanone + HO2• to test that our correction in such
cases increases the rate constant compared to the harmonic treatment.

Reaction rate constants for 2-butanone + HO2• abstraction from the primary/α-site
are shown in Figure 11. Here, one can see that, for this larger species, anharmonic corrections
from the MD rate increase the rate constant inferred from TST corrections.
Therefore, the MD rate constant is higher than the FF–TST rate
constant. However, the overall correction obtained, including high-level
barrier height and frequency corrections, lowers the MD constant because
the QM-based TST rate constant is lower than the FF–TST rate
constant. The correction is rather high, which one would expect for
larger reacting systems.9,10

4 Conclusions
We presented a new method to
obtain fully anharmonic and quantum-mechanical
rate constants by combining efficient computations. A MD rate constant
was used to include anharmonic effects, and a DFT/Coupled-Cluster
RRHO-TST rate constant was used to include quantum effects. The combination
scheme required a third RRHO-TST rate constant calculated from the
PES that was used for MD. For that, we implemented algorithms to compute
the Hessian, to optimize TSs, and to perform IRC calculations. Two
assumptions were used and tested: (a) The Pitzer–Gwinn approximation
was used to correct the classical MD rate constants for quantum effects.
This approximation was applicable at all conditions used in our study.
(b) Anharmonicity was transferable along PESs of different qualities.
We identified the following ratio to be crucial (cf. eq 11) 12  We also showed a case, the CH3• + H• → CH22• + H2 reaction, where deficiencies
in fulfilling the second assumption partly canceled. That reaction
may proceed along two potential energy surfaces (singlet and triplet),
which allows trajectories to pass a lower-energy, barrierless channel.
The ReaxFF force field by Agrawalla that we used was not parameterized
for reproducing HO frequencies, which resulted in inaccuracies when
using them for TST and deteriorated results for the CH4 + H• → CH3• + H2 reaction. Our test
set of reactions included two examples whose reaction enthalpies and
barrier heights were actually part of the training set for the MD
force field parameterization. Only those yielded acceptable HO frequencies
and RRHO-TST rate constants among the studied reactions, as the comparison
to DFT/Coupled-Cluster showed. Nevertheless, our correction scheme
led to improved rate constant predictions in most cases. In total,
the rate constants corrected by our scheme shows a standard deviation
of 2.6 from experimental benchmark values and of 2.1 if the reactions
1 and 2, where TS show very low frequencies, are neglected. We expect
the accuracy of our method to scale with the accuracy of the force
field employed, especially when it is trained to reproduce harmonic
frequencies. So far, we have not yet found any particular reaction
class where the method generally works better or worse than for others.
Calculations for the 2-butanone + HO2• system show the applicability to larger
systems.

5 Methodology
In this section, we describe
how the rate constants of eqs 6–8 can be determined. It is important
to note that they arise
from multiple PESs: a low-level PES that is suitable for rapid gradient
and energy evaluations in a trajectory of a MD simulation, and a high-level
PES that is suitable for accurate geometry optimization and single-point
energy calculation. The low-level PES used for kFF needs to be the same one as used for the MD simulation (kMD) so that it reproduces the barrier height
ΔEFF experienced by the reaction
trajectory, which makes the exponential terms in eq 9 vanish. The high-level calculations are used
to obtain an accurate RRHO-TST rate constant, kQM.

5.1 MD Simulation Details
For the validation
of our method, we chose a stoichiometric CH4/O2 mixture as a representative chemical system for combustion. The
mixture was simulated with the software package LAMMPS70 using the ReaxFF71 reactive FF and the parameterization of Agrawalla and van Duin.64 This parameter set was developed to describe
H2/O2 combustion chemistry of small species
and is based on an earlier parameterization for hydrocarbon combustion.65 Both parameter sets were trained against ZPE-corrected
energies.71

The MD simulations were
carried out at three temperatures of 2600, 3000, and 3400 K in a fixed-size
periodic box containing 90 atoms at an initial (ideal gas) density
of 1000 mol/m3. A Nosé–Hoover thermostat72,73 with a damping constant of 10 fs controlled the temperature to provide
a canonical ensemble (NVT). We chose hot and dense
conditions to accelerate reactions and to capture most of the high-temperature
kinetics at a short time scale. Going to even higher temperatures,
however, would cause reactions to go off too fast after the simulation
start, effectively violating the equilibrium assumption of TST (g ≠ 1 in eq 1). The initial (ideal gas) pressures were well beyond 200
bar to make sure that high-pressure limit rate constants were obtained
throughout the duration of the simulation. We started 20 replicas
of each box to reduce statistical errors in the rate constant computation
and ran them for 10 ns with an integration time step of 0.1 fs.

For the 2-butanone and HO2 system described in Section 3.3, we set up
a fixed-size periodic box containing 11 butanone molecules and one
HO2 molecule (292 atoms) at an initial (ideal gas) density
of 1000 mol/m3. We chose a temperature of 1600 K, as higher
temperatures favor pyrolysis of the butanone instead of the anticipated
H-abstraction. We ran four replicas for 2 ns. All other MD simulation
parameters of the butanone system were identical to those used for
the methane system.

5.2 MD Rate Constants kMD
Reactive events in the MD simulation
were evaluated with
the CTY software,23,24 which processes the MD trajectory
in small time slices and tracks the change of chemical composition
based on broken and formed bonds. This way, it can compute rate constants
for each observed reaction based on the number of reaction events
and the current concentration of reactants.

Upper and lower
boundaries of the MD rate constants presented in Figures 4a–f and 5a–d are obtained from a statistical analysis of the
reaction events, assuming a Poisson distribution and using a confidence
interval of 95% according to Kröger et al.61 These boundaries solely account for the statistical uncertainty
due to a finite number of observed reaction events.

5.3 RRHO-TST Rate Constants kFF
To calculate kFF, we need frequencies
and stationary point geometries on the FF PES.
For that, we implemented a geometry optimizer to find stationary points
on the low-level PES. The optimizer employs a simple eigenvector following
algorithm74 to walk along the PES. We also
implemented a numerical, mass-weighted Hessian calculation to retrieve
vibrational frequencies at the stationary points (minima and TSs).
The Hessian matrix was computed by a finite differences scheme where
we found a displacement of 1 × 10–5 Å
to yield the best trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability.

Both implementations interface to the MD-software LAMMPS70 and its built-in ReaxFF implementation75 to retrieve gradients and energy for a given
geometry, and both make use of the NumPy library76 and the openbabel library.77 Optimization results and normal modes were screened for plausibility
with the visualization tool OVITO.78 The
found TSs were validated by following the mass-weighted path on the
PES along the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) according to the
algorithm described by Ishida et al.79

The actual RRHO-TST rate constants for the necessary temperatures
were calculated by the TAMkin software80 using the results of the optimization and frequency calculations.
To match the classical PES of the MD simulation, the vibrational partition
function was evaluated classically, and the zero-point correction
was excluded from the barrier height (ΔEFF).

5.4 RRHO-TST Rate Constants kQM
All QM calculations were carried
out with
the software Gaussian.81 Optimized geometries
and frequencies were computed with B2PLYP-D3BJ82,83 double-hybrid DFT and the 6-311++G(d,p) basis set using “verytight”
convergence settings. It is common practice to use frequency scaling
factors to account for systematic biases of electronic structure methods
and the harmonic expansion. Different scaling factors are found for
the reproduction of benchmark harmonic or fundamental frequencies,
ZPEs,84 enthalpies, and entropies.36 The target of the method proposed in this study,
that is, rate and equilibrium constants, is related to Gibbs free
energy. Because scaling factors for enthalpies and entropies are often
very close to unity (in contrast to those for harmonic frequencies
or ZPEs), we use a frequency scaling factor of unity throughout our
study. For single-point energies, we used the coupled-cluster method
CCSD(T)85 together with the basis set aug-cc-pVTZ.
This combination performs particularly well for hydrogen abstraction
reactions (mean error <3 kJ/mol86),
which is the reaction class that we study here. Just like kFF, the actual value for kQM was calculated by TAMkin, where we used the built-in implementation
of the Eckart87 tunneling correction to
retrieve κ in eq 8.
