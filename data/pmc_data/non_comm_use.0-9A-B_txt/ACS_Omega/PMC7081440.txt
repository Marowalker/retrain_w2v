In
recent years, NaFePO4 has been regarded as one of
the most promising cathode materials for next-generation rechargeable
sodium-ion batteries. There is significant interest in the redox processes
of rechargeable batteries for high capacity applications. In this
paper, the redox processes of triphylite-NaFePO4 and maricite-NaFePO4 materials have been analyzed based on first-principles calculations
and analysis of Bader charges. Different from LiFePO4,
anionic (O2–) redox reactions are evidently visible
in NaFePO4. Electronic structures and density of states
are calculated to elaborate the charge transfer and redox reactions
during the desodiation processes. Furthermore, we also calculate the
formation energies of sodium extraction, convex hull, average voltage
plateaus, and volume changes of Na1–x/12FePO4 with different sodium compositions. Deformation
charge density plots and magnetization for NaFePO4 are
also calculated to help understand the redox reaction processes.

1 Introduction
In recent years, rechargeable
lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have
been extensively used in electronic products, including smartphones,
laptop computers, cameras, TVs, and other portable equipment. However,
the development of LIBs is severely restricted by insufficient storage
and uneven distribution of lithium in the earth’s crust.1 Currently, the cathode material used in LIBs
is mainly the transition-metal oxide LiCoO2, which contains
the toxic and expensive cobalt element. Compared to LIBs, sodium-ion
batteries (SIBs) are significantly cheaper since sodium materials
are much more abundant on Earth, which makes SIBs more suitable for
compact batteries and large-scale energy storage. While SIBs also
face hurdles of an unsatisfying rate capability and limited cycling
life caused by the relatively large radius and heavy mass of the Na+ ion,2 layered transition-metal
oxides of SIBs (NaMO2, M = Co, Cr, etc.), as the first
proposed cathode materials for SIBs, have attracted significant attention
over the past decades.3−5 However, NaMO2 electrode materials have
a short life cycle and low thermal stability. Also, the complex reaction
mechanisms of NaMO2 usually result in multiple voltage
plateaus during the charge–discharge processes.6,7 On the other hand, the phosphate polyanion family, including NaFePO4, NaVPO4, Na3V2(PO4)2F3, Na2FePO4F, etc.,
seem to be promising candidates owing to the thermal stability and
relatively high operating potentials.8 The
electrochemical performances of different types of cathode materials
for SIBs are listed in Table 1. Among various cathode materials listed, triphylite- and
maricite-NaFePO4 show the highest practical capacities,
although the layered transition-metal oxides O3-NaFeO2 and
P2-NaCoO2 have the highest theoretical capacities. For
all the materials in Table 1, the average voltages are approximately 3.0 V, expect that
Na2FeSiO4 has a low average voltage of approximately
1.9 V and Na2CoPO4F a high voltage of approximately
4.3 V. In addition, both the triphylite- and maricite-NaFePO4 have good capacity retentions, as compared to other materials in Table 1. In comparison with
classical cathode-material LiFePO4, NaFePO4 in
SIBs, as the sodium analogue of LiFePO4, has the highest
theoretical capacity of 155 mA h/g among the phosphate polyanion cathode
materials.17−20 Meanwhile, iron-based sodium phosphates are cost-effective and environmentally
friendly.21 Unlike LiFePO4,
the NaFePO4 analogue exists in two distinct polymorphs
(triphylite and maricite). Triphylite-NaFePO4 is isostructural
to LiFePO4 and offers a one-dimensional channel delivering
a reversible discharge capacity exceeding 120 mA h/g.20 However, triphylite-NaFePO4 is not the thermodynamically
stable phase and usually obtained from olivine-LiFePO4 through
complicated ion exchange processes.22 Maricite-NaFePO4 can be synthesized by a simple solid-state method and is
the thermodynamically stable phase.12,23 While the
thermodynamically favored maricite-NaFePO4 is commonly
considered as electrochemically inactive due to the lack of Na+-ion diffusion channels.24,25 However, by
reducing dimensions of NaFePO4 to the nanoscale and introducing
a carbon matrix, maricite-NaFePO4 may show admirable electrochemical
performance (145 and 60 mA h/g at 0.2 and 50 C).21

Redox processes
in LIBs/SIBs is under hot discussion. In many cases,
both the transition metals and anions may participate in the charge
compensation during the charging/discharging processes. For reaching
higher capacities, one possibility is to utilize oxygen/sulfur redox.26 Therefore, the loss of charge in O2– (redox) becomes an important aspect for studying the high capacity
of LIB/SIB electrode materials. In recent reports, combined experimental
and theoretical studies of O2– redox processes have
been reviewed.27 Tarascon’s group
demonstrated that the redox activity of oxygen is responsible for
the extra capacity in Na2Ru0.75Sn0.25O3.28 Ke Du and co-workers
reported that Na0.6[Li0.2Mn0.8]O2 shows a high reversible capacity contributed by the oxygen
redox.29 Recent extensive research work
has demonstrated that oxygen anions do participate in the charge compensation
in addition to the cationic redox reactions and investigated anionic
redox activities also widely in the research field for new high-capacity
electrodes.26,30−35 However, as of today, Bader charge calculations and analysis of
charge transfer in NaFePO4 has not yet been well studied.
In this paper, we analyze the Bader charge during the desodiation
processes in order to understand the redox reaction processes in both
maricite-NaFePO4 and triphylite-NaFePO4. In
LiFePO4, charge compensation is only dominated by cationic
Fe2+. Thus, an anionic redox reaction may not expected
in NaFePO4, which has neither abundance of oxygens nor
deficiency of transition-metal cations. However, one of the significant
contribution of this work is that we find that visible anionic (O2–) redox processes exist in NaFePO4 systems,
which is different from LiFePO4. Additionally, electronic
structures and density of states are calculated to elaborate the charge
transfer and redox reactions. We also calculated the voltages, crystal
volume changes, deformation charge densities, and the magnetization
during the desodiation processes to help understand the electrochemical
properties involved.

2 Results and Discussion
Sodium iron phosphate (NaFePO4) has two morphologies,
that is, triphylite-NaFePO4 and maricite-NaFePO4. Both NaFePO4 morphologies crystallize in the orthorhombic
structure with the space group Pnma.20,36 Each unit cell contains four formula units (f.u.), that is, 4 sodium,
4 iron, 4 phosphorus, and 16 oxygen atoms, as shown in Figure 1. By using the DFT calculations,
the structural parameters of NaFePO4 are found to be a = 4.996 Å, b = 6.267 Å, and c = 10.483 Å for triphylite-NaFePO4 and a = 5.087 Å, b = 6.883 Å, and c = 9.102 Å for maricite-NaFePO4, being
in excellent agreement with the experimental values in a deviation
of only 1% (see Table 2). In order to simulate the desodiation processes, supercells are
constructed with the unit cell vectors expanded triple times along
the  direction. Finally, supercells adopted
for the present calculations contain 12 formula units of NaFePO4, which is 84 atoms/supercell.

In each
Na1-x/12FePO4, x represents the number of extracted sodium ions
in the supercells. Although the maricite phase has the same anionic
framework as the triphylite phase, the structural disparity between
triphylite- and maricite-NaFePO4 is noticeable. To be more
specific, Na+ occupied the 4a location
and Fe2+ occupied the 4c location in triphylite-NaFePO4. In contrast, for maricite-NaFePO4, 4a and 4c cation-site occupations are completely reversed,
that is, Fe2+ occupied all 4a sites while
Na+ occupied the 4c location. In triphylite-NaFePO4 (Figure 1a),
the PO4 tetrahedron and FeO6 octahedron form
a type of structure sharing two oxygen atoms accommodated in the same
edge. Analogous to triphylite-LiFePO4, this type of structure
provides a migration path for Na+ along the  direction, which is vital for intercalation
and deintercalation of sodium. In maricite-NaFePO4 (Figure 1b), two adjacent
FeO6 octahedra share edges and form a FeO6 chain.
One PO4 tetrahedron connects three parallel FeO6 chains, which is a major impediment to the migration of sodium ions
along the  direction. Therefore, maricite-NaFePO4 is usually considered as an electrochemically inactive material
on account of lacking feasible diffusion pathways of sodium ions.37,38 However, Kim et al.12 reported that maricite-NaFePO4 can also act as an excellent cathode material for rechargeable
sodium batteries since the sodium extraction/insertion could be reversible
in nanoscale maricite-NaFePO4.

To study the charging/discharging
processes as well as the structural
evolution of the Na1–x/12FePO4 crystal, Na ions are removed one by one in the supercell
(x = 1, 2, 3, ..., 12) from the relaxed structures
(see Figure 1). In
order to search for the most stable structure at each configuration
in the Na1–x/12FePO4 system, 5018 structures (2[C121 + C122 + C123 + C124 + C125 + C126]) should
be taken into consideration. Actually, we need only to calculate about
230 different configurations by considering symmetry operations on
the 5018 structures. Figure 2 plots the formation energies per formula for triphylite-NaFePO4. The formation energy in NaFePO4 can be calculated
by the following formula 1  where E represents
the total DFT cohesive energy per formula unit and x represents the number of removed sodium ions in the supercell. We
build up the corresponding convex hull based on the DFT formation
energies as a function of the Na extraction amount. Vertices of the
convex hull representing the minimal energy are defined as ground
states at each composition. Thus, these minimal energy structures
are considered to be stable intermediate phases that can be generated
during the charging and discharging cycles. Shown in Figure 2a, there are two ground states
existing at x = 2 and x = 4 of triphylite-Na1-x/12FePO4, indicating
that two stable intermediate phases Na0.83FePO4 and Na0.67FePO4 can be observed in the charge
processes, which is in excellent agreement with the results calculated
by Saracibar et al.39

Figure 2 (a) Calculated formation
energies per formula unit as a function
of the Na concentration in triphylite-Na1–x/12FePO4 structures. Ground-state energies form
the convex hull of all the structures. (b) Calculated voltage profile
for triphylite-NaFePO4.

Based on the above convex hull, the average charging voltages for
the triphylite-NaFePO4 system are computed. The formula
for the average voltage during Na-ion extraction from NaFePO4 systems is as follows 2  where x1 and x2 are the
Na compositions
before and after sodium extraction in the host, respectively. E(Na1 – x1Host) and E(Na1 – x2Host) are the total cohesive energies
of the systems before and after desodiation. E(Na)
is the energy of a single sodium atom. Two stable phases in Figure 2a lead to three voltage
plateaus during the desodiation processes in Na1–x/12FePO4 systems, as shown in Figure 2b. The first plateau
of the voltage is 2.83 V corresponding to x = 0–2,
the second voltage is 2.96 V corresponding to x =
2–4, and finally, it is increased to 3.12 V upon full desodiation.
It is worth noting that the simulated voltage plateaus of NaFePO4 are in reasonable agreement with the experimental GITT (i.e.,
galvanostatic intermittent titration technique), which shows two voltage
plateaus of ∼2.89 and ∼3.06 V. However, the GITT does
not show the specific voltage plateau around x =
2, which might be due to the smaller formation energy of the Na0.83FePO4 phase compared with NaFePO4 and Na0.67FePO4 phase reported by Saracibar
et al.39

Volume changes play an indispensable
role during the electrochemical
cycling. Figure 3 shows
the corresponding changes of the unit cell volume at various Na compositions
for maricite-NaFePO4 and triphylite-NaFePO4.
The full-desodiated phase leads to a volume contraction of 14.45 and
12.54% for maricite-NaFePO4 and triphylite-NaFePO4, respectively, which are relatively too large for the application
of NaFePO4 in sodium batteries. Also, these volume changes
are larger than those of LiFePO4 (∼7%).40 The volume decrease of maricite-NaFePO4 is always a little bit larger than that of the triphylite system.
Generally speaking, Na1–x/12FePO4 could be an acceptable cathode material for sodium batteries
when x < 8.

and maricite-Na1–x/12FePO4 during the desodiation
processes.

In order to further understand
the bonding properties of NaFePO4 and the influence of
atomic bonding on the redox processes,
we calculated the deformation charge densities on some important surfaces
based on the optimized structures. Herein, the deformation charge
density is defined as the difference between the total charge density
of the self-consistent system  and the
superposition of the individual
atomic charge density, that is 3  where is the atomic position. The contour plots
of the deformation charge densities, as given in Figure 4, can clearly visualize the
charge transfer between atoms, which can help us analyze the bonding
characteristics of the materials.41,42 The solid
lines in the figure represent the accumulation of charge relative
to independent atoms, while the dashed lines depict the area with
loss of charge. In both the maricite and triphylite-NaFePO4 systems, P–O and Fe–O bonds exhibit strong covalent
and ionic characteristics simultaneously. Figure 4a shows the deformation charge density of
the plane that contains two oxygen atoms surrounding a central phosphorus
atom in a PO4 tetrahedron of maricite-NaFePO4. PO4 always forms a compact tetrahedron, which is composed
of very strong P–O covalent bonds. The situation is similar
in triphylite-NaFePO4 where compact PO4 also
exists. In this case, the deformation charge density of the PO4 tetrahedron in triphylite-NaFePO4 will not be
shown. In Figure 4b,
not only P–O bonds are displayed but also the charge surrounding
sodium ion is exhibited for maricite-NaFePO4. It can be
seen that sodium loses all its valence electrons and becomes an isolated
Na+ ion. Considering the great differences of Fe–O
bonds in maricite-NaFePO4 and triphylite-NaFePO4, we discuss in more detail the deformation charge densities of Fe–O
bonds. In maricite-NaFePO4 (Figure 4c), all the six O ions in octahedral FeO6 share the vertex positions with the surrounding six PO4 tetrahedra. Therefore, as shown in Figure 4c, the four Fe–O bonds are quite similar,
and the angles of O–Fe–O are all close to 90°.
In triphylite-NaFePO4, on the other hand, two oxygen atoms
(i.e., O1 and O2, see Figure 4d) in the FeO6 octahedra share an edge of a PO4 tetrahedron. From Figure 4d, we can see that the bond angles of O–Fe–O
differ significantly, leading to a smaller O–Fe–O angle
for oxygen atoms with edge sharing and large O–Fe–O
angles for the oxygen atoms without edge sharing. Comparing Figure 4c with Figure 4d where the charge density
plot is presented, we can see that the Fe–O1 bonding in triphylite
is stronger than Fe–O1 bonding in maricite, both covalently
and ionically indicated by a larger charge loss (dashed line) around
Fe and much shorter bond length between Fe–O1 (2.09 Å
compared with 2.39 Å) in triphylite.

Å. The electron accumulation is depicted by positive contours
(solid lines), while the electron depletion is represented by negative
contours (dashed lines).

In order to understand
the anionic redox processes in NaFePO4 of sodium-ion batteries,
the Bader charges are calculated
by first-principles calculations. The loss of Bader charge relative
to that of the full-sodiated phase (x = 0) is shown
in Figure 5 as a function
of the composition x in Na1–x/12FePO4. As shown in Figure 5, redox processes are always dominated by
iron ions both in maricite-NaFePO4 and triphylite-NaFePO4 systems. It is worth noting that the redox processes of oxygen
are also obvious during the desodiation processes since the loss of
charge for O is clearly visible. However, the loss of charge from
P is inconspicuous along x = 0 to x = 12 in consistency with the strong electronegativity and difficulty
to lose electrons of P ions. Compared with the well-studied LiFePO4, the situation for NaFePO4 is significantly different.
It is well known that, in LiFePO4, only Fe2+ participates in the charge compensation because the energy levels
of oxygen ions are buried deep below the Fermi level; hence, oxygen
atoms are hardly excited. Therefore, the lithium iron phosphate material
does not exhibit anion redox.43 However,
in both triphylite- and maricite-NaFePO4, the energy levels
(see DOS plots below) of oxygen ions are located near or cross the
Fermi surfaces during the desodiation processes. Such participation
of oxygen ions with the changes of electronic structures during the
desodiation processes results in visible anionic redox processes in
NaFePO4, which is apparently different from the LiFePO4 system. At each composition x, the total
Bader charge per formula unit relative to the full-sodiated state
during the redox processes is shown by solid lines in Figure 6. Once Na+ is removed,
the remaining ions (Fe, P, and O ions) have to contribute one electron
in order to accomplish charge compensation. The dashed line in Figure 6 represents the amount
of electrons required to compensate for the charge loss during the
sodium removal processes. Therefore, the deviation between the solid
and dashed lines indicates the inaccuracy of the Bader charge calculation
method.

Bader charges for triphylite- and maricite-systems, respectively.

sodium
compositions. The blue and red lines represent total Bader charges
for triphylite- and maricite-structures, respectively. The dashed
line represents the corresponding theoretical values required for
the redox compensation.

To further understand
the redox processes in Na1–x/12FePO4, we present in Figure 7 the spin-polarized partial
density of states (PDOS) of the Fe 3d, O 2p, and P 3p states at x = 0, 6, 12 for the triphylite system. The calculated electronic
structures suggest that the full-sodiated phase (x = 0) and full-desodiated phase (x = 12) are semiconductors
with moderately large gaps of 3.54 and 1.66 eV, respectively, while
the intermediate phase (x = 6) is metallic. The large
band gap demonstrates poor electronic conductivity existing in NaFePO4, which can be resolved by carbon coating and low-temperature
synthesis routes.44 At x = 0 (Figure 7a),
we find that there are two noticeable peaks near/below the Fermi surface
in the PDOS plot. Although the peak of Fe is significantly larger
than that of oxygen, however, the peak of oxygen is still visible.
When sodium ions were began to be removed, the electrons on these
two peaks will be oxidized at first. Such a picture is capable of
explaining the loss of electrons not only in Fe prominently but also
in O visibly during the initial redox processes. At the intermediate
phase of x = 6 (Figure 7b), the dominant peak of Fe 3d and the relatively
weak peak of O 2p appear around the Fermi surface. Upon further desodiation,
electrons on the peaks at the Fermi surface will lose. The electronic
states on the Fermi surface again explain the redox behavior of both
Fe and O (see Figure 5). Overall, from both x = 0 and x = 6, we see that both Fe and O ions participate in the redox processes
in which electron loss of Fe is striking while the anionic redox (electron
loss of O) is also noticeable. For the maricite system, the spin-polarized
partial density of states (PDOS) of Fe 3d, O 2p, and P 3p states are
shown in Figure 8.
The PDOS calculations suggest that the systems with x = 0, 11, 12 are all semiconductors with gaps of 3.69, 0.30, and 1.65
eV, respectively. While Na0.08FePO4 (x = 2) is metallic. Similar to the cases in triphylite-NaFePO4, noticeable peaks of PDOS at the Fermi surface are found
for both x = 0 and 1 (Figure 8a,b) where the peaks of Fe 3d are significantly
larger than those of O 2p. The peaks of oxygen at the Fermi surface
indicate that oxygen ions also participate in the initial redox process.
The calculated spin-down band structures corresponding to x = 11 are shown in Figure 9a, helping us understand the contribution of electronic
orbitals to the electrons near the Fermi surface. The Na0.08FePO4 (x = 11) is a direct gap material.
We zoom the two bands around the Fermi level in Figure 9a and show them in Figure 9b. The translucent circles and the dots represent
the contribution of Fe 3d and O 2p to the band, respectively. Although
Fe plays a critical role near the Fermi surface, oxygen still accounts
for a visible proportion, which illustrates the presence of the anionic
redox.

and spin-down contributions are given in the upper and lower panels.

Atomic orbital contributions of Fe 3d and O 2p are shown as pink translucent
circles and blue dots, respectively.

Summarizing, for both the triphylite and maricite systems, we can
hardly see the P 3p peaks in the PDOS plots during the whole desodiation
processes, suggesting that P scarcely participates in the redox processes.
The PDOS plots also indicate that oxygen ions are clearly spin-polarized
in the NaFePO4 systems for all the compositions of x, although O usually does not show spin polarization. For
a wide energy range in PDOS plots, for example, from −5 to
0 eV, peaks of Fe 3d and O 2p show significant overlaps, indicating
that Fe and O orbitals possess strong hybridization. Such an effect
of strong hybridization makes the energy levels of oxygen pushed to
cross the Fermi surface, which explains the reason why oxygen ions
are capable of participating in the anionic redox processes in the
systems studied.

It is widely known that lithium ions diffuse
along the [010] channel
in LiFePO4.38 Similar migration
trajectories exist in thiphylite-NaFePO4. Figure 10a shows the migration pathway
of Na-ion diffusion along the  direction. The energy barrier along this
path is 0.35 eV as shown in Figure 10b, which is in consistency with previously reported
values.38 Compared with LiFePO4, the energy barrier for Na diffusion in triphylite-NaFePO4 is slightly higher (0.29 eV in LiFePO4). Diffusions along
other directions in triphylite-NaFePO4 and all the directions
in maricite-NaFePO4 are difficult since the migration paths
are blocked by polyhedra. For a given FeO6 octahedron,
the five 3d orbitals of Fe split into two sets with eg (double-degenerate
dz2 and dx2 – y2 orbitals) and t2g (triple-degenerate dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals) symmetries. The energy levels of orbitals in
a t2g symmetry are comparatively lower than those of eg. Under the ligand field of sodium iron phosphate, the dxz, dyz, and dxy atomic orbitals of Fe (the t2g set)
are nonbonding, while the dz2 and dx2 – y2 atomic orbitals possess both bonding
(eg) and anti-bonding (eg*) states.45 The electronic configuration of Fe atom is 3d64s2, and Fe atoms will lose their two 4s electrons
in the processes of forming NaFePO4. 3d electrons of Fe
ions will arrange in a high-spin state (HS state).46 Specifically, five d electrons in the 3d orbital of Fe2+ (3d6) will occupy the five spin-up energy levels
in both the t2g and eg bands, while the remaining
single d electron occupies a spin-down energy level in the t2g band, leading to the total magnetization of 4 μB/atom. The spin-down levels are higher than all the five spin-up
levels, as shown in Figure 11a. When Na+ is extracted, Fe2+ participates
in the redox process, which means that Fe2+ ions are oxidized
to Fe3+ ions. The spin-down electron accommodated in the
triple-degenerate t2g bands that are close to the Fermi
level will be lost. The remaining five electrons in the 3d orbital
of Fe3+ still occupy all the spin-up energy levels, leading
to the magnetization of 5 μB/atom. The calculated
magnetic moments of NaFePO4 ( x = 0 and
Fe2+) and FePO4 (x = 12 and
Fe3+) are 3.78 and 4.33 μB, respectively,
which agree well with our theoretical analysis of magnetic moments.
The magnetic moment of iron increases linearly with the sodium removal
processes for both triphylite-NaFePO4 and maricite-NaFePO4. The magnetization of Fe2+ to Fe3+ during
sodium extraction seems to be independent for different Fe ions, which
explains the linear behavior of magnetization in Figure 11b.

3 Conclusions
Anionic redox may provide a larger capacity
for rechargeable batteries,
therefore, the investigation of redox reactions is of great significance.
In this paper, the anionic redox processes of both triphylite-NaFePO4 and maricite-NaFePO4 systems have been depicted
by first-principles calculations of Bader charges. Analysis on the
Bader charge are performed to account for the anionic (O2–) redox processes during the desodiation processes. Results show
that the loss of charge for O ions are noticeable during the entire
desodiation processes in NaFePO4, which is quite different
from LiFePO4 where the loss of charge for O ions is negligible.
However, the decrease of Bader charges on oxygen ions in all the cases
is less than 0.1e/oxygen, which indicates a “weak” anionic
redox reaction in NaFePO4. The role of the anionic redox
reaction in the high capacity of NaFePO4 is also weak.
The electronic density of states is also calculated to elaborate the
charge transfer and redox reactions. Additionally, the formation energies
and convex hull are calculated to construct the average voltage plateaus,
which show three voltage plateaus with different sodium compositions.
The deformation charge densities and magnetization for NaFePO4 have also been discussed to help us understand the redox
reactions.

4 Computational Methods
The present calculations
on the anionic redox processes were performed
by using a first-principles method based on the density functional
theory (DFT), as implemented in the Vienna ab initio simulation package
(VASP).47,48 The VASP is based on the plane-wave basis
and the projector augmented wave (PAW)49 representation. The Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof (PBE)50 exchange-correlation energy functional within
the generalized gradient approximation (GGA)51 is employed in the calculations. To address the on-site Coulombic
interactions in the localized d electrons of Fe ions, the GGA + U
method53 with an additional Hubbard-type
U term (Ueff = U – J; U = 5.3 eV, J = 1 eV
for Fe)52 is applied. The wave functions
are expanded in a plane-wave basis up to a kinetic energy cutoff of
600 eV.54 The convergence of the total
binding energy of the system with respect to the plane-wave kinetic
energy cutoff has been tested. Brillouin-zone integrations were performed
by using k-point sampling mesh generated according
to the Monkhorst-Pack method.55 The atomic
coordinates in the unit cell are fully relaxed in each system until
the forces on all the atoms are smaller than 0.01 eV/Å. Since
the magnetic properties of Fe atoms may have important influences
on the properties of the electronic structures of the materials, spin-polarized
calculations are performed for all the systems. In order to address
reasonably the charge transfer between the ions, which is closely
related to the redox processes in the systems, the detailed exploration
about charge transfer between atoms was made by the analysis of the
calculated Bader charges.
