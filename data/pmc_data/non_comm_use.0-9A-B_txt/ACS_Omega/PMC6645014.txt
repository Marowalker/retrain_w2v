Monolayer TiS2 is the
lightest member of the transition
metal dichalcogenide family with promising applications in energy
storage and conversion systems. The use of TiS2 has been
limited by the lack of rapid characterization of layer numbers via
Raman spectroscopy and its easy oxidation in wet environment. Here,
we demonstrate the layer-number-dependent Raman modes for TiS2. 1T TiS2 presents two characteristics of the
Raman active modes, A1g (out-of-plane) and Eg (in-plane). We identified a characteristic peak frequency shift
of the Eg mode with the layer number and an unexplored
Raman mode at 372 cm–1 whose intensity changes relative
to the A1g mode with the thickness of the TiS2 sheets. These two characteristic features of Raman spectra allow
the determination of layer numbers between 1 and 5 in exfoliated TiS2. Further, we develop a method to produce oxidation-resistant
inks of micron-sized mono- and few-layered TiS2 nanosheets
at concentrations up to 1 mg/mL. These TiS2 inks can be
deposited to form thin films with controllable thickness and nanosheet
density over square centimeter areas. This opens up pathways for a
wider utilization of exfoliated TiS2 toward a range of
applications.

Introduction
Transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) are layered materials,
which have recently attracted great interest because of their tunable
electronic structure with the layer number.1−3 Titanium disulfide
(TiS2) belongs to this family and in its layered bulk form
has attracted interest since the early 1980s as an electrode material
for lithium-ion batteries.4−7 TiS2 crystallizes in an octahedral (1T)
phase, which is energetically more stable compared to its hexagonal
(2H) phase.8 A single triatomic sheet of
TiS2 is formed by a Ti atom layer sandwiched between two
layers of S atoms covalently bonded to the Ti atoms. In its bulk form,
it exhibits a semimetallic behavior, and theoretical calculations
for monolayer TiS2 suggest a similar semimetal behavior
with a small overlap of valence band maximum and conduction band minimum.9 This behavior is strengthened under compressive
strain when the band overlap increases, whereas a small indirect band
gap starts to emerge under tensile strain.9 A further increase of the tensile strain leads to a transition from
indirect to direct band gap,9 with the
direct band gap ranging between 0.383 and 0.389 eV.9 Although experimental measurements have repeatedly demonstrated
the semimetallic behavior of bulk TiS2, the monolayer materials
have exhibited a semiconducting behavior under standard nonstrain
conditions. The discrepancy between the experimental evidence and
the theoretical calculations for monolayer TiS2 has been
attributed to the existence of nonstoichiometric TiS2 (titanium-rich
as being Ti1.023S2).10−12 Atomic defects
may also play a role in shifting the behavior to semiconducting.

Along with two-dimensional (2D) TiS2 nanosheets,13−15 other nanostructured polymorphisms of TiS2, such as nanotubes
and nanospheres,16 have attracted renewed
interest. The interest is primarily driven by their prospective application
in lithium and sulfur batteries17,18 as the theoretical
energy density of the Li–TiS2 couple is 480 W h/kg19 and the theoretical capacity is 239 mA h/g.20 Furthermore, an all-solid-state Li–TiS2 battery exhibited a power density of 1000 W/kg over 50 cycles
with a maximum power density of 1500 W/kg.20

Despite an increasing interest in TiS2, little
is known
about its properties in the mono- or few-layered form. Raman spectroscopy
is a powerful tool in the characterization of TMDs as the vibrational
modes often change position, or relative intensity, as TMDs progress
from bulk to monolayered.21−23 However, the Raman modes change
with the layer number of TiS2 and the electronic band structure
remains relatively unexplored.

Liquid exfoliation of bulk layered
materials is being extensively
used for large-scale production of inks of nanosheets with high concentration
(up to 40 g/L) in organic solvents or water with surfactants.24−26 The results of these exfoliation processes are nanosheets with lateral
size in the submicron range27 and variable
thicknesses ranging from single to few layers. The large lateral size
of the flakes produced, control over thickness, and upscalability
are characteristics of liquid exfoliation and make it advantageous
over the other possible synthesis techniques such as hydrothermal
thermal synthesis, microwave-assisted synthesis, or mechanical exfoliation.28−30 A less investigated liquid-phase exfoliation route, which can produce
high exfoliation yields of mono- and few-layered nanosheets preserving
the lateral size close to 1 μm and larger,2,3 is
a two-step process with a first intercalation phase, followed by exfoliation.
The lateral size of the nanosheets is a critical characteristic as
it affects the electrical conductivity of thin films of restacked
nanosheets. In this process, exfoliation is achieved via lithiation
of layered compounds (either via LiBH4 or via organolithium
compounds),31−35 followed by hydroxylation in water, where the bulk layered compound
splits in its elementary building blocks. However, this exfoliation
route if applied to TiS2 would present significant challenges
for ink production as the presence of water would oxidize TiS2 via hydrolysis, leading to the formation of TiO2.13,36,37

In this
work, we develop a method to produce oxidation-resistant
inks of few-layered TiS2 nanosheets with lateral size greater
than 1 μm and concentration up to 1 mg/mL. We established a
nanosheet thickness–Raman active mode relationship for the
first time, allowing the direct determination of the TiS2 layer number through Raman spectroscopy. These advances pave the
way for the development of electrodes that can utilize the attractive
properties of TiS2.

Results and Discussion
TiS2 nanosheets were produced from bulk TiS2 powder via lithium
borohydride intercalation, followed by exfoliation
and separation in deionized water,33,34 resulting
in a colloidal suspension of highly exfoliated nanosheets (Figure 1a). Controllable
thin-film morphologies, from isolated individual flakes (Figure S1a) to homogeneous thin films (thickness
> 6 nm) (Figure 1b),
were attained through the exploitation of liquid–liquid interfacial
tension between hexane and water.38,39

for a given optical contrast—Figure S1; and (e) TiS2 nanosheet lateral size separated by a number
of layers as determined by OM (distribution is the percentage of flakes
of a given layer number that falls within the lateral size regime).

Exciton peaks are not observed
for monolayer TiS2 because
of its semimetallic band structure, which means that UV–vis
spectroscopy cannot be used to quantitatively track the lateral size
and layer number of the nanosheets as it is the case for semiconducting
group VI TMDs.24,40 Thus, more arduous atomic force
and optical microscopies along with dynamic light scattering (DLS)
were used to characterize the exfoliation quality. The thinnest flakes
(Figures 1c and S1b,c) showed a consistent 2 nm height profile
in atomic force microscopy (AFM), ascribed to a monolayer of TiS2 when tip/sample interactions are accounted for.41 Optical microscopy (OM) combined with contrast
analysis (Figures 1d,e and S1a) demonstrated a distribution
between one and six triatomic layers, centered at 3 layer thickness
(Figure 1d,e). The
related lateral sizes range from 1 to 10 μm, centered ∼3
μm at ∼2–3 layer thickness, with thicker flakes
typically having larger lateral size (Figure 1e).

DLS, corrected for particle shape
effects, corroborated the size
distribution obtained by OM,42 while showing
a large distribution of submicron nanosheets that cannot be seen optically
(Figure S2). From a combination of AFM,
OM, and DLS, we can conclude that at least 13% of the stabilized nanosheets
are monolayers, with a lateral size on the micrometer scale. A micrometer
lateral size is crucial in order to fully characterize and utilize
the properties of 2D layered materials.43

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Figure 2) shows a crumpled, well-exfoliated,
monolayer nanosheet with a lateral size of ∼4 μm and
high crystal quality. In the bright-field TEM, TiS2 nanosheets
provide very faint phase contrast and become visible only at a sufficiently
large defocus, indicating their ultrathin nature and supporting the
OM and DLS analyses. The lattice spacing of 2.99 Å (Figure 2c) matches the predicted
spacing for the (100) planes of 1T-TiS2. The selected area
electron diffraction (SAED) (Figure 2b) along the [001] zone axis clearly shows the lack
of a diffuse amorphous ring and sharp intensities, confirming the
high crystal quality, absence of oxidation, and the monolayer nature
of the flake.44 The combination of AFM,
TEM, OM, and DLS has demonstrated the success of lithium borohydride
exfoliation for TiS2, producing monolayer flakes with a
micrometer lateral size. However, it is highly desirable to expedite
the exfoliation characterization process.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for rapidly
characterizing
the TMD exfoliation because of phonon stiffening in selected vibrational
modes that are correlated with layer numbers.45 1T-TiS2 is predicted to have two Raman active modes consisting
of an in-plane vibrational mode (Eg) at 233 cm–1 and an out-of-plane mode (A1g) at 328 cm–1 and two IR active modes (Eu) at 180 cm–1 and (A2u) at 372 cm–1.46 Raman spectroscopy of both isolated flakes and thin films
using a 532 nm laser revealed three primary peaks, 226 cm–1 (assigned to Eg), 330 cm–1 (assigned
to A1g), and a “shoulder peak” at ∼372
cm–1 (termed Sh herein) (Figure 3a).

Figure 3 Raman spectroscopy of TiS2 nanosheets
deposited on SiO2 (285 nm)/Si substrates via dip-coating
(flake thickness determined
via WiTEC-AFM): (a) spectra with intensity normalized to the A1g peak and attained for different layer numbers using a 532
nm excitation laser (including a representation of A1g and
Eg vibrational modes), dashed line highlighting the minor
change in Eg position with layer numbers; (b) spectra with
intensity normalized to the A1g peak and attained for different
layer numbers using a 633 nm excitation laser; and (c) peak intensity
ratio between the A1g vibrational mode and the shoulder
peak plotted as a function of layer numbers.

Although this peak position coincides with the frequency
of the
A2u mode, it cannot come from this vibrational mode. This
shoulder peak has previously been reported for bulk and nanosheets
of TiS2,47,48 and its origin has been attributed
to defects in TiS2, leading to an excess of interlayer
metal atoms, which in turn causes a stiffening of the phonon modes49,50 (Figure S3). If this holds, the shoulder
peak should appear more pronounced for multilayers versus monolayers.

In order to probe if this stiffening can be used for the determination
of layer numbers, confocal AFM/Raman studies were performed, with
secondary AFM performed using a higher precision instrument as confirmation
of our calibration (Figure S1).41 This technique has allowed for the investigation
of exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets ranging from ∼1 to
6 layers (Figures S4 and S5).

The
Eg peak displays a blue shift from 221 to 228 cm–1 from 1L (layer) to 4L (above which changes become
indistinguishable) (Table S1, Figures S4 and S5) with the vibrational frequency
approaching the Eg position of bulk TiS2 at
233 cm–1.46 The stiffening
of the Eg peak with the layer number is opposite to that
observed for other TMDs.51 The group VI
TMDs most well characterized by Raman spectroscopy are thermodynamically
stable in the 2H crystal structure, and octahedral 1T polymorphs are
often only metastable and decay through energy minimization to 1T′
or Td.52,53 Further, the Raman signal of 1T phase TMDs
is predicted, and observed, to be significantly less intense than
that of 2H phase TMDs of equivalent thickness samples.54 The most commonly studied thermodynamically
stable 1T TMD is TaS2, in which similar shifts in the Eg mode can be observed.55,56 The reason for this
blue shift is not clear, and we hypothesize that the presence of an
excess of Ti intercalated between the nanosheets layers increases
the interlayer interactions, thus stiffening the in-plane Eg mode.57 This explanation is similar to
that reported to cause the shoulder peak.47,48 In contrast, the position of the A1g vibrational mode
does not present a significant trend with layer numbers (Δω
= 3 cm–1, 5L–1L) (Table S1, Figures S4 and S5). The position
of the shoulder peak is constant between 5L and 1L. The combination
of these trends results in a Δω (A1g –
Eg) of 104–108 cm–1 for 5L and
1L TiS2 nanosheets, respectively. Although this trend is
potentially useful, data fitting and interpretation over multiple
flakes are difficult because of the broad full width at half-maximum
(fwhm) and relatively low intensity of the Eg Raman mode.
Therefore, understanding the more intense A1g and shoulder
modes are potentially more useful for the determination of layers.

Probing these more intense modes, we found that the intensity of
the shoulder (Sh) peak at ∼372 cm–1 systematically
increases with respect to the intensity of the A1g mode
with increasing thickness (Figure 3a,c). The peak intensity ratio A1g/S ranges
from 4 (1L) to 1.5 (5–7L) using 532 nm as the excitation wavelength
and from 6.5 (1L) to 5 (4L) using 633 nm (Figure 3c). The relative change and overall intensity
of the shoulder peak are significantly enhanced using a 532 nm laser
as the excitation source compared to a 633 nm laser (Figure 3b); this appears to be due
to the greater activation of the shoulder mode for all thicknesses
using the 532 nm laser. The A1g/S ratio of ∼1.25
found for nanosheets thicker than 5L does not decrease further because
of its undistinguished nature from the bulk material. The relative
increase in the intensity of 372 cm–1 peak with
increasing thickness supports the hypothesis that the 372 cm–1 peak arises from an interlayer vibrational mode which could be due
to excess interlayer metal atoms, causing a stiffening of the phonon.
The fwhm increase with the layer number can be expected as each layer
experiences a different relative load on the vibrational mode with
increasing thickness, causing peak broadening. Raman mapping and AFM
mapping of the same individual nanosheets using the 532 nm laser line
show the consistency of the result across the entire individual nanosheet
areas (Figure S5).

In order to make
the TiS2 nanosheet suspensions viable
for applications, it is crucial to render this material chemically
stable. Indeed, despite the high quality of the produced exfoliated
nanosheets, these are rapidly destabilized by oxidation. Stability
studies of the as-produced exfoliations were performed using both
ζ-potential (ZP) measurements and UV–vis spectroscopy.
The ZP of freshly exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets in water showed
a greater surface charge (−40 mV) compared to the nanosheets
of MoS2 (−35 mV) and WS2 (−35
mV) in colloidal suspensions formed via the same exfoliation method.
This can be attributed to the difference in electronegativity between
S (2.58) and Ti (1.54) in TiS2, which is higher compared
to WS2 and MoS2 [W (2.36) and Mo (2.16)], leading
to a stronger partial negative charge on the S atoms. Despite this
initial stability, the TiS2 suspension color was observed
to convert to gray and then white over the course of 1 week. This
color change was attributed to the local spontaneous conversion of
TiS2 to TiO2 via the formation of intermediate
TiSO species releasing H2S gas as a byproduct of the reaction.13,36,37

UV–vis spectroscopy
shows that the freshly exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets in water
exhibit two main absorption peaks at
294 and 600 nm and a smaller peak at 369 nm. Over a period of 5 days,
the TiS2 nanosheets undergo an initial agglomeration and
precipitation stage, characterized by a decreased absorbance at 600
nm, followed by a blue shift of the 294 nm peak toward 266 nm (Figure 4a). This peak shift
has been attributed to the oxidation of TiS2 to TiO2 as the peak at 266 nm arises from nanoparticles or nanosheets
of TiO2.13,58,59 Furthermore, the decrease in the intensity of the 369 nm peak, which
arises from a transition at the Γ point60 of TiS2, provides further confirmation of the conversion
of TiS2 to TiO2 occurring in the solution. The
600 nm peak arises from an interband transition from near the Fermi
level.60−62 The position of these peaks has been attributed to
the size of the TiS2 nanosheets, with laterally smaller
and thinner nanosheets, resulting in a blue-shifted peak.61

In order to probe the time scale of these
effects, UV–vis
spectroscopy was performed every 5 min on an exfoliation immediately
post production for 24 h (280 cycles) (Figure 4a). This showed that even within a single
day, significant aggregation and oxidation occurred within the solution,
with the 600 nm peak decreasing dramatically in intensity representing
instability in the solution. The 600 nm peak was also found to blue-shift
slightly (611 nm at t = 0; 600 nm at t = 24 h), which is indicative of thinner nanosheets being stabilized
in the solution. Further, there is a clear blue shift in the 294 nm
peak within the first 12 h of measurement, indicating the early formation
of oxide in the solution. This oxidation of TiS2 in water
is well-known, and we have observed the same effect in deoxygenated
and oxygen-containing water. We can hypothesize that water molecules
themselves cause this oxidation rather than dissolved O2. Thus, utilizing the materials in applications is necessary to either
process them to remove the solvent or change the dispersive solvent.

Solvent removal generally occurs upon fabricating thin films of
exfoliated nanosheets.39 Thin films of
TiS2 with a thickness of up to ∼20 nm were produced
by dip-coating (Figure 1b) and had no observable red or blue shifting of any peaks after
5 days in air (Figure 4b), suggesting a good stability. This was confirmed by Raman spectroscopy
on a single flake over 800 min, where no peak corresponding to TiO263 was observed and the A1g/Sh intensity ratio did not change. After being stored for 6 months
in air, the ∼20 nm thick film demonstrated a splitting of the
600 nm peak into two peaks centered at 584 and 644 nm, respectively
(Figure 4b). The splitting
of the interband transition peak exhibiting a strong blue-shifted
signal at 584 nm provides evidence for the stability of mono and few
over multilayered nanosheets. Although the presence of the highly
red-shifted band at 644 nm suggests the retention of the thickest
nanosheets, this dichotomy arises because of self-limiting oxidation
for TMDs. In this case, the thick oxide layer acts as a passivation
layer by preserving the structure of the underlying material.64 Six nanometer thick films were also studied
as a comparison; however, the signal intensity of these films was
too low to analyze. In order to understand this peak splitting, a
thin film of isolated flakes was immersed in water for 12 h. TiO2 anatase Raman modes are observed to appear selectively at
the edges of few-layered and multilayered flakes63 (Figure S6) after this immersion,
indicating that the counterintuitively thicker flakes are more reactive.
This observation supports the UV–vis blue shift of the 600
nm peak for TiS2 exfoliations over 24 h.

Figure 4 UV–vis absorption
spectra of (a) exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets in deoxygenated
water over 5 days and (b) 20 nm thick
films of TiS2 nanosheets (from water exfoliation) recorded
after deposition (“as deposited”), 5 days, and 180 days;
(i) UV–vis spectra recorded over 24 h (1 cycle per 5 min) for
a water suspension of TiS2 immediately post exfoliation;
and (ii) Raman spectra of a TiS2 flake as a thin film over
800 min showing enhanced stability of TiS2 on substrates.

To confirm this effect for the
samples stored in air, X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was used to study the thin films of 6 and 20 nm thickness. For
both films, the position of the (001) peak at day 1 (Figure S7) shows a small increase in the interlayer distance
compared to the bulk powders from 5.67 to 5.69 Å. The increase
in the fwhm of the (001) peak from 0.3° to 0.1° of the bulk
demonstrates a decrease in crystallite size, providing evidence of
our well-exfoliated material. The (001) XRD peak of 6 nm thick films
was unchanged over several weeks. Although the (001) peak of 20 nm
thick films decreased exponentially over time (Figure S5), the shifting to larger interplanar distances also
decreased. This different behavior between thicker and thinner films
can be explained considering the exfoliation process. Recent studies
on the pressure experienced by the molecules trapped in the interlayer
van der Waals forces revealed that pressures up to 1.2 ± 0.3
GPa are generated, which can induce reactions or crystallization of
molecules.65 This suggest that the high
pressure experienced by the H2O, HO–,
and O2 molecules in multilayered systems can provide the
activation energy required for the observed oxidation to occur. This
would also explain the stability of the monolayer nanosheets in comparison
to multilayered nanosheets. Further films of 6 nm thickness were measured
to have a sheet resistance of ∼2 kΩ/square immediately
upon fabrication and after 180 days, demonstrating that thin-film
processing can stabilize restacked TiS2 films of 6 nm or
less in thickness.

In order to retain the advantages of using
the lithium exfoliation
method in preserving a large lateral size of the flakes, we implemented
a solvent exchange procedure whereby the water is replaced with NMP,66 via a gravimetric centrifugation process. UV–vis
absorption spectra of TiS2 nanosheets suspended in NMP
exhibit peaks at 295 and 349 nm as observed in water, which are stable
over time (Figure 5). The interband transition peak (600 nm) is slightly blue-shifted
compared to the water exfoliation (590 nm NMP, 596 nm water) (Table S2) as previously discussed; this blue
shift indicates thinner nanosheets being stabilized in the solution,
thus indicating that by solvent exchange with NMP, we are able to
stabilize mono- and few-layered nanosheets (<3L) while it is less
effective in stabilizing thicker nanosheets (>3L).60,61,67

Figure 5 Lithium-based exfoliation of bulk TiS2 in nanosheets
stabilized via solvent exchange: (a) UV–vis absorption spectrum
of TiS2 nanosheets in 1-methyl-2-pyrollidone (NMP) as-prepared,

TEM image of TiS2 stabilized via solvent exchange (c) as-produced
and (d) after 500 days; and high-magnification imaging of (e) as-produced
and (f) after 500 days (insets: SAED pattern).

The multilayered nanosheets are therefore more likely to
be removed
during a centrifugation cycle where we apply a lower speed to isolate
well-exfoliated nanosheets in the supernatant and remove the precipitate.
Over the course of 14 days, negligible changes in the UV–vis
peak positions are observed, with some decrease in intensity being
attributed to aggregation and precipitation. After 500 days, the NMP–TiS2 suspension showed equivalent peak positions for the 600 nm
peak with a further decrease in intensity because of aggregation.
The lack of oxide peaks supports the formation of stable TiS2 inks in solution over 1 year. These stability results support the
observations of Bissett et al. utilizing NMP for TiS2 stabilization.66 TEM and SAED (Figure 5c,d) of TiS2 suspensions in NMP
show the crystalline nature of the nanosheets and support the UV–vis
spectroscopy observations of no change in the crystal structure over
500 days.

In conclusion, we have exfoliated oxidation-resistant
nanosheets
of TiS2 down to monolayer thicknesses with lateral sizes
up to 4 μm. This technique has allowed us to probe the effect
of layer numbers on the Raman signal of TiS2, providing
a characterization tool for exfoliated material and thin films. Finally,
we have demonstrated that via solvent exchange, it is possible to
prevent the oxidation of TiS2 flakes and to obtain highly
concentrated (>1 mg/mL) inks stable for over 12 months. This study
provides new insights into the exfoliation chemistry of TiS2 and can accelerate the applications of nanosheets of TiS2 from large area electronics to energy storage and energy conversion
devices.

Methods
Lithium Exfoliation
The TiS2 nanosheets
were obtained by the intercalation of lithium ions from LiBH4 into TiS2 powder (99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich, 200 mesh) (eq 1) with a molar ratio of
2.5:1, followed by exfoliation via lithium hydration in water (eq 2) 1   2  

Few- and monolayered TiS2 were isolated from the multilayered
and unexfoliated bulk material
via centrifuging at speeds from 600 to 27 000 rpm (43–80 000g) in a Thermo Scientific Sorvall Lynx 6000 centrifuge.

Deoxygenated water was prepared by bubbling argon through water
for 60 min prior to use. In addition, the water of the as-made suspension
was deoxygenated by argon bubbling for 60 min.

Solvent Exchange
The TiS2 nanosheets were
stabilized in either 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (or 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
hexafluorophosphate) via solvent exchange subsequent to lithium exfoliation.
Immediately after exfoliation with deionized water, the exfoliated
TiS2 was centrifuged at 27 000 rpm for 30 min. The
LiOH-containing supernatant was removed and replaced with either NMP
or BMIM-PF6, and the solution was agitated; this procedure
was repeated five times to ensure the complete removal of water from
the system. After the completion of solvent exchange, the standard
centrifuge protocols were continued.

Dip-Coating
Exfoliated
TiS2 nanosheets were
assembled to form thin films via dip-coating, exploiting the interfacial
tension between hexane and water. Substrates were dipped into a vial
containing 10 mL of deionized water and 1 mL hexane (Sigma-Aldrich),
at pH 2 [controlled by introducing HCl 37% (Sigma-Aldrich)], and 3
mL of exfoliated TiS2 in water suspension with 0.1 mg/mL
of concentration. Continuous films with a thickness from ∼6
nm were obtained via tuning the drawing rate and dwell times.

Characterization
UV–vis spectroscopy was performed
using a LAMBDA 25 UV–vis spectrometer and 1 cm path-length
cuvettes. Scans were performed between 1100 and 250 nm at 2 nm/s with
a spectral resolution of 0.5 nm. UV–vis characterization to
assess the stability of exfoliated TiS2 suspensions was
performed overnight by running one scan every 5 min for 24 h. Low-volume
cuvettes were utilized for stability studies of exfoliated TiS2 nanosheets in BMIM-PF6 samples.

Raman spectroscopy
was performed using a WiTEC Raman-AFM system running Control Four
software. Samples were analyzed on Si/SiO2 substrates using
an 1800 line/mm grating with both 532 and 632 nm lasers. Mapping was
performed using a 300 nm step size with 0.5 s irradiation time per
spectral point.

AFM mapping was performed using WiTEC AFM equipped
with a reflex-coated
arrow cantilever with a NC, 42 N/m spring constant, 285 kHz frequency
tip. AFM mapping was also performed using Asylum MFP 3D AFM in ac
air topography mode using a SiN PPP-NCHR 20 Nanosensor cantilever.
OM was performed via a Zeiss AX10 optical microscope using a 100×
objective. The resulting images were analyzed using ImageJ software
for lateral size sorting and thickness determination. ZP measurements
were obtained using Malvern Zetasizer Nano-Z using folded capillary
cells. Measurements were performed on the TiS2 supernatant
solution subsequently to obtain gravimetric centrifugation. Scanning
electron microscopy analysis of TiS2 films was performed
on a LEO Gemini field emission microscope.

The TEM images and
SAED patterns were acquired using a JEOL JEM-2100F
microscope operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV.

The
XRD patterns of TiS2 films were studied via a PANalytical
X’Pert Pro diffractometer. Scans were performed from 5 to 80°
2θ with a step size of 0.033°. X’Pert Highscore
plus software was used to match the database.
