Prostate cancer (PCa)
is one of the most common malignancies in
men and seriously threatens men’s health. Developing aptamer
probes for PCa cells is of great significance for early diagnosis
and treatment of PCa. This paper reports a classification model for
SELEX-based aptamers, which were obtained with PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8
(highly metastatic tumor cell) as target cells and PCa cell line PCa-3M-2B4
(low metastatic tumor cell) as control cells. On the basis of the
SELEX principle, 100 oligonucleotide sequences from the 3rd round
of SELEX were defined as low affinity and specificity aptamers, and
100 sequences from the 11th round were set as high affinity and specificity
aptamers. Seven molecular descriptors were used for the classification
model, which were calculated from amino acid sequences translated
from DNA aptamer sequences with DNAMAN software. The classification
model based on binary logical regression analysis has prediction accuracies,
sensitivity, and specificity of about 80% for both the training set
and test set. Therefore, it is feasible to calculate molecular descriptors
from amino acid sequence translated from DNA aptamer sequences and
develop a classification model for PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8.

Introduction
Aptamers are short
single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (or RNA) oligonucleotides.
They can fold into distinct two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional
(3D) structures and are capable of binding targets, such as proteins,
cells, and viruses, with high affinity and specificity.1 Compared to natural antibodies, aptamers possess
several advantages in synthesis and modification. In addition, aptamers
are small in sizes and display good binding affinity to targets, which
make them easily penetrate tissue and tumor, and possess fast blood
clearance.2,3

Aptamers are promising in therapeutic
applications, such as cancer
cell detection and diagnostics, as well as in molecular tools in the
areas of anti-infective, anticoagulation, anti-inflammation, antiangiogenesis
antiproliferation, and immune therapies.4,5 DNA aptamers
have been developed for the virus-infected cells, mesenchymal stem
cells, porcine endothelial precursor cells, and live bacterial cells.6,7 At present, an aptamer (brand name Macugen) has been used for the
treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration. In addition,
some aptamers are currently in clinical trials.8

Aptamers can be acquired through an in vitro iterative
selection
process designated as the systematic evolution of ligands by an exponential
enrichment (SELEX) technique.1,3 This is a reiterative
process as follows: the starting oligonucleotide library with approximately
1014–1015 unique sequences is incubated
with the targets of interest by an affinity binding method, the bound
aptamer–target complexes are partitioned from the unbound oligonucleotides,
the unbound oligonucleotides are discarded, the bound aptamers are
eluted in from the targets and amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR), and the amplified aptamers are incubated with the targets in
the next round of SELEX. After several rounds of selection, aptamers
with high affinity and specificity will be obtained.

However,
the above selection processes are lengthy and need relatively
higher consumption in reagents. The quantitative structure–activity
relationship (QSAR) (e.g., pattern recognition model or classification
model) method can reduce aptamer development costs and accelerate
the process of screening candidate sequences. The main objective of
the QSAR methodology is to find a mathematical relationship between
chemical structures and the activity of interest. To accomplish this
purpose, one usually employs a mathematical model (F) 1  Equation 1 correlates experimental activity
values with a set of molecular
descriptors, including physiochemical properties and structural properties
derived from the molecular structures. Once a reliable QSAR model
is developed, this model can be used to predict the activities of
new chemicals. Thus, QSAR can be used to understand the mechanism,
design new compounds, and screen candidates.9 Then, the most-promising candidate may be synthesized for laboratory
testing.

A few groups have carried out QSAR studies for aptamers.
Yu et
al. introduced a classification model for predicting streptavidin-binding
aptamers that may be “low”- or “high”-affinity
aptamers. The model possesses a classification accuracy of 97.98%
for the training set. Furthermore, the prediction fractions of winning
aptamers from the 1st round to the 10th round of SELEX consist of
the enrichment characteristics of aptamer based on SELEX selection.10 In addition, Yu et al. developed another classification
model for the binding affinity of aptamers of hepatocarcinoma cell
line SMMC-7721.11 The classification model
has good statistical qualities with specificity and sensitivity greater
than 80%. For these two classification models,10,11 some molecular descriptors used in the models were calculated from
the loop structures of center sequences. Li et al. analyzed aptamer–target
pairs by applying sequence information from DNA (or RNA) aptamers
and their target proteins. The predictive accuracies of the model
for the training set and the test set are, respectively, 81.34 and
77.41%.12 Musafia et al. introduced a novel
QSAR model for the binding affinity of anti-influenza aptamers. The
model is accurate with regression coefficients R2 being 0.702 for the training set and 0.66 for the test set,
though the descriptors are based on topological structures, which
cannot describe three-dimensional information, such as the electronic
and geometric properties.6

Despite
aptamers having found an increasingly wide utilization,
only a few QSAR studies have been reported. There are two reasons
for this phenomenon. One is that experimental data of aptamers are
insufficient. The other is that accurately calculating molecular descriptors
from aptamers is difficult because of their larger molecular weight.
In this work, we adopt a novel method to calculate molecular descriptors
from aptamers against prostate cancer (PCa) cells that were selected
by our group with the cell-SELEX method and develop a pattern recognition
model for PCa aptamers. PCa is one of the most common cancers nowadays
in men and, as the second leading cause of cancer death, seriously
threatens men’s health.13 A deficiency
of early clinical diagnosis of PCa can lead to an estimated 270 thousand
men dying from PCa in one year in the United States alone.14 The development of aptamer probes for PCa is
urgently required.15−17 This work will help the SEXLEX selection of aptamer
sequences for PCa.

Results and Discussion
Table S1 in the Supporting Information
shows 200 center sequences of candidate aptamer (5′-AGAAGGAAGGAGAGCGACAC-N40-TATCAGTGGTCGGTCGTCAT-3′), with PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8
acting as target cells and PCa cell line PCa-3M-2B4 being the negative
control cells in SELEX selection. Sequence nos. 1–67 and 135–167
were selected from the 3rd round of SELEX, while sequence nos. 68–134
and 168–200 were obtained from the 11th round of selection.
These sequences were randomly divided into two sets: a training set
and a test set. Sequence nos. 1–134 from the training set were
used to build classification models. The remaining sequences (nos.
135–200) in the test set were used for evaluating the predictive
power of classification models. Candidate aptamer sequences in Table 1 were selected from
the 12th round of SELEX selection. These sequences obtained from the
3rd round of SELEX have low affinity and specificity for PCa-3M-1E8
target. Their class labels were defined as 1. The sequences obtained
from the 11th and 12th rounds of SELEX possess high affinity and specificity
for PCa-3M-1E8 target. Their class labels were defined as 2.

After calculating
1000 molecular descriptors for each optimized
amino acid sequence that was translated from DNA aptamer sequences
with DNAMAN software, binary logical regression analysis was performed
for selecting the optimal subset of descriptors, by applying Forward
Wald method in IBM SPSS Statistics 19 for the total data set (200
sequences) in Table S1. Classification
table, variables in the classification models, and their definitions
of molecular descriptors are listed in Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Table 2 shows that only classification model 7 has
accuracies above 80%. Table 3 suggests that all the variables in the classification model
7 possess sig. values smaller than 0.05, which indicate that these
independent variables have meaningful effect on the dependent variable.
Thus, the seven molecular descriptors in classification model 7 were
taken as the optimal descriptor subset and used to develop logical
regression eq 2 from
the training set in Table S1 2  Here, we take the calculation of
probable
value for sequence no. 200 in Table S1 as
an example. Its descriptor values for EED, SVV, CWP, FCO, FOS, FCS, and FNN are, respectively, 1.963, −13.483, 0.139, 28, 2, 3, and 8.
From eq 2, we can obtain P(Y) = 1/(1 + e–0.994) = 0.730. Because the P(Y) is
above 0.5, the class label of sequence no. 200 is “2”.

Subsequently, we adopted eq 2 to predict the class labels of sequences in the test set
in Table S1. The class labels calculated
are listed in Table S1. Besides the statistical
parameter accuracy (=true prediction/(true prediction + false prediction)),
sensitivity (=true positives/(true positive + false negative)) and
specificity (=true negatives/(true negative + false positives)) were
used to describe the characteristics of prediction. The statistical
results from eq 2 are
listed in Table 5,
which shows that the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the
training set and test set are about 80%. Further, eq 2 was used to predict class labels
of sequences in Table 1 from the 12th round of SELEX. The calculation class labels are listed
in Table 1. The prediction
accuracy is 83.3%. Therefore, the prediction results are accurate.

The first descriptor EED (eigenvalue n (=7) from the edge adjacency
matrix weighted by dipole
moment) is an edge adjacency index. EED belongs to topological indices in nature and is calculated from
the edge adjacency matrix of an H-depleted molecule. The square matrix
is symmetric and has a dimension of nBO × nBO (here nBO is the number of bonds of
nonhydrogen atom pairs), whose entries equal one if the bonds are
adjacent and zero for nonadjacent. EED is calculated by applying the dipole moment for edge weighting schemes.
Thus, EED is related to the symmetry of
molecules and polarity and possesses good discrimination among isomers.18

The second descriptor SVV, signal 05/weighted
by van der Waals volume, belongs to 3D molecule representation of
structures based on electron diffraction (3D-MoRSE) descriptors. They
can be calculated with the following expression 3  where Morsw denotes the
scattered electron
intensity, the parameter s means the scattered intensity
of atoms in the different directions varying from 0 to 31, rij represents the distance
between atoms i and j, nAT denotes the number of atoms, and w denotes an atomic
property, including unweighted schemes and weighting properties, such
as van der Waals volume and atomic polarizability. The descriptor SVV describes the scattering of electron intensity
along the van der Waals volume. It can describe molecular similarity/diversity
from three-dimensional structures.18

The third descriptor, CWP, is the 3rd
component symmetry directional WHIM index/weighted by polarizability.
WHIM descriptors are based on the configuration of atoms in the 3D
space, which is defined by the Cartesian axes (x, y, and z). Molecular principal axes are
evaluated to obtain a unique reference frame. Besides atomic projections
being carried out along their respective principal axes, atomic dispersion
and distribution around the geometric center are calculated. Similarly,
six different weighting schemes (including unweighted schemes, atomic
mass, the van der Waals volume, the Sanderson atomic electronegativity,
the atomic polarizability, and the electrotopological state indices
of Kier and Hall) are taken into account to obtain various WHIM descriptors.
The descriptor CWP not only reflects molecular
size and shape, but also describes molecular symmetry and atom distribution
with respect to invariant reference frames.18

The remaining topological molecular descriptors, FCO (frequency of C–O with the topological distance
being 6), FOS (frequency of O–S
with the distance being 7), FCS (frequency
of C–S with the distance being 9), and FNN (frequency of N–N with the distance being 10), are
binary and frequency atom pairs. In binary atom pairs, the value (1)
or (0), respectively, expresses the presence or absence of a certain
pair of atoms at a specific bond distance. As for the frequency of
atom pairs, each molecular descriptor means the number of atom pairs
that satisfy the above conditions of topological distance.

The
main aim of QSAR studies is to develop correlations of molecular
structures and their properties. However, aptamer structures are related
to the structure of amino acid sequences translated from their corresponding
DNA aptamer sequences. This is the reason why the seven molecular
descriptors present in eq 2 from amino acid sequences can describe the aptamer structures. In
general, the QSAR prediction strategies depend on molecular descriptors
calculated directly from molecular structures. However, our classification
model is related to descriptors through an indirect route. Thus, our
paper is novel and provides a new approach for the QSAR investigations
of aptamers. Especially, this paper indicates that there is a correlation
between the chemical structures of DNA aptamer sequences and amino
acid sequences translated from the former, although this subject may
be complicated. The feasibility of calculating molecular descriptors
from amino acid sequences translated from DNA aptamer sequences and
developing binary logical regression equation for aptamers of PCa
cell line PCa-3M-1E8 has been demonstrated. However, it should be
noted that our method is based on the DNA sequences encoding protein’s
information to realize the prediction for aptamer sequences. However,
the method cannot be used to predict their specific confirmations,
which are correlated with aptamer binding specificity. The reason
is that the specific confirmations of aptamers depend on target properties.
That is to say, an aptamer sequence may possess different confirmations
when it is applied in various fields.

Conclusions
Although
directly calculating molecular descriptors from aptamers
is difficult, the seven molecular descriptors EED,SVV, FCO, CWP, FOS, FCS, and FNN can describe the aptamer structures, which were calculated
from amino acid sequence translated by DNA aptamer sequences with
DNAMAN software. The classification model can be used to recognize
candidate aptamers with high or low affinity and specificity to PCa
cell line PCa-3M-1E8. The prediction accuracies, sensitivity, and
specificity obtained from the training and test sets are about 80%.
Therefore, the prediction results are accurate and acceptable. The
investigation provides a novel approach to calculate descriptors for
aptamer molecules.

Materials and Methods
Cell-SELEX Experimental
Candidate aptamer sequences
used in this paper were selected in our laboratory with the cell-SELEX
technique. The forward primer (FP) labeled with 6-carboxyfluorescein
(FAM) and the biotinylated reverse primer (RP) were, respectively,
5′-FAM-AGAAGGAAGGAGAGCGACAC-3′ and 5′-biotin-ATGACGACCGACCACTGATA-3′,
which were used for the synthesis of the random ssDNA library, 5′-TTGACTTGCCACTGACTACC-(randomized
region with 40 ± 2 nucleotides)-GAAGTCAGTCGGTCGTCATC-3′.
In addition, the primers (FP, 5′-AGAAGGAAGGAGAGCGACAC-3′)
and (RP, 5′-ATGACGACCGACCACTGATA-3′) were applied to
clone and sequence the product sequences. These primer products and
the initial ssDNA pool were purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai,
China) Co., Ltd. PCa cell lines were bought from Shanghai Institute
of Biochemistry and Cell Biology.

PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8 (highly
metastatic tumor cell) was used as target cells for positive selection,
and PCa cell line PCa-3M-2B4 (low metastatic tumor cell) was taken
as the negative control targets during cell-SELEX. The SELEX procedures
are as follows: ssDNA pool (10 nmol) was completely dissolved in 900
μL of binding buffer (obtained from washing buffer with the
concentrations of 1 mg/mL for bovine serum albumin and 0.1 mg/mL for
yeast tRNA) and formed the initial library; incubation of the initial
library with PCa-3M-1E8 cells (1 × 106) was continued
for 1 h on ice on a rotary shaker; the elution of cells from unbound
sequences was performed in triplicate with washing buffer (5 mmol/L
magnesium chloride and 4.5 g/L glucose in phosphate buffer saline);
the bound DNAs were eluted in 500 mL of sterile water at 95 °C
for 10 min and then were amplified with the PCR technique; the products
were isolated by means of streptavidin-coated sepharose beads and
treated with 0.2 mol/L sodium hydroxide. The enriched ssDNA aptamer
pools from each round of SELEX were used for the next round. After
the fourth round of SELEX selection, the counterselection was introduced
to increase the specificity of aptamers, which may differentiate similar
PCa cells. In addition, the incubation and washing conditions were
made stringent gradually to improve aptamer performances and SELEX
screening efficiency. Other SELEX procedure and materials can be found
in References.5,15 After 12 rounds of SELEX selection,
the selection library reached a platform, which was monitored by using
the flow cytometer (FACScalibur, BD Bioscience). The ssDNA pools from
the 3rd and 11th rounds were sequenced by a high-throughput sequencing
device. The resulting pool from the 12th round was sequenced with
the classic method of cloning and sequencing.

According to aptamer
evolutionary principles of SELEX selection,
the binding ability of aptamers increases exponentially during the
first few rounds. Finally, the binding affinity does not increase
obviously or reaches a saturation point. Although a candidate aptamer
appearing in one of the first few rounds does not mean it does not
bind, the sequences from 3rd round and 11th round (see Table S1) are not duplicated in our experiment.
Thus, it is reasonable to define the class labels of ssDNA sequences
obtained from the first few rounds (e.g., from the 1st to 3rd rounds)
of SELEX as 1 and the class labels of sequences from the final rounds
(such as the 11th and 12th rounds) as 2 (here, class labels 1 and
2, respectively, denote aptamer sequences having low and high affinity).
The experimental affinities from aptamer candidates (nos. 1, 2, 4,
and 5 in Table 1) with
PCa cell line PCa-3M-1E8 were tested with a flow cytometer. PCa-3M-1E8
cells (1 × 106) and candidate aptamers in diverse
concentrations were incubated in binding buffer (200 mL) on ice for
30 min. The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd used to describe the affinities was calculated with eq 4. 4  where the parameter C denotes
the concentration of aptamer sequences, the parameter B denotes the aptamer adsorption, and the parameter Bmax expresses the saturated adsorption. The experimental Kd values are 3.24, 2.0, 46.8, and 7.1 nM, which
are in the nanomolar range and acceptable.

Molecular Descriptor Derivation
An important step in
classical QSAR studies is to calculate molecular descriptors. Generally,
the QSAR models are based on molecular descriptors calculated directly
from their respective molecular structure.19−22 However, this approach of calculating
molecular descriptors is only appropriate to small molecules, rather
than macromolecules or larger molecules. For instance, the commerce
soft, Dragon,18 which has been widely used
in molecular descriptor calculation, is not appropriate to aptamers
(typical with 15–45 nucleotides).

Since the nucleotide
sequence of a genome segment encodes the amino acid sequence, the
amino acid sequence indicates the structure information of the corresponding
nucleotide sequence. Thus, the structure descriptors of amino acid
sequence are correlated with that of their corresponding nucleotide
sequence. In this paper, DNA aptamer sequences were translated into
amino acid sequence with DNAMAN software (version 6.0). Then, molecular
structures of amino acid sequences were constructed by ChemBioDraw
Ultra 11.0 in ChemOffice 2008, which were subsequently converted to
3D structures with ChemBio3D Ultra 11.0. The 3D structures of amino
acid sequences were optimized by applying the molecular mechanics
(MM2 force field) method with the convergence criterion of minimum
root-mean-square error of the gradient value reaching 0.42 kJ/(mol
Å). Lastly, the optimized amino acid sequences saved as Sybyl
MOL2 files (*.mol2) were used as the input files for Dragon 6.0 software,18 which can calculate 4885 descriptors for each
molecule. After removing redundant and nonuseful structure descriptors,
which are equal to a constant or have a pair of correlation coefficients
greater than 0.95, 1000 variables remained for descriptor selection.
