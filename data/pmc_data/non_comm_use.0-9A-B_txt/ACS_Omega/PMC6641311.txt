The
single-molecule Raman detection has been realized for a long
time because of the enhancement effect of surface plasmons. However,
the small cross section of Raman optical activity (ROA) makes it so
hard to detect the ROA of even a few molecules; and a normal surface-enhanced
ROA (SE-ROA) is also very time consumable even with strong laser power.
Detecting ROA in an economic way is an important issue. In this paper,
we discuss the ultimate limit of the SE-ROA and provide the enhancement
factor formula for SE-ROA. Following the formula, we proposed a structure
with both huge Raman enhancement and ROA enhancement, which is helpful
for single-molecule ROA detection.

Introduction
The term chirality
is used to describe the object whose mirror
image cannot be made to coincide with itself by simple rotations or
translations. One of the most important consequences of the structural
property is optical activity, which is the phenomenon that the optical
constant characterizing the material is different for left-handed
and right-handed circularly polarized light (LCP and RCP, respectively).
Most of the biomolecules, such as amino acids, many proteins, and
nucleic acids, exhibit optical activity because of their chiral structures.1,2 With the development of technology, many spectroscopic techniques
have been proposed for the determination of the molecular chirality,
such as circular dichroism (CD), optical rotatory dispersion, and
Raman optical activity (ROA) spectroscopy.3,4 Because
the ROA is sensitive to the conformation of molecules, it has been
used to assign the configuration of molecules, study the dynamics
of biomolecules, and so on. However, the ROA of most biomolecules
or other natural chiral media is inherently weak-effected and difficult
to detect because their signal intensities are always 3–5 orders
of magnitude smaller than their parent Raman intensities, which greatly
hampers their wide applications. In recent years, a lot of attention
has been focused on the surface-enhanced Raman optical activity (SE-ROA)
based on the surface plasmon enhancement. It is expected that the
ROA signal of chiral molecules can be dramatically enhanced owing
to the SERS (surface-enhanced Raman scattering)-type enhancement of
the overall scattering and chiral field enhancements, resulting from
large electric field gradients at the metal surface.5−9

The enhancement of ROA signals from plasmon response was first
proposed in the literature by Efrima, which shows that the enhancements
caused by a large evanescent electric field at the metal surface and
the electric field gradient plays a key role in amplifying the ROA
signal.10,11 Recently, Chulhai and Jensen showed that
the field gradient causes significant changes in the SE-ROA spectrum
for the chiral molecules with fixed orientations with respect to the
surface of the nanoparticles.12 Wu et al.
demonstrated that the SE-ROA signal can be strongly enhanced by magnetic
response of nanoparticles;5 however, it
is still difficult in experiments. In the meantime, a large number
of current research studies have been devoted to the optimization
of plasmonic nanostructures for high SERS enhancement and chiral field
enhancement, for example, nanodimers or multiparticle–film
configurations13−16 and shell-isolated nanoparticles,17,18 three-dimensional
(3D) helical nanostructures19−21 or multilayers artificial chiral
structures,22,23 and two-dimensional or planar
nanostructures24−26 to name just a few. Maximizing the SE-ROA enhancement
is a continuous effort focused on the design of corresponding nanostructures
both theoretically and experimentally. When designing the structures,
we should consider both SERS enhancement and chiral field enhancement.
In ref (14), the SERS
is greatly enhanced because of the coupling effect between nanoparticles
and film. At the same time, many works indicated that nanostructures
with 2D planar or 3D geometrical chirality show a high enhancement
of optical chirality, but many of their designs led to both left-
and right-handed near-fields that cancel each other on average, which
makes them not good candidates for chirality enhancement. Recently,
the Schäferling group proposed a geometrically achiral configuration
to generate chiral near-field with linearly polarized light at normal
incidence,27 and then, they theoretically
demonstrated that the near-field with high optical chirality over
an extended region could be generated with a helical structure.28 In 2015, Tian et al. theoretically predicted
that simple Au block dimer structures can provide very uniform chiral
fields with optical chirality in the gaps under linearly polarized
light illumination with polarization off the dimer axis, but the averaged
optical chirality is limited.29

Therefore,
in this work, drawing on insights from the SERS enhancement
factor, we proposed a definition of the SE-ROA enhancement factor
and theoretically investigated that its maximum value stemmed from
the local electromagnetic (EM) field and chiral field. Accordingly,
to demonstrate the accuracy of this definition, we designed a film–particle
system to achieve a high SERS enhancement and a chiral enhancement
factor due to the strong coupling between the surface charge on the
nanoparticle surface and the induced image charge on the film and
then to achieve huge SE-ROA. Furthermore, the distribution of electric
field and surface charge in the film–particle systems is suggested
to explain qualitatively the enhancement of SE-ROA. Also, the influences
from the size of the gold film and block dimer on SE-ROA are investigated.

Results
and Discussion
Enhancement Factor for Surface-Enhanced ROA
As we all
know, the main mechanisms of SERS enhancement are due to local field
enhancement (excitation) and radiation enhancement (re-emission),
and the SERS enhancement factor is approximately proportional to the
|E⃗|4, that is30 1  where E0 is the
electric field intensity of the incident light. Analogously, the local
field enhancement and radiation enhancement are the main causes that
result in the chiral field enhancement. Therefore, we seek a simple
expression to describe the relationship between the SE-ROA enhancement
factor and the EM field. For a chiral material, 2  where G″ is the imaginary
part of the mixed electric–magnetic dipole polarizability (G = G′ + iG″),
which is fixed or has chemical enhancement31 for ROA similar to the chemical enhancement in SERS. Also, thanks
to Lipkin32 and Tang,33 we have a quantitative parameter  to express the chirality
of the EM field.
For circularly polarized light (CPL), , and for linearly polarized light, Clinear = 0. However, with the help of the field
chirality C, once the molecule is in a chiral field,
no matter whether the chiral field is excited by linearly or circularly
polarized light, it exhibits optical activity. 3  where B0 is the magnetic field
intensity of the incident
light. Therefore, for the chiral near field the enhancement factor
is 4  

Similar to the Raman scattering
process,
the power emitted by the chiral molecules dipole p is 5  

which gives the circular dichroism 6  

For Raman shift, the wavelength is not far
from the excitation
wavelength, so the enhancement factor for emission is 7  

The total enhancement factor
for ROA is 8  

When the material has no response for
magnetic field in light frequency,
the enhancement factor is only related to the electric field (in the
following, we only omit the subscript “excit” in Elocal,excit to represent the field at the excitation wavelength). 9  

Therefore, if someone
wants to get SE-ROA, one should have both
enhanced electric field E and chiral near field C (Figure 1). For an enhanced local field E/E0 = 103, EFRaman ≈ 1012, and EFROA ≈ 106. With this
enhancement factor, one can get single-molecule Raman scattering with IRaman ∝ EFRaman × σRaman ≈ 1012 × 10–29 cm2 = 10–17 cm2. However,
for CDROA ∝ EFROA × σRaman ≈ 106 × 10–29 cm2 = 10–23 cm2. Therefore,
basically, one needs 106 times molecules to get a signal
similar to the noise ratio with the same experimental parameters.
With 1000 times laser intensity, like 10 mW, and 100 times integration
time, like 3000 s, one can get a resolvable ROA spectrum of 10 molecules
in ideal condition. In reality, one need to consider if the Raman
scattering is excited resonantly, the ROA cross section of molecules
will increase a lot, which will be good for the measurement. Also,
the most important thing is that all of the discussion above is based
on the assumption of the local field when the molecules are located
in a maximum chiral field, that is 10

dimer. (b) Scheme of a chiral molecule in the hot spot gap of a plasmonic
dimer with chiral near field.

However, in most of the conditions, the dot product of E and B are
decided
by the structures and excitation. However, usually it is also quite
easy to calculate Clocal in numerical
simulations. Thus, the enhancement factor can be written as 11  

Also, because the
local chiral field varies, the formula above
is only usable for single small molecules. If the molecule is very
large, it is usable when the molecule is located in homogeneous chiral
field C. In addition, if the large molecule overlaps
with both positive and negative chiral field C, it
is out of our discussion. Because of the small cross section of optical
activity of the molecules, we usually need many molecules for measurement,
then one should use 12  

The averaged enhancement |⟨Ĉ⟩|
in the literature is usually at orders of ten, and in some conditions,
if one does not consider about the average value, but just focus on
the maximum value of |Ĉ|, it can reach 85.28 However, in this situation, the available hot
site area for SERS of adsorbing molecules is really small and the
SERS enhancement factor is not very large. Therefore, we usually need
uniform strong enhanced chiral near field and strong enhanced EM field.
In the reported |⟨Ĉ⟩| ≈
80 condition, the EFROA ≈ 104, so 108 molecules needed for getting efficient ROA with the same
experimental parameters of single-molecule SERS. However, in a 1000
times laser intensity and 1000 times integrating time measurement,
one still needs around 100 molecules in case the measurement did not
damage any molecules. That is why one needs high concentrations of
molecules, intensive laser, and long time to get surface-enhanced
ROA.

Here, in the discussion, we use ⟨Ĉ⟩ but not the asymmetry factor ⟨ĝ⟩ because we still need to measure SERS with enhancement factor  for many molecules
adsorbed in a volume,
and the strongest area of Ĉ is not always
the strongest .34

As we discussed above, there
are now two missions to get the strongest
enhancement factor for Raman and ROA: first, find a structure that
the strongest enhancement spots of electric field E and chiral near field C are overlapped and, second,
find a structure that has the as stronger averaged chiral near field C as we can. Because the chiral near field is characterized
by the dot product of E and B (C ≈ Im(E*·B)), we expect such structures where the
part of the structure has strong response to incident electric field E and part of the structure has strong response to incident
magnetic field H (shown in Figure 2a). However, there is no such material that
has a rapid magnetic response in light frequency (μr = 1 in light frequency), so now the popular way is to use a plasmonic
material to yield circular current in light frequency to get enhanced
magnetic field (Figure 2b). If one wants to use the incident magnetic field to excite the
structure, the plasmonic material should have an equivalent current
loop surface in the direction of H (Figure 2c). However, in this way, as
well as in Figure 2b, the electric field E and magnetic field H are perpendicular to each other, which makes the dot product C almost zero. This is also the reason that in a lot of
dimer structures, the chiral near field is almost zero at the hot
spots. A solution is to make the current response loop surface in
the direction of electric field E (Figure 2d). This kind of structure
has been realized in spring structures.28 However, the drawbacks of such structures are also obvious: low
electric enhanced field and too complex fabrication.

and magnetic materials that are responding to the electric and magnetic

nanostructure consisting of full plasmonic materials only respond
to the electric component of incident light, which yield strong magnetic
field because of the electric field excitation.

Plasmonic Chiral Enhancement of the Particle–Film System
As we all known, metal nanoparticle aggregates on a gold (or silver)
film substrate can confine more energy in the particle–particle
gaps or the particle–film gaps and make the electric field
enhancement induced by the plasmonic coupling between the nanoparticle
aggregates and the film. However, there is very little knowledge about
the influences of the gold (or silver) film substrate on the optical
chirality. Some time ago, a block dimer structure was proposed with
the linear polarization excitation to obtain chiral near field for
enhancing as shown in Figure 3a.29 In the configuration, the
enhanced electric field has nonperpendicular direction with the incident
magnetic field, which yields the chiral near field. The advantage
of the structure is that it can yield strong uniform chiral near field
with a simple structure and is usable under both CPL and linearly
polarized light excitation, and under linear excitation, the near
field is even stronger. Now, if we put the block dimer structure on
a plasmonic metal film with very narrow gap, the block polarization
will induce imaging dipoles on the film as shown in Figure 3b(i) (larger red solid and
dashed arrows). The block dipole and the imaging dipole will form
a current circular loop (see Figure 4c inset as well), which is equivalent to a magneton
shown as the blue arrow. It is very important to notice that the current
loop will respond to the incident magnetic field as well because of
the gap. The two magnetons which respond in the light frequency range
will yield magnetic field between them as shown in Figure 3b(ii). The yielded magnetic
field is much stronger than the incident magnetic field and can superpose
with the incident field. Also, the angle between the electric field
and the magnetic field is small which makes the dot product even larger
(C ≈ Im(E*·B)). However, because the substrate attracts
most of the electric field close to the film, the enhanced magnetic
field is also concentrated close to the film. Thus, the enhancement
for both electric field E and chiral near field C are not uniform anymore.

Figure 3 (a) Schematic illustration of the near
chiral field yielded in
a plasmonic structure that excited with a linearly polarized light.
The induced electric field in the gap is always perpendicular to the
structure surface and has nonzero dot product with the incident magnetic
field (C ≈ Im(E*·B0)).
(b(i)) Schematic illustration of two plasmonic blocks on top of a
gold film excited by the linearly polarized light. The induced polarization
of the two blocks is shown as the thick red arrows. Because of the
metal film, there are imaginary opposite charge distributions on the
film surface shown as the dashed red arrows. The two sets of arrows
forming two circular current loops, which are equivalent to magnetons.
The electric field in the gap is always perpendicular to the boundaries.
(ii) Schematic illustration of the effect behaved in (i): the two
magnetons will yield magnetic field between the gap, and the magnetic
response can follow the light frequency because of the plasmonic material.
The incident magnetic component H0 can
also interact with the structure because of the gap between the blocks
and the film. The magnetic field in the gap is enhanced as well and
has nonzero dot product with the induced electric field (C ≈ Im(E*·B)).

To further demonstrate the theoretical
analysis above, we designed
an Au block dimer–film system and analyzed with a numerical
method, as shown in Figure 4a,b. The simulations were performed with the system using
the finite element method (FEM, COMSOL Multiphysics 5.0). A Au block
dimer on Au film was located in the x–y plane, the incident light propagated along the z axis, and the linearly polarized light with the polarization
was off the x axis (and y axis)
45°. The length and width of the blocks were set as the same
value w, the thickness of the block and film were
set as h1 and h2, respectively, the gap between the two nanoparticles was set as g and its volume was represented as V0, and the gap between the dimer and the film was set as d, each of which was marked in Figure 4a,b. All calculations were done by assuming
that the structure is in air, and the permittivity of materials was
adopted according to Johnson and Christy’s work.35 As shown in Figure 4c, when excited by linearly polarized light
as shown in Figure 4b, there is a strong resonance peak in the near-infrared region and
two weaker resonance peaks in the visible region. From the surface
charge density distributions (inset of Figure 4c), we can see that there is a strong coupling
between the two particles and between the particles and the film in
the near-infrared region, and the imaging charges on the film and
the charges on the blocks form current loops, which behaves exactly
as we discussed in Figure 3. For the higher order resonances, the EM and optical chirality
enhancements are inconspicuous. Therefore, the optical chirality for
dipole resonance was usable for SE-ROA and focused on the following
studies. Correspondingly, in the resonance peak, the maximum of the
electric field enhancement and chirality enhancement can reach 113
and 2500 at 1 nm above the film in the center of the gap, respectively,
as shown in Figure 4d. Using formulas 1 and 12, we can get EFRaman,max ≈ 1 × 108, EFROA,max ≈ 6 × 106. With the
calculated value above, we know that if we want to get the Raman and
ROA signal of a single molecule at the hot spot, we need 1000 times
laser intensity and 100 times integral time as we discussed before
(10 mW and 3000 s). If the measured molecule is in resonance (surface-enhanced
resonant Raman scattering), it is possible that we use less laser
intensity and less time to get ROA of the single molecule. However,
if we have many molecules between the gap, we can get the Raman and
ROA signal with averaged enhancement factors. In the calculations,
if a few molecules adsorbed randomly on the blocks, because of the
huge enhancement, we only approximately need to consider the volume
of the gap between the two blocks. Meanwhile, the averaged optical
chirality enhancement in the gap of the dimer is larger than that
of in the gap between the dimer and the film, thanks to the uniform
chiral fields (Supporting Information,
Figure S1a), and chiral fields with opposite handedness can be obtained
simply by changing the polarization to the other side of the dimer
axis (Supporting Information, Figure S1b).
The averaged electric field enhancement and averaged optical chirality
enhancement in the configuration can reach 80 and 492 in the gap (V0) of the dimer, which means that we have EFRaman,ave ≈ 4 × 107, EFROA,ave ≈ 2.4 × 105, as shown in Figure 4e. The averaged chiral field
is 1 order of magnitude stronger than the dimer in air because of
the coupling effect from the film (Supporting Information, Figure S1c). If there are tens of molecules in
the gap, with the averaged enhancement value, we need almost the same
condition to get ROA signals (10 mW and 3000 s). Therefore, if we
do perform the experiment in such a structure, it is possible to get
SE-ROA of a few or even single molecules. Compared with the SE-ROA
experiment performed before with high concentrations,36,37 10 mW and 3000 s is not a strict situation with the concentration
of 0.1 nM in experiment (to get only a few molecules adsorbed). In
the discussion above, we of course assumed that the two blocks are
perfect. However, in real experiments, the blocks are not so regular
(no matter whether top-down fabricated or bottom-up synthesized).
In such case, if the irregular protrusion is symmetric related to
the axis of the two blocks, it will not affect the result a lot. However,
if it is asymmetric, then both the electric field and chiral field
intensity will be different for the two linearly polarized light directions.
Thus, there are two effects for the spectrum: the first is that the
two spectra will have a little bit different base line, for which
one just need to align the spectrum base line with one peak without
CD in the experiment for calculating ROA; the second is that for the
peaks with CD information, the intensity difference is related to
the original value, which does not affect the results very seriously
if one does not want the absolute intensity information of ROA. However,
if the molecules are many, the effect is not a problem anymore because
the small field difference will be averaged. In such experiment, even
though there is no CPL shining on the sample, one can still calculate
the enhancement factor. We get the ROA cross section of molecules
from the traditional method with CPL excitation pure molecules. Then,
when calculating the SE-ROA cross section, one just uses the intensity
of the linearly polarized light as a CPL intensity. The other steps
are the same.

It is widely acknowledged that the plasmonic resonance
depends
on the geometry of nanoparticles, and to compare the effect from the
shape of nanostructures, we utilized the sphere dimer instead of the
block dimer, as shown in Figure S1d (Supporting Information), and investigated that the optical chirality enhancement
declines extremely, which is due to a weaker coupling between the
sphere dimer and the film. Thus, the block dimer on the film is focused
on the following section as the optical chirality enhancement system.

Analysis of the Electric Field Enhancement and Optical Chirality
for the Block-Dimer–Film System
To obtain a direct
picture of the optical chirality enhancement and electric field enhancement
in the block dimer–film system proposed above, the electric
field and the optical chirality enhancement distributions of the system
were investigated, as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a–c shows the chiral field (the top panel) and electric field
(the bottom panel) distributions of different cut planes of the dimer–film
system. The x–z slices are
cut from the middle position of the gap between the dimer. The y–z slices are cut along the axis
of the dimer. The x–y slices
are cut with different depths from the upper surface of the dimer.
As shown in Figure 5a, there is a big and uniform optical chirality distribution in the
dimer gap because of the large interaction area with a constant gap
distance, and the optical chirality enhancement increases gradually
with the decreasing distance from the film, and the electric enhancement
of the gap decrease gradually, analogously, as shown in the bottom
panel. As analyzed above, with the distance from the film increasing,
the effect from the film becomes weaker, so the electric field becomes
weaker, which further impacts on the optical chirality enhancement.
As shown in Figure 5b,c, there are obviously stronger optical chirality enhancement at
the gap between the dimer and film, and the chirality field is nonuniform
and chiral both left and right handedness, which makes this gap not
so efficient for applications, and therefore, we only concerned about
the optical chiral of the gap between the dimer. To intuitively observe
the change of the optical chirality enhancement with the distance
from the film, Figure 5d shows the optical chirality and electric field enhancement with
different depths from the upper surface of the dimer. At the same
time, we calculated the electric field and optical chirality enhancement
for a series of points in the middle of gap between the dimer every
5 nm, as shown in Figure S2a,b (Supporting Information). It can be seen that the maximal optical chirality can reach 103 in the bottom, which further demonstrates the feasibility
of EFROA,max.

planes at the dipole resonant wavelength. Corresponding optical chiral
near-field distributions in the x–z plane (a), y–z plane (b) and x–y plane

cut from the middle position of the gap between the dimer. The y–z slices are cut along the axis
of the dimer. The x–y slices
(c) are cut from the middle position of the gap between the dimer
and film and (d) are cut with different depths from the upper surface
of the dimer (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 nm).

Influences of the Parameters of the Block-Dimer–Film
Structure on Optical Chirality
As shown in formula 11, for larger molecules, the SE-ROA enhancement factor
is proportional to the |⟨Ĉ⟩|2. We all know that the structure factors play a great role
in the surface plasmon in metal nanostructures, and thus, their influences
on optical chirality were investigated, as shown in Figure 6. Block dimers with heights
of 20, 30, and 40 nm are studied, with other parameters remaining
unchanged as shown in Figure 4. From Figure 6a, we can see that the volume averaged optical chirality in V0 is the largest with the height of 30 nm. When
the height increases from 20 to 30 nm, the induced current and dipole
moment become stronger, which induces the enhancement of the optical
chirality. However, when the thickness increases further, the induced
electric field in the higher position becomes weaker because of the
screening effect of the metal, and the coupled electric field between
the film and the dimer becomes weaker because of the delay effect,
especially in the upper section of the dimer, and therefore, the optical
chirality in the upper section of the gap becomes weaker and the averaged
optical chirality becomes smaller (Figure S3a in Supporting Information). Meanwhile, we studied the optical
chirality in V0 changed with the thickness
of the film varying from 60 to 100 nm, as shown in Figure 6b. From Figure 6b, it can be seen that the volume averaged
optical chirality increases with the increasing of the thickness.
However, when the thickness increases from 80 to 100 nm, the increasing
of the optical chirality is very limited, because when the film is
thin, there is still coupling effect between two surfaces; when the
film is thicker, it is almost the same as the bulk material (Figure
S3b in Supporting Information). Meanwhile,
the separation distance between the two blocks and the film is a very
important factor for plasmonic resonance. As shown in Figure 6c, when the distance g between
two blocks increases from 4 to 7 nm, the averaged optical chirality
increases initially and then decreases. Because when the g is smaller, the strong coupling between two blocks will tend to
align the electric dipole in one line, which makes the magnetic field
lines have larger angles with the electric field lines. However, when
the g is bigger, the coupling effect between the two blocks becomes
weaker, and thus, the averaged optical chirality reaches maximum when g is 5 nm. The influence from the distance between the dimer
and the film is similar; as shown in Figure 6d, when the dimer comes in contact with the
film, the averaged optical chirality is smaller, because there is
no imaging dipole in the film, which could not form a current circular
loop between the dimer and the film as a magneton. However, when the
gap increases further, the averaged optical chirality also becomes
smaller because of the weaker coupling effect.

chirality. Volume averaged optical chirality in the gap of the dimer

4, 5, 6, and 7 nm) between the two blocks (c) and different gaps (d = 0, 1, 2, and 4 nm) between the dimer and the film (d).

Comparison with CPL Excitation
The mechanism discussed
in Figure 3 is adaptable
for CPL excitation as well, and like the blocks without film in ref (29), here the enhancement
of chiral field C is smaller when excited with CPL; Figure 7 shows the results.
We can see that for CPL, the electric field enhancement is not as
large as linear excitation because, in some period, the E0 direction is perpendicular to the gap. Also, the C enhancement is also smaller. Therefore, linear polarization
excitation is still an option if we want to reach the ultimate limit
of EFROA,max.

Conclusions
In
summary, we discussed the enhancement factor for SE-ROA just
as the enhancement factor in SERS. The direct result shows that the enhancement factor
for SE-ROA is proportional to the enhancement of chiral near field.
Depending on single or many molecules, maximum and averaged values
should be considered. Meanwhile, because the aim is searching for
an ultimate limit of ROA signals for single or a few molecules, electric
field enhancement should be considered as well. A nanostructure consisting
of plasmonic block dimers on Au films was proposed to evaluate the
enhancement and measurement consumption in experiments because of
the huge enhancement factors for both Raman and ROA. The maximum EFSERS is around 1 × 108 V4/m4, and the maximum chiral enhancement Ĉ arrives 2500 which makes the maximum EFSE-ROA 6
× 106. For the measurement of many molecules, the
averaged ⟨EFSERS⟩ is about 4 × 107 V4/m4, and ⟨EFSE-ROA⟩ is about 2.4 × 105. With the enhancement
factors of SERS and SE-ROA, we find that it is possible to obtain
ROA signals of a single molecule. The results proposed in this paper
are helpful for SE-ROA research at a few-molecule level.

Methods
FEM Simulation
All full wave numerical simulations
were done by using the FEM (commercial software package, COMSOL Multiphysics
5.0). The three-dimensional (3D) nanostructures were put on the substrate.
Nonuniform meshes were used for formatting the object. The largest
mesh was set less than λ/6. The perfectly matched layer was
used to minimize the scattering from the outer boundary. The incident
light was set to 1 V/m and propagated along the z axis. The absorption cross sections were obtained by integrating
the Ohmic heating within the nanostructure. The super chiral field
was plotted with Ĉ = C/|CCPL|, where C is defined as  and . The volume-averaged chiral spectra were
obtained using .
