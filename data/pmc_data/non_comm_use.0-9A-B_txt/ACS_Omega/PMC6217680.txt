The study evaluates cellulose nanocrystals
(CNCs) as nanocarriers
for targeted, intracellular delivery of molecular agents. CNCs were
labeled with fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate as an imaging agent
and conjugated to folic acid (FA) as a targeting ligand. The CNC conjugates
were characterized by UV–vis spectroscopy, ζ-potential
analysis, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Cellular
binding/uptake of the FA-conjugated CNCs by KB and MDA-MB-468 cells
was quantified with cellular uptake assays. Internalization of the
particles was confirmed by confocal microscopy. Uptake mechanisms
were determined by inhibition studies with chlorpromazine and genistein.
Binding affinity was qualitatively assessed with a free folate inhibition
assay. Both KB and MDA-MB-468 cells exhibited significant and folate-receptor
specific binding/uptake of FA-conjugated CNCs. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis
was a significant uptake mechanism in both cell types, whereas caveolae-mediated
endocytosis only played a significant role in MDA-MB-468 cells. Uptake
inhibition of FA-conjugated CNCs by KB cells required high concentrations
(>1 mM) of free FA. The observed FR-specific internalization of
FA-conjugated
CNCs by FR-positive cancer cells and tumors and their remarkable high
affinity for the FR demonstrate the great potential of CNCs as novel
nanocarriers for imaging agents and chemotherapeutics in the early
detection and treatment of cancer.

==== Body
Introduction
One of the most promising
applications of nanotechnology is the
selective delivery of molecules to specific cells of the body. This
can be accomplished with novel nanoscale delivery systems in which
selective targeting agents, therapeutic drugs, and/or imaging probes
are conjugated to the surface or encapsulated within the particle.1−4 As one of several targeting strategies, receptor-mediated cell targeting
has become an attractive approach for the early detection and treatment
of cancer in recent years, and many suitable cancer-specific receptors
have been identified.5 Many factors need
to be considered in the design of nanoscale carrier systems for imaging
or therapeutic applications. One must optimize parameters, such as
particle shape, size, surface chemistry, cytotoxicity, and circulation
time.6 Decuzzi et al. investigated optimal
size and shape of nanoparticles for increased circulation time and
accumulation at tumor sites. Spherical particles were shown to be
inefficient because they tend to flow toward the center of blood vessels
with laminar flow, whereas irregularly shaped or high-aspect-ratio
nanoparticles tend to be pushed to the walls of blood vessels, similar
to platelets. This increases the likelihood of nanoparticles entering
tumor tissues through fenestrations in the vasculature.6,7

Cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are elongated nanoparticles
ranging
in average length from 100 to 200 nm and average height from 3 to
5 nm if derived from wood pulp.8 This size
range is expected to be too large for rapid renal clearance yet small
enough for evasion of the mononuclear phagocytic system.9 However, because of their elongated shape, CNCs
can be expected to orient themselves in the direction of blood flow
and eventually pass through glomerular fenestrations in the kidney,
enabling ultimate excretion in the urine.10 Furthermore, their high aspect ratio likely causes increased fenestration
penetration in tumor vasculature compared to spherical particles,
which many carriers are by design,11 e.g.,
liposomes,12−14 metal nanoparticles,15,16 and dendrimers.17,18 The starting material, cellulose, is extremely abundant in nature,
inexpensive, and has excellent strength properties.4,19,20 Additionally, the surface of CNCs contains
multiple hydroxyl groups, which are amenable to chemical modification
for ligand targeting, labeling with imaging probes, and drug conjugating.
Finally, toxicity studies have indicated a lack of or low toxicity
for CNCs.21

Folate receptors (FRs),
mediating cellular uptake of folic acid
(FA), also known as vitamin B9, are overexpressed on the
plasma membrane of many cancer cell types, including breast, ovarian,
lung, kidney, brain, and endometrial cancer, whereas normal tissues
seldom express the FRs.22−27 FA is commonly used as targeting agent for the FR because of its
high affinity. FA is a key vitamin for cell division and is needed
by all cells to proliferate. However, healthy cells can also take
up other forms of folate via the reduced folate carrier and the proton-coupled
folate transporter, which does not actively bind FA.28,29 Overexpression of the FR is essential for rapidly dividing cells,
such as cancer cells.

Development of a noninvasive, inert screening
strategy would greatly
reduce late-stage diagnoses of cancer, minimize unnecessary risk to
patients, and increase chances of survival. According to the American
Cancer Society, the 5 year survival rate for lung cancer increases
from 4 to 54% when diagnosed in early versus late stage. Likewise,
kidney cancer has a 5 year survival rate of 92 versus 12% with early-
and late-stage diagnoses, respectively.30 Currently, cancer screening methods are limited to breast, ovarian,
colorectal, and prostate cancers.31 Since
the FR is overexpressed in many cancer types, targeting strategies
for the FR might enable us to screen for additional cancers, such
as lung, kidney, and brain cancers, whose early detection would be
extremely useful.

In a previous study, we showed that fluorescently
labeled, FA-conjugated
CNCs enable the detection of FR-positive human (DBTRG-05MG, H4) and
rat (C6) brain tumor cells.32 In the study
reported here, we investigated uptake of these particles by KB and
human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-468). We present confocal microscopy
images that unequivocally and for the first time demonstrate internalization
of FA-conjugated CNCs by FR-positive cancer cells. Furthermore, with
a competition assay we show that FA-conjugated CNCs have a remarkably
high affinity for the FR.

Results and Discussion
CNCs were
synthesized from dissolving-grade, bleached wood pulp
and functionalized with fluorescein-5′-isothiocyanate (FITC)
for detection and quantification. The fluorescently labeled CNCs (FITC-CNC)
were subsequently functionalized with FA for FR targeting. Measurements
of the FITC and FA contents by UV–vis spectroscopy yielded
FITC contents of 7.4 and 3.7 wt % for FITC-CNC and the FA-conjugate
(FITC-CNC-FA), respectively, and an FA content of 22.9 wt % for FITC-CNC-FA
(Table 1). ζ-Potential
analysis showed that both FITC-CNC and FITC-CNC-FA had a negative
particle surface charge that was similar to that of unmodified CNCs.
Particle analysis by dynamic light scattering (DLS) revealed that
the hydrodynamic diameters of FITC-CNC and FITC-CNC-FA were larger
than that of unmodified CNCs. However, atomic force microscopy (AFM)
images confirmed that both conjugates still had the initial elongated
morphology (Figure 1).

Figure 1 AFM images of CNCs (A), FITC-CNC (B), and FITC-CNC-FA (C). Images
were recorded in intermittent contact mode under ambient conditions
with tips of less than 10 nm nominal tip radius. Image size is 5 μm
× 5 μm and the z-scale (black to white) is 6 nm.

FR-α expression
by KB and MDA-MB-468 cells was quantified
by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and immunofluorescent staining. KB and MDA-MB-468 cells had significantly
higher levels of FR-α mRNA and protein expression than human
aortic endothelial cells (HAEC), the negative control (Figure S1). FR-α mRNA expression of KB
cells was over 8 million fold higher and that of MDA-MB-468 cells
over 7000-fold higher than FR-α mRNA expression of HAEC (Figure S1a). Little to no expression of FR-α
protein was detected in HAEC, however, KB and MDA-MB-468 cells had
detectable protein expression levels for FR-α (Figure S1b).

Incubation of KB and MDA-MB-468 cells in
the presence of free FITC
or nontargeted FITC-CNC resulted in little to no binding/uptake of
these entities (Figure 2); furthermore, binding/uptake of FITC-CNC was lower than that of
free FITC. FITC molecules (pKa = 4.4)
are known to enter cells in their neutral form by passive diffusion
across the plasma membrane,33 which may
explain the greater uptake of FITC molecules relative to that of the
larger, more hydrophilic, and negatively charged FITC-CNC particles.
Incubation in the presence of FR-targeted FITC-CNC-FA resulted in
significant binding/uptake of the nanoparticles (Figure 2), many times greater (>1000
times that of FITC-CNC) than could be expected from the slightly higher
CNC concentration (99.2 μg/mL for FITC-CNC-FA versus 62.6 μg/mL
for FITC-CNC, particle concentrations were normalized by FITC content).
The fact that FITC-CNC-FA is bound/internalized despite its negative
charge indicates that charge–charge repulsion is sufficiently
suppressed at the ionic strength of the cell culture medium or weaker
than the receptor–ligand affinity.

Figure 2 Cellular binding/uptake
of free FITC (i–iii), FITC-CNC (iv–vi),
and FITC-CNC-FA (vii–ix). KB (A) and MDA-MB-468 (B) cells were
exposed to either free FITC or FITC-CNC conjugates for 2 h, stained
with Alexa Fluor 594, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy. Images
shown in (A) and (B) are representative of cell membrane (i, iv, vii),
bound/uptaken FITC (ii, v, viii), and overlay images (iii, vi, ix)
for each group (n = 4) (bar: 100 μm). Quantitative
analysis of bound/uptaken particles (C). Data shown are means ±
SDs for each group (n = 4) of relative fluorescence
intensity normalized against cell membrane area (*p < 0.05 vs free FITC, #p < 0.05
vs FITC-CNC).

To confirm targeting
specificity, we conducted a competition assay
in which KB cells were incubated in the presence of FITC-CNC-FA and
increasing amounts of free FA. As the free FA concentration increased
to 25 mM, decreasing amounts of FITC-CNC-FA were bound/taken up by
KB cells (Figure 3).
The decrease in binding/uptake of FITC-CNC-FA in the presence of free
FA suggests that FITC-CNC-FA uptake by FR-negative cells will be minimal,
i.e., that FITC-CNC-FA is selective toward FR-positive cells. The
high concentration of free FA that was needed to significantly reduce
FITC-CNC-FA binding/uptake by KB cells is remarkable. Previous studies
showed a significant decrease in binding/uptake of FA conjugates at
free FA concentrations of 1 mM or less.34−38 Here, although the concentration of bound FA in the
culture medium was only 0.07 mM, a free FA concentration of 5 mM caused
a smaller than 40% reduction in FITC-CNC-FA binding/uptake. Nukolova
et al.39 reported a similar observation
for folate-decorated nanogels. It has been suggested that the carboxyl
group (α or γ) used to conjugate folate to other ligands
or particles has a direct effect on the affinity of FA for the FR.
Leamon et al.40 have further suggested
that FR-mediated endocytosis is strongly influenced by the steric
environment around the folate’s 4-aminobenzoic acid moiety.
The apparently high binding affinity of FITC-CNC-FA suggests that
low concentrations are sufficient to achieve significant cellular
uptake in vivo at human serum folate concentrations (9–14 nM).35 Preliminary targeting experiments in a mouse
model (Figure S2) indicated in vivo targeting
efficacy.

Figure 3 Effects of free FA on cellular binding/uptake of FITC-CNC-FA by
KB cells. Cells were exposed to FITC-CNC-FA and increasing concentrations
of FA for 2 h, stained with Alexa Fluor 594, and imaged by fluorescence
microscopy. Data shown are representative images of cell membrane
and bound/uptaken FITC for each group (n = 4) (bar:
100 μm) (A) and means ± SDs for each group (n = 4) of fluorescence intensity normalized against cell membrane
area (B) (*p < 0.05 vs control).

Next, we investigated the mechanism for endocytosis
of the FR-targeted
CNC conjugates. The endocytotic pathway via FR is known to be mediated
by two proteins, clathrin and caveolin.41 KB and MDA-MB-468 cells pretreated with a clathrin inhibitor showed
significantly reduced binding/uptake of FITC-CNC-FA (Figure 4). In MDA-MB-468 cells, binding/uptake
of FITC-CNC-FA was also significantly reduced by a caveolae inhibitor.
These results suggest that the mechanism for FITC-CNC-FA uptake via
the FR is cell-dependent and nonexclusive. Both cell types exhibited
primarily clathrin-mediated endocytosis. However, in MDA-MB-468 cells,
caveolae-mediated endocytosis was also significant. Many studies have
reported cell type-specific dependence on either clathrin or caveolin
for FR-mediated endocytosis.42−44 In our previous study, human
and rat astrocytoma cells (DBTRG-05MG and C6, respectively), which
are non-neuronal brain cells, internalized FITC-CNC-FA primarily via
caveolae-mediated endocytosis, whereas human ganglioma cells (H4),
which are neuronal brain cells, internalized FITC-CNC-FA primarily
via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.32 Suen
et al.45 have suggested that particle size
also plays an important role in the mechanism of FR internalization
triggered by nanoparticle binding. Their data show that nanoparticles
with hydrodynamic diameters of about 50 and 120 nm are internalized
by both caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathways, whereas
larger nanoparticles with a hydrodynamic diameter of around 250 nm
are only internalized by caveolae-mediated endocytosis.46 The fact that clathrin-mediated endocytosis
is observed with FITC-CNC-FA, having a hydrodynamic diameter of about
200 nm, indicates either that the size limit for this uptake mechanism
is above 200 nm or that the size limit depends on cell type.

Figure 4 Effects of
endocytosis inhibitors on cellular binding/uptake of
FITC-CNC-FA. KB (A) and MDA-MB-648 (B) cells were pretreated with
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 5 μg/mL chlorpromazine (clathrin
inhibitor) or 200 μM genistein (caveolae inhibitor) 30 min,
exposed to FITC-CNC-FA in the presence of the inhibitors for 2 h,
stained with Alexa Fluor 594, and imaged by fluorescence microscopy.
(A) and (B) show representative images of cell membrane and bound/uptaken
FITC for each group (n = 4) (bar: 100 μm).
Data shown in (C) are means ± SDs for each group (n = 4) of fluorescence intensity normalized against cell membrane
area (*p < 0.05 vs PBS).

Because of its large depth of field, relative to cell height,
fluorescence
microscopy cannot distinguish between membrane binding and cellular
uptake of nanoparticles. To assess whether FITC-CNC-FA particles are
being internalized by KB and MDA-MB-468 cells, we recorded z-stacks
of KB and MDA-MB-468 cells incubated in the presence of FITC-CNC-FA
with a confocal microscope. Cross-sectional confocal microscopy images
confirmed that in addition to binding externally to the cell membrane,
FITC-CNC-FA are being internalized by FR-positive cancer cells (Figure 5).

overlay of the two channels. Images are representative images of cell

Conclusions
Advances in the biomedical field have led to
the discovery of numerous
nanoscale delivery vehicles. CNCs have characteristics that make them
an excellent choice as a nanocarrier. We have demonstrated that once
conjugated with FA, CNCs are internalized by cells via both clathrin-
and caveolae-dependent, FR-mediated endocytosis pathways. We have
also shown that FA-conjugated CNCs have a remarkably high affinity
for the FR and thus offer highly efficient targeting of FR-positive
cancer cells. The ability of FITC-CNC-FA particles to bind specifically
to the membranes of FR-positive cancer cells, demonstrated in this
and our previous study,32 makes them promising
diagnostic bioimaging agents for the early detection of cancer. Moreover,
the internalization of FITC-CNC-FA particles by FR-positive cancer
cells, proven here for the first time, might enable the selective
intracellular delivery of chemotherapeutic agents to such cells.

Methods
CNC Preparation
and CNC Conjugate Synthesis
CNCs and
CNC conjugates were prepared, as described previously.32 Briefly, a CNC suspension in deionized water
was prepared by hydrolysis of softwood sulfite pulp with 64 wt % sulfuric
acid at 45 °C for 1 h with an acid-to-pulp ratio of 10 mL/g.
FITC was conjugated to the CNCs after amination of the surface hydroxyl
groups with epichlorohydrin and ammonium hydroxide. FA was conjugated
to the FITC-labeled CNCs (FITC-CNC) with 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide
and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide to yield FA-conjugated,
FITC-labeled CNCs (FITC-CNC-FA).

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis absorption
spectra were recorded using dilute suspensions of known concentration
between 0.001 and 0.01 wt % in standard cuvettes, having an optical
path length of 1 cm, with a Thermo Scientific Evolution 300 UV–vis
spectrometer.

ζ-Potential
ζ-potentials
were measured
in triplicate at 25 ± 0.1 °C in the absence of added electrolyte
with a Malvern Zetasizer NanoZS particle analyzer (Malvern Instruments
Ltd., Malvern, U.K.). Samples had a concentration of 0.01 wt % and

NanoZS particle analyzer (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, U.K.).
Samples had a concentration of 0.01 wt % and were analyzed in 12 mm
square glass cuvettes (Malvern PCS 1115) after filtration through
0.45 μm poly(vinylidenefluoride) syringe filters. Reported values

of the Zetasizer Nano 4.2 software.

Atomic Force Microscopy
(AFM)
AFM images were recorded
with an Asylum Research MFP-3D Bio atomic force microscope (Asylum
Research, Santa Barbara, CA). Aqueous suspensions were diluted to
0.001 wt % and sonicated at 150 W for 3 min. Single drops of the suspensions
were placed on freshly cleaved mica surfaces and allowed to dry under
ambient conditions. Samples were scanned in intermittent contact mode
under ambient conditions with Olympus AC160TS tips (nominal tip radius
<10 nm, spring constant 42 N/m).

Cell Culture
HAEC
were grown in Medium 200 supplemented
with low serum growth supplement. KB and MDA-MB-468 cells were grown
in folate-free RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Cells were
grown at 37 °C and 5% CO2. All experiments were conducted
in basal medium.

Real-Time Reverse Transcription-Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)
Total RNA from HAEC, KB, and MDA-MB-468
cells was isolated and
purified using RNeasy Mini Kit according to the protocol of the manufacturer.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan probes and primers were
used for gene expression analyses, as described previously.47 Amplification of individual genes was performed
with Applied Biosystems 7300 real-time PCR system using TaqMan Universal
PCR Master Mix and a standard thermal cycler protocol. TaqMan Gene
Expression Assay Reagents for human FR-α and glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase were used for specific probes and primers
of PCR amplifications. The threshold cycle (CT) was determined,
and relative quantification was calculated by the comparative CT method as described previously.47 PCR results were observed and analyzed using a 7300 Real-time PCR
System and 7300 Real-time PCR System Sequence Detection Software v1.2.3
(Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA).

Fluorescence Microscopy
HAEC, KB, and MDA-MB-468 cells
were seeded onto Lab-Tek Chamber Slide systems coated with AFS and
grown to confluency. Before imaging, cells were washed and mounted
with VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium with or without DAPI. Images
were obtained with a Leica AF6000 fluorescent microscope (Leica Microsystems
Inc., Buffalo Grove, IL). A quantitative comparison of experimental
groups was conducted by measuring the total fluorescence intensity
normalized by cell area using ImageJ software (National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD).

Immunofluorescent Staining
Cells
were washed and fixed
with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. Cells were again washed and blocked
with 3% BSA for 1 h. Cells were then treated with 4 μg/mL goat
poly IgG FR-α primary antibody or goat non IgG antibody in 1%
BSA solution overnight at 4 °C. Cells were thoroughly washed
and treated with 2 μg/mL donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 488 in
1% BSA solution for 2 h at room temperature.

Binding/Uptake Assay
Cells were incubated with FITC,
FITC-CNC, or FITC-CNC-FA at a FITC concentration of 5 μg/mL
for 2 h, corresponding to FITC-CNC and FITC-CNC-FA concentrations
of 67.6 and 135.1 μg/mL, respectively. Cells were washed twice
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and the plasma membranes were
briefly stained with 50 ng/μL of Concanavalin A Alexa Fluor
594 for 2 min. Cells were then fixed with cold ethanol for 1 h.

Free Folate Inhibition Assay
Cells were incubated with
FITC-CNC-FA at a FITC concentration of 5 μg/mL in the presence
of 0, 5, 10, or 25 mM FA for 2 h. Cells were washed twice with PBS,
and the plasma membranes were briefly stained with 50 ng/μL
of Concanavalin A Alexa Fluor 594 for 2 min. Cells were then fixed
with cold ethanol for 1 h.

Binding/Uptake Mechanism Assay
Cells
were pretreated
with PBS, 5 μg/mL chlorpromazine, or 200 μM genistein
for 30 min. Growth medium was replaced with basal medium containing
FITC-CNC-FA at a FITC concentration of 5 μg/mL and either PBS,
5 μg/mL chlorpromazine (clathrin inhibitor), or 200 μM
genistein (caveolae inhibitor). After 2 h of exposure, cells were
washed twice with PBS, and the plasma membranes were briefly stained
with 50 ng/μL of Concanavalin A Alexa Fluor 594 for 2 min. Cells
were then fixed with cold ethanol for 1 h.

Confocal Microscopy
KB and MDA-MB-468 cells were seeded
onto round coverslips coated with AFS and allowed to grow for 24 h
at 37 °C. Cells were incubated with FITC, FITC-CNC, or FITC-CNC-FA
at a FITC concentration of 5 μg/mL for 2 h. Cells were washed
twice with PBS, and the plasma membranes were briefly stained with
50 ng/μL of Concanavalin A Alexa Fluor 633 for 2 min. Cells
were then fixed with cold ethanol for 1 h, washed twice with PBS,
and mounted with VECTASHIELD HardSet Mounting Medium. Images were
obtained using a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning microscope equipped
with argon and helium-neon lasers (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC, Thornwood,
NY). Images were analyzed using ZEN 2011 blue edition software (Carl
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analysis of data
was performed using SigmaPlot 11 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). One-way
analysis of variance was used to compare mean responses among the
treatments. For each endpoint, the treatment means were compared using
the Holm–Sidak method. Statistical probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant.
