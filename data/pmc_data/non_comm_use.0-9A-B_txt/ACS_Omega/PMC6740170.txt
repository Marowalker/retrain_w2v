A new
Rh(III) separation method using metal-containing hydrochloric
acid (HCl) solutions has been developed. This method includes Rh(III)
precipitation with high selectivity using aromatic primary diamines
as precipitants. The compound p-phenylene diamine
dihydrochloride (PPDA) successfully precipitates only Rh(III) from
HCl solutions containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III). Furthermore,
highly selective Rh(III) recovery from the simulated spent catalyst
leach solution, comprising Pd, Pt, Rh, Ce, Al, Ba, Zr, La, and Y in
5 M HCl, was achieved using PPDA. Single-crystal X-ray analysis revealed
that the Rh(III)-containing precipitate using PPDA forms three-dimensional
ionic crystals comprising the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium form of PPDA/chloride anion/H2O at a 1:2:1:2
ratio. Formation of these unique ionic crystals plays a key role in
the highly selective Rh(III) recovery. This Rh(III) recovery method
will be promising for use in the purification process of Rh as well
as the practical Rh recovery from spent catalysts.

==== Body
Introduction
Rhodium (Rh) is one
of the most high-priced metals and a member
of the platinum group metals (PGMs). Currently, Rh is mainly used
in catalysts for automobile exhaust gas along with palladium (Pd)
and platinum (Pt).1−3 Because of the scarcity and high price of PGMs, their
recycling from spent catalysts and electronic scraps is essential
for metal sustainability. However, it is known that separation and
selective recovery of Rh from the mixture of PGMs (such as Pd and
Pt) is quite difficult and still remains a challenging issue.4

In general, PGMs are separated individually
by solvent extraction
from the acid leach liquors of secondary resources.5−19 It is known that the extraction of Pd(II) and/or Pt(IV) from Rh(III)-containing
solutions can be achieved using organic extractants, such as secondary
or tertiary amines,10−12 sulfur-containing compounds,13−15 and organophosphorus
compounds.16−19 This is because the extraction of PGMs occurs in the following order
via the ligand–metal coordination mechanism or ion-pair formation
mechanism.20 The PGMs can be extracted
in the following order Pd(II) ≫ Rh(III) ≫ Pt(IV) via
the ligand-metal coordination mechanism, and the extraction of Rh(III)
and Pt(IV) hardly occurs because of their kinetically inert nature.21 Furthermore, the extraction of chloro-complexes
of PGMs from hydrochloric acid (HCl) solutions via the ion-pair formation
mechanism occurs in the order of [MCl4]2– ≅ [MCl6]2– > [MCl6]3– > aqua species.22 The chloro-complex anions of Pd(II) and Pt(IV), [PdCl4]2– and [PtCl6]2–,
can be extracted, whereas that of Rh(III), [RhCl6]3–, is quite difficult to extract based on ion-pair
formation. Therefore, Rh(III) is generally recovered from the raffinate
after solvent extraction of leach liquors, even in industrial processes,
owing to its inert nature.23 It is widely
recognized that preferential and selective recovery of Rh(III) in
preference to Pd(II) and Pt(IV) is one of the most difficult goals
to achieve.

To date, several separation and recovery methods
of Rh(III) via
solvent extraction have been developed and employed. The extractability
of Rh(III) can be enhanced by the addition of SnCl2.24−28 Tertiary amines and organophosphines can extract Rh(III) from SnCl2-containing HCl solutions, while Pt(IV) is coextracted. As
a selective separation method of Rh, the selective back extraction
of Rh(III) from an organic phase containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III)
into a concentrated HCl solution was reported by Narita et al.29,30 This method requires two steps: extraction of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and
Rh(III) into an organic phase and the back extraction of Rh(III) into
a water phase. However, these Rh(III) separation methods cannot extract
only Rh(III) in preference to Pd(II) and Pt(IV) in one step.

Recently, we have developed a new Rh(III) separation method using
4-alkylanilines as precipitants.31 Selective
precipitation of Rh(III) from HCl solutions containing Pd(II), Pt(IV),
and Rh(III) was successfully achieved based on the formation of a
unique ion-pair composed of [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride ions in a 1:6:3 ratio. This separation method
enabled selective and preferential Rh(III) recovery in preference
to Pd(II) and Pt(IV) in a single precipitation step. However, the
use of 4-alkylanilines as precipitants has a risk for coprecipitation
of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) when the concentrations of Pd(II) and Pt(IV)
are high. This is because the ion-pairs of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) are alkyl-terminated
hydrophobic structures. Therefore, we focused on the use of aromatic
primary diamines as precipitants for Rh(III) selective recovery. It
is expected that the diamines selectively form a three-dimensional
ion-pair network with [RhCl6]3– based
on the abovementioned unique ion-pair formation. On the other hand,
the precipitation of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) is likely to be suppressed
even in high concentrations because the ion-pairs of Pd(II) and Pd(IV)
with diamines are expected to form ammonium-terminated hydrophilic
structures.

Here, we present a highly selective Rh(III) recovery
process from
metal-containing HCl solutions, using aromatic primary diamines as
precipitants. Highly selective Rh(III) separation from HCl solutions
containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) was achieved via selective
formation of Rh(III)-containing precipitates. In addition, this method
enabled the Rh(III)-selective recovery from the simulated spent catalyst
leach solutions containing various types of metals, such as PGMs,
base metals, and lanthanoids. We found that the key to the highly
selective recovery of Rh(III) is the formation of three-dimensional
ionic crystals comprising [RhCl6]3– and
aromatic primary diamines.

Results and Discussion
Rh(III) Precipitation Using
Aromatic Primary Amines
The Rh(III) precipitation experiments
were carried out using Rh(III)-containing
HCl solutions (300 mg/L) and aromatic primary amines. The precipitation
percentages of Rh(III) were evaluated by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) of the supernatant. For this
experiment, we used commercially available diamines: 4,4′-diaminodiphenyl
ether (ODA), 1,4-bis(4-aminophenoxy)benzene (DPOP), and 4,4′-bis(4-aminophenoxy)biphenyl
(DPOBP). Figure 1 shows
the Rh(III) precipitation behaviors according to HCl concentration.
The Rh(III) precipitation percentage increases with an increase in
the HCl concentration, reaching a maximum at approximately 3–5
M HCl. At high HCl concentrations over 6 M HCl, the Rh(III) precipitation
percentages decrease. The increase in the Rh(III) precipitation below
5 M HCl would be caused by the increase in the amount of [RhCl6]3– present in the solutions.31 On the other hand, the decrease in the solubility
of the diamines by common-ion effect prompts the decrease in the Rh(III)
precipitation at high HCl concentrations (e.g., solubility of DPOBP:
0.18 mg/mL in 5 M HCl, 0.10 mg/mL in 8 M HCl). In fact, the precipitation
percentage of Rh(III) using DPOBP in 9 M HCl was improved by increasing
the shaking temperature to 80 °C (38% for rt, 75% for 80 °C, Figure S1). As can be seen in Figure 1, DPOBP showed the best performance
in terms of Rh(III) precipitation among the three diamines. Approximately
90% of Rh(III) was precipitated using DPOBP at 4–6 M HCl concentrations.

Figure 1 The effect
of HCl concentration on Rh(III) precipitation from Rh(III)-containing
HCl solutions (300 mg/L) using (a) ODA, (b) DPOP, and (c) DPOBP (amine/Rh
= 5 mol/mol, 3 h of shaking).

The Rh(III) precipitation experiments were carried out using DPOBP
and 5 M HCl solutions by changing the loading amounts of DPOBP and
the shaking time. The Rh(III) precipitation percentages increased
in proportion to the loading amount, reaching a plateau at a DPOBP/Rh
molar ratio of 4:1 (Figure 2a). Figure 2b shows the shaking time dependence of the Rh(III) precipitation
at a feed ratio of DPOBP/Rh(III) = 5 mol/mol. The Rh(III) precipitation
was completed after 1 h of shaking, and the prolonged shaking did
not induce an increase in the Rh(III) precipitation percentage.

of DPOBP-loading on Rh(III) precipitation (5 M HCl,
Rh(III): 300 mg/L, 3 h of shaking). (b) The effect of shaking time
on Rh(III) precipitation using DPOBP (5 M HCl, Rh(III): 300 mg/L,
DPOBP/Rh = 5 mol/mol).

Rh(III) Separation from
Pd(II) and Pt(II) Using DPOBP
The metal precipitation experiments
from the HCl solutions containing
Rh(III), Pd(II), and Pt(IV) (300 mg/L each) were performed using DPOBP
as a precipitant. Figure 3 shows the relationship between metal precipitation percentages
and HCl concentrations. The Rh(III) precipitation behavior was almost
the same as that from Rh(III)-containing HCl solutions, as shown in Figure 1, indicating that
Pd(II) and Pt(IV) do not disturb the precipitation of Rh(III). Although
a small amount of Pt(IV) was precipitated accompanied by Pd(II) and
Rh(III) at low HCl concentrations less than 3 M, no precipitation
of Pt(IV) occurred at 4–9 M HCl concentrations. On the other
hand, most of the Pd(II) was precipitated at low HCl concentrations,
and the Pd(II) precipitation occurred at a wide range of HCl concentrations,
up to 7 M. The precipitation of Pd(II) even at high HCl concentrations
would be caused by high hydrophobicity of DPOBP. In fact, Pd(II) was
not leached in 9 M HCl from the Pd(II) precipitate prepared in 2 M
HCl, indicating that the hydrophobic nature of the Pd(II) precipitate
prevents the exchange of [PdCl4]2– with
chloride anions (Figure S2). The selective
precipitation of Rh(III) using DPOBP was achieved in 8 M HCl: 82%
for Rh(III), 0% for Pd(II), and 0% for Pt(IV). However, the use of
DPOBP has a risk of coprecipitation of Pd(II) from high Pd(II) concentration
solutions. Therefore, we selected p-phenylene diamine
dihydrochloride (PPDA), which is the smallest aromatic diamine compound
and has higher hydrophilicity than DPOBP (solubility in 5 M HCl: 0.18
mg/mL for DPOBP, 5.6 mg/mL for PPDA). The performance for selective
Rh(III) recovery using PPDA was investigated in the following experiments.

Figure 3 The effect
of HCl concentration on metal precipitation from HCl
solutions containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) (300 mg/L each) using
DPOBP (DPOBP/Rh = 15 mol/mol, 3 h of shaking).

Selective Rh(III) Precipitation Using PPDA
The Rh(III)
precipitation experiments were carried out using PPDA as a precipitant
by changing the HCl concentration and the PPDA loading. As shown in Figure 4a, Rh(III) was precipitated
in 4–7 M HCl after 6 h of shaking, and the Rh(III) precipitation
reached a maximum of 85% in 5 M HCl. It is noteworthy that the Rh(III)-containing
precipitate prepared from 5 M HCl was easily soluble in 9 M HCl (Figure S2). This fact clearly indicates that
the decrease in the Rh(III) precipitation at high HCl concentrations
over 5 M is caused by the exchange of [RhCl6]3– with chloride anions. The effect of the loading amount of PPDA on
the Rh(III) precipitation after 6 h of shaking was studied using 5
M HCl solutions. Rh(III) precipitation increased until PPDA/Rh = 10
mol/mol, and the precipitation percentages were not changed by further
addition of PPDA (Figure 4b). Figure 4c shows the shaking time dependence of the Rh(III) precipitation
at a feed ratio of PPDA/Rh(III) = 15 mol/mol. It took at least 3 h
for Rh(III) precipitation using PPDA to become constant.

HCl solutions (300 mg/L) using PPDA (PPDA/Rh = 15 mol/mol, 6 h of

from HCl solutions containing Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III) (300 mg/L

The separation of Rh(III) from Pd(II) and Pt(IV) was studied
using
PPDA. The dependence of the metal precipitation on the HCl concentration
is shown in Figure 4d. Rh(III) precipitation occurred in 4–6 M HCl, and 82% of
Rh(III) was precipitated at a 5 M HCl concentration. On the other
hand, Pd(II) and Pt(IV) were not precipitated under the studied conditions
(1–9 M HCl). As we expected, a small aromatic diamine compound,
PPDA, worked as a highly selective precipitant of Rh(III): 82% for
Rh(III), 0% for Pd(II), and 0% for Pt(IV) in 5 M HCl.

Desorption
of Rh(III) from Precipitates
We investigated
the Rh(III) desorption from precipitates, using our precipitation
method as a Rh(III) recovery strategy. The Rh(III) desorption experiments
were performed by adding NH4OH solution to the Rh(III)-containing
precipitates. Rh(III) was quantitatively transferred from the Rh(III)-containing
precipitates using PPDA (Rh-PPDA) to NH4OH solutions of
1–5 M (Figure S3a). On the other
hand, high-concentration NH4OH solutions over 6 M were
required for the quantitative Rh(III) desorption from the Rh(III)-containing
precipitates using DPOBP (Rh-DPOBP), as shown in Figure S3b. The successful desorption of Rh(III) would be
due to the collapse of the ion-pairs composed of Rh(III) chloro-complex
anions and ammonium cations of the diamines; ammonium cations of PPDA
and DPOBP were transformed into free amines by NH4OH. It
is noteworthy that the chemical structure of the recovered DPOBP after
Rh(III) desorption was unchanged (Figure S4). Unfortunately, the recovered amount of PPDA is too small for chemical
structural analysis.

Rh(III) Recovery from Simulated Spent Catalyst
Leach Solutions
To elucidate the practical utility of our
Rh(III) separation method,
Rh(III) recovery from simulated spent catalyst leach solutions was
investigated. The simulated solutions (5 and 8 M HCl) containing PGMs
(Pd, Pt, and Rh) and other metals such as base metals and lanthanoids
(Ce, Al, Ba, Zr, La, and Y) were prepared based on the previously
reported HCl leach solutions of automobile exhaust catalysts.12,32 Because of the saturation of Ba in 8 M HCl, the concentration of
Ba in 8 M HCl is lower than that in 5 M HCl (Tables S1 and S2). The Rh(III) recovery experiments from the simulated
solutions using DPOBP or PPDA were carried out. The metal recovery
percentages were evaluated from the NH4OH solutions after
the desorption process by ICP-AES. In the case of using DPOBP, the
metal precipitation percentages were also evaluated before the desorption
process. The results of the Rh(III) recovery experiments are shown
in Figures 5 and 6, and Tables S1 and S2. As shown in Figure 5, Rh(III) was selectively precipitated in a good yield (78%) using
DPOBP from the simulated solution (8 M HCl), although Pd(II) was partially
precipitated (21%). Other metals, except Pd(II), were not detected
by ICP-AES. The precipitation of Pd(II) using DPOBP would be derived
from poor hydrophilicity of DPOBP and high Pd(II) concentration. We
have found that the desorption of Rh(III) using NH4OH solutions
is inefficient (Rh(III) desorption: 46%) when DPOBP is used as a precipitant
(Table S1). The improvement of the low
desorption efficiency is still in progress. On the other hand, PPDA
enabled highly selective Rh(III) recovery from the simulated solution:
84% for Rh(III) and less than 2% for other metals (Figure 6 and Table S2). As a result, we have achieved highly selective Rh(III)
recovery from the simulated spent catalyst leach solutions, using
aromatic primary diamines. It is very surprising that only Rh(III)
was selectively recovered in high yield using PPDA despite much higher
concentrations of Pd(II), Pt(IV), and metals other than Rh(III) in
the simulated solution.

mg/L) using PPDA.

Characterization of Rh(III)-Containing
Precipitates
To elucidate the mechanism of Rh(III) selective
recovery using aromatic
primary diamines, the structural analyses of the Rh(III)-containing
precipitates were carried out. Single crystals were prepared by adding
DPOBP or PPDA into Rh(III)-containing HCl solutions. The addition
of PPDA successfully yielded red-colored single crystals, while, unfortunately,
single crystals were not obtained using DPOBP. Figure 7 shows the crystal structure of Rh-PPDA.
Two Rh(III) chloro-complex anions ([RhCl6]3–) are linked by an ammonium form of PPDA via ionic bonds. One [RhCl6]3– interacts with four ammonium cations,
and one chloro anion coexists to balance the total charge. The obtained
three-dimensional ionic crystal is composed of the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium form of PPDA/chloride anion/H2O = 1:2:1:2. We have reported that aromatic primary monoamines
and [RhCl6]3– form unique ion-pair complexes
composed of [RhCl6]3–/anilinium/chloride
ions in a 1:6:3 ratio.31 The structure
of the ionic crystals obtained in this study is completely different
from the crystals obtained using aromatic monoamine.

Figure 7 (a–d) Crystal
structure of the Rh(III)-containing precipitate
with PPDA.

The ratios of Rh(III) and diamines
in Rh-DPOBP and Rh-PPDA were
confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS) analysis. Weight loss was observed in the range
of 180–450 °C for both precipitates, which is attributed
to the decomposition and volatilization of amines, chlorine, and water
(Figure 8a,b). The
residual weights at 800 °C were found to be 10.7 and 20.2% for
Rh-DPOBP and Rh-PPDA, respectively. It is known that the combustion
of RhCl3 in air yields Rh2O3 below
900 °C.33 The resulting weight fractions
of the residues by TGA coincide with the expected weight fractions
of Rh2O3 after combustion of the ionic crystals,
composed of the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium form
of diamine/chloride anion/H2O in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. The weight
fractions are calculated to be 11.2 and 20.9% for the ionic crystals
using DPOBP and PPDA, respectively. The XPS spectra of the precipitates
exhibit N 1s, Rh 3d, C 1s, Cl 2s, and Cl 2p signals (Figure 8c,d). The Rh/N/Cl atomic ratios
were calculated to be 1.0:4.0:7.0 and 1.0:4.0:6.9 for Rh-DPOBP and
Rh-PPDA, respectively. These atomic ratios are consistent with those
of the ionic crystals comprising the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium form of diamine/chloride anion/H2O in a 1:2:1:2
ratio (Rh/N/Cl = 1:4:7). TGA and XPS results clearly indicate that
the Rh(III)-containing precipitates using DPOBP and PPDA form ionic
structures similar to the single-crystal structure shown in Figure 5.

and (b) Rh-PPDA at a heating rate of
10 °C/min under air flow (200 mL/min). The XPS spectra of (c)
Rh-DPOBP and (d) Rh-PPDA.

The structure of Rh-PPDA in the precipitation experiments was also
investigated by powder X-ray diffraction measurements in the 2θ
range of 5–30°. As shown in Figure 9, all of the peaks observed in the measured
pattern were closely matched in position and relative intensity with
the simulated pattern generated from the single-crystal diffraction
data of Rh-PPDA. This result strongly supports that Rh(III) was precipitated
using PPDA by forming unique three-dimensional ionic crystals.

patterns of Rh-PPDA.

Mechanism of Selective
Recovery of Rh(III)
The highly
selective precipitation of Rh(III) was successfully achieved using
PPDA even from the HCl solution containing various kinds of metals,
such as PGMs, base metals, and lanthanoids. The used metals except
for PGMs are expected not to form ion-pairs with PPDA, that is, precipitates,
because they basically form cations in HCl solutions. On the other
hand, chloro-complex anions of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) have the possibility
to be precipitated via ion-pair formation with PPDA. In our previous
study, we revealed that the precipitates composed of [PdCl4]2– or [PtCl6]2– and
anilinium cations of 4-alkylanilines are unstable in high-concentration
HCl solutions and soluble by exchange of anilinium cations with protons.31 Therefore, the low stability of the ion-pairs
of [PdCl4]2– or [PtCl6]2– and PPDA (Pd-PPDA, Pt-PPDA) in HCl solutions would
be one reason for the lack of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) precipitation. Another
reason would be the high hydrophilicity of Pd-PPDA and Pt-PPDA. This
is because Pd-PPDA and Pt-PPDA are supposed to have ammonium-terminated
ion-pairs, as shown in Figure 10. It is noteworthy that Pd(II) and Pt(IV) are precipitated
using 4-butylaniline from HCl solutions (Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III):
300 mg/L each), even at high HCl concentrations (>5 M), while they
are not precipitated from HCl solutions (Pd(II), Pt(IV), and Rh(III):
100 mg/L each) at 1–8 M (Figure S5).31 Because the ion-pairs composed of
[PdCl4]2– or [PtCl6]2– and 4-butylanilines are alkyl-terminated hydrophobic structures,
the high concentration of Pd(II) and Pt(IV) leads to precipitation
despite the low stability of the ion-pairs in HCl solutions. Considering
the results of 4-butylaniline, the high solubility of Pd- and Pt-PPDA
in HCl solutions, which is attributed to their ion-pair structures
contributes significantly to the highly selective precipitation of
Rh(III) using PPDA. The selective precipitation of Rh(III) using DPOBP
would be achieved by the same reasons, although Pd(II) is coprecipitated
owing to high hydrophobicity of DPOBP.

Figure 10 Expected chemical structures
of Pd-PPDA and Pt-PPDA.

Rh(III) precipitation
occurs via formation of ionic crystals composed
of the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium form of PPDA/chloride
anion/H2O in a 1:2:1:2 ratio. It should be noted that single
crystals of Rh-PPDA were obtained even from the simulated spent catalyst
leach solution by adding PPDA and leaving to stand for several days
(Figure S6). This fact clearly indicates
that the formation of ionic crystals between PPDA and [RhCl6]3– is significantly selective regardless of the
existence of other metal ions. Thus, the formation of the unique ionic
crystals plays a key role in the highly selective recovery of Rh(III).

Conclusions
Highly selective recovery of Rh(III) from metal-containing
HCl
solutions has been achieved using aromatic primary diamines as precipitants.
Rh(III) was preferentially and selectively precipitated from the HCl
solutions and Rh(III) in the precipitate was transferred into NH4OH solution. Highly selective recovery of Rh(III) from the
simulated spent catalyst leach solution was successfully achieved
using PPDA as a precipitant. Structural analysis revealed that the
successful recovery of Rh(III) is attributed to the formation of ionic
crystals comprising the [RhCl6]3–/ammonium
form of diamine/chloride anion/H2O in a 1:2:1:2 ratio.
This method will be promising for use in the purification process
of Rh owing to significantly high selectivity of Rh as well as the
practical Rh recovery from the spent catalysts.

Metal Precipitation Experiments
Using Aromatic Primary Amines
To the HCl solutions (1 mL)
containing Rh(III) (300 mg/L) or Pd(II),
Pt(IV), and Rh(III) (300 mg/L each) aromatic primary amines (ODA,
DPOP, DPOBP, or PPDA) were added and the mixtures were shaken vigorously
at room temperature. After centrifugation (7200g,
10 min), the metal concentration in the supernatant was determined
by ICP-AES. The HCl concentrations, the amount of precipitants, and
the shaking time were changed in the metal precipitation experiments.

Desorption of Rh(III) from Precipitates
To 5 M HCl
solutions (1 mL) containing Rh(III) (300 mg/L) DPOBP (DPOBP/Rh = 5
mol/mol) or PPDA (PPDA/Rh = 15 mol/mol) was added and the mixtures
were shaken vigorously at room temperature. The resulting solid was
separated by centrifugation (7200g, 10 min) and the
supernatant was removed. After drying in vacuo at room temperature,
NH4OH solution (1 mL) was added to the solid and the mixture
was shaken vigorously at room temperature. The remaining solid was
removed by filtration and the metal concentration in the resulting
filtrate was determined by ICP-AES.

Rh(III) Recovery from Simulated
Spent Catalyst Leach Solutions
To a simulated spent catalyst
leach solution (5 M HCl, 10 mL) PPDA
(PPDA/Rh = 15 mol/mol) was added and the mixture was shaken vigorously
for 6 h at room temperature. The resulting solid was collected by
filtration and washed with PPDA-saturated 5 M HCl solution (ca. 5.6
mg/mL). To the solid 1 M NH4OH solution was added (10 mL)
and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 10 min at room temperature.
After removal of the solid by filtration, the metal concentration
in the resulting filtrate was determined by ICP-AES. The Rh(III) recovery
experiment using DPOBP was performed in the similar manner. A simulated
solution of 8 M HCl and DPOBP (DPOBP/Rh = 15 mol/mol, 3 h of shaking)
was used and the resulting solid was washed with DPOBP-saturated 8
M HCl solution (ca. 0.10 mg/mL). In the desorption process, 8 M NH4OH solution was used and the mixture was shaken vigorously
for 1 h. The metal precipitation percentages were evaluated using
the filtrate before the desorption process.

Preparation of Rh-DPOBP
and Rh-PPDA
To a 5 M HCl solution
(20 mL) containing Rh(III) (300 mg/L) DPOBP (DPOBP/Rh = 5 mol/mol)
or PPDA (PPDA/Rh = 15 mol/mol) was added and the mixture was shaken
vigorously at room temperature. The resulting solid was collected
by filtration and washed with methanol to remove excess amine hydrochloride.
The solid was dried for 24 h at room temperature in vacuo.

Preparation
of Single Crystals
To a 5 M HCl solution
(5 mL) containing Rh(III) (300 mg/L) PPDA (PPDA/Rh = 10 mol/mol) was
added and the resulting solution was left to stand for several days.
Single crystals were obtained as red-colored plates. Preparation of
single crystals from a simulated spent catalyst leach solution (8
M HCl) using PPDA was performed in the same manner.

Measurements
1H NMR spectra were recorded
using a JEOL JNM-ECX 500 NMR spectrometer (Jeol Co., Ltd.). An ICP-AES
instrument (SPS5510, SII Nanotechnology Inc.) was used for the metal
concentration measurements. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
measurements were performed using an AXIS-ULTRA X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (Kratos Analytical Ltd.). Element quantification was
performed using the relative sensitivity factors supplied with instrument
control software (N 1s: 0.477, Cl 2s: 0.493, Rh 3d: 4.822). TGA measurements
were carried out using a STA7300 (Hitachi High-Tech Science Corp.)
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min under air flow (200 mL/min). The
powder X-ray diffraction measurements were conducted on a Rigaku Ultima
IV. The single crystal X-ray diffraction data were collected using
a Rigaku Saturn 724 CCD diffractometer with Mo Kα radiation
(λ = 0.71075 Å). Table S3 lists
the crystal data and structure refinement. Data collection, cell refinement,
and data reduction were performed using CrysAlisPro software.34 The structure was solved by direct methods using
the program SHELXT35 and refined by full-matrix
least-squares methods on F2 using SHELXL2014.36 All materials for publication were prepared by Yadokari-XG 2009
software.37 Tables of positional and thermal
parameters, bond lengths and angles, torsion angles and figures may
be found from the Cambridge Crystallographic Centre by referencing
the CCDC number 1922165.
