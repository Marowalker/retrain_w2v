The development of organic materials for electrochemical
energy
storage has attracted great attention because of their high natural
abundance and relatively low toxicity. The bulk of these studies focus
on small molecules, polymers, or porous/framework-type materials that
employ one type of redox moiety. Here, we report the synthesis and
testing of organic materials that incorporate two distinct types of
redox units: triptycene-based quinones and perylene diimides. We examine
this “dual redox” concept through the synthesis of both
frameworks and small molecule model compounds with the redox units
positioned at the vertices and connection points. Such a design increases
the theoretical capacity of the material. It also imparts high stability
because both examples are relatively rigid and highly insoluble in
the electrolyte. Lithium-ion batteries consisting of the framework
and the small molecule have an excellent cycling retention of 75 and
77%, respectively, over 500 cycles at 1 C. Our work emphasizes the
advantages of using multiple redox units in the design of the cathodic
materials and redox-active triptycene linkages to achieve high cycling
stability.

Introduction
Redox-active organic compounds are promising
electrodes for lithium-ion
batteries because these compounds have a low mass and the ability
to accept multiple electrons, leading to high theoretical capacity.1−6 Small molecules such as carbonyl derivatives are suitable candidates
for organic electrodes because of their high specific capacity, widespread
abundance, and well-defined redox properties. For example, arylene
diimide derivatives such as naphthalene diimides (NDI) and perylene
diimides (PDI) are widely used for designing organic electrodes because
they are robust industrial dye molecules that have an inherent high
stability.7 Quinone derivatives such as
benzoquinones and anthracenequinones are promising examples because
of their fast and reversible reduction properties, providing high
rate capability. Both arylene diimide and quinone derivatives can
reversibly accept two electrons at potentials that are appropriated
for Li-ion battery operation.

When designing organic materials
for battery electrodes, one has
to consider their solubility in the electrolyte because dissolution
is the most common mechanism of capacity fading. Small molecules tend
to readily dissolve in organic electrolytes, causing rapid capacity
fading at early discharge/charge cycles.8−13 Higher ordered structures such as polymers14−20 and frameworks21−31 can be prepared as an effective strategy to circumvent this issue.
In particular, structures that contain triptycene derivatives32 are intrinsically less soluble in organic solvents
and have unique three-dimensional (3D) structure and internal free
volume.33−40 Triptycene-based porous materials have been developed and while
these electrodes can include redox active groups at linkers and/or
vertices (triptycene; core units), most have consisted only one type
of redox active group, either at the linker or core units. Such a
design inevitably decreases the theoretical capacity because of the
presence of redox-inactive mass.41,42 To achieve
a higher theoretical capacity, the incorporation of redox-active groups
at both the core and the linker is desired.

Here, we present
the synthesis and testing of dual redox triptycene-based
materials consisting of core building blocks and linkers that are
both redox-active (Scheme 1). As discussed above, triptycene derivatives are excellent
candidates for a 3D vertex to design core units with low solubility
and high stability. PDIs are desirable energy storage materials with
reversible redox activity. In this study we have modified triptycene
with quinone-type functional groups to provide complementary redox
activity for PDI. A framework-type (Fr-PDI) structure and a small
molecule system (Sm-PDI) were synthesized, characterized, and tested
to determine the generality of this approach.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Route to
the Triptycene-Based Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI
Results and Discussion
The synthesis of Fr-PDI begins
with triptycene triquinone (Figure S1).
Aminated triptycene triquinone (TTQ-NH2) was prepared next
by the addition reaction of triptycene
triquinone with p-phenylenediamine in ethanol at
0 °C for 12 h. After recrystallization in MeOH, dark-blue colored
TTQ-NH2 was obtained in a quantitative yield (89% relative
to triptycene triquinone) (Figure S4).
The successful synthesis of the resulting product was supported by
both the 1H NMR and heteronuclear multiple bond correlation
(HMBC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) (Figure S5). The strong coupling between aromatic carbons and protons
on phenyl groups is seen in the HMBC NMR spectrum from 7.04–6.62
ppm as expected. Further, the protons on nitrogen atoms from −NH
and −NH2 functional groups were identified at 9.26
and 5.26 ppm, respectively. Because these protons are directly attached
on the nitrogen atoms, no coupling in the HMBC spectrum was observed
in both cases. Interestingly, we observe three different proton peaks
at very close chemical shifts in the 1H NMR spectra at
8.50, 8.44, and 8.38 ppm. These protons are presumably because of
the existence of regioisomers of TTQ-NH2 products because
the addition reaction of p-phenylenediamine is nonregioselective.
Note that the synthesized TTQ-NH2 is noticeably less soluble
in organic solvents as compared to nonfunctionalized triptycene triquinones.
Such a modification not only provides the molecular sites to form
the frameworks, but also improves the stability of triptycene triquinone
precursors.

Fr-PDI was then prepared by the condensation reaction
between TTQ-NH2 and PDI. The Fr-PDIs are dark-red colored
powders that are
almost completely insoluble in most organic solvents. To characterize
these insoluble materials, different techniques such as Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), solid-state 13C NMR, and
high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used.
The disappearance of the N–H bands at 3300–3200 cm–1 after the condensation reaction suggests that the
amine groups from the aminated framework precursor (TTQ-NH2) were all consumed to form the imide linkages (Figure 1A). The formation of Fr-PDI
was further confirmed by the 13C cross-polarization magic-angle-spinning
(CP-MAS) NMR (Figure 1B). The presence of the aliphatic carbon peak at ≈40 ppm at
the triptycene junction suggests that the triptycene units are still
intact after the high temperature condensation reaction. Moreover,
the carbonyl peaks at 162 ppm coming from both the core triptycene
and PDI, as well as the broad aromatic peaks at 127 ppm provide very
strong support for the successful synthesis of Fr-PDI.

mV/s (D), galvanostatic discharge/charge curves at current rates of
0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 3 C (E), and capacity decay and Columbic efficiency
at a current rate of 1 C (F) of Fr-PDI in a 1 M LiPF6 ethylene
carbonate: dimethoxyethane (1:9 v/v) electrolyte.

To gain additional insight into the formation of
Fr-PDI, XPS was
used to compare the changes in bonding environments before and after
the condensation reaction. Specifically, the N 1s XPS spectra for
the precursor TTQ-NH2 contains one nitrogen peak at 400
eV (Figure S6) corresponding to the amine
groups. Once formed into Fr-PDI (Figure 1C), the subsequent N 1s spectrum can be deconvoluted
into two peaks at 401 and 399 eV, consistent with the new imide linkages
and secondary amines present in the starting material.

To test
the feasibility of these organic materials as cathodes
for lithium-ion batteries, coin cells were assembled with lithium
metal as the anode and Fr-PDI as a cathode. Cyclic voltammetry shows
that Fr-PDI has one broad reversible peak at 2.5 V versus Li/Li+, that corresponds to the redox-active groups of the triptycene
quinones and PDIs (Figure 1D). Such a reversible redox peak resembles the reversible
feature of the triptycene triquinone precursor which occurs at 2.6
V versus Li/LI+ (Figure S15C). Figure 1E shows
the galvanostatic discharge/charge voltage profiles of Fr-PDI cathode
batteries in the range of 1.5–3.5 V at different current densities.
Note that the current densities were calculated according to the theoretical
capacity of the organic materials where Ctheo = 201 mA h g–1 for Fr-PDI. Overall, one stable
discharge plateau was observed in the range of 2.4–2.8 V and
the discharge capacity was 93 mA h g–1 for Fr-PDI.

The cycling performance of Fr-PDI was evaluated next. Fr-PDI delivers
reversible capacities of 57 mA h g–1 in the first
cycle while maintaining around 43 mA h g–1 after
500 cycles at a 1 C rate. Although Fr-PDI displays a slight decrease
in capacity upon cycling, this result still demonstrates an 85 and
75% capacity retention after 200 and 500 cycles, respectively (Figure 1F). Moreover, the
Columbic efficiency reaches close to 100% during the entire cycling
process. Overall, these results suggest that Fr-PDI is a very stable
cathodic material because of the high capacity retention rate with
an excellent Columbic efficiency.

Inspired by the stability
of the Fr-PDI framework, we decided to
further evaluate our design at a molecular level. Small molecules
with two modified triptycenes connected by one PDI linker were prepared
(Scheme 1). The aminated
precursor for the small molecule (TMQ-NH2) was prepared
from triptycene monoquinone in a similar manner as the previous aminated
precursor (Figure S7). The resulting product
after the addition reaction of triptycene monoquinone and p-phenylenediamine was purified by column chromatography
yielding a dark-green colored powder with 80% yield (relative to triptycene
monoquinone). Strong coupling correlations for aromatic protons on
the HMBC NMR spectrum were seen at 8.81–7.46 ppm from the triptycene
core and 7.05–6.89 ppm from the phenylene linker. Further,
the protons on nitrogen atoms were identified at 8.81 and 5.19 ppm
for −NH and −NH2, respectively (Figure S8).

Dark-red colored Sm-PDI was
obtained after the condensation reaction
of TMQ-NH2 and PDI. Different solid-state characterization
methods were again utilized to characterize Sm-PDI because this compound
has a very low solubility (a requirement for battery operation). First,
the formation of Sm-PDI was confirmed by comparing the FTIR spectra
of the precursor (TMQ-NH2) and Sm-PDI. The N–H band
at 3400–3200 cm–1 disappeared after the condensation
reaction, suggesting the complete consumption of the precursor (Figure 2A). CP-MAS NMR provides
further support for the successful synthesis of Sm-PDI, showing similar
aliphatic carbon peaks, carbonyl peaks, and two different aromatic
peaks at 47, 145, 162, and 124 ppm as similarly seen in the Fr-PDI
system (Figure 2B).
Additionally, the N 1s XPS spectrum of Sm-PDI consists of one peak
at 400 eV before the condensation reaction that can be deconvoluted
into two peaks at 401 and 399 eV, which further supports the formation
of Sm-PDI (Figure 2C).

(A), 13C CP-MAS NMR spectrum of Sm-PDI (B), deconvoluted
N 1s XPS spectrum of Sm-PDI (C), cyclic voltammogram at a scan rate
of 0.5 mV/s (D), galvanostatic discharge/charge curves at a current
rates at 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1, and 3 C (E), and capacity decay and Columbic
efficiency at a current rate 1 C (F) of Sm-PDI in a 1 M LiPF6 ethylene carbonate: dimethoxyethane (1:9 v/v) electrolyte.

Coin cells were assembled using Sm-PDI as the cathode
and evaluated
by cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic discharge/charge measurements.
Because both Sm-PDI and Fr-PDI consist of the redox active groups
of the triptycene quinones and PDIs, their cyclic voltammetry shows
the same broad reversible peak at 2.5 V versus Li/Li+ (Figure 2D). Similarly, this
redox peak well agrees with the reversible redox peak of the triptycene
monoquinone precursor at approximately 2.6 V versus Li/Li+ (Figure S15B). One stable plateau for
Sm-PDI was observed with a discharge plateau in the galvanostatic
discharge/charge voltage profile in the range of 2.4–2.9 V
(Figure 2E). The discharge
capacity was 88 mA h g–1 where Ctheo = 141 mA h g–1. Finally, the cycling
performance of Sm-PDI was tested. Sm-PDI delivered 88 and 77% capacity
retention after 200 and 500 cycles, respectively, with ∼100%
Columbic efficiency during cycling (Figure 2F).

It is noteworthy to highlight that
Sm-PDI material is a small molecule,
which are typically prone to rapid capacity fading, yet this system
has a surprisingly high capacity retention and high Columbic efficiency
after an extensive cycling. Such a high capacity retention has not
been reported in other small molecule NDI/PDI-based Li-ion battery
systems (Table 1).
Moreover, this value is comparable to the capacity retention of the
extremely stable framework and triptycene-based system in the literature.21−24 Overall, both Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI are very stable cathodic materials
that can withstand the high cycling process, while maintaining relatively
good capacity retention.

To gain a further fundamental understanding of our
design, we have
tested three model compounds that represent fragments of the structures
of Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI (Figure S15). The
cyclic voltammetry of these compounds agrees with the broad reversible
peaks for frameworks and small molecules. More importantly, all of
these compounds suffer from poor cycling stability having both the
low capacity or low Columbic efficiency after only 20 cycles. It is
therefore the combination of these materials demonstrated in our design
that yields the higher stability of the framework and the small molecule.

In order to provide more insight into the stability of these organic
materials, Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI batteries were disassembled after cell
cycling, and their cathodes were recovered. These cathodes were still
intact without any delamination after 500 cycles, which confirms their
outstanding insolubility in organic solvents (Figure 3, inset). On the other hand, the cathodes
consisting of the model compounds were almost completely delaminated
after only 25 cycles. (Figure S15 D–F, inset) Considering that Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI are almost completely
insoluble in organic electrolytes and the morphology of the active
materials are well-distributed in the carbon matrix (Figure 3), the ∼25% decrease
in capacity of both systems after 500 cycles could be due to a number
of factors including side reactions that chemically degrade the materials
after many cycles, geometry changes of the compound during charging
and discharging that cause the compound to isolate itself from the
conductive carbon network, the partial delamination of the electrode
from the current collector and the use of a flexible linker that causes
the movement in the molecular structure leading to kinetic barriers
such as Li+ charge transfer kinetics over time,41,44 or an overall lack of crystallinity in the electrode materials.
In previous studies, we determined that the high crystallinity and
smaller aggregate sizes in the electrode could lead to the shorter
lithium ion diffusion pathways, a shorter distance that electrons
need to travel to reach the entirety of the redox units, and a closer
packing of aromatic units which can increase the rate of electron
hopping between the redox units, thus leading to high performance
of the electrode.45 Both Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI
are amorphous and this may have attributed to the overall decrease
in capacities.

It is common for organic electrodes not to reach
their theoretical
capacities.18,46−49 Similarly, both of our materials,
Fr-PDI and Sm-PDI reach approximately 50% of the corresponding theoretical
values at 0.1 C. Possible reasons for this are that the materials
have redox units that are electrically isolated because of the nonconjugated
structure of the materials, electrostatic repulsion of charged species
preventing the multiredox capabilities of the compounds from being
realized, or the presence of amines attached to the quinones creating
a large overpotential required to attain the desired two electron
reduction of the quinones.50,51 One might be able to
improve the conductivity of the cathodes by trying different conductive
carbon, making nanocomposites or different mechanical mixing techniques
such as overhead mixer or ball milling to process.11,52−55 Such techniques allow the organic materials to form smaller aggregate
sizes which can help to achieve better stability and high usages of
active materials. Nonetheless, the stability of these examples after
500 cycles approaches that of solid-state inorganic cathodes, albeit
with lower overall capacity.

In conclusion, we have prepared
triptycene-based frameworks and
small molecules that contain redox units in both the linker and vertex.
Lithium-ion batteries using Fr-PDI delivers a capacity of 93 mA h
g–1 at a 0.1 C rate and 75% capacity retention with
∼100% Columbic efficiency after 500 cycles; whereas Sm-PDI
delivers a capacity of 88 mA h g–1 and a 77% capacity
retention with ∼100% Columbic efficiency after 500 cycles.
The stability of the materials is outstanding. It was unexpected that
the small molecules would perform as well as the frameworks with an
excellent cycling stability. Our strategy not only helps incorporate
multiple redox-active functionalities into the design of new materials,
but also teaches one how to achieve a high cycling stability, even
for a relatively small molecule system. The small molecule example
suggests that molecular systems mitigate the necessity to create macromolecular
systems that have less well defined structures and should motivate
the preparation and testing of these types of structures in the future.

Experimental Methods
Materials Preparation
All reagents were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. All electrochemical measurements
and construction of lithium-ion batteries were performed at room temperature
in an argon-filled glovebox (mBraun) with oxygen and moisture levels
below 5 ppm.

Synthesis of Triptycene Tribenzoquinone
The synthesis
of tetramethoxy anthracene was based on a procedure previously reported.36 Triptycene tribenzoquinone was prepared as described
elsewhere.32 Briefly, a mixture of tetramethoxyanthracene
(1.2 g, 4.1 mmol) and 1,4-benzoquinone (2.2 g, 20 mmol) in acetic
acid (125 mL) was refluxed for 48 h. The resulting mixture was cooled
to room temperature and filtered. The solids were washed with dimethylformamide
and acetone to yield red solids. The solids were then dissolved in
HI (140 mL) and acetic acid (300 mL) and refluxed for 8 h. The reaction
mixture was cooled to room temperature, filtered, and washed with
acetone to give grey-colored solids. The resulting solids were stirred
with sodium dichromate dihydrate (1.1 g, 3.7 mmol) in acetic acid
for 3 h. The reaction mixture was poured into water and neutralized
with an aqueous NaHCO3 solution. The solution was then
extracted with dichloromethane, and the organic layer was dried over
MgSO4 to give 1.2 g of TTQ (86% yield; relative to tetramethoxy
anthracene). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz) 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 6.70 (s, 6H), 6,60 (s,

Soxhlet thimble and was extracted with methanol for 1 day and acetone
for 3 h. The framework was further purified by dissolving in 15 mL
methanesulfonic acid overnight. The solution was then added dropwise
to 1 L of methanol in a rapidly stirring beaker. The suspension was
then concentrated on a rotary evaporator until the volume of methanol
was approximately 500 mL. The suspended frameworks were collected

mmol) and 1,4-benzoquinone (2.2 g, 20 mmol) in acetic acid (125 mL)
was refluxed for 3 h. The resulting mixture was cooled to room temperature
and filtered. The crude product was column chromatographed on silica
gel using a gradient mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as the solvent
to give 3.0 g of triptycene monoquinone (60% yield; relative to anthracene). 1H NMR (CDCl3, 400 MHz): δ 7.44–7.42
(m, 4H), 7.05–7.03 (m, 4H), 6.60 (s, 2H), 5.80 (s, 2H).

yield; relative to TMQ-NH2). 13C CP/MAS NMR:
δ 162.33, 144.93, 124.89, 47.50 ppm.

Synthesis of PDI-An
The synthesis of PDI-An was based
on a procedure previously reported.56 A

mmol), 20 g of imidazole, 50 mg of zinc acetate, and 0.28 mL (3.17
mmol) of aniline was stirred at 100 °C in a two-necked round
bottom flask. The temperature of the reaction mixture was increased
to 160 °C and maintained at the same temperature for 8 h. The

Coin Cell Assembly
Fr-PDI, Sm-PDI, and the model compounds
(PDI-An, TMQ, and TTQ) were ground into a fine powder with a mortar
and pestle. The ground organic compounds were then mixed with carbon
Super P and PVDF in a 30:60:10 (w/w/w) ratio and suspended in NMP
at a concentration 120 mg/mL. The mixtures were then cast on to an
aluminum foil using a notch-bar 200 μm. The electrodes were
dried in air on a hotplate at a temperature of 80 °C and then
in a vacuum antechamber at a temperature of 80 °C before bringing
them into the glovebox. CR2023-type coin cells were purchased from
MTI Corporation. A copper foil with a diameter of 16 mm (McMaster-Carr)
was used as the anodic current collector, a lithium foil with a diameter
of 16 mm was used as the reference/auxiliary electrode, and a Celgard
polypropylene separator with a diameter of 19 mm was used to prevent
short circuiting. An electrode punch (DPM Solution Inc.) was used
to cut the electrodes to a 16 mm diameter and a hydraulic press (BT
Innovations) was used to hermetically seal the cell. Approximately
80 μL of electrolyte [1:9 (v/v) ethylene carbonate/dimethoxyethane,
1 M LiPF6] was used to fill the cells prior to sealing.
