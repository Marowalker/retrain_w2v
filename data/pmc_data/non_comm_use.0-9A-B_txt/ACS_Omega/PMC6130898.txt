Polymer
nanoparticles are used extensively in biomedical applications.
Poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA) nanoparticles obtained via nanoprecipitation
were unstable and flocculate or precipitate from solution within a
few hours. A simple method to improve the stability of the particles
using surfactants at low concentrations was carried out to produce
PMMA nanoparticles with long-term stability in water (>6 months).
The increased stability was attributed to the incorporation of surfactants
inside the polymer particles during nanoprecipitation. The same methodology
was also adopted to encapsulate a highly fluorescent hydrophobic perylene
tetraester inside the polymer nanoparticles with good stability in
water. Because of the presence of the anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate,
the particles showed a negative zeta potential of −34.7 mV
and an average size of 150 nm. Similarly, the dye-encapsulated polymer
nanoparticles showed a zeta potential of −35.1 mV and an average
particle size of 180 nm. By varying the concentration of encapsulated
dyes inside the polymer nanoparticles, dye aggregation could be controlled,
and the fluorescence profiles of the nanoparticles were altered. To
understand the uptake and toxicity of the polymer nanoparticles, baby
hamster kidney cells were chosen as a model system. The polymer nanoparticles
were taken up by the cells within 3 h and were nontoxic at concentrations
as high as 100 ppm. The confocal micrographs of the cells revealed
localized fluorescence from the polymer nanoparticles around the nucleus
in the cytoplasm without the penetration of the nuclear envelope.

Introduction
Nanoprecipitation is
a simple and effective method for the preparation
of polymer nanoparticles.1 On the basis
of the structure of the polymer, good solvent/bad solvent mixtures
such as tetrahydrofuran/water,2 dimethylformamide/water,3,4 dimethyl sulfoxide/water,5 and acetone/water6 were used for the preparation of polymer nanoparticles.
Also, several commercially available polymers have been used for the
precipitation of particles, mostly in the micrometer size range.2,6−10 The main drawbacks of such methods are poor colloidal stability,
excessive use of organic solvent, and limited control on particle
size.11 The amphiphilic block copolymers
can undergo self-assembly during precipitation,10−12 which results
in stable particle formation in solution. Such particles were used
to encapsulate dyes,13−16 drugs,5,17−20 and nanomaterials.21,22

In the case of bioimaging, a few critical requirements such
as
water dispersability, low toxicity, and high chemical and photostability
need to be incorporated into the particles.23−25 Dye-conjugated
nanoparticles have been used for imaging applications, but require
extensive synthetic modifications to improve water dispersability
and stability.26,27 In contrast to having a photoactive
polymer, several approaches were opted for the encapsulation of fluorescent
small molecules inside a polymer particle. The most common polymer
used for the encapsulation of drugs or other small molecules is poly(lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA).28−30 The balance of hydrophilicity
and hydrophobicity of the polymer backbone allows the encapsulation
of a series of dye molecules such as bisdemethoxycurcumin,29 Nile red,30 NIR-BODIPY,26 and indocyanine green.14 The drawbacks of such approaches include multistep synthesis, difficulty
in getting pure particles, scaling up issues, and being expensive
to be adopted for a wide range of applications.

The focus of
the current study is to establish a simple protocol
for the synthesis of hydrophobic polymer nanoparticles that are stable
in aqueous solution. In this study, poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)
was selected as the polymer matrix owing to the versatility in properties,
low toxicity, optical transparency, and easy accessibility. A few
parameters such as the volume of the poor solvent added, rate of stirring,
rate of addition, temperature, and concentration of polymers were
optimized. Also, the same procedure was used to prepare and stabilize
the polymer nanoparticles encapsulated with the dye molecules.

Perylene tetrabutylester (PTE, Figure S1) was selected as the dye of choice owing to its easy access, high
quantum yield, high solubility in organic solvents, and photostability.
In solution, the perylene derivative exists in its molecular form
(monomeric form). As the concentration increases, favorable π–π
interactions between the perylene cores facilitate the formation of
aggregates, which results in characteristic changes in the absorption
and emission maxima. Owing to the favorable hydrophobic interactions
between the polymer and PTE, we expect a homogeneous distribution
with a bright fluorescence emission from the polymer nanoparticles.13,31

In particular, we attempted to answer the following questions,
such as (i) Is it possible to make large amounts of stable PMMA nanoparticles
incorporated with a perylene dye?, (ii) Do the optical properties
of perylene dye change after incorporating inside the polymer nanoparticle?,
and (iii) Do these particles enter and interact with the cellular
medium and organelles of a human cell?

Results and Discussion
Optimization
of Addition Method
The slow addition of
polymer solution into water leads to the formation of white flakes
on the surface of water and a translucent solution. On the other hand,
with the rapid addition of polymer solution in acetone to water, a
homogeneous translucent solution was observed. The size and morphology
of the polymer particles were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM). During the slow addition of polymer solution into water, interconnected
polymer nanoparticles (Figure 1A) were observed. However, the rapid addition gave discrete
particles (Figure 1B) with an average size of 115 ± 25 nm (SEM). From the dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements, the hydrodynamic size of the
polymer particles was observed to be ca. 180 nm with a zeta potential
of −19.6 mV.

addition (A) and fast addition (B); 30 000× magnification;
scale bar is 100 nm.

The order of mixing of the two phases has an impact on particle
shape and size distribution. The addition of water into the polymer
solution led to a large particle size distribution. On the other hand,
the rapid addition of polymer solution in acetone to a large amount
of water gave nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution and well-defined
shapes. Because of this observation, all experiments were carried
out by rapidly pouring the organic polymer solution into the aqueous
phase.

Stabilization of Particles in Solution
The precipitated
PMMA nanoparticles showed aggregation upon storage at room temperature.
To prevent the aggregation and precipitation of polymer particles,
the surfactant sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) was added during the synthesis.
In preliminary trials, the SDS solution at critical micelle concentrations
(CMC = 8 mM, 10 mL), which served as the aqueous phase, and the PMMA
solution in acetone (4 mg/mL, 1 mL) were used. However, the high concentrations
of the surfactant in water led to the formation of SDS crystals, which
then warranted the optimization of SDS concentration (Table 1). In all experiments, SDS and
PMMA were dissolved in acetone first, poured into excess of water,
and then precipitated as nanoparticles. The dynamic light scattering
graphs corresponding to the values reported in Table 1 are shown in Figure S2.

The use of surfactants
to stabilize nanoparticles is a common technique;
however, our methodology reduces the amount of surfactant used significantly.32 From Table 1, it is evident that the average size of the polymer
nanoparticles varied from 150 to 270 nm by changing the concentration
of the surfactant. Pure PMMA nanoparticles without the surfactant
showed a size of 180 nm and a zeta potential of −19.6 mV. The
addition of an optimum concentration (1–2 wt %) of SDS led
to the formation of stable particles with an increase in hydrodynamic
size to 191 nm [polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.095], a large negative
zeta potential of −30 mV, and a long-term stability in solution.
The increase in the zeta potential of nanoparticles prevents the aggregation
or flocculation of the nanoparticles through the electrostatic repulsive
forces. The measurement of the conductivity of the nanoparticle dispersions
showed that with less than 3 wt % of surfactant added, the conductivity
remains constant below 10 μS cm–1, and a sharp
increase in conductivity was observed with an increase in the SDS
concentration. As we only added 2 wt % of SDS during the synthesis,
the analysis of the supernatant solution showed no free SDS in solution.

Preparation of PTE-Encapsulated PMMA Nanoparticles
The photostable
perylene-based dyes show interesting optical properties
with high quantum yields, owing to the formation of H-aggregates.33−35 As a result of the aggregation in solution, the absorbance spectrum
undergoes a spectral inversion and the emission spectrum exhibits
prominent bathochromic shifts.36−38 Dyes such as rhodamine and perylene
diimide have also shown aggregation behavior inside the polymer nanoparticles.39

The precipitation experiments with pure
PTE and PMMA particles were carried out separately in the presence
of 2 wt % SDS. The SEM micrographs of the pure dye particles showed
rod-type structures (Figure 2A), whereas the polymer particles were seen as spheres (Figure 2B). The precipitation
by the addition of the separate solutions (same concentration and
volume) of PMMA and PTE dye simultaneously into water showed both
rods and spheres corresponding to the individual compounds (Figure 2C). Both dye and
polymer dissolved in acetone (Figure 2D) and coprecipitated rapidly from water gave only
spherical particles, indicating that PTE had been encapsulated inside
PMMA.

Figure 2 SEM micrographs of pure PTE (A), PMMA (B) nanomaterials prepared
separately using the nanoprecipitation method. Mixture of PTE and
PMMA nanomaterials prepared by adding the two solutions separately
(C) with a magnified section of the sample (inset) and coprecipitated
PMMA–PTE particles (D) from a previously mixed mixture.

The absorption spectrum of PTE
in acetone solution (Figure 3A) shows a shoulder peak at
410 nm and two peaks at 438 and 465 nm, corresponding to the 0–2,
0–1, and 0–0 transitions, respectively, indicating the
presence of monomeric perylene in solution. The ratio of the absorption
intensity A0–0/A0–1 gives an indication of the level of aggregation
of the perylene dye.40 In solution, the
ratio of the peaks gave a value of 1.23. After nanoprecipitation,
there is an inversion in the relative intensities of the 0–1
and 0–0 peaks, with the ratio changing from 1.23 to 0.88, suggesting
the formation of aggregates. Such observations were reported earlier
by our laboratory and other groups.37,38,41−44 The formation of the aggregates is also evident in
the fluorescence spectra (Figure 3B) of the PTE dye before and after precipitation. Before
precipitation, a monomeric emission spectrum was obtained with the
peak maxima at 485 and 515 nm. After the precipitation of the dye,
the emission maximum showed a bathochromic shift (∼90 nm),
and the observed maximum at 592 nm corresponds to the emission from
the perylene excimer. Further evidence of the aggregation inside the
particle can be observed by comparing the fluorescence of the nanoparticle
solutions to the free dye solution (Figure S5).

from the acetone solution through evaporation; nanoprecipitated PTE
(F) and PMMA–PTE (G) nanoparticles.

The analyses of the photophysical properties of the nanoparticles
indicate the interaction between PTE and PMMA inside the particles
(Figure 3C). The comparison
of the A0–0/A0–1 ratio in the absorption spectra of PTE (0.88) and
PMMA–PTE (1.00) shows a lower degree of aggregation in PMMA–PTE,
which could be due to the disruption of aggregation and random packing
of the perylene molecules inside the polymer lattice. The normalized
emission spectrum (Figure 3D) further supports this hypothesis, in which the pure PTE
showed significant aggregation-induced quenching (ACQ)44 and PMMA–PTE particles gave an enhanced
fluorescence emission. Besides quenching the emission, the pure PTE
particles (∼150 nm) showed a large stokes shift as compared
to the PMMA–PTE (∼100 nm) particles.

The films
of PTE powder and the PTE and PMMA–PTE particles
were prepared by drop-casting the acetone solutions or dispersions
and visualized using a confocal microscope under identical imaging
conditions. The slow evaporation of acetone on a glass plate led to
the formation of rod-shaped PTE particles (Figure 3E), which exhibited a strong fluorescence.
The nanoprecipitated spherical particles of PTE (Figure 3F) exhibited a weak fluorescence
because of ACQ, and the PMMA–PTE (Figure 3G) particles showed a strong fluorescence.

In case of the polymer particles, the incorporation of low concentrations
of PTE showed monomeric emission peaks, whereas a high concentration
of PTE led to the formation of peaks corresponding to the excimer
formation. The emission intensity reduced with an increasing concentration
of PTE, indicating an ACQ. This property was further investigated
by varying the loading of PTE from 0.5 to 25 wt % inside the PMMA
nanoparticles. The results were broadly categorized at low loading
(0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 wt %, Figure 4) and high loading (5, 10, 17.5, and 25 wt %, Figure 5) conditions.

nanoparticles with (-■-) 0.5 wt %, (-▲-) 1 wt %, and
(-⧫-) 2 wt % PTE loading (the effective concentration ranging
from 3 to 13 μM). The arrows indicate the effects of increasing
PTE dye concentration encapsulated inside the particle.

PMMA–PTE
nanoparticles with PTE loading varied from (-⧫-) 5 wt %, (-▼-)
10 wt %, (-▲-) 17.5 wt %, and (-●-) 25 wt % (effective
PTE concentration ranging from 33 to 165 μM in the final nanoprecipitated
solution). All fluorescence measurements were measured with an excitation
at 450 nm, path length of 1 cm, and concentration of 400 ppm. The
fluorescence of diluted nanoparticle solutions (20 ppm) is shown in
the Supporting Information (Figure S4).
The arrows indicate the effects of increasing the concentration of
the PTE dye.

At low concentrations
(0.5–2 wt %) of PTE (Figure 4A), the absorption spectra
showed variations in intensity because of the changes in concentration,
whereas the emission spectra (Figure 4B) showed gradual changes from monomeric to excimeric
emission accompanied with an increase in the quantum yield. At a PTE
loading of 0.5 wt %, the monomeric emission spectrum is observed with
the peaks at 488 and 521 nm. After increasing to 1.0 wt % loading,
the monomeric peak disappears entirely, and a single excimer peak
is observed at 527 nm. The emission maximum was shifted to 539 nm
at a dye concentration of 2 wt %. A further increase in concentration
of the dye loading to 5 wt % showed a decrease in emission intensity
accompanied with a bathochromic shift (∼40 nm) in emission
maximum (Figure 5).

The size, zeta potential, conductivity, quantum yield, and fluorescence
lifetime of all polymer nanoparticles were measured and tabulated
in Table 2. The hydrodynamic
particle size of the PMMA nanoparticles and PMMA–PTE nanoparticles
were 191 ± 45 and 185 ± 42 nm, respectively. The zeta potential
values of the PMMA and PMMA–PTE nanoparticles were −30
± 4 and −35 ± 1 mV, respectively. The polydispersity
of PMMA–PTE particles was in the range of 0.095–0.129,
indicating a narrow distribution of particle size. The quantum yields
of the particles ranged from 0.19 to 0.29 and were measured using
rhodamine B in ethanol as a reference and substituted in eq 1.43,44 The results
indicate that with an increase in the PTE concentration, no significant
increases in particle size, surface charge, or ion mobility were observed
(Table 2). The increasing
quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime with an increase in the concentration
of PTE show that the formation of aggregates reduces the rate of nonradiative
energy losses. This can be correlated to the restricted rotation and
movement of the encapsulated PTE dye inside the polymer matrix.45

a With respect to PMMA.

b Lifetime corresponds to two emission
maxima at 488 and 521 nm.

As the concentration of PTE was increased from 5 to 25 wt %, more
pronounced differences were observed in the photophysical properties.
In the absorption spectra (Figure 5A), an increase in intensity of the 0–1 absorption
peak at 455 nm was observed as compared to the 0–0 peak at
490 nm, indicating the aggregation of the PTE molecules inside the
PMMA matrix. The photoluminescence spectra (Figure 5B) showed the formation of perylene aggregates
with the quenching of fluorescence upon increasing the PTE loading
inside the polymer. The quenching of fluorescence was accompanied
with a bathochromic shift in emission maximum from 550 to 600 nm.
This indicates the formation of aggregates and excimers in the excited
state. The quantum yield decreases from 0.28 to 0.19, whereas the
lifetime of the particle increases from 19 to 29 ns upon increasing
the PTE loading from 5 to 25 wt %, respectively. The increasing concentration
of aggregates leads to the formation of stable excimer species with
an increase in the fluorescence lifetime, whereas the quantum yield
decreases because of ACQ.

Interaction of Nanoparticles with Mammalian
Cells
To
check on the uptake of the nanoparticles by the cells, baby hamster
kidney (BHK) cells seeded in a 24-well plate and incubated for 24
h in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) were
used as a model system. The monolayer of the cells formed was washed
thoroughly and exposed to the nanoparticle solution diluted with DMEM
to a concentration of 100, 50, 25, and 0 ppm, and the cells were incubated
for 24 h. After incubation, the excess nanoparticles were removed
by thorough washing with the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution,
and the cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol, mounted onto clean
glass slides, and imaged using a confocal microscope.

The results
collected indicated that the polymer nanoparticles permeated the cellular
membrane. The images obtained for 100, 50, and 25 ppm exposure were
found to be similar (Figure S3). At a concentration
of 25 ppm, no significant morphological changes of cells were observed.
The dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to stain
the cell nuclei to obtain a reference plane for imaging (Figure 6A). Differential
interference contrast (DIC) channel provided the morphology of the
cells [Figure 6D(iii)],
and the green channel (GFP) was used to visualize the nanoparticles
inside the cells (Figure 6B). During the imaging process, the laser intensity and exposure
levels were kept constant to obtain the accurate relative intensity
profiles of the blue and green signals. The magnified region (Figure 6D) provides a clear
visualization of nanoparticle distribution inside the cell when the
blue and green signals are overlaid (Figure 6C). The nuclear stain appears as a continuous
blue label, whereas the polymer nanoparticles appear as a punctate
stain.31

of 60× oil objective using a confocal microscope (Olympus FV1000).

Nanoprecipitated polymer particles
with encapsulated hydrophobic
dyes are often used for bioimaging. In a recent report, rhodamine-based
hydrophobic dyes were encapsulated into the PLGA nanoparticles.46 The encapsulated dye systems did not show significant
leaching into the cellular cytoplasm as compared to the commercial
cellular trackers such as LysoTracker.46 The main advantages of the PMMA–PTE nanoparticles over the
other known dye-encapsulated systems reported in the literature are
the high stability, long fluorescence lifetime, and high photostability.

Tracking of Nanoparticles in the Cell Using a Static Method
The uptake of the polymer nanoparticles into the cells was investigated
as a function of time by analyzing the exposed cells at regular time
intervals. In short, the BHK cells were seeded in a 24-well plate
(50 × 103 cells/well), and the PMMA–PTE nanoparticles
dispersed in the medium (1 mL, 25 ppm) were added to the wells. The
cells were further incubated for an hour, washed thrice with PBS to
remove the excess nanoparticles, and fixed using ice-cold methanol.
The fixed cells were stained with DAPI and placed on glass slides
for imaging. To track the location of the nanoparticles inside the
cell, the nuclear plane, stained with DAPI and imaged using the blue
channel, was considered as the frame of reference for all imaging.

The nanoparticles were imaged by illuminating the cells using the
green channel. After 1 h (Figure 7A), there was a faint green signal observed from the
nanoparticles inside the cells. After 3 h (Figure 7B), patches of green dots began to appear
at the region outside the nucleus corresponding to the dye-encapsulated
polymer nanoparticles. The time required for the internalization of
the particles matches with the values reported earlier.46 After 6 h (Figure 7C), intensive green signals were observed
around the nucleus. This indicates that the entry of nanoparticles
into the cells reaches saturation within 6 h. It is understood that
the process of internalization occurs through clathrin-dependent endocytosis
which led to the localization of the nanoparticles inside lysosomes
and endosomes.31 The internalization processes
can also be studied through flow cytometry to better estimate the
number of nanoparticles taken up by the cells.47

All images were recorded at 100× using a confocal microscope
(Olympus FV1000).

Cytotoxicity Assay
In the current study, the theoretical
concentration of SDS in the precipitated nanoparticle stock was in
the order of 10–4 wt % or 0.002 mg/mL. The reported
concentration of SDS at which cell viability is adversely affected
is around 0.01 mg/mL.48 At a low concentration
of SDS used in this study, the cytotoxic effects are negligible. After
centrifugation, the supernatant liquid was analyzed and did not show
a detectable concentration of free SDS. Therefore, it is concluded
that the SDS incorporated inside the polymer particles did not leach
out into the medium during the bioassay. The cytotoxic effects of
both PTE-loaded and pure PMMA polymer nanoparticles were determined
using the alamarBlue fluorescence assay. The assay was carried out
with three biological replicates. Each biological replicate consisted
of a set of five technical replicates, and the average values are
reported. The mean values of the data collected from the replicates
along with the standard deviation for the blank and PTE-loaded polymer
nanoparticles are shown in Figure 8.

Figure 8 AlamarBlue assay for the determination of the viability
of cells
exposed to blank (PMMA) nanoparticles and PMMA–PTE nanoparticles.

To evaluate the viability, the
background signal was first determined
from the blank wells with alamarBlue alone. The untreated cells were
used to set a baseline for viability. An additional negative control
was performed to determine whether the fluorescence from the polymer
nanoparticles would interfere with the assay. On the basis of the
fluorescence intensity of the negative control, no significant changes
in intensity were observed on the addition of the PMMA–PTE
nanoparticles.

The active agent in alamarBlue assay is resazurin,
which undergoes
reduction to form resorufin inside living cells with an enhancement
of fluorescence.49,50 This colorimetric change was
monitored using a microplate reader. The excitation wavelength used
was 535 nm, and the emission intensity was recorded at 615 nm. A background
correction was applied to all measurements to reduce the error. The
corrected measurements were normalized with respect to the controls
(no nanoparticles), and the viability of the controls was set at 100%.
On the basis of the viability assays (Figure 8), pure PMMA nanoparticles showed a cell
death greater than 30% at particle concentrations between 150 and
200 ppm. At lower concentrations (<150 ppm) of our polymer particles,
the cell death was less than 10%. The PMMA–PTE nanoparticles
showed a similar trend in toxicity as the pure PMMA particles at high
concentrations; however, the toxicity of the PTE-loaded nanoparticles
was 17 and 20% at concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm, respectively.
The PMMA–PTE nanoparticle concentration was reduced to 25 ppm
for all studies to minimize the cytotoxic damage, and at this working
concentration, clear signals from the nanoparticles inside the cells
were visualized (Figures 6 and 7).

Conclusions
The
PTE-loaded PMMA nanoparticles were synthesized by a rapid and
simple nanoprecipitation technique with the incorporation of 2 wt
% SDS to stabilize the particles. The fluorescence emission intensity
of the PMMA particles is altered by controlling the concentration
of the encapsulated PTE molecules inside the nanoparticle. Below 1
wt % PTE loading inside PMMA particles, purely monomeric emission
spectra were observed, and upon increasing PTE loading to 2–3
wt %, excimer emission with an increase in quantum yield (29%) and
lifetime (19 ns) was recorded. The fluorescent PMMA–PTE particles
were observed to internalize into the cellular cytoplasm and not inside
the nucleus. At concentrations up to 50 ppm, no significant changes
in cell viability were observed because of the presence of the polymer
nanoparticles. On average, the nanoparticles at a concentration of
25 ppm entered the cellular cytoplasm within the first 3 h of exposure.
Such nontoxic, fluorescent-tagged PMMA–PTE nanoparticles were
further modified for targeting and localization inside the cells.

Experimental
Details
Materials
All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
unless stated otherwise, and used without further purification. PMMA
(MW = 15 000), SDS, perylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic dianhydride,
acetonitrile (HPLC grade), n-bromobutane, n-butanol, and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene were obtained
from commercial sources and used without further purification for
all experiments, unless stated otherwise. Doubly distilled water was
used for the nanoprecipitation experiments.

Characterization of Synthesized
Nanoparticles
The UV–visible
spectra were measured on a UV-1800 Shimadzu UV–vis spectrophotometer
with a bandwidth of 1 nm. The emission spectra were recorded on an
Agilent Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation
wavelength corresponding to the absorption maximum of the dye. The
scanning electron micrographs were recorded using a JEOL JSM-6701F
field emission anninectron microscope. All samples were prepared by
diluting the polymer particle solution with water to a concentration
between 0.05 and 0.75 mg/mL. The samples were drop-casted on glass
coverslips, followed by the evaporation of the solvent, and were coated
with platinum before imaging. The size of the particles and zeta potentials
were measured using a Malvern Zeta Sizer instrument. The measurements
were carried out at 25 °C, with the refractive index of PMMA
set at 1.489. Time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) of all
polymer nanoparticle solutions was achieved using a Horiba (JobinYvon)
Fluorolog spectrophotometer. The lifetime measurements were recorded
using a 438 nm nanoLED source with a pulse duration of 260 ps. The
signals were collected orthogonal to the excitation source and amplified
in the axial channel using a 0.5 GHz amplifier module at the respective
emission maxima of the fluorophores. Ludox nanospheres (Sigma-Aldrich)
were used as the prompt solution to determine the instrument response
function (IRF). The transconductance amplifier capacitor filter was
adjusted to ensure a stop-to-start ratio below 2% for the fluorescent
sample to prevent the pulse pileup. Origin Pro 2016 was used for the
deconvolution of the IRF. The raw data collected from the fluorometer
were fitted to nonlinear first-order decay, after the deconvolution
of the IRF, to determine the lifetime of the probed excited state.51 The quality of the decay fit was estimated using
the R2 values. The error in the measured
lifetime because of the pulse width of the source was estimated at
±0.5 ns.

Optimization of Addition Methods
Nanoprecipitation
is a kinetically controlled process in which parameters such as the
concentration of the constituents, temperature, mixing rate, and the
presence of stabilizer influence the formation of stable particles.
The rate of addition was analyzed under two conditions—slow
injection (1–6 mL/min) of the PMMA solution (1 mL, 4 mg/mL
in acetone) into water (10 mL) and rapid pouring of the polymer solution
(4 mg/mL, 1 mL) into water (10 mL) with continuous stirring. The resultant
solution was stirred at ambient conditions for 18 h to remove the
excess acetone slowly, and the obtained particles were analyzed by
SEM to determine the morphology.

Stabilization of Particles
in Solution Using SDS
The
colloidal nanoparticles tend to undergo aggregation, flocculation,
and sedimentation.52 To prevent the aggregation
of PMMA particles, SDS (CMC = 8.2 mM) was added to introduce charges
on the surface of the particles. The stock solutions of PMMA (4 mg/mL,
MW = 15 000) and SDS (0.2–16 wt %) in acetone were prepared.
Appropriate volumes of PMMA mixed with SDS in acetone (4 mg/mL, 1
mL, MW = 15 000) were precipitated by rapidly pouring into
water. Excess surfactants cause adverse effects in biomedical applications.
To reduce the amount used, the effect of the surfactant on the stability
of the precipitated nanoparticles was examined. By varying the relative
amounts of PMMA and SDS, an optimum SDS concentration (2 wt %, 28
μM) at which the stability of nanoparticles in water is established.
The sonicated stock solution (5 mL) was rapidly added into deionized
(DI) water (50 mL). The mixture was stirred for 18 h inside a fume
hood to ensure the complete removal of acetone. The resultant nanoparticle
solution was characterized by measuring their particle size, zeta
potential, and conductivity.

Preparation of PTE-encapsulated PMMA Nanoparticles
For control experiments, the particles from pure PMMA and PTE were
prepared in separate experiments. In a typical procedure, the PMMA
(4 mg/mL; 20 mg) solution in acetone, containing SDS (2 wt %, 0.4
mg, 28 μM), was poured into DI water (50 mL). The resultant
solution was stirred for 18 h to remove acetone. The final solutions
were analyzed using the SEM and DLS instruments.

PTE was synthesized
by using a reported procedure.53 The PTE-encapsulated
PMMA nanoparticles were synthesized using the coprecipitation of PMMA
(4 mg/mL, 20 mg), SDS (2 wt %, 0.4 mg, 28 μM), and PTE (0.1–6
mg, 0.15–9.20 μmol) stock solutions in acetone (5 mL)
via rapid addition into 50 mL of water. The solutions were stirred
at ambient conditions in a fume hood for 18 h to remove excess acetone.
By considering all hydrophobic PTE molecules are encapsulated inside
the PMMA particles, a theoretical loading of 0.5–25 wt % PTE
(initial dye concentration with respect to PMMA) is expected. The
supernatant obtained after the centrifugation of the solution showed
no characteristic absorption peaks for the dye molecules. The solutions
of the particles in water were analyzed using DLS, zeta potential,
UV–vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. The nanoparticles
from pure PMMA and dye-encapsulated PMMA were compared in terms of
their colloidal stability, morphology, and visual appearance.

The quantum yield and fluorescence lifetime of all dye-encapsulated
nanoparticle solutions were determined. The quantum yield of individual
particle solutions was measured using eq 1.54 1  where Φ is the quantum yield, I is the integrated fluorescence intensity, A is the absorbance, and η is the refractive index of the medium
for the sample and reference, respectively.

The fluorescence
lifetime of the PTE-encapsulated PMMA nanoparticles
was measured using a 438 nm nanoLED and Horiba Fluorolog-3 (JobinYvon)
spectrophotometer. The samples and the prompt (LUDOX solution) were
excited with a picosecond pulse, and the emitted photons were collected
at an angle of 90° using TCSPC. The sample signals were deconvoluted
from the prompt to obtain a first-order decay fitted curve, which
was used to determine the fluorescence lifetime.

Internalization
of Nanoparticles into Mammalian Cells for Imaging
To establish
a cellular model system, BHK cells (ATCC CCL-10) were
used to understand the uptake and internalization of the dye-encapsulated
polymer nanoparticles. The polymer nanoparticle solution (400 ppm)
was filtered through a 0.5 μm sterile filter and used for further
experiments. An RPMI medium with 10% fetal calf serum was used as
the cell culture medium. In a typical procedure, the cells were seeded
on glass coverslips at a concentration of 30 × 103 cells/well, incubated for 24 h, and then exposed to nanoparticle
solutions (25–100 ppm). After 24 h of exposure, the cells were
washed with PBS, fixed with ice-cold methanol (0.5 mL, −20
°C) for 10 min, washed again with PBS, stained with DAPI, and
imaged using confocal microscopy. All experiments were carried out
in duplicates, and multiple controls were analyzed to establish the
reliability and reproducibility of the results.

Cytotoxicity
Assay
The experiments on internalization
showed that the nanoparticles can permeate the cell membrane. To determine
the cytotoxic effects of PMMA and dye-loaded PMMA nanoparticles, the
alamarBlue assay was carried out. In this assay, the active reagent
resazurin (blue) is reduced by the living cells into a pink resorufin
product, whose concentration is monitored using absorption spectroscopy.50

Both pure PMMA and PTE-encapsulated PMMA
nanoparticles were used in the study. In a typical assay, a 96-well
plate was seeded with 5000 BHK cells/well. The cells were incubated
for 24 h and exposed to polymer nanoparticle solutions at various
concentrations (50–200 ppm). After 24 h of exposure to the
nanoparticles, the cells were washed thrice with PBS solution. The
alamarBlue solution (10%, 100 μL) was added to the wells and
incubated for 2 h. After incubation, the well plates were read using
a microplate reader operating at an excitation wavelength of 535 nm
and an emission wavelength of 615 nm. The control experiments were
also carried out to gain further insight into the toxicity of the
polymer nanoparticles. The untreated cells were used as the blank
reference, the cells treated with pure polymer nanoparticles (without
perylene tetraester) served as a negative control, and the wells without
cells served as the background. Viability was determined with respect
to the blank reference.

Tracking of Polymer Nanoparticles Inside
the Cell
The
PTE-encapsulated PMMA nanoparticle solution (50 ppm, 1 mL in RPMI
media) was added to the BHK cells (50 × 103 cells/well)
seeded in 24-well plates. The cells exposed to polymer nanoparticles
were observed at 1 h intervals to get a time-dependent nanoparticle
distribution profile. The cells were fixed with methanol, stained
with DAPI, and mounted on glass slides, before imaging with confocal
microscopy.
