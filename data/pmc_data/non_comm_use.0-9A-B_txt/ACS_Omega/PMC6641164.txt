Atomic-layer-deposited
alumina (ALD Al2O3) can be utilized for passivation,
structural, and functional purposes
in electronics. In all cases, the deposited film is usually expected
to maintain chemical stability over the lifetime of the device or
during processing. However, as-deposited ALD Al2O3 is typically amorphous with poor resistance to chemical attack by
aggressive solutions employed in electronics manufacturing. Therefore,
such films may not be suitable for further processing as solvent treatments
could weaken the protective barrier properties of the film or dissolved
material could contaminate the solvent baths, which can cause cross-contamination
of a production line used to manufacture different products. On the
contrary, heat-treated, crystalline ALD Al2O3 has shown resistance to deterioration in solutions, such as standard
clean (SC) 1 and 2. In this study, ALD Al2O3 was deposited from four different precursor combinations and subsequently
annealed either at 600, 800, or 1000 °C for 1 h. Crystalline
Al2O3 was achieved after the 800 and 1000 °C
heat treatments. The crystalline films showed apparent stability in
SC-1 and HF solutions. However, ellipsometry and electron microscopy
showed that a prolonged exposure (60 min) to SC-1 and HF had induced
a decrease in the refractive index and nanocracks in the films annealed
at 800 °C. The degradation mechanism of the unstable crystalline
film and the microstructure of the film, fully stable in SC-1 and
with minor reaction with HF, were studied with transmission electron
microscopy. Although both crystallized films had the same alumina
transition phase, the film annealed at 800 °C in N2, with a less developed microstructure such as embedded amorphous
regions and an uneven interfacial reaction layer, deteriorates at
the amorphous regions and at the substrate–film interface.
On the contrary, the stable film annealed at 1000 °C in N2 had considerably less embedded amorphous regions and a uniform
Al–O–Si interfacial layer.

1 Introduction
Al2O3 deposited by atomic layer deposition
(ALD) as a protective coating has attracted considerable interest
in the past years.1−4 ALD coatings in general are highly attractive due to the conformal
nature of the deposited films. In principle, any geometry can be coated
uniformly as long as the gaseous precursors are able to diffuse to
the desired locations. Therefore, even geometries, such as pinholes
and partly sealed cavities, can be protected. Protective ALD coatings
can be applied in various areas such as (medical) microdevices2,5,6 and organic electronics.7 Besides utilizing ALD alumina films as protective
coatings, they may also be used as functional and structural layers
in microsystem manufacturing. For example, Al2O3 is known for its excellent stability as a plasma etching mask material
in high-aspect-ratio micromachining.8,9

Al2O3 thin films can be exposed to various
wet chemistries regardless of whether the films are utilized as protective
coatings or as functional layers. Especially, the standard Radio Corporation
of America (RCA) clean is highly relevant for commercial production
of devices in a clean room environment.10,11 The RCA clean
is routinely applied in manufacturing to clean surfaces from contaminants.
In addition to the water rinsing and drying steps, the RCA clean consists
of standard clean 1 (SC-1, ammonium hydroxide and hydrogen peroxide),
dilute hydrofluoric acid (HF), and standard clean 2 (SC-2, hydrochloric
acid and hydrogen peroxide) solvent dips, which are all highly aggressive
solutions. These solutions may deteriorate the coatings and hence
either contaminate processing tools by introducing metallic contamination
into the baths or decrease the barrier capability of the film. Contaminant
Al on silicon wafers can cause deviation in the thermal oxidation
rates of Si and fixed negative charge in the SiO2, altering
transistor performance.12,13 Cross-contamination
is an especially large concern in foundry-type manufacturing where
several different products may be processed within the same facilities.
Therefore, Al2O3 that goes through processing
should be fully stable and not dissolve into the cleaning baths. Furthermore,
the redeposition of Al on Si has been shown to be directly proportional
to the amount of contaminant Al in SC-1.13

ALD alumina has already displayed potential as a thin-film
material
with a low etch rate in a variety of solutions including SC-2;14 however, in general, the as-deposited ALD Al2O3 films tend to be amorphous15 and unstable in many solutions. For example, as-deposited
ALD Al2O3 has been reported to be susceptible
to water corrosion.1,4,7 Nevertheless,
the etch rates of ALD alumina in different solutions have distinctly
varied depending on the film deposition parameters and the annealing
temperature.14 Both the deposition and
the annealing temperature have been determined to be significant when
fabricating chemically stable ALD alumina thin films.1,14 The elevated temperature treatments cause the amorphous microstructure
of ALD alumina to densify and to change its composition.16 Thermal treatments at elevated temperatures
lead to phase transformations of alumina and to a reduced degree of
hydration.17−19 The resulting microstructure may contribute to the
chemical stability of the ALD alumina coatings. Consequently, crystalline
ALD alumina films have been found resistant to H2SO4,1,14,20 high-purity
water,1 KCl,1 KOH,1 SC-1, SC-2,14 and other chemicals relevant in microfabrication.14 However, none of the previous studies have analyzed
in detail whether Al is nevertheless dissolved in minor quantities
or whether some degree of damage is present in the films despite the
films being apparently resistant to chemical attack. Furthermore,
the microstructure of the stable, crystalline films has not been determined
unambiguously and the deterioration mechanisms of unstable films are
not comprehensively understood.

The objective of this study
is to deposit and thermally treat ALD
Al2O3 to obtain chemically stable films. The
alumina films are tested in deionized water (DIW), SC-1, and HF cleaning
solutions. The films are evaluated on the basis of changes in their
thicknesses and refractive indices. The obtained etching rate data
of soluble films may be exploited in micromachining too. The microstructures
of the films are correlated with the chemical stability of the stable
and unstable films. Furthermore, the degree of structural damage in
the unstable films is evaluated with comprehensive scanning and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) studies. Finally, mass spectrometry (MS)
is utilized to investigate the amount of solute Al contamination in
the SC-1 and HF solutions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Al2O3 Films and Annealing
Al2O3 films were deposited from four precursor
combinations. Table 1 presents information about the Al2O3 ALD films.

a The measurements represent the average
of 24 ellipsometry points from one wafer in each batch of 25 wafers.
All films were visually inspected for deviations in color and obvious
defects. Nonuniformities were calculated by subtracting the minimum
value from the maximum and dividing by two times the average . Negligible
standard deviations (SDs) were
measured for the refractive indices but the errors can be approximated
to be ± 0.01.

Most
notably, the GPC values of the TMA-O3- and TMA-H2O-O3-based films were high compared to those of
the films deposited at 450 °C. The GPC of a saturated TMA-H2O process at 300 °C has been reported to lie between
0.08 and 0.1 nm/cycle.14,21 However, TMA begins to decompose
at around 370 °C, which could, in principle, induce chemical
vapor deposition type film growth.22 However,
it has been found though that the increased temperature decreases
the concentration of reactive OH groups at the surface of Al2O3.21 Therefore, it seems that
the lower growth rate in the high-temperature processes is at least
partly caused by the decreased number of reactive surface sites. Nevertheless,
the GPC values and refractive indices are well in line with the previous
research and comparable to those in similar processes.14 Finally, the nonuniformity of the AlCl3-based film was high and could be an issue in applications relying
on strict thickness uniformity requirements.

All films presented
in Table 1 underwent
a thermal treatment at 1000 °C in a
vacuum furnace. Furthermore, the TMA-H2O-based films were
also annealed at 600, 800, and 1000 °C in a N2 environment.
Therefore, additional rows are present in the case of TMA-H2O in Table 2, which
presents thickness and refractive index data of the annealed films.
The TMA-H2O films were selected for further characterization
because the deposition behavior (Table 1), the annealing experiments (Table 2), and the etching experiments of the as-deposited
films (Table 3), presented
later, did not give reasons to assume that any of the other films
would outperform the TMA-H2O-based films in terms of low
nonuniformity, increase in refractive index (indication of increased
density23), and chemical stability. Furthermore,
because the TMA-H2O precursor combination is so thoroughly
studied, it comes out as a more attractive precursor combination for
ALD Al2O3 compared to the other precursor combinations
in terms of being a more mature candidate for foundry-type manufacturing
environments.

a Empty space and
hyphens indicate
that no experiment was conducted (the etch rate columns) or that the
film was in the as-deposited state (the annealing temperature column).
The second reported values in the SC-1 etch rate column are from the
N2 annealing experiment encompassing also a repeated as-deposited
TMA-H2O-based film SC-1 etching experiment. All heat-treated
samples used in the HF etch rate experiments were annealed in N2.

b The test was continued
for 24 h
after which the films showed a very minor thickness increase of ≤1
nm.

c The films started to
swell after
60 min.

d The film started
to swell after
15 min.

The thicknesses
of the films decreased, except for the annealing
at 600 °C in N2, whereas the refractive indices increased,
indicating compaction of the films.14,17 The refractive
index of bulk sapphire is above 1.75 at the wavelength of 632.8 nm.24 Values similar to these values have been reported
after high-temperature treatments of ALD Al2O3 films.14 The large deviation in the thickness
decrease of the AlCl3-based film stems from the originally
high nonuniformity.

The surfaces of the films were also investigated
with atomic force
microscopy (AFM) and optical microscopy. Figures 1 and 2 highlight the
observations. The average root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughnesses
of the films in the as-deposited state were 0.3–0.4 nm averaged
from three locations on each film. Similar averaged RMS roughnesses
were not obtained from the vacuum-annealed films because the high
number of blisters (Figure 2) distorted the results. Nevertheless, the roughnesses of
the films increased due to the annealing. Furthermore, as shown in Figure 2, bright circular
defects, blisters, appeared on all of the films after the vacuum annealing.
The optical micrographs were identical for all films with the same
treatments, that is, vacuum-annealed; blistered films showed white
dots and nonblistered films, including annealed and as-deposited films,
displayed a deep shade of blue with no obvious defects. Blisters did
not appear after the nitrogen atmosphere annealing, and the optical
micrographs were identical to those of as-deposited films. Blisters
have been observed in various other studies too.25 The blisters are caused by the local delamination and subsequent
bulging of the film. Stress and any gases trapped at the film–Si
interface probably play a role.25,26 Therefore, a vacuum
atmosphere may exacerbate the driving force of the blister formation.
Further efforts were placed on characterizing the TMA-H2O films annealed in nitrogen because the nitrogen atmosphere annealing
did not cause blistering.

°C vacuum-annealed

The increased surface roughness is evident.

2.2 Chemical Stability
The chemical stability
of the films was investigated by immersing them into various solutions
typically employed in wafer cleaning (DIW, SC-1, and HF). The thicknesses
and refractive indices of the films were measured over regular intervals.
The thickness data after 1 min of immersion were used to construct
the etching rates presented in Table 3. The chip sizes were 2 × 2 cm2. Six
ellipsometry measurements were taken from each chip.

The etching
data show that none of the as-deposited films would be stable during
the RCA cleaning as the etch rates in SC-1 and HF are on the order
of 20 nm/min. The films annealed at 1000 °C in both atmospheres
and additionally the TMA-H2O film annealed at 800 °C
in N2 seem to be stable over a short period of time of
similar magnitude as in cleaning baths. The etch rates of the stable
films rounded to 1 nm did not show apparent etching in SC-1 and HF
after 1 min; however, the ellipsometry showed thickness decreases
of some angstroms, indicating that a surface layer, such as a contaminant
carbon or hydroxylated layer, had been etched.

Furthermore,
prolonged exposure of 60 min to SC-1 and HF started
to impose optical changes on the TMA-H2O film annealed
at 800 °C in N2. The TMA-H2O annealing
series etching results are visualized in Figure 3, which presents the thickness change and
refractive index data in graphs. The film annealed at 800 °C
was not fully stable, indicated by the slight increase in thicknesses
and the decrease in refractive indices after 60 min of immersion in
both SC-1 and HF. The effects are slightly more pronounced in HF.

Figure 3 Changes
in thicknesses and refractive indices of TMA-H2O films
as a function of immersion time in (a) SC-1 and (b) HF. The
dashed lines represent the thickness changes and the solid lines represent
the refractive indices. The SDs of the thickness data were on the
order of maximum 1 nm. The refractive index errors can be approximated
to be ±0.01. The increases in the thicknesses of the films annealed
at 800 °C after 60 min were 3 and 5 nm for the SC-1 and HF treatments,
respectively.

The concentrations of
the dissolved Al in the SC-1 and HF etchants
were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma MS (ICP-MS). Table 4 presents these results.

Table 4 ICP-MS-Measured Al Concentrations
in SC-1 and HF after 10 min of Etching Each Samplea

1000 °C	80 ± 20	70 ± 20	
reference	80 ± 20	60 ± 20	
a “Reference” means
that the solution was kept in the beaker for 10 min without any sample.
The solutions were prepared separately for each experiment. SC-1 temperature
was 80 °C, and HF was at room temperature (21 °C). Chip
sizes were 3 × 3 and 2 × 2 cm2 in SC-1 and HF,
respectively. The error limits represent the expanded uncertainty
and were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (2σ).

Four observations can be made from
the ICP-MS results. First, both
as-deposited and 600 °C annealed samples showed the same concentrations
of Al in the etchants as expected due to the complete dissolution
of the films. Second, both reference solutions contained Al. In the
case of the SC-1 experiment, some of the Al can originate from the
borosilicate glass beaker where Al is a common alloying element in
small quantities. However, the HF experiments were conducted in a
plastic beaker. Third, the Al concentration is slightly higher, although
within error limits, in HF in the 1000 °C annealed sample compared
to that in the 800 °C annealed sample, which has the same concentration
of the reference solution. Finally, the Al concentrations of the 800
and 1000 °C samples in SC-1 are the same as those in the reference
solution. On the basis of the ICP-MS results, it may be deducted that
the solubility of Al from 800 and 1000 °C N2 annealed
Al2O3 in SC-1 is little to none within the precision
of the test setup. Both films would then be suitable for SC-1 and
HF cleaning solutions.

2.3 Structure
The
alumina films are expected
to crystallize from amorphous through transition aluminas to corundum
(α-Al2O3). The proposed temperature-dependent
sequence is amorphous: → γ → δ →
θ → α-Al2O3; however, other
possibilities exist too depending on the starting material.19 On the basis of the X-ray diffraction (XRD)
results in Figure 4, the N2 annealing crystallized the TMA-H2O
films into the monoclinic θ-alumina at 800 and 1000 °C.
The reported phase transformation temperatures of the θ phase
correspond to those used in this study.19 Another possibility, with respect to the transformation temperature,
could be the κ phase, which provided a reasonable fit to the
XRD data, although not as good as the θ fit (see Figure S4). The thermal treatments caused densification
and increased surface roughness of the films at 800 and 1000 °C
(Table 5). The films
became polycrystalline with a preferred orientation because many of
the strong peaks expected for an isotropically oriented powder were
absent in the grazing incidence XRD (GIXRD) geometry scans (see Figure S4). The density fits of the X-ray reflectivity
(XRR) at 800 and 1000 °C correspond to the reported density of
the θ phase, whereas the κ phase should have a considerably
higher density (3.98 g/cm3).19 Finally, the XRR roughness values can be seen to increase after
crystallization.

TMA-H2O films. From top to bottom: 1000 °C (blue),

TMA-H2O-based Al2O3 films were
imaged with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The imaged films included
the as-deposited, 800 °C N2, 1000 °C N2, as-deposited 50 °C DIW 45 min, and 800 and 1000 °C N2 annealed films submerged in SC-1 and HF solutions for 60
min. Figure 5 presents
the most important observations (as-deposited and DIW-tested film
SEM images can be found in the Supporting Information). The as-deposited film was completely smooth with no observable
features. The as-deposited film submerged in DIW for 45 min had developed
a similar petal morphology as observed by Correa et al.1 and Kim et al.7 In
fact, the morphology was almost fully identical to the one in the
images presented by Kim et al.7 On the
basis of the ellipsometry, ICP-MS, and SEM results, the as-deposited
films are not suitable for further processing that would include the
full RCA clean.

Figure 5 SEM surface micrographs of TMA-H2O films after
various
treatments. The 800 °C (a) and 1000 °C (b) annealed films
displayed a distinct difference in their surface morphology. The 800
°C annealed films in SC-1 (c) and HF (e) after 60 min had developed
cracks and distinct differences in the surface contrast. The 1000
°C annealed films in SC-1 (d) and HF (f) after 60 min did not
display cracks. The inset in (f) displays the boundary area of the
two different contrast zones. Note that image (f) has a considerably
different magnification compared to that of the other images to highlight
the relevant observations.

The surfaces of the nitrogen atmosphere annealed films had
developed
features that were observable in SEM, with the morphology being rougher
in the case of 1000 °C annealing. Figure 3 showed that the films annealed at 800 °C
and submerged for 1 h in the SC-1 or HF had measurable changes in
their thicknesses and clear changes in their refractive indices. The
SEM images further revealed clear changes in these films: the films
had changed surface characteristics (pronounced contrast differences)
and nanocracks (Figure 5c,e). The increased contrast at the surface may originate from changes
in surface topography and material density. The decrease in the refractive
indices and the increase in thicknesses indicate that the films have
become less dense. If the films have undergone hydroxylation or other
structural changes, the films may have expanded in volume, causing
cracking. ALD Al2O3 films tend to be in a biaxial
tensile stress in their as-deposited state at room temperature.28 Additional stress caused by the volume expansion
of hydroxide products together with the internal stress of the films
may be the root cause for the nanocracks. Nevertheless, it is obvious
that although only small changes were observed with ellipsometry,
the prolonged aggressive solvent exposure had caused structural changes
in the 800 °C annealed films. On the contrary, no nanocracks,
or any change in the ellipsometry data, were observed in the films
annealed at 1000 °C in N2. However, HF seems to have
attacked the 1000 °C annealed film in localized areas on the
surface. It is unclear whether the dark or light contrast areas, or
neither, represent the original surface. It is possible that the films
that have obvious contrast changes at the surface (Figure 5c,e,f) have undergone a dissolution–precipitation
process theorized by Correa et al.1 That
is, the less dense surface of the films may have reacted with the
solutions forming aluminum hydroxides, which have subsequently precipitated
on the surfaces of the films.

The evolution of structure and
the degree of damage in the films
was further investigated by preparing cross-sectional TEM samples
of the films in Figure 5. Figures 6–9 present the
most relevant observations. The as-deposited TMA-H2O film
was found amorphous, as expected based on the literature (Figure 6).15 However, the native oxide of Si was not resolved at the
interface in contrast to the literature.7,29 However, the
ALD temperature was considerably higher in this study. Furthermore,
TMA is known to be a highly reducing agent, which is why it is such
an effective ALD precursor too.30 Therefore,
it is possible that the native oxide has reacted during the growth,
giving rise to a sharp interface between the Si substrate and the
growing film, at least within the context of TEM phase contrast imaging
(see Figure 6b). The
Si–Al2O3 interface had evolved due to
the annealing (Figures 6–8, Si–Al2O3 interfaces). Interdiffusion had taken place at the higher temperatures
(i.e., at least at 800 and 1000 °C), and an Al-Si-O compound
had formed between the crystalline alumina and Si (see Figure S7). The thickness of the interfacial
layer has remained at sub-10 nm after 1000 °C annealing. It is
noteworthy that the interfacial layer was found uniform in the sample
annealed at 1000 °C with a constant thickness along the lamella,
whereas the interfacial layer after 800 °C annealing did not
have a constant thickness (e.g., Figure 7, high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image where
alumina lattice fringes extend to Si). Similar observations regarding
the growth of interfacial layers have been made in other studies.
Klie et al.31 have shown a thin layer of
SiO2 to form during annealing when an oxygen-rich (O/Al
ratio 2.1) alumina thin film was deposited on a Si substrate with
no native oxide. Furthermore, Kim and Hwang32 have shown that a thin layer of Al silicate can form between the
Si substrate and the alumina film due to annealing. Finally, Zhang
et al.30 also observed an interfacial layer,
whose energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) spectrum showed Al,
O, and Si, via HRTEM to grow between the Si substrate and alumina
after high-temperature annealing. In their study, the ALD alumina
was crystallized on Si(111) substrates at over 1000 °C with rapid
thermal annealing and showed the α-Al2O3(012) XRD peak. Therefore, regardless of the obtained alumina phase,
it is likely that a thin reaction layer will form between the alumina
film and the Si substrate. However, it is noteworthy that the excess
concentration of elements beyond the stoichiometric Al2O3 ratio may affect the formation of the layer.

orientation for the crystallized alumina with θ-alumina (201̅)
planes along the Si[002] direction. HRTEM images (c, d) show the Si–Al2O3 interface and the Al2O3 surface, respectively. (e) DF STEM overview image shows that the
Si–Al2O3 interface is uniform and that
little to no amorphous regions are in the film.

Figure 9 TEM images of the sample annealed in N2 at 800 °C
and kept in SC-1 for 60 min. (a) BFTEM image taken with the zero-order
beam at a defect site shows that most of the chemical attack has taken
place at the substrate interface. The γ value of the image has
been modified to highlight the defect in the film. HRTEM images of
the defect site at the surface (b) and the substrate interface (c).
The extent of damage is evident in the DF STEM image (d).

The preferential orientation of the films was investigated
with
SAED and HRTEM. Figures 7 and 8 show that the films annealed at 800
and 1000 °C had crystallized with a preferred orientation of
stacked θ-Al2O3{201̅} planes on
the Si(100) surface. In the SAED patterns of Figure 7a inset and Figure 8b, the θ 201̅ reflections are
not completely aligned with the Si 002 reflections, indicating some
rotation of the preferentially oriented grains. Therefore, the GIXRD
scans (i.e., nonsymmetrical XRD scans) also showed the 201̅
peaks as the area that is illuminated in XRD is much larger compared
to that in SAED, leading to a higher probability of illuminating the
highly tilted grains too. Finally, the d spacings
of the 201̅ reflections were calculated based on the Si 002
type reflections, that is, the length measurement was calibrated with
the Si unit cell, which gave a good match to the d spacing of the 201̅ XRD peak.

The film annealed at 800
°C and tested in SC-1 for 1 h showed
bright areas extending across the film in the bright-field images
(Figure 9). The bright
contrast was broadened at the Si interface. These areas obviously
scattered the electron beam less compared to that from the rest of
film.
The interfacial reaction layer was highly modified at these areas
compared with the film annealed at 800 °C that had not undergone
testing in SC-1 (HRTEM images of Figure 7 vs Figure 9). Furthermore, the DF STEM in Figure 9 showed similarly that the film had undergone
alterations at localized points at the substrate interface with some
of the areas having clear but narrow paths toward the film surface.
It is reasonable to assume that the locations where a clear path toward
the surface was seen correlate with the nanocracks observed in the
SEM topography images. The dark areas in the DF STEM images indicate
regions that scatter the electron beam less, meaning either lower Z number elements and/or lower density such as amorphous
regions. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that those areas have
reacted with the SC-1 solution, resulting in an amorphous reaction
product. Likewise, the HRTEM images of the SC-1-treated sample (Figure 9b,c) showed no lattice
fringes in the reacted areas (both visual and fast Fourier transform
inspection were used).

The film annealed at 1000 °C has
more developed grains with
less defects and grain boundaries compared to those in the film annealed
at 800 °C. It is thermodynamically beneficial for small grains
to grow, for which the increased temperature provides the kinetics.
The increased density indicated by XRR also supports such notions.
Furthermore, the grain boundaries themselves may have become denser
and with less impurities, such as residual carbon arising from the
TMA precursor during deposition, after 1000 °C annealing compared
to 800 °C annealing.33,34 Nevertheless, the most
noticeable difference between the samples annealed at 800 and 1000
°C is that the number and size of the embedded amorphous regions
have considerably decreased (Figure 7c vs Figure 8e). Therefore, we propose that in the 800 °C annealed
film the solvents diffuse through the less stable grain boundaries/amorphous
regions extending from the surface of the film to the substrate interface.
The solvents then react both at the amorphous regions and at the interface.
For example, Oda and Yoshio35 have shown
that the corrosion of ceramic α-Al2O3 mainly
proceeded at the grain boundaries by the dissolution of SiO2 and Na2O impurities. The reaction product is less dense
and will cause the refractive index to decrease although the effect
on the thickness of the film is only some nanometers. The reactions
inside the amorphous regions and at the interface likely also caused
some volumetric increase, which in turn caused cracking visible in
the SEM images; however, some of the secondary electron contrast may
also come from the different density of the reacted boundaries.

3 Conclusions
ALD Al2O3 films were shown to be unstable
in the amorphous state in DIW and SC-1, whereas heat-treated, crystalline
Al2O3 films showed stability in DIW, SC-1, and
HF. The crystalline films were realized by annealing alumina, deposited
from TMA and H2O at 450 °C, at 800 and 1000 °C.
The films crystallized with a preferential orientation to the monoclinic
θ-Al2O3 phase, where the {201̅}
planes were stacked on the (100)Si substrate. However, although the
800 °C annealed film was apparently stable according to the ellipsometry
measurements during the first minutes of immersion, electron microscopy
showed nanocracks on the film after 60 min of exposure to SC-1 and
HF. On the contrary, the film annealed at 1000 °C was completely
stable and its surface was unaffected after 60 min in SC-1, and with
little modification after 60 min in HF. The deterioration of the 800 °C
annealed film had taken place at embedded amorphous regions and at
the substrate–film interface. The 1000 °C N2-annealed film, fully stable in SC-1 and with minor reaction with
HF, did not show dissolved Al in ICP-MS within the precision of the
test setup. The films should be crystallized to process ALD Al2O3 in a manufacturing environment with strict requirements
of purity levels. In addition, the crystalline quality needs to be
sufficient (volumetric ratio of amorphous regions to crystalline regions
should be minimized). Such requirements impose limitations in terms
of thermal budget as the lowest possible crystallization temperature
may require long annealing times to drive the crystallization of Al2O3 films to a sufficient fraction to preserve it
from degradation. Furthermore, if the ALD Al2O3 is used as a barrier layer, it would be likewise beneficial to drive
the grain growth to the complete thermodynamic equilibrium. Crystallization
kinetics studies of ALD Al2O3 would provide
beneficial knowledge required to fully control the grain nucleation
and growth.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 ALD and
Annealing
Four different
precursor combinations based on TMA, AlCl3, H2O, and ozone were used in the ALD of the Al2O3 films. All of the films were deposited in a batch reactor (Beneq
P400A) with 25 wafers in each run. The films were dual-side deposited
on 150 mm single-side-polished (100)Si wafers with the native oxides.
Three of the processes were binary, TMA-H2O, TMA-O3, and AlCl3-H2O, with alternating pulses
of the metal precursor and the oxygen source. A purge cycle was applied
between each step. One process, TMA-H2O-O3,
was a ternary process without a purge sequence between the H2O and O3 pulses. The deposition temperatures were selected
to produce as high purity films as possible and were ≥300 °C
in all cases. The impurity content depends on the deposition temperature,
with a higher temperature usually leading to a higher purity in the
case of ALD Al2O3 as long as the deposition
is carried out within the process window for the particular set of
precursors.36,37

The annealing tests were
conducted in two parts. A fresh film/wafer was used in each test,
that is, no film endured two sequential temperature treatments. First,
all of the Al2O3 films were annealed for 1 h
(dwell time at the maximum temperature) at 1000 °C under high
vacuum (HV) conditions (ptot < 10–6 mbar) in a furnace (Webb Red Devil M). The heating
ramp rate was 10 °C/min, and cooling was achieved through natural
heat dissipation. Second, one of the films (precursor combinations)
was selected for a set of thermal treatments based on its as-deposited
quality (e.g., low nonuniformity), thermal behavior (e.g., increase
in refractive index), and etching experiments (low etch rate in SC-1).
The set consisted of annealing at temperatures of 600, 800, and 1000
°C for a 1 h dwell time in a N2 environment. The N2 environment was dictated by the furnace (PEO-603) that was
used due to its higher purity classification within the research facilities.
Furthermore, nitrogen is an inert gas well-suited for crystallization
experiments because it is not expected to react with oxides that are
more stable than the corresponding nitride compounds (e.g., Al2O3 vs AlN). The heating ramp rate was 15 °C/min,
and the cooling rate was 13 °C/min.

4.2 Etching
Experiments
The etching experiments
were carried out in a fume hood inside a clean room. Borosilicate
beakers (Schott Duran) were utilized in precleaning steps, DIW, and
SC-1 experiments, whereas beakers made of polypropylene were used
in experiments involving HF. The sample holder in all of the experiments
was ethylene tetrafluoroethylene. Before the immersion into the etchant,
the samples were prewashed in acetone, isopropanol, and DIW for 5
s in each solution. The etchant was kept at a desired temperature
using a hot plate. The temperature of the heated etchants (i.e., not
HF) was monitored using a thermometer. The samples were rinsed in
DIW and dried with a nitrogen blow gun after the etching experiments.

The SC-1 solution consisted of 500 mL of DIW and 100 mL of aqueous
NH4OH (29 wt % NH3). The liquids were mixed
in a glass beaker and heated on a hot plate to a sub-target temperature.
Aqueous H2O2 (140 mL, 30%) was added after that,
and the complete solution was heated to the target temperature. The
SC-1 temperature was 80 °C except when the activation energy
of the etching mechanism was studied. The HF solution was prepared
by mixing 500 mL of DIW and 10 mL of aqueous HF (50 wt % HF) in a
plastic beaker at room temperature (21 °C). DIW experiments were
conducted at 38 and 50 °C.

4.3 Thin-Film
and Solvent Characterization
Ellipsometry (Plasmos SD2300)
was used to measure the thicknesses
and refractive indices of the films. A He–Ne laser (632.8 nm)
was used as the light source. The angle of incidence was fixed to
70°.

An AFM (Digital Instruments Dimension 3100) was used
to characterize the surface roughnesses of the films before and after
annealing in the HV environment. Optical microscopy was used to visually
inspect for defects on the films. Especially of interest were possible
cracks or other similar defects after the thermal treatments. SEM
(Zeiss Sigma VP) surface characterization was conducted using an in-column
secondary electron detector at a 2 kV acceleration voltage.

GIXRD at the grazing angle of ω = 0.6° and XRR analyses
were carried out with an X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku SmartLab) equipped
with a 9 kW rotating Cu anode source. The incident beam was monochromatized
using a multilayer mirror and a Ge(220) double-bounce monochromator
in both the GIXRD and XRR measurements. The measured XRR curves were
fitted using in-house-developed software.38 The fitting routine was used to extract the thicknesses, densities,
and roughnesses of the films. Some etched samples were selected based
on the SEM characterization for further TEM inspection. The thin foil
preparation was performed using focused ion beam (FIB, FEI Quanta
3D 200i and Helios NanoLab 600) systems. TEM studies were conducted
at 200 kV (JEOL JEM-2800).

ICP-MS (Thermo Fisher Scientific
iCAP Q) was carried out to analyze
the solute Al in the SC-1 and HF solvents used to etch the films.
Nitric acid (HNO3) digestion was used in the sample preparation
to assure that the aluminum in the solvents was in the ionic form.
Measurements were carried out using the SFS-EN ISO 17294-2 standard.
