Peritoneal adhesion is a common postoperative
complication that
causes many kinds of organ dysfunctions. It can be minimized by the
integration of physical isolation and pharmaceutical treatment. However,
the gas permeability of traditional medical devices for adhesion prevention
is not satisfactory, which increases the risk of infection and inflammation,
thus facilitating the formation of peritoneal adhesion. In this study,
a device of porous polylactide (PLA) film plus atorvastatin (ATV)-loaded
thermogel was developed for peritoneal adhesion prevention. PLA film
acted as a physical barrier to prevent the connection of fibrin bridges
between the injured tissues and nearby normal organs. Simultaneously,
ATV was released to achieve the antifibrin deposition and anti-inflammatory
effect. The porous properties of PLA film and thermogel increased
the gas permeability and further inhibited the inflammatory responses.
The in vivo study demonstrated that the porous PLA film with ATV-loaded
thermogel possessed excellent anti-inflammation ability and satisfactory
antiadhesion capacity, indicating its great potential for clinical
application.

1 Introduction
Peritoneal
adhesion, characterized by proliferated fibrin bands
connecting the injured tissues and nearby normal organs, is a very
common postoperative complication that often occurs after various
peritoneal surgeries.1,2 The adhesion bands can be classified
into a diversity of types ranging from thin fibrous films to a complex
of fibrous bridges, blood vessels, and nerves.3,4 Peritoneal
adhesion can lead to many physical problems in the patients, including
chronic abdominal pain, bowel obstruction, infertility, and organ
dysfunction.5,6

Even though many efforts
have been made to inhibit peritoneal adhesion,
such as physical isolation and pharmaceutical treatment, the exact
pathophysiology is not fully understood. Many factors, involving peritoneal
injuries, foreign materials, and local inflammation and infection,
are thought to be associated with the formation of peritoneal adhesion.7,8 Until now, local inflammation has been considered as the main cause
of peritoneal adhesion.9,10 Specifically, our body would
probably assume that we are in a severe trauma after undergoing surgeries,
which triggers the release of vasodilators, histamine, and various
cytokines.1 The permeability of blood vessels
would be subsequently increased, leading to the effusion of fibrous
tissues. When fibrin deposition effect is greater than fibrin degradation
effect, fibrous bands will form and peritoneal adhesion will occur.3

With the development of tissue engineering,
physical isolation
based on biocompatible and biodegradable polymer materials, as well
as combined utilization with antifibrin proliferation or anti-inflammation
drugs, has attracted much attention in adhesion prevention.

The physical barriers, such as Seprafilm11 and Interceed,12 mainly prevent the adhesion
formation by simply separating the injured tissues from adjacent normal
organs, but have no effect on the inhibition of excessive deposition
of fibrous tissues or inflammatory responses. Besides, the gas permeability
of traditional physical barriers is poor, which may form a suitable
environment for the proliferation of anaerobic bacteria and increase
the possibility of infection and inflammatory responses. In addition,
poor gas permeability will result in the deposition of excessive fibrous
tissues and the formation of peritoneal adhesion, which are not beneficial
for wound healing.13

For pharmaceutical
treatment, drugs that can inhibit fibrin proliferation
and inflammatory responses are often used for peritoneal adhesion
prevention. For example, atorvastatin (ATV) that is usually applied
for the treatment of high blood cholesterol has been reported to reduce
the amounts of peritoneal fibrin bands14,15 and inhibit
the expression of inflammatory factors.16 However, the formation of fibrous bands cannot be completely inhibited
by single pharmaceutical treatment, and the residual fibrous films
can still induce peritoneal adhesion.10 So, integrating pharmaceutical treatment and physical isolation
and increasing the gas permeability of the combined medical devices
may provide better adhesion inhibition efficacy.

Herein, a device
of porous polylactide (PLA) film with ATV-loaded
thermogel was developed for the treatment of peritoneal adhesion (Scheme 1). PLA film functions
as a physical barrier to separate the connection of fibrous bands
between the injured areas and nearby normal tissues. In addition,
the porous PLA membrane possessed high gas permeability, which might
well inhibit the infection and inflammatory responses in the injured
areas. For antifibrin proliferation and anti-inflammatory effect,
ATV was loaded in a designed thermogel and could be continuously released.
Furthermore, the thermogel also contained interconnected pores to
increase gas permeability. Owing to the well-designed structure, the
combination of porous PLA film and ATV-loaded thermogel might be a
good solution for peritoneal adhesion prevention.

2 Results
2.1 Characterizations
of Membranes Plus Thermogel
The PLA film, porous PLA film,
PLA film with thermogel, PLA film
with ATV-loaded thermogel, porous PLA film with thermogel, and porous
PLA film with ATV-loaded thermogel were referred to as PFilm, PPFilm,
PFilm+Gel, PFilm+Gel/ATV, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV, respectively.
PFilm+Gel, PFilm+Gel/ATV, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV were successfully
developed. Because of the temperature sensitivity, this thermogel
was in liquid state at 4 °C and turned to solid at body temperature.
In addition, the ATV-loaded thermogel was stable and homogeneous owing
to the excellent solubility of ATV in thermogel solution at 4 °C.

The water vapor transmission rates (WVTRs) of PFilm and PPFilm
were 616.86 ± 80.23 and 2101.49 ± 227.52 g m–2 day–1, respectively. There was a significant difference
between PFilm and PPFilm in WVTR, which indicated that PPFilm possessed
better gas permeability in this study (P < 0.001).

The detailed morphologies of PFilm, PFilm+Gel, PPFilm, and PPFilm+Gel
are shown in Figure 1A. PFilm showed smooth surface without obvious pores, whereas oval
pores could be seen evenly distributed in PPFilm (Figure 1A). The pore size and porosity
of PPFilm were about 1 μm and 75%, respectively. Furthermore,
these pores were interconnected with each other. For PFilm+Gel and
PPFilm+Gel, thermogel was coated on the surface of PFilm or PPFilm,
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Inspect-F, FEI, Finland) images
mainly represented the thermogel morphologies. The thermogel displayed
highly porous and interconnected structure.

The stress–strain curves
of PFilm, PFilm+Gel, PPFilm, and
PPFilm+Gel were evaluated and are shown in Figure 1B. The curves of PFilm+Gel and PPFilm+Gel
were above those of PFilm and PPFilm, which indicated that the thermogel-coated
membranes possessed a stronger deformation-resistant ability than
uncoated ones. In addition, the curves of PFilm and PFilm+Gel were
above those of PPFilm and PPFilm+Gel. There were significant differences
between PFilm and PFilm+Gel, PPFilm and PPFilm+Gel, and PFilm+Gel
and PPFilm+Gel in tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and elongation
at break (Figure 1B).

Water contact angle tests indicated that the four separating films
were all hydrophilic and the water contact angles of PFilm, PFilm+Gel,
PPFilm, and PPFilm+Gel were 50.01 ± 1.62, 41.71 ± 2.82,
38.41 ± 2.42, and 37.65 ± 6.32°, respectively.

2.2 In vitro Degradation
The degradation
of PFilm, PPFilm, and Gel/ATV was performed separately. Figure 1C,D shows the degradation profiles
of PFilm, PPFilm, PFilm+Gel/ATV, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) or elastase solution. After degradation for 30 days,
the weight losses of PFilm, PPFilm, PFilm+Gel/ATV, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
in PBS were 19.82 ± 1.03, 24.27 ± 1.69, 21.45 ± 1.66,
and 23.68 ± 1.52 wt %, respectively, whereas the weight losses
of PFilm, PPFilm, PFilm+Gel/ATV, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV in elastase solution
were 46.62 ± 2.04, 54.53 ± 2.94, 53.64 ± 0.11, and
55.59 ± 2.22 wt %, respectively. There were no obvious differences
in degradation properties among PPFilm, PFilm+Gel/ATV, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
in either PBS or elastase solution. But the degradation rate of PPFilm
on day 30 was higher than that of PFilm in both incubation media (P < 0.05).

2.3 In vitro Drug Release
The release
profiles of ATV from thermogel in PBS and elastase solution are shown
in Figure 1E. Burst
releases of 24.76 ± 1.35 and 36.17 ± 1.57% were detected
during the first 6 days in PBS and elastase solution. Afterward, ATV
was continuously and slowly released in the two incubation solutions
for another 24 days. After a total of 30 days, about 86% of ATV was
released in elastase solution, significantly higher than 62% in PBS
(P < 0.01).

2.4 Animal
Studies
The cecum abrasion
animal model was successfully established in our study. All of the
mice recovered well after surgery and none of them died before being
sacrificed. All animals were kept in clean and ventilated cages with
necessary human care. They were sacrificed 14 days post surgery, and
the peritoneal adhesions of different groups were evaluated by gross
observation and histological evaluation.

2.4.1 Gross
Evaluation
The surgical wounds
of mice were first examined to make sure that none of the mice was
infected. Then, the abdomen was exposed and the peritoneal adhesion
was observed, evaluated, and recorded. Representative adhesion scores
of 0–3 were analyzed and are shown in Figure 2A. Higher adhesion scores represented more
severe adhesions and increased difficulty to dissect the adhesion
bands. Figure 2B shows
the distributions of adhesion scores in different groups. The adhesion
scores of control, PFilm, PFilm+Gel, PFilm+Gel/ATV, PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel,
and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups were 2.67 ± 0.51, 1.33 ± 1.21,
1.50 ± 0.55, 0.33 ± 0.52, 0.83 ± 0.98, 0.67 ±
0.82, and 0.67 ± 1.21, respectively. In the control group, the
adhesion was extremely obvious and some adhesion bridges connected
the injured areas and adjacent organs. In comparison, the adhesion
scores in the other groups were lower. Specifically, PFilm+Gel/ATV
induced less adhesion formation compared to PFilm+Gel and PFilm (P < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences
in adhesion scores among the PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
groups. Furthermore, there were also no differences between the PFilm+Gel/ATV
and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups.

bands. (B) Distributions of adhesion scores in different groups. (C,
D) Adhesion scores (C) and adhesion areas (D) in different groups.
Data are presented as mean ± SD (n = 6; *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

The adhesion areas analyzed by Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe;
CA)
are shown in Figure 2D. The adhesion areas of control, PFilm, PFilm+Gel, PFilm+Gel/ATV,
PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups were 0.47 ± 0.13,
0.20 ± 0.19, 0.21 ± 0.11, 0.04 ± 0.06, 0.12 ±
0.14, 0.09 ± 0.12, and 0.08 ± 0.19 cm2, respectively.
All of the other groups showed less adhesion areas compared to the
control group. Mice treated with PFilm+Gel/ATV showed much alleviated
adhesion compared to PFilm+Gel and PFilm (P <
0.01). The PFilm+Gel/ATV and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups showed no statistical
difference in adhesion areas. In addition, there were also no significant
differences in adhesion areas among the PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
groups.

2.4.2 Histological Analyses
Hematoxylin
and eosin (H&E) and Masson’s trichrome staining were performed
to further analyze the adhesion formation and collagen deposition
(Figure 3A). In the
control group, there were evident adhesions between the abdomen and
cecum. Besides, large amounts of polymorphonuclear cells can be observed
in the control group, which represent severe inflammatory responses.
On the contrary, adhesions were well prevented in mice treated with
antiadhesion membranes, and only a minimal amount of collagen tissues
were
observed in these groups. However, the results of H&E staining
were consistent with those of Masson’s trichrome staining among
the PFilm, PFilm+Gel, PFilm+Gel/ATV, PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
groups.

and Masson’s trichrome staining, and immunofluorescence profiles

analyses of TNF-α (B), IL-1 (C), and IL-6 (D). Data are presented
as mean ± SD (n = 3; *P <
0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).
Scale bars = 100 μm.

2.4.3 Inflammatory Estimations
Immunofluorescence
staining of inflammatory factors, e.g., tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6), was
performed to evaluate the inflammation statuses in different groups. Figure 3A shows the confocal
laser scanning microscopy (CLSM; Carl Zeiss, LSM 780; Jena, Germany)
images of each section. CLSM images revealed that the inflammatory
factors were abundantly expressed in the injured cecum, abdomen, and
regenerated tissues in the control group. A similar phenomenon was
also found in the PFilm, PFilm+Gel, and PPFilm groups. However, in
the PFilm+Gel/ATV and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups, the expression of inflammatory
factors was extremely suppressed.

To further analyze the inflammation
responses, relative fluorescence intensities of TNF-α, IL-1,
and IL-6 in CLSM images were calculated by ImageJ software (National
Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) (Figure 3B–D). The fluorescence intensity of
the control group was defined as “1”, and the ratios
of fluorescence intensities of other groups and control group were
defined as the relative intensities. Compared to all of the other
six groups, the control group showed higher relative fluorescence
intensities of TNF-α (P < 0.05), IL-1 (P < 0.01), and IL-6 (P < 0.001).
For TNF-α, the relative fluorescence intensity in the PFilm+Gel/ATV
group was significantly lower than that in the PFilm and PFilm+Gel
groups (P < 0.001). The relative fluorescence
intensity in the PPFilm+Gel/ATV group was lower than that in the PPFilm
group (P < 0.001). For IL-1, the relative fluorescence
intensity was the lowest in the PPFilm+Gel/ATV group and there was
statistical difference between the PFilm+Gel/ATV and PPFilm+Gel/ATV
groups (P < 0.001). For IL-6, the relative fluorescence
intensities in the PFilm+Gel/ATV or PPFilm+Gel/ATV group were lower
than those in the PFilm and PPFilm groups (P <
0.001). In addition, there was significant difference in relative
fluorescence intensities between the PPFilm+Gel/ATV and PFilm+Gel/ATV
groups (P < 0.01).

3 Discussion
Postoperative abdominal adhesion is a common
complication, which
is very hard to prevent and can cause many kinds of organ dysfunctions.
Once adhesions form, the intestines or other intra-abdominal organs
may be affected, leading to functional disorders or even secondary
operation. As abdominal adhesion has attracted extensive attention,
traditional therapeutic strategies and tissue engineering technologies,
such as early exercise, physical barriers, and pharmaceutical agents,
have been well studied and applied to reduce or eliminate the peritoneal
adhesion.

As physical barriers, electrospinning membranes17,18 and hydrogels2,19 have been extensively used in
adhesion prevention to isolate the traumatized tissues from the surrounding
normal organs. Furthermore, the drug-loaded physical barriers have
been further explored in recent years, and the antiadhesion pharmaceutical
agents, such as 5-fluorouracil,20 celecoxib,5,21 mitomycin-C,22 and ATV,14,15 have been often loaded into barriers to reinforce the antiadhesion
efficiency. Among numerous drugs applied in adhesion prevention, ATV
has been reported to possess both anti-inflammation and antifibrin
deposition properties. Although the combination of physical barriers
and pharmaceutical agents has shown excellent efficacy in adhesion
prevention, the permeability of most of traditional antiadhesion devices
was less satisfactory that would probably increase the possibility
of infection and inflammatory responses and affect the wound healing.
Medical devices with better gas permeability can keep the moisture
in healing environment, exchange oxygen and water vapor well, and
decrease the chances of wound infection.23,24 As a result, applying drug-loaded physical barriers with good gas
permeability may achieve better adhesion prevention capability.

In our study, we developed a device of porous PLA film with the
ATV-loaded thermogel for peritoneal adhesion prevention. Herein, PLA
membrane mainly separated the connection of adhesion bands between
the injured sites and nearby tissues. ATV was released from the thermogel
to play anti-inflammation and antifibrin deposition effects. Besides,
the thermogel could absorb wound exudates because of its superior
swelling ratio, and also provide a relatively wet environment.25,26 The porous property of PLA film and thermogel increased the gas
permeability, thus inhibiting the possibility of infection and inflammation,
and facilitating wound healing.

WVTR was applied to detect the
gas permeability of PFilm and PPFilm
in this study. An ideal wound dressing would not only increase the
gas circulation but also control the evaporative water loss from the
wound.27 A lower WVTR can increase the
possibility of inflammatory responses, and a higher WVTR can induce
the fast drying of the wound.27 The WVTRs
of PFilm and PPFilm were all within the range of 264–4800 g
m–2 day–1, which are optimal for
injured tissues.27 However, the WVTR of
PPFilm (2101.49 ± 227.52 g m–2 day–1) was significantly higher than that of PFilm (616.86 ± 80.23
g m–2 day–1), which indicated
that PPFilm possessed better gas permeability.

The surface morphologies
of PPFilms tested by SEM showed evenly
distributed pores. No obvious differences were found in the surface
morphologies between PFilm+Gel and PPFilm+Gel, as thermogel was coated
on the surface of PFilm and PPFilm. ATV was well dissolved in the
thermogel solution in our study and no obvious drug crystals were
detected. The fine dissolution can benefit the sustained release of
ATV, a very important element for adhesion prevention. The inhomogeneous
dissolvent of agents always leads to the burst release of drugs. However,
the inhibition of peritoneal adhesion is a long process, so sustained
and long-term drug release is necessary. Therefore, full dissolution
of ATV was essential for further peritoneal adhesion prevention.

The stress–strain curves, tensile strength, Young’s
modulus, and elongation at break were all measured to evaluate the
mechanical properties of different samples. When coated on the surface
of membranes, thermogel increased the deformation-resistant ability
of the membranes. However, the pores in the membrane decreased the
deformation-resistant ability of the membranes. In addition, thermogel
increased the tensile strength, Young’s modulus, and elongation
at break of the membranes, whereas the pores in the membrane had a
negative effect on these factors.

When used for peritoneal adhesion
prevention, any movement of the
membranes may interfere in the separation effects of the fibrin bands
and result in adhesion formation. Better bioadhesion ability of the
barriers can help them stick to the injured area and avoid further
movement during the adhesion prevention process. Water contact angle
tests showed that all of the membranes were hydrophilic in this study.
Better hydrophilicity can contribute to enhanced bioadhesion ability
of the antiadhesion barriers and also avoid the use of sutures, which
may induce unnecessary inflammation and fibrin deposition. In our
previous study, we confirmed that membranes with stronger bioadhesion
ability could better inhibit inflammation responses and possessed
satisfactory adhesion prevention property.10 The excellent hydrophilicity of the samples in this study demonstrated
their satisfactory bioadhesion ability that might benefit the antiadhesion
effects.

Biodegradability is another important factor for the
antiadhesion
application of physical barriers.7 In our
study, biodegradability of different membranes was analyzed by incubation
in PBS or elastase solution for a certain period of time, and their
weight losses were calculated and recorded. The general biodegradation
rates exhibited a steep increase in elastase solution compared to
that in PBS. This is attributed to the property of elastase solution
that is inclined to degrade polymer matrices rapidly. After incubation
for 30 days, the weight losses of the samples in PBS (about 20%) were
much lower than those in elastase solution (more than 50%). Interestingly,
coating of thermogel on the membrane surfaces did not obviously change
their biodegradation process. The thermogel-coated membranes showed
similar biodegradation properties to non-thermogel-coated ones in
both incubation media. This might be explained by the similar degradation
profiles of PLA membranes to the thermogel in this study. PPFilm degraded
more quickly than PFilm in PBS and elastase solution. This might result
from the structural characterizations of PPFilm that the evenly distributed
pores increased the contact area between PPFilm and the incubation
media, thus accelerating the degradation process. Many factors (e.g.,
polymers, pore sizes, porosity, thickness of membranes) can influence
the degradation rate of polymer barriers.28,29 Unlike other PLA-based electrospun membranes, we did not observe
obvious pores composed of interwined fibers, even when the PLA membrane
was magnified 1000 times. This basic structure of PLA film may decrease
the degradation rate in our study. However, there was still about
50% weight loss of PLA film after degradation for 30 days in elastase
solution. We hypothesize that the complete degradation time of the
PLA membrane might be less than 60 days because the degraded PLA film
can be infiltrated with incubation medium and the degradation process
can be accelerated.28

Sustained drug
release from the thermogel is an essential requirement
for efficient adhesion prevention. Therefore, the drug release behavior
of ATV was also analyzed in PBS and elastase solution. As expected,
elastase accelerated the drug release, which was consistent with the
degradation properties, and demonstrated the correlation between degradation
and release profiles. Similar to the release behaviors of agents incorporated
in adhesion prevention barriers in other studies, the release of ATV
was characterized by either of the two patterns, the burst release
or sustained release.30,31 In elastase solution, the burst
release of ATV was not obvious and only about 35% amount of ATV was
released for the first 6 days. This was because of the good dissolution
of ATV in the thermogel. Sustained release of ATV was followed for
the next few days, and more than 60% of ATV was released 14 days post
surgery. In the peritoneal adhesion prevention process, long-term
drug treatment is necessary to inhibit the inflammatory responses
and predictively contribute to prevent peritoneal adhesion.1

The antiadhesion capabilities of various
membranes in vivo were
evaluated in a cecum-abdominal animal model. Compared to the control
group, the adhesion scores and adhesion areas were lower in all experimental
groups. This was because peritoneal adhesions were inhibited by physical
isolation and/or pharmaceutical treatment. Because of the combination
of physical barrier effect of the membrane, and anti-inflammation
and antifibrin deposition effects of ATV, the adhesion scores and
areas decreased more obviously in the PFilm+Gel/ATV group than those
in the PFilm and PFilm+Gel groups. However, there were no statistical
differences in adhesion formation among the PFilm+Gel/ATV, PPFilm,
PPFilm+Gel, and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups. All of the PPFilm, PPFilm+Gel,
and PPFilm+Gel/ATV groups showed excellent antiadhesion efficacy.
This might be explained by that the porous PLA film exhibited excellent
adhesion prevention effect, in which the membrane acted as the physical
isolation and the oval pores increased the gas permeability and provided
a suitable environment for wound healing.32 Through increasing the gas circulation in the injured area, the
accumulation of exudates can be decreased, the proliferation of anaerobic
bacteria can be inhibited, and the inflammation responses can be well
prevented.32 As a result, PPFilm dramatically
decreased the peritoneal adhesion, whereas the use of ATV-loaded thermogel
did not increase the adhesion prevention ability of PPFilm in our
study.

Consistent with the results of gross pathology, H&E
and Masson’s
trichrome staining experiments did not reveal any superiority of PPFilm+Gel/ATV
in adhesion prevention compared to PPFilm. We further evaluate the
inflammation inhibition effects of the samples used in our study as
an important factor for antiadhesion applications. TNF-α, IL-1,
and IL-6 are the three most important proinflammatory cytokines participating
in the immune process. TNF-α can trigger the release of IL-1
and IL-6. These three factors can increase the permeability of blood
vessels, and the production of oxygen radicals and other proinflammatory
factors.33 The secretions of these three
factors were evaluated by CLSM and semiquantitative analyses (Figure 3). For IL-1 and IL-6,
the relative fluorescence intensity of PPFilm+Gel/ATV was lower than
that of PFilm+Gel/ATV. This might attribute to the fact that the pores
increased the gas permeability, decreased the accumulation of exudates,
and further inhibited the inflammatory responses. The best anti-inflammatory
effect was observed in the PPFilm+Gel/ATV group. The expressions of
these three factors were obviously suppressed compared to other groups.
However, decreased inflammatory responses did not lead to increased
adhesion prevention effect. Just as discussed above, PPFilm exhibited
high antiadhesion ability, and the decreased inflammatory responses
did not increase the peritoneal adhesion prevention efficacy.

4 Conclusions
In this study, an antiadhesion device composed
of porous PLA film
with ATV-loaded thermogel was successfully prepared. This medical
device integrated the physical isolation and pharmaceutical treatment
and possessed high gas permeability property for effective antiadhesion.
PLA film inhibited the connection of adhesion bands between injured
areas and adjacent normal organs. ATV was released sustainably to
play antifibrin deposition and anti-inflammatory effects. The porous
property of PPFilm+Gel/ATV further inhibited the inflammatory responses
and prevented the formation of peritoneal adhesion. PPFilm+Gel/ATV
showed high anti-inflammation ability and antiadhesion effect. All
of the results demonstrated the superiority of PPFilm+Gel/ATV in the
application of peritoneal adhesion prevention.

of distilled water was then incubated in a constant temperature and
humidity chamber (37 °C and 50% RH). WVTR was calculated as WVTR
= (Δm)/(At), where Δm, A, and t are the weight
change of each cup, contact area, and incubation time, respectively.
