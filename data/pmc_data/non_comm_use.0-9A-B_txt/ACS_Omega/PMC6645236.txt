Nanocomposites of ZnO and some selected
polymers, namely, poly(ethylene
glycol), poly(vinylpyrrolidone), and polyacrylonitrile, were synthesized
and characterized using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) spectroscopy, thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.
The FTIR and UV–vis spectra confirmed the successful formation
of the polymer nanocomposites. TGA results revealed that the synthesized
polymer nanocomposites are more thermally stable than the polymers
alone. ZnO nanoparticles were about 50–75 nm in size, assumed
a rodlike shape, and got embedded in the polymer matrices, as revealed
by TEM images. Corrosion inhibition potentials of the synthesized
ZnO/polymer nanocomposites were investigated for mild steel in 5%
HCl solution using potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), linear polarization
resistance, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements.
The results showed that each ZnO/polymer nanocomposite inhibits mild
steel corrosion in 5% HCl solution better than the respective polymer
alone. The nanocomposites, according to PDP studies, behaved as a
mixed-type inhibitor. The predominant mode of adsorption of the nanocomposites
to a mild steel surface was found to be mixed type, and the adsorption
process obeys the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. Scanning electron
microscopy images also revealed the protective attributes of the ZnO/polymer
nanocomposites for mild steel in 5% HCl solution.

1 Introduction
Metals constitute a great part of materials in construction, medical,
oil and gas, petrochemical, and allied industries. In these industries,
the metallic material as a result of interaction with its surrounding
environment loses its essential properties over a period of time.
As a result, the material cannot perform the intended function effectively
and reliably.1,2 Corrosion of metals has numerous
adverse consequences and has been long known to be a matter of serious
concern to experts in both academia and industries.3

The use of inhibitor as a cost-effective and easiest
method of
repressing metal corrosion is a common fact. Organic compounds top
the chart of metal corrosion inhibitors at present.4 Nevertheless, some of these organic compounds are considered
unfriendly to the ecosystem and expensive.5 Polymers have been identified as potential ecofriendly and affordable
corrosion inhibitors.6,7 However, their limited solubility
in common aqueous corrosive media and desorption at high temperatures
have impeded their wide application as corrosion inhibitors. Metal
nanoparticles/polymer composites have proffered improvements over
the earlier known limitations of polymers as corrosion inhibitors.
Hefni et al.8 reported that chitosan-grafted-poly(ethylene
glycol) (Ch-g-mPEG) self-assembled on silver nanoparticles
exhibited superior corrosion inhibiting ability (ca. 93%) for carbon
steel in 1 M HCl solution compared to that of Ch-g-mPEG without silver nanoparticles (ca. 77%). The incorporation of
silver nanoparticles into the matrix of poly(propylene glycol),9,10 poly(methacrylic acid),11,12 chitosan,13,14 and carboxymethyl cellulose15 had also
been reported to enhance corrosion protection properties of the polymers.

Metal oxide nanoparticles are of special interest due to their
diverse mechanical, structural, thermal, electronic, magnetic, and
optical properties. Among the wide variety of metal oxide nanoparticles,
ZnO is one of the most promising because of its unique properties
such as thermal and mechanical stability at room temperature, good
physical and chemical stability, environmental friendliness, abundant
availability, and low cost. There are reports on the utilization of
polypyrrole/ZnO,16 poly(o-phenylenediamine-co-aniline)/ZnO,17 and polyaniline/ZnO18 as anticorrosion
additives in different corrosive environments. ZnO nanoparticles have
also been found to improve the thermal behavior of polymers.19,20

To the best of our knowledge, corrosion inhibition potentials
of
nanocomposites of ZnO nanoparticles with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG),
poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) have not
been reported for mild steel in 5% HCl medium. This article therefore
presents ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN nanocomposites as ecofriendly
inhibitors of mild steel corrosion in 5% HCl solution. The synthesized
ZnO/polymer nanocomposites were characterized using Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis)
spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) techniques. Electrochemical methods such as potentiodynamic
polarization (PDP), linear polarization resistance (LPR), and electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy (EIS) techniques were used for corrosion rate
measurements. Structural and molecular formulas as well as molecular
weights of PEG, PVP, and PAN are given in Table 1.

Table 1 Basic Information
of Selected Polymers
2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Mild
Steel Composition and Surface Pretreatment
The elemental
compositions (in percentage by weight) of the mild
steel used for corrosion studies are Fe (99.10), C (0.17), Mn (0.46),
Si (0.26), S (0.017), and P (0.019). Encapsulation of the mild steel
specimens in a Teflon holder with the aid of epoxy resin was done
after cutting into 1 cm × 1 cm dimension, and the exposed surface
area was 1 cm2. Struers MD Piano 220 fixed on a Struers
LaboPol-1 machine was used for the mechanical abrasion of the metal
coupons to get rid of remnants of epoxy resin and rust on the surface
of the mild steel. Then, the polishing of the mild steel specimens
was done to near mirror image with emery papers of different grit
sizes. Thereafter, the surface was washed under running water and
degreased in acetone. All electrochemical experiments were conducted
using mild steel coupons with
a freshly pretreated surface.

2.2 Chemicals
Hydrochloric acid (32%)
was commercially obtained from Promark Chemicals, South Africa, and
diluted with distilled water to prepare 5% HCl solution, used as corrosion
medium. Zn(NO3)2·6H2O and the
polymers (PEG, PVP, and PAN) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemicals.
Sodium hydroxide was purchased from Merck Chemicals.

2.3 Synthesis
2.3.1 Synthesis of ZnO Nanoparticles
Zinc nitrate, Zn(NO3)2·6H2O,
was used as a precursor in preparing zinc oxide nanoparticles using
chemical methods. NaOH pellets were dissolved in double-distilled
water to prepare a 1.0 M concentration of the solution. The alkaline
solution was heated up to 70 °C while being constantly stirred.
After attaining 70 °C, 0.5 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was dripped for 1 h into the NaOH reaction flask while still
stirring continuously. The system was kept at a steady temperature
of 70 °C throughout the experiment. The resulting suspension
formed from the slow addition of 0.5 M Zn(NO3)2·6H2O into the NaOH solution was allowed to stand
at 70 °C for 2 h. Thereafter, the suspension was filtered, severally
washed with double-distilled water, and then oven-dried at 65 °C
for several hours.21

2.3.2 Synthesis of ZnO/Polymer Nanocomposites
ZnO/polymer
(PEG, PVP, and PAN) nanocomposites were prepared by
mixing aqueous solution of the respective polymer with the synthesized
ZnO nanoparticles. First, different concentrations (100, 300, 500,
700, and 1000 ppm) of the respective polymers were prepared in 5%
HCl solution. Then, respective concentrations of the polymer solution
were used to prepare 1 mM ZnO nanoparticle solution. In the case of
relatively insoluble PAN, it was initially dissolved in small quantity
of dimethylformamide before mixing with ZnO nanoparticles.

2.4 Characterization
2.4.1 FTIR
Analysis
Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) spectra of ZnO nanoparticles, PEG, PVP, PAN, and their
respective ZnO/polymer nanocomposites were recorded using a Fourier
transform infrared spectrophotometer (Agilent Technology, Cary 670
series FTIR spectrometer). The FTIR spectrum ranged from 4000 to 500
cm–1.

2.4.2 UV–Visible Measurements
UV–visible spectra analyses of the ZnO nanoparticles, PEG,
PVP, PAN, and their respective ZnO/polymer nanocomposites were carried
out using a UV–vis spectrophotometer (Agilent Technology, Cary
300 series UV–vis spectrometer) from 250 to 700 nm. Dual beam
measurement mode was used at 1 nm resolution and 200 nm/min scan rate
at 25 °C.

2.4.3 TEM Analysis
Transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) measurements were used to determine the morphology
and size of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO/polymer nanocomposites.
A coat of ZnO nanoparticles and the ZnO/polymer nanocomposite sample
on the copper grid was dried for 1 h. The TEM micrograph images were
thereafter obtained and recorded using a JEOL JEM-2100F transmission
electron microscope, Tokyo (Japan), operated at 200 kV.

2.4.4 TGA Analysis
Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was carried out on the ZnO nanoparticles, PEG, PVP,
PAN, and their respective ZnO/polymer nanocomposites using an STA
1500 instrument. The TGA was conducted from 25 to 700 °C at a
heating rate of 10 °C min–1 under nitrogen
gas.

2.5 Electrochemical Corrosion
Studies
Electrochemical corrosion measurements were performed
on an Autolab
Potentiostat/Galvanostat 302 N instrument. The electrochemical system
uses Ag/AgCl, 3 M KCl as the reference electrode and platinum rod
as the counter electrode. A mild steel coupon serves as the working
electrode. Before each measurement, the mild steel coupon was held
in the corrosive medium for 30 min to attain a steady open circuit
potential (OCP). Electrochemical measurements were performed after
the attainment of a steady OCP. The impedance studies were conducted
at the OCP by varying the frequency between 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz, and
the impedance spectra were recorded at 10 mV amplitude. All electrochemical
measurements were performed under aerated stagnant conditions at 303
K. The data generated was analyzed using Nova 1.10.1.9 software. From
the value of the charge transfer parameter (Rct) derived from the analysis, the percentage inhibition efficiency
(η) of the inhibitor was calculated using eq 1 1  where Rct and Rct0 are the charge transfer resistances in the presence and absence
of inhibitors, respectively.

For potentiodynamic polarization
studies, measurements were carried out at a constant scan rate of
1 mV/s by sweeping the potential in the range ±250 mV with respect
to the OCP. By extrapolating the linear sections of the polarization
curves, numerical values of the anodic Tafel slope (βa), cathodic Tafel slope (βc), corrosion potential
(Ecorr), and corrosion current density
(icorr) were obtained. The percentage
inhibition efficiency, η, was calculated following eq 2 2  where icorri and icorr0 are the corrosion
current densities with and without the inhibitors, respectively.

For polarization resistance measurements, experiments were performed
with a potential in the range ±250 mV relative to OCP and the
current response was studied at a scan rate of 0.125 mV/s. For the
purpose of obtaining linear polarization resistance (LPR) graphs,
the over-potential and current values were drawn on a linear scale.
The slope of the graphs in the vicinity of the corrosion potential
gave the polarization resistance (Rp).
The percentage inhibition efficiency from this technique was computed
thus 3  where Rp and Rp0 are the
polarization resistance values with and without the inhibitors,
respectively.

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM) Analysis
The surface morphologies of the mild steel
specimens after immersion
in 5% HCl without and with 1000 ppm of PEG, PVP, PAN, and their respective
ZnO nanocomposites for 24 h were examined and recorded using a SEM
JEOL JSM-6610 LV instrument.

3 Results
and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of ZnO
Nanoparticles and
ZnO/Polymer Nanocomposite Formation
3.1.1 FTIR
Studies
Figure 1 represents the FTIR spectra of PEG, PVP,
PAN, ZnO nanoparticles, and the nanocomposites of the respective polymers
recorded at room temperature from 4000 to 500 cm–1. In the ZnO nanoparticle spectrum, the absorption band at 531 cm–1 is typical of the Zn–O stretching vibration.22 The presence of this distinct sharp peak in
the ZnO spectrum confirms the formation of ZnO nanocrystals.23 The FTIR spectra of PEG and ZnO/PEG nanocomposite
in Figure 1a display
similar bands. The sharp absorption peak at 2883 cm–1 is due to the C–H stretching band and the peak noticed at
1346 cm–1 corresponds to the C–O–H
bending vibration. The observed peak at 842 cm–1 corresponds to the long polymeric chain bending in the polymer,
and the peak at 1108 cm–1 is attributed to the C–O
stretching vibration. However, by juxtaposing the spectrum of PEG
to that of ZnO/PEG, it is noticed that the absorption bands at 2883
and 1346 cm–1 are prominent in the ZnO/PEG spectrum.
Again, it is observed that the Zn–O stretching mode at 542
cm–1 in the ZnO spectrum is present in the ZnO/PEG
nanocomposite spectrum. This suggests modification of PEG properties
occasioned by the inclusion of ZnO nanoparticles. The broadness of
the O–H stretching vibration peak at 3600 cm–1 and the appearance of the Zn–O vibration mode at 544 cm–1 in the ZnO/PVP spectrum relative to the PVP spectrum
in Figure 1b may mean
successful formation of ZnO/PVP. In Figure 1c, the Zn–O stretching band appears
at 547 cm–1, also pointing to the formation of the
ZnO/PAN nanocomposite.

and ZnO/PVP,
and (c) PAN, ZnO, and ZnO/PAN.

3.1.2 UV–Vis Studies
The UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy is a novel technique for the characterization
of ZnO nanoparticles. The UV–vis spectrum of ZnO gives a characteristic
peak at about 360–380 nm.24−26Figure 2 shows the UV–vis absorption spectra
for ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN nanocomposites, respectively. As
could be seen in the figure, the ZnO characteristic peak is at 368,
367, and 372 nm in the ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN spectra, respectively,
confirming the formation of the nanocomposites. The absorption band
at about 265–274 nm in the nanocomposite spectra is worth mentioning,
which is caused by the π absorption of the functional groups
in the polymers.27

and (c) PAN and ZnO/PAN. Inset (a): ZnO nanoparticles.

3.1.3 TGA Studies
Thermogravimetric analysis
is a reliable tool in determining the thermal behavior of substances,
thermal degradation and weight loss, as it varies with temperature.28 The TGA profiles of the synthesized ZnO nanoparticles,
polymers, and polymer nanocomposites are shown in Figure 3. The TGA profile of ZnO nanoparticles
reveals a total weight loss of 6.10% at about 492 °C, attributed
to the removal of moisture content. No decomposition essentially occurs
after this up to 700 °C, which is in perfect agreement with the
report of Shamsuzzaman et al.25 In Figure 3a, the TGA profile
of ZnO/PEG shows an initial weight loss of 4.19% at about 212 °C,
which is attributed to the elimination of water and volatile solvents.
This is accompanied by a rapid weight loss of 73.16% at 530 °C.
PEG was almost completely thermally decomposed at about 420 °C.
At 650 °C, the residue of ZnO/PEG is about 23%, whereas that
of PEG is less than 1.00%. This confirms that the presence of ZnO
nanoparticles in the polymer nanocomposite improves its thermal stability.29

Figure 3 TGA curves of (a) PEG, ZnO, and ZnO/PEG, (b) PVP, ZnO,
and ZnO/PVP,
and (c) PAN, ZnO, and ZnO/PAN.

ZnO/PVP demonstrates three stages of weight loss, as seen
in Figure 3b. At the
first stage,
there is 8.13% weight loss from 25 to 308 °C, which is attributed
to the removal of residual solvent present in the nanocomposite. The
second stage has a weight loss of 76.80%, which started at 308 °C
and ended at about 502 °C due to the decomposition of PVP chains.
Finally, an insignificant loss of about 1.00% occurred at 641 °C,
and it is expected that the only change at this stage is in the crystal
structure. It is observed that PVP is completely decomposed at 641
°C leaving only the carbon residue. From the thermal behavior
of PVP observed in the curve, it is seen that an initial weight loss
of 4.71% occurred at 270 °C, followed by a significant weight
loss of 90.38% between 270 and 464 °C, which represents the decomposition
of the polymer. The ZnO/PVP nanocomposite is more thermally stable
compared with PVP, and this can be attributed to the higher chain
compactness due to the interaction between the PVP and ZnO nanoparticles.30

For PAN shown in Figure 3c, 1.40% weight loss is observed at 268 °C
due to the
loss of moisture, low molecular weight oligopolymers, and dehydrogenation.
This is followed by a rapid weight loss of 32.00% within the temperature
range of 267 and 350 °C. In the last stage, 23.08% weight loss
occurs at about 485 °C, leading to reduction in the weight of
PAN. The ZnO/PAN nanocomposite has weight losses of 2.24% at 267 °C
at the first stage, 21.81% at 324 °C at the second stage, and
18.17% at 485 °C at the third stage. It is observed that whereas
the total weight loss of 56.48% is recorded for PAN at about 485 °C,
the nanocomposite containing ZnO nanoparticles has a weight reduction
of 42.22% at the same temperature and a higher residue. These results
again agree with the aforementioned that the presence of the ZnO nanoparticles
in the polymer backbone reduces weight loss and promotes the formation
of a thermally stable structure due to ionic and molecular cross-linking.31,32 The observed improvement in the thermal stability of the polymers
upon embedment of ZnO nanoparticles suggests that ZnO/polymer nanocomposites
promise to perform better and last longer than the ordinary polymer
when used for high-temperature industrial processes where corrosion
needs to be inhibited.

3.1.4 TEM Studies
The surface morphologies
of the ZnO nanoparticles and polymer nanocomposites observed using
TEM are shown in Figure 4. The TEM image of the ZnO nanoparticles as presented in Figure 4a reveals that the
ZnO nanoparticles are crystalline and rodlike. Matinise et al.24 had recently reported that ZnO nanoparticles
synthesized using Moringa oleifera extract
as the chelating agent appear rodlike. The sizes of the synthesized
ZnO nanoparticles are in the range of 50–75 nm. The presence
of aggregated ZnO nanoparticles is evident from the TEM image. It
is obvious from Figure 4b–d that the ZnO nanoparticles are embedded inside the matrix
of the respective polymer. The images again confirm the successful
synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles and ZnO/polymer nanocomposites.

and (d) ZnO/PAN nanocomposites.

3.2 Electrochemical Corrosion Assessments
3.2.1 OCP–Time Profile, PDP, and LPR Studies
OCP–time
profiles for mild steel in 5% HCl in the presence
of various concentrations of the polymer/ZnO nanocomposites are shown
in Figure 5. The profiles
revealed that the systems attained a stable OCP before the first 600
s after immersion in the corrosive media. Therefore, the adopted 30
min waiting period before electrochemical disturbance can be adjudged
sufficient for OCP stabilization. More so, there is a marked difference
between the equilibrium OCP values of the blank and inhibited systems.
This suggests that the polymer/ZnO nanocomposites have some influence
on the electrochemical (corrosion) process occurring in the aggressive
solution. The OCP values in the presence of PEG/ZnO (at various concentrations)
are generally more anodic than those of the blank, indicating that
the steel is nobler in the presence of PEG/ZnO compared with 5% HCl
(with the additive). Similar observations were recorded in the presence
of PVP/ZnO. On the other hand, the OCP values in the presence of PAN/ZnO
are more cathodic than those of the blank. These observations suggest
that PEG/ZnO and PVP/ZnO might have more influence on anodic mild
steel oxidation in 5% HCl than on the accompanying cathodic reduction
reaction, whereas PAN/ZnO might preferentially affect the cathodic
reaction more than the anodic half-reaction.

Figure 5 Variation of OCP with
time for mild steel in 5% HCl without and
with different concentrations of polymer/ZnO nanocomposites.

The polarization curves derived
from potentiodynamic polarization
experiments on the working electrode in 5% HCl devoid of and containing
various concentrations of ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN respectively
at 303 K are presented in Figure 6. The associated polarization parameters are presented
in Table 2. The figure
reveals that the introduction of the studied inhibitors into the acidic
medium reduced current densities at the anodic and cathodic sites.
The inhibitors slightly shifted the corrosion potential to a noble
position except ZnO/PAN that displaced the corrosion potential cathodically.
This observation suggests that although the nanocomposites exhibit
mixed-type tendency the ZnO/PEG and ZnO/PVP retard the dissolution
of the mild steel at the anode better than the reduction of hydrogen
ion at the cathode, whereas ZnO/PAN principally affects the cathodic
reactions.9 The addition of polymers and
ZnO/polymer nanocomposites to the corrosive medium caused a decrease
in icorr value compared to the value for
the blank system, as seen in Table 2. This result is seen to be determined by the quantity
of the studied inhibitor used, and the direct effect is an increment
in the inhibition performance of the nanocomposite. At 1000 ppm, ZnO/PAN
affords 83.42% protection efficiency, whereas the same concentration
for ZnO/PVP and ZnO/PEG offers 74.50 and 69.43%, respectively. The
values of both βa and βc for inhibitor-containing
systems were compared to those of the blank, and only a little change
was observed. This suggests that ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN adsorb
on the metal surface in 5% HCl solution by the geometric blocking
mechanism.9

plots for mild steel in 5% HCl in
the absence and presence of different concentrations of (a) ZnO/PEG,
(b) ZnO/PVP, and (c) ZnO/PAN.

The values of Rp and the calculated
ηLPR obtained from LPR measurements are also listed
in Table 2. The results
show that the Rp values for various concentrations
of the studied inhibitors are greater than those of the blank solution.
This again reflects the effectiveness of the polymer nanocomposites
in boosting the corrosion resistance of the studied metal in 5% HCl
solution. There is good agreement between the ηLPR and ηPDP values.

3.2.2 EIS
Studies
The impedance of an
electrochemical system over a frequency range can be measured using
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The frequency response
of a mild steel working electrode in relation to electrochemical reactions
occurring at the electrode/electrolyte interface can be described
by EIS measurements. Nyquist, Bode phase angle, and Bode modulus diagrams
can be used to represent electrochemical impedance spectra. However,
some scholars have recommended Bode modulus as the easiest and most
appropriate of the three popular impedance diagrams because the dispersion
of the experimental data is minimized and it gives a better insight
into the frequency-dependent response of the system. However, many
authors choose to exploit the three representations in their studies,33,34 as each plot provides some unique information about the interfacial
phenomena that take place in the system. The EIS spectra for mild
steel in 5% HCl for the blank and inhibitor-containing media at 303
K are presented in Figure 7. The impedance diagrams in Figure 7a–c contain depressed and imperfect
semicircles, which are the characteristic features of solid working
electrodes, indicating frequency dispersions of interfacial impedance.35 This feature is ascribed to fracture structures,
distribution of activity centers, coarseness of the working electrode
surface, adsorption of inhibitors, and formation of porous layers.13,36 The single depressed semicircles in the Nyquist plots are analogous
to a single time constant in the Bode diagrams in Figure 7d–f. This suggests that
the corrosion of the mild steel is mainly dominated by a single charge
transfer process.13,14,36 A comparison of the impedance spectra recorded in the corrosive
solution devoid of inhibitor to those recorded in acid solution enriched
with inhibitor reveals some similarity in the profiles. This indicates
that the studied inhibitors did not alter the corrosion mechanism
of the metal specimen in the corrosive environment.37,38 However, the impedance spectra of the inhibited systems are larger
in size than those of the uninhibited system. The Bode diagrams exhibited
increased area under the phase angle curves with the addition of the
studied inhibitors compared to that for the uninhibited solution.39 The observed increment is clearly a function
of inhibitor concentration, which suggests that more inhibitor molecules
adsorb on the mild steel surface and a protective film is formed.
An increase in the amount of the inhibitor may have led to a greater
surface coverage. This is also obvious in the Bode modulus (Figure 7d–f) and phase
angle (Figure 7g–i)
plots, i.e., an increase in the concentration of nanocomposites increases
the impedance modulus at low frequencies as well as the phase angles.

Figure 7 Nyquist
(a–c), Bode (d–f), and phase angle (g–i)
plots for mild steel in 5% HCl without and with different concentrations
of ZnO/polymer nanocomposites

Figure 8 presents
the electrical equivalent circuit used for analyzing the impedance
spectra. Simulation results for ZnO/polymer nanocomposites show that
this electrical equivalent circuit accurately fits to the experimental
data (Figure 9 and Table 3). Randle’s
equivalent circuit comprises a resistor of solution resistance (Rs) and a resistor of charge transfer resistance
(Rct), which are in parallel connection
with the constant phase element (CPE). CPE was introduced in the equivalent
circuit instead of a pure double-layer capacitor (Cdl) to get a more accurate fit. However, the Cdl values were computed from the Y0 and n values, which are the magnitudes of
CPE and deviation parameter (−1 ≤ n ≤ 1, which is dependent on surface morphology) using eq 4.40,41 The inhibition efficiency was computed using eq 1. The estimated electrochemical parameters
are listed in Table 3. 4  The results (in Table 3) show that Rct values
in the presence of inhibitors are greater than those of uninhibited
medium and increase with an increase in inhibitor concentration. As
the Rct value increases, the inhibition
efficiency increases. Again, this emphasizes the dependency of inhibition
performance on the concentration of the inhibitor. The n values are close to unity, suggesting the pseudocapacitive characteristics
of the electrode/electrolyte interface.42,43 It is also
clear from the table that the Cdl value
declines steadily with an increasing amount of inhibitor. This decline
in the value of Cdl can be interpreted
using the Helmholtz equation 5  where ε represents
the dielectric constant
of the protective layer, εo represents the permittivity
of free space, and d is the thickness of the double
layer. This implies that an increase in d or a decrease
in ε can cause a decrease in the value of Cdl. Therefore, the decrease in Cdl value with an increasing inhibitor concentration in the
present investigation is due to greater surface coverage as the inhibitor
concentration was increased, which agrees with the behavior of η
with increasing inhibitor concentration.

A quick comparison of the inhibition efficiency
of ZnO/polymers
of the present work with those reported in the literature (Table 4) reveals that although
the inhibition efficiency is not the same, it compares well. Factors
such as differences in the concentration of the corrosive medium,
chemical composition of the polymer, and the concentration of ZnO/polymer
used might be responsible for the observed variation in inhibition
efficiency. It could be concluded from Table 4 that the ZnO/polymer nanocomposite is effective
in inhibiting steel corrosion in HCl environment. Umoren and Solomon44 had classified corrosion inhibitors with percentage
inhibition efficiency greater than 70% as excellent inhibitors.

3.3 Effect
of ZnO Nanoparticles on the Inhibition
Efficiency of the Polymers
To examine the effect of the ZnO
nanoparticles on the inhibitive ability of the polymers in the acid
solution, EIS experiments were undertaken with 1000 ppm polymers and
their respective ZnO/polymer nanocomposites. The comparative Nyquist
plots are shown in Figure 10. As could be seen in the figure, the diameter of the respective
nanocomposite capacitive loop is bigger than that of the corresponding
polymer. This clearly shows an improved inhibition performance of
the studied polymers, which can be attributed to the presence of ZnO
nanoparticles. It is noticed from Table 3 that the presence of ZnO nanoparticles raised
the Rct value for PEG, PVP, and PAN from
56.1, 142.0, and 85.4 Ω cm2, respectively, to 58.0,
185.0, and 93.0 Ω cm2. The inhibition efficiency
is stepped up from 69.70, 88.03, and 80.09% for PEG, PVP, and PAN,
respectively, to 70.69, 90.81, and 81.72% for the respective ZnO/polymer
nanocomposites. This seems to suggest that the ZnO nanoparticles induce
the participation of more of the polymer active sites in the adsorption
process or they interact directly with the metal surface. According
to Solomon et al.,14,15 metal nanoparticles have the
tendency to directly chemisorb on a mild steel surface.

of 1000 ppm of (a) PEG and ZnO/PEG, (b) PVP and ZnO/PVP, and (c) PAN
and ZnO/PAN.

3.4 Adsorption
Consideration
An adsorption
isotherm model was deployed to ascertain the mode of adsorption of
the studied ZnO/polymer nanocomposites onto a mild steel surface in
5% HCl medium. The experimental data were tested with diverse isotherm
models, including Freundlich, Temkin, El-Awady et al., and Langmuir
adsorption isotherm. By virtue of the linear regression values (R2) in Figure 11, the best line of fit for the adsorption process was
obtained with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm model. The Langmuir
isotherm model is expressed as45 6  where θ
represents the surface coverage, Kads represents
the adsorption equilibrium constant,
and Cinh represents the concentration
of the inhibitors. The graphs of Cinh/θ
against Cinh for the studied systems are
presented in Figure 11. Obviously, the graphs are all linear and the R2 values are near unity, suggesting that the adsorption
of ZnO/polymer nanocomposites onto the steel surface in 5% HCl solution
is best described by this model. However, a close look at the figure
reveals that the slope deviated slightly from unity, required by the
ideal Langmuir isotherm model. This is not surprising as the possibility
of large organic molecules attaching to more than one adsorption site
on a metal surface has been reported in the literature.46−49 The Langmuir adsorption model had erroneously assumed a monolayer
adsorption of organic molecules on a metal surface. From the intercepts
of the graphs in Figure 11, the value of Kads is computed
and listed in Table 5. Using the Kads value, Gibb’s
Free energy (ΔG°ads) of the
adsorption process also given in Table 5 was calculated thus50 7  where 1
× 106 represents the
concentration of water in the solution expressed in ppm, T represents the absolute temperature, and R is the
universal gas constant. The Kads and ΔG°ads values (Table 5) fall into the range of values interpreted
in the literature12,15 for mixed adsorption, i.e., physisorption
and chemisorption. The negative sign of the ΔG°ads value signifies that the ZnO/polymer nanocomposites
adsorb on the metal surface spontaneously and guarantees the stability
of the adsorbed layer.

various concentrations of ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN, respectively,

3.5 Mechanism
of Inhibition
The adsorption
of organic inhibitors on the metal surface is accepted to be a substitution
adsorption process because water molecules adsorbed on the metal surface
are replaced by organic inhibitor molecules.51 As noted from the experimental results in Tables 2 and 3, the increase
in the quantity of the inhibitor improved the corrosion inhibition
of the mild steel specimens in 5% HCl. This indicates that more molecules
of the studied ZnO/polymer nanocomposites were adsorbed on the surface
of the mild steel at higher concentrations, resulting in greater surface
coverage.

The order of inhibition performance achieved by the
studied ZnO/polymer nanocomposites for mild steel corrosion in 5%
HCl at the maximum concentration of 1000 ppm from the EIS result is
as follows: ZnO/PVP > ZnO/PAN > ZnO/PEG. The adsorption of the
inhibitor
molecules would take place through the heteroatoms such as O and N
as well as π-bonds.52−54 The inhibition efficiency is
expected to increase in the order N > O.55 Other factors such as molecular weight, solubility, and structure
of the inhibitors would also influence adsorption cum inhibition.56,57 The molecular structures of PEG, PVP, and PAN indicate that PEG
possesses only oxygen atom, PVP possesses nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms,
and PAN contains only nitrogen atom. It has been reported that nitrogen-containing
inhibitors tend to perform optimally as corrosion inhibitors in hydrochloric
acid.58,59 Also, chelating rings present in PVP cause
an increase in the electron density on the nitrogen heteroatom. This
might inform the higher inhibition potential of PVP compared to that
of PEG and PAN. PAN acts as a more effective inhibitor of mild steel
compared with PEG due to its high molecular weight, the possession
of triple bond, and the presence of nitrogen atom. The major setback
with PAN is its relative insolubility in the corrosive medium. The
incorporation of ZnO nanoparticles into these polymers results in
the reinforcement of the properties of the polymers. ZnO nanoparticles
may also act as a physical barrier against attacking ions in the corrosive
medium.60 According to Morsi et al.,60 ZnO nanoparticles can increase their surface
area such that the ability of the nanocomposites to be adsorbed on
the metal surface increase. They can equally interact with the ions
liberated during the corrosion reaction and/or cause an increase in
the rate probability for the occurrence. Again, the ZnO nanoparticles
can enhance the metal anticorrosion effect due to their ability of
catalyzing oxygen reduction on the steel surface and thus increase
the nanocomposite ability to plug some pores and defects on the metal
surface.61

3.6 Surface
Morphological Studies
The
surface morphology of mild steel coupons immersed for 24 h in 5% HCl
in the absence and presence of 1000 ppm of the ZnO/polymer nanocomposites
was observed using scanning electron microscopy. The surface micrographs
provide information on the extent of surface damage caused by the
corrosive ions in each of the corrosive media. Figure 12a shows the micrograph image of the freshly
abraded mild steel specimen. The surface is free from cracks and pits
but only characterized by grove lines resulting from mechanical abrasion.
In Figure 12b, the
surface of the mild steel specimen can be seen to be severely damaged
with observable cracks and pits after 24 h immersion in uninhibited
corrosive solution (5% HCl).

Figure 12 SEM micrographs of the mild steel surface (a)
freshly abraded,
(b) retrieved from 5% HCl, (c) retrieved from 5% HCl + ZnO/PEG, (d)
retrieved from 5% HCl + ZnO/PVP, and (e) retrieved from 5% HCl + ZnO/PAN,
after 24 h immersion.

The surface morphologies in Figure 12c–e reveal a drastic reduction in
the surface damage occasioned by the adsorption of the nanocomposites.
The surfaces are smoother compared to the one in Figure 12b. This is in support of the
experimental results that ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN respectively
retard the corrosion of mild steel in 5% HCl solution.

4 Conclusions
Three polymers (PEG, PVP, and PAN) and
their ZnO nanocomposites
have been studied for their anticorrosion potentials for mild steel
in 5% HCl solution with the use of different characterization and
electrochemical techniques. The following conclusions can be drawn
on the basis of the results of the study:1. Nanocomposites of ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP,
and ZnO/PAN have been successfully synthesized by the chemical method
and characterized using FTIR, UV–vis, TGA, and TEM techniques.

2. TGA results showed that
ZnO/polymer
nanocomposites are more thermally stable than individual polymer molecules
(without the metal oxide).

3. The nanocomposites effectively repressed
the dissolution of mild steel in 5% HCl solution, and the anticorrosion
performance increased with an increase in the concentration of the
inhibitors.

4. Potentiodynamic
polarization studies
revealed that the inhibitors exhibit a mixed-type effect on mild steel
dissolution in 5% HCl solution.

5. The order of efficiency of inhibition
is ZnO/PVP > ZnO/PAN > ZnO/PEG.

6. ZnO/polymer nanocomposites adsorb onto
the surface of mild steel by both physisorption and chemisorption
processes, which can be explained with the Langmuir adsorption isotherm
model.

7. SEM images support
experimental results
that ZnO/PEG, ZnO/PVP, and ZnO/PAN are effective inhibitors for mild
steel in 5% HCl solution.
