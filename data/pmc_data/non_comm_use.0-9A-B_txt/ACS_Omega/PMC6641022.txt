This work aims at exploring the application of polybenzoxazines
as thermal latent curing agents for epoxy resins. Thorough studies
have shown that hydrogen bonds of polybenzoxazines block the reactivity
of phenolic hydroxyl at ambient temperatures and break at elevated
temperatures to release the free phenolic hydroxyl. On the basis of
these findings, polybenzoxazines are used as thermal latent curing
agents. Mixtures of polybenzoxazines and epoxy resins exhibit a long
shelf life at room temperature, and the corresponding copolymers possess
enhanced properties. This novel insight into using polybenzoxazines
as thermal latent curing agents for epoxy resins is anticipated to
help researchers explore novel latent curing agents and apply polybenzoxazines
more widely.

1 Introduction
As widely used thermosetting resins, epoxy resins have been applied
in many areas, for instance, as coatings and adhesives and in aerospace
and microelectronics. Generally, as epoxy resins cannot cure in the
absence of curing agents, various types of chemical compounds, for
example, anhydrides,1−3 imidazoles,4,5 thiols,6−8 primary amines,9−12 and
phenols13 have been used to cure epoxy
resins. Because curing agents greatly determine the properties of
the resins, such as processability, electrical properties, and mechanical
performance, many works focus on studying the curing agents.

Some curing agents, like imidazoles and thiols, can convert liquid
epoxy into an insoluble solid even at room temperature (RT) due to
their high reactivity. This leads to poor storage stability, and these
curing agents cannot be used as one-component mixtures with epoxy
resins.14 Other curing agents, for example,
anhydrides and phenols, can be used as one-component mixtures with
epoxy, but the curing temperature is so high that it leads to disadvantages
in application.15 Therefore, the search
for superior
curing agents is still underscored by the academic and industrial
community. Preparation of latent curing agents is regarded as an effective
approach because latent curing agents not only possess good storage
stability when used as a one-component mixture with epoxy but could
also polymerize effectively under certain stimuli, such as heat, light,
or pressure.4,16,17 An
interesting technique to prepare latent curing agents is to take advantage
of the thermal responsiveness of hydrogen bonds, that is, hydrogen
bonds
can block the reactivity of compounds at RT and break at an elevated
temperature to unblock their reactivity toward epoxy resins.17,18 As small molecules, however, most thermal latent curing agents with
hydrogen bonds may generate residues and hinder the properties of
the corresponding resins.19−21 Hence, polymers that can react with epoxy resins and act as latent
curing agents will be favored.

Polybenzoxazines, polymers with
a —CH2—NR—CH2— structure
obtained via the polymerization of corresponding benzoxazines, possess
many excellent properties (for instance, molecular design flexibility,
good mechanical strength, excellent dielectric properties, low water
absorption and near-zero volumetric shrinkage), which is attributed
to their hydrogen bonds.22−26 For
classical polybenzoxazines, hydrogen bonds are formed between the
generated phenolic hydroxyl (—OH) and hydrogen-bonding acceptors
(i.e., —OH, —N—Ar, and π).27−29 Hydrogen bonds can block the
reactivity of —OH at a low temperature and release active free
phenolic hydroxyl with increasing temperature.30 In the case of polybenzoxazine, the hydrogen bonds may
endow polybenzoxazines with thermal latency, which will be explored
in this work. More importantly, benzoxazines can react with epoxy
resins to produce copolymers, which exhibit several excellent properties
and have been applied in many areas, like electronic packing, printed
circuit boards, and mechanical technology.31−34 On the basis
of these properties, polybenzoxazines are expected to act as thermal
latent curing agents and enhance the properties of epoxy resins. Nonetheless,
to the best of our knowledge, no such studies have been reported.
Some key issues, such as whether polybenzoxazines can act as thermal
latent curing agents and the reasons for thermal latency and the curing
reaction still remain.

Hence, this work focuses on exploring
the application of polybenzoxazines as thermal latent curing agents.
As thermosets, polybenzoxazines are polymerized from benzoxazines
consisting of multiple oxazine ring groups. During polymerization,
covalent crosslinking occurs and results in cross-linked networks
that could resist heat softening and solvent attack, making polybenzoxazines
impossible to blend with epoxy resins. For application as latent curing
agents, soluble polybenzoxazines are required. Hence, in this work,
two kinds of single oxazine ring-containing benzoxazine monomers were
synthesized. One was synthesized from p-cresol and
aniline (denoted pC-a) and the other was synthesized
from p-cresol and benzylamine (denoted pC-b). Their polymers (PpC-a and PpC-b) were employed to explore their application as thermal latent
curing agents. The
results showed that polybenzoxazines exhibited good latency at RT
and can become enhanced performance copolymers after blending with
epoxy resins. This suggested that polybenzoxazines can act as good
candidates for thermal latent curing agents. Detailed analyses and
discussions are provided below.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 In Situ Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Tests of Polybenzoxazines
Phenolic hydroxyl (—OH), generated from benzoxazines, could
act as a hydrogen-bonding donor to form hydrogen bonds in polybenzoxazines
and react with epoxy resins. Hence, this work probed the variation
of phenolic hydroxyl of polybenzoxazines using in situ FTIR. We performed
the experiment from RT to 200 °C, and the spectra of PpC-a and PpC-b in the region of 3800–2000
cm–1, corresponding to the absorption of —OH,
are shown in Figures 1 and S2, respectively.

Figure 1 In situ FTIR spectra of PpC-a from RT to 200 °C.

At RT, as
can be seen
from Figure 1, absorption
by bonded —OH was observed from 3230 to 3450 cm–1 and almost no obvious absorption by free —OH was observed
at ∼3566 cm–1, suggesting that most —OH
of PpC-a formed hydrogen bonds. Because hydrogen
bonds can block the reactivity of —OH, the reactivity of PpC-a toward epoxy would be blocked by hydrogen bonds at
RT. As the temperature
increased, the intensity of the bands between 3230 and 3450 cm–1 decreased, whereas absorption at ∼3566 cm–1 increased continually. This variation suggested that
bonded —OH of PpC-a transformed into free
—OH as the temperature increased, that is, the reactivity of
—OH was unblocked with an increase in temperature. A similar
trend was also observed for PpC-b (Figure S2). As the temperature increased, absorption by bonded
—OH between 3200 and 3400 cm–1 became weaker,
whereas the absorption by free —OH at ∼3600 cm–1 increased. However, this variation was not so obvious, probably
because of the formation of hydrogen bonds (the absolute dominant
hydrogen bond of PpC-b is the —OH···N
hydrogen bond) resulting from the amine moiety.27,35 As
for PpC-a-acylated (Figure S3), no changes were observed in the spectra owing to the absensice
of —OH. These features indicated that the —OH of polybenzoxazines
might possess a thermal latent effect.

2.2 Synchronous PCMW2D Correlation of Polybenzoxazines
To further explore the thermal responsiveness of hydrogen bonds
of PpC-a and PpC-b, perturbation-correlation
moving-window two-dimensional (PCMW2D) correlation spectroscopy, a
powerful and nimble tool to study molecular structure and molecular
interaction, was applied. PCMW2D correlation spectroscopy combines
generalized two-dimensional correlation36 and moving-window two-dimensional correlation37 spectroscopy. PCMW2D correlation spectroscopy produce contour
maps of a spectral variable (abscissa) and perturbation variable (ordinate);
here, the spectral variable and perturbation variable are, respectively,
wavenumber and temperature. In this work, synchronous PCMW2D correlation,
a direct correlation between spectral variation and perturbation variation
(a linear change function), is employed.38,39

In the classical synchronous PCMW2D correlation spectra, warm-color
and cool-color contour areas represent positive and negative correlations
with
temperature change, respectively. In other words, warm color always
indicates an increase in the absorption intensity of the corresponding
groups, that is, a concentration increase. Cool-color contour areas,
by contrast, signify a corresponding decrease in concentration. In
the case of the synchronous PCMW2D correlation spectrum for PpC-a (Figure 2), three intense minimum correlation valleys corresponding to bonded
—OH, in the range of 3230–3450 cm–1, emerged at ∼30, ∼60, and ∼180 °C, and
three intense maximum correlation peaks assigned to free —OH
(∼3566 cm–1) appeared at ∼48, ∼105,
and ∼190 °C. These indicated that the bond in bonded —OH
broke and generated free —OH. Similar observations were made
in the in the synchronous PCMW2D correlation spectrum of PpC-b, as shown in Figure S4,
that is, cool- and warm-color contour areas appeared at around 140
and 110 °C, respectively. Although, these areas appeared to a
lesser extent compared to that in PpC-a, the results
still imply that the massive dissociation of bonded —OH occurred
at ∼110 °C and the generation of free —OH occurred
at ∼140 °C. This suggests that the bonded —OH of
polybenzoxazines can convert into free —OH as the temperature
increases and further supports the fact that the reactivity of —OH
would be unblocked at elevated temperatures.

2.3 Curing Reaction Behaviors
As mentioned
previously, this work attempted to use polybenzoxazines as thermal
latent curing agents. To evaluate the reactivity of polybenzoxazines
toward epoxy resins, the curing reaction behaviors of the mixtures
of E51 and PpC-a or PpC-b were studied
by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), as shown in Figure 3. As can be seen from Figure 3, obvious exothermic
peaks were observed in the curves, showing that PpC-a and PpC-b were effective curing agents for E51.
Multiple peaks, located at ∼150, ∼196, and ∼250
°C, were detected in the curve of E51/PpC-a,
whereas a single peak around 245 °C was observed in the curve
of E51/PpC-b. Interestingly, this is in accordance
with the features of the synchronous PCMW2D correlation spectrum,
further suggesting that the reactivity of the bonded —OH of
polybenzoxazines can be unblocked at elevated temperature. To better
understand the curing behavior, in this work, the conversion of epoxy
resins was calculated from the exothermic peaks to assess the consumption
rates (Figure S5).18 This showed that E51/PpC-a cured rapidly and reached
a very high conversion at ∼250 °C; however, the curing
of E51/PpC-b started at ∼180 °C. This
is probably attributed
to the difference in the temperature of unblocking the reactivity
of —OH between PpC-a and PpC-b, resulting from differences in the formation of hydrogen bonds.
The interesting results also indicated that latent curing agents with
different curing temperatures can be attained through designing and
synthesizing polybenzoxazines.

Figure 3 DSC curves of E51/PpC-a, E51/PpC-b, E51/p-cresol, E51/N,N-diethylbenzylamine
(N,N-DEBA), E51/N,N-DEBA/p-cresol, and E51/PpC-a-acylated.

To better understand the reaction
between polybenzoxazines and epoxy resins, phenols (p-cresol), N,N-DEBA, and the ploybenzoxazines
without phenol groups (PpC-a-acylated) were used
to explore the reaction, as shown in Figure 3. Phenols can be used as curing agents for
epoxy; yet, their poor reactivity leads to the requirement for a high
curing temperature, and so, no obvious exotherm was observed in the
DSC curve of E51/p-cresol. Tertiary amines can be
used as cure accelerators but not as curing agents; therefore, no
distinct exotherm was detected in the mixtures of E51 and N,N-DEBA, either. However, when the curing
agents and accelerator coexisted, an exothermic peak appeared in the
curve of E51/p-cresol/N,N-DEBA, with the starting exothermic temperature, ∼50
°C, being much lower than that for E51/PpC-a
and E51/PpC-b, which further demonstrated that the
formation of hydrogen bonds effectively blocked the reactivity of
phenolic hydroxyl at a low temperature. As for PpC-a-acylated, in the absence of phenol groups, tertiary amine groups
alone cannot cure E51, just like that for N,N-DEBA. These results suggest that the high reactivity between
polybenzoxazines and epoxy resins was not due to —OH or —CH2—NR—CH2— solely but synergistically.
All of these characteristics show that the interesting chemical structures
and hydrogen bonds of polybenzoxazines not only made for good thermal
latency but also produced high reactivity toward epoxy resins at elevated
temperatures.

2.4 Evaluation
of Storage Stability
Storage stability, depending on the
reactivity of curing agents, plays an important role in processability;
hence, this work probed storage stability by detecting the viscosity
variation at RT (Figure 4). After mixing E51 with p-cresol or PpC-a-acylated, due to the poor reactivity, nearly no viscosity change
of E51/p-cresol and E51/PpC-a-acylated
was observed during the evaluation period. However, after mixing E51
with p-cresol and N,N-DEBA, owing to the high reactivity, the viscosity of E51/p-cresol/N,N-DEBA increased
by 90 times in 4 days and the mixture solidified in 5 days. Although
no obvious reactions occurred between N,N-DEBA and E51, judging from the DSC test results, the viscosity of
E51/N,N-DEBA increased rapidly and
the mixture solidified in 8 days. This might have resulted from the
impurities, such as the primary amine and secondary amine, in N,N-DEBA. In the case of E51/PpC-a and E51/PpC-b, as expected, a slight increase
in viscosity was observed during the evaluation period (4 weeks).
This indicated that E51/PpC-a and E51/PpC-b possessed excellent storage stability, owing to the blocking
of hydrogen bonds at RT, and the shelf life of epoxy/polybenzoxazine
mixtures surpassed that of the mixtures of epoxy and small molecular
latent curing agents, which made polybenzoxazines great thermal latent
curing agents for epoxy resins.

Figure 4 Summary of storage stability.

2.5 Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)
As
mentioned previously, this study also attempted to enhance the properties
of epoxy resin using polybenzoxazines as curing agents; hence, DMA
was applied to evaluate the performance. The results are shown in Figures S6 and S7 and Table 1. As can be seen from Table 1, when the molar ratio of polybenzoxazines/epoxy
is 1:4, the storage moduli of the copolymers were highly boosted in
comparison to those of the polymers cured by p-cresol
and N,N-DEBA. As the amount of the
curing agent increased (molar ratio 1:2), the performance of the copolymers
derived from E51/polybenzoxazines improved; for example, the Tg and the modulus of poly(E51/PpC-a) were 147.8 °C and 4013 MPa, respectively. Nevertheless,
because
of the excess of residues in poly(E51/N,N-DEBA/p-cresol), the desired samples were not obtained.
So, as thermal latent curing agents, polybenzoxazines not only possess
good storage stability but also can enhance the performance of the
epoxy resin.

3 Conclusions
In summary, this work focuses on applying polybenzoxazines as thermal
latent curing agents. The interesting chemical structures and hydrogen
bonds make polybenzoxazines very suitable for use as thermal latent
curing agents. At ambient temperature, hydrogen bonds of polybenzoxazines
can block the reactivity of phenolic hydroxyl and give the polybenzoxazines/epoxy
mixtures excellent storage stability; as the temperature increases,
active phenolic hydroxyl is generated and the curing reaction occurs
rapidly. More interestingly, the afforded copolymers of polybenzoxazines
and epoxy resins exhibit enhanced properties. This finding is anticipated
to motivate researchers to search for novel superior curing agents
and apply polybenzoxazines more widely.

Scheme 1 Synthesis Route of pC-a, pC-b, PpC-a, and
PpC-b
4.4 Synthesis and Characterization of PpC-a-acylated
A solution of PpC-a (45.00
g, 0.2 mol —OH) and Et3N (11.18 g, 0.26 mol) in
CH2Cl2 (60.00 g) was stirred in a 250 mL three-necked
flask, while a solution of acetylchloride (20.41 g, 0.26 mol) in CH2Cl2 (65.00 g) was added to it dropwise over 45
min with the aid of a 100 mL constant-pressure funnel. The reaction
was carried out in an ice water bath and under a N2 atmosphere
for 3 h; then, the mixture was heated and refluxed for 5 h. Thereafter,
the reaction system was cooled to RT and neutralized with an aqueous
solution of NaHCO3 (0.08 wt %), which was added dropwise
until no more bubbles were produced; then, the oil phase was washed
several times with distilled water until the pH of the washing water
was neutral. Then, the water was separated and the organic solvent
was evaporated in a rotary evaporator to remove most of the solvent.
Finally, the product was dried under vacuum at 70 °C for 3 h,
yielding a pale yellow
powder (Scheme 2).

4.5 Curing Procedure of
E51/PpC-a, E51/PpC-b, and E51/N,N-DEBA/p-cresol
E51 and polybenzoxazine were mixed homogeneously by stirring at 120
°C; then, the mixtures were transferred to aluminum molds. The
samples were degassed at 120 °C for 1 h, followed by heating
at 120, 140, and 160 °C for 2 h, respectively, and 180 °C
for 1 h. For E51/N,N-DEBA/p-cresol,
due to the volatility of N,N-DEBA
and p-cresol at high temperature and their high reactivity,
curing was conducted at a relatively lower temperature (50, 60, 70,
80, 90, 100, 110, 120, and 130 °C for 2 h, respectively). Then,
the corresponding cast
samples were polished to DMA specimens.
