In
this paper, we report a simple two-step approach for the synthesis
of large graphene oxide (GO) sheets with lateral dimensions of ≈10
μm or greater. The first step is a pretreatment step involving
electrochemical exfoliation of graphite electrode to produce graphene
in a mixture of H2SO4 and H3PO4. The second step is the oxidation step, where oxidation of
exfoliated graphene sheets was performed using KMnO4 as
the oxidizing agent. The oxidation was carried out for different times
ranging from 1 to 12 h at ∼60 °C. Prepared GO batches
were characterized using a number of spectroscopy and microscopy techniques
such as X-ray diffraction (XRD), field emission scanning electron
microscopy (FE-SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and UV–visible spectroscopy.
Raman and thermogravimetric analysis techniques were used to study
the degree of oxidation in the as-synthesized GO batches. The UV–visible
absorption spectrum showed an intense peak at 230 nm and an adjacent
band at 300 nm corresponding to π–π* and n−π*
transitions in all samples. Normalized FTIR plots were used to calculate
the relative percentages of oxygen-containing functional groups, which
were found to be maximum in GO (6 h). Boehm titration was used to
quantify the functional groups present on the GO surface. Overall
GO sheets obtained after 6 h of oxidation, GO (6 h), were found to
be the best. XRD pattern of GO (6 h) revealed a characteristic peak
at 2θ = 8.88°, with the corresponding interplanar spacing
between the layers being 0.995 nm, which is among the best with respect
to the previous methods reported in the literature. Raman spectroscopy
showed that the degree of defect (ID/IG) area ratio for GO (6 h) was 1.24, which is
higher than that obtained for GO (1.18) prepared by widely used Marcano’s
approach.

Introduction
Graphene is an emerging
two-dimensional carbon material containing
sp2 hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal array.1−4 It is a future material due to its excellent physicochemical properties
such as high surface area (2630 m2 g–1), thermal conductivity (5000 W m–1 K–1), Young’s modulus (1 TPa), electron mobility (2.5 ×
105 cm2 V–1 s–1), relatively high electrical conductivity at room temperature (of
the order of 106), and chemical durability.5−10 Due to its extraordinary structure-related properties, it has found
potential applications in various fields of science and engineering,
including biotechnology, energy, and environment.11−14 Some of the commonly used methods
for the preparation of graphene include scotch tape method, chemical
vapor deposition, liquid-phase exfoliation, electrochemical exfoliation,
and chemical reduction of graphene oxide (GO). Among them, chemical
reduction of GO to yield graphene sheets is the most widely used technique
due to its cost-effectiveness and feasibility of processing. In this
process, graphite is first oxidized to give GO nanosheets using Hummers’
method and then reduced to yield graphene. During oxidation, C=C
double bonds break down and oxygen functional groups, such as −COOH,
−OH, and C–O–C, are introduced in the basal plane
and at the edges of the graphene sheets. These functional groups are
further reduced by chemical, thermal, and electrochemical treatments.

The well-known Hummers’ method was introduced by Hummers
and Offman in 1958, which made use of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium permanganate (KMnO4) in H2SO4 for performing oxidation of graphite flakes. Generation of
toxic gases, residual nitrate content, and low yield are some of the
major flaws of the Hummers’ process.15−23 Later, several modifications have been proposed in the Hummers’
process to synthesize GO sheets with high degree of oxidation.20,22,24 In 2010, Marcano and co-workers
replaced NaNO3 with H3PO4. They concluded
that GO prepared using KMnO4, H2SO4, and H3PO4 exhibit higher degree of oxidation
compared to that synthesized using KMnO4, H2SO4, and NaNO3. Also, they reported that this,
often called improved Hummers’ method, does not produce any
toxic gases and is suitable for large-scale production of GO.

Recently, some more methods have been reported for synthesizing
GO, which include elimination of NaNO3 from reaction mixture
or using K2FeO4 instead of KMnO4 or
using K2FeO4 + KMnO4. A consolidated
list of various techniques reported for the GO synthesis is given
in Table 1. In the
past, the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite has been performed
to obtain graphene using different types of electrolyte solutions,
such as organic/inorganic salts or solvents, bases, strong acids,
oxidants, polymers, ionic liquids (sodium tungstate) aqueous solution,
tetrasodium pyrophosphate, potassium sulfate, NaOH, sulfuric acid
(H2SO4), phosphoric acid (H3PO4), HNO3, HCl, HBr, cetyl trimethylammonium bromide,
and protic ionic liquid.25−34

work	
Most of
the studies in the literature use GO synthesized by Marcano’s
approach using graphite powder as the precursor. The motivation for
the present work was to synthesize graphene oxide sheets using graphite
electrode as precursor material. The purpose of using electrochemical
approach is to exfoliate or to peel off graphite layers from electrode
into the reaction mixture and further oxidize the material to synthesize
GO sheets. Most of the previously reported synthesis methodologies
require longer time, which increases the production cost. This is
due to the fact that the slow diffusion of oxidants between the graphene
sheets restricts the formation of GO.20 Present study also aims to minimize the time required for synthesizing
GO. It may be noted that the electrochemical approach is easily scalable
as well.

In the present study, we report the synthesis of GO
from graphite
electrode. First, graphite was exfoliated from graphite electrode
in acidic mixture (H2SO4 + H3PO4), which caused exfoliation of graphene layer and increased
the interlayer spacing between the sheets. In the second step, the
exfoliated graphene sheets were oxidized using KMnO4. The
obtained GO sheets were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD),
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV–visible and
Raman spectroscopy. The morphological characteristics of the sheets
was analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM)
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques.

Results and Discussion
Structure
and Microstructure Studies
The XRD patterns
of graphite electrode and exfoliated graphite are shown in Figure 1a. Pristine graphite
exhibits it characteristic diffraction peak at 2θ = 27.6°
for the (002) plane, with an interlayer d-spacing
of 0.323 nm determined using Bragg’s law equation 1  where n = 1 and θ is
the Bragg’s angle. In case of exfoliated graphite, diffraction
peak for the (002) plane was observed at 2θ = 26.4° for
which the interlayer d-spacing was determined as
0.337 nm. After exfoliation of graphene sheets from graphite electrode,
an insignificant change in d-spacing was observed.
This indicates that only pure graphene sheets are peeled off from
electrode without any chemical modification (i.e., oxidation) into
the electrolyte solution. The XRD patterns of different batches of
GO are shown in Figure 1b. Results revealed that with increasing reaction times, the (002)
peak shifts toward lower 2θ value, suggesting an increase in
the interlayer d-spacing. The d-spacing
observed for GO (12 h) was determined as 1.046 nm, which is 1.18 times
greater than that of GO synthesized using Marcano’s approach.
Also, the diffraction peak observed for different GO batches is broader
compared to that of precursor material graphite, suggesting deterioration
in the crystallinity of the material (Figure 1b). Therefore, it can be concluded that well-separated
GO sheets were obtained using our two-step method.16,17,20,23,35,36

electrode and exfoliated graphite
and (b) different GO batches.

Raman spectroscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing
graphene
and its derivatives. Raman spectra of different GO batches are shown
in Figure S1 (Supporting Information).
Defect-free graphite exhibits characteristic G-band at 1579 cm–1 in Raman spectroscopy, which corresponds to E2g vibration mode of sp2 hybridized carbon atoms.
Upon oxidation from graphite to GO, rupturing of C=C double
bond occurs, which results in the generation of sp3 hybridized
carbon.37−39 The presence of sp3 hybridized carbon
atoms in GO is reflected by a defect band at 1357 cm–1, which is also known as D-band.40 The
ratio of the area of D-band to G-band, i.e., ID/IG, gives the measure of the
disorderness/defects in GO.41 The area
ratios ID/IG for different GO batches are shown in Figure 2. It should be noteworthy here that with
an increase in the oxidation time, ID/IG ratio increases significantly up the oxidation
time of 6 h and then decreases. The highest value of the ID/IG ratio of 1.24 was achieved
for the GO batch corresponding to 6 h. A further increase in oxidation
time resulted in the lowering of ID/IG ratio. The reason for this may be the structural
dominance of graphene sheets over the disordered areas, which causes
lowering of the intensity of D-band.42−45 For GO batch prepared using Marcano’s
approach, the ID/IG ratio was determined as 1.18, which is lower compared to
the ID/IG ratio
for the GO (6 h) batch.

Figure 2 Calculated crystallite sizes from Raman and
XRD data, and the ID/IG area ratio

Raman spectroscopy was further
used to determine the crystallite
size of the as-synthesized GO sheet. The formula used for calculating
the crystallite size is given below41−43 2  where La is the
crystallite size and λ is the wavelength of laser source (514
nm). The crystallite size obtained for different GO batches are shown
in Figure 2. The crystallite
size for GO (1 h) batch was determined as 20.9 nm, which reduced to
13.5 nm when reaction was performed for 6 h. This decrease in crystallite
size is attributed to the decrease in the GO domains due to the oxidation-induced
structural disorder in the form of sp3 hybridized carbon
atoms. Also, increase in oxidation time beyond 6 h caused an increase
in the crystallite size. The crystallite size of GO prepared using
Marcano’s approach is greater than that of GO (6 h) batch,
suggesting that more defect levels were induced using our approach
compared to Marcano’s approach. The crystallite size of the
as-prepared sheets was also determined using the Debye–Scherrer
equation (D = 0.94λ/(β cos θ),
where λ is the X-ray wavelength (0.15404 nm), β is the
full width at half-maximum, and θ is the diffraction angle).
The crystallite sizes from XRD data of different GO batches (Figure 2) were found be in
the range of 3.3–4.3 nm. It is seen that there is difference
in crystallite size range as calculated from XRD and Raman spectra.
This is due to the fact that crystallite size calculated from Raman
spectra depends on the excitation wavelength. Raman spectra obtained
from lower excitation wavelength is likely to give crystallite size
similar to that obtained from XRD data.43

Chemical and Molecular Study
The FTIR spectra of pristine
graphite are shown in Figure 3a, which consist of low-intensity peaks at 3434 and 1630 cm–1 for O–H and C=C stretching vibrations
modes, respectively. The presence of various functional groups in
different GO batches is observed in the FTIR spectra (Figure 3a). Different batches of GO
sheets reveal a peak at 3434 cm–1, which is attributed
to the O–H stretching vibration modes of −COOH and C–OH
functional groups. Further, all of the GO batches show peaks at 1747
and 1637 cm–1, which are attributed to C=O
stretching and C=C bending vibration modes. For other functional
groups like C–O–H and C–O–C, peaks appeared
at 1403, 1235, and 1045 cm–1.20,23,46−48

Figure 3 (a) FTIR plots for GO
batches; (b, c) normalized FTIR plot; and
(d) RPOCFG profile for GO samples with varying oxidation
times and Marcano’s method (M).

A more detailed study of the structures of the as-prepared
GO batches
was obtained by plotting normalized FTIR plots (according to the procedure
reported by Guerrero-Contreras and Caballero-Briones),43 which are shown in Figure 3b,c. The normalized FTIR data of various
GO batches revealed prominent peaks at 1724, 1622, 1407, 1226, and
1044 cm–1 for C=O stretch in carboxylic,
C=C aromatic stretch, C–O–C ether, C–OH
stretch in acids, and C–O–C epoxy groups, respectively.
The intensity of various peaks increased with an increase in reaction
time and attains maxima for GO (6 h). The intensity of peaks for oxygen-containing
functional groups was found to decrease at higher reaction times (>6
h). It should be noteworthy here that the intensities of various peaks
in GO prepared by Marcano’s approach are significantly lower
compared to those of GO (6 h), suggesting higher concentration of
oxygen-containing functional groups in GO (6 h). The deconvoluted
FTIR spectra for the range of 1500–1850 cm–1 for all GO batches is given in Supporting Information Figure S2. The deconvoluted spectrum of GO (1
h) showed a single peak for aromatic C=C stretch at 1622 cm–1. However, a new peak was observed at 1580 cm–1 for batches corresponding to 2 h or more, which is
again assigned to C=C stretching vibrational mode of substituted
aromatic rings in GO. It was also observed that the intensity of this
peak increased with time, indicating an increase in the concentration
of substituted aromatic ring in the samples. This increase is due
to introduction of various functional group in the graphene network.
The maximum intensity of this peak was achieved for the GO (6 h) batch,
suggesting the presence of higher concentration of functional group
compared to other batches.

The degree of oxidation of different
GO batches was further evaluated
by calculating the relative percentage of oxygen-containing functional
groups (RPOCFG) with respect to the presence of all functional
groups observed in the wavenumber range of 900–1850 cm–1 (for all peaks in Figure 3b,c). RPOCFG was calculated using
the following formula43 3  Figure 3d presents the value of RPOCFG in different GO batches. It was observed that the value of RPOCFG increased with an increase in the time of oxidation. The
highest value of RPOCFG of 68.1% was achieved for GO (6
h) batch, which reflects the highest concentration of oxygen-containing
functional groups in the sample. For other GO samples, the RPOCFG values were lower. This indicates that the lower oxidation
degree was achieved for these batches. Also, GO prepared using Marcano’s
approach gave RPOCFG < 68.1%.

XPS analysis, shown
in Figure 4, further
reveals the chemical composition and binding
states of carbon and oxygen in GO (6 h). The XPS images of GO (6 h)
are mainly composed of C 1s and O 1s. Figure 4a shows the deconvoluted spectra of C 1s,
in which three characteristic peaks are fitted at 284.38, 286.69,
and 288.54 eV for C–C/C=C bond (sp2 and sp3 structure), C–OH/C–OC bond, and O=C–OH
groups, respectively.49Figure 4b shows the deconvoluted spectra
of O 1s, which also shows the presence of three characteristics peaks
at 531.44, 532.81, and 533.74 eV corresponding to C=O, C–OH,
and adsorbed water molecules.50,51 The XPS images of the
GO (6 h) batch revealed peaks corresponding to C 1s and O 1s only,
suggesting the absence of any other impurity in the prepared sample.
Further, the degree of oxidation achieved was explain in terms of
O/C ratio, which is determined as 0.531.

(b) O 1s spectra of GO (6 h).

Boehm titration is a qualitative as well as quantitative
tool for
the determination of various oxygen-containing functional groups,
such as carboxylic acid, phenols, and lactones. This method is based
on the difference in the acidities of the above-mentioned functional
groups. The concentration of various types of acidic functional groups
is calculated under the assumptions that NaHCO3 neutralizes
carboxylic groups, Na2CO3 neutralizes carboxylic
acid and lactone, and NaOH neutralizes all carboxylic, lactonic, and
phenolic groups. The results of Boehm titration are shown in Figure 5. It is observed
that the concentration of phenolic group is maximum in the GO (1 h)
batch and minimum in the GO (6 h) batch. On the other hand, the concentration
of carboxylic and lactonic groups increases in a regular manner with
an increase in reaction time. This increase in carboxylic groups is
attributed to the oxidation of some of the hydroxyl groups to carbonyl
groups and then to carboxylic groups during the course of oxidation
reaction. Similarly, increase in lactonic functional groups is due
to the loss of water molecules from the adjacent carboxylic and phenol
groups (at the edge of GO sheets). The proposed oxidation mechanism
corroborates well with the available literature.12,52

varying oxidation times and Marcano’s method.

UV–Visible Studies
The structural
modification
of graphite by increasing the degree of oxidation so as to convert
it into GO is also evident from the UV–visible spectra shown
in Figure 6. Dispersions
of different GO batches were prepared in deionized water by ultrasonication
and their absorption spectra were recorded. It was observed that all
GO batches revealed a sharp absorption peak at ≈230 nm, which
corresponds to the electronic excitation form π → π*
molecular orbital of the aromatic sp2 domains, i.e., C=C
bonds. In addition, a weak shoulder band was also observed at ≈300
nm, which was associated with the n → π* electronic transitions
due to various oxygen-containing functional groups, such as −COOH,
−CHO, and C–O–C. The increase in the intensity
at 300 nm is attributed to the presence of highly oxidized graphene
basal plane. This produces a greater amount of isolated aromatic rings
(or lesser amount of extended conjugated aromatic rings) in the prepared
GO batches, which in turn increases the intensity of C=C bonding
peak at ≈230 nm.50,53,54 Similar results were also reported in the literature.16,42,55

Figure 6 UV–visible spectra of different
GO batches.

Morphological Studies
The morphologies of different
GO batches were analyzed by FE-SEM, and the results are presented
in Figure 7a–g.
The SEM images of the GO sheets corresponding to 1 and 2 h (Figure 7a,b) reveal the formation
of poorly exfoliated wrinkled structures. It may be noted that the
lateral dimensions of sheets are of the order of 10 μm or greater
and fit the definition of large GO sheets.56 From energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurement, the C/O ratios for
the GO (1 h), GO (2 h), and GO (4 h) batches were determined as 1.13,
1.15, and 1.17, respectively. On the other hand, GO (6 h), GO (8 h),
GO (10 h), and GO (12 h) showed the formation of well-exfoliated sheet-like
morphology with curled edges. The C/O ratios for these batches were
found to be 0.94, 1.14, 1.21, and 1.28, respectively. The TEM images
of GO (6 h) at two different magnifications (Figure 7h,i) also reveal the formation of a thin
sheet. The crystallinity of GO sheets was also investigated by the
selected area electron diffraction (SAED) technique (Figure 7j), which showed the presence
of diffused concentric diffraction rings indicating low crystallinity
of the material.4,20,23 This observation is well corroborated with the result of XRD. Hence,
it can be concluded that the oxidation of graphite to graphene oxide
is accompanied with the worsening of the crystalline property of the
material. The semi-amorphous nature of GO has been reported by a number
of investigators.57,58

(10 h), and (g) GO (12 h); (h, i) TEM images of GO (6 h); and (j)

Thermogravimetric Studies
Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) technique was further used as a tool to analyze the degree of
oxidation and thermal stability of the as-synthesized GO batches.
TG curves of different GO batches are shown in Figure 8. GO batches obtained for various reaction
times revealed ca. 17–23% weight loss in the temperature range
of 25–150 °C due to the removal of physically adsorbed
and intercalated water molecules from the sheets. At 150 °C,
sudden weight loss was observed for different GO batches, which could
be due to the removal of labile oxygen-containing functional groups,
such as epoxy, hydroxyl, carboxylate, anhydride, or lactone, from
the surface of GO sheets. This indicates the presence of a large number
of oxygen-containing functional groups at the edges and in the basal
plane of graphene layers. This matches well with the FTIR and Boehm
studies, which showed the presence of a high amount of carboxylic
and lactonic groups in the GO samples obtained after oxidation for
6 h or longer. Moreover, EDX studies showed higher C/O ratio in these
GO samples with oxidation time of 6 h or longer. Also, weight loss
at 150 °C is more for the GO (6 h), GO (8 h), GO (10 h), and
GO (12 h) batches compared to the GO (1 h), GO (2 h), and GO (4 h)
batches. This indicates that with an increase in oxidation time, more
oxygen-containing functional groups get introduced in the graphene
skeleton, which makes GO thermally less stable. Weight loss in the
range of 40–500 °C is attributed to the removal of more
stable oxygen groups such as phenol and carbonyl. At temperatures
>500 °C, weight loss is due to pyrolysis of GO. Overall, findings
of TGA match well with those of FTIR and EDX studies, revealing high
concentration of oxygen-bearing functional groups, which are responsible
for the low thermal stability of the prepared GO samples.16,20,23,59

profiles of different GO batches.

Reaction Mechanism
The schematic representation of
the method of GO synthesis using our two-step approach is shown in Figure 9. Briefly, graphite
layers got exfoliated from the graphite electrode during the electrochemical
step and formed graphite intercalated compound upon insertion of ionic
species, such as HSO4–, SO42–, and H+ ions, from H2SO4. In the second step, KMnO4 was added to the reaction
mixture, which formed highly reactive dimanganese heptoxide (Mn2O7) species upon reaction with H2SO4.60,61 Mn2O7 oxidized the
defective sites over aromatic double bonds present in graphene skeleton.
The reaction of defect centers with Mn2O7 introduced
functional groups, which upon hydration with water yield −OH
groups. During the course of reaction, loss of water molecule from
two −OH groups occurs to from epoxy linkages. Further, sulfonic
acid (−RSO3) groups are attached to the edges of
the graphene structure, which upon hydration get converted into carboxylic
groups.60

Conclusions
Graphene oxide sheets
were successfully synthesized through a very
simple electrochemical exfoliation of graphite followed by oxidation
with KMnO4. The sheets were further characterized using
different spectroscopy and microscopy techniques. It was found from
XRD, Raman, and FTIR studies that the maximum degree of oxidation
was achieved for the GO (6 h) batch. The interlayer spacing between
the graphene sheets in GO (6 h) was determined as 0.995 nm with an ID/IG ratio of 1.24.
The relative percentage of oxygen-containing functional groups in
GO (6 h) as calculated from normalized FTIR plots was found to be
the highest (68.1%). XPS and Boehm titration methods were further
used to determine the binding states and concentration of various
oxygen-containing functional groups in GO batches. UV–visible
spectra of different batches of GO revealed a sharp intensity peak
at ∼230 nm and a weak adjacent band at ∼300 nm. A detailed
characterization of various GO batches reveal the formation of highly
exfoliated and oxidized GO sheets with wrinkled surface and curled
edges after 6 h of oxidation.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Graphite
electrodes with dimensions of 10
cm × 1.5 cm × 0.5 cm were obtained from Graphite India Limited,
Delhi. Graphite flakes with a mesh size of ∼20 μm were
obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, India. Sulfuric acid (H2SO4, 98%), hydrochloric acid (HCl), diethyl ether (C4H10O), and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2, 30%) were procured from HiMedia India Pvt. Ltd. Potassium permanganate
(KMnO4), orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4), and ethanol (C2H5OH) were procured from
Merck, India. All reagents were of analytical grade and used without
purification.

Synthesis of GO Sheets
Synthesis
of GO from graphite
electrode was done in two steps: (i) exfoliation of graphene from
graphite electrodes so as to peel off/scratch the graphene sheets
from graphite electrode with the help of applied current and (ii)
oxidation of graphene into GO. In the first step, two graphite electrodes
(separated by a distance of 1.5 cm) were employed as anode and cathode.
They were dipped in a 66 mL mixture of H2SO4 and H3PO4 with a volume ratio of 9:1. A static
current of 1.00 ± 0.1 A, optimized separately, was passed through
the electrodes for 4 min using a direct current power supply, which
caused exfoliation of graphite from the anode. The amount of exfoliated
graphite was determined to be in the range of 0.5–0.6 g.

Thereafter, electrodes were withdrawn from the solution. In the second
step, 3 g of KMnO4 was added into the reaction mixture
containing exfoliated graphite. The reaction mixture was stirred at
55–60 °C using a water bath for different oxidation time
(1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 h) to understand the effect of time on
the levels of oxidation. Thereafter, the reaction mixture was cooled
to room temperature and the oxidation reaction was quenched by adding
70 mL of ice water containing 2 mL of H2O2.
A brownish golden solid material synthesized up to this time was separated
by centrifugation and subsequently washed three times with deionized
water to remove any of the unreacted material. Further, the solid
material was washed with 50 mL of 30% hydrochloric acid (HCl) and
30 mL of ethanol and finally coagulated with diethyl ether. During
this process, coagulation of the bunches of sheets takes place. These
bunches were separated into sheets (with five to seven layers each)
by sonicating the obtained material in water using a probe sonicator
for 1 h and then drying at 60 °C in a Petri dish. Different GO
batches were referred to as GO (1 h), GO (2 h), GO (4 h), GO (6 h),
GO (8 h), GO (10 h), and GO (12 h), where the text in parentheses
represents the time of oxidation. For comparison, GO was also synthesized
by widely used Marcano’s method using graphite powder as a
precursor according to the method developed earlier by performing
oxidation for 12 h20 and further characterized
by different methods. The schematic representation of the method of
synthesis is given in Figure 10.

Characterization Techniques
Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns of prepared samples were recorded by a Bruker ARS D8 Advance
diffractometer in the angular range of 5–90° with a scan
rate of 2° min–1 and using Cu Kα (λ = 0.15404 nm) as X-ray source, operated at 40 kV. Raman
spectra of the samples were obtained by an inVia Raman microscope
(Renishaw) using a monochromatic laser source of wavelength λ
= 514 nm. The absorption spectra of the GO samples were obtained using
a Shimadzu UV-1800 spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 200–800
nm. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of GO was performed
using a Nicolet Nexus instrument to identify the functional groups
present in different samples of GO. KBr pellets of the dried samples
were scanned in the wavenumber range of 4000–400 cm–1 so as to obtain transmittance (%) versus wavenumber graphs. Transmission
electron microscope and field emission scanning electron microscope
(FE-SEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) systems were used
for the analysis of the morphological characteristics of the as-synthesized
GO sheets. The transmission electron microscope was operated at 200
kV, and the field emission scanning electron microscope/energy-dispersive
X-ray device was operated at 15 kV. XPS analysis was conducted using
PHI 5000 versa probe III.

Analysis of Functional Moieties
The Boehm titration
method was used for analyzing the concentration and nature of functional
groups that are introduced in the graphene skeleton during oxidation.
Briefly, 0.1 g of GO sheets was dispersed in 100 mL of 0.1 M NaOH,
NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 separately. The
obtained dispersion was mechanically stirred for 48 h at room temperature
and then filtered to separate GO sheets from solution. Thereafter,
5 mL extracts of NaOH, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 were titrated with 0.05 M HCl using phenolphthalein as indicator.
A controlled experiment without GO sheets was also performed for proper
calculations.
