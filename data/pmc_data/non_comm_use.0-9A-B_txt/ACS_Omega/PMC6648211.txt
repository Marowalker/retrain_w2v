4,6-Dihydroxysalicylic
acid was activated under air to catalyze
the one-pot oxidative condensation reaction of benzylamines with acetophenones
in the presence of BF3·Et2O, affording
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines in yields of 59–91%. During
this metal-free oxidative condensation reaction, the benzylamines
not only provided the aryl moiety at the 4-position of the pyridines
but also acted as the nitrogen donor. This method can be applied to
the metal-free synthesis of G-quadruplex binding ligands by the sequential
addition of 4-chlorobutyryl chloride and pyrrolidine to the reaction
system of the 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridine synthesis.

==== Body
Introduction
Pyridines are one of
the most important N-containing
heterocycles with applications in many fields1 such as organic synthesis,2 materials
science,3 and pharmaceutical science.4 Currently, pyridine-based natural compounds continue
to be discovered and studied for their properties and biosynthesis.5 Within the pyridine family, 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridines have garnered great attention because their excellent thermal
stability6 makes them excellent ligands
for various metals.7 For example, cyclometalated
Au(III) complexes featuring a tridentate C^N^C scaffold have proven
to be effective anticancer drugs (Figure 1, [Au(Ph-C^N^C)Cl]).8 Moreover, 2,4,6-triarylpyridines are a class of G-quadruplex binding
ligands that stabilize G-quadruplex DNA (G4-DNA) and provide an efficient
approach to cancer treatment (Figure 1, G-quadruplex binding ligands).9

The traditional synthetic strategies
toward the construction of
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines require three components, one of which
is an additional nitrogen source.10 Recently,
simple two-component condensation reactions for the synthesis of 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridines have been developed.11 However,
most of their starting materials, such as oximes12 and chalcones,13 are not commercially
available. Benzylamines are considered efficient substrates for the
synthesis of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines and play a dual role of
providing an aryl functionality at the 4-position of the pyridines
as well as being a nitrogen source. The use of transition metal catalysts
is one of the powerful methods to synthesize 2,4,6-triarylpyridines
via the oxidative condensation reaction of benzylamines with acetophenones.14 Moreover, metal-free versions of the reaction
were recently reported, as shown in Scheme 1. Although these limited methods provide
complementary pathways toward the synthesis of 2,4,6-triarylpyridines,
corrosive trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (eq 1),15 iodine at relatively high temperature (140 °C) (eq
2),16 or complex photoredox catalyst eosin
Y with a noncatalytic amount of BF3·Et2O (50 mol %) upon additional photoirradiation (eq 3)17 were needed. Because of these disadvantages, development
of a one-pot synthesis of drug candidates via the application of 2,4,6-triarylpyridines
becomes difficult. In addition, their limited substrate scopes, especially
difficulties with amino groups, make it impossible to apply these
reactions to the synthesis of G-quadruplex binding ligands. Therefore,
the development of metal-free, catalytic methods for 2,4,6-triarylpyridines
synthesis is strongly desired.

Scheme 1 Synthesis of 2,4,6-Trisubstituted
Pyridines
We recently developed
a metal-free method to oxidize benzylamines
to imines using salicylic acid derivatives as organocatalysts, and
successfully applied this efficient method to synthesize N-containing heterocycles and blue dyes.18 Herein, we report an efficient protocol to synthesize 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridines by the 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid-catalyzed oxidative condensation
of benzylamines and acetophenones in the air, and the application
of this method to the synthesis of G-quadruplex binding ligands in
two steps (Scheme 1, eq 4). Note that most of the previously reported procedures to
synthesize G-quadruplex binding ligands require three or four steps;
all of these procedures start from the three-component reaction of
aldehydes, 4-aminoacetophenones, and nitrogen donors to obtain 2,4,6-triarylpyridines,
followed by stepwise reaction of the isolated 2,4,6-triarylpyridines
with 4-chlorobutyryl chloride and pyrrolidine.9 To our delight, our present work provides the first example for
the synthesis of G-quadruplex binding ligands starting from benzylamines
and 4-aminoacetophenones. The resulting mixtures containing 2,4,6-triarylpyridines
bearing amino groups were then allowed to react directly with 4-chlorobutyryl
chlorides without an intermediate purification step. After a simple
reaction workup, the residues were next reacted with pyrrolidines
to successfully afford G-quadruplex binding ligands. Therefore, this
metal-free method for the synthesis of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines
and G-quadruplex binding ligands is facile, efficient, and time-saving.

Results
and Discussion
To begin the study, 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid (2.5 mol %)18 was employed as an organocatalyst,
and 4-methoxyacetophenone
(2a, 1.0 mmol) was chosen as the model substrate for
condensation with benzylamine (1a, 0.5 mmol) under 0.1
MPa of O2 atmosphere (via an O2 balloon) at
100 °C for 24 h. A survey of different solvents (0.5 mL) suggested
that dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was the optimal solvent to afford 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridine 4a in 45% yield (Table 1, entries 1–7). Increasing the amount
of 1a up to 1.0 mmol resulted in the formation of 4a in 56% yield under an O2 atmosphere (entry 8).
Removing the O2 balloon and conducting the reaction in
air slightly improved the yield of 4a (entry 9). Therefore,
we continued to optimize the reaction in air. A decrease in the amount
of DMSO (0.1 mL) was favorable for the formation of 4a (entry 10). BF3·Et2O was found to be
an efficient additive for the reaction, and the loading of BF3·Et2O could be decreased to 10 mol % (entries
11–17). In the presence of BF3·Et2O (5 mol %), 1.0 mmol of 2a could be coupled with 1.5
mmol of benzylamine to form 4a in 77% yield (entry 13).
Further increasing the amount of BF3·Et2O to 10 mol % promoted the formation of 4a (79%, entry
14). A higher loading of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid (5 mol %) gave 4a in 81% yield, whereas an even higher loading (10 mol %)
was not needed (entries 15–16). Using 5 mol % of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic
acid and increasing the amount of BF3·Et2O (20 mol %) hindered the reaction (entry 17). A large excess of
benzylamine (3.0 mmol) gave a similar yield of 4a (entry
18) to the reaction with less benzylamine (1.5 mmol, entry 15). The
neat reaction was inefficient for the formation of 4a (entry 19). The optimal conditions for the reaction were 4-methoxyacetophenone
(2a, 1.0 mmol) and benzylamine (1a, 1.5
mmol) in the presence of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid (5 mol %) as
the organocatalyst and BF3·Et2O (10 mol
%) as the additive at 100 °C for a short reaction time (18 h)
in the air to form 4a in 83% yield (entry 20). A shorter
reaction time (12 h), lower temperature (80 °C), or higher temperature
(120 °C) gave disappointing results (entries 21–23).

With the
optimized reaction conditions in hand (Table 1, entry 20), the scope of the
substrates was next investigated. A series of benzylamines were examined
to couple with 4-methoxyacetophenone (Table 2). More specifically, when benzylamines with
a methyl substituent at the ortho and para positions were employed as substrates, the corresponding 2,4,6-triarylpyridines 4b–4c were obtained in high yields. A methoxy substituent
at the ortho, meta, and para positions of benzylamines underwent the condensation
reaction with 2a to give the desired products 4d–4f. Benzylamines bearing other substituents, such as 4-tert-butyl, 3-chloro, and 4-chloro, were also examined under the standard
reaction conditions, and 2,4,6-triarylpyridines 4g–4i were formed in good to high yields. A strong electron-withdrawing
group, 4-trifluoromethyl, resulted in a somewhat sluggish reaction
for the formation of the product 4j. In addition, several
activated primary amines such as 1-naphthylmethylamine (1k), furfurylamine (1l), 2-pyridinemethylamine (1m), and 2-thiophenemethylamine (1n) were examined.
1-Naphthylmethylamine and 2-thiophenemethylamine could be successfully
transformed into the corresponding 2,4,6-triarylpyridines 4k and 4n. Product 4k in particular was obtained
in excellent yield (91%). The reactions of furfurylamine and 2-pyridinemethylamine
did not proceed well, probably because of the low conversion of amines
to imines (4l–4m). When 2-pyridinemethylamine
was employed, the competitive α-alkylation reaction of ketones
resulted in a 32% yield of 6. The gram-scale synthesis
of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines was also successful under the standard
reaction conditions; 1.38 g (3.75 mmol, 75% isolated yield) of 4a was obtained from 10 mmol of 2a (1.5 g) after
increasing the reaction time to 3 days.

b Gram
scale: 1a (15
mmol), 2a (10 mmol), 3 (0.5 mmol), BF3·Et2O (1.5 mmol), and DMSO (1.0 mL) were stirred
together for 3 days.

The
substrate scope was further investigated using a variety of
acetophenone derivatives to couple with benzylamine under the optimized
reaction conditions (Table 3). First, acetophenone derivatives bearing methyl substituents
at the ortho, meta, and para positions were examined and produced the corresponding
2,4,6-triarylpyridines 5b–5d in moderate to good
yields. It is believed that steric hindrance of the ortho-methyl group might be responsible for the reduced yield of 5b (compare 5b vs 5c and 5d). This situation also occurred in the reaction with ortho-methoxyacetophenone; 5e was formed in a low yield,
whereas the outcomes of the meta- and para-methoxy substituents were better (compare 5e vs 5f and Table 2, 4a). The acetophenone derivative with a para-tert-butyl substituent gave the corresponding product 5g in good yield. In contrast, acetophenone derivatives bearing
electron-withdrawing groups such as ortho-chloro, para-chloro, para-bromo, para-iodo, and para-trifluoromethyl gave moderate yields
of the products 5h–5l. Activated ketones were
also examined under the standard reaction conditions. The reaction
of 2′-acetonaphthone afforded the corresponding 2,4,6-triarylpyridine 5m in good yield. When 2-acetylfuran was employed, pyrrole
derivative 7, instead of 5n, was formed via the Clauson-Kaas reaction of 2-acetylfuran
and benzylamine. 2-Acetylthiophene tolerated the condensation reaction
to afford 5o in moderate yield, whereas the reaction
of 2-acetylpyridine gave the product 5p in a low yield.
An aliphatic ketone was also examined under the optimized reaction
conditions and gave an acceptable outcome (5q).

Pyridines Using Various Acetophenonesa

To gain insight into the reaction mechanism of this pyridine synthesis,
several control experiments were conducted as shown in Scheme 2 (eqs 5–10). As expected
given our previous work,18 benzylamine
(1a) could be oxidized to imine 8 under
the standard reaction conditions, and 10% of aldehyde 9 was also generated, most probably because of water from the air
(Scheme 2, eq 5). Imine 8 was employed as substrate to couple with 2a and afforded 4a in 38% yield, whereas amine 10, which could also be generated from benzylamine, failed to give
the pyridine product (eqs 6 and 7). The use of imine 8 in combination with benzylamine (1a, 0.5 mmol) as substrates
for reaction with 2a provided 4a in 73%
yield (eq 8). These results suggested that an imine might be the intermediate
for this pyridine synthesis, and that benzylamines play the dual role
of providing the aryl moiety at the 4-position of the 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridines as well as acting as the nitrogen donor. When the reaction
of benzylamine (1a, 1.0 mmol), ketone (2a, 1.0 mmol), and 4-tolualdehyde (11, 1.0 mmol) was conducted
under the standard reaction conditions, 4c bearing a para-methyl-substituted pyridine was obtained in 49% yield,
whereas only a trace of 4a was formed (eq 9). This result
might indicate that an aldehyde is the key intermediate for this pyridine
synthesis. Then, the reaction of 1a, 2a,
and 11 was also performed in argon atmosphere, and as
a result, 49% of imine 12 was formed as the main product
(eq 10). Compounds 13a and 14, which were
speculated as the intermediates for this reaction, were also detected.
Moreover, 7% of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridine 4c was
formed probably via the oxidation of 1,4-dihydropyridine 17 (vide infra) by a trace amount of oxygen in reagents. These results
suggest that the nitrogen source for the formation of 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridine is benzylamine.

Scheme 2 Control Experiments
On the basis of these control experiments, a mechanism
for the
synthesis of 2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines is proposed, as shown
in Scheme 3. In the
presence of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid, benzylamine (1a) can be oxidized to imine 8.18 Then, the hydrolysis of the imine may generate aldehyde 9 and 1a, which is a reversible reaction. Promoted by
BF3·Et2O, the keto–enol tautomerism
of ketone 2a gives enol 15, which subsequently
undergoes a condensation reaction with aldehyde 9 to
afford the intermediate 13b. Besides, the condensation
of 2a and 1a forms the intermediate 14, which transforms to 16 in the presence of
BF3·Et2O. A further addition reaction occurs
between 16 and 13b, leading
to the formation of 1,4-dihydropyridine 17, which undergoes
the oxidative aromatization to form the pyridine product 4a.

Scheme 3 Possible Pathway for the Synthesis of 2,4,6-Trisubstituted
Pyridines
2,4,6-Triarylpyridines
are a class of G-quadruplex binding ligands
that stabilize G4-DNA, which is very important for the treatment of
cancer.9 Herein, we applied this metal-free
synthetic method of pyridines to synthesize a series of G-quadruplex
binding ligands by adding 4-chlorobutyryl chloride and pyrrolidine (Table 4). First, benzylamine
(1a) was employed as the substrate, and the oxidative
condensation reaction of 1a with 4-aminoacetophenone
(2r) was conducted. Then, 4-chlorobutyryl chloride was
added directly into the reaction mixture and the mixture was stirred
overnight (>16 h) at 60 °C. The resulting dark mixture was
then
basified with a saturated NaHCO3 solution to obtain a dark
oil, which was easily separated from the mixture by pouring out the
water. The dark oil was then reacted with pyrrolidine overnight (>16
h) at room temperature to successfully afford G-quadruplex binding
ligand 18a in 65% yield. Thereafter, a series of benzylamine
derivatives were examined to synthesize G-quadruplex binding ligands.
Benzylamines with electron-donating groups such as methyl, methoxy,
and tert-butyl at the para positions afforded the
corresponding ligands 18b–18d in moderate yields.
Benzylamines bearing electron-withdrawing groups such as para-chloro and para-trifluoromethyl also gave the G-quadruplex
binding ligands 18e–18f in satisfactory yields.
1-Naphthylmethylamine was also examined, and the product 18g was successfully obtained. This method provides the first example
for the synthesis of G-quadruplex binding ligands starting from benzylamines
and 4-aminoactophenones. Compared with reported methods,9 which all require three or four steps, this procedure
is efficient and time-saving, only requiring two steps.

Conclusions
We have developed a metal-free and efficient method to synthesize
2,4,6-trisubstituted pyridines from benzylamines and acetophenones
in the presence of 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid and boron trifluoride-diethyl
etherate in air. During this pyridine synthesis, benzylamines play
a dual role of providing the aryl moiety at the 4-position of the
pyridines and acting as the nitrogen donor. 4,6-Dihydroxysalicylic
acid acts as an organocatalyst for the oxidation of benzylamines to
imines, which then undergo a hydrolysis reaction to generate aldehydes.
Facilitated by boron trifluoride-diethyl etherate, the condensation
reaction of aldehydes with acetophenones and benzylamines occurs,
and the adducts are readily oxidized to afford 2,4,6-trisubstituted
pyridines. This facile method can be applied to the synthesis of G-quadruplex
binding ligands by using 4-aminoacetophenone as the substrate and
subsequently adding 4-chlorobutyryl chloride and pyrrolidine to obtain
the corresponding G-quadruplex binding ligands in moderate yields.
In the drug discovery process, the synthetic methods that require
metal catalysts may cause significant problems because of the metal
residues in the products. To avoid metal contamination of the final
products, development of metal-free synthetic methods is strongly
desired. Further investigations of metal-free oxidations are currently
underway.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 2,4,6-Trisubstituted
Pyridines (5)
Benzylamine (1a,
160.74 mg, 1.5 mmol), the desired acetophenone derivative 2 (1.0 mmol), 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid (3, 8.5 mg,
0.05 mmol), and DMSO (0.1 mL) were added to a round-bottom flask,
and then BF3·Et2O (12.5 μL, 0.1 mmol)
was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100
°C for 18 h under air, then cooled to room temperature. The residue
was purified by silica gel chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate)
to give 5.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of G-Quadruplex Binding
Ligands (18)
The desired benzylamine derivative 1 (1.5 mmol), 4-aminoacetophenone (2r, 135.17
mg, 1.0 mmol), 4,6-dihydroxysalicylic acid (3, 8.5 mg,
0.05 mmol), and DMSO (0.1 mL) were added to a 50 mL round-bottom flask,
and then BF3·Et2O (12.5 μL, 0.1 mmol)
was added to the mixture. The reaction mixture was stirred at 100
°C for 18 h under air, then cooled to 60 °C. 4-Chlorobutyryl
chloride (2.0 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was stirred
overnight (>16 h) at 60 °C. The dark reaction mixture was
cooled
in an ice bath and basified to pH > 7 with a saturated NaHCO3 solution (35 mL). A dark oil appeared and was separated from
the
mixture by pouring out the water. The dark oil was collected and dissolved
in methanol (20 mL), concentrated by vacuum, and then pyrrolidine
(1.0 mL) was added to the residue. The resulting dark mixture was
stirred overnight (>16 h) at room temperature and cooled in an
ice
bath. Saturated NaHCO3 solution (35 mL) was then added,
and the mixture was stirred for 1 h. A gray solid appeared and was
collected by filtration. The filter cake was dissolved in methanol/chloroform
(30 mL, 1:4) and concentrated by vacuum. The residue was purified
by preparative thin-layer chromatography (eluent: chloroform/methanol/triethylamine
= 15/4/1) to give 18.
