Temperature’s
effects on rock permeability are ambiguous;
both positive and negative correlations have been reported in the
literature. Temperature can affect the geomechanical behavior of porous
media, as well as influence the mode of fluid transport. Rocks are
subject to deformation, compaction, and chemical alteration at elevated
temperatures. Conversely, confined fluids can undergo augmented non-Darcian
mechanisms. In this research, a multiscale, multiphysical study of
temperature’s effects on gas permeability in tight formations
is presented.

Introduction
Both positive and negative correlations
between rock permeability
and temperature have been reported in the literature.1−4 Increasing the temperature can increase the degree of rock compaction
and hence decrease the permeability.5 A
temperature rise may also cause chemical alteration of the minerals,
restricting the flow paths of fluids.6 The
mechanical integrity of rock is subject to change at high temperatures.
Geomechanical properties can be significantly influenced by temperature
variations of injected fluids during hydraulic fracturing.7 The major focus of the aforementioned studies
was the effects of temperature on rocks; exploration of how temperature
changes affect fluids being transported has been limited to analyses
of viscosity and thermal expansion. Recently, researchers pay attention
to the significance of coupling rock and fluid modeling of temperature’s
effects for a more accurate description of transport in porous media.8,9

Tight formations, classified as unconventional resources,
exhibit
non-Darcian transport mechanisms.10,11 Recent studies
have shown that such mechanisms can be augmented at elevated temperatures.12 Enhanced diffusion can counteract thermal loading,
indicating that the permeability of tight formations may either positively
or negatively correlate with temperature. The objective of the present
research is to couple the stress-related aspects of rocks with non-Darcian
transport mechanisms to better understand the temperature’s
effects on the permeability of tight formations through pore network
modeling.

Thermal Stress
In general, effective stress relates
the pore pressure of rocks
to applied stresses through Biot’s coefficient 1  where σe is
the effective stress, σa is the applied stress, PP is the pore pressure, and n is Biot’s poroelastic term, defined based on the bulk’s
modulus of a given rock.

At elevated temperatures, a thermal
stress component is added to
the above equation, following the Duhamel–Neumann approach13 2  where β is the thermal
stress coefficient. This is related to the thermal expansion coefficient aT, Young’s modulus E, and Poisson’s ratio υ, assuming a plane-strain deformation13 3  

Non-Darcian Transport
Temperature
reflects internal energy on a molecular level. As the
temperature increases, molecule-to-molecule and molecule-to-wall collisions
become more frequent. The average distance a molecule can travel before
colliding with another molecule, known as the mean free path l, is a parameter that has been used to address the likelihood
of deviation from continuum flow to transition and free molecular
diffusion regimes 4  

The mean free path l is proportional to T and inversely proportional
to the pressure P and molecular size dP2 through
Boltzmann’s constant kB. In the
case of ultratight rocks where pores are sized on micro- and nanoscales,
the mean free path of lighter molecules is of a magnitude close to
the pore size. Consequently, molecule-to-wall interactions become
significant and can govern the overall transport.

Knudsen’s
number Kn, which is the ratio of the mean free
path l to the pore size L, is used
to characterize the mode of transport 5  

A Knudsen’s number Kn greater than 0.01 indicates a deviation
from the continuum flow (i.e., Darcy’s law is insufficient
to describe the transport). The Knudsen’s number for ultratight
formations is expected to be relatively large and positively correlated
with temperature. Hence, the non-Darcian effects of tight formations
are more pronounced at higher temperatures.

This deviation from
Darcy’s law has been addressed in the
literature by introducing the apparent permeability. Klinkenberg (1941) presented a permeability model as 6  where kapp is the apparent permeability. This is related to intrinsic
permeability through the b factor, which has been
modeled to account for the slippage and Knudsen’s diffusion.14−17

The correction factor b in eq 6 can change with shifts in temperature
and
pressure. At reservoir conditions where linear and nonlinear thermal
gradients exist, the temperature’s effect on b can be significant. In the following section, the non-Darcian effect
and thermal stress are discussed on the pore-scale level.

Pore-Scale Combined
Transport Model
The transport equation for gas in single
nanocapillaries has frequently
been cited.18−20 In general, this approach is based on combining viscous
and transition regimes. A nonempirical transport equation for nanopores
that accounted for slippage and molecular diffusion effects is given
as15 7  where r is
the radius of the nanopore, PP is the
pore pressure, μ is the viscosity, and DKn is Knudsen’s diffusivity coefficient 8  

F is the nonslip factor introduced as21 9  where α is between 0
and 1 and related to the parts of molecules reflected diffusively
from the walls, similar to a mirror-like reflection.22

The transport described in the above equation is
an explicit function
of the pressure and pore radius. It is also a function of temperature
as Knudsen’s diffusivity coefficient DKn and the slip velocity factor F are temperature-dependent.

The permeability of nanotubes is related to their radii, as given
by the Hagen–Poiseuille relationship. Hence, the capillary
size r is subject to change through the exponential
relationship of the effective stress, including thermal loading (see eq 2)23 10  where cr is the compressibility of the pores, and r0 is the pore size at zero effective stress.

Pore Network
Modeling
Performing experimental work on rock samples at
varying temperatures
is quite challenging and associated with a high degree of uncertainty
due to heating/reheating hysteresis and the length of time it takes
to reach the thermal equilibrium.24 The
concept of “digital rocks” or pore network models (PNMs)
where pores are interconnected by throats provides an alternative
means of performing parametric analysis. Pores are where fluid is
stored, while throats or capillaries are the conduits for transport
among those pores. A 3D arrangement of a pore/throat system can serve
as a representation of a particular porous medium.25 Similar to a previous research study on this topic, mass
balance can be written for each pore as follows26 11  where the first term is the
sum of all fluxes entering the pore through n number
of capillaries, with the flow rate q usually given
by the classical Hagen–Poiseuille equation for cylindrical
geometry. In our case, transport in the throats is governed by eq 7 to account for the non-Darcian
transport mechanism. The second term of eq 11 indicates the accumulation of fluid inside
the pores. Discretization of the mass balance yields a set of nonlinear
equations that determine the total flow rate in the system.

Sensitivity
Analysis and Discussion
Temperature’s effects on gas
transport on a nanoscale were
studied across a range of pore sizes at relatively high and low pore
pressures. The analysis was carried out for single capillaries without
considering the thermal stress effect to investigate how temperature
changes can influence transport. Equation 7 was used to obtain the velocity for different
scenarios, with Darcian velocity serving as a reference. The results
are given in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Normalized methane velocities in single capillaries as a function
of temperature. Pore pressures were (above) 1500 psi and (below) 500
psi.

The velocity of methane positively
correlated with temperature.
Temperature was found to enhance the non-Darcian mechanisms that increase
the overall velocity. The effects of temperature were more pronounced
at lower pressures, where slippage and diffusion were dominant. As
the capillary sizes increased, transport became less dependent on
temperature, indicating the predominance of viscosity-driven transport.

The individual effects of slippage and Knudsen diffusion at elevated
temperatures are presented here as a Darcian velocity multiplier for
a single capillary with a size of 2 nm at 500 psi. The results given
in Figure 2 indicate
the temperature dependency of both mechanisms.

a function of temperature for a single capillary with a size of 2
nm at P = 500 psi.

Next, thermal stress was coupled with the transport model
to study
the net effect of temperature on the permeability of tight rocks.
In this stage, a pore network modeling approach involving pores interconnected
by throats was used to mimic rock samples. At each pore, the mass
balance given in eq 11 was solved with the flux determined by eq 7. The radius r of the capillary
was subject to change as a function of pressure and temperature, as
given by eq 10. Throats
and pores were sampled from predefined distributions to build a network
through which gas could be transported. The pressure gradient was
imposed by setting the value of the downstream to be lower than that
of the upstream. The apparent permeability value was obtained from
the flow rate, area, and pressure gradient. Detailed discretization
of eq 11 is given in
the Appendix, and a description of the model
appears in Figure 3.

Figure 3 Schematic of the pore network model used to represent the combined
effects of temperature-augmented transport and thermal stress.

The ratio of permeability at a
given temperature to permeability
at a reference temperature (i.e., ratio = kapp (T)/kapp (To)) was obtained for a range of pressure values and capillary
size distributions, as shown in Figures 4–6. In general, the Knudsen and slippage diffusions increase
with rising temperatures at a rate that depends on the pressure and
size of the capillary. At high pressures, the molecule-to-wall interactions
are insignificant compared to the molecule-to-molecule collisions,
a condition that hinders slippage and diffusion. Hence, increasing
the temperature favors thermal stress over non-Darcian effects, as
shown in Figure 4.
As the pressure decreases, the slippage and Knudsen’s diffusion
become more significant, positively impacting the apparent permeability
with the temperature increase (see Figures 5 and 6).

ratio (kapp/kapp,ref) at a pore pressure of 3000 psi.

Figure 5 Permeability ratio (kapp/kapp,ref) at a pore pressure
of 1000 psi.

Figure 6 Permeability ratio (kapp/kapp,ref) at
a pore pressure of 250 psi.

Conversely, capillary size negatively correlates with Knudsen’s
number. Larger capillaries exhibit viscous transport over slippage
and diffusion, which makes them more vulnerable to thermal stress
at elevated temperatures (Table 1).

Conclusions
Laboratory
measurements of petrophysical parameters such as permeability
are essential for optimum exploitation and reservoir management. The
permeability of ultratight rocks is an active subject of study because
of its dependency on pressure. In this research, it was shown that
the permeability of ultratight rocks also correlates with temperature.
This occurs through the two counteracting mechanisms of thermal stress
and enhanced diffusion. The prevalence of one mechanism over the other
is determined by pore pressure and the degree of confinement. A positive
correlation between gas permeability and temperature was observed
in the low to intermediate range of pressure in ultratight formations,
while a negative correlation is expected as the formations become
more permeable.
