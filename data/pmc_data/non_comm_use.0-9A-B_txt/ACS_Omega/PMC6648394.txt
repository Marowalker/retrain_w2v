Self-assembled
molecular monolayer (SAMM) doping on semiconductors
has been widely appraised for its advantages of doping nanoelectronic
devices for applications in the complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor
transistor (CMOS) industry. However, defects introduced by SAMM-doping
will limit the performance of the devices. Previously, we have found
that SAMM-doping can bring carbon impurities into the silicon substrate
and these unwanted carbon impurities can deactivate phosphorus dopants
by forming an interstitial carbon (Ci)–substitutional
phosphorus (Ci–Ps) complex. Herein, to
develop a defect-free SAMM-doping process, the generation and annihilation
of Ci-related defects are investigated by extending the
thermal annealing time from 2 to 10 min using secondary ion mass spectrometry
and deep-level transient spectroscopy. The results show that the concentration
of Ci-related carbon defects is lower after a longer time
of thermal annealing, although a longer annealing time actually introduces
a higher concentration of carbon impurities into Si. This observation
indicates that interstitial carbon evolves into substitutional carbon
(Cs) that is electrically inactive during the thermal annealing
process. A defect-free SAMM-doping process may be developed by an
appropriate post-annealing process.

Introduction
Doping
by self-assembled molecular monolayers (SAMMs) is a promising
alternative doping technique to conventional ion implantation, thanks
to its advantages of forming ultra-shallow junctions,1 introducing no structural damage to semiconductors,2,3 deterministic positioning of dopants,4 and conformal doping on 3-D surfaces.5,6 For SAMM-doping,
dopants are first introduced onto the semiconductor surface via covalent
immobilization of dopant-carrying organic molecules and then driven
into bulk by high-temperature thermal annealing. However, carbon in
the dopant-carrying molecules will co-diffuse into the semiconductor
substrate and electrically deactivate the dopants. For example, in
our recent report, at least 20% of phosphorus atoms were deactivated
by forming interstitial carbon–substitutional phosphorus (Ci–Ps) defects.7 Duffy et al. also reported8 that Si nanowires
doped by the SAMM process have a lower dopant activation rate when
compared to the devices doped with the standard ion implantation,
likely because of the carbon-related defects introduced by the dopant
carrier molecules. Hence, it is extremely important to develop a defect-free
SAMM-doping technique, in particular for commercial applications in
the state-of-the-art fin field-effect transistors.2,5

Several approaches have been explored to suppress carbon contamination
by either eliminating the carbon content in SAMM or stopping its diffusion
into the silicon substrate with a SiO2 blocking layer or
a low-temperature carbon-releasing mechanism. Alphazan et al.9 and Ye et al.10 synthesized
low-carbon-containing organic molecules such as silanols and carboranes
as a dopant-containing carrier to reduce carbon contamination. Van
Druenen et al.11 used an ultrathin layer
of SiO2 to stop the diffusion of carbon into the silicon
bulk. Longo et al.12,13 proposed to minimize the unintentional
carbon incorporation by breaking the chemical bonds and releasing
carbon at a lower temperature than that of annealing. However, no
electrical evidence of defect reduction or zero-defect in SAMM-doping
was given in these approaches.

It has been found that the behavior
of carbon diffusion in SAMM-doped
silicon is more complex than expected.14−16 Although carbon has
a much larger diffusivity than phosphorus, it was found to be limited
to the first 2–3 nm from the surface when a spike annealing
process is applied.14 Kántor et
al.17 showed that surface carbon introduced
by ion implantation propagated toward the silicon bulk and would stabilize
at substitutional lattice sites during repeated thermal cycles of
laser annealing. Libertino et al.18 investigated
the interstitial- and vacancy-type defects in silicon and found that
defects would evolve upon thermal annealing. These two works suggest
that carbon-related defects in SAMM-doped samples may be modulated
by thermal annealing. In this work, we extended the thermal annealing
time for the SAMM-doped silicon samples from 2 to 10 min and investigated
the evolution of carbon-related defects. The results indicate that
interstitial carbon evolves into substitutional carbon as this species
diffuses into the bulk at a high temperature, leading to the suppression
of Ci-related defects. It implies interestingly that a
defect-free SAMM-doping process may be achieved by an appropriate
post-annealing process.

Results and Discussion
Dodecyl phosphate
molecules were grafted via covalent bonds onto
a hydrofluoric acid (HF)-treated intrinsic silicon (100) wafer (resistivity
> 10 kΩ·cm) in an oxygen-free and moisture-free Ar atmosphere
(Figure S1). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) were employed to examine the
dodecyl phosphate-modified silicon surface, as shown in Figures 1, S2, and S3. A high-resolution narrow scan of C 1s (Figure 1a) reveals three peaks at 284.7,
286.8, and 289.2 eV, which are attributed to carbons in the forms
of aliphatic carbon (C–C), carbon bonded with oxygen or carbon
adjacent to carbonyl (C–O/C(C=O)),
and carbon in carbonyl (C=O), respectively. The integral area
ratio of the three peaks is 22:3.5:1, which is close to the stoichiometric
ratio of 21:4:1 in the molecular monolayer shown in Figure S1. P 2s narrow scans were performed by ARXPS at different
takeoff angles, as shown in Figures 1b and S3. The peak at 191.4
eV is ascribed to P 2s from the dodecyl phosphate monolayers. It is
normally buried in the strong and broad envelope of Si 2s plasmon
loss when the incident X-ray is perpendicular to the sample surface
(90°). As the takeoff angle decreases, the Si 2s plasmon loss
is suppressed and the P 2s peak stands out, which is consistent with
the observations of the P-containing molecular monolayer in literature.19,20

narrow scan of C 1s with a takeoff angle of 90°. (b) P 2s narrow
scans with takeoff angles of 90°, 60°, and 30°. For
comparison, XPS spectra at 60° and 30° are magnified to
1.6 times and 5 times, respectively.

After the grafting of the dodecyl phosphate monolayers, the
P-functionalized
silicon samples were first coated with a 200 nm thick SiO2 formed by spin-on-glass and then annealed at 1050 °C for 2
and 10 min, separately. A control sample (intrinsic Si substrate)
was prepared in the same manner but with a P-free molecule. Van der
Pauw measurements were carried out in darkness on the control sample
and the SAMM-doped intrinsic silicon substrates. As shown in Table S1, the sheet resistance of the blank sample
is 309 kΩ/□, consistent with the nominal resistivity
of >10 kΩ·cm. The sheet resistance of the control sample
drops slightly to 243 kΩ/□, indicating that our SAMM-doping
system is clean and introduces no unintentional impurities. After
the SAMM-doping, the sheet resistances of the samples sharply drop
to 5.6 and 1.7 kΩ/□ for the 2-min and 10-min annealing,
respectively. It demonstrates that P dopants successfully diffuse
into and dope the silicon substrate with an increasing electrical
activity with the increase of the annealing time.

To characterize
the defects introduced by SAMM-doping, Schottky
diodes were fabricated on the SAMM-doped silicon samples for deep-level
transient spectroscopy (DLTS) measurements. However, the depletion
region will be as wide as micrometers if we use the intrinsic silicon
substrate, as a result of which the DLTS measurements will probe defects
in the substrate bulk instead of the SAMM-doping region near the surface.
For this reason, we chose an n-type Si substrate with a doping concentration
of ∼1.8 × 1015 cm–3 (resistivity
of ∼3.2 Ω·cm). In our previous work,7 we found that carbon can bind with phosphorus, forming
Ci–Ps defects. In this work, to avoid
the possible interference of phosphorus dopants from the substrate,
we choose the As-doped silicon wafer as the substrate for the defect
investigation. Two sets of P-modified n-type silicon samples were
annealed at 1050 °C for 2 and 10 min, which were referred to
as the 2-min sample and 10-min sample, respectively. As shown in Figure S5a, a circular gold electrode (200 nm
thick) with a diameter of 1 mm was made on the front surface of the
silicon samples by photolithography and thermal evaporation. A 100
nm thick Al film was deposited on the backside of the silicon samples
after extensive scratches by a diamond scribe to form Ohmic contact.
The current–voltage (I–V) curves of the Schottky diodes on the blank sample and SAMM-doped
samples are shown in Figure 2a. The leakage current of the blank sample at −2 V
is 30 nA, whereas the leakage currents for the 2-min sample and 10-min
sample at the same bias are 50 and 400 μA, respectively. The
significantly increased leakage currents are likely due to the higher
doping concentration that reduces the potential barrier height of
the Schottky junction (see the doping profiles in Figures 4a and 5a).21,22

diodes on the blank sample, 2-min sample, and 10-min sample. The I–V and C–V measurements were performed in dark at room temperature.

20 s–1) of the blank sample, 2-min sample, and 10-min
sample.

Capacitance–voltage (C–V) measurements were conducted
on these samples at 1 MHz at room temperature
with the dc bias ranging from −2 to 0.2 V, as shown in Figure 2b. The capacitance
is larger for the 10-min sample, because a longer annealing time will
lead to a higher doping concentration and hence a narrower depletion
region in the semiconductor. For the blank sample, the background
doping is uniform. A built-in potential of ∼0.5 V can be extracted
by extending the linear curve of 1/C2 versus
voltage to the point (1/C2 = 0) in Figure 2c. For the SAMM-doped
samples, the dependency of 1/C2 on voltage
becomes nonlinear, in particular when approaching a positive bias.
This is caused by the highly nonuniform distribution of dopants and
defects introduced by the SAMM-doping process. As a result, the built-in
potential for these SAMM-doped samples cannot be extracted properly.
The ionized charge profiles can be derived from the C–V curves as shown in Figure S5, from which the background doping concentration
(As) of the samples is ∼1.8 × 1015 cm–3, consistent with the nominal resistivity (∼3.2 Ω·cm)
of the as-purchased wafers. For the SAMM-doped samples, the P dopants
diffuse into the Si substrate up to a depth of ∼340 and ∼500
nm for the 2-min and 10-min samples, respectively.

DLTS measurements
were performed on the blank, 2-min, and 10-min
samples at a rate window of 20 s–1 with the reverse-bias
voltage of −2 V and the pulse voltage of 0.2 V (hereafter an
applied pulse is written as “bias voltage”–“pulse
voltage”; e.g. −2 to 0.2 V). The results are shown in Figure 2d. For the blank
sample, the DLTS spectrum (black curve) remains nearly zero in the
whole temperature range, indicating that no detectable defects exist
in the As-doped silicon substrate. For the 2-min sample (red curve),
a broad bump from 100 to 300 K was observed in addition to a small
isolated peak at 86 K, similar to our previous results for the n-type
(P-doped) Si substrate that was SAMM-doped and measured at the same
condition.7 Surprisingly, for the 10-min
sample, the broad bump almost completely disappears except for the
peak at ∼270 K and the small isolated peak at ∼85 K,
indicating that a long annealing time helps suppress carbon-related
defects. A careful look indicates that the peak at ∼270 K in
the 10-min sample also shows up in the 2-min sample (the peak E2 at
the right edge in Figure 3a).

Arrhenius plots. (a) DLTS spectra and (b) Arrhenius plot on the 2-min
sample with a bias pulse of −2 to 0.2 V. (c) DLTS spectra and
(d) Arrhenius plot on the 10-min sample with a bias pulse of −2
to 0.2 V.

DLTS spectra at different rate
windows were measured to calculate
the energy levels of the peaks. The DLTS spectra on the 2-min sample
with a bias pulse of −2 to 0.2 V are shown in Figure 3a. As we know, the logarithm
term ln(en/T2) is linearly correlated to 1/(kT) in
which en is the emission
rate (equal to the rate window), k the Boltzmann
constant, and T the absolute temperature. The Arrhenius
plot is shown in Figure 3b with the peak positions (T) and corresponding
emission rates found from Figure 3a. The isolated peak ranging from 78 to 90 K corresponds
to an energy level of 0.152 eV below the conduction band minimum,
which is ascribed to the substitutional carbon bonded with hydrogen
(CsH).23 It is known that substitutional
carbon atoms are electrically inactive,24 but lead to active metastable defects after bonding with H from
the wet chemical process.25,26 DLTS simulations (Figure S7) and our previous results indicate
that the broad bump consists of multiple peaks coming from multiconfigurational
Ci–Ps defects and possibly multiconfigurational
Ci–Ass defects. For simplicity, we label
these multiconfigurational defects as Ci–Ds (interstitial carbons bond with substitutional group V donors. Ds represents Ps or Ass). The peak at
the right edge of the broad bump (ranging from ∼260 to 295
K) corresponds to the energy level of 0.545 eV below the conduction
band edge, which was not observed in our previous n-type (phosphorus)
Si substrate.7 As the background dopants
of the Si substrate in this work are arsenic, it is reasonable to
attribute this peak to Ci–Ass defects.

In the 10-min sample (at the same bias pulse of −2 to 0.2
V), the broad bump for the multiconfigurational Ci–Ds defects unexpectedly disappears except for the peak from
256 to 296 K and the isolated peak below 100 K, as shown in Figure 3c. The Arrhenius
plot (Figure 3d) indicates
that these two peaks correspond to the energy level of 0.541 and 0.147
eV below the conduction band edge, respectively. The defect level
of 0.147 eV is ascribed to CsH and 0.541 eV to Ci–Ds (Ds is Ass here), both
showing up in the 2-min sample (Figure 3a,b). What is more surprising, when the pulse voltage
is reduced from −2 to 0.2 to −2 to −0.5 V, all
the Ci–Ds peaks disappear, leaving only
the CsH-related peak (0.155 eV) in the spectrum (see Figure S8c,d). In contrast, the broad bump for
the multiconfigurational Ci–Ds defects,
although smaller, is still visible for the 2-min sample when the pulse
voltage is reduced from −2 to 0.2 to −2 to −0.5
V (Figure S8a,b).

To understand these
intriguing observations, we need to analyze
the distribution of carbon and phosphorus by secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) and the impurity concentration in the region that DLTS is probing.
For the 2-min sample in Figure 4a, the carbon concentration
starts from ∼1.3 × 1019 cm–3 at the surface and dramatically decreases by nearly 2 orders of
magnitude within the first 20 nm, followed by another order of magnitude
decline in the next 400 nm. The P concentration is ∼3 ×
1018 cm–3 at the surface and drops exponentially
(linearly in log scale) to the detection limit of 3.5 × 1015 cm–3 within the first 165 nm thick layer
below the surface. In contact with gold, the SAMM-doping layer near
the surface is depleted, forming a Schottky junction. The depletion
region edge is defined as the location where the electron concentration
is a tenth of the maximum electron concentration in the bulk (see Figure S9). The energy band diagram and electron
concentration are calculated using the Silvaco Atlas device simulator
(Supporting Information note 5). The energy
band diagram at the bias voltage of −2 V at 300 K is shown
in Figure 4b. As the
bias voltage is pulsed to 0.2 V, the depletion edge moves from ∼1050
to 18 nm (gray area in Figure 4b) below the surface in which carbon and phosphorus impurities
range from ∼1015 cm–3 (at 1048
nm) to ∼1018 cm–3 (at 18 nm).
In Figure 4c, the DLTS
spectrum indicates that there is a high concentration of CsH and Ci–Ds defects in this probing
region (gray area). When the pulse sequence of −2 to −0.5
V is applied, the DLTS probing region is shifted away from the surface
(∼1050 to ∼162 nm) as shown in Figure 4d. No defects are detected except for a small
concentration of the multiconfigurational Ci–Ds defects (Figure 4e), which are most likely Ci–Ass defects as P dopants have not diffused deeper than 160 nm below
the surface. Clearly, the Ci-related defects are mainly
located in the thin layer near the surface where the carbon and phosphorus
concentration introduced by the SAMM-doping are relatively high (1018 to 1017 cm–3).

with a pulse voltage of 0.2 V. The green curve represents the applied
pulse of −2 to 0.2 V. The corresponding DLTS spectrum at a
rate window of 5 s–1 is shown in (c). (d) Silvaco
simulation on the band structure with a bias voltage of −2

voltage of −0.5 V. The green curve represents the applied pulse
of −2 to −0.5 V. The corresponding DLTS spectrum at
a rate window of 5 s–1 is shown in (e).

For the 10-min sample, the carbon concentration
is ∼1 ×
1019 cm–3 at the surface and decreases
by an order of magnitude with the first ∼20 nm and by another
order of magnitude within the next ∼50 nm. It then ends up
with a long tail deep into the substrate (>1017 cm–3 at 500 nm). The P concentration decreases from ∼2.6
× 1018 cm–3 at the surface by 1
order of magnitude within the first 20 nm, followed by another order
of magnitude decline for the next 250 nm, as shown in Figure 5a. When the bias pulse of −2 to 0.2 V is applied, the
DLTS probes the region from ∼171 to ∼36 nm (gray area
in Figure 5b). In this
region, although the carbon and phosphorus impurities are as high
as 2–4 × 1017 cm–3 at 36
nm below the surface, only a small number of CsH and Ci–Ds defects are detected (Figure 5c). When the pulse voltage
is reduced to −2 to −0.5 V, the DLTS is probing a region
further away from the surface (∼171 to ∼77 nm below
the surface shown as the gray area in Figure 5d). In this region, the carbon and phosphorus
impurities still remain above 1017 cm–3, but all Ci–Ds defects disappear (Figure 5e), leaving only
a relatively high concentration of CsH defects. The observation
of CsH defects deep in the Si bulk can be explained by
the metastability of the CsH defects. It was reported that
the CsH defects are highly correlated with moderate heat
treatment26 during thermal evaporation,
light radiation27 during diode fabrication,
and applied voltages during measurements28 (Figure S6); therefore, quantitative
analysis on the peak amplitude of CsH will not be conclusive
in the current measurement condition.

Generally, carbon atoms in silicon
tend to substitute silicon atoms
(Si–C) after high-temperature annealing, forming electrically
inactive carbon impurities. However, in both the 2-min sample and
the 10-min sample carbon reaches a concentration of 1 × 1019 cm–3, which is much higher than the solubility
limit of carbon in silicon.29 Carbon atoms
with an extraordinarily high concentration will aggregate near the
surface, generating interstitial carbon to release the interface energy
between Si and Si–C.30 This explains
a high concentration of Ci-related defects detected in
the 2-min sample. For a longer annealing time, carbon near the surface
diffuses deeper into the bulk, dissolving the carbon aggregation near
the surface and increasing the carbon concentration in the bulk as
shown by the SIMS data for the 10-min sample. The interstitial carbon
defects do not increase but in fact decrease because the interstitial
carbon evolves into substitutional carbon during the thermal diffusion
process. As it is a source-limit diffusion process, a sufficiently
long diffusion time will eventually lead to a defect-free SAMM-doping
process with a relatively thick doping depth.

However, it will
be difficult to form ultra-shallow junctions at
a long annealing time and a high temperature. Fortunately, it was
previously shown18 that interstitial carbon-related
defects can be suppressed by thermal treatment at 400 °C and
that Ci–Ds defects can be modulated by
moderate thermal treatment,31,32 like our in situ thermal
treatment during DLTS measurements (see Supporting Information note 6). Therefore, it is possible to develop defect-free
ultra-shallow junctions via high-temperature spike annealing followed
by a long-time moderate thermal treatment that has little impact on
the dopant distribution profile.

In conclusion, we have compared
the defect profiles of SAMM-doped
samples with 2-min and 10-min annealing and found that the variation
of Ci-related defects is related to the behavior of carbon
contamination in silicon and a longer annealing time causes a dramatic
decrease in Ci–Ds. In DLTS spectra of
the 2-min sample, a wide bump representing Ci–Ds was detected with Ci generated from the carbon
aggregation near the silicon surface. However, in DLTS spectra of
the 10-min sample, although more carbon and phosphorus diffused into
silicon, Ci–Ds defects were effectively
suppressed. This is because the Ci source of carbon aggregation
dissolved into the silicon bulk and turned into substitutional carbon
during a longer thermal annealing. Defect-free SAMM-doping may be
developed when an appropriate post thermal annealing is applied.

Experimental
Sections
Materials
Float zone n-type Si(100) (arsenic as dopants
and resistivity of ∼3.2 Ω·cm) and intrinsic Si(100)
(resistivity > 10 kΩ·cm) were applied for DLTS measurements
and van der Pauw measurements, respectively. Deionized (DI) water
> 18.2 MΩ was generated by a Milli-Q system. CMOS-grade ethanol,
dichloromethane, and acetone were applied for rinsing P-functionalized
silicon samples. 5-Hexenyl acetate (98%) was purchased from TCI, Shanghai.
Dodecyl phosphate (97%) was from Alfa Aesar. Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide
(DCC, 99%), lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4 powder, reagent
grade, 95%), anhydrous p-xylene (1,4-dimethylbenzene),
and dimethylformamide (DMF) were from Sigma-Aldrich. HF (48%, CMOS-grade)
and ammonium fluoride (NH4F, 40%, CMOS grade) were from
China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation. 99.999% Au and 99.99%
Al beads are applied as the evaporation source.

Wafer Cleaning
Float zone n-type Si(100) and intrinsic
Si(100) were cut into 1.5 × 1.5 cm2 pieces and cleaned
with CMOS-grade acetone under sonication for 15 min. After rinsing
with CMOS-grade ethanol and DI water, the Si chips were immersed in
“piranha solution” [98% H2SO4/30%
H2O2, 3:1 (v/v)] at 90 °C for 30 min, to
remove organic contaminants. Subsequently, the samples were rinsed
with plenty of DI water and dried with nitrogen. The wafers were then
etched in 5% HF solution for 2 min to remove the oxide layer and render
a hydrogen-terminated surface. The hydrogen-terminated Si chips were
quickly rinsed with DI water, blown dry with nitrogen, and immediately
proceeded for the SAMM-grafting process.

Self-Assembly of the Molecular
Monolayer
The freshly
HF-etched silicon chips were sealed into a reaction tube with a sidearm,
which was connected to a dual manifold Schlenk line and filled with
dried 99.999% Ar. Subsequently, deoxygenated 5-hexenyl acetate was
injected into the reaction tube covering the silicon samples. The
self-assembly of 5-hexenyl acetate was then conducted at 145 °C
for 5 h. After cooling down naturally, the samples were copiously
rinsed with CMOS-grade ethanol, dichloromethane, acetone, and DI water,
to remove physical absorption and leave only a molecular monolayer
of 5-hexenyl acetate.

The samples were blow-dried by N2. Then, the distal acetate groups of the resulting molecular monolayer
on the silicon surface were reduced by lithium aluminum hydride (LiAlH4) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) at 70 °C for 2 h, yielding
a hydroxyl-terminated silicon surface. After cooling down naturally,
the samples were copiously rinsed with anhydrous THF, CMOS-grade ethanol,
dichloromethane, acetone, and DI water, and then blow-dried by N2.

After reduction by THF, hydroxyl-terminated Si samples
reacted
with monododecyl phosphate in DMF at room temperature in the presence
of the cross-linker DCC. Finally, the P-functionalized silicon was
excessively rinsed with CMOS-grade ethanol, dichloromethane, acetone,
and DI water to remove physically adsorbed monododecyl phosphate,
the coupling agent DCC, and the solvent. A control sample goes through
the same self-assembly process except that monododecyl phosphate was
not added in the DMF.

XPS Measurement
XPS measurements
were carried on a
Kratos AXIS UltraDLD spectrometer with a monochromated Al Kα
source (1486.6 eV). During measurements, the chamber pressure was
below 5 × 10–9 Torr. Survey scans were carried
out selecting a 1 eV step size and an analyzer pass energy of 160
eV. High-resolution scans were run with a 0.1 eV step size and the
analyzer pass energy set to 40 eV. XPS spectra were fitted using Casa
XPS software. First, XPS spectra were calibrated with the binding
energy of aliphatic carbon (carbon bonded with carbon) to be 284.8
eV. Subsequently, the background was subtracted using the Shirley
routine. Then, convolutions of Lorentzian and Gaussian functions are
applied to fit peaks.

Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry
The carbon and phosphorus
depth profiles were conducted at EAG laboratories in NJ, USA, under
a high-vacuum condition of about 3 × 10–11 Torr.
A focused Cs+ primary ion beam was applied to facilitate
high yields of secondary ions of phosphorus and carbon. Before carbon
depth profiling, the samples were cleaned with oxygen plasma to remove
possible carbon contamination from the ambient.
