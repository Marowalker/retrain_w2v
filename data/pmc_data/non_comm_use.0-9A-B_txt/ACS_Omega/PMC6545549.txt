In recent years,
the increase in demand for fumaric acid from industry has resulted
in an increased need for a high-selectivity process for the conversion
of maleic acid to fumaric acid. A highly selective conversion of fumaric
acid was achieved without a catalyst by a simple one-step hydrothermal
reaction. In addition, the competitive conversion of maleic acid,
fumaric acid, and malic acid was first systematically investigated
in detail without using a catalyst. The products were characterized
by X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared, which demonstrated
that the product was fumaric acid. The highly selective conversion
of fumaric acid was achieved, and the yield of fumaric acid could
reach 92%. Furthermore, a reaction kinetic model was put forward to
study the competitive transformation process. The kinetic model predictions
were found to agree well with the experimental data. The kinetic parameters
were used to explain the changes in the content of every substance
at different reaction temperatures and reaction times. In addition,
the initial maleic acid concentration in the reaction was also considered
as an influencing factor. These results can facilitate the conditional
control and product control of industrial processes for the production
of fumaric acid or malic acid using latter without a catalyst.

==== Body
Introduction
Fumaric acid, a tetra-carbon unsaturated
dicarboxylic acid classified as an organic acid, is widely distributed
in nature. In 2004, fumaric acid was listed as the most promising
building block derived from biomass by Werpy and Petersen due to its
excellent performance.1,2 Fumaric acid has traditionally
been used in the production of food acidity regulators,1 feed preservatives,3−5 and other high-potency chemical products.6−8 Recently, fumaric acid has been
applied in metal–organic frameworks,9,10 polymer
composites,11,12 composite anodes of high-energy
lithium batteries,13 co-crystals,14,15 and microenvironment tablets.16 Thus,
the demand for fumaric acid has dramatically increased with the expansion
of the application scope for fumaric acid, which has made it necessary
to study effective fumaric acid production methods.

Currently,
methods for preparing fumaric acid mainly include chemical isomerization
and biosynthesis.17,18 Chemical synthesis methods for
fumaric acid were investigated in the 1940s and laid the foundation
for the industrial production of fumaric acid.19 With the continuous development of biotechnology and the
rapid growth of fossil (petroleum) based chemical production costs,
investigations on the preparation of fumaric acid by biosynthetic
methods have become more popular. Rhizopus,20−23Torulopsis glabrata,24 Filamentous fungal strains,25−27Saccharomyces cerevisiae,28,29Escherichia coli,30,31 and
other significant microorganisms32 have
been applied to produce fumaric acid. In addition, some new biotechnologies,
such as alkali pretreatment,33 microwave
technology,34 immobilization technology,26,35 and biorefinery technology,36 have been
developed to improve the yield of fumaric acid. Nevertheless, biosynthesis
methods have suffered from the inherent disadvantages of low yield
and efficiency and a long cycle in the process of production. Thus,
researchers have tried to develop isomerization methods to improve
the synthesis efficiency. Several noteworthy catalysts have been reported
to enhance the reaction conditions and increase the productivity of
fumaric acid, including bromate ion,37,38 vanadium pentoxide,39 hydrochloric acid,40 and poly(4-vinyl pyridine).41 In a further
study, researchers have introduced microwaves to reduce the reaction
time of maleic acid and malic acid for assisted synthesis.42 By using the chemical isomerization method,
the yield of fumaric acid can reach over 80%, which is far higher
than that realized by using a biosynthesis method.

To further
study the chemical isomerization method of fumaric acid synthesis,
more researchers have used kinetic methods to explore the mutual transformation
between fumaric acid and other acids under certain conditions. For
example, Wojcieszak et al.43 and Delhomme
et al.44 discussed the feasibility of and
conditions for the mutual conversion of maleic anhydride, maleic acid,
fumaric acid, and malic acid. Wang et al.40 successfully converted maleic acid and fumaric acid into malic acid
in an acidic aqueous solution at 120 °C. Ortiz et al.42 studied the kinetics of the transformation from
fumaric acid to maleic acid and malic acid at four different temperatures
in a homogeneous nonisothermal batch reactor by using hydrochloric
acid as a catalyst. The reason for and processes of the reaction could
be explained by the reaction kinetics, so it was very meaningful to
introduce kinetic studies into the related reaction processes. Our
previous work has demonstrated that the isomerization of maleic acid
can produce fumaric acid in the absence of a catalyst.45 Nevertheless, no detailed kinetic studies have
been reported in the available literature about the mutual conversion
of malic acid, maleic acid, and fumaric acid, especially the isomerization
of maleic acid to fumaric acid, although such a kinetic study is significant,
regardless of the use of a catalyst.

Researchers have proposed
many kinetic models that help to study the conversion process between
maleic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid. Rozelle et al.46 studied the hydration kinetic and thermodynamic
models of fumaric acid in a concentrated hydrochloric acid solution
at 125–200 °C, but they only explored the mutual conversion
process between fumaric acid and malic acid under the condition of
hydrochloric acid catalysis. In addition, Jwo et al.47 investigated the kinetics of the conversion of maleic acid
to fumaric acid under the action of bromine and strontium ions, while
the model mainly focused on the one-way conversion of maleic acid
to fumaric acid with a catalyst. Furthermore, Ortiz et al.48,49 converted a low concentration of fumaric acid to maleic acid and
malic acid under the action of hydrochloric acid or no catalysts.
This study only carried out the conversion reaction of fumaric acid
rather than that of maleic acid. However, kinetic studies on the production
of fumaric acid and malic acid using maleic acid, especially in the
absence of a catalyst, have not been conducted. In addition, previous
theoretical studies are not fully applicable to this process.

In this study, the selectivity of fumaric acid in the mutual conversion
of fumaric acid, maleic acid, and malic acid was enhanced by conditional
control in the absence of a catalyst, and a more comprehensive model
of the reaction kinetics was established to explain the reaction process
for the first time. In previous studies on the mutual conversion of
fumaric acid, maleic acid, and malic acid, the strong selectivity
of specific acids, especially fumaric acid, has not been studied on
the basis of strengthening the investigation of the experimental influencing
factors and determining better reaction conditions. In addition, the
reaction mechanism of the selective production of fumaric acid and
the mechanism of competition between various substances were also
analyzed. It should be noted that to obtain a higher yield of fumaric
acid in a short time, the mutual conversion between fumaric acid,
maleic acid, and malic acid was fully considered. In addition, the
content of each substance in the reaction was detected by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC), and the relevant kinetic parameters
were calculated. The kinetic parameters explained the reasons for
the change in the selectivity of each substance in the reaction as
a result of various influencing factors and provided guidance for
the subsequent control of conditions for the production of fumaric
acid and malic acid without a catalyst.

Experimental Section
Materials
All chemicals were guaranteed reagents and used without further purification.
The raw material (maleic acid) was an analytical reagent purchased
from China Commeo Chemical Co., Ltd. Distilled water was used in the
isomerization and purification stages. For the analysis and testing
phases, fumaric acid (analytical reagent), maleic acid (analytical
reagent), malic acid (biological grade), and hydrochloric acid (analytical
reagent) were purchased from China Commeo Chemical Co., Ltd.

Preparation of Samples
The experiments
were performed in a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. Maleic acid and
distilled water were added to the inner liner and stirred to achieve
a uniform solution. Then, the Teflon-lined autoclave was sealed and
placed in a blast drying oven. Once the temperature of the mixture
reached the preset temperature, the timing was started. After heating
for a preset time, the products were cooled to room temperature and
removed. The experiments were carried out at 190, 200, 210, and 220
°C for 0–4 h. The initial reaction concentration of maleic
acid (mass fraction 35–100%) on the selectivity of fumaric
acid was also examined. The reaction experiments were repeated twice.

After adding a certain amount of distilled water, the reaction
mixture was stirred and washed for 1 h. Further, insoluble matter
and the washing solution were separated by suction filtration, and
the filter cake was dried for 2 h by a blast drying oven at 100 °C
to obtain the filtered product. The washing solution was prepared
for HPLC.

Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were measured on a TENSOR27
Fourier infrared spectrometer (Brook Spectrometer, Germany). The dried
samples were characterized by the potassium bromide tableting method,
and the spectra were recorded between 400 and 4000 cm–1.

The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the samples were
detected by an XRD-6100 (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan), with graphite
monochromated Cu Kα (λ = 1.54178 Å) radiation operating
at 40 kV and 30 mA in the angular range of 2θ = 5–80°
at room temperature. The scanning speed and the scanning step size
were 7° min–1 and 0.02°, respectively.
The sample needed to be dried, ground, and placed in a fixed mold
for compaction before testing.

Quantitative
Analysis of Samples
All samples were analyzed by HPLC (Agilent
Technologies 1260, Inc.). The column used was a Kromasil C18 column
(5 μm × 250 mm × 4.6 mm, Japan). The mobile phase
was an HCl solution in ultrapure water (pH 2) at a flow rate of 1
mL min–1 and an injection volume of 5 μL.
The sample detection wavelength was 210 nm, and the column temperature
was 42 ± 0.8 °C. The water samples were diluted 100 times
before testing. The dilute samples were analyzed by HPLC to determine
the content of each component, providing the necessary parameters
for the kinetic analyses.

The conversion rates of fumaric acid,
malic acid, and maleic acid were calculated by the following equations 1   2   3  where CMx0 (mol L–1) is the initial
concentration of maleic
acid and CF, CM, and CMx (mol L–1)
are the concentrations of maleic acid and fumaric acid at time t in the respective solutions. nMx0 (mol) is the initial molar mass of maleic acid and nF, nM, and nMx (mol) are the molar masses of maleic acid and fumaric
acid.

Reaction Kinetic Model
The reaction model in Figure 1 was established to study the kinetics of this series of isomerization
reactions and hydration reactions, which can explain the mutual transformation
between fumaric acid, malic acid, and maleic acid. In this context,
Mx, F, and M represent maleic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid,
respectively.

Figure 1 Simplified reaction model for the isomerization
and hydration of maleic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid.

According to the model with the assumption of
a first-order reaction, the following set of eqs 4–6 was obtained. 4   5   6  The following two boundary conditions
could be determined by the analyses of the experimental process. 7  It is worth noting that the reaction involving malic acid was a pseudo-first-order
reaction because water was present in large amounts during the reaction.
Although water was involved in some reactions, the amount of water
in the system was considered to be constant, and the progress of every
reaction was only related to the concentrations of fumaric acid, maleic
acid, and malic acid.

The kinetic experiments were carried out
using a maleic acid solution having a mass fraction of 60% (12.94
mol/L). Maleic acid has a higher solubility in water (100 °C,
solubility of 392.6/100 g water, 33.84 mol/L) and a higher solubility
at high temperatures, much higher than the concentration used in the
kinetic experiments.50 At the same time,
Ortiz et al.48 confirmed that the solubility
of fumaric acid increased exponentially with increasing temperature
(4.84 mol/L at 189 °C). Therefore, it can be considered that
the detected reaction is carried out under homogeneous conditions.

The effect of temperature on the reaction rate constant was calculated
by the Arrhenius equation, and the activation energy for the reaction
was determined 8  where T (K) is the absolute temperature, k (h–1) is the reaction rate constant
at the preset temperature, Ea (kJ mol–1) is the activation energy, R (8.314
J (mol K)−1) is the general gas constant, and A (h–1) is a pre-exponential factor. Ea was estimated based on linear regression analysis
of a plot of ln(ki) and
1/Ti (i = 190, 200, 210, and 220 °C).

The Gibbs free energy of
every reaction was calculated by using the following equation 9   10  where ΔG (J mol–1) is the Gibbs free energy at
the preset temperature, Kj (j = 1, 2, 3) is the reaction equilibrium constant,
and ki (i = 1, 2, 3) is the reaction rate constant (h–1)
for each reaction.

Results and
Discussion
Characterization of Products
The products were identified from the measured XRD pattern (Figure 2a). The diffraction
pattern showed six major diffraction peaks at 2θ = 18.4, 22.8,
28.7, 29.4, 31.2, and 35.8°. Compared with the peaks in the pattern
of fumaric acid standard and fumaric acid reported in the references,51 the peaks in the XRD pattern of the products
were consistent. This could indicate that the products had the same
crystal structure as fumaric acid and could be preliminarily identified
as fumaric acid. Since there were no other peaks present in the pattern,
the purity of the products was relatively high.

patterns of the
products, standard samples, and other research products.51 (b) FT-IR spectra of the products, standard
samples, and other research products.

FT-IR analysis
was further carried out to determine the structure of the product.
As shown in Figure 2b, the characteristic peak at 3081 cm–1 can be
assigned to the stretching vibration of C=C–H, while
the peaks at 2863 and 1670 cm–1 can be ascribed
to the stretching vibrations of saturated C–H and C=O,
respectively. The peak at 1424 cm–1 was caused by
the in-plane bending vibration of the saturated C–H. The three
peaks at approximately 1276 cm–1 resulted from the
stretching vibration of C–O. The peaks at 922 and 643 cm–1 were attributed to the out-of-plane bending vibration
of O–H and the deformation vibration of O=C–O,
respectively. Further, the single peak at 1008 cm–1 was attributed to the trans-substituted characteristic peak. The
FT-IR analysis further indicated that the product was fumaric acid,
which was in accordance with the XRD result.

Kinetic Study
To determine the rate-limiting step of
the isomerization reaction, the following concentration equations
were obtained by analyzing the above differential equation system
(4–6) 11   12   13  where 14   15   16   17   18  and 19  where ki (i = 1, 2, 3, −1, −3)
(h–1) was the reaction rate constant for each reaction
stage.

The content of each substance was determined by HPLC,
and these concentration equations were used to determine the rate
constant under each condition. The Solver function in Microsoft Excel
was used to find the best values for the reaction rate constants.
Using the Arrhenius form for the rate equations, the activation energy
(Ea) and pre-exponential factor (A) were calculated for each individual reaction temperature
using the slope and intercept of ln(ki) (i = 1, 2, 3, −1, −3)
versus 1/T charts. The specific calculation results
are shown in Tables 1, 2, and 4.

As
shown in Table 2, R2 was greater than 0.99, which suggested that
ln(ki) had a good linear relationship
with 1/T, and the obtained reaction rate constants
satisfied the Arrhenius expression. Compared with the values reported
in the literature, the results from the literature and those currently
adjusted from the experimental kinetic data reported in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 were almost
the same; however, the value of ΔH1 was better (Table 3) than that reported in other studies.48 The difference between the reaction rate constants and other parameters
could be explained as being due to the presence of a catalyst, different
temperatures, and different substrate concentrations.

The calculated
data were used to plot the changes in the three organic acid concentrations
over time at each temperature, and the curves were combined with experimental
data to form Figure 3a–d. It was found that the figures drawn by the equations
were better matched with the experimental data points. The trends
for the three organic acids were consistent with that of the graph
line, which further proved the accuracy of the experimental data.

and calculated (solid line) variations

temperatures (a) 190 °C, (b) 200 °C, (c) 210 °C, and
(d) 220 °C. Black for maleic acid; red for fumaric acid; and
blue for malic acid.

As shown in Table 1, as the temperature increased, the forward reaction rate constant
of reaction (1) (the
reaction rate constant of conversion of maleic acid to fumaric acid)
increased continuously from 2.5 to 8.71 h–1. In
addition, at each temperature, the forward reaction rate constant
of reaction (1) was the
largest, and the reverse reaction rate constant was relatively less
than 0.32 h–1. This was because cis-maleic acid was easily attacked on account of its small steric effect
and was transformed into malic acid and fumaric acid.40 The reaction rate constants of reactions
(2) and (3) increased
slightly with temperature, but they did not reach the elevated level
of reaction (1). It was
indicated that the high selective conversion of fumaric acid could
be well achieved by adjusting the temperature.

As indicated
in Table 5, with increasing
temperature, the absolute value of the Gibbs free energy in reaction (1) decreased, while
that in reaction (3) showed
an increasing trend. It was suggested that the spontaneous inhibition
of the conversion from maleic acid to fumaric acid was weakened, while
the spontaneous inhibition of the conversion from malic acid to fumaric
acid increased with increasing temperature. This meant that the conversion
from maleic acid to fumaric acid and the conversion from fumaric acid
to malic acid were inhibited by the increase in temperature. This
echoed the conclusion of Ortiz et al. that a temperature rise reduces
the selectivity for malic acid.48

Discussion on Product Selectivity
For practical purposes, the selectivity of the conversion of maleic
acid to fumaric acid and malic acid remains to be studied. The reason
for this is that the rapid conversion of maleic acid to fumaric acid
with high selectivity is conducive to the development of a production
process for fumaric acid. It is particularly noteworthy that when
the temperature increases from 463 to 493 K, the maximum selectivity
time for fumaric acid decreases. At the same time, the selectivity
for malic acid decreased first and then increased with reaction time.
Selectivity is determined by using the following equation. 20  

Analysis of Influencing Factors
Effect
of Initial Reactant Concentration
To evaluate the effect
of the initial concentration of maleic acid on the reaction, the intersubstance
conversion was investigated. As shown in Figure 4, the amount of fumaric acid increased with
increasing initial maleic acid concentration. At the same time, the
conversion rate of maleic acid also increased with increasing fumaric
acid concentration. In addition, the yield of malic acid first increased
and then tended to balance out. Because the reduction in water content
was not favorable for the conversion of maleic acid and fumaric acid
to malic acid, more maleic acid could be converted to fumaric acid,
and the selectivity of fumaric acid was enhanced. Furthermore, once
the temperature was too high, the products were oxidized, thereby
leading to the possibility of coking products being formed in the
reaction vessel.

Figure 4 Concentrations of maleic acid, malic acid, and fumaric
acid vary
with the initial maleic acid concentration in the reaction (1 h).

Effect of Reaction
Temperature and Time
The effects of reaction temperature
and reaction time on the mutual transformation of materials were investigated.
A maleic acid solution with an initial mass fraction of 60% was selected
and was subject to an experiment from 0 to 4 h at 190, 200, 210, and
220 °C. As shown in Figure 5a,b, the rate of fumaric acid production was faster
when the reaction temperature was increased. This was because the
reaction rate constant for the formation of fumaric acid became larger
due to the increase in temperature. At the same time, the yield of
fumaric acid increased with increasing time in the initial stage,
while it decreased when the reaction time was over 1 h. This was because
the concentration of fumaric acid increased as the reactions proceeded,
thereby promoting the conversion of fumaric acid to maleic acid and
malic acid.

Figure 5 Variation
in fumaric
acid yield with reaction temperature and reaction time. (a) Fumaric
acid yield changes with temperature. (b) Fumaric acid yield changes
with time.

Further analysis of Figure 5a showed that the amount of fumaric acid
increased significantly as the temperature increased within 0.75 h.
However, as the reaction time continued to increase, the effect of
temperature on the reaction became less pronounced. When the reaction
time was over 1 h, the conversion of fumaric acid decreased with increasing
temperature. This was because the content of fumaric acid increased
with the reaction time, while the content of maleic acid continued
to decrease, which caused the main reactions to become the reactions
of conversion of fumaric acid to maleic acid and malic acid. As shown
in Figure 5b, the maximum
yield of fumaric acid decreased slightly (approximately 1%) and the
time of the maximum conversion rate decreased with increasing temperature.
This could be explained by the fact that the increase in temperature
enhanced the reaction rate constant for maleic acid, which reduced
the reaction time. A slight decrease was because, although the formation
of fumaric acid was inhibited by the increase in temperature, the
conversion from malic acid to fumaric acid was promoted. Furthermore,
on the falling phase, the higher the temperature, the faster the fumaric
acid decreased. This was because the reaction rate constants of reactions (3) and (1) increased as the temperature increased, which caused fumaric
acid to be converted to maleic acid and malic acid more rapidly at
a higher concentration of fumaric acid. The fumaric acid content at
which the final fumaric acid concentration reached an equilibrium
decreased with increasing temperature, which was illustrated by the
change in the Gibbs free energy and the reaction rate constants with
increasing temperature. As the temperature increased, the absolute
value of the Gibbs free energy of reaction (1) decreased, which indicated that the selectivity
of the reaction to form fumaric acid decreased, causing more fumaric
acid to be converted to maleic acid. At the same time, since the rate
constant of reaction (2) increased significantly with increasing temperature, more maleic
acid was converted to malic acid. Although the selectivity of reaction (3) to produce fumaric
acid was enhanced with increasing temperature, the reaction rate constant
for conversion to obtain fumaric acid was small, and the reaction
was not affected much.

Conclusions
Highly selective conversion from maleic acid to fumaric acid was
achieved by a simple one-step hydrothermal synthesis at four different
temperatures without any catalyst, and the kinetics of the mutual
conversion of maleic acid, fumaric acid, and malic acid were studied.
The highly selective process had higher stability and fumaric acid
yield and could be used to obtain the desired fumaric acid product
without a catalyst. Through the mutual confirmation of the data spectra
and the kinetic parameters, the mutual transformation of the three
organic acids under hydrothermal conditions was studied systematically
and completely for the first time and reached a level superior to
that obtained in previous reports. Based on the kinetic data obtained
experimentally, 20 reaction rate constants were determined, and the Ea values of 5 reactions were calculated. It
was found that the time to reach the highest yield point of fumaric
acid could be effectively reduced with increasing temperature and
that a high concentration of fumaric acid in the conversion process
can convert fumaric acid into malic acid, which provided the guidance
on the development of related production processes. The change in
the Gibbs free energy in each reaction reflected the fact that an
increase in temperature was not favorable for the formation of fumaric
acid from maleic acid, but instead promoted the formation of fumaric
acid from malic acid and reduced the selectivity of malic acid. This
study showed that the highly selective conversion of fumaric acid
can be achieved by a hydrothermal method and that the conversion of
malic acid can also be achieved by conditional control without a catalyst.
Therefore, the hydrothermal synthesis of fumaric acid and malic acid
without a catalyst has huge commercial potential.
