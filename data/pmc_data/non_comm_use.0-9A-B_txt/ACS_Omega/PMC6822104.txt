Hg(II)
contamination in water resources is one of the major health
issues in keeping the purity standard of the municipal water supply.
Herein, we report a new mesoporous sensor probe material SBA-ABZ-PEA
having a 2D-hexagonally ordered mesoporous framework bearing covalently
bonded fluorescent sites, and this has been synthesized through a
two-step post-synthesis grafting route. A pure silica mesoporous SBA-15
material has been functionalized with (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane
(ClPTES) to obtain chloro-functionalized SBA-15, which was further
reacted with 4-aminobenzaldehyde followed by treatment
with 2-(2-pyridyl)-ethylamine resulting in functionalized 2D-hexagonal
mesoporous sensor probe SBA-ABZ-PEA. Small angle PXRD, N2 adsorption/desorption, HRTEM, TGA, and FT-IR studies have been carried
out to characterize these materials. Our experimental results suggested
successful grafting of the organic moiety on the SBA-15 surface along
with preservation of mesoporosity throughout the grafting process.
Photoluminescence measurements were carried out in the aqueous suspension
of SBA-ABZ-PEA in the presence of different metal cations, like NaI, MgII, AlIII, KI, CaII, MnII, CoII, CuII, ZnII, CdII, PbII, and HgII.
This result revealed that, among the various metal-ions, the emission
intensity of the mesoporous sensing probe material SBA-ABZ-PEA has
been dramatically quenched in the presence of the HgII ion.
To check the sensitivity of the sensor probe, the fluorescence emission
was also studied in the presence of different concentrations of HgII ions. A perfect linear plot between the concentrations of
HgII ions in the aqueous medium with their corresponding
fluorescence intensities with a detection limit of 1.2 × 10–6 M has been observed.

1 Introduction
Rapid industrial development
in technologically advanced countries
resulted in a serious environmental problem due to the large release
of chemical wastes and subsequent contamination of heavy metal ions
in water resources.1−4 Among the heavy metal ions, mercury (Hg) is one of the most hazardous
metals in its different forms like metallic, ionic, and organometallic.
They can cause severe life threatening diseases such as acrodynia
or pink disease, Minamata disease, and Hunter-Russell syndrome.5 Large-scale contamination of Hg(II) can occur
by a variety of natural and anthropogenic activities.6 Electrical appliances like lamps, arc rectifiers, and mercury
cells necessary for industrial activities are very easy sources of
HgII contamination when discharged into water bodies. It
has been analyzed that even the presence of an ultratrace amount of
HgII ions beyond its permissible limit (1 to 10 μg/L)
damages our central nervous system tremendously.7 The aquatic living bodies8 also
face severe damage by HgII contamination. Abnormal chromosome
distribution is a fatal effect of HgII poisoning, and divisional
malfunction of chromosomes leads to genetic defects with abnormal
cell division. Therefore, rapid and selective detection as well as
the removal of HgII ions is very challenging in the context
of safe water supply and healthy living of plants and animals.9 Nanomaterials act as biosensors for the removal
of bioaccumulative mercury with great efficacy. It is applied for
in vivo purpose also as Hg2+ can be anchored with a DNA
base pair.10,11 Nanocrystals are used as adsorbents
to remove the Hg(II) from wastewater.12 Magnetic nanosorbents as well as thiol-functionalized nanomaterials
are widely employed for the fast removal of mercury because of their
high adsorption capacity.13−15

Different detection methods
including atomic absorption spectroscopy,16,17 inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopic method (ICP-MS),18 and voltammetry19 are conventionally employed to measure and detect the metal ions
present in solutions. However, most of these methods are either time-consuming,
costly, and require sophisticated instruments. On the other hand,
fluorescent chemosensors can detect heavy metal ions as well as various
analytes with less effort and also in quite a cost-effective way.20 They also show advantages in easy and quick
detection together with high selectivity. Since the side effect of
the industrialization is so severe especially in the case of HgII contamination, a large-scale research activity has been
focused in developing fluorescent sensors to combat HgII contamination in pure water. So, it becomes an obvious challenge
that sensor probes are designed in such a way so that they can be
applied in water with good efficacy to detect toxic and poisonous
metals in the presence of other nonharmful metal ions.21,22

Porous nanomaterials with pore dimensions varying from sub-nanometer
(microporous) to several nanometer (mesoporous) length scales are
intensively studied over the years due to their potential in several
frontline application areas and their reusability.23−26 These solids are quite stable
in water, which could make them ideal candidates for ground water
purification. Among them, the mesoporous SBA-1527−30 material is often employed as
a support to enhance the material properties due to its structural
features such as high surface area with a thick pore wall, uniformly
ordered pore channels, high thermal stability, optical transparency
in the visible region, and high biocompatibility.31 Due to such beneficial factors, it is widely explored in
adsorption,32 catalysis,33,34 optoelectronics,35 and optical sensors.36 The mesoporous silicas can be surface-functionalized
through different organic functional groups by grafting or co-condensation
approaches37 so that the resulting material
can bind different metal ions via strong coordination. So, organic
fluorophore moieties bound at the surface of the mesoporous silicas
have become an important research area for selective adsorption and
sensing applications.38−41 Thus, considerable research efforts have been devoted in developing
novel sensor probes based on mesoporous SBA-15 to detect Hg and other
heavy metals from water resources.42−45

In this context, it is
pertinent to mention that chelating functional
groups bearing a simultaneous presence of polarizable imine-N and
pyridinic-N can offer selective binding of HgII present
in the aqueous media, and this has not been explored before. Here,
we have functionalized the surface of SBA-15 with a fluorescent probe
bearing simultaneous imine-N and pyridinic-N species, which can detect
HgII ions from contaminated water with great efficacy.
The synthesis is based on the stepwise surface functionalization of
mesoporous silica material SBA-15 with organic functional groups (after
functionalization of SBA-15, the material is abbreviated as SBA for
simplicity), and this is outlined for the synthesis of SBA-ABZ-PEA
in Scheme 1. This probe
exhibits excellent efficacy in HgII detection in a water
medium with a detection limit of 1.2 × 10–6 M.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Materials
2.1.1 Ordered Mesophase
Small angle powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) plots of chloro-functionalized SBA-15, that
is, SBA-Pr-Cl, and organic ligand grafted sensing probe SBA-ABZ-PEA
are presented in Figure 1. Both of them exhibited three well-resolved broad Bragg reflections
at (100), (110), and (200) at the small 2θ angle range between
0.6 and 2.5°. These are the characteristic peaks of the 2D-hexagonal
mesophase, which confirmed their ordered mesoporous framework.46 The incorporation of organic components into
the pore channels caused the decrease of the mesoscopic order of the
pores, and it was confirmed by the significant decrease of intensities
of the (110) and (200) peaks in SBA-ABZ-PEA. However, in both cases,
the strongest peak for d100 appears in
the position 2θ = 0.98°, which confirmed the retention
of 2D-hexagonal periodicity of the mesophase after the stepwise functionalization.

and SBA-ABZ-PEA (b).

2.1.2 Nanostructure
The HRTEM image of
the present sensor probe SBA-ABZ-PEA (Figure 2) showed the uniform distribution of ordered
mesopores with a hexagonal arrangement and honeycomb-like fashion.
It was found that the pore width lies in the range of approximately
7–7.5 nm throughout the specimen, whereas for the nonfunctionalized
SBA-15 material it generally lies between 8 and 9 nm. So, the lowering
of the pore diameter in SBA-ABZ-PEA revealed the successful grafting
of organic ligands into the porous framework.

2.1.3 Porosity and Surface
Area
The texture
of pores of the sensor probe SBA-ABZ-PEA was measured by N2 adsorption/desorption analysis at 77 K, and this is shown in Figure 3. An isotherm of
type IV along with a typically large hysteresis loop was obtained
in the pressure range P/P0 of 0.5–0.7, which revealed the mesoporous nature of the complex.47 The surface area and pore volume of SBA-ABZ-PEA
obtained by this study were 272 m2 g–1 and 0.357 cm3 g–1, respectively. Periodic
hexagonal arrangements of 4.1 nm size pores were found throughout
the mesostructure of SBA-ABZ-PEA estimated by the nonlocal density
functional theory (NLDFT, shown in the inset of Figure 3) method.

2.1.4 Framework and Bonding
The infrared
spectral study showed two characteristic peaks at 792 and 1063 cm–1, which were due to the Si–O–Si stretching
vibration present in all the materials, that is, in SBA-15, SBA-Pr-Cl,
SBA-Pr-ABZ, and SBA-ABZ-PEA. So, the silica framework was present
in all the complexes. All of them contained a common band around 1635
cm–1 due to the water molecules adsorbed in the
frameworks. In spectra (b), the incorporation of the CH2–Cl group in pristine SBA-15 was confirmed by the observed
bands at 2935 and 2988 cm–1 due to the symmetric
and asymmetric stretching of −CH2– groups.
Thus, it can be said that the chloropropyl chain was present in SBA-Pr-Cl.
In the third step of the complex synthesis, 4-aminobenzaldehyde was
anchored onto the framework, which was named SBA-Pr-ABZ. The spectrum
recorded for this complex (Figure 4c) showed the stretching vibration at 2961 cm–1, characteristic of a secondary N–H group. In the SBA-ABZ-PEA
(spectra (d)) due to imine bond formation, a peak was observed near
1706 cm–1, whereas a peak at 1532 cm–1 confirmed the C=N stretching frequency of the pyridinyl moiety.

SBA-ABZ-PEA (d).

2.1.5 Thermogravimetric
Analysis
Thermal
analysis of the SBA-ABZ-PEA material (Figure 5) showed that it is stable up to 210 °C.
The initial weight loss (∼4%) near the 200 °C temperature
could be attributed to the removal of the physically adsorbed solvent
and water molecules from the mesoporous surface and inner channels.
However, a further increase in temperature causes gradual loss of
the covalently anchored organic moieties, and we observed the maximum
weight loss of ∼11.0% in the temperature range of 200–600
°C.

2.2 Photoluminescence Property
After
the successful synthesis of the mesoporous SBA-ABZ-PEA, the next step
was to investigate its solution-phase luminescence property. In a
typical experiment, the aqueous dispersion of SBA-ABZ-PEA was excited
at 270 nm and the emission spectrum was recorded instantaneously.
It showed an intense emission peak at 486 nm with a shoulder situated
at 408 nm. The same results were obtained in the case of several other
commonly used organic solvents like CH3CN, CH3OH, C2H5OH, and DMSO.

2.3 Sensing
of Metal Ions
The interaction
at the molecule-material interface48 plays
a crucial role in the overall selectivity for the particular ion/molecule.
We have measured the sensory aptitude of this mesoporous Hg-sensor
toward different metal ions via interaction of the aqueous suspension
of SBA-ABZ-PEA with 2 mM solution of several metal ions like NaI, KI, CaII, MgII, AlIII, MnII, FeIII, CoII, NiII, CuII, PbII, ZnII, CdII, and HgII. All the spectral changes were recorded
immediately after addition of the metal ion solution. Interestingly,
the characteristic peak of SBA-ABZ-PEA appeared at 486 nm diminishes
rapidly upon addition of HgII solution, whereas in other
cases no significant changes of emission intensity were observed under
the same experimental condition (Figure 6). Fluorimetric titration with incremental
addition of HgII solution leads to turn-off fluorescence
quenching, which clearly indicates that our mesoporous material shows
high affinity toward HgII ions over all other cations (Figure 7).

Figure 6 Quenching of fluorescence
intensity of SBA-ABZ-PEA upon addition
of 2 mM 200 μL solution of various metal ions.

Figure 7 Turn-off quenching upon incremental addition of HgII solution
to the SBA-ABZ-PEA dispersion.

In order to investigate the mechanism of quenching, the entire
sensing phenomena were reanalyzed with the Stern–Volmer equation Io/I = Ksv[Q] + 1, where Io is the emission
intensity of the fluorophore probe, I is the intensity
after addition of the required amount of HgII solution
in the reaction medium, Ksv denotes the quenching
constant, and Q is the concentration of the added
analyte. After fitting in the aforementioned equation, a linear increase
of (Io/I – 1)
with the incremental addition of HgII solution was observed
with a slope value of 1.5 × 104 M–1 (Figure 8a). Hence,
it can be presumed that the quenching pattern showed a static nature
(obtained from the linearity of the curve) leading to a direct binding
between the HgII ion with some specific part of the SBA-ABZ-PEA.
The high quenching constant value (1.5 × 104 M–1) also satisfies the fact of the strong binding interaction
between the HgII and SBA-ABZ-PEA.

Figure 8 (a) SV plot of incremental
addition of HgII in the aqueous
solution of SBA-ABZ-PEA, (b) calculation of LOD of HgII. We have plotted the ratio of two luminescence intensities in the Y axis.

For better understanding
of the promptness of detection, the limit
of detection (LOD) was calculated using the equation 3σ/slope,
where σ is the standard deviation calculated during the measurement
of five consecutive scans and the slope obtained via plotting the
fluorescence intensity against the concentration of HgII. The obtained LOD was found to be 1.2 × 10–6 M (Figure 8b). This
value clearly indicates that a very low concentration of HgII is enough for the instant fluorescence quenching of the synthesized
material.

Previous experiments for exploring the sensing ability
for metal
cations over functionalized mesoporous materials49 have limited success due to the stability of the material.
Interestingly, in comparison with those literature values, the synthesized
SBA-ABZ-PEA displayed excellent chemosensing of HgII together
with several aspects like extensive water phase stability, very low
detection limit toward HgII, and instant fluorescence quenching
(Figure 9). In fact,
a very
small amount of prepared SBA-ABZ-PEA was enough to carry out the entire
sensing experiment.

Figure 9 Fluorescence quenching of SBA-ABZ-PEA in the presence
of HgII+ along with other metal ions (II to VI) where I
= HgII only, II = HgII, CdII, ZnII, III = HgII, NaI, KI, CaII, IV = HgII, MgII, AlIII, V = HgII, CoII, FeII, MnII, VI =
HgII, NiII, PbII, CuII.

2.4 Selectivity
and Specificity
Apart
from the aforementioned utilities, selectivity and specificity are
the major requirements for an efficient chemosensor. Hence, the specificity
of the fluorophore probe toward HgII in the concomitant
presence of other metal ions was analyzed. In a prolonged experiment,
some other metal ions were added simultaneously to the uniformly dispersed
solution of the SBA-ABZ-PEA containing HgII ions in it.
Strikingly, no obvious change of the fluorescence intensity was observed.
This phenomenon lucidly indicates the high selectivity and specificity
of the mesoporous probe toward the HgII ion over a variety
of cations.

2.5 Mechanistic Insights
The high selectivity
of mesoporous sensor probe SBA-ABZ-PEA toward the HgII ion
could be ascribed due to strong Hg–N bond formation by coordination,
which leads to a six-membered chelate structure. The structure of
the sensor probe SBA-ABZ-PEA is quite selective due to some underlying
reasons. HgII is a soft metal center and larger in size,
so preferentially it avoids covalent bond formation with hard donor
centers.50 Moreover, the soft acidic nature
of the HgII ion can make good coordination with the soft
basic/borderline ligand system having nitrogen centers.51 The preferential and selective quenching by
the HgII ion can be ascertained by the heavy atom effect
as well as the spin–orbit coupling effect in fluorescence emission52,53 and the high electrophilic nature of HgII, which causes
an appreciable amount of chelation between fluorophoric organic moiety
bearing imine-N and pyridinic-N and HgII centers54 over other cations. Strong coordination of the
lone pairs from nitrogen centers of the ligand system to metal is
the reason for high quenching efficiency.37 The suggested mechanistic pathway for Hg(II) adsorption is illustrated
in Scheme 2.

3 Conclusions
We can conclude that an organically
functionalized mesoporous SBA-15-based
HgII sensor SBA-ABZ-PEA can be developed by a simple surface
functionalization strategy. It was found that SBA-ABZ-PEA performed
as a solid fluorescent sensor probe for the detection of the HgII ion in an aqueous medium. When a large number of other metal
cations were present, then this mesoporous sensor could detect HgII ions with great selectivity. Upon addition of the HgII ion in the aqueous suspension of the probe, its emission
intensity decreases drastically and quenching of fluorescence occurred.
Selective fluorescence sensing behavior of SBA-ABZ-PEA bearing imine
and pyridinic N-sites grafted at the mesopore surface provides a successful
chemosensor for the detection of HgII from contaminated
water, and this has huge future potential for the detection of HgII from contaminated ground water resources.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Triblock
copolymer Pluronic
P123, (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane (ClPTES), tetraethylorthosilicate
(TEOS), 4-aminobenzaldehyde, and 2-(2-pyridyl) ethylamine were purchased
from Sigma Aldrich. Ethanol, toluene, and all other solvents were
obtained from Merck. These materials were not further purified before
use. The chloride salts of all the metals (Sigma Aldrich) were used
to prepare the stock solutions.

4.2 Synthesis
of HgII Sensor
The sensing probe was prepared
by post-synthesis functionalization
of the SBA-15 material. At first, surface modification of porous SBA-15
has been carried out by treatment of (3-chloropropyl)triethoxysilane
followed by anchoring of 4-aminobenzaldehyde with it. Finally, 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine
was condensed with the anchored material by the Schiff base condensation
method to get the sensing probe SBA-ABZ-PEA. The outline of the synthesis
is given in Scheme 1.

4.2.1 Synthesis of SBA-15
Mesoporous
SBA-15 was synthesized by using the triblock copolymer Pluronic P123
poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly (propylene glycol)-block- poly(ethylene glycol) (EO20-PO70-EO20). In a typical procedure, 4.0 g of Pluronic P123
was stirred with 30 g of water followed by 120 g of 2 M HCl at 40
°C. 8.50 g (40.8 mmol) of tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS; Aldrich)
was added to the whole mixture and kept at constant stirring conditions
for 20 h maintaining the same above temperature. The aging process
was done at 80 °C for 24 h to obtain the solid product. Finally,
it was filtered, washed thoroughly with distilled water to make it
acid-free, and dried at room temperature overnight. The calcination
of the solid was performed at 550 °C for 6 h in air to remove
all the residual organic templates to obtain the pure SBA-15.

4.2.2 Synthesis of Chloro-Functionalized SBA-15
(SBA-Pr-Cl)
The mesoporous and calcined SBA-15 was synthesized
as per the reported method.26 Chloro-functionalized
SBA-15 was prepared in stirring and refluxing conditions for 24 h
where 0.20 g of as-synthesized SBA-15 was taken in 10 mL of dry toluene
and 0.6 mmol (0.144 g) of ClPTES was added to it dropwise under a
N2 atmosphere. A white solid was obtained after cooling
the suspension at room temperature. Finally, it was filtered, washed
several times with a measured amount of toluene, dichloromethane,
and diethyl ether, and allowed to dry at room temperature.

4.2.3 Covalent Grafting of 4-Aminobenzaldehyde
on SBA-Pr-Cl (SBA-Pr-ABZ)
0.30 g of methanolic suspension
of SBA-Pr-Cl was stirred in a 50 mL round bottom flask. Then 10 mL
of methanolic solution of 0.1175 g of 4-aminobenzaldehyde (1.03 mmol)
was gradually added to it. Then 0.104 g of triethylamine (TEA) (1.029
mmol) was added under refluxing conditions to the whole mixture and
kept for 24 h without further interruption. Finally, it was cooled,
washed thoroughly with methanol, and filtered through suction.

4.2.4 Synthesis of Sensor Probe SBA-ABZ-PEA
The powdered
SBA-Pr-ABZ was taken in 30 mL of ethanolic solution
of 0.135 g of 2-(2-pyridyl)ethylamine (1.12 mmol) and refluxed with
stirring for 24 h. Finally, the solid was filtered, washed abundantly
with ethanol, Soxhlet-extracted with CH2Cl2,
and dried in vacuum. The yellowish material obtained was denoted as
SBA-ABZ-PEA (Scheme 1).

4.2.5 Fabrication of SBA-ABZ-PEA for Fluorescence
Analysis
To investigate the fluorescence activity of the
synthesized mesoporous SBA-ABZ-PEA in an aqueous medium, 5.0 mg of
the SBA-ABZ-PEA was dispersed in 100 mL of double distilled water
by the ultrasonic method. During the fluorescence activity measurement
process, 2.5 mL of the above dispersion was taken in a quartz cell
and excited with a radiation of 270 nm wavelength light source. Sensor
aptitude of the mesoporous probe toward different metal ions was checked
using 2 mM aqueous solution of the chloride salts of NaI, KI, CaII, MgII, AlIII, MnII, FeIII, CoII, NiII, CuII, PbII, ZnII, CdII, and HgII prepared in double distilled water. Considerable
quenching of the emission intensity was observed only upon addition
of varying amounts of HgII solution (stock solution) in
the aqueous dispersion of SBA-ABZ-PEA. The experiments were carried
out under room temperature and similar conditions for each cationic
solution.

4.3 Characterization of Materials
FT-IR
spectra of the synthesized materials were recorded by a Nicolet MAGMA-FT
IR 750 Spectrometer Series II. A Bruker D8 Advance X-ray diffractometer
with Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation of wavelength 0.15406 nm was
used to obtain PXRD patterns. The morphology of the material was detected
by HR-TEM images by using a JEOL 2010 TEM operated at potential of
200 kV. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was performed in a TGA instruments
thermal analyzer TASDTQ-600 under constant N2 flow. An
Autosorb iQ of Quantachrome Instruments was used to record the surface
area of the materials by adsorption of N2 gas at 77 K.
Before the adsorption study, materials were kept in vacuum and degassed
for 8 h at 373 K. The luminescence spectral detection was done by
a PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorescence spectrometer instrument where the
path length of quartz cell was 1 cm.
