In
this study, we report a unique strategy that utilizes ZnO and
ZnS microparticles and rods as fire-retardant materials when coated
onto cotton fabrics. ZnO and ZnO/ZnS microparticles or rods were grown
or adsorbed to the surface of cotton fibers. Properties such as heat
release rate, total smoke release, and mass loss rate of the materials
were tested using a cone calorimeter. ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods were able
to reduce the heat release rate and total smoke release from 118 kW/m2 and 18.3 m2/m2 to about 70.0 kW/m2 and 6.00 m2/m2, respectively. The maximum
average rate of heat emission and fire growth rate index, which is
used to evaluate the fire spread rate, the size of the fire, and the
propensity of fire development, were improved with these coatings
and indicate that there are potential applications of these materials
as fire retardants.

Introduction
Cotton fabrics have
played an important role in the manufacturing
of clothing and furniture in the military and civilian sectors because
of their desirable properties such as biodegradability, water absorbency,
breathability, and the vast availability of raw materials for large-scale
production.1,2 Cotton fabrics, however, can be easily ignited
and pose a high risk for fires because cellulosic fibers have a low
limiting oxygen index, a low onset ignition temperature (360–425
°C), and provide a rich source of hydrocarbon fuels during combustion,
which makes these materials highly flammable.3−7 According to recent statistics, fires cause approximately
1.3 million accidents annually, which result in more than 3000 deaths,
15 000 injuries, and an estimated $11.6 billion in direct property
losses.8 Home fires, where the main fire
hazard is the combustion of textiles, are responsible for 80% of civilian
fire deaths.9

The most widely used
flame-retardant strategy for cotton fabrics
consists of weaving or coating the cellulose fibers with a flame-retardant
polymer or compound to form a composite material.10−16 Cotton fabrics can be directly coated with halogenated, nitrogen-containing
or phosphorus-containing additives to improve their fire-resistant
properties, but many of these compounds are limited in use because
of their demonstrated toxicity. Halogenated flame retardants react
with oxygen or hydroxyl radicals in the gas phase to effectively interrupt
combustion.6 However, toxic species released
from the combustion of halogenated flame retardants are hazardous
to human health and to the environment.17−20 Because of these concerns, the
use of halogenated flame-retardant materials has been rigorously restricted.21,22 In addition to the gas-phase flame-retardant mechanism, nitrogen-
and phosphorus-containing compounds also exhibit flame-retardant action
in the condensed phase, which is attributed to the formation of a
ceramic-like char during thermal degradation, which provides a layer
of insulation to the underlying polymer.6,23,24 Char-forming compounds such as ammonium polyphosphate,
tetrakishydroxymethyl phosphonium chloride, sodium hypophosphite (SHP),
and spirocyclic pentaerythritol diphosphoryl chloride have been widely
used as effective and durable flame-retardant coatings for cotton
fabrics.25,26 Nevertheless, studies suggest that phosphorus-containing
compounds produce large amounts of smoke, may be toxic, potential
mutagens, or pose unwanted risks to human health and the environment.3,27−30

New flame-retardant strategies are based on incorporating
insulating
inorganic materials into cotton fabrics, a strategy that mimics the
formation of a char layer of nitrogen- and phosphorous-containing
compounds. Silicate nanoclays and ZnO nanoparticles have been introduced
into phosphorus-based polymeric flame retardants using the sol–gel
method,11 dual-cure processes,13 and layer-by-layer assembly.31 Lam and co-workers combined N-methylol
dimethylphosphono propionamide with nano- and microscale ZnO particles
and showed that ZnO can act as a cocatalyst to promote the formation
of a char layer to enhance the flame-retardant action of cotton fabrics.32,33 Sharaf’s group also observed improved flame retardancy when
they combined nano-ZnO with polycarboxylic acids and SHP with cotton
fabrics.3

On the basis of these promising
reports and the work previously
performed by our co-workers,34 we investigated
the combustion properties of cotton treated with spherical and rod-shaped
particles of ZnO and ZnS as potential fire retardants using cone calorimetry.
To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated the flame-retardant
properties of these ZnO-based coatings on cotton surfaces alone without
the aid of other, usually harmful, flame-retardant additives. The
designed Zn-based microparticle coatings were expected to act as a
protective layer of insulation34,35 and as a smoke suppressant
because zinc salts have been shown to reduce the production of smoke
during burning.36−38 ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods were grown on cotton fabrics
using a hydrothermal method previously published by our group.39,40 In this paper, we show that even loosely adsorbed spherical microparticles
of ZnO and ZnS can reduce the heat release rate (HRR) when coated
on cotton fabrics independent of an organic flame retardant. We also
show that the uniform protective coating of ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods on
the cotton surface results in a lower peak HRR (PkHRR), a lower fire
growth rate (FIGRA) index, a lower maximum average rate of heat emission
(MARHE), and a lower specific extinction area (SEA) compared to cotton
alone.24,41

Characterization
The morphology
of the ZnO/ZnS structures as well as their attachment
to the surface of the cotton samples was verified using a scanning
electron microscope with a beam voltage of 25 kV [FEI Quanta 600 FE-ESEM
equipped with an EVEX energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) system].
The samples were coated with a thin (5–10 nm) layer of Au/Pt
prior to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging. Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM) was performed on ZnO and ZnO/ZnS nanostructures
using a JEOL-JEM 2100 TEM equipped with an EVEX EDS system. Thermogravimetric
analysis (TGA) was used to investigate the thermal decomposition of
cotton samples with microparticle coatings using a Q-50 thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE). Samples weighed about 15–20
mg and were heated in a Pt pan. Experiments were carried out in both
air and nitrogen atmospheres (50 mL/min) using a heating rate of 20
°C/min in a temperature range of 25–700 °C. Diffraction
patterns were taken on a Rigaku SmartLab X-ray diffractometer (Cu
Kα radiation) at a scan rate of 1°/min.

The combustion
behavior of the cotton samples was investigated
with a cone calorimeter (ISO 5660-1, Fire Testing Technology) at a
heat flux of 50 kW/m2 in a horizontal configuration. An
electric ignitor was utilized to ignite the cotton during tests. The
calorimeter was equipped with a gas analyzer. Nine layers of cotton
were placed in the aluminum holder of the cone calorimeter. A metallic
grid was placed on top of these cotton layers to maintain the configuration
and eliminate the space between layers in the retaining frame. A surface
area of 100 mm × 100 mm was exposed to radiation from the conical
heater. The following data were collected: time to ignition (TTI,
s), total heat release (THR, kW/m2), HRR (kW/m2), PkHRR (kW/m2), effective heat of combustion (EHC, MJ/kg),
mass loss rate (MLR, g/s), total smoke release (TSR, m2/m2), specific extinction area (SEA, m2/kg),
and CO and CO2 yield (kg/kg). The MARHE was evaluated and
is a measure of the propensity for the development of a fire.41 The FIGRA index was calculated as the ratio
of PkHRR to time to PkHRR, which is a figure used to evaluate the
fire spread rate and the size of the fire.24,41

Vertical flame tests were performed on 12″ × 3″
strips of fabric to study the effectiveness of the flame-retardant
coatings on cotton. The cotton strips were fastened to a metal frame
and hung inside a VC-2 vertical flame cabinet (Govmark, Farmingdale,
NY). The samples were then exposed to a Bunsen burner flame for 12
s, and the after-flame and after-glow times were recorded following
the ASTM D6413-08 protocol.

Results and Discussion
Characterization of Cotton
Samples
ZnO and/or ZnS particles
were coated onto cotton surfaces by physisorption. ZnO and ZnO/ZnS
rods were grown on the cotton fibers through a seed-mediated two-step
hydrothermal process, as described in the Procedures section. Commercially available ZnO and ZnO + ZnS microparticles
were physisorbed onto a cotton surface by dip-coating in a suspension
of ZnO (∼10 μm) and ZnS microparticles (∼10 μm)
sequentially. Figure 1a,b shows the SEM images of the ZnO and ZnO + ZnS spherical microparticles
adsorbed to the cotton mesh. Poor adhesion between the cotton surface
and the microparticles resulted in the clustering of ZnO and ZnS particles,
as can be seen from the elemental maps of Zn and S (Figure 1c,d). Figure 2a–d shows the representative SEM images
of cotton fibers coated with ZnO and ZnO/ZnS core/shell rods generated
by a 24 h reaction, which were fabricated using a hydrothermal process
previously reported by Athauda et al. (see the Procedures section).39 ZnO rods
were produced with an average length of 1300 ± 285 nm and a width
of 137 ± 39 nm (Figure 2a,c). A slight reduction in the average sizes of the ZnO/ZnS
core/shell rods occurred during the sulfidation process (l = 1207 ± 323 nm, w = 234 ± 42 nm) (Figure 2a,c).39Figure 2e shows that single crystals of ZnO coated the entire cellulose
fiber. The average thickness of the polycrystalline ZnS shell was
42.4 ± 7.5 nm, as measured from TEM images (Figure 2f).42Figure 3a,b shows
representative SEM images of cotton fibers coated with ZnO short rods
(l = 201.1 ± 35.33 nm, w =
210.1 ± 14.6 nm) generated by a 5 h hydrothermal reaction. Short
ZnO rods grew evenly on the fiber surface and formed a thin uniform
layer.

Cone Calorimetry
The percent mass loading, A, of the coatings was
calculated according to the following
formula:  where Wf is the
weight of samples after treatment with particles and W0 is the weight of the scoured cotton.43,44Table 1 shows the
percent mass loading of the seven sets of cotton samples analyzed.
ZnO/ZnS core/shell rods had a higher mass loading percentage (85–92%)
because they were chemically attached to the cotton fiber (Figures 1 and 2), unlike ZnO and ZnS microparticles. Prior studies have shown
that ZnO rod coatings on cotton fabrics withstand laundering conditions.45 None of the coatings qualitatively changed the
flexibility of cotton fabric.

The results of the combustion are presented in Table 2 from triplicate experiments.
The data show similar trends. The various zinc coatings did not significantly
or systematically improve the TTI of the cotton fabrics. However,
the THR was reduced by all of the coatings except for coatings bearing
ZnO + ZnS microparticles. ZnO short rod coatings had a slight improvement
in the THR compared with ZnO microparticles at a similar mass loading.
Cotton samples coated with ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods released the least
total amount of heat during combustion when compared to untreated
cotton and cotton samples treated with microparticle coatings (Table 2). ZnO/ZnS core/shell
rod coatings were more efficient at reducing the THR compared to ZnO
rods. This is likely due to the endothermic decomposition of the ZnS
shell on the ZnO surface.25,26 A similar trend was
observed for the EHC data (Table 2). All coatings reduced the EHC, but the effect was
more pronounced for ZnO, ZnO/ZnS rod, and ZnO short rod coatings. Figure 4 shows the HRR of
Zn coatings compared to untreated cotton. After ignition, the HRR
of untreated cotton increased rapidly in the first 60 s and, subsequently,
PkHRR occurred at 60 s. The PkHRR was reduced by all of the coatings,
and importantly, the time to reach the PkHRR increased (Figure 4). The HRR curves of ZnO seed,
ZnO short rod, ZnO microparticle, and ZnO + ZnS microparticle cotton
samples had similar features, but the peaks were shifted by 65–75
s compared to the untreated cotton. Cotton samples coated with microparticles
and ZnO seeds reduced the PkHRR by about 20–24% at a mass loading
of 1.6%, and ZnO short rods reduced the PkHRR by 33% at a mass loading
of 13.70%. The HRR of ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rod-coated cotton samples increased
dramatically within the first 25 s, just like the untreated cotton,
but a slowdown was evident in the following 80 s, which indicates
that the flame-retardant mechanism of the rod coatings was initiated
at 25 s. ZnO and ZnO/ZnS core/shell rod coatings were more effective
at retarding burning because the PkHRR was delayed (95–110
s) and reduced by 50%. This is mainly due to the uniform coverage
of the ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods on the fiber surface, which provides a
protective layer during combustion. The lower thermal conductivity
of the rod layer retards burning by slowing down heat transfer and
spreading and reduces the thermal pyrolysis rate of cotton.46−48 These data suggest that more time would be available to escape,
providing a better chance of survival.

CO2 production rate
curves from calorimetry experiments
are represented in Figure S1. Cotton samples
with coatings had a lower average CO2 yield and longer
burning time. Figure S1 reveals that the
fire-retardant mechanism occurs in the condensed phase.49 This indicates that the combustion was retarded
by coatings as a result of the protective layer of the crystals on
the surface of the fibers. Specific extinction area (SEA) and CO and
CO2 yield are also shown in Tables 2 and S2. SEA is
a smoke measurement that represents the instantaneous amount of smoke
released and the effective optical obscuring area generated per unit
mass loss of specimen.50 Untreated cotton
produced an optical obscuring area of 14.66 m2 per 1 kg
mass loss during burning (Table S2). Zn
coatings reduced the SEA, which means that the coatings could improve
visibility to allow individuals to escape in case of a real fire.
This is consistent with the work by others showing that Zn salts can
act as smoke suppressants and reduce the SEA as well.36−38 Compared to microparticle and seed coatings, rod coatings reduce
the SEA more effectively. This trend correlates well with the THR
and EHC data, which also result from the protective insulation layer
on the fiber surface that reduces the rate and intensity of combustion.
ZnO microparticles, ZnO seeds, and ZnO long and short rod coatings
reduced the CO yield, which results from slower and more complete
combustion of the fabric. ZnO + ZnS microparticle- and ZnO/ZnS rod-coated
cotton samples release more CO than untreated cotton. This is because
sulfur radicals produced from ZnS compete with other gas-phase radical
species for oxygen radicals to generate SO2, which affects
the combustion reactions in the flaming zone and leads to incomplete
combustion (less CO2 production).51−53 (The TSR data
are shown in Figure S1 and Table S2.) The mean MLR (MeanMLR) of the untreated
cotton samples during combustion was 8.54 g/s. This value was reduced
by all of the coatings, with ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rod coatings having the
highest reduction in MeanMLR of approximately 32%. This result is
consistent with ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rods forming a protective barrier
to prevent burning and/or reduce the intensity of combustion compared
to loosely adsorbed microparticles and small ZnO seed crystals.

The FIGRA index and MARHE are the two accepted evaluation parameters
of the reaction of a material to fire. The FIGRA index is used to
evaluate the fire spread rate and the size of the fire and calculated
as the ratio of PkHRR to time to PkHRR. MARHE is used to evaluate
the propensity of fire development and calculated as a ratio of the
accumulative heat emission to time. From the samples tested, coatings
with ZnO/ZnS core/shell and ZnO long rods exhibited a similar FIGRA
index and MARHE compared to ZnO long rod coatings and show a slight
improvement compared to ZnO short rod coatings (Table 2). At high temperatures, it has been reported
that ZnS decomposes endothermically to release sulfur radicals, which
react with oxygen to generate the nonflammable gas sulfur dioxide,
which further retards combustion.20,52,54 The nanolayer of ZnS on the core/shell rods is likely
not thick enough to show a significant improvement in the FIGRA and
MARHE values compared to long rods of ZnO.

Images of the cotton
samples taken after the combustion tests are
shown in Figure 5.
After burning, the untreated cotton sheets were completely turned
to ash, as shown in Figure 5a. Cotton samples coated with ZnO microparticles, ZnO + ZnS
microparticles, and ZnO seeds leave a white and/or light yellow solid
residue, which adheres to the aluminum holder (Figure 5a–d). The aluminum sample holders
were burned through because of the high intensity of heat loading
from combustion. ZnO short rod-, ZnO long rod-, and ZnO/ZnS rod-coated
cotton samples maintain the original shape of the cotton fabric, and
as a result, the aluminum holders survive intact after combustion
(Figure 5e–g).
SEM images of ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rod-coated cotton samples were taken
after cone calorimetry experiments and are shown in Figure 6. ZnO and ZnO/ZnS rod coatings
preserved the woven structure of the cotton fabric, as seen in Figure 6a–c. Individual
cotton fibers were completely consumed, but a hollow shell of ZnO
rods remained in place (Figure 6d–f). Short ZnO rods exhibited a hollow shell structure
after combustion, analogous to the longer ZnO rods, but the walls
were much thinner, and the shell is effectively more porous because
of lower mass loading (Figure 6f). High-magnification SEM images of ZnO rods that form the
protective layer around the cotton fibers are shown in Figure 6g,h. No damage or sintering
of neighboring rods was observed after combustion. Decomposition of
the ZnS shell on the ZnO/ZnS core/shell rods leaves behind ZnO rods
with textured surfaces, as shown in Figure 6h. Figure 6i shows a high-magnification SEM image of ZnO short
rods after burning. ZnO coatings were thermally stable and maintained
their size and shape at high temperatures regardless of size. Energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) experiments confirm
that the ZnS shell is no longer present on the surface of ZnO/ZnS
core/shell rods after combustion (Figures S2 and S3). SEM data together with the cone calorimetry experiments
suggest that the flame-retardant mechanism is the formation of a protective
layer of ZnO rods that acts as a barrier to limit radiative heat and
flames from penetrating the cotton surface. ZnO materials also exhibit
size-dependent thermal conductivity, that is, reduced thermal conductivity
with decreasing particle size.47,48 This may be one reason
why even ZnO seeds show good fire-retardant properties, and it also
presents an opportunity to further tune or exploit this property to
produce fire-retardant products and textiles.

rods. (f) Thickness of the formed hollow shell is much thinner for
ZnO short rods than for the other two samples, which is consistent
with the shorter length of the rods. Long (g) and short (i) ZnO rods
retain their shape after combustion, whereas the ZnS shell of the
ZnO/ZnS core/shell rods decomposed to leave behind textured ZnO rods
(h). Insets: magnified images of a rod to show its surface roughness.

Vertical Flame Tests
Flame tests were carried out in
the vertical orientation, and the data are shown in Table 3. None of the samples exhibited
self-extinguishing properties. ZnO microparticle, ZnO + ZnS microparticle,
ZnO seed, and ZnO short rod coatings became flaky and brittle and
detached from the frame, leaving behind no residue (Figure S4). Light flakiness was observed for ZnO and ZnO/ZnS
rod coatings. Residues were observed for cotton coatings of ZnO long
rods and ZnO/ZnS core/shell rods, and the residues maintained the
original shape of the fabric after the vertical flame tests. This
data are consistent with the results obtained from the cone calorimeter
(Figure 5). The after-flame
time was reduced for ZnO short and long rod coatings only, and the
after-glow time was reduced the most by ZnO long rods and ZnO/ZnS
core/shell rods compared to the control. These data suggest that even
at high mass loadings, these coatings do not exhibit self-extinguishing
behavior. Although the ZnO coatings reduce the HRR of cotton fabrics,
ideally, the coatings must be coupled with a chemical flame retardant
to exhibit self-extinguishing properties.

Thermal Stability
Thermal decomposition was studied
by TGA and differential thermal analysis (DTA) performed in air and
nitrogen (Figure 7).
The TGA curves collected in air (Figure 7a) show that the onset temperature of degradation
of untreated cotton was around 340 °C and peak decomposition
rate occurred at 350 °C (Figure 7b), as previously reported.55−57 The onset temperature
of degradation for untreated cotton was found to be higher in nitrogen
(Figure 7c) at around
350 °C. The peak decomposition rate occurred at 360 °C (Figure 7d), which is due
to the slower pyrolysis of cellulose under an inert atmosphere.57,58 Compared to untreated cotton, the onset temperature and peak decomposition
rate were not significantly changed by ZnO microparticle coatings
in air and nitrogen, which indicates that the coating did not improve
the thermal stability of cotton. The curve of ZnO + ZnS microparticle
coatings shows a decomposition onset temperature of 290 °C and
a steeper percentage weight loss from 290 to 340 °C, which is
due to the catalytic effect of sulfur on the decomposition of cellulose,
which causes mass loss at a lower temperature compared to untreated
cotton.55,59,60 This is a
result of direct contact of ZnS particles with the cotton surface.
ZnO seed-coated cotton samples show a trend similar to that of untreated
cotton below 350 °C in both air and nitrogen. A significant weight
loss event was observed in TG experiments of ZnO seed-coated cotton
performed in air at 370 °C (Figure 7a) and at 475 °C in DTA curves (Figure 7b). This is attributed
to the collapse of the thin protective layers of ZnO seeds on the
fiber surface and further oxidation and decomposition of the char
residue of the cotton, which is missing in tests performed under nitrogen
(Figure 7c,d).61 A similar onset temperature of degradation was
observed for coatings consisting of long and short ZnO rods under
both air and nitrogen, suggesting that these coatings also did not
improve the thermal stability of cotton samples. The onset temperature
of mass loss is lowered by ZnO/ZnS rod coatings, which is likely from
the endothermic decomposition of the ZnS shell.62,63 The leftover residue for all coated samples is ZnO (which does not
decompose) and an oxidized char of cotton (0.54 mass %).43,64,65 The TGA data are consistent with
the TTI data and show good correlation with the residue mass results
from the calorimetry experiments.

coatings in air (a,b) and in nitrogen (c,d), respectively (MP = microparticles).

Conclusions
We
show that ZnO materials, in general, are effective at reducing
the PkHRR even when unassisted by an organic fire retardant. ZnO particles
chemically grown on cotton formed a uniform protective coating on
the cotton surface, resulting in lower PkHRR, lower FIGRA, and lower
MARHE compared to cotton. However, the lack of self-extinguishing
properties suggests that coupling ZnO materials with other chemical/molecular
flame-retardant materials could improve flame retardancy. The functional
properties of ZnO, such as low thermal conductivity, high mechanical
strength,66 air permeability,67 UV absorption,68 favorable
whiteness index,69 and biocompatibility,70 coupled with the combustion behavior indicate
that these materials have a promising future as eventual fire-retardant
coatings on cotton fabrics.

Materials
Sodium hydroxide (ACS
reagent, ≥97.0%, pellets), Triton
X-100 (BioXtra), zinc acetate dihydrate (ACS reagent, ≥98%),
triethylamine (≥99%), zinc nitrate hexahydrate (≥99.0%,
crystallized), hexamethylenetetramine (ACS reagent, ≥99.0%),
zinc oxide (ACS reagent, ≥99.0%, powder), and zinc sulfide
(10 μm, 99.99%, powder) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO). Citric acid (ACS reagent, ≥99.0%, crystal) was
purchased from Spectrum Chemical Mfg. Corp. (New Brunswick, NJ). Sodium
sulfide (nonahydrate, ≥99.0%) was purchased from Fisher Science
Education (Nazareth, PA). Isopropyl alcohol (ACS reagent, ≥99%)
and ethyl alcohol 200 proof (absolute, anhydrous, and ACS/USP grade)
were purchased from Pharmco-AAPER (Shelbyville, KY). Bleached, desized
cotton fabric (400) was purchased from Testfabrics (West Pittston,
PA). Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) sheets (1/8″ thick, 6″
× 6″), nylon 6/6 black wing nuts, and nylon off-white
with shoulder screws (0.75″ length) were purchased from McMaster-Carr
(Douglasville, GA). Square PTFE frames were machined using an Epilog
Mini 24 laser cutting system (40 W) at the Oklahoma State University
Visual Resource Center, with a thickness of 1/8″, outer dimensions
of 6″ × 6″, and inner dimensions of 4″ ×
4″ (empty space).

Procedures
Pretreatment of Cotton
Fabric
The cotton scouring solution
was prepared by dissolving 2.50 g of NaOH, 0.75 g of Triton X-100,
and 0.38 g of citric acid in 250 mL of high purity Nanopure water
(18 Ω/cm). Five cotton swatches (7″ × 7″)
were placed in a 500 mL round-bottom flask containing 250 mL of the
scouring solution. The mixture was stirred at 100 °C for 1 h.
The scoured swatches were removed from the solution, rinsed thoroughly
with high purity water (18 Ω/cm), and dried under ambient conditions.

Synthesis of ZnO Rods on Cotton Fabric
ZnO rods were
grown on the cotton surface using a previously published protocol
by Athauda et al. A 50 mM solution of ZnO seeds was prepared by dissolving
2.75 g of Zn(CH3COO)2·2H2O in
250.0 mL of isopropanol. The resulting solution was stirred vigorously
(300 rpm) at 85 °C for 20 min. Then, 1.745 mL of triethylamine
was added dropwise to the solution and stirred at 85 °C for an
additional 15 min. This seed solution was allowed to cool to room
temperature. Pretreated cotton swatches were submerged in the seed
solution for 15 min and dried in a furnace (Binder) at 120 °C
for 1 h.

A 100 mM growth solution was made by dissolving 12.61
g of hexamethylenetetramine in 900 mL of high purity water (18 Ω/cm).
Then, 26.77 g of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O was added, and the resulting solution was stirred for 24 h at room
temperature. The ZnO growth solution was filtered (Whatman, 150 mm)
prior to use. Cotton treated with the ZnO seed solution was mounted
onto a Teflon frame, submerged in 2.7 L of growth solution in a 4
L glass tank, and kept in a furnace at 95 °C for 5 and 24 h to
generate cotton coated with ZnO short rods (13% mass loading) and
long rods (85% mass loading). The cotton was then rinsed with deionized
water and dried under ambient conditions.

Preparation of the ZnO/ZnS
Rod-Coated Cotton Samples
A 200 mM Na2S solution
was made by dissolving 43.23 g
of Na2S in 900 mL of deionized water while stirring overnight
at room temperature. Precipitates were removed using filter paper
(Whatman, 150 mm). The Na2S solution (2700 mL) was added
into a 4000 mL glass jar. The cotton swatches functionalized with
ZnO rods with 85% mass loading were mounted in a PTFE frame and submerged
in the filtered Na2S solution at 60 °C for 4 h. The
cotton was then rinsed with deionized water and dried in air.

Preparation
of the ZnO and ZnO/ZnS Microparticle-Coated Cotton
Samples
Suspensions of commercially available ZnO (24.41
g/L) and ZnS (19.49 g/L) microparticles were prepared in ethyl alcohol
and stirred at room temperature overnight. The cleaned cotton swatches
were soaked in a dispersion of colloids while stirring for 1 h followed
by drying in an oven at 120 °C for 1 h. For samples containing
ZnO + ZnS microparticles, cotton swatches were first soaked in the
suspension of ZnO and, subsequently, in a suspension of ZnS.
