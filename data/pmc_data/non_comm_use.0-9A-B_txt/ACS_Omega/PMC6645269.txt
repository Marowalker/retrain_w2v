Tungsten disulfide
(WS2) nanotubes are cylindrical,
multiwall nanotubes with various diameters and wall numbers. They
can exhibit various unique properties depending on their structures
and thus preparing samples with uniform structures is important for
understanding their basic properties and applications. However, most
synthesis methods have difficulty to prepare uniform samples, and
thus, a purification method to extract nanotubes with a selected diameter
and wall number must be developed. Here, we demonstrate a solution-based
purification of WS2 nanotubes using a surfactant solution.
Stable dispersions of nanotubes were prepared using nonionic surfactants,
which enabled us to sort the diameters and wall numbers of the nanotubes
through a centrifugation process. By optimizing the conditions, we
successfully obtained thin nanotubes with a mean diameter of 32 nm
and mean wall number of 13 with relatively small distributions. Finally,
we clarified the relationships between the structure and optical properties
of the nanotubes.

==== Body
Transition-metal dichalcogenide
(TMDC, MX2, M = Mo, W; X = S, Se) nanotubes are cylindrical
multiwall nanotubes of TMDC sheets, namely, TMDC nanotubes. Since
their discovery in 1992,1 TMDC nanotubes
have attracted much attention due to their great potential for applications,
such as high-strength polymer composite films,2−4 torsional devices,5 field effect transistors,6,7 and
thermoelectric devices.8 The performance
of such applications depends on the structures of the nanotubes, such
as the diameter and number of walls. Thin nanotubes with a small diameter
and few walls have great advantages for applications.5,9 For instance, nanotubes with a small diameter can improve mechanical
properties because they can endure a larger breaking strain.5 Additionally, theoretical studies suggested that
small diameter nanotubes have a one-dimensional band structure due
to quantum confinement,10 and we can tune
the bandgap and enhance carrier mobility.11 However, the one-dimensional nature of TMDC nanotubes has not been
revealed yet because of difficulties in the synthesis of thin nanotubes
with a uniform diameter and wall number.12−15 It is important to develop a
technique to prepare nanotubes with thin diameters in a relatively
small distribution.

In the case of nanomaterials, such as carbon
nanotubes and layered
materials, we occasionally use solution-based sorting techniques to
extract a nanomaterial with a selected structure from synthesized
samples containing materials with a wide variety of different structures.16−18 Stable dispersions in solutions are the most important factor for
sorting. There have been extensive studies on stable dispersions of
these nanomaterials;19,20 however, with regard to TMDC
nanotubes, there is no report of a successful stable dispersion except
for chemical approaches using covalent functionalization21 and defect formation,22 which damage the original properties of the TMDC nanotubes. Recently,
it was reported that nonionic surfactants can disperse MoS2 sheets in an aqueous solution by effectively lowering the density
of the surfactant-wrapped MoS2.23 Therefore, a nonionic surfactant can be a good candidate to achieve
stable dispersions of TMDC nanotubes in aqueous solutions.

In
this study, we demonstrate a method to prepare stable dispersions
of WS2 nanotubes in aqueous solutions. Through a comparison
between various dispersants, we found that nonionic surfactants are
the most appropriate surfactants for dispersions of WS2 nanotubes. A stable dispersion enables us to extract nanotubes with
small diameters by precise centrifugation control. The diameter and
wall number can be tuned by changing the applied g-force, and we successfully obtained thin nanotubes with a mean diameter
of 32 nm and mean wall number of 13 with relatively small distributions.

Experimental
Methods
To obtain a stable dispersion of WS2 nanotubes
in an
aqueous solution, effective surfactants for the WS2 nanotubes
were investigated with reference to reports on carbon nanotubes,19 graphene,20 and TMDC
sheets.24 We used the following nonionic
surfactants: poly(oxyethylene) octylphenyl ether (Triton X-100, Wako
Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.), poly(oxyethylene) sorbitan monooleate
(Tween 20 and 80, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), poly(oxyethylene-block-oxypropylene-block-oxyethylene) (Pluronic
F127 and P123, Sigma-Aldrich), poly(oxyethylene) dodecyl ether (Brij
35, Sigma-Aldrich), and poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP, Sigma-Aldrich).
For comparison, we also used the following ionic surfactants, including
anionic surfactants: sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Sigma-Aldrich),
sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS, Tokyo Chemical Industry Co.,
Ltd.), sodium cholate (SC, Sigma-Aldrich), and sodium deoxycholate
(DOC, Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd.) and cationic surfactants:
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB, Wako Pure Chemical Industries,
Ltd.) and dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB, Tokyo Chemical Industry
Co., Ltd.). WS2 nanotubes (30 mg, Nanomaterials, Ltd.,
Israel) were dispersed in each 1% surfactant solution (30 mL) using
a bath-type sonicator for 10 min. The dispersions (10 mL) were centrifuged
at 500g for 30 min using a swinging bucket rotor
(15 mL centrifugation tube) and centrifuge (LC-200, TOMY), and the
top 60% of the supernatant was collected for the following optical
measurement using a spectrometer (UV-3600, Shimadzu) with a path length
of 10 mm.

Figure 1A shows
the optical absorption spectra of the WS2 nanotubes dispersed
in different surfactant solutions. As expected, we observed significant
differences between the nonionic surfactants and other surfactants.
The dispersions using the nonionic surfactants show a much larger
optical absorption than those using the ionic surfactants, which indicates
that the nonionic surfactants can disperse the WS2 nanotubes
more effectively than the others. The relative dispersibility of the
WS2 nanotubes was estimated using the optical absorption
at ∼650 nm, which is attributed to the A-exciton transition
of the WS2 nanotubes. As shown in Figure 1B, the dispersibility significantly depends
on the types of surfactants (i.e., anionic, cationic, and nonionic).
Among them, nonionic surfactants showed the highest dispersibility
and stability. This stability of dispersions using nonionic surfactants
was confirmed by multiple measurements. The dispersions using nonionic
surfactants were preserved for more than 10 days (Figure 1C). Thus, we concluded that
nonionic surfactants are the most appropriate dispersants for WS2 nanotubes.

Such a stable dispersion
enables us to apply a solution-based purification.
Here, we used a centrifugation technique to separate nanomaterials
under the centrifugation force based on the difference in the sedimentation,
which reflects the size of the diameter and the number of walls of
the nanotubes. First, we adjusted the centrifugation conditions. We
chose Triton X-100 among the nonionic surfactants for the following
experiments because of its easy thermal removal. The removal of surfactants
is important for identifying structures by transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) techniques. The dispersions with 1% Triton X-100
(25 mL) were prepared through centrifugation at different g-forces (50–2000g) for 60 min using
a swinging bucket rotor (50 mL centrifugation tube) and centrifuge,
and the top 60% of the supernatant was collected.

We found that
the color of dispersion was changed before and after
centrifugation (Supporting Information, Figure S1). The color of pristine sample was dark, whereas that of
the centrifuged sample was yellow. This color change can be reflected
in the optical absorption. Figure 2A shows the optical absorption spectra of the WS2 nanotubes obtained at different g-forces.
We observed a clear blueshift in the A-exciton peak position with
the increase in the g-force (Figure 2B). This blueshift is similar to that observed
for the thickness sorting of TMDC sheets.23 The narrowing of the bandwidth of the A-exciton optical absorption
and the blueshift of the peak position suggest the extraction of thinner
nanotubes with improved homogeneity by centrifugation.

absorption spectra of the pristine and centrifuged WS2 nanotubes.
(B) A-exciton wavelength plotted as a function of the g-force.

To clarify this point, we tried
to identify the structure of the
samples using transmission electron microscopy. Figure 3A shows the typical TEM images of the pristine
sample and samples after 500, 1000, and 2000g (see
Supporting Information, Figure S2 for others). Figure 3B shows the histograms
of the diameter of the samples shown in Figure 3A (see Supporting Information Figure S3 for others). The pristine sample exhibited
a wide diameter distribution from 25 to 300 nm. As the g-force increased, the diameter distribution became narrower and the
mean diameter became smaller. This fact indicates an improvement in
the uniformity of the samples and thinning of the mean diameter of
the nanotubes in the sample. The mean diameter decreased as the g-force increased, and then we obtained nanotubes with a
mean diameter of 32 nm (Figure 3C). Figure 3D shows the histograms of the wall numbers of the nanotubes contained
in the samples after 500, 1000, and 2000g. We found
that the wall number also decreased as the g-force
increased, and we obtained nanotubes with a mean wall number of 13
(Figure 3E). There
is a close correlation between the diameter and wall number (inner
diameter) of the centrifuged samples (Supporting Information, Figure S4), and both the distributions became
narrow in association with the g-forces (Supporting
Information, Figure S5). On the other hand,
the length was not sorted through the centrifugation process because
the large distribution of length of nanotubes was almost the same
before and after centrifugation (Supporting Information, Figure S6). This result means that the diameter
and wall number can be sorted without serious shortening of the length.

Discussion
Here, we discuss the difference in the dispersibility
of the WS2 nanotubes with ionic and nonionic surfactants.
The density
of surfactant-wrapped WS2 nanotubes can be lowered by adsorption
of a surfactant and formation of a hydration layer, which slows their
sedimentation rate and stabilizes their dispersion. Since the water
in the hydration layer typically has the lowest density among the
components, the hydration layer thickness significantly contributes
to the decreased density. Nonionic surfactants have a relatively large
molecular hydrophilic segment (e.g., poly(ethylene oxides) for the
nonionic surfactants used in this study, except for PVP) compared
to ionic surfactants, which accompany the thick hydration layer. According
to the previous estimation for MoS2 sheets,23 even if the surface coverage by the nonionic
surfactant Pluronic (42.5%) is lower than that by ionic SC (94%),
the Pluronic surfactant can decrease the density of the surfactant-wrapped
MoS2 more than SC because of its thicker hydration layer
(20.6 nm) than that of SC (3.3 nm). It is thought that the surfactant
wrapping on WS2 nanotubes is similar to that of the sheets
because of their relatively large curvature radius. Therefore, a thick
hydration layer accompanied by nonionic surfactants would contribute
to a stable dispersion of WS2 nanotubes. This physical
background could be the reason why the nonionic surfactants are appropriate
for stable dispersions of WS2 nanotubes.

The relationships
between the structure of the WS2 nanotubes
and the A-exciton peak position were clarified in this study. Figure 4A shows the relationships
between the mean diameter, D and A-exciton peak wavelength,
λ. Here, we used the wavelength of the samples dispersed in
methanol (Supporting Information, Figure S7) that were used in the TEM observation. We found that λ logarithmically
increases with the diameter and wall number of the nanotubes, which
is consistent with the empirical raw observed in TMDC sheets.17 By fitting the data, we experimentally determined
the following relationships between D and λ.  This
equation allows us to roughly estimate
the diameter of the WS2 nanotubes from the optical measurements.
Additionally, λ is related to the bandgap of the WS2 nanotubes, and this equation suggests that the bandgap increases
with a decrease in D. This is possibly due to the
decrease in the wall number, which results in a decrease in the bandgap,
as expected theoretically.25

between the optical properties and structure of the
WS2 nanotubes. (A) A-exciton wavelength plotted as the
mean diameter. (B) A-exciton wavelength plotted as the mean wall number.

Applicable g-forces
are strongly dependent on
the used pristine sample. For this pristine sample, the obtained sample
decreased as the g-force increased and became a tiny
amount after centrifugation at 1000 and 2000g due
to sedimentation of almost all samples. However, even the sample obtained
at 2000g is still thick compared to the TMDC sheets,
when the pristine sample contains thin nanotubes more, higher g-force can be applicable.

Multistage centrifugation26 was performed
for comparison (see Supporting Information, Figure S8). Changes in the optical absorption spectra were almost
the same as the changes observed in the normal centrifugation (Figure 2A). With regard to
the A-exciton peak (Supporting Information, Figure S9) and optical absorption line shapes (Supporting Information, Figure S10), the multistage centrifugation (50g for 60 min + 100g for 60 min + 200g for 60 min + 500g for 60 min) achieved
almost the same result as that obtained by the normal centrifugation
(1000g for 60 min). Therefore, multistage centrifugation
is also available for sorting WS2 nanotubes.

Conclusions
In this study, we established how to stably disperse WS2 nanotubes using nonionic surfactants and demonstrated a method to
extract WS2 nanotubes with a relatively small diameter
and wall number through centrifugation. The nonionic surfactants result
in better dispersions than the ionic surfactants. The stable dispersion
enabled us to sort WS2 nanotubes using centrifugation techniques.
The diameter and wall number of the WS2 nanotubes gradually
decreased as the centrifugation g-force increased,
and we successfully obtained thin and uniform nanotubes with a mean
diameter of 32 nm and mean wall number of 13. Furthermore, we clarified
the relationships among the diameter, wall number, and A-exciton peak
wavelength, which enabled us to estimate the structure of the WS2 nanotubes from the optical measurements. We believe that
the preparation of thin and uniform TMDC nanotubes will play an important
role in clarifying the basic properties of WS2 nanotubes
and their electronic applications.
