The
inadequate rheological properties limit the film blowing process
of biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA), thus hindering its potential
application in environmentally friendly packaging films and mulch
films. Herein, biodegradable polyethylene glycol (PEG) and d-lactide were used to synthesize three kinds of poly-d-lactic
acid (PDLA)-b-PEG-b-PDLA (DPD) triblock
copolymers, and their effects on stereocomplex (sc) structure formation
and rheological properties of the composites were studied. The results
showed that the poly l-lactic acid (PLLA)/DPD4k sample introduced
the highest sc content, storage modulus, and complex viscosity value
compared with PLLA/DPD2k and PLLA/DPD10k at the same loading condition,
indicating that the PEG4k chains can better accelerate the formation
of a sc network between DPD4k and the PLLA matrix. The introduction of 10 wt % DPD4k also resulted in about 38 times longer relaxation
time and a strain-hardening behavior during the steady biaxial extension
of PLLA. At last, the continuous film blowing
process was successfully conducted in the PLLA/DPD4k composites, which
acquired a stable blow-up ratio of 3.07. On the basis of the above
results, the soft chain-grafted PDLA copolymer may provide a novel
method for film blowing of biodegradable PLA.

==== Body
Introduction
Renewable biobased
polylactic acid (PLA) possesses good biocompatibility,
transparency, and tensile strength, which makes it one of the most
promising biodegradable materials,1−4 especially in plastic packaging5−7 and biomedical fields.8−10 The most commonly used plastics
are packaging film and mulch film, which are almost produced by the
film blowing process that requires stretching and orientation.11 However, PLA fails to support the stable growth
of membrane bubbles in the common film blowing production because
of its poor viscoelastic response behavior.12,13 The rigid molecular structure of the PLA chain makes it difficult
to form effective molecular entanglements in the melt state, resulting
in the bad rheological performance of PLA.

Film blowing of PLA became a research focus
because of environmental protection and sustainable development. It
is a widely used approach to introduce nanofillers with physical cross-link
points to improve the melt rheological properties of PLA.14,15 However, the aggregation of nanoparticles and poor compatibility
with PLA are a big challenge to achieve good mechanical performance
and transparency. Attempts have also been made to blend poly l-lactic acid (PLLA) with other polymers16,17 and chain extenders or branched polymers,18−20 while the poor
interface compatibility and low efficiency limit the material’s
performance. Furthermore, PLA-blown films were also manufactured by
controlling the processing strategies without melt strength enhancers,21 but the low production efficiency and strict
processing window may hinder their large-scale application.

PLA’s raw material lactide has two chiral carbon atoms,
so it is possible to prepare PLLA, poly d-lactic acid (PDLA),
and meso-PLA. A unique stereocomplex (sc) structure can be formed
when blending PLLA with PDLA, which has almost 50 °C higher melting
point compared with pure PLA.22 The PLA’s
stereocrystallites (sc-PLA) and homocrystallites (hc-PLA) are two
competing crystallizations in the composites of PLLA/PDLA. The formation
of sc-PLA is preferred when the Mn of
either PLLA or PDLA is below 5000 g/mol, and the formation of hc-PLA
is preferred if the Mn of PLLA and PDLA
is higher than 100 000 g/mol.23,24 The sc structure
was proven to have strong ability in enhancing the crystallization
ability and viscosity of the PLA matrix.25−28 However, research studies on
the film blowing process of PLLA with sc-PLA are seldom reported yet.

Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is also a biodegradable polymer and has
good compatibility with PLA. The sc crystallization can be accelerated
by the PEG soft chain in PLLA/PDLA composites.29 However, the low efficiency and easy precipitation make
the addition of PEG a double-edged sword.30−33

In this study, the triblock
copolymer PDLA-b-PEG-b-PDLA (DPD)
with specified PEG and PDLA chain length was
prepared and mixed with PLLA. The Mn of the PDLA segment was designed
to be about 4000 g/mol to result
in better formation of sc-PLA. First, the chemical bonds between PEG
and PDLA chains can result in better compatibility of PEG and PLLA
and eliminate the PEG’s precipitation. Second, flexible PEG
chains in the middle of DPD copolymers can theoretically promote the
chain movement of PDLA chains to form sc crystallites, as well as
chemically tie up two or more sc crystallites together to build a
particular physical network in the matrix. Furthermore, because of
its unique network and filler effects, the sc crystallites can efficiently
enhance the viscosity and elastic response of PLLA in the melt.34−36 In this work, three kinds of DPD copolymers with different PEG chains
were prepared and mixed with PLLA to improve the thermal and rheological
performance of the PLLA matrix, thus finding application in the PLA
film blowing process.

Experimental Section
Materials
The
PLLA matrix (REVODE110, Zhejiang Hisun
Biomaterials Co., Ltd. China, Mn = 5.0
× 104 g/mol, PDI = 1.9), l-lactide and d-lactide (>99%, Jinan Daigang Co., Ltd. China), PEG2k (Mn = 2000 g/mol), PEG4k (Mn = 4000 g/mol), and PEG10k (Mn = 10 000 g/mol) (Aladdin Inc, China) were dried at 60 °C
in a vacuum oven for 24 h before use. Stannous octoate (AG, Sigma-Aldrich
Co., Ltd. China) was diluted to 0.05 mol/L with dry redistilled toluene
(Chengdu Haihong Experimental Instrument Co. Ltd. China).

Synthesis of
DPD
The triblock copolymer DPD was prepared
through ring-opening polymerization (ROP) of d-lactide with
PEG as the macroinitiator and stannous octoate as the catalyst. PEG2k,
PEG4k, and PEG10k were used to produce three kinds of DPD (DPD2k,
DPD4k, and DPD10k) with different PEG lengths. The required amounts
of the d-lactide monomer, PEG (nd-lactide/nPEG = 55.6:1),
and stannous octoate were mixed in a three-necked flask under the
nitrogen atmosphere. The obtained products were dissolved in pure
chloroform and then precipitated in ethanol after the ROP reaction
for 15 h at 150 °C. After that, the products were vacuum-filtered,
washed several times with deionized water, and then dried in a vacuum
oven for 2 days at 60 °C. By contrast, PLLA-b-PEG4k-b-PLLA (LPL4k) was also synthesized under
the same condition.

Preparation of PLLA/DPD Composites
The PLLA/DPD composites
were melt-blended by an XSS-300 Haake torque rheometer (Shanghai Kechuang
Rubber Plastics Machinery Co., Ltd. China). The composites were mixed
at 175 °C and 50 rpm for 5 min. The samples with 5 wt % of DPD2k,
DPD4k, DPD10k, and LPL4k were obtained at the same condition and labeled
as PLLA/DPD2k-5%, PLLA/DPD4k-5%, PLLA/DPD10k-5%, and PLLA/LPL4k-5%,
respectively. The samples with 2, 10, and 15 wt % of DPD4k were also
prepared and labeled as PLLA/DPD4k-2%, PLLA/DPD4k-10%, and PLLA/DPD4k-15%,
respectively.

Extrusion-Blown PLA Films
PLLA and
PLLA/DPD4k were
melt-compounded by an SHJ-20 co-rotating twin-screw extruder (Giant-China
Mechanical and Electrical Co., Ltd. Nanjing, China) at 60 rpm. The
temperature was set between 170 and 195 °C. Then, PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k
films were blown using an LSJ-10 single screw extruder (screw diameter
20 mm, L/D = 25) and an LF-250 film
blowing machine (Labtech Engineering Co., Ltd. Thailand). The film
blowing temperature of the extruder was fixed at 150–180–180–170
°C from the hopper to the die.

Characterizations
Fourier-Transform
Infrared Spectrometry
The DPD molecular
structure was characterized using a Nicolet 6700 FTIR (Nicolet Instrument
Company, USA). Samples of PEG and DPD4k were mixed with KBr powder
and pressed into sheets for Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) scanning
in the 650–4000 cm–1 wavelength range.

1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
The content
of the grafted PDLA segment in the DPD4k triblock copolymer was characterized
by 1H NMR (AV II-600 MHz, Bruker Company, Switzerland)
in deuterated chloroform (CDCl3) as the solvent with tetramethylsilane
as the internal standard.

Differential Scanning Calorimetry
Thermal analysis
of PLLA and PLLA/DPD composites was performed with differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) (Q20, TA Instruments Inc., USA) under the nitrogen
atmosphere. Each sample of 5–8 mg was heated from 30 to 160
°C at 10 °C/min and kept isothermally for 5 min to partly
eliminate thermal history and then cooled to 20 °C at the rate
of 10 °C/min and kept isothermally for 3 min, and then the sample
was reheated to 250 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min. The PLLA-blown
films were heated from 30 to 250 °C at the rate of 10 °C/min
to study the crystallinity of the films.

X-ray Diffraction Measurement
The sc crystallinity
of the PLLA/DPD composites was also tested by a Siemens-D5000 XRD
(Siemens AG, Berlin, Germany) with a Cu Kα radiation source
(λ = 0.154056 nm, 40 kV, 30 mA), and the scanning angle range
2θ was set between 5 and 80° at 3°/min.

Dynamic Rheology
Testing sheets of all samples were
compression-molded into thick disks of 25 mm diameter and 1.5 mm thickness
at 170 °C and 10 MPa pressure. The dynamic rheological properties
of PLA samples were measured using an AR2000ex rheometer (TA Instruments,
USA) at 170 °C. Each sample disk was placed in a parallel-plate
geometry, and the gap value was set as 1100 μm. The frequency
sweep test was conducted from 0.0628 to 628 rad/s at 170 °C with
a strain rate of 0.1%, which was in the linear viscoelastic region
of the composite melts.37 All the tests
were conducted under the nitrogen atmosphere.38,39

Extensional Rheology
The PLA composite
samples were
compression-molded into 17 mm × 10 mm × 1 mm under the above
conditions. The uniaxial extensional rheological properties of PLLA/DPD
composites were measured using an ARES extensional rheometer (EVF,
TA Instruments, USA) with the extensional viscosity fixture at 158.5
°C under the extensional strain rate of 0.05 s–1. The tests were also conducted under the nitrogen atmosphere.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of DPD Triblock
Copolymers
DPD was obtained through the ROP reaction of PEG
and d-lactide as shown in Scheme 1. The structure of DPD4k was characterized
by FTIR, and the
curves are presented in Figure 1a. The absorption band located at about 1750 cm–1 in DPD4k belongs to the carbonyl group of PDLA segments. The methyl
asymmetric deformation in PDLA segments was observed at about 1475
cm–1, and the peak at around 1200 cm–1 belongs to the symmetric C–O–C stretching vibration
in ester groups. The FTIR results indicated that PDLA chains were
grafted onto PEG and DPD was synthesized as expected. The 1H NMR spectra of DPD4k are shown in Figure S1; only PEG and PDLA resonances were found, consistent with the previous
report.9 The average lengths of each PDLA
segment in DPD2k, DPD4k, and DPD10k calculated by NMR results were
4029, 4135, and 3946 g/mol, respectively, which were approximately
the same length and close to our designing purpose and feeding ratio
(Table S1).

and DPD4k (a) and illustration of the sc
network formed in PLA/DPD composites (b).

Scheme 1 Illustration of the Synthesis Method of DPD
The filler effects of the sc crystallites would help improve the
melt viscosity of the composite. As flexible PEG can lead to the movement
of PLA chains in PLLA/PDLA blends and help in the formation of sc-PLA,
we hope that the PEG chain movement can directly result in better
mobility of PDLA segments through chemical bonds in our DPD structure,
thus promoting the sc arrangement of PLDA and PLLA chains. Furthermore,
sc crystallites that chemically cross-link with PEG segments and physically
cross-link with PLLA chains can effectively form more effective networks
in the matrix as shown in Figure 1b. PLLA chains around the sc crystals can not only
improve particle dispersion but also tangle with the matrix molecules
and form a widely distributed network in the matrix to achieve the
goal of melt strengthening.

sc Structure between PLLA and DPD Composites
The melting
behavior and nonisothermal crystallization of different PLLA/DPD composites
were investigated through the second heating runs by DSC, and the
results are presented in Figure 2a. The exothermal peak at 115 °C belongs to the
cold crystallization temperature (Tcc)
of the PLLA chain. It is shown from the curves that the Tcc shifts to the higher temperature after the addition
of DPD, which indicates a restriction effect of sc crystals to the
PLLA chain movement. The endothermic peaks around 153 °C corresponding
to homocrystallites (Tm-hc) can be observed
in neat PLLA, PLLA/LPL4k-5%, and PLLA/DPD composites. The endothermic
peaks at about 200 °C (Tm-sc) appeared
only in PLLA/DPD composites, which can be assigned to the PLLA and
DPD’s PLDA segments formed by the sc structure. Among the three
PLLA/DPD samples with 5% addition, the Tm-sc of PLLA/DPD4k-5% has the highest melt temperature and peak value,
followed by the PLLA/DPD2k-5% and PLLA/DPD10k-5% samples. The reason
can be inferred that the PEG2k chain is not flexible enough to help
acquire much sc crystals under this condition and that the PEG10k
chain is long enough but has a smaller proportion of PDLA segments,
which can form few sc crystals. In the PLLA/DPD4k-5% sample, the chain
of PEG4k is flexible enough to promote the PDLA chain movement, and
the proportion of the PDLA segment is enough to acquire sc crystals,
which contributes to numerous stable sc structures with higher melting
temperature.

Figure 2 DSC heating curves of PLLA with 5% different additives
(a) and
PLLA with different DPD4k addition amounts (b).

Because DPD4k can help in better formation of stable sc structures,
the detailed information about the thermal properties of PLLA/DPD4k
composites in different addition amounts were also studied through
the second heating runs of DSC, and the results are shown in Figure 2b and Table 1. The Tcc of the homocrystallite shifts from 115 °C to about
125 °C after DPD4k addition, indicating that the homocrystallites
are suppressed by sc crystallization. The melting peaks of sc crystallites
occurred at about 200 °C when adding DPD4k to the PLLA matrix.
With the DPD4K copolymer addition increased from 2 to 15%, the crystallinity
of sc (Xc-sc) increases from 1.19 to 10.57%.
The Xc-sc was also calculated by
X-ray diffraction (XRD, Figure S2), and
the results were listed below. The sc crystallinity of PLA samples
was calculated by the following equation40 1

Relaxation Behavior of the PLLA/DPD Composites
The
interfacial interaction between polymer chains can be evaluated with
the variation of rheological parameters such as storage modulus, loss
modulus, and complex viscosity.41 As shown
in previous studies, the melt temperature of the sc crystallite is
about 50 °C higher than that of pure PLA. In melt processing
at suitable temperature, the sc crystallites introduced to PLLA can
act as an effective rheological enhancer to enhance the elastic response
and viscosity because of the filler effects and cross-linking effects
of the sc network.42−44

To study the impact of DPD on the rheological
behaviors of the PLLA matrix, the frequency sweep experiments of PLLA/DPD
composites were carried out at 170 °C. Figure 3 demonstrates the storage modulus (Figure 3a), loss modulus
(Figure 3b), and complex
viscosity (Figure 3c) change of PLLA with 5% different triblock copolymers. The results
of PLLA/LPL4k-5% are almost the same as that of neat PLLA, while the
storage, loss modulus, and complex viscosity values increased a lot
by the addition of 5% DPD copolymers. Among these samples, PLLA/DPD4k-5%
shows the largest increase, followed by PLLA/DPD10k-5% and PLLA/DPD2k-5%.
The order of improvement degree is consistent with the order of Xc-sc amount in each group. The main difference
between DPD4k and LPL4k is that DPD can form sc with PLLA chains.
Thus, the sc structure is the key factor that resulted in melt viscosity
improvement. The higher storage, loss modulus, and viscosity value
can be mainly ascribed to the strong interaction of the sc network
between the DPD chains and the PLLA matrix.

Figure 3 Dependence of storage
modulus (a), loss modulus (b), and complex
viscosity (c) of PLLA with 5% different copolymers and storage modulus
(a′), loss modulus (b′), and the dependence complex
viscosity (c′) of PLLA with different contents of the DPD4k
copolymer at 170 °C as a function of frequency.

The low-viscosity character of PLA has a negative impact
on its
processing such as extrusion processing and blow molding. DPD4k can
better enhance the rheological viscosity of the PLLA melt, thus the
PLLA/DPD4k composites with different addition amounts were studied.
The storage (Figure 3a′), loss modulus (Figure 3b′), and complex viscosity (Figure 3c′) have been enhanced
significantly with an increase in the DPD4k copolymer addition. When
the addition amount of DPD4k increases to 10 wt %, it can be seen
that the G′ of the system is less dependent
on the change at low frequency from 0.01 to 0.1 Hz, which deviates
greatly from the behavior of PLA, indicating that the material shows
a solidlike behavior. The storage modulus increases about 2 orders
of magnitude under low shear frequency and about 4 times under high
shear frequency as shown in Table 2, indicating a strong and stable sc network existing
in the composites, which helps to increase the melt stability of the
material. Complex viscosity of the polymer is also an important parameter
to characterize its rheological properties. PLA has a low shear viscosity
because of its low entanglement density; the formation of the sc network
also increased the complex viscosity of the polymer from low shear
frequency to high shear frequency with the addition of DPD4k, which
will help to increase the stability of PLA’s melt processing.

The melt strength of
a polymer is strongly related to its molecular
entanglements and relaxation. Increasing the polymer entanglement
density and the maximum relaxation time of polymer molecular chains
can improve the tensile viscosity of the polymer. Polymer’s
relaxation behavior can be obtained from the weighted relaxation spectrum
(τH(τ)), which is related to its intrinsic
characteristics. PLLA/DPD4k composite relaxation behavior is studied
by the continuous weighted relaxation spectrum (τH(τ)) calculated with the storage modulus and loss modulus value
obtained through frequency sweep testing.32 The continuous relaxation time spectrum of the materials can be
obtained by eqs 2a and 2b listed below. In eqs 2a and 2b, ω represents the
angular frequency, τ represents the relaxation time, and H(τ) represents the relaxation time spectrum. 2a   2b  

The relaxation time spectra of the samples obtained based
on the
frequency sweep results are shown in Figure 4a. The values of the largest relaxation time
and peak intensity are listed in Table 3. The longest relaxation time of PLLA assigned to free
PLLA molecular segments or chain movement is found within the range
of 0.026 s, which indicates that pure PLLA chains lack entanglements
and relax quickly. After the introduction of DPD4k chains, the intensity
of the relaxation spectrum was improved remarkably and the longest
relaxation peak extends to longer time with the increasing DPD4k content.
The longest relaxation time of PLLA/DPD4k-10% extends about 27 times
from 0.026 to 0.695 s, and the intensity under the largest relaxation
time increases about 37 times from 300 to 11 176 Pa s compared
with pure PLLA sample. Meanwhile, the range of the relaxation peak
is much larger with the addition of DPD4k, indicating a broader processing
window of the composites. A solidlike phenomenon
is observed in the PLLA/DPD4k-15% sample, and a relaxation peak is
not observed because of a large number of sc network structures. Sc
crystallites that chemically cross-link with PEG chain segments and
physically cross-link with PLLA chains can effectively form an effective
network in the matrix. The sc network between PLLA and DPD4k chains,
along with the interaction between the sc particles and the PLLA matrix,
inhibits the PLLA chain movement, thus resulting in better melt stability
and broadening the processing window of the composites.

In the film blowing process, the effect of stretching field is
of significant importance, and the tensile rheological properties
are instructive for the film blowing process of PLLA. Therefore, the
extensional rheological properties of PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k composites
were studied by the extensional rheology, and the results are displayed
in Figure 4b and Table 3. The elongation viscosity
of the composites is markedly improved with the addition of DPD4k.
The elongation viscosity of pure PLLA melt increases a little with
the increase of tensile time and becomes steady after a short time.
However, the elongational viscosity was significantly enhanced with
the increasing addition of DPD4k. A strain-hardening behavior can
be observed when the DPD content exceeds 5%, which can be attributed
to the entanglement of sc structures between DPD4k and PLLA. This
has a good effect on improving the biaxial tensile stability of the
melt in the film blowing process.

Film Blowing Process of
PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k-10% Composites
PLA can be potentially
applied in the fields of biodegradable packaging
and mulch films, which are mainly manufactured through the film blowing
process. The bubble stability affected by the melt strength is very
important to conduct continuous production of the film blowing process.
The low melt strength of pure PLA can hardly meet the requirements, thus
many previous studies have chosen to add some nanocomposites or plasticizers
to help in the film blowing of PLA.45 In
this study, we found that the purpose-designed DPD chains can form
sc networks with PLLA chains, resulting in enhanced rheological properties
of the PLLA/DPD composites.

To test the film blowing effect
of our DPD products, 10 wt % DPD4k was introduced to improve the film
blowing properties of the PLLA matrix. Figures 5 and S3 show the
film blowing bubbles of neat PLLA (Figure 5a) and PLLA/DPD4k-10% (Figure 5b). The bubble of neat PLLA is unstable in
shape, uneven in thickness at about 80–100 μm, and easy
to burst, leading to production interruption and high cost of film
production. However, the bubble of PLLA/DPD4k-10% composites is very
stable and of uniform thickness, which achieves the continuous film
blowing production and reduces the production cost. At the same time,
the blow-up ratio of the PLLA/DPD4k-10% bubble reaches 3.07 with a
film thickness of about 50 μm, which meets the demand of industrial
production. Both PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k films were highly transparent,
which can potentially be used as packaging and mulch films.

Features of PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k-10%
Blown Films
The DSC heating scans of two blown films are
shown in Figure 6a.
The specific sc melting temperature at about 190 °C shows the
biggest difference between the PLLA film and the PLLA/DPD4k-10% film.
The crystallinity of hc-PLA increases from 0.65 to 2.33%, indicating
that during the processing a significant amount of crystals was formed
in the presence of DPD4k. Figure 6b,c shows that the transparency of PLLA is not damaged
with the introduction of DPD4k. The morphology of brittle fracture
face of blown films was also studied using SEM (as shown in Figure 6d,e). In general,
both the PLLA and PLLA/DPD4k-10% films show a smooth surface, which
indicates that DPD4k can be well dispersed in PLLA and has good compatibility
with the matrix.

Conclusions
In
this work, a comparative study was carried out in PLLA/DPD2k,
PLLA/DPD4k, PLLA/DPD10k, and PLLA/LPL4k samples to investigate the
effect of PEG length and sc crystallites on the melt strength of the
PLLA matrix. The DPD4k products can better form more sc networks with
the PLLA matrix and also has the best ability in improving the viscosity
and relaxation time of the composite. The unique network generated
among the PEG segments, PDLA segments, and PLLA chains demonstrated
an obvious effect in improving the melt strength of PLLA.

The
improvement in melt strength in the PLLA/DPD composites is
associated with the entanglement of sc networks with the PLLA matrix.
Such a significant increase in melt viscosity and relaxation time
facilitated the PLLA film blowing, which requires high viscosity and
molecular entanglements to maintain the shape of blown bubbles. In
the film blowing process, the PLLA/DPD4k-10% composites can acquire
stable blown bubbles and meet the requirement of the continuous film
blowing process. The resulted materials have great potential in green
packaging materials such as disposable containers, agricultural films,
and so forth.
