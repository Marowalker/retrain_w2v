sulfonated polytriazole copolymers (PTSQSH-I to IV) with IECw values ranging from 2.41 to 3.49 mequiv g–1. The
copolymers were synthesized by click reaction between equimolar amount
of a dialkyne monomer, potassium 2,5-bis(2-propyn-1-yloxy)benzenesulfonate,
and a mixture of two different diazide monomers, 4,4-bis[3′-trifluoromethyl-4′(4-azidobenzoxy)benzyl]biphenyl
and 4,4′-diazido-2,2′-stilbene disulfonic acid disodium
salt. The copolymers were characterized by Fourier transform infrared
and NMR spectroscopy techniques. The membranes were prepared by dissolving
the salt form of the copolymers in dimethyl sulfoxide. The copolymers
showed high thermal, mechanical, and oxidative stabilities, and the
acidified membranes showed very high proton conductivity (43–173
and 132–304 mS cm–1 at 30 and 80 °C,
respectively). Transmission electron microscopy images confirmed the
formation of well-phase-separated morphology with interconnected hydrophilic
domains (20–150 nm).

Introduction
The last few decades have witnessed a
remarkable growth on proton
exchange membrane (PEM) materials as an alternative to sulfonated
perfluoro copolymers, for example, Nafion 117, Aciplex, and Flemion.1−4 In this context, a variety of proton exchange membranes (PEMs) based
on sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)s,5−7 sulfonated poly(arylene
ether ketone)s,8−10 sulfonated poly(arylene thioether sulfone)s,11,12 sulfonated copolyimides,13−16 and sulfonated poly(benzimidazole)s17−19 have been prepared and their properties have been studied.

The copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne click (CuAAC) reactions
were extensively studied in organic synthesis because of their outstanding
features, for example, versatility, high efficiency, regioselectivity,
functional group tolerance, easy product isolation, and high yields.20,21 Because of all of these unique features, the click reactions were
extended to the synthesis of polymers and accordingly several linear,
hyperbranched, graft, and cross-linked polymers were prepared.22−28 Recently, the CuAAC reaction was used for the synthesis of PEM materials.29−36 The proton conductivity of a PEM material is associated with a combination
of ion exchange capacity (IECw) or degree of sulfonation
(DS) and the interconnected phase-separated morphology.34 Typically, high IECw values always
result in high proton conductivity; however, they have a negative
effect on dimensional swelling and mechanical properties of membranes.
Moreover, high IECw values also increase the fuel permeability.34 Crosslinking is an effective method for the
reduction of dimensional swelling; however, it sometimes results in
brittle and insoluble membranes.34 These
problems can be resolved by the introduction of fluorine in the polymer
backbone. This approach improves not only the processability of the
polymers but also their thermal, chemical, and swelling properties.1 In addition, fluorine also helps in the formation
of phase-separated morphology, which helps in improving proton conductivity
of the membranes.37 Therefore, in recent
years, several classes of fluorinated sulfonated copolymers have been
prepared that showed improved proton conductivity and dimensional
stability.38−44 In the search of new PEM materials, we have already reported several
new fluorinated sulfonated copolytriazoles (Scheme 1), and their detailed properties have been
investigated.30−35

Scheme 1 Chemical Structures of Various Sulfonated Polytriazoles Reported
Earlier
In the present work,
we targeted to increase the IECw values of polymers and
to study their properties. Accordingly, a
low-molar-mass sulfonated dialkyne monomer, potassium 2,5-bis(2-propyn-1-yloxy)benzenesulfonate
(TS), was synthesized and a new set of polytriazoles was prepared
using two different diazide monomers, 4,4-bis[3′-trifluoromethyl-4′(4-azidobenzoxy)benzyl]biphenyl
(QAZ) and 4,4′-diazido-2,2′-stilbene disulfonic acid
disodium salt (SAZ). The additional sulfonic acid group in the dialkyne
monomer resulted in high IECw value copolytriazoles (Scheme 2) compared with analogous
copolymers with the same DS values.30−35

Scheme 2 Chemical Structure of the Polytriazole
The PEM properties of the copolytriazoles, such as proton
conductivity,
water uptake (WU), swelling ratio, oxidation and mechanical stability,
and morphology, were studied and were compared to those of the analogous
copolytriazoles.29−35

Results and Discussion
Synthesis of Monomers
A sulfonated
dialkyne (TS) monomer
was prepared from potassium salt of hydroquinone sulfonic acid and
propargyl bromide as shown in Scheme 3.

Scheme 3 Reaction Scheme for the Synthesis of Potassium 2,5-Bis(2-propyn-1-yloxy)benzenesulfonate
(TS)
The structure of TS was confirmed
by Fourier transform infrared
(FTIR) and NMR spectroscopy techniques. The absorption bands at 3293
cm–1 (strong) and 2123 cm–1 (weak)
in the FTIR spectrum (Figure 1) of the TS monomer were assigned to the characteristic of
stretching of ≡C–H and C≡C bonds, respectively.34 In the proton NMR spectrum, the acetylenic and
propargylic protons appeared at 3.51 and 4.74 ppm and the aromatic
protons were found between 6.96 and 7.35 ppm. The fluorinated diazide
monomer (QAZ) was synthesized according to the previously reported
procedure and was characterized by FTIR and NMR spectroscopic techniques.30 The FTIR spectra of QAZ in the range of 600–4000
cm–1 are given in Figure 1 for better realization of the polymer formation
through the azide–alkyne click reaction.

and PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers.

Synthesis and Characterization of Sulfonated Copolytriazoles
The sulfonated polytriazole copolymers (PTSQSH-I to IV) were synthesized
by click polymerization of TS, SAZ, and QAZ, shown in Scheme 4. The salt and acid forms of
the copolymers are reported as PTSQS-I to IV and PTSQSH-I to IV, respectively.

Scheme 4 Reaction Scheme for the Synthesis of PTSQSH-I to IV Copolymers
The copolymers of different
degree of sulfonation (DS) were prepared
by varying the molar ratio of the diazide monomers (SAZ to QAZ), i.e., n/n – 1. The copolymers (both salt
form and acid form) were soluble in several common organic solvents,
such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethylacetamide (DMAc), at
a polymer concentration of ∼5% (w/v) and were insoluble in
tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane, methanol, and water. The solution-cast
membranes were prepared from the copolymers using DMSO as the solvent,
and the acid form of the membranes was obtained after acidification
of the membranes. The thickness of the acidified membranes was between
55 and 65 μm. The molecular weight, inherent viscosity, and
degree of sulfonation (DS) are listed in Table 1, indicating the formation of high-molar-mass
polymers.

The
FTIR spectra of monomers and PTSQSH-I copolymer as one of the
representatives are shown in Figure 1. It can be found that the absorption bands at 3293
cm–1 (≡C–H), 2123 cm–1 (C≡C), and 2119 cm–1 (−N=N=N)
disappear after the polymerization reaction, indicating the high conversion
of the monomers. In addition, the bands at 1334 and 1484 cm–1 are the characteristics of aromatic asymmetric C–O–C
stretching, and the band at around 1051 cm–1 corresponds
to the symmetric C–O–C stretching.39,40 The band at around 1124 cm–1 is due to the C–F
stretching, and two bands at around 1020 and 1085 cm–1 are due to asymmetric and symmetric stretching of −SO3H groups, respectively.39,40 These results support
the formation of sulfonated copolymers by click polymerization.

The chemical structures and compositions of the PTSQS-I to IV copolymers
were confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy.30,31 The 1H NMR spectrum of the salt form of PTSQS-I is shown
in Figure 2. The peaks
at around 8.92 ppm correspond to the aromatic protons (H1 and H7) of the triazole moieties.30,31 The peaks at around 8.35 and 8.26 ppm correspond to the H5 and H17 protons of the hydroquinone sulfonic acid potassium
salt (TS) and stilbene disulfonic acid sodium salt (S) moieties, respectively.30,31 All protons in the copolymers are well assigned, which suggests
that the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers are successfully synthesized by
copper(I)-catalyzed azide–alkyne click chemistry (CuAAC) polymerization
reactions. Furthermore, the chemical composition and degree of sulfonation
of the copolymers were determined using the peak integration values30,31 in the regions I1–I2–I3 (Figure 2), and the values are presented
in Table 1.

Thermal Studies
Thermal behavior of the copolymers
was studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning
calorimetry (DSC) techniques. All TGA experiments were carried out
under a synthetic air environment. TGA thermograms for the acidified
membranes with different compositions are shown in Figure 3, and the 10% weight loss temperature
(Td10) was in the range of 243–254
°C (Table 2).
The copolymers showed two-step degradation, the initial weight loss
at approximately 185–270 °C was due to the loss of the
−SO3H groups and the second weight loss at around
270–360 °C was a result of degradation of the main triazole
backbone. None of these polymers showed any transition in DSC till
their degradation temperature, which is typical of the sulfonic acid
group containing polymers and attributed to the strong ionic interactions
of the sulfonic acid groups.1,38

Mechanical and Oxidative Stability
The stress–strain
plots for the PTSQSH-I to IV membranes (dry form) are shown in Figure 4, and the results
are summarized in Table 2. PTSQSH-I to IV membranes showed higher tensile strength (30–51
MPa) in contrast to Nafion 117 (tensile strength, 22 MPa).42 Young’s moduli for all membranes were
also higher (1.25–2.02 GPa) than those of Nafion 117 (0.16
GPa). However, the elongation at break of PTSQSH-I to IV membranes
was lower (9–14%) than that of Nafion 117 (200%).42

in dry state.

The oxidative stability
of the membranes was checked by putting
them into Fenton’s reagent (2 ppm of iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate
in 3% hydrogen peroxide) at 80 °C. The time taken to dissolve
the membranes was accounted as their oxidative stability (τ).30,39 Similar to the previous studies, the oxidative stabilities of the
PTSQSH-I to IV membranes decreased with the increase of the DS values.30−35 As shown in Table 2, the oxidative stability of the copolymers decreases with the decrease
in the molar concentration of the QAZ monomer (or DS increases). However,
PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers in the current work showed oxidative stability
similar to that of the previously reported QAZ-based copolymers (PTFQSH-XX, PTAQSH-XX, and PTNQSH-XX) with the same DS values.30,31,36

Ion Exchange Capacity, Water Uptake, and Swelling Ratio
The theoretical IECw of the copolymers was calculated
from the molecular weight of the repeat unit structure, whereas the
experimental IECw was determined by 1H NMR and
titrimetric analyses.30,31 In this work, a sulfonated dialkyne
monomer (TS) was used to increase the IECw, and at the
same time, the nonsulfonated diazide monomer (QAZ) with high mole
percentage (50–80 mol %) was used to increase the fluorine
percentage of the copolymers. This resulted in an increase in IECw from 1.66–2.82 to 2.41–3.49 mequiv g–1 and fluorine percentage from 1.68–6.08 to 3.06–6.85%
of the copolymers (Table 3) in comparison to those for structurally similar copolymers
PTHQSH-XX.34 As shown
in Table 3, the IECw values for the PTSQSH-I to IV copolytriazoles obtained from
titrimetric and 1H NMR analyses were in compliance with
the theoretical values. This also supported that −SO3H-containing monomers (SAZ and TS) were successfully incorporated
in the polymer chain by the CuAAC reaction.

where DSNMR is calculated from NMR signal intensity.

The volumetric ion exchange capacity
(IECv) of the copolymers
in dry and wet states was also determined by the multiplication of
IECw with the respective density values of the membranes.30,31 The results are listed in Table 3. The weight-based water uptake (WUw), volume-based
water uptake (WUv), and number of water molecules per −SO3H group (λ) of the copolymers were measured according
to earlier reports.30,42 The water uptake and proton conductivity
of the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers as a function of IECw are
shown in Figure 5a,b.
The water uptake (wt %) and proton conductivity of the copolymers
gradually increased with IECw and temperature because of
increased hydrophilic segments. The WUw of the PTSQSH-I
to IV copolymers was higher than that of other types of structurally
comparable copolymers because of the high IECw values of
the copolymers.29−35 The volume-based water uptake (WUv) of PTSQSH-I to IV
copolymers as a function of IECv(dry), IECv(wet),
and temperature (30 and 80 °C) is presented in Figure 6a,b. The IECv(wet)
represents the concentration of total protons within the polymer matrix
under wet conditions. It is evident from Figure 6a that IECv(dry) of the copolymers
displays a similar trend as in the case of IECw in Figure 5a. However, Figure 6b shows a different
trend because of high water uptake (vol %) and reduced IECv (wet).

and (b) IECv(wet) values of PTSQSH-I to IV membranes.

The hydration number (λ)
is the number of absorbed water
molecules per −SO3H group in the ionomer, and it
is directly related to IECw, WUw, and temperature.29−31 It can be observed from Tables 3 and 4 the that hydration number
increases with IECw and temperature, and as a consequence,
proton conductivity increases.

The
swelling ratio (length and thickness) of the PTSQSH-I to IV
membranes was measured according to the previous reports.30−32 The swelling ratios of the PTSQSH-I to IV membranes show a similar
trend to that of water uptake values and depend on the degree of sulfonation
as well as fluorine content (Table 3) in the copolymers. The swelling ratio of the copolymers
increased with the increase in IECw value and temperature
(Table 4), and these
values were higher than those of similar type of copolymers due to
the higher hydration number (Table 4).30−34

Proton Conductivity Measurement
The proton conductivity
of the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers was measured using alternating current
impedance spectroscopy. Before the measurement of proton conductivity,
all of the copolymers were equilibrated in deionized water for 72
h. The resistance of the copolymers was measured from the Nyquist
plot from the higher-frequency intercept of the characteristic semicircle
on the real axis. Figure 7a displays a typical Nyquist plot for the PTSQSH-I copolymer
at different temperatures, and the resistance of the copolymer regularly
decreased with the increase in temperature. Figure 7b displays the proton conductivity values
of all copolymers as a function of temperature.

Figure 7 (a) Impedance behavior
of PTSQSH-I as function of temperature and
(b) proton conductivity as a function of temperature for PTSQSH-I
to IV.

The proton conductivity values
of all copolymers are presented
in Table 3. The proton
conductivity values for PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers were in the range
of 43–173 mS cm–1 at 30 °C and
132–304 mS cm–1 at 80 °C, and these
values were considerably higher in comparison to those of the similar
type of copolymers due to their higher IECw values (2.41–3.49
mequiv g–1).29−36 The proton conductivity values of PTSQSH-I (IECw = 2.41
mequiv g–1, σ = 132 mS cm–1 at 80 °C) and PTSQSH-III (IECw = 3.10 mequiv g–1, σ = 249 mS cm–1 at 80 °C)
were higher than or comparable to those of the analogous copolymers
with similar DS values, i.e., PTASH-100 (IECw = 2.86 mequiv
g–1, σ = 112 mS cm–1 at
80 °C), PTFSH-100 (IECw = 2.40 mequiv g–1, σ = 136 mS cm–1 at 80 °C), SPTA3 (IECw = 2.86 mequiv g–1, σ = 149 mS cm–1 at 80 °C), PTESH-100 (IECw = 3.38
mequiv g–1, σ = 215 mS cm–1 at 80 °C), and Nafion 117 (IECw = 0.91 mequiv g–1, σ = 135 mS cm–1 at 80 °C).29−31,35 The higher fluorine content in
the PTSQSH-I (6.85%) and PTSQSH-II (5.68%) copolymers generates polarity
difference in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains in the polymer,
which resulted in better phase-separated morphology and high proton
conductivity compared to those for PTASH-100 and many other sulfonated
polymers.1,31,37

The
activation energy for proton conduction was calculated from
the slopes of the different lines in Figure 8 using the Arrhenius equation. The activation
energy values for the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers were in the range
of 9.9–20.9 kJ mol–1, and these values were
comparable to those of the analogous copolymers.30,32,35,36

for proton conduction of the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers.

Microstructure Analysis
The proton
conductivity and
water absorbing ability of sulfonated polymers are in relation to
the phase separation between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains
of the sulfonated polymers.1,37 The microstructural
analysis of the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers was carried out by scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The STEM micrographs of cross-sectioned
lead (Pb2+)-stained membranes are presented in Figure 9. The dark ionic
domains in the micrographs represent hydrophilic domains, and these
ionic domains are mainly responsible for proton transport. On the
other hand, bright regions correspond to the hydrophobic domains,
and these regions are responsible for mechanical and dimensional stabilities.
The micrographs showed smaller and interconnected ionic clusters (20–45
nm) in the case of PTSQSH-I to III membranes. However, a large number
of bigger and interconnected ionic clusters (50–150 nm) were
seen in the PTSQSH-IV membrane, which is indicating the presence of
very large numbers of aggregated −SO3H groups that
formed an extensive hydrophilic domain. The PTSQSH-I to IV membranes
showed interconnected ionic channels in all of the cases and therefore
the proton conductivity, water uptake, and swelling ratio values were
higher in comparison to those of the other type of sulfonated copolytriazoles.30−36

Conclusions
In
this work, we have successfully prepared a series of highly
sulfonated fluorinated copolytriazoles (PTSQSH-I to IV) by copper-catalyzed
click polymerization of equimolar amount of a sulfonated dialkyne
(TS) monomer with two different diazide monomers, fluorinated diazide
QAZ and sulfonated diazide SAZ. The structural elucidation of the
copolymers was performed by FTIR and NMR spectroscopy techniques.
The copolymers were thermally stable up to 245 °C with 10% weight
loss under synthetic air and showed the ability to form mechanically
robust membranes even at very high degree of sulfonation when DMSO
was used as a casting solvent. The dry copolymer membranes displayed
tensile strength between 30 and 51 MPa and tensile modulus between
1.25 and 2.02 GPa depending on the exact degree of sulfonation. These
values are reasonably higher than those of Nafion 117 (tensile strength
22 MPa, tensile modulus 0.16 GPa). The high IECw values
(2.41–3.49 mequiv g–1) of PTSQSH-I to IV
copolymers are attributed to their high proton conductivity (135–304
mS cm–1 at 80 °C). Microstructure analysis
of the PTSQSH-I to IV copolymers showed well-phase-separated morphology
with interconnected hydrophilic domains, contributing to high proton
conductivity. Therefore, the incorporation of additional −SO3H groups through the dialkyne monomer helped improve many
of the PEM properties of the prepared copolytriazoles. Considering
all of the PEM properties, e.g., thermal stability (10% weight loss
temperature = 249 °C), mechanical strength (tensile strength
= 36 MPa, Young’s modulus = 1.31 GPa), oxidative stability
(more than 24 h), and proton conductivity (173 mS cm–1 at 80 °C), PTSQSH-II was the best in the series.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Propargyl bromide (80 wt % solution in toluene)
and 4,4′-diazido-2,2′-stilbene disulfonic acid disodium
salt (≥99.0%) (SAZ) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and
used as received. Hydroquinone sulfonic acid potassium salt (>98%)
was purchased from Alfa Aesar, India. Copper(I) iodide (>99%),
acetone,
potassium carbonate, and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased
from Spectrochem, India. Potassium carbonate was dried at 120 °C
for overnight before use. DMSO and acetone were distilled prior to
use. Concentrated sulfuric acid (95%) and ammonia solution were purchased
from E. Merck, India. 4,4-Bis[3′-trifluoromethyl-4′(4-azidobenzoxy)benzyl]biphenyl
(QAZ) was synthesized according to the earlier reported procedure.30

Synthesis of Potassium 2,5-Bis(2-propyn-1-yloxy)benzenesulfonate
(TS)
A 250 mL three-necked round bottom flask equipped with
a nitrogen inlet, refluxing condenser, and magnetic stirrer was charged
with hydroquinone sulfonic acid (5 g, 21.90 mmol), potassium carbonate
(12.1 g, 87.5 mmol), and 150 mL of DMF, and the reaction mixture was
stirred for 2 h. Propargyl bromide (10.40 g, 87.06 mmol) was added
dropwise to this reaction mixture over a period of 2 h, and the reaction
was continued for 60 h at 80 °C. The reaction mixture was filtered,
and the filtrate was precipitated in 250 mL of acetone. The yellow
precipitate was filtered and dried at 80 °C for 24 h. The product
was recrystallized using ethanol and deionized water.29 Yield: 5.5 g (∼80%). Anal. Calcd. for C12H9KO5S (304.36 g mol–1):
C, 47.35%; H, 2.98%; found: C, 47.33%, H, 2.96%. FTIR (KBr): 3280
(≡C–H), 2135 (C≡C), 1017, 1048, and 1082 cm–1 (−SO3K), 1H NMR (DMSO-d6), ppm: 7.35 (H3, 1H), 7.04 (H5, 1H), 6.96 (H4, 1H), 4.74 (H2, 4H),
3.51 (H1, 2H).

Synthesis of Sulfonated Copolytriazoles (PTSQS-I
to IV)
As an example, the preparation of PTSQS-I is described
here: QAZ
(0.3973 g, 0.56 mmol), TS (0.3412 g, 1.12 mmol), SAZ (0.3019 g, 0.56
mmol), and 5 mol % CuI (0.010 g, 0.056 mmol) were placed in a 50 mL
flame-dried three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a magnetic
stirrer, reflux condenser, and N2 inlet. DMSO (12 mL) was
added to the flask, and the reaction mixture was heated to 70 °C
for 12 h. During this period, there was a dramatic increase in the
viscosity of the reaction medium. The reaction solution was cooled
to room temperature and was precipitated in excess isopropanol. The
fibrous precipitate obtained was isolated by filtration and washed
several times in 20% ammonia solution followed by deionized water
and dried under vacuum at 100 °C for overnight. The yield was
98%. The NMR data of PTSQS-I to IV copolymers in salt form: 1H NMR (DMSO-d6, 30 °C), ppm: 8.91
(H1,7), 8.36 (H5), 8.26 (H17), 8.07
(H12,18), 7.97 (H8), 7.87 (H13,14,15,16), 7.45 (H11), 7.32 (H9,10), 7.17–7.07
(H3,4), 5.29–5.18 (H2,6).

Membrane Preparation
and Acidification
The membranes
were prepared using the polymer solutions in DMSO at a concentration
of 10% w/v. The polymer solutions were filtered and cast in flat-bottom
Petri dishes. The Petri dishes were heated at 80 °C inside an
oven for overnight for slow removal of the solvent. Afterward, the
oven temperature was preset according to the following heating order:
100 °C (4 h), 120 °C (2 h), 140 °C (2 h), and 155 °C
(1 h). The membranes were further heated under vacuum at 120 °C
for 24 h for removal of any residual solvent. The oven temperature
was brought down to room temperature, and the Petri dishes were put
into boiling water to remove the membranes. The salt form of the membranes
was acidified by putting them in 1.5 M H2SO4 solution for 24 h. The acidified membranes were washed a number
of times with deionized water to ensure complete removal of any surface-absorbed
acid (H2SO4). Finally, the membranes were dried
at 100 °C for 24 h under vacuum and yellow membranes of thickness
between 55 and 65 μm were obtained.

Measurements and Characterization
A 600 MHz NMR instrument,
Bruker instrument (Switzerland), was used to record the 1H NMR spectra of the monomers and polymers. Deuterated DMSO-d6 or CDCl3 and tetramethylsilane
were used as solvents and internal standard, respectively. Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded using a NEXUS 870
FTIR instrument, Thermo Nicolet. The molecular weight of the copolymers
(salt form) was determined via gel permeation chromatography using
DMAc with 3 g L–1 LiCl as an eluent. The apparatus
consists of an Agilent 1200 series high-performance liquid chromatography
pump (Agilent Technologies), a PolarGel-M column, and a refractive
index K2301 (Knauer, Germany) detector. Linear poly(methyl methacrylate)
with molecular weight between 500 and 1 000 000 Da was
used for calibration purpose. Thermal stability of the membranes was
studied using a TGA instrument, TGA Q50 (TA Instruments). The experiments
were conducted in a synthetic air mixture atmosphere (N2/O2 = 80:20) at a heating rate of 10 K min–1. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) measurements were carried
out using a DSC Q20 instrument (TA Instruments) at a heating rate
of 10 K min–1 under nitrogen. A FEI-TECNAI G2 20
S-TWIN transmittance electron microscope (TEM) was used to obtain
the TEM micrographs of the lead-stained membranes operated at an accelerating
voltage of 120 kV. The mechanical behavior of the dry acidified membranes
was checked using a tensile testing machine manufactured by Tinius
Olsen, U.K., model no. H5KS. The test specimens of width 10 mm, length
63 mm, and thickness 50–65 μm were used, and the measurements
were performed in tension mode at a test speed of 5 mm min–1 at ambient temperature (∼32 °C). Water uptake, dimensional
change, and oxidative stability of the polymer membranes were checked
according to the reported procedure.30,40 The ion exchange
capacity (IECw) was calculated from the following formula:
IECw = (1000/Mw) × DS
× 2, where Mw and DS are the molecular
weight of the repeat unit and degree of sulfonation, respectively,
which was experimentally determined by the titrimetric method.38 The DS values were determined from 1H NMR signal integrals and were also used to calculate the IECw of the copolymers.30 Volume-based
ion exchange capacity (IECv) values were calculated in
the dry state of the copolymers by multiplying the corresponding IECw values with their densities. Similarly, IECv values
of the wet state were calculated from the water uptake values of the
corresponding copolymers.30,40 Proton conductivity
(in-plane) of the hydrated membranes (10 mm × 20 mm × 55–65
μm) was determined using the following equation: σ = l/(R × A), where
σ, l, R, and A are the in-plane proton conductivity, distance between the two electrodes,
resistance, and area of the sample, respectively. A GAMRY reference
3000, impedance analyzer was used to measure the R values of the copolymer membranes over the frequency range of 100
Hz to 1 MHz. A four-probe conductivity cell was used to hold the membranes.
