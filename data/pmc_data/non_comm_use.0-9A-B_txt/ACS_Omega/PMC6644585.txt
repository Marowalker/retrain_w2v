The development of
fluorescent chemosensors for various analytes
has been actively pursued by chemists. Since their inception, these
efforts have led to many new sensors that have found wide applications
in the fields of chemistry, biology, environmental science, and physiology.
The search for fluorescent chemosensors was initiated by a few pioneering
groups in the late 1970s and 1980s and blossomed during the last two
decades to include more than hundreds of research groups around the
world. The targets for these sensors vary from metal ions, anions,
reactive oxygen/nitrogen species, biothiols, and toxic gases. Our
group has made contributions to this area in last 18 years. In this
perspective, we briefly introduce the history of chemosensors and
review studies that we have carried out.

1 Introduction
Fluorescent chemosensors
were defined at that early time as “compounds
incorporating a binding site, a fluorophore, and a mechanism for communication
between the two sites” (Figure 1).1 However, if the fluorescent
sensor participates in an irreversible chemical reaction with a specific
analyte, then it is generally called a fluorescent chemodosimeter.2 However, in the last couple of decades, the terms
fluorescent chemosensors and fluorescent chemodosimeters have been
used interchangeably and fluorescent probes are now more commonly
referred to by either name, especially when they are used in biological
applications. In this perspective, we use the term “fluorescent
chemosensors” to refer for these systems.

Series 538 “Fluorescent
Chemosensors for Ions and Molecular Recognition” edited
by Anthony W. Czarnik.

During the late 1970s and in 1980s, Sousa,3 Bousa-Laurent,4 de Silva,5 Tsien,6 Czarnik,7 and others carried out pioneering investigations
focusing
on the development of fluorescent chemosensors, in which crown and
azacrown ethers or other ligands were linked to fluorophores. These
chemosensors recognize metal ions in a selective manner through changes
taking place in fluorescence signals. In most cases, methylene bridges
were incorporated between the ligands and fluorophores and the fluorescence
was modulated by the presence or absence of photoinduced electron-transfer
(PET) quenching process involving lone-pair electrons on amine nitrogens
or ether oxygens. Typically, fluorescence emission is turned on upon
binding of the metal ion as a consequence of blocking PET, referred
to as chelation-enhanced fluorescence. As a result, in its early stages,
the development of chemosensors was benefited greatly by advances
made in host–guest, macrocyclic, and supramolecular chemistry.8

The scope of fluorescent chemosensors was
expanded in continuing
efforts by taking advantage of different or combinations of photophysical
mechanisms and new concepts, such as aggregation-induced emission
(AIE),9 two-photon excitation microscopy,10 and, more recently, high- and super-resolution
fluorescence microscopy.11 Probably, the
most dramatic advances in this area can be attributed to the development
of chemodosimeters that operate on the basis of analyte selective
chemical reactions. Even though fluorescent sensors of this type have
the clear disadvantage of irreversibility not shared by fluorescent
chemosensors based on host–guest chemistry, they often show
very high selectivities toward target analytes.12,13

In this perspective, we briefly introduce the history of chemosensors
and discuss the contributions to this topic we made during last 18
years. The perspective is organized by types of analytes, such as
metal ions, anions, reactive oxygen species (ROS), biothiols, and
gases. In addition, the concepts employed to design sensors based
on analyte-specific binding and reaction will be discussed. Finally,
the future directions of research in this area will be commented on
briefly.

2 Fluorescent Chemosensors for Various Analytes
2.1 Fluorescent Chemosensors for Metal Ions
Zn2+ is reported to be involved in various physiological
processes and diseases, such as ischemic stroke, epilepsy, and Alzheimer’s
disease. As a result, we have designed sensors for this metal ion
that contain various binding sites or ligands and various fluorophores.14,15 One example is the Zn2+ chemosensor based on the 7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole
derivative 1, bearing nitrogen binding sites. This substance
shows a selective enhancement (5.5-fold) of fluorescence intensity
at pH 7.2 upon the addition of Zn2+.16 In addition, a distinct colorimetric change from red to
yellow occurs upon Zn2+, which was attributed to the operation
of an internal charge-transfer (ICT) mechanism, as shown in Figure 2. Pancreatic islets,
which play an important role in insulin biosynthesis, contain relatively
high Zn2+ concentrations. As a result, the utility of the
new probe was demonstrated by its use to detect intrinsic Zn2+ ions present in pancreatic β-cells.

Figure 2 Stepwise binding mechanism
of 1 with Zn2+.

In another study, the naphthalimide derivative 2,
bearing a DPA group, in aqueous solution was reported to bind Zn2+ in both amide and imidic acid tautomeric forms. For example, 2 binds Cd2+ via an amide tautomeric form (Figure 3).17 The existence of the two different binding modes was supported
by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and IR data. Moreover, the addition
of Zn2+ induces a 22-fold fluorescent increase in the intensity
and a red shift (483 nm to 514 nm) of the emission band of 2. On the contrary, a hypsochromic shift (483–446 nm) takes
place upon the addition of Cd2+, which can be attributed
to binding via the amide tautomeric form. The respective dissociation
constants of 2 for Zn2+ and Cd2+ were calculated to be 5.7 and 48.5 nM. 2 displays green
emission in response to Zn2+ and blue emission for Cd2+ in live cells. As shown in Figure 4, intrinsic Zn2+ ions can be imaged
during the development of live zebrafish embryos using 2.

Figure 3 Proposed binding of 2 with metal ions via amide and
imidic acid tautomeric forms.

Figure 4 Images of zebrafish pretreated with 5 μM probe 2 for 1 h. (a) Images of 19 h-old, (b) 36 h-old, and (c) 48 h-old
zebrafish. (d) Image of 54 h-old zebrafish incubated with 2 for 1 h and (e) image of 54 h-old zebrafish after pretreatment with
TPEN (100 μM) for 1 h and subsequent treatment of washed zebrafish
with 2 for 1 h (ref (17)).

Near-infrared (NIR) probes for metal ions, which emit light
in
the range of 650–900 nm, have strong advantages, such as relatively
deep tissue penetration and minimal background interference and photodamage.18 As a result, we designed and prepared the cyanine
derivative 3, bearing a tris(2-pyridylmethyl)amine moiety,
as a Zn2+ selective NIR probe.19,20 This cyanine derivative contains a fully extended polymethine chain
that leads to an absorption maximum at 670 nm and an emission maximum
at 730 nm. Addition of Zn2+ induces significant hypsochromic
shifts in the absorption of 3 to 510 nm and in its emission
to 590 nm, which were attributed to the disruption of conjugation
by forming the less delocalized diamino-tetraene chromophore, as shown
in Figure 5. The dissociation
constant of 3 with Zn2+ was calculated to
be 1.2 nM. Cyanine derivative 3 can be utilized to image
Zn2+ released during apoptosis and endogenous Zn2+ in zebrafish, as shown in Figure 6. Especially interesting, a strong red emission was
observed in zebrafish neuromasts, in which expressed metallothioneins
play an important role in Zn2+ homeostasis.

of Zn2+.

Rhodamines are known to undergo
a distinct colorimetric change
from colorless to dark pink along with off–on fluorescent enhancement
when their spirolactone or spirolactam rings suffer cleavage.21 In the pioneering work in 1997, Czarnik showed
that a chemodosimeter based on rhodamine serves as a Cu2+ selective fluorescent and colorimetric chemosensor.22 In 2005, a reversible fluorescent chemosensor based on
rhodamine 4 bearing a polydiacetylene (PDA) ligand was
developed by our group.23 In the report
of this effort, the first X-ray crystal structure of a rhodamine lactam
derivative was reported, which clearly shows that the spirolactam
ring and xanthene core are oriented perpendicular to each other. As
shown in Figure 7,
Pb2+ binding to the DPA ligand as well as carbonyl oxygen
in 4 induces a ring-opening process, resulting in a large,
completely reversible fluorescent enhancement (100-fold) and a colorimetric
change.

Figure 7 Proposed binding mode of 4 with Pb2+ via
a spirolactam ring-opening process.

This concept was then applied to the design of Cu2+ and
Hg2+ selective reversible rhodamine-based chemosensors
that contain boronic acid binding sites.24 The design also combines the reaction-based chemodosimeter concept
to the rhodamine ring-opening process. Accordingly, the selenolactone
rhodamine derivative 5 was synthesized and explored as
a chemodosimeter for highly toxic mercury and methylmercury (Figure 8).25 At pH 7.4, seleno-rhodamine derivative 5 shows
a highly selective fluorescent enhancement and distinct color change
upon the addition of mercury species, caused by a deselenation reaction.
Fluorescent chemodosimeter 5 was also applied to image
Hg2+ and methylmercury in zebrafish as an animal model.
A strong red emission was observed in the fin, eggs, and gallbladder,
which was attributed to the presence of Hg2+ and methylmercury
at these locations.

Figure 8 Deselenation
reaction of 5 with Hg2+ and
CH3Hg+.

As shown in Figure 9, the rhodamine-alkyne derivative 6 selectively
reacts
with Au3+ over various metal ions at pH 7.4 to form an
oxazolecarbaldehyde product. This process induces a ring-opening reaction,
resulting in a 250-fold fluorescent enhancement and distinct color
change.26 The observed rate constant for
the process was calculated to be 4.5 (±0.20) × 10–4 s–1, and 6 has a Au3+ detection
limit of 320 nM. Also, the rhodamine-alkyne derivative 6 was used to image Au3+ in the live cells.

Figure 9 Proposed reaction of 6 with Au3+ to induce
spirolactam ring opening and the structure of 7.

The 1,8-naphthalimide-alkyene
derivative 7 was also
developed for use to selectively detect Au3+ in lipid droplets
in cells.27 When Au3+ is added,
a large hypsochromic shift (∼56 nm) takes place in the emission
spectrum of 7 along with a colorimetric change from yellow
to light pink. The detection limit was reported to be 8.44 μM.
An enhancement in the rate of reaction of 7 with Au3+ is promoted by surfactants and occurs in differentiated
adipocytes compared to that in HeLa cells. 1,8-Naphthalimide-alkyene
derivative 7 can be employed to image Au3+ in lipid droplets in cells.

2.2 Fluorescent
Chemosensors for Anions Using
Imidazoliums
Because imidazoliums act as [C–H]+-anion ionic hydrogen-bonding donors, they have been utilized
as anionic receptors and fluorescent chemosensors.28 The anthracene derivative 8, a sensor of this
type, was developed in our laboratory (Figure 10). In this sensor, two imidazolium groups
are linked to the 1,8 positions of the anthracene ring system.29 The fluorescence of chemosensor 8 in acetonitrile is efficiently and selectively quenched by H2PO4– and F–, which was attributed to the operation of a PET process. The 1,8-positions
of anthracene provide a preorganized binding site, and at the same
time, the anthracene ring acts as a fluorophore. The dimeric derivative 9 contains a more organized binding site for anions, and as
a result, it displays an enhanced selectivity for H2PO4– over F– as reflected
in an enhanced fluorescent quenching efficiency.30 Moreover, the water-soluble analogue 10, bearing
additional ammonium moieties, was used as GTP and ATP selective fluorescent
chemosensors at pH 7.4 in pure aqueous solution.31 A large fluorescent quenching effect was observed upon
the addition of GTP with an association constant of 8.7 × 104 M–1, and a moderate fluorescent enhancement
was observed upon the addition of ATP with a 1.5 × 104 M–1 association constant.

Figure 10 Structures of anthracene–imidazolium
derivatives 8–10.

Naphthoimidazoliums can serve dual functions as fluorophores
and
strong hydrogen-bonding donors. Moreover, electron-deficient aromatic
rings are used for anion−π interaction-driven recognition.
Our group and one directed by Kim reported that naphthoimidazolium
cage compounds bearing electron-rich alkylbenzene rings bind F– inside their cavities through an anion−π
interaction.32 As shown in Figure 11, F– is
encapsulated into the cavity of host 12, which was confirmed
by 1H NMR and 19F NMR. A ratiometric fluorescent
change of host 12 was observed to take place upon the
addition of F–. The 19F NMR spectrum
of the complex contains a quartet (J = 84 Hz) attributed
to coupling between F– and naphthoimidazolium C2–H. Also, a doublet (J = 84 Hz) is
seen in the 1H NMR spectrum of the complex. Finally, we
concluded that F– interacts with the naphthoimidazolium
moieties of host 11 outside of the cavity.

Figure 11 Different
binding modes of naphthoimidazolium-based cage compounds 11 and 12 with F–.

We observed that owing to the presence of the benzobisimidazolium
group, the rigid cyclic fluorescent chemosensor 13 displaying
an enhanced C–H hydrogen bonding with anions (Figure 12).33 In CH3CN and CH3CN-buffer (pH 7.4) (9:1, v/v), 13 undergoes a selective enhancement in its emission upon
the addition of HSO4–. On the contrary,
no significant change was observed following the addition of other
anions such as F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, H2PO4–, CH3CO2–, CN–, and NO3–. The
significant downfield shift of Ha from 7.56 to 8.10 ppm
in the 1H NMR spectrum promoted by the addition of HSO4– confirms the existence of C–H hydrogen-bonding
interactions with HSO4–. The effects
of charge, preorganization, and multiple C–H hydrogen bonding
are responsible for the selectivity of this rigid cyclic chemosensor.

Figure 12 Structure
of cyclic chemosensor 13.

It is quite challenging to design sensors that recognize
specific
nucleoside triphosphates in mixtures containing similar nucleoside
triphosphates, such as adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP), guanosine
5′-triphosphate (GTP), cytidine 5′-triphosphate (CTP),
uridine 5′-triphosphate (UTP), and TTP.34 In studies focusing on this issue, we observed that imidazolium
receptor 14, bearing two pyrene groups, displays a unique
selectivity for ATP over other nucleoside triphosphates.35 Fluorescent chemosensor 14 displays
strong excimer emission at 487 nm with relatively weak monomer emission
at 375 nm. The selectivity of 14 was proposed to be associated
with different binding modes of ATP compared to that of other nucleoside
triphosphates. As shown in Figure 13, adenine of ATP prefers to be bound between two pyrene
rings, whereas GTP, CTP, UTP, and TTP bases prefer to be located on
the outside of two pyrene rings as a consequence of greater H−π
interactions. Accordingly, a highly selective ratiometric change (I375/I487) occurs
in the emission spectrum of 14 upon the addition of ATP.
This fluorescent chemosensor was applied to image ATP in the live
cells.

2.3 Fluorescent
Chemosensors for Anions Using
Metal Ion Binding Sites or Metal-Displacement Approaches
Interactions with metal ions are effective in promoting strong binding
of anions in an aqueous solution. This is especially true for a fluorescent
chemosensor containing Zn2+, which we have actively investigated
for detecting phosphate species, such as pyrophosphate (PPi) and ATP.36 A Zn2+ complex of naphthaldimide
derivative 15, bearing two DPA ligands, was found to
selectively recognize PPi in 100% aqueous solution.37 An excimer emission at 490 nm was observed to arise upon
the addition of PPi to 15 at pH 7.4. As shown in Figure 14, as a result of
favorable interactions between two Zn2+ sites and phosphate
anions as well as π–π interaction, 2 + 2 type excimer
formation occurs between 15 in the presence of PPi.

Figure 14 2 + 2 Type excimer formation
of the Zn2+–15 complex with PPi.

A preorganized binding pocket
containing two Zn2+ sites
was created using fluorescein38 and acridine39 as fluorophores (Figure 15). The Zn complex with fluorescein derivative 16, bearing two DPA ligands, showed a moderate fluorescent
enhancement (∼150%) as well as color change to pink upon the
addition of PPi at pH 7.4.38 The association
constant of the formed complex was calculated to be 9.8 × 104 M–1. On the contrary, no significant change
was observed upon the addition of phosphate (Pi). Fluorescence of
the Zn complex of acridine–DPA derivative 17 is
quenched by PPi, and a moderate fluorescent enhancement is promoted
by Pi at pH 7.4 (Figure 15).39 The association constant for
PPi was calculated to be 4.85 × 107 M–1 and that of Pi was found to be 9.36 × 104 M–1. The presence of additional hydrogen-bonding interactions
between acridine nitrogen and OH of Pi was suggested to be responsible
for the moderate fluorescence enhancement.

Figure 15 Structures of the Zn
complexes 16 and 17.

In contrast, the Zn complex of perylene–DPA 18 shows large fluorescent enhancements upon the addition
of UTP and
UDP at pH 7.4. Other phosphate derivatives, such as ATP, GTP, CTP,
and TTP, and PPi and Pi do not induce any significant emission changes.40 As shown in Figure 16, the fluorescent chemosensor 18 binds to UTP or UDP via Zn interactions with the uridine base and
phosphate group. The chemosensor was applied to distinguish between
the activities of the two related enzymes, UDP–glucose pyrophosphorylase
and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase (β-1,4-GalT). A fluorescence
decrease was observed in the presence of UDP–glucose pyrophosphorylase
because UTP and glucose-phosphate are transformed to uridine 5′-diphosphate-glycoside
and PPi by this enzyme. On the other hand, a fluorescence enhancement
occurs in the presence of β-1,4-GalT.

Figure 16 Structure of perylene–Zn
complex 18 and its
proposed binding mode with UTP and UDP with two Zn sites.

Figure 17 Displacement mechanism of fluorescent chemosensor 19–Cu2+ with cyanide to revive the NIR emission.

Fluorescent chemosensors for cyanide
have been actively investigated
using various design strategies.41 The
fact that cyanide forms a very stable [Cu(CN)x]n− species with Cu2+ was utilized to design a Cu2+ displacement-based
NIR probe.42 Cyanine derivative 19 shows NIR emission at 748 nm (Figure 17). When Cu2+ is added to a solution
of 19 at pH 7.4, almost complete quenching of the fluorescence
of 19 occurs in association with a red shift of its absorption
maximum from 718 to 743 nm. Addition of cyanide anion revives the
emission at 748 nm, which is attributed to the formation of [Cu(CN)x]n− species. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is known to produce toxic
HCN, which is related to the pathogenesis of CF lung disease. To explore
this issue, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled PA14 strain
was incubated with the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (Figure 18). Chemosensor 19 was successfully employed to image HCN produced in the
nematode by PA14. When the β-lactam antibiotic, ceftazidime,
is then preadministered to the PA14 treated nematode, the green emission
from GFP and NIR fluorescence of 19 was significantly
reduced.

Figure 18 Fluorescence images of C. elegans, infected by P. aeruginosa and treated
with the antibiotic ceftazidime. The nematodes were fed with GFP-labeled P. aerugionosa (PA14) for 2 d followed by incubation
with ceftazidime (200 μg/mL) for 2 h. The scale bars represent
20 μm (Reprinted from ref (42)).

2.4 ROS and Nitrogen Species
ROS and
reactive nitrogen species (RNS) play key roles in physiological processes
and various diseases, such as neurodegenerative disorders, cancer,
and so forth. Fluorescent chemosensors for ROS and RNS have been designed
based on specific reactions they promote.43 Hypochlorous acid (HOCl) is a class of ROS, which is produced from
hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and Cl– by myeloperoxidase (MPO).44 HOCl is generated
in the phagocytic cells as a defense system to kill pathogens. On
the other hand, excess HOCl can cause chronic inflammatory, cardiovascular
and kidney diseases.45

Among the
various ROS such as H2O2, NO•, •OH, ROO•, ONOO–, 1O2, HOCl, and •O2–, HOCl at pH 5.5 can be selectively detected by
using fluorescent enhancements of the thiolactone and selenolactone
rhodamine derivatives 20 and 21.46 As shown in Figure 19, HOCl promoted ring-opening caused by sulfur
oxidation is the reason for the large fluorescent enhancement (∼20-fold)
of 20. The HOCl detection limits of 20 and 21 were reported to be 0.4 and 0.6 μM, respectively.
Fluorescent chemosensor 20 was successfully applied to
image microbiocidal HOCl produced in the mucosal epithelia of fruit
fly upon bacterial infection. It is also known that the enzyme, NADPH
oxidase 2 (NOX2), plays a key role in the production of HOCl by neutrophils.47 Upon bacterial infection, endogenous HOCl, generated
in bone marrow-derived neutrophils (BMDNs) extracted from WT mice
(NOX2+/+) or NOX2-deficient mice (NOX2–/–), can be clearly detected by using 20.48 Strong emission of 20 was observed in BMDNs
extracted from WT mice (NOX2+/+), whereas no significant
fluorescence is seen in the case of NOX2-deficient mice (NOX2–/–).

Figure 19 Structures of HOCl selective fluorescent probes 20–21 and the ring-opening reaction of 20 with HOCl via sulfur
oxidation.

Oxidative cleavage of
C–B bonds, especially in the borono-Dakin
oxidation of arylboronic acids and their esters, has been widely utilized
for the design of fluorescent chemosensors for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).49 Our previous
thiolactone strategy was utilized in conjunction with borono-Dakin
oxidation of arylboronic ester, to design the so-called “dual-lock”
system in 22, which serves as a selective fluorescent
chemosensor for HOCl (Figure 20).5022 contains an
arylboronic ester and a thiolactone group. As shown in Figure 20, H2O2, ONOO–, and HOCl convert the arylboronic ester
in nonfluorescent 22 to a phenol (22-I),
which is still nonfluorescent. On the other hand, only HOCl oxidizes
the thiolactone to form the fluorescein derivative 22-II, resulting in strong green emission (∼120-fold enhancement)
due to the occurrence of a ring-opening process. 22 operates
in the relatively large pH window of 5.5 to 9.3, which means it can
be used to image HOCl in the rather acidic lysosome environment. 22 was also used to detect bacteria-induced HOCl production
in the mucosal epithelia of fruit fly.

Figure 20 Borono-Dakin oxidation
of 22 with OCl–, H2O2, and ONOO– and selective
oxidation of thiolactone moiety with HOCl to induce strong green fluorescence.

Imidazoline-2-thione moiety was
also utilized as a reactive center
in the HOCl selective fluorescent chemosensor. For example, substances
containing this group, such as 23 and 24, are converted to imidazolium products, which are fluorescent (Figure 21).51 Upon the addition of HOCl to a solution of 23, a new peak at 378 nm appears in the absorption spectrum with the
decrease of the peak at 420 nm. Twelvefold fluorescent enhancement
at 505 nm was also observed upon the addition of HOCl to 23. The imidazoline-2-thione containing sensor 24 displays
changes in its absorption and fluorescence spectra that are similar
to those of 23. 22 was applied to detect
endogenous HOCl produced in RAW 264.7 macrophages, which are activated
by lipopolysaccharides (LPS) (Figure 22). A strong green emission in the live cells and tissues
was observed by using two-photon microscopy (TPM). Pretreatment with
the known MPO inhibitors, 4-aminobenzoicacid hydrazide (ABAH) and
flufenamic acid, causes a dramatic fluorescence quenching effect.
Furthermore, RAW 264.7 macrophages in a cocultured system can be distinguished
from HeLa cells by green emission of 23 resulting from
the production of HOCl.

form fluorescent imidazolium
product 26.

Imidazoline-2-thione derivative, bearing triphenylphosphine
as
a mitochondria directing group, was employed to detect HOCl in mitochondria.
Imidazoline-2-thione derivative 25 can also be utilized
to image HOCl in live cells and tissues using the TPM technique (Figure 21).52 Pearson’s colocalization coefficient of this substance
using Mito Tracker Red as a reference was found to be 0.83.

The pyrene containing N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) borane
complex 27 was developed in our laboratory as the first
sensor of
HOCl (Figure 23).53 We proposed that NHC borane reacts selectively
with HOCl over other ROS via an electrophilic type oxidation pathway,
which stands in contrast with nucleophilic oxidations of arylboronic
acids or esters promoted by ROS. As shown in Figure 23, NHC borane 27 displays an
aggregated excimer emission and undergoes oxidative cleavage of the
B–C bond to afford an imidazolium product, which shows a strong
monomeric emission. Accordingly, ratiometric changes in the green
(477 nm) and blue (374 nm) channels were observed. TPM was utilized
along with 27 to carry out ratiometric detection of endogenous
HOCl in live cells and tissues.

with HOCl. Excimer formation of 27 and preferred monomer
formation of imidazolium product after the reaction with HOCl.

The naphthalimide derivative 28, containing boronate
and morpholine groups, was designated by us to be a fluorescent chemosensor
for H2O2.54 As shown
in Figure 24, the p-dihydroxyborylbenzyloxycarbonyl group in 28 acts as a selective site for reaction with H2O2 at pH 7.4. Fluorescence emission at 528 nm is selectively promoted
by reaction of 28 with H2O2 over
various ROS and RNS. Because 28 contains a morpholine
group, which is known to target lysosomes, it can be employed to detect
endogenous H2O2 in the lysosome of the RAW 264.7
cells.

Figure 24 H2O2 selective fluorescent chemosensor 28 and its reaction with H2O2 to form
fluorescent product 28-I.

The ROS ONOO– also plays important roles
in signal
transduction, even though ONOO– shows antibacterial
activity through its ability to damage DNA and proteins owing to its
high oxidizing and nitrating capacities.55 The coumarin–hemicyanine derivative 29 showed
ratiometric changes in its emission along with distinct colorimetric
changes when it is in the presence of peroxynitrite (ONOO–).56 Upon the addition of ONOO– to 29, ratiometric fluorescent changes (F515nm/F635nm) were clearly
observed. As shown in Figure 25, 1,3,3-trimethyloxindole and Coum-CHO are produced by the
reaction of this sensor with ONOO–, which is responsible
for the increase of green emission and decrease of red emission. Coumarin–hemicyanine
derivative 29 can be used to image the production of
ONOO– in RAW 264.7 cells, which are treated with
LPS and IFN-g and stimulated by PMA. Pretreatment of the RAW 264.7
cells with aminoguanidine, a NO synthase inhibitor, or 2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-1-piperidinyloxy
(TEMPO), a superoxide scavenger, causes no significant change in fluorescence
emission upon the addition of 29 (Figure 26).

change.

nm with an excitation wavelength at 559 nm, images (c,g,k,o) represent
DIC channels (differential interference contrast), and images (d,h,I,p)
represent merged images of red and green channels (Reprinted from

More recently, a N-dearylation reaction promoted
by ONOO– was utilized as the basis for our design
of the two-photon ONOO– probe 30.57 In PBS buffer, chemosensor 30 shows
selective fluorescent
enhancement (14-fold) at 501 nm upon the addition of ONOO–. The emission of the naphthalene fluorophore in 30 is
quenched by electron transfer from the electron-rich aniline group.
Reaction of 30 with ONOO– generates 30-I that has enhanced fluorescence emission and two-photon
absorption properties (Figure 27). The detection limit of 30 for ONOO– was calculated to be 35 nM. Chemosensor 30 was applied to image endogenous ONOO– in RAW 264.7
cells and to detect endogenous ONOO– in rat hippocampal
tissues. It is worth mentioning that 30 has excellent
two-photon properties associated with a high two-photon cross-sectional
value (δ ≈ 100 GM) and a deep light penetration depth
of 120 μm.

a fluorescent product 30-I.

Rhodamine derivative 31, bearing a hydrazide
group,
was explored as an ONOO– selective fluorescent chemosensor
(Figure 28).58 Addition of ONOO– to a solution
of 31 induces a strong far-red emission at 638 nm. The
detection limit of 1 for ONOO– was
calculated to be 45 nM. Both exogenous and endogenous ONOO– in RAW 264.7 and HeLa cells can be detected using 31. 31 was further applied to detect endogenous ONOO– in mouse BMDNs, which are infected by using GFP-tagged P. aeruginosa (PAO1). As shown in Figure 28, different fluorescence emissions
were observed in BMDNs extracted from wild-type (Nox2+/+) and Nox2-deficient (Nox2–/–) mice, which
can be attributed to the presence of different ONOO– concentrations.

of
GFP-tagged PAO1 and 31 in BMDNs. Images of neutrophils
derived from Nox2+/+ (top) or Nox2–/– (bottom) mice treated with GFP-tagged PAO1 and 31 for
1 h. Images of GFP-tagged PAO1 (green) were obtained at 488 nm using
500–550 nm excitation. Images of 31 (red) were
obtained at 561 nm using 630–660 nm excitation. The scale bars
are 20 μm.

The fluorescent chemosensor 32 was found by us to
be an excited-state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT) fluorophore
that responds to NO (Figure 29).59 At pH = 7.4, 32 displays blue emission at 470 nm which is attributed to the operation
of an ESIPT mechanism. Upon the addition of NO, the intensity of the
emission band at 560 nm increases with a decrease of the original
emission band at 470 nm. In addition, the emission color clearly changes
from blue to yellow, which can be detected by using the naked eyes.
A linear relationship was observed between the emission intensity
at 560 nm and the concentration of NO in the range of 0–10
μM with a detection limit of 17 nM. This chemosensor was also
applied to image NO in living cells.

chemosensor 32 with NO.

2.5 Fluorescent Chemosensors for Biothiols and
H2S
Cysteine (Cys), homocysteine (Hcy), and glutathione
(GSH) are the three main biothiols involved in human physiology. Abnormal
levels of Cys, a precursor of GSH, are related to various human diseases,
such as liver damage, edema, and loss of muscle and fat.60 The total Hcy level in plasma is related to
cognitive impairment in the elderly and birth defects.61 On the other hand, the most abundant nonprotein
thiol, GSH, plays various important roles, such as intracellular signal
transduction and intracellular redox control agent, and it is related
to critical diseases including Alzheimer’s disease and cancer.62 In mammalian cells, the concentrations of these
biothiols are in the range of 1–10 mM for GSH, 30–200
μM for Cys, and 5–15 μM for Hcy. In last two decades,
fluorescent chemosensors for these biothiols have been actively investigated
by various groups worldwide.63,64

Our first contribution
to this area was reported in 2010.65 The
fluorescein derivative 33 is reported to undergo Michael
addition reactions with GSH, Cys, and Hcy followed by spirocyclic
lactone ring opening, as shown in Figure 30. This induces an “off–on”
fluorescent enhancement at 520 nm at pH 7.4. This probe can be used
to image GSH selectively in live cells and organisms owing to the
much higher cellular concentrations of GSH compared to those of Cys
and Hcy. The fluorescein derivative 33 can also be utilized
to image biothiols in murine P19 embryonic carcinoma cells and zebrafish.
When the cells are pretreated with N-methylmaleimide,
a Michael acceptor of thiols, almost no fluorescence is observed.

Figure 30 Proposed
reaction of chemosensor 33 with biothiols
to form fluorescent spiroring-opened product.

Strongin’s group described 34, the first
example
of a Cys selective fluorescent chemosensor that relies on a kinetically
favored seven-membered ring formation promoted by Cys.66Figure 31 shows the unique modulation of polymethine π-electron
cyanine system in probe 34 caused by reaction with Cys.
This process induces large shifts in the absorption and emission spectra
of 34. Hydroxy cyanine 34 displays maximum
absorption at 710 nm and emission at 730 nm. On the other hand, its
keto form 34-I has a dramatic hypsochromic shift to 535
nm in its absorption and 625 nm for its emission maxima. The related
cyanine derivative 35, bearing an acrylate moiety, was
reported to be a Cys selective NIR chemosensor.67 As shown in Figure 31, Cys undergoes an addition reaction with 35 followed by kinetically favored seven-membered ring formation to
form 34-I. As a result, similar distinct changes occur
in the absorption (from 770 to 515 nm) and emission (from 780 to 570
nm) spectra. It is known that the intracellular Cys level is significantly
increased during glucose deprivation. Cyanine derivative 35 can be employed to selectively detect this increase in Cys level
in MCF-7 cells by a distinct emission enhancement at 590 nm and a
decrease in the NIR emission.

Figure 31 Structures of 34 and 34-I and reaction
of 35 with Cys via Michael-type addition followed by
intramolecular rearrangement.

The salicyladazine derivative 36, bearing an
acrylate
moiety, serves as a Cys chemosensor that operates in a kinetically
selective manner.68 When 36 is treated with Cys for 15 min, a selective fluorescent enhancement
(∼10-fold) at 505 nm occurs. On the other hand, both Cys and
GSH induce a fluorescence increase of 36 after 40 min.
Similar results were obtained in studies of cell imaging. As shown
in Figure 32, the
reaction responsible for these changes involves Michael-type addition
followed by cyclization to afford the salicylaldazine dye. The hydroxyl
group in the salicylaldazine dye forms an intermolecular hydrogen
bond, which was attributed to the emission at 505 nm.

Figure 32 Proposed reaction mechanism
of 36 with Cys via Michael-type
addition followed by intramolecular rearrangement to form AIE and
ESIPT active products.

The pyrene derivatives, 37 and 38, display
selective fluorescence enhancements at 450 nm in the presence of Hcy
at pH 7.4 (Figure 33).69 The formation of thiazinane heterocyclic
rings from the reaction of Hcy with the aldehyde groups in these substances
was attributed to the selectivity toward Hcy. The detection limits
of 37 and 38 were reported to be 1.94 and
0.14 μM, respectively. Pyrene derivatives, 37 and 38, can be employed to image Hcy in mammalian cells.

Figure 33 Structures
of pyrene derivatives 37 and 38.

The aryl-thioether-substituted nitrobenzothiadiazole
derivative, 38, was investigated as a Cys and Hcy selective
fluorescent
chemosensor that acts via an aryl substitution reaction by the thiol
moieties in these analytes followed by intramolecular rearrangement,
as shown in Figure 34.70 Treatment of 38 with
Cys and Hcy at pH 7.4 induces a 20-fold fluorescent enhancement at
535 nm. More importantly, at acidic pH such as 6.0, only Cys induces
this fluorescence enhancement, the selectivity being a consequence
of the higher acidity of the thiol in Cys (pKa 8.53) compared to that of Hcy (pKa 10.00). Strong green emission was also used for detection by 38 of Cys and Hcy in the live HeLa cells.

Figure 34 Proposed reactions of 38 with Cys and Hcy to form
fluorescent amino products via an aryl substitution reaction followed
by intramolecular rearrangement.

Two cyanine derivatives, 39 bearing a 2,4-dinitrobenzene
sulfonamide group and 40 containing a 5-dimethylaminonaphthyl
sulfonamide group, were investigated in our laboratory as NIR fluorescent
chemosensors for biothiols at pH 7.4 (Figure 35).71 Addition
of GSH, Cys and Hcy to 39 generates the fluorescent product 41, whereas cyanine derivative 40 reacts selectively
with GSH to cause this fluorescent enhancement. It is known that overdose
of the painkiller acetaminophen can damage the liver and kidney cells
and lower GSH levels. We confirmed these phenomena using a mouse model
and the GSH fluorescent chemosensor 40. More recently,
in collaboration with Yin and Tan, it is reported that 42 serves as a dual-channel fluorescent chemosensor for GSH (Figure 35).72 Probe 42 is composed of cyanine IR-780 and
1,8-naphthalimide, which are linked by a thiol-reactive sulfonamide
group. Reaction with GSH promotes large synchronous enhancements of
the visible emission (495 nm) and NIR emission (795 nm) bands. In
addition, 42 shows an excellent targeting ability for
mitochondria.

Figure 35 Reactions of 39, 40, and 42 with biothiols to form fluorescent product 41.

The two GSH NIR fluorescent chemosensors, 43 and 44, were also developed by us (Figure 36).73 Addition
of GSH to both of these nonfluorescent compounds induces dramatic
enhancements (∼50-fold for 43 and ∼100-fold
for 44) in their emission, whereas only a relatively
small enhancement occurs upon the addition of Hcy. The detection limits
of 43 and 44 for GSH were reported to be
6.3 and 3.3 μM, respectively. At pH 7.4, chemosensor 43, which has an absorption maximum at 660 nm, is not fluorescent.
Upon the addition of GSH, strong fluorescence emission at 805 nm arises
corresponding to an absorption maximum at 780 nm. The detailed mechanisms
for reactions of 43 and 44 with biothiols
are given in Figure 36. Both 43 and 44 can be utilized to image
GSH in the live cells with strong fluorescence being observed in the
tumors in tumor-bearing mice in which GSH is overexpressed.

Figure 36 Replacement
reactions of 43 and 44 with
GSH and subsequent rearrangement reactions with Cys and Hcy.

A displacement approach was recently
reported to create the GSH
sensor, bis-pyrene-Cu2+45 (Figure 37).74 This derivative displays excimer emission at 450 nm and relatively
weak monomer emission at 400 nm at pH 7.4. Addition of Cu2+ induces selective and efficient fluorescence quenching. The addition
of biothiols to the Cu2+–45 ensemble
revives the emission. The biothiol detection limit was calculated
to be 1.7 μM. Endogenous GSH in cells and in tissues was successfully
imaged by using 45 and TPM.

Figure 37 Structure of bis-pyrene
derivative 45.

The naphthalene dialdehyde derivatives, 46–48, were reported to be GSH selective fluorescent chemosensors (Figure 38).75 Addition of GSH to these substances causes a fluorescence
enhancements (100-fold for 46, 80-fold for 47, and 36-fold for 48) at ∼531 nm upon excitation
at 450 nm. All three derivatives can be used to image intracellular
GSH in HeLa cells. The detection limits of 46, 47, and 48 were calculated to be 64 nM, 68 nM,
and 1.3 μM, respectively. The proposed mechanism for the reaction
of these sensors with GSH is shown in Figure 38. Importantly, 47, (MNDA) bearing
an electron-donating group, can be used to image GSH in live cells
by using TPM with excitation at 900 nm. Importantly, 46 and 48 were applied to predict the mortality of patients
with sepsis (Figure 39), which means that these chemosensors can be used for medical diagnosis.

Figure 38 Simultaneous
sensing of biothiols based on reactions with dialdehyde 46–48.

the mortality of patients with sepsis (Copyright from ref (75)).

Because the intracellular GSH concentration in cells is in
the
range of 1–10 mM, the development of reversible GSH chemosensor
with desirable dissociation constants is important. The fluorescent
chemosensor 49 is reported to display ratiometric changes
in its absorption upon the addition of GSH (Figure 40).76 For example,
GSH causes the formation of a new absorption peak at 409 nm and a
decrease in the peak at 474 nm. Similar ratiometric changes were also
observed in the fluorescence spectrum, which displays an increase
at 488 nm and decrease at 560 nm upon the addition of GSH. Dilution
and addition of NEM or H2O2 induce the reverse
reaction and associated photophysical changes. The dissociation constant
of 49 with GSH of 2.59 mM and a fast response time (t1/2 = 5.82 s) are close to ideal. The GSH concentration
in live HeLa cells was calculated to be 5.40 ± 0.87 mM based
on the calibration curve obtained from ratiometric cell imaging data
using 49, which is very close to the reported value.

Figure 40 Reversible
reaction of 49 with GSH to show a ratiometric
fluorescent change.

The concentration of
H2S in the central nervous system
is reported to be between 50 and 160 μM 45, and
the sulfide level in blood plasma is between 10 and 100 μM.77 In studies designed to develop sensors that
detect H2S at these levels, we found that the naphthalimide
derivative 50 serves as a H2S selective fluorescent
chemosensor (Figure 41).78 A 68-fold fluorescence enhancement
was observed to occur at 532 nm upon the addition of H2S to a solution of 50 as a consequence of a reaction
(Figure 41) that produces
the piperazine–naphthalimide product 50-I. Because
it contains a triphenylphosphonium group, 50 locates
mainly in mitochondria. The H2S detection limit of 50 was reported to be 2.46 μM.

Figure 41 Reaction of 50 with H2S to form quencher-free
product 50-I.

The 2-(2’-hydroxyphenyl)benzothiazole derivative, 51, was designed as a H2S selective chemosensor,79 operating by the reaction shown in Figure 42. ESIPT emission
at 480 nm takes place upon the addition of H2S to 51. On the other hand, AIE at 540 nm was observed in higher
vol % fractions of PBS. Probe 51 can be used to image
H2S in live cells using one-photon and TPM.

Figure 42 Reaction
of 51 with H2S to form ESIPT activated
product 51-I.

The phenolphthalein derivative 52 was developed
as
a thiophenol (PhSH)-selective chemosensor (Figure 43).80 Thiophenol
reacts with 52 to form phenolphthalein quantitatively,
which turns pink (547 nm) when the pH is increased. Probe 52 was also applied to a filter paper, which undergoes a distinct color
change to pink upon the addition of thiophenol at pH 10.5. The detection
limit of 52 for thiophenol was found to be 6.15 μM.
An AND logic gate was constructed using PhSH and base as inputs and
color change of 52 viewed by the naked eye as an output.

2.6 Gas Selective Fluorescent
Chemosensors
Our group reported several examples of fluorescent
chemosensors for
CO2 and toxic gases, such as phosgene and nerve gas mimics.81,82 In 2002, in collaboration with Sessler, Lee, and Bielawski, we designed
an “anion-activated CO2 recognition” strategy
using benzobisimidazolium salts 53 (Figure 44).83 Addition of F– induces efficient fluorescent quenching
of 53 and the appearance in its absorption spectrum of
an ICT band centered at 344 nm as a result of initial formation of
(C–H)+···F– ionic
H-bonding and eventually NHCs. Addition of CO2 to F– treated 53 revived the original absorption
at 290 nm and fluorescence emission. The CO2 detection
limit of this system was reported to be 30 ppm. The formation of the
NHC carbene in this process was confirmed by isolation of the product
formed using CS2 instead of CO2.

Figure 44 Proposed
reaction of 53 with F– followed
by the addition of CO2 or CS2.

The anion-activated strategy to sense CO2 was utilized
by us to develop a sol–gel-based system.84 Naphthalimide derivative 54, utilized in this
system, contains a cholesterol and carbamate ester moiety (Figure 45) and undergoes
optimal gelation in DMSO among other solvents. The critical gelation
concentration was found to be 0.18 wt %. In the sol or gel state, 54 has a green color and blue emission. A distinct color change
to orange as well as an emission color change to orange occurs upon
the addition of F–. The green color and blue emission
are revived when CO2 gas is introduced. When this system
is heated to 80 °C under N2, CO2 is released
and the orange color and orange emission were regenerated. As shown
in Figure 45, F– induces deprotonation of the amide NH moiety in 54, which results in the distinct color and emission change
owing to ICT.

Figure 45 Reaction of 54 with F– followed
by the addition of CO2.

PDAs were utilized as colorimetric and fluorescent chemosensors
for CO2. PDAs are unique conjugated polymers, which have
blue color, and undergo a distinct colorimetric change to red and
a fluorescence enhancement upon exposure to various stimuli.85,86 A PDA, derived from diacteylene monomer containing a imidazolium
head group and the other primary amine, was constructed for the detection
of CO2.87 As shown in Figure 46, CO2 reacts with primary amine moiety in the PDA to form a carbamate,
which then interacts with imidazolium moiety resulting in the creation
of stress in the conjugated backbone and a consequent color transition
from blue (623 nm) to red (540 nm). A fluorescent enhancement also
accompanies addition of CO2. We used this system to create
PDA nanofibers, which can be used to detect CO2 gas in
the presence of triethylamine vapor.

Figure 46 Reaction of PDA-based chemosensor with
CO2 to form carbamate
moiety.

Several chemosensors were recently
reported for sensing the toxic
gas, phosgene. The first is the fluorescent and colorimetric chemosensor 55, which is based on cyclization reaction of a o-phenylenediamine moiety.88 Fluorescent
chemosensor 55 undergoes a selective colorimetric change
from light yellow to dark pink along with the development of a strong
red emission upon the addition of phosgene (Figure 47). On the other hand, the nerve gas mimic,
diethyl chlorophosphate (DCP), induces formation of green fluorescence.
Phosgene reacts with 55 to form a benzimidazolone-containing
product, whose ICT character is dramatically altered because the electron-donating
amine groups are converted to an electron-withdrawing urea group. 55 was applied to a polyethylene oxide membrane, which can
be employed to detect phosgene and DCP vapor by induction of different
color and fluorescent changes.

Figure 47 Proposed reaction of 55 with
phosgene to form benzimidazolone-containing
product, which can block PET process with a huge alteration of ICT
property.

Same strategy was also applied
to the design of 4-chloro-7-nitrobenzo[c]-[1,2,5]oxadiazole 56-, rhodamine 57-, and naphthalimide 58-based chemosensors (Figure 48).89 The structures of these chemosensors
and their products
of reactions with phosgene are shown in Figure 48. A distinct color change from dark orange
to pale yellow occurs when 56 is subjected phosgene.
On the other hand, rhodamine derivative 57 shows a large
fluorescent enhancement (∼60-fold) at 575 nm with a color change
from colorless to pink when exposed to this nerve agent. The detection
limit of 58 for phosgene was found to be 2.8 ppb. Nanofibers
containing 56 and 57 display clear color
and fluorescent changes when exposed to phosgene.

Figure 48 Proposed reactions of 56–58 with phosgene to
form benzimidazolone-containing products.

A so-called “second-generation sensor” for
phosgene
was developed in our laboratory. The new rhodamine derivative 59 shows a distinct color change to dark pink and a 3.7-fold
fluorescence enhancement at 578 nm when treated with phosgene.90 The detection limit was calculated to be 3.2
ppb. Most importantly, unlike previously developed chemosensors, 55–58, 59 reaction with phosgene does
not produce HCl as a byproduct. The mechanism of this process, shown
in Figure 49, was
confirmed by using 1H and 13C NMR as well as
mass spectroscopy. As shown in Figure 50, chemosensor 59 embedded in
nanofibers displays distinct colorimetric and fluorescent changes
in response to phosgene gas.

Figure 49 Reaction of rhodamine derivative 59 with triphosgene
to induce spriolactam ring-opening process.

Figure 50 Colorimetric and fluorescent changes of chemosensor 59 in a poly(ethylene oxide) nanofiber upon exposure to phosgene (0.8
mg/L phosgene gas).

2-(2-Aminophenyl)benzothiazole 60 was also synthesized,
which serves as an ESIPT-based fluorescent chemosensor. This substance
reacts with phosgene in the presence of triethylamine to produce color
and fluorescence changes (Figure 51).91 Chemosensor 60 displays blue emission at 445 nm, which upon exposure to phosgene
changes to an emission at 495 nm in conjunction with a decrease in
original blue emission. In addition, a color change from colorless
to yellow occurs upon exposure to phosgene. The detection limit of 60 for phosgene was found to be 0.14 ppm with a linear range
from 0–3.0 μM.

Figure 51 Reaction mechanism of 60 with
phosgene to form tetracyclic
product 60-I bearing strong electron-withdrawing group.

Another ESIPT-based chemosensor, 61, shows selective
fluorescence and colorimetric changes in response to the nerve gas
mimic, diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP), both in solution and the gas
phase.92 As shown in Figure 52, the salicylaldehyde oxime
moiety in 61 is converted to a nitrile in association
with a large fluorescent enhancement (∼60-fold) at 480 nm.
The detection limit was calculated to be 1.3 nM. Probe 61 (0.45 w/w %) was incorporated in electrospunfibers, using polyvinylpyrrolidone
as the matrix, which display clear colorimetric and fluorescent changes
upon exposure to DECP vapor.

to form fluorescent
nitrile derivative 61-III.

3 Future Outlook
Since the pioneering
work in the late 1970s and 1980s, fluorescent
chemosensors have been the subject of intense studies. Advances made
in molecular recognition and supramolecular chemistry greatly influenced
the early development of these chemosensors. After the initial phase
of studies in this area, the recognition of saccharides by boronic
acid groups was utilized by the James group.93 Also, Lippard groups reported the development of Zn2+ selective fluorescent chemosensors that have biological applications.14 The Nagano group also reported sensors for enzymes94 and BODIPY-based fluorescent chemosensors, and
their applications to molecular logic gates were developed by Akkaya.95

A key contribution was made in 1997 by
Czarnik’s group,
which developed a rhodamine derivative bearing hydrazine moiety that
binds to Cu2+. These workers found that hydrolysis of the
Cu2+complex induces ring-opening, resulting in a large
fluorescence enhancement.22 This can be
considered as the starting point from which organic chemists began
the study of chemodosimeters, in which various organic reactions promote
fluorescence changes. For example, Koide reported several examples
of reaction-based chemosensors for Hg2+ and Pd2+.13 In addition, Chang reported pioneering
work on the development of H2O2 selective chemosensors
based on boronic acid/ester oxidation process.12 Since that time, a variety of signaling units and the new
mechanism of AIE were actively studied by Tang.9 TPM has become a powerful tool especially for tissue imaging
because of its advantage of deep penetration.96

We believe the previous and current advances made in developing
fluorescent chemosensors will stimulate further activity aimed at
devising approaches to new target analytes or for disease diagnosis.97 Even though designing new chemosensors is a
challenging process, we believe that interdisciplinary collaborations
between chemists and biologists will facilitate the progress in this
area. New fluorophores need to be synthesized by organic chemists
and material chemists, which can show superior photophysical properties,
such as excellent quantum yield, high photostability, desirable solubility
in aqueous solution, NIR emission for deep penetration, and so forth.
A new binding site as well as a new reaction site for specific analyte
will be an important aspect for the development of new fluorescent
chemosensors. In addition, fluorescent chemosensors for biological
species can be combined with research on drug delivery98,99 and photodynamic therapy.100 Trigger
groups previously utilized for fluorescent chemosensors are currently
utilized for activatable drug delivery and activatable photosensitizers.
Recently, “one for all” concept was reported for the
phthalocyanine-based activatable photosensitizers, in which fluorescence
and singlet oxygen generation can be controlled.101 Moreover, fluorescent chemosensors can be applied to solve
environmental problems.

Consequently, we feel that fluorescent
chemosensors will play key
roles in future studies in the areas of chemistry, biology, chemical
biology, and medical and materials sciences.
