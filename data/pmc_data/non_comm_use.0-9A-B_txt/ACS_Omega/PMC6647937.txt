The
carbonate solution-dissolved rare earth showed some metastable
chemical characteristics. In this paper, the systematic investigation
of metastable dissolution regularity of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was carried out. The results showed
that Nd3+ has an instantaneous saturated solubility in
Na2CO3 solution. When the amount of the dissolution
Nd3+ did not reach the instantaneous saturated solubility,
the solution was in a stable-state period. Once the concentration
of Nd3+ exceeded the instantaneous saturated solubility,
the solution was no longer in the metastable state and generated the
neodymium double salt of carbonate precipitates rapidly. The molecular
dynamics simulation of the solution in the metastable state was carried
out. In high concentration Na2CO3 solution,
dissolved Nd3+ had a coordination reaction with the CO32–. Also, there was a stronger interaction
between Na+ and CO32–, which
caused the effective concentration of free CO32– which could react with Nd3+ to become lower. Thus, these
reasons make the solution exhibit a metastable state. In that metastable
period, the dissolved Nd3+ becomes steady and hard to generate
the neodymium double salt of carbonate precipitates.

1 Introduction
A large amount of ammonia-nitrogen or high salinity wastewater
is generated by using the traditional rare-earth separation methods,
such as solvent extraction and ion exchange,1,2 which
has been causing trouble to the healthy development of the rare-earth
industry. Some new rare-earth separation methods, such as the nonsaponification,
saponified, coordination extraction, and ionic liquid extraction,3−6 have some effects, but they are costly and difficult to resolve
wastewater problems. Hence, it is necessary to develop a new, green,
higher efficiency, and low-cost separation method for rare earth.

Rare-earth carbonate, the solubility of which is lower than 10–5 to 10–7 mol·L–1 in water, is a substance difficult to dissolve.7,8 However,
when the rare-earth salt solution was added at the high concentrated
carbonate solution, the rare earth could be dissolved in the carbonate
solution. The solubility of the rare earth did not decrease with the
increase of the concentration of carbonate but increased. During the
precipitation process of rare-earth carbonate in industry, the dissolution
of rare earth caused the higher rare-earth residual concentration
and brought about the unnecessary waste of rare-earth resource. However,
on the other hand, the concentration of rare earth in carbonate solution
increased regularly with the increase of the rare-earth atomic number.
This may provide an idea for a new rare-earth separation method.

Since 1963, the ability of rare earth to dissolve into potassium
carbonate solution was noted and investigated first by Taketatsu.9,10 The rare-earth cations reacted with carbonate anions and generated
rare-earth carbonate precipitates at first, but as the vibration and
reaction time prolonged, it was dissolved again. In addition, the
dissolution concentration of rare earth increased with the increase
of potassium carbonate concentration and atomic number of the rare
earth. Afterward, a series of studies confirmed the dissolution of
rare earth obtained by Taketatsu, not only in potassium carbonate
solution. For instance, De Vasconcellos et al.11 chose ammonium carbonate solution to dissolve rare earth
and obtained the same fruitage with Taketatsu. The dissolution amount
of rare earth also increased with the increase of the concentration
of ammonium carbonate and rare-earth atomic number. Nevertheless,
from the viewpoint of the precipitation yield of rare earth, it could
be clearly known that the yield of rare earth decreased with the increase
of the dosage of the carbonate precipitator.12−14 Thus, it was
another piece of evidence that the dissolution amount of rare earth
increased with the increase of the concentration of carbonate in solution.

Moreover, the ionic strength of the carbonate solution could also
affect the dissolution process of the rare earth. Rao et al.15 investigated the chemical balance behaviors
of Nd3+ in the solution system of Na+–Cl––CO32––HCO3– and found that at the same concentration
of sodium carbonate, the dissolution amount of rare earth was enhanced
with the existence of impurity salt sodium chloride, compared to without
sodium chloride. The higher the concentration of sodium chloride,
the more is the amount of rare earth dissolved. De Vasconcellos et
al.16 also noted that the higher concentration
of impurity ammonium anions increased the dissolution amount of rare
earth. In addition, according to Tang et al.’s result from
the research on rare-earth adsorption in water-bearing sand layer,17 it could be found that increased ionic strength
of the solution could cause weakening of the adsorption behavior of
rare earth on the sand layer because of the increase of the dissolution
amount of rare earth. Therefore, the ionic strength of the solution
was another important determinant in dissolving rare earth.18

Nevertheless, we discovered that the sodium
carbonate solution
which dissolved rare earth exhibited some unique metastable properties.
It had a metastable state period, in which rare earth could steadily
be dissolved into a carbonate solution, and did not generate the precipitates
of rare-earth carbonate. However, over the period, the precipitate
of rare-earth carbonate still formed. Nevertheless, the period could
be artificially controlled by changing the ionic strength of carbonate
solution via adjusting the condition of the circumstance of the solution
or enhancing the concentration of carbonate, which could affect the
dissolution process of rare earth.

Inspired by the differential
solubility in carbonate solution of
different rare-earth elements previously introduced, the artificial
domination of the metastable state period may have the potential application
and was feasibly utilized in rare-earth separation.

However,
existing reports of the dissolution of rare earth in carbonate
solution are mostly aimed at the chemical balance and rarely involved
in rare-earth separation. As for the metastable state, carbonate solution
which dissolved rare earth was basically lacking. To investigate the
regularity of the metastable state and provide a reference for the
development of new rare-earth separation methods, in this paper, the
neodymium was selected as the representative for rare-earth elements
and metastable dissolution regularity of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was systematically investigated. The
research on the interaction between various ions in solution was performed
using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.

2 Results
and Discussions
2.1 Metastable Dissolution
Regularity of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 Solution
2.1.1 Determination of Instantaneous Saturated
Solubility of Nd3+
The results showed that when
the NdCl3 solution was added into Na2CO3 solution, flocculent precipitates were formed first and were
then dissolved again with vigorous shaking. At this time, the solution
was in a clean state. It means that the Nd3+ completely
dissolved in Na2CO3 solution. From Figure 1, we can see that
there existed the maximum solubility point of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution.

Figure 1 Instantaneous saturated solubility of
Nd3+

However, when the additional
amount of Nd3+ exceeded
the maximum solubility point, the solution was no longer clear, and
a part of Nd3+ dissolved in the solution began to precipitate.
Moreover, we also observed that the solubility of Nd3+ in
Na2CO3 solution was not stable, and it would
decrease within a few minutes. As shown in Figure 1, the maximum solubilities of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solutions of 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 are 1.186, 2.394, and 3.566 g·L–1, respectively.

The generated precipitate was confirmed to
be NaNd(CO3)2 (see Section 2.1.4 and the FTIR result in Figure 6). According to the solubility
product of
NaNd(CO3)2 (log Ksp was −21.39),15 for the reaction  under the experimental condition,
the concentration
of sodium carbonate was 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 and the activity coefficient of sodium carbonate was calculated
to be 0.236, 0.205, and 0.188 via Pitzer theory,19 respectively. Then, the corresponding concentration of
Nd3+ in equilibrium was evaluated, and it should be 1.563
× 10–19, 1.911 × 10–19, and 2.450 × 10–19 g·L–1. Compared to the solubility we had measured, the deviation was quite
huge. Obviously, it was not the equilibrium concentration from the
dissolution process of NaNd(CO3)2. Hence, the
maximum solubility point was defined as instantaneous saturated solubility.

Furthermore, from the fitted result of the instantaneous saturated
solubility of Nd3+ with Na2CO3 concentration
in Figure 2, we could
see that the solubility of Nd3+ increased with the increase
of Na2CO3 concentration in the solution, and
it approached a significant linear relationship y = −1.18877 + 2.38043x because the R2 was 0.99992.

with the concentration
of CO32–.

2.1.2 Dissolution of Nd3+ with Time
In order to evaluate the dissolution of Nd3+ with time
in Na2CO3 solution, two experiments were carried
out. In the first one, the initial dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was controlled
to be equal to the instantaneous saturated solubility of Nd3+, which was 1.186, 2.394, and 3.566 g·L–1 in
1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, respectively (the experiments are named “Nd3+ saturated”). In the other one, the initial dissolution
concentration of Nd3+ was controlled to be lower than the
solubility, which was 0.734, 1.362, and 2.621 g·L–1 in 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, respectively (the experiments are named “Nd3+ unsaturated”).

As for Nd3+ saturated
dissolved in Na2CO3 solution, in the beginning,
all the Na2CO3 solution dissolved Nd3+ was in a clarification state, but the clarification period was truly
short. The solution precipitated gradually at the bottom of the conical
bottle as the standing time went on. From Figure 3, all the results illustrate that the Nd3+ concentration of Na2CO3 solution of
various concentrations showed a downward trend in the former 0–10
min stage. In addition, the decrease of the concentration of Nd3+ was slightly slower in the first 0–120 min but became
faster later. The reason may be that the precipitation and crystallization
need a crystal core, and the core was under the forming and growing
process initially. Later, the precipitation became faster because
abundant cores had been generated in the static process.

Figure 3 Time dependence
of the concentration of Nd3+ in the
saturated solution.

The consequence concluded
that the Nd3+ saturated dissolved
in Na2CO3 solution was not stable. However,
it could also be admitted that the solution was basically not in the
metastable state. Hence, the situation under this condition ought
not to be investigated in the following studies.

As for the
experiment of Nd3+ unsaturated dissolved
in Na2CO3 solution, the solution exhibited some
metastable characteristics. The solution was clean, and the Nd3+ was stable dissolved and did not precipitate with a period.
As shown in Figure 4, in the first 90 min, the solution was in the period of the metastable
state and the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ was almost
unchanged.

Figure 4 Time dependence of the concentration of Nd3+ in the
unsaturated solution.

However, this metastable state still had a time limit that
is called
the metastable period. The solution began to precipitate slowly after
the metastable period. For example, when the aging time was 120 min,
the concentration of Nd3+ in 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution was 0.708,
1.329, and 2.610 g·L–1, respectively. Compared
to the initial concentration, it was decreased slightly by only 3.47,
2.43, and 0.42%, but it was still a reduction, which indicates that
in the solution over the metastable period, the self-precipitation
occurred.

In addition, with the prolongation of the settling
time, the concentration
of Nd3+ in the solution reduced increasingly. For instance,
when the aging time reached 360 min, the corresponding concentration
of Nd3+ in 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution was 0.580, 1.220, and 2.501
g·L–1, respectively. The decrease of the concentration
of Nd3+ was significant, and the reduction ratios were
about 20.92, 10.43, and 4.58% approximately than the initial.

Compared with the previous instantaneous saturated data (see in Figure 3), it can be viewed
in Figure 4 that when
the dissolution Nd3+ did not reach the corresponding instantaneous
saturated solubility, the solutions with various concentrations of
Na2CO3 all possessed a metastable period. At
the same time, with the higher concentration of Na2CO3 solution, a longer metastable period was obtained. The solution
metastable period in 1 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution was 90 min, but in 1.5 and 2 mol·L–1, the metastable period was 120 min. Moreover, the
results could suggest that a higher concentration of Na2CO3 solution makes the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ become higher. As shown in Figure 4, the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution could reach 2.621 g·L–1 in
the metastable period, but in 1.5 mol·L–1,
the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was only 2.394 g·L–1.

2.1.3 Coordination Behavior of Nd3+ in the Metastable Solution
The UV–vis full-wavelength
scanning for the solution in a better metastable state, with 2.621
g·L–1 Nd3+ in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, which did not reach instantaneous
saturated solubility, was carried out. To provide experimental contrast,
the solution not in the metastable state, with 3.566 g·L–1 Nd3+ in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, which was equal to instantaneous
saturated solubility, was also scanned. The results are presented
in Figure 5.

Figure 5 UV–vis
spectrum of the solution (a) saturated and (b) unsaturated.

From Figure 5, we
could know whether the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was equal to or did not
reach instantaneous saturated solubility; there were two characteristic
peaks of neodymium20 found in the spectra
of samples at 340–370 nm, which were located at 349 and 357
nm. It is worth noting that the characteristic peaks of neodymium,
which was obtained from those Na2CO3 solutions
that dissolved Nd3+, were slightly red-shifted from 347
and 354 to 349 and 357 nm than the blank NdCl3 solution.
The reason was that the alkalinity of the solution dissolved Nd3+ was more than that of the blank NdCl3 solution.

Also, there were two characteristic peaks of neodymium20 at the wavelengths 524 and 575 nm in all the
samples. It should be noticed that the spectra of the samples of solution
dissolved Nd3+ showed a new stronger characteristic peak
at 583 nm, but it could not be found in the spectra of the blank sample.
Thus, the dissolution Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution has a significant coordination reaction with CO32–.

By referring to the results of Vercouter
and Vitorge’s21 studies on the equilibrium
steady-state dissolution
of rare earth in carbonate solution, we can know that Nd3+ could dissolve in high concentration Na2CO3 solution because the coordination reaction occurred between neodymium
and CO32– forms of the complex ions like
Ndn(CO3)m3n–2m.
Therefore, it can be further guessed that the existence of a metastable
state in Na2CO3 solution was probably due to
the complex coordination between neodymium and CO32–, which causes the dissolution Nd3+ to
not precipitate immediately.

2.1.4 Characterization
of Precipitates
During the typical aging period, the precipitates
formed from a metastable
state, in which 2.621 g·L–1 Nd3+ (not reached instantaneously saturated) dissolved in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, were collected
as samples and detected by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). To provide
experimental contrast, the precipitates, that were generated from
the solution with 3.566 g·L–1 Nd3+ (was equaled instantaneously saturated) dissolved in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, were also
collected and detected. The results are presented in Figure 6.

Figure 6 FTIR results of solid precipitates of neodymium (a) saturated and
(b) unsaturated.

From Figure 6, the
FTIR spectra of precipitates show that the characteristic infrared
peaks were consistent with the solid phase of blank sample NaNd(CO3)2, regardless of whether the initial dissolution
concentration of Nd3+ in the solution was equal to or did
not reach instantaneous saturated solubility.

The results were
also in agreement with the study of the equilibrium
steady-state solubility of rare earth in carbonate solution by Rao15,22 et al; that is, under the high concentration of CO32– solution environment, the stable solid phase in the
solution was only the complex salt NaNd(CO3)2, and Nd2(CO3)3 almost did not exist.

2.2 Simulation of the Mechanism of the Metastable
State
2.2.1 Establishment and Optimization of Metastable
Solution Models
Although the UV–vis full-wavelength
scanning results of the above solution samples can qualitatively explain
the dissolution behavior of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution, and combined with the previous literature, it can
also prove that Nd3+ in metastable solution did coordinate
with CO32–, the results cannot fully
explain the essence of the existence of a metastable state.

To explore the mechanism of the metastable state, the simulation
processes of the solution in a better metastable state, with 2.621
g·L–1 Nd3+ in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, which did not reach instantaneous
saturated solubility, were carried out by MD calculation using the
software Materials Studio. The blank Na2CO3 solution
only added water, and the solution that is not in the metastable state,
with 3.566 g·L–1 Nd3+ in 2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, which was
equal to instantaneous saturated solubility, was also simulated. All
the solution establishment parameters are listed in Table 1.

The energy changing of the solution model is shown
in Figure 8. According
to that,
we could know that in the optimization process, the overall energy
of each model decreased gradually with the increase of the optimization
steps, there was no large-scale energy disturbance, and the energy
tended to be stable at a low level in the end. This means that the
optimized solution model was at the lowest local energy level, and
the model could be considered to be in a relatively stable state.

2.2.2 MD Calculation Process
The temperature
changes of each solution model during the MD calculation are shown
in Figure 9. The temperature
of each solution model was raised first and then decreased steadily,
but the temperature of each solution model was all stable at 298 K
(±10%) at the end of calculation, and there was no significant
disturbance. It should be focused that the credibility of the solution
model dynamic is closely related to the corresponding termination
temperature. The result is credible while the temperature of the model
is within ±10% range of the initial at the end of the calculation.
Hence, the results were credible.

(a) saturated and (b) unsaturated.

The solution models after the MD calculation are shown in Figure 10.

Figure 10 Solution models after
the dynamic calculation (a) saturated, (b)
blank solution relates to saturated solution, (c) unsaturated, and
(d) blank solution relates to unsaturated solution.

As shown in Figure 10, the solution was homogeneous in general
after dynamic calculation.
However, in the local region, each component was not randomly and
evenly distributed in the solution. The interaction between ions (molecules)
result in varying degrees of agglomeration phenomenon at the local
level.

Among them, no matter what the dissolution level (saturated
or
unsaturated) of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution
is, the Nd3+ was all surrounded by CO32–, and it was coordinated by about 2–4 CO32–; the specific coordination situation is shown in Figure 11. This was consistent with
the results obtained from the full-wavelength UV–vis scan of
the solution sample before.

Figure 11 Coordination between neodymium and CO32– in the models (a) Nd(CO3)2–, (b) Nd(CO3)33–, and (c)
Nd(CO3)45–.

It was also confirmed with Vercouter and Vitorge’s
conclusion,21 which was that rare-earth
elements and CO32– coordination in high
concentration CO32– solution and all
kinds of complex ions
in the form of Ndn(CO3)m3n–2m (m ≥ 2) existed but in different
proportions.

In addition, all the solution models, including
corresponding blank
solutions, showed local agglomeration of CO32– distribution and a large number of Na+ distributed around
them. It could surmise that Na+ and CO32– did not dissociate completely in the circumstance
of the high concentration Na2CO3 solution, which
means that the free CO32– concentration
in the solution was at a low level.

2.2.3 Radial
Distribution Function and Coordination
Behaviors
The coordination behavior of neodymium with CO32– in high concentration Na2CO3 solution could be visually expressed by the solution model
after the MD calculation. To further quantify the interaction between
components in the solution model at the micro level, for the main
ion pairs in the solution, such as Nd3+–CO32–, Na+–CO32–, and Nd3+–Cl–, the analyses
of radial distribution function (RDF) were conducted using the Forcite.

As shown in Figure 12, the peak positions of RDF of Nd3+–CO32– in the solution were almost the same, regardless
of whether the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ was equal
to the instantaneous saturated solubility or unsaturated, but there
are still some strong differences. The first RDF peak of Nd3+–CO32– in saturated situation
was stronger than that in the unsaturated situation. This phenomenon
indicated that Nd3+ could bind more closely with CO32– at a closer microscopic distance.

Figure 12 RDF of Nd3+–CO32– ion pairs and
coordination situation (a) saturated and (b) unsaturated.

However, in the overall chemical bond range (r < 2.6 Å),23 the average
coordination
number of Nd3+ with CO32– at
the solution with Nd3+ saturated was about 2.37. It was
lower than the number 2.50, in which, the dissolution of Nd3+ in the solution was unsaturated. However, when Nd3+ saturated
dissolved in the solution, some of the dissolution Nd3+ precipitated and form NaNd(CO3)2 in a short
time, and the average coordination number of Nd3+ and CO32– in NaNd(CO3)2 is
2.0. Thus, the average coordination number of Nd3+ and
CO32– was lower. Correspondingly, when
the dissolution Nd3+ was unsaturated, the solution was
in a better metastable state, and the dissolution Nd3+ can
be stable in the solution for a long time; thus, the coordination
number was slightly higher.

From Figure 13,
it could be found that there was no interaction between Nd3+ and Cl– because the RDF strength was zero. In
this case, no matter whether dissolution Nd3+ was saturated
or not, there was no coordination behavior between Nd3+ and Cl–.

Figure 13 RDF of Nd3+–Cl– ion pairs and
coordination situation (a) saturated and (b) unsaturated.

Previous solution models had been able to visualize
the local agglomeration
of CO32–. By analyzing the RDF and the
average coordination of Na+–CO32– ion pairs, the essence of the metastable state could be further
elaborated. As shown in Figure 14, there was an interaction between Na+ and
CO32– in all solutions, and the corresponding
intensity peaks that appear in the RDF spectra were basically the
same, but the strength was also different. When the dissolution concentration
Nd3+ in the solution was equal to instantaneous saturated
solubility, the number of CO32– around
Na+ was about 1.27, which is the same with the corresponding
blank solution with only added water. However, when the dissolution
concentration Nd3+ did not reach the instantaneous saturated
solubility, the number of CO32– around
Na+ increased to 1.30 and that corresponding to the blank
solution with water increased to 1.33.

Figure 14 RDF of Na+–CO32– ion pairs and coordination
situation (a) saturated and the corresponding
blank solution and (b) unsaturated and the corresponding blank solution.

This phenomenon indicated that
the dissociation of CO32– in the solution
was strongly related to the
excess water added to the solution. When dissolution concentration
Nd3+ reaches instantaneous saturated solubility (3.566
g·L–1), the required volume of 10 g·L–1 NdCl3 was 14 mL, but the solution when
unsaturated (2.621 g·L–1) was only 9 mL. The
excess water diluted the high concentration Na2CO3 solution, resulting in more CO32– being
dissociated into the solution. That is to say, the concentration of
free CO32–, which could react with Nd3+ to generate precipitates in the solution, was further increased.
The interaction between Na+ and CO32– in the corresponding blank solution we had calculated could also
provide an evidence.

In other words, the total concentration
of CO32– in the solution was slightly
lower when the dissolution Nd3+ was saturated than when
the dissolution Nd3+ was unsaturated,
but the corresponding concentration of free CO32– that could react with Nd3+ to generate precipitates was
higher and causes the solution to become unstable. Therefore, the
higher concentration of CO32–, but the
lower concentration of free CO32– in
the Na2CO3 solution, was also one of the important
reasons for the existence of the solution metastable period.

3 Conclusions
In this work, the instantaneous
saturated solubility of Nd3+ in 1–2 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, metastable
dissolution regularity of Nd3+, and metastable mechanism
were investigated in detail. The
main conclusions are reproduced below.

First, instantaneous
saturation solubility of Nd3+ was positively correlated
with the concentration of Na2CO3 solution. In
1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mol·L–1 Na2CO3 solution, the solubility was 1.186,
2.394, and 3.566 g·L–1, respectively.

Second, when the initial dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in the solution was equal to the instantaneous saturated
solubility, the solution was not in the metastable period and the
dissolved Nd3+ precipitated quickly. However, when the
initial dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in the solution
did not reach the instantaneous saturated solubility, the solution
had a metastable period, and in that period, the dissolution of Nd3+ was stable, but it still had the precipitation behavior,
while beyond the period. Moreover, the precipitants obtained were
all in the form of NaNd(CO3)2.

And the
last, the coordination reaction between Nd3+ and CO32– occurred, and all kinds of
complex ions in the form Ndn(CO3)m3n–2m (m ≥ 2) existed, and the
interaction between Nd3+ and Cl– was
not found in the solution. The higher concentration of CO32– in the solution, but the lower concentration
of free CO32– that could react with neodymium
to generate precipitate, was an important reason for the existence
of the solution metastable state.

NdCl3 feed solution (10 g·L–1 ) was prepared by diluting the high purity solution with deionized
water. The analytical pure (AR) Na2CO3 was used
for the preparation of 1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 solution by using deionized water. The purity of other chemical
reagents, such as HCl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and
so on, was also of AR grade. The information on experimental equipment
is given in Table 3.

4.2 Metastable Dissolution
Regularity of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 Solution
4.2.1 Determination of Instantaneous Saturated
Solubility of Nd3+
Na2CO3 solutions (1, 1.5, and 2 mol·L–1 ) were selected
as a basal solution for dissolving Nd3+. Na2CO3 solution (25 mL) was put into a conical flask, and
then, 10 g·L–1 NdCl3 solution was
dropwise added into it by shaking the flask via an oscillator at 20–25
°C. First, the white precipitates of basic rare-earth carbonate
were formed and then dissolved with vigorous shaking. However, the
precipitates were generated again while the dissolution concentration
of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution attained
the instantaneous saturated solubility. At this time, the solution
was muddy and the addition of NdCl3 solution was stopped,
and then, a known amount of muddy solution was centrifuged with 6000
rpm for 5 min. After that, 5 mL of liquor was transferred and the
carbonate system was destroyed completely by using diluted HCl. Subsequently,
the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution was measured by EDTA titration or inductively
coupled plasma–optical emission spectroscopy (ICP–OES).

4.2.2 Dissolution of Nd3+ with Time
In order to control whether the dissolution concentration of Nd3+ was equal to or lower than the instantaneous saturated solubility,
a known volume of 10 g·L–1 NdCl3 solutions was dropwise added into Na2CO3 solution
with shaking, at 20–25 °C. After adding dropwise, the
static aging process was carried out and the time was set between
0 and 480 min. At the end of each aging time, a known amount of the
solution was transferred and centrifuged to get the liquor; subsequently,
5 mL of liquor was acidized completely by diluted HCl. The dissolution
concentration of Nd3+ in Na2CO3 solution
was titrated with EDTA or analyzed by ICP–OES.

4.2.3 Coordination Behavior of Nd3+ in the Metastable Solution
To monitor the coordination
behavior of Nd3+ quickly in the metastable solution, aqueous
samples in different aging time were collected and full-wavelength
scanned by using UV–vis. The blank solution, such as single
Na2CO3 and NdCl3 solution, was also
scanned.

4.2.4 Characterization of Precipitates
To investigate the formation of precipitates of basic rare-earth
carbonate generated from the metastable solution, precipitate samples
in different aging times were collected and detected by FTIR. It should
be noticed that the precipitates samples were prestored in deionized
water to prevent them from decomposition. Before analyzing, the water
was completely removed by sucking filtration, and the samples were
analyzed immediately.

4.3 Simulation of the Mechanism
of the Metastable
State
4.3.1 Establishment and Optimization of Metastable
Solution Models
Materials Studio 8.0 is powerful software
for material simulation and modeling and is developed by Accelrys.24 In this section, all the components of the metastable
solution, such as H2O, CO32–, Nd3+, Na+, and Cl–, were
established by the Visualizer and optimized under the universal force
field by Forcite in software Materials Studio 8.0. After the establishment
and optimization process of the components, the solution box model
was built, and the well-optimized components were added into the box
via an amorphous cell. The values of density and the concentration
of each component were settled by following the actual metastable
solution. Subsequently, the geometry optimization of the solution
model was performed. Also, the blank solutions, which were the Na2CO3 solution with only added water, were also established
and optimized. During the optimization step, it was necessary to check
whether the energy of the system was converted smoothly to a lower
energy state.

4.3.2 MD Calculation Process
The MD calculation
was conducted by Forcite after the optimization of the solution models.
The calculation ensemble was NVT. The simulation
temperature was 298 K, and the time was set at 20 ps and calculated
once per 1 fs. The parameters of the initial heating rate and temperature
control sets were selected at Random and Andersen. To save experimental
time, the accuracy of calculation was chosen as a middle. At the end
of the calculation, it was necessary to verify whether the result
of the dynamic calculation is credible. When the temperature is stable
at the range of 298 ± 29.8 K in the end and there is no large
temperature disturbance, the calculation result is credible; otherwise,
it needs to be recalculated.

4.3.3 RDF
and Coordination Behaviors
The schematic diagram of the RDF25 is
presented in Figure 15. After the MD calculation, the RDF analysis was carried out. Utilizing
the formula 1 to establish the relationship
between the results of RDF analysis and the coordination behaviors,
the average coordination number between each component was obtained.
The entire simulation flowchart is shown in Figure 16. 1  N(L) refers
to the number of coordination atoms (molecules) in the 0–L spherical shell around the target atom. ρ refers
to the number density of coordination atoms (molecules), and the value
is the ratio of the number of atoms (molecules) to the volume of space. g(r) refers to the RDF value, and it indicates
the probability of the occurrence of coordination atoms (molecules)
within a certain distance. r refers to the cutoff
radius.
