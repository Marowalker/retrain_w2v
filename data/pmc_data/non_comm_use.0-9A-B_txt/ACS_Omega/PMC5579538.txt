The ubiquitin conjugating
enzyme Ube2g2 together with its cognate
E3 ligase gp78 catalyzes the synthesis of lysine-48 polyubiquitin
chains constituting signals for the proteasomal degradation of misfolded
proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we employ NMR spectroscopy
in combination with single-turnover diubiquitin formation assays to
examine the role of the RING domain from gp78 in the catalytic activation
of Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates. We find that approximately 60% of
the Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates occupy a closed conformation in the
absence of gp78-RING, with the population increasing to 82% upon gp78-RING
binding. As expected, strong mutations in the hydrophobic patch residues
of the ∼Ub moiety result in Ube2g2∼Ub populating only
open states with corresponding loss of the ubiquitin conjugation activity.
Less disruptive mutations introduced into the hydrophobic patch of
the ∼Ub moiety also destabilize the closed conformational state,
yet the corresponding effect on the ubiquitin conjugation activity
ranges from complete loss to an enhancement of the catalytic activity.
These results present a picture in which Ube2g2’s active site
is in a state of continual dynamic flux with the organization of the
active site into a catalytically viable conformation constituting
the rate-limiting step for a single ubiquitin ligation event. Ube2g2’s
function as a highly specific K48-polyubiquitin chain elongator leads
us to speculate that this may be a strategy by which Ube2g2 reduces
the probability of nonproductive catalytic outcomes in the absence
of available substrate.

Introduction
Polyubiquitylation
is a major post-translational mechanism by which
eukaryotic cells respond to external stresses and stimuli. The nature
of the response varies widely depending on the site of substrate ubiquitylation
as well as the specific construction of the polyubiquitin signal.1−3 Well-established examples include the involvement of lysine-63 (K63)-linked
polyubiquitin chains in mediating DNA repair and endocytosis and the
role of K48- and K11-linked polyubiquitin chains in the targeting
of substrates for proteasomal degradation.4,5 Proper
function of the ubiquitylation system is an important bulwark against
disease progression.6,7

The construction of the
appropriate polyubiquitin chain and its
attachment to the proper substrate is carried out by a cascade of
enzymatic reactions. This process begins with the C-terminal adenylation
of ubiquitin by an ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) followed by the
formation of a thioester linkage to the E1 enzyme. This activated
ubiquitin molecule is then transferred to the active site cysteine
of one of the several dozen ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s) again
making a thioester linkage. The charged E2 (denoted E2∼Ub)
then typically goes on to promote the catalysis of an isopeptide bond
between the C-terminal carboxylate of the ∼Ub moiety and the
ε-amino group of a lysine residue residing on either substrate
protein or another ubiquitin molecule. This step is carried out in
conjunction with a ubiquitin ligase (E3), with the outcome depending
on the identity of the involved E2 and E3 enzymes. A large majority
of E3 ligases contain a so-called RING domain, which is capable of
binding different E2 enzymes by means of a conserved interface. Given
that there are many hundreds of different E3 enzymes, a major question
is what factors govern the collaboration of the proper E2 and E3 enzymes
to produce the desired outcome.

In addition to its role in the
recruitment of the E2∼Ub
conjugate, RING-E3s also strongly activate E2∼Ub reactivity
in a manner that is not completely understood.8−11 It is now generally recognized
that many E2∼Ubs must be capable of assuming a closed conformation
in which the hydrophobic patch of the ∼Ub moiety interacts
with the E2 at an interface centered on its α2 helix. For a
number of different E2s, including Ubc1, Ube2e3, Ube2e1, Ube2n, and
Ube2g2,12−14 it has been shown that the destabilization of this
closed conformation by mutations either in the E2’s α2
helix or in the hydrophobic patch of ∼Ub abolishes or strongly
diminishes the catalytic activity. Furthermore, there is evidence
that binding of a RING-E3 promotes the formation of this closed conformation.13,15,16 The recognition that the conformation
of E2∼Ub in the presence of a cognate RING-E3 ligase is essential
to function has driven the development of approaches for stabilizing
the covalent linkage between Ub and E2 so that structural studies
can be carried out. Strategies that have been employed include replacement
of the thioester linkage with ester,17−19 disulfide,20 or isopeptide16,21,22 linkages.

X-ray crystallographic structures
of several E3/E2∼Ub ternary
complexes have now been determined.17−19,16,21,23 Among the RING-E3 structures a common theme is the observation of
a closed E2∼Ub conformation, which is stabilized by direct
interaction with the bound RING.16,21,23 These studies confirm directly the ability of E2∼Ub
conjugates to assume a closed conformation mediated by the hydrophobic
patch of the donor ubiquitin and the α2 helix of the E2. Mutations
designed to destabilize these interactions lead to reductions in activity,
suggesting that these structures correspond to the activated conformation
of the ternary complex. A similar ternary interaction has been reported
in the case of Ube2g2 charged with Ub and bound to gp78-RING.22 The existence of ternary E2, ∼Ub, and
RING interactions is not universal, however, as it is not observed
when E4B or BRCA1 RING domains interact with Ube2e3∼Ub.13

A dynamic picture of the E2∼Ub
conformation that has emerged
from the NMR studies complements the view obtained from these static
structures. It appears that many E2∼Ub conjugates undergo extensive
conformational fluctuations, with the nature of the fluctuations depending
on the specific E2. The NMR studies carried out for Ubc1∼Ub12 and Ubc13∼Ub17 conjugates clearly show an substantial interaction between the ∼Ub
moiety and the region surrounding the α2 helix of the corresponding
E2 in a solution. Yet, the observed linebroadening indicates that
these conjugates are in dynamic equilibrium with other presumably
more open conformational states. The NMR studies of Ube2e3∼Ub,17,24 on the other hand, conclude that the interaction between E2 and
∼Ub is relatively weak and nonspecific. Indeed, the predominant
conformation is open enough so that UbcH5c∼Ub tends to form
linear oligomers mediated by noncovalent interaction of the ∼Ub
moiety of one conjugate with the E2’s backside Ub-binding site
of another.18,24 Similarly, oligomerization has
been reported for Rad6∼Ub25 conjugates.
Alternative modes of interaction have also been reported, such as
contacts between Ub and the α3 helix of UbcH8 in the UbcH8∼Ub
conjugates.20 Taken together, these studies
suggest that E2∼Ub conjugates sample a wide variety of conformational
states in addition to the putative closed state conformation required
for catalytic activity.

The relationship between E2∼Ub
conformation and catalytic
function is an important question. It has now been shown that binding
of a RING-E3 can influence the conformational dynamics of some E2∼Ub
conjugates. The NMR titration of the BIRC7 RING domain into a solution
of Ube2e2∼[15N]-Ub shows chemical shift perturbations
(CSPs) consistent with an increase in Ube2e2/∼Ub interactions
as well as direct ∼Ub/RING interactions.16 Upon addition of the U-box domain of the E3 ligase E4B
(E4BU) to Ube2e3∼Ub, CSPs are observed corresponding to the
α2 helix of UbcH5c and the hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin consistent
with the E4BU-induced closure of Ube2e3∼Ub.13,15 In addition, formation of a hydrogen bond between a conserved arginine
residue on E4BU and the backbone of Ube2e3 is found to be essential
for the activation of Ube2e3. Subsequent NMR spin relaxation studies
demonstrate that E4BU binding restricts the breadth of the Ube2e3∼Ub
dynamic ensemble toward a more compact distribution while still remaining
in dynamic equilibrium between closed and open states. Moreover, the
change in conformational distribution is independent of whether a
wild-type or an activation-incompetent mutant of E4BU is employed,
suggesting an intricate, multifactor mechanism for Ube2e3∼Ub
activation.15

Here, we investigate
the interaction of native thioester-linked
Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates with the RING domain from the E3 enzyme
gp78. This E2/E3 pair function as a part of the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) quality control pathway in which the conjugates specifically
catalyze the synthesis of K48-polyubiquitin chains prior to transfer
onto the substrate proteins.26−29 We have employed NMR spectroscopic methods and single-turnover
diubiquitin formation kinetic assays to specifically examine the relationship
between the Ube2g2∼Ub conformational ensemble, gp78-RING binding,
and catalytic efficiency.

Results
The catalytic activity of
Ube2g2 depends on the integrity of the
so-called hydrophobic patch of the donor ubiquitin molecule linked
to the Ube2g2 active site.30 This requirement
has now been observed for a number of different E2 enzymes (UbcH5a,21 UbcH5b,16 UbcH5c,13 Ube2r1,30,31 and Ube2s30). Furthermore, the Ube2g2 activity is both highly
dependent on the presence of a cognate RING domain and highly specific
for the ligation of two ubiquitin molecules by means of a K48 linkage
(Figure S3). When Ube2g2 is charged with
a ubiquitin molecule bearing a K48R mutation (Ub* is used herein to
denote Ub-K48R), it remains inactive provided no ubiquitin molecules
bearing a native K48 residue are present. We have developed a protocol
that allows Ube2g2 to be charged by the means of a native thioester
linkage to a donor-specific ubiquitin molecule (Ub*) at the concentrations
suitable for NMR spectroscopy. These conjugates (Ube2g2∼Ub*)
can be maintained for at least 4 h at pH 8.3 in the presence of gp78-RING
without significant hydrolysis, allowing two-dimensional (2D) chemical
shift correlation experiments to be carried out. This approach enables
the NMR spectroscopic investigation of the interaction of Ube2g2 with
a covalently linked donor Ub* molecule in the absence and presence
of the RING domain from the E3 ligase gp78.

Determination of the Ube2g2/gp78-RING
Binding Interface
Our initial NMR investigations focused
on investigating the interaction
between gp78-RING and Ube2g2 by 2D-[15N,1H]-transverse
relaxation-optimized spectroscopy-heteronuclear single-quantum correlation
(TROSY-HSQC) spectroscopy. Addition of unlabeled gp78-RING into a
solution of 70%-2H,15N-labeled Ube2g2 produced
chemical shift perturbations of the resonances corresponding to residues
residing in helix α1 as well as loops 4 and 7. These measured
CSPs are depicted in Figure 1a, and the corresponding residues having a CSP > 0.3 ppm
are
shown in red in a surface representation of Ube2g2 in Figure 1b. The observed RING-binding
site for Ube2g2 corresponds to the canonical RING recognition interface
and agrees closely with the observations for other E2 enzymes.29,32,33

NMR CSP Study of Ube2g2∼Ub* Thioester Formation
Initiation
of the thioester formation reaction in the NMR tube between
unlabeled donor Ub* and 70%-2H,15N-labeled Ube2g2
leads to extensive changes in the [15N,1H]-TROSY-HSQC
spectrum of Ube2g2. Progression of the reaction is easily monitored
as the active site C89 amide resonance in Ube2g2 is well resolved
and experiences a large CSP of approximately 3 ppm upon thioester
formation. Shown in Figure 2b are the expanded spectral regions illustrating the sort
of CSPs observed upon thioester formation (black to red peaks). Significant
CSPs resulting from Ube2g2∼Ub* formation are observed in several
different regions of the Ube2g2 sequence (Figure 2a), and in addition, a number of resonances
disappear in the vicinity of the residues 95–110 and 120–135.
A surface plot of Ube2g2, given in cyan and blue to depict these perturbations,
shows that they include residues that are both proximal to and remote
from the site of covalent modification (Figure 2c). These perturbations form a contiguous
patch that is consistent with an interaction with the covalently linked
∼Ub* moiety. No evidence of such an interaction is seen in
the absence of a thioester linkage between Ube2g2 and Ub*. Notably,
the surface affected upon thioester formation does not overlap with
but rather nearly adjoins the RING-binding interface (compare Figures 1b and 2c), consistent with the direct interaction of gp78-RING and
the ∼Ub moiety as reported by Das et al.22

amide resonance of C89 are off scale. Measured values are 3 and 2.8
ppm with and without RING, respectively. (B) Overlaid 2D-[15N,1H]-TROSY-HSQC subspectra acquired at 800 MHz for 200

indicate the trajectory of the resulting CSPs. (C) Pymol surface representation
of Ube2g2 (PDB: 2KLY) illustrating the effects of charging of Ube2g2 with Ub* in the
presence of gp78-RING. Residues for which measured CSPs > 0.3 ppm,
from panel (A), are given in cyan, whereas Ube2g2 residues for which
the corresponding resonances either broaden out or are too weak to
be unambiguously assigned are given in blue.

Subsequent addition of unlabeled gp78-RING to Ube2g2∼Ub*
produces CSPs encompassing residues corresponding to the union of
CSPs observed separately upon gp78-RING binding and thioester formation
(compare Figures 1a
and 2a). However, many residues that are perturbed
upon thioester formation exhibit an increase in the measured CSP upon
subsequent RING binding while preserving the same spectral trajectory
(resonances shown in green in Figure 2b). Furthermore, the resonances that disappear upon
the formation of Ube2g2∼Ub* are not recovered upon gp78-RING
binding. These results suggest strongly that Ube2g2∼Ub* is
in dynamic equilibrium between the states in which the ∼Ub*
interacts with Ube2g2 (closed state) and the “open”
states in which it does not, with gp78-RING binding causing an increase
in the closed state population.

NMR CSP Study of Ube2g2∼Ub*-L8AI44A
Thioester Formation
The identical experiment was carried
out utilizing a donor ubiquitin
molecule with a doubly mutated hydrophobic patch (i.e., Ube2g2∼Ub*-L8AI44A).
Notably, the observed spectral perturbations (Figure 3b) are reduced substantially relative to
the results for the Ub* donor molecule. Shown in Figure 3a are the measured CSPs upon
thioester formation and with gp78-RING bound as well. Perturbed resonances
are localized to residues in the region surrounding the active site
and at the gp78-RING binding interface (Figure 3c). Notably, no CSPs were observed for regions
remote from the active site. Furthermore, the measured CSPs for gp78-RING/Ube2g2∼Ub*-L8AI44A
correspond closely to the vectorial sum of the separately measured
CSPs for Ube2g2/RING and Ube2g2∼Ub*-L8AI44A. These results
suggest that the donor moiety of Ube2g2∼Ub*-L8AI44A is incapable
of interacting with Ube2g2 by means of its hydrophobic patch and thus
exclusively occupies an open, functionally incompetent, conformation
as reported for other E2s.21,16,13,30,31,30

(A), are given in cyan, whereas Ube2g2 residues for which the corresponding
resonances either broaden out or are too weak to be unambiguously
assigned are given in blue.

Determination of gp78-RING Binding Affinities
We propose
a simple model for RING-induced closure of Ube2g2∼Ub* in Figure 4. In this model,
the observed increase in closed state population results from a difference
in the affinity for gp78-RING between the open and closed state conformations
of Ube2g2∼Ub*. This change in affinity results from a direct
contact between the gp78-RING domain and the ∼Ub* moiety in
the closed state and potentially other factors as well. As the affinity
of Ube2g2 for gp78-RING depends on both pH and Mg++ concentration,
a titration was carefully carried out such that the affinities of
Ube2g2 and Ube2g2∼Ub are measured on the same sample differing
only by the addition of E1 to initiate thioester formation. Unlabeled
Ub* and Ub*-L8AI44A were utilized as donors for 2H,15N-labeled Ube2g2 with calibrated aliquots of unlabeled gp78-RING
added to independent NMR samples. This allows for the determination
of any relative changes in the affinity to be established with a much
higher confidence. The affinities resulting from a combined fit of
all residues exhibiting a maximum CSP > 0.15 ppm are summarized
in Table 1. The results
show
that the affinity of Ube2g2 for gp78-RING increases approximately
3-fold upon thioester formation with Ub* as the donor molecule. When
Ub*-L8AI44A is utilized as the donor, the affinity change is marginally
outside our estimated precision of measurement. We speculate that
this may be due to weak noncovalent interaction between gp78-RING
and free Ub in a solution. Representative fits to the gp78-RING titration
data are shown in Figure 5. These fits underscore the general observation that the nature
of gp78-RING/Ube2g2 binding remains unchanged upon thioester bond
formation with a Ub*-L8AI44A donor ubiquitin, unlike the case of an
unmutated donor ubiquitin (Ub*).

Figure 4 Hypothetical model for gp78-RING activation
of Ube2g2∼Ub
function. The Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates dynamically fluctuate between
closed and open conformations populated according to the equilibrium
constant K. This equilibrium shifts toward the closed
state upon RING binding as a result of an increased affinity of gp78-RING
for Ube2g2∼Ub when it is closed rather than open potentially
due to direct ∼Ub/RING contacts.

Estimation
of Closed State Populations
It is tempting
to speculate that one of the features of Ube2g2 activation upon gp78-RING
binding is the transition of Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates from a dynamically
populated ensemble of conformations to a fully closed conformation,
which is catalytically viable. On their own, the NMR CSP data do not
allow one to determine whether the RING-bound state of Ube2g2∼Ub*
is entirely closed. Yet, assuming that the free Ube2g2 affinity for
gp78-RING is an adequate proxy for the affinity operative for the
open state of Ube2g2∼Ub* and the model of Figure 4 holds, the measured change
in the affinity between charged and uncharged states of Ube2g2 can
be related to the ratio, n, of equilibrium constants
describing the relative populations of closed and open states of Ube2g2∼Ub*
in the presence and absence of bound gp78-RING. This allows the equilibrium
constant, K, relating the populations of the closed
and open states of Ube2g2∼Ub* to be estimated according to 1  in which r is the experimentally
determined ratio of CSPs for Ube2g2∼Ub* in the presence and
absence of RING. We have identified 8 residues (G23, M42, G43, E45,
D46, T47, F51, and G52) that are perturbed by Ube2g2∼Ub closure,
yet they do not directly experience gp78-RING binding and are remote
from the active site. Taking the average of CSP measurements corresponding
to these residues (Table S4), a value of r = 1.37 ± 0.09 is obtained. In combination with the
measured ratio of RING affinities (n = 3.05 ±
0.30), a value for K of 1.5 ± 0.8 is obtained.
This equilibrium constant K is related to the corresponding
population according to K/(K + 1).
On the basis of this analysis, we estimate that in the absence of
gp78-RING, 60% of Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates populate the closed
state. Binding of gp78-RING causes Ube2g2∼Ub* to become more
closed (82%), yet open conformational states are still dynamically
populated.

Single-Turnover Kinetics Study of Diubiquitin
Formation for
Different Donor Mutants
To further explore the role of the
interaction between the hydrophobic patch of the donor ubiquitin in
Ube2g2∼Ub activation, four additional donor Ub hydrophobic
patch mutants were created (Ub*-V70A, Ub*-L8A, Ub*-I44A, and Ub*-I44V)
in addition to Ub*-L8AI44A. The rate of diubiquitin formation for
each mutant was then quantified by means of the single-turnover kinetics
assay shown in Figure 6A. We have found that the addition of ethylene diamine tetra-acetic
acid and NEM to prevent the recharging of Ube2g2 renders a fraction
of the Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates inactive. Instead, we quench the
reaction by the addition of 15 U/mL hexokinase followed by the addition
of gp78-RING and an acceptor ubiquitin molecule bearing an Oregon
Green chromophore (OG-Ub) to allow quantification of diubiquitin formation
by fluorescence. The initial rates of diubiquitin formation were measured
at different concentrations of gp78-RING (Figure 6B) and then the kinetic parameters were determined
according to a standard Michaelis–Menten analysis. This enabled
the estimation of diUb formation velocities corresponding to gp78-RING
saturated conditions. The resulting kinetic parameters are listed
in Table 2. For three
of the mutants (Ub*-L8AI44A, Ub*-L8A, and Ub*-I44A), the diubiquitin
formation activity was effectively abolished. On the other hand, the
most conservative mutant (Ub*-I44V) resulted in an unchanged diubiquitin
formation activity relative to the wild-type donor Ub*. Unexpectedly,
the donor ubiquitin bearing a V70A mutation exhibited a doubling in
the rate of diubiquitin formation under gp78-RING saturated conditions.

of diubiquitin formation depend strongly on the specific

addition of gp78-RING and 1 μM ubiquitin modified to bear an
Oregon Green chromophore to allow the quantification by fluorescence.

NMR CSP Study of Ube2g2∼Ub*-X Donor Mutants
Two-dimensional-[15N,1H]-TROSY-HSQC NMR spectroscopy
was performed on Ube2g2 conjugated, respectively, to the different
donor ubiquitin mutants to examine the relationship between the population
of the closed conformational state and the ability to catalyze diubiquitin
formation. In these experiments, only Ube2g2 was isotopically labeled,
whereas the specific donor ubiquitin and gp78-RING remained unlabeled.
The question was whether mutations in the hydrophobic patch destabilize
the closed state conformation in a manner that correlates with the
observed loss or gain of catalytic competence. Figure 7 shows an overview of the results for the
four donor mutants Ub*-I44V, Ub*-I44A, Ub*-L8A, and Ub*-V70A. Most
striking is that all of the mutants (compare NMR overlaid subspectra
shown in Figures 2, 3, and 7) exhibit significant
weakening or disappearance of the hydrophobic patch mediated binding
between the donor ubiquitin molecule and Ube2g2. This is best seen
by consideration of the measured CSPs for the region furthest from
the active site, which includes residues such as G23, G43, and T47.
From this perspective, the Ub*-I44A, Ub*-V70A, and Ub*-L8AI44A mutants
are not observed to populate the closed state conformation at all.
On the other hand, it could be argued that the Ub*-I44V and Ub*-L8A
mutants do still populate the closed state, albeit to a greatly diminished
extent. This is based on the CSPs observed for the amide N–H
of residue T47 (Figure 7b,c, upper right panel), which is very remote from the active site
and thus a reasonable probe for closing. However, upon a close examination
of all measured CSPs, we conclude that only Ub*-I44V displays a CSP
signature similar to Ub*, whereas Ub*-L8A exhibits notable differences.
Although it is not possible to draw more detailed conclusions from
these data, what is striking is that these NMR spectroscopic observations
are totally discordant with the measured rates of diubiquitin formation
among the different donor ubiquitin mutants. That is, all of the mutants
studied have small to nonexistent closed state populations, whereas
the observed catalytic rates range from negligible to twice that observed
for Ub* in the case of Ub*-V70A.

gp78-RING/Ube2g2∼Ub*-X (green). At the bottom of each panel
are pymol surface representations of Ube2g2 (PDB: 2KLY) illustrating the
effects of charging of Ube2g2 with the operative donor mutant Ub*-X
in the presence of gp78-RING. Residues for which measured CSPs >
0.3
ppm are given in cyan, whereas Ube2g2 residues for which the corresponding
resonances either broaden out or are too weak to be unambiguously
assigned are given in blue. Each panel shows the results for a specific
donor mutant: (A) Ub*-V70A. (B) Ub*-I44V. (C) Ub*-L8A. (D) Ub*-I44A.

In addition to the resonances
that shift upon thioester formation,
there are a number of those that broaden out and disappear. Corresponding
residues are located either proximal to the active site or in the
region of the α2 helix, which is the center of the donor ubiquitin
binding site. The observation of a significant line broadening can
be considered to be indicative of significant conformational fluctuations
occurring on the microsecond to millisecond time scale. We have carried
out a close examination of the TROSY-NMR data to identify which resonances
experience substantial conformational exchange broadening, manifesting
as either complete disappearance or significant reduction in intensity.
These regions are displayed in dark blue on a surface representation
of Ube2g2 in Figures 2, 3, and 7. The two
mutants with the least conformational exchange broadening are Ub*-I44A
and Ub*-L8AI44A, suggesting that they are strongly biased toward the
occupation of an array of open conformations with minor interactions
with Ube2g2. Notably, all three functional Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates
(i.e., bearing Ub*, Ub*-I44V, and Ub*-V70A) show quite similar regions
of exchange broadening, which one might propose as corresponding to
the conformational fluctuations associated with the reorganization
of the functionally relevant active site. The Ub*-L8A donor mutant,
although exhibiting a larger region of exchange broadening relative
to I44A-containing mutants, still exhibits a less extensive region
than the active mutants. We speculate that the interaction is sufficiently
different to preclude fruitful active site reorganization. Viewed
from this vantage point, the results are in better alignment with
the measured rates of diubiquitin formation and lend support to a
view of Ube2g2 function in which certain contacts must be present
between Ube2g2 and the ∼Ub moiety to allow for constructive
active site rearrangement. Formation of these essential contacts is
likely driven by the closure of Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates, but apparently
a priori interaction of the hydrophobic patch of the ∼Ub moiety
with the α2 region of Ube2g2 is not strictly necessary.

Discussion
Our results demonstrate that, when charged, Ube2g2 interacts directly
with the hydrophobic patch of its covalently linked ∼Ub moiety.
This closed conformation is transient and in dynamic equilibrium with
other open conformations. Furthermore, NMR CSP analysis shows that
the conformational distribution of Ube2g2∼Ub shifts toward
the closed state upon binding of the RING domain from the E3 ligase
gp78. Sufficient disruption of the closed conformation by means of
mutations of the hydrophobic patch of the donor ubiquitin abolishes
Ube2g2’s RING-dependent catalytic activity as observed for
a number of other E2 enzymes.13,16,21,30,31 These observations support the crystallographic structures of RING/E2∼Ub
ternary complexes16,21 as well as a model of gp78-RING/Ube2g2∼Ub,22 suggesting that RING binding stabilizes a catalytically
competent state in which the donor ubiquitin is in direct contact
with the E2 enzyme. These results are also in accordance with the
NMR-based studies showing that E2∼Ub conjugates are in dynamic
equilibrium between open and closed states with the binding of RING
causing a bias in the population toward the closed state.13,15

We measured a 3-fold increase in the affinity of gp78-RING
for
Ube2g2∼Ub relative to Ube2g2 alone, which agrees very closely
with that reported by Byrd and co-workers.22 Preferential binding of RING domains to E2 enzymes in their Ub-charged
state appears to be a common theme, although there are some exceptions.13 Affinity increases upon charging have been reported
for the BIRC7/UbcH5b∼Ub16 and Rbx1/Roc1/CDC34∼Ub34 systems, both of which exhibit ternary contacts
between the RING, E2, and Ub components. In the BIRC7/UbcH5b study,
it was shown that destabilization of the closed conformation by hydrophobic
patch mutations of the conjugated donor ubiquitin reduced the affinity
for BIRC7 RING.16 Likewise, we find here
that Ube2g2 charged with a Ub-L8AI44A mutant has nearly the same affinity
for gp78-RING as for Ube2g2 alone. As such, we have considered a simple
model in which the observed increase in RING affinity for Ube2g2∼Ub
conjugates is energetically linked to the stabilization of the closed
conformation upon RING binding. On the basis of this analysis, we
conclude that gp78-RING binding to Ube2g2∼Ub increases the
fractional population of the closed state from approximately 60 to
82%. Our conclusion that Ube2g2∼Ub remains in dynamic equilibrium
between closed and open states even while gp78-RING is bound is in
agreement with the conclusion of Soss et al. in the case of the E4BU/UbcH5∼Ub
complex.15

The enhancement of an
E2 enzyme’s catalytic activity resulting
from RING binding is typically many orders of magnitude. Clearly,
the change in the closed state population of Ube2g2∼Ub upon
RING binding is not a significant factor for activation. The primary
factor for activation is likely a conserved hydrogen bond present
in several E3/E2 pairs as proposed by Klevit and co-workers.13 Indeed, a study of Ube2g2 activation by gp78
has established the presence of a salt bridge between the Ube2g2 residue
E108 and the gp78 residue R379, as well as direct RING/∼Ub
interactions.22 Our results are fully consistent
with the existence of ternary contacts between Ube2g2, gp78-RING,
and the ∼Ub moiety in the closed state. The significant feature
of our results is not the modest change in the closed state population
upon RING binding, but rather the fact that Ube2g2∼Ub remains
dynamic even when RING is bound.

To probe the role of Ube2g2∼Ub
closure on function, we examined
five different donor ubiquitin molecules bearing mutations to their
hydrophobic patch. Our results are in agreement with the reports of
the loss of activity for donor Ub molecules with L8A and I44A mutations.13,14,16,21,30,31 Our observed
increase in the activity in the case of Ub*-V70A is a surprising result
at odds with most reports to date. However, a study of the yeast Ubc7
along with the cognate RING domains Doa10 and Hrd1 found that in the
case of Hrd1 (but not Doa10), Ubc7∼Ub*-V70A was fully active,
whereas Ubc7∼Ub*-L8A retained some activity. Ubc7 is the yeast
ortholog of Ube2g2, exhibiting 79% sequence homology,14 whereas Hrd1 is the ortholog of gp78.35 Apparently, there are features of the gp78-mediated activation
of Ube2g2 that are not shared with other E2/E3 pairs.

Our results
demonstrate no relationship between the population
of a closed Ube2g2∼Ub conformation as observed by NMR spectroscopy
and catalytic function as quantified by our single-turnover kinetics
assay. We propose that the results be viewed simply in terms of whether
a specific donor mutant is able to undergo mutual reorganization of
its own C-terminal tail with the Ube2g2 active site into the catalytically
important conformation. The apparent importance of the Ube2g2∼Ub
closed state then arises due to the reduction of the conformational
rearrangement space available. In essence, closure of the Ube2g2∼Ub
conjugate acts to guide the required active site rearrangement. From
this vantage point, the donor Ub mutants that exhibit loss of function
(Ub*-I44A, Ub*-L8A, and Ub*-L8AI44A) do so because they are sampling
mostly open conformations, or alternative closed state conformations
from which the catalytically active conformation is not accessible.
The Ub*-I44V donor mutant has diubiquitin ligation activity, which
is essentially identical to the wild-type because it does sample the
closed conformation, although with a much lower fractional population.
This lack of correlation between the closed state population and catalytic
activity suggests a process governed by the operative kinetic rates
of opening and closing. This suggests a possible explanation for the
surprising enhancement in activity observed for the Ub*-V70A mutant.
Further experiments are required to test this possibility. Preliminary
results indicate that the introduction of a V70A mutation is not capable
of rescuing a catalytically inactive donor ubiquitin (specifically
Ub*-L8AI44AV70A as donor) (Figure S4).

This work did not explore in detail aspects of the catalytic mechanism
involving binding and recognition of the acceptor Ub molecule. It
has been presumed that the aspects relating to acceptor Ub recognition
are independent and catalytically downstream of gp78-RING binding,
Ube2g2∼Ub closure, and subsequent active site reorganization.
Yet, it remains that the acceptor ubiquitin could play an important
role in this active site reorganization as seen in Ube2s,30 or when it is covalently linked to the active
site of a second Ube2g2 molecule.36 Although
the NMR experiments were carried out with a stoichiometric excess
of ubiquitin present, the diubiquitin kinetics assays were performed
at a 1:10 ratio of OG-Ub/Ube2g2∼Ub* in large part because the
reaction proceeds too fast to be followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) at higher Ub concentrations.
Indeed, we observed that the rate of reaction is approximately linear
with the acceptor Ub concentration and have estimated an affinity
of 1 mM for the acceptor Ub binding based on the measurement of Ki with Ub* as the competitive inhibitor (data
not shown). Considered together with the lack of correlation between
the kinetics results and the observed closed state populations, we
propose that the active site rearrangement, facilitated by Ube2g2∼Ub
closure, is the rate-limiting step for Ub-to-Ub ligation by Ube2g2.

Our conclusion that Ube2g2∼Ub remains in a dynamic equilibrium
between open and closed states even when gp78-RING is bound could
have a significant functional relevance in that it could substantially
reduce the rate of hydrolysis or the undesired side reactions by maintaining
the active site in a state of dynamic reorganization. Recently, it
has been shown that Ube2g2, in collaboration with oligomeric assemblies
of gp78, elongates polyUb chains from the distal end of the chain,
which is, in turn, positioned by interactions with the CUE domain
of gp78.37,38 Furthermore, the donor Ube2g2∼Ub
conjugates, but not the growing acceptor chain, are recruited by means
of high-affinity binding to the G2BR domain of gp78.29,37 Although we cannot exclude the possibility that G2BR promotes further
closure of the Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates, we propose that the inherent
dynamics of the Ube2g2∼Ub conjugates coupled with the dependence
of the rate of catalysis on the rate of active site organization enables
gp78 oligomers to effectively be preloaded with the Ube2g2∼Ub
conjugates, which can efficiently elongate the distal end of a growing
polyUb chain in proximity.

If the maintenance of Ube2g2∼Ub
dynamics is functionally
relevant, then the question arises as to what factors prevent stabilization
of a single RING bound catalytic complex. Although there could very
well be Ube2g2-specific factors, an attractive possibility is that
the conformational dynamics of ubiquitin itself may be the governing
factor. Using NMR spectroscopic techniques, it has been shown that
ubiquitin undergoes microsecond time scale fluctuations in the region
surrounding its hydrophobic patch.39 Subsequent
studies have shown that these conformational fluctuations are important
aspects pertaining to ligand recognition and energetics of binding.40−43 Presuming that only a subset of ∼Ub conformations are competent
to bind to Ube2g2 and the binding energies involved are small, one
could expect that Ube2g2∼Ub may remain in a dynamic equilibrium
with the kinetics of closing mediated by the associated conformational
fluctuations of ubiquitin.

Experimental Section
Expression of E1, Ube2g2,
gp78-RING, and Ubiquitin
A codon-optimized insert for the
RING domain of the human gp78 gene
(amino acids 227–298) was synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies
(Coralville, IA) and inserted into a pET28b vector with a His-tag
removable by TEV protease. Ube2g2 was cloned as described in Ju et
al.44 The ubiquitin plasmid was a gift
from Prof. Cecile Pickart. The plasmid for E1, with an N-terminal
His-tag encoded, was a gift from Prof. Cynthia Wolberger. Ubiquitin
mutants were generated by the polymerase chain reaction site-directed
mutagenesis using Invitrogen oligonucleotides and Pfu Turbo (Stratagene)
at annealing temperatures between 45 and 65 °C. Incorporation
of mutations was verified at the JHU sequencing facility.

Plasmids
for gp78-RING, Ube2g2, and E1 were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells, whereas
the ubiquitin plasmids were transformed in BL21 (DE3) cells containing
the PJY2 accessory plasmid. The drug screen used for Ube2g2 and gp78
RING was kanamycin (50 μg/mL), whereas ampicillin (100 μg/mL)
and chloramphenicol (25 μg/mL) screens were used for ubiquitin.
10 mL LB cultures were inoculated with a colony from a given plate
and grown overnight at 37 °C. The small cultures were diluted
into 1 L cultures and grown at 37 °C until they reached an OD600 of 0.6–0.8. Perdeuteration and 15N-labeling
of proteins was achieved by pelleting the cells after reaching the
target OD followed by resuspension in the M9 minimal media containing
deuterium oxide, 1 g/L 15NH4Cl, and 6 g/L unlabeled
glucose. Expression of E1, Ube2g2, and gp78-RING was induced by the
addition of 0.5 mM IPTG and allowed to continue overnight at 18 °C.
Expression of ubiquitin was induced by the addition of 0.4 mM IPTG
followed by incubation at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were pelleted
by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 30 min and stored at −80
°C.

Purification of Ube2g2 and gp78-RING
The cells that
expressed gp78-RING were lysed in Bugbuster Protein Extraction Reagent
(EMD Millipore) with Benzonase nuclease (EMD Millipore), and the lysate
was clarified by centrifugation at 12 000 rpm for 30 min. The
supernatant was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated 5 mL gravity flow nickel
column and washed with 25 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5. The proteins were
eluted in 1 mL fractions with 25 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 containing
200 mM imidazole. Fractions containing the proteins (assayed by SDS
page) were loaded onto a size-exclusion column (Superdex 75, GE Healthcare
Life Sciences) and washed with 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.5
containing 1 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and 0.05% NaN3. Fractions with pure protein were pooled together and incubated
with TEV protease for 2 h at 30 °C. The cleaved protein was dialyzed
against 25 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 before loading onto the nickel
column. The pure protein was collected in a single fraction and dialyzed
against 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 containing 1 mM TCEP
and 0.05% NaN3. The protein was concentrated by centrifugation
at 4000g in a 3k MWCO centrifugal tube (Millipore).
Ube2g2 was purified in a similar method as described in Ju et al.44 E1 was purified as described in Berndsen.45

Purification of Ubiquitin and Ubiquitin Mutants
Cells
were resuspended in 50 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.6 containing 0.02% Triton,
1 tablet Roche protease inhibitors, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 μg/mL
DNaseI, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysis was performed
using a French Press at 1000 PSI with the precipitate removed by centrifugation
at 12 000 rpm for 30 min. A 1% v/v solution of perchloric acid
(70%) was added dropwise to the stirring supernatant. The precipitate
formed upon acid addition was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant
was dialyzed against 50 mM ammonium acetate at pH 4.5, after which
the protein was loaded onto a cation-exchange column pre-equilibrated
with 50 mM ammonium acetate at pH 4.5 and then eluted with a 500 mM
NaCl gradient. The fractions containing ubiquitin were run through
a 30k MWCO centrifugal tube at 4000g to remove high-molecular-weight
impurities. The pure protein was then concentrated and exchanged into
10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.5 with 1 mM TCEP and 0.05% NaN3 using a 3k MWCO centrifugal tube at 4000g. Concentrations for all of the proteins were determined by absorbance
at UV 280 nm in the presence of 6 M guanidinium chloride.

NMR Spectroscopy
of Ube2g2∼Ub* Conjugates
Charging of Ube2g2 with
Donor Ubiquitin for NMR Experiments
To produce Ube2g2∼Ub*
conjugates in the NMR tube, a 200
μM solution of [70%-2H,U-15N]-labeled
Ube2g2 was prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer at pH 8.3 (NMR
buffer) containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 4 mM ATP, 0.05%
NaN3, 10% D2O, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.6 U/mL
creatine phosphokinase, 0.6 U/mL inorganic pyrophosphate, 300 nM C-terminal
hydrolase, and 1.25 mM ubiquitin-K48R (denoted Ub*). Thioester formation
was initiated by the addition of 1 μM E1, with the progress
monitored by [15N,1H]-HSQC NMR spectroscopy.
The thioester formation reaction was typically complete after 15 min.

Assignment of Ube2g2∼Ub* Conjugates
Resonance
assignments for Ube2g2 have been determined previously.44 Assignment of Ube2g2∼Ub* resonances were
confirmed based on three-dimensional (3D) 1HN-15N-13Cα correlation (HNCA) spectroscopy of 500 μM
[70%-2H,U-15N]-labeled Ube2g2∼Ub* in
3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid buffer at pH
7 containing 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM TCEP, 4 mM ATP, 0.05% NaN3, 10% D2O, 10 mM phosphocreatine, 0.6 U/mL creatine
phosphokinase, 0.6 U/mL inorganic pyrophosphate, 300 nM C-terminal
hydrolase, 2.5 mM ubiquitin-K48R, and 2 μM E1. Under these lower
pH conditions, which also require higher E1 and ubiquitin concentrations,
the rate of thioester hydrolysis is slowed, permitting 15 h data acquisition
times.

NMR Data Collection
All of the NMR data were collected
at 20 °C on a Varian Inova 800 MHz spectrometer. The 2D-[15N,1H]-TROSY-HSQC spectra were acquired with 2100
and 328 complex data points and spectral widths of 14 005 and
2593 Hz in the 1H and 15N dimensions, respectively.
The total experimental acquisition time was approximately 2 h for
each dataset. For the 3D HNCA datasets, 840, 32, and 68 complex data
points were acquired with the spectral widths of 14 000, 5430
and 2066 Hz corresponding to 1H, 13C, and 15N dimensions, respectively. The total experimental duration
was approximately 15 h. All of the datasets were Fourier-transformed
using NMRPipe46 and peak positions determined
using Sparky47 software.

Determination
of gp78-RING Binding Affinities
Binding
affinities of gp78-RING for Ube2g2 and Ube2g2∼Ub* were determined
by [15N,1H]-TROSY-HQSC NMR spectroscopy for
200 μM solutions of [70%-2H,U-15N]-labeled
Ube2g2 in the Tris pH 8.3 NMR buffer with 1 mM ubiquitin-K48R (Ub*)
and the specified amount of gp78-RING present. Separate samples were
prepared in parallel for each gp78-RING titration point, with the
Ube2g2 and Ube2g2∼Ub* datasets collected for the same sample
differing only by the addition of E1 to form the Ube2g2∼Ub*
species when appropriate. Composite CSPs were calculated from individual
displacements measured separately in the 1H and 15N dimensions of the TROSY-HSQC spectra as follows 2  and then fit to the following
equation 3  where Kd represents
the dissociation constant and Δδmax the residue-specific
CSP expected when gp78-RING is fully bound. All of the CSP data corresponding
to residues with an observed maximum CSP value >0.15 ppm were included
in a fit to eq 2. Errors
in the fitted parameters were then estimated from the standard deviation
observed from 10 000 replicate fits, which included only 50%
of the eligible residues (duplicates allowed). The fitted maximum
CSP parameters were subsequently utilized for the purposes of estimating
the Ube2g2∼Ub closed state population in the presence of gp78-RING.

Diubiquitin Single-Turnover Kinetics Assays
To quantify
the catalytic activities of Ube2g2 charged with different donor ubiquitin
mutants, a single turnover kinetics assay was designed in which a
fluorescent tag was introduced onto a wild-type acceptor ubiquitin
molecule. A 10-fold stoichiometric excess of precharged Ube2g2∼Ub*-X
(where X denotes a specific mutant) conjugates were then added and
the reaction was followed by fluorescence. This approach enabled the
rate of diubiqutin formation to be quantified independently of the
typically slow thioester loading rate.

Ube2g2∼Ub*-X conjugates
were prepared in 50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 10 mM MgCl2, 40 mM
glucose, 5 mM TCEP, 1 mM ATP, 275 nM Ubiquitin C-Terminal Hydrolase,
250 nM E1, 10 μM Ube2g2, and 20 μM of the specific donor
ubiquitin mutant (Ub*-X). Donor ubiquitin mutants employed were Ub*,
Ub*-L8A, Ub*-I44A, Ub*-I44V, Ub*-V70A, and Ub*-L8AI44A. The charging
reaction was incubated at 20 °C for 5 min and then quenched with
15 U/mL hexokinase (Sigma) for an additional 5 min at 20 °C.
The hexokinase-based quenching scheme, which operates by depleting
ATP, was found to be very effective and benign with respect to Ube2g2
function. The yield for thioester preparation was estimated at >95%
by SDS-PAGE. The wild-type acceptor ubiquitin was labeled with Oregon
Green (OG-Ub) by reacting Oregon Green 488 Maleimide (Thermo Fischer
Scientific) with a ubiquitin mutant bearing a cysteine residue inserted
between the first (methionine) and second residue (glutamine). The
diubiquitin formation reaction was initiated by the addition of an
appropriate amount of gp78-RING followed by the addition of 1 μM
of the acceptor OG-labeled ubiquitin (OG-Ub). Reactions were allowed
to proceed in parallel at 20 °C, 1 atm, with individual reactions
quenched by the addition of reducing SDS-PAGE loading buffer at intervals
of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 min after initiation. Each
quenched reaction time point was then run on an 8% Bis–Tris
SDS-PAGE gel. The OG-Ub was then visualized in situ using a 488 nM
laser on a Typhoon 9410 Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). The
bands were quantified using the ImageQuant program (GE Healthcare).

The fractional progress toward reaction completion, fP, was computed for each time point based on the measured
fluorescence intensities for the Ub and diUb bands according to 4  The initial rates of product formation were
then obtained by fitting to a straight line in the case of mutants
with low activity (i.e., Ub*-L8AI44A, Ub*-L8A, and Ub*-I44A) and in
the other cases to the exponential function 5  where fP,0, fP,max, and v are allowed to
float with the initial velocity, vinit, obtained according to 6  It was
necessary to account for an incomplete
diUb formation (i.e., fP,max ≠
1) due to the competition with thioester hydrolysis. The relative
error in the determined values of vinit was estimated at 11.8% based on the observed variance over 9 replicated
experiments performed for the Ub*-I44A, Ub*-V70A, and Ub* mutants.
This relative error was then propagated into the final reported Michaelis–Menten
parameters using a bootstrap-type analysis with 5000 replicate fits
performed.
