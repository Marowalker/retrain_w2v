Polymersomes
are attractive nanocarriers for hydrophilic and lipophilic
drugs; they are more stable than liposomes, tunable, and relatively
easy to prepare. The copolymer composition and molar mass are critical
features that determine the physicochemical properties of the polymersomes
including the rate of drug release. We used the triblock-copolymer,
poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-block-poly-(dimethysiloxane)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) (PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA),
to form amphipathic polymersomes capable of loading proteins and small
hydrophobic agents. The selected agents were unstable neurotrophins
(nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor), a large
protein CD109, and the fluorescent drug curcumin. We prepared, characterized,
and tested polymersomes loaded with selected agents in 2D and 3D biological
models. Curcumin-loaded and rhodamine-bound PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes were used to visualize them inside cells. N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) agonists and antagonists
were also covalently attached to the surface of polymersomes for targeting
neurons. Labeled and unlabeled polymersomes with or without loaded
agents were characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), UV–vis
fluorescence spectroscopy, and asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation
(AF4). Polymersomes were imaged and tested for biological
activity in human and murine fibroblasts, murine macrophages, primary
murine dorsal root ganglia, and murine hippocampal cultures. Polymersomes
were rapidly internalized and there was a clear intracellular co-localization
of the fluorescent drug (curcumin) with the fluorescent rhodamine-labeled
polymersomes. Polymersomes containing CD109, a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored
protein, promoted cell migration in the model of wound healing. Nerve
growth factor-loaded polymersomes effectively enhanced neurite outgrowth
in dissociated and explanted dorsal root ganglia. Brain-derived neurotrophic
factor increased dendritic spine density in serum-deprived hippocampal
slice cultures. NMDAR agonist- and antagonist-functionalized polymersomes
targeted selectively neurons over glial cells in mixed cultures. Collectively,
the study reveals the successful incorporation into polymersomes of
biologically active trophic factors and small hydrophilic agents that
retain their biological activity in vitro, as demonstrated in selected
central and peripheral tissue models.

==== Body
Introduction
In living cells, many
cellular functions are performed by nanometer-scale
vesicles.1,2 Biological vesicles store substances, such
as neurotransmitters, and control the extent of their release.3−5 There is a current interest to use cellular vesicles, most notably
exosomes,6−8 as carriers to deliver drugs, in view of their compatibility
with cells and organs. Still, in the context of therapeutic carriers,
biological vesicles have few limitations such as complex composition,
limited stability, and modest loading of either lipophilic drugs or
proteins.9 Synthetic vesicles constructed
with amphiphilic block copolymers, or polymersomes, are designed to
overcome these limitations.10,11 They accommodate lipophilic
compounds in their membrane and hydrophilic agents in their aqueous
core.11−15 Like most nanocarriers, polymersomes, were primarily developed as
carriers for anticancer agents.16−20 Stimulus-controlled drug delivery from polymersomes has been demonstrated
as well, using triggers such as changes in pH or in temperature.10,20−24 There is such a diversity in polymer composition, structure, and
functionality, that it is possible to design polymersomes adjusted
to complement the properties of their cargo, from small synthetic
molecules and peptides to large biological compounds such as proteins.25 We opted for self-assembling polymersomes made
of the triblock copolymer, poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-block-poly-(dimethysiloxane)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)
(PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA), as their suitability for protein
protection and transport was reported earlier.26 Moreover, PMOXA, which is known for its nonfouling properties,
provides stealth properties to the polymersomes.27−29

We assessed
polymersomes in biological models in 2D (“wound
in the dish”) and 3D explanted ganglia30 with more complex structures consisting of different cell populations.
Under normal conditions, wound healing occurs through a multistage
pathway that includes coagulation, inflammation, formation of granulation
tissue, and remodeling.31−34 In severe or chronic pathological conditions, the
healing process is locked in a state of chronic inflammation due to
the presence of cytokines, chemokines, and reactive oxygen species
in the milieu, that cause further damage related to oxidative stress.
Therapeutic agents currently used for wound healing include agents
promoting epithelization and antibiotics to eliminate infection at
the site of injury.35,36 In pathologies such as diabetes,
wound healing is impaired because of inadequate trophic support due
to peripheral nerve injury. This repair requires trophic support in
the form of nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (BDNF), and NT3 normally supplied and retrogradely transported
from the target tissues (skin and muscles) to the soma [dorsal root
ganglia (DRG)]. NGF promotes axonal growth in both the peripheral
and central nervous system.37−40 NGF binds to the nerve terminal and is retrogradely
transported to the cell body, where it signals the transcription factor
CREB to upregulate prosurvival genes.40 BDNF is a 27 kDa protein, which when excreted by microglia has been
reported to increase neuronal survival.41−43 NGF and BDNF exhibit
wound healing properties and are excellent candidates for nerve repair.

Other agents have been proposed as therapeutics for wound healing.
Anti-oxidants, such as curcumin (diferuoylmethane), a natural small
hydrophobic and unstable molecule, have been shown in phase 1 clinical
trials to have high safety and wound healing properties.44−47 CD109 is a membrane protein, approximately 180 kDa, which binds
to TGF-β and represses TGF-β signaling in human keratinocytes.48−51 Because curcumin and proteins such as CD109, NGF, and BDNF are unstable
in biological environments,52,53 it is advantageous
to incorporate them into nanocarriers to protect them from hydrolytic
and enzymatic cleavage to reach the site of injury.

We investigated
the safety and effectiveness of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
triblock copolymer in delivering small hydrophobic molecules such
as curcumin and larger hydrophilic proteins such as NGF and BDNF to
promote wound healing and neural regeneration. We characterized the
polymersome structure and drug loading using transmission-electron
microscopy (TEM), asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation, UV spectroscopy,
and dynamic light scattering (DLS), while drug release was monitored
using a dialysis bag method. In addition, drug-loaded polymersomes
were tested in both 2D scratch assays as well as 3D organotypic cultures.
This study demonstrates that PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA is nontoxic
and effective in delivering proteins and small molecules to macrophages,
fibroblasts, and neurons of the DRG and in the hippocampus.

Results
and Discussion
To protect the photolabile curcumin and the
labile proteins (CD109,
NGF, and BDNF) used in this study against harsh environments, we incorporated
them into PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes.54 The triblock PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
copolymer was selected in view of its known chemical stability and
low toxicity.26,55 It was synthesized following
a known procedure,26 shown schematically
in Figure S1. The chemical structure of
the copolymer and the synthetic intermediates was ascertained by 1H NMR (Figure S2) and 19F NMR spectroscopy (Figure S3). The molar
mass of the copolymer (Mn = 9.84 kDa)
was determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy and gel permeation
chromatography (GPC, Mn = 8.8 kDa, Mw/Mn = 1.4). The
chemical structure of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA is shown in Figure 1A, where the subscripts
25 and 75 represent, respectively, the numbers of MOXA and DMS units
in the blocks, as determined from the 1H NMR spectrum of
the copolymer.

(B) Pictorial representation of polymersomes incorporating proteins
(NGF, CD109, or BDNF) or hydrophobic molecules (curcumin) and covalently
labeled with rhodamine and the NMDAR antagonist or agonist [memantine
or R,S-tetrazolylglycine (TZG)].

Curcumin and various proteins
were incorporated into PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes (Figure 1B) using the standard film hydration method. The hydrophobic nature
of curcumin allowed for its incorporation into the polymersome PDMS
membrane with 82.3% encapsulation efficiency (EE, Table 1). The curcumin content of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes was 2.4% (w/w), which corresponds to an equivalent curcumin
concentration of 167.57 μM for a polymersome concentration of
2.5 mg/mL. Higher EE was observed with NGF over bovine serum albumin
(BSA); however, because the mixing ration of protein/triblock was
much higher for BSA compared to NGF, these numbers cannot be compared.
A remarkable EE was achieved with NGF (loading of 4.4 wt %) with an
initial mixing ratio of 4.6% (Table 1). A possible explanation for the high loading of NGF
is its net positive charge at neutral pH (pI of 9.3)56 compared to the net negative charge of BSA (pI of 4.7)57 and its smaller size (27 kDa vs 66.5 kDa). These
results suggest that PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA is particularly
a suitable nanocarrier for trophic factors, such as NGF.

The size
distribution of the polymersomes (60 < diameter <
400 nm), determined by DLS, was relatively wide (Figure S4) with Rh values between
∼65 and 75 nm, depending on the sample (Table 1). Additional analysis of the polymersomes
was performed by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) (Figures 2 and S11) to ascertain the incorporation
of curcumin and NGF and to measure polymersome sizes using the online-DLS
detector. This method is known to be more precise than batch-mode
DLS.58 The morphology of the polymersomes
was assessed before and after loading of NGF by TEM (Figure S12). The electron micrographs show spherical structures
with diameters ranging from 10 to 140 nm. Size distribution after
loading NGF was narrower.

Figure 2 AF4 fractograms of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes.
(A) AF4/UV/DLS fractograms monitored by the UV detector
(left ordinate) and by DLS (right ordinate), using the AF4 method 1, showing the UV absorbance at 280 nm as a function of elution
time for empty PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes (black
curve), curcumin-loaded polymersomes (blue curve), and NGF-loaded
polymersomes (red curve) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10 mM,
pH 7.4); PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA concentration: 0.5 g/L. The
scattered symbols represent the hydrodynamic radii of the eluting
polymersomes. (B) AF4 fractograms from AF4 method
2 of eluting rhodamine-labeled polymersomes with and without NGF.
Both samples were injected at similar PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
concentration (2.0 g/L). The elution of the polymersomes from the
AF4 channel was also monitored by the fluorescence detector,
the fluorescence elution profile matches well with the elution profile
from the UV/vis detector (data not shown). (C) Size distribution of
empty, NGF-loaded, and BDNF-loaded polymersomes plotted as the differential
weight fraction as a function of the hydrodynamic radius (Rh).

The fractograms presented in Figure 2A, which monitor the absorption at 280 nm
of the eluting
species (left-hand ordinate), indicate that curcumin- and NGF-loaded
polymersomes elute at elution times similar to the elution time of
pristine polymersomes. The three eluting polymersomes have similar RH values, as judged from the fractograms in Figure 2A (right-hand ordinate).
The size distributions of pristine polymersome alone and curcumin-loaded
polymersomes are narrow, while polymersomes charged with NGF have
a slightly broader size distribution and a larger RH value. Rhodamine-labeled polymersomes loaded with NGF
were fractionated by a modified elution protocol (method 2) designed
to fractionate free NGF (elution time ∼9 min) and NGF-loaded
polymersomes (elution time ≈ 22 min). As seen in Figure 2B, the NGF loading in the polymersomes
was complete, with no detectable free NGF dissolved in the polymersome
suspension. The rhodamine-labeled polymersomes incorporating NGF were
larger than empty polymersomes by about 25 nm in RH value
(Figure 2BC). We confirmed
that NGF does not interact with the regenerated cellulose membrane
used in the AF4 channel by analyzing NGF solutions of increasing
concentration. The elution signal of NGF measured by the UV detector
was proportional to the amount of NGF injected (Figure S5).

Release of curcumin by the polymersomes
was assessed by a dialysis-based
method. The results presented in Figure S6 indicate that the polymersomes sustain the release of curcumin over
extended time. After a 48 h-incubation in a PBS saline solution (pH
7.4), about 70% of the initial curcumin is retained in the dialysis
tube, hence within polymersomes. Dialysis of free curcumin in the
same conditions leaves less than 4% curcumin in the dialysis bag.
The NGF release from the polymersomes was measured using a dialysis
bag method with a 50 kDa cutoff membrane. In this case, we used a
rhodamine-labeled NGF and measured the time-dependent Rho-NGF content
of the polymersomes remaining in the dialysis bag by spectrofluorometry
using the emission of rhodamine (λex = 552 nm). Nearly
60% of the NGF remained encapsulated after a 24 h-incubation and 35%
NGF was still retained after 48 h (Figure S6C,D). The AF4 elution time of the polymersomes (Figure S7A) increases as a function of dialysis incubation
time, which could be indicative of polymersome swelling for longer
dialysis times. In addition, two new eluting species are observed,
one at early elution times (left arrow, Figure S7A) and one at late elution times (right arrow for times 137
and 235 h). The peak at early elution times corresponds to the triblock
copolymers and free NGF (Figure S5), which
provides evidence of the destabilization of the polymersomes. The
large late eluting band (right arrow) is due to species larger than
the polymersomes (ca. 700–800 nm, Figure S7B) could correspond to large aggregates which would assemble
from the swollen polymersomes.

PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes loaded, or not, with
curcumin and BSA were tested first in cell cultures of macrophages
and human fibroblasts to assess the toxicity of polymer toward these
cells. The cells selected are essential components of the skin, a
target tissue innervated by DRG that we intend to use in the in vitro
polymersomes evaluations in addition to 3D DRG cultures. The first
task was to show that polymersomes are indeed not cytotoxic toward
these cells, which were not evaluated in previous studies of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes.

A concentration-dependent evaluation of pristine
PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
polymersomes confirmed that they do not impair the mitochondrial metabolic
activity and do not reduce the number of viable cells (Figure 3). J774A.1 macrophage cells
were also incubated for 24 h with polymersomes without curcumin (triangle)
or loaded with curcumin (square) and curcumin alone (circle) (Figure 3). There are only
significant reductions in cell viability with relatively large free
curcumin concentrations (>10 μM), suggesting that the polymersomes
could be suitable for the delivery of curcumin.

Figure 3 Polymersomes are well
tolerated by macrophage cells. J774A.1 macrophage
cells were incubated for 24 h with equimolar concentrations of polymersome
nanoparticles (upward triangle), curcumin-loaded polymersomes (square),
and curcumin alone (circle). (A) Mitochondrial metabolic activity
was determined using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl
tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. The data are presented as the mean
± standard error of the mean (SEM) obtained from at least three
independent experiments. (B) Cell viability was determined by cell
counting. Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33258 (10 μM,
10 min) and 9 fields per sample were counted using a fluorescent microscope.
The data are presented as the mean ± SEM obtained from at least
three independent experiments. Statistically significant differences
from the untreated control were tested by Dunnett’s test and
are indicated by *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

Considering that the site of injury is invaded rapidly by
macrophages,
it would be advantageous to exploit the phagocytic and macropinocytic
properties of macrophages for delivery of drugs. This envisioned strategy
promoted us to investigate the rate and extent of polymersomes internalization.
Macrophages were treated with rhodamine-B (RhB)-tagged polymersomes
loaded with curcumin. Taking advantage of intrinsic fluorescence of
curcumin, we detected the location of the polymersomes and their cargo
(curcumin). Confocal fluorescence imaging revealed that polymersomes
are internalized by J774A.1 macrophage cells within 5 min (Figure 4). Co-localization
of RhB with curcumin was confirmed, proving that polymersomes are
capable of delivering their cargo within cells.

Figure 4 Polymersomes are rapidly
internalized by macrophage cells. J774A.1
macrophage cells were imaged using a live cell confocal microscope.
Cell nuclei were labeled with Hoechst 33258 or DRAQ5 (pseudo-color
blue) and treated with polymersomes labeled with RhB (polymersomes-RhB)
(5 μM, based on polymer concentration). Images were acquired
at t = 5 min. Scale bars = 10 μm. Representative
fluorescent micrographs from at least three independent experiments
are shown.

Fibroblast migration is an indicator
of wound healing, and models,
such as the “wound in the dish” model, allow the evaluation
of wound healing therapeutic agents. We used scratch assays to determine
if the biological activity of compounds loaded into polymersomes is
retained or, possibly, enhanced compared to their free form. The experimental
conditions were set to measure the parameters of cell viability and
migration required for a successful wound healing using both mouse
and human fibroblasts (Figure 5). In this assay, an enhanced migration of fibroblasts toward
the scratched surface is considered an indicator of promoted wound
healing. We tested CD109-loaded polymersomes. The following control
treatments were performed: (i) free fibroblast growth factor (FGF,
0.3 μM, a positive control for cell migration), (ii) free mitomycin
C (MitC, 15 μM, an inhibitor of cell migration), and (iii) pristine
polymersomes for 24 h. Representative fluorescent micrographs are
illustrated in Figure 5A with accompanying quantifications in Figure 5B. Treatment with FGF enhanced the fibroblast
migration (1.55 fold), whereas treatment with MitC almost completely
blocked fibroblast migration. Results from this assay show a significant
increase in fibroblast migration, suggesting that FGF and CD109 might
be beneficial in wound healing as noted also in earlier findings.48−51

Figure 5 (A)
Fibroblast cell migration was measured using an in vitro scratch
assay. Monolayer fibroblast cells (human and murine cells) were scratched
with a pipette tip prior to treatment. Control treatments were (i)
FGF (0.291 μM), (ii) MitC (15 μM), and (iii) CD109 (10
μM) for 24 h. Representative fluorescent micrographs showing
fibroblast cell migration after 24 h are shown in (A). The scratch
is denoted by the dashed white vertical lines. Scale bar = 200 μm.
(B) Number of migrating cells to the vicinity of the scratch area

control (set to 1). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM

triplicates. Statistically significant differences from the untreated
control were tested by Dunnett’s test and are indicated by
*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.

Next, we investigated whether polymersome-loaded NGF can
increase
neurite outgrowth in peripheral DRG dissociated and 3D explant cultures.
The restoration of nociceptive fields post skin denervation through
the collateral sprouting by nearby undamaged nerves is dependent on
endogenously produced NGF.59,60 Skin and muscle are
the target tissues innervated by the nerves from the DRG. The experiments
using DRG dissociated and explant 3D cultures described next were
carried out to test if NGF retains its biological activity when incorporated
into PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes (Figure 6A,B).

the significant increase of neurite outgrowth with NGF treatment.
(C) Bright-field photomicrographs of DRG explants after 4 days in
culture. To enhance the contrast of neural cells against the background,
we used MTT (500 μg/mL, 3 h) and imaged with a light microscope
at 10× (Leica DMI6000B). Images were analyzed using ImageJ. Scale
bar = 400 μm. (D) Quantification of the neurite area expressed
as a percentage of control (PBS) (n = 8). The total
neurite area is normalized as shown in Figure S9. Error bars represent SEM. *p < 0.05.

Neurite outgrowth of dissociated
DRG neurons was enhanced significantly
in the presence of NGF, with or without polymersomes as seen in Figure 6A,B. The extent of
neurite outgrowth triggered by free NGF (50 ng/mL) and polymersome-incorporated
NGF was comparable, although the NGF concentration within polymersomes
was several-fold higher. In NGF release kinetics (Figure S6C,D), we observed that the amount of NGF released
in the medium within 24 h corresponds to 40% of the initial content.
Nerves in the target tissues (skin and muscle) are NGF-responsive
in the wound healing processes. Further studies are necessary to assess
if and how polymersome-incorporated trophic factors combined with
small molecules are advantageous in re-establishing normal collateral
sprouting and enhancing the rate of wound closure in animal models.
We tested also NGF-containing polymersomes in a 3D model of the peripheral
nervous system (DRG explants, Figure 6C,D) and noted that these polymersomes significantly
promote the neurite outgrowth. Three-dimensional models both for peripheral
and central nervous system have a number of advantages over dissociated
cultures including retained connections, the ability to monitor long
term time-dependent changes from progenitor to fully differentiated
cells, and more reliable testing of therapeutic interventions.61−63

Both peripheral nerves and central nervous system tissues
respond
to BDNF. BDNF has been established as a crucial trophic factor in
brain development64 and neurological disorders.65−67 Despite the positive neutrophic effects of BDNF, clinical use of
BDNF has been hampered by its instability and rapid clearance; BDNF
has a circulating half-life of ∼10 min.68 We explored polymersome delivery of neurotrophic protein
BDNF in the central nervous system using mouse hippocampal 3D organotypic
slice cultures. BDNF is a crucial regulator of memory formation in
the hippocampus.69 It is known to increase
dendritic spine density70,71 and to facilitate LTP.72 The hippocampus, an area associated with memory
formation, is especially sensitive to traumatic brain injury (TBI).
Even mild TBI, which does not produce systematic vascular injury or
neuronal loss, causes dendritic and synaptic degeneration.73 Repeated mild TBI leads to loss of long-term
potentiation.74

We observed that
polymersome-loaded BDNF has an activity comparable
to that of free BDNF on modulating dendritic spine density in organotypic
hippocampal cultures (Figure 7A,B). While treatment with pristine polymersomes (concentration-matched
control, 211 μg/mL, 72 h) did not significantly affect either
the subtype or the total density of dendritic spine density in serum-free
media, application of free BDNF (100 ng/mL, 72 h) or polymersome-incorporated
BDNF (100 ng/mL BDNF, 211 μg/mL polymersomes, 72 h) significantly
increased the total dendritic spine density compared to both controls:
hippocampi not treated with polymersomes or treated with drug-free
polymersomes in serum-free media.

Figure 7 Polymersome-incorporated BDNF increases
postsynaptic dendritic
spine density of pyramidal neurons in organotypic hippocampal slice
cultures. Cultures were treated with BDNF (100 ng/mL), polymersome-loaded
BDNF (100 ng/mL BDNF; 211 μg/mL polymersome), or empty polymersomes
(211 μg/mL) for 72 h in serum-free media (S−). Serum-containing
media (S+) acted as a positive control. (A) Representative photomicrographs
of dendritic spines. Scale bar = 1.5 μm. (B) Quantification
of spine density and subtype exposed to above conditions. n ≥ 12 spine segments from at least four independent
samples. Statistical significance was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed
by Dunnett’s test. *p < 0.05 compared to
S– Ctrl.

Spine morphology and
density contribute to the synaptic plasticity
and functions. Several NMDA receptor agonists and antagonists have
been evaluated for modulating synaptic functions in different models.75,76 Compounds investigated include TZG and memantine, potent agonist
and antagonist, respectively.77,78 Memantine-coated gold
nanoparticles have been shown to target exclusively extrasynaptic
NMDAR as the large size prevents their entry in the synaptic cleft.
This spatial segregation allows blocking of extrasynaptic NMDAR without
affecting synaptic NMDAR. Savchenko et al. have shown that the gold
nanoparticles exhibit neuroprotective effect by reducing glutamatergic
cytotoxicity.79 We functionalized the surface
of polymersomes with TZG or memantine and imaged them in mixed cortical
cultures. Preliminary results (Figure S13) indicate memantine, and TZG-functionalized rhodamine-labeled polymersomes
are predominantly found in neurons, whereas rhodamine-labeled polymersomes
that do not present memantine or TZG are present in both glial cells
and neurons. Thus, follow-up studies should evaluate electrophysiological
parameters in models of central nervous system pathologies.

In summary, the study presented here demonstrates that PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
self-assembles to form highly colloidally stable polymersomes that
are nontoxic to murine macrophages, human fibroblast cells, and 3D
models (DRG explants and hippocampal organotypic slice cultures).
It suggests that surface-modified PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes
could be useful nanocarriers for various trophic factors, such as
neurotrophin-3, insulin-like growth factor, and in combination with
small biologically active agents or synaptic modulators. Collectively,
PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes merit further investigations
in disease models in vivo to evaluate if they are superior to the
unincorporated agents at the peripheral and central target tissues.
Polymersomes-containing proteins and small lipophilic molecules provide
new avenues for multidrug therapies to be considered for interventions
in neurological disorders.

Triblock Copolymer Synthesis
PMOXA25–PDMS75–PMOXA25 was prepared following a known
procedure (Figure S1).26 Its synthesis is given in Supporting Information, together with its structure and characterization
by NMR spectroscopy and GPC. The PDMS block has 75 units and the PMOXA
blocks have each 25 monomer units.

Polymersome Preparation
and Loading
Polymersomes were
formed by the film hydration method.26,80 PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25 (10 mg) was placed in a round-bottom flask and dissolved
with 2 mL of ethanol for 1 h. The ethanol evaporated under reduced
pressure at a temperature of 40 °C, and the resulting thin polymer
film was dried for 4 h under vacuum at room temperature. Subsequently,
the film was rehydrated using a solution of PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4, 137
mM NaCl, 4 mL, final PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA concentration
of 2.5 mg/mL). The flask was placed on a rotary agitator at room temperature
for agitation overnight and then stirred magnetically for 4 h with
a small Teflon stirring bar. The polymersome suspension was extruded
(11 times) through polycarbonate membranes (0.4 μm pore size
followed by 0.1 μm pore size, Avestin, Ottawa, ON, Canada) to
adjust the polymersomes size and sharpen the size distribution.

Curcumin was loaded during the film formation by adding 0.3 mg of
curcumin to the polymersome solution and sonicated for 30 s prior
to ethanol evaporation. For protein loading, NGF 2.5S (26 kDa), BDNF
(27 kDa), CD109 (180 kDa), or BSA (66.5 kDa) were dissolved in the
PBS aqueous solution used to rehydrate the polymer film. Excess free
protein was removed by filtration through centrifugal filter units
with an MWCO of 100 kDa (Amicon, EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).
Free CD109 was separated from polymersome-encapsulated CD109 using
Sephadex G-200 gel filtration columns (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO,
USA).

Curcumin and Protein Loading Content Determination
For curcumin content determination, an aliquot of the solution after
rehydration was kept and diluted 200 times using a solution of Tween
80 (1%) in PBS. An aliquot of identical volume of the polymersomes
suspension after extrusion and removal of excess free curcumin was
also diluted 200 times in a Tween 80 solution. Both samples were analyzed
by fluorescence spectroscopy (λex = 431 nm, λem = 534 nm). The EE was found by summing the areas under the
emission bands for the two aliquots, and the concentration of encapsulated
curcumin was calculated by multiplying the EE and the initial concentration
of curcumin used. The equations for EE and loading content calculations
are found below    

The amount of protein in the polymersomes
was determined by UV absorbance spectroscopy. The absorption spectrum
of the sample after preparation was compared to that of polymersomes
prepared under identical conditions but without proteins. The protein-loaded
polymersomes were purified by centrifugal filtration through 100 kDa
membranes (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) or G-200 Sephadex columns
for CD109 separation to remove free protein. Fresh PBS was added to
the recovered polymersomes that were subjected to three additional
filtrations. A UV-absorption spectrum of the retentate, diluted to
its initial volume with fresh PBS, was measured. The EE was determined
as the ratio of the absorbance of the suspensions after and before
filtration (λ = 280 nm).

RhB Labeling of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
To detect
the formation of polymersomes and their internalization in cells (in
vitro), the copolymer PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA was labeled by
conjugating RhB isothiocyanate to the −OH end groups. RhB isothiocyanate
in dichloromethane (0.5 μmol) was added to PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
(0.01 mmol) dissolved in dichloromethane (1 mL) and left to react
for 10 h at RT. Excess RhB was removed by dialysis first in ethanol
and then again in deionized water (MWCO 5 kDa) for 48 h followed by
at least three exchanges with water. The RhB-tagged polymer was isolated
by lyophilization.

RhB Labeling of BSA and NGF
BSA
(10 mg), or NGF (0.5
mg), was dissolved in aqueous sodium bicarbonate buffer (0.1 M, 1
mL, pH 8.5). A solution (50 μL) of RhB isothiocyanate in dimethylformamide
(10 mg/mL), briefly sonicated and stirred, was added to a stirred
BSA solution (or 6.3 μL for NGF solution) for 1 h at room temperature.
RhB-labeled proteins were purified from free dye by two consecutive
elutions through Sephadex G25 columns.

Labeling of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
with Drugs
Dicarboxyl acid-modified poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)-block-poly(dimethylsiloxane)-block-poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline)
triblock copolymers (HOOC–PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25–COOH)
were synthesized as follows: succinic anhydride (39 mg, 0.39 mmol),
triethanolamine (50 μL, 0.36 mmol), and DMAP (6.9 mg, 0.06 mmol)
were added to a solution of HO–PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25–OH
(500 mg, 0.07 mmol) in anhydrous dichloromethane at 0 °C under
argon and reacted for 24 h. The reaction mixture was dialyzed against
dichloromethane for 2 days while changing the dichloromethane four
times. NHS-activated ester-modified PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25 block copolymers
(NHS–PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25–NHS) were synthesized
as follows: NHS (30 mg, 0.26 mmol) and DCC (35 mg, 0.17 mmol) were
added to an anhydrous dichloromethane solution of HOOC–PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25–COOH (300 mg, 0.04 mmol) at room temperature under
argon. The mixture was maintained in this condition for 24 h. Finally,
it was dialyzed against dichloromethane for 2 days while changing
dichloromethane four times, followed by dialysis against methanol
to remove dichloromethane. The NHS–PMOXA25-b-PDMS75-b-PMOXA25–NHS block copolymer was characterized by 1H NMR
spectroscopy (solvent: CDCl3; Figure S10).

Polymersomes were prepared with 5% rhodamine-labeled
PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA and 95% unlabeled PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
or 5% rhodamine-labeled PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA, 5% NHS-terminated
PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA, and 90% unlabeled PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA
in the case of drug-attached polymersomes. The triblocks were mixed
in methanol at the molar ratios described above. Methanol was evaporated
using a rotary evaporator. The film was rehydrated at a concentration
of 2.5 mg/mL in HEPES buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) for several hours. The
solution was sonicated for 30 s before being extruded through 0.4
μm polycarbonate filters (Avestin) 11 times, followed by 0.1
μm polycarbonate filters 11 times. A 10-fold excess, with respect
to the calculated amount of −NHS groups on the surface of the
polymersome, of an amine-containing drug over was added to the extruded
polymersomes. The excess unreacted drug was removed by ultracentrifugal
filtration through 3 kDa MWCO filters (Pall Centrifugal Nanosep 3
kDa) spinning the tubes for 20 min at 7000g. The
retentate was rinsed with HEPES buffer, and the centrifugation was
repeated three times. The last retentate was diluted to obtain a polymersomes
(2.5 mg/mL) solution. The polymersome size was determined by AF4/UV/DLS (see below).

Curcumin and NGF Release from Polymersomes
Curcumin
release from polymersomes was measured using the dialysis bag method
in a solution of PBS and Tween 80 (1%, v/v). Tween 80 was added to
solubilize curcumin, which has a low solubility in PBS. A suspension
of curcumin-loaded polymersomes in PBS-Tween 80 (2 mL, CCur = 0.07 mg/mL) was introduced in a dialysis tube (MWCO
= 20 kDa, Slide-A-Lyzer MINI Dialysis, 2 mL) and dialyzed against
PBS-T (44 mL) at 37 °C. At predetermined time intervals, the
entire release medium was replaced by fresh medium to maintain perfect
sink conditions for curcumin. A solution of curcumin (0.1 mg/mL in
PEG400–water–dimethylacetamide (45:40:15 v/v/v) was
used as a control. Curcumin concentration in the release samples was
measured using spectrofluorometry. The concentration of curcumin in
the dialysis compartment was determined as well by taking aliquots
(50 μL) and diluting them 100-fold in ethanol before spectra
analysis.

A solution of PMOXA–PDMS–PMOXA polymersomes
loaded with RhB-labeled NGF (5 mL, polymersome concentration: 0.7
mg/mL) was placed in a dialysis tube (MWCO: 50 kDa) and dialyzed against
PBS (1 L) at 37 °C for several days. Aliquots of the solution
in the dialysis bag were taken over time and analyzed by UV absorbance,
fluorescence, and AF4. The PBS solution was replaced with
fresh PBS at these times.

Asymmetrical Flow Field-Flow Fractionation
Information
about the instrument used and the two methods developed for the analysis
of the polymersomes can be found in the Supporting Information section.

Transmission Electron Microscopy
Data were collected
on an FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin 120 kV TEM. Images were taken with an
AMT XR80C CCD Camera System. Carbon-coated grids were first treated
in a glow-discharge apparatus set at negative 25 mA for 30 s. Rapidly
after, a drop of the polymersome sample (stock concentration at 2.5
mg/mL, 5 μL) was deposited on the grid and left for 1 min. A
Whatman filter paper was used to wick away excess sample by slowly
bringing it into contact with the side of the grid. A uranyl acetate
solution (2%) was used as a negative staining agent, a 5 μL
drop was deposited and left for 1 min before being wicked away with
a clean Whatman filter paper. The grids were placed on a Whatman filter
paper and left to dry in a Petri dish at room temperature until imaging
(>15 min).

Macrophage Cultures and Live Cell Imaging
Mouse macrophage
(J774A.1) cells (ATCC, TIB-67) were cultured in DMEM containing 10%
fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin. Cells were
used between 5 and 25 passages.

In preparation for live cell
imaging, macrophages were seeded at a density of 20 000 cells/coverslip
onto rat tail collagen-coated cover slips (Fisher Scientific). Following
cell treatment, plasma membranes were labeled with 2 μM PKH67
for 15 min and subsequently washed with PBS containing 1% BSA for
5 min. Prior to imaging, cells were washed with PBS containing 1%
BSA for 5 min. Fluorescence micrographs were acquired with a Zeiss
LSM 710 confocal microscope with Zeiss Zen imaging software at 63×
magnification.

MTT Cell Viability Assay
We assessed
mitochondrial
activity, an indirect measure of cell viability using the colorimetric
MTT assay. Macrophage cells were seeded at 100 000 cells/well
in 24-well plates (Sarstedt, Nümbrecht, Germany). Following
treatment, cell media was removed and replaced with serum-free media
containing MTT (0.5 mg/mL), and cells were then incubated for 1 h
at 37 °C. Following the incubation, media were removed, cells
were lysed, and formazan was dissolved with DMSO. The dye absorbance
was measured at 595 nm using a Benchmark microplate reader (Bio-Rad
Life Science Research, Hercules, CA, USA). All measurement points
were done in triplicates in three or more independent experiments.

Human and Mouse Fibroblast Cultures and Scratch Assay
Human
fibroblast cells and mouse 3T3 fibroblast cells were seeded
in DMEM containing 10% of fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin.
Cells were used between 5 and 25 passages.

Both mouse 3T3 fibroblasts
cells and human fibroblasts were seeded at 100 000 cells per
well in 24 well plates, grown to confluency and scratched with a 100
μL pipette and washed with DPBS to remove detached cells. Fresh
serum-containing media was added, and cells were treated with (i)
FGF (0.3 μM); (ii) MitC (15 μM); and (iii) curcumin (24.4
μM) for 24 h. Cells were then washed once with PBS and fixed
with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 15 min at room temperature. Cell nuclei
were labeled with Hoechst 33258 (10 μM, 10 min), and fluorescent
images of the scratch area were acquired. Fluorescent images of cells
were acquired at 20× with a Leica DFC350FX monochrome digital
camera connected to a Leica DMI4000B inverted fluorescence microscope.
Cell migration was quantified using ImageJ and expressed as fold change
in the number of cells in the scratch area over the control.

DRG Cultures
Preparation and Imaging
Dissociated DRG Preparation, Live Imaging,
Neurite Outgrowth
Assay
L1–L5 DRG neurons were cultured from P5–P7
C57BL/6J mice. The ganglia were dissociated in 0.1% trypsin in 1×
HBSS for 45 min at 37 °C followed by gentle mechanical trituration
using a fire-polished pipette. Dissociated cells were grown on laminin-coated
96-well plates (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA) and in growth media
consisting of L-15 (Wisent Bio Products, St. Bruno, QC, Canada) supplemented
with vitamins, cofactors, and penicillin–streptomycin.

In preparation for live cell imaging, dissociated DRG were cultured
in 50 ng/mL free NGF for 24 h. After 24 h, cells were incubated for
24 h with a 50 000 ng/mL suspension of RhB-labeled polymersomes
loaded with NGF or a polymersome-NGF suspension. Fifteen minutes before
the end of treatment, the cell nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342
at 10 μM for 15 min. Cells were washed with PBS and imaged live
using fluorescence microscopy (a Leica DFC345FX monochrome digital
camera connected to a Leica DMI6000B inverted fluorescence microscope).

To quantify neurite outgrowth, dissociated DRG were treated with
vehicle (PBS, control), empty polymersomes, free NGF (50 ng/mL), or
polymersome-loaded NGF (50 ng/mL NGF) for 24 h. After 24 h in culture,
cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature
and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X for 5 min. Neurons were immunocytochemically
labeled with β-tubulin III (1:500, MAB1637) overnight at 4 °C
and AlexaFluor 488 goat anti-mouse (1:500, #A11005) for 1 h at room
temperature. Images were taken with a fluorescence microscope (Leica
DMI6000B). Neurite length was measured manually using the ImageJ extension
NeuronJ.81 The total neurite length in
pixels was normalized to the number of cell bodies and expressed as
percentage control.

Explant DRG Preparation and Explant Imaging
L3–L5
DRG were isolated from P5-7 mice as described above. Explants were
embedded in Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and
surrounded with RPMI-1640 supplemented with penicillin–streptomycin.
Following embedding, explants were treated with vehicle (PBS, control),
empty polymersomes, free NGF (50 ng/mL), or polymersome-loaded NGF
(50 ng/mL NGF).

After 4 days in culture, a MTT solution (500
μg/mL) was added to the cultures and incubated for 3 h. Bright-field
pictures for the DRG were taken at 10× (Leica DMI6000B) and analyzed
using ImageJ. Images were inverted, and neurite outgrowth was quantified
as the total area of bright areas (MTT-labeled regions), excluding
the explant body, normalized against the length of the explant body
in the image, and expressed as percentage control.

Primary
Dissociated Hippocampal Neural Cultures Preparation
and Live Imaging
Primary dissociated hippocampal neural cultures
were prepared from P0–P2 postnatal C57/BL6 mice. Hippocampi
were dissected and placed in ice-cold 1× HBSS. The tissues were
softened in 0.25% trypsin [2.5% Trypsin (Thermo Fisher) diluted 10-fold
into 1× HBSS] for 20 min at 37 °C and 0.1% DNAse I (Sigma
DN25) for 5 min at 37 °C. Tissues were washed twice in plating
media (Neurobasal medium (Thermo Fisher) + 2 mM l-glutamine
(Thermo Fisher) + 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% penicillin–streptomycin)
and mechanically dissociated by triturating with a fire-polished pipette.
Cells were plated onto PDL (Sigma)-coated chamber slides in plating
media for 24 h and switched to serum-free maintenance media (Neurobasal
medium + 2 mM l-glutamine + 2% B27 + 1% penicillin–streptomycin).
Neural cultures were feed every 3 days by changing 50% of the maintenance
media and were used after 12 days in culture. Cells were treated as
described in the corresponding figure and live-imaged using fluorescence
microscopy (Leica DMI6000B). All animal uses followed the McGill University
animal use guidelines and were approved by the McGill Animal Care
Committee.

Organotypic Hippocampal Culture Preparation,
Imaging, and Spine
Classification
Preparation of organotypic hippocampal cultures
were extensively described in Gähwiler et al.82 Cultures were prepared from P6-8 transgenic mice that express
Thy-1 driven eGFP in a subpopulation of CA1 neurons. Hippocampi were
transversely sliced 400 μm thick and mounted onto glass coverslips
using chicken plasma clot (Cocalcol Biologicals; Reamstown, PA, USA).
The culture medium consisted of 25% heat-inactivated horse serum,
25% HBSS, and 50% Basal Medium Eagle. Serum-free medium consisted
of 67% Basal Medium Eagle and 33% HBSS supplemented with 12.5 mM glucose
and 1.25 mM l-glutamine. Cultures were incubated for 3 weeks
in a roller drum incubator before experimentation. Cultures were treated
with vehicle (PBS, control), empty polymersomes, free BDNF (100 ng/mL),
or BDNF-loaded polymersomes. After treatment, cultures were fixed
in 4% PFA overnight at 4 °C, washed with PBS, and mounted onto
microscope slides. Image stacks of CA1 pyramidal neurons expressing
eGFP were taken at Z = 0.2 μm. Images were
acquired using an upright LEICA TCS SP2 confocal microscope (Leica
Microsystems, Heidelberg, Germany) with an HVX PL APO 63× NA
1.4 oil immersion objective. Image processing and spine classification
were performed as previously described.83

Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined
by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s test, independent t-test, or by one sample t-test. Data were
analyzed using SYSTAT 10 (SPSS).
