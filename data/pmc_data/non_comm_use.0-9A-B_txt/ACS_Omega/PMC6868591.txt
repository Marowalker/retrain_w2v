Poly(oxymethylene) dimethyl ethers
(PODMEn, n = 2–6)
are novel oxygenated compounds
that can be used as promising candidates for new-generation fuels
because of their excellent combustion performance. The oxidation of
PODMEn (n = 2–6)
is essential for the understanding of the combustion process. It is
necessary to study the relationship between kinetic parameters and
cetane number (CN) of PODMEn (n = 2–6). In order to predict initiation
step rate constants for the oxidation of PODMEn (n = 2–6), quantum mechanical calculations
are performed using M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) methods.
Structural, energetic, thermodynamics, and kinetics of the automatic
ignition process are assessed. The kinetic model based on the conventional
transition state theory is used to calculate the initiation step reaction
rate constants at 1000 K. In both M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) and B3LYP/6-311G(d,p)
methods, the calculated rate constants of the hydrogen abstraction
process have an excellent correlation with the experimental CN of PODMEn (n = 2–6). Our methodology presented here can be used to simulate
chemical kinetics for other fuel additives.

1 Introduction
Cetane
number (CN) is an important index to evaluate
the ignition performance of diesel, whose value has important influence
on diesel engine cold start, emission performance, and combustion
noise.1−3 The ignition quality of the diesel fuel is closely
related to the chemical composition.4−6 Oxygenated compounds
(molecules which contain oxygen in their structure) can be used as
additives or substitutes to diesel fuels, which could greatly reduce
nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate
pollutants in tail gas and improve the combustion performance of diesel
fuels.6−8 As a new type of diesel additive, poly(oxymethylene)
dimethyl ethers (PODMEn) can significantly
improve the combustion performance of diesel fuels, effectively improve
the thermal efficiency, and greatly reduce NOx and soot emissions.9−12 In particular, the average CN of
PODMEn (CH3O(CH2O)nCH3 with 2 ≤ n ≤ 6) is more than 76, the oxygen content is up
to 47–50%, the boiling point is more than 160 °C, and
all the indices fall within the range of diesel indices.9−12 Furthermore, PODMEn have a good miscibility
with an ordinary diesel fuel and are an environmentally friendly diesel
blend components with great application prospects.11,13 The combustion and emission characteristics of the (diesel + PODME3–4) mixtures with the PODME3–4 volume
blending ratios 10 and 20% have been investigated in a light-duty
direct injection diesel engine.14 The results
show that PODME3–4 can significantly improve the
engine efficiency and reduce soot emissions.14 The effects of (diesel + PODME3–6) mixtures on
the combustion and emission characteristics of a heavy-duty diesel
engine have been studied with the PODME3–6 volume
blending ratios 15 and 25%.15 Compared
with diesel without PODME3–6, the soot emissions
could be reduced by 88 and 95% with the addition of 15 and 25% PODME3–6, respectively.15 Therefore,
PODMEn (n = 2–6)
have potential to be an environmentally friendly additive that significantly
reduces soot formation in diesel engines. The general trend of CN value increasing with the chain length is still valid
for PODMEn (n = 2–6).9−12

To understand the effect of CN improver on
diesel
combustion, it is important to understand the initiation step that
the CN improver creates free radicals qualitatively.16,17 Therefore, a great deal of research has been done on this topic.17−21 In general, for the hydrogen abstraction reactions between organic
compounds
and oxygen, shell opening oxygen induces the formation of reactive
free radicals, followed by branched chain oxidation.17−21 The reactive free radicals produced in the initiation step are generated
by the reaction of fuel (RH) with oxygen.4−6,17,21 The mechanism of hydrogen
abstraction reactions is simple, which can be illustrated clearly
by quantum chemistry theory.20,21 Numerous related computational
studies have been carried out in the literature ranging from the Hartree–Fock
(HF) theory to hybrid density functional theory (DFT), such as the
popular B3LYP, BH&HLYP, M06-2X, and M08-HX methods.4−6,16,22 Kaliaguine et al. had studied the theoretical kinetic on a few simple
compounds, such as n-paraffins (C2–C6), primary linear alcohols
(C2–C5), dimethyl ether, diethylether, and methylal.4−6 The results were consistent with the hypothesis that the rate constants
in the initiation step of the autoignition process of compounds being
studied were correlated with the experimental CN of
these oxygenates.4−6

To our knowledge, theoretical kinetic data
of the autoignition
process of the PODMEn and its correlation
with the corresponding experimental CN data have
not been reported in the literature. Hence, the objective of this
work is to study the theoretical kinetic data of the autoignition
process of PODMEn (n =
2–6) and to study the relationship between quantum calculation
results and the experimental CN of these compounds.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Structures and Energetics
In the
combustion or general oxidation of RH, a bimolecular
gas-phase reaction is considered as the initiation step, given as
follows4,17 1  

In this reaction, an oxygen molecule
reacting by H-abstraction with the initial organic compounds leads
to the formation of the radicals R• and HO2• via a molecular
transition state (TS) [R···H···O2].

The optimal geometric structures of reactants, products,
and TSs
that connect reactants and products are searched. The geometrical
optimizations of PODMEn (n = 2–6) molecules show the distorted helix structure and minimum
energy, similar to the gg-helix of polyoxymethylene.23,24 The geometry optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) level of theory
is very similar to the structure obtained with M06-2X/6-311G(d,p). Figure 1 shows the structure
of PODME5 using the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) method as an illustration.
The Mulliken charges of atoms of PODME5 are shown in Table 1. Although some hydrogen
atoms bonded to the same carbon atom are not rigorously equivalent
to each other, the energy differences between the TSs of the H-abstraction
reactions are <0.2 kcal/mol, which could be ignored. Hence, it
is reasonable to treat them as identical. For example, according to
the positions of hydrogen atoms of PODME5, these hydrogen
atoms can be divided into four groups. For comprehensive study of
the reaction mechanism, all O2-attack possibilities have
been taken into account in Table 2 based on the different hydrogen sites. Table S1 (Supporting Information) presents the total electronic
energies [including zero-point energy (ZPE)] of the various reactants,
TSs, and products at the B3LYP and M06-2X levels of the theory used.

Due to the TSs of the combustion reaction of PODMEn (n = 2–6) molecules show
similar structural
characteristics at the corresponding H-abstraction position, there
is just showing the structure of TSs of the combustion reaction of
PODME5 in Figures 2 and 3 as an illustration. All the
C–H bonds without breaking in the methyl group and methylene
group of PODME5 have a length of ∼1.09 Å. In
the reaction with the hydrogen atom, the breaking C–H bond
is extended by 26–47%. The breaking C–H bond lengths
(Å) decrease in the order R4a (1.602/1.591) > R4b (1.532/1.509)
> R4c (1.449/1.376) ≈ R4d (1.450/1.384) for B3LYP/M06-2X,
while
the forming O–H bond lengths increase in the order R4a (1.053/1.050)
< R4b (1.071/1.076) < R4c (1.098/1.148) ≈ R4d (1.098/1.144)
for B3LYP/M06-2X. B3LYP prediction of the C–H bond is slightly
longer than M06-2X but less than by 7%. In all the TS structures,
the formed O–H bond is shorter than the broken C–H bond,
which indicates that the TS structure is closer to the products than
the reactants, which is consistent with the endothermic properties
of these reactions. Moreover, O2 can form product complexes
with PODME5 via hydrogen bonds between the O atom of O2 and H atom of methylene or methyl hydrogen in PODME5. All TS structures formed are also stabilized by hydrogen bonding,
which is between 2.0 and 2.6 Å in this work. Additionally, with
an increase in the steric hindrance with H-abstraction position moving
to the middle of the molecular chain, the angles of C–H–O
increase in the order R4a (126.5°/121.8°) < R4b (141.7°/130.2°)
< R4c (148.9°/143.8°) ≈ R4d (148.8°/143.7°)
for B3LYP/M06-2X.

Figure 3 Optimized TS structures in PODME5 + O2 at
the M06-2X level of theory. (a) R4a; (b) R4b; (c) R4c; (d) R4d.

The angles of H–O–O are around 109°
for both
B3LYP and M06-2X. These are the features of H-abstraction reactions
from O2. Notably, with the exception of the H-abstraction
from the methyl group and methylene group closed-end position, such
as R2b, R3b, R4b, and R5b, H-abstraction from the methylene groups
contained in the five molecules shows almost the same activation energy
and TS structures.

As shown in Table S1, the reactants
are almost stable as the products by about 14.9–17.6 and 20.8–25.3
kcal/mol at B3LYP and M06-2X levels, respectively. Overall, the difference
between the total energy of the products and their corresponding TS
is smaller at the B3LYP level. In contrast, the total energy of products
is about 0.4–6.4 kcal/mol below their corresponding TS at the
M06-2X level. The activation energies for H-abstraction reactions
of oxygen with PODMEn (n = 2–6), denoted as R1–R5 (a–d), are reported
in Table 3. The relative
energies ΔEI and ΔEII represent the calculated value of activation
barrier between the reactants and the TS at B3LYP and M06-2X levels,
respectively. It is concluded that the B3LYP functional has lower
activation barrier than M06-2X with the same H-abstraction processes.
This may be the B3LYP underestimate the activation barrier on account
of self-interaction
and delocalization errors.25 It can also
be observed from Table 3 that the activation energy of the hydrogen atoms at each end of
the chain is higher than that of the other hydrogen atoms in the molecular
chain. For almost all reaction pathways of PODMEn (n = 2–6), H-abstraction is more likely
to occur on methylene hydrogen than on methyl hydrogen. The Mulliken
population analysis is also used to confirm this observation. The
net charge of an atom in a molecule gives a rough idea of the electrostatic
force between hydrogen and carbon atoms. Table 1 shows the Mulliken population analysis of
atomic net charges of PODME5 using B3LYP and M06-2X methods.
In PODME5, because the electrophilic oxygen atoms decrease
the electron density on carbon atoms, these carbon atoms of the methyl
group and methylene group are negatively charged and positively charged,
respectively. As a result, the C–H bonds of the methyl group
have stronger and more attractive global charge than that of the methylene
group.

2.2 Quantitative Study: Kinetic Modeling and Predicting CNs
The rate constant calculation for the bimolecular
reactions of the autoignition process is implemented within formalism
of the TS theory (TST). All the energy parameters of the reactants
and the TS are shown in Table 3. The rate constant is calculated at 1000 K, which is used
to simulate the temperature in the combustion chamber of the diesel
engine. Consequently, the rate constant for these initiation steps ki,TST is computed using conventional
TST4,6,26 in the following 2  where κ is the transmission coefficient
of the corrected tunneling effect, kB is
the Boltzmann constant, h is the Planck constants, R is the gas constant, and ΔGi,T0 is the standard state Gibbs free energy of
activation at temperature T and pressure P0 = 1 atm. In this work, ΔGi,T0 has been replaced by ΔE in the calculation process of ki,TST. Tunneling effects may be described quantitatively as
the Wigner correction factor26,27 3  where v⧧ (cm–1) is the magnitude of the imaginary frequency
of the TST. However, the tunneling effect has little effect at high
temperature, such as 1000 K. Furthermore, the imaginary frequencies
of all reactions studied here are exactly similar, and the correction
of the tunneling effect has no significant effect on the observed
relative reactivity. Hence, it makes sense to set κ ≈
1. The results of H-abstraction reactions are given in Table 4. It clearly shows that the
order of the rate constants of these reactions (R1–R5) is the
same in both B3LYP and M06-2X methods. Hence, the rate constants of
H-abstraction reactions with PODMEn (n = 2–6) are in accordance with the order PODME2 < PODME3 < PODME4 < PODME5 < PODME6, which is well correlated with the
experimental CN of these pure oxygenated compounds.9−12

a m is the number
of hydrogen atoms with the same chemical environment in PODMEn (n = 2–6).

Results of Table 4 also indicate that the H-abstraction by
O2 from the middle
methylene of PODMEn (n = 2–6) are the dominant paths among all reaction pathways
attributed to its lowest barrier height. The additive group contribution
approach is used to calculate the global rate constant, which includes
the contribution of all H-abstract reactions for PODMEn (n = 2–6).28 The global rate constant of the additive rule is expressed
as 4  where mi is the number
of hydrogen atoms with the same chemical environment
in PODMEn (n = 2–6)
and ki,TST is the individual
rate constant computed for each category of H-abstraction. The computed
total rate constants kglobal and their
logarithmic form log(kglobal) for PODMEn (n = 2–6) combustion
reactions (R1–R5) are reported in Table 5. It is indicated that the kinetic parameters
obtained at the M06-2X/6-311G(d,p) level are far less than those at
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p).

There is
a significant positive linear correlation between the
log(kglobal) calculated at 1000 K for
reactions (R1–R5) and the reported CN values
for the corresponding oxygenated compounds.9−12 The linear regression function
based on the least-squares method is used and expressed at B3LYP and
M06-2X by eqs 5 and 6, respectively 5   6  

In Figure 4, the
calculated results are compared with the experimental CN data for each oxygenated compound in B3LYP and M06-2X methods. It
is clear from Figure 4 that the calculated results are in good agreement with the experimental
results9 for both examined cases. The standard
deviation values in B3LYP and M06-2X methods (, where N is the number
of experimental data) are 0.80 and 0.67, respectively. The average
relative deviation values in B3LYP and M06-2X methods (, where N is the number
of experimental data) are 1.91 and 1.58%, respectively. Both correlations
exhibit a higher CN value with PODME6 than
the reported CN value. It is possible that there
is a negative deviation in the experimental value with PODME6.

3 Conclusions
The oxygenated PODMEn (n = 2–6) are attractive
as clean diesel fuel or fuel additive.
In this work, the theoretical kinetic data of the autoignition process
of the PODMEn in their helix configuration
are calculated using conventional TST with B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) and M06-2X/6-311G(d,p)
methods at 1000 K. Our study shows that the TSs of the combustion
reaction of PODMEn (n = 2–6) molecules show similar structural characteristics
at the corresponding H-abstraction position. The B3LYP functional
has lower activation barrier than M06-2X. For almost all H-abstraction
pathways of PODMEn (n = 2–6), the activation energy decreases as the H-abstraction
position moves toward the middle of the molecular chain. H-abstraction
occurs preferentially on the hydrogen of the methylene closed center
rather than on the closed-end position. Hydrogen bonds are formed
between the O atom of O2 and H atom of methylene or methyl
hydrogen. These hydrogen bonds could stabilize the TS structures.
The linear relationship between the rate constant of the autoignition
process of pure compound and the experimental CN data
is established. Our calculated rate constants are in good agreement
with experimental CN data. It is indicated that the
calculation is reliable, and a relationship between kinetics and CN is established. The methodology presented here can be
used to generate theoretical kinetic data for other fuel additives.

4 Computational Methods
Large varieties of computational
methods indicate that the HF methods
have been known to overestimate barrier heights, and pure DFT methods
tend to underestimate the energy barrier.22,26,29−31 Hybrid DFT methods perform
better for the computation of activation barriers than the pure DFT
because of variation of the exact HF exchange energy term.22,32,33 In particular, B3LYP is one of
the most popular density functionals for a reasonable computational
cost,34,35 and the M06-2X functional has been shown
to predict TS structures with small mean errors.22 In this work, kinetic parameters of H-abstraction reactions
will be determined using the hybrid DFT methods B3LYP and M06-2X.
The present study provides new insights into the autoignition process
of PODMEn (n = 2–6).

All the electronic structure calculations were performed using
the Gaussian 16 software package.36 Calculation
results of the geometrical optimizations and harmonic vibrational
frequency for reactants, TSs, and products were performed with the
hybrid DFT of B3LYP37−39 and M06-2X40 coupled with
the 6-311G(d,p) basis set. All TSs were obtained by using the routine
TS (Berny) method.41,42 On the basis of the TST,4,6,26 the bimolecular rate constants
of all reactions were calculated by using parameters and energy barriers
obtained by the B3LYP and M06-2X methods without being scaled by the
factor anymore. All the TS structures were confirmed by only one imaginary
frequency, and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations were also
carried out to verify that the TS connects the corresponding reactants
and products. The molecular oxygen O2 participated in the
reaction in the form of ground triplet state, and the HO2 radical and R radical were considered as doublet states. The ZPE
and thermal correction values were used for the evaluation of the
reaction activation energies at 1000 K, which represented the operating
temperature of diesel engine during the combustion process.4−6,16 The kinetic model for combustion
reactions of PODMEn (n = 2–6) based on the conventional TST was used to calculate
the rate constants at 1000 K.
