Knowledge of the
chemical speciation of arsenic and selenium in
coal fly ash is essential in the evaluation of the environmental behavior
of fly ash disposed in a landfill in a natural environment. In this
study, a series of high-As coal fly ash from stoker boilers were collected
to determine the chemical forms of arsenic and selenium. The ash surface
chemical characteristics and the speciation of arsenic and selenium
were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray-induced
Auger electron spectroscopy. The results indicate that the surface
enrichment ratio for selenium (63.3–309.5) is higher than that
of arsenic (1.2–21.2). The Wagner chemical-state plot of arsenic
indicates that As is mainly present as As(V) bonded to oxygen ligands,
that is, the [AsO4]3– anion; Se is found
predominantly as elemental Se (62.0–83.3%), followed by selenite
(16.7–38%). The extreme enrichment of both arsenic and selenium
arsenic is controlled by iron oxides in the coal fly ash.

1 Introduction
Metalloid
arsenic and selenium are known volatile elements of environmental
concern, which can be potentially released from coal-fired power plants.1 During high-temperature combustion, volatile
elements arsenic and selenium in coal may be completely vaporized
and significantly condensed onto the fly ash surface.1,2 Coal combustion byproducts (fly ash) are considered to be a main
potential source of trace elements for the environment.3,4 One of the concerns regarding As and Se in coal fly ash is their
natural leaching into the environment when the ash is disposed in
landfills or ash ponds.4 The leaching behavior
of arsenic and selenium in fly ash is largely controlled by their
chemical speciation.4−6 Arsenic in coal fly ash occurs mainly as pentavalent
arsenate [As(V)] with minor trivalent arsenite [As(III)], which might
be associated with glass, iron (oxyhydr) oxides, and calcium arsenate;7−10 these As-bearing chemical species in fly ash are stable under oxic
environment but might be mobile and bioavailable under anoxic conditions.10 Compared to the inert elemental selenium (Se0), the oxidation state of Se such as selenite [SeO32–, Se(IV)] and selenate [SeO42–, Se(VI)] is labile and highly soluble.11 In general, in an oxidizing alkaline environment, selenium is much
more mobile and soluble.6

Coal fly
ash is a complicated heterogeneous material, mainly consisting
of glassy materials with minor mineral phases and unburned carbon.12 The chemical speciation of arsenic and selenium
in the fly ash can be determined by indirect and direct methods. Direct
determination of the chemical speciation of arsenic and selenium in
coal fly ash is an important but difficult task because of their low
concentration and heterogeneity in fly ash. Hower et al.13 used high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) combined with energy-loss spectroscopy to demonstrate that
the nanocarbon particles can host heavy metals and metalloids including
Hg, As, Se, and Pb. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS)
is a primary technique to detect the chemical species of metal(loid)s
in coal or coal fly ash.6,8 However, access to this
energy spectroscopy technique is not easy, and it can be expensive.
In addition to TEM and XAS, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
is the other well-established nondestructive surface analysis technique
for characterizing the surface chemical state of metal(loid)s in the
fly ash.7,14−16 The presence of peak
at 48.5 eV could be assigned to As 3d for arsenic oxides in coal fly
ash.15 Goodarzi7 indicated that As5+ is the dominant form of arsenic in
several Canadian coal fly ashes, and As was found to be greatly enriched
on the surface of fly ash. Yan et al.17 assigned two peaks of Se 3d to elemental Se (56 eV) and SeO2 (60 eV) in the cooled aerosol particles generated from lab-scale
coal/coke combustion experiments. However, XPS may not give accurate
information on the chemical state of one element because the binding
energy values for the specific chemical state of some elements vary
in a relatively wide range. For example, the binding energies of As(V)–O
bonds are 44.9, 45.6, and 46.8 eV for Na2HAsO4·H2O, FeAsO4·2H2O, and
As2O5, respectively.18 More accurate determination of the chemical state of elements can
be obtained by a two-dimensional Wagner chemical-state plot.18−20 The Wagner plot, which combines the data of core-level binding energy
with the kinetic energy of the Auger transition, has been successfully
used to identify the chemical state of elements in heterogeneous natural
samples and to avoid ambiguous results.18,20,21 Therefore, it might be a practical method to clearly
identify As and Se species in coal fly ash.

The chemical speciation
of trace elements in coal fly ash is dependent
upon feed-coal properties, combustion conditions, boiler types, air
pollution control devices, etc.2,7 Much of the detailed
information on the chemical speciation of As and Se in coal fly ash
has focused on pulverized-coal combustors7,8,13 or fluidized-bed boilers.5,7 Coal
stoker boilers are also an important boiler type, which are widely
used in a variety of applications.22 Nevertheless,
direct determination of the surface chemistry and chemical speciation
of metal(loid)s in stoker ash is lacking. In this study, the surface
chemical characteristics and speciation of As and Se in the stoker
ash are studied using XPS and X-ray-induced Auger electron spectroscopy
(XAES). As reported by Mardon et al.,22 the concentration of As in the studied ash samples exceeded 1000
μg/g. On the basis of the bulk analysis, Mardon et al.22 also suggested that arsenic in the stoker ash
might be present as “a condensate on the surface of the Al–Si
ash particles” or as “a component in a fine carbon fraction”.
However, this speculation concerning the chemical speciation of arsenic
in the fly ash lacked direct evidence. The extremely high-As stoker
ash provides a good opportunity to study the chemical speciation of
arsenic and selenium in fly ash. These samples in this study are designed
to obtain more precise information on the chemical speciation of As
and Se in the stoker fly ash using XPS and XAES. To the best of author’s
knowledge, the research may be the first time the XPS–XAES
technique has been used to characterize the chemical speciation of
As and Se in coal fly ash. The results of this study also can provide
not only important information on the modes of As and Se occurrences
in fly ash but also a more practical option for researchers to identify
As and Se species in other complex environmental samples compared
to synchrotron-based analysis.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Sample Collection
Three stoker fly
ashes, 93259 (first row of the hoppers), 93260, and 93261, were collected
in July 2006 from three successive baghouse hoppers of the Eastern
Kentucky University (EKU) heating boilers. The whole ash 93259 was
screened at 60, 100, 200, 325, and 500 mesh, respectively.

2.2 Chemical Analysis
Bulk chemical analysis
reported by Mardon et al.22 was supplemented
with a more detailed examination of the samples used in this study.
In detail, the concentration of major element oxides and trace elements
was determined for the screened ash samples in this study. Especially,
supplementary determination of rare earth elements and selenium in
all ash samples was also carried out in this study (Table S1). Mercury was determined using a Milestone DMA-80
analyzer (with a 0.005 ng detection limit) based on the methods of
Dai et al.23 Concentrations of other trace
elements in the fly ash were determined by quadrupole-based inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Thermo Fisher, X series II ICP-MS).
In order to reduce the spectral interferences of the Ar-based polyatomic
ions 40Ar35Cl and 40Ar38Ar to 75As and 78Se, respectively, the concentrations
of As and Se in samples were determined by ICP-MS using collision/reaction
cell technology, following the procedures outlined by Li et al.24 Boron concentrations were also determined by
ICP-MS after digestion of the solid sample (50 mg) using a mixture
of H3PO4, HNO3, and HF; a 2% ammonia solution
was injected into the spray chamber of the ICP-MS facility to eliminate
the memory effect of boron.25 Prior to
ICP-MS analysis, all samples were digested using a closed vessel microwave
digestion system (Milestone UltraClave).

Analysis of surface
chemistry for the ash samples was performed on an XPS spectrometer
(ESCALAB 250 Xi, Thermo VG Scientific) using a monochromatic Al Kα
(1486.6 eV, 150 W) X-ray source. Survey scan analyses were carried
out with a spot size of 500 μm2 area and a pass energy
of 30 eV. High-resolution scan analyses of the ash samples were performed
to obtain the spectra of C 1s, O 1s, S 2p, Fe 2p, Ca 2p, As 2p, As
3d, and Se 3d. The energy step size for the narrow scan analysis was
0.05 eV. The final high-resolution scan spectrum was obtained with
at least three times of scan for each element. To compensate for the
charging effects, all the spectra have been corrected to the C 1s
spectra set to 284.8 eV.26 Photoelectron
lines after nonlinear background subtraction (Shirley) were fitted
with Gaussian/Lorentzian functions using CasaXPS (version 2.3.13)
software. In addition to the photoelectronic lines of As 3d and Se
3d, the X-ray-induced Auger lines of arsenic (As LMM) and selenium
(Se LMM) were also examined. These data can be used to obtain the
Auger parameter and the chemical-state plot to clearly distinguish
the chemical states of As and Se in the fly ash samples.18,19

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Chemical
Compositions of Fly Ash
Results of bulk analysis of fly ash
are listed in Table 1. The long version of the data
table, which includes all the element concentration results, can be
found in the Supporting Information (Table
S1). In this study, Si, Al, C, and Fe are the dominant elements for
the three raw fly ash samples, which are generally consistent with
the mineralogical compositions of quartz, mullite, and hematite.27 The concentration of arsenic is significantly
higher than the reported values (typically in the range of 1–1000
μg/g) in most other coal fly ashes.5,10,28 Selenium is also enriched in the raw fly
ash (Table 1). Further,
as shown in Figure 1, there is a strong linear relationship between Fe2O3 and As, suggesting that the deposition of arsenic onto the
fly ash surface may be associated with iron oxides.

As and iron oxides (left) in the whole coal
fly ash (bulk analysis) and correlations between the surface concentration
of As/Se and the Fe content by XPS surface analysis.

Figure 2 is a typical
survey spectrum of fly ash (93259 60 mesh). The major chemical compositions
in the fly ash sample determined by XPS are C, O, Si, Al, Fe, P, and
S, corresponding to the binding energies of 285, 532, 104, 74, and
712 eV, respectively (Table 2; Figure 1).
Minor elements (less than 1%, sometimes detected at the noise levels)
specifically Ti, Na, Mg, and Ca are also identified. Main peaks of
As 3d and Se 3d can be clearly observed at ca. 46 and 57 eV, respectively,
in the high-resolution spectra (Figures 3 and 6). Especially,
in comparison with the element contents in the whole coal fly ash
(bulk analysis), the mass percentage of As and Se in most ash surfaces
is larger than 1 wt % (Table 2), suggesting a significant surface enrichment. In addition,
the correlation coefficient values between As versus Fe and Se versus
Fe in the fly ash surface are 0.86 and 0.98, respectively (Figure 2), indicating that
Fe may play an important role in the As and Se surface retention.

3.2 Comparison
between XPS Surface Analysis and
Bulk Analysis
In this study, the element contents in the
fly ash surface determined by XPS are all normalized to Al. The method
has been used in previous studies14,15 because, during
coal combustion, Al was a conservative element, therefore minimizing
the variability in ash compositions and reflecting the differential
enrichment behavior of elements.14 To assess
the surface enrichment of elements in fly ash, the enrichment ratio
(ER) is calculated based on formula 1 1  where MSi and
MBi represent
the mass concentration of each element in the ash surface (XPS analysis)
and in the whole coal fly ash (bulk analysis), respectively. As shown
in Table 2, the ER
value of Si varies in the range of 0.85–1.67, suggesting that
Si generally is evenly distributed throughout the whole ash.14−16 For Fe, the ER value (<1) indicates that Fe is present much more
in the interior than the outer surface.29 However, although the ash surface is not enriched in Fe, Fe is a
still major component on the surface of some of the fly ash particles,
as discussed above. For C, S, P, As, and Se, the ER value is larger
than 1, which is an indication of surface enrichment of these elements
onto the fly ash surface. On the basis of the high ER values for Se
(63–309), it can be inferred that extensive absorption/condensation
of gaseous Se species onto the fly ash surface may occur in the post-combustion
process. Note that although the concentrations of Se (200–321
μg/g) in the whole ash are much lower than that of As (1378–9379
μg/g), Se contents on the ash surface are higher than that of
As (with the exception of the sample 93261) because of the more intense
surface enrichment of Se in fly ash.

3.3 Chemical
State of As
In this study,
all the fly ash samples are subjected to XPS analysis to obtain the
As 3d spectra and four of the samples are determined by both XPS and
XAES techniques. Table 3 summarizes the results of peak position for As 3d, As 2p3/2, As L2M45M45, As L3M45M45 lines, and Auger parameter. It should be noted
that photoelectron lines of S 2s may overlap with As L2M45M45 (Figure 3). To overcome this problem, Auger lines of As L3M45M45 are chosen to obtain the Auger
parameters.21 The selected XPS and XAES
spectra of arsenic in coal fly ash are shown in Figure 3. The high-resolution spectra of As 3d for
all the ash samples, after Shirley-background subtraction, are fitted
with As 3d5/2 and As 3d3/2 doublet with a binding
energy difference of 0.7 eV and an area ratio of 3:2.

In general, the As 3d spectra show minor variations
among all the
samples. The binding energy values of As 3d5/2 are in the
range of 45.7–46.1 eV, suggesting that arsenic might be present
as As(V). The As L3M45M45 lines in
the X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra are found
between 1216 and 1218 eV. Consequently, the modified Auger parameter
α′, defined based on the original Auger parameter (α)
as Wagner suggested,19 can be obtained
based on formula 2 2  where EK and EB represent
the kinetic energy of the sharpest
Auger line and binding energy of the most intense photoelectron line.
The Auger parameter α′ is independent of charging effect
and quite useful to identify the chemical state in insulator samples.18,19,30 As shown in Table 3, arsenic in the fly ash samples
has an Auger parameter of 1263.3 ± 0.2 eV. The calculated Auger
parameter is plotted on the Wagner chemical-state plot as a series
of diagonal lines.

The Wagner chemical-state plot for arsenic
as well as several arsenic-bearing
compounds from NIST XPS database39 and
published data18,21,30 is depicted in Figure 4. In the chemical-state plot, it is observed that all the data points
of the fly ash samples fall on a diagonal line with the Auger parameter
of 1263.5 eV. These points of analyzed fly ash are close to scorodite
(FeAsO4·2H2O) and Na2HAsO4 (points in the blue circle). On the basis of the arsenic
chemical-state plot, other chemical states of arsenic, including As(III)
oxides and AsO2–1, could be ruled out.
This is a little different from the published data about the chemical
forms of As in the coal fly ash. According to synchrotron-based XAS
studies, Huggins et al.8 indicated that
there was a minor fraction (10–15%) of arsenic present as As(III)
in 10 pulverized coal fly ash samples; Deonarine et al.10 reported that 3–8% of total As occur
as As(III) in two fly ash samples. In this study, arsenic in the stoker
fly ash can probably be assigned to oxo-anion arsenate and might be
associated with Fe oxides/hydroxides occurring as Fe(III)–AsO4. As can be seen from Figure 5, Fe 2p in the fly ash photoelectron spectroscopy exhibits
a typical doublet because of spin–orbit coupling interactions.
The peak of Fe 2p3/2, situated at 711.8 eV along with two
satellites at the higher binding energy side of Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, is a typical spectrum of Fe(III) oxides
and hydroxides.20,26 The presence of metal (mainly
Fe) oxides/hydroxides is also supported by the high-resolution scan
spectra of O 1s (Figure 5). The O 1s spectrum displays complex envelopes caused by different
surface oxides species such as sulfates, phosphates, organics, and
metal(loid)s oxides. A shoulder peak appearing at ca. 530 eV in the
spectrum of fly ash 93250 60 mesh is much more obvious (Figure 5) than that in the other ash
samples. The shoulder peak for the 93250 60-mesh fly ash is a consequence
of the high iron oxides content in the ash surface (Table 2). Therefore, on the basis of
the XPS and XAES analysis and the strong correlations between arsenic
and iron (Figure 2),
arsenic in the studied stoker fly ash occurs as As(V) bonded to oxygen
ligands, that is, the [AsO4]3– anion,
and probably absorbed by iron oxides/hydroxides or incorporation into
the Fe-bearing phases. It has been reported that Fe had strong correlations
with As, forming As-/Fe-bearing compounds as independent minerals
or As(V) sorbed to Fe(III) oxides/hydroxides in complex natural samples
(mining wastes, stream sediments, and fly ash).10,20,31 The chemical speciation of arsenic in this
study generally agrees with fly ash samples from the Kingston fossil
plant (Tennessee) that 95–100% of total As in the fly ash occurred
as As(V) associated with iron (hydr)oxides and aluminosilicate glass.32 Tian et al.33 also
demonstrated that arsenic occurred as As(V) in three different coal
fly ash samples using XANES technology. Under a fully oxidized chemical
environment, arsenate bonds strongly to iron oxide minerals as an
inner-sphere complex as a bidentate, binuclear surface complex.34 In addition, the formation of calcium arsenate
in the fly ash could be excluded because of the very low contents
of calcium in the ash surface.2,5,7

3.4 Chemical State of Se
Selenium is
one of the most volatile elements during coal combustion.17 Previous studies reported that Se in coal fly
ash can be present as several chemical forms including elemental Se
(Se0), selenite [SeO32–, Se(IV)],
selenate [SeO42–, Se(VI)], and SeO2.6,8,17 As discussed
in Section 3.2, the
maximum concentration of Se in the surface of fly ash is 309 times
higher than the Se content in the whole ash. Therefore, the Se 3d
signal is strong enough to be detected in spite of the Se concentration
in the whole ash being below the limit of detection of XPS (0.1 wt
%, 1000 μg/g). Detailed XPS patterns of Se 3d for all fly ash
samples are shown in Figure 6. The Auger lines of Se L3M45M45, which are detected at the noise level, are
not considered in this study. It is established that elementary Se,
selenite, selenate, and SeO2 have peaks of Se 3d5/2 at 55.4 ± 0.7, 59.1, 59.4 ± 0.6, and 61.6 eV, respectively.39

Figure 6 Se 3d high-resolution spectra for all the fly ash samples
detected
by XPS. Black solid lines and dashed–dotted lines refer to
best-fit and experimental curves, respectively. The peak assignment
obtained by deconvolution is shown as dashed lines in different colors.
The Shirley background is added to each Se 3d spectrum. fwhm remains
consistent during the fitting process (2.3–2.5 eV).

As described in Figure 6, the Se 3d peak for fly ash samples has
a main asymmetric
peak at 57 ± 0.7 eV with a broad binding energy range extending
from 62 to 54 eV, indicating that more than one chemical state of
Se occurred in the fly ash.37 The Shirley-subtracted
high-resolution spectra of Se 3d are fitted with the Se 3d5/2–3d3/2 separation of 0.86 eV and full width at
half-maximum (fwhm) of 2.3–2.5 eV. Two chemical states of Se
could be observed in the Se 3d spectra (Table 4). The first split doublet is assigned to
elemental Se0 with a binding energy of Se 3d5/2 at 56.5 ± 0.2 eV; the second peak corresponds to selenite (SeO32–, Se(IV)) with a binding energy of 58.5
± 0.4 eV. All the fitting results are listed in Table 4. The Se distribution in the
fly ash samples is dominated by elemental Se (62.0–83.3%),
followed by selenite (16.7–38%). Se(VI) selenate or SeO2 is not the major form because the oxidation state of hexavalent
Se 3d5/2 corresponds to a higher binding energy than that
of Se(IV). Therefore, the residual error for the fitting process is
lowest when the Se 3d peak is fitted into elemental Se0 and selenite. The result is generally in agreement with Liu et al.6 that elemental Se is the dominant form with minor
Se oxy-anions. In an earlier HRTEM study of the fly ash samples (93261
whole fly ash), Silva et al.27 observed
that Se mainly occurred in the elemental form encapsulated by the
carbonaceous matter. However, studies of other fly ash sources indicated
that Se(IV) was the predominant phase.8,9,32,33 The variations between
the chemical forms of Se in different fly ash samples might be associated
with the different boiler types (stoker boiler vs pulverized-coal
combustor), ash components, and the air pollution control devices.

3.5 Possible Enrichment Mechanisms
for High-As/Se
Fly Ash
The feed coal used in the EKU steam plant is low-S
(0.8%), high volatile A bituminous coal; trace elements, such as As
(133 μg/g), are enriched in the feed coal, whereas Se (1.25
μg/g) is not concentrated.22 The
extremely high concentration of arsenic and the great surface enrichment
of Se in the fabric filter fly ash may, therefore, not be anticipated.
However, as noted above, the chemical composition of fly ash is not
solely determined by the feed coal chemistry. Combustion conditions,
post-combustion process, and the air pollution control devices are
also important factors affecting the element’s partitioning
behavior.1 It is known that the concentration
of As and Se is closely associated with particle size distribution;
both As and Se are found to be concentrated on the fine-grain ash
particles.2,5,35 As shown in Figure S1, examination of the sized ash showed
an enrichment of Fe in the coarser fly ash particles. This can also
be observed based on the variations of Fe content in the raw fly samples
from different baghouse hoppers. From the first-row fly ash to the
third-row fly ash, the contents of Fe decreased along with the decreasing
ash particle sizes (Table 1). Therefore, most of the Fe oxides are probably present as
individual coarse particles, as indicated by the mesh sizes of the
fly ash. Interestingly, the variations of arsenic also display an
enrichment in the coarse fly ash particles (Figure S1). Further, the surface analysis by XPS reveals that both
arsenic and selenium peak in the coarsest fly ash fractions (93259
60-mesh ash). This is not anticipated as many previous studies reported
the preferential condensation or absorption of volatile species onto
the smaller particles during the post-combustion process.2,5,36 Obviously, combined with the
data from XPS and XAES experiments, the large amounts of Fe oxides
play an important role in the significant retention of As and Se in
the stoker fly ash surface.

The partitioning of arsenic and
selenium between the vapor and solids is largely associated with the
interactions of gaseous species with ash particles in the post-combustion
zone. During high-temperature coal combustion in the stoker boiler,
arsenic and selenium in feed coal would mostly vaporize into gas phases,
such as Se0 (g), SeO (g), SeO2 (g), As2O3 (g), AsCl3 (g), and As2O5 (g).17 These metalloid vapor phases
may be physically and/or chemically absorbed by the iron oxides. Seams
and Wendt37 found that a strong correlation
relationship existed between the concentration of As/Se and Fe/Ca
content in the size-segregated ash particles collected from a 17 kW
laboratory combustor. They suggested that Fe and/or Ca provided active
sites for surface reactions where Se reacted preferentially with Fe
over Ca. Compared to other mineral components (CaO and Al2O3), Fe(III) oxides were found to have the best absorption
capability to react with gaseous As2O3 (g),
forming stable arsenates.38 In this study,
the distribution of Fe oxides among the sized-fraction fly ash samples
reveals that most of the iron oxides having relatively larger particle
sizes are collected in the first-row baghouse hoppers (Table 1). Consequently, arsenic and
selenium that are captured by iron phases have their highest concentrations
in the coarsest fly ash surface.

4 Conclusions
The surface chemical characteristics of As-enriched coal fly ash
samples were studied by XPS and XAES, especially focusing on the chemical
forms of arsenic and selenium in fly ash. Although the concentration
of Se (200–321 μg/g) is significantly lower than that
of As (1378–9379 μg/g), Se is found to be more enriched
in the fly ash surface with surface ERs being up to 309. Arsenic in
the fly ash samples has a binding energy and a kinetic energy in the
range of 45.7–46.1 and 1216–1218 eV, respectively. Consequently,
the Auger parameter for arsenic is calculated as 1263.3 ± 0.2
eV. The Wagner chemical-state plot derived from the As 3d binding
energy and As L3M45M45 kinetic energy
can be effectively used to determine the chemical state of arsenic
in fly ash. These results reveal that As is mainly present as As(V)
bonded to oxygen ligands, that is, the [AsO4]3– anion in the coal fly ash. The Se 3d peak has the main asymmetric
peak at 57 ± 0.7 eV with a broad binding energy range and two
chemical forms of Se can be found: elemental Se (62.0–83.3%)
with a binding energy of Se 3d5/2 at 56.5 ± 0.2 eV
and selenite (16.7–38%) with a binding energy of 58.5 ±
0.4 eV. On the basis of the XPS data and strong correlations between
the concentration of As and Se and the iron content, the extreme enrichment
of both arsenic and selenium is probably controlled by iron oxides
in the coal fly ash.
