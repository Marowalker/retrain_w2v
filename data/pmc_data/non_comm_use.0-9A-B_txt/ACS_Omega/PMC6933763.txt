There is an urgent need for electrochemical sensor materials
that
exhibit electrochemically compliant properties while also retaining
high durability under physiological conditions. Herein, we demonstrate
a novel strip-style electrochemical sensor using reduced graphene
oxide (rGO) and poly(ethylene dioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonic
acid) (PEDOT/PSS) nanocomposite films. The fabricated rGO–PEDOT/PSS
sensor with and without nafion has shown an effective electrochemical
response for both selectivity and sensitivity of the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine,
5-HT) neurotransmitter. The developed high-performance hybrid graphene/conducting
polymer strip sensors are likely to find applications as chip electrochemical
sensor devices for patients diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a long-term
mental illness affecting
the brain system and thus the memory and awareness of senior people.
It can be clinically diagnosed by an extreme loss of serotonergic
neurons when a severe drop in the level of the 5-HT neurotransmitter
happens.1 Serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine)
is a double-functioning biomolecule present inside and outside the
brain tissues acting as a neurotransmitter and a hormone, respectively.2,3 Once the 5-HT level is depleted (or raised), irregular biological
and physiological disorders can occur among individuals. In addition,
AD could lead to addiction to alcohol, infantile autism, sleep disturbances,
depression, liver abnormality, and difficulty to adapt when 5-HT is
dysfunctional.4,5 Therefore, early and direct detection
of 5-HT is a pivotal subject for medical diagnostic clinics and biological
researchers nowadays.6,7

Traditional determination
methods, for example, high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) and spectrophotometry, have been used
for biosensing of 5-HT; however, they are not cost-effective and require
prolonged procedures for sample preparation. Interestingly, due to
the electroactive nature of 5-HT, electrochemical techniques (low
cost, affordable for lab application, and highly selective and sensitive
for biomolecules) have been introduced as suitable determination methods
for fast detection of this neurotransmitter.

Numerous materials
are used to obtain satisfactory performance
of electrochemical electrodes; however, 5-HT detection is still a
challenge using unmodified sensors. 5-HT coexists with numerous species
in biological samples; dopamine (DA) is one of them. 5-HT and DA are
electroactive and have been found to have very close oxidation potentials
when tested by bare electrodes, in turn resulting in signal overlapping
of both chemicals.8 Therefore, most of
the reported sensors lack good selectivity and high sensitivity when
simultaneously detecting these species. Another issue is that most
of the traditional electrochemical sensors are fabricated in large
sizes, which are not ideal for implantation purposes because they
cause large tissue damage.8,9 Furthermore, detection
of 5-HT has not been widely reported so far.8,10 However,
it is suggested that, for optimum detection of 5-HT, many aspects
of the prepared sensor should be considered such as material chemistry,
electrode design, electrochemical properties, ability to be activated,
and surface properties.

The promising electrochemical performance
of graphene (G) has created
a new platform that is used for a number of applications including
biosensing technology.11,12 Graphene has been suggested as
an excellent candidate for sensor devices because it has fascinating
electrical, thermal, and electrochemical properties. Biocompatibility,
great conductivity, high electron mobility, ability to be modified,
and high surface-to-volume ratio all highlight the versatility of
graphene and its composite-based electrodes.13,14 Hence, graphene is currently applied in multiple electrochemical
experiments and has led to significant achievements.13,15 Therefore, scientific researchers have focused on applying this
unique material for biodetection of 5-HT in pristine and/or composite
structures as well as as a modifier for conventional electrodes.2,16 However, the actual capability of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) for
use as an electrochemical sensor can reduce as a result of accumulation
that develops among the graphene tiers. This phenomenon is attributed
to electrostatic and π–π interactions between carbon
molecules within the layers. Therefore, scientists have directed their
attention to overcome the accumulation drawback and use rGO effectively
and efficiently.

Coating graphene electrodes with conductive
polymers (CPs) has
been introduced as a perfect solution for eliminating accumulation
and increasing the electrocatalytic properties of the electrode at
the same time. In a typical chemical reaction at the electrode’s
surface, conductive polymers work as a connector to facilitate the
movement of electrons from various oxidized analytes to the electrode.
Many studies are being carried out on conductive polymers in the field
of electrochemistry, particularly, neurotransmitter sensing.

Therefore, such polymers having superelectronic and electrocatalytic
properties have been in demand in the construction of electrochemical
sensors, for example, graphene-based electrodes modified with poly(ethylene
dioxythiophene)/poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT/PSS) because of
fascinating conductivity, the flexibility of electron transfer with
reasonable oxidation potentials, and water solubility to obtain the
interactive effect of all components when performing toward aimed
analytes.17,18 Also, PEDOT/PSS is a very promising conductive
polymer to decrease the restacking problem of graphene layers. The
polymeric backbone of PEDOT can also be easily functionalized to increase
its conductivity, biocompatibility, and stability through the incorporation
of various dopants, counter ions, and biological moieties. The most
frequently used PEDOT derivative is PEDOT doped with poly(styrene-sulfonate)
(PSS), PEDOT:PSS, with an electrical conductivity that can go as high
as 4600 S cm–1.19,20

Nafion
as a perfluorinated ion-exchange and negatively charged
polymer is also extensively used due to its good biocompatibility
and excellent selectivity to cations rather than anions.21 Modification of electrochemical electrodes with
nafion has shown improved selective adsorption. This approach is quite
useful to increase absorption of 5-HT cations and for recording better
measurements.

In this paper, we demonstrate the fabrication
of an rGO–PEDOT/PSS
sensor in strip style for qualified voltammetric determination of
the 5-HT neurotransmitter. The applied electrochemical techniques
displayed sensitivity and selectivity toward 5-HT compared to co-existed
DA molecules. In addition, the sensor’s performance has been
enhanced by adding nafion in rGO–PEDOT/PSS dispersion and the
effect of nafion on selective detection of 5-HT when simultaneously
tested with DA (the interference) has been investigated. The physical
and chemical characterization of the developed electrochemical sensors
has been carried out.

Results and Discussion
Physical Characterization of rGO–PEDOT/PSS Strip
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-prepared rGO–PEDOT/PSS
film are shown in Figure 1a. As can be seen from Figure 1a, as-prepared films show a smooth and flat surface,
which suggests the tight interaction between PEDOT/PSS and graphene
sheets in addition to the role of PEDOT/PSS in decreasing the restacking
problem within graphene layers. The obtained SEM image at higher resolution
in Figure 1a (inset)
showed minor curves on the rGO–PEDOT/PSS film due to minimal
restacking of rGO. The results show that obvious changes occurred
in rGO–PEDOT/PSS films once mixed with the nafion polymer.
The SEM image in Figure 1b revealed the wrinkled surface of the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
composite film, which could be attributed to the solvent evaporation
process. The rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion film showed random
dark spots distributed on its surface in Figure 1b (inset: magnified image). These dark spots
were not seen on the rGO–PEDOT/PSS film with no nafion (Figure 1a magnified image).
It could be due to distortion in the polymer structure when mixed
with graphene that causes polymer rearrangement.

and rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion. (d) Fourier transform infrared

and nafion-modified rGO–PEDOT/PSS strips. (f) DPV of separate
detection of DA (10 μM) using unmodified and nafion-modified
rGO–PEDOT/PSS strips.

Figure 1c represents
the Raman spectra of nafion, PEDOT/PSS, rGO, rGO–PEDOT/PSS,
and rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion samples. D and G bands are
two predominant bands highlighted in Raman spectra.22,23 The D band is related to any disorders in the structure of the film’s
components caused by defects, functional groups, and surface faults.
The G band is generated from heterogeneous structures and carbon bond
vibrations within the graphitic layer.24,25 As shown in Figure 1c, sharp and clear
D and G peaks appear at 1340 and 1580 cm–1, respectively,
in Raman spectra of rGO, rGO–PEDOT/PSS, and rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
samples. PEDOT/PSS showed relatively weak peaks at 1530, 1430, 1260,
1000, and 580 cm–1, which could not be seen in rGO–PEDOT/PSS
or rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion due to low intensity.26 The increased ID/IG ratio recorded for composite
films from 1.15 (the rGO–PEDOT/PSS) to 1.27 (rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion)
suggests the role of nafion in generating a high proportion of defects
and fractions on the rGO–PEDOT/PSS film surface.27,28 The rGO sample displayed an even higher ID/IG ratio of 1.43 than
rGO–PEDOT/PSS and rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion and revealed
highly defective surface resulting from the reduction process of GO
to rGO.

FTIR spectroscopy is a complementary technique to Raman
analyses
for sample surfaces to monitor any changes when modified (Figure 2d). PEDOT/PSS vibrations
at 1580 and 1508 cm–1 belong to the thiophene ring.29,30 S–O and S–phenyl groups were also detected at 1166,
1125, and 1028 cm–1.29,30 However, PEDOT/PSS
peaks decreased after mixing with rGO to prepare an rGO–PEDOT/PSS
composite film.29,31 Notably, the peaks increased
significantly after the addition of nafion to prepare an rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
composite. Nafion role in creating oxygen functional groups on electrodes
surface showing more curvature structure.

Figure 2 DPV results of the as-prepared
strip films (rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5 wt %)) with different compositions (thicknesses): (a) 100 μL
of the composite, (b) 200 μL of the composite, (c) 300 μL
of the composite, and (d) 400 μL of the composite. The area
of a single film was 2 cm2. The testing system includes
a constant level of DA (5 μM) with (0.1–10 μM)
5-HT.

The sensing ability of rGO electrodes toward 5-HT
concentrations
was also investigated using DPV as highly sensitive and precise electrochemical
technology. Figure 1e shows DPV curves of rGO–PEDOT/PSS with and without nafion
strip films in a phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) solution containing
10 μM 5-HT. Using the rGO–PEDOT/PSS strip (red line),
inadequate current signal response was recorded, at less than 0.5
μA. However, the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (5 wt %)
strip (orange line) gave a well-distinguished oxidation signal of
5-HT at around 20 μA current signal. In a comparison between
concentric nafion (5%) and diluted nafion (0.5%) mixed with rGO–PEDOT/PSS,
a vast improvement in the 5-HT current signal was noticed in the diluted
nafion–rGO–PEDO/PSS strip (purple line, Figure 1e). For 10 μM 5-HT, the
diluted nafion electrode recorded an outstanding oxidation signal
current response at around 40 μA, which is double of that shown
at the concentric nafion-modified electrode.

Similarly, Figure 1f shows DPV curves
of rGO–PEDOT/PSS with and without nafion
strips in a PBS solution containing 10 μM DA. The current response
of the DA oxidation signal increased and became more prominent after
rGO–PEDOT/PSS modification with concentric nafion (orange curve).
Furthermore, the diluted nafion (0.5%)-modified rGO–PEDOT/PSS
electrode showed significant current response of DA (50 μA),
which is two times higher than that recorded by the concentric nafion-modified
electrode (which was around 25 μA only). The presence of diluted
nafion enhances the current intensity dramatically about 100 times
and 2 times compared to untreated rGO–PEDOT/PSS or concentric
nafion-modified rGO–PEDOT/PSS strips, respectively. This can
be explained by the remarkable selective adsorption of nafion, especially
when it has lower thickness, which probably controls the transferring
process of ions in the solution to the surface of the electrode.32

Hence, the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5%) film has been
selected to investigate the targeted biomolecule 5-HT based on the
already proven electrochemical performance in Figure 1e,f. However, the drop-casted amount of film
dispersion needs to be further investigated as well due to the direct
effect on the strip performance subsequently. Therefore, DPV experiments
were carried out using rGO–PEDOT/PSS and diluted nafion for
prepared films at different thicknesses. In particular, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, and 0.4 mL of the (diluted nafion–rGO–PEDOT/PSS)
composite were separately drop-casted on the same dimensional gold
mylar substrates (area = 2 cm2). The recorded thickness
of each film was varied and corresponded to the amount of deposited
composite (as in Figure 2). The testing system included a PBS solution containing 5 μM
DA with consecutive additions of 5-HT (0.1–10 μM).

As-prepared films with 100 μL of the composite and low concentrations
of 5-HT were less defined at 0.36 V (showing a minor oxidation signal
as shown in Figure 2a). Moreover, higher concentrations of 5-HT revealed a clear oxidation
signal with excellent sensitivity. Besides, current response of a
DA oxidation signal descended and did not appear after a few additions
of 5-HT.

On the other hand, for the as-prepared film with 200
μL of
the composite, highly separated signals belonging to 5-HT, at 0.4
V, and DA, at 0.16 V, were noticed with high sensitivity (Figure 2b). Although DA was
found at a high level, these results confirmed the enhanced sensitivity
of 5-HT, about 2.5 times that of the first film. Furthermore, the
oxidation signal of 5-HT slightly shifted to a positive potential,
which indicated increased electrocatalytic activity of this film.
A dramatic decrease in DA response was observed in the same DPV shown
in Figure 1b.

Moreover, the as-prepared film with 300 μL of the composite
demonstrated extremely low current response of 5-HT and DA oxidation
signals in Figure 2c. The reason is that the extra amount of diluted nafion in the composite
possibly obstructed some active sites on the strip surface, which
indicates low permeability and weakened catalytic activity. Likewise,
DPV findings in Figure 2d for the as-prepared film with 400 μL of the composite were
complementary to DPV outcomes in Figure 2c. Figure 2c,d explains the claimed concept of the thickness effect
on the voltammetric performance of the electrodes.

It can be
concluded that the thickness of deposited rGO–PEDOT/PSS
with a diluted nafion composite film plays an important role in obtaining
improved selective adsorption of serotonin. Therefore, according to
the obtained results for developed strip films in Figure 2, the strip film with 200 μL
of the composite can be considered as the best-performing film among
others due to improved sensitivity and selectivity toward 5-HT in
the presence of DA interference. The separated oxidation signals of
5-HT and DA facilitated the study of the oxidation process of 5-HT
and demonstrated the optimum amount of nafion–rGO–PEDOT/PSS
composite used for electrode fabrication in Figure 2b. The capability of the diluted nafion–rGO–PEDOT/PSS
strip in detecting 5-HT and DA simultaneously has been investigated.
PBS solution containing 5 μM DA with a range of 5-HT concentrations
(0.1–10 μM) was used for DPV. Figure 2a exhibits the oxidation signal of 5-HT,
which was very stable at 0.4 V with no shifts. Moreover, a well-defined
and gradually increasing current response was observed for the sequential
additions of 5-HT. It is worth mentioning that DA, which was present
at a high and constant level, did not interrupt the oxidation signal
of 5-HT. Furthermore, DA showed a clear oxidation signal at 0.16 V
with a decent current response. However, the DA signal rapidly depleted
and disappeared after a few consecutive additions of 5-HT. This result
showed that both 5-HT and DA have competitive adsorption at the electrodes
surface when simultaneously tested.

Electrochemical Performance of the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
Strip
Separate Detection of 5-HT and DA
A modified rGO–PEDOT/PSS
electrode with the diluted nafion (0.5%) strip film has been proven
to be promising for highly sensitive and selective adsorption of 5-HT
or DA. The obtained results of DPV are shown in Figure 3a,b for the individual targeted oxidation
of 5-HT and DA from 1 to 10 μM, respectively. DPV curves showed
increased current responses with increasing 5-HT concentration at
0.4 V in Figure 3a
using an rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%) strip sensor. The
5-HT signal was notable even at a low concentration of 1 μM.
In addition, a high DA oxidation signal was observed at 0.16 V when
the above strip sensor was used as shown in Figure 3b. The oxidation signal of DA gradually increased
with an increase in its concentration. Moreover, 1 μM 5-HT elucidated
satisfactory current intensity higher than that recorded for 1 μM
DA. With continued additions of 5-HT and DA, 5-HT showed a slightly
lower current response due to secondary products such as 5-HIAA from
the oxidation process of 5-HT.

and 200 mV/s, (e) DPV of simultaneous detection of 5-HT and DA when
DA was constant (5 μM) and 5-HT was changed (0.1–10 μM),
(f) DPV of simultaneous detection of 5-HT and DA when 5-HT was constant
(5 μM) and DA was changed (0.1–10 μM).

Simultaneous Detection of 5-HT and DA
An rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5%) strip film was used for simultaneous detection of 5-HT and
DA in a PBS solution. The determination of 5-HT and DA was accomplished
inside a cabinet to minimize the effect of the environment on running
experiments. The solutions were daily and freshly prepared in the
laboratory using precise scales and an isolated hood for nanoscale
powders. The applied experimental protocol for measuring 5-HT did
not interrupt by the later addition of DA.

The electrochemical
performance of an rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%) strip
was decently evaluated toward simultaneous detection of 5-HT and DA
(at 10 μM of each them) through a CV experiment. At 20 mV/s
scan rate, 5-HT and DA showed well-separated and sharp oxidation signals
at 0.4 and 0.16 V (vs Ag/AgCl), respectively (Figure 2c). Increasing the scan rate from 20 to 200
mV/s for the same system as shown in Figure 3d, a symmetrical CV shape was observed with
a proportional and an identical redox couple of 5-HT and DA. Figure 3c,d shows the enhanced
sensitivity recorded by the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%)
strip film toward 5-HT in the presence of DA. As can be seen from Figure 3c,d, the oxidation
mechanism of 5-HT and DA is a diffusion-controlled process.

The capability of an rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%)
strip in detecting 5-HT and DA simultaneously has been demonstrated
using the DPV method. Figure 3e exhibits DPV of 5-HT from 0.1 to 10 μM in a PBS solution
containing DA (5 μM). The oxidation signal of 5-HT was very
stable at 0.4 V, and no shifts were observed. The current response
was well defined and typically increased with the sequential additions
of 5-HT without interruption of DA that already existed at a high
and constant level.24 Furthermore, DA showed
a clear oxidation signal at 0.16 V with a decent current response.
However, the DA signal rapidly depleted and disappeared after a few
consecutive additions of 5-HT.33Figure 3e shows that both
5-HT and DA have competitive diffusion at the surface of the film
when simultaneously tested.

A constant level of 5-HT (5 μM)
with a range of DA from 0.1
to 10 μM was also investigated using an rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5%) strip film, as shown in Figure 3f. The first injections of DA from 0.1 to 0.8 μM
were not detectable. However, the current response of greater DA concentrations
from 1 to 10 μM was recorded at 0.16 V (vs Ag/AgCl). After each
DA addition, a linearly increased signal appeared corresponding to
the DA oxidation process. The sharp and clear signal noticed at 0.4
V could be attributed to oxidized 5-HT. The current response of the
5-HT signal slightly minimized concurrent with the continuous additions
of DA evaluated through DPV. 5-HT and DA showed interesting competitive
adsorption when simultaneously tested. It can also be observed that
the 5-HT signal was still well recognized in Figure 3f unlike the DA signal, which faded in Figure 3e. These results
proved that the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%) strip film
has a high priority to 5-HT detection compared to DA. In other words,
the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%) strip film revealed
much more catalytic activity to 5-HT than DA.

The rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5%) strip film showed
excellent sensitivity to 5-HT and electrocatalytic activity to obtain
stable and improved current responses compared to DA. The developed
strip sensor was able to enhance oxidation signal separation between
5-HT and DA, even though they have competitive adsorption. Besides,
5-HT and DA are cations that can strongly be applied to nafion’s
skeleton (negatively charged polymer) and enhance the electron mobility
in turn.24 It has been suggested that introducing
nafion strengthens the analyte’s signal and reduces the effect
of electroactive interferences at the same time.32

Amperometric Detection of 5-HT and DA
Figure 4a illustrates the amperometric
test to investigate the effect of dopamine interference on the 5-HT
signal at 0.4 V by increasing the 5-HT concentration from 0.1 to 10
μM under moderate and constant stirring. The current signal
of the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5%) electrode increased
rapidly after each addition of 5-HT and then reached a stable-state
current within 2 s, showing the fast oxidation behavior of 5-HT. The
amperometric current–time curve showed that the pre-existing
DA did not interfere with the oxidation of 5-HT. This could be ascribed
to the significant electrocatalytic activity of the fabricated strip
electrode and remarkable selectivity of the nafion polymer to 5-HT
oxidation at that potential.24 The current
of 5-HT oxidation signals was calibrated in Figure 4b, revealing a linear relationship between
5-HT concentrations and current responses as per indicated equations
of the anodic current Ipa = 0.9213 C5-HT (R2 = 0.94) for low concentrations and
Ipa = 0.122 C5-HT + 0.9 (R2 = 0.9466) for higher concentrations of 5-HT.

(b) calibration curve of corresponding 5-HT concentrations vs current
response.

Conclusions
In summary, we have demonstrated a novel
strip sensor based on
nanostructured hybrid graphene and conducting polymer films for separate
and simultaneous detection of 5-HT with dopamine. The as-developed
rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion strip sensor can be manufactured
through simple drop-casting and is capable of rapid electrochemical
detection of 5-HT in the presence of DA. The as-prepared strip sensor
enabled detection of lower concentrations of 5-HT than previously
reported for electrochemical sensors. Indicative anodic peaks of 5-HT
and DA were noticed at 0.34 and 1.6 V, respectively, showing excellent
selectivity to 5-HT. Moreover, a detection limit of 5-HT as low as
0.1 μM was indicated. The as-prepared strip sensor is reusable
and demonstrated excellent sensitivity and selectivity of 5-HT detection
when presented with dopamine simultaneously. It can be concluded that
the as-prepared rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion strip sensor may
be a promising device in 5-HT detection with potential for use in
medical clinical application.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Serotonin (5-HT, 5-hydroxytryptamine) (C10H12N2O), dopamine hydrochloride (DA,
C8H11NO2·HCL), and ascorbic
acid (AA, C6H8O6) were bought from
Sigma-Aldrich. 5-HT, DA, and AA solutions were instantly prepared
with phosphate-buffer saline (PBS) buffer before every single electrochemical
testing. The blank PBS solutions were purged with nitrogen (N2) to obtain oxygen-free electrolytes. Nafion (5%) was supplied
by ion Power, Inc. PEDOT/PSS pellets were obtained from Agfa, and
graphite flakes were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.12

Fabrication and Modification of rGO–PEDOT/PSS Strip Sensors
The procedure for the preparation of rGO–PEDOT/PSS dispersion
is based on a pre-reported method.31 The
rGO–PEDOT/PSS dispersion (200 μL) was carefully drop-casted
onto a gold mylar substrate. Glass slides had defined the dimensions
of a single film (2 × 1 cm2). The mass loading per
area of rGO–PEDOT/PSS equals 0.19 mg/cm. The films were left
overnight on the bench to dry. Then, the films were split into four
strips using a specific sharp blade, and each strip was used for the
electrochemical sensing experiments as an individual electrode.

To modify with nafion, the obtained rGO–PEDOT/PSS dispersion
was directly mixed with a nafion solution to find out optimized conditions
for sensor fabrication. Therefore, the following composites were prepared:
(i) the composite containing 4000 μL of rGO–PEDOT/PSS
dispersion and 1000 μL of concentric nafion (5%) and (ii) the
composite containing 4000 μL of rGO–PEDOT/PSS dispersion
and 1000 μL of diluted nafion (0.5%). When the preparation step
was completed, each composite was sonicated for 20 min and 200 μL
was withdrawn and drop-casted on two separated gold mylar substrates
to prepare rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion films, which were split
into strips as well. Fabrication methods of rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
strips are illustrated in Figure 1.

Preparation of sensor components including
the concentration of
each component, the mass of rGO–PEDOT/PSS, the ratio of nafion
in the composites, and films’ dimensions are all described
in Table 1. To prepare
rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion (0.5 wt %) composite films, the
following amounts of the composite were dropped onto gold mylar substrates:
100, 200, 300, and 400 μL. The thickness of each type of rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5 wt %) film was measured using a profilometer and shown in Table 2. As can be seen in Table 2, the thickness of
as-prepared films increased from 0.52 to 3.8 μm for 100 to 400
μL samples, respectively. The measured thickness is corresponding
to the dropped amounts of the composite as the size of the substrate
was constant. These results indicated that the preparation method
of the films was precise and well controlled (figure 5).

The electrochemical performance of the four films
was investigated
toward 5-HT with DA simultaneously. The obtained voltammetric results
indicated the contribution of film thickness to strip performance
when the testing conditions are the same during all of the experiments
such as the concentration of targeted analytes, film size, and input
parameters. The obtained results suggested that as-prepared strip
sensors with 200 μL of the rGO–PEDOT/PSS–nafion
(0.5 wt %) film showed higher sensitivity and selectivity for 5-HT
among other prepared sensors.

Characterization of the As-Prepared rGO–PEDOT/PSS Strip
The morphology of (rGO–PEDOT/PSS with and without nafion)
strips was determined using field emission SEM (FESEM), JEOL7500FA
(JEOL Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Raman and FTIR spectroscopies were carried
out using a Jobin Yyvon Horbia 800 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Edison, NJ)
and the Shimadzu AIM8000 FTIR Spectrometers (Shimadzu Corporation,
Kyoto, Japan).22

Electrochemical Characterization of the rGO–PEDOT/PSS
Strip
Cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry
(DPV) were essential voltammetric techniques conducted using a CH
Instruments electrochemical workstation (CH Instruments, Inc., model
660D, made in the U.S.A.). A three-electrode setup system was used
where an rGO–PEDOT/PSS film was used as a working electrode
(WE), Pt mesh was used as the counter electrode (CE), and Ag/AgCl
(in 3M NaCl) was used as the reference electrode. Phosphate-buffer
saline (PBS) (at pH = 7.4) was the basic electrolyte in all experiments.
The high and low potentials (E) were set at +0.6
and −0.1 V, respectively, in CV testing with applied scan rates
ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 (V/s). For DPV detection, the parameters
were as follows: Incr. E = 0.004, amplitude = 0.05,
pulse width = 0.05, and pulse period = 0.2.
