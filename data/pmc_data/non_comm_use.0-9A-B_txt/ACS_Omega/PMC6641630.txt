The
effect of magnetic fields on the precipitation patterns of
Mn–Fe-based Prussian blue analogues in water–glass gels
was studied using X-ray fluorescence and X-ray absorption near-edge
structure spectroscopies. Three sets of two glass tubes, A, B, and
C, were prepared using 1.20 M Mn2+/0.24 M [Fe(CN)6]3–, 0.60 M Mn2+/0.12 M [Fe(CN)6]3–, and 0.30 M Mn2+/0.06 M [Fe(CN)6]3– solutions, respectively. From each of
these sets, one tube was subjected to a magnetic field of 0.5 T, whereas
the other was not. The magnetic field barely affected the Liesegang
bands in the tube from Set A, but there were noticeable differences
in the tubes from sets B and C, where (1) the amounts of electrolytes
were small, (2) the dominant Mn species was [Mn(H2O)6]2+, and (3) there was stochasticity of the band
formation. In these regions, the magnetic field painted out the spaces
between the precipitation bands, even enhancing the formation of additional
bands.

Introduction
Precipitation reactions coupled with diffusion
can spontaneously
create complex product structures with interesting features.1,2 Among such structures, some of the most well-known structures are
the Liesegang bands,1,3,4 that
is, the periodic precipitate bands of the slightly soluble inorganic
compounds that are mostly present in gel media and named after R.
E. Liesegang, who discovered them in the late 19th century.3 In recent decades, Liesegang bands have again
become the subject of intense research interest partially because
they can be applied to the rational design of systems that form functional
devices in micro- and nanoscale through controlled self-organization
processes.5

Practical applications
of Liesegang bands in materials science/engineering
require a deeper understanding of how precipitation bands are influenced
by extrinsic factors that can be controlled from outside the gels.
Considerable effort has already been expended on investigating the
effects of extrinsic factors such as temperature gradient,6 visible-light,7 microwave
radiation,8 and gravitational9 and electric fields10,11 on band formation. Different extrinsic factors influence Liesegang
bands in different ways. For example, the gravitational force occasionally
reduces the space between Liesegang bands,9 and the time-dependent electric current can partially control both
band spacing and band width.11

Magnetic
fields can also influence the self-organization patterns
that are formed by various reaction–diffusion processes,2,12−14 even if the existent magnetic interactions are relatively
weak. For example, Boga et al. found that the magnetic fields cause
a change of several orders of magnitude in the velocity of the propagating
reaction-front in cobalt-catalyzed auto-oxidation of benzaldehyde
in glacial acetic acid.12 Nevertheless,
over the decades, there have been very few studies on the effect of
a magnetic field on Liesegang bands. In 2014, Zhao et al.13 found that a static magnetic field (0.4 T) could
change the geometric morphologies of the Liesegang bands of silver
dendrite observed on the surface of a liquid. Very recently, Ibrahim
et al.14 studied the magnetic-field-induced
effect on the fractal structures of silver dendrite and discussed
the differences between their results and those of Zhao et al.13 To the best of our knowledge, the effect of
a magnetic field on the Liesegang bands that form in the gel media
(i.e., the traditional Liesegang bands) has not been reported yet.

In the present study, the magnetic-field-induced effect on the
periodic precipitation bands (including Liesegang bands) of Mn–Fe-based
Prussian blue analogues (Mn–Fe PBAs) formed in water–glass
gels has been examined. Mn–Fe PBAs form Liesegang bands in
a water–glass gel,15 and their precipitation
bands exhibit interesting gel-state dependencies.16 The observed magnetic-field-induced changes were investigated
by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure
(XANES) spectroscopies, as described in previous studies,15,16 to monitor the variations in the Mn and Fe elemental distributions
(XRF) and to study the local atomic structures around the Mn atoms
in the Mn–Fe PBAs (XANES). The local structure around the Fe
atoms in the Mn–Fe PBAs was expected to be Fe(CN)6.15,17−19

Results and Discussion

Observed Effect of a Magnetic Field on Periodic Bands
Figure 1 shows the
images of the developed periodic bands for the three sets A, B, and
C of two tubes each, for which the preparation conditions are summarized
in Table 1, after one
of which was subjected to a static magnetic field of 0.5 T and one
was not (0 T). Photographs of sets A, B, and C were captured at 211,
359, and 285 h after the addition of the outer electrolyte (Mn2+) sols.

As observed in a previous study,15 relatively
sharp, periodic, brown bands formed in the inner electrolyte gel of
the set A tube had not been subjected to the magnetic field (Figure 1a). The precipitation
bands were found to be very dependent on slight differences in the
initial sol states because the bands formed through diffusion processes
coupled with chemical reactions, with the inherent randomness that
makes the resultant patterns highly sensitive to the initial conditions.4 Nevertheless, additional two re-experiments for
the set A conditions (at 0 T, not shown here for simplicity) revealed
that the numbers of discrete bands in the tubes were approximately
constant (9 ± 2), and that the band locations x1, x2, ..., xn, as acquired from the gel junction,
always separated according to a constant ratio of xi+1/xi (=1.064 ± 0.013). In other words, the periodic bands
in the set A tubes formed rather constantly and obeyed the spacing
law (xi+1/xi = const), which is the one of the best-known
scaling laws governing Liesegang bands.4,5,20 In addition, the value of xi+1/xi (∼1.06) is typical of the systems producing Liesegang
bands (1 < xi+1/xi < 1.5)5 and is very close to that of Mn–Fe PBA systems in
which the Liesegang bands form (∼1.05).15 These results show that the Mn–Fe PBA Liesegang
bands in the set A tubes were more stable than expected.

As
shown in Figure 1a,
the 0.5 T magnetic field had very little influence on the formation
of the Liesegang bands in the set A tubes. The additional two re-experiments
performed for the set A conditions (not shown here for simplicity)
revealed no difference in the band numbers or ratios of the band locations,
regardless of whether the magnetic field was applied, within the inherent
uncertainties described above. These results suggest that the magnetic-field-induced
effect on the Liesegang bands of Mn–Fe PBAs was insignificant,
at least, for the preparation conditions for set A.

In contrast,
the precipitation patterns for the set B tubes exhibited
significant changes as a result of the applied magnetic field (Figure 1b). Here, the 0.5
T magnetic field painted out the spaces between the bands and enhanced
the formation of additional bands at the bottom, colorless area. These
observations imply that the magnetic field activated the formation
of Mn–Fe PBAs precipitates at their low-concentration regions
(or “blank” regions).

Note that for set B (where
the initial concentrations of the inner
and outer electrolytes are half of those for set A; see Table 1), the periodic bands were minimal,
and their bandwidths were relatively broad. Similar observations have
already been reported for the precipitation bands of low-concentration
regions in a Pb(NO3)2–KI system.21 Furthermore, a subsequent study of the Pb(NO3)2–KI system22 revealed that the probability of band formation and reproducibility
of the band location become increasingly stochastic as the amount
of electrolyte in the gels decreases. Thus, because the stochasticity
in the set B tubes is expected to be higher than that in the set A
tubes, the additional two re-experiments were again conducted for
the set B conditions. The results are shown in Figure 2 (where set B-1 corresponds to set B in Figure 1b).

Figure 2 Captured images of the
developed periodic bands in set B without
(0 T) and with a magnetic field (0.5 T). The set B results in Figure 1b are reproduced
as (a) set B-1 for comparison. Sets (b) B-2 and (c) B-3 were prepared
under the same initial concentrations of both the electrolytes for
checking the reproducibility, and images B-2 and B-3 were captured
at 209 and 213 h after the addition of the outer electrolyte sols,
respectively.

As shown in Figure 2, the three set B
patterns for the tubes that had not been subjected
to the magnetic field (0 T) were overall similar, but somewhat different
from one another, particularly in terms of the band thickness, which
probably reflected the increasing stochasticity. Nevertheless, the
0.5 T magnetic field always painted out the spaces between the bands
and even occasionally enhanced the formation of additional bands,
despite the stochastic properties observed in the 0 T results. Thus, Figure 2 strongly suggests
that the magnetic-field-induced, painting-out effect is not spurious
but certainly exists beyond inherent stochastic uncertainties.

Figure 3 shows the
spatiotemporal evolution of the set B-2 patterns. The elapsed time
after the addition of the outer electrolyte sols is indicated at the
bottom of each image. Initially, a short brown band was formed near
the gel junction and propagated downward through the tubes. After
18 h, when the continuous band had propagated to ∼8 mm below
the junction to form a turbid zone, a relatively thin band (indicated
by yellow arrows in Figure 3) was observed at the reaction-front (∼14 mm below).
Until this time, no marked magnetic effect was observed in the set
B-2 patterns. After 42 h, both the reaction-front and the continuous
band were further extended downward, and other considerably thin,
discrete bands were produced between the two bands. After 66 h, the
reaction-front band reached the bottom of the tubes. Unlike the case
of the radical reaction system,12 no significant
magnetic-field effect on the propagation of the reaction-front was
observed. Meanwhile, thin periodic bands were newly formed between
the reaction-front and the turbid zone around this elapsed time. Up
to ∼160 h, while the positions of the periodic bands were almost
maintained, the color of these bands continued to darken and the band
spaces were gradually painted out, suggesting the growth of Mn–Fe
PBA particles over wide regions. From ∼70 h, the 0.5 T magnetic
force noticeably enhanced these darkening and painting-out phenomena
(see images taken at 66, 90, and 162 h). At ∼200 h, the patterns
were well-developed, showing almost no change over time, as seen in
the image taken at 209 h.

Figure 3 Spatiotemporal evolution of set B-2 patterns.
Elapsed time after
the addition of the outer electrolyte sols is indicated at the bottom
of each image. Yellow arrows indicate the positions of the propagating
reaction-front.

Modern theories have
explained the formation of Liesegang bands
as an interplay among several elementary events, including diffusion,
reaction, supersaturation, nucleation, formation of homogeneous colloidal
sols, and ripening.23,24 As described above, the time-dependence
of the set B-2 patterns strongly suggests that the magnetic-field-induced,
painting-out effect is closely related to particle growth and ripening,
which occur gradually and become significant at later stages in band
formation.

A similar painting-out effect was also observed for
the set C patterns
(Figure 1c). However,
the effect observed for set C was somewhat more obscure than that
observed for set B. Furthermore, the lower electrolyte concentrations
of set C (for which the initial concentrations of the inner and outer
electrolytes are half of those of set B; see Table 1) caused the band thickness to markedly decrease
along with a further increase in the bandwidths, suggesting an increase
in the stochasticity. Thus, as the small amounts of both the Mn and
Fe species disturbed the accurate X-ray spectroscopic measurements
and seemed to increase stochasticity, it was difficult to elucidate
the effect of magnetic field. Consequently, we have only focused on
the results from set B in the following sections.

Mn and Fe Kα
Intensity Distributions with/without Magnetic
Field
The Mn and Fe Kα intensity distributions of the
fully developed bands in the tubes of set B (B-1 in Figure 2a; at ∼360 h after the
addition of the outer electrolyte sols), which were either subjected
or not subjected to a magnetic field (0.5 T), are shown in Figure 4. The horizontal
axis in Figure 4 indicates
the distance from the gel junction (X). Its value
is positive at the bottom of the tubes. The vertical axis is the relative
XRF intensity, where the Fe Kα intensity at the bottom of the
tubes in the initial stages (∼1 h after the addition of the
outer electrolyte sols; not shown here for simplicity) was set to
1, according to the procedure used in a previous study.16 These XRF distributions have been compared with
the positions of the brown bands by displaying the corresponding images
at the top of this figure.

Figure 4 Mn and Fe Kα intensity
distributions of the fully developed
bands in set B tubes subjected/not subjected to the 0.5 T magnetic
field. The distributions were obtained at ∼360 h after the
addition of the outer electrolyte sols. Captured images are displayed
at the top of the figure to facilitate a comparison of the XRF distributions
with the positions of the brown region. The vertical dashed line and
hatched area serve as guides.

Figure 4 shows
that
the effect of the magnetic field on the XRF distribution was minimal.
Particularly, in the turbid zone (0 ≤ X <
15 mm), there was no marked difference in either the Mn or Fe Kα
intensity distributions beyond the experimental uncertainties. However,
for a periodic band zone (X ≥ 15 mm) in which
the magnetic-field-induced paint-out effect was visually observed,
the 0.5 T magnetic field noticeably increased both the Mn and Fe Kα
intensities. This finding suggests that the magnetic field slightly,
but noticeably, enhanced the introduction of Mn2+-related
ions into the periodic band zone to stimulate the formation of Mn–Fe
PBA precipitates there. This suggestion is consistent with the visual
observations in Figures 1b and 2.

It should also be noted that
the XRF intensities of the periodic
band zone (magnetic-field-sensitive zone) were significantly weaker
than those in the turbid zone (magnetic-field-insensitive zone), as
already found for similar systems.15,16 This result
suggests that the magnetic field influences the area in which the
amounts of Mn–Fe PBAs and related electrolytes are relatively
small, although such concentration effects were less noticeable to
the naked eye.

Mn K-Edge XANES with/without Magnetic Field
The Mn
K-edge XANES spectra of the fully developed bands in the tubes of
set B (B-1 in Figure 2a; ∼970 h after the addition of the outer electrolyte sols)
subjected/not subjected to the 0.5 T magnetic field are shown in Figure 5. The spectra were
obtained in the fluorescence mode because the tubes were too thick
(4.0 mm diameter) to allow the use of the transmission mode. As was
noted in previous studies,15,16 the measured fluorescence
(XRF) intensities were weak enough to avoid the self-absorption effects.
The Mn K-edge XANES spectra were recorded at several sampling positions,
indicated by bars in the images in the right-hand panels of Figure 5. These positions
are labeled, for example, “1.5 mm” (1.5 mm below the
junction: X = 1.5 mm).

Figure 5 Mn K-edge XANES
spectra of the fully developed bands in the set
B tubes subjected/not subjected to the 0.5 T magnetic field. XANES
spectra were obtained at ∼970 h after the addition of the outer
electrolyte sols. The positions at which the XANES spectra were recorded
are shown in the right-hand panel.

With the exception of X = 19.5 mm (in the
periodic
band zone), the Mn XANES spectra (entirely within the turbid zone)
were almost the same and mostly independent of both the measuring
positions and the application of the magnetic field. This result suggests
that the local structures and symmetries of Mn–Fe PBAs in the
turbid zone were highly uniform and stable when subjected to the magnetic
field (at least, up to 0.5 T). A possible local structure of the Mn–Fe
PBAs is discussed later.

Figure 6a compares
the 19.5 mm XANES spectrum with the Mn K-edge XANES spectrum for the
deliquescence of Mn(NO3)2·6H2O, obtained by Hayashi and Abe.16 As is
evident from this figure, the 19.5 mm spectrum is almost identical
to the XANES spectrum for Mn(NO3)2·6H2O. This finding indicates that the local structure around
the Mn atoms in the periodic band zone, where the 19.5 mm spectrum
was observed, was almost the same as that of the hydrated Mn2+ ions, [Mn(H2O)6]2+, where the Mn2+ ions are surrounded by six O atoms with an octahedral geometry.16 This result strongly suggests that, in the periodic
band zone, although the brown bands are certainly visible by the naked
eye, the amount of Mn–Fe PBAs is very small and the colorless
[Mn(H2O)6]2+ ions are dominant. This
finding is consistent with the XRF results that point to the magnetic
field enhancing the introduction of Mn2+-related ions in
the periodic band zone. The apparent lack of Mn–Fe PBA contributions
is possibly because of the small amount of [Fe(CN)6]3– ions (and, therefore, Mn–Fe PBAs); the initial
concentration of [Fe(CN)6]3– is one-fifth
that of Mn2+ (see Table 1). The local structures of the few Mn–Fe PBAs
in the periodic band zone have not yet been established. The determination
of these structures will be an interesting future task.

Figure 6 (a) Comparison
of Mn K-edge XANES results obtained for the periodic
band zone (X = 19.5 mm; 0.5 T) and deliquescence
of the Mn(NO3)2·6H2O spectrum.16 (b) Comparison of Mn K-edge XANES of the spectrum
obtained for the turbid zone (X = 1.5 mm; 0.5 T)
and the results of FEFF calculations, “Mn(NCFe)2O4K2” and “MnO6S4”.16 A linear combination
of the FEFF results, “LC”, is also shown.

The turbid-zone XANES spectra obtained in the present
study, of
which the 1.5 mm spectrum (0.5 T) is shown in Figure 6b as an example, are very similar to the
turbid-zone spectra that were previously measured for similar systems.16 The XANES spectrum is characterized by a white
line (∼1.6 at 6552 eV), a second peak at 6560 eV, and a subsequent
shallow valley (∼0.85 at 6575 eV). As was peformed previously,16 the turbid-zone XANES spectrum in Figure 6b was analyzed by trial-and-error
linear combinations of the two theoretical profiles of Mn(NCFe)2O4K2 and MnO6S4. Both profiles were determined in advance using the FEFF code for
model clusters.16 The Mn(NCFe)2O4K2 profile was calculated using a model for
Mn–Fe PBAs, in which the Mn atom is surrounded by two Fe(CN)6 groups and four O atoms (conceivably as H2O molecules),
with two K+ ions inserted into the crystal lattice.16 The MnO6S4 profile was
obtained from a model of aqueous Mn2+ ions, in which four
H2O molecules were replaced by four OS moieties (conceivably
as SO42– ions, the anion of the outer
electrolyte).16

Liquid chromatography
(LC) in Figure 6b,
which consists of Mn(NCFe)2O4K2 and
MnO6S4 in the
ration 0.55:0.45 (11:9), produced the result with the best fit to
the 1.5 mm spectrum. The LC profile reproduced the overall spectral
features and white-line intensity, and the values of 0.55 and 0.45
were the same as those obtained in a previous study.16 These findings suggest that the local structure around
Mn in the turbid zone is basically the same as that addressed in a
previous study16 and is related to the
mixture of Mn(NCFe)2O4K2-type Mn–Fe
PBAs and hydrated Mn2+ ions that are partially coordinated
by SO42– ions, where the ratio of Mn–Fe
PBAs to Mn2+ ions is 11:9 (approximately 1:1).

Cause of Magnetic-Field-Induced,
Painting-Out Effect
Magnetic fields have already been used
as the one of the external
force fields for selectively separating colloidal particles from liquids
(see Figure 7).25−27 Magnetophoresis has also been applied to evaluate the magnetic susceptibility
of several types of particles, including magnetic particles,28 ion-labeled biological particles,28 and polystyrene particles in paramagnetic solvents.29 In these analytical magnetophoresis studies,
the magnetic-field-induced effect has been assumed to be as follows.
When the magnetic forces act perpendicular to the flow axis to drive
magnetically susceptible particles toward the interpolar gap(s) (this
is applicable in our case; see Figure 8), those particles with a high magnetic susceptibility,
such as those including a predominance of [Mn(H2O)6]2+ ions, are attracted by the magnetic forces
and are easily deposited on the zone in the interpolar gap. In contrast,
those particles with a low magnetic susceptibility, such as those
including a predominance of [Fe(CN)6]3– ions, are less attracted by the magnetic forces. Thus, if the magnetic
susceptibility of the particles is different, magnetophoretic separation
is possible, as schematically shown in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Schematic representation of the principle of
magnetophoresis.

The above view of magnetophoresis
suggests that a possible cause
of the magnetic effect currently observed could be subtle but significant
magnetic holding of Mn2+-related particles (including Mn(NCFe)2O4K2-type Mn–Fe PBAs) against
diffusive flow to the bottom of tubes. Such a holding would be significant
to the relatively large (colloidal size) paramagnetic particles. Hence,
the magnetic holding effect is expected to become apparent at later
stages of band formation, where many Mn–Fe PBA particles ripen.

By assuming the (subtle) magnetic holding effect, the observed
painting-out effect can be interpreted as follows. Magnetic holding
can increase the coagulation of Mn–Fe PBA precipitates. Here,
as already discussed, for the set B tubes (as well as set C tubes),
the stochasticity of the formation of Mn–Fe PBA precipitates
is expected to be relatively high. Therefore, the increased coagulation
may not only provide thick periodic bands but also enhance the growth
of precipitate particles throughout the inner gel, therefore painting
out the spaces between the periodic bands and occasionally leading
to the formation of additional bands.

In our interpretation,
the key factor to produce the painting-out
effect is the stochasticity accompanied with lower electrolyte concentrations,
and 0.5 T magnetic field is a cofactor. Therefore, painting-out does
not necessarily require the use of a magnetic field. For example,
the painting-out effect occurs when some impurities are introduced
into the inner gels to increase the heterogeneous nucleation. In fact,
for a CuCl2–K2CrO4 system,
Lagzi observed that the addition of a small amount of gelatin (impurity)
into agarose gel (supporting gel) produced similar effects, that is,
the spaces between the CuCrO4 Liesegang bands narrowed,
and the length of the turbid zone increased.30

In the study of magnetic effects, the magnetic field intensity
and direction dependencies of systems are generally interesting subjects.
In fact, such dependencies were investigated for pattern formation
in silver dendrite systems.13,14 Unfortunately, because
the painting-out effect observed here was basically minimal and considerably
stochastic, it is difficult to accurately examine these dependencies
using the present setup. Details of the dependencies need to be investigated
further using a high-power, superconducting electromagnet.

Conclusions
The magnetic-field-induced effect on the Mn–Fe PBA precipitation
bands in water–glass gels can be summarized as follows. This
effect is basically minimal. In fact, the turbid zone of set B tubes,
in which relatively large amounts of Mn–Fe PBAs [for which
the dominant local structure is possibly Mn(NCFe)2O4K2] occur uniformly, was insensitive to the magnetic
field. Furthermore, the typical Liesegang bands of the Mn–Fe
PBAs of set A tubes, which were formed from concentrated, initial
solutions, were also barely influenced by the magnetic field. Nevertheless,
the magnetic-field-induced effect was certainly noticeable in those
regions in which (1) the amounts of both the inner and outer electrolytes
were small, (2) the dominant Mn species was [Mn(H2O)6]2+, and (3) stochasticity was observed in the
precipitation pattern formation. For such regions in the gels, the
magnetic field painted out the spaces between the precipitation bands
from ∼70 h after the addition of the outer electrolyte sol,
even enhancing the formation of additional bands. A possible cause
of this effect is the subtle but significant magnetic holding of the
Mn2+-related particles including Mn(NCFe)2O4K2-type Mn–Fe PBAs and the resultant increase
in the coagulation of Mn–Fe PBAs.

Thus, we demonstrated
that a static 0.5 T magnetic field can be
an independent parameter that can change the precipitation patterns
in gels, even in the classical setups employed for Liesegang band
studies. Our results not only provide an insight and better understanding
of the precipitate band formation but also exhibit the potential for
the application of magnetic fields to the control and engineering
of precipitate structures of functional Mn–Fe PBAs in future
self-organization processes.

Materials and Methods
Materials
Analytical
reagent-grade K3[Fe(CN)6] and MnSO4·H2O were obtained from
Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. (Osaka, Japan) and used as it is
without further purification. Acetic acid (1.00 M) and sodium silicate
solution [water–glass (or liquid–glass), 52–57%
assay, 2.06–2.31 SiO2/Na2O mole ratio]
were also acquired from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Ltd. All aqueous
solutions were prepared using deionized water.

Magnets
A magnetic
field was generated by assembling
a pair of neodymium–iron–boron (Nd–Fe–B)
magnets (EM-112150P, Echo Electronics Co., Ltd., Japan), which conducted
magnetic flux into the interpolar gap. The diameter and thickness
of each magnet was 50 and 16 mm, respectively. The magnetic field
intensity was 0.5 T for a gap width of 11 mm.

Tube Preparation
Quartz glass tubes containing the
inner and outer electrolytes were prepared as follows. For the inner
electrolyte ([Fe(CN)6]3–), 1.6 g of water–glass
was dissolved in deionized water (10 mL) to prepare 13.8 mass % of
sol. Then, appropriate amounts of K3[Fe(CN)6] were added to deionized water (5 mL) to prepare 0.06, 0.12, and
0.24 M [Fe(CN)6]3– solutions. The sol
and [Fe(CN)6]3– solutions were mixed,
after which acetic acid was added (16 mL, 0.53 M). The resultant water–glass
sols were stirred continuously for 20 s and then transferred to quartz
glass tubes with a length of 80 mm, inner diameter of 4.0 mm, and
thickness of 0.010 mm (Mark-tube, Hilgenberg GmbH, Germany) using
a Pasteur pipette. The sol solidified to a gel within 10 min. Its
height in the tubes was ∼30 mm.

For the outer electrolyte
(Mn2+), 1.2 or 1.4 g of water–glass was dissolved
in deionized water (10 mL) to prepare a 10.7 or 12.3 mass % sol. Then,
appropriate amounts of MnSO4·H2O were added
to deionized water (5 mL) to prepare 0.30, 0.60, or 1.20 M Mn2+ solutions. The sol and Mn2+ solutions were mixed,
after which acetic acid was added (16 mL, 0.53 M). The resulting water–glass
sols were stirred continuously for 20 s and then poured over the inner
electrolyte ([Fe(CN)6]3–) gel using a
Pasteur pipette. The outer electrolyte (Mn2+) sol solidified
to a gel within 10 min. Its height in the tube was ∼20 mm.
After solidification of the outer electrolyte gel, approximately 1
mL of deionized water was poured on top of the gels to prevent them
from drying and cracking. The tubes were then closed with silicone
rubber stoppers.

Three sets of the two tubes, A, B, and C, for
which the preparation
conditions are summarized in Table 1, were used in the current experiments. The two tubes
in each set were prepared using the same inner and outer electrolyte
sols as those used with and without the magnetic field. In these preparations,
the ratio of the outer electrolyte concentration to the inner electrolyte
concentration was set to 5. This is the ratio under which the Liesegang
bands had formed in a previous study.15 It should be noted that dense water–glass gels tend to produce
genuine Mn–Fe PBA Liesegang bands,16 but the coupling of concentrated electrolyte solutions and dense
water–glass often leads to rapid (<60 s) and nonuniform
gelation. Therefore, the 13.8 mass % of the water–glass sol
was not employed for the outer electrolyte ([Mn2+] ≥
0.30 M), whereas the 10.7 mass % water–glass was applied for
the 1.20 M Mn2+ solution in set A.

For each set,
one tube was placed in a 0.5 T magnetic field perpendicular
to the diffusive flow axis of the outer electrolyte for ≥14
days and then mounted on a fabricated holder [acrylic resin, 80 ×
35 × 10 mm (h × w × d)] together with the other “control” tube
(that had not been subjected to the magnetic field) for monitoring
and XRF/XANES measurements, as shown schematically in Figure 8. The height and width of the
holders were graduated in millimeter to enable easy measurements of
the band positions in the tubes.

experiments including sample
tubes’ settings and in situ XRF measurements.

Monitoring of Precipitation Patterns
After the addition
of the outer electrolyte sol to the inner electrolyte gel, Mn2+ ions diffused into the inner electrolyte gel and reacted
with [Fe(CN)6]3– to yield Mn–Fe
PBAs. Consequently, brown bands were formed in the inner electrolyte
gels, as shown in Figures 1–3. The patterns of the bands at room temperature (20
°C) were recorded for 40 days using a digital camera to take
intermittent in situ XRF measurements for each tube set. The Mn K-edge
XANES spectra of the developed bands (i.e., those exhibiting few further
changes over time) in the tubes were also obtained. The patterns in
sets A–C were well-developed after 210 h (9 days).

XRF Measurements
The laboratory XRF measurements were
performed, as described in previous studies.15,16,31 A schematic representation of the setup
is shown in Figure 8. As the excitation source, Cu Kα1 X-rays from an
18 kW X-ray generator (RU-300, Rigaku, Japan), operating at 40 kV
and 106 mA, were used. These were focused within 0.5 mm in the horizontal
direction by a SiO2 (101̅1) Johansson-type crystal
monochromator.31 The divergence of the
X-rays in the vertical direction was limited by a handmade collimator
with a 0.5 mm slit. Two sample tubes of each set (subjected/not subjected
to the magnetic field) in a holder were placed on a computer-controlled X–Z stage (XA05A-L2, Kohzu Precision,
Japan). Of the two tubes, one was selected for the XRF measurements
by moving the holder in the X direction and then
in the Z directions in 1 mm steps. The XRF signals
at each Z position were detected using a silicon
PIN detector (XR-100CR, Amptek Inc., USA), for which the detection
angle relative to the incident beam was set to 135°. The XRF
signals were collected for 90 s at each Z point by
a multichannel analyzer (MCA8000A, Amptek Inc., USA). The collection
of a complete XRF distribution over 50 mm of the tube took ∼4500
s. After subtracting the background from the Mn and Fe Kα peaks,
the integrated intensities of these peaks were used to obtain the
Mn and Fe Kα distributions in the tubes. Furthermore, the overlap
of Mn Kβ and Fe Kα lines in the region containing both
elements was corrected using a previously reported method.31 After the completion of these analyses, the
other tube was selected for the XRF measurements by moving the holder
in the X direction, after which the procedure was
repeated. For each XRF measurement, the intensity of the incident
X-rays was monitored by an ion chamber, with the variation within
2%.

XANES Measurements
XANES measurements for the Mn–Fe
PBA gels were performed as described in previous studies.15,16 The XANES spectra at the Mn K-edge were collected at the BL-9C bending-magnet
beamline at KEK-PF, High Energy Accelerator Research Organization,
Tsukuba, Japan. The sample tubes, secured in their holder, were placed
on a computer-controlled Z stage (ALV-102-HP, Chuo
Precision Industrial, Japan). XANES spectra were collected at room
temperature at 6450–6750 eV.

XANES measurements were
conducted in fluorescence mode by placing a Lytle-type detector perpendicular
to the incident beam. After approximating the spectra observed at
6450–6520 eV (the region before the Mn pre-edge) to be straight
lines and subtracting this background component, the obtained XANES
spectra were normalized by assuming that the average absorption coefficients
for Mn would be the same at energies of 6700–6750 eV. Normalized
XANES data were used to examine the local structures around the Mn
atoms in the gels.
