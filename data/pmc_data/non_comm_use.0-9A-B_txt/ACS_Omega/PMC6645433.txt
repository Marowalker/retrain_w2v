Hydroxyapatite (HAp) was successfully
synthesized from egg shells,
a low cost and easily available biodegradable waste, by the precipitation
method and characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron
microscopy, Fourier transform infrared, and Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analysis. The surface area of HAp was found to
be 144 m2/g with a crystalline size of 9–99 nm from
the BET and XRD data. The maximum fluoride removal efficiency within
1 h using 0.3 g of the synthesized adsorbent at pH 6 was 95%. The
adsorption of fluoride followed second-order kinetics, indicating
that chemisorptions are the rate-limiting step. The experimental data
were well fitted with Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, validating
both monolayer and multilayer sorption during the fluoride adsorption
onto the porous HAp. The positive adsorption of F– ions at the HAp interface can be attributed to ion exchange/ion
pairing and H-bonding below the pHpzc of HAp (pHpzc = 8), and the negative adsorption can be attributed to the electrostatic
repulsion between O– and F– ions
at alkaline pH. Both physical and chemical adsorption phenomena were
also evidenced from the molecular parking area data. The results of
a batch experiment show that the HAp synthesized from egg shells can
be used as an effective, low-cost adsorbent for fluoride removal from
a contaminated aqueous solution as well as groundwater compared to
other adsorbents.

1 Introduction
Industrialization
and urbanization, leading to the emergence of
several industries, construction of buildings, and extensive use of
luxury products, adversely affect the essentials of life, that is,
air, water, and soil, and hence all life is endangered. As far as
water is concerned, the presence of essential heavy metals/nonmetals
beyond certain threshold concentrations adversely affects both human
beings and aquatic animals in terms of severe health hazards. Among
various noxious ions, fluoride, the most electronegative element in
the halogen family, is considered as the main nonbiodegradable pollutant
because of its higher reactivity and abundance in nature.1 Large amounts of fluoride enter water bodies
from domestic and industrial waste, thereby making them toxic. As
water is the prime requirement for the sustenance of life, the major
intake of fluoride (∼60%) by living organisms is through drinking
water from several sources. Excess accumulation of fluorides within
the human body causes several problems such as pain in bones and joints,
knock knee syndrome, dental decay, and dental and skeletal fluorosis.2 Today, the higher than desirable level of fluoride
(0.6–1.5 mg/L) in drinking water is the main problem in many
parts of the world.3 Thus, the lack of
pure or less polluted drinking water has led to exploring strategies
for optimal defluoridation by developing techniques and synthesizing
materials that are simple, economically viable, environmentally compatible,
and easily transferable. Techniques involving local resources, biodegradable
wastes, and applicable to any concentration of contaminants are also
preferable.

Until now, among various reported methods used for
defluoridation,
adsorption has been the most successful and cost-effective method
used in the removal of F– ions at low concentrations.4 The viability of adsorption techniques significantly
depends on the development of high-quality adsorbent materials with
optimum efficiency and the required sorption capability.5 The materials developed for this purpose include
hydrated cement,6 alumina containing bauxite,7 activated carbon,8 calcite,9 fly ash,10 red mud,11 synthetic hydrous
Fe(III) oxide,12 Zr(IV) oxides,13 lime and Al salts,14,15 and La-impregnated silica gel.16 Apart
from these, adsorbents prepared from natural materials such as dry
powder of holly oak, neem bark powder, lime stone, clay, concrete,
jute, activated carbon, and leaf powder17,18 have also
been reported.

The feasibility of hydroxyapatite (HAp) and its
nanoparticles for
the treatment of waste water and contaminated soils is now well accepted;
literature related to the use of this material is adequately available.19,20 Moreover, HAp is also used as an adsorbent for chromatography to
separate biomaterials and as a raw material for artificial teeth and
bones.21,22 Generally, the tunnels and active sites
on the HAp surface are responsible for the significant improvement
in adsorption phenomenon.23 The effective
interaction between the HAp surface and molecules is related to various
surface characteristics such as surface functional groups, acidity
and basicity, surface charge, hydrophilicity, and porosity.24 Considering these facts, various innovative
methods for the synthesis of HAp have been designed by improving and
integrating the existing technologies. At this juncture, natural dead
biomass enriched in calcium is a suitable substrate for the synthesis
of HAp because of its low cost and abundance in nature, leading to
(i) a green technology through the synthesis of nanoadsorbents from
biodegradable materials, and (ii) waste utilization through product
development using cheaply available waste products generated by human
daily activity.25

This article describes
the synthesis and characterization of HAp
using biodegradable waste egg shells as the starting material and
its fluoride removal efficiency from aqueous solutions. The mechanism
of fluoride sorption at the HAp interface has been established by
experimental studies on the variation of pH, adsorbent dose, time,
initial F– ion concentration, and temperature. Different
kinetic models have been evaluated to determine the rate-controlling
step during the transfer of the adsorbate from the aqueous bulk phase
to the adsorbent surface. The adsorption characteristics have been
analyzed by fitting the initial F– ion concentration–adsorption
data to Langmuir and Freundlich adsorption models. In addition, desorption,
molecular parking area of the F– ion, and reusability
of the adsorbent have been investigated to determine the effectiveness
of the synthesized HAp as an adsorbent.

2 Experimental
Section
2.1 Chemicals Used
The required chemicals,
HCl (35–38%), HNO3 (65%), NaCl (99%), NH3 (35%), (NH4)2HPO4 (99%), SPADNS
(99%) [4,5-dihydroxy-3-(p-sulfophenylazo)-2,7-naphthalene
disulfonic acid trisodium salt], and ZrOCl2·8H2O (98%) were obtained from Merck, India. NaOH (98%) and anhydrous
NaF (99%) were procured from Qualigens Fine Chemicals, India. All
of the chemicals were of analytical reagent grade and used as received
without further purification.

2.2 Collection
of Raw Materials, Synthesis, and
Characterization of HAp
Egg shells of hen (Gallus domesticus) were collected from the local
market of Sambalpur town, Odisha, India. They were cleaned in tap
water and soaked in 2% NaCl solution at ambient temperature for 24
h. Then, the egg shells were dried, crushed, and digested with 50%
NaOH for 72 h to remove the binding materials and organic compounds.
During soaking and digestion, a solid/liquid ratio of 1:2 (w/v) was
maintained. The digested sample was subsequently treated with HNO3 (2 N) till all of the calcium compounds were converted to
calcium nitrate tetrahydrate [Ca(NO3)2·4H2O]. HAp was synthesized from this prepared calcium nitrate
tetrahydrate following the precipitation method.26 Each 25 mL of this solution afforded ∼2 g of HAp
particles.

Thermal stability of the synthesized HAp sample was
determined by subjecting to calcinations at up to 900 °C for
2 h. The mineral phase of the sample was analyzed by powder X-ray
diffraction (XRD) using an X-ray diffractometer (PW-1830; Philips,
Almelo, Netherlands) equipped with a Cu Kα radiation source
(35 kV and 30 mA). Specific surface area was determined using a Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area analyzer (QUANTACHROME model: Autosorb1, Boynton,
Beach, FA) at 77 K. The sample was degassed at 100 °C in vacuum.
Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the surface area was measured
by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption method at liquid nitrogen
temperature. The morphology and porosity of granules were analyzed
using a JEOL JSM-6480LV scanning electron microscope (SEM, Hitachi,
Japan). The functional groups present in the synthesized HAp samples
were determined by recording the IR spectra of the sample in the range
4000–400 cm–1 using the KBr pellet technique
and an Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer
S2000 IR spectrophotometer, USA). The spectral resolution of the instrument
was 4 cm–1. All pH measurements were carried out
using a digital pH meter (Systronics Instruments, India). Fluoride
analysis in the solution phase was carried out using a Shimadzu UV-2450
spectrophotometer (Japan).

2.3 Preparation of Standard
Solutions and Samples
Two solutions, A and B, were prepared
to obtain the Zr-SPADNS solution
required for the spectrophotometric analyses of the F– ion. Solution A was prepared by dissolving 0.958 g of SPADNS in
500 mL of Millipore water. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 0.133
g of ZrOCl2·8H2O in 350 mL of conc. HCl
and subsequently diluting the resulting solution to 500 mL with Millipore
water. Zr-SPADNS solution was obtained by mixing equal volumes of
solutions A and B. The reference solution was prepared by mixing 10
mL of reagent A and 7 mL of conc. HCl in a 100 mL standard flask and
filling it up to the mark with Millipore water. This reference solution
for absorbance measurement was very stable for a month. The fluoride
stock solution was prepared by dissolving 0.221 g of anhydrous NaF
in 1 L Millipore water (1 mL = 0.1 mg of F–). The
standards and fluoride-spiked samples of the required concentrations
(3–40 mg) were prepared by the appropriate dilution of the
stock solution with Millipore water. Quantitative estimation of the
F– ion before and after adsorption was carried out
by following the SPANDS methods27 using
a Shimadzu UV-2450 Spectrophotometer. Various amounts of 0.1 M HCl
or 0.1 M NaOH were added to maintain the pH of the solutions wherever
necessary.

2.4 Adsorption and Desorption
Experiments
Defluoridation studies were conducted using the
synthesized HAp in
batch experiments as a function of contact time, initial F– concentration, pH, adsorbent dose, and temperature. For each study,
0.3 g of dry adsorbent was added to a series of reagent bottles containing
100 mL of 10 mg F– solution and shaken in 250 mL
polyethylene bottles at 300 rpm using a shaker. The solutions were
allowed to settle for 10 min followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm
for 15 min. The containers were tightly stoppered throughout all of
the experiments to avoid concentration change due to evaporation.
The pH of the solution was adjusted to the desired pH whenever required.
The amount of F– adsorbed and adsorption capacities
at equilibrium qe (mg/g) were calculated
using the following equations 1   2  where C0 is the
initial concentration of the adsorbate (mg/L), Ce is the concentration of the adsorbate at equilibrium (mg/L), V is the volume of the solution (L), and W is the mass of the adsorbent (g). The kinetic studies of adsorption
were carried out using a temperature-controlled mechanical stirrer.

Desorption of fluoride followed by regeneration of synthesized
HAp mainly depends on the desorption methods for F– ions from the F–-loaded adsorbent samples. To
investigate the desorption, 100 mL of 10 mg fluoride solution was
treated with 0.5 g of HAp and stirred for 90 min. The residue was
filtered and retreated with 100 mL Millipore water at different pH
values (2–10). The samples were stirred at 300 rpm and room
temperature (25 ± 2 °C) for 1 h and centrifuged. The residual
F– concentration was calculated to determine the
amount of desorption.

2.5 Adsorption Density and
Molecular Parking Area
of F– Ion
Adsorption density plays an important
role in investigating the qualitative and quantitative interactions
of F– ions on the HAp interface. The packing of
F– ions is mainly governed by the number of vacant
OH sites at the interface. To understand the types of interactions
involved in the adsorption of F– ions on the HAp
surface, the adsorption density (Γ)28 and molecular parking area28 of F– ions were calculated using the following equations 3   4  where C1 is the
initial concentration of the adsorbate in mol·dm–3, C2 is the final concentration of the
adsorbate in mol·dm–3 after the adsorption, A is the surface area of the adsorbent in cm2/g, V is the volume of the aliquot in cm3, W is the weight of the adsorbent used in g, and NA is Avogadro’s number.

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 Characterization of Adsorbent
Figure 1a shows
the characteristic
FTIR bands of the synthesized HAp. The wide band near 3342 cm–1 can be attributed to the stretching mode of O–H
and that near 635 cm–1 can be assigned to its bending
mode. The presence of the PO43– group
was confirmed by the appearance of a peak at 1034 cm–1 (ν3 band) for P–O stretching, a double peak
at 562 and 606 cm–1 (ν4 band) for
P–O bending, and a single peak at 963 cm–1 (ν1 band) for the HPO42– group. The characteristic absorption bands at 1386 and 1422 cm–1 can be attributed to the ν3 and
ν1 bands of C–O stretching for the CO32– group. The sharp peak at 873.6 cm–1 can be attributed to the ν4-type
bending vibrations of the C–O group. The presence of these
bands is characteristic of a B-type carbonated HAp, wherein the carbonate
ions occupy the phosphate ion sites.29,30 The presence
of carbonate ions can be attributed to the absorption of CO2 from water.

Figure 1 FTIR spectra of (a) synthesized HAp and (b) F–-loaded HAp.

The FTIR spectrum of
the F–-loaded HAp sample
is shown in Figure 1b. A large broadening in the range of 3242–3565 cm–1 in the FTIR spectrum supported the formation of F-HAp through OH2+···F– linkage.
A similar broadening has also been reported during the formation of
F-HAp (Ca10 (PO4)6(F, OH)) from fluorine
XANES spectra.31 The shifting of peaks
from 556 to 632 cm–1 with concurrent decrease in
the intensities due to the electrostatic interaction of the F– ion onto the HAp surface after the adsorption supported
the presence of apatite-OH, and its replacement with F– ions at the interface.32 The F–OH
linkage was also evident from the shifting of the P–O stretching
peak at 1002–1121 cm–1. The C–O stretching/bending
frequency of the CO32– group at 1383
and 873.6 cm–1 did not shift significantly, confirming
the nonparticipation of the CO32– group
in F– adsorption. The appearance of two new peaks
at 1994 and 2073 cm–1 envisaged the F···H···O
bonding at HAp interfaces in the aqueous phase. Because the OH group
and F– ion have similar dimensions, they can isomorphously
replace each other through ligand exchange.33

The powder XRD pattern of the synthesized HAp shown in Figure 2a was compared to
that of the JCPDS card No. 740565. The high-intensity diffraction
peaks at 23.12, 25.8, 29.45, 32, 39.4, 46.87, 49.65, 53.2, 64, and
77.5° were indexed to the (111), (002), (210), (211), (130),
(222), (213), (004), (323), and (513) crystal planes of HAp, confirming
the crystalline nature34 of the synthesized
HAp. From the (211) plane, the normal crystallite size of the material
was calculated to be 9.08 nm using the Debye Scherrer35 formula (eq 5). 5  where D is the average crystal
size in nm, K is the shape factor/constant and is
equal to 0.9, λ is the specific wavelength of the X-ray used
(0.154 nm), θ is the diffraction angle, and β2θ is the angular width in radians at intensity equal to full width
and half-maximum. The crystal size of HAp was found to be in the range
9–99 nm with the same crystal phase. The smaller crystallite
size is consistent with the large surface area manifested by the synthesized
HAp in this case.

Figure 2 XRD spectra of (a) synthesized HAp and (b) F–-loaded HAp.

After the F– ion adsorption, the major characteristic
peak shifted from 25.8 to 26.2°, 39.4 to 40.2°, 53.2 to
53.5°, and 64 to 64.2° with concurrent decrease in the peak
intensity and decrease in the crystallite size to 7.8 nm using the
same (211) plane (Figure 2b), supporting the incorporation of F– into
the HAp lattice. The decrease in crystallite size (7.8–38.5
nm) after the F– adsorption can be attributed to
the cooperative dispersion of the F–-adsorbed crystals
present in the agglomerated HAp particles. The peak shift can be attributed
to the adsorption of F– ions onto the heterogeneous
surface of HAp through exchangeable cations.36 The adsorption of F– ions might also occur through
either physical or chemical adsorption or both on the HAp surface.

The N2 adsorption–desorption isotherm and pore
size distribution of HAp are shown in Figure 3a,b. The isotherm exhibited a type IV curve
(Figure 3a) with a
hysteresis loop corresponding to a mesoporous material.37 The BET surface area was calculated to be 144.043
m2/g. An abrupt increase in the surface area of the synthesized
powder can be attributed to the removal of volatile materials because
of calcinations at 900 °C. The distribution of pore diameters
was plotted following the BJH nitrogen desorption (Figure 3b). A sharp peak at 38.2 Å
showed that most of the pores have diameters of ∼3.8 nm. The
high value of the surface area indicates that the synthesized material
is a potential adsorbent, and thus the adsorbate could be comfortably
adsorbed on the synthesized HAp surface.

Figure 3 (a) Typical N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms
for HAp and (b) BJH plot of pore size distribution of HAp.

The SEM image of the synthesized HAp clearly indicates
the irregular
but fragile nature of the granules, indicating that the synthesized
minerals for agglomeration have a dense porous surface texture with
a maximum size within 5–7 μm (Figure 4).

3.2 Adsorption
Study of F– Ion
by Batch Experiments
3.2.1 Effect of Adsorbent Dose
The amount
of F– ions (in mg) adsorbed per unit g (qt) and the percentage of removal efficiency
of HAp were calculated as a function of the amount of added HAp to
determine the optimum adsorbent dose for further studies. The results
are shown in Figure 5. The amount of HAp was varied from 0.2 to 1.2 g with a constant
initial F– ion concentration of 10 mg/100 mL and
agitation time of 60 min at room temperature (25 ± 2 °C).
The percentage removal of the F– ion per unit mass
of the adsorbent increased with the increase in the amount of adsorbent
till a plateau of ∼87% was achieved. The increase in removal
efficiency was attributed to the generation of more active sites for
the adsorption of F– ions because of an increase
in the surface area with the increase in the adsorbent dose. The appearance
of a plateau beyond 3 g/L of HAp indicates that at this dose, the
equilibrium between F– ions in a bulk aqueous medium
and the adsorbed fluoride on the HAp surface was established when
the initial F– ion concentration was 10 mg.

Figure 5 Effect of adsorbent
dosage on the adsorption of F– ions onto nanocrystalline
HAp. Experimental conditions: pH = 6;
initial F– ion concentration, 10 mg; contact time,
60 min; and temperature, 25 ± 2 °C.

However, the amount of F– ions adsorbed
per unit
g of HAp (qt) decreased with the increase
in the amount of adsorbent. This is probably because of the predominance
of HAp–HAp interaction over F– ion–HAp
interaction at a higher dose of HAp. At a higher dosage, the interaction
between HAp–HAp particles became stronger, leading to the conglomeration
of exchanger particles.38 Therefore, the
active sites would overlap, hindering appreciable increase in the
effective surface area with dosage. At the adsorbent dose of 3 g/L,
the qt and percentage removal of F– were 3.1 mg/g and 86.3%, respectively. Thus, the 3
g/L dose was maintained in further studies.

3.2.2 Effect
of pH and F– Ion
Adsorption Mechanism
The point of zero charge (PZC) of virgin
HAp was investigated by following the method reported previously.39 The PZC at pH 8 (Figure 6) supported the existence of isolated surface
OH groups on the surface of the synthesized HAp.

Figure 6 Effect of pH on percentage
removal of F– ions
(solid line) and on virgin synthesized HAp (dotted line).

The effect of pH on the surface charge of HAp particles
can be
attributed to the protonation and ionization of the OH functional
groups present at the HAp–water interface. The OH group would
be protonated below pH 8 and ionized above pH 8. The driving force
for the adsorption of a negatively charged F– ion
on such a surface would therefore be due to ion pair formation (F–···OH2+), H-bonding
(F–···H···O), or ion
exchange (F– will exchange OH–). The more the adsorption of the F– ion on the
HAp surface, the more is the percentage of removal. The percentage
of F– ions adsorbed by HAp powder was determined
by varying pH while keeping the rest of the parameters constant. As
shown in Figure 6,
the removal process was found to be insignificant at a low pH. The
removal percentage gradually increased from 54.5% to a maximum of
93.87% at pH 2–6, above which, the removal efficiency decreased
with further increase in pH. Had the adsorption been purely electrostatic
in nature, the removal efficiency would have increased upto pH 8 because
of the facilitation of F–···OH2+ interaction and decreased above pH 8 owing to
the electrostatic repulsion between ionized O– and
F–. The maximum removal at pH 6 clearly indicated
that apart from these interactions, some other mechanisms are also
operating. A literature survey showed that below pH 4.8, the formation
of Ca(OH)2 and stable dicalcium phosphate is facilitated
in an aqueous HAp solution,40 as shown
in eq 6. On the other
hand, under highly acidic conditions, the high value of the mobile
H+ ion concentration favors the formation of weakly ionized
HF, subsequently generating HF2– and
H2F+ through homoassociation (eq 8), thus decreasing the effective
free F– ion concentrations in the solution phase.41 Because of these two phenomena, the maximum
removal of the F– ion occurred at pH 6. The adsorption
of F– ions on the HAp surface containing isolated
OH groups might also occur through ion exchange, forming fluorapatite
according to eq 9, as
is also evident from the FTIR studies. 6   7   8   9  Similar behavior has been
observed for the
adsorption capability of the BSA protein42 and dispersed Blue SBL43 on the HAp interface.
Therefore, the pH was maintained at 6 during further studies.

3.2.3 Effect of Contact Time and Adsorption Kinetic
Studies
The variation of percentage removal of F– ions by HAp with time was studied by varying time in the range of
15–120 min, keeping the adsorbent dose and pH of the medium
at 3 g/L and 6, respectively. The adsorption density of F– ions increased with increase in time until a plateau was attained
at 60 min (Figure 7a), possibly owing to the achievement of the equilibrium of F– ions between the bulk aqueous solution and adsorbed
layer on the HAp surface. The adsorbed layer could be presumed to
be a monolayer after 1 h only if the adsorption occurred through one-to-one
interactions exclusively between F– ions and the
surface OH group because of electrostatic, exchange, or H-bonding
interactions.

Figure 7 (a) Effect of contact time vs percentage removal of F– ions onto HAp, (b) Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetics,
(c) intraparticle
diffusion model, and (d) Elovich model. Experimental conditions: adsorbent
dose, 3 g/L; initial F– ion concentration, 10 mg;
pH = 6; temperature, 25 ± 2 °C.

To understand the mechanism and kinetics of adsorption of
F– ions onto the HAp surface, the experimental data
were
fitted to different kinetic models, and the data were examined.

3.2.3.1 Pseudo-First-Order Kinetic Model
For simple adsorption
processes, the Lagergren pseudo-first-order
kinetics is suitable to cause saturation only for the initial 20–30
min of contact time.44 The kinetic model
is described in eq 10. 10  where qe and qt (both in mg/g) are the amounts of F– ions adsorbed at equilibrium and time t. The adsorption
rate constant, k1 (min–1), was calculated from the plots of ln(qe – qt) versus time. As described
in Figure S1, the correlation coefficient
(R2) and k1 were very low, indicating that the sorption kinetics are not of
first order in this case. Thus, the sorption process would take a
longer time to reach equilibrium.

3.2.3.2 Pseudo-Second-Order
Kinetic Model
The Lagergren pseudo-second-order kinetic model45 is based upon the assumption that it is a one-step
process,
and the rate-limiting step may be chemical adsorption, involving valence
forces by sharing or exchanging electrons between the adsorbent and
adsorbate.46 The phenomenon is best described
by the kinetic eq 11. 11  The rate constant k2 (g/(mg·min))
and qe (mg/g) for
the adsorption of F– ions were evaluated from the
intercept and slope of the linear kinetic plots between t/qt and time (Figure 7b). A high correlation coefficient R2 (0.999) and rate constant k2 (0.108 g/(mg·min)) were obtained from the pseudo-second-order
kinetics equation, indicating that the rate-limiting step involves
chemisorption phenomena. The initial adsorption rate h (mg/(g·min)) was calculated using eq 12 and is shown in Table 1. 12

3.2.3.3 Intraparticle
Diffusion Model
The intraparticle diffusion model47 (eq 13) was used to determine
the occurrence of the intraparticle diffusion mechanism during the
rate-controlling step of F– ion adsorption. 13  As shown in Figure 7c, the plot of qt versus t0.5 produced a straight line
(R2 = 0.941) that did not pass through
the origin, validating the intraparticle diffusion model in the F– ion adsorption process on the adsorbent surface. However,
the low values of the intraparticle diffusion rate constant ki (0.014 mg/(g·min)0.5) and
layer thickness Ci (0.395 mg/g) indicated
that the step involving intraparticle diffusion might not be the sole
rate-limiting step.

3.2.3.4 Elovich Model
The analyses of
adsorption rate data using the Elovich equation (eq 14) show the nature of chemisorption
kinetics (homogenous or heterogenous) and the number of steps (one
step or multiple steps) that contribute to the rate of adsorption.
According to Parravano and Boudart,48 several
different processes, including bulk and surface diffusion as well
as heterogenous chemisorptions of gases on solid surfaces, could be
comfortably described by the Elovich equation49 14  where α is the initial sorption rate
and β is the extent of surface coverage during the chemisorptions.
The parameters α and β were obtained from the intercept
and slope of the linear plot of qt versus
ln t (Figure 7d). The high values of α (3.0291 mg/(g·min))
and β (15.873 g/mg) and R2 = 0.945
indicate that the adsorption follows chemisorption. Thus, the physisorption
mechanism cannot be the only probable mechanism to account for the
adsorption of the F– ion at the HAp/water interface
(Table 1).

3.2.4 Thermodynamics of Adsorption
The
effect of temperature on the progress of adsorption was studied in
the range 15–60 °C with the initial F– ion concentration of 10 mg to ascertain the spontaneity of adsorption,
and eqs 15–17 were used to evaluate the different thermodynamic
parameters. 15   16   17  where ΔG° corresponds
to the Gibb’s free energy change, and ΔS° and ΔH° are the entropy and enthalpy
changes, respectively. Ce is the concentration
at equilibrium (mg/L), R is the ideal gas constant
(8.314 J/(K·mol)), and T is the temperature
in Kelvin. The equilibrium constant, Kc, was obtained from the ratio of qe and Ce (in mg/g). The values of ΔH° and ΔS° were calculated from the
slope and intercept of the van’t Hoff plot of ln Kc against 1/T in Kelvin (Figure 8). The values of
ΔG° at different temperatures were calculated
using eq 18. 18  The values of ΔG°
ranged from −4.162 to −8.23 kJ/mol, indicating that
the adsorption is both physisorption and spontaneous.50 However, the ΔH° values calculated
using eq 15 were positive
(18.57 kJ/mol), indicating that the adsorption is endothermic. The
endothermic nature of the reaction can be attributed to the fact that
at higher temperatures, the free volume of adsorbent pores increases
because of the increased movement of the solute,51 thus enhancing the adsorption unlike the usual adsorption
phenomena. The value of ΔH° within the
range 1–93 kJ/mol indicates that the adsorption is governed
by a physical process.52 The positive value
of ΔS° (80.93 J/mol) can be attributed
to the randomness caused by the release of the solvated water molecules
present on the surface of the HAp because of adsorption. Thus, a rigid
adsorbed layer was formed because of the increase in the randomness
of the surrounding bulk media. The analysis results are shown in Table 2.

of F– ions onto HAp.

3.2.5 Effect of Initial F– Ion
Concentration and Adsorption Isotherm
Batch experiments were
performed to obtain the adsorption isotherm by determining the percentage
of F– ion removal as a function of the initial F– ion concentration (5–40 mg), maintaining the
optimum adsorbent dose and temperature. A maximum of 95.85% removal
was obtained at the initial F– ion concentration
of 10 mg/L; a significant decrease was observed above that (Figure 9a). The higher uptake
of F– ion at a low concentration can be attributed
to the availability of active sites on the surface of HAp for a limited
number of adsorbate species. At a higher concentration, the percentage
removal decreased due to the unavailability of vacant sites on the
surface of HAp to accommodate excess F– ions.

Figure 9 (a) Effect
of initial F– ion concentration vs
% removal of fluoride, (b) Langmuir adsorption plot, and (c) Freundlich
adsorption isotherm. Experimental conditions: adsorbent dose, 3 g/L;
pH of the solution, 6; temperature, 25 ± 2 °C; and contact
time, 60 min.

The relationship between
the equilibrium of F– ion adsorbed and solute concentration
was verified using various
isotherms. A linear Langmuir adsorption isotherm model (Figure 9b and eq 19) valid for monolayer sorption onto a homogenous
surface with a definite number of identical sites53 was tested. 19  where qe is the
amount of F– ions adsorbed at equilibrium (mg/g),
and Ce is the equilibrium adsorbate concentration
(mg/L). The values of the Langmuir constant, b (binding
energy constant) and q0 (monolayer adsorption
capacity in mg/g) relate to the energy and capacity of adsorption,
respectively. To compute the adsorption efficiency, another dimensionless
parameter, r, should be calculated from the binding
constant, b, obtained using eq 20 20  where C0 is the
initial concentration of F– ions (mg/L), and r is the Langmuir isotherm constant. The feasibility of
adsorption can be evaluated from the values of r,
that is, r > 1 (unfavorable), r =
1 (linear), 0 < r < 1 (favorable), and r = 0 (irreversible). The calculated value of r for the initial F– ion concentration of 10 mg/L
was 0.1. The maximum adsorption capacity was 22.3 mg/g. The larger b value (>0.1) indicated the greater affinity of the
adsorbent
toward F– ion adsorption.

The Freundlich isotherm
supports the effectiveness of multilayer
sorption on heterogeneous surfaces. The linear form of the Freundlich
model54 is shown in eq 21, where qe is
the amount of F– ions adsorbed at equilibrium time
(mg/g), Cr is the residual concentration
of F– ions in the solution (mg/L), and Kf and n are Freundlich constants. 21  Depending
upon the nature of adsorbate and
adsorbent, n represents the extent of adsorption
intensity, and Kf represents the adsorption
capacity. Figure 9c
shows that the values of Kf, n, and R2 are 0.044 mg/g, 0.476, and 0.992,
respectively. These values are listed in Table 3. Because both the models provided a good
correlation coefficient, it was assumed that both the sorption models
fit to explain the sorption mechanism.

3.3 Desorption
and Regeneration Studies
Desorption of F– ions followed by regeneration
of synthesized HAp mainly depends on the extent of desorption of the
F– ions from the loaded HAp surface. To ensure the
reproducibility and nature of adsorption, that is, physical or chemical,
the pH variation method (pH 2–10) was selected to desorb the
F– ions from the resulting fluorapatite due to the
adsorption of F– ions. Regeneration (91.59%) could
be achieved at pH 7, indicating ease of regeneration in low alkalinity
of the medium, and hence HAp can be used for several cycles (Figure S2). Under less alkaline conditions, the
F– ion was easily desorbed from the surface of HAp
owing to the significant reduction in (i) the complexation of F– with H+, (ii) positively charged surface
density over HAp, and (iii) increase in the repulsion of the F– ion with the negatively charged adsorbent surface.

3.4 Reusability Study of Adsorbent
Reusability
is an essential part of adsorption studies, indicating the recovery
of the adsorbent and hence the cost effectiveness of the process.
This study was carried out by carrying out several adsorption/desorption
cycles (1–6) with an adsorbent dose of 3 g/L at a temperature
of 25 ± 2 °C. The pH of the solution was maintained at 7,
that is, the maximum pH obtained from the regeneration study. The
maximum % removal of F– ion took place in cycle
1, that is, 94.31% (Figure S3). Thus, the
study shows that the regenerated adsorbent could be used for fluoride
removal to a reasonable extent (up to 63.63% fluoride removal) for
up to the fourth cycle.

3.5 Analysis of Molecular Parking
Area
The molecular parking area, that is, the area occupied
by F– ions at the interface during the maximum adsorption,
shows the qualitative
as well as quantitative interactions of F– ion on
the HAp surface. If the adsorption exclusively occurs through the
direct exchange of OH– with the F– ion, the adsorption would decrease with the increase in pH because
of electrostatic repulsion. The calculated maximum molecular parking
area was 481.4 Å2 (Figure 10) at a lower concentration, which subsequently
decreased to a constant value with the increase in F– ion concentration. This observation is a direct consequence of the
fact that a high adsorption capacity of F– ions
primarily occurs through H-bonding with the surface OH groups along
the channel.55 Again through electrostatic
attraction, the fluorapatite is formed after the kinetically controlled
supersaturation by F– ions. At a higher concentration
of F– ions, besides electrostatic interaction, the
adsorption of F– ions also probably occurred through
the weak London dispersion forces between the adsorbed F– ions and F– ions in the bulk aqueous phase at
the same sites, thereby decreasing the molecular parking area. Therefore,
the adsorption is both physisorptive and chemisorptive in nature.
The validity of both Langmuir and Freundlich equations also supported
our proposition.

vs molecular
parking area.

4 Conclusions
In this study, HAp was synthesized and its fluoride removal efficiency
was investigated. The fluoride removal efficiency of the synthesized
HAp was up to 95% at pH 6.0 within a short time (60 min). Therefore,
the synthesized HAp is useful for commercial applications. The adsorption
of the F– ion followed second-order kinetics, indicating
that chemisorptions are the rate-limiting step. As already noted from
batch experiments, the interfacial conditions may favor the formation
of F–-loaded HAp through either ion pair formation
(F–···OH2+),
H-bonding (F–···H···O),
or ion exchange (F– ions exchange with OH– ions) in the aqueous phase. The temperature has a positive effect
on the percentage of fluoride removal, indicating that the adsorption
of F– ions onto HAp is endothermic and spontaneous.
The adsorption data followed Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms, indicating
that the surface of the adsorbent was heterogeneous. The molecular
parking area analysis showed that the adsorption of F– ions on the HAp surface is governed by both physical and chemical
forces. After desorption, the HAp was easily regenerated and reused
up to four cycles for allowed defluoridation. A comparison of the
efficiency of F– ion removal with previous results
reported so far (Table 4) showed that the synthesized adsorbent is equally effective for
fluoride removal.53,56−64 Because egg shells are calcium-enriched materials, and it is easy
to procure these materials worldwide as a result of daily human activity,
the HAp preparation reported in this study is economical and universally
applicable. Furthermore, because this HAp preparation does not require
extensive preprocessing and is not time consuming, the fluoride removal
process using this HAp is a sustainable and economically viable technology.
