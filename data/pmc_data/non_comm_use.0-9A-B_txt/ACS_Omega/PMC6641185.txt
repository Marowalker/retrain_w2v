We report comparative field electron
emission (FE) studies on a
large-area array of two-dimensional MoS2-coated @ one-dimensional
(1D) brookite (β) TiO2 nanorods synthesized on Si
substrate utilizing hot-filament metal vapor deposition technique
and pulsed laser deposition method, independently. The 10 nm wide
and 760 nm long 1D β-TiO2 nanorods were coated with
MoS2 layers of thickness ∼4 (±2), 20 (±3),
and 40 (±3) nm. The turn-on field (Eon) of 2.5 V/μm required to a draw current density of 10 μA/cm2 observed for MoS2-coated 1D β-TiO2 nanorods emitters is significantly lower than that of doped/undoped
1D TiO2 nanostructures, pristine MoS2 sheets,
MoS2@SnO2, and TiO2@MoS2 heterostructure-based field emitters. The orthodoxy test confirms
the viability of the field emission measurements, specifically field
enhancement factor (βFE) of the MoS2@TiO2/Si emitters. The enhanced FE behavior of the MoS2@TiO2/Si emitter can be attributed to the modulation of
the electronic properties due to heterostructure and interface effects,
in addition to the high aspect ratio of the vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods. Furthermore, these MoS2@TiO2/Si emitters exhibit better emission stability. The results obtained
herein suggest that the heteroarchitecture of MoS2@β-TiO2 nanorods holds the potential for their applications in FE-based
nanoelectronic devices such as displays and electron sources. Moreover,
the strategy employed here to enhance the FE behavior via rational
design of heteroarchitecture structure can be further extended to
improve other functionalities of various nanomaterials.

Introduction
The high aspect ratio
and sharp tip features of one-dimensional
(1D) metal oxide nanostructures have engaged most of the researchers
to explore their electronic/physical properties for the development
of efficient functional devices for energy conversion and conservation.1−4 TiO2 is one of them, but it is explored to a certain
extent for field emission displays despite its low work function of
3.9–4.5 eV.5 The nanotubular geometric
analogy of TiO2 with the carbon nanotubes have engrossed
researcher to investigate their field electron emission (FE) behaviors.5−8 Moreover, dissimilar distortion of TiO6 octahedra produced
the crystalline structures of rutile, anatase, and brookite crystalline
phases. Nevertheless, exploration of limited 1D morphologies of TiO2, random dispersion of TiO2 1D nanostructures,
and electron field screening effect have adverse affect on their further
FE studies.1,9,10 Thermodynamically
most stable β-phase at dimensions of 11–35 nm11 needs to be explored to overcome the field screening
effect by providing homogeneous 1D nanostructures.12 Even though N, Fe, and C were doped to enhance the FE characteristics
of 1D TiO2 nanostructures,6,13,14 the heterostructures of TiO2 with other
metal oxides or conducting materials need to be adopted for further
improving the FE performance for industrial/scientific applications.
Recently, various conducting two-dimensional (2D) materials, including
C,14 MoS2,15−17 and WS2,15 have been introduced as coatings
over metal oxides and vice verse, utilizing complex chemical/physical
processes to produce heterostructures. The metal oxide nanostructures
coupled or modified with a coating to form layered or core–shell
structures have shown significant improvement in their properties
and applications in photocatalysis,15 decompositions
of organic dyes,16 and batteries.17 Among these coating materials, MoS2, a transitional metal dichalcogenide with a layered 2D planar structure
similar to that of graphene and a narrow band gap of 1.7 eV (in the
bulk form), is one of the most promising coating materials.18 Recent report confirms that MoS2 appears
to be a good field emitter because of its unique electronic properties.19 Therefore, the improvement in the FE performance
should be feasible with shell formation of 2D materials over 1D metal
oxide nanostructures. MoS2 nanoflowers and clusters decorated
with ZnO20 and SnO221 nanoparticles delivered a turn-on field of 3.08
and 3.4 V/μm, respectively. The field emitter of amorphous carbon
nanocone shells on TiO2 nanowire cores has provided the
turn-on field of 3.1 V/μm.22 Recently,
Fu et al.23 have reported FE properties
of rutile TiO2 hierarchical network heavily loaded with
MoS2. However, the FE properties were not optimized for
controlled growth of MoS2 layers, and highly dense TiO2 nanorods arranged in the form of dandelion flowerlike morphology
were seldom covered with MoS2. Moreover, morphology characterized
by randomly oriented 1D nanostructures of high areal density suffers
from significant field screening effect, thereby exhibiting poorer
FE behavior. Furthermore, randomly distributed anatase TiO2 nanorods covered with dense MoS2 thin film provided the
turn-on field of 11 V/μm,24 which
is very high compared to pure TiO2 nanostructures and MoS2 layers reported in the literature. Consequently, for promising
FE behavior, it is of scientific and technological importance to grow
vertically aligned 1D β-TiO2 nanorods and furthermore
tailor their electronic properties via the formation of heterostructure
with an ultrathin 2D MoS2 layer.

In this work, we
present 1D β-TiO2 nanorods/2D
MoS2 layered and core–shell nanostructure arrays
as excellent field emitters. The large-area arrays of vertically aligned
TiO2 nanorods of brookite phase were synthesized using
hot-filament metal vapor deposition (HF-MVD) technique, which is a
unique and simple method to provide diverse morphologies and crystalline
structures of various metal oxide nanostructures.25−30 Furthermore, MoS2 layers/shell of desired thicknesses
were grown over β-TiO2 nanorods utilizing the pulsed
laser deposition (PLD) technique, which is one of the advanced, versatile
technologies used for growing layered/shell materials with excellent
adhesion, perfect stoichiometric growth, and better scalability to
smaller geometries.31−34 The influence of MoS2 layer thickness on the structural,
chemical, and FE characteristics was studied. The structural morphology,
electronic structure, and chemical composition of MoS2-coated
β-TiO2 nanorods were examined utilizing X-ray photoemission
spectroscopy (XPS) and field-emission scanning electron microscopy
(FESEM). The comparative FE studies of MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods were performed after the optimization of anode–cathode
separations for pure β-TiO2 nanorods. The MoS2@β-TiO2 nanorod heteroarchitectures with
∼4 nm MoS2 shell thickness exhibited excellent FE
properties.

Results and Discussion
The FESEM images in Figure 1 show the surface
morphology of pure TiO2 nanorods
and MoS2-loaded TiO2 nanorods synthesized on
Si substrate. The top view of a portion of the array in Figure 1a shows a uniform distribution
of TiO2 nanorods over a large area. The vertically aligned
TiO2 nanorods of the average diameter of ∼10 nm
were well separated with their clearly visible textural boundaries
(inset of Figure 1a).
More details on the surface morphological feature of pure TiO2 nanorods are explained elsewhere.12 These as-synthesized 1D TiO2 nanorods were exclusively
composed of orthorhombic crystals in brookite (β) phase assigned
to the space group Pbca (JCPDS – 761936) with
lattice constants a = 0.919 nm, b = 0.546 nm, c = 0.516 nm, and α = β
= γ = 90°. Further, selected area electron diffraction
pattern of nanorods indexed to the [101] zone axis corroborates the
formation of brookite (β)-TiO2 nanorods. A detailed
explanation of the crystalline structure of TiO2 nanorods
is provided elsewhere.12 After the formation
of β-TiO2 nanorods array over a large area was confirmed,
these vertically aligned β-TiO2 nanorods were subjected
to controlled growth of MoS2 layers over the surface of
nanorod body, utilizing the PLD technique. The growth of thin layers
of MoS2 over the β-TiO2 nanorods was controlled
by monitoring the deposition rates at an optimized laser energy density.
FESEM images in Figure 1b,c show the surface morphologies of the MoS2-loaded β-TiO2 nanorods. A close examination of the top view of a portion
of array shows that the entire β-TiO2 nanorods array
is uniformly covered with MoS2 layers. The MoS2 layers of an average thickness of ∼40 (±3 nm), ∼20
(±3 nm), and ∼4 (±2 nm) nm were synthesized at optimized
deposition rates. Details of the single-crystalline MoS2 formation and their thickness variations are provided in Supporting Information. Figure 1b shows the FESEM image of MoS2 thin film over β-TiO2 nanorods array synthesized
at an optimized deposition rate of ∼1000 shots. The uniform
thin film of ∼40 nm thick MoS2 was produced over
a large-area array of β-TiO2 nanorods. The high-magnification
FESEM image in the inset of Figure 1b shows that MoS2 forms a nonporous thin
film of uniform thickness to cover the entire β-TiO2 nanorods array, and no β-TiO2 nanorods are visible
at all. Further, the thickness of MoS2 layer on β-TiO2 nanorods was reduced to ∼20 nm (Figure 1c) by decreasing the deposition rate (∼500
shots). The high-magnification FESEM image in the inset of Figure 1c shows a kind of
growth of nanoparticles of MoS2 over β-TiO2 nanorods array. However, they are not MoS2 nanoparticles
in particular. The growth of MoS2 layers continued distinctly
over the top of β-TiO2 nanorods to deliver nanoparticles
like morphological look, which resulted in a larger surface roughness
than that of MoS2 layers of ∼40 nm thickness over
β-TiO2. The increase in the surface area because
of the roughness is expected to contribute positively to the FE behavior.
The deposition was reduced further to grow only a few layers of MoS2 on vertically aligned β-TiO2 nanorods. The
FESEM image in Figure 1d shows that very thin layer of MoS2 was yielded (at ∼100
shots) on the large-area array of well-separated β-TiO2 nanorods. The overgrowth or island formations of MoS2 was not observed. The high-magnification FESEM image in the inset
of Figure 1d shows
that the β-TiO2 nanorods were shelled with few layers
of MoS2 to form ∼4 nm thick layer. The MoS2 shell might have covered all of the nanorods body. Therefore, the
separation between MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods
(Figure 1d) was less
than that between the as-deposited β-TiO2 nanorods
(Figure 1a). Nevertheless,
TiO2@MoS2 core–shell nanorods were well
separated from each other. At a thickness of ∼4 nm, 6–7
layers of MoS2 are expected to be present based on the
previously reported thickness of 0.7 nm for a monolayer of S–Mo–S
(i.e., MoS2) structure.35 This
confirms that MoS2 shell of ∼4 nm thickness on the
core of β-TiO2 nanorods is converted further into
thin films of thickness ∼20 and ∼40 nm.

Figure 1 FESEM images showing
the top view of the large-area array of (a)
vertically aligned pristine 1D β-TiO2 nanorods on
Si substrate, which were further decorated with (b) 40 nm, (c) 20
nm, and (d) 4 nm layer/shell of MoS2. The inset shows their
respective high-magnification FESEM images.

Independent XPS studies were performed to investigate the
electronic
structure and chemical properties of β-TiO2 nanorods
and MoS2@β-TiO2 nanorods. Figure 2 illustrates the high-resolution
XPS spectra for Ti(2p) and O(1s) recorded after the growth of thin
MoS2 layers of thickness ∼4, ∼20, and ∼40
nm on β-TiO2 nanorods. The middle and lower panels
of Figure 2a,b show
that the intensity of Ti(2p) and O(1s) is almost zero (invariable).
The formation of MoS2 of thickness ∼20 and ∼40
nm on β-TiO2 nanorods resulted in the disappearance
of Ti(2p) and O(1s) peaks because of the allowed fine-depth profiling
only within 10 nm in XPS. The absence of O(1s) peak implies that neither
suboxide/oxidized phases of Mo nor additional oxides were formed along
with MoS2 on the β-TiO2 nanorods. On the
other hand, distinct XPS peaks for Ti(2p) and O(1s) were observed
for the β-TiO2 nanorods array coated with MoS2 of thickness ∼4 nm and are shown in the upper panel
of Figure 2a,b, respectively.
The Ti(2p) XPS spectra were deconvoluted via Voigt curve fitting function
within the Shirley background (upper panel, Figure 2a) to determine the double peak features
of Ti(2p3/2) and Ti(2p1/2) in particular. The
perfect fit for two peaks located at the binding energies of 458.95
and 464.59 eV evidenced Ti(2p3/2) and Ti(2p1/2) core levels of Ti4+ cations only, respectively, and
not of Ti3+ or other suboxides.12,36,37 The Ti(2p3/2) and Ti(2p1/2) peaks with the energy separation of 5.64 eV and the full width
at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1.38 and 2.13, respectively, are akin to
that of pure β-TiO2 nanorods.12 Likewise, O(1s) XPS spectra of β-TiO2 nanorods
(upper panel, Figure 2b) were decomposed via Voigt curve fitting within the Shirley background,
showing the perfect fits to two peaks located at the binding energies
of 530.30 and 531.83 eV with FWHM of 1.45 and 2.06 eV, respectively.
The lower binding energy peak observed at 530.30 eV corresponds to
the O(1s) core level of the O2– anions associated
with the Ti–O chemical bonding (O1sTi–O)12 in β-TiO2 nanorods. However, higher binding peak
at 531.83 eV is attributed to the nanorod surface contamination, such
as carbon oxides or hydroxides.12,38,39 Thus, the double peak features of the XPS spectra of Ti(2p) and
O(1s) shown in Figure 2a (upper panel) and Figure 2b (upper panel), respectively, are akin to that of pure β-TiO2 nanorods. The estimated atomic ratio (i.e., O/Ti ratio) of
∼1.99 (i.e., Ti/O = 1:1.99) of oxygen and titanium is very
close to the stoichiometric ratio (i.e., 1:2) of pure TiO2. These analyses are well consistent with that of the β-TiO2 nanorods revealed earlier.12 These
results indicate that the loading of MoS2 at laser energy
density of 1 J/cm2 did not alter the chemical and elemental
properties β-TiO2 nanorods.

Figure 2 High-resolution XPS spectra
of (a) Ti(2p) and (b) O(1s) core levels
of the large-area array of 2D MoS2@1D β-TiO2 nanorods with 40 nm (lower panel), 20 nm (middle panel), and 4 nm
(upper panel) layer/shell of MoS2. The XPS spectra are
decomposed via Voigt curve function fitting.

Figure 3 illustrates
Mo(3d) and S(2p) high-resolution XPS spectra of the MoS2-loaded β-TiO2 nanorods. Figure 3a,b confirms that the relative intensities
of Mo(3d) and S(2p) peaks remain unaffected for MoS2 of
thickness ∼20 and ∼40 nm loaded on β-TiO2 nanorods. The apparent change in their relative intensities was
observed for ∼4 nm thick shell of MoS2, as that
has reflected in the appearance of intense peaks of Ti(2p) and O(1s)
as shown in Figure 2. Which indicates that there was a significant expense in the intensities
of Mo(3d) and S(2p) peaks and gain in the intensity of Ti(2p) and
O(1s) peaks at ∼4 nm thick MoS2 shell than that
of ∼20 and ∼40 nm thick films. Thus, the change in the
area under peaks reflect a variation in the thickness of MoS2 to form a shell and thin film over β-TiO2 nanorods.
For precise determination of the peak features, XPS spectra were deconvoluted
via Voigt curve fitting function. The deconvolution of Mo(3d) spectra
of ∼4 nm thick MoS2 shell loaded on β-TiO2 nanorods in Figure 3c shows a perfect fit for three peaks. The peaks located at
the binding energies of 228.96 and 232.12 eV, respectively, correspond
to Mo(3p5/2) and Mo(3p3/2) core levels of the
Mo4+ cations in MoS2 and not of Mo6+.40−42 The shoulder peak near Mo(3p5/2) core level located at
a binding energy of 226.27 eV was assigned to S(2s).42,43 The energy separation between Mo(3p5/2) and Mo(3p3/2) peaks of 3.16 eV was (<3.3 eV) assigned to MoS2.42 The FWHM of Mo(3p5/2) and Mo(3p3/2) peaks were 1.25 and 1.46 eV, respectively.
Similarly, deconvolution of S(2p) spectra of ∼4 nm thick MoS2 shell loaded on β-TiO2 nanorods in Figure 3d shows perfect fit
to two peaks located at the binding energies of 161.92 and 163.13
eV, respectively, corresponding to the S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) core levels of S2– of MoS2.43,44 The energy separation between S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) peaks of ≤1.4 was assigned to the
formation of MoS2 and that of ≥1.4 was assigned
to amorphous MoS3.43,44 Therefore, the observed
energy separation of 1.20 eV between S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) peaks reflects the formation of MoS2 only and
not of MoS3 or any other compound. The FWHM of S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) peaks were 1.18 and 1.08 eV, respectively.
Further, for precision determination of MoS2 phase formation,
the XPS spectra of ∼20 and ∼40 nm thick MoS2 loaded on β-TiO2 nanorods were decomposed (Figures S3 and S4). Irrespective of the change
in the thickness of MoS2 layers coated over β-TiO2 nanorods, the Mo(3p5/2), Mo(3p3/2),
S(2p3/2), and S(2p1/2) core levels were located
at the binding energies of 228.97 (±0.01), 232.13 (±0.01),
161.93 (±0.01), and 163.13 (±0.01) eV, respectively. These
peak positions were extremely identical to those observed in ∼4
nm MoS2@TiO2 nanorods, consequently corresponding
to Mo4+ cations and S2– anions, respectively.
Moreover, distinct variation was not observed in the binding energy
of S(2s) peak (i.e., 226.28 (±0.02) eV) appearing as a shoulder
peak near Mo(3p5/2) core level. The FWHM of Mo(3p5/2) and Mo(3p3/2) peaks were 1.21 and 1.39 (±0.02)
for samples loaded with ∼20 and ∼40 nm thick layers
of MoS2, respectively. Similarly, the FWHM of S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) peaks were 1.06 and 1.04 (±0.01)
eV, respectively. The relatively larger FWHM observed for ∼4
nm thick layers of MoS2 compared with ∼20 and ∼40
nm thick layers can be correlated with their size reduction.45 Even after increasing the thickness of MoS2 up to ∼20 and ∼40 nm, the energy separation
between the peaks of Mo(3p5/2) and Mo(3p3/2)
(i.e., ∼3.16 (±0.01) eV) and S(2p3/2) and S(2p1/2) (i.e., ∼1.20 (±0.01) eV) remained akin to
that of ∼4 nm thick MoS2 layer. The estimated atomic
ratio of molybdenum and sulfur (i.e., Mo/S ratio) for all of the thicknesses
of MoS2 is ∼0.49 (±0.005) (i.e., Mo/S = 1:2.04
(±0.02)), which is very close to the stoichiometric ratio (i.e.,
1:2) of pure MoS2. It substantiates that shells or thin
layers formed on β-TiO2 nanorod arrays were composed
of pure stoichiometric MoS2 only and not of MoS3. Overall, the XPS investigation confirmed successful coating of
MoS2 in the form of shell (∼4 nm) and thin films
of various thicknesses (∼20 and ∼40 nm) over large-area
arrays of 1D β-TiO2 nanorods without any alteration
in the chemical properties of both MoS2 and TiO2.

The FE measurements of
MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods (≡2D
MoS2/1D β-TiO2/Si)
were performed in a planar diode configuration (the emission area
of ∼0.30 cm2) at optimized anode–cathode
separation. Initially, the pristine β-TiO2 nanorods
(≡1D β-TiO2/Si) were subjected to electron
field emission at various separations of 500, 1000, 1500, and 2000
μm. The larger emission current density (i.e., ∼470 μA/cm2), lower threshold field (Ethr) (i.e., 4.8 V/μm), and lowest turn-on field (Eon) (i.e., 3.9 V/μm) were observed at 2000 μm.
A thorough explanation is available elsewhere.12 Likewise, the pristine MoS2 (≡2D MoS2/Si) was also subjected to electron field emission at the
separation of 1000, 1500, and 2000 μm (Figure S5). The larger emission current density of 30.4 μA/cm2 (at 8.4 V/μm) and turn-on field (Eon) of 7.2 V/μm (at 10 μA/cm2)
were achieved for the anode–cathode separation of 1000 μm.
The Eon values reduced from 7.2 to 4.3
V/μm with an increase in the anode–cathode separation
from 1000 to 2000 μm. More detailed explanation of the field
emission behavior of 2D MoS2 is provided in Supporting Information. Owing to the exhibition
of lower Eon for both 2D MoS2/Si and β-TiO2/Si, and delivery of larger emission
current density of β-TiO2/Si emitters at 2000 μm
separation, the FE studies of MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods (MoS2/β-TiO2/Si) were
accomplished at same separation. The FE properties of β-TiO2 nanorods coated with MoS2 of various thicknesses
are shown in Figure 4. The applied electric field (E) dependent variation
in the macroscopic electron emission current density (J) (i.e., J–E plot) of MoS2/β-TiO2/Si, β-TiO2/Si, and
MoS2/Si emitters is shown in Figure 4a. A distinctive variation in the emission
current was observed with the thickness of MoS2. An applied
electric field E (=V/dsep) is in the form of the average field rather than uniform
field between the electrodes separated by the distance dsep. The MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters
deliver larger emission current density at relatively lower applied
fields compared with both β-TiO2/Si and MoS2/Si emitters. Especially, ∼4 nm thick shell of MoS2 on β-TiO2 nanorods yields a larger emission current
density of ∼390 μA/cm2 at an applied field
of 5.5 V/μm. Moreover, the turn-on field (Eon) of β-TiO2/Si (i.e., 3.9 V/μm)
and MoS2/Si (i.e., 4.3 V/μm) emitters essential for
gaining emission current density of 10 μA/cm2 has
been reduced considerably through coating with MoS2 layers
of various thicknesses over β-TiO2 nanorods. The Eon of 2.9, 3.1, and 2.5 V/μm was observed
for ∼40, ∼20, and ∼4 nm thick MoS2 layers/shell, respectively. Similarly, threshold field (Ethr) of β-TiO2/Si emitters
(i.e., 4.8 V/μm) corresponding to the current density of 100
μA/cm2 has been reduced to 3.6, 4.2, and 4.1 V/μm
for respective thickness. The ∼4 nm thick MoS2 shell
on β-TiO2 nanorods gives the lowest values of Eon (i.e., 2.5 V/μm for current density
of 10 μA/cm2) compared with anatase and rutile phases
of various 1D TiO2 nanostructures such as nanotip, nanotubes,
nanorods, nanowires, nanoneedles, nanoflowers, and 3D microspheres.7,12,46,47 In addition, the formation of nanometric layers of MoS2 over β-TiO2 nanorods provided lower Eon compared with pure MoS2 thin films in the
form of protrusions (i.e., 2.8 V/μm)48 and sheets (3.5 V/μm)19 on Si substrate.
Furthermore, our results show much lower values of Eon than those reported for carbon-doped (i.e., 21.9–5.0
V/μm),14 Fe-doped (i.e., 12 V/μm),13 and N-doped (i.e., 10, 9.21, and 6.54 V/μm)
anatase TiO2 nanotubes6 and
the composites of MoS2@TiO223,24 and MoS2@SnO2.21 Moreover, these MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters
appear to be better than the MoS2@TiO2 heterostructure
array delivering Eon of 11 V/μm
at a current density of 10 μA/cm224 and hierarchical MoS2@SnO2 hetero-nanoflowers
delivering Eon of 3.4 V/μm at a
very low current density of 1 μA/cm2.21 However, turn-on fields of 2.2 and 2.5 V/μm
were observed for the composite of MoS2 layers heavily
loaded over rutile TiO2 hierarchical spheres of diameter
>2.5 μm and rutile TiO2 nanoparticles heavily
enclosed
over p-type MoS2 flowerlike spheres of diameter 2 μm.23 However, one cannot neglect that these lower
values of turn-on field were defined at a current density of 1 μA/cm2. Therefore, present 1D β-TiO2 nanorods coated
with ∼4 nm 2D MoS2 were found to be more efficient
for providing low Eon of 2.5 V/μm
at a relatively larger current density of 10 μA/cm2 and also in the quest of field shielding effect because of their
distinct morphological features. These observations are tabulated
(Table ST2) for better presentation of
the novelty of the present work.

and νF is a particular value of the principal Schottky–Nordheim
barrier function ν (correction factor). The emission surface
is treated to be rough for the MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters. Therefore, the ratio of both applied and local electric
fields, which differ from each other at emission sites, is identified
as the field enhancement factor (βFE). A graph of
ln{J/E2} versus (1/E), known as F–N plot, is further
explained from eq 1.
Therefore, the field enhancement factor (βFE) is
determined by the following equation 2  where s (=0.95)
is the value
of the slope correction factor for the Schottky–Nordheim barrier.
However, we considered s = 1, approximately, for
simplicity.

The F–N plots for MoS2-controlled
MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters are shown in Figure 4b. The F–N
plots are
well resolved into two distinct sections. The distinct separations
of F–N plots corroborate the well-defined band alignment of
MoS2 and β-TiO2 after their layer/shell
formation over other. The MoS2 layer/shell over β-TiO2 nanorods has tailored the values of βFE.
The βFE values of 1687, 680, and 1209 and 2465, 1398,
and 6331 are estimated for low-field region and high-field region,
respectively, observed in MoS2/β-TiO2/Si
emitters coated with ∼40, ∼20, and ∼4 nm thick
layers of MoS2, respectively. The values of βFE for MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters
are higher than the values obtained for anatase and rutile phase of
pure TiO2 nanorods and nanotubes,23,47 nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 nanotubes,7 Fe- and N-doped TiO2 nanotubes,6,13 MoS2@TiO2 heterostructures,24 MoS2@SnO2 hetero-nanoflowers,21 nano-heterojunctions of ZnO nanoparticles, and
MoS2 layers over rutile TiO2 nanorods.20,23 Nevertheless, the orthodoxy test utilizing spreadsheet provided
by Forbes in ref (49) was performed to verify the feasibility of the FE measurements of
MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters, especially, field
enhancement factor (βFE). The scaled-barrier-field
(f) values evaluated for MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters coated with ∼40, ∼20, and ∼4
nm thick layers of MoS2 are given in Table 1.

a Single asterisk on fhigh values

The emission situation is orthodox
in all β-TiO2/Si, MoS2/Si, and MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters on the lower (flow) and
higher (fhigh) scaled-barrier-field values.
Although fhigh values for MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters demonstrate an apparently reasonable
emission condition, they are reduced considerably with an increase
in the thickness of MoS2 overlayer. Controlled loading
of MoS2 over 1D β-TiO2 nanorods and well-defined
band alignment between them might have resulted in the enhancement
in FE with larger values of βFE and lower Eon for MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters. Also, the appearance of the sharp morphological feature
of highly conducting MoS2 layers after coating on the top
of nanorods assists in enhancing the local electric field of MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters. Moreover, morphological
features of β-TiO2 nanorods, such as individual dispersion,
vertical alignment, and uniform separation, were maintained after
coating ∼4 nm thick layer/shell of MoS2, which emerged
as improved values of βFE and low Eon. Coating of ∼4 nm thick layer of MoS2 along the β-TiO2 nanorods enhances the conductivity,
and most of the injected electrons are transported easily toward the
emission sites. This reduces the voltage drop along the nanorods and
enhances the effective field at their tips, which leads to the observed
enhancement of FE.

This phenomenon can be further elaborated
by the band alignment
of MoS2/TiO2 shown in Figure 5. The shell material with lower work function
than that of the core material is well considered for the enhancement
of FE. The work function of MoS2 and TiO2 is
4.0 and 4.3 eV,19,47 respectively. Therefore, enhancement
in the FE with better values of β and lower Eon for the MoS2@β-TiO2 was
expected than that of pure β-TiO2 nanorods and pristine
2D MoS2 layer. The formation of this n–n junction
at the interface of MoS2 and β-TiO2 leads
to the favorable band alignment, which can be confirmed by two distinct
sections of F–N plots of MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters. This well-defined band alignment favors tunneling and
transportation of electrons from the conduction band of TiO2 to the conduction band of MoS2. In the case of β-TiO2/Si emitters, at an applied electric field, the electrons
from the conduction band or the state nearest to it contribute for
FE. However, in MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters,
the lower band gap of MoS2 by 1.36 eV than that of TiO250,51 provides relatively large number of electrons,
which were endorsed by electrons tunneled from the conduction band
of TiO2. Consequently, the density of states dramatically
increases and a significant number of electrons from MoS2 layer/shell contribute to the FE. This is the reason why the improvement
in the Eon was observed for the MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters than both pristine 2D
MoS2 and 1D β-TiO2 nanorods. However,
despite large Eon of MoS2 (i.e.,
4.3 V/μm), electron emission is relatively hampered for loading
40 and 20 nm thick layers of MoS2 over β-TiO2 than that for 4 nm thick layers. Enhancement in Eon has been observed after loading 4 nm thick MoS2 layer over β-TiO2 nanorods. Thus, the relatively
lower band gap of MoS2, very thin layer of MoS2 over 1D nanorods, 1D morphology of β-TiO2 nanorods,
and well-defined band alignment collectively contribute to the enhancement
of FE of MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters.

Figure 5 Schematic band
alignment of MoS2-decorated 1D β-TiO2 nanorods.

A stable FE current is one of
the prerequisites for a possible
development of field emitters in a variety of technological applications. Figure 6 shows the FE stability
of MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters and the inset
shows the FE image. The emission current (I) recorded
at a preset current value of 1 μA showed no obvious degradation
for continuous emission up to 180 min (t). Even though
the β-TiO2/Si emitters exhibit good stability (with
slight current fluctuations of ±15% for average current values),12 MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters
rendered comparatively smaller current fluctuations (±10% for
average current values) than that of pure β-TiO2 nanorods,
which confirms the improvement in their stability. Moreover, MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters composed of ∼4
nm MoS2 layer are found to be more stable. The ∼4
nm thick MoS2 layer/shell upholds the nanorods’
morphology of β-TiO2, which serve as emitters in
large numbers, perhaps causing an improvement in the emission quality.

and 4 nm (upper panel) layer/shell of MoS2.

Conclusions
In conclusion, the large-area
arrays of vertically aligned β-TiO2 nanorods on Si
substrate were coated with MoS2 layer/shell utilizing PLD.
The XPS analysis confirmed the formation
of pure stoichiometric MoS2 (i.e., Mo/S = 1:2.04) layers
over the stoichiometric β-TiO2 nanorods (i.e., Ti/O
= 1:1.98). The turn-on field (at a current density of 10 μA/cm2) of 3.9 and 4.3 V/μm exhibited by pristine β-TiO2 nanorods and pure MoS2, respectively, was considerably
reduced further to 2.5 V/μm by coating 4 (±2) nm thick
layer of MoS2 over β-TiO2 nanorods. However,
morphological features of β-TiO2 nanorods, that is,
uniform separation, individual dispersion, and vertical alignment,
and so on lead to acquiring low turn-on field and better FE characteristics.
The ∼4 (±2) nm overlayer of conducting MoS2 along the β-TiO2 nanorods induces most of the injected
electrons to transport easily toward emission sites, which is responsible
for the further enhancement in FE behavior. The heteroarchitecture
of MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods holds the
potential for applications in FE-based nanoelectronic devices, such
as FE flat-panel displays and intense point electron sources in electron
microscopes. Moreover, the present strategy employed to enhance the
FE behavior via rational design of heteroarchitecture structure can
be extended to improve the functionalities of various nanomaterials.

Experimental
Details
Large-area arrays of TiO2 nanorods were
synthesized
on Si substrate utilizing HF-MVD technique. The details of the condensation
of hot titanium vapor onto 1D brookite (β) TiO2 nanorods
are discussed in ref (12). Afterward, the 1D β-TiO2 nanorods arrays were
subjected to the formation of heteroarchitectures in combination with
two-dimensional (2D) MoS2 layers. The MoS2 layers
of various thicknesses were deposited on 1D β-TiO2 nanorods utilizing PLD technique. The pellet of commercial MoS2 powder sintered under argon (Ar) atmosphere at 900 °C
for 12 h was mounted on a rotating target holder, which is fixed at
a distance of ∼5 cm from the substrate holder inside the vacuum
chamber. The large-area array of TiO2 nanorods synthesized
on Si substrate (i.e., TiO2/Si) utilizing HF-MVD was mounted
on the substrate holder facing the MoS2 target. Once the
pressure of the vacuum chamber was pumped down to ∼1 ×
10–4 mbar, the temperature of the TiO2/Si-mounted substrate holder was maintained at ∼450 °C
and the MoS2 layers of various thicknesses were deposited
on TiO2 nanorods utilizing pulsed krypton–fluoride
(KrF) excimer laser of wavelength (λ) 248 nm with 20 ns pulse
at repetition rate of 5 Hz/s and energy density of 1 J/cm2. The MoS2 layer of various thicknesses such as 40 (±3),
20 (±3), and 4 (±2) nm was synthesized on TiO2 nanorods by performing the deposition for various optimized time
durations. After that, the surface morphology of the large-area arrays
of MoS2 coated β-TiO2 nanorods was characterized
using a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM, JEOL JSM-6500F).
The chemical states of MoS2-coated β-TiO2 nanorods were analyzed using X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS,
Thermo Scientific Inc. K-α) with a microfocus monochromated
Al Kα X-ray. The FE studies of MoS2-coated TiO2 nanorods were carried out in a vacuum chamber at a base pressure
of ∼7.5 × 10–9 Torr. The semi-transparent
phosphor screen as an anode was maintained at an optimized distance
of 2000 μm from the specimen/samples of MoS2-coated
β-TiO2 nanorods (i.e., MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters). Further, to avoid the effect of contamination
and loosely bound MoS2 layers/protrusion, preconditioning
of the samples was carried out by applying a voltage of ∼3
kV for 30 min. The FE current (I) was measured with
an electrometer (Keithley 6514) at direct current (dc) voltage (V) applied using high-voltage dc power supply (0–40
kV, Spellman). The long-term stability of the FE current was recorded
for the MoS2/β-TiO2/Si emitters consisting
of 40, 20, and 4 nm thick layer of MoS2.
