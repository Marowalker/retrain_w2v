Carbon dots (CDs) can generate free
radicals in aqueous solutions
which lead to their unique properties and many applications. The main
goal of the current study is to employ CDs as initiators for the polymerization
of the monomer 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane. Efforts have been
recently focused on developing a polymerization process by using a
facile one-step synthesis using HNO3, CDs, and UV light
as initiators. Here, this acidic polymerization process is similarly
carried out by using just UV light and CDs with no other initiator.
The newly synthesized poly(4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane) (PDDM)
was confirmed by several analytical techniques, including X-ray diffraction,
scanning electron microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy,
thermogravimetric analysis, and solid-state NMR spectra. The synthesis
of PDDM was further probed for dye adsorption and it was found that
the polymer well adsorbs methylene blue. Adsorption experiments were
carried out by changing different parameters such as the initial concentration
of methylene blue and the contact time for which the reaction progress
was monitored by UV–visible spectroscopy.

1 Introduction
In the past few decades,
carbon materials have emerged as a new
area of research in catalysis and photocatalysis, solar and photovoltaic
cells, electronic industries, aerospace, and drug delivery and targeting.
Carbon dots (CDs) are a type of nanostructured material composed of
carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, in which all three dimensions span not
more than 10 nm, thus, restricting the mobility of internal electrons
in all directions within the nanoscale dimensions. CDs have several
attractive properties, such as sensitivity,1−3 high chemical
stability,4,5 conductivity,6,7 optical transparency,8,9 high mechanical strength, narrow bandgap, high environmental friendliness,
and strong photoluminescence.10 In addition,
these materials are biodegradable, biocompatible, and nontoxic, and
exhibit multicolor emission and broad excitation spectra, as well
as good colloidal stability5 and high photostability.11,12 For these reasons, CDs have great potential in various chemical
and biomedical applications.1−3 These features impart great versatility
to the CDs and make them particularly attractive in fields such as
optoelectronics,13,14 energy storage, and photocatalysis.15,16 CDs are considered as new materials for the medicinal field as well,
and they were explored for gene transmission, as biosensors and drug
carriers, for biological sensing, and as bio-imaging probes.13,17,18 Considering these numerous applications,
it is worth mentioning that there is no report on the synthesis of
the poly(4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane) (PDDM) polymer by using
CDs as initiators. In the case of the polymerization of aromatic amino
compounds, the use of initiators such as persulfate salts and chloride
salts19−21 is problematic due to their toxicity and strong oxidation.
In the present study, we established a method for the polymerization
of 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM) with the help of CDs and
UV light. Interestingly, CDs prepared from poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
have unpaired electrons on their surface15,22 offering opportunities for polymerization from monomers. In our
case, when the monomers are activated by UV light, the CDs react with
the oxidized amino groups by nitric acid due to the charge attraction
prior to the formation of the polymer.

Moreover, we have applied
the same technique for the synthesis
the polyaniline (PANI) and polypyrrole by using the CDs and UV light.23 This polymerization method works for other polymers
as well for example polyoxydianiline, polydiphenyl diamino sulfone,
and other polymers were prepared by the same technique. The polymerization
employs CDs (plus UV radiation) as initiators which is novel and never
been reported before. As stated above, PDDM has never been synthesized
before. Recently, many reports have addressed the adsorption properties
of polymer-based nanomaterials such as polyaniline (PANI) nanotubes,24 PANI-based silica composite materials,25 pyrrole-based materials,26 nanocrystalline cellulose materials,27 and polydopamine.28 Owing to
the structural similarities between PDDM and these polymers, it is
likely that PDDM can also effectively adsorb methylene blue (MB) and
can be used as an organic component in organic–inorganic composite
adsorbent materials. MB is a frequent representative of other contaminants
found in water sources. In this work, we have revealed that the as-synthesized
polymer can remove MB from an aqueous solution. MB was adsorbed from
an aqueous solution using PDDM as an adsorbent, and these adsorption
experiments were carried out by changing different parameters such
as the initial concentration of MB and the contact time. This adsorption
study was conducted using UV–visible spectroscopy.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Physical Characterization
of CDs
Recently, we reported the formation of ultrafine CDs29 by ultrasonic cavitation in PEG-400. Characterization
of
the products was done by employing various methods. High-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images (Figure 1a) of the CDs show that the
CDs have a spherical shape with a narrow size distribution (∼6
nm). The fluorescence emission of the CDs found in the supernatant
was spread over the 420–610 nm range (Figure 1b) when the excitation wavelengths were between
330 and 490 nm. The d-spacing of CDs was estimated
from the HRTEM and selected area electron diffraction patterns and
was found to be 0.21 nm, in accordance with previous results.11

2.2 Physical and Chemical Characterization
of
PDDM
2.2.1 Fourier-Transform Infrared (FTIR) Study
The FTIR spectra of the 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (DDM)
monomer and the as-synthesized polymer are shown in Figure 2. They confirm the successful
polymerization of the DDM, which has an FTIR spectrum with narrow
peaks at 3448, 3410, and 3323 cm–1 due to asymmetrical
and symmetrical N–H stretching vibration of the aromatic amine.
The peaks at 1628 and 1505 cm–1 are attributed to
the aromatic C=C stretching vibration and the peak at 806 cm–1 is assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibration
mode of N–H. The disappearance of these narrow bands and formation
of a broad band indicate the polymerization of DDM. The PDDM spectrum
displays a broad adsorption peak at 3475 cm–1 which
is due to the N–H stretching vibration mode of the aromatic
amine, and the peak at 2906 cm–1 is assigned to
the aromatic C–H stretching vibration. The peak at 2610 cm–1 is assigned to a methylene C–H stretching
vibration, the bands at 1572 and 1504 cm–1 are attributed
to the C–C ring stretching mode, the band around 1296 cm–1 is assigned to N–H bending, and the peak near
1110 cm–1 is due to the C–H bending vibration
of the benzene ring. The vibrational band around 804 cm–1 is assigned to the out-of-plane bending vibration mode of N–H.
The formation of the polymer is based on these characteristic peaks
of DDM and PDDM, which indicates the successful polymerization of
the DDM.

Figure 2 FTIR spectrum of DDM and the as-synthesized PDDM.

2.2.2 Solid-State NMR (SSNMR)
Analysis
The chemical structure of the PDDM was analyzed
by 13C
SSNMR spectra.23,30 The SSNMR spectra of the monomer
(DDM) and the resulting polymer are exhibited in Figure 3; they provide further support
to the successful polymerization of the DDM. The spectrum depicts
many monomer peaks, a typical structure of a small molecule. On the
other hand, PDDM shows a broad peak between 100 and 150 ppm; here,
all the monomeric peaks have disappeared, and instead a broad peak
characteristic of a polymer is detected. The broad band appears at
128.2 ppm, and is composed of many peaks that are revealed as shoulders.
The two bands marked with an asterisk are spinning side bands.

Figure 3 Solid-state 13C NMR spectra of DDM and as-synthesized
PDDM.

The spectral characteristics are
all attributed to the aromatic
carbons of the PDDM. The spectrum exhibits five broad peaks which
appeared at 124 ppm (shoulder), 40, 125, 130, and 148 ppm. The peak
at 125 ppm and the shoulder peaks at 124 ppm are assigned to carbons
C-3 and C-4, respectively, whereas the two peaks at 148 and 130 ppm
originate from C-1 and C-2, respectively. The peak at 40 ppm is associated
with methane carbon C-5.

2.2.3 X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
Analysis
The X-ray plots of the monomer and the polymer are
shown in Figure 4.
For the monomer,
we observe many crystalline diffraction peaks at 2θ ∼
16.1, 16.8, 17.8, 18.8, 22.7, 24.5, 25.6, and 27°, whereas the
polymer diffractogram has no sharp crystalline peaks; instead, we
observe broad peaks around 23.3 and 43°, which is the evidence
for the formation of a repeated unit of the DDM ring, indicating that
the polymer chain is highly aligned. The broad peak observed at 2θ
∼ 15.7–29.3° is the evidence for the formation
of PDDM of an amorphous nature.

PDDM.

2.2.4 Thermogravimetric
Analysis (TGA)
The TGA thermograms of DDM and PDDM recorded
under a flow of nitrogen
gas are shown in Figure 5. The thermogram of the DDM monomer reveals a 96% single step weight
loss, namely the complete decomposition of the molecule which occurs
at 310 °C. On the other hand, the TGA of the polymer exposes
a three-step weight-loss behavior. The first major weight loss of
8% occurs in the temperature range of 96–160 °C; it is
attributed to the removal of moisture or loss of H2O molecules
from the PDDM. The second major weight loss of around 1% appears at
234–417 °C and is associated with the removal of monomers
and small oligomers. The third major weight loss is 13% at a range
of 450–725 °C, and is assigned to the decomposition of
the polymer. The 36% that remains after the decomposition is a residue
of the polymer or perhaps a carbon residue. The dramatic difference
in the TGA of DDM and PDDM points out the formation of a polymer.

Figure 5 TGA thermograms
of the DDM monomer and the PDDM.

2.2.5 Particle Size Analysis
The morphology
of the PDDM was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
dynamic light scattering (DLS) as depicted in Figure 6a. The surface charge of the polymer was
analyzed by the ζ-potential and found to be +30 mV as shown
in Figure 6b, which
provides evidence that, the surface of the polymer is positively charged.
The SEM image (Figure 6c,d) shows that the polymerization process leads to the formation
of particles. The polymer particles are mostly spherical and some
are irregular spherical with a diameter of 400–1000 nm. The
water dispersion by the particles was analyzed by DLS, which indicated
a diameter smaller than 900 nm. The polymer particles were separated
and washed by centrifugation, which could result in the aggregation
of smaller particles. These aggregates cannot be broken up by sonication
and would therefore dominate light scattering analysis. Indeed, smaller
particles can be detected on the surface of the large particles as
shown in Figure 6c,d.
Therefore, the DLS analysis indicates the size of the aggregates rather
than the individual particles.

and (c, d) SEM image of
the as-synthesized PDDM material.

2.3 Adsorption of MB onto PDDM
The adsorption
of MB by the PDDM powder was followed by UV–visible spectroscopy,
as shown in Figure 7a. The experiments were performed as follows: the addition of 0.04
g of PDDM to a 50 mg/L of MB solution led to a reduction in the absorbance
of MB over time. At time zero, the PDDM material to methylene blue
leads to small changes in the absorption. In comparison, Figure 7b shows only a small
reduction in the absorbance of a similar MB solution (50 mg/L) after
the addition of 0.05 g of commercial PANI, indicating a much lower
adsorption of the dye. Figure 7c shows the concentration profile of MB in the presence of
PDDM. MB was adsorbed almost completely by the PDDM material after
2 h, suggesting that this new polymer could be a good adsorbent for
similar contaminants, and thus be applied for their removal from hazardous
sources.

mL of 50 mg/L solution) with (a) 0.04 g of PDDM material and (b) 0.05
g of commercial polyaniline emeraldine salt (b), and (c) the concentration
profile of the dye as a function of time in the presence of PDDM,
where C0 and C are the
initial and final dye concentrations, respectively.

2.3.1 Adsorption Studies
q is the amount of methylene blue adsorbed per unit mass of PDDM.
The dye removal efficiency (R) was calculated by
using the following eqs 1 and 2 1   2  where, m (g) represents the
mass weight of PDDM and V (L) is the volume of the
methylene blue solution. C0 and Ct (mg/L) are the initial and final concentrations
after the adsorption of methylene blue, respectively.

To study
the adsorption kinetics, 0.04 g of PDDM were added into 10 mL of MB
solution of initial concentration (50 mg/L) in a 100 mL beaker at
25 °C until the system reached an adsorption equilibrium with
different time intervals. The concentration of the MB suspension in
supernatant solutions was used to calculate q at
equilibrium. The effect of the contact time on the adsorption capacity
of MB onto the polymer is shown in Figure 8a, and the removal efficiency of MB with
the contact time is shown in Figure 8b. MB is completely removed from the aqueous solution
in 120 min, as shown in Figure 8b. From this study, we conclude that the PDDM is a good adsorbent
material for the adsorption of the methylene blue dye.

time on (a) adsorption capacity of methylene
blue (MB) onto PDDM, and (b) the efficiency of MB removal (initial
MB concentration of 50 mg/L and adsorbent mass of 0.04 g).

2.3.2 Adsorption Kinetics
Adsorption
kinetic studies were conducted at 25 °C, to afford important
kinetic details on the mechanism and adsorption rate. Figure 9a,b shows the pseudofirst-
and second-order kinetic models for the adsorption of methylene blue
onto PDDM and the kinetic models can be revealed in a linear form
following equations24,28 3   4  where, qt and qe (mg/g) represent the amount of
methylene blue
adsorbed at equilibrium as a function time (min) and k1 (min–1) is the rate constant of the
pseudofirst-order model, whereas k2 (g/(mg
min)) is the pseudosecond-order model rate constant. The kinetic parameters
such as k1, k2, and correlation coefficients as well as calculated qe,cal values are resolved by linear regression, as shown
in Table 1. It can
be easily noted that the qe,cal values
of both kinetic models are almost close to the experimental qe (18.7 mg/g) for PDDM.

2.3.3 Adsorption Isotherm
The adsorption
isotherms are examined as well, as it can easily provide the detailed
information about the surface adsorbent properties and the adsorption
expression. The adsorption equilibrium achieved as the rate of dye
adsorption is equal to the desorption rate. The experimental data
of methylene adsorption onto PDDM matched with the Langmuir isotherm
(Ce/qe vs Ce) and Freundlich (ln qe vs ln Ce) models.
The Langmuir isotherm is based on the inference that adsorption is
localized on a monolayer and all adsorption sites at the adsorbent
are homogeneous.24,28 The Freundlich isotherm assumes
the multilayer adsorption process on a heterogeneous surface. The
linear forms of equations of both models are as follows27 5   6  where, KL (L/mg)
and q0 (mg/g) are the Langmuir constants.
In the case of Freundlich adsorption isotherm, KF and n are the constants. Both isotherms
of PDDM are shown in Figure 10. The values of KL, q0, n, and KF are determined from the isotherms and their values are shown in Table 2. The R2 value of Langmuir is (1) and Freundlich (0.99) model
is very close to 1, expressing the good utilization of both the models
and the monolayer adsorption value calculated from the Langmuir isotherm
model is 19.6 (mg/g), which matches the experimental value (18.7 mg/g).
These results suggest that the adsorption of methylene blue on PDDM
follows isotherm models.

The adsorption feasibility
on PDDM evaluated by the Langmuir isotherm
separation factor (RL) using eq 7 7  where, C0 (mg/L)
is the initial methylene blue concentration and KL (L/mg) is the Langmuir constant. The value of RL illustrates the nature of the isotherm, favorable
(0 < RL < 1), irreversible (RL = 0), unfavorable (RL > 1), and linear (RL = 1).
The RL value of methylene blue adsorption
onto PDDM
is 0.085. This value demonstrates that the methylene blue adsorption
onto PDDM is favorable.

3 Conclusions
The results of present work have shown that poly(4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane)
(PDDM) was successfully synthesized by using HNO3, CDs,
and UV light, without the involvement of any other initiator. The
product identity and its nature were examined by IR, XRD, TGA, and
SEM, and the synthesized polymer was applied in the adsorption of
methylene blue (MB). The results of methylene blue adsorption have
shown that the synthesized polymer has good adsorption capacity compared
with the commercial PANI, which has a similar structure yet shows
much less adsorption of the dye. The adsorption capacity of methylene
blue onto PDDM at 25 °C amounts to 92% removal of the dye in
120 min of contact time. The kinetic mechanism was investigated by
using pseudofirst- and second-order reactions. The Adsorption isotherm
data have been analyzed by using Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm
models. The adsorption capacity of the CD-initiated PDDM polymer is
21.2 mg/g, compared to 5.01 and 5.7 mg/g for the PANI base24 and the PANI/silica composite.25 Thus, PDDM is a good adsorbent material compared to the
PANI base and the PANI/silica composite for the removal of organic
dyes from polluted water.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Poly(ethylene glycol)-400
(PEG-400, 99.98%), DDM, nitric acid, and methylene blue were purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich, Israel.

4.2 Preparation of CDs
PEG-400 (30 mL)
were transferred into a 50 mL beaker which was placed in an oil bath
at 70 °C.23 The tip of an ultrasonic transducer (VCX 750, 20 kHz,
230 V AC, Sonics and Materials Inc.) was dipped in the solution and
sonicated for 180 min with 65% amplitude.

4.3 Synthesis
of PDDM
DDM (1 g) was mixed
in 30 mL of 4 M nitric acid in a 100 mL beaker, to carry out oxidation
at room temperature (RT). To the solution, 3 mL of an aqueous solution
of CDs containing ∼9 mg of the CDs was added and stirred for
10 min. To activate the reaction, the whole solution was placed under
UV light for a week. After the completion of the reaction, 50 mL of
water were added, and the brown precipitate was filtered out and dried
at RT. The yield of the synthesized PDDM was 84 wt %. Control experiments
were carried out in the absence of UV light with CDs as well as using
UV light without CDs, and all the parameters were kept unchanged.
The control reactions did not yield the product. The detailed synthesis
procedure is presented in Scheme 1.

the DDM
4.4 Analytical
Technique
The as-synthesized
PDDM was analyzed by various techniques. FTIR spectra were recorded
using a TENSOR 27 spectrometer (Bruker Inc., Germany). The nature
of the crystalline properties was measured by a Bruker Inc. (Germany)
AXS D8 Advance diffractometer. SEM measurements for determining the
morphology of the PDDM were carried out using an FEI Magellan 400
L microscope. The sample for the SEM measurements was prepared by
placing a small amount of dried powder on a carbon tape attached to
a copper strip and the material was coated with gold to improve the
conductivity. The morphology and crystalline properties of CD nanoparticles
were analyzed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
(HRTEM) using a JEOL 2100 (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA 01960) microscope
that was operated at 200 kV. The samples for HRTEM analysis were prepared
by adding a few drops of CD nanoparticles to 5 mL of isopropanol and
by bath sonication for 2 min. The resulting mixture was dropped on
a silicon-coated copper grid and then dried under vacuum at 25 °C
for 12 h. 13C NMR spectra were acquired using a Bruker
5000 UltraShield spectrometer (Bruker, Billerica, MA). TGA was performed
using a PerkinElmer instrument (Norwalk, CT) in a temperature range
of 25–900 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Dynamic
light scattering (DLS) measurements of the PDDM are performed on a
ZetaSizer Nano-ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Worcestershire, U.K.).
PDDM (1 mg/mL) is dispersed in the water medium.

4.5 Methylene Blue Adsorption Experiment
To make a stock
solution, 50 mg of MB was dissolved in 1000 mL of
distilled water. The concentration was measured by UV–visible
spectroscopy. Twenty milliliters of diluted MB solutions at different
concentrations were added to 0.04 g of PDDM powder, and the suspensions
were stirred at 1200 rpm by a magnetic stirrer for different periods
of time at 25 °C and separated by a syringe (Whatman FP 30/0.45
CA-S 0.45 μm; 7 bar max). The concentrations of MB in the supernatant
solution after different time periods (5–120 min) were measured
using a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Cary 100 spectrophotometer
(Varian), operated by Lab Sphere software).
