We present an investigation of the
photochemistry of aluminum nanoparticles
(Al NPs) capped with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Powder X-ray
diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy with total
attenuated reflection confirm the presence of crystalline aluminum
cores and the PMMA cap and allow us to confirm the latter’s
photodegradation upon exposure to UV light. The PMMA-Al NPs were also
characterized by differential scanning calorimetry coupled with thermogravimetric
analysis to study the thermal profiles for polymer combustion and
metal oxidation exotherms. Transmission electron microscopy confirms
that the Al NPs, around 36 nm in diameter, are embedded in the PMMA
matrix. Following UV irradiation, the PMMA-Al NPs react considerably
faster with alkaline solutions, compared with unphotolyzed samples.
Photoactivation of the nanocomposite induces partial decomposition
of the PMMA capping layer, exposing the underlying reactive metal
cores to the surrounding environment and accelerating its redox reactivity.
Photolysis times of 1, 6, 24, and 52 h were investigated to establish
a minimum UV exposure time for the activation of the PMMA-Al NPs toward
hydrolytic hydrogen gas generation.

==== Body
1 Introduction
There is continuing interest
in the development of aluminum nanoparticles
(Al NPs) owing to their high energy.1,2 Nanostructured
aluminum is also a potential steady and manageable source of hydrogen
gas by virtue of its reaction with aqueous solutions.3 Hydrogen, as an alternative energy source to fossil fuels,
has a higher energy content but lower environmental impact.4−7

Because of the reactive nature of Al NPs, it is necessary
to passivate
and stabilize them upon synthesis. There are many approaches that
can be used to reach this objective based on monolayer assembly or
macromolecular capping methodologies. Examples of the former include
use of acrylics,8 perfluorocarboxylic acids,9−11 or oleic acid in a sonochemically assisted synthesis.12 Network elemental encapsulation by boron or
carbon also provides protective shielding of the underlying Al NP
cores.13−15

There are two general approaches to polymer
capping of Al NPs:
preassembled polymers directly envelope the nascent NPs or the NPs
can themselves serve as scaffolds to polymerize appropriate monomers.
There are a number of reports of the latter, which vary depending
on whether oxide-passivated or oxide-free Al NPs are used. These include
Ziegler–Natta polymerization of ethylene and propylene as well
as di-tert-butyl peroxide-initiated free-radical
polymerization of vinylidene fluoride.16−18 UV light has also been
shown to be an effective polymerization initiator toward the production
of stabilized Al NPs.19 In this instance,
the photopolymerization of methacrylic acid (MAA) was carried out
on the Al NP surface in the presence of a diazonium salt. Instead
of utilizing oxide-passivated Al NPs, the Al NPs were first synthesized
under an inert atmosphere prior to the attachment of the diazonium
salt to the NP surface and subsequent photoinitiation of MAA polymerization.
Liu and Ye demonstrated the ability to graft a layer of poly(trimethylolpropane
triacrylate) onto the surface of commercially produced Al NPs using
AIBN as a free-radical initiator.20 In
a similar fashion, Crouse et al. prepared fluorinated acrylic Al nanocomposites
by AIBN-initiated polymerization of 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyl methacrylate
at the Al NP surface.21

As mentioned
above, stabilization of Al NPs is not solely limited
to the formation of polymers/oligomers at the NP surface; NPs may
also be entrapped within preformed polymer matrices. Li et al. demonstrated
that the nanosized cavities within a Nafion-117 ionomer membrane could
be utilized for NP growth.22 Ghanta et
al. reported on the formation of Al NPs within either poly(vinylpyrrolidone)
or poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) matrices.23

In our laboratory, alkyl-substituted epoxides have been proven
to be effective toward the preparation of air-stable Al NPs.24,25 Hammerstroem et al. demonstrated that the epoxide monomers could
be polymerized onto the surface of the metal core, yielding a monolayer
of polyether loops at the surface of incipient Al NPs in the absence
of a polymerization initiator.26 Varying
degrees of stability ranging from hours to weeks were reported, with
more stable materials resulting from the use of capping monomers with
increasing hydrophobicity. Thomas et al. later showed that alkene-terminated
epoxides were also effective toward NP capping; the additional reactive
functional group was shown to be useful for the grafting of additional
monomers, such as tetradecadiene, leading to the production of Al
NPs that exhibited exceptional air stability (6 months) or the ability
to be dispersed in numerous organic solvents.27,28 This epoxide polymerization methodology has been extended to the
capping and passivation of aluminum, magnesium, zinc, and certain
other d-block metal NPs produced by electrical explosion of wires
(EEW).29−31 This work established that a minimum metal reducing
ability (as quantified by electrode potentials) was necessary to successfully
ring-open and polymerize epoxide monomers.

When our nanocomposite
materials react with a dilute base, they
release hydrogen gas, making them potential hydrogen generating materials
for fuel cell applications. Although Al degradation can be effectively
mitigated in this way, the prophylactic and often hydrophobic capping
polymers used can actually hinder the access to the energy-rich metal
core when required. Thus, our attention has turned to developing environmentally
responsive passivating and capping components that can be readily
degraded upon exposure to a simple physical stimulus such as light
or temperature change.

PMMA has been widely used in engineering
materials because of its
good mechanical and optical properties.32,33 Because of
these unique properties, PMMA is a potential coating agent to prevent
metal corrosion.34,35 Nevertheless, PMMA can be degraded
with exposure to UV light, with main chain scission leading to decreased
elasticity and strength.36 In a preliminary
communication, we carried out experiments which show that PMMA-capped
Al NPs (PMMA-Al NPs) can be activated toward reaction with an aqueous
base following exposure to UV radiation for 52 h.37 This length of time is not ideal, so we decided to investigate
the minimum photolysis time required to effectively degrade the PMMA
cap. We now provide a comprehensive report on the characterization
of PMMA-Al NPs and demonstrate a proof-of-concept study, which confirms
that it is possible to activate organically passivated reactive metal
NPs by exposure to a light stimulus, and thus provide unfettered access
to their full energetic content upon demand.

2 Results
and Discussion
The Al NP metallic cores may themselves be
produced by one of several
different top-down methods, including ball milling,38−40 laser ablation,41−43 plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition,44 and EEW.31,45,46 We have typically used the bottom-up approach of molecular alane
decomposition, initiated by a Ti-based catalyst,47 which in this work is followed by direct addition of a
PMMA solution in toluene to passivate and cap the Al NPs. The presence
of crystalline Al NP cores in the product was determined by powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis (Figure 1). A comparison of the recorded patterns
in the International Center for Diffraction Database (ICDD) crystallographic
database shows five peaks at 2θ = 38.6, 44.8, 65.2, 78.3, and
82.6° corresponding to the lattice planes (111), (200), (220),
(311), and (222) of face-centered cubic aluminum, respectively. After
50 days of air exposure, the five peaks are still clearly present,
though with somewhat diminished intensity.

Figure 1 PXRD of PMMA-Al NP composites
following 0 day and 50 day air exposure.

The peak intensity is not itself a reliable quantitative
guide
to air stability, but using the Scherrer equation, we can determine
crystalline dimensions in both fresh and air-exposed samples. On the
basis of the two most intense peaks (38.6 and 44.8°), which are
expected to have the most accurate peak width determinations, the
average crystallite diameter decreases by about 4 nm from 19 to 15
nm. Compared with previously reported organic capping agents such
as epoxyhexane and epoxydodecane,25,26 PMMA-capped
Al NPs demonstrated significant air stability up to and extending
beyond 50 days.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also
used to provide
some visual information about the PMMA-Al NPs (Figure 2). Figure 2a reveals that the Al cores are embedded in a PMMA
matrix. The darker Al cores can be readily distinguished from the
lighter capping PMMA matrix. Figure 2b suggests formation of spheroidal Al NPs with an average
size of 36 nm and a size distribution estimated to range from about
23 to 45 nm, somewhat larger than that predicted by the Scherrer equation.
This can be attributed to the inclusion of the PMMA capping thickness
in the overall TEM evaluation. Scherrer calculations do not take account
of this amorphous layer around the Al NP crystallite cores. Furthermore,
TEM allows the observation of some degree of NP agglomeration to the
extent that multiple nanoaluminum crystalline cores may be embedded
in a larger PMMA matrix.

Figure 2 TEM images of the PMMA-Al NP nanocomposite material
showing (a)
Al NPs embedded in the PMMA matrix and (b) the spheroidal nature of
the Al NPs.

The PMMA-Al NPs were
characterized by differential scanning calorimetry
coupled with thermogravimetric analysis (DSC/TGA), and the results
are shown in Figure 3. DSC/TGA can further confirm the presence of active aluminum.26,48 The TGA plot reveals ca. 35% decrease in mass by 410 °C. This
decrease corresponds to the first broad exothermic peak from 25 to
410 °C in the DSC trace; together they indicate the degradation
of the PMMA polymer cap primarily through depolymerization.12 The broadness of the DSC exotherm and the wide
temperature range over which mass loss occurs are consistent with
our previous observations with copolymerized epoxide–alkene
aluminum nanocomposites.27 These observations
suggest that up to 60% of the NP mass is composed of Al metal. The
sharp exotherm around 660 °C in the DSC trace represents the
oxidation onset of the aluminum metal cores, which supports the TGA
results, indicating a rapid mass gain, attributable to the formation
of both Al2O3 and AlN (vide infra).12,23,49−51 Thus, the Al
ignition exotherm can clearly be observed, which we have found to
not always be the case with other Al NP systems.

Figure 3 DSC/TGA traces for PMMA-Al
NPs under nitrogen flow.

To have a deeper understanding of this phenomenon, the samples
produced by DSC/TGA analysis were studied using PXRD analysis (Figure 4). It indicates that
the final product comprises both oxygen-depleted aluminum oxide (PDF#
01-078-5519) and aluminum nitride (PDF# 01-080-6097).50,51 Thus, the peaks at 33.3, 36.3, 38.1, 50.0, 59.4, 66.7, and 71.5°
correspond with diffraction from the lattice planes (100), (002),
(101), (102), (110), (103), and (112) of aluminum nitride, respectively.51−54 Meanwhile, the same lattice planes can be assigned to those of oxygen-depleted
alumina with the exception of that at 71.5°, which corresponds
to diffraction from the (200) plane.50,55 The formation
of aluminum nitride is not surprising given that the DSC/TGA protocol
flows nitrogen over the sample during heating. The formation of alumina
can be accounted for by recalling that PMMA contains 13 mol % oxygen,
and this presumably is the oxygen source. Given the limited oxygen
content, formation of oxygen-depleted alumina during combustion is
not altogether surprising either. The mass ratio of aluminum nitride
to aluminum oxide was 56:44 using either the reference intensity ratio
method or the whole power pattern fitting method.

composite following DSC/TGA under nitrogen
flow.

The PMMA-Al NP composite was next
examined for hydrolytic reactivity
as a function of the UV exposure time. Suspensions of the material
in toluene were stirred under an argon flow while irradiated by UV
light from a 450 W mercury lamp for 1, 6, 24, and 52 h. Our preliminary
results suggested that 52 h is sufficient photolysis time to sufficiently
degrade the PMMA-Al NPs but this is a long time to subject our reactive
metal nanocomposite material to UV irradiation, and we wondered if
we could reduce that time to some optimal level that activates the
Al NPs toward hydrolysis sufficiently yet does not degrade the active
Al content significantly. Figure 5 shows the Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
with attenuated total reflection (FTIR-ATR) spectrum of the PMMA-Al
NPs prior to and following UV photolysis for 6 h as well as the FTIR-ATR
spectrum of the neat PMMA polymer. For the neat PMMA and unphotolyzed
PMMA-Al NP samples, the ester carbonyl (C=O) stretching absorption
at ca. 1720 cm–1 and two bands for the C–O stretching frequency at ca. 1140 and
1165 cm–1 are clearly observed, confirming the presence
of the intact PMMA polymer enveloping the Al NPs. However, after 6
h of UV photolysis, the resonances for the ester functionality cannot
be seen, consistent with the photolytic degradation of the polymer.
Additionally, resonances at around 2950, 1530, and 1380 cm–1 corresponding to C–H stretching, C–H scissoring, and
C–H methyl are also observed to be significantly diminished
in the photolyzed sample. Thus, the FTIR-ATR analysis suggests that
6 h is more than sufficient photolysis time to degrade the PMMA cap
and activate the Al NPs toward hydrolysis, although even shorter photolysis
times would be considerably more attractive for optimizing the utility
of such Al nanomaterials for energy applications.

and unphotolyzed PMMA-Al NPs (left
intensity scale) and neat PMMA (right intensity scale).

To further investigate the degradation of PMMA
and reactivity upon
UV irradiation, we carried out a hydrogen emission study to evaluate
the active aluminum content and gauge the rate of hydrolysis as a
function of photolysis time. To allow for batch-to-batch variation,
we divided the product of a single synthesis into two accurately weighed
30–40 mg samples and photolyzed one, while leaving the other
in the dark, prior to hydrolysis and measured the H2 emission
volume as a function of time. We plotted the normalized volume versus
time, and the results are shown in Figure 6.

Figure 6 Normalized H2 emission plots for
unphotolyzed samples
and following UV irradiation of samples for 1, 6, 24, and 52 h. The
measured volumes were averaged over three trial runs for each sample.
Kinetic data are shown in Table 1.

From these plots, we
determined the initial rate of hydrogen production,
d[H2]i/dt,
and the time taken (t1/2) for 50% of the
hydrogen volume to be evolved for each set of samples. The active
aluminum (Al0) content was determined from the gross hydrogen
emission volume based on a H2/Al mole ratio of 3:2 according
to the following reaction and expressed as a percentage of the total
aluminum (oxidized and elemental) content.  The
total aluminum content was determined by the complexometric Zn2+-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt dihydrate
(EDTA) back-titration of the hydrolyzed sample and expressed as mass
percent of the nanocomposite material. Results are given in Table 1.

Unphotolyzed samples were clearly slowest to hydrolyze
with an
initial rate of hydrogen production of 0.3 min–1 and a t1/2 of over 2 min. Our original
work examined only a long photolysis time of 52 h based on the idea
that PMMA is somewhat slow to photochemically degrade under normal
ambient UV exposure. Thus, we were somewhat surprised to see that
the photolysis time as little as 1 h was sufficient to degrade the
organic PMMA capping agent, with samples reacting at twice the rate
(0.6 min–1) and a t1/2 of just under a minute. The highest rate and lowest t1/2 time (3.3 min–1 and 10 s) were essentially
reached after a photolysis time of 6 h, with longer photolysis times
(24 h and our original 52 h) showing no appreciable statistical differences.

Speciation analysis of unphotolyzed PMMA-Al NPs reveals that ca.
50% of the aluminum is present as active Al0, which is
still respectable for an organically capped reactive metal nanocomposite
system but appreciably lower compared to that synthesized in our laboratory
using 1,2-epoxydecene (75–90%), for example.27 However, this is not entirely unsurprising given that PMMA
is significantly more oxygen-rich with ester functionalities that
are likely to be more reactive with electron-rich metal NPs than ether
groups.

It would appear that photolysis times up to 6 h have
little impact
on the active Al0 content, suggesting that photodegradation
of the polymer is taking place without any significant attrition of
the Al NP cores. After 24 h photolysis, it is likely that the compromised
PMMA shell is allowing access to oxidative and solvolytic species,
such as trace O2 and MeOH, a byproduct of PMMA UV degradation,
and thus lowering the active Al0 content below 40%.

The overall mass percent of Al (active plus oxidized) in the nanocomposite
material appears to be little affected until the longest photolysis
time of 52 h. The slight uptick in this value may be attributed to
some degradative mass loss of the PMMA polymer through photoevolution
of volatile and gaseous components (CO, CO2, MeOH).

3 Conclusions
In a mission to develop environmentally-sensitive
reactive metal
nanocomposite materials, we have shown that air-stable Al NPs passivated
and capped with PMMA may be photodegraded and activated by UV irradiation
toward base hydrolysis. An optimal photolysis time of ca. 6 h led
to a maximal hydrolysis rate that was an order of magnitude faster
than that for unphotolyzed samples (as determined by H2 emission experiments) and without significantly compromising active
Al content.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Reagents
and Materials
Alane N,N-dimethylethylamine
complex solution (AlH3·NMe2Et, 0.5 M in
toluene), titanium(IV) isopropoxide
(Ti(OiPr)4, 99.99% trace metal
basis), toluene (anhydrous, 99.8%), PMMA (Mw = 120 000, pellets), zinc sulfate heptahydrate (99.99% trace
metal basis), EDTA (∼99%), sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate
trihydrate, xylenol orange sodium salt, and nitric acid were all purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. Toluene was distilled over sodium metal under
an argon atmosphere to remove trace amounts of water and oxygen. PMMA
(5 × 10–5 M) solution in toluene was subjected
to freeze–pump–thaw cycles several times to remove any
dissolved oxygen.

4.2 Synthesis
The
synthesis protocol
is based on a modification method of the decomposition of AlH3·NMe2Et first reported by Haber and Buhro.47 Because of aluminum air sensitivity, all reactions
were carried out using Schlenk line techniques under an argon atmosphere.
After purging three times with argon, 10 mL of freshly distilled toluene
and 6.5 mL of AlH3·NMe2Et were added to
a clean, dry reaction flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar. The
resulting clear solution was heated to 85 °C. Titanium isopropoxide
(0.8 mL, 3.3 × 10–2 M in toluene) was added,
followed by immediate addition of 5 mL of the PMMA solution (10:1,
Al/PMMA molar ratio). The reaction solution changed from clear to
black-brown. The reaction was heated at 85 °C for 2 h and then
allowed to cool to room temperature. All solvent was removed, and
the resulting gray powder was heated in vacuo at 85 °C overnight.

4.3 PXRD
PXRD measurements were performed
on a Rigaku Miniflex 600 diffractometer equipped with a Cu K(α)
source and a scintillation counter detector. Assignments were confirmed
by comparison with the appropriate pattern from the ICDD Crystallographic
Database, and instrument software was used to carry out Scherrer analysis
to determine crystallite dimensions.

4.4 Thermal
Analysis
The thermal profiles
reported in this work were gathered using a TA Instruments SDT Q600
simultaneous DSC/TGA instrument. The samples were analyzed using a
platinum cup (25–800 °C) under a constant flow rate of
50 mL/min of N2 and a 10 °C/min temperature ramp.

4.5 Electron Microscopy
TEM was used
to gain information on gross NP dimensions and morphology. The images
presented in this work were collected using a JEOL 1200EX TEM operated
at 80 kV and under 200 000× magnification.

4.6 FTIR-ATR Spectroscopy
The infrared
spectra were measured on a Shimadzu model FTIR-8400S spectrometer
equipped with an ATR attachment.

4.7 Ultraviolet
Photolysis
Photochemical
UV equipment was purchased from Ace Glass Inc., consisting of a power
supply, reactor, water cooling condenser, and medium-pressure mercury
lamp. Of the total power radiated by the mercury lamp (450 W), about
40–48% is in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum, whereas
40–43% is in the visible region with a peak wavelength, λmax = 254 nm. The UV apparatus was heated under vacuum for
5 min and purged three times with argon to ensure an oxygen-free environment.

To allow for batch-to-batch compositional variation, we divided
the product of a single synthesis into two accurately weighed 30–40
mg samples and photolyzed one, while leaving the other in the dark.
For the sample to be photolyzed, the PMMA-Al NPs were dispersed in
toluene and stirred while being photolyzed for 1, 6, 24, or 52 h.
To increase the reproducibility and maintain an oxygen-free environment,
argon was flowed continuously during photolysis to sweep away small
organic molecules produced by PMMA degradation. Both photolyzed and
unphotolyzed samples were then hydrolyzed in aqueous 10 M NaOH, and
the hydrogen volume evolved was determined using equipment employed
for the active aluminum analysis and plotted as a function of time.

4.8 Active and Total Al Content Determination
The active and total aluminum contents were determined by previously
reported methods.26,27 The active aluminum content was
determined by the measurement of the hydrogen volume generated from
the reaction of Al NP samples with NaOH (aq). The total Al, oxidized
and unoxidized, content was determined via a complexometric Zn2+–EDTA back-titration.56
