Microbes accumulate heavy metals
after adsorption or absorption. This study exhibited that Trametes versicolor can tolerate up to 5 mg/g concentration
of cadmium. Change in fungus morphology due to cadmium along with
its absorption were analyzed using SEM, XRD, and EDAX. Cadmium absorption
usually increased with time, and it was determined quantitatively
by a fluorimetry technique using a synthesized imine fluorophore as a specific probe and compared with results obtained from atomic
absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The intensity of the cadmium-specific
XRD peak gradually increased up to the seventh day, and the absorption
by the organisms reduced the concentration of cadmium even from the
effluent of the plating industry. After the seventh day, Trametes
versicolor absorbed almost 0.300 mg/g concentration of cadmium
as visualized under high content screening from the fluorescence appearance
of hyphae. Hence it can be concluded that Trametes versicolor may play a key role in reducing cadmium from a contaminated environment.

==== Body
Introduction
Industrial development is one of the major
outcomes of science and technology development; on the other hand,
these kinds of advancements are creating some serious threats not
only to us but to all the living world.1,2 Among these,
endocrine disrupting effects3−5 by heavy metals sometimes mimic
estrogen and alter its activity.6 Some
evidence has shown that cadmium can cause endocrine disruption and
early maturation.7 There are several types
of methods to remove heavy metals mechanically,8−14 but the main problem is either these techniques are expensive or,
to some extent, not sufficiently effective. Generally, microbes can
accumulate heavy metals15−17 on their surface and absorb them
inside their body using channel or carrier proteins. Generally, fungi
are more effective in removal of heavy metals than bacteria because
of their higher biomass.18,19

Trametes
versicolor is a kind of white rot fungus commonly found on
wood.20 Being a laccase producing fungus,
it has various economic benefits, apart from having a huge beneficial
role in nature.21Trametes versicolor can secrete laccase; because of its oxidoreductive nature,22 laccase can oxidize various types of toxic chemical
compounds into nontoxic ones, which is why Trametes versicolor is an important contributor in bioremediation research. Apart from
the reported information, there are so many untold and untouched sides,
which can really give some new methods in the field of environmental
pollution. Usually, Trametes versicolor has a high
growth rate, and due to its huge biomass, it can absorb a large amount
of heavy metals from contaminated sites.21Trametes versicolor can sequester heavy metals
after chelation and either accumulate them inside their body or eject
them using carrier or channel proteins.15,17 Cadmium pollution
has become a very serious environmental problem.23 Using Trametes versicolor, we can respond
to cadmium pollution using their large removal ability.21

There are so many high cost and sophisticated
methods available for cadmium metal ion quantification such as inductively
coupled atomic plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)24 inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES),25 atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS), and anode
stripping voltammetry.26 Recently, fluorescence
spectral analysis has been used as a powerful analytical tool because
of its operational simplicity, cost effectiveness, high sensitivity,
and selectivity.27 For Cd2+ ion
estimation, only a few fluorescence based sensors had reported recently
with different mechanisms.28,29 Among these, only a
very few reports showed a good discrimination for Cd2+ ions
from Zn2+ ions.30 Very recently,
our group has reported a simple fluorescent based chemosensor for
the quantification of Cd2+ ions using a very simple salicyaldimine
based fluorophore [(Z)-2-(4H-1,2,4-triazol-4-yl)iminomethylphenol].
It shows high sensitivity at the femtomolar level and selectivity
toward Cd2+ ions in the presence of Zn2+ ions
at physiological pH based on intramolecular charge transfer (ICT)
mechanism. Moreover, its fluorescence intensity is enhanced in a linear
fashion with variation of the concentration of Cd2+ ions
from 5 fM to 1 mM along with a limit of detection of 1 fM. So, it
could be potentially used for the quantification of Cd2+ ions even if present in femtomolar concentrations. In this work,
we have used the same fluorescent probe (Scheme S1, Supporting Information) based on our reported procedure31 and the same characterization spectra are given
in Supporting Information, Figures S2–S4.

Most papers directly describe cadmium removal after introducing
cadmium stress in laboratory conditions. But this effort tried to
analyze not only overall removal but concentration on absorption.
Other than the ability of significant cadmium removal activity in
laboratory conditions, this study demonstrated cadmium removal ability
of Trametes versicolor from a cadmium contaminated
environmental sample. The synthesized probe, which has been designed
specifically for cadmium, exhibited better identification of cadmium
removal under live cell imaging of treated Trametes versicolor using high content screening, as well as correlated with increasing
emission spectra over time. Compared to previous reports [(76.17%),
(88%), (85%)],32−34 this study demonstrated much higher cadmium removal
(90.3%,). It can be concluded that Trametes versicolor can play a significant role in cadmium removal from contaminated
sites and also that the novel cadmium specific probe can visualize
as well as sense the presence of cadmium after removal using Trametes versicolor.

Experimental Procedures
Materials and Methods
Analytical grade solvents and double distilled water were used
in all steps. Salicyaldehyde, 4-amino-1,2,4-triazole, glacial acetic
acid, HPLC grade ethanol, HNO3, HClO4, KBr,
and resazurin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Glucose, NH4NO3, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4, MgSO4, CuSO4 5H2O, CaCl2, FeSO4, ZnSO4, Na2MoO4, MnSO4, H3BO3, and acetate
salts of different metal ions were purchased from Merck. Yeast extract,
potato dextrose broth, and DMEM media was purchased from Hi-Media.
AGS and MCF-12 cell lines were purchased from NCCS, Pune, and Trametes versicolor was isolated from Pondicherry. 1H NMR and 13C NMR were measured using BrukerAV-400
spectrometer. Mass spectra were measured on a Thermo fleet LC-MS spectrometer.
Measurements were made with a Eutek pH-Tutor.

Growth Condition of Trametes versicolor
Trametes versicolor, a white rot fungus, was isolated from the soil sample of Pondicherry.
During isolation, the fungus has been grown in potato dextrose broth
(PDB) and maintained at 28 °C with shaking at 150 rpm (rotation
per minute) for 7 days. During all experiments the fungus was grown
in Kirk and Ferrell media containing a particular concentration of
cadmium salt and maintained similar growth conditions mentioned above.21

Determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration
(MIC) of Cadmium for Trametes versicolor
Isolated Trametes versicolor(21) grown in separate conical flasks in the presence of various
concentrations of cadmium (0.100 to 6 mg/g) at 28 °C with shaking
at 150 rpm for 15 days to determine minimal inhibitory concentration.
During this experiment, the cadmium source was cadmium acetate. After
15 days, the MIC35 was calculated from
the generated biomass in the presence of different concentrations
of cadmium. The concentration at which no Trametes versicolor growth was observed is considered as MIC value of cadmium. The whole
set of experiments was performed in triplicate. Biomass production
after 15 days of incubation in the presence of different concentrations
of cadmium was statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA to check
whether the statistical significant difference in biomass production
present.

Preparation of Samples from Trametes versicolor for Cadmium Analysis
Trametes versicolor was inoculated in 50 mL of media21 with
1 mg/g concentration of cadmium (Cd) in seven different conical flasks
at 28 °C with shaking at 150 rpm for 7 days. Generally, the growth
of Trametes versicolor will be observed after the
second day. Hence, cadmium-treated biomass was collected every day
from the third day from specifically time labeled conical flask, centrifuged,
dried, and lyophilized. After lyophilization, dried biomass was kept
at normal room temperature in dust free conditions. Before analysis using AAS (PerkinElmer’s PinAAcle 500 was used), 2 mg of lyophilized
treated biomass was dissolved in 8 mL of concentrated nitric acid
along with 2 mL of perchloric acid and kept in a hot air oven at 20 °C
overnight until the solution became clear.

Detection of Cadmium Removal
by Trametes versicolor Using Various Techniques
Fluorimetric
Method
All the UV studies were done with JASCO 550, and fluorescence
spectra titrations were carried out with a CARY Eclipse Fluorescence
spectrophotometer. To 2 mL of synthesized probe at pH 7.0, various
concentrations of cadmium samples were added. The resulting fluorescent
changes were recorded at 433 nm with the excitation wavelength of
332 nm. The same protocol was followed for industrial samples also.
The corresponding color change and UV emission data are given in Supporting Information (Figures S6 and S7).

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)
The clear biomass solution
was used for atomic absorption microscopy analysis, and it was measured
at 283 nm range.21,36 During this experiment, all the
test samples were diluted 70 times, a standard curve was prepared
using 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13 ppm cadmium samples, and concentration
of unknown samples was determined by extrapolating the absorbance
value obtained from third to seventh day samples; after multiplying
by 70, the actual value of removed cadmium was determined. This experiment
was performed in triplicate; increasing biomass with time was analyzed
statistically to determine significant difference using one-way ANOVA.
(PerkinElmer’s PinAAcle 500 were used) The extrapolation data
for complete cadmium removal is given in Supporting Information (Figure S8).

Fourier Transform Infrared
(FT-IR) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
When cadmium is adsorbed
on the surface of the organism, some functional groups play an important
role during adsorption. Functional groups involved in the interaction
with cadmium can be interpreted from the FT-IR data.21 The above lyophilized biomass of the cadmium-treated fungus
was examined through FT-IR (FT-IR-8400S SHIMADZU) using KBr pellet
method. The nature of Trametes versicolor before
and after treatment with cadmium was examined by XRD (PANalytical
X’Pert-Pro MPD PW3040/60 XRD)), and the XRD peak was analyzed
using JCPDS database.

Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)
The uptake
of cadmium was again checked with cyclic voltammetry technique. After
treatment with Trametes versicolor for 15 days of
incubation, the heavy metal sample was filtered through 0.22 μm
syringe filter, and the uptake was checked for the filtrate sample
and control using cyclic voltameter (CHI1205, BIOLOGIC) .

Visualization
of Cadmium up Take by High Content Screening (HCS) Using Synthesized
Probe
The fluorescence probe was added to the freshly grown
fungal biomass (in the presence of cadmium), and after half an hour
of incubation at room temperature, the biomass was spread on a glass
slide using a sterilized needle and forceps. Synthesized probe usually
gives fluorescence when it binds with cadmium after incubation of
fungus. The probe can interact with absorbed or adsorbed cadmium,
and that fluorescence image was visualized using high content screening
(HCS). During visualization under HCS, excitation and emission spectra
at 332 and 436 nm were used. Treated fungus from day 3 through 7 was
ruptured using ultrasonication (methodology explained previously);
after centrifugation, supernatant was passed through a 0.22 μm
syringe filter, and 10 μL of probe was added to 1.5 mL of intracellular
materials before measuring emission spectra at 436 nm. The experiment
was performed three times in triplicate. The mean value of the absorbed
cadmium quantity was statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA.

Detection Using Electron Microscopy of Surface Morphology of Fungus
after Cadmium Adsorption
After the seventh day of incubation,
fungal biomass was collected after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for
15 min. Fungal biomass was separated, spread on an ITO (indium tin
oxide) glass plate, and visualized under scanning electron microscopy
(VEGA3, TESCAN). During imaging under SEM, some specific spots on
the fungal hyphae were examined using EDAX (AMETEK) to confirm the
deposition of cadmium on the fungal surface.

Cytotoxicity Assay of the
Synthesized Probe
To check the cytotoxic effect of the synthesized
probe, AGS and MCF-12F cell lines were used, and resazurin assay was
performed in 96 well plates (5000 cells/well) using DMEM (F12/HAM)
culture media. After 24 h, both cell lines were treated with various
concentrations of the synthesized probe (50–2000 μg/mL)37,38 and incubated for 48 h. Resazurin (1 μM) was added in all
probe treated AGS and MCF-12F cells, and after 4 h of incubation,
the resorufin formation was measured fluorimetrically at 540 nm excitation
and 590 nm emission.

Detection Using Synthesized Probe of Cadmium
Removal by Trametes versicolor from Cadmium Contaminated
Environmental Sample
A cadmium contaminated water sample
was collected from an electroplating industry site in Tamil Nadu.
In individual conical flasks (labeled for collection days), 50 mL
of cadmium-contaminated water sample and uncontaminated water control,
along with yeast extract (5 g/L) and glucose (2 g/L), were inoculated
with Trametes versicolor and incubated for up to
7 days at 28 °C in shaking incubator at 150 rpm. On specified
days, fungal biomass was collected after visible growth in cadmium-contaminated
water and treated with ultrasonication, and the supernatant was collected
after centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min. A portion of 1.5 mL of
the supernatant obtained from each conical flask on a specific day
was mixed with 10 μL of the synthesized probe, and emission
spectra were taken at 436 nm along with specific control. Simultaneously,
the remaining supernatant was lyophilized and prepared using the same
protocol for AAS sample preparation. The amount of cadmium absorbed
in each day was quantified three times in triplicate, and statistical
analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA. Using this experiment,
cadmium absorbed by Trametes versicolor at each time
point from cadmium-contaminated water was both qualitatively and quantitatively
determined.

Results and Discussion
Determination of MIC
Minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined on the basis
of fungal growth in terms of increasing dry biomass after 15 days
of incubation. MIC of cadmium for Trametes versicolor has demonstrated (Figure 1) significant tolerance. Cadmium MIC was 6 mg/g. The cadmium
tolerance by Trametes versicolor was much higher
than the usual concentration of cadmium present in cadmium-polluted
areas, and this MIC value is much greater compared with a previous
report (4 mg/g).39 Increasing concentration
of cadmium gradually decreased the growth of Trametes versicolor as measured by dry biomass with a statistically significant difference
(p < 0.001). This MIC value indicated that Trametes versicolor may play a vital role in the removal
of higher concentrations of cadmium from the cadmium-polluted areas.

of minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the presence of cadmium.

Detection Using the Synthesized
Probe of Cadmium Up Take by Trametes versicolor
Visualization under HCS clearly showed the thread-like appearance
of fungal hyphae (Figure 2a) along with fluorescence due to up take of cadmium (either
adsorption or absorption). When fungus was incubated with probes for
a short time, then probes bound cadmium present on the surface, and
probe was absorbed and combined with absorbed cadmium; as a result,
fluorescence intensity was increased and helped to visualize thread-like
hyphae with its fluorescent appearance. The control sample (fungus
without cadmium) did not show any fluorescence after addition of probes
under HCS.

imaging in the presence of control fungus and probe. (b) Fluorescent
appearance of control fungus/probe/cadmium. (c) Emission spectra for
absorbed cadmium samples on different days.

The quantity of cadmium uptake was confirmed by emission
spectra (Figure 2c)
of samples from different days, and the results clearly showed that
the seventh-day sample showed maximum fluorescence enhancement followed
by samples from sixth, fifth, fourth, and third days, and the concentrations
were 0.365, 0.300, 0.215, 0.162, and 0.110 mg/g, respectively. This
result clearly revealed that cadmium absorption increased with increased
exposure time; as a result, the seventh-day sample exhibited the highest
absorption. These values were correlated with the mean value of cadmium
uptake analyzed using AAS; the results showed that 0.350, 0.290, 0.220,
0.170, and 0.120 mg/g cadmium was absorbed on the seventh, sixth,
fifth, fourth, and third day, respectively, with statistically significant
difference (p < 0.001). The data obtained from
both methods correlating each other indicated that uptake of cadmium
increased with increasing exposure time (Table 1)

Detection Using Probes of Cadmium Absorption by Trametes
versicolor from Cadmium Contaminated Water sample
Contaminated effluent sample analysis clearly reveals that like the
previous result, sample from the seventh day of incubation showed
maximum fluorescence intensity followed by those from the sixth, fifth,
fourth, and third days (Figure 3) because more cadmium was absorbed with increasing time.
Concentrations of cadmium are 0.330, 0.290, 0.210, 0.195, and 0.140
mg/g, respectively. The binding of probe with cadmium was previously
reported as 1:1, which was confirmed via Job’s plot and ESI-mass
and 1H NMR spectroscopy (Figure S5a–c). Simultaneously these results quantitatively analyzed from the
mean value obtained from AAS analysis (Figure S8) revealed that 0.300, 0.270, 0.200, 0.175, and 0.150 mg/g
cadmium was absorbed after 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3 days incubation, respectively,
with statistically significant difference (p <
0.001) (Table 2).

Functional Group Involvement
in Metal Conjugation
The interaction between the control
fungus and cadmium ions were confirmed by the FT-IR analysis, and
the corresponding spectra are shown in Figure 4a. Initially the control exhibited a maximum
stretching frequency at 3353 cm–1, which is due
to the presence of free hydroxyl groups, which may be present in the
fungus. Additionally peaks at 2928, 1644, 1064, and 1378 cm–1 may be attributed to alkyl −CH, amide −C=O
and −C=C– stretching, and −CH3 bending frequencies. From the third day onward cadmium exposed sample
exhibits hydroxyl broadening along with peak shift from 3353 to 3421
cm–1, and only a broadening along with decrease
in intensity was observed for the remaining peaks. Most remarkably
this broadening and peak shift was further enhanced at the seventh
day from 3421 to 3434 cm–1. From these stretching
variations, we could clearly conclude that the cadmium ions can coordinate
with the −OH and amide −C=O and −C=C–
functional groups of the fungus due to the soft acid–soft base
mechanism between cadmium ions and these functional groups.

Figure 4 (a) Detection of the involvement of functional
groups during adsorption. (b) Cadmium accumulation variation detected
using XRD by exposure day.

This mode of interaction was further confirmed with the help of X-ray
diffraction study. Initially for control there was a broad peak observed
at the 2θ value of 25.41 (Figure 4b-1), which indicates the amorphous
nature of the fungus. But for the third day and seventh day, a sharp
peak appeared and increased with time of exposure at the 2θ
value of 44.51 (JCPDS file no. 10-0454)40 (Figure 4b-2,3). This phenomenon signifies that with the
increasing exposure time, accumulation of cadmium also increased,
and cadmium encapsulates the fungus surface. As a result, the amorphous
nature decreases and the crystallinity increases owing to the crystalline
cadmium nanoparticle accumulation.

Conformation of Cadmium Uptake by Cyclic Voltammetry Technique
The concentration of cadmium before and after treatment with Trametes versicolor was analyzed, and a redox couple appeared
corresponding to cadmium with the favorable reduction current of 65
μA and oxidation current of 35 μA in the control sample.
But after treatment, reduction and oxidation current were reduced
to one-third of the original value (Figure 5). The results again confirm the efficient
uptake of cadmium.

Figure 5 Detection of Cadmium Removal using cyclic voltammetry.

Cytotoxicity Assay of the
Synthesized Probe
Resazurin assay clearly indicated that
the highest concentration (2000 μg/mL) of probes did not show
any cytotoxicity against both AGS and MCF-12F cell line (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Cytotoxicity analysis
of synthesized probe: cytotoxicity assay of probe in the presence
of (a) AGS and (b) MCF-12F.

Visualization of Cadmium Up Take Using Electron Microscopy
EDAX along with SEM imaging clearly revealed the presence of cadmium
in the focused hyphae region, and a specific cadmium peak also appeared
after EDAX analysis from that specifically focused region, in other
side control sample (fungus without any cadmium treatment) did not
show any peak corresponding cadmium (Figure 7). SEM images reveal a rod shape with well-defined
cell wall for Trametes versicolor cultured in control
solution. However, SEM images of Trametes versicolor cultured in solution containing cadmium look similar, but cell walls
are not well-defined.

Figure 7 EDAX and SEM images of (a) control fungus without cadmium
treatment and (b) fungus treated with 1000 ppm concentration of cadmium.

Hence, to confirm the status of
cadmium in the fungi, we have done the above analysis using SEM, EDAX,
XRD, and IR spectral analysis.

From the results obtained from
EDAX, it is confirmed that the cadmium is present in the fungal mass. The SEM and XRD results clearly show that the cadmium is
present in the form of nanoparticles. In the SEM, we could not focus
in the nanometer range because the fungi were not stable during close
focusing. But one or two small spots of cadmium nanoparticles were
present, and when the point analysis was carried out on the small
spots in the EDAX analysis, intense peaks corresponding to cadmium
were observed in the EDAX graph.

As per the earlier reports,
more microorganisms and plants can take up metal contaminates from
the soil and water and reduce the metal ions to metal nanoparticles.
For example, recently it was reported that alfalfa plants growing
in a AuCl4 rich environment can take up Au metal ions and
reduced them into nanoparticles. The absorption of Au metal by the
plants was confirmed by X-ray absorption studies (XAS), and transmission
electron microscopy (TEM).41 Similarly,
a well-known example is magnetostatic bacteria, which can synthesize
magnetic nanoparticles.42 The metal-contaminated
waters were treated using live , and the bacteria produced silver–carbon
composite materials. Also, the surface trapping of nanoparticles by
fungus has been reported.43

Conclusion
This study indicated that Trametes versicolor has
a huge potential ability to resist higher concentrations of cadmium.
MIC result showed that Trametes versicolor can resist
5 mg/g cadmium, and it can adhere as well as absorb a huge amount
of cadmium from the environment. In laboratory conditions, we have
seen that Trametes versicolor can absorb 0.100 mg/g
cadmium after the second day of exposure and 0.350 mg/g on the seventh
day. This study clearly revealed that due to absorption of this amount
of cadmium, it can play a significant role in removal or heavy metals
like cadmium from contaminated sites. The synthesized probe was very
specific for cadmium and used for quantitative determination of cadmium
by fluorescent technique. The data obtained from the fluorescent technique
was compared with data obtained from AAS study. XRD, SEM, and CV studies
were also carried out to support the cadmium uptake. The FT-IR study
explains the mechanism of interaction between fungus and cadmium.
In summary, we can conclude that white rot fungus, Trametes
versicolor, can reduce the toxic load of cadmium from industrial
effluent as well as in laboratory conditions efficiently compared
to earlier reports, and the removal can be significant visualized
and quantitatively determined using our probe. As it is an edible
fungus, the removal of cadmium using this fungus can be considered
as a green, simple, and efficient route.
