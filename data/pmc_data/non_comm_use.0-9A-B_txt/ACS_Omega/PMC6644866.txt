In
this work, a series of heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe layered double hydroxide
(LDH) nanocomposites were prepared by a combination of an electrostatic
self-assembly and in situ photoreduction method. In this method, positively
charged p-type Ag3PO4 was electrostatically
bonded to the self-assembled negatively charged surface of the n–n-type
g-C3N4/NiFe (CNLDH) LDH hybrid material with
partial reduction of Ag+ to metallic Ag nanoparticles (NPs)
by the photogenerated electrons and available surface −OH groups
of LDH under visible light irradiation. The presence of Ag3PO4 as a p-type semiconductor, the surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) effect of metallic Ag NPs, and oxygen vacancies as Ov-type defects in NiFe LDH could greatly achieve the quasi-type-II
p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions, which was revealed by
the shifted conduction band and valence band potentials in Mott–Schottky
(M–S) analysis. Among all the optimized heterostructures, CNLDHAgP4
could achieve the highest photocatalytic Cr(VI) reduction rate of
97% and phenol oxidation rate of 90% in 2 h. The heterostructure CNLDHAgP4
photocatalyst possesses a unique morphology consisting of cubic phases
of both Ag NPs and Ag3PO4, which adhered to
the thin and curvy layers of the CNLDH hybrid for smooth electronic
and ionic charge transport. Furthermore, the intimate Schottky barriers
formed at the interface of quasi-type-II p–n/n–n dual
heterojunctions were verified by the photoluminescence, linear sweep
voltammetry, M–S, electrochemical impedance study, high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
studies. The SPR effect of Ag NPs and oxygen vacancies as Ov-type defect in NiFe LDH can effectively accelerate the threshold
of charge separation and be the main reason for the enhanced activity
achieved by the as-fabricated heterostructure photocatalyst.

1 Introduction
Environmental pollution by heavy metals and stable organic effluents
from industrial discharge has awakened the public concern over the
last decade.1 Hexavalent chromium symbolized
as Cr(VI) is a highly toxic and hazardous metal.2 Accordingly, Cr(VI) is one of the major toxic waste metals
associated with many industrial activities such as in leather tanning
industries and chromate manufacturing and mining units, which are
then released into the environment, causing severe contamination in
productive land as well as in aquatic system.3 Alternatively, the toxicity and carcinogenicity of phenolic pollutants
in water bodies have caused serious damage to both human health and
aquatic living organisms.4 The numerous
application of phenol ranges from cosmetics, disinfectant products
to chemical reagents, dyes and artificial resins, and so forth. However,
phenolic compounds are ecotoxic and are also an organic waste discharged
into the aquatic environment by various industries such as pharmaceuticals,
petroleum refineries, food, and paint and dye industries.5 Therefore, an effective and simultaneous removal
of both heavy metal cation Cr(VI) and stable pollutant phenol from
various wastewater resources is of primary importance for saving the
earth. Recently, the photocatalytic reduction and oxidation processes
using the versatile photocatalyst have emerged as the most effective
techniques toward the elimination of Cr(VI) and phenol in aquatic
environments.6,7

Among the developed photocatalytic
materials, n-type NiFe layered
double hydroxide (LDH) can be considered as one of the ideal semiconductor
photocatalysts on account of their low cost, nontoxicity, suitable
redox potential, and excellent optical absorption behavior.8−10 The most inherent properties of the NiFe LDH system is their optical
absorption capability in terms of multiple interelectronic excitation
paths via metal-to-metal charge transfer (MMCT) through oxo-bridged
bimetallic linkages (Ni2+–O–Fe3+), d–d transitions of Ni2+, and ligand-to-metal
charge transfer (LMCT) O → Ni2+/Fe3+ similar
to that in Ni/Zn–Cr LDH.10,11 However, the inherent
relatively low conductivity in terms of carrier efficiency of NiFe
LDH certainly hinders their catalytic performances.12 To achieve a high-performance NiFe LDH-based material,
diverse efforts have been attempted by various scientific groups from
all over the globe to design the NiFe LDH-based heterostructure material.
By the formation of a structurally modulated heterostructure material,
intrinsic surface defects can be created on the surface of LDH, which
can significantly promote the catalytic performances.13 Examples of various works on the NiFe LDH-based heterostructure
material include carbon quantum dots/NiFe LDH,14 carbon nanotube/NiFe LDH,15 graphene/NiFe
LDH,16 NiCo2S4/NiFe
LDH,17 NiCo2O4 nanowire/NiFe
LDH,18 Cu nanowires/NiFe LDH,19 NiFe LDH/molybdate anions,20 and FeOOH/NiFe LDH.21

Our previous work reports that the exfoliated and electrostatic
self-assembled hybrid heterostructures of n–n-type g-C3N4/NiFe LDH (CNLDH) nanocomposites are ideal energy
materials for the photocatalytic water oxidation and reduction reactions
because of a similar layered structure.10 Therefore, it is rational that coupling g-C3N4 with NiFe LDH would result in an eco-friendly material for the mitigation
of environmental pollutants.22 Unfortunately,
fabrication of heterostructures using exfoliated LDH nanosheets is
still a challenge because they are prone to form strong irreversible
agglomerates, which can decrease the photoactive sites as well as
the inaccessibility of the inner surfaces of the resultant materials
for easy charge transport, thus badly affecting the electron-transfer
kinetics.23 Moreover, still the poor stability
of powdered LDH nanosheets further restrains their extensive applications
in photocatalytic fields as in ZnCr LDH/graphene oxide.24

To address these issues and for further
effective charge transport,
one feasible strategy is to incorporate noble metal plasmonic Ag NPs
(nanoparticles abbreviated as NPs) together with Ag3PO4 at the interface of the self-assembled CNLDH hybrid. In particular,
Ag3PO4 is a highly active p-type semiconductor
and possesses a conduction band (CB) located at +0.45 V and a very
deep valence band (VB) located at +2.9 V versus normal hydrogen electrode
(NHE) well aligned for its visible light active photocatalytic oxidation
reactions.25−27 Additionally, the presence of metallic Ag NPs induces
surface plasmon resonance (SPR), in which the collective oscillations
of conductive electrons on the surface of metallic Ag NPs interact
with electromagnetic radiation or offer hot electrons to Ag3PO4 via a plasmonic effect, which can intensify the visible
light absorption capability and consequently improve the catalytic
activity.28−30 Gholami et al. and Xu et al. reported the synthesis
and photocatalytic activity of Ag3VO4/Ag3PO4/Ag and Ag3PO4/AgBr/Ag
plasmonic photocatalysts under visible light.31,32 Among the reported Ag3PO4, modified LDH includes
ortho Ag3PO4/flaky ZnCr LDH composites reported
by Xianlu Cui et al.33 In another report,
Sun et al. prepared Fe3O4@LDH@Ag/Ag3PO4 submicrosphere as a magnetically separable visible
light photocatalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of methylene
blue.34 Recently, our group has reported
Ag@Ag3VO4/ZnCr LDH heterostructure systems toward
photocatalytic water oxidation and phenol degradation reaction.35 However, no reports on the study of the heterostructure
Ag@Ag3PO4/CNLDH nanocomposite as the photocatalyst
and how the SPR electrons of Ag NPs together with Ag3PO4 can participate in effective charge separation and protect
the structural stability of exfoliated NiFe LDH nanosheets in this
system have still been scarcely developed up to now.

Herein,
we report the design and development of a novel plasmonic
heterostructure photocatalyst, namely, Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH (CNLDHAgPx, x = 2, 4, 6, and 8 wt % of Ag3PO4 on 10 wt % of the CNLDH hybrid) fabricated by the combination
of an electrostatic self-assembly and in situ photoreduction method.
In this method, positively charged p-type Ag3PO4 and Ag NPs were electrostatically bonded to the self-assembled negatively
charged surface of the n–n-type CNLDH hybrid material. The
copious amount of surface hydroxyl groups of NiFe LDH and photogenerated
electrons of the heterostructure reduces Ag+ to metallic
Ag NPs. By introducing plasmonic Ag NPs and p-type Ag3PO4 over the electrostatically assembled surface of n–n-type
NiFe LDH/g-C3N4, a quasi-p–n/n–n
dual heterojunction is established in Ag/Ag3PO4@g-C3N4/NiFe LDH for the effective charge separation.
The role of the plasmonic effect of Ag NPs in protecting the stability
of p-type Ag3PO4 as well as the exfoliated NiFe
LDH nanosheets and presence of Ov-type defects (Ov as oxygen vacancies) in NiFe LDH for electron-trapping sites were
well discussed in this study. By this, the heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposite
possesses a strong ability for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
and for the oxidation of phenol to nontoxic products. Furthermore,
the effects of pH solution on the photocatalytic performance were
well investigated in this study.

2 Results
and Discussion
Generally, the photocurrent measurement study
reveals the dynamics
of interfacial charge transfer and separation in a heterostructure
material. Figure 1 represents
the current density versus potential (I–V) measurement plot by using the linear sweep voltammetry
(LSV) study for the as-prepared electrodes (NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH, Ag3PO4, and CNLDHAgPx), under both dark and light illumination (λ ≥
400 nm). In dark, NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and CNLDH
generate a minimum current density in the potential range of −1.5
to +1.2 V. Under light illumination, NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and CNLDH exhibit an anodic photocurrent behavior with photocurrent
densities of +0.0010 μA cm–2, +16.40 μA
cm–2, and +0.0010 mA cm–2 at potentials
of −0.60, −1.13, and −0.96 V, respectively (Figure 1A–C). Figure 1D shows the LSV curve
of Ag3PO4 under dark and light irradiation.
Ag3PO4 shows an incremental cathodic photocurrent
response with the applied bias. The cathodic photocurrent response
of Ag3PO4 reveals its p-type semiconductor property
of the material.38 Ag3PO4 generates a maximum cathodic current density of −0.9
mA cm–2 at −1.5 V. In dark, the current density
of Ag3PO4 was approximately 1.5 times lower
than that of Ag3PO4 under light illumination.
To confirm a dual heterojunction of p–n/n–n type established
among Ag3PO4, g-C3N4,
and NiFe LDH in CNLDHAgPx, LSV measurements of the
heterostructure CNLDHAgPx were taken into account
and shown in Figure 1E. The heterostructure CNLDHAgPx was synthesized
by varying different weight percentage loadings of Ag3PO4 over 10 wt % of the CNLDH hybrid. The weight percentages
of Ag3PO4 to CNLDH were 2, 4, 6, and 8% in the
heterostructure CNLDHAgPx and named as CNLDHAgP2,
CNLDHAgP4, CNLDHAgP6, and CNLDHAgP8, respectively. The photocurrent
measurement study of all the heterostructure materials were carried
out under the exposure of visible light. However, not surprisingly,
the cathodic current density of CNLDHAgPx is significantly
increased at a negative bias of −1.89 V, which signifies its
p-type semiconductor properties. Also, the photocurrent measurements
of all the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx exhibit asymmetric
photocurrent in the reverse and forward direction, which was divided
into two regions, that is, maximum reverse current density (region
I) at negative bias and maximum forward current density (region II)
at positive bias. The photocurrent displayed a marked difference at
the reverse bias region I and forward bias region II. In a conducting
state, CNLDHAgP4 shows the highest current density of −7.90
mA cm–2 at a reverse bias of −1.72 V and
+8.30 mA cm–2 at a forward bias of +1.79 V, which
demonstrates the potential of electrochemical behavior of the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposite. The I–V curve of CNLDHAgPx also exhibits a fine rectifying
behavior of p–n- and n–n-type heterojunctions. The current
can only pass and complete a cycle when p-type Ag3PO4 is positively biased. Therefore, the rectification behavior
is predominantly originated from the formation of p–n heterojunction
interaction between p-type Ag3PO4 and n-type
g-C3N4 in CNLDHAgP4. When an equilibrium was
established during the formation of a junction, electrons in Ag3PO4 were transferred to g-C3N4 because of the SPR effect of Ag NPs and then to NiFe LDH. At the
same time, hole transfer takes place in opposite order from NiFe LDH
to g-C3N4 and then to Ag3PO4 in order to achieve the balance between the electric potential of
a three-component semiconductor in CNLDHAgP4. Finally, when they form
a p–n/n–n dual heterojunction, a built-in potential
difference at the interface will be created. Under forward bias, majority
charge carriers flow freely because of the reduced built-in potential,
resulting in the ON state of the p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions.
However, when the p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions were
reverse-biased, the built-in potential increases, and then the reverse
current was minimal and the junction is in an OFF state. Additionally,
CNLDHAgP2, CNLDHAgP6, and CNLDHAgP8 generate +7.55, +8.04, and +1.33
mA cm–2 n-type currents at forward bias while −7.49,
−7.70, and −3.50 mA cm–2 p-type current
at reverse bias, respectively. Therefore, the photocurrent measurements
concluded that a double heterojunction, that is, p–n and n–n
junction, has been established between the p-type Ag3PO4, n-type g-C3N4, and n-type NiFe LDH.
The decrease in the photocurrent density of CNLDHAgP8 may be due to
the increase wt % loading of Ag3PO4 NPs at the
interfacial area of CNLDH, which leads to photocorrosion, causes instability
of the material, and affects the photocurrent density.38

The crystal phases of all the heterostructure nanocomposites
named
as CNLDHAgP2, CNLDHAgP4, CNLDHAgP6, and CNLDHAgP8 were analyzed through
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurement and compared with NiFe LDH,
g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and CNLDH,
respectively (Figure 2). Generally, pristine LDHs exhibit characteristic intense diffraction
peaks of the (00l) plane because of the high periodicity and favorable
crystallographic orientation along the direction of c-axis, whereas the diffraction peak intensity of other planes is
much reduced. All diffraction patterns of pristine NiFe LDH can be
well indexed into the three-layer 3R polytypic rhombohedral symmetry
of the space group r3̅m with
basal reflections of the (003), (006), and (012) planes referring
to JCPDS card no. 38-0715.39 It has been
well-known that isomorphous substitution of Fe3+ into the
crystal lattice of Ni(OH)2 could replace Ni2+ to form a stable NiFe LDH structure. The development of excess cationic
charge due to the incorporation of Fe3+ was balanced by
the intercalation of various anions inside the interlayer of LDH.10,39 The basal spacings (d) were calculated by using
the Bragg law, nλ = 2d sin(θ),
where n is an integer = 1, λ is the wavelength of the incident
light, and θ is the angle of incidence.40 The d value of NiFe LDH was calculated to be 0.79 nm for NO3– as an intercalating anion. Similarly,
the value of lattice parameter “a”,
which represents the minimum distance between two different types
of cations in the brucite-like layers of NiFe LDH, was estimated to
be ∼0.31 nm. The main characteristic diffraction peak of neat
g-C3N4 appeared at 2θ = 27.3° and
another one with a less intense peak appeared at 2θ = 13.1°,
both of which can be indexed into the (002) and (100) planes of g-C3N4, respectively.10 CNLDH
composites show characteristic peaks of both NiFe LDH and g-C3N4 phases without the interference of crystal growth
of one another.10 The diffraction peaks
of Ag3PO4 matched well with the long-range structural
order body-centered cubic phases of Ag3PO4 (JCPDS
file no. 06-0505) with the space group P4̅3n. Moreover, the high intense peaks of Ag3PO4 suggested its high degree of crystalline nature. By using
the Debye–Scherer formula41 and
from the full width at half-maxima of the (210) diffraction peak of
Ag3PO4, the crystallite sizes of Ag3PO4 in CNLDHAgP2, CNLDHAgP4, CNLDHAgP6, and CNLDHAgP8
were estimated to be ∼5.5, 6.4, 8.4, and 8.8 nm, respectively
(Table S1). This reveals that the size
of the Ag3PO4 nanocrystals in the CNLDHAgPx heterostructure can be controlled by changing the initial
concentration of AgNO3. For CNLDHAgPx,
the peaks located at 2θ values of 20.9, 29.7, 33.3, 36.58, 53.3,
55.0, and 57.3 can be indexed into the (110), (200), (210), (222),
(211), (320), and (321) crystal planes with cubic phases of Ag3PO4 (JCPDS card no. 06-0505).42 The weaker intense peaks found at 38.1, 44.2, and 64.3
corresponding to the (111), (200), and (220) basal planes for metallic
Ag NPs of face-centered cubic symmetry (JCPDS no. 04-0783).42 In sharp contrast, the low diffraction peak
intensity of the (003), (006), (009), and (110) planes of NiFe LDH
with the (002) plane of g-C3N4 gradually decreases,
whereas the diffraction intensity of the (210) and (211) planes of
Ag3PO4 progressively increases in CNLDHAgPx. These results confirmed the lesser periodicity in the
normal direction toward the layered growth of NiFe LDH,43 which is also the first indication of exfoliation
of NiFe LDH, resulting in strong interfacial coupling of Ag3PO4 cubic phase over the electrostatic self-assembled
surface of exfoliated NiFe LDH sheets and g-C3N4. This reflects the synergistic interaction among the most intense
(003) and (006) planes of NiFe LDH, the (002) plane of g-C3N4, and (210) and (211) planes of Ag3PO4 in the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx nanocomposite.
The unit cell directions “a” and “c” of NiFe LDH in CNLDHAgP4 were calculated to be
0.31 and 50 nm, respectively. The changes in lattice parameter “c” reveal the continuous growth and dispersion of
Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 phases over the stacked layer-by-layer
self-assembled structure of positively charged exfoliated NiFe LDH
sheets with negatively charged g-C3N4. The systematic
structural data of the as-synthesized materials are given in Table S1.

Figure 2 XRD patterns of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH,
Ag3PO4, CNLDHAgP2, CNLDHAgP4, CNLDHAgP6, and
CNLDHAgP8.

The formation of the heterostructure
CNLDHAgPx nanocomposite synthesized under visible
light irradiation was further
confirmed from the Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 3). For this, CNLDHAgP4
prepared with and without irradiation was observed to be notably unusual.
The spectra reveal the position of −OH groups at 3375 cm–1 and −C–N and −C=N stretching
vibration modes of CN at 1637 and 1243 cm–1, respectively.
The Fe–O stretching modes of vibrations were found at 776 and
555 cm–1, respectively. The Ni–O and Ni–O–Fe
lattice vibrations were found at around 500–900 cm–1. The comparison of the above-mentioned stretching and lattice vibration
frequencies of both the heterostructures prepared without (Figure 3a) and with irradiation
(Figure 3b) confirms
the existence of phosphate and oxygen functional groups in CNLDHAgP4.
However, in the case of CNLDHAgP4 (prepared with irradiation), the
asymmetric vibration of the P–O peak at 1018 cm–1 is shifted to 1068 cm–1, and in the case of CNLDHAgP4
(prepared without irradiation), the peak is more prominent. The bending
mode of vibrations of the six-membered heterocyclic rings of triazine
units at 808 cm–1 significantly decreased as compared
to the CNLDHAgP4 heterostructure (prepared without irradiation). Again,
in the case of CNLDHAgP4 (prepared with irradiation), a small shoulder
peak at 3621 cm–1 and a prominent peak at 2250 cm–1 suggested the presence of a second type of −OH
stretching vibration of weakly H-bonded to −OH groups of H2O molecules as found in the CeO2/MgAl-LDH work
of the group of authors.44 This observation
shows that a large quantity of phosphate and oxygen functional groups
was present in CNLDHAgP4 (with irradiation) and also confirms the
formation of heterostructures under visible light illumination.

Figure 3 FTIR spectra
of the CNLDHAgP4 heterostructure prepared (a) without
irradiation and (b) with irradiation.

In the morphological study of the catalysts fabricated by
the way
of liquid-state reaction under photoirradiation, the morphology exhibited
a different and unique collection of spherical Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 adhered to the thin and slightly curvy layers of NiFe
LDH and g-C3N4 hybrid materials (Figure 4). In the photoirradiation
method, as CH3OH was used as a polar solvent, there might
be a chance of exfoliation of NiFe LDH and g-C3N4 in this synthetic process and also an equal chance of formation
of metallic Ag NPs with the growth of Ag3PO4. In this way, the reaction was carried out for the growth of the
Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 catalyst over the thin layers
of the self-assembled CNLDH hybrid, and this provides an extra savor
to the morphology in the matter of the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposite.
The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image in Figure 4a–c reveals that the
coherent interface and lamellar morphology of g-C3N4 were beneficial for Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 to grow along the surface of the self-assembled CNLDH nanohybrid
with strong electrostatic bonding interactions. As expected in the
TEM results (Figure 4c), a thin and transparent-like g-C3N4 intimately
dispersed and stabilized over the NiFe LDH matrix without obvious
aggregation. However, in the magnified high-resolution TEM (HRTEM)
image as shown in Figure 4d,e, no lattice fringe of g-C3N4 was
visualized. The lattice spacing of 0.234 nm corresponded to the (111)
crystallographic plane of Ag NPs (JCPDS file no. 01-071-3762), which
is in accordance with the XRD result. The lattice spacings of 0.269
nm and 0.260 could be indexed as the (210) and the (012) crystallographic
plane of Ag3PO4 (JCPDS file no. 06-0505) and
NiFe LDH (JCPDS file no. 38-0715), respectively. Nevertheless, the
energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) elemental spectrum clearly shows the
well-defined spatial distribution of C, N, O, Fe, Ni, Ag, and P elements
(Figure 4g), which
indicate the homogeneous distribution of the Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 over the interfacial area of the CNLDH hybrid for
recuperating the surface redox reactions. The tight adhesion between
the Ag3PO4, Ag NPs, g-C3N4, and NiFe LDHs would greatly favor the interfacial charge transfer
and promote the photocatalytic activities. In sum, TEM and HRTEM results
confirmed that Ag NPs and Ag3PO4 were successfully
formed over the surface of the CNLDH hybrid after in situ liquid-state
reaction under visible light irradiation. The interfaces between the
lattice fringes of Ag, Ag3PO4, and NiFe LDH
were clearly distinguished in the HRTEM image (Figure 4e), which indicated the formation of heterostructures
and promoted the efficiency of electron transfer within the heterojunction
nanocomposite. Furthermore, the crystallinity of the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4 was confirmed by the selected area electron diffraction
(SAED) pattern (Figure 4f). The ring patterns in the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 correspond
to the (210) and (012) crystallographic planes of Ag3PO4 and NiFe LDH, respectively.

and (g) EDX spectra of the CNLDHAgP4 sample.

In the growth process of the designed p–n/n–n
dual
heterojunctions, an improved in situ deposition photoreduction synthetic
route is used to deposit Ag NPs and p-type Ag3PO4 over the self-assembled surface of n-type g-C3N4/n-type NiFe LDH. Finally, the plasmonic heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposite
is obtained by the photoreduction of Ag+ by the photogenerated
electrons on the surfaces of p-type Ag3PO4 using
the AgNO3 precursor. In the presence of methanol, which
acts as a dispersing as well as a reducing agent, Ag+ ions
get attached onto the negatively charged surface of the CNLDH hybrid
and partially get reduced. Initially, Ag2O was precipitated
from the solution of AgNO3 because of copiously available
surface −OH groups of LDH. However, the obtained brown colored
precipitate dissolves in excess of (NH4)2HPO4 precursor to form an [Ag (NH3)2]+ complex, which releases Ag+ ions into the solution
(Ag+/Ag = 0.7996 V and Ag2O/Ag+OH– = 0.342 V vsNHE, pH = 0).35 The chemical reaction between these species in solution under visible
light irradiation results in the formation of Ag NPs and Ag3PO4. The whole reduction process is depicted by the following
equations: 1   2  

The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
technique is used to
confirm the surface chemical composition and electronic environment
of elements present in the as-synthesized materials. Figure S1 shows the survey scan of CNLDH and the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4. The signals of Ni, Fe, Ag, N, P, O, and C were detected
in the survey XPS spectrum, confirming the formation of heterostructures.
The erratic oxidation state of all the elements present in the material
was further analyzed by the deconvolution of the high-resolution XPS
peak of each element using the help of CASAXPS and Origin software.
This deconvolution provides sufficient evidence about the interaction
among the constituent components present in the heterostructure. For
the Ni 2p spectrum, Ni 2p3/2 and Ni 2p1/2 peaks
at 856.0 and 873.8 eV were fitted with two spin–orbit doublets,
followed by two prominent shake-up satellites at 856.0 and 873.8,
which are characteristic of high-spin Ni2+ state and manifested
as Ni(OH)2 in CNLDHAgP4 (Figure 5a).45 In sharp
contrast, the Fe 2p spectrum (Figure 5b) shows two prominent peaks located at 712.9 and 725.9
eV, which are assigned to Fe 2p3/2 and Fe 2p1/2, respectively.45 The high-resolution
O 1s spectra of CNLDHAgP4 (Figure 5c) reveal four distinct peaks attributed to the surface
hydroxyl groups attached to metal center-O1 (531.5 eV),46 lattice oxygen-O2 (530.5 eV),47 under coordinated lattice oxygen related to oxygen vacancies-O3
(531.6 eV),48 and absorbed water-O4 (532.8),49 respectively. Moreover, the N 1s wide peak of
CNLDHAgP4 (Figure 5d) could be fitted into three peaks and interpreted as (I) sp2 N present in triazine ring units corresponding to the C–N=C
group and is a vital part of sp2-bonded graphitic carbon
nitride (398.3 eV),50 (II) N–(C)3 as bridged nitrogen atoms (399.8 eV),50 and (III) the presence of chemisorbed nitrogen species
as NH4+ ions (403.4 eV),51 respectively.

CNLDHAgP4 for (a) Ni 2p, (b) Fe 2p, (c) O 1s, and (d) N 1s.

The high-resolution Ag 3d XPS
spectrum of Ag3PO4 present in CNLDHAgP4 (Figure 6a) consists of Ag
3d5/2 and Ag 3d3/2 states, which could be divided
into four characteristic peaks, of
which the first two peaks at 368.0 and 367.4 eV are assigned to Ag
3d5/2 and the other two peaks at 373.8 and 374.2 eV are
assigned to Ag 3d3/2, respectively.38,52−54 The peaks at 374.2 and 368.0 eV can be attributed
to the Ag0 species, whereas the peaks at 373.8 and 367.4
eV can be attributed to the Ag+ ions of Ag3PO4 in CNLDHAgP4.52,53 The photocatalytic activity is
not affected to a greater extent because of slight increment of the
metallic Ag NP content in the material. To further prove the presence
of metallic Ag NPs in the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4, the XPS analysis
of the peak of the Ag region was taken into account. The relative
concentration of metallic Ag NPs was estimated to be 46% by analyzing
the deconvoluted areas of both Ag+ and Ag0 peaks
in the XPS spectra of the Ag region using the following equation: 3  

Figure 6 Deconvoluted XPS spectra of CNLDHAgP4 for (a) Ag 3d, (b)
P 2p,
and (c) C 1s.

The binding energy (BE)
of P 2p is determined to be 134.6 eV, corresponding
to P+5 in Ag3PO4 (Figure 6b). The deconvoluted C 1s XPS
spectrum (Figure 6c)
corresponds to the C–C (284.9 eV), C–O (286 eV), C–N
(287.6 eV), and O–C=O (288.9 eV) linkages,50 which validate the existence of g-C3N4 in CNLDHAgP4.

To further confirm the electron
transfer from Ag3PO4 to NiFe LDH, the chemical
states and positions of the BE
region of Ni 2p, Fe 2p, N 1s, and O 1s in CNLDH were examined by XPS
(Figure 5a–d). These results indicated the negative shift,
that is, (∼0.6, 0.3 eV), of BE positions of Ni and N in CNLDHAgP4
as compared to that of CNLDH,10 whereas
a positive shift, that is, (∼0.8, 0.1 eV), of BE of Fe 2p and
O 1s was noticed in comparison to that of CNLDH. Furthermore, the
peak of oxygen vacancies (O3) remains more prominent in CNLDHAgP4,
which proves the presence of oxygen vacancy-type defects (Ov) induced because of exfoliation of NiFe LDH during the fabrication
process of CNLDHAgP4. Similarly, from Figure 6a, the Ag 3d peaks
in CNLDHAgP4 shifted positively ∼0.4 eV as compared to the
reported values of Ag peaks in Ag3PO4 (367.2
and 373.1 eV).54 The shifting in the BE
peaks of Ni, Fe, Ag, N, and O in CNLDHAgP4 demonstrates the strong
interaction and migration of the electron cloud from p-type Ag3PO4 to n-type g-C3N4 and
finally to n-type NiFe LDH, which facilitate the formation of dual
interfaces in the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4.

UV–visible
diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (UV–vis
DRS) was used to assess the photoabsorptive behaviors of the studied
photocatalyst (Figure 7). Bare NiFe LDH shows absorption bands in both the UV and visible
regions, where absorption bands were located within 200–300,
300–600, and 600–800 nm. The intrinsic absorption band
within 200–300 nm in the UV region could be assigned to the
LMCT from the O 2p → Ni 3dt2g orbital, while the
bands within 300–800 nm corresponded to d–d transitions
and are characteristic geometry of Ni2+ ions in an octahedral
field.55,56 Another intense absorption band found within
520 nm was due to the transition of Ni2+–O–Fe3+ to Ni+–O–Fe4+, originating
from the induced MMCT for the oxo-bridged bimetallic linkage. These
MMCT absorption bands most likely originated from the crystal field
splitting of the oxo-bridged bimetallic LDH system.10,57 The absorption bands located at 380 and 740 nm corresponded to spin-allowed
transitions of 3A2g(F) → 3T1g(P) and
3A2g(F) → 3T1g(F), which result from
the characteristic d8 configuration geometry of Ni2+ ions in an octahedral field. Likewise, the bands located
at 420 and 645 nm corresponded to spin-forbidden transitions 3A2g(F) → 1T2g(D) and 3A2g(F) →
1Eg(D), respectively.58 Neat
g-C3N4 displays a strong absorption band edge
at 460 nm, which is attributed to the n−π* transitions
related to the involvement of lone pairs on the edge of N atoms of
the triazine/heptazine ring units and corresponds to the band gap
energy value of ca. 2.7 eV.10,28 The CNLDH composite
material exhibits a blue-shift absorption edge at 441 nm, which is
due to the quantum confinement effect of CN over LDH with the absorption
band covering a wider visible region.10,59 The spectral
behavior of Ag3PO4 indicated that it can absorb
solar light corresponding to a band gap energy of 2.43 eV, which utilizes
the efficiency of solar light and consequently enhances the photocatalytic
activity.38,54 In the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx nanocomposite, incorporation of Ag3PO4 to
the CNLDH hybrid can significantly affect their optical properties
with enhanced absorption intensity covering a wider visible region.
Notably, four absorption edges can be detected in the spectral curves
of the CNLDHAgPx material, for example, in CNLDHAgP4,
at 460, 560, 620, and 650 nm (Figure 7). The absorption edges at 460 and 560 nm were assigned
to g-C3N4 and the SPR effect of plasmonic Ag
NPs (inset of Figure 7), respectively.10,60 The SPR absorption peak was dominated
over the absorption peak of Ag3PO4 and MMCT
absorption edges of LDH and showed a broad shoulder band at 500–600
nm, which was due to the narrowing of the band gap. Clearly, the absorption
edges at 620 and 650 are due to the d–d transition of Ni2+ of NiFe LDH in CNLDHAgP4. Overall, the enhanced absorption
intensity of the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 could be ascribed to the
dominant plasmonic effect of Ag NPs,48 during
the growth of Ag3PO4 over the electrostatic
self-assembled surface of CNLDH.47 The
phenomenon was in well agreement with the color of the samples, which
changed from pale yellow to deep yellow and then to pale brown with
the content of Ag3PO4. The optical studies strongly
confirm the synergism charge transfer between Ag NPs, Ag3PO4, g-C3N4, and NiFe LDH.

and CNLDHAgP8.

The band gap energies
(Eg) of a semiconductor
material were calculated by fitting the absorption data with Kubelka–Munk
absorbance and Tauc’s plot via the following equation: 4  where α is the absorption coefficient, h is
the Planck constant, ν is the energy of incident
lights, A is an arbitrary constant, and Eg is the band gap energy of a semiconductor material.
In Tauc’s expression, the value of n signifies the kind of
optical transition of a semiconductor (n = 1/2 for
direct transition and n = 2 for indirect transition).10,35,44,56 The values of Eg for different materials
were determined by extrapolating the linear portion of the (αhν)1/2 curve versus photon energy hν. From Figure 8, the Eg values of NiFe
LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH, Ag3PO4, and CNLDHAgP4 were calculated to be 2.20, 2.70, 2.35, 2.43, and
2.38 eV, respectively. The most interesting finding in optical studies
is the red shifting of absorption band from 500 to 800 nm in all the
as-synthesized heterostructure CNLDHAgPx, which could
be especially due to the dominant SPR effect of metallic Ag NPs along
with the added contribution of d–d transition of Ni2+, MMCT (MII–O–MIII), and LMCT
of NiFe LDH.

2.1 Photocatalytic Reduction and Oxidation Potential
of the Catalyst
2.1.1 Assessment of Cr(VI)
Reduction Potential
The photocatalytic activities of NiFe
LDH, CN, CNLDH, and heterostructure
CNLDHAgPx were measured for the reduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III) in an aqueous solution of K2Cr2O7 under solar light exposure (Figure 9). A blank experiment without a photocatalyst
or sunlight was also performed to verify the concentration of Cr(VI),
and the results were found to remain constant, which reflects the
insignificant photolysis and relatively stable content of K2Cr2O7. Before being exposed to light, the Cr(VI)
solution was stirred in the dark at about 30 min to ensure the establishment
of an adsorption–desorption equilibrium between the photocatalyst
and the Cr(VI) solution. As shown in Figure 9a, the adsorption rates were found to be
5.5% (Ag3PO4), 7% (g-C3N4), 10.0% (NiFe LDH), 12.0% (CNLDH), 15.5% (CNLDHAgP2), 25.8% (CNLDHAgP4),
18.0% (CNLDHAgP6), and 12.2% (CNLDHAgP8), respectively. After the
exposure of sunlight for 120 min (Figure 9a), there was apparent decrease in the concentration
of Cr(VI) for pristine NiFe LDH (45%), g-C3N4 (38%), Ag3PO4 (20%), and CNLDH (65%). However,
the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx possesses enhanced
Cr(VI) reduction activities. Thus, the modification of Ag3PO4 together with plasmonic Ag NPs dispersed over the
CNLDH hybrid was an advantage for the photocatalytic reduction of
Cr(VI). The Cr(VI) reduction activities of various CNLDHAgPx samples follow the order as CNLDHAgP8 (70%) < CNLDHAgP2
(78%) < CNLDHAgP6 (84%) < CNLDHAgP4 (97%). On the basis of the
erratic results of the samples corresponding to reaction times of
Cr(VI) reduction over a period of time, many factors such as size,
morphology, electronic, electrochemical, and interfacial charge transfer
should be accountable for the photocatalytic activity. Therefore,
it can be believed that the heterojunction interaction between Ag
NPs, Ag3PO4, g-C3N4, and
NiFe LDH plays a major role in the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI)
to Cr(III). In fact, the dominant SPR effect of Ag NPs together with
Ag3PO4 extends the visible light reaction, and
the availability of electrons contributes a lot to a higher Cr(VI)
reduction. Furthermore, a large quantity of Ag3PO4 on the surface of CNLDHAgPx may hinder the light
penetration in the materials and may confine interfacial charge transfer
between NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and Ag3PO4, which limit the contraction of Cr(VI). Therefore,
high content of Ag3PO4 in CNLDHAgPx cannot exhibit high photocatalytic activity. This is because in
the case of CNLDHAgP8, Ag3PO4 might act as a
recombination center for photogenerated electron–hole pairs.61 The lowest photoluminescence (PL) intensity,
largest photocurrent density, and reduced arc in the Nyquist plot
also supported that the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 is the best photocatalyst
in this finding. The spectral changes of absorbance during Cr(VI)
removal using different catalysts were examined at different intervals
of time and are shown in Figure 9b. Typically, in the presence of the CNLDHAgP4 catalyst
and under solar light, the intensity of the absorption peak at λmax = 540 for Cr(VI) in the UV–vis nanometer slowly
flattened at a time period of 120 min. This can also be monitored
by visualizing the color of the analyte solution, which slowly changes
from yellow color to transparent because of reduction of Cr(VI) to
Cr(III).7

kinetic plot of Cr(VI) reduction over CNLDHAgP4, and (d) spectral
absorption changes during Cr(VI) reduction over CNLDHAgP4 at different
pHs.

2.1.2 Kinetics
of the Cr(VI) Reduction Potential
To evaluate the kinetics
of Cr(VI), the zero-order (eq 4), first-order (eq 5), and second-order models (eq 6) were used to analyze
the experimental data and the fitting results. The rate constants
(k), average relative errors, and coefficient of
determinations (R2) for kinetics of Cr(VI)
were tabulated in Table 1. 5   6   7

standard error	0.064	0.179	0.074	0.325	0.0038	0.0056	0.090	0.1352	
The reaction is best fitted for the second-order relationship
1/Ct = 1/C0 + k2 × t, where C0 is the initial concentration
of the solution, t is the reaction time, and Ct is the solution concentration
at reaction time t. The kinetics of Cr(VI) reduction
plots for different samples are shown in Figure 9c. The rate constants of the reaction were
obtained by the polynomial fitting and entered in Table 1. The rate constant (k2) of the reaction rate of CNLDHAgP4 (0.05049
L/mg min) was 1.85-fold to that of CNLDH (0.02742 L/mg min), 4.16-fold
to that of g-C3N4 (0.01253 L/mg min), 3.84-fold
to that of NiFe LDH (0.01363 L/mg min), and 4.54-fold to that of Ag3PO4 (0.01164 L/mg min), which indicates an increased
rate of photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI) over the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4.

2.1.3 Effect of pH on the Photocatalytic
Reduction
of Cr(VI)
The pH of a solution plays a crucial role in the
adsorption and reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Generally,
the Cr(VI) reduction process decreases at higher pH because of the
negatively charged surface of the photocatalyst, which repels the
Cr2O72– anions. At lower pH,
the surface of a photocatalyst becomes positively charged because
of the availability of protons and tends to attract Cr2O72– anions, which facilitates the adsorption
process. To study these effects, a series of experiments were performed
at different pHs ranging from 5 to 8, and the results are shown in Figure 9d. The highest reduction
rate of Cr(VI) was possible under an acidic pH 5. At higher pH, the
redox reaction was carried out in the solution, which inhibits the
reduction of Cr(VI).62 Furthermore, with
the increment of pH, there is a chance that the soluble metal cations
(i.e., Ni2+, Fe3+, and Cr3+) would
be removed away from the solution by forming Ni(OH)2 (Ksp of 5.5 × 10–16) and
Fe(OH)3 (Ksp of 2.79 ×
10–39).62 Alternatively,
in very strong acidic or basic conditions, the dissolution of oxygen-containing
functional groups of the NiFe LDH phase present in the heterostructure
would be possible and decrease the adsorption process as well as the
rate of reduction. Therefore, the suitable pH, that is, 5, was effective
for the reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4. Hence, the removal of Cr(VI) in CNLDHAgP4 was achieved
at a suitable pH of 5 with the availability of protons in the solution
and electrons at the CB of NiFe LDH because of the SPR effect of Ag
NPs and interfacial charge transfer by the formation of quasi-type-II
dual heterojunctions. The reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III)
follows the following equation: 8  

2.1.4 Effect of Scavengers on the Reduction of
Cr(VI)
Generally, it is known that the CB electrons of a
photocatalyst play a vital role during the reduction of Cr(VI) to
Cr(III). To prove the active role of electrons, CH3OH was
used as a hole scavenger during the Cr(VI) reduction process, which
then consumed the photogenerated holes in the VB of the photocatalyst
so that the reduction percentage of Cr(VI) was significantly enhanced.
A typical experimental method involves addition of different quantities
of CH3OH and citric acid to a specific parts per million
concentration of Cr(VI) solution maintaining pH 5. As shown in Figure S2a, the addition of CH3OH
(2 mL) decreases the photoreduction time together with increase in
the percentage of Cr(VI) reduction. Furthermore, aqueous citric acid
solution (1 mL, 5 mM) was also used for the complete reduction of
Cr(VI) within 80 min. When a mixed solution containing both CH3OH (2 mL) and citric acid (1 mL) was added to the parts per
million concentration of aqueous Cr(VI) solution, then complete reduction
was found in 60 min. This suggests that the electron is the major
active species for the reduction of Cr(VI). For strong support of
the participation of electrons, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, 4 mM) and
AgNO3 (0.4 mM) as electron scavengers were added to the
reaction medium. However, the rate of photoreduction of Cr(VI) was
negligible by the addition of both DMSO and AgNO3. Consequently,
the Cr(VI) photoreduction mechanism proceeded with a direct one-step
reduction reaction by photogenerated electrons in the presence of
both CH3OH and citric acid. Also, Fu et al. reported the
mechanism of the photocatalytic reduction of Cr(VI), proposing that
Cr(VI) captures the photoexcited CB electrons for the reduction process
and that H2O gets adsorbed by the VB holes.63

2.1.5 Photocatalytic Oxidation
of Phenol
The versatile photocatalytic activities of the
heterostructure CNLDHAgPx nanocomposites were also
evaluated for the oxidation of
phenol as the model organic contaminant under direct natural solar
light irradiation. The effect of different pHs over phenol oxidation
was also examined, and afterward pH 7 was found to be optimum pH for
the oxidation of phenol. The efficiency of oxidation percentage was
found to increase at acidic pH, whereas the degradation efficiency
was found to decrease at basic pH. In very strong basic and acidic
solutions, the oxygen functional groups of NiFe LDH in the heterostructure
CNLDHAgPx would be dissolved and quite unstable.
Therefore, the catalyst has a tendency to lose its activity, and consequently,
the degradation efficiency was hampered. The highest efficiency for
phenol degradation under solar light irradiation was found to be at
pH 7 at the time interval of 120 min. The sequence of degradation
activity in different pH studies follows the order: pH 7 > pH 6
>
pH 8 > pH 4 > pH 11 (Figure 10a). In the absence of both the photocatalyst and solar
light,
a negligible amount of oxidation was noticed, which also shows the
stability of organic pollutant phenol and sensitivity of the photocatalyst
toward light. However, about 90% of phenol oxidation was achieved
in 2 h under direct solar light irradiation. The photocatalytic oxidation
ability of the as-prepared catalysts follows the order: CNLDHAgP4
(90%) > CNLDHAgP6 (85%) > CNLDHAgP2 (80%) > CNLDHAgP8 (75%)
> CNLDH
(51%) > Ag3PO4 (50%) > NiFe LDH (37%)
> g-C3N4 (27%). Figure 10b displays the variation in UV–vis
absorption
spectral curves of phenol oxidation. Phenol exhibits an absorption
peak at λmax of 269.5 nm, which was found to fade
away gradually with the increase in exposure time of natural sunlight.
Generally, the phenol oxidation reactions were preceded with the absorbance
peak at 269.5 nm, which first slightly faded without the shifting
in absorption band. Afterward, the absorption peaks of some intermediate
aromatic species such as catechol (278–280 nm) and p-benzoquinone (p-BQ) (249 nm) simultaneously
appeared and then finally converted to CO2 and H2O.35 The reduction reaction of Cr(VI)
and phenol oxidation activities clearly reveal the importance of Ag3PO4 (4%) as the optimum loading in CNLDHAgP4. The
synergistic interaction among Ag NPs, Ag3PO4, g-C3N4, and NiFe LDH was mainly accountable
for the larger photocatalytic accomplishment of CNLDHAgP4. Furthermore,
the superior photocatalytic performance of CNLDHAgP4 was also attributed
to some fundamental reasons of light absorption and effective charge
separation by the subsequent points as (i) the dominant SPR effect
of metallic Ag NPs over the oxo-bridge bimetallic linkages in NiFe
LDH was responsible for the enhanced absorption of light in CNLDHAgP4
(from the UV–vis DRS study), (iii) Ov-type defect
as oxygen vacancies in NiFe LDH acts as trapping sites for electrons
and suppressed the charge recombination (from the XPS and PL study),
and (iv) effective charge separation because of the establishment
of a quasi-type II p–n/n–n dual heterojunction between
Ag3PO4, g-C3N4, and NiFe
LDH (from the electrochemical study).

spectral changes during the oxidation of phenol over CNLDHAgP4 at
different intervals of time, and (c) pseudo-first-order kinetics,
followed by the oxidation of phenol over CNLDHAgP4.

2.1.6 Kinetics of Photocatalytic
Phenol Oxidation
The phenol oxidation kinetics of all the
as-prepared catalyst was
analyzed by a UV–visible spectrophotometer (Figure 10c). The kinetics study was
carried out by using 20 ppm phenol concentration (20 mL) with a catalyst
dose of 0.02 g at an optimum pH of 7. The kinetics results of phenol
oxidation follow Langmuir–Hinshelwood pseudo-first-order kinetics,
which is expressed as follows: 9  where k is the rate
constant
for the degradation reaction in min–1, C0 is the initial concentration of the substrate, and C is the final concentration at time t.
The plot of ln(C0/C)
versus time results a straight line with slope kapp estimated via linear fitting of the regression curve. The
apparent oxidizing rate constant (kapp) and correlation coefficient (R2) of
phenol oxidation over different as-prepared catalysts were determined
and listed in Table S2. It was calculated
that CNLDHAgP4 holds a higher rate constant value of 0.00751 min–1, which was 2.28, 5.28, 1.73, and 1.20 times higher
than that of NiFe LDH (0.00329 min–1), g-C3N4 (0.00142 min–1), Ag3PO4 (0.00433 min–1), and CNLDH (0.00625 min–1), respectively.

2.1.7 Effect
of Scavengers on the Photooxidation
of Phenol
To evaluate the participating active species in
the mechanism of photooxidation of phenol over CNLDHAgP4, the scavenger
experiment was carried out under sunlight irradiation. In a typical
experiment, 1 mM isopropyl alcohol (IPA) (•OH),
BQ (•O2–), DMSO (e–), and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (h+) were added to a solution that contained phenol (20 ppm)
and the CNLDHAgP4 catalyst (0.02 g). The mixture was subjected to
sunlight irradiation for 120 min. Figure S2b shows the effect of different scavengers on the photooxidation of
phenol. The result indicated that a reduction in the photooxidation
activities of 23, 36, 80, and 88% was found for IPA, EDTA, p-BQ, and DMSO, respectively. These results confirms that
the primary reactive species responsible for the photooxidation of
phenol was the •OH and h+ as the secondary
reactive species. The role of •O2– and e– was considered to be negligible
in the photooxidation process of phenol. Furthermore, the quantification
experiments of •OH were carried out under sunlight
irradiation for 2 h by measuring the fluorescence intensity of 2-hydroxyterephthalic
acid (TAOH) in a PL probing technique (Figure S3). Terephthalic acid acted as a probe molecule that reacts
with •OH radical to generate a fluorescence active
product TAOH with an emission peak at 426 nm. The intensity of the
PL spectrum of TAOH is directly proportional to the quantity of the •OH radical. The highest PL intensity of the heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4 indicates the higher amount of the formation of •OH radicals as compared to neat NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and Ag3PO4 materials. Additionally, the presence
of surface −OH groups in NiFe LDH further promotes in producing •OH radicals, which play a number of roles in the photocatalytic
oxidation process. The difference in the fluorescence intensity of
the TAOH measurement experiment sturdily favors the best catalytic
activities of CNLDHAgP4, which was achieved due to the better interfacial
charge separation at the dual heterojunction interface. Table 2 represents a state-of-the-art
for the comparison of Cr(VI) reduction and phenol oxidation potential
over heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposites with other reported
materials.

2.1.8 Recyclability
Study of the Heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4
It is important to test the recyclability of a
photocatalyst for practical application as its efficiency may change
after the interaction with a particular pollutant in aqueous medium
under sunlight irradiation. To confirm the photostability and reusability
of the catalyst for real-time applications, the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4
nanocomposite was evaluated for five different recycle experiments
for the reduction reaction of Cr(VI) and phenol oxidation activities
(Figure S4). Average 95% of Cr(VI) reduction
and 89% oxidation of phenol were maintained at the end of five repeating
cycles over heterostructure CNLDHAgP4. Figure S5a represents the FTIR analysis of the CNLDHAgP4 sample after
Cr(VI) reduction activities. The spectra prominently show a peak shifting
toward the lower wave number region. These results are indicative
of good interaction between CNLDHAgP4 and Cr(VI), and the characteristic
spectral peaks are still preserved even after five repeated cycles
of the reduction reaction process. Additionally, available UV–vis
DRS spectra after Cr(VI) reduction (Figure S5b) concluded a little change in the absorption intensity of CNLDHAgP4.
The amount of leached silver ion concentration was also investigated
by using pure Ag3PO4 and Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH during phenol oxidation
over a time study of 60 min and analyzed through inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) as shown in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). The plot in Figure S6 shows the released silver ion concentration
measured through ICP-MS versus time. At the beginning, a sharp increase
of released silver ion concentration was found in the pure Ag3PO4 sample, whereas the release of silver ion concentration
was relatively slow in Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH. Also, the concentration of silver ion released
from the pure Ag3PO4 sample was more than that
of Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe
LDH. After 30 min of irradiation, the silver ion concentration was
found to decrease in both the photocatalysts, which could be ascribed
to the reduction of Ag+ to metallic Ag0 NPs
by the photogenerated electrons on the surface of the photocatalyst.
The slow release of silver ion in Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposite indicates slower decomposition
of Ag3PO4, which firmly demonstrate the excellent
stability of Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposite than pure Ag3PO4 during photocatalytic reactions. However, the reusable efficiency
of phenol oxidation is far below than Cr(VI) reduction with the increase
of repeating cycle, which could be explained by the subsequent reasons.
First, the leached silver ions were present during the first 30 min
reuse of the catalyst (first cycle), which directly results in the
loss of the silver ions of the photocatalyst in the subsequent reactions
with further cycles. Second, the formation of phenol intermediate
products such as catechol (278–280 nm) and p-BQ (249 nm) blocks the active sites, thus decreasing the photocatalytic
efficiency of CNLDHAgP4 during the phenol recycle studies. In addition,
the decreasing efficiency trend of phenol oxidation would be in reverse
order with the increase in repeating cycle, when the intermediate
products completely mineralize into CO2 and H2O. This illustrates that the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 could retain
excellent photocatalytic activity even after five repeated cycles
of use, which established its high stability and reusability for the
management of wastewater contaminated with Cr(VI) and phenol.

2.2 In-Depth Charge Separation and Photocatalytic
Mechanism behind the Construction of a Quasi-Type-II p–n/n–n
Dual Heterojunction in the CNLDHAgP4 System
The higher photocatalytic
activities of CHLDHAgP4 were mainly credited to the establishment
of a quasi-type-II p–n/n–n dual heterojunction consisting
of n-type NiFe LDH, n-type g-C3N4, p-type Ag3PO4, and plasmon-excited Ag NPs. The mechanistic
path of photoinduced charge separation and transfer in an interfacial
region of dual heterojunctions is a vital factor to not only enhance
the photocatalytic efficiencies of a material but also affect its
durability to a greater extent. For better understanding of the carrier
charge separation at the interfacial region of p–n/n–n
dual heterojunctions, various characteristic techniques such as PL,
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), and Mott–Schottky
(M–S) results were discussed.

2.2.1 PL
Study
The charge carrier transport
across the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx nanocomposite
was further revealed through PL emission spectroscopy excited at 380
nm and compared with NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH,
and Ag3PO4 (Figure 11). Pristine NiFe LDH exhibited three types
of emission band at 442 (strong), 460 (strong), and 575 nm (medium).
The centered peaks at 442 and 460 nm were associated with the radiative
recombination of charge carriers associated with the ligand field
transitions of Ni2+ octahedrons.68 The continuous steady emission at 575 nm was due to the surface
defects of NiFe LDH.10 g-C3N4 shows a distinct emission peak centered at 460 nm, which
could be ascribed to the band-to-band PL emission related to the approximate
band gap energy of g-C3N4.10 The emission peak intensity of the CNLDH composite was
sharply decreased as compared to that of NiFe LDH and g-C3N4 because of the suppression of charge carriers, and
the main reason was the strong quantum confinement effect caused by
the highly extended g-C3N4 on NiFe LDH.10 In Ag3PO4, a strong emission
peak at 440 (blue) and a weak emission peak at around 550 nm (green)
were observed in the spectra. According to Liang et al., the origin
of luminescence properties in Ag3PO4 originated
from the recombination of charge carrier transition between O 2p →
Ag 5d orbital or owing to the self-trapped excitons in the PO4 oxyanion complex.61 Botelho et
al. also demonstrated the origin of PL properties of Ag3PO4 because of the charge transition in [PO4] and [AgO4] clusters.69 The
blue emission peak in Ag3PO4 arises because
of the [PO4] clusters and the green emission peak arises
because of the highly distorted tetrahedral [AgO4] clusters.69 The PL spectra of the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx were significantly lower than that of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and CNLDH. Especially
in CNLDHAgP4, significant suppression of charge carrier was found,
which was ∼2 times reduced than that of CNLDH and ∼4
times reduced than that of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4,
and Ag3PO4. CNLDHAgP4 exhibited a blue-shifted
emission peak at 460, a green-shifted emission peak at 540, and a
red-shifted emission peak at 575 nm, respectively. The emission in
the blue-shifted region of CNLDHAgP4 indicated the presence of the
quantum confinement effect of g-C3N4 and a high
contribution of [PO4] clusters of Ag3PO4. The presence of the [PO4] cluster was further
confirmed by the presence of the asymmetric stretching vibration peak
of P–O at 1068 cm–1 in FTIR spectra (Figure 3b). The green emission
at 540 nm was due to the presence of Ov-type defects (oxygen
vacancy defect complex) CNLDHAgP4.70 The
red-shifted emission peak found at 575 nm was associated with the
combined results of the plasmonic effect of Ag NPs and intermediate
energy levels of [AgO4] clusters of Ag3PO4 in CNLDHAgP4. In this way, PL spectroscopy greatly revealed
the effective charge separation in CNLDHAgP4, which proves the incremental
antirecombination process of exciton pairs in the as-synthesized heterostructure
material for superior photocatalytic activity.

g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, CNLDH,
and heterostructure CNLDHAgPx samples measured at
room temperature with an excitation energy of
380 nm.

2.2.2 EIS
Measurement Study
EIS has been
proven to be a significant tool for the investigation of the charge
carrier separation and charge-transfer process across the electrode
and electrolyte interfacial contact area in a three-electrode electrochemical
workstation. The EIS spectra of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, CNLDH, and CNLDHAgP4 of the as-prepared
electrodes are shown in Figure 12. The equivalence fitted model circuit for the CNLDHAgP4
electrode is shown in the inset in Figure 12. R1 can be
assigned as the series resistance of the system. R2 can be assigned as the charge-transfer resistance across
the Pt counterelectrode/electrolyte interface, which represents the
first semicircle in the high-frequency region of 25–40 Ω
for the CNLDHAgP4 electrode system. The second semicircle in the middle
frequency region of 15–25 Ω could be assigned to the
charge-transfer resistance (R2) of the
as-prepared CNLDHAgP4 electrode and electrolyte interface. The R3 represents the charge-transfer resistance
in the Helmholtz double layer, whereas CPE1 and CPE2 represent the
chemical capacitance. The EIS spectra clearly indicate the reduced
diameter of the arc radius of the CNLDHAgP4 electrode than those of
the other as-prepared electrodes, which reveals the faster interfacial
charge transfer and separation efficiency of the CNLDHAgP4 electrode
system. The sequential arrangement of the charge-transfer resistance
value of the as-prepared electrode follows the order: CNLDHAgP4 (37.5 Ω)
< CNLDH (52.3 Ω) < g-C3N4 (59.1
Ω) < Ag3PO4 (60.8 Ω) < NiFe
LDH (154.2 Ω).

2.2.3 M–S
Analysis
Generally,
the basic principles of M–S measurements were based on the
Schottky barrier generated during the contact of semiconductor with
electrolyte solution and was employed to determine the carrier density
of a semiconductor material.71,72 The slopes of the M–S
plots are very much crucial in judging the n-type semiconductor properties
with a positive slope and p-type semiconductor properties with a negative
slope tilting toward the X-axis.71,72 To approximate the flat band potential (Vfb), the following equation is used: 10  where ε, ε0, Nd, Vapp, and Vfb symbolize the dielectric constant
of a semiconductor,
vacuum permittivity, donor density, applied potential, and flat band
potential and kT/q is a temperature-dependent
term in the M–S equation, respectively. The intercept value
of the linear plot at 1/C2 = 0 gives the
flat band potential (Vfb). The Vfb is approximately equal to the CB potential
(ECB) for n-type semiconductors and VB
potential (EVB) for p-type semiconductors.
In accordance with the intercept of the M–S plots (Figure 13a,b), the Vfb for NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH, Ag3PO4, and CNLDHAgP4 were estimated
to be about −0.01, −0.54, −0.37, +2.88, and +2.49
V versus NHE, respectively. Therefore, the ECB potential of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and
CNLDH were estimated to be −0.01, −0.54, and −0.37
V, respectively. In our previously reported work,10 the ECB levels of g-C3N4 were calculated to be −1.13 V versus Ag/AgCl
by using LSV plots (Figure 1B), and in the present work, we have converted the values
versus NHE to get a comparable energy level matching with the M–S
plot for the proper description of the mechanism, and here, the estimated ECB value of g-C3N4 was
−0.53 V versus NHE (Figure 13a). Notably, electrode potentials were converted to
the NHE scale using the following equation:73 11  E0(Ag/AgCl) =
0.197 at 25 °C, ECB(Ag/AgCl) is the
experimentally deliberate potential against the Ag/AgCl reference
electrode, and the measured pH value of the electrolyte was found
to be approximately 6.5 for the 0.1 M Na2SO4 electrolyte.

Figure 13 M–S plots of (a) NiFe LDH, CN, and CNLDH and (b)
Ag3PO4 and heterostructure CNLDHAgP4.

Furthermore, by analyzing these
data in combination with the band
gap energy (Eg) achieved from the Kubelka–Munk
spectra (Figure 8),
the EVB positions of the NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, and CNLDH were calculated to be +2.19, +2.16, and +1.98
V, respectively. Likewise, the ECB and EVB potentials of Ag3PO4 were calculated to be +0.45 and +2.88 V, respectively. The ECB and EVB potentials
of CNLDHAgP4 were calculated to be +0.11 and +2.49 V, respectively.
Generally, the Fermi level is assumed to be present at 0.1 eV beneath
the CB edge of n-type semiconductors and 0.1 eV above the VB edge
of p-type semiconductors.74 Earlier, it
was confirmed from the LSV measurement study that both NiFe LDH and
g-C3N4 belong to the n-type semiconductor, whereas
CNLDH is a n–n-type semiconductor.10 From the LSV measurement studies (Figure 1D), Ag3PO4 was confirmed
to be a p-type semiconductor. Chen et al. also reported the p-type
semiconductor properties of Ag3PO4 in the heterostructure
Ag/Ag3PO4/TiO2.38 Therefore, the respective Fermi level positions of NiFe
LDH, g-C3N4, CNLDH, Ag3PO4, and CNLDHAgP4 were estimated to be +0.11, −0.44, −0.27,
+2.78, and +0.2 V versus NHE, respectively.74

The M–S plot of the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 (Figure 13b) clearly displayed
an inverted “V-shaped” curve with two flat band potentials,
which reveals the existence of p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions
and corresponds to the existence of both positive and negative charge
carriers.71,72 A slightly intense slope in the M–S
curves of CNLDHAgP4 than that of NiFe LDH and g-C3N4 indicates lower donor density and reveals the presence of
p-type Ag3PO4 in CNLDHAgP4. The heterostructure
CNLDHAgP4 exhibits a negative shift in the CB edge (+0.11 V vs NHE)
in comparison to p-type Ag3PO4 (+0.45 V vs NHE).
It has been well-known that the higher Vfb (EVB) value of the p-type semiconductor
signifies a higher degree of band bending, which resulted in a larger
space charge region for charge separation. The higher EVB potential of +2.49 V in CNLDHAgP4 exerts a strong driving
force for the separation of photogenerated charge pairs in the space
charge region, which results in higher photocatalytic activities.
This is due to the fact that the electron and hole pairs were trapped
in the depletion layer of the electric field induced at the interface
of p–n/n–n dual heterojunctions after equilibration
of the Fermi level of all the constituent semiconductors in CNLDHAgP4.
According to the semiconductor theory, the position of Fermi level
and band edge potentials was an important criterion for the band alignment
in a semiconductor heterojunction.

Given the above discussion,
a mechanism of superior charge separation
for the enhanced Cr(VI) reduction and phenol oxidation activities
in the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 was proposed and shown in Scheme 1. The possible band
alignment of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and Ag NPs before and after contact was systematically
described in Scheme 1. The entire photocatalytic reaction process was initiated by the
photon energy absorption equal to or higher than the band gap energy,
which causes the generation of electron–hole pairs from the
photoexcited semiconductor components. Before contact (Scheme 1a), the band alignment of NiFe
LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and
Ag NPs becomes messy, which is unable to support the charge separation
of carriers. However, after contact, when p–n/n–n dual
heterojunctions were formed, despite the lower CB edge potential of
Ag3PO4, the electrons would flow from Ag3PO4 to g-C3N4 and then to
NiFe LDH. It was due to the Fermi level alignment of the constituent
semiconductor with the SPR effect of Ag NPs, which has a significant
role in the charge separation of dual heterojunctions in CNLDHAgP4.
After the contact (Scheme 1b), the CB and VB edge potential of g3PO4, g-C3N4, and NiFe LDH changes to reach the
equilibration of Fermi levels (Ef). The
Fermi level of Ag is situated at 0.4 V (vs NHE).60 The SPR absorption of Ag NPs was found at 560 nm as verified
from the UV–vis DRS spectra of the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4;
consequently, the SPR electrons of Ag NPs were excited at an energy
of 1.81 eV with regard to the Fermi level of Ag NPs. In order to maintain
the energy band alignment during the course of formation of heterostructures,
the Fermi level of Ag will shift to a position more negative than
−1.81 V versus NHE in the presence of visible light irradiation.
When the constituent phases acquire an equalized Fermi level, a built-in
electric field directed from p-type Ag3PO4 to
the n-type g-C3N4 and then to the n-type NiFe
LDH will be established, which can stop the charge diffusion between
them.71,72,74 At the meantime,
because of the SPR generated electronic drifting effect of Ag NPs,
the energy bands of p-type Ag3PO4 shifted upward
along with the Ef, whereas those of the
n-type g-C3N4 and n-type NiFe LDH shifted downward
to maintain an overall Fermi level equilibration in this process.
The newly formed well-aligned band structures become to the interactive
structure in CNLDHAgP4 interface (Scheme 1b).

Scheme 1 (a) Diagrammatical Representation
of the Energy Band Positions of
n-Type NiFe LDH, n-Type g-C3N4, p-Type Ag3PO4, and Ag NPs (before Contact), (b) Formation
of Quasi-Type-II p–n/n–n Dual Heterojunctions and the
Charge Separation Mechanism over Heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 under Visible
Light Irradiation (after Contact)
Accordingly, the Fermi level of the excited electrons
formed due
to the effect of SPR excitation of the plasmonic-metal Ag NPs can
be directly transferred to the CB of Ag3PO4,
which flows toward the CB of the g-C3N4 semiconductor
and then gets trapped by the oxygen vacancy (Ov) captured
center of NiFe LDH. Yang et al. also proved that the Ag NP-based SPR
generated electronic injection in the P/Ag/Ag2O/Ag3PO4/TiO2 system.53 The green emission peak at 540 nm in PL spectra and the
oxygen vacancy peak at the BE of 531.6 eV in the XPS spectra of CNLDHAgP4
confirm the defect type of Ov.75 The energy level of Ov is about 0.9 V deeper than the
CB of any semiconductor similar to that in NiFe LDH (−0.01
V).76 Therefore, the photoelectron in g-C3N4 can be easily transferred to the Ov of NiFe LDH. Simultaneously, photogenerated holes in the VB of NiFe
LDH could easily move to the VB of g-C3N4 and
then to the VB of Ag3PO4. This process not only
facilitates the charge separation but also accumulates electrons in
the CB of NiFe LDH and holes in the VB of Ag3PO4, respectively. Moreover, the presence of the built-in electric field
near the interface can also facilitate the separation of photogenerated
electron–hole pairs. In this way, a quasi-type II p–n/n–n
dual heterojunction has been established in the CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposite
and greatly promotes the separation of charge carriers.

Under
these circumstances, a large number of electrons were accumulated
and generated on the CB of n-type NiFe LDH because of photoexcitation
and transfer process. As the CB edge potential of n-type NiFe LDH
(0.29 eV) was not sufficiently negative to reduce O2/•O2–(−0.33 eV vs
NHE),50,60 the electrons enriched on the surface of
NiFe LDH could not be trapped by the molecular oxygen in the solution
to form •O2–. Alternatively,
the accumulated electrons at the CB edge of NiFe LDH exhibited more
negative potential than the reduction potential of Cr(VI)/Cr(III),
that is, +1.33 eV versus NHE, which indicates that more electrons
were subsequently captured by Cr(VI) and helped in the reduction of
Cr(VI) to Cr(III). This Cr(VI) reduction mechanism over CNLDHAgP4
was also well supported with the mechanism reported by Fu et al.63 In addition, the scavenger test of the Cr(VI)
reduction reaction proved that direct accumulated electrons at the
bottom of CB are responsible for Cr(VI) reduction. Figure S2a depicts that the addition of mixed solution containing
both CH3OH (2 mL) and citric acid (1 mL) as hole scavengers
could react with the photogenerated holes at the VB of CNLDHAgP4 and
decrease the photoreduction time of the parts per million concentration
of Cr(VI) solution to 60 min for complete reduction process. Moreover,
the VB potential of Ag3PO4 is +2.40 eV (after
contact), which has a more positive potential than the redox potential
of •OH/OH– (+1.99 eV vs NHE);77 hence, OH– can be oxidized
to •OH by holes. As such, the accumulated holes
left in the VB of Ag3PO4 will directly oxidize
phenol into nontoxic products78 or oxidize
H2O to form •OH active species, which
subsequently oxidized phenol to CO2 and H2O.
Similarly, from the scavenger test of phenol (Figure S2b), •OH and h+ were
found to be the major and minor participating active species behind
the mechanism of photooxidation of phenol. The production of •OH radicals was confirmed by the terephthalic acid
test shown in Figure S3. On the basis of
the above-mentioned discussion, the heterostructure CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposite
follows the quasi-type-II dual p–n/n–n heterojunction
mechanism for the photooxidation of phenol, which involves •OH and h+ as the reactive species and accumulated electrons
as the reactive species for Cr(VI) reduction. Most importantly, Ag3PO4 can be protected from photocorrosion by transferring
the photogenerated electrons to g-C3N4 and then
to NiFe LDH, respectively. Therefore, the presence of Ag NPs could
greatly improve the photostability of the CNLDHAgP4 nanocomposite.
In addition, the structural stability of exfoliated NiFe LDH nanosheets
can be well maintained because of the formation of a Schottky barrier
across the n–n junction between g-C3N4 and NiFe LDH and follows a self-stability mechanism.79 Therefore, the synergistic interaction of Ag3PO4, Ag NPs, g-C3N4, and
NiFe LDH plays crucial roles in improving both the photocatalytic
activity and stability of the as-prepared heterostructure CNLDHAgP4
nanocomposite.

3 Conclusions
Plasmonic
heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposites were successfully synthesized
by the combination of an electrostatic self-assembly and in situ photoreduction
method. The formation of quasi-type-II p–n/n–n dual
heterojunctions between p-type Ag3PO4/n-type
g-C3N4/n-type NiFe LDH with the SPR effect of
Ag NPs leads to a remarkable enhancement in the photocatalytic performance
of the heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH. The obvious enhancement of the photocatalytic
performance of this heterostructure is mainly credited to the intimate
Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH
interface created by its exceptional dual heterojunction architecture,
which in turn allows rapid charge-transfer process. Furthermore, the
quenching of PL intensity, highest photocurrent density (−7.90
mA cm–2), and reduced arc of the Nyquist plot (37.5
Ω) strongly manifest the effective charge separation and enhanced
photocatalytic performance of CNLDHAgP4. Most importantly, the remarkable
photocatalytic performance of CNLDHAgP4 for Cr(VI) reduction (97%)
and phenol oxidation (90%) was far superior to that of NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, and CNLDH. Overall,
the result of this finding was invigorating and might provide a new
methodology for developing high-performance and cost-effective LDH-based
plasmonic heterojunction photocatalysts for maximum photon absorption
to thrash the challenging environmental remediation.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Chemicals
Natural
graphite powder
(Aldrich, 99%), melamine (Aldrich, 99.0%), Ni(NO3)2·6H2O (Aldrich, 99.0%), Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Aldrich, 99.0%), NaOH (Merck India,
99.5%), CH3OH (Merck India, 99%), AgNO3 (Merck
India, 99.9%), 4-aminoantipyrene (Merck India, 98%), and potassium
ferricyanide (Aldrich, 99.5%) were used as received. The metal salt
solutions were prepared by using deionized water. The other reagents
used in this research work are of analytically certified pure grade
and directly used for the experimental process and analysis protocol.

4.2 Fabrication of Pristine NiFe LDH
Pristine
NiFe LDH was synthesized according to our previous standardized
method.10 In a typical procedure, 0.5 M
NaOH solution and 100 mL mixed metal nitrate solution consisting of
0.16 M Ni(NO3)2·6H2O and 0.033
M Fe(NO3)3·9H2O ([Ni2+ + Fe3+] = 0.2 M) were simultaneously added dropwise to
a beaker containing 50 mL deionized water at a constant pH of 9.0.
The obtained yellow brown colored precipitate was aged for 24 h at
room temperature and then filtered, followed by washing with water
and ethanol. The washed precipitate was thoroughly dried in an oven
at 80 °C overnight and then grinded for further use.

4.3 Fabrication of Pristine g-C3N4
Pristine g-C3N4 was prepared
by the heat treatment of melamine.10 In
a typical experiment, 5.0 g of melamine underwent calcination at 550
°C for 4 h with a heating rate of 2.5 °C/min. The product
was naturally cooled down to room temperature, and then the as-obtained
yellow color solid mass was grounded into a powder form, yielding
light yellow color g-C3N4 designated as CN.

4.4 Preparation of Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH
In a typical synthesis
method of heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposites, an appropriate 10 wt
% of g-C3N4 with respect to NiFe LDH was dispersed
in CH3OH (100 mL) and ultrasonicated for 1 h for complete
dispersion in accordance with our previous report.10 To this dispersion, approximately 1 g of freshly prepared
NiFe LDH was introduced under vigorous stirring under an N2 atmosphere at room temperature. The mixed dispersion of both NiFe
LDH and g-C3N4 was ultrasonicated for another
2 h to reach the electrostatic self-assembly between exfoliated positively
charged sheets of NiFe LDH and negatively charged sheets of g-C3N4. A calculated amount of AgNO3 was
added to the CNLDH dispersion to maintain the 3:1 molar ratio of Ag+/PO43–, followed by ultrasonication
for another 15 min. Afterward, an aqueous solution of (NH4)2HPO4 was added dropwise to the CNLDH dispersion
with vigorous stirring, followed by 15 min exposure of visible light
irradiation. Finally, the whole precipitate was aged for 2 h. In this
manner, different wt % (2, 4, 6, and 8) of the heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH was synthesized
by varying Ag3PO4 over CNLDH and designated
as CNLDHAgPx, x = 2, 4, 6, and 8
wt %, respectively. The precipitated solids were separated by centrifugation,
followed by thorough washing with deionized water and then with ethanol.
The solid materials were dried at 70 °C for further characterization,
and the photocatalytic activities were tested. The formation of the
heterostructure nanocomposite was clearly revealed from the color
change from pale yellow to greenish brown. During the synthesis of
heterostructure nanocomposites, the entire constituent semiconductor
being the photocatalyst formed e––h+ pairs under visible light irradiation. The hole was trapped by the
dry methanol as scavenger and the electron was used to reduce Ag+ to metallic Ag NPs, thereby producing a heterostructure Ag@Ag3PO4/g-C3N4/NiFe LDH nanocomposite.
The pristine Ag3PO4 was prepared by following
the same procedure but without the steps that involved LDH, g-C3N4, and irradiation of visible light. For the purpose
of comparison, g-C3N4/NiFe LDH (CNLDH) composites
were prepared following the same procedure similar to that of the
heterostructure CNLDHAgPx but excluded the addition
of AgNO3, (NH4)2HPO4,
and visible light illumination. Besides, the exfoliated self-assembled
CNLDH hybrid was aged in a fume hood for 24 h. The obtained powder
was dried at 100 °C overnight, yielding CNLDH composites. The
synthetic steps of the heterostructure CNLDHAgPx are
illustrated in 2 2.

Scheme 2 Synthetic Steps of
the Heterostructure CNLDHAgPx Nanocomposite
4.5 Characterization
The crystal phase
purity of the prepared sample was measured by powder XRD using a Rigaku
MiniFlex (set at 30 kV and 15 mA) instrument over the range of 5°
< 2θ < 70° with a scan rate of 0.02° min–1. The stretching vibration mode of the catalyst was
determined using an FTIR spectrometer (JASCO FT/IR-4600) within the
range of 4000–400 cm–1 using KBr as the reference
compound for the measurement process. The UV)–vis DR spectra
of the materials were measured using a JASCO-V-750 UV–vis spectrophotometer
attached with DR accessory within the range of 200–800 nm,
and boric acid pellets were used as the reference compound. The PL
spectra were measured and analyzed on a JASCO-FP-8300 fluorescence
spectrophotometer with an excitation energy of 380 nm. The HRTEM images
and EDX spectra were obtained on a FEI, Tecnai G220, TWIN, Philips
system at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The XPS measurements
were performed on a VG Microtech Multilab ESCA 3000 spectrometer with
a nonmonochromatized Mg Kα X-ray source and an energy of 0.8
eV. The BE correction was performed by the C 1s reference peak of
carbon atom at 284.9 eV. ICP-MS (Agilent 7500) was used for the quantification
of leached silver ion concentration. The photoelectrochemical studies
were carried out by preparing the working electrode of the synthesized
catalyst (NiFe LDH, g-C3N4, Ag3PO4, CNLDH, and CNLDHAgP4) by the electrophoretic deposition
method over a fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)-coated surface. The as-synthesized
catalyst (30 mg) was mixed with 20 mg of iodine powder and 30 mL of
acetone solution and sonicated for 15 min. Afterward, two FTO electrodes
were dipped inside the solution facing parallel to each other with
10–20 mm of separation between them. A 60 V bias applied potential
was fixed for 3 min through potentiostat. The uniformity of the coated
area was fixed at 1 cm × 1 cm and then dried at 80 °C for
2 h. All the photoelectrochemical studies were carried out on an IVIUM-n-STAT
electrochemical workstation. An aqueous solution containing 0.1 M
Na2SO4 was used as an electrolyte with a standard
three-electrode cell attached with a quartz pane and potentiostat–galvanostat.
FTO-coated films were used as the working electrode, while the Pt
electrode was used as the counter electrode and Ag/AgCl as the reference
electrode. A 300 W Xe lamp (ORIEL) was used as the visible light source.
EIS was measured at a frequency scan of 10 000–0.01 Hz at a
potential of 0.1 V in 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution
in an open-circuit potential. The M–S measurement was carried
out at a constant frequency of 500 Hz under dark. The LSV plots were
evaluated by a potential biasing of −2 to +3 V at a scan rate
of 0.05 mV s–1 under both dark and light illuminations,
respectively.

4.6 Photocatalytic Activity
The photocatalytic
Cr(VI) reduction reaction of the samples was carried out by using
an aqueous K2Cr2O7 solution. To access
the photocatalytic activity, 0.02 g of catalysts was added to 20 mL
of 20 ppm Cr(VI) solution taken in a Pyrex conical flask, and the
reaction was continued for 2 h. Initially, the photocatalytic reduction
of Cr(VI) samples was measured at different pH values of 5, 6, and
8, respectively. The suspension of the catalyst and Cr(VI) solution
was kept under constant stirring in dark around 30 min in order to
reach the adsorption and desorption equilibrium prior to sunlight
exposure (100 000 lx). The residual concentration of Cr(VI)
over a period of time was colorimetrically analyzed by the 1,5-diphenylcarbazide
method using a JASCO-V-750 UV–vis spectrophotometer at λmax 540 nm.36 In addition, the remaining
Cr(VI) concentration in the sample was also determined after the photocatalytic
activity.37 The photocatalytic degradation
of phenol was carried out by adding 0.02 g of the catalyst to 20 mL
of phenol (20 ppm) taken in a 100 mL stoppered Pyrex conical flask.
The experiments were continued for 2 h in the presence of sunlight.
The suspension of the catalyst and phenol solution was kept under
constant stirring in dark around 30 min to reach the adsorption and
desorption equilibrium prior to sunlight exposure (100 000 lx). Furthermore,
the photocatalytic degradation of phenol was measured at different
pH values of 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11. After the photocatalytic activities,
the residual concentration of phenol was measured by a JASCO-V-750
UV–vis spectrophotometer.
