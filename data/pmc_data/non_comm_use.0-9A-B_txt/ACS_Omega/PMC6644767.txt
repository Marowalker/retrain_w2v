Inorganic cesium lead triiodide (CsPbI3) perovskite
materials are becoming increasingly attractive for use in perovskite/silicon
tandem solar cells, due to their almost ideal band gap energy (Eg) of about 1.7 eV. To be useful as photovoltaic
absorbers, the CsPbI3 must form the cubic or black phase
(α-CsPbI3). To do so at relatively low temperatures,
hydroiodic acid (HI) is required as a solution additive. This paper
demonstrates CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells with an efficiency
of 6.44%, formed using a HI concentration of 36 μL/mL. This
value is higher than the previous most commonly used HI additive concentration.
Herein, by undertaking a systematic study of the HI concentration,
we demonstrate that the structural, morphological, optical, and electrical
properties of CsPbI3 solar cells, processed with this HI
additive concentration, are superior.

1 Introduction
Solar
cells based on perovskite materials have recently received
considerable attention in the photovoltaics community.1−8 Due to the high efficiency and simple, low-cost fabrication technique,
it is considered as the most exciting among all of the emerging photovoltaic
technologies.9−11 Several attractive features possessed by the perovskite
materials include: high absorption coefficient,12 long carrier diffusion length,13 high electron mobility,14 and tuneable
band gap.15 From the initial reported power
conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.8% since 2009,16 the efficiency of perovskite-based solar cells have recently
reached above 22%.17 Perovskite materials
can be expressed by the generic formula ABX3, where A typically
stands for an organic cation (usually methyl ammonium [CH3NH3+] or formamidinium [CHNH3+]), B stands for divalent metal ion (typically Pb2+ or Sn2+), and X is a single or mixed halide ion (Cl–, Br–, or I–).18−21 Despite showing several demonstrated advantages, perovskite solar
cells are yet to reach the commercialization stage, due mainly to
the problem with stability.22 The hygroscopic
organic cation is considered as the main reason behind the poor stability.23 Therefore, researchers are currently trying
to develop perovskites by replacing the organic cation by an inorganic
counterpart.24 Several reports have demonstrated
different all-inorganic perovskite approaches employing CsPbBr3,25 CsPbI2Br,26 CsPbIBr2,27 and CsPbI3.28 To address the
ever-increasing energy demand, researchers are also looking to go
beyond the theoretical efficiency of single-junction solar cells by
implementing multijunction configuration known as tandem solar cells.29 Holman and co-workers have shown that the maximum efficiency of a tandem
solar cell can reach up to 43% under 1 sun illumination considering
a Si-wafer-based bottom cell band gap of 1.12 eV and a top cell band
gap of 1.7 eV.30,31

Among the available inorganic
perovskites, cesium lead triiodide
(CsPbI3) has a band gap of 1.7 eV, which makes it a potential
candidate to be used as a top cell absorber layer for a tandem structure.32 CsPbI3 has been gaining attention
as a novel photovoltaic absorber under the perovskite family.33−36 In 2014, Kim et al. reported CsPbI3 absorber-based solar
cells for the first time with an efficiency of 0.09%.37 Afterward, Snaith et al. demonstrated CsPbI3-based solar cells with an efficiency of 2.9%.28 Taima and co-workers employed sequential vapor deposition
to obtain an efficiency of 5.71%.38 CsPbI3 has two phases, i.e., (i) orthorhombic or yellow phase (δ-CsPbI3) and (ii) cubic or black phase (α-CsPbI3).32 The black phase is the desired phase
to be used in the solar cell absorber, however, CsPbI3 is
only stable in the yellow phase at room temperature.36,39 High temperature (>310 °C) is required to convert the yellow
phase into black phase.28,36 Snaith and co-workers
used 33 μL/mL HI as an additive in the CsPbI3 perovskite
precursor solution to enable low-temperature (≈100 °C)
phase transition.28 It is believed that
the strained crystal lattice resulting from the addition of HI in
the precursor is responsible for low-temperature phase transition.
Different groups have reported CsPbI3 solar cells using
this HI additive route to obtain low-temperature phase transition.28,32,35,36 However, no detailed study has been reported on the effects of varying
HI additive concentrations on the properties of the CsPbI3 perovskite layer as well as on the entire photovoltaic device.

In this work, we present a systematic investigation of the influence
of the HI concentration (30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 μL) on the structural,
optical, and morphological properties of the perovskite layer. Also,
the perovskite layers formed with different HI additive concentrations
were incorporated in the inverted device structure indium tin oxide
(ITO)/poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)/perovskite/[6,6]-phenyl
C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)/Ag. The
average efficiency was found to be highest for devices containing
the perovskite layers formed with the 36 μL HI additive.

2 Results and Discussion
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was
carried out to characterize the structural
properties of the CsPbI3 thin films with various HI concentrations. Figure 1 shows the XRD patterns
of the CsPbI3 thin films with 30, 33, 36, 39, and 42 μL/mL
HI additive concentration. For all of the films, the presence of (100),
(110), (200), (211), and (220) diffraction peaks indicate the formation
of cubic or black phase CsPbI3, which is consistent with
previous reports.28,35 The lattice constant “a” for the cubic phase structure [hkl] was calculated by the Bragg’s law and Vegard’s law.40−43 1   2  where dhkl corresponds
to the interplanar spacing value, λ is the X-ray wavelength
(0.15406 nm), n is the order number, θ is the
Bragg’s angle, and acubic is the
lattice constant. The calculated dhkl and acubic values are represented
in Table S1.

Figure 1 X-ray diffraction (XRD)
patterns of CsPbI3 layers with
different HI additive concentrations in the precursor solution. The
patterns are offset for clarity.

Changing the HI concentration does not change the position
of the
peaks. In terms of peak intensity, films formed with 36 μL HI
have shown maximum intensity for the (100) and (200) peaks, which
typically corresponds to the black phase of CsPbI3.36 This observation clearly suggests that using
36 μL HI instead of 33 μL leads to increased crystallinity.
From the XRD patterns, the peak splitting of the (110) peak and the
small shoulder observed for the (200) peak are also consistent to
the literature suggesting the presence of strain in the crystal.28 Different research groups have already reported
that strain is capable of inducing phase transitions in a crystal
structure and can completely shift the phase diagram for a material.44,45 Moreover, the addition of HI in the perovskite precursor is believed
to enhance the solubility of PbI2 by the formation of an
intermediate compound HPbI3.46,47 Hence, it
is assumed that the presence of strain due to the incorporation of
HI additive is the main reason for allowing lower-temperature phase
transition for attaining CsPbI3 in the black phase.

To study the effect of HI concentration on different structural
parameters, the mean crystallite sizes (D), microstrain
values (ε), and dislocation densities (δ) were calculated
using the following equations, respectively.48,49 3   4   5  where β is the full width at half-maximum
of the diffraction peak located at 2θ and n is a factor which almost equals to unity for minimum dislocation
density. The calculated values of the crystallite size, microstrain,
and dislocation densities are represented in Table S1.

Figure 2 depicts
the normalized peak intensity and the crystallite size. From the normalized
peak intensities, it is clearly visible that all of the films have
shown strong orientation along the (100) and (200) planes. For all
of the variations of HI, the two dominant peaks (100) and (200), corresponding
to the black phase of CsPbI3, have shown maximum crystallite
size for 36 μL HI additive. For 30 μL HI, the corresponding
crystallite sizes for all of the peaks were much smaller. The trend
in crystallite size shows the optimum value is 36 μL, moving
to either higher or lower HI concentrations causes a reduction. Figure 3 represents the microstrain
and dislocation density on the films deposited with various HI concentrations.
The presence of microstrain is visible from the peak splitting of
the (110) peak. From Figure 3, it is evident that the microstrain is maximum on the (110)
peak compared to all of the other peaks. However, for 36 μL
HI concentration, both the microstrain and dislocation density are
found to reduce drastically. Dislocation density indicates imperfection
in a crystal. The overall dislocation density values corresponding
to the dominant peaks of (100) and (200) are minimum for the HI concentration
of 36 μL.

Figure 2 Normalized peak intensity and crystallite size of CsPbI3 perovskite layers with various HI concentrations. The normalized
peak intensities are shown in the red bars and the crystallite sizes
are shown in the green bars.

Figure 3 Calculated microstrain and dislocation density of CsPbI3 perovskite layers with various HI concentrations. Microstrain and
dislocation density values are shown in the red and green colored
bars, respectively.

Figure 4 displays
the top-view scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the CsPbI3 layer grown on top of the PEDOT:PSS layer for different additive
concentrations. The difference in the morphologies observed from the
SEM micrographs is due to the variation in the HI additive concentration,
as all other deposition parameters and postdeposition annealing temperature
were fixed. For the lowest additive concentration (HI = 30 μL/mL)
from Figure 4a, poor
grain growth and nonuniform coverage along with pores can be observed.
This is attributed to a lack of HI, which hinders crystallization
at low temperatures. From Figure 4b, uniform coverage along with improved grain growth
can be observed. A few pinholes are visible from the image. The grain
morphology is further improved for the CsPbI3 layer formed
with 36 μL HI, which can be observed from Figure 4c with no visible pinholes or cracks. The
grain sizes are very small, on the scale of a few nanometers. This
finding correlates directly with the XRD measurements. Additionally,
these results are consistent with previous reports showing smaller
grain sizes for the CsPbI3 layer grown at lower temperature
(≈100 °C) with the aid of HI additives.28,35,36 Protesescu et al. demonstrated that the
stability in the black phase can be enhanced by smaller nanocrystals.50 Therefore, the smaller crystallites observed
from the SEM and XRD data are beneficial for attaining the black phase. Figure 4d,e depicts the grain
morphologies of the CsPbI3 layer deposited with 39 and
42 μL HI, respectively. The presence of numerous pinholes and
cracks clearly suggests that the quality of these films is not suitable
for an active layer in the photovoltaic devices. The increase in HI
concentration causes an increase of H2O in the precursor
solution state, which is unfavorable for perovskite formation46 since the HI used contains water (57 wt % in
H2O). Therefore, the addition of HI up to the optimized
amount is beneficial for grain growth. However, if the HI concentration
is further increased, the presence of water molecules is detrimental
for the perovskite layer. After observing the SEM images of CsPbI3 thin-film surfaces with different HI concentrations in Figure 4, it can be concluded
that the film deposited with 36 μL/mL HI concentration has shown
better surface morphology compared to other HI concentration in the
CsPbI3 precursor solution.

(SEM) images of CsPbI3 layer with various HI concentrations:
(a) 30 μL, (b)
33 μL, (c) 36 μL, (d) 39 μL, and (e) 42 μL
in the precursor solution.

The Tauc plot of CsPbI3 films is shown in Figure 5. The band gap energy
(Eg) of each film was calculated using
the following
equation51,52 6  where
α is the absorption coefficient, A is a constant, h is Planck’s constant,
υ is the frequency of the incident photon, and n is a constant, which is equal to 1 for direct band gap semiconductors
and 4 for indirect band gap semiconductors.51 For the 30 μL HI CsPbI3 film, the calculated Eg is 1.75 eV. This value is higher than what
is expected for the desired cubic phase configuration, which should
be ∼1.7 eV.28,32 Kim et al. showed that the yellow
phase of CsPbI3 possesses an Eg of 2.81 eV.36 The observation of Eg = 1.75 eV for the 30 μL film indicates
that this HI concentration is too low for the full formation of the
black phase. In the concentration range from 33 to 39 μL, the
extracted Eg is ∼1.7 eV, representative
of the fully formed CsPbI3 black phase. This finding correlates
with the crystallite sizes displayed in Figure 2. Further increasing HI concentration to
42 μL sees the Eg increase to 1.73
eV. It is believed that the change in Eg for the higher HI concentration is due to the detrimental influence
of water molecules incorporated in the HI. Deterioration in the perovskite
film quality with excess HI addition has also been previously observed
in the literature by Kim et al.53 and Wang
et al.46

Figure 5 Tauc plot for determining the bandgaps
of the CsPbI3 layer deposited with different HI additive
concentrations in the
precursor solution. The band gap energy was obtained by extrapolating
the straight-line portion of the graph to zero absorption coefficients.
The intercept on the energy axis indicates the value of band gap energy.

Figure 6 shows the
absorption spectra for CsPbI3 thin films. The 30 μL
HI CsPbI3 film has a shorter cut off wavelength and significantly
reduced absorption in the range from 500 to 700 nm. Increasing the
HI concentration leads to an increase in the cut off wavelength, and
an improvement in absorption in the range from 500 to 700 nm. This
absorption profile, indicative of the formation of the CsPbI3 black phase, is much more suitable for a photovoltaic absorber.
Increasing the HI concentration to 42 μL leads to a reduction
in the film absorption. This reduced absorption severely hinders the
amount of photocurrent, which can be generated in this film.

spectra of CsPbI3 perovskite layer deposited
with various HI additive concentrations in the precursor solution.

On the basis of the above discussions,
30 μL additives display
lower crystallinity, poor morphology, reduced absorption, and a higher
band gap. On the other hand, 42 μL HI additive has also shown
unfavorable results in terms of structural, morphological, and optical
properties. In the literature, HI concentration of 33 μL has
been employed widely by different groups.28,32,35,36 It appears
that the optimized amount lies between the concentrations of 33–39
μL. To validate the findings from the characterizations of single
layers, planar solar cells consisting of a ITO/PEDOT:PSS/CsPbI3-perovskite/PC71BM/Ag structure were fabricated.
The PCE, open circuit voltage (Voc), short
circuit current density (Jsc), and fill
factor (FF) of corresponding devices are shown with the box plots
in Figure 7. The average
values, calculated based on 10 devices, are presented in Table 1. The maximum average
efficiency is found for the solar cells consisting of the CsPbI3 layer deposited with 36 μL HI additive. Increasing
the concentration from 30 to 39 μL leads to an increase in Jsc, which correlates with the absorption data
shown in Figure 5.
The low Jsc observed for the 30 μL
case is related to the incomplete phase transition to the black phase.
The HI concentration above the 36 μL leads to a significant
reduction in Voc, which governs the optimum
concentration. As shown in the SEM images in Figure 4, these higher concentrations lead to the
formation of pinholes. The poor contact due to these pinholes may
cause the abrupt change in Voc. The J–V curves of the best devices fabricated
with various HI concentrations are shown in Figure 8.

a The data are average values of 10

The obtained solar cell parameters
have shown better values corresponding
to the perovskite layer with 36 μL HI additive concentration,
which is consistent with the previous findings in terms of XRD, SEM,
and optical characterizations. Therefore, it can be concluded that
36 μL can be used as an optimized amount for HI concentration
with the CsPbI3 perovskite layer.

Electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy measurements were performed
to study the charge-transport characteristics of all of the devices
based on various HI concentrations in the active layer. Figure 9 shows the Nyquist plots of
the CsPbI3 solar cells with different HI concentrations
with an applied bias of 0.6 V. The obtained Nyquist data exhibit distinct
semicircles, which were fitted with the equivalent circuit model shown
in the inset of Figure 9. All of the measurements were performed under dark conditions where
the internal resistance of the photovoltaic device consists of sheet
resistance and charge-transfer resistance. In the equivalent circuit, RSH represents the sheet resistance, which basically
consists of the ohmic resistance of the electrodes and the bulk resistance
of the active layer.36RCT corresponds to the charge transfer or interfacial resistance,
which is typically obtained from the diameter of the semicircle of
the Nyquist plot.54 The constant phase
element (CPE) represents the nonideal capacitor element of the photovoltaic
devices.55,56 The extracted equivalent circuit parameters
are given in Table 2. From Figure 9 the
devices with 36 μL HI have shown the smallest semicircle indicating
the lowest charge-transport resistance. The lowest value of RCT (from Table 2) corresponding to the devices with 36 μL HI
can be attributed to the better crystallinity, morphology,and higher
range of absorption confirmed from XRD, SEM, and UV–vis spectrometry,
respectively. The value of RCT for the
30 μL HI case is significantly higher. This high interfacial
resistance is attributed to the presence of the yellow phase at this
additive concentration. Additionally, the 42 μL HI also displays
much higher RCT compared to the optimum
concentration. This correlates well to the SEM results in Figure 4, which show the
presence of pinholes in this film. This poor contact may be responsible
for the significantly reduced Voc for
devices with this HI concentration. The RSH values are very close to each other indicating the fact that all
of the devices were prepared under the same conditions. The overall
values obtained for RSH, RCT, and capacitance are consistent to the literature.36,57

3 Conclusions
In summary, we investigated the influence of the HI additive concentration
on both the formation of CsPbI3 films and the performance
of CsPbI3 perovskite photovoltaic devices. The use of a
HI additive is crucial to facilitate the phase transition from the
undesirable orthorhombic or yellow phase to the cubic or black phase,
at temperatures amenable to low-cost production. At low HI concentrations
of 30 μL/mL, absorption and XRD measurements indicated the incomplete
phase transition to the black CsPbI3 phase. Correspondingly,
devices fabricated with these films displayed poor photovoltaic performance.
Increasing the HI concentration caused an improvement in the crystallinity
of the cubic phase as well improved optical and electrical properties.
The optimum HI concentration was found to be 36 μL/mL, which
is higher than the commonly used concentration of 33 μL/mL.
CsPbI3 perovskite photovoltaic devices fabricated using
this condition achieved a maximum efficiency of 6.45%. CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells are an excellent candidate for use as the
top cell in perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. These results provide
a further step toward the realization of this technology.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Device Fabrication
Patterned ITO
glass, purchased from Lumtec was used as the substrates. The substrates
were ultrasonically cleaned with Hellmanex III soap, deionized water,
acetone, and isopropanol sequence. Afterward, they were dried with
high-pure N2 gas. The PEDOT:PSS (Al4083, Ossila Ltd.) solution
was sonicated for 10 min and then filtered with a 0.45 μm poly(tetrafluoroethylene)
filter. Afterward, the PEDOT:PSS layer was formed on the cleaned substrates
via spin-coating at 4500 rpm for 30 s followed by annealing at 130
°C for 15 min. The substrates were then transferred inside a
N2-filled glovebox (<0.1 ppm of O2 and H2O). Five separate 0.48 M CsPbI3 precursor solutions
were made by adding cesium iodide (CsI, Sigma-Aldrich, >99.999%)
and
lead iodide (PbI2, Lumtec, >99.999%) in 1 mL N,N-dimethylformamide (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous)
solvent. Prior to deposition, various concentrations (30, 33, 36,
39, and 42 μL) of hydroiodic acid (HI, 57 wt % in H2O, Sigma-Aldrich, >99.99%) were added to the previously prepared
CsPbI3 precursor solutions. The perovskite layer was then
formed by spin-coating at 3500 rpm for 30 s and subsequent annealing
at 100 °C for 10 min inside the glovebox. For preparing the electron-transport
layer, [6,6]-phenyl C71 butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM, 1-Material, Inc., 20 mg/mL) was dissolved in cholorobenzene
(Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous). The PC71BM solution was spin-coated
at 3000 rpm for 30 s on top of the perovskite layer to form the electron-transport
layer. Finally, thermal evaporation was used to deposit a 100 nm Ag
layer with an evaporation rate of 2.0 Å/s under a vacuum condition
of 1 × 10–6 mBar.

4.2 Characterization
Current density–voltage
(J–V) measurements were performed
using a solar cell I–V testing
system from PV Measurements, Inc. with a Keithley 2400 source meter.
The light intensity was calibrated to 100 mW/cm2 intensity
with an AM 1.5G solar simulator. The structural and crystallographic
properties of the deposited films were studied with PANalytical Empyrean
thin-film XRD machine with Cu Kα radiation. The surface morphology
of the films was measured by scanning electron microscopy (FEI Nova
NanoSEM450) equipment. For optical characterization (transmittance,
reflectance, and absorbance) of the films, PerkinElmer Lambda 950
UV–vis–NIR spectrometer was used. The impedance analysis
was conducted with an Autolab PGSTAT-30 equipped with a frequency
analyzer module in the frequency range from 1 MHz to 1 Hz.
