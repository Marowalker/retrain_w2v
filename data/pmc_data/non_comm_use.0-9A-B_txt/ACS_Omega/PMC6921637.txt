Variable electronics are vital in tunable filters, transmitters,
and receivers, among other applications. In addition, the ability
to remotely tune soft capacitors, resistors, and inductors is important
for applications in which the device is not accessible. In this paper,
a uniform method of remotely tuning the characteristic properties
of soft electronic units (i.e. inductance, capacitance, and resistance)
is presented. In this method, magnetically actuated ferrofluid mixed
with iron powder is dragged in a soft fluidic channel made of polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) to tune the electrical properties of the component. The effects
of position and quantity of the ferrofluid and iron powder are studied
over a range of frequencies, and the changes in inductance, capacitance,
resistance, quality factor, and self-resonance frequency are reported
accordingly. The position plays a bigger role in changing inductance,
capacitance, and resistance. With the proposed design, the inductance
can be changed by 20.9% from 3.31 μH for planar inductors and
23% from 0.44 μH for axial inductors. In addition, the capacitance
of capacitors and impedance of resistors can be changed by 12.7% from
2.854 pF and 185.3% from 0.353 kΩ, respectively. Furthermore,
the changes in the inductance, capacitance, and resistance follow
“quasi-linear profiles” with the input during position
and quantity effect experiments.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Soft electronics is considered
to be a promising replacement for
traditional rigid circuits in specialized applications where flexibility,
stretchability, and biocompatibility are required. Current commercial
integration of soft electronics is limited, but the true measure of
this technology’s value lies in its potential. Improvements
in soft electronics will open doors in several fields. Soft robotics
will achieve mobility in highly confined spaces, passively distributing
stress to attain robots more robust to their environments.1−4

In particular, variable electronic components are vital to
applications
requiring any type of tuning. Variable resistors are extensively used
as control inputs to electronic circuits. Variable inductors can be
used for voltage regulation, in tuning the frequencies of inductively
coupled power transfer systems and power factor correction over long
distances.5−7 Variable capacitors can also be used for tuning the
resonance frequency and capacitive reactance of electrical circuits.8 In addition, variable components serve a vital
purpose in tunable filters, receivers, and transmitters.9,10 The addition of these functions will significantly enhance the toolbox
of soft electronic device designers.

Through the pursuit of
these functionalities, a variety of methods
have been developed for achieving soft electronic components and devices.
These methods fall into three categories: material innovation, structural
design,11 and mobile liquid conductors.
Through material innovation,12,13 researchers produced
conductive composite materials by depositing/embedding conductive
nanomaterials onto/within a stretchable substrate.14 The resulting composite material is characterized by the
conductive properties of the nanomaterial and the mechanical properties
of the substrate. Moreover, by using intrinsically stretchable materials
such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) doped with nickel, silver, or
R-GO microtubes, stretchable electronic devices can be developed.15 These intrinsically stretchable conductive materials
can be produced at a low cost because of their simple fabrication
process and are characterized by high integrity when stacked in layers.
In the structural design category,16−18 stretchable interconnects
such as waves,19,20 bridges,21 or meanders of a rigid conductor,22 conductor-filled
polymers,23 or microfluidic filled with
static liquid metals are used to achieve high electrical conductance
when bonded to or used in conjunction with stretchable substrates.
These stretchable substrates are usually composed of either an elastomeric
membrane,24 a net made of elastomer,25 or a stretched and flattened flex circuit polymer
foil.26 For instance, Gray et al. constructed
elastomeric electronics by embedding a common helical spring in an
elastomer using lithography techniques.27 In addition, using out of plane wavy geometries of solid conductor
strands embedded onto a prestrained elastomer substrate, Choi et al.
produced stretchable conductive composites. The effectiveness of this
method depends largely on the design of the waves and meander patterns
of the solid conductor.19

Besides
the abovementioned methods, liquid conductors have also
been used to develop soft electronic components and devices.28,29 In this category, development of soft electronics is aided by existing
research, concepts, and inventions in the field of microfluidics.
Microfluidics is the science of manipulating fluids at the micrometer
scale; when a conductive fluid is used, it represents a very viable
approach to creating soft, stretchable electronics at a similarly
small scale.

The emergence of microfluidics in soft electronics
opened a new
era, toward using fluids such as liquid metals in electronics. Microfluidic-based
electronics is a combination of well-established fields and has evolved
largely in the last two decades. Researchers demonstrated that in
addition to microfluidic electronic components made of static liquid
metal, mobile liquid metals can also be utilized in such components.
Jeon et al. used liquid metals with magnetic manipulation to make
electrical switches.30 In another study,
Wang et al. developed a reconfigurable liquid metal antenna driven
by electrochemically controlled capillarity.31

In addition to liquid metals, ferrofluids are also used for
microfluidic
electronic applications. Ferrofluid is made of ferromagnetic particles
suspended in a carrier fluid. The carrier fluid can be a water or
an organic solvent, and ferromagnetic particles are covered with a
surfactant to prevent them from clumping.32 The carrier fluid and surfactant can both be chosen from biocompatible
materials, as in commercially available biocompatible ferrofluids.
Micro-magnetofluidics is a subfield in microfluidics which studies
the use of ferrofluid and other types of magnetic fluids in microfluidic
environments. Micro-magnetofluidics has been successfully used for
flow control,33 particle sorting and separation,34 pumps and valves,35 micromixing and assaying,36 and droplet
formation.37 Although ferrofluids alone
are nonconductive, conductive liquid metal-based ferrofluids have
been produced.38−41

Currently, a few tunable microfluidic soft electronic components
have been designed and developed. Lazarus et al. devised a stretchable,
variable inductor with gallium-filled microfluidic channels in a silicone
elastomer and with a ferrofluid core and successfully tested it to
100% strain.42 Assadsangabi invented a
variable planar inductor using ferrofluid as a core and achieved variability
by manipulating the ferrofluid.43 In their
design, a second planar coil and a permanent magnet lie beneath the
inductor in order to manipulate the ferrofluid in a chamber above
the inductor. Polcar and Mayer devised a magnetically controllable
variable capacitor which uses ferrofluid as the dielectric medium.44 Using a magnetic field to manipulate the ferrofluid
dielectric between plates, a variable capacitance is achieved. Furthermore,
Liu et al. introduced a variable capacitor made of two stretchable
channels filled with liquid metals.45 Although
many of the previously developed microfluidic electronic components
are classified as stretchable, flexible, bendable, and/or variable,
no research to date presents a full trio of variable electrical components
that are tuned via a standardized method. Current variable soft electrical
components are variable but most of them require power to be continuously
applied in order to maintain a specific characteristic value. Furthermore,
many of these soft variable electronics must be directly adjusted
instead of being adjusted remotely.

In this paper, microfluidic
soft variable resistors, capacitors,
and inductors are presented, all with a standardized tuning method.
This method enables remote, magnetic tuning that does not expend power
to maintain a tuned characteristic value. The proposed method for
tuning the characteristics of the electrical components is based on
the effect of a mobile component, which travels through a soft channel.
By choosing the mobile component from magnetically responsive materials,
it can be actuated using a magnetic field remotely. Having this in
mind, ferrofluid is chosen as the mobile component of the proposed
stretchable variable electronic units. Additionally, using iron particles
as well as mixture of iron particles and ferrofluid is explored as
alternatives. This study, explores the effects of volume of ferrofluid,
mass of iron, and different ratios of their mixture, in different
positions inside the channel with and without a magnet on the characteristics
of each electronic unit. In particular, a vector network analyzer
(VNA) is used to measure the effect of the mobile component on inductance,
quality-factor (Q-factor), and self-resonance frequency
(SRF) of the inductors, capacitance, Q-factor, and
SRF of capacitors, and impedance of the resistors.

2 Results and Discussion
In this section,
the effect of quantity (cases 1–4; as described
in section 4.2.1) and position (cases 5–9; as described in section 4.2.2) of the mobile components
on inductance, Q-factor, and SRF of the inductors;
capacitance, Q-factor, and SRF of capacitors; and
impedance of the resistors are discussed in detail.

2.1 Inductors
Tables 1 and 2 illustrate
the results of both position-effect and quantity-effect experiments
with the planar and axial inductors, respectively. Among planar inductors,
as can be seen in Table 1, case (3) among the quantity-effect and case (7) among the position-effect
experiments achieved the broadest tuning range for inductance [2.9%
for case (3) and 20.9% for case (7)]. In this table, the inductance
is measured at a frequency of 10 MHz.

a The inductances are measured at
a frequency of 10 MHz and Q-factors at the peak.
Minimum, maximum, and the standard error of the mean are calculated
based on the data collected from three planar inductors with the same
design. The inductances are in μH and the self-resonance frequencies
are in MHz. Cases studied in quantity-effect experiments include changing
the mass of iron without the magnet being present (case (1)), changing
the mass of iron with the magnet being present (case (2)), changing
the mass of iron with the magnet and ferrofluid being present (case
(3)), and changing the volume of ferrofluid with the magnet being
present (case (4)). Cases studied in position-effect experiments include
moving iron without the magnet being present (case (5)), iron with
the magnet being present (case (6)), a mixture of iron and ferrofluid
with the magnet being present (case (7)), ferrofluid with the magnet
being present (case (8)), and only the magnet (case (9)).

b Case (7) offers the broadest tuning
range for inductance among the planar inductors evaluated in this
study.

a The inductances are measured at
a frequency of 10 MHz and Q-factors at the peak.
Minimum, maximum, and the standard error of the mean are calculated
based on the data collected from three different axial inductors of
cross section 3 mm × 3 mm with the same design. The inductances
are in μH and the self-resonance frequencies are in MHz. Cases
studied in quantity-effect experiments include changing the mass of
iron without the magnet being present (case (1)), changing the mass
of iron with the magnet being present (case (2)), changing the mass
of iron with the magnet and ferrofluid being present (case (3)), and
changing the volume of ferrofluid with the magnet being present (case
(4)). Cases studied in position-effect experiments include moving
iron without the magnet being present (case (5)), iron with the magnet
being present (case (6)), a mixture of iron and ferrofluid with the
magnet being present (case (7)), ferrofluid with the magnet being
present (case (8)), and only the magnet (case (9)).

b Case (7) offers the broadest tuning
range for inductance among the axial inductors evaluated in this study.

For the axial inductors, case (4) among the quantity-effect
and
case (7) among the position-effect experiments are the most successful
in increasing inductance [increase of 16.33% for case (4) and 23%
for case (7)]. From the figures and measurements, it can be concluded
that for all of the planar and axial inductors explored in this study,
moving the mobile component results in more significant changes in
inductance than changing its quantity. In Table 2, the inductance is measured at a frequency
of 1.5 MHz and the Q-factor at the peak.

The
spectral magnitude and spectral phase of the inductors are
illustrated in the Supporting Information. As is clear in each phase plot, the phase switches sign at the
SRF. The nonlinear behavior of magnitude at frequencies approaching
zero is due to a limit of the VNA.

The changes in characteristics
of the planar and axial inductors
under the position and quantity effects are due to the relation of
inductance and the magnetic permeability of the material in proximity
to the inductor. The increase in permeability is due to the introduction
and incremental addition of iron particles and ferrofluid (ferromagnetic
materials) to the inductor, both having relative permeability greater
than one. In cases (1–4), different concentrations of iron
particles and ferrofluid are used. By increasing the amount of iron
particles or ferrofluid, the effect on the inductance is increased.
In cases (5–8), moving the mobile component to the core of
the inductors causes the maximum effect. The differences in the level
of effectiveness between cases using iron particles [case (1–3)
and (5–7)] and cases using ferrofluid [cases (4) and (8)] are
due to the lower concentration of ferrite particles in the ferrofluid.
In case (9), bringing the magnet close to the inductor disrupts its
magnetic field lines and changes the permeability of space proximal
to the inductor, which alters the unit’s inductance.

The Q-factor relates the stored energy in the
inductor to the dissipated energy, which is typically defined as the
ratio of the reactance value to the equivalent resistance value at
a given frequency, using a narrow-band approximation approach. The
maximum observed change in Q-factor of planar inductors
is 8.5% in quantity-effect experiments [case (2)] and 39% in position-effect
experiments [case (7)]. In Table 1, the Q-factor is measured at its
peak point. Inductance and Q-factor of case (7) are
plotted over the frequency range of 0.3–70 MHz in Figure 1a. The effect of
position and quantity of the mobile components on three planar inductors
is plotted in Figures S3–S5 in the Supporting Information.

Figure 1 Experiments with the most significant change in the tuning
range
for (a) planar inductor, (b) axial inductor, (c) capacitor, and (d)
resistor.

Regarding Q-factor of axial inductors
(Table 2), of quantity-effect
experiments, the maximum change is 99% in case (2) and of position-effect
experiments, the maximum change is 119% in case (7). Inductance and Q-factor of case (7) are plotted over the frequency range
of 0.3–200 MHz in Figure 1b. In addition, the effect of position and quantity
of the mobile component on three axial inductors is plotted in Figures
S6–S8 in the Supporting Information.

It is known that an increase in the inductance results in
an increase
in stored energy, and thus an increase in Q-factor
is expected. Over all experiments, the changes in inductance are greater
in cases (5–9); Q-factor similarly experiences
larger changes in these cases, as compared to cases (1–4).
However, Q-factor does not linearly change with respect
to inductance. Additionally, the presence of a ferrite core can increase
the loss and decrease the Q-factor to some extent.
As a result of these competing factors, the net change observed in
the Q-factor is moderate.

SRF is also affected
by changing either the position or quantity
of the mobile components. For planar inductors (Table 1), the quantity of the mobile component has
a minimal impact on SRF (less than 4%), while its position change
results in shifting the SRF more significantly [7.3% for case (9)
and 9.4% for case (8)]. For axial inductors (Table 2), case (4) induced the greatest shift in
SRF among quantity-effect experiments (8.46%) and among position-effect
experiments, case (7) shifts the SRF more significantly (9.36%). SRF
of an inductor is inversely proportional to the value of the inductance;
therefore a decrease in SRF is expected from an increase in the inductance
value of the component.

2.2 Capacitors
The results of both position-effect
and quantity-effect experiments for capacitors are detailed in Table 3. In this table, both
the capacitance and Q-factor are measured at a frequency
of 243 MHz. Results of the experiments conducted on capacitors are
plotted in Figures S9–S11 in the Supporting Information. In addition, the spectral magnitude and spectral
phase of the capacitors are also plotted in the Supporting Information.

a The capacitances and Q-factors are measured at a frequency of 243 MHz. Minimum, maximum,
and the standard error of the mean are calculated based on the data
collected from three different capacitors with the same design. The
capacitances are in pF and the self-resonance frequencies are in MHz.
Cases studied in quantity-effect experiments include changing the
mass of iron without the magnet being present (case (1)), changing
the mass of iron with the magnet being present (case (2)), changing
the mass of iron with the magnet and ferrofluid being present (case
(3)), and changing the volume of ferrofluid with the magnet being
present (case (4)). Cases studied in position-effect experiments include
moving iron without the magnet being present (case (5)), iron with
the magnet being present (case (6)), a mixture of iron and ferrofluid
with the magnet being present (case (7)), ferrofluid with the magnet
being present (case (8)), and only the magnet (case (9)).

b Case (6) offers the broadest tuning
range for capacitance among the capacitors evaluated in this study.

In resemblance to the inductor experiments, it is
found that for
the capacitors explored in this study, moving the mobile component
results in more significant tunability of capacitance than changing
its quantity. Of the position-effect experiments, case (6) produces
the greatest tuning range of capacitance (increase of 12.7%), and
of the quantity-effect experiments, case (2) is the most effective
scenario for tuning of capacitance (increase of 6.5%). Capacitance
and Q-factor of case (6) are plotted over the frequency
range of 0.3–1200 MHz in Figure 1c.

In cases (1–3) and (5–7), iron
particles conglomerate
inside the channels near the magnet resulting in a conductive clustered
medium. Considering the thin layer of PDMS between the clustered iron
particle medium and each plate, this electronic unit can be conceptualized
as two capacitors in series. The total capacitance decreases as the
conductive medium grows larger in area. This increase in area is facilitated
by either changing the amount of iron particles between the capacitor
electrodes through adding more iron particles [cases (1–3)]
or moving the mobile component further toward the center of the capacitor’s
plates [cases (5–7)]. This effect is more significant in the
presence of the magnet in cases (2) and (6), as the iron particles
under the influence of the magnetic field are more closely forced
together between the capacitor plates. This increases the amount of
mobile component material between the plates, leaving fewer and smaller
air gaps in the conductive cluster in comparison to cases (1) and
(5). In cases (3) and (7), using ferrofluid along with iron particles
shows counter effects or only moderate changes: the variations in
capacitance are smaller in these cases compared to cases (2) and (6),
in which ferrofluid is not used. Small effects on capacitance seen
in cases (4) and (8) are due to the small dielectric permittivity
of ferrofluid which is close to that of air.

Maximum Q-factor change in quantity-effect studies
is 36.6% in case (2). Of position-effect experiments, maximum Q-factor change is 53% in case (8). For capacitors, the
changes in Q-factor are due to changes in the ratio
of stored to dissipated energy. This relation is formulated in eq 5 showing that through an
increase in the capacitance, the Q-factor decreases.
In cases (5–7), moving the iron particles between the plates
results in a decrease in the capacitance and thus, an increase in
the Q-factor. This relation is not linear, as iron
particles introduce conduction losses which decrease the Q-factor. In cases (3–4 and 7–8), ferrofluid acts as
a dielectric and introduces dielectric loss. Therefore, the net change
in the Q-factor is subdued.

With regards to
the SRF of capacitors, the results indicate that
the change in the amount of the mobile component has only a slight
effect on the SRF (less than 9%) while the position of the mobile
component causes a more significant shift in the SRF (up to 16%) (Figure
S9 in the Supporting Information). SRF
of capacitors is inversely proportional to the value of the capacitance.
Because the capacitance experiences bigger changes during position-effect
experiments, SRF will undergo a more significant shift in these experiments
as well.

2.3 Resistors
Figure S12a in the Supporting Information shows that the circuit
is open when using the mobile component comprised of iron powder without
a magnet, as the resistance is too high regardless of the iron mass.
Likewise, Figure S12b illustrates that
the ferrofluid used in these experiments is not electrically conductive.
These results reduce the number of possible experiments which may
have an impact on the impedance to four different cases: changing
the mass of iron with the magnet being present (case (1)), changing
the volume of ferrofluid mixed with iron particles and magnet being
present (case (2)), changing the position of iron particles with the
magnet (case (3)), and changing the position of iron particles mixed
with ferrofluid using a magnet (case (4)). The results of these experiments
are shown in Figures S12c–f, S13, and S14 in the Supporting Information over the frequency range
of 0.3–450 MHz.

Figure S12c illustrates that by adding more iron powder under the influence
of the magnet (case (1)), the resistance of the mobile component drops.
This is due to the alignment of iron particles along the magnetic
field direction of two magnets with the configuration shown in Figure 3c, which bridges
two wires and connects the circuit. By increasing the amount of iron,
the surface area of the mobile component connecting the two wires
increases, which leads to a better conductivity. Figure S12d (case
(2)) in the Supporting Information shows
a slight improvement in the conductivity of the mobile component on
adding ferrofluid to it. Adding ferrofluid to iron particles enhances
the particles alignment which is likely the reason of slight improvement
in conductivity of the mobile component in case (2). Figure S12e (case (3)) illustrates the change in the impedance
by moving the mobile component in different positions. This is due
to different numbers of resistors being included in the circuit. Finally, Figure S12f (case (4)) shows that adding ferrofluid
to the mobile component can improve the result of the position experiment
slightly.

Table 4 contains
the results of both position-effect and quantity-effect experiments
for resistors. The impedance of the resistors is measured at 692 kHz.
According to the data, the iron amount (case (1)) has more influence
on the conductivity of the mobile component than ferrofluid volume
(case (2)). Furthermore, in the position-effect experiments, the resistance
of mobile component in case (4) is less than case (3).

experiments include changing the mass of iron with the magnet being
present (case (1)) and changing the volume of ferrofluid mixed with
iron particles and magnet being present (case (2)). Cases studied
in position-effect experiments include changing the position of iron
particles with the magnet (case (3)) and changing the position of
iron particles mixed with ferrofluid using a magnet (case (4)).

range for impedance among the resistors evaluated in this study.

3 Conclusion
In this paper, we propose
a uniform method to add tunability to
soft electronic units including inductors, capacitors, and resistors.
This method changes the characteristics of soft electronic units using
a mobile component moving in a fluidic channel. The effects of both
position and quantity of the mobile components on electrical characteristics
of each circuit element were fully explored. The results show that
the position of the mobile component has more impact on changing the
characteristics of the electronic unit. In particular, we show that
the inductance of planar inductors can change up to 20.9% from 3.31
μH by using a mixture of iron and ferrofluid as the mobile component
with the magnet being present, the inductance of axial inductors up
to 23% from 0.44 μH by utilizing a mixture of iron and ferrofluid
as the mobile component with the magnet being present, the capacitance
of capacitors up to 12.7% from 2.854 pF under the influence of iron
particles as the mobile component with the magnet being present, and
impedance of resistors up to 185.3% from 0.353 kΩ by moving
the mobile component made of iron particles. In addition, it is shown
that the Q-factor of planar inductors changes up
to 39% from 19.1, axial inductors up to 119% from 27.3, and capacitors
up to 53% from 15.5. The changes in the inductance, capacitance, and
resistance follow “quasi-linear profiles” with the input
during position and quantity effect experiments. This means that the
mobile component can be encapsulated inside the channel and actuated
remotely to tune the characteristics of an electronic unit. Moreover,
the possibility of using different mixing ratios of iron particles
and ferrofluid can provide different tuning ranges and thus different
tuning resolutions for the same displacement of the mobile component.
This technique can be used for developing tunable electronics with
wide tuning ranges (e.g. filters, receivers, and transmitters) for
a variety of applications.

4 Methods
This study is conducted on
resistors, capacitors, and two types
of inductors (i.e. one planar inductor and one axial inductor). Three
samples of each type are fabricated for data collection. In this section,
fabrication processes, experiments, measurements, and calculations
are discussed.

4.1 Electronic Units Fabrication
All
of the units proposed in this study have three main components: a
fluidic channel, an electrical component, and a mobile component.
Fabrication of each of these components is described in details in
the following.

4.1.1 Fluidic Channel
Fluidic channels
are designed to contain the mobile component and provide it with a
path to move through. These channels are made of PDMS and are fabricated
using soft lithography.46 The PDMS used
for channel fabrication is Dow and Corning’s Sylgard 184, with
the mixing ratio of 1:10.

3D printing is used to fabricate the
negative channel patterns. After printing the molds, silicone oil
is applied to the surface for ease of demolding. The oil is left on
the surface for 1 min, then the excess is lightly blown off, and the
mold is put on the hot plate at 90 °C for 10 min. After mixing,
the air bubbles trapped in PDMS are released using a vacuum chamber
(degassing), and then it is poured into the molds and degassed again.
Finally, the molds are placed on a hot plate set to 90 °C for
3 h. Planar coils and resistors (Figure 2a,d) have the same design of channels; first,
the channel walls are fabricated out of PDMS. Then, these walls are
mounted on a glass slide to complete the channel. Although this can
similarly be done by using a layer of PDMS instead of a glass slide,
the focus of this study is not on the effect of stretching or twisting
the channel. Therefore, glass slides are chosen to eliminate any coupled
effects due to unwanted deformation of the channels during the experiments.
These channels are 70 mm long, 15 mm wide, and 10 mm deep with the
wall thickness of 7 mm on the sides and 4 mm at both ends.

Figure 2 (a) Soft planar
inductor placed on the 3D printed mount; a magnet
installed on the slider can be stopped at the desired positions using
the positioning fixture. (b) Axial inductor, (c) capacitor, and (d)
resistor placed on the mount. P1, P2, and P3 indicate different positions
of the mobile component during position-effect experiments.

Axial inductors (Figure 2b) are made in two steps: in the first step,
a thin wall channel
with 0.5 mm thickness is fabricated and copper wire is wound around
it; a 3D printed cubic core is placed inside the channel to reinforce
the thin layered PDMS and prevent any deformations during wire winding.
In the second step, the channel and the coil go through another PDMS
casting process to add 2 mm thickness to the walls of the channel.
Using this method, the channel’s walls are thick enough to
prevent them from deformation during the experiments. In addition,
the inductor is close enough to the inner surface of the channel.
These channels are 40 mm long with a cross section of 3 mm ×
3 mm. The process of fabricating axial inductors is illustrated in
the Supporting Information (Figure S24).

The channel walls for the capacitors (Figure 2c) are made with PDMS using soft lithography
technique and then attached to glass slides. Designing for a parallel
plate capacitor, two slot gaps of 10 mm × 7 mm are considered
on each side of the channel with 2.5 mm distance between them. These
channels are 1.5 mm wide, 5 mm deep, and 152 mm long (the total loop
length).

4.1.2 Electrical Components
The electrical
components used in each unit are made of copper wires and copper plates.
Although one can use liquid metals instead of copper to achieve more
flexible and stretchable components, that is beyond the scope of this
study.

For fabricating the planar inductor units, Mouser Electronics
wireless charging coils WE-WPCC are used. We removed 10 rounds of
wire from these coils to bring the SRF of the inductor (the frequency
at which the parasitic capacitance of an inductor resonates with its
inductance) to VNA’s frequency range. These coils are attached
to the bottom of the glass slides.

For the axial inductor units,
copper wire of 28 gauge is wound
around the channels over the length of 5 mm. The capacitor units are
made of 10 mm × 7 mm copper plates embedded in the channel’s
slots. The resistor units are made of two parallel wires, each of
which connects a series of resistors (Figure 2d). The conductive mobile component moves
over both wires and connects them to make a closed circuit. Moving
the mobile component back and forth on the wires changes the resistance
as different number of resistors can be included in the circuit. A
26 gauge copper wire is used for connecting the series of resistors,
and the second wire is 22 gauge. Three 330 Ω surface mounted
device (SMD) resistors with 20 mm distance from each other are embedded
in the unit. To obtain a continuous change in resistance, one can
replace the copper wire and resistors with a high-resistance material.

4.1.3 Mobile Component
The mobile component
is placed inside the channels and adds variability to each electrical
unit. All the mobile components used in this study are magnetically
responsive materials; thus, they can be controlled remotely while
encapsulated in the channel. In this study, CMS Magnetics iron powder
filings, Educational Innovation FF-310 bulk ferrofluid, and a mixture
of both are used as the mobile component. To elaborate on the mixed
mobile component, ferrofluid or iron powder (depending on the experiment)
is simply combined while inside the channel. Ferrofluid is added using
a pipette and the iron powder with a funnel. Further discussion of
the mobile component can be found in the following sections and in Table 5. Permanent magnets
are used as part of the actuation mechanism of the mobile component
inside the channels.

a For magnet + iron + ferrofluid,
iron mass is changed for inductors and capacitors and ferrofluid volume
is changed for the resistors. The ferrofluid volume is 500 μL
for the planar inductor and 40 μL for the axial inductor. In
addition, the iron mass used for resistors under this case (magnet
+ iron + ferrofluid) is 0.447 ± 0.013 g.

b Denotes the iron mass and ferrofluid
volume used for position-effect studies.

Besides moving the mobile component in the channel,
the magnet
retains it in place after achieving the desired position. The choice
of magnets and their configurations depend on the unit under study
(Figure 3). For axial inductors, an axially magnetized ring
magnet of NdFeB, Grade N42 with the outer diameter of 19 mm, the inner
diameter of 9.5 mm, and thickness of 3.2 mm is used. This magnet slides
up and down the inductor to achieve different positions for the mobile
component. A block magnet of NdFeB, Grade N42 with dimensions of 19
mm × 9.5 mm × 6.35 mm magnetized through its thickness is
used for the planar inductors and capacitors. Two of the same block
magnets are used for resistors. The configurations of these magnets
with respect to the channels are shown in Figure 3. A 3D printed position fixture is used for
consistent positioning of magnets (Figure 2).

respect to the channels.
(a) Axial magnetized ring magnet surrounding a channel is used for
axial inductors. (b) For planar inductors and capacitors, a single
block magnet is placed such that both poles touch the channel. (c)
Two magnet blocks attached to each other are used for the resistors.

4.2 Experiments
Experiments are conducted
in two different categories to explore the effect of position and
quantity of the mobile component on the characteristics of the electrical
units. In particular, inductance, capacitance, resistance, Q-factor, and SRF of the units are measured for different
positions and quantities of the mobile component.

4.2.1 Quantity Effect
For the quantity-effect
study, the amount of iron particles and ferrofluid volume are varied.
For these measurements, the mobile component is placed at the center
of the planar inductors, inside the axial inductors, between the plates
for the capacitors, or between the first and the second SMD resistors.
The four cases for this study are changing the mass of iron without
the magnet being present (case (1)), changing the mass of iron with
the magnet being present (case (2)), changing the mass of iron with
the magnet and ferrofluid being present (case (3)), and changing the
volume of ferrofluid with the magnet being present (case (4)). The
amount of ferrofluid and iron used in these experiments are listed
in Table 5.

4.2.2 Position Effect
For the position-effect
study, the mobile component is moved to three different positions.
These positions for each of the units are as follows. For planar inductor
units, the mobile component is moved to (1) the center of the electrical
component (P1), (2) its edge (P2), and (3) 50 mm from the center of
it (P3). For axial inductor units, it is moved to (1) inside the electrical
component (P1), (2) its edge (P2), and (3) 15 mm from the center of
it (P3). For capacitor units, the mobile component is moved to (1)
between the plates of the electrical component (P1), (2) its edge
(P2), and (3) 30 mm from the center of those (P3). For resistor units,
the three different positions of the mobile component correspond to
having one (P1), two (P2), or three (P3) SMD resistors in the circuit.
These positions are shown in Figure 2.

The iron mass and ferrofluid volume used for
position-effect studies are highlighted in Table 5. The five different cases explored for this
study include moving iron without the magnet being present (case (5)),
iron with the magnet being present (case (6)), a mixture of iron and
ferrofluid with the magnet being present (case (7)), ferrofluid with
the magnet being present (case (8)), and only the magnet (case (9)).

4.3 Measurements
Measurements are conducted
using an Agilent 8712ES VNA (Figure S2 in Supporting Information). The frequency range is kept the same for all
three samples of each electronic unit but different between units.
The scattering parameter indicating the reflection coefficient on
port 1, S11, is measured using one port
measurement. The effect of cables and connections are carefully de-embedded
using the built-in feature of the instrument and by separate measurements.
The intermediate frequency bandwidth for all measurements is set to
250 Hz.

4.4 Calculations
Using the S11 parameter, the impedance parameter, Z, can be calculated using eq 1. 1  where Z0 is the
characteristic impedance of VNA on port 1 (50 Ω in this case).

After obtaining Z-parameters over the frequency
(f) range, inductance (L), capacitance
(C), and Q-factor for each (QL and QC, respectively)
can be expressed using eqs 2–5, respectively. 2   3   4   5  where XL and XC are the reactances (imaginary part of the Z-parameters) of the inductor and the capacitor, respectively. r is the equivalent series resistance of the component and
ω is the resonance frequency.47
