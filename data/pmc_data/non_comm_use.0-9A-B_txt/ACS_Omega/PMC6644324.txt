The
Na−β-alumina battery (NBB) is one of the most
promising energy storage technologies for integrating renewable energy
resources into the grid. In the family of NBBs, Na–NiCl2 battery has been extensively studied during the past decade
because it has a lower operating temperature, better safety, and good
battery performance. One of the major issues with the Na–NiCl2 battery is material cost, which is primarily from Ni metal
in the battery cathode. As an alternative, Zn is much cheaper than
Ni, and replacing Ni with Zn in the cathode can significantly reduce
the cost. In this work, we investigate the performance and reaction
mechanism for a Na–ZnCl2 battery at 190 °C.
Two-step reversible reactions are identified. During the first step
of charging, NaCl reacts with Zn to produce a ribbon-type Na2ZnCl4 layer. This layer is formed at the NaCl–Zn
interface rather than covering the surface of the Zn particles, which
leads to an excellent cell rate capability. During the second step,
the produced Na2ZnCl4 is gradually consumed
to form ZnCl2 on the surface of Zn particles. The formed
ZnCl2 covers most of the surface area of the Zn particles
and shows a limited rate capability compared to that of the first
step. We conclude that this limited performance of the second step
is due to the passivation of Zn particles by ZnCl2, which
blocks the electron pathway of the NaCl–Zn cathodes.

Introduction
Electrochemical energy storage systems
or rechargeable batteries
have gained increasing attention for both stationary and transportation
applications during the past two decades.1,2 Among
various types of storage technologies, Na−β-alumina batteries
(NBBs) based on a β″-Al2O3 solid
electrolyte (BASE) and a molten sodium anode have been widely studied.1,3−6 There are two main types of NBBs based on the particular cathode
materials. One is the sodium–sulfur (Na–S) battery with
molten sulfur/polysulfides as the cathode material.3 The other one is sodium–metal halide (Na–MH
or ZEBRA) batteries, in which a solid transition metal halide (e.g.,
NiCl2 or FeCl2) is used in the cathode.4,5,7−12 A secondary molten electrolyte of NaAlCl4 (melting point
of 157 °C) is typically employed in the Na–MH batteries.
The molten electrolyte primarily serves as a sodium ion transport
medium between the BASE and the reaction zone in the cathode and does
not participate in the electrochemical reactions.

In conventional
Na–MH batteries, one critical requirement
for the cathode material is that electrochemically active species
in the cathode must be insoluble in the NaAlCl4 melt. Therefore,
mass transport of the species to the BASE surface and the subsequent
ion exchange with sodium in the BASE could be prevented. Among all
transition metal halides, NiCl2 has been extensively studied
primarily because it offers simple cell reactions, good cell voltage,
and lower solubility in the NaAlCl4 melt.7,9,13−15 For example,
with additives such as sodium bromide, sodium iodide, and sulfur,
the solubility of NiCl2 in the melt can be reduced to the
parts per million level at temperatures of ∼300 °C, which
can effectively hinder the ion exchange of Ni2+ with Na+ in the BASE and extend battery cycle life.16 Aside from these benefits, one of the major issues with
the Na–NiCl2 battery is material cost. According
to our previous study, cell material represents 39% of the overall
battery cost, and 63% of the cell material cost comes from Ni metal.
So, the cost of Ni metal is ∼25% of the overall battery cost.11

Replacing Ni with other low-cost metals,
such as Fe or Zn, would
significantly reduce the battery cost.11,12 For example,
the cost of Zn is ∼10% of that of Ni. Owing to the lower material
cost, various Zn-based rechargeable batteries, including Zn/MnO2 batteries in mild aqueous17 and
alkaline solutions18 Zn/Prussian blue analogue
batteries, Zn–I2 batteries19−22 and Zn-ion intercalating anode
battery23 have been extensively studied
for stationary energy storage applications. Based on our calculation,
replacing Ni with Zn in the Na–NiCl2 cathode can
cut around 46 and 20% of the cell material and overall battery costs,
respectively.11 Recently, our group has
expended a lot of effort to explore the possibility of using Fe or
Zn to replace Ni in the cathode. We demonstrated that a Na–FeCl2 battery can be assembled in a discharged state by adding
sulfur-based additives to the cathode. It was found that the polysulfide
species generated in situ during the initial charging process can
activate the Fe cathode via removing the passivation oxide layers
on the surface of Fe powders.12

For
the Na–ZnCl2 system, we have successfully
demonstrated cell performance at temperatures of 240 and 280 °C.11 Here, we further investigated its performance
at a reduced temperature of 190 °C. Reducing the temperature
below 200 °C is meaningful for Na–MH batteries because
it could significantly improve the battery durability and safety and
allow cost-effective materials for the battery components (e.g., sealing
and casing)15,24 and battery manufacturing/maintenance,
which eventually will lower the overall cost of the battery system.25 In this study, the relationship between cell
performance (e.g., capacity and rate capability), cathode microstructure
(e.g., particle size, morphology, and distribution), and electrochemical
reactions was thoroughly evaluated at the reduced operating temperature.
The performance of Na–ZnCl2 cells is also compared
with that of Na–NiCl2 cells. On the basis of the
observed results, cathode reaction mechanisms for the Na–ZnCl2 cell are proposed at the end of this study.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1a shows
the performance of a Na–ZnCl2 cell at 190 °C
compared with that of a Na–NiCl2 cell under similar
conditions. For the Na–ZnCl2 cell, two steps with
two plateaus were observed in the voltage profile, which was similar
to those at the operating temperature of 240 °C.11 A phase diagram between NaCl and ZnCl2 is shown
in Figure 1b.26,27 Three different solid phases appear in the phase diagram at 190
°C, including NaCl, Na2ZnCl4 (at a ZnCl2 mole fraction of 0.33), and solid ZnCl2. Accordingly,
the phase diagram can be divided into two different regions: (i) ZnCl2 mole fraction of 0 to 0.33, NaCl + Na2ZnCl2; and (ii) ZnCl2 mole fraction of 0.33 to 1, Na2ZnCl2 + ZnCl2, which appeared as the
two plateaus in the cell charging/discharging curve in Figure 1a. Similar to our previous
study, two reversible electrochemical reactions were proposed in conjunction
with the two steps (two plateaus): 1   2

To confirm the formation of these phases during
the electrochemical
reactions, XRD analysis was carried out for the cathodes of four cells
in which charging was stopped at 0, 25, 50, and 100% states of charges
(SOCs; see the arrows in Figure 1a). Figure 2 shows the XRD patterns for these cathodes. As shown in Figure 2a, the peaks from
NaCl, Ni, and NaAlCl4 were observed in the cathode at 0%
SOC. At 25% SOC, Na2ZnCl4 was detected, and
the existence of Na2ZnCl4 and absence of ZnCl2 confirmed that Na2ZnCl4, rather than
ZnCl2, formed during this stage of charging (step 1). At
50% SOC, however, the peaks from NaCl disappeared, indicating that
all of the active NaCl has been converted to Na2ZnCl4 and the active materials in the cathode were Na2ZnCl4 and Zn at this point. After 50% SOC, the Na2ZnCl4 was gradually consumed with the production
of ZnCl2, and the final products in the cathode consisted
of ZnCl2 and Zn. It should be noted that an excessive amount
of Zn is typically incorporated into the battery cathode as electron
percolation paths, which can ensure sufficient electrical conductivity
throughout the charging/discharging processes. It can explain why
the intensity of Zn metal peaks was so strong even at the end of charge,
as seen in Figure 2d. According to the abovementioned two electrochemical reactions,
the NaCl utilization rates at the end of each step were 50 and 100%,
respectively, which exactly matched the steps appearing in the charging/discharging
curve in Figure 1a.

Figure 2 XRD patterns

at different SOCs: (a) 0, (b) 25, (c) 50, and (d) 100%.

To test the rate capability, the Na–ZnCl2 cell
was operated at different charging/discharging rates. The performance
of the cell was also compared with that of the Na–NiCl2 cell as shown in Figure 3a. At a charging/discharging current of 20 mA, the
capacities of the Na–ZnCl2 cell were similar to
those of Na–NiCl2 cells (i.e., ∼149 mAh).
With the increase of the charging/discharging rate, the capacities
for both cells decreased significantly. However, the capacity retention
of the Na–ZnCl2 cell was significantly higher. For
example, the capacities for the Na–ZnCl2 and Na–NiCl2 cells were 110 and 102 mAh at a current of 60 mA, respectively.
At a current of 100 mA, the retentions were 61 (96 mAh) and 41% (64
mAh) for the Na–ZnCl2 and Na–NiCl2 cells, respectively. Apparently, the performance of the Na–ZnCl2 cell at higher charging/discharging rates was superior to
that of the Na–NiCl2 cell. To investigate the mechanism
responsible for the superior performance of the Na–ZnCl2 cell at higher charging/discharging rates, the voltage profiles
of the cell at different currents were compared with those of the
Na–NiCl2 cell in Figure 3b–d. As shown in Figure 3b, at a constant current of
20 mA, the capacities of Na–NiCl2 were ∼94%
of the theoretical one. For the Na–ZnCl2 cell, they
were around 96% of the theoretical one, with 46% of the capacities
from step 1 and the other 50% from step 2. When the current was increased
to 60 mA, the capacities of the Na–NiCl2 cell were
65% of the theoretical value, whereas they were 42 and 28% for the
first and second steps in the Na–ZnCl2 cell, respectively.
At a constant current of 100 mA, the Na–NiCl2 cell
retained 41% of the theoretical capacity, and the capacities were
38 and 23% for the Na–ZnCl2 cell. These results
along with the capacities at other currents are summarized in Figure 3e. For the Na–ZnCl2 cell, the capacity retention rates for steps 1 and 2 were
close to each other at a low current of 20 mA, which was also very
similar to that of the Na–NiCl2 cell. However, the
retention rate (−0.11 in slope) for step 1 was significantly
higher than that of step 2 (−0.34 in slope) at the higher currents.
The major difference between the two steps is the reaction product
(i.e., Na2ZnCl4 vs ZnCl2). Thus,
we believe that the higher rate capability for step 1 was related
to the formation of Na2ZnCl4. More discussions
will be presented with other characterization techniques (e.g., electrochemical
impedance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)) in
the following section.

the Na–ZnCl2 and Na–NiCl2 cells.

Figure 4 shows the
impedance spectra of the Na–ZnCl2 cells stopped
at different SOCs (e.g., 0, 25, 50, and 100%). All the spectra had
one depressed semicircle at high frequencies and one straight line
at lower frequencies. The high-frequency semicircles were related
to reaction processes in the anode and cathode, whereas the low-frequency
lines indicated mass transport diffusion processes.28,29 In this study, we employed the equivalent circuit displayed in Figure 4e to run the impedance
spectrum fitting. In the equivalent circuit, R1 is the overall ohmic
resistance from the molten sodium anode, BASE, NaAlCl4,
and cathode. R2 and CPE1 are charge-transfer resistance and double-layer
capacitance from the electrodes, respectively. We employed a Warburg
impedance, Wo1, to fit the diffusion process at the low frequencies.
The fitting results are shown in Figure 4a–d. It can be seen that the curves
fit the impedance spectra very well at different SOCs, indicating
that the proposed equivalent circuit worked for the current Na–ZnCl2 system. The R1 and R2 calculated from the fitting model are
listed in Table 1.
The value of R1 gradually increased with the increase of SOC. This
was reasonable because Zn particles serve as the electron pathway
in the cathode and they were continuously consumed during charging,
which led to the increase in the cathode and overall cell ohmic resistance.
Although the value of R2 slightly increased from 0 to 50% SOC, it
doubled from 50 to 100% SOC. R2 is the charge-transfer resistance,
which was mainly from the cathode. The much lower R2 values during
testing at 0 and 50% SOC (step 1) were in agreement with their higher
capacity and rate capability, as shown in Figure 3.

To further understand the mechanism for the higher
capacity and
rate capability, the microstructures of the NaCl–Zn cathodes
at different SOCs were analyzed using SEM/energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectroscopy. The cross-sectional images and EDX maps of the
cathodes are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a
shows the SEM image of the cathode at 0% SOC. According to the XRD
results, the cathode consisted of NaCl and Zn along with NaAlCl4. The bright particles with irregular shapes were Zn metal,
which was confirmed by EDX elemental mapping (Figure 5b). It should be noted that, because the
position of the Lα emission line from elemental Zn is very close
to that of the Kα emission line from elemental Na (1.012 vs
1.041 keV), the signals from Zn metal were observed in the Na elemental
mapping (see Figure 5c). However, as shown in the figure, the signals from Zn were stronger
than those from Na, so we still could differentiate Zn metal from
NaCl. The slightly bright red particles were Zn metal, whereas the
dark ones were NaCl with an average size of ∼10 μm. The
existence of NaCl particles was also confirmed from Cl mapping, as
shown in Figure 5d
(bright yellow spots). After the combined analysis of Figure 5b–d, we confirmed that
the other areas with a medium yellow color in Figure 5d were NaAlCl4. On the basis of
the discussion above, we can conclude that, at the beginning of charging
(0% SOC), the cathode consisted of Zn metal and NaCl. The NaCl particles
were round with an average size of ∼10 μm. Figure 5e shows the SEM image of the
cathode at 50% SOC. The morphology of the cathode was different from
that at 0% SOC (see Figure 5a). Ribbons with a width of 5–10 μm were observed
in the microstructure. After carefully analyzing the elemental maps
in Figure 5f–h,
we believed that the ribbons were Na2ZnCl4,
and the irregularly shaped particles with a brighter color in Figure 5e,g were Zn metal;
the round NaCl particles disappeared. These were consistent with the
XRD results, indicating that all of the active NaCl was converted
to Na2ZnCl4, and the active materials in the
cathode were Na2ZnCl4 and Zn metal at 50% SOC. Figure 5i–l shows
the cross-sectional images and EDX maps of the cathode at 100% SOC.
The cathode morphology was completely different from those at 0 and
50% SOCs. The ribbon-type Na2ZnCl4 disappeared,
and ZnCl2 formed at the edge of the Zn particles. At the
end of charging, ZnCl2 was the final product along with
excess Zn particles as the electron percolation pathway.

On the basis of all the results
and discussion above, we have proposed
a reaction mechanism for the Na–ZnCl2 chemistry
at 190 °C. The mechanism is similar to that of the well-known
mechanism for the Na–NiCl2 system proposed in our
previous study.13 Two mechanisms are compared
in Figure 6. For the
Na–NiCl2 system, the active materials in the cathode
are NaCl and Ni before charging (refer to Figure 5a). The particle size of NaCl is significantly
larger than that of Ni on the basis of our previous observation. At
the beginning of charging, NaCl reacts with Ni to form NiCl2 in the contact area of the two particles, as shown in Figure 6a. The formation of a NiCl2 layer at the interface isolates Ni from NaCl, which limits
further reaction between the two particles. Then, during the continued
charging, Ni particles react with NaCl in the NaAlCl4 melt,
which forms NiCl2 layers on the surface of Ni. To maintain
neutrality of the melt, the NaCl particles continuously dissolve into
the melt. At the end of charging, all of the active NaCl is consumed,
and a thick layer of NiCl2 covers most of the surface of
the Ni particles. Because NiCl2 is nonconductive, this
coating significantly limits the rate capability for the Na–NiCl2 cell, as shown in Figure 3a,e. A two-step reaction mechanism is proposed for
the Na–ZnCl2 system, which is unlike the Na–NiCl2 counterpart. During step 1, NaCl reacts with Zn to form a
thin layer of Na2ZnCl4 in the contact area of
the two particles (refer to Figure 6b), which is similar to the Na–NiCl2 counterpart. The major difference is that, unlike NiCl2, the formed Na2ZnCl4 layer likely serves as
a bridge and can continuously supply either NaCl or Zn2+ to the reaction sites, which finally consumes all of the active
NaCl and forms a ribbon-type Na2ZnCl4 layer
at the end of the step (i.e., middle of charging), which was confirmed
by the SEM images (refer to Figure 5e). Because the Na2ZnCl4 layer
is only formed at the interface of the particles rather than covering
most of the surface area of the Ni particles, the rate capability
for this step is not affected, as shown in Figure 3a,e. During step 2, the formed Na2ZnCl4 is gradually consumed to form a thin layer of ZnCl2 at the interface. Similar to that with NiCl2,
the formation of the ZnCl2 layer isolates Zn from Na2ZnCl4, which prohibits further reaction between
the two particles. The continued charging is through the NaAlCl4 melt, which forms ZnCl2 layers on the surface
of Zn. The nature of ZnCl2 is similar to that of NiCl2, so the formed ZnCl2 covers most of the surface
area of the Zn particles and leads to a limitation in the rate capability
as well.

Conclusions
The cathode reaction mechanism for the Na–ZnCl2 battery has been investigated at 190 °C. Two-step reversible
reactions have been identified. During charging, a first-step reaction
between NaCl and Zn particles generated Na2ZnCl4 at the interface. The produced Na2ZnCl4 served
as a bridge and continuously supplied either NaCl or Zn2+ to the reaction sites, which finally formed a ribbon-type Na2ZnCl4 layer at the interface of the particles.
Because the Na2ZnCl4 layer was formed at the
interface rather than covering the surface of the Ni particles, the
rate capability for this step was excellent. During step 2, the formed
Na2ZnCl4 was gradually consumed to form ZnCl2 at the interface between Na2ZnCl4 and
Zn. The formation of the ZnCl2 layer isolated Zn from Na2ZnCl4, which prohibited further reaction between
the two phases. The continued charging was through the NaAlCl4 melt, which formed ZnCl2 layers on the surface
of Zn particles. Because of the nonconductive nature of ZnCl2, the formed ZnCl2 covered most of the surface area of
Zn particles, which led to a limitation in the rate capability.

Experimental
Fabrication
of BASE Discs
BASE discs were fabricated
using a vapor phase process, as described previously.15,30 Starting powders were high-purity α-Al2O3 (Almatis, >99.8%) and yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ, UCM Advanced
Ceramics, 8 wt %). A mixture of 70 vol % α-Al2O3 and 30 vol % YSZ was ball-milled with a dispersant (Phospholan
PS-236, AkzoNobel), solvents (methyl ethyl ketone/ethanol), a plasticizer
(benzyl butyl phthalate, Aldrich), and a binder (Butvar B-79) to make
a slurry. After the slurry was cast into a thin sheet (∼125
μm), the sheets were laminated and laser-cut to form discs.
The discs were sintered at 1600 °C in air to achieve full density
(>99%). The sintered α-Al2O3/YSZ discs
were then placed in loose β″-Al2O3 powder with 10% NaAlO2 and heat-treated at 1450 °C
in air to convert α-Al2O3 into β″-Al2O3. The β″-Al2O3 powder used in the conversion process was synthesized using boehmite,
Na2CO3, and Li2CO3 via
a solid-state reaction.31 The conversion
occurred by a coupled transport of sodium and oxygen ions from the
β″-Al2O3 powder to the samples.
The thickness of the converted composite β″-Al2O3/YSZ discs was ∼500 μm.

Cell Construction
and Testing
During cell testing,
the cell cathode consisted of granules of Zn or Ni, NaCl, and small
amounts of additives. The molar ratio between metal (i.e., Zn or Ni)
and NaCl in the cathode was 1.8:1. An amount of Zn metal (∼28%)
was consumed during the electrochemical reactions, and the rest of
the Zn metal (∼72%) was for electron percolation. The Ni particles
were round with a particle size of 2–10 μm, and the Zn
particles were irregular with a size from 5 to 30 μm. After
a final drying treatment to eliminate all traces of moisture under
vacuum at 200 °C, molten NaAlCl4 secondary electrolyte
was infiltrated into the granules. A foil and a spring made of Mo
were placed on top of the cathode as the current collector. On the
anode side, a spring-loaded metal shim was inserted into the anode
compartment to serve as a sodium reservoir. The anode and cathode
end plates were then compressed onto the α-Al2O3 ring with metal O-rings. Nickel leads were welded to the
electrode end plates as current collectors. The active cell area was
∼3 cm2.

The assembled cells were heated in
air to 190 °C for testing. For Na–ZnCl2 cells,
they were initially charged up to 2.3 V with a constant current of
10 mA (i.e., 3.33 mA/cm2). The cells were then discharged
back to 1.7 V under the same current. After the initial cycle, the
cells were cycled between the cutoff voltages of 1.7 and 2.3 V. For
those cells cycled at higher current densities (>20 mA/cm2), the cutoff voltages were 1.7 and 2.4 V to ensure reasonable cell
performance. The Na–NiCl2 cells were cycled between
1.8 and 2.8 V. The cycling was under constant currents from 6.67 to
33.33 mA/cm2 for both charging and discharging.

Post-analysis
of the Cathode
After cell testing, a
few of the cells were stopped at different states of charge (SOCs),
and the impedance spectra were collected with an electrochemical interface
(Solartron 1287, Solartron Analytical) and a frequency response analyzer
(Solartron 1260, Solartron Analytical) under open-circuit voltage.
The frequency range was from 2 MHz to 0.01 Hz, and the ac amplitude
was 10 mV. The cells were then cooled down to room temperature and
transferred to a glovebox for disassembly. The cross sections of the
cathodes were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Model
JSM-5900LV, JEOL Company, Japan) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX) spectroscopy . A few pieces of the cathodes were crushed and
ground in an agate mortar to obtain finely grained powders for X-ray
diffraction (XRD) analysis. Because of the hygroscopic nature of NaAlCl4 in the cathodes, the samples were prepared in the glovebox.
The powder sample was loaded onto an XRD glass sample holder, and
the holder was subsequently sealed with Kapton tape. The sealed sample
was then put on to the XRD sample stage for XRD analysis. The measurement
was carried out at room temperature in the 2θ range of 10–80°
with Cu Kα radiation.
