The protein cereblon
serves as a substrate receptor of a ubiquitin
ligase complex that can be tuned toward different target proteins
by cereblon-binding agents. This approach to targeted protein degradation
is exploited in different clinical settings and has sparked the development
of a growing number of thalidomide derivatives. Here, we probe the
chemical space of cereblon binding beyond such derivatives and work
out a simple set of chemical requirements, delineating the metaclass
of cereblon effectors. We report co-crystal structures for a diverse
set of compounds, including commonly used pharmaceuticals, but also
find that already minimalistic cereblon-binding moieties might exert
teratogenic effects in zebrafish. Our results may guide the design
of a post-thalidomide generation of therapeutic cereblon effectors
and provide a framework for the circumvention of unintended cereblon
binding by negative design for future pharmaceuticals.

Introduction
Thalidomide had a changeful
career. Marketed as a sedative and
hypnotic, it was considered a safe agent to alleviate morning sickness
of pregnant women, until it had to be understood that a sudden wave
of severe birth defects had to be ascribed to its administration.
However, because of its immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic
properties, thalidomide continued raising attention as a promising
agent in the treatment of a growing range of clinical conditions over
the years after its withdrawal,1−4 sparking the development of derivatives as anti-cancer
agents, commonly referred to as immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). Especially
lenalidomide, the most prominent IMiD, has been highly successful
in the treatment of multiple myeloma and other B cell malignancies but also in myelodysplastic syndrome.5

Thalidomide and related IMiDs mediate their effects
by binding
to the protein cereblon, a substrate receptor of the CRL4A E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex.6 The IMiD-binding site
is situated in the C-terminal domain, the thalidomide-binding domain
of human cereblon, which is also termed CULT domain.7 Other domains of cereblon or components of the E3 ligase
complex are not involved in IMiD binding. The architecture of the
binding pocket is highly conserved across species, from bacterial
to mammalian cereblon proteins.8−10 It contains three strictly conserved
tryptophan residues that form a rectangular cage upon ligand binding—in
unliganded state, the thalidomide-binding domain was reported to be
unfolded to large extents.11 Thalidomide
and its derivatives have their cereblon-binding moiety, a glutarimide
ring, slotted into this cage, while the remainder of the molecule
protrudes from the binding pocket. This protruding moiety contributes
to the molecular interface formed by the surface around the folded
binding pocket and thereby modulates the substrate spectrum of the
cereblon-CRL4A E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. The binding of effector
molecules and also mutation of the binding pocket can thereby preclude
the recognition and processing of endogenous substrates, as shown
for the homeobox transcription factor MEIS2,9 ion channels,12 and the amyloid precursor
protein.13

Contrariwise, the molecular
interface formed upon IMiD binding
mediates the recognition and ubiquitination of neosubstrates, such
as the B cell-specific zinc-finger transcription factors IKZF1 and
IKZF3,14−16 casein kinase 1A1 (CK1α),17 and the translation termination factor GSPT1,18 which are targeted via different IMiDs. The
identification of these neo-substrates provided a rationale for the
efficacy of IMiDs in multiple myeloma (IKFZ1 and IKFZ3), 5q-deletion
associated myelodysplastic syndrome (CK1α), and acute myeloid
leukemia (GSPT1). Notably, these different neo-substrates are recognized
and bound via a common structural degron, a zinc finger motif for
IKFZ1 and IKFZ3 or a zinc finger-like loop for CK1α and GSPT1.
This degron is selectively recognized by the molecular interface formed
around the IMiD-binding pocket, with a specificity that is fine-tuned
by the protruding moiety of the bound IMiD.18,19 Furthermore, beyond classical IMiDs, targeted degradation via cereblon
is currently investigated in a so-called PROTAC (proteolysis targeting
chimera) approach. PROTACs are designed small molecules with a binding
moiety for a specific target protein linked to a moiety that is recognized
by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, providing a simple means of proximity-induced
ubiquitination. Using thalidomide as a cereblon recruiting moiety,
a number of PROTACs for cereblon-targeting have been developed to
recruit the cancer targets BCR-ABL,20 BRD4,21 BRD9,22 SIRT2,23 and ERK1/224 for degradation.

For a better understanding
of cereblon-mediated substrate recognition
and potential teratogenicity, we here aim to characterize the chemical
and structural requirements for cereblon effector molecules. Inspired
by structural similarity to glutarimide, we have previously verified
that the uracil moiety of uridine is bound in the same way and causes
the same teratogenic effects in zebrafish as thalidomide.10 These results implied also other compounds with
structurally related groups as potential cereblon effectors. In fact,
several pharmaceuticals were classified as teratogens merely because
of their structural similarity to thalidomide. We have previously
established cereblon isoform 4 from Magnetospirillum
gryphiswaldense (MsCI4), a bacterial single-domain
homolog to the thalidomide-binding domain of human cereblon, as a
model system,10,11 and developed an in-vitro Förster
resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay for the identification and
characterization of cereblon effectors.25 We now use this assay to delineate the chemical space of cereblon
binding in a rational approach driven by structural similarity to
thalidomide. Representative binders are tested in vivo in zebrafish,
and the binding mode of most classes of compounds is elucidated by
crystallography at high resolution. Our results delineate a simple
pharmacophore for thalidomide-like cereblon binding. The resulting
list of potential and verified binders comprises a wide spectrum of
different classes of small molecules and commonly used pharmaceuticals,
constituting the metaclass of cereblon effectors.

Results
Generalized
Pharmacophore-Based Nomenclature
In the
initial characterization of the thalidomide-binding domain, we found
that substitutions at the glutarimide or uracil ring are compatible
with cereblon binding only in certain positions.10 As the IUPAC numbering of the positions differs between
the different binding moieties, we use a simplified nomenclature based
on the position occupied within the binding pocket (Figure 1). This nomenclature outlines
a simple pharmacophore with up to 6 positions a–f, depending on ring size. Position a is that of the
branched nitrogen in uridine and respectively the branched glutarimide
carbon in thalidomide, which faces to the outside of the binding pocket.
Positions b, c, and d correspond
to the outward-facing carbonyl, the NH group, and the inward-facing
carbonyl group, respectively.

bonds formed within the pocket. (c) Pharmacophore-based nomenclature
describing the ring-positions a–f within the pocket.

Minimal Requirements for
Basal Binding Moieties
The
two known binding groups glutarimide and uracil are both cyclic imides,
with the functional group R–CO–NH–CO–R′
occupying positions b, c, and d. It seemed therefore likely that also other such imides would bind
to cereblon. Remarkably, a common mode of teratogenicity of imides
had been suggested by Gary Shull in 1984, long before the connection
to cereblon was established, albeit in another biological context.26 In co-crystal structures, the glutarimide and
uracil moieties form the same two crucial hydrogen bonds within the
binding pocket; one between the NH group in position c and a backbone carbonyl, and another one between the carbonyl in
position d and a backbone NH group. As judged from the
available structures10 and sequence conservation,7,10 these are the only conserved hydrogen bonds that are formed in cereblon·thalidomide
complexes across all species. This suggests that only one of the imide
carbonyl groups is required and therefore implies lactams, cyclic
rings with the functional group R–NH–CO–R′,
as minimal binders. Consequently, we composed our starting set of
test compounds of both imides and lactams of reasonable ring size
but also included their basal cyclic secondary amines without carbonyl
groups.

To test for the binding of the different compounds,
we had previously developed a FRET-based assay. It relies on the out-competition
of a reporter ligand, which forms a FRET pair with the tryptophans
of the MsCI4 binding pocket, by a test ligand. In this assay, different
cereblon proteins show the same differential affinities to test compounds
on a relative scale,25 such that Ki values obtained for MsCI4 can be translated
for the human protein semi-quantitatively. For the comparison of Ki values between different studies, it is important
to note that the affinities of isolated thalidomide-binding domains
are generally reduced about 100-fold as compared to full-length human
cereblon.27 Using the FRET assay, we now
found that at least one carbonyl group is necessary for binding (Figure 2), whereas the affinity
is increased by a second carbonyl group for both 5- and 6-membered
rings. Generally, the affinity for 5-membered rings was higher than
that of their 6-membered counterparts. Further, while 4-membered basal
β-lactam was bound with an affinity comparable to its 5-membered
counterpart, 7-membered basal ε-lactam (caprolactam, Table S1) showed no detectable binding, indicating
that 7-membered rings are beyond the size-limit. In further tests,
we could verify the necessity of the NH group of the lactams and imides
for binding: neither 4-, 5-, or 6-membered cyclic anhydrides, lactones
nor ketones, with the respective functional groups R–CO–O–CO–R′,
R–O–CO–R′, or R–CO–R′,
showed any detectable binding (Table S1).

Figure 2 Minimal binding requirements for basic binding moieties. (a) At
least one carbonyl group is necessary for binding. For both 5- and
6-membered rings, imides showed higher affinities than lactams, whereas
basic heterocyclic amines did not bind. Maleimide bound with reduced
affinity as compared to its saturated counterpart succinimide. (b)
Compounds with heteroatoms in position a showed reduced
affinity. Notably, the unsaturated uracil bound with a higher affinity
than the saturated dihydrouracil, showing the opposite trend as the
succinimide–maleimide pair. Experimental Ki values for MsCI4 are listed in shaded boxes, with the
intensity of red increasing with affinity.

We subsequently tested the effect of an additional heteroatom
within
the rings and found that they systematically lower the affinity for
both 5- and 6-membered rings, with sulfur having a larger impact than
a second NH group in position a. Conversely, comparing
the affinities of saturated and unsaturated rings did not reveal a
clear trend for the compounds tested (Figure 2).

Effect of Substitutions
To sample
the effect of possible
substituents, we assayed a variety of commercially available substances
based on the identified basal binding moieties with different modifications.
We first probed the effect of substitutions that do not impair the
imide moiety, leaving positions b, c, and d unaltered. Therefore, for 6-membered rings, we probed the
effect of substituents and modifications in positions a, e, and f (Figure 3). In comparison to glutarimide, we tested
the compounds thalidomide and aminoglutethimide, both branched in
position a, as well as cycloheximide, branched in position f. Notably, while the affinity of thalidomide, which carries
a single substituent at position a, is significantly
improved over the basal glutarimide, the affinity for aminoglutethimide,
which is double branched in position a, is slightly lowered.
On the contrary, the large position-f substituent in
cycloheximide abolished binding, as could be expected from the tight
steric constraints within the binding pocket.

Figure 3 Substitutions in positions a, e, and f in 6-membered rings
derived from glutarimide (left) and
uracil (right). Compounds with single substitutions in position a showed increased affinity, whereas aminoglutethimide, double
branched in a, showed reduced affinity; substitutions
in f abrogated binding. Binding of pseudouridine was
not detectable, implying that a polar group in position e abolishes binding. Although any substitutions in position e are expected to abolish binding for steric reasons, the
affinities for thymine and thymidine, both single branched in position e, were not negligible.

In comparison to uracil, we assayed the compounds barbiturate,
uridine, deoxyuridine, pseudouridine, thymine, and thymidine. In barbiturate,
the carbonyl group in position f abolished binding as
observed for the larger substituent in cycloheximide. Uridine and
deoxyuridine, both N-glycosides of uracil, showed enhanced affinity
as compared to uracil, whereas pseudouridine, a C-glycoside of uracil,
showed no detectable binding. Pseudouridine has the sugar attached
to the uracil C,5 which potentially renders
the uracil N1 in position e for steric reasons
(Figure 3). This implies
that an NH group in position e, representing a buried
unsatisfied polar group, abolishes binding. Surprisingly, we observed
very low but measurable affinities for thymine and thymidine. On the
basis of our previous experiments, in which thymidine did not cause
the same chemical shift changes as uridine in NMR measurements and
did not show teratogenic effects in vivo,10 these were expected to be undetectable. Consequently, the interactions
of thymine and thymidine with the thalidomide-binding pocket observed
in the FRET assay are seemingly not equivalent to those of uridine
or thalidomide, possibly leading to an incomplete folding of the pocket.

For 5-membered rings, we assayed compounds based on succinimide
(pyrrolidine-2,5-dione), hydantoin (imidazolidine-2,4-dione), oxazolidine-2,4-dione,
and γ-butyrolactam (Figure 4). For the succinimide derivative ethosuximide, double-branched
at position a, the affinity was lower as for succinimide.
Interestingly, for the corresponding hydantoin derivative 5-ethyl-5-methylhydantoin,
no binding was detectable. This can, as for pseudouridine, most probably
be accredited to the additional NH group that would render a buried
unsatisfied polar group in position e, as the double-branched
position would need to occupy position a for steric reasons.
Consistently, the analogous oxazolidinedione derivative 5,5-dimethyloxazolidine-2,4-dione
showed no detectable binding, presumably as the strongly electronegative
oxygen is not compatible with position e. In contrast, N-methylhydantoin, which is single-branched at the additional
heteroatom of the hydantoin ring, binds even tighter than its parent
compound. Last, as a derivative of γ-butyrolactam, we aimed
to test rolipram. Because of solubility issues (see Materials and Methods), we were not able to assess a binding
constant, but could verify its binding via crystallography (see below).

Figure 4 Substitutions
in positions a and e in
5-membered rings. Derivatives of succinimide, hydantoin, oxazolidinedione,
and γ-lactam were assayed. In agreement with 6-membered rings,
single substitutions in a lead to increased, while double
substitutions in a lead to reduced affinity. Also, polar
groups or branching in position e are detrimental. Oxazolidinedione
was not available; binding of rolipram could only be verified by crystallography.

Finally, we assayed the effect
of substitutions in positions b and d, the
positions of the nonobligatory and
the mandatory carbonyl group, respectively (Figure 5). In both positions, imino groups were detrimental
for binding, possibly because of their major tautomers, in which the
hydrogen would be abstracted from the ring’s NH group, thereby
preventing one of the two hydrogen bonds with the protein backbone.
In contrast, thiol groups behaved differently in the two positions.
While a thiol in position d was detrimental, it led to
a threefold increase in affinity in position b. In the
same position, an exchange to a methyl group led to slightly reduced
affinity.

Figure 5 Substitutions in positions b and d. In
both b and d, imino groups are detrimental
for binding. In d, also a thiocarbonyl group is detrimental.
In b, a thiocarbonyl group leads to increased, while
a methyl group leads to reduced affinity. For cytosine and 2-imino-N-methylhydantoin, the major tautomers are shown on the
bottom.

Noncyclic Compounds
Inspired by Shull’s paper,26 we
also assayed the linear imide acetylurea.
It indeed bound to MsCI4, albeit with a poor Ki of 522 μM (Figure S1). We
assume that it binds in a conformation mimicking cyclic imides, with
the primary amine in position a, the imide group occupying
positions b, c, and d, and
the methyl group in position e. This assumption is supported
by the fact that the derivative phenylacetylurea, which is substituted
at the acetylurea methyl group, did not bind in our assay. We therefore
speculated that the acetamide group (CH3CONH2) could be the minimal binding moiety, so that acetylated primary
amines could be generally bound in this mode. This could suggest posttranslational
acetylation as a possible protein modification recognized by cereblon.
However, we could not detect any binding for basal acetamide, N-(2-aminoethyl)acetamide, N-(3-hydroxypropyl)acetamide,
or 2-azaniumyl-6-acetamidohexanoate (N-ε-acetyllysine)
(Figure S1).

Crystal Structures Confirm
a Common Binding Mode for Representative
Compounds
In a next step, we characterized the binding of
representative compounds via X-ray crystallography. To this end, we
grew crystals of the MsCI4·thalidomide complex10 and exchanged the bound thalidomide for other ligands via
soaking, for lactams and imides with 5- and 6-membered rings and with
different substitutions in positions a and b. This approach was indeed highly selective for cereblon effectors—attempts
to exchange thalidomide for nonbinders resulted in unfolding of the
thalidomide-binding pocket as reported for related “washing”-experiments.11 The soaking experiments resulted in MsCI4·ligand
crystal structures capturing the binding mode of aminoglutethimide,
ethosuximide, rolipram, γ-butyrolactam, δ-valerolactam,
glutarimide, hydantoin, 2-thiohydantoin, and thiazolidine-2,4-dione
at resolutions between 1.55 and 2.3 Å (Figure 6). Together with the previously reported
MsCI4·deoxyuridine structure, the available structures now exhibit
the accommodation of eight different binding moieties: glutarimide,
uracil, succinimide, hydantoin, 2-thiohydantoin, thiazolidine-2,4-dione,
γ-butyrolactam, and δ-valerolactam. The structures verify
a number of assumptions we made on the basis of the binding studies:
(I) The comparison of the binding modes of thalidomide, aminoglutethimide,
and glutarimide shows that the substituents in position a do not influence the basic binding mode of the basal binding moiety.
(II) The structures with ethosuximide, hydantoin, 2-thiohydantoin,
and thiazolidine-2,4-dione verify that imides with 5-membered rings
have the same basic binding mode as 6-membered rings. (III) The binding
mode of γ-butyrolactam, δ-valerolactam and rolipram verifies
that lactams have a binding mode analogous to imides, with their carbonyl
group occupying position d. (IV) The binding modes of
hydantoin, 2-thiohydantoin, and thiazolidine-2,4-dione show that 5-membered
rings with further heteroatoms are oriented such that the heteroatom,
nitrogen or sulfur, occupies position a. (V) The structure
with 2-thiohydantoin shows that a thiol group in position b is spatially accommodated like a carbonyl group. The latter observation
further suggests that methyl substituents as in 5-methyl-pyrrolidin-2-one
can be accommodated in position b in the same way. Importantly,
in a direct comparison with the crystal structure of the human thalidomide-binding
domain, none of the protruding moieties of the effectors is interacting
or in contact with any nonconserved amino acid side chain, such that
their binding modes are not influenced by species-specific differences
(Figure S2).

Figure 6 Crystallographic characterization
of effector molecules. The binding
of representative compounds was studied at 1.2–2.3 Å resolution.
For all, the binding mode was the same as for thalidomide in Figure 1. Individual compounds
are shown with an FO–FC omit map contoured
at the indicated contrast levels. For 2-thiohydantoin and thiazolidine-2,4-dione,
a second omit map at higher contrast level in black clearly identifies
the sulfur. Superpositions of the compounds within the binding pocket
are shown on the right, from different orientations. The top row shows
the unbranched compounds and the bottom row shows the a-substituted compounds identified in this study, together with the
previously reported thalidomide and deoxyuridine.10 The PDB accession codes of the new co-structures are 5OH1, 5OH2, 5OH3, 5OH4, 5OH7, 5OH8, 5OH9, 5OHA, and 5OHB.

Minimal Core Compounds are Active in Vivo
To verify
that the identified binders, especially the basal compounds without
protruding moieties, also bind eukaryotic cereblon in vivo, we assayed
the effects of representative compounds in a zebrafish assay. The
assay was initially used to show that the teratogenic effect of thalidomide
was mediated via cereblon and can thus also be used to assess the
teratogenic potential of substances. The treatment of zebrafish embryos
with thalidomide resulted in the development of stunted pectoral fins,
an effect that could be rescued by the injection of mRNA encoding
a thalidomide-insensitive cereblon mutant.6 We previously adopted this assay to show that uridine had the same
effect on fin formation10 and now used
it to test the effect of minimal core compounds, that is, effectors
with no or only small protruding moieties. We therefore tested glutarimide,
hydantoin, succinimide, and ethosuximide in comparison to the nonbinder
barbiturate (Figure 7). As observed for thalidomide and uridine, a higher proportion of
stunted fins was observed in presence of each effector, and in all
cases, the effect was alleviated when thalidomide-insensitive cereblon
mutant mRNA was injected. As in previous experiments, injection of
wild-type cereblon mRNA was less alleviating.10 Notably, the results do not show a clear correlation between the
affinity of the compounds and the severity of the teratogenic effect.
The strongest effect was achieved with glutarimide, which has an affinity
ranking in the midfield of the tested compounds. Furthermore, while
the results of glutarimide, succinimide, and ethosuximide are well
comparable to those of thalidomide and uridine,10 the effect of hydantoin seems attenuated, hinting at an
influence of differences in bioavailability and metabolic stability
of the compounds. A difference in the magnitude of the rescue effects
of the thalidomide-insensitive cereblon mutant mRNA for the different
compounds may also point at further toxicological effects in addition
to cereblon binding for some compounds. However, no effect was seen
in the closely related nonbinder barbiturate. These results indicate
that the compounds identified to bind MsCI4 in vitro indeed also bind
eukaryotic cereblon in vivo. They further indicate that already minimal
binders without protruding moieties exert effects similar to thalidomide
in zebrafish, implying that ligand-induced folding of the binding
pocket is already sufficient to modulate cereblon substrate specificity.

cereblon effectors. The images illustrate the diagnostic criteria
of pectoral fin malformations at 75 h post fertilization. The effectors
glutarimide, hydantoin, succinimide, and ethosuximide cause developmental
defects as evoked by thalidomide. These effects can be alleviated
by injecting zcrbnYW/AA mRNA, encoding a thalidomide-insensitive
cereblon mutant. In comparison, barbiturate does not cause any effects.
The total number of fish in each experiment is given below the bars,
while the bars indicate the percentages of these fish fulfilling the
criteria for no, mild, medium, or severe effects.

Discussion
Metaclass of Cereblon Effectors
Our results allow for
the formulation of a simple pharmacophore that describes a metaclass
of cereblon effectors. Noteworthy binding was only found for cyclic
binding moieties, with lactams being the most basic form. Overall,
5-membered rings have a higher affinity than 4- or 6-membered rings,
whereas 7-membered rings are too large to bind. This results in a
simple pharmacophore model that describes up to 6 positions of a ring,
positions a–f (Figure 1). For binding, an unmodified lactam group
occupying positions c and d is mandatory.
In position e and—for 6-membered rings—position f, heteroatoms or branching substitutions abolish binding.
Consequently, only positions a and b are
open for modifications, and the affinity of compounds can be modulated
by such modifications. In position a, the incorporation
of a heteroatom reduces affinity. This could not be tested for position b, as there were no suitable test compounds available. In
both positions, single substituents increase the affinity, while compounds
double-branched in position a show reduced affinity.
The metaclass comprises compounds from different classes of common
small molecules, covering several pharmaceuticals (Figure 8 and Table S1).

Figure 8 Comparison of different pharmaceuticals verified or predicted as
cereblon effectors. For glutarimides, the predicted binders glutethimide
and its derivatives aminoglutethimide, rogletimide, and dexetimide
are compared. Exemplarily, the affinity was determined for the freely
available aminoglutethimide. Because of their almost identical structure,
differing only in the most distal end of their protruding moiety,
glutethimide and rogletimide are expected to bind with a virtually
identical affinity. We further tried to assay the structurally slightly
more complex dexetimide but could not overcome solubility issues.
From the uracils dasabuvir and sofosbuvir only the latter could be
assessed in the FRET assay, revealing an affinity comparable to uridine.
Dasabuvir was not tractable due to solubility issues. For the same
reason, the two hydantoins nitrofurantoin and dantrolene could not
be assessed. As a succinimide-based drug, the affinity of ethosuximide
was determined. From the γ-lactams rolipram and lidanserin,
only the latter could be assessed in the FRET assay, revealing an
affinity comparable to uridine. Rolipram was not tractable in the
FRET assay but binding was confirmed via crystallography.

For 6-membered rings, the δ-lactam piperidin-2-one
poses
the minimal binding moiety. In pharmaceuticals, piperidin-2-ones substituted
in positions a and b are most widely represented
in the form of glutarimides. For basic glutarimide, we verified binding
in vitro and in vivo. Prominent glutarimides substituted in position a are the known cereblon effectors thalidomide, pomalidomide,
and lenalidomide but also the hypnotic sedative glutethimide and its
derivatives. As a representative, we verified the binding of the derivative
aminoglutethimide, an antisteroid drug used in the treatment of Cushing’s
syndrome28 and of breast and prostate cancer.
For having modifications only in the protruding moiety outside the
binding pocket, also the other derivatives depicted in Figure 8, the anticholinergic drug
dexetimide and the aromatase inhibitor and anticancer agent rogletimide
are likely binders. We note that the identification of anticancer
agents as binders does not necessarily imply a functional connection.
For pyrimidine-based uracils, which have a second amine embedded within
the ring, we showed the binding of basal uracil and its saturated
analog dihydrouracil. The additional amino group has to occupy position a, which is therefore the only position that may be branched
in cereblon-binding uracils. This is well illustrated by the discrimination
between the N-glycoside uridine and the C-glycoside pseudouridine.
The verification of uridine and deoxyuridine as binders in the FRET
assay also substantiates the in-vivo effect we reported for uridine.10 Uracil solely—or bound to a ribose analogue—is
often found as a building block of antiviral drugs. This implies pharmaceuticals
such as dasabuvir and sofosbuvir, both approved for the treatment
of hepatitis C infections, as potential binders. While dasabuvir was
intractable in our assay, we could determine the affinity of sofosbuvir,
which is comparable to that of uridine (Figure 8).

Analogously, for 5-membered rings,
the γ-lactam pyrrolidin-2-one
poses the basic binding moiety, which is found in several pharmaceuticals.
A prominent example is the selective phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor
and potential antidepressant drug rolipram,29 containing a γ-lactam moiety substituted in position a, for which we verified binding. Lidanserin, which acts as
a 5-HT2A and α1-adrenergic receptor antagonist and was developed
as an antihypertensive agent,30 is based
on the same scaffold. Expectedly, we could verify its binding with
an affinity in the range of most other effectors single-branched in a (Figure 8). The minimal imide binding moiety built from a 5-membered ring
is succinimide, for which we verified binding in-vitro and in-vivo.
As a succinimide derivative substituted in a, we demonstrated
both in-vitro and in-vivo binding for ethosuximide, a prominent anticonvulsant
considered as the first choice drug for treating absence seizures.31 Also the unsaturated succinimide counterpart
maleimide, a common building block in organic synthesis, could be
verified as a binder, albeit with lower affinity. For counterparts
with an additional heteroatom, we could show binding of thiazolidine-2,4-dione
and hydantoin. Here, as for the uracils, the heteroatom has to occupy
position a, which allows only substitutions in this position.
Consequently, we could confirm the binding of N-methylhydantoin.
It is highly likely that the N-substituted hydantoin nitrofurantoin,
an antibiotic commonly used in the treatment of urinary tract infections,
and the muscle relaxant dantrolene are also cereblon binders, albeit
both were intractable in the FRET assay (Figure 8). For the thiohydantoins, in which the carbonyl
group in position b is replaced by a thiocarbonyl group,
the same considerations apply as for basal hydantoins, with increased
overall affinity in the assay. We expect the same binding mode for
the structurally similar oxazolidinediones, representing the core
structure of a variety of anticonvulsant drugs, but suitable compounds
for testing were not available to us.

Finally, the minimal 4-membered
ring, the β-lactam azetidin-2-one
is the smallest compound for which we verified binding in the assay.
Owing to its rectangular geometry, substitutions in a could potentially abolish binding, which remains to be tested. However,
position b is expected to be open for modifications as
in the larger γ- and δ-lactams.

On Cereblon and Teratogenicity
Given that the thalidomide-binding
domain is found in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, as single-domain
protein and embedded within multi-domain proteins, localized within
the cell and potentially secreted to the extracellular milieu,7 it seems highly likely that it serves a universal
function. The strict conservation of the thalidomide-binding site
across species in both sequence and structure strongly suggests that
it recognizes a ligand or structural motif that is universal in all
domains of life. So far, apart from uridine, the only identified natural
interactors of the thalidomide-binding domain are endogenous substrate
proteins. Their binding mode is structurally not yet characterized,
but thought to be mutually exclusive to the binding of the known effectors.

Our work strengthens the idea that cereblon effectors are potential
teratogens. However, experimental work on teratogenicity is complicated
by the fact that not all species are susceptible to thalidomide teratogenicity
to the same extent. While zebrafish and chicks appear to be affected
in a similar way as humans,6 rodents were
reported to be mostly insensitive to thalidomide.32 For this reason, teratogenicity studies in animals cannot
be directly translated to humans. Consequently, it is unclear if all
cereblon effectors could have teratogenic effects in human, although
they appear to generally induce teratogenicity in zebrafish.

It is a long-standing question if teratogenicity is caused by an
endogenous substrate that is precluded from ubiquitination or by a
neo-substrate that is recruited for ubiquitination. As the known endogenous
substrate proteins do not possess chemical moieties covered by the
metaclass of cereblon effectors, their binding mode is conceivably
different and might induce another yet unobserved conformation of
the thalidomide-binding domain than that induced by the effectors.
For zebrafish, it has been shown that cereblon knock-down causes similar
effects as thalidomide treatment, and that teratogenicity can be rescued
via overexpression of a cereblon mutant deficient in thalidomide binding.6 This suggests that cereblon must be present to
recognize one or more endogenous substrates to avoid teratogenicity,
and that thalidomide interferes with this recognition. We have now
shown that already the smallest effectors are sufficient to induce
folding of the thalidomide-binding pocket and to invoke teratogenicity
in zebrafish. Without a protruding moiety, these smallest effectors
cannot contribute directly to the recognition of neo-substrates. Consequently,
while different effectors mediate the recognition of different neo-substrates,
their least common denominator is seemingly the preclusion of endogenous
substrates. This in turn suggests that teratogenicity might be ascribed
to endogenous substrates.

Implications for Medicinal Chemistry
The modulation
of the cereblon-CRL4A E3 ligase ubiquitination behavior is already
exploited in different clinical settings. Apart from the classical
IMiDs that recruit certain neo-substrates to cereblon, targeted protein
degradation mediated by IMiD-derived PROTACs via cereblon is an especially
promising avenue. For both approaches, our structural und functional
characterization yields important insights. So far, IMiDs and IMiD-derived
PROTACs were based on thalidomide. Our results allow for a more rational
design of future cereblon effectors based on optimized minimal binding
moieties: they allow for the design of effectors of lower molecular
weight, with less hydrogen bond donors, and acceptors, and improved
water solubility, which facilitates the formal compliance with the
classical “rule of five” of druglikeness.33 Although the basic mechanisms are not fully
understood yet, the choice of binding moieties not derived from thalidomide
might have the potential to circumvent cereblon-mediated teratogenicity.
Incidentally, our work implies a strategy for the circumvention of
cereblon binding via negative design for future pharmaceuticals.

Materials and Methods
FRET Assay
The FRET-based binding
assay was performed
using the MsCI4WW/FF protein as described previously.25 Briefly, the assay is based on the reporter
ligand MANT-uracil, which has a MANT fluorophore coupled to a uracil
ring as a binding moiety. The MANT fluorophore forms a FRET pair with
the tryptophans of the thalidomide-binding pocket, and out-competition
of MANT-uracil by a test compound is detected by loss of the FRET
effect. For each test compound, titration series with 16 concentrations
were evaluated. As dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was found to have a detrimental
effect in the assay, the final DMSO concentration had to be kept below
an upper limit of 0.03%.25 Hence, wherever
possible, stock solutions of test compounds were prepared in water.
This was not possible for aminoglutethimide, dasabuvir, dantrolene,
dexetimide, lidanserin, nitrofurantoin, and rolipram. For two of these
seven compounds, aminoglutethimide and lidanserin, this could be circumvented
by using acetonitrile as an alternative solvent.25 For the other five compounds, the FRET assay could not
be conducted. IC50 values were determined by applying a
log(dose) response curve on averaged data obtained from three independent
measurements and Ki values calculated
according to the Cheng–Prusoff equation. All substances are
summarized in Table S1 together with their Ki values for MsCI4; the individual curves are
presented in Figure S3.

Crystallography
For structural ligand binding studies
with wild-type MsCI4, orthorhombic MsCI4·thalidomide co-crystals
were reproduced according to ref (10), with a reservoir solution containing 100 mM
sodium acetate pH 4.6 and 15% (w/v) poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) 20 000. These crystals contain
3 monomers of MsCI4·thalidomide in the asymmetric
unit in space group P212121. To exchange thalidomide for other ligands, crystals were
transferred into droplets of reservoir solution supplemented with
15% (v/v) PEG 300 and 10 mM of either aminoglutethimide, γ-butyrolactam,
ethosuximide, glutarimide, hydantoin, thiazolidinedione, 2-thiohydantoin,
or δ-valerolactam, or with solid rolipram. After 40 h of soaking,
these crystals were loop-mounted and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Data were collected at 100 K and a wavelength of 1 Å on a PILATUS
6M-F detector at beamline X10SA of the Swiss Light Source (PSI, Villigen,
Switzerland). Diffraction images were indexed, integrated, and scaled
using XDS.34 All structures were solved
on the basis of the MsCI4·thalidomide coordinates (PDB: 4V2Y) and finalized by
cyclic manual modeling with Coot35 and
refinement with REFMAC5.36 Data collection and refinement statistics are
summarized together with PDB accession codes in Table S2. All molecular depictions were prepared using MolScript,37 BobScript,38 and
Raster3D.39

In-Vivo Zebrafish Assay
The zebrafish pectoral fin
deformity assay was performed as described previously.10 The length of the pectoral fins was measured
using self-developed software, which allows curvature determination
in a semi-automatic fashion. The deformity was classified as “no
effect” for fins exceeding 85% of the control length, “mild”
for fins corresponding to 75–85% of the control length, “medium”
for fins shortened to 60–75%, and “severe” for
fins shorter than 60% of the control length. In first experiments,
we tested concentrations of 200 and 400 μM thalidomide to compare
the phenotypes. As a phenotype was not clearly identifiable at 200 μM in our experimental setup, we settled
on a concentration of 400 μM, which is also consistent with
the experiments of Ito et al.6 Glutarimide,
hydantoin, succinimide, and ethosuximide were all tested at this concentration,
in comparison to the nonbinder barbiturate. The experiments were performed
in direct succession of our experiments with thalidomide and nucleosides,
by the same person and under identical experimental conditions,10 in accordance with institutional guidelines
as defined by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee for U.S.
institutions.
