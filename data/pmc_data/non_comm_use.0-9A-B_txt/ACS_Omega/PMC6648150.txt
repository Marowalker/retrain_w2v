We succeeded in quantitatively detecting
the disappearance of catechin
antioxidant ability as a function of time using near-infrared (NIR)
absorbance and NIR photoluminescence (PL) spectra of single-walled
carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) wrapped with DNA molecules (DNA–SWNT
hybrids). When 15 μg/mL of catechin was added to the oxidized
hybrid suspension, the absorbance of SWNTs increased, according to
the antioxidant ability of catechin, and the effect was maintained
at least for 30 min. When catechin concentrations were less than 0.3
μg/mL, SWNT absorbance gradually decreased, although it increased
when catechin is added. The results revealed that disappearance of
the catechin effects could be quantitatively detected by NIR absorbance
spectra. When NIR PL was employed, the disappearance of PL intensity
was also observed in the case of low catechin concentrations. However,
time-lapse measurement of the disappearance was difficult because
the PL intensity was rapidly quenched. In addition, the optical responses
were different due to different chirality of SWNTs. Our results suggested
that both NIR absorbance and PL can detect disappearance of catechin
antioxidant effects; in particular, slow response of NIR absorbance
was effective to detect time dependence of the disappearance of the
catechin effects. Contrarily, PL revealed huge and rapid responses
in contrast to NIR absorbance. PL might be effective for reversible
use of DNA–SWNT hybrids as a nanobiosensor.

==== Body
Introduction
Near-infrared (NIR)
absorption spectra of single-walled carbon
nanotubes (SWNTs) are sensitive against structural and physicochemical
changes of SWNTs.1−3 For example, it is known that NIR absorbance is weakened
when SWNTs are oxidized.4 NIR photoluminescence
(PL) from SWNTs by irradiation with visible lights is also fluctuated
according to structures of SWNTs and changes of sample conditions.5−18 These unique optical responses of SWNTs can therefore be applied
to various biological applications.19−27 Especially, nanobiosensing that uses SWNT unique optical properties
is one of the promising approaches, and attachment of biomolecules
onto DNA–SWNTs to functionalize the hybrids has been intensively
studied by many research groups.28−39

For example, Zhao et al. proposed an impressive strategy for
nanobiosensing
in 2015.40 First, DNA-wrapped SWNT suspensions
(DNA–SWNT hybrids) were prepared as usual. In their study,
DNA was only used to solubilize SWNTs. Second, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), hydroxyl radicals, caffeine, regular coffee,
and decaffeinated coffee were added to the DNA–SWNT suspension.
They found that a specific peak of NIR absorption spectra that originated
from (10, 5) SWNTs of the DNA–SWNT hybrids significantly decreased
in the presence of oxidants such as H2O2 or
hydroxyl radicals. (10, 5) defines the chirality of a specific SWNT
that is sensitive to oxidation/reduction. In contrast, in the presence
of reductants such as coffee and caffeine, the NIR peaks were significantly
recovered.

Strano’s group published many papers of biological
sensing
using SNNTs. Especially, chirality effects on PL spectra were one
of their recent targets.41−46 Xu et al. studied effect of H2O2, glucose,
and glucose oxidase (GOx) on NIR absorbance of DNA–SWNT hybrids.4 Tu et al. also reported changes in NIR absorbance
with H2O2 addition under various pH conditions.47 Kurnosov et al. studied effects of cysteine
on DNA–SWNT hybrids and other related important biological
molecules.38 Kruss et al. employed hybrids
of polymers and SWNTs including DNA; Polo et al. covered SWNTs with
various polymers and found DNA and other polymers behave in different
manner.31,48,49 Nanobiosensing
using SWNTs became an attractive research subject.50−52

We reported
detection of antioxidant effects of Japanese tea and
catechin using both NIR absorption spectra and NIR PL spectra.53 Catechin is one of the major components of Japanese
tea. We found that the effects can be well detected by both of the
spectra. In particular, change of PL spectra was much drastic than
that of NIR absorbance spectra. However, concentrations of catechin
and tea were fixed at 15 μg/mL in that report.

In this
study, we detected the disappearance of antioxidant properties
of catechin when low concentrations of catechin solutions were employed.
Variously diluted catechin solutions were added to DNA–SWNT
hybrids, and reduction of SWNTs was evaluated by analysis of NIR absorption
and NIR PL spectra. Although stable recovery of NIR peaks was observed
with 15 μg/mL of catechin as we reported previously, recovered
NIR peaks decreased again as a function of time with diluted catechin
solutions.

Results and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
NIR absorbance spectra of DNA–SWNT hybrids before and after
incubating with various concentrations of catechin. The hybrids were
first oxidized with H2O2 (final concentration
0.03%) for 20 min, and the catechin solution was then injected. The
blue line in Figure 1 indicates the absorbance in the absence of catechin and, therefore,
the absorbance of oxidized SWNTs. Then, various concentrations of
catechin solutions were added to the samples, and then, NIR absorbance
spectra were measured after 2 min (gold line), 10 min (yellow line),
20 min (orange line), and 30 min (green line). As a result, a peak
around 1260 nm that was E11 of (10, 5)/(8, 7) SWNTs revealed clear
responses (see the arrow in Figure 1a).54,55 When the final concentration
of catechin was 15 μg/mL, the absorbance increased 143.6% after
2 min against that of oxidized samples. We also continuously measured
time dependence of NIR absorbance spectra only with H2O2 as shown in Figure S1.

Figure 1 NIR absorbance
spectra of DNA–SWNT hybrids in the presence
or absence of catechin. Catechin concentration ranged from 0 to 15
μg/mL. (a) 15, (b) 1.5, (c) 0.3, (d) 0.15, (e) 0.015, and (f)
0.0015 μg/mL. Blue line: DNA–SWNTs oxidized with 0.03%
H2O2 solution for 20 min. Then, the oxidized
DNA–SWNTs were incubated with catechin for 2 min (gold line),
10 min (yellow line), 20 min (orange line), and 30 min (green line).
The arrow indicates the peak of (10, 5)/(8, 7) SWNTs. The absorbance
values represent the mean of three independent measurements.

Numerical values are shown in Table 1. If the initial absorbance
of (10, 5)/(8, 7) was defined
as 100%, the absorbance value after 20 min incubation with H2O2 was 81.3% in the case of 15 μg/mL of catechin.
The value after incubation for 2 min with catechin was 116.7%. It
is clear that NIR absorbance of (10, 5)/(8, 7) was decreased with
H2O2 and recovered with catechin. Even after
incubating for 30 min with catechin, the absorbance peak did not decrease
again. Thus, gold, yellow, orange, and green lines were completely
overlapped in Figure 1a. It suggests that antioxidant effects of 15 μg/mL of catechin
were enough strong at least for 30 min.

When the catechin concentration
was 1.5 μg/mL, the peak slightly
decreased after 30 min (Figure 1b). Based on the numerical analysis in Table 1, the value increased to 102.4 and 113.1%
for (9, 4) and (10, 5)/(8, 7), respectively, against that of the initial
suspension when the sample was incubated with catechin for 2 min.
However, after 30 min incubation, it was 109.1%. This decrease was
more clearly observed when 0.3 μg/mL of catechin was added to
the sample (Figure 1c). The peak around 1260 nm gradually decreased due to incubation.
The data suggest that 0.3 μg/mL of catechin was enough to recover
the absorbance spectra of DNA–SWNTs once; however, the recovery
effects were limited. The effects of catechin were gradually weakened
due to concentrations of catechin (Figure 1c–f). After all, when 0.0015 μg/mL
of catechin was used, significant recovery was not observed even in
2 min incubation (Figure 1f). From the numerical analysis in Table 1, when the catechin concentrations were 0.15
and 0.015 μg/mL for 2 min incubation, recovery ratios in (10,
5)/(8, 7) were 99.0 and 86.9%, respectively, and those in (9, 4) and
(10, 5)/(8, 7) were 99.2 and 94.3%, respectively. Although the absorbance
values were increased compared to those with H2O2, the values were reached to the initial state (without H2O2 and catechin). Although the mechanism of this decrease
is not clear at this moment, as one possibility, H2O2 or O2 in the sample was competitive against catechin.

Figure 2 shows NIR
PL spectra of similar samples before and after incubating with various
concentrations of catechin. NIR PL spectra only with H2O2 are shown in Figure S2.
Excitation wavelength was 730 nm in Figures 2 and S2. NIR PL
spectra with excitation wavelength 740 nm are shown in Figure S3. PL maps of related samples were studied
in our previous paper, and we found that several clear PL spots were
obtained by 730 nm excitation.53 For this
reason, we focused on excitation at 730 and 740 nm in this paper.
By focusing on the narrow range of the excitation wavelengths, time-lapse
measurements were available although it takes time to obtain PL maps.
Numerical analysis for 730 and 740 nm excitation is shown in Tables 2 and S2, respectively. PL intensity increased 446.7%
against that of initial suspension in the case of (8, 6) SWNTs when
15 μg/mL of catechin was added (see the arrow in Figure 2a). Comparing with oxidized
SWNTs with 20 min incubation with H2O2, it was
a 3350.0% increase. As we reported in our previous paper, PL sensitivity
was much higher than that of NIR absorbance.53 In the case of PL, luminous efficiency is affected by electron density.
Thus, the efficiency should be decreased when SWNTs are oxidized.
This might be one of the reasons of high recovery in PL.56−63

In addition, PL recovery of (8,
6) is larger than that of (9, 4),
(8, 7), and (10, 2). For example, recovery ratios of (8, 6) with 15,
1.5, and 0.3 μg/mL of catechin for 2 min incubation were 446.7,
423.5, and 330.8%, respectively; those of (9, 4) with 15, 1.5, and
0.3 μg/mL of catechin for 2 min incubation were 250.7, 264.9,
and 240.7%, respectively; those of (8, 7) with 15, 1.5, and 0.3 μg/mL
of catechin for 2 min incubation were 400.0, 362.5, and 250.0%, respectively;
and those of (10, 2) with 15, 1.5, and 0.3 μg/mL of catechin
for 2 min incubation were 190.7, 201.7, and 189.4%, respectively.
It is known that diameters of (9, 4), (8, 6), (8, 7), and (10, 2)
are 0.916, 0.966, 1.032, and 0.884 nm, respectively.17 The PL data roughly suggested that thin SWNTs are more
sensitive although the order of (9, 4) and (8, 6) is not reasonable.

When diluted catechin solution was used, limitation of catechin
effects also appeared in PL spectra as well as in absorbance spectra.
For example, in the case of 0.3 μg/mL of catechin, PL intensity
of (8, 6) increased 330.8% against the initial suspension for 2 min
incubation with catechin. However, the values were 100.0, 30.8, and
23.1% for 10, 20, and 30 min incubation with catechin. A similar decrease
according to incubation time was observed in (9, 4), (8, 7), and (10,
2) when the catechin concentrations were less than 0.3 μg/mL.

Interestingly, NIR absorbance had longer lifetime than PL when
diluted catechin solution was employed. We can compare the results
about (9, 4) because (9, 4) was measured in both absorbance and PL.
In the case of 0.15 μg/mL of catechin, NIR absorbance values
were 90.2, 99.2, 93.5, 91.9, and 91.1% against the initial suspension
for 20 min incubation with H2O2, 2 min with
catechin, 10 min with catechin, 20 min with catechin, and 30 min with
catechin, respectively. On the other hand, PL intensities were 10.5,
64.5, 14.5, 11.8, and 11.8% against the initial suspension for 20
min incubation with H2O2, 2 min with catechin,
10 min with catechin, 20 min with catechin, and 30 min with catechin,
respectively. Recovery of NIR absorbance continued at least for 30
min although the values were gradually decreased. Instead, PL intensity
dramatically decreased after 10 min incubation with catechin (14.5%),
although there was a significant recovery for 2 min incubation (64.5%).

Comparison of NIR absorbance of (10, 5)/(8, 7) and PL of (8, 7)
at 0.15 μg/mL of catechin provides more clear difference. In
NIR absorbance, values were 78.6, 99.0, 84.7, 80.6, and 79.6% against
the initial suspension for 20 min incubation with H2O2, 2 min with catechin, 10 min with catechin, 20 min with catechin,
and 30 min with catechin, respectively. PL intensities were 50.0,
87.5, 50.0, 50.0, and 50.0% against the initial suspension for 20
min incubation with H2O2, 2 min with catechin,
10 min with catechin, 20 min with catechin, and 30 min with catechin,
respectively. In this case, NIR absorbance of (10, 5)/(8, 7) well
detected the time-lapse decrease; however, PL was not suitable to
detect time dependence because the decrease was too fast. As we discussed
the above, PL intensity of oxidized SWNTs is strongly inhibited due
to the decrease of density of electric states. It might be one of
the reasons of low sensitivity of PL monitoring when catechin concentrations
were low.

Figure 3 shows summary
of time dependence of the NIR absorbance ((10, 5)/(8, 7) SWNTs) and
NIR PL ((9, 4) SWNTs). These chiralities were selected to indicate
the best performance of absorbance and PL methods. In the NIR absorbance,
absorbance values were stable even after 30 min incubation when 15
μg/mL of catechin was employed. Even with 1.5 μg/mL, decrease
of absorbance values was not huge. Contrarily, in the case of PL intensity,
even with 15 and 1.5 μg/mL of catechin, the PL intensity gradually
decreased during 30 min incubation. When diluted catechin solutions
(0.015 and 0.0015 μg/mL of catechin) were used, it was hard
to monitor time dependence of intensity values. In summary, when catechin
concentration was high (15 μg/mL), PL spectra was suitable to
detect the catechin effects clearly. Contrarily, when the catechin
concentration was low (less than 0.15 μg/mL), NIR absorbance
was suitable to well detect the time dependence of catechin effects.

of (a) NIR absorbance values of (10, 5)/(8, 7)
SWNTs and (b) NIR PL intensities of (9, 4) SWNTs. The value at 0 min
reveals the values before adding catechin. After adding catechin,
the values were measured after incubation 2, 10, 20, and 30 min. Catechin
concentrations were 15 μg/mL (red line), 1.5 μg/mL (yellow
line), 0.3 μg/mL (green line), 0.15 μg/mL (sky blue line),
0.015 μg/mL (dark blue line), and 0.0015 μg/mL (black
line).

Several discussions are available
based on the above experimental
results. First, our results suggest that spectral change of SWNTs
caused by catechin was reversible because the catechin effects disappeared
as a function of time with diluted catechin solutions. If structures
or physicochemical properties of SWNTs were permanently changed by
catechin, the catechin effect should be continued for longer time.
This is one of the important points for biosensing applications of
SWNTs because it suggests that reversible use of DNA–SWNT hybrids
is available. There are many future research themes in near future.
For example, detailed evaluation of reversibility of time-lapse measurement
is necessary. Interactions among catechin, DNA, and H2O2 will be evaluated.

Second, the speed of disappearance
of catechin effects is much
faster in PL in contrast to that in absorbance. Probably, the mechanism
to produce PL is more complicated than absorbance; thus, PL might
be easily disappeared. But the reason of this difference is not easy
to explain. For practical viewpoint, it looks that both PL and absorbance
have different advantages. Rapid response of PL is suitable to expect
reversible use of DNA–SWNT hybrids for nanobiosensing. It is
not necessary to wait a long time to start the second measurements.
In contrast, for analysis of relaxation process of SWNT spectra, absorbance
has advantages over PL because absorbance peaks gradually decreased.

Third, redox potentials of each molecule are probably important
factors to understand the observed phenomena.64−66 Reduction potential
of H2O2 is around 1.7 V and that of catechin
is less than 0.1 V. Although reduction potential of SWNTs is varied
due to their chiralities, it is much higher than those of catechin
and H2O2. For example, the potential of (9,
4) was reported to be around 4 V. The difference of the potentials
is reasonable to explain our spectral data.

In summary, our
data revealed disappearance of catechin effects
by both absorbance and PL for the first time. This provides helpful
information to establish nanobiosensing technology using DNA–SWNT
hybrids.

Conclusions
We demonstrated quantitative detection
of disappearance of antioxidant
effects of catechin using DNA–SWNT hybrids in an aqueous solution.
We found that both NIR absorbance spectra and PL spectra could detect
the disappearance of the effects when the catechin concentration was
less than 0.3 μg/mL. On the other hand, quenching speed of PL
intensity was much faster than NIR absorbance. The slow response of
NIR absorbance was useful for time-lapse measurements of the disappearance
of the catechin effects. Our results indicated a potential of time-lapse
nanobiosensing using DNA–SWNT hybrids.

Materials and Methods
SWNTs produced by the high-pressure carbon monooxide (HiPco) method
were obtained from Unidym Inc. (Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Deoxyribonucleic
acid sodium salt from salmon testes (D1626, dsDNA) was bought from
Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). H2O2 (abt. 30%, 084-07441) and epigallocatechin gallate (553-74471, catechin)
were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).

DNA was dissolved in 10 mM tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris-HCl
buffer solution, pH 7.3). DNA concentration was 1 mg/mL. To prepare
a uniform DNA solution, it was sonicated in an ultrasonic bath (80
W) for 90 min on ice. Finally, the DNA solution was gently shaken
for 3 h. Catechin was dissolved in pure water (1.5 mg/mL) and stored
after gentle shaking.

SWNT (powder, 0.5 mg) and DNA solution
(1 mL, pH 7.3) were mixed
and sonicated for 2 h using a probe-type sonicator (3 W) on ice.53 The supernatant was stored as the DNA–SWNT
suspension after centrifugation at 15 000 rpm (17 360g) for 3 h at 8 °C.

NIR absorption spectra were measured
by SolidSpec-3700DUV (Shimadzu
Co., Kyoto, Japan). NIR PL spectra were obtained by NIR-PL System
(Shimadzu Co., Kyoto, Japan). Measurement procedures were similar
in both absorbance and PL spectroscopy. DNA–SWNT suspension
(50 μL) and Tris-HCl buffer solution (930 μL) were mixed
in a sample tube and deaerated by nitrogen gas. The NIR spectrum of
the mixture was measured in a quartz cuvette with sealing. After measuring
the initial spectra, H2O2 solution was added
to the mixture (final concentration 0.03%, 8.8 mM), and NIR spectra
were then measured after 2 and 20 min of incubation at 21 °C.
Finally, 10 μL of the catechin solution was added to the samples
(the final concentration was 15, 1.5, 0.3, 0.15, 0.015, or 0.0015
μg/mL), and the spectra were measured again after 2, 10, 20,
and 30 min of incubation at 21 °C. Molar concentrations of catechin
were 33, 3.3, 0.33, 0.033, and 0.0033 μM. Molar concentration
of H2O2 was much higher than that of catechin.
Each experiment was repeated three times to verify the reproducibility.
The obtained NIR spectra were normalized to an adsorption wavelength
of 730.5–732.25 nm (E22 of (9, 4)). Assignments of chirality
of each SWNT were carried out based on several previous papers.54,55
