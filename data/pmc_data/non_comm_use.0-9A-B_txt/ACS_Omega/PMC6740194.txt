The
essential oil (EO) composition of the aerial parts of Erigeron multiradiatus (Lindl.ex DC.) Benth growing
wild in the central Himalayan region of Uttarakhand, India, was analyzed
by capillary gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector and
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. A sum of 12 constituents
was identified, representing 97.81% of the oil composition. The oil
was composed mainly of oxygenated monoterpenes (88.95%), sesquiterpene
hydrocarbons (5.61%), oxygenated sesquiterpenes (3.05%), and monoterpene
hydrocarbons (0.20%). Major constituents identified were trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester (77.79%), cis-lachnophyllum ester (11.04%), zingiberene (4.43%), and spathulenol
(1.59%). Further, the leishmanicidal effect of EO and the purified
compound trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester
has been investigated against Leishmania donovani promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes. EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester were safer for the hamster
peritoneal macrophage and lethal to promastigotes and intracellular
amastigotes at different concentrations. Further, using an in silico
approach, these four compounds were tested against 10 major proteins
of L. donovani associated with its
virulence. Out of them, only trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester was found to be effective against the four target
proteins, namely, l-asparaginase-1-like protein, metacaspase
2, metacaspase 1, and DNA topoisomerase II of L. donovani. The results indicate that EO contains trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester as a major component and showed antileishmanial
activity which may facilitate discovery of new lead molecules for
developing herbal medicines against visceral leishmaniasis.

1 Introduction
Visceral
leishmaniasis (VL) is caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, which causes a fatal systemic
infection. The disease is transmitted by a female sandfly (Phlebotominae).
It is endemic in 62 countries of the developing world, and with an
estimated population of 200 million at risk. Every year more than
100 000 new cases of VL are reported in India, and more than
90% of these cases are reported in the state of Bihar.1 The control of leishmaniasis is not available yet due to
the lack of effective vaccines and the disease control relies on chemotherapy
with pentavalent antimonials which require long-term treatment and
cause serious side effects.2 Some of the
latest drugs such as miltefosine and liposomal amphotericin B are
effective but are extortionate. Along with the toxicity and severe
side effects, numerous relapse are also a major concern. Thus based
on the present clinical scenario it is desirable to develop new antileishmanial
agents from natural products which are productive, cost effective
and less toxic.2−4

The use of traditional medical practices, their
validation and
discovery of natural drugs could provide a new dimension for the treatment
and control of leishmaniasis.3,5,6 Different aerial and underground parts of plants are commonly used
to isolate essential oils (EOs) in folk medicine to treat various
types of diseases.7 Recently antileishmanial
properties have also been explored using EOs of Cymbopogon
citratus (DC) Stapf (Poaceae),8Chenopodium ambrosioides L. (Chenopodiaceae),9 and Vanillosmopsis arborea (Gardner) Baker (Asteraceae).10

Erigeron multiradiatus (Lindl.ex
DC.) Benth. &Hook.f. (Asteraceae) is a natural inhabitant of the
mountainous regions of India, Nepal, China, and Afghanistan. E. multiradaitus also known by its vernacular name
“meiduoluomi” by traditional healers and native people,
have been extensively used to cure hepatitis, meningitis, hemiparalysis,
enteritis, diarrhea, adenolymphitis, rheumatism, and polyneuritis
in traditional Tibetan medicine.11,12 Further, there
are several reports on Erigeron spp.
viz. Erigeron canadensis having antibacterial
properties,13Erigeron annuus with antimicrobial activity,14Erigeron floribundus with antitrypanosomal15 and antiplasmodial activity,16 and Erigeron breviscapus widely used in Cameroonian traditional medicine, reported with analgesic,
immunomodulatory, trypanocidal, antidermatophytes, anti-inflammatory,
antifungal, and antiplasmodial activity,15,17−21 Moreover the role of Erigeron spp.
have also been reported to inhibit platelet aggregation, improve microcirculation,
dilation of blood vessel, increase cerebral blood flow,22−24 treat dental pain, angina, headache, female infertility, and AIDS.17,18,25−27 More importantly, E. multiradiatus having antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory
activity,11,28 but no study has been reported on its antileishmanial
potential to support their traditional folk medicinal use. E. multiradiatus collected from various regions unlocked
the existence of several bioactive constituents namely matricaria
ester, α-pinene, lachnophyllum ester, myrcene, β-(E)-ocimene, isoledene, α-copaene, β-cubebene, p-menthatriene, caryophyllene oxide, α-cadinol, camphene,
limonene, and β-eudesmol.14,29,30

In this study, we have reported the isolation of EO of E. multiradiatus, identification and purification
of trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester
and further evaluation of its cytotoxicity and antileishmanial potential
against L. donovani. In addition, in
silico screening of the components of EOs together with the miltefosine
reference antileishmanial agent was done on four vital parasitic enzymes,
namely, l-asparaginase-1-like protein, metacaspase-2, metacaspase-1,
and DNA topoisomerase II in order to find out its probable mode of
action.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 EO Composition
The EO was isolated
in a yield of 0.12% (v/w) from different aerial parts of E. multiradiatus and was inspected using gas chromatography
with flame ionization detector (GC-FID) and gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS) (Figure 1A). A sum of 12 components, corresponding to 97.81%
of the total oil has been determined. The retention index of volatile
compounds (RIa and RIb) and their percentage
are summarized in Table 1. Among these, trans-2-cis-8 matricaria
ester was identified as a major compound (77.79%) (Figure 1B) which was further confirmed
by using mass, 1H NMR and 13C NMR spectral data
(Table S1 and Figures S1−S3). The
EO revealed the dominant existence of oxygenated monoterpenes (88.95%)
followed by sesquiterpene hydrocarbons (5.61%) and oxygenated sesquiterpenes
(3.05%). The monoterpene hydrocarbons accounted only for 0.20%. The
other major components are cis-lachnophyllum ester
(11.04%), zingiberene (4.43%), and spathulenol (1.59%) (Figure 2). In an earlier study of E. multiradiatus, trans-2-cis-8 matricaria ester (50.70%) was found as a main constituent,14 while the present study revealed higher amounts
of trans-2-cis-8 matricaria ester
(77.79%). The yield of EO and chemical patterns may be also be influenced
by climatic (light and temperature) and geographic conditions, genetics,
and the growth stage of the collected plants.31,32

2.2 In Vitro
Antileishmanial Activity
None of the promising therapeutic
treatments are available against
fatal VL. Therefore, it is an urgent need to identify the promising
antileishmanial candidate. In the search of new potent antileishmania
agents, we have used the in vitro and in silico approach in this study
extensively.

2.2.1 EO and trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria Ester Inhibit the Growth of L. donovani Promastigotes
The effect of
EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester was evaluated against the promastigote form of L. donovani (Dd8) by MTT assay, which significantly
reduced L. donovani viabilities with
IC50 values < 20 μg/mL and <56 μM, respectively.
Incubation of promastigotes with 30 μg/mL of EO and 100 μM
of trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester
resulted in 80.95 ± 3.00 and 91.32 ± 8.48% inhibition, respectively.
While at a concentration of 20 μg/mL or 50 μM the inhibition
was 57.7 ± 6.08 and 48.3 ± 4.98%, respectively in promastigotes
(Table 2). The IC50 value of EO against promastigotes was 18.29 ± 2.1 μg/mL
and that for trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester was 55.09 ± 6.4 μM (Table 3). The number of viable promastigotes was
significantly reduced (P < 0.001) in all tested
concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 μg/mL) of EO as well as trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester (5, 10,
25, 50, 75, 100 μM) in comparison to the untreated control (the
coefficient of the variation range was 3–11%). Miltefosine
as a positive control almost completely inhibited parasite proliferation
(Figure 3A).

of infected macrophages. The bar diagrams show the % viability of
promastigotes or the number of amastigotes per 100 macrophages. The
% viability of promastigotes was determined by MTT assay after 72
h exposure with varying concentrations of test compounds. Cell viability
was expressed as the proportion of absorbance values normalized to
the untreated control group after subtracting the blank absorbance
from the sample and control. The percentage of intracellular amastigotes
per 100 macrophages was determined microscopically after incubation
with different concentrations of the test compounds or the positive
control miltefosine (3.6 μM) for 72 h. There were three replicates
in each experiment, and the data are the mean ± SD for each concentration.
Significance values indicate the difference between the untreated
groups and treated groups with various concentrations of EO, trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester, or miltefosine
(***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01;
*, p < 0.05).

2.2.2 Investigation
of Possible Cytotoxic Effects
of EO and trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria
Ester on Hamster Peritoneal Macrophage
Different concentrations
of EO and the purified compound trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester exhibited no cytotoxicity on hamster peritoneal
macrophages; even the higher concentrations were safe without the
sign of cell deformity. The CC50 value of EO against peritoneal
macrophages was 285 ± 21 μg/mL and that for trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester was 609 ± 71 μM
(Table 3). Further,
the safety of the therapeutic agents was evaluated by the selectivity
index (SI), which was expressed by the CC50/IC50 ratio. The SI value for EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester was higher than 10 (Table 3), so the treatment was considered
as safe for the cells (hamster peritoneal macrophages) at different
therapeutic concentrations.

2.2.3 EO
and trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria Ester
Inhibit the Growth of L. donovani Intracellular
Amastigote Forms
To check the activity of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester on intracellular
amastigotes, hamster
peritoneal macrophages were infected with L. donovani and allowed to grow at different concentrations of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester. The number
of amastigotes/100 macrophages was counted microscopically, and the
results were expressed as a percentage inhibition as compared to the
control (Figure 3B,C).
Interestingly all the tested concentrations of EO (5, 10, 15, 20,
25, 30 μg/mL) and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100 μM) were found
to inhibit amastigote growth and resulted in 12.40 ± 1.47 to
75.00 ± 8.30% and 4.8 ± 0.47 to 85.10 ± 8.90% inhibition,
respectively (p < 0.001), while the positive control
(3.6 μM) lowered the parasite load in the infected macrophages
by 82.31% (p < 0.001) compared to the untreated
controls (Table 2).
The IC50 value of EO against intracellular amastigotes
was 20.19 ± 2.4 μg/mL and for trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester was 61.2 ± 7.9 μM (Table 3). Different concentrations
of the EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester were nontoxic to the hamster peritoneal macrophages and effective
on intracellular amastigotes which indicated the selectivity of EO
and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester
against amastigotes as compared to mammalian cells, as analyzed by
qualitative microscopic examination. Thus, the outcome signifies the
selectivity of EO and its major component trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester toward amastigotes as compared to
the host cells.

As it is evident from the results, EO and its
component trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester provided a hindrance against both the promastigote and intracellular
amastigote forms of L. donovani. This
plant has antileishmanial potential which is almost similar to the
standard drugs and possesses several medicinal properties, and because
of easy oral administration, it could provide a good lead over currently
available antileishmanial drugs and has to be investigated in more
detail during different stages of drug development.

2.3 In Silico Study
At present, in silico
practices have wide application in the development and analysis of
pharmacological hypothesis. These methods are prominently involved
in identification and optimization of novel molecules, and having
a great understanding on a target thus reduces the time to clarify
absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity properties
as well as physicochemical characterization.

So in this study,
to identify the probable targets and to understand the probable mode
of action of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester, molecular docking was carried out.

2.3.1 Molecular
Docking Interaction Analysis Divulges
the Highest Binding Affinity of trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria Ester against the Selected Leishmania Target Proteins
The oil consisted mainly of oxygenated
monoterpenes and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria-ester
was a major constituent identified. Further, in order to identify
the free energy accountable for complex generation and to identify
the molecular interactions responsable for this target-specific inhibition,
we have carried out molecular docking analysis for 4 major components
of EO against 10 major proteins of the parasite. Ligprep yields stable
test ligand structures by altering the ring conformations of the Lewis
structures, and providing stable protonation conditions. Two indispensable
terms, a 3D structure of the protein and a ligand stock are entails
in molecular docking analysis. A 3D structure of l-asparaginase-1-like
protein (CBZ32861.1), metacaspase-2 (ABD19718.1), metacaspase-1 (ABD19717.1),
and DNA topoisomerase II (AAD34021.1) of L. donovani was generated with the help of homology modeling. The 3D structure
generated by homology modeling needs to be revised as it might be
deficient of necessary hydrogen and have excess water. Hence, hydrogen
atoms are additionally incorporated into the structure, so that a
correct ionization and precise tautomeric form is maintained. Once
the protein structure is modeled, validation is carried out by Ramachandran
plot generation. The Ramachandran plot for 4 proteins (metacaspase-2,
metacaspase-1, l-asparaginase-1-like protein, and DNA topoisomerse
II) performing best result is included in Figure 4. SiteMap gives knowledge about the binding
sites in the receptor protein. The site score for all 10 protein binding
sites for each protein should be greater than 1 for druggability.
While for differentiating ligand binding and nonbinding sites, the
borderline site score is 0.80. In order to predict the effect of test
compounds on different leishmanial proteins, we performed molecular
docking interaction analysis (Table 4). The docking score corresponds to its free energy
involved in “binding”. The entire attribute and genuineness
of the model were found appropriate for the study. Molecular docking
study revealed that trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester was the only ligand that performed phenomenal binding affinity
against four different protein molecules (Figure 5). Figure 5A–D represents interaction of ligands that manifest
various interacting amino acid residues at the ligand-binding site
of a protein. In Figure 5A, hydrogen bonding was clearly observed between the ligand and the
ASP 117 and ARG 195 residue of l-asparaginase-1-like protein.
Similarly hydrogen bonding was seen between the ligand and other amino
acid residues of the proteins of L. donovani (Figure 5B–D).
The higher the hydrogen bond, the stronger will be the interaction
between the ligand and receptor. Other than trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester, no other ligand showed
activity and interaction with any proteins. The binding energy score
of trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester
was −4.803, −4.152, −4.083, and −3.741
kcal/mol for L. donovanil-asparaginase-1-like protein, metacaspase 2, metacaspase 1, and DNA
topoisomerse II, respectively, which was significantly higher than
the positive control miltefosine with a docking score of −3.835, −3.821, −3.495,
and −3.158 for l-asparaginase-1-like protein, metacaspase
2, metacaspase 1, and DNA topoisomerse II, respectively. Thus the
results manifest that trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester showed the highest binding affinity for l-asparaginase-1-like protein while the binding energy of metacaspase-2,
metacaspase-1, and DNA topoisomerse II were stronger than other proteins.
Metacaspase is essential for chromosomal separation and survival of
the parasite.33 DNA topoisomerases are
the key enzymes that facilitate high precision DNA transactions inside
the parasite,34 and l-asparginases
are associated with the survival of the parasite.35 The major EO component, trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester represents a good inhibitory effect
on the four major essential parasite proteins with nontoxic properties.
So these enzymes could be used as a potential drug target against
the pathogen Leishmania.

was quantitatively analyzed and the values resulted were 92.2% most
favoured core regions, 6.8% allowed or favourable regions and only
1% is present generously allowed and disallowed regions.

2.3.2 ADME Profile of the Test Ligand
Pharmacokinetic
comparative analysis of the test ligand depicts the
fitness of the ligand as a drug as compared to the standard drug miltefosine
(Table 5). Most of
the absorption parameters suggest that the solubility and permeability
of the ligand be in accordance with the control’s value. Distribution
parameters include renal organic cation transporters, P-glycoprotein and plasma protein binding (log PPB). Metabolism data
included the substrate and inhibition analysis of various drug metabolism
enzymes belonging to the CYP450 enzyme superfamily. Excretion parameters
include Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell lines on in silico levels.36

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have identified the chemical components of EO of E. multiradiatus and evaluated its antileishmanial
potential against L. donovani. The
results show that the EO of E. multiradiatus exhibits leishmanicidal activity in vitro against L. donovani and that this activity is related to
the presence of its major compound trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester. This major compound, trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester, manifests more than 77%
of the composition of EO, and when tested separately, it also exhibited
similar or more leishmanicidal activity. Further, in silico study
revealed that trans-2-cis-8-matricaria
ester may be an effective inhibitor of the four pathogenic proteins
of Leishmania with nontoxic properties
that could be further employed for in vivo examination and may enhance
the pace of herbal drug development, which may be a better option for alternate
chemotherapy against VL.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Plant Materials
The plant material
was collected in the month of September 2017 (flowering stage) from
the Chiplakedar forest (Pithoragarh District), Uttarakhand, India,
at an altitude of 3000 m with geographical coordinates 29° 96′
N latitudes and 80° 43′ E longitudes. A voucher (specimen
no. 116031) has been deposited at the Herbarium of Botanical Survey
of India, Dehradun, India; and the Department of Chemistry, Kumaun
University, Almora, India.

4.2 Extractions of the EO
Fresh aerial
parts (∼4 kg) were exposed to steam distillation using a copper
still distiller (Scientech, India). The distillate of fresh plant
material was treated with n-hexane and dichloromethane
for thorough extraction of organic components. The dichloromethane
and n-hexane extracts were mixed and dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4. In order to obtain residual oil, solvent
distillation was performed in a rotary vacuum evaporator (Perfit-RV
1240, Buchi type, India). Further using anhydrous sodium sulphate
the oil was allowed to dry, filtered and stored at 4 °C until
its chemical and pharmacological test analysis.

4.3 GC-FID and GC–MS Analysis
A gas chromatographic
analysis of EO was performed on a Shimadzu
GC-2010 Ultra gas chromatograph, Kyoto, Japan, equipped with a flame
ionization detector and an Rtx-5MS fused silica capillary column.
The temperature of the injector and detector were maintained at 260
and 270 °C, respectively. Helium at a flow rate of 1.21 mL/min
and 69.0 kPa inlet pressure was employed as the carrier gas. The sample
(1.0 μL) was injected with 10:1 spilt ratio.

GC–MS
was carried out on Shimadzu GC-MS-QP2010 Ultra, Kyoto, Japan, using
identical oven temperature. The MS was used under the electron impact
conditions (70 eV), ion 230 °C, mass scan mode: 2.41 scan/s,
mass range: 40–650 m/z; a
5% solution of oil in hexane (1.0 μL) was injected. Individual
compounds were identified by calculating retention indices (RI) using
homologous C8–C34 (Supplier—Restek’s
ISO 9001:2008) n-alkane series, compared with available
mass spectral data (NIST 11, Wiley 8 and FFNSC 2) and finally confirmed
by comparing their RI with the available literature.37

4.4 Isolation and Characterization
of trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria Ester
The EO (2 mL) of E. multiradiatus was
subjected to a silica gel column chromatograph (230–400 mesh,
Merck, 20 g) with hexane/diethyl ether (99:1–85:15) as the
eluent and twenty fractions were collected and screened by TLC and
GC to produce the compound (80 mg, >96% purity). The compound was
identified by using mass, 1H NMR and 13C NMR
spectral data.29

4.5 Parasite
and Media
Promastigotes
of L. donovani (Dd8) were cultured
in RPMI-1640 medium (Himedia, India) containing 10% fetal bovine serum
(Cell clone, Genetix, India) along with 1% antibiotic and antimycotic
solution (Cell clone, Genetix, India) at 26 °C.

4.6 Animals
Laboratory inbred female
golden hamsters (Mesocricetus auratus, 45–50 g) were purchased from the Central Drug Research Institute
(CDRI-CSIR), Lucknow, India and were used for experimental purposes.
All animals and experiments were performed in accordance with the
Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments
on Animals (CPCSEA) for the care and use of laboratory animals and
the regulations of Kumaun University, Nainital, India. The use of
animals was approved by the institutional animal care and ethics committee,
and the protocol number is KUDOPS/109. They were kept in a climatically
controlled animal house and fed with a standard rodent food pellet
(Lipton India) and water ad libitum.

4.7 In Vitro
Activity
4.7.1 Evaluation of Inhibition of L. donovani Promastigotes Growth
To determine
the efficacy of the drug log phase, L. donovani promastigotes were used.38 Briefly, 105 parasites/well were plated on 96-well cell culture plates
along with different concentrations of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester and incubated for 72 h
at 26 °C. Then 20 μL of MTT (Himedia, India) stock solution
(5 mg/mL) was mixed into each well and further incubated for 4 hours
then allowed to centrifuge for 10 min at 1000g; the
supernatant was discarded and resuspended with 100 μL (0.5%)
of DMSO (Cell clone, Genetix, India) into each well. Using a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad, India) the OD was measured at 540 nm. Further percentage
of inhibition was calculated by comparing the % viability with the
untreated control. In order to verify the results, tests were performed
in triplicate. Miltefosine was used as a standard control.

4.7.2 Cytotoxicity of EO and trans-2-cis-8-Matricaria Ester in Hamster Peritoneal
Macrophages
The cytotoxicity of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester was evaluated on hamster
peritoneal macrophages. Two hamsters were treated with thioglycollate
in the peritoneal cavity to allow inflammatory response to proceed
for 4 days and then euthanized. Hamster peritoneal macrophages were
resuspended at 105 cells/mL in RPMI medium plated in 16-well
chamber slides (Nalge Nunc, USA) and incubated for 8 days for differentiation
into macrophages in a humidified 5% CO2 air atmosphere
at 37 °C. Further, the differentiated hamster peritoneal macrophages
were incubated with various concentrations of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester for 72 h. The cytotoxicity
of compounds was examined using MTT assay, and cell morphology and
integrity were evaluated under a microscope after Giemsa staining
(Himedia, India).39 To calculate the cytotoxic
concentration (CC50), tests were conducted in triplicate.
SI, which is the ratio of CC50/IC50, manifests
the balance between cytotoxicity and antileishmanial activity. SI
value > 10 is considered to be safe for the cells at various concentrations.

4.7.3 Evaluation of the Inhibitory Effect on Intracellular
Amastigote Growth
Hamster peritoneal macrophages were seeded
and infected with stationary-phase Leishmania promastigotes (at a ratio of 1:10 macrophages to parasites). The
infected macrophages were subjected to grow for 72 h along with various
concentrations of EO and trans-2-cis-8-matricaria ester. Sensitivity was checked microscopically after
Giemsa staining by calculating the burden of amastigotes per 100 macrophages.
Miltefosine was used as the standard positive control. Percentage
of inhibition was calculated as described earlier.40

4.8 In Silico Study
4.8.1 Target Selection
The amino acid
sequences of the target proteins of L. donovani cytoplasmic l-asparaginase-1-like protein (CBZ32861.1), L. donovani metacaspase-2 (ABD19718.1), L. donovani metacaspase-1 (ABD19717.1), and L. donovani DNA topoisomerase II (AAD34021.1) were
retrieved using the database of NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
For interaction analysis of the selected target proteins and ligands,
Schrodinger’s software is used (Schrödinger Release:
Maestro, version 10.5, Schrödinger, LLC, NY 2016-1, USA). This
master software consists of more than one suite that is capable of
performing visualization of the structure, binding site prediction,
and receptor–ligand interaction.

4.8.2 Ligand
Selection and Preparation
The ligands used in this study
were selected from chemical components
of E. multiradiatus EO (Figure 2). The receptors used are significant
proteins, playing a major role in the infection cycle of L. donovani, hence can be used as attractive targets
for targeting leishmaniasis. For ligand preparation, Ligprep application
(v3.7, Schrödinger Release NY 2016-1, USA) was used for rectifying
and stabilizing the structure of the ligand.41

4.8.3 Protein Structure Generation
Structure
of proteins involved in the study was either obtained from RCSB (protein
databank) or generated using models. In the absence of 3D structures
online, we employed the homology modeling approach using PRIME for
modeling of 10 proteins. Hence, the amino acid sequences (FASTA) were
retrieved from UniProt and are reported here (sequence 1). The template
for sequences was generated using BLAST (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the template selected were further modeled to a 3D structure
by Prime (version 7.0, Schrödinger Release NY 2016-1, USA).42

4.8.4 Protein Structure Validation
Determining
the accuracy of the homology modeled 3D structure requires mandatory
validation. This step is called preparation of protein that primarily
includes minimization of energy, removal of water, and addition of
hydrogen bonds. It is facilitated by Protein Preparation Wizard (version
7.0, Schrödinger Release NY 2016-1, USA). Validation of proteins
3D resulted in a refined model structure preceded by generating the
binding sites on the target for the ligand to attach. The binding
site for our target proteins were predicted using SiteMap (version
3.8, Schrödinger release NY 2016-1 USA).

4.8.5 Molecular Docking
A docking study
was carried out to fit ligands and proteins into the predicted binding
site of all the protein targets selected for the study. To evaluate
the interaction and binding affinity between the ligand and receptor
the Glide package was used (version 7.0, Schrödinger Release
NY 2016-1, USA). The size of the docking area was predefined by receptor
grid generation as per the presence of the binding site in respective
protein structures.43

4.8.6 ADME Studies
The pharmacokinetic
profile of the test ligand was analyzed in terms of its absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion. This ADME analysis was carried
out by Qikprop (an application from Schrodinger suite 2016).44

4.9 Statistical Analysis
All experiments
were performed in triplicates and the results were manifested as mean
± SD. Analysis of the results (pooled data of the three experiments)
were performed by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett’s post-test.
All of the analyses were done using GraphPad Prism (version 3.03)
software.
