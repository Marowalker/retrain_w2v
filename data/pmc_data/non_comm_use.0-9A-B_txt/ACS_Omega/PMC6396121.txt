Approximately
15% of all human tumors harbor mutant KRAS, a membrane-associated
small GTPase and notorious oncogene. Mutations that render KRAS constitutively
active will lead to uncontrolled cell growth and cancer. However,
despite aggressive efforts in recent years, there are no drugs on
the market that directly target KRAS and inhibit its aberrant functions.
In the current work, we combined structure-based design with a battery
of cell and biophysical assays to discover a novel pyrazolopyrimidine-based
allosteric KRAS inhibitor that binds to activated KRAS with sub-micromolar
affinity and disrupts effector binding, thereby inhibiting KRAS signaling
and cancer cell growth. These results show that pyrazolopyrimidine-based
compounds may represent a first-in-class allosteric noncovalent inhibitors
of KRAS. Moreover, by studying two of its analogues, we identified
key chemical features of the compound that interact with a set of
specific residues at the switch regions of KRAS and play critical
roles for its high-affinity binding and unique mode of action, thus
providing a blueprint for future optimization efforts.

Introduction
Somatic mutations in
RAS proteins are associated with about 16%
of all human cancers.1,2 KRAS is the most frequently mutated
RAS isoform, accounting for 85% of all RAS-related cancers.1,2 Cellular KRAS is tethered to the inner surface of the plasma membrane
by a farnesylated polybasic lipid anchor3 and cycles between active guanosine triphosphate (GTP)- and inactive
guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound conformational states.4 GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) facilitate
hydrolysis of GTP by KRAS, whereas guanine nucleotide exchange factors
(GEFs) catalyze GDP dissociation.4−6 Upon activation by receptor
tyrosine kinases such as epidermal growth factor receptors, GEFs are
recruited to KRAS and initiate exchange of GDP for GTP. Active KRAS
interacts with effectors such as Raf in the MAPK pathway and PI3K
in the AKT pathway,7 driving cell growth
and proliferation.8,9 In a regulated RAS cycle, signaling
is turned off upon GTP hydrolysis. Oncogenic mutations that impair
its GAP-mediated or intrinsic GTPase activity render KRAS constitutively
active and thereby cause uncontrolled cell growth/proliferation, leading
to cancer.1,2 Mutant KRAS is therefore a highly sought-after
anticancer drug target.10,11

Despite decades
of efforts, however, drugging KRAS (and RAS proteins
in general) remains an unrealized goal.12 Among the many challenges, conservation of the nucleotide-binding
site among a diverse group of small GTPases4,13 and
the high (picomolar) affinity of RAS for its endogenous ligands, GDP
or GTP, are arguably the most significant. These issues made competitive
inhibition impractical and avoiding off-target effects difficult.
Thus, along with efforts at indirect RAS inhibition by targeting its
interaction partner proteins14,15 or membrane localization,16,17 development of direct allosteric KRAS inhibitors is currently a
major focus of many laboratories.18 Proof-of-principle
studies have established the allosteric nature of RAS11,19,20 and discovered several allosteric
small-molecule KRAS binders.21−25 Moreover, a number of recent reports described molecular fragments,23 small molecules,18,24−26 peptidomimetics,27,28 and monobodies29 that bind KRAS and modulate its functions in various ways.
Although this paints an optimistic picture of the prospects of allosteric
KRAS inhibition, to the best of our knowledge, none of these compounds
has made it to clinical trial. Recent efforts toward developing covalent
GDP analogues30 or other small-molecule
ligands31 targeting G12C mutant KRAS may
have a better chance of eventually treating specific tumor types.18 However, their application is likely limited
to a few cancer cases such as small-cell lung cancer.10 We believe noncovalent allosteric inhibition will be needed
to target some of the most important mutations in KRAS including G12D,
G12V, G13D, and Q61H found in biliary tract, small intestine, colorectal,
lung, and pancreatic cancers.2,10 Together, these four
mutations appear to account for greater than 78% of all KRAS-associated
cancers.10

In previous reports, we
described four allosteric ligand-binding
sites on KRAS using a range of computational approaches,32,33 including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to sample transient
conformations with open allosteric pockets.34−36 Among these,
pocket p1 was the best characterized and is well-established as a
suitable target with many crystal structures of p1-bound ligand–KRAS
complexes available in the protein data bank (PDB). In the current
work, we combined MD simulation with a range of biophysical and cell
assays to discover and characterize a novel class of inhibitors that
bind to the p1 pocket with sub-micromolar affinity and abrogate signaling
primarily by directly inhibiting the interaction of KRAS with effector
proteins.

Materials and Methods
MD Simulation and Allosteric Pocket Analysis
Most oncogenic
RAS mutants are constitutively active because their ability to hydrolyze
GTP is compromised.37,38 An inhibitor that selectively
targets GTP-bound mutant RAS would therefore be desirable. However,
there was no ligand-free high-resolution experimental structure of
GTP-bound KRAS (GTPKRAS) when we started this project in
2014, and our target pocket p1 (see below) was closed or was too small
in the available GDP-bound KRAS (GDPKRAS) structures. Therefore,
we used MD simulation to generate an ensemble of GTPKRAS
structures with open p1. The initial structure for the simulation
was a 5′-guanosinediphosohate-monothiophosphate (GSP)-bound
KRASG12D X-ray structure from the PDB (ID 4DSO) with benzamidine
bound at p1 and glycerol between helices 2 and 3.23 After converting GSP to GTP, removing all other molecules
except crystal waters and the bound Mg2+, adding hydrogen
atoms and solvent, minimization, and restrained simulation, we conducted
a 300 ns production run using a protocol identical to that described
in a recent report.39 The trajectory was
analyzed in terms of volume and other features (such as number of
hydrogen bond donors and acceptors) of our target pocket p1, and the
conformation with the most open p1 was selected for the virtual screening
of ligand libraries.

High-Throughput Virtual Screening
Six million compounds
from the Drugs Now subset of the ZINC40 database were docked into pocket p1 of our MD-derived KRASG12D structure (Figure 1A, see also Figure S1). Gasteiger charges
and atomic radii were assigned using AutoDock tools, and a first round
of docking was conducted with AutoDock,41 as implemented in the parallelization routine DOVIS.42 We used the flexible ligand option with 1.0
Å spacing, along with a Lamarckian search with 150 generations
and 1 000 000 energy evaluations. The top ∼4000
compounds with energy score ≤−6.8 kcal/mol were rescreened
with VINA v1.1.243 with exhaustiveness
set to 12 and energy range set to 4. The top 500 hits in each screen
were then evaluated in terms of their ability to form close contact,
salt bridge, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic, cation−π,
π–π, and π–stacking interactions with
the protein, using distance and angle cutoffs recommended by Durant
and McCammon.44 We found 58 ligands that
score well in the majority of these metrics, procured ∼30 that
were available for purchase, and experimentally tested the 11 compounds listed in Figure S2A using a low-throughput cell signaling
assay.

along with dissociation constants (KD)

50 nM KRAS with increasing concentration of compound are shown: KRASWT (red), KRASG12C (green), KRASG12D (purple),
and KRASQ61H (blue), each bound to the nonhydrolyzable
GTP analogue, guanylyl imidodiphosphate (GNP). No or very weak binding
was detected toward GDP-bound KRAS, GNP- or GDP-bound NRAS and HRAS,
and Rap1B that was used as control (Figure S3).

Cell Signaling
The inhibitory potential of compounds
was tested in monoclonal baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell lines stably
expressing monomeric green fluorescence protein (mGFP)-tagged KRASG12D, KRAS,G12V and HRASG12V. Cells were
cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Hyclone)
supplemented with 10% v/v bovine calf serum and incubated with compound
or vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 3 h without serum. Cells
were then harvested in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 75 mM NaCl,
25 mM NaF, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM egtazic acid (EGTA), 1 mM dithiothreitol,
100 μM NaVO4, and 1% Nonidet P40 plus protease inhibitors]
and subjected to western analysis, controlling protein loading by
bicinchoninic acid assay. Lysates were resolved with Bio-Rad polyacrylamide
TGX 10% gel, transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, and
immunoblotted using pan-AKT (2920S), GFP (2956S), p-AKTS473 (4060L), p-cRafS338 (9427S), p-ERKT202/Y204 (4370L), ERK1/2 (4695S), or β-actin antibodies (Cell Signaling
Technology). IC50 values were calculated with Prism 4-parameter
fit.

Pull-Down
We pulled down GFP–RAS with the GST-tagged
RAS binding domain (RBD) of cRafA85K (hereafter GST–RafRBD) to monitor RAS–Raf interaction. To prepare GST–RafRBD bound to agarose beads, bacteria (BL21) transfected with
a previously cloned GEX plasmid were grown in selection media to optical
density levels of 0.5–1.0 before protein expression was initiated
with isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (1:1000). After 4
h, the sample was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C,
the pellet was resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, PIC 1:50, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride
1:100, and the cells were lysed with cycles of freezing and thawing.
The lysate was sonicated to break up the DNA and pelleted. The supernatant
was incubated with glutathione agarose (Pierce) beads that bind to
GST–RafRBD. For all pull-down experiments, equal
volumes of lysates from BHK cells expressing GFP–RAS were incubated
for 2 h at 4 °C with GST–RBD beads plus control DMSO or
compound. Then, the samples were washed with Tris buffer (50 mM Tris,
pH 7.4, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM EGTA, 150
mM NaCl, 0.1% Trition X-100, and protease inhibitors) and immunoblotted
with anti-GFP (Cell Signaling) and anti-GST (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)
antibodies.

Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging–Fluorescence
Resonance
Energy Transfer
Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM)–Fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments were carried out using
a lifetime fluorescence imaging attachment (Lambert Instruments, The
Netherlands) on an inverted microscope.45 BHK cells transiently expressing mGFP-tagged KRASG12D (donor) alone or with mRFP-tagged cRafWT (acceptor) (1:5
ratio) were prepared and treated with compound for 2 h, washed with
PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and quenched with 50 mM NH4Cl. The samples were excited using a sinusoidally modulated
3 W 470 nm light-emitting diode (LED) at 40 MHz under epi-illumination.
Fluorescein (lifetime = 4 ns) was used as a lifetime reference standard.
Cells were imaged with a Plan APO 60× 1.40 oil objective using
an appropriate GFP filter set. The phase and modulation were determined
from 12 phase settings using the manufacturer’s software. Resolution
of two lifetimes in the frequency domain was performed using a graphical
method46 mathematically identical to global
analysis algorithms.47,48 The analysis yields the mGFP
lifetime of the free mGFP donor (τ1) and the mGFP
lifetime in donor/acceptor complexes (τ2). FLIM data
were averaged on a per-cell basis. In a separate set of experiments,
BHK cells coexpressing GFP–KRASG12D or GFP–HRASG12V with the empty vector pC1 or mCherry-RBD were treated
with vehicle DMSO or 1 μM, and GFP fluorescence was measured
as described above.

Cell Proliferation
Potential effect
of the ligands
on cancer cell proliferation was tested in four lung cancer cells,
SKLU-1 (KRASWT), H1975 (KRASWT), H441 (KRASG12V), and H522 (KRASG12D), and four oral cancer
cell lines, UM-SCC-22A (HRASWT), UM-SCC-22A (HRASG12V), HN31 (HRASG12D), and HN31 (HRASknockdown). One thousand cells were seeded per well in a 96-well plate. After
24 h of seeding, fresh growth medium supplemented with vehicle (DMSO)
or varying concentrations of the drug was added. Cells were treated
with the drug for 72 h, with the addition of fresh medium containing
the drug every 24 h. Then, the cells were washed with PBS and frozen
at −80 °C for a minimum of 24 h. The plates were thawed,
and CyQUANT dye (in lysis buffer provided in the CyQUANT cell proliferation
assay kit, Invitrogen) was added. After 5-minute incubation, fluorescence
(excitation: 480 nm emission: 520 nm) was measured with a Tecan Infinite
M200 plate reader for the lung cancer cells, and the number of oral
cancer cells were quantified using the CyQUANT Proliferation Assay
(ThermoFisher), according to manufacturer’s protocol.

Microscale
Thermophoresis
Determination of dissociation
constants using microscale thermophoresis (MST) was performed following
vendor protocols. Purified RAS was labeled with the Monolith MT Protein
Labeling Kit RED–NHS (NanoTemper Tech) through buffer-exchange
in the labeling buffer [40 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, and 500 mM NaCl]. The concentration of the eluted protein
was adjusted to 2–20 μM, the dye was added at a 2–3-fold
concentration to a final volume of 200 μL, and the mixture was
incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. Labeled KRAS
was purified using the column provided in the kit. For MST measurements,
16-point serial dilution of the ligand was prepared in an MST assay
buffer (40 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM NaCl, plus
0.05% TWEEN-20, and 2–4% DMSO) and added to an equal volume
of 100 nM KRAS solution. The solutions were loaded in capillaries,
and measurements were done at room temperature using 20% LED and 40%
MST power. The data were fit in Igor Pro using the Hill equation.

Nucleotide Exchange and Release Assays
Loading of fluorescent-labeled
GDP (BODIPY–GDP; BGDP from hereon) to KRAS was conducted following
previous reports,23,49 with minor modifications. Purified
KRAS was buffer-exchanged in an NAP-5 column (GE Life Sciences) in
a low Mg2+ buffer (25 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, and 0.5
mM MgCl2). The eluate was incubated with 10-fold molar
excess of BGDP (Life Technologies) in the presence of 5 mM EDTA and
1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) for 1.5 h at 20 °C in the dark. Then,
10 mM MgCl2 was added, and the solution was incubated for
30 min at 20 °C. Free nucleotide was removed by gel filtration
using a PD-10 column (GE Life Sciences) that had been equilibrated
with the reaction buffer (25 mM Tris–HCL, pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl,
1 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM DTT). The concentration of BGDPKRAS was determined using the Bradford assay and a BGDP standard
curve. Then, the effect of ligands on the intrinsic rate of nucleotide
release was monitored using the decrease in fluorescence with time
as BGDP dissociates from KRAS in a 100 μL reaction mixture (96-well
plate) of 0.5 μM BGDPKRAS, 100 μM GTP, and
varying concentrations of the ligand (0–25 μM); GTP was
added just before the measurements. To measure the rate of SOS-mediated
nucleotide release, 0.5 μM SOS (residues 564–1049, Cytoskeleton
Inc) was added after adding GTP, and the fluorescence was immediately
read (excitation: 485 nm, emission: 510 nm) using a Tecan Infinite
M200 plate reader. Intrinsic and SOS-mediated nucleotide exchange
rates were monitored with the fluorescence intensity increase of BGTP
as it displaces GDP from KRAS. We used a 100 μL reaction mixture
containing 0.5 μM each of GDPKRAS and BGTP (and SOS)
plus varying concentrations of the ligand (0–5 μM); BGTP
was added just before the measurements. Experiments were conducted
with minimal light, and the reaction was monitored for 2 h at room
temperature. Fluorescence intensities were normalized at 120 s, and
the traces were fit with linear or single exponential functions (Igor
Pro, Wavemetrics).

Fluorescence Polarization
Fluorescence
polarization
assay was conducted following previous reports.50,51 KRAS was preloaded with the nonhydrolyzable fluorescent GTP analogue
BODIPY-GTP-γ-S (BGTP-γ-S; Life Technologies) using buffer
exchange in NAP-5 (GE Life Sciences), as described in the previous
section. Then, 0.5 μM (50 μL) BGTP-γ-SKRAS was incubated with an equal volume but varying concentrations
(0–2.5 μM) of GST–RafRBD (Raf RBD residues
1–149; Life Technologies) for 30 min in the dark. To determine
the effect of ligand on RAS–Raf binding, KRAS was first incubated
with a fixed concentration of the ligand for 30 min and then with
GST–RafRBD. Fluorescence polarization was measured
using a POLARStar OPTIMA plate reader (excitation: 485 nm, emission:
520 nm) at room temperature. GST-tag was used to increase the weight
of RafRBD for greater polarization. The dissociation constant
for KRAS–Raf binding was determined using a quadratic ligand-binding
equation.50

Results and Discussion
Initial
Hits from Molecular Modeling and High-Throughput Virtual
Screening
We conducted in silico screening of compounds from
the ZINC database,40 targeting pocket p1
on an MD-derived structure of GTPKRASG12D. This
pocket is located between the functionally critical switches 1 (residues
25–40) and 2 (residues 60–75) and encompasses residues
5–7, 37–39, 50–56, 67, and 70–75 (Figures 1A and S1). Many of these residues, including residues
37–39 on the effector binding loop and residue 71 on switch
2, participate in interactions with effectors and/or GEFs. Therefore,
we reasoned that a p1-targeted ligand could disrupt either or both
of these interactions. However, p1 was fully or partially closed in
the available KRAS structures including the holo forms, which were
generally bound to small (<160 Da) ligands (Figure S1). We wanted to have a more open conformation to
dock a wide range of “druglike” molecules spanning the
∼150–500 Da molecular weight range common in marketed
drugs. We therefore conducted MD simulation to generate an ensemble
of GTPKRASG12D structures with open p1. Analysis
of the trajectory yielded 119 and 219 Å3 as the mean
and maximum volumes of pocket p1, respectively. We performed retrospective
comparison of the MD conformer with the most open p1, which we used
for molecular docking, with currently available GTP (or analogue)-
and GDP-bound crystallographic KRAS structures (Figure S1). We observed three distinct groups of conformers
that differ mainly in the orientation of helix 2. In one group, the
orientation of helix 2 is such that pocket p1 is nearly or completely
closed (orange). All of these structures are GDP-bound and are dominated
by structures in complex with covalent ligands. In the second, sampled
by both GDP- and GTP-bound KRAS, movement of helix 2 toward helix
3 opens up the pocket to some extent. In group 3, helix 2 moved even
farther away from the core β-sheet, allowing for a more open
p1. Our MD-derived conformer belongs to the third group and exhibits
the largest displacement of helix 2, which, together with side chain
reorientations, allowed for a wider pocket p1 (Figure S1). We used this snapshot to conduct an initial screen
of 6 000 000 compounds, followed by a secondary screen
of the top ∼4000 (see Methods). Analysis
of the top 500 ligands in each screen yielded a consensus prediction
of 58 initial hits. Eleven of these were purchased and tested in cells
(Figure S2A).

Cell Signaling Assays Identify
Compound 11 as a
Promising Initial Hit
Western analysis was used to quickly
assess the potential impact of our predicted hits on MAPK signaling,
a major pathway mediated by KRAS. Specifically, we monitored ERK1/2
phosphorylation levels (p-ERK) in BHK cells stably expressing KRASG12D treated with vehicle (DMSO), the MEK inhibitor U0125 (U),
or the compound at four different concentrations (1–100 μM).
The results showed that the majority of the predicted hits have no
effect, whereas few (e.g., 4) increase rather than decrease
the p-ERK levels (Figure S2B). Compounds 9 and 11, on the other hand, decreased the p-ERK
levels at concentrations ≥50 and ≥1 μM, respectively.
To verify the latter observation, we repeated the experiments in an
expanded concentration range starting from 0.1 μM. As in the
first screen, compound 11 dose-dependently decreased
the p-ERK levels, leading to a ∼50% reduction at 5 μM
(Figure S2C). However, compound 9 increased the p-ERK levels at 25 and 38 μM in contrast to
the decrease observed at higher concentrations (Figure S2B). Although a similar increase and then decrease
of KRAS signaling upon increasing of ligand concentration has been
observed before,49,52 we selected the more potent and
monotonously dose-dependent compound 11 for further analysis.

Compound 11 Binds to WT and Oncogenic KRAS Mutants
with High Affinity
Figure 1B,C shows the chemical structure and the predicted
complex of compound 11 with KRAS, suggesting that the
ligand potentially forms multiple favorable interactions with residues
in the p1 pocket. Figure 1D shows that the compound binds to the isolated catalytic
domain (residues 1–166) GTPKRASWT with
a KD = ∼0.3 μM, suggesting
a very tight binding rarely seen in primary screens. The compound
has a very similar affinity (KD = ∼0.4–0.7
μM) for oncogenic mutants KRASG12D, KRASG12C, and KRASQ61H in the GTP state (Figure 1D). However, very weak or no binding was
detected for KRASWT and KRASG12D in the GDP
state, HRASWT and NRASWT in both their GDP and
GTP-bound forms, or to our control Rap1b (Figure S3), a RAS-related small GTPase with a homologous structure.
Few weak-affinity noncovalent binders that exhibit some selectivity
toward GDP- or GTP-KRAS have been reported.23−25 Although further
scrutiny is required to establish its true selectivity profile, our
initial observations suggest that compound 11 may represent
the first small molecule to selectively bind GTP-bound KRAS with high
affinity.

In the docked pose (Figure 1C), the 1-piperazineethanol moiety occupies
an electronegative cleft near D54 and D38, potentially donating hydrogen
bonds to the side chain and backbone atoms of E37. The methylated
pyrazolopyrimidine core sits in a trench on top of V7 and L56 with
its methyl group pointing toward I55, whereas the pyrimidine-bound
benzene ring occupies the space between the central β-sheet
(β1−β3) and helix 2 and makes π-stacking
interaction with Y71. The pyrazol-attached benzene is buried deep
in a tight pocket, stabilized primarily by van der Waals interactions
with the side chain carbon atoms of V7, L6, and K5. These interactions
are common in the majority of our predicted hits listed in Figure S2A, and redocking of compound 11 after in silico mutation of each of these residues to Ala reduced
the AutoDock free energy score by up to 2 kcal/mol. Therefore, we
propose that, in addition to potential induced-fit effects, the preference
of compound 11 for GTP-bound KRAS may be due to conformational
differences of these residues in GTPRAS versus GDPRAS.4 Comparison of available GDP- and
GTP-bound RAS structures supports this conclusion. For example, pocket
p1 is partially occluded by helix 2 in a large number of GDP-bound
KRAS (Figure S1) and HRAS (Figure S4) crystallographic structures. Similarly,
the apparent preference of compound 11 for KRAS over
HRAS or NRAS may arise from subtle conformational differences. For
example, Mattos and colleagues have recently shown that the active
site of activated KRAS is more open and dynamic than that of HRAS.53

Compound 11 Disrupts Interaction
of KRAS with Raf
We used three different assays to check
if our compound inhibits
RAS signaling by interfering with effector binding. These included
fluorescence polarization and pull-down assays, which directly measure
the interaction of KRAS with the RBD of Raf in purified or cell lysate
systems, respectively, and FLIM–FRET, which measures the interaction
of KRAS with full-length or truncated Raf in the cellular milieu.
We used fluorescence polarization of BGTP-γ-S to monitor the
binding of the KRAS catalytic domain to GST–RafRBD with and without preincubation with 1 μM compound 11. Figure 2A shows
a dramatic decrease in polarization in the entire concentration range
of GST–RafRBD. For example, at 2 μM GST–RafRBD, compound treatment reduced the polarization and therefore
RAS–RafRBD interaction by >80%. That we observed
such a large reduction despite the weaker affinity of the RBD used
in this assay (residues 1–149) than the commonly used shorter
RBD (residues 51–131) further highlights the major impact of 11 on KRAS/Raf complex formation. The dissociation constant
derived from the polarization curves indicate that 11 reduced the affinity of KRAS to RafRBD by ∼13-fold.
Consistent with this observation, pull-down of GFP–KRASG12D by GST–RafRBD in compound-treated cell
lysates show a significant (e.g., >50% at 1 μM of 11) decrease in GFP–KRASG12D levels (Figure 2B).

Figure 2 Compound 11 disrupts KRAS–Raf interaction.
(A) Fluorescence polarization of BGTP-γ-SKRAS (0.5 μM) as a function of varying concentration of GST–RafRBD in the absence (red) and presence (blue) of 1 μM
compound 11. Shown above the curves is the KD for KRAS–RafRBD binding obtained by
fitting the data to , where P1 is
the polarization
of free KRAS, P2 is the polarization of Raf-bound
KRAS, c is the total concentration of KRAS, and x is the total concentration of RafRBD. (B) Amount
of GFP–KRASG12D pulled down by GST–RafRBD after treatment of cell lysates with compound at the indicated
concentrations (representative westerns shown at the top). An equal
volume of lysates was used, and the data were normalized to GST–RBD
and DMSO control, which also serves as the loading control. The RBD
sequence length was 1–149 and 51–131 in the fluorescence
polarization and pull-down assays, respectively. Whereas the shorter
RBD is sufficient for biochemical assays, the extra amino acids in
the longer RBD increases the size and thereby enhances the signal-to-noise
ratio in the fluorescence polarization assay. (C) GFP fluorescence

cells expressing GFP–KRASG12D or HRASG12V with an empty vector pC1 or mCherry-RafRBD (RBD: residues

error (SE) from three separate experiments; significance was estimated
by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) relative to the control for
each bar in B, second bar in C, and second and fourth bars in D, or
relative to the bar immediately to the left of bar 3 in C and bars
3 and 6 in D.

We observed a similar
effect in FLIM–FRET experiments in
cells. In this experiment, quenching of GFP fluorescence lifetime
indicates RAS–cRaf interaction in cells cotransfected with
GFP–RAS and RFP–cRaf. In cells coexpressing KRASG12D and wild-type full-length cRaf, quenching of GFP fluorescence
lifetime and hence KRASG12D–cRaf interaction is
significantly reduced upon compound treatment (Figure 2C). FLIM–FRET was also used to examine
the interaction of GFP-tagged RAS mutants and mCherry-tagged RafRBD. As shown in Figure 2D, GFP fluorescence lifetime in cells expressing GFP–KRASG12D with empty vector pC1 was ∼2.3 ns, which decreased
to ∼1.93 ns in cells coexpressing GFP–KRASG12D and mCherry–RBD, indicating significant FRET and thus an
interaction between the two constructs. Treatment with 1 μM
compound 11 for 2 h increased the GFP lifetime to ∼2.02
ns, suggesting reduction of the interaction between KRASG12D and RBD. The same experiments with GFP–HRASG12V and mCherry-RBD show that compound 11 has inexplicably
the opposite albeit small effect on the interaction of HRASG12V with RafRBD. These results in cells confirm our observations
from pull-downs in lysates and fluorescence polarization in purified
systems and support the potential KRAS-selectivity of compound 11 suggested by MST.

Compound 11 Inhibits KRAS Signaling
Figure 3 shows that
compound 11 dose-dependently decreases both p-ERK and
p-cRaf levels
in BHK cells expressing KRASG12D and KRASG12V, suggesting inhibition of RAS signaling via the MAPK pathway. The
data also indicate that the ligand has a slightly lower IC50 for its direct effector cRaf (e.g., 0.7 μM in the case of
KRASG12D) than the two-steps removed ERK (1.3 μM).
Note also that the IC50 for cRaf is very close to the KD of the ligand for GTPKRAS. Changes
in phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels show that the compound also inhibits
signaling through the AKT pathway but to a lesser extent than the
MAPK pathway. Together, these results suggest that the ligand disrupts
MAPK signaling by acting on RAS or its upstream modulators. We have
also measured p-ERK and p-cRaf levels in BHK cells expressing the
constitutively active HRASG12V (Figure 3, right). In these cells and the ligand concentration
range that we have tested, compound 11 has less effect
on p-ERK and p-cRaf levels and hence on signaling via the MAPK pathway.
Similarly, no statistically significant effect on p-AKT levels was
observed even though H-Ras is a major driver of the AKT pathway. As
a control, treatment of the HRASG12V-expressing BHK cells
with 10 μM of U (the MEK inhibitor U0126) almost completely
abolished MAPK signaling (Figure 3).

We tested the effect of compound 11 on the proliferation
of four lung and four oral cancer cell lines and found that the KRAS-expressing
lung cancer cells, particularly those with mutant KRAS, are more sensitive
to the compound than the HRAS-expressing oral cancer cells (Figure 4A). Also, there is
no major difference between HRASWT and HRASG12V/HRASG12D cancer cells or between HN31 cancer cells with
and without HRAS knockdown. In Figure 4B, the relative growth of the eight cell lines in the
presence of 5 μM compound 11 is shown. Relative
to DMSO control, growth of the oral cancer cells with or without mutant
HRAS as well as the lung cancer cells with wild-type KRAS is 60–80%,
whereas the corresponding number for the lung cancer cells harboring
KRASG12D or KRASG12V is 30–35%. In summary,
data from the eight cell lines that we have tested suggest that compound 11 more efficiently inhibits signaling through KRAS than HRAS,
consistent with its tight binding to activated KRAS (Figure 1) and effect on KRAS–Raf
interaction (Figure 2) and its weaker binding (if any) to HRAS and NRAS (Figure S3).

mutant KRAS are more sensitive to compound 11. (A) Proliferation

UM-SCC-22A lines harboring HRASWT and HRASG12V, HN31 cells expressing HRASG12D, and HN31 cells with
HRAS knockdown. Data are shown as mean ± SE; significance was
estimated by one-way ANOVA with respect to the data for SKLU-1: *

Proposed Mechanism of Action and
Optimization Route for Pyrazolopyrimidine-Based
Kras Inhibitors.
In addition to its effect on effector binding,
compound 11 also slightly reduced the rates of both intrinsic
and SOS-mediated GDP/GTP exchange reactions of KRAS as well as SOS-mediated
GDP release (Supporting Information text
and Figure S5). To identify the chemical fingerprints of compound 11 potentially responsible for its high-affinity binding and
effect on KRAS function, we studied compounds 12 and 13. Obtained from similarity searches based on 11, these analogues provided valuable insights into the likely mechanism
of action of our pyrazolopyrimidine-based ligand. In compound 12, the 1-piperazineethanol functional group of 11 is replaced by 1-methylpiperazine (Figure 5A,B), making it more hydrophobic and less
soluble in DMSO. This compound slightly reduced the p-ERK levels at
a higher concentration of 2 μM (Figure 5C), but it is nearly as effective as 11 in inhibiting proliferation of lung cancer cells (Figure 5D). However, it has
no effect on p-cRaf levels (Figure 5C) or on KRAS–Raf interaction as assessed by
FLIM–FRET (Figure 5E), suggesting a potentially different mechanism of inhibition
than compound 11 or an off-target effect. The predicted
binding mode of 12 is similar to that of 11, but it lacks the capacity for hydrogen-bonding interactions with
residues at the effector-binding loop (Figure 5B). Together, these results suggest that
the hydroxymethyl group on the piperazine ring, which in compound 11 is predicted to interact with residues in the effector-binding
loop (Figure 1C), plays
a crucial role in disrupting KRAS–Raf interaction and/or in
modulating binding to KRAS.

three independent experiments, and error bars represent SE. (E) GFP

and with or without treatment with 2 μM compound 12.

However, a derivative with a better
solubility profile than 12 and one that preserves the
ability of 11 to
inhibit effector binding would be more desirable. The less hydrophobic
compound 13 (Figure 6A,B), which has a methyl group attached to the pyrimidine
in place of the benzene ring found in 11, is readily
soluble in DMSO and other common solvents. This allowed us to measure
its KD with G12D and other KRAS mutants
using MST. The results summarized in Figure 6C show that compound 13 has
a 6.5–7.1-fold weaker affinity for KRAS than compound 11. Similar to compound 11, however, 13 does not appear to bind to GDPKRASWT or GDPKRASG12D. Comparison of the docked poses of 11 (Figure 1C) and 13 (Figure 6B) suggests a potential rationale for the observed
differences in binding affinity. The benzene ring of compound 11 is involved in a T-shaped π-stacking interaction
with the side chain of Y71, which is replaced by the much smaller
methyl in 13. This suggests a critical role for the phenyl
ring on the pyrimidine core for potency, providing a useful clue for
future optimization efforts.

compound 13. (E) Amount of GFP-KRASG12D pulled
down by GST–RafRBD after treatment of whole cell
lysates with 10 μM compound 13 (representative
western blots shown at the top). An equal volume of lysates was used,
and the data are normalized to GST–RBD and DMSO control. (F)
Intrinsic and SOS-mediated nucleotide release rates in a mixture of
0.5 μM KRAS (and SOS), 100 μM GTP, and 0 or 50 μM
compound 13 (top) derived from changes in the fluorescence
intensity during the reaction KRASBGDP + GTP → KRASGTP + BGDP (bottom). Rates were calculated using single exponential
fits starting at 120 s.

We then used fluorescence polarization and pull-down assays
to
test the functional implication of the modification in 13 relative to the parent compound 11. Figure 6D shows that 20 μM compound 13 disrupts the interaction of KRAS with GST–RafRBD as effectively as the parent compound. Our pull-down assay
led to the same conclusion: 13 disrupts KRASG12D–RafRBD interaction (Figure 6E). These results demonstrate that modifications
can be made on the pyrazolopyrimidine core to optimize for potency
without compromising the effect on effector binding. This conclusion
is supported by the predicted ligand/KRAS complex structures (Figures 1C and 6B), which show that 11 and 13 are
likely to make identical contacts with residues at the effector-binding
region via their piperazine ring and especially the piperazineethanol
group. This is important because, as we have shown using 12, modification in this part of the ligand may cause loss of effect
on Raf binding. We then wondered if interaction with switch 2 residues
or lack thereof may play a role in nucleotide release, because the
conformation of many switch 2 residues, such as Y71 and Y64, differs
between free and GEF-bound RAS.54,55 To test this, we measured
the intrinsic and SOS-dependent rates of labeled-GDP release in the
absence and presence of 13. We found that, indeed, replacing
the benzene ring on the pyrimidine core by methyl dramatically altered
the effect on nucleotide release. Whereas 11 had no effect
on intrinsic and only modestly decreased the rate of SOS-mediated
nucleotide release (Figure S5), 13 dramatically increased both rates (Figure 6F). This result suggests that interaction
with switch 2 residues including Y71 may determine how a p1-bound
ligand affects GEF activity. The results also provide a strong support
for the reliability of the predicted ligand-KRAS complex structures
and offer a viable route for additional modifications in future optimization
efforts.

Concluding Discussion
Finding a
direct inhibitor of KRAS remains a major challenge in
the search for cancer therapy. Previous attempts at preventing membrane
binding of KRAS by farnesyl transferase inhibitors failed in clinical
trials. More recent efforts focused on the dynamics of RAS revealed
allosteric pockets suitable for binding of small molecules.32,35 Several small-molecule ligands that bind to some of these pockets
and disrupt interaction with GEFs or effectors have been discovered.21−25 However, thus far, none of these ligands have led to a viable lead
compound. In the current work, we combined MD simulation to generate
a KRAS conformation with open pocket p1 and virtual screening to identify
potential hits, followed by biophysical and cell biological experiments
for validation. We have discovered a novel high-affinity KRAS inhibitor,
compound 11, that has unique structural features. Compound 11 (2-[4-(8-methyl-3,9-diphenyl-2,6,7-triazabicyclo[4.3.0]nona-2,4,7,9-tetraen-5-yl)piperazin-1-yl]ethanol)
is druglike (drug likeness = 4.1) and somewhat polar with six hydrogen
bond donors and two acceptors (clogP = 0.87). It
has a pyrazolopyrimidine core rather than an indole or imidazole ring
typical in published ligands. Also, 11 is relatively
large (415 Da) with its pyrazol ring methylated and benzylated and
its pyrimidine ring β-modified by benzene and 1-piperazineethanol.
This allowed it to make more extensive predicted contacts with KRAS
p1 residues than is common in most of the published ligands (Figure 1C). Although more
work is required to fully establish its selectivity profile, our data
suggest that compound 11 binds to GTPKRAS
with submicromolar affinity (Figures 1 and S3), inhibits MAPK
signaling (Figure 3), and reduces the growth of cancer cells expressing mutant KRAS
more efficiently than those expressing HRAS (Figure 4). Moreover, we used fluorescence polarization,
pull-down, and FLIM–FRET assays to demonstrate that compound 11 inhibits MAPK signaling primarily by abrogating interaction
with effector proteins (Figure 2), in contrast to many published KRAS ligands that mainly
affect GEF activity.22−24 At a high concentration, 11 exhibits
a small effect on intrinsic and GEF-catalyzed guanine nucleotide exchange
rates (Figure S5), but this effect is too
small at concentrations used in the cell-based assays to explain the
significant inhibitory activity of the compound. For example, there
is a maximum of ∼5% reduction in the rates of both intrinsic
and SOS-mediated nucleotide release or exchange reactions at 1 μM
compound 11. In contrast, the p-ERK levels dropped by
about 50% after a 3 h treatment using the same concentration of the
compound (Figure 3).

The above conclusions are also supported by data from comparative
analyses of compound 11 and its analogues 12 and 13. Compound 13 retains the effect
of the parent compound on Raf binding even though it has a weaker
(low μM) affinity for KRAS. Intriguingly, 13 accelerates
both intrinsic and SOS-mediated rates of nucleotide release, in contrast
to 11 which has no effect on the intrinsic and only modestly
decreases the SOS-mediated reaction rate. Compound 12 has no effect on KRAS/Raf interaction and displays some inhibitory
activities via an unknown mechanism. The distinct behavior of the
derivatives and the parent compound, especially 11 and 13 for which we have data for direct KRAS binding, suggest
altered protein–ligand interactions. We propose that the piperazineethanol
group interacts with switch 1 of KRAS and plays a critical role in
abrogating effector binding, whereas the potentially switch 2-interacting
nonpolar moieties attached to the pyrazolopyrimidine core modulate
GEF activity and contribute to high-affinity binding. These insights
provide ideal starting points for further optimization of our highly
promising lead compounds.
