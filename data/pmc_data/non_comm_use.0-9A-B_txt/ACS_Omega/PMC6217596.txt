The
current study prepared solid dispersions of forchlorfenuron
(CPPU) and γ-cyclodextrin (γCD) or CPPU and 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin
(HPγCD) via cogrinding and coprecipitation to assess their physicochemical
properties and their effect on plant growth. According to phase solubility
diagrams, both CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD formed an inclusion
complex at a molar ratio of 1/1. According to differential scanning
calorimetry and powder X-ray diffraction, a ground mixture (GM) of
CPPU and γCD (molar ratio = 1/1), a GM of CPPU and HPγCD
(molar ratio = 1/1), and a coprecipitate (CP) of CPPU and γCD
(molar ratio = 1/1) formed an inclusion complex. According to 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy
NMR spectroscopy of the GMs and CP, the aromatic rings of the CPPU
molecule are presumably included in CD from the wider to the narrower
rim of its ring. Cultivation of broccoli sprouts with the GMs and
CP resulted in no differences in the length of sprouts in comparison
to a commercial preparation (Fulmet).

==== Body
1 Introduction
Ingredients of agricultural
chemicals that promote plant growth
and development do so by promoting longer stems, promoting flowering,
preventing fruits from dropping, and producing parthenocarpic fruits.
Plant growth and development agents can artificially control the growth
and development of agricultural crops, and they can be used to improve
quality and reduce yield or reduce fruiting. Forchlorfenuron (CPPU)
in particular is known to be a compound that promotes lateral growth
and fruit enlargement (Figure 1A).1 CPPU, a phenylurea synthetic
plant hormone, acts in trace amounts on agricultural crops; CPPU leaves
little residue and has little effect on animals and the environment.2 CPPU is used to enlarge grapefruits, which it
accomplishes by promoting cell division, further extending the period
of cell division and increasing the total number of cells.3 Commercially available preparations containing
CPPU are dissolved using organic solvents and surfactants, and flammability
and toxicity are a concern. Because CPPU is packaged in a glass bottle,
a simple method of preparation is required because of the difficulty
of handling during distribution or after use, and CPPU has to be diluted
when used. If a naturally tolerated CPPU could be developed without
the need for an organic solvent, it could be easily distributed. Moreover,
convenience would be increased if CPPU were dissolved at the time
of use. However, CPPU is poorly soluble in water (solubility: 0.11
mg/mL, 25 °C), so it would need pharmaceutical functionality
to easily dissolve in water.

Figure 1 Chemical structures: (A) CPPU and (B) γCD
and HPγCD.

Cyclodextrin (CD) has
a cyclic structure containing d-glucopyranose
units linked by α (1 → 4) glycosidic bonds, and CD is
classified as αCD, βCD, or γCD based on the number
of glucopyranose units it contains (Figure 1B).

Facilitating the formation of inclusion
complexes with various
drug molecules can improve drug solubility and stability. CDs form
inclusion complexes via hydrophobic interactions.4 Piperine, the pungent component of black pepper, is unstable
to light and poorly water-soluble, but its stability to light can
be improved by its inclusion in γCD.5 Voriconazole, an antifungal drug, is an oral preparation because
of its poor solubility in water. Patients who have difficulty taking
medication orally need to receive injections, and a study has found
that inclusion complexes with CD improve the solubility of itraconazole,
leading to the development of injections.6 CD inclusion complexes are prepared using a variety of techniques,
including coprecipitation,7 kneading,8 freeze-drying,9 and
cogrinding.10 A study has reported that
coprecipitation causes caffeic acid (CA) and γCD to form inclusion
complexes, thus improving the dissolution of CA.11 A solid dispersion of a cyclic polysaccharide and CD could
be prepared. If CPPU could be encouraged to form an inclusion complex
with CD, then the solubility of CPPU would improve, resulting in enhanced
functionality. A study reported that CPPU forms a polymer with βCD.12 However, γCD and γCD derivatives
have a cavity with a larger diameter than that of βCD, and formation
of CPPU and γCD complexes has not been reported. In addition,
no study has evaluated how complex formation by CPPU and CD affects
the solubility of CPPU. Therefore, the current study prepared inclusion
complexes of CPPU and γCD or 2-hydroxypropyl-γ-CD (HPγCD)
to assess their physicochemical properties, molecular interaction,
solubility, and promotion of plant growth.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Phase Solubility Studies
Solubility
testing was performed to determine the molar ratio of CPPU and CD
in inclusion complexes and to determine their stability constants
in an aqueous solution. The results indicated that the solubility
of CPPU increased linearly with γCD and HPγCD, producing
a BI and an AL type of phase solubility diagram
as described by Higuchi et al (Figure 2).29 The stability constant
(Ks) for HPγCD was 154.5 M–1. The complexation efficiency (CE) for HPγCD was 0.0201. γCD
produced a type BI phase solubility diagram, and Ks and CE could not be calculated. An AL type of diagram typically indicates that a complex is formed at
a molar ratio of 1/1, so HPγCD forms a complex at a molar ratio
of 1/1 in solution.

expressed
as the mean ± SD (n = 3).

2.2 1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Analysis
The results of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder
X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns suggest molecular interactions in
both the ground mixture (GM) and coprecipitate (CP). 1H
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy was performed to investigate
the molar ratio of inclusion in the CP. 1H NMR spectra
of CPPU, γCD, and CP are shown in Figure 3. In CPPU, two signals due to NH group hydrogens
were evident at around 8.93–9.31 ppm. In γCD, signals
due to hydrogen and hydroxyl groups of the glucose unit were evident.
In CP, signals due to CPPU and γCD were, respectively, confirmed.
A signal due to the NH group hydrogen of CPPU was evident at around
8.93–9.31 ppm, and this signal was produced by 1 proton, so
there was 0.15 of a proton per hydrogen atom of CPPU in the CP. The
signal due to hydrogen number 1 in the glucose unit of γCD was
produced by 1 proton, so there was 0.125 of a proton per hydrogen
atom of γCD. When the molar ratio of inclusion of the CP was
calculated using the formula, the molar ratio of inclusion complex
formation by γCD and CPPU was 1/1 when there was 0.15 of a CPPU
molecule per 1 molecule of γCD.13

γCD, and (C) CP of CPPU and γCD.

2.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
According to phase solubility diagrams, both CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD
apparently form a complex at a molar ratio of 1/1 in an aqueous solution.
A study by Shiozawa et al. reported that CA forms inclusion complexes
with CD as a result of cogrinding or coprecipitation.14 When a guest molecule ceases to melt or its peak shifts
as a result of inclusion complex formation, changes in its thermal
behavior become evident.15 Accordingly,
the current study performed DSC to examine the thermal behavior of
the sample prepared by cogrinding or coprecipitation. In DSC, intact
CPPU produced an endothermic peak because of melting at 175 °C
(Figure 4A). A physical
mixture (PM) of CPPU and γCD (1/1) and a PM of CPPU and HPγCD
(1/1) had an endothermic peak because of the melting of CPPU at 175
°C, so CPPU crystals were presumably present (Figure 4D,E). Interestingly, the endothermic
peak due to CPPU was not evident in the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1),
the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), or the CP of CPPU and γCD
(Figure 4F–H).
When a drug is included in CD, an endothermic peak produced by melting
of that drug disappears.16 This suggests
that CPPU, γCD, and HPγCD molecules formed inclusion complexes,
causing the endothermic peak due to CPPU to disappear.

and HPγCD (1/1), (F) GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), (G) GM
of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), and (H) CP of CPPU and γCD (1/1).

2.4 Powder
X-ray Diffraction
The results
of DSC suggested that the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of
CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), and the CP of CPPU and γCD formed
an inclusion complex. Thus, the crystalline state of the GMs and CP
was examined using PXRD. Intact CPPU produced diffraction peaks because
of CPPU at 2θ = 23.9° and 27.4°, and γCD produced
a diffraction peak because of γCD at 2θ = 11.9° (Figure 5A,B). In contrast,
HPγCD alone produced a halo pattern (Figure 4C). In addition, ground CPPU did not produce
a halo pattern (not shown data). A PM of CPPU and γCD (1/1)
and a PM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) produced diffraction peaks
because of CPPU at 2θ = 23.9° and 27.4° and a diffraction
peak because of γCD at 2θ = 11.9° (Figure 5D,E). In contrast, a GM of
CPPU and γCD (molar ratio = 1/1) and a GM of CPPU and HPγCD
(molar ratio = 1/1) produced no peaks but they did produce a halo
pattern (Figure 5F,G).
Cogrinding disrupts the structures of crystals, and the amorphous
structure that results can produce a halo pattern in PXRD.17 According to a previous study, supplying mechanical
energy can facilitate the formation of amorphous inclusion complexes.18 Diffraction peaks due to CPPU and due to γCD
disappeared with the CP of CPPU and γCD, and new diffraction
peaks appeared at 2θ = 7.4° and 16.1° (Figure 5H). However, new peaks (2θ
= 7.5°, 12.0°, and 16.5°) are produced, and presumably,
these peaks are specific to inclusion complexes of γCD and a
guest molecule.19 This suggests that the
GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1),
and the CP of CPPU and γCD all formed inclusion complexes.

2.5 Near
Infrared Absorption Spectrometry
PXRD patterns and results
of DSC suggested that inclusion complexes
are formed by the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and
HPγCD (1/1), and the CP of CPPU and γCD (1/1). Near infrared
(NIR) absorption spectrometry was performed to investigate molecular
interaction in detail. In NIR spectra, a peak due to the −OH
groups of CD is produced at around 6660–7140 cm–1.20 A peak due to the −CH groups
of CD is produced at around 8800 cm–1.21 Peaks due to the −NH groups are produced
at around 6800 and 9000 cm–1.

NIR spectra
revealed that CPPU alone produced a peak because of its −CH
groups at around 8800 cm–1 and a peak at around
9000 cm–1 because of its −NH groups. γCD
alone produced a peak because of its −OH groups at around 7000
cm–1 (Figure 6). Second-derivative spectra revealed that the GM of CPPU
and γCD (1/1) produced a shift in the peak because of the −CH
groups of CPPU at around 8800 cm–1 and it produced
a shift in the peak because of the −NH groups of CPPU at around
9000 cm–1 (Figure 6A,B). In addition, the peak due to the −NH groups
of CPPU produced at around 6800 cm–1 and the peak
due to the −OH groups of γCD produced at around 7000
cm–1 broadened (Figure 6C,D). A study has reported that broadening
or shifting of a peak in an NIR spectrum is caused by molecular interaction
of the functional groups of drugs.22 Accordingly,
molecular interaction presumably occurred between the −CH groups
and −NH groups of CPPU and between the −OH groups of
γCD in the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1) and the CP of CPPU
and γCD.

(B) alkyl
group, (C) hydroxy group, and (D) amino group.

HPγCD alone produced a peak because of its −OH
groups
at around 7000 cm–1. According to the second-derivative
spectra, the peak due to the −CH groups of CPPU produced at
around 8800 cm–1 broadened and the peak due to the
−NH groups of CPPU produced at around 9000 cm–1 shifted for the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) (Figure 7A,B). Moreover, the peak due
to the −NH groups of CPPU produced at around 6800 cm–1 and the peak due to the −OH groups of HPγCD produced
at around 7000 cm–1 broadened (Figure 7C,D). These findings presumably
indicate that there is molecular interaction between the −CH
groups and −NH groups of CPPU and the −OH groups of
HPγCD in the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) as well.

2.6 Scanning Electron Microscopy Imaging
Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was performed to observe
the surface and morphology of each sample (Figure 8). The surface of CPPU was smooth, and the
particle size of CPPU was around 200 μm. The surface of γCD
was smooth, and irregularly shaped particles were evident. The particle
size was around 75 μm. Smooth spherical particles were evident
on the surface of HPγCD. The size of the particles was around
40 μm. In the PM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), CPPU and γCD
particles were evident. In the PM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), particles
of CPPU and HPγCD were evident. In the GM of CPPU and γCD
(1/1), the particle surface was coarse, agglomerated particles of
small fragments were evident, and many particles 150 μm or smaller
in size were evident. In the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), fine
particles of 5 μm or less aggregated, and a rough surface was
evident. Cubic grains in which fine particles aggregated were evident
in the CP of CPPU and γCD. According to a previous study, such
findings are due to the formation of an inclusion complex.23 The current findings suggest that cogrinding
and coprecipitation resulted in the formation of an inclusion complex
and that this influenced the particle diameter and particle surface.

2.7 Measurement
of 1H–1H NOESY NMR Spectra
Spatial
interactions between a guest
molecule and the CD cavity can be ascertained with 1H–1H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) NMR spectroscopy,
so the positioning of the guest molecule within the inclusion complex
was predicted using 1H–1H NOESY NMR spectroscopy.24 In the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the H-3
proton (3.85 ppm), H-5 proton (3.83 ppm), and H-6 proton (3.83 ppm)
in the CD cavity and the H-b proton (7.37 ppm) and H-c proton (7.42
ppm) in the aromatic ring of CPPU produced cross peaks (Figure 9A). The H-3 proton is typically
located in the wider rim of the ring of CD, and the H-6 proton is
typically located in the narrower rim of that ring.25 Cross peaks indicate that protons are less than 4 Å
apart, and a more intense peak indicates that protons are closer together.26 In the CP of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the H-3
proton (3.85 ppm), H-5 proton (3.83 ppm), and H-6 proton (3.83 ppm)
in the CD cavity and the H-b proton (7.37 ppm) and H-c proton (7.42
ppm) in the aromatic ring of CPPU similarly produced cross peaks (Figure 9B). In the GM of
CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), the H-3 proton (3.77 ppm), H-5 proton
(3.55 ppm), and H-6 proton (3.59, 3.65 ppm) in the CD cavity and the
H-b proton (7.08 ppm) and H-c proton (7.14, 7.08 ppm) in the aromatic
ring of CPPU produced cross peaks (Figure 10). Intense cross peaks were particularly
produced by the H-b and H-c protons of the aromatic ring of CPPU and
the H-6 proton in the cavity of HPγCD. Thus, the aromatic ring
of the CPPU molecule appears to be oriented from the wider to the
narrower rim of the ring of γCD and HPγCD (Scheme 1).

a CPPU/CD Complex
2.8 Dissolution Profile
Results thus
far suggested that an inclusion complex is formed in a solid state.
Accordingly, a dissolution test was performed to ascertain whether
the formation of CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD inclusion complexes
resulted in changes in the dissolution of CPPU. The samples used in
the test were intact CPPU, the PM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the
PM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1),
the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), and the CP of CPPU and γCD
(1/1) (Figure 11).
The results indicated that the rate of dissolution of intact CPPU
was 2.6% 5 min after the start of the test. The rate of dissolution
for the PM of CPPU and γCD (1/1) was 2.6% and that for the PM
of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) was 8.3%. In CPPU alone, the PM of CPPU
and γCD (1/1), and the PM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), the
dissolution rate gradually increased after 5 min and was about 20%
at 120 min. The rate of dissolution of CPPU 5 min after the start
of the test was 48.2% for the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), 39.5%
for the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), and 77.3% for the CP of
CPPU and γCD. In contrast, the dissolution rate increased after
30 min for the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and
HPγCD (1/1), and the CP of CPPU and γCD. The rate of dissolution
of CPPU after 120 min was approximately 80% for the GM of CPPU and
γCD (1/1), approximately 98% for the GM of CPPU and HPγCD
(1/1), and approximately 97% for the CP of CPPU and γCD. In
the initial 5 min, the dissolution rate of CPPU in the GM of CPPU
and γCD (1/1) and the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) was lower
than that in the CP of CPPU and γCD. This suggests that the
difference in the crystallinity of the composite due to the difference
in the method of preparation affects the wettability of the powder
and is reflected in its dissolution properties. In addition, the GM
of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1) had the highest dissolution rate of
CPPU at 120 min. On the basis of solubility phase diagrams, the concentration
of dissolved CPPU was linear and depended on the amount of HPγCD
added. The CE was 0.0201. Because CE and guest molecules are generally
correlated, the CE for the CPPU/HPγCD system could presumably
be calculated CE and would indicate a high level of dissolution.

Figure 11 Dissolution
profiles of CPPU/CD systems. The results are expressed
as the mean ± SD (n = 3).

Dissolution of CPPU in the GMs and CP improved in comparison
to
that of intact CPPU and the PM. According to previous studies, a solid
dispersion of a drug and CD can display an increased rate of dissolution
via two mechanisms: disruption of the arrangement of molecules of
a drug as a result of it becoming amorphous and the formation of an
inclusion complex.27,28 PXRD patterns revealed that CPPU
and γCD in the GM and CPPU and HPγCD in the GM became
amorphous and formed an inclusion complex. The aromatic rings of CPPU
are hydrophobic, and the NIR spectra revealed molecular interaction
between CPPU and CD. Moreover, the NMR spectra revealed that CPPU
is included in the cavity of γCD or HPγCD in solution,
so the improved dissolution of CPPU is the result of multiple factors
(e.g., CPPU becoming amorphous and its formation of an inclusion complex).
Nevertheless, solubility after 5 min differed as a result of differences
in the method of preparation and the type of CD. This is presumably
due to differences in molecular interaction in the solid dispersion
during PXRD, DSC, and NIR spectroscopy. The above findings suggest
that preparing a solid dispersion by cogrinding or coprecipitating
CPPU and γCD or HPγCD can help to improve the solubility
of CPPU. A CP could not be prepared with HPγCD, so this issue
is a topic for future study.

2.9 Experimental Cultivation
of Broccoli Sprouts
To determine the extent to which CPPU
promoted plant growth as
a result of the formation of CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD inclusion
complexes, broccoli sprouts were cultivated using intact CPPU, intact
γCD, intact HPγCD, the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1),
the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), the CP of CPPU and γCD,
and a commercial preparation of CPPU (Fulmet). Sprouts in the control
group were cultivated using distilled water. The sprout length did
not differ between the control group and intact CPPU, γCD, and
HPγCD (Figure 12A). The GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and HPγCD
(1/1), and the CP of CPPU and γCD resulted in growth equivalent
to that produced by Fulmet, although that growth was inferior to the
growth produced by the control group. The sprout weight did not differ
between the control group and intact CPPU, γCD, and HPγCD
(Figure 12B). The
GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1),
and the CP of CPPU and γCD resulted in growth equivalent to
that produced by Fulmet. The sprout thickness did not differ between
the control group and intact CPPU, γCD, and HPγCD (Figure 12C). The GM of CPPU
and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and HPγCD (1/1), and the
CP of CPPU and γCD resulted in growth equivalent to that produced
by Fulmet. A texture test of sprout thickness was performed on day
5 of cultivation, and hardness was calculated based on texture profile
analysis (Figure 13). The results revealed no differences among the control group, intact
CPPU, intact γCD, and intact HPγCD (no significant differences).
Fulmet and the GM of CPPU and γCD (1/1), the GM of CPPU and
HPγCD (1/1), and the CP of CPPU/γCD resulted in sprouts
with equivalent hardness. Those sprouts had about 3 times the hardness
of sprouts produced by the control group (significant difference; p 0.01) (Figure 14). These findings suggest that CPPU formed inclusion complexes
with γCD and HPγCD, thus improving the solubility of CPPU.
Nonetheless, the action of CPPU to promote cell division was equivalent
to the action of Fulmet.

Figure 14 Image of each sample on day 5.

The commercial preparation (Fulmet) requires complicated
preparation
because it is in a liquid state. However, inclusion complexes were
used to produce preparations in the current study. CPPU in Fulmet
has increased water solubility because it has been dissolved in alcohol.
Thus, this solution of CPPU in alcohol was assumed to result in greater
plant growth effect than CPPU alone. However, preparations containing
CPPU/CD complexes resulted in plant growth equivalent to that of Fulmet.
Therefore, the solubility of CPPU is presumably one of the factors
accounting for the fact that preparations containing CPPU/CD complexes
resulted in greater plant growth than CPPU alone. These preparations
are readily soluble in water and they do not require an organic solvent
or surfactant as is found in commercial preparations (like Fulmet).
In this study, inclusion of CPPU in CD improved the solubility of
CPPU. Fulmet is a solution containing CPPU dissolved in alcohol, but
use of CPPU/CD complexes allows commercial production of CPPU in a
solid state. This would presumably reduce the burden of distribution.
Moreover, use of CPPU/CD complexes allows CPPU to be highly active
at a low concentration, so CPPU can be incorporated in commercial
preparations at a low cost. Thus, new preparations can be developed
for the benefit of farmers.

3 Conclusions
Phase solubility diagrams revealed that CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD
formed an inclusion complex at a molar ratio of 1/1. The results of
DSC, PXRD patterns, NIR spectra, and the results of a dissolution
test of a GM and CP of CPPU and γCD or HPγCD revealed
that CPPU and HPγCD formed inclusion complexes at a molar ratio
of 1/1. The rate of dissolution of CPPU improved as a result of complex
formation (CPPU/γCD and CPPU/HPγCD). In addition, the
GM of CPPU and γCD, the GM of CPPU and HPγCD, and the
CP of CPPU and γCD resulted in plant growth comparable to that
as a result of a commercial CPPU preparation. The use of CPPU as a
promoter of plant growth would presumably increase as a result of
improving the solubility of complexes in the GM of CPPU and γCD,
the GM of CPPU and HPγCD, and the CP of CPPU and γCD.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
4.1.1 Chemicals
CPPU was a bulk powder
purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries Co., Ltd. (Osaka, Japan).
γCD was donated by Cyclo Chem Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan) and was
used after storage at a temperature of 40 °C and a relative humidity
of 82% for 7 days. HPγCD was a bulk powder purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
Co., Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan). HPγCD was used with a molar substitution
of 0.6. Fulmet, which is a commercial preparation of CPPU, was from
Kyowa Hakko Bio Co., Ltd. (Tokyo). All other chemicals and solvents
were of analytical grade and were purchased from Wako Pure Chemical
Industries Co., Ltd.

4.1.2 Preparation of PM and
Ground Mixtures
Each PM was prepared by weighing CPPU and
CD to a molar ratio 1/1
and mixing the two with a vortex mixer for 1 min. Each GM was prepared
by placing a PM (1 g) in an aluminum pan and grinding the mixture
for 60 min using a vibrating rod mill (TI-500ET, CMT Co., Fukushima,
Japan).

4.1.3 Preparation of a CP
A CP was prepared
by dropwise addition of 0.07 mol/mL γCD solution to 0.2 mol/mL
CPPU in acetone. The solution was stirred for 24 h at room temperature
and then allowed to stand at room temperature for 24 h. The sample
was filtered with a filter paper. The precipitate was washed with
3 mL of acetone and dried at room temperature for 24 h. In addition,
attempts were made to prepare a CP using HPγCD, but those attempts
were unsuccessful.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Phase Solubility Studies
Phase
solubility studies were performed according to the method reported
by Higuchi and Connors.29 A supersaturated
amount of CPPU (30 mg) was added to an aqueous solution (10 mL) of
γCD (0–10 mM) or HPγCD (0–15 mM), and the
mixture was shaken at 25 ± 0.5 °C and 200 rpm for 48 h to
obtain a suspension. The suspension was filtered through a 0.45 μm
membrane filter. Quantitation of CPPU was performed with high-performance
liquid chromatography (LC-20A, Shimadzu Co., Ltd, Kyoto) using an
Inertsil ODS-3 packed column (φ5 μm, 4.6 mm × 150
mm, GL Sciences, Tokyo). The samples were measured at a wavelength
of 263 nm. The sample injection volume was 30 μL and the column
temperature was 40 °C. A mobile phase of distilled water/acetonitrile
(1/1) was used, and the CPPU retention time was 5 min at a flow rate
of 1 mL/min. The apparent stability constant (Ks) of a CPPU/CD inclusion complex was calculated using eq 1 from the slope of the
phase solubility diagram and the solubility (S0) of CPPU in the absence of CD. In addition, the CEs of CPPU
and CD were calculated using eq 2. 1   2  

4.2.2 Measurement of 1H NMR Spectra
NMR spectra were obtained using a Varian NMR System 400 MHz (Agilent
Technologies, Tokyo). Dimethyl sulfoxide-d6 was used as a solvent, and the measurement was performed with a
pulse width of 90°, a delay time of 6.4 μs, a scan time
of 3.723 s, and 128 integration steps at 26 °C.

4.2.3 Differential Scanning Calorimetry
A differential scanning
calorimeter (Thermo plus EVO, Rigaku, Tokyo)
was used. All samples were weighed (2 mg) and heated at a scanning
rate of 5.0 °C/min with a nitrogen flow rate of 60 mL/min. Aluminum
pans and lids were used for all samples.

4.2.4 Powder
X-ray Diffraction
PXRD was
performed using an X-ray diffractometer (MiniFlex II, Rigaku) with
Cu radiation, a scan range of 2θ = 5–40°, and a
scan rate of 4°/min. The intensities of diffraction were measured
with a NaI scintillation counter coupled to a discriminator.

4.2.5 NIR Absorption Spectrometry
Each
sample was scanned with a Fourier-transform NIR spectrometer (Büchi
N-500: Nippon Büchi, Tokyo) with a measurement wavelength of
10 000–4000 cm–1, a measuring time
of 8 s, a measuring temperature of 25 °C, and a cell with a 1
nm optical path length.

4.2.6 SEM Imaging
The SEM images were
obtained with a scanning electron microscope (S3000N, Hitachi High-Technologies
Corporation, Tokyo) at an acceleration voltage of 10 kV. The samples
were mounted on aluminum stubs that were then coated with a thin layer
of gold for 70 s to make them electrically conductive.

4.2.7 1H–1H NOESY
NMR Spectroscopy
Two-dimensional NOESY NMR spectroscopy and
selective one-dimensional NMR spectroscopy were performed using a
NMR spectrometer (Varian NMR System 700NB, Agilent) with a cold probe
operating at 699.6 MHz. D2O/CD3OD (1/1) was
used as a solvent. The measurement conditions were as follows: a pulse
width of 90°, a relaxation time of 500 ms, a scanning time of
0.500 s, a fixed delay of 1.500 s, and a temperature of 25 °C.

4.2.8 Dissolution Profile
The dissolution
profile of samples was determined using a dissolution apparatus (NTR
593, Toyama Sangyo) with 900 mL (37 7 0.5 °C) of distilled water
that was stirred at 50 rpm using the paddle method described in the
Seventeen Edition of the Japanese Pharmacopoeia. CPPU was weighed
accurately to 30 mg and placed in the paddle. Dissolution sample (10
mL) was collected at 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 min through a
0.45 μm membrane filter. Quantitation was performed in the same
manner as in the phase solubility studies.

4.2.9 Experimental
Cultivation of Broccoli Sprouts
To evaluate the equivalence
of the promotion of plant growth by
CPPU, cultivation experiments were conducted using a broccoli sprout
cultivation kit (Greenfield Project Co., Ltd., Kumamoto). Five hundred
seeds were planted in pots and the seedlings were placed in a dark
place with a temperature of 25 °C and a humidity of 50%. The
length, weight, and thickness of broccoli sprouts were measured every
2 d. On the fifth day, the texture of the plant was evaluated using
a texture tester (Nippon Measurement System Co., Ltd., Nara). Measurement
was performed at a test speed of 120 mm/min, an upper load limit of
100.00 N, and a rupture detection of 25%; measurements were made continuously.

4.2.10 Statistical Analysis
Data are
expressed as the mean ± standard deviation (SD). The groups were
compared using one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey’s
test for multiple comparison. p < 0.01 was considered
statistically significant.
