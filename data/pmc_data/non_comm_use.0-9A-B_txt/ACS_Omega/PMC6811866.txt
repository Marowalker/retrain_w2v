Multi-metallic alloy nanoparticles
(NPs) can offer tunable or modifiable
localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) properties depending upon
their configurational and elemental alterations, which can be utilized
in various applications, that is, in photon energy harvesting, optical
sensing, biomedical imaging, photocatalysis, and spectroscopy. In
this work, a systematic investigation on the morphological and LSPR
properties of multi-metallic alloy NPs incorporating Ag, Au, Pd, and
Pt is presented on c-plane sapphire (0001). The resulting
NPs exhibit much enhanced and tunable LSPR bands in the UV–VIS
wavelength as compared to the previously reported mono-metallic NPs
based on the considerable improvement in size and shape of nanostructures
along with the electronic heterogeneity. Solid-state dewetting of
sputtered bilayers (Ag/Pt), tri-layers (Ag/Au/Pt), and quad-layers
(Ag/Au/Pd/Pt) is employed to demonstrate a wide variety of configurations,
sizes, densities, and elemental compositions of Pt, AgPt, AuPt, AgAuPt,
AgAuPt, and AgAuPdPt NPs by the systematic control of annealing temperature
and deposition schemes. The distinct morphology and elemental composition
of surface nanostructures are obtained by means of surface diffusion,
intermixing, and surface/interface energy minimization along with
the applied thermal energy. In addition, the sublimation of Ag atoms
from the alloy nanostructure matrix significantly influences the structural,
elemental, and thus optical properties of NPs by reducing the average
size and Ag percentage in the alloy NPs. Based on the specific size,
shape, and elemental composition of NPs, the excitation of LSPR is
correlated to the dipolar, quadrupolar, multi-polar, and higher order
(HO) modes along with the finite difference time domain simulation
of local electric-field. The LSPR intensity is generally stronger
with a higher percentage of Ag atoms in the alloy NPs and gradually
diminished by the sublimation loss. However, even the mono-metallic
and alloy NPs without Ag exhibited significantly improved and dynamic
nature of plasmonic bands in the UV and VIS wavelength.

1 Introduction
Metallic
nanostructures can exhibit the localized surface plasmon
resonance (LSPR) through the coherent electron oscillations induced
by the photon incidence, which can lead to the strong light absorption,
scattering, hot carrier generation, and so forth, at the surface of
NPs.1−4 In recent years, the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) have been extensively exploited for
the development of advanced device applications in various fields
such as energy conversion,5 electronics,6 photonics,7 sensors,8 biomedical,9 and optical
spectroscopy.10 As just one example, the
plasmon-induced strong light scattering by Ag NPs embedded in the
back reflector significantly improve the light trapping in a silicon
solar cell.11 The LSPR properties can be
tuned by controlling the structure, shape, and density of metallic
NPs, which enables the efficient control of optical field enhancement
or concentration in the desired wavelength regions.12−14

In addition,
the combination of various metallic components in
a single NP, namely multi-metallic alloy NP, can offer additional
opportunities to tune the LSPR properties by the control of elemental
composition along with their structural parameters.15−17 Multi-metallic
alloy NPs can offer superior components because of their multi-functionality,
wide tunability, and multiple plasmon bands arisen from the synergy
of the elements utilized.18 To date, various
noble mono-metallic NPs (Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt) have been synthesized
and pursued for various plasmonic applications such as energy harvesting,
water purification, sensing and detection, high-density data storage,
and ultrasensitive spectroscopy.1,11,19,20 However, the detailed investigation
on the fabrication of multi-metallic alloy NPs having various elements
in a single NP geometry has not been demonstrated up to now, which
could provide a general framework for understanding the nanoscale
surface morphology, growth characteristics, optical behaviors, and
perspectives on the potential applications.

In this work, the
detailed study and characterizations on the surface
morphology and optical behavior of various mono-, bi-, tri-, and quad-metallic
alloy NPs on sapphire (0001) are presented. The sputter-deposited
Ag/Pt bilayers, Ag/Au/Pt tri-layers, and Ag/Au/Pd/Pt quad-layers are
systematically annealed to induce the solid-state dewetting that yields
nanostructures of various sizes, densities, configurations, and elemental
compositions; the atomic diffusion, interdiffusion, alloying, nucleation,
and energy minimization induce the growth of nanostructures, as illustrated
in Figure 1. The optical
properties of as-fabricated alloy NPs are assessed by UV–VIS–NIR
spectra that show strong LSPR bands in the visible region and discussed
in terms of various LSPR bands, that is, the dipolar (DR), quadrupolar
(QR), multi-polar (MR), and higher order (HO) peaks, peak shift, and
absorption band evolution. In addition, Ag atom sublimation significantly
affects the surface morphology evolution as well as the LSPR properties
of alloy nanostructures at above 650 °C, and the dynamic behaviors
of LSPR bands such as intensity, position, and bandwidth are exploited
based on the structure and elemental compositions of the alloy NPs.

2 Experimental Section
In this work, both-side polished
430 μm-thick c-plane sapphire (0001) was adapted
as a substrate for the fabrication
of various multi-metallic alloy NPs. Initially, a large piece of sapphire
wafer was diced (0.6 × 0.6 mm2) using a mechanical
saw. Then, the substrates were degassed in a pulsed laser deposition
(PLD) chamber at 600 °C for 30 min under 1 × 10–4 Torr. After degassing, the substrates were ready for the deposition
by the removal of trapped gaseous surface particulates and contaminants.
Basic morphological and optical characterizations confirmed that the
degassed sapphire had a smooth surface and was much cleaner, as shown
in Figure S1a–c. Subsequently, various
bi-, tri-, and quad-layers of Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt films were deposited
on the cleaned sapphire (0001) substrates by using plasma-assisted
sputtering, as shown in Figure 1a.

To fabricate various metallic alloy nanostructures,
three different
deposition schemes were adapted, as shown in Figure 1a, and the deposition sequence was chosen
based on the diffusivity of the metal atoms such that the diffusivity
decreases from the bottom to the top layer. The deposited sample was
placed on a holder with an Inconel blank on backside and transferred
to the PLD chamber for the nanostructure growth by annealing. Prior
to the annealing, the chamber pressure was reduced below 1 ×
10–4 Torr. The samples were annealed systematically
at various target temperatures between 500 and 900 °C. The temperature
was ramped at 4 °C/s and kept constant for 120 s at each target
temperature. The annealing process was controlled by a computer program
to maintain the consistency among samples. After reaching the final
growth condition, the heating system was turned off, and samples were
kept without breaking the vacuum inside the chamber until the system
temperature was reduced to ambient over the course of time.

For the morphological characterizations, an atomic force microscope
(AFM, XE-70, Park System, South Korea), scanning electron microscope
(SEM, CX-200, COXEM, South Korea), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscope
(EDS, Noran System 7, Thermo Fisher, USA) were adapted. The optical
spectra of the multi-metallic alloy NPs were acquired by a NOST system
(Nostoptiks, South Korea) equipped with light sources, optical microscope,
various optical components, and CCD detector. To investigate the electric
field (e-field) distributions of multi-metallic alloy NPs on sapphire,
the simulations were performed using the finite difference time domain
(FDTD) solutions (Lumerical, Canada). The dielectric constants of
Au, Pd, and Pt were referred from the Palik models,21 and the Rakic constant was used for Ag.22 For the binary and ternary alloys, the dielectric constants
were averaged from the pure Ag, Au, and Pt based on the atom % fraction.23,24 For more details, please refer the Supporting Information, Section S1.

3 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows the
fabrication overview of mono- and multi-metallic alloy NPs on sapphire
(0001) with the Ag/Pt, Ag/Au/Pt, and Ag/Au/Pd/Pt layers by the systematic
annealing at various temperatures. Depending upon the annealing temperature
and elemental configuration of multi-layer films, various configurations
and sizes of AgPt and Pt NPs were achieved, which yield the distinct
optical responses in the UV and VIS regions. The transformation of
quasi-stable multi-layers can occur due to the solid-state dewetting
(SSD) at the well-below melting point of elements in the films.25 When the thin film is deposited on a substrate
at an ambient temperature, it generally can be metastable due to the
insufficient diffusion. The surface diffusion can be activated by
annealing at a sufficient temperature, which eventually induces the
mass transport to reduce the energy at the surface and interface of
film, giving rise to the evolution of isolated NPs.26,27 The surface morphology of resulting NPs directly depends upon the
initial film thickness, diffusivity, and properties of the substrate.
From the previous studies of Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt layers on sapphire,
the Pd and Pt layers did not show any formation of definite NPs up
to 600 °C due to their low surface diffusivity, while Au and
Ag atoms dewetted well and formed the definite NPs even at ∼300
°C.28−31 In the case of bilayer or multi-layer films with various metal elements,
the dewetting process can be additionally influenced by the interdiffusion,
miscibility of the elements, surface energies, and interfacial energies
between the substrate and various metal elements.32,33

In this work, the Ag layer was deposited first as displayed
in Figure 1a for the
different
multi-layer configurations of films because of its higher surface
diffusivity and lower interface energy with the sapphire than the
other elements utilized. Also, it should be noted that the surface
energy of Ag is much lower,34 and thus,
the nucleation and growth of nanostructures can occur at a lower temperature
with the sapphire/Ag/Pt configuration. Similarly, in the case of Ag/Au/Pt
and Ag/Au/Pd/Pt multi-layer films, the atomic diffusivity decreases
from the bottom to the top layer while the surface energy increased.
Upon annealing, the metal atoms can start to intermix through the
interfaces and consequently, the interface barrier can be fully consumed
since Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt are miscible at nanoscale. Thus, the completely
intermixed AgPt, AgAuPt, and AgAuPdPt alloys can be obtained, as shown
in Figure 1b.35,36 With increasing temperature, the overall diffusion of atoms can
be enhanced, and dewetting starts to occur at the alloy phase by void
nucleation at low energy sites between the film and substrate.37 These pinholes/voids start to grow larger by
edge retraction and coalescence with the neighboring ones, and the
diffusing adatoms can start to accumulate, developing the interconnected
nanoclusters. Finally, the interconnected nanoclusters can break into
isolated islands due to the Rayleigh-like instability.32,38 In addition, the Ag atoms play another important role in the morphological
and elemental evolution of NPs by sublimation due to its high vapor
pressure.39 Ag atoms can begin to sublimate
at 440 °C with the vapor pressure of 10–11 Torr,
and the vapor pressure can reach 3 × 10–7 Torr
only at 600 °C, which is nearly a 4 orders of magnitude increase.
The rate of Ag sublimation accelerates with temperature, and thus,
finally, the Ag component can be completely desorbed from the alloy
NPs matrix resulting in the evolution of NPs without the Ag atoms,
as illustrated in Figure 1c,d. Due to the concurrent effect of dewetting and Ag sublimation,
the surface morphology of NPs along with the elemental composition
transformed largely, as depicted by the typical example of three different
alloy NPs in Figure 1d. This directly affects the LPSR intensity and peak position, as
shown by the typical extinction spectra in Figure 1e. Furthermore, the definite and isolated
NPs showed the strong e-filed enhancement at the edge of NPs based
on the excitation of various plasmonic modes, as seen in Figure 1f.

Figure 2 shows the
detailed dewetting behavior of Ag7.5nm/Pt3.75nm bilayers between 500 and 900 °C. In specific, at 500 °C,
the compact and irregular AgPt alloy NPs were formed, as shown in Figure 2a. Due to the complete
intermixing and enhanced diffusion of atoms in the AgPt system, more
definite AgPt NPs were obtained as compared to the pure Pt at this
temperature.28 The average height (AH)
and diameter (AD) of these AgPt NPs were around 50 and 20 nm, respectively,
as extracted by the cross-sectional line profile, as shown in Figure 2a-1. The AgPt NPs
gradually grew and became semispherical as the temperature increased
up to 600 °C, as shown by AFM side views. The size and shape
transformation of AgPt NPs in this temperature range can be correlated
to the coalescence growth and surface energy minimization.32 Furthermore, the growth behavior of AgPt NPs
are presented in terms of RMS roughness (Rq) and surface area ratio
(SAR), as shown in Figure 2e,f respectively. Here, the Rq represents the average surface
height fluctuations whereas the SAR represents the 3D surface area
of the nanostructures. The Rq and SAR gradually increased from 4 to
10 nm and 5 to 8%, respectively, up to 600 °C along with the
increased size of AgPt alloy NPs. However, although the enhanced dewetting
can be expected with the increased temperature, the average size,
Rq, and SAR of NPs sharply decreased between 650 and 750 °C.
The size reduction of NPs can be due to the extensive sublimation
of Ag atoms.

respectively.

To confirm the sublimation of
Ag and variation in the elemental
composition, the elemental analysis was performed by EDS, as shown
in Figure 2h,i and Figure S4. For all the samples, the EDS peaks
of Al, O, and Pt were found to be consistent. However, the Ag peaks
significantly decreased between 500 and 650 °C, suggesting the
sublimation of Ag atoms from the alloy NP matrix.39 The overall atom % of Ag and Pt at a specific temperature
are summarized in Figure 2g, which clearly showed that the atom % of Ag sharply decreased
from 78.73 to 0% between 500 and 650 °C. At temperatures greater
than 650 °C, the Ag atoms were completely sublimated, as observed
in the EDS spectra and atom % plots. Therefore, the NPs obtained above
650 °C were pure Pt NPs. At 750 °C, the typical Pt NP had
an average height and diameter of 25 and 50 nm, respectively. After
increasing the temperature up to 900 °C, the average size of
Pt NPs slightly increased, as shown in Figure 2d,d-1, which can be due to the coalescence
growth of Pt NPs to gain the thermal stability with the low energy
configuration.40 The corresponding Rq and
SAR values were found to be somewhat similar, which can be due to
the counterbalance between the minor size increase and density decrease
along with diffusion. Meanwhile, it was also found that the uniformity
and configuration of Pt NPs were improved at high temperatures. By
comparing with the Pt NPs fabricated with the pure Pt film dewetting,
significant improvement in terms of size, spacing, and uniformity
was observed in this set.28

Figure 3 presents
the LSPR properties of AgPt and Pt NPs fabricated with the Ag7.5nm/Pt3.75nm bilayers. The optical spectra demonstrated
the wavelength-dependent characteristics along with the evolution
of AgPt and Pt NPs at various temperatures. As shown in Figure 3a, the extinction spectra generally
exhibited a strong and broad peak in the VIS region and a weak peak
in the UV region for both AgPt and Pt NPs. In this set, the average
size of AgPt alloy and Pt NPs was ∼20 nm in height and ∼50
nm diameter with the semispherical configurations, as discussed. Thus,
the extinction peaks in the VIS and UV regions can be generated by
the excitation of the dipolar (DR) and quadrupolar resonance (QR)
modes of the small NPs.41,42 A detailed analysis
of extinction spectra with the AgPt and Pt NPs was performed after
the normalization, as shown in Figure 3a-1,a-2. The DR band of the AgPt NP did not show much
variation between 500 and 600 °C although the NPs size increased,
which can be due to the corresponding loss of Ag atoms along with
the sublimation. Since the LSPR response is much stronger with Ag
than Pt, the reduction of Ag component can correspondingly dampen
the plasmonic intensity of the AgPt alloy NPs.42−44

view) and xz plane (side view).

After the formation of Pt NPs above 650 °C, the DR was significantly
reduced as shown in Figure 3a,a-2 due to the weaker LSPR response of Pt than AgPt NPs.
It was also noted that the peak center gradually blue-shifted with
the evolution of Pt NPs due to the size reduction. The overall blue
shift of the DR peak from ∼505 to 460 nm was traced in Figure 3a-3. Furthermore,
the peaks gradually narrowed as the Pt NP became more uniform at increased
temperatures. For the detailed understanding on the plasmon resonance
and localized e-field distribution, a typical semispherical Pt NP
(AD, ∼50 nm and AH, ∼20 nm) was simulated, as shown
in Figure 3d–f.
The corresponding extinction spectra and e-field vector are provided
in Figure S5, which showed the DR at ∼470
nm for the typical Pt NPs. From the simulation results, it was found
that the e-field was strongly confined at the surface of NP, as seen
in Figure 3e,f, but
the higher order resonance peak was not observed. The resonance peak
in the simulated extinction slightly varied (∼10 nm red shift)
from the experimental one, which could be due to the size distribution
of NPs in the real sample. Figure 3b,b-1 shows the corresponding reflectance spectra,
which exhibit a minor dip in the UV region and a wide dip in the VIS
region corresponding to the QR and DR bands, as discussed. Along with
the sublimation of Ag, the VIS dip was gradually attenuated, as shown
in Figure 3b-1, which
can be correlated to the reduced absorption as well as the increased
backscattering effect with the smaller size NPs. With the formation
of Pt NPs, the reflectance dips were minorly attenuated due to the
removal of the Ag component.41,42 In addition, the size
reduction can also affect the dip intensity in the reflectance spectra.
Similarly, the transmittance spectra in Figure 3c–c-2 exhibited a dip in the UV and
VIS regions corresponding to the QR and DR modes with the AgPt and
Pt NPs. The peak and dip gradually weakened along with Ag sublimation
and size reduction, as discussed. The transmittance dips also clearly
blue-shifted between ∼460 and 520 nm and narrowed as shown
in Figure 3c-3 as the
NP size was reduced and uniformity was improved.

Figure 4 displays
the fabrication of AgAuPt and AuPt alloy NPs with the Ag55nm/Au15nm/Pt15nm tri-layers annealed between
550 and 900 °C. The dewetting of Ag/Au/Pt tri-layers demonstrated
various evolution stages such as void nucleation, void growth, interconnected
nanoclusters, and isolated NP formation.40 The general dewetting behavior of the Ag/Au/Pt tri-layers was similar
to that of the mono-metallic layer because of the miscible nature
of Ag, Au, and Pt atoms at applied growth conditions.36,45 As discussed, the deposition sequence of tri-layers was adapted
based on the decreasing diffusivity of metal atoms from the bottom
to the top layer. Because of the high surface diffusivity, low surface,
and interface energy of bottom layers, the overall atomic intermixing,
diffusivity, and the dewetting process can be enhanced, as discussed.
On the other hand, due to the increased layer thickness and different
metallic interfaces, the interdiffusion process may also require additional
thermal energy to completely intermix the tri-layers.46−48 Thus, the overall dewetting can be progressed at a slower phase
with the tri-layers. For instance, the void nucleation and connected
nanocluster growth occurred at 550 °C, as shown in Figure 4a, while the surface roughness
only minorly evolved at lower temperatures. The void width was extended
up to 2 μm, while the nanocluster height was ∼250 nm,
as observed in the AFM 3D side views and cross-sectional line profiles.
The large-scale AFM and SEM images of this set are provided in Figures S10 and S11. Along with the increased
temperature, the voids grew further, resulting in the network-like
nanoclusters, as seen in Figure 4b,c. Since the average height and surface area increased
with the evolution of interconnected nanoclusters, the Rq and SAR
also increased, as presented in Figure 4g,h.

annealing between 550 and 900 °C for 120 s. (a–f) AFM
images of the alloy nanostructures. The corresponding line profiles
are shown below the AFM images. (g–i) Summary plots of Rq,
SAR, and atom % of Ag, Au, and Pt, respectively. (j–m) SEM
image and corresponding elemental maps of Ag, Au, and Pt for the sample
fabricated at 600 °C. (n, o) EDS spectra of the AgAuPt and AuPt
alloy NPs at 500 and 650 °C, respectively.

The elemental analysis was performed for the sample annealed at
600 °C, as shown in Figure 4j–m. The SEM images and elemental maps of Ag,
Au, and Pt matched each other well. This clearly indicates that Ag,
Au, and Pt atoms were homogeneously intermixed in the alloy nanostructures.
From the EDS spectra of AgAuPt alloy nanostructures at 500 °C,
it can be observed that all Ag, Au, and Pt peaks were presented; however,
at 650 °C, the Ag peaks completely vanished due to the sublimation.
This again confirmed that the nanostructures were AgAuPt alloy up
to 600 °C but were AuPt alloy above 650 °C. The corresponding
variation of elemental compositions is summarized by the atom % plots
in Figure 4i, which
clearly showed a sharp decrement in the atom % of Ag between 500 and
600 °C. The surface morphology largely transformed above 650
°C as the interconnected nanoclusters showed the fluctuation
in local width and started to break, as shown in Figure 4d. This evolution can be simultaneously
affected by the Ag sublimation and Rayleigh-like instability.38 The Rq and SAR values slightly increased as
the number of isolated structures increased despite the average size
reduction. Between 700 and 900 °C, the interconnected AuPt nanoclusters
were further fragmented and subsequently transformed toward spherical
shape as seen in Figure 4e,f to reduce the overall energy of the surface and interface.49 This process can be ascribed to the tendency
to reach the equilibrium shape. Once the fragmentation of large nanoclusters
was finished, the isolated NPs tend to stabilize by merging with the
neighboring ones, which results in the reduced areal density and relatively
larger size of NPs. This was also shown by the decreasing trend of
Rq and SAR.

Figure 5 shows the
optical properties of AgAuPt and AuPt alloy NPs. Depending upon the
variation of structures and elemental compositions, the LSPR properties
were drastically varied from the previous set. As shown in Figure 5a, the extinction
spectra demonstrated distinct spectral shape for the samples annealed
below and above 600 °C. In specific, the partially dewetted AgAuPt
nanoclusters (<600 °C) exhibited two peaks: one in the UV
region and another in the VIS region, whereas the smaller AuPt NPs
(>650 °C) showed weaker and broader UV and VIS peaks, as seen
in Figure 5a-1,a-2.
In general, the LSPR peaks were broader as compared to the small and
isolated NPs in the previous set. Because of the large size of nanoclusters
and NPs (above 1 μm), the extinction peaks in the UV and VIS
wavelength can be assigned to the excitation of higher order resonance
(HR) and multi-polar resonance (MR,) respectively.13 At increased temperatures, the LSPR peak intensity of AgAuPt
NP gradually decreased, as shown in Figure 5a-1, which can be due to the Ag sublimation,
as discussed. With the formation of the first connected and then isolated
AuPt NPs at higher temperatures, the extinction spectra showed much
wider and weaker peaks in the VIS region (420–580 nm), as shown
in Figure 5a-2. Furthermore,
the broadening effect of the VIS peaks along with the temperature
is traced in Figure 5a-3. In contrast to the previous sets, this is an opposite behavior
with the improved uniformity of the NPs. However, the broader LSPR
response can be caused by the presence of Au component in the AuPt
NPs due to the excitation of plasmon band at the longer VIS wavelength.
The simulated e-field profile and the vector plot at the MR of a typical
AuPt alloy NP are presented in Figure 5d–f, which showed the stronger intensity at
the NP/sapphire interface due to the strong plasmonic confinement.
In addition, the simulated extinction spectrum is presented in Figure S14, which exhibited two peaks corresponding
to the HR and MR at 420 and 660 nm. These peak positions red-shifted
with the stronger intensity as compared to the measured spectra, which
can be due to the structural disparity in the simulated NP and real
samples such as wide size and shape variation. The MR peak was found
to be broader and much stronger likely due to the stronger resonance
in the VIS region. Similarly, the reflectance spectra of AgAuPt and
AuPt alloy nanoclusters are shown in Figure 5b,b-3, which generally exhibited two dips
in the UV region at ∼450 nm and in the VIS region at ∼500
nm, corresponding to the HR and MR resonance, as discussed. The absorption
dips of the AgAuPt alloy nanocluster were gradually attenuated and
became broader with the sublimation of Ag atoms, as shown in Figure 5b-1.43,44 Furthermore, the evolution of AuPt nanocluster at increased temperatures
caused the gradual flattening of the reflectance dips, as shown in Figure 5b-2,b-3, which can
be due to the reduced absorption as the NP size was reduced. In the
case of transmittance spectra, it did not exhibit obvious peaks or
dip formation with the large AgAuPt and AgPt alloy nanoclusters, as
shown in Figure 5c.
Since the nanoclusters were generally large with more than 1 μm
average diameter, the transmittance spectra can be strongly affected
by the pronounced forward scattering.50 This can result in the flat transmittance even at the resonance
wavelength.

Figure 6 presents
the evolution of AgAuPdPt and AuPdPt alloy nanoclusters from the Ag40nm/Au15nm/Pd15nm/Pt15nm quad-layers
film by annealing between 550 and 900 °C for 120 s. The overall
dewetting stages such as the hole initiation, hole growth, and interconnected
nanoclusters were similar with the previous set. However, the dewetting
extent was significantly altered, and thus, the resulting surface
morphology of NPs was also drastically different at a specific temperature
from the previous set. The quad-layers configuration of Ag/Au/Pd/Pt
was adapted based on the diffusivity of metal as discussed. Since
the Ag content decreased and the Pd layer was added at a constant
total thickness, the dewetting process further slowed down because
of the lower diffusivity of Pd atoms.32,34 Furthermore,
with the increased number of various atomic layers and interfaces,
the intermixing process can also be slowed down as well. However,
the miscible nature of Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt atoms can induce similar
dewetting stages as in the previous set. Along with the increased
temperature, the intermixing between the atoms occurred at the interfaces
of Ag/Au, Au/Pd, and Pd/Pt, and this can result in the completely
alloyed layer, which starts to dewet by the void formation, as shown
in Figure 6a. The void
size varied between 500 and 1000 nm, as shown by the cross-sectional
line profile in Figure 6a-1. At 550 °C, the size of voids was significantly small and
less in number as compared to the previous set, which clearly indicates
the low dewetting extent with the quad-layers configuration. The voids
gradually increased by the coalescence of neighboring ones at 600
°C, as observed in Figure 6b. The corresponding large-scale AFM and SEM images are provided Figures S15 and S16.

maps of Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt for alloy nanoclusters fabricated at 600

alloy NPs at 500 and 650 °C, respectively.

From the Rq and SAR plots in Figure 6g,h, they slightly increased along with the void growth
between 500 and 600 °C. The detailed elemental characterization
of AgAuPdPt alloy nanoclusters at 600 °C is presented in Figure 6j–n. The SEM
images and elemental maps of Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt matched well, suggesting
the homogeneous alloy formation in the nanoclusters. The detailed
EDS map and line profiles are shown in Figure S18. In addition, the Ag sublimation was confirmed by the EDS
spectra and summary of atom % plots in Figure 6i,o,p in which the Ag peaks and atom % sharply
decreased between 500 and 600 °C. Above 650 °C, the atom
% of Ag became zero, and the corresponding Ag peaks vanished, as observed
in Figure 6p. Therefore,
the nanoclusters obtained at above 650 °C only consisted of Au,
Pd, and Pt. Since the Ag atoms were completely desorbed around 650
°C, the surface evolution of nanoclusters occurred somewhat mildly.
As shown in Figure 6c–f, the connected nanoclusters gradually evolved with the
increased spacing and branch width. However, the dewetting was not
sufficient to generate isolated NPs up to 900 °C. Due to the
formation of larger nanoclusters from the layered structures at increased
temperatures, the Rq gradually increased. However, the SAR gradually
decreased above 700 °C as the surface coverage was significantly
reduced.

Figure 7 shows the
optical properties of AgAuPdPt and AuPdPt alloy nanostructures fabricated
with the Ag40nm/Au15nm/Pd15nm/Pt15nm quad-layers. As shown in Figure 7a, the extinction spectra generally exhibited
two strong peaks in the UV and VIS regions with the large alloy nanoclusters.
In the case of large nanoclusters, the UV and VIS extinction peaks
can be assigned to the excitation of MR and HR, respectively, as discussed.13 As in the previous cases, the LSPR peaks were
gradually attenuated and broadened along with the sublimation of Ag
atoms, as shown in Figure 7a-1, indicating the dampening of the plasmonic effect. In
contrast to the AgAuPt tri-alloy nanoclusters in the previous set,
the AgAuPdPt quad-alloy nanoclusters showed the peak narrowing along
with the dewetting of large voids. With the formation of AuPdPt nanocluster
above 650 °C, the LSPR peaks further weakened and narrowed, as
shown in Figure 7a-2.
Furthermore, the MR in the VIS region showed a gradual blue shift
at the increased temperature, as shown in Figure 7a-3, which can be due to the average size
reduction of the alloy nanoclusters. From the FDTD simulation of typical
AuPdPt alloy NP, it exhibited a relatively weaker e-field enhancement
than previous sets, as shown in Figure 7d,e. Since the alloy NPs are generally large and irregular
in shape, the e-field was distributed throughout the boundary of nanostructure,
and the vector plot also showed multiple e-field directions, as observed
in Figure 7e,f. The
corresponding extinction spectrum of the typical AuPdPt alloy NP is
shown in Figure S19, which exhibited two
peaks at 390 and 650 nm. The peaks were much broader and tend to overlap
likely due to the excitation of the multiple and higher order resonance
bands. As compared to the previous set, the overall e-field intensity
for high-temperature samples was weaker, which can be correlated to
the addition of Pd while reducing Au and the wide coverage of NPs.

In addition, the reflectance spectra in Figure 7b also clearly show
the formation of a narrow
dip in the UV region and a wide dip in the VIS region. The reflectance
dips correspond to the extinction peaks, which denotes the absorption
bands due to the excitation of various LSPR, as discussed. The reflectance
dip intensity gradually decreased with the evolution of voids and
nanoclusters, as shown in Figure 7b-1, which can be correlated to the Ag sublimation
as well as size reduction.43,44 The absorption dips
were further reduced with the formation of AuPdPt alloy NPs at high
temperatures, as shown in Figure 7b-2. It was also observed that the VIS dip gradually
blue-shifted with the size reduction of nanoclusters, as shown in Figure 7b-3. In the case
of transmittance spectra, as displayed in Figure 7c, it generally showed the flat response
with both AgAuPdPt and AuPdPt alloy nanoclusters. Because of the large
nanoclusters, the absorption dips in transmittance spectra may not
be observed due to the strong forward scattering of large alloy nanoclusters,
as discussed.13 However, a minor reduction
of transmittance in the VIS region was realized for high-temperature
samples, which can be due to the reduced forward scattering with the
reduced size.

4 Conclusions
In summary,
the various multi-metallic alloy nanostructures of
novel metals (Ag, Au, Pd, and Pt) were demonstrated on c-plane sapphire (0001) along with their optical properties, which
can be potential candidates in various plasmonic applications. In
specific, Pt, AgPt, AgAuPt, and AgAuPdPt alloy NPs of various sizes,
shapes, and densities were fabricated based on the self-assembly of
sputtered metallic Ag/Pt bilayers, Ag/Au/Pt tri-layers, and Ag/Au/Pd/Pt
quad-layers. The systematic annealing of various multi-layers led
to the solid-state dewetting based on the enhanced diffusion, interdiffusion,
and energy minimization mechanism. It was also observed that the mass
driven self-assembly of the various multi-metallic alloyed nanostructures
was accompanied by the sublimation of Ag atoms, which makes the growth
behavior more dynamic as compared to the conventional SSD. In specific,
the Ag atoms were extensively sublimated up to 650 °C along with
the rapid dewetting of alloyed nanostructures, and thus, the NPs at
higher temperatures did not consist of Ag. The overall dewetting of
various metallic multi-layers was found to be similar to that of the
mono-metallic film because of the enhanced miscibility of Ag, Au,
Pd, and Pt atoms at nanoscale. However, the dewetting kinetics and
hence the resulting nanostructures significantly varied from mono-metallic
counterparts. These alloy nanostructures exhibited dynamic LSPR responses
in the visible region and a minor resonance peak in the UV region.
The size, shape, density, and elemental composition of the multi-metallic
alloy NPs readily altered the LSPR properties. For instance, the VIS
band generally blue-shifted with the size reduction whereas it was
dampened with the reduced Ag percentage. Furthermore, the excitation
of various plasmonic modes such as dipolar, quadrupolar, multi-polar,
and higher order was observed with the various surface morphologies
of the multi-metallic alloy nanostructures.
