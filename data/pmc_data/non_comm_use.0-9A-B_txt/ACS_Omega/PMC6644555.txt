We have explored the effect of ring
size on keto–enol tautomerization
of α- and β-cyclodiones using the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. The calculated results
show that the activation free energy barrier for the keto–enol
tautomerization process of α-cyclopropanedione (1) is 54.9 kcal/mol, which is lower compared to that of the other
cyclic diketo systems studied here. The four-membered α- and
β-cyclobutanedione (2 and 6) do not
favor keto–enol tautomerization unlike other studied cyclic systems
because of the ring strain developed in the transition-state geometries
and their corresponding products. Water-assisted keto–enol
tautomerization with one molecule reveals that the free energy activation
barriers reduce almost half compared to those for the uncatalyzed
systems. The two-water-assisted process is favorable as the activation
free energy barriers lowered by ∼10 kcal/mol compared to those
of the one-water-assisted process. The ion-pair formation seems to
govern the lowering of activation barriers of α- and β-cyclodiones
with two water molecules during the keto–enol tautomerization
process, which however also overcomes the favorable aromatization
in the three-membered ring system. The free energy activation barriers
calculated with the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level predicted
that the keto–enol tautomerization process for the α-cyclodiones
follows the following trend: 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 1. Water-assisted
tautomerization
of α-cyclodiones also predicted 1-W and 1-2W as the most favored processes; however, 5-W and 5-2W were found to be disfavored in this case. The β-cyclodione
systems also showed similar trends as obtained with α-diketone
systems. The influence of bulk solvent on the keto–enol tautomerization
process favors the formation of the enol form in a more polar solvent
medium even under mixed solvent conditions in acetonitrile and hexane
at M062X-SMDacetonitrile/6-31+G(d,p) and M062X-SMDhexane/6-31+G(d,p) levels of theory.

Introduction
Tautomerization is
known to be one of the essential processes in
chemistry and biology, more specifically, keto–enol and amino–imino
tautomerizations.1−4 The mechanistic pathways of keto–enol tautomerization, the
influence of solvent molecules, and the role of different substituents
have been investigated.3,5−17 It has been reported that the enols derived from unhindered, unconjugated
ketones are present in a minuscule amount at equilibrium.8 Research efforts have been put forward to design
systems to improve the enol content. Keto–enol tautomerization
has been observed in many biological processes that directly or indirectly
proceed through keto–enol or amino–imino tautomerism,
e.g., pyranose to furanose ring conversion of cyclic carbohydrate,
glucose to fructose conversion, etc.18−20 Keto–enol tautomerism
also plays an important role in the formation of kynurenic acid, an
antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant compound, which is generated due
to the metabolism of l-tryptophan.21−23 In the keto–enol
tautomerization equilibrium process, one proton transfers from the
α-carbon center to carbonyl oxygen through space via bond formation.24−27 This proton transfer process is accelerated in the presence of solvent
molecules or by suitable substituents.26−36 In the case of acyclic ketone, reports reveal that the keto form
is more stable in a polar solvent compared with the enol forms.24

The proton transfer in the keto–enol
tautomerization process
can be acid- or base-catalyzed in different solvent media.37 In this regard, water-assisted keto–enol
tautomerization processes have been investigated. The water-assisted
keto–enol tautomerization process was called the “bifunctional
water-catalyzed proton transfer” process because in such keto–enol
tautomerization a water molecule acts as both a proton donor and a
proton acceptor.27,38−45

Keto–enol tautomerization of α-cyclopropanedione
(cyclopropane-1,2-dione, 1), an enolizable α(α)
diketone, has been studied
experimentally and theoretically.46−48 The keto–enol
form is more stable compared with the diketo form because of the aromatic
character of the keto–enol form having two π-electrons.
Furthermore, α-cyclodiones and β-cyclodiones have been
extensively studied because of their use in organic chemistry and
also because they are well studied by crystallographers.7−10,13,49−60 The presence of cyclic-α-diketones and cyclic-β-diketones in various
crystals results in significant optical, electrical, and magnetic
properties of the respective crystals. Not only these compounds exhibit
substantial applications in the optical field as a fluorescence probe
and laser material, but also their keto–enol tautomerization
process has a significant role in various chemical reactions.17,61,62 The aerobic oxidation of cyclopentane-1,2-diols
to the corresponding diketones over a commercial heterogeneous Pt/C
catalyst was studied previously.63 Tautomerization
of 1,2-cyclohexanedione has also been examined computationally and
experimentally.64−66 There are also reports on direct α-alkylation
of 1,2-cyclohexanedione and its enolization, which occurs via its
dianionic form.67,68 Keto–enol tautomerization
of cyclic-α-diketones and cyclic-β-diketones has been
studied by many research groups; however, the effects of ring size
on the keto–enol tautomerization process and the role of solvents
on such systems have not been explored in the literature.

In
this article, we have examined the effect of ring size, i.e.,
of three-to-seven-membered rings with α-cyclopropanedione (cyclopropane-1,2-dione, 1), α-cyclobutanedione (cyclobutane-1,2-dione, 2), α-cyclopentanedione (cyclopentane-1,3-dione, 3), α-cyclohexanedione (cyclohexane-1,2-dione, 4), and α-cycloheptanedione (cycloheptane-1,2-dione, 5), computationally (see Scheme 1 and Figure 1). We have also studied β-cyclodiketones, e.g.,
β-cyclobutanedione (cyclobutane-1,3-dione, 6),
β-cyclopentanedione (cyclopentane-1,3-dione, 7),
β-cyclohexanedione (cyclohexane-1,3-dione, 8),
and β-cycloheptanedione (cycloheptane-1,3-dione, 9), to examine the keto–enol tautomerism mechanism at the same
level of theory. The solvent effect on such keto–enol tautomerism
has been examined in the presence of the explicit water molecules
and implicit SMD solvation model where water (ε = 78.8), acetonitrile
(ε = 35.7), and n-hexane (ε = 1.9) have
been used as solvents.13

Scheme 1 Water-Unassisted and -Assisted Keto–Enol
Tautomerization Process
for 1,2- and 1,3-Cyclic Diketo Systems
Results and Discussion
α-Cyclodiones
The keto–enol
tautomerized
form of cyclopropane-1,2-dione (1) is of considerable
interest and is known as a photochemical precursor to hydroxyacetylene.46 It is reported in the literature that the keto–enol
form of 1 is more stable compared with the diketo form
because of aromatization in the keto–enol form.22 The activation free energy barrier for the keto–enol
tautomerization process of cyclopropane-1,2-dione is 54.9 kcal/mol,
and the keto–enol form, hydroxycyclopropenone, is stable by
18.2 kcal/mol compared with the diketo form in the aqueous phase at
the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of
theory. The enol form could exist in two different conformations,
i.e., the cis conformation, the hydroxyl group orientated toward the
keto group to form a hydrogen bond, and the trans orientation (Figure S1). It is worth mentioning here that
the cis conformers are generally more stable compared with the trans
conformers because of the O–H···O hydrogen bonding
interaction. In an earlier report, the calculations performed with
the PCM-B3LYP/6-31++G(d,p) and PCM-MP2/6-31++G(d,p) levels of theory
also suggest that the keto–enol form is stable by ∼20
kcal/mol.46

The cyclobutane ring
is a strained system and prefers to adopt a puckered conformation.
The presence of two carbonyl groups in the cyclobutanedione ring forces
it to be planar than the preferred puckered structure (Figure 1). The geometries optimized
using M062X/6-31+G(d,p) reveal that the diketo form (2) and the keto–enol form are planar in their ground-state
geometries (Figure 1). The M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)-calculated free energy
of activation is 75.5 kcal/mol, and the diketo form is energetically
favored compared with the keto–enol form by 6.0 kcal/mol. The
presence of three sp2-hybridized carbon atoms in the keto–enol
form of the four-membered ring causes more strain compared to that
in the diketo form with two sp2-hybridized carbon atoms.
There are a few reports on cyclobutane derivatives to stabilize the
enol forms using fluoro substituents.8,9 The thermodynamic
stability achieved for the enol forms than for the corresponding keto
forms is due to the greater destabilization of the later form. The
free energy activation barrier calculated with the higher homologue,
i.e., cyclopentane-1,2-dione (3), is 70.1 kcal/mol, and
the keto–enol form is stable by 2.1 kcal/mol compared with
the diketo form. The cyclohexane ring always prefers the chair conformation,
and we have observed that the diketo form also preferred the chair
conformation; however, the keto–enol form exists in an envelope-like
conformation and is energetically favored by ∼1 kcal/mol (Table 1). The experimental
results corroborate keto–enol formation in cyclohexane-1,2-dione.64,66 The M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)-calculated activation free
energy barrier for cyclohexane-1,2-dione (4) is 67.3
kcal/mol. An alkyl substitution in the ring system can improve the
enol formation in cyclohexane-1,2-diketone.67,68 The experimental report reveals that the appropriate substituents
at the proper position can influence the keto–enol tautomerization
process in cyclohexane ring systems.67,68 The cycloheptane
ring is one of the larger ring systems, and the angle strain does
not allow it to exist in a planar conformation. The diketo (5, Figure 1) form always exists in a puckered conformation, and two carbonyl
groups orient opposite to each other. The keto–enol form, however,
adopts an envelope-like structure, which suffers from more ring strain
compared to that in the diketo form. The calculated activation free
energy barrier for cycloheptane-1,2-dione (5) is 64.0
kcal/mol, whereas the keto–enol form is energetically unstable
by 0.9 kcal/mol compared with the diketo form. The activation free
energy barriers and the reaction energies calculated at the MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) levels of theory are in
good agreement with those calculated at M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
levels of theory (Table S1).

The mechanism of keto–enol tautomerism studied
computationally
and experimentally suggests that the proton of the Cα carbon
center transfers through space via bond formation in the transition
state (Figure 2).24,28 We have examined this process while running the intrinsic reaction
coordinate (IRC) calculations of keto–enol tautomerism of three-to-seven-membered
rings in the gas phase. The IRC calculations suggest that hydrogen
(α-carbon) is transferred to the oxygen of the carbonyl group
following three steps: (i) C–H bond breaking, (ii) movement
of the proton toward the carbonyl group through space, and (iii) O–H
bond formation. The transition-state (TS) geometry analyses for the
cyclic-1,2-diones (1–5) suggests
that the distance between the proton of α-carbon (H4, atom number
4, see Figure 1) and
the carbonyl group of oxygen (O1, atom number 1, see Figure 1) decreases with the increasing
ring size (Figure 2). The observed longest distance is 1.39 Å for the three-membered
ring (1-TS), and the shortest one is 1.29 Å for
the seven-membered ring (5-TS, Figure 2). The calculated dihedral angle O1–C2–C3–H4
is −56.9 for the three-membered ring, −62.0 for the
four-membered ring, −34.91 for the five-membered ring, 12.59
for the six-membered ring, and −4.25 for the seven-membered
ring (Figure 1). The
dihedral angle analyses suggest that proton transfer through space
is easier for larger ring systems compared with the smaller rings.
In the case of the seven-membered ring system, the oxygen (O1) of
the carbonyl group and the hydrogen (H4) of the α-carbon lie
almost in the same plane, which facilitates through the space proton
transfer process.

Figure 2 All of the transition-state structures and corresponding
distances
are given in angstrom. The distance between the proton of α-carbon
center and carbonyl oxygen is decreasing with the increasing ring
size. Key: yellow, C; red, O; and white, H.

β-Cyclodiones
The keto–enol tautomerization
process for the β-cyclodiones is very similar to that of the
corresponding cyclic-1,2-diketo systems. The M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p)-calculated activation free energy
barrier is 70.3 kcal/mol for cyclobutane-1,3-dione (6); and the keto–enol form is unstable by 4.6 kcal/mol. There
are two possible enolizable CH2 sites available in the
five, six, and seven-membered β-cyclodiones. However, H4 is
more acidic compared with H5, and subsequently, H4 is enolized (Figure 1). The density functional
theory (DFT)-calculated activation free energy barrier for the enolization
of H4 in cyclopentane-1,3-dione (7) is 64.0 kcal/mol,
and the corresponding keto–enol form is unstable by 0.3 kcal/mol
in the aqueous phase. On the other hand, the activation free energy
barrier for the enolization of H5 is 71.6, and the corresponding keto–enol
form is unstable by 11.2 kcal/mol (Table S3). Similar trends were also observed for six- and seven-membered
rings (Table S3). The previously reported
result also shows that the activation energy barrier for 7 is 64.4 kcal/mol; however, the keto–enol form was found to
be marginally stable, ∼2.0 kcal/mol, at the CPCM-B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory in the aqueous medium.69 The activation free energy barrier is 58.4 kcal/mol for cyclohexane-1,3-dione
(8) and 55.3 kcal/mol for cycloheptane-1,3-dione (9). The report on cyclohexane-1,3-dione with the IEF-PCM/B3LYP/6-31G(d)
level of theory suggests that the keto–enol form is unstable
by 1.8–1.2 kcal/mol as observed in this study (Table 1).56 The transition-state geometry analyses suggest that the distances
between the carbonyl oxygen (O1) and proton of α-carbon (H4)
have been decreased in transition-state geometries with increasing
the ring size for the 1,3-diketo systems, i.e., 1.36 Å for the
four-membered ring (6-TS), 1.33 Å for the five-membered
ring (7-TS), 1.30 Å for the six-membered ring (8-TS), and 1.26 Å for the seven-membered ring (9-TS, Figure 2). Similarly, the torsional angles for the 1,3-diketo system are
−54.99 for the four-membered ring, −50.18 for the five-membered
ring, 18.45 for the six-membered ring, and 8.16 for the seven-membered
ring (Figure 1). The
geometrical analysis also suggests easy proton transfer process in
larger ring systems.

The calculated results suggest that the
activation free energy barrier for 2 is higher than for 6 by 5.4 kcal/mol. In 6-TS, two carbonyl groups
are oriented opposite to each other, whereas in 2-TS,
two carbonyl groups align in a plane (Figure 2) and produce severe lone pair–lone
pair repulsion, which destabilizes 2-TS compared with 6-TS. The above computational study demonstrated that the
activation energy barrier for the cyclic-1,2-dione systems is higher
compared to that for the corresponding cyclic-1,3-dione systems because
of the repulsion between the lone pairs of adjacent carbonyl oxygen
atoms. Furthermore, geometry analyses also reveal that the distances
between the proton of α-carbon (H4) and oxygen carbonyl group
(O1) for cyclic-1,3-diones are smaller than those for the corresponding
cyclic-1,2-diones, which lowers the activation free energy barrier
for the cyclic-1,3-diones. The free energy activation barriers calculated
for the cyclic-1,2-diketo system for the keto–enol process
follow the following trend: 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 1, and a similar trend
was
also noticed for the cyclic-1,3-diketo systems.

Nucleus-Independent
Chemical Shift (NICS) Calculation
We have further performed
the nucleus-independent chemical shift
(NICS) calculations for each transition-state structures at the M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
level with the SMD solvation model.70−75 NICS defines the absolute magnetic shielding value computed at the
center of the system (NICS(0)) or 1 Å, (NICS(1)), 2 Å (NICS(2)),
or 3 Å (NICS(3)) above or below the center. It is reported that
the NICS(0) index is influenced by the local contributions of the
σ framework; the in-plane contributions of the π-system;
and the −CH, −NC, and −CC single bonds. However,
NICS(1) is devoid of the local contributions of the σ framework
as well as CH, NC, and CC single bonds. It has been widely considered
as a better measure of π effects than NICS(0).72 The systems having a higher negative NICS(1) value exhibit
more aromatic characteristics, whereas systems with a positive NICS(1)
value pose anti-aromatic or nonaromatic characteristics. To examine
the aromatic character developed in the transition state during the
keto–enol process, we have carried out NICS(1)zz calculations
and observed that the TS of the three-membered (1-TS)
ring has the higher negative NICS value compared to that of the other rings (Table 1). The NICS(1)zz calculations
revealed that 1-TS has the higher aromaticity compared
to that of the other ring systems. On the other hand, the keto–enol
form of the three-membered ring has higher aromaticity (−9.8)
compared to that of the other ring systems (Table S2). This is to note here that the calculated NICS(1)zz values
for aromaticity of nonplanar and nonconjugate systems may not be the
exact aromaticity values as the program is designed for the planar
and conjugate systems.

Water-Assisted Tautomerization
We
have extended DFT
calculations with one water molecule to examine the catalytic effect
on the keto–enol tautomerization process. It is reported in
the literature that the presence of a single water molecule can affect
the activation free energy barrier,26 and
it becomes almost half of the uncatalyzed activation free energy barrier.
The calculated results show that the water molecule initially interacts
with the carbonyl group through H-bonding interactions (Figure S2). In the case of 1,2-diketo systems,
there is a possibility that the water molecule can also interact with
the two carbonyl groups via hydrogen bonding interactions. However,
such geometries were not obtained for 1-W, 2-W, and 4-W. Nevertheless, hydrogen-bonded 3-W and 5-W have been located at the same level of theory,
but these geometries are energetically less stable than those where
the water molecule interacts with a carbonyl group and the adjacent
CH2 group (Figure S2). The distance
between the carbonyl groups in the cyclic systems governs the formation
of hydrogen-bonded structures with the water molecule. The geometry
in the water-assisted
tautomerization process has been observed as described in the literature.38,69 The water-assisted proton transfer process to carbonyl oxygen in
keto–enol tautomerization occurs through the water molecule.
The water-mediated proton transfer process facilitates the tautomerization
process, and the activation free energy barrier is almost half of
the water uncatalyzed barrier (Tables 1 and 2). The calculated activation
free energy barriers for cyclopropane-1,2-dione in the presence of
one water molecule (1-W, Figure S2) are 15.2 and 37.9 kcal/mol for cyclobutane-1,2-dione (2-W), 34.3 kcal/mol for cyclopentane-1,2-dione (3-W), 34.7 kcal/mol for cyclohexane-1,2-dione (4-W), and
48.2 kcal/mol for cycloheptane-1,2-dione (5-W) at the
M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory.
On the other hand, the activation free energy barriers with one water
molecule for cyclic-1,3-diketo systems are 30.2, 28.6, 29.7, and 30.5
kcal/mol for four- (6-W), five- (7-W), six-
(8-W), and seven-membered (9-W) rings, respectively.
The results reveal that water-catalyzed keto–enol tautomerization
in the aqueous phase affects the smaller ring system more compared
with the larger ring systems. The computed results show that the activation
free energy barrier for the four-membered ring (2-W)
is higher compared to that for the five- (3-W) and six-membered
(4-W) rings. Importantly, the free energy activation
barrier calculated for cycloheptane-1,2-dione (5-W) is
highest in this series, which shows the opposite trend to that of
the results obtained without the water molecule. The water molecule
in TS geometry (5-W-TS) induces ring strain that causes
the ring to be highly distorted and subsequently increases the activation
free energy barrier for keto–enol tautomerization compared
to that for the other cyclic-1,2-diketo systems (Figure 3). The observed trend for the
activation energy barrier for the cyclic-1,2-diketo system is 5-W > 2-W > 4-W > 3-W > 1-W, and cyclic-1,3-diketo systems also
showed a
similar trend in the aqueous medium. The keto–enol form of
the water-assisted tautomerization process is more stable compared
to that of the water-unassisted tautomerization process. However,
the trans conformer of the keto–enol form is marginally stable
than that of the cis conformer in the presence of water molecule unlike
in the absence of water molecule. The water molecule facilitates the
formation of hydrogen bond in the trans conformer. Furthermore, activation
free energy barriers and the reaction energies calculated at MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p) levels of theory corroborate the results calculated
at M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) levels of
theory (Table S1).

The one-water-assisted keto–enol
tautomerization process
for α- and β-cyclodiones is energetically favored as observed
in this study. Therefore, it is important to examine the role of the
additional water molecule in these keto–enol tautomerization
processes. This is to note that the process involving a proton transfer
assisted with two water molecules is even biologically significant.76 Tautomerization assisted with two water molecules
has been examined in two possible orientations. In the first case,
the additional water molecule is not directly participating in the
proton transfer process (Figure S3). The
second water molecule interacts with the carbonyl group, which is
not directly involved in the keto–enol process. In the second
case, the two water molecules facilitate the proton transfer process,
and similar processes have also been reported.38 We have determined the stability of keto–enol tautomers
and the activation barriers with two water molecules at the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. The proton transfer process
mediated by two water molecules in keto–enol tautomerization
is energetically favored compared with the first case (Figures 4, S3, Tables 3, and S4). The incorporation of second water molecule
facilitates the transfer of proton and hence affects the activation
barriers significantly. The activation free energy barrier calculated
for 1 with two water molecules is 4.3 kcal/mol, and the
tautomeric form is stable by −24.7 kcal/mol (Table 3 and Figure 4). The activation free energy barrier of the proton transfer
processes assisted by two water molecules for the other systems examined
with the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level is reduced by ∼10
kcal/mol compared to that of the one-water-assisted process (Tables 2 and 3). The significant lowering of the activation free energy
barriers by two water molecules makes the keto–enol tautomerization
process more favorable compared with the water-unassisted and one-water-assisted
tautomerization processes. The activation free energies follow similar
trends as obtained with one water molecule, where 1-2W has the lowest barrier and 5-2W has a barrier higher
than that for other ring systems studied here.

Interestingly, the NICS(1)zz index value (−8.1)
for 1-2W-TS has not been significantly changed compared
to that
of 1-W-TS (−7.6). This result suggests that aromatization
does not influence the two-water-assisted tautomerization process.
However, the activation barrier calculated at the same level of theory
is much lower for 2W-TS compared to that for 1W-TS. The geometrical analyses reveal that while transferring the hydrogen
from the α-carbon center with two water molecules a significant
negative charge develops on this carbon center, which stabilizes the
positive charge developed on the H3O+ fragment
of 1-2W-TS (Figure S4). The ion-pair formation seems to be responsible for the lowering
of the activation barrier with two water molecules compared to that
with the case of one water molecule. Earlier reports on the water-assisted
keto–enol tautomerization process of malonaldehyde also demonstrated
the ion-pair formation in the transition-state structure.38,43

Effect of Solvent Polarity
There are reports that the
dominance of the keto form in polar solvents is observed experimentally
due to the strong solvation effect, whereas in nonpolar solvents,
the tautomeric equilibrium is usually shifted toward the formation
of enol forms.11,24,77,78 Acyclic β-diketones and β-ketoesters
follow Meyer’s rule of a shift in the tautomeric equilibrium
toward the keto tautomer with increasing solvent polarity because
the keto form is more polar than the enol form and hence is more stable
in polar solvents.78 However, a report
on keto–enol tautomerization of some specific Schiff bases
demonstrated an opposite solvent-dependent effect.79 We have extended our computational effort to examine the
impact of solvent polarity on the keto–enol tautomerization
process of the cyclic diketo systems using the SMD solvation model
with acetonitrile (35.7) at M062X-SMDacetonitrile/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
and n-hexane (1.9) at M062X-SMDhexane/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p).
The DFT calculations performed for α- and β-cyclodiones
reveal that the activation free energy barriers increase with the
decreasing solvent polarity. The activation free energy barrier predicted
for cyclopropane-1,2-dione is 54.9 kcal/mol in water, 57.9 kcal/mol
in acetonitrile, and 60.5 kcal/mol in n-hexane. Furthermore,
the stability of the keto–enol form of the three-membered ring
decreases with the decreasing solvent polarity, i.e., the keto–enol
form is more stable in water than in acetonitrile and n-hexane (Table 4).
The keto–enol form of cyclopropane-1,2-dione is stable by 17.9
kcal/mol in water, and the stability decreases to 13.7 kcal/mol in
the acetonitrile solvent and 11.3 kcal/mol in hexane. Furthermore,
the study has been carried out with larger ring systems, and DFT calculations
revealed that the activation energy barrier increases in the less
polar solvent compared to that in the polar solvent (Table 4). Quantum chemical calculations
at the M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory show that the polar solvent
stabilizes the enol form of cyclic systems to a greater extent compared
with the less polar solvents. These results suggest that the keto–enol
tautomeric equilibrium can be altered with cyclic diketones compared
with the acyclic systems using different solvent media.24,78

The importance of dipole moments of keto and enol forms can
govern their stability in different solvent media.78 Therefore, we have also examined the dipole moment of the
studied systems in the gas phase at the M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of
theory (Table S5). The dipole moment calculations
in the gas phase suggest that the keto–enol forms are more
polar than the corresponding diketo forms and hence the propensity
to obtain the former form would be likely with cyclic systems in a
polar solvent system. Nonetheless, the computational results presented
here for the cyclic systems warrant experimental verification.

There are reports available in the literature where water-catalyzed
reactions have been studied in the acetonitrile or a nonpolar solvent
or a mixed interface of two immiscible solvents.37,80−83 Therefore, it is interesting to examine the role of the bulk solvent
in water-assisted keto–enol reactions along with that in the
unassisted reaction. The activation free energy barrier of cyclic-1,2-dione
in the presence of one and two water molecules increases in a nonpolar
solvent, and the keto–enol forms are relatively more stabilized
than the diketo forms (Tables 1, 2, and 4).
1,3-Diketo systems also showed very similar behavior in solvents as
observed with 1,2-diketo systems (Table 4). It is important to note that the keto–enol
tautomerization process largely follows a similar trend in aqueous,
acetonitrile, and n-hexane media and even in the
mixed solvent conditions.

Conclusions
In
this article, we have examined the effect of ring size on the
keto–enol tautomerization process in cyclic-1,2 and 1,3-diketo
systems at the M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory in aqueous medium.
The water-assisted keto-enolization process with one and two water
molecules at the same level of theory was also studied. The computational
studies revealed the following results:

Aromaticity plays an
essential role in the equilibrium process
for the cyclopropane-1,2-dione ring, where the keto–enol form
was favored by 18.2 kcal/mol over the diketo form. The computational
results suggest that the activation free energy is the lowest for
the three-membered ring in the series and hence this ring can be preferred
for the keto–enol tautomerization process. The geometrical
analyses suggest that proton transfer in the larger ring systems is
more facile compared to that in the smaller ring systems.

The
activation free energy barriers calculated for β-cyclodiones
systems follow similar trends; however, the activation free energy
barriers are lower compared to those for the corresponding α-cyclodione
systems. The adjacent carbonyl groups in α-cyclodione systems
experience severe electronic repulsion in the transition states and
hence raise the activation barrier for keto–enol processes
compared to that for the β-cyclodiones. The activation free
energy barriers for the keto–enol tautomerization process for
the α-cyclodiones systems follow the following trend: 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 > 1, and a similar trend was also noticed for the
β-cyclodione
systems. The results of MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
levels of theory further corroborate those calculated at M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) levels of theory.

Water-assisted
keto–enol processes for α- and β-cyclodiones
systems showed a remarkable reduction in the activation free energies
in each case. The activation free energy barrier reduced to 15.2 kcal/mol
for 1-W in the water-assisted process from 54.9 kcal/mol
in the water-unassisted process and 4.3 kcal/mol for 1-2W. The activation free energy barriers for the tautomerization processes
assisted with two water molecules are decreased by ∼10 kcal/mol
due to ion-pair formation in 2W-TSs. Importantly, the
keto–enol process is relatively unfavored for 5-W and 5-2W with the water-assisted processes compared
to that of the water-uncatalyzed system. The water molecules in TS
geometry of 5-W-TS and 5-2W-TS induce ring
strain that caused the ring to be highly distorted and hence increased
the activation free energy barrier. The trend observed for the activation
free energy barrier for the α-cyclodione system is 5-W > 2-W > 4-W > 3-W > 1-W, and β-cyclodione systems also followed
a similar
trend in aqueous medium. The activation free energy barrier for the
two-water-assisted process follows a trend very similar to that observed
for the one-water-assisted process.

The influence of bulk solvent
on the keto–enol tautomerization
process was also examined for cyclic diketo systems in acetonitrile
and hexane solvents. The calculated results suggest the formation
of an enol form in a more polar solvent medium even under mixed solvent
conditions. The dipole moment values govern the stability of cyclic
diketones in different solvent media, and the extent of formation
of keto–enol would be higher with cyclic systems compared to
that with the acyclic ones in a polar solvent. This study sheds light
on the influence of ring size and the solvent polarity on the keto–enol
tautomerization processes that can contribute to design many systems
of biological and chemical interests.

Computational Methods
All of the geometries were optimized using the M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
level of theory in gas phase.84−87 M062X is a hybrid meta exchange-correlation functional
and one of the best functionals to study the organic and biological
small molecules.88 Harmonic frequency calculations
have also been carried to examine the minima of the optimized geometries
with no imaginary frequency. We located the TS structures on the potential
energy surface, and the TSs have been confirmed with one imaginary
frequency. The unscaled and scaled (0.974) harmonic frequencies of
hydroxycyclopropenone and 3-hydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one have been compared
with the experimental reports and also with the computed results.
The M062X/6-31+G(d,p)-calculated vibrational frequencies are in good
agreement with the earlier reports (Table S6).89 Further intrinsic reaction coordinate
(IRC) calculation was performed to connect the reactants, TSs, and
products at the same level of theory.90 We also performed single-point energy calculation using the same
level of theory in three different solvents, i.e., water (ε
= 78.8), acetonitrile (ε = 35.7), and n-hexane
(ε = 1.9), using the SMD solvation model with the self-consistent
reaction field method.91,92 The Gibbs free energy in the
solvent phase has been calculated as 1  where Gaq and Eaq are the
Gibbs free energy and electronic
energy in the aqueous phase, Ggas and Egas are the Gibbs free energy and electronic
energy in the gas phase, ΔG1 atm→1 M is the correction associated with the change in the standard state
from the gas phase (1 atm) to solution (1 mol/L), and its value at
298.15 K is 0.003012 hartree.93−97 The free energy differences were calculated as 2  where ΔG is the free
energy difference, Gx is the energy of
the transition-state geometry or the keto–enol form, and Gdiketo is the free energy of the cyclic diketo
form.

The aqueous phase results calculated using the M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
level of theory have been carefully compared with those calculated
from the MP2/6-311++G(d,p), MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ, MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ, and
MP2/aug-cc-pVQZ methods in the aqueous phase.98,99

Furthermore, we carried out NICS calculations with the GIAO100 method for all of the studied structures at
M062X/6-31+G(d,p) in the aqueous phase.101,102 All of the above density functional calculations were performed
using the Gaussian 09 (G09) software package.103

To explore keto–enol tautomerization of cyclic
diketones,
the computational methods and basis sets have been examined. The DFT
M062X functional and MP2 with Pople-type basis sets and Dunning’s
correlation-consistent basis sets were employed using the M062X/6-31+G(d,p)-optimized
geometry. In this work, we have chosen 6-31+G(d,p) and 6-311++G(d,p)
as Pople basis sets, whereas aug-cc-pVDZ, aug-cc-pVTZ, and aug-cc-pVQZ
as the correlation-consistent basis sets. We have carried out single-point
energy calculations in the aqueous medium using the SMD solvation
model for cyclopropane-1,2-dione (1) as a representative
case to examine the method adopted in this study. The 6-31+G(d,p)
Pople basis set employs 105 basis functions for 1, 134
basis functions for 1-1W, and 163 basis functions for 1-2W, whereas 6-311++G(d,p) uses 124 basis functions for 1, 160 basis functions for 1-1W, and 196 basis
functions for 1-2W. On the other hand, aug-cc-pVDZ employs
133 basis functions for 1 and aug-cc-pVTZ employs 276
basis functions for 1. The aug-cc-pVQZ uses 492 basis
functions for 1, 836 basis functions for 1-2W, and 1524 basis functions for 5-2W. The Dunning correlation-consistent
basis sets have the advantage that they provide a consistent set of
basis sets for extrapolating to the basis set limit; however, the
number of basis functions increases rapidly from double ζ to
quadruple ζ and hence the computational cost. The free energies
calculated for cyclopropane-1,2-dione (1) with M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) and MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p) in the
aqueous phase are similar to those calculated with MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVDZ, MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVTZ, and MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVQZ in the aqueous phase using the geometries optimized
using the M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory (Table 5).

b Optimization of 1, 1-W and 1-2W has been carried out at the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level
of theory.

The free energies
in MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p), MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVDZ,
MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVTZ, and MP2-SMDaq/aug-cc-pVQZ
methods have been calculated using the following
equation 3  where Gaq is the
aqueous phase free energy, Eaq is the
aqueous phase energy, and Gcorrection,gas is the free energy correction value of the gas phase obtained at
the M062X/6-31+G(d,p). The activation free energy barrier and reaction
free energies have been calculated using eq 2.

To examine the influence of solvent
on the geometry and energy,
we have further performed the optimization of three-membered ring
systems (1, 1-W, and 1-2W)
at the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory and compared
the results with the those obtained from single-point aqueous phase
calculations. The free energy values calculated from aqueous phase
optimization are not significantly different (Table 5). The results of the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory show a similar trend as that calculated
with the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) level
of theory. The geometries obtained with M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)
for systems 1, 1-W, and 1-2W are slightly varied from the gas phase optimized geometries (Figure S5). Furthermore, we have also extended
the optimization of the four-membered ring in the aqueous phase with
the M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory, and the results
are in line with the single-point calculated results (Figure S5 and Table S7). In this study, the free
energies for the computed systems were reported with M062X-SMDaq/6-31+G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p) and MP2-SMDaq/6-311++G(d,p)//M062X/6-31+G(d,p)
