The nanotechnology has been applied
recently to increase the efficiency of enhanced oil recovery methods.
The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of SiO2 nanoparticle functionalization with different loadings of
sodium oleate surfactant for polymer flooding processes. The sodium
oleate surfactant was synthesized using oleic acid and NaCl. The SiO2 nanoparticles were functionalized by physical adsorption
using different surfactant loadings of 2.45, 4.08, and 8.31 wt % and
were characterized by thermogravimetric analyses, Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and zeta potential.
Adsorption and desorption experiments of partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide
(HPAM) polymer solutions over the unmodified and surface-modified
nanoparticles were performed, with higher adsorption capacity as the
surfactant loading increases. The adsorption isotherms have a type
III behavior, and polymer desorption from the nanoparticle surface
was considered null. The effect of nanoparticles in the polymer solutions
was evaluated through rheological measurements, interfacial tension
(IFT) tests, contact angle measurements, capillary number, and displacement
tests in a micromodel. The surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticles
showed a slight effect on the viscosity of the polymer solution and
high influence on the IFT reduction and wettability alteration of
the porous medium leading to an increase of the capillary number.
Displacement tests showed that the oil recovery could increase up
to 23 and 77% regarding polymer flooding and water flooding, respectively,
by including the surface-functionalized materials.

1 Introduction
Water
and gas injection processes are widely known and implemented worldwide,
with about 40% of oil being produced through these methods.1 However, the volumetric sweep efficiency of improved
oil recovery processes is limited in cases where the porous medium
evidences high horizontal and vertical heterogeneity, and reservoirs
where the oil viscosity is high. Thus, after a waterflooding process,
over 60% of the original oil in place may remain in the reservoir.2 For this reason, increasing the recovery factor
is required from existing fields through enhanced oil recovery (EOR)
methods that are profitable under the current oil price. Particularly,
the average recovery factor in Colombia is approximately 19%, of which
88% of production comes from primary recovery, 11% due to secondary
recovery, and less than 1% from EOR methods.3 The use of polymer solutions to improve the volumetric sweep efficiency
by lowering the mobility ratio (M) in waterflooding
processes has become standard practice in the operation of various
oilfields.4 However, this technology is
sensitive to different factors such as polymer concentration, type,
and size of the polymer monomer, water salinity, solution pH, and
capillary properties of the rock.5 Polymer
rheological behavior and polymer effect as a relative permeability
modifier on permeability reduction are considered as determining mechanisms
to improve the mobility control and obtain high recovery factors.6−8 Mishra et al.7 examined the hydrolyzed
polyacrylamide (HPAM) adsorption effect on water relative permeability
and original-oil-in-place. A high water permeability reduction in
porous media and oil recovery increase were obtained where the higher
polymer and salt concentration due to electrostatic repulsion forces
with higher polymer adsorption, the thickness of polymer adsorbed
layer, and resistance factors (RF and RRF), especially in acid systems.
Such as is mentioned in above works, when the polymer contacts the
porous medium, part of the polymer is adsorbed on the rock. High values
of polymer adsorbed in the rock cause the increase of both RF and
RRF. Given the hydrophilic character of the polymer, its adsorption
in the rock generates a decrease in the effective permeability of
the water, which corresponds to the residual RF and causes an increase
in the displacement efficiency of the post-polymer water. Also, the
chemical compounds employed in polymer flooding processes are commonly
affected by thermal, chemical, biological, and mechanical degradation
at both surface and reservoir conditions, which hinders the efficiency
of the technique.9 The most widely used
polymer in EOR applications is partially HPAM,10 which is a copolymer of acrylamide and acrylic acid.

Recently, experimental studies of low molecular weight HPAM solutions
with silica nanoparticles showed a decrease in the thermal and chemical
degradation of the polymer solutions while preserving its rheological
properties for an extended period at high temperature.11 Additionally, an increase in the viscosity of
the HPAM solution when adding nanoparticles was observed and was mainly
attributed to the formation of a three-dimensional structure by the
association of hydroxyl groups with polymer chains.12 Saito et al.13 found that when
the silica nanoparticles are added at different concentrations to
the polymer solutions, the viscosity decreases as the nanoparticle
concentration increases until a minimum.

Further, it was concluded
that the concentration effect of silica nanoparticles on the viscosity
behavior is a combination of two different mechanisms, namely, polymer
adsorption over the nanoparticles and polymer flocculation. Sharma
and Sangwai14 investigated the effect of
silica nanoparticles in polymer and polymer/surfactant systems on
the wettability alteration in an EOR process, finding that by adding
10 000 mg/L of the nanoparticles, the viscosity increases at
high temperatures and vice versa. Also, the addition of silica nanoparticles
increases the recovery factor for the polymer/surfactant system compared
to the polymer system because of a change from intermediate wettability
to a strong water-wet system.

Hu et al.12 found that the addition of silica nanoparticles to HPAM solutions
improves the viscoelastic properties of the polymeric solution at
high temperature and salinity conditions. The results showed that
after 12 days at 80 °C, the polymer stability and viscosity increase
with the addition of 8000 mg/L nanoparticles. The results were linked
to the cross-linking of polymer chains and an increase in the viscoelasticity
by the interaction of silanol groups and carbonyl groups of HPAM through
hydrogen bonds. Ahmadi et al.15 investigated
the effect of hydrophobic silica nanoparticles in the interfacial
tension behavior for water injection applications in carbonate systems.
Results showed that the employed silica nanoparticles (up to 10 000
mg/L) could improve the oil recovery, decrease the mobility ratio,
and reduce the interfacial tension (IFT).

The effect of silica
nanoparticles in EOR processes can be improved by surface modification
with surfactants and polymers to increase dispersion, changing its
wettability nature, generate polymer nucleation centers, and enhance
viscoelastic properties.12,16−18 Other studies report the silica nanoparticle effect in the aqueous
phase with polymers and surfactants to improve their viscous, interfacial,
and capillary performance in EOR applications.19−27 Hence, it has been reported that using surfactants for modifying
the nanoparticle surface from hydrophilic to hydrophobic can improve
the interaction with the polymers.17,28,29 Zheng et al.17 evaluated
hexamethyldisilazane (HMDS)- and hexadeciltrimethoxysilane-functionalized
silica nanoparticles for enhancing the HPAM viscosity at high temperature.
The length of polymer chains was identified as a key viscosity factor
because of the formation of microzones of hydrophobic associations
in the aqueous phase, related to the adhering of functional groups
to the nanoparticle surface as hydrogen bonds, and the action of the
hydrophobic groups of the nanoparticle and polymer. Under dynamic
conditions, an oil recovery up to 10.5% can be obtained with 0.6 pore
volumes (PVs) of a solution with 20 000 mg/L HMDS-modified
silica nanoparticles and was mainly attributed to an increase in the
viscosity of the displacement fluid. Corredor-Rojas et al.30 investigated the effect of surface modification
of silica nanoparticles with carboxylic acid and silane groups (3-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,
octyltriethoxysilane, and oleic acid) on the viscosity of HPAM and
xanthan gum solutions at different nanoparticle concentrations and
temperatures. Results showed that the modified silica nanoparticles
improve the tolerance to high temperatures and ion degradation and
increase the solution viscosity because of the generation of three-dimensional
networks between the nanoparticles and polymer chains.

Further,
other chemical agents can also be employed for nanoparticle modification
such as sodium dodecyl sulfate, hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide,
and coupling agents.31−33 Particularly, sodium oleate could be attractive for
improving the performance of polymer systems regarding viscosity and
other rheological properties.16 The polymer—sodium
oleate synergy lies in the polymer unraveling because of the repulsion
forces between the anionic groups of both polymer and surfactant.16 Hence, the interaction between polymer and sodium
oleate clusters could improve the system viscosity, decreases the
IFT, and enhances the oil mobility ratio with less polymer dosage.

However, in the scientific literature, there are no studies reporting
the surface modification of silica nanoparticles with sodium oleate
for improving polymer flooding processes. Therefore, the primary objective
of this study is to evaluate the effect of sodium oleate concentration
grafted onto silica nanoparticles to low molecular weight HPAM solutions
in deionized water. The sodium oleate was grafted over the nanoparticle
surface by the interaction between the adsorbate/adsorbent based on
the adsorption phenomena. Adsorption isotherms, rheological behavior,
contact angle measurements, and IFT tests were carried out. Also,
displacement tests were performed in a quarter five-spot pattern micromodel
to evaluate the oil recovery after polymer flooding in the absence
and presence of silica and sodium oleate-modified silica nanoparticles.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Characterization of Sodium
Oleate Surfactant
The synthesized sodium oleate surfactant
was characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy,
critical micelle concentration (CMC), and hydrophilic–lipophilic
balance (HLB). Figure 1 shows the FTIR spectrum for the synthesized sodium oleate and its
comparison with the one reported by Jin et al.34 It can be observed from Figure 1 that both spectra show similar bands and
intensities, which confirms that the synthesized compound is the sodium
oleate surfactant. The compound shows bands at 1563 and 1444 cm–1, attributed to vibrations of carboxylic groups (−COOH)
of the oleic acid. The characteristic bands at 3430 and 3420 cm–1 correspond to C–H stretching and −NH2 groups, respectively. Bands at 2881 and 2834 cm–1 are associated with vibrations of C–H, and bands at 746 and
729 cm–1 are characteristic of hydroxyl groups and
stretching and deformation of −CH2.34−37

one reported by Jin et al.34

Panels (a and b) of Figure 2 show the CMC of sodium oleate surfactant
in the aqueous phase as estimated by (a) absorbance and (b) surface
tension measurements, respectively. The CMC is determined by a change
in the linear trend of each measurement. From Figure 2, it can be observed that the CMC has values
of 912 ± 2 mg/L as determined by both surface tension and absorbance
measurements and is in agreement with the values reported in the literature.38,39 The HLB of the surfactant was estimated at a value of 12 according
to the procedure proposed by Chun and Martin,40 indicating an oil/water emulsion stabilizer or solubilizer agent
behavior.41,42

determined by a change in the linear trend of each measurement and
is estimated at 912 ± 2 mg/L.

2.2 Nanoparticle Characterization
The
modification of the SiO2 nanoparticle surface with the
sodium oleate surfactant is performed to enhance the adsorption and
dispersion of the nanomaterial in the matrix of the polymer solution.
Functional groups of the employed partially HPAM where characterized
by FTIR analyses as reported by Giraldo et al.,11 observing OH– groups, =CH bonds, C–N
nitrile bonds, as well as N–O bonds of nitrile groups, alkanes,
and aliphatic amines. Further, interactions between hydroxyl, carboxyl,
and nitro groups from sodium oleate and polymer chains can be determinant
in the structure and matrix behavior of HPAM. Figure 3 shows a schematic representation of the
interaction between the SiO2 nanoparticles and the sodium
oleate, where hydroxyl bonds and oxygen groups from sodium oleate
are linked with Si–OH groups in the nanoparticle.

Figure 3 Schematic illustration
of the interaction of hydroxyl bonds and oxygen groups from sodium
oleate linked with Si–OH groups on the SiO2 nanoparticles.

The SiO2 nanoparticles
have a surface area of 380 m2/g and mean particle size
of 11 nm according to the dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements.
The SiO2 support was previously characterized43 through field emission scanning electron microscopy
using a JSM-6701F microscope (JEOL, Japan), observing spherical particles
with a mean particle size of 9 nm, which is in agreement with the
DLS results. SiO2 nanoparticles were functionalized with
the sodium oleate solutions at surfactant concentrations of 9.0, 4.0,
and 2.5% regarding the mass of nanoparticles. Table 1 shows the mean particle diameter (dP50), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET)
surface area, amount of grafted surfactant, and zeta potential of
the selected nanoparticles. The amount of grafted surfactant was estimated
through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) under an air flow. As seen
in Table 1, percentages
of anchored surfactant higher than 2 wt % were obtained through the
incipient wetness technique. Further, the nanomaterials were named
SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8 according to the amount of anchored surfactant.
It is worth to mention that the grafted surfactant onto the nanoparticles
does not leach to the polymer solution as confirmed through UV–vis
spectroscopy. It can be observed from Table 1 that the modified nanoparticles show larger
particle sizes than unmodified SiO2 nanoparticles. These
results confirm that the sodium oleate surfactant adheres to the surface
of the nanoparticles and hence increases the surface energy which
promotes the aggregation phenomenon. Also, it was observed that the
surfactant grafted on the SiO2 nanoparticles reduces the
surface area (SBET) as some of the micropores
can be hindered.44−46

SiO2	0	11	380	–22.33	
SNP-2	2.45	63.6	177.6	–31.45	
SNP-4	4.08	89.3	161.5	–42.21	
SNP-8	8.31	90.7	146.7	–57.91	
The electrokinetic potential for all nanoparticle
dispersion in water shows a strong charge surface variation. The zeta
potential of the system indicates the stability of nanoparticle dispersion
and their degree of electrostatic repulsion. For modified silica nanoparticles
(SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8), a high zeta potential value is obtained
in comparison with unmodified SiO2 nanoparticles and is
due to high ionic concentration or negative charges on the surface.36 Therefore, a high dispersion and interaction
between polymer chains with free bonds in the nanoparticle surface
can avoid nanoparticle aggregation.47,48

Figure 4 shows the FTIR spectrum
of the SiO2, SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8 nanoparticles. For
the SiO2 nanoparticles, characteristic bands are observed
such as 3700 and 3410 cm–1 corresponding to Si–OH
and Si–O–H groups, respectively, 2250 cm–1 band corresponding to the Si–H group, and bands between 1750
and 1700 cm–1 corresponding to H2O groups.
The bands at 1040, 1100, and 1550 cm–1 correspond
to Si–OH, Si–O, and H2O groups, respectively.

Figure 4 FTIR spectrum
of SiO2 nanoparticles and sodium oleate-functionalized
nanoparticles with 2.45 (SNP-2), 4.08 (SNP-4), and 8.31 wt % (SNP-8)
of sodium oleate.

Also, functional groups
represented by the bands 950 and 870 cm–1 corresponding
to Si–H and O–H can be observed, respectively. Nanoparticles
with sodium oleate show characteristic bands of surfactant at 1560
and 1483 cm–1 attributed to vibrations of COO– groups.34 Other bands are
those for the hydrocarbon chains and carbonyl groups at 2976, 2918,
and 2854 cm–1 representative of C=O and carboxylic
salt, whereas bands between 1554 and 900 cm–1 correspond
to C–H and C–C, respectively.49 However, after surfactant impregnation, the band of 3700 cm–1 corresponding to the Si–OH group is still
present concerning the exposed surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles.
This is consistent with that reported by Hu et al.12 that confirmed from the FTIR analysis that the formation
of hydrogen bonds contributes to a high interaction between HPAM groups
as carbonyl groups (C=O, C–H, and C–O) and groups
on surface silica such as silanol groups (Si–O–Si bending
and stretching).50

2.3 Adsorption
Test
To obtain the adsorption isotherms, the polymer concentration
was fixed in 500 mg/L based on polymer flooding applications according
to previous studies.11 The nanoparticle
dosages were 300, 500, 1000, 3000, and 5000 mg/L. Figure 5 shows the adsorption isotherms
of polymer on the silica nanoparticles (modified and the support)
together with the solid–liquid equilibrium (SLE) model fitting
at 25 °C. The adsorption isotherms have a type III behavior,
where the adsorption is inversely proportional to the concentration
of nanoparticles. Modified nanoparticles with the surfactant adsorbed
more HPAM polymer than the support. The trend based on the uptake
of polymer for the nanoparticles was the following SNP-8 > SNP-4
> SNP-2 ≈ SiO2 within the whole range of concentrations
evaluated. At a polymer equilibrium concentration of 487 mg/L, the
SNP-8 adsorbed 0.17 mg/m2 sodium oleate, whereas the support
(SiO2) adsorbed 0.064 mg/m2. Also, from Figure 5, it is possible
to conclude that the four nanoparticles evaluated adsorb polymer because
of the intermolecular forces between the most polar components of
HPAM polymer and the sodium oleate grafted onto silica nanoparticles.16 Some functional groups of sodium oleate over
silica nanoparticle surface enhance the interaction between OH–
bonds and oxygen groups in the polymer.29,50 The results
obtained in the polymer desorption process showed that the silica
nanoparticles modified and unmodified with the surfactant at the different
concentrations are null. The obtained SLE model parameters such as H, K, and Nads,m are summarized in Table 2. These parameters indicate affinity and self-association
ability of the polymer on the nanoparticles; the goodness-of-fit is
confirmed by root-mean-square error (RSME %) values lower than 1.0%.
SLE parameters indicate a higher affinity (H), more
ability to self-association (K), and higher polymer
adsorbed (Nads,m) as the surfactant loading
increases on the SiO2 nanoparticle because of a synergistic
effect between polymer chains and polar groups from sodium oleate.

2.4 Rheological
Behavior of Polymer Solutions in the Presence of Nanoparticles
The selection of commercial polymer concentration (500 mg/L) was
based on a previous study11 where a viscosity
of 69 cP (7.1 s–1 at 25 °C) with 500 mg/L polymer
and 3000 mg/L silica nanoparticles (SiO2) was observed,
showing a better viscous and degradation behavior in oxidizing atmosphere
and high temperature regarding the polymer solution in the absence
of SiO2 nanoparticles. Also, previous results show that
the rheological behavior of the polymer dispersion does not change
with the inclusion at low concentrations of nanoparticles (<3000
mg/L) and the pseudoplastic behavior remains due to the cross-linking
effect between silica nanoparticles and polymer.11 In Figure 6, the rheological behavior of the polymer solution with (a) SNP-2,
(b) SNP-4, and (c) SNP-8 nanoparticles at different dosages as a function
of the shear rate at 25 °C is showed. The results show that for
the three nanoparticles evaluated at concentrations of 500 and 1000
mg/L, the viscosity is not drastically affected regarding the polymer
system in the absence of nanoparticles. Nevertheless, for 2000 and
3000 mg/L and shear rate values <100 s–1, the
viscosity decreases and could be related to the high polymer uptake
that inhibits the formation of the 3D network.

of the partially HPAM solutions at 500 mg/L in deionized water in
the presence of sodium oleate-functionalized nanoparticles (a) SNP-2,
(b) SNP-4, and (c) SNP-8 at 25 °C.

Table 3 summarizes
the obtained parameters of the Carreau model for the rheological behavior
of the polymer solution at different concentrations of the selected
nanoparticles at 25 °C. It can be seen that the parameters are
in agreement with the trend observed in Figure 6, where the relaxation time (λ) and
the pseudoplasticity index (N) decrease with the
addition of nanoparticles in the polymer network structure in comparison
with the system in the absence of nanoparticles. The parameters of
the Carreau model represent the viscous behavior of the polymer–nanoparticle
system with the application of shear rate using four parameters as
flow index (N) where values <1 that indicate a
polymeric suspension with pseudoplastic behavior and the relaxation
time λ that indicate the system reset after perturbation where
shorter times suggest a faster system restoration.

According
to Das et al.,16 zeta potential values
indicate high repulsion forces in a system with the addition of SNP-8
nanoparticles, which makes the polymer in solution more elongated
and less susceptible to degradation. Figure 7 shows a schematic illustration of the HPAM
and SNP-8 nanoparticle interaction. It is expected that the modified
nanoparticles form hydrophobic zones because of the hydrophobic chains
of surfactant that associates with polymer chains and other nanoparticles
to build a 3D micelle structure in the polymer matrix.29,50 The sodium oleate action on the nanoparticle surface leads to high
interaction between the polymer and surfactant despite the negative
charges.16,51 Also, degradation can be inhibited because
of the adsorption process as the functional groups in the polymer
system that are prone to degradation are interacting with the selected
nanoparticles.11 Hence, according to the
results in Figure 6 and Table 3, a nanoparticle
concentration of 1000 mg/L was selected for contact angle measurements
and IFT tests.

Figure 7 Schematic illustration of the partially HPAM interaction
with sodium oleate-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles. High
repulsion forces in a system with the addition of functionalized nanoparticles
make the polymer in solution more elongated and less susceptible to
degradation.

2.5 Interfacial
Tension Measurements
Interfacial tensions (IFTs) were measured
for the HPAM solutions/crude oil systems in the presence and absence
of SiO2, SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8 nanoparticles at 25 °C
and are summarized in Table 4. The IFT increases 22.7% with the addition of the polymer
in the aqueous phase in comparison with the base system (water/crude
oil) and decreases with the SiO2 nanoparticle addition
of 11.8%. The effect of SiO2 nanoparticles on interfacial
tension is in agreement with those reported in the specialized literature.52 For SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8, 16, 20, and 43%
of IFT reduction are observed regarding the HPAM solutions/crude oil
system in the absence of nanoparticles. IFT reduction with nanoparticle
inclusion could be due to repulsive electrostatic forces between polymer
and sodium oleate-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles that
contribute to the rapid diffusion of the nanoparticles in the polymer
solution to the oil–aqueous phase interface. Further, it can
be inferred that the surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticles
can act as a carrier of the sodium oleate surfactant.53 It is worth to mention that the sodium oleate anchored
onto nanoparticles was not desorbed to the polymer solution.

2.6 Contact
Angle Measurement
Figure 8 shows the contact angle of oil and water for restored
samples before and after contact with HPAM solutions in the presence
and absence of SiO2 nanoparticles and oleate-functionalized
SiO2 nanoparticles at 25 °C. It can be observed from Figure 8 that the samples
are initially oil-wet with contact angles for oil and water of 1°
and 86°, respectively. After contact with the polymer solution
in the absence of nanoparticles, the system changes from a strong
oil-wet condition to an intermediate wettability. This could be due
to the low influence of the trapped polymer without removing nonpolar
fractions from the rock surface causing a slight wettability alteration.
When the polymer concentration increases in the aqueous phase, the
displacement phase viscosity considerably increases and maintains
the mobility control and rheological performance in the porous medium.
Nevertheless, an excess of the polymer in the solution increases the
probability of adsorption onto the porous medium and other associated
formation damage6,8 because of a high interaction
between polymer molecules and rock surface as a consequence of electrostatic
and repulsion forces, especially in an acid system when polymer adsorption
on the sand surface is high.7

Figure 8 Contact angle
images of oil and water for restored samples before and after contact
with HPAM solutions in the presence and absence of SiO2 nanoparticles and sodium oleate-functionalized SiO2 nanoparticles
at 25 °C. The water droplets are evaluated in the restored samples
(a) before treatment, (b) after contact with HPAM solution, and after
contact with HPAM solution in the presence of (c) SiO2,
(d) SNP-2, (e) SNP-4, and (f) SNP-8 nanoparticles. The oil droplets
are evaluated in the restored sample (g) before treatment, (h) after
contact with HPAM solution, and after contact with HPAM solution in
the presence of (i) SiO2, (j) SNP-2, (k) SNP-4, and (l)
SNP-8 nanoparticles. HPAM concentration was fixed at 500 mg/L, and
the nanoparticle concentration was 1000 mg/L.

After the inclusion of the nanoparticles, the preference
for the water phase increases as the sodium oleate loading over the
SiO2 support increases. Additionally, the contact angle
of oil increases on the order SNP-8 > SNP-4 > SNP-2 ≈
SiO2 nanoparticles, indicating that the functionalized
materials lead to less affinity for the oil phase. This behavior could
be due to film deposition of nanoparticles and their distribution
over the rock surface,54 nanoparticle adsorption,
and change in free surface energy toward the water-wet surface.55

2.7 Capillary Number Estimation
For determining the viscous/interfacial force ratio in the system,
the capillary number was estimated considering the polymer viscosity,
wettability alteration, interfacial tension, and an aqueous fluid
velocity at 7.1 s–1 and 0.0835 cm·s–1 representative for field applications (10–2 to
101 s–1).56Figure 9 shows the
behavior of the capillary number for an oil-wet surface before and
after polymer contact in the absence and presence of SiO2 and SiO2-modified with surfactant (SNP-2, SNP-4, and
SNP-8) at 25 °C. Capillary numbers of about 10–5 indicate an oil-wet state.57,58 Nanoparticle addition
to the polymer solutions increases the capillary number regarding
the system in the absence of nanoparticles. The best performance was
obtained with surface-modified nanoparticles, reaching values up to
10–2. Polymer flooding (NC ≈ 2 × 10–3)59 contributes mainly to the viscosity of the displacing fluid and
slightly to wettability alteration. However, silica nanoparticles
(SiO2) contribute to fluid viscosity and wettability alteration,
increasing the capillary number a 62.4%. In the case of functionalized
nanoparticles, a significant contribution in the IFT reduction as
a function of the surfactant loading on the nanoparticle surface leads
to an increase in the capillary number in 65.7, 72.2, and 91.2%, for
SNP-2, SNP-4, and SNP-8 materials, respectively. Reduction in the
interfacial forces in the solid–water–oil system can
be explained by Young’s law55 that
states an interfacial force ratio between contact angle and interfacial
tension of oil–water–solid in a thermodynamic equilibrium
system. Accordingly, the aqueous contact angle reduction in the oil-wet
surface is a consequence of the IFT reduction in the presence of nanoparticles
that may lead to the high recovery of trapped oil because of the reduction
of energy needed to mobilize the oil droplets in the porous medium.60

Figure 9 Capillary number for an oil-wet surface before and after
polymer treatment with 3000 mg/L of SiO2 nanoparticles
and 1000 mg/L of surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticles (SNP-2,
SNP-4, and SNP-8) at 25 °C.

Further, on the basis of the adsorption tests, rheological
measurements, interfacial tension, contact angle, and capillary number
results, the SiO2 and SNP-8 nanoparticles were selected
for the displacement tests.

2.8 Displacement Tests
Figure 10 shows the
oil recovery in a quarter five-spot pattern micromodel for the injection
of water, followed by the injection of HPAM solutions in the presence
and absence of 3000 mg/L of SiO2 nanoparticles or 1000
mg/L of SNP-8 nanoparticles at 25 °C. It can be observed that
after water injection, an oil recovery of about 51% is obtained for
the three systems evaluated, which confirms the reproducibility of
the displacement tests and is in agreement with previous results.19,21,22,61 After polymer injection, 63% of oil is recovered from the micromodel,
indicating an additional 24% of oil recovery. It can be observed that
the oil recovery curve with polymer injection is concave upward, suggesting
that for the initial PV injected (PVI), the polymer may be adsorbed
over the porous medium.62 Regarding the
polymer solutions in the presence of nanoparticles, for the first
PVI, the oil recovery is similar for both SiO2 and SNP-8
nanoparticles with a higher slope than the one for polymer flooding
in the absence of the nanomaterials. This slope change could be due
to the inhibition of the retention of the polymer over the rock surface
as the functional groups in the polymer chain that interact with the
porous media are already interacting with the nanoparticle surface.
The values of polymer adsorption onto rock and nanoparticle surface
are 6 μg/g as reported previously19,61 and 17 mg/g,
respectively, indicating that the polymer has higher selectivity for
the nanomaterials because of the interactions between the adsorbate
and adsorbent. This is in agreement with the retention values (adsorption
and mechanical blockage) of 59.8 and 34.9 μg/g for the polymer
in the absence and presence of nanoparticles, respectively, indicating
a decrease in polymer retention of 41.7% with the addition of SiO2 nanoparticles.19 The final oil
recovery with SiO2 and SNP-8 nanoparticles was 61 and 77%
higher than the waterflooding, respectively. Higher recovery with
the functionalized nanoparticles could be due to the IFT reduction
and the wettability alteration as a consequence of the grafted sodium
oleate surfactant. From the displacement tests, it can be concluded
that higher recovery can be obtained with lower dosages of sodium
oleate-functionalized nanoparticles in comparison to SiO2 nanoparticles.

Figure 10 Oil recovery in a quarter five-spot pattern micromodel
for the injection of water, followed by the injection of HPAM solutions
in the presence and absence of SiO2 (3000 mg/L), and SNP-8
nanoparticles (1000 mg/L) at 25 °C.

3 Conclusions
SiO2 nanoparticles
were functionalized with different loadings of sodium oleate surfactant
to increase the efficiency of polymer flooding processes with partially
HPAM. The surfactant–nanoparticle interaction could be ruled
by hydroxyl bonds and oxygen groups from sodium oleate that are linked
with Si–OH groups in the nanoparticle. TGA experiments showed
that nanoparticles with surfactant loadings of 2.45, 4.08, and 8.31
wt % were obtained through physical adsorption. The functionalized
nanoparticles can adsorb the HPAM from the solution, with higher adsorption
for nanoparticles with higher surfactant loading. For the selected
nanoparticles at concentrations of 500 and 1000 mg/L, the viscosity
was not drastically affected regarding the polymer system in the absence
of nanoparticles.

Nevertheless, the synthesized materials reduced
the IFT and changed the wettability of the porous medium from an oil-wet
state to a water-wet state, leading to an increase of the capillary
number. The oil recovery in a quarter five-spot pattern micromodel
was 61 and 77% higher than the waterflooding and 12 and 23% higher
than polymer flooding, for systems in the presence of 3000 mg/L of
SiO2 nanoparticles and 1000 mg/L SNP-8 nanoparticles, respectively.
IFT reduction, wettability changes, and inhibition of polymer adsorption
over the porous medium were identified as the main mechanisms for
oil recovery enhancement in the presence of functionalized nanoparticles.
Hence, it can be concluded that the nanoparticle functionalization
improves the effect of the nanomaterial in the oil recovery with a
lower dosage, which can lead to optimized EOR operations and cost
savings.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
The polymer employed was a commercial partially HPAM provided by
SNF Floerger (Andrézieux, France) with molecular weight and
degree of hydrolysis of 6–8 MDa and 30%, respectively. Commercial
SiO2 nanoparticles were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St.
Louis, MO, USA). Oleic acid (≥99%), sodium hydroxide pellets
(97%), and ethanol (99.5%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis,
MO, USA) and were employed for the synthesis of the sodium oleate
surfactant. Potassium bromide (PIKE Technologies, Inc., USA) was used
for FTIR analysis. An extra heavy crude oil of 7° API was used
for wettability restoration of the cores to an oil-wet state. Colombian
crude oil of 20° API was used for the contact angle measurements
and coreflooding tests. For the displacement tests, clean silica sand
(Ottawa sand, US sieves 50/60 mesh) was used for the preparation of
the porous medium and was purchased from Minercol S.A. (Colombia).
Additionally, deionized water was used as a solvent for preparing
different solutions used in this research. Toluene (99.8%), methanol
(99.8%), and HCl (37%) were obtained from Panreac (Barcelona, Spain)
and were employed for porous media cleaning.

4.2 Methods
4.2.1 Synthesis and Characterization of Sodium Oleate Surfactant
For the synthesis of sodium oleate, a solution of 5 wt % NaOH in
deionized water is added to a 15 v/v % solution of oleic acid in ethanol
under constant stirring at 25 °C up to the solution reaches a
pH value of 7, indicating that oleic acid reacted with NaOH and the
sodium oleate is obtained.33,63,64 The sodium oleate was characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, surface
tension, and absorbance for determining the CMC and was compared with
literature results.63 The hydrophobic–lipophilic
balance (HLB) was determined by measuring the IFT at 25 °C of
a 1000 mg/L solution of sodium oleate surfactant in deionized water
(pH ≈ 7.1) as an aqueous phase and toluene as the oil phase.40 The linear equation for determining the HLB
value from the least square of different commercial surfactants evaluated
is showed in eq 1 as
reported by Chun and Martin40 1  

4.2.2 Surface Modification of SiO2 Nanoparticles
The surface of the SiO2 nanoparticles was modified with
the synthesized sodium oleate surfactant through the incipient wetness
method46 considering different stock solutions
with surfactant concentrations of 9.0, 4.0, and 2.5% regarding the
mass of nanoparticles. After impregnation, the modified nanoparticles
were washed with deionized water in excess. The absorbance of the
effluent water was followed by UV–vis spectrophotometry using
a 60S UV–Visible Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
MA, USA) until the absorbance was the same as before washing. The
nanoparticles were separated by centrifugation using a Hermle Universal
Centrifuge Z360 (Hermle Labortechnik GmbH, Wehingen, DEU). Surface-modified
SiO2 nanoparticles (SNP-Y) will be named
according to the amount Y of surfactant grafted on
the surface. For instance, the SNP-2 material is composed of SiO2 nanoparticles with 2.4 wt % sodium oleate on the surface.

4.2.3 Characterization of Surface-Modified SiO2 Nanoparticles
The amount of surfactant remaining on the
nanoparticle surface was determined using a Q50 thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA Instruments, Inc., New Castle, DE) under air injection
with a heating rate of 5 °C/min up to 800 °C. The surface
area (SBET) of nanoparticles was estimated
by nitrogen physisorption at −149 °C using a Gemini VII
2390 Surface Area Analyzer (Micromeritics, GA, United States). The SBET values were determined following the BET
method.65

The hydrodynamic diameter
of the nanoparticles was obtained by DLS measurements using a NanoPlus-3
(Micromeritics, USA) after sonication for 6 h at 25 °C. The zeta
potential was determined by electrophoretic light scattering to determine
the dispersion of nanoparticles in the aqueous phase using the NanoPlus-3
(Micromeritics, USA).66,67

Functional groups over
the surface of the nanomaterials were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy
with an IRAffinity spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan). Each sample
was diluted with KBr at a 1:3 mass ratio. For sample detection, a
KCl cell with a 0.25 mm spacing was used and placed in the FTIR at
25 °C with 20 sweeps per minute for each sample in a range of
4000 to 500 cm–1 at a resolution of 2 cm–1.

4.2.4 Preparation of Polymer Solutions
Eight Polymer solutions at a fixed concentration of 500 mg/L were
prepared according to the API-RP-6368 method
by dilution from a 2000 mg/L polymer stock solution based on the results
obtained in a previous study.11

4.2.5 Adsorption Tests
Adsorption tests of polymer onto the
evaluated nanoparticles were performed in batch–mode experiments11,69 at 25 °C by fixing the amount of the polymer (500 mg/L) and
varying the dosage of the nanoparticles with and without surface modification
in 300, 500, 1000, 3000, and 5000 mg/L. Solutions were kept under
constant stirring at 500 rpm for 48 h. Further, the nanoparticles
containing the adsorbed polymer are recovered by centrifugation using
a Hermle Universal Centrifuge Z360 (Hermle Labortechnik GmbH, Wehingen,
DEU). The amount adsorbed (NADS) in mg/m2 is estimated by mass balance using the Q50 thermogravimetric
analyzer (TA Instruments, Inc., New Castle, DE) under a dry air flow
at 100 mL/min and a constant heating rate of 20 °C/min from 25
to 800 °C. TGA are conducted for nanomaterials with and without
adsorbed polymer. For desorption tests, the nanoparticles containing
the adsorbed polymer are washed with deionized water and the absorbance
of the effluent is followed until reaching the same value than that
of the deionized water before washing. Further, samples are placed
in clean deionized water under the same ratios of solution volume
to the mass of nanoparticles employed in the adsorption experiments
and kept under low stirring for 48 h. The samples are then centrifuged,
and the desorbed polymer was determined by TGA.11

4.2.6 Rheological Tests
Rheological measurements for polymer solutions in the absence and
presence of nanoparticles were performed using a rotating rheometer
Kinexus Pro+ (Malvern Instruments, Worcestershire—UK) with
the concentric cylinder geometry, equipped with a Peltier cylinder
cartridge for temperature control. Each measurement was performed
at 25 °C in a range of shear rate of 5 and 250 s–1.

4.2.7 Interfacial Tension Measurements
Interfacial tension (IFT) measurements were carried out with a GmbH
K20 digital tensiometer (KRÜSS, Germany) using a Du Noüy
ring70 composed of platinum-iridium that
is suspended from a force sensor. The instrument is first calibrated
with a patron (water ∼72 mN/m ± 2). The oil/polymer solution
system is equilibrated for 24 h before measurement.

4.2.8 Wettability Tests
Contact angle measurements were performed
to observe wettability alterations after contact with polymer solutions
in the absence and presence of nanoparticles. The rock samples with
a diameter of 3.8 cm and a length of 4.83 cm were obtained from an
outcrop sandstone and cleaned with toluene and methanol to remove
impurities. After cleaning, the samples were dried at 70 °C for
48 h. The rock samples were originally water-wet and were restored
to an oil-wet state by aging with a crude oil based on the method
reported in previous studies.71,72 The restored samples
(oil-wet) were used in the contact angle measurements as a baseline.
The treatment with polymer solutions in the absence and presence of
nanoparticles consists in soaking the oil-wet rock in each solution
under constant stirring at 500 rpm for 48 h at 70 °C. Further,
the treated samples are removed from the solution and dried for 24
h at 70 °C. The contact angle is measured in liquid (water and
crude oil)/air/rock systems at 25 °C by placing a drop of each
fluid on the rock surface. A photograph of each drop is taken using
a digital camera at a distance of 50 mm from the sample.73 The contact angle was estimated using the LayOut
software (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) and fitting the drop profile
using sphere- or ellipse-like shapes.28

4.2.9 Capillary Number Estimation
The
capillary number (NC) is calculated according
to eq 2 for evaluating
the relation between viscous and interfacial forces in the system
for having a better insight into the recovery efficiency for the different
scenarios evaluated74 2  where v (cm/s) and μ (poise) are the velocity
and viscosity of the displacement fluid, respectively. σ (mN/m)
is the interfacial tension, and θ is the measured contact angle
over the rock surface.

4.2.10 Displacement Tests in
a Quarter Five-Spot Pattern Micromodel
The potential for
enhancing the oil recovery with polymeric solutions in the presence
and absence of nanoparticles was evaluated in a radial flow cell packed
with Ottawa sand emulating a quarter five-spot pattern. For this,
three recovery technologies were considered, namely: (i) a 500 mg/L
polymer solution in the absence of nanoparticles, (ii) a 500 mg/L
polymer solution with SiO2 nanoparticles at 3000 mg/L according
to previous studies,75 and (iii) a 500
mg/L polymer solution with surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticles.
The surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticle concentration is
selected based on the adsorption tests, rheological measurements,
interfacial tension, contact angle, and capillary number results.
The working fluids are a light crude oil of 20 °API and a 5 wt
% KCl brine. An Ottawa sand US sieves 50/60 mesh was employed for
porous medium preparation. Petrophysical properties such as porosity,
as well as water and oil effective permeabilities, were estimated
in 26%, and 530 and 225 mD, respectively. HCl, toluene, and methanol
were employed for cleaning the sand and further dried at 120 °C
according to the procedure described in previous studies.62,76 First, the cell is saturated with brine at an injection rate of
2 mL/min. Then, oil is injected to the micromodel at 2 mL/min until
the residual water saturation (Swr) conditions
are reached. At this point, waterflooding is carried out by injecting
brine until no more oil is recovered at about 1.5 PVI. The next step
is the injection of given PV of the chemical treatment, that is, a
500 mg/L polymer solution, a nanofluid containing 500 mg/L polymer
and 3000 mg/L SiO2 nanoparticles, and a nanofluid containing
500 mg/L polymer and 1000 mg/L surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticles
at an injection rate of 0.15 mL/min. The SiO2 nanoparticle
and surface-modified SiO2 nanoparticle dosages were selected
according to previous studies75 and according
to the capillary number results, respectively. Finally, brine is injected
again to guarantee that no more oil is recovered. In all tests, the
produced volumes of oil are monitored. All of the dynamic tests were
performed in a radial flow cell that emulates an array of producer—injector
wells (Figure 11).

Figure 11 Experimental
setup for the displacement tests. The cell emulates a quarter five-spot
pattern of the injector well to the producer well. The porous media
are composed of 50/60 sieve Ottawa sand. The dimensions of the cell
are 25 cm × 12 cm × 2 cm. Temperature: 25 °C.

5 Modeling
5.1 Adsorption Isotherms: the SLE Model
The SLE model is
based on the theory of adsorption of self-associative molecules such
as polymers over the nanoparticles surface and is expressed as follows77,78 3  where, 4   5  Nads (mg/m2) is the amount of polymer
adsorbed onto the nanoparticle surface, Nads,m (mg/m2) is the maximum adsorption capacity of the nanoparticles
under the range of concentration evaluated, and CE (mg/g) is the equilibrium concentration of polymer in
the liquid phase. The SLE parameters K (g/g) and H (mg/g) are the adsorption constants related to the polymer
self-association coefficient, and the affinity of the polymer get
adsorbed on the nanoparticles surface, respectively.78

5.2 Rheological Behavior
The Carreau model79 introduces rheological
parameters such as relaxation time (λc), related
to the time for the polymer system return to equilibrium in response
to a disturbance, and viscosity parameters (μ0,γ and μ∞,γ) that indicate the fluid
behavior at zero and infinite stress. The Carreau model is expressed
as follows79 6  where μ (cP) and γ (s–1) are the viscosity and shear rate, respectively.

The root-mean-square
error (RSME %) was used to estimate the goodness of fit of the employed
models.80,81
