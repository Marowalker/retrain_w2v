In this work, Ru-doped
nickel ferrites (NiFe2O4) were synthesized by
a chemical co-precipitation method. Subsequently,
they were annealed at different temperatures. The crystallinity of
the samples was evaluated using X-ray diffraction and the morphology
of the samples was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and
transmission electron microscopy. Dielectric constants and dielectric
loss were studied. Ru-doped nickel ferrite samples showed relatively
low dielectric constant and loss. Also, the dielectric constant and
loss decreased with increasing annealing temperature. Vibrational
sample magnetometer analysis shows the hysteresis loop of a soft magnetic
nature and the relevant parameters (Mr,Ms and Hc) have low values that confirmed the nature of the material. Subsequently,
gas sensors were fabricated to study hydrogen-sensing properties.
The gas sensors showed a response to hydrogen gas at a low temperature
(100 °C) with selective response in the presence of NH3 and C2H5OH gases. The reasons for electrical,
magnetic, and sensing behavior of the samples were discussed in detail.

1 Introduction
Electrical, magnetic,
and gas-sensing properties of metal oxides
majorly depend on the synthesis methods, nature and concentration
of dopants, particle size, annealing temperature, and so forth.1 Among the available metal oxides, spinel ferrites
demonstrate high magnetic permeability, electrical resistance, catalytic
properties, and chemical stability.2−4 Spinel compounds of AB2O4 type where, metal cations of A and B and could
form a closely packed array of O2– ions as with
A2+ and B3+ cations on occupying parts or all
of the tetrahedral and octahedral sites. Being majorly used in microwave,
electronic, magnetic, and electrochemical devices,5−7 nickel ferrite
(NiFe2O4) is one of the important spinel ferrites.
Also, its low eddy and coercivity, and hysteresis loss are highly
beneficial for electronic device applications including in telecommunication
and high-frequency devices.8−10 Magnetic coupling in NiFe2O4 is due to super-exchange where the A–B
interaction coupling is stronger than that of A–A and B–B
couplings.11,12 The angles of B–O–B
and A–O–A bonds are <180°, which eventually
could form a strong super-exchange interaction of the A–B pair.13 The rare-earth cations demonstrate unpaired
electrons with strong magnetic anisotropy; thereby, on their doping,
structural, optical, electrical, dielectric, and magnetic properties
can be greatly improved as magnetic anisotropy in rare-earth-doped
spinel ferrites is related to 4f–3d couplings between transition-metal
and rare-earth ions.14,15 As, for example, Peng et al.
reported improved electrical and magnetic properties of praseodymium-doped
nickel-zinc ferrite,16 Ali et al. reported
enhanced magnetic properties of holmium-substituted cobalt ferrite
with a high coercivity.17 It is well-accepted
that the spinel ferrite nanostructures demonstrate considerable sensing
properties. For example, NiFe2O4 was reported
as a H2S gas sensor in the past.18 Generally, ternary oxides such as perovskites and spinels avail
good stability in reducing atmospheres.19,20 Among different
gases, hydrogen gas is an alternative green energy resource replace
a fossil fuel in future.21 However, it
is highly flammable with a risk of explosion during its storage, transportation,
and use.22 Unfortunately, hydrogen gas
cannot be detected by human senses. Usually, gas chromatography and
mass spectrometry techniques are used to monitor hydrogen gases, which
are associated with large size, high cost, and time consumption.23 Metal oxide-based gas sensors with good sensing
properties can be a good choice for hydrogen gas detection. In particular,
nanoscale-sized metal oxides with good electrical properties are good
enough in gas-sensing studies.24,25 However, generally
sensing temperature for hydrogen gas sensors is often high (≥150
°C), which is not practically viable for commercial benefits.
For example, Jayatissa et al. reported sensor response 4% H2 at 175 °C.26 Also, Falsafi et al.
reported a hydrogen gas sensor based on Sm-doped cobalt ferrite at
200 °C.23 Also, the nickel ferrite
has good gas-sensing ability as compared ferrite materials.66−68

In this study, the Ru-doped nickel ferrite nanoparticles (Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs) were synthesized by using a simple and
cost-effective chemical co-precipitation method which was annealed
at 300, 600, and 900 °C temperatures. The structure, magnetic,
and sensing properties of Ru–NiFe2O4 were
studied and reported. The optimized Ru–NiFe2O4 showed a lower dielectric constant and loss suitable for
low-frequency and gas sensor applications. In particular, the response
time of the Ru–NiFe2O4 sensor toward
selective hydrogen gas was very small at its appropriate concentration,
holding the potential of commercialization.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Structural Studies
Figure 1 illustrates
the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed
at 300, 600, and 900 °C temperatures. The reflection planes of
(111), (220), (311), (222), (400), (422), (511), (440), (620), and
(622) are common in all sensors, which are of a cubic spinel structure.
However, the intensity of peaks for the Ru–NiFe2O4 NP sensor annealed at 300 °C is low, suggesting
poor crystallinity. An additional peak related to α-Fe2O3 is present in sensors annealed at 300 and 600 °C.
Few low-intensity peaks owing to the presence of secondary phases
located at grain-boundaries because of the high reactivity of Fe3+ and Ru3+ ions are noticed in the Ru–NiFe2O4 sensor annealed at 300 °C.27 At higher annealing temperatures, iron ions could distribute
evenly with secondary phases, warranting the formation of the Ru–NiFe2O4.28 The grain sizes
were estimated on the (311) diffraction peak using the Scherrer equation.29 On air-annealing, the grain-size increases from
3 to −48 nm, suggesting stimulation of the nucleation and growth,
which eventually increases the size.30 The
concerned XRD parameters are listed in Table 1.

2.2 Microstructure
Studies
Figure 2a–c illustrates scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) surface images of Ru–NiFe2O4 annealed at 300, 600, and 900 °C, respectively.
As shown, small-sized rounded particles of Ru–NiFe2O4 are evidenced at 300 °C, which are considerably
large when annealed at 600 and 900 °C. At higher annealing temperatures
(≥900 °C), a broad size distribution is confirmed. A change
in the particle size with annealing temperature is a common, which
is reported previously in several ferrite studies.31 In fact, because of temperature-dependence of diffusion,
at higher temperatures, more matter can be diffused, resulting in
the formation of large-sized particles. Figure 3a–c illustrates typical energy-dispersive
X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) spectra of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 300, 600, and 900 °C, respectively,
suggesting an incorporation of a trace amount of Ru in the NiFe2O4 as Ru–NiFe2O4.
In all cases, the peaks related to O, Fe, Ni, and Ru are noted. The
atomic percent of Ru in the Ru–NiFe2O4 NP sensor annealed at 300, 600, and 900 °C 0.66, 0.36, and
0.29 %, respectively. Accordingly, there is no significant difference
between Ru-contents of the samples. The variation Ru content in different
samples can be due to local variation in homogeneity. Figure 4a–d shows typical transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed
at 300, 600, and 900 °C. Increasing annealing temperature and
the Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 900 °C
endow the highest crystallite size. The corresponding selected area
electron diffraction patterns of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs are shown in Figure 4b–e. The continuous rings, in accordance with the nanocrystalline
signature, are sharply appearing, supporting the structural change
in Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs from amorphous to nanocrystalline
with increasing the annealing temperature from 300 to 900 °C.32

2.3 Dielectric
Studies
The dielectric
properties of spinel ferrites depend on annealing temperature and
applied frequency.33Figure 5a illustrates the variation of the dielectric
constant of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs obtained at
different annealing temperatures with frequency. In general, dielectric
properties of ferrites alter with dopants, annealing temperature,
preparation method, distribution of metal cations between A and B
sites, and so forth.34 In the presence
of Ru, the obtained dielectric constants are smaller than those reported
in the literature for NiFe2O4.35−38 The substitution of Ru could result in lattice distortion and change
of bond length between Fe–O and Ru–O at the B site,
producing a change in atomic polarizability and dielectric constant.39,40 From Figure 5a it
is inferred that the dielectric constant is high at small frequencies
and is low at higher frequencies. Also, with increasing frequency,
the dielectric constant decreases at the beginning very rapidly, which
then remains almost constant. The variation in the dielectric constant
of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs at different frequencies
can be explained on the basis of interfacial polarization, ionic and
electronic polarization effect. The dielectric constant decreases,
reaches constant value at high frequency because of the electronic
polarization effect as dipoles cannot follow the electric field, and
charges get spread with a low dielectric constant. On the other hand,
the dielectric constant increases at low frequencies because of the
interfacial polarization effect as electric dipoles follow the electric
field and charges can be accumulated at the interface of grain boundaries
with high dielectric constant.41 Usually,
the dielectric constant increases with annealing temperature. However,
in our case, a reverse trend is noticed. The dielectric constant decreases
because of a variation of valence sites at octahedral sites, that
is, Fe2+ and Fe3+ or electron hopping. The ferrous
ions could be trapped continuously at high temperatures by generating
a low dielectric constant. Also, lattice distortion is another factor
that decreases the dielectric constant as the distance among neighboring
oxygen sites changes with annealing temperature.42Figure 5b provides dielectric loss at different temperatures that is, 300,
600, and 900 °C. The resonance optimums are at two frequencies,
that is, 2.82 and 2.40 Hz, and are evidenced when the jumping frequency
of electrons among ferrous and ferric ions is the same as that of
the frequency of the applied electric field.43 Also, the presence of secondary phases, confirmed for Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 300 and 600 °C temperatures,
creates a resonance peak.44 Because of
the involvement of phase pure spinel structure there is no resonance
peak for Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 900
°C, which can be explained by Koop’s phenomenological
model where ion has more than one equilibrium position, namely, A
and B with same potential energy and, second, the probability of jumping
the ion from A to B and B to A is the same.44 Depending on this probability, the ion exchanges position between
A and B with the same frequency as the natural frequency. When an
external alternating electric field of the same frequency is applied,
the maximum electrical energy can be transferred to the oscillation
ions on shooting the power loss, resulting in resonance.45 The dielectric loss decreases suddenly with
annealing temperature. The fall of dielectric loss can be assigned
to different valence states of ions. In addition, both Ru and Ni ions
occupy the positions of iron ions and the collective effect of these
two ions deduces the hopping electrons a low dielectric loss.13

Figure 5 (a) Dielectric constant and (b) dielectric loss of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at different temperatures.

2.4 Magnetic
Studies
Figure 6a–c illustrates the
hysteresis loops, obtained at room temperature (300 K), of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 300, 600, and 900 °C NPs.
The narrow area of the hysteresis loop demonstrates a soft magnetic
nature, which depends on the crystallinity, dopant, and particle size.46 In spinel ferrites, the configuration of Ni,
Fe, and Ru ions at octahedral and tetrahedral sites changes the magnetization
gesture. The magnetization increased with annealing temperature. The
obtained data of coercivity, retentivity, and saturation magnetization
(Table 1) are lower
than those reported for Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs
in the literature, suggesting that Ru-doping in NiFe2O4 has a favorable effect on its soft magnetic behavior.47−50 Also, the values of magnetic properties, that is, low saturation
magnetization, are smaller on account of forming the magnetically
dead layers on the surface of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs, inducing canting and spin disorder because of broken superexchange
bonds.51 The oscillation of saturation
magnetization is defined by redistribution of cations on A and B sites
and superexchange interaction between A and B sites using Néel’s
ferromagnetic theory.52 On the basis of
this theory, the magnetic moments of octahedral and tetrahedral sites
confirm the magnetization of ferrites. The magnetic moments of Ru,
Ni, and Fe ions are 4, 2, and 5 μB, respectively,
which suggests that the Ni2+ cations are located in A sites
and the trivalent cations (Ru3+ and Fe3+) are
located in B sites which, eventually, increases the resulting magnetization.
Because of a spin disorder, Figure 6 demonstrates an enhanced magnetization of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs with annealing temperatures. In general,
magnetic properties are particle size-dependent. The lower magnetization
of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs annealed at 300 °C
is smaller particle size wherein a high surface disorder is expected.
On further increasing of annealing temperature, the particle size
increases on decreasing the surface disorder followed magnetization.53,54 Also, the coercivity rises with annealing temperatures. Generally,
the coercivity increases with decrease of the particle size, but in
this study, the reverse trend has been evidenced. This is because
of the fact that the grain boundaries can lead to increase pinning
sites for spins, leading to increase in the coercivity. In addition,
structural defects such as oxygen vacancies and lattice strains also
increase the coercivity.55 The rise of
coercivity depicts transition of the magnetic single-domain to the
multidomain where the exchange coupling becomes strong, which results
in a lesser disorder magnetic anisotropy among domains.56 The strong exchange coupling leads to an increase
in retentivity with respect to annealing temperature, suggesting growth
of anisotropic properties.

ferrite NPs at

2.5 Sensing Studies
Figure 7 illustrates dynamic resistance
hydrogen-sensing curves of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs against 50 ppm hydrogen gas at different operating temperatures
ranging from 25 to 150 °C. In all gas sensors, the electrical
resistance increases upon exposure to hydrogen gas, demonstrating
the p-type nature of the gas sensors. Also, the air resistance of
gas sensors decreases upon increasing the operation temperature, indicating
semiconducting behavior in Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs. The gas-sensing mechanism is based on the variation of resistance
change of the gas sensor in the presence of hydrogen gas. First, when
the sensor is in air, oxygen gas can be adsorbed on its surface. The
amount of adsorbed oxygen species depends on the particle size, surface
area, surface condition, and operating temperature. The relevant reactions
are as follows: 1   2   3  

Figure 7 (a–c)
Dynamic resistance curves of Ru-doped nickel ferrite
NPs at different annealing temperatures.

The oxygen species capture electrons from the conduction
band of
the gas sensor, that is, Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs,
increasing the hole concentration. After injection of hydrogen gas,
the following reaction takes place 4  and released electrons return back to the
surface of the gas sensor, leading to increase of the sensor resistance,
which is a p-type material.63 Accordingly,
a response is observed. In addition, because of the difference between
work functions of the Ru and NiFe2O4, heterojunctions
can be generated between the Ru and NiFe2O4.
Upon exposure to hydrogen gas, the height of these heterojunctions
changes, leading to modulation of electrical resistance of the gas
sensor with a moderate sensor signal. In general, the electrical resistance
of the gas sensor is higher in comparison to results reported for
phase pure and doped NiFe2O4 in the past.57 Accordingly, the presence of Ru in B-sites leads
to increase of the sensor resistance.58 Because of transfer of electrons from Ru to NiFe2O4 there may be change in the sensor resistance as Ru, with
a large ionic radius, causes the lattice distortion.59 All Ru–NiFe2O4 NP gas sensors
showed a response of 1.1, which is slightly higher than that previously
reported for NiFe2O4. Sapna et al. reported
the sensitivity of the NiFe2O4 thick film sensor
with a response of 1.09–300 ppm hydrogen gas at 175 °C.61 In our previous Li–NiFe2O4 gas sensor, a response of 1.08–100 ppm hydrogen gas
at 200 °C was documented.57 The response
increases from 25 to 100 °C and then decreases at 150 °C.
Accordingly, the optimal sensing temperature is 100 °C. At this
temperature, the response to 100 ppm hydrogen gas is 1.36. The thermally
activated electrons can be increased during rise of operating temperature
up to 100 °C, leading to increase in adsorption of gas molecules
on the surface of the sensor.60 The response
followed sensitivity decreases at 150 °C, which describes faster
desorption than adsorption. The optimal sensing temperature is relatively
small in comparison with temperatures reported for ferrite gas sensors.
For example, Falsafi et al. demonstrated hydrogen gas sensing of Sm–CoFe2O4 at an optimum sensing temperature of 200 °C.23 Mitra et al. reported hydrogen gas-sensing properties
of ZnFe2O4 at 200 °C.62 Our previous report on Li–NiFe2O4 demonstrated an optimum sensing temperature at 200 °C.57 Among Ru–NiFe2O4 NP gas sensors, the gas sensor annealed at 300 °C showed the
highest gas response, which is attributed to the presence of smaller-sized
particles and the presence of the α-Fe2O3. In fact, the co-existence of Fe2O3 and NiFe2O4 phases can generate heterojunctions, which significantly
can modulate the electrical resistance of the gas sensor. Even though
gas sensors annealed at 300 and 600 °C have demonstrated the
Fe2O3 phase, but amount of Fe2O3 in the previous sensor was higher than in the latter. Also,
it should be noticed that after 300 °C the particle size increases
drastically with decrease of specific surface area as a function of
annealing temperature, producing a low response.63 In fact, smaller particles demonstrate higher surface area,
which means adsorption of oxygen and hydrogen gases, leading to higher
response of the gas sensor.64Figure 8 illustrates long-term
stability and reproducibility of Ru–NiFe2O4 NP sensors after a 6 month period. On the basis of these data, as-developed
hydrogen sensors confirm nearly the same response. The slight declination
in response is due to adsorption of humidity on the surface of the
gas sensor.65 Also, the gas sensors reveal
∼85% reproducibility. The selectivity tests, performed on 50
ppm of ammonia, ethanol, and hydrogen gas, are shown in Figure 9. It can be seen that the Ru–NiFe2O4 NP gas sensor shows a response to hydrogen gas
in comparison with NH3 and C2H5OH
gases, demonstrating its selectivity to hydrogen gas.

3 Conclusions
In a nutshell, we report
on the co-precipitate method-mediated
synthesis and structural, magnetic, and sensing properties of annealed
Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs. The samples were annealed
at different temperatures. XRD, SEM, TEM and energy-dispersive X-ray
analyses were performed to study the crystallinity, morphology, and
chemical composition of the samples. Dielectric properties including
dielectric constant and dielectric loss showed low value according
to different annealing temperatures. Magnetic properties including
hysteresis loops describe the soft behavior of NPs. Hydrogen gas sensing
properties that contained sensitivity and response of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs investigated. Changes in structure, magnetic,
and gas-sensing performance are due to alteration in the particle
of the Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs as a function of
annealing temperature.

4 Experimental Details
4.1 Synthesis of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs
The chemical co-precipitation method was used
for the synthesis of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs.
Analytical grade starting materials, that is, ruthenium chloride (RuCl3), nickel chloride (NiCl2), and ferric chloride
(FeCl3), were used as received. Required proportions of
precursor salts were mixed and the aqueous solutions were prepared
under continuous magnetic stirring. The final homogenized solution
was obtained by stirring at 60 °C, whose pH was adjusted to 11
using aqueous NaOH solution. This solution was washed several times
to remove chloride and inorganic contaminates, if there could be any,
and the precipitate was dried in an oven at 100 °C for 1 day.
The dried powder was ground well using a mortar and pestle for 2 h
and was annealed at 300, 600, and 900 °C annealing temperatures
in a muffle furnace.

4.2 Measurement Details
The structure
and crystallinity of Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs,
annealed at different temperatures, were inspected using XRD spectra.
Morphologies of the as-synthesized sensors were confirmed from the
SEM and TEM digital photo images. Chemical compositions were identified
using EDXS, which was in line with the SEM unit. Dielectric properties
were investigated using an LCR meter. The hysteresis parameters were
obtained from the hysteresis loop acquired from a vibrational sample
magnetometer. Hydrogen-sensing properties were investigated using
a gas-sensing system. The Ru–NiFe2O4 NPs
were prepared in pellet form using a hydraulic pelletizer. The upper
and lower surfaces of the pellets were painted with silver paste for
better electrical connections, which, in reality, served as electrodes
during gas-sensing tests.
