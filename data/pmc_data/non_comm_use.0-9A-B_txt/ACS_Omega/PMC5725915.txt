Human
factor Va (hfVa) is the important regulatory subunit of prothrombinase.
Recent modeling data have suggested a critical role for amino acid
Arg701 of hfVa for human prothrombin (hPro) activation
by prothrombinase. Furthermore, it has also been demonstrated that
hfVa has a different effect than that of bovine fVa on prethrombin-1
activation by prothrombinase. The difference between the two cofactor
molecules was also found within the Asn700–Arg701 dipeptide in the human factor V (hfV) molecule, which is
replaced by the Asp–Glu sequence in bfV. As a consequence,
we produced a recombinant hfV (rhfV) molecule with the substitution 700NR701→DE. rhfVNR→DE together
with the wild-type molecule (rhfVWT) were expressed in
COS7 cells, purified, and tested for their capability to function
within prothrombinase. Kinetic studies showed that the Kd of rhfVaNR→DE for human fXa as well
as the kcat and Km of prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE for
hPro activation were similar to the values obtained following hPro
activation by prothrombinase made with rhfVaWT. Remarkably,
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analyses
of hPro activation time courses demonstrated that the rate of cleavage
of hPro by prothrombinase reconstituted with rhfVaNR→DE was significantly delayed with substantial accumulation of meizothrombin,
and delayed thrombin generation, when compared to activation of hPro
by prothrombinase made with rhfVaWT. These unanticipated
results provide significant insights on the role of the carboxyl-terminal
end of the heavy chain of hfVa for hPro cleavage and activation by
prothrombinase and show that residues 700NR701 regulate at least in part the enzyme–substrate/product interaction
during fibrin clot formation.

==== Body
Introduction
Human
factor Va (hfVa) is the important regulatory subunit of prothrombinase
that controls the rate of human prothrombin (hPro) activation by prothrombinase
during hemostasis.1 This process is a highly
regulated event, which involves various enzymatic entities that participate
in a series of reactions. Prothrombinase activation of hPro is the
penultimate step in the coagulation cascade implemented after any
event that exposes a procoagulant membrane surface.2 In vivo, the procoagulant membrane surface is usually delivered
by activated platelets and/or endothelial cells.3,4 Human
factor Xa (hfXa), the enzymatic subunit of prothrombinase, can itself
activate hPro after two consecutive cleavages at Arg271 and Arg320 to yield prethrombin-2 (Pre2). Association
of the regulatory molecule hfVa with fXa will lead to the establishment
of the prothrombinase complex, and a switch of the order of cleavages
(Arg320 followed by Arg271) will yield the intermediate
meizothrombin (MzT). This complex increases the enzymatic activity
of hfXa by 300 000-fold.5−9 It is believed that the regulatory subunit of prothrombinase, hfVa,
has a substantial effect on this reversal of cleavages, thus aiding
in presenting Arg320 of the substrate to the catalytic
subunit of prothrombinase.

Human factor V (hfV) is present in
blood at 20 nM as a single chain
protein with a high molecular weight (Mr of 330 000). It is composed of three protein domains (A–C)
that will produce a two-subunit protein made of light and heavy chains
following cleavage and activation by thrombin at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545 (Figure 1).10−13 The 105 000 heavy chain is bound to the 74 000
light chain through hydrophobic interactions. These hydrophobic interactions
are only exposed on the hfV/hfVa molecule following its interaction
with calcium ions ( Figure 1).14

Figure 1 hfV. Left panel, hfV
structure; hfV is composed of three A domains
(red), two C domains (light blue), and a B region (yellow). hfV is
activated following three sequential cleavages by α-thrombin
at Arg709, Arg1018, and Arg1545.
These cleavages are required to release the active cofactor composed
of heavy (amino acids 1–709) and light (amino acids 1546–2196)
chains noncovalently associated in the presence of divalent metal
ions, and two activation fragments. The carboxyl-terminal portion
of the heavy chain contains an acidic hirudin-like amino acid region
that is important for cofactor function.26 Adjacent to this region are also the amino acids Asn700 and Arg701, which are important for cofactor activity.33 The amino acid substitutions within the heavy
chain are indicated together with the designation for the recombinant
mutant hfV molecule created and used throughout the article. Right
panel; electrophoretic analyses of rhfVNR→DE and
rhfVaNR→DE molecules. rhfVNR→DE was activated with thrombin as described in the Experimental Section and analyzed
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE).
Following transfer to a poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membrane,
immunoreactive fragments were detected with the monoclonal antibodies
αHFVaHC17 (recognizing an epitope on the heavy chain
of the cofactor between amino acid residues 307–506) and αHFVaHC9 (recognizing the light chain). The positions of the heavy/light
chains of hfVa are shown on the right. Lane 1, rhfVNR→DE; lane 2, rhfVaNR→DE.

Mature hPro is an inactive zymogen with a Mr of 72 000 that has undergone substantial post-translational
modifications before being secreted by the liver. Included in these
modifications is the carboxylation of several glutamic acids at the
NH2-terminus, a process that is vitamin K-dependent and
is essential for proper binding of hPro to the procoagulant surface,
which in turn is required for timely and efficient activation by prothrombinase.
Thrombin has two charged regions (anion binding exosite I (ABE-I)
and anion binding exosite II (ABE-II)), which are vital for its function.
ABE-I is responsible for interacting with a plethora of proteins participating
in the coagulation cascade like hfV, hfVa, and fibrinogen. ABE-II
is the heparin-binding site.15−20

The Kd value of the hfVa–hPro
interaction is 1 μM.21,22 hfVa provides binding
sites for proexosite 1 and the Gla domain of hPro, explaining one
of the possible mechanisms by which the cofactor functions to increase
enzyme efficiency.20,23 It has been proven that several
acidic amino acids at the very end of the heavy chain of hfVa are
vital for hfVa cofactor activity24−30 and participate in the interaction of hPro with prothrombinase.
It has been proposed that amino acids from the region 680–709
are required for proper interaction and catalysis of hPro by hfXa
within prothrombinase.26,28,31 Further, we have hypothesized that these acidic residues may be
involved in the direct binding of hfVa with hPro and/or thrombin through
positively charged amino acids. This substantial increase in enzymatic
activity resulting in rapid thrombin generation is credited to the
precise and unique interactions of the cofactor with specific amino
acids affiliated with both membrane-bound hfXa and membrane-bound
hPro, as recently demonstrated.32 Accordingly,
introduction of the nonenzymatic cofactor into prothrombinase equips
the organism with the coagulation artillery necessary for the explosive
arrest of vasculature bleeding.

A substantial difference was
demonstrated when bovine factor Va
(bfVa) or hfVa were used to activate prethrombin-1 (Pre1) by prothrombinase.33 The reason for the different effect of the cofactor
on Pre1 was shown to be confined within the very last portion of the
COOH-terminus of the hfVa heavy chain. A prominent difference in amino
acid between the two cofactor molecules in that region is restricted
to positions 700–701 where an Asn–Arg dipeptide in hfVa
is replaced by the Asp–Glu sequence in bfVa,34−36 resulting in
a total replacement of the net positive charge with two negative charges.
Interestingly, very recently modeling data have shown that Arg701 of hfVa interacts with Glu345 of hPro.32 The work undertaken herein proposes to evaluate
the significance of the 700Asn–Arg701 dipeptide of the hfVa heavy chain for enzyme–substrate recognition/interaction
during hPro activation by prothrombinase. A substantial amino acid
change, and a change in charge, in this portion of the cofactor will
allow for an in-depth study of this very important contributor of
prothrombinase. We directly tested the function of this portion of
the heavy chain by using a recombinant molecule and several specific
assays. The remarkable and unpredicted results presented herein solidify
the notion that the acidic carboxyl-terminus of the heavy chain of
hfVa is critical for proper prothrombinase function and dictates the
timely interaction of hFVa with the substrate/product, as recently
suggested by modeling studies of prothrombinase.32

Results and Discussion
Transient Expression and Analysis of rhfVNR→DE
To ascertain the significance of the
amino acid region
700–701 of hfVa, we made a recombinant mutant factor V molecule
(rhfV) with the substitution NR→DE (Figure 1, left panel). Figure 1, right panel, shows a typical quality control
practice. The data show the makeup of rhfVNR→DE before
(right panel, lane 1) and after (right panel, lane 2) activation by
thrombin. After treatment with thrombin, no rhfVNR→DE was apparent on the gel, whereas fragments with the molecular weights
of the two subunits were visible (a fragment of Mr 105 000 representing the heavy chain and a fragment
of Mr 74 000 representing the light
chain, both identified with monoclonal antibodies specifically made
against each subunit). Clotting activity assays illustrated the fact
that activation of rhfVWT gave rise to a molecule with
similar activity to that of the plasma-derived molecule (Table 1).26,36 In contrast, using analogous experimental conditions, rhfVaNR→DE had ∼17-fold less clotting activity (Table 1). These results are
unexpected, and they show that amino acids 700–701 are essential
for expression of rhfVa clotting activity.

Characterization
of rhfVa Molecules through Kinetic Experiments
The kinetic
effect that hfVa has on the prothrombinase-mediated
activation of hPro has been well-studied over the past 50 years, but
it is still not properly understood, and no specific molecular role
has yet been assigned to the cofactor. Research with discontinuous
assays using a chromogenic substrate for thrombin revealed that when
hfVa is combined into the prothrombinase complex, the overall increase
in activity of the enzymatic complex for the activation of hPro, compared
to cleavage and activation of hPro by fXa alone, is substantially
increased, making the two-subunit enzyme one of the most proficient
catalysts known in the human body and similar to several other enzymes
required for survival such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, and
carbonic anhydrase. This significant increase in affinity of prothrombinase
toward its substrate is attributed to tighter binding of the enzyme
complex to hPro because of its localization on the membrane surface
by hfVa. Thus, hfVa enhances thrombin generation by facilitating initial
cleavage at Arg320 on hPro by hfXa that provides for the
generation of an important enzymatic intermediate, MzT, with demonstrated
anticoagulant activity.

We next evaluated the ability of rhfVaNR→DE to bind rhfXa and form prothrombinase (Table 1). The data show that
rhfVaWT has similar affinity for fXa as its plasma counterpart.26,36 Similarly, rhfVaNR→DE has comparable affinity
for plasma-derived fXa, which is approximately the same as the affinity
of rhfVaWT for fXa. These data demonstrate that residues
700–701 from the heavy chain of fVa, while being a major contributor
for optimal expression of fVa clotting activity, do not contribute
to the interaction between the cofactor and fXa. We subsequently assessed
the consequence of the mutation on the Km and kcat of the enzyme. The resulting
kinetic graphs are shown in Figure 2, and the constants of the enzyme made with either
rhfVaWT or rhfVaNR→DE are provided in Table 1. The results surprisingly
demonstrate that the amino acid substitutions had no substantial effect
on either the Km of the reaction or on
the catalytic efficiency of prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 2, Table 1). Compared to the
data using the clotting assays, these unexpected results are somehow
puzzling, and thus far demonstrate that the NR→DE substitution
only affects the clotting activity of rhfVaNR→DE. The kinetic data alone do not provide an explanation for the impaired
clotting activity of rhfVaNR→DE.

Figure 2 Raw data used for the
determination of the kinetic parameters of
prothrombinase complex assembly and function. Initial rates of thrombin
generation were determined as described in the Experimental
Section. The data obtained were fit by nonlinear regression
analysis to the Michaelis–Menten equation to obtain the Km and Vmax. Prothrombinase
assembled with rhfVaWT is shown by filled squares (R2 = 0.98, three titrations with two different
preparations of rhfVaWT) whereas prothrombinase assembled
with rhfVaNR→DE is depicted by filled triangles
(R2 = 0.96, three titrations with three
different preparations of rhfVaNR→DE). The values
of the Km and Vmax/ET (=kcat) extracted directly from these graphs are listed in Table 1.

Visualization of the Activation Pathway
Because of
the unexpected and contradictory results obtained in the activity
assays (clotting vs kinetic assay), and to better appreciate the reason
for the dearth in clotting activity of rhfVaNR→DE, we evaluated hPro activation by SDS-PAGE. The results display a
considerable and significant delay in hPro activation by prothrombinase
made with rhfVaNR→DE when related to cleavage of
hPro by prothrombinase reconstituted with rhfVaWT with
MzT lingering very late in the reaction and with little visible thrombin
formation (Figure 3). Densitometry scanning of the SDS-PAGE results presented in Figure 3 established a 10-fold
delay in hPro cleavage by prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE when matched to the consumption of hPro with prothrombinase assembled
with rhfVaWT (Figure 4, Table 2). Furthermore, it is clearly visible on the gels that when hPro
is cleaved by prothrombinase reconstituted with rhfVaNR→DE, there is lingering of MzT during the activation time course. A
peak for MzT is noticeable at 60 s when hPro is cleaved by prothrombinase
made with rhfVaWT, and a peak for MzT is present at ∼600
s when hPro is processed by prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 4). These
data can explain the paradoxical findings above and the apparent discrepancy
between the clotting and kinetic assays, and they undeniably suggest
that the slow accumulation of MzT is responsible for the poor clotting
activity observed with rhfVaNR→DE. These data also
verify our previous findings,26 and demonstrate
that MzT can counterbalance the dearth of thrombin activity in the
chromogenic test because its catalytic activity toward the chromogenic
substrate used in our study is much higher than that of thrombin,
as previously demonstrated.26,37,38

Figure 3 Analysis
of the activation of plasma-derived hPro by prothrombinase.
Plasma-derived hPro (1.4 μM) was incubated in different mixtures
with PCPS vesicles (20 μM), and prothrombinase was assembled
with either wild-type rhfVa (panel A, 20 nM) or rhfVaNR→DE (panel B, 20 nM), as described in the Experimental
Section. At selected time intervals, aliquots of the reactions
were withdrawn and treated as described in the Experimental
Section. M represents the lane with the molecular
weight markers (from top to bottom): Mr 98 000, Mr 64 000, Mr 50 000, Mr 36 000, Mr 22 000. Lanes
1–17 represent samples from the reaction mixture before (0
min) the addition of fXa and 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180,
200, 220, 240 s, 5, 6, 10, and 20 min, respectively, following the
addition of fXa. The hPro-derived fragments are shown as follows:
Pro (hPro, amino acid residues 1–579); P1 (prethrombin-1, amino
acid residues 156–579); F1•2-A (fragment 1•2-A
chain, amino acid residues 1–320); F1•2 (fragment 1•2,
amino acid residues 1–271); P2 (prethrombin-2, amino acid residues
272–579); B (B chain of α-thrombin, amino acid residues
321–579). F1 (fragment 1, amino acid residues 1−155);
F2 (fragment 2, amino acid residues 156−271).

Progress curves for products and reactants for the activation of hPro
by prothrombinase assembled with rhfVaWT (filled symbols)
or rhfVaNR→DE (open symbols) were obtained by quantitative
densitometry of the gels shown in Figure 3A,B, as described in the Experimental Section. The graphs illustrate the disappearance
of hPro (circles), the transient formation of MzT (squares), and the
accumulation of the B chain of α-thrombin (triangles). The lines
for the disappearance of hPro were drawn according to the equation
of a one phase exponential decay (rhfVaWT, R2 = 0.99, and rhfVaNR→DE, R2 = 0.99). The lines depicting the formation of MzT and
the accumulation of the B chain of α-thrombin were arbitrarily
drawn. Additional data points extending to 1 h of incubation have
been omitted for clarity.

Our data clearly
show that although prothrombinase assembled with
rhfVaNR→DE has similar Km and kcat as prothrombinase assembled
with rhfVaWT, the clotting activity of rhfVNR→DE is severely impaired. In addition, visualization of the cleavage
pattern of hPro activation by prothrombinase assembled with rhfVaNR→DE demonstrated a significantly different pattern
of activation from the gels analyzing hPro activation by prothrombinase
assembled with rhfVaWT. Thus, if we had limited our initial
analysis of the mutant molecule to prothrombinase assays using purified
proteins and a chromogenic substrate without using clotting assays
and gel electrophoresis analysis, as is the case in the majority of
the studies assessing mutations in the hfVa molecule, we would have
missed and dismissed the particular critical regulatory function of
this region of the molecule, as was the case on multiple occasions
in the past.39

Activation of Recombinant
Mutant hPro, FPR-MzT, and Pre1 by
Prothrombinase Assembled with rhfVaNR→DE
The data obtained thus far show that both cleavages at Arg320 and Arg271 in hPro appeared to be impaired when using
prothrombinase made with rhFVaNR→DE. To quantify
the level of impairment of each of the cleavages separately in hPro
that were specifically affected by the 700NR→DE701 substitution, we employed recombinant hPro molecules with
only one site specific for prothrombinase cleavage (Arg320 for rMZ-II and Arg271 for rP2-II).40

The results provided in Figure 5A illustrate a substantial delay in the rate
of cleavage of rMZ-II by prothrombinase reconstituted with rhfVaNR→DE (lanes 10–18) when compared to the rate
of activation of rMZ-II by prothrombinase composed with rhfVaWT (lanes 1–9). Scanning densitometry showed that activation
of rMZ-II is slower by ∼10-fold when prothrombinase is made
with rhfVaNR→DE compared to activation of rMZ-II
by prothrombinase composed with rhVaWT (Table 2, Figure 6). A 2-fold slower hPro rate of activation
was also detected when rP2-II was cleaved by prothrombinase reconstituted
with rhfVaNR→DE when matched to the activation of
rP2-II by prothrombinase made with rhfVaWT (Figure 5B, Table 2). These results support our data acquired
with hPro. Altogether, the data suggest that prothrombinase-mediated
cleavages at Arg320/Arg271 in hPro are significantly
delayed when prothrombinase is made with rhfVaNR→DE. It is also clear, however, that cleavage at Arg320 is
more affected by the substitution in hfVa than cleavage at Arg271.

Figure 5 Analysis of the activation of rMZ-II and rP2-II. rMZ-II (1.4 μM,
panel A) and rP2-II (1.4 μM, panel B) were incubated in different
mixtures with PCPS vesicles (20 μM), DAPA (3 μM), and
rhfVaWT (20 nM) or rhfVaNR→DE (20 nM).
The reaction was started by the addition of fXa, and the samples were
treated as detailed in the Experimental Section. Lanes 1–9 represent samples of the reaction mixture following
incubation of prothrombinase assembled with rhfVaWT with
rMZ-II or rP2-II before (lane 1) or following 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 45,
60, and 120 min of incubation with fXa, respectively. Lanes 10–18
represent samples of the reaction mixture following incubation of
prothrombinase assembled with rhfVaNR→DE with rMZ-II
or rP2-II before (lane 10) or following 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 45, 60, and
120 min of incubation with fXa, respectively. Positions of hPro-derived
fragments are indicated to the right, as detailed in the legend of Figure 3. For easy reading
of the article, the rhfVa species used for the reconstitution of prothrombinase
are also shown.

Figure 6 Analysis of rMZ-II consumption
by prothrombinase assembled with
rhfVa molecules. The gel shown in Figure 5 (A) was scanned and hPro consumption was
recorded as described in the Experimental Section. Following scanning densitometry, the data representing recombinant
mutant hPro consumption as a function of time (s) were plotted using
nonlinear regression analysis according to the equation representing
a first-order exponential decay using the software Prizm (GraphPad,
San Diego, CA), as described in the Experimental
Section. Prothrombinase was assembled with rhfVaWT (filled circles) or rhfVaNR→DE (open circles).
The apparent first-order rate constant, k (s–1) was obtained directly from the fitted data, and
the resulting numbers representing recombinant mutant hPro consumption
are reported in Table 2.

Examination of the results acquired
up until now with plasma-derived
and recombinant hPro demonstrates that the rate of activation of hPro
or rMZ-II following cleavage at Arg320 is more sensitive
to the mutation in rhfVa than the rate of activation of hPro or rP2-II
following cleavage at Arg271. To understand the effect
of the 700NR701→DE mutations on the cleavage
of hPro at Arg271 alone after the conformational alteration
occurring in hPro following cleavage at Arg320,41 we assessed the change in the rate of cleavage
of FPR-meizothrombin (FPR-MzT) by prothrombinase reconstituted with
rhfVaWT or rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 7). The results demonstrate
a considerable delay for cleavage of FPR-MzT at Arg271 by
prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE (panel B) when
related to the reaction that is catalyzed by prothrombinase reconstituted
with rhfVaWT (panel A). Densitometry scanning analysis
of the concentration of fragment 1•2-A confirmed an ∼3-fold
delay in cleavage of FPR-MzT at Arg271 by prothrombinase
made with rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 8, Table 2). However, it is worth noting that the maximum effect
on the rate of cleavage at Arg271 of MzT credited to the
binding of hfVa with hfXa on a cell/membrane surface is 4-fold.8,9 Thus, the 700NR701→DE mutations in
the fVa heavy chain also considerably impede acceleration for cleavage
at this site by prothrombinase.

and quantified as detailed in the Experimental Section. Panel A, prothrombinase assembled with rhfVaWT; panel

following the addition of fXa. The hPro-derived fragments are shown
as detailed in the legend to Figure 3. The recombinant rhfVa species used for the reconstitution
of prothrombinase is also shown under each panel.

Figure 8 Analysis of FPR-MzT consumption by prothrombinase assembled with
rhfVa molecules. The gels shown in Figure 7 were scanned and FPR-MzT consumption was
recorded as described in the Experimental
Section. Following scanning densitometry, the data representing
FPR-MzT consumption as a function of time (s) were plotted using nonlinear
regression analysis according to the equation representing a first-order
exponential decay using the software Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego, CA),
as described in the Experimental Section.
The apparent first-order rate constant k (s–1) was obtained directly from the fitted data. Prothrombinase was
assembled with rhfVaWT (filled circles) or rhfVaNR→DE (open circles); factor fXa alone cleavage of FPR-MzT is shown by
the open squares. The resulting numbers representing FPR-MzT consumption
are reported in Table 2.

To determine the effect of the 700NR701→DE
substitutions within the factor Va heavy chain on the cleavage of
hPro at Arg320 alone when the substrate is not associated
with the membrane surface, we compared the rates of activation of
Pre1 by prothrombinase made with rhfVaWT and rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 9). Under the conditions used, the results show a substantial
delay for activation of Pre1 following cleavage at Arg320 by prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE (panel
B) when related to the reaction catalyzed by prothrombinase reconstituted
with hfVaWT (panel A). Scanning of Pre1 from the gels depicted
in Figure 9 confirmed
an ∼4-fold delay in activation of Pre1 at Arg320 by prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE (Figure 10, Table 2). As a consequence, the 700NR701→DE mutations in the rhfVa heavy
chain substantially impair activation of Pre1 by prothrombinase because
of an impaired capability for cleavage at Arg320 even when
the substrate (Pre1) is not associated with a membrane surface.

(from top to bottom): Mr 50 000, Mr 36 000, Mr 22 000. Lanes 1–19 represent samples from the reaction
mixture before and after the addition of fXa as previously described.20 The hPro-derived fragments are shown as detailed
in the legend to Figure 3. The fragment denoted as P2′ depicts Pre2 cleaved at Arg284. For easy reading of the article, the rhfVa species used
for the reconstitution of prothrombinase is also shown under each
panel.

Figure 10 Analysis of Prethrombin-1 consumption
by prothrombinase assembled
with rhfVa molecules. The gels shown in Figure 9 were scanned and Pre1 consumption was recorded
as described in the Experimental Section.
Following scanning densitometry, the data representing Pre1 consumption
as a function of time (s) were plotted using nonlinear regression
analysis according to the equation representing a first-order exponential
decay using the software Prizm (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), as described
in the Experimental Section. The apparent
first-order rate constant k (s–1) was obtained directly from the fitted data. Prothrombinase was
assembled with rhfVaWT (filled circles), rhfVaNR→DE (open circles); cleavage by fXa alone is shown by open squares.
The resulting numbers representing Pre1 consumption are reported in Table 2.

Thus, because we have studied the consequence of the mutations
on the clotting activity and on the rate of each cleavage individually,
by analyzing activation of rMZ-II, rP2-II, FPR-MzT, and Pre1 by SDS-PAGE
using prothrombinase made with rhfVaNR→DE, we can
determine that both cleavages at Arg320 and Arg271 are impaired, resulting in MzT being present through the hPro activation
process. In addition, a substantial increase in the concentration
of MzT in our assays (as shown in Figure 4) can explain the initial inconsistent findings.
The additional MzT molecules present throughout the time course, while
lacking clotting activity, can compensate for the lack of thrombin
activity in the assays using purified proteins because the molecule
has augmented amidolytic activity toward chromogenic substrates that
are, in general, used to evaluate thrombin activity, thus generating
the wrong conclusion that the NR→DE substitution has negligible
or no effect on prothrombinase activity.

The hypothesis that
fVa confines and places hPro in an optimum
position for efficient catalysis by fXa was confirmed by computational
studies with prothrombinase by Shim et al.,32 who demonstrated that the acidic end of the heavy chain of hfVa
is essential in its ability to capture the serine protease domain
of hPro and reposition the Arg320 cleavage site at an optimal
position for well-timed cleavage by fXa and hPro activation.42 These productive interactions between the acidic
amino acids from the carboxyl-terminal portion of the hfVa heavy chain
and hPro have been repeatedly suggested following experiments with
synthetic peptides and recombinant hfVa molecules.26−28 In particular,
Shim et al. proposed a direct interaction between Arg701 of fVa and Gln345 of hPro, the latter being only 24 amino
acids away from the crucial activating hPro cleavage site at Arg320.32 They also proposed a salt
bridge between Asp695 of hfVa and Lys340 of
hPro, and between Tyr698 of fVa and Lys474 of
hPro.32 We show that replacement of Arg701 in hfVa by a Glu, and the subsequent loss of the positive
charge, results in a considerable delay in activating hPro following
cleavage at Arg320. We have also shown repeatedly that
Asp695 and Tyr698 are a part of a peptide portion
of the hfVa heavy chain that represents a control switch for the activity
of prothrombinase.27,28 Overall our experimental data
together with the recent computational model of hfVa clearly establish
a prolific interaction between the acidic carboxyl-terminus of the
hfVa heavy chain and several residues adjacent or nearby to the crucial
cleavage site at Arg320 of hPro for timely thrombin production.

Conclusions
The specific amino acid sequence 700–701
from hfVa is not
strictly conserved among species36 (indicated
by the vertical arrow in Figure 11). Although hfVa has the identical sequence as higher
primates and fVa from horse, all other species shown in Figure 11 have different
amino acids at these two positions, suggesting an important role of
these two residues within fVa. Although there is no effect of the 700NR701→DE mutation in hfVa on the direct
binding of hfVa to hfXa, there is a significant effect of the mutation
on hPro activation by prothrombinase reconstituted with the mutated
cofactor molecule, which is translated by hindered cleavage at both
Arg320/Arg271. Consequently, our results strongly
suggest that these amino acids are part of an important sequence that
is accountable for the recognition and interaction of the substrate
(Pro) with prothrombinase within different species. Furthermore, the
data presented herein support the notion that Arg701 of
the hfVa heavy chain makes a salt bridge with Glu345 of
hPro, thus facilitating and promoting initial cleavage of hPro at
Arg320, which was suggested by a recent computational model
of prothrombinase.32 Collectively, the
results strongly suggest that hfVa, the regulatory subunit of prothrombinase,
undeniably controls the activity of hfXa within the enzymatic complex
by directing the enzymatic subunit toward cleavage at Arg320, and thus actively participates in the cleavage and activation of
hPro by prothrombinase. We must also conclude that all assays used
herein to characterize rhfVaNR→DE are not redundant,
but rather they are complimentary and a procedural requirement to
understand the structural intricacies of the cofactor and its contributions
to the activity of prothrombinase.

were performed using the method of Laemmli.44 Western blotting using poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) membranes
was performed according to Towbin et al.45 Following transfer to PVDF, fV heavy and light chain(s) were identified
using the suitable monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies46−49 and chemiluminescence.

Analysis of hPro Activation by Gel Electrophoresis
