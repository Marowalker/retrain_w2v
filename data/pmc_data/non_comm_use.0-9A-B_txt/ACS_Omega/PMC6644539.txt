The high thermal
stability of the Lewis
acidic ZnCl2-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride ionic
liquid enables the in situ fabrication of hierarchical nanostructured
Pd–Au bimetallic surfaces via electrochemical alloying/dealloying
of (PdAu)Zn on PdAu substrate in the ionic liquid. Nanostructured
PdAu samples that consist of patterned cracks and ligaments are fabricated
by using potential cycling method and constant-potential electrolysis
method, respectively. The effects of working temperature and amounts
of the deposited Zn on the morphology of the dealloyed (PdAu)Zn nanostructure
are examined. The formation of the hierarchical nanostructure is a
compromise between high-surface-diffusive Au and low-surface-diffusive
Pd. Whereas Au in the alloy promotes the nanostructure formation,
Pd in the PdAu nanostructure protects this material from coarsening.
Compared with the plain PdAu, the nanostructured PdAu surface prepared
at 150 °C exhibits a significantly higher active surface area
and a high capability for the electro-oxidation of glucose.

Introduction
Micro-
and nanoporous metal
materials are useful for a wide variety of applications such as electrocatalysis,
sensors, and others because of their high active surface area-to-volume
ratio associated with their porous structure.1 Among the various methods developed for fabricating porous metals,
dealloying has received great attention owing to its easy operation.1 In a dealloying process, the less-noble component
of an alloy is selectively dissolved either chemically or electrochemically,
resulting in a porous structure of the nobler component.2−14 Among the various
alloys, Zn-based alloys have been widely studied for the dealloying
process.3,15−17 The evolution of the
porous structure during dealloying
has been described in detail.11,12 The porosity evolution
is a result of surface diffusion and reorganization of the nobler
metal at the dealloying interface and therefore is strongly associated
with the surface diffusivity (mobility) of the respective alloy components;
a higher metal surface diffusivity usually promotes the formation
of pores. However, a high surface diffusivity also promotes the coarsening
of the porous structure because porous metals are thermodynamically
metastable and tend to reduce their surface energy via coarsening.
As observed for the nanoporous gold material, coarsening may greatly
reduce the usable lifetimes of the porous metals.13 One way to reduce coarsening is to add a slowly moving
noble third component to the precursor alloy. As demonstrated by adding
Pt to the Ag–Au alloy prior to dealloying, the lower Pt surface
diffusivity successfully hinders coarsening.14

Most of the earlier studies of dealloying were focused on
binary alloy systems, but recently ternary or multicomponent alloy
systems such as Al–Pd–Au,18 Cu–Au–Pt,19 Ag–Au–Pt,20,21 and glassy Pd–Ni–P22 have
attracted increasing attention for the fabrication of nanoporous materials.
To date, most of the dealloying studies are performed using alloy
precursors prepared by high-temperature thermal casting, followed
by chemical etching in corrosive media. By contrast, electrochemical
alloying and dealloying can be another approach for the fabrication
of porous metals. For example, the electrodeposition of CuNi alloy
in an aqueous electrolyte, followed by the electrochemical dissolution
of Cu from the alloy, results in petal-like nanoporous Ni materials23,24 which are applied for electrocatalysis and energy storage devices.
Furthermore, nanostructured metal materials have also been fabricated
by the electrodeposition of Zn onto the metal surfaces such as Pt,25 Au,26 Ag,27 Cu,28,29 and Pd in an ambient-temperature
ionic liquid,30 followed by the electrochemical
dissolution of Zn under relatively mild conditions. The electrochemical
alloying/dealloying approach could be a convenient and green-chemistry
approach for fabricating nanostructured materials because the alloying
process can be operated at a relatively low temperature compared to
thermal casting and allow easy adjustment of the alloy composition
and recycle of the dealloyed component. With electrochemical alloying/dealloying,
bicontinuous nanoporous structures are obtained for relatively mobile
metals such as Au,26 Ag,27 and Cu,28,29 but cracklike nanopatterned structures
are obtained for less mobile metals such as Pt25 and Pd.30 Furthermore, it was
found that to improve the formation of alloy during electrochemical
alloying step, a moderate high temperature around 120–170 °C
is beneficial. In this regard, ambient-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes
appear to be more preferable than aqueous electrolytes because of
their superior properties including high thermal stability, low vapor
pressure, low flammability, and wide electrochemical window in comparison
with conventional molecular solvents.31,32

Although
the electrochemical formation of binary alloys for the electrochemical
dealloying fabrication of nanostructured materials has been reported,
electrochemical alloying of ternary alloys for the electrochemical
fabrication of nanostructured materials is less explored. In view
of this, the nanostructured Pd–Au alloys are valuable materials
for various applications.18,33−40 Herein, we report the fabrication of Pd–Au nanostructures
by electrochemical alloying/dealloying of Zn on PdAu substrate in
a Lewis acidic ZnCl2-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride
(40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC) ionic liquid.41 Two different electrochemical methods multiscan
cyclic voltammetry and constant-potential electrolysis were compared
for this purpose. In the multiscan cyclic voltammetric method, the
potential of the PdAu substrate was cycled between a cathodic value
and an anodic value. Zn was deposited on the PdAu substrate during
the cathodic potential sweep and stripped off during the anodic potential
sweep. The morphology of the resulted PdAu nanostructure was found
to be dependent on the number of potential cycles. In the constant-potential
electrolysis method, a certain amount of Zn was electrodeposited at
a constant cathodic potential, followed by removing Zn at a constant
anodic potential. The effects of the working temperature and amounts
of the electrodeposited Zn on the evolution of the nanostructures
were investigated. It was found that the constant-potential electrolysis
method produced finer PdAu nanostructures than the multiscan cyclic
voltammetric method. The presence of highly mobile Au facilitates
the nanoligament formation. Meanwhile, the presence of less mobile
Pd slows down the coarsening that could be resulted from the diffusion
of Au. Therefore, hierarchical PdAu nanostructures containing both
patterned cracks and nanoligaments were obtained. The prepared nanostructured
PdAu appear to be a good electrode material for electrocatalytic reactions
such as glucose electro-oxidation.

Results
and Discussion
Typical cyclic voltammograms for the electrodeposition
and stripping of Zn at various electrodes including polycrystalline
glassy carbon, PdAu, Au, and Pd in the 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid at 150 °C are shown in Figure 1A. The voltammograms show that
the reduction of Zn(II) on the GC starts at about −0.2 V, corresponding
to the deposition of Zn, whereas the reduction process occurs at potentials
less negative than −0.2 V on the PdAu, Au, and Pd substrates,
indicating that less overpotential is required for the deposition
of Zn on the metal substrates. This fact could be a result of the
high work functions of Pd (5.2–5.6 eV) and Au (5.1–5.47
eV) in comparison to those of C (5 eV) and Zn (3.69–4.9 eV).
A larger work function difference between the substrate and the deposits
facilitates the reduction to occur. On the reverse potential sweep,
only a single anodic peak (a1) due to the stripping of
the Zn electrodeposits is observed on the GC electrode, whereas multiple
stripping peaks (a2–a4) are observed
on the metal electrodes, indicating the stripping of various surface
alloy electrodeposits that were formed between the deposited Zn and
the metal substrates. Note that the stripping peak a1 is
due to the stripping of Zn-rich alloys on the top layers of the deposits
and the stripping peaks a2–a4 resulted
from the stripping of the alloys deeper in the substrates because
a phase with a higher Pd and/or Au content would be oxidized at a
more positive potential than that with a higher Zn content. The decrease
of peak a1 and increase of peaks a2–a4 indicate the decrease of the amount of Zn deposits that remain
on the top surface of the substrate and the increase of the amount
of Zn alloys formed. In accordance with the higher atom diffusivity
of Au than that of Pd, the relative intensities of these stripping
peaks suggest that the ease of alloy formation follows the trend from
Au–Zn > (PdAu)–Zn > Pd–Zn. The temperature
effects on the formation of Zn alloys on the PdAu substrate are further
illustrated in Figure 1B, with the cyclic voltammograms recorded for the electrodeposition
and stripping of Zn on a polycrystalline PdAu substrate in the 40.0–60.0
mol % ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid at various temperatures from
90 to 150 °C. As shown, because the viscosity of the electrolyte
decreases and therefore the mass transport of the Zn(II) species to
the electrode surface increases with increasing temperature, the reduction
current increases with increasing temperature, reflecting the more
facile deposition of Zn at higher temperature. Meanwhile, the voltammogram
recorded at 90 °C shows only a single stripping peak a1, indicating that the deposited Zn does not effectively alloy with
the PdAu substrate at this temperature. When the temperature was increased
to 110 and 130 °C, peak a1 increased as more Zn was
deposited during the cathodic scan, meanwhile peak a2 also
increased because the efficiency of the (PdAu)Zn alloy formation was
increased. Moreover, substantial increase in peak a2 and
decrease in peak a1 are observed at 150 °C because
substantial amounts of the deposited Zn had alloyed with PdAu and
the relative amounts of unalloyed Zn became less. These facts indicate
that a higher temperature is necessary for the effective formation
of the (PdAu)Zn surface alloy. This can be attributed to the accelerated
interdiffusion of Zn and PdAu with increasing temperature.

Figure 1 Cyclic voltammograms
recorded in a 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid
(A) at 150 °C on (I) GC, (II) PdAu, (III) Au, and (IV) Pd electrodes
(the scan rate was 50 mV s–1) and (B) recorded at
the PdAu electrode at temperatures varied from 90 to 150 °C.

The
cyclic voltammograms that are shown in Figure 1 suggest that the electrochemical formation
of (PdAu)Zn surface alloys is possible. The electrochemical formation
of (PdAu)Zn surface was studied by the constant-potential electrodeposition
of 10 C cm–2 of Zn at −0.2 V onto the PdAu
substrate from the 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC liquid
at 150 °C. To enhance the formation of the (PdAu)Zn alloys, the
Zn-deposited samples were kept in the solution for 1 h after each
electrodeposition experiment to let the deposited Zn diffuse into
the PdAu substrate. The as-deposited samples were cleaned by washing
off the residual melt and characterized with X-ray diffraction (XRD).
Shown in Figure 2 are
the XRD patterns for the Zn-deposited PdAu samples prepared at various
temperatures. It can be seen that the XRD patterns of the samples
prepared at 90 and 110 °C show only the characteristic diffractions
due to Zn and the PdAu substrate. The absence of the diffractions
of the (PdAu)Zn alloy suggests that most of the deposited Zn remained
on the PdAu surface and no appreciable (PdAu)Zn alloy was formed.
On the other hand, when the deposition temperature is increased to
130 °C, diffractions due to the (PdAu)Zn alloy appear at 2θ
= 41.24° and 75.18°.
The intensity of the (PdAu)Zn diffractions increases with increasing
temperature while the diffractions due to Zn and PdAu decrease with
increasing temperature, indicating that the formation of (PdAu)Zn
requires a sufficient high temperature to facilitate the interdiffusion
of the deposited Zn and the PdAu substrate. It should be noted that
no significant interdiffusion of the deposited Zn and the PdAu substrate
was observed when the Zn-deposited PdAu was immersed in the melt solution
at room temperature for a time period longer than 24 h. The cyclic
voltammograms shown in Figure 1 imply that although (PdAu)Zn alloy can be formed by deposition
at −0.2 V, it is possible to dealloy the (PdAu)Zn surface alloy
by the selective anodic dissolution of Zn at 1.0 V to produce porous
PdAu. Therefore, the preparation of the porous PdAu was investigated
by the constant-potential deposition of Zn at −0.2 V to form
the (PdAu)Zn surface, followed by the dissolution of Zn from the (PdAu)Zn
at 1.0 V.

Figure 2 XRD patterns
(Cu Kα) of the PdAu samples deposited with 10 C cm–2 of Zn from the ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid at various temperatures
from 90 to 150 °C.

The effect of temperature on the morphology of the
as-produced PdAu surface is illustrated in Figure 3, with the scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
micrographs recorded for the PdAu samples prepared at various temperatures
(90, 110, 130, and 150 °C) by the deposition of 10 C cm–2 (5.18 × 10–5 mol cm–2)
Zn, followed by dissolving the deposited Zn at −1.0 V. As shown
in Figure 3A, only
shallow cracks are produced on the PdAu sample prepared at 90 °C.
The SEM image shown in Figure 3B reveals that the number and depth of the cracks increased
when the temperature was increased to 110 °C. Figure 3C shows that when the temperature
was increased to 130 °C, the width and depth of the cracks further
increased and some fine structures (such as secondary cracks) appeared
on the islands separated by the cracks. As shown in Figure 3D, when the preparation temperature
was further increased to 150 °C, dramatic morphology evolution
is observed on the PdAu sample because nanostructures composed of
ligament aggregates are apparent on the islands separated by the wide
and deep cracks. These results can be understood as the diffusion
rate of the metal atoms is slow at low temperature so that the deposited
Zn atoms do not diffuse well into the PdAu and alloying reaction does
not occur to an appreciable extent during the deposition step and
thus the diffusion of Zn atoms is unable to produce significant morphology
change during the dissolution step.
On the other hand, the interdiffusion of the metal atoms increases
with increasing temperature and more of the deposited Zn atoms could
alloy with PdAu atoms, resulting in more significant volume change
in the alloy during the deposition step, thus producing more pronounced
morphology changes, and creating a porous PdAu surface after the Zn
atoms are selectively dealloyed. Among the temperatures examined,
the temperature of 150 °C apparently gives the best morphology.
The coexistence of cracks and ligaments on the dealloyed PdAu can
be attributed to the different diffusivities of Pd and Au.42 The low diffusivity of Pd predominantly results
in the cracks, whereas the high diffusivity of Au governs the formation
of ligaments. The microstructure of porous PdAu materials produced
from dealloying of the (PdAu)Zn is dependent on the alloy composition,
which can be varied by the amount of deposited Zn. A series of porous
PdAu samples were prepared at 150 °C by the deposition of different
amounts of Zn at −0.2 V, followed by selective dealloying at
+1.0 V. The SEM images of these porous PdAu samples are shown in Figure 4. As can be seen
in Figure 4A, the (PdAu)Zn
alloy film formed is thin and no obvious changes in the surface morphology
are observed when the amount of the deposited Zn is as low as 1 C
cm–2. On the other hand, as shown in Figure 4B, cracks and pores started
to appear in the dealloyed PdAu sample that had been deposited with
a higher quantity (5 C cm–2) of Zn because the (PdAu)Zn
was thicker and higher in Zn content. Finally, Figures 4C and 3D show that
further increasing the thickness and Zn content of the (PdAu)Zn alloy
film by increasing the deposited Zn amount to 10 C cm–2 brought in a significant change in the morphology; both deep cracks
and islands made of nanometer-sized ligaments are present.

°C. The Zn-deposited samples were immersed in the solution for

cm–2 of Zn at −0.2 V and dealloyed at 1.0
V at 150 °C. The Zn-deposited samples were immersed in the solution
for 1 h before dealloying.

Porous Pd and porous Au samples were also prepared at 150
°C
by depositing 10 C cm–2 of Zn, followed by dealloying
at +1.0 V. The SEM images of the dealloyed Pd, Au, and PdAu samples
are presented in Figure 5. The SEM image shown in Figure 5A reveals that the Pd sample prepared under this condition
displays primarily rough islands separated by cracks having a width
of about 200 nm. Meanwhile, Figure 5B indicates that the Au sample surface is composed
of severely coarsened ligaments. By contrast, Figure 5C shows that fine nanostructures are obtained
with PdAu. The different morphologies can be attributed to the different
diffusivities of these materials. The low diffusivity of Pd makes
it difficult for Zn to diffuse into the Pd sample during the deposition
step and difficult for the reconstruction of the surface during the
dealloying step, leading to the cracks. Apparently, a temperature
higher than 150 °C is required for the preparation of fine porous
Pd. The high diffusivity of Au makes it easy for both the formation
of the surface AuZn alloy during the deposition step and the reconstruction
of the surface during the dealloying step. However, the high diffusivity
of Au also causes serious coarsening. It is known that nanoporous
Au composed of interconnected ligaments can be prepared at temperatures
below 120 °C.26 For the PdAu sample,
the low diffusivity of Pd minimizes the coarsening while the high
diffusivity of Au facilitates the formation of nanostructures containing
micrometer pores and nanometer ligaments during dealloying of (PdAu)Zn.
The above results indicate that the morphology of the porous PdAu
prepared by the constant-potential deposition of Zn, followed by the
selective anodic dissolution of the deposited Zn, can be manipulated
by the operating temperature and the amounts of deposited Zn. The
final morphology is also strongly affected by the diffusivity of the
metal atoms. An alternative way to prepare porous PdAu using the electrochemical
alloying/dealloying approach is by cycling the potential of the PdAu
electrode between −0.3 and 1.0 V. It is expected that Zn is
deposited on the PdAu and forms (PdAu)Zn during the cathodic potential
sweep and dealloyed from the (PdAu)Zn alloy during the anodic potential
sweep to produce porous PdAu. The multiple scan cyclic voltammograms
recorded at a scan rate of 10 mV s–1 for electrochemical
alloying/dealloying of (PdAu)Zn at 120 and 150 °C, respectively,
in the 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC melt are presented
in Figure 6. In these
voltammograms, the anodic peak a1 is attributed to the
stripping of bulk Zn deposit, whereas the anodic peak a2 is attributed to the stripping of Zn of the (PdAu)Zn.
As shown in Figure 6A, no noticeable changes are observed in the voltammogram recorded
at 120 °C; the stripping peak a1 remains higher than
the stripping peak a2, indicating that no appreciable (PdAu)Zn
was formed during the cathodic potential scan. On the other hand, Figure 6B shows obvious changes
in the voltammogram recorded at 150 °C; the anodic peak a1 decreases while the anodic peak a2 increases with
increasing cycling number, indicating the formation of (PdAu)Zn. However,
no further alteration in these voltammograms is observed when the
potential cycle number is higher than 20, suggesting that a steady
state is reached. The SEM images recorded for the PdAu samples prepared
at 120 and 150 °C, respectively, with a potential cycle number
of 30 are given in Figure 6C,D. It is apparent that the PdAu sample prepared at 150 °C
exhibits a better defined porous structure than that prepared at 120
°C. The effect of the number of potential cycles on the prepared
PdAu samples is illustrated by the SEM images shown in Figure 7. This figure clearly shows
that the PdAu nanostructures developed with increasing potential cycle
number. Although porous PdAu materials could be prepared by both constant-potential
alloying/dealloying and potential cycling approaches, their final
porous structures are different. The former approach produced porous
PdAu samples that consist of cracks and islands formed by nanoligaments,
whereas the latter approach produced porous PdAu samples that consist
of cracks and islands having small holes. This may be resulted from
the more efficient coarsening process associated with the latter approach.
Coarsening proceeded to reduce the surface energy once the alloy is
dealloyed. Because, in the potential cycling approach, there was only
a limited time for the formation of a thin (PdAu)Zn surface alloy
layer during each cathodic potential scan and only a limited porous
PdAu layer was produced during the anodic dealloying potential scan,
the coarsening process of the thin-layer nanostructure is more efficient.
Although subsequent potential scans thickened the porous PdAu layer,
the highly mobile Au content in the porous PdAu continuously promoted
the coarsening of the structure during each potential cycle, leading
to a significant increase of the PdAu “ligament” size.
Therefore, the fine structures are lost, leaving small holes.

melt. SEM images of the PdAu samples prepared at (C) 120 and (D) 150

samples prepared at 150 °C by multiple potential scan between

25, and (D) 30.

Cyclic voltammograms
recorded on the plain PdAu and porous PdAu electrodes
prepared with constant-potential alloying/dealloying (denoted as PdAuCP) and potential cycling (denoted as PdAuCV) in
a 0.1 M NaOH aqueous solution at 30 °C at a potential scan rate
of 50 mV s–1 are presented in Figure 8A. By referring to the literature,43−45 the anodic peaks a1, a2, and a3 are attributed to the oxidation
of the adsorbed hydrogen, metal hydroxide, and the formation of metal
oxides, respectively, whereas the cathodic peaks c1, c2, and c3 are due to the cathodic adsorption of
hydrogen, reduction of Pd oxide, and reduction of Au oxide, respectively.
It appears that the porous PdAuCP gives much higher peak
currents than the PdAuCV and plain PdAu. The charges integrated
from the current under the peaks c2 and c1 of
these voltammograms give a ratio following the trend of PdAuCP (19.8 mC) > PdAuCV (2.22 mC) > plain PdAu (0.32
mC). This indicates that with the same geometric area, the PdAuCP electrode exhibits an active surface area about 66 times
higher than that of the plain PdAu electrode. Therefore, the porous
PdAuCP electrode that was prepared by the constant-potential
deposition of 10 C cm–2 of Zn at −0.2 V followed
by dealloying at 1.0 V in the 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC melt at 150 °C was tested for the electrochemical detection
of glucose in aqueous solution. Typical cyclic voltammograms recorded
on the PdAuCP at 30 °C in a 0.1 M NaOH solution with
and without 20 mM glucose are shown in Figure 8B. Judging against these two voltammograms,
it is apparent that the current peak at about 0.0 V is due to the
oxidation of glucose and can be used for the detection of glucose.
The performance of the PdAuCP electrode toward the detection
of glucose was investigated using an amperometric method. The current
responses of the PdAuCP electrode at −0.08 V to
a series addition of glucose into a 1.0 M NaOH solution are shown
in Figure 9A. As illustrated
in this figure, the response current of the PdAuCP electrode
was found to increase abruptly to a steady-state value upon each addition
of glucose with a quick response time of ca. 5 s. A calibration curve
constructed for the detection of glucose using this electrode is shown
in Figure 9B. As can
be seen, the calibration curve is linear in the range of 1–14
mM glucose with a correlation coefficient of 0.999 and a sensitivity
of 2.65 mA cm–2 mM–1, indicating
that the PdAuCP prepared in this study is potentially useful
for the electro-oxidation of glucose.

The stability of the PdAuCP electrode was examined by cycling the electrode between
−1.0 and 0.8 V in a 1.0 M NaOH solution. The surface morphology
of a PdAuCP electrode and a nanoporous Au electrode after
1000 potential cycles was examined with SEM. As shown in Figure 10, the PdAuCP electrode exhibits much less changes in the morphology in
comparison with that of the nanoporous Au electrode. The less change
in the morphology of the PdAuCP electrode apparently proves
that because of the lower diffusivity of Pd, the PdAuCP is less prone to coarsening and is able to preserve its nanostructure
with respect to that of the more mobile pure porous Au during the
potential cycles. Moreover, no appreciable alteration was observed
in the cyclic voltammograms recorded on the PdAuCP after
1000 cycles, indicating that the PdAuCP electrode is more
stable.

Conclusions
The one-pot
fabrication of nanoporous PdAu films through electrochemical alloying/dealloying
was examined in a Lewis acidic ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid.
The formation of the hierarchical nanostructure is realized as a result
of the high surface diffusivity of Au, which facilitated the formation
of ligaments, and the low surface diffusivity of Pd, which prevented
the coarsening of the porous structures. The fabrication was performed
by the electrodeposition of certain amounts of Zn onto the PdAu substrate
to form the (PdAu)Zn surface alloy, followed by the selective anodic
dissolution of Zn from the surface alloy. For comparison, the preparation
of the PdAu nanostructure was also carried out by multiple scan potential
cycling. It is found that the morphology of the produced PdAu nanostructure
is greatly affected by the working temperature. A high temperature
favored alloying/dealloying but also enhanced the coarsening of the
porous structure. Moreover, the results indicated that the PdAu porous
films prepared with constant-potential electrolysis were thicker and
provide higher electrochemical active surface area than those prepared
with the multiple potential cycling. The porous PdAu films prepared
by the deposition and dissolution of 10 C cm–2 Zn
at 150 °C showed an excellent performance for the electro-oxidation
of glucose in alkaline aqueous solution.

Overall, the results
demonstrated that by taking the advantage of the high thermal stability
of the ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid, electrochemical alloying/dealloying
can be applied to the fabrication of bimetallic or multicomponent
porous materials containing less mobile metal components. It should
be pointed out that the crack-ligament-mixed morphologies resulted
from electrochemical alloying/dealloying are different from the bicontinuous
porous structure prepared from the thermal-casting alloying and chemical
dealloying methods. Because the final nanostructure is a compromise
between high-diffusive Au and low-diffusive Pd, varying the composition
of the original PdAu substrate should also affect the procedure and
the final nanostructures. It should be noted that although this work
was conducted in a glovebox, it is very likely that similar results
can be obtained when the electrochemical alloying/dealloying fabrication
of the porous materials was conducted in air. These aspects will be
further studied.

Experimental Section
EMIC (Aldrich)
was prepared and purified according to the method
described in the literature.46 A colorless
ZnCl2-EMIC (40.0–60.0 mol %) ionic liquid was prepared
by mixing proper amounts of ZnCl2 (Aldrich, 98%) and EMIC
at 90 °C for 6 h in a N2-filled glovebox (vacuum atmosphere).
The electrochemical alloying/dealloying fabrication of the porous
PdAu was conducted in the N2-filled glovebox. The electrochemical
experiments were conducted with an Autolab 302N potentiostat/galvanostat
controlled with the GPES software. A three-electrode electrochemical
cell was used for all electrochemical experiments. The counter electrode
was a Zn (Aldrich, 99.9%) spiral immersed in the pure 40.0–60.0
mol % ZnCl2-EMIC liquid contained in a fritted glass tube,
and the reference electrode was also a Zn wire (Aldrich, 99.9%) placed
in a separated fritted glass tube containing pure 60–40 mol
% ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid. For cost reason, the experiments
for the fabrication of nanostructured PdAu were conducted at PdAu
wires (Pd/Au; 40/60 wt %, Alfa Aesar, 99.9%, diameter = 0.2 mm). The
polished PdAu wire working electrode was first degreased in acetone,
followed by immersion in 2 M HNO3(aq), rinsed with deionized
water, and dried before use. To fabricate the nanostructured PdAu
electrode, (PdAu)Zn surface alloys were first formed by the electrodeposition
of Zn at the PdAu wire in the 40.0–60.0 mol % ZnCl2-EMIC ionic liquid. Zn in the (PdAu)Zn surface alloys was then anodically
stripped off to create the nanostructured surface. For comparison,
the preparation of nanostructured Pd (99.9%, 0.5 mm in diameter) wires
and Au (99.9%, 0.2 mm in diameter) wires was also conducted with the
same procedure. The microstructure of the electrode was examined with
a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (ZEISS AURIGA FE-SEM)
and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The crystalline phases of
the deposits on the PdAu wires were examined with a Shimadzu XD-D1
X-ray diffractometer.
