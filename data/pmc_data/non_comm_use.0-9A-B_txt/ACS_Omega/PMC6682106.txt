Critical cytotoxicity
evaluation of pharmaceuticals is necessary
for the clinical practice of chemotherapy. To quantitatively evaluate
cell viability, currently there are two main types of sensitive methods
including real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and CCK-8 assay, in which
RTCA records electrochemical signal changes around an incubated cell,
whereas CCK-8 is based on the colorimetric method. Despite the different
detection principles adopted for the cytotoxicity assessment, the
comparison of the two methods in terms of the application scope is
lacking. In this study, comparison studies were conducted between
the RTCA and CCK-8 assays using anticancer drugs including doxorubicin
hydrochloride, curcumin, irinotecan (CPT-11), taxol, and oxaliplatin,
which are classified into two groups of drug molecules in the absence
and presence of additives. The cytotoxicity evaluation of these drugs
on cancer cells revealed that the physicochemical properties of drug
formulations such as optical and electrochemical properties are closely
linked with the readout of cytotoxic methods. The experimental results
suggested that the preselection of cytotoxic assay is critical for
the quantitative measurement of cytotoxicity of anticancer drugs,
which is of clinical importance for their therapeutic usage.

1 Introduction
Nowadays,
with the fast development and technical breakthrough
in the pharmaceutical industry, there is an urgent need for the drug
screening and toxicity tests. Although animal experiments are required
for such purposes, the in vitro cell-based assays as a promising alternative
are becoming widely used.1 According to
the analyzed signals, cell-based assays, in principle, can be classified
into colorimetric assays,2−4 luminogenic assays,2,3 electrochemical methods,5,6 cell counting methods,2 and so forth. Among these methods, two conventional
assays are usually applied for in vitro cellular cytotoxicity evaluation
because of their easy operation and standardized readout: electrochemical
methods that record impedance related to the physiological status
of incubated cells on the gold microchips and optical methods that
measure the absorbance of cell viability-sensitive dyes in the tested
solution as typified by the real-time cell analysis (RTCA) and cell
counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, respectively.

On the basis of
dye labels, the conventional colorimetric assays
such as CCK-8 and MTT assay were historically established for the
cytotoxic evaluation of drugs7−11 because of the remarkable sensitivity and operational convenience.
By the use of highly water-soluble tetrazolium salt, CCK-8 assay exhibits
superior detection sensitivity than other tetrazolium salts-based
assays like MTT.12 In the CCK-8 measurement,
the dye of WST-8 [2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt] was reduced by dehydrogenase
in cells to form a water-soluble orange-colored product (formazan).
The amount of the produced formazan dye by cellular dehydrogenases
is correlated with the number of living cells. Therefore, the cell
viability can be simply estimated by recording the optical density
(OD) of formazan at 450 nm using a microplate reader. Although CCK-8
assay as a representative end point method allows convenient colorimetric
readout, it limits in that each measurement can be conducted at a
single time point. Additionally, when colored drugs were used, precautions
should be taken as it may cause spectroscopic interference to the
determination.

Recently, RTCA holds promising potential in cellular
assays because
of the advantages of recording signals in a dynamic and label-free
mode. In a typical run, upon cells’ incubation on the arrayed
gold microchips, the produced electrical impendence reflecting the
physiological status of cells such as cell proliferation and viability
was continuously monitored.13−22 Without the use of labeled dyes, RTCA permits a direct and continuous
measurement of cells under physiological conditions.23 Notably, as electrochemical signals were obtained, the
cell number and morphology are the only determining factors in the
RTCA assay, whereas other physicochemical properties like the spectroscopic
absorbance of cellular components exert no influences on the analysis.
Nevertheless, in the cytotoxic assay by RTCA, attention should be
paid to the drug formulations that may contain electrically conductive
additives.

Till now, there are sparse reports on the comparison
of two types
of cytotoxic methods. In this study, we have directly calculated and
compared half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50)
of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), curcumin (CCM), irinotecan (CPT-11),
taxol, and oxaliplatin from the cytotoxicity evaluations by both CCK-8
and RTCA assays.

2 Results and Discussion
First, the spectroscopic absorbance of ∼50 μg/mL tested
drug molecules in the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution was measured
on a UV–vis spectrophotometer. DOX showed the absorbance maximized
at 480 nm, whereas CCM was at 425 nm. Note that both the absorbance
peaks of DOX and CCM were close to that of formazan at 450 nm (Figure 1). CPT-11 displayed
the absorbance band around 360 nm without the observable absorbance
at 450 nm. By comparison, both taxol and oxaliplatin virtually showed
no absorbance in the wavelength range of 300–600 nm.

spectra of 50 μg/mL CCM, irinotecan hydrochloride
(CPT-11), DOX, taxol, and oxaliplatin.

To calculate IC50 of the drugs for the cytotoxicity
evaluation, cancer cells were exposed to different concentrations
of the tested drugs. We speculated that DOX and CCM with an absorbance
peak in the vicinity of that of formazan may cause spectral interference
to the analysis results. Hence, we first tested the cytotoxicity of
these two drugs. In the CCK-8 assay using HeLa cells, different concentrations
of DOX of double dilution were prepared for the cytotoxicity evaluation.
As calculated by Statistical Product and Service Solutions (SPSS),
the IC50 value was 0.311 μg/mL (Figure 2A). In RTCA, DOX of different
concentrations at 0.156, 0.312, 0.417, 0.625, 0.833, and 1.25 μg/mL
were chosen for recording the cell growth curves, and the IC50 value of 0.364 μg/mL was obtained, which is close to the result
of the CCK-8 assay (Figure 2B). As for CCM that is not water-soluble, CCM was first dissolved
in pure DMSO and then diluted with the culture medium prior to the
analysis. Note that CCM was orange-colored. To avoid the spectral
interference of CCM in the tested solution to a great extent, we have
pipetted out the CCM-added culture medium and rinsed the plate quickly
with the fresh medium before adding the CCK-8 reagent. The IC50 value of CCM obtained from the CCK-8 assay was 27.513 μg/mL
(Figure 2C) in comparison
to 10.7 μg/mL obtained from RTCA (Figure 2D), indicating a threefold difference in
the cytotoxicity results between the two methods. Despite a possible
spectral interference of both CCM and DOX, the comparison studies
between CCK-8 and RTCA suggested the amount of colored drugs is the
determining factor to cause the bias to the experimental results of
cytotoxicity assessment. In the case of DOX of relatively high pharmaceutical
effect, less amounts of drug molecules were used so that the drug
absorption into cancer cells was even less, which contributed to no
observable difference in the cytotoxicity evaluation results. As for
CCM, to achieve the anticancer effect, more drug molecules were used;
hence, virtually, a color change to the tested solution was observed
(Figure S1A). Although a further rinsing
step was applied to reduce such color interference of CCM (Figure S1B), the calculated IC50 by
CCK-8 was still largely different from that of RTCA, which may point
to the interference from the remaining drug molecules adsorbed into
the cells. To further rule out the possible interference from the
cell itself, the cytotoxicity evaluation of CCM was carried out by
the use of A549 cells. Similar to the experimental results of HeLa,
the IC50 value obtained was 24.0 and 9.61 μg/mL in
CCK-8 (Figure S2A) and RTCA assay (Figure S2B), respectively, suggesting the spectral
interference of CCM is the main factor to cause bias in the colorimetric
method. Note that the rinsing of cells with the medium inevitably
causes a loss of incubated cells (Figure S1C,D). Therefore, we concluded that the CCK-8 assay may not be suitable
for the cytotoxicity evaluation of colored drugs with a less pronounced
pharmaceutical effect. Considering that the concentrations of DMSO
were different for the gradient dilution of the CCM solution, the
cytotoxicity of DMSO was also evaluated by the CCK-8 assay, and the
concentrations chosen were in accord with those in the CCM series
(Figure 2C). Among
all the groups, over 96% cells survived after 24 h (Figure S3A), indicating that DMSO caused almost no influence.

h by CCK-8 assay; cell growth curve of HeLa induced by DOX (B) and
CCM (D) by RTCA.

In clinical applications,
the anticancer drug formulation often
contains additives. The presence of additives functions in several
aspects such as to improve the therapeutic effect, pharmacokinetics,
and stability of the main drug/drug formulations. To investigate the
possible influence of additives on the analysis results, HeLa cells
were exposed to CPT-11 of varied concentrations in RTCA and CCK-8
assays. As shown in Figure 3, the IC50 value was calculated to be 33.6 and
17.2 μg/mL by CCK-8 and RTCA, respectively (Figure 3). As there is virtually no
absorbance of CPT-11 at 450 nm of formazan used for CCK-8 assay, we
reasoned that the additives of drugs such as sorbitol, lactate, and
sodium hydroxide may cause some interference to the RTCA determination.
To test this hypothesis, the dielectric properties of CPT-11-added
cells were studied by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS)
using a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). As shown in Figure 3C, the impedance spectra of
the electrode modified with cells or drug-added cells were recorded.
The diameter of the semicircle extrapolated in the obtained Nyquist
diagram showed a correlation of electron-transfer resistance of the
redox probe on the electrode surface with the CPT-11 concentration.
At 50.0 μg/mL of CPT-11, there is a significant change of the
recorded semicircle in the Nyquist diagram. This observation suggested
that the additive in CPT-11 may alter the impedance of the drug formulation
used in RTCA. Therefore, RTCA appeared to be suitable for the cytotoxicity
evaluation of anticancer drugs without any electroactive components
or pure drug molecules.

by RTCA; (C) electrochemical impendence spectra of GCEs modified with
HeLa cells only, the cells containing 12.5 and 50.0 μg/mL CPT-11,
respectively.

As for the anticancer
drugs of taxol and oxaliplatin, both of them
showed no observable absorbance in the wavelength range of 300–600
nm. However, compared with the water-soluble oxaliplatin, taxol exhibited
poor water solubility. To test the cytotoxicity in solution, we dissolved
taxol in DMSO to make a stock solution, which was further diluted
with the medium to make a series of drug solutions to treat HeLa cells
in CCK-8 assay (Figure 4A) and RTCA (Figure 4B), respectively. The IC50 value obtained by CCK-8 was
1.08 μg/mL, which was comparable with that of 1.07 μg/mL
obtained by RTCA. The cell viability of HeLa cells after incubation
with DMSO of different concentrations for 48 h was measured by CCK-8
assay to evaluate its cytotoxicity of DMSO and influence. The concentrations
of DMSO in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
were the same with those in the solution of taxol used in the CCK-8
assay above. All the groups showed cell viability over 96% (Figure S3B), which suggested that the DMSO utilized
caused almost no interference. In the case of oxaliplatin, the tested
solution was made by directly dissolving the drug with the medium
because of its superior water solubility. The drug concentrations
of 0.781, 1.56, 3.12, 9.38, 12.5, 18.8, 25.0, 37.5, 50.0, 75.0, and
200 μg/mL were used in the CCK-8 assay (Figure 4C) and 3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0, 50.00, 100,
and 200 μg/mL in RTCA (Figure 4D), respectively. The obtained IC50 was
16.9 μg/mL in CCK-8 assay that accorded well with that of 17.1
μg/mL in RTCA. These experimental results using taxol and oxaliplatin
indicated a consistency of both the CCK-8 and RTCA methods when there
was not any spectral or dielectric interference from the tested drugs
as well as the components.

and oxaliplatin (C)
after 48 h in CCK-8 assay; cell growth curve of HeLa induced by taxol
(B) and oxaliplatin (D) in RTCA.

Considering that the value of IC50 was method-dependent,
distinct results could be obtained among different assays even as
there are no detection bias. Therefore, cell counting assays were
conducted to further validate the measured results by the CCK-8 and
RTCA assays. The IC50 value of CCM by cell counting was
13.04 μg/mL (Figure 5B) close to that of RTCA, which suggested the possible interferences
involved in the colorimetric determination. Nevertheless, in accordance
with the result of the CCK-8 assay, the value of IC50 of
CPT-11 derived from manual counting was 34.6 μg/mL (Figure 5C), which indicated
that the CCK-8 assay was relatively applicable for the cytotoxicity
evaluation of drug formulation with the excipients. Additionally,
the other IC50 values obtained by manual cell counting
assays were 0.39 μg/mL for DOX (Figure 5A), 1.01 μg/mL for taxol (Figure 5D), and 16.26 μg/mL
for oxaliplatin (Figure 5E). These results were consistent with those of both the CCK-8 and
RTCA assays, which also accord well with those reported previously.24−26 Taken together, the data obtained by manual cell counting supported
the comparison results between the CCK-8 and RTCA assays, which suggested
that the applicability of these two methods should be taken into consideration
in terms of cytotoxicity evaluation of the drugs.

3 Conclusions
In this work, we have compared
the cytotoxicity evaluation results
of several anticancer drugs between the CCK-8 and RTCA assays. The
IC50 values obtained by the two methods are outlined in Table 1. The results indicated
that the CCK-8 assay as an end point method measured the optical intensity
of dyes in the cell at a specific time point, of which the readout
interpretation can be interfered by the colored drugs used, especially
those with the absorbance peak close to 450 nm of dyes used for the
assay. By comparison, RTCA measured the drug-added cells on the basis
of electrochemical impedance and hence can give more reliable cytotoxicity
evaluation results. Nevertheless, when electroactive ingredients are
used for the drug formulation, CCK-8 may give the validated assessment
of cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs. Therefore, the comparison
results toward different samples should be based on the methodology.
In the long run, with the fast development of new drug formulation,
our studies may indicate that the preselection of methods is necessary
for the drug cytotoxicity evaluation and screening to avoid the misleading
results, which will be meaningful for later clinical practice.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Cell Culture
HeLa cells were cultured
in DMEM (Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10%
(v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, ExCell Biology) and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific). A549 cells were cultured in Roswell
Park Memorial Institute Medium 1640 (Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific)
supplemented with 10% (v/v) FBS and 1% (v/v) penicillin–streptomycin
(Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific). All the cells were incubated
at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere. Before each experiment,
the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4,
Gibco by Thermo Fisher Scientific), detached with 0.25% trypsin–ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) solution (Beyotime Biotechnology), and then centrifuged
at 1000 rpm for 5 min, followed by resuspension.

4.2 CCK-8 Assay
Cancer cells were first
counted, and approximately 4000 cells per well were seeded in a 96-well
cell culture plate (Corning Inc.). Then, after incubation at 37 °C
in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h, the culture
medium was replaced by a series of concentrations of drugs diluted
with the corresponding culture fluid. Five replicates were made for
each measurement, and the time of co-incubation was determined by
the efficiency of each drug. In this study, DOX (MedChemExpress Co.,
Ltd.) and CCM (Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co., Ltd.) were co-incubated
with the cells for 24 h at 37 °C under the same conditions as
described above, whereas irinotecan hydrochloride injection (20 mg/mL,
Qilu Pharmaceutical), taxol (Aladdin), and oxaliplatin (Aladdin) were
co-incubated for 48 h. Finally, 10 μL of the CCK-8 reagent (MedChemExpress
Ltd.) was added into each well, and OD at 450 nm was measured using
a multifunction microplate reader (Infinite M200 Pro, Tecan) after
incubation for 2 h at 37 °C. The percentage each concentration
accounted for of the control was presented as cell viability. The
IC50 value was calculated using SPSS.

4.3 Real-Time Cell Analysis
To monitor
the cellular growth and responses to the drugs, we utilized the “xCELLigence”
system (Roche Applied Sciences and ACEA Biosciences) including 16-well
E-plates for continuous and label-free detection. After setting up
the program, 50 μL of the culture medium per well was dropped
into the E-plate to plot the baseline, followed by seeding 8000 cells
in each well. The cells were placed at room temperature for 30 min
to attach to the E-plate before subsequent detection. The culture
medium was pipetted out, and a series of concentrations of the drugs
were added after a 24 h incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO2.

4.4 Cell Counting Assays
A total of 4000
HeLa cells per well were seeded in 96-well cell culture plates. After
incubation at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 for 24 h, solutions of the anticancer drugs in different
concentrations were added to the cells. After incubation for a certain
time at 37 °C, the culture medium was removed and the cells were
washed with PBS. Then, 100 μL trypsin–EDTA solution was
added to each well, followed by 3 min incubation at 37 °C until
the cells were thoroughly dissociated from the bottom of the plates.
Equal volume of fresh culture medium was added to stop the reaction,
and living cells were counted manually with a Neubauer cell counting
chamber. The survival rate of the cells was determined by comparing
the results with that of the untreated control group.

4.5 Electrochemical and Spectroscopic Measurement
EIS was
obtained using an integrated electrochemical analyzer (CHI760D,
Shanghai Chenhua Instrument Co., Ltd.). The system utilized a saturated
calomel electrode as a reference electrode, a platinum wire as an
auxiliary electrode, and a GCE as a working electrode. The GCEs were
polished with aluminum oxide nanoparticles followed by ultrasonication
in deionized water before use. 10 μL aliquots of
cells in DMEMor in DMEM containing 12.5 and 50 μg/mL irinotecan
hydrochloride respectively were then dropped on the polished
GCE and dried at room temperature overnight. The solution above
was freshly prepared with the same amount of HeLa cells before modification.
The UV–vis spectrum was obtained on a spectrophotometer (UH5300,
Hitachi). All drugs were dissolved with DMSO (Solarbio Life Sciences)
using DMSO as the blank control for calibration.
