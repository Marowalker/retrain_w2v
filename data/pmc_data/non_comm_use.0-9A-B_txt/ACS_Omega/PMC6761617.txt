Emerging
chemicals of concern (ECCs), including phthalate plasticizers,
flame retardants, and phenolic compounds, are likely present in electronic
nicotine delivery system (ENDS) replacement solutions (e-liquids)
which are often packaged, stored in, and/or can contact with, plastic,
glass, and metal materials. Developing and validating an efficient
analytical method for concurrent quantification of ECCs in e-liquids
are thus needed to inform evidence-based safety evaluation of ENDS
products. In this study, we developed and validated a “dilute-and-shoot”
method using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem
mass spectrometry to simultaneously measure organophosphate flame
retardants (OPFRs), phthalate plasticizers, and tetrabromobisphenol
A (TBBPA) in e-liquids. We analyzed samples in positive electrospray
ionization mode (ESI+) for OPFRs and phthalates and negative
ESI– for TBBPA. The method has a total runtime of
10 min. The optimized procedure was able to deliver broad dynamic
linearity ranges with coefficients of determination (R2) above 0.995, limits of detection ranging from 0.020
to 10 ng/mL, average accuracy within ±15%, and imprecision ≤
15.0% for all analytes. To our knowledge, this is the first multianalysis
method for measuring ECCs in e-liquid samples, and the validation
results show that it is sensitive, accurate, precise, and efficient.

Introduction
Electronic cigarettes are engineered to
heat a liquid solution
(hereafter called e-liquid) so that the generated aerosol can be inhaled
by the user. e-Liquids are often packaged and/or stored in plastic,
glass, and metal materials. This has raised concerns about potential
contamination of e-liquids by many emerging chemicals of concern (ECCs),1 including phthalates, organophosphate flame retardants
(OPFRs), and phenolic compounds (e.g., tetrabromobisphenol A, TBBPA),
that have been widely used as plasticizers, flame retardants, lubricants,
preservatives, antifoaming stabilizers, and surfactants in plastics,
electronics, and packaging materials because many of these chemicals
are not chemically bonded to the materials in which they are present,
and they can leach or outgas with time and use. In addition, ingredients
in e-liquids, for example, propylene glycol (PG) and/or vegetable
glycerin (VG), flavoring compounds, and nicotine can be manufactured
using materials that may contain these chemicals. Consequently, people
may be at potential health risks of being exposed to ECCs when using
electronic nicotine delivery system (ENDS) products. A number of studies
have documented that ECC exposures may lead to adverse health outcomes,
including carcinogenic activity, neurotoxicity, endocrine disruption,
and reproductive and developmental abnormalities.2−11 As a matter of fact, ECCs are often overlooked in current debates
with regard to the health impacts of e-cigarettes which are focused
on the known toxicants present in cigarettes12 that are generally reduced in e-cigarettes, such as polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons, nitrosamines, volatile organic compounds, nitrogen oxides
(NOx), CO, and metals.13−17

For this, investigation of the types and concentrations
of ECCs
in e-liquids is needed to provide scientific data for a better evaluation
of the safety of the ENDS products. Using gas chromatography (GC)–mass
spectrometry (MS), Oh and Shin developed a method for measuring diethyl
phthalate (DEP) and diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in replacement liquid.18 Several other phthalates of interest were not
included in their method. Besides, this method employed liquid–liquid
extraction which is relatively time-consuming and required a volume
of 0.5 mL for sample preparation to achieve the lowest limits of detection
(LODs) that were 0.003 and 0.004 μg/mL for DEP and DEHP, respectively.
As such, in many cases, the maximum volume of e-liquids contained
in the ENDS products may be insufficient for repeating the analysis
often required to ensure the reliability of the analytical data. Some
of the limitations have been improved in a method based on high-performance
liquid chromatography coupled with tandem MS (HPLC–MS/MS) reported
by Moldoveanu and Yerabolu.19 For example,
the sample amount was reduced to 100 mg, and six other phthalates
including dibutyl (DBP), benzyl butyl (BBP), diphenyl, di-n-octyl, diisononyl, and diisodecyl phthalates were simultaneously
measured along with DEP and DEHP. However, the LODs of the analytes
in this method were around
20 ng/mL or higher, which are not as sensitive as those described
in the method by Oh and Shin.18 Besides,
this method also required a runtime of 20 min for these compounds,
which is relatively inefficient for studies involving large sample
sizes. Current liquid chromatography technology allows a short runtime
of <10 min and is thus able to reduce the consumable costs in the
long run. “Cost-effectiveness” is usually a factor that
needs to be considered when developing analytical assays which have
a high-frequency application potential.

In this study, we aimed
to develop and validate the HPLC–MS/MS
analytical method to simultaneously measure the concentrations of
ECCs, including phthalates, OPFRs, and TBBPA, in e-liquid samples.
To our knowledge, this is the first multianalysis method for measuring
these chemicals in e-liquids with high sensitivity, accuracy, precision,
efficiency, and robustness.

Results and Discussion
Selection of “Dilute–Shoot”
and SPE Cleanup
Sample Preparation
We first optimized SPE cleanup procedures
aiming to obtain higher sensitivity. Although most of OPFRs and phthalates
are lipophilic compounds, their polarity and solubility vary in broad
ranges, resulting in a wide retention ability on SPEs. We found that
a higher percentage of methanol in washing solution (e.g., 50%) provided
cleaner samples but unfortunately also lower recoveries for some compounds
(Figure 1), including
triethyl phosphate (TEP) and dimethyl phthalate (DMP), compared to
those washed using solvents consisting of a lower methanol percentage
(15%). Choosing a solvent with a proper percentage of methanol in
water relies on several considerations. One important consideration
is the type of the sample matrix. Unlike many other types of samples,
including human samples, e-liquid samples predominantly contain PG,
VG, or both, which have minimal retention on C18. For this reason,
washing solvents with a low methanol percentage in water can still
be effective to elute PG/VG from SPE. Any PG/VG residuals in the treated
samples can be separated and directed into a waste container by the
liquid chromatography (LC) flow after injection.

Figure 1 Examination of the effects
of methanol fraction in the SPE washing
solvent on the preparation recovery.

Another important consideration is the sensitivity needed for achieving
specific research goals. Higher sensitivity is often desired for obtaining
a higher detection rate. This is important because many of the compounds
are potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) which can adversely
affect human health even at low levels.20 For this reason, we chose to use 15% of methanol in water as the
second washing solvent following the first washing step by pure water,
and we observed that this procedure can provide an average extraction
recovery of >60% for all analytes.

Using the SPE extraction
method, we also observed that LODs for
all analytes can reach ≤25 pg/mL. The enhanced sensitivity
obtained using SPE cleanup procedures would provide a large capacity
for obtaining high detection rates that are critical for accurately
examining the adverse health effects attributable to e-cigarette use
in future studies. However, we observed that SPE cleanup procedures
can also enrich or lead to elevated background residual levels for
most of the analytes, causing broad variations in analytical results,
especially for those compounds whose concentrations were <5 ng/mL.
For this reason, we chose to develop, optimize, and validate a direct
“dilute–shoot” analytical assay for the analysis
of e-liquid samples. As the “dilute–shoot” sample
preparation is carried out in one single step, it is expected that
it will be less time-consuming, and, most importantly, it can minimize
or avoid undesirable errors and deviations that are often observed
during the SPE cleanup procedures.

Matrix Ion Suppression
Optimization
Because of the
lipophilic property of most of the analytes, a high percentage of
organic phase, averagely above 50%, is required to elute them from
the HPLC C18 column. Compared to others, DEP has a relatively high
polarity and low retention on the column with a retention time of
2.6 min observed in this method (Figure 2). One major concern about matrix effects
is relevant to the PG and VG residuals resulting from sample preparation.
We observed that this can be minimized by directing the LC flow during
the first 2.2 min to a waste container. This is mainly because of
the low retention of PG and VG on the C18 column because of their
relative high polarity. This practice can also be friendly to the
mass spectrometer as PG and VG are viscous liquids with boiling points
of 188 and 290 °C, respectively. Without directing the LC flow,
the PG and VG residuals can potentially deposit and build up onto
the interior surface of the mass spectrometer detector over time,
resulting in lower MS sensitivity. We also directed the LC flow in
the last 3 min to a waste container, aiming to reduce the buildup
of other potential interferences in the MS analysis. The calculated
data show no significant matrix ion suppression occurred in the assay
(Table 1), which may
reflect the effectiveness of the LC gradient program used for minimizing
the system contamination.

a Concentrations
for the pools A,
B, C, and D are 16, 40, 100, and 250 ng/mL, respectively.

Background Residuals and Potential Carryover
We evaluated
the carryover by measuring the residual levels of each compound in
blank solvent samples analyzed following the samples with concentrations
ranging from 250 to 500 ng/mL for all analytes. We compared the average
peak area of each analyte in the first solvent blank sample with the
average peak area for the corresponding analyte in the treated samples.21−24 To differentiate the potential carryover from the system background
residual levels, multiple samples containing high-purity methanol
and water were injected and analyzed prior to analyzing the samples
with high concentration levels. In this assay, when the samples were
diluted by 10 times, we did not identify the background residual levels
for TEP, TPrP, tris(2-chloroethyl)phosphate (TCEP), dihexyl phthalate
(DHP), tris(2,3-dibromopropyl)phosphate (TDBPP), DMP, diamyl phthalate
(DAP), resorcinol bis(diphenyl phosphate) (RDP), TDBPP, and TBBPA.
However, background residuals were identified for the rest of the
compounds (Figure 3). On average, OPFRs had higher background residual levels compared
to phthalate plasticizers. We observed that the background levels
were generally decreased by increasing the dilution factor.

Figure 3 Examination
of the residual levels in blank samples analyzed prior
to and following the samples with a concentration level of 250 ng/mL.

To avoid carryover contamination, before each injection,
the injection
port was rinsed with 300 μL of the mixed solvents consisting
of 60% acetonitrile, 45% isopropanol, and 5% water, and the measuring
LC line was washed with 600 μL of 95% of acetonitrile in water
(volume-based). Comparison analyses were then performed to evaluate
the residual levels of each compound in the blank samples analyzed
prior to and following the samples with high concentration levels
(250–500 ng/mL). No significant difference was observed in
the MS responses between the two sets of blank samples, suggesting
that system background residuals were the main contamination sources.
We observed that preparing mobile buffer solutions freshly on an as-needed
basis could minimize the background levels.

The method was further
validated by determining the LOD, limit
of quantitation (LOQ), dynamic linear ranges, accuracy, and precision.
The calculated LOD and LOQ concentrations are presented in Table 2 and the overall accuracy
and imprecision are given in Table 3.

Application to e-Liquid Samples
We measured the concentrations
of ECCs for 20 refill e-liquid samples purchased from online commercial
sources and presented the blank-corrected concentration (ng/mL) for
each target analyte in Table 4. Among all analytes, DMP was detected in 80% of the samples,
followed by DBP, DEP, and BBP. TEP, 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate
(EHDPP), tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate (TDCPP), dicyclohexyl
phthalate (DCHP), tris(2-butoxyethyl)phosphate (TBOEP), tris(2-ethylhexyl)phosphate
(TEHP), diphenyl phosphate, and TCEP were detected in 10–25%
of the samples. TPrP, TBP, triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), and tris(1-chloro-2-propyl)phosphate
(TCPP) were identified in 5% of the samples. TDBPP, RDP, DEHP, and
TBBPA were not identified in the 20 e-liquid samples. We also observed
that at least one of the analytes can be detected among these e-liquid
samples and that the concentrations for certain analytes can be extremely
high in some e-liquid samples. A highest concentration of 1776 ng/mL
was observed for DBP (average: 176 ng/mL), followed by DCHP (451 ng/mL),
DMP (153 ng/mL), and TEHP (194 ng/mL). Overall, the application results
suggest that this method can be useful to quantify the emerging chemicals
of health concern in e-liquid samples in future studies, thus to address

Materials and
Methods
Reagents and Standards
LC–MS-grade solvents
(e.g., acetonitrile, water, and methanol), ammonium formate, formic
acid, and USP-grade PG and VG were bought from Fisher Scientific (Fairlawn,
NJ, USA). Native standards, including DBP, DEP, DEHP, BBP, DHP, DCHP,
DAP, DMP, TBOEP, TCEP, TCPP, tricresyl phosphate (TCP), TPhP, TDCPP,
tributyl phosphate (TnBP), TEHP, TDBPP, TEP, EHDPP, RDP, bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl)phosphate,
TBBPA, and isotope-labeled standards, including DHP-d4, DEP-d4, DBP-d4,
DMP-d4, and DCHP-d4, were purchased from AccuStandard (New Haven,
CT, USA). Isotopically labeled compounds, including TPhP-d15, TCPP-d18,
TBOEP-d27, TDCPP-d15, TEP-d15, TDBPP-d15, TBP-d27, TCEP-d12, and TPrP-d12,
were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (North York, ON, Canada).
All chemicals were directly used for preparing standard solutions,
and no further purification was performed. TruView LCMS Certified
Glass inject vials and SPE (C18, 100 mg) columns were bought from
Waters (Milford, MA, USA) and Biotage (Charlotte, NC, USA), respectively.

Standard Preparation
An internal standard (ISTD) spiking
solution, including DEP-d4, DBP-d4, DMP-d4, DHP-d4, TBP-d27, TEP-d15,
TCEP-d12, TPrP-d21, TDCPP-d15, TDBPP-d15, TPhP-d15, TCPP-d18, TDCPP-d15,
and TBOEP-d27, was prepared by mixing isotope-labeled stock solutions
and diluting them with the mixed solvents consisting of 60% methanol
and 40% water in volume, which yielded a spiking solution containing
concentrations of 25 ng/mL for each isotope-labeled compound. Primary
stock solutions and 12 working solutions, containing all target analytes
with their concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 5000 ng/mL, were prepared
by diluting the native standards with the mixed solvents consisting
of 60% of methanol and 40% of water in volume. Subsequently, 12 calibrator
solutions, with the concentrations of each native analyte ranging
from 0.001 to 500 ng/mL, were prepared by adding 50 μL of each
working solution and 50 μL of the ISTD spiking solution to 400
μL of blank PG and VG (v/v: 50:50) during sample preparation.
Unknown e-liquid samples with targeted concentrations > dynamic
linearity
ranges were diluted with appropriate dilution factors, and reprepared
and analyzed, to avoid mass spectrometer detector saturation. We used
similar procedures for preparing high (250 ng/mL), mid (50 ng/mL),
and low (16 ng/mL) quality control (QC) samples. Calibration, QC,
and ISTD spiking solutions were kept in amber glass vials and stored
at −20 °C.

Sample Preparation
For SPE cleanup
assay, first, 50
μL of the ISTD solution was added to each glass tube precleaned
with methanol. Then, 100 μL of each sample (e.g., e-liquid samples,
QC solutions, calibration standards, and batch blanks) and 850 μL
of methanol and water (v/v: 15:85) were transferred to the same tube.
After gently mixing, the samples were transferred onto the C18 cartridges,
which were precleaned and equilibrated with LC–MS-grade methanol
(1.0 mL), followed by acetonitrile (1.0 mL) and water (1.0 mL), in
order. After 10 min, the mixtures were pushed through the SPE column
(approximately 1.0 psi positive pressure). Subsequently, the SPE column
was washed with 1.0 mL of water and 1.0 mL of mixed solvents consisting
of 15% methanol and 85% water (volume-based). High-purity nitrogen
(25 psi) was then applied to dry the SPE column. After 15 min, 1.0
mL of LC–MS-grade methanol was loaded onto the SPE column,
and the eluted samples were collected in 1.5 mL LC injection vials
(“total recovery”, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) and evaporated
to dryness under high-purity nitrogen at room temperature. The evaporated
residuals were reconstituted with 100 μL of 1:1 (v/v) methanol/water
mixture. The LC injection volume for each sample in this study was
10 μL.

For the direct “dilute-and-shoot”
assay, 50 μL of the ISTD spiking solution was first added into
each LC injection vial. Then, 50 μL of each sample (e.g., e-liquid
samples, QC samples, calibration standards, and batch control blanks)
and 400 μL of the mixed solvents consisting of 60% methanol
in water (volume-based) were transferred to the same vial. After gently
vortexing, 10 μL of each sample was injected into the LC column
for analysis.

Instrumentation
The HPLC system
used in this study
consisted of a CTO-20AC column oven, a DGU-20A5R degasser, two LC-20ADXR
pumps, and a SIL-30AC autosampler (Shimadzu Corp). Chromatographic
separation was performed using a Kinetex C18 column (particle size,
2.6 μm; length, 10 cm; diameter, 2.1 mm, Phenomenex) at 40 °C.
Two tandem in-line filters (2 and 0.5 μm) were connected prior
to the LC column.

The mobile phase “A” consisted
of 5.0 mM of ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid prepared in LC–MS-grade
water, and the organic phase “B” was 100% acetonitrile.
An LC flow rate of 0.40 mL/min was used during the entire analysis.
Detailed gradient elution conditions are given in Table 5. After sample injection, the
LC flow occurring only during the period between 2.2 and 7.0 min was
directed to the mass spectrometer by the switching valve, whereas
the flow during the first 2.2 min and the last 3 min was directed
to a waste container.

A Sciex triple quadrupole 6500+ mass spectrometer with a TurboIonSpray
source (Foster City, CA, USA) was used for method development and
sample analysis. Electrospray positive mode (ESI+) was
used to acquire scheduled multipole reaction monitoring (MRM) precursor/product
transition data for OPFRs and phthalates, and negative mode (ESI–) was used for TBBPA. The MS source parameter settings
are provided in Table 6. Compound-dependent MS parameter settings were optimized manually.
MRM transitions for native analytes and ISTD are given in Table 7. Figure 2a–e shows the representative
chromatograms of all analytes included in the current method.

Data acquisition was
performed using the Analyst software (version

quantitation were performed using MultiQuant (version 3.0.3). Peak
area ratios of analytes to the corresponding ISTD for each batch with
a 1/x weighting factor were used to construct linear
least-squares regression calibration curves.

Matrix Ion Suppression
Evaluation
To evaluate the potential
matrix ion suppression, we first prepared a set of four spiking standard
solutions with concentrations of 160, 400, 1000, and 2500 ng/mL, and
then we prepared four sample pools (A–D) by adding 50 μL
of each spiking solution to 450 μL of blank PG or/and VG solvents,
yielding concentrations of 16, 40, 100, and 250 ng/mL for the four
pools A, B, C, and D, respectively. We prepared three sets of samples
in PG/VG solution with their volume ratios of 1:0, 1:1, and 0:1, respectively.
The fourth set of sample was prepared in mixed solvents consisting
of 60% methanol and 40% water (volume-based). Three replicated analyses
for each pool were performed. Following the same sample preparation
procedures, matrix ion suppression was calculated by comparing the
average peak area of each analyte in the samples prepared in PG/VG
(first to third sets) with the average peak area of the analyte prepared
in the mixed solvents: methanol/water (v/v: 60/40) (fourth set).

LODs and LOQs
We calculated the method LODs and the
LOQs for all analytes as 3 times and 10 times the standard deviation
(SD0) of the samples with zero analytic concentration,22,25 respectively. To determine SD0, we prepared and analyzed
10 pools (0.010, 0.026, 0.066, 0.164, 0.40, 1.0, 2.56, 6.40, 16, and
40 ng/mL) with low levels of targeted native analytes. For the analytes
with detectable background residual levels, we used isotope-labeled
standards to prepare the pools. We plotted the SD of each pool (Y axis) against the concentration (X axis)
and defined the Y-intercept as SD0.

Accuracy and Precision
To assess the accuracy and precision
of this assay, we spiked 50 μL of each working standard solution
(160, 400, 1000, and 2500 ng/mL), which were prepared and used for
matrix ion suppression evaluation, into 450 μL of blank PG and
VG (v/v: 50:50), yielding a set of four pools with concentrations
of 16, 40, 100, and 250 ng/mL for each analyte, respectively. We evaluated
the intra- and interday accuracies, which were calculated as a percent
of the target concentration, and imprecision, which was calculated
as the relative SD (% RSD), for each analyte with the four different
pools, following the “dilute-and-shoot” procedures described
in the “Sample Preparation”
section.

QC Measures
To ensure the reliability of the analytical
data, several QC measures were applied. All samples, including unknown
e-liquid samples, calibration standards, QCs, and laboratory control
blanks, were prepared following the same sample preparation and analysis
procedures. Calibration curves were constructed using 12 calibration
standard solutions prepared in PG/VG (v/v: 50:50) to account for the
potential matrix effects. A laboratory control blank for every 10
samples was prepared and analyzed in each analytical batch. All reportable
results are blank-corrected concentrations. Calibration curves were
regularly evaluated using certified standards purchased from a second
commercial source or lot. Instruments were also regularly maintained
to ensure high sensitivity.

Conclusions
In
this study, we first evaluated the preparation efficiency using
the SPE method and compared its performance with a simple “dilute-and-shoot”
approach for preparing e-liquid samples. As the SPE method could cause
increased background residual levels, the “dilute-and-shoot”
method was chosen for sample preparation. We then optimized and validated
HPLC–MS/MS assay to concurrently measure OPFRs, phthalate plasticizers,
and TBBPA in the prepared e-liquid samples. The validation results
indicated that this method was sensitive (LOD: 0.02–10 ng/mL),
accurate (average inter-/intraday bias, <15%), precise (average
inter-/intraday imprecision, <15%), and efficient (10 min runtime).
To our knowledge, this is the first multianalysis method for measuring
ECCs in e-liquid samples.
