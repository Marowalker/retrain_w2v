To
develop the point-of-care testing method to facilitate the clinical
detection of severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV),
colloidal gold paper-based lateral flow immunochromatography test
strips (LFITSs) have been fabricated for the rapid detection for the
first time. The pH value and the amount of monoclonal antibody to
prepare colloidal gold nanoparticle-labeled monoclonal antibody bioconjugates
were optimized. In addition, 0.4% bovine serum albumin was considered
to be the best concentration for blocking nitrocellulose membranes.
Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection for SFTSV was as
low as 1 ng/mL depending on a visual line. Meanwhile, the entire detection
process required no more than 10 min with a volume of only 50 μL
of the analyte solution. Moreover, paper-based LFITSs were evaluated
in real samples of human serum of patients with satisfactory results.
In addition, all strips were of high stability and specificity. In
the light of advantages such as simple, portable, rapid, and low cost,
the developed LFITSs will extensively come into service, especially
in remote areas.

1 Introduction
Severe
fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) caused by the
newly discovered bunyavirus is of high mortality rate in the eastern
and central regions of China in recent years.1−5 As reported,6−8 SFTS virus (SFTSV) genome is a
single negative chain RNA virus, which consists of three fragments
(L, M, and S). The L fragment encodes RNA polymerase. The M fragment
encodes envelope glycoprotein (Gn and Gc),9,10 which
has hemagglutination activity and plays a key role in the fusion of
virus and host cells. Most notably, apart from nonstructural protein
NSs, the S fragment encodes nucleocapsid proteins at the same time,
which are closely related to virus replication.11 According to the reports,1,12 SFTSV infection
contributes to sudden fever, respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms,
decreased white blood cell count, bleeding, and multiple organ failure.
To date, not only have the disease virus been separated successfully,
but also its sequences have been elucidated.13 On the other hand, research studies (e.g., etiology, epidemiology,
clinical medicine, etc.) have been carried out in recent years.13 Whereas diagnosis of SFTSV demand a robust and
complicated laboratory system making use of virus isolation, virus
nucleic acid detection, and immunological detection commonly. For
instance, quantitative ELISA detection of SFTSV had been reported,
which could detect the antigen concentration of 1 ng/mL. Unfortunately,
its applications were bounded as a result of fussy washing steps and
incubation procedures.14,15 The lack of universal test methods
for SFTSV infection is a growing awkward situation. To date, there
is no paper-based strip to rapidly detect SFTSV on the basis of colloidal
gold nanoparticles (Au NPs), where inexpensive and portable tests
can be utilized by unskilled individuals for determination.

On the other hand, extensive attention has been paid to immunoassay
in various fields, such as food safety detection,16−18 environmental
monitoring,19,20 drug detection,21 medical testing,22−24 and so on. Although a series
of specific, sensitive, and quantitative immunoassays have sprung
up and been employed, such as fluorescence,25 electrochemical luminescence,26 and electrochemistry,27 their shortcomings cannot be easily overlooked,
which are intricate and time-consuming. Thus, simple, fast, and sensitive
new-style immunochromatography technology28 seems to be more in line with personal daily requirements, which
is an indispensable component of point-of-care testing (POCT)29 and only depend on capillary force to make the
fluid migrate. As for immunochromatography technology, great attempts
have been made toward signal reporters all the time. So far, to achieve
the purpose of quantitative detection of the analyte, a number of
signal reporters were taken into account, such as latex particles,30−32 magnetic nanoparticles,33−35 upconverting luminescence,36,37 fluorescent quantum dots (QDs),38−40 and organic fluorescent
dyes.41 Among them, QDs and colloidal Au
NPs were considered as bright participants in paper-based lateral
flow immunochromatography test strips (LFITSs). In contrast with QDs
endowed with high fluorescence quantum yield and tunable emission
wavelength,42 Au NPs were also concerned
on account of the advantages of excellent stability, eye reading results,
surface modification, shape, and size-dependent optical properties.43 Furthermore, Au NPs had incomparable biocompatibility44 and a simpler process of synthesis compared
with QDs containing deleterious heavy metal ions.45,46 Therefore, paper-based LFITSs based on Au NPs are a powerful tool
for direct, rapid, and low-cost POCT via visible lines, and this technique
does not require any sophisticated specialized instruments and complex
analysis.47,48 As markers, paper-based LFITSs based on
Au NPs were first applied to detect human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).49 Afterward, paper-based LFITSs based on Au NPs
were widely applied in many fields.

In this article, by combining
the merits of paper-based LFITSs
and the singular properties of Au NPs, we presented a rapid detection
method of novel bunyavirus SFTSV for the first time. The design and
response principle of paper-based LFITSs are demonstrated in Scheme 1. The developed strips
were very simple and cost-effective for SFTSV detection, and the whole
detection process can be fulfilled easily within 10 min with satisfactory
results, revealing that LFITSs based on Au NPs have a great potential
to be used as the POCT for SFTSV detection. Taking into account the
advantage of practical value to monitoring SFTSV, the developed paper-based
strips have a great prospect, especially in routine applications.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Principle of the Method
Paper-based
LFITSs were operated on the basis of sandwich-type immunoreaction. Scheme 1 illustrated the
test principle of LFITSs, which was consistent with the previous reports.50,51 During the test, SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins primarily formed conjugates
with the Au NPs–monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and then reacted
with the test (T) line antibodies on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane
to form double antibodies sandwich complex before fixed and accumulated
visible red lines to the naked eye. The unreacted bioconjugates continued
to move by chromatography and incorporated into goat antimouse IgG
at the control (C) line, resulting in the visible red line. Thus,
a red T line representing the test of SFTSV virus was positive, whereas
a T line that did not display red was considered to be negative. Last
but not least, red C lines indicated that paper-based LFITS were effective.
If C lines did not display red, no matter what the result of T lines
were, it would indicate that LFITSs were invalid and the test results
were meaningless (Scheme 2A). The presence of target proteins was judged by the specific
color tracer of colloidal gold particles. The test results were read
directly by visual method within 10 min. As shown in Scheme 2B, only the C line showed red
color in the absence of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins, indicating that
the background signal was very weak and the test result was valid.
On the other hand, paper-based LFITSs assembled in cassettes displayed
two red lines to detect 1 μg/mL of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins.

2.2 Characterization
of Au NPs
Figure 1A showed maximum
visible absorption wavelength of Au NPs, which was at 521 nm in conformity
with the literature,52 and a narrow peak
shape also showed that the particles had homogeneous particle. The
morphology and dispersion of Au NPs were characterized by typical
transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As showed in Figure 1B, it can be observed that
Au NPs had a good uniformity and dispersion, and the inset showed
that the average particle size was 20 nm.

of Au NPs. (B) TEM image of Au NPs. (C)
SEM image of the test line of paper-based LFITS detecting (C) without
and (D) with 1 μg/mL SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins; the white
spots represented Au NPs.

T lines were characterized by scanning electron microscopy
(SEM)
to visualize the morphology under different concentrations of SFTSV
nucleocapsid protein antigen. In Figure 1C, Au NPs were hardly observed in the T line,
when SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins were absent (0 ng/mL). A weak background
signal indicated that the nonspecific adsorption was low. Nevertheless, Figure 1D showed that it
was obvious to observe Au NPs, explaining that a large number of bioconjugates
were captured because of 1 μg/mL of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins.
Therefore, the presence of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins can be distinguished
by the naked eye.

2.3 Optimization of the LFITSs
The performance
of Au NPs on paper-based LFITSs would be affected by certain parameters,
such as the properties of Au NPs–mAbs under different pHs,
the mixture ratio between Au NPs and antibodies, different types of
NC membranes, and the concentration of bovine serum albumin (BSA)
solution applied to the NC membranes. According to the literature,53,54 when the pH gets close to the isoelectric point of antibodies, ionic
and hydrophobic interactions bring about the stronger physical adsorption
of antibodies onto the surface of Au NPs, which are negatively charged
in the alkaline environment. The effect of mAbs labeled to the Au
NPs under a series of pH (6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0, and 10.0) was first
investigated. Figure S1A displayed changes
in color under different pHs, where the response to PBS was determined
in parallel as the control. Under the destructive effect of high concentration
of salt, the color of Au NPs–mAbs solution under pH values
less than 7.0 altered from red to blue because of its accumulation.
On the other hand, when the pH values were more than 7.0, there was
no change in the color of the solution. Hence, the optimal pH value
was ascertained at 8.0, which was considered as a full stabilization
of bioconjugates solution.

Next, to increase the sensitivity
of the detection, mAbs levels labeled Au NPs were optimized by the
salt tolerance. A series of antibody solutions (0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6,
2.0, 2.4, 3, 4, 5, and 6 μg) were added into Au NP solutions
under the optimal pH value. In Figure S1B, the high concentration of salt directly induced accumulation, which
could be observed by a color shift from red to blue at 0.4 μg
of mAbs. However, Au NP solution containing 0.8 μg of mAbs could
remain red after reacting with NaCl solution. Furthermore, according
to previous reports,60 beneficial for a
better stabilization of Au NPs, the concentration of selected mAbs
should be more than the above mAb concentration. Consequently, 1.2
μg of MAbs for the conjugation was taken into consideration.

In addition, employed as important solid supports of test strips,
different types of NC membranes influenced the sensitivity of the
tests. In this study, three frequently used NC membranes, including
Sartorius CN140, Vivid 170, Millipore 135, were investigated. The
results indicated that the velocities of liquid under the same experimental
conditions were not very different. As shown in Figure 2A–C, T and C lines remained remarkable
with low background. To detect SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins, the detection
limit based on Sartorius CN140 and Vivid 170 was 0.5 μg/mL and
80 ng/mL, respectively. Notably, Millipore 135 had a better performance
as low as 40 ng/mL. Hence, it was chosen the best suitable membrane
to assemble lateral strips.

types of membranes
for the detection of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins in PBS solutions:
(A) Sartorius CN140, (B) Vivid 170, and (C) Millipore 135.

The block of NC membranes was another crucial factor
affecting
the performance of paper-based LFITSs. Many researchers have emphasized
the benefits of BSA for membrane blocking. As previously reported,55−58 treated with a certain concentration of BSA, NC membranes have the
effects of slowing down the speed of flow, increasing signal, abating
nonspecific binding, and increasing stability. Different concentrations
of BSA solution (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 3, and 5%) were applied
to block NC membranes of LFITSs, which were used to detect the antigen
of 1 and 2 μg/mL. In the course of the experiment, PBS was detected
as the control. Figure 3 displayed T lines of all LFITSs that turned red. Furthermore, chromatography
of the solution suffered from severe flow resistance because of high
concentrations of the blocking buffer. As a result, the flow rate
was too slow to make T and C lines of paper-based LFITSs take at least
30 min to produce color. On the basis of the experimental results,
0.4% BSA was employed for the following experiments.

Figure 3 Photos of paper-based
LFITSs blocked by different concentrations
of BSA solution to detect SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins of 1 and 2 μg/mL,
respectively.

2.4 Specificity
and Stability of Paper-Based LFITSs
To prevent the false-positive
phenomenon from cross reaction and
detect the presence of SFTSV quickly and accurately, it is of great
importance to assess the specificity of paper-based LFITSs. Here,
five different antigens were studied: HCG, AFP, CEA, CA125, and SFTSV
antigens. As shown in Figure 4, a standard solution of 1 μg/mL for each antigen was
applied to LFITSs and PBS was served as the control. There was no
significant change in the color intensity of T lines except SFTSV
antigens. These results stated clearly that paper-based LFITSs were
specific for the detection of SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins. For other
antigens, there was no cross reactivity even though their concentrations
were high.

HCG antigen, AFP antigen, CEA antigen, CA125 antigen, and SFTSV antigen.
All concentrations were 1 μg/mL.

To further evaluate the stability and reproducibility, paper-based
LFITSs were applied to detect SFTSV nucleocapsid proteins via using
a standard solution (0, 1, and 2 μg/mL) because of their importance
to the application of the product. All paper-based LFITSs were divided
into three groups and stored at room temperature (RT) for a period
(1, 2, and 3 weeks). The results in Table S1 revealed no differences in the intensity of T lines after incubation
at different times by the naked eye. Consistent results were obtained
for other concentrations. Each concentration was detected for ten
times. In addition, the strips could remain functional under storage
conditions within 6 months at RT because of the inexistence of false
positive and weak signals. The above results showed that the developed
paper-based strips have a good stability and detection performance.

2.5 Analytical Performance of Paper-Based LFITSs
The purpose of the study is to establish a rapid method for the
detection of SFTSV by the naked eye. To evaluate the practicability
of LFITSs, 50 μL of serials of antigen standards (2, 1, 0.5,
0.1 μg/mL; 80, 60, 40, 20, 10, 1, 0.1, 0 ng/mL) in PBS buffer
(pH 7.4, 10 mM) were first detected by paper-based LFITSs with each
concentration being confirmed in triplicate. After 10 min, as shown
in Figure 5A,B, red
C lines have proved the validity of the test results. From 0.5 to
2 μg/mL, T lines were so obvious that we could immediately give
a yes/no answer. Among the whole process, the color of T lines showed
a downward trend on account of gradually reduced SFTSV nucleocapsid
proteins. In addition, the color was hard to be distinguished under
low concentrations. Hence, the detection limit for detecting SFTSV
nucleocapsid proteins was 1 ng/mL, and 1 μg/mL was deemed as
visualized optimal antigen concentration. In comparison with ELISA
kits, the minimum antigen concentrations detected by strips were similar.
This fast detection strips were superior to complex ELISA detection
method. The rapid detection of SFTSV with high sensitivity has a great
prospect for POCT in daily life.

the detection of SFTSV nucleocapsid
proteins in PBS solutions (A) in cassettes and (B) outside.

2.6 Analysis
of SFTSV in Human Serum by Paper-Based
LFITSs
To evaluate the practicability for daily application,
paper-based LFITSs were also applied to detect six positive serums
of patients infected with SFTSV, where normal human serum was assessed
as the control. Assay results are listed in Table 1, which were identical with the polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) method. Also, photos of real-sample analysis
(Figure S2) were obvious to the presented
results. All results indicated that our developed LFITSs would be
helpful in the daily application with accurate results.

3 Conclusions
To sum up, we have designed rapid paper-based
LFITSs based on colloidal
gold to detect SFTSV. By using the specific binding between antigen
and antibody and the capillary action, the proposed strips have a
quick, sensitive, and high selective response to SFTSV nucleocapsid
proteins. In addition, the whole analysis can be completed within
10 min without complex analysis, professional personnel, or expensive
equipment. Also, the diagnosis of disease in outdoors and remote areas
can also be achieved. In comparison with the previously reported SFTSV
ELISA kit, this is the first use of a strip as the sensing platform
to detect SFTSV with satisfactory results. The developed method could
open up a new possibility for POCT to be widely used in daily life.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials and Chemicals
SFTSV nucleocapsid
proteins and SFTSV mAbs were provided from Jiangsu Center for Disease
Control and Prevention (simple preparation process of antibody is
shown in the Supporting Information). Goat
antimouse IgG was obtained from Shanghai JieYi Biotechnology Co. Ltd.
(Shanghai, China). Serums of patients infected with SFTSV and normal
human serums were obtained from Jiangsu Province Hospital. Sample
pads, conjugate pads (Ahlstrom 8964), NC membranes (Sartorius CN140,
Vivid 170, Millipore 135), absorbent pads, and polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) baseboards were supplied by Shanghai JieYi Biotechnology Co.
Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Other chemicals are shown in the Supporting Information.

4.2 Instruments
All photos of Au NPs
and paper-based LFITSs were taken by a telephone digital camera. Data
of serum detection using the PCR method were provided by Jiangsu Province
Hospital. In addition, other instruments are shown in the Supporting Information.

4.3 Synthesis
of Colloidal Au NPs
The
preparation of Au NPs with a diameter of ∼20 nm was carried
out according to the reported methods with appropriate modifications.30,59,60 The detailed synthesis procedures
are presented in the Supporting Information. The size of Au NPs was determined by TEM.

4.4 Preparation
of Colloidal Au NP-Labeled mAbs
Bioconjugates (Au NP–mAbs)
According to previous literature
studies,61,62 prior to experiments, the optimal pH value
and mAbs were ascertained, which were pivotal factors affecting the
stability of bioconjugates. The pH of the solution was adjusted by
adding K2CO3. Briefly, a series of different
volumes of 0.1 M K2CO3 were added to the centrifuge
tubes containing 200 μL of Au NPs. Subsequently, 4 μg
of mAbs was added into above mixtures and incubated for 10 min at
RT. Then, 45 μL of 10% NaCl was added to each tube before being
mixed uniformly and placed statically for another 2 h. Finally, changes
in the color of solutions were directly observed. Similarly, the least
amount of mAbs to stabilize Au NPs solution was determined by varying
the amounts of antibodies in the reaction system.

Under optimal
conditions, Au NPs–mAbs bioconjugates were prepared as previously
reported.1 First, 1.2 μg of mAbs
was added into Au NPs solution, whose pH was adjusted to 8 under gentle
mixing uniformly. After being stirred slightly for another 30 min
at RT, the final solution was mixed with 25 μL of 5% (w/v) BSA
and stirred for another 30 min for blocking. Then, the products were
collected by centrifuging at 1500 rpm for 20 min to remove large-particle
impurity, followed by centrifuging at 15 000 rpm for another
20 min. Finally, the obtained products were redispersed in 250 μL
of 10 mM PBS (pH 7.4) containing 5% sucrose and 1% BSA for further
use.

4.5 Development of LFITSs
A schematic
diagram of paper-based LFITSs is presented in Scheme S1. The assembly of the strip was described previously.28,63,64 A paper-based LFITS was composed
of four sections, including a sample pad (10 × 4 mm), a conjugate
pad (8 × 4 mm), an NC membrane (20 × 4 mm) and an absorbent
pad (10 × 4 mm). Sample pads were used for dropping SFTSV nucleocapsid
proteins, whereas conjugate pads were applied to load bioconjugates.
Using a double-headed marker pen (SJ001, Shenzhen stationery store)
equipped with an extremely small nib (SJ002, 1.97 × 34 mm, Shenzhen
stationery store), the test line and the control line of NC membranes
were prepared by dispensing 2.5 mg/mL of SFTSV mAbs and 2.5 mg/mL
of goat antimouse IgG, respectively. The interval between two lines
was 5 mm. NC membranes were processed with the treatment solution,
which was made up of PBS (10 mM, pH 7.4) containing 1% (w/v) BSA before
being blocked and dried at 37 °C for 10 min. All parts were attached
to a PVC backing card. Before assembly, the pretreatments of some
elements are presented in the Supporting Information. Finally, paper-based LFITSs, which were cut into a 4 mm width using
a scissors, were stored in a sealed bag at 4 °C until use. The
developed paper-based strips could be easily fabricated in batch.
In the process of the experiment, an NC membrane can produce 60 devices
simultaneously at a cost of US $ 0.07 each.

4.6 Test
Procedures
When SFTSV nucleocapsid
protein standard solution (50 μL) was added onto the sample
pad of paper-based LFITS, it transferred toward the absorbent pad
under the action of the capillary force. The presence of target proteins
was judged by the specific color tracer of Au NPs. The test results
were visible to the naked eye within 10 min.
