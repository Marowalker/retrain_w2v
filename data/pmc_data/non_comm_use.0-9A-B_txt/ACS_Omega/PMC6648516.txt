The nonenzymatic
deamidation reactions of asparagine (Asn) and
glutamine (Gln) residues in proteins are associated with protein turnover
and age-related diseases. The reactions are also believed to provide
a molecular clock for biological processes. Although Gln deamidation
is assumed to occur through the glutarimide intermediate, the mechanisms
for this are unclear because under normal physiological conditions,
Gln deamidation occurs relatively less frequently and at a lower rate
than Asn deamidation. We investigate the mechanisms underlying glutarimide
formation from Gln residues, which proceeds in two steps (cyclization
and deammoniation) catalyzed by phosphate and carbonate. We also compare
these reactions with noncatalytic mechanisms and water-catalyzed mechanisms.
The calculations were performed on the model compound Ace–Gln–Nme
(Ace = acetyl, Nme = methylamino) using the density functional theory
with the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Our results suggest that
all the catalysts used in our study can mediate the proton relays
required for glutarimide formation. We further determined that the
calculated activation barriers of the reactions catalyzed by phosphate
ions (115 kJ mol–1) and carbonate ions (112 kJ mol–1) are sufficiently low for the reactions to occur
under normal physiological conditions. We also show that nucleophilic
enhancement of Nme nitrogen is essential for the cyclization of Gln
residues.

Introduction
The deamidation reactions
of asparagine (Asn) and glutamine (Gln)
residues are nonenzymatic post-translational modifications of proteins
that occur under normal physiological conditions. The introduction
of negatively charged residues by deamidation results in structural
changes and aggregation of proteins.1−4 Some of these deamidated proteins are targeted
for degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway.4,5 By regulating the protein turnover,4−9 Asn/Gln deamidation behaves like a molecular clock involved in the
timing of biological processes. In addition, deamidation reactions
are involved in aging processes. For example, the deamidation of eye
lens crystallin results in denaturation and aggregation, wherein the
formed insoluble crystallin causes cataracts.10−13 In addition, deamidation of residues
in the complementarity-determining region of therapeutic antibodies
alters the binding affinity and specificity of the antibodies for
the target antigen, causing unexpected degradation14−16 of the antibody.
Peptide drugs are assumed to be impaired by deamidation. Therefore,
a better understanding of the deamidation mechanisms can be used to
devise ways of (i) better controlling the quality of antibodies and
the usefulness of peptide drugs, (ii) better understanding processes
that promote physiological development, and (iii) clarifying pathogenic
mechanisms that promote some diseases.

Asn deamidation has been
observed to occur in several proteins
such as in ribonuclease and phenylalanine hydroxylase.7−9,17,18 The deamidation of Gln appears to occur less frequently than that
of Asn. Gln is also detected in very long-lived proteins such as crystallins
in eye lenses.4,10,13 Experimental studies using model peptides indicate that the deamidation
rates of Gln are much slower than those of Asn.19 For example, the average rate constant for Asn with a following
(N + 1) glycine residue (Gly) peptide deamidation
is 7.037 × 1012 s–1, whereas the
rate constant for Gln–Gly peptide deamidation under the same
conditions is 1.216 × 1010 s–1 (i.e.,
the deamidation of Asn is about 580 times more rapid than that of
Gln). The Asn deamidation rate in a peptide with any following (N + 1) residues (except for proline residue) is also >20-fold
faster than Gln deamidation.19 Asn deamidation
is believed to proceed via the formation of a five-membered succinimide
ring intermediate, generated by a nucleophilic attack of peptide-bond
nitrogen of the following (N + 1) residue to the
amide carbon of the side chain. Then, the succinimide intermediate
is converted to an α-/β-aspartate residue (Asp) via hydrolysis.20−22 It is presumed that Gln deamidation occurs via a mechanism similar
to Asn deamidation, wherein the deamidation proceeds through the six-membered
glutarimide ring intermediate, which then generates the α-/γ-glutamate
residue (Glu) (Scheme 1). Although γ-Glu has been detected in experimental studies
in vitro using model peptides and the results were consistent with
the presumed deamidation mechanism23,24 Gln deamidation
studies are limited to peptide-level studies because of the infrequency
of Gln deamidation in vivo. In addition, atomic- or molecular-level
studies for the Gln deamidation mechanism have not yet been conducted,
and there have been no adequate studies of catalytic molecules involved
in Gln deamidation.

Scheme 1 Glutarimide-Mediated Deamidation Pathway of Glutamine
Residues
In this paper, we
focus on the formation of glutarimide from Gln
residues to better understand the Gln deamidation pathway. Recently,
mechanisms involving the formation of succinimide from Asn have been
investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations of
Asn-histidine model compounds and NGR-containing cyclic peptide.25−27 These papers indicate that succinimide formation occurs in two steps
(cyclization and deammoniation) via the tetrahedral intermediate gem-hydroxylamine. Therefore, in this study, we assume that
the formation of glutarimide from Gln also proceeds via the cyclization
and deammoniation steps through the gem-hydroxylamine
intermediate (Scheme 2). The nucleophilic attack on the amide carbon of the side chain
by the amide nitrogen of the main chain results in an intermediate
containing the gem-hydroxylamine moiety. The deammoniation
step then proceeds in this moiety via a proton transfer. To investigate
this pathway, we used the DFT method, which has been used in previous
studies to understand nonenzymatic reactions.25−31 Because the surface exposure of Gln and Asn is a major factor determining
deamidation rates,10 we assume that various
small molecules surrounding Gln may act as catalysts for deamidation
in vivo. In particular, we know that buffer anions strongly affect
Gln deamidation rates.32−34 Therefore, we included water molecules, phosphate
ions, and carbonate ions in our calculations to evaluate the effect
of these potential catalysts. We also performed the calculation of
deamidation without any catalysts. These potential catalyst molecules
are highly abundant in vivo and play a key role in several biological
processes (e.g., pH homeostasis, enzyme activity, and regulation of
urine volume). Our study intends not only to indicate the mechanism
involved in Gln deamidation but also to determine the importance of
these potential catalyst molecules in the post-translational modification
of proteins.

Scheme 2 Two-Step Glutarimide Formation Pathway of Glutamine
Residues
Results and Discussion
We investigated the mechanisms of Gln deamidation, which proceeds
via cyclization and deammoniation steps. To evaluate the effects of
catalysts on the activation barrier and the mechanisms of Gln deamidation,
we examined four types of catalysts in this reaction system: no catalytic
molecules, two water molecules, an H2PO4– ion, and an HCO3– ion.
Phosphate ions exist mainly as HPO42– (pKa 7.21), whereas H2PO4– is one-fifth of total phosphate ions at
physiological pH; however, the H2PO4– ion can act as either a Lewis acid or a base. Furthermore, recent
studies suggest that the H2PO4– ion is an important catalyst for nonenzymatic post-translational
modifications.28,29,32 Likewise, carbonate ions exist mainly as HCO3– (pKa 10.25) and are assumed to catalyze
deamidation because it can be a Lewis acid or base. Therefore, H2PO4– and HCO3– ions are considered suitable catalysts for Gln deamidation.
Here, we compare these reactions with noncatalytic and water-catalyzed
mechanisms.

Cyclization Step
The optimized geometries of phosphate-catalyzed
and carbonate-catalyzed reactions (pathways A and B, respectively)
for cyclization steps are shown in Figures 1 and 2. In the noncatalytic
and water-catalyzed reactions (pathways C and D, respectively), the
optimized geometries are shown in Figures S1 and S2. Many calculations for complexes with different catalyst
orientations were performed; however, the calculations did not converge
except as illustrated in these figures. In the optimized geometry
for the reactant complex in pathway A (R-A), two hydrogen bonds were
observed between Gln and the H2PO4– ion (at 1.71 and 1.77 Å, respectively). In the cyclization
step, a proton was transferred from the Nme nitrogen atom to the phosphate
ion at an early stage to enhance the nucleophilicity of the Nme nitrogen,
and the transfer completed in the transition state (TS) of cyclization
(TS-A1) (Figure 1).
Following this proton transfer, another proton then shifted from the
phosphate ion to the amide oxygen. The distance between the Nme nitrogen
and the amide carbon of the side chain decreased from 3.30 to 2.07
Å, whereas the C–N distance in the cyclic intermediate
(INT-A1) was 1.54 Å after the double proton transfers have been
completed. Therefore, the phosphate-catalyzed cyclization step is
initiated by the enhancement of Nme nitrogen nucleophilicity via proton
transfer, wherein the Nme nitrogen nucleophilically attacks the amide
carbon of the side chain. In the reaction step from R-A to TS-A1,
the largest dihedral angle change was ψ (40.9°)
in the conversion from R-A to TS-A1 (Table S1). Therefore, a large conformational change of the main chain is
required for the cyclization reaction. In pathways B, C, and D, the
cyclization step progressed by almost the same mechanisms as in pathway
A. Thus, the enhancement of Nme nitrogen nucleophilicity occurs at
an early stage and results in the progress of the cyclization steps
in all pathways. A large conformational change was observed in pathways
A, B, and D (Tables S1, S2, and S4); however,
the change of the dihedral angle ψ in pathway
B (36.9°) was slightly smaller than that in pathways A (40.9°)
and D (42.5°). Therefore, the proceeding of pathways A, B, and
D may be affected by the structural flexibility of the main chain.
Although a large conformational change of the main chain was not required
for pathway C and that of the side chain was accompanied by a noncatalytic
reaction (Table S3).

Deammoniation Step
In the second step of the deammoniation
reaction, the reaction proceeds from the intermediate INT-2 of each
pathway (Figures 3, 4, S3, and S4). In INT-A2,
the conformation of the gem-hydroxylamine moiety
and the location of the H2PO4– ion differ from those in the INT-A1 intermediate. Because phosphate
ions are abundantly present in a physiological environment, this rearrangement
of the H2PO4– ion is expected
to occur without a high energy barrier. INT-A2 is the predicted reactant
complex of the deammoniation step. The gem-hydroxylamine
nitrogen and OH hydrogen form hydrogen bonds with the H2PO4– ion (1.77 and 1.63 Å, respectively).
From the INT-A2, the deammoniation step was initiated by two proton
transfers between the hydrogen-bonded atoms. In the TS of the deammoniation
step (TS-A2) (Figure 3), each proton transfer did not complete, but the distance between
the gem-hydroxylamine nitrogen and proton (1.11 Å)
was shorter than that between oxygen and proton (1.21 Å). This
result and our IRC calculation suggested that the proton transfer
between the NH2 nitrogen and the H2PO4– ion occurred first, and the transfer between
the OH oxygen and the H2PO4– ion occurred a little later. In the TS-A2, the C–N distance
in the gem-hydroxylamine moiety stretched slightly
(by 0.09 Å) from the C–N distance in INT-A2. The product
complex (P-A) was formed when the proton transfer was completed and
ammonia was released (with a C–N distance of 4.91 Å).
The sequence of proton transfer by HCO3– differed from the phosphate-catalyzed reaction. The abstraction
of the hydrogen atom from the OH of gem-hydroxylamine
by the HCO3– ion occurs first, and then
another proton shifts from HCO3– to the
nitrogen of gem-hydroxylamine. This is mostly due
to the difference in the tendency of ions to form. That is, the HCO3– ion reluctantly transfers its hydrogen
atom to nitrogen (due to the instability of CO32– at neutral pH), whereas H2PO4– easily converts to HPO42–. The dihedral
angles φ, ψ, χ1, and χ2 remain almost unchanged through the deammoniation step of pathway
A (Table S5); hence, a large conformational
change is unnecessary for this step to occur in the phosphate-catalyzed
reaction. As with this pathway, the deammoniation step of carbonate-catalyzed,
noncatalytic, and water-catalyzed reactions can occur without a large
conformational change because each dihedral angle change was <10°
in this step (Tables S6–S8).

Energy Profiles
The energy profile for phosphate-catalyzed
deamidation differs from those for noncatalytic and water-catalyzed
reactions (Figures 5 and S5). The barrier height of the cyclization
step in the phosphate-catalyzed reaction (115 kJ mol–1) was significantly higher than that of the deammoniation step (89
kJ mol–1). Therefore, the activation barrier of
the cyclization step is considered to be the rate-determining step.
According to experimental data in the literature, Gln deamidation
is slower than Asn deamidation,19 with
reported values of activation energies for Asn deamidation ranging
from 80 to 100 kJ mol–1.20,36 Therefore, the activation barrier calculated in this study is considered
to be reasonable. Although the phosphate-catalyzed deamidation of
Gln is very slow, it can proceed at normal physiological temperatures.
In pathway B, the rate-determining step is same as in pathway A, that
is, the cyclization step, and the activation barrier was 112 kJ mol–1 (Figure 5). Therefore, carbonate ions may play an important role in
Gln deamidation, similar to phosphate ions. On the other hand, in
pathway C, the barrier height for deammoniation (204 kJ mol–1) was higher than that for cyclization (179 kJ mol–1). The deammoniation step is considered to be the rate-determining
step in the noncatalytic reactions. In pathway D, the barrier heights
of deammoniation (131 kJ mol–1) and cyclization
(134 kJ mol–1) were almost the same. Owing to the
large amount of water available in vivo, the water-catalyzed deamidation
of Gln can proceed under normal physiological conditions, even though
the activation energy is high.

Conclusions
In
this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the formation
of glutarimide from glutamine residues, which proceed through cyclization
and deammoniation. For our calculations, three types of small catalyst
molecules were included in the reactant complexes. The gem-hydroxylamine intermediates were generated by the cyclization reaction.
Then, proton transferred on the gem-hydroxylamine
led to deammoniation. All the catalysts used in this study mediated
the proton transfers. Although these catalysts abstract the Nme proton
similarly at an early stage of the cyclization step, we observed a
difference in the proton relay in the deammoniation step. In the structural
change of the main chain, the dihedral angle ψ changed considerably throughout the reactions, especially in the
water-catalyzed cyclization, where the difference in ψ angles before and after the reaction was 42.5°. In the noncatalytic
reaction, the alteration of χ1,
which is one of the dihedral angles of the side chain, was the largest
changed (63.5°). In contrast to Gln deamidation, larger dihedral
angle changes are needed for Glu stereoinversion (ψ: 65°; χ2: 113°)30 and Asp stereoinversion (φ: 167°; ψ: 166°; χ: 114°).29 Therefore, a large conformational
change may not be necessary for Gln deamidation to occur, and the
deamidation can occur on a more rigid structure of protein than with
stereoinversion. In fact, deamidated Gln has not only been detected
in residues located in loop structures but has also been detected
in residues forming secondary structures.10 Although Gln120 of γS-crystallin forms an α-helix, approximately
60% of this residue in age-related cataracts is deamidated. The frequency
at which deamidation of Gln120 occurs is higher than the frequency
of Gln63 and Gln92, which are also located in loop structures. Therefore,
we assume that the accessibility of the catalyst is more important
than its structural flexibility.

The calculated activation barriers
for deamidation were sufficiently
low for reactions to occur under normal physiological conditions.
However, the barriers are higher in Gln than in Asp stereoinversions
catalyzed by phosphate ions (100 kJ mol–1).35 In addition, the activation barrier for Asn
deamidation is 108 kJ mol–1 when catalyzed
by glycolic acid, 84 kJ mol–1 when catalyzed
by the N + 1 His residue, and 91 kJ mol–1 when catalyzed by phosphate.25−27 Therefore,
the activation barrier for Gln deamidation is relatively high, and
this helps explain that the deamidation is detected from mainly very
long-lived proteins. In a previous study, the water molecule-mediated
mechanisms of cytosine and guanine deamination, in which the reactions
proceed via gem-hydroxylamine intermediate, were computationally analyzed.37−40 Although multiple pathways were investigated in these studies, the
same pathways as in the present study were included (NH3 is released after the proton transfers of the NH2 nitrogen–catalyst
and OH oxygen–catalyst). The possibilities of NH3 formation after it is released as NH4+ or
NH2– were also reported.37−40 In addition, the deamidation rate of Gln is affected by the bulkiness
of adjacent residues. For example, deamidation is accelerated when
the N + 1 residues are glycine or cysteine residues.19 Furthermore, the ionization state of catalysts
may affect the mechanisms of Gln deamidation. For example, OH– ions are thought to easily abstract Nme hydrogen to
enhance the nucleophilicity of the Nme nitrogen. In addition, the
direct hydrolysis of Gln is catalyzed by OH–/H2O.41 Therefore, additional studies
are needed to help clarify the influence of ionization states of catalysts
and adjacent residues.

In a previous study, phosphate intake
was reported to be involved
in an acceleration of aging,42 but carbonate
was not implicated. Our study suggests that the carbonate ion is related
to the nonenzymatic, post-translational modification of proteins.
Therefore, regulation of the carbonate-ion concentration in cells
may also be important in affecting age-related diseases. The concentration
of carbonate ions in cells is adjusted to maintain pH homeostasis
and by carbonic anhydrase, which is involved in the control of intraocular
pressure and urinary volume.43,44 In addition, changes
in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide by respiration and acidosis/alkalosis
may control carbonate concentrations. Therefore, the computational
results of this study are expected to be useful for investigating
the relationships between age-related diseases and inorganic ions.

Computational
Methods
The model compound used in this study was an l-Gln residue
capped with acetyl (Ace) and methylamino (Nme) groups on the N- and
C-termini, respectively (i.e., Ace-Gln-Nme) (Figure 6). This figure shows the dihedral angles φ (C–N–Cα–C) and ψ (N–Cα–C–N), which characterize
the main-chain conformation, and χ1 (N–Cα–Cβ–Cγ) and χ2 (Cα–Cβ–Cγ–Cδ),
which characterize the side-chain conformation. All calculations were
performed using Gaussian 16 software.45 The φ (C–N–Cα–C)
and ψ (N–Cα–C–N)
dihedral angles characterize the main-chain conformation of the Gln
residue, whereas the χ1 (N–Cα–Cβ–Cγ)
and χ2 (Cα–Cβ–Cγ–Cδ)
dihedral angles comprise the side chain of the Gln residue. The energy-minimum
and TS geometries were optimized without any constraints by DFT calculations
using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory in the polarizable continuum
model. Because the activation barriers for nonenzymatic amino acid
reactions were successfully calculated using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p)
level of theory,25−31,35 this is considered to be reasonable
for calculations of Gln deamidation. In addition, for simple comparison
with the results of previous studies, the same level of theory as
those studies was used. We performed vibrational frequency calculations
for all the optimized geometries to confirm them as energy-minimum
geometries (with no imaginary frequency) or TS geometries (with a
single imaginary frequency) and to obtain the relative energies for
the zero-point energy. We performed intrinsic reaction coordinate
(IRC) calculations to confirm the energy minima connected with each
TS.
