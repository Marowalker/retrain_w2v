Core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67- and ZIF-67@ZIF-8-based zeolitic
imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) were synthesized solvothermally using
a seed-mediated methodology. Transmission electron microscopy–energy-dispersive
X-ray spectrometry, line scan, elemental mapping, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
analyses were performed to confirm the formation of a core–shell
structure with the controlled Co/Zn elemental composition of ∼0.50
for both the core–shell ZIFs. The synthesized core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks conferred enhanced H2 (2.03 and 1.69 wt %) storage properties at 77 K and 1 bar,
which are ca. 41 and 18%, respectively, higher than that of the parent
ZIF-8. Notably, the distinctly remarkable H2 storage properties
shown by both the core–shell ZIFs over the bimetallic Co/Zn-ZIF
and the physical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 clearly evidenced their
unique structural properties (confinement of porosity) and elemental
heterogeneity due to the core–shell morphology of the outperforming
core–shell ZIFs. Moreover, H2 adsorption isotherm
data of these frameworks are best fitted with the Langmuir model (R2 ≥ 0.9999). Along with the remarkably
enhanced H2 storage capacities, the core–shell ZIFs
also displayed an improved CO2 capture behavior. Hence,
we demonstrated here that the controlled structural features endorsed
by the rationally designed porous materials may find high potential
in H2 storage applications.

Introduction
In the present scenario
of increasing world population, demand
and consumption of natural energy resources (fossil fuels and gases)
increase day by day, causing their rapid depletion. Hence, to meet
the global demand in an environmentally benign way is to explore for
new sustainable and clean energy resources such as H2-based
fuels.1−3 To achieve these objectives, the recent development
of porous crystalline materials attracted wide attention for H2 storage. Among the most high-performing porous materials,
metal organic frameworks (MOFs) generated great attention because
of their exceptional physical and chemical characteristics such as
high specific surface area, large porosity, and excellent thermal
and chemical stability in various environments.4,5 In
this context, one of the widely explored MOFs is zeolitic imidazolate
frameworks (ZIFs), as they find various advanced properties for diverse
applications in energy storage, gas adsorption and separation, catalysis,
and so on.6−19 In the recent past, a wide range of chemically distinct ZIFs were
investigated, in which ZIF-8 [Zn(Hmim)2] and ZIF-67 [Co(Hmim)2] frameworks have been extensively explored.6,7,12,20,21 For gas storage applications over ZIFs,
various strategies are explored to effectively fine-tune the morphology
and topology of the ZIF structure. In this context, functionalization
of organic linkers or post modification (composites) over single-metal
ZIFs has been widely investigated, albeit with limited results.6−9,13−19,22−25 Among several strategies, mixed
metals or bimetallic MOFs designed by introducing new secondary metal
ions/clusters into single-metal MOFs have been identified as one of
the most facile routes to construct new materials with tuned properties.
For instance, Botas et al. for the first time experimentally reported
in situ substitution of Zn2+ ions in IRMOF-1 (MOF-5) by
Co2+ (Co/Zn ≤ 1:4) and achieved higher adsorption
capacities of H2, CO2, and CH4 at
a high pressure (up to 10 bar), where incorporation of Co2+ was expected to provide more assessable sites to gas molecules from
unexposed metal sites.26 Kuang et al. synthesized
Co-doped ZnO (Zn1–xCoxO, x = 0.03, 0.05, and 0.10) for
the development of diluted magnetic semiconductors.27 Yamauchi et al. used a bimetallic ZIF (Cox·Zn1–x(MeIm)2) as a template for the synthesis of highly porous carbon materials.28 Recently, we have also synthesized highly robust
bimetallic CoxZn100–x-ZIF-8 (x = 25, 50, and 75 and 90%),
where Co75Zn25-ZIF-8 displayed superior H2 and CO2 uptakes at 77 and 298 K, respectively,
at 1 bar. We demonstrated that by varying the Co/Zn content in the
bimetallic Co/Zn-ZIF, chemical heterogeneity and porosity can be fine-tuned
and hence excellent gas uptake can be achieved.29 Very recently, Verpoort et al. also reported similar bimetallic
Zn/Co ZIFs for gas (N2, CO2, and CH4) sorption applications and catalytic conversion of CO2 to cyclic carbonates.30 These recent
findings displayed that bimetallic ZIFs possess improved physical
and chemical properties compared to single-metal ZIFs, and therefore
it is obvious to understand why these bimetallic ZIFs are being extensively
explored for wide applications, including as potential materials for
enhanced gas storage.26−30 Despite these encouraging findings, there are several considerable
challenges for the development and utilization of such bimetallic
materials, as appropriately discussed by Xu et al., such as fragile
yields of the framework, segregation of metals, and unpredicted topologies
and functionalities of bimetallic MOFs for advanced applications in
gas storage and separation.31

In
contrary to bimetallic MOFs, core–shell MOFs have shown
considerably high potential to overcome some of the above-highlighted
challenges;31 for instance, intrinsic structural
components of the participating MOFs remain intact and well-understood
for core–shell MOFs. Therefore, construction of such core–shell
MOFs could be an effective alternative way to tune or introduce new
fascinating properties in MOFs32 and consequently
to improve their performance for various advanced applications, in
particular for gas storage and separation. Earlier reports in this
direction demonstrated the potential of core–shell MOFs for
wide applications.32−39 Rosi et al. reported a porous bio-MOF-11/14@bio-MOF-14 framework,
which exhibited an enhanced CO2 uptake (58.3 cm3 g–1) compared to the parent bio-MOF-14 (44.8 cm3 g–1).33 Facile
construction of IRMOF-3@MOF-5 and MOF-5@IRMOF-3@MOF-5 and their reversed
structures with a similar topology were also reported.34 Szilágyi et al. described the synthesis
of IRMOF-2@MOF-5 and Janus MOF-5@IRMOF-2 and vice versa and explored
these MOFs for H2 uptake (up to 25 bar).35 Yamauchi et al. also constructed ZIF-8@ZIF-67 frameworks
and utilized these frameworks as a template to synthesize functionalized
nanoporous hybrid carbon materials for electrochemical analysis.36 A similar ZIF-67@ZIF-8 framework was reported
by Li et al., which was transformed into Pd@H–Zn/Co-ZIF to
achieve an enhanced catalytic activity for semihydrogenation of acetylene.37 Feng et al. described a new approach, instead
of seed-mediated growth, for the construction of multilayered core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67@ZIF-8 structures. They demonstrated
that under controlled slow nucleation process, double-layered core–shell
of ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks with a thick shell can
be synthesized at room temperature.38 Core–shell
MIL-101@UiO-66 was also reported to show a significant enhancement
in H2 uptake (26 and 60%, as compared to the parent MIL-101
and UiO-66, respectively).39 Although core–shell
MOFs displayed significantly improved properties than the parent MOFs,
surprisingly, application of core–shell ZIF@ZIF was not explored
extensively for gas storage applications.

Herein, we synthesized
core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8
frameworks by a seed-mediated growth method while keeping a Co-to-Zn
molar ratio of ∼0.50 for both the core–shell structures.
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images, TEM–energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDXS)
line scanning, and elemental mapping were performed to establish the
core–shell structures, whereas X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy
(ICP-AES) analyses confirmed the electronic state and the molar composition
of Zn and Co elements in the core–shell ZIFs. Core–shell
ZIFs possess unprecedented tuned framework properties (surface area,
pore volume, and pore size distribution). Remarkably, enhanced H2 storage properties were achieved over the core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks, which are significantly
higher than those of the parent ZIF-8. The obtained experimental data
were fitted well with the Langmuir adsorption equilibrium isotherm
model. Moreover, the core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8
frameworks also displayed improved CO2 capture properties
compared to either of the parent ZIFs. To the best of our knowledge,
the observed impressive H2 storage and improved CO2 capture are amongst the best reported till date, within the
analogous class of core–shell ZIFs.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis
and Morphology Characteristics of Core–Shell
ZIFs
Core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks
were synthesized by a seed-mediated growth methodology under solvothermal
conditions, as illustrated in Figure 1a. Freshly prepared ZIF-67 seeds and commercially available
ZIF-8 (Basolite Z1200) were used as seeds for the synthesis of core–shell
ZIF-67@ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67 frameworks, respectively.36,37 A visible color change from pale white for ZIF-8 to off-violet and
dark violet for core–shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8 and ZIF-8@ZIF-67 frameworks,
respectively, has also been observed during the synthesis of these
core–shell ZIFs (Figure S1). The
UV–vis absorption spectra (Figure 1b) well supported the formation of core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks, where the presence of characteristic
bands for the tetrahedral Co2+ at ∼580 and ∼540
nm with no significant shift, compared to that of the parent ZIF-67,
suggests the presence of Co2+ in the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8
frameworks.29,37,40 Notably, the analogous isoreticular sodalite topology and similar
unit cell parameters for ZIF-8 (a = b = c = 16.9910 Å) and ZIF-67 (a = b = c = 16.9589 Å) and
comparable ionic radii of Zn2+ (0.74 Å) and Co2+ (0.72 Å) drive the facile synthesis of the core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks with a topology analogous
to those of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67.9,12,20,27,29

Figure 1c
illustrates
the PXRD patterns of the synthesized core–shell ZIFs along
with those of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 (Figure S2). The presence of high-intensity peaks in the PXRD spectra
is in good agreement with the highly crystalline nature of the synthesized
core–shell ZIFs.36−38 Diffraction peaks appeared at
2θ values of 7.52, 10.53, 12.90, 14.86, 16.60, 18.21, 22.21,
24.66, and 26.82° were identified for the (011), (002), (112),
(002), (013), (222), (114), (233), and (134) planes, respectively.29 The PXRD characteristics of the parent ZIF-8
(Basolite Z1200) resemble well the earlier reported PXRD patterns
of Basolite Z1200 (Figures 1c and S3).41 Notably, no additional phase was found, and the close resemblance
of the PXRD diffraction peaks of the core–shell ZIFs with those
of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 suggests that the intrinsic framework
properties of the participating ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 remain intact during
the formation of the core–shell ZIFs.9,12,20,21,29 Moreover, the PXRD pattern of the physical mixture
of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 also showed diffractions peaks analogous to those
of the parent ZIFs (Figure 1c). The TEM and SEM images established a well-defined rhombic
dodecahedron topology with a uniform size distribution independently
for both the core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks
(Figures 2a,e and S4). TEM–EDXS, line scan, and elemental
mapping analyses further confirmed the composition and distribution
of Zn and Co elements within the core–shell ZIFs (Figures 2b–d,f–h
and S5). Distribution of Zn in the core
and Co at the shell in ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and analogously Co in the core
and Zn at the shell in ZIF-67@ZIF-8 clearly evidenced the core–shell
frameworks of the synthesized ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks.36−38 Despite the fact that ZIF-67@ZIF-8 has a larger particle size than
ZIF-8@ZIF-67, the core-to-shell thickness ratio was observed to be
comparable for both the core–shell ZIFs (Table S1).

and
(c,d,g,h) elemental mapping of (a–d) ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and (e–h)
ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks.

Moreover, ICP-AES analysis also authenticated the comparable
Co-to-Zn
molar ratio for both core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 (Co/Zn = 0.51)
and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 (Co/Zn = 0.54). XPS analysis was performed to establish
the electronic states of Co and Zn elements present in the core–shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks (Figures 3a,d, S6, and S7 and Table S2). The high-resolution spectra
of Zn 2p (∼1021 eV) and Co 2p (∼781 eV) were in good
agreement with those of the Zn2+ and Co2+ oxidation
states (Figure 3b,c,e,f).
Moreover, the signals corresponding to Co2+ appeared to
be of low intensity, suggesting the presence of Co (ZIF-67) in the
core of ZIF-67@ZIF-8. Analogously, for ZIF-8@ZIF-67, the signals for
Zn2+ were found to be of lower intensity because of the
encapsulation of ZIF-8 in the ZIF-67 shell.27,37 The N 1s peak at ∼399 eV was assigned to the N atom of the
2-methylimidazole linker (Figures S6d and S7d). Moreover, an elemental analysis also confirms that almost similar
wt % of C ≈ 48, N ≈ 23, and H ≈ 5.5 are present
in ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 (Figure S8). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) vibration bands
for ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 showed characteristics bands at
∼2929 and ∼1581 cm–1 assigned to the
C–H and C=N banding vibrations, respectively, suggesting
that the 2-methylimidazole linker remains intact during the formation
of the core–shell ZIFs. Notably, the presence of a vibration
band at ∼421 cm–1 corresponding to the Zn–N
or Co–N bond stretching demonstrated the presence of Zn-imidazolate/Co-imidazolate
linkage in the core–shell ZIFs (Figure S9).37 Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) curves of the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks along
with those of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 are shown in Figure S10. The TGA curves of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67
match well with the earlier reports.9,12,20,21,29,36,37 Interestingly, core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 were
thermally stable up to 370 and 340 °C, respectively, which is
analogous to that of ZIF-67 (390 °C) but lower than that of ZIF-8
(410 °C). These results evidenced the presence of heterogeneity
in the studied core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks.33,36,37

XPS spectra showing Zn 2p and Co 2p core bands of ZIF-8, ZIF-67, ZIF-8@ZIF-67,
and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks.

The surface area, total pore volume, and pore size distribution
of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 and the physical
mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 frameworks were analyzed by measuring
the N2 adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K,
where all studied ZIFs displayed type-I isotherm (Figures 4a and S11 and Table 1). The pore size distributions were calculated by density functional
theory (DFT) and Barrett–Joyner–Halenda (BJH) methods,
as shown in Figures 4b and S12. It is also observed that the
estimated average pore sizes of the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 (∼ca. 1.20
nm), ZIF-67@ZIF-8 (∼ca. 1.02 nm), and ZIF-8 + ZIF-67 (∼ca.
1.03 nm) frameworks are almost similar to those of the parent ZIF-8
(∼ca. 1.11 nm) and ZIF-67 (∼ca. 1.01 nm).9,10,12,20,21,29,36,37 Notably, the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area (1402.15 m2 g–1) and
total pore volume of the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 framework structure showed an
increment by ca. ∼6% (5.93%) and ca. ∼15% (14.66%),
respectively, as compared to the parent ZIF-8. Such enhancement may
be due to the well-grown ZIF-67 shell over the ZIF-8 core, without
intercepting the pores of ZIF-8. In contrary, ZIF-67@ZIF-8 showed
a lower BET surface area (1271.82 m2 g–1) and total pore volume, ca. ∼8.65 and ∼ca. 7%, respectively,
lower than those of the ZIF-67 core, presumably because of the blockage
of the pore at the interface of the ZIF-8 shell and the ZIF-67 core.
The BET surface area (1295.64 m2 g–1)
and total pore volume (0.6871 cm3 g–1) of the physical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 frameworks were almost
similar to the average values of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67. Hence,
the above results clearly evidenced the distinct surface and porosity
behavior of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8, due to
their core–shell topology, compared to the parent ZIF-8 and
ZIF-67 and the ZIF-8 + ZIF-67 physical mixture. The close agreement
of the observed trend in the pore volume and pore size of the core–shell
ZIFs with that of the respective core inferred the predominant role
of the core in controlling the growth of the shell in accordance with
the crystal lattice of the core.32,33

H2 Storage Properties
Envisioned by the
remarkably enhanced surface properties of the core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67
and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks, we explored the H2 storage
capacities of these frameworks. The H2 adsorption isotherms
were obtained at 77 and 298 K, respectively, in the pressure range
of 0–1.0 bar (Figures 5a–d and S13 and Table 1). Interestingly,
the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks displayed enhanced H2 storage capacities of 2.03 and 1.69 wt %, respectively, compared
to the parent ZIF-8 (1.43 wt %) and ZIF-67 (1.53 wt %) at 77 K. Between
both the studied core–shell ZIFs, the ZIF-8@ZIF-67 framework
outperformed ZIF-67@ZIF-8 and showed a remarkable enhancement in the
H2 storage capacity by 41.95% than the core ZIF-8 and 32.68%
more H2 storage capacity than the shell ZIF-67. Interestingly,
the surface area of the core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 is almost analogous
to that of the shell ZIF-67, whereas it is only 5.93% higher than
that of the core ZIF-8. Notably, ZIF-67 having a surface area analogous
to that of ZIF-8@ZIF-67 exhibited much lower H2 storage
properties, suggesting that presumably the porous ZIF-67 shell complemented
well with the core ZIF-8 to facilitate the observed enhancement in
the H2 storage for core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67. In contrary,
the other core–shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8 exhibited a lower H2 storage than core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and only 10–18%
higher H2 storage than the core ZIF-67 and shell ZIF-8,
suggesting that the shell ZIF-8 significantly prevented the H2 uptake by the core. Moreover, the core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67
exhibited a distinctly enhanced H2 storage even at the
low pressure range of 0.025–0.4 bar, suggesting an efficient
and rapid interaction of H2 molecules with the micro–mesoporous
surface of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 (Figure 5c). Further, it was also noted that the H2 adsorption isotherm was not saturated within the investigated
pressure range up to 1 bar (Figure 5d), suggesting that higher H2 storage can
be possible at a high pressure. Notably, ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8
exhibited very low H2 uptake values of 0.084 and 0.043
wt %, respectively, at 298 K up to 1 bar; nevertheless, the trend
is consistent with that observed at 77 K (Figures 5 and S13). It
should be noted that in general, MOFs exhibited a low H2 uptake at 298 K even at a high pressure; for instance, Yildirim
et al. reported 0.13 wt % over ZIF-8 at 30 bar; and therefore, at
a low pressure and 298 K, there will be more uncertainty in the estimated
H2 uptake values.42a

(b) comparative H2 storage, and (c,d) enlarged view of
the H2 storage isotherm in the pressure range of (c) 0.025–0.4
bar and (d) 0.80–1.0 bar.

Further, to validate if the observed H2 storage
performance
of the core–shell ZIFs is due to the structural modification
due to their core–shell morphology, the H2 storage
performance of the physical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 (Co/Zn = 0.50)
was also evaluated. It should be noted that the physical properties
of the ZIF-8 + ZIF-67 physical mixture were found to be the average
of those of the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, and hence a similar trend
was also expected for the H2 storage properties of the
ZIF-8 + ZIF-67 physical mixture. This was indeed the case, as the
H2 storage of the physical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67
(1.55 wt %) was found to be well below that of the high-performing
core–shell frameworks (2.03 wt % for ZIF-8@ZIF-67) and is almost
an average of those of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67. A similar behavior has also
been observed by Rosi et al., where the core–shell II-bio-MOF-14
exhibited a 4-fold lower N2 gas adsorption compared to
the grinded II-bio-MOF-14, which was attributed to the exposure of
the core to the N2 gas upon grinding.33 This further elaborated the advantage with the core–shell
morphology, where the gas must pass through the shell before filling
into the core.33 Notably, the observed
H2 storage capacity of the core–shell ZIFs was also
found to be higher than that of the bimetallic Co75Zn25-ZIF-8 (1.55 wt %) and comparable to those of most of the
similar class of MOFs (Table S3).29,31 The H2 storage capacities were on the order of ZIF-8@ZIF-67
> ZIF-67@ZIF-8 > ZIF-8 + ZIF-67 > ZIF-67 > ZIF-8 (Table 1). Hence, the above
observations
clearly evidenced that the special arrangement of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67
in the core–shell topology is responsible for the observed
increment in the H2 adsorption properties of the studied
core–shell ZIFs and not just because of the mere presence of
the individual components (ZIF-8 and ZIF-67). Notably, no visible
changes in the diffraction patterns were observed in the PXRD patterns
of the core–shell ZIFs before and after gas adsorption, suggesting
that their core–shell structures remain intact (Figure S14). Moreover, to know the adsorption
behavior of H2 molecules, Langmuir and Freundlich equations
(Figures 5a and S15–S17 and Table S4) were applied to fit the experimental H2 adsorption
isotherms of ZIF-8@ZIF-67, ZIF-67@ZIF-8, ZIF-8, and ZIF-67 frameworks.
The fitting parameters and represented correlation coefficients (R2) inferred a good agreement of the experimental
isotherm with the Langmuir model (R2 ≥
0.9999) compared to the Freundlich model, suggesting that the H2 adsorption behavior of the studied core–shell frameworks
adopts the theoretically expected model.43,44 Moreover, the estimated heat of adsorption (ΔHads) values were found to be ∼3.45 and ∼3.40
kJ/mol, respectively, for ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8. Notably,
the obtained ΔHads values were estimated
over a large temperature difference (77–298 K) range and a
low pressure range (0–1 bar) and therefore may led to an uncertainty
in the estimated ΔHads values. Nevertheless,
the estimated ΔHads values are in
good agreement with the other literature findings (∼4.3 and
∼3.8 kJ/mol for MIL-101(Cr) and Li@AC-MIL-101-A, respectively,
and ∼4.8 kJ/mol for ZIF-8).42

CO2 Capture Properties
Encouraged by the
observed noteworthy enhancement in H2 storage capacities
of the studied core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks,
the performance of these core–shell ZIFs was also explored
for CO2 capture capacities at 298 K and 1 bar (Figure S18 and Tables S5 and S6). All ZIFs displayed a linear increase in the CO2 adsorption capacities with the increase in pressure (0–1.0
bar). Consistent with the advancement in the surface and porosity
properties of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 over the ZIF-67@ZIF-8
frameworks and the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67, a 2-fold increment in
CO2 capture capacities to 1.67 mmol g–1 (7.35 wt %) was observed for core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 as compared
to the core ZIF-8 (0.83 mmol g–1, 3.65 wt %) and
shell ZIF-67 (1.11 mmol g–1, 4.91 wt %). Analogously,
the other core–shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8 also exhibited 18.54% more
CO2 capture than the core ZIF-67 and 59.45% more CO2 capture than the shell ZIF-8. Nevertheless, the studied core–shell
ZIFs exhibited CO2 capture capacities comparable or even
superior to most of the bimetallic ZIFs or MOFs at 1 bar and 298 K
(Table S7). Hence, the easily tunable structure
of the core–shell frameworks by the critically chosen core
and the shell materials and exploiting the complementary integration
of the core to the shell, along with the other crucial factors such
as surface functionalities, optimum porosity structure, interaction
between gas molecules and pore wall, and the chemical heterogeneity
of the core–shell frameworks, have a vital role in determining
the applications of such materials in various fields including H2 storage and CO2 capture.29,32−39,45−49

Conclusions
We demonstrated a facile
synthesis of core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67
and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 frameworks through a seed-mediated growth methodology.
TEM, SEM, elemental mapping and line scan, PXRD, and XPS authenticated
the core–shell topology of the studied ZIFs. ICP-AES analyses
further evidenced an analogous Co-to-Zn composition for both the core–shell
ZIFs. The observed remarkable enhancement in the H2 storage
properties of the core–shell ZIFs compared to either of the
parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 clearly evidenced the coherent synergy between
the core and the shell, along with the tuned porosity (surface area
and pore volume) behavior of the synthesized core–shell ZIFs.
Further, the poor H2 storage properties of the physical
mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 authenticated the crucial role of the
core–shell morphology in achieving enhanced H2 storage.
Additionally, the synthesized core–shell ZIFs displayed improved
CO2 capture properties compared to ZIF-8 and ZIF-67. The
observed unprecedented advanced properties displayed by the core–shell
ZIFs for gas storage applications may present an opportunity to design
new core–shell MOFs to achieve enhanced gas storage properties
and several other advanced applications.

Preparation of Core–Shell
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 Framework
The core–shell framework of
ZIF-8@ZIF-67 was fabricated via
adopting the seed-mediated growth method (Figure 1a) as followed by Yamauchi et al. with minor
modifications.36 In this work, commercially
available Basolite Z1200 seeds (known as ZIF-8 purchased from Sigma-Aldrich)
were utilized as the seed. Initially, 0.160 g of ZIF-8 seeds was dissolved
in 20 mL of methanol under ultrasound for 20 min at ambient temperature.
CoCl2·6H2O (0.354 g) and 1.790 g of 2-methylimidazole
were separately dissolved in 6 mL of methanol solution. After forming
a uniform solution of CoCl2·6H2O and 2-methylimidazole
in methanol, the solution was stepwise injected into the core solution.
Then, the mixture was stirred for another 20 min and transferred to
a 50 mL Teflon-lined autoclave. The mixture was heated at 373 K for
12 h. The autoclave was allowed to cool to ambient temperature. The
resultant ZIF-8@ZIF-67 solid was collected by centrifugation at 8000
rpm for 15 min. The obtained solid residue was washed several times
with methanol, collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min,
and dried under vacuum at 373 K overnight. Typical elemental analysis
showed the following composition: C: 47.88 wt %; H: 5.49 wt %; and
N: 22.64 wt %.

Preparation of Core–Shell ZIF-67@ZIF-8
Framework
The ZIF-67@ZIF-8 core–shell framework was
prepared according
to the earlier reported seed-mediated growth method (Figure 1a) by Li et al. with minor
changes.37 Initially, a homogenous methanolic
solution of CoCl2·6H2O (1.092 g in 15 mL
of methanol) and 2-methylimidazole (1.232 g in 30 mL of methanol)
was prepared under ultrasonication for 2 min at 313 K. In the next
step, a methanolic solution of Zn(NO3)2·6H2O (1.116 g in 15 mL of methanol) was stepwise injected into
the above-prepared core solution. Then, the mixture was ultrasonicated
for 20 min at ambient temperature. Finally, the resultant solid of
ZIF-67@ZIF-8 was collected via centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min.
The solid residue was washed several times with methanol, collected
by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min, and dried under vacuum at
373 K overnight. Typical elemental analysis showed the following composition:
C: 47.86 wt %; H: 5.39 wt %; and N: 22.73 wt %.

Preparation
of ZIF-67 Framework
ZIF-67 [Co(Hmim)2] was synthesized
according to the previously reported procedure
of Yamauchi et al.36 CoCl2·6H2O (519 mg), 2630 mg of 2-methylimidazole, and 600 mg of PVP
were first well-dispersed in 80 mL of methanol under stirring for
30 min at ambient temperature. Then, the reaction mixture was kept
at ambient temperature for overnight. A bright purple mixture of ZIF-67
was collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 15 min. The obtained
solid residue was washed several times with methanol, collected by
centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min, and dried under vacuum at 373
K overnight.

Preparation of Physical Mixture of ZIF-8
and ZIF-67 Frameworks
A physical mixture of ZIF-8 and ZIF-67
was prepared by mixing the
commercially available ZIF-8 and synthesized ZIF-67 in a Co/Zn molar
ratio of 0.50 to meet results of ICP-AES analysis for ZIF-8@ZIF-67
(Co/Zn = 0.51) and ZIF-67@ZIF-8 (Co/Zn = 0.54). The physical mixture
was further dried under vacuum at 373 K overnight.

Material Characterization
The PXRD pattern for the
samples was obtained using a Rigaku SmartLab automated X-ray diffractometer
system with monochromatic Cu Kα1 radiation (λ
= 1.540593 Å) at 40 kV and 30 mA. The diffraction angle was in
the range of 5–40° with a scan speed of 3° per min
and a scan step size 0.01°. TGA was carried out using a Mettler
Toledo TGA/DSC1 instrument; approximately 8 mg of the samples was
heated at a rate of 5 °C min–1 from room temperature
to 800 °C. The morphology of the sample was characterized using
a Carl Zeiss Supra-55 scanning electron microscope at an accelerating
voltage of 5 kV. TEM (FEG-TEM) and EDXS measurements were carried
out with the help of a JEOL instrument (JEM-2100F) at an operating
voltage of 200 kV. Elemental mapping and line scan analysis were performed
on an FEI Tecnai G2 F30 TEM with an operating voltage of 200 kV. The
sample prepared for analysis was dispersed into methanol under ultrasound
for 30 min. Then, the well-dispersed sample was spread over a carbon-coated
Cu grid and dried at room temperature. ICP-AES technique was utilized
to estimate the metal ion at a low level. ICP-AES analysis was conducted
with the help of an ARCONS instrument, which synchronizes the ICP
spectrometer (SPECTRO, Analytical Instruments GmbH, Germany) to the
system. For the estimation of Zn2+ and Co2+ metal
ions, the sample was digested into 20 mL of aqua regia solution. UV–vis
spectra studies were performed on an Agilent Cary 60 spectrophotometer
in the wavelength range 200–800 nm. The XPS analysis technique
measured the electronic state of the elements present in a core–shell
framework structure. XPS analysis was conducted with the help of an
AXIS supra (Make: Kratos Analytical, UK) instrument. For XPS analysis,
pellets of small size were made with the help of a mechanical press.
The framework structure was dried at 393 K for 8 h under vacuum conditions
before performing XPS measurement. Initially, a wide scan of survey
spectrum was carried out at a pass energy of 160 eV and a resolution
of 2 eV for the core–shell structure. To probe the electronic
state of the main elements (Zn2+ and Co2+),
a high-resolution scan was performed at a pass energy of 20 and a
resolution of 0.5 eV. The functional groups of the core–shell
frameworks were identified by FT-IR using instruments of PerkinElmer
Spectrum Version 10.5.1 in the 400–3000 cm–1 range of wavenumber. The samples were dried under vacuum conditions
at 120 °C for 12 h before the FT-IR measurement. The elemental
analysis of the core–shell framework was obtained using a Thermo
Scientific analyzer. The N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm of the samples was measured using a Qunatachrom Autosorb-iQ
automated volumetric sorption instrument at 77 K. The BET and Langmuir
surface areas were calculated in the relative pressure range of 0.05–0.25.
The total pore volume was measured at the point P/P0 = 0.99 using the N2 adsorption–desorption
isotherm data. The pore size distribution was estimated based on the
NLDFT and BJH theory. The sample was outgassed at 393 K for 12 h under
ultrahigh vacuum conditions before each measurement.

Evaluation
of H2 Storage and CO2 Capture
Performance
The H2 storage and CO2 capture
adsorption isotherms for core–shell ZIF-8@ZIF-67 and ZIF-67@ZIF-8
along with the parent ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 and the physical mixture of
ZIF-8 and ZIF-67 were measured using the static volumetric technique
by an apparatus from Qunatachrome Autosorb-iQ. The low-pressure (up
to 1 bar) H2 gas adsorption isotherm was measured at 77
and 298 K, and CO2 gas adsorption isotherm data were collected
at 298 K. Before the gas adsorption measurements, the samples were
dried at 393 K under vacuum for 12 h.
