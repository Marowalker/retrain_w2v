Gallium
nitride (GaN) nanowires anchored on the surface of cost-effective
pencil graphite electrodes (PGEs) have been developed as a new disposable
nitric oxide (NO) sensor through a hydrothermal method followed by
annealing treatment. The as-obtained nanomaterials were examined by
field emission scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy,
and EIS. Concurrently, the electrocatalytic performance has been analyzed
using cyclic voltammetry and amperometric measurements. The experimental
results exhibit good electrochemical sensing performance toward the
generated NO in NO2– with a wide linear
detection range of 1.0 μM to 1.0 mM with a correlation coefficient
of 0.999 and a detection limit of 0.180 μM. In addition, the
GaN nanowire-modified PGE surface showed high selectivity for the
detection of NO as compared to other relevant biomolecules. This confirms
that the PGE/GaN nanowire is a new promising electrochemical sensor
for the sensitive detection of NO.

1 Introduction
Detailed
investigations on the evaluation of the characteristics
of nanomaterials over the past few decades have emerged in the better
design and development of device performances including the electrochemical
sensing platform for the detection of biomolecules. Among the various
wurtzite crystalline structure-based electrode materials, gallium
nitride (GaN) is a wide and direct band gap semiconducting material
that is of paramount research interest for a range of electronic and
optoelectronic applications owing to its long-term chemical stability,
nontoxicity, and biocompatibility. Hence, GaN is identified as a potential
candidate for biosensing applications.1−3 The unique structure
of GaN nanowires has a large surface to volume ratio, which provides
a higher surface conductivity compared to the conventional planar
GaN.4 Recently, we have reported on the
synthesis of GaN nanoparticles by the hydrothermal method.5 There have been many attempts at sensing (l-cysteine, DNA molecules) biomolecules using GaN nanowires
through electrochemical detection methods.6,7

Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most important biomolecules in
nature, which plays a key role in the regulation of blood pressure
for many physiological processes including cardiovascular systems,
wound healing, angiogenesis, platelet aggregation, immune responses,
vasodilation, inflammation, and neurotransmission.8−13 However, the detection of NO in biological systems is significant
with challenges because of its short half-life (<10 s), wide concentration
range (picomolar to micromolar), and complexity of other molecules.14−16 In general, numerous analytical techniques such as chemiluminescence,
absorbance, fluorescence, and electron paramagnetic resonance have
been using expensive instruments. Detection of NO by the electrochemical
detection method is simple, rapid, and of relatively low cost and
high sensitivity. Hence, nanomaterial-based electrodes are used, which
offer a better platform for the sensitive detection of NO.16,17

The design of an electrochemical sensor, based on carbon electrodes,
has attracted wide attention in the recent years.18,19 Among different kinds of carbon-based electrodes such as carbon
paste, glassy carbon, carbon nanotube, ordered mesoporous, normal
graphite electrodes modified with various redox mediators are used
in the electroanalytical field. Especially, the pencil graphite electrode
(PGE) has enormous advantages such as low cost, ease of availability,
adjustable active surface area, ease of technology for surface modification,
and miniaturization.20,21 Modified PGE-based electrochemical
sensing platforms have attracted considerable attention in the field
of analytical chemistry, which can improve the detection of biomolecules;
for example, electrochemical detection of adenine based on copper
nanoparticles (CuNPs)-modified PGE,22 detection
of glucose by immobilization of graphene oxide on the graphene-modified
PGE,23 and DNA-based biosensor by immobilization
of MWCNT-PDDA/DNA-modified PGE.24 The electroactivity
of PGEs depends on surface pretreatment using electrochemical procedures,25,26 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the preparation
of GaN nanowires on PGE and its use for NO-sensing. In this report,
we demonstrate a novel approach for the preparation of GaN nanowire
growth on PGE via hydrothermal method. The resulting nanowires of
GaN/PGE showed good analytical performance for NO owing to its higher
electrocatalytic activity and improved active sites for NO detection
than pristine PGE. The PGE surface could be efficiently covered with
electroactive sites of GaN nanowires for the electrocatalytic oxidation
of NO detection with a wide linear range, good detection limit, and
remarkable sensitivity and selectivity.

2 Results
and Discussion
The morphological and structural features
of the PGE and GaN/PGE
nanowires were studied using field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM) and are shown in Figure 1. The obtained morphological features are seen in Figure 1i–ii for PGE
and GaN/PGE nanowire samples, respectively. The FE-SEM images in Figure 1i show the pristine
PGE at different magnifications. Figure 1i(b,c) shows the layer by layer pattern that
can be clearly observed in the pristine PGE. Figure 1ii shows the GaN/PEG samples at different
magnifications, which clearly exhibit the nanowire-like structure
that have been grown using hydrothermal method. These observations
are similar to the reports published on GaN nanowires.27,28 The GaN nanowires coated on the PGE substrate are of an average
size of 32 ± 5 nm. The hydrothermally grown GaN nanowire has
improved the active sites through large surface to volume ratio yield
with a higher surface electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the elemental
analysis was investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDAX),
which confirmed carbon on PGE and C, Ga, and N on GaN/PGE and is presented
in Figure 1d–h.
The results confirm the growth of GaN nanowires on PGE and its suitability
for the detection of NO.

and GaN/PGE nanowires.

High-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HR-TEM) provides
additional information on the crystal structure and morphology of
GaN nanowires. Figure 2a,b displays the low-magnification HR-TEM images of GaN nanowires
with dimensions of 31.4 and 35.9 nm. Recently, low-dimensional nanostructures
(nanorods and nanowires) realized through a catalyst-free method have
been reported.29,30 The well-resolved lattice fringe
observed in Figure 3c reveals that the GaN nanowires grown on PGE are highly single crystalline
in nature. Figure 2d shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of
single GaN nanowires. The SAED pattern results also confirm the crystalline
quality of GaN nanowires. The structural confirmation has clearly
showcased the hexagonal GaN nanowires shown in Figures S1 and S2 (Supporting Information).

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement was carried
out for investigations on the chemical composition and on the chemical
states of PGE and GaN/PGE nanowires. Figure 3a,b shows the XPS survey spectra of the GaN/PGE
nanowires and PGE, indicating the presence of the following elements:
Ga, N, C, and O. Figure 4C indicates the O 1s center peak at 529.8 eV; the element O 1s arises
from the surface pollution of the PGE and GaN/PGE nanowires. Figure 3d,e is the gauss
fit of the C 1s spectrum, ranging from 282 to 288 eV. The major peak
in the XPS spectra was at 284.2 eV, which is assigned to the graphitic
region created by the sp2 carbon atoms (C1), which confirms that the
C atoms are arranged in a honeycomb lattice. The peak in the XPS spectra
observed at 285.7 eV corresponding to the sp3 C–O
bonds were found as the only form of carbon–oxygen functionalities
on the PGE and GaN/PGE nanowires.31 The
XPS spectra of the Ga 2p and N 1s core level regions of the sample
have been clearly observed and are shown in Figure 3f,g. The XPS peaks of GaN/PGE nanowires obtained
at 1021, 1044, and 398 eV corresponding to the Ga 2p and N 1s core
levels are shown in Figure 3f,g. The results are in good agreement with those previously
reported for GaN nanoparticles32 and confirms
the formation of the GaN/PGE nanowire.

(a) PGE and (b) GaN/PGE modified electrode for 1 μM of NO2– in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5) at an applied potential
of 0.85 V.

The effect of applied potential
for amperometric response of the
GaN nanowire-modified PGE is shown in Figure 4A. Over the potential range of 0.80–0.90
V, the highest current response of NO2– was achieved at 0.85 V for GaN nanowire-modified PGE. This observation
indicates higher electrocatalytic ability of GaN nanowire-modified
PGE toward the detection of NO. Therefore, 0.85 V was chosen as the
applied potential for all the other amperometric experiments. The
cyclic voltammetry (CV) analysis implies the large surface area and
high electrical conductivity of GaN/PGE nanowire shown in Figure S3A
(Supporting Information). Figure S3B realizes
the good electrical conductivity and accelerates the good interfacial
electron transfer for the sensor applications (Supporting Information).

The electrochemical properties
of PGE (a) and PGE on GaN nanowire
(b) was probed through amperometric measurement in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5)
at an applied potential of 0.85 V. Figure 4B reveals that the GaN nanowire on PGE has
significantly enhanced amperometric signal response toward the NO
detection compared to the PGE. This confirms that GaN nanowire on
PGE can provide a better electrocatalytic activity because of its
large surface area and high electrical conductivity.

The electrochemical
sensing performance of GaN/PGE toward NO2– in studied upon addition of NO2– in
0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5) under the applied potential
of 0.85 V. Figure 5A presents the chronoamperometric responses at different concentrations
of NO2– in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5), the electrochemical
signal responses dramatically increases with increasing NO2– concentration. The nanomaterial of the GaN/PGE
nanowire shows a linear relationship between the chronoamperometric
signal responses of NO2– concentration
in the range of 1.0 μM to 1.0 mM with a correlation coefficient
of 0.999 and a detection limit of 0.180 μM.

response recorded at the GaN/PGE nanowire

0.85 V. (B) Chronoamperometric responses of the GaN/PGE nanowire upon
the successive addition of NO2–, DA,
AA, GLU, UA, and NO2.

To test the anti-interference ability is one of the crucial requirements
for the practical sensor under the applied potential of 0.85 V. Figure 5B shows the amperometric
response achieved by successive addition to 10 μM NO2–, 100 μM DA, 100 μM AA, 100 μM
GLU, 100 μM UA, and 20 μM NO2– in 0.1 M PBS (pH 2.5). No obvious amperometric signal responses
were observed with the coexisting electroactive species such as DA,
AA, GLU, and UA. The results indicate that the GaN nanowire on PGE
has high selectivity toward the detection of NO. The comparison of
the sensor materials, electrolyte, linear range, detection limit,
analytical techniques, and applied potentials of the GaN nanowire-modified
PGE with other reported electrochemical sensors for the detection
of NO is given in Table 1.

3 Conclusions
In summary, we report on
the growth of the GaN/PGE nanowire using
the hydrothermal method followed by annealing treatment. PGE is efficiently
covered with GaN nanowires and is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy,
FE-SEM, HR-TEM, and XPS. The GaN/PGE nanowires showed the higher electrocatalytic
activity toward NO, which is dramatically lower than conventional
planar GaN structures owing to its specific large surface to volume
ratio yield with a higher surface conductivity. The results demonstrated
provide the features of wide linear range, low detection limit, remarkable
sensitivity and selectivity compared to the other reports in literature.
The GaN/PGE nanowire provides a simple, fast, enzyme-free, and cost-effective
method to detect NO and can be further applied to electrochemical
detection of real samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Gallium (III) oxide (Ga2O3), hydrochloric acid (HCl), ammonium hydroxide
(NH4OH), disodium phosphate (Na2HPO4), monosodium phosphate (NaH2PO4), phosphoric
acid (H3PO4), K3[Fe(CN)6], H2O2 (30%), glucose, acetaminophen, ascorbic
acid and uric acid were purchased from sigma Aldrich; PGEs (0.7 mm
in diameter, 6 cm in length, and geometric area of 31.19). The working
electrodes were covered with Teflon and the electrical contact with
the working electrode was made by joining a copper wire in one end.26 Phosphate buffer solution (0.1 M PBS) pH 2.5
was prepared by mixing a standard stock solution of 0.1 M Na2HPO4 and NaH2PO4 in deionized water
and adjusting the pH with 1.0 M H3PO4.

4.2 Characterization
An electrochemical
cell connected to a three-electrode system with a GaN nanowire-modified
pencil graphite working electrode (PGE), Ag/AgCl (3 M NaCl) reference
electrode, and platinum wire auxiliary electrode were used. CV and
electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out in a
CHI 660C electrochemical instrumentation. EIS data were measured in
the frequency range of 0.1 Hz and 100 kHz at an applied dc potential
0.25 V (the formal potential of a [Fe(CN)6]3– redox couple) and ac amplitude of 5 mV. EIS measurement was taken
in the presence of 5 mM [Fe(CN)6]3– solution
containing 0.1 mM KCl. Morphological studies of the PGE and GaN nanowire
on PGE surfaces were conducted using FE-SEM (Carl Zeiss Supra 55VP).
Structural studies of the GaN nanowire on PGE were carried out using
HR-TEM (JEOL 3010 with a UHR pole piece). Raman spectra were recorded
using a diode pumped solid state laser source of 532 nm [WITec alpha300RA
(WITec GmbH, Ulm, Germany)]. XPS analysis was carried out using [Oxford
instruments (Germany)] an aluminum source (Al Kα radiation hν = 1486.7 eV).

4.3 Growth
of GaN Nanowires
GaN nanowires
were realized using the hydrothermal method followed by annealing
treatment. 0.1 M Ga2O3 was used as the starting
material. As Ga2O3 is insoluble in water, initially
HCl was added to dissolve Ga2O3 and then 40
mL of distilled water was added to the solution. The obtained solution
was stirred for 2 h. Subsequently, a sufficient amount of NH4OH was added to the Ga2O3 solution and maintained
at a pH of 6. Finally, the solution was transferred to a Teflon-lined
autoclave inside which PGEs were placed. The autoclave was kept inside
a hot air oven and maintained at a temperature of 453 K for 15 h.
The gallium oxide-coated PGE was kept for nitrification in a quartz
reactor under constant ammonia flow at the rate of 0.8 standard liters
per minute (slm) and at a temperature of 1223 K for 5 h. The overall
growth process is schematically shown in Figure 6.
