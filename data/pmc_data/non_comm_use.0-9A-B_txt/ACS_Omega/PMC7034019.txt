Biomass wastes are abundant and common
in our daily life, and they
are cost-effective, promising, and renewable. Herein, collected willow
catkins were used to prepare a hydrophilic biochar composite membrane,
which was placed in a tree-like evaporation configuration to simulate
a natural transpiration process. The strong light absorption (∼96%)
of the biochar layer could harvest light and convert it into thermal
energy, which then is used to heat the surrounding water pumped by
a porous water channel via capillary action. A hydrophilic light-absorber
layer remarkably increased the attachment sites of water molecules,
thereby maximizing the use of thermal energy. At the same time, hierarchically
porous structure and large specific surface area (∼1380 m2 g–1) supplied more available channels for
rapid water vapor diffusion. The as-prepared composite membrane with
a low-cost advantage realized a high evaporation rate (1.65 kg m–2 h–1) only under 1 sun illumination
(1 kW m–2), which was improved by roughly 27% in
comparison with the unmodified hydrophobic composite membrane. The
tree-like evaporation configuration with excellent heat localization
resulted in the evaporator achieving a high solar-to-vapor conversion
efficiency of ∼90.5%. Besides, the composite membrane could
remove 99.9% sodium ions from actual seawater and 99.5% heavy metal
ions from simulated wastewater, and the long-term stable evaporation
performance proved its potential in actual solar desalination. This
work not only fabricated an efficient evaporator but also provided
a strategy for reusing various natural wastes for water purification.

Introduction
Due
to the lack of clean and safe water in the world, how to solve
the crisis has become one of the most important focus in scientific
research studies.1−3 Desalination is an important technique for obtaining
pure water from seawater. Generally, traditional desalination processes
(such as membrane technologies, mechanical engines, and electrochemical
devices) have large energy requirement and high cost. Sometimes, the
processes could lead to environmental pollution.4−6 As one of the
most abundant renewable resource on the earth, solar energy can be
collected and converted into thermal energy via various light absorbers.
As a result, solar steam generation is expected to be an efficient
method to produce pure water.7−11 With respect to the conventional nanofluid system, energy cannot
be completely utilized to heat the bulk water; therefore, the process
usually involves considerable heat loss between the bulk water and
outer environment.12−15 As for another reported light absorbers, such as plasmonic nanoparticles,16,17 graphene oxide, and carbon nanotubes,18−21 they still face high cost and
complicated preparation procedure, which significantly restrict their
large-scale application in desalination.22 Therefore, it is necessary to develop cost-effective materials with
a high energy conversion efficiency.23−25

Natural biomass
is widely founded in people’s lives, and
it has a huge potential application value as a renewable resource.
Because of low cost, large specific surface area, and porous structure,
biochar derived from the biomass have been utilized in energy storage,
energy conversion, and environment remediation.26−31 In recent years, the carbonized biomass has been considered as an
effective light absorber in solar steam generation, and most of the
studies have focused on only using the high-temperature carbonization
method.32−35 For example, wood-based evaporators with low tortuosity have a low
evaporation rate due to a relatively thick light-absorbing layer via
direct carbonization or flame treatment.32 Therefore, they only achieved high evaporation rate and energy conversion
efficiency under strong sun illumination, which could increase the
cost and energy consumption in the practical application.33,36−41 Liu’s group directly carbonized lotus seedpods, which exhibited
a lower evaporation rate of 1.3 kg m–2 h–1.42 Considering that the capillary action
is inversely proportional to the pore size, the reasons of a low evaporation
rate might be that the large pore size (>0.8 mm) of the petiole
decreased
the capillary action and water supply rate. Besides, when water was
pumped into the receptacle, larger open pores (≈1 mm) on its
surface might cause more heat dissipation according to Hu’s
report.43 Zhu et al. used carbonized mushrooms
with a well macroporous structure as a low-cost evaporator.34 However, because of the existing problem similar
to that of the wood-based evaporators, their evaporation rate and
light-to-vapor conversion efficiency were only 1.5 kg m–2 h–1 and 78% under 1 sun illumination, respectively.
To solve the above issues, Liu et al. utilized carbonized corn straw
powders as a light-absorbing layer and then coated them on the surface
of geopolymer-based support with excellent thermal insulation.44 The result indicated that the mesoporous structure
of the biomass can accelerate water transportation. Nevertheless,
the low specific surface area (467 m2 g–1) just increased the evaporation rate to 1.58 kg m–2 h–1. In view of this fact, only carbonization
treatment and simply using a biomimetic channel structure cannot solve
the problems of low evaporation rate and low energy conversion efficiency.
Recently, some researchers have proposed that water from hydrophilic
materials with porous structures had lower vaporization enthalpy than
bulk water, which was beneficial for more effective energy utilization
and a faster evaporation rate.45−48 Therefore, limiting water to a thin evaporation layer
and increasing the specific surface area and the hydrophilicity of
light absorbers may be effective methods to improve evaporation performance.

Willow catkins are a kind of common natural waste in many large
cities of China. In spring, a large number of catkins float in the
air and lie on the roads, which may cause a fire hazard and worsen
the air quality, even respiratory allergies. Owing to the hollow structure
and large specific surface area of catkin fibers, they have been studied
in energy storage and water treatment, such as supercapacitor electrodes
and oil absorption materials.49−52 So far, there are few reports about the use of carbonized
catkins as photothermal materials for solar steam generation. Herein,
our work prepared a hydrophilic polymer-modified biochar composite
membrane via a simple three-step process. Through carbonizing willow
catkins and pore former together, the biochar layer obtained a hierarchically
porous structure, resulting in reducing light loss and accelerating
vapor diffusion. Mixed acid treatment and polydopamine (PDA) modification
can supply more hydrophilic functional groups on the biochar layer
to increase contact sites with water molecules and then enhance evaporation
performance. Moreover, a tree-like evaporation configuration, which
has been proved to have excellent heat localization ability, was utilized
to simulate the natural transpiration process and collect clean water.53,54 As a result, the composite membrane exhibited a highly efficient
solar steam generation and a stable desalination performance. This
work proposed a novel strategy of reusing willow catkins, which could
be very promising in solar desalination and water purification.

Results
and Discussion
A porous activated carbon prepared from willow
catkins was modified
by hydrophilic poly-dopamine,55,56 which was formed into
biochar composite membrane after filtration. A schematic diagram of
the preparation of the composite membrane is shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Schematic diagram of
the preparation of the composite membrane.

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images were taken to observe the porous structure and inner
morphologies of the treated catkins. Figure 2a indicates that the porous carbon polyhedra
(PCPs) had obvious and abundant pores after the activation and carbonization
treatment, which was conducive for constructing transpiration channels
for water vapor. The digital picture in the inset of Figure 2b shows that the composite
membrane had a black upper surface due to the biochar deposition,
and the composite membrane still remained integrated after shaking
several times (Movie S1). The SEM images
(Figure 2b,c) present
the surface and enlarged morphologies of modified PCPs, respectively,
indicating the interconnected macroporous structure of the biochar
layer. In comparison with the PCPs, many PDA particles were deposited
on the surface of the modified PCPs and their porous structures were
not destroyed after the PDA modification (red magnified parts in Figure 2c). The TEM image
clearly shows that a thin slice of the biochar had a large number
of mesoporous structures (Figure 2d).

The digital
picture in the inset of (b) is the composite membrane with a diameter
of 2 cm. (d) TEM image of modified PCPs.

To verify its porous structure and obtain the specific surface
area, the modified PCPs were investigated by the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
test (Figure 3). The
isotherm curve was type IV with a hysteresis loop (Figure 3a), indicating the presence
of microporous and mesoporous structures.57 The result is consistent with the TEM image (Figure 2d). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area of the modified PCPs was calculated to be 1380
m2 g–1, with the total pore volume of
0.7 cm3 g–1. KOH has a strong activation
capability for the willow catkins by reacting with carbon during the
carbonization process, leading to the release of a gas product to
introduce porosity, which resulted in a high specific surface area.58−60Figure 3b shows the
distribution of mesopore diameters between 2 and 50 nm, and the average
pore size of modified PCPs was about 2 nm. Figures 2 and 3 indicate that
modified PCPs had a hierarchically porous structure, which was beneficial
for enhancing light absorption and transportation of water molecules.61

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were measured to investigate
the functional groups of PCPs and modified PCPs (Figure 4a). The PCPs had two significant
characteristic peaks at 3433 and 1621 cm–1, corresponding
to O–H groups and C=C of the aromatic ring, respectively.28,50 After the polymerization process, the PCPs showed several new absorption
peaks. Due to the effect of strong acid on the biochar, three peaks
at 1718, 1555, and 1438 cm–1 were characteristic
to the stretching vibration of C=O of −COO– groups.62 Moreover, two peaks appearing at about 3200
and 1275 cm–1 corresponded to the N–H symmetric
stretching vibration and the C–N stretching vibration from
PDA, respectively.55,63,64 In addition, X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) further confirmed
the element compositions before and after PDA modification (Figure 4b). After the modification,
the N 1s peak can be clearly observed in the XPS spectrum of modified
PCPs, and the mass ratio of C/N decreased from 35.57 to 15.06 (Table S1), which proved that the PDA particles
were successfully anchored on the carbonized catkins.

XPS spectra (b) of PCPs and modified PCPs.

To further enhance the solar steam generation, we used a tree-like
evaporation configuration to perform the entire experiment (Figure 5a). The composite
membrane (thermal conductivity was 0.297 W m–1 K–1) was placed on the upper surface of polystyrene foam
(thermal conductivity was 0.035 W m–1 K–1) floating on water to decrease the heat conduction to the bulk water.
The hydrophilic glass-fiber paper across the foam could deliver the
water to the composite membrane via capillary action. To determine
the heat concentration performance, the light absorption of the black
composite membrane was tested by a UV–vis–NIR spectrophotometer.
Since the porous structure could reduce light loss by confining light
in small caves,65 the average absorption
of the composite membrane can reach ∼96% in the wavelength
range of 250–2500 nm, which was much higher than that of the
pure cellulose membrane (Figure 5b). Due to the excellent light absorption performance,
the surface of the membrane could rapidly increase from 19.6 to 41.3
°C within 10 min and then reach an equilibrium temperature under
1 sun illumination (Figure 5c). As the sun illumination intensity rose, the surface temperatures
increased to 46.7, 52.1, and 57.2 °C under 2, 3, and 4 sun illumination
after 60 min, respectively (Figure 5d).

under 4 sun illumination.

Besides, hydrophilic water channels also contributed to improving
solar evaporation performance. As shown in Figure S1, the modification treatment can remarkably decrease the
water contact angle from 130 to 40°; meanwhile, it can also offer
hydrophilic sites for a continuous grabbing of water molecules from
surrounding channels. The hydrophilic channels had a larger gas–liquid
contact surface and resulted in a more efficient solar water evaporation.66−68 To confirm the result, unmodified PCPs and modified PCPs were loaded
on the cellulose paper of the same area, and both of them had a loading
mass of 15 mg each. The result indicated that the modified composite
membrane had a larger mass loss after 60 min illumination under 1
sun (Figure S2), thereby proving that hydrophilic
hierarchical pores were more conducive for a fast vapor diffusion.
To determine the appropriate loading mass, different loading masses
of modified PCPs were filtered on the cellulose paper of the same
area. Figure 5e shows
that the composite membrane had a higher water mass loss than the
bulk water without any light absorber. However, the mass of light
absorber was not directly proportional to the evaporation rate. When
the loading mass increased from 5 to 15 mg, the evaporation rate went
up from 1.38 to 1.65 kg m–2 h–1. In contrast, the evaporation rate of the composite membrane with
a loading mass of 20 mg dropped to 1.47 kg m–2 h–1. This was because thicker light absorber layers could
hinder the fast diffusion of water molecules. Therefore, we optimized
the loading mass according to the data and used the composite membrane
with a loading mass of 15 mg as an example in the following investigation.
As we know, the optical concentration has a great effect on the surface
temperature, which further affects the water evaporation rate. As
shown in Figure 5f,
the mass change witnessed a significant upward trend with the increasing
light intensity. The water evaporation rates under 4 sun illumination
could reach 5.90 kg m–2 h–1, which
was 3.5 times that under 1 sun illumination. The inset picture presents
the visible steam on the surface of the composite membrane under 4
sun illumination (Movie S2). The above
result indicated that the hydrophilic porous structure can not only
rapidly absorb the water from the bulk and transport water molecule
to the heating location but also supply large number of transpiration
channels for a fast vapor diffusion.

The light-to-vapor energy
conversion efficiency (ECE) was an important
criterion to evaluate the evaporation performance of the materials.
Therefore, we calculated the ECE value according to the following
equation  where ṁ is the mass
flux, hLV is the total enthalpy of the
liquid–vapor phase change, P0 is
the normal solar illumination of 1 sun (1 kW m–2), and CoptP0 is the illumination intensity on the absorber surface.22,53 In particular, the calculation of hLV was based on the sensible heat- and temperature-dependent enthalpy
of vaporization (Figure S3 and Table S2). The detailed calculation process is presented in the Supporting Information. The conversion efficiencies
of the composite membrane gradually increased from 90.5 to 94.1% when
the illumination increased from 1 to 4 sun (Figure 6a). We listed some of the reported light
absorbers made by biomass materials (Figure 6b).32,34−40 In most studies, researchers usually only used the intrinsic transport
channels of natural materials without further treatment. Therefore,
under 1 sun illumination, their evaporation rates were below 1.6 kg
m–1 h–1, and the corresponding
efficiencies were lower than that of our work. Although some absorbers
obtained excellent solar evaporation performance, they usually needed
exposure to higher optical concentration.

efficiency of a modified membrane with 15
mg of absorbers under 1–4 sun illumination. (b) Solar steam
efficiencies of our work compared to other reports about the biomass
materials.

Solar energy is a sustainable
and pollution-free source that can
be used to solve many serious global challenges, including desalination
and wastewater treatment. Therefore, we studied the evaporation performance
and salt rejection of the composite membrane in three kinds of bulk
water, namely, simulated brine containing different concentrations
of sodium chloride, actual seawater from the Bohai Sea (China) and
wastewater containing heavy-metal ions. As shown in Figure 7a, the composite membrane can
steadily produce clean water with an average rate of 1.62, 1.45, 1.22,
and 1.08 kg m–2 h–1 when they
treated simulated seawater with concentrations of 1.5, 3.0, 3.5, and
4.0% NaCl, respectively. During vaporization of actual seawater, the
evaporation rate can reach up to 1.52 kg m–2 h–1 (Figure S4). Through collecting
the condensed water in a glass container (Figure S5), the product water quality can be evaluated using inductively
coupled plasma (ICP) technique. Figure 7b,c shows that most ions from the bulk solution were
removed and the concentration of ions in the collected water was far
lower than the standard of the World Health Organization (WHO). The
evaporator can also remove 99.5% heavy-metal ions from simulated wastewater
(Figures 7d and S6). The above results proved that the tree-like
evaporator had excellent solar desalination and water treatment performances.
Moreover, the long-term tests indicated that the composite membrane
maintained a relatively stable evaporation rate of ∼1.51 kg
m–1 h–1, with the solar-to-vapor
efficiency of around 82% during 10 cycles (Figure S7).

under 1 sun illumination.

Conclusions
In summary, we presented a PDA-modified biochar composite membrane
for solar steam generation. Due to the advantages of a hierarchically
porous structure and large specific surface area, the light absorber
can harvest light energy to the maximum extent (∼96%) and convert
it into thermal energy. Hydrophilic channels enabled the biochar composite
membrane to pump water continuously and generate water vapor more
effectively in the process of solar evaporation. The tree-like evaporation
configuration with a low-cost advantage realized an evaporation rate
of 1.65 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun
illumination (1 kW m–2), which allowed the evaporator
to achieve a solar-to-vapor conversion efficiency of ∼90.5%.
In addition, the composite membrane can efficiently remove sodium
ions from actual seawater (≥99.9%) and heavy-metal ions from
simulated wastewater (≥99.5%). The long-term stable evaporation
performance proved its potential in actual solar desalination. More
significantly, our work put forward a strategy of recycling and reusing
natural biomass waste and broadened their potential application in
environmental and energy fields.

Experimental Section
Materials
The catkins were collected in May in Heilongjiang
University (Harbin, China). Dopamine hydrochloride and tris (hydroxymethyl)
aminomethane hydrochlorlde (Tris–HCl) were purchased from Aladdin
Chemical Co., Ltd. NaCl, Pb (NO3)2, ZnCl2, CuSO4·5H2O, Ni(NO3)2·6H2O, and Cd(NO3)2·4H2O were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd. Water used in all of the experiments was deionized. The
seawater was obtained from the Bohai Sea, China.

Preparation
of the Composite Membrane
First, the catkins
were washed to remove seeds and dust and then dried at 80 °C
for 6 h. A certain mass of white crude catkins was activated by 2
M KOH solution and then dried in 80 °C for 12 h. Subsequently,
it was heated to 750 °C at the rate of 5 °C min–1 and kept for 1 h under nitrogen atmosphere in a nickel crucible.
The resulting solid was repeatedly washed with 1 M HCl and deionized
water until the pH value of the filtrate reached about 7. The samples
were named as PCPs.

The PCPs were treated using mixed acid (H2SO4/HNO3 = 3:1) for 1 h and then washed
by deionized (DI) water until the pH value of the filtrate reached
about 7. Subsequently, 15 mg of acidified PCPs were added into dopamine
hydrochloride Tris-buffer solution (pH = 8.5, 50 mM) and then stirred
for 8 h at 25 °C according to refs (55, 56). The samples were washed by deionized water
several times, and they were named as modified PCPs. Finally, the
as-prepared product was filtered in a cellulose filter with a thickness
of 200 um under a pressure of 0.1 MPa and dried at 60 °C for
4 h.

Characterization
The morphology and structure of the
samples were characterized by a scanning electron microscope (S-4800)
and a transmission electron microscopy (JEM1005 at 100 kV). The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface area measurement was carried out by nitrogen adsorption–desorption
(ASAP 2020). The elements and functional groups of the samples were
characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, AXIS Ultra
DLD, Kratos) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (ADVANCE
III). Contact angle measurement was performed using a contact angle
meter (OCA20, Dataphysics) by placing a water droplet (∼5 μL)
on the surface of the samples. The light source was a 300 W xenon
lamp (Micro-solar 300UV, Perfect Light, simulated sunlight source).
The light intensity was calibrated by a photo radiometer (PL-MW2000,
Perfect Light). Simultaneously, the real-time temperature was monitored
by an infrared radiation (IR) camera (FLIR One Pro). The concentrations
of ions were measured using an inductively coupled plasma-optical
emission spectrometer (Optima 8300, PerkinElmer). The thermal conductivity
was evaluated by the Netzsch hyper flash apparatus at room temperature
(LFA 467).

Solar Steam Generation Measurement
The composite membrane
was cut into a circular shape with a diameter of 20 mm and placed
on the polystyrene foam with low thermal conductivity. The above part
was fixed on the top of a circular quartz container, which was surrounded
by a thermal insulation layer. A rectangle glass filter paper was
used as a hydrophilic bridge between the bulk water and the membrane.
The whole device was irradiated by a solar simulator under different
optical concentrations. The evaporation rates were measured after
steadily running for 30 min, and the weight loss was recorded using
an electronic mass balance. Temperature changes of the surface of
the membrane were monitored using an IR camera. During each test,
the ambient temperature was maintained at 24–26 °C, and
the ambient humidity was maintained at 45–50%.
