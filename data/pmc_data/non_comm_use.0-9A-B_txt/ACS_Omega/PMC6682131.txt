Knowledge of prebiotic
nucleobase formation is important for understanding
the origin of contemporary genetics. Observation of nucleobase precursor
radicals in previous impact laser plasma simulations of the late heavy
bombardment period (Ferus  Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2015 , 112 , 657 25489115 ) points toward possible nucleobase formation through free-radical
pathways. However, previously explored radical routes to nucleobase
formation involve a large number of reaction steps, repetitive addition
of precursors, and a number of chemical transformations. The possibility
of competing side reactions under such conditions questions the feasibility
of such pathways. In view of these shortcomings, the present work
employs density functional theory to explore purine formation pathways
through reaction of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene with radicals via
a five-membered intermediate, 4-cyanoimidazole in the presence of
ammonia. Our analysis reveals that the skeletal components of 4-cyanoimidazole
can be solely obtained from cyanamide and cyanoacetylene via barrierless
cyclization and a small number of reaction steps. In addition, the
proposed mechanisms are characterized by a small number of precursors
and low energy barriers and are thus likely feasible under extreme
conditions on the prebiotic earth such as meteoritic impact during
late heavy bombardment period. Overall, the present study underscores
the importance of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene precursors in kinetically
accessible routes to purine formation.

1 Introduction
Despite
inkling of the presence of nucleobases in simulations of
early earth environment1−5 and extensive exploration of their possible formation from a myriad
of prebiotic precursors,2,6−12 consensus on the prebiotic origin of these vital components of genetics
is still not achieved. Nevertheless, continuous input of intense UV13 and cosmic rays, coupled with bombardment of
extraterrestrial material on primitive earth during late heavy bombardment
period14 suggests that nucleobases might
have formed from simple precursors through radical pathways.3 Indeed, radicals such as ·NH2, ·CN, and ·NH have been detected when high-powered laser
was used to induce 4500 K plasma of the reaction products during high-energy
synthesis of nucleobases from formamide.1 Further, free-radical nucleobase formation routes have been theoretically
proposed, which involve a variety of prebiotic molecules (e.g., hydrogen
cyanide (HCN), acetylene, urea, and formamide) and radicals and construct
the nucleobase skeleton using a large number of tandem reaction steps.15−19

In contrast, an alternate hypothesis involves the utilization
of
a small number of precursors containing ready-made nucleobase skeletal
components to form nucleobases in a relatively smaller number of steps.
Such scenarios will automatically optimize the atom economy and reduce
the possibility of competing side reactions. Cyanamide and cyanoacetylene
are two such precursors relevant to prebiotic earth.20−23 Cyanamide can be formed from an irradiated mixture of simple, prebiotically
relevant molecules such as methane, ammonia, water, and HCN24 and is considered as an effective prebiotic
condensing agent.25,26 Similarly, the presence of cyanoacetylene
in the prebiotic environment and its involvement in prebiotic reactions
have been advocated.22,27 For instance, cyanoacetylene
is formed as a major product from the action of an electric discharge
on gaseous mixtures mimicking an early earth atmosphere.23 Under prebiotic aqueous conditions, cyanoacetylene
reacts not only with cyanamide to give cytidine and its derivatives26 but also with cyanate27 or urea23 to give cytosine and uracil.

Given the previously suggested possibility of the formation of
radicals in an high-energy impact scenario on prebiotic earth1,28 and evidence of ammonia as a component of the early earth atmosphere,29 we expect the evolution of feasible ammonia-assisted
pathways to nucleobase formation through reaction of cyanamide and
cyanoacetylene under such conditions. On these lines, to evaluate
the hypothesis on the coexistence and possible reactions of these
precursors in a prebiotic scenario, we employ density functional theory
to initiate preliminary investigations for exploring plausible radical
routes to the formation of purines (i.e., adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine,
isoguanine, purine, and xanthine) starting from cyanamide and cyanoacetylene
and involving precursors such as HCN,30 ·H,31 and ·OH,31 ·NH219 formed
photochemically during high-energy impact events,1 as well as urea formed from acidic hydrolysis of cyanamide.32 In addition to being unique in suggesting the
role of cyanamide and cyanoacetylene in the formation of purines in
the prebiotic scenario, our work will hopefully inspire further investigations
to develop a better understanding of the prebiotic reactions that
led to the formation of purines.

2 Results
Previous experimental8,33−35 and theoretical17,36 studies have highlighted the
significance of imidazole derivatives in the formation of purines.
Thus, we envision the prebiotic purine synthesis using cyanamide and
cyanoacetylene through the involvement of the 4-cyanoimidazole intermediate,
which subsequently reacts with secondary precursors to add a six-membered
heterocyclic ring characteristic of various purines (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Reaction pathways leading
to purine skeleton formations from cyanamide
(P1) and cyanoacetylene (P2) proposed in
the present work.

2.1 Formation
of 4-cyanoimidazole Intermediate
We envision the formation
of 4-cyanoimidazole (Figure 2) through a barrierless attack
of ·OH on one equivalent of cyanamide (P1; Figure 2) to generate the
radical intermediate 2 (Table S2 and Figures 2 and 11). The next step involves the formation of intermediate 4 through 1,3-hydrogen shift from the amino group to the C=N·
group of 2. Since the direct hydrogen shift involves
a high (37.9 kcal mol–1) barrier (Figure S1), this transformation is accomplished through the
assistance of catalytic ammonia, which splits the single-step hydrogen
shift into two low-barrier steps. Specifically, intermediate 2 abstracts hydrogen from ammonia to form a neutral intermediate 3 by crossing a barrier of 6.7 kcal mol–1 and generates the ·NH2 radical. Despite possible
side reactions of ·NH2 (e.g., recombination with ·H
to form ammonia), the subsequent step involves the attack of remaining
concentration of ·NH2 on the amino group of 3 to produce intermediate 4 by crossing a small
barrier of 4.1 kcal mol–1.

mechanism along with corresponding transition
states (TSs) for the formation of 4-cyanoimidazole (10) from cyanamide (P1). Gas-phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) relative
electronic energies (kcal mol–1) of the TSs (barriers)
with respect to reactants of each step are provided in parentheses.
Reactants are in red color. Each reactant is considered in its free
optimized state while calculating the electronic energies. As a result,
some of the complexed transition states possess negative energies
relative to the reactants.

The next step involves the reaction of the second precursor
(cyanoacetylene
(P2)) with intermediate 4 to form an acyclic
intermediate 6 across a low barrier of 5.7 kcal mol–1. This is followed by barrierless cyclization involving
an intramolecular attack of the radical center on the carbon–nitrogen
double bond to form a five-membered ring, which is concomitant with
the shift of radical center from the carbon bearing the cyano group
to the carbon bearing the hydroxyl group. The subsequent step involves
the formation of neutral species 8 from the radical intermediate 7 through a modest energy barrier (15.6 kcal mol–1; Figure 2) step involving
an ammonia molecule.

Intermediate 8 differs from
4-cyanoimidazole by a
single carbon–nitrogen double bond. Due to a significantly
high (50.6 kcal mol–1) barrier, the concerted water
elimination is disfavored (Figure S2).
Alternatively, the small concentration of ·NH2 available
in the vicinity can barrierlessly abstract hydrogen from the ring
nitrogen of 8 to generate ammonia and radical intermediate 9. Intermediate 9 crosses a modest (21.2 kcal
mol–1) barrier to release ·OH consumed in the
first step of the mechanism to form the carbon–nitrogen bond
characteristic of 4-cyanoimidazole 10.

2.2 Formation of Guanine and Hypoxanthine
The first step
involves the modest-barrier (3.0 kcal mol–1) activation
of 10 by ·OH to form enol radical 11 (Table S3 and Figures 3 and 11). 11 undergoes low-barrier (9.0 kcal mol–1) abstraction
of hydrogen from ammonia to form the neutral species 12, which barrierlessly tautomerizes to its keto form 13 through the assistance of ammonia. Despite the possibility
of side reactions (e.g., ·NH2 recombination), the α-amino group of 13 is then attacked by·NH2 along an energy barrier of 2.9 kcal mol–1 to generate the keto tautomeric form 14 of 11 (Figure 3). Both
the enol 11 and keto 14 tautomers are capable
of forming guanine or hypoxanthine through a series of steps described
below.

Figure 3 Mechanism for the formation of intermediates 11 and 14 used in guanine (18) and hypoxanthine (22) mechanisms. Gas-phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) relative electronic
energies (kcal mol–1) of the TSs (barriers) with
respect to reactants of each step are provided in parentheses. Each
reactant is considered in its free optimized state while calculating
the electronic energies. As a result, some of the complexed transition
states possess negative energies relative to the reactants.

2.2.1 Guanine
The
formation of guanine
through the enol radical 11 proceeds via the attack of 11 on the electron-rich (sp) carbon of cyanamide P1 after crossing a barrier of 5.2 kcal mol–1 to form 15a that bears the radical on nitrogen (Figure 4). The two −OH
rotamers of 15a (15a1 and 15a2; Figure S3) undergo intramolecular free-radical
cyclization along 16.0 and 11.9 kcal mol–1 barriers
(Figure 4) to form 16a1 and 16a2, respectively (Figure S4), which bear the radical at C5. The carbon–carbon
double bond bridging the five-membered and six-membered rings of guanine
is then created by removal of hydrogen from C4 of 16a1 or 16a2 through a barrier of 17.8 or 18.1 kcal mol–1 to form 17a1 or 17a2 (Figure S5), respectively, which represent the
enol tautomer of guanine (Figure 4). However, only 17a1 can convert to the
canonical (keto) tautomer of guanine 18 through a barrierless
ammonia-assisted transformation (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Stepwise proposed radical mechanism along with
corresponding transition
states (TSs) for the formation of guanine (18) from 4-cyanoimidazole
(10). Gas-phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) relative electronic
energies (kcal mol–1) of the TSs (barriers) with
respect to reactants of each step are provided in parentheses. Reactants
are in red color, and the product is in blue. Each reactant is considered
in its free optimized state while calculating the electronic energies.
As a result, some of the complexed transition states possess negative
energies relative to the reactants.

In contrast, the formation of guanine through the keto radical 14 proceeds through the attack of 14 on the electron-rich
C≡N center of cyanamide through a 5.1 kcal mol–1 barrier to form 15b with the nitrogen-centered radical
(Figure 4). 15b further undergoes modest-barrier (8.0 kcal mol–1) intramolecular cyclization to form intermediate 16b, which bears a radical at C5. The bridging C=C is then created
by the loss of hydrogen from C4 of 16b through a 23.8
kcal mol–1 barrier to form guanine.

2.2.2 Hypoxanthine
In contrast to guanine,
hypoxanthine formation via the enol radical 11 occurs
through the attack of a secondary precursor (HCN, P3)
on 11 along a barrier of 14.6 or 9.7 kcal mol–1 to form 19a1 or 19a2 −OH rotamers
(Figure S6), respectively, that bear a
radical on nitrogen (Figure 5). Intramolecular radical attack on the double bond of the
imidazole moiety of 19a1 or 19a2 through
a 16.5 or 10.0 kcal mol–1 barrier forms 20a1 or 20a2 (Figure S7), respectively,
which further releases ·OH through a 17.7 kcal mol–1 barrier to form the bridging double bond of 21a1 or 21a2, respectively (Figure 5 and Figure S8). However,
only 21a1 is capable of undergoing barrierless ammonia-assisted
keto–enol tautomerism to give canonical hypoxanthine 22.

states (TSs) for the formation of hypoxanthine (22) from
4-cyanoimidazole (10). Gas-phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) relative

with respect to reactants of each step are provided in parentheses.
Reactants are in red color, and the product is in blue. Each reactant
is considered in its free optimized state while calculating the electronic
energies. As a result, some of the complexed transition states possess
negative energies relative to the reactants.

In contrast, the mechanism involving the keto intermediate 14 proceeds through the barrierless attack of HCN on 14 to form 19b (Figure 5). The nitrogen-centered radical in 19b attacks the double bond of the imidazole moiety along
a barrier of 8.6 kcal mol–1 to form 20b. The loss of hydrogen attached to C4 of 20b via a 31.6
kcal mol–1 barrier forms the bridging double bond
of hypoxanthine.

TSs (barriers) with respect to reactants of each step are provided

blue.

2.3 Formation
of Adenine
Adenine formation
involves the attack of ·NH2 on the cyano group of 10 through a 7.2 kcal mol–1 barrier to form 23 (Table S3 and Figures 6 and 11). Intermediate 23 reacts with P4 (generated from the attack
of ·H on species 3, Figures 6 and 7) by crossing
a 14.5 kcal mol–1 barrier to form 24. Adduct 24 undergoes cyclization through the 18.6 kcal
mol–1 shift of the radical center from N9 to C5
to form 25. Intermediate 25 loses ·H
from tetrahedral C4 to form the double bond of 26 by
crossing a barrier of 24.2 kcal mol–1. Although
the direct loss of NH3 from 26 to form adenine 28 involves a high (30.9 kcal mol–1) barrier,
inclusion of the NH3/·NH2 catalytic pair
results in barrierless abstraction of N9 hydrogen by ·NH2 of 26 to generate 27, which subsequently
loses ·NH2 through a 16.6 kcal mol–1 barrier to form adenine 28 (Figure S9).

(c) hypoxanthine (black for enol mechanism and blue for keto mechanism),
and (d) adenine. Energies of transition states and products are reported
relative to the energies of the reactants of each step using the free
reactant state as the reference state.

2.4 Formation of Isoguanine
The first
step in isoguanine formation involves the generation of urea radical
from urea P5 through the attack of ·NH2 along the barrier of 4.8 kcal mol–1 (Table S3 and Figure 8). Urea radical 29 then undergoes
attack on the cyano group of 10 through a barrier of
7.7 kcal mol–1 to form 30. The radical
center on 30 then undergoes 1,5-rearrangement in two
tandem steps involving the NH3/·NH2 pair
to generate intermediate 32 with the radical center at
oxygen (Figure 8).
Subsequently, 32 undergoes NH3/·NH2-assisted two-step 1,3 radical rearrangement to form 34 with the radical center at nitrogen. The radical 34 undergoes low (7.1 kcal mol–1) barrier
intramolecular cyclization to form 35, which further
loses hydrogen attached to C4 through a significant (35.6 kcal mol–1) barrier to form the bridging double bond characteristic
of purines (intermediate 36). 36 then undergoes
almost barrierless (0.9 kcal mol–1) ammonia-assisted
imine–enamine tautomerism to form 37. The abstraction
of hydrogen from N3 of 37 through a barrierless step
leads to intermediate 38. Although isoguanine 39 can be formed directly from 37 by the loss of ammonia
through a high-barrier (28.3 kcal mol–1) pathway
(Figure S10), the involvement of the NH3/·NH2 pair significantly reduces the barrier
for isoguanine formation by 12 kcal mol–1 (Figure 8).

2.5 Formation of Xanthine and Purine
Xanthine formation
proceeds through the attack of urea radical 29 on neutral
intermediate 13 generated in previous
steps (Figure 3) through
a 11.6 kcal mol–1 barrier to form 40, which barrierlessly releases ·NH2 to form 41 (Table S3 and Figures 9 and 12). This is followed by barrierless abstraction of hydrogen from the
amino group of 41 by ·NH2 to form 42. Intermediate 42 undergoes low-barrier (2.4
kcal mol–1) cyclization to form 43 that
subsequently loses ·H through a 29.9 kcal mol–1 barrier to form xanthine 44.

depicting the B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) relative
electronic energies (kcal mol–1) of the various
species associated with proposed mechanism of (a) isoguanine, (b)
xanthine, and (c) purine. Energies of transition states and products
are reported relative to the energies of the reactants of each step
using the free reactant state as the reference state.

In contrast, purine formation proceeds through
the attack of ·H
on 10 through a 4.9 kcal mol–1 barrier
to form 45 (Table S5 and Figures 10 and 12). This is followed by the attack of HCN (P3) on 45 through a 12.3 kcal mol–1 barrier to form 46. Intermediate 46 then
undergoes 14.0 kcal mol–1 barrier cyclization to
form radical 47. The release of hydrogen attached to
C4 of 47 through an 18.3 kcal mol–1 barrier gives purine 48. Although ·H is highly
reactive and can combine with other species once it is formed, it
only plays a catalytic role in the formation of purine, that is, it
is regenerated in the end.

3 Discussion
The present work analyses plausible free-radical pathways for the
formation of purines in a prebiotic high-energy impact scenario. Specifically,
during late heavy bombardment on early earth,14 the impact of extraterrestrial bodies would have formed radicals
that could potentially react with primary precursors, that is, cyanamide
and cyanoacetaldehyde, thereby initiating the succession of chemical
transformations leading to purine formation. Particularly, the first
step of our pathways involves the formation of 4-cyanoimidazole, a
precursor to the five-membered imidazole ring of purines. This intermediate
can be solely obtained from cyanamide and cyanoacetylene through a
series of low-barrier radical-induced reactions involving the catalytic
role of one ·OH and two NH3 groups. The formation
of 4-cyanoimidazole is followed by the creation of the six-membered
ring of various purines. Although the formation of six-membered ring
of guanine utilizes an extra cyanamide, the six-membered rings of
other purines are formed from the interaction of 4-cyanoimidazole
with secondary precursors (i.e., HCN, urea, ·H, ·OH, NH3, and ·NH2), which are either consumed or
play catalytic roles. Specifically, during the formation of the six-membered
ring of guanine or hypoxanthine from cyanamide or HCN, ·OH acts
as the source of the carbonyl group. In contrast, during adenine synthesis,
one ·NH2 acts as a source of the amino group, whereas
·OH, ·H, and another ·NH2 play a catalytic
role. On the other hand, the formation of the six-membered ring of
isoguanine involves the addition of urea and the catalytic role of
three ·NH2 groups. Similarly, the six-membered skeleton
of xanthine forms through the addition of urea and ·OH, where
·OH acts as a source of one of the carbonyl groups. Additionally,
one ·NH2 acts as a catalyst, whereas one ammonia molecule
consumed in this step is recovered in the form of ·NH2. Finally, the formation of the six-membered ring of purine involves
the addition of HCN, where ·H acts as a catalyst.

To highlight
the importance of the proposed pathways, we compared
the energy barriers associated with the previously proposed purine
formation pathways starting from formamide.16−18 In contrast
to the a 20 kcal mol–1 barrier to the cyclization
step involved in the 4-aminoimidazole intermediate formation in the
formamide-based mechanism,16 the cyclization
step leading to the 4-cyanoimidazole intermediate formation in our
study occurs barrierlessly. Further, all the steps leading to imidazole
ring formation in our proposed mechanism observe lower energy barriers
(0–21 kcal mol–1) compared to the formamide-based
synthesis (5–28 kcal mol–1).16 In addition, the barriers involved in the formation of
the six-membered ring of purines in our mechanism (up to 36 kcal mol–1) are lower than the associated barriers observed
in formamide-based pathways (up to 45 kcal mol–1).16−18 This indicates that our mechanistic proposals are
energetically more favorable as compared to formamide-derived mechanisms.
Further, despite significant (up to 36 kcal mol–1) barriers, our proposed pathways are possibly feasible in high temperature
conditions induced during the impact on the environment of primitive
earth. Further, in addition to our lower calculated barriers relative
to formamide16−18 based previous pathways, the formation of purines
from 4-cyanoimidazole precursor in our mechanism proceeds with a smaller
number of steps (4 to 10) compared to purine formation from 4-aminoimidazole
in the formamide-based mechanism (10 to 14).16−18

The potential
role of enolate chemistry in prebiotic reactions
has been previously signposted in the literature.18 Particularly, Jeilani et al. described the formation of
a carbonyl group of xanthine and isoguanine through keto–enol
tautomerization under prebiotic conditions.18 In their study, the direct formation of the carbonyl group of xanthine
and isoguanine is energetically deterred, and the pathway proceeds
only through the enol tautomer, which eventually converts into xanthine
or isoguanine. On the contrary, in our prebiotic synthesis of purines
from cyanamide and cyanoacetylene, favorable keto and enol mechanisms
pertaining to guanine and hypoxanthine formation from 4-cyanoimidazole
have been formulated. The feasible formation of guanine and hypoxanthine
from keto 11 and enol tautomer 14 is highlighted
by the barrierless formation of carbonyl groups (characteristics of
guanine and hypoxanthine) from the imidazole intermediate. Further,
comparison of the cyclization barriers of our keto tautomer-based
mechanism (8 kcal mol–1 (guanine); 9 kcal mol–1 (hypoxanthine)) with the enol tautomer-based mechanism
(16 kcal mol–1) reveals that the keto pathways are
relatively more feasible. Thus, our pathways successfully lead to
the introduction of requisite functionality (carbonyl group) in purines
through both enol and keto tautomers.

Since the free radical
reactions are not selective, the studied
pathways are competitive with the alternate routes involving radical
recombination and the formation of byproducts using competing pathways
cannot be avoided. Nevertheless, despite lower concentrations, and
in synchrony with previous pathways, involving formamide16,18 and HCN,16 simple radicals can lead to
the formation of various purines using cyanoacetylene and cyanamide,
particularly during high-energy, extraterrestrial impact event.

4 Conclusions
In summary, the present work highlights
the relevance of cyanamide
and cyanoacetylene in prebiotic purine formation through the involvement
of the 4-cyanoimidazole intermediate. The 4-cyanoimidazole formation
pathway involving these precursors proceeds in a lesser number of
steps since they are reaction-ready molecules that possess the skeletal
components of imidazole and cyano side groups. The subsequent addition
of secondary precursors such as HCN, •H, urea, or •OH
augment the 4-cyanoimidazole intermediate with an adjacent six-membered
ring and necessary functional groups to give purines. Further, such
pathways are suitable to specific extreme conditions prevailing during
the early earth environment where radicals were prevalent due to molecular
fragmentation by UV radiation13 or due
to the formation of high-energy impact plasma ensued by meteoritic
impacts.1 Particularly, in the presence
of ammonia in the early earth atmosphere,29 radicals such as ·NH2 increase the feasibility of
prebiotic purine formation by providing alternative lower barrier
routes.

The likelihood of availability of feedstock precursors
at the same
prebiotic setting is an important criterion in deciding the suitability
of a particular pathway in forming purines. While in many experimental
studies,9,37,38 cyanamide
has been demonstrated to react with cyanoacetylene under favorable,
prebiotic physicochemical conditions, the co-existence of urea and
cyanamide is highlighted from the fact that it is formed from acidic
hydrolysis of cyanamide.32 Similarly, HCN
was an important product of primitive atmospheric chemistry.5 In addition, an extreme environment such as late
heavy bombardement would ensure continuous influx of radicals that
drive such pathways and thus would likely provide an optimal background
for purine formation. Further, precursor radicals such as ·H31 and ·OH31 might
have formed photochemically from dissociation of water vapors, whereas
·NH219 would have formed
from ammonia in earth’s prebiotic atmosphere either under the
influence of UV radication or during high-energy impact events.

To conclude, we hope that the present work will motivate more extensive
study with regard to experimental, thermodynamic, and kinetic aspects
of prebiotic reactions involving cyanamide and cyanoacetylene.

5 Computational Details
All the quantum chemical calculations
were carried out using the
Gaussian 09 suite of programs.39 The reactants,
transition states, and intermediates along the reaction coordinates
associated with purine formation were subjected to gas-phase geometry
optimizations and zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE)-corrected electronic
energy calculations using B3LYP/6-311G(d,p). This method was chosen
in synchrony with recent computational studies on radical pathways
of prebiotically important reactions.14,16−18 The stationary points on the reaction surfaces were characterized
as minima (reactants, intermediates, and products) or first-order
saddle points (transition states) using vibrational frequency calculations.

Further calculations were performed to understand the method-dependence
of the derived results and confirm the feasibility of the proposed
pathways. First, B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) intrinsic reaction coordinate scans
were carried out to confirm the pathways connecting the transition
states to reactants and products of each step (Figures S11–S19). Second, to understand the effect
of dispersion corrections, calculations were re-performed on select
(i.e., imidazole formation and purine formation) mechanisms at B3LYP-D3/6-311G(d,p)
level (Tables S1 and S4). The addition
of dispersion correction leads to only a slight (up to 0.4 kcal mol–1) change in energy barriers (Tables S1 and S4). Third, to further ascertain the choice of DFT functional,
calculations were re-performed using three additional functionals
(i.e., ωB97XD, M06-2X, and B2PLYP), which reveal deviations
of 0.8–6.6 kcal mol–1 compared to all calculated
energy barriers and only up to 2.9 kcal mol–1 in
the highest barrier calculated using B3LYP (Tables S2, S3 and S5). Fourth, the influence of basis set superposition
error (BSSE) corrections on barrier heights was evaluated by recalculating
the electronic energies of the transition states of select (i.e.,
imidazole and purine) mechanisms using the counterpoise method40 (Table S7). Further,
the spin contamination in the ground state of the studied radicals
was estimated in the form of expectation value of the square of the
total spin operator <S2>, which
differs
from the ideal value (i.e., 0.7500 obtained from the s(s + 1) value for radical species) by less than
2% after spin annihilation (Table S6).
Finally, CCSD(T)/6-311G(d,p) single-point calculations performed on
B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries reveal that CCSD(T) barriers
differ from B3LYP barriers by up to 9 kcal mol–1 (Table 1). Regardless,
the addition of dispersion corrections or recalculation at CCSD(T)
does not significantly affect the conclusions derived from the present
work.

a Electronic energies
are calculated
using the gas-phase B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) optimized geometries and are
reported relative to the energies of the reactants. Each reactant
is considered in its free optimized state while calculating the electronic
energies. As a result, some of the complexed transition states have
negative energies relative to the reactants.
