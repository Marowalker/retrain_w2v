The
purpose of this study was to understand the dissolution behavior
of maize and potato starches in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate
([Emim][OAc]):water mixtures at room temperature. With an increasing
ratio of ionic liquid (IL):water, the long- and short-range ordered
structures and granule morphology of both starches were disrupted
progressively. The multiscale structure of maize starch was disrupted
completely after treatment with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4,
indicating good dissolution performance of this mixture for maize
starch. This mixture seemed to provide a balance between the viscosity
of the solvent and availability of ions to disrupt starch H-bonds.
The different dissolution behaviors of maize and potato starches in
[Emim][OAc]:water mixtures were attributed to structural differences
of the granule surfaces. Our results showed that the dissolution behavior
of starches was affected by both starch sources and properties of
[Emim][OAc]:water mixtures, which may provide guidance for the development
of green technology for processing of biopolymers with low energy
consumption.

==== Body
Introduction
Starch is an abundant,
cheap, renewable, and biodegradable natural
biopolymer. As the second most abundant biomass produced on Earth
next to cellulose, starch is used widely in food and nonfood industries.1,2 Based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns, starch is generally divided
into A-, B-, and C-type crystallites, which have different functional
properties.3,4 Starch mainly consists of two polymers of d-glucose linked by α(1,4) and α(1,6) bonds: lightly
branched amylose, which contains approximately less than 1% α(1,6)
bonds, and amylopectin with approximately 5% α(1,6) linkages.5−7 Starch granules contain an amorphous core surrounded by alternating
semicrystalline and amorphous growth rings, which are studied at structural
scales ranging from nano- to micrometer.5 Due to the strong hydrogen bonds in semicrystalline granules, starch
is generally insoluble in most traditional solvents such as water
and organic solvents,8,9 thus limiting its industrial applications.
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can dissolve starch completely under mild
conditions,10 but its application has limitations
due to the toxicity of the solvent. Other solvents such as N-methyl morpholine-N-oxide (NMMO)8,11 and molten imidazole12 have also been
used to dissolve starch, but complete dissolution either requires
a high temperature or may induce polymer degradation.

Ionic
liquids (ILs) are salts with a melting point below 100 °C
that are used as green solvents because of their nonflammability,
low vapor pressure, high thermal and chemical stability, and recyclability.1,13,14 ILs have attracted considerable
interest as solvents for polysaccharides, including cellulose, lignin,
and starch, owing to their high ability to destroy the hydrogen bonds
in these biopolymers.13,15−17 Examples of
IL solvents studied in this regard include 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
acetate,1,18−20 1-allyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride,13,19,20 and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium
chloride.21−23 The [Cl]-based ILs were used initially and are more
widely applied than other types of ILs. However, the [OAc]-based ILs
proved to be more effective in dissolving polysaccharides24−26 and were found not to cause acid hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds
due to the absence of corrosive [Cl] anions.1,21,22 To reduce the quantity of IL needed and
to develop mild dissolution conditions, mixtures of water:ILs have
been studied in the dissolution of polysaccharides at room temperature.
These studies showed that starch or lignin can be dissolved in aqueous
ILs at room temperature by modulating the structure of cations and
anions or the water:IL ratio.27−29 For example, maize starch can
be dissolved at room temperature in mixtures of [Emim][OAc]:water.28

The changes in morphology, crystalline
lamellae, and rheological
properties of maize starches were studied during dissolution in [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures.28 However, there is little information
on the underlying multiscale structural changes that occur in starch
when it is treated with different mass ratios of water:IL mixtures
at room temperature. In our previous study, the dissolution behavior
of maize starch in mixtures of water:[Cl]-based ILs was investigated
by characterizing the structural changes of starch before and after
dissolution.27 However, the structural
changes of maize starch and the dissolution behavior of other starches
in aqueous [OAc]-based ILs have not been studied. Therefore, the aim
of this work was to investigate the multiscale structural changes
of normal maize and potato starches during dissolution in [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures. These two starches were chosen because of their different
structures and properties and wide industrial applications. The results
contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the dissolution
behavior of starches in different [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures. This
knowledge will help underpin the design of starch-based materials
with desirable functional properties, leading to novel green chemistry
applications for this important natural biopolymer.

Materials and
Methods
Materials
Native maize starch (NMS, 10.2% moisture,
26.5% amylose content) was purchased from Shanghai Macklin Biochemical
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Normal potato starch (NPS, 12.2% moisture,
21.3% amylose content) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co.
(St. Louis, Missouri, U.S.A.). High-purity (95%, ≤ 0.5% moisture
content) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate ([Emim][OAc]) was purchased
from Nuowei Chemical Technology Co., Ltd. (Wuhu, Anhui, China). The
chemical structure and 1H and 13C NMR spectra
of [Emim][OAc] are shown in the appendices. Deionized water was used
in all experiments. All other chemical reagents were of analytical
grade.

Treatment of Starch in Different IL/Water Mixtures
The 10% (w/w) starch suspensions were prepared by dispersing starches
in respective aqueous ionic liquid systems ([Emim][OAc]:water mass
ratios of 2:8, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 8:2, and 10:0). The suspensions were
stirred magnetically for 2 h at room temperature (22–23 °C),
and after which, four volumes of absolute ethanol were added with
stirring. The starch suspensions were centrifuged at 4500g for 15 min, and the precipitated starch was washed three times using
absolute ethanol to remove the residual [Emim][OAc]. The resulting
starch samples were dried in an oven at 30 °C for 24 h, ground
into a powder, and passed through a 100 mesh sieve. The starch samples
were referred to as MAC- or PAC-n:m, representing maize or potato starch that was treated in [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures at a mass ratio of n:m.

Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction (XRD)
The crystallinity
of starch samples was examined using an X-ray diffractometer (D8 ADVANCE,
Bruker, Germany) operating at 40 kV and 40 mA. The starch samples
were equilibrated in a chamber over saturated NaCl solution at 25
°C for one week before analysis. The starch samples were scanned
from 4° to 40° (2θ) at a speed of 1 °/min and
step size of 0.02°. The relative crystallinity was quantified
using TOPAS 5.0 software (Bruker, Germany), as described by Shang
et al.30

Scanning Electron Microscopy
(SEM)
The morphology of
starch samples was observed by a scanning electron microscope (SU1510,
Hitachi, Japan). The specimens were attached to an aluminum stub using
conductive tape and coated with gold before imaging. The accelerating
voltage was 5 kV.

Light Microscopy (LM)
A light microscope
(DM-400 M-LED,
Leica, Germany) was used to observe the starch samples under normal
and polarized light modes. Approximately 10 mg of each sample was
weighed into a plastic tube, and 1 mL of deionized water was added
to suspend the sample. One drop of the suspension was applied onto
a microscope slide and covered with a coverslip for imaging.30

Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)
The thermal
properties of starch samples were performed using a differential scanning
calorimeter (200 F3, Netzsch, Germany) equipped with a thermal analysis
data station. The sample preparation and heating procedures were as
described in Wang and Copeland.31 A starch
sample (3 mg, dry base) was weighed into an aluminum pan, and then
distilled water was added to obtain a sample:water ratio of 1:3 (w/w).
The sample pan was sealed, equilibrated at room temperature for 12
h, and scanned from 20 to 100 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
An empty pan was used as the reference. The onset temperatures (To), peak temperatures (Tp), conclusion temperatures (Tc), and melting enthalpy (ΔH) were calculated
using Proteus analysis software.

Attenuated Total Reflectance
Fourier Transform Infrared (ATR-FTIR)
Spectroscopy
The ATR-FTIR spectra of starch samples were
obtained using a Tensor FT-IR spectrometer (IS50, Thermo Fisher Scientific,
U.S.A.) equipped with a DLATGS detector. The sample preparation and
operation conditions were mentioned in Wang, et al.32 with minor modifications. Spectra were recorded from 4000
to 400 cm–1 against an empty cell as background,
with an accumulation of 64 scans and a resolution of 4 cm–1. The ratio of absorbances at 1047/1022 cm–1, calculated
using software OMNIC 9.2, was used to estimate the short-range molecular
order of starch samples.

Laser Confocal Micro-Raman (LCM-Raman) Spectroscopy
The Raman spectra of starch samples were determined using a Renishaw
Invia Raman microscope system (Renishaw, Gloucestershire, United Kingdom)
equipped with a Leica microscope (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany).
A 785 nm green diode laser source was used.33 Spectra in the range of 3200–100 cm–1 were
collected with a resolution of approximately 7 cm–1. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the band at 480 cm–1, which was used to characterize the short-range ordered
structure of starch, was obtained by software WiRE 2.0.

Viscosity of
[Emim][OAc]:Water Mixtures
Rheological
measurements of aqueous ionic liquid solutions were performed on a
MCR 302 rheometer (Anton Paar GmbH, Austria). The sample preparation
and operation conditions were according to Liu and Budtova18 with minor modifications. The measuring system
had a cone-plate geometry with a diameter of 40 mm and cone angle
of 4°. The steady-state viscosity of each solution was determined
as a function of shear rate from 10 to 500 s–1 at
23 °C. In order to prevent the absorption and evaporation of
water vapor, the silicone oil was placed around the edge of the measuring
cell.

Low-Field Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (LF-NMR)
The LF-NMR
experiments were performed on a 0.53 T (20 MHz) NMI20-025 V-I NMR
analyzer (Niumag, Shanghai, China) as described by Li et al.34 with minor modifications. Approximately 4.5
g of the aqueous ionic liquid mixtures was placed in 15 mm NMR glass
tubes before moving to the NMR probe. Transverse relaxation (T2) was measured by the Carr–Purcell–Meiboom–Gill
(CPMG) sequence at 32 °C with a time of 500 μs between
90 and 180° pulses (τ-value). Data was acquired from 15000
echoes at four scan repetitions, and the repetition time between two
successive scans was set to 15 s.

Statistical Analysis
All experiments were performed
at least in triplicate, and the results are reported as mean values
and standard deviations. In the case of XRD, only one measurement
was conducted. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Duncan’s
tests (P < 0.05) was conducted using the SPSS
19.0 statistical software program (SPSS Inc. Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.).

Results and Discussion
Long-Range Ordered Structure of Starch Samples
Determined by
XRD
Native maize starch exhibited a typical A-type diffraction
pattern with strong diffraction peaks at 15°, 17°, 18°,
and 23° (2θ) (Figure 1A, NMS). The weak diffraction peak at around 20°
(2θ) was assigned to the endogenous starch–lipid complex.
Maize starch treated with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4 showed
an amorphous diffraction pattern (Figure 1A, MAC-6:4), indicating complete disruption
of the long-range crystallinity of the starch by this solvent mixture.
Similar results were also observed in a previous study.28 In contrast, the XRD patterns of maize starch
after treatment with the other [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures were similar
to that of native starch, although there were small gradual decreases
in crystallinity from 22.8% for native starch to 18.3% for starch
treated with undiluted IL (Table 1).

Native potato starch displayed a
typical B-type XRD pattern with
five clear peaks at 5.6°, 15°, 17°, 21.9°, and
23.7° (2θ) (Figure 1B, NPS). The crystallinity of potato starch decreased gradually
from 35.1 to 24.2% with increasing IL:water ratio, demonstrating a
gradual disruption of the long-range ordered structure in potato starch.

The crystalline structural changes of starches after treatment
with [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures were also confirmed by the 2D views
of XRD diffraction patterns (Figure 1C,D). With increasing [Emim][OAc]:water ratio, the
intensity of diffraction peaks of maize (Figure 1C) and potato starches (Figure 1D) gradually weakened, with
the exception of the absence of diffraction peaks of maize starch
after treatment with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4.

Short-Range
Ordered Structure of Starch Samples Determined by
ATR-FTIR and LCM-Raman Spectroscopy
The changes of the short-range
ordered structure in starch after treatment with [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures was monitored by ATR-FTIR and LCM-Raman spectroscopy. The
ATR-FTIR spectra in the range of 1200 to 800 cm–1 of maize and potato starches are presented in Figure 2A,B, respectively, and the ratios of absorbances
at 1047/1022 cm–1 are shown in Table 1. Maize starch treated with
the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4 showed the lowest value of IR
ratio of absorbances at 1047/1022 cm–1 (0.54) compared
to native maize starch (0.73), indicating that the short-range ordered
structure was greatly disrupted. Maize starch treated with other [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures presented decreasing IR ratios of absorbances at 1047/1022
cm–1 from 0.73 to 0.63 with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water
ratio, indicating the gradual and lesser degree of disruption of short-range
ordered structure. The ratio of the absorbances at 1047/1022 cm–1 of potato starch decreased slightly from 0.82 to
0.70 with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water ratio, indicating the gradual
disruption of the short-range ordered structure.

aqueous ionic liquids. (A): FT-IR spectra of maize starch samples,
(B): FT-IR spectra of potato starch samples, (C): LCM-Raman spectra
of maize starch samples, and (D): LCM-Raman spectra of potato starch
samples.

The LCM-Raman spectra of samples
showed five characteristic bands
at 480, 865, 943, 1264, and 2900 cm–1 (Figure 2C,D), which are related
to δ (CH2), νs (C1–O–C4), νs (C1–O–C5),
skeletal (C–C–O), and ν (C–H) modes, respectively.31,35,36 The band at 480 cm–1 is sensitive to changes of the short-range ordered structure of
starch, with a smaller FWHM value indicating a greater degree of structural
order.32,35−37 Similar to FTIR results,
the short-range ordered structure of the two starch samples determined
by the FWHM of the band at 480 cm–1 (Table 1) was disrupted increasingly
with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water ratio, with the exception of maize
starch treated with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4. A much higher
FWHM value for maize starch treated with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture
of 6:4 indicated the greater disruption of the short-range ordered
structure of starch.

Granular Morphology of Starch Samples
The SEM and LM
images of native starch and starch samples treated with different
[Emim][OAc]:water mixtures are shown in Figure 3. Native maize starch granules were irregularly
shaped with a rough surface containing a few indentations (Figure 3A), whereas potato
starch granules were more round with a smooth surface (Figure 3H). Under polarized light,
native maize and potato starch granules displayed clear birefringent
patterns with the characteristic Maltese cross (Figure 3A2,H2).

Figure 3 (A–N) Representative scanning electron
microscopy and light
microscopy images under (A1–N1) normal and (A2–N2) polarized
light modes of (A) native maize and (H) potato starch and (B–G,
I–N) starch samples after treatment with different aqueous
ionic liquids. (B–G) and (I–N) indicate maize and potato
starch samples treated with different aqueous ionic liquids at IL:water
ratios of 2:8, 4:6, 5:5, 6:4, 8:2, and 10:0, respectively.

The SEM images showed that the surface morphology
of maize and
potato starch granules did not appear to be greatly affected by treatment
with IL:water mixtures (Figure 3B–G,I–N). Birefringent granules indicative of
crystallinity were observed to become increasingly blurred (maize
starch) or to decrease in size (potato starch) with polarized light
microscopy for both types of starch, except for maize starch treated
with the 6:4 [Emim][OAc]:water mixture (Figure 3E2). No birefringent maize starch granules
were evident after treatment with the 6:4 mixture, although the granule
contours were still visible (Figures 3E1,E2).

Thermal Properties of Starch Samples
The DSC thermograms
and the corresponding thermal transition parameters of starch samples
are presented in Figure 4 and Table 2, respectively.
Thermal transition temperatures (To, Tp, and Tc) of native
maize and potato starches were 65.9, 71.5, and 76.4 °C and 61.1,
65.7, and 71.7 °C, respectively. The enthalpy changes of gelatinization
were 11.5 and 16.3 J/g for maize and potato starches, respectively.

The endothermic
peak (Tp) of maize
starch shifted gradually to higher temperatures as the [Emim][OAc]:water
ratio increased from 2:8 to 5:5 (Figure 4A). No peak was detected with the 6:4 IL:water
mixture. The Tp increased further with
the 8:2 mixture but then shifted to a lower temperature after treatment
with undiluted [Emim][OAc] (Figure 4A). Increasing Tp is indicative
of IL treatment disrupting less stable starch crystallites and leaving
behind more stable crystallites with a higher melting temperature.32,37 The enthalpy change of the maize starch samples decreased gradually
with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water ratio, with the exception of the
starch treated with the 6:4 [Emim][OAc]:water mixture, which did not
show an enthalpy change. These results indicated that the crystalline
structure was disrupted increasingly with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water
ratio and that no crystallites remained in the sample treated with
the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture of 6:4.

The endothermic peak of
the DSC profile of potato starch shifted
gradually from 65.7 to 62.4 °C with increasing [Emim][OAc]:water
ratio, and the enthalpy change of gelatinization decreased from 16.3
to 12.5 J/g. The decreased Tp of potato
starch after treatment suggested that the stable crystallites were
disrupted preferentially, leading to the lower melting temperature
of residual less stable crystallites. The changes in the ΔH value of starches after treatments were generally consistent
with the results from XRD, ATR-FTIR, and LCM-Raman.

Rheological
Properties of [Emim][OAc]:Water Mixtures
The viscosities
of the different [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures were
constant over a range of shear rates (Figure 5). As the [Emim][OAc]:water mass ratio increased
from 0 to 5:5, the viscosity increased only slightly from 0.8 to 4.4
mPa·s. However, the viscosity more than doubled to 10.0 mPa·s
at an [Emim][OAc]:water ratio of 6:4 and then increased again to 21.4
mPa·s at a ratio of 8:2. Undiluted [Emim][OAc] had the highest
viscosity of 66.0 mPa·s.

Figure 5 Viscosity–shear rate dependence for [Emim][OAc]/water
solutions
of various concentrations at ambient temperature (23 °C).

T2 Distribution of [Emim][OAc]:Water
Mixtures
The state of water molecules in a solution can be
differentiated from the distribution of transverse relaxation time T2 into strongly bound water (T21, 0.01–1 ms), weakly bound water (T22, 1–100 ms), and free water (T23, 100–10000 ms).38 The T2 distribution of [Emim][OAc]:water
mixtures (Figure 6)
showed a gradual decrease in the mobility of water molecules with
increasing IL in the mixtures, which could be due to water molecules
being increasingly bound by IL and the effects of higher viscosity.
However, except for undiluted IL and, to a lesser extent, the IL:water
mixture of 8:2, the water molecules in the aqueous IL mixtures were
freely mobile.

Figure 6 CPMG proton distributions of water molecules in aqueous
ionic liquids.

General Discussion
The present study has shown from
analyses at multiple scales that the structure of maize starch was
disrupted completely after treatment with the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture
of 6:4. As shown previously, this indicates good dissolution of maize
starch in this aqueous IL solution.28 We
propose that this 6:4 ratio of IL:water represents a “sweet
spot”; at lower ratios, there is not enough IL to break sufficient
hydrogen bonds in starch to cause complete structural disruption,
whereas the low mobility of water molecules in high-viscosity IL:water
mixtures reduces the penetration of IL into starch granules (Figures 5 and 6).

Similar behavior was not observed with potato starch,
which could be due to its distinct surface morphology. Maize starch
has many surface pores and channels, which may facilitate the penetration
of the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture into granules. In contrast, potato
starch granules have a smooth, hard outer surface, which may reduce
the penetration of the [Emim][OAc]:water mixture. The gradual disruption
of potato starch structure suggested that the dissolution occurred
from the surface, as shown by the increasing degree of disruption
of the starch granule surface observed by SEM (Figure 3). In addition, repulsion of acetate ions
by negatively charged phosphate groups in potato starch may be another
reason for differences in the dissolution behavior between potato
and maize starches .13,22

Conclusions
The
multiscale structure of both maize and potato starches was
progressively disrupted at room temperature (22–23 °C)
by treatment with [Emim][OAc]:water mixtures containing increasing
mass-ratio amounts of the IL. Treatment of maize starch with the [Emim][OAc]:water
mixture at a ratio of 6:4 resulted in complete structural disruption
of the granules. The effectiveness of this particular mixture in dissolving
maize starch is attributed to surface morphology differences in maize
starch, vis a vis potato starch granules, and the balance between
the amount of IL versus viscosity of the various mixtures. These findings
will be useful for developing protocols for the use of ILs as solvents
for starch in novel applications for this important natural biopolymer.
