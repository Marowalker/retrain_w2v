The effect of a Lewis
base (LB) on the nucleophilic attack on chalcogeniranium
(chalcogen = sulfur and selenium) cations, the so-called LB activation
of a Lewis acid, has been studied coupling natural orbital for chemical
valence decomposition of the orbital interaction energy with charge
displacement analysis. This methodology provides a detailed and accurate
description of all the interactions (LB···chalcogen,
chalcogen···olefin and olefin···ammonia)
present in the system and leads to a deeper understanding of how they
influence each other at all stages of the reaction: reactant complex,
transition state, and product complex. In particular, the bond between
the chalcogen and the olefin has been decomposed in terms of σ
donation/π back-donation and the bond components quantified.
This allowed determination of a linear relationship between the activation
barrier of the nucleophilic attack and the net amount of charge donated
by the olefin to the chalcogen.

Introduction
The interaction between
a cationic ChR+ (Ch = S or Se)
moiety and an unsaturated CC bond has been studied since 1950s,1,2 when the addition of PhChCl to polar and nonpolar alkenes was discovered.
Such Lewis acids (LAs), called thiiranium and seleniranium ions, are
important intermediates in many chemical processes3−5 and have been
isolated and characterized by NMR spectroscopy6−8 and, in some
cases, by X-ray diffractometry.9−14 The interaction of selenium with an olefin has been often rationalized
in terms of the Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson framework,15,16 with M ← olefin σ donation corresponding to the interaction
between the olefin π system and an empty Se p orbital (or a
σ* Ch–X orbital for RChX) and the M → olefin π
back-donation being the model for interaction between a chalcogen
p lone pair and the olefin π* orbital (Scheme 1).17 The back-donation
concept has been recently applied also to selenium in selenoureas18 and phosphine chalcogenides.19

Scheme 1 Orbital Interactions between the RSe+ Moiety
and an Olefin
In particular, the
Se ← olefin σ donation makes the
olefin electron-poor and suitable for a nucleophilic attack.1 It has been recently observed that the presence
of a Lewis base (LB), generally soft and in many cases containing
another chalcogen as, for example, R3PCh (Ch = oxygen,
sulfur or selenium), strongly increases the rate and the yield of
the nucleophilic attack (LB activation of LA, LBLA).20,21 Even more importantly, if the LB is chiral it can induce excellent
stereoselectivity to the entire process.22−24 The explanation
for the stereoselectivity relies on the strong bond between the LA
and the LB and the stability of the chalcogen–olefin interaction,
which makes the configuration of the transition state (TS) stable
enough to allow an efficient transmission of the chiral information.

A theoretical analysis of the LBLA effect20,25,26 concluded that, despite the LB →
LA donation of electron density, the electrophilicity of LA increases
because of the increase of the coordination number and the redistribution
of the charge to peripheral atoms bound to the electrophilic center
(spillover effect27).

The recently
introduced charge displacement (CD) function analysis28 allows an extremely detailed description of
the metal–ligand coordinative bonds29 and an elegant rationalization of some experimental properties of
complexes, such as the infrared spectrum of a coordinated carbonyl
ligand,30−32 the rotational barrier33 and the geometrical arrangement34 of
acyclic carbenes, and the 13C NMR chemical shift of cyclic
carbenes.35 If the adduct shows enough
elements of symmetry, the bond components can be decomposed according
to their irreducible representations,36 otherwise an effective decomposition can be achieved according to
the natural orbitals for chemical valence (NOCV) framework.37−39

Given the similarity between the seleniranium cation and a
transition
metal complex, it is interesting to apply such methodology to the
adduct depicted in Scheme 2, as the CD methodology has already been shown to give reliable
results for chalcogen-bonded adducts.40 Because in this case the adduct does not show any symmetry, the
bond contributions will be decomposed through the NOCV method: the
analysis of the electron density deformation (Δρk′ maps) allows visualization for each contribution of the regions
in which the electron density decreases or increases upon adduct formation
and hence the electronic fluxes between the two fragments. These fluxes
can be quantified by integrating the Δρk′ functions
(CD functions), obtaining both the direction of the flux and its intensity.

Scheme 2 Systems Studied in the Present Work
In this “proof of concept” paper, the chemical
system
has been reduced to a minimal model, containing all the elements of
the real process (a base, a chalcogeniranium cation, and a nucleophile),
in order to easily vary the nature of the LB and LA and follow evolution
of the reaction for each combination. Systems H3PCh2···(PhCh1)+···(C2H4) (Scheme 2) were chosen to model the adducts interacting with the prototypical
nucleophile ammonia. For each adduct, the reactant complex (RC), TS,
and product complex (PC) of the nucleophilic attack have been optimized
and decomposed in different ways through the NOCV-CD methodology,
in order to analyze all interactions and to understand how they influence
each other. The results presented here demonstrate that the NOCV-CD
methodology is an appropriate tool to understand the LALB concept,
especially when coupled with other computational tools such as energy
decomposition analysis (EDA) and natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis,
and is potentially able to contribute to the rational design of the
best LB for a specific real case.

Results and Discussion
The first system discussed is the seleniranium cation, [PhSe(C2H4)]+ (Se1). The latter
can be considered as an olefin “coordinated” through
its π system on a cationic selenium, which is bound only to
one substituent (the phenyl group). According to the NBO analysis,
such a resonance structure counts for the 6.2%, whereas the most important
one is obviously the one in which the selenium has a single bond with
each carbon of the olefin and the C–C bond of the latter is
single (79.0%). Nonetheless, the chosen fragmentation of the system
is useful to analyze the electronic rearrangement upon the formation
of the Se···C=C bond.

In this framework,
the association energy (Eass), which is
the difference of electronic energy between
the adduct and the relaxed fragments (the olefin and the [PhSe]+ cation), is −57.6 kcal/mol. According to the EDA (see
Theoretical Details),41Eass can be decomposed in the interaction energy, Eint, which is the difference of energy between
the adduct and the unrelaxed fragments (−75.8 kcal/mol), and
the deformation energy, Edef, which is
the energy needed to distort the fragment from their relaxed geometry
to the geometry they assume in the adduct (18.2 kcal/mol). Eint can be further decomposed in the following
components: orbital (Eoi), steric (Est), and dispersion (Edisp) energies, −222.9, 152.6, and −5.3 kcal/mol,
respectively (Table 1). It is evident that the bond between the selenium and the olefin
is quite strong and dominated by the orbital contribution.

More information
can be derived from the decomposition of Eoi in the natural orbital for chemical valence
(NOCV) framework.38 Such a decomposition
leads to a series of Δρk′ functions, which are essentially
density difference maps (red = depletion, blue = accumulation) between
a specific NOCV pair (see Theoretical Details). Generally, only a
few functions (k < 4) are enough to completely
characterize the interaction.

In the case of Se1 and using the same fragmentation
scheme used for the EDA, Δρ0′ describes the formation of the
two C–Se bonds, with depletion regions at the π system
of the olefin and accumulation regions at the Se atom. The phenyl
ring is polarized upon formation of the bond and becomes more electron-rich,
especially in the ipso, ortho, and para positions (Figure 1a). The energy associated with
Δρ0′ (ΔE0) is a large part of the total
orbital energy Eoi, −142.3 out
of −222.9 kcal/mol (64%).

and depletion of electron density, respectively. (b) Total CD curve
and its most relevant CDk components.
Black dots indicate the z position of the atomic
nuclei. A yellow vertical band indicates the boundary between the
fragments.

On the other hand, Δρ1′ describes
a flux from the selenium
to the olefin. Analysis of the shape of the regions demonstrates that
the source of the electron density (red-colored depletion regions
in Figure 1a) is the
filled px orbital of the selenium and
the recipient is the π* orbital of the olefin. This component
could be called “back-donation” if a transition metal
were present instead of the selenium, and indeed, the back-donation
concept has been occasionally invoked in chalcogen chemistry.17−19 The energy associated with Δρ1′ is smaller than ΔE0, but still significant, −53.5 kcal/mol.

Finally, Δρ2′ and Δρ3′ describe very weak components,
in which the two fragments are electrostatically polarized.

Such components can be quantified through the integration of the
Δρk′ functions along the z axis (defined as the axis passing through the selenium and the middle
point of the double C=C bond), using the CD methodology,28 obtaining the corresponding CDk functions. The value of the CDk function at the isodensity boundary36 between the two fragments is called CTk and expresses, in electrons, the charge transfer associated with
the kth bond contribution. For Se1,
CTk values are 0.733, −0.435, 0.003,
and −0.002 for k going from 0 to 3, respectively.
These numbers are consistent with the qualitative picture presented
above: k = 0 and 1 have opposite signs because the
direction of the flux is opposite, k = 2 and 3 have
no practical impact on the chemical bond. For k >
3, the contributions are negligible, as demonstrated by the corresponding
eigenvalues (φk = 1.258 for k = 0, smaller than 0.11 and rapidly decaying for k > 3, see Theoretical Details)
and the energy associated with each contribution (ΔEk, −142.3 and −3.3 kcal/mol
for k = 0 and 4, respectively, see Supporting Information). The total charge transfer from the
olefin to the selenium cationic moiety is 0.303 e.

It is important
to note here that this CD analysis has been shown
to be very stable with respect to the choice of exchange-correlation
functional approximation used.34 Also in
the present case, we find that the use of a hybrid functional instead
of a generalized gradient approximation (GGA) one does not significantly
change the results (Supporting Information).

Se1 can now be attacked by a nucleophile, such
as
NH3, to form the product, [PhSeCH2CH2NH3]+ (Se1_PC, Figure 2). Generally, the nucleophile
loses a proton after the attack, which in this case would give a selenoether
with a γ-amino functionality, and the proton is taken by the
anion from the seleniranium cation. As the first step of the reaction, Se1 and NH3 form a stable complex (Se1_RC) in which the ammonia is still far from the olefin (C1–N
distance = 2.357 Å), but already close enough to induce an asymmetry
in the two Se–C bonds, which are Se–C1 = 2.294 and Se–C2
= 2.016 Å, Δd = d(Se–C1)
– d(Se–C2) = 0.278 Å for Se1_RC. In the TS (Se1_TS) geometry, the ammonia
is closer to C1 (2.208 Å), the asymmetry is more pronounced (Δd = 0.484 Å) and ΔG⧧ = 2.9 kcal/mol with respect to Se1_RC. Finally, in
the product (Se1_PC), the C1–N bond is formed
(1.550 Å) and the selenium is bound only to C2 (Se–C2
= 1.986 Å, Δd = 0.850 Å), with ΔG = −6.3 kcal/mol (Figure 2).

Decomposing the system into fragments
[PhSe]+ and [(C2H4)(NH3)] as described above, the effect
of the ammonia on the Se···C2H4 bond can be quantified in detail. First, the EDA reveals that the
Se···C2H4 interaction is stronger,
but this is not due to an enhancement of the orbital contribution,
which decreases in absolute value by 23 kcal/mol (Table 1). Likely, the addition of the
electron-rich ammonia makes the electrostatic contribution between
the two fragments more negative. As well, the presence of the ammonia
causes an increase in the Se–C1 bond length to 2.292 Å,
reducing the Pauli repulsion between the two fragments. Both effects
lead to a decreased Est and an increased Eint despite the less favorable Eoi contribution.

From the orbital point of view,
Δρ0′, in addition to the regions
discussed above, also shows a depletion region at the nitrogen atom
(Supporting Information), indicative of
a N → C1 polarization and giving a larger CT0 value
(0.789 e). Δρ1′ shows essentially the same regions
discussed before, but as the olefin is further from the selenium,
the back-donation is less effective, resulting in a smaller absolute
value of CT1, −0.316 e (Figure 3).

[PhSe]+···[(C2H4)(NH3)] bond in Se1_RC (solid lines), Se1_TS (dashed lines), and Se1_PC (dotted lines). Black dots
indicate the z position or position range of the
atomic nuclei. A yellow vertical band indicates the range of boundary
between the fragments.

More in general, the NOCV-CD analysis enables following the
electronic
changes that occur in the system during the nucleophilic attack. A
similar approach has been used for the gold(I)-catalyzed functionalization
of alkynes37 and the formation of noncovalent
pnicogen adducts.42

In particular,
CT0 passes from 0.789 e for Se1_RC to 0.820
for Se1_TS and 0.842 for Se1_PC (Figure 3). It should
be noted that in Se1_RC the charge transfer is due to
two carbon atoms, whereas in Se1_PC to only C2 contributes.
Therefore, the Se ← C2 donation is much larger and, in forming
the σ bond, amounts to almost 1 e.

Conversely, CT1 passes from −0.316 e for Se1_RC to −0.217
and −0.075 e for Se1_TS and Se1_PC, respectively (Figure 3). Also, here the formation of the Se–C2
σ bond at the expense of the interaction with the π electrons
of the olefin is evident: in the former, the back-donation is expected
to be not important, as the σ*(C1C2) orbital is high in energy.
Likely, the residual, small Se → C2 electronic flux can be
explained by the presence of the ammonium moiety, which hosts a formal
positive charge and electrostatically attracts (polarizes) the lone
pair of the selenium. The polarization of the selenium is also evident
from the electrostatic potential map (Supporting Information), which shows a σ hole near the selenium
atom (Supporting Information).43,44

Now, the effect of the LB on this LA-catalyzed reaction can
be
studied. First, the effect of a model phosphine oxide, PH3O, will be discussed. Similar species, together with phosphine sulfides
and selenides, have been used with success in this type of reaction.21

The interaction between Se1 and PH3O is
quite strong and the Gibbs free energy of the adduct OSe1 is −6.8 kcal/mol with respect to the isolated components,
denoting a good stability. The stability of this interaction allowed
the use of a chiral auxiliary LB to effect enantioselective reactions.24 In the optimized geometry of OSe1, the O–Se distance is 2.511 Å and the Se–O–P
angle is 134.7°. The EDA reveals that Eass is −18.3 kcal/mol, Eint is −19.6 kcal/mol, and Edef is
1.3 kcal/mol. The decomposition of Eint leads to the following values of Eoi, Est, and Edisp: −16.7, 4.4, and −7.3 kcal/mol, respectively. The
NOCV decomposition of Eoi shows that in
this case Δρ0′ contributes −10.2 kcal/mol, much more than
the other ones (−1.9, −1.3, and −1.0 for k = 1, 2, and 3, respectively). Analysis of the 3D maps
of Δρ0′ reveals a depletion region at oxygen, an accumulation
region between O and Se, a polarization pattern (depletion/accumulation)
at the selenium atom and, finally, an accumulation region at the olefin
(Figure 4a). This is
coherent with a PH3O → Se1 charge transfer
from the filled pz orbital of the oxygen (lone pair) to
the σ*(Se–C) orbitals.40 Also,
the π electrons of the P=O bonds participate in the donation,
lowering the Mayer bond order,45 which
passes from 1.97 (bond distance 1.491 Å) for the isolated moiety
to 1.74 (bond distance 1.510 Å) in OSe1, similar
to results reported for selenourea.46 Δρ1′ is mainly
localized on the PH3O moiety and reveals the polarization
of the π electrons of the P=O bond toward the oxygen
atom. The other contributions (k > 1) describe
similar,
weaker polarization contributions.

accumulation and depletion of electron density, respectively and (b)
corresponding integrated CD0 and CD1 components.
Black dots indicate the z position of the atomic
nuclei. A yellow vertical band indicates the boundary between the
fragments.

The integration of the contributions
quantifies the O →
Se CT0 as 0.071 e. Furthermore, the presence of the LB
induces an additional Se → Colef charge shift of
0.054 e.

From an orbital point of view, the LB donates its electron
density
to the empty p orbital of the selenium, but the olefin also competes
for the same orbital, forming a 3-center-4 electron bond.47

As the ammonia approaches, OSe1_RC forms, with a Gibbs
free energy of 1 kcal/mol with respect to the isolated OSe1 and NH3. The N–C1 distance is 2.808, 0.45 Å
longer than in the absence of the LB. This can be explained by the
accumulation of electron density on the olefin induced by PH3O (Figure 4), which
likely makes the electrostatic interaction with the ammonia weaker.
This is confirmed by the natural population analysis for Se1 and OSe1, as the partial charge on the C1 passes from
−0.449 to −0.459 e, respectively. In addition to this,
the p character of the C1–C2 antibonding orbital increases
from 67.5 to 68.4%, making the interaction with the lone pair of the
ammonia less favorable. As the presence of the ammonia tends to make Eint stronger, as seen for Se1_RC, it is reasonable that if the ammonia is further away, Eint will decrease.

A similar effect, but less effective,
is also exerted by the ammonia
on the LB, as the O–Se distance changes from 2.511 to 2.566
Å. Noteworthy, the Se···olefin interaction is
weaker in the presence of the LB, with Eint passing from −93.0 kcal/mol in Se1_RC to −75.6
in OSe1_RC (Supporting Information).

In OSe1_TS, the N–C1 distance is 2.298
Å,
slightly longer than in the absence of LB, and O–Se is 2.587
Å. Interestingly, in OSe1 the oxygen of the C1–Se–O
and C2–Se–O angles are very similar, 160.3° and
158.7°, respectively, while in OSe1_TS the former
is smaller than the latter, 152.7 and 169.1°, respectively. This
indicates an incipient σ hole opposite to C2, as discussed before.43 The Gibbs free energy of OSe1_TS is 3.7 kcal/mol, 0.8 kcal/mol higher than in the absence of PH3O (see later and Figure 5). For OSe1_PC, the Gibbs free energy
is −2.6 kcal/mol and the C2–Se–O angle is 171.6,
quite similar to the 180° typical of σ-hole interactions.44 In this case, from the orbital point of view,
the LB donates its electronic energy to the σ*(Se–C2)
orbital (ω bonding48,49).

Gibbs energy and total occupancy of the NBO antibonding orbitals σ*(Se–C1)
and σ*(Se–C2).

It is interesting to compare for different PH3Ch2 moieties the effect of chalcogen variation on both
the bond
components and the activation barrier. In fact, experimental studies
revealed that passing from light to heavy chalcogen atoms, the yield
of the selenolactonization increases.21 For this reason, the Ch2···Se and Se···C
bond analyses and the reaction paths have been calculated using Ch2 = O, S, and Se. Comparing the three different RC geometries
(OSe1_RC, SSe1_RC, and SeSe1_RC), many things can be noted: the C1–N distance decreases as
the chalcogen mass increases (2.808, 2.721, and 2.679 Å for Ch2 = O, S, and Se, respectively) and the Δd increases (0.061, 0.097, and 0.128 Å, respectively), making
the RC more and more similar to the geometry of the TS. In addition
to this, the Eint values decrease from
−75.6 to −59.4 and −51.7 kcal/mol for Ch2 = O, S, and Se, respectively (Table 1): the Se–olefin interaction is weaker
in the presence of heavier Ch2, as the Se–olefin
distances increases.

All these facts impact on the Gibbs free
energies of the TS structures,
which decrease as the chalcogen weight increases: 3.7, 2.0, and 1.3
kcal/mol for Ch2 = O, S, and Se, respectively (Figure 5a), in qualitative
agreement with the experimental results.21

It has to be noted that ΔG⧧ for the “assisted” attack becomes smaller than in
the absence of an LB only for the heavier chalcogen S and Se. According
to NBO second-order perturbation theory interaction energy analysis,
the LB donates electron density directly into the antibonding orbitals
σ*(Se–C1) and σ*(Se–C2) (ω bonding:
the more electron density the LB donates to Se, the weaker the Se–olefin
bond becomes). The population of these orbitals favors the reaction,
and according to NBO results the lowest population (0.29 e) is indeed
seen with PH3O. In the absence of the LB the population
is 0.39 e and in the presence of PH3S and PH3Se becomes 0.45 and 0.56 e, respectively. As a confirmation, the
total population of σ*(Se–C1) and σ*(Se–C2)
orbitals is seen to correlate linearly with ΔG⧧ (r2 = 0.974, Figure 5b).

On the
other hand, the Ch2···Se interaction
becomes stronger as the weight of Ch2 increases, from −17.2
to −18.4 and −21.1 for Ch2 = O, S, and Se,
respectively, due to a large increase of the orbital contribution
(Supporting Information). In other words,
the LB···Se bond becomes progressively more covalent
and less electrostatic in nature. This stabilization is of prime importance
in the LBLA effect and likely prevents the decomposition of the active
species. The same change in bonding can be quantitatively measured
using the NOCV-CD analysis with the decomposition [PH3Ch2]···[(PhSe)(C2H4)(NH3)]+. In this case, the value of CT0 changes
from −0.062 to −0.162 and −0.242 e, respectively
(from Ch2 to the seleniranium cation, Figure 6a).

Figure 6 (a) CD0 component
for the [PH3Ch2]···[(PhSe)(C2H4)(NH3)]+ and (b) CDtot curve for the [(PH3Ch2)(PhSe)]+···[(C2H4)(NH3)] bond in OSe1_RC, SSe1_RC, and SeSe1_RC. Black dots indicate the z position
or position range of the atomic nuclei. A yellow
vertical band indicates the range of boundary between the fragments.

Indeed, the nature of the chalcogen
atom impacts also on the Se–olefin
bond. In particular, the total curves in Figure 6b seem to be coincident for the three LBs,
but it is important to remember that the olefin is progressively further
away from the selenium, shifting the isoboundary further too (to 0.98,
1.02, and 1.04 Å for Ch2 = O, S, and Se, respectively).
Also, as the CDtot functions are strongly dependent on
the distance in this region, the increase of CTtot is noticeable
(0.319, 0.340, and 0.350 e, respectively).

The linear correlation
between ΔG⧧ and CTtot looks good (r2 =
0.9979), but three data points are not enough to discuss a linear
correlation. Therefore, the phenyl group at selenium was replaced
by a methyl group, yielding three more structures: OSe2, SSe2, and SeSe2, bearing the same LB
(PH3Ch2) and the [MeSe(C2H4)]+ seleniranium cation. The nucleophile is still NH3 and for all structures the RC, TS, and PC geometries have
been optimized (Supporting Information).
In this case, the effect of Ch2 on both ΔG⧧ and CTtot is smaller than
in the case of Se1, but the resulting correlation is
still satisfactory, leading to a r2 =
0.9649 (Figure 7).
Moreover, this correlation makes sense from the physical point of
view, as a large CTtot means that the olefin is heavily
depleted of electron density and will therefore easily be attacked
by a nucleophile.

Figure 7 Linear correlation between ΔG⧧ of the nucleophilic attack and CTtot of
the [(PH3Ch2)(RSe)]+···[(C2H4)(NH3)] bond.

Finally, the same analysis has been conducted on the thiiranium
cation [PhS(C2H4)]+ (S1), again in conjunction with PH3Ch2 as LB and
NH3 as nucleophile. The S···olefin bond
is stronger than the Se···olefin analyzed before, as Eint = −83.2 instead of −75.8 kcal/mol
and Eoi = −299.1 instead of −222.9
kcal/mol (Table 1).
This is reflected also by the larger donation component (CT1 = 0.792 vs 0.733 e) and the larger CTtot (0.438 vs 0.303
e). When the nucleophile and PH3O are present (OS1_RC), the bond components are larger in terms of donation (0.684 instead
of 0.649 e), back-donation (−0.315 instead of −0.400
e), and total transfer, (0.375 instead of 0.247 e). On the basis of Figure 7, one would expect
a lower ΔG⧧ value for OS1_RC than for OSe1_RC. Actually, we find ΔG⧧ = 4.5 kcal/mol, which is higher than
the value for OSe1_RC.

Expanding the analysis to SS1 and SeS1, we have the same trend and ΔG⧧ decreases as CTtot increases
(r2 = 0.939, Supporting Information), but the entire set of data is shifted to higher
values of CTtot. Because the latter is the sum of two contributions,
a
real charge transfer and a polarization contribution,50 likely the latter is systematically different depending
on the nature of the chalcogen atom and introduces such a constant
difference between selenium and sulfur systems. As before, also the
population of the σ*(S–olefin) orbital correlates linearly
with ΔG⧧ (r2 = 0.957), confirming the dual mode of action of the
LBLA: the LB increases the population of the antibonding orbital,
making the nucleophilic attack easier and, at the same time, it depletes
the olefin of electron density, increasing the electrostatic attraction
of the approaching nucleophile.

Conclusions
In
this paper, it has been shown that the NOCV method provides
very detailed descriptions of what happens to the electron density
when an olefin binds to a chalcogeniranium (seleno- or thiiranium)
species and what happens when the resulting adduct interacts with
an LB, decomposing the interaction in terms of chalcogen →
olefin σ donation and chalcogen ← olefin π back-donation.
The description can be made more quantitative by integrating the separated
components by CD analysis, which estimates the amount of charge shifted
from one fragment to the other.

In particular, the evolution
of the electronic fluxes between the
fragments can be followed during the reaction, as the NOCV-CD can
be safely applied also to TSs, products, and even to non-stationary
points at any position of the reaction coordinate. Here, as a model
reaction, the nucleophilic attack of the ammonia on the ethylene moiety
has been considered. As the ammonia approaches, the evolution of the
Se–C chemical bond can be appreciated: σ donation increases
and the π back-donation decreases as the ammonia approaches,
consistent with the change in bonding from a Se–olefin interaction
to a Se–C σ bond, strongly polarized by the cationic
ammonium moiety.

Also, the effect of an LB, such as phosphine
chalcogenides that
have been experimentally used to activate the chalcogen-based LA,
can be investigated by means of the same methodology. The results
presented here show that soft LBs influence both the geometry and
the bond components of the chalcogeniranium cation (which are mutually
dependent). The net result is a decrease in electron density on the
carbon atoms, favoring nucleophilic attack.

From the coupling
of the NOCV-CD analysis with NBO results, it
emerges that the LB increases the population of the Ch–olefin
anti-bonding orbitals, again favoring nucleophilic attack.

In
conclusion, the present “proof of concept” demonstrates
that the NOCV-CD analysis is a powerful tool to investigate chalcogen
chemistry, revealing correlations between experimental and computational
parameters and consequently aiding interpretation of the experimental
results, with as final aim the rational design of improved systems.
Investigations of real systems are in progress and will be reported
in due time.

Theoretical Details
Geometry Optimizations
If not otherwise specified,
all the geometries were optimized with ORCA 4.0.1.2,51,52 using the BP86 functional53 in conjunction
with a triple-ζ quality basis set (def2-TZVP). GGA functional
was shown to be reliable for geometry optimizations,54,55 whereas single-point calculations using the double hybrid B2-PLYP
were used for the computation of improved electronic energies.54 Dispersion corrections were taken into account
using the Grimme D3-parametrized correction to the density functional
theory energy (with Becke–Johnson damping).56 All structures were confirmed to be local energy minima
(no imaginary frequencies) for intermediate species and saddle points
(one imaginary frequency) for TSs.

Energy Decomposition Analysis
EDA41 allows the decomposition of the
bond energy into physically
meaningful contributions. The association energy (Eass), which is the difference of energy between the adduct
and the relaxed fragments, is divided into two terms (eq 1) 1  where Eint is
the interaction energy, the difference of energy between the adduct
and the unrelaxed fragments, and Edef is
the energy needed to distort the fragments form their relaxed geometry
to the geometry they assume in the adduct. The interaction energy Eint can be divided in contributions associated
with the steric (Est), orbital (Eoi) and dispersion (Edisp) interactions, as shown in eq 2 2  Est comprises
the destabilizing interactions between the occupied orbitals and is
responsible for any steric repulsion. Est is generally further decomposed in Pauli and electrostatic contributions,
but using ORCA this passage seems to be not possible at the moment. Eoi is the contribution arising from allowing
the wave function to relax to the fully converged one, accounting
for electron pair bonding, charge transfer, and polarization.

CD Function
Analysis
The CD function analysis is based
on eq 3.36 Δρ′(x,y,z) is the difference between the electron density
of a complex and that of its non-interacting fragments placed in the
same position as they occupy in the complex. In the present case,
the choice of decomposition depends on the interaction being examined.
The function Δq(z) defines,
at each point z along a chosen axis, the amount of
electron charge that, upon formation of the bond between the fragments,
moves across a plane perpendicular to the axis through the point z. A positive (negative) value corresponds to electrons
flowing in the direction of decreasing (increasing) z. Charge accumulates where the slope of Δq is positive and decreases where it is negative. 3  

Because in many case
there is no molecular
symmetry in the systems considered, we make use of the natural orbital
for chemical valence theory (NOCV):38 Δρ′
is built from the occupied orbitals of A and B, suitably orthogonalized
to each other and renormalized (promolecule), using
the “valence operator” (eq 4)57−59 4  where ψi0 is the set of the occupied
Kohn–Sham orbitals of fragments A and B, mutually orthonormalized,
and ψi(AB) is the set of occupied orbitals of the
adduct. The NOCVs can be grouped in pairs of complementary orbitals
(φk, φ–k), corresponding to eigenvalues with the same absolute
value but opposite sign (eq 5). 5  where k numbers the NOCV
pairs (k = 0 for the largest value of |νk|). In this framework, Δρ′
can be defined as in eq 6. 6  

For each value of k, an energy contribution
associated
with the k–the NOCV pair is given (ΔEk). The most important ones
are listed in the Supporting Information

Now, the different Δρk′ can be separately
integrated
using eq 3.37

The NOCV orbital cubes have been manipulated
through the software
“Gabedit”,60 whereas the
electron density matrices have been manipulated through the suite
of tools “Cubes”.61

NBO analysis has been performed using the NBO6 suite of software.62
