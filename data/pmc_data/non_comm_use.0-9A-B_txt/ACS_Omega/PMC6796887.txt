Three-dimensionally printed solid
but highly porous polyamide-12
(PA12) plate-like filters were used as selective adsorbents for capturing
tetrachloroaurate from acidic solutions and leachates to prepare PA12–Au
composite catalysts. The polyamide-adsorbed tetrachloroaurate can
be readily reduced to gold nanoparticles by using sodium borohydride,
ascorbic acid, hydrogen peroxide, UV light, or by heating. All reduction
methods led to polyamide-anchored nanoparticles with an even size
distribution and high dispersion. The particle sizes were somewhat
dependent on the reduction method, but the average diameters were
typically about 20 nm. Particle sizes were determined by using a combination
of single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, helium
ion microscopy, and powder X-ray diffraction. Dispersion of the particles
was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive
spectroscopy. Due to the high adsorption selectivity of polyamide-12
toward tetrachloroaurate, the three-dimensional-printed filters were
first used as selective gold scavengers for the acidic leachate of
electronicwaste (WEEE). The supported nanoparticles were then generated
directly on the filter via a simple reduction step. These objects
were used as catalysts for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol.
The described method provides a direct route from waste to catalysts.
The selective laser sintering method can be used to customize the
flow properties of the catalytically active filter object, which allows
the optimization of the porous catalytic object to meet the requirements
of catalytic processes.

Introduction
Gold nanoparticles
have received an immense amount of attention
during the past decades as they possess a range of fascinating properties
and can be used for a variety of different applications.1−4 Especially gold-nanoparticle-mediated catalysis has emerged as a
promising application.5−8 However, the use of gold nanoparticles as a suspension is problematic
due to challenges faced in handling and recovering the particles.
Therefore, immobilization of nanoparticles onto different polymers,9−11 resins,12,13 and even gels14 has been suggested as a potential solution to this problem. These
solutions often rely on the use of novel or expensive materials that
lack selectivity toward gold and therefore need to be prepared by
using pure gold solutions. The use of a material with high selectivity
toward gold could solve this issue as even gold-containing waste could
be used as a source for gold nanoparticles. Additionally, the previously
reported immobilization methods often lack possibilities to control
the shape, size, and flow properties of the supporting matrix. This,
in turn, sets limitations to their usability in different types of
reactions and flow environments.

Polyamide-12 (PA12) has been
previously reported to have a high
adsorption selectivity toward gold, as tetrachloroaurate, from acidic
waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) leachate.15 The captured tetrachloroaurate can be removed
from polyamide by a simple elution step, which allows PA12 to be used
as a reusable scavenger material. However, it is also possible to
reduce the captured tetrachloroaurate to zero-valent gold directly
on the polymer surface. In other words, the reduction process produces
polyamide-anchored gold nanoparticles.11 The reduced gold particles are firmly attached onto the polyamide
support, which make the metallized materials potential catalysts.
This approach opens up a route for the preparation of supported nanoparticle
catalysts directly from waste materials.

Three-dimensional (3D)
printing enables the alteration of the shape
and size of the nanoparticle-bearing objects. It is also possible
to fabricate flow channels into the printed objects. This has been
previously demonstrated with methods such as stereolithography and
ink-jet printing.16,17 However, these methods produce
surfaces that are not inherently porous. Furthermore, they also often
require specifically customized printing materials. These problems
can be avoided by using powder-based 3D-printing methods, such as
selective laser sintering (SLS). With the SLS technique, it is possible
to produce objects that are inherently porous. In SLS-printing, small
particles with a typical diameter of 50–100 μm are fused
together by a laser, which gives control over the physical characteristics
such as the porosity and mechanical strength of the printed material
by fine-tuning the printing parameters such as laser power, exposure
time, and printing temperature.18−22 When the particles are sintered in such a way that only their surfaces
are partially melted, a solid structure containing accessible voids
between the sintered grains is obtained.15,18,23 Also, a wide range of chemically active
printing materials can be used without complicated preprocessing steps
ranging from functional polymers to mixtures of functional additives
and supporting polymer matrices.23,24

In this
paper, SLS 3D-printed PA12 filters were functionalized
into PA12–Au composites by gold adsorption followed by reduction.
The gold was adsorbed as tetrachloroaurate, from either acidic leachate
of WEEE or a synthetic tetrachloroaurate solution. The reduction and
formation of gold nanoparticles with various sizes were investigated
with helium ion microscopy (HIM), scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive
spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), and single-particle
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICP-MS). A range
of different reduction methods were used to investigate their impact
on the particle size. The autoreduction process with no specific reduction
agent was also followed. The catalytic activity of the supported gold
nanoparticle filters was tested in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol, which is a commonly used model reaction for gold-nanoparticle-mediated
catalysis.25−27

Results and Discussion
The porous
SLS 3D-printed plate-like filters were fabricated using
a Sharebot SnowWhite 3D printer, using PA12 powder consisting of c.a.
50 μm diameter particles as printing material. After the printing process, the filters were
carefully cleaned of any unsintered powder and adsorption of tetrachloroaurate
was performed either from a synthetic solution or from acid-leached
printed circuit board (PCB) waste. After the adsorption, the SLS 3D-printed
filters were washed extensively with water before being used in reduction
experiments. Even though the samples used for the studies were simple
plate-shaped objects, different shapes and forms can also be produced
and functionalized with gold nanoparticles (Figure S1).

The SLS 3D-printed PA12–Au filters were reduced
using a
variety of different reducing agents. First, PA12–Au filters
were treated with 20 mL of 0.5 M NaBH4. By changing the
reduction time between 1 and 15 min, the color of the resulting PA12–Au
filter could be altered. The shorter contact times led to filter plates
with a red to light purple color, whereas longer contact times led
to dark purple filters (Figure 1a). The color changes indicated changes in the nanoparticle
sizes. NaBH4 reduction was also carried out for PA12–Au
filters, where the gold was adsorbed from acid leachate of WEEE (Figure S2, see the Experimental
Section). The resulting metallized filters were identical to
the ones obtained by using pure tetrachloroaurate solution. The results
show that it is possible to use electronic waste as a gold source
for supported nanoparticles.

Figure 1 Images of SLS 3D-printed PA12 filters (10 ×
10 × 2 mm3). (a) Pure filter (PA12) and a filter immediately
after gold
adsorption (PA12–Au). NaBH4: PA12–Au filters
reduced with 0.5 M NaBH4 for 1, 3, 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively.
(b) PA12–Au filters reduced with 0.5 M ascorbic acid for 1,
3, 5, 10, and 15 min, respectively. (c) PA12–Au filters reduced
with 30% H2O2 for 5, 10, 15, 30, and 60 min,
respectively. (d) PA12–Au filters reduced by using UV light
(405 nm) for 20, 40, and 60 min. (e) PA12–Au filters reduced
by heating them in the oven (110 °C) for 30, 60, and 90 min.

The second tested reduction method, that is, reduction
with ascorbic
acid, yielded gray to greenish PA12–Au filters. Also, in this
case, the intensity of the color was dependent on the reduction time
(Figure 1b). However,
after the reduction, the color of the filters started to change to
purple over a longer period of storage, typically over several days.
The next method of reduction was more unconventional as it included
treating the PA12–Au filter with hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
peroxide is known to produce gold nanoparticles28 and in the case of SLS 3D-printed PA12–Au filters,
it resulted in filters with red to light brown colors (Figure 1c). The last two methods tested
were treating the filters with UV light (405 nm) and heating them
in the oven at 110 °C, respectively. Both methods yielded PA12–Au
filters with a red to purple color. In general, the heating treatment
produced a much more intense color than the light-induced reduction
(Figure 1d,e). However,
it should be noted that even storing the PA12–Au filters at
room temperature in ambient light was enough for slow conversion of
the adsorbed gold into nanoparticles. This was observed as the color
of the filters slowly turned light purple over an extended period
of time.

HIM imaging of the PA12–Au samples was conducted
to study
the nanoparticle sizes and their distribution within the SLS 3D-printed
filters. Figure 2 shows
the HIM images of PA12–Au filters prepared from synthetic tetrachloroaurate
solution and reduced with H2O2 (Figure 2a,b) and ascorbic acid-reduced
PA12–Au filters prepared from acidic WEEE leachate (Figure 2c,d). From the zoomed-out
images, it can be seen that distributions of the gold nanoparticles
on the surfaces of the fused PA12 particles in PA12–Au filters
are rather even for both of the samples. As it has been previously
shown, SLS 3D-printing can be used to fabricate solid but highly porous
structures, where a fluid can flow through the voids between the partially
fused particles.23,24 This particle-like structure
can also be seen in Figure 2a,c and in Figure S3 given as a
Supporting Information. Furthermore, the gold nanoparticles are attached
only on the surfaces of the fused particles and they are not capsulated
by the polymer. This means that the gold nanoparticles are also distributed
in the inner structure of the printed objects, but they are still
able to interact with fluids running through the object material.
The more detailed HIM images (Figure 2b,d) confirm the even spatial distribution of the gold
particles. The even size distribution of the nanoparticles can also
be seen in Figures 2b,d. Even if HIM is not the optimal method for particle size analysis,
it clearly indicates that most of the nanoparticles are within the
range of 10–100 nm in both samples. The HIM images of the samples
reduced by other methods are given in the Supporting Information (Figures S4 and S5).

Figure 2 HIM images of the surfaces
of the H2O2-reduced
PA12–Au filters prepared using synthetic tetrachloroaurate
solution (a, b) and of the ascorbic acid-reduced, WEEE-derived PA12–Au
filters (c, d).

The even distribution of the gold
nanoparticles on the surfaces
of the SLS 3D-printed objects is somewhat surprising since the nanoparticles
are not end-capped with ligands. However, it could be reasoned that
interactions between gold and the functional groups of the PA12 polymer
are responsible for the high dispersion and even size distribution.
This has also been suggested as the reason for the even distribution
of gold nanoparticles on PA66 surfaces.11 Most likely, the amide groups of PA12 provide sufficiently strong
interactions with the nanoparticles to prevent excessive agglomeration.

Additional analyses for the dispersion of the gold nanoparticles
on the printed filters were carried out by performing spectral imaging
using SEM-EDS. The ascorbic acid-reduced PA12–Au filter was
covered with silver particles prior to SEM-EDS analysis. Spectral
imaging was then performed, and the results are shown in Figure 3. The image of the
analyzed area of the sample (Figure 3a) is overlaid with the spectral imaging map received
for the gold (Figure 3b). Together with the HIM imaging results, the SEM-EDS analysis confirms
that the distribution of the gold nanoparticles on the PA12–Au
filters is uniform.

PA12–Au sample (a). Overlaid image of the obtained gold spectral
image (green) and the initial image of the analyzed area (b).

Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the
PA12–Au filters
are shown in Figure 4. All of the XRD patterns show characteristic peaks of the PA12 polymer
matrix, which can be confirmed based on the peaks observed in the
pattern of the reference filter of pristine PA12 (reference pattern
for PA12 was not available in the PDF4 database29). In case of filters with reduced gold nanoparticles, the
characteristic diffraction peaks at 38.1, 44.39, 64.62, and 77.59°
2θ could be assigned (PDF4 entry: 00-066-0091)2 to metallic gold in a face-centered cubic crystal system
(Fm3̅m). In addition to the
characteristic peaks of PA12 and gold, there were no other peaks in
the patterns, indicating that only gold was reduced onto the filters.
This was also the case with the NaBH4-reduced sample where
WEEE was used as the gold source. It means that the other metals present
in the WEEE solution (e.g., Cu, Fe, Al...) were not adsorbed to the
PA12 filters. However, it should be noted that the gold content in
that particular sample was also considerably lower, due to a much
lower concentration of gold being available for adsorption from the
acid-leached WEEE compared to the synthetic tetrachloroaurate solution.
Comparison of the XRDs of the different reduction techniques revealed
that the H2O2 reduction showed the highest intensity
for gold particles, followed by others in the order of ascorbic acid
> heat treatment ≥ NaBH4 > UV light (Figure 4).

PA12–Au filters with different reducing
agents used: (a) reference filter without Au; PA12–Au reduced

acid, and (f) H2O2; and (g) PA12–Au sample,

To get a coarse estimate of the
dispersion of gold in the filter,
the average crystallite size of the gold particles was estimated by
the Scherrer method as shown in eq 1 1  in which D is the average
crystallite size, K is the shape-dependent Scherrer
constant (0.90 for spherical crystallites with a cubic symmetry),
λ is the X-ray wavelength (1.5406 Å), βs is the full peak-width at half-maximum intensity (given in radians)
corresponding to structural broadening (instrumental broadening taken
into account), and θ is the diffraction angle. For each sample,
the strongest Au peak (38.1° 2θ) with Miller indices (111)
was taken for an indicative crystal size analysis, and the resulting
values are shown in the Supporting Information (Table S1). Generally, the average crystal size of gold particles
ranged from 30 to 70 nm. It is noticeable that UV light-treated and
H2O2-treated samples exhibit similar-sized particles,
even though in terms of quantity they represent the two extremes of
the series. In all the rest of the samples, the crystal size of gold
is about the same (∼30 nm) regardless of the quantity of the
gold phase per sample. However, it should be kept in mind that these
results represent a rather qualitative estimation of the particle
size as an accurate peak profile analysis of a low crystalline phase
that is mixed with a low-crystalline organic matrix is challenging
for reasons such as the degree of peak overlap and uncertainties to
define the proper peak profile tailing versus baseline signals. Second,
the crystallographic crystal size analysis tends to skew on larger
average sizes due the fact that larger particles have a somewhat higher
diffraction power than the smaller ones. However, the XRD results
are well in line with the HIM analyses above.

The SP-ICP-MS
analyses were used to study further the size distribution
of the nanoparticles. SP-ICP-MS is a highly sensitive method for the
characterization of nanoparticles from solutions. Even if the leaching
of gold from the gold-functionalized filters was low, the removed
particles could be analyzed. The nanoparticle size distribution diagram
observed during the analysis is represented in Figure 5. The majority of the observed particles
were in the size range of 14–32 nm (≥90% detected particles).
Typically, most of the nanoparticles observed appeared to have an
average diameter of around 20 nm. Among the different reduction methods,
NaBH4 seems to lead to the smallest nanoparticles with
average sizes of 16 ± 1 nm observed, while ascorbic acid, heating,
and UV light led to average particle sizes of 20 ± 5, 20 ±
4, and 20 ± 3 nm, respectively. Reduction with H2O2 led to particles with an average diameter of 21 ± 2
nm. The PA12–Au filters where the [AuCl4]− was adsorbed from the acidic WEEE leachate followed by reduction
using NaBH4 produced nanoparticles of 21 ± 4 nm diameter
(Table S2).

Figure 5 Nanoparticle size distribution
diagram of the PA12–Au filters
reduced with different methods obtained from the SP-ICP-MS measurement.
The observed particle frequencies are not strictly comparable to each
other due to different dilution factors and run times.

As can be seen from the average diameters observed, most
of the
reduction methods led to PA12–Au filters having rather uniformly
sized nanoparticles. In addition, the normal analytical uncertainty
might explain the observed differences in the average diameters. Even
the WEEE-derived PA12–Au filters possessed nanoparticles of
around the same size than the other PA12–Au filters produced
by using synthetic tetrachloroaurate solutions. Such results confirm
the suitability of secondary gold sources for generating supported
nanoparticles. The particle size distribution based on SP-ICP-MS results
are in good agreement with the sizes of the nanoparticles observed
in the HIM images (Figures 2, S4, and S5) and the results obtained
by XRD (Figure 4 and Table S1). It should be emphasized that no severe
leaching of gold was observed. This was tested by shaking the catalyst
object vigorously in ultrapure water and analyzing the released Au-NPs
by SP-ICP-MS. The amount of released Au was found to be at most 0.1
wt %. The results of the leaching tests support further the firm attachment
of gold nanoparticles on the PA12 matrix.

The catalytic activity
of the gold nanoparticle-functionalized
SLS 3D-printed filters was tested in the simple reduction of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4 following the
previously reported method.25 The completeness
of the reactions were then determined by UV–vis spectroscopy.
Based on the obtained results (Figure 6), it is evident that the PA12–Au filters are
able to effectively catalyze the conversion. The solutions without
Au catalysts show no signs of a reaction, whereas most PA12–Au
filters have catalyzed the reactions to completeness within the 2
h reaction time. The filter treated by heating shows slightly deviating
results compared to others. However, all of the reactions with the
catalysts were found to reach completeness if let to react over a
longer period of time. In addition to the simple plate-shaped PA12–Au
filters, stir bar sleeve-shaped catalysts (Figure S1) were also tested and found to perform similar to the other
filters tested.

Figure 6 UV–vis results for the gold-catalyzed reduction
of 4-nitrophenol
to 4-aminophenol in the presence of NaBH4.

The reusability of the catalysts was tested by performing
10 consecutive
catalytic cycles with the PA12–Au filter reduced with NaBH4. No significant decrease in the catalytic activity was observed,
which further shows the strong attachment of the gold nanoparticles
onto the SLS 3D-printed PA12 filter. Additionally, the PA12–Au
filter where gold was adsorbed from acid-leached WEEE, followed by
reduction with NaBH4, was also tested (WEEE-NaBH4). The filter performed just like the ones prepared using pure tetrachloroaurate
solution, further confirming that waste materials such as WEEE can
be used as a feedstock for the preparation of gold nanoparticle catalysts.

Conclusions
In this paper, we introduce a method for manufacturing SLS 3D-printed
polyamide-12 objects functionalized with gold nanoparticles. This
can be achieved by adsorbing gold as tetrachloroaurate onto the polyamide-12
matrix, followed by a reduction. A variety of reduction methods can
be used to produce highly dispersed and evenly sized gold nanoparticles
with an average diameter of around 20 nm on the polyamide filters.
The functionalized filters can be used as effective catalysts in the
reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. Since PA12 is a highly
selective adsorbent for gold, it is possible to use various gold-containing
solutions as the source of gold. This opens up a direct route from
waste materials to catalysts. For example, the acidic leachate of
circuit board waste can be used as the gold source for the preparation
of PA12-supported gold nanoparticle catalysts with no additional purification
steps and without any interference by the other metals. SLS-printing
provides an attempting technique for preparing heterogeneous catalysts.
The chemical activity can be optimized by the choice of the printing
material, while the printing technique allows fine-tuning of the shape,
size, porosity, and flow properties of the printed object. Although
we have used SLS-printing for the preparation of catalysts with supported
gold nanoparticles, the same approach can be extended to other metals
as well. This can be achieved by replacing PA12 with another printing
material that can selectively adsorb the desired metal.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Materials
Hydrogen peroxide (AnalaR NORMAPUR)
and ascorbic acid (AnalaR NORMAPUR) were purchased from VWR. Sodium
borohydride (>98%) was supplied by Acros Organics, and 4-nitrophenol
(98%), nitric acid (≥65%), and hydrochloric acid (≥37%)
were purchased from Merck. Polyamide-12 was obtained from ADVANC3D
materials and used without any additional pretreatment. All chemicals
were used as received.

3D-Printing of the PA12 Filters
The PA12 filters (10
× 10 × 2 mm3) were printed using a Sharebot SnowWhite
SLS 3D printer. Highly porous objects with good physical durability
were obtained using the following parameters during the printing process:
161 °C environmental temperature, 40% laser power (a maximum
of 14 W), 2400 mm s–1 laser speed, and 0.1 mm layer
height. The 3D-printed objects were thoroughly cleaned of any nonsintered
powder after the printing process. No further pretreatment was performed
prior to the gold adsorption experiments.

Adsorption of Tetrachloroaurate
onto PA12 Filters
The
gold was adsorbed as tetrachloroaurate onto the SLS 3D-printed filters
either from a synthetic solution or from acid-leached PCB waste. The
synthetic tetrachloroaurate solution was prepared by diluting a Perkin
Elmer 1000 mg L–1 spectroscopy standard until the
concentration of gold was around 200 mg L–1. The
solution was adjusted to have 10 vol % HCl. The PCB sample was prepared
by ashing the milled PCB waste at 950 °C for 4 h. The sample
was then dissolved using ultrasound-assisted leaching with aqua regia.
The leachate was diluted before the gold was adsorbed onto the 3D-printed
filters. Both with synthetic and authentic solutions, the filter plates
were kept in contact with the solution for 8 h. This was done to ensure
the saturation, even though the adsorption process itself is rather
fast.15 After the adsorption, the filters
were thoroughly washed with water. The PA12–Au objects, prepared
from the synthetic tetrachloroaurate solution, were adjusted to possess
around 0.5 wt % of gold. After the adsorption, the objects were reduced.
The samples that were analyzed using the following methods were reduced
using 0.5 M NaBH4, 0.5 M ascorbic acid, 30% H2O2 solution, UV light, or thermal treatment for 15 min
(NaBH4 and ascorbic acid), 60 min (H2O2 and UV), or 90 min (thermal treatment).

Helium Ion Microscopy
Imaging was performed with a
Carl Zeiss ORION NanoFab helium ion microscope. The beam energy used
was roughly 30 keV, and the beam current was set between 0.32 and
0.38 pA. The dwell time of the scans was altered between 0.2 and 50
μs for optimal picture quality. The working distance was generally
around 6.2–8.3 mm. Samples were not treated in any way before
imaging aside from the use of pressurized air to clear any loose particles
from the surfaces of the samples.

Scanning Electron Microscopy
Energy-Dispersive X-Ray Spectroscopy
The SEM-EDS analysis
was performed by using Hitachi S-4800 field
emission scanning electron microscopy with a Thermo Electron Noran
System Sic EDS (NSS200) detector. The samples were coated with silver
particles prior to analysis to overcome the challenges faced with
nonconductive samples. An acceleration voltage of 10 kV was used for
the analysis. Around 10 min of spectral imaging data were gathered
during the imaging process for the gold dispersion analysis.

Powder
X-ray Diffractometry
X-ray powder diffraction
patterns were measured by a PANalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer
in Bragg–Brentano geometry using Cu Kα1 radiation
(Johannsson type monochromator, λ = 1.5406 Å, 45 kV, 40
mA). A sample filter was first set on a silicon filter (zero background
signal filter) that was placed on a steel-made sample holder with
a height-adjustable cavity. The pattern was recorded from a spinning
sample by an X’Celerator detector in the 2θ range of
3–80° with a step size of 0.017° and a counting time
of 400 s per step (4 h 10 min overall time). Diffraction data were
processed with the Malvern Panalytical HighScore Plus v. 4.7 program.30

Single-Particle Inductively Coupled Plasma
Mass Spectrometry
SP-ICP-MS measurements were performed on
a NexION350D ICP-MS spectrometer
operating in the single-particle mode using the Syngistix Nano Application
Module (PerkinElmer Inc., Massachusetts). Instrumental parameters
are shown in Table 1. The nebulizer gas flow was optimized to gain maximum response for 197Au. The sample uptake rate was measured daily by quantifying
the mass of sample uptake after 3 min in duplicate. The transport
efficiency (i.e., the fraction of nebulized sample entering the plasma)
was determined using the particle size method. Citrate-stabilized
30 and 60 nm gold nanoparticles (NanoComposix, San Diego, CA) were
used for particle calibration after dilution with ultrapure water
with a resistivity of 18.2 MΩ cm (UP-water, PURELAB Ultra, ELGA
LabWater, Buckinghamshire, U.K.). Dissolved gold calibration solutions
were prepared from a standard stock solution of 100 μg mL–1 Au in 2% HCl (Pure Plus, Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts)
by dilution in a thiourea solution (0.1 mol % thiourea (≥99.0%,
VWR International, Pennsylvania), 2.4 vol % HCl, and 0.05 vol % HNO3). High-purity (Analpure) hydrochloric acid and nitric acid
were obtained from Analytika spol. s r.o. (Prague, Chech Republic).
All dilutions were performed gravimetrically.

All samples
were placed in 50 mL polypropene containers and 20
mL of UP-water was added. The samples were vigorously shaken for 30
s for particle release. For every sample, at least three different
dilutions were made with UP-water to minimize the contribution of
dissolved signal possibly overlapping the particle signal. The sampling
time was adjusted to 60–6000 s depending on the sample to gain
a sufficient number of detected peaks for reliable particle concentration
calculation (>500 peaks). All dilutions were performed gravimetrically,
and samples were analyzed as soon as possible after the initial sample
preparation to minimize changes in the original sample composition
over time.

The Syngistix Nano Application Module was used for
data processing.
The intensity of detected particles was related to the particle mass
(μg) using a particle calibration curve and transformed to the
particle diameter (nm) assuming a spherical particle geometry. The
mean particle diameter and particle concentration for each sample
were calculated as an average for the results obtained for different
dilutions (n = 1–3) and replicate readings
and were reported as average ± standard deviation (1 s). The
instrumental drift causing the level of measured intensity to decrease
over time was corrected with a drift correction standard (Pt 1 μg
kg–1 in 1 + 1% HCl/HNO3). The total mass
of particulate gold in the samples was calculated based on the measured
sample particle concentration (particles/g) and mean particle diameter
(nm).

UV–Vis Spectroscopy
UV–vis spectra of
the catalytically reduced 4-nitrophenol solutions were measured from
700 to 340 nm using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 25 UV/Vis-spectrophotometer.
A slit of 1.0 nm was used with a scan speed of 240 nm min–1 and a data interval of 3.0 nm. Ultrapure water was used as a reference
sample in the reference cuvette.

Catalysis
A 0.1
mM solution of 4-nitrophenol was prepared
by dissolving roughly 7 mg of 4-nitrophenol in 500 mL of deionized
water. Next, 5 mL of the obtained solution was pipetted to eight small
glass beakers, and 10 mg of NaBH4 was added to each beaker
to act as the reducing agent. Excess of NaBH4 was used
to avoid any kind of effect the change of concentration of the reductant
could have on the reaction. One PA12–Au filter each treated
with a different gold reduction method (as described earlier) was
placed in the beaker containing 4-nitrophenol and NaBH4. Two beakers, one containing just the starting material and the
reductant and the other also containing the PA12 filter with no gold,
acted as references. The mixtures were then stirred for 2 h, even
though many of the reactions could be seen to happen much faster.
Excessive reaction time was chosen to further confirm that the reaction
would not proceed without the catalyst. The reusability of the catalysts
was determined by performing 10 reaction cycles with a PA12–Au
filter that had been reduced using NaBH4. No significant
drop in the catalytic activity was observed. Samples were then analyzed
by using UV–vis spectroscopy.
