The stability of perovskite solar cells (PSC) is often
compromised
by the organic hole transport materials (HTMs). We report here the
effect of WO3 as an inorganic HTM for carbon electrodes
for improved stability in PSCs, which are made under ambient conditions.
Sequential fabrication of the PSC was performed under ambient conditions
with mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/CH3NH3PbI3 layers, and, on the top of these
layers, the WO3 nanoparticle-embedded carbon electrode
was used. Different concentrations of WO3 nanoparticles
as HTM incorporated in carbon counter electrodes were tested, which
varied the stability of the cell under ambient conditions. The addition
of 7.5% WO3 (by volume) led to a maximum power conversion
efficiency of 10.5%, whereas the stability of the cells under ambient
condition was ∼350 h, maintaining ∼80% of the initial
efficiency under light illumination. At the same time, the higher
WO3 concentration exhibited an efficiency of 9.5%, which
was stable up to ∼500 h with a loss of only ∼15% of
the initial efficiency under normal atmospheric conditions and light
illumination. This work demonstrates an effective way to improve the
stability of carbon-based perovskite solar cells without affecting
the efficiency for future applications.

Introduction
Technology development with improved levels
of sustainability can
create opportunity for today’s state of the art photovoltaic
devices as well as develop existing materials to improve performance.
Organic–inorganic hybrid solar cells with perovskite-type pigments
have been much studied in recent years. The solar cells incorporating
a CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3)
compound with a perovskite structure have shown high photoconversion
efficiencies (PCEs). Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently become
one of such technology and an area of interest owing to their lower
preparation cost and high-conversion efficiency in the field of solar
cell research.1−3 The investigation in the field of PSCs has increased
in recent years, and a highest recorded efficiency of 25.2% was achieved
in early 2019, which has been independently confirmed by the international
authority and authenticating institution, National Renewable Energy
Laboratory (NREL).4,5 Large-area PSCs with an active
area >1 cm2 exhibited a maximum photoconversion efficiency
(PCE) of 20.5% and a certified PCE of 19.6%.6 Since the maximum theoretical PCE of the PSCs employing MAPbI3 is around 31%, there is still great scope for development.7 In addition to the high PCE achieved with the
halide perovskites, these materials are composed of only earth-abundant
elements and can be prepared by various low-cost methods. It is, therefore,
highly anticipated that implantation of PSCs could be deployed on
an industrial scale. The perovskite materials now focus on some challenging
issues, for instance, the high PCE solar cells are still based on
toxic Pb contamination and the halide salts tend to dissociate in
the presence of moisture, which causes stability issue for long-term
usage.8 As per the toxicity concern of
using Pb, extensive research effort has been committed to the development
of lead-free perovskites such as CH3NH3SnI3, CH(NH2)2SnI3, CsSnI3, Cs2SnI6, BaZrS3, CaZrSe3, CaHfSe3, etc. for photovoltaic applications.9,10 It has been observed that the oxide perovskites exhibit more water
resistivity compared to the halide perovskite. Besides, it is facile
to tune the band gap of the oxide perovskite to match the solar spectrum
and, therefore, act as a photoanode candidate for dye-sensitized solar
cells (DSSCs). Extensive research on DSSCs enlarged the development
pathway of planar structured PSCs in the initial stages.11−13 The planar structure of PSCs became more prevalent when both the
electron and hole transport properties have been simultaneously observed
for the perovskite material.14−16 Highly efficient PSCs sometimes
rapidly lose their efficiency due to the hygroscopic character of the materials used.17 Therefore, selection of materials and their
fabrication process has limited the performance of PSCs. To overcome
these issues, the mesoporous PSCs (m-PSCs) have come into account
due to their simple fabrication process, high energy conversion, and
enhanced resistivity toward environmental factors.18,19 The mesoporous PSC includes carbon-based back contact, a suitable
solution to substitute noble metals, due to its low cost, high conductivity,
and eventually low-temperature processing and work function close
to that of gold.20 However, it would be
advantageous to do so to increase the flexibility and the overall
transparency of the device.

To develop high-efficiency and stable
devices as well as environmentally
benign perovskites is critical, yet challenging aspects remain in
PSC research. Moisture sensitivity of the organic constituents of
the PSC device resulting in long-term stability issue for its commercialization.17,21 However, further involvements are required to enhance the commercial
viability of PSC, which may be achieved through careful manipulation
of the nanoscale structure and the implementation of novel processing
techniques. To address the stability challenges, Al2O3 layer deposition, Li-doping, and Cs-doping inclusion to perovskite
layer have been introduced for their long-term implementation.22,23 Previously, Grätzel et al. reported that employment of solid-state
organic hole transport materials (HTM) boosted the reported efficiency
of solid-state m-PSCs to 9.7%.11 Similarly,
Nazeeruddin et al. introduced a sandwich-type layer of mesoporous
TiO2 and MAPbI3 as a light harvester with polymeric
HTMs, which resulted in an efficiency of 12%.24 Seok’s group used CH3NH3Pbl3–xBrx-based mixed halide
perovskites to further improve the efficiency to ∼12.3% and
also to achieve better stability.25 On
the other hand, Lee et al. reported a PSC composed of mesoporous Al2O3 instead of TiO2, demonstrating that
Al2O3 merely acted as a scaffold layer without
injection of photoexcited electrons resulting in faster electron diffusion
through the perovskite layer.26 Gracini
et al. reported 1 year stable PSCs using a two-dimensional/three-dimensional
(2D/3D) combined perovskite layer.27 To
get high efficiency and stability, effort to modify the mesoporous
layer has been also made for a PSC device. Similarly, CuInS2 quantum dot-modified TiO2 nanoarrays were introduced
by Gao et al. for better stability of devices.28 Zhang et al. reported SnO2-based devices with
17.83% efficiency.29 However, to develop
high-efficiency and stable devices as well as environmentally supported
perovskites is still a crucial challenge and offers new and promising
opportunities.30−32

Due to the ease of fabrication and higher efficiency,
solar cells
are often chosen as sources of electrical energy harvester, emerging
markets such as self-powering systems and portable/wearable electronics.33 Recently, Huan et al. reported an inexpensive
photovoltaic-electrochemical cell system containing a low-cost perovskite
photovoltaic minimodule, exhibiting ∼2.3% solar-to-hydrocarbon
efficiency.34 Intensive work is continuing
for commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic technology as well.35−37

In these ways, several attempts have been made to enhance
the performance
of PSCs. In spite of encouraging performance, the drawbacks of organic
HTM allow the development of inorganic HTM-based PSCs using Co3O4,38 CuSCN,39 NiO,40,41 CuS,42 and others.43 Devices based
on inorganic HTMs demonstrated better stability compared to a spiro-OMeTAD-based
PSC in ambient condition.44,45 Overall, to address
the shortcomings associated with regular PSCs, carbon-based mesoscopic
PSCs with inorganic HTM have attracted serious attention. Very recently,
our group reported efficient PSC with WO3 nanoparticle
as HTM.46 Established electrochromic property
of WO3 has been commercially inspected in electrochromic
applications such as “smart windows”.47,48 It can lead to an integrated photoelectrochromic device, instead
of sequential conjoining of a solar cell followed by a full electrochromic
device. Using WO3-based perovskite solar cells opens the
possibility of further development in building-integrated photovoltaic
(BIPV) application in terms of their low-energy, cost-effective, and
novel architecture-based futuristic use.49

Here, we report the performance of MAPbI3-based
PSCs
with a mesoporous TiO2/Al2O3/carbon
architecture where WO3 nanoparticle-based carbon back contact
was employed. The method is based on a fully wet deposition process,
which takes less time and utilizes a screen-printing method. The influence
of the different amounts of WO3 is observed using 5, 7.5,
and 10% WO3 (by volume) in the carbon paste and compared
with a device without WO3 used as a reference, respectively.
The purpose of this experiment was to develop stable PSC devices without
using glovebox conditions and without any encapsulation. In our earlier
reported paper, stability of the unsealed devices was very poor, ∼23%
decay of initial PCE values within 100 h. The PSC fabrication technique
was adopted from our earlier report with a modification of different
WO3 concentrations consisting of carbon layer deposition
for back contact.46 A schematic description
of the PSC fabrication processes is given (steps a–g) in Figure 1.

Figure 1 Stepwise fabrication
process of the mesoporous perovskite solar
cell. Step a: Etching of fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass; step
b: compact TiO2 layer deposition; step c: mesoporous TiO2 layer formation; step d: lithium doping using lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)
imide (Li-TFSI); step e: spin coating of mesoporous Al2O3 layer; step f: screen printing of the carbon electrode;
step g: perovskite layer formation.

Results and Discussion
The stepwise fabrication process
with schematic structures is shown
in Figure 1. Step a
resembles etching of a FTO glass substrate. Step b and step c reflect
the deposition of a compact TiO2 layer and mesoporous TiO2 layers, respectively. Lithium doping and mesoporous Al2O3 layer addition are shown in step d and step
e, respectively. Screen printing of the WO3 nanoparticles
incorporated the carbon layer is represented by step f. Finally, the
drop casting and spin coating of the perovskite were carried out,
as shown in step g. The homogenous mixture for different carbon pastes
was prepared by using the ball-milling technique. The cross-sectional
FESEM image (Figure 2a) of the device shows the appropriate orientation of the layers
in the following sequence FTO/c-TiO2/ m-TiO2/m-Al2O3/carbon from bottom to top. The average
thicknesses of mesoporous TiO2 and mesoporous Al2O3 layers are ∼700 and ∼500 nm, respectively.

(FESEM) image of the TiO2/Al2O3/carbon
device with MAPbI3 and (b) energy dispersive X-ray (EDX)
elemental color mapping of Ti, O, Al, Pb, I, and C of the device.

Corresponding energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping
confirms the
distribution of elements and successful deposition of different layers,
as shown in Figure 2b. The distribution of lead and iodine also confirms that the perovskite
(MAPbI3) layer had spread through the carbon layer as well
as the mesoporous layers. To confirm the existence of WO3, the EDX characterization was carried out and the EDX spectrum is
given in Figure S1, supplementary information
(ESI).

The XRD pattern of synthesized CH3NH3PbI3 thin films on the FTO glass substrate is shown in Figure 3. Except for the
signals of FTO glass and anatase TiO2 shown with black
and green dots, respectively, all remaining signals are responsible
for the MAPbI3 perovskite. The typical peaks at 14.10,
23.47, 28.42, and 30.89° correspond to the (110), (211), (220),
and (213) planes of the tetragonal phase of MAPbI3. XRD
study confirms the phase purity and crystalline features of MAPbI3, as reported previously.50,51

for (110), (211), (220), and (213) planes are given in comparison
to the blank FTO (in black).

To evaluate the performance of the prepared m-PSCs
made in ambient
condition, the current vs voltage (J–V) characteristic measurement was performed under simulated
AM 1.5 (100 mW/cm2). Figure 4a and Table 1 exhibit the photovoltaic parameters such
as efficiency, short-circuit current density (JSC), open-circuit voltage (VOC),
and fill factor (FF) of the cells with an active area of 0.16 cm2. Photovoltaic performance of the devices was examined, and
the maximum photoconversion efficiency (PCE) was found ∼10.5%
having JSC, VOC, and FF of 21.2 mA/cm2, 854.4 mV, and 0.58, respectively,
for the device with 7.5% WO3, whereas the highest achieved
efficiencies for 5 and 10% WO3 devices were ∼8.3
and ∼9.4%, respectively. The high JSC values may have occurred due to the Al2O3 layer
deposition, which acts as a spacer layer that retards the recombination
between TiO2 and the carbon electrode.

(J–V) curves
and (b) incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE) spectra for different
m-PSCs containing 5, 7.5, 10% of WO3 compared with and

IPCE resembles the external quantum efficiency of
the DSSC device,
which includes the effects of optical losses caused by transmission
and reflection. The IPCE curve for m-PSCs exhibited a broad peak over
the range of 300–800 nm with a maximum value of ∼89%
for the 7.5% WO3-based device at a wavelength of 550 nm
indicating high charge collection efficiency in cells, as shown in Figure 4b. Due to a narrow
band gap of ∼1.55 eV, the MAPbI3 provides high extinction
coefficient resulting in broad IPCE spectra from the visible range
to a part of the near-infrared. Further, calculation of the integrated
photocurrent density was evaluated from the overlap integral of the
IPCE spectra as recorded in Figure 4b with the AM 1.5 solar emission for different devices
and values mentioned in Table S1 (ESI).
The average integrated photocurrent densities of PSCs with different
amounts of WO3 additive closely match with photocurrent
densities obtained from the J–V curve.

The nature of forward and reverse scanned J–V plots gives impression of hysteresis. Significant hysteresis is
observed for all of the different sets of devices, as shown in Figure 5a–c. Hysteresis
is more pronounced for the devices with 7.5% WO3, as can
be seen from Figure 5b. Figure 5d provides
the power output of all of the PSC devices per unit cross-sectional
area. The enhanced power density was observed for WO3-added
devices compared to the device without WO3 treatment. Similar
to the J–V plot, the power density reaches
its maximum values of 5.89 mW/cm2 for 7.5% WO3.

and reverse scans with an active area of 0.16 cm2 under
1 sun (100 mW/cm2) light illumination for devices with
(a) 10%, (b) 7.5%, and (c) 5% WO3 and (d) corresponding
power density vs voltage plot.

Figure S2 (ESI) provides
the variance
of VOC, JSC, fill factor, and PCE values for a batch of 10 devices from each
set. The overall PCE values range from 10.1 to 10.5% in the case of
the 7.5% of the WO3-added devices. Interestingly, the fill
factor of devices with a lower amount of WO3 is higher
than that of the others.

Further, the electrochemical impedance
spectroscopy (EIS) measurements
were carried out to understand the transport properties at different
interfaces in the m-PSC assembly. The EIS spectra (Nyquist plot) with
equivalent circuit diagram and corresponding Bode phase diagram of
the concerned PSCs were recorded under dark at 0.7 V bias from
10 to 1 MHz, as shown in Figure 6a,b, respectively. In the circuit diagram (inset of Figure 6a), RS represents the series resistance, which include resistance
of FTO and carbon counter electrode. Rrec is the charge-transfer resistance at the perovskite/carbon interface
and RCT is the charge-transfer resistance
at the TiO2/MAPbI3 interface. It can be interpreted
from Figure 6a that
the large parabola in the high-frequency region indicates higher transportation
and exchange resistance from the perovskite to the carbon counter
electrode, so it will affect the fill factor as reflected from J–V characterization. On the other hand, the smaller
parabola reflects the recombination resistance between TiO2 and the perovskite interface. The large RCT value implies a slow charge recombination process or low charge
recombination rate. This low recombination rate is responsible for
high values of JSC and VOC, which is reflected in the J–V curve. Devices with higher RS value
should have lower efficiency, which can be observed from Table S2 (ESI). Long-term stability is the most
critical challenge for PSCs under ambient conditions without any encapsulation.
The stability of the PSC is environment dependent, mostly affected
by the humidity, light conditions, and climatic conditions.52

Figure 6 (a) EIS characteristics (Nyquist plots) with the fitted
circuit
diagram and (b) corresponding Bode phase plot of different PSCs.

The PSCs were kept at ambient conditions, to understand
the degradation
pattern of the solar cell. The prepared PSCs were characterized under
illumination for ∼500 h, as shown in Figure 7a–c. It was observed that the amount
of WO3 controls the stability of the devices. Figure 7a,b indicates a steady
decrease in JSC and VOC with time, respectively. The devices with a higher
amount of WO3 maintain their efficiency for a longer time.
The device containing 7.5% of WO3 maintained its stability
with a loss of 20% efficiency up to ∼350 h. Significantly,
stability of ∼500 h is observed for the device with 10% of
WO3 and it maintains the PCE of ∼85% of the initial
value (Figure 7c).
The presence of inorganic HTM may stabilize the device in these purposes.
This result indicates that higher concentration of WO3 affects
the power conversion efficiency, but at the same time it increases
the stability of the devices. The use of WO3/carbon electrode
reduces the porosity of the layer due to the presence of small sized
WO3 nanoparticles. The small porosity of the electrode
layer could help to prevent the permeability of moisture/oxygen through
the counter electrode. This may be the reason behind the greater stability
of devices with a higher amount of WO3 nanoparticle in
the electrode material. A simple schematic energy band diagram of
the carbon-based mesoscopic PSCs with WO3 nanoparticles
additive is shown in Figure 7d. According to the energy-level positions of different components,
the excited electron is transferred from the conduction band of the
MAPbI3, perovskite layer (−3.9 eV) to that of the
TiO2 layer (−4.0 eV) followed by the hole extraction
from the perovskite layer (−5.4 eV) to the carbon layer (−5.0
eV) via WO3 (−5.3 eV). Al2O3 layer served as a spacer and retards the electron–hole recombination
in the PSCs. The additive WO3 inside the carbon film can
work as HTM to promote the hole-extraction in the perovskite/carbon
interface due to its appropriate position of the conduction band.46,53,54 This is further facilitated by
energy-level matching, which helps a notable improvement in the hole
extraction, recombination resistance compared to without WO3-based device.

schematic diagram of energy band position of the WO3-added
perovskite solar cell.

It is proposed that incorporating WO3 in Pt CE favorably
occupies the gap states near the Fermi level and maintains high work
function, which accelerates the charge transportation and enhances
charge extraction of Pt in PSC. Treatment with WO3 may
also take part similarly in modifying the electronic structure of
carbon and can be explored as a hole-transporting layer for PSC. The
electron hopping conduction mechanism is the most probable reason
behind the high electrical conductivity of the annealed WO3 at 500 °C.55 The presence of oxygen
vacancies in substoichiometric WO3 creates various defect
states of WO3, such as W4+ or W5+ and W6+, located within the band gap, respectively. These
may promote charge transfer and enhance the electrical conductivity
in the mixed valence states of W4+, W5+, and
W6+ accordingly.56,57 Also, the conductivity
measurement data mentioned in Table S3 (ESI)
clarify the performance of different devices. Besides, optimum amount
of WO3 in the hybrid carbon paste plays a vital role in
modifying the carbon counter electrode. Less amount of WO3 incorporation may result in insufficient work function of WO3 well, whereas an excessive amount may decrease the conductivity
of the carbon and also effect transparency of the device. Further,
this experimentation is comparable to those of other previous works
related to inorganic HTM for carbon-based perovskite solar cells in
the context of stability, as given in Table 2. Most of these devices have much less stability
under light illumination except for the device with Co3O4. In our case, under light illumination devices with
10% WO3 are fairly stable (∼500 h) without any substantial
loss of efficiency.

Conclusions
In conclusion, we have demonstrated here
the fully printable mesoporous
perovskite solar cells with nanoparticles incorporated in the carbon
back contact top electrode fabricated under ambient condition. These
devices show interesting stability depending on the amount of WO3 (5, 7.5, and 10% by volume) in the carbon electrode. The
efficiency increase was observed for the devices with nanoparticles
in comparison to those without. The highest efficiency was obtained
with the 7.5% WO3 device, but the stability of devices
with 10% WO3 is more pronounced. The results suggest that
depending on the amount of efficient additives, the device performance
can be influenced remarkably. The obtained maximum efficiency was
lower than the values reported for other PSCs; however, with all factors
taken into account, the proposed option might emerge as be much more
realistic and, thus, more promising. Further, this work demonstrates
that the concentration variation of WO3 can improve the
stability significantly for uncapped devices in open air conditions
under light. This constitutes an important step toward the efficiency
improvement of the devices for futuristic photoelectrochromic or self-powered
switchable glazing for low-energy adaptive façade integration.

Experimental Section
Device Fabrication
In details, the first step (step
a) resembles etching of the fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) glass substrate.
Next, TiO2 compact layer was spin-coated at 2000 rpm for
30 s on the etched clean FTO transparent glass by using 0.15 M titanium
di-isopropoxide bis-(acetylacetonate) Ti(acac)2OiPr2 (75 wt % in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich) (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich)
solution in 2-propanol, followed by drying at 115 °C for 5 min.
This step is repeated for one more time, and finally the coated samples
were then placed on a hot plate at a temperature of 415 ± 10
°C for 30 min followed by cooling to room temperature (step b).
The mesoporous TiO2 layer was deposited by spin coating
at 2500 rpm for 30 s using diluted TiO2 paste (18NRT from
Great Cell Solar Company; w/w = 1:3.5 in ethanol) and heated at 500
°C for 60 min (step c). After cooling down to room temperature,
lithium doping was carried out via spin coating (3000 rpm, 15 s) of
0.1 M lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI) solution
in acetonitrile followed by annealing at 415 ± 15 °C for
30 min (step d). Then, the Al2O3 mesoporous
layer was spin-coated with diluted Al2O3 paste
(Sigma-Aldrich; v/v = 1:2 in isopropanol) at 2000 rpm for 30 s and
heated at 150 °C for 30 min (step e). To prepare the carbon paste
for back contact, 1.2 g of graphite powder (Sigma-Aldrich) was mixed
with 0.2 g of carbon black powder (Alfa Aesar) in 4.0 mL of α-terpineol
(Sigma-Aldrich). Then, 0.1 g of ZrO2 powder (Sigma-Aldrich),
1.5 g of ethyl cellulose (15 wt % in ethanol) (Sigma-Aldrich), and
three different amounts (5, 7.5, and 10% by volume) of WO3–x nanoparticle ink (2.5 wt % in isopropanol, Sigma-Aldrich)
were added to the above paste, followed by ball milling overnight.
Thus, the prepared carbon paste was screen-printed above the mesoporous
Al2O3 layer to obtain a mesoscopic carbon layer,
which was sintered at 450 °C for 30 min (Step f). The MAPbI3 perovskite solution was prepared via the ion-exchange method.
In short, 0.198 g of CH3NH3I (Sigma-Aldrich)
and 0.573 g of PbI2 (Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 1
mL of γ-butyrolactone (Sigma-Aldrich) and then stirred at 60
°C overnight.41 After cooling down
to room temperature, the perovskite precursor solution with an appropriate
amount was infiltrated by drop casting via the top of the carbon counter
electrode and further spin coating at 1000 rpm for 15 s. At last,
drying was done at 50 °C for 1 h (Step g). Finally, the PSC was
employed for further characterization and measurements. Note: All
of the data represented here are the average measurement of five individual
fabricated m-PSC devices for each case. Their corresponding photovoltaic
performance was monitored since last 6 months with negligible hysteresis
effect and high reliability and repeatability at ambient condition.
Every individual m-PCSs were measured in every 24 h up to 500 h to
check their photovoltaic performance and stability. The cells were
fabricated and stored at ambient condition for all of the cases. Box
and whisker plot of efficiency measurements indicated the error range
recorded during the period of device measurement (Figure S2, ESI).

Characterization
X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses of
the fabricated PSC films were carried out on a X’pert pro MPD
XRD of PANalytical with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å).
The cross-sectional thickness measurement and elemental mapping of
the PSC were recorded on a scanning electron microscope (SEM), (LEO
430i, Carl Zeiss). Further, testing of the PSC was executed under
1000 W/m2 of light from a Wacom AAA continuous solar simulator
(model: WXS-210S-20, AM 1.5 G). The I–V characteristic
of the devices was recorded using an EKO MP-160 I–V Tracer. EIS measurements were carried out with an AUTOLAB frequency
analyzer setup equipped with an AUTOLAB PGSTAT 10 and a Frequency
Response Analyzer (FRA) Module. The measurements were performed under
the same solar simulator condition with the frequency range from 0.1
to 100 kHz. All of the devices were measured at the 0.70 V open-circuit
voltage of the devices. The experimental data were fitted with the
Z-view software (version 3.4d, Scribner Associates, Inc.) using appropriate
equivalent circuits. Incident photon to current efficiency (IPCE)
was carried out on a BENTHAM PVE300 Photovoltaic EQE (IPCE) and IQE
solution under 350–750 nm wavelength using a tungsten halogen
lamp source.46 The conductivity measurements
were performed using the Ossila (UK) Four-Point Probe Instrument.
All of the data presented are an average of measurements taken on
three different devices.
