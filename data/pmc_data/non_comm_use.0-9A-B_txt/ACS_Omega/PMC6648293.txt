To understand the
degradation mechanism of the copper-ion-exchanged
SSZ-13 (Cu-SSZ-13) is of high significance for rationally designing
a zeolitic catalyst for ammonia-selective catalytic reduction of NOx (NH3-SCR). In this work, we focused
on an Al-rich Cu-SSZ-13 and studied its structural degradation under
hydrothermal conditions through a set of characterization techniques,
including in situ X-ray diffraction (XRD), pair distribution function
analysis and transmission electron microscopy–energy dispersive
X-ray analysis (TEM–EDX). The results indicated that the chabazite
structure tends to contract in the c direction upon
hydrothermal treatment and consequently leads to the collapse of the
four-membered ring. Such a structure change then results in the movement
of isolated Cu2+ species from the face of the double six-membered
ring to its center, which damages the structure further. However,
the larger rings (6MRs and 8MRs) partially remain during the structure
degradation, which possibly explains that some of the isolated Cu2+ species are alive even when the XRD-detectable crystallinity
completely loses. The particle-by-particle observations through TEM–EDX
analysis suggested that the occurrence of structural degradation differs
remarkably from one individual particle to another. In general, particles
with smaller size, having a lower Si/Al ratio and a higher Cu/Al ratio,
tend to degrade easily. These results offer a thorough understanding
of the structural degradation of Cu-SSZ-13 from the microscopic point
of view and point out that the uniformity in composition and particle
size of the zeolites plays a critical role in the early-stage degradation.

1 Introduction
Zeolites
are crystalline porous materials that are composed of
tetrahedral aluminosilicates.1,2 The presence of tetrahedral
AlO4 units brings about negative charges, which offer ion-exchange
sites to accommodate cations. When the cation is a proton, Brønsted
acidity is generated, which is an important aspect that determines
the catalytic performance of zeolites in certain reactions.3−5 Various metallic cations can also be ion-exchanged into zeolites,
creating potential active centers that broaden the catalytic applications
of zeolites.6,7 One prominent example of commercial
applications of zeolites is ammonia-selective catalytic reduction
(NH3-SCR) of NOx.8−10 Efforts in applying metal-ion-exchanged zeolites on the SCR of NOx date back to 1980s when Iwamoto et al. discovered
the catalytic activities of copper-ion-exchanged FAU and MFI zeolites
for the decomposition of NO.11,12 Due to structural degradation
of medium- and large-pore zeolites (e.g., MFI and FAU) under severe
hydrothermal aging conditions, however, such copper-ion-exchanged
zeolites had not been utilized in real engines.13 In recent years, copper-ion-exchange SSZ-13, a small-pore
zeolite with chabazite structure, has been found to possess excellent
hydrothermal stability (stable against aging temperatures above 700
°C).14−18 In addition, compared to conventional catalysts like TiO2–V2O5–WO3, Cu-SSZ-13
possesses a wider temperature range for NOx conversion. Therefore, Cu-SSZ-13 has already been commercialized
as an NH3-SCR catalyst for NOx abatement in diesel engines.19

Hydrothermal stability is an important aspect to the application
of zeolites as it dictates their catalytic performances. Typically,
amorphization of zeolites occurs in hydrothermal aging conditions,
causing structural degradation.20,21 In the previous work
by Maugé et al., it was supposed that H2O tends
to attack the aluminum sites, which results in dealumination and consequently
structural amorphization.22 Therefore,
increasing the silica-to-aluminum ratio (Si/Al ratio) of a zeolite
is one means of improving its hydrothermal stability because the dealumination
could be minimized. However, the high-silica zeolites offer fewer
framework aluminums that can create ion-exchange sites to accommodate
the cations for catalytic reactions. Specific to Cu-SSZ-13 for NH3-SCR application, an SSZ-13 zeolite with a too high Si/Al
ratio is not favored because its performance in the low temperature
range is not ideal.23 Rather, Al-rich Cu-SSZ-13
zeolites are on the trend because they enable a high copper loading
together with abundant Brønsted acidity that is beneficial to
the SCR activity over a broad temperature.24−26 Nevertheless,
a thorough understanding of the degradation mechanism of Cu-SSZ-13
from a microscopic point of view is of high significance yet still
lacking. In this work, we attempt to clarify the degradation mechanism
of the Al-rich Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst from a microscopic point of view
through various characterization techniques such as X-ray diffraction
(XRD)-Rietveld refinement, pair distribution function (PDF) analysis,
and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). These results, identifying
the factors that are responsible for structural degradation, demonstrate
that nonuniformity is the major reason accounting for the early-stage
degradation of the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst.

2 Results
and Discussion
The Cu-SSZ-13 sample was prepared according
to the recipe described
elsewhere, and the procedure can also be found in the Supporting Information. The Si/Al ratio of Cu-SSZ-13
was 6.5, and the copper loading was ca. 3.6 wt %. This Cu-SSZ-13 was
proved to rival the mainstream zeolitic NH3-SCR catalyst
on the market as it possesses high hydrothermal stability and good
NH3-SCR performance;26 yet,
it is still susceptible to severe hydrothermal treatments. We first
investigated, from the microscopic point of view, how the amorphization
of the Cu-SSZ-13 catalyst evolves under hydrothermal aging conditions. Figure 1 shows the changes
in relative crystallinity of Cu-SSZ-13 with respect to hydrothermal
temperatures. It can be seen that the crystallinity changed very slightly
(decreased by less than 6%) when the temperature was lower than 750
°C, indicating that the sample was quite stable against moderate
aging treatments. Although a sharp drop in the crystallinity was observed
when the hydrothermal temperature was 800 °C and above, only
a crystallinity of 1.8% was observed after the hydrothermal treatment
at 830 °C. This observation is consistent with the tendency revealed
in previous studies on Cu-SSZ-13.26 We
further studied the dependence of the amount of isolated Cu2+ species on the crystallinity. As seen from Figure S1, the decrease of the isolated Cu2+ species was
initially in line with the crystallinity (for example, ca. 75% amount
of Cu2+ species remained when the crystallinity decreased
to 73%). However, the amount of Cu2+ species remained stable
at ca. 55–58% when the crystallinity further decreased (to
even 0%). This result indicates that the presence of isolated Cu2+ species does not necessarily rely on the preservation of
crystallinity. However, crystallinity is of high importance to the
catalytic performance, as microporosity decreased with crystallinity,
which resulted in a considerable loss in catalytic activity. In addition,
the 27Al MAS NMR spectra in Figure S2 show the coordination state of the aluminum species. The
peak centering at ca. 50 ppm, representing the tetrahedral aluminum,
can be observed on the samples hydrothermally treated at a temperature
below 750 °C. A higher hydrothermal temperature could result
in the disappearance of the peak for tetrahedral aluminum, while no
other peaks were observed, probably because NMR invisible aluminum
species were generated along with the progressing of dealumination.

Figure 1 Cu/SSZ-13
degradation curve by XRD. The hydrothermal stability
test was conducted at several temperatures for 5 h in flowing air
containing 10% H2O.

To probe the structural evolution taking place under the
hydrothermal
aging condition, in situ XRD measurement was carried out. A homemade
setup was designed (Figure S3), which allowed
us to accurately collect the XRD data under controlled hydrothermal
conditions (see temperature program in Figure S4). Figure 2 shows degradation curves reflected by relative intensities for three
representative peaks at 9.55° (hkl = 101), 20.90°
(hkl = 211), and 13.09° (hkl = 110), which are denoted hereafter as the 1st peak, 2nd peak, and
3rd peak, respectively. A full range of the time-resolved XRD patterns
can be found in Figure S5. Almost no degradation
was observed from the intensity of these peaks after 1 h of hydrothermal
aging. The intensity of the 2nd peak decreased by 9% after 2 h and
further decreased to 27% after 8 h of hydrothermal aging, whereas
the intensities of both the 1st and 3rd peaks remained at ca. 97 and
40% after aging periods of 2 and 8 h, respectively. This result indicates
that the degradation did not proceed isotropically but exhibited different
rates in different directions. To further interpret the in situ XRD
data, Rietveld refinement of the XRD patterns collected at 0, 3.3,
6.6, and 14.4 h of hydrothermal aging was performed. Figure S6 shows the changes in the unit cell refined after
different time intervals, which suggests that the chabazite structure
tended to contract in the c direction while remain
almost unaffected in the a and b directions. The refinement results further revealed that the structure
degradation is an anisotropic process, which, not beyond expectation,
is consistent with the peak intensity results in Figure 2.

peak intensities measured by in situ XRD.

In addition, the maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis of
the time-resolved
XRD patterns (also collected at 0, 3.3, 6.6, and 14.4 of hydrothermal
aging) was also performed.27,28 The electron density
distribution maps in Figure 3 indicate that the copper cations migrated alongside the degradation
of the chabazite structure. After the aging of 3.3 h, the crystallinity
was about 90%, where the location of the copper cations did not change
too much, and only a small deviation of the unit cell parameter in
the c direction was observed. After the aging of
6.6 h, only a crystallinity of 50% remained. In such a case, the location
of the copper cations was observed to move considerably, from the
face of the D6R to its center. While after the aging of 14.4 h, only
a crystallinity of 30% remained, and the copper cations were found
to locate in the center of the double six-membered ring (D6R).

maps determined by the maximum entropy method. (An illustration of
the CHA structure is shown on top of this figure. Color of the elements:
Cu, yellow; Si, blue; O, red. The green color denotes the electron
density information calculated from MEM).

In a pioneer work by Fickel and Lobo,29 the location of the Cu cations as well as the thermal stability
of a Cu-SSZ-13 sample was studied by variable-temperature XRD. According
to their results, the chabazite structure tends to contract in the a direction in the temperature range of 200–800 °C
(from ca. 13.53 Å to ca. 13.43 Å), whereas in the c direction, the unit cell undergoes a slight expansion
from ca. 15.00 Å at 200 °C to ca. 15.02 Å at 800 °C,
with a peak reaching ca. 15.05 Å at 350 °C. While in our
case, the refinement of the in situ XRD results (Figure S6) demonstrated a different scenario that the unit
cell of the Cu-SSZ-13 exhibits a considerable shrinkage in the c direction (from ca. 14.93 Å to ca. 14.84 Å)
while maintaining its dimensions in the a and b directions. It is worth noting that the two Cu-SSZ-13
samples bear little difference in terms of composition. Nevertheless,
the conditions for the in situ XRD measurement remarkably differed.
In the work by Fickel and Lobo, the temperature-variable XRD measurements
were carried out in an atmosphere of 5% O2/He mixture,
without the addition of any water. In contrast, we performed the in
situ XRD measurement in humid air containing 10 vol % H2O, a common atmosphere used for hydrothermal stability tests, which
is considered to be responsible for the different structure degradation
observed. Considering the above results, it could be inferred that
the chabazite structure tends to contract in the c direction under hydrothermal conditions, which drives the copper
cations to move from the face of D6R to its center and causes the
structure degradation further.

X-ray total scattering together
with PDF analysis was performed
to understand the structure of the amorphization taking place in the
hydrothermal aging. Figure S7 compares
the pair distribution function, G(r) (obtained by a Fourier transformation of the total structure factors, S(Q)), for the fully crystalline and completely
degraded samples. From the PDF, various atomic distances concerning
framework connectivity can be identified, which allowed us to analyze
the structural difference between these two types of materials.30−33 From this comparison, it can be seen that the peak centering at
3.8 Å (representing the correlation in the four-membered ring
(4MR)) for the degraded sample became less pronounced with respect
to that for the fully crystalline sample, probably because the 4MR
in the degraded sample had collapsed. In contrast, the peaks centering
at 4.1 Å, which represent the correlation in the six-membered
ring (6MR) and eight-membered ring (8MR), maintained the same intensity
after amorphization, indicating the preservation of the larger ring
structures. These results suggest that the degradation of the chabazite
structure could probably start from the collapse of the 4MRs.

On the basis of the characterizations at the atomic level, a degradation
mechanism was proposed as shown in Figure 4. The contraction of the structure starts
from the c direction, which drives the copper cations
to move from the face of the D6R to the center. The copper cations
remained to some extent to be the isolated Cu2+ species,
which minimizes the direct contact between two coppers and thus reduces
the possibility of forming CuOx clusters
(or even CuO phase), which was supposed to be a major reason for structural
degradation of Cu-SSZ-13. With the progress of the hydrothermal aging,
the larger rings (6MRs and 8MRs) maintained their connection, although
considerable amorphization occurs until the crystallinity reaches
0%. Because of the preservation of the larger rings, some of the isolated
copper species could be protected even though the sample becomes completely
degraded.

Figure 4 Proposed degradation scheme for Cu-SSZ-13.

The above mechanism, proposed on the basis of the XRD and
PDF results,
provides an explanation at the microscopic level. To identify the
factors governing the degradation at the early stage from other microscopic
points of view, TEM observation together with EDX analysis was carried
out to study the size, composition, and crystallinity of each particle.
Statistical analysis was then conducted on the basis of the data collected
on individual particles. The TEM observation as well as EDX analysis
was performed using powder samples. As the particle size of the Cu-SSZ-13
was in the range of several hundred nanometers (up to 500 nm), the
measurement was feasible. The accuracy of the statistical analysis
could be reflected by the error bars, which are associated with the
averaged values. To describe the diameter of the particles, diagonal
diameter was used, as the Cu-SSZ-13 samples had a cubic morphology.
Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis could provide the
level of crystallinity of the particle observed, as a halo was observed
in the case of amorphous particles but spot patterns were observed
for the crystalline ones. Representative TEM images and the corresponding
SAED analysis results of a set of samples are provided in Figure S8.

Table 1 shows the
statistic data for three representative samples with different levels
of crystallinity (100, 86, and 0%). In the fully crystalline sample
(100% in crystallinity), there was no particle on which an amorphous
halo was observed. In the sample with a crystallinity of 86%, 29%
of the particles were considered to be amorphous from the TEM–SAED
analysis as a halo was observed, and 71% of the particles were confirmed
to be crystalline. In the case of the fully degraded sample (0% in
crystallinity), all particles were considered to be amorphous from
the TEM–SAED analysis. From these results, we can see that
the tendency observed from the TEM–SAED analysis is consistent
with the results of powdered XRD. Interesting conclusion, however,
could be reached if we give a closer look. From the TEM–SAED
analysis, no transitional state, which means a mixture of crystalline
and amorphous parts, was observed in any single particle (Figure 5). This result suggests
that the amorphization of the Cu-SSZ-13 could occur suddenly when
a critical condition was met and that the amorphization did not spread
uniformly but happened first to those that were vulnerable. To better
understand such a mechanism, the nature of the particle (crystalline
vs amorphous) was plotted in two parameter settings (particle size
vs Cu/Al ratio and particle size vs Si/Al ratio) in Figure 6. In the synthesis of zeolites,
a uniform particle size distribution is generally difficult to achieve.
The final average particle size and particle size distribution of
the zeolite product are dependent upon the competition between the
timing of nucleation and crystal growth. However, the timing of nucleation
of zeolite crystallization is very complicated and challenging to
control.34,35 In the case of nucleation taking place at
an early stage, the crystal growth of each nucleus has abundant time
to consume the nutrients, which may result in large particle size,
whereas in the case of nucleation taking place in a later time, small
particle size may be obtained. In addition, the Cu/Al ratio as well
as the Si/Al ratio within a particle also matters. The Si/Al ratio
is largely determined by the synthesis parameters, such as type of
the structure-directing agent, raw materials, synthesis temperature,
etc., and in most cases, the distribution of aluminum atoms and thereof
the local Si/Al ratio are difficult to control.36 On the contrary, the Cu/Al ratio can be adjusted through
postsynthesis treatment, while the local Cu/Al ratio could vary depending
on the nature of the parent zeolite as well as the parameters of the
postsynthesis treatment.37 Such aspects
suggest that the Si/Al ratio as well as the Cu/Al ratio could also
be nonuniform among the individual particles. From Figure 6, it can be clearly seen that
amorphization first happened to the particles with smaller particle
size.

by TEM–EDX. Five spots from one particle were selected to obtain
the compositional information, and therefore the Cu/Al and Si/Al ratios
were presented with an average bar.

a The crystallinity was calculated
taking the fresh sample as a reference.

The nature of the particle was further plotted in
terms of the
Cu/Al ratio vs the Si/Al ratio (Figure 7). The result indicates that amorphization tended to
occur on the particles that had a lower Si/Al ratio and a higher Cu/Al
ratio. It is generally considered that a sample with a higher Si/Al
ratio should have higher hydrothermal stability, which was again confirmed
by our result. In addition, the hydrothermal stability of the Cu-SSZ-13
catalyst is also supposed to depend on the Cu/Al ratio.38 While our result in Figure 7, obtained from the statistical analysis
based on a particle-by-particle measurement, confirms that a high
Cu/Al ratio is not favored for the hydrothermal stability. Since the
particle size was relatively small (which ranged from 250 to 500 nm),
a gradual amorphization was not observed. It was speculated that the
particle started to contract in the c direction under
the hydrothermal aging condition, which suddenly drove the crystalline
structure to collapse. Therefore, the uniformity of the sample plays
an important role as a sample that is homogeneous in particle size,
and Si/Al and Cu/Al ratios could be beneficial for the parameter screening
toward the enhancement of the overall hydrothermal stability.

3 Conclusions
In summary,
we have focused on an Al-rich Cu-SSZ-13 zeolite and
clarified the factors governing its structural degradation under hydrothermal
treatment. A collective effort by in situ XRD (together with Rietveld
refinement) and PDF analysis revealed that the hydrothermal treatment
tends to cause the zeolite structure to contract in the c direction and then leads to the collapse of the 4MRs. Such a structural
change drives the isolated Cu2+ species to move from the
face of D6R to its center, resulting in further structural degradation.
The larger rings (6MRs and 8MRs) partially remain during the structural
degradation, which could possibly explain the facts that no octahedral
aluminum can be observed from 27Al MAS NMR and that some
of the isolated Cu2+ species remain even when the XRD-detectable
crystallinity completely loses. The results from the particle-by-particle
observations through TEM–EDX analysis suggested that the occurrence
of structural degradation was not evenly distributed among the particles.
Rather, the particles with a smaller size, having a lower Si/Al ratio
and a higher Cu/Al ratio, tended to degrade easily. These results
demonstrate a study of the structural degradation of Cu-SSZ-13 from
a microscopic point of view and provide insights into the design of
NH3-SCR catalysts. The findings point out that controlling
the chemical composition as well as narrowing the particle size distribution,
by either bottom-up approach39 or top-down
approach,40 is an important aspect in the
synthesis of zeolites, as both the composition and morphology play
critical roles in determining the hydrothermal stability of the zeolites
and thereof the performance in practical applications.
