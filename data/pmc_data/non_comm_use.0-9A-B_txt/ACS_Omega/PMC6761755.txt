A technique
to image ion pairs in solution is reported. We investigated
structural and dynamic properties of ion-pair distributions deposited
on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces in electrolyte
solutions. Atomic force microscopy images of HOPG immersed in NaCl
and KCl solutions display regular arrangements on top of the hexagonal
carbon rings forming the HOPG atomic structure. These arrangements
are the result of the low value of the aqueous interfacial dielectric
constant (εr ≈ 3–11). The measured
ion-pair radius is a function of the salt present in the solution;
for KCl, the ion-pair radius is equal or smaller than 0.42 nm; for
NaCl, the ion-pair radius is 0.36 nm. A comparison of these values
with their crystalline lattice dimensions indicates that both KCl
and NaCl ion pairs in solution at the HOPG/solution interfacial region
exist as tight contact ion pairs in quasistationary distributions.
The NaCl ion-pair distribution forms an aligned arrangement, and the
KCl distribution is formed by intercalated pairs.

1 Introduction
Interfacial regions in
aqueous salt solution are relevant to various
physicochemical processes with implications ranging from biology to
the environment.1−6 Aqueous salt solution interfaces utilizes the Gibbs isotherm equation7 and the higher surface tension of aqueous salt
solutions relative to pure water to describe the classical form of
an interface devoid of ions.8,9 However, recently experimentalists
suggested that the presence of ions at the interface of NaI and NaBr
solutions could account for the diatomic iodine and bromine gas4 measured uptake coefficients.

Recent molecular
dynamics simulations have studied the propensity
of ions10−12 at the air–solution interface. Dynamics simulations
locate the carboxylate group anchored in the liquid and the methylated
benzene ring tilted away from the aqueous phase.13,14 Other molecular dynamics study of the interfacial structure of aqueous
solutions showed the anomalous dependence of surface tension on concentration.15

The relatively high concentration of ions
at the air–water
interface compared to that in the bulk solution contradicts the traditional
model of the surfaces of electrolytes within which atomic ions are
repelled from the air–water interface.16 The ability of water to stabilize ions is associated with its high
dielectric constant. As a consequence ions in aqueous solution are
expected to be repelled from a hydrophobic medium interface. However,
experimental evidence to the contrary was obtained by measurements
that indicated a substantial negative charge at the surface of oil
droplets, solid hydrophobic polymers, gas bubbles and thin-liquid
films.17

One of the main problems
in theories for electrolytes has been
to account for ion–ion and ion–solvent interactions.
In 1903, Arrhenius18 made the assumption
that electrolytes were completely dissociated into ions for an infinitely
dilute solution, which accounts for the thermodynamic properties of
electrolyte solutions, as shown by Debye and Huckel19 in 1923. In 1926, Bjerrum20 introduced
the ion-pair concept and how the mass action constant of the equilibrium
between ions and ion pairs was a function of the dielectric constant
of the solvent. The Bjerrum theory was strongly supported by the work
of Kraus,21 Freiser,22 Szwarc,23 and Atherton and Weissman.24

Ion-pair formation between organic ions
in solution has been shown
to produce a stable, nondissociating species, although no chemical
bond is formed between the two components.21,25 Liquid–liquid extractions,26,27 ion-exchange resins,28 solubilizing lipophilic
drug molecules,29,30 and polymerization31−33 processes are associated with the presence of stable ion pairs.
Ion pairs have also been shown to influence molecular assembly at
air–liquid interfaces35 and at the
solid–liquid interface.36

A description of ion pairing is only possible after the development
of adequate experimental methods. Previous methods have included conductivity
measurements of the electrolyte solution followed by potentiometry
and measurements of the solution thermodynamic properties. Spectroscopic
measurements and relaxation methods have also provided insights into
the nature of the ion pair.

Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is
an experimental method that has
been shown to be capable of accessing, at liquid aqueous interfaces,
the details of ionic and molecular interactions by the observation
of deposited patterns with angstrom resolution.34 Collisions of oppositely charged ions due to their thermal
motion in solution are not considered to produce stable ion pairs
per se, unless they are immersed in a region with a low dielectric
permittivity where they are stable. Ions are repelled from interfacial
regions, but the ion pairs are attracted, so in this work, we report
an AFM technique developed to image these ion pairs formed in interfacial
regions.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Imaging
Structures in Electrolyte Solutions
The standard calibration
procedures described in our previous work35 were followed by a finer scale calibration using
a freshly cleaved highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrate.
The scanners were recalibrated by setting the standard periodicity
equal to the measured periodicity.

Lateral force images show
a substantial improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio when compared
to the topographic image. Figure 1a displays an image of HOPG in air. The periodicity
indicated in Figure 1b is 0.25 ± 0.5 nm. A schematic diagram of this structure will
be employed to determine the deposited ion-pair arrangement.

Figure 1 (a) AFM contact
image of HOPG scanned in air (35% RH at 25 °C).
(b) Lateral force profile between the tip and the HOPG substrate scanned
over a distance of 2.5 nm at a scanning speed of 250 nm/s. The HOPG
lattice periodicity of 0.25 nm is indicated in the lateral force profile.
The force profile vertical direction (x-axis) corresponds
to the z-direction. In the image shown in (a) the
horizontal (x-axis) and the vertical (y-axis) dimensions have the same scale as indicated in the figure.
The scale in the z-axis is given in nm but it is
associated with the up and down movement of the tip where force F and displacement z (z-direction) are related by the cantilever spring constant.

To measure the crystalline lattice parameter 2·(r+ + r–),
where r– and r+ correspond
to the radius of Cl– and Na+, respectively,
the crystalline structure of NaCl was scanned in air. Figure 2 shows an image of a NaCl deposit
on silicon ⟨100⟩ (optically polished). A drop of 0.154
M NaCl solution was deposited onto the substrate and dried in air
(60% RH, 25 °C); then, the surface was scanned. It should be
noted that the structure corresponds to an interpenetrating face-centered
cubic lattice with a lattice parameter of ∼0.56 nm. The larger
chloride ions are arranged in a cubic close packing structure, while
the smaller sodium ions fill the octahedral gaps between them. KCl
has the same structure as NaCl but with a different lattice parameter
(0.623 nm).

Figure 2 AFM contact image of a crystalline NaCl film grown on a ⟨100⟩
Si wafer scanned in air over a distance of 4.0 nm at a speed of 200
nm/s. The measured NaCl crystal lattice periodicity of 0.56 nm is
indicated.

After measuring the crystalline
lattice parameters of KCl and NaCl,
KCl and NaCl ion-pair deposits were imaged on HOPG surfaces immersed
in water electrolytes.

Evidence for the presence of ionic pairs
on HOPG comes from the
observation of regular structures equally spaced in the x-direction obtained while scanning the substrate. Figure 3 depicts the pattern observed
by scanning the HOPG surface immersed in a 1 M NaCl solution using
a scanning speed of 200 nm/s. The image does not show clear periodicity
in the vertical direction; however, in the horizontal direction, a
periodicity of 0.73 nm is observed, as shown in the lateral force
horizontal profile below. The tip is scanned in the horizontal direction
(x-axis) which is measured, in our figure, in nm.
In diagram (b) the image depicts the z-axis. The z-direction displacement is associated with the up and down
movement of the tip and is related to the force necessary to raise
the tip when it gets in contact with a structure. The units of this
displacement are nN (nano newton) but the tip is placed on a cantilever
with a spring constant of ∼0.03 N/m. The units of these displacements
can also be nm because they are related by the spring constant.

surface immersed in 1 M NaCl solution for a scanning speed of 200
nm/s. Identical x-axis and y-axis

The scanning velocity was then increased to 300 nm/s; an
image
with a distinct periodicity was registered, which is shown in Figure 4. The measured periodicity
of the pattern is now 1.06 nm, as shown in the lateral force horizontal
profile below. The scanning speed was further increased to 500 and
600 nm/s, and the corresponding images are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively.

HOPG surfaces were then scanned following immersion in 1 M KCl
solutions, and the result for a scanning speed of 400 nm/s is shown
in Figure 7. The pattern
shows the formation of columns separated by a distance of 1.5 nm.

and the observed periodicity for the separation of columns was ∼2.0
nm and the internal columnar separation was 0.73 nm.

2.2 Force Versus Distance Profiles Measured in
the Interfacial Region
After imaging the structure of the
ion-pair deposits on HOPG surfaces by measuring their periodicities,
the ion-pair formation mechanism was investigated. The starting point
was to measure the force versus distance profiles. Figure 10 shows the measured force
between a neutral tip and a hydrophobic surface (HOPG) immersed in
NaCl solution plotted against surface separation (D). Attraction was observed starting at a separation of D ≈ 20 nm.31

Figure 10 Force vs separation
curve measured for the HOPG surface in 1 M
NaCl solution with a cantilever with a spring constant of 0.03 N/m
at t ≈ 0 min after HOPG immersion in the solution.

By probing various regions of the HOPG/water electrolyte
interface
of various substrates using different tips, we obtained force versus
separation patterns for increasing immersion times, as shown in Figures 11 and 12. These curves are very similar to those measured
for hydrophobic surfaces shown in our previous work.34 In the approaching curve with a cantilever with k ≈ 0.03 N/m a large repulsive step appears at D ≈ 25 nm as shown in Figure 11. This profile was obtained by scanning
the substrate ∼240 min after the immersion of HOPG in 1 M NaCl
solution. At large distances, D > 80 nm, the force
is negligible. Figure 12 shows a curve with a smaller repulsive component at the origin compared
to that shown in Figure 11. This image was registered ∼260 min after HOPG immersion
in 1 M NaCl solution. AFM was used to image structural arrangements
in aqueous solutions at the HOPG interface. The primary objective
of this work is to image ion pairs in solution and to measure their
sizes. Initially, the HOPG substrates were imaged in air, as shown
in Figure 1. A schematic
diagram of this structure is used to model the structural arrangements
of the deposited ion pairs. Different scanning speeds were used to
determine surface structure formation mechanisms for the ion-pair
distributions. To characterize the media where ion pairs are formed,
dielectric permittivity profiles were calculated using force versus
distance profiles.

Figure 11 Same as that shown in Figure 10 measured at t = 240 min
after HOPG
immersion in the solution, showing the time evolution of the curve.

Figure 12 Same as that shown in Figure 10 measured at t = 260 min
after HOPG
immersion in the solution, showing the time evolution of the curve.

2.3 Shape Analysis of the Force
Curves
Here, by using nanosized diameter tips, we have measured
force versus
distance curves, which are associated with the spatial variations
of the interfacial dielectric constant at a HOPG surface immersed
in electrolyte solutions. Typical force curves include various steps
in the regions close to the aqueous/air interface. These steps have
been measured by various authors.36,37 To calculate
the dielectric constant profile, we modelled the energy change involved
in the immersion of the tip inside the interfacial layer by the product
of the immersed tip volume, dielectric permittivity variation and
square of the electric field vector.34 The
tip was modelled with a conical shape flat end structure with an area
of πR2. The volume element (dv) immersed in the interaction region is given by dv = π[R + (tan α)z]2dz, where z is the
integration variable of the conical volume, and d is the distance between the substrate and the tip. The change in
the electric energy involved in the immersion is associated with the
exchange of the dielectric permittivity of the polarization layer
with that of the tip. It is calculated by integrating the exchange
energy expression over the immersed tip volume in the polarization
layer region. The force is obtained from the gradient of the energy
expression.

Figures 11 and 12 shows different scenarios with
various attractions and repulsions. The calculated dielectric permittivity
profile obtained by a best fit to the experimental curves starts at
εr ≈ 4 at the interface and increases to a
value of 11 at a distance of ∼50 nm away from the surface.

2.4 Models of the Interfacial Ion-Pair Measured
Arrangements
The permittivity varies from εr ≈ 4 at the interface to εr ≈ 11 at
a distance of ∼30 nm away from the surface, indicating a potential
region for the formation of ion pairs. The ion-pair-deposit distribution
at the interface is described below. Initially, the polytetrafluoroethylene
(PTFE) surface was scanned but no arrangement was observed, then we
used HOPG surfaces as substrates, and the images are shown in Figures 3–9. This result indicates that in order to image ion-pair
formation, another condition besides the scanning regions with a low
dielectric permittivity is necessary: substrate matrices, where ion
pairs can be orderly bound to the surface. This fixing of pairs in
an orderly manner allows the dimensions of the ion pair to be measured.

Because the tip substrate interaction during scanning results in
an applied force in the x direction (scanning direction)
and not in the orthogonal direction (y axis), the
images show arrangements without a definition in the y axis. The measured profiles indicated by yellow in the figures reflect
the ion-pair distribution, which is modeled as follows: ion pairs
indicated by blue circles are distributed in such a way that the spatial
periodicity along the scanning horizontal direction (x-axis) is in agreement with the measured periodicity and the aggregation
of ion pairs given by the width of each individual column. The scale
in the vertical direction (y-axis) is the same as
the x-axis but the image does not show a clear pattern
in the y-direction because the scanning action takes
place only along the x-direction. The periodicity
of the substrate which induces the deposit patterns was used. Using
this procedure we constructed the patterns in blue. By drawing various
arrangements we found distributions with the smallest separation in
both x- and y-directionsis a constant
and we claim that it corresponds to the diameters of the ion pairs.
Ion pairs forming the deposited structure are imaged as large yellow
patches forming vertical lines; the superimposed blue circles indicate
the modeled ion-pair positions. The pattern of the carbon atoms, as
observed by scanning bare HOPG surfaces, is indicated by small circles,
which form a hexagonal structure, and there is matching between these
two structures.

Figure 9 shows the
measured profile for an image scanned in NaCl solution with a 200
nm/s scanning speed. There is only one observed periodicity in this
profile: ∼0.73 nm. The arrangement of the ion pairs that satisfies
this measured pattern is shown in Figure 13. Ion pairs are equally spaced in the x and y directions with separations of
0.73 and 0.83 nm, respectively. The pattern adjusted to the profile
measured in 1 M NaCl using a scanning speed of 300 nm/s is shown in Figure 14. The measured
periodicity of the profile is 1.06 nm and the ion-pair distribution
that fits this pattern has an ion-pair separation of 0.73 nm in the y direction. For a higher scanning velocity of ∼500
nm/s, a distinct profile is obtained, as shown in Figure 15. The measured periodicities
in the x and y directions are 0.79
and 0.73 nm, respectively. The proposed ion-pair profile for a higher
scanning speed of 600 nm/s is shown in Figure 16. Ion pairs are separated by 0.82 nm, but
the separation of the ion pairs in the y direction
is the same as that shown in the previous Figures 13–15. The separation
of the pairs is ∼2.0 nm.

Figure 13 Model arrangement of the ion-pair deposit
on HOPG immersed in 1
M NaCl solution. The vertical profile image of the force corresponds
to a part of the profile shown in Figure 3 (span ≈ 0–4 nm) for a scanning
speed of 200 nm/s. The vertical yellow columns indicate the ion-pair-measured
profile, small circles indicate the carbon atom distribution on the
HOPG surface and the large circles indicate the position of the ion-pair
distribution. The separation distance for two ion pairs is 0.73 nm,
which is equal to the ion-pair diameter.

Figure 14 Same
as that shown in Figure 13 corresponding to the image shown in Figure 4 scanned at a scanning speed
of 300 nm/s. The peak separation given by the vertical force profile
is 1.06 nm but the separation distance of the two ion pairs is 0.73
nm, which is equal to the ion-pair diameter.

Figure 15 Same
as that shown in Figure 13 corresponding to the image shown in Figure 5 scanned at scanning speed
of 500 nm/s. The modeled profile interval is 4–8.5 nm and the
separation of two ion pairs is 0.73; consequently the size (diameter)
of the ion pair is 0.73 nm.

Figure 16 Same
as that shown in Figure 13 corresponding to the image shown in Figure 6 scanned at a velocity of 600
nm/s. The modeled profile interval is 4–8.5 nm and the separation
distance of two ion pairs is 0.73 nm. The ion-pair measured diameter
is 0.73 nm.

Next, let us analyze the profile
measured for KCl ion pairs. Figure 7 shows the profile
that corresponds to the image obtained for a scanning speed of 400
nm/s. The modeled profile is shown in Figure 17.

Figure 17 Model arrangement of an ion-pair deposit on
HOPG immersed in 1
M KCl solution. The vertical profile image of the force corresponds
to a part of the profile shown in Figure 7 (span ≈ 0–4 nm). The vertical
yellow columns indicate measured arrangement of the ion-pair distribution,
the small circle indicates the C atoms of the HOPG surface distribution
and the large circles indicate the position of the ion pairs in the
arrangement. Two periodicities are observed, 1.47 nm for the large
separation and 1.09 nm for the small separation. This arrangement
indicated the formation of pairs of ion pairs. The separation distance
of two ion pairs (diameter of the ion pair) is 0.82 nm.

Here, two periodicities are clearly observed: one periodicity
formed
by a pair of ion pairs with a separation of 1.47 nm and a second periodicity
for a pair of ion with a separation of 1.09 nm. The separation in
the y direction is 0.83 nm, which is distinct from
the value measured for NaCl (0.73 nm).

Figure 18 shows
the arrangement that fits the profile for the 500 nm/s scanning speed
shown in Figure 8.
The width of the measured profile indicates that KCl ion pairs form
intercalated structures that are distinct from the isolated ion pairs
formed for NaCl. As in the previous image, the separation of the ion
pairs in the y direction is 0.83 nm. Finally, Figure 19 shows the profile
and the suggested pattern for the KCl ion-pair distribution obtained
when scanning the HOPG surface with a speed of 600 nm/s. Intercalated
ion pairs are formed with a horizontal separation of 0.73 nm, as indicated
in the figure, and the distance between the ion pairs in the y direction is the same as those shown in Figures 12 and 13. Therefore, our results show two differences between the KCl and
NaCl ion-pair arrangements: KCl ion pairs aggregate, forming intercalated
ion-pair arrangements, while NaCl ion pairs form aligned pairs. The
second difference lies in the ion-pair diameters.

Figure 18 Same as that shown in Figure 17 corresponding
to the image shown in Figure 8 scanned at a velocity of 500
nm/s. The modeled profile interval is 4–8.5 nm and the separation
distance for the ion pairs is 0.82 nm, which is equal to the ion-pair
diameter.

Figure 19 Same as that shown in Figure 17 corresponding to the image
shown in Figure 9 scanned
at a velocity of 600
nm/s. The modeled profile interval is 4–8.5 nm and the separation
distance of the ion pairs is 0.82 nm in the horizontal direction and
0.73 in the vertical direction. The aggregation of pairs of ion pairs
is clearly shown by the formation of columns of two ion pairs. The
separation distance of two ion pairs (the diameter of the ion pair)
is 0.82 nm.

Ions cannot approach each other
more closely than the distance
of the closest approach a due to the
strong repulsive forces of the electron shells of the ions. The distance a is understood to bear some relation to
the sum of the crystal ionic radii of the positively charged r+ ions and the negatively charged r– ions,
with a ≥r+ + r–. By comparing the size of the measured ion-pair
radii with the sum of the crystal ionic radii, we can determine the
solvent distribution in the observed ionic-pair patterns.

The
work of Sadek and Fuoss38 and that
of Winstein et al.,39 later confirmed by
Roberts and Szwarc,40 showed that an ion
pair can exist in two forms: as a tight or intimate ion pair, or as
a loose or solvent-separated ion pair, depending on the nature of
the solvent–ion interaction. An ion possessing a tight solvation
shell may approach a counter ion without hindrance until its solvation
shell contacts the partner. Then either the associate maintains its
structure as a loose, solvent-separated ion pair or the solvent molecules
separating the partners are squeezed out and a tight contact ion pair
is formed. Here, measurements of the ion pair distribution patterns
in various electrolyte solutions determine the separation of two ion
pairs in solution, and it is then possible to define if ions are at
the distance of the closest approach, not hydrated solvent separated,
or solvent shared. Arrangements were observed for NaCl, and the distance
measured between the paired ions is ∼0.72 nm, consequently
the ion-pair radius is 0.36 nm, and because the periodicity of the
NaCl crystal is 0.56 nm, which is twice the separation of NaCl in
the crystalline lattice, the ions are at the distance of closest approach.
For KCl, a similar arrangement of ion pairs was obtained, and the
measured separation for these ion pairs is 0.85 nm, resulting in an
ion-pair radius of 0.42 nm; the ionic separation in the KCl crystal
is 0.62 nm (the ion-pair radius is 0.31 nm). Then, the ions in the
KCl ion pair are also at the distance of the closest approach.

Now, let us compare the measured dimensions of the ion pairs with
the Bjerrum cutoff distance q calculated
for the experimental configuration used in this work. We have measured
the interfacial dielectric permittivity at the HOPG surface and have
observed a variable time-dependent dielectric permittivity profile.
The calculated interfacial dielectric permittivity profile at the
HOPG/water region shows values starting at εr ≈
4 at the HOPG surface, which then increases to εr ≈ 11 at a distance of ∼50 nm from the surface. Therefore,
we used these values in the Bjerrum cutoff distance, which is given
by , where kB is
the Boltzmann constant, T is the thermodynamic (Kelvin)
temperature and εr·ε0 = ε
is the dielectric permittivity. Bjerrum suggested that all oppositely
charged pairs of ions at a distance smaller or equal to q should be considered as associated ion pairs. For
εr ≈ 80, the calculated value of q is 0.348 nm, which is smaller than the measured
radius for the KCl and NaCl pairs, consequently there is no ion-pair
formation in the KCl and NaCl solution in bulk water. For the measured
interfacial dielectric permittivity values, initially for εr ≈ 4, the value of q is
calculated to be 6.96 nm, and for εr ≈ 11 q is 2.53 nm. The measured value of the ion-pair
size then satisfies the criterion that the ion-pair radius R = (r+ + r–) is smaller than the Bjerrum length q.

Eigen and Tamm41,42 developed a multistage ion-association
treatment for the interpretation of sound adsorption relaxation processes
in electrolyte solutions. The sound waves cause alternate compression
and expansion of the solution and the concentration of the ion pairs
responds to the pressure changes with a relaxation time τ. To
explain the time dependence, they assumed that a multistage ion-pair
formation process takes place from solvated-separated ion pairs through
solvent-shared ion pairs to contact ion pairs. In our experimental
setup, the scanning movement causes alternative compression and expansion
of the solution, and because the ion-pair concentration responds to
pressure changes,41,42 we observed a multistage ion-pair
aggregation process, resulting in distinct ion-pair configurations
for distinct scanning speeds (see Figures 13–19).

2.5 Mechanism of Ion Pair Pattern Formation in
Interfacial Regions
All these results consistently indicate
that the patterns represent oriented arrangements of ion pairs attached
on or near a HOPG surface. However, one may ask whether these patterns
are attached on the hydrophobic surface from the beginning or generated
during the scanning of the surface. Because identical scanning should
result in identical patterns, as observed, we considered that the
periodicity of the patterns is associated with the relative motion
of the substrate/tip. A sharp tip is brought into contact with the
ion-pair covered surface and a lateral force imposed by the substrate
scanning displaces the ion pairs parallel to the surface along the
scanning direction (the x direction). Figures 3–9 show the lateral force profiles measured upon scanning ion pairs
adsorbed on a HOPG surface at room temperature. Then, during lateral
sliding, for which the tip comes into contact with the edge of the
ion pair, the cantilever deforms elastically, changing the lateral
force. The lateral force increases until the tip can rise over the
ion pairs. The ion-pair substrate forces are not the weak van der
Waals force but are the force gradient associated with the variation
of the interfacial permittivity. The ion-pair motion induced by the
substrate displacement placed the ion pairs at the center of the HOPG
structural hexagonal arrangement of C atoms. Because the ion pairs
experience a weakly corrugated potential along the surface, we were
able to arrange ion pairs in a variety of patterns on a HOPG surface,
see Figures 13–19. The long-range electrostatic force that keeps
the partners of an ion pair together are nondirectional; however,
at the surface, the spatial distribution of the interfacial dielectric
permittivity has a large gradient in the normal direction to the surface,
which fixes the ion pair to the surface. Therefore, scanning, that
is, the relative motion of the tip-substrate generates a pattern with
a periodicity in the scanning direction. This periodicity changes
with the scanning speed, indicating a mechanism similar to that described
by Eigen and Tamm.41,42 Let us define a formation time
as follows: because the arrangement was formed by the scanning of
the substrate, there is a formation time involved which corresponds
the time that is taken by the tip to go from one ion-pair column to
the next (spatial periodicity). Ion pairs are not formed by the tip
but only their arrangement, because we are observing a constructed
structure, which is used to measure the ion-pair spatial period; we
defined a formation time as the time that takes the tip to transit
one ion-pair column to the next column. This formation time is a constant,
independent of the scanning speed, as shown in Figure 20, but the formation time varies with the
electrolyte.

Figure 20 Formation time of the constructed structure defined as
the size
of the structure divided by the scanning speed. This formation time
is independent of the scanning speed. The NaCl and KCl arrangements
are indicated by ▲ and ■, respectively.

The separation of the ion pairs along the vertical direction
(y-axis) is determined only by the pair–pair
repulsion
and by the substrate arrangement, because there is not a clear measured
pattern in this direction. Images also show that NaCl forms aligned
ion pairs and that KCL forms intercalated structure pairs. The image
resolution is not sufficient to determine if ion triplets are formed
by the long-range electrostatic forces induced by the spatially variable
interfacial dielectric constant profile; however, the intercalation
of ion pairs was observed.

3 Conclusions
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that real
images of ion pairs in solutions have been reported. The fixing of
ion pairs in an orderly manner allows the dimension of the ion pair
to be measured. Here, we have combined ion–ion interactions
with solid–liquid interface electric fields, so that intramolecular
interactions in solution (which govern the formation of the ion pairs)
and intermolecular forces (which govern the self-assembly of the ion
pairs) at the solid–liquid interface are responsible for the
formation of the observed structure.

AFM images of a substrate
immersed in the electrolyte solution
show a periodic arrangement of NaCl and KCl ion pairs adsorbed on
a HOPG surface with lattice parameters of <1 nm. Induced ion-pair
arrangements were observed in water electrolytes at room temperature.
The intermolecular forces were measured by probing the dielectric
permittivity at the interface, which showed values as low as ε
≈ 3–11. Therefore, we suggest that this distribution
is responsible for the ion-pair formation mechanism at HOPG surfaces.

The presence of ion pairs on the surface is detected from AFM signal
profiles. Under the shear stress induced by the substrate motion during
the scanning action, ionic structures are restructured and the scanning-velocity-dependent
profiles are measured. The fact that the ion-pair assembly on HOPG
cannot be broken via AFM contact, scanning suggests the existence
of binding interactions between a neutral ion pair and the interface
plane because of the water/HOPG hydrophobic structure. These findings
may be useful in understanding the stability of ion pairs formed within
polyelectrolyte films,43 and have the potential
to impact micro- and nanoscale device fabrication which is associated
with this molecular assembly control and stability.44,45 Systematic control over the molecular spacing between ion pairs
on surfaces has been a challenge. In this work, we show that ion-pair
formation proceeds through a two-step process involving an initial
pair formation on the interfacial region followed by the gradual reordering
of ion-pair complexes into periodically ordered arrangements in the
scanning directions.

The distance between ions in solution below
which ions are to be
considered paired is given by the Bjerrum cutoff distance q. The crystalline ion-pair size (r+ + r–) is measured
to be 0.37 nm for NaCl and 0.41 nm for KCl, and the distance q is 0.34 for bulk water with εr ≈ 80, which is smaller than the distance measured
for ion-pair separation; consequently, no KCl or NaCl ion pairs are
observed in bulk water. The corresponding values of q for the measured interfacial permittivity values
in our experimental setup are q = 7
nm for εr = 4 and q = 2.53 nm for εr = 11; therefore, KCl and NaCl
ion-pair formation is possible in the probed interfacial region. We
have observed the formation of tight ion pairs in both KCl and NaCl
solutions, and ion-pair-measured sizes satisfy the two criteria reported
by Marcus and Hefter46 in their theoretical
considerations.

4 Experimental Section
Ion-pair detection is a difficult task because direct methods do
not exist to measure the presence of such species in solutions. Only
indirect methods such as the variation of mass not associated with
charge variation in quartz microbalance measurements are available.
Here, by using a hydrophobic matrix of the carbon atom HOPG surface,
we deposited ion pairs at the interfacial region forming a regular
observable structure.

The atomic force microscope is adequate
equipment available for
scanning surfaces in liquids, with a few angstroms of spatial resolution
in the scanned plane and 0.01 nm in the normal direction, so we used
AFM to scan the HOPG substrates in water electrolytes and image the
adsorbed structure on this surface. An atomic force microscope (model
TMX2000, TopoMetrix, CA, USA) equipped with a silicon nitrite (Si3N4) tip (model MSCT-AUHW, Microlevers, Veeco, CA,
USA) with a spring constant of approximately 0.03 N/m was used to
scan over the HOPG surfaces in aqueous electrolyte solutions. The
radius of curvature of these AFM tips was approximately 5 nm. The
sample surface maps consisted of 300 × 300 grid points. The best
signal-to-noise ratio was obtained for a scan velocity of 200 nm/s
for HOPG in air.

HOPG was cleaved with an adhesive tape in air,
and then, the sample
was immediately transferred to a chamber in which the atomic force
microscope head was enclosed. Samples with a 1 × 1 cm2 area, several tenths of a millimeter thick were used without any
previous treatment. The AFM contact and lateral force images indicated
that the surface was atomically flat. Freshly cleaved surfaces are
free of contamination as shown by the contrast in the lateral force
image.

A special cell was built for observations in liquid media.34 The cell was made from PTFE and moved in the x, y, and z directions
with respect to a stationary tip. The sample was fixed at the cell
bottom. The laser beam does not cross the air–liquid interface,
which is usually curved but enters and leaves the cell through a glass
plate.

Water used in the cell was triple distilled and then
passed through
a commercial Milli-Q system (Milli-Q Plus quality, resistivity ≈
15 MΩ·cm) containing ion-exchange and charcoal stages.
NaCl and KCl salts were obtained from Merck (PA 99.5%), and the stock
solutions were prepared with standard techniques in fresh, triple
distilled deionized Milli-Q water. The experiments were performed
at a temperature of 25 °C. Images were registered with various
scanning velocities and probing at least five different regions for
each sample. Silicon wafers ⟨100⟩ with a resistivity
of 10 Ω/cm from Virginia Semiconductor, Inc. (VA, USA) and before
use, ∼1 × 1 cm2 pieces were then etched in
a 50/50% HF solution for 15 min and then extensively rinsed with water.
