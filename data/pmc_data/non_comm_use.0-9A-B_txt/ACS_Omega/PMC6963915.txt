Four rhodamine 6G-based chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) are designed for selective detection
of Al3+ ion. They are characterized using various spectroscopic
techniques and X-ray crystallography. All absorption and emission
spectral studies have been performed in 10 mM N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer solution at
pH 7.4 in H2O/MeOH (9:1, v/v) at 25 °C. In absorption
spectra, chemosensors exhibit an intense band around 530 nm in the
presence of Al3+ ion. Chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) are nonfluorescent when excited around
490 nm. The presence of Al3+ ion enhances the emission
intensity (555 nm) many times. The formation of complexes 1–4 is established with the aid of different spectroscopic
techniques. The limit of detection value obtained in the nanomolar
range confirms the high sensitivity of the probes toward Al3+ ion. It has been observed that the presence of aliphatic spacers
in the diamine part and different halogen substituents in the salicylaldehyde
part strongly influences the selectivity of the chemosensors toward
Al3+ ion. The propensity of the chemosensors to identify
intracellular Al3+ ions in triple-negative human breast
cancer cell line MDA-MB-468 by fluorescence imaging is also examined
in this study.

Introduction
Metal ions play a crucial role in human
life and in the environment. Therefore, their detection is of immense
importance to biologists, chemists, and environmentalists.1 Scientists emerge in the development of new methodologies
for recognition of these cations.2−5 Design and synthesis of new chemosensors
for the selective detection of biologically and environmentally important
cations needs a special mention in this context.6,7

Aluminum is the highest abundant metal in the earth’s crust.8−10 Materials prepared from aluminum are widely used in our society.
They are used in food additives, textile industry, water treatment
plants, paper industry, production of light alloys, medicines (antacids),
cookware, etc. Aluminum toxicity causes Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s
diseases.11 Other Al- contaminated diseases
are amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, microcytic hypochromic anemia,
osteomalacia, and breast cancer.12−17 Preparation of chemosensors for the selective detection of Al3+ ion is a challenging task owing to its weak coordination
ability, strong hydration ability, and interferences from other trivalent
ions like Cr3+ and Fe3+. To date, a considerable
number of organic probes for Al3+ion18−23 have been synthesized, most of which suffer from some drawbacks
like insolubility in aqueous solution, synthetic procedures with multiple
steps, poor sensitivity and selectivity with target metal ions, etc.24−26 Al3+-sensing organic probes consist of important fluorophoric
units like rhodamine, anthraquinone, BODIPY, salicylaldehyde, fluorescein,
coumarin, etc.27−33 Rhodamine-based chemophores are colorless and nonfluorescent due
to the presence of spirolactam ring. The sensing mechanism is basically
opening of the spirolactam ring resulting in a strong emission. Low
pH or acidic condition also initiates opening of the spirolactam ring.
Therefore, selective choice of metal ion can initiate spirolactam
ring opening of rhodamine-based probes. A literature study reveals
that rhodamine-based probes can selectively detect various metal ions
like Al3+, Fe3+, Cr3+, Hg2+, Cu2+, etc.34−43 Some recently reported rhodamine-based important chemosensors are
collected in Chart S1 (Supporting Information). Chart S1 clearly shows that chemosensors reported
in the present work have certain advantages regarding the crystal
structure, real sample analysis, and cell imaging study in comparison
to previously reported data.44 Yang et
al.44a reported two rhodamine-pyrazole-based
both colorimetric and turn-on fluorescent chemosensors for dual detection
of Ni2+ and Al3+ ions in alcohol and aqueous
DMF medium. Jeong et al.44b synthesized
rhodamine-chloronicotinaldehyde-based “OFF–ON”
chemosensor for colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of Al3+ in acetonitrile medium. Chemate and co-workers have used
two rhodamine-based OFF–ON fluorescent chemosensors for dual
detection of Hg2+ and Al3+ in aqueous solution.44c Maity and co-workers prepared a rhodamine-1,2,3-triazole-based
chemosensor for dual detection of Al3+ and fluoride or
acetate ions in CH3OH–H2O (9:1) medium.44d The above examples did not report crystal structures
of the chemosensors and their biological cell imaging studies. In
this work, we have successfully elucidated crystal structures of all
four chemosensors and also performed their biological studies. In
an interesting work, Roy and co-workers synthesized a rhodamine-based
dual chemosensor for detection of Al3+ and Zn2+ ions in N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) buffer.44e Ghosh and co-workers have prepared a chemosensor using
the rhodamine unit for detection and discrimination of Al3+ and Hg2+ ions in HEPES buffer.44f Alam and co-workers synthesized a rhodamine-based trivalent fluorescent
sensor which can selectively detect Fe3+, Al3+, and Cr3+ ions in CH3OH–H2O (1:1).44g These works clearly show that
the chemosensors did not achieve their selectively toward Al3+ ions, whereas our synthesized chemosensors show selectivity only
toward Al3+ ions. Fu and co-workers44h synthesized a rhodamine 6G-containing fluorescent probe
for Al3+ion. Sahana et al. reported a rhodamine–pyrene
compound for selective colorimetric and fluorimetric detection of
Al3+ ion and living cell imaging study.44i In the above chemosensors, the lmit of detection (LOD)
values are observed in the micromolar range; interestingly, our reported
chemosensors give LOD values in the nanomolar range. Roy et al. reported
a rhodamine-based fluorescent chemosensor44j for selective detection of Al3+ ions in H2O/MeOH = 1: 9 (v/v) medium. Sen and co-workers also reported a rhodamine-based
Al3+-ion-sensing organic compound44k in EtOH–water, 1: 3 (v/v) medium. Sahana and group synthesized
a rhodamine-based fluorescent probe44l for
selective detection of Al3+ ions in EtOH–water,
4: 1 (v/v) medium. In all of these examples, medium is mainly organoaqueous,
whereas our Al3+-ions-sensing studies are performed in
MeOH–water, 1: 9 (v/v) medium.

In this work, we have
chosen hydrazine and 1,3 diaminopropane as amines, 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde
and 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde as aldehydes to prepare four different
rhodamine 6G-based chemosensors, H3L1, H3L2, H3L3, and H3L4, respectively.
All of the four chemosensors selectively detect Al3+ both
colorimetrically and fluorimetrically. The structure–property
relationship is established in this work. Variation of amines and
halogen substituents in the salicylaldehyde part controls the extent
of selectivity toward Al3+ ion. A significant variation
in different sensing parameters such as LOD, binding constant, and
naked eye detection of Al3+ ion is observed during this
study. These biocompatible chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) also exhibit cell permeability and sense intracellular
Al3+ ion present in breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-468
cells.

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization
N-(Rhodamine-6G)lactam-hydrazine
and N-(Rhodamine-6G)lactam-propylenediamine have
been synthesized according to a published procedure.45 The chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) are synthesized by the Schiff base condensation reaction
using rhodamine-6G-based amine and 3,5-dibromosalicylaldehyde or 3,5-dichlorosalicylaldehyde.
They are carefully characterized using different spectroscopy techniques
(UV–vis, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and NMR), and
the purity is verified with ESI-MS and C, H, N analysis (Figures S1–S5, Supporting Information).

H3L1–H3L4 react with Al(NO3)3·9H2O in a 1:1 ratio to produce
complexes 1–4 (Scheme 1). They are characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, FT-IR spectroscopy, C, H, N analysis,
and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis. The
experimentally obtained ESI-MS data are well matched with their simulated
result (Figures S6–S10, Supporting
Information). Detail data are presented in Experimental
Section.

Scheme 1 Route of Preparation of Chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) and Complexes 1–4
Crystal Structure Descriptions of Chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4)
We
have successfully developed X-ray-quality
crystals of H3L1, H3L2, and H3L3, H3L4, which are poorly diffracted. H3L1 and H3L2 are formed with a triclinic
crystal system with a P1̅ space group, whereas H3L3 and H3L4 crystals are developed in
the monoclinic system with a P21/c space group (Table S1). ORTEP
views of the chemosensors are shown in Figure 1 (H3L1–H3L4, respectively). Important bond distances and bond angles
are collected in Tables S2 and S3, respectively
(Supporting Information). The organic molecule is nonplanar, and it
confirms the Schiff base condensation reaction along with the presence
of a spirolactam ring and a xanthene unit within the molecule. The
C–O and C–N bond distances of the chemosensors vary
within the range of 1.217–1.381 and 1.274–1.441 Å,
respectively.

Figure 1 ORTEP view of the chemosensors (a) = H3L1, (b) = H3L2, (c) = H3L3, and (d) = H3L4. Atoms are shown as 30% thermal ellipsoids.
Here, H atoms are omitted for clarity.

NMR Studies
All of the chemosensors and Al3+–probe complexes give well-resolved 1H NMR spectra
in DMSO-d6 solvent. In H3L1, the phenolic OH and imine proton
appear as a sharp singlets at 11.56 and 8.90 ppm, respectively. Aromatic
protons appear in the region 7.94–6.20 ppm. Aliphatic amine
(−NH) protons appear as triplet at 5.11 ppm. Aliphatic CH2 protons appear as quartet at 3.13 ppm. Aromatic CH3 protons appear as singlet at 1.84 ppm, whereas aliphatic CH3 protons appear as triplet at 1.20 ppm (Figures S11–S14, Supporting Information).

In
complex 1, the phenolic −OH peak disappears due
to complexation and imine proton shifts to downfield and appears as
a sharp singlet at 9.30 ppm. We also observe significant changes in
the aromatic peak positions and broadening of the peaks due to complexation.
During complexation, one NH proton of the aliphatic part disappears
and the other appears as a broad peak at 5.11 ppm. Aliphatic CH2 protons merged with water molecules and appear as multiplet
at 3.50 ppm. Aromatic CH3 protons appear as singlet at
1.87 ppm, and aliphatic CH3 protons appear as triplet at
1.22 ppm (Figures S15–S18).

All of the chemosensors and probe-bound Al3+ complexes
give clean 13C NMR spectra in the DMSO-d6 solvent. In H3L1, spirolactam amide carbon appears at 165.58 and phenolic
carbon appears at 164.21 ppm. Imine carbon appears at 161.87 ppm.
Aromatic carbons are present in the region 151.88–96.32 ppm.
The carbon atom connecting the xanthene part and the spirolactam ring
is sp3-hybridized and appears at 66.24 ppm. Aromatic CH3 carbons appear with double intensity at 37.92 ppm. Aliphatic
CH2 and CH3 carbons appear with double intensity
at 17.44 and 14.59 ppm, respectively (Figures S19–S22, Supporting Information).

In complex 1, spirolactam amide carbon appears at 167.58, phenolic carbon
appears at 165.90 ppm, and imine carbon appears at 163.37 ppm. These
three pecks are shifted to downfield due to metal coordination. Aromatic
carbons appear within 151.88–96.32 ppm. Since metal coordination
results spirolactam ring opening, the sp3-hybridized carbon
atom connecting the xanthene part and the spirolactam ring now becomes
sp2-hybridized and appears at 134.90 ppm. Aromatic CH3 carbons appear with double intensity at 37.92 ppm. Aliphatic
CH2 and CH3 carbons appear with double intensity
at 17.44 and 14.59 ppm, respectively (Figures S23–S26, Supporting Information).

Absorption Spectral Analysis
The UV–vis spectra
of chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) are
first examined in 10 mM HEPES buffer solution at pH 7.4 (9:1, water/methanol,
v/v). Chemosensors H3L1 and H3L2 exhibit
well-resolved bands at ∼290 and ∼345 nm, whereas H3L3 and H3L4 show a well-defined band
at ∼420 nm. Peaks are represented as π → π*
and n → π* type of transitions. Interestingly, upon successive
addition of Al3+ ions (0–11 μM, 10 mM HEPES
buffer solution; pH 7.4; 9:1, water/methanol, v/v) to the chemosensor
(10 μM), a new peak appears at ∼530 nm with significant
changes in the spectra of all chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4). In H3L1 and H3L2, absorbance of peaks at ∼290 and ∼345 nm
gradually increase, whereas in H3L3 and H3L4, the absorbance of peak at ∼420 nm gradually decreases
(Figures 2 and S27–S29, Supporting Information). In the
presence of Al3+, spirolactam ring opening occurs, followed
by the coordination of the cation. Here, the Al3+ ion binds
with phenoxido oxygen, imine nitrogen, and amide oxygen of the chemosensor.
Spirolactam ring opening results reorientation of protons within the
aromatic ring and consequently removal of one primary amine proton.
Generation of a new peak at ∼530 nm in the presence of Al3+ ions also confirms structural rearrangement within the organic
molecule. The color of the solution turns fluorescent pinkish yellow.
Saturation has been observed in the presence of 1.1 equiv of Al3+ ions to the chemosensor. The 1:1 binding stoichiometry of
the chemosensors with Al3+ ions has been confirmed by Job’s
plot analysis (Figures S30–S33,
Supporting Information). These results have been further supported
by ESI-MS analysis. It is important to mention that the addition of
different cations (Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) did not change the initial
absorption spectrum of the chemosensor appreciably.

Figure 2 Absorption titration

μM) with gradual addition of Al3+, 0–11 μM
in 10 mM HEPES buffer at pH 7.4.

Fluorescence Properties Analysis
The experiment is
performed in 10 mM HEPES buffer at pH = 7.4 (9:1, water/methanol,
v/v) at ambient conditions. When excited at 345 nm, probes (10 μM)
are nonfluorescent. Upon successive addition of Al3+ ions
(0–11 μM) to the probe, an enormous fluorescence enhancement
is observed at 555 nm (Figures 3 and S34–S36, Supporting
Information). The fluorescence enhancement has a steady growth and
finally reaches a maximum at 1.1 equiv of Al3+ ions. In
fact, metal ions initiate opening of spirolactam ring followed by
a long conjugation of π-electronic system within the probe (Figure S37). Generation of a fluorescence peak
at 555 nm in the presence of Al3+ ions also proves the
above fact. Interestingly, the values of increment in emission spectra
is not equal for all of the probes. In the case of H3L1 and H3L2, the emission enhancement is 780- and
725-fold, whereas for H3L3 and H3L4, the enhancement is 425- and 391-fold.

in 10 mM HEPES buffer at pH = 7.4 by successive addition of Al3+ (0–11 μM) with λem = 555 nm
(1/1 slit).

The binding ability of the chemosensors toward
Al3+ ions has been calculated using the Benesi–Hildebrand
equation (eq 1) involving
fluorescence titration curve46 1  here, Fmax, F0, and Fx are fluorescence
intensities of chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4), in the presence of metal ions at saturation, free chemosensors
(H3L1–H3L4), and any intermediate
metal-ions concentration, respectively. K is denoted
as the binding constant of the complexes, and the concentration of
Al3+ ions is represented by C. The value
of binding constant (K) of the complexes has been
determined using the relation K = 1/slope. The binding
constant values are 8.00 × 105, 6.90 × 105, 1.37 × 104, and 1.03 × 104 M–1, respectively, for the chemosensors H3L1–H3L4 toward Al3+ ions
(Figures S38–S41, Supporting Information).
We have also performed fluorescence titrations of the chemosensors
in the presence of Al3+ ions in aprotic solvent such as
tetrahydrofuran (THF) to determine the binding constant in THF and
to compare the difference of binding constant values determined in
protic and aprotic solvents. The calculated binding constant values
in THF are close to the previously calculated values measured in the
HEPES buffer solution (9:1, water/methanol, v/v) (Table S4, Figures S38–S45, Supporting Information).
Therefore, we can conclude that free chemosensors H3L1–H3L4 do not undergo deprotonation in solution
(protic or aprotic). Al3+ ions can promote deprotonation
of H3L1–H3L4 in both aqueous
or nonaqueous solution.

The high selectivity of the chemosensors
toward Al3+ ions is again established by competition assay
experiment. Here, in the presence of chemosensor and Al3+ ions (1.0 equiv), different metal ions (Cd2+, Hg2+, Pb2+, Zn2+, Ag+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, and Ca2+) (Figures S46–S49, Supporting Information)
and common anions (S2O32–,
S2–, SO32–, HSO4–, SO42–, SCN–, N3–, OCN–, AsO43–, H2PO4–, HPO42–, PO43–, ClO4–,
AcO–, NO3–, F–, Cl–,PF6–, and P2O74–) are added in excess amount
(4.0 equiv) in 10 mM HEPES buffer solution at pH 7.4. Competition
assay experiments clearly express high-fluorescent recognition of
chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) for
Al3+ ions over most of the metal ions and all common anions.
It is important to mention that in the presence of Cr3+, Mg2+, Cu2+, and Fe3+ ions little
quenching in fluorescence intensity has been observed (Figures 4 and S50–S56, Supporting Information).

Figure 4 Relative fluorescence intensity diagram of [H3L1-Al3+]
system in the presence of different cations in 10 mM HEPES buffer
at pH 7.4. 1 = only H3L1 and (2–15) = H3L1 (10 μM) + Al3+ (10 μM) + Mn+ (40 μM), where Mn+ = (2—Ca2+, 3—Co2+, 4—Hg2+, 5—Zn2+, 6—Cr3+, 7—Mg2+, 8—Mn2+, 9—Na+, 10—Ni2+, 11—K+, 12—Pb2+, 13—Cu2+, 14—Fe3+, 15—Cd2+).

Interestingly, all of the chemosensors, H3L1–H3L4, also act as colorimetric probe
for selective detection of Al3+ ions. In the presence of
Al3+ ions, all of the probes exhibit fluorescent pinkish
yellow coloration, whereas they are almost colorless in the presence
of common ions. The intensity of the Al3+ chemosensor increases
in the order H3L1 > H3L2 > H3L3 > H3L4. Thus, the chemosensors
will be a good choice for selective colorimetric detection of Al3+ ions in both environmental and biological fields (Figures 5 and S57–S59, Supporting Information). We have
used saloon waste water and our laboratory tap water for real sample
analysis. Al3+ ions present in saloon waste water and laboratory
tap water are successfully detected by our chemosensors through the
naked eye and under UV lamp (Figure S60, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 Visual color changes of chemosensor H3L1 (10 μM) in the presence
of common metal ions (1 equiv) in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.4). The
images in the bottom row and top row were taken under visible light
and UV light, respectively, where 1 = only H3L1, 2–15 = H3L1 + different metal ions (Al3+, Cu2+, Cd2+, Pb2+, Hg2+, Mn2+, Fe3+, Co2+, Ni2+, K+, Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and Zn2+, respectively).

Reversibility and regeneration are two important
factors for real-time application of the chemosensor. This is tested
with the aid of sodium salt of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (Na2EDTA) solution. The fluorescent pinkish yellow color of the
probe–Al3+ complex disappears after addition of
1 equiv of Na2EDTA with a simultaneous decrease in fluorescence
intensity, which clearly indicates the regeneration of the free chemosensor.
Again, addition of Al3+ ions to the probe gives back fluorescent
pinkish yellow coloration. The whole cycle is repeated for at least
five times to establish reversibility and regeneration point (Figure S61, Supporting Information).

Limit
of detection (LOD) of the chemosensors toward Al3+ ions
is estimated using the 3σ method.47 The detection limits of the chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) for the Al3+ ions are 1.4 ×
10–9, 2.50 × 10–9, 0.40 ×
10–8, and 0.53 × 10–8 M,
respectively.

The effect of pH on chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) both in free condition and in
the presence of Al3+ ions is studied fluorimetrically.
It is well known that in acidic condition, the spirolactam ring of
the chemosensor opens. A similar observation is also noticed in the
presence of Al3+ ions. Therefore, both free chemosensor
and chemosensor −Al3+ adduct will exhibit high fluorescence
intensity at pH 2–4. At pH 5, a sharp decrease in the fluorescence
intensity of free chemosensor is observed. After pH 5–11, its
fluorescence intensity is very weak and remains unchanged. This observation
suggests reconstruction of spirolactam ring in neutral and basic conditions.
In the presence of Al3+ ions, the fluorescence intensity
of the chemosensor decreases slightly at pH 4 and then it maintains
a constant value up to pH 8. At pH 9, a sharp decrease in fluorescence
intensity of chemosensor is observed. After pH 9–11, a very
weak fluorescence intensity is observed. This is probably due to the
generation of Al(OH)3 and free chemosensor at higher pH.
Rest of the probes (H3L2–H3L4) and
probe–Al3+ adducts also followed a
similar trend in fluorescence intensity at different pH values (Figures 6 and S62–S64, Supporting Information). The
pH experiments show that these chemosensors can act as a selective
fluorescent probe to recognize Al3+ ions in the presence
of other metal ions in a biological system under physiological condition.

Lifetime and Quantum Yield Study
Lifetime measurements
for the chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) and complexes 1–4 are studied
at 25 °C in 10 mM HEPES buffer (pH = 7.4) medium. The average
values of fluorescence decay lifetime of the chemosensors and complexes 1–4 have been measured using the given
formula (τf = a1τ1 + a2τ2, where
a1 and a2 are the relative amplitudes of the decay process). The average values
of fluorescence lifetime of the chemosensors (H3L1−H3L4) and complexes 1−4 are
3.95, 2.56, 1.58, 1.06 ns and 6.8, 4.58, 4.53, 4.38 ns, respectively
(Figures S69−S72 and Table S5, Supporting
Information).

The fluorescence quantum yield (Φ) has been
calculated as follows 2  In the above equation (eq 2), A is the area under the emission spectral curve, OD is the optical
density of the compound at the excitation wavelength, and η
is the refractive index of the solvent. The Φstandard value is taken as 0.52 (for quinine sulfate).

The values of
Φ for H3L1–H3L4 and
probe–Al3+ complexes 1–4 are estimated to be 0.004, 0.003, 0.002, 0.004 and 0.24,
0.18, 0.13, 0.11, respectively (Table S5).

Mechanism of Fluorescence Intensity Enhancement in Chemosensors
in the Order H3L1 > H3L2 > H3L3 > H3L4 in the Presence of Al3+ Ions
In this work, the sensing behavior of four rhodamine 6G-based chemosensors
toward Al3+ ions is explored. The fluorescence intensity
of the chemosensors increases abruptly in the presence of Al3+ ions due to opening of the spirolactam ring (Scheme 1). This mechanistic process has been supported
by spectroscopic techniques such as 1H, 13C
NMR, and FT-IR spectroscopy.31,34,36−38,40 In the presence of
Al3+ ions, appreciable changes are observed in their 1H NMR spectrum of free chemosensors. The presence of Al3+ ion initiates spirolactam ring opening followed by rearrangement
of double bonds. This results in the disappearance of one aliphatic
amine (−NH) proton. The disappearance of phenolic −OH
peak and downfield shift of imine proton (9.30 ppm) establishes coordination
of phenoxido oxygen and imine nitrogen atom with the metal center.
Changes in the spectral pattern of both aromatic and aliphatic protons
are also observed after addition of Al3+. In free chemosensor,
the carbon atom connecting the xanthene part and the spirolactam ring
is sp3-hybridized, and it appears at 66.24 ppm. Interestingly,
during metal coordination, spirolactam ring opens, and as a result,
the sp3-hybridized carbon atom becomes sp2-hybridized
and appears at 134.90 ppm (Figures S23–S26). Free chemosensors exhibit FT-IR stretching frequency of amide
“C=O” bond and imine bond at ∼1699 and
∼1674 cm–1, respectively, which are shifted
significantly to lower values and appear at ∼1663 and ∼1646
cm–1, respectively, after complexation. The sharp
−OH peak at 3408 cm–1 also disappears after
complexation. This observation suggests Al3+-ion coordination
with phenoxido oxygen, amide oxygen, and imine nitrogen of the chemosensor.
Therefore, FT-IR data also supports spirolactam ring opening in the
presence of Al3+ ion.

All chemosensors are colorless
and nonfluorescent in visible light. The presence of Al3+ ions initiates opening of the spirolactam ring and the color becomes
intense, pinkish yellow. The intensity of color is not similar. In
the presence of Al3+ ions, the intensity increases in the
order H3L1 > H3L2 > H3L3 > H3L4. Again, H3L1, H3L2, H3L3, and H3L4 exhibit
around 780, 725, 425, and 391 times increase of fluorescence intensity
in the presence of Al3+ ions, respectively. The LOD values
are 1.4 × 10–9, 2.50 × 10–9, 0.40 × 10–8, and 0.53 × 10–8 M, respectively. The values of binding constant of the probes toward
Al3+ ions are 8.00 × 105, 6.90 × 105, 1.37 × 104, and 1.03 × 104 M–1, respectively. Here, enhancement in the fluorescence
intensity of the chemosensors in the presence of Al3+ ions
and binding constant values of the probes toward Al3+ ions
follow the same order H3L1 > H3L2 > H3L3 > H3L4. All these facts
can be well explained by considering two factors: influence of ring
strain during interaction between chemosensors and Al3+ ions and electron-withdrawing effect (−I effect) of the halogen
substituent present in the chemosensors. Interestingly, the first
effect is more pronounced. H3L1 and H3L2 form more stable five-membered chelate rings with Al3+ ions, whereas H3L3 and H3L4 form eight-membered chelate rings in the presence of Al3+ ions (Figure S37). Also, in the presence
of a bromo substituent, the coordination ability of the imine nitrogen
and phenoxido oxygen of the respective chemosensor is relatively high
in comparison with a chloro substituent due to the −I effect.
Therefore, due to the formation of the most stable H3L1–Al3+ complex,
the intensity of the complex solution under visible light is maximum,
binding constant is the highest and LOD value is the lowest among
four chemosensors.

Biocompatibility Study of the Ligands
The cellular
toxicities of the ligands (H3L1, H3L2, H3L3, and H3L4) are envisaged to
determine the compatibility against the normal human lung fibroblast
cells, WI-38. The cells are exposed with various concentrations (20–100
μM/mL) of the ligands. Then, the cells are incubated for 24
h and the cellular survivability is determined with the help of the
MTT assay. From the results, no significant toxicity is observed even
at enhanced concentrations of 100 μM (as seen in Figure S69, Supporting Information). Hence, the
results clearly depict the biocompatibility of the ligands and also
suggest that these ligands have the potential to emerge as promising
tools for application in biomedical fields.

Cell Imaging
The cellular internalization of the chemosensors
(H3L1–H3L4) (10 μM) and
Al3+salt (10 μM) has been determined
with the aid of detailed fluorescence microscopy studies. The fluorescence
microscopy images reveal the presence of a promiscuous red fluorescent
signal in the microscope (Figure 7). Henceforth, the results suggest that the ligands
and the Al3+ salts are promptly internalized by the cells,
which in turn are responsible for the emergence of red fluorescent
signal.

MDA-MB-468 (control) cells in the presence of chemosensor (H3L1–H3L4) (10 μM) + Al3+ (10 μM).

Density Functional Theory (DFT) Study
DFT and time-dependent
DFT (TDDFT) studies are performed to establish the structural and
electronic parameters of probes. Furthermore, to understand the nature,
origin, and contribution of M.O.s for electronic transitions, a TDDFT
study was performed. This study gives an idea of the quantity of energy
associated with every individual transition. In each individual M.O.,
the contribution from both chemosensor and metal center has been computed.
Therefore, DFT and TDDFT analyses play an important role to support
and understand structural and electronic parameters of complexes.

Here, the geometry optimization of the chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) has been performed using the
DFT/B3LYP process. Some important bond distances and bond angles of
all of the chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) are listed in Tables S2 and S3. Energies
(eV) of some selected M.O.s are included in Table S6. Contour plots of some selected molecular orbital of the
chemosensors are depicted in Figure S70. Theoretical calculations reveal that in H3L1, electron density in lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) is mainly distributed over the xanthene part
and electron density in highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
is mainly distributed over the xanthene part and spirolactam ring.
In H3L2, the electron
density in LUMO is mainly distributed over the salicyl part and the
spirolactam ring adjacent aromatic moiety and the electron density
in HOMO is mainly distributed over the xanthene part. LUMOs of both H3L3 and H3L4 are mainly salicyl part-based,
whereas HOMOs are mainly xanthene moiety-based.

TDDFT Study
Electronic transitions in chemosensors
(H3L1–H3L4) are theoretically
studied using the TDDFT, B3LYP/CPCM method. Important electronic transitions
are given in Table S7. In theoretical calculations,
for H3L1 and H3L2, intense absorption
bands are found at around 355 and 345 nm, respectively. Major transitions
for H3L1 are HOMO
– 2 → LUMO (88%) and HOMO – 1 → LUMO (74%)
(Figure 8), whereas
for H3L2, the key
transitions are HOMO – 2 → LUMO (99%) and HOMO –
3 → LUMO (96%), respectively (Figure S71). In the case of H3L3 and H3L4, two
major bands are observed at around 420 and 400 nm, which correspond
to the HOMO → LUMO (96%) and HOMO – 1 → LUMO
(95%) (H3L3) (Figure S72) and HOMO → LUMO (97%) and
HOMO – 1 → LUMO (96%) (H3L4) (Figure S73).

Summary
We have successfully developed four new rhodamine
6G-based fluorescent and colorimetric chemosensors H3L1–H3L4 for a rapid and selective detection
of Al3+ ions. For visualization by the naked eye, the intensity
of the color of probe–Al3+ ions increases in the
order HL4-Al3+ < HL3–Al3+ < HL2-Al3+ < HL1-Al3+.
All four chemosensors form a 1:1 complex with Al3+ ions,
which has been proved by fluorescence measurements, ESI-MS analysis,
and NMR studies. In fluorescence competition assay experiments, the
selectivity of the probes toward Al3+ ions is established.
Moreover, the reversibility is also achieved by addition of Na2EDTA solution. H3L1, H3L2, H3L3, and H3L4 exhibit around 780,
725, 425, and 391 times enhancement in fluorescence intensity in the
presence of Al3+ ions. Al3+ is detected in the
nanomolar scale, and the LOD values are 1.4 × 10–9, 2.50 × 10–9, 0.40 × 10–8, and 0.53 × 10–8 M, respectively. All of
the probes are suitable for real-time quantitative detection of Al3+ ions in the field of environmental samples and biological
systems. The values of binding constant of the probes toward Al3+ ions are 8.00 × 105, 6.90 × 105, 1.37 × 104, and 1.03 × 104 M–1, respectively. In this work, we have also
established the influence of ring strain and electron-withdrawing
effect (−I effect) of the halogen substituents present in the
chemosensors during interaction between chemosensors and Al3+ ions. Interestingly, the first effect is more pronounced compare
to the other. The color intensity difference of the probes in the
presence of Al3+ ions under visible light, different binding
constants, quantum yields, and LOD values of the probes toward Al3+ ions can be well explained in the light of the above two
factors. H3L1 and H3L2 form more stable
five-membered chelate ring with Al3+ ions, whereas H3L3 and H3L4 form an eight-membered chelate
ring in the presence of Al3+ ions (Figure S37). Also, in the presence of bromo substituent, the
coordination ability of the imine nitrogen and phenoxido oxygen of
the respective chemosensor is relatively high in comparison to chloro
substituent due to less −I effect. We are also successful in
revealing its practical application by performing cell imaging study
of chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) using
MDA-MB-468 cells. Furthermore, the probes are applied to detect intracellular
Al3+ ions in live cells with no significant cytotoxicity.
We have compared different factors like elucidation of crystal structure
of the chemosensors, solubility of chemosensors in the aqueous medium
for biological and real sample analyses, selectivity of the chemosensors
toward Al3+ ions, and the nanomolar range of LOD values
between chemosensors reported in this work and previously reported
results. Interestingly, our chemosensors have successfully covered
all of the points mentioned above in comparison to previously reported
results presented in Chart S1.

Experimental Section
Materials and Physical Measurements Description
All
reagent- or analytical-grade chemicals and solvents were collected
from commercial sources and used without further purification. Elemental
analysis was carried out using a PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer.
Infrared spectra (400–4000 cm–1) were recorded
using KBr pellets on a Nicolet Magna IR 750 series-II FT-IR spectrophotometer.
Absorption spectral data were collected using a Cary 60 spectrophotometer
(Agilent) with a 1 cm path length quartz cell. Electron spray ionization
mass (ESI-MS positive) spectra were noted using a MICROMASS Q-TOF
mass spectrometer. A Fluromax-4 spectrofluorimeter was used to collect
emission spectral data at room temperature (298 K) in HEPES buffer
at pH = 7.4 solution under degassed condition. A time-resolved spectrofluorometer
from IBH, U.K., was used to collect the fluorescence lifetime data, 1H and 13C NMR spectral data were collected using
Bruker 400 and 300 spectrometers in DMSO-d6 solvent.

X-ray Crystallography
Single-crystal X-ray data of
chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) were
collected on a Bruker SMART APEX-II CCD diffractometer with the aid
of graphite monochromated Mo Kα radiation (λ = 0.71073
Å) at room temperature. Data processing, structure solution,
and refinement were examined using the Bruker Apex-II suite program.
All available reflections data in the 2θmax range
were harvested and corrected for Lorentz and polarization factors
with Bruker SAINT plus.48 Reflections were
then corrected for absorption, interframe scaling, and different systematic
errors with SADABS.49 The structures were
solved by the direct methods and refined with the help of a full-matrix
least-squares technique based on F2 with
SHELX-2017/1 software package.50 All of
the nonhydrogen atoms were refined with anisotropic thermal parameters.
C–H hydrogen atoms were attached at geometrical positions with Uiso = 1/2Ueq to
those they are attached. Crystal data and details of data collection
and refinement for H3L1–H3L4 are
collected in Table S1.

UV–Visible and Fluorescence Spectroscopy Experiment
Stock solutions of different ions (1 × 10–3 M) were prepared in a deionized water medium. A stock solution of
the chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) (1
× 10–3 M) was prepared in methanol medium.
The chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) solution
was then diluted to 1 × 10–5 M as per requirement.
A competitive assay of various cations and anions and other spectroscopic
experiments were performed in aqueous methanolic HEPES buffer (10
mM) medium at pH 7.4. In the competitive assay experiments, the test
samples were prepared by mixing appropriate amounts of the cations
stock in 3 mL of chemosensors (H3L1–H3L4) solution (1 × 10–5 M).

Binding Stoichiometry (Job’s Plot) Studies
Binding
stoichiometry of the chemosensors with that of Al3+ ions
is determined by Job’s continuation method using absorption
spectroscopy. At 25 °C, the absorbance was recorded for solutions
where the concentrations of both chemosensor and Al3+ ions
are varied but the sum of their concentrations was kept constant at
1 × 10–5 M, i.e., relative change in absorbance
(ΔA/A0) against
mole fraction of chemosensor. The break point in the resulting plot
represents the mole fraction of chemosensor in the Al3+ complex. From the break point, the stoichiometry was determined.
The final results reported were an average of at least three experiments.

Cell Culture
The triple-negative breast cancer cells
of human origin, MDA-MB-468, are procured from the National Center
for Cell Science (NCCS) Pune, India. The cells were cultured in an
enriched cell culture medium, Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and
a mixture of appropriate antibiotics (streptomycin and penicillin
at a dose of 100 units/mL). The cells were incubated at a temperature of 37 °C and in the prevalence of 5% CO2.

Cell Visualization Studies
The human breast cancer
cells, MDA-MB-468, were cultured on coverslips for a period of 24
h. Then, these cells were either left untreated or were exposed to a dose of ligands (10 μM) and Al3+ salt
(10 μM). These treated cells were then incubated for 24 h at
a temperature of 37 °C. Afterward, the cells were thoroughly
washed with the help of 1 × PBS. Ultimately, the cells were envisaged
with the help of a fluorescence microscope (Leica) following the mounting
of the cells on a glass slide.

Computational Method
All computations were studied
using the GAUSSIAN09 (G09)51 software package.
For optimization process, we used the density functional theory method
at the B3LYP level,52,53 and the standard 6-31+G(d) basis
set for C, H, N, and O atoms54,55 and the lanL2DZ effective
potential (ECP) set of Hay and Wadt56−58 for aluminum atoms have
been selected for optimization.

TDDFT calculation was studied
with the optimized geometry to ensure only positive eigen values.
Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)59−61 was examined
using conductor-like polarizable continuum model (CPCM)62−64 and the same B3LYP level and basis sets in methanolic solvent system.
GAUSSSUM65 was utilized to calculate the
fractional contributions of various groups to each molecular orbital.
