Ordered self-assemblies of hybrid
molecules have potential as protective
umbrellas against environmental pollution and corrosion. This article
describes the design and fabrication of a new self-cleaning hybrid
molecular material containing polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane
(POSS) and diphenylalanine as hydrophobic and pollution-protective
coating. The colorless organic–inorganic hybrid materials,
in which the diphenylalanine motif controls the self-assembly, exhibit
unique water resistance property and enhance mechanical strength of
paper 1.5-fold. The hybrid building blocks self-assemble in antiparallel
sheet manner through noncovalent interactions to form a supramolecular
layerlike surface with enhanced roughness. The hybrid material is
soluble in organic solvents at room temperature that makes it easy
to coat on paper, wood, or metal surfaces. The coating is effective
against rusting, corrosion, environmental pollution, and bacterial
attack. The coating has been used as fire retardant and enhances fire
safety. The sustainable molecular material is promising for the packaging
industry and metal industry and artifact preservation.

Introduction
Organic–inorganic
hybrid materials1 have recently attracted
interest for their potential applications
and high performance in molecular machines,2 sensors,3 catalysts,4 energy and optoelectronic devices.5 These hybrid materials exhibit both the properties of organic and
inorganic materials and even novel characteristics that are not found
in the parent compounds. Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes (POSS)
are organic–inorganic hybrid materials with the formula (RSiO1.5)n (n = 6,
8, 10, 12) and have nanometer-sized inorganic cores surrounded by
organic functional groups.6−11 A POSS molecule with a unique cubic cagelike nanostructure has novel
properties like high thermal and mechanical stability, flame retardancy,
and low dielectric constant.12−14 POSS-based materials have a wide
range of applications, including opticals,15 electronics,16 antimicrobial agents,17 and catalysis.18−22 Coughlin et al. have reported on the crystal structure
and morphology of POSS nanoparticles.23 De and co-workers have reported on a polymer matrix incorporating
the POSS–peptide conjugate.24 Xu
et al. have synthesized tetraphenylethene-modified POSS.25 However, the peptide–POSS hybrid for
tuning the structural and functional properties and sustainability
is rare.26

By precisely organizing
the simple molecular building blocks by
noncovalent interactions, nature has achieved complex materials with
diverse structures and functions. Peptide motifs have structural and
functional versatilities to form diverse supramolecular nanostructures.27−30 The peptides, like diphenylalanine, have been used to fabricate
supramolecular materials, with significant physical and chemical stability31 and unique mechanical,32 electrical,33,34 and optical35−37 properties.
Gazit et al. have used the diphenylalanine nanotube as a template
to cast silver nanowire.38 Herein, we have
synthesized a hybrid molecule containing l-phenylalanine
and POSS (Figure 1).
Our goal was to couple diphenylalanine and POSS to fabricate a green
and sustainable organic–inorganic hybrid material and create
a self-assembled engineered structure of POSS and develop user-friendly
coating material with stability, hardness, and thermo compatibility.
In this context, the folding and interactions of the hydrophobic groups
will be interesting.

Results and Discussion
The target compound was synthesized
by conventional solution-phase
methods and purified and well characterized by 1H NMR, 13C NMR, 29Si NMR, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR),
and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. A detailed description of the
synthesis and characterization of hybrid compound 1 is
given in the Supporting Information. Briefly,
tBoc-protected diphenylalanine 2 was coupled with POSS
amine 3 using a standard coupling reagent dicyclohexyl
carbodiimide (DCC) to obtain 1 in good yield. The signals
at δ values of 7.28 and 7.05 in its 1H NMR spectrum
are assigned to the aromatic protons of diphenylalanine. The signals
at δ 3.05, 2.80, and 1.85 in its 1H NMR spectrum
are assigned to CαH, CγH, and CβH of POSS, respectively, suggesting that the diphenylalanine
group was connected to the POSS moiety. The signals at δ values
of −68.52 and −68.74 in the 29Si NMR (99
MHz, CDCl3) spectrum and the signal at m/z 1291.51 in the ESI-mass spectra further confirmed
the formation of POSS-appended diphenylalanine.

The presence
of both nonpolar and polar functionalities in 1 increases
solubility in a wide range of organic solvents,
with diverse polarity indexes, and allows for self-association. Initially,
the self-assembly of the hybrid peptide 1 has been studied
using different spectroscopic techniques. The POSS-containing peptide 1 in DCM solution exhibits absorption bands at 228, 259, and
288 nm due to the characteristic n−π* and π–π*
transitions. The intensity of the band increases with the gradual
increase in the concentration of peptide 1 (Figure S1 of the Supporting Information). The
emission spectrum of peptide 1 in DCM solution shows
that with increasing concentration the band at 365 nm for the aromatic
ring is increasing and the 450 nm band responsible for molecular stacking
is decreasing (Figure 2a). FT-IR spectroscopy is an excellent technique to investigate the
secondary structure and self-assembly pattern of the peptide. For
peptide 1, the FT-IR band observed around 3332 cm–1 is responsible for hydrogen-bonded NH. However, the
band at 3435 cm–1 indicates that all NH groups are
not involved in intermolecular hydrogen bonding (Figure 2b).39 By POSS modification, the amide I band appeared at 1641 cm–1. For peptide 1, there is an intense band around 1114 cm–1, characteristic
of Si–O–Si linkage.40 The
band at 1693 cm–1 confirms the antiparallel sheetlike
structure (Figure 2b inset). The powder X-ray diffraction of peptide 1 indicates
a crystalline structure and shows multiple diffractions at 2θ
= 3.84, 4.61, 6.15, 7.69, 9.23, 9.99, 11.53, 16.92, 17.69, 19.23,
and 20.76° (Figure S2). The strongest
scattering peak at 3.94° (2θ) corresponds to a second-order
diffraction and an antiparallel structure.25 To investigate the role of different molecular functionalities in 1, we also studied the self-assembly of the building block 2 by different spectroscopic techniques (Figure S3). To investigate whether the hydrogen bonding is
intramolecular or intermolecular, an NMR solvent titration experiment
has been performed. To the solution of peptide 1 in CDCl3, DMSO-d6 was gradually added
in 10 μL amount at room temperature and NMR spectra were recorded.
From Figure 3a, upon
gradual addition of DMSO-d6, a hydrogen
bond-accepting solvent, to the CDCl3 solution of peptide 1, the NH protons of peptide 1 get exposed to
DMSO-d6 and shift toward the downfield
regions. For peptide 1, Boc NH and Phe(2) NH exhibit
minimum chemical shifts (Δδ 0.40) even at higher percentages
of (CD3)2SO. However, POSS NH shows the maximum
chemical shift (Δδ 0.50). This result indicates that the
peptide 1 forms an intermolecular hydrogen-bonded structure.41,42 The aggregation propensities of the reported peptides were further
studied by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The CD spectra of
peptide 1 recorded from dilute methanol solution (1 ×
10–6 M) shows positive bands appearing at 202 and
209 nm and the negative cotton effect at 204 and 213 nm (Figure 3b). This indicates
an antiparallel sheetlike structure for peptide 1.

To investigate the effect of POSS
on the morphology of the peptides,
field emission scanning electron microscopic (FE-SEM) measurements
were performed. The presence of POSS can dramatically affect the self-assembly
and morphology due to their large volume and high steric hindrance.
The DCM solution of the peptide was drop-casted on a clean glass slide
and allowed to evaporate the solvent at room temperature for 12 h
and dried under vacuum for 2 days. The FE-SEM images of peptide 1 show the formation of polydisperse microspheres-like morphology
(Figure 4a,b). The
average diameter of the microspheres is ca. 0.8 μm. The analysis
of the FE-SEM images shows that the alignment and deposition of the
microshperes cause enhancement of the surface roughness. Liu and co-workers
have reported that the POSS self-assemble into a polydisperse layer
structure by direct polymerization of multifunctional POSS-appended
methylmethacrylate in the presence of benzoyl peroxide.43 To investigate the role of different molecular
functionalities in 1 on morphologies, we also studied
the self-assembly of the building blocks 2 and 3 (Figure 4c,d). tBoc-protected diphenylalanine 2 was moderately
soluble in dichloromethane and the morphology appeared hexagonal nanotube
in nature (Figure 4c). However, the dichloromethane solution of POSS 3 resulted
in a nanocube-like structure (Figure 4d).

Figure 4 (a) FE-SEM image of peptide 1 showing polydisperse
microspheres-like morphology with an enhanced surface. (b) The microspheres-like
morphology of peptide 1 showing no pores in the microspheres.
(c) FE-SEM images of peptide 2 showing nanotube-like
structures. Inset shows the nanotubes as hexagonal in shape. (d) FE-SEM
images of POSS 3 showing nanocube-like morphology. Inset
shows that the nanocubes are hollow in nature.

The enhanced surface roughness is a natural phenomenon used
to
control the water wettability of surfaces, such as lotus leaves. POSS
is a well-defined cluster, with an inorganic core (Si8O12), surrounded by eight organic groups and finds a widespread
use in water-repellent coating. The diphenylalanine is also hydrophobic
in nature. Overall, the hydrophobicity as well as the surface roughness
(nanotexturation) of the self-assembled peptide 1 increases.
So, the wettability of the peptide 1-coated surfaces
should decrease. Indeed, the contact angle of a water droplet on the
peptide 1-coated paper surface increases from 62°
(without coating) to 113° (Figure S4). Thus, simply by coating with peptide 1, the surface
wettability of paper could be turned from hydrophilic to strongly
hydrophobic. To illustrate the wettability decrease and shape retention,
a folded paper without coating and a folded paper coated with peptide 1 were compared.44 The folded paper
without coating could not unfold when it was folded and drenched with
water (Figure 5a).
However, under the same condition, the peptide 1-coated
paper (0.012 mm) unfolds and recovers its original shape (Figure 5b). The morphology
of the papers was studied by FE-SEM. As expected, the original paper
exhibits a ribbonlike structure, in which individual fibers can be
identified (Figure 5c). However, for peptide 1-coated paper, it is difficult
to distinguish individual fibers and peptide 1 microspheres
cover the paper surface with enhanced surface roughness (Figure 5d). Recently, Chung
and co-workers have reported that POSS can be used to strengthen the
mechanical properties of bioinspired adhesive.45Figure 5e,f shows the results of mechanical property experiments. The coating
with peptide 1 increases the load capacity of the paper
1.5-fold (Figure 5e).
Compared to that of the original uncoated paper, the elongation of
the coated papers at the break increases 2-fold. The stress–strain
curves of peptide 1-coated paper also show the decrease
in the elastic modulus to 562 from 712 MPa of the uncoated paper (Figure 5f). As a result,
the peptide 1-coated paper not only increases the strength
greatly but also the strain of the fibers, which improves the mechanical
performance of the composites. The strength of a paper is due to the
hydrogen-bonded network among overlapping cellulose fibers. When the
paper has been coated with peptide 1, the original hydrogen-bonded
network of cellulose could be partially broken and replaced by the
formation of new hydrogen bonds between peptide 1 and
the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Peptide 1 can also
act as a binder among the cellulose fibers and significantly increase
the strength and stability of paper. So, when the paper has been wetted
with water, it shows excellent flexibility and shape retention.

curves of normal paper (black) and peptide 1-coated paper

To further investigate the topology
of the hybrid material coating
on paper, atomic force microscopic (AFM) studies were performed. The
peptide solutions in dichloromethane (1 mM) were dropcast on a paper,
dried and investigated by AFM. The AFM image of the coated paper shows
the formation of polydisperse microspheres morphology over the paper
surface (Figure 6a).
The three-dimensional (3D) image of coated paper surface indicates
that the paper surface becomes very rough and the coating is very
heterogeneous (Figure 6b). Figure 6c shows
the surface of a noncoated paper.

microspheres-like morphology on the paper surface. (b) The 3D image
shows that the surface of peptide 1-coated paper is very
rough. (c) The 3D image of a paper surface without peptide 1 coating.

Interestingly, the coated paper
shows resistance toward bacterial
growth. Figure 7a shows
the growth of Escherichia coli on the
paper surface under aqueous media. Under the same condition, the peptide 1-coated paper inhibits the growth of E. coli on the paper surface for up to 10 days (Figure 7b). Figure S15 shows the growth of E. coli on the
POSS 3-coated paper surface (0.013 mm) under aqueous
media. This indicates that the peptide 1-coated paper
is promising as an antibacterial water-resistant packing material.

(the shiny white spots) on the paper surface. (b) Peptide 1-coated paper inhibits the growth of E. coli.

Furthermore, we have coated the
iron surface with peptide 1. The same sample of noncoated
iron nails got rusted by treatment
with water under laboratory atmosphere. However, the iron nails coated
with peptide 1 (0.014 mm) have no rust under the same
condition. Then, we have coated half portion of an iron nail. The
peptide 1 does not react with iron, and the coated part
exhibits no color change (Figure 8a). Figure 8b shows the deposition of rust on the noncoated part of the
iron nail due to treatment with water for 12 h. Hence, peptide 1 acts as an antirusting and anticorrosion material. We have
performed FE-SEM studies of the peptide 1-coated iron
nail surface (Figure S5). We have also
tested the antipollution properties of the peptide 1 coating.
Environmental pollution is very harmful for artifacts. However, the
protective coating that has color, acidity, basicity, or forms a thick
layer can deform the artifact. So, an efficient, neutral, and thin
layer of protective coating material is highly important for artifact
preservation. We have coated half portion of a silver artifact by
peptide 1. There is no color change or morphological
change by coating with peptide 1 (Figure 8c). This indicates that silver does not react
with peptide 1. Figure 8d shows the formation of black color silver sulfide
on the noncoated part of the artifact surface after treatment with
hydrogen sulfide for 1 min.

coating is colorless and not visible with the naked eye. (b) The same
iron nail after overnight treatment with water, showing rust on the
noncoated portion. However, the coating with compound 1 prevents rust and corrosion. (c) A silver artifact partially coated
with compound 1. (d) The silver artifact after contact
with hydrogen sulfide. The compound 1-coated area is
protected from hydrogen sulfide pollution.

We have also tested the resistance of the deposit to weathering.
For that, we have coated a part of the iron nail surfaces by peptide 1. Then, we have treated the iron nails with an aqueous solution
of NaCl, KCl, NaBr, KBr, and HCl. Figure 9 shows the deposition of rust on the noncoated
part of the iron nails. However, the parts of the iron nails coated
with peptide 1 have no change under weathering. Even
at pH 2, in HCl solution, the peptide 1-coated part exhibits
no color change or corrosion.

Figure 9 Iron nails partially coated with peptide 1 exhibit
resistance to weathering from like NaCl, KCl, KBr, NaBr, and HCl at
pH 2.

The POSS molecule is known to
have some fire-retardant property
because during burning the Si–C bonds get cleaved and form
stable silicon-oxycarbide black glass surface on the materials.46 The thermogravimetric analysis plots show that
the thermal stabilization of peptide 1 is higher than
that of peptide 2 and POSS 3 (Figure S21). The POSS moiety has a significantly
low melting point and it melts at near to 56 °C (Figure 10a) and comes out from the
surface of the materials and thus the fire retardancy effectively
decreases. However, the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiments
show that the POSS-appended peptide 1 has significant
thermal stability. Peptide 1 exhibits no decomposition,
phase transition, or mass loss for up to 130 °C (Figure 10a). Fire-resistant coating
has been extensively studied for fire-retardant applications at high
temperatures and extended times. The coating should have relatively
good thermal stability as well as processibility and be a true fire
barrier for a wide variety of materials, including wood. We have performed
the fire retardation experiments with highly flammable match sticks.
The experimental strategy was to test whether the POSS-appended peptide 1 can stop the spreading fire. So, we have coated the tail
of the match stick with peptide 1 (Figure 10b). Similarly, the other sets
of match sticks were coated with only POSS 3 and peptide 2 in the DCM solution. The match stick without coating burnt
completely (Figure 10c). For peptide 1, during the experiments we have seen
that in the beginning fire catches the head of the sticks and it spreads
to the tail of the sticks (Figure 10c). Initially, the flame smoothly covers the uncoated
portion of the stick and as soon as the flame reaches the coated portion
it gets retarded instantly, and after a few seconds the flames extinguis
suddenly, leaving the peptide 1-coated portion (0.030
mm) of the stick unburned (Figure 10c). There is no additional smoke or bad smell. But
for the POSS 3-coated stick (0.031 mm) in an identical
condition, the flame takes significantly more time to reach the tail
of the stick; the fire does not get extinguished (Figure 10c). However, for the sticks
coated with peptide 2 (0.031 mm), the whole stick burnt
quickly (Figure 10c). So, the coating of only POSS 3 retards the flame
whereas POSS-appended peptide 1 not only retards the
flame but also extinguishes the fire.

POSS (red) and peptide 1 (black).

experiment of match sticks with or without coating, coated with peptide 2, POSS 3, and peptide 1, at different

Conclusions
In
conclusion, we report a novel multifunctional self-cleaning
organic–inorganic hybrid material from diphenylalanine and
POSS. The incorporation of POSS increases hardness, stability, and
thermo compatibility of the hybrid material and the diphenylalanine-directed
aggregation propensities. Peptide 1 forms an antiparallel
structure and exhibits polydisperse microspheres morphology. The deposition
of the microspheres on any surface enhances its roughness and hydrophobicity.
The POSS-appended peptide-coated paper exhibits unique water resistance
property and elasticity and enhances mechanical strength and inhibits
bacterial colony growth. Moreover, the colorless hydrophobic coating
of the hybrid material prevents rusting of iron and decreases corrosion.
The coated match stick experiments have shown that POSS-appended diphenylalanine
not only retards the flame but also extinguishes the fire. These findings
show that the self-cleaning hybrid materials, with their novel properties,
are promising for the packaging industry and metal industry and protect
artifacts from corrosion and environmental pollution.

Synthesis
The reported peptide was synthesized by the
conventional solution-phase methodology using racemization-free fragment
condensation strategy. The tertiary butoxycarbonyl group was used
for N-terminal protection, and the C-terminus was protected as a methyl
ester. Couplings were mediated by DCC/1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt).
The products were purified by column chromatography using silica (100–200-mesh
size) gel as the stationary phase and n-hexane–ethyl
acetate mixture as the eluent. The final compound was fully characterized
by 500 MHz 1H NMR spectroscopy, 13C NMR spectroscopy,
MS, and IR spectroscopy.

off. The organic layer was washed with 2 M HCl (3 × 50 mL), brine
(2 × 50 mL), 1 M sodium carbonate (3 × 50 mL), and brine
(2 × 50 mL) and dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate. The solution

All NMR studies were carried out on
a Brüker AVANCE 500 MHz spectrometer. Compound concentrations
were in the range 1−10 mm in DMSO-d6, CDCl3.

FT-IR Spectroscopy
All reported solid-state FT-IR spectra
were obtained with a Perkin Elmer Spectrum RX1 spectrophotometer,
with the KBr disk technique and in MeOH solution.

MS
Mass spectra were recorded on a Q-Tof Micro YA263
high-resolution (Waters Corporation) mass spectrometer by positive-mode
electrospray ionization.

FE-SEM
Morphologies of the reported
compounds were
investigated using FE-SEM. A small amount of each sample solution
was placed on a clean glass slide and then dried by slow evaporation.
The material was then allowed to dry under vacuum at 30 °C for
2 days. The materials were gold-coated, and the micrographs were taken
in an FE-SEM apparatus (Jeol Scanning Microscope-JSM-6700F).

AFM
The morphology of the reported compound was investigated
by AFM. A small amount of the dichloromethane solution of peptide 1 was placed on a paper and then dried by slow evaporation.
The material was then allowed to dry under vacuum at 30 °C for
2 days. Images were taken with an NTMDT instrument, model no. AP-0100
in the semicontact mode.

Wide-Angle X-ray Diffraction Study
The wide-angle X-ray
scattering pattern was made on the solid of peptide 1. The experiment was carried out in a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer
(C 3000) with a parallel beam optics attachment. The instrument was
operated at 45 kV voltage and 200 mA current and was calibrated with
a standard silicon sample. The sample was scanned from 5 to 60°
(2θ) in the step scan mode (step size 0.02°, preset time
2 s), and the diffraction pattern was recorded using a scintillation
scan detector. The wavelength of the X-ray source is 1.5418 Å
(Kα value of Cu).

CD Spectroscopy
CD study of the
reported peptides in
methanol has been carried out on a JASCO J-815-150S instrument at
a temperature of 25 °C.

DSC
To investigate
the change of the thermal behavior,
DSC experiments were performed. The DSC experiments were done in a
METTLER DSC instrument under a N2 atmosphere. As-synthesized
materials and xerogels were taken in aluminum standard 40 mL vessels
with a pin, tightened with an O-ring. These samples were then heated
from −30 to 250 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C/min.
The instrument was calibrated with indium and cyclohexane.

Bacteriological
Study
The growth of E. coli on the paper surface under aqueous media
has been monitored. Under same condition, the peptide 1-coated paper inhibits the growth of E. coli on the paper surface, for up to 10 days.

Rusting Study
One iron nail was dipped in dichloromethane
solution of peptide 1 and dried. Then, we coated half
a portion of another iron nail with dichloromethane solution of peptide 1 and dried. The peptide 1 does not react with
iron and the coated part exhibits no color change. The third nail
was without any coating and used as control. All three nails were
treated with water for 12 h.

H2S Pollution
Study
Half a portion of a
silver artifact was coated by peptide 1 solution in dichloromethane.
There is no color change or morphological change by coating with peptide 1. Then, the artifact was treated with hydrogen sulfide gas
for 1 min.
