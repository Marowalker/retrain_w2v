Exonuclease III (Exo III) is an important
enzymatic tool that is
being widely used in molecular biology, biotechnology, and bioassay
development. Exo III prefers to cleave double-stranded DNA (dsDNA)
with blunt and recessed 3′-termini rather than their protruding
counterpart. While it has been accepted that a short 3′-overhang
(e.g., >4 nt) is necessary to protect a dsDNA from Exo III cleavage,
critical roles of the length and sequence of this 3′-overhang
remain unexplored. Herein, we develop a novel light-induced colorimetric
assay allowing the systematic probe of the sequence selectivity of
Exo III in a rapid and high-throughput manner. Our finding that Exo
III is highly specific to 3′-overhang in terms of both length
and sequence will be valuable for guiding the design of bioassays
and DNA manipulating tools mediated by Exo III.

Introduction
Exonuclease III (Exo
III) that catalyzes the stepwise removal of
mononucleotides from 3′-hydroxyl termini of a double-stranded
DNA (dsDNA) is being widely used as an enzymatic tool for diverse
biological and biotechnological applications.1−4 It has also been adopted for developing
sensitive analytical assays for biologically and clinically important
molecules, such as nucleic acids, proteins, and small molecules.5−16 Because it selectively cleaves dsDNA with blunt or recessed 3′-termini
over dsDNA with protruding 3′-termini (Scheme 1), Exo III has been used extensively to facilitate
the signal transduction and amplification for the sensitive detection
of diverse target molecules.5−16 The real-time observation of the single-molecule DNA hydrolysis
was also achieved with the assistance of Exo III.17−20

When applying Exo III to bioassay
development, it is critical to
ensure the target-specific dsDNA cleavage, which relies primarily
on the high substrate selectivity of Exo III to dsDNA over single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA).5,8,21−25 A dsDNA with 3′-protruding termini may also resist Exo III
cleavage, but such a resistance depends on the length of the 3′-overhang.26 Brutlag and Kornberg observed that dsDNA with
up to three mismatched terminal nucleotides at 3′-termini could
be hydrolyzed by Exo III, whereas the terminal mismatches of more
than 4 nt were resistant to the cleavage.27 As such, a frequently used rule of thumb to protect dsDNA from the
Exo III cleavage for bioassay development is to use a 3′-overhang
with a length of more than 4 nt.24,28−30 However, the substrate selectivity of Exo III toward the length
of the 3′-overhang has never been systematically probed. It
is also unclear if the substrate selectivity of Exo III also depends
on the sequences of the 3′-overhang.31 To meet this knowledge gap and guide the better design of Exo III-assisted
assays, it is critical to systematically examine the selectivity of
Exo III to 3′-overhangs of the dsDNA substrates.

Classic
methods for studying the catalytic activity of Exo III,14,32 such as radioisotope tracing25 and gel
electrophoresis,26 are tedious, time-consuming,
and unable to monitor the cleavage reaction in real time. The use
of radioisotopes (3H or γ-[32P] ATP-labeled DNA)
is not user-friendly. Herein, we develop a simple and rapid light-induced
photosensitization colorimetric assay33−36 that is capable of systematically
probing the sequence selectivity of Exo III in a high-throughput time-resolved
manner (Figure 1A).
This assay is developed based on our previous observation that the
widely used DNA intercalating dye, SYBR Green I (SG), could serve
as a type II photosensitizer upon intercalation to dsDNA and trigger
the conversion of a colorless 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB) substrate to its blue oxidative product (oxTMB). As this light-induced
reaction is simple, sensitive, and highly dsDNA-specific, we harness
it as a colorimetric readout for measuring the activity of Exo III.

Results and Discussion
Photosensitization Colorimetric
Assay for Exo III Activity Probing
The light-induced photosensitization
colorimetric assay capable
of probing the activity of Exo III is illustrated in Figure 1A. A dsDNA can be quantified
colorimetrically using SG as a photosensitizer and TMB as a chromogenic
substrate. Upon light irradiation, the SG intercalated in the dsDNA
triggers the production of a highly reactive singlet oxygen (1O2) that oxidizes the colorless TMB into blue oxTMB.
We have shown previously that the sensitivity of our photosensitization
colorimetric assay for quantifying dsDNA was comparable with the fluorescence
turn-on assay mediated by SG in combination with fluorescence spectroscopy.33−36 The use of colorimetric readout further reduces the need for expensive
fluorescent microplate reader or devices used for quantitative polymerase
chain reactions. In the presence of Exo III, the cleavage of dsDNA
is initiated from the 3′-hydroxyl termini, producing nucleoside-5′-monophosphates
and ssDNA. As ssDNA does not mediate SG photosensitization, TMB is
not oxidized and no colorimetric signal can be produced. Therefore,
compared to a dsDNA control without the Exo III cleavage, the signal
attenuation quantitatively reflects the level of dsDNA cleavage and
thus the activity of Exo III (Figure 1B). The dsDNA substrate for Exo III can be either linear
or a hairpin, and its cleavage can be quantified using the colorimetric
assay (Figure 1C).
We also confirmed that our assay is general for dsDNA cleavage, which
could also be used to monitor the activity of other nucleases such
as DNase I38−40 (Figure 1C). Using this assay, we were also able to probe the Exo III
activity at varying assay conditions including Mg2+, temperature,
and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Figures S1–S3).

Confirming the Substrate Selectivity of Exo
III Using the Photosensitization
Colorimetric Assay
To investigate the specific roles of the
3′-termini of a dsDNA substrate, we designed a series of hairpin-based
substrates containing a 8 nt loop, a 30 bp stem, and varying 3′-termini
designs (Table S1). Compared to the dsDNA
substrate, the hairpin substrate contains only one 3′-overhang
(Figure 2A). The use
of hairpin probes as substrates may also help avoid potential stoichiometry
variations for preparing the dsDNA duplex. The cleavage efficiency
is defined as  where Ahaiprin and Ahairpin+Exo III are the absorbances
of oxTMB in the presence of the hairpin substrate and the hairpin
substrate after the Exo III cleavage, respectively. Aloop-5′ is defined as the absorbance of oxTMB in the presence of the green
part ssDNA (Figure 2A, 5′-end to the loop part, Table S1), which was subtracted from Ahairpin to correct for the assay background.

blunt, and protruding ends. (B) Gel-electrophoresis results of the
Exo III cleavage; (C) activity of Exo III toward 3′-protruding
ends of different overhang lengths. The detailed sequences used here
are given in Table S1. Error bars represent
the standard deviation from triplicate analyses.

To confirm that hairpin substrates are suitable for probing the
activities of Exo III, we first measured the activity of Exo III against
three hairpin substrates bearing 3′-recessed, blunt, and protruding
ends, respectively (Figure 2A). As expected, the recessed- and blunt-3′-termini
hairpin substrates showed a much higher cleavage efficiency than the
protruding counterpart (with eight protruding nucleotides), which
is in good agreement with the results of the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) analysis (Figure 2B).

We then tested the activity of Exo III against the hairpin
substrates
with varying overhang lengths from 1 to 8 nt at the protruding-3′-termini
(Figure 2C, with random
3′-overhang sequences; Table S1).
Consistent with the previous report by Brutlag and Kornberg,27 dsDNA was found to effectively resist the Exo
III cleavage when the 3′-overhang is 4 nt or longer, while
Exo III is fully active when the 3′-overhang is 1 or 2 nt.
Interestingly, Exo III became partially active (25% activity) upon
a 3′-overhang of 3 nt. All observations were further confirmed
using the PAGE analyses (Figure S5). Despite
the consistency between the two methods, our assay is simpler, much
faster, and more sensitive than PAGE (Figure S6).

Sequence Selectivity of Exo III on 3 nt 3′-Overhangs
We next investigated the selectivity of Exo III to the sequence
of 3′-overhang. The length of the overhang was fixed at 3 nt
because of the interesting observation mentioned above. Hairpin substrates
with possibly 64 combinations of the nucleotide sequences of 3′-overhangs
(Table S2) were designed and systematically
examined using the light-induced colorimetric assay (Figure 3). We found that the activity
of Exo III was highly dependent on the sequence of the 3 nt overhang
of the hairpin substrates. Based on the observed cleavage efficiency,
we were able to classify the 64 substrates into three unique groups:
weakly resistant to Exo III with cleavage efficiencies >20% (Figure 3A), moderately resistant
with cleavage efficiencies between 10 and 20% (Figure 3B), and strongly resistant with cleavage
efficiencies <10% (Figure 3C).

Figure 3 Evaluating the sequence selectivity of Exo III toward dsDNA with
3 nt overhangs at the protruding-3′-termini. (A) Group weakly
resistant to Exo III hydrolysis; (B) group moderately resistant to
Exo III hydrolysis; and (C) group strongly resistant to Exo III hydrolysis.
The green and orange dotted lines indicate cleavage efficiencies of
20 and 10%, respectively. Results are averages of six parallel studies
with the corresponding standard deviations.

By carefully examining the sequences in each group, we found that
10 of all 16 sequences in the weakly resistant group terminated with
“C” at the 3′ end, while the number of sequences
that terminated with “A”, “T”, and “G”
were 3, 1, and 1, respectively (Figure 3A). By contrast, only 4 out of 32 sequences were terminated
with C in the strong resistance group (Figure 3C) and most sequences in this group ended
with G (11) or T (11). Our observation in the sequence selectivity
of Exo III (C > A > G > T) is close to the observation by
Linxweiler
and Hörz that the activity of Exo III to follows the trend
C > A = T > G.21 We also performed
kinetic
analyses for six representative hairpin substrates, where -AAC, -CGG,
-CGA, and -GAA were chosen from the weakly resistant group and -TCC
and -TTT were picked from the strongly resistant group. The observed
kinetics of the Exo III cleavage for the six chosen substrates were
consistent with that of the observed groups determined by the end-point
measurements (Figure 4).

Figure 4 Hydrolysis kinetics of dsDNA with different 3′-protruding
ends by Exo III. These hairpin structures were selected according
to the results shown in Figure 3, namely, -AAC, -CGG, -CGA, and -GAA from the weakly resistant
group and “-TCC” and “-TTT” from the strongly
resistant group. Error bars represent the standard deviation from
triplicate analyses.

Sequence Selectivity of
Exo III on Longer 3′-Overhangs
We next extended the
six chosen 3′-overhangs as mentioned
above with additional nucleotides so that the hairpin substrates were
of longer 3′-overhangs but terminated with the same 3 nt combination
(Table S3). Despite the observation that
longer 3′-overhangs were more resistant to the Exo III cleavage,
some of the weakly resistant combinations (e.g., -AAC and -CGG) still
show a higher level of cleavage than others (Figure 5), suggesting that the observed trend in Figure 3 may be extended
to dsDNA substrates with even longer 3′-overhangs. Of note,
Linxweiler and Hörz21 concluded
that Exo III digestion was impossible for the 4 nt cases. However,
the substrate difference may also contribute to such an inconsistency,
since a different system with pBR322 fragments generated by restriction
endonucleases (overhangs of 4 and 2 nt and blunt ends) as well as
synthetic linker fragments was used as a substrate.21

Figure 5 Sequence selectivity evaluation of Exo III toward dsDNA with 4,
5, and 6 overhangs at the protruding 3′-termini. Here, the
data were averaged from 6 parallel studies with the corresponding
error bars (standard deviation).

To validate the potential uses of the observed trend for guiding
the sequence design of Exo III-mediated bioassasy, we finally extracted
187 DNA sequences from 150 recently published works that successfully
made use of the sequence selectivity of Exo III for bioassay development
(Table S4). These DNAs were originally
designed to be resistant to the Exo III cleavage. We then classified
all literature sequences according to their last three nucleotides
on the 3′-overhangs (Figure 6) into three groups. Of which, 72% (134 sequences,
group 3) of all literature sequences fall into the strongly resistant
group of Exo III in Figure 3, 20% (37 sequences, group 2) in the moderately resistant
group, and only 8% in the weakly resistant group. This result suggests
that the observed trend in our work is highly relevant to the successful
sequence designs for Exo III-mediated assays in the past years and
thus can potentially be used as a general guide for future assay development.

originally designed to be resistant to the Exo III cleavage. Group
1, group 2, and group 3 refer the number of DNAs with the last three
bases in the 3′-protruding ends falling into the weakly, moderately,
and strongly resistant group of Exo III shown in Figure 3, respectively. The detailed
sequence information is given in Table S4.

Conclusions
We
have systematically probed the substrate selectivity of Exo
III toward the length and sequence of the 3′-overhangs of the
dsDNA substrates using a light-induced colorimetric assay. Exo III
is one of the most frequently used enzymatic tools for bioassay development.
To be target specific, the activity of Exo III has to be sequestered
by protecting the dsDNA substrate with a protruding 3′-overhang,
which could be eliminated through a target-induced conformation change.
Therefore, the design of the 3′-overhang plays a vital role
in the development of Exo III-mediated bioassays. However, current
design strategies are empirical and require many trial-and-error attempts
to ensure an optimal assay performance. Our effort to systematically
probe the sequence selectivity of Exo III reveals that both length
and sequence of a 3′-overhang play critical roles in protecting
the dsDNA from Exo III cleavage. We also established a group of three-letter
nucleotide combinations at the 3′-termini, which are highly
resistant to the Exo III cleavage. More importantly, our findings
are highly consistent with the 187 successful dsDNA substrate designs
from 150 recent published works. Therefore, we anticipate our work
will also serve as a general guide for designing sequences for Exo
III-mediated bioassay development and beyond.

Experimental Section
Materials
3,3′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine
(TMB), citrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, sodium chloride, and
dimethyl sulfoxide were from Aladdin (Shanghai, China). Magnesium
chloride hexahydrate, calcium chloride, and hydrochloric acid were
purchased from Kelong Reagent Co. (Chengdu, China). SYBR Green I (SG,
10 000×), Exo III, and deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) were
from ThermoFisher Scientific. The concentration of 10 000×
SG is calculated to be 19.6 mM according to the research from Vitzthum
et al.37 All the oligonucleotides were
provided by Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China), and
the detailed sequence information is given in Tables S1–S3.

Exo III Assay
To obtain the hairpin
structure, all
of the oligodeoxynucleotides were dissolved with the hybridization
buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM NaCl) to give the final
concentration of 10 μM. Then, the above DNA solution was heated
at 90 °C for 10 min and cooled to 25 °C overnight. In a
typical Exo III assay, a hairpin DNA substrate (1.6 μM) and
Exo III (40 U) were mixed in 100 μL of Tris–HCl buffer
(pH 8.0, 10 mM MgCl2). The mixture was then incubated at
37 °C for the Exo III cleavage, followed by deactivation of Exo
III at 80 °C for 10 min according to the user manual for Exo
III. After cooling down, the mixture was diluted to 2 mL using citrate
buffer (pH 4, 50 mM MgCl2) containing 3.92 μM SG
and 0.2 mg/mL TMB, incubated for 10 min, and then irradiated using
cyan light-emitting diode (3 V, 3 W) for 2 min for developing the
colorimetric readout. The absorbance of this mixture was then measured
at 655 nm for quantifying the activity of Exo III in terms of cleavage
efficiency. For all the measurements, at least three parallels were
carried out.

Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis
(Native-PAGE) Analysis
A 12% native polyacrylamide gel was
prepared using 2.0 mL 5×
TBE (445 mM Tris–boric acid, 10 mM EDTA), 3.9 mL distilled
water, 4.0 mL 30% acrylamide–bisacrylamide (29:1), 0.1 mL 10%
ammonium persulfate, and 6.0 μL Tetramethylethylenediamine.
A mixture of 10 μL of Exo III reaction product and 2.0 μL
of 6× loading buffer was loaded to the PAGE gel and run in 1×
TBE buffer at 140 V for 60 min. The gel was then stained with 4S GelRed
(Shanghai Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd., China) for 5 min. Photographs were
then taken using a C300 Gel imager (Azure Biosystem).
