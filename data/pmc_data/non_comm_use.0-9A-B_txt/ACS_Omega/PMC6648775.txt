In this work, chicken egg white protein
(CEW)-protected gold nanoclusters
(CEW-AuNCs) were prepared from CEW and HAuCl4 to measure
the Cu(II)-induced prooxidant activity of antioxidant compounds such
as epicatechin, epigallocatechin gallate, catechin, rosmarinic acid,
resveratrol, ascorbic acid, and glutathione. These compounds reduced
Cu(II) to Cu(I), and the latter was mainly bound to thiol groups in
the CEW-AuNC structure. As the protein-bound Cu(I) may act as a catalytic
center for generating reactive oxygen species, the Cu(II) reducing
ability of antioxidants is an indirect measure of their prooxidant
potency. The bound Cu(I) may be released with the cuprous-selective
ligand neocuproine (Nc), forming the basis of a spectrophotometric
method measuring absorbance at 450 nm wavelength of the Cu(I)–Nc
chelate. The developed method involved a one-pot synthesis and determination
without preseparation and was applied to binary synthetic mixtures
of studied antioxidant compounds and to certain herbal plant (green
tea, linden, echinacea, and artichoke leaf) extracts to determine
the total prooxidant activities. The obtained results were statistically
compared with those of the literature Cu(II)–Nc assay using
a calcium proteinate-based solid biosensor. The developed biosensor
was durable, reliable, easily applicable, and of low cost and wide
linear range and could determine the prooxidant activities of natural
antioxidant samples with high reproducibility.

==== Body
1 Introduction
In living organisms, reactive
oxygen species (ROS), reactive nitrogen
species (RNS), and free radicals are unavoidably formed during normal
cellular metabolism. Oxidative stress occurs when prooxidants/oxidants
dominate over antioxidants in an impaired balance; this condition
causes damage to the biological macromolecules in the organisms leading
to various diseases.1 Intrinsic and extrinsic
antioxidant defenses of the organisms combat against ROS/RNS. Although
the main health-beneficial effects of natural bioactive compounds
originate from their antioxidant properties, they may exhibit prooxidant
behavior under certain conditions (such as transition-metal ions and
O2).2 One possible definition
of prooxidant activity is the ability of reducing transition-metal
ions to their lower oxidation states by antioxidant compounds, stimulating
the production of reactive species which can cause various diseases
via Fenton-type reactions.3 Therefore,
understanding the antioxidant/prooxidant behavior of bioactive substances
depending on the structures and conditions in which they are found
is of great importance.

Iron and copper ions are essential for
electron-transfer reactions
in biological systems, rendering their dietary intake necessary for
all living organisms. However, when these ions are in their free unbound
form, they can interact with oxygen by catalyzing Haber–Weiss
and/or Fenton reactions. Such reactions give rise to the generation
of ROS, which may lead to oxidative damage to biological macromolecules
(DNA, proteins, and lipids).4 These damages
may cause many serious diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative
diseases, some types of cancer, and aging.4−7 The mechanism of oxidative damage
by copper(II) in the presence of H2O2 probably
involves the formation of a copper-coordinated peroxy species or singlet
oxygen (1O2). Cupric ions may further react
with superoxide anions to produce hydrogen peroxide and cuprous ions.
The indicated redox cycling of Cu(II,I) may catalytically generate
hydroxyl radicals in vivo.5,8,9 In this respect, a full grasp of Cu-induced damage on DNA can be
of vital importance in understanding the mechanism of copper-related
diseases.

Polyphenolic compounds found in plants and plant foods
are known
for their antioxidant properties. Fruit- and vegetable-rich diets
may give rise to increased polyphenol concentrations in the plasma
of concerned people, ranging between 0.3 and 10 μM. If polyphenol
is oxidized to a corresponding quinone, the involved redox cycling
can make that compound a prooxidant. Thus, certain polyphenols owe
their prooxidant activity to the redox cycling in which polyphenol-reduced
cupric ions (i.e., to the cuprous state) increase the availability
of copper to enable the reaction with hydrogen peroxide or other ROS.5,10

All kinds of gold nanomaterials [comprising nanoparticles
(NPs),
nanoclusters (NCs), nanosheets] have been used in diverse scientific
and technological fields because of their excellent optoelectrical,
chemical, and catalytic properties.11 Especially,
gold NCs (AuNCs) may be distinguished for their facile synthesis,
good solubility and fluorescence, photostability, biocompatibility,
and reduced toxicity.12 As opposed to many
toxic and environmentally unfriendly organic substances frequently
used as reducing or protection agents for the synthesis of noble metal
NPs, various biological molecules have recently been used in fluorescent
NP/NC synthesis, aiming to overcome biocompatibility-related problems.13 The use of AuNPs in the field of medicine, especially
in cancer diagnosis and treatment, has made great progress. An important
advantage of AuNCs is their ability to penetrate to the kidney tissue
because of their very small size and to easily dissipate from the
body to reduce toxicity in vivo.14

Actually, there is a limited number of literature methods for measuring
the prooxidant activity of phenolic compounds, some exploiting protein
damage.15−20 Methods aiming at prooxidant activity measurement are distinctively
scarce when compared to those focusing on antioxidant activity measurement.
As current methods are expensive, laborious, and limited with respect
to application area and interferences, there is a need to develop
easily applicable, low-cost, convenient, fast, sensitive, and highly
reproducible methods that can determine the prooxidant activities
of natural antioxidants. In our previous studies, spectrophotometric
methods were developed using an egg white protein solution21 and a calcium proteinate-based solid biosensor22 to determine the Cu(II)-catalyzed prooxidant
activity of phenolic compounds and ascorbic acid (AA) in order to
fill the gap in the literature.

In this study, chicken egg white
protein-protected gold NCs (CEW-AuNCs)
were prepared to measure the transition-metal ion {Cu(II)}-catalyzed
prooxidant activities of antioxidant compounds, and accordingly, a
spectrophotometric method was developed using reduction of Cu(II)
→ Cu(I) by antioxidants, uptake of Cu(I) by CEW-AuNC, followed
by desorption of Cu(I) from the sensor matrix with the aid of neocuproine
(Nc) to produce the chromophore: Cu(I)–Nc chelate having an
yellow-orange color and strong absorbance at 450 nm. The developed
method was applied to the binary synthetic mixtures of the studied
compounds and to herbal plant extracts for determining total prooxidant
activities (TPAs). The obtained results were statistically compared
with those of the Cu(II)–Nc assay using a calcium proteinate
solid biosensor.22

2 Results
and Discussion
In the literature, AuNCs were often used in
metal ion [such as
Fe(III), Cu(II), and Hg(II)] determination23,24 or biotechnological imaging fields.13,25 In our study,
modified AuNCs were used as a prooxidant sensor for the first time
to measure the Cu(II)-catalyzed prooxidant activities of antioxidant
compounds. A novel spectrophotometric method based on the absorbance
measurement of the Cu(I)–Nc chelate complex was devised, and
the Cu(II)-catalyzed prooxidant activities of phenolic compounds such
as epicatechin (ECAT), catechin (CAT), epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), rosmarinic acid (RA), and resveratrol
(RES) and other antioxidants such as AA and l-glutathione
(GSH) were measured with this sensor. The protein-protected gold NCs
(CEW-AuNCs) were formed using CEWs containing thiol groups and gold(III)
solution (HAuCl4). In the developed method, the antioxidant
compounds reduced Cu(II) to Cu(I), and cuprous ions were assumed to
bind mainly to the thiol groups
in the CEW-AuNC structure and potentially induce ROS formation. It
was proposed that Cu(II) adsorbed to algae was reduced to Cu(I) by
−SH groups and bound as a Cu(I)–S-complex and that copper
toxicity may principally be due to copper binding to intracellular
thiols.26 Although the standard reduction
potential for most semiquinone radical–phenol redox couples
is higher than that of [Cu(II)/Cu(I)], that is, 0.17 V, Cu(II) may
oxidize some antioxidant phenols (i.e., used in prooxidant activity
testing) in the presence of protein thiols and get reduced to Cu(I)
because of the relative stability of the Cu(I)–thiol bond raising
the cupric/cuprous conditional redox potential. The bound Cu(I) may
also exhibit superoxide dismutase activity, leading to the formation
of more H2O2, and also catalyze the decomposition
of H2O2 to produce hydroxyl radicals.27 Copper–protein thiol complexes were proposed
as catalytic centers inducing the formation of ROS associated with
oxidative damage observed in both Alzheimer’s and prion disease.28 The NC-bound Cu(I) could be finally extracted
with an ethanolic Nc solution in the form of a stable Cu(Nc)2+ complex because of the high stability of the cuprous–Nc
chelate in preference to that of Cu(I)–protein thiol bonds.
Thus, we propose in this study that copper-catalyzed prooxidant activities
of phenolic compounds could be indirectly determined by measuring
the absorbance at 450 nm, that is, maximal absorption wavelength of
Cu(I)–Nc.

2.1 Optimization of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic
Acid Concentration
As the proposed CEW-AuNC assay was performed
in a solution medium without separating the NCs, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA) was added to mask the excess Cu(II), which would otherwise
easily oxidize any unreacted antioxidant when Nc was added (i.e.,
Cu(II)—Nc is a strong oxidant having a redox potential of 0.6
V, but in the presence of EDTA, the Cu(II)/Cu(I) reduction potential
would be reduced to such a level that excessive Cu(II)—in the
chelated form—could not oxidize the remaining antioxidant).
In that case, the prooxidant activity could not be precisely measured
because of the interference of unmasked Cu(II) causing a positive
error. On the other hand, by chelating excessive Cu(II) with EDTA,
the added Nc would only react with the already reduced Cu(I) by the
test compounds, indicative of their prooxidant activity. In this respect,
the interference effects that might arise from the solution medium
were eliminated by adding EDTA.

For the optimization of EDTA
concentration, EDTA solution was added to the blank at different concentrations
(1–100 mM) to decrease the absorbance of the blank. The absorbance
measurements of the blank solution with or without EDTA were performed
against distilled water. As shown in Figure 1, 0.1 M EDTA with the lowest blank absorbance
value was selected. This concentration of EDTA was later used for
both the blank and sample solutions.

Figure 1 Optimization of the EDTA concentration.

2.2 Optimization
of Incubation Periods
The first incubation period (Figure 2A) mentioned in the
procedure was the total time required
for the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in CEW-AuNCs and antioxidant
mixtures together with the successive binding of Cu(I) to protein.
The second incubation period (Figure 2B) was the time required to break the protein thiol–Cu(I)
bond by an Nc solution and to separate the bound copper as a Cu(I)–Nc
chelate. The first and second incubation periods were optimized by
using 77 μM ECAT solution. For optimization of incubation periods,
measurements were taken at different times within the range of 0–60
and 0–30 min.

Figure 2 Optimization of the first (A) and second (B) incubation
periods
for 77 μM ECAT.

As shown in Figure 2A,B, the optimal time periods for the first and second incubations
were 30 and 1 min, respectively. The first incubation needed longer
time because of the completion of a series of reactions comprising
a redox reaction (i.e., Cu(II) → Cu(I) reduction) followed
by covalent binding of Cu(I) to protein thiols, but the second incubation
was fast because of an easy ligand exchange (i.e., Nc binds to protein-bound
Cu(I) to produce a distinctively more stable chelate, Cu(I)–Nc)
because the conditional stability constants of Cu(I) complexes formed
with thiol (log K) and Nc (log β2) ligands
were close to 12 and 19, respectively.29−31 As shown in Figure 2B, waiting for the
second incubation was not actually needed as the reaction was almost
complete immediately. Therefore, absorbances could be measured rapidly
after adding an Nc reagent and vortexing the mixture.

2.3 Analytical Performances of Applied Methods
Limit of
detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) as well
as intra- and interday reproducibility (i.e., within- and between-run
precision) of the proposed method as analytical performance for the
chosen standard compound (ECAT) are given in Table 1. The correlation coefficients (r) and dynamic linear ranges (μM) for the tested antioxidant
compounds (ECAT, CAT, EGCG, AA, RA, RES, and GSH) with respect to
the Cu(II)–Nc assays using both soluble CEW-AuNC and solid
calcium proteinate-based biosensors are shown in Table 2.

The order of the molar absorption coefficients of the tested compounds
with respect to the CEW-AuNC and solid protein-based Cu(II)–Nc
assays were EGCG > ECAT > CAT > RES > GSH > AA ≥
RA, and EGCG
> ECAT > CAT > GSH > AA, respectively. The molar absorption
coefficients
of antioxidants followed the same order for the two assays, except
for the compounds which could not be detected with the reference method.
There was a reasonable agreement between the molar absorption coefficients
found by the proposed sensing method and those of the solid protein-based
Cu(II)–Nc assay, with a correlation coefficient of r = 0.9327 (Table 2). This is a strong positive correlation (N = 5 and r2 = 0.8699) at p < 0.05 level (Spearman rank correlation test), showing that the
result is highly significant.

It has been well established in
the literature that depending on
the reaction conditions, some phenolics may exhibit prooxidant and
therefore cytotoxic properties. These parameters affecting the prooxidant
ability may comprise transition-metal ion reduction ability, chelate
complex stability, hydrogen ion activity (pH), and solubility behaviour.32 As a leading characteristic, the transition-metal
reduction potency of polyphenols may assume the primary role for ROS
generation through O2 reduction by metal catalysis.33 In a study, 13 polyphenolic compounds were tested
to inhibit copper-mediated DNA damage using gel electrophoresis, revealing
that both antioxidant and prooxidant abilities depended on polyphenol
concentration. In the mentioned study, the compounds that were characterized
as prooxidants and their concentration ranges (in parenthesis) were
as follows: dopamine (0.2–2000 μM, max at 10 μM),
epicatechin (0.2–500 μM, max at 200 μM), epicatechin-3-gallate
(0.1–4 μM, max at 2 μM), epigallocatechin (0.02–100 μM,
max at 50 μM), gallic acid (4–10 μM, max at 10
μM), methyl-3,4,5-trihydroxybenzoate (0.2–10 μM,
max at 4 μM), n-propyl gallate (0.2–10
μM, max at 4 μM), and quercetin (0.2–2 μM,
max at 2 μM). In the same study, the mentioned compounds showed
antioxidant activity at higher concentrations.

EGCG is a major
catechin in green tea and an effective apoptosis
inducing agent.34 There is growing evidence
that catechins can behave as prooxidants and damage cells because
of the spontaneous formation of H2O2 by polyphenols
in solution.35 Azam et al. (2004)36 reported that oxidative DNA damage and superoxide
anion and hydroxyl radical formation were greater in the case of ECGC
than ECAT. In addition, their findings demonstrated that copper-oxidized
catechins were more efficient prooxidants as compared with their unoxidized
forms,36 confirming our results. RA has
been described as a prooxidant because of its capacity to generate
free radicals and H2O237 in the presence of transition-metal ions.33,37,38 This compound has two diphenolic rings (A
and B), which can be oxidized to their respective o-quinones by autoxidation, generating ROS.37 Although RES is widely believed to be an antioxidant, there is evidence
in the literature to support its prooxidant properties.39−41 Fukuhara and Miyata (1998)42 first reported
that RES had prooxidant activity in the presence of copper ions, which
was further confirmed by the work of Ahmad et al. (2005)43 showing the formation of RES–Cu(II) complex
leading to reduction of cupric ions with concomitant generation of
ROS. GSH and other thiol compounds (such as N-acetyl-l-cysteine and mercaptopropionylglycine) are considered to be
cellular antioxidants, but GSH may produce thiyl radicals (GS•) that potentially cause oxidative damage in biological
systems; the formation and reaction of thiyl radicals can occur in
many different ways and probably depend on factors such as the nature
of the parent thiol compound, local pH, and the presence of O2 or trace metal ions.44

For
the statistical comparison of the soluble CEW-AuNC and solid
Ca-proteinate Cu(II)–Nc assays, the TPAs of the ECAT standard
and the 10-fold diluted artichoke leaf extract were calculated as
ECAT equivalents using the ECAT linear regression equation (Table 3). The F-test results given in Table 3 proved that there was no significant difference at 95% confidence
level between the precisions of both methods. On the other hand, the
arithmetic means in Table 3 may naturally vary, as different antioxidant/prooxidant tests
may have different thermodynamics and kinetics.45

2.4 TPA of Synthetic Mixtures
TPAs of
prepared synthetic mixtures were found as mM ECAT equivalents by dividing
the observed absorbance (A450) to the
molar absorptivity of ECAT and compared with those theoretically found
(Table 4). The theoretical
ECAT equivalent prooxidant activity of a synthetic mixture solution
was calculated by summing up the absorbances of concerned compounds
and dividing by the molar absorptivity of ECAT. The experimental and
theoretical TPA values of the synthetic mixtures were compatible with
each other, where these capacities agreed at 95% confidence level
(Fcalculated = 0.197, Fcritical = 18.513, Fcalculated < Fcritical at p = 0.05).

2.5 TPA of Herbal Plant Extracts
Green
tea (Camellia sinensis), linden (Tilia), echinacea (Echinacea purpurea), and artichoke leaf (Cynara scolymus) were studied as real samples. The major phenolics of mentioned
herbal infusions are as follows: in green tea, epicatechin, catechin,
epigallocatechin-3-gallate, myricetin, kaempherol, and glycosides
of quercetin;46 in linden, catechin, glycosides
of quercetin, glycosides of kaempherol, ester of ferulic acid, and
ester of coumaric acid;46 in echinacea,
caffeic acid, neochlorogenic acid, p-coumaric acid,
ferulic acid, and quercetin;47 and in artichoke
leaf, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, narirutin, apigenin 7-rutinoside,
cynarin, cynaroside, and glycoside of luteolin.48 CEW-AuNC and solid protein-based biosensors were applied
to these microwave-assisted extracts at different dilution ratios.
The TPA values of herbal plant extracts with respect to these assays
were expressed as mM ECAT equivalent, shown in Figure 3. The results obtained by both methods were
compatible with each other at 95% confidence level (p = 0.05, Fcalculated = 3.05, Fcritical = 10.13, Fcalculated < Fcritical).

extracts with respect to the Cu(II)–Nc
assays using CEW-AuNC and solid protein-based biosensors (N = 3).

Evaluation of recovery
values for the CEW-AuNC-based biosensor
was done by spiking two different concentrations of ECAT solution
at 0.1 and 0.2 mM to the diluted herbal extracts. Statistical data
were given in terms of spiked, theoretical (Theo.), and experimental
(Exp.) mM ECAT equivalents in Table 5. The obtained recovery values (Rec.) close to 100%
indicated that the CEW-AuNC-based biosensor was reliable to determine
the TPA values of plant extracts containing natural antioxidants.

3 Conclusions
Protein-protected AuNCs were used for the
first time in this work
in the determination of prooxidant activity of herbal plants. The
preparation of our previous calcium proteinate-based biosensor comprised
successive steps such as pH adjustment, long-term heating, precipitation,
washing, and drying and took about 2 days for complete manufacture.
In contrast, the proposed CEW-AuNC biosensor was prepared within approximately
20 h without any pretreatment. In addition, the procedure took place
in solution and was complete in a single incubation step, unlike the
other multistep methods (involving procedures of centrifugation, filtration,
cleaning, etc.). Therefore, the proposed biosensor contains one-pot
biosynthesis and determinations. Although a second 30 min incubation
is required for the formation of the Cu(I)–Nc complex in the
reference method, the Cu(I)–Nc complex is formed immediately
in the proposed method and does not require any incubation process.
A lower LOD value for the ECAT compound was obtained with the proposed
biosensor than that of the solid protein-based biosensor. As opposed
to the solid protein-based biosensor not detecting the prooxidant
activities of RA and RES compounds, the corresponding values were
perfectly determined by the proposed biosensor. Furthermore, CEW was
firmly held by gold NPs (due to protein–thiol bonding to gold)
forming a stable sensor while the Ca-proteinate solid had a relatively
high ionization constant49 causing partial
leachability of sensor constituents. The developed biosensor was durable,
reliable, less expensive, easily applicable, and gave highly reproducible
results in reporting the prooxidant activities of antioxidant compounds
and herbal extracts. Although it is widely accepted that the antioxidant
compounds exhibit health-beneficial effects, they may exhibit prooxidant
behavior under certain conditions (with regard to the types and concentrations
of antioxidants and transition-metal ions, levels of dissolved O2 and pH, etc.). It is very important to fully understand the
combined antioxidant and prooxidant roles of bioactive substances
classified as “antioxidants” so as to monitor the changes
observed during the shelf life of food components that may be temporarily
subjected to various oxidative stress factors. In conclusion, the
developed CEW-AuNC is believed to be the first prooxidant biosensor
to allow practical analysis in the solution medium and may be of further
use in controlling the composition of special diets as well as the
shelf life and oxidative stability of food.

(Sydney, Australia) was used for absorbance measurements. Telstar
freeze-dryer (Terrassa, Spain) was used to lyophilize the CEW. Inolab
pH 7110 pH-meter (Weilheim, Germany) using a glass electrode was used
to pH measurements. The incubation solutions were stirred using a
Selecta vortex apparatus (Steinhausen, Switzerland). Separation of
the precipitated CEW protein was performed using an Electromag M4812PII
(Istanbul, Turkey) centrifuge apparatus. A Biosan Multi Bio RS-24
rotator apparatus (Riga, Latvia) was used to stir and incubate. A
Bandelin Sonorex ultrasonic bath (Berlin, Germany) was used for the
dissolution of weighed chemicals or preparation of herbal extracts.
A Memmert water bath apparatus (Schwabach, Germany) was used for incubation
process with heating.

4.2 Preparation of Solutions
The NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer solution
at pH 7.4 (0.2 M), copper(II) sulfate solution (1.0 mM), and NH4Ac buffer at pH 7.0 (1.0 M) were prepared in distilled water.
Nc solution (7.5 mM) was prepared daily in EtOH. The stock solutions
of tested phenolic compounds (10 mM) were freshly prepared in EtOH,
AA, and GSH in water at the same concentration. The egg white was
separated from yolk, lyophilized by a freeze-dryer until completely
dry, and then powdered by grinding in a mortar. The protein solution
(at 10 mg mL–1) was prepared by dissolving this
powder in distilled water.

4.3 Preparation of Synthetic
Mixtures
Binary combinations of antioxidant compounds, the
concentrations
of which were set to remain within the linear concentration ranges
of the assay, were prepared for measuring their prooxidant activities
as mM ECAT equivalent with respect to the CEW-AuNC-based biosensor.
The contents of the binary mixtures were given below:

Mixture
1: 30.7 μM ECAT + 307.7 μM AA.

Mixture 2: 307.7
μM AA + 307.7 μM RA.

Mixture 3: 61.5 μM RES
+ 615.4 μM GSH.

4.4 Preparation of Herbal Plant
Extracts
Herbal plant (green tea, echinacea, linden, and
artichoke leaf) extracts
were prepared using the microwave-assisted extraction technique. Dried
samples (1.0 g) were extracted with 20 mL of aqueous MeOH (80%, v/v)
in a microwave oven under stirring. The samples were heated for 3
min to a temperature of 80 °C, kept at 80 °C for 5 min,
and finally cooled to room temperature. Before analysis, the herbal
plant extracts were filtered through a Gaussian filter/polyester (1.0/0.45 μm) microfilter. The extracts were
generally analyzed freshly but were stored at −20 °C in
a deep freezer if not instantly analyzed.

4.5 Preparation
of a CEW-AuNC-Based Prooxidant
Sensor
The CEW-AuNCs were synthesized after a slight modification
of the method of Li et al. (2017).23 Briefly,
25 mL of 10 mg mL–1 protein solution was added to
25 mL of 2.5 mM HAuCl4 solution, which was diluted from
the stock solution at 1.49 M, and vortexed for 2 min. To the mixture,
3.5 mL of 1 M NaOH solution was added and incubated in a 37 °C
water bath for 20 h. After the incubation period, the formed CEW-AuNCs
were stored in the refrigerator at 4 °C before use (Figure 4). The formed CEW-AuNC
solution was tested for stability and was observed that it preserved
its stability after 3 months of storage at +4 °C in a refrigerator.

4.6 Cu(II)–Nc Assay Using the CEW-AuNC-Based
Biosensor
To a test tube were placed 1 mL of CEW-AuNC, 1
mL of NaH2PO4/Na2HPO4 buffer
(pH 7.4), 1 mL of Cu(II) solution (1.0 mM), (x) mL
of standard antioxidant or sample solution, and (2 – x) mL of distilled water. The test tubes at 5.0 mL were
vortexed and shaked at room temperature for 30 min in a rotator. Afterward,
0.5 mL of EDTA solution (0.1 M) was added to eliminate excessive Cu(II)
in the medium and vortexed. Both blank and sample solutions contained
identical concentration of EDTA. To the mixture, 1 mL of 7.5 mM Nc
was added to obtain the Cu(I)–Nc complex and the absorbance
at 450 nm was measured against the blank solution prepared under identical
conditions excluding the analyte. The linear regression curve (absorbance
vs concentration graphs) for each tested antioxidant was constructed
under described conditions, and the indirect molar absorptivity of
the CEW-AuNC-based Cu(II)–Nc assay for each antioxidants was
calculated from the slope of the calibration curve.

4.7 Cu(II)–Nc Assay Using Calcium Proteinate-Based
Solid Biosensor
This method,22 developed by our study group, was based on the measurement of the
450 nm absorbance of the Cu(I)–Nc chelate formed by Nc with
a protein-bound copper(I) ion, which was previously shown to mainly
bind to the thiol groups of protein. Briefly, the solid prooxidant
sensor was incubated with the Cu(II) ion in a medium containing phosphate
buffer and antioxidant solution at different concentrations. This
was the process required for Cu(II) reduction to Cu(I) and eventual
binding to protein thiols. At the end of this period, the aqueous
phase was decanted and the solid prooxidant sensor was washed with
pure water to eliminate the interference effects that could come from
unreacted compounds. During the second incubation step, the Cu(I)–Nc
chelate was extracted with ethanolic Nc from a solid protein to the
solution phase, and absorbance was measured at 450 nm.
