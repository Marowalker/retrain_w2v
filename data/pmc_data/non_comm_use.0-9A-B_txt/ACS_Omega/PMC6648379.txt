An
efficient access toward novel tridentate ligands based on 1,7-dipyridinyl-substituted
bis-pyrazolo[3,4-b:4′,3′-e]pyridines (BPs) and their usefulness as fluorescent probes for cation
detection is reported. The synthesis proceeds by a three-step sequence
starting from 2-chloropyridine (1), all reactions were
performed using microwave radiation under solvent-free conditions,
and an overall yield of up to 63% was obtained. Photophysical properties
of three representative 1,7-dipyridinyl-BPs (PBPs, 6a–6c) substituted at position 4 with different
donor (D) or acceptor (A) groups were investigated. Compounds exhibited
large Stokes shift in different solvents and strong blue light emission
in both solution and solid state, and quantum yields were as high
as 88% for some of them; thus, a twisted intramolecular charge transfer
(TICT) fluorescence mechanism characteristic of the 1,4,7-triaryl-BPs
was confirmed. The 4-phenyl-substituted probe (Ph-PBP, 6b) was used successfully in the detection of some metals (Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+) by fluorescence
quenching phenomena, which could be reversed in the presence of ethylenediamine.
This probe showed a greater sensitivity toward Cu2+ in
concentrations as low as 26 nM, and in the process of “on–off–on”
for this fluorescent molecular switch, only 1 equiv of the analyte
was used.

Introduction
Fused N-heterocycles have attracted considerable
attention, owing to their wide biological and physicochemical applications,
and hence became an important area of research in synthetic organic
chemistry.1 For instance, pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine derivatives are an important system due to their
proven utility as bioactive compounds,2 organic fluorophores,3 and ligands to
coordination complexes.4 Pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines synthesis mainly involves the interaction between N-substituted 5-aminopyrazoles with 1,3-bis-electrophilic
reagents (e.g., β-dicarbonyl compounds,5a α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds,5b among others5c−5f).5 Reactions using α,β-unsaturated
carbonyl compounds have been successfully applied in forming this
precursor in situ from arylaldehydes and active methylene compounds
(AMC) by tricomponent reactions.6,7a However, sometimes,
these reactions proceed without the participation of AMC, obtaining
bis-pyrazolo[3,4-b:4′,3′-e]pyridines (BPs) via the pseudo-tricomponent reaction of arylaldehyde
with 2 equiv of aminopyrazole,7 according
to the synthetic method reported.8 BPs
have received little biological interest, although they have been
attractive for photophysical applications8c,9 due
to their 1,4,7-triaryl-substituted derivatives exhibiting a high fluorescence
in both solution and solid state by a typical twisted intramolecular
charge transfer (TICT) mechanism (Figure 1).9,10

Fluorescence phenomena
that involve charge transfer (CT) have been
observed in various N-heterocycles substituted with
different electron–donor (D) and electron–acceptor (A)
groups;11 these processes include intramolecular
charge transfer (ICT),11a metal–ligand
charge transfer (MLCT),11b and twisted
intramolecular charge transfer (TICT).11c Phenomena governed by TICT involved molecular conformations and
a strong intramolecular CT occurring in the excited state by polar
solvent relaxation around the molecule to produce a continuing rotation
of electron donor and acceptor around single bonds until it is twisted
to about 90°.12 The equilibration
between a relaxed perpendicular conformer and a coplanar conformer
regularly results in dual fluorescence, that is, from a high energy
band by relaxation of the locally excited (LE) state and from a lower
energy band by emission from the TICT state.12 This phenomenon is very sensitive to D–A efficacy and strength,
the microenvironment (e.g., polarity and viscosity of solvent), and/or
steric hindrance (e.g., alkyl groups near the D–A junction).12 In addition, if the structural relaxation of
excited states includes more than one bond simultaneously (e.g., polyaryl-substituted
molecules), the resulting TICT states may acquire great fluorescence
quantum yields. The class of fluorophores based on TICT mechanisms
can be called “molecular rotors”, which could vary its
fluorescence intensity in sterically restricted environments that
limit molecular rotations, for example, viscous media or the presence
of metal ions to form complexes.12,13 Consequently,
the design of fluorescent sensors for metal ions based on TICT is
an interesting innovative area of research due to their notable structural
and photophysical properties of modular design, in addition to advantages
offered by all fluorescence-based probes (e.g., simple handling, high
sensitivity, and real-time response monitoring).14

Fluorescent probes have served as useful tools for
selective recognition
of metals and thus have been widely exploited to detect biologically
or environmentally relevant metal cations, such as Hg2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Cu2+, Co2+ ions, etc.15−20 However, the TICT-based fluorescent chemosensors are still very
scarce, although it is believed that the well-designed probes should
show a very good act.12,16 Copper is an essential trace
element for the activities of enzymes because of its redox-active
nature, but at higher concentrations, Cu2+ ions can be
highly toxic to the organisms because they can displace other metal
ions that act as cofactors in enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The unregulated
Cu2+ ions can cause oxidative stress, and their increase
in the neuronal cytoplasm may contribute to the etiology of Alzheimer’s
or Parkinson’s disease.17 Cobalt
is another vital trace element being part of cobalamin and a few metalloproteins.
Co2+ ions can be mildly toxic, and unregulated exposure
may cause detrimental effects including heart disease, elevated red
blood cells accompanied by increased cells in the bone marrow, vasodilation,
and flushing.18 Nickel is also an essential
trace element in biological systems (respiration, biosynthesis, and
metabolism) but is an important environmental pollutant; however,
a very few fluorescent probes for Ni2+ ions have been reported
due to their paramagnetic nature causing fluorescence quenching.19 On the other hand, mercury is one of the more
severe environmental pollutants that is very harmful to humans; specifically,
methylmercury, yielded from the microbial biomethylation of Hg2+, is known to cause brain damage and other chronic diseases.20 Therefore, research studies on rapid and sensitive
analysis of the previously described metal ions are much needed.

All these aforementioned aspects, together with our interest in
developing efficient protocols for the construction of novel pyrazole
derivatives5d,11a,21 and our recent research about the design of fluorescent probes,22 have encouraged us to propose the synthesis
of 1,7-dipyridinyl-BPs (PBPs) 6a–6e. These compounds are novel tridentate ligands, whose synthesis proceeds
by a three-step sequence under microwave starting from 2-chloropyridine
(1). Ligands 6a–6e contain
a fused tricyclic structure that is dialkyl- and triaryl-substituted
and also have three pyridine nitrogen atoms (C=N:) suitably
situated to achieve the formation of chelates.14,17−20,22a,23 Thus, we have hypothesized that PBPs 6a–6e have the necessary features for their use in the detection
of metal ions through the fluorescence quenching process based on
TICT mechanisms (Scheme 1b).8−10,12 In this work, compounds 6a–6e showed a high fluorescence emission
in different solvents and large Stokes shifts due to the TICT process
being favored. In addition, the presence of a 2-pyridyl group at positions
1 and 7 of the bis-pyrazolopyridinic core has not yet been reported.
The 1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole 4 playing an important role
in the achievement of probes 6a–6e has been obtained in poor yield via a two-step sequence under reflux
that starts from 2-chloropyridine (1).24 Likewise, the reaction of arylaldehydes 5 with
2 equiv of the 1-phenylpyrazole 4′ to produce
1,4,7-triaryl-BPs in high yields has been reported (Scheme 1a).8 However, the presence of the 2-pyridyl group at position 1 of the
starting aminopyrazole (i.e., 4) could decrease its reactivity
with 1,3-bis-electrophilic reagents, which would complicate the synthesis
of 6a–6e (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Approach for the Synthesis of PBPs 6a–6e; (a) Reported Synthesis and (b)
Proposed Synthesis
Results and Discussion
Synthesis
We started our work by
synthesizing 2-hydrazinopyridine
(2) through an aromatic nucleophilic substitution (SNAr) reaction between 2-chloropyridine (1) and
hydrazine monohydrate,5f,24a obtaining the precursor 2 as a yellow-orange solid in 88% yield. Then, the synthesis
of 5-amino-3-methyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole (4) was carried
by the cyclocondensation of 2 with 3-amino-2-butenenitrile
(3),5f,24b thus forming the expected 5-aminopyrazole 4 as yellow crystals in 91% yield. Notably, both reactions
proceeded efficiently under solvent-free conditions via microwave-assisted
organic synthesis (MAOS) using a specialized reactor, which is novel
and useful for us due to the synthetic potential of these precursors.5−8 Results of these two reaction steps are shown in Scheme 2.

Scheme 2 Synthesis of 5-Amino-3-methyl-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole
(4)aaReaction conditions: (i) 1 (10.6 mmol) and NH2NH2·H2O
(42.4 mmol); (ii) 2 (0.7 mmol) and 3 (0.7
mmol). Both reactions proceeded under solvent-free conditions in microwave.
With the 5-amino-1-(2-pyridyl)pyrazole
precursor 4 in hand, we envisaged that the microwave-assisted
reaction between 4 and arylaldehydes 5 could
be used to synthesize
1,7-di(2-pyridinyl)-bis-pyrazolo[3,4-b:4′,3′-e]pyridines 6a–6e (Scheme 1b). It is important
to note that the precursor 4 could have less reactivity
than the 5-amino-1-phenylpyrazole 4′ frequently
used in the achievement of this poly-heterocyclic system8 due to the electron–acceptor nature of
the 2-pyridyl group on compound 4.5f,22b,24a Likewise, reported reactions
under solvent-free microwave conditions were carried out in a Pyrex
glass open vessel using a domestic oven (Scheme 1a).8a In this
context, we proposed to carry out MAOS using our focused microwave
reactor to properly control the reaction conditions.5d,5f,11a,21,25 Initially, we evaluated the synthesis of
the fluorophore 6′ via the reaction of benzaldehyde
(5b) with 2 equiv of the freshly synthesized amine 4′(26) to establish initial
conditions of the synthesized ligand 6b. Compound 6′ could not be used to chelate metals but can work
as a reference in our later photophysical studies. Pleasantly, the
reaction under solvent-free microwave conditions at 220 °C for
15 min provided the fluorescent bis-pyrazolopyridine 6′ in 79% yield, but when the reaction was carried out with the pyrazole 4 under the same conditions, a novel nonfluorescent product, 6b1, was obtained (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Synthesis of bis-Pyrazolopyridine 6′ and the
PBP 6b via the Intermediate 6b1aaReaction conditions: (i) 4 (1.0 mmol) and 5 (0.5 mmol) under solvent-free conditions in microwave.
NMR spectrum data and HRMS
analysis suggested that 6b1 was resulted from the reaction
between two molecules of the amine 4 and one benzaldehyde
molecule (5b) with the
later loss of one water molecule (see the Experimental
Section and Supporting Information).8a,27 Despite the analysis by NMR that confirms
the formation of the intermediate 6b1, its corresponding
exact mass was not observed by HRMS. The observed ion corresponds
to the exact mass of the other intermediate 6b2, evidencing
an 1,4-elimination process under those experimental conditions. The
microwave irradiation of 6b1 for 5 additional min at
250 °C led to the formation of the desired fluorescent compound 6b in quantitative yield. Likewise, this product was directly
obtained during 15 min of reaction at 250 °C. These findings
confirm that the reactions proceed via intermediate 6b1 (and 6b2) that later cyclizes with subsequent loss
of ammonia and hydrogen molecules (Scheme 3), such as what was proposed in a previous
work.8 Results showed that higher temperatures
tend to favor the formation of the product 6b without
using any additive or catalyst, which confirms our hypothesis about
the lower reactivity toward electrophilic reagents of the aminopyrazole 4 versus 4′ by the presence of a 2-pyridyl
group on 4. Besides, we tested the reaction using FeCl3 according to the conditions reported by Yin and co-workers,8c but there was no conversion in said conditions
or even under microwave at different temperatures (130–200
°C), possibly because of the chelating nature of 4.

Once the optimal conditions to obtain the ligand 6b was achieved, we then examined the scope of this pseudo-tricomponent
reaction using a variety of arylaldehydes, 5a–5e, substituted with different donor (D) or acceptor (A) groups.
Gratifyingly, we found that the corresponding microwave-assisted reaction
afforded the desired bis-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridines 6a–6e in good yields (75–81%),
and all of them showed strong blue light emission in both solution
and solid state (Scheme 4). The reaction proceeded with operational simplicity, and almost
no loss of efficiency was observed for aldehydes tested, which indicated
the low electronic influence of the substituents on the reactivity.
The fluorescent ligands 6a–6e were
efficiently synthesized in three reaction steps under solvent-free
microwave conditions starting from 2-chloropyridine (1) and hydrazine monohydrate. The structures of all synthesized compounds
(precursors 2 and 3, the intermediate 6b′, and products 6a–6e/6′) were elucidated by HRMS analysis, 1H spectroscopy, and 13C NMR spectroscopy. The whole carbon
skeleton was assigned using 13C NMR spectra, combining
with DEPT and two-dimensional 1H and 13C shift
correlation HSQC and HMBC experiments (see the Experimental
Section and Supporting Information for details).

under solvent-free conditions. The photograph was taken using 50 μM
solutions in ethanol and in solid state. A hand-held UV lamp under
a long wavelength (λ = 365 nm) was used.
Photophysical Properties of 6a–6c and 6′
At this
stage of our investigation,
we selected the compounds 6a–6c to
carry out photophysical studies and thus establish the scope of this
type of ligand as fluorescent probes for the detection of metallic
cations. These three fluorophores were selected due to the fact that
they are substituted at position 4 with different donor (D) or acceptor
(A) groups (i.e., 6a (4-An), 6b (Ph), and 6c (4-Py)). Equally, the 1,4,7-triphenyl-BP 6′ was subjected to photophysical studies to have a reference in our
research toward the design of fluorescent probes (Figure 2). The UV–vis and fluorescence
emission spectra of compounds 6a–6c and 6′ were done in toluene (PhMe), dichloromethane
(DCM), acetonitrile (ACN), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), and ethanol (EtOH)
as solvents of different polarities (see Figures S1–S4 and Table S1, Supporting Information). Fluorophores 6a–6c and 6′ exhibited
large Stokes shifts (9623–13700 cm–1), strong blue light emission (high quantum yields), and poor solvatochromic
shift trend in the different solvents evaluated. However, compounds 6c and 6′ displayed a weak fluorescence
intensity in apolar and extremely polar solvents (PhMe and DMSO) and
greater Stokes shifts (11454–13700 cm–1), possibly by the highest charge symmetry (lower polarity) of 6c (triPy-BP) and 6′ (triPh-BP) versus 6a and 6b. Ethanol also showed a curious result
due to its specific hydrogen bonding interactions with these molecules
(e.g., 6a–6c versus 6′ and 6a/6c versus 6b), which
could be explained by the nature of their aryl groups. Compound 6′ only possesses phenyl groups that should not be
affected by ethanol, while the 1,7-dipyridyl groups of 6a–6c would interact with this protic solvent via
hydrogen bonding. In fact, 6′ exhibited its strongest
fluorescence intensity in ethanol with a quantum yield (ϕF) of >99%, but this value decreased markedly in polar aprotic
solvents and much more in nonpolar solvents. Similarly, the 4-aryl
group of compounds 6a (4-Py) and 6c (4-An)
would be more affected by ethanol versus 6b (Ph). The
highest fluorescence quantum yields of ligands 6a–6c were recorded in DMSO because this solvent is able to stabilize
charge separation in the excited state by dipolar interactions. Among
the compounds studied (6a–6c and 6′), 6b showed the strongest fluorescence
intensity with quantum yields (ϕF) in PhMe, DCM,
ACN, DMSO, and EtOH of 39, 74, 67, 88, and 50%, respectively. Ligand 6a presented the lowest fluorescence emission by its lower
stability in the excited state, caused by the electron-donating 4-methoxyphenyl
group (Figure 2). These
findings suggest that the fluorescence of 6 and 6′ is very sensitive to the nature of the solvent as
well as the effect of their aryl groups, that is, microenvironment
effects and the twisting of several bonds in structural relaxation
processes.12

Figure 2 Structure of photophysically
studied fluorophores 6a–6c and 6′.

It is important to note
that in the planar bis-pyrazolopyridinic
moiety, an ICT phenomenon occurs due to the π-excedent character
of pyrazolic ring versus pyridine ring, but its triaryl-derivatives
(e.g., 6 and 6′) have a conformation,
which is not completely planar in the solid state; in fact, the aryl
group at position 4 is almost orthogonal to the heterocyclic core,
probably due to some type of steric hindrance caused by methyl groups
at positions 3 and 5.28 Thus, part of energy
supplied by photons is at expense in the molecular arrangement that
leads to a conformation almost planar in the excited state, which
allows a total CT from a donor moiety of the molecule to the acceptor
4-aryl group (Figure 2). Consequently, these photophysical results confirm that fluorescence
properties of bis-pyrazolopyridines are governed by a TICT mechanism
sensitive to sterically restricted environments that limit molecular
rotations around aryl–BP bonds.9,10 The TICT phenomenon
is responsible for this type of compounds having high fluorescence
quantum yields, and also, ligands 6 can be successfully
used as fluorescent probes of metal ions.9−12,23 Compound 6b was used in further studies of the design
of fluorescent probes of metal ions because this ligand displayed
the strongest fluorescence intensity. Ethanol was selected as a solvent
due to the fact that this is a green solvent, is easily accessible,
has high miscibility in water, and is easy to handle; also, it was
taken into account that the 4-phenyl group of 6b is not
affected by ethanol (Figure 3).

Fluorescence and UV–Vis Response of
Ligand 6b to Metal Ions
Fluorescence spectra
of ligand 6b were taken with an excitation wavelength
(λexc)
of 250 nm in ethanol–water solution (99:1, v/v at pH = 7.14)
to observe the response of blue fluorescence emission toward Cu2+ and other metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+)
dissolved in distilled water. Sensing studies were performed at pH
= 7.14 because it is close to the physiological pH (about 7–7.4),
but since ligands 6a–6e have several
pyridine-type nitrogen atoms (C=N), we would expect notorious
changes in their fluorescence intensities under pH acid with enhanced
blue-shifted emission due to the formation of pyridinium ions.3b

Preliminary studies were carried out by
adding 10 and 100 equiv of each metal to solutions of 6b at 1 μM (fluorescence) and 10 μM (UV–vis), respectively.
Absorption spectra showed no significant changes with any of species
evaluated, but fluorescence emission studies exhibited very interesting
results since moderate-to-total quenching of blue fluorescence was
observed later 1 min upon addition of several of the metal ions added
(Figure 4 and Figure S5). Probe 6b showed good
selectivity toward some ions of biological and environmental importance,
such as Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+, although this ligand was more sensitive and selective for
Cu2+, and the rank was given as follows: Cu2+ > Co2+ > Ni2+ > Hg2+.
In fact,
the photograph shown in Figure 4c was taken using only 1.5 equiv of the respective cation,
and in this one, total quenching of blue fluorescence is observed
solely with Cu2+. Interestingly, compound 6′ showed no changes when Cu2+ was added due to the fact
that this ligand is not tridentate, which proved the usefulness of
this 1,4,7-triphenyl-substituted blue fluorophore as a reference in
our studies (Figure 4). Therefore, we have verified our hypothesis that ligands 6a–6e have the necessary structural features
for their use in metal ion detection by the fluorescence quenching
process based on the TICT process; however, these ions had almost
no effect on the absorption spectra. These ligands could be used in
future research studies based on coordination complexes with biological,
catalytic, and/or technological applications as well as in studies
of acidochromism due to their important electronic properties.

intensity response of 6b to Cu2+ and other
metal ions. The emission intensity was measured at λem = 412 nm. (c) The photograph was taken using 20 μM solutions
of 6b in ethanol and 1.5 equiv of the respective cation.
A hand-held UV lamp under a long wavelength (λ = 365 nm) was
used.

Given our interesting preliminary
results regarding the fluorescence
response of compound 6b toward Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+, we further studied
the reaction using these four metal ions to determine their needed
amount to achieve total fluorescence quenching. In this way, we carried
out this study by adding 0.2 to 100 equiv of each metal to 1 μM
solutions of the fluorescent ligand 6b, and fluorescence
emission spectra (λexc = 250 nm) were recorded later
1 min upon addition of the metal ions (Figure 5 and Figure S6). Results of fluorescence intensity of 6b with different
concentrations of Cu2+ are shown in Figure 5. Likewise, sensitivity data of 6b toward each of the four metals, that is, detection and quantitation
limits (LOD and LOQ), are summarized in Table 1 (also see Figure S7, Supporting Information). It is important to clarify that sensitivity
is different to LOD; the first is only the relationship with the calibration
curve (straight) slope, indicating the change in the property versus
analyte,29 while LOD indicates the lowest
amount of analyte in a sample that can be detected, but not necessarily
quantified, under the stated conditions of the study.30 These results confirm that ligand 6b is highly
sensitive for Cu2+ since, only with addition of 0.2 equiv
of metal, the fluorescence intensity decreases to >50% (Figure 5a). Likewise, detection
and
quantification limits of 6b for Cu2+ are very
low (Table 1, entry
1), which are 0.026 and 0.086 μM (R2 = 0.998, Figure S7a), respectively, meaning that the chemosensor
is able to detect just around 1.6 μg of copper in 1 L of dissolution.
Accordingly, this method offers high sensitivity for determination
of low concentration of Cu2+, which is an ion of high biological
impact.17 On the other hand, values of
LOD and LOQ for Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+ also are somewhat low (Table 1, entries 2–4), which means that, in general, the designed
ligands 6a–6e are very efficient
for these metals and they would form very stable chelates in each
case. The measure was also obtained for the other photophysically
studied ligands 6a and 6c, but the differences
are negligible and the order of magnitude is the same in each experiment.

a Detection and quantitation limits
(LOD and LOQ, respectively) were obtained via plot fluorescence intensity I versus [M2+], where k is the
respective slope. See the Experimental Section and Supporting Information for details.

Notably, the chemosensor 6b was found
to bind Cu2+ ions reversibly as tested by reacting with
ethylenediamine.
The progressive addition of a dissolution of diamine (in ethanol)
to a solution of 6b–Cu2+ complex resulted
in an enhancement of the fluorescence intensity (Figure 5b). The enhancement of the
fluorescence is a result of the high affinity of ethylenediamine (en)
toward Cu2+ (Ka = 4.0 ×
1010 L mol–1 at 25 °C),31 which resulted in the decomplexation of the 6a–Cu2+ chelate and later release of the
fluorescent ligand 6b. As expected, the reversibility
results using the other active ions (i.e., Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+) were also satisfactory (Figure S8).

These experiments were also
used to determine equivalents of the
necessary analyte (M2+ or ethylenediamine) that should
be used in the whole on–off–on process (Table 2), where only 1 equiv of the analyte was used in the switch obtained
through the complex 6b–Cu2+ (Table 2, entry 1, and Figure 5b). Reversibility
of the fluorescence signal (“turn on” or “turn
off”) is an important feature of metal ion-responsive probes,
confirming in this study that the observed fluorescence quenching
is due to active ions M2+ and not the result of artifacts.

Afterward, we examined the scope
of obtained 6b–M2+ complexes in ethanolic
dissolution toward the design
of a novel fluorescent turn-on chemosensor for cyanide based on the
most sensitive complex 6b–Cu2+, according
to similar methods for this detection.32 The cyanide ion (CN–) is an excellent
ligand for coordination compounds, but it is also an extremely toxic
species in the human blood stream that causes cytotoxic hypoxia and
cellular asphyxiation due to the formation of a stable complex with
cytochrome c oxidase, which is the most significant target of cyanide
exposure since its inhibition prevents tissues from using oxygen.22b,22c,32,33 Thus, the design of fluorescent probes based on metal complexes
is of great interest for the sensitive and selective detection of
CN–.32 This
preliminary study was carried out by adding 10 to 32 equiv of NaCN
dissolved in ethanol–water (90:10) to an ethanolic
dissolution of 6b–Cu2+ (Figure 6a), which allowed us to determine
that 32 equiv is the needed amount of CN– to achieve a total fluorescence turn on. In addition, detection
and quantification limits of 6b–Cu2+ for CN– were calculated as 0.324
and 1.079 μM (R2 = 0.992, Figure 6b), respectively.
This LOD is well below the level permitted in drinking water according
to the U.S. EPA (0.2 ppm),22bc and the
World Health Organization (1.9 μM).34 However, it is important to remember that these are preliminary
results and, in future works, the selectivity and competition with
other anions should be evaluated, especially taking into account that
this type of complex (6–Cu2+) in solution
can be easily dissociated in the presence of different anions.

solution upon addition of increasing concentration of CN– (10–32 equiv, λexc = 250 nm). (b) Fluorescence integral area of 6b–Cu2+ (1 μM) with different concentrations of CN– (1000–3200 nM).

HRMS-ESI Analysis of 6a–Cu2+ Complex
To evidence the
formation process of type 6–Cu2+ complexes,
we carried out a high-resolution mass
spectrometry (HRMS) analysis using an equimolar mixture between probably
the most reactive fluorescent ligand 6a and Cu(NO3)2 in acetonitrile–water (10:1, v/v), which
leads to quick fluorescence quenching. The electrospray ionization
mass spectrum (HRMS-ESI) was obtained by dilution in acetonitrile
of an aliquot of the previously prepared mixture containing the complex 6a–Cu2+ (Figure 7). The ion peak at m/z 255.0558, with an intensity of 100%, corresponds to the
dication species [6a + Cu2+]2+ (calcd,
255.0546), and the isotopic peak pattern supports the presence of
copper.35 This experiment also allowed
us to detect an ion peak at m/z 572.0994,
with an intensity of 78%, which is assigned to the monocation species
[6a + CuNO3+]+ (calcd,
572.0976); see Figures S9–S11 for
details (Supporting Information).

Plausible Sensing Mechanism of 6b toward Cu2+
In general, the sensing mechanism and binding mode
of ligands 6a–6e with the active
metal ions M2+ were proposed based on our experimental
results (Scheme 5).
As mentioned above, these ligands exhibited strong blue light emission
by a TICT fluorescence mechanism, typical of compounds containing
the bis-pyrazolopyridinic core (BP), which is sensitive to environments
that limit molecular rotations around aryl–BP bonds of 6a–6e.8−10 Accordingly, upon addition
of some metal ions M2+ to a dissolution of these tridentate
ligands, fluorescence quenching is observed as a result of the coordination 6–M2+, which results in the increase of
their structural rigidity and inhibition of the TICT processes. The
sensing mechanism of 6b toward Cu2+, a possible
ligand–metal charge transfer, and its reversibility process
are shown in Figure 5. It is important to note that the ligand–metal charge transfer
is favored by the tridentate nature of 6b also preventing
the intramolecular charge transfer in 6b, thus producing
fluorescence quenching by a TICT mechanism (Figure 5).

Conclusions
To
sum up, we have developed an efficient and expeditious protocol
to achieve a novel series of 1,7-dipyridinylsubstituted bis-pyrazolo[3,4-b:4′,3′-e]pyridines, 6a–6e, in high overall yield (58–63%).
Products were obtained in three reaction steps (SNAr and
two cyclocondensation processes) under microwave irradiation starting
from 2-chloropyridine (1) and in high isolated yields
at each step. All synthesized compounds were adequately characterized
by spectroscopic and HRMS analysis. Besides the synthetic interest
of the novel triaryl-substituted tridentate ligands 6a–6e, their photophysical importance is highlighted
due to the fact that they exhibit strong blue light emission and proved
to be key fluorophores based on TICT processes by studying photophysical
properties of three representative ligands. These ligands were successfully
used as turn-off fluorescent probes for metal ion detection since
they have three pyridine nitrogen atoms suitably situated to achieve
the formation of chelates, where the probe 6b showed
a good binding ability to Cu2+ with low detection and quantification
limits (26 and 86 nM, respectively, R2 = 0.998). Ligand 6b was found to bind Cu2+ reversibly (on–off–on process)
using 1 equiv of ethylenediamine as a decomplexing agent of 6b–Cu2+. Notably, an ethanolic dissolution
of the complex 6b–Cu2+ was preliminary
studied as a turn-on fluorescent probe for CN– detection,
obtaining detection and quantification limits of 324 and 1079 nM (R2 = 0.992), respectively. Therefore, ligands 6a–6e or complexes 6–M2+ could be used to design novel fluorescent probes
in the detection of different relevant species, so we expect to extend
our studies in this fascinating field of research.

Experimental
Section
General Information
All reagents were purchased from
commercial sources and used without further purification, unless otherwise
noted. All starting materials were weighed and handled in air at room
temperature. The reactions were monitored by TLC visualized by a UV
lamp (254 or 365 nm) and/or with ninhydrin in EtOH. Flash chromatography
was performed on silica gel (230–400 meshes). All reactions
under microwave irradiation were performed using a sealed reaction
vessel (10 mL, maximum pressure = 300 psi) containing a Teflon-coated
stirring bar (obtained from CEM). Microwave-assisted reactions were
performed in a CEM Discover SP focused microwave (ν = 2.45 GHz)
reactor, equipped with a built-in pressure measurement sensor and
a vertically focused IR temperature sensor; controlled temperature,
power, and time settings were used for all reactions. NMR spectra
were recorded at 400 MHz (1H) and 100 MHz (13C) at 298 K using tetramethylsilane (0 ppm) as the internal reference.
NMR spectroscopic data were recorded in CDCl3 using the
residual nondeuteriated signal for 1H NMR and the deuteriated
solvent signal for 13C NMR spectroscopy as internal standards.
DEPT spectra were used for the assignment of carbon signals. Chemical
shifts (δ) are given in parts per million, and coupling constants
(J) are given in hertz. The following abbreviations
are used for multiplicities: s = singlet, d = doublet, t = triplet,
and m = multiplet. Melting points were collected using a capillary
melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. High-resolution mass
spectra (HRMS) were recorded using a Q-TOF spectrometer via electrospray
ionization (ESI). The electronic absorption and fluorescence emission
spectra were recorded in quartz cuvettes having a path length of 1
cm. UV–vis and fluorescence measurements were performed at
room temperature (20 °C). For fluorescence measurements, both
the excitation and emission slit widths were 5 nm. The 3-methyl-1-phenylpyrazol-5-amine
(4′)26 and 4-propoxybenzaldehyde
(5d)36 syntheses were carried
out using a known procedure.

Chemosensor Design
UV–Vis Absorption and Fluorescence
Studies
The
solvatochromic studies of the compounds 6a–6c and 6′ were carried out from 50 μM
stock solutions in PhMe, DCM, ACN, DMSO, and EtOH. UV–vis spectra
were recorded at 1 μM, and fluorescence spectra were recorded
at 1.0 μM, with λexc = 250 or 280 nm according
to maximum absorption wavelength.

Determination of the Relative
Quantum Yields
The relative
quantum yields of 6a–6c and 6′ were obtained by the comparative method using phenanthrene
(ϕF = 0.125 in ethanol at 254 nm) as the reference
and calculated according to the following equation37  where x and st indicate the sample and standard
solution, respectively, ϕ is the quantum yield, m is the gradient derived from the linear regression analysis when
plotting integrated fluorescence intensity against absorbance, and
η is the index of refraction of the solvents.

Response
of Ligand 6b to Metal Ions
The
50 μM stock solution of the chemosensor 6b was
prepared in ethanol–water (99:1, v/v at pH = 7.14). The salts
used in stock solutions were nitrates of each metal ions (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Ba2+, Co2+, Cr3+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Cd2+, Hg2+, and Pb2+). Inorganic salts were dissolved in distilled
water to afford 1 mM aqueous solution. Aliquots of stock solution
of 6b were diluted to 5 mL to make the final concentrations
of 10 μM for UV–vis and 1 μM for fluorescence.
In the selectivity preliminary experiments of 6b to metal
ions, the absorption and fluorescence emission spectra (λexc = 250 nm) were recorded upon addition of 10 and 100 equiv
of various metal ions. The fluorescence intensities were measured
at λem ≈ 412 nm. The fluorescence response
in photographs was excitation at 365 nm using a hand-held UV lamp, 6b (20 μM), and 1.5 equiv of the respective cation.
The further study of fluorescence response of 6b toward
the active ions (Cu2+, Co2+, Ni2+, and Hg2+) was carried out by adding 0.2 to 100 equiv
of each metal to 1 μM solutions of 6b.

Determination
of Detection and Quantitation Limits (LOD and
LOQ)
Detection and quantitation limits of 6b for M2+ (M: Cu, Co, Ni, and Hg) were obtained by 3Sb/k and 10Sb/k, respectively, where k is the slope from the plot fluorescence intensity I versus [M2+], and Sb is the
standard deviation of the I intercepts of regression
lines.22,29,30,38

Reversible Study with Ethylenediamine and
Cyanide Ion
Once quenching each dissolution of 6b with the corresponding
equivalents of each active metal M2+, a dissolution of
ethylenediamine in ethanol–water (99:1) was added, and fluorescence
emission spectra (λexc = 250 nm) were recorded upon
addition of 0.1 to 10 equiv of diamine. The study with the cyanide
ion was carried out using the complex 6b–Cu2+ (λexc = 250 nm) and by adding 1 to 32 equiv
of NaCN dissolved in ethanol–water (90:10).
