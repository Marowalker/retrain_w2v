Synthesis
of electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR)
with not only prominent electrocatalytic performance but also a low
amount of Pt is the urgent challenge in the popularization of fuel
cells. In this work, through a facile synthetic strategy of spray
dehydration on a solid surface and annealing process, we demonstrate
the first manufacture of quaternary structurally ordered PtM3 (M = transition metal) intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs), Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3, in order to lower the content of Pt. The atomic
contents of Pt, Fe, Co, and Ni are equal and the chemical structure
of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 is a cubic L12-ordered structure.
L12-Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C electrocatalysts exhibit
enhanced electrocatalytic performance toward ORR with mass activity
(MA) 6.6 times higher than the commercial Pt/C and a minimal loss
of 17% in MA and 1.5% loss in specific activity (SA) after 10 000
potential cycles at 0.9 V. Furthermore, the stability behavior is
confirmed to be attributed to the coaction of particle sizes and the
ordering effect. Compared with traditional Pt-based electrocatalysts
in the stoichiometric forms of Pt3M and PtM, L12-Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 intermetallic NPs exhibit excellent performance
and higher cost effectiveness. Moreover, this work also proposes a
facile and effective synthetic strategy for manufacturing multicomponent
Pt-based electrocatalysts for ORR.

1 Introduction
Proton-exchange
membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have been considered
to be one of the most satisfactory power supply for electric automobiles
and personal devices where chemical energy of the fuel (for instance,
hydrogen or methanol) is converted into electric energy.1−3 In recent decades, a huge number of research studies have been investigated
on exploring and designing high-efficiency catalysts with superb performance
to expedite the kinetics of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the
cathode because of its dominant role in PEMFC.4−6 On account of
the particular electronic structure of Pt for fast reaction kinetics,
the current electrocatalysts appropriate for ORR primarily contain
the component Pt.7−9 However, there appears a hindrance for the large-scale
application of fuel cells because of the high cost arising from scarcity.
In view of this, extensive efforts have been made on boosting the
electrocatalytic performance and decreasing the content of Pt simultaneously.
Recently, Pt-based alloy electrocatalysts, especially the alloys of
Pt and 3d-transition metals such as Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu have attracted
tremendous attention and interest because of their excellent properties.10−13 The enhancement of electrocatalytic performance is attributed to
electronic structure modification of Pt and the lower d-band center
position resulting from the coalescence of transition metals.14,15 Some popular strategies for designing active electrocatalysts for
ORR primarily focus on the regulation upon morphology and nanocrystalline
growth such as Pt surface-enriched or core–shell nanoparticles
(NPs),16−18 hollow structures,19,20 and specific
polyhedral structures to expose high-index facets.21−23

However,
conventional Pt-based nanocatalysts where the distribution
of Pt and transition-metal atoms is in a random configuration are
usually incompetent for commercial application because of their unsatisfactory
stability arising from particle growth, dissolution of transition
metals, and the corrosion of the carbon support under extreme environments.24,25 Therefore, structurally ordered intermetallic NPs have stood out
for their unique geometrical structure and feature,26 which can be regulated through control over temperature
and annealing atmosphere.27,28 Structurally ordered
Pt-based alloy electrocatalysts combine the excellent activity and
ideal chemical stability together, serving as perfect elctrocatalysts
for the next-generation PEMFCs.

Because of the ligand and strain
effect and the accompanying optimum
electronic structure of the Pt surface for absorption of Oad and OHad, Fe, Co, and Ni are usually employed in Pt-based
catalysts, and hence, Pt–Fe, Pt–Co, and Pt–Ni
nanoalloys are identified as the perfect catalytic system for ORR
with excellent activities.29,30 Whereas, Cu is considered
not applicable for the practical application of PEMFC on account of the poisoning effect because
leached Cu ions can transfer from the cathode and accumulate on the
anode.31 Until now, Pt-based electrocatalysts
with excellent performance are basically binary or ternary intermetallic
in the stoichiometric form of Pt3M or PtM with a relatively
high content of Pt.18,27,28,32−35 Synthesizing cubic L12-PtM3 NPs with a molar ratio of Pt merely one-third of
transition metals can be an effective tactic to prepare active low-Pt
catalysts for ORR. However, structurally ordered PtNi3 cannot
be obtained even after being annealed from 400 to 800 °C because
of its low temperature for disorder-order transition.36 Hence, synergistically employing Fe, Co, and Ni can be
a valid strategy to realize the structurally ordered PtM3 alloy phase. Besides, the widely employed chemosynthesis method
for Pt-based electrocatalysts is relatively complicated and low-producing
to some degree. As a result, synthesis of intermetallic electrocatalysts
in the ordered chemical structure with a low proportion of Pt through
a facile and versatile strategy is the key to the popularization of
fuel cells.

Inspired by this, we demonstrate the first synthesis
of quaternary
structurally ordered PtM3 type NP nanocatalysts L12-Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C simply through spray dehydration
on the solid surface followed by an annealing process. The coalescence
of Fe, Co, and Ni gives rise to the atomic re-establishment and the
ordered chemical structure facilitates the anticorrosive ability against
acid solution. The quaternary PtM3 type NP eletrocatalysts
exhibit outstanding activities and superior stability toward ORR with
a considerably low amount of noble metal Pt, serving as a puissant
substitute for the commercially popular catalysts in the form of Pt3M and PtM. The novel L12-Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C eletrocatalysts and the facile synthetic strategy reported in
this work point out a new direction for exploring promising electrocatalysts
suitable for fuel cells.

2 Results and Discussion
The structurally ordered Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 NP catalysts
were synthesized through an extremely simple strategy compared with
typical chemosynthesis, which generally takes considerable time and
effort. Figure 1 shows
the schematic illustration of the synthetic route, which can be summarized
into a two-step process. The well-dispersed suspension containing
specific amounts of chemicals was prepared in advance after an ultrasonic
processing for 40 min. Then, the spray dehydration method was adopted
to obtain the mixed precursor at molecular level by promptly drying
the suspension on a quartz plate at a temperature of 300 °C.
Compared with the typical spray drying method where atomized materials
are dried out in hot air, spray dehydration on the solid surface has
a faster evaporation rate and leads to more uniform precipitation
of precursor concurrently. Finally, the leftover was scraped off the
quartz plate and then annealed at 600 and 700 °C for 1 h under
the H2 atmosphere [marked as Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700]. In order to verify
the reliability of this synthetic strategy, quaternary NPs containing
Pt, Au, Cu, and Ni were firstly fabricated and investigated because
of the weaker magnetism, which makes them more convenient for scanning
transmission electron microscopes–energy dispersive X-ray (STEM–EDX)
characterization.

ordered NPs acquired after being annealed at high temperature under

The morphological information of PtAuCuNi/C NPs synthesized by
the spray dehydration method was first investigated using a transmission
electron microscope (TEM). As exhibited in Figure 2a, the high-angle annular dark field scanning
transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) image of PtAuCuNi/C
NPs shows a narrow size distribution with an average size of 5.77
nm. Figure 2b shows
the STEM image captured from a representative area and Figure 2c–f shows the STEM–EDX
elemental mappings of all the elements (Pt, Au, Cu, and Ni) contained
in the NPs. It is well-marked that Pt, Au, Cu, and Ni are distinctly
detected and present a uniform distribution among the NPs. The EDX
drift-corrected spectrum images in Figure S1 also confirm the existence of Pt, Au, Cu, and Ni elements. The homogeneously
distributed elemental mappings convincingly certify the synthetic
strategy of spray dehydration on the solid surface followed by annealing
process, making it a convenient and effective strategy for synthesizing
multicomponent NP catalysts for energy conversion applications.

The crystal structures of Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3/C-600 and
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs were then investigated by using
an X-ray diffractometer. XRD patterns in Figure 3a show a typical simple cubic intermetallic
structure. The peak around 25° is considered to be because of
the amorphous carbon support. The other four obvious diffraction peaks
are corresponding to the lattice planes of (111), (200), (220), and
(311) in sequence. It can be observed that the diffraction peak positions
are in good match with that of ordered L12-PtFe3 (PDF # 71-8365), revealing a slight shift to higher angles because
the atomic radii of Co and Ni are a little bit shorter than that of
Fe (shown in Figure S2). XRD patterns indicate
that the four kinds of atoms are incorporated to form a cubic L12-type ordered structure with the space group of Pm3̅m. The atomic ratio among Pt, Fe, Co, and
Ni is further confirmed to be equal by inductively coupled plasma
atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), which is self-consistent with
the XRD patterns and the proportion of metal salt precursors. It should
be noticed that there appear extra ordering peaks around 33°,
54°, and 61°, which correspond to the (110), (210), and
(211) planes, respectively, suggesting that structurally ordered L12-Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 NPs are successfully synthesized
with Pt, Fe, Co, and Ni atoms in an ordered spatial arrangement. On
the basis of XRD patterns and the Scherrer equation, the average crystallite
sizes of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-700 NPs are determined to be 5.0 and 6.1 nm, respectively, as details
shown in Table S1. In particular, Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3-700 NPs reveal a higher degree of ordering seen
from the more distinct (110) ordered peak compared with that of Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3-600 NPs. Figure 3b reveals the magnetic hysteresis loops of Pt(Fe, Co,
Ni)3/C-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs catalysts
carried out from 0 to 2 T at 300 K. The saturation magnetization of
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs is higher than that of Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3/C-600 because NPs with a larger particle size
exhibit higher saturation magnetization at the macro level.37 According to the thermal decomposition behavior
of polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), the percentage of decomposed PVP at
high temperature is about 95%, while 5% of the residue still remains.38,39 In view of this, the alloy loading of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 on the carbon support is confirmed to be 20 wt % through thermogravimetric
analysis under the air environment. Supposing that all transition
metals (M) are oxidized into the form of M2O3, the theoretical remaining weight of the Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalyst is calculated to be 27%. The residue weight is quite
close to the result of 27.7% in Figure S3, which testifies the 20% weight loading of the Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 alloy on the carbon support (calculation details in Supporting Information). Therefore, the content
of Pt in Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts is extremely low compared
with traditional Pt3M and PtM type catalysts.

and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs. The green vertical curves
are the standard XRD characteristic lines of ordered L12-PtFe3 (PDF # 71-8365). (b) Magnetic hysteresis loops

The morphological information and microstructure of Pt(Fe, Co,
Ni)3 NPs were further investigated by using a TEM and a
high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM). Figure 4a shows the low-resolution
TEM image of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-600 NPs distributed on the
carbon support. It is observed that the NPs are uniformly distributed
on the support with a good sphericity (also shown in Figure S4). Figure 4b reveals the high-resolution TEM image of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 NP, indicating that the quaternary NPs are well crystallized.
The Fourier transform pattern of Figure 4b is shown in Figure 4c, exhibiting three pairs of diffraction
spots corresponding to the facets of (200), (111), and (1 –
1 – 1). The pattern is further confirmed to be projected on
the zone axis of [0 – 11], and the lattice spacings of these
three facets are calculated to be 0.185, 0.213, and 0.213 nm, which
are in good agreement with XRD patterns. Similarly, low-resolution
TEM images of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-700 NPs are exhibited in Figures 4d and S5, while the HR-TEM image is displayed in Figure 4e. Figure 4f reveals the histograms of
the particle size distribution of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 NPs corresponding
to the TEM images in Figure 4a,d. The histograms both exhibit a narrow size distribution,
and the average particle sizes of these two NPs are determined to
be 5.09 and 6.86 nm severally, which are consistent with the particle
sizes obtained from XRD patterns.

In order to assess the electrocatalytic activity
of Pt(Fe, Co,
Ni)3/C NPs, electrochemical measurements were investigated
in depth with the rotating disk electrode (RDE) method, where cyclic
voltammetry (CV) profiles and linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) curves
were both carried out. The ORR polarization curves of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs at different
rotation speeds in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution
are displayed in Figure 5a,b, severally. According to the Koutecky–Levich (K–L)
equation, there is a linear relationship between J–1 and ω–1/2 and the electron transfer number
of NPs under different potentials can be obtained through the straight
slope of K–L plots.18 Based on the
straight slopes from Figure 5a, the electron transfer numbers of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 at 0.775, 0.835, 0.895, and 0.905 V are calculated to be 3.95,
4.00, 4.00, and 3.86, respectively, indicating that the Pt(Fe, Co,
Ni)3/C-600 NPs are efficient for ORR, and the reaction
undergoes a complete four-electron transfer process where O2 is directly reduced to H2O without the intermediate hydrogen
peroxide. Similarly, the electron transfer numbers of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs are also determined to be 3.60, 3.60, 3.73, and
3.69, severally, (summarized in Table S2). As a reference, K–L plots and electron transfer numbers
of commercial Pt/C are revealed in Figure S6, which is obviously insufficient compared with Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C NPs catalysts under lower overpotentials. The electron
transfer number approaching four indicates that the Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C electrocatalysts exhibit high-efficiency and excellent
performance toward ORR even under low overpotentials. Figure 5c displays the CV profiles
measured in N2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution
at a rate of 50 mV s–1 in the range of 0.05–1.1
V. Apparently, the cathodic peak positions of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 (0.759 V) and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 (0.760 V) catalysts
show a positive shift about 30 mV compared to that of commercial Pt/C
(0.729 V), declaring a signally reduced absorption free energy of
oxygenic species and a faster reduction rate on the surface of catalysts.16 Beyond that, the electrochemical active specific
surface areas (ECSAs) of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600, Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3/C-700, and Pt/C are determined to be 81.4, 53.7,
and 64.0 m2 g–1 through normalizing the
charge integral of CV curves from 0.05 to 0.4 V to the total mass
of Pt.

The ORR polarization curves with deduction of the
background current
are exhibited in Figure 5d after pretreatment by repeating the potentials in the range of
−0.2–0.8 V for 20 cycles in order to eliminate surface
contamination. The ORR polarization curves were executed in the positive
direction from 0.3 to 1.1 V at a sweep rate of 20 mV s–1. Basically, the polarization curves of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts are at the right side of the commercial Pt/C catalyst,
revealing a positive shift in both onset potential and half-wave potential.
To be precise, the onset potentials of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600
and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalysts are determined to be
1.031 and 1.019 V, respectively, surpassing that of Pt/C (1.003 V)
by 28 and 16 mV, respectively. The half-wave potentials of Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3/C-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalysts
were also confirmed to be 0.929 and 0.913 V, showing 48 and 32 mV
higher than the commercial Pt/C catalyst (0.881 V). The LSV curves
exhibited in Figure 5d demonstrate that the alloying of Pt, Fe, Co, and Ni in ordered
configuration can expedite the kinetics of ORR and meanwhile lower
the overpotential needed for the reaction, making the reduction of
oxygen easier to occur and follow a more rapid dynamic procedure.

To better understand the utilization effects of Pt in the catalysts,
Tafel plots normalized to the total amount of Pt are presented in Figure 5e with the potential
between 0.83 and 1.02 V. It is clear that at an arbitrary potential,
the specific kinetic current of the Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600
catalyst is the highest and that of the commercial Pt/C catalyst is
the minimum, signifying that Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts
utilize the noble metal Pt to a maximum extent with excellent property
but at low amounts. In addition to this, the Tafel plot of the commercial
Pt/C catalyst shows a higher slope at an arbitrary current, declaring
that Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts can significantly improve
the reaction kinetics and lower the overpotential. Based on Tafel
plots, the mass activities (MAs) of different catalysts at 0.85 and
0.9 V are calculated. As shown in Figure 5f, the Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 catalyst
possesses the highest mass activity (MA) (3.189 mA μgPt–1 at 0.85 V, 0.605 mA μgPt–1 at 0.9 V), enhancing the activity by 11.8 and 6.6-fold
over that of commercial Pt/C (0.269 mA μgPt–1 at 0.85 V, 0.091 mA μgPt–1 at
0.9 V) at 0.85 and 0.9 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)
. Similarly, the MA of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalysts
(1.696 mA μgPt–1 at 0.85 V, 0.322
mA μgPt–1at 0.9 V) also surpasses
that of commercial Pt/C catalysts by 6.3 and 3.5 times, revealing
excellent electrocatalytic performance toward ORR. It is worth mentioning
that the calculated ECSA of commercial Pt/C (64.0 m2 g–1) is comparable to or in excess of that in the previous
work,12,32 and so does the MA (0.091 mA μgPt–1 at 0.9 V),18,27,40,41 which demonstrates
the reliability of the electrochemical measurements.

In order
to explore the influence of particle sizes and the ordering
effect on the holistic long-term durability of catalysts under acidic
conditions, the stability performance was evaluated through accelerated
durability tests (ADTs) between 0.6 and 1.0 V carried out in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at a sweep rate
of 50 mV s–1. As shown in Figure 6a,b, there is an inconspicuous difference
between the CV curves and ORR polarization curves of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts before and after ADTs, while the polarization
curves of commercial Pt/C exhibit a distinct separation. More accurately,
the degradation in half-wave potentials of different catalysts are
determined to be 20, 5, and 41 mV for Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600,
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700, and commercial Pt/C, respectively,
after 10 000 potential cycles. The Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C NPs exhibit the degradation in half-wave potentials far below
that of Pt/C, proving that the structurally ordered Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 NPs possess superior durability toward ORR under acidic conditions.
On this basis, the MAs of three different electrocatalysts before
and after 10 000 potential cycles are calculated, as shown
in Figure 6c. To be
exact, the remaining MAs of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600, Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3/C-700, and commercial Pt/C catalysts are determined
to be 58, 83, and 44%, respectively, after 10 000 potential
cycles at 0.9 V (Table S5). Figure 6d shows the specific activities
(SAs) of electrocatalysts before and after ADTs at 0.9 V, where the
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalyst stands out for its distinctive
stability performance. The decays in SA of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600, Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700, and Pt/C catalysts are
determined to be 21.5, 1.5, and 41.5%, severally (Table S6). The mass and specific activities of catalysts at
0.85 V after ADTs are also revealed in Figure S7, where Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 still exhibits the
optimal durability. The Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalyst
reveals the minimal decay in half-wave potential, MA, and SA, while
the decays of Pt/C reach the maximum, which further verifies the superior
stability of structurally ordered Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C NPs
toward ORR than Pt/C catalysts.

curves of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts and commercial Pt/C

10 000 cycles. Contrast diagrams of (c) mass activities and
(d) specific activities of catalysts before and after ADTs at 0.9
V.

On the whole, the enhanced electrocatalytic
performance of Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3 NPs toward ORR can be interpreted as the following
aspects: electronic structural modification and the ordering effect.
Specifically, the integration of transition metals Fe, Co, and Ni
into Pt alters the electronic structures of Pt and generates a strain
effect, which remarkably enhances ORR activity.42 Furthermore, under high-temperature and reducing atmosphere
environments, the disordered alloy transforms into cubic L12-ordered structure spontaneously, which powerfully restrains the
dissolution of transition metals in acid solution and makes the catalysts
chemically stable.26 Because of smaller
particle sizes, Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 NPs have a higher
proportion of surface atoms. The ECSAs data shown in Table S3 also declare that Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600
exhibits more electrocatalytic active sites, which eventually generates
the supreme electrocatalytic activity toward ORR. However, in the
nanometer scale, NPs with smaller particle sizes tend to show a decreased
surface percentage of (111) sites and an increased percentage of edge
sites, which may reduce the SA as a consequence.43 Meanwhile, NPs with smaller particle sizes have a higher
surface energy, which provides impetus for particle aggregation and
growth. Figure S8 exhibits the TEM images
of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-600 and Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 catalysts after ADTs of 10 000 cycles. Apparently,
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-600 NPs exhibit a conspicuous aggregation
behavior, and distribution of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-600 NPs on
the carbon support becomes nonuniform during the ADT period. In contrast,
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-700 NPs remain its particle sizes and show
a more homogeneous distribution on the carbon support. The aggregation
and growth of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-600 NPs is responsible for
the relatively pronounced decay in activity after ADTs. Moreover,
Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3-700 NPs exhibit a higher degree of ordering
seen from the obvious (110) ordered peak in XRD patterns, which dramatically
restrains the dissolution of transition metals in acid solution. As
a result, Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C-700 NPs reveal the most superior
stability after ADTs because of the balance between the ordered chemical
structure and particle sizes.

3 Conclusions
In conclusion,
this work demonstrates a facile and effective method
for synthesis of quaternary structurally ordered L12-Pt(Fe,
Co, Ni)3 NPs supported on carbon through the spray dehydration
method on the solid surface accompanied by an annealing process. The
orderly spatial configuration is investigated and confirmed, declaring
the successful synthesis of novel structurally ordered alloy phase
in the type of PtM3. On account of the chemically ordered
structure together with electronic structural modification of Pt arising
from the coalescence of transition metals, Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C catalysts show boosted ORR activity (maximal MA 6.6 times higher
than Pt/C at 0.9 V) and excellent stability performance (minimal loss
of 17% in MA and 1.5% in SA). The stability behavior of catalysts
is systematically explored to be tightly dependent on the coaction
of particle sizes and ordering degree of NPs. The Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3/C nanocatalysts reported in this work exploit Pt to the maximum
extent to guarantee the remarkable electrocatalytic properties, serving
as highly competitive substitutes for traditional catalysts in the
stoichiometric forms of Pt3M and PtM. Beyond that, compared
with the extensively adopted chemosynthesis method at present, the
facile and effective synthetic strategy in this work can provide a
fresh perspective on synthesizing late-model cost-effective Pt-based
nanocatalysts for PEMFCs.

Chloroplatinic acid (H2PtCl6·6H2O), ferric nitrate (Fe(NO3)3·9H2O), cobalt nitrate (Co(NO3)2·6H2O), nickel nitrate (Ni(NO3)2·6H2O), and PVP were purchased
from Aladdin Reagent Co., Ltd. Vulcan XC-72R carbon black was purchased
from Cabot Corporation. Nafion (5%) was purchased from DuPont and
commercial Pt/C (20% Pt loading supported on XC-72R carbon black with
an average size of 3 nm) was obtained from Johnson Matthey.

4.2 Synthesis of Pt(Fe, Co, Ni)3 NPs
Before
the synthesis, the amount of all the chemicals and materials
was calculated. Then, 300 mg of H2PtCl6·6H2O and a predetermined amounts, 234.0 mg of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O, 168.6 mg of Co(NO3)2·6H2O, and 168.4 mg of Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were mixed and dissolved in 40
mL of deionized water to ensure the proportions of Pt, Fe, Co, and
Ni atoms in the solution are the same. For better dispersion of NPs
on the carbon support, carbon black was added in advance. A specific
amount of Vulcan XC-72R carbon black (853.92 mg) was added to achieve
a 20 wt % alloy loading on the carbon support. PVP of the same mass
as carbon black (853.92 mg) was dissolved in the suspension as well
to prevent conglomeration of NPs and the carbon support; then, the
suspension went through an ultrasonic processing for 40 min. After
all these, the spray dehydration method was carried out by squirting
the well-dispersed suspension onto a quartz plate at a temperature
of 300 °C. As the solvent evaporated fairly soon on the surface
of the quartz plate, the mixed precursor at the molecular level was
acquired on the quartz plate. The remaining mixture was collected
and then gradually heated in the tube furnace while pumping all the
time to remove vestigial PVP as PVP will volatilize under high-temperature
conditions and vacuum environment. In the end, the desired NPs were
obtained by annealing the precursor at 600 and 700 °C for 1 h
under a H2 atmosphere.

4.3 Synthesis
of PtAuCuNi NPs
The same
synthetic strategy was applied to prepare PtAuCuNi/C NPs where H2PtCl6·6H2O, HAuCl4·3H2O, Cu(NO3)2·6H2O, and
Ni(NO3)2·6H2O were employed
and then they underwent the spray dehydration method and an annealing
process.

4.4 Morphological, Structural, and Elemental Characterization
The structural analysis of NPs was carried out using an XRD (Rigaka
Ultima IV multipurpose XRD) with Cu Κα radiation at the
rate of 5° min–1 within the range of 20°–90°.
The magnetic properties of NPs were carried out by using a Superconducting
Quantum Interface Device (SQUID; Quantum Design) with the magnetic
field from 0 to 2 T at 300 K. The morphological information was obtained
by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and HR-TEM (JEM-2100HR JEOL)
operated at 200 kV. The STEM–EDX elemental mapping images were
acquired by using an FEI Tecnai F-20 microscope (FEI TF-20; FEI) operated
at 200 kV. The quantitative analysis of the element content for Pt,
Fe, Co, and Ni was detected by ICP-AES (ICP-AES; Thermo Jarrell Ash).

4.5 Electrochemical Measurements
The
working electrodes were prepared by dispersing 4 mg of catalysts into
2 mL of specially formulated solution consisting of deionized water,
isopropanol, and Nafion (5%) with a volume ratio of 3:1:0.05. Then
the suspension went through an ultrasonic processing for 40 min to
obtain the well-dispersed catalyst ink. The catalyst ink (25 μL)
was afterward loaded on the glassy carbon electrode with a diameter
of 5 mm. Finally, the uniform catalyst film over the entire glassy
carbon surface was acquired by rotating the glassy carbon electrode
with a speed of 300 rpm until the ink dried out completely. The electrochemical
measurements were carried out using an electrochemical workstation
(CHI 660D; CH Instruments) together with a RDE (Pine Research Instrumentation).
A platinum wire was used as the counter electrode, while an Ag/AgCl
electrode filled with 3 M KCl solution was employed as the reference
electrode. The CV curves were carried out between 0.05 and 1.1 V versus
RHE at 50 mV s–1 in N2-saturated 0.1
M HClO4 solution. The ORR activities were then measured
in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution at a rate
of 20 mV s–1. The kinetic current density JK can be achieved by the K–L equation  J is the actually measured
current density and JL is the diffusion
limited current density. Meanwhile, JL can be expressed by the Levich equation  where n is the electron transfer
number; F is Faraday’s constant (96 485
C mol–1); CO is the
concentration of molecular oxygen in 0.1 M HClO4 solution
(1.2 × 10–6 mol cm–3); D is the diffusion coefficient of O2 in 0.1 M
HClO4 solution (1.93 × 10–5 cm2 s–1); ν is the viscosity of the electrolyte
(1.01 × 10–2 cm2 s–1); and ω is the angular frequency of rotation.18,44

The ECSAs are determined by normalizing the charge integral
of CV curves from 0.05 to 0.4 V versus RHE to the mass of Pt. For
the ADTs, 10 000 potential cycles of consecutive CV scanning
were conducted in the range of 0.6–1.0 V at a rate of 50 mV
s–1 in O2-saturated 0.1 M HClO4 solution. All of the electrochemical measurements were accomplished
at room temperature, and all the polarization curves were converted
to be relative to RHE after taking into consideration the electrode
potentials and pH of the solution.
