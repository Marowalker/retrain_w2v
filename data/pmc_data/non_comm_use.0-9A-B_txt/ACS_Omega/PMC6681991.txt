Although
nanoparticles of heavy metal xanthates and their hydrosols
can play important roles in froth flotation, environmental issues,
analytics, and manufacturing of metal sulfide nanocomposites, they
have received little attention. We studied colloidal solutions and
immobilized particles prepared via interaction of aqueous lead nitrate
with alkyl xanthates applying UV–vis absorption spectroscopy,
dynamic light scattering, zeta potential measurement, thermogravimetry
analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman scattering,
X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission
electron microscopy. The hydrodynamic diameter of colloidal particles
of Pb(SSCOR)2 decreased from 500 to 50 nm with an increase
in the alkyl radical length and the initial xanthate to lead ratio
(X/Pb); the zeta potential magnitude varied similarly, although it
remained negative. The effect of pH in the range of 4.5–11
was minor, but the colloids produced using excess of Pb2+ in alkaline media were close to PbX and decomposed much easier than
PbX2. The uptake of lead xanthates on supports was generally
low because of negative charges of the colloids; however, 50–100
nm thick PbX2 films were deposited on PbS and SiO2 from the media of X/Pb < 2 and pH < 9 because of preadsorption
of Pb2+, while nanorods formed on highly oriented pyrolytic
graphite.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Heavy
metal salts of xantic acid (the O-ester of carbonodithionic
acid) M(SSCOR)n, where M is a metal cation,
R is an alkyl group, and n = 1, 2, or 3, are utilized
in the production of cellulose, rubber, pesticides, lubricants, and
so forth, for example.1−4 Xanthates of lead and transition metals are prospective precursors
to nanoparticles and films of metal sulfides, allowing a low-temperature,
between 100 and 200 °C, in situ preparation of nanoparticulate
sulfides within the polymer matrix for photovoltaics, sensors, and
so forth.5−14 Xanthates have been proposed as capping ligands in the synthesis
of metal nanoparticles and self-assembled monolayers alternative to
thiols.14−16 Xanthates of alkali metals are widely used for the
precipitation and separation of heavy metals in mineral processing,
hydrometallurgy, water treatment, analytical practice,1,17,18 and, first of all, as collectors
in froth flotation of metal sulfide ores.19 Water-insoluble xanthates of lead, copper, and some other metals
likely emerge as colloidal or surface species in the reaction between
the xanthate collector and aqueous cations in the flotation slurries,
and their interaction with mineral surfaces is important for understanding
the flotation mechanisms and performance.19−30 The ultrafine xanthate entities are also possible carriers of lead
and heavy metals in wastewaters and natural surface waters, along
with metal sulfide colloids31−37 or as their precursors. It was demonstrated36,37 that the yield of sulfide mineral ultrafines in the mineral processing
is not negligible, and their total amounts can be very significant
because of large volumes of the ores; moreover, the concentrations
of Pb-bearing colloids in environmental waters can be higher than
that of aqueous lead ions.31−33

Although there are a number
of studies on the structure and behavior
of metal xanthates,1,12,38−47 colloidal and nanoscale metal xanthates having the characteristics
different from the bulk materials, which can arise in the technological
and environmental media, have received little attention. Recently,
we examined the formation of colloidal copper xanthate particles in
the reaction of aqueous solutions of cupric sulfate and various potassium
xanthates47 and found, in particular, that
CuX nanoparticles incorporated about 15 wt % of dixanthogen; the colloids
produced with excessive xanthate had a high negative zeta potential
magnitude, lower diameter, and higher aggregative stability than the
ones charged positively at the overstoichiometric excess of cupric
ions. The aim of the current research was to study colloidal and immobilized
products of the interaction of aqueous Pb2+ cations and
various potassium xanthates under conditions, which are of interest
for mineral processing, synthesis of PbS-based nanomaterials, and
environmental concerns. Serious consideration was given to the effect
of pH and to the species arising at high pHs, in particular, possible
formation and behavior of lead hydroxy xanthate.20−25

2 Results
2.1 DLS and Zeta Potential
Studies
Figure 1 shows the average
hydrodynamic diameters (Zav) determined
with dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potentials of the colloids,
which were produced by mixing the solutions of lead nitrate and potassium
xanthate with different alkyl radicals, as a function of the xanthate
to lead (X/Pb) molar ratio. The experiments were performed without
adjustment of pH that slightly increased with the growing proportion
of xanthates, for example, from pH 4.4 to 5.2 for n-butyl xanthate, mainly at X/Pb > 2 (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The hydrodynamic diameter ranged
from about 50 to 500 nm; it slowly reduced with a decrease in the
excess of Pb2+, fell in the vicinity of X/Pb = 2 that corresponds
to the stoichiometry of the reaction  and remained almost constant at higher xanthate
concentrations. A negative correlation between Zav and the size of the xanthate alkyl radical is very apparent
for the xanthate-deficient solutions with X/Pb < 2. It is noteworthy
that the hydrodynamic diameter of lead amyl xanthate particles (200–150
nm) only slightly decreased over the whole range of the X/Pb ratio.

Figure 1 Effect
of the initial xanthate to lead molar ratio on the hydrodynamic
diameter (Zav) and zeta potential of colloids
formed with ethyl-, iso-propyl-, iso-butyl-, n-butyl-,
and amyl xanthates at naturally occurring pHs and room temperature.

Zeta potentials of the colloids
were negative even at a large excess
of Pb2+ and also showed a sudden change near the X/Pb ratio
of 2. However, the effect of alkyl chains on zeta potential values
was not straightforward, probably due to structural differences of
the lead xanthates.12,39,40,42 Nevertheless, a comparison of the effects
of alkyl chains and the X/Pb ratios on Zav and zeta potential suggests that the surface charge and aggregation
of the particles are not a major factor affecting the diameter of
the colloids.

Further results are presented for lead n-butyl
xanthate; the data for other xanthates of lead were generally similar.
The hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the Pb(BX)2 colloids prepared using stoichiometric or excessive quantities of
xanthate weakly depend on pH (Figure 2), except for instabilities at high pHs likely caused
by hydrolysis.41 The behavior of the reaction
media with the BX– to Pb2+ proportion
of 1, that is, with a rather big overstoichiometric amount of lead,
is more complicated. The pronounced Zav maximum and the reduction of negative zeta potential magnitude to
less than 10 mV at pH 6–8 imply aggregation of the colloidal
particles induced by a decrease of the surface charge owing to the
adsorption of Pb2+ cations. Moreover, as it will be demonstrated
below, these phenomena at higher pH can be rationalized in terms of
splitting off one xanthate ligand and fast partial decomposition of
the species formed (marked as PbBX), yielding lead sulfide. This is
visible with the naked eye as a sol darkening and then sedimentation
of a black PbS residue; a contribution of some lead hydroxide or basic
lead nitrate precipitates also cannot be ruled out.

Figure 2 Effect of pH on the hydrodynamic
diameter (Zav) and zeta potential of lead n-butyl xanthate
colloids prepared with the initial xanthate to Pb molar ratios of
1:1, 2:1, and 3:1.

Typically, PbX2 sols are stable for several hours at
least, with the size of the particles increased with time, particularly
at lower relative concentrations of xanthate (Figure 3a). Zav also
grows with an increase in temperature of the solutions, resulting
in the appearance of micrometer entities at the BX/Pb ratio of 1.
Furthermore, even at the stoichiometric reagent proportion of 2:1,
the dynamic scattering intensity reduces with time at the temperature
of 40 °C and higher (Figure 3c), indicating that the growth of Zav is accompanied by coagulation and precipitation of
the colloid and/or hydrolytic decomposition of lead xanthate. The
hydrodynamic diameter increases with increasing concentration of hydrosols;
nevertheless, the colloidal solutions of n-butyl
xanthate of lead remain quite stable at the lead concentration as
high as 10 mM at room temperature (Figure S2, Supporting Information).

2.2 UV–Vis
Absorption Spectroscopy
Figure 4 shows UV–vis
spectra collected from the aqueous solution of KBX and reaction media
with the BX/Pb ratios of 2 (pH 5) and 1 (pH 9.5). The spectrum of
potassium xanthate has absorption maxima at 227 and ∼300 nm,
which can be assigned to the n−σ* electron transition
in the C=S group and the π–π* transition
in the O–C–(S)S group, respectively.41,48,49 These maxima decreased, and new features
at 256 and 355 nm attributable to modified C–S bonds and C–S–Pb
bonding,40 respectively, emerge upon the
xanthate reaction with Pb2+ ions and persist during the
aging of the hydrosols. In the spectra of the media with BX/Pb = 1
at pH 9.5, the maximum at 300 nm is stronger and increases with time,
and the one at 380 nm is weaker than at the BX/Pb ratio of 2. These
differences may be interpreted in terms of a higher amount of free
xanthate yielded via hydrolysis of lead xanthate and a lower number
of Pb–S(S)–C– bonds because of a different composition
of the lead xanthate.

KBX and reaction media with the initial n-butyl xanthate

1:1 at pH 9.5 after 10 min (b,c) and 120 min (b′,c′)
at 20 °C, respectively.

2.3 Thermal Behavior of Deposited Lead Xanthates
The results of thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC) are presented in Figure 5 for lead n-butyl xanthates
precipitated from their hydrosols. The profiles recorded for Pb(BX)2 prepared with the different reagent ratios were very similar
and were in reasonable agreement with those reported previously.6−12 The decomposition of Pb(BX)2 to PbS as the final product
in the inert atmosphere starts at about 110 °C after the melting
point at 84 °C and proceeds in the liquid phase12 via a two-stage reaction with two peaks at the derivative
weight loss curves at 154 and 194 °C, corresponding to exo- and
endothermic processes. The total weight loss was about 51% that is
slightly larger than the theoretical value of 47.4%; this, as well
as slightly higher temperature of the decomposition offset as compared
with lead xanthates synthesized in nonaqueous media and reacted in
one stage,11,12 may be due to wetting of the
nanoparticulate material explored here. Interestingly, the reaction
in air proceeded practically in one stage with the weight loss of
49% and was completed at a lower temperature (Figure 5). The sample deposited from the medium with
the BX/Pb ratio of 1:1 (pH 9.5) began to decompose in the Ar atmosphere
at the temperature as low as 60 °C, that is, in the solid state,
in several exothermic stages with a weight loss of ∼6% before
the melting of minor Pb(BX)2 and about 24% more as the
reaction completed at ∼180 °C. The total weight loss of
∼30% is close to the loss of 32.6% expected for the transformation
of monodentate lead xanthate PbBX, or Pb[(SSCO)C4H9], to PbS as the solid product.

and DSC profiles for lead n-butyl xanthates precipitated
from the media with the BX/Pb ratios
of 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 (pH 5) heated in the inert Ar atmosphere, 3:1
heated in air, and 1:1 at pH 9.5 heated in Ar.

2.4 FTIR and Raman Spectroscopy
Fourier
transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Figure 6) of the Pb(BX)2 particles immobilized
from the hydrosols with pH 5 and the BX/Pb ratio varying from 1:1
to 3:1 were essentially similar and distinct from KBX; detailed interpretation
of the spectra can be found in refs.21,22,28,38,44,45 The main
change of the spectrum from the sample prepared at BX/Pb = 1 in the
alkaline solution of stationary pH = 9.5 is a shift of the peak at
1201 cm–1, which is due to antisymmetric stretch
vibration νas(COC), to 1182 cm–1, while the frequency of νas(SCS) remains almost
the same (∼1030 cm–1).

Figure 6 FTIR spectra of solid
potassium n-butyl xanthate
(KBX) and lead n-butyl xanthates precipitated from
the hydrosols with the BX/Pb ratios of 3:1, 2:1, and 1:1 (pH 5) and
of 1:1 (pH 9.5).

Raman scattering spectra
are given in Figure 7; it should be mentioned that the baseline
of the spectra is affected by sample fluorescence. The spectra showed
the main differences between the products of the reactions at pH 5
and 9.5 in the symmetric stretches νs(SCS) near 660
cm–1 and small shifts of the scissoring deformation
δas(SCS) at 385 cm–1 and symmetric
stretching νs(SCS) near 1044 cm–1.38,50,51 These findings
indicate some modification of Pb–SSCOC bonds, which, nevertheless,
were preserved in the substance produced with the deficit of xanthate
at high pH and are in accord with the PbBX composition.

(KBX) and lead n-butyl xanthates precipitated from
their hydrosols with the initial BX/Pb ratios of (b) 2:1 (pH 5) and

2.5 X-ray
Photoelectron Spectroscopy
Figure 8 represents
selected photoelectron spectra of lead butyl xanthates obtained using
the BX/Pb ratios of 2 (pH 5) and 1 (pH 9.5) in comparison with the
solid KBX reagent. Concentrations of elements and fitting details
for these and additional spectra are given in Table S1 (Supporting Information). The spectrum of KBX
shows the major S 2p3/2,1/2 doublet with a binding energy
(BE) of S 2p3/2 peak at 162.3 eV, implying that S atoms
are equivalent; minor contributions at 163.2 and 168.2 eV are probably
due to an impurity of thiosulfate. The O 1s band shows the maximum
from oxygen in xanthate at 533.4 eV and a smaller one at 531.7 eV
attributable to an admixture of KOH.43 In
addition to the line from the alkyl radical in xanthate and possible
carbonaceous contaminations (285.0 eV), the C 1s spectra contain almost
equal maxima at 286.3 and 287.8 eV, corresponding to C* and C** atoms
in the −C*–O–C**–(S)S group, respectively.22−27,43

Figure 8 X-ray photoelectron spectra (normalized
in height) from solid potassium n-butyl xanthate
(KBX), lead n-butyl xanthates
deposited from their hydrosols with the initial BX/Pb ratios of (a)
2:1 (pH 5), (b) 1:1 (pH 9.5), and the sample (b) heated to (c) 50
and (d) 150 °C in the Ar atmosphere.

The C 1s spectrum from Pb(BX)2 is similar, but
the signal
of C** atoms is shifted to a lower BE of 287.4 eV, suggesting a higher
electron density at the atom because of binding of the dithionic group
to Pb2+ cations instead of K+. We observed single
S 2p (162.2 eV), Pb 4f (Pb 4f7/2 peak at 138.3 eV), and
O 1s (533.4 eV) components, with the S/Pb atomic ratio of ∼4
and the O/Pb ∼2 (Table S1), in agreement
with the Pb(BX)2 composition.22−27,43 The initial xanthate to lead
proportion in the media of pH 5 had no effect on the spectra. However,
for the xanthate to lead proportion of 1:1 at pH 9–10, both
the S/Pb and O/Pb atomic ratios were between 1 and 2. The S 2p spectra
could be better fitted with the band at 162.2 eV from S in xanthate
and the second smaller one at 160.6 eV from PbS, while the Pb 4f spectrum
can be fitted with components at 137.7 and 138.4 eV attributable to
PbS and lead xanthate and/or lead hydroxide, respectively. The total
content of oxygen increases about two times; in addition to the O
1s line of xanthate (533.4 eV), the strong maximum at ∼531
eV (70% of intensity) could be assigned to hydroxide OH species, and
a minor component at 529.5 eV originates from O2– in PbO or similar compounds. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Figure
S3, Supporting Information) revealed one
of such crystalline substances to be Pb13O8(OH)6(NO3)4.52 A shift of the C 1s component from 287.5 to 288.3 eV indicates a
lesser electron density (more positive charge) localized at the C**
atom, whereas the signal from C* atoms almost maintained its relative
intensity and position. The findings indicate that the sample is composed
of a mixture of PbBX, PbS as a product of its decay, and some Pb–O
compounds formed from unreacted aqueous lead cations, hydrolysis of
PbBX, or surface oxidation of PbS. The spectra acquired at liquid
nitrogen (LN) temperature to arrest the decay of lead xanthates showed
a higher concentration of S, smaller quantities of oxygen, and intensities
of the Pb 4f lines from lead oxide and hydroxides (Table S1), so the oxidized lead species appeared to form largely
ex situ.

The spectra of the Pb(BX)2 (not given in
figures) and
PbBX samples (Figure 8c,d, note the changes of the O/Pb and S/Pb proportions in Table S1) heated in the inert atmosphere under
conditions of the TGA experiment showed predominant signals of PbS
and minor amounts of remaining lead xanthate and Pb–O species
at both 50 and 150 °C in the case of PbBX.

2.6 Microscopic Studies
Transmission
electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction, and energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) examination (Supporting Information) revealed ∼5 nm particles of PbS and less contrast material
even in the case of Pb(BX)2 products. The decay of poorly
crystalline Pb(BX)2 was accelerated under the electron
beam, so reliable information was not obtained from TEM.

Figure 9 shows representative
tapping-mode atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of particles uptaken
from various hydrosols on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG),
silica (SiO2 on oxidized Si crystal), and mineral galena
(PbS). The number of the particles attached at the substrates from
the media with the BX/Pb ratios of 2 or higher is rather low, and
their lateral dimensions and height agree with the hydrodynamic diameters
50–100 nm determined using DLS. The quantities, size, and shape
of the particles deposited from the media with overstoichiometric
concentration of Pb2+ depend on pH and the nature of the
substrate. Rod-shaped particles were observed at hydrophobic inert
HOPG surfaces. Both nanoparticles of 50–100 nm, often slightly
elongated, and 50–100 nm thick irregular micrometer-scale islands
were found at SiO2 and PbS; the species can form two or
even more layers of ∼100 nm in thickness. The relative area
of the film was usually larger at galena; minor islands were also
found at HOPG treated with the solution with the BX/Pb ratio of 2
after aging the reaction media and longer deposition times.

Figure 9 Tapping-mode
AFM images (5 μm × 5 μm) of the products
immobilized on HOPG, SiO2, and PbS surfaces treated for
2 min by the aqueous media with the n-butyl xanthate
to lead molar ratios of 2, 1.5 at pH 5, and 1 at pH 9.5 (the concentration
of Pb was 0.1 mM, 20 °C).

Particles uptaken on HOPG from the medium with the BX/Pb
ratio
of 1 and pH 9.5 were mainly rod-shaped but rarer and smaller than
those formed at pH 5. A small number of particles of 100–300
nm in diameter at silica became smaller with time upon their drying
and likely decomposition of PbBX to PbS. At galena, nanometer-scale
surface roughness and particles seem to be products of oxidation of
the PbS surface53−55 rather than lead xanthate entities, whose quantity
was negligible.

3 Discussion
3.1 Formation of Lead Xanthate Nanoparticles
The direct
interaction of lead cations with xanthate anions X– produces colloidal nanoparticles of PbX2 composition
at pH ranging from 4 to 9 regardless of the X– to
Pb2+ ratios. Although the magnitude of zeta potential
depends on the ratio showing the typical curve shape with a sharp
decrease nearby the stoichiometry point, the potential remained negative
even at the large excess of the cation in contrast to copper xanthate
nanoparticles (in fact, a composite CuX/X2),46,47 whose surface charge changed its sign near the X–/Cu2+ = 2. The hydrodynamic diameter of the colloids depends
not only on zeta potential and aggregation of particles but also on
the nature of alkyl radicals and the structural factors12 related with the hydrophobicity and solubility
of Pb xanthates. These colloids show rather high chemical and aggregative
stability during many hours at ambient temperature and pH values typical,
particularly, for the flotation of lead-bearing ores, and their occurrence
should be taken into account in the wastewater treatment processes.

The hydrosols formed with overstoichiometric cations at pH higher
than ∼9 exhibit a very different behavior. It has been proposed
on the basis of thermodynamic and mechanistic consideration20 that basic lead xanthates Pb(OH)X form in such
alkaline slurries. Experimentally, the presence of Pb(OH)BX on galena
treated with lead-saturated n- and i-butyl xanthate solutions of pH 9.2 has been suggested from the ratio
of ∼2 of corresponding XPS S/Pb signals,24,25 although the results of time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy25 were not conclusive. The spectroscopic, XRD,
and TGA data in the current research imply that the composition of
the colloidal particles was PbBX, rather than Pb(OH)BX, with an admixture
of basic lead nitrate, lead hydroxide, and PbS formed upon aging and
drying the solution. The species is also distinct from an intermediate
Pb(SH)BX, which has been proposed12 to
form in the thermal decomposition of Pb(BX)2, via breakaway
of one xanthate ligand; this requires the S/Pb ratio to be 3, but
that is not the case here. It is interesting to note that the distortions
of the chemical bonds observed in the >C–O–C–
group are large and may be indicative of additional Pb–O bonding,
including polymerization; the composition and structure of “PbBX”
need further investigation. However, the “PbBX” species
has much less thermal stability than normal lead xanthates PbX2 and starts to decompose to PbS in the inert atmosphere at
the temperature as low as 60 °C in the solid state in contrast
to Pb(BX)2 and other metal xanthates which start decomposing
after the melting. This could be of interest, for example, for a low-temperature
preparation of polymer composites incorporating metal sulfide nanoparticles.

3.2 Immobilization of Lead Xanthate Nanoparticles
Colloidal lead xanthates spontaneously arisen in the flotation
slurries could interact with mineral surfaces and affect their floatability;
the uptake of the lead species is also important for environmental
issues. The number of immobilized nanoparticles of PbX2 was low (Figure 9) when the solutions contained excessive xanthate and the substrates
were negatively charged that is typical for metal sulfides (galena,
etc.), silica, and many other gangue minerals. Consequently, the effect
of PbX2 on flotation should be insignificant, and floatability
of galena is determined by the chemisorbed xanthate, as it has been
established in previous studies.19,23−26 When the aqueous medium was enriched in lead cations, we observed
the micrometer-scale layers composed of PbX2 nanoparticles,
which covered large areas, probably because adsorption of Pb2+ induced a positive surface charge of the supports. This mechanism
is inactive at inert HOPG with a small number of surface groups for
lead cations. Instead, spatially nonuniform adsorption of cations
onto lead xanthate nanoparticles may be a reason behind the formation
of rod-shaped particles.56 The situation
reverses again at high pH when the number of OH– groups on the mineral surface increases, while aqueous lead cations
are bounded in anionic hydroxide complexes or precipitated, so the
layers of immobilized nanoparticles do not emerge (Figure 9). Nevertheless, the galena
surface becomes essentially hydrophobic under these conditions according
to contact angle measurement (data are not presented here). The layers
of immobilized lead xanthate nanoparticles can be used, for example,
as a precursor for controlled deposition of PbS films or other materials.

4 Conclusions
Colloidal particles of lead xanthates
formed via direct interaction
of aqueous lead cations and various xanthates have the PbX2 composition and the hydrodynamic diameter from 50 to 500 nm. The
diameter decreases with the increasing length of alkyl radicals and
the xanthate to lead molar ratio, with an abrupt fall at the stoichiometric
composition. Zeta potential behaves similarly but remains negative
under all the experimental conditions in contrast to copper xanthates.
The characteristics of PbX2 colloids are insignificantly
affected by pH < 10, except for the species produced with a big
overstoichiometric content of Pb2+. The composition of
colloidal particles formed in the alkaline media of pH = 9.5 with
the Pb excess is close to PbX but not Pb(OH)X as suggested earlier.
The “PbX” species easily decayed, yielding PbS in aqueous
media and air; under heating in an inert atmosphere, a solid-state
reaction started at 50–60 °C, while the solid PbX2 decomposed at the temperatures above 100 °C after the
melting. The decomposition of the precipitated PbX2 colloids
is shifted to slightly higher temperatures in comparison with the
bulk material prepared in nonaqueous media12 and proceeds in two stages. The uptake of the nanoparticles of lead
xanthates onto HOPG, PbS, and SiO2 surfaces from the solutions
having excess of xanthate was rather low because of the negative charges
of both the PbX2 nanoparticles and supports. This is also
valid for “PbX” particles prepared with the BX/Pb ratio
of 1 at pH 9.5. The PbX2 colloids from the media with the
BX/Pb ratios less than 2 and pH < 9 spontaneously form micrometer-size
islands on PbS and SiO2, probably due to adsorption of
excessive aqueous Pb2+ cations inducing a positive charge
of the support. The thickness of the islands of 50–100 nm correlates
with the diameter of PbX2 nanoparticles. Rod-shaped particles
but not the islands deposit onto HOPG, possibly because a low density
of surface functional groups binding Pb2+ on HOPG and spatially
inhomogeneous adsorption of lead cations onto (immobilized) PbX2 entities promoted their coalescence to nanorods. These findings
can be interesting for controlling the deposition of lead xanthates
on various supports including minerals in flotation and materials
science and should be taken into account for water treatment and environmental
issues.

5 Experimental Section
5.1 Materials
and Preparation Methods
Potassium ethyl xanthate (CH3CH2OCSSK), isopropyl
xanthate (C2H6CHOCSSK), n-butyl
xanthate, isobutyl xanthate (C3H7CH2OCSSK), and amyl xanthate (C4H9CH2OSSK) of 95% purity purchased from “Volzhsky Orgsynthese”
(Russia) were recrystallized two times in acetone and kept frozen
in the solid state; the fresh solutions of the reagents were prepared
using deionized water (∼10 MΩ·cm) immediately before
the experiment. Lead nitrate and other chemicals were of analytical
grade and were used as received. In a typical procedure, 1 mL of Pb(NO3)2 solution (0.3 mM) and 1 mL of potassium xanthate
solution, whose concentration was varied from 0.15 to 8 mM in order
to obtain a predetermined xanthate to Pb ratio, were added to 1 mL
of water and agitated for 5 min in a thermostated glass; the pH was
adjusted to a required value using 1 mM KOH solution when necessary.
The hydrosols of “PbX” species were obtained by mixing
the solutions of Pb(NO3)2, potassium n-butyl xanthate (KBX), and KOH in the molar proportions
1:1:1; the pH of the medium formed was stabilized at 9.5. Then the
reaction solutions were loaded into a cell for UV–vis absorption
spectroscopy, DLS, or zeta potential studies.

5.2 Thermogravimetry
Analysis
The samples
of lead xanthates for TGA were precipitated from the 1 mM colloidal
solutions by centrifugation at 10g for 10 min, washed
with water by decantation, and dried on a filter paper in air at room
temperature. TGA and DTA were performed in the range from the ambient
temperature to 900 °C using a STA449 F1 Jupiter instrument (Netzsch)
at the heating rate of 10 °C/min in argon at a gas flow rate
of 50 mL/min; some experiments were also conducted in air.

spectra were collected in a thermostatic quartz cell with the optical
path of 1 cm employing an Evolution 300 spectrometer (Thermo Scientific)
or a Shimadzu UV 3600 instrument. The mean hydrodynamic diameter (Zav) and zeta potential of the colloids were
determined by DLS using a Zetasizer Nano ZS spectrometer (Malvern
Instruments Ltd., UK) at the scattering angle 173° in a folded
polystyrene cell or polycarbonate cell with Pd electrodes after about
10 min reaction, unless otherwise stated.

FTIR spectra were
recorded from the lead xanthates precipitated and dried as described
above in KBr pellets with a Bruker VECTOR 22 Fourier spectrometer.
The Raman spectra were recorded in the backscattering geometry using
a HORIBA Jobin-Yvon T64000 spectrometer equipped with an LN-cooled
charge-coupled device detector in subtractive dispersion mode utilizing
Ar+-ion laser Spectra-Physics Stabilite 2017 (514.5 nm,
1 mW) as an excitation light source.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) studies were performed using
a hydrosol dried at HOPG and gently rinsed with water. The spectra
were acquired using a SPECS spectrometer equipped with a PHOIBOS 150
MCD-9 analyzer at electron take-off angle 90° employing monochromatic
Al Kα radiation (1486.6 eV) of an X-ray tube operated at 200
W. The analyzer pass energy was 10 eV for high-resolution scans and
20 eV for survey spectra. The experiments were conducted at room temperature,
and several samples were frozen in the lock chamber and measured at
−150 °C to reduce their decay. Electron flood gun was
employed to eliminate inhomogeneous electrostatic charging of the
samples; the C 1s peak at 284.45 eV from HOPG was used as a reference.
The high-resolution spectra were fitted after subtraction of Shirley-type
background with Gaussian–Lorentzian peak profiles, including
Pb 4f7/2,5/2 and S 2p3/2,1/2 doublets with the
spin–orbit splitting of 4.85 and 1.19 eV and the branching
ratios of 0.75 and 0.5, respectively, using CasaXPS software.

TEM, EDX analysis, and selected area electron diffraction (SAED)
characterization were carried out using a JEM 2100 instrument (JEOL)
operated at an accelerating voltage of 200 kV. For examination, a
droplet of the aqueous media, typically after 10 min reaction, was
placed onto a Cu grid with a cover layer of amorphous carbon and allowed
to dry in ambient air. Tapping-mode AFM investigations were conducted
in air with a multimode Solver P47 device equipped with a 14 mm scanner
(NT-MDT, Russia) using silicon cantilevers with a resonant frequency
of about 150 kHz. The samples were prepared by air-drying of a sol
droplet on HOPG, SiO2, or natural PbS (galena) supports
and water-rinsing.
