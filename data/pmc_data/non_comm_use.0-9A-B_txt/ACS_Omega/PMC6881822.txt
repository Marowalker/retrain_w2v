Metal halide perovskites exhibit
small exciton binding energy,
which leads to a low electron–hole capture rate for radiative
recombination and accordingly decreases the luminescence efficiency.
Reducing the thickness of the perovskite film or the size of the perovskite
crystal is found to be an effective method to spatially confine the
electrons and holes to promote the bimolecular radiative recombination.
Here, we fabricate CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites, applicable for light emission diodes, by a simple
self-assembly method. We effectively reduce the critical size of the
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals in the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites by adding a certain amount of dimethyl
sulfoxide into the perovskite precursor solution. Accordingly, the
photoluminescence quantum yield of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites increased from 56 to 91% due to the
quantum size effect. In situ observation of the growth of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites reveals that
the reduction of the CsPbBr3 crystal size is due to the
change of the chemical reaction speed during the two-step growth process
of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites.

Introduction
Metal
halide perovskites attract great attention owing to their
facile solution processing, high color purity, tunable bandgap, and
large and balanced electron and hole mobilities.1−6 These unique properties make them promising in photoelectronics,
such as color-conversion phosphors in white light emission diodes
(LEDs), electroluminescent materials in LEDs, and as gain materials
in lasers.7−9 In recent years, the external quantum efficiency
(EQE) of perovskite LEDs has reached more than 20%.10−12

Two strategies
have been developed for fabricating perovskite emission
devices i.e., (1) spin-coating and (2) deposition of bulk perovskite
films. In the first method, highly luminescent presynthesized colloidal
perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) are utilized to deposit the film by
the spin-coating technique. In the second approach, perovskite precursor
solutions are required for the deposition of bulk perovskite films.
In both the strategies, decreasing the grain size of perovskite materials
is important due to the small exciton binding energy in three-dimensional
perovskites. Thus, reducing the grain size of ultrathin perovskite
films or small perovskite NCs can spatially confine the electrons
and holes to promote the electron–hole capture rate of radiative
recombination. Wang et al. synthesized thin granular CsPbBr3 films by introducing trifluoroacetate anions such that an external
quantum efficiency (EQE) of 10.5% was achieved.13 In addition, the value of EQE is enhanced due to the confining
growth rate of low leveled crystallites (∼10 nm) by adding
ammonium halides to the perovskite precursor solution.14

Like controlling grain size, surface passivation
is another important
method to reduce nonradiative recombination to enhance the EQE of
the device. Lin et al prepared the CsPbBr3/MABr quasi-core/shell
structure film. The MABr shell effectively passivated the nonradiative
defects and improved the performance of the device.10 In the case of the perovskite-nanocrystal-based device,
Zeng and co-workers controlled the perovskite nanocrystal surface
through employing organic–inorganic hybrid ligands and demonstrated
CsPbBr3 nanocrystal-based LEDs with an impressive peak
EQE of over 16%.15 The perovskite NCs can
also be passivated by coating a shell material on the surface, such
as poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene, and silica.16−19 In our previous work, we prepared CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites by a simple self-assembly method,
in which Cs4PbBr6 played an important role in
passivation and developed a white LED using the nanocomposites.20

In this paper, we effectively reduced
the critical size of the
CsPbBr3 NCs in the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites by adding an appropriate amount of dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) into the perovskite precursor solution. Utilizing
the effect of DMSO on the solubility of lead (II) bromide (PbBr2) and cesium bromide (CsBr) in the solvent, the growth of
CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites can
be precisely controlled. Accordingly, the photoluminescence quantum
yield (PLQY) of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites increased from 56 to 91% by reducing the size of
embedded CsPbBr3 in host Cs4PbBr6 materials.

Results and Discussion
Microstructures and Optical
Properties of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 Nanocomposites
The microstructures and
absorption and photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites were investigated. Figure S1 shows the microstructures and optical
properties of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites
formed in pure N,N-dimethylformamide
(DMF). high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) images
show the matrix structure clearly, with CsPbBr3 nanocrystals
embedded in Cs4PbBr6 host materials (Figure S1a). The absorption spectrum exhibits
a strong peak at 315 nm and an absorption edge at 505 nm (Figure S1b). The PL spectrum displays a weak
peak at 340 nm and a strong narrow peak at 517 nm (Figure S1b). As discussed in previous work, the PL peak near
340 nm is related to Cs4PbBr6 and the strong
PL peak near 517 nm originates from embedded CsPbBr3 NCs.20

The formation mechanism of the nanocomposites
also follows the model proposed previously that it is grown by a two-step
chemical reaction driven by the difference of ion concentrations of
Cs+ and Pb2+ ions.20 The solubility of CsBr is very low in the solvent of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), whereas it is much higher
for PbBr2.7 Therefore, the ion
concentration of Pb2+ is much higher and the Pb-rich phase
of CsPbBr3 is formed in the first stage when CsBr and PbBr2 (CsBr/PbBr2 = 4:1, molar ratio) are loaded into
DMF solvent. With the consumption of PbBr2, Cs+ concentration is higher in the second stage and therefore CsPbBr3 is converted into the Cs-rich phase of Cs4PbBr6 and CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites
are produced when newly formed Cs4PbBr6 are
grown on the surface of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals.

Effect of Solvent
on the Growth of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 Nanocomposites
We first investigated
the coordination and solubility behavior of the reactants in DMF and
DMSO. Figure 1a displays
the evolution of the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the solids
obtained from the solvent with different DMSO ratios. To conveniently
depict the ratio of DMSO and DMF, we named the mixed solvent DMSO-X in the following discussions, where X represents the particular volume of DMSO in the mixed solvent with
a volume of 2 mL. In the case of DMSO-0, all of the diffraction peaks
are associated with PbBr2(DMF).21 The peaks of PbBr2(DMF) disappear upon increasing the
DMSO ratio from 0% (DMSO-0) to 7.5% (DMSO-0.15), whereas the peaks
associated with the PbBr2(DMSO)2 complex appear,
and upon further increasing the ratio of DMSO to 15% (DMSO-0.3), there
is no change observed in DMSO-0.15.21 Compared
to PbBr2(DMF), the complexity of PbBr2(DMSO)2 is preferentially formed in the mixed system of DMSO and
DMF. Except for the larger coordination number in PbBr2(DMSO)2, the Pb–O bond length is 2.386 Å in
PbBr2(DMSO)2, which is smaller than the value
of 2.431 Å in PbBr2(DMF), indicating that DMSO has
a stronger coordination ability with PbBr2 than DMF.21 The appearance of a characteristic absorption
peak of PbBr2(DMSO)2 and the blue shift of the
absorption edge in solvent DMSO-0.08 (Figure S2) indicates that the PbBr2(DMSO)2 coordination
is first formed in the solution.21 In addition,
we also studied the coordination behavior of CsBr in the mixed solvent
using the same experimental method. It can be seen from Figure S3 that all of the diffraction peaks correspond
to pure CsBr, which means that CsBr cannot coordinate with DMSO and
DMF. However, the dissolution experiments show that the solubility
of CsBr is gradually increased with increasing DMSO ratio (shown in Figure 1b). The different
coordination behavior of PbBr2 and dissolution behavior
of CsBr in the mixed precursor solutions must have an important influence
on the chemical reaction during the preparation of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites.

Figure 1 (a) XRD patterns of pure
PbBr2 or complex formed in
different solvents. The data are obtained by sequentially dissolving
PbBr2 into the DMF/DMSO solvent, evaporating the solvent,
and measuring the crystal structure of the solids obtained. (b) Solubility
curve of CsBr in mixed DMF–DMSO solution.

We investigate the effect of solvent on the growth of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites by in situ
observing the growth of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites in the solvent of DMSO-X and
characterizing the products obtained with different reaction times. Figure 2 shows the photographs
taken at different times during the reaction process and the XRD patterns
of the solid products obtained by centrifuging the corresponding dispersion.
Here, the sample (DMSO-0) exhibits an orange-colored dispersion and
precipitates with a reaction time of 3 min. XRD data obtained for
the precipitate reveal that the product consists of CsPbBr3 and undissolved CsBr (Figure 2b). Upon further increasing the reaction time to 5 min, a
light yellow precipitate starts to appear at the bottom of the tube
associated with green emission under ultraviolet (UV) irradiation
and is shown in Figure 2c. The luminescent precipitate is determined to be CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites based on the XRD results
(shown in Figure 2d)
and the research in our previous work.20 The production of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites is enhanced, and no observable diffraction peaks
of CsPbBr3 have been noticed in the XRD patterns, when
the reaction time is more than 30 min. The results demonstrate the
two-step formation process of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites, as revealed in our previous work.20 By comparing the photographs and XRD patterns
for the samples prepared with different DMSO contents but with the
same reaction time, we find that the DMSO can effectively accelerate
the transformation speed from CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6. A drastic color transition from the orange CsPbBr3 precipitate to the light yellow CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 precipitate is observed for the case of DMSO-0.15
when the reaction time is within 3 min, which is faster than DMSO-0.
The phase transition occurs even faster, and there is no CsPbBr3 observed in the photograph and XRD patterns after 3 min,
when the content is increased to DMSO-0.3. The improved transformation
speed is ascribed to the increased solubility of CsBr by DMSO.

the case of DMSO-0, DMSO-0.15, and DMSO-0.3; the purple diamonds,
orange stars, and black dots represent characteristic peaks of Cs4PbBr6, CsPbBr3, and CsBr, respectively.

To further reveal how the solvent affects the growth
of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites,
we have reduced
the speed of the chemical reaction by removing the ultrasonication
and observed the first-step reaction process. In Video S1, PbBr2 solution dissolved in DMSO-X (X = 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 from left to right,
respectively) was added into the vessel with preloaded CsBr powders.
The ratio of CsBr-to-PbBr2 was kept at 4:1, and the contents
of the reactants were the same for each one. It can be seen that the
chemical reaction between the CsBr and PbBr2 complex occurred
and an orange precipitate was formed at the bottom sequentially from
left to right after the addition of PbBr2 solution. XRD
measurement of the orange precipitate (Figure S4) confirms that the precipitate composes of CsPbBr3 and unreacted CsBr. It indicates that DMSO can effectively retard
the formation of CsPbBr3 during the first-step reaction.
The aforesaid results suggest that the reduced speed is ascribed to
the stronger coordination between PbBr2 and DMSO than DMF,
which retards the release of PbBr2 and is important for
the chemical reaction between PbBr2 and CsBr.

To
confirm the explanation above, we keep on increasing the contents
of DMSO during the fabrication of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites and see how it will affect the final
product. Figure S5a displays the evolution
of the XRD patterns of the final products with different DMSO ratios.
When the ratio is below DMSO-1, the XRD patterns show similar diffraction
peaks, and all of the diffraction peaks correspond to Cs4PbBr6 except for a small diffraction peak at 29.5°
from CsBr (denoted by the dot). With the ratio being above DMSO-1,
the diffraction intensity of CsBr increases obviously. By considering
the fixed value of contents of the reactant in all cases, there must
be abundant unreacted PbBr2 remaining in the solution with
higher DMSO contents. To verify this, we collected the supernatant
after the reaction was complete in the cases of DMSO-1, DMSO-1.5,
and DMSO-2, evaporated the solvent, and measured the XRD patterns
of the solids obtained. The results in Figure S5b show two new diffraction peaks indexed to the PbBr2(DMSO)2 complex (located at 10.8 and 14.3°)
in the cases of DMSO-1.5 and DMSO-2. This supports the hypothesis
well that the DMSO retards the release of PbBr2 and suppresses
the chemical reaction between PbBr2 and CsBr.

To
understand the influence of DMSO on CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites, we examined the morphology
of the nanocomposites by using TEM. Figure 3 shows the TEM images of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites prepared in the solvents
of DMSO-0 and DMSO-1. Both matrix structures clearly show that CsPbBr3 nanoparticles are embedded in the host Cs4PbBr6 materials. The average size of CsPbBr3 is 20 nm
in the case of pure DMF, whereas it is reduced to 6 nm in the case
of DMSO-1. The average size is 8 nm for DMSO-0.5 (not shown). Reduction
in the nanoparticle size indicates that the controlled growth by DMSO
strongly influences the microstructure of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites.

Figure 3 TEM image of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites
prepared in the solutions of (a) DMSO-0 and (b) DMSO-1.

Based on the above discussion, we summarize that DMSO delays
the
formation of CsPbBr3 (step 1) but it accelerates the transformation
from CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6 (step 2)
during the preparation of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites. Such modifications significantly influence
the critical size of the CsPbBr3 nanoparticles. This effect
can be well illustrated by the model below (Figure 4) based on the two-step growth theory. In
the first step, the CsPbBr3 crystals are formed with a
typical size of micrometers due to the higher Pb2+ concentration.
The concentration of Cs+ is inversely higher at the second
stage with the consumption of Pb2+. Then, the CsPbBr3 crystals start to dissolve and react with CsBr to produce
Cs4PbBr6. The CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites are produced when the Cs4PbBr6 crystals are grown on the surface of CsPbBr3 nanoparticles, which are not fully dissolved.20 Due to the strong coordination between PbBr2 and DMSO, the release of PbBr2 from the coordination
state PbBr2(DMSO)2 is difficult such that the
formation speed of CsPbBr3 particles is decelerated when
DMSO is included. Moreover, the transformation of CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6 is accelerated, induced by the
higher concentration of Cs+ due to the higher solubility
of CsBr in DMSO. Therefore, the size of CsPbBr3 NCs embedded
in host Cs4PbBr6 materials is smaller with the
inclusion of DMSO.

CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites in
the cases
of DMSO-0 (a) and DMSO-1 (b).

Effect of Solvent on the Optical Properties of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 Nanocomposites
Figure 5 shows the absorbance
and PL spectra of the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites prepared in DMSO-X. As the DMSO
ratio is increased, the intensity of the absorption peak around 505
nm related to CsPbBr3 NCs gradually decreases and a blue
shift of the absorption edge is also observed in Figure 5a. The PL spectrum (Figure 5b, excitation: 295
nm) indicates that the products exhibit a strong narrow emission peak
at around 517 nm (full width at half-maximum = 20 nm). A blue shift
of the PL spectrum appears as the DMSO ratio is increased, which is
consistent with the absorption spectrum. These phenomena are ascribed
to the quantum confinement effect of CsPbBr3 NCs, consistent
with the TEM results. Figure 5c shows that the introduction of DMSO-X can
significantly enhance the PLQY of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites. The maximum value of PLQY in the
case of DMSO-1 reaches 83%. The reduction of CsPbBr3 size
can spatially confine electrons and holes,22,23 which effectively improves its fluorescence efficiency. When the
content of DMSO is higher than 50% (DMSO-1), the PLQY starts to decrease.
We suggest that it is induced by the unreacted CsBr remaining in the
product since the content of CsBr is obviously increased when the
content is higher than DMSO-1 in Figure S5a. To verify it, we intentionally reduced the amount of CsBr reactant
to the ratio of 3.7 (CsBr/PbBr2) in the case of DMSO-1. Figure S6 shows the XRD patterns of the products
for the ratios of 3.7 and 4. The characteristic peaks of CsBr disappeared,
and all of the diffraction peaks are indexed to Cs4PbBr6 with the ratio of 3.7. The PLQY of the CsBr-free CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites was measured
to be 91%, which is much higher than the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites coexisting with the CsBr remnant.
This confirms that the lowered PLQY for high DMSO contents is induced
by the excessive CsBr remnant. By reducing/removing the CsBr remnant,
the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites
(DMSO-1.5) are also purified and the PLQY is optimized to be 88% when
the CsBr/PbBr2 ratio is 3.5. The corresponding XRD patterns
and PLQY of each sample are shown in Figure S7 and Table S1 in the Supporting Information. By comparing the
PLQYs of DMSO-1 and DMSO-1.5 samples, we suggest that the ratio of
CsPbBr3 to Cs4PbBr6 is probably another
factor affecting the PLQY of the nanocomposite since the CsPbBr3 size of DMSO-1.5 is even smaller but exhibits a lower PLQY.
Further research work is needed to confirm this in the future.

Conclusions
We fabricate CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites
by a simple self-assembly method. CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites are formed by a two-step reaction
driven by the ion concentration. CsPbBr3 is formed first
in the Pb-rich environment, and it converts to Cs4PbBr6 in the second step when the solution is Cs-rich, which leads
to the formation of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites. When the DMSO is introduced to the perovskite precursor
solution, it decelerates the first reaction speed due to the strong
coordination between Pb2+ and DMSO and accelerates the
second step owing to the larger solubility of CsBr in DMSO than in
DMF. Consequently, the critical size of CsPbBr3 NCs is
obviously decreased in the CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposites and the PLQY is increased from 56 to 91%.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Commercially available lead (II) bromide
(PbBr2 99.999%), cesium bromide (CsBr 99.999%), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and dimethyl
sulfoxide (DMSO) were purchased from Aldrich.

Synthesis of CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 Nanocomposites
For
this, 0.4 mmol PbBr2 was
dissolved into the mixed solvent of DMF and DMSO with different volume
ratios (the total volume is 2 mL) in a centrifuge tube with a volume
of 5 mL. Then, the precursor is mixed with 1.6 mmol CsBr (CsBr/PbBr2 molar ratio of 4:1). The centrifuge tube was ultrasonicated
for about 30 min until a light yellowish precipitate appears. The
precipitate was collected via centrifugation (TGL-16G) at 5000 rpm
for 5 min and then dried in a vacuum oven at 70 °C to obtain
CsPbBr3/Cs4PbBr6 nanocomposite powders.

Characterization
The crystal structure was determined
using an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 Advance) with Cu Kα
radiation (λ = 1.5406 Å). TEM images were captured on an
FEI Tecnai G2 F30 transmission electron microscope operated at 300
kV. Absorption spectra were obtained using a UV–visible–near
infrared (NIR) spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3600). Photoluminescence
(PL) spectra were measured on a PerkinElmer LS55 fluorescence spectrometer.
Absolute PLQYs were measured by a Quantaurus-QY spectrometer (C11347-11,
Hamamatsu, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 450 nm.

Experiments
on the Coordination between Reactants and Solvent
To investigate
the coordination and dissolution characteristics
of reactants in the mixed solvents, we sequentially dissolved 0.04
mmol PbBr2 powder into DMF/DMSO solvent, measured the UV–visible–NIR
spectra of the solution, heated the solution at 60 °C for 24
h in a vacuum to evaporate the solvent, and investigated the crystal
structure of the obtained solids by XRD. The coordination behavior
of CsBr in the mixed solvent was investigated using the same experimental
method.
