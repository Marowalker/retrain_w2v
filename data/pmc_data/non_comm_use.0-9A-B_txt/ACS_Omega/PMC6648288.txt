An
exceptionally unique, easy-to-prepare, and economic charge transfer
complex (CTC), [(IMH)+(PA)−], was synthesized
as a highly selective real-time colorimetric chemosensor material
for nitro explosive nitrobenzene (NB) and Co2+ ion. Co2+ and NB are highly potential toxic and hazardous beyond the
exposure limits and also classified as carcinogens (group 2B) by IARS
and United States Environmental Protection Agency. Unusual sensing
ability with appreciatively low detection limits of 0.114 and 0.589
ppb for NB and Co2+ ion, respectively, in the aqueous medium
of dimethyl sulfoxide has been reported for the first time among this
class of complexes reported so far. The mechanism of the tremendous
sensing behavior of this material as chemosensor was ascertained by
static quenching mechanism, Dexter electron transfer, and Forster
resonance energy transfer dynamic quenching mechanism, which was supported
by spectral overlapping and density functional theory (DFT) (B-3LYP/def2-SVP)
calculations. Real-time colorimetric sensing behavior of chemosensor
was demonstrated by the naked eye test and prestained paper Co2+ strip test. Job’s plot and comparative Fourier transform
infrared (FTIR) study between CTC and CTC–Co2+ complex
revealed the coordination mode between CTC and Co2+ ion
and 2:1 stoichiometry. This sensing material [(IMH)+(PA)−] was synthesized with donor imidazole (IM) and acceptor
picric acid (PA), and its characterization was achieved by experimental
(single-crystal X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis–differential
thermal analysis, FTIR, and UV–vis studies) and theoretical
methods [DFT/TD-DFT calculations, comparing experimental–theoretical
data and obtaining MEP map along with electronic energy gap of HOMO
→ LUMO (ΔE = 3.545 eV) and Hirshfeld
surfaces analysis]. The SC-XRD confirms the composition and bonding
features, which show hydrogen bond via N+–H···O– between IM and PA. This N+–H···O– interaction plays a significant role in Co2+ binding, proving this method of synthesizing CTC as a chemosensor
to be a novel approach.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Nitrobenzene
(NB) is a toxic industrial chemical used as a precursor
for explosives, pesticides, and synthetic rubbers, as well as for
preparation of dyes and pharmaceuticals.1 NB can easily be inhaled, ingested, and penetrated through the skin.
Being a highly toxic chemical, it could cause methemoglobinemia; hemolytic
anemia; splenic congestion; liver, bone marrow, and spleen hematopoiesis;
and diseases of the central nervous system (CNS).2,3 The
United States Environmental Protection Agency and IARC considered
and classified NB as a group 2B carcinogen for humans. Apart from
being a vitamin B12 component and an essential trace element,
excess Co2+ has toxic effects and may cause severe problems
to health like cardiomyopathy, hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy,
and respiratory disorders.4 Co2+ is also determined as carcinogenic to humans by IARC.5 Considering these toxic effects of NB and Co2+, it is a topic of concern to develop a real-time highly
selective and sensitive sensor that can detect them in the presence
of other nitroaromatic compounds and heavy-metal ions, respectively,
even by the naked eye. Many sensors based on metal-organic frameworks
(MOFs)6,7 and organic frameworks8,9 have
been reported, but charge transfer complexes (CTCs) as chemosensors
is an emerging field to explore, and very few CTCs for this purpose
have been reported.10,11 Owing to the easy synthetic route,
low cost, and good luminescent behavior, there is a perceived need
to design CT complex to be employed as a potent sensor toward nitro
explosive and toxic metal ions. Charge transfer complex is a complexation
between an electron-rich moiety (donor) and electron-deficient moiety
(acceptor) through weak hydrogen bonding like interaction (N+—H···O –), which was introduced
and described by Mulliken and Foster.12−14 The CTCs formed are
usually intensely colored due to electronic transitions.15,16 Apart from sensors, CTCs have inordinate importance and applications
in different fields like photocatalysts,17,18 redox processes,19 organic semiconductors,20 microemulsion,21,22 dendrimers,23 second-order nonlinear optical activity,24 and biological systems (drug action: antibacterial,
antifungal, and insecticides).25−28

In this paper, a new charge transfer complex
is synthesized, characterized,
and its real-time sensing ability toward nitro explosives and heavy-metal
ions have been reported. Respective CTC is a result of interaction
between imidazole (electron donor) and picric acid (electron acceptor)
through hydrogen-bonding network. Imidazole ring is incorporated in
many biological molecules29 and used as
pharmaceutical derivatives in antibiotic and antifungal drugs.30 Similarly, picric acid has also been used as
antiseptic for treatment of malaria, smallpox, herpes, and trench
foot.31

Our primary objective is
to explore the sensing ability of the
synthesized material in aqueous dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) medium.
Fluorescence quenching method was employed to descry sensed analytes,
and selective discriminative sensing behavior was examined through
cross-titration fluorescence experiment. The mechanism of sensing
was discovered, and the Stern–Volmer (S–V) equation,
quenching efficiencies, and detection limits were investigated. Static
quenching mechanism was studied through the changes in the absorption
spectra of CTC, Dexter electron transfer (DET) dynamic quenching mechanism
was also satisfied by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** basis
set level, and Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) dynamic quenching
mechanism was evidenced by spectral overlapping. Real-time colorimetric
sensing was observed by the naked eye. Job’s method along with
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy reveals the coordination
mode between CTC and Co2+. Prestained paper Co2+ strip was also prepared. Stability of CTC was confirmed by powder
XRD and solid–liquid-phase UV–vis spectra. Moreover,
structural properties, thermodynamic stability, intermolecular interactions,
spectral studies, and solvent dependence of synthesized material were
investigated by FTIR, thermal gravimetric analysis–differential
thermal analysis (TGA–DTA), Hirshfeld surface analysis, and
UV–vis studies. Furthermore, confirmation of CTC formation
via hydrogen bonding (N+—H···O –) was also achieved by single-crystal X-ray diffraction.
These experimental data were cross-checked by TD-DFT B-3LYP/def2-SVP
level theoretical calculations.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Instrumental Characterization
2.1.1 FTIR Spectra
FTIR spectrum of CTC
[(IMH)+(PA)−] is compared to the spectra
of donor (IM) and acceptor (PA) for the deliberation of obtained FTIR
results shown in Figure S1, Supporting
Information. From the spectra for IM, PA, and CTC, it was found that
O–H and C–N stretching vibrations appear at 3430 and
1446 cm–1, respectively, in PA and IM; on the other
hand, O–H and C–N stretching bands are observed at 3443
and 1496 cm–1 in the spectrum of CTC. A new band
in the range 3443–3340 cm–1 appears to be
attributed to the stretching vibration of N+—H···O–, which designates hydrogen bonding. Majority of the
bands of CTC were shifted to higher frequencies compared to those
of IM, while shifted toward lower frequencies as those of PA.

2.1.2 Electronic Spectra and Solvent Dependence
The electronic
spectra of the IM, PA, and CTC were recorded in
the ultraviolet region 200–500 nm in ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile,
and DMSO/3H2O separately (Figure S2, Supporting Information). The solutions of concentration 1 ×
10–4 M were prepared for IM and PA in all respective
solvents and UV spectra were obtained. The maximum absorption in CT
complex was observed at 353 nm in ethanol, 355 nm in methanol, 362
nm in acetonitrile, and 378 nm in DMSO/H2O as a result
of n → π* transition (Scheme 1). This study indicates that the formation
of CTC depends on the polarity of the solvent, and other important
physical parameters can also be calculated, which were achieved in
our previous studies.41−45

Scheme 1 Mechanism of the Reaction
2.1.3 Thermograms Study
TG/DTA was conducted
for free moieties (IM and PA) and their CTC [(IMH)+(PA)−] to investigate their thermal stability and also the
interaction between IM and PA (Figure S3, Supporting Information). Table S2, Supporting
Information, shows important data of thermograms. DTA of [(IMH)+(PA)−] shows two endothermic peaks and one
exothermic peak at 87.08 °C (ΔH = −189.10
mJ), 214.15 °C (ΔH = −176.82 mJ),
and 303.49 °C (ΔH = −354.0 mJ),
respectively, whereas IM (donor) shows two endothermic peaks observed
at 96.61 °C (ΔH = −371.74 mJ) and
219.09 °C (ΔH = −526.18 mJ), and
three endothermic peaks were observed at 121.49 °C (ΔH = −276.04 mJ), 240.95 °C (ΔH = −386.48 mJ), and 281.40 °C (ΔH = – 430.63 mJ) in DTA of PA (acceptor). TGA of [(IMH)+(PA)−] gives decomposition at 314.27 °C
(as for midpoints) with the weight loss of 81.98%. IM decomposes at
199.93 °C (as for midpoints) with weight losses of almost 99.92%,
and PA was decomposed at 274.44 °C (as for midpoints) with weight
losses of 99.26%. From this discussion and observation, it was concluded
that the synthesized [(IMH)+(PA)−] is
thermodynamically more stable than free reactant moieties. Also, divergences
in thermogram of [(IMH)+(PA)−] was noted
from IM and PA, which assures the formation of [(IMH)+(PA)−].46

2.2 X-ray Crystallographic Studies of CT Complex
For the
better understanding of the structure along with the bonding
features of the synthesized CTC [(IMH)+(PA)−], single-crystal X-ray diffraction method has been employed. The
crystal structure of CTC formed among IM and PA divulges that the
empirical formula of synthesized CTC is “C9H7N5O7·0.5H2O”,
which assembles stable crystal lattice through H-bonding between N5
(protonated) of IM and O1 (deprotonated) of PA with a distance of
2.097 Å. The crystal packing of [(IMH)+(PA)−] is represented in Figure S4, Supporting
Information. The ORTEP view of the CTC consisting of IMH+ cation and PA– anion is shown in Figure 1. The formation of the N—H···O
bond between IM and PA results in the shift of bond lengths (BL) of
other atoms as well from that of free IM and PA. The bond lengths
N5–N4, N5–H7, and N5–H9 in free IM were recorded
to be 2.197, 2.007, and 2.064 Å, respectively, while in [(IMH)+(PA)−], they were obtained as 2.185, 2.010,
and 2.027 Å, respectively. Similarly, free PA bond lengths H1–C–,
H1–C2, H1–N1, H1–O2, O1–C6, O1–O7,
and C2–C6 were recorded to be 1.856, 2.431, 2.390, 1.732, 2.368,
2.602, and 2.359 Å, respectively, while in [(IMH)+(PA)−], they were obtained as 1.708, 2.389, 2.472,
2.075, 2.379, 2.689, and 2.403, Å respectively (Figure 1). This shift in bond lengths
is due to the transfer of electron and hence the formation of N+—H···O– bond between
free moieties. This confirms the formation of CTC through proton transfer
from free IM to free PA. The crystal data with refinement parameters
for [(IMH)+(PA)−] are given in Table S1, Supporting Information and bond lengths
in Table 1.

2.3 Fluorescence Property with Detection of NB
Fluorescence
of CTC was recorded in different solvents as the local
environment along with solvent polarity has insightful effects on
fluorophore’s emission spectral property.47 The fluorescence intensity was observed to be very intense
in the aqueous medium of DMSO with the ratio 1:3 (DMSO:3H2O) (Figure 2, S5, Supporting Information). DMSO/H2O has been opted as a common dispersive solvent for both CTC and
analytes, as it is well known that the aqueous medium of DMSO possesses
nonideal thermodynamic and transport behaviors.48 On excitation at 350 nm, emission at 479 nm was observed
for CTC in DMSO/H2O medium. Thus, the sensing behavior
of CTC in the aqueous medium of DMSO was examined for explosive nitroaromatics
(NACs) and metal ions.

Figure 2 Emission spectrum of CTC dispersed in different solvents
upon excitation
at 340 nm.

Fluorescence titration was conducted
for different nitroaromatics,
NB (nitrobenzene), m-DNB (1,3-dinitrobenzene), ONP
(2-nitrophenol), ONA (2-nitroaniline), MNA (3-nitroaniline), DNP (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine),
TNP (2,4,6-trinitrophenol), DNT (2,4-dinitrotoluene), NT (4-nitrotoluene),
and p-DNB (1,4-dinitrobenzene) by progressive addition
of accurately measured 1 mM solutions. Among all of the NACs used,
nitrobenzene showed a remarkable fall in fluorescence intensity of
CTC on gradual addition (Figure 3). This experiment surveys the sensing capability of
CTC for different nitroaromatics. Incredibly, 99.04% of fluorescence
quenching to the initial intensity was observed on adding 1.145 ppb
of NB. However, fluorescence quenching of about 38.08% was recorded
even in the very low concentration of NB, that is, on adding 0.114
ppb, which is almost the highest value recorded for other NB-sensing
materials of charge transfer complexes.2,49 On the other
hand, no or negligible fluorescence quenching to the initial intensity
was obtained for other NACs—m-DNB, ONP, ONA,
MNA, DNP, and TNP (Figures 3 and S6, Supporting Information).
To confirm that CTC, as a whole, is responsible for sensing of NB
and not the individual free reactants (IM and PA), the same fluorescence
titration experiment was conducted for NB with free IM and PA independently.
It was clearly observed that there was no or negligible quenching
in the case of both free donor and acceptor, which confirms that the
sensing of NB is caused by the charge transfer complex as a whole
(Figure S7, Supporting Information). To
explore the selective discriminative sensing behavior of CTC toward
NB, cross-titration fluorescence experiment was performed and it was
found that other NACs have no effect on the fluorescence quenching
of NB, as no quenching of intensity can be seen on the initial addition
of other NACs, while a notable quenching can be observed after adding
NB (Figure S8, Supporting Information).
This evidently concludes the interaction between NB and CTC supporting
the exceedingly selective sensing behavior of CTC toward NB.

in fluorescence intensity of CTC upon addition of different
NACs. (b) Change in fluorescence intensity of CTC upon incremental
addition of NB. (c) Digital photographs of CTC solutions in the presence
of different NACs under normal light (top) and under portable UV light
(bottom).

UV–vis spectra of CTC were
recorded in solid state and are
found to be identical (same λmax value) with the
UV–vis spectra of CTC in solution (DMSO/H2O) ascertaining
the stability of the CTC in the dissolved state. (Figure S9, Supporting Information).50 The powder X-ray diffraction (P-XRD) patterns have been procured
through Panalytical X’Pert PRO diffractometer with Cu anode
material with radiations as Kα1 (λ = 1.540
Å), Kα2 (λ = 1.544 Å), and Kβ (λ = 1.392 Å). The P-XRD of CTC was recorded
to confirm the phase purity of the synthesized CTC. Identical P-XRD
patterns of CTC were recorded for with and without NB, which is in
a decent agreement with the simulated P-XRD pattern confirming the
structural reliability and phase purity of the CTC. This discovers
no degradation of the CTC after submerging in NB (Figure S10, Supporting Information).

2.3.1 Mechanistic
Insights
To investigate
the cause behind the mechanism of quenching for selective sensing
of NB, all of the NACs were employed to Stern–Volmer (S–V)
equation and the quenching efficiencies were calculated.51 NACs except NB showed linear drifts in the S–V
plots, whereas for NB, the S–V plots showed upward linear incensement
on increased concentrations (Figure S11, Supporting Information). A 3D presentation of the S–V plots
of CTC for various NACs is shown in Figure 4. Linear fitting to the S–V plot of
NB was employed, and the quenching constant was calculated to be 6.49
× 103 (R2 = 0.88171),
which indicates the tremendous quenching abilities of CTC toward NB
in the aqueous medium of DMSO.

Figure 4 Three-dimensional (3D) representation
of the Stern–Volmer
(SV) plots of CTC for various NACs.

To understand the static quenching mechanism, we analyzed
the changes
in the absorption spectra of CTC on adding NACs individually. In the
case of NB, a new band appears at 274 nm. It can also be seen that
on gradual addition of NB, the absorbance of this band increases (Figure 5).2 This change in UV–vis spectra indicates the interaction
between CTC and NB with the formation of a nonemissive ground-state
complex, which is an agreement assuring the static mechanism of quenching,
whereas no significant change was observed in the spectra of other
NACs (Figure S12, Supporting Information).

Figure 5 UV–vis
spectra of CTC upon gradual addition of NB showing
spectral change with the appearance of a new band at 274 nm.

The electron can also be transferred
through the nonradiative pathway,
which is termed as the Dexter electron transfer (DET) dynamic quenching
mechanism by Dexter.52 The HOMO and LUMO
energies of CTC (electron-rich) and all NACs (electron-deficient)
were calculated by DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G** basis set
level (Figures 6 and 7). LUMO energy = −3.005 eV and HOMO energy
= −6.911 eV for CTC, and for NB, LUMO energy = −3.149
eV and HOMO energy = −7.636 eV were obtained (Table S3, Supporting Information). This DFT result concludes
that electron can easily be transferred from LUMO orbit (excited-state
electron) of CTC to the LUMO orbit of NB satisfying the Dexter electron
transfer dynamic quenching mechanism. On studying the LUMO energies
of other NACs, it was noted that the obtained quenching efficiency
of these NACs experimentally was not in the sequence. This clearly
designates that the DET mechanism is not the only mechanism behind
the quenching of intensity.53 Forster resonance
energy transfer (FRET), an important dynamic quenching mechanism,
also plays an important role in the nonradiative transfer. To prove
the FRET mechanism, the UV–vis spectra for all of the NACs
were recorded (Figure 8). Only NB showed the maximum overlapping of UV–vis spectra
with the emission spectra of CTC. However, it was negligible or little
for the other NACs, which confirms that both FRET and DET dynamic
quenching mechanisms are responsible for the selective fluorescence
quenching with NB while for other NACs, only DET dynamic quenching
mechanism causes fluorescence quenching.54 Further, vapor pressure of analyte also plays an important role
in sensing. The vapor pressure of NB is the highest among all of the
analytes examined, and therefore, NB shows discriminating behavior
among all of the nitro explosives investigated for sensing.55 Chromogenic change was observed by the naked
eye in normal light as well as in UV only on addition of NB in CTC,
i.e., pale yellow to orange (Figure 3).

Figure 6 HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the molecular orbitals
considered
for the nitro analytes and the ligand.

and normalized absorbance spectra of the nitro analytes.

metal ions. (b) Change in fluorescence intensity of CTC upon incremental
addition of Co2+. (c) Digital photographs of CTC solutions
in the presence of different metal ions under normal light (top) and
under portable UV light (bottom).

The detection limit was calculated for used 0.5–5.0
μL,
1 mM stock solution of NB, fluorescence intensities were plotted against
the increased concentrations of NB, the slope (m)
of graph was determined, and the standard deviation (r) was calculated from five blank measurements of CTC (Figure S13, Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information).
Using the formula of detection limit = (3σ/m) (where σ is the standard deviation and m is the slope), the
detection limit of CTC for NB was calculated and found to be 2.78
× 10–3 μM (0.112 ppb).

2.3.2 Detection of Co2+
Sensing
ability of CTC was also determined for some heavy-metal ions—Cr2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Ca2+, Li+, Na+, and K+ (chloride salts of metal
ion). A similar fluorescence titration experimental approach was established,
and about 94.15% of fluorescence quenching to the initial intensity
was observed on adding 4.125 ppb of Co2+. However, fluorescence
quenching of about 37.36% was recorded even in the very low concentration
of Co2+, i.e., 0.589 ppb (Figures 8 and S14, Supporting
Information).56 While performing this experiment
with individual free reactants (IM and PA), it was clearly observed
that there was no or negligible quenching in the case of both free
donor and acceptor, which confirms that the sensing of Co2+ is caused by the charge transfer complex as a whole (Figure S15, Supporting Information). Cross-titration
fluorescence experiment confirms selective discriminative sensing
behavior of CTC toward Co2+. No effect on the fluorescence
quenching of Co2+ was recorded even in the presence of
other selected metal ions supporting anti-interference ability (Figure S16, Supporting Information). The Stern–Volmer
(S–V) equation and the quenching efficiencies were estimated
for all of the metal ions (Figures 9 and S17, Supporting Information).51 The S–V plots of Co2+ showed
upward linear incensement on increased concentrations unlike other
metal ions with linear drifts. Linear fitting to the S–V plot
of Co2+ was employed, and the quenching constant was calculated
and found to be 1.11 × 103 (R2 = 0.85439), which indicates the tremendous quenching abilities
of CTC toward Co2+ in the aqueous medium of DMSO.

Figure 9 Three-dimensional
(3D) representation of the Stern–Volmer
(S–V) plots of CTC for various metal ions.

The UV–vis spectra for all of the metal ions were
measured
separately (Figure S18, Supporting Information).
A new peak with blue-shifted λmax by 82 nm was observed
at 296 nm only in the case of Co2+ (Figure 10). The change in the color
of CTC solution from yellow to green on adding Co2+ was
clearly observed by the naked eye (Figure 8). This phenomenon endorses the decrease
in charge transfer effect between IM and PA moieties, owing to the
strongly weakened electron-donating ability of N atom in IM and OH
group in PA upon coordination to Co2+. While Fe2+ also makes the absorption peak blue-shifted by 7 nm, the change
in color of CTC solution was not observed and thus cannot be clearly
distinguished by the naked eye.10 Illumination
of UV light using a UV lamp shows that the CTC can also act as a fluorescence
turn-off probe for Co2+ with a decent selectivity.

spectra of CTC upon gradual addition of Co2+ showing spectral
change with the appearance of a new band at 296
nm.

2.3.3 Coordination
Mode
After confirming
selectivity of the CTC, it is important to scrutinize the coordination
mode between CTC and Co2+ to study the recognition nature
of CTC to Co2+. Job’s method was applied to investigate
the binding stoichiometry between CTC and Co2+. Different
solutions of CTC and Co2+ with different ratios were prepared
so that the total concentration of CTC and Co2+ remains
unchanged. The absorption spectrum was recorded for each of the different
solutions. From the attained results of UV–vis spectra, Job’s
plot was obtained (Figure 11). The stoichiometry of the complex (CTC–Co2+) was obtained to be 2:1 from the results of Job’s plot. The
proposed structure of the CTC–Co2+ complex is represented
in Figure 11.5,57 FTIR spectra of crystalline charge transfer complex and CTC–Co2+ complex were recorded (Figure S19, Supporting Information).58 The O–H
band of CTC (PA moiety) has shifted to a higher frequency 3450 cm–1 from 3443 cm–1 in the CTC–Co2+ complex. C–N and C=N stretching frequencies
of CTC have also shifted from 1435 to 1486 cm–1 and
from 1496 to 1486 cm–1, respectively. Most importantly,
the band at 3340 cm–1 attributing to N+—H···O– has shifted to lower
frequency at 3278 cm–1, confirming that charge transfer
interaction between IM-PA forming [(IMH)+(PA)−] plays a vital role in coordination mode between Co2+ and CTC. The metal-ligand frequency at 420 cm–1 was also found, which supports the presence of Co2+–N
bond. To confirm this site of binding of Co2+, electron
density surface of CTC was obtained through DFT-6-31G** basis set.
The red surface around the NO2 and OH (involved in CT interaction)
group indicates the binding site for Co2+ ions (Figure 11). DFT calculation
was also conducted for CTC–Co2+ complex.
The electronic energy gap (ΔE) of HOMO →
LUMO is found to be 1.861 eV, which is less than ΔE of CTC (discussed later). Molecular electrostatic potential map
(MEP) of CTC–Co2+ complex has also been represented.
The red region on the MEP surface represents the most electronegative
potentials, while the blue regions represent positive electrostatic
potential and the green regions represent the neutral sites (Figure 12).

modes (bottom), and (e) paper strip detection for other metal ions.

2.3.4 Co2+ Strip
As we have
confirmed the selectivity and sensitivity of synthesized CTC toward
Co2+ in colorimetric as well as in fluorescent modes, even
though sometimes it is not always suitable to use solution mode analysis.
A paper substrate engraved with CTC can be used for fabricating Co2+ strip. Now tremendous probability can be achieved by CTC
to sense Co2+ (as pH strip works). For the preparation
of Co2+ strip, a piece of filter paper was engrossed into
the solution of CTC for about 1 min and dried over warm air.10 These prepared strips were submerged in different
concentrations of Co2+ (for 1 s), and immediate change
in color was observed by the naked eye in normal as well as in UV
light illuminated by UV lamp. The detection limit from this method
was observed up to the level of 1 × 10–4 M.
The various concentrations of Co2+ give different results
in both colorimetric and fluorescence modes (Figure 11). A similar experiment was also performed
for other metal ions solutions of 10–2 M concentration,
and no change in color was observed (Figure 11).

2.3.5 Effect
of pH on CTC
The performance
of CTC was tested in various pH environments. The fluorescence signal
of CTC solution before (F0) and after
(F) addition of Co2+ was separately recorded
(Figure 13), and the
ratio of F0/F demonstrated
obvious contrast with value more than 5 in the pH range of 5–8,
manifesting that the probe can work well in this range. Too acidic
environment may protonate the pyrrole moiety, which reduces the coordination
ability, and too basic environment may reduce the free Co2+ ions in solution and influence the sensitivity.59

Figure 13 Performance of CTC versus pH environment.

The detection limit was calculated for used 10–70
μL,
1 mM stock solution of Co2+, and fluorescence intensities
were plotted against the increased concentrations of Co2+. The slope (m) of the graph was determined, and the standard deviation
(r) was calculated from five blank measurements of
CTC (Figure S20, Tables S6 and S7, Supporting
Information). Using the formula of detection limit = (3σ/m), the detection limit of CTC for Co2+ was calculated
and found to be 7.68 × 10–3 μM (0.589
ppb).

2.4 Binding Constant for NB
and Co2+
For calculating binding constants of
analytes, the fluorescence
data were further examined by using the modified Stern–Volmer
equation (MSV)60  where F0 is the
fluorescence intensity before the addition of quencher (NB/Co2+), F is the fluorescence intensity after
the addition of quencher, [Q] is the concentration of quencher, and Ka denotes the binding constant of molecule,
which can be calculated from the slope and intercept, as shown in Figure 14. The calculated
binding constants for NB and Co2+ were found to be 911.69
and 40.98 M–1 respectively.

plots for the quenching of NB (left)
and Co2+ (right).

2.5 Hirshfeld Surface Analyses
The region
where the molecule endowment to the crystal electron density outstrips
that from all other crystal molecules, i.e., w(r) ≥ 0.5, is the Hirshfeld surface in a crystal.61 These regions of the CTC are described in Figure S21, Supporting Information, where the
mapped surfaces ranging from −0.5 to 1.5 Å dnorm have been shown. The transparent surfaces help envision
the moieties around which they were inspected. The hydrogen-bonding
contacts are indicated by deep red depressions and notable on the dnorm surfaces. The assertive interactions between
C–H····π, C–H····H,
C–O····C, and N–O····H
for the CTC are presented in the Hirshfeld surface plots and shown
with red spots. The prominent information about the Hirshfeld surfaces
decomposition is provided by 2D fingerprint plots (Figure S22, Supporting Information), where two distinct spikes
show N–O····H intermolecular interaction,
which are of unequal lengths in the region 2.32 Å < (de + di) < 2.34
Å and are displayed by the blue pattern in the full fingerprint
2D plots. Close contacts of particular pair atoms were also highlighted
in fingerprint plots. Different types of interactions were separated
for better understanding.

2.6 DFT Studies
2.6.1 Optimized Structure and Mulliken Atomic
Charges
An MM2 method has been practiced for energy minimization
of free moieties (IM and PA) and their synthesized CT complex [(IMH)+(PA)−]. DFT-B3LYP calculations of Gaussian-0.3
software were applied for obtaining full-energy optimization of the
[(IMH)+(PA)−]. The stabilization total
energies of free moieties (IM and PA) were −223.49 and −910.67
a.u., respectively, while for synthesized [(IMH)+(PA)−], it was −1125.57 a.u., which approves the
higher stability of the [(IMH)+(PA)−].
On account of Mulliken charges, it was concretely evident that there
is an increase in negative charge on O1 atom of [(IMH)+(PA)−] to 0.705816e from 0.341228e of free PA, which is due to the dissociation of O1–H1
bond in [(IMH)+(PA)−]. Furthermore, the
positive charge on the H1 atom of [(IMH)+(PA)−] is expressively decreased to 0.370607e from 0.455639e of free PA because of proton transferred to N5 atom by
increasing its negative atomic charge moderately to 0.281933e from 0.273359 of free IM. The large availability of charge
on O1 = −0.705816e suggests the formation
of N+—H···O–-type
interaction in this system, which was also confirmed by SC-XRD results.
Apart from these, other atoms of [(IMH)+(PA)−] also show the shift in Mulliken charges from free IM and PA. These
shifts provide a strong confirmation of the CT and proton transfer
interaction between IM and PA tabularized in Table 2. A similar conclusion has been drawn in
other studies.62,63 Molecular electrostatic potential
map (MEP) of [(IMH)+(PA)−] has been calculated
using B3LYP/6-31G** calculations. The different colors on the MEP
surface refer to the strength of the electrostatic potentials as red
and blue regions, which symbolize the most electronegative and positive
electrostatic potential, respectively, while the green regions represent
the neutral sites (Figure S23, Supporting
Information). The attractive blue region is located at the electronegative
atoms of donor PA, while the repulsive red region is located on the
aromatic ring of PA and IM.

2.6.2 TD-DFT Calculations
Experimental
electronic absorption spectra of [(IMH)+(PA)−] presented broad absorption band with λmax at 353
nm in ethanol, 355 nm in methanol, 362 nm in acetonitrile, and 378
nm in DMSO/H2O. UV–vis spectra were investigated
by the TD-DFT method with the basis set as 6-31G**, and it was observed
that two electronic absorption bands at 333 and 388 nm were obtained
from TD-DFT computations. The experimentally broad absorption band
of [(IMH)+(PA)−] is a combination of
two absorption transitions at 333 and 388 nm with the average value
at 360 nm (Figure S24, Supporting Information).
FTIR spectrum was also investigated by the DFT method and found quite
identical to experimental spectra (Figure S25, Supporting Information). The computed UV–vis absorption
bands at 333 and 388 nm are assigned to HOMO → LUMO and HOMO
– 1 → LUMO, respectively. The electronic energy gap
of HOMO → LUMO is procured to be ΔE =
3.545 eV, and that of HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1 is 4.3786
eV, from frontier molecular orbitals (Figure S26, Supporting Information). It can also be said that the occupied
and virtual MOs are located on the acceptor moiety, and subsequently,
the experimentally electronic absorption bands are mainly intramolecular
charge transfer in nature. The MO diagram is shown in Figure S27 (Supporting Information), and MO energies
are tabularized in Table S8 (Supporting
Information). Thus, the result can be described in terms of increased
electron density on PA moiety of [(IMH)+(PA)−] and hydrogen-bonding interactions between IM with PA.

3 Conclusions
We have successfully synthesized a bifunctional
aqueous medium
sensing material for nitrobenzene and Co2+ ion. The incredibly
low detection limits of 0.114 and 0.589 ppb for nitrobenzene and Co2+ ion, respectively, were obtained, which have not yet been
discovered in any other organic CTC sensor so far in the literature.
The obtained detection limits are impressively below the permissible
limit set by NIOSH, US EPA, and WHO. Fluorescence titration experiment
was performed to investigate the sensing behavior of the synthesized
material. UV–vis spectroscopy studies assure the static mechanism
of quenching in low concentration, while DFT calculations at the B3LYP/6-31G**
basis set level and CTC emission–analyte and absorption spectral
overlap confirm the Dexter electron transfer (DET) and Forster resonance
energy transfer (FRET) dynamic quenching mechanism in high concentration.
Naked eye color change of solution was very prominent in both the
cases (NB and Co2+) in normal as well as in UV light. The
prepared Co2+ strip reveals that the detection limit of
Co2+ can reach up to the level of 1 × 10–4 M using this method. To explore the coordination mode between CTC
and Co2+ ion, Job’s plot along with comparative
FTIR spectra were studied and 2:1 stoichiometry (2CTC:Co2+) was obtained. The N+–H···O– interaction in CTC, which is the base of formation
of this sensing material, was found to play a key role in binding
of Co2+, making CTC chemosensor novel.

For characterization
of prepared sensing material [(IMH)+(PA)−], single-crystal X-ray diffraction was employed
to confirm the composition and bonding features. N+–H···O– interaction between IM and PA was also confirmed by
SC-XRD. FTIR spectroscopy, UV–vis spectrophotometry, and TGA–DTA
also confirmed the formation of thermodynamically more stable CTC
than free IM and PA moieties and the dependence of formation of CTC
on the polarity of solvent used. The intermolecular interactions like
C–H····π, C–H····H,
and C–O····C along with N–O····H
(spikes of almost equal length) were verified by the Hirshfeld surfaces
analysis. The molecular electrostatic potential map along with the
electronic energy gap of HOMO → LUMO (ΔE = 3.545 eV) and HOMO – 1 → LUMO + 1 (ΔE = 4.3786 eV) was obtained from Frontier molecular orbitals
through TD-DFT calculations (DFT/B3LYP level). The present study advances
the field of low-cost, easily reparable, and easy-to-use novel sensory
materials in view of their synthesis, application, and the mechanism
of detection. Spurred by the intriguing need to detect the hazardous
explosive (nitrobenzene) and Co2+, the designed material
would add new perspectives to the field of sensors. The sensor can
further be studied and modified, and can be used to detect NB in drinking
water and Co2+ in human blood serum an fecal samples.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Synthesis
of Stable CT Complex
All of the reagents, including imidazole
(Aldrich) and picric acid
(Merck), for synthesis were bought up commercially of analytical grade.
All of the nitroaromatic compounds—NB (nitrobenzene), m-DNB (1,3-dinitrobenzene), ONP (2-nitrophenol), ONA (2-nitroaniline),
MNA (3-nitroaniline), DNP (2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine), TNP (2,4,6-trinitrophenol),
DNT (2,4-dinitrotoluene), NT (4-nitrotoluene), and p-DNB (1,4-dinitrobenzene), and chloride salts of metal ion—chromium,
manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, calcium, lithium, sodium,
and potassium were from Sigma-Aldrich.

The CTC of imidazole
(IM) with picric acid (PA) was synthesized by preparing the individual
saturated solution of IM (0.35 g, 5 mmol) and PA (1.145 g, 5 mmol)
in ethanol, followed by mixing these two saturated solutions. A clear
solution is obtained upon mixing, which was stirred continuously for
1 h and left standing for 24 h at room temperature. Yellow powder
like CT complex was formed in solution. This CTC was stained, washed
numerous times with small amounts of solvent (ethanol), and dried
in a desiccator (anhydrous calcium chloride). For crystal growth,
the CTC obtained as precipitate was dissolved in the solvent (acetonitrile)
and stirred for 4 h at 40 °C and filtered off, and the uncontaminated
filtrate was then kept in a dust-free compartment for 4 days without
disturbing. Yellow crystals were obtained (Figure 1).

4.2 Instrumental Characterization
of Solid CTC
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy
of CTC was recorded
along with IM and PA individually by employing spectroscopic 2020
FTIR spectrometer (KBr disk technique). The electronic absorption
spectra of IM, PA, and CTC were obtained separately in different polar
solvents (ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, and DMSO/H2O)
in the UV region of 200–500 nm, using a spectrophotometer—PERKINELMER
UV Lambda-45. For obtaining the wavelength of CTC, the individual
solution of PA and IM in the same solvent (1:1 ratio) was mixed and
left overnight at room temperature without disturbing. For obtaining 1H NMR spectrum, Bruker Avance IT-400 (400 MHz) NMR spectrometer
was used. TGA and DTA (thermogravimetric and differential thermal)
analyses of the free moieties (IM and PA) and CTC were recorded, employing
EXSTAR TG/DTA 6300 model as the instrument at the heating rate of
20 °C/min using nitrogen atmosphere with the flow rate of 0 [mL/min].

4.2.1 Single-Crystal X-ray Study
This
is one of the finest approved methods to explore the structural and
crystallographic data of the crystalline sample (CTC), for which Bruker
SMARTAPEX as diffractometer (graphite—monochromatic of Kα,
with k = 0.71073 Å) at 296 K was employed. Unit
cell parameters, an important aspect to know the physical dimensions
of CTC, were determined using the least-squares fit of 25 machine-centered
reflections. Analytical absorption correction was used for Lorentz
and polarization correction for the intensity data. Reflections were
collected through empirical absorption correction using XPREP with
SADABS.32,33 The structure was solved through SIR-92
and SHELXL 97 methods refined by full-matrix least-squares methods
based on F2, minimizing the function ∑w(|Fo| – |Fc|)2; here, the calculated and observed structures
were denoted by FC and FO, respectively. Interoperating the ideal geometries and
with no further refinements, the position of hydrogen atoms was calculated,
while anisotropic refinement was conducted for the calculation of
all of the nonhydrogen atoms. The refined model is satisfactorily
precise for the explanation of the structure of the complexes. The
convergence was measured by the factors R and RW, where R = R∑ (||FO| – |FC||)/∑R|FO and RW = {∑[w(Fo2 – Fc2)2]}1/2. The bond lengths
of free moieties (IM and PA) and their CT complex were compared. The
experimental details of the crystal data, intensity measurements,
and structure solution for CT complex are shown in Tables 1 and S1, Supporting Information. The publication CCDC No. of the crystal
is 1887652.

4.2.2 Fluorescence Properties
Synthesized
CTC of 10–4 M concentration solution was prepared
in different solvents (dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)/3H2O,
ethanol, methanol, acetonitrile, water, carbontetrachloride (CCl4), dichloromethane (DCM)) for conducting fluorescence using
Instrument model F-2700 FL Spectrophotometer upon excitation of 350
nm, keeping a slit width of 20.0 nm for source as well as detector
when dealing with NB, and 20.0 nm for source and 10.0 nm for detector
when dealing with Co2+. Further, to record the change in
intensity of fluorescence, incremental additions of the freshly prepared
analyte solution in CTC solution were done.

4.3 Computational Details
4.3.1 TD/DFT Calculations
Gaussian 03
program34 was used for TD/TD-DFT calculations.
The MM2 method was used for obtaining the energy-minimized structures
of IM, PA, and IM–PA complex. They were administrated individually
to a full geometrical optimization using Becke’s three-parameter
hybrid exchange function and DFT in aggregation with the gradient-corrected
correlation functional having Pople basis set as 6-31G** (B3LYP/6-31G**).35−37

4.3.2 Hirshfeld Surface Analyses
CrystalExplorer
3.138 was employed for mapping Hirshfeld
surfaces with partitioning space in the crystal and 2D fingerprint
plots. CrystalExplorer 3.1 is applicable as a tool for visualizing
the intermolecular interactions in crystal packing.39 Electron distribution of the sum over crystal to the interrelated
spherical atom for the promolecule or molecule ratio in a crystal
is assigned as a region of Hirshfeld surface around a molecule. Two
distances as de and di are given as Hirshfeld isosurface points, which are
the distances from the nearest nucleus, which is external to the surface
from the point, and the distance from the nearest nucleus internal
to the surface, respectively. The value of dnorm (normalized contact distance) based on di and de is given by  where the van der Waals radii are given by revdW and rivdW of the atoms. Intermolecular contacts may be shorter
or longer than van der Waals separations,40 which can give the dnorm value as negative
or positive. The color scheme as red-white-blue displays as the dnorm parameter, where shorter contacts are indicated
by bright red spots, white areas signify van der Waals contacts separation,
and blue areas lacking close contacts.
