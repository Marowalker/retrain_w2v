Diagnostic tests based on proteomics
analysis can have significant
advantages over more traditional biochemical tests. However, low molecular
weight (MW) protein biomarkers are difficult to identify by standard
mass spectrometric analysis, as they are usually present at low concentrations
and are masked by more abundant resident proteins. We have previously
shown that mesoporous silica nanoparticles are able to capture a predominantly
low MW protein fraction from the serum, as compared to the protein
corona (PC) adsorbed onto dense silica nanoparticles. In this study,
we begin by further investigating this effect using liquid chromatography–mass
spectrometry (LC–MS)/MS and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
to compare the MW of the proteins in the coronas of mesoporous silica
nanoparticles with the same particle size but different pore diameters.
Next, we examine the process by which two proteins, one small and
one large, adsorb onto these mesoporous silica nanoparticles to establish
a theory of why the corona becomes enriched in low MW proteins. Finally,
we use this information to develop a novel system for the diagnosis
of prostate cancer. An elastic net statistical model was applied to
LC–MS/MS protein coronas from the serum of 22 cancer patients,
identifying proteins specific to each patient group. These studies
help to explain why low MW proteins predominate in the coronas of
mesoporous silica nanoparticles, and they illustrate the ability of
this information to supplement more traditional diagnostic tests.

Introduction
The early diagnosis
of cancer is one of the most important goals
of current medicine, and in the last two decades significant progress
has been made in understanding the molecular processes involved in
the origin and evolution of cancer.1 Recently,
efforts have been made to use modern techniques such as proteomics
and genomics to isolate, identify, and quantify specific molecules,
that is, prognostic factors or biomarkers, that are closely related
to a specific clinical outcome (in the absence of therapy).2 Many protein and peptide biomarkers belong to
the low MW serum protein fraction (e.g. MW below 50 kDa) and their
isolation by standard MS analysis is mostly unfeasible, as these low
MW species are usually in low concentration and are masked by large
quantities of resident proteins, such as immunoglobulins and albumin.3 Furthermore, most of these “small”
proteins are especially sensitive to enzymatic degradation following
collection, making their identification and determination difficult.4 Consequently, there is need for techniques that
allow selective isolation, quantitative estimation, and statistical
validation of the low MW proteins in the specific proteome assigned
to a disease. In this context, we recently published several reports
showing that the composition of the protein corona (PC) on porous
nanoparticles is different from the corona adsorbed onto dense nanoparticles
of the same size and composition.5,6 Specifically,
porous nanoparticles retain significantly more low MW proteins (<50
kDa) from serum. Using stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy
(STORM), we showed that small proteins have a better fit within the
pores and are able to access the internal surface areas of the nanoparticles,
while large proteins are mainly restricted to the external surface.7 Qualitative co-adsorption studies using one small
and one large protein also showed that the presence of the small protein
reduces the amount of large protein able to bind. We hypothesized
that the small protein rapidly accesses and fills the pores, while
the large protein must undergo restructuring (a high energy process)
to fit into the pores, and consequently becomes rapidly excluded from
them.

The ability to specifically capture the low MW fraction
of serum
proteins provides a unique opportunity to diagnose certain disease
states using a simple blood draw and proteomics. Protein biomarker
discovery and quantification by mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful
tool, but it is severely limited due to the intrinsic complexity of
human serum samples.8,9 The isolation of low MW biomarkers
by standard MS analysis is mostly unfeasible, as they are usually
present at low concentrations and are masked by more abundant resident
proteins, such as immunoglobulins and albumin.3 Furthermore, most of these small proteins are particularly sensitive
to enzymatic degradation after collection, making their identification
difficult.4 Albeit nanoparticles modified
with different chemical groups have been used to selectively bind
low-abundance proteins and peptides,10 it
is optimistic to think that a single molecule is indicative of a pathologic
state. Huo and co-workers developed a diagnostic test for early stage
prostate cancer (PCa) based on the amount of human immunoglobulin
G (IgG) retained in the PC of citrate-capped gold nanoparticles.11,12 This blood test is a significant advance over the currently clinically
used prostate specific antigen (PSA) analysis, but it could be seriously
affected by selectivity issues, as many pathological states can increase
blood IgG concentration. Instead, analysis of the entire PC adsorbed
onto porous nanoparticles by MS could reveal patterns of protein up
and down regulation throughout the low MW proteome in the disease
state versus the normal state. At this point, Mahmoudi and co-workers
recently introduced the concept of a personalized PC (PPC) as a pattern
linked to physiological conditions.13 This
PPC could have a dramatic impact in cancer diagnosis, as many proteins
change their plasmatic profile. In this sense, the sequestration of
proteins in the nanoparticle PC could be used to detect low-abundant
proteins related to tumorigenesis.14 In
this line, Huo and co-workers also pointed out that nanoparticle corona
proteomic analysis may reveal molecular profile differences between
cancer and healthy serum samples,12 although
no specific protocols and patterns were given to confirm such differences
with statistical evidence. Moreover, Caracciolo and co-workers used
lipid nanoparticles to isolate the PC from pancreatic cancer patient
serum samples. Then, they characterized the different proteomic patterns
by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and, using principal component analysis (PCA) and linear discriminant
analysis, they obtained statistically significant differences between
the healthy and the cancer groups.15

Our goal for the current set of experiments was threefold. First,
we sought to compare the extent of protein adsorption on a set of
nanoparticles with the same well-defined shapes and sizes but different
pore diameters. Previously, we focused on materials with essentially
the same pore diameter but with other properties that differed (particle
size, surface modification, etc.). Second, we quantitatively compared
the amount of a single small and large protein adsorbed onto the nanoparticle
when both were present throughout the adsorption process versus when
the large protein was given a “head start”, that is,
the proteins were added sequentially with the small protein added
last. Finally, we sought to develop a proteomic test based on the
low MW proteins in porous nanoparticle coronas to show that the low
MW proteomes of patients with various stages of PCa are statistically
different from those of control patients, and that this information
can be used to distinguish one patient group from another.

Results
and Discussion
We previously showed that the nanoparticle
size has an influence
on protein adsorption, with small nanoparticles adsorbing more total
protein than large ones.6 To minimize this
effect and limit differences in protein adsorption to the porosity
of each material, we prepared nanoparticles with diameters that were
as similar as possible (see Table 1 and Figure S1). Dense,
nonporous silica nanoparticles (“SNP”) with a particle
size of ∼120 nm as determined by transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) (Figure 1) were
prepared by modifying the Stobër method.16 The particle size was confirmed by dynamic light scattering
(DLS); the polydispersity of this material and of the mesoporous nanoparticles
indicated reasonably consistent particle sizes throughout each sample.
Standard mesoporous silica nanoparticles (“MSN”) with
a hexagonally ordered pore structure similar to that of MCM-41, with dpore = 2.7 nm and approximately the same particle
size as SNPs were prepared by polymerizing silicate monomers in the
presence of surfactant micelles.17 Large-pore
silica (“LPS”) nanoparticles with increasing dpore = 4.8, 6.2, 7.4, and 14 nm were prepared
using a previously published procedure.18 These materials, with FDU-12 structure type narrow channels that
connect larger cavities,19 were used because
retaining the particle size of all materials used in this study was
of primary importance. Cavity sizes in LPS nanoparticles are noted
in Table 1 and were
in the range 15.5–24.5 nm, significantly larger than the pore
interconnections; thus, the limiting factor in protein adsorption
onto these particles should be the pore diameter. In addition to the
particle size, the zeta potentials for SNP, MSN, and LPS materials
were also nearly the same, ranging from −12.0 to −16.4
mV. These values are mainly dependent on the synthesis method, and
in the case of the porous nanoparticles, are related to the removal
of the surfactant by extraction. Characterization of the nanoparticles
using N2 physisorption showed that the surface areas (SBET) of the porous nanoparticles decreased as
the pore diameter increased, as expected for these materials (Table 1, Figures S2 and S3). The pore volumes ranged from 0.60 to 0.92
cm3/g, indicating highly porous MSN and LPS nanoparticles.

Dependence
of Serum Protein Adsorption on the Pore Diameter
Protein
adsorption studies from whole serum were performed by separately
suspending each type of nanoparticle in human serum for 1 h, followed
by centrifugation to collect the nanoparticles and washing to remove
any loosely adsorbed proteins. The total protein adsorbed was obtained
by TGA (Table 2).

As expected, the mass of
the protein adsorbed was correlated with the surface area of the nanoparticles;
materials with larger surface areas generally retained more protein.
However, when the specific adsorption (i.e., the mass of protein per
unit surface area) was calculated, the nanoparticles could be separated
into two groups. Although SNP did not adsorb much protein, the specific
adsorption was much higher than that for porous nanoparticles, which
adsorbed nearly 4–7 times as much total protein but which had
a much lower specific adsorption. When the pore diameter increased
to 14 nm, the specific adsorption returned to a value similar to that
for the dense materials (0.83 vs 0.77). This information supports
a model in which a number of proteins present in serum are too large
to access the internal surface area of mesoporous silica nanoparticles
with pore diameters less than approximately 7 nm, leading to a PC
that is significantly different from that on either dense nanoparticles
or nanoparticles with large pores, the latter defined by our data
as nanoparticles with pore diameters 14 nm or larger.

A preliminary
assessment of the content of the PCs on the nanoparticles
was obtained by gel electrophoresis (Figure S4). The low protein content of the dense nanoparticles is apparent
from the lack of significant protein bands which, as it will be shown
later on, correspond to a few proteins, mostly apolipoproteins and
albumin. The porous nanoparticles all showed more proteins, and qualitatively,
the bands associated with apolipoprotein A-1 and A-II are significantly
more prominent in these samples than the bands associated with albumin.
The most important difference between the coronas from dense and porous
nanoparticles is the addition of proteins with MW < 50 kDa in the
latter case. More detailed analysis of the content of the PCs of these
particles is shown by proteomic analysis (Figure 2 and Table S1).
Using the normalized spectral counts (NSpC) provided by liquid chromatography–MS
(LC–MS) analysis gave the relative percent of each identified
protein; multiplying this percentage by the mass of the total PC adsorbed
onto each type of particle, as determined by TGA, gave the mass of
each identified protein adsorbed onto the particles. These values
(NSpC × TGA) were collected into four distinct MW ranges for
clarity and plotted as a function of the pore diameter.

Figure 2 Protein adsorption
onto silica nanoparticles from human serum as
a function of the pore diameter. (a) Percentage of different MW fractions
in the PC. (b) Specific protein adsorption per unit surface area of
the different MW fractions. The mass of each protein in the coronas
of the nanoparticles was determined by multiplying the NSpC obtained
from liquid chromatography tandem-mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS)
with the total mass of the PC obtained from TGA. For the sake of clarity,
error bars have been omitted in the figure, but the information is
provided in Table S1.

In the PCs of all nanoparticles, at least 90% of the protein
mass
consisted of proteins with MW < 70 kDa (Figure 2a). However, excluding serum albumin (MW
= 69 kDa) and proteins with MW above 50 kDa highlighted the difference
between dense and porous nanoparticles. The coronas of porous nanoparticles
still consisted primarily of low MW proteins, with 80–85% of
the total mass coming from proteins with MW < 50 kDa. Only 65%
of the total PC mass of the dense nanoparticles came from proteins
in this group. Within the group of porous nanoparticles, there was
a rough trend that correlated to the pore diameter, with the smallest
fraction of proteins <50 kDa associated with the material with
the largest pores (LPS-4, 14 nm). Plotting the data in terms of specific
adsorption (i.e., mass of proteins adsorbed in each category per unit
surface area) highlighted the difference between LPS-4 and the other
porous materials (Figure 2b). The total specific protein adsorption for LPS-4 and dense
nanoparticles was similar to each other and different from that of
the other porous nanoparticles, as shown in Table 2. However, the specific adsorption of proteins
in the 50–70 kDa range for LPS-4 was also more similar to that
of the dense nanoparticle sample than to that of the other porous
samples. Thus, we can conclude that it was easier for proteins with
masses above 50 kDa and particularly between 50 and 70 kDa to access
the internal pore surfaces of porous nanoparticles with a very large
pore diameter (e.g., 14 nm). This highlights the size discrimination
effect due to the pore diameters of porous nanoparticles and provides
some explanation for the predominance of low MW proteins in the coronas
of porous nanoparticles. Finally, for additional specific details
about the PCs adsorbed from total serum, we created a heat map comparing
adsorption data for the 24 most abundant proteins (NSpC × TGA
> 1 mg/g, Figure 3).
The predominance of only a few types of proteins, namely apolipoproteins,
is apparent. The complete proteomic profiles are shown in Table S2.

in the coronas of silica
nanoparticles. The 24 most abundant proteins (NSpC × TGA >
1
mg/g SiO2) across the entire data set of all identified
proteins were organized according to the MW, and the data were presented
as a heat map (scale shown at right of figure). The mass of apolipoprotein
A-I on MSN through LPS-4 was 90.8, 78.9, 59.4, 65.1, and 71.7 mg/g
SiO2 and is represented in red in the heat map.

Influence of the Pore Diameter on the Competitive
Adsorption
of Representative Small and Large Proteins
Having developed
a model of protein adsorption onto porous nanoparticles, we next examined
the effect of pore diameter on the adsorption of two specific proteins
that are representative of “small” and “large”
proteins: apolipoprotein A-II (abbreviated A-II) has a mass of 11.2
kDa and was one of the most prominent low MW proteins identified and
complement C3 (abbreviated simply C3) was the largest protein of the
group of 24 proteins identified in Figure 3. These two proteins were the subject of
experiments we previously reported, where we used the STORM technique
to provide qualitative observation of adsorption by fluorescence microscopy
and calculating the relative penetration depths of each protein.7 Our results pointed out that when A-II and C3
were both present in the same solution, the adsorption of C3 was qualitatively
much less than when C3 was the only protein in the solution. This
may have occurred because when C3 was the only protein in the solution,
some of it was able to bind near the pore entrances, but when A-II
was present, A-II rapidly bound to the internal pore surfaces, blocking
the pores and reducing the overall amount of C3 able to bind. According
to this hypothesis, the pore diameter should have a significant effect
on both the total amount of protein bound and the relative amounts
of A-II and C3.

To study the effect of the pore diameter on
the competitive adsorption of A-II and C3, we performed a series of
protein adsorption experiments: C3 only, A-II only, C3 and A-II together
in the same solution (represented as C3 + A-II), and finally C3 adsorbed
first for 1 h followed by A-II (i.e., sequential adsorption of proteins
that gave C3 a “head start”, represented as C3 →
A-II). The results are summarized in Figure 4, where specific adsorption is plotted as
a function of pore diameter. First, we found that the total specific
protein adsorption increased with the pore diameter (Figure 4a), as expected from our previous
experiments described above. In general, the total protein adsorption
was the highest when C3 was given a head start, consistent with the
hypothesis above because C3 binds to the pore entrances and external
surfaces, and then A-II is able to bind to other surface sites to
increase the overall mass of the adsorbed protein. In addition, whatever
the pore size, it must be taken into account that both A-II and C3
present isoelectric points lower than 7 (respectively, 6.62 and 6.40),
and negative effective charge at physiological pH (respectively −0.3
and −16.5), which means that electrostatic repulsion may happen
even in the solution, limiting total adsorption. For materials with
small pores, simultaneous adsorption of C3 and A-II did not result
in as much adsorbed protein, because A-II prevented C3 from accessing
pore entrance sites and because C3 weighs over 10 times as much as
A-II, this significantly reduced the amount of adsorbed protein. The
exception came for LPS-4, with the largest pore diameter, where the
total amount of protein adsorbed was the same regardless of whether
or not C3 and A-II were both present throughout the adsorption process.
This can be rationalized by the fact that here, C3 is more fully able
to access the internal porosity of the nanoparticles because the pores
are much larger than those of the other materials.

protein adsorption of a representative heavy
protein (complement C3) and light protein (apolipoprotein A-II) onto
silica nanoparticles. “C3” = complement C3 alone; “A-II”
= apolipoprotein A-II alone; “C3 + A-II” = complement
C3 and apolipoprotein A-II in the same solution; “C3 →
A-II” = sequential adsorption, i.e. complement C3 adsorbed
first for 1 h, followed by apolipoprotein A-II. (a) Total specific
adsorption of A-II and C3 proteins. (b) Specific adsorption of A-II
or C-3 portions.

We also applied proteomic
analysis to these samples to study the
relative amounts of C3 and A-II adsorbed in each material as determined
by NSpC × TGA (Figure 4b). For MSN, LPS-1, and LPS-2, with pore diameters of 2.7,
4.8, and 6.2 nm, respectively, the specific adsorption of C3 was very
low regardless of whether the proteins were added simultaneously or
sequentially. There was notably more C3 adsorbed in LPS-3 and LPS-4
(7.4 and 14 nm pore diameters), and for these samples, there was clearly
more C3 adsorbed when it was added to the solution before A-II instead
of being added simultaneously. This result indicated that C3 is able
to adsorb more successfully when it does not compete with A-II for
access to the internal surface area. A-II, on the other hand, was
present in all samples regardless of the pore diameter although there
was a notable switch in the amount of A-II adsorbed in the C3 + A-II
experiment versus C3 → A-II. For materials with the smallest
pores, that is, MSN, LPS-1, and LPS-2, more A-II adsorbed when it
was added sequentially after C3 rather than simultaneously. The fact
that there was any difference at all in these materials showed that
even though there was very little C3 present, it still had an influence
on the adsorption of A-II. When the pores were large enough to allow
significant amounts of C3 to bind (LPS-3 and LPS-4), more A-II was
adsorbed during simultaneous addition of proteins. This indicates
that when C3 is able to enter the pores, it blocks them and decreases
the diffusion of A-II within the pores to adsorption sites, promoting
adsorption on their external surfaces; thus, less A-II binds when
C3 is given a head start. On the other hand, when the pores are too
small for appreciable amounts of C3 to enter, more A-II binds when
it does not compete directly for adsorption sites near the pore entrances
in the same solution. In addition, the latter result may also indicate
that some exchange occurs between adsorbed C3 near the pore entrances
and A-II. Overall, the results of these experiments showed that the
sizes of the adsorbed proteins depended strongly on the pore diameter,
and that they were also sensitive to the presence of other proteins
in the solution.

Design of a Diagnostic Test for Prostate
Cancer Development
Using the Protein Corona of Mesoporous Silica Nanoparticles
It was apparent from the TGA data in Table 2 that the material with the largest surface
area (MSN) adsorbed the most protein. As our other results above have
shown, MSN also had the largest fraction of low MW proteins: more
than 95% of the total protein mass in the corona consisted of proteins
with MW < 70 kDa. Therefore, we chose this material as a “nano-concentrator”
to demonstrate an application involving proteomic analysis of the
PC to develop a diagnostic test for the progression of PCa. We began
by optimizing the physical properties of the MSN required to obtain
the highest possible fraction from human serum samples. MSN were prepared
similar to the experiments mentioned above, and the particles’
surfaces were modified with different organic moieties (amine, carboxylate,
or thiol). In all cases, highly porous nanoparticles were obtained
(Table 3). After protein
adsorption using human serum and quantitative analysis by LC–MS/MS
and TGA, we clearly observed that thiol-derivatized MSN (“MSN-SH”)
retained the largest amount of low MW proteins (Figure S5). This is consistent with previously published work,
as the strongly hydrophobic character of thiol-modified silica materials
favored interactions with the hydrophobic pockets present on protein
surfaces as well as the formation of disulfide bridges.10,20 For this reason, we selected MSN-SH for subsequent studies of the
PCs from serum samples of PCa patients.

Since the late 1980s, PSA-based testing has been widely
used for
PCa detection. However, overdiagnosis and overtreatment occur frequently,
involving serious side effects and unnecessary clinical expenses.
Often, these problems are a result of the fact that PSA levels may
also be elevated in healthy men, as PSA is prostate-specific but not
PCa-specific. Indeed, meta-analyses show that in patients with PSA
levels above 4 ng/mL, the positive predictive value of PSA is only
about 25%.21 Moreover, second biopsies
can detect cancer in 15–34% of patients whose first biopsy
was negative.22 A recent U.S. preventive
services task force recommended against PSA-based screening for PCa
in all age groups, highlighting the need for new, clinically-useful,
biomarkers.23,24

We sought to study the
low MW proteomes of patients with various
stages of PCa, using their PSA levels and biopsy status to divide
them into groups and to provide a method of comparing the relative
amounts of each protein from group to group. For this purpose, blood
samples were taken from 22 patients from the following groups: metastatic
PCa (“M” group, 4 patients); elevated PSA and positive
biopsy for PCa (“B+” group, 6 patients); elevated PSA
and negative biopsy (“B–” group, 7 patients);
age-matched control patients with normal PSA levels (“C”
group, 5 patients). Adsorption experiments were carried out over MSN-SH
and subsequent analysis of the PC by LC–MS/MS and TGA showed
a complex mixture of proteins with the MW ranging from 5 to 515 kDa,
with 344 different protein assignments over the entire set of patient
sera (Table S3). All proteins were organized
by the mass of each protein contained in each patient’s corona,
as calculated by NSpC × TGA, and statistical analysis using principal
component analysis (PCA) was performed. According to PCA, the first
three components of the proteomic distribution in different patient
groups were represented in a tri-coordinate projection system (Figure S6). Then, to determine individual proteomes
(which may correspond to the real PPC as described before),13,14 predictor variables associated with the four different patient groups
were estimated by using an elastic net penalized multinomial regression
model, and a total of 51 proteins were identified as model components.
The combinations of the levels of these 51 proteins were sufficient
to define the four groups; these data are presented in Figure 5a as a heat map.

identification of proteins unique to each patient group
after adsorbing serum proteins from patients onto thiol-modified mesoporous
silica nanoparticles (MSN-SH). Patient groups are defined in the text.
(a) Z-score differences (±4SD) corresponding to selected variables
obtained by the elastic net penalized multinomial regression model
for 51 identified proteins were clustered into groups based on correlation
in their relative abundance (Pearson correlation coefficients). A
heat map (scale at left of figure) was then generated from the Z-score
data. Proteins present in a larger amount in a particular patient
sample are in green; those in a smaller amount are in red. (b) 3D
plot of the heat map, emphasizing groups of proteins unique to each
patient group, based on Z-score data.

The data in this figure are presented as a “Z-score”,
which is the number of standard deviations (SD) above (green) or below
(red) the average value of the mass of a particular protein in each
corona. A 3D representation of the heat map (Figure 5b) revealed that all PCa groups showed unique
proteomic clusters, making it potentially feasible to quickly assign
each patient to a particular diagnostic group. Many of the identified
proteins belong to the low MW fraction, where a significant number
of proteins whose serum concentration is severely affected by the
pathological stage are expected to be found.8 Indeed, some of these proteins are strongly related to cancer development,
such as plasma serine protease inhibitor in metastasis and positive
biopsy patients (inhibits tissue- and urinary-type plasminogen activators,
prostate-specific antigens, and kallikrein activities). Other detected
up and down-regulated proteins with reported potential as cancer biomarkers
are identified in Table S4.25

With proteomics data in hand, the predictive
value of the model
was tested by applying the elastic net model coefficients to the data
of each patient.19 That is, each patient’s
proteomics information was processed through the model without any
bias as to their clinical diagnosis, and a prediction was made as
to the probability of their assignment to a specific group. The results
(Table 4) showed that
patient assignments made from proteomics matched the clinical assignment
quite well, with probabilities of matching assignments ranging from
49 to 78%. Importantly, the difference between the probability of
being in the clinically assigned group versus the other groups was
sizable. For example, patients with clinical assignments of B–
(elevated PSA but negative biopsy) had a probability of 67% of being
assigned to the B– group from proteomics data, but only a probability
of 14% of being assigned to the B+ group; patients with B+ clinical
assignments (elevated PSA and positive biopsy) had a probability of
59% of being assigned to the B+ group but only 17% probability of
assignment to the B– group.

PCa biopsy; B–, elevated PSA, negative PCa biopsy = negative
biopsy; C, normal PSA (age-matched control). PSA = prostate-specific
antigen.

c Prediction based
solely on proteomics
data.

The distinction between
B– and B+ patients is of special
significance because the predictive value of the PSA test alone is
only ∼25%. Instead, an initial screening with a PSA test followed
by proteomics using MSN-SH, which only requires an additional blood
sample, provides a simple predictive tool to avoid unnecessary, costly,
and invasive biopsies. This is especially relevant to clearly discriminate
patients with elevated PSA levels due to prostatitis or benign prostate
hyperplasia from those with lethal forms of PCa. Conversely, continued
monitoring of patients with elevated PSA levels using proteomics could
also allow early intervention, for example, when assignment to the
B+ group becomes indicated. The data set here is small and the information
presented is preliminary; however, the probability difference between
correct and incorrect assignments will only increase as more patients
are added to the model and additional proteomics information is collected.
This is the focus of our current studies.

Conclusions
We
have shown that low MW proteins dominate the PCs of mesoporous
silica nanoparticles, an effect that is more pronounced with small
pore diameters. When the surface areas of each type of particle are
taken into account by comparing the specific protein adsorption (protein
adsorbed per unit surface area), silica nanoparticles with the largest
pore diameter studied (14 nm) had PCs with very similar compositions
to those of dense silica nanoparticles. This indicated that the protein
size discrimination capability is most pronounced when the pore diameter
is below 7.4 nm. Comparing the adsorption patterns of a representative
low MW protein (apolipoprotein A-II) and a high MW protein (complement
C3), we found that in silica nanoparticles with small pores, A-II
diffuses easily within the pores while C3 does not. Interestingly,
although only a small amount of C3 bound to small-pore silica nanoparticles,
it still influenced the adsorbed quantity of A-II bound. In particles
with larger pores, each protein was able to bind more successfully
when the other was not present. These competitive adsorption experiments
showed that in addition to the expected size exclusion effect on protein
adsorption, there is still competition for surface adsorption sites.
Finally, thiol-modified medium pore silica nanoparticles (MSN-SH)
were used to adsorb proteins from sera of PCa patients, patients with
elevated PSA but without PCa, and control patients. Application of
a statistical model to the complete set of proteomics data allowed
groups of proteins to be preliminarily identified as markers of each
patient’s status. The proteomics and clinical assessments showed
very good agreement, and the proteomics assignations had the added
advantage of discriminating between patients with elevated PSA due
to PCa and patients with elevated PSA for another reason. These experiments
provide additional insight into the development of the PCs on MSNs,
and illustrate how this information can be usefully applied to a diagnostic
test.

corresponding to preparation of dense silica nanoparticles (SNPs),
medium pore silica nanoparticles (MSNs), and large pore silica nanoparticles
(LPSs), as well as surface modification with organic groups are fully

physico-chemical characterization are also described in the Supporting Information.

Human Serum Protein Adsorption
Experiments
Prior to
serum exposure, particles (1 mg) were suspended in 0.5 mL phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) (1×, pH 7.4). Subsequently, the serum sample (0.5
mL) was added and the mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C
and 1500 rpm in a ThermoMixer. Next, the protein-adsorbed particles
were isolated through centrifugation at 14800 rpm at 4 °C for
5 min. Then, the supernatant was discarded and nanoparticles were
resuspended in PBS (1 mL) and sonicated. This process was repeated
three times in order to ensure that any free or loosely bound proteins
were removed from the solution. After removal of the final PBS wash,
nanoparticles containing the hard corona were suspended in digestion
buffer (36 μL, 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate, 0.25 mM urea, 4%
acetonitrile) and reducing buffer (6 μL, 100 mM dithiothreitol
in H2O). These nanoparticle suspensions were allowed to
incubate for 1 h at 70 °C. After 1 h, alkylation buffer (15 μL,
100 mM iodoacetamide) was added and the samples were incubated at
room temperature for 20 min in a dark place. Protein digestion was
achieved by adding trypsin (15 μL, 40 ng/μL) and incubating
overnight at 37 °C. The following morning, formic acid (15 μL,
10%) was added to stop the digestion process. Prior to submitting
the samples for proteomic analysis, the nanoparticles were centrifuged
out of solution and the supernatant was submitted for analysis.

Single Protein Adsorption Experiments
Nanoparticles
(1 mg) were suspended in 0.5 mL PBS (1×, pH 7.4). The particle
suspension was then sonicated to disperse any aggregates. Subsequently,
the suspension was diluted to a final concentration of 1 mg/mL with
PBS containing apolipoprotein AII (40 μg/mL) and/or complement
C3 protein (40 μg/mL). Proteins were supplied by Athens Research
& Technologies. The adsorption proceeded for 1 h before isolating
the particle–protein conjugates via centrifugation (1 min,
14 800 rpm). The protein adsorbed sample was then re-suspended
in PBS (1 mL), sonicated, and centrifuged. This process was repeated
three times in order to remove any loosely bound protein. In the case
of sequential adsorption, C3 was adsorbed first for 1 h. Then, the
supernatant was removed by centrifugation (1 min, 14 800 rpm)
and the sample was washed three times with PBS as above. Afterwards,
A-II adsorption was carried out for 1 h, and the protein–particle
conjugate was separated and washed again three times with PBS. Subsequently,
hard corona was extracted and analyzed as described above.

Proteomic
Analysis
Prior to the MS/MS technique, preliminary
characterization of the PC composition by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE
was performed, and details are presented in the Supporting Information. Subsequently, for the proteomic analysis,
samples were subjected to desalting and concentration by μC18 ZipTip (Millipore) according to the manufacturer protocol.
5 μL of each sample were loaded onto a trap column (NanoLC Column,
3μ C18-CL, 350 μm × 0.5 mm; Eksigen) and
desalted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid at 3 μL/min for 5 min.
The peptides were then loaded onto an analytical column (LC Column,
3 μC18-CL, 75 mm × 12 cm, Nikkyo) equilibrated
in 5% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid. Elution was carried out with
a linear gradient of 5–35% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid
at a flow rate of 300 nL/min for 30 min. Peptides were analysed in
a mass spectrometer nanoESI-qQTOF (6600 TripleTOF, AB SCIEX). A tripleTOF
was operated in information-dependent acquisition mode, in which a
0.26 s TOF MS scan from 350 to 1250 m/z was performed, followed by 0.05 s product ion scans from 100 to
1600 m/z on the 50 most intense
2–5 charged ions. The system sensitivity was controlled with
2 fmol of 6 proteins (LC Packings). ProteinPilot 5.0 search engine
(AB SCIEX) default parameters were used to generate a peak list directly
from 6600 Triple TOF .wiff files. The paragon algorithm of ProteinPilot
5.0 was used to search the ExPASy protein database (616203 sequences;
181334896 residues) with the following parameters: trypsin specificity,
cys-alkylation, taxonomy restricted to human, and the search effort
set to through. To avoid using the same spectral evidence in more
than one protein, the identified proteins are grouped based on MS/MS
spectra by the ProteinPilot Pro Group algorithm. Thus, proteins sharing
MS/MS spectra are grouped, regardless of the peptide sequence assigned.
The protein within each group that can explain more spectral data
with confidence is shown as the primary protein of the group. Only
the proteins of the group for which there is individual evidence (unique
peptides with enough confidence) are also listed, usually toward the
end of the protein list. Protein identification was performed according
to ProtScore units (eq 1). Here, proteins showing unused score >1.3 were identified with
confidence ≥96%, and proteins showing identification confidence
less than 96% were eliminated. 1  

Calculation of Mass % of Individual Proteins
LC–MS/MS
analysis of adsorbed proteins was carried in triplicate. In order
to obtain a unique intensity signal for each identified protein, the
signals obtained from all peptides that make up the protein were summed.
Then, the NSpC for each protein, which represent the percentage of
each protein identified in the proteomic analysis as a function of
MW, were multiplied by the overall mass of adsorbed protein as determined
by TGA. The result of this calculation (NSpC × TGA, eqs 2 and 3) is
the contribution of each protein to the total adsorbed mass.26 SD were determined from these values. 2   3  

Patient Selection and Clinical
Sample Extraction
This
study was conducted with the approval of the Ethics Committee of La
Fe Hospital (Valencia, Spain). Informed consent was obtained from
all cases for the examinations and experiments conducted. Clinical
materials were used after written informed consent was obtained, according
to protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board of La Fe Hospital.

Between January and February 2015, 17 patients were referred to
the Department of Urology at La Fe Hospital for further evaluation
of suspected PCa based on an abnormal digital rectal examination and/or
an elevated serum PSA concentration.27 During
the study period, 17 transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsies were
performed with an ultrasound system (Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen,
Germany). An extended 10-core systematic random biopsy was performed
using an automatic spring-loaded gun biopsy device with an 18-gauge
needle, and the Gleason score and TNM adscription were established
in all patients.27,28 Also, a computer tomography scan
was performed in patients suspected of metastasis (PSA > 25 ng/mL).
In parallel, 5 extra patients were selected as controls. Controls
were defined as men who had been followed at least for 5 years on
study with no PCa diagnosis. Blood samples from all patients were
collected the same day that biopsies were scheduled in Vacutainer
tubes (Becton Dickinson) and centrifuged at room temperature for 15
min at 3000 g. Serum was collected from the tubes, aliquoted, and
stored at −80 °C.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis of clinical
data was performed using R software (version 3.2.2) and the R-package
glmnet (version 2.0-2).

Data Pretreatment
Data were summarized
by mean, SD,
median, and first and third quartiles. Initial data exploration was
performed using PCA.29 Moreover, identified
proteins were clustered into groups based on correlation to their
relative abundance (Pearson correlation coefficients), and variables
with zero variance were excluded. A total of 187 proteins were clustered
in a heat map.

Elastic Net Penalized Multinomial Regression
Model
Association of the predictor variables with the four
different patient
groups was assessed using an elastic net penalized multinomial regression
model.30 Elastic net penalization allows
for variable selection by shrinking the coefficients of the variables
not related to the response to zero. Thus, variables with non-zero
coefficients are considered as important predictors. Selection of
the shrinkage parameter (lambda) for the elastic net model was performed
by twenty repetitions of 10-fold cross-validation. The one-standard-error
rule was used. The results of the elastic net model were depicted
in a heat map including only the selected variables. Finally, the
probability (Pr) to ascribe the corresponding patient to a specific
PCa group was calculated through the minimum error model.30

Model Validation
An internal model
validation was performed
using 1000 iterations of bootstrapping. Optimism-corrected kappa statistic
was 0.58 and accuracy was 0.69.
