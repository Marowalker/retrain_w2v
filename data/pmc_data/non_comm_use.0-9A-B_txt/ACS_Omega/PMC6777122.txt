We
report a unique phenomenon of physical adsorption of coumarin
6-β-cyclodextrin (C6-β-CD) inclusion nanostructures on
graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, thus inducing ground-state electron
transfer from the C6-β-CD composite to GO. On excitation, the
C6-β-CD composite initially transfers energy to the attached
GO surface and subsequently collides with similar C6-β-CD@GO
adducts leading to dynamic quenching of energy. The ground-state two-electron
transfer process has been confirmed by cyclic voltammetry in aqueous
medium, whereas the excited-state processes were inferred from steady-state
and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. The concept is developed
toward conceiving control over the ground-state electron transfer
and excited state energy transfer from the C6-β-CD composite
by the adsorbed electron accepting medium (GO in this case). The C6-β-CD
composite has been prepared to isolate single C6 molecules that readily
undergo microcrystal formation in aqueous medium. The results show
its potential toward fabrication of energy-harvesting antenna for
further applications.

Introduction
Graphene, an extremely well-studied carbon
material, is known for
its unusual magnetic, electronic, optical, and thermal properties.1−8 It also shows potential to be a useful material for solar-energy-conversion
and low-cost optoelectronic devices.9,10 Graphene can
be chemically or thermally synthesized from graphene oxide (GO).11−13 GO, on the other hand, is prepared by chemically oxidizing graphite
followed by dispersion and exfoliation in a suitable solvent.14 GO mostly contains hydroxyl and epoxy functional
groups on the basal plane, and carboxyl, carbonyl, phenol, lactone,
and quinone in small amounts at the edges of the sheet.15−17 The oxygen-containing functional groups in GO strongly affect the
inherent electronic and electrochemical properties, which distinguish
it from graphene.18 Moreover, the polarities
of the oxygen-containing functional groups make GO a strongly hydrophilic
one exhibiting good dispersive property in many organic solvents including
water.19,20 GO contributes in preparing excellent electrode
material by immobilizing various electroactive species using the surface
functionalities.15,21 Electrochemical applications
of GO-based materials have become extensively popular nowadays. These
devices are cost effective in context to the preparation of thin layers
on conventional electrodes as only a fraction of these materials is
required in this process.

Structurally, GO is different from
pristine graphene that consists
only of trigonally bonded sp2 carbon atoms.22 The GO sheet consists mostly of a hexagonal
ring-based carbon system bearing sp2 carbon atoms and also
(partly) sp3 carbons which bear the oxygen-containing functional
groups.23 The structural peculiarity has
enabled GO to accept electrons from dedicated donors. The electron-accepting
ability of GO, specifically reduced GO (rGO), has been much exploited
in the area of photocatalysis where shuffling of electrons between
the rGO host and various guests has been effectively used.24−28 In many cases enhancement in charge transport property could be
achieved using TiO2–rGO nanocomposites.24−27 Furthermore, a study on the effect of temperature on electron transfer
from a freely interacting dye to an rGO nanosheet is also reported.28 GO can be decorated with electron donor and
electron acceptor compounds for photoinduced electron transfer (PET)
procedure. Das et al. used this technique by covalently linking the
donor and acceptor molecules to the GO sheet.29 In applications on metal oxide/poly(3-hexylthiophene) hybrid solar
cells, it has been shown that rGOs enhance the charge separation.30

Recently, we have been working with a
well-known laser dye, Coumarin
6 (C6) (Figure 1).
This dye is special in the coumarin family as it contains a benzothiazole
ring with the parent moiety, which imparts donor–acceptor character
to the compound. The fluorescence quantum yield of such flexible coumarin
derivatives are reportedly low in polar solvents due to the transformation
of the fluorescent intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) state to the
non-emissive twisted ICT state.31 However,
the characteristics of C6 are even special because a new red-shifted
absorption band is observed for this compound at 500 nm in an aqueous
medium with time along with its original absorption peaking at 460
nm.32 The emission spectrum of C6 also
shows an additional shoulder at 550 nm along with the normal fluorescence
band at 530 nm upon exciting the compound at 430 nm.32 This extra band has been explained to form due to microcrystallization
of C6 in water. The microcrystal formation of C6 was reported long
back by Fery-Forgues et al.,33 which they
obtained from reprecipitation method and at a very high concentration
of the dye.34 However, we found the C6
microcrystals formed even at a much lower concentration (∼1
μM) than what reported at room temperature in aqueous environment.
This process considerably lowers the fluorescence yield of C6 with
time.32 In a series of studies, we have
shown several ways to revive the lost fluorescence of C6 in water
by using various hosts that have relatively hydrophobic cavities.32,35−37 Using biocompatible hosts, such as, β-cyclodextrin
(β-CD), micelles, proteins, and single-walled carbon nanotubes,
the microcrystalline states of C6 could be broken and the fluorescence
emission could be revived. This technique could be successfully applied
in energy transfer reactions in the excited state.36

Figure 1 Structure of C6.

It has been shown that
the rate of excited state electron transfer
is much faster compared to that of the ground-state phenomenon because
of the proximity and the resonance factors.38 Thus, adsorption of a guest system to a host, either physically
or chemically, is likely to undergo such consequences. It has also
been shown that ground-state charge transfer depends on proper alignment
in ionization potential or electron affinity.39,40 Theoretical studies on π–π complexes have revealed
that the extent of ground-state charge transfer depends on the substitution
of the donor that determines the donatability or acceptability of
electrons.40 The present work does not
merely demonstrate PET from dye to GO, but add a dual conception.
Using the above descriptions on electron transfer in the ground and
the excited states, we have exploited one of the methods to revive
C6 fluorescence in water using β-CD encapsulation combining
with the electron accepting property of GO to device a simple process
of ground-state electron transfer and excited state energy transfer.
C6 and β-CD form planar and strongly fluorescent nanoaggregates
by guest–host chemistry.32 The π–π
stacking ability of C6 has been used in physical adsorption (physisorption)
of the C6-β-CD composites on the GO surface. The electron/energy
donatability of the coumarin dye could be suitably modulated by GO
using this process. Energy transfer from coumarin to an acceptor has
been reported previously using reverse micelles41 and covalently bonded β-CD,42 but the approach reported herein is completely new and has huge
potential to be used in energy harvesting as the observations are
based on π–π interactions and noncovalent exchange.

Results
and Discussion
Spectral Characteristics
The absorption
spectrum of
C6 shows the characteristic peaks at 460 and 500 nm, the former is
for the C6 molecule and the latter for the microcrystal formed due
to aggregation (Figure 2).32 On the addition of 7 mM β-CD
to the aqueous C6 solution (having 1% ethanol as cosolvent), the absorbance
increased considerably at 460 nm along with the disappearance of the
band at 500 nm. This signifies disintegration of the C6 microcrystals
by the hydrophobic β-CD cavities and consequently encapsulating
the single C6 molecules. This behavior of C6 in water and β-CD
has been reported and explained earlier by us in detail.32,35 Interestingly, the absorbance decreases on gradual addition of GO.
The results indicate profuse interaction of the C6-β-CD composites
with the GO sheets. We mention the C6 and β-CD complex as “C6-β-CD
composites” as the product does not have a simple 1:1 or 1:2
guest–host stoichiometry, but a nanostructure formed by self-accumulation
of the individual 1:2 C6-β-CD through hydrogen bonding at the
outer rims of the CDs.32,35

Figure 2 Absorption spectrum of 1 μM C6 (black)
in water showing the
bands for C6 monomer (olive arrow) and C6 microcrystal (blue arrow).
The absorption spectrum of C6 in β-CD is shown in red (the peak
marked with a magenta arrow). The spectral change of the encapsulated
C6 due to the addition of GO is marked with a brown arrow.

Figure 2 shows
that
on the addition of GO to the C6-β-CD composite, the absorbance
decreases and saturates after adding 16 μg/mL of GO to the solution
where the absorption spectrum remained practically unchanged on further
addition of GO. Subsequently, the fluorescence spectra were collected
by exciting the samples at 430 nm (Figure 3). The fluorescence yield of C6 in water
decreased considerably with time due to the microcrystal formation
because of aggregation of the C6 molecules.32,35 The emission spectrum is structurally broad with a shoulder at 550
nm along with the main fluorescence band at 530 nm. Application of
7 mM β-CD enhanced the fluorescence yield considerably with
the disappearance of the band at 550 nm, indicating the revival of
the lost C6 fluorescence. This has been found to be due to disintegration
of the C6 microcrystals to liberate the C6 molecules which are encapsulated
by the β-CD hosts.32 As reported
earlier, these guest–host complexes are 1:2 in nature and the
individual composites aggregate through hydrogen bonding between the
hydroxyl groups located at the periphery of β-CDs. The consequence
is the formation of planar, square, and green fluorescence nanostructures
in solution.32 Addition of GO gradually
quenches the fluorescence from the C6-β-CD nanostructures without
any shift in the emission maximum or broadening of the emission spectrum.
Thus, it can be presumed that the interaction has not destroyed the
C6-β-CD nanostructures to release C6 into the polar aqueous
bulk, but quenched the emission from the nanostructures through a
different mechanism.

addition
of GO to the aqueous solution. The inset shows the emission spectrum
of C6 in water. The samples were excited at 430 nm.

Analysis of the Quenching of C6 Fluorescence
The Stern–Volmer
plots of the quenched fluorescence data provided interesting observations
(Figure 4). The F0/F plot against the concentration
of GO was clearly bimodal. The initial part deviated upward from linearity
up to 16 μg/mL of GO and subsequently straightened to become
perfectly linear. The concept of the Stern–Volmer quenching
plot reveals that upward deviation from linearity indicates a combination
of static and dynamic quenching, whereas no such deviation indicates
the occurrence of only one type of quenching.43 The indications matched quite well with the absorption spectra (Figure 2), where we observed
change in the spectrum up to an addition of 16 μg/mL of GO to
C6-β-CD in water followed by a practically unchanged spectrum.
This shows that the species had initially suffered a static quenching
due to the formation of ground-state composites. The nonlinear Stern–Volmer
plot shows dynamic quenching of energy of the C6-β-CD@GO composites
in the excited state. The linearity appears at higher GO concentration
(beyond 20 μg/mL) due to collisional (pure dynamic) quenching
between the C6-β-CD@GO composites. This could happen, presumably,
because the adsorption of the β-CD-C6 composites over the GO
nanosheets becomes saturated, hence plenty of C6-β-CD@GO composites
become available for free collision and hence execute dynamic quenching
of fluorescence.

Figure 4 The Stern–Volmer quenching plot derived from the
emission
spectra of C6 in β-CD with the addition of GO up to 16 μg/mL.
The inset shows a similar quenching plot on the subsequent addition
of GO up to 50 μg/mL. The Stern–Volmer equation: F0/F = 1 + KSV[Q] has been used in the plots, where F0 and F are the emission maxima (500
nm) for C6-β-CD without and with GO, respectively, Fs (inset) denotes emission from C6-β-CD added with
20 μg/mL of GO. KSV is the Stern–Volmer
constant and Q is the quencher (GO in this case).

Time-Resolved Fluorescence Decay Studies
The time-resolved
emission decay studies further confirmed our hypothesis (Figure 5). The samples were
excited using a 405 nm diode laser which mostly excites the C6 monomers. Table 1 summarizes the results
obtained by fitting the raw data acquired from the different emitting
species. In each case, the data took a two-component exponential decay
fit. For blank C6 in water, the slower component (τ2) indicates emission lifetime of the locally excited C6 molecule
and the faster one (τ1) shows that of the aggregate.32,35 On addition of β-CD, we obtained a fast growth component
(τ1) (signified by the negative percentage contribution)
indicating the time scale of residence of the excited species for
ICT for the β-CD-encapsulated C6 due to 1:2 guest–host
binding.32,35 On progressive addition of GO (4–14
μg/mL as per Table 1), we noticed subsequent lowering of the growth component
which, probably, shows that the reduction in ICT might be because
of the ground-state electron transfer process as the C6-β-CD
nanostructures get adsorbed over the GO nanosheets (as schematically
modeled in Scheme 1 later). On further increasing the GO concentration, an extremely
fast decay component shares the major contribution (shown in italics
in Table 1). Because
a 405 nm diode laser was used to excite the samples and as its temporal
resolution is <200 ps, we do not claim the authenticity of the
magnitudes of the ultrafast times which are shown in italics in Table 1. However, the information
on the ultrafast decay is sufficient to analyze the results (Figure 5). The ultrafast
decay components can well be argued to appear because of the dynamic
collisions between the C6-β-CD@GO composites as observed in
the steady-state quenching studies before. Using an appropriate filter
to eliminate the scattering signals (if any) at higher GO concentration
leads us to this conclusion.

Mechanistic Details
Generally, absorption of light
by a species reduces on decrease in their free existence. Hence,
it is understandable that the amount of free C6-β-CD nanostructures
was reduced in the presence of GO. The results indicate a possible
interaction of the C6-β-CD nanostructures with the added GO.
To investigate the nature of interaction between the two species,
their individual structural characteristics could be excavated. C6
has stacking propensity through π–π interaction
as observed before from their tendency to form microcrystals. The N,N′-dialkyl substituted coumarin derivatives favor
ICT due to their planar forms that develop partially charged separated
ground-state species. This increases the possibility of development
of parallel stacks through van der Waals44 as well as electrostatic interactions. However, in the present case,
the presence of β-CD in solution imposes disintegration of the
C6 microcrystals and encapsulation of the fluorophores inside the
β-CD cavity. The process produces planar and square nanostructures
as mentioned before and hence revives the ICT to regain the fluorescence
emission.32 On the other hand, the GO sheet
consists mostly of hexagonal ring-based carbon system bearing sp2 carbon atoms and also (partly) sp3 carbons bearing
the oxygen-containing functional groups.23 This structural peculiarity enables GO to accept electrons from
the dedicated donors. The C6-β-CD nanostructures get adsorbed
on the GO sheets and as a result generate a probable channel for electron
donation from C6 to GO. This may reduce the ICT at the expense of
intermolecular electron transfer in the ground state which could be
the responsible factor for the static quenching of the fluorophore. Scheme 1 provides a diagrammatic
representation of the hypothesis. Quenching of C6-β-CD fluorescence
in the presence of GO is clearly visualized in epifluorescence microscopy
images (Figure 6).

Concentrations of C6, β-CD, and GO are 1 μM, 7 mM, and
8 μg/mL, respectively.

Cyclic Voltammetry To Prove the Electron Transfer Process
The above description on the static and dynamic quenching of the
nanocomposites is evident from the spectroscopic findings. However,
the ground-state electron transfer process needs to be proven experimentally.
The ICT in C6 molecules trapped in β-CD is suppressed due to
adsorption of the C6-β-CD nanocomposites on the GO nanosheets
as hypothesized due to intermolecular electron transfer from C6 to
GO which is a good electron acceptor as well as conductor.16,17,21,28 The process demands two-electron transfer because there is a lone
pair of electrons over the N-atom in the N,N-diethylamine group in C6. To prove this, we performed
cyclic voltammetry (CV) with C6 under the various conditions as described
in the text. The voltammograms obtained are provided in Figure 7.

Figure 7 Cyclic voltammograms
for C6, C6-β-CD, C6-β-CD@GO, C6-GO,
and GO in an aqueous medium at a 100 mV/s scan rate at room temperature.
The plots follow the IUPAC convention.

The CV experiment was performed at three different scan rates,
viz., 50, 75, and 100 mV/s. The plot of the anodic peak current versus
the square root of the scan rate is linear (Figure 8). Moreover, the peak voltage remained fixed
at 0.72 V for all the three different scan rates. Thus, the overall
electron transfer process is diffusion controlled and reversible in
nature. The two oxidation peaks are due to the two-electron transfer
phenomenon. The electrochemical reversibility describes the rate of
electron transfer. The signals indicate that the electron transfer
becomes much easier when C6 is encapsulated in the β-CDs and
adsorbed on the surface of the GO nanosheets. It was observed that
the first oxidation peak arises at a lower potential for C6-β-CD@GO
(57 mV) compared to C6-β-CD (123 mV). Hence, oxidation (loss
of electron of C6 to GO) becomes easier in the presence of the GO
nanosheets in an aqueous medium. The experimental evidence clearly
states that the electron over the N-atom of the N,N-diethylamine group in C6 that was participating in ICT when encapsulated
in the β-CDs later moves to GO through an intermolecular electron
transfer. The process was not prominent between the C6 microcrystals
and the GO nanosheets, but pronounced as β-CDs disintegrated
the nanocrystals and encapsulated the C6 molecules.

vs square root of the scan rate to
check the reversibility of the process.

Conclusions
A unique process of disintegration of self-assembled
C6 molecules
by β-CDs, thus, reviving the lost fluorescence of a laser dye
followed by physical adsorption on GO nanosheets and inducing ground-state
electron transfer from the C6-β-CD composite to GO, has been
experimentally illustrated. On excitation, the C6-β-CD composite
initially transfers energy to the attached GO surface and subsequently
when the GO surface gets saturated with the adsorbed C6, the emitting
composites collide with excess GO and results into dynamic quenching
of energy. Electrochemistry confirms the ground-state two-electron
transfer process. The results show that the ground-state electron
transfer and excited state energy transfer from the C6-β-CD
composite can be controlled by adding GO which is a good electron
acceptor. The findings have the potential toward fabrication of energy-harvesting
antenna for further applications.

Experimental Section
Materials
C6, β-CD (purity > 97%), and 4–10%
edge-oxidized GO (EOGO or GO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and
used as received. HPLC grade water was used throughout the experiment.
A 50 μL of stock solution (50 μM) of C6 in methanol was
added to water to get its final concentration as 1 μM. β-CD
(0.0199 g) was added to the experimental solution to get the final
concentration as 7 mM. This concentration of β-CD was used following
our previous observations to ensure encapsulation of most of the C6
molecules.32 A stock solution of GO (1
mg/mL) was prepared in water by sonication and added to the experimental
solution in steps for the various studies.

Methods
The absorption
and fluorescence spectra were
collected by using a Hitachi U-2900 spectrophotometer and a PTI QM-40
spectrofluorimeter. The fluorescence lifetimes were measured using
a time-correlated single photon counting method in a spectrofluorimeter
from Horiba Jobin Yvon IBH equipped with a FC-MCP-50SC MCP-PMT detection
unit. The excitation pulse used was 405 nm (temporal resolution <
200 ps). The raw data were fitted using DAC software supplied with
the machine. The epifluorescence images were taken using an LSM 710
with a microscope Axio-Observer Z.1 from Carl Zeiss. The CV experiments
were done using Newport Oriel Instruments, U.S.A.-69907. The electrochemical
measurements were carried out in acidulated water as the electrolyte,
Pt as the working electrode, Ag/Ag+ as the reference electrode,
and Pt wire as the counter electrode with samples (i) C6 (1 μM),
(ii) C6-7 mM β-CD, (iii) C6-7 mM β-CD-28 μg/mL of
GO, and (iv) C6-28 μg/mL of GO. A total of 7.5 mL of solution
was placed in a three-necked vessel and the data were plotted at three
different scan rates: 50, 75, and 100 mV/s. The anodic peak current
against the square root of the scan rate was plotted to ensure the
reversible electron transfer process in C6.
