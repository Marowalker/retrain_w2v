Flavonoids
are plant secondary metabolites with great potential
in the food industry. Metabolic engineering of Saccharomyces
cerevisiae is a sustainable production technique.
However, the current naringenin production yield is low because of
inefficient enzymatic activity. Hence, this study uses gene source
screening as a tool to identify the best gene source for enzymes such
as 4-coumarate: coenzyme ligase (4CL) and chalcone synthase (CHS).
For the first time, the 4CL gene from Medicago truncatula and the CHS gene from Vitis vinifera were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and
this combination provided the highest yield of naringenin, which was
28-fold higher as compared to the reference strain. The combinations
obtained similar performance in the Y-28 strains, where the highest
production was 28.68 mg/L. Our results demonstrated that the selection
and combination of enzymes from the correct gene source could greatly
improve naringenin production. For the future, this could help commercialize
flavonoid production, which would result in natural food preservatives
and additives.

Introduction
Flavonoids are natural
compounds with highly advantageous health
benefits. Their antioxidant, antiallergenic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory
properties have been shown to help prevent the development of neurodegenerative
and cardiovascular diseases, Parkinson’s disease, obesity,
diabetes, and aging.1−3 Flavonoids can be found in plants, especially in
berries. Consumption of flavonoid-rich foods has been related to improved
health. Because of this, flavonoids have the potential as food additives,
and they can be used in food or beverages to increase their nutritional
value and create a value-added product.4 Furthermore, flavonoids possess highly active antimicrobial properties,
which present the opportunity to apply flavonoids as food preservatives.
As increasing disadvantages of using synthetic compounds in the food
industry are emerging, the use of natural food preservatives and additives
is a better solution.5

Even though
there is a significant potential for the use of flavonoids
in the food industry, the current production, which is mainly based
on plant extraction, has many limitations. First, many of these plants
are also food sources. Hence, their usage for flavonoid extraction
means a decrease in the overall food availability. Second, the amount
of available plants is restricted by small plantation sizes, unfavorable
climate, long growing time, and cycles. At the same time, the concentration
of flavonoids is relatively low in these plants. All these limitations
add up to an expensive, high energy demanding preparation process,
which leaves place for further improvements.6

An alternative solution is chemical synthesis, but because
of the
fact that certain flavonoid structures are complex, synthesis is expensive
and time and energy demanding.7 Recently,
more sustainable options have been investigated, such as the potential
use of food waste. The possibility to extract antioxidants from food
wastes, residues from fruit and vegetable processing, for use as food
additives had been investigated.8 However,
the extraction process is not optimal, which is very laborious, and
the obtained amount of flavonoids is relatively low.

A potential
alternative for sustainable production of flavonoids
is the application of metabolic engineering on food-grade microorganisms,
such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Metabolic
engineering alters the function of the microorganism by the insertion
of non-native DNA sequences, which produces enzymes that are capable
of producing the target compound. This newly established enzymatic
system mimics the flavonoid producing pathway in plants and reproduces
it, utilizing the already existing precursors in the host microorganism.9 This method saves time, labor, and energy and
does not compete with food source. Thus, it could provide a better
and more cost-effective alternative sustainable method for the production
of flavonoids.

Naringenin is the central precursor of the flavonoid
pathway. It
is produced through the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. As it is
a central compound in this pathway, it is essential for the production
of other flavonoids such as isoflavonoids, flavonols, dihydroflavonols,
and anthocyanidins.10 The pathway for naringenin
production (Figure 1) consists of five enzymes, which are phenylalanine ammonia lyase
(PAL), cinnamate 4-hydroxylase (C4H), 4-coumarate: coenzyme (CoA)
ligase (4CL), chalcone synthase (CHS), and chalcone isomerase (CHI).
Alternatively, tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is able to convert tyrosine
to p-coumaric acid (Figure 1). In this way, the pathway can bypass C4H.
Additionally, naringenin chalcone is able to convert to naringenin
without CHI under certain conditions. This opens up the possibility
to bypass CHI and shorten the necessary changes in the host microorganism.11

Figure 1 Biosynthetic pathway of naringenin.

Naringenin was first produced with the aid of metabolic engineering
tools in Escherichia coli by Hwang
et al.12 Then, a fine pathway was introduced
into S. cerevisiae by Jiang et al.13 In order to boost the naringenin production, p-coumaric acid-overexpressing strains were applied, and
gene overexpression, deletion, and replacement were performed.6,14−16 Further engineering steps made it possible to use
glucose as the feedstock, which resulted in the yield of 108 mg/L
naringenin.17,18 However, the current enzymatic
activity was generally low, which leaves room for further improvements.
While the genetic changes were well-explored, the enzyme sources were
unexplored, even though it is known that the origin of the enzyme
greatly influences its enzymatic activities and could affect the production
rate. Hence, gene screening should be carried out. This research focused
on identifying the source of the 4CL and CHS enzymes, which lead to
the highest naringenin production.

Results and Discussion
Gene Source
Selection
4CL and CHS gene sequences were
screened in the NCBI database based on their origin, which was compared
by their evolutionary background, gene sequences, and protein tertiary
structures. On the basis of the results, four 4CL and four CHS gene
sources were selected and expressed in S. cerevisiae. The 4CL gene sources were Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula, Petroselinum crispum, and Streptomyces
coelicolor. The CHS gene sources were A. thaliana, Glycyrrhiza uralensis, Hypericum androsaemum, and Vitis vinifera. A. thaliana is a suitable reference as it is the most frequently used gene source
for the expression of 4CL and CHS genes by research groups. Most of
the other enzymes have been expressed before, but this is the first
time that 4CL from M. truncatula and
CHS from V. vinifera are used for naringenin
production. Additionally, many unique combinations have been expressed
for the first time.

On the basis of the gene sequence blast
results (Tables 1 and 2), the 4CL sources were very diverse. It was found
that S. coelicolor showed the least
similarities, as compared with the other gene sequences. This was
reasonable as S. coelicolor is a bacterium,
while the others are plants. For CHS, there was less diversity. The
gene sequence from G. uralensis was
more distinguished, with a slightly less similarity percentage.

The
percentage identity of the protein tertiary structures was
shown to be similarly aligned with the gene sequence results (Tables 3 and 4). The 4CL structures were more diverse compared to the CHS
structures. In particular, the results from S. coelicolor were shown to be the most noticeably different. However, the tertiary
structure of M. truncatula 4CL was
unlike the others, as the percentage identity was only around 50%,
which was lower than the DNA sequence similarity value. An aligned
tertiary structure comparison is shown in Figure 2a.

A phylogenetic tree, which displayed the evolutionary
relationship
between the enzymes, was created for 4CL and CHS. As shown in Figure 2b, the 4CL gene from A. thaliana and P. crispum was more similar as they were closer, whereas M.
truncatula and S. coelicolor were at two branches on different ends of the tree. Similarly, the
CHS gene from A. thaliana and H. androsaemum was found in the middle of the branch,
while G. uralensis and V. viniferawere found toward two different ends.
These findings were found to be in alignment with the DNA sequence
and protein structure similarities.

Expression of New Combinations
in S. cerevisiae
The pCEV-G1-Km
plasmids containing the different 4CL–CHS
combinations were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and the naringenin production was quantified by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Table 5 and Figure 3). The highest yield was reached by expressing 4CL from M. truncatula and CHS from V. vinifera. This is a novel combination as neither of these enzymes has been
expressed in S. cerevisae. Their naringenin
production was 28-fold higher as compared to the reference strain
which expressed the 4CL and CHS genes from A. thaliana.

pCEV-G1-Km-at4CL-guCHS	2.7	3.15	
pCEV-G1-Km-at4CL-atCHS	0.26	7.65	
Interestingly, even when paired up with different
enzyme sources,
the 4CL gene from M. truncatula provided
the highest naringenin production rate. In comparison, the CHS gene
from V. vinifera was inferior as compared
to the other CHS sources (Figure 3). A Western blot analysis confirmed that the 4CL gene
from P. crispum and S. coelicolor could not be expressed in the S. cerevisiae BY4741 strain. It was also discovered
that the 4CL gene from M. truncatula was not compatible with the CHS gene from A. thaliana and H. androsaemum.

Metabolite
Profiling
In order to understand the key
mechanisms for naringenin production and how this mechanism influenced
cell behavior, metabolite profiling was performed using gas chromatography–mass
spectrometry (GC–MS). Three key metabolites were found, such
as l-aspartate, glycine, and serine. These three metabolites
were shown to be present in very different amounts in the naringenin
producing and nonproducing strains (Table 6). In the naringenin producing strain, the
amount of l-aspartate and serine was found to be only half,
while the glycine amount was almost doubled.

naringenin nonproducing strains	2 757 179	5 007 451	2 417 988	
The decrease in the l-aspartate amount indicated that
more oxaloacetic acid was produced, which then enhanced gluconeogenesis.19,20 Through the fatty acid synthesis pathway, it could lead to higher
malonyl-CoA amount,21 which could then
have been consumed by the CHS enzyme during naringenin production.
Similarly, the decrease in the serine amount might be due to higher
conversion toward malonyl-CoA, which has been consumed by pyruvate,
acetyl-CoA, and fatty acid synthesis.22 On the other hand, the increased glycine amount showed that it was
not converted into serine, even though the amount of serine was depleted.23 This indicated that the amino acid catabolic
pathway was inhibited (Figure 4). However, more research is required to further understand
the connection between these pathways and the naringenin producing
pathway.

Figure 4 Metabolic changes induced by naringenin production in S. cerevisiae. The speculative enhanced pathway by
naringenin producing strains (shown by orange arrows) mapped onto
metabolic pathways (shown by gray arrows). Blue and red boxes demonstrate
the decrease and increase of the targeted amino acid amount.

Combination Expression
in the Y-28 S. cerevisiae Strain
In order to increase the naringenin production yield,
six pCEV-G1-Km plasmids were expressed in a genetically engineered S. cerevisiae Y-28 strain, along with the pCEV-G1-Ph-fjTAL-msCHI
plasmid. The Y-28 strain was engineered to use a modified GAL system,
which helped in gene overexpression. Gene IDH1 was silenced for the
overexpression of ACL from Yarrowia lipolytica and native ACS1 to increase the malonyl-CoA supply. Additionally,
the tyrosine supply was also increased with the downregulation of
PHA2 and deletion of PDC5 and ARO10.6 The
six combinations expressed in the Y-28 strain used glucose as the
carbon source, and the naringenin production was then analyzed by
HPLC (Table 7).

the S. cerevisiae Y-28 Strain and Its
Effect on Naringenin Production When Grown on Glucose as the Carbon

pCEV-G1-Km-at4CL-atCHS	19.15	
The results showed a similar
pattern as compared to the wild-type
BY4741 strain, as the expected increased yield was reached (Figure 5). The lowest naringenin
production was achieved by the 4CL and CHS genes from A. thaliana. However, the production value significantly
increased from 0.26 mg/L in BY4741 to 19.15 mg/L in Y-28. The highest
production was 24 mg/L of naringenin, which was three times higher
than the highest production in the BY4741 strain. This was reached
by two strains expressing the 4CL gene from M. truncatula and the CHS gene from V. vinifera and G. uralensis.

Figure 5 Comparison of naringenin
production in BY4741, Y-28 utilizing glucose,
and Y-28 utilizing sucrose and glycerol as the carbon source.

Sucrose and Glycerol as
a Carbon Source
It was previously
shown that the use of 1% sucrose and 1% glycerol as the carbon source
instead of 2% glucose could increase the naringenin yield in the Y-28
strains.6 In order to investigate if the
different carbon sources had an effect on the amount of naringenin
produced, the six plasmids, which were expressed in the Y-28 strains,
were also grown on sucrose and glycerol solution as a carbon source
(Table 8). A general
increase had been detected in the naringenin yields when sucrose and
glycerol were used as the carbon source. It was due to the different
breakdown processes of glucose, sucrose, and glycerol. Glycerol converts
to glycerol 3-phosphate and then to dihydroxyacetone phosphate by
glycerol kinase and glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which allows
easy access to the carbon source.24 On
the other hand, sucrose takes a longer time to break down into glucose
through the conversion to sucrose-6-phosphate and then to glucose-6-phosphate
and fructose by a sucrose hydrolyzing enzyme. Furthermore, fructose
can be converted to glucose-6-phosphate by glucose-6-phosphate isomerase.25 When the cultures were grown on glucose, the
carbon source would be immediately consumed at the initial growth
stage. However, the use of glycerol and sucrose would provide carbon
source both at the initial stage by glycerol breakdown and in later
stages by sucrose breakdown.

pCEV-G1-Km-at4CL-guCHS	19.42

The results displayed a similar
pattern as before, where the use
of the 4CL gene from M. truncatula resulted
in the highest naringenin production (Figure 5). However, it was surprising to note that
the strain expressing the pCEV-G1-Km-at4CL-haCHS recombinant plasmid
had the same naringenin production as the strain expressing the 4CL
gene from M. truncatula. In this study,
the highest obtained naringenin yield from a Y-28 strain was 28.68
mg/L, which was lower as compared to the 90 mg/L naringenin production
obtained by Lyu et al.6 After looking into
the utilized plasmids, it was clear that pCEV-G1-Km was a less satisfying
choice for naringenin production compared to the pks plasmid. The
main reason for this might be that the antibiotic used for pCEV-G1-Km
was G418. G418 had a negative effect on the growth rate of S. cerevisiae.26 As the
growth rate decreased, less naringenin was produced, which might explain
that the lower yields are obtained. The results had clearly demonstrated
that gene source selection has a high impact on naringenin production.
However, as the naringenin production increased, the gene source selection
was shown to have less impact on the final amount of naringenin.

In summary, several 4CL and CHS gene source combinations were analyzed
and expressed in S. cerevisiae BY4741
and Y-28 strains. For the first time, the 4CL gene from M. truncatula and the CHS gene from V. vinifera were expressed in S. cerevisiae, and their combination resulted in the highest naringenin yield.
The production was 28-fold higher as compared to that of the reference
BY4741 strain expressing the 4CL gene and CHS gene from A. thaliana. In addition, the similarity pattern
of the combination of production yields between the BY4741 and Y-28
strains was matching. These results had shown that gene source selection
indeed had an effect on naringenin production in S.
cerevisiae. With regard to the cellular mechanism
behind naringenin production, metabolic profiling concluded that l-aspartate, glycine, and serine amounts were significantly
altered. These three metabolites are related to the consumption of
malonyl-CoA. However, further studies are needed to unravel the exact
mechanism of these metabolites on naringenin production.

Overall,
gene screening was shown to be a necessary tool for optimal
flavonoid production. The correct selection and combination of gene
sources could improve enzyme efficiency, leading to more efficient
and sustainable production platform for flavonoid production. This
could help increase the possibility to commercialize flavonoid production
for future works. The flavonoids produced could also be used as a
natural, healthier food preservative and could be incorporated into
food and beverages products to add value.

Experimental Section
Culture
Media and Microbial Growth Conditions
E. coli cell cultures were grown in Luria-Bertani
(LB) broth at 37 °C and supplemented with 100 μg/mL of
ampicillin for recombinants harboring pUC57 and pCEV-G1-Km-derived
plasmids. Yeast was cultured in YPD (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract,
and 2% glucose) or YPSg (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 1% sucrose–1%
glycerol) media supplemented with either 200 μg/mL of geneticin
(G418) or additional 40 μg/mL of phleomycin antibiotics at 30
°C. The chemicals and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma (Sigma-Aldrich,
USA).

Microbial Strains, Plasmid, and Genes
E. coli Top 10 (Novagen, USA) was chosen as the strain
for gene manipulation, while S. cerevisiae BY474127 and Y-286 were used for pathway engineering. The plasmid used for the experiment
is pCEV-G1-Km,26 where 4CL and CHS were
cloned and expressed. While the Y-28 strains contained the pCEV-G1-Ph
plasmid expressing TAL from Flavobacterium johnsoniae and CHI from Medicago sativa, which
were given by Lyu et al.28

All 4CL
and CHS genes used in this study were synthesized by GenScipt, with
codon optimization according to S. cerevisiae and cloned in pUC57. The DNA sequences were obtained from the NCBI
GenBank with the following reference numbers for 4CL: A. thaliana (NM_113019.3), M. truncatula (XM_003610795.2), P. crispum (KF765780.1), and S. coelicolor (NC_003888.3) and for CHS: A. thaliana (NM_121396.3), G. uralensis (EF026979.1), H. androsaemum (AF315345.1), and V. vinifera (NM_001280950.1).

Phylogenetic Tree and Protein Tertiary Structure Construction
The gene sequences used for the phylogenetic tree and protein tertiary
structure were obtained from NCBI Nucleotide database based on the
accession code taken from the published literature. The tree was prepared
in MEGA729 using the maximum likelihood
statistical method and Tamura–Nei model on MUSCLE aligned sequences.30 The tertiary structures were designed with Phyre2,31 visualized, aligned, and analyzed in Chimera.32

Construction of Plasmids, Yeast Transformation,
and Cultivation
During the construction of pCEV-G1-Km-4CL-CHS
recombinant plasmids,
each 4CL was digested from the pUC57 plasmid using NotI and SpeI.
The pCEV-G1-Km plasmid was opened up with the same restriction enzymes.
4CL genes were ligated to the open section of the plasmid using the
TEF1 promoter, followed by the NotI restriction site. This section
also involves an AHD1 terminator, followed by the SpeI restriction
site. The ligation results were checked by gel electrophoresis, which
confirmed that all the 4CL genes were successfully placed into the
plasmid. All four pCEV-G1-Km-4CL recombinant plasmids were further
digested with BamHI and SacII. The CHS genes were digested from pUC57
plasmids using the same restriction enzymes. CHS genes were ligated
to the open section of the pCEV-G1-Km-4CL recombinant plasmids. This
section uses the PGK1 promoter, followed by the BamHI restriction
site. This section also involves a CYC1 terminator, followed by the
SacII restriction site. The ligation results were checked by gel electrophoresis,
which confirmed that all 16 new recombinant plasmids containing 4CL
and CHS genes were successfully generated.

The constructed plasmids
were transformed into BY4741 or Y-28 using the lithium acetate/single-stranded
carrier DNA/polyethylene glycol method33 in order to generate the recombinant strains for naringenin production.
The positive strains for BY4741 were screened on YPD plates supplemented
with 200 μg/mL of geneticin, while for Y-28 it was either YPD
or YPSg plates supplemented with 200 μg/mL of geneticin and
40 μg/mL of phleomycin. Single colony, which contained pCEV-G1-Km-4CL-CHS,
was inoculated in 5 mL of YPD/YPSg with either only geneticin or geneticin
and phleomycin and shaken at 200 rpm for 20 h at 30 °C. Then
2% of the overnight culture was inoculated into 50 mL of fresh YPD/YPSg
media supplemented with antibiotics and incubated for 72 h. For the
BY4741 strains, at 12 h of fermentation, 10 mg of p-coumaric acid was added to the culture as a precursor.

Western Blot
Cell extracts were extracted in Y-PER
Yeast Protein Extraction Reagent (ThermoFisher) with the addition
of an ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-free protease inhibitor (Roche).
Cell lysates (25 μL) were resolved using a 15% SDS-PAGE gel.
The resolved proteins were electro-transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Bio-Rad), which were then probed with HRP-conjugated anti-6×
His tag antibody (Rabbit polyclonal) (abcam) in 1:4000 dilution. The
results were visualized using a Pierce 1-step ultra TMB blotting solution
(ThermoFisher).

Naringenin Extraction Method
BY4741
(10 mL) or 1 mL
of Y-28 culture at the end of the fermentation was centrifuged at
10 000 rpm for 1 min, and then the supernatant was taken for
extracellular naringenin analysis. To the supernatant, 1:1 ethyl acetate
was added, which was mixed by vortexing for 30 s and rotating for
2 h at room temperature. The sample was centrifuged at 10 000
rpm for 10 min, after which the upper layer was separated and collected.
After all liquid has evaporated, 500 μL of ethyl acetate was
added, and the sample was filtered before HPLC analysis.

HPLC Analysis
Naringenin was analyzed by the HPLC system
(Agilent 1100) equipped with a variable wavelength detector and a
C18 column (4.6 mm × 150 mm, RESTEK). The process was performed
with a gradient method involving two solvents: methanol and water.
The process included several steps: 25% of methanol was used as a
solvent, the concentration increased to 75% in 10 min, and then in
the following 20 min, the concentration reached 100%, and it was held
there for 10 min. Finally, the methanol content returned to 25% in
2 min, which was held there for 13 min. Each sample was run in triplicates.
The analysis was performed with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, and the
signal was detected at 280 nm.

Intracellular Metabolite
Extraction for GC–MS
From the cultivated samples,
pellets equalling 10 of OD600 were collected as the cultures
were centrifuged at 12 000
rpm for 2 min. The pellets were washed three times with water, to
which 0.5 mL of water, 0.5 mL of methanol, and 10 μL of 2 mg/mL
ribitol dissolved in water were added along with glass beads. The
pellet cells were broken and centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for
2 min. The supernatant was collected, and methanol was evaporated
at 37 °C overnight. The samples were completely dried in a freeze
drier after 12 h.

Fifty microliters of 20 mg/mL methoxyamine
hydrochloride dissolved in pyridine was added to the dried samples
and incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide (100 μL) with
1% trimethylchlorosilane was added for silylation, and the samples
were kept at 70 °C for 30 min. Before GC–MS measurements,
the samples were centrifuged at 14 000 rpm for 20 min, and
the upper layer was collected for analysis.34

GC–MS Analysis
Metabolite profiling was performed
by using the GC–MS system (Agilent Technologies 7890A-5975C)
equipped with an HP-5MS, 5% phenyl-methyl-silox capillary column (30
m × 250 μm × 0.25 μm; Agilent J&W Scientific,
Folsom, CA, USA) using a Triple-Axis HED-EM detector. The sample (1
μL) was injected by splitless mode. Each sample was run in triplicates.
The carrier gas used was helium, with a constant flow rate of 1.1
mL/min. The inlet temperature was set to 250 °C, while the ion
source temperature was 230 °C. The oven temperature was set to
start at 75 °C for 4 min, and with an increase in 4 °C/min,
it reached 280 °C at the end of the run, where it was kept for
2 min. The obtained compounds were analyzed using Agilent MSD Chemstation
Data Analysis and identified with the NIST08 mass spectral library.
The selected compound autointegrated peaks had been aligned and compared
based on their abundance.
