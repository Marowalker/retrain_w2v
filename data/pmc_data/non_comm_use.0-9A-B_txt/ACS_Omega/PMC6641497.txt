The mechanistic pathways
of metal-catalyzed pentannulation and
hexannulation of aromatic enediyne were studied quantum mechanically
with Pt and Au salts. In agreement with the experimental facts, our
result shows that the pentannulation favors over the hexannulation
under Pt-catalyzed conditions and the reverse possibility favors when
the Pt salt is replaced with an Au one. The Pt-catalyzed reaction
involves a long-range acyl migration that follows the cyclization
step. Our study reveals that such migration takes place under the
assistance of a ligand of the metal atom. Moreover, the variation
of aromaticity (probed by the change of the nucleus-independent chemical
shift (0) value) in the cyclization steps shows that both processes
maintain the development of the aromatic character of the generated
intermediate during the progress of the reaction.

Introduction
Propargylic esters
serve as an important starting material in the
chemistry of platinum- and gold-catalyzed reactions because they are
easily available in the form of densely functionalized derivatives
and offer a general route of [1,2]- or [1,3]-ester migration to form
metal carbenoids or metal-coordinated allene intermediates. The rearranged
intermediates may further undergo some interesting reactions depending
upon the reactive moiety present in the environment.1 A tandem sequence of rearrangement reactions to produce
useful carbon skeletal motifs is found in a large number of recent
contributions. The selectivity of initial [1,2]- or [1,3]-migration
of ester depends on the substituent present in the reactant and the
further evolution of the intermediate thus generated.2 One class of the reaction pattern is the intramolecular
nucleophilic attack by an atom such as carbon,3 oxygen,4 or nitrogen.5 Among them, a notable example has been reported by Zhao
et al.,6 where benzannulated products are
produced from diynol esters by following the sequence of the [3,3]
sigmatropic rearrangement/cycloisomerization reaction under Au- or
Ag-catalyzed conditions (Scheme 1). The cyclization may be considered as a transition
metal-catalyzed version of Myers–Saito cyclization7 for the synthesis of fused aromatic ketones.
In this sequence, the generated intermediate enyne–allene undergoes
a 6-endo-dig cyclization through the metal-promoted activation of
an alkyne moiety (Scheme 1). Though the behavior of the Pt metal has been found to be
similar to that of the Au metal in catalyzing several cycloisomerization
reactions,8 a recent report of Chen et
al.9 shows that the alteration of the catalytic
condition by replacing Au or Ag salt with Pt one follows a different
pathway. Similar substrates undergo an unexpected 5-exo-dig cyclization
under PtCl2-catalyzed conditions and furnish a pentannulated
benzofulvene derivative (Scheme 1). Moreover, the reaction follows an unusual long-range
migration of the acyl group to generate a methylene-benzofulvenediketone.
While rationalizing the mechanistic steps, the authors assumed an
initial Pt-catalyzed [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement of a propargylic
ester to a reactive carboxyallene species that finally undergoes 5-exo-dig
cyclization to generate the pentannulated compound. The final [1,5]-acyl
migration furnishes a single stereoisomeric Z-configured
end product.

Scheme 1 Divergent Products Generated in Two Different Metal-Catalyzed
Conditions
The variation in reaction
pathways under two different catalytic
conditions caught our attention and promoted us to make a detailed
theoretical investigation on the mechanism for locating the guiding
factors that stimulate the formation of different products under two
environments.

A previous report on dynamics study on uncatalyzed
versions of
enyne–allene cyclization shows that the reaction may be interpreted
in terms of formation of a highly asynchronous transition state near
the concerted/stepwise boundary.10 However,
the catalytic process should follow a different pathway and necessitates
the reinvestigation of the possible mechanisms under the presence
of metal salts that catalyze the reaction. In addition, our previous
report on Au-catalyzed acyl migration shows an unusual result, where
the migrating group was found to take the assistance of a ligand of
the Au complex to generate the final product.11 Observing the unusual long-range acyl migration in the present problem
of Pt-catalyzed cyclization, we suspected a similar type of ligand-assisted
mechanism for such rearrangement reactions that take place through
a multistep process. Searching and analyzing several possibilities
reveal that such migration occurs through the assistance of ligands
to follow an energetically favorable pathway which was not evident
before this investigation. Moreover, the paradox of favoring a nonaromatic-fused
benzofulvene derivative rather than a stable aromatic naphthyl ring
structure under Pt-catalyzed conditions has also been addressed by
the study of the developing aromaticity of the whole structure during
the cyclization process. Analysis of the molecular orbitals also interprets
the requirement of a relatively high activation barrier for platinum-catalyzed
cyclization steps, which is consistent with the experimental condition
required for two different metal-catalyzing environments. The Results and Discussion section has been organized
according to the following sequence: (1) computation and analysis
of the possible pathways in the Pt-catalyzed enediyne rearrangement
to the pentannulated benzofulvene derivative. (2) Comparative study
of the Pt-catalyzed pentannulation to that of hexannulation. (3) Computation
and comparative study on the Au-catalyzed pentannulation and hexannulation
of the enediyne. (4) Analysis of the divergent pathway of Pt- and
Au-catalyzed annulation on the basis of electronic distribution of
key stationary points on the favorable pathways.

Results and Discussion
For the study on all the metal-catalyzed cyclizations, we have
chosen the benzenediyne ester (1 in Scheme 2 and R1 = R2 = R = CH3 in Scheme 1) as a model structure in which the metal
center binds the triple bonds of the two substituents on the benzene
nucleus.

Computation and Analysis of Pt-Catalyzed Pentannulation Pathways
As discussed in the introduction, our exploration starts by designing
the most probable pathways through which the reaction under metal-catalyzed
conditions is taking place.

A short schematic presentation of
the studied pathways is shown in Scheme 2. Each pathway starts from a PtCl2-bound substrate structure (1), in which the metal ion
exists in a square planar geometry by forming a chelate complex with
the two triple bonds of the substrate. The first step involves a [3,3]
sigmatropic shift to produce a metal-bound allene intermediate (2). In pathway-1, the allene intermediate undergoes a 5-exo
dig attack by the triple bond to achieve pentannulation, thus forming
the basic benzofulvene skeleton (3). This intermediate
finally converges to the Pt-bound alkyne system (P) through
a direct acyl migration from the acetate oxygen to its ultimate destination
(indicated by the blue arrow in pathway-1). This pathway shows maximum
resemblance to the proposed pathway,9 where
the final migration involves an [1,5] shift of the acyl group. Pathway-2
also shows a sequence similar to that of pathway-1 during the formation
of the benzofulvene derivative (3), that is, allene formation
followed by cyclization. However, this pathway deviates from pathway-1
when the acyl migration takes place with the assistance of several
atoms in a step wise fashion. During the acyl transfer, the migrating
acyl group first jumps to the chlorine ligand (shown by the blue arrow
in pathway-2) and then reaches to the carbon atom adjacent to the
final destination (shown by green arrow). The last migration step
(shown by red arrow) results in the final product P.
Pathway-3 differs from pathway-1 and 2 in the sequence of cyclization
and acyl migration steps. Here, the allene derivative undergoes an
acyl migration process (2 to 4) (may be
characterized as a [1,9] shift of the acyl group), followed by the
final cyclization step to generate the product (P). Shifting
of the acyl group from oxygen to the alkyne carbon occurs through
two steps (shown by blue and green arrows on pathway-3) in which the
intermediate shows a bond between the migrating acyl group and the
metal atom.

Detailed potential energy surfaces of the studied
pathways are
shown in Figure 1 (for
clarity, the geometry of the stationary points associated with pathway-2
only are shown in this diagram as this pathway was found to be energetically
the most favorable one. Geometries of pathway-1 and 3 are shown in
the Supporting Information). In all three
pathways, the initial two steps represent the allene formation consisting
of two transition structures (1-TS1 and 1-TS2) and an intermediate
(1-I2) between them (Figure 1). In the first step, the metal-bound substrate 1-I1 transforms
into a six-membered cyclic intermediate 1-I2 (through 1-TS1) by the
nucleophilic attack of the acetoxy oxygen on the distal terminus of
the triple bond. This step is followed by the ring-opening process
through 1-TS2, the end product of which is the allene bound metal
complex (1-I3). In pathway-1, the intermediate 1-I3 undergoes a metal-catalyzed
cyclization step through a 5-exo-dig mode (1-TS3) in which the middle
carbon atom of the allenic moiety joins with the acetylenic carbon
atom (connected directly to the aromatic ring) and generates pentannulated
intermediate 1-I4 (structure 3 in Scheme 2). The activation free energy required in
such process is 22.47 kcal mol–1 (Figure 1 and Table 1). This step is followed by a direct acyl
migration (through 1-TS4, magenta color) from the allenyl oxygen to
the newly formed exocyclic double bond (see also the blue arrow in
pathway-1 of Scheme 2) with an activation barrier of 38.61 kcal mol–1. The comparison of the energy requirement, as summarized in Table 1, clearly suggests
that the highest barrier involved in pathway-1 is the acyl migration
process (38.61 kcal mol–1) and acts as the rate-determining
step.

In pathway-2, the allene
intermediate 1-I3 follows a cyclization
step similar to that in pathway-1 to generate intermediate 1-I4. However,
the cyclized intermediate then undergoes a geometrical rearrangement
of the metal-complex structure (blue color path) by rearranging the
ligands with respect to the metal center that places the two chlorine
atoms in the opposite faces of the molecular plane bound to the platinum
ion in between them (see Figure 2, structure 2-I6). Such configurational alteration
of ligands starts from intermediate 1-I4 and passes through 2-TS4,
2-I5, and 2-TS5 successively to give a bipyramidal structure of the
metal complex (2-I6), with one coordination site of the metal atom
remaining vacant.

Figure 2 Structures of the stationary points on pathway-2 showing
the migration
of the acyl group.

The overall change in
the geometry results in the placement of
one chlorine ligand at close proximity with the acetoxy group attached
to the allene moiety. Next step involves a ligand-assisted acyl migration,
where the initial movement of the acyl group takes place from the
allenic oxygen to the proximal chlorine ligand (2-I6 → 2-TS6
→ 2-I7; free energy barrier: 21.98 kcal mol–1) to generate 2-I7 (see the blue colored arrow in pathway-2 of Scheme 2). Our search for
the final movement of the acyl group results in two more transition
structures (2-TS7 and 2-TS8) through which the acyl group first jumps
to a carbon atom of the newly formed five-membered ring (2-I8) (see
the green colored arrow in pathway-2 of Scheme 2) followed by a second migration to the exocyclic
carbon to generate the intermediate 2-I9 (see the red arrow in pathway-2
of Scheme 2). Final
product 2-I10 is obtained by a conformational change of 2-I9. The
comparison of activation energy requirements (Table 1) in various steps clearly suggests that
the highest barrier results from the migration of the acyl group from
one carbon of the pentacyclic ring to its final destination (2-I8
to 2-TS8, 30.36 kcal mol–1). The global activation
barrier (30.36 kcal mol–1) as well as the relative
energy of the highest transition structure (1-TS3, 19.28 kcal mol–1) necessarily indicates the favorability of this mechanism
over pathway-1.

Pathway-3 starts from the deviation of pathway-1
when the allene-bound
Pt complex (1-I3) generates an η1 system (3-I4) from
an η2 one (1-I3) by crossing the transition structure
3-TS3. This makes a geometry, where one coordination site of Pt is
occupied by a single allenic carbon atom. This arrangement leads to
a facile movement of the acyl group from the allene oxygen to the
metal center (3-I4 to 3-I5 through 3-TS4). In the first step of the
acyl migration process, the migrating acyl group forms a bond with
the metal atom, generating a square pyramidal geometry of the complex.
The intermediate is then transformed into another one by the final
acyl migration from a metal center to the acetylenic carbon atom.
Finally, a cyclization step results in the formation of a pentannulated
ring system as the end product. The overall activation barrier shows
a high energy requirement (35.34 kcal mol–1, Table 1) for this process
in comparison to that of pathway-2 and thus considered as an
unfavorable one.

In addition to the activation barrier of the
fragmented steps,
a comparison of global activation energy barriers associated with
three different pathways is also shown in Table 1. It reveals clearly that pathway-2 requires
a minimum energy of activation (30.36 kcal mol–1) and may be considered as a favorable pathway. With this pathway
in hand, we have explored the hypothetical 6-endo-dig cyclization
catalyzed by the Pt salt that would generate the naphthalene derivative.

Comparative Study of Pt-Catalyzed Pentannulation and Hexannulation
Figure 3 represents
the studied energy profile for this hypothetical pathway to generate
the fused naphthyl derivative (violet color). For easy comparison,
the most favorable pathway for pentannulation (pathway-2) is also
shown in blue color.

Figure 3 Energy profile for the comparison of pentannulation and
benzannulation
under Pt-catalyzed conditions.

The pathway for the formation of the naphthyl derivative
originates
from the diversion of pathway-2 at the intermediate 1-I3. Here, this
intermediate undergoes a hypothetical 6-endo-dig attack through 4-TS3
to generate cyclic intermediate 4-I4. The energy of this intermediate
is very close to the precursor transition structure 4-TS3, and the
generated ring is not totally planar in nature. The Pt metal is positioned
below the plane of the newly generated ring. In the next step, the
PtCl2 moiety moves close to one side of the ring, passing
through 4-TS4. The intermediate 4-I5 (generated from 4-TS4) shows
a tricoordinated Pt metal in which one coordination site of the metal
is occupied by just one unsaturated portion of the newly generated
ring. In the next step, the metal atom moves further and comes close
to a single carbon atom of the newly formed ring, maintaining its
orientation on the same plane of the aromatic system (4-I6). Comparison
of the relative free energy (Table 1) reveals that the activation barrier required for
generating the six-membered ring (4-TS3) is 18.79 kcal mol–1 higher than that for generating the five-membered ring (through
1-TS3). To stabilize this intermediate 4-I4, an additional 7.35 kcal
mol–1 energy is needed in the next step (4-I4 →
4-TS4). However, the intermediate 1-I4 in path-2 does not require
this stabilization energy. The necessity of this excess energy in
pathway-4 makes it unfavorable with respect to pathway-2 and thus
does not allow the formation of naphthyl moiety (hexannulation_),
which is consistent with the experimentally observed fact.9

Comparative Study of the Au-Catalyzed Pentannulation
and Hexannulation
After identifying two plausible pathways
for Pt-catalyzed cycloisomerization
for pentannulation and hexannulation, we have explored the Au-catalyzed
cyclization for generating pentannulated and hexannulated rings.

An overview of the studied pathways of Au-catalyzed annulations is
shown in Scheme 3.
As usual, the propargyl moiety undergoes a common rearrangement of
the acetyl group migration to form the metal-bound allene derivative.
Diversion to several pathways occurs from this intermediate. In pathway-5
and 6, the gold ion migrates from the allene to alkyne moiety and
follows pentannulated (green) and hexannulated (red) cyclization to
generate benzofulvene and naphthalene derivatives, respectively. In
another process (violet), the hexannulation was studied without migrating
the metal center from the allene moiety and is designated here as
pathway-7.

Scheme 3 General Scheme for the Study of the Reactions Pathways
The detailed PESs of all these
pathways are shown in Figure 4. The pentannulation process
of pathway-5 starts from the gold-bound diynol–acetate complex
(5-I1) that undergoes an usual [3,3] sigmatropic rearrangement in
two-step processes (through intermediate 5-I2 and transition states
5-TS1 and 5-TS2). To proceed through pathway-5, the generated metal-bound
allene intermediate 5-I3 rearranges to change the coordination site
of Au through two transition states (5-TS3 and 5-TS4). In between
them, the intermediate 5-I4 has an unusual geometry where the Au atom
appears to coordinate with three ligands. The intermediate 5-I5 undergoes
a 5-exo-dig attack to generate the pentannulated product 5-I6 (activation
barrier 22.09 kcal mol–1). The final acyl migration
from the acetate oxygen to the gold-bound unsaturated system results
in the formation of product 5-I7 (activation barrier 17.15 kcal mol–1). Comparison of the activation free energies of different
steps (Table 1) clearly
reveals that the cyclization process is the rate-determining step
of the whole pathway.

Figure 4 Potential energy surfaces PESs) for pathway-5, 6, and
7 under Au-catalyzed
conditions.

Pathway-5 may be diverted
to pathway-6, when the intermediate 5-I5
undergoes 6-endo-dig attack to generate the hexannulated product 6-I6.
The energy profile in Figure 4 reveals that this step requires 15.11 kcal mol–1 energy and controls the global activation barrier (16.18 kcal mol–1) required for the whole process. Comparison of the
highest free energy barriers of pentannulation (pathway-5) reveals
that the energy requirement for pathway-5 is about 7 kcal mol–1 higher than that required for pathway-6. Hence, the
experimental report for the generation of a six-membered naphthyl
derivative6 is totally consistent with
our results for Au-catalyzed reactions. Energetically costly pathway-7
starts from intermediate 5-I3 and cyclizes to the naphthyl ring (7-I4)
through 7-TS3. However, the possibility of this mechanism can be discarded
because of the requirement of high energy (37.39 kcal mol–1) to cross the global activation barrier of the process.

Comparative
study of the pathways for generating five- and six-membered
ring structures under Pt-catalyzed (pathways-2 and 4) and Au-catalyzed
(pathways-5 and 6) conditions reveals that the pathways are diverged
from two critical stationary points, 1-I3 and 5-I5. These intermediates
may generate a five- or six-membered ring structure through 5-exo-dig
or 6-endo-dig cyclization. In the case of Pt-catalyzed conditions,
the favorable pathway follows 5-exo-dig through the transition state
1-TS3, which is 18.79 kcal mol–1 lower in free energy
than the transition structure 4-TS3. On the other hand, under Au-catalyzed
conditions, the intermediate 5-I5 follows the favorable 6-endo-dig
cyclization through 6-TS5 with a favorable free energy difference
of 6.98 kcal mol–1. To pinpoint the guiding factors,
we further study the development of aromaticity of the generated complexes
under two different metal-catalyzed conditions.

Analysis of
the Divergent Pathways of Annulations under Pt-
and Au-Catalyzed Conditions
Apparently, the formation of
the benzofulvene derivative through cyclization under platinum-catalyzed
conditions bypasses the formation of, the so-called more aromatic,
naphthalene derivative. To get a proper chemical insight on the favorability
of formation of an apparently less-stabilized, nonaromatic pentacyclic
ring structure, we analyzed the development of aromaticity by probing
the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS) (0) value (see Computational Methods) at several ring centers on
the changing structures along the reaction path of the annulation
step under two different metal-catalyzed conditions.

Our studied
results have been summarized in Figure 5 in which the upper two panels, (a,b), represent the
pentannulation and hexannulation pathways under platinum-catalyzed
conditions, whereas the lower panels, (c,d), represent the results
of the two respective annulations under gold-catalyzed conditions.
As evident from the four figures, the NICS(0) values at the geometric
center of the existing benzene ring (marked by blue diamond) show
the least variation in all the four cyclization processes. Under platinum-catalyzed
conditions (panels a and b in Figure 5), the center at the forming carbocyclic ring (marked
by pink circle) shows a small decrease in NICS values, indicating
the increase of aromaticity to a slight extent in both pentannulation
and hexannulation processes. The center of the ring containing the
Pt atom (marked by a black inverted triangle) shows an overall increase
in the NICS value for pentannulation though an overall decrease is
noted in the hexannulation pathway. The most notable change in the
NICS value for pentannulation is observed at the ring junction of
the carbocyclic and carboplatina ring (marked by brown square), where
a sharp decrease in NICS values take place at the vicinity of the
transition structure. When compared with the change in values for
the hexannulation pathway, it appears that during the pentannulation
process a strong ring current develops on the forming bicyclic ring-containing
Pt metal. Absence of such effects in hexannulation clearly indicates
that the pathway of pentannulation under Pt-catalyzed conditions generates
a relatively higher aromatic character and dictates the favorability
of the process. The geometric center between the existing and forming
ring junction (marked by red triangle) shows a variation for the pentannulation
under Au-catalyzed conditions (Figure 5c). However, a more decreased value in NICS is noted
during the hexannulation pathway (Figure 5d). The lower values clearly correlate with
our common sense for the development of an aromatic system while generating
the naphthalene ring. The center of the forming ring (marked by pink
circle) decreases more rapidly in Figure 5d than in Figure 5c, indicating the generation of more aromaticity,
while forming the naphthyl ring structure under Au-catalyzed conditions.
Hence, the overall development of the aromaticity in the Au-catalyzed
system is higher for the hexannulation process, consistent with the
experimentally observed fact.6

step of the allene intermediate under Pt (a,b)- and Au (c,d)-catalyzed
conditions. The solid black line describes the changes in energy.
The panels (a,c) represent the pentannulation path, whereas the panels
(b,d) represent the hexannulation pathway. Change in NICS(0) values
at different geometric centers are shown by various points.

It may further be noted that the
activation barrier required for
the platinum-catalyzed cyclization is much higher than that required
for the Au-catalyzed reaction (Table 1). The optimum conditions as reported in the literature
also support the fact that the platinum-catalyzed reaction requires
a relatively more drastic condition (80 °C, 12 h) with respect
to that required for the gold-catalyzed reaction (rt, 11 h).6,9 Close inspection on the molecular orbitals of the stationary point
reveals that the π-orbitals associated with the alkyne moiety
may fall under two categories which are orthogonal to each other (Figure 6). One set is perpendicular
to the plane of the ring, whereas the other set remains parallel to
the ring. For the convenience of our discussion, the π-orbitals
of the alkyne π-system that are coplanar or nearly coplanar
to the aromatic ring are termed as periplanar π-orbitals,
whereas those perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the aromatic
ring are designated as clinal π-orbitals.

Figure 6 Orientation
of the two orthogonal sets of the π-system in
the allene and alkyne moiety of enyne–allene.

It is evident from the figure that the periplanar
π-orbitals
associated with the alkyne and allene moiety are suitable to generate
σ-bonds for their correct orientation to overlap with the allene
orbitals. The periplanar π-orbitals of the alkyne moiety that
is proximal to the aromatic ring, when overlaps with the periplanar
π-orbitals of the central carbon atom of the allene system,
result in pentannulation through 5-exo-dig attack (path a), whereas
the corresponding distal p-orbital of alkyne gives the benzannulated
product through 6-endo-dig attack (path b).

Analysis of the
molecular orbitals associated with the intermediate,
transition state, and product of the cyclization steps reveals that
the Au-catalyzed cyclization progresses through the activation of
the periplanar π-orbitals of the alkyne moiety while forming
the transition structure. This results in the reduction of the activation
barrier. The unsaturated clinal π-orbitals get stabilized by
forming a part of the conjugated aromatic π-orbital of the generated
ring system (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Orbital activation through the coordination of the Au ion.

However, the molecular orbitals
associated with the stationary
points on Pt-catalyzed reactions reveal some different pictures.

The geometry of 1-I3 reveals that the Pt metal forms a chelate
complex by coordinating with two unsaturated π-orbitals of the
alkyne and allene system that are formed from the clinal π-orbitals.
While adopting the transition structure geometry (5-exo-dig or 6-endo-dig),
the periplanar π-orbitals are not directly activated by the
metal center and the forming σ-bonds leaves an unshared orbital
at the end of the process (Figure 8). While forming the six-membered ring system, the
two unsaturated π-orbitals that are already coordinated to the
metal ion would try to get stabilized by involving themselves in generating
π-orbitals of the newly generated aromatic ring. Obviously,
the process of cyclization should weaken the coordinate bond between
the unsaturation and the metal ion, and thus, the square planar geometry
of the complex is effectively destabilized. This effect is reflected
in the high activation barrier in the energy profile diagram (4-TS3
in Figure 3), and the
cyclized intermediate (4-I4 in Figure 3) has an energy very close to those of the transition
structures that generate it.

attack of the enyne–allene system.

Conclusions
In summary, we have made a comparative
study of the pathways of
pentannulation and hexannulation of the aromatic enediyne system,
under platinum(II) and gold(I) catalytic conditions. In agreement
with the reported experimental results, our study reveals that the
platinum-catalyzed pentannulation is a more favorable process than
the hexannulation pathway, whereas the gold-catalyzed reaction favors
hexannulation over pentannulation. In both the cases, the guiding
factor has been elucidated to be the increasing aromaticity. The aromatic
character of the naphthyl derivative, which is generated by the hexannulation
process in gold-catalyzed conditions, though, is quite apparent, such
behavior of the intermediate generated in platinum-catalyzed conditions
is quite difficult to recognize. Monitoring the change of NICS(0)
values with the change in the structure during the pentannulation
process under platinum-catalyzed conditions reveals that the metal
complex of the pentannulated ring gains more aromaticity than the
structure generated by the hexannulation pathway. Besides this, our
study also reveals that the acyl migration after pentannulation in
platinum-catalyzed conditions takes place through a favorable multistep
process, in which the assistance of the ligand of the metal is also
involved. This study reveals several intricate details of the mechanism
of the annulation reactions and also increases the chemical insight
on the studied pathway.

Computational Methods
For the study
of all pathways and analysis of the properties of
the individual species, we have used the density functional theory
quantum mechanical method implemented in the Gaussian suite.12 While choosing the proper functional to carry
out the search for stationary points, we were motivated by our previous
success of the study on other metal-catalyzed reactions.13 Our previous experience shows that the hybrid
density functional PBE014 gave consistent
results for Au-catalyzed reactions, and its utility had already been
endorsed by other reports. For selecting a favorable pathway, we presently
use the same functional (equivalent to PBE1PBE) and LANL2DZ15 basis set for metal atoms. The other atoms are
treated with the 6-31G(d,p) basis set.16 Optimizations and energy calculations were done by considering the
singlet multiplicity for each structure, and the restricted method
was used. The vibrational frequency calculation of the optimized stationary
points reveals whether the species is a minimum or transition structure
on the PES of the system. Some transition structures were further
confirmed with IRC calculation to relate the reactant and the product.
Further refinement of the energy barriers were made by single point
energy calculations on the optimized structures using the M06-2X17,18 functional and def2-QZVP basis set for metal atoms and the 6-311+G**
basis set for other atoms.19 Effect of
the solvent has been understood with the polarizable continuum model20 calculation, and this has been done on the single
point geometry of the gas phase optimized structure. ortho-Xylene has been used for Pt-catalyzed reactions, and dichloromethane
is used for Au-catalyzed reactions. Solvation free energies were calculated
by adding the solvation energies to the computed gas phase relative
free energies (ΔG353 for Pt-catalyzed
cyclizations and ΔG298 for Au-catalyzed
cyclizations, where the superscripts indicate the temperature in kelvin).
To test the developed aromatic character of the intermediate formed
during the cyclization steps under two different metal-catalyzed conditions,
the variation of the nucleus-independent chemical shift (NICS(0))
was examined along the reaction pathways.21 The NICS(0) method, introduced by Schleyer, is probably the most
common and convenient way to measure the aromaticity. Literature data
show their relevance and success for characterizing the aromatic behaviors
of a variety of chemical structures of intermediates and transition
states and act as a tool to study the developing aromaticity in a
process. In the present paper, all NICS(0) values were calculated
for transition structures and species on the IRC paths at the PBE0
level. While computing the NICS, we placed a ghost atom in the position
where we would like to compute the NICS. The output result is then
obtained using the NMR keyword in the Gaussian input file. The isotropic
magnetic shielding value at the ghost atom, when multiplied by −1,
gives us the NICS value. Because of numerous ambiguities in selecting
reference points for calculating NICS values, we have measured this
parameter at several single and fused ring centers of the changing
structures and analyzed the concerned problem by selecting the one
that gives interpretable result.
