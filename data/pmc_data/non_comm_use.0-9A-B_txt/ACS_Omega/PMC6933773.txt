Condensate banking represents a challenging problem in
producing
the hydrocarbon from tight gas reservoirs. The accumulation of liquid
condensates around the production well can significantly impair the
gas flow rate. Gas injection and hydraulic fracturing are the common
techniques used to avoid the condensate development by maintaining
the reservoir pressure above the dew point curve. However, these treatments
are associated with high operational costs and large initial investment.
This study presents a new chemical treatment for removing the condensate
banking using thermochemical solutions. The presented treatment can
cause a permanent impact on the treated formations. Chemicals are
injected to react downhole and generate in situ pressure and heat
in certain conditions. The generated pressure can raise the gas pressure
above the dew point, and the generated heat can change the phase of
the liquid condensate to gas. Kinetic analysis indicates that thermochemical
fluids can increase the temperature and heat by 85 °C and 369
kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, the impact of clay content on the
efficiency of thermochemical treatment was studied using coreflooding
experiments. A condensate removal of more than 60% was achieved using
the huff and puff injection mode. A good correlation between the rock
permeability and the condensate removal efficiency was observed. Higher
condensate removal was obtained for the rock samples with high permeability
values. Moreover, the presence of clay minerals in the treated rock
showed a minor impact on the condensate removal, indicating that the
injected chemicals are able to stabilize the clay minerals and avoid
clay damage. This research shows that thermochemical treatment can
remove more than 60% of the condensate damage for different types
of tight sandstones. Huff and puff treatment was found to be a very
practical approach to diminish the condensate banking from different
sandstone rocks. Also, this work confirms that thermochemical treatment
can be applied in the clayey formation for removing the condensate
blockage without affecting the clay stability or inducing clay damage.
Ultimately, this study introduces a new chemical treatment in the
gas industry, and the used chemicals are effective, environmentally
friendly, and not expensive.

1 Introduction
Natural gas is considered
as one of the cleanest types of fossil
fuels and one of the most eligible energy sources.1 Natural gas reservoirs represent important sources of energy
around the world; they provide more than 30% of the consumed energy.2,3 However, several problems can encounter the supply of natural gas.
In gas condensate reservoirs, condensate banking is one of the most
critical problems that occur due to the reservoir depletion and reduce
the gas recovery.4−6 During gas production, the reservoir pressure may
decrease below the dew point pressure, and then a significant amount
of the condensate liquid will develop and accumulate around the production
well.4 The accumulated liquid will impede
the flow of natural gas from the reservoir into the borehole, leading
to a significant decrease in the well productivity.7−11 The severity of condensate damage depends on several
factors, mainly the reservoir formation and the natural gas composition.4,12−15

Several treatments have been implemented to remove the condensate
blocking and restore the gas production.16−20 These methods rely on creating conductive paths,
altering the wettability condition, or increasing the pressure in
the region around the wellbore to the level above the dew point pressure.21,22 Also, the condensate treatments are used to improve the flow condition
and allow the easy production of the condensate liquid.23−25 The most common methods are gas recycling, hydraulic fracturing,
and wettability alteration treatments.16,17 The applicability
of these treatments depends on the reservoir characteristics and the
reasons that lead to the development of the condensate blockage. For
instance, wettability alteration treatments are applied to remove
the condensate banking from strong liquid-wet formation.26 Several chemicals can be injected to alter the
rock wettability from strong liquid-wet to the neutral wettability
condition, which will improve the gas productivity for a long time.2,27 Hydraulic fracturing operations are implemented in the condition
of extremely low permeability or significantly high capillary pressure.23,28 The induced fractures create conductive paths between the reservoir
and the wellbore and then enhance the process of condensate removal.28 Gas recycling methods are used to pressurize
the near-wellbore region to convert the condensate liquid into the
gaseous state.29,30 However, gas recycling offers
only a temporary improvement in the gas production, and the treatment
needs to be repeated every 3–6 months.19,31

Recently, thermochemical treatment was introduced as an effective
method for removing the condensate banking and improving the formation
productivity.16,19,32 Two reactive fluids are injected to react at the reservoir condition
and produce a significant amount of heat and pressure. The in situ
generated temperature and pressure can reach 500 °F and 5000
psi, respectively.33 The induced condition
significantly changes the condensate behavior32 and creates multiple fractures.17 Consequently,
it can mitigate the condensate damage and improve the formation deliverability
for long-term applications.19,34 However, the generated
heat and pressure can affect the well completion if they exceed the
specification limit of the downhole equipment. Therefore, the chemical
concentration and the treatment volume should be carefully determined
to remove the condensate banking without damaging the well completion.
Generally, increasing the chemical concentration or the injected volume
can lead to an increase in the generated pressure and heat. Moreover,
different injection modes can be applied to remove the condensate
banking from the tight formation using thermochemical treatment. The
chemical solutions can be injected using the continuous injection
method or the huff and puff technique.17,34 In fact, the
huff and puff method showed better performance than the continuous
injection because the same condensate removal can be obtained using
a less amount of the injected chemicals compared to the continuous
injection method.17

The performance
of condensate removal techniques depends on several
factors; one of these factors is the composition of treated formation.
Indeed, the presence of certain minerals in the formation can affect
the effectiveness of condensate removal methods. For example, if the
treated formation contains clay minerals, it may restrict the applicability
of several treatments due to the incompatibility between the injected
fluids and clay minerals. Injection of non-native fluids into clayey
formation can result in several types of formation damages such as
clay swelling and fine migration and, consequently, can reduce the
formation deliverability.35 Therefore,
to avoid formation damage, the suitable treatment for removing the
condensate banking should be selected based on the mineralogical composition
of treated formation.

This paper presents the performance of
thermochemical fluids in
mitigating the condensate damage from several types of sandstone formations.
Different sandstone rocks (Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera) were used;
coreflooding experiments were conducted using the huff and puff injection
mode. Four cycles of injection and production periods were applied
to remove the condensate liquid from the treated samples. The in situ
generated pressures due to the thermochemical reaction were monitored,
and the removed condensate per cycle was determined. The impact of
rock mineralogy on the condensate removal was studied, and the relationship
between the core permeability and the performance of thermochemical
fluids was discussed.

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 Condensate Removal in Scioto Sandstone
Thermochemical fluids were injected into a Scioto rock sample to
remove the condensate liquid and improve the rock conductivity. The
used core sample has an average permeability of 0.89 mD, a porosity
of 17.6%, and the total clay content (illite, kaolinite, and chlorite)
of 23%. The thermochemical solutions were injected in four cycles
using the huff and puff technique. Figure 1 shows the profiles of the removed condensate
and the pore pressures at the core inlet and outlet. Injection of
thermochemical fluids into the Scioto rock sample showed an effective
performance in removing the condensate damage; 65% of the original
condensate liquid was removed. The highest condensate removal was
achieved during the first cycle; 56.4% of the liquid bank was removed.
The second cycle provides moderate removal of the condensate bank
with incremental condensate removal of 4.3%. While the third and fourth
cycles of the huff and puff treatment showed lower condensate removal,
2.2 and 2.1% of the original condensate were removed during the third
and fourth cycles, respectively. The profile of condensate removal
indicates that two cycles of huff and puff treatment are sufficient
to remove more than 60% of the condensate damage. Therefore, three
cycles can be considered as the optimum number of huff and puff treatment
to mitigate the condensate banking.

Figure 1 Profiles of condensate removal and pore
pressures during huff and
puff treatment using a Scioto rock sample. More than 60% of the trapped
condensate was removed using thermochemical fluids.

In addition, the profiles of inlet and outlet pressures,
during
the condensate removal treatment, indicate that the maximum pressure
of 1940 psi can be in situ generated due to the thermochemical reaction,
as shown in Figure 1. In the first cycle, the inlet and outlet pressures increased to
890 psi, while in the second cycle, the pressures reached 1940 psi,
which indicates that reducing the saturation of the condensate liquid
can generate a higher pore pressure during the thermochemical treatment.
Removing the condensate liquid from the pore medium provides more
space for the injected chemicals to react and generate a higher pore
pressure. The third cycle of huff and puff confirms that a higher
pore pressure can be in situ generated, due to the thermochemical
reaction, at lower condensate saturations. However, the fourth cycle
shows lower pressure values; the maximum pressure during this cycle
is 1680 psi, which is lower than the pressure generated during the
third cycle by 230 psi. The decrease in the in situ generated pressure
could be due to the presence of spent fluids inside the pore space,
which have already reacted during the previous cycles of injection.

During thermochemical injection, a significant amount of heat is
generated due to the reaction between the injected fluids. The generated
heat can raise the condensate temperature up to 120 °C and therefore
the condensate viscosity will reduce considerably. Increasing the
temperature from around 80 to 120 °C will reduce the condensate
viscosity by 39%; the condensate viscosities are 0.94 and 0.57 cP
before and after thermochemical injection, respectively. Consequently,
the condensate mobility will improve by a factor of 1.65. Furthermore,
the in situ generated pressure due to the thermochemical reaction
can efficiently contribute to mobilizing the trapped condensate liquid
by increasing the pore pressure. In general, injection treatments
can be used to pressurize the hydrocarbon reservoirs and hence increase
the pressure difference between the average reservoir pressure and
the bottomhole flowing pressure. Increasing the drawdown pressure
can improve the hydrocarbon flowing from the reservoir into the borehole.
A similar mechanism can be achieved by injecting the thermochemical
solutions into gas condensate reservoirs. The induced pressure during
thermochemical treatment can increase the pressure around the wellbore
and help in removing the condensate liquid. Also, the generated pressure
can significantly affect the reservoir formations. For example, multiple
fractures can be induced during the thermochemical treatment. In this
work, NMR measurements were carried out before and after the chemical
injections to evaluate the changes in rock samples. The effects of
heat and pressure pulse generated during the thermochemical treatment
on the clay minerals in the sandstone rocks are studied using the
profiles of T2 relaxation time. Figure 2 shows the T2 relaxation time for a Scioto rock sample
before and after the condensate treatment using thermochemical fluids.
Multiple fractures were induced in the rock sample due to the in situ
generated pressure during thermochemical treatment. The induced fractures
are indicated by the second peak in the incremental porosity profile.
As a result of the fracture generation, the cumulative porosity was
increased from 17.6 to 18.4%. The generated fractures will significantly
improve the pore connectivity and reduce the capillary pressure. The
core permeability was increased by more than 50% due to the injection
of thermochemical fluids. Ultimately, the generated heat and pressure
during the thermochemical reaction can considerably change the condensate
and rock properties and lead to efficient condensate removal.

and cumulative porosity profiles for a Scioto rock
sample, before and after thermochemical treatment. Multiple fractures
were generated due to the chemical injection.

2.2 Condensate Removal in Kentucky Sandstone
Figure 3 shows the
performance of thermochemical fluids in mitigating the condensate
blockage for a Kentucky rock sample. For this sandstone sample, the
core permeability is 0.64 mD, the cumulative porosity is 15.39%, and
the clay content is 14%. The total condensate removal of 62.5% was
achieved using four cycles of thermochemical injection. The cumulative
condensate recovery is distributed as 42.2% during the first cycle,
11.2% during the second cycle, 6.94% during the third cycle, and 2.14%
during the fourth cycle. The volume of removed condensate decreases
as the cycle number increases, mainly due to the reduction in the
remaining condensate volume with the cycle number. The profile of
condensate removal indicates that three cycles of huff and puff treatment
are required to mitigate the condensate banking, with a removal efficiency
of more than 60% of the original condensate in place.

Figure 3 Profiles of condensate
removal and pressures for a Kentucky rock
sample during thermochemical treatment. Four cycles of chemical injection
remove 62.5% of the condensate bank.

Also, Figure 3 shows
the pressure profiles at the core inlet and outlet during the thermochemical
treatment. For all cycles, the soaking and production durations were
determined based on the pressure profiles. Sufficient time (20–60
min) was provided to allow the pore pressure to stabilize along the
rock samples and to make sure that the thermochemical reaction is
completed. The maximum pressure of 1350 psi was in situ generated
during the fourth cycle of chemical injection, while the minimum generated
pressure was 759 psi, which was observed during the first cycle. Overall,
the in situ generated pressure increases as the cycle number increases;
this confirms the previous observation that a higher pressure can
be in situ generated at low condensate saturation. Figure 4 shows the T2 profiles for
a Kentucky rock sample before and after condensate treatment using
thermochemical injection. After the treatment, multiple fractures
were created due to the in situ generated pressure and the cumulative
core porosity increased from 15.38% to 15.73%. Also, the permeability
measurements after the chemical treatment indicate that the core permeability
was increased by a factor of 1.7.

Figure 4 Incremental and cumulative porosity profiles
for a Kentucky rock
sample, before and after condensate removal using thermochemical fluids.

2.3 Condensate Removal in Bandera Sandstone
Thermochemical treatment was used to mitigate the condensate damage
from a Bandera rock sample. The used sandstone sample has an absolute
permeability of 13.12 mD, a porosity of 20.83%, and the total clay
content of 12%. Figure 5 shows the performance of thermochemical solutions in removing the
condensate liquid from Bandera sandstone. A cumulative condensate
removal of 72.97% was achieved using four cycles of the huff and puff
injection method. The highest incremental removal was obtained during
the first cycle; the incremental condensate removal was 43.12%. On
the other hand, the incremental condensate recoveries were 18.24,
8.29, and 3.32% during the second, third, and fourth cycles of huff
and puff treatment, respectively. As expected, lower condensate removal
was achieved during the fourth production cycle, which is attributed
to the reduction in the remaining condensate volume inside the treated
core sample. Although the fourth cycle provided 3.3% condensate removal,
three cycles of huff and puff would be enough to mitigate the condensate.
The main mechanism for removing the condensate bank from Bandera sandstone
is the viscosity reduction. The in situ generated heat can reduce
the condensate viscosity by a factor of 1.39; the fluid viscosities
are 0.94 and 0.57 cP before and after thermochemical injection, respectively.

Figure 5 Results
of treatment of Bandera sandstone with thermochemical solutions.
72.9% of the condensate liquid was removed using four cycles of chemical
injection.

Figure 5 also shows
the in situ generated pressure due to the thermochemical reaction
during all huff and puff cycles. In general, the pore pressure increases
with injection cycles; the highest pressure was in situ generated
during the fourth cycle of thermochemical injection. The in situ generated
pressures were 948, 1556, 1843, and 2095 psi during the first, second,
third, and fourth cycles of huff and puff treatment, respectively.
The pressure profiles indicate that a significant pressure (up to
2000 psi) can be in situ generated during the thermochemical treatment.
Also, during all production cycles, the outlet pressures are almost
equal, and no pressure buildup was observed, indicating that no formation
damage was induced during the thermochemical treatment. The changes
in the Bandera rock sample due to thermochemical injection were investigated
using NMR measurements. Figure 6 shows the T2 relaxation time for the Bandera sandstone sample
before and after the thermochemical treatment. Due to thermochemical
injection, the incremental porosity curve shifted slightly toward
the higher relaxation time, indicating pore enlargement. Hence, the
cumulative porosity increased by around 5% and the core porosity increased
from 20.83 to 21.90% after the chemical treatment. Also, the core
permeability was increased by more than 40% due to the injection of
thermochemical fluids. Ultimately, injecting thermochemical solutions
into Bandera rock can remove more than 70% of the condensate bank,
without inducing any formation damage.

Figure 6 T2 relaxation time for
the Bandera sandstone sample before and
after the thermochemical treatment. The incremental porosity curve
changed slightly, and the cumulative porosity increased from 20.83
to 21.90% after the treatment.

2.4 Comparison Study
Figure 7 shows the effectiveness of
thermochemical fluids in mitigating the condensate damage for different
sandstones. The cumulative condensate removal values are 65.03, 62.50,
and 72.97% for Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera rock samples, respectively.
A good correlation between the core permeability and the condensate
removal efficiency was observed. Higher condensate removal was obtained
for the rock sample with a higher permeability value. Injecting thermochemical
fluids into the Bandera sample (a permeability of 13.12 mD) resulted
in the highest condensate removal (72.97%). While treating Kentucky
sandstone with thermochemical solutions showed the lowest condensate
recovery, the core permeability for Kentucky rock was 0.64 mD and
the condensate removal was 62.5%. The presence of clay minerals in
the treated rock showed a minor impact on the condensate removal.
More than 60% of the condensate liquid was removed from Scioto rock
that has a clay content of more than 20%, indicating that the injected
chemicals can stabilize the clay minerals and avoid clay damage. In
fact, the thermochemical reaction produces a considerable amount of
NaCl salt along with nitrogen gas (N2) and steam (H2O), as shown in eq 1. The presence of NaCl salt in the reaction products contributes
to the stabilization of the clay minerals and protection against the
clay damage.

Figure 7 Cumulative condensate recovery during thermochemical injection
into Scioto (S1), Kentucky (S2), and Bandera (S3) rocks.

Figure 8 shows the
pressure profiles during thermochemical injection into Scioto, Kentucky,
and Bandera rock samples. The highest in situ generated pressure (2095
psi) was observed during the injection of thermochemical fluids into
Bandera sandstone, while the lowest pressure of 774 psi was obtained
by treating Kentucky samples with the thermochemical fluids. The pressure
profiles reveal that a higher pressure can be generated by injecting
thermochemical fluids into permeable sandstone (such as Bandera),
and less pressure generation is associated with the tight formations
(like Kentucky). The core permeabilities are 13.12 and 0.64 mD for
Bandera and Kentucky rocks, respectively. Moreover, the pressure profiles
confirm that no clay swelling or solid migration was induced during
the thermochemical treatment because no pressure buildup was observed
in the outlet core during all production cycles.

Figure 8 Pore pressure profiles
during thermochemical treatment using Scioto
(S1), Kentucky (S2), and Bandera (S3) rock samples.

Figure 9 shows the
incremental condensate removal against the cycle number. The incremental
profiles indicate that three cycles of huff and puff treatment can
be sufficient to mitigate the condensate banking. For all sandstone
samples, more than 60% of the condensate liquid was removed using
three injection cycles. However, in practical field applications,
a greater number of huff and puff injection cycles might be required
to mitigate the condensate banking in tight reservoirs. Tight formations
are characterized by high capillary pressures that hold the formation
fluids and restrain the flow of the condensate liquid toward the wellbore.
The formation tightness can restrict the condensate removal; hence,
more cycles of thermochemical injection would be required to alleviate
the condensate damage and improve the hydrocarbon flow.

Figure 9 Incremental
condensate removal against the cycle number for Scioto
(S1), Kentucky (S2), and Bandera (S3) rock samples.

In addition, the impact of clay content on the
performance of thermochemical
solutions in removing the condensate damage from sandstone rocks is
studied. Figure 10 shows a cross plot between the total clay content and condensate
removal using thermochemical treatment. The clay content showed a
minor impact on the performance of thermochemical treatment; a correlation
coefficient of less than 0.2 was observed. For all rock samples, condensate
removal of more than 60% was obtained regardless of the clay content,
indicating the good performance of thermochemical solutions in stabilizing
the clay mineral and avoiding the clay damage. Moreover, the relation
between condensate removal and core permeability was investigated. Figure 11 shows the condensate
removal against core permeability on the semilog scale. A good correlation
was observed between the condensate removal and the log of core permeability;
the correlation coefficient was 0.98. Increasing the core permeability
showed higher condensate removal, which can be attributed to three
reasons. First, the injected thermochemical fluids can penetrate for
longer distances in the permeable rocks and then more condensate will
be affected by the injected chemicals. Second, the higher permeability
indicates a good pore connectivity; hence, the condensate liquid can
easily flow with low pressure difference. Finally, high formation
permeability reveals a lower capillary pressure, which means better
flow condition for the liquid condensate. Ultimately, injecting thermochemical
fluids into permeable formations can result in higher condensate removal
compared to tight formations. Thermochemical treatment showed condensate
removal of 72.9 and 62.5% from permeable and tight sandstones, respectively.

fluids.

core permeability.

Ultimately, this study introduces a new chemical
treatment for
removing the condensate banking from different sandstone formations
using thermochemical fluids. The used chemicals are effective, environmentally
friendly, and not expensive. The proposed chemical treatment can be
applied in the gas field to remove the trapped condensate and improve
the gas production without inducing any formation damage, such as
clay swelling or permeability impairment. Also, the in situ generation
of temperature and pressure can reduce the energy losses and improve
the treatment performance. The chemical concentration and the treatment
volume can be selected to remove the condensate blockage without inducing
sand production issues.

3 Conclusions
This paper presents the
performance of thermochemical fluids in
mitigating the condensate banking from three sandstone rocks. Core
samples from Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera formations were used, and
coreflooding experiments were conducted using the huff and puff technique.
The profiles of condensate recovery and pore pressure were utilized
to assess the effectiveness of thermochemical fluids in alleviating
the condensate damage. Based on this work, the following conclusions
can be drawn:Thermochemical fluids are effective chemicals for removing
the condensate bank from different sandstone formations; a condensate
removal of 67% can be achieved on average.

Injecting thermochemical fluids into clayey sandstone
does not induce any formation damage, and no clay swelling or solid
migration was observed for all treated samples.

The produced salt from the thermochemical reaction can
stabilize the clay minerals and avoid permeability impairment.

A good correlation was observed between
the condensate
removal using thermochemical fluids and the log of core permeability,
and the correlation coefficient was 0.98.

Thermochemical treatment showed higher condensate removal
for the permeable rocks, while moderate liquid removal was obtained
for the tight sandstones.

During thermochemical
treatment, higher pressure can
be in situ generated during the third and fourth injection cycles,
due to the reduction of condensate saturation.

Multiple fractures were induced due to the generated
pressure during thermochemical injection, and the cumulative core
porosity was increased for all rock samples.

For different sandstone formations, three cycles of
thermochemical treatment can be enough to mitigate the condensate
damage, with a removal efficiency of more than 60%.

4.1 Materials
In this study, three types
of sandstone rocks (Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera) were used, and
the mineralogical compositions of these rocks are listed in Table 1. All samples showed
high percentages of quartz; 70, 66, and 61% were observed for the
Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera rock samples, respectively. Scioto sandstone
has the total clay content (illite, kaolinite, and chlorite) of 23%,
while the clay contents of Kentucky and Bandera core samples are 14
and 12%, respectively. Bandera samples showed a considerable amount
of iron, as indicated by the percentages of chlorite and ankerite,
which are iron-rich minerals. The used rock samples have an average
porosity of 17.94%, while the permeability values are 0.89, 0.64,
and 13.12 mD for Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera rock samples, respectively. Table 2 summarizes the petrophysical

In addition, an actual condensate liquid was used
in this work,
and the viscosity and the American Petroleum Institute (API) gravity
of this condensate were 1.8 cP and 48 API, respectively. Figure 12 shows the condensate
viscosity and density at different temperatures. A logarithmic relationship
was observed between the condensate viscosity and temperature (R2 is 0.99), while a linear mathematical model
can represent the relation between the condensate density and temperature.
Moreover, thermochemical fluids that consist of sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) were used. The
used chemicals were stable and compatible with the high level of temperature
and formation salinity. Acetic acid was injected with thermochemical
fluids to change the system pH and activate the chemical reaction.
Kinetic analysis was conducted to understand the performance of thermochemical
fluids in different conditions. The impact of the system pressure
and temperature and the presence of hydrocarbons on the generated
pressure and heat from the thermochemical reaction was studied. A
microreactor was used to carry out the kinetic study, and the profiles
of pressure and temperature were monitored using a data acquisition
system. Kinetic analysis of the used chemicals indicates that thermochemical
fluids can increase the temperature and heat by 85 °C and 369
kJ/mol, respectively, on average. Also, the thermochemical reaction
shows first-order behavior with an activation energy of 35 kJ/mol,
while the reaction rate constant (Kr)
varies between 0.0013 and 0.015 s–1 based on the
system temperature. The chemical reaction between sodium nitrite and
ammonium chloride can be represented by eq 1(32,38) 1

4.2 Experiments
A coreflooding system
was used to perform the condensate removal treatment; thermochemical
solutions were injected into the sandstone rocks to remove the condensate
bank. The experimental setup consists of a core holder, an oven, injection
pumps, back pressure regulators, and a data logging system. The coreflooding
system was designed to withstand a pressure of up to 10 000
psi and a temperature of up to 400 °C, and the logging system
could record the data every 5 s. The preparation of rock samples was
conducted by saturating the core samples with the condensate liquid
at high-pressure conditions. In this work, the worst-case scenario
of complete condensate plugging was studied. All core samples were
prepared for the chemical treatment by saturating the rocks with the
condensate liquid at high pressure for a sufficient time; thereafter,
the thermochemical treatment was conducted. The treatment was performed
by injecting the reactive fluids into the rock samples to remove the
condensate. The huff and puff technique was applied by injecting the
thermochemical fluids into the core sample in four cycles. In each
cycle, around 2 mL of the reactive fluids was injected, and the chemical
concentrations and the injected volumes were kept constant for all
flooding experiments. The chemicals were injected to react at the
core inlet; then, the core sample was soaked for a suitable time (20–40
min) to allow the injected chemicals to interact with the trapped
condensate and the rock matrix. Thereafter, the condensate liquid
was produced. The pressure profiles and the removed condensate volume
were recorded with time. The duration of each injection cycle was
determined based on the stability of pressure along the treated core
sample, and the production period was determined based on the produced
volume of the condensate liquid.

In addition, NMR (nuclear magnetic
resonance) was used to characterize the rock samples before the condensate
treatment. The rocks samples were prepared for the NMR measurements
by cleaning the samples using the Soxhlet extraction apparatus; then,
the samples were saturated with 3 wt % KCl brine at 3000 psi for 48
h. To minimize the NMR uncertainty, we applied the same experimental
conditions for the NMR measurements before and after the chemical
treatment. NMR measurements were performed on 3 wt % KCl brine-solution-saturated
cores to measure the T2 relaxation time. The core samples
were wrapped with a NMR-silent material using a tested operation to
prevent any saturation loss during the test. All NMR measurements
were carried out at ambient pressure and temperature. Figures 13 and 14 show the incremental and cumulative porosity profiles for all core
samples used in this work. The T2 peaks are 22.38, 29.2, and 79.43
ms for the Scioto, Kentucky, and Bandera rock samples, respectively,
which indicates that the Bandera sandstone sample has the largest
pore throat among all core samples (Figure 13). The cumulative porosity profiles (Figure 14) show that the
Kentucky (S2) sample has the lowest porosity value (15.4 porosity
unit, p.u.), while Scioto and Bandera samples have cumulative porosities
of 17.6 and 20.8 pu, respectively.
