Insoluble
rust waste from the scraping of rusted iron-containing
materials represents a cheap, eco-friendly, and available source of
iron. LaFeO3 perovskite-type powders were successfully
prepared by solution combustion synthesis using rust waste from an
electricity transmission tower manufacturer. Solution combustion synthesis
enabled introduction of this insoluble iron precursor directly into
the final product, bypassing complex extraction procedures. Catalytic
activity in the propylene oxidation of the waste-derived LaFeO3 with stoichiometric Fe/La ratio was almost identical to the
commercial iron nitrate-derived LaFeO3, thus demonstrating
the viability of this recycling solution. The amount of waste iron
precursor was varied and its effect on the powder properties was investigated.
A lesser stoichiometric amount of precursor produced a LaFeO3–La2O3 binary system, whereas a higher
stoichiometric amount led to a LaFeO3–Fe2O3 binary system. Catalytic activity of iron-rich compositions
in the propylene oxidation was only slightly lower than the stoichiometric
one, whereas iron-poor compositions were much less active. This eco-friendly
methodology can be easily extended to other iron perovskites with
different chemical compositions and to other iron-containing compounds.

==== Body
Introduction
The iron element is
present in most of the perovskite-type catalyst
formulations for application in pollution control, solar conversion,
oxygen separation, electrochemical production, and storage of energy
and sensoristics.1−5 The presence of iron at B-site of the ABO3 perovskite
structure ensures very good reactivity toward oxygen and oxygenated
compounds. Iron perovskites are usually prepared from a commercial
iron nitrate precursor,2,3 but sustainable methodologies
to obtain iron-containing catalysts from waste-derived iron-rich sources
are highly desirable, according to the concepts of circular economy
promoted by the European Commission.6 Most
of the experimental procedures proposed in the literature for iron
waste recycling deal with the synthesis of other materials and not
perovskites. For example, waste ferrous sulfate from titanium dioxide
industry,7 heavy tonnage iron-removal sludge
waste,8 oily cold rolling mill sludge,
and ashes of scum from anaerobic treatment of municipal sewage9 have been used as inorganic precursors for preparing
iron-based pigments or hematite nanoparticles. Recently, rusted iron
coil and stainless steel wires have also been used for preparing hematite
film with water oxidation and oxygen evolution activity.10 Apparently, only in the works by Pullar et al.11 and Dufour et al.12 a perovskite-type barium hexaferrite magnetic material has been
produced from dried steel wiredrawing sludge waste as iron source.
Waste iron, which is produced from the scraping of rusted iron-containing
materials, can also be used as an iron source for the synthesis of
nanomaterials with high catalytic activity and selectivity13−15 and represents a cheap, eco-friendly, and inexhaustible source of
iron. In fact, if rust has already been formed, rust scraping is necessary
to remove rust from the surface, preventing the iron objects from
further damage. This rust must be disposed of as waste or dismissed
as scrap iron at very low rates.

The aim of this work is to
evaluate the possibility of using rust
waste from scraping as a source of iron for the synthesis of an iron
perovskite such as LaFeO3 nanomaterial. This iron-based
compound was selected as a proof-of-concept material for three main
reasons: (i) with respect to other multicomponent and doped perovskites,
the simplicity of this chemical composition limits any possible segregation
and avoids useless complexity of the interpretation of the results,
in line with the literature;16,17 (ii) the preparation
of a perovskite compound instead of a simple iron-based oxide expands
the applicability of the synthesis to a wider class of iron-based
compounds and to a variety of technological uses; and (iii) LaFeO3 itself shows a discrete catalytic activity as an oxidation
catalyst for carbon monoxide, nitrous oxide, methane, soot, and volatile
organic compounds (VOCs).18,19

For the preparation
of LaFeO3 powders, we chose the
solution combustion synthesis, an easy and convenient solution-based
method for the preparation of mixed oxides and in particular perovskite-type
compounds.20 The core of this methodology
is a self-sustained redox reaction between a fuel and an oxidant in
the presence of metal precursors. The combustion process is a very
fast reaction (about 10–20 s), which transforms fuel and oxidant
into gases, leaving the desired powdered product. A further thermal
treatment may be necessary, depending on the experimental conditions
used and the chemical composition.20 Both
sol–gel chemistry and propellant chemistry play an important
role in the solution combustion synthesis. The formation of a gel
network before the self-sustained combustion is an essential part
of the synthesis since all of the components of the combustion mixture
are “fixed” in the network. Therefore, if they interacted
well in the network, the right products will form during the combustion
process or the subsequent thermal treatment.20 This methodology allows the direct use of solid waste precursors,
bypassing any complex extraction procedure.20 In fact, most of the procedures proposed in the literature to recycle
the waste iron make use of extraction by strong acids to dissolve
the solid iron precursor.9,14,15,21 For the sake of comparison, reference
LaFeO3 powder was also prepared by solution combustion
synthesis using a commercial iron nitrate precursor. Several characterization
techniques were used in this work to understand in detail the effect
of the waste iron precursor amount on the chemical–physical
properties of the obtained LaFeO3 powders and to compare
the waste iron precursor with the commercial one. The performance
of all of the LaFeO3 powders was evaluated by testing the
activity and selectivity in the oxidation of propylene, a VOC air
pollutant emitted from car exhaust gases. Propylene is usually fully
oxidized to CO2 by using heterogeneous catalysts based
on mixed oxides and metal nanoparticles.22 Recently, it has been found that LaFeO3 is able to catalyze
propylene oxidation.23

Results and Discussion
Features
of the Waste Iron Precursor
Qualitative analysis
of X-ray diffraction patterns in Figure 1 indicated that the as-received rust waste
(red line) was composed of metallic iron and iron oxides. This is
not surprising since the scraping treatment is known to take out the
rusted layer together with the Fe3O4 and metallic
iron underlying layers. It was not possible to discriminate the type
of iron oxides (FeO, Fe3O4, Fe2O3, or hydrated Fe2O3) from the XRD pattern
analysis because of the low XRD signal of such a multicomponent material
formed by powder and chippings (Figure 1).

Figure 1 XRD pattern of the rust waste before (red line) and after
(gray
line) the cleaning treatment.

Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) results in Figure S1 indicated that hydrated Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 compounds were the
main constituents
of the first few micrometers of the as-received rust waste surface.
According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, the
surface of the as-received rust waste contained only iron from hematite
particles and produced a neat survey spectrum without any contaminant
(Figure S2). Scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) images of the as-received rust waste (Figure 2, in the red box) confirmed the presence
of zones with different features (A–C) due to the multicomponent
nature of this solid waste.

Figure 2 SEM images at two different enlargements of
the as-received rust
waste (left column, in the red box) and of the washed one (right column,
in the gray box). “A” indicates the metallic iron cubes,
“B” indicates the Fe3O4 elongated
crystals, and “C” indicates the roundish (hydrated)
hematite particles.

According to energy-dispersive
X-ray (EDX) analysis, the micrometric
cubes visible in the as-received rust waste (Figure 2, top left, feature A), with a Fe/O atomic
ratio of 70, are mainly ascribable to metallic iron, present in the
rust waste as a result of the scraping, considering the larger amount
of iron compared to oxygen. The elongated crystals (Figure 3, bottom left, feature B),
with a Fe/O atomic ratio of 43:57, were clearly associated with magnetite
(Fe/O = 0.75). The agglomerated roundish particles (Figure 3, bottom left, feature C),
with a Fe/O atomic ratio of 57:43 (1.32), indicated a major presence
of (hydrated) hematite crystals (Fe/O = 1.5). Therefore, the as-received
rust waste was composed of an inner layer of metallic iron, a middle
layer of Fe3O4, and a surface layer of FeOOH,
in agreement with the literature.24

Figure 3 XRD patterns
of the rust waste-derived sample (A) and the reference
sample (B). The image of the structure represents the unit cell of
the LaFeO3 perovskite-type compounds. All of the pictures
were taken by the authors.

After the cleaning procedure, the only apparent effect to
the XRD
pattern is a decreased percentage of metallic iron compared to the
percentage of iron oxides (Figure 1). XPS analysis of the surface did not detect any visible
change in the Fe 2p peak (Figure S3). SEM–EDX
images of the rust wastes after the cleaning treatment (Figure 2, in the gray box) indicated
that the agglomerated roundish particles represent the majority of
the powder (Figure 2, bottom right, feature C), whereas some short crystals of Fe3O4 were still visible (Figure 2, bottom right, feature B), in agreement
with the XRD results. Therefore, it can be concluded that the cleaning
treatment has essentially the effect of eliminating any suspended
impurity, decreasing the metallic iron percentage and slightly increasing
the hydrated hematite surface layer present on the solid rust waste.

Waste Iron Precursor or Commercial Iron Precursor? A Comparison
The combustion process, the main chemical–physical properties,
and the catalytic activity in the propylene oxidation of a LaFeO3 prepared from the waste iron precursor (R053) were compared
to those of a LaFeO3 prepared from commercial iron nitrate
precursor (FeNit), to investigate the effect of the iron precursor
type on the material properties. The stoichiometric amount of waste
iron precursor was determined experimentally according to a procedure
described in the Supporting Information (p S17).

Temperature/time profiles of R053 and FeNit denoted
a multistep nature of the process, highlighted by the presence of
more than one temperature/time peak in each profile and/or by the
presence of asterisks, each of them corresponding to a stimulation
of the combustion process through manual mixing (Figure S4). This is mainly ascribable to the high Φ
(reducer-to-oxidizer ratio) value used for the synthesis, since over-stoichiometric
Φ values are known to decrease the intensity of the combustion
process and may cause local interruption of the combustion wave.20 The multistep nature of the combustion process,
other than representing an obstacle to the synthesis, can be considered
as an advantage for mass production of the powdered product. In fact,
a combustion process with lower intensity allows increasing the amount
of powder produced at the same level of risk.20 By comparing the profiles in Figure S4, it is worth noting that the maximum temperature registered for
R053 is 100 °C higher than that for FeNit. Besides the difficulty
in registering a direct measurement of the temperature for multistep
combustion processes (comment to Figure S4), the combustion of R053 was more intense than for FeNit also at
visual perception. This difference was ascribed to an effect of the
iron precursor type. In fact, insoluble particles of iron precursor
were still suspended in the gel mass of R053 before combustion, and
their fast oxidation might be responsible for the higher intensity
of the combustion process in this sample. It can be concluded that
there was no influence of the iron precursor type on the multistep
nature of the combustion process, but the local combustion waves were
slightly more intense in the case of the waste-derived powder.

The perovskite-type LaFeO3 structure was already formed
in both the as-burned powders (Figure S5). Traces of lanthanum oxides and iron oxides were present in the
XRD patterns of both the as-burned powders, as shown in Figure S5, where only the most intense peaks
of these secondary phases were indicated. This is not surprising since
perovskite phase is usually formed from the respective oxides. No
metallic iron was left unreacted in R053. We assumed that iron incorporation
into the LaFeO3 perovskite structure was strongly promoted
by the interaction of metallic iron/iron oxides with citric acid through
chemisorption and by the intense redox reaction during combustion.
After calcination at 700 °C, the perovskite structure was fully
formed (Figure 3).

Cell volume of the FeNit reference, as determined by Rietveld refinement,
was 242.85 ± 0.04 Å3, in agreement with the literature.23 Cell volume of the waste-derived LaFeO3 was 243.01 ± 0.05 Å3, slightly larger, probably
due to a higher oxygen defectivity provoked by a size/strain effect.
In fact, the crystal size of the perovskite phase in R053 was 50 nm,
slightly smaller than for the reference sample (63 nm). In addition,
microstrain was larger for the waste-derived sample (0.182 compared
to 0.071), indicating a larger perturbation of the powder structure/microstructure.
Looking at the structural properties of the perovskite powders, the
waste iron was comparable to the commercial iron nitrate as iron precursor
for the solution combustion synthesis of LaFeO3 nanopowders.

From the SEM images of Figure 4, it appears evident that the type of iron precursor
influenced the microstructure and morphology of these samples.

Figure 4 SEM images
at two different enlargements, of the waste-derived
sample (left column, in the blue box) in comparison to the reference
sample (right column, in the black box).

In both cases, the powders consisted of particles with size
ranging
between ca. 35 and 140 nm, considering that the largest ones were
only observed in the case of FeNit sample. This is in good agreement
with the crystal size values calculated from XRD analysis. Moreover,
the particles of the sample obtained by waste iron (R053) had a prevalently
roundish shape, whereas those of the reference powder (FeNit), obtained
from the commercial iron nitrate, were less regular and in some cases
appear elongated or fused with each other. After calcination at 1000
°C, grain size increased for both samples, although the observed
differences were maintained (Figure S6),
in agreement with crystal size values obtained by XRD analysis. This
important result shows for the first time a microstructural templating
effect of the inorganic precursor used in the solution combustion
synthesis. It is worth noting that to date, the main microstructural
templating effect has been attributed to the fuel or an external template.20 EDX analysis performed during SEM observations
registered slightly larger Fe/La ratios than the nominal ones for
both the samples (1.3 for R053 and 1.2 for FeNit), whereas microwave
plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (MP-AES) confirmed the stoichiometric
nature of the Fe/La ratio in FeNit and R053.

Fe depletion/La
enrichment on the surface was observed by XPS in
both samples (Fe/La was 0.5 for R053 and 0.6 for FeNit), in agreement
with the literature.25 The downshift of
Fe 2p peaks from 711.0 to 710.7 eV (FeNit) and 710.5 eV (R053) confirmed
the incorporation of iron in the perovskite structure of both R053
and FeNit samples (Figure 5). Indeed, lanthanum position (ca. 834 eV) in R053 and FeNit
was very similar (Figure 5) and typical of perovskite-type materials.23,26

Figure 5 O
1s and Fe 2p XPS images of waste iron in comparison to those
of R053 and FeNit.

Oxygen peaks of the perovskite-type
powders contained components
due to perovskites lattice (subsurface) at ca. 529 eV and to surface
oxygen at about 531 eV, generated by OH terminal groups. The OH contribution
in R053 was much larger than that in FeNit, in agreement with the
smaller crystal size, smaller grain size, and slightly larger surface
area.

Reduction profiles of R053 and FeNit are displayed in Figure S7a, and the hydrogen consumption values
are summarized in Table S1. Both the temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) curves showed two main reduction regions. The first
one was registered below 800 °C with small hydrogen consumption,
whereas the main reduction process started above 800 °C. The
TPR profiles of Figure S7a are in agreement
with the literature, according to which the reduction of LaFeO3 takes place in two steps and involves the Fe3+ to Fe2+ reduction at lower temperatures and the Fe2+ to Fe0 reduction at higher temperatures.18 However, in both the samples, the main reduction
peak did not reach completeness even at 1000 °C, the maximum
temperature reached in our experimental conditions (Figure S7a). In fact, the experimental H2 consumption
below 800 °C was significantly lower than the theoretical H2 required for the total Fe3+ to Fe2+ reduction (0.15 or 0.32 vs 2.06 mmol/g), indicating only a partial
reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+. This is in line with
the phase composition obtained by Rietveld analysis of the XRD patterns
after the TPR experiment (Figure S7b).
The reduction feature above 800 °C, corresponding to 2.04 mmol
H2/g, well accounted for the complete reduction to Fe2+ and for the beginning of Fe2+ to Fe0, with the theoretical H2 consumption Fe2+ to
Fe0 equal to 4.12 mmol/g (Table S1). Although TPR results confirmed high similarity of R053 with FeNit,
the same results pointed out to a slight effect of the waste iron
precursor on the reducibility of Fe3+ cations present in
the perovskite-type powder.

In Figure S8, the N2 adsorption/desorption
isotherms (a) and cumulative pore volume vs average pore size distribution
(b) for R053 and FeNit are displayed, respectively. Both the powders
had low porosity, typical of LaFeO3 calcined at 700 °C
with a type II form of adsorption/desorption isotherms,27 exhibiting a very small hysteresis only at high P/P0 pressure values (0.9–1.0),
likely due to the contribution of interparticle voids. The broad pore
size distribution curve and the very low pore volume registered (see Figure S8b and Table S2) suggest the presence
of few pores with not well-defined shape. With respect to the reference
sample prepared by iron nitrate (FeNit), a slightly larger Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
value was registered for R053, 14.5 vs 10.3 m2/g (Table S2).

Looking at Figure 6, FeNit and R053 showed almost
identical C3H6 conversion curves.

Figure 6 Conversion
curves for the propylene oxidation on the waste-derived
sample (blue squares, solid line) and the reference sample (black
circles, dashed line).

The reaction starts above 250 °C, 50% of propylene conversion
being reached at around 350 °C and full conversion at 500 °C.
In the entire range of temperature, for both catalysts, the oxidation
of C3H6 was complete to CO2 without
CO formation. The data reported so far is in agreement with similar
results reported in the literature for LaFeO3 perovskites
tested in the same reaction at the same space velocity.23 Apparently, the small enhancement in textural
and microstructural properties and in Fe3+ reducibility
observed for the waste-derived sample did not affect the propylene
oxidation.

Effect of the Waste Iron Precursor Amount
on the Properties
of the Waste-Derived Material
The waste iron content was
varied from 0.46 to 1.18 g. Its effect on the combustion process and
on the powder properties and catalytic performance was investigated
over this range.

For any waste iron content, the temperature–time
profile of the rust waste-derived samples resembled that of R053.
In Figure S9, the temperature/time profiles
of an iron-poor sample (R049) and an iron-rich sample (R118) are shown.
As for R053 (Figure S4), both the profiles
were characterized by a localized ignition of the gel mass, although
the temperature–time profile reported for R118 showed much
more attenuation of the combustion wave than that reported for R049
(Figure S9).

Figure 7 shows the
XRD patterns of a representative iron-poor sample (R046) and iron-rich
sample (R118) after different thermal treatments.

Figure 7 XRD patterns of R046,
a representative iron-poor waste-derived
sample (A, B), and of R118, a representative iron-rich waste-derived
sample (C, D) after calcination at 700 °C/5 h (A, C) and after
further thermal crystallization at 1000 °C/5 h (B, D). All of
the pictures were taken by the authors.

LaFeO3 perovskite phase was present in all of
the XRD
patterns. No secondary phases were visible in the iron-poor sample,
whereas Fe2O3 secondary phase was clearly visible
in the iron-rich sample. However, a further thermal treatment at 1000
°C/5 h evidenced the presence of a secondary phase also in the
iron-poor sample (Figure 7). This secondary phase was identified as a La-containing
compound that in the freshly calcined powder was La2O3, although it became La(OH)3 upon hydration by
air humidity when the powder was gently ground in an agate mortar
for 1 min. Table S3 contains all of the
structural and microstructural data obtained from the Rietveld analysis.
The type/amount of segregated phases was found to be clearly dependent
on the amount of waste iron used in the synthesis (e.g., by the Fe/La
ratio): La(OH)3 segregation decreased until waste iron
reached 0.53 and Fe2O3 segregation increased
for waste iron values from 0.54 to 1.18. This is better visualized
in Figure 8, showing
a volcano trend of the perovskite phase weight percentage in the samples
calcined at 1000 °C/5 h as a function of the amount of waste
iron used in the synthesis.

Figure 8 wt % perovskite phase after thermal treatment
at 1000 °C (with
standard deviation calculated from Rietveld refinement) as a function
of the waste iron amount. The white zone corresponds to the segregation
of the La-containing phase and the pink zone corresponds to the segregation
of the Fe-containing phase. Standard deviation is indicated in white
inside each square.

It is assumed that a
La-containing secondary phase was already
present as amorphous, although La2O3 or La(OH)3 was not detectable in the XRD patterns of the iron-poor sample
calcined at 700 °C.

Fe/La molar ratio determined by MP-AES
increased linearly from
0.87, for the iron-poor R046, to 2.24, for the iron-rich sample R118
(Figure 9).

Figure 9 Trend of the
Fe/La molar ratio with increasing waste iron content
for all of the rust waste-derived samples: Fe/La obtained from EDX
is indicated by black stars and yellow solid line; nominal Fe/La by
white squares and a black solid line; Fe/La obtained from MP-AES by
black squares and cyan solid line; Fe/La obtained from XPS by gray
squares and gray solid line. The corresponding Fe/La ratio of the
FeNit reference for each characterization technique is indicated by
horizontal dashed lines of the respective color.

This trend is in accordance with the amount of waste iron
precursor
and with the consequent lanthanum oxide or iron oxide segregation.
Similarly, the Fe/La ratio calculated by XPS measurements changed
with the waste iron content, but a Fe depletion (La enrichment) on
the surface was observed (Figure 9), as already noted for R053. Two oxygen components
were still visible in the oxygen O 1s spectra of the iron-poor and
iron-rich samples (Figure 10 and Table S4), as already noted
for R053.

Figure 10 O 1s XPS images of iron-poor (R046) and iron-rich (R118) rust waste-derived
powders calcined at 700 °C/5 h in comparison with R053, with
stoichiometric Fe/La molar ratio.

The variation of the relative percentage of these two components
and their position may be partially correlated with the formation
of segregated Fe2O3 (O 1s at ca. 530 eV) or
La2O3 (whose O 1s ranges between 528.5 and 530.5
eV28), in agreement with the XRD results
of Figure 7 and Table S3. Of course, this may affect the catalytic
properties of the powder. In fact, it has been found in the literature
that under-stoichiometric LaFeO3 perovskites on the A-site
have better catalytic oxidation performance due to the decrease of
La2O3 on the surface and correspondently higher
amount of catalytically active iron on the surface.23

In Figure 11a,
the TPR profiles of two representative waste-derived samples with
low and high waste iron content are presented in comparison with the
R053 sample.

Figure 11 (A) TPR profiles of the single-phase waste-derived sample
R053
in comparison with those of iron-poor (R046) and iron-rich (R118)
representative samples. (B) H2 consumption at T lower (black and white circles with black below) and higher (black
and white circles with black above) than 800 °C, and total H2 consumption (mmol/g) calculated from the integration of the
TPR curves as a function of the segregated Fe2O3.

With respect to R053, much more
intense reduction peaks were visible
in the TPR profile between 300 and 800 °C, with hydrogen consumption
ranging from 0.74 to 4.91 mmol/g (Figures 10b and 11a). Massive reduction at such low
temperatures observed for R118 (and for the other iron-rich samples)
was associated with the complete reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ as well as to the partial reduction of Fe2+ to
Fe0 in segregated Fe2O3.29,30 Effectively, the amount of hydrogen consumed below 800 °C increased
as the amount of segregated Fe2O3 detected by
XRD from R053 (no Fe2O3 segregated) to R118
(28 wt % Fe2O3 segregated) (Figure 11b). On the contrary, the amount
of hydrogen consumed above 800 °C remained more or less constant
(Figure 11b). It is
likely that, at low temperature, complete reduction of Fe2O3 occurs and the metallic iron formed may promote partial
reduction of the LaFeO3 (see also Figure S10 and relative comment). Such hypothesis was further confirmed
by the almost negligible reduction detected for R118 above 875 °C
(0.82 vs 2.04 mmol/g for FeNit). The presence of a discrete TPR peak
in the 100–800 °C range in the iron-poor R046 might be
related to the activation of H2 onto surface oxygen of
La2O3 particles forming La(OH)3.31 The possibility that the peaks in the 250–800
°C range were due to some Fe2O3 present
on the R046 surface can be ruled out, since XPS and MP-AES results
claim for R46 an under-stoichiometric Fe/La ratio. The difference
in redox behavior among the iron-poor and iron-rich samples might
partially affect as well their redox interaction with propylene.

Table S5 contains all of the textural
data for some of the waste-derived samples investigated. From the
analysis of data listed in Table S5, it
emerges that the morphological features of the prepared samples are
similar, without any significant effect played by the amount of waste
iron. The surface area values were about 14 m2/g and comparable
to or somehow higher than the values generally reported in the literature
for LaFeO3 perovskites,2,28,30,32 as already observed
for R053.

In Figure 12, SEM
images of an iron-poor powder (R046) are compared to those of an iron-rich
one (R118).

Figure 12 SEM images of iron-poor (electric blue box, A and C) and
iron-rich
(green box, B and D) rust waste-derived powders, calcined at 700 °C
(A, B) and 1000 °C (C, D).

Morphology was clearly different in the two samples, both
after
thermal treatment at 700 and 1000 °C. Roundish particles were
visible in the iron-poor powder, whereas in the iron-rich powder,
hexagonal particles were evident, particularly after thermal treatment
at 1000 °C. SEM image of R118 sample calcined at 700 °C
resembles very much the SEM image of the waste iron at the same enlargement
(Figures 2 and 12), whereas R046 (Figure 12A,C) has different morphology and slightly
smaller grains with respect to R118 (Figures 12A,C and 12B,D) and
R053 (Figures 4 (blue
box) and 12A,C), in agreement with the trend
in crystal size reported in Table S3. Interestingly,
after thermal treatment at 1000 °C, the grain size increased
only for R046, reaching approximately the same size of the grains
of R118 sample, suggesting a strong agglomeration of crystallites
for R118 calcined at 700 °C. Therefore, the microstructural and
morphological properties of LaFeO3 powders prepared from
waste iron precursor were strongly influenced by the amount of waste
iron.

Propylene conversion increased with the temperature for
all of
the investigated samples (Figure 13). The activity trend for LaFeO3 catalysts
was found to be in the following order: R080 ∼ R118 ∼
R054 ≫ R046 (Figure 13).

waste-derived
LaFeO3 samples: R046 (blue squares), R054 (cyan circles),
R080 (magenta triangles), and R118 (green rhombs). FeNit reference
sample is indicated by the black dashed line.

FeNit was also reported in Figure 13 as a reference. Its activity (as well as
the activity
of the single-phase R053 sample (Figure 6)) was almost comparable to that of the iron-rich
samples, and all performed better than the iron-poor sample (Figure 13), displaying temperatures
for 50 and 100% propylene conversions about 50 °C lower than
those over R046. The relatively low temperatures at which propylene
conversion occurred over the iron-rich samples suggests that the Fe2O3 detected as secondary phase can contribute to
the catalytic activity. These results indicate that the proposed synthetic
approach is quite successful even in the presence of consistent Fe2O3 impurities. On the other hand, the iron-poor
sample (R046) was less active in the propylene oxidation. According
to the work of Schön et al.,23 the
excess of La species on the surface of R046 might be highly responsible
for the decreased activity of this sample with respect to the FeNit
reference (Figure 13). Thinking of an industrial application, our results highlighted
that an excess of waste iron could be always considered a better choice
for obtaining optimized catalytic performance of LaFeO3-based catalysts, whereas a substoichiometric Fe/La ratio would be
deleterious. In addition, knowledge of the exact phase composition
of the waste-derived iron precursor would not be strictly required
under over-stoichiometric Fe/La ratio. This overcomes any drawback
connected with the intrinsic variability of rust waste and with the
determination of the exact amount of iron precursor needed for obtaining
a single-phase perovskite.

Conclusions
For
the first time, an economical, widespread and available waste
iron has been successfully recycled as an iron precursor to prepare
a LaFeO3 perovskite by solution combustion-based methodologies.
The iron-containing perovskite has been tested as a heterogeneous
catalyst for propylene oxidation, closing the circle of this sustainable
procedure.

On comparing with the commercial iron nitrate precursor,
the waste
iron is able to produce an iron perovskite with the same catalytic
activity. In addition, the waste iron affects the microstructural
properties of the perovskite powder, changing both particle size and
shape.

Two main limitations of the effectiveness of this recycling
procedure
have been identified, which may introduce a variability factor into
the final iron-containing perovskite powder composition: the intrinsic
variability of the rust waste from scrap iron and the need to carefully
determine the stoichiometric amount of rust waste by experimental
evaluation. However, it has been found that these limitations may
be partially overcome by using an excess of rust waste since the activity
of the iron-rich compositions does not change with the waste iron
content in a reasonably wide range (0.54–1.18 g).

The
proposed approach can be easily extended to the preparation
of doped LaFeO3 and other iron-containing compounds, enabling
the sustainable production of a variety of functional materials. Above
all, this work envisages the possibility to exploit insoluble waste
inorganic precursors directly for the synthesis of nanomaterials,
bypassing any time/solvent/acid-consuming extraction step. In addition,
our results encourage the application of this powerful methodology
to other insoluble waste metal precursors for the synthesis of perovskite-type
compounds with different compositions.

Experimental Section
Rust Waste
Collection and Pretreatment
Rust waste was
collected in powdered form from the transmission line tower manufacturing
unit of an industry near Nagpur, India (Figure 14).

Figure 14 Rust waste produced from scraping of the rusted
electricity transmission
towers of a manufacturing industry close to Nagpur (India). All of
the pictures were taken by the authors.

The as-received rust waste was washed in a stainless steel
beaker
with distilled water at about 90 °C for 1 h under manual stirring.
Then, the water was taken out of the beaker and replaced with clean
cold water. Washed rust waste was then dried overnight in an oven
at 80 °C. The obtained powder was magnetic and brown and was
called “waste iron”.

Synthesis of LaFeO3 Powders
The chemicals
used for the synthesis of the waste-derived powders were La(NO3)3·6H2O (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.999%),
C6H8O7 anhydrous (Alfa Aesar, >99.5%),
NH4NO3 (Sigma-Aldrich, 99.5%), NH4OH (Sigma-Aldrich, water solution, 28% vol), and the waste iron obtained
after the washing treatment. The reference sample was prepared by
using the same type of chemicals except for the waste iron precursor,
which was replaced by Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (Alfa Aesar Puratronic, 99.999%).

To prepare the waste-derived
samples, lanthanum nitrate, citric acid, ammonium nitrate, and selected
amounts of waste iron (Table 1) were weighed in required proportions and poured into a stainless
steel beaker. Then, 400 mL of distilled water was added and pH was
regulated at 6 by adding ammonia solution. The stainless steel beaker
containing all of the combustion ingredients was kept on a hot plate
with the vertex set at 80 °C, and the water was allowed to evaporate
by mechanical stirring until a gel was formed. After gel formation,
the vertex and the stirrer were removed and combustion was initiated
by heating the gel mass up to about 200 °C. The as-burned powders
produced after combustion were denoted by R (“R” = rust
waste) followed by three numbers, indicating the amount of waste iron
precursor used for the synthesis, without the dot and taking into
account just the two decimal numbers (i.e., if waste iron is 0.5305,
then the name of the sample is R053) (Table 1).

Table 1 Legend of the Samples
According to
the Amount of Waste Iron Precursor Used
For all of
the samples, the amount of lanthanum precursor was fixed
at 3.568 g of La(NO3)3·6H2O,
corresponding to a batch of 2 g of perovskite powder with a Fe/La
molar ratio of 1. Lanthanum nitrate is both a La source and a NO3– oxidant source. During the combustion
process, lanthanum nitrate was transformed into LaFeO3,
whereas NO3– was reduced by citric acid
(fuel) through a self-sustained redox reaction.

The citric acid-to-lanthanum
molar ratio was fixed to 1, whereas
the fuel-to-metal cations ratio (metal cations = La + Fe) oscillated
between 1.24 and 2.14, depending on the iron content.

The amount
of waste iron precursor was varied according to Table 1, producing powders
with different total Fe/La molar ratios. The purpose of this study
was to obtain the exact waste iron precursor amount needed for a pure
sample and to check the properties and performance of the samples
in the common case where the amount of the stoichiometric waste ion
precursor is not exactly known. The iron content in the rust waste-derived
samples was calculated “a posteriori” according to a
procedure described in the Supporting Information (p S17).

The reducers-to-oxidizers ratio (Φ) was set
at 1.9 by using
a selected amount of ammonium nitrate as additional oxidant, according
to the propellant chemistry calculations.20 The amount of NH4NO3 oxidant was the same
for all of the waste-derived samples, disregarding the amount of waste
iron used because it was calculated with respect to the amount of
citric acid and the amount of NO3– counterion
in the lanthanum precursor.

Over-stoichiometric Φ values
were chosen for safety reasons
in view of an industrial application, where due to the higher amount
of powder produced in a single batch, attenuated combustion is preferable.20

An identical procedure was used for the
preparation of the reference
sample, although commercial Fe(NO3)3·9H2O (FeNit, where Nit stands for “nitrate”) was
used as iron precursor. The amount of Fe(NO3)3·9H2O weighed for preparing the FeNit sample, with
a stoichiometric Fe/La, was 3.3284 g, which corresponded to the same
molar amount of La(NO3)3·6H2O. Due to the presence of NO3– counter
anions in the commercial iron precursor, the amount of additional
oxidant was lowered to maintain the Φ ratio at 1.9.

All
of the as-burned powders were then kept in the furnace in an
alumina crucible for calcination in static air at 700 °C for
5 h (10 °C/min) to get the final material. For characterization
purposes, a portion of the powder was further treated at 1000 °C
for another 5 h to allow complete crystallization of all of the phases.
The samples calcined at 1000 °C were called with the original
sample name followed by “_1000”. In Figure 15, the steps of the synthesis
procedure used are illustrated.

Figure 15 Scheme of the procedure adopted for the
synthesis of rust-derived
LaFeO3 powders. (*) A further thermal treatment at 1000
°C/5 h was also performed for characterization purposes. All
of the pictures were taken by the authors.

Characterization Techniques
Powder X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) patterns were taken on the waste iron, as-burned samples, and
calcined samples (700 °C/5 h and 1000 °C/5 h) using a Bruker-Siemens
D5000 X-ray powder diffractometer equipped with a Kristalloflex 760
X-ray generator and a curved graphite monochromator using Cu Kα
radiation (40 kV/30 mA). The 2θ step size was 0.03°, the
integration time was 3 s per step, and the 2θ scan ranged from
10 to 90°. Diffraction patterns were compared with ICSD Database33 and analyzed by Rietveld refinement using the
GSAS package.34,35

Fourier transform infrared
(FT-IR) spectroscopy measurements were made with a Thermo Nicolet,
Avatar 370 instrument in the 4000–400 cm–1 spectral range, with a resolution of 4 cm–1, using
a KBr beam splitter, DTGS Detector, and an HATR assembly for convenience
of measurement. Signal identification was done with the help of a
database for the identification of unknown compounds. About 2 mg of
solid sample was used.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
analyses were performed
with a VGMicrotech ESCA 3000Multilab, equipped with a dual Mg/Al anode.
The spectra were excited by the unmonochromatized Al Kα source
(1486.6 eV) run at 14 kV and 15 mA. The analyzer was operated in the
constant analyzer energy mode. For the individual peak energy regions,
a pass energy of 20 eV set across the hemispheres was used. The pressure
in the analysis chamber was in the range of 10–8 Torr during data collection. The constant charging of the samples
was removed by referencing all of the energies to La 3d5/2 at 842.1 eV, as internal standard. Analyses of the peaks were performed
with the software CasaXPS. Atomic concentrations were calculated from
peak intensity using the sensitivity factors provided with the software.
The binding energy values are quoted with a precision of ±0.15
eV, and the atomic percentage with a precision of ±10%.

The surface microstructure and morphology of LaFeO3 nanopowders
was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), using an FEI Quanta
200 ESEM microscope, operating at 20 kV on specimens upon which a
thin layer of gold had been evaporated. Energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
analyses were also performed during the SEM observation.

Elemental
analysis was performed by microwave plasma atomic emission
spectroscopy (MP-AES). The samples (ca. 30 mg) were dissolved in 2
mL of aqua regia and diluted to 10 mL with distilled water. The analyses
were made with an Agilent 4200 MP-AES.

Specific surface area
(the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
method)36 and pore size distributions (the
Barrett–Joyner–Halenda method)37 were evaluated by nitrogen adsorption/desorption measurements at
−196 °C, using ASAP 2020 Plus Materials. All of the samples
were pretreated under vacuum at 250 °C for 2 h prior to the measurements.

Reduction properties of the samples were studied by temperature-programmed
reduction (TPR) experiments by flowing H2/Ar (5%, 30 mL/min)
and increasing the temperature between 25 and 1020 °C (heating
rate, 10 °C/min). Experiments were carried out with a Micromeritics
Autochem 2910 instrument equipped with a thermal conductivity detector
(TCD). All powders (∼0.1 g) were pretreated in O2/He (5%, 30 mL/min) at 350 °C for 30 min and then cooled down
under He (30 mL/min), before starting TPR. The hydrogen consumption
was evaluated by integration of the reduction peaks and applying a
calibration curve. The values in terms of mmol of H2 consumed
per gram of sample are quoted with a precision of ±5%. To avoid
any interference in the hydrogen consumption evaluation by using TCD
analyzer, the water formed during the reduction process was removed
from the gas stream using a cold trap.

Activity tests for the
propylene oxidation were carried out in
a U-shaped quartz reactor operating under continuous flow at atmospheric
pressure. The reactor temperature was measured by a thermocouple placed
coaxially inside the reactor. The feeding was a gas mixture (50 mL/min)
having 2500 ppm of propylene and 15% O2 (balance He). Powder
(50 mg) was used for each run corresponding to a weight hourly space
velocity of 60 000 mL/(gh). Before the catalytic experiments,
the powder was manually crushed in an agate mortar to achieve the
same level of granulometry. The activity tests were carried out in
the 100–500 °C range with steps of 25 °C and waiting
30 min for each step to get steady-state conditions. The feed and
the effluent gases were analyzed using UV-IR ABB Analyzers to detect
CO and CO2 and a paramagnetic analyzer for O2. The propylene conversion was evaluated based on the detected CO
and CO2.
