The
spectroelectrochemical features of some recently synthesized
borepins have been predicted herein using the methods based on density
functional theory. The computed electronic spectra of neutral, radical
anion, and dianion species clearly suggest that these molecules can
be used as new electrochromic materials. The excellent agreement with
the available structural and absorption experimental data for the
neutral systems made us confident for the results obtained for charged
species and suggests their potential use as electrochromic materials.

1 Introduction
Electrochromism is a phenomenon related to reversible color change
in a material caused by an electrochemically induced oxidation–reduction
reaction.1−4 It results from the generation of different electronic absorption
bands on switching between redox states. Commonly, color changes occur
between a transparent state, in which the electrochromic material
absorbs only in the UV region, and a colored state as well as between
two colored states. If there are more than two redox states corresponding
to different absorption bands in the spectrum, it is said that the
material possesses multicolor electrochromism or it is named polyelectrochromic.
In practice, this color change is achieved by a small potential pulse
ranging from fractions of volts to few volts. When the pulse is removed,
the electrochromic material persists in its new colored state until
a reverse electric pulse is applied or a competitive reaction takes
place. Although the term “electrochromic” originates
from a color variation, now its meaning has been extended and it is
used to indicate a change of electronic absorption bands in any region
of the electromagnetic spectrum (visible, near-infrared,5,6 thermal infrared, and microwave7,8). These features
make electrochromic materials very interesting for commercial applications.
Among electrochromic devices, the so-called intelligent windows3,9−11 are in a prominent position. They allow us to control
the flow of light and heat, and they can be used for a variety of
applications where the transmission or reflection modulation effect
can be used significantly. For example, they can be used for the regulation
of incident solar energy and glare for improving the energy efficiency
of buildings, vehicles, aircraft, spacecraft, and ships. The electrochromic
materials utilized for this type of applications are those for which
one of the redox states corresponds to the total transmittance of
the solar radiation (bleached state). Instead, materials lacking a
transmissive state are useful for applications3,12−14 where different colors are desired in different redox
states.

Polyaromatic hydrocarbons have been the subject of intensive
investigations
due to their photophysical properties that allow multiple applications
as optoelectronic materials.15 These properties,
controlled by the energy of frontier molecular orbitals, can
be modulated by varying the size and shape or also incorporating noncarbon
main group atoms. For example, the introduction of electron-deficient
three-coordinate boron atoms causes a lowering of the lowest unoccupied
molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, making the materials, thus obtained,
suitable for n-type or ambipolar semiconductor applications.16,17 Although many studies on the synthesis and characterization of polyaromatic
hydrocarbons are present in the literature, those on the analogues
containing boron (borepins) have been carried out only in recent years.17−23 Borepin is an unsaturated seven-membered ring system with tricoordinate
boron, that, unlike other heteropins, in its neutral state has an
unoccupied p-orbital on boron that together with π and π*
orbitals of the heptatriene portion entails an aromatic planar structure.

Very recently, Wagner and co-workers have reported a facile route
to attain quadruply benzannulated nonplanar borepins with potential
applications as Lewis acid catalysts or optoelectronic materials (compounds a–c in Scheme 1).24 The nonplanarity
of such systems, recently reviewed by Messersmith and Tovar25 assessing the aromaticity of borepin rings,
helps also their solubility in the absence of solubilizing side chains.
Other new borepins containing polycyclic aromatic compounds have been
synthesized and characterized with the aim to promote borepin-centered
aromaticity.26 In this work, dibenzo[b]thiophene-fused borepins (d and e) with boron–mesityl groups that, differently from the other
borepins, entail planarity of the whole structure have been presented.

Scheme 1 Schematic Structures of the Investigated Borepins a–e
Besides the synthetic
procedure, that always remains a critical
challenge for large-scale application of a promising product,24−28 the modulation of the photophysical properties of compounds supposed
to be suitable for optoelectronic applications can be achieved a priori
by studying the properties that can help in enhancing their efficiency
as electrochromic materials, such as absorption spectra of the reduced
species and redox potentials. In this work, we report a theoretical
investigation performed at density functional (DFT) and its time-dependent
extension (TDDFT) levels of theory on some borepins (see Scheme 1) recently synthesized
and characterized24,26 that show some interesting electrochemical
properties. In an effort to help the understanding of their properties,
we found it interesting to theoretically predict electronic spectra
of the charged species of two different classes of borepins, characterized
by planar (molecules d and e) and nonplanar
structures (molecules a and c). Furthermore,
the spectra of the neutral species have also been described to compare
the obtained data with those came out from experiments24 and then to prove the reliability of the protocol
used for the reduced species not characterized before. The same level
of theory has been then used to simulate the redox potentials to find
the most suitable functional able to reproduce such a property.

2 Results and Discussion
As reported above, the two classes
of borepins studied here differ
in extension of π electrons that in the first case, molecules a–c, returns nonplanar systems, contrariwise
to the second one, compounds d and e, for
which the high aromatic character of the borepin ring makes the molecules
almost completely planar. The optimized structural parameters obtained
using three exchange and correlation functionals, which are B3LYP,
PBE0, and M06, are listed in Table S1 together
with the available X-ray data for system a.24

First, as expected, systems a–c are characterized by nonplanar structures
with the mesityl (2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)
group arranged orthogonally to the boron-containing plane, regardless
of the exchange and correlation functional used. The dihedral angle
C1–C2–C3–C4 (see labels in Scheme 1) assumes values of about 39° for a, in
very good agreement with the corresponding crystallographic counterpart
(38.9°). In compounds b and c, the
extension of the systems entails a slight reduction of such a dihedral
angle, returning values of 33 and 31°, respectively. It decreases
by about 2° in the radical anion species, labeled as a–, b–, and c–, and by
about 4° in the dianion one of compound c, labeled c2–. Also, the inspection of
bond lengths and valence angles in a confirms a good
agreement with the X-ray values.24 In all
of the systems, the addition of an electron causes only a small variation
in the bond distances that, as expected, become a little bit large
in the case of bicharged c2–. Similarly to compounds a–c, the mesityl group in d and e assumes
an orthogonal orientation with respect to the borepin plane. However,
due to the conjugation, dihedral angles φ and θ assume
values very close to the planarity in both neutral and anionic forms
(see Table S1).

The computed vertical
excitation energies for neutral and anionic
systems are reported in Table 1. The comparison between the calculated and the experimental
absorption spectra, possible only for the neutral molecules,24 supports the reliability of the used computational
tool. The average errors for B3LYP, M06, and PBE0 functionals in overestimation
of absorption bands are about 17, 7, and 3 nm, respectively, with
PBE0 that returns values closest to the experimental ones for the
first class of compounds. However, for compounds d and e, all of the exchange and correlation functionals essentially
underestimate the main absorption bands,26 with average errors of 16, 24, and 27 nm, respectively.

The
analysis of the excitation energies shows, as for the neutral
systems, that the S1 state is always originated by a HOMO
→ LUMO transition (over 90%) except for compound c, for which the transition occurs between HOMO – 2 and LUMO.
The orbitals’ composition and energy gaps are shown in Figure 1, from which emerges
that the HOMO–LUMO energy gap decreases in going from a to c with a more consistent reduction in c, whereas it is found to be the same for compounds d and e (3.70 eV), whose value falls between
those of compounds a and b. In compound c, the HOMO – 2 → LUMO gap represents the smallest
energy gap originating the first excited state, consistent with the
predicted excitation energies. Our computations confirm that the lowest
empty orbital is that of compound c, as previously underlined.24

The recorded cyclic voltammograms
clearly reveal a reversible redox
event at E1/2 (with respect to the FcH/FcH+ value of 4.8 eV) equal to −2.20, −2.38, −1.49,
−2.14, and −2.30 V for a–e, respectively.24,26 In addition, for system c, a second reversible reduction occurs at E1/2 = −1.84 V. We have computed these reduction
potentials, and the results (see Table 2) for all of the employed functionals are quite satisfactory,
with the M06 functional giving values closest to the experimental
counterparts24 with an average error of
about 0.13 V in underestimating the potential.

The first reduction process
leads to the formation of radical anion
species whose stability depends on the ability of the compound to
delocalize the unpaired electron on the whole system. Looking at the
spin density distributions reported in Figure 2, it can be noted that a part is localized
on the boron atom (which is an electron-deficient center), whereas
the rest is distributed on almost the whole molecular structure in
all of the investigated borepins. This behavior can also be seen considering
the maps of the molecular electrostatic potential, which allow us
to easily visualize what happens after electron addition. Figure 3 evidences how the
negative charge distribution (red region) involves almost the whole
structure in a, b, and c for
the first reduction. As already seen for the spin density distribution,
the same occurs for the second reduction of c.

borepins.

for neutral and charged
forms of all of the investigated borepins a–e. Electrostatic potentials have been obtained with a color
scale going from −0.14 (red) to 0.14 au (blue).

As it can be deduced from the data reported in Table 1, the monoreduced
systems show
very interesting absorption properties (see also Figure 4). All of the employed functionals
give the same trends and indicate that the presence of an extra electron
strongly red-shifts the two absorption bands of the neutral species.
The highest perturbation concerns the S1 excitation, which,
at the PBE0 level of theory, is red-shifted by 497 (a), 466 (b), and 495 (c) nm, while 229 and
325 are the shifts of the first band in the anionic form of d and e, respectively. As previously mentioned,
compound c exhibits a further reversible reduction at
−1.84 V. Under this potential, the absorption spectra must
also be affected and our theoretical results predict red shifts of
235 and 101 nm for the wavelengths associated with S1 and
S2, respectively. With respect to the first reduction,
the second bathochromic shift in c is less evident.

3 Conclusions
Density functional theory, employing
different exchange–correlation
functionals, has been used to predict the spectrochemical behavior
of three recently synthesized borepins. Results show that the computations
give results in good agreement with the experiments, regarding geometries,
absorption spectra of the neutral species and reduction potentials.
Computations on reduced forms predict interesting optical properties.
The monocharged species show a consistent red shift of the two main
absorption bands with S1 excitation falling in the near-infrared
region. Also, the doubly reduced species of system c undergoes
significant shifts in the red region of the spectrum, supporting its
possible use as electrochromic materials. We hope that our predictions
can stimulate experimental investigations on the spectrochemical properties
of other borepins to propose the optoelectronic materials of this
interesting class to be incorporated in electrochromic devices.

4 Computational Details
The electrochromic properties
of several molecular systems29−35 have been well computed using B3LYP,36,37 M06,38 and PBE039 exchange–correlation
functionals coupled with the 6-31G(d) basis sets as implemented in
the Gaussian 09 code.40 Also, for these
systems, we chose to use these functionals to evaluate whether the
influence of the amount of exact exchange, that is 20% for B3LYP,
25% for PBE0, and 27% for M06, could influence the electrochromic
properties. The molecular geometries have been optimized without symmetry
constraints, and the frequency calculations at the same level of theory
have been done to properly establish the nature of minima for the
structures found. Radical anions have been treated at the unrestricted
Kohn–Sham level, and no spin contamination has been found,
the ⟨S2⟩ value being equal
to 0.77. The electronic spectra of neutral and charged species have
been obtained employing the time-dependent density functional linear
response theory (TDDFT) considering the lowest twenty-five vertical
excitation energies on the geometries previously optimized at the
same level of theory and employing the 6-31+G(d) basis set. Solvent
effects, cyclohexane (ε = 2.02) for compounds a–c and chloroform (ε = 4.71) for d and e, have been evaluated using the nonequilibrium
implementation41 of the polarizable continuum
model.42 The choice of the medium has been
dictated by the presence in literature of the experimental spectra
for the neutral species.24,26

Redox potentials,
computed with respect to ferrocene (E(Fc+/Fc) = 4.63, 5.08, and 5.07 V at B3LYP/6-31G*, M06/6-31G*,
and PBE0/6-31G* levels of theory, respectively), have been obtained
following the Nernst equation43  where F is the Faraday constant, n is the number of electrons transferred in the reaction
and Δ(ΔGs)redox is the free energy change calculated on the basis of the Born–Haber
thermodynamic cycle as follows  where ΔGg is the change of standard Gibbs free energy for the reaction
in
gas phase and ΔGs(red) and ΔGs(ox) are standard solvation energies of reduced
and oxidized species, respectively, of the given redox reaction.
