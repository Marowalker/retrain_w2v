The glycolysis reaction of poly(bisphenol
A carbonate) (PC) has
been explored under 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) catalysis
as a potential route to valorize PC wastes by chemical recycling.
The amidine base is an active catalyst of PC glycolysis and, under
suitable conditions, promotes effectively and selectively the depolymerization
of the polymeric material with 1,2-propanediol or glycerol to give
the monomer bisphenol A (BPA) and the relevant cyclic carbonate. The
depolymerization process has been investigated under solventless conditions,
using diol/triol as the reagent and reaction medium, and also in an
auxiliary solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) that is able to dissolve
the polymer. The influence of a few experimental parameters (temperature,
catalyst load, and reaction time) on the selectivity to cyclic carbonate
has been studied. High selectivity to cyclic carbonate has been attained
by carrying out the depolymerization reaction in THF and using mild
temperature conditions and a stoichiometric amount of polyol. The
catalyst can be recovered from the reaction mixture as a BPA/DBU adduct
and effectively recycled in a successive run.

1 Introduction
Chemical
recycling of waste plastics is a useful strategy to reduce
the environmental and social impact of this typology of wastes. This
approach, which regards the waste as a potential resource rather than
a mere refuse, implies the chemical conversion of waste polymers into
valuable chemicals and provides not only a fascinating alternative
to more conventional technological solutions (landfill, mechanical
recycling, and energy recovery) but also a smart response to the current
worldwide need of recycling carbon and saving energy.1,2

Poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC; 1) is one of
the
most widely used thermoplastics whose market is in rapid expansion.
The rise in the utilization of PC calls for the development of after-use
treatments. Chemical recycling may be a suitable way of valorizing
waste PC.3,4 In recent years, besides pyrolytic approaches,3,4 great attention has been paid to those protocols implying the cleavage
of carbonate bond by hydrolysis,3−6 aminolysis,7 and alcoholysis.3,4,8−10 These methods
not only provide a potential route to the regeneration of the starting
monomer bisphenol A (BPA; 2), which can be reused to
produce new virgin PC, but can also allow the synthesis of chemicals
with the added value.3,4 In this paper, we have focused
on the glycolysis reaction (eq 1; Scheme 1). This reaction is a potential route to
recover BPA, and it also provides a synthetic entry into cyclic carbonates,
a class of compounds widely used as solvents or intermediates in chemical
synthesis. In principle, also the cyclic carbonate can be reused,
together with recovered BPA, to regenerate virgin PC. In fact, cyclic
carbonates, for a long time prepared from toxic phosgene or CO as
sources of the carbonyl group, nowadays can be more safely obtained
by the cycloaddition of CO2 to epoxides:11 this reaction is currently exploited at an industrial scale
for the synthesis of dimethyl carbonate, used as a co-monomer (together
with BPA) in the manufacture of PC.12

Han et al. studied the glycolysis of PC in ethylene glycol (EG)
in the absence of any catalyst.13 At 453
K, depolymerization proceeded slowly with low BPA yield (30%, after
6 h). At 493 K, the conversion of
the polymer into the monomer was practically quantitative in 85 min,
but, under the working conditions, the coproduced cyclic carbonate
decomposed fast with the evolution of CO2.

Scheme 1 PC Glycolysis
(Eq 1)
Inorganic bases, such as NaOH14 or also
Na2CO3,15 turned
out to be active catalysts of PC glycolysis and, at 453 K, under solvolytic
conditions, promoted the depolymerization of PC in EG14,15 or 1,2-propanediol (1,2-PD; 3a)15 to give a mixture of 2 and BPA mono- and bis-(hydroxyalkyl)-ethers.
In these processes, the cyclic carbonate 4 formed as
transient species as the used catalysts, under the working conditions,
promoted fast not only the decomposition of 4 by decarboxylation14 but also the reaction of 4 with 2 to give BPA mono- (5) and bis-hydroxyalkylation
(6) products (Scheme 2).14,15

Scheme 2 Hydroxyalkylation
of BPA (2) with Propylene Carbonate (4a): Formation of
Mono-Hydroxypropyl-BPA (MHP-BPA) and Bis-Hydroxypropyl-BPA
(BHP-BPA) Derivatives
The utilization of nonconventional heating techniques
such as microwave
irradiation did not improve the selectivity to cyclic carbonate.16,17 The success of reaction 1 depends (a) on the choice of a suitable
catalyst that, although being effective in catalyzing carbonate formation
(eq 1), should exhibit a poor tendency to promote both carbonate decomposition
and BPA hydroxyalkylation (Scheme 2) and also requires (b) the careful tuning of right
working conditions. To date, the isolation of cyclic carbonate from
reaction 1 has been described only in rare cases. Oku, using NaOH
or KOH as catalysts, first reported the synthesis of BPA and glycerol
carbonate (4b) from the reaction of PC and a stoichiometric
amount of glycerol (3b), at 373 K, in dioxane as the
auxiliary solvent.18 Alkali bases are relatively
cheap catalysts, but they cannot be recycled, are wasted at the end
of the process, may cause equipment corrosion, and generate environmental
problems. Recently, a more complex recyclable catalytic system based
on an ionic liquid (Bu4NCl) and ZnO nanoparticles was found
to be effective in promoting, at 373 K in tetrahydrofuran (THF), the
depolymerization of PC with diols (1,2-PD; 1,3-butanediol) or glycerol
to give the relevant cyclic carbonates besides 2. However,
the process required relatively long conversion times (7–14
h) as well as a strong excess (vs PC) of the used polyol.19 To date, the search for effective reusable catalytic
systems able to promote reaction 1 selectively under conditions more
appealing from a practical point of view is still a challenging task.
In this work, we have focused on an organocatalyst such as 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
(DBU). Elsewhere, we have shown that DBU can promote the carbonylation
of nucleophiles NuH with carbonic acid diesters (Scheme 3, eq 2):10,20−22 DBU can work both as a base, activating NuH through
the formation of the more nucleophilic anion Nu– (Scheme 3; base catalysis),22 and as a nucleophile capable of activating the
carbonate group through the formation of a N-carbonyl-substituted
ketene aminal (Scheme 3; nucleophilic catalysis),20−22 which can effectively transfer
the CO2R group to nucleophiles NuH such as N-heteroaromatics
(pyrrole) and even alcohols.20 This reactivity
has been recently exploited in a very recent study, wherein we have
shown that DBU is an effective selective catalyst of PC alcoholysis.10 Herein, we report on the activity of DBU as
the catalyst of reaction 1 and describe a few novel simple efficient
protocols for the glycolysis and glycerolysis of PC using the amidine
superbase as the recyclable catalyst.

2 Experimental Section
2.1 General
Methods and Materials
In
this study, pure PC pellets (3 mm length × 2 mm diameter) were
used as a model of waste PC. The used polycarbonate may contain or
not a chain terminator. Polycarbonate used in the experiments with
1,2-PD was from Aldrich (Mw ≈ 64 000
by gel permeation chromatography). Scheme S1 shows a sketch of the polymeric chain and highlights the nature
of the additive, 4-cumylphenol (4-CP), used as a chain terminator.23 The spectroscopic characterization [NMR and
Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR)] of this polymeric material has
been reported elsewhere.6 The molar ratio
of 4-CP/BPA in the used polymer was equal to 0.035, as determined
by NMR.6 Accordingly, the moles of BPA
units (nBPA°) and the moles of CO3 groups (nCO3) incorporated
in w(g) of PC feed have been calculated
by means of eqs S1 and S2, respectively.

Polycarbonate used in the glycerolysis experiments was from SABIC
(Mw ≈ 40 000 by GPC). Figures S1–S3 show, respectively, the 1H and 13C NMR and attenuated total reflection (ATR)–FTIR
spectra of the polymer. In this case, the moles of BPA (nBPA°) and CO3 groups (nCO3) present in w(g) of feed PC have been calculated according to eq S3.

Yields of 2 and 4 were calculated through eqs 3 and 4, respectively, 3   4  where nBPA and ncarbonate were, respectively,
the moles of 2 and 4 determined by GC or
isolated.

1,2-PD (3a) and glycerol (3b) were Fluka
and Aldrich products, respectively. THF and diethyl ether were previously
dried according to conventional methods (P2O5; Na/benzophenone)24 and stored under
N2. DBU (Aldrich) was used as received and manipulated
under an inert gas atmosphere to prevent any contamination from atmospheric
CO2 or moisture.

GC analyses were performed with
a HP 5890 Series II or a THERMO
Scientific TRACE 1310 gas-chromatograph (capillary column: Heliflex
AT-5, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness). GC–(mass
spectrometry) MS analyses were carried out with Shimadzu GC-17A linked
to a Shimadzu GC-MS QP5050 selective mass detector (capillary column:
Supelco MDN-5S, 30 m × 0.25 mm, 0.25 μm film thickness).
IR spectra were recorded on a Shimadzu FTIR Prestige 21 spectrophotometer
or a PerkinElmer Frontier MIR/FIR spectrophotometer equipped with
a Pike GladiATR (diamond crystal) accessory. NMR spectra were recorded
with a Varian Inova 400 spectrometer or with an Agilent 500 instrument.
Chemical shifts are in δ (ppm) versus tetramethylsilane.

2.2 PC Glycolysis with 1,2-PD under Solvolytic
Conditions: General Procedure
The glycolysis reaction was
carried out in a ∼40 mL Schlenk tube equipped with a Sovirel
screw cap and Torion stopcock. The polycarbonate was suspended in
the diol under an inert gas (N2) stream, and the catalyst
was added. The reactor, once charged with the reactants, was sealed
and dipped into an electrically heated silicon oil bath, and the suspension
was stirred at the working temperature until complete depolymerization
of PC (disappearance of the PC pellets). The reaction mixture was
cooled to room temperature, diluted with THF, and analyzed by FTIR,
GC–MS, and GC using n-dodecane as the internal
standard.

In a few experiments, heating was prolonged until
the full consumption of propylene carbonate (4a) initially
formed (see, later, Table 4). BPA, as well as MHP-BPA and BHP-BPA species formed by the
reaction of 2 with 4a (Scheme 2), was separated by chromatography
as reported hereafter. The reaction mixture, cooled to room temperature,
was treated with distilled H2O and then extracted with
diethyl ether. The organic phase was dried over MgSO4 and
fractionated on a silica gel column using, as eluent, petroleum ether/diethyl
ether 1:1 (v/v) until elution of 4-CP and BPA and then petroleum ether/diethyl
ether 1:2 (v/v) until elution of the mixture of MHP-BPA derivatives
(5a′ and 5a″). Afterward,
the composition of the mobile phase was progressively enriched in
diethyl ether [petroleum ether/diethyl ether: 1:3 (v/v) → 1:5
(v/v) → 0:1 (v/v)] until elution of the mixture of BHP-BPA
isomers (6a′–6a‴). The NMR characterization
of the mixture of MHP-BPA derivatives (5a) as well as
the mixture of BHP-BPA isomers (6a) has been reported
in the Supporting Information (Figures S4–S7).

2.3 PC Glycolysis with 1,2-PD in THF: General
Procedure
The glycolysis reaction was carried out in a suitable
glass reactor analogous to that described above. The reactor, once
charged with the reactants and the catalyst, was sealed, and the reaction
mixture, containing also n-dodecane (internal standard)
if used, was stirred at the working temperature. The progress of the
reaction was monitored by measuring the formation of 4a over time by GC. The complete conversion of the polymer was further
confirmed spectroscopically by observing the disappearance of the
FTIR absorption of the polycarbonate at 1778 cm–1. The products can be separated by column chromatography. Herein,
we report the details of one of these experiments. To a THF (5 mL)
solution of PC (0.512 g), 1,2-PD (150 μL) and DBU (30 μL;
10 mol % vs nCO3) were added.
The reaction mixture was reacted at 373 K for 2.5 h and, then, analyzed
by GC (4a yield: ≥99%). Both 4a and 2 were separated with high yield (91 and 94%, respectively)
on a silica gel column using, as eluents, CHCl3 and, after
elution of 4a, diethyl ether.

2.3.1 Catalyst
Recovery and Recycling
The catalyst can be recovered through
a procedure analogous to that
described in ref (10). At the end of the catalytic run, the solvent (THF) was evaporated
in vacuum. The residue was washed with diethyl ether. The ethereal
phase, after addition of n-dodecane, was analyzed
by GC. The material insoluble in diethyl ether was dried in vacuum
and characterized by 1H NMR (Figure S8) as a BPA/DBU adduct.10 In accordance
with the outcomes of our previous studies on DBU-promoted PC alcoholysis,10 the BPA/DBU ratio was found to be equal to 2.5:1
mol/mol as established by means of the 1H integral spectrum.
The recovered adduct, once dissolved in THF and after addition of
fresh PC and the diol, was reusable in a new run.

2.4 PC Glycerolysis under Solvolytic Conditions:
General Procedure
The experimental apparatus was similar
to that described for solventless glycolysis experiments (see 2.2). To the suspension of PC in the triol, the catalyst
was added under a N2 stream. The glass reactor was sealed,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at the working temperature until
complete PC depolymerization (disappearance of the PC pellets). The
reaction mixture was cooled to ambient temperature, analyzed qualitatively
by FTIR and GC–MS, treated with H2O, and extracted
several times with diethyl ether. The resulting ethereal solution
was dried over MgSO4 and, after addition of n-dodecane (internal standard), analyzed by GC for the quantitation
of 2. BPA was also isolated by chromatography on a silica
gel column using, as eluent, a petroleum ether/ethyl acetate gradient
[from 6:1 to 2:1(v/v)].

2.5 PC Glycerolysis in THF:
General Procedure
Into a suitable glass reactor (see 2.3),
containing the THF solution of the polymer, glycerol, the catalyst,
and n-hexadecane (internal standard), if used, were
introduced under a N2 stream. The glass reactor was sealed,
and the reaction mixture was stirred at the working temperature. The
progress of the reaction was monitored by measuring the formation
of 4b over time by GC. The quantitative conversion of
the polymer was further confirmed spectroscopically by observing the
disappearance of the FTIR absorption of the polycarbonate at 1778
cm–1. The products can be separated by column chromatography.
Herein, we report the details of one of these experiments. To the
THF (5 mL) solution of PC (0.517 g), glycerol (150 μL) and DBU
(15 μL; 5 mol % vs nCO3) were added. The reaction mixture was reacted at 333 K for 3 h and
cooled to room temperature. After addition of CH3COOH (6
μL), the solution was evaporated in vacuum, and the residue
was fractionated on a silica gel column, first with petroleum ether/ethyl
acetate 9:1 (v/v), afterward with a mobile phase progressively enriched
in ethyl acetate until elution of BPA (94% yield), and, finally, with
only ethyl acetate until elution of 4b (90% yield).

3 Results and Discussion
3.1 DBU-Promoted
Glycolysis of PC with 1,2-PD
In this work, 1,2-PD (3a) was selected as the reference
diol. The glycolysis reaction was preliminarily investigated in the
absence of any catalyst, under solvolytic conditions, using diol as
the reactant and reaction medium (Table 1). At 453 K (1,2-PD/PC ≈ 12 m/m),
the depolymerization of 1 proceeded heterogeneously because
the polymer was poorly soluble in 3a under the working
conditions. The reaction was stopped after ∼2 h (entry 1, Table 1), when depolymerization
was quantitative (i.e., disappearance of the polymer pellets) and
a homogeneous system was obtained. Both 2 and 4a were obtained in high yield (95 and 94%, respectively). However,
prolonging the reaction time caused a sensible diminution of both 2 and 4a yield (81 and 78%, respectively; entry
2, Table 1) because
of side formation of MHP-BPA and BHP-BPA derivatives, as well as other
species, identified by GC–MS, such as 1-[4-(2-phenylpropan-2-yl)phenoxy]propan-2-ol
(the 2-hydroxypropylether of 4-CP; 270 m/z) and PhOH, 4-isopropenylphenol (4-IPP) and 4-isopropylphenol
(4-IPPH), which are products of thermal decomposition of BPA.25

b GC yield.

DBU is an active
catalyst of PC glycolysis in 1,2-PD. In the presence
of the amidine base, the depolymerization of 1 was markedly
faster and, using a catalyst load as high as 10 mol % (molDBU/molCO3), was complete in 5 min (Table 2 and Figure 1). The reacting system remained heterogeneous
throughout the reaction time, that is, until complete disappearance
of the PC pellets. The FTIR analysis of the reaction mixture (diluted
in THF) showed the disappearance of the band of PC at 1778 cm–1 and the appearance of the new absorption at 1809
cm–1 assigned to 4a (Figure 2): the FTIR spectrum does not
show any other carbonyl absorption at lower wavenumbers excluding,
thus, the presence in the reaction mixture of significant amounts
of soluble oligomers or hydroxyalkyl-aryl-carbonate species. This
suggests that the latter species, once formed, react fast to give
the final products.

b Reaction time: at that time, the
depolymerization of PC was quantitative (100%; disappearance of the
PC pellets).

c BPA was isolated
with 82% yield:
at the end of the catalytic run, the reaction mixture was partitioned
between diethyl ether and distilled H2O. The ethereal phase
was dried over MgSO4 and fractionated on a silica gel column
with petroleum ether/diethyl ether 1:1 (v/v) until elution of 4-CP
(87%) and, afterward, petroleum ether/diethyl ether 1:2 (v/v) until
elution of BPA.

The use
of lower catalyst loads caused the lengthening of the depolymerization
time. However, even by reducing the DBU load to 1 mol %, the increase
of depolymerization time was contained within more than acceptable
limits (23 min, at 453 K). The selectivity to carbonate 4a, measured when the depolymerization of 1 was complete,
was lower than in the absence of the catalyst (in Table 2, entries 1–3 compared
with entry 4), despite the fact that in the presence of DBU the reaction
times were markedly shorter. This suggests that DBU may promote, in
some degree, the further conversion of 4a. However, the
high selectivity observed (≥84%; entries 1–3, Table 2) indicates that 4a is quite stable under the working conditions and reacts
with BPA only to a moderate extent to give MHP-BPA and BHP-BPA derivatives
(Scheme 2).

As
expected, the use of less severe reaction temperatures caused
a significant slowdown of the depolymerization process (Table 3, Figure 3). The selectivity to 4a, measured
when PC depolymerization was quantitative, tends to decrease, albeit
slowly, on lowering temperature (Table 3). This effect was more evident at the lowest temperatures
investigated at which the time required for the full depolymerization
of 1 was markedly longer.

b Reaction time: at that time, the
depolymerization of PC was quantitative (disappearance of the PC pellets).

Prolonging heating after the
complete depolymerization of 1 caused the quantitative
conversion of 4a within
times that increased with decreasing either temperature or the catalyst
load (Table 4). The disappearance of 4a was accompanied
by the significant formation of MHP-BPA and BHP-BPA derivatives (Scheme 2), and minor amounts
of other species, a few of which have been identified by GC–MS
[PhOH (94 m/z); 1,1′-oxydipropan-2-ol
and 2-(2-hydroxypropoxy)-1-propanol (134 m/z); 4-IPPH (136 m/z);
4-IPP (134 m/z); 1-phenoxypropan-2-ol

(270 m/z); and 1-(4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)phenoxy)propan-2-ol
(192 m/z)]. As an example, at 453
K, in the presence of 5 mol % of DBU, the quantitative depolymerization
of 1 (1.009 g) in 1,2-PD (10 mL) required a time as long
as 9 min (entry 3, Table 4). Prolonging heating for additional 5 h caused the complete
conversion of 4a and afforded MHP-BPA (5a′ and 5a″) and BHP-BPA (6a′–6a‴) products, which were isolated (see 2.2 and Figures S4–S7), together with unconverted
BPA, by column chromatography (isolated yields: BPA, 38%; MHP-BPA,
40%; BHP-BPA, 13%).

b At that time, the depolymerization

c Overall reaction time (i.e., until
the complete conversion of 4a).

As a whole, the above results show that DBU allows
to control the
selectivity to cyclic carbonate much better than alkali catalysts,
such as Na2CO3 or NaOH, do.14,15 In principle, this aspect of the catalytic activity of DBU can be
exploited to improve the selectivity to 4a by suitably
modifying the depolymerization conditions. Accordingly, much better
selectivities to 4a have been achieved by carrying out
the depolymerization process in an auxiliary solvent, such as THF
(that dissolves 1 easily), applying milder temperature
conditions and using the diol in stoichiometric amount versus PC (mol1,2-PD/molCO3 ≈ 1).

Figure 4 summarizes
the results obtained at different temperatures (≤373 K) when
the polymer (∼0.200 g) was reacted with 3a in
THF (2 mL) in the presence of 10 mol % DBU. The progress of the process
was monitored by following the formation of 4a over time.
The depolymerization reaction 1 proceeded smoothly even at ambient
temperature (300 K). After 22 h, 4a formed in 96% yield.
Markedly, shorter reaction times were observed at moderately higher
temperatures. At 373 K, the depolymerization of 1 was
quantitative in little more than 2.5 h with a carbonate yield as high
as 99%. Both 4a and 2 were isolated with
high yield (>90%) by column chromatography (see 2.3).

Figure 4 PC (∼0.200 g) depolymerization with 1,2-PD (mol1,2-PD/molCO3 ≈ 1) in THF (2 mL) in the presence
of DBU (∼10 mol %) at different temperatures.

The catalyst can be recovered from the reaction
mixture as a BPA/DBU
adduct,10 as described in 2.3.1. Figure S8 shows
the 1H NMR spectrum of the adduct. The BPA/DBU molar ratio
was found to be equal to 2.5:1.10 The adduct,
once isolated, can be readily reused in a successive run. Even after
5 cycles, both the productivity and selectivity of the process were
maintained very high (Figure 5) in accordance with the fact that the catalyst recovered
from the last run exhibited spectroscopic features (Figure S9) analogous to those of the catalyst recovered after
a single cycle.

Figure 5 Catalyst recycling: PC, ∼0.500 g; 1,2-PD, 145 μL;
DBU (used in cycle 1), 30 μL (∼10 mol %); THF, 5 mL;
373 K; 2.5 h. After each run, the catalyst was recovered as the BPA/DBU
adduct (2.5:1 mol/mol) and reused in the successive cycle. GC yields
were determined after the separation of the adduct. This explains
why the BPA yield after the first cycle was sensibly lower (∼75%)
than in the successive cycles.

3.2 DBU-Promoted Glycerolysis of PC
The
study has been extended to an industrially relevant triol such as
glycerol (3b). No reaction was observed when a suspension
of PC (0.195 g) in 3b (2.491 g) was stirred for 5 h at
453 K in the absence of any catalyst: the polymer was quantitatively
recovered by filtration. Therefore, in the absence of any catalyst,
the behavior of the polymer in glycerol differs slightly from that
displayed in EG13 or 1,2-PD (see 3.1): according to the mechanism proposed by Han,13 the very poor reactivity shown by 1 in neat glycerol may reflect, most probably, the greater difficulty
of the triol molecules in penetrating into the solid particles of
the polymer.

However, the addition of a catalytic amount of
DBU (10 mol %) caused a drastic change of reactivity and, under solventless
conditions (3b, 2.500 g), promoted the fast depolymerization
of 1 (0.200 g). Because of the poor solubility of 1 in glycerol, also, in this case, the reaction mixture remained
heterogeneous throughout the reaction time, until the disappearance
of the pellets. The depolymerization was complete in only 26 min.
Nevertheless, under the above conditions, 4b was obtained
in a negligible amount. The GC–MS analysis showed the formation
of BPA as the major product together with other species, among which
we have identified minor amounts of PhOH, 4-IPP, and BPA hydroxyalkylation
products. Use of a less severe temperature (423 K; PC, 0.202 g; glycerol,
2.563 g; DBU, 10 mol %) caused the prolongation of the depolymerization
time (disappearance of the PC pellets after 168 min) but did not improve
the selectivity to 4b. The analysis (FTIR, GC–MS)
of the reaction solution, once the depolymerization was complete,
showed, in addition to BPA, the formation of minor amounts of glycerol
carbonate (no other IR absorptions were noted in the carbonyl region;
see also 3.1), which disappeared on prolonging
the heating at the working temperature (423 K) for further 30 min.
The monomer 2 can be extracted from the reaction mixture
with diethyl ether (GC yield: 90%) and was isolated (yield: 84%) by
chromatography on a silica gel column (see Experimental
Section). According to the above results, DBU behaves differently
from KOH, which under comparable solventless conditions (10 mol %;
423 K, 1 h) did not show any catalytic activity.18

Most likely, the very low selectivity to 4b was due
to the modest stability of glycerol carbonate under the used conditions.
The glycerolysis of 1 has been, therefore, investigated
in THF, at milder temperatures, using a stoichiometric amount of the
triol.

Figure 6 shows that,
at 373 K, using a catalyst load ≥5 mol %, the quantitative
depolymerization of 1 (∼0.20 g) in THF (2 mL)
required a very short time (<1 h): moreover, a sensible increase
of selectivity (90 → 96%) can be observed on decreasing the
DBU load. With a catalyst load as low as 1 mol %, the formation of
the cyclic carbonate was even more selective (∼99%), but the
depolymerization process was slower and complete within 3.5 h.

loads.

The glycerolysis reaction proceeds
quantitatively and selectively,
within times acceptable from the applicative point of view, even at
temperatures significantly lower than 373 K (Figure 7). At ambient temperature (293 K), with a
10 mol % DBU load, a carbonate yield close to 95% was achieved within
22 h. A comparable yield (97%) was obtained at 333 K after only 2.5
h by using an even lower catalyst load (5 mol %).

Also, in this case, the products
(BPA and glycerol carbonate) were
separated with high yield (≥90%) by chromatography, as described
in 2.5.

4 Conclusions
In conclusion,
under suitable conditions, DBU behaves as an active
organocatalyst of PC glycolysis and promotes effectively and selectively
the conversion of 1 with 1,2-PD or glycerol to give the
monomer (BPA) and the relevant cyclic carbonate 4a or 4b, respectively.

The depolymerization process can be carried out under solventless conditions (using diol/triol
as the reagent and reaction medium) quantitatively with selectivity
to carbonate (4a or 4b), which depends on
the used polyol (3a or 3b), temperature,
catalyst load, and reaction time.

Very high selectivities to
cyclic carbonate have been obtained
by carrying out the depolymerization reaction in a cosolvent, such
as THF, wherein the polymer is soluble, and using mild temperature
conditions and a stoichiometric amount of polyol.

The depolymerization
process does not require any complex apparatus
and is simple from the operational point of view. The use of DBU as
the catalyst of the process allows to conjugate high productivity
with effective catalyst recyclability. Both BPA and the cyclic carbonates 4a or 4b have been isolated, at a laboratory
scale, in high yield. The above features, while marking positively
the described protocols, also provide a suitable starting point for
challenging scale up, and, as a whole, make these processes attractive
routes to chemical recycling and valorization of the waste polymer.
