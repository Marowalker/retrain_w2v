We
report new calculations, which include the influence of the
band gap and exciton states, of the electron inelastic mean free path
(IMFP) for liquid water, LiF, CaF2, and Al2O3 from the band gap to 433 keV. Among compounds, liquid water
is the most studied due to its role in radiobiological research, whereas
LiF and CaF2 are the most widely used thermoluminescent
dosimeters in environmental monitoring and medical and space dosimetry.
Due to its sensitivity, the optically stimulated luminescent dosimeter,
Al2O3, has recently begun to be used for personnel
monitoring. Previous treatments have modified the integration domain
to consider the indistinguishability between the incident electron
and the ejected one or the bandgap energy for nonconductors but not
to accommodate exciton states within the band gap, and no published
IMFP data are available for CaF2. Our calculation was carried
out using an electron-beam–solid-state interaction model through
the relativistic full Penn algorithm. Integration limits that consider
the band gap, the valence band width, and exciton interactions have
been used. The results suggest that, at electron energies below 100
eV, the different choices of models for integration limits and the
exciton interaction can affect the IMFP by 9–29%. At higher
energies, the differences associated with the choice of energy-loss
function and other input parameters are around 2.5–7.5%.

1 Introduction
Radiation dosimetry studies
the energy deposited (absorbed dose
is the energy deposited divided by the mass) in a given medium through
elastic and inelastic collisions between charged particles (ions and/or
electrons) and the medium. As a consequence of collisions, low-energy
secondary-electron (SE) cascades are generated. The SEs are considered
the main agent of radiation damage or other radiation effects in the
medium.1 The absorbed dose deposited by
photons is mainly due to “primary electrons” released
during the interaction. These in turn generate low-energy SE cascades
along their paths.2−4 However, the quantification of these SEs is challenging
due, in part, to the scarcity of consensus data for electron inelastic-scattering
cross sections in the sub-keV energy range,5−11 especially for insulators including those used as dosimetric materials.5 Emfietzoglou and colleagues have reported several
groups of data for electron cross sections in liquid water for energies
down to 10 eV,9 50 eV,10 and 100 eV,6 which are used
in the GEANT Monte Carlo (MC) code. At energies below 200 eV, these
studies show remarkable differences between the cross-section results
obtained using different approaches.6,7,11,12 PENELOPE8 offers the possibility of simulating sub-keV
electron transport in materials other than liquid water, including
compounds. However, it does not simulate electron trajectories until
full stopping, and it neglects the aggregation effects that are important
for low-energy electron interactions in condensed matter by rescaling
the mean free paths to the mass density of the medium and by using
interaction cross sections based on isolated atoms.12

Similar to dosimetry, a precise knowledge of SE yields
is of great
importance in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Thus, a MC code
called Java Monte-Carlo Simulator for Secondary Electrons (JMONSEL),
which is based on an electron-beam–solid-state-interaction
model, has been developed at the National Institute of Technology
(NIST) to produce SE yield versus beam position (image) for a given
sample shape and composition.13 JMONSEL
has been used to interpret data for SEM dimensional measurements13,14 and achieved subnanometer level agreement with measurements made
with transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering.14

The electron inelastic mean free path
(IMFP), defined as the mean
distance traveled by a charged particle between consecutive inelastic
collisions within the medium, is inversely related to the electron
inelastic-scattering cross section. A precise knowledge of IMFP for
electrons with energies below 1 keV is of great importance in radiation
dosimetry and SEM. In the 1970s, Powell15 introduced the idea of using experimental optical data (i.e., zero
momentum transfer, q = 0) to calculate the IMFP.
Later, Penn16 proposed a method based on
dielectric-function theory to compute IMFPs for materials that have
a known optical dielectric function, ϵ(q =
0, ω). The Penn method considers the inelastic scattering probability
dependence on the energy loss and momentum transfer through the use
of experimental optical data and the theoretical Lindhard dielectric
function.16,17 The method has two different approaches:
(i) the full Penn algorithm (FPA), which considers the extension of
the optical data to nonzero momentum transfer (q ≠
0) and requires triple integrations: over q, the
plasmon energy (ωp), and the energy loss (ω);16 and (ii) the simple Penn approximation (SPA)
in which the Lindhard dielectric function is replaced by a one-pole
approximation. For electrons with kinetic energies greater than or
equal to 200 eV, the SPA has been found to be equivalent to FPA to
within 3% for IMFP calculations.16 At lower
energies (down to 50 eV), the FPA is considered more reliable. IMFP
calculations have been made for a variety of elemental solids16−18 and some compounds.19−21 A robust and useful Tanuma–Powell–Penn
formula (TPP-2M) for predicting electron IMFPs based on the application
of the FPA has been proposed.20 Thereafter,
calculations were made for 41 elemental solids using a combination
of FPA at energies below 300 eV and SPA at greater energies.22 Recently, FPA in its relativistic version has
been used to calculate electron IMFPs for liquid water23 in the 50 eV to 30 keV energy range and for
41 elemental solids24 and 42 inorganic
compounds25 over the 50 eV to 200 keV energy
range. Independently, other methods have been proposed to calculate
IMFPs in solids,26 insulators such as alkali
halides and metal oxides,27,28 or organic compounds.29 These methods are based on a combination of
the dielectric theory to treat the interactions with the valence-band
electrons and the classical binary-encounter approximation for the
electron–core interaction27,28 and extended
to account for exchange effects29 or on
the employment of atomic/molecular inelastic cross sections derived
by semiempirical quantum mechanical methods.26 All of these studies present significant differences with respect
to data reported by Tanuma and colleagues30 at electron energies below 200 eV.

Among compounds, liquid
water is the most studied due to its role
in radiobiological research.6,7,9−11,23,31−33 However, at energies below 100 eV, the IMFP results
vary considerably from one research group to another. On the other
hand, LiF and CaF2 are among the many types of thermoluminescent
detectors available and the most widely used dosimeters in environmental
monitoring and routine personal, medical, and space dosimetry. Nonetheless,
electronic IMFP data at low energy for these compounds are scarce.
The first IMFP data for LiF were published by Tanuma et al.19 in the energy range from 50 eV to 2 keV. They
concluded that the TPP-2M formula is a more reliable method for calculating
IMFPs in this compound than the direct dielectric model34 due to the large errors in the energy-loss function
(ELF) data (defined in section 2), as judged by f-sum and KK-sum errors (see section 3.2) of −5 and −30%, respectively. For this reason,
LiF is omitted in their recent study.25 Later, Boutboul and collaborators28 investigated
the IMFP for LiF at energies ranging between 50 eV and 10 keV using
for insulators a generalized dielectric formalism that takes into
account the energy gap. Similar to liquid water, agreement was found
with those reported by Tanuma et al.19 at
energies greater than 200 eV.28 With respect
to CaF2, to the best of our knowledge, there exist no IMFP
data at low energies. Due to its high sensitivity, the optically stimulated
luminescent dosimeter, Al2O3, has recently begun
replacing LiF for personnel monitoring. Shinotsuka and collaborators
have reported the most complete IMFP data for Al2O3 in the energy range between 50 eV and 200 keV25 and in smaller scales are those published in
ref (26) for energies
ranging from 20 eV to 2 keV and ref (27) at energies between 50 eV and 10 keV.

It is well known that the integration domain has an important impact
on the IMFP calculation, mainly in the lower energy interval. For
the data reported in the literature, the integration limit has been
treated by several groups differently6,25,27,28,31−33,35 depending on whether
the medium of interest is a metal, semiconductor, or insulator. For
nonconductors, some have used an approximation based on the indistinguishability
of the electrons,6,31,33 while others consider the effect or not of the bandgap energy.25,27,28 Therefore, besides the difference
on the dispersion relations for the ELF, the variety of integration
methods might possibly influence the remarkable divergence observed
between the IMFP results reported in the literature for low-energy
electrons.

Thus, as done for the JMONSEL code, in this work,
the relativistic
full Penn algorithm (FPA) has been used to determine IMFPs for liquid
water, LiF, CaF2, and Al2O3 from
433 keV down to the energy gap. In particular, we used an integration
domain that considers the band gap, the valence band width, and exciton
interactions. The calculation for Al2O3 is used
as a benchmark for comparison to data recently published by Shinotsuka
and collaborators25 as the most complete
IMFP results available where the bandgap energy has been considered.

2 Calculation Method
Modern treatments of inelastic electron
scattering generally begin
with the following expression derived from ref (36) for the differential inverse
mean free path, λ–1: 1  or with an expression for
the cross section related to this one via λ–1 = Nσ , where N is the number
density of scatterers. In eq 1, ω and q are the energy and momentum
transfer, respectively, v is the incident electron’s
speed, and ϵ(q, ω) is the momentum and
energy-dependent dielectric function. Im[ – 1/ϵ(q, ω)] is the energy-loss function (ELF). Equation 1 is expressed in
Hartree atomic units, wherein the electron mass and charge, the reduced
Planck constant, and the electric constant satisfy me = e = ℏ = 4πε0 = 1. The dielectric function, ϵ(q,
ω), is derived for nonzero q by an extension
algorithm from the optical dielectric function, ϵ(0, ω),
data for which is available for many elements and some compounds by
measurement or calculation. Extension algorithms differ. For the results
of this paper, we use Penn’s (FPA) integral expansion of the
energy-loss function in terms of Lindhard energy-loss functions.16 We followed the relativistic implementation
of Shinotsuka, Tanuma, Powell, and Penn (STPP),24,25 who retain the longitudinal part of the relativistic cross section
and omit the transverse part, an approximation that should be good
for electron energies below 0.5 MeV.8

Equation 1 must be
integrated over allowed values of ω and q to
determine the IMFP. In their studies for insulators,6,31,33 the authors have used an integration
limit based on the indistinguishability between the incident electron
and the struck one in a high energy approximation. Thus, the integration
limit has been defined as the sum of the energy of the incident electron
(T) and the binding energy (B) divided
by 2, that is, (T + B)/2.6,33 However, the obtained IMFP values have been shown to be very sensitive
to the integration limit at energies below 100 eV.6 Besides, comparing with experimental data for liquid water,
overestimation of the IMFP has been observed at an energy below 40
eV.33 Thus, a higher-order correction (T′ = T + 2Bi; where Bi is the threshold energy for
each excitation) has been applied in order to improve this integration
limit by considering an extra kinetic energy received by the electron
when it interacts with the atomic potential of the medium.33 This was not considered as a rigorous correction,
and exploration of other ideas has been suggested. In contrast to
the high energy approximation used in the studies mentioned above,
with STPP, we use the method for nonconductors of Boutboul et al.,28 in which there is an energy change of Eg (the band-gap width) at the valence band edge
with no corresponding change in momentum. Within this approach, the
upper integration limit is set to guarantee that the incident electron
retains enough energy to stay in the conduction band. With respect
to the lower limit, Boutboul et al.27,28 have set it
to zero, whereas the minimum energy loss was assigned by STPP25 as ωmin = Eg, the energy required to promote an electron from the
top of the valence band to the bottom of the conduction band. Such
a limit is associated with the minimum excitation energy of electrons
in the material.25 Results have shown that
the effect of ωmin = Eg instead ωmin = 0 on the IMFP calculations is less
than 1.5% for E ≥ 100 eV and increases up
to 6.5% at 54.6 eV.25

When we simulate
electron scattering, we use a dedicated electron–phonon
scattering model when such scattering is important. To avoid double-counting,
it is then necessary to exclude such scattering within the dielectric
formalism. We for this reason find it convenient to follow the STPP
practice of integrating from a nonzero minimum excitation energy,
ωmin. However, our materials have non-negligible
excitations at energies just below Eg that
we wish to include. In LiF, for examples, states at about 0.8 and
2.5 eV below the conduction band minimum have been assigned to bulk
excitons.37,38 Instead of ωmin = Eg, we therefore assign ωmin to the first energy loss value above mid-gap where the ELF exceeds
a threshold of 10–5 (i.e., large compared to the
negligible ELF values typical of most of the bandgap but small compared
to maximum ELF values typically of order 1 in the plasmon peaks above
the gap). Since the increase in ELF near the top of the gap is steep,
the value of ωmin so determined is not very sensitive
to other reasonable threshold values, and since ωmin is intentionally chosen to be where the ELF amplitude is small,
integrals are not sensitive to small changes in ωmin in the neighborhood of the chosen value. Even though the exciton
states included in this way may be excited by the primary electron,
they are electron–hole pair states so are unlikely final states
for the primary electron. Consequently, we do not alter the upper
limit of the ω integral. Thus, the resulting integral of eq 1 is 2  where T′ = T – Eg, T is the difference between the incident
electron’s energy and the energy at the bottom of the valence
band, wVB is the width of the valence
band, and c is the speed of light. The maximum energy
loss is determined by the requirement that the incident electron’s
final energy be no lower than the bottom of the conduction band. The
limits, q±, are the kinematic limits
of momentum transfer from the incident electron consistent with energy
loss ω and are given by 3  

To validate
our implementation, we reproduced the STPP25 calculation of the IMFP for Al2O3 using the
same input parameters (ωmin = Eg = 8.63 eV, ωVB = 8.0 eV)
and the same ELF data (kindly shared with us by S. Tanuma). Using
these data, we obtained the IMFP results shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 IMFP for Al2O3 calculated in this work using
the same input parameters and data used by Shinotsuka et al.25

STPP tabulated their
IMFP values rounded to three significant figures
for incident electron kinetic energies (relative to the bottom of
the conduction band) between 54.6 and 198789.2 eV at approximately
10% intervals. Our results when calculated at the same energies and
likewise rounded to three significant figures agree exactly with theirs.
For their graphed but untabulated results at energies below 50 eV,
we compared our results to estimates digitized from their graph. We
attribute the less than 1.5% difference to digitization error. Based
on this close agreement, we believe that our implementation is, as
intended, functionally the same as theirs, and we refer readers to
their meticulous descriptions for details.

3 Energy-Loss
Functions (ELF)
3.1 Optical-Data Acquisition
To compute
the IMFP, optical data such as scattering factors, f1 and f2, refractive index n, and extinction index k have been collected
from the literature.39−45Table 1 displays
the data used to compute the ELF and the available parameters according
to the published data.

The dielectric
function may be expressed with real and complex
components as 4  

In the optical limit of q→0, 5  and 6  where ϵ1 represents
the polarization term as a consequence of the interaction between
the material and the electromagnetic wave, and ϵ2 is the imaginary part, which is related to the energy loss.

It is also known that the interaction between photons and matter
can be described in terms of the refractive index decrement, δ,
and extinction coefficient, β, as46 7  

In eq 7, δ is
related to the real atomic-scattering factor f1, which represents the dispersive interaction between the
incoming plane wave and the material, while β is related to
the imaginary part of the atomic scattering factor f2 that accounts for radiation absorption. In the limit
of δ ≪ 1 and β ≪ 1 (e.g., energies above
100–200 eV, depending on the material), δ and β
are approximated by46 8   9  

Otherwise47 10   11  where NA is
Avogadro’s constant, re is the
classical electron radius, λ is the incident wavelength,
and f1 and f2 represent the real and complex components of the atomic-scattering
factor of a given atom, respectively. f1 and f2 of a compound are the sum of
the composition number of atoms in the compound’s molecular
formula. In this work, eqs 8 and 9 were used for data above 11 keV.

The energy-loss function (ELF) can be written as 12  

Due to the integration limits of the IMFP calculation (eq 2), information about the
band-gap energy, the valence band width, and the minimum energy limit
for each compound is required. Such information is given in Table 2.

CaF2	12.152	5.8453	10.33	
Al2O3	8.854	8.354	8.63	
3.2 Optical-Data Evaluation
To evaluate
the consistency of the ELF data, two mathematical rules were applied:
Kramers–Kronig sum (KK-sum) and Bethe sum
(f-sum). These two methods are indicators of the
reliability of the optical data. The f-sum more strongly
weights high energies while the KK-sum the low ones.
According to Tanuma et al.,19 the KK-sum integration is influenced mainly by optical data
in the energy range below 50 eV and the f-sum by
data above. The mathematical representation of the KK-sum(55,56) is 13  

In this work, n(0) was evaluated as the square root of the dielectric
constant of each material.

The Bethe sum (f-sum) evaluates the number of
electrons per atom or molecule that participate in the inelastic scattering
process and is mathematically expressed as57,58 14  where N is
the atomic or molecular density, me is
the electron mass, and ϵ0 is the permittivity of
free space. In eqs 13 and 14, ωmax is the maximum
energy that we take to be 1 MeV. In the limit of ωmax → ∞, Zeff → Z, and Peff → 1.

The selection of the best ELF data was done through a thorough
and rigorous evaluation process. To do that, we calculated the KK-sum and f-sum errors for each compound
using different combinations of optical data sources. We selected
the combination listed in Table 1, where the KK-sum and f-sum errors were the smallest. Table 3 displays the different compounds studied in this work
with the associated f-sum and KK-sum errors. The lower the f-sum and KK-sum errors are, the better the internal consistency of the data. The
data in Table 3 suggest
an acceptable consistency between the different experimental results
collected from the literature, mainly for liquid water and Al2O3. For Al2O3, the magnitude
of our f-sum error is somewhat larger than that of
Shinotsuka et al.,25 3.16% in this work
versus −1.2%, while our KK-sum error was more
than a factor of 2 better, 3.8% versus −7.8%. For liquid water,
the f-sum and KK-sum results are
0.21% vs 5.1% and 2.7% vs 3.7% from reference (23), respectively. This result
agrees quite well with the significant qualitative and quantitative
improvement expected when using the revised data provided by NIST.42 Comparing data in Table 3 for the different compounds, the ELF for
LiF has the highest error. However, the 13% KK-sum error obtained in
this work is less than half of the 30% reported in the previous study.19 Furthermore, both f-sum and KK-sum errors are substantially smaller than the 34.7 and
24.3%, respectively, as reported by Boutboul and colleagues.28 Regarding CaF2, the ELF data can be considered reasonably
accurate with f-sum and KK-sum errors
of 2.4 and 5.8%, respectively.

4 Results
4.1 Energy-Loss Function
Our results
for the energy-loss function are shown in Figure 2. As observed, all the materials typically
have several local maxima and minima. These are related to increases
or decreases in the inelastic-scattering probability. They are caused
by physical phenomena such as inner shell excitations, valence electron
excitations, plasmons, and excitons. Figure 2d also shows the ELF data used by Tanuma
and collaborators47 for Al2O3. Excellent agreement can be seen at energies greater than
30 eV. However, at lower energies, differences are observed, which
can be associated with the use of new optical data in this work as
compared to those by Tanuma and collaborators as explained above.

The IMFPs
for liquid water, LiF, CaF2, and Al2O3 as a function of the electron kinetic energy obtained through eq 2 and using input parameters
from Table 2 and ELF
data from Figure 2 are
shown in Figures 3, 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

material, the IMFP initially diminishes with increasing energy to
a broad minimum and then increases as the energy continues to increase.

a Note that, if desired, the scattering
cross sections (σ) can be computed from the IMFP values (λ)
using the formula λ–1 = Nσ and the following values of N: (3.34,6.12,2.45,2.34)
× 1022/cm3 for liquid H2O, LiF,
CaF2, and Al2O3 respectively.

Also shown in Figures 3, 4, and 6 are
the IMFP data reported in the literature. Relatively good agreement
can be observed at energies greater than 200 eV. Note that Figures 4, 5, and 6 include IMFP calculations using
the TPP-2M formula. As can be seen, qualitative agreement is obtained.

5 Discussion
From the IMFP data for Al2O3 shown in Figure 1, we see that when
we use the same ELF (Figure 2d) as STPP,25 we reproduce exactly
their result. However, our best estimates for the ELF data and other
input parameters differ somewhat from theirs, leading to the differences
shown in Figure 6.
We restrict the comparison to energies greater than or equal to 54.6
eV, above which Shinotsuka et al. tabulated their data. At energies
greater than 200 eV, our IMFP values are about 7.5% smaller than theirs,
but at energies below 200 eV, the difference increases to approximately
9%. The smaller difference at the higher energies is likely associated
with differences in the ELF, whereas the larger difference at lower
energies reflects sensitivity to the band gap and minimum integration
limit.

Comparing our results for liquid water shown in Figure 3 with updated data
reported
by Shinotsuka et al.,25 a difference of
2.5% is observed at energies greater than 150 eV and varies from 0.02
to 1.4% at energies between 40 and 150 eV. Below 40 eV, differences
from 1.3% up to 29% are found, being larger at lower energies. Reference (23) was published before Shinotsuka
et al. began modeling the effect of the band gap, and the lower integration
limit was set to zero.47 However, for the
updated data reported in ref (25), the Boutboul’s energy gap treatment was considered,
and the lower integration limit was set to Eg = 7.9 eV. The 2.5% difference at high energies appears to
be mainly attributable to differences in the ELF data. The larger
differences (up 29%) at low energies are associated with the sensitivity
to the band gap and its effect on the integration limits.

As
mentioned above, the TPP-2M formula20 has
been proposed to calculate the IMFP for LiF and other inorganic
compounds for which data are not available.25 In order to use this formula, four parameters are required. Thus,
in this work, we also calculated the IMFP for LiF, CaF2, and Al2O3 through the relativistic TPP-2M
formula by using equation 12 from ref (25). The LiF parameters came
from Table 7 of ref (19), but for Al2O3, we used parameters reported
in Table 6 of ref (25). For CaF2, equations 15a–15e of ref (25) were used. We used the
band gap from Table 2 of this work, while the plasmon energy and the number of valence
electrons per molecule were obtained elsewhere.59 These results are shown in Figures 4, 5, and 6 for LiF, CaF2, and Al2O3, respectively. As can be noted, qualitative agreements are
seen between our results and the results of the TPP-2M formula. The
differences (approximately −10% at energies below 200 eV and
−7.35% above) between our and STPP’s results for Al2O3 using the dielectric FPA are reproduced by the
TPP-2M formula. For CaF2, the difference is nearly constant
at −21% for energies over 200 eV and varies between −17
and 0.21% at lower energies. For LiF, the average differences are
around −4% at energies above 200 eV and vary from 5 to 34%
at energies below. In contrast, despite the remarkable difference
between the ELF KK-sum errors obtained
in this work and that of ref (19), the differences in input parameters, and the band-gap
treatment, the IMFP values obtained for LiF differ from that paper’s
dielectric-function theory results only by −7% in the 200–2000
eV energy range. Larger differences are evident in Figure 4 at low energies, but the TPP-2M
equation was claimed to be reliable at energies above 200 eV.25

Regarding the data for liquid water published
by Emfietzoglou et
al.,6,11 differences of up to 186% in the IMFPs are
found for the e-e model at energies below 100 eV. At higher energies,
the disagreements in the IMFPs vary from 2% up to 18% and between
0.7 and 46% for the e-e and IXS-D3 models, respectively. As mentioned
by Shinotsuka et al.,23 these differences
can be explained as consequences of the inclusion of exchange and
correlation effects and the use of a ϵ2(ω)
fit instead of the ELF data.6,11 As seen in Figure 3, the IMFP data from
Akkerman and Akkerman29 are very close
to those from Emfietzoglou’s e-e model. Similar differences
from 19 to 129% are obtained at energies below 100 eV and 2% at energies
above when compared to our results. The IMFP data at energies between
20 and 100 eV for liquid water reported by Garcia-Molina et al.31 and de Vera and Garcia-Molina33 are greater than ours by 7–21% and 15–20%,
respectively, while those from Nguyen-Truong32 are greater by 6–16% in the energy range from 35 to 100 eV
and smaller by 2.5–30% at energies down to 20 eV. At higher
energies, the differences are found to be 1.9%, 0.8%, and from 0.06
to 15%, respectively. Contrary to data from refs (6)(11), and (29), the results recently
published by Garcia-Molina et al.31,33 and Nguyen-Truong32 show smaller differences compared to our results
at energies between 20 and 100 eV. The differences observed at low
energies between our IMFPs and those reported in refs (31, 33) could presumably be interpreted as a consequence
of the ELF data sets used for the dielectric-function calculation,
which is very sensitive to the optical data, or due to the inclusion
of higher-order corrections to the first-Born approximation and/or
the integration limit33 as mentioned above.
For example, Garcia-Molina et al.31 used
a Mermin energy-loss-function–generalized-oscillator-strength
(MELF-GOS) model for describing the ELF in their method, Akkerman
and Akkerman29 used a Drude-type variation
for the ELF construction, and Nguyen-Truong32 considered an ELF based on a Mermin–Levine–Louie (MLL)
dielectric function.

Considering the results for Al2O3 published
by Pandya et al.26 and Akkerman et al.,27 differences of up to 270 and 57% in the IMFPs
are obtained, respectively, at energies below 100 eV. At higher energies,
the reported IMFPs differ from this work by around 6–20%26 and 0.3–35%,27 respectively. The observed difference between our results and the
data published by Akkerman et al.27 could
be due to the combination of the dielectric theory with a classical
binary-encounter approximation used in their work. With respect to
Pandya et al.,26 the difference can be
associated with the semiempirical quantum-mechanical method used to
obtain the atomic molecular inelastic cross section.

As is evident
from the above discussion, there is variation among
reported calculated IMFP values, relatively small at high energies,
but several tens of percent at energies below 50 eV. Some of the variation
is due to uncertainties in the modeling, for example, use of the Born
approximation (a high-energy approximation) in the derivation of eq 1, the choice of extension
model (e.g., Mermin or Lindhard components, discrete or continuous)
to extend available ELF(0, ω) to ELF(q >
0,
ω), and the choice of whether to include exchange and correlation
effects or not, and if so, how. The choice of extension algorithm can make a difference of 5% at
10 keV and 25% at 50 eV.11,60 Exchange and correlation
effects can be in the range of from −2 to +15% at 10 keV and
from −15 to +35% at 50 eV.11

The errors in the IMFP associated with input parameters such as
the band-gap and valence band-width energies have been assessed. Considering
the variation of the data reported in the literature, we estimated
the best values of these parameters to within 1 eV. We found that
the maximum errors associated with the valence band width to be approximately
2.3, 2.1, 1.6, and 3.3% for liquid water, LiF, CaF2, and
Al2O3, respectively, at energies below 100 eV,
while those related to the energy gap were 1.2, 0.0014, 0.007, and
0.28%, respectively. As observed, the errors due to the valence band
width are greater than those related to the band-gap energy. The results
indicate that these errors are not so important relative to the model
uncertainties described above.

6 Conclusions
In this
work, the electron inelastic mean free path for LiF, CaF2, Al2O3, and liquid water has been investigated
from 443 keV down to the energy gap. The calculation was performed
using the dielectric-function model through the relativistic full
Penn algorithm (FPA). An integration limit that accounts for the band-gap,
the valence band width, and the exciton interactions has been established.
The results suggest that, at electron energies below 100 eV, the different
choices of models for integration limits can affect the IMFP by up
to 29% and the exciton interaction by ∼9%. At energies greater
than 100 eV, the difference between our results and those from STPP25 for Al2O3 is around 7.5%,
which is associated with choice of the ELF and other input parameters.
