Modular plasmid architectures have
shown to be a very useful resource
to standardize, build, share, and compare biological parts and functional
vectors, and are being applied in an increasing number of microorganisms.
Here, we present a modular plasmid toolkit for Thermus
thermophilus, a species considered as a workhorse
for biotechnology and a model for high-temperature biology. Apart
from integrating improved versions of already existing parts, we have
characterized specific promoters and developed a thermosensor-based
palette that restricts the expression to Thermus and,
at the same time, controls protein expression in this organism in
a temperature-dependent manner.

Introduction
Modular plasmid systems
have been described for a number of taxons
(see ref1 for a review). These systems
represent clear improvements since they comprehend and enhance traditional
toolkits commonly used to operate with the corresponding host species.
Standardization of parts and components, as in other fields, is highly
desirable as it has generally streamlined assembly and made observations
easier to compare. Expectably, most of the modular plasmid systems
have been developed for mesophilic bacteria; however, there are two
modular systems for extremophiles: one is the pHsal series for the
archaeon Halobacterium salinarum,2 and the other is the Geobacillus plasmid set demonstrated on Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius.3

The genus Thermus includes a high number of bacterial
thermophilic strains isolated from both marine and terrestrial natural
environments and from man-made thermal facilities.4 In addition to their use as a source of thermostable enzymes
of biotechnological interest, the strains of Thermus
thermophilus (Tth), HB27 and HB8, have been used for
a long time as model organisms of life at a high temperature, as test
and selection systems for thermostable enzymes, and as sources of
proteins and protein complexes for structural biology studies.5 Both Tth strains can grow from 55 to 80 °C,
have a small genome consisting of a chromosome of around 2 Mb, accompanied
by at least one megaplasmid (0.23 Mb), and another smaller plasmid
for the HB8 strain.6 Their genome has a
high GC content (69%), high coding density (95%, 2200 genes), and
a low number of paralog genes. Compared to other extreme thermophiles,
Tth strains grow fast and reach high cell densities in rich liquid
medium under aerobic conditions (40 min doubling time at 70 °C).
They can utilize a variety of saccharides and amino acids as carbon
sources and form individual colonies on agar plates, thus allowing
the isolation of clonal populations. In addition, the most useful
characteristic of Tth as a laboratory model is the constitutive expression
of a complex natural competence apparatus (NCA), which, among other
components, includes type IV-like pili, which make these strains easy
to transform with very high efficiency.7 Together with that, the strain HB27 shows also high proficiency
in a process similar to conjugation, named transjugation, that occurs
in two steps, pull and push, requiring the NCA in the recipient strain
(pull) and a DNA donation system based on a DNA translocase encoded
within a small operon of a mobile element (push).8

The existing toolkit for genetic manipulation of
Tth is versatile
and continues to expand. Plasmids, with different origins of replication,9,10 have been described, as well as three thermostable antibiotic resistances;11−13 one inducible (Pnar)14 and several constitutive
promoters;15,16 a number of reporter genes, including
those of a thermostable superfolder GFP,17 a β-galactosidase,14 the phytoene
synthase,18 and others; and three counterselection
markers.19 More recently, the Cre-lox system
has also been added to the Tth toolbox.20 However, up to now, a modular system for Tth equivalent to those
available for other microorganisms has not been developed.

Likewise,
the accurate regulation of gene expression of both endogenous
and heterologous genes in Tth, while potentially quite useful, has
not been systematically addressed. A number of bifunctional promoters
that work constitutively in Escherichia coli and in Tth16,21 have been described. However,
in a workflow consisting of library-making in E. coli, to obtain a high number and diversity collections of genes, with
subsequent transfer to Tth to screen for thermostable proteins, the
best strategy would be to ensure expression in Tth while, at the same
time, reducing it as much as possible in E. coli to avoid plasmid instability and/or the negative effect on representation
produced by toxicity of exogenous proteins.

The work presented
here describes the construction of a modular
plasmid system that allows the á la carte assembly into a single
plasmid of two replicative origins, up to three selection markers
active in a wide temperature range, promoters, and cargo genes. This
plasmid system will flexibilize the work with T. thermophilus and simultaneously allow for the bidirectional transfer to or from
an appropriate mesophilic host. We also develop a series of RNA thermosensors
that allow the finely regulated expression of a reporter superfolder
citrine version of GFP (IFP) in Tth, while at the same time, the RNA
structure keeps the expression turned off in a mesophilic host.

Results
and Discussion
Design and Construction of the Modular pMoT
Plasmid
To assemble the modular plasmid chassis pMoT (plasmid
Modular Thermus) (Figure 1), we started, as a first module, with the
robust replication
origin from pMK189,22 (pMY1 origin, pEM2S minimal origin
construct, Figure 1B, see the Supporting Information for
a list of plasmids and strains) that comprises the coding sequence
for the replication origin type RepA binding protein and the origin
itself (see Table S4 for sequences). We
included two pairs of unique enzyme restriction sites flanking the
replication origin: PstI and PacI at the 3′ end of Tth replication origin and AatII and NotI sites at the 5′ end. As an alternative
origin of replication for Thermus spp., we have set
up a 2400-bp fragment containing the origin of replication from plasmid
pTT8.10 A second module for antibiotic
selection follows the PacI site and includes the
strong PslpA promoter, active both in Tth and E. coli,23 that drives the expression of the
antibiotic resistance gene of choice, followed in all cases by an AscI site. Three thermostable antibiotic resistance cassettes
are available that confer resistance to kanamycin, hygromycin B (a
more thermostable version, Bosch et al.99), and bleomycin B (Figure 1B).11−13 The three markers work robustly and stably in both
Tth at 65 °C and E. coli at 37
°C, which makes the addition of a dedicated antibiotic resistance
for the mesophilic host unnecessary, keeping the plasmid at a minimum
size. A strong Rho-independent transcriptional terminator from the
SlpA gene is located after the antibiotic resistance cassette, and
the cargo module follows this terminator. We have tested several promoters
(see below) and selected the nqo promoter (Pnqo)24 as the standard for cargo expression because it is very
active in Tth but essentially inactive in E. coli (see below). The strength of Pnqo is comparable to that of the promoter
PslpA or that of the 16S rRNA, both commonly considered
to be very active in bacteria25,26 (see below). An EcoRI site follows Pnqo and then a ribosome binding site
and an NdeI site that can be used for the expression
of any cloned gene from its ATG codon. The cargo gene can be cloned
between EcoRI (with its own RBS) or NdeI and HindIII sites. As a reporter, we have used
a superfolder citrine fluorescent protein (sIFP) (see the Supporting Information), but as mentioned above,
we also have available genes for β-galactosidase, alkaline phosphatase,
and β-carotene synthesis and a thermostabilized version of esterase
I from Pseudomonas fluorescens (Maté
et al.100) as reporters (Figure 1B). Finally, a module for replication
in mesophilic hosts is included between the HindIII
and NotI sites. In addition to the pUC-derived replicon
with a high copy number in E. coli,
the pBBR Gram-negative broad host range replicon from the pSEVA131
vector has been also tested.27 We have
also constructed a series of plasmids with a polylinker (linker A)
in place of the promoter-cargo modules (Figure 1C), and we have constructed a series of plasmids
with Pnqo in front of polylinkers, with RBSs directing expression
in the three reading frames for library cloning and testing (linkers
1, 2, and 3, Figure 1C).

Assessment of Promoters for the Expression
of the Cargo Genes
in T. thermophilus and E. coli
The modular plasmid was used in
combination with sIFP to test a number of promoters to define their
behavior in Tth (Figure 2A) and in E. coli (Figure 2B). As shown in Figure 2A, Pnqo is a strong promoter
in Tth (NQO) but has no detectable activity in E. coli (Figure 2B). By contrast,
a version of the Plac promoter with an incomplete lac operator (LAC)
is almost inactive in Tth but is strongly expressed in E. coli. Fluorescence from similar plasmids without
sIFP (pMoTK) or with sIFP without a promoter (Δprom) was almost
negligible. The promoters from the 16S rRNA28 from Tth are strong in both Tth and E. coli (Figure 2A,B, bar 16S). We also tested a “three kingdom”
(3K) promoter from the archaeon Haloferax volcanii, described as also active in transcription in E.
coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae(29) with the idea of having a multikingdom
promoter operating in our system. However, the 3K promoter showed
low levels of transcription in E. coli and extremely low levels in Tth (Figure 2A,B, bar 3K) (see below).

levels measured for the indicated promoters in E. coli cultured at 37 °C. nqo variants as indicated in Figure 3B.

The combination of the presence of an antibiotic and the expression
of antibiotic resistance could have an effect on the expression levels
of the cargo gene. Therefore, we tested fluorescence generated from
plasmids pMoTK, pMoTB, and pMoTH, endowing resistance to kanamycin,
hygromycin, and bleomycin, respectively. For these assays, the sIFP
gene was expressed from Pnqo3A, a smaller derivative of Pnqo with
essentially the same activity. As shown in Figure 2A, pMoTB and pMoTH produce in Tth about 50%
more fluorescence than pMoTK (bars K 3A, B 3A, and H 3A). On the other
hand, the expression from Pnqo3A within a pMoTK derivative with pTT8
replication origin is reduced to 17% compared with the same construct
with the pMY1 origin (bars Ori 2-3A vs K 3A), in accordance with the
fact that the pTT8 origin yields lower copy number vectors.10 Finally, the putative effects of the absence
of the Argonaute protein in the expression was assayed as Δago mutants are commonly used for cloning purposes in Tth
due to their higher transformation efficiencies.30 As shown by the corresponding bar (Figure 2A, bar 3A ΔAgo), the expression levels
in this mutant is similar to those in the corresponding wild-type
strain.

Analysis of the Pnqo Elements in T. thermophilus and E. coli
The data above
show that the Pnqo promoter is only functional in Tth, showing no
activity at all in E. coli (Figure 2A,B), and so, it
matches the profile for a promoter that ensures good expression in
Tth while preventing unwanted activity in E. coli. To further study Pnqo, we performed serial deletions from its 5′
end, and their promoter activities were assayed in Tth and E. coli. As shown in Figure 3A, deletion of regions
upstream of position −72 from the ATG start codon produced
nonsignificant variations in the activity respect to the original
Pnqo, which extended to position −446. Interestingly, deletions
nqo91 and nqo72 increased the expression by around 10-fold in E. coli with respect to the intact promoter (Figure 3A), probably due
to the new upstream regions added in the construction (Figure 3B). Further deletions down
to position −57 or −33 produced the complete loss of
promoter activity in Tth, supporting the presence of relevant sequences
for the binding of the Tth RNA polymerase between positions −72
and −57. Actually, the sequence between these positions is
similar to an extended −10 promoter box consensus (Figure 3B). To verify if
this was the case, we made point mutations on that putative box and
also mutated a putative −35 box (TTGCGC) found between positions
−82 and −76, all in the context of the nqo91 deletion
mutant that retained almost full activity. As it is shown in Figure 3A, mutations leading
to a nonconsensus −35 box (column nqo91-35) did not produce
a decrease in the promoter activity, whereas any of the pairs of mutations
on the extended −10 box (nqo91E-10, nqo91-10, nqo91-7) strongly
reduced the promoter activity. Since the nqo72 version of the promoter
is also active in E. coli, we combined
the nqo72 version with the extended −10 region mutants, and
we observed that, while the activity is still strongly reduced in
Tth (nqo72-E10 to nqo72-7), it is still active, although decreased
by 50%, in E. coli (Figure 2B). These results suggest that
the Pnqo promoter in Tth is heavily reliant on an extended −10
TATA element, while on the other hand, for expression in E. coli, a −35 box would be needed, whereas
the promoter strength in E. coli is
not so much dependent on the extended −10 region.

sequence of the nqo promoter at the 3′ end. nqo91-35, mutations

nqo72-7, same mutations introduced on Pnqo72; 3Knqo72, hybrid 3K-nqo72
promoter. (B) Sequences of nqo promoter mutants.

Finally, since we had delimitated a minimal promoter with good
activity in Tth and significant activity in E. coli, we replaced the region described as needed for expression in E. coli in the 3K promoter by the nqo72 derivative
while keeping the sequences required for expression in H. volcanii and S. cerevisiae. The new 3Knqo72 promoter showed 40% of the activity relative to
wild-type Pnqo (Figure 3A) in Tth but still had low activity in E. coli. This suggests that the 3Knqo72 promoter could be a promising tool
for a bifunctional Thermus-Haloferax promoter.

The Use of Thermosensors for High-Temperature
Protein Expression
Given the different growth temperatures
of E. coli and Tth, we reasoned that
RNA thermosensors could serve as adequate
controllers of gene expression in the context of the pMoT plasmids
in two ways: first, by granting expression in Tth while repressing
it in E. coli and, second, by allowing
the fine-tuning of expression in Tth just by changing the growth temperature
to induce the opening or closing of the relevant thermosensor. Inspired
on a previous report,31 we designed a series
of RNA thermosensors acting by RBS occlusion in stem-loop structures
with melting temperatures, derived from ΔG,
ranging from 50 to 70 °C (see Figure 4B and Figure S1 for predicted structures and ΔG). The thermosensors
were inserted between hygromycin B and the sIFP gene in bicistronic
constructions expressed from the PslpA promoter in a pMoTH. In these
constructs, expression of hygromycin phosphotransferase should be
unaffected, while the sIFP gene should be regulated by the thermosensors.
The thermosensor-bearing plasmids were transformed into the Δago mutant strain. The fluorescence measures obtained under
different conditions are shown in Figure 4A, and confirmatory immunodetection of sIFP
is shown in Figure 4C, with quantization of three representative experiments performed
at 55 and 65 °C, as presented in Figure 4D. A linear correlation between fluorescence
and Western blot data is shown in Figure S2. It can be observed that expression in E. coli is almost completely abolished by the presence of any of the thermosensors
(orange columns), whereas the control with polyA at the same place
(PA) or without a thermosensor (direct fusion (DF)) showed strong
or intermediate fluorescence, respectively. This indicates that the
thermosensors can be used to restrict expression out from a mesophilic
host while having good expression in Tth. On the other hand, the thermosensors
also produced repression of expression in Tth with respect to the
controls, following approximately the pattern expected due to the ΔG’s associated to the different structures. However,
unexpectedly, for a given thermosensor, there is an apparent increase
in expression at 55 and 60 °C with respect to the expression
at 65 °C. Also, this effect is also observed in the control plasmid
pMoTH 3A when IFP is driven by the Pnqo promoter without any thermosensor.
This effect is contrary to the behavior predicted for the different
thermosensors that should tend to derepress expression with the increase
in temperature. At present, we do not know the reasons for this increased
expression at 55 and 60 °C. In any event, the differences in
expression levels obtained with the thermosensor series span about
2 orders of magnitude, and the range of thermosensors can be used
to regulate expression from very low levels (thermosensors 2, 4, and
6) through medium levels (P and 1) to high levels (0, 10, and 8).
The results obtained with this thermosensor series are similar or,
in some cases, better than those in reported studies, yielding induction
folds of 10 to 35 times with respect to the uninduced state.32,33 We get a maximum of 13-fold induction of expression of IFP when
comparing normalized expression in E. coli with normalized expression in Tth (TS8) and, by Western blot quantization,
some 180-fold differences between the construct and the highest expression
(PA) and the lowest one (TS6). While, additionally, in our study,
we use the thermosensors to repress expression in a mesophilic host
and to regulate protein output with the same vector in a thermophilic
model, this had not been reported before. On the other hand, our system
would be susceptible of improvement since better systems of induction
of expression for Tth are desirable, and further work based on this
set of thermosensors could lead to easy-to-use expression systems.

blot sIFP bands. Labels are the same as in (A).

The thermosensors presented here, as they are based on physical
properties, could also be utilized to regulate gene expression not
only in Tth but also in other thermophilic organisms. We expect that
the thermosensors, together with the modular plasmid system described
here, will help build and standardize future work and developments
on Tth biology.

Materials and Methods
Bacterial Strains and Growth
Conditions
Bacterial strains
and plasmids used in this work together with growth conditions are
listed in the Supporting Methods (Supporting
Information).

Nucleic Acid Manipulation
Primers
and plasmids used
in this work are listed in Tables S2 and S3, respectively. Plasmid construction, purification, restriction analysis,
and DNA sequencing were performed by standard methods. DNA was amplified
by PCR using 1 U/100 μL of DNA polymerase PfuUltra II (Roche
Molecular Biochemicals) in its recommended buffer with 200 μM
dNTP mixture and 1 μM of each primer (Sigma-Aldrich).

Plasmid
Construction
The parts used to assemble pMoT
plasmids and their sequences are listed in Table S4. Parts were PCR-amplified using the primers listed in Table S2, adding the appropriate restriction
sites, and plasmids were assembled by ligation to produce the plasmids
listed in Table S3. Construction was started
with pMoTK110. All the constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Additional
details about constructs can be found in the Supporting Methods.

Promoter Activity Assays
The promoter
regions to be
tested were cloned between sites NheI and EcoRI in the plasmid pMoTK110, driving the expression of
superfolder sIFP. Expression from these promoters was assayed on transformed T. thermophilus strains after growth of overnight
10 mL cultures to saturation at 65 °C followed by dilution to
OD600 = 0.05 and then culture for 24 h at the indicated
temperatures. Fluorescence measures were performed on 1.66 ×
108 cells, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 200
μL using a FLUOstar Optima (BMG Labtech, Germany) fluorimeter.
Measures were performed from three biological replicates and at least
three technical replicates for each condition.

Western Blotting
Tth cells transformed with the corresponding
plasmids were cultured as described above, and then total cell extracts
were prepared by resuspending 109 cells in 200 μL
of loading buffer and boiling for 15 min. The extracts were analyzed
by SDS-PAGE, electrotransferred to a PVDF membrane, and detected with
specific rabbit antisera (anti-GFP polyclonal (Chromotek) and anti-Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase α subunit
as a control (the later, a kind gift from Margarita Salas). The membranes
were developed using horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit antibodies
and bioluminescence assay (ECL, Amersham International). Western blot
band quantization was performed with an Amersham Imager 680 chemiluminescence
reader using the ImageJ image analysis software.34
