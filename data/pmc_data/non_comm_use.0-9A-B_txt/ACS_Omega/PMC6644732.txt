Transformation
of C5 furaldehydes to the corresponding C6 furaldehydes
over a heterogeneous catalyst is a versatile but demanding reaction
process. This report describes our discovery that Amberlyst-15, a
conventional sulfuric functionalized resin, affords a 43.1% yield
for 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde (HMF) production with 57.5% selectivity
via direct hydroxymethylation of 2-furaldehyde (furfural) with an
aqueous formaldehyde reagent. This report is the first to describe
an important achievement on the heterogeneous acid catalyst-assisted
HMF production from furfural via direct hydroxymethylation in a batch
reactor system. The Amberlyst-15 was also reusable and applicable
for C5 furaldehyde upgrading of various types: furfuryl alcohol, furfurylamine,
and furoic acid toward the corresponding C6 furaldehydes. Results
show that a liquid flow system becomes an advanced tool for the continuous
production of upgrading furaldehydes through a fixed Amberlyst-15
catalyst bed. Accordingly, the sulfuric functionalized resin-catalyzed
direct hydroxymethylation of furaldehydes with aqueous formaldehyde
in both batch and flow reactor systems is worthwhile and opens up
new avenues for biomass transformations in particles, an important
area of inedible biomass utilization.

Introduction
Highly efficient transformation
of biomass resources to chemicals
and fuels has been studied in catalyst research because utilization
of these biomass-based materials is expected to contribute to future
human society based on green and carbon-neutral concepts. Moreover,
enhancement of biomass usage is highly desired to reduce reliance
on conventional fossil fuel resources, which are limited and entail
high CO2 emissions.

Furaldehydes such as 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furaldehyde
(HMF) and 2-furaldehyde
(furfural) are regarded as platform materials for cellulose-based
and hemicellulose-based biorefinery transformations. Therefore, many
efforts have been devoted to the generation of such furaldehydes with
economical and environmental-friendly methodologies.1−5 HMF, a hexose (C6)-derived furaldehyde, is regarded as a promising
building block to produce valuable chemicals because it possesses
two functional groups (formyl and hydroxyl group) in a furan ring.
Selective oxidation,6,7 hydrogenation,8,9 reductive
amination,10 reductive cleavage,11−13 hydrolytic ring opening,14−16 hydrogenative rearrangement,17 and so on have been examined to afford upgraded
HMF derivatives.1 Ever-increasing interest
and challenges to develop HMF utility are anticipated to continue
into future investigations in this area.

However, for furfural
transformations, a pentose (C5)-derived furaldehyde,
production of furfuryl alcohol,18,19 levulinic acid (LA)
or relative esters,20 diols,21−23 and amine24,25 are regarded as versatile routes.
Unfortunately, such schemes affording value-added chemicals from furfural
have not been conducted in as many various ways as the vastly numerous
possible HMF transformation styles.26−28 Apparently, the structural
character of furfural, a formyl group linked on a furan ring at the
second position, limits its potential as a starting material. To attenuate
the shortcomings of C5 furaldehyde, we have specifically examined
direct hydroxymethylation of furfural and its derivatives with a formaldehyde
reagent to produce HMF-like derivatives (C6), a furan ring composed
of two functional groups.

Catalytic transformation of C5 to
C6 furaldehydes has been investigated
by very few research groups. Important discussions have been undertaken
by Moreau and co-workers about the direct hydroxymethylation of furaldehydes
with 37% aqueous formaldehyde in the presence of dealuminated mordenite
as a catalyst.29−32 They achieved maximum performance of approximately 10% yield for
HMF production from furfural under a high molecular ratio of formaldehyde/furfural
(ca. 240)29 and 67.5% yield for 2,5-bis(hydroxymethyl)furan
(BHMF) production from furfuryl alcohol with formaldehyde/furfuryl
alcohol of 111.30

As an attractive
reaction route, direct hydroxymethylation of furfurylamine
by a mineral acid to afford 5-(hydroxymethyl)furfurylamine (HMFA)
has been examined by some groups. However, the yield only slightly
approached a significant value (<10%).33,34 On the basis of a similar concept, production of 2,5-furandicarboxylic
acid (FDCA) from furfural was also attempted with a homogeneous catalytic
system via multiple reactions in 1962.35 It is noteworthy that unique C–H carboxylation of furoic
acid to FDCA with CO2 in the presence of alkali media was
generated only very recently.36 However,
such C5 to C6 transformation under the control of double functional
groups indeed remains a challenging subject.

Herein, we examined
heterogeneous acid catalyst-assisted direct
hydroxymethylation of furfural and its derivatives with aqueous formaldehyde,
in particular, that of furfural to HMF. From the perspective of biomass
feedstock issues, transformation of such inedible biomass-based furfural
to edible biomass-based HMF is expected to be interesting for various
research areas.

Results and Discussion
Table 1 presents
results for hydroxymethylation of furfural to HMF with aqueous formaldehyde
over various solid catalysts. Commercial acidic resins, several types
of zeolites, and solid acids were used for the reaction. Conventional
solid acids such as WO3, CeO2, γ-Al2O3, TiO2 (anatase), ZnO, and ZrO2 gave no activity for the HMF production (<1% yields) (entries
11–16) via direct hydroxymethylation of furfural. Among zeolite
catalysts, mordenite (SiO2/Al2O3 =
18.3) and zeolite Y (SiO2/Al2O3 =
5.6) were also inactive (entries 9 and 10), although ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 = 90) and zeolite β (SiO2/Al2O3 = 25) gave mild activity with
12.3% yield and 23.0% yield (entries 7 and 8), respectively. Nafion
NR50, a well-known commercial acidic resin catalyst that possesses
strong acidity (Ho < −12)a but low acid amount (0.8 mmol g–1)a, exhibited a similar value for the activity:
24.6% yield (entry 6).

a Reaction conditions:
furfural (1
mmol, 10 mmolb), formalin (5 mL), catalyst
(200 mg), time (12 h, 15 hb), temp. (363
K), stirring (500 rpm). cCalcined at 773
K for 5 h.

It is noteworthy
that Amberlyst-type acidic resins such as polystyrene
resin decorated with sulfuric acid functionalities served higher yield
and selectivity for such demanding reaction (entries 1–5).
Numerous yields were found over Amberlyst-15 (Ho = −2.20, acid amount; 4.70 mmol g–1)a with 40.4% (entry 1) and Amberlyst-35 (Ho = −2.65, acid amount; 5.00 mmol g–1)a with 37.3% (entry 3). The
former showed much better selectivity (57.1%) than the latter (44.0%).
Note that Amberlyst-15 was composed by monosulfonic acid functionality
in a polystyrene unit at the para position (p-toluenesulfonic
acid), whereas Amberlyst-35 was composed by disulfonic acid functionalities
in a polystyrene unit.a The large-scale reaction
also produced a nice quantity of HMF over Amberlyst-15 (entry 2).
Unique Amberlyst-46 (acid amount; 0.43 mmol g–1,
which was condensed on the outer surface of resin)a and Amberlyst-45 (acid amount; 2.95 mmol g–1, a high thermal stability; approx. 443 K)a showed 20.4% yield and 28.2%, respectively (entries 4 and 5).

It is observed that the strong homogeneous acids of H2SO4, HCl, and p-toluenesulfonic acid
served high yields for HMF production with ca. 35% yields with ca.
45% selectivity. Weak homogeneous mineral acids of H3PO3 and H3PO4 provided a low yield of 7.6
and 14.2%, respectively, but high selectivity (ca. 55%) (see the Supporting Information, Table S2). It would be
noted that Amberlyst-15, Amberlyst-35, Amberlyst-45, Amberlyst-46,
and Nafion NR50 showed 16.3% conversion (46.9% selectivity), 18.9%
conversion (49.4% selectivity), 23.4% conversion (41.7% selectivity),
13.6% conversion (20.3% selectivity), and 16.1% conversion (20.7%
selectivity), respectively, at 1 h reaction. Accordingly, Amberlyst-15
has comparable activity to such conventional homogeneous acid catalysts.
Earlier reports have described that Amberlyst-15 acts as an effective
heterogeneous acid catalyst for hydration,14 dehydration,37,38 esterification,39 and so on.40−43

To optimize details of the reaction system, effects of the
formaldehyde
concentration (ratio of formaldehyde/furfural) and stirring speed
were also monitored with Amberlyst-15. It was clearly observed that
high concentrations of formaldehyde in reaction media exhibited the
positive effect of hastening the target reaction (see the Supporting Information, Figure S2). Moreover,
it was discovered that swelling of the resin catalyst in the solvent
had a detrimental effect during mixing in the batch reactor system.
However, such diffusion-limited access on the Amberlyst-15 catalyst
scarcely influenced the reactivity under our conditions (400–600
rpm stirring) (see the Supporting Information, Figure S3). Other formaldehyde-donating reagents such as 1,3,5-trioxane
and para(formaldehyde) gave lower activities under the same conditions
(see the Supporting Information, Table
S3). Utilization of formaldehyde solution was favorable from the view
point of the manufacturing process.44

The time-based reaction progression over the Amberlyst-15 catalyst
is shown in Figure 1. Both conversion and yield increased together as a function of time
up to 15 h; the maximum yield was 43.1% with 57.5% selectivity. Thereafter,
gradual decreases of HMF yield were observed with a continuous increase
of furfural conversion; 43.1% of HMF yield dropped to 26.0% during
an additional 9 h reaction. Actually, HMF consumption was expected
during the reaction. Because LA was found as a byproduct in the HPLC
chart (see the Supporting Information,
Figure S1), successive hydrolysis of HMF produced over Amberlyst-1514 was identified as one of the unfavorable reactions.
Formic acid (FA), another product of HMF hydrolysis, was observed
only to a slight degree in the HPLC chart because of the peak overlapping
with formaldehyde, while the presence of FA was supported by gas chromatography–time-of-flight
mass spectrometry (GC–TOFMS) analysis. The time-based reaction
progression of HMF consumption under the present condition was investigated
(see the Supporting Information, Figure
S4). In fact, gradual processing of the transformation of HMF toward
LA production was detected; however, over half of the HMF molecules
still remained after 12 h stirring. Therefore, it was considered that
both HMF production from furfural via hydroxymethylation and HMF consumption
to LA via successive hydrolysis competitively occurred and determines
the yield of HMF in our study. Compounds of various types were present
in the reaction mixture, as suggested by a GC–TOFMS analysis
as byproducts. However, it is difficult to identify all reasonable
side reactions at this stage. It was also detected that 1,3,5-trioxane
and 1,3,5,7-tetroxane were generated during reaction through formaldehyde
condensations by GC–TOFMS analysis.b In
addition, according to an earlier report, it was expected that resinification
reaction of C5 hydrogen and the protonated carbonyl group and condensation
reactions of the carbonyl group with formaldehyde occurred under acidic
conditions, leading to resin formation.29

reaction progression of the hydroxymethylation of furfural
to HMF over Amberlyst-15 in a batch reactor. Reaction conditions:
furfural (1 mmol), formalin (5 mL), catalyst (200 mg), temp (363 K),
stirring (500 rpm).

Reusability is one important
benefit of the heterogeneous catalysis
system against the homogeneous analogue. As shown in Figure 2, the Amberlyst-15 catalyst
constantly gave similar performance using a simple procedure through
four runs without a marked decrease in reactivity (see the Experimental Section). Therefore, it was expected
that deposits on the catalyst surface had a noncrucial impact in the
case of Amberlyst-15. It is also an advantage for the resin catalyst
that no loss of catalyst weight occurs during recycling procedures.
The turn over number for HMF production was estimated to be >1.7
for
four runs, and this is implied that the acid site on Amberlyst-15
could enhance not only the target reaction but also side and/or over-reactions
(vide supra).

furfural (1 mmol), formalin (5 mL), catalyst (200 mg), time (12 h),
temp (363 K), stirring (500 rpm).

A variety of bifunctionalized furans such as BHMF, HMFA,
and 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furancarboxylic
acid (HMFCA) have also been attractive and powerful materials to afford
valuable biomass-based chemical intermediates. Therefore, further
application of Amberlyst-15-induced hydroxymethylations of three furans
was attempted using the Amberlyst-15-catalyzed system. As shown in Table 2, 34.7, 14.3, and
23.8% yields for BHMF, HMFA, and HMFCA were successively obtained,
respectively, from furfuryl alcohol, furfurylamine, and furoic acid
used as a substrate (entries 1, 3, and 5). Highly reactive furfuryl
alcohol and furfuryl amine were almost entirely consumed (conv. >
92%) within 1 h, although furoic acid gave a lower conversion value
(68.4%).c Apparently, the lower yields for BHMF
and HMFA were attributed to the considerably higher reactivity of
substrates of furfuryl alcohol and furfuryl amines, whereas the lower
value for the HMFCA yield is attributable to the lower reactivity
of furoic acid (see the Supporting Information, Figure S5). High reactivity of former substrates were not inhibited
significantly even at a lower operation temperature of 313 K (entries
2 and 4). According to these results, not only the activation of the
fifth position of a furan ring but also prohibitions of side reactions
are expected to serve a crucial role for the futural catalyst design
in this system.

mmol), formalin (5 mL), Amberlyst-15 (200 mg), time (15 minb, 1 hc, 15 hd), temp. (313 Ke, 363
K), stirring (500 rpm).

To investigate a key factor for the direct hydroxymethylation of
furaldehydes, the initial rates for HMF production among four types
of Amberlyst resin catalysts were monitored with the same amount of
acid sites in a reaction media. Figure 3 shows the time-based reaction for HMF production over
Amberlyst-type resin catalysts within 1 h reaction. It was observed
that the reactivity was of the following order: Amberlyst-46 >
Amberlyst-15
≈ Amberlyst-45 > Amberlyst-35. Interestingly, the unique
Amberlyst-46
gave 1.62 (1.78) times faster activity than Amberlyst-15 (Amberlyst-45)
and 2.46 times faster than Amberlyst-35, at initial stage of the reaction.
However, during 24 h reaction, other three Amberlyst resin catalysts
did not achieve the higher activity than Amberlyst-15; that is, 43.1%
yield with 57.5% selectivity (Figure S6).

Figure 3 Time-based reaction for HMF production over Amberlyst-type resin
catalysts. Reaction conditions: furfural (1 mmol), formalin (5 mL),
acid site (0.94 mmol), time (1 h), temp (363 K), stirring (500 rpm).
Dashed lines represent the linear approximation result.

As an advanced study, application of the liquid
flow system for
continuous production of C6 furaldehydes through the heterogeneous
catalyst bed was demonstrated further. Flow reactor systems have been
demonstrated in various organic transformation reactions.45,46 As presented in Figure 4A, HMF productions over Amberlyst-15 in a flow reactor gave
constant values of around 35.5% yield and 48% selectivity;d that is, 70 mM HMF solution was provided constantly
from a 200 mM furfural solution during 24 h. BHMF production is also
apparently applicable for a flow reactor system (see the Supporting Information, Table S5). However, from
the view point of selectivity, both HMF and BHMF values obtained in
the flow reactor were lower than that in a batch reactor system in
the case of Amberlyst-15. While in the case of Amberlyst-46, an increase
in selectivity was observed in the flow reactor in comparison with
that in a bath reactor system, the constant value was around 20% yield
with 59% selectivity (Figure 4B). According to these observations, a new catalyst and/or
reactor design to transcend the present reactivity derived from sulfuric
functionalized resin catalyst, especially Amberlyst-15 and/or Amberlyst-46,
is needed for the next generation in this area.e

[furfural (14 mmol)/formalin (70 mL) mixed solvent], catalyst bed
(800 mg) in a SUS tube (100 mm × ϕ5), temp (363 K), flow
rate (0.04 mL·min–1).

Conclusions
In summary, direct hydroxymethylation of furfural
to HMF proceeded
smoothly with the highest values of 43.1% yield and 57.5% selectivity
in the presence of Amberlyst-15 in a batch reactor system. This catalytic
system was reusable and applicable for other transformations of C5
to C6 furaldehydes under mild conditions. In addition, such sulfuric
functionalized resin-catalyzed direct hydroxymethylation of furaldehydes
successfully occurred in a liquid-flow reactor system with good performance.
These achievements are expected to open new avenues for inedible biomass
utilization to produce highly valuable chemicals not only in the area
of academic investigations but also in industrial studies.

Experimental
Section
The reaction was conducted in a Schlenk flask attached
with a condenser.
As the general procedure, first, 37% aqueous formaldehyde solution
(stabilized with 5–10% methanol; Wako Pure Chemical Inds. Ltd.)
(5 mL) and solid catalyst (200 mg) were mixed well under vigorous
stirring (500 rpm) at 363 K. Then, furfural (1 mmol) without pretreatment
was introduced into the mixture to initiate the target reaction. After
12 h, the catalyst was filtered off using a syringe filter (0.20 μm;
Milex). The filtrate was analyzed using HPLC equipped with an RI detector.
Columns were used for furfural/HMF and furoic acid/HMFCA (eluent:
10 mM H2SO4 aq, Aminex HPX-87H; Bio-Rad Laboratories
Inc.) and furfuryl alcohol/BHMF and furfurylamine/HMFA reactions (eluent:
10 vol % acetonitrile aq, RSpak DE-413L; Shodex). A GC–flame
ionization detector (GC-2014; Shimadzu) and/or GC–TOFMS (JEOL;
AccuTOF GCx) equipped with a nonpolar column (DB-1; Agilent J&W)
were also used (in part). Conversion and yield values were estimated
with the standard lines adjusted by each reference compound. After
the reaction, the catalyst was centrifuged, washed with deionized
water (1 L), and dried at 383 K overnight before each recycling run
for 12 h. It is noteworthy that the reaction condition for each recycling
run was the same as the initial condition because the sulfuric functionalized
resin catalyst of Amberlyst-15 could be recovered without a significant
loss in weight.

The liquid flow reaction was performed using
a simple flow reactor
system (MCR-1000; EYELA). Further information is presented in the Supporting Information (see Tables S4 and S5).

Water adsorption isotherm at 298 K was obtained by using BELSORP-max
(BEL Japan, Inc.). The samples (0.09 g) were pretreated at 383 K for
2 h under vacuum before measurement.

b Efficiency of formaldehyde at

hydroxymethylation was hardly estimated by HPLC owing to its high

c Considering the activation–deactivation
effect onto the fifth position derived from the electron donating–withdrawing
group at the second position of the furan ring, −CHO, and −COOH
are expected to contribute more to the lower yield rather than −CH2OH and −CH2NH2 functionalities.
However, the order in yield was not considerable in relation to this
basic phenomenon.

d Detailed
information is presented
in Table S4.

e According to our previous report,47 we tentatively investigated the water wettability
of Amberlyst-15 and Amberlyst-46 by using H2O adsorption
isotherm measurement (see Figure S7). Because
the Amberlyst-46 possessed more hydrophobic nature than Amberlyst-15,
it would be expected that surface properties such as hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity
will play a crucial role in the direct hydroxymethylation of furaldehydes
with aqueous formaldehyde over a sulfuric functionalized resin catalyst.
