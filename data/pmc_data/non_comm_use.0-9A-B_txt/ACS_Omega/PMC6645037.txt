Hydrogen-bonding-induced
ordered assembly of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s
derivatives bearing carboxylic acid groups has been investigated from
diluted and concentrated solutions to solid films using ultraviolet–visible
absorption spectroscopy, polarized optical microscopy, and four-point
probe conductivity measurements. In dilute solutions, the polymer
undergoes a spontaneous structural transition from disordered coil-like
to ordered rodlike conformations, which is evidenced by time-dependent
chromism. Many factors such as alkyl-chain length, types of solvents,
and temperature are studied to understand the assembly behavior. Transition
kinetics of the assembly process reveals a universal second-order
rate law, indicating an intermolecular origin due to hydrogen bonding.
When more concentrated, hydrogen bonding drives nematic liquid-crystalline
gelation above a critical concentration and the gels are thermally
reversible. Under an appropriate balance of mechanical and thermal
stresses, uniform liquid-crystalline monodomains are obtained through
the application of a mechanical shear force. The dried films made
from the sheared solutions display both optical and electrical anisotropies,
with a more than 200% increase in charge transport parallel to the
direction of shear as opposed to that in the perpendicular one.

Introduction
Conjugated
polymers (CPs) represent a class of semiconducting materials
garnering extensive applications in flexible optoelectronic devices,
comprising organic photovoltaics (OPVs), organic field-effect transistors,
and polymer light-emitting diodes.1−4 A complication concerning the fabrication
of such high-performance CP devices is the dependence of their optical
and charge-transport characteristics on nanoscale morphology and macroscopic
alignment.5,6 Importantly, CPs exhibit a unique anisotropy
of optoelectronic properties resulting from one-dimensional p-orbital
overlaps along the backbone.5,7−10 When nonlinear, these backbone arrangements will broaden the electronic
density of states, resulting in obstructed charge mobility through
diminished electronic couplings.11 As such,
the capacity to controlling macroscopic alignment in CP thin films
is a key constituent to producing high-performance optoelectronic
devices.12 Although established techniques,
such as spin-coating, produce CP films with highly crystalline domains,
the control of CP microstructures in solution has also been found
to effect solid-state morphology.13 Furthermore,
various processes have been implemented to control alignment in CP
thin films, including mechanical rubbing, nanoimprinting, using prepatterned
substrates, and the Langmuir–Blodgett technique.5,14,15 Interestingly, CPs with the capacity
of hydrogen bonding have been found to assist in the bulk heterojunction
morphology of OPVs.16 However, how these
hydrogen bonding effects influence the solution self-assembly of CPs
has yet to be reported.

Poly(3-alkylthiophenes) (P3ATs) are
an extensively investigated
class of CPs owing to their charge carrier mobility and low band gaps.17−19 These characteristics result from the alignment of polymer backbones,
promoting charge transport through highly crystalline solid states.20 Factors such as solvent choice, solution temperature,
and side-chain architecture have all been found to influence the self-assembled
alignment of P3AT backbones.21−23 Although the so-called coil-to-rod
conformation transition has been proposed to explain such self-organizations,
the dynamics of this transition, with respect to intramolecular versus
intermolecular origin, remains ambiguous.24 In our previous work, the supramolecular complexation of quaternary
ammonium surfactants with poly(3-potassium-6-hexanoatethiophene)-2,5-diyl
(P3K6T), a P3AT derivative, resulted in a dynamic coil-to-rod transition
of intramolecular origin due to the long hydrocarbon side chains of
surfactants.25,26 In contrast, intermolecular associations
leading to polymer backbone coplanarity have been reported for the
solution crystallization of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT).27,28 Although side-chain functionality is known to have an effect on
the solution-based assembly of P3ATs, how hydrogen-bonded moieties
influence the coil-to-rod transition remains unknown.

Recently,
new methods have been explored to improve charge transport
in optoelectronic devices on basis of the self-assembly of lyotropic
liquid crystals (LCs).11,29−31 Importantly,
the promotion of smectic, columnar, and nematic LC phases is driven
through the presence of rigid, high-aspect-ratio microstructures.32,33 As the concentration of the rodlike particle solution increases,
the rotational component of entropy is minimized. To counteract this
effect, the rodlike particles pack more efficiently to exclude solvent
volume, minimizing the overall free energy of the system and forming
the LC phase. In this way, ordered LC domains that span over hundreds
of micrometers may be generated in thin films constructed from dilute
rodlike particle solutions.34 Moreover,
the alignment of LC domains that span even greater length scales may
be achieved through external influences, such as mechanical shearing
and electric or magnetics fields.35,36 There have
been reports on the nematic LC phase in CP gels, and they are surmised
to result from the presence of short-range interactions, such as those
provided through hydrogen-bonded pendant groups.37 Additionally, the incorporation of these moieties supports
thermally reversible cross-linking within the polymer matrix, enhancing
plasticity of the gel and allowing for ease of alignment processes.38 Moreover, gelation of CPs has been reported
to improve charge transport due to the formation of interconnected
three dimensional (3-D) networks.39 Therefore,
the capacity to fostering hydrogen-bonded rodlike microstructures
of P3AT solutions may provide a modest method for constructing 3-D
gel networks of LC conjugated polymers with enhanced anisotropy.

In this work, we report on the assembly processing of carboxylic
acid-functionalized poly(3-alkylthiophene)s from dilute and concentrated
solutions to the solid state. In the dilute regime, the coil-to-rod
transition is spectroscopically investigated as a function of alkyl-chain
length, solvent choice, and temperature. When concentrated, the samples
exhibit thermally reversible gelation accompanied by isotropic-to-LC
phase transitions. We put forward arguments that explain quantitatively
how hydrogen bonding as a strong intermolecular interaction influences
the kinetics laws of the coil-to-rod transition and LC gelation. A
balancing of mechanical and thermal stresses is noted to have an effect
on the LC textures. Through the application of a mechanical shearing
force, aligned films are obtained and preserved through the drying
process. A significant anisotropy of optical and electrical properties
in the aligned films is obtained. We believe these methodologies show
promise in combining the alignment capabilities of LC phases with
the processing potential of CP gels, allowing for a probable pathway
to the construction of flexible high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Results
and Discussion
Diluted Solutions
The regioregular
poly[3-(5-carboxyalkyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl]s,
denoted P3CnTs (Figure 1), were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
and diluted to a concentration of 25 μg/mL. The samples were
left to equilibrate for 80 min. Figure 2 displays the UV–vis absorption spectra of P3CnTs in pure DMSO. Broad Gaussian-like absorption peaks are
observed for both P3C3T and P3C4T with λmax’s
of 442 and 464 nm, respectively. In contrast, the absorption of P3C6T
exhibits two peaks with narrow half-widths at 590 and 550 nm, corresponding
to I0–0abs and I0–1abs vibronic transitions,
respectively.40 These fine structures correspond
to the Franck–Condon progression of C=C stretching within
the thiophene ring.26 Interestingly, the
spectrum of P3C5T presents the broad absorption of both I0–0abs and I0–1abs transitions apparent at 590 and 550 nm, respectively,
and a primary λmax at 500 nm. Therefore, the resulting
spectra of P3CnTs collectively display a distribution
of bathochromic and hypsochromic shifting as a function of alkyl-chain
length. It is well understood that regioregular P3ATs form antico-planar
arrangements of their thiophene rings, promoting rodlike structures
that maximize backbone conjugation and minimize charge traps.21 Conversely, geometric frustrations between adjacent
repeat units are ascribed to the coil-like disorder of the polythiophene
backbone. This leads to defects in backbone conjugation, which manifests
as broad hypsochromic peaks in the electronic spectra. Figure 2 clearly demonstrates that
λmax’s of P3CnTs gradually
red-shift with increasing the length of their side chains, promoting
absorption of vibronic fine structures. This effect may be explained
through the increase of alkyl-chain sterics between thiophene rings,
in which longer side chains force coplanarity of the polymer backbone,
encouraging π–π stacking and increased conjugation
lengths.41 These findings are consistent
with the theoretical calculations, suggesting that ordered crystalline
structures and enhanced conjugation lengths may be achieved through
the incorporation of long alkyl chains.42 Additionally, the absorption spectra of P3CnTs
dissolved in DMSO have been reported previously.43 Although our results show consistency with the literature
values, a notable exception can be observed in the absorption of P3C5T,
which displayed diminished vibronic bands in the cited work.43 The disparity between the vibronic fine structures
of P3C5T may be justified by the 80 min equilibration time implemented
in our study. This suggests that a time-dependent chromism is present
in the absorption spectrum of P3C5T.25,26

carbons.

Previous reports of numerous
P3AT systems have shown that their
self-organization may be promoted through the addition of a poor or
marginal solvent.44 In this way, unfavorable
interactions between the polymer chains and poor solvent molecules
drive self-assembly and aggregation.44 As
such, the degree of assembly should be dependent on the amount of
poor solvent present in the system. Figure 3a demonstrates such self-organizations of
P3C5T upon initial dilution (t = 0 min) in varying
ratios of DMSO/EtOH. In pure DMSO (10:0), P3C5T displays a Gaussian-like
λmax at 460 nm and lacks vibronic fine structures,
similar to those in P3C3T and P3C4T. Upon dilution of P3C5T in smaller
ratios of DMSO/EtOH, the spectra gradually exhibit more red-shifted
λmax’s accompanied by strongly absorbed vibronic
structures at 550 and 590 nm. At lower ratios, the I0–0abs shifts slightly to higher wavelengths.
These observations imply that the addition of EtOH enhances π–π
stacking between the thiophene rings, thereby promoting aggregation
and extended conjugation lengths. Figure 3b shows the spectra of P3C5T dissolved in
various ratios of DMSO/EtOH after storage in the dark for 24 h. In
all cases, little to no pronounced Gaussian-like peak is observed
at around 460 nm. Additionally, more pronounced absorption is detected
for vibronic structures in the 550–600 nm range. This infers
that greater assembly is upheld with time and that all solutions of
P3C5T in mixed solvents display time-dependent spectroscopic transitions.

of P3C5T in varying ratios of DMSO/EtOH. The concentration of solutions
is approximately 25 μg/mL.

Whereas the addition of marginal solvent to solutions of
P3C5T
in DMSO yields an enhancement of backbone coplanarity, the thermochromism
of P3ATs has been reported to decrease the conjugation length.45 Solutions of P3C5T in both pure DMSO and 8:2
DMSO/EtOH displayed broad Gaussian-like peaks in their UV–vis
spectra upon initial dilution (Figure 3a). As such, the thermochromistic transition of these
solutions was investigated, and the results are presented in Figure 4. With increasing
temperature, P3C5T in both pure DMSO and 8:2 DMSO/EtOH shows decreased
absorption of vibronic structures at 550 and 590 nm. Additionally,
the blue-shifting of λmax’s steadily track
with temperature rise, resulting in Gaussian-like peaks at, or higher
than, 50 °C. These results signify that high temperatures cause
polythiophene chains to twist and distort into coil-like conformations
that maximize the overall entropy.26,45 When temperatures
are decreased below a critical value, the polymer chains reorganize
to form rodlike structures that minimize the total free energy. Moreover,
P3C5T in DMSO lacks any presence of vibronic structures at the highest
experimental temperature (80 °C). This is in contrast to P3C5T
in 8:2 DMSO/EtOH, which shows slight absorptions around 590–600
nm under the same conditions.

μg/mL.

To attain a deeper understanding
of the physical mechanism surrounding
P3CnT self-assembly, solutions of P3C5T in DMSO and
8:2 DMSO/EtOH were chosen for time-dependent spectroscopic studies. Figure 5a,b shows the room-temperature
time-dependent spectroscopic properties of P3C5T in DMSO and 8:2 DMSO/EtOH,
respectively. Over time, the solutions gradually red-shift from their
initial Gaussian-like 480–490 nm λmax to a
broad peak accompanied by vibronic structures at 550 and 590 nm. The
existence of a clear isosbestic point is observed in both solutions,
confirming the presence of two coexisting phases; in this case, they
are coil-like disordered and rodlike ordered states associated with
hypsochromic and bathochromic shifts, respectively.25,26,46 Previous reports of P3AT systems indicate
that such vibronic peaks at λ = 590 nm are associated with the
quantity of rodlike structures in solution.25,27,28 As such, the method of initial rates was
employed to measure the kinetics of the P3C5T solution assembly.47 In this way, the initial slope of absorbance
(λ = 590 nm) against aging time is accepted as the initial rate
of the spectroscopic transition. From a theoretical standpoint, the
scaling relationship between the transition rate and concentration
is codified as R ∝ Cn, where R is the rate of
transition, C is the solution concentration, and n signifies the reaction order, which is solely associated
with the reaction mechanism. Figure 6 shows the kinetics of the P3C5T solution assembly
in DMSO and 8:2 DMSO/EtOH. In this instance, the initial rate scales
with the concentration as R ∝ C2.06±0.12 and R ∝ C2.05±0.05 for P3C5T in pure DMSO and 8:2
DMSO/EtOH, respectively. These results demonstrate no significant
difference between reaction orders of the pure and mixed-solvent P3C5T
solutions. Therefore, no change in the dynamic mechanism of the P3C5T
assembly takes place subsequent to the addition of a poor solvent
although the solubility of P3C5T in the mixed solvents decreases considerably.
Moreover, the second-order kinetics law in this work is in contrast
to the inverse first order in P3AT complexes25,26 and the mixed fractional order in P3HT.27,28

It is understood that
the self-organization mechanism of P3AT assembly
results from both a coil-to-rod conformational transition and adjacent
rod–rod aggregations to form nanofibrils.48 Structurally, such nanofibrils are upheld through the formation
of hairpinlike lamellae that propagate through the back-and-forth
folding of polymer chains. In some cases, the coil-to-rod transition
is thought to be the primary driver for assembly, whereas in others,
rod–rod aggregation dominates.24 Previous reports have shown the solution assembly of P3HT due to
π–π stacking in a marginal solvent to be of a mixed
fractional order, with an exponent of approximately 1.6.27,28 Such results may be explained through secondary nucleation theory,
which states that the growth rate (G) is proportional
to the total nucleation (S), such that G ∝ S.49 As such,
the variations between the growth rates of numerous P3AT systems may
be explained by the total individual contributions of nucleation (Si) from various elementary processes. Therefore,
the total nucleation will result from differing weights of the following
elementary components  where Wi is the
weighing factor determining the intrinsic contribution of each term.
Additionally, each contributor has a fundamental scaling relationship
associated with the physical process it represents. For the only coil-to-rod
transition, our previous work shows kinetics that demonstrates inverse
first-order behavior (Scoil–rod ∝ C–1) in the P3AT supramolecular
complexes.25 For the sole rod–rod
aggregation, scaling establishes a nucleation rate that is proportional
to the concentration raised to the second power (Saggreg ∝ C2).50 In contrast, the chain-folding process reveals
the kinetics of a fractional order. Therefore, the overall kinetics
is determined by the relative contributions of the nuclei of each
primary process. The previous report on a mixed fractional order of
∼1.6 in P3HT demonstrated that the nucleation of π–π
stacking-induced rod–rod aggregation contributed more than
that of coil-to-rod and chain-folding processes.27,28 In this work, the second-order growth kinetics of P3C5T indicates
that the rod–rod aggregation is the main process driving the
solution assembly and the other two processes are negligible. The
discrepancy between the assembly mechanism of P3HT and that of P3C5T
may be explained through variations in their chemical structures.
The carboxylic acid alkyl-chain end group of P3C5T has the potential
to act as both a hydrogen bond donor and an acceptor.51 Accordingly, intermolecular hydrogen bonding is possible
between chains of P3C5T but not between those of P3HT. Such short-range
strong intermolecular interactions may act to accelerate rod–rod
aggregations of P3C5T chains, resulting in the aforementioned second-order
growth kinetics. Moreover, second-order spectrokinetic measurements
have been reported for another P3AT derivative with the potential
for hydrogen bonding.52 The fact that P3C5T
exhibits the second-order kinetics in both DMSO and 8:2 DMSO/EtOH
indicates that hydrogen bonding, when it is present, is a predominant
factor over π–π stacking to control the assembly
process.

Concentrated Solutions
A consequence of conjugated
backbone aggregation influencing the solution assembly of P3C5T is
the formation of hydrogen-bonded 3-D networks at higher concentrations,
leading to a sol–gel transition. Additionally, the use of low-volatility
solvents, similar to DMSO, has been found to promote P3AT gelation.53 The Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra
of P3C5T solid films and gels (30 wt % in DMSO and DMSO/EtOH) were
evaluated to determine the extent of hydrogen bonding (Figure S1, Supporting Information). In both the
solid film and gel, broad bands and sharp peaks are present within
the hydroxyl and carbonyl regions of the FT-IR spectra, respectively.
In this regard, sharp carbonyl peaks are used to evaluate hydrogen
bonding. In the solid state, the carbonyl vibrations present at 1697
cm–1 are indicative of low-energy hydrogen bonding.54 Reports of P3CnT’s have
indicated that carbonyl peak positions at approximately 1735 cm–1 are suggestive of free C=O stretching.54 In the gelated state, P3C5T shows carbonyl peaks
at roughly 1716 cm–1, which suggests that degrees
of hydrogen bonding are present in the gel. As the carbonyl peak shift
in the gel is associated with the strength of hydrogen bonding,54 the higher-energy wavenumber peak indicates
the weaker hydrogen bonding of the gel. Interestingly, redrying of
P3C5T gels shifts carbonyl peaks back to lower-energy wavenumbers,
signifying complete restoration of solid-state hydrogen bonding.

Figure 7 illustrates
the bulk and thermal properties of concentrated P3C5T–DMSO
solutions. In the bulk state, P3C5T solutions maintain fluidity up
to concentrations as high as 15 wt % at room temperature (Figure 7a). Above a critical
concentration (∼21 wt %), the percolation threshold is reached
and the solutions gel. Slight color changes may be observed between
the less-concentrated solutions and the P3C5T gel, providing further
evidence for the formation of an interconnected 3-D network. With
heating, gel films of P3C5T display a color change from dark purple
to bright orange (Figure 7b). Upon cooling back to room temperature, the dark purple
color of the films is gradually restored and fluidity is no longer
present. These observations imply that the gelation process of P3C5T
is thermally reversible and supported through a network of hydrogen-bonding
interactions.38 Moreover, air-drying of
P3C5T produces solid films with a metallic sheen that can be carefully
peeled off from glass substrates.

Figure 7 (a) Bulk and (b) thin-film characteristics
of P3C5T/DMSO thermally
reversible gels. The concentration of thin films is 23 wt %.

Upon sandwiching the P3C5T gel
between a clean glass slide and
a coverslip, the gel exhibits characteristic phenomena related to
birefringent media. When the samples are placed under a polarized
optical microscope (POM), double diffraction is observed in the form
of light and dark contrasting regions. Furthermore, the domains change
alternatively upon rotating the sample through a 45° angle in
between the microscope crossed polarizers. These observations indicate
the construction of a liquid crystal (LC), with Schlieren textures
resembling that of a typical nematic phase.55 Both small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering measurements show
no scattering peaks, indicating no smectic LC phases or crystalline
structures (Figures S2 and S3, Supporting
Information). Figure 8 illustrates the onset of such nematic LC formation as a function
of concentration. The presence of the nematic LC phase suggests that
P3C5T chains maintain rigid rodlike conformations due to their net
anisotropic polarizability.5,37,55 As such, the long-range directional order may be supported in P3C5T
microstructures through parallel alignment of the polymer long axis.25,56 Using the POM approach, the boundary between the isotropic and nematic
LC phases of P3C5T was determined to be 21 ± 1 wt % (Figure 8). Interestingly,
this critical concentration of the nematic LC formation is of the
same order as the threshold of gelation. Thus, the LC gels may form
through a network of interconnected rods supported through short-range
hydrogen bonding.37 It should be noted
that the hydrogen-bonding-induced nematic LC gelation of carboxylated
polythiophenes in this work is different from the hexagonal LC phases
of P3AT complexes without gelation25 and
P3HT gelation without LC phases.39

of P3C5T in DMSO as a function of concentration.
Illustrative optical images of isotropic and liquid-crystalline phases
are displayed above the phase boundary.

In some instances, P3C5T textures of periodic stripes were
observed.
This phenomenon would occur only at low-temperature heating over extended
periods of time (greater than 18 h). Figure 9 demonstrates typical images of the periodic
banded textures extending radially outward from the coverslip’s
center. Such phenomena have been observed with solutions of P3HT in
trichlorobenzene after addition to glass capillaries.57 For P3C5T, the period of a single band is approximately
64 μm (Figure 9b), similar to the periodicity observed in P3HT. We believe these
textures result from a shearing capillary force induced from the sandwiching
of P3C5T between two glass substrates during slow evaporation. As
these textures are not observed consistently, multiple factors including
temperature, humidity, and surface effects may play a key role in
their materialization.57 Further investigation
is warranted in this context.

P3C5T in DMSO at
(a) 5× and (b) 10× magnification showing the periodicity
of P3C5T banded textures.

A sufficiently swollen and oriented P3AT gel can provide
a worthwhile
preliminary material for doping of electrically conductive films.38 Moreover, the presence of the LC phase implies
that enhanced alignment of the P3C5T gel network may be possible.
Estimates of the LC phase boundary and minimum gelation concentration
show both of these values to be of similar order (∼21 wt %).
As a result, any P3C5T solution of high-enough concentration to form
a nematic LC phase will simultaneously form a gel. After heating and
subsequent slow cooling of the P3C5T gel, a shear force was applied
across the still-wet polymeric samples. Figure 10 displays the alignment of P3C5T gelled
thin films in response to an applied mechanical shear force. At the
lowest magnification, POM images of sheared P3C5T thin films illustrate
the existence of planar alignment in the LC domains. When the shear
direction is in line with the crossed polarizers, minimal transmission
intensity is detected through the POM (Figure 10a). After rotation of the microscope stage
by 45°, the transmission intensity of the sample is augmented
(Figure 10b). This
provides significant evidence that the LC director’s azimuthal
angle is not degenerate but rather well-defined over thousands of
micrometers within the substrate plane.

films of gelled P3C5T in DMSO under crossed
polarizers. (a) 0° rotation and (b) 45° rotation of crossed
polarizers. The solution concentration is 23 wt %, and the shear direction
is denoted by the single arrows.

Figure 11 shows
the quantified inplane optical anisotropy of the aligned P3C5T LC
gels. The degree of order inherent in the system was determined through
the distribution symmetry of transmission intensity plots. Through
rotation of the P3C5T films in 15° increments, gradual alterations
of the transmission intensity are observed (Figure 11a). As such, the intensity of these images
is plotted as a function of rotational degrees in Cartesian coordinates
(Figure 11b). The
resultant plot supports an overall Gaussian-like symmetry and displays
minimal transmission intensity with the P3C5T long axis parallel and
perpendicular to the polarizer (0 or 90°). A maximum intensity
is reached at an angle of 45°. These findings are consistent
with previous observations made regarding Figure 10. To further demonstrate the optical anisotropy
of the aligned P3C5T films, transmission intensity plots were constructed
in polar coordinates over a rotational range of 360°. A characteristic
and highly symmetric flower pedal shape is observed (Figure 11C), denoting significant optical
anisotropy of the system.58

the entire range of data shown.

Promotion of LC gelation provides a facile way to foster
the large-area
thin-film alignment of conjugated polymers with enhanced anisotropic
properties for up and coming electronic and energy applications. After
air-drying of the sheared P3C5T gel films, aligned LC monodomains
were maintained. Electrical conductivities of the solid films were
measured at room temperature in a four-point probe configuration. Figure 12 presents I–V curves of P3C5T solid films
and conductivity values with probes parallel and perpendicular to
the shear direction. The slight non-Ohmic behavior of the conductivities
indicates some characteristic of the capacitive interface in the current–voltage
measurements. Directional conductivity measurements of the P3C5T films
demonstrate a clear electronic anisotropy. Careful calculations show
values of the electrical conductivities both parallel and perpendicular
to the direction of shear to be (5.2 ± 1.8) × 10–3 and (2.3 ± 0.8) × 10–3 S/m, respectively.
As the long axis (conjugated backbone) of P3C5T chains is oriented
parallel to the shear direction, greater charge transport is observed
through the intramolecular pathways as opposed to intermolecular hopping
through π–π stacking.25 The error in the conductivity values is associated with instrumental
limitations for measuring film thickness. Nevertheless, the uniformity
in relative film thickness between measurements suggests that the
difference in conductivity between the parallel and perpendicular
orientations is accurate. Moreover, these results show conductivities
comparable to those of P3HT unaligned films at 2.8 × 10–3 S/m.59

Conclusions
In
summary, we have reported on the hydrogen-bonding-directed ordered
assembly of carboxylic acid-functionalized poly(3-alkylthiophene)
derivatives in diluted and concentrated solutions as well as solid
films. In dilute solutions, a combination of good and poor solvents
is found to promote self-assembly from disordered coil-like to ordered
rodlike structures. With increasing temperature, such self-organizations
are thermodynamically hindered, indicating that the solution assembly
process is thermally reversible. Spectroscopic transitions display
second-order growth kinetics, signifying that the solution assembly
involves an intermolecular mechanism promoted through the presence
of hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acid side chains. In concentrated solutions,
hydrogen bonding promotes thermally reversible nematic LC gelation
above a critical concentration. Under an appropriate balance of mechanical
and thermal stresses, mechanical shearing of LC gels induces the alignment
of polymer chains at macroscopic scales. The aligned films display
a significant anisotropy of optical and electrical properties, with
more than 2 times faster charge transport along the backbone alignment
direction compared to that in the perpendicular direction. We believe
our work may provide a facile methodology to combine the alignment
capacity of LCs with the processing potential of conjugated polymer
gels, allowing for the improved production of high-performance electronic
devices.

regioregular (90–95% head-to-tail) poly[3-(5-carboxyhexyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl]
(P3C6T, average MW = 50–60 kg/mol,

(P3C4T, average MW = 30–40 kg/mol,
Rieke Metals Inc.), regioregular (90–95% head-to-tail) poly[3-(5-carboxypropyl)thiophene-2,5-diyl]
(P3C3T, average MW = 15–25 kg/mol,
Rieke Metals Inc.), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, Fisher Scientific),
and ethanol (EtOH, BDH 95% reagent grade) were used as received in
the preparation of stock solutions (2.5 mg/mL, unless otherwise stated).
All samples of the P3CnT stock solutions were first
prepared in DMSO. For dilute samples containing a mixture of DMSO
and EtOH solvents, the stock solution was diluted to an appropriate
concentration in DMSO. The dilute sample was then heated until it
displayed a bright orange color, indicating complete dissolution.
The sample was removed from the heat source and an appropriate amount
of EtOH was added dropwise to the solution.

Characterization
Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR)
spectra of the concentrated solution and solid film samples were gathered
on a Nicolet iS10 FT-IR spectrometer with an attenuated total reflection
mode at a resolution of 4 cm–1 of 1000 scans. Spectroscopic
measurements of dilute solutions were performed on a Cary-Win UV–vis
spectrophotometer. The temperature controller was set to 25 °C,
and the samples were closed from ambient air atmosphere. Typically,
samples were heated to 70 °C in a temperature-controlled water
bath just prior to spectroscopy measurements. The samples were then
quickly transferred and further diluted into a cuvette, which was
preset at 25 °C. LC textures of concentrated solutions were characterized
with a Leica DM2500P polarized optical microscope (POM). A Leica ICC50
high definition video camera was used to capture the images, and ImageJ
software was used to process the transmission intensities. To prepare
LC textured samples, a small aliquot of the concentrated solution
was cast onto a clean glass slide. A coverslip was then applied atop
the sample. To induce polymer alignment, a small aliquot of the LC
solution was cast onto a clean glass slide. A coverslip was then applied
on top of the sample with minimal pressure. The glass slide was then
placed on a Linkam LTS420 hot stage. The hot stage was programmed
using Linksys32 software to control the temperature. The sample was
then heated to 80 °C at a rate of 5 °C/min or until a color
change from dark purple to orange was observed. The sample was left
to equilibrate under these conditions for 10 min. Cooling of the sample
to room temperature was performed at a rate of 5 °C/min. A color
change from orange to dark purple was observed, and the sample was
then quickly removed from the hot stage and rapidly sheared at a high
moving speed. Room-temperature conductivity measurements of dried
films (∼3 μm thickness) were carried out on a Keithley
Instrument 2400 SourceMeter in a four-point probe configuration. Voltage
sweeps were run in triplicate, with the average of the sweeps being
taken as the slope of their respective I–V curves.
