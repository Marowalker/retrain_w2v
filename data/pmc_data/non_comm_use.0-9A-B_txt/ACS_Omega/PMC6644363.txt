Hydrodeoxygenation process is a potential
route for upgrading biofuel
intermediates, like vanillin, which is obtained in huge quantities
through the chemical treatment of the abundant lignocellulosic biomass
resources of nature, and this is attracting increasing attentions
over the years. Herein, we report the grafting of palladium nanoparticles
at the surface of porous organic polymer Pd-PDVTTT-1 synthesized through
the co-condensation of 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione and divinylbenzene
in the presence of radical initiator under solvothermal reaction conditions.
The Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has been characterized thoroughly by powder
X-ray diffraction, nitrogen sorption, ultra-high-resolution transmission
electron Microscopy, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, 13C MAS NMR, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses.
High surface area together with good thermal stability of the Pd-PDVTTT-1
material has motivated us to explore its potential as heterogeneous
catalyst in the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin for the production
of upgraded biofuel 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol in almost quantitative
yield and high selectivity (94%).

1 Introduction
Gradual
decay of fossil fuel resources is a major concern of the
21st century for which the sustainable and innovative technologies
for the conversion of renewable biomass into liquid fuels and chemicals
are highly desirable.1,2 Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO),3,4 aqueous phase reforming,5 and catalytic
cracking6 are the key chemical routes for
the generation of biofuel from the abundant lignocellulosic biomass.
Catalytic HDO reaction typically leads to byproducts with less amount
of oxygen along with the introduction of greater thermal and chemical
stability7 of the products. Biofuel products
obtained by using this catalytic HDO route can provide significant
yields, and they offer lower CO2 emissions upon combustion.
Among all biosources, from wood-based biomass, the lignin content
is over 30% and this is most abandoned in nature. Lignin can be depolymerized
through chemical or biological cofermentation.8 Various components of pyrolyzed oil that are obtained from lignin
can be efficiently summed up for biofuel production. Thus, biofuel
upgradation to liquid fuel for transportation by HDO is considered
to be the most effective and feasible strategy compared with other
methods like hydrogenolysis, decarbonylation, decarboxylation, and
dehydration.9 Vanillin (4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde)
is one such component, having three different oxygenated functional
groups (aldehyde, ether, and hydroxyl), and it is produced in huge
quantities through the chemical treatment of these lignocellulosic
biomass. Vanillin can be selectively hydrogenated into 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol
(MMP), which is an indispensable future biofuel.10 However, vanillin hydrogenation usually requires high pressure
of hydrogen and high temperature, which always facilitates the formation
of byproduct 4-hydroxymethyl-2-methoxyphenol (HMP) as a result of
incomplete hydrogenation.

Today several strategies have been
brought forward in designing
the supported metal nanostructured materials as heterogeneous catalyst
for this HDO reaction.11 Platinum,12 palladium,13 ruthenium,14,15 and rhodium16-based nanocatalysts showed
high efficiency in upgrading vanillin via HDO. However, limited supply
of these precious metal catalysts is always a major obstacle for these
catalysts. This has motivated the researchers to develop the next
generation heterogeneous catalysts for successful hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin. Nitrogen-containing high-surface-area porous nanomaterials
found to be a very effective support, where palladium can be grafted
at the pore surfaces for these organic transformations.17−19 Owing to their tremendous potential in catalysis, a wide range of
porous organic polymers (POPs)20 including
crystalline triazine-based frameworks,21 conjugated microporous polymers,22 microporous
polymers,23 polymers of intrinsic microporosity,24 porous aromatic frameworks,25 etc. are intensively studied over the years. These POPs
are largely synthesized through the polycondensation of a wide range
of organic building blocks, and these materials possess large specific
surface area, high thermal and mechanical stability, and good framework
flexibility.26 Furthermore, porous organic
polymers bearing nitrogen-rich functionalities, like triazine, carbazole,
amine, imine, and amide units, are efficiently utilized as heterogeneous
catalysts for various organic transformations.27,28 Because of high thermal and chemical stability, POPs can withstand
the exposure of chemically unstable media and wet phase without disturbing
their pore architecture.

Herein, we report the synthesis of
a new N-rich porous organic
polymer PDVTTT-1 through the co-polymerization of divinylbenzene and
1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione monomers under solvothermal
reaction conditions (Scheme 1). Since this nitrogen-rich polymeric framework exhibits high
specific surface area, palladium NPs are grafted at the surface of
the porous polymer through impregnation of Pd0 from Pd(II)
solution in the presence of a reducing agent. This Pd-grafted porous
polymer has been utilized as a heterogeneous catalyst for hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin (a model system) for upgrading biofuels, which can be
efficiently derived from lignin-based biomass.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 X-ray Diffraction Analysis
The wide-angle
powder X-ray diffraction patterns of PDVTTT-1 and Pd-PDVTTT-1 are
shown in Figure 1a,b,
respectively. As seen from Figure 1a, the broad peak appeared at the 2θ value of
18–20°, which suggested the amorphous nature of the polymeric
material. Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material,
as shown in Figure 1b, displayed four peaks at 2θ values of 39.76, 46.31, 67.69,
and 81.26°. These peaks could be assigned to the Pd(111), Pd(200),
Pd(220), and Pd(311) face-centered cubic (fcc) crystal planes of metallic
palladium nanoparticles.29 Thus, this powder
XRD data suggested successful loading of palladium nanoparticles at
the surface of the porous organic polymer in PDVTTT-1.

samples.

2.2 Surface
Area and Pore Size Measurement
To analyze the surface area
and porosity of the POPs, nitrogen adsorption–desorption
analysis has been carried out at 77 K. Figure 2a represents the nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms of PDVTTT-1, which can be classified as a mixture of type
I and type IV with a very small hysteresis loop. The initial uptake
of N2 in the low pressure region (0.02–0.20 P/P0) indicates the microporous
nature of the material, and a very small hysteresis loop at the high
pressure region (0.80–0.99 P/P0) suggested the existence of interparticle porosity throughout
the polymeric matrix.30 The nitrogen adsorption–desorption
isotherms, as observed in Figure 2b, can be classified as typical type I, corresponding
to the microporous nature of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material.31 The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface
area of these two materials PDVTTT-1 and Pd-PDVTTT-1 were 598 and
455 m2/g, respectively. The estimated pore volumes of PDVTTT-1
and Pd-PDVTTT-1 samples were 0.3399 and 0.2201 cm3 g−1, respectively. To measure the pore size distribution
nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) method was employed. The
pore size distributions for PDVTTT-1 and Pd-PDVTTT-1 materials have
been estimated from their respective N2 sorption isotherms’
suggested peak pore size of 1.5 and 1.4 nm, respectively. This result
suggested reduction of pore size and surface area after the grafting
of Pd NPs at the POP surface.

of PDVTTT-1
(a) and Pd-PDVTTT-1 (b). (B) Respective pore size distribution plots
of PDVTTT-1 (a) and Pd-PDVTTT-1 (b).

2.3 Spectroscopic Analysis
To determine
the various organic functionalities as well as chemical bonding in
the polymeric framework, the Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopic
analysis of the Pd-PDVTTT-1 has been carried out. Figure 3 represents the FTIR spectrum
of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material, where the sharp signals at 2924 and 2848
cm–1 could be assigned to CH2 and C–H
stretching vibrations, respectively.32 The
characteristic peak at 1702 cm–1 could be assigned
to the triazine ring containing carbonyl group. The peak at 1604 cm–1 is observed due to the presence of benzene moiety
in the material framework. Further, two characteristic peaks appearing
at 1374 and 1049 cm–1 are attributed to the existence
of allyl-substituted triazine moiety in the polymeric matrix.33 The distinctive strong signal is noticed at
1449 cm–1 due to the aliphatic C–H bending
vibration, and two other peaks appearing at 798 and 711 cm–1 are assigned to the presence of out-of-plane bending vibrations
of aromatic C–H bond.

Figure 3 FTIR spectrum of Pd-PDVTTT-1 sample.

On the other hand, solid-state 13C MAS
NMR spectrum
of the material has been recorded to understand about the chemical
environment of different carbon centers in the porous polymer matrix. Figure 4 represents the solid-state 13C MAS NMR spectrum of PDVTTT-1 polymer, where the triazine
ring containing carbonyl carbon appeared at a chemical shift of 213.7
ppm and three characteristic signals at 152.7, 144.0, and 130.2 ppm
are observed due to the presence of benzene ring containing carbons.
The signal at 108.3 ppm indicated the unreacted olefins in the material.3113C chemical shifts at 85.3, 75.6,
66.2, 49.6, 39.8, 28.2, and 15.7 ppm could be attributed to the different
chemical environment of aliphatic carbon centers in PDVTTT-1. Thus,
this 13C CP MAS spectrum suggested the formation of porous
polymer framework due to successful co-condensation of the monomers.

for different carbon atoms are marked in the inset model.

2.4 XPS Analysis
To
evaluate the elemental
composition as well as the oxidation state of supported Pd nanoparticles
in the polymeric matrix, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic analysis
of Pd-PDVTTT-1 has been performed. Figure 5a,b represents the narrow-range XPS spectra
of palladium, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon atoms, whereas Figure 6 represents the full-range
XPS spectrum of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material. The XPS spectrum of Pd exhibited
two peaks with binding energy values of 335.0 and 340.1 eV, corresponding
to Pd 3d5/2 and Pd 3d3/2, respectively. It is
noticed that the binding energy values are slightly changed in comparison
to those of Pd(0) state.34 Thus, the high-resolution
XPS spectrum of the Pd 3d matched well with that of Pd 3d of Pd(0),
which is in good agreement with the existence of metallic Pd0 species bound at the surface of the polymer framework. The amount
of Pd loading in the polymer material has been estimated to be 2.28
wt % by employing CASA software. In Figure 6, full-range XPS spectrum of the material
has been demonstrated, where N 1s, C 1s, and O 1s components are present
with the binding energies of 399.1, 284.4, and 532.3 eV, respectively.

XPS spectra of Pd-PDVTTT-1 containing elements Pd
3d (a), N 1s (b), C 1s (c), and O 1s (d).

2.5 Microscopic
Analysis
The high-resolution
transmission electron microscopic image of the Pd-PDVTTT-1 material
is shown in Figure 7. As seen from this figure, 2.0–3.0 nm size very small palladium
nanoparticles are spread uniformly over the surface of the polymer
material. Further, micropores having average pore diameter of 1.4
nm are seen throughout the specimen of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material. Thus,
this electron microscopic result agrees well with the independent
N2 sorption analysis.

microscopy images of
Pd-PDVTTT-1 at different parts of the specimen (a, b).

2.6 Thermal Stability
Thermogravimetric
(TG) analysis has been carried out to determine the thermal stability
of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material in the temperature range of 25–700
°C. Figure S1a (Supporting Information)
represents the thermogravimetric analysis profile diagram, where the
first weight loss starts from 290 to 395 °C due to the decomposition
of organic functional group of the polymeric framework. The second
weight loss up to 700 °C temperature could be attributed to the
burning of the residual part of the material. So, the TG/DTA result
suggested that the Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has high thermal stability.
The carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents in the PDVTTT-1 polymeric
framework were obtained experimentally, where C = 80.24%, H = 7.34%,
and N = 6.83%. This elemental analysis result matches well with the
theoretically calculations, where C = 81.00%, H = 7.14%, N = 5.45%,
and O = 6.23%, as obtained from the stoichiometry of the framework
of PDVTTT-1.

2.7 Basicity Measurement
Temperature-programmed
desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) has been performed
in the temperature range of 25–600 °C to measure the surface
basic sites of the PDVTTT-1 polymer. The CO2-TPD desorption
profile of the sample was recorded by raising the temperature at a
ramp of 5 °C/min using a thermal conductivity detector (TCD).
As shown in Figure S2 (Supporting Information),
two peaks are observed at 75 and 206 °C temperature in the TCD
signal vs temperature profile diagram. These peaks could be assigned
due to weak and strong basic sites, respectively, which can bind CO2 molecules at the Pd-PDVTTT-1 surface. From the area under
the desorption peak, the total strength of the basic sites has been
estimated and this was 1.057 mmol g−1.

2.8 Catalytic Activity
The catalytic
efficiency of the Pd catalyst was investigated in the hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin. The schematic route for the hydrogenation of vanillin
to MMP and HMP is shown in Scheme 2. At first, the reaction was carried out in Teflon-lined
autoclave with 1 MPa H2 pressure. The progress of the reaction
was monitored by using gas chromatography (Varian GC-430) equipped
with a flame ionization detector with a comparison of the chromatographic
peak position with the known standards. After 5 h, when the gas chromatographic
analysis was carried out with the filtrate, 36% conversion was noticed
and HMP was found as the major product along with ∼8% MMP.
After 12 h, GC analysis revealed the conversion has increased with
the formation of MMP as the major product. Thus, it was concluded
that with time, the selectivity of the product changes due to hydrogenolysis
of vanillin alcohol. So, we decide to optimize the reaction time,
temperature, H2 pressure, and amount of catalyst.

Scheme 2 Hydrogenation
of Vanillin to MMP and HMP over Pd-PDVTTT-1 Catalyst
At first, the reaction was carried out without
using catalyst.
Even after 15 h, there was no conversion of vanillin. Then, the reaction
was carried out with the support material only (35 mg of PDVTTT-1).
In this case also, no conversion was observed. Thus, it can be concluded
that the Pd NPs are necessary to carry out this HDO reaction. Then,
we have carried out the reactions with different amounts of catalysts.
Thirty-five milligrams of the supported Pd catalyst in the presence
of other optimized reactants was best suited for the reaction because
it resulted in the highest conversion of vanillin together with maximum
selectivity of MMP. We have also tested some other supported catalysts,
such as Pd-SBA-15 and commercially available Pd/C catalyst, to check
the effect of support on the reaction. It has been observed that the
non-nitrogenous supports are relatively less effective for this reaction
compared with nitrogen-containing supports. In a suitable nitrogen-containing
support, there is formation of electron-enriched Pd species in the
catalyst, which is more active than Pd nanoparticles supported over
N-free support materials.

The effect of H2 pressure
plays a key role in the hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin. The conversion was very poor at low H2 pressure
(<0.3 MPa). When the H2 pressure was gradually increased
to 0.5 MPa, the conversion of vanillin was also increased. At 0.8
MPa of H2 pressure, 80% conversion of vanillin together
with high selectivity for 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (84%) was observed.
Finally, at 1 MPa of H2 pressure, 92% of conversion was
observed for vanillin with 94% product selectivity for 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol
(MMP). After optimization of the amount of catalyst and H2 pressure needed for the reaction, we approached time optimization.
Within 8 h, 48% of the vanillin was converted and vanillin alcohol
(4-hydroxymethyl-2-methoxyphenol, HMP) was the major product (58%).
The reaction was further carried out for further 6 h. The vanillin
conversion was observed to be 88%. 2-Methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP)
was found as the major product with 84% selectivity. Selectivity of
vanillin alcohol was thus decreased. As MMP is more valuable as biofuel
than HMP, the reaction was further carried out for a longer time to
get 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol with better selectivity. Finally, after
16 h, 97% of conversion was observed for vanillin with 94% product
selectivity for MMP. Here, HMP was obtained as a byproduct (6% selectivity).
The progress of the reaction was monitored by analyzing the reaction
mixture through a GC. Generally, the hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin
to 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol can proceed in two ways. First, vanillin
can be hydrogenated to HMP, and then it is further hydrogenated to
MMP. In another way, direct hydrogenolysis of the C=O may occur
to give MMP. In our case, at first, hydrogenation of vanillin to HMP
occurred and then the resulting HMP undergoes further hydrogenation
and elimination of water to give MMP. At low temperatures (25–45
°C), very low conversion of vanillin was observed. High conversion
of vanillin was observed on raising the temperature progressively
beyond 80 °C. At 100 °C, more than 70% conversion was found.
At 130 °C, a very good conversion of 85% was seen, and finally
at 150 °C, an excellent conversion of 97% was observed together
with 94% selectivity for MMP. Thus, 150 °C is the optimized reaction
temperature for this HDO reaction over Pd-PDVTTT-1.

The effect
of solvent on hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin was also
examined under similar reaction conditions. Solvents like tetrahydrofuran
(THF), ethyl acetate, cyclohexane, and dimethyl formamide did not
serve as appropriate solvents for this reaction and produced very
poor to little conversion. When water was used as solvent for the
hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin, quite good conversion was observed
from the beginning. In 8 h time, nearly 48% conversion was observed,
although at that time, the major product was vanillin alcohol. As
satisfactory conversion could be obtained with water only, we continued
the reaction for many hours to achieve better conversion of vanillin
and also to get our target product 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP)
in good yield with excellent selectivity. We have compared our catalyst
with other Pd-supported catalysts, such as Pd/MSMF,35 Pd/CN0.132,36 Pd/SO3H-MIL-101,37 and Pd@NH2-UiO-66.38 Our experimental results suggested
that palladium nanoparticles are highly dispersed throughout the surface
of this porous organic polymer. Here, Pd NPs are tightly bounded with
the nitrogen atoms present in the framework of the porous polymer.
Excess nitrogen sites in the material could help electron enrichment
at the surface of Pd-PDVTTT-1. Electron-enriched supported palladium
nanoparticles also showed high catalytic activity for the hydrogenation
of vanillin.39 Electron-enriched supported
palladium nanoparticles could be responsible for high selectivity
of MMP through the vanillin HDO process. N-rich material surfaces
also improve the catalyst wettability in water. Thus, the contact
of the substrates with the catalyst also increases, which ultimately
gives better conversion. Further, Pd0 impregnated on cubic
mesoporous KIT-6 although showed 98% conversion of vanillin at 300
°C reaction in a vapor-phase down flow fixed-bed reactor for
6 h. But the reaction temperature is too high, and p-cresol is predominately formed in this upgradation process together
with a small amount of vanillyl alcohol.40 Thus, the nature of immobilized Pd0 species together
with the nature of the support plays a crucial role in the upgradation
of vanillin to the value-added biofuel product MMP.

2.9 Reusability Test
For supported heterogeneous
catalysts,41−43 recycling efficiency is very crucial to ensure the
chemical and thermal stability of the catalyst as well as for sustainable
operation. We have reused the Pd-PDVTTT-1 catalyst for five consecutive
cycles in HDO of vanillin. Initially, 35 mg of catalyst was employed
for the HDO reaction under the optimized reaction condition and 97%
conversion was achieved. Thereafter, the catalyst was removed by centrifugation
and it was washed with methanol and dried in an oven at 80 °C
for 6 h. This recovered catalyst was used for the next run under optimized
reaction conditions. Similarly, we have performed total five catalytic
cycles and corresponding product yields are shown in Figure 8. As seen from this figure,
conversion of vanillin has been decreased by only 4.8% after five
reaction cycles. This result suggested high recycling efficiency of
Pd-PDVTTT-1 in the HDO of vanillin.

Figure 8 Recycling efficiency of Pd-PDVTTT-1 catalyst
in the HDO of vanillin.

2.10 Leaching Test
To investigate the
heterogeneity of the material, hot filtration test has been performed.
The hydrodeoxygenation of vanillin (100 mg) was carried out in aqueous
medium (15 mL) under H2 pressure (1 MPa) inside the Teflon-lined
reactor for 16 h at 150 °C temperature using 35 mg of the Pd
catalyst. Then, the solution was filtered immediately during hot conditions
to check if any Pd was being leached out from the solid support to
the solution. Then, the same reaction was carried out using the filtrate
for another 4 h. We could not observe any improvement of product yield
before and after this hot filtration test. Thus, it can be concluded
that Pd species could not be leached out from the porous polymer support
and heterogeneity of Pd-PDVTTT-1 material has been retained.

3 Conclusions
Palladium NPs are supported over nitrogen-rich
porous organic polymer
synthesized through the co-condensation of 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione and divinylbenzene
under solvothermal reaction conditions. Both the parent porous polymer
as well as its Pd-embedded analogue showed very high surface areas
together with high chemical and mechanical stability. Because of the
high loading of Pd0 NPs at the surface of the porous organic
polymer and their fine dispersion throughout the organic matrix, they
act as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the selective hydrodeoxygenation
of vanillin to upgraded biofuel product 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol.
This study could encourage the researchers in developing supported
Pd-catalysts based on N-rich porous polymers and exploring their catalytic
activity for the biofuel upgradation via metal-mediated transfer hydrogenation
process.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials
Divinylbenzene (Mw = 130.19 g/mol)
and 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione (Mw = 249.27 g/mol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
India. Radical initiator azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN; Mw = 164.21 g/mol) was obtained from SRL, India, and this
was used after recrystallization. All organic solvents were obtained
from Merck, India.

4.2 Synthesis of Porous Organic
Polymer (PDVTTT-1)
The porous organic polymer PDVTTT-1 was
synthesized under solvothermal
reaction conditions. In a typical synthesis, 0.004 mol divinylbenzene
and 0.001 mol 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione were reacted through
radical co-polymerization in the presence of azobisisobutyronitrile
(AIBN) as a radical initiator. Initially, divinylbenzene was dissolved
in 15 mL of dry acetone and then 1,3,5-triallyl-1,3,5-triazine-2,4,6-(1H,3H,5H)-trione was added
to it and allowed to stir continuously for 30 min. To make inert atmosphere
inside the whole system, nitrogen gas was purged continuously through
the reaction mixture. Then, 25 mg of recrystallized AIBN was added
to the solution mixture in one slot and the mixture was subjected
to vigorous stirring for 1 h. Finally, the transparent slurry obtained
in the process was loaded inside the Teflon-lined autoclave and kept
for 24 h at 120 °C temperature. The solid product was collected
by simple filtration technique and washed with acetone five times
to get rid of unreacted starting monomers.

4.3 Synthesis
of Pd-Grafted Porous Organic Polymer
(Pd-PDVTTT-1)
In the typical synthesis of Pd-grafted porous
organic polymer Pd-PDVTTT-1, the as-synthesized polymer, 1.5 g of
PDVTTT-1 was taken into the 100 mL round bottom flask containing 25
mL of absolute ethanol. Then, 0.3 g of palladium acetate was added
to it, followed by slow adquadition of 0.3 g of sodium borohydride
as a reducing agent and then the reaction mixture was refluxed for
24 h under nitrogen atmosphere. Finally, the gray solid sample was
collected through filtration and washed using absolute ethanol. The
dried solid product was subjected to thorough characterizations. The
schematic representation for the formation of Pd-grafted porous organic
polymer Pd-PDVTTT-1 is shown in Scheme 1.

4.4 General Procedure for the
Catalytic Reactions
For the hydrodeoxygenation reaction,
100 mg of vanillin was taken
in 15 mL of water and the mixture was placed under H2 pressure
(1 MPa) in a Teflon-lined reactor along with 35 mg of the Pd-PDVTTT-1
catalyst. This catalytic hydrodeoxygenation reaction was carried out
at 150 °C for 16 h. The major product of the HDO of vanillin
was 2-methoxy-4-methylphenol (MMP) together with a minor amount of
byproduct 4-hydroxymethyl-2-methoxyphenol (HMP). The progress of the
completion of the reaction was monitored by collecting aliquots and
analyzing them by using capillary gas chromatography (Varian 6200
GC).

4.5 Instrumentation
Powder X-ray diffraction
patterns of the POP materials before and after Pd impregnations were
recorded by using a Bruker D8 Advance SWAX diffractometer operated
with 40 kV voltage and 40 mA current. The XRD instrument was calibrated
by using a standard Si sample, and Ni-filtered Cu Kα radiation
with wavelength λ of 0.154 06 nm used as the X-ray source.
BET surface area and porosity of these materials were estimated from
the respective N2 sorption isotherms at 77 K by using a
Quantachrome Instruments Autosorb-1C surface area analyzer. The samples
were activated at 403 K under high vacuum for 12 h before the N2 adsorption–desorption analysis. The pore size distributions
were estimated from these N2 sorption isotherms using the
nonlocal density functional theory (NLDFT) and carbon/slit pore model
as reference. For the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
analysis, a very small amount of the Pd-PDVTTT-1 sample was taken
in absolute ethanol and finely dispersed in the medium through sonication
for 5 min. Then, a small amount of the dispersed solution was dropped
over a carbon-coated copper grid and this was dried under high vacuum
before analysis. FTIR spectra of the samples were recorded on a PerkinElmer
Spectrum 100 spectrophotometer, whereas solid-state 13C
CP MAS NMR spectrum was recorded by using a Bruker Advance 500 MHz
NMR spectrometer. The thermogravimetric (TG) and differential thermal
analysis (DTA) of Pd-PDVTTT-1 were recorded on TA-SDT Q-600 of TG
instruments under air flow with a temperature ramp of 10 °C/min.
The TPD analyzer TP-5080 of Micrometrics, was employed to obtain the
temperature-programmed desorption of CO2 (CO2-TPD) on PDVTTT-1. After degassing the sample at 125 °C under
inert atmosphere for 3 h, the sample was subjected for cooling down
to room temperature, followed by 30 min purging with CO2 gas in the U-shaped sample tube. Then, He gas was passed through
the U-tube for 45 min to flush out any residual CO2 gas
present in the sample chamber. Then, the temperature of the system
was increased and the respective CO2-TPD profile was recorded.
Further, for the determination of the chemical composition of PDVTTT-1,
the carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen contents in the material were recorded
by using the Vario EL III CHNOS elemental analyzer (Tables 1–3).
