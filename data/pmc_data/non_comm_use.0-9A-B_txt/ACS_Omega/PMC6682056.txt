Wet-process
phosphoric acid is a fundamental process in the fertilizer
industry. The influence of impurities on crystallization kinetics
of CaSO4 was investigated in the Ca(H2PO4)2–H2SO4–H3PO4–H2O system using a mixed
suspension mixed product removal crystallizer. Effects of Si, Al,
Fe, Mg, K, and Na on crystal morphology and structure were examined
in the highly acidic system through scanning electron microscopy and
high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. Results show that
the increase of Mg, K, and Na content facilitates crystal growth.
Si, Al, and Fe are beneficial to CaSO4 crystal growth at
a certain concentration range. Impurities also affect the crystal
morphology, and the addition of Si, Fe, and Na promotes the formation
of needle-like crystals compared with other impurities. X-ray diffraction
results show that the preferred crystal growth direction is (020),
and the interplanar spacing of the crystals is affected by the element
radius of the impurities.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Phosphorus
chemicals, which are widely used to produce fertilizers
and composite functional materials containing phosphorous,1,2 are mainly produced from phosphate rock through wet-process phosphoric
acid. Wet-process phosphoric acid is produced via the acidic decomposition
of phosphate rock, and CaSO4 is also generated in this
process as a byproduct. This process can be expressed by the following
equation 1  

However, phosphate rock in China is almost medium-sized and
low
grade, with high impurity content. A part of the impurities dissolves
into the liquid phase and affects the H3PO4 quality.
By contrast, undissolved impurities stay in the solid phase and affect
CaSO4 crystallization, thereby increasing the acid content
in the solid phase. The acid in phosphogypsum may reduce the phosphorus
pentoxide yield and extensively affect CaSO4 utilization
in various industries.3−5 In several industrial processes, the crystallization
of gypsum also leads to the blockage of pipes or filters and reduces
production efficiency.6−10 Therefore, the influence of impurities on phosphogypsum crystallization
needs to be investigated.

To date, effects of impurities on
CaSO4 crystallization
have been widely investigated,11−16 and many researchers support that impurities can affect the nucleation,
crystallization, morphologies, and filterability of gypsum crystals.17−21 The CaSO4 sizes with different impurities were investigated.
Low K+ and Na+ concentrations increase the average
diameter of the crystal, while the presence of Mg2+ and
Cu2+ increases the crystal size.22 Trivalent ions, such as Al3+ and Fe3+, also
increase the average diameter of the crystal at low concentrations
because they have a high surface adsorption affinity. Anions, such
as F–, can affect the gypsum crystal morphology
and form sphere-shaped aggregates.23 CaSO4 crystallization kinetics was also studied. Wang24 measured the CaSO4·2H2O crystallization rate by the free Ca2+ and SO42– ion dissolution rate. Results showed that the
silica colloid promotes the gypsum crystallization rate but exhibited
an insignificant effect on the nucleation rate for all saturated conditions.
Rabizadeh25 showed that Mg2+, Li+, and K+ were only adsorbed on the newly
formed surfaces of the growing gypsum crystals, while Na+ was incorporated into the synthesized crystals. The nucleation and
growth kinetics of Mg2+ are 5- to 10-fold lower than those
of Li+, Na+, and K+ because Mg has
higher ionic strength and hydration enthalpy than monovalent ions,
thereby inhibiting the crystal growth. Meanwhile, additives have great
effects on CaSO4 crystallization kinetics.26−30 Citric acid and 2-phosphonobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylic acid have
a strong effect on the induction period of gypsum nucleation.23,27 Malic acids can change crystal morphology through the selective
complexation with Ca active sites on the crystal planes.28 Phosphonate additives are very effective retardants
for gypsum crystallization because the phosphonate group can be adsorbed
onto the crystal surface to inhibit the crystal growth.29 Although previous researchers have achieved
many accomplishments in terms of the effects of impurity ions on the
shapes and size of CaSO4 crystals, these studies are based
on a neutral CaCl2 aqueous solution, which is a two-phase
solid–liquid system. The actual wet-process phosphoric acid
is a strong acidic solid–liquid–solid three-phase reaction.
Previous studies lacked a reference for the actual acid hydrolysis
process. Hence, the particle size, morphology, and crystallization
kinetics of CaSO4 with different impurities in a strong
acid system must be investigated.

In this work, the Ca(H2PO4)2–H2SO4–H3PO4–H2O system
was established to simulate the acid hydrolysis process.
A mixed suspension mixed product removal (MSMPR) crystallizer, which
is widely used in crystallization research studies,31−33 was used to
investigate the CaSO4 crystallization rates. The effects
of impurities on CaSO4 particle size, morphology, and structure
were analyzed using a laser particle size analyzer, a scanning electron
microscope, and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope.
On the basis of the above studies, the influences of different impurities
on the crystallization process and crystal structures of CaSO4 were determined. The results of this study may provide a
reference for the control of CaSO4 crystallization in the
wet-process phosphoric acid process.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Residence Time Determination
During
the crystallization process, the crystal size, morphology, growth,
and nucleation rate were closely related to the residence time in
the crystallizer. Therefore, the effects of residence time on CaSO4 crystallization were first investigated. X-ray diffraction
(XRD) results showed that the raw materials immediately reacted to
form CaSO4 after pumping into the crystallizer (Figure S1). The crystallizer was operated to
reach the steady state after 2.5–7τ (Figure S2). With the increase of residence time, the particles
size first increased and then decreased, which is similar to d0.5 (Figure 1). The maximum median size of 59 μm was obtained
at the residence time of 3 h. Then, it further decreased to 11 μm
at the residence time of 5 h.

Figure 1 Effect of residence time on the CaSO4 (a) particle size
distribution (PSD) and (b) median size.

Gypsum morphology is one of the most important factors affecting
the filtration rate. The filtration characteristics are influenced
by the crystal size.34 Therefore, the CaSO4 morphologies at different residence times are shown in Figure 2. When the residence
time was 3 h, the crystal was rod-shaped, thick, and uniform compared
with that of 2 h. However, the cluster crystals were formed at the
residence time of 4 h. When the residence time further prolonged to
5 h, the crystal becomes mainly rod-shaped and irregular because of
the collision between different particles. It may be explained by
the reason that excessively long residence time causes secondary crystal
nucleation according to the crystal nucleation process. Therefore,
3 h was the optimal residence time for the crystallization process
and was selected as the residence time in the kinetic experiments.

Figure 2 Effect
of residence time on the CaSO4 morphology.

2.2 Crystallization Kinetic
Parameter Determination
2.2.1 Particle Size Distribution
The
PSD results, which are shown in Figure S3, were used to calculate the CaSO4 crystallization kinetics.
The impurities affect the crystal size and morphology in the crystallization
process, which depends on the growth rate of different crystal faces.21,25 The average particle size of CaSO4 crystals increased
with the increasing content of Si, Fe, Al, and K. For Al, Fe, and
Mg elements, the particle size curve deviated to two peaks at high
impurity content (Figure 3). The influence of Mg on the crystal size was minimal among
these elements, and the particle size fluctuated at approximately
50 μm, which is consistent with the results reported in the
literature.35 However, the increasing Na
content reduced the crystal size. The median size of CaSO4 crystals gradually decreased from 12 to 7 μm.

Figure 3 Effects of Al3+ on the CaSO4 crystal PSD.

2.2.2 Population Density Calculation
Population densities nL under different
conditions were calculated through eq 6. The typical relationship between ln (nL) and L is shown in Figure 4. The population density decreased
rapidly in the range of small particle sizes, thereby indicating that
the results in this range deviated from the MSMPR theory. The nonlinear
part indicates the nonconstant crystal growth rates which are caused
by the agglomeration of small CaSO4 particles.36 According to the relationship between ln (nL) and L, the growth rate,
nucleation rate, and agglomeration kernel factor can be further calculated.

Figure 4 Relationship
between the population density and particle size at
the Al/Ca ratio of 0.1.

2.2.3 Crystallization Kinetic Correlation
Nucleation rate, growth rate, and agglomeration kernel were obtained
using eqs 9–11, respectively. Impurities were divided into four
categories according to the main group element, and their effects
on the crystallization process were discussed.

2.2.3.1 Effect
of Si
The effect of SiO2 on crystallization kinetics
was studied by changing the molar
ratio of silicon to calcium. With the increase of molar ratio as shown
in Figure 5, the growth
rate increased at low ratio but decreased at high ratio. The effect
on nucleation rate was opposite to that on growth rate. Therefore,
the growth rate and nucleation rate have extreme values in the investigated
range of the Si/Ca ratio. When the Si/Ca ratio was 0.02, the maximum
SiO2 growth rate was 3.44 × 10–19, and the minimum nucleation rate was 9.35 × 1015. With the increase of SiO2, the agglomeration kernel
increased from 4.32 × 10–19 to 3.51 ×
10–18. Combined with PSD results for different Si/Ca
ratios, the increase of particle size at relatively low Si/Ca ratio
may be due to the growth of the crystals. Then the agglomeration kernel
increased rapidly with the Si/Ca ratio and played the dominant role
for the increase of crystal size and peak separation of PSD spectra.

(a) growth rate; (b) nucleation rate; and (c) agglomeration kernel.

2.2.3.2 Effect
of Al and Fe
Al and Fe
have considerable effects on CaSO4 crystallization. As
shown in Figure 6,
the CaSO4 growth rate first increased with the increasing
Al/Ca ratio or Fe/Ca ratio. The maximum growth rates of 5.53 ×
10–19 and 2.61 × 10–19 were
obtained at the Al/Ca ratio of 0.02 and the Fe/Ca ratio of 0.06, respectively.
The effects of Fe and Al on CaSO4 crystallization were
essentially the same. However, the growth rate with addition of Al
was approximately twice higher than that with Fe, and the nucleation
rate was 2 orders of magnitude larger than that with Fe. The growth
rate began to decrease with increasing Al or Fe content at high Al/Ca
ratio or Fe/Ca ratio. The reason may be due to the fact that the increase
of the concentration of Al and Fe causes the attraction between Al3+ and Fe3+ ions and the SO42– anion in solution. This attraction reduces the collision probability
of Ca2+ and SO42– ions and
thus affects the crystal growth rate.37 Meanwhile, the adsorption of ions is proved as another reason to
lead to the inhibition of crystal growth.38 With the increase of Al and Fe concentrations, the nucleation rate
and agglomeration kernel first increased and then decreased. The agglomeration
kernel decreased faster with the increase of Fe content than that
of the Al content. It leads to the larger particle size of the crystal
with the impurity of Al than that of Fe.

on CaSO4 crystallization; (a) growth
rate; (b) nucleation rate; and (c) agglomeration kernel.

2.2.3.3 Effect of Mg
The effect of Mg2+ on CaSO4 crystal growth
was investigated. As
shown in Figure 7,
the CaSO4 crystal growth rate gradually increased with
increasing Mg content and achieved the maximum value of approximately
7.90 × 10–19. Then, the growth rate decreased
slightly when the Mg/Ca ratio was larger than 0.1. The effect on the
nucleation rate was opposite to the growth rate. It is attributed
to the effects of impurities on ionic strength and supersaturation.39,40 Meanwhile, Mg is likely to be present as ions or charged complexes
and affects the activities of Ca2+ and SO42–.14,41,42 As a result, the nucleation rate decreased from 1.10 × 1017 to 4.40 × 1016 with increasing Mg content.
Guan43 also proposed that Mg2+ may adsorb on the active sites and delay nucleation at a relatively
low supersaturation rate. With the increasing Mg concentration, the
agglomeration kernel first decreased and then increased, but the fluctuation
was small.

Figure 7 Effects of Mg on CaSO4 crystallization; (a) growth rate;
(b) nucleation rate; and (c) agglomeration kernel.

2.2.3.4 Effects of K and Na
The effects
of alkali metals on CaSO4 crystallization rates are shown
in Figure 8. With the
increase in K/Ca ratio, the CaSO4 crystal growth rate increased
from 6.74 × 10–19 to 8.66 × 10–19 and then decreased slightly. The improved crystal growth rate has
been attributed to the reduction of interfacial energy.39 With the increase of K concentration, the nucleation
rate first increased and then decreased. The aggregation kernel increased
from 1.53 × 10–17 to 3.80 × 10–17 with the increase in K content. The CaSO4 crystal growth
rate increased with increasing Na/Ca ratio. In addition, Na is more
conducive in promoting the crystal growth than K. When the Na/Ca ratio
was 0.1, the growth rate increased to 1.79 × 10–18, which agrees with the results reported by Cui.44 The addition of appropriate amount of Na was also proposed
for the H2SO4 decomposition of phosphate rock
to form superior crystals and to improve the P yield. Oppositely,
the nucleation rate and the agglomeration kernel gradually decreased
with increasing Na/Ca ratio.

Figure 8 Effects of K and Na on the CaSO4 crystallization;
(a)
growth rate; (b) nucleation rate; and (c) agglomeration kernel.

According to the effects of different
impurities on crystallization
kinetics, the favorable impurity contents for CaSO4 crystal
growth can be concluded as follows: Si/Ca = 0.02, Al/Ca = 0.02, Fe/Ca
= 0.06, Mg/Ca = 0.1, K/Ca = 0.08, and Na/Ca = 0.1. Under those conditions,
the crystals prefer to form larger particles, which are beneficial
for the industrial operations.

2.3 Effect
of Impurities on the CaSO4 Crystal Morphology
Morphologies of CaSO4 crystals
obtained in all conditions are shown in Figure S4, and typical morphologies of CaSO4 are shown
in Figure 9. It is
found that the impurities played an important role in crystal growth.
Uneven and curved tips can be observed in the presence of different
impurities. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed that
Si and Na had a great influence on crystal morphology among the investigated
impurities. The presence of Si and Na resulted in the formation of
elongated needle-like crystals, which is similar to the morphology
of calcium sulfate hemihydrate.10 However,
XRD analysis showed that no phase transition occurred during the process.
Different with the addition of Si, the crystals presented as needle-like
clusters with the increase of Na content.

Figure 9 Effect of impurities
on the morphology of CaSO4 tips;
(a) Si/Ca ratio was 0.02; (b) Al/Ca ratio was 0.02; (c) Fe/Ca ratio
was 0.02; (d) Mg/Ca ratio was 0.02; (e) K/Ca ratio was 0.02; and (f)
Na/Ca ratio was 0.023.

It is clearly visible that as the Al content increased, the
shape
of crystals transformed from elongated to short rods. The particles
were small but with uniform size because of the gradual increase in
the nucleation rate. However, crystals with rough surface and needle-like
shape have been formed in the presence of Fe.

In addition, Mg
and K have weak effect on the crystal morphology.
As the Mg content increased, the surface of the crystal was transformed
from rough to smooth, which suggested that the addition of Mg may
lead to the formation of defective crystals.

2.4 Effect
of Impurities on the Crystal Structures
The effects of different
impurities on the CaSO4 crystal
structure have been investigated through high-resolution transmission
electron microscopy (HRTEM) and selected area electron diffraction
pattern analyses (Figure 10).45 The crystal plane directions
of the CaSO4 crystal are both (020) and (002) according
to the calculation of Crystal Maker software. According to the XRD
results shown in Figure 11, the growth orientation of the CaSO4 crystal was
(020) with the addition of different impurities. However, the main
growth direction of CaSO4 with the addition of Si was opposite
to those crystals with the addition of other impurities.

impurities: (a) SiO2, (b) AlPO4, (c) MgO, and
(d) NaOH.

Figure 11 (a) XRD pattern analysis of the products
prepared with different
impurities and (b) local magnification of peak position corresponding
to the crystal plane (020).

The interplanar spacing of the crystals was calculated by
Fourier
transformation, and the effects of different impurities on the interplanar
spacing of CaSO4 crystals were investigated. As shown in Figure 12, the interplanar
spacing values of the crystal plane (020) were 3.3956, 3.4014, 3.4320,
and 3.5651 Å, with the Si/Ca, Al/Ca, Mg/Ca, and Na/Ca ratio of
0.02, respectively. According to the XRD results shown in Figure 11, the distance
between crystal planes (020) was 3.4955 Å (reference code 01-072-0503).
The crystal plane spacing increased with the addition of Na and decreased
with the other impurities. It may be attributed to different atomic
radii of added impurities. Impurities with larger atomic radius had
a larger interplanar spacing of CaSO4, and the results
showed that impurities have been combined in CaSO4 (Figure S5). As shown in Figure 11b, the peak position of the curve deviated
the (020) crystal plane to the right with the addition of Mg. It is
suggested that Mg is easier to be adsorbed on the surface of the crystal
than Na and others.25 The change of interplanar
spacing of the (020) crystal plane indicates the substitution of Mg2+ for Ca2+ into the structure.40 However, the interplanar spacing with the adsorption of
Mg is still closest with that of the reference value as the similarity
properties between elements in the same main group.

on CaSO4 interplanar spacing.

3 Conclusions
The effects of impurities
on CaSO4 crystallization were
systematically investigated in a highly acidic system of Ca(H2PO4)2–H2SO4–H3PO4–H2O. The results
showed that the optimum residence time for CaSO4 crystallization
was 3 h. The CaSO4 crystal growth can be facilitated when
the impurity contents in phosphate rock are as follows: Si/Ca = 0.02,
Al/Ca = 0.02, Fe/Ca = 0.06, Mg/Ca = 0.1, K/Ca = 0.088, and Na/Ca =
0.1. The presence of impurities formed elongated crystals compared
with crystals without impurities through the changes of growth, nucleation
rates, and agglomeration kernels. In particular, Si, Fe, and Na exhibited
the most significant influences on crystal morphology among the impurities.
XRD results indicated that the preferred crystal growth orientation
was (020), and SiO2 may significantly affect the growth
rate of this crystal plane. The interplanar spacing of the (020) crystal
plane is also changed with the atomic radius of impurities. The results
can provide a reference for selective removal of different impurities
and CaSO4 crystallization control in the wet-process phosphoric
acid process.

4 Materials and Methods
4.1 Materials
All chemicals used in the
experiments were of analytical grade. In the actual production process,
returning acid predecomposed the phosphate rock, which further facilitated
the reaction with H2SO4 (Figure S6). The equations are as follows 2   3  

Therefore, the returning acid,
which
was prepared with H3PO4, H2SO4, and deionized H2O, was used for CaSO4 crystallization. The molar ratio of H2O, H3PO4, and H2SO4 is 1:0.1:0.01. Meanwhile,
analytical grade Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O (≥92%; Aladdin Bio-Chem Technology Co. Ltd.) was
directly used as the raw material and reacted with H2SO4 (95–98%; Beijing Chemical Works) and H3PO4 (≥85%; Xilong Scientific Co. Ltd.). To investigate
the effect of impurities on the crystallization process, Mg, Si, Fe,
Al, K, and Na were selected as impurities according to phosphate rock
formation. The impurities were added in the forms of phosphates, oxides,
or hydroxides. Using analytical grade AlPO4 [≥54%
(Al2O3); TianJin GuangFu Fine Chemical Research
Institute], SiO2 (≥99%; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent
Co., Ltd.), MgO (≥98%; XiLong Scientific Co., Ltd.), Fe2O3 (≥99%; Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co.,
Ltd.), KOH (≥85%; XiLong Scientific Co., Ltd.), and NaOH (≥96%;
Beijing Chemical Works). The effects of impurities in the reagents
on the crystallization of calcium sulfate can be neglected. Different
impurities were mixed with Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O, and the ratio of impurity elements to Ca is
shown in Table 1.

4.2 Experimental Procedure
Experiments
were carried out in a 2 L round-bottomed flask (Figure 13). The reaction temperature
was 80 °C, and the system was stirred with a flat-bladed stirrer
at a constant rate of 300 rpm. First, the returning acid and Ca(H2PO4)2·H2O were previously
mixed in container 1 according to the liquid–solid ratio of
2:1(mass ratio), and the impurities were also added. H2SO4 and H2O were mixed in container 2. The
solutions in containers 1 and 2 were pumped into the reactor at a
certain rate through two peristaltic pumps. When the residence time
(τ) was reached, the reaction solution was extracted by a peristaltic
pump to keep a constant volume in the crystallization reactor. Samples
were collected at the same time interval. The PSD of the sample was
analyzed immediately, and a certain volume of suspension sample was
filtered, washed, and dried. Suspension density (MT) was measured according to the quality of the dried
sample and the volume of filtrate (for details on calculations, see
the part of Section 4.3). The investigation was done in the context of a continuous steady-state
crystallization process, and each experiment with different conditions
should be kept for 8–10τ. PSD was analyzed using a laser
particle size analyzer (Mastersizer-2000). The morphologies of crystals
were analyzed using SEM (JSM-7610F). Analysis of crystal structures
was conducted on HRTEM (FEI talos-F200X), and the distribution of
elements was analyzed by Super-EDS. The crystal form and preferential
growth direction were also evaluated via XRD (Empyrean).

4.3 Kinetic Model Establishment
For an
MSMPR crystallizer, Randolph and Larson46,47 proposed the
following volume-based population balance equation 4  The moment
transformation approach is adopted
to solve eq 2. The growth
rate was assumed to be independent of the particle volume. In addition,
the rupture term (Bd – Dd) can be neglected. Thus, the equation can
be simplified as follows 5  where Gv is the
crystal volume growth rate and n indicates the population
density and is a function of particle volume as follows 6  According to the references, the agglomeration
term (Ba – Da) can be represented by the following equations 7   8  The crystal growth
rate Gv, nucleation rate B0, and
agglomeration kernel β were obtained by substituting eqs 5 and 6 into eq 3 and following
the treatment proposed by Hulburt and Katz48,49 as follows 9   10   11  where
μ0, μ1, and μ2 are
the sum of the multiplication between
the population density and particle volume of all particles at different
moments and can be obtained as follows with different moments (i = 0, 1, 2). 12  where v is the crystal volume
and n(v) is the crystal population
density. We used the change in impurities to evaluate the effects
they have on gypsum nucleation and growth.
