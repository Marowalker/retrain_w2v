The
NusB–NusE protein–protein interaction (PPI) is
critical to the formation of stable antitermination complexes required
for stable RNA transcription in all bacteria. This PPI is an emerging
antibacterial drug target. Pharmacophore-based screening of the mini-Maybridge
compound library (56 000 molecules) identified N,N′-[1,4-butanediylbis(oxy-4,1-phenylene)]bis(N-ethyl)urea 1 as a lead of interest. Competitive
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay screening validated 1 as a 20 μM potent inhibitor of NusB–NusE. Four focused
compound libraries based on 1, comprising 34 compounds
in total were designed, synthesized, and evaluated as NusB–NusE
PPI inhibitors. Ten analogues displayed NusB–NusE PPI inhibition
≥50% at 25 μM concentration in vitro. In contrast to
representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Bacillus subtilis species, these analogues showed up to 100% growth inhibition at
200 μM. 2-((Z)-4-(((Z)-4-(4-((E)-(Carbamimidoylimino)methyl)phenoxy)but-2-en-1-yl)oxy)benzylidene)hydrazine-1-carboximidamide 22 showed excellent activity against important pathogens.
With minimum inhibitory concentration values of ≤3 μg/mL
for Gram-positive Streptococcus pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ≤51 μg/mL for Gram-negative Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, 22 is a potent lead for a novel antibacterial target.
Epifluorescence studies in live bacteria were consistent with 22, inhibiting the NusB–NusE PPI as proposed.

Introduction
Antibiotics are pivotal
to modern medicine. They enable clinicians
to conduct invasive surgery, treat immune-compromised patients, and
carry out blood transfusions on trauma victims with a minimal risk
of death due to secondary bacterial infections.1,2 However,
the prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria threatens our ability
to survive clinically and community-acquired infections. This increasing
prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria has the very real potential
to undermine all of these significant medical advances.3,4

Antibiotic-resistant bacteria are estimated to result in 48 000
deaths annually in the United States and Europe.3,5 Of
equal concern is that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
only one new antibiotic in 2015, Avycaz (avibactam/ceftazidime), for
the treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections.6 This lack of innovation and investment has meant
that a number of multidrug-resistant bacterial strains, particularly
the “ESKAPE” pathogens: Enterococcus
faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, are extremely
challenging to treat and, in some cases, require complex antibiotic
cocktails.7 Potentially of greater concern
is that the current antibiotic development places considerable emphasis
on new iterations of existing drugs, and hence these agents are vulnerable
to the rapid acquisition of resistance from the dissemination/modification
of the preexisting mechanisms.8 Clearly,
there is a pressing need to develop new antibiotic classes, especially
those with a lower inherent resistance susceptibility.4,8−12 As a result, global
strategies, such as “The 10 × 20 Initiative”, seek
to combat this crisis, and this initiative has the ambitious target
of 10 new antibacterial drugs by 2020.13

Key to the development of next-generation antibacterial agents
is the identification of new drug targets, and, to this end, there
is a growing focus on interrogating the bacterial interactome to identify
essential protein–protein interactions (PPIs). These PPI networks
can, in principle, be targeted by small-molecule inhibitors.14−16 To date, the inhibition of PPIs has proved fruitful, with multiple
PPI-targeted drugs receiving FDA approval, including Lifitegrast,
Venetoclax, and Birinapant.17,18 These accomplishments
have validated PPIs as drug targets, thus opening up opportunities
to develop new classes of antibacterial agents.18,19

A typical PPI is predominantly hydrophobic in nature, with
a handful
of polar residues located centrally across a protein surface of area
1000–2000 Å2. The polar, and nearby hydrophobic,
residues give rise to critical small “hot spots” and
impart a significant proportion of the binding energy responsible
for the observed PPI.18,20,21 These hot spots and the presence of a degree of conformational flexibility
make targeting PPI an attractive potential therapeutic intervention.
One such PPI in the bacterial interactome is the interface between
the transcription factors, NusB and NusE.

The NusB–NusE
PPI is a critical nucleation point for the
formation of the antitermination complex enabling the regulation of
bacterial stable (t- and r-) RNA transcription.22 In the Gram-negative model, Escherichia
coli, point mutations, for example, nusE100 (R72G)23 and nusB5 (Y18D),24 result in a reduced protein–protein
binding affinity, affecting the formation of the antitermination complex.24,25 Strains nusE100 and nusB5 are
unable to efficiently transcribe the 16S and 23S ribosomal transcripts,
which impedes the formation of new ribosomes and leads to reduced
growth,26,27 demonstrating the importance of the NusB–NusE
binding interface.

The examination of the Aquifex
aeolicus (PDB: 3R2C) and E. coli (3D3B) NusB–NusE
heterodimer crystal structures reveals a PPI surface area of ∼1600
Å2 (Figure 1A).25,28 The PPI interface comprises a
mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions resulting from
helix α1 and strand β2 of NusE bridging the two helical
bundles of NusB (Figure 1A–C). Because of the complexity of biomacromolecules under
physiological conditions, significant differences typically exist
between the NMR and X-ray crystallographic structures of the same
protein and so we chose to use both the NMR and crystal structures
of A. aeolicus and E.
coli proteins to reveal the major hydrogen-bonding
contributions.25,28,29 As seen in Figure 1B,C, these occur between NusB E81 (E. coli E81)–NusE H15 (E. coli H15),
NusB Y16 (E. coli Y18)–NusE
D19 (E. coli D19), and NusB R76 (E. coli E75)–NusE R16 (E. coli R16) interactions (Figure 1B). The NusB E81 (E. coli E81)–NusE
H15 (E. coli H15) interaction is absent
in the E. coli crystal structure,25 which is consistent with the high relative B
factors observed, indicative of the conformational flexibility in
those regions in both the A. aeolicus and E. coli protein crystal structures
(PDB IDs: 3R2C and 3D3B,
respectively). A close examination of the modeled interface highlights
a potentially key interaction between the E. coli E81 and H15 residues and reflects the structural information in
solution.29 Subsequently, we developed
a hybrid NusB–NusE interface using the information from the A. aeolicus NMR study and the crystal structure,
as well as the E. coli crystal structure
(Figure 1),25,28,29 which united the structural information
from both techniques and two species.

model based on the NusE amino acids responsible for binding with NusB,

Previously, we reported
the development of a pharmacophore model,
on the basis of the published NMR and X-ray crystallography structures
of the NusB–NusE PPI of A. aeolicus and E. coli.30 This model merged key structural information from three different
studies and two bacterial species.25,28,29 Critical to this model was the α1-helix sequence
of NusE, which interacts with the binding groove of NusB. Three critical
hydrogen bond interactions between the α1-helix of NusE (D19,
R16, and H15) and the binding groove of NusB (Y16 (E. coli Y18), R76 (E.coli E75), and E81), as shown in Figure 1B,C, were manually plotted to generate a pharmacophore
(Figure 1D). Screening
of this pharmacophore against the mini-Maybridge compound library
(56 000 molecules) identified 25 hits. A pharmacophore validation
was then conducted using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA)-based screen and a subset of hits, which were synthesized
in-house. From the screen 1,1′-((butane-1,4-diylbis(oxy))bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(3-ethylurea), 1 was identified as a 19.8 ± 1.7 μM inhibitor of
the NusB–NusE PPI (Figure 2).30

Figure 2 Chemical structure of
1,1′-((butane-1,4-diylbis(oxy))bis(4,1-phenylene))bis(3-ethylurea) 1 identified through in silico screening of the mini-Maybridge
library and ELISA screening of the NusB–NusE interaction as
a 20 μM potent inhibitor of the NusB–NusE PPI. Also depicted
are the four regions identified for modification and SAR generation.

Herein, we report the computational
and biological screening-guided
design, synthesis, and characterization of four structural activity
relationship libraries, which focus on modifications to four key regions
of lead 1, the bis-ether linker region (A), head-group
orientation (B), role of asymmetry (C), and head-group functionality
(D), to develop inhibitors of the bacterial PPI between NusB–NusE
as potential antibacterial agents (Figure 2).

Results and Discussion
In this work,
our previously developed pharmacophore was ported
to the molecular operating environment (MOE) software and used to
perform the docking analysis of 1 with the NusB A. aeolicus (PDB: 3R2C) interface.31,32 After initial docking of 1 at the NusB interface, the
docked system was subjected to a short molecular dynamics cascade
(production step of 2 ns at 300 K), which revealed the predicted pose
for 1 as “horseshoe-like” that enabled
key hydrogen bond interactions with Y16, R76, and E81 consistent with
the initial pharmacophore in silico screening of the mini-Maybridge
compound library (Figure 3).

Figure 3 Docking study of lead 1 at the proposed A. aeolicus (PDB: 3R2C) NusB–NusE interface (stick representation,
carbon atoms are shown in yellow). The pharmacophore features are
shown as spheres, namely, hydrogen bond donor (pink) and hydrogen
bond acceptor (green). Predicted hydrogen bond interactions with key
residues (green) are shown as dashed lines. Compound 1 shows a horseshoe orientation with one ether oxygen hydrogen bonding
with the side chain of Y18 and the adjacent urea moiety hydrogen bonding
with E81 (side chain) and R76 (backbone).

On the basis of the above docking study, analogues 10a–c were designed to probe the optimal
linker
length, whereas 10d would examine the impact of heteroatom
incorporation. The remaining analogues in this library, 10e–i, were proposed to explore the optimum turn
radius of the “horseshoe” binding conformation (Scheme 1). The synthesis
of the focused library commenced with the coupling of 4-nitrophenol 2 under modified Finkelstein conditions with α,ω-dichloro
linkers 5a–c to give the corresponding
bis-ethers 6a–c. Flow hydrogenation
(ThalesNano H-cube) over Raney Ni facilitated a quantitative conversion
to the corresponding amines 8a–c.
The treatment of these amines with ethyl isocyanate afforded the desired
urea analogues 10a–c. In an effort
to generate hydrogenation-susceptible linkers (e.g., alkenes 8e and 8f, Scheme 1), the synthesis commenced with the corresponding N-Boc-4-aminophenol 3, followed by coupling
with the appropriate α,ω-dichloro linker 5e and 5f to afford 7e and 7f. Boc removal (HCl/dioxane) and coupling with ethyl isocyanate gave
the desired urea analogues 10e and 10f.
Bis-ureas 10g–i were accessed by
an alternative pathway, where 4-aminophenol 4 was treated
with ethyl isocyanate, yielding urea 9, followed by coupling
with an α,ω-dichloro linker to give the desired compounds.
This urea-based library, 10a–f, was
evaluated for their ability to inhibit the NusB–NusE PPI using
a Bacillus subtilis NusB and a glutathione-S-transferase
(GST)-tagged NusE competitive ELISA. These data are presented in Table 1.30

Table 1 Inhibition of the
NusB–NusE
Binding by 1 and 10a–i at 25 μM Compound Concentration Using an ELISA
The examination of the data presented in Table 1 indicated that minor
adjustments to the
linker length were tolerated with 1, 10a and 10b displaying 52–59% inhibition of the
NusB–NusE PPI at 25 μM. However, elongation to heptyl 10c removed the activity, as did the incorporation of an ether
linker 10d (Table 1). In keeping with the docking study prediction, the introduction
of turn-inducing linkers 10e and 10g afforded
an increase of activity to 72 and 65% respectively. Hence, the turn
radius appears crucial as the 1,3-disubstituted phenyl derivative 10h and the furan derivative 10i displayed a
marked reduction in activity. With analogue 10h, the
data suggest that the turn radius was too high for efficient positioning
of the urea head groups essential for hydrogen bonding with D75, R76,
and E81. Furan 10i also showed a loss in activity, which
was most likely a consequence of the introduction of a heteroatom
to the linker (cf. 10d). The diminished activity of 10i and 10d, in addition to the visual inspection
of the docked compounds, suggested that the hydrophobic cleft shaped
by L20, Y79, and V80 of the NusB-binding groove does not tolerate
electronegative atoms (Figure 4). This hypothesis was further supported by the improved binding
affinity of hydrophobic linkers 10e and 10g.

Figure 4 Docking studies of 10e at the proposed A. aeolicus NusB–NusE interface, with the
stick representation of atoms colored by type. Key amino acids L20,
Y79, and V80 that form the hydrophobic cleft, which interacts with
the hydrophobic linker region of 10e, are depicted. In
addition, the close proximity of R76 (side chain) to the ethylurea
head group of 10e is shown.

The initial docking study of 1 indicated that
one
of the urea moieties adopted an orientation in close proximity to
R76 (Figures 3 and 4). This suggested that a modification of the urea
moiety may affect the binding affinity of subsequent analogues. As
a result, we explored the development of a second library based on 10e. The initial focus turned to the positioning of the pendent
urea moieties through the synthesis of the remaining 1,2- and 1,3-substituted
ureas. These analogues were synthesized according to Scheme 1, commencing from the corresponding N-Boc-2-phenol and N-Boc-3-phenol to give 10j and 10k, respectively (Table 2). We also examined the effect of installation
of a single urea isostere with a retention of one urea moiety, giving
asymmetric analogues 13a–i. The synthesis
of these asymmetric analogues commenced from mono-urea 9, which was coupled with (Z)-1,4-dichloro-2-butene 5c, giving 11, which, in turn, was treated with
a range of substituted phenols to give rise to 13a–i (Scheme 2). The asymmetric 13a–i were screened
for their ability to inhibit the NusB–NusE PPI using an ELISA,
and the data are presented in Table 2.

Scheme 2 Reagents and Conditions
(a)
Cs2CO3, 12a–i, anhydrous dimethylformamide
(DMF) 75 °C, 2 h; (b) 4 M HCl in dioxane, room temperature, 2
h.

Table 2 Inhibition of NusB–NusE
Binding
Interaction by 10e, 10j, 10k, and 13g–i at 25 μM Compound
Concentration Using an ELISA
As demonstrated by the data presented in Table 2, 10j and 10k were
significantly less active than 10e, supporting a 1,4-substitution
pattern as a requirement for inhibitory activity. Additionally, 13a–i were less active at 25 μM
than 10e, indicating that a urea moiety is a curial component
of the binding affinity. Within the asymmetrically substituted library, 13i was the most potent compound, inhibiting 50% of binding
at 25 μM.

Having identified the crucial role of a urea
moiety, the subsequent
library investigated a series of urea bioisosteres. As outlined in Scheme 3, compounds 15a–f were synthesized under standard
second-order nucleophilic substitution conditions to afford the desired
bis-ether derivatives. N-Methylacetamide 16 was accessed by the treatment of 8e with acetyl chloride.
Thiourea 17 was synthesized by the reaction of 8e with ethyl isothiocyanate in the presence of triethylamine.
Saponification of 15e yielded carboxylic acid 18, which underwent amide coupling with methylamine to give 19. Nitrile 15d provided oxadiazole 20 in
two steps, and on treatment with trimethylaluminum and ammonium chloride
afforded the imidamide 21. Finally, compound 22 was accessed via a microwave-facilitated imine formation using aldehyde 13f and a catalytic amount of HCl and aminoguanidine. These
analogues were screened for their ability to inhibit the NusB–NusE
PPI, and the data are presented in Table 3.

Table 3 Evaluation of NusB–NusE Binding Inhibition at 25
μM Using an ELISA 6e, 7e, and 13–21
a ‘-’
no activity at
25 μM compound concentration.

The moderate activity of 18 aligned with
the initial
docked conformation (Figure 4), which suggested one of the urea moieties resided within
close proximity to R76; however, this result also indicated that for
this interaction to occur the ionic moiety must be relatively small
(e.g., 18 vs 13b and 13c) (Table 2). Nonetheless, with
the exception of 18 and 8e, a biological
evaluation of this fourth series of compounds indicated that an amide
moiety was required with compounds 15a–f exhibiting ≤43% inhibition. Additionally, the dual nitrogen
atoms of the urea moiety appear to be essential for activity with
the removal of either the nitrogen α-16 or γ-19 to the aromatic ring (relative to 10a), resulting
in a 27 or 15% reduction of NusB–NusE PPI inhibition, respectively.
This inference was supported by the acetimidamide 21 being
devoid of activity and the reduced activity of 7e. A
further bioisosteric replacement of the oxygen 10e with
sulfur, 17, abolished activity. However, installation
of mono-aminoguanidine 22 or carboxylic acid 18 afforded a similar binding inhibition to lead compound 1.

Having established SAR data based on the four focused libraries
developed herein, we evaluated analogues with >50% inhibition in
the
NusB–NusE binding ELISA as potential inhibitors of bacterial
growth. As outlined in Table 4, B. subtilis and E. coli were used as representative Gram-positive
and Gram-negative species, respectively.

Pleasingly, all compounds in this analysis exhibited
some level
of bacterial growth inhibition ranging from mild to excellent at 200
μM across both E. coli and B. subtilis or against a single species. Analogues 1 and 10g exhibited selective inhibition of E. coli at 17 and 19%, respectively. Compound 10a selectively inhibited the growth of B.
subtilis at 31%. Notably, the incorporation of a cis-butene
linker with 8e, 10e, 13i, 16, 18, and 22 resulted in an antibacterial
activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. Of
the analogues evaluated herein, 22 showed the greatest
activity with 100% inhibition against both B. subtilis and E. coli. Although our ELISA evaluation
of these analogues showed promising levels of inhibition of the NusB–NusE
PPI, the use of these compounds in bacteria screen reveals a poor
correlation between ELISA and phenotypic outcomes, which is most probably
a consequence of either a poor uptake or a rapid efflux of these compounds.

As our initial lead 1 has been predicted (but not
demonstrated) to be hepatotoxic,33 we examined
a number of analogues in a panel of 11 cancer and 1 normal cell lines.
However, we detected no cytotoxicity for our lead 1 or
for the related analogues 8e, 10a, 10b, 10e, and 18. Toxicity, at a
level comparable to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values,
was noted with analogues 13i and 22 (Table 5), but after a 4-fold
increase in exposure times (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide (MTT) assay conducted over 72 h; MIC evaluation over 18 h).34 It is important to recognize the difference
between chronic and acute use and that this in vitro toxicity determined
using human cancer cell lines is not a demonstration of in vivo toxicity.
Ultimately, only in vivo evaluation will be the determinant of safety
and tolerability.35

With 22 displaying a promising antibacterial
activity,
it was further examined against four clinically relevant Gram-positive
and Gram-negative human isolates (Table 6). The MIC for 22 was determined
against community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus USA300 (CA-MRSA), Streptococcus
pneumoniae D39, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14, and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC19606.

compound	Staphylococcus aureus USA300	Streptococcus
pneumonia D39	Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14	Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC19606	
22	≤3	≤3	≤51	≤51	
An examination of the data presented in Table 5 shows 22 as highly potent,
with an MIC of ≤3 μg/mL (7 μM), against both S. aureus USA300 and S. pneumoniae D39. This result is comparable to that of clinically relevant tetracycline,
which has an MIC of 12–96 μg/mL against isolates of S. aureus USA300.36 In
addition, 22 showed a promising activity against both P. aeruginosa PA14 and A. baumannii ATCC19606 with an MIC of ≤51 μg/mL (125 μM) against
both isolates. Again, this promising result is comparable to the data
obtained previously with penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems,
which have MICs of 4–16 μg/mL against P. aeruginosa.37

To confirm that compound 22 had a mechanism of action
consistent with the inhibition of rRNA transcription through targeting
the NusB–NusE interaction, epifluorescence microscopy was performed
on B. subtilis strains BS23 and BS61.38,39 Strain BS23 contains a GFP fusion to the α subunit of the
membrane-localized ATP synthase, whereas BS61 contains a GFP fusion
to NusB that has a signal restricted to the subnucleoid foci that
represent the sites of rRNA synthesis (Figure 5A,D, respectively).38,39 The treatment of BS23 with 22 (Figure 5C) at 3 μM (1.2 μg/mL) had no
effect on ATP synthase localization compared with colistin (Figure 5B), which caused
the delocalization of the ATP synthase indicative of a membrane damage.
This result confirms that 22 does not target the cell
membranes. Furthermore, the lack of a morphological change of the
cell outline or filamentation, which is indicative of the cell wall
synthesis, cell division, or chromosome segregation defects, suggests
that 22 does not affect the cytoplasmic membrane, cell
wall integrity, or DNA synthesis. The treatment of BS61 (NusB-GFP)
with 22 (Figure 5F) caused a significant delocalization of the NusB-GFP signal,
similar to that seen with rifampicin, a known inhibitor of transcription
(Figure 5E). The delocalization
of the NusB-GFP signal is consistent with the loss of rRNA transcriptional
activity similar to that seen on the induction of the stringent response,
a bacterial starvation response that results in a massive downshift
of the rRNA synthesis,39 supporting the
result of our modeling and ELSIA study that 22 is able
to target the NusB–NusE interaction in live cells.

(rif); (F) BS61 treated with 22.

The epifluorescence microscopy data are consistent with the
ability
of 22 to target NusB and inhibit rRNA synthesis in live
cells and support our proposed mechanism of action with 22. However, the cytotoxicity of 22, although not inherent
within this compound class (cf. 1, 8e, 10a, 10b, and 10e, all of which
inhibit the NusB–NusE PPI >50% at 25 μM and show no
cytotoxicity; Table 5), suggests that that
there is an additional unidentified off-target effect of this analogue.

Conclusions
A screening of our NusB–NusE pharmacophore against the mini-Maybridge
compound library (56 000 molecules) and a subsequent ELISA
screening identified 1 as an inhibitor of the NusB–NusE
PPI. Guided by the molecular modeling approaches, the subsequent development
of four focused compound libraries led to the identification of 22 as a potent antibacterial agent active against clinically
relevant Gram-positive isolates S. aureus USA300 (methicillin resistant) and S. pneumoniae, with an MIC of ≤3 μg/mL against both strains. In addition, 22 showed a promising activity against problematic Gram-negative
isolates P. aeruginosa PA14 and A. baumannii ATCC19606, which have proven to be difficult
to treat, with an MIC of ≤51 μg/mL against both isolates.
Furthermore, using epifluorescence microscopy, we demonstrated that
the mode of action of 22 is consistent with the inhibition
of the interaction of NusB with NusE, which would lead to a significant
reduction in rRNA synthesis. We believe that 22 is a
promising lead compound for the development of next-generation broad-spectrum
antibiotic agents, further validating the NusB–NusB protein–protein
binding interaction as a potential antibacterial target. However,
given the observed cytotoxicity of this analogue, a careful cytotoxicity
screening for the retention of this activity should be employed in
the further development of this analogue. Notwithstanding this, the
lack of cytotoxicity for other analogues within this family that also
displayed good levels of NusB–NusE PPI interaction, but only
low levels of antibiotic activity, supports the further development
of this compound class. Hence, our current focus is aimed at improving
the MIC value of 22 and examining the antibacterial effects
of subsequent analogues in other clinically problematic bacteria.
This represents a new class of antitranscription antibiotic leads
with activity against clinically relevant Gram-positive and Gram-negative
bacteria strains. As we have demonstrated an antibiotic effect that
supports the inhibition of the NusB–NusE PPI, future analogues
targeting this interaction should design away from any cytotoxicity
liability. Notwithstanding this, an in vivo evaluation of later generations
will be the ultimate determination of toxicity.

Experimental Section
Biology
Plasmid
Construction
All of the cloning steps were
carried out in E. coli DH5α ( Table S1). The plasmids and bacterial strains
used and constructed in this work were confirmed by DNA sequencing
and are listed in Table S1. B. subtilisnusB was amplified using
primers 5′-AAAGGAGATCTAGACATGAAAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-TTTTCTGGTACCCTATGATTCCC-3′
from purified B. subtilis chromosomal
DNA. The nusB mutants were made by PCR splicing using
mutant primers (altered bases in lower case) 5′-CTTTGCAGGCACTAgcTCAAATTGATGTC-3′
and 5′-GACATCAATTTGAgcTAGTGCCTGCAAAG-3′ (F15A); 5′-GAATTGGAAGCTCGATgcGATTGCCAATG-3′
and 5′-CATTGGCAATCgcATCGAGCTTCCAATTC-3′ (R70A); and
5′-GATTGCCAATGTTGcCCGTGCGATTTTGC-3′ and 5′-GCAAAATCGCACGGgCAACATTGGCAATC-3′
(D75A).40 The amplicons were cut with XbaI and Acc65I and inserted into similarly
cut pETMCSIII (Table S1) to produce pNG130,
pNG1178, pNG1179, and pNG1180, respectively (Table S1). B. subtilisnusE was amplified using primers 5′-AGGAGGGTCTAGAATGGCAAAAC-3′
and 5′-CTATATTTTAGGTACCAAGTTTAATTT-3′ from B. subtilis chromosomal DNA and ligated into the NdeI and Acc65I sites of pNG651 to give
pNG896.

Protein Overproduction and Purification
B. subtilis NusB (wild type and mutant) and NusE-GST
were overproduced and purified using a similar approach to that described
previously.15,41 Briefly, E. coli BL21 (DE3) was transformed with one of the protein overproduction
plasmids (Table S1) and cultures were grown
in an autoinduction medium for 48 h at 25 °C. Following lysis
and clarification, the NusB proteins were purified using a 1 mL HisTrap
HP column (GE Healthcare) and the GST-tagged NusE was purified using
a 1 mL GSTrap column (GE Healthcare). The purified proteins were dialyzed
into 20 mM KH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, 30% glycerol,
pH 7.8, and stored at −80 °C.

ELISA
Purified
full-length B. subtilis NusB was diluted
to 250 nM in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and
100 μL of the solution was added into NUNC Maxisorp microtitre
plate wells. Following overnight incubation with the NusB solution
at 4 °C, the wells were washed three times with 300 μL
of PBS buffer and blocked with 300 μL of 1% (w/v) bovine serum
albumin dissolved in PBS buffer at room temperature. After 2 h blocking,
the plates were washed three times with a wash buffer (PBS, 0.05%
(v/v) Tween-20). The appropriate inhibitor (Tables 1–4) and 100
μL of affinity-purified GST-tagged NusE at 200 nM were incubated
at 37 °C for 15 min, then added to each well, and incubated for
1 h at room temperature. Unbound NusE was removed by washing each
well three times in 300 μL of the wash buffer. Rabbit anti-GST
primary antibody (100 μL, 1:2000 in PBS) was added to each well
and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, goat-anti-rabbit
HRP secondary antibody (1:2000 in PBS) was added to each well, incubated
for 1 h at room temperature, and then washed three times in 300 μL
of the wash buffer. Visualization of PPI was achieved by adding 100
μL of 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (liquid substrate
system for ELISA, Sigma-Aldrich) to each well. The plate was incubated
in a plate reader (FLUOstar Optima) at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking
for 6 min. The optical density of each well was recorded at 600 nm.

Growth Inhibition Assay
The compounds were dissolved
to 50 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and serially diluted in 100
μL of Luria broth (LB) to concentrations of 2.0, 1.0, 0.5, 0.25,
0.125, 0.0625, 0.032, 0.016, 0.008, 0.004, 0.002, and 0.001 mM in
a 96-well NUNC MicroWell plate. Strains except S. pneumoniae were grown at 37 °C in 5 mL of LB with shaking until the A600 reached 0.6–0.7 AU, and 5 μL of the culture
was added to each well. The plate was incubated in the plate reader
(FLUOstar Optima) at 37 °C with 200 rpm shaking. S. pneumoniae was grown in brain heart infusion (BHI)
broth at 37 °C in the presence of 5% CO2. A 5 μL
of the culture at 0.6–0.7 AU A600 was added to each
well, and the plate was incubated in the plate reader at 37 °C
with shaking only for 10 s preceding an optical density reading. The
optical density of the culture was taken every 10 min using LB or
BHI as the blank for 16 h at 600 nm. The samples were tested in triplicate,
and the growth pattern of each sample was compared to that of the
cells exposed to equal amounts of DMSO.

Cytotoxicity Growth Inhibition
All test agents were
prepared as stock solutions (20 mM) in DMSO and stored at −20
°C. Cell lines used in the study included MCF-7 (breast carcinoma);
HT29 (colorectal carcinoma); U87, SJ-G2 (glioblastoma); SMA (murine
glioblastoma); A2780 (ovarian carcinoma); H460 (lung carcinoma); A431
(skin carcinoma); Du145 (prostate carcinoma); BE2-C (neuroblastoma);
and MiaPaCa-2 (pancreatic carcinoma) and the non-cancer derived MCF10A
breast cell line. All cancer cell lines were incubated in a humidified
atmosphere (5% CO2 at 37 °C) and maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM; Sigma, Australia) supplemented
with fetal bovine serum (10%), sodium pyruvate (10 mM), penicillin
(100 IU/mL), streptomycin (100 μg/mL), and l-glutamine
(4 mM). The non-cancer MCF10A cell line was cultured in DMEM:F12 (1:1)
cell culture media, 5% heat inactivated horse serum, supplemented
with penicillin (50 IU/mL), streptomycin (50 μg/mL), 20 mM Hepes, l-glutamine (2 mM) epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), hydrocortisone
(500 ng/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and insulin (10 μg/mL).
Growth inhibition was determined by plating cells in duplicate in
medium (100 μL) at a density of 2500–4000 cells per well
in 96-well plates. On day 0 (24 h after plating), when the cells are
in logarithmic growth, medium (100 μL) with or without the test
agent was added to each well. After a 72 h drug exposure, growth inhibitory
effects were evaluated using the MTT assay and the absorbance was
read at 540 nm. An eight-point dose–response curve was produced,
from which the GI50 value was calculated, representing
the drug concentration at which the cell growth was inhibited by 50%
on the basis of the difference between the optical density values
on day 0 and those at the end of drug exposure.34

Microscopy
B. subtilis strains BS23 (atpA-gfp)38 and BS61 (nusB-gfp)39 were grown in LB medium at 37 °C with shaking until OD600 becomes ∼0.5. At this point, 2 mL of aliquots were
transferred to 15 mL tubes, antibiotics/compounds were added (5 μg/mL
rifampicin, 10 μg/mL colistin, or 1.2 μg/mL 22), and the cultures were incubated with shaking for a further 30
min. The cells were then imaged by epifluorescence microscopy as detailed.15

Molecular Modeling
Molecular docking
was performed
using the docking engine of MOE software (MOE, Montreal, QC, Canada)
“MOE-Dock” with “Triangle Matcher” as
the ligand placement method. The docked poses were refined using our
reported pharmacophore and re-ranked. The highest ranked pose was
exported to Accelrys Discovery Studio software. Water and axillary
molecules were omitted, and the structure was typed with CHARMM force
field and subjected to the implemented standard molecular dynamics
cascade (two steps of energy minimization using steepest decent and
conjugate gradient methods, heating to 300 K and equilibration for
100 ps). An in vacuo energy minimization procedure was performed.
The production phase for the equilibrated system was run for 2 ns
at 300 K. The obtained model was analyzed for potential interaction
using MOE-LigX module.

Chemistry
General Methods
All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
AK Scientific, Matrix Scientific, or Lancaster Synthesis and used
without purification. All solvents were redistilled from glass before
use.

1H and 13C NMR spectra were recorded
on a Bruker Avance AMX 400 spectrometer at 400.13 and 100.62 MHz,
respectively, and an Advance AMX 600 spectrometer at 600.21 and 150.92
MHz, respectively. Chemical shifts (δ) are reported in parts
per million (ppm) measured relative to the internal standards. Coupling
constants (J) are expressed in hertz (Hz). Mass spectra
were recorded on a Shimadzu LCMS 2010 EV spectrometer and an Agilent
6100 series single quadrupole LCMS system using a mobile phase of
1:1 acetonitrile/H2O with 0.1% formic acid. Samples analyzed
by Mass Spectrometry User Resource & Research Facility (MSURRF),
University of Wollongong, Australia, for high-resolution mass spectrometry
(HRMS) analytical HPLC traces were obtained using a Shimadzu system
possessing an SIL-20A autosampler, dual LC-20AP pumps, CBM-20A bus
module, CTO-20A column heater, and a SPD-20A UV/vis detector. This
system was fitted with an Alltima C18 5 μm 150 mm
× 4.6 mm column with solvent A (0.06% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)
in water) and solvent B (0.06% TFA in CH3CN–H2O) (90:10). In each case, HPLC traces were acquired at a flow
rate of 2.0 mL min–1 and gradient 10–100
(%B), over 15.0 min, with detections at 220 and 254 nm. All samples
returned satisfactory analyses. The compound purity was confirmed
by a combination of LC–MS (HPLC), micro-, and/or high-resolution
mass spectrometry and NMR analysis. All analogues are ≥95%
pure.

Melting points were recorded on a Büchi Melting
Point M-565
instrument. IR spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Spectrum Two
FTIR Spectrometer with the UATR accessories. Thin-layer chromatography
(TLC) was performed on Merck 60 F254 precoated aluminum plates with
a thickness of 0.2 mm. Column chromatography was performed under “flash”
conditions on Merck silica gel 60 (230–400 mesh).
