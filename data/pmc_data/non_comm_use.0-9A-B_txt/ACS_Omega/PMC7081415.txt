This work unveils the roles played
by potato starch (ST) in the
immobilization, photochemical reduction, and gas sensitivity of graphene
oxide (GO) films. The ST/GO films are assembled layer by layer (LbL)
onto quartz substrates by establishing mutual hydrogen bonds that
drive a stepwise film growth, with equal amounts of materials being
adsorbed in each deposition cycle. Afterward, the films are photochemically
reduced with UV irradiation (254 nm), following a first-order kinetics
that proceeds much faster when GO is assembled along with ST instead
of a nonoxygenated polyelectrolyte, namely, poly(diallyl dimethylammonium)
hydrochloride (PDAC). Finally, the gas-sensing performance of ST/reduced
graphene oxide (RGO) and PDAC/RGO sensors fabricated via LbL atop
of gold interdigitated microelectrodes is evaluated at different relative
humidity levels and in different concentrations of ammonia, ethanol,
and acetone. In comparison to the PDAC/RGO sensor, the ones containing
ST are much more sensitive, especially when operating in a high-relative-humidity
environment. An array comprising these chemical sensors provides unique
electrical fingerprints for each of the investigated analytes and
is capable of discriminating and quantifying them in a wide range
of concentrations, from 10 to 1000 ppm.

Introduction
Graphene oxide (GO)
and starch (ST) have been combined in (bio)nanocomposite
structures, aiming at a great number of advanced technological applications.1 Apart from the parent graphene, the research
on GO has reached so many advancements that it has established itself
as an independent scientific subject.2−4 This status is mainly
credited to its lower cost and unique molecular structure, the latter
being rich in oxygenated groups (hydroxyl, ether, epoxide, carbonyl,
carboxyl, etc.) that ensure water dispersibility, possibility of postfunctionalization,
and compatibility with several (nano)materials.2−4 On the other
hand, ST is a polysaccharide available from different natural sources,
such as vegetables and cereals, and presents excellent film-forming
ability.5 Moreover, the components of ST,
namely, amylose and amylopectin, are endowed with three hydroxyl groups
per each monomeric unit capable of establishing strong inter- and
intramolecular hydrogen bonds responsible for its stiffness and swelling
behavior.6 Consequently, GO and ST mix
together very easily because of mutual hydrogen bonding and compatibility
in common solvents, including water.7,8 In contrast
to more conventional metal and metal oxide fillers, GO can improve
at a much lower cost and in a more benign way the mechanical, thermal,
and electrical properties of ST.8−11

Whereas the use of GO–ST nanocomposites
with improved mechanical
and barrier properties for reinforced materials, adsorbents, and drug
delivery is obvious, their application in electronics looks very unusual,
since ST is an electrical insulator. Nonetheless, more recent literature
has changed this paradigm and many electronic applications involving
GO–ST nanocomposites have emerged, especially in the field
of chemical sensors. The constituents of ST can tailor the chemoresistive
response of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) sensors by adopting different
chain conformations at the sensoactive layer.12 In addition, ST can be employed as a stable matrix to immobilize
a myriad of electroactive species, including TiO2 nanoparticles,
reduced graphene oxide (RGO), gold nanoparticles, tyrosinase with
nanodiamond, and amorphous carbon nanoparticles, to be further employed
in the electrochemical detection of estradiol,13 estriol,14 epinephrine,15 tetracycline,16 phenolic
compounds,17,18 and iodide.19 In all of these examples, the electrical insulating behavior
of ST is counterbalanced by its film-forming ability, innocuous nature,
low cost, and ready availability.

Herein, a more ambitious use
of ST is proposed, in which it is
employed to, simultaneously, immobilize, mediate the photochemical
reduction, and modulate the gas sensitivity of layer-by-layer (LbL)
films of GO. The LbL technique is chosen because it is recognized
as a powerful method to direct the construction of functional materials
in the framework of layered structures.20,21 First, the
LbL technique is performed by successive and alternated immersions
of a quartz substrate into potato ST and GO aqueous suspensions, which
leads to a stepwise film growth with equal amounts of ST and GO being
transferred to the solid substrate, owing to the establishment of
mutual hydrogen bonds. Second, the LbL-assembled ST/GO film is subjected
to UV (254 nm, 16 W) irradiation to drive the environmentally friendly
photochemical reduction of GO to RGO at much higher rates (four times)
than that achieved with a conventional polyelectrolyte, namely, poly(diallyl
dimethylammonium) hydrochloride (PDAC). Finally, the gas-sensing performance
of ST/RGO sensors fabricated via LbL atop of gold interdigitated microelectrodes
is evaluated in different relative humidity (RH) environments and
in different concentrations of ammonia, ethanol, and acetone. In comparison
to the PDAC/RGO sensor, the ones containing ST are much more sensitive,
especially in high RH. An array comprising these chemical sensors
provides unique electrical fingerprints for each of the investigated
analytes and is capable of discriminating them in a wide range of
concentrations, from 10 to 1000 ppm. The roles played by ST in the
ST/GO/RGO films and sensors are fully unveiled and supported by UV–vis,
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR), Raman, and electrical impedance
spectroscopies.

Results and Discussion
Layer-by-Layer Deposition
of the ST/GO Film
Figure 1 provides the UV–vis
and FTIR spectra of plain ST and GO suspensions and the respective
ST/GO LbL film deposited onto quartz and silicon slides. As seen in Figure 1a, ST does not absorb
in the UV–vis, while GO absorbs at 230 nm (π →
π*) and 300 nm (n → π*). Comparatively, the UV–vis
spectra of the ST/GO film resemble very much that of plain GO (Figure 1b). Moreover, film
absorbances at 230 and 300 nm increase linearly with the number of
ST/GO bilayers (inset), with the following linear regression equations:
Abs (230 nm) = 0.120 + 0.062×, R2 = 0.99; Abs (300 nm) = 0.095 + 0.428×, R2 = 0.98. This stepwise growth is a consequence of the same
amount of materials being adsorbed in each deposition cycle. This
behavior is typical of electrostatic-driven LbL assembly but in the
present case is attributed to the hydrogen bonding between −OH
groups in ST and −OH, −C–O–C–,
and =C = O from GO, as proposed in Scheme 1c. It is worth mentioning that
the LbL assembly of PDAC and GO conducted in the same conditions (Figure S1) is not so efficient and the amount
of materials adsorbed per bilayer is smaller in that case. This is
because charged polyelectrolytes are subjected to stronger electrostatic
repulsion, which prevents the adsorption of alike species and, consequently,
reduces the amount of the adsorbed material.22

Figure 1 UV–vis

LbL film deposited onto quartz with an increasing number of ST/GO
bilayers. The inset in (b) shows the dependence of film absorbance
at 230 and 300 nm on the number of ST/GO bilayers. FTIR spectra of
plain GO, plain ST, and the (ST/GO)-10 film deposited onto silicon
and recorded in different ranges: (c) 4000–2500 cm–1 and (d) 2000–1000 cm–1.

Scheme 1 (a) Illustration of the LbL Deposition, (b) Photochemical Reduction,
and (c) Model of Interaction between ST and GO within the Films
The hypothesis of hydrogen bonding is supported
by the FTIR spectra
provided in Figure 1c,d. The spectra were divided into two to make the visualization
easier. The range between 2000 and 2600 cm–1 does
not exhibit any peak, except for the presence of environmental CO2 at 2350 cm–1. As shown in Figure 1c, the −OH stretching
(νOH) in plain GO is broad, with a strong peak at 3232 cm–1 and a weaker one at 3572 cm–1,
which are assigned to intermolecular hydrogen bonding and free −OH
stretching, respectively. Meanwhile, the spectrum of plain ST shows
a single peak for the −OH stretching at 3317 cm–1, accompanied by the asymmetric and symmetric −CH2 stretching peaks (moieties in the glucose ring) at 2932 and 2888
cm–1, respectively. In the (ST/GO)-10 film, the
−OH stretching is blue-shifted to 3360 cm–1. In regard to plain GO, the shift is as high as +128 cm–1, while to ST is +43 cm–1. On the other hand, the
asymmetric and symmetric −CH2 stretching peaks are
red-shifted in the film (−33 and −4 cm–1, respectively). In addition, in Figure 1d, a systematic blue shift of the carboxylic
and carboxylate stretching can be seen when going from plain GO to
the (ST/GO)-10 film. The shifts are +13 cm–1 for
the carboxyl group and +12 cm–1 for the carboxylate.
Generally, hydrogen bonding in infrared spectra is easily detected
by a red shift of the peak positions because the force constant of
bonds in the groups involved in hydrogen bonds are lowered.23 Nonetheless, Hobza and Havlas have pointed out
that strong inter/intramolecular hydrogen bonding should rather strengthen
them, which causes the blue shift.24 Indeed,
other authors have reported such a blue shift in the FTIR spectra
of GO–ST nanocomposites and its positive effect on the tensile
strength of their films.8 Therefore, it
is proposed here that the (ST/GO) films are assembled by means of
hydrogen bonds established between oxygenated functional groups from
ST and GO, as detected by the blue shift in the FTIR peak positions
and illustrated in Scheme 1c.

Photochemical Reduction of the ST/GO Film
Figure 2 displays
UV–vis
data used to access the photochemical reduction kinetics of the (ST/GO)-10
film. To ascertain the role played by starch, the photochemical reduction
of the (PDAC/GO)-10 film was also investigated under identical conditions.
As shown by the UV–vis spectra, the π → π*
absorption becomes stronger as the photoreduction time elapses. Nonetheless,
this effect is seen more clearly for the (ST/GO)-10 film (Figure 2a) than for the control,
(PDAC/GO)-10 (Figure 2b). It is important to observe that the (PDAC/GO)-10 absorbance is
smaller because the amount of adsorbed GO is smaller in that film,
as discussed in the previous section and Figure S1. The photoreduction isotherms, constructed with the maximum
absorbance and maximum wavelength reached by the π →
π* transition as a function of the photoreduction time, are
shown in Figure 2c,d,
respectively. They show that the π → π* transition
has a greater absorbance and appears at longer wavelengths in the
(ST/GO)-10 than in the (PDAC/GO)-10, even though they were subjected
to the same UV treatment. The isotherms were fitted with eq 1 1  in which A is the absorbance
(or wavelength) at any photoreduction time, A1 and A2 are absorbance (or wavelength)
constants, k is the observed rate constant (expressed
in s–1), and t is the photoreduction
time (expressed in s). The equation is analogous to a first-order
kinetics equation, provided that A1 – A2 equals A0, which
is the absorbance (or wavelength) at t = 0 s. Table 1 collects all fitting
parameters obtained after this procedure. They do not only confirm
that the photoreduction is more effective but also show that it is
faster in the (ST/GO)-10 film (refer to the observed rate constants
in Table 1).

It is clear that the presence of ST somehow enhances
the photoreduction
of GO. In the absence of ST, the photoreduction of GO occurs by means
of the photodissociation of OH groups, followed by subsequent elimination
of CO and CO2.25 Consequently,
the amount of sp2 carbons increases and GO becomes RGO.
Nonetheless, this process is relatively slower in the absence of external
electron-donating species. On the other hand, ST, which does not absorb
in the UV range (see Figure 1a), could be oxidized by the photoexcited GO, which becomes
a stronger oxidizing agent, and provide electrons to it, something
that PDAC is unable to do. This hypothesis would explain why the GO
photoreduction is more effective in the (ST/GO) film. To confirm that,
FTIR spectra of the (ST/GO)-10 film, before and after being subjected
to the photochemical treatment (ST/RGO-UV)-10, are compared to that
of plain ST, as shown in Figure S2a. As
expected, part of the oxygen functionalities is not detected in the
spectrum of the photoreduced film, (ST/RGO-UV)-10. Nonetheless, the
νCOOH peak becomes much stronger in the photoreduced film, confirming
the hypothesis of ST oxidation concomitantly with the GO photoreduction.
The relevance of ST as an external source of electrons has also been
observed during the photoreduction of silver ions.26 These findings explain why the photochemical reduction
proposed herein is more effective for the (ST/GO)-10 than for (PDAC/GO)-10. Figure S2b shows the Raman spectra of the ST/GO
film before and after photochemical reduction. The efficacy of the
photochemical method is demonstrated by the increase of the relative
ratio between the intensities of the D and G bands (ID/IG), from 0.8 in the (ST/GO)-10
to 0.94 in the (ST/RGO-UV)-10.

The photochemical reduction was
also monitored by measuring the
electrical resistance (direct current, DC resistance) of the film
as a function of the photoreduction time. Films were deposited onto
interdigitated microelectrodes (IMEs), as described in Experimental Section. As shown in Figure 3, for both (ST/GO)-10 and (PDAC/GO)-10, the
electrical resistance starts at a very high value (actually, open-circuit
condition) and drops steeply until reaching a constant, low value.
Nonetheless, striking differences between films can be viewed. First,
the photoreduction kinetics is much faster in the (ST/GO)-10 film
(Figure 3a); second,
its electrical resistance, achieved after the UV treatment is ended
(400 min), is significantly lower (3 orders of magnitude) than that
of the (PDAC/GO)-10 film (Figure 3b); and third, the (ST/GO)-10 film becomes much darker
(insets). This behavior corroborates the structural features presented
in the previous discussion and, therefore, confirms further the importance
of ST for the GO photoreduction. Additionally, Figure 3c provides the scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) micrograph of the (ST/RGO-UV)-10 film. The surface of the film
appears quite smooth. No difference between the sample before and
after UV photoreduction could be detected by SEM.

Dynamic and Static Gas-Sensing Performances of ST/RGO Films
The gas-sensing performance of ST/RGO sensors was investigated
by AC measurements conducted at different RH levels and in different
concentrations of ammonia, ethanol, and acetone. Figure 4 shows dynamic responses of
(ST/RGO-UV)-5, (ST/RGO-UV)-10, and (ST/RGO-HZ)-10 sensors to RH. For
comparison, the response of the (PDAC/RGO-UV)-10 sensor is made available
in the Supporting Information (Figure S3). To make a more straightforward comparison between sensors made
by photochemical reduction, their responses are depicted on the same
full scale. It is observed that (ST/RGO-UV)-5 and (ST/RGO-UV)-10, Figure 4a,b, respond to RH
in a repetitive and reproducible manner, with the electrical resistance
increasing with the increment of RH. This behavior is expected for
a p-type semiconductor in the presence of electron-donating species
like water molecules. The same behavior can be observed for the (ST/RGO-HZ)-10
sensor but only until RH = 50% (Figure 4c). Above that point, the signal is not reproducible
anymore. This problem was systematically observed in the subsequent
measurements. Figure 4d shows the calibration curve for each sensor, which was built with
the response (ΔR/R0) as a function of the RH percentage. Although (ST/RGO-UV)-5 shows
the largest absolute response (R), its signal (ΔR/R0) is comparable to that
of (ST/RGO-UV)-10. Moreover, they show similar sensitivity, [ΔR/R0]/RH, although (ST/RGO-UV)-5
becomes saturated above RH = 80%.

Figure 4 Dynamic responses at 1 kHz for ST-based
sensors exposed to different
levels of RH as indicated: (a) (ST/RGO-UV)-5, (b) (ST/RGO-UV)-10,
and (c) (ST/RGO-HZ)-10. (d) Sensor signals (ΔR/R0) as a function of the RH level.

To understand the mechanism underlying the sensor
response to RH,
impedance spectroscopy was conducted under different RH levels at
static conditions. As shown in Figure 5, the Nyquist plots reveal that (ST/RGO-UV)-5 and (ST/RGO-UV)-10
sensors behave as a typical series RC circuit, whereas (ST/RGO-HZ)-10
behaves like a parallel RC circuit. Their impedances Z are given by eqs 2 and 3, respectively, in which R is the
resistance, C is the capacitance, j is the imaginary number √−1, and ω is the angular
frequency (or else 2πf) 2   3  The observed behaviors are related
to the
way the sensors are built. The photoreduced sensors are assembled
with GO, which can establish a more intimate contact with ST through
hydrogen bonds. The reduction to RGO is performed only after that
contact is established. On the other hand, the (ST/RGO-HZ) sensor
is already assembled with RGO. In contrast to GO, RGO is highly hydrophobic,
making the interaction with ST more difficult, and, consequently,
the film assembly is less effective. In fact, the amount of adsorbed
RGO in this sensor was much smaller than in any other sensor, even
for the same number of deposited bilayers. Despite this meaningful
difference, both groups of sensors are basically composed of a considerable
capacitive component from the remaining GO phase, which could not
be completely reduced to RGO (in the case of photoreduced sensors),
and the dielectric contribution from ST, which is an insulating material
common to all of them. Therefore, their microstructure can be viewed
as composed of highly conducting islands (RGO phase) surrounded by
an electrical insulating matrix (GO and ST or PDAC phases). When they
are exposed to increasing levels of RH, water molecules diminish the
charge transport across the film by either standing between the islands
or transferring electronic density to them. This hypothesis can also
account for the higher sensitivity of ST-based sensors to RH in comparison
to the PDAC-based sensor because ST has a greater affinity for water
molecules. This behavior is in accordance with that observed for RGO
sensors described elsewhere.27−29 However, it is in striking contrast
to the behavior observed in unreduced GO films.30−32 In general,
the past literature has hypothesized that protons are generated via
the reaction of water with the GO surface groups, leading to a decrease
of the GO electrical impedance. As pointed out by Bi et al.,30 the recorded impedance spectrum varied between
a large and incomplete semicircle, for low RH, to the combination
of a tiny and complete semicircle accompanied by a ∼45°
straight line (diffusion element), for high RH. The proposed equivalent
circuit considers a parallel RC or a parallel RCZ circuit, respectively,
in which the GO film/electrode interface is assigned to Z. In physical terms, the observed impedance decrease with the increase
of RH was ascribed to the electrical-field-triggered dissociation
of adsorbed water molecules into hydronium as charge carriers. The
model also claims that some of the GO oxygenated groups underwent
hydrolysis, contributing to the production of additional hydronium
ions. However, it is important to point out that, herein, GO establishes
hydrogen bonds with ST, thereby inhibiting hydrolysis of its functional
groups. Moreover, our sensors have been interrogated with a much lower
voltage amplitude (250 mV) and much higher frequency (1 kHz), which
are sufficient to avoid the permanent film polarization and subsequent
production of hydronium.

and (c)
(ST/RGO-HZ)-10 sensors recorded under different RH levels at static
conditions. Frequency range: 1 Hz to 100 kHz; excitation signal: 0.25
V.

The fabrication process proposed
herein is indeed very reproducible.
As shown in Figure 6, (ST/RGO-UV) sensors fabricated in different batches, with either
5 or 10 bilayers, present very similar performances (Figure 6a), which are reproducible
in different days of operation (Figure 6b).

sensors to
different levels of RH at 1 kHz, fabricated in two different batches
(A and B), as indicated, measured on (a) same day and (b) different
days.

The gas-sensing performance was
then tested with ammonia. Even
though ammonia is usually detected with polymer sensors at levels
close to a few ppm, high levels of ammonia can lead to nonresettable
gas sensor responses and some permanent chemical degradation of the
material, both in the bulk and at the interfaces. The sensitivity
of the P3HT-based sensor to ammonia is, for instance, limited to tens
of ppm.33Figure 7 shows the dynamic response of ST-based sensors
measured at 1 kHz to different concentrations of ammonia under RH
50%. The signal drift is ascribed to the incomplete recovery of ST
chain conformations in the time interval the cycling experiments were
performed. The sensor signal decreases upon exposure to ammonia, which
is in contrast to different studies reported elsewhere.34,35 The decrease is clearer seen in the calibration curve provided in Figure 7d. As mentioned before,
RGO behaves as a p-type semiconductor and ammonia molecules, which
can share their lone pair of electrons, should cause an increase of
the electrical resistivity of RGO. The presence of hydrophilic ST
in the sensors, however, retains much more water molecules, which
are capable of reacting with incoming ammonia molecules, producing
ammonium ions (as ammonium hydroxide) before they reach the RGO conducting
structure. Consequently, water molecules are no longer available for
blocking the electronic communication between the RGO sheets and the
electrical resistivity of the sensor decreases accordingly. It is
worth mentioning that (ST/RGO-HZ)-10 is the most sensitive to ammonia.
As discussed before, in the (ST/RGO-HZ)-10 sensor, the RGO-HZ phase
is very hydrophobic so that most of the water molecules are located
in the ST phase. Thus, incoming ammonia molecules preferably dissolve
in ST and do not reach the RGO phase. Additionally, the (PDAC/RGO-UV)-10
sensor (Figure 7d,
green dots) appears insensitive to ammonia. This behavior is explained
by the absence of ST because the amount of adsorbed GO in this sensor
is lower and the amount of GO that is converted into RGO by photochemical
reduction is limited.

Figure 7 Dynamic responses of ST-based sensors measured at 1 kHz
to different
concentrations of ammonia under RH 50%: (a) (ST-RGO-UV)-5, (b) (ST-RGO-UV)-10,
and (c) (ST-RGO-HZ)-10. (d) Sensor response (ΔR/R0, %) versus ammonia concentration
(ppm).

Despite the greater solubility
of ethanol and acetone in water
when compared to that of ammonia, they are not expected to react with
water as ammonia does. They simply associate with water by hydrogen
bonding. Therefore, they should increase the electrical resistivity
of RGO by placing in between RGO sheets. Nonetheless, such an effect
is not expected to be so efficient to cause sizable changes in the
GO/RGO electrical resistivity. In fact, the electrical resistance
of ST-based sensors increases in the presence of ethanol and acetone,
as shown in Figures S4 and S5. The sensitivity
to these analytes is, however, very small, probably because the RH
plays the major role and the presence of either ethanol or acetone
does not cause any additional change in the sensor responses. Different
contributions have shown that the detection of these analytes is quite
difficult unless they undergo chemical reactions with the sensing
layer. The atmospheric oxygen should play a pivotal role in this mechanism;
oxygen molecules adsorbed at the sensing layer are dissociated into
oxygen ions, which are then reduced by ethanol (or acetone). These
redox reactions involve electron transfer from/to the valence/conduction
band of the semiconducting sensing layer, then causing changes in
its electrical resistivity that are thus detected as the sensor signal.36,37 However, this dynamic process demands a p–n junction, which
is generally attained by combining GO/RGO with n-type inorganic semiconductors,
including, for example, SnO2 and CeO2.36−38 Since this is not the type of architecture that is employed herein,
the sensitivity to ethanol and acetone is almost negligible.

Performance
of the ST/RGO Sensor Array
Although the
ST/RGO sensors are more sensitive than the (PDAC/RGO-UV)-10 sensor,
individually, they do not achieve the performance of other plain RGO-based
sensors as reported elsewhere.27−38 Nonetheless, it is worth mentioning that the employment of ST and
the photochemical reduction makes the present fabrication process
much more affordable and environmentally friendly. Moreover, in practical
applications, the utilization of sensor arrays is preferred instead
of a single gas sensor, since the arrays can circumvent the cross-sensitivity
inherently associated with a single sensor and improve further the
discrimination of specific chemicals contained in complex samples.
In this regard, we assembled an array composed of (ST/RGO-UV)-5 and
-10, (PDAC/RGO-UV)-10, and (ST/RGO-HZ)-10 sensors and evaluated its
performance on the discrimination between different concentrations
of ammonia, ethanol, and acetone and different levels of RH. The electrical
data (resistance measured at 1 kHz) were processed by principal component
analysis (PCA). The PCA process comprises the decomposition of an
original data matrix into smaller matrixes, the score, the loading,
and the residue matrixes.39 Whereas the
score matrix is regarded as the position of samples in the data space,
where scores located at close positions refer to samples of similar
features (or compositions), the loading matrix describes the weights
for each original variable when calculating the principal component.
In practical terms, the loadings here refer to our sensors and the
weight they impart to the scores. The PCA plots presented in Figure 8 show that the proposed
sensor array successfully discriminates the analytes by chemical structure
and concentration. In terms of the chemical structure, the score PCA
plot depicted in Figure 8a shows analytes in defined and well-separated clusters. Moreover,
the role played by RH is even more evident there; scores for dry analytes
(open symbols) are completely distinguished from those for humid ones
(closed symbols). In addition, the arrows show the trend of the score
position in regard to the analyte concentration. This correlation
is explored for the quantification of each analyte, as will be seen
later. In Figure 8b,
the loading plot confirms the relevance of ST for the sensor response;
loadings of those made of ST are very close and isolated from that
of the PDAC-based sensor. This behavior was in fact expected, since
they have similar chemical compositions. The loading plot could also
help one to choose sensors; those that appear close together share
similar properties and, therefore, redundant responses. Thus, redundant
sensors could be removed from the sensor array and replaced by other
sensors.

Figure 8 PCA plots of the sensor array in response to different concentrations
of ammonia, ethanol, and acetone and different RH levels, as indicated:
(a) scores and (b) loadings. Electrical measurements performed at
1 kHz.

The array is also capable of quantifying
the analytes in a better
way than the sensors do individually. Since most of the data variance
is contained in the first PC (PC1), we built a calibration curve of
ΔPC1 versus the concentration of the analyte. ΔPC1 stands
for the difference between the score position at PC1 for each measured
concentration and the score position at PC1 for the blank (0% RH or
no analyte). As shown in Figure 9, a linear correlation between these two variables
is observed, with the following linear regression equations: ΔPC1
= −1.46 + 6.73 (% RH), R2 = 0.994;
ΔPC1 = 2.91 + 0.06 (ppm ammonia), R2 = 0.983; ΔPC1 = −0.067 + 0.005 (ppm ethanol), R2 = 0.986; ΔPC1 = 0.268 + 0.005 (ppm acetone), R2 = 0.946. A comparison made between the sensitivities
of the present sensor array and some other sensor systems reported
in the literature is provided in Table 2. Although the sensitivities accounted herein are made
in terms of data variance per concentration unit, they can be roughly
correlated to the percentage change of resistance per unit of concentration.
Therefore, it is seen that the ST/RGO-based sensor array shows sensitivity
to RH in the same range as reference sensors. For ammonia, it is below
the references, whereas for ethanol and acetone, it is far below the
references. Despite the lower performance, which could be improved
by diminishing the amount of ST in the sensing layer, the ST/RGO sensors
still show some advantages, such as the lower cost (some of the reference
sensors also employ inorganic nanomaterials) and more environmentally
friendly processing by means of UV photoreduction.

Conclusions
The results presented
herein show that the performance of starch/graphene
oxide sensors is superior to that of the PDAC-based sensor, especially
for RH and ammonia. This feature is ascribed to the multiple roles
played by starch in the construction and operation of this type of
device. First, starch is capable of establishing hydrogen bonds with
graphene oxide, which improves the film assembly further in contrast
to the ion pairing done with PDAC. This is an important feature since
starch is much cheaper than commercially available polyelectrolytes
routinely employed in the LbL deposition. Second, starch supplies
additional electron density during the photoreduction of graphene
oxide to reduced graphene oxide, making it faster and more effective.
In fact, the photochemical treatment is by far the most environmentally
friendly method for reduction, since it is performed in the solid
state and does not produce any waste. Third, starch enhances the sensitivity
to humidity because it is a hydrophilic/hygroscopic material. On the
other hand, PDAC being more hydrophobic decreases the sensor affinity
to water and makes it less sensitive to humidity. Although individual
sensitivities of the present sensors are not so high, when they are
operated together as an array, they show improved capabilities, making
possible the discrimination and quantification of RH, ammonia, ethanol,
and acetone. It is therefore concluded that starch can be intentionally
used to mediate the immobilization, photoreduction, and gas sensitivity
of graphene oxide/reduced graphene oxide films, performing all of
these tasks in a more benign and environmentally friendly way.

Experimental
Section
Materials
Graphite flakes (>100 mesh), PDAC 20%
aqueous
solution (MW 450 000 g mol–1), sodium 3-mercapto
propane sulfonate (3-MPS), and potato ST were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich,
Brazil, and used as received. Analytical-grade ethyl alcohol, acetone,
potassium permanganate, sodium nitrate, sulfuric acid 98%, hydrochloric
acid 36%, nitric acid 65%, hydrazine hydrate 25%, hydrogen peroxide
30%, and ammonium hydroxide 30% were all purchased from Vetec-Sigma,
Brazil, and used without additional purification. Quartz and Si (100)
slides (1 × 10 × 25 mm) were used as solid substrates for
the film depositions. Gold interdigitated microelectrodes (IMEs, 50
pairs of digits; digit spacing and width: 10 μm; digit height:
200 nm) stamped on borosilicate glass slides (1 × 10 × 25
mm) were used to evaluate the electrical properties of films and sensor
fabrication. The water used in all experimental procedures was of
ultrapure type (18 Mohm·cm), provided by a Milli-Q Millipore
purification system.

Preparation of GO, RGO, ST, and PDAC Suspensions
Graphite
oxide was prepared by oxidation of graphite flakes with potassium
permanganate, which was previously dissolved in a mixture of sulfuric
acid with sodium nitrate in accordance with the procedure described
by Hummers and Offeman.40 After proper
isolation and purification, 1 g of graphite oxide was suspended in
100 mL of ultrapure water, pH = 5.5, under ultrasonic stirring (Branson,
Sonifier 450) for 90 min (315 W; pulsed mode, 5/5 s on/off cycles).
During the entire treatment, the suspension was kept in an ice bath.
The obtained suspension composed of exfoliated GO sheets was centrifuged
at 10 000 rpm for 30 min to remove eventual aggregates. The
supernatant GO suspension was stored in the fridge until film depositions.
Its final concentration (in g L–1) was estimated
by gravimetric analysis.

The RGO suspension was prepared by
chemical reduction of GO with hydrazine, as described elsewhere.41 Henceforth, it will be named RGO-HZ. An aliquot
of the previously prepared GO suspension (50 mL, 0.2 g L–1, pH = 10) was transferred to a round-bottom borosilicate glass flask
(125 mL) and mixed with 50 μL of 25% hydrazine solution and
350 μL of 30% ammonium hydroxide solution. The mixture was heated
to 90 °C for 1 h under magnetic stirring. After this period,
the suspension became black, which indicated the reduction to RGO.
The RGO-HZ suspension was left to cool down at room temperature and
centrifuged (10 000 rpm, 10 min).

The ST suspension (10
g L–1) was produced in
two steps. In the first step, 2.0 g of ST was suspended in 200 mL
of ultrapure water and heated to 80 °C during 1 h under magnetic
stirring. This procedure leads to ST gelatinization, in which the
amylose–amylopectin granules are broken, favoring their dispersion.42 The suspension was left to cool down at room
temperature and, in a second step, was subjected to ultrasonic stirring
for 10 min (150 W; pulsed mode, 5/10 s on/off cycles). The second
step was performed to ensure complete disruption of amylose–amylopectin
granules.

The PDAC solution (1 g L–1) was
prepared by simple
dilution of the concentrated polymer in ultrapure water assisted by
magnetic stirring (30 min) at room temperature.

Substrate Cleaning
and LbL Film Depositions
The quartz
and Si substrates were sequentially cleaned in piranha solution (H2SO4/H2O2, 3:1, v/v) followed
by RCA solution (H2O/NH4OH/H2O2, 5:1:1, v/v) prior to the film assembly. This procedure rendered
the substrate surfaces negatively charged by dissociation of silanol
groups. On the other hand, the IMEs were soaked overnight in aqueous
3-MPS solution (1 mmol L–1) and rinsed with ultrapure
water afterward. This procedure leads to the functionalization of
the gold digits with negatively charged −SO3– moieties, which improve the adhesion of the subsequent
films.

The LbL deposition procedure was performed manually and
at room temperature, following the schematic illustration provided
in Scheme 1. The deposition
setup comprised two borosilicate beakers (25 mL) containing the deposition
suspensions (GO and RGO-HZ, 1.0 g L–1; ST, 10.0
g L–1; PDAC, 1.0 g L–1), a third
beaker (500 mL) containing ultrapure water (pH = 5.5) under magnetic
stirring, and an air compressor. The chosen substrate was immersed
alternately into the ST (or PDAC) and the GO (or RGO-HZ) suspensions
for 5 min each, followed by rinsing in ultrapure water during 20 s
and drying with compressed air. These sequential steps comprise one
deposition cycle or “bilayer” and were repeated to produce
multilayered films. Before the deposition, both quartz and IMEs were
primed with a PDAC layer to improve the adhesion of the subsequent
layers. Six different film architectures were produced: (ST/GO)-n, (ST/RGO-HZ)-n, (ST/RGO-UV)-n, (PDAC/GO)-n, (PDAC/RGO-HZ)-n,
and (PDAC/RGO-UV)-n, in which n stands
for the number of deposition cycles or bilayers and RGO-UV is the
sample obtained by photochemical reduction as described below.

Photochemical
Reduction
The photochemical reduction
of films was accomplished with a lab-made UV chamber containing two
UV lamps (254 nm, 8 W, Osram) and a computer fan, as pictured in Figure S6 (Supporting Information). In a typical
run, the film samples (ST/GO) or (PDAC/GO) were located approximately
10 cm below the UV lamps and irradiated during different periods of
time, as described in Scheme 1b. To ascertain the time needed to reach the maximum GO reduction,
UV–vis spectra (for films deposited onto quartz slides) and
DC electrical resistance (for films deposited onto IMEs) were registered
at different periods of UV irradiation. The longest UV treatment time
was 240 min. During the photoreduction, the chamber temperature was
held constant at 30 °C with the aid of the computer fan.

Structural
and Morphological Characterizations
UV–vis
absorption spectroscopy (Varian Cary 5000; range: 200–800 nm
with 10 nm s–1 scan rate and 0.05 nm resolution)
was employed to characterize GO, RGO-HZ, PDAC, and ST suspensions
(with quartz cuvettes of 10 mm optical path and two polished windows)
and to monitor the film deposition, with spectra being registered
after every two deposition cycles. The structure of films was also
assessed by micro-Raman (Horiba micro-Raman spectrometer model T64000,
excitation at 514.5 nm, 1 cm–1 resolution achieved
with 200 μm aperture slit and 2 mW of power at the output of
the objective, with an integration time of 100 s, in combination with
a 100× objective magnification) and attenuated total reflectance
Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR, Vertex 70 Bruker, 0.125 cm–1 resolution, 64 scans) spectroscopies. The morphology
of ST/RGO films was evaluated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
with a Jeol JSM 7001F microscope.

Electrical Measurements
and Gas-Sensing Performance
The DC electrical resistivity
of films assembled onto IMEs, henceforth
called simply sensors, was measured as a function of the photoreduction
time with a portable multimeter (Minipa ET1400) operated at room air
and temperature (∼25 °C). The gas-sensing performance
was evaluated with the experimental setup pictured in Figure S7 (Supporting Information). The system
design is basically composed of (i) a PTFE sensor chamber, (ii) a
multiplexer unit, (iii) an impedance analyzer (Instek LCR 821 or Metrohm
Autolab PGSTAT 302N potentiostat provided with the FRA 32 M impedance
module), (iv) a personal computer, (v) a gas flow control panel with
glass rotameters, (vi) a gas-mixing stage, (vii) a RH sensor, and
(viii) a dry N2 cylinder (high purity, Praxair). Measurements
and data acquisition were performed by the personal computer provided
with a virtual instrument created in LabView.

The impedance
spectra of different sensors were recorded with the Metrohm Autolab
PGSTAT 302N potentiostat. Sensors were interrogated by a sinusoidal
excitation voltage (0.25 V), and spectra were recorded between 0.1
Hz and 100 kHz, while they were exposed to analytes in different concentrations:
relative humidity, RH (0–100%); ethanol (0–1000 ppm,
50% RH); ammonia (0–100 ppm, 50% RH); and acetone (0–1000
ppm, 50% RH).

The dynamic responses (resistance and capacitance)
were continuously
monitored while the sensors were cyclically exposed to the blank (N2), the analyte, and the blank (N2) again. For this
experiment, the Instek LCR 821 equipment was employed. The sensors
were excited with the sinusoidal voltage of 0.25 V (maximum amplitude)
solely in 1 kHz. This frequency was chosen among others (100 Hz, 2
kHz, 10 kHz, 100 kHz), since it provided the best signal-to-noise
ratio and better discrimination between analytes and also because
of easy implementation for a future miniaturized device. The responses
were acquired in triplicate and on different days, for each analyte
in different concentrations, as mentioned above.

The generated
data matrix composed of types of sensors (columns)
and analyte responses (rows) was processed by principal component
analysis (PCA) within the Matlab R2016b (MathWorks, MA, EUA) software.
