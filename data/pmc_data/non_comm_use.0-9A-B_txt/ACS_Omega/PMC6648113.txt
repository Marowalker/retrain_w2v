Recently, K-ion batteries
(KIBs) have attracted attention for potential
applications in next-generation energy storage devices principally
on the account of their abundancy and lower cost. Herein, for the
first time, we report an anatase TiO2-derived Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 as a novel anode material for KIBs.
We incorporate pristine carbon nanotube (CNT) on the TiO2 host materials due to the low electronic conductivity of the host
materials. TiO2 transformed to Magnéli phase Ti6O11 after the first insertion/deinsertion of K
ions. From the second cycle, Magnéli phase Ti6O11/CNT composite showed reversible charge/discharge profiles
with ∼150 mA h g–1 at 0.05 A g–1. Ex situ X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
analyses revealed that the charge storage process of Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 proceeded via the conversion reaction
during potassium ion insertion/deinsertion. The Magnéli phase
Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode showed long-term
cycling life over 500 cycles at 200 mA g–1, exhibiting
a capacity retention of 76% and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.9%.
These salient results presented here provide a novel understanding
of the K-ion storage mechanisms in the extensively investigated oxide-based
material for Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, shedding light
on the development of promising electrode materials for next-generation
batteries.

1 Introduction
Li-ion
batteries (LIBs) are primarily used as power sources for
electronic devices and vehicles.1−3 Recently, Na-ion and K-ion batteries
(NIBs and KIBs, respectively) have received considerable attention
as LIB replacements due to the abundance and low cost of Na and K
compared to those of Li resources.4 As
Na and K are in the same group as Li in the periodic table, both NIBs
and KIBs share the same “rocking chair” operation principle
of LIBs.5 The redox potential of Na/Na+ (−2.71 V vs standard hydrogen electrode, noted as
SHE) is higher than that of Li/Li+ (−3.04 V vs SHE);
on the other hand, the redox potential of K/K+ (−2.93
V vs SHE) is closer to that of Li/Li+. Therefore, KIBs
are expected to realize a higher energy density than NIBs due to their
wide working potential.6,7 Since KIBs are still in the initial
stage of development, it is necessary to explore and develop novel
electrode materials for KIBs.

Recently, carbon-based electrode
materials have been investigated
for KIBs anode. For example, graphite is known to intercalate with
K ion to form a stage I intercalation compound KC8 with
a theoretical capacity of 278 mA h g–1.8 The studies of carbon anodes have been extended
to hard and soft carbons,9−12 and reduced graphene oxide.13,14 Inorganic materials such as potassium titanate, Sn, Bi, P, and Sn4P3 are also investigated as anode materials for
KIBs.5,15−21

Anatase TiO2 has been extensively investigated
as an
intercalation anode material for LIBs and NIBs, since it has a three-dimensional
network crystal structure with empty zigzag channels and intercalation
sites for Li and Na ion accommodation and diffusion.22 However, anatase TiO2 has not yet been investigated
as an anode material for KIBs.

Herein, for the first time, we
report TiO2-derived Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 as a novel anode material for KIBs.
We incorporate pristine multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) on TiO2 host materials due to the low electronic conductivity of
the host materials. TiO2 transformed to Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 during the first cycle and Magnéli
phase Ti6O11/CNT composite showed reversible
charge/discharge profiles with ∼150 mA h g–1 at 0.05 A g–1 from the second cycle onward. Ex
situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) analyses revealed that the charge storage process of Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 proceeded via the conversion reaction
during K-ion insertion/deinsertion.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure S1a shows
the X-ray diffraction
(XRD) patterns of TiO2/CNT microspherical composites prepared
by spray-drying method. All the diffraction peaks correspond to the
phase-pure anatase TiO2. The carbon peaks are barely visible,
mainly due to the small amount of CNTs in the composites. According
to the thermogravimetric analysis (Figure S2), the carbon content in the TiO2/CNT composites is 9.4
wt %. Figure S1b shows the microspherical
morphology of the TiO2/CNT composites with particle sizes
of 2–5 μm. The high-magnification cross-sectional SEM
image in Figure S1c shows that CNTs are
uniformly distributed throughout the entire composite, resulting in
an interconnected nanoporous network in the TiO2/CNT composites. Figure S1d clearly depicts that the surfaces
of pristine CNTs are covered with a ∼10 nm layer of TiO2 with an intimate contact. In the present study, titanium
ethoxide was used as the Ti source to precipitate TiO2 layer
on the pristine CNTs.23 The inset in Figure S1d illustrates typical high-resolution
transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) image of the composite with
clear lattice fringes of ∼0.35 nm, which corresponds to the
(101) interplanar spacing of highly crystalline anatase TiO2.22

Figure 1 (a) First three charge/discharge curves
of TiO2/CNT
composite electrode at 0.05 A g–1 and (b) differential
capacity versus voltage curves based on the discharge curves of (a).

Figure 1a shows
the initial three charge/discharge profiles of the TiO2/CNT composite electrode investigated at a current rate of 0.05 A
g–1. The specific capacity of the TiO2/CNT composite was calculated based on the composite weight. The
first discharge and charge capacities were 455 and 191 mA h g–1, respectively, with a Coulombic efficiency of ∼42%.
Nevertheless, reversible charge/discharge profiles were observed in
the subsequent cycles. To clarify the low Coulombic efficiency of
the TiO2/CNT composite electrode, differential capacity
versus voltage curves for the discharge profiles of the TiO2/CNT composite, bare CNTs, and bare TiO2 are plotted in Figures 1b, S4b, and S5b, respectively. In the first potassiation process
of the TiO2/CNT composite (Figure 1b), there are three cathodic peaks at 0.9,
0.6, and 0.1 V versus K/K+. Two peaks at 0.9 and 0.6 V
completely disappeared in the subsequent cycles, which could be responsible
for the low initial Coulombic efficiency of the TiO2/CNT
composite. The comparison of the differential capacity versus voltage
curves of TiO2/CNT composite with those of CNTs and bare
TiO2 clearly indicates that the two peaks at 0.9 and 0.6
V in Figure 1b correspond
to the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation on CNTs (Figure S4b) and the bare TiO2 (Figure S5b), respectively.

Ex situ XRD
analysis was performed to investigate the possible
phase transformation of TiO2 during the initial charge/discharge
process. As shown in Figure 2a, Ti3O5 (18.8°, ICDD No. 01-076-1066)
and K3Ti8O17 (31°, ICDD No.
01-072-1699) newly appeared upon first discharging to 0.9 V. When
further discharged to 0.48 V, Magnéli phase Ti6O11 (26.3, 28.9, and 30.3°, ICDD No. 01-085-1058) was observed.
At the fully discharged state (0.01 V), additional phases of K6Ti2O7 (31.3 and 34.1°; ICDD No.
01-079-1757) and Ti4.5O5 (24.4 and 31.8°;
ICDD No. 01-071-6414) were observed. In the subsequent charging to
0.35 V, the XRD patterns showed little difference from those of the
fully discharged state. When the electrode was charged to 0.85 V,
the K6Ti2O7 and Ti4.5O5 diffraction peaks disappeared. At the fully charged state
(2.5 V), Magnéli phase Ti6O11 was the
major phase with a minor peak of TiO2, indicating most
of the anatase TiO2 underwent electrochemically driven
phase transformation to the Magnéli phase Ti6O11 during the first charge/discharge process. Some unknown
peaks were observed (marked as *) during the course of the first cycle.

Figure 2 Ex situ
XRD patterns of the TiO2/CNT composite electrode
for selected states of charge in the (a) first and (b) second cycle
in the potential window of 0.01–2.5 V vs K/K+ at
a current density of 0.05 A g–1.

Figure 2b shows
the XRD patterns of Magnéli phase Ti6O11 during the charge/discharge process. When Ti6O11 was discharged to 0.48 V, the formation of K6Ti2O7 (31.3°) and Ti4.5O5 (24.4°)
was observed. The XRD patterns of the electrode fully discharged to
0.01 V clearly indicate the presence of K6Ti2O7 (31.3 and 34.1°) and Ti4.5O5 (24.4 and 31.8°). The remained XRD peaks of Ti6O11 might be due to the unreacted part of Ti6O11. During the subsequent charging, K6Ti2O7 and Ti4.5O5 gradually disappeared
and finally Ti6O11 was the major phase in the
fully charged state, which indicates the electrochemical and structural
reversibility of the Magnéli phase Ti6O11 in the K-ion insertion/deinsertion processes. In the second charge/discharge
process cycle, similar unknown peaks were also observed (marked as
*).

Scheme 1 illustrates
two important points regarding the potassiation/depotassiation processes
in the Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode: (i) electrochemically
driven phase transformation of TiO2 to the Ti6O11 Magnéli phase in the first cycle and (ii) reversible
potassiation/depotassiation reactions between Magnéli phase
Ti6O11 and the discharge products of K6Ti2O7 and Ti4.5O5 in
the following cycles. This suggests that potassiation/depotassiation
reactions of Ti6O11 may proceed through the
conversion reaction with K ions, since discharging of Ti6O11 results in the formation of the reduced phase (Ti4.5O5) and the K-ion-rich phase (K6Ti2O7) as discharge products. Interestingly, the charge
storage mechanism of the anatase TiO2 anode in LIBs and
NIBs is the intercalation/de-intercalation process.24,25

Scheme 1 Formation and Potassiation/Depotassiation Mechanism of the Ti6O11/CNT Composite Electrode
When the conversion compounds react with the
alkali ions during
discharge, a reduced phase and an alkali-ion-rich phase are formed
as discharge products. Further, the conversion compounds disintegrate
into nm-sized reduced phase particles in the alkali-ion-rich product
matrix.26−28 To examine the discharge products of the Ti6O11/CNT composite, HR-TEM analyses were carried out for
the Magnéli phase Ti6O11 and its fully
discharged state. The HR-TEM image of the Ti6O11/CNT composite shows the crystalline Ti6O11 lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.29, 0.31, and 0.39 nm, which
corresponded to the (1̅01), (114), and (101) plane, respectively
(Figure S6). A comparison of annular dark
field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) images
of the Ti6O11/CNT composite (Figure 3a) with its fully discharged
state (Figure 3b) clearly
shows the formation of multiple disintegrated nanodomains with bright
contrast in the fully discharged state. The contrast originates from
absorption of electrons by the materials and is thus sensitive to
heavy-element-rich domains during the ADF-STEM image formation.28,29 In Figure 3c, energy-dispersive
spectroscopy line profiles confirms the high concentration of Ti in
the heavy-elements domains. Thus, these disintegrated nanodomains
could be reduced-phase nanoparticle product of the conversion reaction.
The nanodomain’s lattice fringes with a spacing of 0.21 nm
in Figure 3d correspond
to the Ti4.5O5 (130) plane. Another phase with
a lattice spacing of 0.28 nm corresponds to the K6Ti2O7 (102) plane. The TEM analysis results in Figure 3 are in good agreement
with the XRD results in Figure 2, which supports that the conversion reaction is responsible
for the charge storage mechanism of Ti6O11.

Figure 4a
shows
the charge/discharge profiles of the Ti6O11/CNT
composite at a current density of 0.05–3 A g–1, and the charge and discharge capacities with increasing current
density are summarized in Figure 4b. Specific discharge capacities of the Ti6O11/CNT composite were 148, 123, 110, 91, 72, 58, and
39 mA h g–1 at the increasing current densities
of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 A g–1, respectively.
Specific discharge capacity of Ti6O11 in the
Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode was calculated
using the lever rule of the capacities of Ti6O11/CNT composite and CNTs 1  where Ccomposite, CTi6O11, and CCNTs are the capacities of the composite, Ti6O11, and CNTs, respectively, and MTi6O11 and MCNT are the
mass ratios of Ti6O11 and
CNTs in the composite, respectively. On the basis of the XRD analysis,
we assumed that the mass ratio of Ti6O11 in
the Ti6O11/CNT composite is equal to that of
TiO2 in the TiO2/CNT composite. According to
the thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) result in Figure S2, the mass ratio of CNTs in the TiO2/CNT
composite was 9.4 wt %. In our calculation of the specific capacity
of Ti6O11, the mass ratio of Ti6O11 was set at 90.6 wt %. Note that the specific capacities
of CNTs were measured to be 134, 108, 83, 60, 41, 31, and 25 mA h
g–1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 A g–1, respectively (Figure S4d). Finally, specific capacities of Ti6O11 in
the composite were calculated to be 135, 113, 102, 85, 68, 55, and
37 mA h g–1 at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3
A g–1, respectively.

Figure 4 (a) Charge/discharge
curves at increasing current density from
0.05 to 3 A g–1, (b) rate capability, and (c) cycling
performance at 0.2 A g–1 of the Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode.

Interestingly, the electrode composed of bare TiO2 showed
low discharge capacities of 38, 29, 20, and 9–2 mA h g–1 at increasing current density of 0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
0.5, and 1 A g–1, respectively, compared to the
electrode composed of TiO2/CNT composite as a starting
material. Ex situ XRD analysis was also performed to identify the
phases observed during the potassiation/depotassiation of the bare
TiO2 in the initial two cycles (Figure S7). After the first cycle, anatase TiO2 was found
to be the major phase with a minor peak of Magnéli phase Ti6O11, indicating most of the anatase TiO2 did not transform to Magnéli Ti6O11 (Figure S7a). From the second cycle on,
potassiation of the bare TiO2 did not induce any changes
in the XRD patterns (Figure S7b). Accordingly,
no changes in the XRD patterns were observed during the subsequent
depotassiation of the bare TiO2. No information could be
obtained about the potassiation/depotassiation of Magnéli Ti6O11 from the XRD patterns in Figure S7 probably due to the very small amount of Magnéli
Ti6O11. In the case of the TiO2/CNT
composite, CNTs provided electron conduction path ways to the anatase
TiO2. Particle size of the anatase TiO2 in the
bare TiO2 (15–25 nm, Figure S8) is slightly larger than that in the TiO2/CNT
composite (10–15 nm). Thus, the most important difference between
the bare TiO2 and TiO2/CNT composite is the
electron conduction pathways available to the anatase TiO2 in the composite. It might be responsible for the electrochemically
driven phase transformation of the anatase TiO2 in the
composite to the Magnéli phase Ti6O11.

The Ti6O11/CNT composite showed stable
cyclability
over 500 cycles with a capacity retention of 76% and a high Coulombic
efficiency of 99.9% at a current density of 0.2 A g–1 (Figure 4c). Unstable
cycling performance in the early cycles might be due to the instabilities
in the conversion reaction and the SEI formation.10,16,30 At a low current density of 0.05 A g–1 (Figure S9a), the Ti6O11/CNT composite showed a stable cycling behavior
after first 20 cycles with a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.6%. Figure S9b shows the XRD patterns of the Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode at the fully charged
state sampled at increasing number of cycles. It is noted that the
XRD patterns of Ti6O11 were well maintained,
indicating the electrochemical and structural reversibility of the
Magnéli phase Ti6O11 in the K-ion insertion/deinsertion
processes. It is noted that the intensity of the minor peak of TiO2 gradually decreased with increasing number of cycles, which
suggests that capacity fading might be due to the incomplete transformation
of anatase to the Magnéli phase in the initial cycles. Figure S10 shows the plane view SEM image of
the morphology of the Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode
in its pristine state (before cycling) and after 500 cycles. There
is little change of the morphology of Ti6O11/CNT composite in pristine state (Figure S10a) and after 500 cycles (Figure S10b).
In comparison with oxide-based anode materials for KIBs, the Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode exhibited improved
specific capacity, rate capability, and cyclability (Table S1).

3 Conclusions
In summary,
for the first time, we introduce an anatase TiO2-derived
Magnéli phase Ti6O11/CNT composite as
a novel anode material for KIBs. Our investigation
shows that anatase TiO2 transformed to Magnéli phase
Ti6O11 during the insertion/deinsertion of K
ions and revealed that Magnéli phase Ti6O11 proceeded K-ion storage process via the conversion reaction. Magnéli
phase Ti6O11 showed reversible charge/discharge
profiles with ∼150 mA h g–1 at 0.05 A g–1. The Magnéli phase Ti6O11/CNT composite electrode exhibits improved specific capacity, rate
capability, and cyclability compared to the state-of-the-art oxide-based
anodes. These salient results presented here provide a novel understanding
of the K-ion storage mechanisms in the extensively investigated oxide-based
material for LIBs and NIBs, shedding light on the development of promising
electrode materials for next-generation batteries.

4 Methodology
4.1 Synthesis of TiO2/CNT Microspherical
Composite
The TiO2/CNT microspherical composite
were prepared by a one-pot spray-drying process followed by subsequent
heat treatment, which is a modification from our previous work.23 Specifically, the Ti precursor solution was
prepared by dispersing titanium ethoxide (2.24 g, Sigma Aldrich) in
ethanol (50 mL) with magnetic stirring. The CNTs solutions were prepared
by dispersing the as-received MWCNTs (0.1 g, Carbon Nano-material
Technology Co., South Korea) in ethanol (50 mL) with sonication for
1 h. The CNT solutions were mixed with the Ti precursor solution under
vigorous stirring, followed by the addition of deionized water (50
mL). Hydrolysis and condensation reactions of titanium ethoxide started
immediately upon the addition of water. Then, the solution was spray-dried
at 220 °C using a Buchi Mini spray dryer (Buchi Labortechnik
AG, Switzerland). Finally, the spray-dried products were annealed
at 450 °C for 3 h under an Ar atmosphere with a heating rate
of 5 min–1.

4.2 Characterization
X-ray diffraction
(XRD) was performed using a Bruker D8 Advance diffractometer equipped
with a Cu Kα radiation radiation from 5 to 80°. For the
postmortem analysis of the ex situ XRD samples, the electrodes were
detached from the disassembled cells and the electrodes were rinsed
in dimethyl carbonate. The electrodes were dried in the Ar glovebox
to protect against the moisture in the air. Thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA, Mettler Toledo TGA/DSC 1) of TiO2/CNT microspherical
composite was performed in air from 30 to 1000 °C at the heating
rate of 10 °C min–1. The morphologies and microstructures
of the samples were analyzed by field emission scanning electron microscopy
(FE-SEM; JSM-7001F, JEOL Ltd.) and spherical aberration-corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-corrected STEM; JEM-ARM
200F, JEOL Ltd.).

4.3 Electrochemical Measurements
The
working electrodes were prepared by mixing 80 wt % of TiO2/CNT microspherical composite as an active material, 10 wt % of carbon
black as a conductive agent, and 10 wt % of poly(vinylidene fluoride)
(Aldrich) dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidone (Aldrich)
as a binder. Similarly, the bare anatase TiO2 (P25; ∼25
nm) and bare CNTs electrode was also prepared with the same electrode
composition. The mixed slurry was coated on a Cu foil and dried at
100 °C for 24 h. The mass loading of electrodes was controlled
at 1.2 mg cm–2. The electrochemical properties were
measured using coin cells (2032) fabricated with a working electrode
and potassium foil as a counter electrode. The electrolyte was a solution
of 0.8 M KPF6 dissolved in a mixture of ethyl carbonate
and dimethyl carbonate in a volume ratio of 1:1. The galvanostatic
charge–discharge test was performed with a cutoff voltage of
0.01 and 2.5 V using a potentiostat/galvanostat (MPG2, Bio-logic).
