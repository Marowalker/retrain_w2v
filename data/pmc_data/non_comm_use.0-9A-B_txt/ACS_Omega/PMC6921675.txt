Propargylamines are synthesized from methyl vinyl ketone derivatives, 1-alkynes, and secondary amines
catalyzed by Cu salts involving the Michael addition of amine followed
by an unusual C–C bond cleavage and addition of metal acetylides
formed in situ to iminium ions. In this approach, the di-, tri-, and
tetrasubstituted propargylamines are synthesized in 46–98%
yields.

Introduction
Propargylamines are versatile building
blocks widely used in the
synthesis of natural products and bioactive compounds.1−4 Conventional methods of synthesis of propargylamines involve amination
of propargylic halides, phosphates, or triflates5−7 and reaction
of lithium acetylides or Grignard reagents with imines or their derivatives.8,9 However, some of these reagents are highly moisture-sensitive and
hence require strictly controlled reaction conditions. Later, transition-metal-catalyzed
three-component coupling reactions of aldehyde, amine, and alkyne
(A3 coupling) were developed to access propargylamines.10 Methods involving copper(I)-catalyzed addition
of alkynes to enamines,11 microwave-assisted,
three-component coupling reaction of a ketone, alkyne, and primary
amine (KA2 coupling),12 using
amine, acyclic ketone, and 1-alkyne and the catalytic system with
50 mol % of Ti(OEt)4 and 5 mol % of CuCl2,13 and a tandem Markovnikov hydroamination–alkynylation
sequence of reactions for direct access to tetrasubstituted propargylic
amines from an amine and alkyne were also reported (Scheme 1).14

Scheme 1 Overview of the Methods of Synthesis of Propagylamines
Over the years, several synthetic methods were
developed using
aldehydes (or) ketones, 1-alkynes, and amines to access propargylamines.15−19 In continuation of the studies on the synthesis of propargylamines
and their conversion to allenes in this laboratory,20,21 we wish to report herein an unprecedented copper-catalyzed reaction
using methyl vinyl ketone derivatives, 1-alkynes, and secondary amines
to access di-, tri-, and tetrasubstituted propargylamines.

Results and Discussion
Recently, convenient methods
have been developed to access chiral
propargylamines and chiral allenes via CuX- and ZnX2-promoted
transformations.20,21 In continuation of these studies,
we have explored the synthesis of propargylamines via the Michael
addition22 using readily available methyl
vinyl ketone, morpholine, and phenyl acetylene with different metal
salts like ZnCl2, ZnBr2, ZnI2, CuCl,
CuBr, and CuI in various solvents (Table 1).

a The reactions were carried out by
taking morpholine 1a (2.0 mmol), phenyl acetylene 3a (2.2 mmol), and methyl vinyl ketone 2a (2.0
mmol) in toluene (4 mL) at 100 °C for 12 h.

b Isolated yield. NR: No reaction.

Initially, we have carried out the reaction with ZnCl2 at 25 °C in dichloromethane (DCM), CH3CN,
toluene,
and dioxane solvents, but the propargylamine 4a product
was not formed (entries 1–4, Table 1). In reactions using ZnCl2 and
ZnBr2, the corresponding propargylamine 4a was isolated in 25–33% yield in 24 h at 100 °C (entries
5 and 6, Table 1).
Although ZnI2 gave the desired product 4a in
60% yield in 12 h at 100 °C (entry 7, Table 1), use of copper (I) chloride afforded the
propargylamine 4a in 92% yield (entry 8, Table 1). The propargylamine 4a was also formed in similar yields using the CuBr and CuI
under these reaction conditions (entries 9 and 10, Table 1).

Under these optimized
conditions, various secondary amines were
employed in this transformation, and the results are summarized in Table 2. Although the cyclic
amines morpholine (1a), piperidine (1b),
pyrrolidine (1c), N-benzylpiperizine
(1d), and N-phenylpiperizine (1e) gave the corresponding propargylamines 4a–4e in moderate to good yields (53–92%),
diethylamine (1f) gave the desired propargylamine 4f in 52% yield. The reaction of morpholine with aliphatic
1-alkynes also afforded the propargylamines 4g–4l in moderate to good yields (Table 2). It is of interest to note here that the
use of paraformaldehyde, 1-alkyne, and amines under reflux conditions
in dioxane solvent gave the corresponding allenes.23

Table 2 CuCl-Promoted Synthesis of Propargylamines 4 Using Secondary Amines 1a–f, Methyl
Vinyl Ketone 2a, and 1-Alkynesa,b
a The reactions were carried out by
taking amine 1 (2.0 mmol), 1-alkyne 3 (2.2
mmol), and methyl vinyl ketone 2a (2.0 mmol) in toluene
(4 mL) and heating at 100 °C for 12 h.

b Isolated yield.

After developing the method for the preparation of
the propargylamine
derivatives 4, we turned our attention toward the synthesis
of propargylamine derivatives 5 employing 3-pentene-2-one 2b to examine the scope of this method (Table 3). Indeed, the corresponding propargylamine
derivatives 5 are obtained in 70–98% yield (Table 3). The phenyl acetylene
gave the desired propargylamine in 98% yield (5a, Table 3). The substituted
phenylacetylenes like p-fluorophenylacetylene and p-tolylacetylene reacted readily with morpholine and 3-pentene-2-one
to give the corresponding propargylamines 5 in 81–98%
yield (5b and 5c, Table 3). The reaction was also extended to aliphatic
alkynes to access the corresponding propargylamines in 70–96%
yield (5d–5i, Table 3). The 5-cyano-1-pentyne also afforded the
corresponding propargylamine in 82% yield (5j, Table 3). Interestingly,
the reaction of pyrrolidine with 3-pentene-2-one and phenyl acetylene
in dichloromethane solvent gave propargylamine in 65% yield at 25
°C (5k, Table 3).

Table 3 CuCl-Promoted Synthesis of Propargylamines 5 Using Morpholine 1a, 3-Penten-2-one 2b, and 1-Alkynesa,b,c
a The reactions were carried out by
taking amine 1 (2.0 mmol), 1-alkyne 3 (2.2
mmol), and 3-penten-2-one 2b (2.0 mmol) in toluene (4
mL) at 100 °C for 12 h.

b Isolated yield.

c Reaction
was carried out by taking
pyrrolidine 1c (2.0 mmol), 1-alkyne 3 (2.2
mmol), and 3-penten-2-one 2b (2.0 mmol) in DCM solvent
at 25 °C for 12 h.

Finally, we have also examined the reaction of pyrrolidine 1c with mesityl oxide 2c and 1-alkynes in the
presence of CuCl (10 mol %) to prepare the propargylamine deivatives 6 with two methyl groups. The corresponding propargylamine
deivatives 6 were obtained in 46–77% yield at
25 °C, and the results are summarized in Table 4.

Table 4 CuCl-Promoted Synthesis of Propargylamines 6 Using Pyrrolidine 1c, Mesityloxide 2c, and 1-Alkynesa,b
a The reactions were carried out by
taking amine 1c (2.0 mmol), 1-alkyne 3 (2.2
mmol), and mesityloxide 2c (2.0 mmol) in DCM (4 mL) at
25 °C about 6–12 h.

b Isolated yield.

The CuCl-catalyzed formation of propargylamines 4a may be rationalized by the tentative mechanism involving
intermediates
outlined in Scheme 2. The cyclic secondary amine would first react with methyl vinyl
ketone 2a in a Michael fashion. The corresponding Michael
adduct 7 would then undergo C–C bond cleavage
to give the iminium intermediate 8. A subsequent addition
of copper acetylide formed in situ to iminium ion would give the propargylamine 4a with regeneration of the copper catalyst.

Scheme 2 Tentative
Mechanism for the CuCl-Catalyzed Synthesis of Propargylamines
We have carried out several experiments to further
understand the
mechanism, intermediates, scope, and limitations of this transformation.
We have observed that when the reaction of morpholine 1a was carried out using methyl vinyl ketone 2a in polyethylene
glycol (PEG) solvent at 25 °C,22b the
corresponding Michael addition product 7 was isolated,
which upon reaction with phenyl acetylene 3a and CuCl
(10 mol %) at 100 °C gave the propargylamine 4a in
65% yield (Scheme 3).

Scheme 3 Reaction of Michael Adduct Intermediate 7 with
Phenyl
Acetylene 3a and CuCl
Also, the reaction of morpholine 1a with 1-phenylprop-2-en-1-one 2d and phenyl acetylene 3a in toluene solvent
at 100 °C gave the propargylamine 4a in 52% yield
along with the acetophenone 11 (33% y) byproduct (Scheme 4). Clearly, these
transformations go through the C–C bond cleavage of the Michael
adduct 7 as outlined in Scheme 2.

Scheme 4 Synthesis of Propargylamine 4a Using Morpholine 1a, 1-Phenylprop-2-en-1-one 2d, and Phenyl Acetylene 3a with CuCl
Interestingly, the reaction of primary amines
like benzylamine 12 with methyl vinyl ketone 1a and phenyl acetylene 3a in the presence of CuCl in
toluene at 100 °C gave
the 3-substituted-N-benzylpiperidine product 13 instead of the expected propargylamine derivative. The
product 13 was obtained in 85% yield in the reaction
of benzylamine (1 equiv) with methyl vinyl ketone (2 equiv) in a double
Michael addition, followed by aldol reaction sequence (Scheme 5).

Scheme 5 Synthesis of 1-(1-Benzyl-4-hydroxy-4-methylpiperidin-3-yl)
Ethanone 13 Using Benzylamine 12 Methyl
Vinyl Ketone 1a with CuCl
In the case of the reaction of trimethylsilyl-substituted
terminal
acetylene with CuCl, morpholine, and methyl vinyl ketone in toluene
at 100 °C, only the corresponding Michael addition product 7 was obtained. These results may illustrate the scope and
limitations of the CuCl-catalyzed propargylamine synthesis using terminal
alkynes and methyl vinyl ketone derivatives.

Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a CuCl-promoted
method for the synthesis
of propargylamines using amines, α,β-unsaturated ketones,
and 1-alkynes via Michael addition followed by C–C bond cleavage
to iminium-ion intermediates and subsequent addition of the in situ
formed copper acetylides. This method utilizes the inexpensive CuCl
as catalyst, and it is applicable to both aromatic and aliphatic alkynes
and also to various secondary amines to produce di-, tri-, tetrasubstituted
propargylamines in a single-pot synthetic operation. Propargylamines
are one of the important classes of intermediates and attractive starting
materials for the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles, natural products,
and biologically active compounds.24 Hence,
the method of synthesis for propargylamines described here has a significant
synthetic potential.

Experimental Section
General Information
IR (neat) spectra were recorded
with polystyrene as reference. 1H NMR (400 MHz) and 13C{1H} NMR (100 MHz) spectra were recorded with
chloroform-d as solvent and TMS as reference (δ = 0 ppm). The
chemical shifts are expressed in δ downfield from the signal
of internal TMS. High-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS) images were
recorded on micromass electrospray ionization time-of-flight (ESI-TOF).
All of the chemicals used were commercially available. Toluene was
freshly distilled over sodium-benzophenone ketyl before use. Analytical
thin-layer chromatographic tests were carried out on glass plates
(3 × 10 cm2) coated with 250 mμ silica gel-G
and GF-254 containing 13% calcium sulfate as binder. The spots were
visualized by a short exposure to iodine vapor or UV light. Column
chromatography was carried out using silica gel (100–200 mesh).

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Propargylamines
In a 10 mL RB flask, CuCl (0.020 g, 0.2 mmol), amine 1 (2.0 mmol), α,β-unsaturated ketone 2a, b (2.0 mmol), and 1-alkyne 3 (2.2 mmol) were
taken in 4 mL of toluene at 25 °C under N2 atmosphere,
and the contents were stirred at 100 °C for 12 h. Toluene was
removed, and water (5 mL) and DCM (15 mL) were added. The DCM layer
was washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using hexane and ethylacetate
(80:20) as eluent to isolate the propargylamine derivatives 4 and 5.

Procedure for the Synthesis of Propargylamine 4a from the Michael
Adduct Intermediate 7
A mixture of amine 1a (2
mmol), methyl vinyl ketone 2a (3 mmol), and PEG 400 (5
g) was placed in 25 mL round-bottom flask. The contents were stirred
at room temperature until the reaction was complete. The crude mixture
was extracted with ether. The ether layer was concerted and purified
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using hexane and ethylacetate
(50:50) as an eluent to obtain the adduct in excellent yield.22b To a stirred solution of freshly prepared Michael
adduct 7 (0.157 g, 1 mmol) in toluene (3 mL), phenyl
acetylene 3a (0.16 mL, 1.5 mmol) and CuCl (0.010 g, 0.1
mmol) were added, and the contents were stirred at 100 °C for
12 h. Toluene was removed, and water (5 mL) and DCM (10 mL) were added.
The DCM layer was washed with saturated NaCl solution, dried with
Na2SO4, and concentrated. The residue was chromatographed
on silica gel (100–200 mesh) using hexane and ethylacetate
(80:20) as eluent to isolate 4a.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of 1-(1-benzyl-4-hydroxy-4-methylpiperidin-3-yl)
Ethanone 13
In a 10 mL RB flask, CuCl (0.010 g, 0.1 mmol),
benzylamine 12 (0.1 mL, 1.0 mmol), and methyl vinyl ketone 2a (0.16 mL, 2.0 mmol) were taken in 4 mL of toluene at 25
°C under N2 atmosphere, and the contents were stirred
at 100 °C for 3 h. Toluene was removed, and water (5 mL) and
DCM (15 mL) were added. The DCM layer was washed with saturated NaCl
solution, dried with Na2SO4, and concentrated.
The residue was chromatographed on silica gel (100–200 mesh)
using hexane and ethylacetate (50:50) as eluent to isolate the product 13.
