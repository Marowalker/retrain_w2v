The aggregation or misfolding of amyloid-β (Aβ) is a major pathological
hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The regulation of Aβ
aggregation is thought to be an effective strategy for AD treatment.
The capability of a water-soluble porphyrin, 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP), to inhibit Aβ
aggregation and to lower Aβ-induced toxicity was demonstrated.
As evidenced by surface plasmon resonance and circular dichroism,
TMPyP can not only disrupt Aβ aggregation but also disassemble
the preformed Aβ aggregates. The atomic force microscopy imaging
proves that TMPyP inhibits the formation of both oligomers and fibrils.
Molecular dynamic simulations provide an insight into the interaction
between TMPyP and Aβ at the molecular level. The half-maximal
inhibitory concentrations of TMPyP acting on the oligomers and fibrils
were determined to be 0.6 and 0.43 μM, respectively. As a member
of porphyrin family, TMPyP is of rather low cytotoxicity, and the
cytotoxicity of the Aβ aggregates was also relieved upon coincubation
with TMPyP. The excellent performance of TMPyP thus makes it a potential
drug candidate for AD therapy.

==== Body
Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is one
of the common neurodegenerative
disorders characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ)
in brain.1,2 Aβ is composed of 39–42 amino
acids and produced by the cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein
(APP) by β- and γ-secretases.3 The aggregation of Aβ leads to the formation of fibrillar
deposits known as senile plaques. The amyloid aggregates, which are
self-assembled from misfolded Aβ, have been presumed to affect
the structure and function of neuronal cells and to stimulate cell
apoptosis, leading to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration.4,5

The suppression of Aβ production or inhibition of Aβ
aggregation is considered as potential strategies for preventing and
treating AD.1 The production of Aβ
can be suppressed by decreasing the expression of APP6 or inhibiting the activity of β- and γ-secretases.7,8 On the other hand, once generated, Aβ is readily aggregated,
and the development of effective inhibitors against Aβ aggregation
or drug candidates that dissociate toxic Aβ aggregates plays
an important role in AD treatment.9,10 Short peptides
(β-sheet breaker peptides)11,12 and small
organic molecules8,13−16 have been explored for their
inhibitory abilities. For example, short peptides of Aβ(17–21)
(LVFFA)11,12 and Aβ(39–42) (VVIA)17 have been shown to reduce Aβ aggregation
and to alleviate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity. Small molecules,
such as anthocyanins,18 resveratrol,15 carotenoid,16 and
tabersonine,8 have proven to inhibit amyloid
fibrillation via specific aromatic and hydrophobic interactions. However,
peptide-based inhibitors are difficult to cross the blood–brain
barrier (BBB) and most small-molecule-based modulators are not suitable for AD therapy
due to their high cytotoxicity.9 Developing
less cytotoxic and BBB-permeable therapeutic candidates for AD is
still a challenge.

Porphyrins possess physiological activity
and widely exist in organisms.19 Howlett
et al. found that the heme-related porphyrins
could inhibit Aβ aggregation, leading to reduced cytotoxicity.20 The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 0.2 μM was attained for the inhibition of Aβ
aggregation by ferric dehydroporphyrin IX.21 The perturbation of Aβ aggregation was ascribed to the π–π
interactions between the porphyrin ring of heme and the Phe19 residue of Aβ.22 The regulation of Aβ aggregation by photosensitizing meso-tetra(4-sulfonatophenyl)phorphyrin (TPPS) was also
reported and TPPS could suppress the neural cell death and synaptic
toxicity.23 However, some of the porphyrins
are insoluble and not easily absorbed by human bodies. To develop
water-soluble drug candidates with good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity
and to further unravel the interaction mechanism between porphyrins
and Aβ, the effect of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)porphyrin (TMPyP), a planar and water-soluble cationic
porphyrin, on the aggregation properties of Aβ was examined
in detail.

Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is highly sensitive
to the tiny
changes in the refractive index or thickness associated with a biomolecular
interaction.24 By immobilizing the capture
antibodies that are specific to the Aβ oligomers and fibrils
in separate fluidic channels, an SPR assay for real-time monitoring
of Aβ aggregation was proposed by our group.25 In this study, the inhibition of Aβ aggregation and
dismantling of the preformed Aβ aggregates by TMPyP were investigated
by SPR and other methods. The possible binding sites of TMPyP to Aβ
were determined by molecular dynamic simulations at the molecular
level.

Results and Discussion
TMPyP Inhibits Aβ Aggregation and Dismantles
the Aggregates
Amyloid aggregation and the inhibition effect
of TMPyP were first
monitored by thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence assay9 (Figure 1A). As shown by the black curve, the fluorescence intensity of ThT
upon incubation with 6.2 μM Aβ increased with the incubation
time, and a plateau was reached beyond 48 h. When 6.2 μM TMPyP
was coincubated with 6.2 μM Aβ, a much lower fluorescence
intensity of ThT was attained (red curve), indicating that TMPyP interfered
with ThT binding to amyloid fibrils. Similar trend was obtained in
the case of TMPyP alone (blue curve). As can be seen by the magenta
curve, the incubation of TMPyP with the preaggregated TMPyP (2 h)
leads to a lower fluorescence intensity in comparison with that of
Aβ alone (black curve), indicating that TMPyP was capable of
dismantling the preformed fibrils. The ThT fluorescence assay is useful
for monitoring the progression of fibril formation; however, it is
not an effective tool for the detection of soluble and neurotoxic
oligomers. Time-dependent SPR sensorgrams at the sensor chips preimmobilized
with A11 antibody (Figure 1B) and OC antibody (Figure 1C) were acquired upon injection of the incubated samples.
The A11 and OC antibodies were capable of recognizing the oligomers
and fibrils of Aβ, respectively.25−27 The Aβ samples
with (red curves) and without (black curves) TMPyP were serially flowed
over the two channels and the amount of the bound species was measured
by examining the difference in the baseline SPR angles before and
after the injection. The nonspecific adsorption (2–3 mDeg)
was subtracted upon injection of the incubated samples onto the 11-mercaptoundecanoic
acid (MUA)-covered sensor chips. In the absence of TMPyP, the SPR
signals of 20 mDeg in curve a of Figure 1B and 15 mDeg in curve a of Figure 1C were attained, indicating
that the Aβ samples are monomer-dominated at the time point
of 0 h, although some oligomers and fibrils were preformed during
the storage. Upon incubation of the Aβ samples alone for 6 h,
the significantly increased SPR signals in both channels suggest the
formation of well-ordered oligomers and fibrils (curve b in Figure 1B,C). Interestingly,
the incubation of Aβ with TMPyP for 6 h remarkably decreased
the SPR signals (curve c in Figure 1B,C), suggesting that TMPyP could inhibit Aβ
oligomerization and fibrillation. Such an inhibition process could
be interpreted as follows: TMPyP inhibits the formation of Aβ
oligomers, and the lowered levels of the oligomers prevent the fibril
formation. Furthermore, we noticed that upon incubation of the preaggregated
Aβ (6 h) with TMPyP for 2 h, the smaller SPR signals in curve
d than those in curve b of Figure 1B,C indicate that TMPyP could dismantle the mature
aggregates of Aβ. Taken together, TMPYP could not only inhibit
Aβ aggregation but also disrupt the preformed aggregates.

μM Aβ at 37 °C in the absence (black curve) and presence

with the addition of 6.2 μM TMPyP into the preaggregated Aβ
(2 h). The blue curve corresponds to the case of 6.2 μM TMPyP.

concentration of Aβ was incubated in the absence (curves a and

b and c) in 10 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 37 °C. The SPR
sensorgram acquired upon incubation of the preaggregated Aβ
(6 h) with TMPyP for 2 h is shown as curve d.

Influence of TMPyP on the Secondary Structure of Aβ
Next, we assessed the conformational change of Aβ in the
absence (Figure 2A)
and presence (Figure 2B) of TMPyP by circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. At 0 h, Aβ
exhibits natively unstructured conformation, as evidenced by the characteristic
peak at 197 nm (curve a in Figure 2A). After incubation for 3 h, the disappearance of
the 197 nm peak is accompanied by the appearance of a new negative
peak at 215 nm (curve b in Figure 2A), which indicates the formation of β-sheet-structured
oligomers.5 However, in the presence of
TMPyP, Aβ reserves the unstructured conformation at 0 h (curve
a in Figure 2B), and
after incubation with TMPyP for 3 h, the negative peak at 215 nm disappears
(curve b in Figure 2B). Most dramatically, upon incubation of the preincubated Aβ
(3 h) with TMPyP for 2 h, less β-sheet aggregates with much
attenuated negative peak at 215 nm were produced (curve c in Figure 2B), suggesting that
TMPyP could slow down the formation of the β-sheet structures.
Thus, TMPyP serves as a potent inhibitor of the β-sheet formation
(i.e., dimerization and oligomerization), as characterized by CD and
SPR results. The contention was also supported by UV–vis spectroscopy
(Figure 2C). Aβ
does not show any absorbance peak over the wavelength range examined
(curve a). The incorporation of 10 μM Aβ into 10 μM
TMPyP shifted the absorbance peak of TMPyP from 422 to 429 nm (curves
b and c), suggesting the π–π interactions between
the porphyrin ring and Aβ.28 It has
been documented that the porphyrin ring plays an important role in
the prevention of Aβ aggregation by heme.22,28

Morphology of the Aβ
Aggregates with and without TMPyP
The Aβ aggregates
with and without TMPyP were clearly resolved
from atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging (Figure 3). Monomeric Aβ is soluble, and no
aggregates were formed (Figure 3A). After 12 h incubation, spherical particles with diameters
of about 2.5 nm were observed (Figure 3B). With the increase in the incubation time to 36
h, long, mature fibrils of Aβ with the nominal height of 5–6
nm were attained (Figure 3C). However, the morphology of the Aβ aggregates in
the presence of TMPyP is totally different from that of Aβ alone.
Few spherical particles were formed via incubating Aβ with TMPyP
at a concentration ratio of 1:1 for 12 h (Figure 3E). With the elapse of the incubation time
to 36 h, the spherical particles were still resolved and no fibrils
were obtained (Figure 3F). It is clear that the incorporation of TMPyP prevents the Aβ
monomers from further growing into oligomers or fibrils, consistent
with our aforementioned experimental results. Note that the incubation
time for AFM imaging is much longer than that for SPR and CD characterizations.
The conversion of the unstructured Aβ to β-sheet containing
structures, such as dimers, is a quick process, and these small Aβ
oligomers could be recognized by the antibodies preimmobilized on
the SPR chips. Because AFM only images well-formed oligomers and fibrils,
the small Aβ oligomers could not be detected by AFM.

of 25
μM Aβ in the absence (top) and presence (bottom) of 25
μM TMPyP at 0 h (A, D), 12 h (B, E), and 36 h (C, F).

IC50 of TMPyP
Inhibitor
The inhibition assay
of TMPyP on the formation of Aβ oligomers (A) and fibrils (B)
was conducted (Figure 4). The SPR signals as a function of TMPyP concentrations were measured
and the concentration of TMPyP that causes 50% inhibition (IC50) was deduced. The IC50 values of 0.6 and 0.43
μM for TMPyP acting on the oligomers and fibrils, respectively,
were attained, being lower than those of the porphyrin derivatives
(3.56 and 11.0 μM)29 and other inhibitors,
such as hematoxylin (1.6 μM)30 and
brazilin (2.3 μM)30. It is worth
noting that TMPyP suppresses the formation of both oligomers and fibrils,
serving as a novel bifunctional inhibitor of Aβ aggregation.
Fe-TMPyP possesses similar but weaker inhibition effect, which indicates
that the metal ion center of porphyrins may not play an important
role in inhibiting Aβ aggregation. However, several reports
indicate that the metal ions, such as Zn2+ and Cu2+, play an important role in AD pathogenesis;31−33 thus, chelating
metal ions is another way for the prevention of Aβ aggregation
and the cure of AD.

Figure 4 Dependence of the SPR responses on the concentrations
of TMPyP.
Ten micromolar concentration of Aβ was incubated with various
concentrations of TMPyP for 6 h and the above solutions were flowed
over the SPR chips precovered with A11 antibody (A) and OC antibody
(B).

TMPyP Alleviates Aβ-Induced
Cytotoxicity
The
cell cytotoxicity of Aβ in the absence and presence of TMPyP
was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay34 (Figure 5). Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with Aβ,
TMPyP, and the mixture of Aβ with different concentrations of
TMPyP for 24 h and the survival rates were determined. It was found
that only 71% of the cells remained viable when exposed to 20 μM
Aβ for 24 h (lane 2), indicating the cytotoxictity of the Aβ
aggregates. However, due to the inhibition effect of TMPyP on Aβ
aggregation, reduced cytotoxicity (97%) was obtained when the cells
were treated with the mixture of 20 μM Aβ and 20 μM
TMPyP (lane 3). The decrease in the concentrations of TMPyP leads
to a lowered cell viability (lanes 4–6), and the survival rate
of the cells in the case of 20 μM Aβ and 2 μM TMPyP
(lane 6) is similar with that in the presence of Aβ alone (lane
2). TMPyP possesses low toxicity and the survival rate is approximately
94% (lane 7). The cell viability assay was consistent with the SPR
results in that TMPyP inhibits Aβ aggregation in a dose-dependent
manner.

Figure 5 CCK-8 viability assay of human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated
with 20 μM Aβ (lane 2), 20 μM TMPyP (lane 7), and
the mixture of 20 μM Aβ with different concentrations
of TMPyP (lanes 3, 4, 5, and 6 correspond to 20, 10, 4, and 2 μM
TMPyP, respectively) for 24 h. The SH-SY5Y cells in the cell media
were taken as 100% viable (lane 1).

Binding Modes of TMPyP to Aβ
To gain a better
understanding of the inhibition mechanism, we performed all-atom molecular
dynamic simulations to study the binding modes of TMPyP to the Aβ
pentamer (Figure 6).
It can be clearly seen that TMPyP does not disturb the structural
integrity of the Aβ pentamer within 30 ns. TMPyP preferentially
binds to the N-terminus and the salt-bridge region of Aβ. These
results suggest that the attachment of TMPyP to the Aβ pentamer
hinders the elongation and lateral aggregation of the pentamer.

Possible Binding Sites of TMPyP to Aβ
The inhibition
mechanism and the possible binding sites were further demonstrated
by molecular dynamic simulations (Figure 7). The Aβ pentamer–TMPyP complex
was clustered into different structural groups using a root-mean-square
deviation of 10 Å as the cutoff value, and highly populated binding
sites at Ser8-His13 (region 1, 31.6%), Phe4-Ser8 (region 2, 10.6%), Asn27-Ile31 (region 3, 7.4%), Ala30-Leu34 (region
4, 6.2%), Ser8-Val12 (region 5, 6.2%), and Val39-Ala42 (region 6, 5.8%) were attained. TMPyP preferentially
binds to the aromatic residues of Aβ, such as Phe4, Phe6, and Tyr10 through π–π
interactions (regions 1, 2, and 5), which interferes with the ordered
stacking of the β-sheets for the formation of large oligomers
and fibrils.35,36 Because the hydrophobic region
at the C-terminus of Aβ is capable of initiating the self-assembly
of Aβ,37 the binding of TMPyP to
the hydrophobic pocket (regions 3, 4, and 6) thus interferes with
its aggregation (consistent with our AFM and SPR results). Furthermore,
TMPyP binds to Asn27-Ile31 of Aβ (region
3), disrupting the β-sheet structure stabilized by the salt-bridge
region (Asp23-Lys28) (supported by our CD data).38,39 Taken together, the insertion of TMPyP into the hydrophobic and
salt-bridge regions not only inhibits the self-aggregation of Aβ
but also disrupts the β-sheet formation. As a result, the elongation
of the Aβ aggregates is largely prevented.

from the pentamer are shown as gray spheres.

and Val39-Ala42 (region 6, 5.8%). Shown in the
parenthesis are the percentages of the total population.

Conclusions
Via the specific recognition
of the preimmobilized A11 and OC antibodies
to the oligomers and fibrils, respectively, an SPR assay of the inhibition
of Aβ aggregation by TMPyP has been proposed. TMPyP not only
inhibits Aβ aggregation but also disassembles the preformed
Aβ aggregates. The SPR results were further confirmed by CD,
AFM, and molecular dynamic simulation characterizations. The inhibition
effect might be ascribed to the π−π interactions
between Aβ and TMPyP and the insertion of TMPyP into the hydrophobic
and salt-bridge regions of Aβ, which interferes its aggregation
and disrupts the β-sheet structure stabilized by the salt-bridge
region. The IC50 values for TMPyP acting on the oligomers
and fibrils were estimated to be 0.6 and 0.43 μM, respectively,
being lower than those of the porphyrin derivatives and other inhibitors,
such as hematoxylin and brazilin. As a member of porphyrin family,
TMPyP possesses low cytotoxicity, and the cytotoxicity of the Aβ
aggregates was relieved upon the incorporation of TMPyP. Thus, TMPyP
not only inhibits Aβ aggregation but also alleviates amyloid-induced
cytotoxicity, providing a new insight for the development of porphyrin-based
therapeutic drugs for neurodegenerative diseases.

Experimental
Section
Chemicals and Reagents
MUA, ethanolamine (EA), K2HPO4, KH2PO4, NaOH, N-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-N′-ethylcarbodiimide
hydrochloride (EDC), N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS),
and TMPyP were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Aβ(1–42)
was obtained from Bachem (Torrance, CA). Monoclonal antibodies against
oligomers and fibrils of Aβ (A11 and OC, respectively) were
obtained from Millipore Inc. (Dedham, MA). All of the reagents were
of analytical grade and used without further purification. Unless
otherwise stated, all of the stock solutions were prepared daily with
deionized water treated with a water purification system (Simplicity185;
Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA).

Solution Preparation
To effectively inhibit the aggregation
of Aβ(1–42), lyophilized Aβ(1–42) samples
were dissolved in 10 mM NaOH solution. Upon sonication for 1 min,
the solution was centrifuged at 13 000 rpm for 30 min to remove
any insoluble particles, and the supernatants were pipetted out and
diluted by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 100 mM phosphate, pH 7.4).
Aβ(1–42) or the mixture of Aβ(1–42) and
TMPyP was incubated at 37 °C for different time periods before
assay. OC and A11 antibodies were prepared with PBS buffer and their
concentrations were maintained at 2 nM. TMPyP was dissolved in 20
mM NaOH solution. MUA and EA were dissolved in ethyl alcohol and water,
respectively. EDC/NHS solution was prepared by mixing 0.4 M EDC and
0.1 M NHS in water before the activation of MUA self-assembled monolayers
(SAMs).

SPR Detection
SPR assay was performed on a BI-3000
system (Biosensing Instrument Inc., Tempe, AZ). Au films coated onto
BK7 glass slides were annealed in a hydrogen flame to eliminate surface
contaminants. The treated Au films were immersed in 500 μM MUA
solution for 24 h and the SAMs were gently rinsed with ethanol, water,
and dried under nitrogen. For antibody immobilization, 200 μL
EDC/NHS solution was injected onto the sensor chip for activation
of the carboxyl groups on MUA, followed by the injection of A11 antibody
on channel 1 and OC antibody on channel 2. Both channels were treated
with 1 M EA to block the empty sites. The incubated Aβ(1–42)
or the mixture of Aβ(1–42) and TMPyP was injected into
the flow cell at a flow rate of 20 μL/min.

CD Characterization
CD spectra were collected on a
J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc., Tokyo) from 260 to 190 nm at
a 0.5 nm interval at room temperature. Each spectrum is the average
of six scans.

AFM Imaging
AFM images of Aβ
incubated with and
without TMPyP for a predetermined time period were obtained on a NanoIR2
system (Anasys Instruments Corporation, Santa Barbara, CA). The scanning
speed was 0.5 Hz.

CCK-8 Assay
Human neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells with
a density of 1 × 105 cells/well were seeded in triplicate
in 0.1 mL culture medium in a 96-well plate that was incubated in
a humidified atmosphere containing 5% (v/v) CO2 at 37 °C
overnight. Next, 20 μM Aβ(1–42) or the mixture
of 20 μM Aβ(1–42) with various concentrations of
TMPyP was added to the cells and kept for 24 h. The SH-SY5Y cells
in the cell media were used as the control. After washing and pipetting
100 μL culture medium containing 10 μL CCK-8 solution
into each well, the wells were incubated for 1 h for formazan formation.
The absorbance of the suspensions was measured on a microplate reader.
The cell viability was attained by the percentage absorbance of Aβ(1–42)-treated
groups or Aβ(1–42)/TMPyP-treated groups relative to that
of the control group.

Molecular Dynamic System Construction
A complete structure
of Aβ pentamer was modeled to probe the TMPyP binding sites
and modes. Briefly, the initial monomer coordinates of an Aβ(17–42)
peptide were derived from the NMR structure (protein data bank code 2BEG) and then the unresolved
N-terminus (residues 1–16) was constructed and reassembled
to Aβ(17–42) to yield a full-length Aβ(1–42)
monomer with the β hairpin structure. The whole structure of
Aβ monomer consists of two antiparallel β-strands (residues
Val1-Ser26 and Ile31-Ala42) linked by a U-bend (residues Asn27-Ala30).
The Aβ pentamer was constructed manually by stacking five monomers
in parallel and registered form according to the NMR structure. To
eliminate the potential collisions and gain a more reasonable initial
structure, the oligomer was subjected to a molecular mechanics optimization.
Five TMPyP molecules were initially and randomly placed around the
relaxed Aβ pentamer with a minimal distance of 10 Å to
allow them to land on optimal binding sites. The Aβ pentamer–TMPyP
complex was then immersed in a cuboid box filled with TIP3P water
molecules, leaving at least a 12 Å buffering zone away from any
boundary of the box. Each system was neutralized by adding Cl– counter ions.

Molecular Dynamic Simulation
Simulation of the Aβ
pentamer–TMPyP complex containing explicit water molecules
and counter ions was performed using the AmberTools14 program (sander
module) with the Amber ff14SB force field for protein and generalized
AMBER force field for ligands. Restrained electrostatic potential
charges for TMPyP were obtained with the PyRED server using Gaussian
09 (rev. D.01). The simulation begins with a three-phase energy minimization.
In the beginning, 10 kcal/mol Å2 elastic constant
was used to constrain the heavy atoms of the solute for 2000 cycles,
followed by another 2000 cycles with the same position constraints
on the backbone atoms of Aβ; finally, the whole system was relaxed
without any constrain for 4000 cycles. After energy minimization,
the system was gradually heated from 50 to 310 K in 50 ps and equilibrated
at 310 K for 150 ps to adjust the size and density. Finally, 30 ns
production molecular dynamic runs were conducted to examine the mutual
dynamics and binding events between Aβ and TMPyP. A time step
of 2 fs was used to integrate the equations of motion, permitted by
constraining the fast stretching of the hydrogen atoms covalently
linked to the heavy atoms. The Coulomb potentials were handled by
the smooth particle-mesh Ewald method with a direct space cutoff of
9.0 Å. The same threshold value was also used for the truncation
of the Lennard–Jones potentials, whereas long-range analytic
corrections were applied to the energy and pressure. Molecular dynamic
trajectories were saved every 2 ps for subsequent analyses. All of
the calculations were performed on the MolDesigner Molecular Simulation
Platform.
