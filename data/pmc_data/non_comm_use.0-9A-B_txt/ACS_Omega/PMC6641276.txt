We
computationally proved that the planar aromatic hexagonal isomer
N3P3 with the alteration of N and P is the second
most stable structure for the N3P3 stoichiometry.
We found that the aromatic isomer has high barriers for transition
into the global minimum structure or into the three isolated NP molecules,
making this structure kinetically stable. We showed that the sandwich
N3P3CrN3P3 molecule corresponds
to a minimum on the potential energy surface; thus, the aromatic N3P3 molecule has a potential to be a new ligand
in chemistry.

1 Introduction
Hexaazabenzene
N6 and hexaphosphabenzene P6 are valence isoelectronic
analogues of benzene, and therefore, one
may think that they should have a planar hexagonal structure due to
aromaticity. However, both of these species have turned out to be
unstable at the D6h planar structures.
A significant amount of theoretical work was dedicated to assess the
stability and aromaticity of planar hexagonal N6 as a potential
6π-aromatic system.1 According to
the most accurate calculations of the geometry and frequencies of
the planar hexagon structure performed by Roos and co-workers2 and Tobita and Bartlett3 at the CASPT2/BS2 and CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ levels of theory, respectively,
the D6h form of N6 was found
to be a second-order saddle point. Geometry optimization along imaginary
modes leads to a slightly distorted D2 cyclic structure 0.25 kcal mol–1 (CASPT2/BS2)2 lower in energy than the D6h structure.
Moreover, it dissociates without any barrier into three N2 molecules. Roos and co-workers concluded that the planar cyclic
form of N6 is not stable. Tobita and Bartlett3 found that the D2 structure is a local minimum with a low vibration frequency (73.6
cm–1) leading to dissociation and also concluded
that the structure may easily dissociate into three N2 units.3 Therefore, the benzene-like form of N6 is unlikely to exist.

It is a different story for the P6 molecule. In 1985,
Scherer et al.4 obtained a triple-decker
sandwich complex {(μ5-Me5C5)Mo}2(μ,η6-P6) containing
a planar P6 ring with equal P–P bond lengths. However,
theoretical calculations showed that at least 10 nonplanar P6 isomers (Figure 1) were lower in energy than the planar benzene-like D6h structure.5−15

Figure 1 Representative
optimized structures of P6, their point
group symmetries, spectroscopic states, and zero-point energy (ZPE)-corrected
(B3LYP/6-311+G*) relative energies. Reproduced from ref (15).

According to the most accurate calculations by Hiberty and
Volatron14 and by Galeev and Boldyrev,15 the global minimum of P6 is the benzvalene-like
structure I.1. The prismane-like isomer I.2 is the second lowest one, and the other isomers lie significantly
higher in energy. Moreover, the D6h structure I.11 is not even a local minimum but a second-order saddle
point. Geometry optimization along the imaginary modes leads to the
distorted structure I.10 (D2, 1A). The rearrangement of I.11 into I.10 along the e2u doubly degenerate frequency
mode occurs because of the pseudo Jahn–Teller effect resulting
from vibronic coupling of highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
– 1 (e2g) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(LUMO) (e2u).15

On the
basis of these data, one may think that the mixed aromatic
NxP6–x (x = 1–5) molecules would hardly be stable.
However, a recent synthesis of the mixed P2N3– cyclic aromatic anion in a solid state by Velian
and Cummins16 gives us hope that some of
the mixed NxP6–x molecules could be viable. Probably the most surprising fact
is that the N3P3X6 derivatives of
the N3P3 molecule are well-known in chemistry.17−28 Yet, the isolated N3P3 molecule is very elusive.
There are three publications on the structure and aromaticity of the
1,3,5-triphosphazatriene.29−31 The authors of the first two
articles focused on the planar 1,3,5-triphosphazatriene isomer, and
they concluded that this molecule is planar and aromatic. There is
also a joint experimental and theoretical work31 on 1,3,5-triphosphazatriene, in which an observation of
this molecule under the matrix isolation conditions is reported, but
the relative stability of this isomer with respect to alternative
structures was not studied. In this work, we explored the isomerism
of the N3P3 stoichiometry and evaluated the
viability of the N3P3 aromatic molecule as a
potential new ligand in inorganic chemistry.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Stability of the Aromatic
N3P3 Molecule
The lowest isomers of
N3P3 are shown in Figure 2. According to our PBE0/3-21G initial global
minimum search
using the Coalescence-Kick method, the high symmetry D3h singlet structure is the global minimum. The complex
of NP3 distorted tetrahedron and N2 molecule
connected to each other by van der Waals forces is the second most
stable isomer. However, when we reoptimized the lowest energy structures
at the PBE0/6-311+G* level of theory, we found that the van der Waals
complex 1 is a global minimum and the planar hexagon-like
structure 2 is the second most stable isomer. At the
highest level of theory (CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pvQZ//PBE0/6-311+G*+ZPE/PBE0/6-311+G*
here and elsewhere) isomer 1 is more stable than 2 by about 5.1 kcal mol–1. The third isomer
of the N3P3 stoichiometry is a van der Waals
complex 3 between three diatomic molecules N2, NP, and P2, lying about 25.0 kcal mol–1 higher in energy. We found many local minima (LMs) similar to the
structures 1 and 3, which differ from them
by orientation of weakly bound molecules. The high symmetry hexagon-like
structure 2 is thermodynamically stable toward dissociation
into three diatomic molecules, but it is unstable toward dissociation
into NP3 + N2 complex. Other isomers were found
to be significantly higher in energy (see Supporting Information). Planar hexagonal-like structures of two CHP5 and C2H2P4 molecules were
previously shown15 to be the minima at
two density functional theory (DFT) methods (B3LYP/6-31G** and B3LYP/6-311++G**),
but to be the second order saddle points at the CCSD(T)/6-311++G**
level of theory. Therefore we re-optimized geometry of the hexagonal
structure of N3P3 at CCSD(T)/6-311+G* level
of theory We found that isomer 2 is a minimum at this
level of theory. Thus, we do not observe method dependence for planarity
of N3P3.

Figure 2 Representative optimized structures and
relative energies of the
lowest isomers of N3P3 (PBE0/6-311+G*+ZPE).
The order of the isomers is given according to relative energies at
PBE0/6-311+G*. Data on calculations performed by using CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pvQZ//PBE0/6-311+G*
are shown in brackets. In this figure and in Figures 3–5, phosphorus
atoms are green and nitrogen atoms are lilac. A more complete list
of isomers and their description are given in the Supporting Information (Figure S1).

Because of the thermodynamic instability of structure 2, we performed the search for the transition state (TS) between
structures 1 and 2. The computationally
found potential
energy surface profile is schematically shown in Figure 3. According to the calculations (DFT PBE0/6-311+G*+ZPE), on
the first stage of the reaction, the distortion of hexagon-like structure 2 (named A in Figure 3) occurs, which is caused by removing two
nitrogen atoms from the plane of the molecule. This process occurs
via the TS BTS with the barrier
of about 70 kcal mol–1. It is accompanied by transition
of the system into the local minimum C, which is less
stable than structure A by more than 50 kcal mol–1. Then, one of the above discussed nitrogen atoms
jumps over the adjacent phosphor atom (TS DTS), which leads to the formation of a weakly bound
complex of P3N plane and N2 molecule (structure E). Its dissociation via the TS FTS leads to the kinetically unstable van der Waals complex G, in which virtually barrier-free (HTS) relaxes into stable planar structure 3 (named I in Figure 3), representing the van der Waals complex between three
diatomic molecules N2, NP, and P2. The subsequent
approaching of P2 and PN molecules leads to the TS JTS, and the gradient descent along
the transition vector converts the reaction system into isomer K. In structure K, bond lengths of the tetra-atomic
fragment are equal to 2.153 Å (P–P) and 1.675 Å (P–N)
(see Figure S2). This process requires
overcoming the energy barrier of 30 kcal mol–1.
The final stage of the transition under study is associated with the
stabilization of the nitrogen atom in the vertex of NP3 pyramid. Transformation of structure K into global
minimum M (structure 1) occurs via TS LTS, which was found to be a singlet
biradical. Because the TS is an open-shell system, we performed single-point
calculations of the found isomers using the CAS(18,12)/6-311+G* method.
These calculations confirm that TSs LTS and JTS are open-shell
systems (the leading coefficient = 0.76). All other structures localized
by the DFT method were found to be good one-electron configuration
ones (the leading coefficient > 0.90). Thus, the transition from
structure 2 into the most thermodynamically stable structure 1 as well as dissociation of structure 2 into
van der
Waals complex 3 seems to be improbable in view of high-energy
barriers on the reaction path.

Figure 3 The mechanism of intramolecular rearrangements
of hexagon-like
structure 2 (A) into the most thermodynamically
stable structure 1 (M), according to the
DFT PBE0/6-311+G*+ZPE calculations. Data on single-point calculations
performed by using CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d) are shown in brackets. Here
and in Figure 4, all
energy values are estimated with respect to structure 1 (M).

We have also studied
the possibility of dissociation of the hexagon-like
structure 2 (A) into three isolated PN molecules
by analogy with the dissociation of benzene into three acetylene molecules.
On the first stage of the reaction as a result of removing opposite
nitrogen and phosphor atoms from the plane of the molecule, the system
takes the form of Dewar-like structure 4 (named O in Figure 4). This process requires overcoming the energy
barrier of 33.2 kcal mol–1. Therefore, cyclic isomer A (hexagon-like structure 2) is kinetically “protected”,
which allows us to conclude that it could be kinetically stable under
normal thermal conditions. Then, the rupture of P(terminal)–N(central)
bond occurs, and via TS PTS,
the system converts into structure Q. The latter represents
tetragon PNPN, one of the phosphor atoms of which is bound with the
NP fragment oriented over the PNPN plane at an angle of 114°.
This process as well as the previous one is endothermic. The subsequent
elongation of the second P(terminal)–N(central) bond is accompanied
by stabilization of the local minimum S. This process
requires overcoming the energy barrier of 50 kcal mol–1. Isomer S represents a planar structure in the form
of a fork, in which three PN molecules locate at distances allowing
the closest atoms of neighboring molecules to form P–N bonds
(1.700 Å), the subsequent elongation of which results in the
TS TTS (see Figure S3). This structure is less stable at 91.3 kcal mol–1 than the hexagon-like structure A. The
nitrogen atom of the central PN molecule deviates at 40° from
the plane formed by the other five atoms. Gradient descent along the
transition vector from the TS TTS leads to the formation of a van der Waals complex between three
isolated PN molecules U. Thus, the dissociation process
of initial isomer A into three PN molecules is endothermic,
and taking into account that the rearrangement of the A structure into three PN molecules requires overcoming 70–100
kcal mol–1 barriers, we think that our aromatic
structure A is stable.

Figure 4 Mechanism of dissociation of hexagon-like
structure 2 (A) into three PN molecules,
according to the PBE0/6-311+G*+ZPE
calculations. Data on single-point calculations performed by using
CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d) are shown in brackets.

The DFT calculations are in good agreement with the results
at
the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(d) level of theory. The predicted difference in
stabilization of van der Waals complexes I and U may be due to the correlation effects when we used the coupled
cluster method.

The aromaticity of the planar hexagonal structure 2 is confirmed by the following findings. First of all, the
high-symmetry
structure and bond equalization are good indicators of that. Second,
the N–P bond lengths in this structure—1.63 Å (PBE0/6-311+G*)
and 1.64 Å (CCSD(T)/6-311+G*)—are very close to half of
the double N=P bond in the HN=PH molecule: 1.58 Å
(PBE0/6-311+G*) and 1.60 Å (CCSD(T)/6-311+G*) and the single
N–P bond in the H2N–PH2 molecule:
1.71 Å (PBE0/6-311+G*) and 1.73 Å (CCSD(T)/6-311+G*). Next,
we calculated the popular magnetic test of aromaticity—NICSzz32,33 at the PBE0/6-311+G* level of theory for
both N3P3 and C6H6 molecules.
Results of our calculations are summarized in Table 1 (h is a height in the NICSzz calculations).

Table 1 NICSzz Index vs the Height
of the Molecule Plane for C6H6 and N3P3
 	NICSzz	
h (Å)	C6H6	N3P3	
0.0	–14.5	10.8	
0.2	–16.5	9.3	
0.4	–20.9	5.3	
0.6	–25.6	0.3	
0.8	–28.8	–4.2	
1.0	–29.7	–7.6	
1.2	–28.7	–9.6	
1.4	–26.4	–10.3	
1.6	–23.5	–10.2	
1.8	–20.5	–9.6	
2.0	–17.6	–8.8	
In spite of the positive values of NICSzz at h = 0, negative values of the NICSzz index between h = 0.8 and 2.0 Å clearly
indicate the deshielding
and π-aromaticity in N3P3. One can see
that benzene is more aromatic than our N3P3 molecule;
though according to this criterion, it has almost a half of benzene’s
aromaticity. The maximum of the negative values of NICSzz occurs at 1.4 Å in N3P3 compared to 1.0
Å in C6H6. This fact can be explained by
the larger atomic radius of phosphorus.

2.2 Aromatic
N3P3 Molecule
as a Ligand
Next, we computationally explore a possibility
of the planar hexagonal N3P3 molecule to be
a new ligand in chemistry. We selected the N3P3CrN3P3 molecule for this test because dibenzenechromium
C6H6CrC6H6 sandwich complex
is well-known in chemistry.34 Indeed we
found that the sandwich structure of the N3P3CrN3P3 molecule is the minimum (see Figure 5).

Figure 5 Optimized sandwich structure
of the N3P3CrN3P3 molecule.

There are very small distortions
from planarity of the N3P3 ring upon the formation
of this sandwich structure
(see Figure S4), but it looks like the
N3P3 ring is well-preserved. Therefore, we believe
that the aromatic N3P3 molecule could be a potential
new ligand in inorganic chemistry.

3 Conclusions
We computationally assessed the viability of the aromatic N3P3 molecule with a planar hexagonal structure.
According to the calculations, this isomer is slightly thermodynamically
unstable toward dissociation into a van der Waals complex between
NP3 distorted tetrahedron and N2 molecule but
is kinetically protected by high energy barriers of the nearest TSs,
which allows us to suggest its existence under normal thermal conditions.
The aromatic nature of the planar hexagonal structure is confirmed
by calculations of the magnetic index NICSzz and N–P
bond equalization. The calculations of the modeling of N3P3CrN3P3 sandwich complex indicate
a possibility of using the N3P3 molecule as
a potential ligand in chemistry.

4 Methods
First, we performed a machine search for the global minimum structure
for the N3P3 stoichiometry. The Coalescence-Kick
method35 for global minimum searches with
subsequent geometry optimization using the Gaussian 09 program36 was employed. Extensive searches (5000 trial
structures) for singlet configurations were conducted at the PBE037/3-21G38 level of
theory to explore the potential energy surface of the N3P3 stoichiometry. The low-lying isomers (ΔE ≤ 30 kcal mol–1) were recalculated
with geometry optimization and frequency calculations using a more
extended 6-311+G** basis set.39 Single-point
calculations were performed at three levels of coupled cluster method
(CCSD(T)40,41/6-311+G**, CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ,42 and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ) to determine a more
precise relative energy ordering. We also preformed PBE0/6-311+G*
calculations in the search for the dissociation path of the planar
hexagon structure into the lowest energy structure, which is a van
der Waals complex of N2 molecule and distorted tetrahedron
P3N. Single-point calculations for all TSs and LMs along
the dissociation path were recalculated at the CASSCF(18,12)43/6-311+G* and CCSD(T)/6-311+G* levels of theory
to ensure that the wave function was tested for the multiconfiguration
character. CASSCF(18,12) calculations include nine upper occupied
and three LUMOs. To confirm that the found TSs belong to the studied
reaction path, the method44 of steepest
descent (gradient motion) from the saddle point to the neighbor stationary
point (saddle or minimum) has been performed for all the TSs and intermediates.
