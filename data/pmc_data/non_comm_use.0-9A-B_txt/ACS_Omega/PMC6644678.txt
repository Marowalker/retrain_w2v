The
determination of biological thiols is considered to be of great
interest because of the participation of these molecules in physiological
disorders as indicators of their existence and progress, such as Alzheimer’s
disease, cancer, and cystic fibrosis, among others. Optical techniques
for the quantification of these analytes are superior to other techniques
in terms of selectivity, sensitivity, and cost. We describe here a
simple protocol to determine biological thiols by means of a colorimetric
analysis based on a magenta color interaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid). This methodology leverages the technology developed in smartphones,
and it can be transferred to a simple analytical procedure through
the use of absorbent strips and a cell phone. Excellent characteristics
were observed, and this method opens up alternative avenues for the
detection of biological thiols in a very simple and portable manner.

==== Body
Introduction
Thiols that are present
in living organisms include glutathione,
both reduced and oxidized (GSH and GSSG, respectively), cysteine (Cys),
and homocysteine (Hcy). These compounds participate in several physiological
processes and play vital roles in many biological systems.1−4 These low-molecular weight thiols are involved in the pathogenesis
of important disorders. For instance, Cys instils functions that include
detoxification, synthesis of proteins, metal binding, and metabolism,
and unusual levels of this essential amino acid could result in liver
damage, skin lesions, slow growth, depigmentation, or edema.5,6 GSH is the most abundant thiol in biological systems, and it acts
as an efficient defense against toxins and free radicals, thus protecting
cellular components from reactive oxygen species.7,8 Abnormal
levels of GSH could be due to a broad range of ailments because of
the intense oxidative conditions for cells, with heart problems and
cancer being two of the most common causes of demise.9

Given the importance of thiols from the biological,
clinical, and
environmental points of view, there is growing interest in the development
of novel analytical methodologies to quantify thiols. High-performance
liquid chromatography,10,11 gas chromatography,12,13 mass spectrometry,14−16 capillary electrophoresis,17,18 electrochemical methods,19,20 and nuclear magnetic
resonance spectroscopy21 are diverse techniques
used with the goal of detecting biological thiols. Nevertheless, these
methods suffer from certain drawbacks associated with the intrinsic
practical complexity, for example, high cost of the equipment and
maintenance, processing of results, potentially complex chemical derivatizations
required on the sample, and analysis time, which can be excessively
long in cases where time is a critical factor. These issues mean that
some of the aforementioned techniques are either inconvenient for
routine clinical self-analysis or analyses performed in field research
because the analysis system must be portable and low-cost and enable
rapid analysis times.

A promising alternative to the approaches
outlined above is the
development of chemical entities that are suitable for use as optical
sensors to detect and measure targeted biological thiols by colorimetric
and fluorometric spectroscopy. These analytical techniques have a
lower associated cost, shorter measurement times, easier operation,
and the instrument can be transported to areas in which the analyst
needs to carry out the determination rapidly. In recent years, a wide
variety of fluorogenic substrates, considering both the generation
of light with a specific wavelength after target detection and the
quenching of energy for the same interaction with the analyte, have
been presented and described in the scientific bibliography on the
detection of biological thiols.22−27

Given the widely reported utility of these fluorescent probes
to
quantify thiols, usually for tissue imaging in medicine, there has
been tendency to neglect the search for colorimetric, nonfluorometric
methodologies. However, the advantages of the aforementioned alternatives
are inherently associated with the simplicity of use, low cost, portability
of the equipment, and excellent sensitivity. Several decades ago,
Ellman described a simple and valid method for the measurement of
the sulfhydryl content in tissue by using 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic
acid) (DTNB).28 Tietze subsequently developed
Ellman’s work and identified an enzymatic method for the quantitative
determination of total and oxidized glutathione.29 This approach is currently considered the method of reference
to determine GSH and GSSG, with kits commercially available from numerous
chemical and pharmaceutical companies. Despite this situation, this
particular method for quantification has some disadvantages related
to the use of an enzymatic cycle (glutathione reductase is required
for the reduction of GSSG to GSH mediated by nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide phosphate, NADPH). This shows a gradual loss of activity
for the enzyme and consequently can have an adverse effect of the
accuracy of the method. Furthermore, the cost of this method is relatively
high, and it is therefore desirable to search for alternative methods
to overcome the drawbacks outlined above.

We report here a simple
nonenzymatic optical methodology to detect
and quantify thiols for common analysis in biological samples. The
method is based on a previously undescribed colorimetric response
by DTNB beyond the commonly used measurement at 412 nm due to the
release of the TNB– anion in Tietze’s approach.
In this new strategy, a chemical derivatization to mask GSH and remove
it from the total titration of thiols to quantify oxidized species
is not required. In this new method, the reduced thiols react in a
nonenzymatic manner with DTNB in a specific solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), to yield a previously unreported DTNB-mediated magenta coloration
in the solution. This color is suitable to be measured by any smartphone
application capable of identifying color space (in particular the
CMYK code).

Results and Discussion
The enzymatic cycle that is
commonly employed to assess the amount
of total thiols, both reduced and oxidized, is shown in Scheme 1. This procedure is not entirely
rigorous because GSH is considered to be the only thiol present in
biological tissues, which is not strictly the case. However, other
thiols such as Cys and Hcy are only present at low levels, and it
is widely accepted that total thiols (including Cys and Hcy) are currently
determined by the enzymatic cycle shown in Scheme 1. Nevertheless, when developing a method
to detect the presence of chemical compounds with the participation
of enzymes, there is a lack of reproducibility associated with the
clear variability of their catalytic activities depending on the ambient
preservation of these proteins.

Scheme 1 Conventional Spectrophotometric DTNB
Protocol to Determine Total
Biological Thiols Mediated by a Redox Enzymatic Cycle29
To design our experiments
for the alternative method, we questioned
why an efficient direct determination is not available for thiols
in the absence of enzyme and utilizing the minimum number of chemical
components in the cuvette (analyte + sensor + solvent). It was decided
to evaluate the route in the cycle at the bottom of Scheme 1. The choice of solvent was
made to achieve complete solubility of both GSH and DTNB. As a consequence,
deionized water, chloroform, ethanol, and DMSO were tested because
of their appropriate polarities for oligopeptides. However, only the
last solvent was capable of dissolving GSH and DTNB completely and
separately.

Unexpectedly, on adding to a vial the combination
of DMSO as solvent,
DTNB as the eventual oxidant, and GSH as the analyte to be evaluated,
a different behavior was observed to that represented in Scheme 1 (i.e., a yellow
color visible to the naked eye). In our case, the behavior after combination
was characterized by an attractive red color (Figure 1a). None of the other solvents tested produced
a similar effect, including the previously demonstrated cleavage of
DTNB to yield yellow TNB– in the presence of GSH.
The selectivity of the detection was evaluated by testing other biological
thiols and amino acids, such as GSSG (pure, without free thiol), Cys,
Hcy, glycine (Gly), alanine (Ala), arginine (Arg), and proline (Pro).
A colorimetric response was not observed for GSSG, but the addition
of a biological reducing agent, that is, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
(NADH), which is significantly cheaper than NADPH, led to the appearance
of an intense color. The reducing conditions clearly promoted cleavage
of the disulfur bond and the subsequent interaction with DTNB/DMSO
in a similar way to that observed with the GSH sample (Figure 1a,b). On investigating other
thiols, it was found that Cys also gave a marked response. Both GSH
and Cys gave rise to a maximum absorbance at 499 nm (Figure 1c). GSSG gave a peak at 484
nm after reduction. The remaining amino acids did not give rise to
optical responses between 450 and 500 nm. GSSG itself did not exhibit
signals at these wavelengths, as one would expect given the presence
of the disulfur functional group.

analyzed, considering GSH, GSSG, and GSSG after reduction with NADH,
Cys, and Hcy, and other amino acids with potential interferences,
such as Gly, Ala, Arg, and Pro. All samples were first prepared with
distilled water at a concentration of 40 mM, and they were then diluted
to 10 mM in DMSO. Front view of samples (a) and top view (b). (c)

Error bars (mainly negligible) represent standard deviation (n = 3).

The different analytes
shown in Figure 1a
were evaluated at several concentrations
to develop the corresponding features of the sensing methodology.
The colorimetric response of the system DMSO/DTNB was studied in the
presence of the analytes. Measurements were made at room temperature,
and the wavelength was established at 499 nm. Moreover, the spectrophotometer
worked under the “timecourse” operating mode and therefore
did not register any isolated absorbance. This was applied as a result
of the increase of the optical signal with time (Figure S1 in the Supporting Information). Thus, the values represented
in Figure 1d correspond
to the maximum difference in the absorbance between the blank and
the top value registered for each concentration. It can be seen from
Figures S1 to S9 (Supporting Information) that the curves fit parabolic, linear, or decreasing behaviors,
depending on the nature of the analyte. For thiols that were capable
of giving a response, namely, GSH, GSSG, and Cys, the corresponding
detection limits (LODs) were calculated to measure the smallest concentration
that could be determined with a specified precision, working as a
function of both sensitivity and signal stability.30 The LOD values were as follows: LODGSH = 15.6
× 10–9 M; LODGSSG = 41.6 ×
10–9 M; LODCys = 36.4 × 10–9 M, improving sensitivities associated with other remarkable works
based on fluorescence.31

This strategy
avoids the inconvenience of derivatization of GSH
where the GSSG/GSH ratio must be calculated by colorimetric techniques
(e.g., Ellman’s reagent in Scheme 1). In essence, the global amount of total
oxidized and reduced thiols is determined and GSH is conveniently
derivatized and thus removed from the probe, with only the GSSG present
in the sample being measured by enzymatic methods. In contrast, on
applying our methodology, one can initially determine the GSH concentration
at 499 nm and then apply reducing conditions and determine the growth
of the absorbance at 484 nm, as shown in Figure 1c.

This new strategy was evaluated
by preparing a range of mixtures
of GSH and GSSG with the aim of checking the direct titration at 499
and 484 nm, respectively. Probes that contained a constant concentration
for GSH and variable GSSG concentrations were analyzed optically,
and the data are plotted in Figure 2a. First, GSH was determined at 499 nm in the presence
of DMSO and DTNB. The sample was then treated with NADH to reduce
GSSG, and the measurements were then made at 484 nm. As one would
expect, the GSH values remained practically unchanged on account of
the fixed concentration at 5.5 μM. The reductive effect of NADH
on GSSG led to an increase in the absorbance (the graph is provided
in the Supporting Information, Figure S11).
NADH did not show an absorbance at 499 or 484 nm (Supporting Information, Figure S12) and therefore did not
interfere in the thiol determination. Tests incorporating other antioxidants
and reducing agents of the common presence in biological samples,
such as N-acetylcysteine, ascorbic acid, and glucose,
were conducted, and no optical effects on GSSG determination were
noted by means of the application of our methodology. This easy sequential
determination of GSH and GSSG is a promising alternative method that
does not require chemical derivatization of GSH to remove it from
the system, a drawback that is inherent in contemporary procedures.32

Figure 2 (a) Responses of several mixtures of GSH and GSSG in the
presence
of NADH in a reductant role. Measurements were made at two different
wavelengths depending on the thiols. Each system contains DTNB 1.4
mM in DMSO. (b) 1H NMR shifts depend on the variable GSH
concentration in the system. (c) GSH concentration in human sera estimated
by the standard addition procedure. Error bars for (a,c) represent
standard deviation (n = 3).

It seems clear that an interaction occurs between the components
in the mixture. Magnetic resonance measurements were performed to
identify the functional groups that participate in the generation
of the magenta color (Figure 2b). DTNB signals showed a pronounced variation as the concentration
of GSH increased, with an attenuation and shift of sensor signals
observed until they vanished completely as the signals due to the
thiol increased in intensity in proportion to its concentration.

Next, we applied this methodology to determine the GSH concentration
present in a real human serum commercially purchased. We used a standard
addition procedure considering different GSH concentrations (Supporting Information, Figure S13). The average
GSH concentration in the serum was determined considering absorbance
differences (Figure 2c) and found to be 1.035 ± 0.025 μM (n = 3). The average percent recovery of our method (defined as ([GSHestimated]/[GSHtheoretical]) × 100) was determined
in 95%. The consequent comparison to the reference methodology33 was achieved to validate our determination,
depicting similar concentrations.

The portability of any method
for chemical analysis is a key aspect
in terms of development and potential applicability, such that it
can be implemented in field studies away from the laboratory or in
any situation without the need for cumbersome equipment usually used
in laboratories. Finally, the cost associated with the analysis is
an important aspect, and this must be minimized by controlling the
investment in laboratory equipment. An interesting option in this
respect is to harness the adaptability of smartphones, which are now
ubiquitous in our society. The recent development of smartphones and
their impressive technological applications open a staggering variety
of options in numerous areas. User-friendly smartphone analytical
methods are continuing to emerge, and some examples have already been
described in the bibliography for pH measurement34 or anion detection,35 thus confirming
a contemporary development associated with more advanced algorithms
for smartphones. In terms of colorimetry, a broad range of software
applications, commonly called apps, are available for users for various
platforms, such as Android, iOS, BlackBerry OS, or Windows Phone.
In the work described here, the recently distributed free app Hex
Color Detector version 0.0.2, developed by Senseify for Android 5.0
Lollipop, was employed as a surprisingly accurate color identifier
by means of alphanumerical codes. More specifically, the CMYK encryption
proved to be the most appropriate for our purposes, where cyan, magenta,
yellow, and black (key color) are the components of any tonality in
the color range. Only the magenta percentage was considered owing
to its predominance over the others.

The procedure was utilized
to determine the presence of GSH in
a number of samples. Tests on different concentrations of GSH (0–1000
μM) were carried out in glass vials along with aluminium strips
that had an area of 0.5 cm × 0.5 cm with permeable silica (Figure 3a). The strips were
immersed in GSH solutions in an appropriate position for 2 min until
complete permeation of the silica zone with GSH solution had been
achieved (Figure 3b).
The strips were immediately taken out of the vials and treated with
several drops of DTNB solution (0.1 mM) on the active surface (Figure 3c). The color changed
immediately (Figure 3d), and after 1 min, the active zones for quantification generated
a gradient in magenta tonality depending on the concentration. Data
registration was performed by focusing on up to 10 different points
within the active zone for each strip to guarantee a suitable statistical
data translation (Figure 3e and Table S1 in the Supporting Information). Finally, the resultant graph demonstrates the surprising capacity
of this simple methodology to register a large accumulation of data
and achieve excellent capacities in conjunction with great accuracy,
simplicity, speed, and low cost (Figure 3f). The exponential behavior includes a linear
region with an upper limit of around 80 μM GSH. The LOD was
determined to be 11.4 × 10–6 M.

The exponential fit resulted in the equation y =
41.459(1 – e–0.005x) with R2 = 0.995. Meanwhile, the linear range was adjusted
to the equation y = −2.126 + 0.221x with R2 = 0.993. Error bars
represent standard deviation (n = 10).

Conclusions
In summary, we have
developed an innovative way to determine thiols
such as GSH, Cys, and the oxidized species GSSG. The approach is based
on an unprecedented colorimetric interaction, which has not previously
been reported in the literature, between thiols and DTNB in the presence
of DMSO, and this change is suitable for evaluation at a specific
wavelength. Excellent characteristics were identified in terms of
selectivity and sensitivity in the presence of other biological molecules
or in real samples, and this method is useful for the direct quantification
of GSH/GSSG ratios without the need for chemical modifications. This
strategy has been successfully extrapolated to allow the portable
analysis of thiols using the camera included in a smartphone and a
suitable app for color detection. Good results were obtained, and
this opens new doors for the use of smartphone technology for the
titration of a wider variety of analytes.

Experimental Section
Materials
Commercially available materials were used
without further purification. DTNB, DMSO, l-cysteine (Cys), dl-homocysteine (Hcy), glycine (Gly), l-alanine (Ala), dl-arginine (Arg), l-proline (Pro), ascorbic acid,
and human sera were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. NADH was purchased
from Roche. l-Glutathione reduced (GSH) and l-glutathione
oxidized (GSSG) were obtained from Acros Organics. Silica strips were
prepared manually from silica gel 60 with 0.20 mm of thickness placed
on aluminum sheets (20 cm × 20 cm) for thin-layer chromatography.
These silica sheets were purchased from Macherey-Nagel. Deionized
water, chloroform, and ethanol were supplied by Scharlab.

Methodology
All experiments were conducted at room
temperature (between 20 and 25 °C). Optical experiments were
performed on a Shimadzu 1603 UV–vis spectrophotometer and quartz
cuvettes with 1 cm of width and 3 mL of volume. Two registration modes
were utilized for spectrophotometry. First, a scanning mode served
to identify the wavelengths of interest for subsequent experiments
(Figure 1c). Second,
experiments were carried out using the time-course mode of the spectrophotometer
to control the evolution of absorbance in relation to time and resulting
absorbance variations (Figures 1d and S1–S9). The app for
color detection was Hex Color Detector, version 0.0.2, from Senseify,
available for Android 5.0 Lollipop and installed on an LG G2 D620
smartphone. The 1H NMR spectrum was recorded on a Bruker
400 MHz spectrometer at 20 °C. All 1H NMR spectra
are reported in parts per million (ppm) downfield of TMS and were
measured relative to the signals for CHCl3 (7.26 ppm).
Statistical and graphics treatments were carried out using SigmaPlot
12 software by Systat (USA).

Identification of Optical Activity and Interrogation
of Different
Samples (Thiols and Nonthiols)
Diverse chemical analytes
were interrogated in the spectrophotometer to investigate the maximum
absorbance and sufficient selectivity in our procedure. Therefore,
probes with GSH, GSSG, Cys, Arg, Gly, Ala, Hcy, and Pro were initially
prepared using distilled water. The concentration in this stage for
the stock solution corresponded to 40 mM. The next step involved diluting
these solutions to 10 mM in different solvents: distilled water, ethanol,
chloroform, or DMSO. With the exception of DMSO as solvent, none of
the other options allowed for the complete solution of thiols and
amino acids, thus making DMSO the solvent of choice. On applying these
conditions, solutions showed evident coloration (Figure 1a,b), and optical profiles
for samples were registered from 300 to 700 nm, with peak maxima at
484 nm for GSSG reduced by NADH, while GSH and Cys presented intense
peaks at 499 nm (Figure 1c). Arg gave a moderate peak at 403 nm, but this did not interfere
with the measurements.

Visualization of Optical Responses for Different
Analytes and
Determination of the LOD
Several aliquots of analytes (GSH,
GSSG, Cys, Arg, Gly, Ala, Hcy, and Pro) were prepared at the following
concentrations (μM) in cuvettes: 0.0, 0.1, 0.4, 1.0, 1.9, 3.0,
3.5, 5.0, and 5.5. In addition, the cuvette included DTNB 1.4 mM as
a sensor reagent and DMSO as the solvent until the cuvette was full.
Optical measurements were taken using the timecourse method in the
spectrophotometer, given that the absorbance presented a parabolic
profile that gave a maximum and then diminished. The graphics are
included in this Supporting Information in the following order: Figure S1 for GSH, Figure S2 for GSSG, Figure
S3 for GSSG treated with NADH, Figure S4 for Cys, Figure S5 for Hcy,
Figure S6 for Ala, Figure S7 for Gly, Figure S8 for Pro, and Figure
S9 for Arg. Differences in absorbance between the maximum value and
the blank value were taken into consideration to generate Figure 1d after 3 assays
for each concentration. Statistical fits gave the following equations
from a linear regression                

The LOD was calculated as following  where n is the number
of
values or repetitions obtained for each concentration, and SD0 corresponds to the standard deviation of the lower concentration
capable of being measured through a significant variation of the signal.

Sequential Determination of GSSG/GSH Mixtures without Chemical
Derivatization
Some aliquots containing GSH and different
concentrations of GSSG were prepared. For GSH, a concentration fixed
at 5.5 μM was established for all samples. However, the GSSG
was included according to a gradual growth, namely, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0,
2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 μM. These reagents were examined by visible
spectrophotometry in cuvettes, also as mixtures with DTNB (1.4 mM)
and DMSO as solvent. The timecourse method in the detector was set
up at 499 nm. The signal increases because of the existence of GSH
until stabilization or a decrease (about 10 min). At this point, 2
mg of NADH powder was added to the cuvette, and the wavelength was
changed to 484 nm. The signal then continued to increase before stabilizing
again. A range of behaviors for the considered different aliquots
are represented in Figure S11, and the
evolution caused by consecutive increases in GSSG concentration is
shown in Figure 2a.

Determination of GSH in Commercial Sera Human
Powder
sera human (1 mg) was solubilized in 0.5 mL of deionized water and
9.5 mL of DMSO and then homogenized. Separately, stock solutions of
DTNB and GSH in DMSO were prepared. Finally, for each cuvette, 1.4
mM of DTNB and different concentrations of GSH (0.0, 0.1, 0.7, 1.9,
and 3.5 μM) in cuvette were prepared in sera human solution
as solvent. The difference between maximum absorbance and the value
in the absence of sera human was registered under the timecourse function
of the spectrophotometer (Figure S13).

Determination of Thiols by Means of a Smartphone Color App
GSH solutions (0.0, 10.0, 20.0, 40.0, 60.0, 80.0, 150.0, 250.0,
400.0, 700.0, and 1000.0 μM) in DMSO were prepared in vials
along with handmade aluminum strips with an absorbent silica zone
at the edge (Figure 3a). Each strip was immersed in the corresponding vial until complete
permeation (Figure 3b). Immediately after, 50 μL DTNB 0.1 mM in DMSO was deposited
in succession on each wet area (Figure 3c) and coloration appeared (Figure 3d). A photo was taken of each strip, and
this was opened with the smartphone app (Figure 3e). In this work, ten different points were
selected to identify the magenta index in the CMYK color code, but
more points could be examined if required. To conclude, the magenta
index was found to be dependent on concentration (Figure 3f) with five assays required
for this determination.
