Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)
known as a persistent organic
pollutant has been attracting great interests due to its potential
ecotoxicity. An approach capable of sensing ultra-trace PFOS is in
urgent demand. Here, we developed an approach for highly sensitive
sensing PFOS using surfactant-sensitized covalent organic frameworks
(COFs)-functionalized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) as a fluorescent
probe. COFs-functionalized UCNPs (UCNPs@COFs) were obtained by solvothermal
growth of 1,3,5-triformylbenzene and 1,4-phenylenediamine on the surface
of UCNPs. COF’s layer on the surface of UCNPs not only provides
recognition sites for PFOS but also improves the fluorescence quantum
yields from 2.15 to 5.12%. Trace PFOS can quench the fluorescence
emission of UCNPs@COFs at 550 nm due to the high electronegativity
of PFOS. Moreover, the fluorescence quenching response can be significantly
strengthened in the presence of a surfactant, which causes more sensitivity.
The fluorescence quenching degrees (F0 – F) of the system are linear with the concentration
of PFOS in the range of 1.8 × 10–13 to 1.8
× 10–8 M. The present sensor can sensitively
and selectively detect PFOS in tap water and food packing with the
limit of detection down to 0.15 pM (signal-to-noise ratio = 3), which
is comparable to that of the liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry
technique. The proposed approach realized a simple, fast, sensitive,
and selective sensing PFOS, showing potential applications in various
fields.

Introduction
Perfluorooctane sulfonate
(PFOS) is an important chemical, which
has been extensively used to make various products such as textiles,
lubricants, clothes, cosmetics, carpet, waterproof agents, and firefighting
foams due to its hydrophobic and oleophobic nature.1,2 PFOS
is also well known as a typical persistent organic pollutant due to
its persistence, bioaccumulation, high toxicity, and difficult degradation
in the environment on account of the stability of the carbon–fluorine
bond in fluorocarbons.3 As a widespread
contaminant, the existence of PFOS in our surroundings has been widely
reported.4 Toxicological studies have demonstrated
that the presence of PFOS even in trace amounts might induce serious
functional damages to the human liver and kidneys and adverse effects
on the fatty acid metabolism, the reproductive system, and hormones
secretion system.2,5,6 It
is imperative to develop highly sensitive analytical methods for investigating
the spread and potential quantity of PFOS in the environment. In the
past years, major detection methods available for PFOS were mainly
based on liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)
and liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry
(LC–MS/MS).7−9 These techniques have demonstrated high sensitivity;
however, complicated and expensive equipment, expert operators, and
time-consuming sample preparation have limited their wide application
in real-time monitoring. Thus, various sensing techniques such as
electrochemical,10 photoelectrochemical,11 and fluorescence1,12−15 have also been used to detect PFOS. Nevertheless, these methods
still have some disadvantages, such as lack of electrochemical activity,16,17 lower sensitivity, and serious background interference. Based on
these facts, a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for the detection
of PFOS is highly desirable for environmental monitoring.

Over
the past decades, upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), especially
lanthanide-doped nanocrystals, have attracted wide attention due to
their prominent property that converts low-energy light (near-infrared)
into a higher-energy light (UV–vis) via a two-photon or multiphoton
mechanism.18 Compared with traditional
fluorophores, UCNPs possess unique properties such as a weak autofluorescence
background, high photochemical stability, high resistance to photobleaching,
large Stokes shifts, sharp emission bands, and high fluorescence quantum
yield.19−21 These unique properties make them ideal sensing materials
for sensing trace targets in chemical and biochemical analysis.22−24 Furthermore, the integration of UCNPs with other functional nanostructures
could construct the various nanocomposites with highly enriched functionalities,25 which possess a great utilitarian value for
highly sensitive sensors. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), as an
emerging class of crystalline porous polymer materials covalently
connected by organic building blocks containing light elements (typically
C, H, N, B, O),26,27 have received exponential attention
due to their remarkable properties such as low density, periodic porosity,
high surface area, and high thermal and chemical stability.28−30 COFs have shown great potential applications in many research fields,
such as gas storage and adsorption, chemical sensors, and drug delivery.31−33 In addition, COFs have been considered as ideal candidates for fluorescence
sensors due to their conjugated structure. However, up to now, little
attention has been devoted to construct the fluorescence sensor based
on the combination of COFs with UCNPs.

Here, we proposed a highly
sensitive fluorescence approach for
sensing ultra-trace PFOS based on a novel fluorescent probe integrating
the advantages of UCNPs and COFs. Such a fluorescent probe was synthesized
via the solvothermal growth of COFs on the surface of UCNPs (denoted
as UCNPs@COFs). UCNPs were prepared by the solvothermal method with
uniform size and shape and then modified by tetraethyl orthosilicate
(TEOS) and 3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane (APS) to generate amine groups-functionalized
UCNPs (denoted as UCNPs@NH2). Meanwhile, highly stable
porous COFs were synthesized by the condensation reaction between
1,3,5-triformylbenzene (TFB) and p-phenylenediamine (PDA) on the surface
of UCNPs@NH2 (Scheme 1a). Importantly, the fluorescence response of UCNPs@COFs
was highly sensitive to PFOS, and the fluorescence quenching occurred
in the presence of different concentrations of PFOS (Scheme 1b). Besides, the surfactant
could further sensitize the fluorescence quenching. With the sensing
system, the amount of PFOS spiked in tap water and food packing was
successfully analyzed.

and Discussion
Synthesis and Characterization of UCNPs@COFs
UCNPs
with uniform size and shape distribution are highly attractive label
groups.34 COF-LZU1 is a typical imine-based
COF prepared by the condensation reaction between TFB and PDA.35 Here, we integrate the advantages of UCNPs and
COF-LZU1 to fabricate the core–shell UCNPs@COFs. It is worth
mentioning that besides the selective enrichment of PFOS, COF material
on the surface of UCNPs also enhances dramatically the fluorescence
quantum yield from 2.15 to 5.12%. The reason for the enhanced fluorescence
quantum of UCNPs after being functionalized with COFs can be explained
from two aspects. First, the surface characteristics of UCNPs are
important for the fluorescence efficiency of UCNPs, as they expose
numerous lanthanide dopants to surface deactivations caused by surface
defects.36 Therefore, the upconversion
efficiency can be improved by adjusting the surface surroundings of
lanthanide UCNPs, such as the formation of core–shell structures
or the combination with other materials.37 Besides, COFs usually contain large π-conjugated building
units because of the inherent rigid structure. Therefore, COFs were
mainly synthesized through the reactions of aromatic building blocks.
Especially, the formation of −C=N– bonds could
further enhance the π-conjugated system and the resulting materials
have a stronger fluorescent intensity.38,39 The resulting
fluorescent nanoparticle was employed as a fluorescent probe for sensing
PFOS (Scheme 1). In
the first step, UCNPs were synthesized by the solvothermal method,
and the transmission electron microscope (TEM) image showed that the
particle size of the hexagonal-phase UCNPs crystals was about 20–30
nm (Figure 1a). In
the second step, the resulting UCNPs were further modified with APS
by the reverse microemulsion method to obtain amino-functionalized
UCNPs (UCNPs@NH2). As shown in Figure 1b, a layer material of amine groups has been
successfully coated onto the surface of UCNPs, and the radius of the
spherical particle was approximately 60 nm. In the final step, the
nucleation seed material was synthesized by coating a thin layer of
Schiff base polymer on the surface of UCNPs@NH2. As a special
monomer, UCNPs@NH2 with amino groups could react with the
aldehyde groups of TFB and significantly improve the compatibility
of UCNPs and COFs. Then, TFB and PDA were added to synthesize COFs
on the surface of the seed particles. TEM images revealed core–shell
structures of the resulting UCNPs@COFs, and the thickness of the COFs
layer was about 5 nm (Figure 1c). In addition, the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image
(Figure S1) also showed that the resultant
was spherical and a fluffy porous structure was clearly observed.

(green), UCNPs (pink), UCNPs@NH2 (blue), COFs (red), and
UCNPs@COFs (black). (f) Thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) patterns of
UCNPs (black) and UCNPs@COFs (red).

The corresponding structures of the resulting material in different
steps were confirmed by FT-IR (Figure 1d). The characteristic peaks of the asymmetric and
symmetrical stretching vibration of C=O groups of oleic acid
(OA) were visible at 1421 and 1560 cm–1, respectively,
and the peaks at 2929 and 2855 cm–1 were assigned
to the stretching vibration of the methylene and ethylene groups of
OA, respectively. For the FT-IR spectra of UCNPs@NH2, the
peaks at 1047 and 3436 cm–1 were attributed to the
stretching vibration of Si–O–Si and N–H, respectively.
The vibration bands at around 1617 cm–1 in the FT-IR
spectrum of UCNPs@COFs were visibly observed, which was evident for
the formation of the C=N bond. By comparing the FT-IR spectrum
of UCNPs@COFs with those of the corresponding monomers, the reduced
peak intensities corresponding to aldehyde (1697 cm–1) and amino (3374 cm–1) bands were associated with
the residual aldehyde and amino groups at the edges of the COFs, respectively
(Figure S2).

To further validated
the resulting material, the crystal structures
were analyzed by PXRD. As shown in Figure 1e, the shape and position of UCNPs diffracted
peaks were consistently matched with the standard alignment card (JCPDS
standard card number 16-0334). There were no significant changes in
the PXRD curve of UCNPs@NH2 via the amino-functionalized
process, and the curve of UCNPs@COFs contained major peaks and crystallinity
of COFs, which could indicate that COFs have been successfully grafted
on the surface of the UCNPs@NH2 via the Schiff base reaction.

The thermal stabilities of UCNPs and UCNPs@COFs were evaluated
by TGA. The curves of UCNPs and UCNPs@COFs are all shown in Figure 1f. The mass loss
was observed in the range from 200 to 800 °C, which could result
from the decomposition of the organic coating of COFs. In addition,
the evaporation of the adsorbed moisture also caused mass loss below
200 °C (Figure 1f). The mass loss in the range of 200–800 °C followed
the sequence of UCNPs (10.5%) < UCNPs@COFs (43.6%), which indicated
the successful bonding of COFs on the surface of UCNPs.

Fluorescence
Response of UCNPs@COFs to PFOS
Fluorophore,
the solvent, and the analyte are three major factors of fluorescence
sensing. The interference of the Raman scattering signal of the solvent
can be eliminated due to the inherent nature of the present upconversion
fluorescence material. Here, the fluorescence emissions of UCNPs@COFs
dispersed in different solvents were first investigated, where four
organic solvents (ethanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetonitrile,
and dichloromethane (DCM)) commonly used in laboratories and water
were chosen. The results displayed that the fluorescence emission
intensity of UCNPs@COFs dispersed in different solvents had a marked
difference. The resulting material dispersed in DMF exhibited the
strongest fluorescence emission at 550 nm among the investigated solvents
(Figure S3). The fluorescence emission
intensities of UCNPs@COFs dispersed in different organic solvents
decreased in the order of DMF, acetonitrile, ethanol, and DCM. The
weakest fluorescence emission was observed in the case of UCNPs@COFs
dispersed in water and is the reason we inferred was that the polarity
of the organic solvent mainly led to the difference in the fluorescence
intensity. The polarity of these organic solvents decreased in the
order of DMF > acetonitrile > ethanol > DCM. In addition,
the weakest
fluorescence emission of UCNPs@COFs dispersed in water might be attributed
to the strong polarity of water to form the hydrogen bond between
water and the imine of the material, and the poor dispersion in water
was caused by the hydrophobic nature of UCNPs@COFs. Thus, the subsequent
experiments were conducted in the DMF medium.

Besides the effect
of the solvent on the fluorescence intensity, the stability and the
amount of the resulting fluorescence material added have been also
evaluated. The fluorescence emission intensities were almost constant
as the initial level after storage for 90 days in DMF (Figure S4), which illustrated the excellent stability
of UCNPs@COFs. In addition, the fluorescence response of the resulting
material to PFOS was examined by mixing different concentrations (0.07,
0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.11, and 0.12 mg·mL–1) of
UCNPs@COF solution with a fixed concentration of the PFOS solution.
From these results, we found that when the concentration of the resulting
fluorescence material was 0.10 mg·mL–1, the
maximum difference F0 – F (here, F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities of UCNPs@COFs without and with
PFOS, respectively) was obtained (Figure 2a). Thus, we could conclude that the fluorescence
emission of UCNPs@COFs was quenched by PFOS, and the quenching degree
was dependent on the concentrations of UCNPs@COFs. So, we chose 0.10
mg·mL–1 UCNPs@COFs for further experiments.

of different surfactants on fluorescence quenching. (d) Effect of
the concentration of SDBS on fluorescence quenching (F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities
of UCNPs@COFs at 550 nm in the absence and presence of PFOS, respectively).

Effect of the Reaction Time on Fluorescence
Quenching
Reaction time is a significant factor in the sensing
system. Here,
the effect of the reaction time on the fluorescence quenching efficiency
of UCNPs@COFs has been checked by keeping the concentration of UCNPs@COFs
(0.10 mg·mL–1) and PFOS (1.8 × 10–4 M) constant. The results revealed that fluorescence
quenching immediately occurred, and the quenching efficiency was increased
by increasing the reaction time to 10 min and then decreased with
the increase in the reaction time (Figure 2b). Thus, the reaction time was set at 10
min for the following experiments.

Effect of the Surfactant
on Fluorescence Quenching
Surfactants have been well known
as dispersing agents and surface
modifiers.40 To acquire a preferable fluorescence
quenching efficiency, we inspected whether the addition of a surfactant
to the sensing system could improve the fluorescence response of UCNPs@COFs
to PFOS. Here, three kinds of surfactants, including two anion surfactants
(sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate
(SDBS)), two cationic surfactants (hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide
(CTAB) and cetylpyridine bromide (CPB)), and one neutral surfactant
(3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio] propanesulfonate; CHAPS),
were employed. The fluorescence response of UCNPs@COFs to PFOS was
checked in the presence of each surfactant. As shown in Figure 2c, the surfactant markedly
affected the fluorescence quenching of UCNPs@COFs caused by PFOS.
Compared with the results obtained in the absence of any surfactant,
SDS, SDBS, and CHAPS could enhance fluorescence quenching; however,
CTAB and CPB caused an inverse effect (Figure S5). The strongest quenching response of the material caused
by PFOS was observed in the presence of SDBS. We speculated that the
surfactant changed the surface property of UCNPs@COFs due to their
interaction. CTAB and CPB carried a positive charge and both could
induce a charge transfer from UCNPs@COFs to surfactants, which caused
fluorescence quenching in the absence of PFOS. However, anion and
neutral surfactants improved the fluorescence intensity of the material
due to a negative charge or neutral nature. To verify the change in
the surface property, UCNPs@COFs were separated from the solutions
containing SDBS, CHAPS, or CPB, respectively, and their contact angles
were analyzed. The results revealed that the contact angle increased
from 80.60° for initial UCNPs@COFs to 115.89° for SDBS-treated
UNCPs@COFs and 95.93° for CPB-treated UNCPs@COFs (Figure S6). After being treated with CHAPS, UNCPs@COFs
exhibited a smaller contact angle (61.90°) due to the neutral
nature.

According to the above results, the effect of the concentration
of SDBS on the sensing sensitivity was further demonstrated by investigating
the fluorescence quenching of UCNPs@COFs caused by the same concentration
of PFOS in the presence of different concentrations of SDBS. From
the results (Figure 2d), we found that the fluorescence intensity difference F0 – F reached the maximum when
the concentration of SDBS was 5 mM. To improve the fluorescence response
of UCNPs@COFs to PFOS, 5 mM of SDBS was added to the sensing system
in the subsequent experiments.

Quenching Mechanism
Our experimental results indicated
that the fluorescence emission intensity of UCNPs@COFs greatly decreased
at 550 nm in the presence of PFOS at an excitation wavelength of 980
nm. The aperture size of COFs is ∼1.8 nm as estimated from
the crystallographic data.41 Molecules
with sizes below 1.2 nm could easily enter the ordered pores of UCNPs@COFs.35 Thus, one reasonable explanation of the quenching
mechanism was that the layer of COFs on the surface of UCNPs@COFs
could enrich more PFOS, which could lead to fluorescence quenching,
due to the sulfonate groups and the perfluoroalkyl chain of PFOS,
as they can combine with the amino groups and hydrogens on the benzene
ring of the COFs through hydrogen bond or electrostatic interactions.1,12 Besides, the sensitized fluorescence quenching effect might be attributed
to the SDBS adsorbed on the pores of UCNPs@COFs, which could induce
more PFOS to enter the pores due to the hydrogen bonding interaction
between perfluoroalkyl and dodecyl groups.14,42 In addition, collisional quenching of fluorescence can be described
by the Stern–Volmer equation, and the plots of F0/F vs the concentration of the quencher
are expected to be linear. Herein, linear Stern–Volmer plots
and the absence of fluorescence spectra shifts suggested that the
fluorescence quenching might be a dynamic process (Figure S7). Static and dynamic quenching can also be distinguished
by their differing dependence on temperature, viscosity, or lifetime
measurements. Higher temperatures result in faster diffusion and hence
larger amounts of collisional quenching. According to our experimental
results, the change in the slope of the Stern–Volmer plots
with the increasing temperature confirmed our speculation effectively
(Figure S7).

Sensitivity and Selectivity
of the Sensor
As proof
of the proposed strategy, fluorescence quenching of UCNPs@COFs was
measured upon the addition of different concentrations of the PFOS
solution. When the PFOS concentration was changed in the range of
1.8 × 10–13–1.8 × 10–8 M, the fluorescent intensity changes in UCNPs@COFs were collected
(Figure 3a). We could
observe that the fluorescence emission of UCNPs@COFs was quenched
with the increase in the concentration of PFOS. It is worthy to note
that trace PFOS even at a low concentration of 0.18 pM could cause
fluorescence quenching, illustrating that UCNPs@COFs was ultrasensitive
to trace PFOS. Plots of F0 – F vs log[PFOS] demonstrated a good linear correlation over
the concentration range from 1.8 × 10–13 to
1.8 × 10–8 M for PFOS (R2 = 0.99959, Figure 3b). The limit of detection for PFOS, at a signal-to-noise
ratio of 3, is 0.15 pM, which is far lower than the most recent United
States Environmental Protection Agency Provisional Health Advisory
values (1.3 × 10–10 M of PFOS for drinking
water).43 Moreover, the result is compared
to that obtained by LC–MS and is lowest among the reported
results by other sensors (Table 1).

DMF) to different amounts of PFOS. (b) Plot of F0 – F vs log[PFOS] (F0 and F are the fluorescence intensities

To verify the selectivity of the present sensor, the fluorescence
response of UCNPs@COFs to six structural analogues of PFOS was also
evaluated. As shown in Figure 4, the results showed that PFOS induced the strongest fluorescence
quenching (F0 – F), although the same concentration (1.8 × 10–8 M) was adopted for these compounds. Thus, UCNPs@COFs were highly
selective toward PFOS over the other six perfluorinated compounds.
We speculated that both the perfluorinated carbon chain and sulfonic
acid groups synergistically caused the fluorescence quenching of UCNPs@COFs
in the presence of SDBS. Thus, the fluorescence quenching degree was
enhanced with the increase in the carbon chain of these compounds
(perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA),
perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and
perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA)) containing carboxyl groups. Furthermore,
the apparent difference of fluorescence quenching between perfluorohexanesulfonic
acid potassium (PFHxS) and PFHxA suggested that sulfonic acid played
an important role in quenching. These results suggested that UCNPs@COFs
could act as highly efficient potential fluorescent sensors for PFOS
with excellent selectivity.

Detection of PFOS in Real Samples
The applicability
of the elaborated method was validated by sensing PFOS in water and
food packing samples. To examine the recovery, tap water and food
packing samples were spiked with PFOS at three concentration levels;
the recoveries were in the range from 106 to 108% (Table 2) for tap water samples. The
repeatability was obtained by three replicate analysis of the spiked
solution, with recoveries in the range of 103–104% for food
packing samples and RSDs ranging from 2.7 to 4.0% (Table 3). The concentrations of PFOS
in the spiked tap water and food packing samples obtained by the present
sensing platform were compatible with those of spiked PFOS. These
results showed that the present method had great potential for sensing
PFOS in water and food packing materials.

Method Validation
To testify the accuracy of our method,
the same real samples were also analyzed by the LC–MS/MS technique.
The linear correlation with the PFOS concentration range of 3.6 ×
10–10–1.8 × 10–8 M
was developed. The equation was y = 8.05052 + 67.3301x (R2 = 0.996). The result of
the spike-recovery test by LC–MS/MS is shown in Table S1; the recoveries were 116% for the tap
water sample and 133% for the food packing sample for the same concentration
(1.8 × 10–10 M). The results show the reliability
of our proposed assay for the detection of PFOS.

Conclusions
In summary, a novel ultrasensitive fluorescence platform based
on surfactant-sensitized nanoparticles UCNPs@COFs was constructed
and applied to sense ultra-trace PFOS in water and food packing materials.
The core–shell nanoparticles UCNPs@COFs were synthesized via
the growth of COFs on the surface of UCNPs. The fluorescence response
of UCNPs@COFs to PFOS could be significantly enhanced by anion surfactants.
From the quenching mechanism, it was deduced that the layer of COFs
enriched more PFOS molecules into its pore channel in the presence
of SDBS, and the highly electronegative PFOS caused the fluorescence
quenching of UCNPs@COFs. Compared with previous reports, the proposed
method has the lowest limit of detection for PFOS. The excellent selectivity
and sensitivity coupled with facile preparation and high stability
make the present sensing platform an ideal candidate for sensing ultra-trace
PFOS in the future.

in KBr were collected with a Vector 22 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Bruker,
Germany). Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analyses were carried out
on a Siemens D5005 X-ray powder diffractometer at a scanning rate
of 1° min–1 in the 2θ range from 2 to
80° (Beckman coulter, Bruker). Thermogravimetry analyses (TGA)
were carried out on TGA/SDTA851 (METTLER TOLEDO) by heating samples
from 25 to 800 °C under N2 with a heating rate of
10 °C min–1. The quantum yield was measured
using an FLS920 homeostasis/transient fluorescence spectrometer (Edinburgh
Instrument, England) with a TCSPC system. Water contact angles were
measured on a DSA30 contact-angle system (KRÜSS, Germany) at
room temperature. Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry/mass
spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) data were determined on a Waters Acquity
UCLP Quattro Premier XE MS/MS with Waters Acquity UPLC sample manager
and a binary solvent manager. The suspension of UCNPs@COFs was performed
in an ultrasonic bath SBL-10DT (Ningbo Xinzhi Biotechnology Co. Ltd.,
China; peak power of 1000 W).

Preparation of UCNPs
UCNPs were prepared according
to the previous method.44 One millimolar
RE (CH3COO)3 ( Y/Yb/Er 78:20:2) was injected
into the solution of 6.0 mL of OA and 17.0 mL of ODE in a three-neck
round-bottom flask under argon atmosphere. After the temperature was
adjusted to 160 °C, the mixture was kept under vigorous stirring
for 30 min to form a transparent solution. After the system was cooled
to room temperature, 10.0 mL of the mixture consisting of 2.5 mM NaOH
and 4.0 mM NH4F in methanol was added, and the system was
kept for 30 min. Subsequently, methanol was removed from the system,
and then the temperature was adjusted to 300 °C. After the system
was maintained under the argon atmosphere with vigorous stirring for
1 h, UCNPs were collected via centrifugation at room temperature.
Finally, the resultant was washed with ethanol three times and dried
in air.

Preparation of UCNPs@NH2
Triton X-100 (0.1
mL), cyclohexane (6.0 mL), and UCNPs material (10 mM) were mixed in
a round flask at room temperature. After the solution was stirred
for 10 min, 80 μL of ammonia solution and 0.4 mL of Triton X-100
were injected sequentially. After the system was sealed and sonicated
for 20 min, an inverse microemulsion solution was formed. Subsequently,
40 μL of TEOS and 30 μL of APS were dropped slowly into
the mixture under stirring, and the system was kept at room temperature
for 24 h. Finally, UCNPs@NH2 material was collected by
washing with ethanol three times and dried.

Preparation of UCNPs@COFs
TFB (0.04 mM) was dissolved
in 1.0 mL of UCNPs@NH2 suspension (100 mg mL–1 in dioxane) in a 25 mL two-neck round-bottle flask. Then, PDA (6.46
mg in 1.0 mL dioxane, 0.06 mM) and 18.0 μL of acetic acid were
added. The system was kept at room temperature for 1 h. The mixture
(denoted seed solution) was used right away in the following procedures.

TFB (0.2 mM) and PDA (0.3 mM) were added into 1.0 mL of the seed
solution in a two-neck flask, where one neck was equipped with a condenser
and the other neck with a stopper. Subsequently, 90 μL of acetic
acid was added. Then, the temperature of the system was adjusted to
120 °C. The system was then maintained for 3 h. The precipitates
were collected via centrifugation at room temperature and washed with
DMF three times. Finally, the resultants were dried for 12 h under
vacuum.

Sensing PFOS
A stock solution of PFOS (3.7 × 10–4 M) was prepared by dissolving a proper amount of
the target in DMF, and various concentrations of the PFOS solution
were obtained by serial dilution of the stock solution with DMF. For
the detection of PFOS, 500 μL of UCNPs@COFs (0.02 mg·mL–1 mixed with 10 mM of SDBS in DMF) and 500 μL
of PFOS solution were poured into a 5.0 mL vial. Then, the mixture
was maintained for 10 min and transferred into a fluorescence quartz
cuvette. The fluorescence intensity at 550 nm was recorded under excitation
at 980 nm. F0 – F was used as an analytical signal, where F0 and F are the fluorescence intensity of the system
in the absence and presence of the PFOS, respectively. The selectivity
of the present sensor was evaluated by choosing six structural analogues
(PFDA, PFNA, PFOA, PFHpA, PFHxA, and PFHxS, as shown in Table S2) of PFOS as competitors.

Quantitation
of PFOS in Real Samples
Tap water and
food packing (plastic bottle) samples were chosen as real samples
to validate the applicability of the present approach. Tap water was
collected from the lab of Tianjin University of Science and Technology
and filtered through a nylon membrane (0.22 μm in diameter).
The samples were spiked with different levels of PFOS and then evaporated
to dryness by a rotary evaporator. Then, the residue was dissolved
in DMF (20.0 mL) to obtain the samples containing different concentrations
of PFOS (3.7 × 10–8, 3.7 × 10–10, and 3.7 × 10–12 M). Finally, 500 μL
of UCNPs@COFs (0.02 mg·mL–1 solution containing
10 mM of SDBS in DEMF) and 500 μL of the spiked samples were
mixed, and the fluorescence intensity of the system was measured.

Food packing sample was purchased from the local supermarket. Subsequently,
the plastic bottles were cut into pieces of approximately 1 cm2 with scissors. The samples (2.0 g, dry weight) were ultrasonically
spiked with three different levels of PFOS and then extracted with
20.0 mL of methanol under sonication for 25 min at 25 °C. Subsequently,
similar sample treatment procedures as water samples were performed.
