The metal salts of fatty acid (M-FA)
are the most widely used metal
precursors to colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs). They play
a key role in controlling the composition, shape, and size of semiconductor
NCs, and their purity is essential for attaining impeccable batch-to-batch
reproducibility in the optical and electrical properties of the NCs.
Herein, we report a novel, one-pot synthesis of a library of highly
pure M-FAs at near-quantitative yields (up to 91%) using 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene
or the related nonionic/noncoordinating base as an inexpensive and
ecofriendly catalyst in a green solvent medium. The method is highly
general and scalable with vast academic and industrial potential.
As a practical application, we also demonstrate the use of these high-quality
M-FAs in the synthesis of the spectrum of colloidal semiconductor
NCs (III–V, II–VI, IV–VI, I–VI, I–III–VI,
and perovskite) having absorption/emission in visible to the near-infrared
region.

1 Introduction
Because
a seminal paper by Brus et al. was published in 1983,1 colloidal synthesis has emerged as a powerful
and effective method to prepare high-quality inorganic nanocrystals
(NCs).2,3 The metal salts of fatty acids (M-FAs) are
the most common form of metal precursors in nearly all semiconductor
NC syntheses based on the hot injection method in the noncoordinating
solvent.4−11 In the colloidal synthesis of NCs, M-FA plays a crucial role in
solubilizing the metal ions, controlling the precursor reaction, nucleation
and growth processes, and passivating the surface and stabilizing
the colloidal dispersion.12−16 Therefore, the role of M-FAs is decisive for the evolution of crystal
phase,11 size,5 and shape17 and even the higher dimensional
assembly of the NCs17,18 with unique physical and chemical
properties. In addition to this, it is well-known that M-FAs are the
key ingredients in a plethora of industrial and domestic products
including cosmetics,19 lubricants,20−22 paints,23 biofuels,24,25 and rubber.26 Some of the common methods
employed for the synthesis of M-FA precursors are the (1) vacuum method;
(2) saponification method; (3) precipitation (double decomposition)
method; and (4) direct reaction of fatty acids with metals. Conventionally,
in the colloidal synthesis of semiconductor NCs, M-FAs are synthesized
by the “vacuum method” where metal acetate and the desired
fatty acid are vacuumed together at high temperature in high boiling
solvents.4,5,8,11,13 For example, for the
synthesis of InP NCs, the indium salt of fatty acid is prepared in
situ by the vacuum method prior to the reaction. Typically, a mixture
of In-acetate and fatty acid (myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic
acid, oleic acid or lauric acid) is mixed in a noncoordinating solvent
[1-octadecene (1-ODE)]5 and are vacuumed
at 110–130 °C for 1–2 h to obtain a “clear
solution” of indium carboxylate.5,13 Unfortunately,
there is no consensus about time, pressure, and temperature of this
method with respect to purity and composition of the M-FA formed in
situ, and this shortcoming may lead to batch-to-batch inconsistencies
in the properties of the NCs. Except for a few special cases,6,27,28 where M-FAs have been fully characterized,
the purity of the M-FA precursor in most cases were not confirmed
prior to the colloidal synthesis and characterization. Therefore,
given the sensitivity of these colloidal reactions and in view of
the uncertainty involved with the purity of M-FAs prepared by the
“vacuum method”, many of the kinetic studies and the
conclusions reported therein may not be fully accurate, especially
in quantitative studies. Recent reports have preferred pure M-FAs
prepared ex situ for the synthesis and kinetic studies of NCs, emphasizing
on the growing importance of the compositional purity of the precursor.6,29 For example, Owen and coworkers6 synthesized
highly pure lead oleate directly from lead oxide and oleic acid in
the presence of trifluoroacetic anhydride and triethylamine. They
employed the pure lead oleate to study the kinetics of lead chalcogenide
formation from a library of thiourea precursors. In another report,
an iron oleate precursor was synthesized from ferric chloride and
sodium oleate.29 This method is based on
the first saponification of fatty acid with an inorganic base such
as NaOH or KOH followed by the reaction of the alkali metal oleate
with chloride salts of the desired metal ions.30,31 Other strategies for the synthesis of M-FA (M = Zn, Ca) include
precipitation of M-FA via the double decomposition reaction32,33 and the direct reaction of fatty acids with some metals.34 However, most of these methods suffer from some
pitfalls such as the presence of the free fatty acid impurity (e.g.
the vacuum method), limited substrate scope (e.g. the precipitation
method), poor atom economy, and lengthy reactions involving multiple
steps (e.g. the saponification and double decomposition method). For
example, the saponification and double precipitation methods first
require fatty acids to be converted into alkali metal salts using
the inorganic base, which will be subsequently purified, isolated,
and then used for the preparation of other M-FAs. Clearly, there is
a need for the development of a more general and simpler method to
address the aforementioned drawbacks. Herein, we report a new approach
to access a library of pure M-FA precursors in high yield by direct
reaction of commercially available fatty acids with metal salts in
the presence of a noncoordinating, sterically hindered organic base
as an inexpensive and benign catalyst. The method is one-step and
does not require an additional purification step.

2 Results and Discussion
We noted that the direct reaction
of fatty acids with the corresponding
metal chlorides essentially required an inorganic base to promote
the reaction. However, the use of inorganic bases such as NaOH or
KOH is not desirable in many cases because alkali metal ions compete
with other intended metal ions in the reaction. This issue could be
addressed by the use of nonionic, noncoordinating organic bases having
a lower affinity toward metal ions. An ideal candidate would be a
strong nitrogenous organic base, that is, accessible, nontoxic, and
stable. In this context, initially, we screened 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane
(DABCO) for the direct synthesis of M-FA from fatty acid and metal
salt in one step. DABCO is an inexpensive, commercially available,
and environmentally benign organic base.35 It is sufficiently basic (pKa conjugate
acid ∼8.7) to abstract proton from fatty acids36 and is an effective catalyst in many organic transformations
such as the Baylis–Hillman reaction,37 chlorination of alkenes via activation of N-chlorosuccinimide,38 and so forth. To access the feasibility of obtaining
M-FA in a single step, we carried out a one-pot substitution reaction
between 3.0 equiv of stearic acid (1a) and 1.0 equiv
of indium trichloride (2a) in the presence of 4.0 equiv
of DABCO, under reflux conditions in 7:4:3 ratio of hexane/ethanol/water
as a green biphasic solvent mixture. We used DABCO as a base in slightly
above stoichiometric amounts (4.0 equiv base compared to the fatty
acid) in our initial experiments with the sole objective to promote
complete deprotonation of fatty acids. The reaction yielded indium
stearate (3a) in 72% yield in the pure form (Scheme 1).

Scheme 1 Reaction of Stearic
Acid (1a) with Indium Trichloride
(2a) to Obtain Indium Stearate (3a)
The biphasic nature of the solvent mixture,
that is, the hexane/ethanol/water
(7:4:3) system39 simplifies the isolation
of the product which is extracted from the nonpolar hexane part, whereas
the ionic impurities including the base and other byproducts remain
in the aqueous/ethanol part, thus ensuring the high purity of the
product. Figure 1 shows
the characteristic asymmetric COO– stretching band
centered around 1525 cm–1 for the intended product,
indium stearate (3a),40 which
is clearly distinguishable from the sharp C=O stretching peak
at ∼1712 cm–1 for the free fatty acid (1a). Furthermore, the −OH (bending) and −COOH
(bending) characteristic of 1a at 940 and 1296 cm–1 was also not detected in the product 3a. The thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results show the ∼85%
decrease in weight in the temperature range 150–500 °C
consistent with the loss of three stearate groups (Figure S1). Above 500 °C, constancy in the weight loss
exemplified the complete decomposition of indium stearate to afford
In2O3. 1H and 13C NMR
further confirmed the formation of 3a (Figures S2 and S3). The presence of three stearate groups
in the product was further confirmed by 1H NMR analysis
using 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene as the internal standard (Figure S4). The measured melting point of the
pure 3a is 145–148 °C.

(FTIR) spectrum of stearic acid (1a, black) and the indium
stearate (3a, red)
prepared from 1a. The characteristic stretching and bending
signatures related to carboxylic and carboxylate groups are marked
for clarity.

In principle, other nonionic/uncharged
nitrogenous bases with similar
attributes (basicity, noncoordinating, and a good leaving group) as
DABCO should also be effective for our reaction. In fact, we observed
the formation of the desired product using other organic bases such
as pyridine (aromatic amine), triethylamine (tertiary alkyl amine),
and 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) which is a sterically
hindered base (entries 1–4, Table 1). Based on our screening studies, the best
result was obtained with DBU which is a bicyclic amidine compound.
The result obtained with DBU was better than with DABCO or other bases
tested above which is possibly due to the higher basicity of DBU (pKa conjugate ∼13.5).41 It is well-known that the amidines are a stronger base
than the tertiary amine or amides and are among the strongest nonionic/uncharged
bases.42 DBU is a stable, inexpensive,
nontoxic,43 and accessible base commonly
used in organic transformation, therefore qualifying as an ideal candidate
for further studies and optimization. Using the reaction between indium
chloride and stearic acid in the presence of DBU as the model reaction,
we studied the effect of the concentration of the base, temperature,
and time on the reaction yield. In our studies so far, 4.0 equiv of
the base (compared to a fatty acid) were used (entries 1–4, Table 1) to facilitate complete
deprotonation of the carboxylic acid. To further understand the effect
of the base on the reaction, we decreased the amount of DBU from 4.0
to 0.5 equiv in succession. The entries 4–6 shows that the
yield of the desired product improved from an initial 78% (with 4.0
equiv DBU) to 85% (with 1.0 equiv DBU), when other conditions were
constant. However, further lowering the amount of DBU to 0.5 equiv
resulted in a decrease in the reaction yield to 66% (entry 7, Table 1). These results show
that the role of DBU is catalytic in nature. To study the effect of
temperature, we performed reactions at four different temperatures
(25, 40, 60 °C, and reflux temperature) using 1.0 equiv of DBU
(entries 6, 8–10, Table 1). While at room temperature, the reaction did not take place,
the maximum yield was obtained under reflux conditions. Likewise,
we investigated the effect of time for this transformation. When the
reaction mixture was refluxed for a short period of time (entries
11 and 12, Table 1),
the efficiency of the transformation was poor. Therefore, the reaction
condition detailed in entry 6 was marked as the best-optimized reaction
condition for our reaction. Furthermore, 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene
(DBN), a related amidine compound was also tested as a catalyst and
as expected a comparable product yield was achieved (entry 13, Table 1), thus underscoring
the effectiveness of analogous amidine compounds in general as a catalyst
for this reaction. The summary of the optimization studies is tabulated
below (Table 1).

Next, under optimized
conditions, we synthesized a large variety
of M-FAs (3b–t) on reacting a series of metal
salts (2a–p) with fatty acids (1a–e) in a single step using a catalytic amount of DBU (Scheme 2). All the substrates were
well-tolerated under optimized reaction conditions, and the corresponding
M-FAs (3b–t) were obtained in high yields (up
to 91%, entries 1–19, Table 2). Table 2 presents an overview of the substrate scope of our reaction. In
each case, the successful formation M-FAs was confirmed by the presence
of characteristic −COO– asymmetric (∼1510–1650
cm–1)44 in FTIR (Figures S5–S23). For some M-FAs, we observe
two asymmetric vibrations which are attributed to differences in the
nature of the M–O bonds in the compound.45−47 These results
show that the effect of coordination of the carboxylic ion with metal
and the nature of the M–O bonding is reflected in COO– asymmetric frequencies. The characteristic C=O stretching
vibration at slightly above 1700 cm–1 because of
free fatty acids34 (Figure S24) is absent in our samples (Figures S5–S23), confirming their high purity. Furthermore,
the TGA thermogram confirmed the weight % loss corresponding to the
number of carboxylate groups per metal ion in each case (Figures S5–S23). For M-FAs containing
diamagnetic metal ions, additional characterization was performed
using 1H and 13C NMR (Figures S25–S50) to confirm the formation of the desired products.
This method, thus, allows for the synthesis of highly pure M-FAs of
diverse metal ions positioned in various groups of the periodic table.
Specifically, we demonstrate the facile synthesis of M-FAs, where
M = K (alkaline metal), Mg (alkaline earth metal), Mn, Fe, Co, Ni,
Cu, Zn (first row transition metals), Ag, Cd (second row transition
metals), Al, Ga, In (triels; group IIIA), Sn, Pb (tetrels, group IVA),
and Gd (lanthanide). Especially, the carboxylates of group IIIA metals
such as aluminum, gallium, indium, and so forth are in general considered
difficult to synthesize under benign conditions because of the tendency
of group IIIA metals to form a bond with a more covalent character.14 On the contrary, our method demonstrates excellent
efficiency with nearly all metal ions.

3 Mechanism
From optimization studies
(entry 6, Table 1),
it is clear that the DBU is highly efficient
when used in a catalytic amounts. Unprotonated DBU has a characteristic
C=N stretching at 1608 cm–1 (Figure 2a), and free stearic acid has
C=O stretching at 1712 cm–1. When DBU and
fatty acids (stearic acid) are mixed and heated close to the reaction
temperature for 5 min, we observed a strong shift in C=N stretching
to 1647 cm–1 which is attributed to the protonation
of DBU. This observation, taken together with the detection of a shift
of C=O stretching of fatty acid from 1712 to 1557 cm–1 unambiguously confirms the formation of the intermediate A (Figure 2) during
the initial stage of the reaction. A similar observation has been
reported for protonation of DBU by Pripol 1009, a commercially available
bio-based fatty acid dimer.48 After the
reaction is complete, we carefully analyzed the aqueous fraction of
the biphasic solution system using FTIR. The extracted byproduct (aqueous
fraction) exhibited C=N stretching at 1650 cm–1, a slight deviation from the intermediate A. In addition,
we did not detect any carboxylate signature in this fraction, confirming
the presence of the intermediate B which contains halide
or nitrate as counter-ions. In other words, we detected the halide
or nitrate salt of DBU in the solution after the reaction is completed
(Figure 2a). Based
on these observations, we propose a simple anion exchange mechanism
involving DBU as a catalyst as depicted in Figure 2b.

Figure 2 (a) FTIR spectra of the starting compound stearic
acid (1a, black), the pristine DBU catalyst (red), a
mixture of stearic acid
and DBU heated to the reaction temperature for 5 min (intermediate A, blue) and the aqueous part of the reaction mixture after
13 h of reaction (intermediate B, green) and (b) proposed
mechanistic pathway for the DBU-catalyzed synthesis of M-FAs.

Thus, the reaction proceeds via deprotonation of
the carboxylic
functionality of fatty acid (1a) in the presence of DBU
under reflux conditions to generate the corresponding intermediate A (Figure 2), which further takes part in the anion exchange reaction with metal
salt (2) to form intermediate B followed
by the expulsion of halogen acid (HX) from B to generate
DBU (the base catalyst) which further enters into another catalytic
cycle. The driving force for the transformation of intermediate A to B in the presence of metal salt is the strong
oxyphilic nature of the metal ions.49,50

4 Multigram Scale Synthesis
Because most of these M-FAs have
potential commercial use, the
scale-up of the reaction is desirable. We demonstrate the successful
extension of our protocol to the multigram synthesis of M-FA. As a
representative example, 5.0 g of ZnCl2 (2i) was reacted with 20.0 g of stearic acid (1a) in the
presence of 5.5 mL DBU under optimized reaction conditions to obtain
the corresponding zinc stearate (3i) in 19.7 g (86% yield, Figure 3a). The products
were isolated in a pure form directly from the hexane fraction and
characterized using FTIR (Figure 3b), NMR (Figures S33 and S34), and TGA (Figure S12). The measured
melting point of the product obtained using the digital melting point
apparatus was 128–130 °C, which is consistent with the
literature value (130 °C).51 This
further confirms the high purity of the product formed.

5 Application
5.1 Synthesis of Colloidal Semiconductor NCs from
the As-Prepared M-FA Precursors
The easy access to the library
of highly pure M-FAs has tremendous importance in the growing field
of colloidal semiconductor NCs or quantum dots exhibiting a unique
optical and electrical property in the quantum confinement regime.52,53 In particular, we expect that our method will allow for the more
precise study of reaction kinetics and efficient control of the properties
of the NCs for meaningful application in many technologically important
areas including optoelectronics,54 photovoltaics,55 bio-molecular imaging,56,57 and photocatalysis.58,59 We demonstrate the colloidal
synthesis of different types of a semiconductor NCs such as CsPbBr3 perovskite, PbS (IV–VI),6 CdSe (II–VI),3 CuFeS2 (I–III–VI),60 Ag2S (I–VI),61 and InP (III–V)5 NCs using pure M-FAs obtained from this work
(Table 3). All these
materials are widely studied and applied for a range of applications
such as photovoltaics (PbS and CuFeS2),62,63 light-emitting diodes (CdSe, InP, and CsPbBr3),64−66 bio-imaging in visible and near-infrared (InP and Ag2S)67,68 regions, and photocatalysis of organic transformation
(CsPbBr3, CdSe, and InP).69−71 The respective M-FAs
employed for the synthesis of these NCs are listed in Table 3, and their synthetic details
are furnished in the Experimental Section.
The NCs synthesized were highly stable as colloidal dispersion (Figure S51) and exhibited their characteristic
optical properties (Figures 4 and S52). The powdered X-ray diffraction
(PXRD) studies confirmed their crystal structure and high phase purity
(Figure 5). The absorption
and emission band widths expressed as half-width at half maximum (HWHM)
or full-width at half maximum (fwhm) of the NCs were comparable to
those reported for conventionally prepared NCs.72−75

6 Conclusions
In summary, we demonstrated an easy, scalable, and generalized
methodology for the synthesis of highly pure M-FAs with metal ions
from all blocks (s, p, d, and f blocks) of the periodic table. The
sterically hindered, noncoordinating DBU and the analogous base were
found to catalyze the formation of M-FAs via the abstraction of a
proton from fatty acid to form fatty acid salt followed by anion exchange
with a metal salt. The method was highly scalable, and the products
were obtained on a multigram scale. The practical use of this methodology
is also presented by using the as-synthesized M-FAs as the metal precursors
for the formation of various semiconductor NCs such as CsPbBr3, InP, PbS, CdSe, CuFeS2, and Ag2S.
We believe that our findings would be valuable for both academic and
industrial settings with wide applications in the field of colloidal
NCs, surfactants, emulsions, and so forth.

mL of 1-ODE and degassed for 30 min at room temperature followed by
30 min at 120 °C. The reaction vessel was back-filled with nitrogen
and heated to 200 °C. At this temperature, cesium oleate solution
(0.4 mL) was injected. After 10 s the reaction vessel was quenched
by immersing in an ice bath. The purification was carried out through
a centrifugation method, where 4 mL of crude solution was mixed with
4 mL of anhydrous toluene and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min.
The supernatant was discarded, and the solid residue was washed again
with anhydrous toluene at 5000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the purified
CsPbBr3 NCs were dispersed in anhydrous hexane.

7.4 Preparation of CdSe NCs Using the As-Synthesized
Cadmium Stearate (3k)

synthesized following the method reported earlier with slight modification.3,4 Briefly, 0.068 g (0.1 mmol) of cadmium stearate, 0.147 mL (0.5 mmol)
of oleylamine, and 6 mL of 1-ODE were heated at 120 °C under
vacuum for 1 h. After 1 h the flask was back-filled with nitrogen,
and the reaction mixture was slowly heated to 150 °C. Separately,
0.15 g (1.9 mmol) of selenium powder was dissolved in 2 mL of trioctylphosphine.
This solution was injected into the formerly prepared cadmium stearate
solution to obtain CdSe NCs. The purification was done by taking 5
mL of crude solution and mixing with anhydrous toluene and anhydrous
ethanol (1:4). The mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min.
The supernatant was discarded, and the solid residue was centrifuged
again following the same procedure. After washing the CdSe NCs for
three times, it was dispersed in anhydrous hexane.

The flask was back-filled with nitrogen, and the temperature was brought
down to 80 °C. Separately the 1,3-diphenyl thiourea prepared
in the lab was dissolved in 1,2-dimethoxyethane and then injected
in the reaction mixture. After the injection, the reaction was carried
out for 15 min to obtain a black coloration of PbS NCs. For purification,
the crude 4 mL of anhydrous toluene and 16 mL of anhydrous ethanol
was added to 4 mL of crude PbS NCs, and the mixture was centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The residue obtained was washed three times
using the same method. The purified NCs were dispersed in hexane.

mmol) of silver stearate was mixed with 3 mL of 1-ODE and was vacuumed
for 1 h at room temperature. After 1 h, the reaction temperature was
increased to 100 °C and the degassing was continued for 30 min.
This silver stearate solution was back-filled with nitrogen and the
temperature was increased to 140 °C. Separately, 0.023 g (0.1
mmol) of 1,3-diphenyl thiourea and 0.3 mL of 1-DDT was vacuumed for
1 h at room temperature. This solution was swiftly injected into the
silver stearate solution and was kept at 140 °C for 5 min. After
5 min, the reaction was allowed to come down to room temperature.
The purification was carried out through a centrifugation method,
where 3 mL of crude solution was mixed with 3 mL of anhydrous ethanol
and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded,
and the residue was washed again with anhydrous ethanol. This process
was repeated two times. The final two washing was done with a mixture
of anhydrous ethanol and anhydrous hexane (3:1) and centrifuged at
5000 rpm for 5 min. Finally, the purified Ag2S NCs were
dispersed in anhydrous hexane.

with 2.5 mL of oleylamine and 1 mL of 1-ODE, and it was heated at
120 °C under vacuum for 30 min. Under nitrogen, the temperature
was increased to 160 °C, and it was kept at this temperature.
0.090 g (0.1 mmol) of iron stearate and 0.063 g (0.1 mmol) of copper
stearate was mixed with 3 mL of 1-ODE. The mixture was degassed for
1 h at 120 °C. The reaction flask was filled with nitrogen, and
1.5 mL of dodecanethiol was added. The temperature of the reaction
was slowly increased to 180 °C. Sulfur solution was injected
dropwise. After the addition of sulfur, the reaction was continued
for another 10 min and then quenched in cold water. The purification
was carried out through a centrifugation method, where 4 mL of crude
solution was mixed with 4 mL of anhydrous toluene and 16 mL of anhydrous
ethanol and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was
discarded, and the solid residue was washed again with a (1:4) hexane/ethanol
mixture at 5000 rpm for 5 min. The NCs were finally centrifuged with
the same solvent mixture at 5000 rpm for 3 min to obtain purified
CuFeS2 NCs. The purified NCs were dispersed in hexane.
