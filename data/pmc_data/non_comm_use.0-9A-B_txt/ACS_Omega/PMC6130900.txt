A newly
designed cyanide-selective chemosensor based on chromone
containing benzothiazole groups [3-(2,3-dihydro-benzothiazol-2-yl)-chromen-4-one
(DBTC)] was synthesized and structurally characterized
by physico-chemical, spectroscopic, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction
analyses. The compound DBTC can detect cyanide anions
based on nucleophilic addition as low as 5.76 nM in dimethyl sulfoxide–N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic
acid buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3). The binding mode between
receptor DBTC and cyanide nucleophile has also been demonstrated
by experimental studies using various spectroscopic tools and theoretical
studies, and the experimental work has also been verified by characterizing
one supporting compound of similar probable structure of the final
product formed between DBTC and cyanide ion (DBTC–CN compound) by single-crystal X-ray analysis for detailed structural
analyses. In theoretical study, density functional theory procedures
have been used to calculate the molecular structure and the calculation
of the Fukui function for evaluation of the electrophilic properties
of each individual acceptor atom. Furthermore, the efficacy of the
probe (DBTC) to detect the distribution of CN– ions in living cells has been checked by acquiring the fluorescence
image using a confocal microscope. Notably, the paper strips with DBTC were prepared, and these could serve as efficient and
suitable CN– test kits successfully.

1 Introduction
The
detection and recognition of anionic analytes have become a
field of a huge awareness in recent years.1−8 Among a wide range of anions, cyanide (CN–) ion
has been paid considerable attention because of its acutely toxicity;
existence in many natural sources such as apple seeds, cassava, and
peach kernel and production by certain microbes such as fungus and
bacteria.9−11 In human body, this cyanide ion binds with iron within
the protein strongly, which inhibit the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase process and hinder the electron transport; and
in turn, this results in vomiting and convulsion and then loss of
consciousness and eventual death.12,13 However, in
numerous industrial processes, cyanide as an important chemical anion
plays an imperative role in many areas, for example, electroplating
and case-hardening of metals, gold mining and extraction, and synthesis
of resins, fibers, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and intermediates,
and so on.14−18 As a result, different international, national, and local regulations
and guidelines regularize the level of cyanide in air, water, and
other media.19 The maximum contaminant
level for cyanide set by the US EPA in drinking water is 200 g L–1 where as it is 70 g L–1 by the
World Health Organization limit in drinking water.20,21 In spite of the acute toxicity, lower limits of cyanide ion is required
for ecosystems and it is as much as 4 and 2 g L–1 set by the Australian and New Zealand Environmental and Conservation
Council, respectively, to protect the 99% of the species in the freshwater
and marine water.22 Thus, it has been an
utmost crucial task to exploit effective ways for monitoring the presence
of cyanide anion, and ultimately, the development of highly selective
chemosensor for cyanide ion has become the cynosure to the chemists.

Conventional techniques such as potentiometry,23 electrochemical,24 polarography,25 simple titrations,26 and flow injection amperometric27 are
time-consuming. Therefore, there is an increasing demand of development
of more efficient and sensitive methods to measure cyanide ions directly
at the microgram/liter level in different matrices. In this context,
fluorescent chemosensors for cyanide ions are significantly attractive
because of low cost and present numerous advantages, including high
sensitivity and easy operation.28,29

CN– selective receptors based on the mechanism
of nucleophilic addition reactions,30−34 hydrogen-bonding interactions,35,36 coordination,37 sol–gel technique,38 ion recognition,39−44 and metal-cyanide affinity (displacement approach)45−47 have been reported. In this regard, various organic compounds have
been employed as the fluorophore moiety was exploited as sensors for
cyanide, hitherto, naphthalene,48,49 naphthalimide,50 coumarin,51 indole,52 BODIPY,53 phenothiazine,54 phenazine55 but chromone-based
selective CN– anion chemosensors are still unexplored.

However, there are a very few “turn-on” and “ratiometric”
cyanide sensing probes in the literature.56,57 As the molecular systems of the enhanced/ratiometric fluorescence
signal response with the addition of the target analyte are generally
superior in response to those systems of the “turn-off”
or quenching fluorescence signals, the design of cyanide-selective
chemosensors based on off-on/ratiometric signaling pathway is a very
meaningful and demanding task. Herein, we have designed, synthesized,
and structurally characterized a new chromone-based ratiometric chemosensor
probe [3-(2,3-dihydro-benzothiazol-2-yl)-chromen-4-one (DBTC)] which selectively senses CN– ions as low as 5.76
nM in dimethyl sulfoxide–N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine-N′-ethanesulfonic acid (DMSO–HEPES) buffer
(20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3). The probe (DBTC) is competent
of detecting and sensing the distribution of CN– ions in living cells, which was confirmed by a confocal microscope.
Moreover, the DBTC-based paper strips can also be used
as CN– ion test kits as these strips remarkably
senses CN– ions.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Synthesis of the DBTC
The organic moiety DBTC was synthesized
by condensation
of 3-formylchromone with 2-aminothiophenol (1:1 mole ratio) in anhydrous
ethanol (Scheme 1).
After cooling, the yellow-colored precipitate was obtained, washed
with hot ethanol two times, and then dried giving a yellow-colored
shiny crystalline compound. Its chemical structure was well characterized
by electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry, 1H
NMR, 13C NMR, and infrared (IR) spectra (Figures S1–S4, Supporting Information) and elemental analysis.
Finally, the confirmation of the structure of the organic moiety (DBTC) was established by single-crystal X-ray crystallographic
analysis (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Structural
representation and atom numbering scheme of DBTC.

Scheme 1 Synthetic Procedure of the Probe DBTC and DBTC–CN Complex
Light yellow block-shaped crystals of DBTC suitable
for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained after
15 days of slow evaporation of an ethanol solution. DBTC crystallized into the monoclinic space group P21/n with Z = 4 and cell volume
1232.19 (Table S1). The organic moiety
of DBTC has excellent planarity between chromone and
benzothiazole ring with the dihedral angle 3.65°, which is beneficial
to green fluorescence properties. A schematic view of the DBTC motif is shown in Figure 1; the selected bond lengths and angles are tabulated in Tables
S1 and S2 in the Supporting Information.

2.2 Synthesis of the DBTC–CN Complex
The ethanolic solution of DBTC and
aqueous solution of NaCN is mixed in equimolar ratio, and the resulting
mixture was stirred for 2 h (Scheme 1). The clear resulting solution was filtered, and after
three weeks, a reddish black color precipitate was obtained. The DBTC–CN complex was characterized by ESI mass and 1H NMR, 13C NMR, and IR spectra (Figures S5–S8).

The emission spectra of DBTC studied in different solvents of varying polarity (Figure 2) show the largely
red-shifted fluorescence spectra of DBTC with the increase
of the solvent polarity. This trend of the characteristic peaks is
in support of the ICT pathway as in polar solvents (CH3CN, DMSO, EtOH, and MeOH) the charge-transfer emission is very significant.

Figure 2 Emission
spectra of DBTC (λex = 370
nm) in toluene, dichloromethane, CHCl3, dimethylformamide,
CH3CN, DMSO, EtOH, and MeOH solvents.

2.3 UV–Visible Studies
The absorption
spectrophotometric titration in HEPES (20 mM) buffer at pH 7.4 was
carried out at 37 °C to understand the mode of interaction of DBTC with CN– ions, and it is depicted in Figure 3 which demonstrates
the UV–vis titration curve of DBTC with added
CN– ion.

Figure 3 Absorption spectra of DBTC (10
μM) in DMSO–HEPES
buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3) upon the titration with CN– ion solution.

With the stepwise increase of the concentration of added
CN– ions, the absorption intensity of DBTC at 350 nm gradually decreases with the appearance of new peaks of
weak absorption intensity at 305 and 460 nm. The phenomenon of increase
of new peaks with the increase of cyanide ions is due to the interaction
of the probe (DBTC) with CN– ion.

2.4 pH Studies
The role of CN– ions in biological systems is significantly noteworthy. Therefore,
it is imperative of having an efficient sensing probe applicable for
detection of cyanide ions over a wide range of pH. To verify the pH
effect, the emission spectra (at λem = 430 nm) of
the probe (DBTC) (10 μM) without and with CN– (1 equiv) were recorded over a wide range of pH 4–12
(Figure S9). This study clearly indicates
that the detection of CN– ions is possible at the
biological pH 7.4 in DMSO–HEPES buffered solution (1:3 v/v).

2.5 Fluorescence Studies
The fluorescence
profiles of DBTC and their potential CN– reaction products are even more distinct than their corresponding
UV–vis spectra. The fluorescence intensity dramatically enhances
at λem = 430 nm with the progress of time (Figure S10). A considerable effect on the emission
profile of DBTC was observed because of the incremental
addition of CN– ions. Here, a huge blue shift of
the fluorescence maximum from 540 to 430 nm through an isoemissive
point at 505 nm was recorded, and it is of about 110 nm (Figure 4). It is noteworthy
to mention that the fluorescence intensity at 540 nm was gradually
decreased with concomitant increase of the newly appeared fluorescence
maxima at 430 nm. Interestingly, a plateau was obtained after 10 equiv
addition of CN– ions. This emission profile clearly
suggests the formation of a well-defined DBTC–CN compound.

Figure 4 Fluorescence spectra of DBTC (10 μM) upon the
addition of 0–10 equiv CN– anion in DMSO–HEPES
buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3).

In addition, from this study, it is observed that the ratio
of
the emission intensities at 430 and 540 nm (I430/I540) increased to 9.9 from
0.24 (∼41-fold enhancement) upon the gradual addition of CN– ions (inset of Figure 4). This result significantly designates the probe (DBTC) as a ratiometric fluorescent chemosensor for CN– ions. This spectroscopic change has been supported
by the visual color change of the DBTC solution of DBTC from green to blue because of the addition of 10 equiv
CN– ions upon excitation by a hand held UV lamp
of 370 nm (Figure 4, inset).

These fluorescence spectral data were used to draw
the Job’s
plot (Figure S11) curves to calculate the
stoichiometry of the interaction of the DBTC receptors
with cyanide ions. This curve with the maxima at ∼0.5 mole
fraction dictates the formation of 1:1 (receptor/cyanide ion) ensemble/compound.
From the fluorescence titration data, the binding constant toward
the formation of the DBTC–CN compound was calculated
to be 4.25 × 105 M–1 using the modified
Benesi–Hildebrand equation66 corresponding
to 1:1 stoichiometry.  where F0, Fx, and F∞ are the emission intensities of DBTC in the absence
of CN– ions, at an intermediate CN– ion concentration, and at a concentration of complete interaction,
respectively, and where K is the binding constant
and [C] is the CN– ion concentration.
From the intercept/slope of the plot of (F∞ – F0)/(Fx – F0) against [C]−1 (Figure 5), the K value was determined
to be 4.25 × 105 M–1 which clearly
indicates that DBTC has a significantly strong binding
affinity toward the CN– ions.

Figure 5 Plot of (F∞ – F0)/(Fx – F0) against
1/[CN]−1: Binding
constant (K) of 4.25 × 105 M–1 for CN– ions with DBTC.

To find the limit of detection
of CN– by the
probe, that is, how lower amount (minimum concentration) of CN– anion can be estimated by the probe (DBTC), from the fluorescence titration study, it was found that minimum
5.76 nM CN– anion can develop the fluorescence intensity
ratio (I430/I540) of DBTC (Figure 6).

Figure 6 Plot for the estimation of LOD for cyanide ions in the
DMSO–HEPES
buffer (20 mM) solution (v/v = 1:3) at pH 7.4.

Therefore, the detection limit (LOD) of DBTC for CN– ions was calculated to be 5.76 nM by the
use of the
equation 3σ/S (where S = gradient
of the calibration curve and σ is the standard deviation at
zero level).67 This LOD value (5.76 nM)
of DBTC for CN– ions calculated from
this method is significantly lower than that of MCL.

To evaluate
the sensing selectivity of DBTC, fluorescence
changes toward CN–, various anions were verified
in replicate experiments under the same conditions. Among various
competing anions, only cyanide ions incredible response of the fluorescence
intensity ratio (I430/I540), whereas the other anions such as SCN–, F–, Cl–, Br–, I–, ClO–, ClO4–, N3–, NO2–, NO3–, H2PO4–, H2AsO4–, HCO3–, HS–, S2–, HSO3–, HSO4–, and AcO– did not bring any
significant change in the emission intensity ratio (I430/I540) plot (viz., Figure S12). This is reasonable considering the
stronger nucleophilicity of cyanide compared with other anions. In
addition, to verify the interference, we evaluate the fluorescence
response of DBTC with CN– in the presence
of other competitive anions and cations (viz., Figures S13 and S14), which clearly showed that the signal
response of DBTC induced by CN– was
not hampered at any extent by the presence of other different anions
and cations.

2.6 Density Functional Theoretical
Studies
To investigate the mechanism of the ratiometric response
of probe DBTC to cyanide ion, density functional theory
(DFT) calculations
were carried out for the probe DBTC and DBTC–CN compound with the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. The optimized geometries
of DBTC and DBTC–CN compound are
shown in Figure 7. DBTC was almost planar, with a dihedral angle of 3.65°
between the chromone and benzothiazole moiety which make this two
groups in good conjugation, whereas the DBTC–CN compound reveals a tilted conformation with dihedral angle 19.80°,
indicating a hampered conjugation. Therefore, the ICT process between
chromone and benzothiazole group could proceed efficiently in probe DBTC but be inhibited in the DBTC–CN compound.
This reduced ICT character of the probe is due to the disruption of
the π-conjugation in the DBTC–CN compound,
and in turn, the significant blue shift in the emission spectrum is
occurred. It is also well supported by considering the comparison
of HOMO–LUMO energy band gaps of DBTC–CN compound which is lower than DBTC.

Figure 7 HOMO–LUMO energy
calculation and optimized structure of DBTC and DBTC–CN compound.

The time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) calculations show two important
peaks in the 252.44 and 331.65 nm UV spectra of DBTC in
water. The band around 331.65 nm is governed by the HOMO →
LUMO excitations, and the band around 252.44 nm is essentially due
to HOMO – 8 → LUMO + 1; HOMO – 7 → LUMO
+ 1; HOMO – 7 →LUMO + 4; HOMO – 7 → LUMO
+ 6; HOMO – 4 → LUMO + 1; HOMO – 4 → LUMO
+ 4; and HOMO – 4 → LUMO + 6 transitions (Figure S15). In the case of DBTC–CN compound, the calculated band around 467.87 nm is attributable to
the HOMO – 2 → LUMO; HOMO – 2 → LUMO +
2; HOMO – 1 → LUMO; HOMO – 1 → LUMO +
1; HOMO → LUMO; and HOMO → LUMO + 2 transitions (Figure S16). All of the detailed vertical excitation
energies, oscillator strengths, and salient transitions are tabulated
in Tables S4 and S5.

To recognize
the most suitable atoms for nucleophilic attack,68 the condensed Fukui function values fk+ may be used.
These values were calculated to examine the electrophilicity properties
of the acceptor atoms of the probe DBTC. Selected fk+ values are given
in Table 1, considering
the atom numbering scheme, viz., Figure 1.

Table 1 Selected fk+ Values Calculated
for DBTC
atom	C7	C8	C9	C10	
fk+	0.0299	–0.0169	0.1244	0.0524	
On the basis of the calculated values of the Fukui
functions (viz., Table 1), it may be concluded
that the C9 acceptor atoms may be predictable to be much stronger
acceptor atoms than the C7, C8, and C9 atoms. Hence, CN– anion (nucleophile) can attack the C9 carbon atom which is the most
electrophilic center in the DBTC probe. Unfortunately,
we failed to get the single crystals of the product, the DBTC–CN compound diffractable for single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis
although the probable structure of the DBTC–CN compound has been established by various spectroscopic analyses
(ESI mass: Figure S5, 1H NMR: Figure S6, 13C NMR: Figure S7 and IR: Figure S8). In
addition, the analogue compound (DBTC-OCH3 (1)) having the methoxy group (similar nucleophile
as cyanide) has been isolated from the same chemical environment using
methanol to establish the fact of the formation of the DBTC–CN compound in the ethanol–cyanide mixture. Fortunately, the
detailed structure analysis of the compound, DBTC-OCH3 (1), has been carried out
by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis (Figure 8). This structural analysis (Table S3) dictates the possibility of nucleophilic
addition of cyanide ion to the C9 carbon atom of the chromone moiety
of DBTC to produce the DBTC–CN compound.

Figure 8 Crystal
structures of the compound DBTC-OCH3(1).

On the basis of all spectroscopic and theoretical observations,
the plausible sensing pathway has been depicted in Scheme 2.

2.7 Cell
Imaging Studies
To validate
the efficacy of this probe having significant fluorescence color change
in solution, some test strips were prepared by immersing filter papers
in the DMSO/H2O solution of DBTC (1.0 mM)
and then dried in air. The DBTC-based test strips were
dipped in several aqueous media of CN– ions of different
concentrations, and the fluorescence color change from green to blue
was observed with gradually increasing concentration of cyanide ions
(Figure 9). Therefore,
this interesting experiment reflects that the DBTC-based
test strips can suitably detect CN– in solutions
without any other tools.

Figure 9 Photographs of only DBTC (1.0 mM)
and after immersion
into water solutions with increasing CN– anion on
test strips at room temperature and irradiation under UV light at
370 nm.

To examine the effectiveness of
the probe for CN– ion detection in biological systems,
it was performed using human
breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA. In these experiments, both the DBTC and CN– ions were allowed to uptake
by the cells of interest and the images of the cells were recorded
by the fluorescence microscopy, following excitation at ∼370
nm. Incubation of DBTC alone showed green fluorescence
uptake even after 90 min. Uptake into MDA cells was boosted upon using
cyanide anion showed blue fluorescence (Figure 10).

Figure 10 Confocal fluorescence microscopy images of
MDA cells with DBTC only and DBTC plus cyanide
ions at 37 °C.

To verify the compatibility
of uses of this probe in the living
cells, the cytotoxic effect of the probe (DBTC) was tested
against breast adenocarcinoma cells MDA using a regular method, the
MTT assay.69 The probe (DBTC) showed about 80% cell survivability at their working concentration
[100 μg/mL for probe (DBTC)] after 1 and 24 h of
incubation both the cases toward cancer cells. Therefore, the probe
(DBTC) at a concentration of 100 μg/mL can be used
safely for the purpose of fluorescence imaging of cancer cells (Figure S17).

3 Conclusions
Herein, we have developed an easy to synthesize and structurally
characterized potential ratiometric probe (DBTC) which
detects CN– ions fluorimetrically as low as 5.76
nM anions based on nucleophilic addition in the DMSO–HEPES
buffer (20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3). Interestingly, the probe (DBTC) shows the incredible response for cyanide ions specifically
over other common anions. This significantly enhanced fluorescence
intensity is due to the nucleophilic addition of the nucleophile cyanide
ion to the C9 carbon atom of the chromone moiety to form DBTC–CN compound, and it is well supported by the isolation of DBTC-OCH3 (1), an analogue of DBTC–CN compound. The possibility of DBTC–CN compound is confirmed by the detailed spectroscopic techniques and
theoretical studies. The structural analysis of DBTC-OCH3 (1) also helps us to conclude
the feasibility of nucleophilic addition of potential nucleophile
(cyanide ion is more potential nucleophile than methoxide ion) to
the C9 carbon atom of the chromone moiety. This noncytotoxic probe
(DBTC) is competent of acquiring the images of the distribution
of cyanide ions in living bodies, and it was confirmed by the confocal
microscopic imaging. Again, it is also noteworthy that the DBTC-based paper strips can also be used as CN– ion
test kits as these strips sense CN– ions significantly.
This developed method of cyanide ion detection in the aqueous medium
is superior to the earlier reports (viz., Table S6) in terms of the detection limit and the solvent medium.
This ratiometric probe (DBTC) can sense as low as 5.76
nM CN– ions fluorimetrically, which is also lower
than the lowest value (30 nM CN– ions) of the reported
literature tabulated in the comparative table (Table S6).

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Materials and Methods
Standard procedures
have been performed to purify and dry the solvents used for spectroscopic
studies, but all other chemicals and reagents purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
were used without any purification. Solutions of the anions were prepared
from their sodium salts of cyanide, thiocyanate, arsenate, azide,
nitrite, nitrate, bicarbonate, hydrogen sulfide, hydrogen sulfite,
hydrogen sulfate, hypochlorite, chlorate, and tetrabutylammonium salts
of halides (F–, Cl–, Br–, and I–), acetate, and dihydrogen phosphate. In
HEPES (20 mM) buffered water at pH 7.4, all of the experiments for
titration were carried out at 25 °C.

Mass spectra were
recorded on a micrOTOF-Q mass spectrometer and XeVOG2QTof HRMS spectrometer
in methanol. H NMR was carried out using the Bruker AVANCE DPX 500
MHz spectrometer. Elemental analyses (C, H, and N) were carried out
with a PerkinElmer CHN analyzer 2400. A Systronics pH meter (model
335) was used for the pH measurements. Fourier transform IR (FTIR)
spectra were done as KBr pellets using a Prestige-21 FTIR spectrophotometers.

A yellow-colored crystal of DBTC was mounted on a
glass tip, and data were collected in a Bruker’s APEX-II CCD
diffractometer using MoKα (λ = 0.71069); necessary
corrections were applied using SADABS from Bruker.58 Fourier full-matrix least-squares refinement methods based
on F2, using SHELX-97 was used to refine
all of the nonhydrogen atoms anisotropically in order to solve the
structure.59 WinGX package was also utilized
for all of the calculations.60,61 As per the deposition
of the cif files with the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre,
the codes were allocated as CCDC—1835425 and 1835426 of DBTC and 1, respectively.

4.2 Theoretical
Calculation
The DFT method
at the B3LYP level62 with Gaussian-09 software
over a Red Hat Linux IBM cluster63 was
used for full geometry optimizations of DBTC and their
corresponding complexes. The 6-31G(d) basis set was employed for all
of the elements. Computation of vertical electronic excitations based
on B3LYP optimized geometry was performed using the time-dependent
DFT (TD-DFT)64 formalism in water with
the conductor-like polarizable continuum model65 to calculate the fractional contributions of various groups
to each molecular orbital.

4.3 General Procedure for Fluorescence
and Absorption
Study
Path length of the cells used for absorption and emission
studies was 1 cm. The fluorescence properties of the sensor were investigated
in DMSO–HEPES buffer solution (20 mM, pH 7.4) (v/v = 1:3).
Fluorescence measurements were performed using 5 × 5 nm slit
width. All of the fluorescence and absorbance spectra were taken after
30 min of mixing of CN– and DBTC.

4.3.1 Biological Methods
4.3.1.1 Cell Culture and Platting
Human
breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA was maintained in Dulbecco’s
modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum and 1% penicillin–streptomycin antibiotic solution in
a humidified CO2 incubator (5% CO2). The cells
were detached from a culture flask using trypsin–EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid) solution and washed in the growth medium. After final wash,
cells were plated into 96-well microtiter plates (4 × 103 cells per well) for the purpose of MTT assay and permitted
24 h to adhere. For the purpose of imaging, cells were seeded on 14
mm glass cover slips into a 6-well microtiter plate and allowed 24
h for complete adherence.

4.3.1.2 Imaging
Cells growing on glass
cover slips were incubated for 1.5 h with 100 μg/mL aqueous
solution of DBTC in the presence and absence of cyanide
ion solution (20 μL), containing 1% DMSO (v/v) to assist solubilization
of the compound. Followed by incubation, the cells were washed with
phosphate-buffered saline and mounted on grease free glass slide and
observed under a Leica TCS SP8, a confocal laser scanning fluorescence
microscope.

4.3.1.3 MTT Assay for the Assessment
Cytotoxicity
The cytotoxicity of the compound DBTC against human
breast adenocarcinoma cells MDA was assessed by exploring the colorimetric
and quantitative MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide] reduction assay. After complete adherence cells were treated
for 1 and 24 h separately in preoptimized doses (100 and 200 μg/mL)
of DBTC with or without cyanide ion solution (20 μL).
After completion of treatment, the cells were washed with complete
media and resuspended in MTT solution (0.5 mg/1 mL) and incubated
at 37 °C for 4 h at dark. Dark violet formazan crystals were
formed as a result of reaction between MTT and mitochondrial succinate
dehydrogenase enzyme (present only in living cells). The resulting
crystals were dissolved in DMSO. Cellular viability was determined
by quantifying the intensity of formazan crystal using a microplate
reader (Bio-Rad).
