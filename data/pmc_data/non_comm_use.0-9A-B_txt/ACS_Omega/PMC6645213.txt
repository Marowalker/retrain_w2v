A series of stable Pt(IV) corrole
complexes with the general formula
PtIV[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py), where TpXPC3– is the trianion of a tris(p-X-phenyl)corrole and X = CF3, H, and CH3,
has been synthesized, affording key physicochemical data on a rare
and elusive class of metallocorroles. Single-crystal X-ray structures
of two of the complexes revealed very short equatorial Pt–N
distances of 1.94–1.97 Å, an axial Pt–C distance
of ∼2.03 Å, and an axial Pt–N distance of ∼2.22
Å. The complexes exhibit Soret maxima at ∼430 nm, which
are essentially independent of the meso-aryl para
substituents, and strong Q bands with the most intense peak at 595–599
nm. The substituent-independent Soret maxima are consistent with an
innocent PtIV–corrole3– description
for the complexes. The low reduction potentials (−1.45 ±
0.08 V vs saturated calomel reference electrode) also support a highly
stable Pt(IV) ground state as opposed to a noninnocent corrole•2– description. The reductions, however, are
irreversible, which suggests that they involve concomitant cleavage
of the Pt–aryl bond. Unlike Pt(IV) porphyrins, two of the complexes,
PtIV[TpXPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) (X = CF3 and CH3), were
found to exhibit room-temperature near-IR phosphorescence with emission
maxima at 813 and 826 nm, respectively. The quantum yield of ∼0.3%
is comparable to those observed for six-coordinate Ir(III) corroles.

Introduction
The 5d metallocorroles
constitute a unique class of size-mismatched
complexes that incorporate a large 5d transition-metal ion within
a sterically constrained macrocyclic ligand.1 Despite a steric mismatch inherent in their structures, the majority
of them exhibit remarkable chemical and photochemical stabilities.
A number of them also exhibit room-temperature near-IR phosphorescence,2 which has led to applications as oxygen sensors3−5 and as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy and dye-sensitized
solar cells.6,7 Platinum(IV) corroles, of which
there has been only a single report,8 are
particularly intriguing because of their potential for axial reactivity.
They are, however, only accessible via a low-yielding, serendipitously
discovered reaction, which involves the interaction of a free-base
corrole and Pt4(OAc)8·2HOAc in benzonitrile
at high temperature. The initially formed Pt(IV) products, PtIV[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(PhCN), where TpXPC
is the trianion of a meso-tris(para-X-phenyl)corrole (X = CF3, H, and CH3) and
the m/p-C6H4CN group derives from the solvent (i.e., PhCN), proved unstable,
but could be derivatized to stable, paramagnetic products PtIV[TpXPC•2–](m/p-C6H4CN)(Ar), which proved
amenable to single-crystal X-ray structure determination.8 Here, we report that in situ exposure of the
initially formed Pt(IV)-PhCN products to pyridine leads to a new class
of stable, nonradical Pt(IV) corroles with the general formula PtIV[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py), which have been variously characterized
with single-crystal X-ray structure determination, electrochemical
studies, and UV–vis–NIR absorption and emission spectroscopy
(Figure 1). Although
the results represent modest progress from a synthetic viewpoint,
the physicochemical measurements afford significant insight into the
electronic properties of a rare and elusive class of substances.

Results and Discussion
As mentioned
above, the Pt(IV) corroles PtIV[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py) (X
= CF3, H, and CH3)
were obtained rather simply by the addition of pyridine to the reaction
mixture at the end of the Pt insertion. For all compounds, purity
and composition were established via thin-layer chromatography, high-resolution
electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, and 1H NMR spectroscopy
(Figures 2 and 3). Elemental analyses, however, could not be obtained
because of the very small quantities available. Single-crystal X-ray
structures could be obtained for two of the complexes, providing unambiguous
proof of structure (Table 1). Both structures revealed a Pt atom located exactly or nearly
exactly in the mean plane of a planar corrole ligand. For PtIV[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py), the two axial ligands, m-C6H4CN and pyridine, were found to occupy symmetry-equivalent
sites in the crystal, each with 50% occupancy, and were modeled such
that the atoms of the two six-membered rings were superimposed (Figure 4). Accordingly, the
axial Pt–C/N distances for this structure only represent an
average of the “true” Pt–C and Pt–N distances.
Fortunately, the second structure, PtIV[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) (TPC = triphenylcorrolato), was
found to be fully ordered (Figure 5). The structures exhibit some of the shortest Pt–N
distances known, which for the equatorial nitrogens are 1.955 ±
0.015 Å, reflecting the sterically constrained character of 5d
metallocorroles. The axial Pt–C and Pt–N distances in
the TPC complex are longer, 2.033(7) and 2.216(6) Å, respectively.

All six complexes exhibit slightly split Soret bands
(Table 2 and Figures 6 and 7), which are essentially unaffected by the para substituents
on the meso-aryl groups as well as strong Q bands.
Over a long
series of studies, we have shown that such substituent-insensitive
Soret maxima are indicative of an innocent, nonradical corrole macrocycle,
which is typical of the great majority of stable 4d and 5d metallocorroles,
including MoO,9 RuN,10 OsN,11 TcO,12 ReO,13 and Au14−17 corroles as well as Mo18 and W biscorroles.19 In contrast, the Soret maxima of the PtIV[TpXPC•2–](m/p-C6H4CN)(Ar) were found to redshift dramatically
in response to increasing electron-donating character of the para
substituent X,7 a phenomenon that is also
observed for other noninnocent metallocorroles, such as MnCl,20,21 FeCl,22,23 FeNO,24,25 Fe2(μ-O),26 and Cu corroles.27−35

Cyclic voltammetry measurements were carried
out for the meta-cyanophenyl series PtIV[TpXPC](m-C6H4CN)(py), which
could be obtained in somewhat higher yields than the para series (Figure 8 and Table 2). Given the instability of
the Pt(V) state, the oxidation potentials, which range from 0.56 V
(for X = CH3) to 0.74 V (for X = CF3), may be
safely assigned to corrole-centered oxidation. The low values of the
reduction potentials, which range from −1.53 V (for X = CH3) to −1.37 V (for X = CF3), underscore the
high stability of the PtIVAr–corrole unit toward
reduction. That said, although the electrochemical HOMO-LUMO gap of
2.1 eV is typically indicative of a redox-inactive metal center and
of ligand-centered oxidation and reduction,10−13,16,36 the fact that the reduction is irreversible
suggests concomitant cleavage of the Pt–Ar bond.

of Pt[TpXPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) (X = CF3, H, and CH3) in CH2Cl2 recorded at a scan rate
of 100 mV/s.

Photophysical measurements
were carried out on two of the complexes,
PtIV[TpXPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) for X = CF3 and CH3 (Table 3 and Figures 9 and 10). Both are clearly phosphorescent, which was confirmed by almost
complete quenching of the emission in the presence of oxygen (Figure 9b,d), measurement
of the decay time (Figure 10) and by acquisition of luminescence excitation spectra (Figure 9a,c). The latter
are essentially identical to the absorption spectra; the small deviations
are due to nonlinearities ascribable to strong absorption in the Soret
region (the concentration used was necessary for obtaining high-quality
emission spectra with excitation in the Q-band). The NIR phosphorescence
is rather weak, but the quantum yields are in the same order of magnitude
as those observed for Ir(III) corroles.2 This observation is interesting, considering that Pt(IV) porphyrins,37 in contrast to Pt(II) porphyrins,38−41 have been reported to be nonemissive.42 Weak red fluorescence (not quenchable by oxygen) was also clearly
detected for the two compounds studied. The quantum yields for the
fluorescence were estimated to be about an order of magnitude lower
than those for the phosphorescence. Upconversion with a triplet annihilator,
which proved feasible with OsN corroles,4 was found to be very weak due to the relatively low energy of the
triplet state and the short triplet state decay times.

Conclusions
In what is only the second report on platinum
corroles, we have
described the synthesis of the first set of stable Pt(IV) complexes,
in which the corrole is thought to be an innocent ligand (i.e., without
radical character). These have the general formula PtIV[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py), where X = CF3, H, and CH3. Although the yields are low (typically <5%), the compounds
could be characterized with the standard spectroscopic methods and
in two cases single-crystal X-ray crystallography providing rare insight
into an elusive class of molecules. The structures revealed short
equatorial Pt–N distance of 1.94–1.97 Å, an axial
Pt–C distance of ∼2.03 Å, and an axial Pt–N
distance of ∼2.22 Å. The UV–vis spectra revealed
Soret maxima at ∼430 nm, which are essentially independent
of the meso-aryl para substituents and strong Q bands
with the most intense peak at 595–599 nm. The substituent-independent
Soret maxima are consistent with an innocent PtIV–corrole3– description for the new complexes. The low reduction
potentials (−1.45 ± 0.08 V vs saturated calomel reference
electrode (SCE)) also support a highly stable Pt(IV) ground state
and rule out a corrole•2– description. The
reductions, however, were found to be irreversible, which suggests
that they involve concomitant cleavage of the Pt–aryl bond.
Somewhat to our surprise and unlike Pt(IV) porphyrins, two of the
complexes, PtIV[TpXPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) (X = CF3 and CH3), were found to exhibit room-temperature near-IR phosphorescence
with emission maxima at 813 and 826 nm, respectively. The quantum
yield of ∼0.3% is in the same order of magnitude as those of
six-coordinate Ir(III) corroles.

Experimental Section
Materials
Free-base meso-triarylcorroles
were synthesized according to a literature procedure.43 Platinum(II) chloride was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
and used to synthesize tetranuclear platinum(II) acetate, as described
in the literature.44 Platinum insertion
reactions were carried out in a Biotage microwave reactor using 20
mL of microwave vials. Silica gel 60 (0.04–0.063 mm particle
size, 230–400 mesh, Merck) was used for flash chromatography,
and silica gel 60 preparative thin-layer chromatography (PTLC) plates
(20 cm × 20 cm, 0.5 mm thick, Merck) were used for final purification
of all complexes.

Instrumental Methods
UV–visible–NIR
spectra
were recorded on an HP 8454 spectrophotometer. 1H NMR spectra
were recorded on 400 MHz Bruker AVANCE III HD spectrometer equipped
with a 5 mm BB/1H SmartProbe at 298 K in CDCl3 and referenced to residual CHCl3 at 7.26 ppm. Mass spectra
were recorded on a Thermo Scientific LTQ Orbitrap XL spectrometer
with an Ion-Max electrospray ion source.

Cyclic voltammetry
was carried out at 298 K with an EG&G model 263A potentiostat
having a three-electrode system: a glassy carbon working electrode,
a platinum wire counter electrode, and a saturated calomel reference
electrode (SCE). Anhydrous CH2Cl2 (Aldrich)
was used as solvent and tetrakis(n-butyl)ammonium
perchlorate, recrystallized twice from absolute ethanol and dried
in a desiccator for at least 2 weeks, was used as the supporting electrolyte.
The reference electrode was separated from the bulk solution using
a fritted glass bridge filled with the solvent/supporting-electrolyte
mixture. The electrolyte solution was purged with argon for at least
2 min, and all measurements were carried out under an argon blanket.
All potentials were referenced to the SCE.

Emission and excitation
spectra were acquired on a FluoroLog 3
spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific) equipped with a NIR-sensitive
R2658 photomultiplier (Hamamatsu). Relative quantum yields at room
temperature were estimated using a solution of Pt(II) tetraphenyltetrabenzoporphyrin
in toluene as a reference (Φ = 21%).40 The dye solutions were deoxygenated in a screw-cap cuvette (Hellma,
Mülheim, Germany) by bubbling argon through the solution for
12 min. Phosphorescence decay times were acquired in time domain on
the FluoroLog 3 spectrofluorometer using a 390 nm SpectraLED (Horiba)
as the excitation source.

General Procedure for the Synthesis of Pt[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py), Where X = CF3, H, CH3
To
a 20 mL microwave vial containing PhCN (5 mL) and a magnetic stirring
bar were added a free-base corrole H3[TpXPC] (0.114 mmol) and Pt4(OAc)8·2HOAc
(1 equiv). The vial was sealed and heated for 2 h at 150 °C under
microwave irradiation. Upon completion of the reaction, pyridine (0.5
mL) was added and the contents of the vial were transferred to a round-bottom
flask (50 mL) and evaporated to dryness. The resulting solid was dissolved
in dichloromethane (5 mL) and loaded onto a silica gel column and
eluted with a mixture of dichloromethane and n-hexane
(the exact ratio of which is stated below for each case). All fractions
containing Pt[TpXPC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py), characterized by a Soret λmax between 426 and 430 nm, were collected and evaporated to
dryness. The product thus obtained was separated into the meta and
para regioisomers with PTLC using a dichloromethane/n-hexane mixture as eluent, as indicated below.

Synthesis and
Separation of Pt[TpCF3PC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py)
The
crude reaction product was chromatographed on
a silica gel column with 3:2 dichloromethane/n-hexane
as eluent. The fractions with a UV–vis λmax of 430 nm were collected and evaporated to dryness, resulting in
a combined yield of 3.69 mg (6.6%) for the Pt[TpCF3PC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py) regioisomers. PTLC with 1:1 dichloromethane/n-hexane as eluent was then used to separate the m- and
p-isomers; the top band was identified as Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py) and
the lower band as Pt[TpCF3PC](p-C6H4CN)(py) based on 1H NMR analysis. Dark purple X-ray quality crystals of the meta isomer
were grown by slow evaporation of a dichloromethane/n-hexane solution of the complex over a period of 15 days. Spectroscopic
characterization data for the two isomers are as follows (see also Figures 2 and 3).

The crude reaction
product was initially chromatographed on a silica gel column with
2:1 dichloromethane/n-hexane as eluent. The fractions

Synthesis and Separation
of Pt[TpCH3PC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py)
The crude reaction
product was chromatographed on
a silica gel column with 3:1 dichloromethane/n-hexane
as eluent. The fractions with a λmax of 427 nm were
collected and evaporated to dryness, resulting in combined yield of
4.17 mg (8.0%) for the Pt[TpCH3PC](m/p-C6H4CN)(py) regioisomers.
PTLC with 3:1 dichloromethane/n-hexane as eluent
was then used to separate the isomers; the top band was identified
as Pt[TpCH3PC](p-C6H4CN)(py) and the lower band as Pt[TpCH3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py)
based on 1H NMR analysis.

X-ray Crystallographic
Analyses
X-ray data for Pt[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) and Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py)
were collected on beamline 11.3.1 at the Advanced Light Source, Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory. Each crystal was mounted on a MiTeGen
Kapton loop and placed in a nitrogen cold stream provided by an Oxford
Cryostream 800 Plus low-temperature apparatus on the goniometer head
of a Bruker D8 diffractometer. The diffractometer was equipped with
a PHOTON 100 CMOS detector for Pt[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) and a PHOTONII CPAD detector for Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py), each operating in shutterless mode. Diffraction data
were collected with synchrotron radiation monochromated using silicon
(111) to a wavelength of 0.7293(1) Å for Pt[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) and 0.7749(1) Å for Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py). An approximate full sphere of data was collected
on each crystal using a combination of ϕ and ω scans.
The crystals of Pt[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py) were found to be twinned, the components were separated using
the CELL_NOW program.45 Absorption corrections
were applied with SADABS46 for Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py) and with TWINABS47 for
Pt[TPC](m-C6H4CN)(py). The
structures were solved by intrinsic phasing (SHELXT)48 and refined by full-matrix least squares on F2 (SHELXL-2014)49 using the
ShelXle GUI.50 All non-hydrogen atoms were
refined anisotropically. Hydrogen atoms were geometrically calculated
and refined as riding atoms.

The two axial ligands in Pt[TpCF3PC](m-C6H4CN)(py), pyridine and C6H4CN, were found
to occupy symmetry-equivalent sites within the crystal, each with
50% occupancy, and were modeled such that the atoms of the two six-membered
rings were superimposed. The C and N atoms that coordinate to the
Pt center (C101 and N101) were constrained to have identical x, y, and z coordinates
via the EXYZ command in SHELX and were refined under separate PART
instructions. Each of the remaining five atoms of the aromatic ring
was modeled as common to both orientations with full occupancies,
since attempts to independently model the two rings were unsuccessful.
The CN and H substituents bound to C105 were refined under the same
PART instructions as C101 and N101, respectively. The disordered axial
ligands led to disorder in the unique C6H4CF3 substituent, causing the CF3 group to be positionally
disordered over two symmetry-equivalent sites. The atoms belonging
to this CF3 group were refined with an occupancy of 0.5,
but no attempt was made to model disorder in the aromatic ring of
this substituent. Rotational disorder was also found for the CF3 groups on the other two C6H4CF3 substituents, and each CF3 group was accordingly
modeled over two orientations with complementary occupancies. Equivalent
disordered atoms (e.g., N101/C101) were constrained to have equal Uij values via the EADP command in SHELX. Additional
crystallographic information has been summarized in Table 1, and full details can be found
in the Crystallographic Information File provided as Supporting Information.
