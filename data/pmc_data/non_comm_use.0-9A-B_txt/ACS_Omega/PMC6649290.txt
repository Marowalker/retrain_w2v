The honeycomb-structured
film has advantages such as high wettability
and high surface area. This structure and properties are suitable
for the capacitor electrode. In this study, the electrode structure
is controlled by the synthesis of MnO2 nanoparticles using
the breath figure method. The electrode performance was calculated
by electrochemical measurements. As a result, the capacitance value
was 100.5 F/g at 1 mV s–1, which was improved 2.7
times as compared with that without structure control.

1 Introduction
Energy
storage devices with low cost, high power density, and large
storage capacity are crucially important for realization of low carbon
society. Many types of energy storage devices have been proposed,
examined, and developed for this aim. Among them, a supercapacitor
is one of the promising energy storage devices with respect to its
high power density and long cycle life.1−3 Pseudo-electrochemical
double layer capacitors employing redox active metal oxides such as
RuO2 as anodes received considerable attention over the
last decade because they could achieve high charge densities approaching
those of secondary batteries4,5 owing to the additional
faradic charge.6 For example, Miller et
al. have reported a RuO2-based supercapacitor with a high
capacitance exceeding 1000 F/g.7 However,
wide use of RuO2 devices is difficult because of scarcity
and toxicity of Ru.7

Thus, alternative
electrode materials other than RuO2 are needed for practical
use of supercapacitors. Manganese dioxide
(MnO2) is one of the most promising materials with its
theoretical capacity second to RuO2.8 Mn is an abundant element and environmentally safe.9 In fact, MnO2-based capacitors have
shown excellent cycle stability and storage capacity.10,11 MnO2 is known to exist in several different crystallographic
forms such as α-, β-, γ-, δ-, and ε-types,
achieved by different connections of [MnO6] octahedra.12 Among them, α-MnO2 is most
interesting in terms of its high chemical stability and long cycle
life when used in electrochemical capacitors.13 Some general drawbacks of MnO2 are the low surface area
as it tends to form large crystals and low conductivity, both limiting
the performance of the capacitor.4,5 Application
of MnO2 is therefore hindered due to small Coulombic capacity
in its practical use and large energy loss on charging/discharging
at high rates.14,15 In order to improve the device
performance of MnO2 supercapacitors, we have focused on
both improving the electrical conductivities and increasing the surface
area of electrodes by introducing hierarchically porous surface structures.
In our previous study, the surface of MnO2 particles was
decollated with fullerene nanocrystals.16 Capacitors made from such composites exhibited higher capacitance
than those of original MnO2. The added fullerene nanocrystals
contributed to both improving the conductivity and increasing double
layer capacitance.

In the present study, we have examined the
usefulness of hierarchic
porous structure to be simply achieved by connection of nanosized
MnO2 crystals. A method called “breath figure technique17” has been employed to construct such
a structure.18−20 Successful application of the technique has been
demonstrated in the preparation of porous polymer films. When solutions
of a polymer in solvents nonmiscible with water are cast onto substrates
under humid air, droplets of water are co-deposited. Evaporation of
both the solvent and the water droplet then leaves a highly open honeycomb
structure of the polymer ranging from submicron to micron scale. Because
of the high porosity and surface roughness, such a honeycomb polymer
showed a high water repellency.21,22 The breath figure technique
has further been applied in a construction of hierarchic porous films
composed of inorganic nanoparticles by replacing the polymer solution
with a dispersion of polymer-stabilized inorganic nanoparticles.19 The wall of the honeycomb is then made with
sintered and interconnected inorganic nanocrystals instead of polymer.
If such a structure is made from nanocrystals of MnO2,
the layer should be ideally suited as the electrode for capacitors,
as a large surface area is achieved while assuring a good conductivity
within the well-connected nanoparticles. The large honeycomb pores
should facilitate ion transport at the same time to ensure fast charging/discharging.

We have synthesized α-MnO2 nanoparticles in a
narrow size distribution by the previously established method.23 The surface of the particles was modified with
catechol-containing amphiphilic copolymers24 to help their dispersion in chloroform as a solvent nonmiscible
with water.18,25 The breath figure technique was
then applied to structure a hierarchically porous honeycomb out of
interconnected α-MnO2 nanoparticles. Structural characterizations,
as well as electrode performance in supercapacitors, are discussed.

2 Results & Discussion
The process for the preparation
of α-MnO2 nanoparticles
is graphically summarized in Scheme 1, whereas the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images of the product are shown
in Figure 1. The MnCl2 precursor is slowly hydrolyzed and oxidized with atmospheric
O2 to result in nanosized MnO(OH)2, which is
finally converted to MnO2 by sintering in air. The SEM
image shows formation of round particles in an average diameter of
about 20 nm. The TEM image also confirms the spherical morphology,
without inclusion of particles in other shapes such as rods and cubes.10−13

Figure 2 compares
the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns before and after the sintering.
The one before sintering (Figure 2a) is amorphous showing no characteristic peaks, whereas
the one after sintering at 400 °C (Figure 2b) exhibits diffraction peaks at 2θ
= 28°, 34°, and 36°, which are assigned to α-MnO2 (JCPDS, file no. 44-0141).

(a) before sintering and (b) after sintering.

Surface modification with the polydopamine methacrylamide-γ-polydodecylacrylamide
(PDMA-γ-PDA) copolymer promoted dispersion of the α-MnO2 nanoparticles in chloroform as shown by the set of data,
photographs, TEM images, and dynamic light scattering (DLS) size distributions
in Figures 3, S1 and S2. While the as-synthesized α-MnO2 rapidly precipitates, the one coated with the polymer gave
a homogeneous dispersion stable for a long time. Large aggregates
are formed without the coating, whereas the coated particles are well
separated as recognized from the TEM images. The mean diameter determined
from the DLS measurements also indicates size reduction from 150 to
70 nm upon the polymer coating. The amphiphilic PDMA-γ-PDA polymer
has catechol groups which are able to form hydrogen bonding to the
O atom of MnO2 surface via the two adjacent −OH
groups. Such multiple bonding is known to be stronger than that of
ordinary hydrogen bonding because of the small O–O distance
of about 2 Å (Figure S3).30,31 The coating of MnO2 with the polymer makes the surface
hydrophobic to suppress aggregation and help dispersion in organic
solvents. This way, a homogeneous dispersion of α-MnO2 nanoparticles in hydrophobic solvent, chloroform, could be successfully
prepared (Figure S4).

of (b-1) after coating and (b-2) TEM image; and (c) DLS results show
the size distribution of nanoparticles dispersion (1) before coating
and (2) after coating with amphiphilic copolymer.

While connections of nanosized MnO2 particles
naturally
result in mesopores as the primary porous structure, the secondary
macropores can be fabricated by the breath figure method (Figure S5), so that hierarchically porous architecture
can be made out of a single material.24 Water droplets can be co-deposited with the dispersion of MnO2 in chloroform that is nonmiscible with water. Figure 4 shows the SEM images of thus-prepared
honeycomb layers before and after sintering at 400 °C for 10
min (Figures 4a,b, S6, and S7). The unique large-sized pores created
by the water droplets (some larger than 10 μm diameter) reduce
their size after sintering due to lateral shrinkage of the layer caused
by the removal of the polymer coating and connection of the MnO2 nanoparticles, although cracks are apparently not formed.
From the high-magnification images provided as insets, the individual
particles are not recognized before sintering which become apparent
after removal of the polymer coating by sintering. The interconnected
MnO2 nanoparticles create a mesoporous structure having
a high surface area, essential to achieve a high electrochemical capacitance,32 whereas the macropores made by the breath figure
method are expected to facilitate ion transport needed for high current
charging/discharging.

films composed of α-MnO2 nanoparticles (a) before
and (b) after sintering.

Figure 5 compares
cyclic voltammograms measured at a mesoporous electrode prepared by
simple coating of the MnO2 nanoparticles and the hierarchically
porous electrode by the breath figure method (Figure S8). The increase of faradic current at the anodic
end of the potential scanning can be associated with oxidation of
water. When the capacitive current in the broad potential range is
compared, it is clearly enhanced by introducing the honeycomb structure,
increasing the specific capacitance from 37.0 to 100.5 F g–1. Unfortunately, comparing the capacitance value with previous reports,11,14 our value of capacitance is almost the same. However, there are
advantages to constructing a hierarchical electrode structure using
nanoparticles such as high surface area, and performance has been
further improved by several methods such as coating the conductive
polymer by electrodeposition and composite with graphic carbon by
dip coating to increase the capacity. In fact, the hierarchic porous
structure achieved by our method is made of well-sintered α-MnO2 particles to minimize the infrared (IR) loss, while the large
honeycomb pores can facilitate delivery of ions to the mesopores,
so that a larger portion of the coated MnO2 nanoparticles
can participate in the charging/discharging events than those of the
simply coated layer having only tiny mesopores. Thus, usefulness of
structure control has been well demonstrated to increase the electrode
performance for supercapacitors.

film electrode and (b) α-MnO2 nanoparticles without
structural control which recorded 0
and 0.8 V vs Ag/AgCl in aqueous 1.0 M Na2SO4 at a sweep rate of 1 mV s–1.

3 Conclusions
Synthesis of α-MnO2 nanoparticles, their dispersion
in chloroform by coating with the amphiphilic copolymer, and fabrication
of hierarchically porous honeycomb layers by the breath figure method
have been successfully achieved. The thus-prepared MnO2 layer exhibited a superior electrochemical performance to a mesoporous
MnO2 prepared by simple coating of the same MnO2 particles, increasing the specific capacitance from 37.0 to 100.5
F g–1 as determined from cyclic voltammograms. While
assuring a high surface area by employing nanosized MnO2 particles as building blocks, the large macropores of the honeycomb
structure were found to facilitate ion transport, resulting in the
increase of capacitance in the actual use. The present work thus nicely
demonstrates the usefulness of structure control to improve full usage
of the electrode material in the design of supercapacitors.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Chemicals
Manganese(II)
chloride
tetrahydrate (MnCl2·4H2O, 99.99%) was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich. N,N-Dimethylformamide
(DMF, 99.5%), sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 97.0%), ethanol (EtOH, 99.5%),
and chloroform (CH3Cl, 99.0%) were purchased from Wako.
All chemicals were used without further purifications. The amphiphilic
copolymer, PDMA-γ-PDA, was synthesized from N-(3,4-dihydroxyphenthyl)methacrylamide and N-dodecylacrylamide
by free radical polymerization.18,26−29

4.2 Synthesis of α-MnO2 Nanoparticles
Nanoparticles of α-MnO2 were synthesized according
to the method proposed by Ramarajan et al.23 A precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 450 mg of MnCl2·4H2O in 45 mL of deionized water and stirring
at room temperature for 15 min. After complete dissolution, 150 μL
of DMF was added as a surfactant and a total of 45 mL of 0.05 M NaOH
was dripped very slowly taking 2 h under stirring. Precipitated solid
mass was centrifugally separated at 10 000 rpm and washed four times
with ethanol by applying repeated centrifugation. The product particles
were then dried at 35 °C under vacuum for 12 h. The nanoparticles
were finally sintered at 400 °C under air for 2 h for crystallization
to α-MnO2 film preparation.

4.3 Preparation
of α-MnO2 Dispersion
and Honeycomb Film Structuring by the Breath Figure Technique
Hydrophobic dispersion was prepared by adding α-MnO2 (85 mg) to CH3Cl (1.5 mL). The mixture was ultrasonicated
for 5 min and then a 1 mL of CH3Cl containing 10 mg PDMA-γ-PDA
was added dropwise to promote dispersion of the MnO2 particles.
It was ultrasonicated for another 1 min and was allowed to stand for
1 h to precipitate large aggregates of MnO2. Supernatant
obtained after centrifugal separation at 12 000 rpm containing the
dispersion of the surface modified MnO2 was diluted by
adding 500 μL of CH3Cl, to which another 50 μL
the above PDMA-γ-PDA solution was further added to support cross-linking
of the particles in the honeycomb film.

Fluorine-doped SnO2 (FTO) coated conductive glass (Asahi-DU, 10 Ω/sq) used
as the substrate was cut into 20 × 35 mm. A strip of a masking
tape (Nitto Denko N-300) of 20 mm long and 15 mm wide was pasted perpendicularly
to the FTO glass, leaving 15 mm on one end to regulate the area for
coating as 20 × 15 mm, while the other end of 5 mm wide was left
for making an electrical contact. A cooling stage controlled at 11
°C was placed in a home-made closed chamber connected to a humidifier
(an air pump connected to a gas washer containing deionized water).
When the chamber was closed and humidified air was pumped through,
a temperature of 23 °C and a humidity of 60% were typically read
by the probe put in the chamber. The FTO glass substrate was flat
laid on the stage and a 100 μL of the MnO2 dispersion
was cast onto the substrate. Then, the chamber was closed to allow
condensation of water droplets on the coated wet film for 1 min. The
film was taken out of the chamber to dry the film under air, and then
put in a furnace to sinter the film at 400 °C for 10 min to yield
the honeycomb-structured MnO2. Film preparation according
to this procedure resulted in average quantity of MnO2 coating
as 0.9 mg cm–2.

4.4 Characterization
SEM (JEOL JSM-6700F)
was used to observe the synthesized particle and morphology of the
honeycomb-structured film. TEM (JEOL JSM-2100F) images were obtained
to observe the state of dispersion of MnO2 nanoparticles
by coating with the amphiphilic PDMA-γ-PDA polymer. The crystallinity
of the synthesized particles was checked by powder XRD on a Rigaku
SmartLab employing Cu Kα radiation. The particle size distribution
was measured by DLS employing a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern ZEN3600).
Electrochemical measurements at the honeycomb MnO2 working
electrode were carried out in a conventional three-electrode single
compartment electrochemical cell with a 1.0 M Na2SO4 aqueous solution as the electrolyte and employing an electrochemical
measurement system (Hokuto Denko HSV-110) for record of cyclic voltammetry.
A Pt-wire and an Ag/AgCl electrode were used as the counter and reference
electrodes, respectively.
