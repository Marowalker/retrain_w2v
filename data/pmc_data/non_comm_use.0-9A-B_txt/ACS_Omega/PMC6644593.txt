In
this paper, terahertz time-domain spectroscopy was employed
to study the properties of marine kerogen from Western Canada Basin
at various temperatures. On the basis of terahertz absorption coefficients
of samples, the evolution model of oil and gas generation in kerogen
was established, explained, and verified by IR and principal component
analysis. In addition, the molecular models of kerogen were simulated
by means of the quantum chemistry. Then the vibration characteristics
of functional groups in terahertz band were analyzed, and the reasons
for different absorptions of kerogen at different temperatures were
explained. This study will provide a reference for thermal evolution
kinetics of kerogen, as well as an effective complement to the potential
evaluation of oil and gas resources.

==== Body
1 Introduction
The Western Canada Basin
is a massive sedimentary basin with an
area of 1.4 × 106 km2, including southwestern
Manitoba, southern Saskatchewan, Alberta, northeastern British Columbia,
and southwestern corner of Northwest Territories. The rock formation
is about 6 km thick below the Rocky Mountain, rich in shale and with
a high abundance of organic matter.1 In
sedimentary rock, ∼95% of the organic matter is composed of
kerogen, the key intermediate in the formation of oil and gas.2 Studying the thermal evolution of kerogen will
help to better understand the mechanism of oil generation in kerogen
and provide the basis for further improvement of the modern oil generation
theory.

Various methods have been applied to study kerogen,
such as thermal
analysis, chemical degradation, infrared (IR) and Raman spectroscopy,
gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, and solid-state nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Hu Haiyan3 et al. characterized kerogen by 13C NMR spectroscopy
and obtained the structural parameters of kerogen, revealing the thermal
evolution and hydrocarbon generation of kerogen. By the Fischer assay
experimental approaches, Deng guo Lai4 et
al. found that most of the aliphatic carbons in kerogen generated
oil and gas, and the aromatic carbons were mainly converted into a
coke residue. Our group adopted terahertz time-domain spectroscopy
(THz-TDS) to probe the evolution of kerogen with temperature in a
semiclosed and semiopen system. Terahertz spectrum has been employed
to obtain information of materials by many investigators and efforts
were made to apply the terahertz approach to detect kerogen in this
work.5−12 Terahertz technology is a nondestructive testing technique compared
to other means that are routinely used by organic geochemists. However,
the absorption change caused by the weak motions of molecules plays
an important role in analyzing the evolution of kerogen, which can
be a supplement in the above-mentioned studies. In the electromagnetic
spectrum, some activities correspond to the terahertz range, such
as weak interactions (such as hydrogen bonds) between organic molecules,
slow movement and rotation of macromolecules, skeleton vibration of
macromolecules (configuration bending), dipole rotation, and vibration
transition.13 Therefore, it is of some
significance to study the mechanism of action between the terahertz
wave and kerogens.

In this work, kerogens at different temperatures
were characterized
by THz-TDS, and the evolution model of hydrocarbon generation was
established. Then the relationship between THz absorption and chemical
bond fracture was analyzed by IR. The kerogen functional molecule
was modeled by Gaussian software using the quantum chemistry method,
and motion modes of the molecules in the terahertz range were observed
visually through Gauss View video function. In this way, the weak
vibration and the large skeleton vibration of different functional
groups were identified at different frequencies.

2 Results
and Discussion
Figure 1 shows terahertz
time-domain spectra of samples after terahertz wave passing through
kerogens and the illustrations is frequency-domain spectroscopy. As
shown in Figure 1,
kerogens at different temperatures had different terahertz absorptions.
Therefore, amplitude of terahertz wave was found to be various
after passing through different samples. The terahertz refractive
index of the sample was higher than the refractive index of N2, resulting in different propagation speeds of terahertz waves
through different samples, which caused diverse time delay. In terahertz
frequency-domain spectra obtained by fast Fourier transformation of
time-domain spectra for samples and reference, terahertz radiation
was mainly concentrated in the frequency range of 0.3–1.45
THz. Different kerogen samples corresponded to different frequency-domain
spectra.

Figure 1 Terahertz time-domain spectra of samples (The illustration is frequency-domain
spectroscopy).

Figure 2 shows terahertz
absorption coefficient spectra of the samples. As shown in Figure 2, compared with the
absorption curves of the samples with different temperatures, the
evolution model of kerogen was established (Figure 3). As shown in Figure 3, it can be found that the absorption curves
of the samples at various evolutionary temperatures had different
trends. Absorption coefficients of the samples at 310, 425, and 450
°C reached the maximum at 0.8 THz. As seen from Table 1, at 310, 425, and 450 °C,
carbon–oxygen double bond disappeared or appeared again, showing
that 0.8 THz is the sensitive frequency of carbon–oxygen double
bond cleavage. The maximum absorption varied with frequency at different
temperatures, indicating that the changes are not the same. For example,
the wave number of carbon–carbon double bonds changed at 350
and 400 °C. A large number of carbon–hydrogen bonds appeared
at 350 °C, and the wave number of carbon–hydrogen bonds
decreased obviously at 375 °C.

According to the theory of oil generation,
the hydrocarbon evolution
of organic matter can be divided into five stages.2 As shown in Figure 3, it can be seen that there was a certain relationship between
terahertz optical parameters of kerogen and stages of hydrocarbon
evolution by comparing kerogen absorption curves and evolution temperatures
at different frequencies. At early mature stage (225 °C ≤ T < 300 °C), the functional groups did not change
significantly and terahertz optical constants showed little change.
During the middle mature stage (300 °C ≤ T < 375 °C), methyl, methylene, and oxygen-containing functional
groups were separated from kerogen, producing a large amount of oil
and gas.14 Furthermore, the corresponding
terahertz absorption changed significantly. This stage was the peak
of oil generation of kerogen. During this period, there were peaks
of clay minerals due to the pyrolysis effect of rock, while clay minerals
have an obvious effect on the amount and composition of organic hydrocarbons.15,16 As the simulated temperature increased, the remaining kerogens agglomerates
into large molecules with aromatic nuclei during the late mature stage
of evolution (T ≥ 375° C).17 This stage produced a large number of C–H
bonds (Table 1), mainly
generating methane. The condensation and cleavage of the molecules
increased terahertz absorption coefficients again.

In this study,
principal component analysis (PCA) was used to analyze
the relationship between temperature and absorption coefficient as
well. On the basis of the idea of dimensionality reduction, the multi-index
was transformed into a few comprehensive indexes [i.e., principal
components (PCs)]. PCA is a mathematical method, which reduces the
number of dimensions within the data while retains as much of the
overall variations as possible based on uncorrelated projections.
The calculation of PCA results in several variables called PCs. PCs
are a set of new maximized variables, which are uncorrelated and expressed
as a linear combination of original variables.11 The results showed that the first PC (PC1) accounted for
91.4% of the total and contributed the most to kerogen. The second
PC (PC2) accounted for 4.6%, making the second contribution to kerogen.
As shown in Figure 4, kerogen at different stages can be classified by PC1 and PC2. PC1
and PC2 were related to original variables,18,19 while kerogen at the same maturity stage got together, which was
consistent with the evolution model of kerogen oil and gas generation.

PC2 two-dimensional map calculated by PCA.

In order to further investigate the absorption characteristics
of kerogen molecules, the dielectric functions of the samples were
studied. The optical properties of the matter can be uniquely determined
by the dielectric function, which is related to the microscopic electromagnetic
interaction of the matter.20 When an external
electric field is applied to the sample, the phenomenon will appear.
After removing the electric field, this phenomenon will disappear
and the molecules relax and return to their original state. The time
of relaxation process is called relaxation time (τ), which is
in picosecond and can be detected by the terahertz wave.21 As shown in Figure 5, the real part of the dielectric constant
of samples (ε′) was calculated, ε′(ω)
= n2(ω) – k2(ω), in which n is the refractive
index and k is the extinction coefficient. As the
frequency increased, the real part of dielectric constant showed a
decreasing trend. When the electric field frequency increased, the
intermolecular rotation became more and more difficult because of
the restriction of polymer chain bonds and covalent bonds between
carbon atoms and hydrogen atoms, and the polarization rate does not
change with increasing frequency.14 As
shown in Figure 6,
the imaginary part of dielectric constant (ε″) was calculated,
ε″(ω) = 2nk; they had a large
difference before 0.5 THz, but they became stable after 0.5 THz, which
showed that the dielectric properties of kerogen had significant changes
at low frequency.

Figure 6 Imaginary part of dielectric constants of samples.

Intermolecular collision can cause
transient dipole moment, and
the relaxation process occurs after interaction with the electric
field.22,23 The reason that differences existed in the
dielectric properties of samples with different temperatures was that
the collision probabilities of the sample molecules with different
evolution temperatures were various and that the shorter hydrocarbon
chain was conducive to inducing the dipole moment of a single molecule.24 As the temperature increased, the carbon chains
of kerogen continued to fall off to form hydrocarbons and became shorter
and shorter, which affected the relaxation process and time. Therefore,
the optical parameters of kerogen with different temperatures were
inconsistent.

The interaction between kerogen and terahertz
wave was based on
the change of functional groups.25 In order
to demonstrate the change of functional groups in the terahertz range
during the evolution of kerogen, the function groups of kerogens were
modeled by Gaussian software and the molecular vibrational spectra
were obtained after structure optimization and frequency calculation
in the terahertz range. Studying macromolecular compounds with a small
molecule model was considered as an effective method. The principle
of selecting small molecules from a macromolecular structure was that
compositional elements and chemical bond types should be consistent.26−28 C21H30O, C24H48O, C14H16O, and C11H12O2 were simulated as shown in Figure 7a–d. By Gauss View video function of Gaussian
software, the C21H30O molecule of six vibrational
modes at 9.02, 23.84, 25.77, 28.4, 37.05, and 46.54 cm–1 was observed, and the corresponding frequencies were 0.27, 0.71,
0.77, 0.85, 1.1, and 1.4 THz, respectively. C24H48O was found to have nine vibration modes at 5.72, 11.55, 14.86, 18.73,
25.44, 27.9, 36.67, 39.41, and 46.56 cm–1, corresponding
to frequencies which were 0.17, 0.35, 0.45, 0.56, 0.76, 0.84, 1.1,
1.2, and 1.4 THz. The results showed that the vibrational modes of
aromatic rings and carbon chains had some differences. The aromatic
rings have three kinds of oscillation modes: plane swing, nonplane
swing, and nonplane twist. The carbon chain had two kinds of modes:
nonplane swing and nonplane twist. The inherent frequency of a molecule
was determined by the overall oscillatory modes of the molecule. Resonance
absorption occurred when the terahertz wave interacted with molecules,
which explained the difference of kerogen absorption with different
frequencies. However, the functional groups of the kerogen samples
changed because of the generation of oil and gas, and inherent frequencies
were different; hence, the kerogen samples at different temperatures
had different absorption coefficients.

3 Conclusions
In this paper, THz-TDS was utilized
to study the evolution of kerogen
with different simulated temperatures, and the evolution model was
established. Furthermore, the interaction between kerogen and terahertz
wave was studied by the dielectric function, and the modes of vibration
and rotation of kerogen molecules in the terahertz range were explored
by means of quantum chemistry. The results showed that differences
of kerogen molecules on the absorption of terahertz wave were resulted
from the transient dipole moments induced by collisions between molecules,
as well as the different modes of vibration of kerogen molecules at
different frequencies.

4 Experimental Methods
4.1 Sample Preparation
Kerogen was isolated
from shales in the Western Canada Basin. Conventional chemical isolation
method was used. First, the shale was smashed, and 100 mesh particles
were taken after sieving. Soxhlet isolation was done with chloroform
for 72 h to remove residual soluble organic matter in rocks, the samples
were heated to different temperatures (200–450 °C) in
an aluminum crucible after drying, and the pyrolysis products in different
temperature zones were treated with HCl and HF to remove inorganic
minerals and then washed with distilled water to obtain kerogen particles
of different maturities. In final, the purity of the kerogens was
verified by a thermogravimetric analyzer with a loss on ignition of
more than 90%. After analysis, the type of kerogen was type II. The
kerogens were named after the pyrolysis temperatures.

4.2 Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy
The terahertz instrument
is CIP-TDS. In the THz-TDS system, the terahertz
waves are generated by a photoconductive antenna which is triggered
by a femtosecond laser. Ti–sapphire femtosecond mode-locked
pulsed laser generates femtosecond laser pulses with the center wavelength
of 800 nm, the repetition frequency of 80 MHz, and the pulse width
of 100 fs. Experiments need to be conducted in the N2 environment,
with the humidity below 1%.

4.3 Fourier Transform Infrared
(FTIR) Spectroscopy
The testing instrument is VERTEX 70 +
HYPERION 2000, including
the FTIR spectrometer and IR microscope. The signal-to-noise ratio
of the normal test is higher than 55 000:1, and the signal-to-noise
ratio of the micro test is 7000:1. The wave number accuracy is better
than 0.005 cm–1, and the light transmittance accuracy
is better than 0.07% T. The best space accuracy of
