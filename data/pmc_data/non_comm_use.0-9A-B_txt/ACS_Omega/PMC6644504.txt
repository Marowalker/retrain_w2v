Solid-state
perovskite solar cells have been expeditiously developed
since the past few years. However, there are a number of open questions
and issues related to the perovskite devices, such as their long-term
ambient stability and hysteresis in current density–voltage
curves. We developed highly efficient and hysteresis-less perovskite
devices by changing the frequently used TiO2 mesoscopic
layer with polymer-hybridized multidoped ZnO nanocrystals in a common
n–i–p structure for the first time. The gradual adjustment
of ZnO conduction band position using single- and multidopant atoms
will likely enhance the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 8.26
to 13.54%, with PCEmax = 15.09%. The highest PCEavg of 13.54% was demonstrated by 2 atom % boron and 6 atom % fluorine
co-doped (B, F:ZnO) nanolayers (using optimized film thickness of
160 nm) owing to their highest conductivity, carrier concentration,
optical transmittance, and band-gap energy compared to other doped
films. We also successfully apply a fine polyethylenimine thin layer
on the doped ZnO nanolayers, causing the reduction in work function
and overall demonstrating the enhancement in PCE from ∼10.86%
up to 16.20%. A polymer-mixed electron-transporting layer demonstrates
the remarkable PCEmax of 20.74% by decreasing the trap
sites in the oxide layer that probably reduces the chances of carrier
interfacial recombination originated from traps and thus improves
the device performance. Particularly, we produce these electron-rich
multidoped ZnO nanolayers via electrospray technique, which is highly
suitable for the future development of perovskite solar cells.

1 Introduction
The
intensive interest in perovskite solar cells has led to a very
rapid progress in cell performance compared to any other photovoltaic
technology.1−3 The advances in power conversion efficiency (PCE)
have been achieved by optimizing cell configuration and layer fabrication
processes.4−9 PCE as high as 20.7% has been achieved using a planar structure,
while a PCE of 22.1% has been obtained via a mesoscopic structure.10 For most of the device architectures, a thin
film of TiO2 has been mostly used as an electron-transporting
layer (ETL) in both planar and mesoscopic perovskite cells.11−16 New types of ETLs (e.g., WO3, Zn2SnO4, and SrTiO3) have also been explored to produce efficient
perovskite cells.17−19 However, to develop up-to-date efficient perovskite
solar cells using these mesoscopic ETLs along with thin hole-blocking
layers of the same materials, high-temperature sintering is required.
This severely hinders the fabrication of large flexible devices.20 Thus, in the near future, the development of
perovskite devices at low temperature would be an encouraging way
and movement.

Nanostructures of ZnO are highly suitable alternative
materials
to other mesoscopic ETLs for perovskite devices owing to their suitable
energy levels, ease of fabrication at low temperatures, and relatively
high electron mobility.21−24 Only a handful of studies have evaluated the effect
of ZnO-based ETLs of different morphologies.25,26 ZnO nanorods, for example, offer efficient charge collection compared
to TiO2 nanorods, owing to their more rapid charge-carrying
behavior.27 In addition, doping the ZnO
by substituting the metallic atoms into its lattice not only improves
its conductivity, but also facilitates the shift of the Fermi level
toward conduction band direction, which will eventually enhance the
performance of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), but the efficiency
is not satisfactory yet.28−30 Moreover, the alternation in
the surface morphology of oxide layer will greatly influence the device
performance because the interface between the perovskite and the oxide
layer plays an important role in charge separation and crystal growth.17,25 Reports are also available on the bulk modification and interfacial
treatment of oxide layer to enhance the collection and injection of
charges and also to reduce the carrier recombination at the same time.31−33 However, the efficiency of these liquid-based devices is not comparable
to that of perovskite solar cells, and the main drawbacks of DSSCs
(instability of liquid electrolyte, costly dye and catalyst, etc.)
have not been solved yet. Recently, researchers6,22,34−36 have also presented
a route of surface modification and improving the electron-transport
properties to enhance the performance of perovskite devices by doping
metallic elements (e.g., Al, Yt, Mg, Nb) into the nanostructures of
ZnO and TiO2. However, compared to the advanced TiO2 ETL-based devices, lower device performances were achieved
even in these devices.

Motivated by the desire to evaluate the
synergetic influence of
dopant on the nanostructures surface of oxide layer and to tune the
energy levels to obtain an efficient perovskite solar cell, we introduced
first the substitution of multidopant into the ZnO lattice and studied
their effect on the perovskite device performance. In our previous
reports, we investigated the influence of single and co-dopants (with
optimized dopant amounts) on the performance of transparent electrodes
(transparent conductive oxides) by enhancing the electrical conductivity,
optical transmission, stability, and possibility for future commercialization.37−39 We had found that the additional electrons could be generated using
doping atoms, which will enhance the carrier density, mobility, conductivity,
and surface stability because such findings of multidoped ZnO films
have an excellent technological aspects and would also add to basic
studies.

The use of conjugated polyelectrolytes offers the advantage
of
changing the work function of the oxide layer to boost the cell performance
in an efficient way.40−43 In this method, the surface of oxide layer is finely coated using
a material which physically or chemically adsorbed on it; the surface
transformer is selected in a sense to generate strong surface dipoles
that bring a shift in vacuum level and thus alter the work function
of the oxide ETLs.44 Very recently, polyethylenimine
(PEI) or polyethyleneimine-ethoxylated polymers have been investigated
to modify indium tin oxide (ITO) work function by forming a dipole
layer at the ITO–PEI interface and to yield efficient solar
cells.45 These polymers can easily form
solutions with 2-methoxyethanol or water (known as environmentally
friendly solvents) and can be simply handled in ambient atmosphere.
Moreover, their ease of handling and inexpensive nature make them
well suited for printed electronics with roll-to-roll large-area production.44 The key issue with this method is that the existence
of trap sites in the bulk of the ZnO ETLs still forbid the transport
of electrons caused by the empty spaces between ZnO nanocrystals (NCs).

A different methodology is to form the composite of polymers and
oxide layers (ZnO or TiO2) by mixing them together before
deposition in the developing stage. A simple polymer-mixed composite
single-layer ETL is more functional and easy to process compared to
a complex bilayer film. However, only a few studies have been conducted
where a composite ETL has been investigated rather than a bilayer
ETL (oxide layer coated with polymer) in inverted polymer cells. For
instance, only in polymer solar cells, composites of poly(ethylene
oxide),46 poly(ethylene glycol),47 poly(vinylpyrrolidone),44 and PEI48 with ZnO films have been reported
to construct polymer-mixed ETLs. However, such mixed polymer composite
ETLs have not been investigated yet for perovskite solar cells.

In this work, we have introduced a low-temperature and easy-to-operate
full-solution-processed electrospraying technique for the development
of mesoporous pure ZnO and multidoped ZnO nanocrystals. We constantly
increase the position of conduction of the ZnO ETLs by doping with
diverse combination of metallic and nonmetallic atoms. By changing
the position of oxide’s conduction band and surface morphology,
we are capable of significantly improving the open-circuit voltage
(VOC) to achieve the maximum values of
efficiency reported so far for doped ZnO-based perovskite devices.
Previously, we have studied the transparent electrodes in the form
of 2 atom % boron-doped ZnO (B:ZnO), 2 atom % tantalum-doped ZnO (Ta:ZnO),
2 atom % boron and 6 atom % fluorine co-doped (B, F:ZnO), and 2 atom
% tantalum and 6 atom % nitrogen co-doped (Ta, N:ZnO) thin films.37−39 We have constructed the perovskite solar cells using these thin
films and investigated their effect on the cell performance at optimized
dopant concentrations reported previously. The B:ZnO films with highest
conductivity, carrier concentration, optical transmittance, and band-gap
energy will likely produce a PCEavg of 13.54% and a PCEmax of 15.09% among other doped films. We have substantially
reduced the work functions of these films by coating them with a thin
layer of PEI, which results in remarkable improvements of PCE of 16.2%
in hysteresis-free mesoscopic perovskite solar cells. A remarkable
PCEmax of 20.74% was achieved when a polymer-mixed ZnO
ETL is used. To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is
the first study that employs co-doped semiconducting nanostructured
films in combination with polymer as an ETL to obtain hysteresis-less
and very efficient perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the obtained
PCEmax of 20.74% exceeds the previously reported highest
efficiency for the perovskite solar cells based on ZnO ETLs.49−53

2 Results and Discussion
2.1 General
Scheme for Tuning Nanolayer Properties
and Device Architecture
Figure 1a shows the schematic illustration of low-temperature,
easy-to-operate, and fully solution-processed electrostatic spray
deposited pure ZnO and multidoped ZnO mesoporous ETLs composed of
fine nanocrystals (as shown in the inset of Figure 1a). Highly mesoporous ZnO ETLs could be easily
achieved by providing a constant low heating (150 °C) at the
bottom of the substrate during the entire deposition process. The
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area increased
from 7.3 m2/g for pure ZnO to 27.5 m2/g for
B, F:ZnO ETL. However, these ETLs have numerous traps left in the
bulk of ZnO, and doped ZnO nanocrystals (NCs) lead to electron trapping
due to the voids between ZnO NCs (Figure 1d(i)). Coating a thin layer of conjugated
polyelectrolyte, such as polymer (PEI), on top of the ETL (as illustrated
in Figure 1b) can reduce
the work function of ETL and will also reduce the surface traps, which
enhances electronic pairing of ETL/perovskite layer and thus boost
the device performance (as explained in Figure 1d(ii)). The functionality of these films
was further enhanced by mixing the ZnO solution with PEI and the blended
solution was electrosprayed directly onto the heated substrates, as
illustrated in Figure 1c. The PEI is finely dispersed in the entire film (inset of Figure 1c), which decreased
the surface roughness and trap states for ZnO film, thereby possibly
improving the physical contact and stimulating the strong dipoles
movements between the perovskite absorber layer and ITO conducting
substrate, generating the cells with improved performance (Figure 1d(iii)).

Figure S1 displays the surface nanostructures
of pure ZnO and multidoped ZnO (such as B:ZnO, Ta:ZnO, B, F:ZnO, and
Ta, N:ZnO) mesoscopic ETLs formed by electrospraying at the optimized
dopant concentrations and the process parameters (flow rate, distance
between the nozzle and the substrate, solution concentration, substrate
temperature, and applied voltage as summarized in Table S1) as reported elsewhere.37−39 As the film
morphology is critically influenced by the dopant concentrations and
process parameters. The grain size of the doped ETLs was gradually
reduced as the dopant amount was increased in the precursor solution,
which will eventually affect their optical and electrical characteristics
and hence the device performance.37−39 It was also examined
that the additions of dopant atoms have strongly influence the surface
roughness of ETLs. It was also examined that when dopant atoms were
substituted into pure ZnO films, a substantial reduction in surface
roughness was observed.37−39 The surface modification and
morphology refinement of the oxide ETLs is a better route to refine
the morphology of light harvester and transfer of electrons in the
mesostructured perovskite solar cells. The electrical and optical
properties of the pure ZnO and doped ZnO films at the optimized dopant
concentrations are plotted in Figure 2 and summarized in Table S2. The B, F:ZnO nanolayer demonstrates the lowest resistivity (9.70
× 10–5 Ω cm), highest optical transmittance
(99.8%), maximum carrier concentration (3.41 × 1021 cm–3), and a band-gap energy of 3.42 eV compared
to other pure and doped ZnO films. A side-view scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) image of full cell based on B, F:ZnO nanolayer as an electron-transporting
material is shown in Figure S1f.

2.2 Device Structure and Energy-Level Diagram
The schematic demonstration of the perovskite device architecture
(glass/ITO/ZnO or doped ZnO nanolayers/MAPbI(3–x)Clx/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag)
and the energy-level description of the corresponding materials (measured
by Kelvin probe) are shown in Figure 3a,b, respectively. The incorporation of dopant atoms
into ZnO lattice produced dopant-substituted crystal lattice in ZnO,
allowing ZnO ETLs to have higher values of conduction band, as illustrated
in Figure 3b. It is
important to note that the electronic structure of ZnO can be tuned
using doping, which results in increase of the band gap. The single-doped
(B:ZnO and Ta:ZnO) ZnO nanolayers do not contribute significantly
to the rise of conduction band edge. Therefore, co-doped ZnO nanolayers,
such as Ta, N:ZnO and B, F:ZnO, are also employed to raise the conduction
band prominently, and a significant shift of 0.22 eV is caused by
B, F:ZnO nanolayer compared to pure ZnO. The continuous elevation
of conduction band edge will increase the VOC for the perovskite cell and suppressed the recombination at the
doped ZnO/perovskite interface.26

Figure 3 (a) Illustration
of device architecture with PEI-coated and PEI-mixed
ZnO and doped ZnO nanolayers and (b) energy-level diagram of the corresponding
devices with five various types of pure and doped ZnO nanolayers.
Continuous raising of the conduction band edge using various combinations
of dopants causes a 0.22 eV shift in the conduction band compared
to the pure ZnO films, and also the conduction band edge of B, F:ZnO
nanolayer decreased to 0.38 eV owing to dipole interaction by the
PEI layer.

2.3 Device
Performance of Pure and Doped ZnO Nanolayers
with Optimized Dopant Concentrations
In Figures 4a and S2, we show the J–V plots and external quantum efficiency (EQE) of the perovskite devices
with pure ZnO and doped ZnO nanolayers with film thickness of 160
nm. The photovoltaic parameters, such as open-circuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and power conversion
efficiency (PCE) of the related cells, are outlined in Table 1. The cells with B, F:ZnO nanolayer
show the best JSC of 20.75 mA/cm2, FF of 0.68, VOC of 960 mV, average
PCE (PCEavg) of 13.54%, and maximum PCE (PCEmax) of 15.09%, which is much improved compared to the devices based
on pure ZnO nanolayer with similar film thickness (PCEavg of 8.26% and PCEmax of 9.16%) and also higher than other
doped films as well. Actually, doping of ZnO enhances the electron
density, which results in an increase in JSC and PCE as well.37−39 Moreover, the rise in VOC (from 860 to 960 mV) after doping originated from an increase in
Fermi energy levels and electron density, and reduced recombination
losses, which decreases the restriction to the transfer of electrons.37−39 Furthermore, continuous raising of the conduction band edge using
various combinations of dopants causes a 0.22 eV shift in the conduction
band compared to pure ZnO films, which will eventually improve the VOC and enhance the faster transfer of electrons.49 The devices fabricated with thicker pure ZnO
and doped ZnO nanolayers (240 and 300 nm rather than 160 nm) showed
lower VOC and JSC (in the reverse direction only) (Figure S3), showing that thinner nanolayers are better for highly efficient
devices. The enhanced performance of the nanolayers with small thickness
is attributed to the complete infiltration of the perovskite absorber
into the oxide layer and to the improvement of charge-transfer characteristics.22Figure S2 shows the
EQE spectra of the perovskite devices with pure and doped ZnO nanolayers.
A plateau of over 85% EQE across the visible region is clearly seen,
proposing the full conversion due to the improved absorbance of perovskite
absorber for the devices based on B, F:ZnO nanolayers. The solar cells
exhibit a considerable hysteresis-less behavior when altering the
scan direction, as shown in Figure 4a, and the related photovoltaic parameters are listed
in Table S3. As exhibited in Figure 4b,c, device performance in
terms of JSC, VOC, FF, and PCEavg was enhanced upon the addition of dopants
into ZnO. The devices based on B, F:ZnO nanolayers exhibit the best
performance compared to other nanolayers. The variation in the performances
of 50 different perovskite devices based on pure ZnO and B, F:ZnO
nanolayers is presented in Figure 4d, demonstrating a PCEavg of 8.26 and 13.54%,
respectively.

2.4 Device Performance of Doped ZnO Films with
Unoptimized Dopant Concentrations
We have also constructed
perovskite devices using highly doped ZnO nanolayer to evaluate their
performance with the devices based on optimized dopant concentration.
It was observed that the devices based on highly doped ZnO films have
low device performance (see Figure S4 and Table S4) compared to the optimized ones (as shown in Figure 4a). Actually, at higher dopant
amounts, film morphology gets destroyed, which increases the surface
roughness.37−39 Furthermore, the substitution of heavily doped atoms
into the ZnO sites will result in lower carrier concentration and
less conductive and transparent films,37−39 which will eventually
affect the device performance in terms of low-efficient ones, as can
be seen in Figure S4.

2.5 Device Performance for PEI-Coated Pure and
Doped ZnO Films
We have now spin-coated the best-performing
pure ZnO and B, F:ZnO nanocrystals using a thin layer of PEI, keeping
in mind the strong interaction between nonpolar surface of ZnO and
PEI,45 to achieve a fine coating that reduces
the work function of ZnO further.26 The
schematic representation of the energy-level diagram based on the
PEI-coated B, F:ZfunO nanolayer is shown in Figure 3b. We observe a 0.38 eV shift (measured by
Kelvin probe) in work function between PEI-uncoated B, F:ZnO and PEI-coated
B, F:ZnO nanolayer, caused by PEI coating. These findings also demonstrate
that PEI fine coating reduces the work function of B, F:ZnO ETL from
4.16 to 3.78 eV.

We have also confirmed whether the PEI thin
layer was actually coated onto the ZnO surface or not since it has
a thickness of only 2–3 nm. To prove the successful coverage
of ZnO surface with PEI layer, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
was performed, as exhibited in Figure S5. As presented in Figure S5a, the representative
peak (N 1s), which is collected from the nitrogen element in the PEI
polymer (see Figure 3b), was clearly seen for PEI-coated B, F:ZnO nanolayer and PEI-coated
ITO substrate samples around 400 eV. The presence of boron (B) and
fluorine (F) peaks in Figure S5a confirms
the successful substitution of B and F atoms into the ZnO lattice.
These findings confirm that the PEI layer was essentially coated on
the B, F:ZnO nanolayer surface. Especially, we observe that the positions
of O1s and Zn2p peaks in the B, F:ZnO nanolayer were moved in the
presence of PEI layer (Supporting Information, Figure S5c,d), which shows that the PEI layer definitely disturbs
the ZnO electronic structure. The PEI coating covering the B, F:ZnO
nanolayer surface results in the increase of JSC rise from 20.75 to 21.85 mA/cm2, FF from 68 to
70%, and VOC from 960 to 990 mV, as listed
in Table 2 and exhibited
in Figure S6, demonstrating a PCEavg of 15.14% (PCEmax = 16.20%). Thus, PEI-coated B, F:ZnO
nanolayer produced considerably better devices than uncoated nanolayers
(PCEavg = 13.54%; PCEmax = 15.09%) and this
enhancement is attributed to the reduced series resistance and rapid
electron extraction.45 Furthermore, coating
the surface of pure ZnO nanolayer using PEI polymer will also improve
the device performance, but not much as observed for doped samples.
The enhanced performance of doped films features the outstanding performance
realized by the combined implementation of doping, surface modification
of semiconducting surface, and PEI coating.23 The J–V plots for the best-performing
perovskite devices after PEI coating also showed certainly improved
efficiency, producing PCEmax values of 16.20 and 10.86%
for the devices with B, F:ZnO and pure ZnO nanolayers, respectively
(as plotted in Figure 5a). We have also prepared 50 cells (using PEI-coated B, F:ZnO and
pure ZnO nanolayers) independently under the same experimental conditions.
The histogram of the PCEavg (Figure 5b) exhibits that the cells (based on PEI-coated
B, F:ZnO nanolayer) had an average efficiency of 15.14% and a PCEmax of 16.20%.

average	21.85	990	70	15.14 ± 0.10	16.20	
2.6 Device Performance for PEI-Mixed Pure and
Doped ZnO Films
Earlier, we demonstrated that PEI coating
covering the surface of pure and doped ZnO nanocrystals generated
enhanced device efficiency compared to the only pure ZnO and doped
ZnO ETLs. Next, we have electrosprayed PEI-mixed pure and doped ZnO
nanocrystals to improve the device performance further thanks to the
reduced traps found in the oxide nanocrystals filled by PEI and decreased
surface roughness and reduced work function. Figure S7 displays the surface atomic force microscopy (AFM) monographs
of the pure ZnO, PEI-coated ZnO, and ZnO/PEI composite layers. It
is worth noting that for PEI-coated ETLs, surface roughness reduced
from 6.78 nm for ZnO film to 5.21 nm and further decreased to 3.46
nm for polymer-mixed ZnO nanocrystals, possibly enhancing the physical
contact and prompting robust molecular dipoles between the absorber
layer and ITO substrate, yielding the enhanced PCEs.48 The PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO nanocrystals cause the JSC to increase from 21.85 to 22.75 mA/cm2,
the FF to rise from 70 to 75%, and the VOC to increase from 990 to 1000 mV, as outlined in Table 3 and presented in Figures S8 and 5c, yielding
a PCEavg of 17.06% (PCEmax = 20.74%). Thus,
the PEI-mixed ETLs yielded substantially better devices than PEI-coated
ETL-based devices (PCEavg = 15.14%; PCEmax =
16.2%) and is believed to benefit the devices by reducing the traps
inside the oxide layer and having better physical contact between
the polymer and oxide layer.48 Furthermore,
a single layer existed between the perovskite layer and the PEI-mixed
ZnO composite nanolayer interface; on the other hand, two interfaces
are found between the PEI-coated ZnO bilayer ETL and perovskite layer,
which will reduce the ability of the carrier to transport vertically
due to surface traps. The best-performing cell revealed a PCEmax of 20.74%, the best efficiency ever stated for perovskite
devices with ZnO ETLs. The PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO ETLs commit the improved
absorption of perovskite absorber compared to the ETLs discussed above.
This hypothesis is showed by the ultraviolet–visible absorption
spectra presented in Figure S9 (Supporting
Information). The perovskite layer based on PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO ETLs
exhibits outstanding light absorption, committing the performance
improvements of the perovskite devices. This is also proved by the
EQE results exhibited in Figure S10 (Supporting
Information), which are essentially in accordance with the trend of JSC in the J–V curves, as displayed in Figure 5b. The integrated JSC is 23.1 mA/cm2 (Figure S10, Supporting Information), which is satisfactory since the measured JSC (23.7 mA/cm2) from J–V curves is achieved in the reverse voltage
scanning. In Figure 5d, the bar chart of the averaged PCE in the reverse and forward scanning
directions for 50 separate cells based on PEI-mixed ZnO and B, F:ZnO
nanolayers demonstrates good reproducibility with >85% of cells
producing
PCE > 10.76 and >17.06%, respectively.

current–voltage curves (Figure 5a,c), and the PCEmax (averaged) values calculated
from those curves are in good agreement with that achieved from maximum
power point tracking measurements (i.e., 0.835 V) at 1 sun illumination,
as plotted in Figure 6a. It is also examined that the devices based on PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO
nanolayers have a constant PCEmax of 20.74%, whereas the
PCE of PEI-coated devices (16.2%) deteriorates a little with light
soaking. The statistics of maximum and average PCEs obtained for the
perovskite devices based on various ETLs (discussed in this study)
are summarized in Figure 6b,c. We constantly demonstrate that multidoped nanolayer with
highest conductivity and optical transmittance, high carrier concentration,
and larger band-gap energy caused a maximum shift in the conduction
band, surpassing pure ZnO nanolayers in all schemes and eventually
producing devices with better PCEavg (2–3 points
higher in each case). This highlights the potential benefits of multidopants
on the electrical, optical, and morphological characteristics of electrosprayed
deposited ZnO at low temperature. Improvements in device performance
are further extended by applying conformal coating of PEI on the surface
of ETLs (will reduce the work function further), resulting in highly
efficient cells. The state-of-the-art devices (with PCEmax of 20.74%) are produced using a polymer-mixed oxide nanolayer thanks
to the decrease in the trap sites of the ETLs, which would surely
minimize the chances of trap-assisted carrier interfacial recombination48 and eventually produce hysteresis-free, stable,
and most efficient ZnO-based perovskite solar cells reported to date.
Although the devices based on PEI-mixed nanolayers showed reduced
hysteresis with almost no difference in the forward and backward scans,
cells with lower PCEs presented more hysteresis for other ETL schemes.
Interestingly, hysteresis index26 (used
to evaluate the hysteresis response) varied significantly for the
different ETL schemes (discuss in this study), as plotted in Figure 6d, and can be calculated
from the following equation 1  where Jscan+(VOC/2) is the current density
at VOC/2 for the forward scan and Jscan–(VOC/2) is the current density at VOC/2 for the backward scan. Hysteric devices demonstrate higher
numbers of hysteresis index, whereas the lowest numbers represent
the hysteresis-free devices. Particularly, in our case, the trend
of hysteresis revealed that it is consistently lower for multidoped
ZnO nanolayers with and without PEI coating on their surface and is
further reduced to a minimum number when a polymer-mixed oxide nanolayer
is used. It is important to mention that the decrease of hysteresis
depends mainly on interfacial engineering of the perovskite devices
by surface modification of ETLs surface.26 The lower hysteresis for devices based on multidoped nanolayers
is mainly due to their better electrical, optical, and surface characteristics
and the proven lower work function facilitating electron extraction
and transfer through the ETL.26 A dipole
layer (created on the ETLs surface by coating a thin layer of PEI)
will further reduce the work function, resulting in the elimination
of hysteresis significantly. Remarkably, the perovskite devices are
also almost hysteresis-free by using a polymer-mixed nanolayer by
reducing the traps in the oxide layer, which will definitely minimize
trap-assisted interfacial recombination of carriers. Additionally,
the hysteresis strongly relies on sweep directions of applied bias,
voltage sweep rates, and light soaking.26 The devices based on PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO nanolayer demonstrate nonhysteric
behavior compared to PEI-coated B, F:ZnO nanolayer (Figures S6 and S8), with negligible variation detected in
the JSC when changing the voltage sweep
rate or direction, as presented in Figure S11. The perovskite devices with PEI-coated and PEI-mixed B, F:ZnO nanolayers
further undergo long-term stability test by light soaking in ambient
environment (relative humidity = 40–45%) and storing the devices
at 45 °C for 15 days continuously. In general, the perovskite
solar cells are extremely susceptible to moisture and eventually rapidly
deteriorate in humid environment because of their ionic nature.49 The devices based on PEI-mixed nanolayers yielded
marginally more stable data in terms of photovoltaic parameters (VOC, JSC, FF, and
PCEavg) compared to devices based on PEI-coated nanolayers
(decreased by only ∼6–8%) over a 15 day period (Figures S12 and S13, Supporting Information).
Thus, the newly proposed polymer-mixed ETLs serve as a key addition
and a scalable technique toward industrialization of perovskite solar
cells.

3 Conclusions
In summary, an atmospheric pressure-based electrospray method is
utilized for the formation of electron-rich multidoped ZnO nanolayers
as ETLs for high-efficiency perovskite solar cells. The position of
conduction band edge is continuously raised using various combinations
of dopants, which causes a 0.22 eV shift in the conduction band compared
to pure ZnO films, which will eventually improve the VOC, suppress the recombination, and enhance the faster
transfer of electrons. The B, F:ZnO nanolayer with highest conductivity
and optical transmittance, high carrier density, and larger band-gap
energy and also benefited by the maximum shift in the conduction band
demonstrates the highest PCEavg of 13.54% and PCEmax of 15.09%, which are much higher than those of pure ZnO film-based
devices. Further improvements in the performance by reducing the work
function of the oxide layer is achieved by coating the nanolayer surface
with a thin layer of PEI, which results in remarkable highly efficient
and hysteresis-free devices with a PCEmax of 16.20%. Eventually,
a polymer-mixed ETL demonstrates a remarkable PCEmax of
20.74% by decreasing the bulk traps inside the oxide layer, which
probably reduces the chances of trap-assisted surface recombination
of charges and, subsequently, improves the device performance. The
current work has notably confirmed the optimization of voltage by
adjusting the energetic structure of the charge-removing material
together with the perovskite absorber, which will be one of the best
reasonable approaches to boost the device efficiency.

4 Experimental Section
4.1 Electrosprayed Deposition
of Pure and Multidoped
ZnO Mesoscopic Nanolayers
Pure and doped ZnO (such as B:ZnO,
Ta:ZnO, B, F:ZnO, and Ta, N:ZnO) mesoscopic nanolayers were coated
onto the surface of ZnO-blocking layer (deposited on indium tin oxide
(ITO) substrates) using atmospheric pressure-based electrospraying
method, as reported previously.37−39 Precursors such as zinc acetate
dihydrate Zn(O2CCH3)2(H2O)2, boric acid (B(OH)3), tantalum (v) chloride
(TaCl5), ammonium fluoride (NH4F), and ammonium
acetate (C2H3O2NH4) were
used as a source of zinc, boron, tantalum, fluorine, and nitrogen,
respectively. The applied high voltages, precursor solution flow rates,
and nozzle-to-substrate distances were maintained at 5.6 kV, 0.003
mL/min, and 4.0 cm, respectively. The precursor solution was sprayed
for 1 h, while the hot plate temperature was retained at 150 °C
(Table S1), and finally, the nanolayers
were annealed at 410 °C in air atmosphere for 1 h. To synthesize
the composite ETLs, the ZnO precursor was mixed using a fixed amount
of PEI (7 wt %) and continuously stirred for 12 h, and the resultant
solution was electrosprayed using the same conditions mentioned above.

4.2 Fabrication of Cells Using Pure and Doped
ZnO Mesoscopic Nanolayers
First, a dense ZnO-blocking layer
was spin-coated onto well-cleaned ITO substrates, followed by sintering
at 500 °C for 30 min.22 After that,
mesoporous pure and multidoped ZnO nanolayers were formed by electrospraying
method, as explained above. A thin layer of PEI was formed over the
surface of ZnO ETLs by spin-coating a PEI solution (prepared in deionized
water with a concentration of 0.01 wt %) at 4500 rpm for 2 min and
subsequent annealing at 150 °C for 5 min. After deposition, the
perovskite absorber layer was formed over the surface of ZnO ETLs
via the one-step spin-coating route, as explained below. The CH3NH3PbI(3–x)Clx solution (CH3NH3I/PbCl2 = 3:1, in N,N-dimethylformamide)
was deposited by spin-coating at 2500 rpm for 30 s and subsequent
drying at 95 °C for 1 h. Afterward, 30 μL of a hole-transport
material was dropped on the substrate and spin-coated at 3000 rpm
for 30 s. Finally, 80 nm thick silver as a top electrode layer was
formed by thermal evaporation method.

4.3 Characterization
The plane-view surface
images of ZnO ETLs and cross-sectional view of complete devices were
obtained using a scanning electron microscope (JSM-7600F, JEOL). The
surface roughness was obtained by atomic force microscopy (AFM, SPA
400). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was conducted to confirm
the elemental composition of ETLs. The optical transmittance of the
ETLs was measured using a UV–visible spectrometer (UV-3101PC).
Electrical resistivity data were collected using four-point probe
equipment (CMT-SR1000N). Hall effect measurement instrument (HMS-3000)
was used to obtain the Hall mobility and carrier concentration data
for various ETLs. The Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) gas
adsorption measurement route was used to measure the surface area
of the powders using Quantochrome NOVA 1000 (Boynton Beach, FL). The
current density vs voltage (J–V) plots were collected using a Keithley digital source meter by adjusting
the intensity to 1 sun (100 mW/cm2). Both the reverse and
forward scans were obtained at a rate of 10 mV/s with a delay time
of 5 s. The active area of 0.25 cm2 was set using a metal
mask aperture.
