In recent years, metal–organic frameworks (MOFs)
have been
wildly studied as heterogeneous catalysts due to their diversity of
structures and outstanding physical and chemical properties. Meanwhile,
MOFs have also been regarded as promising templates for the synthesis
of conductive and electrochemically active catalysts. However, in
most of the studies, high-temperature annealing is needed to transform
nonconductive or low-conductive MOFs to conductive materials for electrocatalyis,
during which the unique structures and intrinsic active sites in MOFs
can be easily destroyed. Therefore, in recent years, different strategies
have been developed for improving the catalytic performances of MOF-based
composites for electrochemical reactions with no need of post-treatment.
This mini-review highlights the recent advances on MOF-based structures
with improved conductivities and electrochemical activities for the
application in electrocatalysis. Overall, the advanced MOF-based electrocatalysts
include the highly conductive and electrochemically active pristine
MOFs, MOFs combined with conductive substrates, and MOFs hybridized
with active materials. Finally, we propose the direction for future
works on MOF-based electrocatalysts.

Introduction
With the booming consumption of traditional
fossil energy and increasingly
serious environmental pollution, exploiting more efficient, clean,
and sustainable energy conversion and storage systems is necessarily
imminent. Hydrogen (H2), with high gravimetric energy density,
zero contaminant, and renewability, has been regarded as one of the
most appealing candidates for the next-generation energy carrier.
Electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which gets rid
of hydrocarbons as the source of hydrogen, is a promising and environmentally
friendly way for hydrogen production.1 However,
the sluggish kinetics of the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction
(ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) that arose from its proton-coupled
multielectron transfer seriously hinder their practical application.
Additionally, the most efficient eletrocatalysts are all precious
metal materials such as Pt and Ru, which are expensive, terrestrial
scarce, and easily dissolved during the electrochemical processes.2 Therefore, it is necessary to develop stable
and cheap alternatives or to reduce the usage of noble-metal-based
electrocatalysts.

Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), also
called porous coordination
polymers (PCPs), are considered to be one class of the most promising
candidates for heterocatalysis due to their high specific surface
area, regular channels, and abundant metal active sites. In addition,
their designable and adjustable channel structure, channel size, and
channel environment make MOFs the ideal templates for coated active
guest molecules with desired functions.3 MOF-based materials can be defined as pristine MOFs, MOF composites,
and MOF-derived materials. Due to the low conductivity and instability
in acidic or alkaline media, most pristine MOFs and MOF composites
cannot be used directly as electrocatalysts.4−6 Normally, MOFs
have been regarded as promising templates for the synthesis of metals,
metal compounds, and carbon-based porous materials after postcalcination
treatment, which generally show high catalytic performances for water
splitting and ORR.2 However, in the reported
strategies, the intrinsic active sites in MOFs may be lost during
the calcination treatment at high temperatures, and the ordered structure
may also be destroyed completely.

For the application of MOF-based
structures in electrocatalysts,
the determination of catalytically active sites and the catalytic
mechanisms is crucially important. The MOF is an extended coordination
network through metal ions connecting to each other via organic linker
molecules.5 As a result, for pristine MOFs,
metal centers or ligands are currently considered to be the active
sites for catalytic reactions. The catalytically active species can
be easily introduced in the metal nodes or organic ligands, such as
the incorporation of active metal sites with nitrogen-containing ligands
(e.g., porphyrin- and bipyridine-based ligands) or the functionalizaiton
of ligands with electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups.7,8 In addition, the well-defined porous structures of pristine MOFs
offer templates for the introduction of additional active species
with controllable size, morphology, component, and location.7,9 Meanwhile, the synergistic effects among the functional units would
further enhance the catalytic properties of the MOF-based catalysts.10 In addition to the active sites, the excellent
electrocatalytic activities of MOF-based structures can also be due
to their following aspects. The good permeability of MOF channels
can result in rapid mass transport during electrochemical reactions.
The substrate specificity of the catalytic sites improves the selectivity
of the electrochemical response. These features render MOFs a class
of ideal candidates for electrocatalysis.9,11

To improve the electrocatalytic activities of MOFs, three main
strategies have been proposed: preparing conductive or electrochemically
active MOFs, MOFs supported on conductive substrates, and MOFs hybridized
with active materials. In the following sections, we summarize briefly
the development of MOF-based composites for electrocatalysis, including
hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), oxygen reduction reaction (ORR),
and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) (Figure 1). It should be pointed out that, in the
past years, there have been several excellent review papers dedicated
to the MOF-derived materials, such as carbon, metal/carbon, and metal
oxide materials for electrocatalysis.2,12 In this mini-review,
we focus on the design and synthesis of pristine MOFs and their composites,
and their direct application in electrocatalysis.9,13 We
hope this review will inspire the related researchers with more interests
and new ideas for future studies on MOF-based electrocatalysts.

of various fabrication strategies for MOF-based
catalysts to enhance the conductivity and electrochemical catalytic
activities of MOF composites.

Pristine Metal–Organic Frameworks
The first
successful demonstration on the use of pristine MOFs
as electrocatalysts for ORR was the wildly used Cu(II)-based MOF (Cu-bipy-BTC,
bipy = 2,2′-bipyridine, BTC = 1,3,5-tricarboxylate), which
exhibited a high and stable catalytic activity (Eonset ≈ −0.1 V vs Ag/AgCl) with almost 4e– reduction of O2.14 However, the low conductivities of pristine MOFs largely limit their
catalytic performances. For electrocatalysts, increasing the conductivities
of MOFs is an effective but difficult strategy. A conductive pristine
MOF was first reported in 2009 by Takaishi et al. which showed a conductivity
of 6 × 10–4 S/cm at 300 K.15 Over the next decade, several conductive pristine MOFs
were developed. Among the reported conductive MOFs in the early stage,
the 2D graphene-like Ni3(HITP)2 (HITP = 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexaiminotriphenylene)
MOF was used as a well-defined, tunable oxygen reduction electrocatalyst
with an onset potential of 0.82 V (with j = −50
μA/cm2) in alkaline solution, as shown in Figure 2A–C.16 However, its ORR catalytic performance is still
too low for real application.

Introducing redox or catalytic active sites in
MOFs is an effective
method to enhance the electrocatalytic performances of MOFs. The active
sites may contain organic ligands, metal nodes, and redox-active metal
complexes. The organic ligands with π–π* bonds
or extension of the conjugated systems can be potentially used for
the construction of electrochemically active MOFs, such as the derivatives
of benzene, pyridine, imidazole, and thiophene. Incorporation of these
organic ligands with redox metal ions is conducive to preparing electrocatalytically
active MOFs. For example, Wang et al. synthesized a cobalt-containing
zeolitic imidazolate framework (Co-ZIF-9) as an OER electrocatalyst
by assembling redox cobalt centers with benzimidazolate linkers. The
fabricated Co-ZIF-9 showed effective OER catalytic activity in a wide
pH range.18 In another work, Gong et al.
prepared two novel Co(II) coordination polymers based on 1,4-bis(3-pyridylaminomethyl)benzene
with coordination geometries analogous to those of most active ruthenium-based
OER catalysts.19 The two complexes exhibited
efficient OER electrocatalytic activities with lowered overpotentials
and enhanced current densities. However, the structures of these MOFs
may collapse during the electrochemical oxidation–reduction
processes.

Polyoxometalates (POMs), containing a large abundance
of O moieties
in the backbone, have been studied as hopeful electrocatalysts for
HER. Meanwhile, the redox activity of POMs could further affect the
catalytic process. Using POMs as metal nodes, the as-prepared MOFs
generally possess the advantages of a 3D framework, large channels,
high surface area, large number of O moieties, and higher stability.
For example, Qin et al. presented a synthetic strategy to tailor two
new POMOFs (NENU-500 and NENU-501) using ε-Keggin polymolybdate
units as the nodes and benzene tribenzoate as the linkers (Figure 2D,E).17 The NENU-500 catalyst exhibited efficient HER
property with an overpotential of 237 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and a Tafel slope of 96 mV/dec in acidic solution, which
are comparable to other excellent non-noble metal electrocatalysts
(Figure 2F). In addition,
the NENU-500 showed fast electrode kinetics (Rct: 28 Ω) and excellent stability. The superior HER performance
of NENU-500 was attributed to the rigid, stable open-pore network
and the good redox properties of the POMs. This study paves a way
to exploit high-porosity and stable POM-based MOFs for the application
in novel HER electrocatalysts.

Metal complexes are another class
of stable and active species,
which are made from stable ligands and active metal ions. Owing to
the stereospecificity and different electron atmosphere of metal ions
in the complexes, metal complexes generally have enhanced redox selectivity
and catalytic capacity. In addition, metal complexes can effectively
retain the excellent properties of the ligands. Metalloporphyrins,
a class of typical metal complexes, which retain the excellent electrical
conductivity and stability of porphyrin ligands, offer a versatile
platform for the design of electrocatalytic materials. Meanwhile,
they generally exhibit high catalytic activities to catalyze a wide
array of substrates under mild conditions. For instance, the Fe(III)
porphyrins were found to be highly efficient molecular catalysts for
ORR, which are structurally related to hemoproteins and exhibit strong
interaction with O2 molecules. The robust PCN-223-Fe is
constructed from Zr6 oxo clusters and Fe(III) porphyrin
linkers. As an ORR electrocatalyst, PCN-223-Fe showed a large catalytic
current under cathodic potentials and achieved high H2O/H2O2 selectivity with the number of transferred electrons
approaching 4.20

In recent years,
bimetallic and multimetallic MOFs, especially
Fe-, Co-, and Ni-based MOFs, have been widely used as excellent electrocatalytic
materials due to the synergy effects among metal ions. In addition,
theoretical computations and experiments demonstrated that high valent
3p or transition metal cations can effectively strengthen the electrostatic
interactions between the metal nodes and carboxylic groups, thus improving
the stability of MOFs. Compared with the monometallic MOFs, the multimetallic
MOFs have been proved to have enhanced electrical conductivities and
OER catalytic performances.21,22 For example, the NiFe-MOF
arrays synthesized by Zhao et al. showed an enhanced electrical conductivity
(1 ± 0.2 × 10–3 S/m) and exhibited a lower
OER overpotential for 10 mA/cm2 than Ni-MOF (240 mV vs
56 mV).22 Zhou’s group synthesized
a kind of very stable bimetal–organic framework of Fe2M-BPTC (M = Co, Ni, and Zn, H3BPTC = biphenyl-3,4,5-tricarboxylic
acid), which has a much lower OER overpotential for 10 mA/cm2 and a faster charge transfer rate than that of Fe3-BPTC.21 We also fabricated two kinds of FeNi-MOFs with
excellent OER performance and stability.23,24 Li and coworkers prepared a series of Fe/Ni-based trimetallic MOFs
(Fe/Ni/Co(Mn)-MIL-53) via a simple solvothermal process, and the MOFs
exhibited high intrinsic OER electrocatalytic activity and stability.25 The optimized Fe/Ni2.4/Co0.4-MIL-53 MOF showed excellent OER catalytic performance with an overpotential
of 236 mV at 20 mA/cm2, better than those
of other proportions of trimetallic MOFs. The high OER catalytic performance
can be attributed to its unique structure and porosity, as well as
the synergy effect of the mixed metals. Unfortunately, the multimetallic
MOFs are complicated, and the catalytic mechanism is still not clear.
Therefore, more studies are needed in this field.

On the other
hand, decreasing the size of the MOF particles to
nanoscale or preparing ultrathin MOF nanosheets (NSs) can expose most
of the active metal sites to the reactants, thus improving the electrocatalytic
properties of MOFs. Recently, Tang et al. prepared ultrathin NiCo
bimetallic MOFs nanosheets (NiCo-UMOFNs) with abundant coordinatively
unsaturated metal sites as promising electrocatalysts for the OER
in alkaline conditions, as shown in Figure 3A–C.26 The
obtained NiCo-UMOFNs with thickness around 3 nm on a glassy carbon
electrode exhibited higher OER electrocatalytic activity with a more
negative onset potential of 1.42 V, a lower overpotential of 250 mV
at 10 mA/cm2, and a smaller Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec than
those of the bulk NiCo-MOFs and the monometallic Ni- or Co-UMOFNs.
The enhanced electrocatalytic properties of the NiCo-UMOFNs can be
ascribed to the ultrathin nanosheet structure for facile mass transport
and fast electron transfer, the rich available coordinatively unsaturated
metal sites with high catalytic activity, and the synergistic interaction
between Co and Ni ions. Wang et al. synthesized various bimetal–MOF
nanosheet (BMNSs) arrays on different conductive substrates by in
situ transformation of the presynthesized layered double hydroxide
(LDH) NS arrays, as shown in Figure 3D.27 The obtained ultrathin
NiCo-BDC BMNSs exhibit excellent catalytic activity and durability
toward OER with overpotential of only 230 mV at 10 mA/cm2 and Tafel slope of 42 mV/dec in 1 M KOH (Figure 3E–G).

MOF-Conductive Material Composites
A simple and efficient
strategy to improve the conductivity of
MOFs is to hybridize MOFs with secondary highly conductive supports,
like graphene, conductive polymers, carbon nanotubes (CNTs), and so
on. Graphene and graphene oxide (GO) have been used widely as substrates
for immobilizing and/or hybridizing MOFs due to their high electrical
conductivity, high specific surface area, and very efficient charge
transfer. There are two hybrid ways between graphene and MOFs: graphene
just as a support or graphene as an integral component of the framework.
The former is a simple and widely used method. However, although this
approach can improve the electronic conductivity of MOFs at a macroscopic
level, the local charge transport in MOFs is still limited by the
pore aperture-defined size-exclusion effects.28 To resolve such a problem, Jahan et al. inserted GO into the copper
MOF as an integral component, in which GO acts as both struts to link
MOF nodes and a good electron transfer mediator, as shown in Figure 4A.28 The as-prepared GO-MOFs showed good performance as a trifunctional
catalyst (HER, OER, and ORR) with smaller overpotentials, higher current
densities, and better stability in acid media compared to pure MOFs
(Figure 4B). The remarkable
electrocatalytic properties and stability of the GO-MOF composites
can be ascribed to the special porous scaffold structure, improved
conductivity, and synergistic effects between GO and MOF. This study
not only confirms that the incorporation of GO into the MOF is an
efficient strategy to enhance the stability and electrocatalytic performance
of MOFs but also offers a new path to design and synthesize nonprecious
metal catalysts for energy conversion. Later, in a work reported by
Jin and co-workers, CNTs were used as an integral component and hybridized
with Co-MOF acting as struts to link MOF nodes.20 In the fabricated Co-MOF@CNTs, CNTs can not only effectively
improve the conductivity and the stability of the composite under
harsh oxidative environment but also enhance the bifunctional electrocatalytic
performance due to the synergistic catalysis of active centers Co(II),
organic ligands, and CNTs (Figure 4C–F).29 The Co-MOF@CNTs
(5 wt %) exhibit high OER and ORR catalytic activities comparable
to RuO2 and 20 wt % Pt/C catalysts, and the stability
is comparable to most of the reported excellent cobalt-based catalysts.
Hybridizing MOFs with conductive polymers is also an effective method
to increase the conductivity of MOFs. There are the following kinds
of MOF–polymer composites: polymer polymerized inside the pores
of MOFs, MOFs grown inside or on the surface of a polymer, MOFs cross-linked
with polymers through the organic ligands, etc. Such proposed catalyst
systems based on conductive polymers and MOFs have potential electrocatalysis
applications, though few systems have been reported.2

Nowadays, loading MOFs on conductive substrates
such as nickel
foam (NF), carbon cloth, and glass substrates coated with tin-doped
indium oxide, by solvothermal, electrochemical, or direct deposition
methods, is another widely used strategy to enhance the conductivity
and electrocatalytic performances of MOFs. For example, the OER catalytic
performance of Fe/Ni2.4/Co0.4-MIL-53 can be
further enhanced by direct growth on porous NF with high conductivity.25 When the ultrathin CoNi-MOF nanosheets are loaded
on copper foam, the overpotential of OER at 10 mA/cm2 decreases
from 250 mV to 189 mV.26

MOF-Active Species Composites
Although efforts have
been made to hybridize MOFs or their composites
with conductive CNTs and GO as electrocatalysts, their performances
are not very satisfactory. To develop efficient MOF-based electrocatalysts,
loading active species into MOF channels has attracted great interest,
especially metal and metal oxide (sulfide, phosphide, or nitride)
nanoparticles (NPs) with excellent electrochemical catalytic activities.
In such composites, MOFs not only act as support and/or template to
control the shape and size of NPs but also offer immobilization, protection,
and selectivity to improve the stability of NPs. On the other hand,
the confined NPs generally show excellent electrocatalytic activities
and meanwhile can improve the conductivity of the composites. Recently,
we successfully encapsulated small Pd nanoclusters with diameter of
2–3 nm into the channel of MOF-74 (Pd@MOF-74).3 Without high-temperature treatment, the prepared Pd@MOF-74
was directly used as a bifunctional electrocatalyst for HER and ORR.
To develop efficient MOF-based ORR electrocatalysts, Cho et al. loaded
nanosized copper sulfide into the pores of Cu-BTC (nano-CuS(x wt %)@Cu-BTC), and the composite has low surface resistivity
and high ORR catalytic activity, as shown in Figure 5A,B.30,31 The ORR performance
of nano-CuS(x wt %)@Cu-BTC is closely dependent on
the conductivity and porosity of the material, which can be adjusted
by using different amounts of nano-CuS. With the amount of nano-CuS
increasing, the electrical conductivity increases, but porosity decreases.
All the synthesized nano-CuS(x wt %)@Cu-BTC samples
demonstrated significantly higher electrocatalytic ORR activities
compared to Cu-BTC and nano-CuS(99 wt %). The optimal CuS (28
wt %)@Cu-BTC catalyst showed an onset potential of 0.91 V vs RHE,
quasi-four-electron transfer pathway, and a kinetic current density
of 11.3 mA/cm2 at 0.55 V vs RHE.

Depositing active materials on the surface of MOFs
is also an efficient
strategy to prepare MOFs with high electrocatalytic activities. For
example, although Hod et al. failed to coat uniform Ni–S film
on the surface of Zr-MOF, the Ni–S electrodeposited at the
bottom of the NU-1000 rods also showed enhanced electrocatalytic HER
performance than the films with only NU-1000 or Ni–S, as shown
in Figure 5C–E.32 The MOFs can not only facilitate the exposure
of the Ni–S surface but also modify the local environment of
the active Ni–S catalyst. He et al. prepared a bifunctional
electrocatalyst by coating various CoIII and CoII contents onto the surface of MIL-101(Cr) with oxidative or reductive
treatment during the impregnation.33,34 The electrocatalytic
activities of the Co/MIL-101(Cr) composites are closely dependent
on the contents of CoIII and CoII on the surface.
A higher content of CoIII is favorable to adsorb O on the
surface of electrocatalyst, thus improving the OER activity. On the
contrary, increasing the content of CoII would be more
preferential to absorb O2 on the surface of the electrocatalyst,
thus improving the ORR activity accordingly. With the CoIII/CoII ratio of ∼0.89, the Co/MIL-101(Cr) catalyst
exhibits the highest overall bifunctional OER and ORR activities with
ΔE value of ∼1.16 V.

Conclusions and Outlook
This mini-review highlights
the latest developed strategies for
the fabrication of MOFs and MOF composites for the application in
electrocatalysis, by taking advantage of their unique structures and
excellent physical and chemical properties. It is well-known that
pristine MOFs and MOF composites generally have low electric conductivity
and are unstable in strongly acidic and alkaline solutions, which
are the disadvantages of MOFs for their application in the field of
electrocatalysis. Therefore, it is very important to explore stable
and electrochemically active MOFs. To this end, several strategies
have been proposed in recent years to synthesize functional MOFs:(1) Highly conductive pristine MOFs with
large surface area and abundant metal active sites have been developed.
The conductivity of these MOFs is close to that of graphite, and meanwhile
the coordinated redox centers or catalytic actively organic ligands
and metal nodes can effectively enhance the electrocatalytic properties
of MOFs. However, it is still a great challenge to design novel pristine
MOFs with ideal electrocatalytic performances for real applications.

(2) By reducing the size of
MOFs to nanoscale
or constructing ultrathin nanostructures, more metal centers can be
exposed and available to the reactants, thus significantly improving
the electrochemical activity of MOFs.

(3) Hybridizing MOFs with highly conductive
materials is a facile, efficient method to develop highly conductive
MOF-based composites for electrocatalysis. The conductive materials
can be used as support to grow MOFs or can be encapsulated into the
channels of MOFs as an integral component of MOFs. Such a strategy
paves a way to exploit highly conductive and stable MOF composites
for the application in electrocatalysis.

(4) MOFs combined with active materials
are helpful to stabilize the active species and improve the conductivity
and electrocatalytic activity of the composites. The advantage of
this method is that MOFs can be used to hybridize various dimensional
electrocatalytically active materials, including nanoparticles (0
D), nanotubes (1 D), films (2 D), and 3 D scaffold materials.



In summary, although there are still problems with MOFs
and MOF-based
composites in electrocatalytic application, their unique structures
and excellent properties make them promising electrocatalysts. Exploiting
more effective methods to design and fabricate novel MOFs and MOF-based
composites with excellent electrocatalytic activity and stability
will be crucial for their practical application in electrochemical
fields.
