We
report the application of a nonvolatile ionic gel as a soft,
conductive interface for electrotactile stimulation. Materials characterization
reveals that, compared to a conventional ionic hydrogel, a glycerol-containing
ionic gel does not dry out in air, has better adhesion to skin, and
exhibits a similar impedance spectrum in the range of physiological
frequencies. Moreover, psychophysical experiments reveal that the
nonvolatile gel also exhibits a wider window of comfortable electrotactile
stimulation. Finally, a simple pixelated device is fabricated to demonstrate
spatial resolution of the haptic signal.

==== Body
Introduction
The skin is the body’s
largest organ.1 It is equipped with a variety
of sensing functionalities
with which electronic devices can be interfaced to transmit information
to the brain. The tactile sense thus provides a natural route for
augmenting human–machine interactions. Electrotactile stimulation
is one way for information to be communicated through the skin—in
the form of a locally resolved tingling sensation.2 Conventional electrotactile devices use metallic conductors
to couple capacitively with ions in cutaneous tissue, activate nerve
afferents, and manifest as a sensation of touch. In this report, we
introduce a new concept: the use of a nonvolatile, ionically conductive
gel as a soft interface between the rigid electronic circuitry of
machines and the natural ionic circuitry of humans (Figure 1).

the concept of an ionotactile device
in a monopolar stimulation configuration. A soft and deformable ionic
conductor is used to interface a metallic electrode and human skin.

The rapidly advancing field of
stretchable electronics is changing
the way devices are designed—especially those meant to interface
with humans.3,4 Architectures for electrotactile
devices have evolved accordingly. Originally designed using conventional
electronic materials, electrotactile devices were restricted to rigid
surfaces.2 Such devices were explored for
programmable braille and displays for the visually impaired.5 More recently, advances in fabrication methods
have enabled the development of conformable devices that use geometrically
patterned electronic conductors on the surface of elastomers to improve
the interface for electrotactile stimulation.6,7 Such
devices make use of materials that are intrinsically rigid and thus
require to be patterned into thin serpentine structures that can withstand
strain and conform to the skin.

Ionic hydrogels have concurrently
emerged as promising conductors
for a variety of sensing and actuation applications because of their
optical transparency, mechanical softness, biocompatibility, and capacity
to self-heal.8−10 This unique combination of properties has enabled
the development of several novel applications such as transparent
loudspeakers,11 wearable sensors,12−14 underwater microphones,15 and electroluminescent
devices.16,17 These materials can also be three-dimensionally
(3D) printed18,19 and chemically bonded to diverse
surfaces20,21 enabling  cheap, rapid, and precise
manufacturing of robust devices. Such creative demonstrations have
inspired us to consider this class of materials as potentially useful
for providing electrotactile stimulation as part of a soft haptic
device.

Results and Discussion
As a first demonstration, we
used a standard poly(acrylamide) (PAAm)
hydrogel containing an aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl, 2.74 M) solution.
PAAm has a modulus commensurate with that of biological tissue (∼10
kPa), it is  biocompatible, and its polymerization chemistry
is compatible with 3D-printing technology.18,19 A function generator was used to pass a square wave alternating
current through the hydrogel into the index finger of a subject. Upon
contacting the hydrogel with an electrically grounded finger in a
monopolar configuration,22 a mild tingling
sensation was perceived. As the force applied by the finger was increased,
the sensation grew stronger.

Evaporation of water from the ionic
hydrogel is a particularly
important obstacle in this application because the device geometry
requires the hydrogel to be exposed to air, and thus encapsulation
is not an option. Ionic liquids23 and highly
hydratable salts such as lithium chloride24 have been proposed as strategies to mitigate drying; however, these
liquids are acutely toxic and thus cannot be used in place of salt
water for a device designed to come in contact with skin. To overcome
this constraint, we replaced the salt water with a solution of glycerol
containing 0.7 M NaCl. Glycerol is a biocompatible, low vapor pressure
fluid (TB = 290 °C) that is capable
of dissolving ions, albeit at lower concentrations than can water.
Replacement of the water was achieved by simply soaking a hydrated
hydrogel in the glycerol solution overnight. This process led to an
observable shrinkage of the gel; a ∼60% reduction in volume
was measured using calipers. Mass loss experiments, shown in Figure 2a, revealed that
the replacement of water with the glycerol solution resulted in a
conductive gel that was stable in air. The water rapidly evaporated
from the aqueous hydrogel under ambient conditions with a mass decay
time of approximately 10 h, while the glycerol gel absorbed some moisture
from the air to increase its mass slightly before reaching equilibrium.
Due to the hydroscopic nature of glycerol, it can be expected that
fluctuations in the relative humidity of the environment will lead
to minor changes in the equilibrium concentration of water in the
glycerol gel.

glycerol gel in air. Insets show photographs of gels before and after
experiments. (b) Indentation and pull-off curves obtained using the
cylindrical stainless steel punch shown in the inset. (c) Electrochemical
impedance spectra obtained using the parallel-plate capacitor geometry
shown in the inset.

In handling the two materials,
we observed that the glycerol gel
adhered to the finger more strongly than the hydrogel did. Such adhesive
properties are desirable for maintaining a stable interface with the
user’s skin during use of a device. To compare the adhesive
and mechanical properties of these two materials, we performed mechanical
indentation experiments on rectangular slabs using a stainless steel
cylindrical punch. As shown in Figure 2b, we found that the glycerol gel exhibited both a
stiffer response to indentation, as well as a significantly stronger
pull-off force. The elastic modulus was extracted from these curves
using an appropriate model25 to correct
for the finite thickness of the hydrogel sample (see Supporting Information, section 1). We found that the aqueous
ionic hydrogel had a compressive elastic modulus of 27 kPa, whereas
the glycerol gel had a higher value of 80 kPa. This increase in stiffness
was consistent with the observed shrinkage of the gel upon replacing
water with glycerol. Moreover, the pull-off force for the glycerol
gel was an order of magnitude larger than that of the hydrogel, in
agreement with our qualitative observation of improved adhesion with
the skin.

It was expected that the replacement of water with
glycerol would
increase the electrical impedance due to a lower concentration of
ions and higher viscosity. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
was used to characterize the electrical response of the two materials.
Gold electrodes, sputtered onto flexible poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) films, were used as electrodes in a parallel-plate capacitor
geometry (1 cm × 1 cm × 0.2 cm). Figure 2c shows the measured impedance spectrum.
The glycerol gel exhibited a slightly higher impedance over the frequency
range relevant for electrotactile stimulation (1–1000 Hz);
however, order-of-magnitude differences only occured at frequencies
over 1000 Hz, suggesting that these two materials should behave comparably
in ionotactile devices. A more detailed analysis of the impedance
data using equivalent circuit modeling is provided in section 2 of
the Supporting Information; this analysis
revealed that the series resistance of the glycerol gel was approximately
an order of magnitude greater than that of the hydrogel.

To
determine sensation threshold curves, a simple finger stimulator
device was fabricated using a mold-casting process described in the Supporting Information, section 4. Ecoflex 00-30
was used as the housing material (Figure 3a), and the ionic gel was addressed using
a film of PET containing a film of sputtered gold. We note here that
over the course of our electrical stimulation experiments, we did
not observe any changes in the appearance or electrical properties
of the device, indicating that no irreversible electrochemical reactions
occurred at the electrode interface. Magnets embedded within the Ecoflex
were used to attach the device to the user’s finger. We tested
the device performance using simple psychophysical experiments on
a pool of four subjects. Experiments were performed using the "method
of adjustment", where subjects manually adjusted the voltage
until
they perceived a sensation, corresponding to the lower bound for tactile
stimulation. Once a lower bound was determined, subjects increased
the voltage until they felt like the sensation would no longer be
considered comfortable to determine an upper bound. A wide range of
frequencies were tested to construct the sensation curves shown in Figure 3b,c.

(a) Image of device worn on
the index finger. Sensation curves showing the source voltage required
for stimulation for a range of frequencies for (b) glycerol and (c)
water. Error bars show the standard deviation between four subjects.

In agreement with our impedance
measurements, we found that the
glycerol gel exhibited comparable performance to the hydrogel when
incorporated into the device. For both materials, subjects observed
that below 10 Hz, individual pulsations were discernible, whereas
above 10 Hz, only a continuous tingling sensation was perceived. Such
experiments are inherently subjective; therefore, the observed variance
across subjects was not surprising. Interestingly, we found that in
the range of 1–100 Hz, the glycerol gel had a larger window
of comfortable stimulation. For both materials, we constructed a voltage–frequency
curve that corresponds to a “sweet spot” for comfortable
stimulation that would be perceptible to all users. This was obtained
by simply adding the standard deviation to the average of the lower
bound for stimulation.

To demonstrate spatial discrimination,
a pixelated device was fabricated
(Figure 4). The electrodes
were designed such that the middle pixel was a common ground, whereas
the upper and lower pixels applied the stimulating voltage, corresponding
to a bipolar electrode configuration.26 Films of Mylar (aluminum-coated PET films) were used to electrically
address the pixels. With this design, we found that the two stimulating
pixels could be distinguished by the user; this experiment demonstrated
that spatial resolution was possible. We also found that the threshold
voltage for sensation was significantly higher: approximately 80 V
at 50 Hz. We expect that the use of 3D-printing technology to pattern
the electrodes into a concentric design comprising an inner disk and
an outer ring6 would facilitate more localized
tactile sensations at a lower stimulating voltage. Finally, it is
important to note that humans naturally integrate visual and haptic
signals.27 Therefore, a wider range of
tactile sensations could be accessible when such a device is paired
with visual stimuli.

Conclusions
We have developed a nonvolatile, transparent,
ion-conducting gel
to demonstrate a materials innovation in haptic technology: an ionotactile
device. This device enables an improved route for human–machine
interaction and has potential to be integrated with emerging technologies
such as virtual and augmented reality. We found that the use of a
saline glycerol PAAm gel was superior to a conventional ionic hydrogel
because of its stability in air, improved adhesion with the user,
and a larger window for comfortable electrical stimulation in the
range of 1–100 Hz. One potential extension of this technology
would be to create a multimodal device that is capable of simultaneously
sensing mechanical deformations12 and responding
by sending a haptic signal to the user. This multimodal functionality,
in conjunction with tissue-like mechanical properties,  makes
the ionic gel a particularly attractive material for robot-assisted
telesurgery applications.28

Experimental
Methods
Synthesis
The ionic hydrogels were synthesized following
a procedure described previously.1 Sodium
chloride, acrylamide (AAm), N,N-methylenebisacrylamide
(MBAA), ammonium persulfate (AP), and N,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamine
(TEMED) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received.
A solution of NaCl (2.74 M), AAm (2.2 M), MBAA (0.06 wt %), and AP
(0.17 wt %) (with respect to the weight of AAm) in deionized water
was prepared. The solution was subsequently degassed in a Schlenk
flask by three evacuate/refill cycles. TEMED (0.25 wt % with respect
to AAm monomer) was injected into the flask, and the solution was
quickly poured into a mold for curing. The mold was fabricated using
a glass Petri dish and a pour-casted/plasma-treated (5 mm thick) poly(dimethysiloxane)
slab:Sylgard-184, 20:1 base to curing agent with a 4 × 4″
square cutout. The prepolymer solution was covered with a glass slide
and then exposed to ultraviolet light using a nail polish curing station
for 20 min. The gels were then immersed in an aqueous 2.74 M NaCl
solution for 24 h and finally rinsed three times with fresh saline
solution to remove unreacted monomer and catalyst. Replacement of
water with glycerol was achieved by rinsing the ionic hydrogel with
deionized water and then immersing it in a 0.7 M NaCl in glycerol
solution for 24 h. Before use, all gels were patted dry with paper
towels and cut into the desired geometries using a razor blade.

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy
Impedance measurements
were conducted over the range of 1–10 000 Hz using a
Solartron 1260 impedance analyzer with a dc bias of 0 V and an applied
ac voltage of 10 mV. Gold films sputtered onto PET (60 nm) were used
as the blocking electrodes in a parallel plate capacitor geometry
(1 cm × 1 cm × 0.2 cm). Equivalent circuit modeling was
performed with ZView software.

Sensation Experiments
Electrotactile sensation experiments
were performed using a Siglent SDG 2042X function generator. A total
of four subjects were tested. These subjects were authors on this
work, and informed consent was obtained. The subject’s hand
was electrically grounded using 3M Red Dot Foam electrodes. Subjects
were instructed to start at 2 V and gradually increase the voltage
in increments of 0.2 V until
they perceived a sensation. Once the sensation threshold had been
determined, subjects were instructed to continue increasing the voltage
at the same rate until they felt the sensation would become uncomfortable
if increased any further. Subjects were asked to describe the sensation
for each frequency tested.
