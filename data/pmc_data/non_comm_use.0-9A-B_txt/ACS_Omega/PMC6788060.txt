The incorporation of phosphonate
ligands into the cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes can not only tune their electronic and optical
properties but also provide the possibility of anchoring these molecules
on the semiconductor surfaces for further applications. Herein, we
report the first examples of mononuclear cyclometallated iridium(III)
complexes incorporating phosphonate ligands, namely, [Ir(ppy)2(HL1)]·0.5H2O (1),
[Ir(ppy)2(HL2)]·0.5H2O (2), [Ir(dfppy)2(HL1)] (3), and [Ir(dfppy)2(HL2)]·3.5H2O (4) (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine,
H2L1 = 2-pyridylphosphonic acid, H2L2 = 2-quinolinephosphonic acid). Luminescent spectra
are studied both in solution and in the solid state, and significantly
red-shifted broad emission bands are observed in complexes 2 and 4. The experimental and density functional theory
(DFT) time-dependent-DFT calculation results indicate that the expansion
of the aromatic conjugation length in the ancillary phosphonate ligands
decreases the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy levels of
the systems, originating from the triplet state associated with the
ancillary ligand such as 3MLCT, 3LC, and 3LLCT charge-transfer transitions.

Introduction
The phosphorescent
iridium(III) complexes are promising d-block
chromophores because of their high quantum efficiency and tunable
emission wavelength.1,2 The highly efficient emission
originates from the strong spin–orbit coupling of the IrIII ion, which leads to efficient intersystem crossing of the
singlet to the triplet excited state. Cyclometalated iridium(III)
complexes have received particular attentions because of their relatively
short triplet excited-state lifetimes, high quantum yields, flexibility
in color tuning, and thermal stability3 and have been widely explored as triplet emitters in organic light-emitting
diode devices, chemosensors, photoredox catalysts, and bioimaging.4−8 Recently, a cyclometalated iridium(III) complex was grafted to indium
tin oxide and titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductors and
served as photosensitizer (chromophore) in dye-sensitized photoelectrochemical
cells,9,10 similar to the Ru–polypyridyl complexes.
Noting that the phosphonate ligands (RPO3H2),
which show strong coordination capabilities toward metal ions,11−13 were frequently introduced to the Ru complexes to anchor the chromophores
strongly on the metal oxide surfaces,14,15 cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes incorporating phosphonate ligands remain almost
unexplored. The only examples, as far as we are aware, are LnIr6 clusters containing 2-pyridylphosphonate as bridging ligand,
which shows magnetic and optical bifunctions.16 It is thus necessary to synthesize cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes
containing uncoordinated or partially coordinated phosphonate ligands
and understand their electronic and phosphorescent properties for
future device applications.

Generally, the emissions of cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes
are assigned to the mixed metal to ligand charge transfer (MLCT) and
the π–π* transition of ligands. Both the cyclometalating
and the ancillary ligands can pose significant influences on the highest
occupied molecular orbital–lowest unoccupied molecular orbital
(HOMO–LUMO) gap and hence tune the electronic and optical properties
of the complexes.17,18 Noting that picolinate was frequently
utilized as the ancillary ligand to adjust the HOMO–LUMO gap
of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes,19−22 herein we use two related phosphonate
ligands, namely, 2-pyridylphosphonic acid (H2L1) and 2-quinolinephosphonic acid (H2L2). Four
new complexes are obtained successfully with formulae [Ir(ppy)2(HL1)]·0.5H2O (1),
[Ir(ppy)2(HL2)]·0.5H2O (2), [Ir(dfppy)2(HL1)] (3), and [Ir(dfppy)2(HL2)]·3.5H2O (4) (ppy = 2-phenylpyridine, dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine)
(Scheme 1), which provide
the first examples of mononuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes
incorporating phosphonate ligands. Their optical and electrochemical
properties are studied in detail. Theoretical calculations are also
performed to illustrate the experimental results.

Experimental Section
Materials and Measurements
All chemicals
and solvents
were of reagent grade and used as purchased. 2-Pyridylphosphonic acid
(2-C5H4NPO3H2, H2L1)23,24 and 2-quinolinephosphonic acid
(2-C9H6NPO3H2, H2L2)25 were prepared according
to the literature procedure. The chloride-bridged dimeric iridium
complexes [Ir(ppy)2(μ-Cl)]2 and [Ir(dfppy)2(μ-Cl)]2 were synthesized according to the
Noyama route by refluxing IrCl3·3H2O with
2.2 equiv of 2-phenylpyridine or 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine in
a 3:1 mixture of 2-ethoxyethanol and water.26

Elemental analyses for C, N, and H were determined with a
PerkinElmer 240C elemental analyzer. Infrared spectra were measured
as KBr pellets on a VECTOR 22 spectrometer in the range of 400–4000
cm–1. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed
on a Mettler-Toledo TGA/differential scanning calorimetry STARe thermal
analyzer in the range of 25–600 °C under a nitrogen flow
at a heating rate of 10 °C/min. Electrospray ionization mass
spectra (ESI-MS) were recorded on a LCQTM MSn ESI mass spectrometer.
The 1H and 31P NMR spectra were recorded at
room temperature with a Bruker Advance III 400 spectrometer. The UV–vis
spectra were recorded on a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 UV–vis spectrometer.
The fluorescence spectra were measured using a PerkinElmer LS 55 fluorescence
spectrometer. Time-resolved fluorescence and quantum yield measurements
were carried out on a Fluorolog TCSPC spectrofluorometer (Horiba Scientific).

Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was carried out with a CHI 760C electrochemical
workstation (CH Instruments, Shanghai Chenhua Co.) with a conventional
three-electrode cell at room temperature. The cell was equipped with
a glassy carbon working electrode, a Pt counter electrode, and a nonaqueous
electrode (Ag/AgNO3). n-Bu4NPF6, 0.1 M, was employed as a supporting electrolyte.
Ferrocene was used as an external standard. All sample solutions in
the cell were purged with high-purity nitrogen for at least 10 min
prior to experiments and a nitrogen environment was then kept over
solutions in the cell to protect the solution from oxygen.

Synthesis

H2L1 (0.35
g, 2.2 mmol) was dissolved in 10 mL of CH2Cl2 containing triethylamine (0.36 g, 3.6 mmol) and then a solution
of [Ir(ppy)2(μ-Cl)]2 (1.07 g, 1 mmol)
in 200 mL of CH2Cl2 was added. The resulted
solution was allowed for stirring at room temperature for 24 h. The
yellow precipitate was isolated, washed with a small amount of water
and CH2Cl2, and dried in air. Yield: 76%. Elemental

Computational Details
Molecular geometries of all the
complexes studied were optimized using B3LYP functional of density
functional theory (DFT). The 6-31+G(d) basis set was used for nonmetal
elements. LANL2DZ effective core potential was used for Ir transition
metal. Frequency calculations at the same level of theory were also
performed to identify all the stationary points as minima. At the
same computational level, the time-dependent-DFT (TD-DFT) calculations
were carried out on the basis of the optimized ground-state geometry.
Typically, the excitation energies of the lowest 3 triplet and 3 singlet
states were predicted. Multiwfn28 was employed
to analyze the charge transfer between fragments of the excited states.
All the calculations were performed with Gaussian 09 packages.29

Results and Discussion
Synthesis and Crystal Structures
Compounds 1–4 were obtained in
the solution following a
similar procedure, confirmed by both elemental analyses and ESI-MS
(Figure S1). Single-crystal structural
analyses were performed only for compounds 1·C4H10O2 and 3. The other
compounds appeared as powder or polycrystalline materials.

Compound 1·C4H10O2 crystallizes
in the monoclinic system with a P21/c space group. As shown in Figure 1a,b, the structure consists of two ppy fragments
as cyclometalated ligands, one HL1 as an ancillary ligand
and a 2-ethoxyethanol molecule as the solvent molecule. The iridium
center is six coordinated with a distorted octahedral geometry (Figure 1a). The ppy ligands
exhibit cis-C–C and trans-N–N chelate configuration, an arrangement that is identical
to that of the chloro-bridged dimer complex [Ir(ppy)2(μ-Cl)]2 and many [Ir(C∧N)2(LX)] complexes.
2-Pyridylphosphonate serves as a chelating ligand by using its pyridyl
nitrogen (N1) and one phosphonate oxygen (O1) atoms. The Ir–C
bond lengths [1.987(6), 2.006(5) Å] are close to the reported
values for the dimeric and mononuclear complexes containing the Ir(ppy)2 fragments. The Ir–N bond length for N from 2-pyridylphosphonate
is longer than those for N or C from the cyclometalating ligands because
of the trans effect of the C donor in the C∧N ligands.
The C16–Ir1–N2, C27–Ir1–N3, and N1–Ir1–O1
angles all deviate from 90°, which support a distorted octahedral
coordination geometry around the IrIII ion. Moderately
strong hydrogen bonds are found between the molecules through the
phosphonate oxygen atoms [O2···O3A: 2.546(5) Å],
forming a supramolecular dimer (Figure 1b). The solvent molecules help stabilize the crystal
lattice via hydrogen bonding interactions [O4···O2:
2.771(11) Å]. Intermolecular interactions are observed between
adjacent dimers (Figure S4a): (i) π–π
overlap for parallel 2-phenylpyridine rings with the centroid–centroid
distance between the two pyridine rings of 3.608 Å, (ii) C–H···π
interaction between carbon atom at 4-position of pyridine ring from
cyclometalating ligand and pyridine ring from phosphonate ligand.
Thus, a supramolecular chain structure is constructed.

interactions between two adjacent
building units in compounds 1·C4H10O2. (c) Building unit of 3. (d) Hydrogen-bond
interactions between two adjacent building units in 3.

Compound 3 crystallizes
in monoclinic system, space
group C2/c. The molecular structure is quite similar
to that of 1·C4H10O2 except that the dfppy ligands replace ppy in the latter and no lattice
solvent molecule is present. The Ir–C, Ir–N, and Ir–O
bond lengths become 1.975(6)–1.985(5), 2.039(4)–2.153(4),
and 2.169(4) Å, respectively (Figure 1c), all slightly shorter than those in compound 1·C4H10O2. Intermolecular
hydrogen bonds are again found through the phosphonate oxygen atoms
[O2···O3A: 2.506(6) Å] forming a supramolecular
dimer (Figure 1d).
Weak intermolecular slipped π–π stacking exists
between neighboring dimers via 2,4-difluorophenyl rings with the distance
of 4.504 Å (Figure S4b).

and complexes 1–4 in CH3CN are shown in Figures S7 and S8. The
complexes show strong absorption bands in the range of 230–300
nm, which are assigned to the ligand-centered (LC) π–π*
electronic transitions of the cyclometalated ligand and the ancillary
phosphonate ligand. The bands are located in the same region of absorption
spectra for the free ligands of ppy, dfppy, and H2L.1,2 The complexes also show absorption bands with lower extinction in
the range 300–500 nm, which are ascribed to the singlet and
triplet metal-to-ligand charge transfer (1MLCT and 3MLCT) states and ligand-centered 3LC transitions,
which are not seen in the absorption spectra of free ligands.

a Measured in CH3CN solution
at a concentration of 5 × 10–5 mol/L.

The luminescence spectra of compounds 1–4 were measured in CH3CN
solution (5 × 10–5 M, prepurged with N2 for 10 min) and solid
state (in air) at room temperature. In solution, compound 1 shows yellow light emission peaking at 506 nm and a shoulder at
ca. 533 nm. The profile shows hypsochromic shift of less than 5 nm
compared with the analogous heteroleptic Ir complex with 2-pyridylcarboxylate
(pic) ancillary ligand, Ir(ppy)2(pic).30,31 Significant red-shift is observed for compound 2, which
shows a broad emission band centered at 594 nm and a small peak at
503 nm with the intensity reduced by about 10 times compared with
that of 1. Similar phenomenon is observed for 3 and 4 containing fluorine-substituted ppy ligands.
The emission peaks are at 476 and 496 nm for complex 3 and at 474 (very weak) and 568 nm for complex 4. The
electron-withdrawing effect of the fluorine atom is also evident,
as shown by blue-shifts of the emission spectra of 3–4 compared to those of 1–2.

For cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes, it is well-recognized
that the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) primarily localizes
on the phenyl part of cyclometalated ligands and the iridium(III)
ion and the LUMO mainly distributes on pyridine part of the cyclometalated
ligand and the ancillary ligands.17 Thus,
the remarkable red-shift observed for complexes 2 and 4 can be ascribed to the expansion of the aromatic conjugation
length of the phosphonate ligand H2L2, which
decreases the LUMO energy level. Moreover, the emission peaks for 2 and 4 are significantly broadened, indicating
that the emission in these complexes could originate from the triplet
state associated with the ancillary ligand such as 3MLCT, 3LC, and 3LLCT (ligand-to-ligand charge transfer)
transitions.32 This is also supported by
the TD-DFT calculations as discussed below.

Notably, the emission
quantum yields of 1 (Φ
= 46%) and 3 (Φ = 58%) are much higher than those
of 2 (Φ = 9%) and 4 (Φ = 2%),
but lower than that of Ir(dfppy)2(pic) (Φ = 95%).33 Decay measurements in acetonitrile solution
reveal that the excited state lifetimes of compounds 1–4 fall in the range of 0.56–0.97 μs
(Figure S9), indicating the triplet nature
of the excited state.30

Emission
spectra of 1–4 were also
studied in the solid state, as shown in Figure 2b and Table 3. The peak wavelengths for 1 (498, 524
nm) and 3 (496, 522 nm) are quite similar. While for
complexes 2 and 4, which contain quinolinephosphonate
ligand, broad red-shifted emission peaks are observed. These peaks
are even broader in the solid state than their counterparts in acetonitrile
solution, which could be due to the excimers arising from the intermolecular
π–π interactions.27 Compared
with those in the solution; however, the quantum yields of complexes 1 and 2 in the solid state are significantly
reduced and the lifetimes are elongated (Table 3). The weak intermolecular interactions could
pose nontrivial influences on stabilizing the excited state, which
results in long-lived phosphorescence in these complexes.34

Electrochemical Properties
To obtain the HOMO–LUMO
gaps, the electrochemical properties of compounds 1–4 in CH3CN solutions were studied by cyclic voltammetry
(CV) using ferrocene as the internal standard in the potential ranging
from 0 to 1.8 V. As shown in Table 4 and Figure 3, compounds 1–4 show reversible
oxidation waves in the region of 0.6–1.7 V, which can be attributed
to the metal-centered Ir(III)/Ir(IV) oxidation, in accordance with
the reported cyclometallated Ir(III) systems. The oxidation potentials
(Eox vs Fc/Fc+) were 1.083, 1.095, 1.413,
and 1.432 V for compounds 1–4, respectively.
Their HOMO energy levels estimated from the oxidation potentials follow
the sequence 1 (−5.43 eV) > 2 (−5.44
eV) > 3 (−5.76 eV) > 4 (−5.78
eV). The results indicate that the fluoride substitution on the cyclometalating
ligands and the expansion of the aromatic conjugation length of the
ancillary phosphonate ligand decrease the HOMO energy level. Unfortunately,
we were not able to observe the reduction peaks for these compounds
within the potential window (−2.0 to 0 V); hence, the LUMO
energy levels cannot be estimated through the CV measurements.

b The HOMO energy levels were calculated
using the equation EHOMO (eV) = −(Eox – EFc/Fc+ + 4.8), where EFc/Fc+ is 0.451 V.

c Ebandgap energies were determined from
the absorption edge of the complexes.

d The LUMO energy levels were calculated
using the equation ELUMO (eV) = EHOMO + Ebandgap.

The HOMO–LUMO gap can
be obtained from the UV–vis
absorbance spectra using the equation Eg (eV) = hc/λonset, where Eg is the gap, λonset is the
lowest absorbance position, h is 6.626 × 10–34 J·s, and c is 3 × 1017 nm/s. The obtained Eg values
follow the sequence 3 (2.67 eV) > 4 (2.64
eV) > 1 (2.52 eV) > 2 (2.50 eV). Obviously,
the gaps of complexes 3 and 4 are larger
than those of 1–2, which is in accordance
with the fact that electron-withdrawing F on the
phenyl group of ppy decreases the HOMO energy level and hence increasing
the HOMO–LUMO gaps. Further, the gaps of complexes containing
quinolone-phosphonate ligands (2, 4) are
smaller than those of the corresponding ones containing pyridine groups
(1, 3), confirming that the expansion of
aromatic conjugation length of the ancillary ligand decreases the
HOMO–LUMO gap. As already mentioned, the ancillary ligand mainly
contribute to the LUMO energy levels. Based on the experimental EHOMO and Eg values,
the ELUMO can be estimated, as given in Table 4.

Theoretical
Calculations
The frontier molecular orbitals
of compounds 1–4 were computed using
B3LYP functional, as shown in Figure 4 and Table S2. For all the studied systems, Figure 4 displays similar
population picture of HOMO, which was mainly composed of 40–44%
d orbital of Ir metal and 53–55% π-orbital of ligands.
Theoretical calculations of energy levels are qualitatively consistent
with our experimental results. The order of calculated HOMO energy
level was 1 > 2 > 3 > 4, in agreement with the experimental value obtained by electrochemical
method. However, there are some differences in the distribution of
LUMO. The LUMO orbitals are mainly concentrated on the ring metal
ligand for compounds 1 and 3 but on the
phosphonate ligands for the others. It is hence not surprising that
the compounds with similar phosphonate ligands have quite similar
LUMO energy levels with the difference of only 0.08–0.09 eV.
The introduction of the electron-withdrawing substituent F group in
ring metal ligand reduced the HOMO energy level. The increasing conjugation
length also caused the decrease of the LUMO energy level. The modulation
of frontier molecular orbitals, especially the LUMO ones, provides
a feasible strategy for rational design and synthesis of metal Ir
compounds based on organophosphate ligands. By modifying the ring
metal ligands and organic phosphonate ligands, the HOMO and LUMO energy
levels can be changed accordingly. To explain the broad red-shifted
emission peaks observed in complexes 2 and 4, we also performed the TD-DFT calculations. As shown in Table S3, Figures S16, and S17, the lowest triplet
state T1 have substantial amount of mixing
transition character of 3MLCT, 3LC, and 3LLCT. However, compared with other compounds, only compound 2 has the charge transfer between ligand ppy and ancillary
ligand H2L2.

complex 1–4, the energy (eV) were
calculated at DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G(d)/lanl2dz
level.

Conclusions
We
report mononuclear cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes incorporating
aromatic phosphonate ligands, namely, [Ir(ppy)2(HL1)]·0.5H2O (1), [Ir(ppy)2(HL2)]·0.5H2O (2), [Ir(dfppy)2(HL1)] (3), and [Ir(dfppy)2(HL2)]·3.5H2O (4) (ppy =
2-phenylpyridine, dfppy = 2-(2,4-difluorophenyl)pyridine). Their luminescent
and electrochemical properties have been studied. Both the experimental
and theoretical results demonstrate that the expansion of the aromatic
conjugation length of the ancillary phosphonate ligand can significantly
decrease the LUMO energy level and hence the HOMO–LUMO gap.
This work provides not only a new route to manipulate the electronic
and optical properties of cyclometalated iridium(III) complexes by
introducing phosphonate ligands but also possibilities to anchor cyclometalated
iridium(III) complexes on metal oxide surfaces through phosphonate
ligands for device applications.
