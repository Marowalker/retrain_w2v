Humiclike
substances (HLS) have been demonstrated to be useful
auxiliaries to drive the (photo)-Fenton process at mild pH, by avoiding
iron inactivation via formation of active complexes. However, the
actual performance of the process is affected by a manifold of opposite
processes. In this work, the generation of hydroxyl radical-like reactive
species in the Fentonlike process has been investigated using electron
paramagnetic resonance, employing 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide as a probe molecule. The signal obtained with the
Fe(II)–HLS–H2O2 system at pH =
5 was very intense but decreased with time, in line with the difficult
reduction of the formed Fe(III) to Fe(II). On the contrary, the signal
of the Fe(III)–HLS–H2O2 system
was weak but stable. The most intense signal was observed at HLS concentration
of ca. 30 mg/L. Interestingly, the performance of the Fenton system
at pH = 5 to degrade caffeine followed the same trends, although caffeine
removal was very low after 1 h of irradiation. The results were more
evident in a solar simulated photo-Fenton process, where an increase
in the abatement of caffeine was observed until an HLS concentration
of 30 mg/L, where 98% removal was reached after 1 h.

==== Body
Introduction
The Fenton reagent, which consists of
a combination of iron salts
and hydrogen peroxide, has been widely used in wastewater treatment
processes because of its ability to oxidize organic matter.1 Although the mechanism is complex, hydroxyl radicals
are described to play a major role in the process. One among the factors
that enhance the effect of Fenton reagent is irradiation in the UV–vis
range (540 nm < λ, and hence sunlight can be used for this
purpose).2 On the contrary, mild pH is
detrimental for pollutant oxidation, as the optimum value is 2.8 and
iron inactivation occurs at higher values, attributable to the formation
of iron hydroxides.1,3

To overcome the environmental
and economic barrier that involves
the sequence acidification- (photo)-Fenton-neutralization,4 different strategies have been proposed to drive
the (photo)-Fenton process at mild pH.3,5 In particular,
the use of chemical auxiliaries able to complex iron has been studied
as a way to modify the coordination sphere of this cation and to prevent
its inactivation.6 It is important to highlight
that these iron(III) complexes must be photoactive to allow carrying
out the iron photoreduction. For this purpose, different substances
have been studied, such as carboxylates,7 EDTA, EDDS, or NTA.8−11 Alternatively, macromolecules with chemical structures related to
humic substances have been investigated.12,13 These compounds contain functional groups (e.g., carboxylic acids,
amines, hydroxyls, or amides) able to complex iron efficiently.14,15

Humiclike substances (HLS) can be isolated from different
sources,
such as solid urban wastes or olive oil mill residues.16,17 They have been demonstrated to be nontoxic and able to drive the
photo-Fenton process at mild pH conditions.18 However, the real efficiency of the treatment based on the Fe–HLS
system is difficult to predict because of the combination of a complex
and not-well-established mechanism with the existence of opposite
effects.19

The HLS have been demonstrated
to be photoactive and able to generate
reactive species, such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals, to
a minor extent;20 however, this process
is not very efficient and only high amounts of HLS are able to reach
a noticeable pollutant degradation.21 On
the other hand, the Fe–HLS complex has been demonstrated to
increase the efficiency of photo-Fenton at mild pH, most probably
due to enhanced production of highly oxidizing species, such as hydroxyl
radicals.17

Alternatively, HLS are
colored molecules, whose absorbance is not
negligible in the UVA–vis region. Hence, they can act as inner
filters, decreasing the number of photons reaching the deeper parts
of the solution. This effect is expected to decrease the direct photolysis
of the pollutants, as observed with humic acids,22 and to limit the efficiency of the HLS–Fe system.

Being the HLS organic macromolecules, they are expected to interact
with the reactive species generated by the photo-Fentonlike process.
As a matter of fact, HLS have been reported to suffer significant
oxidation under mild photo-Fenton conditions, changing the structural
characteristics of these macromolecules.18 Taking this into account, a competitive process between the humiclike
substances and the pollutant is expected, which involves a decrease
of the rate of pollutant removal upon increasing the HLS concentration.
Furthermore, higher amounts of hydrogen peroxide will be required.

Finally, HLS are able to improve the photo-Fenton-based degradation
of pollutants at amounts that are above the limit of solubility.23 This might be attributed to the surface active
properties of these substances that are able to confine the pollutants
inside the micelles and, at the same time, to approach the substrates
and the photo-Fenton system.

To gain further insight into the
ability of the HLS–Fenton
system to generate reactive species, in particular, hydroxyl radicals,
indirect methods based on the detection of species that are formed
upon reaction with •OH have to be used.24 One of these analytical techniques is based
on the use of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). The adduct formed
by •OH and 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DMPO) gives a typical signal, as described in detail elsewhere.25 This procedure has already been employed to
estimate the ability of different substances to form hydroxyl radicals,
including phenols in wine26 or biological
systems.27 Also in the field of wastewater
treatment processes, EPR has been employed to detect the generation
of reaction species,28,29 and in particular, some studies
deal with the Fenton system.17,30,31 With this background, the aim of this paper is to estimate the relative
amount of hydroxyl radicals that can react with a pollutant under
different conditions. To avoid the effect of photolysis and the inner
filter, the experiments have been carried out in the dark. Finally,
those mechanistic results have been correlated with the performance
of the (photo)-Fentonlike system with HLS using caffeine as a probe
molecule. This molecule has been chosen because it is a substance
commonly found in effluents,32 and its
removal via the (photo)-Fenton process has been widely studied and
suffers negligible photolysis under solar conditions.

Results and Discussion
Generation
of Reactive Species by Fe(II)–HLS and Fe(III)–HLS
Systems
A first series of experiments were devoted to the
study of the ability of Fe(II) in combination with hydrogen peroxide
to form a DMPO-OH adduct, as well as the variation of the signal attributed
to this adduct vs time. The pH value was selected to be five, since
it is the highest pH value which can be employed to drive the photo-Fenton
process in the presence of HLS with an acceptable efficiency.5Figure 1a shows the signal obtained at pH = 5 in the presence of the
HLS (20 mg/L) and Fe(II) (5 mg/L), immediately after the addition
of hydrogen peroxide (34 mg/L); this corresponds to a molar ratio
Fe/H2O2 of 1:10 that has been reported to optimize
the generation of hydroxyl radicals.33 The
high signal/noise ratio shows that there was an efficient generation
of •OH under these experimental conditions. To see
if the ability of the Fe(II)–HLS is constant or varies with
time, the spectra were recorded again at different times after the
addition of hydrogen peroxide. The intensity of the signal was calculated
as an average of the height of the four characteristic peaks of the
spectrum and given in relative values. The obtained relative intensities
were plotted vs the delay time between addition of H2O2 and recording the spectrum. Figure 1b shows that there is a fast decrease in
the signal, what is compatible with an inactivation of the Fenton
system. This is a well-known phenomenon, which is attributable to
the existence of two main reactions in the Fenton process (eqs 1 and 2). The first equation is very fast and generates efficiently •OH; however, Fe(II) is oxidized to Fe(III) and the
reduction of Fe(III) is slow.34 Hence,
as the initial Fe(II) is oxidized, its concentration decreases and
there is a noticeable loss of efficiency in the generation of •OH. 1   2  Taking into account those results,
it seems
interesting to test the behavior of the system when iron is added
as Fe(III). Figure 2a shows that the signal to noise ratio is clearly lower in this case,
showing that the generation of hydroxyl radicals under these conditions
is less efficient. However, Figure 2b indicates that the signal of the adduct is nearly
constant vs time; hence, the Fe(III) does not suffer a remarkable
loss of efficiency in generating •OH. This is in
agreement with the above given explanation: eq 2 is the limiting step of the process, and
as Fe(III) is reduced to form Fe(II), •OH is quickly
formed by eq 1, and iron
oxidized again to Fe(III) closing the cycle; in other words, when
starting with Fe(III) instead of Fe(II), a steady state for Fe(II)/Fe(III)
speciation is quickly reached and hence a stable signal is obtained.
Hence, for practical reasons, the use of Fe(III) seems more advisable
for the rest of EPR-based experiments.

DMPO-OH adduct recorded at pH = 5 in the
presence of HLS (20 mg/L) and Fe(II) (5 mg/L), immediately after the

signal vs time.

It is interesting to compare the
mechanistic experiments with the
real behavior of the system. For this purpose, the Fenton degradation
of caffeine was studied. Figure 3 shows that there was a very fast initial pollutant
removal when the reaction was carried out with Fe(II) but then the
reaction was clearly slower. On the other hand, when Fe(III) was used,
the reaction was very slow but the reaction rate was kept constant
all along the process. This is completely in line with the signal
measured in the EPR experiments.

caffeine (C/Co, where Co is the initial concentration, namely 5 mg/L,
and C is the concentration at the sampling time)
vs time: (●) with
Fe(II) and (■) with Fe(III). The reaction was performed at
pH = 5, with 5 mg/L of iron and 60 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide.

Determination of the Effect of HLS Concentration
The
EPR signal of the DMPO-OH adduct was measured in the presence of different
amounts of HLS. The plot of the signal vs concentration of HLS can
be seen in Figure 4. It can be observed that even in the absence of a complexing agent,
generation of some •OH radicals occurs, more probably
due to the small fraction of iron that is not deactivated. As a matter
of fact, using an iron concentration below 1 mg/L is a strategy that
has been reported to implement the photo-Fenton process at mild pH,
when low efficiencies can be assumed. Interestingly, the natural amounts
of iron present in water have been used to remove pollutants at low
concentration.35

Figure 4 Plot of the relative
signal of the DMPO-OH adduct vs the concentration
of HLS at pH = 5, 5 mg/L of Fe(III) and 34 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide.

Addition of low amounts of HLS (below 10 mg/L)
does not seem to
increase significantly the production of •OH; this
can be attributable to the fact that there is not enough amount of
ligands to complex efficiently the iron present in the solution. However,
beyond this point, there is a clear enhancement in the generation
of reactive species, in line with the improved complexation of iron.
Beyond 30 mg/L, further addition of HLS did not result in a noticeable
increase in the EPR signal, which can be attributed to two different
causes: (a) most of the iron is already in the form Fe–HLS
and (b) the excess of HLS acts as a scavenger of the formed radicals,
thus producing a detrimental effect.

However, it is necessary
to relate the mechanistic results with
the real removal of the pollutants. For this purpose, a series of
experiments was carried out using caffeine as a model pollutant. The
Fenton process was carried out with 5 mg/L of caffeine, 5 mg/L of
Fe(III), and the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide. The efficiency
of the process was very low, as percentages of removal after 60 min
of treatment were systematically below 20%, in agreement with the
bad performance of the Fenton system at pH = 5 (see Figure 5). However, significant differences
could be observed: the caffeine removal was lower with 10 mg/L of
HLS than in the absence of this compound, while HLS amounts in the
range 20–40 mg/L were able to enhance caffeine degradation.
These trends are coincident with the generation of •OH radicals detected by the EPR experiments.

Figure 5 Caffeine removal calculated
after 60 min of Fenton (gray bars)
and photo-Fenton treatment at pH = 5 of a 5 mg/L solution of caffeine
in the presence of 60 mg/L of H2O2 and different
amounts of HLS.

To obtain more reliable data,
stronger experimental conditions
have to be employed, to enhance caffeine degradation. For this purpose,
the photo-Fenton removal of caffeine was studied under the same conditions
described above, but using simulated sunlight as the irradiation source. Figure 5 shows the percentages
of caffeine removal after 60 min of irradiation. These values were
always above 65%, in line with the higher efficiency of photo-Fenton
when compared with Fenton. Under those circumstances, trends became
more evident and coincident with the EPR data: the results were very
similar without HLS and with 10 mg/L of this substance; beyond this
point (20–40 mg/L), there was a clear enhancement of the process,
in line with the improved generation of reactive species. The best
results were achieved for 30 mg/L, as further addition of HLS did
not result in an improved formation of reactive species, according
to EPR experiments and the shadowing effect of the HLS might also
be detrimental.

To obtain additional evidence on this explanation,
the concentration
of iron was determined after 15 min and 60 min in the presence of
HLS in the range 0–40 mg/L. Figure 6 shows that the results are in agreement
with expectations, as the concentration of Fe(III) in solution increased
with increasing amounts of HLS. However, when HLS was above 30 mg/L
of HLS, the iron concentration was higher than 4 mg/L even after 1
h. The same experiment was carried out employing Fe(II) as a control
and, in agreement with its higher solubility, the initial 5 mg/L were
maintained for 1 h.

Figure 6 Concentration of total iron according to the o-phenantroline standard method after 5 min (white bars) and 60 min
(gray bars) at pH = 5 when 5 mg/L of Fe(III) were added in the presence
of different concentrations of HLS. A control experiment, involving
the addition of 5 mg/L of Fe(II) without HLS, is also given.

Finally, Figure 7 shows the plot of the relative concentration of caffeine
in two
selected experiments: without HLS and with 30 mg/L of HLS (which was
the optimal HLS concentration). It can be observed that initial reaction
rates were similar, but when HLS was not present, the decrease in
caffeine concentration was slower after 15 min of irradiation, and
the process nearly stopped after 45 min of treatment. This is explained
by deactivation of iron(III) at mild pH, which can be avoided by the
complexing effect of HLS.

(C/Co, where Co is the initial concentration, namely 5 mg/L,
and C is the concentration at the sampling time)
vs time in a photo-Fenton
process with 5 mg/L of iron(III) and 60 mg/L of hydrogen peroxide
at pH = 5: (○) without HLS and (■) with 30 mg/L of HLS.

Conclusions
EPR has been demonstrated
as a good method to gain further insight
into one of the aspects limiting the applicability of HLS to drive
the (photo)-Fenton process at pH = 5, namely the ability of generating
extra amounts of reactive species vs the scavenging role of those
substances in the generation of reactive species.

A very good
correlation has been observed between the trends found
with these mechanistic experiments and caffeine removal by a (photo)-Fentonlike
process. Too low amounts of HLS have no effect on •OH generation, since they are not able to complex efficiently the
iron present in the system, and too high concentrations are detrimental
because of the scavenging role of those organic substances for the
reactive species, thus decreasing their concentration. According to
EPR experiments and caffeine removal by photo-Fenton, the best results
were achieved with 30 mg/L of HLS.

Finally, Fe(III) has been
demonstrated to be more useful for the
DMPO-OH measurement; although the signal is lower than that obtained
with Fe(II), it is more stable vs time because of the mechanism of
the Fenton process.

Experimental Section
Reagents
Iron(II)
sulfate, iron(III) chloride, hydrogen
peroxide (30% w/w), sodium hydroxide, and sulfuric acid (96%) were
supplied by Panreac. 5,5-Dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide
(DMPO) and caffeine were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Water employed
in all solutions was of Milli-Q grade. Humiclike substances were isolated
from urban wastes following a procedure previously described in detail.16 Briefly, it involves basic digestion of the
wastes, followed by filtration to remove the nonsoluble phase. Then,
ultrafiltration was employed, and HLS were concentrated in the retantate.
Finally, the solid HLS were obtained upon evaporation of water in
an oven. The composition of the HLS can also be found elsewhere.14

EPR Analyses
The amount of HLS required
for each experimental
condition was dissolved in Milli-Q water, and the pH was adjusted
to 4.5. Then, the iron salt was dissolved to reach a concentration
of 5 mg/L of Fe(II) or Fe(III). The pH was carefully adjusted to 5
by dropwise addition of hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide; then,
DMPO (17 mM) was added to the sample and finally hydrogen peroxide
(1 mM) was also added. Once hydrogen peroxide is present in the solution,
the reaction starts, and therefore it was the last reactive species
added to minimize the time between the addition of all reagents and
the EPR measurements.

EPR spectra were acquired at room temperature
with a Bruker ESP300E spectrometer. Measurements were carried out
in quartz capillary tubes. The following parameters were set: the
microwave frequency was 9.78 GHz, and the power was 5 mW; the modulation
frequency was 100 kHz with an amplitude of 0.4 Gauss; and the time
constant was 40 ms. For the Fe(III) experiments, 10 scans were accumulated
(this was not necessary in Fe(II) measurements because of the high
intensity of the signal). The intensity was determined by an average
of the height of the two central lines of the DMPO-OH spectrum, and
then the value was normalized.

(Photo)-Fenton Reactions
Reactions were performed in
open glass cylindrical reactors (55 mm i.d.), which were loaded for
each experiment with 250 mL of solution containing caffeine (5 mg/L),
iron (5 mg/L) added as iron(III) chloride, and HLS (0–40 mg/L).
The pH was adjusted to 5 by adding diluted sulfuric acid and then
hydrogen peroxide (60 mg/L), which accounts for the stoichiometric
amount required to mineralize the caffeine. In the photo-Fenton experiments,
a solar simulator (Sun 2000, Abet Technologies) equipped with a 300
W Xenon Short Arc Lamp was employed as the irradiation source; a glass
filter was employed to cut off the residual radiation below 300 nm.
Throughout the experiment, samples were periodically taken to be analyzed;
they were diluted 1:6 with methanol to avoid further reaction because
of the excess of H2O2. Before analysis, samples
were filtered through polypropylene (0.45 μm; VWR int.).

Chemical
Analyses
The concentration of caffeine was
determined by liquid chromatography, using a Flexar UHPLC FX-10 chromatograph
(PerkinElmer). The stationary phase was a Brownlee Analytical DV C18
column. The mobile phase consisted of a gradient of acetonitrile (A)
and formic acid, 0.01 M (B), which was changed from 5% of A to 50%
of A in 4 min. The flow was 0.3 mL/min. The apparatus is also equipped
with an autosampler, (S200 Autosampler Comm KIT-1022 PUS), a pump
(Flexar FX-10 UHO PUMP), a thermostatic oven, and a UV detector (UV/VIS
KIT-UHPLC Detector Tubing). Detection was based on absorption at 275
nm. The amount of iron present in solution was determined according
to the o-phenantroline standard method.
