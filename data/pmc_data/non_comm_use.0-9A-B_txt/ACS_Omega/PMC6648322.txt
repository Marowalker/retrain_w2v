This study presents the preparation
and use of a “green”
cross-linker derived from a waste soy flour sugar (SFS) mixture to
cross-link keratin in wool fibers to increase their tensile properties.
Earlier studies of keratin cross-linking involved chemicals such as
glyoxal and glutaraldehyde that are toxic to humans. In addition,
their effectiveness in improving tensile properties has been significantly
lower than obtained in this study using modified SFS. Characterization
of SFS using 13C NMR revealed the presence of five sugars
having different molecular lengths. Oxidation of SFS using sodium
periodate resulted in multiple aldehyde groups, as confirmed by 1H NMR and attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared
(ATR-FTIR). The oxidized SFS (OSFS) when used to cross-link the amine
groups from the wool keratin resulted in 36 and 56% increase in the
tensile strength and Young’s modulus of the fibers, respectively.
These significant increases in strength and Young’s modulus
were a result of having multiple aldehyde groups on each sugar molecule
as well as different molecular lengths of sugars, which favored cross-links
of multiple lengths within the cortical cell matrix of wool fibers.
The cross-linking between the aldehyde groups in OSFS and amine groups
in wool fibers was confirmed using ATR-FTIR and from the color change
resulting from the Maillard reaction as well as decrease in moisture
absorption by the fibers. Stronger wool fibers can not only increase
the efficiencies of wool fiber spinning and weaving and reduce yarn
and fabric defects but can also allow spinning finer yarns from the
same fibers. Oxidized sugars with optimum molecular lengths can be
used to cross-link other biological proteins as well, replacing the
currently used toxic cross-linkers.

Introduction
Wool is the most important
animal fiber used in textiles and many
other applications. It is a fully renewable but expensive fiber that
is known for its comfort, warmth retention, moisture absorption, and
elasticity.1,2 Although wool is most commonly obtained
from sheep, hair from other animals, such as goats, llamas, and alpacas,
are also used. The fleece (raw wool) obtained from the animals contains
30–70% impurities, such as sand, dirt, grease, dried sweat,
etc., most of which are removed through the scouring process.3 The cleaned dry wool is commonly processed through
a carding machine and comber to produce a continuous web or sliver
(wool top) with individual fibers parallel to each other.4 The length of fibers in the sliver can vary from
2 to 6 in. depending on the wool variety and the processes used. Sliver
is drawn to the desired linear density and twisted during spinning
to form continuous yarn.4 Since wool fibers
are inherently weak, fiber breakage during spinning and weaving processes,
which are commonly carried out under tension, is a significant problem.
Fiber breakages reduce the production efficiency, create fabric defects,
and generate significant amounts of fiber and fabric wastes.4 Increasing the strength of the fibers can not
only solve these issues but also allow spinning finer yarns from the
same fibers, significantly increasing their value.

There have
been many improvements in the genetic modifications
of wool by selective breeding of sheep as well as by providing better
nutrition to increase the length, fineness, yield, and strength of
the fiber.3 Plasma treatment of wool fibers
has also been shown to reduce fiber breakage during the spinning process.5 Genetic modifications and plasma treatments,
however, can be expensive. Chemical cross-linking can be much less
expensive and an easier way to enhance the tensile properties of the
fiber. The chemical composition of wool has shown the presence of
many polar and nonpolar amino acids. Amino acids with polar groups,
e.g., in soy proteins, have shown excellent possibilities for chemical
modifications through cross-linking.6 Although
the exact content of polar amino acids varies on the basis of the
source, high contents of amino acids, such as arginine (19.1%), serine
(8.7%), glutamic acid (8.5%), and cystine (7.3%), have been found
in merino wool.7 Amino acids with acidic
side chains, such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, asparagine, and
glutamine, account for about 10% of the total amino acids. Amino acids
with basic side chains, such as lysine, histidine, and tryptophan,
account for 3.5%. Threonine and tyrosine are amino acids with hydroxyl
groups in the side chain and account for 9% of the total amino acids.7 Glycine, leucine, proline, valine, alanine, isoleucine,
and phenylalanine amino acids without reactive groups on their side
chains account for about 30% of amino acids.7 In most cross-linking cases involving proteins, bifunctional cross-linkers,
such as glyoxal, glutaraldehyde, diisocyanates, and carbodiimides
have been used.8−10 Some formaldehyde-based cross-linkers have also been
reported.11 These cross-linkers are skin
irritant and toxic, not only to cells and biological systems but also
to the environment.9,12 As a result, they pose a great
danger to the health of the users. Formaldehyde has been classified
as a carcinogen and is being banned in many places.

Soybean,
a legume species, is an important agricultural and industrial
crop. It is one of the major oil seeds produced in the U.S. and worldwide.
Soybean makes up over half of all oil seeds in the world market. There
has been an increase in the use of soybean oil to produce biodiesel
in the last few years.13 Apart from oil,
soybeans are also a major source of edible plant-based protein. Defatted
soy flour (SF) is obtained as a by-product after extracting oil from
soybeans. It consists of 50–54% protein, 30–32% carbohydrate,
2–3% dietary fibers, and other minor components, such as minerals,
ash, and moisture.14 SF is purified to
obtain soy protein concentrate (SPC) and further purified to get soy
protein isolate (SPI). The purification process involves removing
the 30–32% carbohydrates present in SF. The carbohydrate mixture,
a by-product of SPC and SPI production, is generally discarded as
waste.15 It consists of five different
sugars: monosaccharides (fructose and glucose), disaccharide (sucrose),
trisaccharide (raffinose), and tetrasaccharide (stachyose).14 Raffinose and stachyose are not digestible by
humans or animals. These sugars, as a mixture, can be modified and
utilized for nonedible purposes.15

The main goal of this research was to cross-link protein (keratin)
in wool fiber using a natural “green” cross-linker formulated
using soy flour sugars (SFS) and enhance the tensile properties. SFS,
extracted from SF, was characterized, chemically modified, and used
as an inexpensive and nontoxic cross-linker for keratin, the protein
in wool. The sugars in SFS were oxidized (OSFS) using sodium periodate
(NaIO4) to obtain aldehyde groups on them, as shown in Figure 1. Oxidation of the
sugar mixture in SFS produces multiple lengths of oxidized sugars
containing aldehyde groups. Although the high number of functional
(aldehyde) groups obtained can provide chemical reaction with a majority
of the amine groups in keratin, the presence of different sugars,
i.e., different molecular lengths, improves the possibility of reaching
all reactive sites in keratin. These reactions lead to formation of
both intermolecular as well as intramolecular linkages in the proteins,
forming a cross-linked system. The effects of chemical cross-linking
on the performance properties of wool fibers such as tensile properties
were studied.

Results and Discussion
Characteristics of SFS
13C NMR has been
an important tool for the structural elucidation of carbohydrates.16,17Figure 2 shows the 13C NMR spectra of various sugars, such as fructose, glucose,
sucrose, raffinose, stachyose, and the SFS obtained in this study.
As seen in Figure 2, all pure sugars showed chemical shifts between 60 and 110 ppm.17−19 Fructose and glucose are reducing monosaccharides consisting of
six carbons each. The aqueous solutions of these monosaccharides consist
of equilibrium mixtures of their tautomers.20 In solution, fructose exists as an equilibrium of fructopyranose,
fructofuranose, and other forms, including acyclic structures.20 Glucose exists in α and β pyranose
together with its open-chain forms.19 The 13C NMR spectra of fructose (Figure 2a) and glucose (Figure 2b) show more than six carbons because they show tautomeric
structures as they are present in aqueous solution.20 Sucrose is a nonreducing disaccharide made up of fructose
and glucose. 13C NMR spectrum of sucrose is shown in Figure 2c. The 12 carbons
from sucrose are seen between 60 and 110 ppm.21 Raffinose is a nonreducing trisaccharide composed of galactose,
glucose, and fructose consisting of 18 carbons, as seen in its spectrum
shown in Figure 2d.
Stachyose is also a nonreducing tetrasaccharide but consists of two
galactose units, one glucose and one fructose unit with a total of
24 carbons, as seen in its spectrum shown in Figure 2e. The spectrum of SFS (Figure 2f) shows chemical shifts between
60 and 110 ppm, as seen in all other sugars mentioned above, confirming
the presence of different sugars in the SFS. Obendorf et al. have
shown that the embryos of soybean seed accumulate sucrose, raffinose,
and stachyose during seed development and maturation.22 Qiu and Netravali showed that SFS extracted from the same
SF as in the present case, consisted of 21.21 g/L sucrose, 11.92 g/L
stachyose, 1.92 g/L fructose and glucose (combined), 1.59 g/L raffinose,
water, and other compounds, such as water soluble proteins, using
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis.14 Their data indicate that sucrose and stachyose
are present in large amounts amongst all sugars in SFS.14 The 13C NMR spectrum of SFS (Figure 2f) shows all chemical
shifts present on sucrose and stachyose spectra (Figure 2c,e), confirming their presence
in SFS.

(d) raffinose, (e) stachyose, and (f) SFS.

Characteristics of SFS and OSFS
Figure 3 presents attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform
infrared (ATR-FTIR) and proton NMR spectra of SFS and OSFS. Figure 3a shows ATR-FTIR
spectra of SFS and OSFS. The ATR-FTIR spectrum of SFS shows absorption
peaks between 3700 and 2800 cm–1 and 1700 and 900
cm–1. The peaks between 1500 and 500 cm–1 are characteristic peaks of the saccharide configurations, as seen
in sugars, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and others.23 For example, the peak at 918 cm–1 corresponds to C–H bending in the saccharides.23 The peak at 997 cm–1 is the
characteristic peak of sucrose associated with the disaccharide linkage
α-d-glucopyranosyl and β-d-fructofuranosyl
groups.24 The peaks at 1043 and 1250 cm–1 correspond to the C–O stretch in the C–OH
group of the saccharides, whereas the peak at 1411 cm–1 corresponds to the combination of OH bending of COH group and C–H
bending of alkenes.23,25 The peak at 3270 cm–1 corresponds to the OH stretch from water.25 The ATR-FTIR spectrum of SFS shows all characteristic peaks present
in saccharides, confirming the presence of different sugars in it.
The exact percentages of different sugars in SFS determined earlier
by Qiu and Netravali using HPLC are presented in Table 1.14 As seen from Table 1, sucrose and stachyose are present in considerable amounts in SFS,
58 and 32.5%, respectively, comprising over 90% of the total sugars.
Fructose and glucose are reducing sugars and can exist in open-chain
form in equilibrium, forming aldehyde or ketone groups. Unlike monosaccharides
such as fructose and glucose, sucrose, raffinose, and stachyose are
nonreducing sugars and do not exist in open-chain form and, importantly,
none of them have aldehyde groups. However, they can be oxidized to
convert the hydroxyl groups to aldehyde groups. Figure 1 presented earlier showed the proposed oxidation
reaction of sucrose and stachyose. As seen in Figure 1, NaIO4 cleaves the vicinal diols
and oxidizes the hydroxyl groups to aldehyde groups.26 Sucrose and stachyose have 5 and 11 secondary hydroxyl
groups, respectively, which form the vicinal diols that can be broken
and oxidized to 4 and 8 aldehyde groups, respectively (Figure 1). Thus, oxidation of sucrose
and stachyose forms polyaldehyde (tetra-aldehyde sucrose and octa-aldehyde
stachyose) derivatives (Figure 1). These aldehyde groups were confirmed through the ATR-FTIR
spectrum of OSFS, as shown in Figure 3a through the absorption peak at 1720 cm–1. A similar peak at 1718 cm–1 was seen by Jalaja
and James after oxidizing sucrose using NaIO4.27 The peak intensities of both 1250 and 1411 cm–1, which correspond to the C–OH bending in sugars,
are seen to reduce as a result of oxidation of hydroxyls to aldehyde
groups.23 Similarly, glucose, fructose,
and raffinose in SFS get oxidized to form aldehyde groups as well.
Since these three sugars account for less than 10% of the total sugars
in the SFS solution, Figure 1 presents only the sucrose and stachyose reactions.

spectra and (b) 1H NMR spectra of SFS and
OSFS.

Different Sugars
in SFS14

The formation of polyaldehyde was also confirmed from
the 1H NMR spectra. Figure 3b shows the 1H NMR spectra of SFS and OSFS.
The
spectrum of SFS shows characteristic sugar proton shifts at 5.4 ppm
and between 4.2 and 3.2 ppm.28 The proton
shift at 4.7 ppm is the solvent peak from D2O. The proton
shifts between 3 and 4 ppm represent −CH and −CH2 in the sugars.29 The proton shifts
at 4 and 4.2 ppm represent the protons from the vicinal diols of the
sugars. The additional peak in OSFS at 8.3 ppm shows the formation
of aldehyde groups upon oxidation of SFS. Liu et al. observed the
free aldehyde peak upon oxidation of sucrose using NaIO4 between 8 and 8.5 ppm.29 The additional
small proton shifts seen between 5 and 5.6 ppm show the formation
of hemiacetals because of the intermolecular reaction between aldehyde
and hydroxyl groups. Similar proton shifts were observed by Xu et
al. and Liu et al. after oxidizing sucrose using NaIO4.26,29 The change in pH of SFS from 5.5 to 3 after oxidation also confirms
the presence of aldehyde groups in OSFS.

Characteristics of Control
and Cross-linked Wool Fibers
Figure 4 presents
the ATR-FTIR spectra of wool fibers. Whereas Figure 4a shows the ATR-FTIR spectra of control and
cross-linked wool fibers from 4000 to 500 cm–1, Figure 4b shows the spectra
from 1800 to 1000 cm–1. The spectrum for untreated
(control) wool fiber shows a broad peak at around 3268 cm–1. This peak is assigned to O–H stretching from adsorbed water
and N–H bending vibrations from the amide A linkages.30 The peak at 2923 cm–1 is due
to CH2 and CH3 stretching vibrations, whereas
the peak at 1447 cm–1 is due to C–H bending
in protein. The spectrum for control wool fiber also shows three main
characteristic peaks between 1700 and 1200 cm–1.
For example, the strong absorbance peak at 1628 cm–1 is associated with the C=O stretch from the amide I linkages.31 The medium strong absorbance peak at 1515 cm–1 is assigned to N–H in-plane bending in amide
II linkages.31 The peak at 1233 cm–1 is assigned to the C–N stretch of the amide
III linkages.30,31 The aldehyde groups of OSFS can
react with the amine groups from keratin to form imine linkages, as
shown in Figure 5.
Oxidized sucrose present in OSFS has four aldehyde groups whereas
stachyose, the longer molecule, has eight aldehyde groups, and, in
theory, all aldehyde groups can react with the amine groups present
in keratin to form cross-links. This cross-linking leads to the formation
of imine linkages. It is, however, very difficult to see formation
of new imine linkages in the cross-linked fibers due to spectral complexity
of the proteins.15,32−34Figure 4b presents ATR-FTIR spectra
of control and cross-linked wool fibers from 1800 to 1000 cm–1. As can be seen in Figure 4b, the spectrum of cross-linked wool fibers shows an additional
small peak at 1040 cm–1, which corresponds to the
C–O stretch in C–OH as well as C–C stretch in
the sugars.23 This confirms the incorporation
of OSFS within wool fibers. A similar additional peak at 1049 cm–1 was observed after cross-linking soy proteins with
oxidized sugars.15 Jalaja and James observed
a peak at 1030 cm–1 corresponding to the C–O–C
stretch of sugar moiety after cross-linking gelatin with oxidized
sucrose.27 The spectrum of cross-linked
wool fibers in Figure 4b also shows a small peak at 1341 cm–1, which is
not present in the spectrum of control wool fibers. This peak corresponds
to the OH bending of the C–OH group and is present in sugars
from SFS and confirms the presence of sugars after cross-linking.23 The shift in the amide I peak at 1628 cm–1 shows that the secondary structure of wool has changed
after cross-linking.35 It was observed
that the amide II peak changed from the sharp and narrow peak to a
broad peak between 1510 and 1540 cm–1 after cross-linking.
A similar change in the amide II peak was observed when gelatin was
cross-linked using glutaraldehyde.36 The
cross-linking reaction between primary amine groups in wool keratin
with aldehydes from OSFS is through the formation of Schiff’s
base.27,37 The cross-linking of wool fibers can also
be confirmed by the change in color and mechanical testing of the
fibers. These results are discussed later.

and cross-linked wool fibers from (a)
4000 to 500 cm–1 and (b) 1800 to 1000 cm–1.

base
(imine) formation.

Table 2 shows the L*, a*, and b* values
of control and cross-linked wool fibers. The change in color after
the Maillard reaction can be used to confirm cross-linking of proteins.15,32,38 As shown in Table 2, the control fibers showed L*, a*, and b* values
of 78.02, −0.96, and 3.80, respectively. Wool fibers cross-linked
using OSFS (wool-OSFS) showed significant increase in the b* (yellowness) values. The b* value increased
from 3.80 for control fibers to 5.31 and 8.64 after cross-linking
with OSFS at 140 and 150 °C for 20 min, respectively. The increase
in b* after treating with OSFS is another evidence
of cross-linking reaction between the oxidized sugars and the amino
acids from wool keratin. The higher b* value for
wool-OSFS at 150 °C (8.64) as compared to that for wool-OSFS
at 140 °C (5.31) is due to the increased extent of cross-linking
with the increase in the temperature. A similar change in color was
observed when dialdehyde starch was used to cross-link soy protein
isolate.38 Other dialdehyde sugars and
aldehydes, such as glutaraldehyde and glyoxal, have also resulted
in yellow/brown coloration after cross-linking the proteins present
in wool, zein, gelatin, soy protein isolate, soy flour, collagen,
and other proteins, typical to the Maillard reaction.15,36,38−42

Two types of browning have been observed after heating of sugars.
The first one is caramelization, caused by heating of sugars, which
breaks down the molecules giving the yellow/brown color. The second
is the Maillard reaction, in which the browning is caused by heating
reducing sugars in the presence of protein (amino groups). Reducing
sugars in OSFS, such as fructose and glucose, contain aldehyde groups
in the open-chain form, whereas nonreducing sugars, such as sucrose,
stachyose, and raffinose, contain aldehyde groups due to oxidation.
The Maillard reaction between aldehyde groups in OSFS and amino groups
in keratin causes the increase in the b* value. To
confirm that the change in color was due to the Maillard reaction
(and not caramelization), wool sliver was treated with pure SFS solution
at 150 °C for 20 min. The pictures of the treated wool slivers
are shown in the Supporting Information (Figure S1). As can be seen from the Figure S1 and in Table 2, the b* value of SFS-treated wool (wool-SFS) sample is close
to that of the pure wool sample, showing no evidence of caramelization.
Thus, the increase in b* value for OSFS-treated samples
proves that the browning is due to the Maillard reaction.15,38,42 Cross-linking of wool using OSFS
was restricted to 140 and 150 °C because caramelization of sugars
and subsequent pyrolysis is prominent at temperatures above 160 °C.43

Figure 6 shows typical
stress–strain plots of control and cross-linked wool fibers.
As seen in Figure 6, the stress–strain plots can be divided into three distinct
regions: the initial Hookean region, yield region, and the postyield
(strain hardening) region. Tensile properties of control and cross-linked
fibers are summarized in Table 3. As seen in Figure 6, the initial Hookean region lies between 0 and 3.4% strain
for both control and cross-linked fibers. This region exhibits a linear
relationship between stress and strain. Wool protein, in the relaxed
state, is called α-keratin, wherein the keratin molecules are
unstressed and in their natural helical shape. At a low level of strain
(∼3.5%), the distortion involves extension of weaker bonds,
such as hydrogen bonding within the amino acids (seen in Figure 5), Van der Waals
forces, and Coulombic interactions.44 The
folded α-helix structure of the fiber, hydrogen bonds between
the helices, Coulombic interactions due to side chains, and some −COO– and −NH3+ groups oppose
the distortion or strain. It was observed that the tensile stress
of the fibers, at the end of the Hookean region, increased from 88
MPa to about 116 MPa, an increase of about 32%, after cross-linking
with OSFS whereas the tensile strain reduced from 3.4 to 3.1%. Also,
Young’s modulus of the fibers in the Hookean region increased
from 2.5 to 3.9 GPa, an increase of 56%, after cross-linking. Increases
in tensile stress and Young’s modulus values after cross-linking
in the initial Hookean region were found to be statistically significant
using an unpaired t-test at a significance level
of 0.05. The increase in the tensile stress and Young’s modulus
is clearly a result of the cross-links formed within the microfibrils,
macrofibrils, and in the matrix region of the cortical cells of the
wool fibers, which oppose the deformation. The microfibrils embedded
within the matrix in the cortical cells are responsible for the strength
of the fibers.45 The Maillard reaction
between aldehyde groups from OSFS and amine groups of the keratin
molecules creates intermolecular covalent bonding between the fibrils.
This leads to an increase in tensile stress and modulus in the initial
Hookean region after cross-linking.

control and cross-linked
fibers.

and Cross-linked Fibers

Beyond the initial 3% strain, the strain increases rapidly for
a small increase in the stress. This region is called the “yield
region”. The overall stress in the yield region increased from
88 MPa for control fibers to over 119 MPa, an over 35% increase, for
cross-linked fibers. At the same time, the yield region, which extended
from 3.4 to 25.3% for control fibers, changed from 3.1 to 21.7% for
cross-linked fibers and the stress at the yield point increased from
117 to 146 MPa. The reduction in the tensile strain, from 25.3% for
control to 21.7% for cross-linked fibers confirms the formation of
cross-links between the peptide chains that restrict the molecular
movement. The modulus in the yield region was also found to increase
from 0.18 to 0.27 GPa after cross-linking (50% improvement in the
modulus).

Beyond the yield region, the wool fibers stiffen rapidly.
This
region is called the postyield region, and the stiffening phenomenon
is called strain hardening. The postyield region terminates on the
rupture of the fiber. As seen in Figure 6, the strain-hardening phenomenon in the
postyield region is more prominent in the cross-linked fibers as compared
to that in the control fibers. The tensile fracture stress of the
fibers increased from 203 to 276 MPa after cross-linking, a 36% increase.
The tensile strain was found to reduce from 47.4 to 41.8% after cross-linking.
The secant modulus for the strain-hardening region increased from
0.35 to 0.53 GPa (51.4% increase) after cross-linking. Unpaired t-test showed that the increase in the moduli for all three
regions after cross-linking of the fibers was statistically significant
at the significance level of 0.05. As mentioned earlier, OSFS contains
a mixture of different sugars having aldehyde groups. The major sugars
present in OSFS sucrose and stachyose form tetra-aldehyde and octa-aldehyde,
respectively, with different molecular lengths. This makes it easy
to form various cross-links with the protein side chains and allows
forming a better three-dimensional network within the fiber, leading
to an increase in the tensile stress and modulus in all regions of
the fiber stress–strain plots. Hassan et al. cross-linked wool
fibers using four different cross-linkers and found that the tensile
strength increased from 103 to 111.7, 115.2, 116.2, and 122 MPa for
glyoxal, itaconic anhydride, naphthalene disulfonic acid, and succinic
anhydride cross-linked wool fibers, respectively.46 They observed a maximum of 18.5% increase in the strength
of the wool fibers after cross-linking with succinic anhydride.46 As seen earlier, cross-linking of fibers with
OSFS showed an increase of about 36% in the tensile strength (from
203 to 276 MPa). This shows that the natural soy flour sugar-based
green cross-linker is more effective in improving tensile properties
of wool fibers than all other toxic bifunctional aldehyde-based cross-linkers
currently used.

Keratin fibers have a tendency to absorb moisture,
which plasticizes
them and causes a decrease in Young’s modulus.45 The moisture content of the conditioned fibers reduced
from 9.14% in control fibers to 6.6%, a decrease of about 28%, after
cross-linking. As expected, the three-dimensional network obtained
by cross-linking creates a more compact structure that acts as a moisture
barrier. Reduced moisture absorption is beneficial since it can reduce
the effect of moisture on fiber tensile properties. The cortex of
the wool fiber is composed of ortho and para cortical cells. The para
cortical cells contain disulfide (S–S) cross-links resulting
from cystine amino acid, whereas the ortho cortical cells do not have
S–S covalent cross-links, allowing them to absorb more moisture
compared with para cortical cells. This results in ortho cortical
cells swelling and elongating more than para cortical cells, which
causes the crimp in the fiber. Absorbing less water could automatically
reduce the undesired issues related to crimp.

Surface Characteristics
of Control and Cross-linked Wool Fibers
Figure 7 shows scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) images of the surfaces of the control and
cross-linked wool fibers taken at different magnifications. Figure 7a,b shows control
wool fibers with scales on the surface. These scales form the cuticle
layer on the fiber surface.47Figure 7c,d shows the surfaces
of cross-linked fibers. When compared, the cross-linked fibers do
not show any effect on the scalar structure of the fiber cuticle.
No visible change or damage of scales can be observed after cross-linking
the fibers with OSFS. Oxidized sugar molecules from OSFS are small
molecules that can penetrate inside the cortex of the fiber and cross-link
them internally, enhancing the tensile properties, while leaving the
surface unchanged.

wool fibers.

Figure 8 shows SEM
images of the fractured ends of control and cross-linked fibers taken
at different magnifications. As seen in Figure 8, the fracture surfaces of both control and
cross-linked fibers show similar fracture characteristics. It can
also be seen from the tensile plots of the fibers (Figure 6) that the fibers do not fracture
in a stepwise fashion but undergo a catastrophic failure after the
strain hardening.

Conclusions
The
present study has successfully demonstrated that the tensile
performance of the wool fibers can be enhanced significantly using
a green bio-based cross-linker. The utilization of SFS, a by-product
with no potential application, showed promising results after oxidizing
it to a polyaldehyde. This valorizes the by-product from soy processing
industry and reduces the waste. The presence of different sugars in
SFS was found to be beneficial by not only providing multiple aldehyde
groups but also different molecular lengths, increasing the cross-linking
efficiency. The higher cross-link density within the wool fiber improves
its strength and modulus significantly. The room-temperature extraction
and oxidization process used in this study is also an energy efficient
way of making a natural, bio-based cross-linker for protein-based
polymers. The availability of SFS at a very low cost and ease of oxidation
reaction make it scalable at the commercial level. The method presented
here can be easily extended for cross-linking other protein-based
materials. The OSFS prepared in this study can easily replace currently
used toxic cross-linkers, such as glyoxal and glutaraldehyde. Enhanced
tensile properties of wool fibers can not only increase the efficiencies
of wool fiber spinning and weaving by reducing breakages but can also
reduce yarn and fabric defects. More importantly, stronger wool can
allow spinning finer yarns from the same fibers, increasing their
value significantly.

Experimental Section
Materials
Wool
fibers in sliver form and defatted soy
flour (SF) were provided by Raymond Woolen Mills, India and Archer
Daniels Midland Co., Decatur, IL, respectively. Sodium periodate ≥99%
and stachyose were purchased from Acros Organics, Bound Brook, NJ.
Barium dichloride (BaCl2) was purchased from VWR, Rochester,
NY. Glucose, fructose, sucrose, and raffinose were purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich. Analytical grade sodium hydroxide (NaOH) pellets and
hydrochloric acid 37% reagent grade (HCl) were also purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., Allentown, PA.

Extraction of Sugars from
SF
SF (65 g) was added slowly
to 400 mL of deionized (DI) water and stirred at 300 rpm at room temperature
(RT) until a homogeneous SF mixture was obtained. The pH of the mixture
was adjusted to 4.5 using HCl. At 4.5 pH, most of the amino acids
present in the proteins from SF are at their isoelectric point and
remain insoluble in water. The mixture was stirred overnight at 300
rpm at RT to dissolve all sugars present in SF into water. The sugars
were then filtered using a microfiber polyester fabric to remove the
insolubilized protein from SF. The pH of the filtered solution containing
the sugars was then adjusted to 5.5 using NaOH, stirred for 6 h at
RT, and filtered again to remove the small amount of the remaining
protein having amino acids with isoelectric points close to 5.5. The
filtered solution containing soy flour sugars is termed SFS. Two-hundred
and fifty milliliters of SFS was obtained after filtering twice. Assuming
that we extract 30% residual sugars from the SF, the final concentration
of sugars after filtration in SFS was close to 5%.

Oxidation of
SFS
Oxidation of SFS was carried out using
NaIO4. Different molar ratios (MR), 0.5 to 2.5 MR, of NaIO4 to sugars were used to optimize the oxidizing reaction. (See
Supporting Information Figure S2 for optimization
of reaction.) The oxidation reaction was carried out in the dark for
22 h at RT with gentle stirring at 200 rpm. At the end of the reaction,
the required amount of BaCl2 was added to the solution
to stop sugars from further oxidation (see Supporting Information Figure S3). The solution was stirred for 5 min
after addition of BaCl2 and then placed at 4 °C for
1 h to allow complete precipitation of barium iodate Ba(IO3)2. It was then filtered to obtain the supernatant solution
containing the mixture of oxidized SFS (OSFS). The pH of the prepared
OSFS was found to be 3.

Wool Fiber Cross-linking
Wool sliver,
7.5 in. long,
was cut and immersed in a flat form in the prepared OSFS solution
for 10 min at RT in a rectangular Pyrex box. After 10 min of immersion
in OSFS, the sliver was taken out and gently squeezed to remove excess
solution. The wet sliver was immersed in the flat form again in the
OSFS solution for 1 min at RT, then taken out and gently squeezed
again to ensure uniform wet pickup by all fibers in the sliver with
OSFS. The wet sliver was placed flat on a glass plate and cured in
an air-circulated oven at 140 and 150 °C for 20 min to allow
the cross-linking between aldehyde groups from OSFS and amine groups
in wool keratin, as shown later in Figure 4. The sliver was flipped upside down after
the half curing time (10 min) in the oven to ensure a uniform treatment
to all fibers. The sliver was taken out and placed flat in a Pyrex
box containing DI water for washing. The cross-linked sliver was washed
2–3 times with water to remove all unreacted sugars from the
fiber surface. The cross-linked fibers in the sliver were dried and
conditioned at ASTM conditions of 65 ± 3% relative humidity (RH)
and 21 ± 1 °C for 24 h prior to any testing.

Characterization
of SFS, OSFS, Control, and Cross-linked Wool
A complete 13C NMR analysis was performed to characterize
SFS and various sugars present in SFS. The structural/chemical differences
in SFS upon oxidizing were studied using 1H NMR. 13C and 1H NMR spectra were recorded on an INOVA 400 spectrometer
(Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA) using D2O as the solvent for
both.

Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared
(ATR-FTIR) analysis was done to characterize the effect of oxidation
on SFS. ATR-FTIR was also used to study the cross-linking of wool.
The ATR-FTIR spectra were collected using a Thermo Nicolet Magna-IR
560 spectrometer (Madison, WI) having a split pea accessory. Each
scan was an average of 300 scans from 4000 to 500 cm–1 wavenumbers.

CIELAB color parameters of control and cross-linked
wool fibers
were measured using a Macbeth Color-eye spectrophotometer, Model M2020PT,
(Newburgh, NY). The L*, a*, and b* values stand for L* = 0 (black) to L* = 100 (white), −a* (greenness)
to +a* (redness), and −b*
(blueness) to +b* (yellowness). A standard value
for the white calibration tile (L* = 95.91, a* = −0.43, b* = 1.01) was used
to calibrate the spectrophotometer.

Tensile properties of single
fibers were characterized using an
Instron universal testing machine, model 5566 (Instron Corp., Canton,
MA). Single wool fibers were individually mounted on rectangular paper
tabs, and the two ends were secured using a self-adhesive tape. The
diameters of every single fiber were measured using a calibrated optical
microscope, Olympus, model BX51 (Melville, NY), at three different
locations, and the average was used to calculate the tensile properties
of each fiber. The fibers were conditioned and tested at 65 ±
3% RH and 21 ± 1 °C at a gauge length of 20 mm and a strain
rate of 0.6 min–1. Thirty single fibers were randomly
chosen from different parts of the wool sliver of each type (control
and cross-linked) for testing and statistical analysis. For the cross-linked
fibers, 10 fibers were chosen from each of the three different slivers
treated at different times using OSFS solutions prepared at different
times to ensure reproducibility of the results. A Savitzky–Golay
fitting was used to smooth the tensile stress–strain plots.48 Linear regression was performed on the smoothed
plots to get accurate modulus values of the fibers. The unpaired t-test was used to test if the control and cross-linked
fiber properties were statistically significant from each other.

To study the effect of cross-linking on the surface of the fibers
and the fracture behavior of the control and cross-linked wool fibers,
the surface and the fractured ends of the fibers fractured during
the tensile tests were carefully mounted on standard aluminum stubs
with double-sided electrically conductive carbon tapes and characterized
using a Zeiss Gemini 500 scanning electron microscope, Germany, at
0.25 kV.
