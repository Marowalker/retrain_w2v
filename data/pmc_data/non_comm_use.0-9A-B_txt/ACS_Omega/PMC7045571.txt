Here, we describe
the recent progress toward construction of 1-azabicyclic
structures using a domino hydroformylation double cyclization strategy
of an amide bearing the trisubstituted alkene functionality. The method
provides a rapid and atom-economic access to alkaloid structures under
mild conditions, especially for quinolizidine and pyrrolidine-fused
azepane skeletons with yields up to 82% and good diastereoselectivity.
Subsequent oxidative cleavage conditions are developed for the synthesis
of Dendrobatid alkaloid epi-epiquinamide.

Introduction
A domino reaction design
has received attention in synthetic organic
chemistry because it provides reliable, efficient, and environmentally
friendly alternatives from readily available starting materials.1−5 The development of a new domino reaction sequence can be considered
a significant intellectual challenge, which does not bring only practical
efficiency but also an aesthetic appeal in the human mind.6−8 Therefore, it has been emerged as a mainstream in synthetic organic
chemistry. Due to the mild conditions and compatibility for common
functionalities, the Rh-catalyzed hydroformylation9−11 appears to
be a useful tool in synthetic organic chemistry.12−18 As part of our interest in domino reaction, here we describe a novel
one-pot Rh-catalyzed domino hydroformylation double cyclization for
rapid construction azabicyclo heterocycles.

The design is outlined
in Scheme 1: Rh-catalyzed
hydroformylation of the monosubstituted
alkene 1 produces desired linear aldehyde 2, which can trigger a series of intramolecular transformations spontaneously
(Scheme 1). Aldehyde 2 undergoes the first condensation with the amide moiety to
give aminal 3. Subsequent dehydration occurs to yield
N-acyliminium 4. Different from our previous strategy,19,20 the present design takes advantage of a trisubstituted alkene as
the π nucleophile21 to proceed the
intramolecular Mannich cyclization to form a stable tertiary carbocationic
bicyclized product 5. Releasing a proton in an E1 manner
yields gem-disubstituted alkene 6 rather
than a tetrasubstituted alkene, probably due to significant A1,3-strain in the latter situation. The resulting alkene 6 will not undergo further hydroformylation because it requires
a higher pressure and forced conditions.

Scheme 1 Rh-Catalyzed Domino
Hydroformylation Double Cyclization of Trisubstituted
Alkenes, Illustrated by the Example of Allylamide Substrate 1a
Compared to the nucleophilic
arylacetylene group, the trisubstituted
alkene group provides more diversity in the flowing chemical transformations.
Moreover, the resulting isopropenyl group is able to provide more
diversity in the following chemical transformations. Therefore, we
design three kinds of amide substrates: allyl amides (1a, 1d, and 1g), butenamides (1b, 1e, and 1h), and homoallylamides (1c, 1f, and 1i), to investigate
the scope and limitation of the idea (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Design substrates for the double reaction.

Results and Discussion
These amides
are readily prepared from the corresponding acids
and amines by means of a standard carbodiimide coupling or a chloroformate
activation protocol. At first, allylamide 1a was chosen
as the model system to find the conditions and subjected to the previously
developed conditions, that is, the use of 10 mol % PTSA at 60 °C,
4 atm of CO/H2 (1:1), and 0.05 M substrate concentration.
The results are summarized in Table 1. Pleasingly, we were able to isolate the desired product 6a albeit in 14% yield as a 1.4:1 inseparable cis/trans mixtures22 and
monocyclized product aminal 3a in 20% (entry 1). The
treatment of aminal 3a in with BF3·OEt2 in dichloromethane afforded the cyclized product 6a in 66% yield (eq 1). 1

It suggested that the amount of
acid might be a crucial role in
the reaction. Thus, we attempted to increase the amount of the acid
to improve the yield. Addition of 50 mol % PTSA in the reaction improved
the cyclized product in 28% yield, as well as 3a in 20%
yield (entry 2). The addition within 1 equiv of pTSA afford the desired
product 6a in 66% isolated yield (entry 3). However,
more amount of pTSA did not bring significant improvement in the yield
of product 6a but resulted in disappearance of product 3a (entries 4–6). It was noteworthy to point out that
the resulting germinal alkene moiety did not undergo further hydroformylation
as we anticipated. In addition, we found that the monocyclized product 3a would suffer weight loss during purification, probably
due to decomposition in silica gel or in acidic conditions for a long
time. Thus, direct treatment of the crude residue with BF3·OEt2 in dichloromethane after evaporation to remove
acetic acid brought satisfiying results. Such an operation rendered
complete formation of bicyclized product 6a in 82% isolated
yield (entry 7).

Once the optimized conditions were in hand,
we were able to study
the scope and limitation of the reaction using various amide substrates
(Figure 2). The reaction
of 3-butenamide 1b under the optimized conditions afforded
only one diastereomer, trans 4-oxoquinolizidine 6b in 75% yield, while the reaction of the other isomer homoallylamide 1c afforded both cis- and trans-6-oxoquinolizidine 6c in 63% yield as inseparable mixtures
(1.5:1). In addition, in the investigation on 6-methyl-5-heptenamide
substrates (1d and 1f, m = 2), only the reaction of allylamide 1d could afford
pyrrolidine-fused azepane 6d as a single trans product in a good yield of 78%, while the reactions of the butenamide 1e and the homoallylamide 1f could not provide
the cyclized products. The reactions of allylamide 1g and homoallylamide 1i did not give the anticipated
bicyclized product 6, but the reaction of butenamide 1h could produce the desired product only in 27% yield as
a 2.5:1 inseparable mixture of cis/trans isomers.

Figure 2 Results of hydroformylation double cyclization.

To extend the following functional group transformation,
our attention
next turns to examining a protocol for utilization of the isopropenyl
group (Table 2). The
exposure of indolizidine 6a in the ozonolysis conditions
gave only a decomposed result (entry 1). The treatment with OsO4–oxone in DMF failed to produce methylketone product
(entry 2).23 However, Upjohn dihydroxylation,
that is, a catalytic amount of OsO4 and a stoichiometric
amount of NMO followed by NaIO4 cleavage of the resulting
diol afforded 31% of cis-ketone 7a and
27% of trans-ketone 7a (entry 3). A
better result was achieved by employing the Nicolaou’s protocol.24 Treatment with NMO and 2,6-lutidine in the presence
of a catalytic amount OsO4 in acetone/water followed by
addition of DAIB (diacetoxyiodobenzene) produced 44% of cis-ketone 7a and 37% of trans-ketone 7a (entry 4).

After being treated with DBU in dichloromethane at room temperature
overnight, cis-ketone 7a was transformed
completely to the trans isomer 7a. The
results indicated trans-ketone 7a was
thermodynamically stable product. The condensation of trans ketone 7a with tosylhydrazine in refluxing methanol
resulted in the formation of tosylhydrazone derivative trans-8a (Scheme 2). The precipitate could be recrystallized from the solution
to give single crystals (see the Supporting Information, CCDC no. 1920287) for the X-ray diffraction analysis. It apparently
possesses a trans configuration between two methines,
that is, C-8 and C-8a.

Scheme 2 Epimerization of cis-Ketone 7a to trans Isomer and Tosylhydrazone Derivative 8a and ORTEP Structure of 8a
To demonstrate the methodology, we develop a series of
simple operations
for synthesis of Dendrobatid alkaloid epi-epiquinamide
(Scheme 3).25−32 Following the optimized oxidative cleavage conditions, trans quinolizidine 6b was transformed to trans-ketone 7b in 88% yield. Reduction with LiAlH4 to reduce two carbonyl groups afforded a diastereomeric mixture
of quinolizidine alcohol 9b in 74% yield. Exposure of
alcohol 9b with Dess–Martin periodinane afforded
the methylketone 10b in 89% yield, in which the tertiary
amine remained intact during oxidation. The methylketone 10b was subjected to condensation with hydroxylamine to afford oxime 11b, which would be converted to an amide group through Beckmann
rearrangement. Thus, the resulting oxime 11b was treated
with PCl5 in dichloromethane to produce amide 12 in 20% yield as a 1:1 mixture of cis/trans isomers, while with TFA to obtain methylketone 10b in
38% yield. The reaction of oxime 11b with sulfonyl chloride
such as TsCl and MsCl gave the sulfonates as a leaving group,33 which should enhance the nucelofugality34,35 and improve the response. However, subsequent treatment with triethylamine
led either to recovery of the starting materials or to complete destruction
if in forcing conditions. Treatment of oxime 11b with
cyanuric chloride in DMF at an elevated temperature36 afforded the arranged product as a 1:3 mixture37 of the cis (epiquinamide) to trans (epi-epiquinamide) amide 12 in a combined
yield of 64%. The spectra data were identical to those reported.32

Scheme 3 Syntheses of Epiquinamide
In summary, we have reported a novel reaction, trisubstituted
alkene-mediated
domino hydroformylation/double cyclization, to synthesize indolizidine,
quinolizidine, and pyrrolidine-fused azepane skeleton from simple
amide derivatives. Subsequent elaboration of the bicyclic product 6 into ketone 7 was effected by the optimized
cleavage conditions and furnished a Dendrobatid alkaloid epi-epiquinamide in six steps. The methodology provides
rapid construction of azabicyclo[4.4.0]decane and azabicyclo[5.3.0]decane
systems based on the excellent diastereoselectivity. Further applications
of other natural products are under investigation and will be reported
in due course.

Experimental Section
The reactions
were performed under an argon atmosphere and in an
anhydrous solvent, unless otherwise stated. The solvents and reagents
were dried or refined according to the literature procedures. The
crude products were purified by flash column chromatography on silica
gel to give isolated yields. All NMR spectra, for example, 1H, 13C, DEPT, gCOSY, gHSQC, and gHMBC, were recorded on
a 400 MHz or a 600 MHz NMR spectrometer, which provided all necessary
data for the full assignment of each compound. Chemical shifts (δ)
are reported in ppm using residual undeuterated solvent as an internal
standard. Coupling constants are described in Hertz. The X-ray crystal
results have been checked to obtain the corresponding CCDC number.
Mass spectra were recorded on a mass spectrometer with a magnetic
sector using the electrospray ionization (ESI) or fast atom bombardment
(FAB).

General Procedure for the Preparation of Amide Substrates 1a–1i38,39
Method A
To a
solution of the corresponding acid (10.0
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in THF was added triethylamine (1.47 mL, 10.5 mmol,
1.05 equiv) at room temperature under an atmosphere of nitrogen followed
by addition of methyl chloroformate (0.81 mL, 10.5 mmol, 1.05 equiv).
After 20 min, the corresponding amine (1.05 equiv) was added. The
reaction mixture was allowed to be stirred overnight (∼21 h)
under nitrogen. On completion of the reaction, the solvent was removed
in vacuo, and the reaction mixture was partitioned with diethyl ether
(20 mL) and water (30 mL). The aqueous solution was extracted with
diethyl ether (20 mL ×3) again. The combined organic layers were
washed with brine (50 mL), dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give a crude
product. Purification of the crude product by flash chromatography
on silica gel using EtOAc/n-hexane as the eluant
afforded the corresponding amide in a high yield.

Method B
To a mixture of the corresponding acid (10.0
mmol, 1.0 equiv), EDC (1.917 g, 10.0 mmol, 1.1 equiv), and HOBt (1.836
g, 12.0 mmol, 1.3 equiv) in CH2Cl2 (5.0 mL)
in an ice bath was added the corresponding amine (10.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv)
via a syringe. The reaction mixture was allowed to stir overnight
(∼21 h) under nitrogen. The reaction mixture was partitioned
with CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and saturated NaHCO3 solution (10 mL). The organic layer was washed with saturated
NH4Cl solution (10 mL). The aqueous solution was extracted
with CH2Cl2 (20 mL ×2) again. The combined
organic layers were washed with brine (10 mL), dried over anhydrous
Na2SO4, and then concentrated under reduced
pressure to give a crude product. Purification of the crude product
by flash chromatography on silica gel using EtOAc/n-hexane as the eluant afforded the corresponding amide in a high
yield.

General Procedure for the Domino Double Cyclization
Rh(acac)(CO)2 (1.3 mg, 5.0 μmol, 0.5 mol %) and
BIPHEPHOS (7.9 mg, 10 μmol, 1.0 mol %) were dissolved in AcOH
(1 mL) under argon. The resulting catalyst solution was degassed by
a frozen–thawed procedure at least three times. Amide (1a, 167 mg, 1.0 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and pTSA (17 mg, 0.1 mmol,
10 mol %) were placed in a 50 mL flask. The catalyst solution was
transferred to the reaction flask containing the substrate by a pipette,
and the total volume was adjusted to 20 mL with AcOH. The reaction
flask was placed in a 300 mL stainless steel autoclave and then was
pressurized with CO (2 atm) followed by H2 (2 atm). The
reaction mixture was stirred at 60 °C for 16–20 h. Upon
completion of the reaction, the gas was carefully released in a good
ventilated hood, and the reaction mixture was concentrated under reduced
pressure to give a crude residue. The residue was partitioned with
CH2Cl2 (20 mL) and NaHCO3(aq) (saturated,
10 mL). After separation of the organic layer, the aqueous layer was
extracted with CH2Cl2 (15 mL ×5). The combined
organic layers were dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, filtered, and then concentrated under reduced pressure to give
the crude product. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography
on silica gel using MeOH/CH2Cl2 or EtOAc/n-hexane as the eluant to give the product.

General Procedure of the Oxidative Cleavage
To the
mixed solution of acetone (16.5 mL) and water (1.5 mL) of the alkene
substrate (6a, 323 mg, 1.80 mmol, 1.0 equiv) under argon
was added 2,6-dimethylpyridine (0.42 mL, 3.60 mmol, 2.0 equiv), N-methylmorpholine oxide (50%, 0.6 mL, 2.70 mmol, 1.5 equiv),
and OsO4 (2.3 mg, 0.009 mmol, 0.5 mol %). The solution
was allowed to be stirred overnight (∼20 h) at 40 °C.
The reaction was monitored by TLC in which the Rf value of the starting material alkene is about 0.24 (MeOH/CH2Cl2 = 1:20), while the Rf value of the product diol is about 0.10 in the same eluent. Upon
completion of the reaction, PhI(OAc)2 (DAIB, 870 mg, 2.7
mmol, 1.5 equiv) was added and stirred overnight (∼20 h) at
60 °C. TLC analysis was used to follow the reaction. After evaporating
the volatiles, the resulting reaction mixture was diluted with dichloromethane
(20 mL) and washed with saturated Na2S2O4 solution (30 mL). The aqueous layer was extracted with dichloromethane
(20 mL ×3). The organic layer was washed with brine (10 mL),
dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and then concentrated
under reduced pressure to give a crude product. Purification of the
crude product by flash chromatography on silica gel using ethyl acetate
and n-hexane as the eluant gave the two titled products.

trans-9-Acetylquinolizidine
(trans-10b)
To a CH2Cl2 solution
(4 mL) of alcohol trans-8b (34 mg, 0.185
mmol, 1.0 equiv) in an ice bath under argon was added Dess–Martin
reagent (86.5 mg, 0.204 mmol, 1.1 equiv) in three portions. The ice
bath was removed, and the reaction mixture was allowed to be stirred
at room temperature for 4 h. Upon completion of the reaction monitored
by TLC analysis, the reaction was quenched with saturated NaHCO3 solution (15 mL). After filtration with a short Celite pad
and separation of the organic layer, the aqueous layer was extracted
with CH2Cl2 (10 mL ×4) again. The combined
organic layers were washed with brine, dried over anhydrous Na2SO4, and then concentrated under reduced pressure
to give a crude product. The crude product was purified by flash chromatography
on Chromatorex N-H typed silica gel using ethyl acetate/n-hexane as the eluant afforded the titled product as a
light yellow oil (29 mg, 0.16 mmol, 86%): Rf = 0.37 (EtOAc/n-Hex = 1:5); 1H NMR (600
MHz, 25 °C, CDCl3, δ): 1.12–1.18 (m,

Epi-Epiquinamide (12b)
To
a mixture of ketone trans-10b (179
mg, 0.987 mmol, 1.0 equiv) and hydroxylamine (0.36 mL, 5.92 mmol,
6.0 equiv) in in a 50 mL single-necked round-bottom flask was added
benzene (14 mL) and EtOH (6 mL). The flask was equipped with a Dean-Stark
trapper and a condenser, and the reaction mixture was allowed to be
refluxed overnight (∼18 h) under argon to remove water. Upon
completion of the reaction monitored by TLC analysis, in which the Rf value of the starting material ketone was
0.24 (EtOAc/n-Hex = 1:5), the reaction mixture was
concentrated under vacuum to afford light yellow oil crude product
oxime. The product was used directly without further purification.
To a DMF solution (1 mL) was added cyanuric chloride (182 mg, 0.987
mmol, 1.0 equiv). After being stirred at room temperature for 30 min,
the solution was slowly added with the crude oxime solution in DMF
(10 mL) by a cannula. The reaction mixture was allowed to be stirred
under reflux overnight. Upon completion of the reaction monitored
by TLC analysis, water (2.0 mL) and saturated Na2CO3 solution (1.5 mL) were slowly added into the reaction mixture.
After separation of the organic layer, the aqueous layer was extracted
with CH2Cl2 (10 mL ×3). The combined organic
dried over Na2SO4. After removal of the solid
dehydrating agent, the organic layer was concentrated under reduced
pressure to give a crude product. Purification of the crude product
by flash chromatography on silica gel EtOAc/n-Hex
as the eluant gave the titled product as a light yellow solid (124
mg, 0.632 mmol, 64%, cis/trans =
1:3): mp 158–162 °C; Rf =

The relative stereochemistry of the cyclized
product 6a was determined by the coupling constants of
the bridge methine (H-8a). The coupling constants of H-8a in the cis isomer are 10.8, 6.0, and 6.0 Hz, while those in the trans isomer are 10.2, 10.2, and 4.8 Hz. The two larger
coupling constants indicate two diaxial interactions and indicate
the trans configuration between H-8 and H-8a. The
integral value comparison could provide the ratio of two isomers.
The cis/trans ratio of product 6c and 6h was obtained in the same way.

The cis/trans ratio of the product is determined by the inverse gate decouple
technique in the 13C NMR to integrate the values of the
signals of two key carbons C-9: δ 48.7 (cis), δ 51.0 (trans) and C-9a: δ 64.1 (cis), δ 67.3 (trans).


Substitution of freshly prepared prenyl bromide
with either NaCN or LiCH2CN prepared by the treatment of
acetonitrile and n-butyl lithium gives 4-methyl-3-pentenitrile
and 5-methyl-4-hexenitrile, respectively. Hydrolysis of the resulting
nitriles within basic hydrogen peroxide conditions yields the corresponding
acids, 4-methyl-3-pentenoic acid and 5-methyl-4-hexenoic acid, respectively.
For the preparation of 6-methyl-5-heptenoic acid, see:

Reduction of the corresponding nitriles
with
LiAlH4 yields the amines such as 4-methyl-3-penteneamine
and 5-methyl-4-hexeneamine. 6-Methyl-5-heptenenitrile is prepared
by condensation of the 6-methyl-5-heptenoic acid with ammonia by the
chloroformate activation protocol followed by dehydration of the resulting
amide with POCl3 in pyridine.
