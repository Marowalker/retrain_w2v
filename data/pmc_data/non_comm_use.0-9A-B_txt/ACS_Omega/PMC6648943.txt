Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction
catalysts were prepared by treating Bi2MoO6 sheets
with aqueous NaHCO3 solutions
at room temperature. All the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions exhibited higher activities
than pristine Bi2MoO6 in the photocatalytic
degradation of rhodamine B (RhB), methyl orange, and ciprofloxacin
under visible-light irradiation, and the most active photocatalyst
was found to be the one with a C/Bi molar ratio of ∼1/2.3.
Relevant samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron
microscopy, N2 adsorption–desorption, Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy, and UV–vis spectroscopy. The higher
activity of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 than pristine Bi2MoO6 is explained
by the enhanced separation and transfer of photogenerated electron/hole
pairs, as verified by transient photocurrent densities, photoluminescence
spectroscopy, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Photogenerated
holes (h+) and superoxide radical anions (•O2–) were found to be the main active
species. The good reusability of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 was testified by cycling degradation
of RhB and tetracycline hydrochloride.

1 Introduction
TiO2, a benchmark photocatalyst, works efficiently under
UV light that merely accounts for a very small fraction of sunlight.
Seeking new catalysts that can make full use of sunlight, especially
the visible light portion, is a meaningful topic. Bi2MoO6, a nontoxic and visible light-responsive semiconductor, is
promising for making photocatalysts.1−4 Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts
with different morphologies or structures (e.g., nanoparticles,5 nanotubes,6 nanosheets,7 flowerlike structures,8,9 and
hollow microspheres10,11) have been developed. However,
the recombination of photogenerated carriers is still a serious problem
when using pristine Bi2MoO6 as a photocatalyst.12 It is of great interest to develop Bi2MoO6-based modified photocatalysts with enhanced photocatalytic
performance.

Bi2MoO6-based modified photocatalysts
can
be prepared by depositing metals (e.g., Pt,13 Pd,14 and Ag15) onto Bi2MoO6, doping Bi2MoO6 with metal ions (e.g., Er3+,16 Gd3+,17 Ho3+,17 and Yb3+17), and integrating Bi2MoO6 with other
substances such as TiO2,18 RGO,19 g-C3N4,20 MoS2,21 Ag/AgCl,22 Ag2MoO4,23,24 Ag3VO4,25 Ag2O,26−28 Ag–Ag2CO3,29 Ag2CO3,30 MxOy (M = Cu, Co, Ni),31 Fe2O3,32 ZnFe2O4,33 Bi2S3,34 BiOX (X = Cl, Br, I),35−37 Bi2O2CO3,38−40 BiVO4,41 Ta3N5,42 Bi4MoO9,43 Bi2Mo2O9,44 Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55,45,46 Bi4V2O11,47 and Bi2Mo3O12.48 The numerous references cited above indicate that research
along this direction is popular. However, Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts
have been seldom reported,38−40 although Bi2O2CO3 has been combined with other substances (e.g.,
Cu2O,49 Co3O4,50 ZnFe2O4,51 Bi,52 Au–Bi2O3,53 Bi2O4,54,55 Bi4O7,56 Bi2S3,57 BiOCl,58,59 BiOBr,60 BiOI,61 BiVO4,62 Bi2WO6,63 Ag2O,64 Ag2CO3,65 AgI,66 carbon quantum dots,67 and porphyrins68) to form heterojunction photocatalysts.69 In general, the formation of heterojunction
systems is an efficient way to design visible light-responsive
photocatalysts.70−72

As for the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction system, Xu et
al. prepared Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 by
subjecting a mixture containing BiOCl, MoO42–, and g-C3N4 to hydrothermal treatment at 180
°C.38 The formed sesame-biscuit-like
Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterostructures showed enhanced performance in photocatalytic degradation
of rhodamine B (RhB). Zhang and co-workers prepared microsphere-like
Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunctions composed of nanoplatelets of Bi2O2CO3 and Bi2MoO6 via a template-free
solvothermal process.39 The obtained samples
showed high photocatalytic activity in the degradation of RhB. Wang
and co-workers prepared a meshlike Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 composite composed of many
nanoparticles via a hydrothermal method using urea to tune the morphology.40 They again demonstrated the superior photocatalytic
activity of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 than Bi2MoO6 in the degradation
of RhB. A quaternary heterostructured Ag–Bi2O2CO3/Bi3.64Mo0.36O6.55/Bi2MoO6 composite was also synthesized and
tested in visible light-driven photocatalysis.73

In these relevant papers,38−40 the morphologies
of the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 materials
are very interesting, but there is still room for developing Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 materials
with different morphologies via facile preparation methods, demonstrating
the advantages of the materials in different reactions and elucidating
the reaction mechanisms.

Herein, Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 nanosheets were prepared
via a facile route, that
is, by reacting Bi2MoO6 with aqueous NaHCO3 at room temperature. These materials were characterized and
tested in the photocatalytic degradation of industrial dyes [RhB and
methyl orange (MO)], ciprofloxacin (CIP), and tetracycline hydrochloride
(TC) under visible-light irradiation. Reasons for the enhanced photocatalytic
activity were investigated. A possible photodegradation mechanism
based on Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 was proposed. Even though Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 has been reported by other
groups,38−40 the current work differs from these previous studies,
in terms of the preparation method, morphology of the heterojunctions,
and scope of photocatalytic reactions. At the end of the paper, we
will provide more discussions on what is learned from this work and
what can be done in the future.

2 Results
and Discussion
2.1 Basic Characterization
of Samples
X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize
Bi2MoO6 and Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5). As seen in Figure 1, the obtained pristine
Bi2MoO6 is orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no.
21-0102). Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5) samples mainly exhibit orthorhombic
Bi2MoO6 peaks. The strongest (013) peak (2θ
= 30.3°) of tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 (JCPDS no. 41-1488) appears for S3, S4, and S5 with theoretical
C/Bi molar ratio of 1/2.3, 1/1.8, and 1/1.5, respectively (Figure 1). This peak enhances
when going from S3 to S5 because of the addition of more NaHCO3 during the synthesis. No other impurity peaks can be observed.
The presence of residual NaHCO3 can be excluded because
the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 samples were thoroughly washed by water and our later X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) characterization excludes the presence
of residual Na.

Figure 1 XRD patterns of Bi2MoO6 and Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5),
and standard XRD patterns of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no. 21-0102) and tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 (JCPDS no. 41-1488).

According to scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterization,
pure Bi2MoO6 manly consists of irregular nanosheets
(Figure 2A). Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5)
samples contain Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with slightly
smaller sizes (Figures 2B and S1) probably because of the vigorous
stirring (1200 rpm) of the system for 4 h, after mixing Bi2MoO6 nanosheets with NaHCO3 solution.

Figure 2 SEM images
of (A) Bi2MoO6 and (B) S3 (Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6).

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution
TEM
(HRTEM) were used to characterize Bi2MoO6 and
typical Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 samples (S3 and S5). These samples show a 2D nanosheet structure
with irregular sizes (Figure 3), consistent with the SEM results (Figures 2 and S1). Figure 3B shows an HRTEM
image of Bi2MoO6. The lattice spacing is determined
to be 0.313 nm, corresponding to the (131) plane of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6 (JCPDS no. 21-0102). The HRTEM image of S3
(Figure 3D) also shows
the lattice stripe belonging to the (131) plane of orthorhombic Bi2MoO6. The surface is covered by a thin layer, most
likely Bi2O2CO3 because the corresponding
XRD pattern shows a peak corresponding to Bi2O2CO3 (Figure 1). Figure S2 enables us to take a closer
look at the interface. For S5, the HRTEM image shows the presence
of tetragonal Bi2O2CO3 nanoparticles
on the Bi2MoO6 surface (Figure 3F).

Figure 3 TEM and HRTEM images of Bi2MoO6 (A,B), S3
(C,D), and S5 (E,F).

The elemental distribution and composition in S3 were analyzed
by scanning TEM (STEM) mapping and TEM–energy-dispersive X-ray
(EDX). The STEM image confirms the nanosheet structure of S3 (Figure 4A). Bi, Mo, O, and
C elements distribute homogeneously (Figure 4B–E). The measured molar ratio of
C/Bi is 1/2.4 (Figure 4F), consistent with the theoretical value (1/2.3). Additionally,
EDX element mapping and EDX data from S5 confirmed the existence of
the related elements in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (Figure S3). The
measured molar ratio of C/Bi is 1/1.99 (Figure S3F), whereas the theoretical value is 1/1.5. Note that Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 samples
denoted as S1–S5 were prepared by adding a certain amount (3,
5, 7, 9, or 11 mL) of NaHCO3 solution (0.1 mol/L) to a
suspension containing 0.5 g of Bi2MoO6 (0.82
mmol) and 50 mL of water under vigorous stirring (1200 rpm), followed
by continuous stirring for 4 h. Thus, the EDX data indicate that NaHCO3 in the solution can not be completely consumed via reacting
it with Bi2MoO6 when it is overdosed.

images of S3.

Figure 5 presents
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra of Bi2MoO6 (red line) and S3 (blue line). Bi2MoO6 shows absorption bands at 400–900 cm–1.7 The bands at 843.0 and 796.3 cm–1 can be assigned to the asymmetric and symmetric stretching modes
of MoO6, respectively, involving vibrations of the apical
oxygen atoms.74 The band at 731.2 cm–1 is attributed to the asymmetric stretching mode of
MoO6 involving vibrations of the equatorial oxygen atoms,
and the band at 573.4 cm–1 corresponds to the bending
vibration of MoO6.75 The band
at 442.0 cm–1 is attributed to the stretching and
bending vibrations of octahedral BiO6.76 Two bands at 1628.6 and 1384.7 cm–1 are
ascribed to the stretching and bending vibrations of adsorbed water,
respectively. These absorption bands exist in both samples. Besides,
S3 also shows a peak at 1478.4 cm–1 because of the
internal vibration of CO32– for Bi2O2CO3.77 In
addition, compared to S3, pristine Bi2MoO6 shows
a clear peak located at 934.0 cm–1, which can be
ascribed to C–H bonds; this is because Bi2MoO6 was prepared in the presence of organic solvent (i.e., ethanol
and ethylene glycol).34

Figure 5 FTIR spectra of Bi2MoO6 and S3 (Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6).

The surface composition and chemical status of Bi2MoO6 and S3 were probed by XPS. In the survey spectra
for Bi2MoO6 and S3 (Figure S4), characteristic C, O, Bi, and Mo peaks are detected; no
impurities
(such as Na) are detected. The data indicate that no NaHCO3 is left behind after thorough washing during the synthesis stage.
Next, selected elements were picked for precise XPS scanning. For
the C 1s orbit scan of S3 (Figure 6A), three peaks at 284.6, 286.1, and 288.5 eV (attributed
to the C–C, C–O, and O–C=O groups, respectively)
are found, indicating the existence of adventitious carbon and CO32– in S3.78 S3
has apparently more carbonate species than Bi2MoO6.

Figure 6 High-resolution XPS spectra of (A) C 1s, (B) O 1s, (C) Bi 4f, and
(D) Mo 3d from Bi2MoO6 and S3 (Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6).

The O 1s peaks are deconvoluted
(Figure 6B). Bi2MoO6 shows two
deconvoluted O 1s peaks assigned to Bi–O (529.7 eV) and Mo–O
(531.8 eV). However, for S3, the carbonate peak (530.4 eV) increases
greatly at the expense of the Mo–O peak (531.8 eV), whereas
the Bi–O (529.5 eV) peak is still obvious. The data are consistent
with the TEM observation for S3, that is, the surface of Bi2MoO6 is covered by a Bi2O2CO3 layer (Figure 3D). Figure 6C shows
Bi 4f5/2 and Bi 4f7/2 peaks at 164.1 and 158.8
eV, respectively, confirming the presence of Bi3+ in S3.11 From Figure 6D, two peaks at 232.0 and 235.1 eV can be attributed
to Mo 3d5/2 and Mo 3d3/2, respectively, confirming
the presence of Mo6+ in S3.11 The positions of Bi 4f, Mo 3d, O 1s, and C 1s peaks of S3 are identical
to the corresponding positions of Bi2MoO6.

From the N2 sorption isotherms of Bi2MoO6 and S3 (Figure S5A), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller
(BET) surface areas of Bi2MoO6 and S3 are determined
to be 7.1 and 7.8 m2/g, respectively. The pore volumes
of Bi2MoO6 and S3 are 0.0089 and 0.0097 m2/g, respectively (Figure S5B).
The low surface areas and small pore volumes of these materials are
consistent with the bulk morphology of the materials (Figures 2 and 3).

2.2 Photocatalytic Performance
Photocatalytic
degradation of RhB (50 mL, 10 mg/L) was studied. As shown in Figure 7A, after 30 min in
the dark and 150 min under visible-light irradiation, RhB does not
degrade when no catalyst exists. The photodegradation efficiencies
clearly show the sequence S1 < S2 < S3 > S4 > S5. All
the S1–S5
samples are more active than Bi2MoO6. It is
noted that the rigorous stirring during the treatment of Bi2MoO6 by an aqueous NaHCO3 solution may make
the Bi2MoO6 sheets smaller (Figures 2 and S1). Thus, a control experiment was carried out, in which
Bi2MoO6 was rigorously stirred in water for
4 h, dried, and subjected to photocatalytic testing. The sample (Bi2MoO6-S) adsorbs less RhB than Bi2MoO6 during the dark adsorption stage, and the adsorption amount
is the same of those of S1–S5 samples. Thus, the activity trend
mentioned above can be confirmed. We also repeated the catalytic experiments
by using RhB (50 mL, 2.5 mg/L) with a concentration lower than before
(10 mg/L). In this case, the reaction takes less time, and a similar
activity trend can be observed (Figure S6).

Figure 7 Degradation curves of (A) RhB (50 mL, 10 mg/L), (B) MO (50 mL,
10 mg/L), and (C) CIP (50 mL, 10 mg/L) with using Bi2MoO6 or Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5) as a catalyst (30 mg).

S1–S5 samples are still more active than
Bi2MoO6 in the photocatalytic degradation of
MO (50 mL, 10 mg/L)
and CIP (50 mL, 10 mg/L), as shown in Figure 7B,C. The activities of S1–S5 still
show the sequence S1< S2 < S3 > S4 > S5. We additionally
found
that S3 is effective for the degradation of TC (50 mL, 5 mg/L, Figure S7).

The recyclability of S3 was
tested. To minimize the testing time,
low-concentration solutions of RhB (50 mL, 2.5 mg/L) and TC (50 mL,
5 mg/L) were used. In each run, 30 min dark adsorption and 60 min
reaction were involved. As shown in Figure S8, S3 can be reused without any loss of activity. By comparing the
XRD patterns (Figure S9) and SEM images
(Figure S10) of S3 before and after five
runs, we can clearly see that S3 remains the stable phase composition
and morphology/structure.

2.3 Reasons for the Enhanced
Activity
The question now arises why S3 is more active than
Bi2MoO6 in visible light-driven photocatalysis.
One reason
may be traced to its visible-light absorption. However, our UV–vis–diffuse
reflectance measurement (Figure S11) data
indicate that the addition of Bi2O2CO3 to Bi2MoO6 (S1–S5) does not lead to
enhanced visible-light absorption (λ > 400 nm). Thus, that
effect
is excluded as a reason. The difference in BET surface areas (Bi2MoO6: 7.1 m2/g; S3: 7.8 m2/g) is also small (Figure S5), whereas
the difference in photocatalytic activity is obvious (Figure 7).

The separation and
migration of photogenerated carriers usually play an important role
in determining the activity of a photocatalyst.79 The photocurrent response tests of Bi2MoO6 and S3 were conducted in the dark and under visible light
in 0.1 M Na2SO4 (Figure 8). Both Bi2MoO6 and
S3 generated transient photocurrent when the light was on, and the
photocurrent decreased sharply when the light was off. After four
intermittent on–off irradiation cycles, the photocurrent intensity
kept steady. S3 showed a remarkably enhanced photocurrent density
compared to Bi2MoO6, demonstrating the effective
separation of photoinduced electron/hole pairs in Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 upon exposure
to visible light.

Figure 8 Transient photocurrent densities of Bi2MoO6 and S3.

To gain insight into
the electron-transport and recombination properties
of the samples, EIS analyses were performed. The smaller radius of
the EIS Nyquist plot demonstrates the lower impedance and a higher
efficiency of charge transfer.80 As shown
in Figure 9A, S3 shows
a much smaller arc radius than Bi2MoO6, implying
that the separation efficiency of photogenerated charge carriers is
enhanced for Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6, thus extending the lifetime of photoexcited electron–hole
pairs.

Figure 9 (A) Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) Nyquist plots
and (B) photoluminescence (PL) spectra of Bi2MoO6 and S3.

PL spectra were employed to confirm
the enhanced separation efficiency
of photogenerated charge carriers. A lower PL emission intensity usually
means that a semiconductor has a stronger ability to facilitate the
separation and migration of photogenerated carriers.81 From Figure 9B, both Bi2MoO6 and S3 show a strong emission
peak centered at around 580 nm. S3 shows a lower peak intensity than
Bi2MoO6, meaning that S3 (Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6) can facilitate
the separation and migration of photoexcited electron/hole pairs more
efficiently.

Radical-capture experiments involving corresponding
scavengers
were performed to monitor the active radicals involved in the photoreaction
(Figure 10). For the
reaction system involving Bi2MoO6 (Figure 10A) or S3 (Figure 10B), the addition
of ammonium oxalate (1 mmol, scavenger of h+) could inhibit
RhB degradation obviously. Adding benzoquinone (0.02 mmol, scavenger
of •O2– species) also
led to the decrease of RhB degradation obviously. The existence of
isopropyl alcohol (1 mmol, scavenger of •OH species)
almost has no effect on RhB degradation. The data imply that the main
active species in photocatalytic degradation of RhB are h+ and •O2–, whereas •OH is not relevant.

Figure 10 Effects of scavengers on RhB degradation
in presence of (A) Bi2MoO6 or (B) S3.

An ESR spin-trap with the DMPO
technique was employed to confirm
the results of radical-capture experiments. Bi2MoO6 does not generate DMPO ESR spin-trapping signals of •O2– and •OH in the dark (Figure 11A,B). With light irradiation, Bi2MoO6 leads to the formation of •O2– but no •OH. Similar results are obtained when
testing S3 (Figure 11C–D). However, S3 can lead to the generation of more •O2–, as seen from stronger
DMPO ESR spin-trapping signals. This can be a reason for the enhanced
activity of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6.

Figure 11 5,5-Dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)
electron
spin resonance (ESR) spin-trapping signals of (A,B) Bi2MoO6 and (C,D) S3 (Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6) for •O2– and •OH.

In reference to the energy band positions of Bi2MoO6 (ECB = −0.37 V, EVB = 2.27 V)29 and
Bi2O2CO3 (ECB = 0.16 V, EVB = 3.56 V),49 we propose a possible photocatalytic mechanism
for Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 (Figure 12). Although Bi2O2CO3 cannot be excited
by visible light because of its wide band gap (Eg = ∼3.4 eV),49,82 Bi2MoO6 can be excited by visible light,83 thus producing photogenerated electrons (e–) and
holes (h+). Moreover, because the ECB of Bi2O2CO3 (0.16 V) is
more positive than that of Bi2MoO6 (−0.37
V), the photogenerated electrons will be able to flow to the conduction
band of Bi2O2CO3. Thus, the photogenerated
e–/h+ pairs in the heterojunction system
can be efficiently separated, which prolongs the lifetime of active
species existing in the reaction system. This explanation is consistent
with our mechanistic experiments (Figures 8–11). It should
be mentioned that Bi2O2CO3 cannot
be excited by visible light because of its wide band gap (Eg = ∼3.4 eV),49,82 and it has poor photocatalytic activity under visible light.50,56,84,85 Thus, the presence of more Bi2O2CO3 (exceeding the optimal content in S3) in the Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 heterojunction
catalyst (for the cases of S4 and S5) may lead to decreased photocatalytic
activity compared with that associated with S3.

degradation mechanism based on Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6.

2.4 Discussion
It should be mentioned
that the objective of this work was not to develop the most active
photocatalyst in the world. Numerous new catalysts with different
levels of activities have been reported. It is interesting to develop
catalysts with new compositions, structures/morphologies, functions,
or preparation methods and to understand the correlations among preparation
methods/details, structures/morphologies, and catalytic performance.86,87

To put the current work in perspective, we compare the activity
of the most active S3 catalyst in this work with those of Ag2O/Bi2MoO6,26 Ag2MoO4/Bi2MoO6,23 and Ag–Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO629 studied under
identical reaction conditions. As seen in Figure S12, the activity of the samples follows the sequence Ag2MoO4/Bi2MoO6 ∼ Ag–Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO6 ∼ Ag2O/Bi2MoO6 > Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6.

No attempt was
made to compare the activity of our Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalyst
with those of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalysts reported in the literature because the
reaction conditions are all different.38−40 Nevertheless, the trend
seen in our study is in line with the trend seen in others’
work,38−40 in the sense that the optimal Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalyst is more
active than Bi2MoO6. Further research may be
conducted to study the influence of the morphologies and sizes of
Bi2MoO6 and the preparation details (e.g., synthesis
and calcination temperatures) on the catalytic performance of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalysts.
In fact, the Bi2MoO6 supports used for the preparation
of Ag2O/Bi2MoO6 and Ag2MoO4/Bi2MoO6 mentioned above are
flowerlike microspheres,23,26 whereas the Bi2MoO6 supports used for the preparation of Ag–Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO629 and Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 in this study are sheets. A recent study by others
shows that Bi2MoO6 microspheres (instead of
sheets) can also be used to make efficient Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO6 photocatalysts.30 Thus, the morphology effect may be a subtle
effect that needs more carful studies in the future.

This work
also has important implications to the synthesis of Bi2MoO6-based heterojunction catalysts. In some cases,
NaHCO3 was used as a precipitation agent for the formation
of Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalysts.29 Our current work indicates that the reaction
between Bi2MoO6 and aqueous NaHCO3 to form surface Bi2O2CO3 can happen
even at room temperature. Thus, this side reaction should be considered
when synthesizing Ag2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalysts. Care should be taken to control the synthesis
procedure and the amount of NaHCO3 to avoid the formation
of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 unless the formation of Ag2CO3–Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 is
needed. In our previous work,29 AgNO3 solution was first mixed with Bi2MoO6 powders to allow for the adsorption of Ag+ onto Bi2MoO6 powders. A stoichiometric amount of NaHCO3 solution was then added into the system to allow for complete
reaction between Ag+ and NaHCO3 to form Ag2CO3 on Bi2MoO6. The reaction
between Ag+ and aqueous NaHCO3 is supposed to
be much faster than the conversion of solid-phase Bi2MoO6 to Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6. Thus, under the right synthesis conditions, the
unintentional formation of Bi2O2CO3 can be avoided.

3 Conclusions
Bi2MoO6 nanosheets modified with Bi2O2CO3 were prepared by chemical deposition.
The enhanced photocatalytic activities of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 were identified in degrading
RhB under visible light, and the optimal C/Bi theoretical molar ratio
was determined to be ∼1/2.3. The optimal Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 catalyst (S3)
was also found to be more active than Bi2MoO6 in degrading MO, CIP, or TC by visible-light photocatalysis. The
cycling degradation of RhB and TC together with relevant XRD and SEM
characterization proved the stability of Bi2MoO6/Bi2MoO6 in catalytic reactions. Transient
photocurrent densities, PL, and EIS data demonstrated that S3 can
separate and transfer photogenerated electrons and holes more efficiently
than Bi2MoO6. Photogenerated holes (h+) and superoxide radical anions (•O2–) were confirmed as the main active species by
radical-capture experiments, whereas •OH is not
relevant in the reaction. ESR data indicated that S3 can generate
more •O2– species than
Bi2MoO6 upon visible-light irradiation, whereas •OH is not generated for both S3 and Bi2MoO6. This work provides a simple and effective way for developing
Bi2MoO6-based photocatalysts that can work under
visible light.

Bi(NO3)3·5H2O, Na2MoO4·2H2O, HNO3, NaHCO3, RhB, MO, and CIP of
analytical grade were purchased from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent. TC
was purchased from Aladdin. All reagents were used as received.

4.2 Synthesis of Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6
Typically, 0.5 g of
Bi2MoO6 (0.82 mmol) prepared according to our
previous report29 was dispersed in 50 mL
deionized water with the aid of ultrasonic treatment for 15 min. A
certain amount (3, 5, 7, 9, or 11 mL) of NaHCO3 solution
(0.1 mol/L) was dropped therein under vigorous stirring (1200 rpm).
The mixture was further stirred continuously for 4 h. Bi2O2CO3/Bi2MoO6 samples
(denoted as S1–S5) were collected by removing the supernatant,
washed with deionized water three times, and dried at 60 °C for
24 h. The theoretical C/Bi molar ratios of S1–S5 samples, by
simply assuming that NaHCO3 reacts with Bi2MoO6 completely, are 1/5.5, 1/3.3, 1/2.3, 1/1.8, and 1/1.5, respectively.

4.3 Characterization
XRD data were obtained
on an MSAL XD2 X-ray diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation at
40 kV and 30 mA at a scanning speed of 8° min–1. SEM experiments were conducted on a Shimadzu SUPERSCAN SSX-550
field emission scanning electron microscope. TEM experiments were
performed using a JEOL JEM-2100F high-resolution transmission electron
microscope. FTIR spectra were recorded with a Thermo Fisher Nexus
670 FTIR spectrometer using a standard KBr disk method. XPS data were
obtained on a multifunctional photoelectron spectroscopy instrument
(Axis Ultra DLD, Kratos). Optical diffuse reflectance spectra were
recorded on a UV–vis–near-infrared spectroscopy scanning
spectrophotometer (LAMBDA 35, PerkinElmer) with an integrating sphere
accessory. PL experiments were conducted using a LabRAM HR Evolution
instrument (HORIBA JY Company, France) with an excitation wavelength
of 355 nm. EIS data were obtained by an electrochemical analyzer (CHI
660B Chenhua Instrument Company). Electron paramagnetic resonance
signals of paramagnetic species spin-trapped with DMPO were recorded
on a Bruker ESR 300E spectrometer.

4.4 Evaluation
of Photocatalytic Activity
Photocatalytic degradation of
RhB (10 mg/L), MO (10 mg/L), CIP (10
mg/L), and TC (5 mg/L) was conducted using a Xe lamp (300 W, HSX-F300,
Beijing NeT Technology Co., Ltd.) coupled with a UV-cutoff filter
(420 nm) as the light source.23,26,29,88−96 The distance between the lamp and the top of the beaker mouth was
ca. 15 cm. The temperature of the reaction system was controlled at
around 25 °C.

Before visible-light illumination, 30 mg
of the catalyst was suspended in 50 mL of solution in a 100 mL beaker,
and the suspension was stirred (800 rpm) for 30 min. Subsequently,
visible-light irradiation was conducted for 60 min for each experiment.
4 mL of the suspension was sampled every 15 min and separated by centrifugation
at a speed of 8000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was then analyzed
by using a UV-5200PC spectrometer. Cycling degradation experiments
involving RhB and TC were conducted according to the procedure reported
before.29
