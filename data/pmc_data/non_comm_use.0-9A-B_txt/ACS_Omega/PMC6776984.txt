PI3Kα
is a heterodimer protein consisting of two subunits
(p110α and p85α) which promotes various signaling pathways.
Oncogenic mutation in the catalytic subunit p110α of PI3Kα
at the 1047 position in the kinase domain substitutes the histidine
with arginine. This mutation brings about conformational transitions
in the protein complex. These transitions expose the membrane binding
region of PI3Kα, and then it independently binds to the cell
membrane through its kinase domain without the involvement of the
membrane-bound protein RAS. We observed notable changes between the
protein complexes (p110α–p85α) of native and mutant
structures at the atomic level using molecular dynamics simulations.
Simulation results revealed formation of a less number of hydrogen
bonds between the two subunits in the mutant protein complex which
led the two subunits to move away from each other. This increase in
distance between the subunits led to an expanded structure, thereby
increasing the flexibility of the protein complex. Furthermore, a
study of secondary structure elements and the electrostatic potential
of the protein also gave a molecular insight into the change in interaction
patterns of the protein with the plasma membrane. Our finding clearly
indicates the role of mutation in oncogenesis and provides an insight
into considering the structural aspects to handle this mutation.

==== Body
Introduction
Phosphatidylinositol
3 kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates the substrate
(PIP2) to generate the key signaling molecule (PIP3), which acts as
a secondary messenger and promotes downstream signaling of diverse
processes at the cellular level like differentiation, cell survival,
metabolism, and intracellular cell signalling.1−17

There are a total of eight PI3K isoforms
grouped into three definite classes (I, II, and III) on the basis
of their structure, function, tissue differentiation, activation mechanism,
and substrate specificities.2,7,12,16,18 A
catalytic and a regulatory subunit are present in heterodimeric class
I enzymes consisting of IA and IB subclasses. Class IA has p110 (α/β/δ,
which are gene products of PIK3CA/PIK3CB/PIK3CD, respectively) as
the catalytic subunit that interacts with p85 which acts as the regulatory
subunit.4−7,12

The PI3Kα
isoform of the class I PI3K is the most usually mutated in various
tumors of different body parts.6,19 It has p110α
as
the catalytic subunit and p85α as the regulatory subunit.13,20 P110α consists of five domains: (i) N terminal adapter-binding
domain (ABD) from residue 1–108, which interacts with p85α,
(ii) RAS-binding domain (RBD) from residue 190–291, which regulates
the interaction between p110α and RAS proteins on the plasma
membrane,9,16 (iii) the C2 domain from residue 330–480
responsible for binding of lipid particles, (iv) helical domain from
residue 525–696 which provides cleft for other domains, and
(v) kinase domain from residue 697–1068 comprising of different
binding (ATP and substrate) regions.2,13,15,21 Moreover, p85α
consists of five domains including the nSH2 and the cSH2, linked by
an intermediate region called the iSH2 domain from residue 431–600.2,5,6,13 P110α
only requires the iSH2 domain to associate with p85α but the
inhibition of the catalytic subunit can only occur when nSH2 is linked
to it.22,23

PI3Kα is activated by the binding
of adapter proteins like IRS-I and phosphorylated tyrosines to nSH2
and cSH2 domains of p85α.24 This
binding temporarily dislodges the inhibition activity of p85 and activates
p110.23,25 The activated protein phosphorylates the
substrate (PIP2) to PIP3 at the cell membrane to promote the signaling
cascades.2,21,26,27 To keep a check on the signaling cascade, the phosphatases,
PTEN, control the level of PIP3 by dephosphorylating it.1,15,28−32

P85α plays a dual role in the p110α–p85α
complex by not only stabilizing the p110α but also inhibiting
its basal kinase activity.5,11,22,23,33,34 Prior to activation, the regulatory subunit
generally interacts with its catalytic counterpart to inhibit membrane
binding and thereby inhibiting the activity of the kinase domain.35,36 The oncogenic mutation H1047R weakens the interaction between the
p110α and p85α subunits, which destabilizes the binding
interface between the two subunits.2

A RAS protein is abundantly present on the cell membrane and it assists
in association of the protein complex (PI3Kα) with the cell
membrane by binding to the RBD of the p110α.11,21,37,38 The interaction
of RAS with PI3Kα has been seen to activate PI3Kα, which
is synergistic to activation by RTKs. This also plays a role in localizing
PI3Kα to specific sites on the membrane where RAS is present
so that p110α can access the substrate.9,11,37,38

Over
7000 mutations have been noted in the PIK3CA gene, most of which have
been seen to cause tumorigenesis.2,21 The most common
mutations being H1047R of the kinase domain and E542K and E545K of
the helical domain.4,21 Kinase domain mutation does not
require the involvement of the RBD with the membrane protein RAS but
depends on p85α for activation.11,39 H1047R mutation
causes structural transformations in the kinase domain which increases
the membrane association of PI3Kα, thereby increasing the lipid
kinase activity.2 The mutant binds with
lipid molecules in a tighter association, in comparison to the native,
because of the conformational changes.40 In the mutant, the arginine residue at the 1047 position points
90° away from the orientation of the histidine residue at the
1047 position in the native. The arginine residue assembles 13 residues
from 1050 to 1062 to form a loop for the interaction with the cell
membrane which was otherwise disordered in the native. A different
loop (residues 864–874), which is already present in the kinase
domain for interaction with the cell membrane in the native, also
has a different conformation in the mutant.21,41 These
two loops come in contact with the cell membrane, thereby giving rise
to a tighter membrane association, which increases the lipid kinase
activity by allowing easy access to the membrane-bound substrate.2,21 The H1047R mutant independently localizes p110α to the cell
membrane because of the structural transitions.21 Attachment of p110α on the cell membrane initiates
the tumerogenic cell signaling cascade by continuous phosphorylation
of substrates in the absence of inhibitory effect of regulatory subunit
p85α.21

The primary motives
of our study were, first, to check the conformational profile of the
native and mutant protein and to observe the damaging structural transition
in the mutant as compared to the native. Second, to rationalize possible
reason for these transitional changes in the mutant and see how they
bring about changes in the interaction of the two subunits and in
the association of the catalytic subunit with the cell membrane.

This study reveals that upon mutation, p110α adopts an expanded
structure and has increased conformational flexibility, which dominantly
affects the hydrogen-bonding pattern between the two subunits (p110α–p85α).
Further, a significant secondary structural transition found in RBD
of mutant protein during dynamic simulation which alters its interaction
with the membrane-bound RAS protein. Also, important conformational
positioning identified at two essential loops L1 and L2 of the kinase
domain because of mutation which assists in oncogenic membrane localization
of the mutant protein where the RAS–RBD interaction is compromised.
The complete workflow of the study is represented in Figure 1.

Results and Discussion
The protein models generated through
X-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques present
very informative but static images of protein structures.42 However, the flexibility of a protein is important
for the formation of different binding interfaces and also affects
the stability of a protein.43 Proteins
acquire flexibility by altering structural conformations and these
perturbations in structures might be little, including just the rearrangement
of a couple of amino acid side chains or it might be huge and even
include folding of the whole protein. Possibly, a conformational change
that alters the flexibility of a protein may meddle with its biological
function.44 To get a molecular insight
into all the conformational changes taking place in the protein complex,
we made the native and the mutant protein structures of p110α
to go through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.45 RMSD was calculated for the C-α atoms of both the
complexes, and the results are shown in Figure 2. RMSD is a quantitative method to calculate
the similarity between two or more protein structures. RMSD results
revealed that both the complexes at 0 ns had different starting points
which was 0.25 nm for the native and 0.1 nm for the mutant. Then,
there was a rise in the values of both the protein complexes from
0 to 25 ns. The mutant showed the rise of a greater extent as compared
to the native structure with values reaching up to ∼0.45 nm
in mutant and ∼0.38 nm in native. From 25 to 100 ns, the RMSD
of both the complexes fluctuated at different rates, where the mutant
showed major fluctuations between 30 and 40 ns, and the native showed
major fluctuations at 100 ns. Gradually, the RMSD of both the complexes
converged to similar values. The differences in the RMSD values for
native and mutant protein structures of p110α indicate divergence
in both the protein structures, which could possibly affect the joining
of p110α and p85α subunits. These structural alterations
in the catalytic subunit may also affect the biological functioning
of the PI3Kα protein. The rate of fluctuations and the difference
in the average values of the native and mutant protein structures
provided basis for further structural analysis.

Figure 2 Time evolution of backbone
RMSDs are shown as
a function
of time of the native and mutant p110α protein structures at
300 K. The symbol coding scheme is as follows: native (black) and
mutant (red).

Solvent accessibility
surface area (SASA) studies were carried out to evaluate the surface
area of a biomolecule that is available to solvent molecules. It is
the amount of surface area of the protein which is allowed for binding.
A higher value of SASA denotes the relative expansion of the structure
or an expanded conformation whereas a lower value denotes a compact
conformation. The alteration in SASA of both the protein structures
is shown in the Figure 3i. We can see that there is a sudden increase in the SASA of the
mutant at 5 ns and the value reaching up to 540 nm2 as
compared to the native, which shows a dip in the value of SASA during
that time period with values reaching up to 495 nm2. Thereafter,
a loss in SASA of the mutant structure at 10 ns but the native does
not show that much fluctuation. After 10 ns, an increase in SASA of
mutants could be seen and continued to fluctuate at a higher level
than the native structure till 145 ns. An average value of SASA for
the native is around 500 nm2 whereas for the mutant is
around 530 nm2. The highest SASA value at this time interval
for native was 515 nm2 whereas for the mutant structure
it was 525 nm2. There is no region in the graph where the
native has a greater value of SASA as compared to the mutant. These
large fluctuations in the mutant protein denote significant structural
transitions. Increase in the SASA value of the mutant also shows relative
expansion of its structure, denoting that it has a more expanded conformation
than the native. SASA results were further seconded by the trajectories
of the hydrogen bond (H bond) analysis, and the alterations in the
conformational geometry were also validated by radius of gyration
(Rg) analysis.

and mutant
proteins. (i) SASA of native and mutant p110α vs time at 300
K. (ii) Radius of gyration of Cα atoms of native and mutant

as follows: native (black) and mutant (red).

The Rg is described as the root-mean-square
distance of the
mass weight of a group of atoms from their common center of mass.
It provides data concerning the dimensions of the protein. Rg analysis of mutant and native structures was
carried out to complement our RMSD and SASA results. In Figure 3ii, we can see that the value
of Rg for the mutant structure instantly
rises at 5 ns followed by a decrease at 10 ns, and then again followed
by an increase. We also observed similar fluctuations in SASA values
during the same time period (until 20 ns). After 20 ns, there was
no such major fluctuation in the graph, but a number of minor fluctuations
were visible throughout the graph. For the native protein, a few fluctuations
were visible at 5–20 ns and after 100 ns, but the overall value
of Rg was less than the mutant. The average
value of Rg for the native is about ∼3.31
nm whereas for the mutant is about ∼3.35 nm. The mutant has
considerably higher values of Rg and fluctuates
at a greater frequency throughout the simulation time that indicates
that the structure of the mutant is flexible throughout the simulation,
and its structure acquires an enlarged conformation. Larger fluctuations
within the Rg plot additionally indicate
that the mutant may be undergoing some major structural transitions.
According to the Rg graph, the conformation
of the native was seen to be sturdier in comparison to its counterpart
which tends to adopt an expanded conformation, thereby increasing
flexibility. SASA and Rg analysis performed
to get an insight into the geometrical behavior of the mutant and
native p110α. The expanded conformation of the p110α subunit
may alter its joining interface with the p85α subunit. Modifications
in protein–protein interfaces may lead to disorders or loss
of functionality, and thus protein interfaces have turned out to be
a standout amongst the most well-known new targets for rational drug
design.46,47 Further, we carried out H bond analysis
between the two subunits of PI3Kα to get an insight into the
binding interface of the two subunits and the effect of mutation at
the p110α subunit on the protein–protein interface.

Biological functioning of the proteins relies upon the correct orientation
and binding to other bio molecules in the system, such as nucleic
acids, ligands, other proteins, and lipids.48 H-bond formation is mainly responsible for maintaining a stable
structure of the protein, which also contributes to protein-binding
interfaces. H bonds formed by the native and mutant structures of
p110α with the regulatory subunit p85α were calculated
to find out the correlation between H bond formation and flexibility.
In Figure 4i, we can
see that the H bonds were formed between the catalytic and the regulatory
subunits of both the protein complexes. The graph indicates that the
native complex has greater number of H bonds because of which the
two subunits are in close proximity with each other. The average number
of H bonds in the native complex is ∼44 which is greater than
that formed in the mutant complex which is ∼30. This signifies
that the structure of the complex with the native p85α subunit
is more compact than the complex with the mutant subunit. The mutant
complex, differently, has a rather expanded conformation, making it
more flexible than the native complex. The loss in the number of H
bonds decreases the interaction between the two subunits and also
suggests that the residues, which were previously involved in H-bonding,
are now free to interact with other molecules. Therefore, when these
mutant and native protein complexes were put in a solvent, new H bonds
were formed between the protein complexes and the solvent. In Figure 4ii, we observed that
the mutant formed more bonds with the solvent. This is because the
residues, which were free for the interaction in the mutant, now formed
H bonds with the solvent. This also suggests increased flexibility
of mutant in comparison to the native structure as it has more tendency
to form new bonds.

of intramolecular hydrogen bonds of the p110α and the p85α
protein during the simulations. (ii) Average number of protein–solvent
intermolecular hydrogen bonds in native and mutant p110α proteins
vs time at 300 K. The symbol coding scheme is as follows: native (black)
and mutant (red).

In order to check the
effect of decreased
number of H bonds in the binding interface, we calculated the number
of contacts between two subunits (p110α–p85α) through
MD simulations, and the results were plotted on a graph. In Figure 5i, we can see that
the number of contacts in the native has increased from ∼10
000
contacts to ∼19 000 contacts. On the other hand, the number
of contacts between the subunits of the mutant protein complex has
decreased from ∼15 000 contacts to ∼12 000
contacts. These results are also in accordance with the other results
of MD simulation, and a possible reason for these results can be narrowed
down to loss of H bonds, which resulted in an expanded conformation,
allowing the two subunits to move apart from each other, thereby decreasing
the number of contacts between the subunits.

trajectory of native
and mutant proteins. (i) Number of contacts between the two subunits.
(ii) Distance between the two subunits. The symbol coding scheme is
as follows: native (black) and mutant (red).

Further, MD simulations
were performed to calculate the distance between the two subunits
(p110α–p85α) of the protein, and the results are
shown in Figure 5ii.
The distances of the mutant are represented in red while that of the
native is represented in black. Here, we observed that the distance
between the subunits gradually decreased in the native protein from
∼2.7 nm to about ∼2.55 nm, whereas this distance gradually
increased in the mutant protein from ∼2.5 nm to about ∼2.74
nm, denoting that the two subunits moved toward each other in the
native but moved away from each other in the mutant. These MD simulation
results complement previously done wet lab experiments, which reports
disturbances in the binding interface between the two subunits of
PI3Kα because of the H1047R mutation.2 This study provides a possible explanation based on the H bond and
number of contact analysis for moving apart of the catalytic and regulatory
subunits of PI3Kα. Moving away of the regulatory subunit from
the catalytic subunit could also be correlated with the uncontrolled
phosphorylation of the substrate, resulting in the initiation of the
tumerogenic cell-signaling cascade.21

To acquire more insight into the conformational alterations of the
two complexes, we used the DSSP tool which applies the H bond estimation
algorithm to assign secondary structures during the simulation time
period.49 The results obtained from the
DSSP program are shown in Figure S1. DSSP
results depicted that the α-helix, β sheet, coil, turns,
and bends are present in both the protein complexes. In Figure S1i,ii, we
can see that, from residue 325–450, more number of β-sheets
are present in the native structure, whereas this region of the mutant
shows lesser number of β-sheets and a larger number of bends
and coils, throughout the simulation time. In the native, the region
between residue 525–550 is dominated by α-helix whereas
this region of the mutant primarily has larger number of bends with
traces of coils present in it. The presence of α-helix is also
seen in the catalytic region between residue 925–950, which
is completely lost in the mutant. The loss in the number of α-helix
and β-sheets also confirms the expanded conformation of the
mutant. Coil and turn conformation tends to increase the flexibility
of any protein.50 The mutant conformation
has been observed to be flanked by coils and turns in regions which
were otherwise inhabited by the helix and sheet conformation in the
native. This is also a reason for increased flexibility of the mutant.
These results indicate changes in the catalytic and other domain,
which are essential for proper functioning and stability of the protein.

The protein stability mainly depends on factors such as the hydrogen
bonding, packing of hydrophobic core, and secondary structures of
the protein.51,52 Apart from these forces, several
studies have demonstrated the importance of charge–charge interactions
for the stability of proteins.53,54 In addition to providing
stability to the protein structure, the local and global electrostatic
properties play an essential role in protein functioning and binding.55,56 Hence, we studied the effect of mutation H1047R on the charge distribution
on the p110α subunit. Figure 6 shows the adaptive Poisson–Boltzmann solver
(APBS) and changes in secondary structural elements of the p110α
subunit. APBS provides with long-range intermolecular interactions
and effects of solvation on biomolecular interactions. We mainly emphasized
on two regions, the kinase domain and the RBD domain. From Figure 6i,iii, we can see
that there is a considerable loss in the number of secondary structure
elements (loops) in the RBD domain of the mutant as compared to the
native protein. The RBD domain of the mutant has a larger number of
helices as compared to the native protein’s RBD domain. These
conformational changes are also clear from Figure 6a,b. Here, we see that from residue 1–25
of the RBD domain in the native, a number of secondary structures
like β-sheets, bends, turns, and coils are present. However
in the same region of the mutant, the amount of β-sheets has
increased significantly, and the number of bends and turns has almost
declined to negligible. Another major difference is visible in the
region from residue 25–65 of the RBD domain. Here again, the
native has a number of secondary structures like α-helices,
3-helices, turns, bends, and coils present in the native, but the
same region in the mutant is dominated by the presence of α-helices
with a very insignificant amount of turns and bends. The coil and
turn secondary structure elements tend to make a protein more flexible
and prone to interactions with its partner. However, the secondary
structure elements like α-helices and β-sheets in comparison
to the loops make the protein structure more rigid and hinders it
from being involved in interactions with partner proteins.50 Because the RBD domain of the native protein
had abundance of coils, turns, and bends in its conformation, so it
was able to interact with the RAS protein of the plasma membrane and
assisted in localization of the protein complex to the membrane and
the change of these secondary structure elements primarily to α-helices
and β-sheets in the mutant caused the loss of interaction of
the RBD domain with the RAS protein. Moreover, this increase in number
of α-helices and β-sheets in the mutant causes a change
in the charge distribution of its RBD domain, and it can be seen in Figure 6iii,iv. The RBD domain
of the native protein has almost equal regions of negative and positive
charges, and the RBD domain of the mutant protein has the majority
of the region with a positive charge with very few regions of negative
or neutral charge. The change in the secondary structure elements
and in the charge distribution over the RBD domain could be the reason
for relaxation of PI3Kα of its interaction with its target protein
RBD on the plasma membrane.

turn (yellow), α-helix (blue), 5-helix (purple), and 3-helix
(gray). The color coding scheme for (i,iii) is as follows: cyan (RBD
domain), pink (kinase domain), and green (ABD, C2, helical). The color
coding scheme for (ii,iv) is as follows: red (region with the negative
charge), blue (region with the positive charge), and white (region
with the neutral charge).

In order to understand the reason
for direct attachment of kinase domain of PI3Kα to the cell
membrane, we further investigated the conformational changes due to
mutation in the p110α subunit and observed noticeable structural
change in the conformational alignment of the loops L1 and L2. Both
these loops act as a hook to bind to the cell membrane in the mutated
protein structure.19,39 The loop L1 of the kinase domain
is tilted away from the RBD domain in the native protein while it
is tilted toward the RBD domain in the mutant. Similarly, the loop
L2 also has a disordered conformation in the native protein and has
a more ordered structural conformation in the mutant protein. Also,
the region adjacent to the L1 loop in the native is dominated by the
presence of helices, whereas this region in the mutant is dominated
by the presence of loops. These results are also supported by the
DSSP results shown in Figures S1 and S2. The DSSP result of the mutant protein shown in Figure S2, shows that the RBD domain in the mutant has an
abundance of α-helices while from Figure S1, it is clear that the RBD domain of the native has regions
of coils and bends, and the α-helix region was quite diminished.
Even the region around the two loops L1 and L2 show a prominent α-helix
region in the native, while the mutant has an α-helix region
flanked with bends and turns. This change in conformation within the
kinase domain also brings about a change in the overall charge distribution
of the kinase domain. From Figure 6ii,iv, it is visible that the region where loop L2
is present is dominantly negatively charged in the native while it
is completely positively charged in the mutant protein. Even the area
around loop L1, which was dominated by helices in the native protein,
had a negative charge. Howevr in the mutant, this area was converted
to the positively charged region. To concede, there are two major
effects of mutation on the kinase domain of PI3Kα. Loops L1
and L2 acquires ordered conformations and orients themselves in a
hook-like structure. Second, a positive charge gets developed around
both the loops in the mutated structure. As we know that the cell
membrane is negatively charged, hence, the acquisition of positive
charge around the loops L1 and L2 in the p110α subunit would
favor the direct binding of kinase domain to the cell membrane because
of interactions between oppositely charged surfaces.

Conclusions
The mutation (H1047R) in PI3Kα
occurs in cancers of various organs like breast, colon, uterus, stomach,
and ovary.4,6,21 Studies show
that this mutation promotes tumorigenesis by increasing the activity
of the kinase domain which is achieved because it gets abundant supply
of substrates.21 This mutation also allows
the protein complex to attach directly to the cell membrane, independent
of the membrane-bound RAS protein.2 We
executed MD simulations of the protein complex (native and mutant)
in order to understand the conformational changes at the atomic level,
which leads to the abovementioned abnormalities.57,58 Our
results showed a notable decrease in H bond formation between the
two subunits of the protein complex in the mutant. Conformational
transitions due to mutation also increased the values of Rg and SASA, which also support the results of H bond analysis,
showing increased flexibility of the p110α subunit. The loss
of H bonds makes the two subunits to move apart from each other, thereby
increasing the distance and decreasing the number of contacts between
the two chains. These results also signify that the mutant protein
has an expanded conformation than the native. Increase in the flexibility
of the mutant is also supported by the results of H bond analysis
with the solvent. The increased distance between the catalytic subunit
and the regulatory subunit due to mutation could be the possible reason
for the uncontrolled phosphorylation of the substrate, resulting in
the initiation of tumerogenic cell-signaling cascade. Furthermore,
DSSP and charge distribution studies of the p110α subunit (native
and mutant) reveals changes in the region essential for binding to
the RAS protein. Moreover, mutation also encourages the loops L1 and
L2 to acquire an organized, hook-like structure, surrounded by a positive
charged surface which promotes the two loops L1 and L2 to be actively
involved in membrane localization of proteins without the involvement
of RBD and RAS proteins. These results provide an insight into the
changes at the molecular level due to mutation H1047R, resulting in
tumorigenesis, and could be further exploited to consider the abovementioned
structural aspects to handle this mutation.

Materials and Methods
Datasets
Two protein–protein complexes were used from the RCSB Protein
Data Bank, one is p110α–p85α (PDB id 4L1B)15 and second is p110α (H1047)–p85α (PDB
id 3HHM).21 We considered dimer of each protein complex,
where chain A holds 1068 amino acids, which were spread from residues
8–1068, and Chain B holds 277 amino acids and it was spread
from residues 322–598 amino acids. Native and mutant p110α–p85α
complex structures were solved at 2.5 and 2.8 Å resolution. Crystallized
heteroatoms were removed from its PDB files, and the same was done
to the water molecules. Missing loop regions were prepared by using
“prepare protein” protocol in discovery studio package
2017R2.

MD Simulation
MPI-enabled
GROMACS 5.0.6 was employed to carry out the MD simulations,59−61 which is installed in our in-house
hig1h-end computer cluster machine, and also used the CHARMM27 force
field.62 Starting points for the simulations
were both the protein complexes (native and mutant), and they were
also put into a solvated cubic box, which was filled with SPC water
molecules. Because at physiological pH (approx 7.4), the proteins
had a net positive charge, so we put in sodium ions (CL–) to this solvated cubic box using the “gmx genion”
script to electrically neutralize the simulation system. Energy minimization
protocols were further used to decrease the energy of the simulation
system in GROMACS. This minimized system was then put through MD simulations
which was positions restrained and had two steps. At first, within
a canonical ensemble, we performed for 10 ns succeeded by another
10 ns within a constant-temperature and -pressure ensemble. In this
type of MD simulations, the whole system is kept under control except
for the solvent molecules. This step is carried out to ensure equilibrium
of the water molecules surrounding the residues of our protein. The
system then attains pressure equilibrium and then attains density
equilibrium. Once the systems reached equilibrium over the time, they
are then put through MD simulations without any restriction for 170
ns, and further analysis was carried out on each equilibrated part
of the trajectories. A Berendsen thermostat was put to use for attaining
a steady temperature of 310 K in all simulations.63 The calculations of electrostatic and coulombic interactions
have been carried out by the Ewald method.64 All histidine residues were assumed neutral, and a pH of 7 was set
for their ionization states. A SHAKE algorithm was used to restrict
the bond lengths of H bonds, trimming both the long-range interaction
(Coulomb and van der Waals) at 1.0 nm and permitting a time step of
2 fs. After every 0.5 ps, the structures were saved and at ten steps,
the list of nonbonded pairs was amended. Several analyses were undertaken
by making use of files in GROMACS distribution containing various
scripts.59 The resultant files were examined
by “gmx rms”, “gmx gyrate”, “gmx
rmsf”, “gmx mindist”, and “gmx dssp”
of GROMACS to get RMSD, the radius of gyration (Rg), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) value, number
of contact (<0.6 nm), and distance between subunits and define
secondary structure of proteins plot (DSSP). We used “gmx hbond”
to get a count of the number of discrete H in the protein and calculated
by the donor–acceptor distance less than 0.35 nm and of donor–H–acceptor
angle greater than 150°. Moreover, the simulation snapshot structures
and trajectory analysis were managed by the Coot65 package. This investigation is primarily focused to study
the dynamic behavior of native as compared to its oncogenic mutant
proteins. We compared SASA and Rg of protein
to check the three-dimensional space of the p110α protein. In
order to study the conformational transitions of both the proteins,
we plotted SASA, Rg, and hydrogen bonds
of carbon-α of the system and distance of subunits and number
of contacts of subunits for all the simulations using the Grace toolkit
5.1.22 version.

RMSD Clustering
Structural transformation
of a protein can be better understood
by performing ensemble clustering on the simulation data.50 RMSD conformational clustering was then performed
on our protein using the GROMOS algorithm by using the “gmx
cluster” script.66 These results
aided us in the evaluation of three-dimensional heterogeneity in different
conformers of the protein. To find a more reasonable RMSD cut-off,
we first modified the C-α RMSD cut-off between 0.10 and 0.15
nm in steps of 0.02 and performed clustering analysis for each RMSD
cut-off value. Here, 0.13 nm was kept to be the C-α RMSD cut-off.
∼78% of all the protein structures carried the clusters predominantly.
The number of neighbors are counted by the GROMOS clustering method.
It is then used as a cut-off for identifying the structure which has
the largest number of neighbors. This structure is then used as the
center of the cluster. The pool of clusters is then refined by eliminating
all the neighbors of this structure. The same is repeated for every
structure in the pool until each structure has been alloted to a cluster.66

APBS Calculation
We took APBS calculations
for our native and mutant proteins to
tackle the long-ranged intermolecular interactions and the effects
of solvation on biomolecular processes of the protein clusters and
used the APBS plugin installed in PyMOL 1.8. While using the plugin,
we set all parameters to default and used the split-state script to
categorize different conformers in every cluster.
