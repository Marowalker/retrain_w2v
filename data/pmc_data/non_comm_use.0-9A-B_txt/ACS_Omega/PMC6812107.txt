Coalbed methane (CBM) is an unconventional
natural gas resource.
CBM mining releases a large amount of coproduced water, and the trace
elements of CBM coproduced water can provide a basis for the exploration
and development of CBM. The contents of eight major trace elements
in the produced water from wellhead were tested and analyzed based
on seven CBM wells in Tiefa Basin. The research indicates that Sr
and Ba are the dominant trace elements with the highest concentrations
in produced water. There is a positive correlation among Li, Sr, and
Rb by cluster analysis and correlation analysis, which may be affected
by the total dissolved solids and pH in the groundwater. The contents
of Li, Sr, and Ba increase with the burial depth of coal seam and
could be influenced by the fault. The gas production of CBM wells
is affected by the depth of the coal seams, and there is no significant
correlation between water production and the coal seam depth. However,
faults have an important impact on gas and water production. The productivity
of coalbed methane is affected by hydrogeological conditions and structure
because the productivity of CBM wells located in different tectonic
locations varies with the change of Li, Sr, and Ba contents.

==== Body
1 Introduction
Coalbed methane (CBM) is an important unconventional natural gas
resource.1,2 Commercial exploitation of CBM has been
established in the United States, Australia, China, Canada, and other
countries.3,4 Gas molecules diffuse and adsorb in coal
pore structure.5−8 CBM is adsorbed on the inner surface of coal by physical adsorption
and hydrostatic pressure of groundwater.9−11 After hydraulic fracturing,12 which is mined through drainage, pressure reduction,
desorption, diffusion, and seepage.13−16

In the Powder River Basin
of Wyoming, the main elements in coproduced
water are Al, As, B, Ba, Cr, Cu, F, Fe, Mn, Mo, Se, Zn, Ni, Co, and
Zn9,17−20 during CBM production. However,
the main elements are As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Mo, Ni, Pb, Sb, Se,
V, and Zn21 in Alberta, Canada. Different
from the United States and Canada, the main elements in Bide-Santang
Basin and Qinshui Basin, China are Li, Ga, Rb, Sr, Ba, Mo, Cr, As,
Se, V, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Ag, Cs, Pb, and U.22,23

Li and Rb are rare basic metals derived from albite-spodumene
lithium
mica, and their contents in water increase as total dissolved solids
(TDS) increase. Cr is a common element in groundwater in metal deposits
and is mainly enriched in the peridotite distribution area. Cu is
mainly derived from metal sulfide minerals, and redox conditions have
a great influence on the migration of Cu. The content of Cu in water
is limited by the pH. Both strontium and barium belong to the alkaline
earth metal group and are chemically close. Their content in groundwater
is affected by the Ca2+ and Mg2+ contents. Mn
is common in groundwater, and the rock is rich in manganese. A large
amount of manganese is released into the groundwater from the manganese
minerals in the rock when the rock is subjected to strong weathering,
decomposition, and leaching. The As content in groundwater and rocks
is generally low. The formation and enrichment of As in groundwater
are mainly related to the As content in the aqueous medium and the
pH of the groundwater.24

CBM occurrence
is closely related to groundwater hydrogeochemical
characteristics.25 Hydrogeochemistry in
underground water controls the enrichment and preservation of CBM,
as well as the gas production rate in the production process.23,26 Hydrogeochemical characteristics are useful for identifying the
groundwater flow paths,27 the source of
the produced water,26 CBM enrichment areas,
and guiding CBM development.28−30 Also, chemical research on produced
water is the basis for the management and effective utilization of
produced water.25 There is a certain relationship
among trace element concentration in produced water, formation depth,
and gas production.22 Trace element concentration
variation in produced water of different underground coal wells may
lead to changes in the CBM production level.9 Trace elements could indicate groundwater runoff and elucidate groundwater
circulation.31 The source of produced water
can be determined through the intersection method for trace elements.23

Low gas production wells have the characteristics
of the large
span between layers, high water yield, and low trace element concentration,
while high-yield gas wells are characterized by a short span between
layers, low water production, and high trace element concentration
in water produced.32 The concentrations
of trace elements are affected by the pH value.17,33 The concentrations of Al, Fe, As, Se, and F in the produced water
are significantly increased because of the substantial increase in
the pH.17 The content of trace elements
in pit drainage is higher than that in surface water, and the effluent
velocity has a great influence on acidity and trace elements level.34 Based on the test data and production data of
CBM wells in Tiefa Basin, this paper discusses the characteristics
of trace elements in produced water and studies the difference in
various tectonic locations. The relationship between the characteristics
of trace elements in produced water and the gas production rate is
also analyzed to guide CBM development in the region.

2 Geological Situation
The CBM development area in Tiefa Basin
is located in the northeast
of China (Figure 1),
which is situated in the sedimentary center of Tiefa Basin. The CBM
development area is mainly controlled by anticline and the fault (Figure 1). The whole area
is an anticline, which is divided into multiple structural blocks
by faults. The CBM wells are distributed in the same block, and the
block boundaries are controlled by faults (DF2, DF45, and F56). It
covers DT4, DT5, DT7, DT8, DT9, DT10, and DT23. Among them, DT6 and
DT23 are located near the fault, and the remaining CBM wells are located
in the anticline. The strata of the mining area are mainly composed
of Fuxin Group of the Lower Cretaceous, the Quantou Formation of the
Cretaceous, and the Quaternary of the Cenozoic. The Fuxin Formation
is the only coal-bearing strata (Figure 2). The Fuxin Formation consists of four parts:
the bottom glutenite member (K1f1), the lower
coal-bearing member (K1f2), the middle sand-mudstone
member (K1f3), and the upper coal-bearing member
(K1f4). The lower coal-bearing section (K1f2) contains 22 layers of coal, and the upper coal-bearing
section (K1f4) contains 23 layers of coal. The
buried depth range of the upper coal group roof is about 610–940
m. Centering on the anticline core, the burial depth of the coal seam
gradually deepens to the north, south, and west.

3 Sample
Collection and Testing
3.1 Sampling and Testing
The water samples
collected from six CBM wells DT3, DT4, DT7, DT9, DT10, and DT23 are
sampled five times. The sampling dates are June 1, June 22, July 24,
Aug 27, and Sept 22, 2011. DT6 is sampled four times; sampling dates
are June 1, June 22, July 24, and Aug 27. The coproduced water samples
from DT6 wells were absent due to no water produced on Sept 22, 2011.
The coproduced water was collected by sample bottles. Every sample
bottle was soaked for about 1 day in an acidic solution with 20% nitric
acid, and then, they were cleaned with deionized water. Moreover,
before sampling, the bottles should be rinsed at least twice with
sample water and then the water samples were sent to the laboratory.
The analytical test instrument was an inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometer. The test item is trace elements analysis, and the measured
elements include 40 elements. Eight high-content elements are selected
for analysis. These eight elements are Li, Cr, Mn, Cu, As, Rb, Sr,
and Ba.

3.2 Concentration of Elements
Table 1 lists the content
and average values of the above elements in different wells at different
times. In the test, the concentration of Sr in the produced water
of each CBM well is the highest among all of the trace elements, the
element concentration is between 1100 and 4011 ppb, and the average
value is 2232.29 ppb. The Ba concentration is also very high, with
a concentration range of 426.8–3780 ppb and an average value
of 1362.94 ppb. The concentration of Cu is the lowest, and the concentration
of the element ranges from 1.21 to 43.56 ppb with an average of 18.3
ppb. Table 2 lists
the average values of trace element concentrations for different wells
at the same sampling time. The average contents of Sr and Ba in each
CBM well exceed 1000 ppb, the maximum content of Sr reaches 2617.57
ppb, and the maximum content of Ba reaches 1693.50 ppb. Next, Li >
Cr > Mn and the average content of Li is greater than 100 ppb (Table 2). Li, Sr, and Ba
have higher concentrations, which is consistent with Guo’s
research at the Bide-Santang Basin.22

Results and Discussion
4.1 Chemical Composition Characteristics
in Produced
Water
The selected eight elements were analyzed for their
variation with time. Table 2 shows the average value of each element at different times. Figure 3 shows the variation
of the selected elements over time. The contents of Li, Mn, Rb, and
Sr in produced water have experienced a process of rising first and
then decreasing with time; the contents of As and Ba experienced a
process of rising volatility over time; the changes in the contents
of Cr and Cu showed some anomalies. The content of Cr in the water
sample dropped suddenly from 125 to 7 ppb on July 24, while the content
of Cu dropped sharply in the water sample on Sept 22 from 34 to 1.5
ppb. It can be seen from the spider diagram that the Cr and Cu are
abnormal (Figure 4).

4.2 Correlation
Analysis
Cluster analysis
is a mathematical classification method in multivariate statistics,
which regards the studied objects as in a multidimensional space.
The density relationship and similarity between the objects are studied
with mathematical methods to classify the objects reasonably.35 The correlation between the elements is analyzed
by SPSS software for R-type cluster analysis and correlation analysis.
Li, Sr, and Rb are closely related and can be classified as the first
class (Figure 5). Furthermore,
Li, Sr and Rb have a good positive correlation (Table 3 and Figure 6). The correlation coefficients between Li and Rb,
Li and Sr, Sr and Rb are 0.972, 0.706, and 0.759, respectively. A
very good positive correlation between Li and Rb, Li and Sr, Sr and
Rb is very clearly seen from Figure 6a–c.

Li, Rb, and Sr are all active metal elements and easily lose electrons
in an aqueous solution to produce metal cations.22 Li is mainly in the form of spodumene and lithium mica
in nature. Most of it is produced in granite. It is a deep acidic
igneous rock, and the weak alkaline environment can promote the dissolution
of Li ore. The higher the pH, the more it promotes the dissolution
of Li ore and increases the concentration of elements in the groundwater.
Meanwhile, both the Rb element and the Li element are alkaline metal
elements and their properties are similar to those of K. From the
viewpoint of solubility, they are easily migrated by water and increased
by the degree of mineralization. Rock is the source of Sr in natural
water. The chemical composition of water affects the migration of
Sr, and the concentration of Sr increases with the increase of mineralization.
The three elements are collectively affected by the degree of mineralization.
This may be the reason for a positive correlation between the concentrations
of Li, Rb, and Sr.

4.3 Variation of Trace Elements
Concentration
with Coal Seam Depth
The burial depths of coal seams of DT9,
DT7, DT10, DT3, DT4, DT6, and DT23 are 620, 670, 670, 700, 760, 860,
and 940 m, respectively. The concentration of trace elements in the
produced water of DT4 with a deeper burial depth is lower, while the
concentration of trace elements in the produced water of DT9 with
a shallower burial depth is higher (Table 4). Li, Sr, and Rb have a negative correlation
with the change of burial depth of coal seam, and the correlation
is good. R2 is 0.79, 0.92, and 0.71, all
exceeding 0.7 (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Relationship between the burial depth of the coal seam and the
element content.

The formation of trace elements in
groundwater is affected by the
leaching, adsorption, redox, and water mixing. The concentration of
trace elements is affected in many ways, such as the concentration
of conventional ions in groundwater, pH, and the content of trace
elements in the surrounding aqueous medium.

In Section 4.2, the concentrations of
Li, Sr, and Rb are affected by the degree
of TDS and pH. The ionic content and TDS in the water easily change
with the groundwater migration. According to the acid–base
balance principle  

The pH is also affected by conventional
ions in the water.15,36 CBM wells are located at different
structural locations, and the
groundwater runoff conditions are different. As the groundwater runoff
changes, the TDS and pH will be affected, resulting in changes in
trace elements.

4.4 Variation of Gas/Water
Production with Coal
Seam Depth
There is a negative correlation between water
production and gas production in CBM wells, gas production increases
with the depth, and water production decreases with the depth.22

Comparing Figure 8a,b, it can be seen that gas production and
water production generally show opposite trends and water production
is low when gas production is high. DT6 and DT23 are located near
the fault. The gas production and water production of wells near the
fault and ordinary wells were linearly fitted separately. There is
a certain correlation between gas production and the coal seam depth.
The gas production increases with the increase of coal seam depth,
but the gas production near the fault suddenly decreases (Figure 8b). The water production
did not show a significant correlation with the depth of the coal
seam and the fitting degree was low, which was different from Chen’s
research in the Bide-Santang Basin, and the water production near
the fault was large (Figure 8a). There is a strong hydraulic connection near the fault.
The faults communicate with the upper and lower aquifers, and the
groundwater recharge is strong, which leads to increase of water production
of the CBM wells. Meanwhile, the CBM storage conditions near the fault
are poor and the hydraulic transport will take away the CBM, resulting
in low CBM production. The gas production of CBM wells generally accords
with the law of increase with the increase in depth, but the impact
of faults on CBM production is more important. The fault is the main
controlling factor for water and gas production of the CBM well in
the area that is near to the fault.

Figure 8 Relationship between water production
and producing interval depth
(a) and relationship between gas production and producing interval
depth (b).

4.5 Variation
of Gas Productivity with Trace Element
Concentration
The trace element content in groundwater may
be related to the daily production of CBM. As shown in Figure 9, there is a negative correlation
between the daily gas production of most CBM wells (such as DT3, DT4,
DT9, and DT10) and the contents of Sr, Li, and Rb in produced water.
In contrast, the daily gas production of DT6 and DT23 showed a positive
correlation with the contents of Sr, Li, and Rb in produced water.

concentration in DT6 and DT23 (i).

The chemical composition of CBM produced water can reflect the
runoff and alternation of groundwater, and hydraulic migration, hydraulic
closure, and hydraulic closure affect the gas content of coal reservoirs.37 DT3, DT4, DT9, and DT10 are located at the anticlinal
wing and the core, while DT6 and DT23 are located near the fault.
The hydraulic connection near the fault is strong, and the groundwater
runoff is strong. The chemical characteristics of the coproduced water
in the CBM wells near the fault show abnormality because the coproduced
water from them may be mixed with nonreservoir water.38 Therefore, the anomalies of DT6 and DT23 may be affected
by faults. The concentration of elements at the fault is greatly affected
by the supply of external water. When the contents of Sr, Li, and
Rb increase, external water supply decreases and gas production increases.

5 Conclusions
(1) Sr and Ba are the dominated trace
elements in coproduced water in the CBM wells. The change of element
content with time shows a certain rule except some abnormal elements.
There is a positive correlation among Li, Sr, and Ba, which may be
affected by the TDS and pH in the groundwater.

(2) Lower contents of Li, Sr, and Ba exist
in CBM wells with a shallow depth of the coal seam. The contents of
Li, Sr, and Ba in CBM wells with a deeper burial depth of the coal
seam are higher. There is a certain relationship between the content
of trace elements and the depth of the coal seam. The groundwater
runoff changes the TDS and pH, resulting in changes in the concentration
of trace elements.

(3) The gas production rate has a reverse
trend with the water production rate. The gas production of CBM showed
a positive correlation with the depth of the coal seam, but the wells
near the fault showed an abnormality and the gas production decreased
suddenly. There is no significant correlation between the water production
and the depth of coal seams, but the water production in CBM wells
near the faults is abnormally high. The gas production and water production
of CBM wells are greatly affected by faults.

(4) The productivity of CBM is affected
by hydrogeological conditions and structure. The productivity of CBM
wells in the anticline decreases with the increase of Li, Sr, and
Ba contents. The productivity of CBM wells near the fault increases
with the increase of the contents of Li, Sr, and Ba. The coproduced
water in CBM wells near the fault is affected by the mixing of nonreservoir
water, resulting in abnormal gas production.
